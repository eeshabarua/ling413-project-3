2532,CXLVII,"Aloud and clear ""Monjoie"" again he cries."
2533,CXLVII,"To call Rollanz, his friend and peer, he tries:"
2534,CXLVII,"""My companion, come hither to my side."
2535,CXLVII,"With bitter grief we must us now divide."""

2540,CXLVIII,Then Rollant looked upon Olivier's face;
2541,CXLVIII,"Which was all wan and colourless and pale,"
2542,CXLVIII,"While the clear blood, out of his body sprayed,"
2543,CXLVIII,Upon the ground gushed forth and ran away.
2544,CXLVIII,"""God!"" said that count, ""What shall I do or say?"
2545,CXLVIII,"My companion, gallant for such ill fate!"
2546,CXLVIII,"Neer shall man be, against thee could prevail."
2547,CXLVIII,"Ah!  France the Douce, henceforth art thou made waste"
2548,CXLVIII,"Of vassals brave, confounded and disgraced!"
2549,CXLVIII,"Our Emperour shall suffer damage great."""

2555,CXLIX,"You'd seen Rollant aswoon there in his seat,"
2556,CXLIX,"And Oliver, who unto death doth bleed,"
2557,CXLIX,"So much he's bled, his eyes are dim and weak;"
2558,CXLIX,"Nor clear enough his vision, far or near,"
2559,CXLIX,To recognise whatever man he sees;
2560,CXLIX,"His companion, when each the other meets,"
2561,CXLIX,"Above the helm jewelled with gold he beats,"
2562,CXLIX,"Slicing it down from there to the nose-piece,"
2563,CXLIX,But not his head; he's touched not brow nor cheek.
2564,CXLIX,"At such a blow Rollant regards him keen,"
2565,CXLIX,"And asks of him, in gentle tones and sweet:"
2566,CXLIX,"""To do this thing, my comrade, did you mean?"
2567,CXLIX,"This is Rollanz, who ever held you dear;"
2568,CXLIX,"And no mistrust was ever us between."""
2569,CXLIX,"Says Oliver: ""Now can I hear you speak;"
2570,CXLIX,I see you not: may the Lord God you keep!
2571,CXLIX,"I struck you now: and for your pardon plead."""
2572,CXLIX,"Answers Rollanz: ""I am not hurt, indeed;"
2573,CXLIX,"I pardon you, before God's Throne and here."""
2574,CXLIX,"Upon these words, each to the other leans;"

2579,CL,Oliver feels death's anguish on him now;
2580,CL,And in his head his two eyes swimming round;
2581,CL,Nothing he sees; he hears not any sound;
2582,CL,"Dismounting then, he kneels upon the ground,"
2583,CL,"Proclaims his sins both firmly and aloud,"
2584,CL,"Clasps his two hands, heavenwards holds them out,"
2585,CL,Prays God himself in Paradise to allow;
2586,CL,"Blessings on Charles, and on Douce France he vows,"
2587,CL,"And his comrade, Rollanz, to whom he's bound."
2588,CL,Then his heart fails; his helmet nods and bows;
2589,CL,Upon the earth he lays his whole length out:
2590,CL,"And he is dead, may stay no more, that count."
2591,CL,Rollanz the brave mourns him with grief profound;
2592,CL,Nowhere on earth so sad a man you'd found.
2593,CL,
2594,CLI,CLI
2595,CLI,
2596,CLI,So Rollant's friend is dead whom when he sees
2597,CLI,"Face to the ground, and biting it with's teeth,"
2598,CLI,Begins to mourn in language very sweet:
2599,CLI,"""Unlucky, friend, your courage was indeed!"
2600,CLI,Together we have spent such days and years;
2601,CLI,No harmful thing twixt thee and me has been.
2602,CLI,"Now thou art dead, and all my life a grief."""
2603,CLI,"And with these words again he swoons, that chief,"
2604,CLI,"Upon his horse, which he calls Veillantif;"
2605,CLI,Stirrups of gold support him underneath;
2606,CLI,"He cannot fall, whichever way he lean."

2608,CLII,CLII
2609,CLII,
2610,CLII,"Soon as Rollant his senses won and knew,"
2611,CLII,Recovering and turning from that swoon.
2612,CLII,Bitter great loss appeared there in his view:
2613,CLII,"Dead are the Franks; he'd all of them to lose,"
2614,CLII,"Save the Archbishop, and save Gualter del Hum;"
2615,CLII,"He is come down out of the mountains, who"
2616,CLII,Gainst Spanish men made there a great ado;
2617,CLII,"Dead are his men, for those the pagans slew;"
2618,CLII,"Will he or nill, along the vales he flew,"
2619,CLII,"And called Rollant, to bring him succour soon:"
2620,CLII,"""Ah!  Gentle count, brave soldier, where are you?"
2621,CLII,For By thy side no fear I ever knew.
2622,CLII,"Gualter it is, who conquered Maelgut,"
2623,CLII,And nephew was to hoary old Drouin;
2624,CLII,My vassalage thou ever thoughtest good.
2625,CLII,"Broken my spear, and split my shield in two;"
2626,CLII,Gone is the mail that on my hauberk grew;
2627,CLII,This body of mine eight lances have gone through;
2628,CLII,"I'm dying.  Yet full price for life I took."""
2629,CLII,"Rollant has heard these words and understood,"

2635,CLIII,Grief gives Rollanz intolerance and pride;

2638,CLIII,"Gualter has six, the Archbishop other five."
2639,CLIII,"The pagans say: ""Men, these, of felon kind!"

2676,CLV,"He's drawn Almace, whose steel was brown and rough,"

2941,CLXXI,"The steel cries out, but does not break outright;"
2942,CLXXI,"And the count says: ""Saint Mary, be my guide"
2943,CLXXI,"Good Durendal, unlucky is your plight!"
2944,CLXXI,I've need of you no more; spent is my pride!
2945,CLXXI,"We in the field have won so many fights,"
2946,CLXXI,Combating through so many regions wide
2947,CLXXI,"That Charles holds, whose beard is hoary white!"
2948,CLXXI,Be you not his that turns from any in flight!
2949,CLXXI,A good vassal has held you this long time;

2953,CLXXII,
2954,CLXXII,Rollant hath struck the sardonyx terrace;
2955,CLXXII,"The steel cries out, but broken is no ways."
2956,CLXXII,"So when he sees he never can it break,"
2957,CLXXII,Within himself begins he to complain:
2958,CLXXII,"""Ah!  Durendal, white art thou, clear of stain!"
2959,CLXXII,Beneath the sun reflecting back his rays!
2960,CLXXII,"In Moriane was Charles, in the vale,"
2961,CLXXII,When from heaven God by His angel bade
2962,CLXXII,Him give thee to a count and capitain;
2963,CLXXII,Girt thee on me that noble King and great.
2964,CLXXII,"I won for him with thee Anjou, Bretaigne,"
2965,CLXXII,"And won for him with thee Peitou, the Maine,"
2966,CLXXII,"And Normandy the free for him I gained,"
2967,CLXXII,"Also with thee Provence and Equitaigne,"
2968,CLXXII,"And Lumbardie and all the whole Romaigne,"
2969,CLXXII,"I won Baivere, all Flanders in the plain,"
2970,CLXXII,"Also Burguigne and all the whole Puillane,"
2971,CLXXII,"Costentinnople, that homage to him pays;"
2972,CLXXII,In Saisonie all is as he ordains;
2973,CLXXII,"With thee I won him Scotland, Ireland, Wales,"
2974,CLXXII,"England also, where he his chamber makes;"
2975,CLXXII,Won I with thee so many countries strange
2976,CLXXII,"That Charles holds, whose beard is white with age!"
2977,CLXXII,"For this sword's sake sorrow upon me weighs,"
2978,CLXXII,"Rather I'ld die, than it mid pagans stay."

2983,CLXXIII,"Rollant his stroke on a dark stone repeats,"
2984,CLXXIII,And more of it breaks off than I can speak.
2985,CLXXIII,"The sword cries out, yet breaks not in the least,"
2986,CLXXIII,Back from the blow into the air it leaps.
2987,CLXXIII,"Destroy it can he not; which when he sees,"
2988,CLXXIII,Within himself he makes a plaint most sweet.
2989,CLXXIII,"""Ah! Durendal, most holy, fair indeed!"
2990,CLXXIII,Relics enough thy golden hilt conceals:
2991,CLXXIII,"Saint Peter's Tooth, the Blood of Saint Basile,"
2992,CLXXIII,"Some of the Hairs of my Lord, Saint Denise,"
2993,CLXXIII,"Some of the Robe, was worn by Saint Mary."
2994,CLXXIII,"It is not right that pagans should thee seize,"
2995,CLXXIII,For Christian men your use shall ever be.
2996,CLXXIII,Nor any man's that worketh cowardice!
2997,CLXXIII,Many broad lands with you have I retrieved
2998,CLXXIII,"Which Charles holds, who hath the great white beard;"

3003,CLXXIV,But Rollant felt that death had made a way
3004,CLXXIV,Down from his head till on his heart it lay;
3005,CLXXIV,"Beneath a pine running in haste he came,"
3006,CLXXIV,On the green grass he lay there on his face;
3007,CLXXIV,"His olifant and sword beneath him placed,"
3008,CLXXIV,"Turning his head towards the pagan race,"
3009,CLXXIV,"Now this he did, in truth, that Charles might say"
3010,CLXXIV,(As he desired) and all the Franks his race;--
3011,CLXXIV,"'Ah, gentle count; conquering he was slain!'--"
3012,CLXXIV,"He owned his faults often and every way,"
3013,CLXXIV,And for his sins his glove to God upraised.

3019,CLXXV,"Looking to Spain, he lies on a sharp peak,"
3020,CLXXV,And with one hand upon his breast he beats:
3021,CLXXV,"""Mea Culpa!  God, by Thy Virtues clean"
3022,CLXXV,"Me from my sins, the mortal and the mean,"
3023,CLXXV,Which from the hour that I was born have been

3034,CLXXVI,"So many lands where he went conquering,"
3035,CLXXVI,"And France the Douce, the heroes of his kin,"
3036,CLXXVI,"And Charlemagne, his lord who nourished him."
3037,CLXXVI,Nor can he help but weep and sigh at this.
3038,CLXXVI,"But his own self, he's not forgotten him,"
3039,CLXXVI,"He owns his faults, and God's forgiveness bids:"
3040,CLXXVI,"""Very Father, in Whom no falsehood is,"
3041,CLXXVI,"Saint Lazaron from death Thou didst remit,"

3049,CLXXVI,"God sent him down His angel cherubin,"
3050,CLXXVI,"And Saint Michael, we worship in peril;"
3051,CLXXVI,And by their side Saint Gabriel alit;

3056,CLXXVII,Rollant is dead; his soul to heav'n God bare.
3057,CLXXVII,That Emperour to Rencesvals doth fare.
3058,CLXXVII,There was no path nor passage anywhere

3085,CLXXVIII,"Thereon Duke Neimes doth act with wisdom proof,"
3086,CLXXVIII,First before all he's said to the Emperour:
3087,CLXXVIII,"""See beforehand, a league from us or two,"
3088,CLXXVIII,From the highways dust rising in our view;
3089,CLXXVIII,"Pagans are there, and many them, too."

3117,CLXXIX,"Put off the night, and still prolong the day."
3118,CLXXIX,"An angel then, with him should reason make,"
3119,CLXXIX,Nimbly enough appeared to him and spake:

3130,CLXXX,"So pagans fled, and chased them well the Franks"
3131,CLXXX,"Through the Valley of Shadows, close in hand;"
3132,CLXXX,"Towards Sarraguce by force they chased them back,"
3133,CLXXX,And as they went with killing blows attacked:
3134,CLXXX,Barred their highways and every path they had.
3135,CLXXX,"The River Sebre before them reared its bank,"

3185,CLXXXIII,"Charles, by God's grace, possessed its point of steel!"
3186,CLXXXIII,His golden hilt he enshrined it underneath.
3187,CLXXXIII,By that honour and by that sanctity

3218,CLXXXV,"Charles looked up towards the sky, and there"

3224,CLXXXV,"Also their shields, e'en the golden bosses,"
3225,CLXXXV,"Crumbled the shafts of their trenchant lances,"
3226,CLXXXV,Crushed their hauberks and all their steel helmets.
3227,CLXXXV,His chevaliers he saw in great distress.
3228,CLXXXV,Bears and leopards would feed upon them next;
3229,CLXXXV,"Adversaries, dragons, wyverns, serpents,"

3235,CLXXXV,"Out of a wood came a great lion then,"
3236,CLXXXV,'Twas very proud and fierce and terrible;
3237,CLXXXV,"His body dear sought out, and on him leapt,"

3246,CLXXXVI,And that he held a bruin by two chains;
3247,CLXXXVI,"Out of Ardenne saw thirty bears that came,"
3248,CLXXXVI,"And each of them words, as a man might, spake"
3249,CLXXXVI,"Said to him: ""Sire, give him to us again!"
3250,CLXXXVI,"It is not right that he with you remain,"
3251,CLXXXVI,"He's of our kin, and we must lend him aid."""
3252,CLXXXVI,"A harrier fair ran out of his palace,"
3253,CLXXXVI,Among them all the greatest bear assailed
3254,CLXXXVI,"On the green grass, beyond his friends some way."
3255,CLXXXVI,There saw the King marvellous give and take;
3256,CLXXXVI,"But he knew not which fell, nor which o'ercame."
3257,CLXXXVI,The angel of God so much to him made plain.
3258,CLXXXVI,Charles slept on till the clear dawn of day.

3261,CLXXXVII,
3262,CLXXXVII,"King Marsilies, fleeing to Sarraguce,"
3263,CLXXXVII,Dismounted there beneath an olive cool;
3264,CLXXXVII,"His sword and sark and helm aside he put,"
3265,CLXXXVII,On the green grass lay down in shame and gloom;
3266,CLXXXVII,"For his right hand he'd lost, 'twas clean cut through;"
3267,CLXXXVII,"Such blood he'd shed, in anguish keen he swooned."
3268,CLXXXVII,Before his face his lady Bramimunde
3269,CLXXXVII,"Bewailed and cried, with very bitter rue;"
3270,CLXXXVII,"Twenty thousand and more around him stood,"
3271,CLXXXVII,All of them cursed Carlun and France the Douce.
3272,CLXXXVII,"Then Apollin in's grotto they surround,"
3273,CLXXXVII,"And threaten him, and ugly words pronounce:"
3274,CLXXXVII,"""Such shame on us, vile god!, why bringest thou?"
3275,CLXXXVII,This is our king; wherefore dost him confound?
3276,CLXXXVII,"Who served thee oft, ill recompense hath found."""
3277,CLXXXVII,"Then they take off his sceptre and his crown,"
3278,CLXXXVII,"With their hands hang him from a column down,"
3279,CLXXXVII,"Among their feet trample him on the ground,"
3280,CLXXXVII,With great cudgels they batter him and trounce.
3281,CLXXXVII,"From Tervagant his carbuncle they impound,"
3282,CLXXXVII,"And Mahumet into a ditch fling out,"

3290,CLXXXVIII,"And Bramimunde laments for him, the queen,"
3291,CLXXXVIII,Tearing her hair; caitiff herself she clepes;

3293,CLXXXVIII,"""Ah!  Sarraguce, henceforth forlorn thou'lt be"
3294,CLXXXVIII,Of the fair king that had thee in his keep!

3297,CLXXXVIII,"That admiral will shew his cowardice,"
3298,CLXXXVIII,"Unless he fight against that race hardy,"
3299,CLXXXVIII,"Who are so fierce, for life they take no heed."
3300,CLXXXVIII,"That Emperour, with his blossoming beard,"
3301,CLXXXVIII,"Hath vassalage, and very high folly;"

3310,CLXXXIX,King Marsilies was therefore sore displeased;
3311,CLXXXIX,In the first year he sealed and sent his brief
3312,CLXXXIX,"To Baligant, into Babilonie:"
3313,CLXXXIX,"('Twas the admiral, old in antiquity,"
3314,CLXXXIX,"That clean outlived Omer and Virgilie,)"
3315,CLXXXIX,"To Sarraguce, with succour bade him speed,"
3316,CLXXXIX,"For, if he failed, Marsile his gods would leave,"
3317,CLXXXIX,All his idols he worshipped formerly;
3318,CLXXXIX,He would receive blest Christianity
3319,CLXXXIX,And reconciled to Charlemagne would be.
3320,CLXXXIX,"Long time that one came not, far off was he."
3321,CLXXXIX,Through forty realms he did his tribes rally;
3322,CLXXXIX,"His great dromonds, he made them all ready,"
3323,CLXXXIX,Barges and skiffs and ships and galleries;
3324,CLXXXIX,"Neath Alexandre, a haven next the sea,"
3325,CLXXXIX,In readiness he gat his whole navy.
3326,CLXXXIX,"That was in May, first summer of the year,"

3333,CXC,"High on their yards, at their mast-heads they place"
3334,CXC,"Lanterns enough, and carbuncles so great"
3335,CXC,"Thence, from above, such light they dissipate"
3336,CXC,The sea's more clear at midnight than by day.
3337,CXC,And when they come into the land of Spain
3338,CXC,All that country lightens and shines again:
3339,CXC,Of their coming Marsile has heard the tale.

3344,CXCI,"The pagan race would never rest, but come"

3347,CXCI,Upstream by Sebre doth all their navy turn.
3348,CXCI,"Lanterns they have, and carbuncles enough,"
3349,CXCI,That all night long and very clearly burn.
3350,CXCI,Upon that day they come to Sarragus.

3356,CXCII,"Out of his barge issues their admiral,"
3357,CXCII,"Espaneliz goes forth at his right hand,"
3358,CXCII,"Seventeen kings follow him in a band,"
3359,CXCII,"Counts too, and dukes; I cannot tell of that."
3360,CXCII,"Where in a field, midway, a laurel stands,"
3361,CXCII,"On the green grass they spread a white silk mat,"
3362,CXCII,"Set a fald-stool there, made of olifant;"
3363,CXCII,"Sits him thereon the pagan Baligant,"
3364,CXCII,And all the rest in rows about him stand.
3365,CXCII,The lord of them speaks before any man:
3366,CXCII,"""Listen to me, free knights and valiant!"
3367,CXCII,"Charles the King, the Emperour of the Franks,"
3368,CXCII,"Shall not eat bread, save when that I command."
3369,CXCII,Throughout all Spain great war with me he's had;
3370,CXCII,"I will go seek him now, into Douce France,"
3371,CXCII,"I will not cease, while I'm a living man,"
3372,CXCII,"Till be slain, or fall between my hands."""
3373,CXCII,Upon his knee his right-hand glove he slaps.

3379,CXCIII,"But go to Aix, where Charles court is held:"
3380,CXCIII,"His men applaud, for so they counselled."
3381,CXCIII,"After he called two of his chevaliers,"
3382,CXCIII,"One Clarifan, and the other Clarien:"

3392,CXCIII,"Bid him come here, his homage to declare."
3393,CXCIII,"To France I'll go, and war with Charles again;"
3394,CXCIII,"Save at my feet he kneel, and mercy beg,"

3406,CXCIV,"Through all the streets, wherein the burghers crowd."
3407,CXCIV,"When they draw nigh the citadel above,"
3408,CXCIV,From the palace they hear a mighty sound;
3409,CXCIV,"About that place are seen pagans enough,"
3410,CXCIV,"Who weep and cry, with grief are waxen wood,"
3411,CXCIV,"And curse their gods, Tervagan and Mahum"
3412,CXCIV,"And Apolin, from whom no help is come."
3413,CXCIV,"Says each to each: ""Caitiffs!  What shall be done?"
3414,CXCIV,"For upon us confusion vile is come,"
3415,CXCIV,"Now have we lost our king Marsiliun,"
3416,CXCIV,For yesterday his hand count Rollanz cut;
3417,CXCIV,"We'll have no more Fair Jursaleu, his son;"

3426,CXCV,To the palace they climb the topmost steep.
3427,CXCV,"When they're come in, the vaulted roof beneath,"
3428,CXCV,Marsilium with courtesy they greet:
3429,CXCV,"""May Mahumet, who all of us doth keep,"

3436,CXCV,"My lord they failed in battle, in his need,"
3437,CXCV,Never again will he his right hand see;
3438,CXCV,"For that rich count, Rollanz, hath made him bleed."
3439,CXCV,All our whole Spain shall be for Charles to keep.

3456,CXCVI,"Says Bramimunde: ""Unlucky journey, that!"
3457,CXCVI,Far nearer here you'll light upon the Franks;

3459,CXCVI,"That Emperour is bold and combatant,"
3460,CXCVI,Rather he'ld die than from the field draw back;
3461,CXCVI,No king neath heav'n above a child he ranks.
3462,CXCVI,Charles hath no fear for any living man.

3473,CXCVII,"My claim to him, if he will take't, I yield;"
3474,CXCVII,But from the Franks he then must set her free.
3475,CXCVII,Gainst Charlemagne I'll shew him strategy.
3476,CXCVII,Within a month from now he'll conquered be.

3503,CXCIX,"Says Clarien: ""To death he's stricken down."
3504,CXCIX,That Emperour was in the pass but now;
3505,CXCIX,"To France the Douce he would be homeward-bound,"
3506,CXCIX,"Rereward he set, to save his great honour:"
3507,CXCIX,"His nephew there installed, Rollanz the count,"
3508,CXCIX,And Oliver; the dozen peers around;
3509,CXCIX,A thousand score of Franks in armour found.
3510,CXCIX,"Marsile the king fought with them there, so proud;"
3511,CXCIX,He and Rollanz upon that field did joust.
3512,CXCIX,With Durendal he dealt him such a clout

3514,CXCIX,"His son is dead, in whom his heart was bound,"
3515,CXCIX,And the barons that service to him vowed;

4540,CCLIX,Many great blows on 's shield each gave and took;
4541,CCLIX,"The leather pierced, and doubled core of wood;"
4542,CCLIX,"Down fell the nails, the buckles brake in two;"
4543,CCLIX,"Still they struck on, bare in their sarks they stood."
4544,CCLIX,From their bright helms the light shone forth anew.
4545,CCLIX,Finish nor fail that battle never could
4546,CCLIX,But one of them must in the wrong be proved.

4551,CCLX,"Says the admiral: ""Nay, Charles, think, I beg,"
4552,CCLX,And counsel take that t'wards me thou repent!
4553,CCLX,"Thou'st slain my son, I know that very well;"
4554,CCLX,Most wrongfully my land thou challengest;
4555,CCLX,"Become my man, a fief from me thou'lt get;"
4556,CCLX,"Come, serving me, from here to the Orient!"""
4557,CCLX,"Charle answers him: ""That were most vile offence;"
4558,CCLX,No peace nor love may I to pagan lend.
4559,CCLX,"Receive the Law that God to us presents,"
4560,CCLX,"Christianity, and then I'll love thee well;"
4561,CCLX,"Serve and believe the King Omnipotent!"""

4568,CCLXI,In the admiral is much great virtue found;
4569,CCLXI,"He strikes Carlun on his steel helm so brown,"
4570,CCLXI,"Has broken it and rent, above his brow,"
4571,CCLXI,"Through his thick hair the sword goes glancing round,"
4572,CCLXI,"A great palm's breadth and more of flesh cuts out,"
4573,CCLXI,"So that all bare the bone is, in that wound."
4574,CCLXI,"Charles tottereth, falls nearly to the ground;"
4575,CCLXI,God wills not he be slain or overpow'red.
4576,CCLXI,"Saint Gabriel once more to him comes down,"
4577,CCLXI,"And questions him ""Great King, what doest thou?"""
4578,CCLXI,
4579,CCLXII,CCLXII
4580,CCLXII,
4581,CCLXII,"Charles, hearing how that holy Angel spake,"
4582,CCLXII,"Had fear of death no longer, nor dismay;"
4583,CCLXII,Remembrance and a fresh vigour he's gained.
4584,CCLXII,"So the admiral he strikes with France's blade,"
4585,CCLXII,"His helmet breaks, whereon the jewels blaze,"
4586,CCLXII,"Slices his head, to scatter all his brains,"
4587,CCLXII,"And, down unto the white beard, all his face;"
4588,CCLXII,"So he falls dead, recovers not again."
4589,CCLXII,"""Monjoie,"" cries Charles, that all may know the tale."
4590,CCLXII,"Upon that word is come to him Duke Naimes,"
4591,CCLXII,"Holds Tencendur, bids mount that King so Great."
4592,CCLXII,"Pagans turn back, God wills not they remain."
4593,CCLXII,"And Franks have all their wish, be that what may."
4594,CCLXII,
4595,CCLXIII,CCLXIII
4596,CCLXIII,
4597,CCLXIII,"Pagans are fled, ev'n as the Lord God wills;"
4598,CCLXIII,"Chase them the Franks, and the Emperour therewith."
4599,CCLXIII,"Says the King then: ""My Lords, avenge your ills,"
4600,CCLXIII,"Unto your hearts' content, do what you will!"
4601,CCLXIII,"For tears, this morn, I saw your eyes did spill."""
4602,CCLXIII,"Answer the Franks: ""Sir, even so we will."""
4603,CCLXIII,"Then such great blows, as each may strike, he gives"
4604,CCLXIII,"That few escape, of those remain there still."

4606,CCLXIV,CCLXIV
4607,CCLXIV,
4608,CCLXIV,"Great was the heat, the dust arose and blew;"
4609,CCLXIV,"Still pagans fled, and hotly Franks pursued."
4610,CCLXIV,The chase endured from there to Sarraguce.
4611,CCLXIV,"On her tower, high up clomb Bramimunde,"
4612,CCLXIV,Around her there the clerks and canons stood
4613,CCLXIV,"Of the false law, whom God ne'er loved nor knew;"
4614,CCLXIV,"Orders they'd none, nor were their heads tonsured."
4615,CCLXIV,And when she saw those Arrabits confused
4616,CCLXIV,"Aloud she cried: ""Give us your aid, Mahume!"
4617,CCLXIV,"Ah!  Noble king, conquered are all our troops,"
4618,CCLXIV,"And the admiral to shameful slaughter put!"""
4619,CCLXIV,"When Marsile heard, towards the wall he looked,"
4620,CCLXIV,"Wept from his eyes, and all his body stooped,"
4621,CCLXIV,So died of grief.  With sins he's so corrupt;
4622,CCLXIV,The soul of him to Hell live devils took.
4623,CCLXIV,
4624,CCLXV,CCLXV
4625,CCLXV,
4626,CCLXV,Pagans are slain; the rest are put to rout
4627,CCLXV,Whom Charles hath in battle overpowered.
4628,CCLXV,"Of Sarraguce the gates he's battered down,"
4629,CCLXV,For well he knows there's no defence there now;
4630,CCLXV,"In come his men, he occupies that town;"
4631,CCLXV,And all that night they lie there in their pow'r.
4632,CCLXV,"Fierce is that King, with 's hoary beard, and proud,"
4633,CCLXV,And Bramimunde hath yielded up her towers;
4634,CCLXV,"But ten ere great, and lesser fifty around."
4635,CCLXV,Great exploits his whom the Lord God endows!

4637,CCLXVI,CCLXVI
4638,CCLXVI,
4639,CCLXVI,"Passes the day, the darkness is grown deep,"
4640,CCLXVI,"But all the stars burn, and the moon shines clear."
4641,CCLXVI,And Sarraguce is in the Emperour's keep.
4642,CCLXVI,"A thousand Franks he bids seek through the streets,"
4643,CCLXVI,The synagogues and the mahumeries;
4644,CCLXVI,With iron malls and axes which they wield
4645,CCLXVI,They break the idols and all the imageries;
4646,CCLXVI,So there remain no fraud nor falsity.
4647,CCLXVI,"That King fears God, and would do His service,"
4648,CCLXVI,"On water then Bishops their blessing speak,"
4649,CCLXVI,And pagans bring into the baptistry.
4650,CCLXVI,If any Charles with contradiction meet
4651,CCLXVI,Then hanged or burned or slaughtered shall he be.
4652,CCLXVI,"Five score thousand and more are thus redeemed,"
4653,CCLXVI,Very Christians; save that alone the queen
4654,CCLXVI,To France the Douce goes in captivity;
4655,CCLXVI,By love the King will her conversion seek.
4656,CCLXVI,
4657,CCLXVII,CCLXVII
4658,CCLXVII,
4659,CCLXVII,"Passes the night, the clear day opens now."
4660,CCLXVII,Of Sarraguce Charles garrisons the tow'rs;
4661,CCLXVII,"A thousand knights he's left there, fighters stout;"
4662,CCLXVII,Who guard that town as bids their Emperour.
4663,CCLXVII,"After, the King and all his army mount,"
4664,CCLXVII,"And Bramimunde a prisoner is bound,"
4665,CCLXVII,"No harm to her, but only good he's vowed."
4666,CCLXVII,"So are they come, with joy and gladness out,"
4667,CCLXVII,"They pass Nerbone by force and by vigour,"
4668,CCLXVII,"Come to Burdele, that city of high valour."
4669,CCLXVII,"Above the altar, to Saint Sevrin endowed,"
4670,CCLXVII,"Stands the olifant, with golden pieces bound;"
4671,CCLXVII,"All the pilgrims may see it, who thither crowd."
4672,CCLXVII,"Passing Girunde in great ships, there abound,"
4673,CCLXVII,Ev'n unto Blaive he's brought his nephew down
4674,CCLXVII,"And Oliver, his noble companioun,"
4675,CCLXVII,"And the Archbishop, who was so wise and proud."
4676,CCLXVII,In white coffers he bids them lay those counts
4677,CCLXVII,At Saint Romain: So rest they in that ground.
4678,CCLXVII,Franks them to God and to His Angels vow.
4679,CCLXVII,"Charles canters on, by valleys and by mounts,"
4680,CCLXVII,Not before Aix will he not make sojourn;
4681,CCLXVII,"Canters so far, on th'terrace he dismounts."
4682,CCLXVII,"When he is come into his lofty house,"
4683,CCLXVII,By messengers he seeks his judges out;
4684,CCLXVII,"Saxons, Baivers, Lotherencs and Frisouns,"
4685,CCLXVII,"Germans he calls, and also calls Borgounds;"
4686,CCLXVII,"From Normandy, from Brittany and Poitou,"
4687,CCLXVII,And those in France that are the sagest found.
4688,CCLXVII,Thereon begins the cause of Gueneloun.

4690,CCLXVIII,CCLXVIII
4691,CCLXVIII,
4692,CCLXVIII,"That Emperour, returning out of Spain,"
4693,CCLXVIII,"Arrived in France, in his chief seat, at Aix,"
4694,CCLXVIII,"Clomb to th' Palace, into the hall he came."
4695,CCLXVIII,"Was come to him there Alde, that fair dame;"
4696,CCLXVIII,"Said to the King: ""Where's Rollanz the Captain,"
4697,CCLXVIII,"Who sware to me, he'ld have me for his mate?"""
4698,CCLXVIII,"Then upon Charles a heavy sorrow weighed,"
4699,CCLXVIII,"And his eyes wept, he tore his beard again:"
4700,CCLXVIII,"""Sister, dear friend, of a dead man you spake."
4701,CCLXVIII,"I'll give you one far better in exchange,"
4702,CCLXVIII,"That is Loewis, what further can I say;"
4703,CCLXVIII,"He is my son, and shall my marches take."""
4704,CCLXVIII,"Alde answered him: ""That word to me is strange."
4705,CCLXVIII,"Never, please God, His Angels and His Saints,"
4706,CCLXVIII,"When Rollant's dead shall I alive remain!"""
4707,CCLXVIII,"Her colour fails, at th' feet of Charlemain,"
4708,CCLXVIII,She falls; she's dead.  Her soul God's Mercy awaits!
4709,CCLXVIII,Barons of France weep therefore and complain.
4710,CCLXVIII,
4711,CCLXIX,CCLXIX
4712,CCLXIX,
4713,CCLXIX,Alde the fair is gone now to her rest.
4714,CCLXIX,"Yet the King thought she was but swooning then,"
4715,CCLXIX,"Pity he had, our Emperour, and wept,"
4716,CCLXIX,"Took her in's hands, raised her from th'earth again;"
4717,CCLXIX,On her shoulders her head still drooped and leant.
4718,CCLXIX,When Charles saw that she was truly dead
4719,CCLXIX,Four countesses at once he summoned;
4720,CCLXIX,"To a monast'ry of nuns they bare her thence,"
4721,CCLXIX,All night their watch until the dawn they held;
4722,CCLXIX,Before the altar her tomb was fashioned well;
4723,CCLXIX,Her memory the King with honour kept.

4731,CCLXX,"Those serfs have bound him, fast upon his stake,"
4732,CCLXX,"In deer-hide thongs his hands they've helpless made,"
4733,CCLXX,With clubs and whips they trounce him well and baste:

4744,CCLXXI,Thereon began the trial and defence

4763,CCLXXII,
4764,CCLXXIII,CCLXXIII
4765,CCLXXIII,
4766,CCLXXIII,"So Guenelun, before the King there, stood;"

4768,CCLXXIII,"Were he loyal, right baron-like he'd looked."
4769,CCLXXIII,"He saw those Franks, and all who'ld judge his doom,"
4770,CCLXXIII,And by his side his thirty kinsmen knew.
4771,CCLXXIII,"After, he cried aloud; his voice was full:"
4772,CCLXXIII,"""For th' Love of God, listen to me, baruns!"
4773,CCLXXIII,"I was in th' host, beside our Emperour,"
4774,CCLXXIII,Service I did him there in faith and truth.
4775,CCLXXIII,"Hatred of me had Rollant, his nephew;"
4776,CCLXXIII,So he decreed death for me and dolour.
4777,CCLXXIII,Message I bare to king Marsiliun;
4778,CCLXXIII,By my cunning I held myself secure.
4779,CCLXXIII,"To that fighter Rollant my challenge threw,"
4780,CCLXXIII,"To Oliver, and all their comrades too;"

4790,CCLXXIV,"'Tis Pinabel, who in Sorence castle liveth;"
4791,CCLXXIV,"Well can he speak, soundly his reasons giving,"
4792,CCLXXIV,"A good vassal, whose arm to fight is stiffened."
4793,CCLXXIV,"Says to him Guenes: ""In you my faith is fixed."
4794,CCLXXIV,"Save me this day from death, also from prison."""

4803,CCLXXV,"To th' counsel go those of Bavier and Saxe,"

4805,CCLXXV,Enough there are of Tudese and Germans.
4806,CCLXXV,"Those of Alverne the greatest court'sy have,"
4807,CCLXXV,From Pinabel most quietly draw back.
4808,CCLXXV,"Says each to each: ""'Twere well to let it stand."
4809,CCLXXV,"Leave we this cause, and of the King demand"
4810,CCLXXV,That he cry quits with Guenes for this act;
4811,CCLXXV,With love and faith he'll serve him after that.
4812,CCLXXV,"Since he is dead, no more ye'll see Rollanz,"
4813,CCLXXV,Nor any wealth nor gold may win him back.
4814,CCLXXV,"Most foolish then is he, would do combat."""
4815,CCLXXV,There is but one agrees not to their plan;

4838,CCLXXVII,"Lean were his limbs, and lengthy and delicate,"
4839,CCLXXVII,Black was his hair and somewhat brown his face;
4840,CCLXXVII,"Was not too small, and yet was hardly great;"
4841,CCLXXVII,And courteously to the Emperour he spake:
4842,CCLXXVII,"""Fair' Lord and King, do not yourself dismay!"
4843,CCLXXVII,You know that I have served you many ways:
4844,CCLXXVII,By my ancestors should I this cause maintain.
4845,CCLXXVII,And if Rollant was forfeited to Guenes

4847,CCLXXVII,"Felon is Guene, since th' hour that he betrayed,"
4848,CCLXXVII,"And, towards you, is perjured and ashamed:"
4849,CCLXXVII,"Wherefore I judge that he be hanged and slain,"
4850,CCLXXVII,"His carcass flung to th' dogs beside the way,"
4851,CCLXXVII,As a felon who felony did make.
4852,CCLXXVII,"But, has he a friend that would dispute my claim"
4853,CCLXXVII,With this my sword which I have girt in place

4936,CCLXXXIII,"Pure felon I, if e'er I that concede!"
4937,CCLXXXIII,"God shall this day the right shew, us between!"""

4941,CCLXXXIV,
4942,CCLXXXIV,"Then said Tierri ""Bold art thou, Pinabel,"
4943,CCLXXXIV,"Thou'rt great and strong, with body finely bred;"
4944,CCLXXXIV,For vassalage thy peers esteem thee well:
4945,CCLXXXIV,Of this battle let us now make an end!
4946,CCLXXXIV,With Charlemagne I soon will have thee friends;
4947,CCLXXXIV,To Guenelun such justice shall be dealt
4948,CCLXXXIV,"Day shall not dawn but men of it will tell."""
4949,CCLXXXIV,"""Please the Lord God, not so!"" said Pinabel."
4950,CCLXXXIV,"""I would sustain the cause of my kindred"
4951,CCLXXXIV,No mortal man is there from whom I've fled;
4952,CCLXXXIV,"Rather I'ld die than hear reproaches said."""
4953,CCLXXXIV,Then with their swords began to strike again
4954,CCLXXXIV,Upon those helms that were with gold begemmed
4955,CCLXXXIV,Into the sky the bright sparks rained and fell.
4956,CCLXXXIV,"It cannot be that they be sundered,"
4957,CCLXXXIV,"Nor make an end, without one man be dead."

4961,CCLXXXV,
4962,CCLXXXV,"He's very proof, Pinabel of Sorence,"
4963,CCLXXXV,"Tierri he strikes, on 's helmet of Provence,"
4964,CCLXXXV,"Leaps such a spark, the grass is kindled thence;"
4965,CCLXXXV,"Of his steel brand the point he then presents,"
4966,CCLXXXV,On Tierri's brow the helmet has he wrenched
4967,CCLXXXV,So down his face its broken halves descend;
4968,CCLXXXV,And his right cheek in flowing blood is drenched;
4969,CCLXXXV,"And his hauberk, over his belly, rent."
4970,CCLXXXV,"God's his warrant, Who death from him prevents."

4974,CCLXXXVI,
4975,CCLXXXVI,"Sees Tierris then 'that in the face he's struck,"
4976,CCLXXXVI,On grassy field runs clear his flowing blood;
4977,CCLXXXVI,"Strikes Pinabel on 's helmet brown and rough,"
4978,CCLXXXVI,"To the nose-piece he's broken it and cut,"
4979,CCLXXXVI,And from his head scatters his brains in th' dust;
4980,CCLXXXVI,"Brandishes him on th' sword, till dead he's flung."
4981,CCLXXXVI,Upon that blow is all the battle won.
4982,CCLXXXVI,"Franks cry aloud: ""God hath great virtue done."
4983,CCLXXXVI,It is proved right that Guenelun be hung.
4984,CCLXXXVI,"And those his kin, that in his cause are come."""

4989,CCLXXXVII,"Now that Tierris the battle fairly wins,"
4990,CCLXXXVII,That Emperour Charles is come to him;

4992,CCLXXXVII,"Naimes the Duke, Oger that Danish Prince,"
4993,CCLXXXVII,"Geifrei d'Anjou, Willalme of Blaive therewith."
4994,CCLXXXVII,"Tierri, the King takes in his arms to kiss;"
4995,CCLXXXVII,And wipes his face with his great marten-skins;
4996,CCLXXXVII,"He lays them down, and others then they bring;"
4997,CCLXXXVII,The chevaliers most sweetly disarm him;
4998,CCLXXXVII,"An Arab mule they've brought, whereon he sits."
4999,CCLXXXVII,With baronage and joy they bring him in.
5000,CCLXXXVII,"They come to Aix, halt and dismount therein."
5001,CCLXXXVII,The punishment of the others then begins.

5004,CCLXXXVIII,
5005,CCLXXXVIII,His counts and Dukes then calls to him Carlun:
5006,CCLXXXVIII,"""With these I guard, advise what shall be done."
5007,CCLXXXVIII,Hither they came because of Guenelun;
5008,CCLXXXVIII,"For Pinabel, as pledges gave them up."""
5009,CCLXXXVIII,"Answer the Franks: ""Shall not of them live one."""
5010,CCLXXXVIII,"The King commands his provost then, Basbrun:"
5011,CCLXXXVIII,"""Go hang them all on th' tree of cursed wood!"
5012,CCLXXXVIII,"Nay, by this beard, whose hairs are white enough,"
5013,CCLXXXVIII,"If one escape, to death and shame thou'rt struck!"""
5014,CCLXXXVIII,"He answers him: ""How could I act, save thus?"""
5015,CCLXXXVIII,With an hundred serjeants by force they come;
5016,CCLXXXVIII,"Thirty of them there are, that straight are hung."

5022,CCLXXXIX,Then turned away the Baivers and Germans
5023,CCLXXXIX,And Poitevins and Bretons and Normans.
5024,CCLXXXIX,"Fore all the rest, 'twas voted by the Franks"
5025,CCLXXXIX,That Guenes die with marvellous great pangs;
5026,CCLXXXIX,So to lead forth four stallions they bade;
5027,CCLXXXIX,"After, they bound his feet and both his hands;"
5028,CCLXXXIX,"Those steeds were swift, and of a temper mad;"
5029,CCLXXXIX,"Which, by their heads, led forward four sejeants"
5030,CCLXXXIX,Towards a stream that flowed amid that land.
5031,CCLXXXIX,Sones fell Gue into perdition black;
5032,CCLXXXIX,"All his sinews were strained until they snapped,"
5033,CCLXXXIX,And all the limbs were from his body dragged.
5034,CCLXXXIX,On the green grass his clear blood gushed and ran.
5035,CCLXXXIX,"Guenes is dead, a felon recreant."
