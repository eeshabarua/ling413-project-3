122,INTRODUCTION,
123,INTRODUCTION,
124,INTRODUCTION,The impersonal character of the Homeric poems has left us entirely in
125,INTRODUCTION,"the dark as to the birthplace, the history, and the date, of their"
126,INTRODUCTION,author. So complete is the darkness which surrounds the name of Homer
127,INTRODUCTION,"that his very existence has been disputed, and his works have been"
128,INTRODUCTION,"declared to be an ingenious compilation, drawn from the productions of"
129,INTRODUCTION,a multitude of singers. It is not my intention here to enter into the
130,INTRODUCTION,endless and barren controversy which has raged round this question. It
131,INTRODUCTION,will be more to the purpose to try and form some general idea of the
132,INTRODUCTION,characteristics of the Greek Epic; and to do this it is necessary to
133,INTRODUCTION,give a brief review of the political and social conditions in which it
134,INTRODUCTION,was produced.
135,INTRODUCTION,
136,I,I
137,I,
138,I,"The world as known to Homer is a mere fragment of territory, including"
139,I,"a good part of the mainland of Greece, with the islands and coast"
140,I,districts of the Ægæan. Outside of these limits his knowledge of
141,I,"geography is narrow indeed. He has heard of Sicily, which he speaks of"
142,I,"under the name of Thrinacia; and he speaks once of Libya, or the north"
143,I,"coast of Africa, as a district famous for its breed of sheep. There is"
144,I,one vague reference to the vast Scythian or Tartar race (called by
145,I,"Homer Thracians), who live on the milk of mares; and he mentions a"
146,I,"copper-coloured people, the ""Red-faces,"" who dwell far remote in the"
147,I,"east and west. The Nile is mentioned, under the name of Ægyptus; and"
148,I,the Egyptians are celebrated by the poet as a people skilled in
149,I,"medicine, a statement which is repeated by Herodotus. The Phoenicians"
150,I,"appear several times in the _Odyssey_, and we hear once or twice of"
151,I,"the Sidonians, as skilled workers in metal. As soon as we pass these"
152,I,"boundaries, we enter at once into the region of fairyland."
153,I,
154,II,II
155,II,
156,II,In speaking of the religion of the Homeric Greeks we have to draw a
157,II,distinction between the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_. In the _Iliad_ the
158,II,"gods play a much livelier and more human part than in the latter poem,"
159,II,and it is highly remarkable that the only comic scenes in the first
160,II,and greatest of epics are those in which the gods are the chief
161,II,actors--as when the lame Hephæstus takes upon him the office of
162,II,"cupbearer at the Olympian banquet, or when Artemis gets her ears boxed"
163,II,by the angry Hera. It would almost seem as if there were a vein of
164,II,"deliberate satire running through these descriptions, so daring is the"
165,II,treatment of the divine personages.
166,II,
167,II,"In the _Odyssey_, on the other hand, religion has become more"
168,II,"spiritual. Olympus is no longer the mountain of that name, but a vague"
169,II,"term, like our ""heaven,"" denoting a place remote from all earthly"
170,II,"cares and passions, a far-off abode in the stainless ether, where the"
171,II,"gods dwell in everlasting peace, and from which they occasionally"
172,II,"descend, to give an eye to the righteous and unrighteous deeds of men."
173,II,
174,II,In his conception of the state of the soul after death Homer is very
175,II,"interesting. His _Hades_, or place of departed spirits, is a dim,"
176,II,"shadowy region beyond the setting of the sun, where, after life's"
177,II,"trials are over, the souls of men keep up a faint and feeble being. It"
178,II,"is highly significant that the word which in Homer means ""self"" has"
179,II,"also the meaning of ""body""--showing how intimately the sense of"
180,II,personal identity was associated with the condition of bodily
181,II,"existence. The disembodied spirit is compared to a shadow, a dream, or"
182,II,"a waft of smoke. ""Alas!"" cries Achilles, after a visit from the ghost"
183,II,"of Patroclus, ""I perceive that even in the halls of Hades there is a"
184,II,"spirit and a phantom, but understanding none at all""; for the mental"
185,II,"condition of these cold, uncomfortable ghosts is as feeble as their"
186,II,bodily form is shadowy and unsubstantial. They hover about with a
187,II,"fitful motion, uttering thin, gibbering cries, like the voice of a"
188,II,"bat, and before they can obtain strength to converse with a visitor"
189,II,"from the other world, they have to be fortified by a draught of fresh"
190,II,"blood. The subject is summed up by Achilles, when Odysseus felicitates"
191,II,"him on the honour which he enjoys, even in Hades: ""Tell me not of"
192,II,"comfort in death,"" he says: ""I had rather be the thrall of the poorest"
193,II,"wight that ever tilled a thankless soil for bread, than rule as king"
194,II,"over all the shades of the departed."""
195,II,
196,III,III
197,III,
198,III,Homeric society is essentially aristocratic. At its head stands the
199,III,"king, who may be a great potentate, like Agamemnon, ruling over a wide"
200,III,"extent of territory, or a petty prince, like Odysseus, who exercises a"
201,III,sort of patriarchal authority within the limits of a small island. The
202,III,"person of the king is sacred, and his office is hereditary. He bears"
203,III,"the title of _Diogenes_, ""Jove-born,"" and is under the especial"
204,III,"protection of the supreme ruler of Olympus. He is leader in war, chief"
205,III,"judge, president of the council of elders, and representative of the"
206,III,state at the public sacrifices. The symbol of his office is the
207,III,"sceptre, which in some cases is handed down as an heirloom from father"
208,III,to son.
209,III,
210,III,"Next to the king stand the elders, a title which has no reference to"
211,III,"age, but merely denotes those of noble birth and breeding. The elders"
212,III,"form a senate, or deliberative body, before which all questions of"
213,III,public importance are laid by the king. Their decisions are afterwards
214,III,"communicated to the general assembly of the people, who signify their"
215,III,"approval or dissent by tumultuous cries, but have no power of altering"
216,III,or reversing the measures proposed by the nobles. Thus we have already
217,III,"the three main elements of political life: king, lords, and"
218,III,commons--though the position of the last is at present almost entirely
219,III,passive.
220,III,
221,IV,IV
222,IV,
223,IV,The morality of the Homeric age is such as we may expect to find among
224,IV,a people which has only partially emerged from barbarism. Crimes of
225,IV,"violence are very common, and a familiar figure in the society of this"
226,IV,"period is that of the fugitive, who ""has slain a man,"" and is flying"
227,IV,"from the vengeance of his family. Patroclus, when a mere boy, kills"
228,IV,his youthful playmate in a quarrel over a game of knucklebones--an
229,IV,incident which may be seen illustrated in one of the statues in the
230,IV,British Museum. One of the typical scenes of Hellenic life depicted on
231,IV,the shield of Achilles is a trial for homicide; and such cases were of
232,IV,so frequent occurrence that they afford materials for a simile in the
233,IV,last book of the _Iliad_.
234,IV,
235,IV,"Where life is held so cheap, opinion is not likely to be very strict"
236,IV,in matters of property. And we find accordingly a general acquiescence
237,IV,"in ""the good old rule, the ancient plan, that they may take who have"
238,IV,"the power, and they may keep who can."" Cattle-lifting is as common as"
239,IV,it formerly was on the Scottish border. The bold buccaneer is a
240,IV,character as familiar as in the good old days when Drake and Raleigh
241,IV,"singed the Spanish king's beard, with this important difference, that"
242,IV,the buccaneer of ancient Greece plundered Greek and barbarian with
243,IV,fine impartiality. A common question addressed to persons newly
244,IV,"arrived from the sea is, ""Are you a merchant, a traveller, or a"
245,IV,"pirate?"" And this curious query implies no reproach, and calls for no"
246,IV,"resentment. Still more startling are the terms in which Autolycus, the"
247,IV,"maternal grandfather of Odysseus, is spoken of. This worthy, we are"
248,IV,"informed, ""surpassed all mankind in thieving and lying""; and the"
249,IV,information is given in a manner which shows that the poet intended it
250,IV,as a grave compliment. In another passage the same hero is celebrated
251,IV,as an accomplished burglar. So low was the standard of Homeric ethics
252,IV,"in this respect; and even in the historical age of Greece, want of"
253,IV,honesty and want of truthfulness were too often conspicuous failings
254,IV,in some of her most famous men.
255,IV,
256,IV,Even more shocking to the moral sense is the wild ferocity which
257,IV,sometimes breaks out in the language and conduct of both men and
258,IV,women. The horrible practice of mutilating the dead after a battle is
259,IV,"viewed with indifference, and even with complacency, by the bravest"
260,IV,"warriors. Even Patroclus, the most amiable of the heroes in the"
261,IV,"_Iliad_, proposes to inflict this dastardly outrage on the body of the"
262,IV,fallen Sarpedon. Achilles drags the body of Hector behind his chariot
263,IV,"from the battlefield, and keeps it in his tent for many days, that he"
264,IV,may repeat this hideous form of vengeance in honour of his slaughtered
265,IV,friend. When the dying Hector begs him to restore his body to the
266,IV,"Trojans for burial he replies with savage taunts, and wishes that he"
267,IV,could find it in his heart to carve the flesh of Hector and eat it
268,IV,"raw! And Hecuba, the venerable Queen of Troy, expresses herself in"
269,IV,similar terms when Priam is preparing to set forth on his mission to
270,IV,the tent of Achilles.
271,IV,
272,IV,"Turning now to the more attractive side of the picture, we shall find"
273,IV,much to admire in the character of Homer's heroes. In the first place
274,IV,"we have to note their intense vitality and keen sense of pleasure,"
275,IV,natural to a young and vigorous people. The outlook on life is
276,IV,"generally bright and cheerful, and there is hardly any trace of that"
277,IV,corroding pessimism which meets us in later literature. Cases of
278,IV,"suicide, so common in the tragedians, are almost unknown."
279,IV,
280,IV,"In one respect, and that too a point of the very highest importance,"
281,IV,the Greeks of this age were far in advance of those who came after
282,IV,"them, and not behind the most polished nations of modern Europe. We"
283,IV,"refer to the beauty, the tenderness, and the purity of their domestic"
284,IV,relations. The whole story of the _Odyssey_ is founded on the faithful
285,IV,"wedded love of Odysseus and Penelope, and the contrasted example of"
286,IV,Agamemnon and his demon wife is repeatedly held up to scorn and
287,IV,abhorrence. The world's poetry affords no nobler scene than the
288,IV,"parting of Hector and Andromache in the _Iliad_, nor has the ideal of"
289,IV,perfect marriage ever found grander expression than in the words
290,IV,"addressed by Odysseus to Nausicaä: ""There is nothing mightier and"
291,IV,"nobler than when man and wife are of one mind and heart in a house, a"
292,IV,"grief to their foes, and to their friends a great joy, but their own"
293,IV,"hearts know it best.""[1]"
294,IV,
295,IV,[Footnote 1: Butcher and Lang's translation.]
296,IV,
297,IV,"Hospitality in a primitive state of society, where inns are unknown,"
298,IV,is not so much a virtue as a necessity. Even in these early times the
299,IV,"Greeks, within the limits of their little world, were great"
300,IV,"travellers, and their swift chariots, and galleys propelled by sail"
301,IV,"and oar, enabled them to make considerable journeys with speed and"
302,IV,safety. Arrived at their destination for the night they were sure of a
303,IV,warm welcome at the first house at which they presented themselves;
304,IV,and he who played the host on one occasion expected and found a like
305,IV,"return when, perhaps years afterwards, he was brought by business or"
306,IV,pleasure to the home of his former guest. Nor were these privileges
307,IV,"confined to the wealthy and noble, who were able, when the time came,"
308,IV,"to make payment in kind, but the poorest and most helpless outcast,"
309,IV,"the beggar, the fugitive, and the exile, found countenance and"
310,IV,"protection, when he made his plea in the name of Zeus, the god of"
311,IV,hospitality.
312,IV,
313,V,V
314,V,
315,V,This frankness and simplicity of manners runs through the whole life
316,V,"of the Homeric Greek, and is reflected in every page of the two great"
317,V,epics which are the lasting monuments of that bright and happy age. As
318,V,"civilisation advances, and life becomes more complicated and"
319,V,"artificial, human activity tends more and more to split up into an"
320,V,"infinite number of minute occupations, and the whole time and energy"
321,V,of each individual are not more than sufficient to make him master in
322,V,"some little corner of art, science, or industry. A vast system of"
323,V,commerce brings the products of the whole world to our doors; and it
324,V,is almost appalling to think of the millions of toiling hands and busy
325,V,"brains which must pass all their days in unceasing toil, in order that"
326,V,the humblest citizen may find his daily wants supplied. To give only
327,V,one example: how vast and tremendous is the machinery which must be
328,V,set at work before a single letter or post-card can reach its
329,V,"destination! This multiplication of needs, and endless subdivision of"
330,V,"labour, too often results in stunting and crippling the development of"
331,V,"the individual, so that it becomes harder, as time advances, to find a"
332,V,"complete man, with all his faculties matured by equable and harmonious"
333,V,growth.
334,V,
335,V,Very different were the conditions of life in the Homeric age. Then
336,V,"the wealthy man's house was a little world in itself, capable of"
337,V,supplying all the simple wants of its inhabitants. The women spun wool
338,V,"and flax, the produce of the estate, and wove them into cloth and"
339,V,"linen, to be dyed and wrought into garments by the same skilful hands."
340,V,On the sunny slopes of the hills within sight of the doors the grapes
341,V,"were ripening against the happy time of vintage, when merry troops of"
342,V,children would bring them home with dance and song to be trodden in
343,V,"the winepress. Nearer at hand was the well-kept orchard, bowing under"
344,V,"its burden of apples, pears, and figs; and groves of grey olive-trees"
345,V,promised abundance of oil. In the valleys waved rich harvests of wheat
346,V,"and barley, which were reaped, threshed, ground, and made into bread,"
347,V,"by the master's thralls. Herds of oxen, and flocks of sheep and goats,"
348,V,"roved on the broad upland pastures, and in the forest multitudes of"
349,V,swine were fattening on the beech-mast and acorns.
350,V,
351,V,"And the owner of all these blessings was no luxurious drone, living in"
352,V,"idleness on the labour of other men's hands. He was, in the fullest"
353,V,"sense of the word, the father of his household. His was the vigilant"
354,V,eye which watched and directed every member in the little army of
355,V,"workers, and his the generous hand which dealt out bountiful reward"
356,V,for faithful service. If need were he could take his share in the
357,V,"hardest field labour, and plough a straight furrow, or mow a heavy"
358,V,crop of grass from dawn till sunset without breaking his fast. Nothing
359,V,"was too great or too little to engage his attention, as the necessity"
360,V,"arose. He was a warrior, whose single prowess might go far in deciding"
361,V,"the issue of a hard-fought battle--an orator, discoursing with weighty"
362,V,"eloquence on grave questions of state--a judge, whose decisions helped"
363,V,to build up the as yet unwritten code of law. Descending from these
364,V,"high altitudes, he could take up his bow and spear, and go forth to"
365,V,"hunt the boar and the stag, or wield the woodman's axe, or the"
366,V,"carpenter's saw and chisel. He could kill, dress, and serve his own"
367,V,"dinner; and when the strenuous day was over, he could tune the harp,"
368,V,"discourse sweet music, and sing of the deeds of heroes and gods."
369,V,
370,V,"Such was the versatility, and such the many-sided energy, of the Greek"
371,V,as he appears in the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_. And as these two poems
372,V,contain the elements of all subsequent thought and progress in the
373,V,"Greek nation, so in the typical character of Odysseus are concentrated"
374,V,all the qualities which distinguish the individual Greek--his
375,V,"insatiable curiosity, which left no field of thought unexplored--his"
376,V,"spirit of daring enterprise, which carried the banner of civilisation"
377,V,to the borders of India and the Straits of Gibraltar--and his subtlety
378,V,"and craft, which in a later age made him a byword to the grave"
379,V,moralists of Rome.
380,V,
381,V,In the _Iliad_ Odysseus is constantly exhibited as a contrast to the
382,V,"youthful Achilles. Wherever prudence, experience, and policy, are"
383,V,"required, Odysseus comes to the front. In Achilles, with his furious"
384,V,"passions and ill-regulated impulses, there is always something of the"
385,V,barbarian; while Odysseus in all his actions obeys the voice of
386,V,"reason. It will readily be seen that such a character, essentially"
387,V,"intellectual, always moving within due measure, never breaking out"
388,V,"into eccentricity or excess, would appeal less to the popular"
389,V,"imagination than the fiery nature of Pelides, ""strenuous, passionate,"
390,V,"implacable, and fierce."" And on this ground we may partly explain the"
391,V,unamiable light in which Odysseus appears in later Greek literature.
392,V,Already in Pindar we find him singled out for disapproval. In
393,V,Sophocles he has sunk still lower; and in Euripides his degradation is
394,V,completed.
395,V,
396,VI,VI
397,VI,
398,VI,Space does not allow us to give a detailed criticism of the _Odyssey_

405,VI,begin to miss that high and equable sublimity which never flags or
406,VI,"sinks, that continuous current of moving incidents, those rapid"
407,VI,"transitions, that force of eloquence, that opulence of imagery which"
408,VI,is ever true to nature. Like the sea when it retires upon itself and

428,I,
429,I,"In a high, level spot, commanding a view of the sea, stands the house"
430,I,"of Odysseus, the mightiest prince in Ithaca. It is a spacious"
431,I,"building, two storeys high, constructed entirely of wood, and"
432,I,surrounded on all sides by a strong wooden fence. Within the
433,I,"enclosure, and in front of the house, is a wide courtyard, containing"
434,I,"the stables, and other offices of the household."
435,I,
436,I,"A proud maiden was Penelope, when Odysseus wedded her in her youthful"
437,I,"bloom, and made her the mistress of his fair dwelling and his rich"
438,I,"domain. One happy year they lived together, and a son was born to"
439,I,"them, whom they named Telemachus. Then war arose between Greece and"
440,I,"Asia, and Odysseus was summoned to join the train of chieftains who"
441,I,"followed Agamemnon to win back Helen, his brother's wife. Ten years"
442,I,"the war lasted; then Troy was taken, and those who had survived the"
443,I,"struggle returned to their homes. Among these was Odysseus, who set"
444,I,"sail with joyful heart, hoping, before many days were passed, to take"
445,I,up anew the thread of domestic happiness which had been so rudely
446,I,"broken. But since that hour he has vanished from sight, and for ten"
447,I,long years from the fall of Troy the house has been mourning its
448,I,absent lord.
449,I,
450,I,"During the last three years a new trouble has been present, to fill"
451,I,"the cup of Penelope's sorrow to the brim. A host of suitors, drawn"
452,I,from the most powerful families in Ithaca and the neighbouring
453,I,"islands, have beset the house of Odysseus, desiring to wed his wife"
454,I,and possess her wealth. All her friends urge her to make choice of a
455,I,husband from that clamorous band; for no one now believes that there
456,I,is any hope left of Odysseus' return. Only Penelope still clings to
457,I,"the belief that he is yet living, and will one day come home. So for"
458,I,three years she has put them off by a cunning trick. She began to
459,I,"weave a shroud for her father-in-law, Laertes, promising that, as soon"
460,I,"as the garment was finished, she would wed one of the suitors. Then"
461,I,all day long she wove that choice web; and every night she undid the
462,I,"work of the day, unravelling the threads which she had woven. So for"
463,I,"three years she beguiled the suitors, but at last she was betrayed by"
464,I,"her handmaids, and the fraud was discovered. The princes upbraided her"
465,I,"loudly for her deceit, and became more importunate than ever. The"
466,I,substance of Odysseus was wasting away; for day after day the wooers
467,I,"came thronging to the house, a hundred strong, and feasted at the"
468,I,"expense of its absent master, and drank up his wine."
469,I,
470,I,"No hope seems left to the heartbroken, faithful wife. Even her son has"
471,I,"grown impatient at the waste of his goods, and urges her to make the"
472,I,"hard choice, and the hateful hour is at hand which will part her for"
473,I,ever from the scene of her brief wedded joy.

475,I,[Illustration: Penelope]
476,I,
477,II,II
478,II,
479,II,"It was the hour of noon, and the sun was beating hot on the rocky"
480,II,"hills of Ithaca, when a solitary wayfarer was seen approaching the"
481,II,outer gateway which led into the courtyard of Odysseus' house. He was
482,II,"a man of middle age, dressed like a chieftain, and carrying a long"
483,II,spear in his hand. Passing through the covered gateway he halted
484,II,"abruptly, and gazed in astonishment at the strange sight which met his"
485,II,"eyes. All was noise and bustle in the courtyard, where a busy troop of"
486,II,servants were preparing the materials for a great feast. Some were
487,II,"carrying smoking joints of roast meat, others were filling huge bowls"
488,II,"with wine and water, and others were washing the tables and setting"
489,II,them out to dry. In the portico before the house sat a great company
490,II,"of young nobles, comely of aspect, and daintily attired, taking their"
491,II,"ease on couches of raw ox-hide, and playing at draughts to while away"
492,II,"the time until the banquet should be ready. Loud was their talk, and"
493,II,"boisterous their laughter, as of men who have no respect for"
494,II,"themselves or for others. ""Surely this was the house of Odysseus,"""
495,II,"murmured the stranger to himself, ""but now it seems like a den of"
496,II,"thieves. But who is that tall and goodly lad, who sits apart, with"
497,II,"gloomy brow, and seems ill-pleased with the doings of that riotous"
498,II,"crew? Surely I should know that face, the very face of my old friend"
499,II,"as I knew him long years ago."""
500,II,
501,II,"As he spoke, the youth who had attracted his notice glanced in his"
502,II,"direction, and seeing a stranger standing unheeded at the entrance, he"
503,II,rose from his seat and came with hasty step and heightened colour
504,II,"towards him. ""Forgive me, friend,"" he said, with hand outstretched in"
505,II,"welcome, ""that I marked thee not before. My thoughts were far away."
506,II,"But come into the house, and sit down to meat, and when thou hast"
507,II,"eaten we will inquire the reason of thy coming."""
508,II,
509,II,"So saying, and taking the stranger's spear, he led him into the great"
510,II,"hall of the house, and sat down with him in a corner, remote from the"
511,II,"noise of the revel. And a handmaid bare water in a golden ewer, and"
512,II,poured it over their hands into a basin of silver; and when they had
513,II,"washed, a table was set before them, heaped with delicate fare. Then"
514,II,"host and guest took their meal together, and comforted their hearts"
515,II,with wine.
516,II,
517,II,"Before they had finished, the whole company came trooping in from the"
518,II,"courtyard, and filled the room with uproar, calling aloud for food and"
519,II,"drink. Not a chair was left empty, and the servants hurried to and"
520,II,"fro, supplying the wants of these unwelcome visitors. Vast quantities"
521,II,"of flesh were consumed, and many a stout jar of wine was drained to"
522,II,"the dregs, to supply the wants of that greedy multitude."
523,II,
524,II,"When at last their hunger was appeased, and every goblet stood empty,"
525,II,"Phemius, the minstrel, stood up in their midst, and after striking a"
526,II,"few chords on his harp, began to sing a famous lay. Then the youth who"
527,II,"had been entertaining the stranger drew closer his chair, and thus"
528,II,"addressed him, speaking low in his ear: ""Thou seest what fair company"
529,II,"we keep, how wanton they are, and how gay. Yet there was once a man"
530,II,"who would have driven them, like beaten hounds, from this hall, even"
531,II,he whose substance they are devouring. But his bones lie whitening at
532,II,"the bottom of the sea, and we who are left must tamely suffer this"
533,II,"wrong. But now thou hast eaten, and I may question thee without"
534,II,"reproach. Say, therefore, who art thou, and where is thy home? Comest"
535,II,"thou for the first time to Ithaca, or art thou an old friend of this"
536,II,"house, bound to us by ties of ancient hospitality?"""
537,II,
538,II,"""My name is Mentes,"" answered the stranger, ""and I am a prince of the"
539,II,"Taphians, a bold race of sailors. I am a friend of this house, well"
540,II,"known to its master, Odysseus, and his father, Laertes. Be of good"
541,II,"cheer, for he whom thou mournest is not dead, nor shall his coming be"
542,II,"much longer delayed. But tell me now of a truth, art not thou the son"
543,II,"of that man? I knew him well, and thou hast the very face and eyes of"
544,II,"Odysseus."""
545,II,
546,II,"""My mother calls me his son,"" replied the youth, who was indeed"
547,II,"Telemachus himself, ""and I am bound to believe her. Would that it were"
548,II,"otherwise! I have little cause to bless my birth."""
549,II,
550,II,"""Yet shalt thou surely be blest,"" said Mentes; ""thou art not unmarked"
551,II,"of the eye of Heaven. But answer me once more, what means this lawless"
552,II,"riot in the house? And what cause has brought all these men hither?"""
553,II,
554,II,"""This also thou shalt know,"" replied Telemachus. ""These are the"
555,II,princes who have come to woo my mother; and while she keeps them
556,II,"waiting for her answer they eat up my father's goods. Ere long,"
557,II,"methinks, they will make an end of me also."""
558,II,
559,II,"""Fit wooers indeed for the wife of such a man!"" said Mentes with a"
560,II,"bitter smile. ""Would that he were standing among them now as I saw him"
561,II,"once in my father's house, armed with helmet and shield and spear! He"
562,II,would soon wed them to another bride. But whether it be God's will
563,II,"that he return or not, 'tis for thee to devise means to drive these"
564,II,"men from thy house. Take heed, therefore, to my words, and do as I bid"
565,II,thee. To-morrow thou shalt summon the suitors to the place of
566,II,"assembly, and charge them that they depart to their homes. And do thou"
567,II,"thyself fit out a ship, with twenty rowers, and get thee to Pylos,"
568,II,"where the aged Nestor dwells, and inquire of him concerning thy"
569,II,"father. From Pylos proceed to Sparta, the kingdom of Menelaus; he was"
570,II,"the last of the Greeks to reach home, after the fall of Troy; and"
571,II,perchance thou mayest learn something from him. And if thou hearest
572,II,"sure tidings of thy father's death, then get thee home, and raise a"
573,II,"tomb to his memory, and keep his funeral feast. Then let thy mother"
574,II,"wed whom she will; and if these men still beset thee, thou must devise"
575,II,"means to slay them, either by guile or openly. Thou art now a man, and"
576,II,must play a man's part. Hast thou not heard of the fame which Orestes
577,II,"won, when he slew the murderer of his sire? Be thou valiant, even as"
578,II,"he; tall thou art, and fair, and shouldst be a stout man of thy hands."
579,II,"But 'tis time for me to be going; my ship awaits me in the harbour,"
580,II,"and my comrades will be tired of waiting for me."""
581,II,
582,II,"""Stay yet awhile,"" answered Telemachus, ""until thou hast refreshed"
583,II,thyself with the bath; and I will give thee a costly gift to bear with
584,II,"thee as a memorial of thy visit."" But even as he spoke Mentes rose"
585,II,"from his seat and, gliding like a shadow through the sunlit doorway,"
586,II,"disappeared. Telemachus followed, in wonder and displeasure; but no"
587,II,trace of the strange visitor was to be seen. Looking upward he saw a
588,II,great sea-eagle winging his way towards the shore; and a voice seemed
589,II,"to whisper in his ear: ""No mortal was thy guest, but the great goddess"
590,II,"Athene, daughter of Zeus, and ever thy father's true comrade and"
591,II,"faithful ally."""
592,II,
593,III,III
594,III,
595,III,"With a strange elation of spirits Telemachus returned to the hall, and"
596,III,sat down among the suitors. Hitherto he had shown a certain weakness
597,III,"and indecision of character, natural in a young lad, who had grown up"
598,III,"without the strong guiding hand of a father, and who, since the first"
599,III,"dawn of his manhood, had been surrounded by a host of subtle foes. But"
600,III,"the words of Athene have gone home, and he resolves that from this"
601,III,hour he will take his proper place in the house as his mother's
602,III,guardian and the heir of a great prince.
603,III,
604,III,"There was an unwonted stillness among that lawless troop, and they sat"
605,III,"silent and attentive in the great, dimly lighted chamber. For the"
606,III,"minstrel was singing a sweet and solemn strain, which told of the"
607,III,"home-coming of the Greeks from Troy, and of all the disasters which"
608,III,befell them on the way. Suddenly the singer paused in the midst of his
609,III,"lay, for his fine ear had caught the sound of a sobbing sigh. Looking"
610,III,"round, he saw a tall and stately lady standing in the doorway which"
611,III,led to the women's apartments at the back of the house. She was
612,III,"closely veiled, but he instantly recognised the form of Penelope, his"
613,III,beloved mistress.
614,III,
615,III,"""Phemius,"" said Penelope, in a tone of gentle reproach, ""hast thou no"
616,III,"other lay to sing, but must needs recite this tale of woe, which fills"
617,III,"my soul with tears, by calling up the image of him for whom I sorrow"
618,III,"night and day?"""
619,III,
620,III,"Phemius stood abashed, and ventured no reply; but Telemachus answered"
621,III,"for him. ""Mother,"" he said, ""blame not the sweet minstrel for his"
622,III,"song. The bard is not the author of the woes of which he sings, but"
623,III,Zeus assigns to each his portion of good and ill; and thou must submit
624,III,"to his ordinance, like many another lady who has lost her lord. Thou"
625,III,"hast thy province in the house, and I mine; thine is to govern thy"
626,III,"handmaids, and mine to take the lead where the men are gathered"
627,III,"together. And I say that the minstrel has chosen well."""
628,III,
629,III,There was a new note of command in the voice of Telemachus as he
630,III,"uttered these words. Penelope heard it, and wondered what change had"
631,III,come over her son; but a hundred bold eyes were gazing insolently at
632,III,"her, and without another word she turned away, and ascended the steep"
633,III,"stairs which led to her bower. There she reclined on a couch, and her"
634,III,tears flowed freely; for the song of Phemius had reopened the fountain
635,III,"of her grief. Presently the sound of sobbing died away, and she drew"
636,III,her breath gently in a sweet and placid sleep.
637,III,
638,III,"The sudden appearance of Penelope had excited the suitors, and they"
639,III,began to brawl noisily among themselves. Presently Telemachus raised
640,III,"his voice, commanding silence for the minstrel. ""And I have something"
641,III,"else to say unto you,"" he added. ""To-morrow at dawn I bid you come to"
642,III,"the place of assembly, that we may make an end of these wild doings in"
643,III,"my house. I will bear it no longer, but will publish your evil deeds"
644,III,"to the ears of gods and men."""
645,III,
646,III,"Among the suitors there was a certain Antinous, a tall and stout"
647,III,"fellow, of commanding presence, who was looked up to by the others as"
648,III,"a sort of leader, being the boldest and most brutal in the band. And"
649,III,"now he answered for the rest ""Heaven speed thy boasting, young"
650,III,"braggart!"" he cried in rude and jeering tones. ""It will be a happy day"
651,III,"for the men of Ithaca when they have thee for their king."""
652,III,
653,III,"""I claim not the kingdom,"" answered Telemachus firmly, ""but I am"
654,III,"resolved to be master in my own house."""
655,III,
656,III,"By the side of Antinous sat Eurymachus, who was next to him in power"
657,III,"and rank. This was a smooth and subtle villain, not less dangerous"
658,III,"than Antinous, but glib and plausible of speech. And he too made"
659,III,"answer after his kind: ""Telemachus, thou sayest well, and none can"
660,III,dispute thy right. But with thy good leave I would ask thee concerning
661,III,the stranger. He seemed a goodly man; but why did he start up and
662,III,"leave us so suddenly? Did he bring any tidings of thy father?"""
663,III,
664,III,"""There can be no tidings of him,"" answered Telemachus sadly, ""except"
665,III,"that we shall never see him again. And as to this stranger, it was"
666,III,"Mentes, a friend of my father's, and prince of the Taphians."""
667,III,
668,III,"Night was now coming on, the suitors departed to their homes, and"
669,III,"Telemachus, who meditated an early start next day, retired early to"
670,III,"his chamber. The room where he slept stood in the courtyard, apart"
671,III,"from the house, and was reached by a stairway. He was attended by an"
672,III,"aged dame, Eurycleia, who had nursed him in his infancy. And all night"
673,III,"long he lay sleepless, pondering on the perils and the adventures"
674,III,which awaited him.
675,III,
676,III,
677,III,
678,III,
679,III,The Assembly; The Voyage of Telemachus
680,III,
681,III,
682,I,I
683,I,
684,I,"At the first peep of dawn Telemachus was afoot, and summoning the"
685,I,heralds he ordered them to make proclamation of an assembly to be held
686,I,in a public place in the town of Ithaca. Then he went down to the
687,I,"place of assembly, with two favourite hounds following close at his"
688,I,heels; and when he arrived he found the princes and elders of the
689,I,people already gathered together. All eyes were turned to the gallant
690,I,"lad, as he sat down on his father's seat among the noblest of the sons"
691,I,"of Ithaca. Never had he worn so princely an air, or seemed so worthy"
692,I,of his mighty sire.
693,I,
694,I,Then the old chieftain Ægyptus began the debate; he was bent double
695,I,"with age, and one of his sons, Antiphus, had followed Odysseus to"
696,I,"Troy, while another, Eurynomus, was among the suitors of Penelope. It"
697,I,"was of Antiphus that he thought, as he stood up and made harangue"
698,I,among the elders:
699,I,
700,I,"""Who has summoned us hither, and what is his need? Never have we met"
701,I,together in council since the day when Odysseus set sail from Ithaca.
702,I,"Hath any tidings come of the return of those who followed him to Troy,"
703,I,or is it some other business of public moment which has called us
704,I,"hither? But whoever sent out this summons, I doubt not he is a worthy"
705,I,"man, and may Zeus accomplish his purpose, whatever it be."""
706,I,
707,I,"Such chance sayings were regarded as a sign of Heaven's will, and"
708,I,Telemachus rejoiced in spirit at the old man's blessing. And forthwith
709,I,"he stood up in the midst, and, taking the sceptre from the herald's"
710,I,"hand, rushed at once into the subject of which his mind was full."
711,I,
712,I,"""Behold me here, old man,"" he said, addressing Ægyptus. ""It is I who"
713,I,"have called you together, and surely not without a cause. Is it not"
714,I,"enough that I have lost my brave father, whose gentleness and"
715,I,"loving-kindness ye all knew, when he was your king? But must I sit"
716,I,"still, day after day, and see the fattest of my flocks and herds"
717,I,"slaughtered, and the red wine poured out wastefully, by these men who"
718,I,"have come to woo my mother? Take shame to yourselves, and restrain"
719,I,"them; fear the reproach of men, and the wrath of Heaven, and suffer me"
720,I,"not thus to be evilly entreated, unless ye harbour revengeful thoughts"
721,I,"against my father, for some wrong which he has done you."""
722,I,
723,I,"He had spoken thus far, when tears choked his voice, and flinging the"
724,I,sceptre on the ground he returned to his seat. There was a general
725,I,"feeling of compassion among his hearers, and not one of the suitors"
726,I,"ventured to answer him, save only Antinous, who began in his wonted"
727,I,"style of brutal insolence, upbraiding Telemachus in violent terms, and"
728,I,"throwing all the blame on Penelope, who, he said, had beguiled them"
729,I,for three years by holding out promises which she never meant to
730,I,"fulfil. Then he told the story of Penelope's web, and concluded his"
731,I,speech with these words:
732,I,
733,I,"""As long as thy mother continues in this mind, so long will we stay"
734,I,"here and consume thy living. If thou wouldst be quit of us, send her"
735,I,"to her father's house and bid her marry the man of her choice."""
736,I,
737,I,"Telemachus replied: ""How can I drive away the mother who bare me and"
738,I,nourished me? And where shall I find means to pay back her dower? But
739,I,"most of all I dread my mother's curse. No, never shall that word be"
740,I,"spoken by me. Therefore, if ye know aught of fair and honest dealing,"
741,I,"depart from my house, and live on your own goods; but if it seems good"
742,I,"to you to eat up another man's living, then will I appeal to the"
743,I,"justice of heaven, and pray for vengeance on your heads."""
744,I,
745,I,"""Behold, his prayer is answered,"" cried Halitherses, a venerable"
746,I,"elder, with snow-white beard, who was skilled in augury; and looking"
747,I,up they saw two eagles winging their way at full speed towards the
748,I,place of assembly. Now the two great birds hovered over the meeting;
749,I,and just at this moment they wheeled round and attacked each other
750,I,fiercely with beak and claw. After fighting for some time they shot
751,I,away to the right and were soon lost to view. Then Halitherses spake
752,I,"again, interpreting the omen: ""Hearken, men of Ithaca, to my words,"
753,I,"and to you, the suitors of Penelope, especially do I speak. Woe is"
754,I,coming upon you; I see it rising and swelling as a wave. Not long
755,I,"shall Odysseus be absent, but even now he is near at hand hatching"
756,I,"mischief for those who sit here. And many another shall suffer,"
757,I,"besides these who have done the wrong. Therefore, I say, let us stop"
758,I,"their evil deeds, or let them cease themselves. The hour is near at"
759,I,"hand which I foretold, when Odysseus embarked for Troy: I said that"
760,I,"after many sufferings, having lost all his comrades, unknown to all in"
761,I,the twentieth year he should come home. And now all these things are
762,I,"coming to pass."""
763,I,
764,I,"Then up rose Eurymachus, in an angry and scornful mood. ""Old man,"""
765,I,"said he, ""go home and prophesy to thine own children, lest some harm"
766,I,befall thee here. Thinkest thou that every fowl of the air is a
767,I,"messenger from heaven? Odysseus has perished, and would that thou"
768,I,hadst perished with him! Art thou not ashamed to take sides with this
769,I,"malapert boy, feeding his passion and folly with thy crazy prophecies?"
770,I,"Doubtless thou lookest to him for favour and reward, but thou wilt"
771,I,find that his friendship will cost thee dear. Telemachus has heard our
772,I,answer to his complaint; let him keep his eloquence for his froward
773,I,"mother, and bring her to a better mind, for neither his speeches nor"
774,I,"thy prophecies will turn us from our purpose."""
775,I,
776,I,The principal object of the meeting was now attained: the villainy of
777,I,"the suitors had been publicly exposed, and they were left without"
778,I,excuse or hope of mercy when the day of reckoning should arrive.
779,I,"Accordingly Telemachus, dismissing the subject of his wrongs, now"
780,I,"spoke of his intended voyage to Pylos and Sparta, and begged for the"
781,I,loan of a ship to carry him and his comrades to the mainland.
782,I,
783,I,No response was made to his request; but one man still attempted to
784,I,"rouse public opinion against the suitors. This was Mentor, an old"
785,I,"friend of Odysseus, who had been left in charge of his household on"
786,I,"his departure from Ithaca. ""Is there not one among you,"" he cried"
787,I,"indignantly, ""who will speak a word for Telemachus, or testify against"
788,I,the wickedness of these men? No more let kings be gentle and merciful
789,I,"towards their people, as was Odysseus when he ruled over you, loving"
790,I,and tender-hearted as a father. Let righteousness give place to
791,I,"oppression, if these are its rewards. There you sit, like cowed and"
792,I,"beaten men, and suffer a handful of worthless men to lord it over you"
793,I,"all."""
794,I,
795,I,"After this last appeal, which was as fruitless as the others, the"
796,I,"meeting broke up, and the suitors returned to their revels in the"
797,I,house of Odysseus.
798,I,
799,II,II
800,II,
801,II,"Full of anxious thought, Telemachus went down to the shore, wondering"
802,II,"how he should find means to accomplish his voyage. Stooping down, he"
803,II,"bathed his hands in the sea, and after this act of purification he"
804,II,"lifted up his hands and prayed to Athene: ""O thou who camest yesterday"
805,II,"to our house, and badest me go on this quest, give ear and help me in"
806,II,"this strait."""
807,II,
808,II,"He had hardly finished his prayer when he heard a footstep, and"
809,II,"looking round saw Mentor, who had come to his aid at the meeting,"
810,II,"approaching from the town. ""Be not cast down,"" said Mentor, ""remember"
811,II,"whose son thou art, and all shall be well with thee. As to this"
812,II,"voyage, that shall be my care. I will find thee a ship, and will go"
813,II,with thee to Pylos. Meanwhile go thou home and make ready all things
814,II,"for victualling the ship, corn and wine and barley-meal, and bestow"
815,II,them heedfully in vessels and in bags of leather. Ships there are in
816,II,"plenty, new and old, in seagirt Ithaca; I will choose the best of them"
817,II,"all, and man her with a crew who will serve thee freely and with all"
818,II,"goodwill."""
819,II,
820,II,"Away went Telemachus, much comforted in spirit, though his heart"
821,II,fluttered when he thought of the great adventure which lay before him.
822,II,When he entered the courtyard of his house he found the suitors
823,II,flaying goats and singeing swine for the midday feast. Antinous hailed
824,II,"his coming with a rude laugh, and running up to him seized his hand"
825,II,"and said mockingly: ""Well met, Sir Eloquence! Thy face, I see, is full"
826,II,"of care, as of one who is bent on high designs. But lay thy graver"
827,II,"burdens aside for awhile, and eat and drink with us. Thou shalt want"
828,II,"neither ship nor men to carry thee to holy Pylos."""
829,II,
830,II,"Telemachus snatched his hand away, and answered sternly: ""My thoughts"
831,II,"are not of feasting and merry-making, nor would I eat and drink with"
832,II,"you if they were. I am no longer a child, to be flouted and robbed"
833,II,without a word. I tell you I shall find it in my heart to do you a
834,II,"mischief, before many days are passed. But now I am going, as I said,"
835,II,"on this journey. I must go as a passenger, since ye will not lend me a"
836,II,"ship."""
837,II,
838,II,"Many a scornful face was turned upon him, and many a taunt aimed at"
839,II,"him, as he uttered these bold words. ""We are all undone!"" cried one in"
840,II,"pretended alarm, ""Telemachus is gone to gather an army in Pylos or in"
841,II,"Sparta, and he will come back with his mighty men and take all our"
842,II,"lives."" ""Or perhaps he is going to bring poison from Ephyra,"" said"
843,II,"another, ""and he will cast it in the bowl, and we shall be all dead"
844,II,"corpses.[1]"" And a third cried: ""Take care of thyself, Telemachus, or"
845,II,"we shall have double labour because of thee, in dividing thy goods"
846,II,"among us."""
847,II,
848,II,[Footnote 1: 2 Kings xix. 35.]
849,II,
850,II,But the taunts of fools and knaves have no sting for honest ears.
851,II,"Without another word Telemachus left that gibing mob, and went"
852,II,straight to the strong-room where his father's treasure was stored.
853,II,"There lay heaps of gold and silver, and chests full of fine raiment,"
854,II,and great jars of fragrant olive-oil. Along the wall was a long row of
855,II,"portly casks, filled with the choicest wine; there they had stood"
856,II,"untouched for twenty years, awaiting the master's return. All this"
857,II,"wealth was given in charge to Eurycleia, the nurse of Telemachus, a"
858,II,"wise and careful dame, who watched the chamber day and night. Her"
859,II,"Telemachus now summoned, and said: ""Fill me twelve jars of wine--not"
860,II,"the best, which thou art keeping for my father, but the next best to"
861,II,"that. And take twenty measures of barley-meal, and store it in sacks"
862,II,"of leather, and keep all these things together till I send for them."
863,II,"Keep close counsel, and above all let not my mother know. I am going"
864,II,to Sparta and to sandy Pylos to inquire of my father's return; and I
865,II,"shall start in the evening when my mother is gone to rest."""
866,II,
867,II,"""Who put such a thought into thy heart?"" cried Eurycleia in wailing"
868,II,"tones. ""Why wilt thou take this dreadful journey, thou, an only child,"
869,II,"so loved, and so dear? Odysseus is lost for ever, and if thou go we"
870,II,"shall lose thee too, for the suitors will plot thy ruin while thou art"
871,II,"far away."""
872,II,
873,II,"""Fear nothing for me,"" answered Telemachus, ""Heaven's eye is upon me,"
874,II,and the hand of Zeus is spread over me. Swear to me now that thou wilt
875,II,"not tell my mother until twelve days have past."" Eurycleia swore as he"
876,II,"bade her, and at once set about making the preparations for his"
877,II,journey.
878,II,
879,II,"The suitors were in high spirits at the result of the meeting, and"
880,II,they ate heavily and drank deeply to celebrate their triumph. Hence it
881,II,"happened that they retired to rest earlier than usual, being drowsy"
882,II,from their intemperate revel; and when Telemachus returned to the
883,II,"banquet-hall he found all the guests departed, and the servants"
884,II,"removing the remains of the feast. Soon afterwards Mentor appeared,"
885,II,and announced that the ship lay ready at her moorings outside the
886,II,"harbour. The stores were carried down to the sea, and stowed under the"
887,II,"rowers' benches. ""All hands on board!"" cried Mentor, and took his"
888,II,"place in the stern, Telemachus sitting by his side. The crew sat ready"
889,II,"at their oars, the ship was cast loose from the moorings, and a few"
890,II,vigorous strokes impelled her into deep water. Then a strong breeze
891,II,"sprang up from the west, the big sail was set, and the good ship"
892,II,"bounded joyfully over the waves, with the white wake roaring behind."
893,II,"The oars were shipped, the sheets made fast, and all the company"
894,II,"pledged each other in brimming cups, drinking to their prosperous"
895,II,voyage.

900,II,The Visit to Nestor at Pylos
901,II,
902,II,
903,I,I
904,I,
905,I,So all night long the ship clave her way; and at sunrise they reached
906,I,"the flat, sandy coast of Pylos. There they found a great multitude"
907,I,"assembled, keeping the feast of Poseidon with sacrifices of oxen. The"
908,I,solemn rite was nearly ended when they brought their vessel to land.
909,I,
910,I,"""Courage, now,"" said Mentor to Telemachus, seeing the young lad"
911,I,"somewhat abashed by the presence of so large a company. ""Remember whom"
912,I,"thou seekest, and lay thy modest scruples aside. Thou seest that"
913,I,"venerable man, still tall and erect, though he numbers more than a"
914,I,"hundred years. That is Nestor, son of Neleus, wisest of the Greeks, a"
915,I,"king and the friend and counsellor of kings. Go straight to him, and"
916,I,"tell him thy errand."""
917,I,
918,I,"Seeing Telemachus, who was a homebred youth, still hanging back, in"
919,I,"dread of that august presence, Mentor renewed his friendly"
920,I,"remonstrances, ""What, still tongue-tied?"" he said, taking him by the"
921,I,"arm, and leading him forward. ""Heaven mend thy wits, poor lad! Knowest"
922,I,"thou not that thou art a child of great hopes, and a favourite of"
923,I,"heaven?"""
924,I,
925,I,"When they came to the place where Nestor was seated with his sons,"
926,I,they found them busy preparing the feast which followed the sacrifice.
927,I,As soon as those of Nestor's company saw the strangers they came
928,I,"forward in a body to greet them, and made them sit down in places of"
929,I,"honour, where soft fleeces were heaped up on the level sand. A youth,"
930,I,"about the same age as Telemachus, placed a goblet of gold in Mentor's"
931,I,"hand, and gave him that portion of the flesh which was set apart as an"
932,I,"offering to the gods. ""Welcome, friend,"" he said, after pledging him"
933,I,"from the cup. ""Put up thy prayer with us to the lord Poseidon, for it"
934,I,"is to his feast that ye have come. And when thou hast prayed, give the"
935,I,"cup to thy young companion, who has been bred, methinks, as I have, to"
936,I,"deeds of piety."""
937,I,
938,I,"Mentor first asked a blessing on their hosts, and then prayed for a"
939,I,prosperous issue to their own adventure. After him Telemachus uttered
940,I,"his prayer in similar words, and then they all sat down to meat. When"
941,I,"they had finished, Nestor looked earnestly at them, and asked them who"
942,I,"they were, and what was the purpose of their journey. ""Are ye"
943,I,"merchants,"" he said, ""or bold buccaneers, who roam the seas, a peril"
944,I,"to others, and ever in peril themselves?"""
945,I,
946,I,"Telemachus, cheered by good fare, and encouraged by the kind manner of"
947,I,"Nestor, answered confidently, and explained the nature of his errand."
948,I,"""Concerning all the other Greeks,"" he added, ""we know at least the"
949,I,manner of their death; but even this poor comfort is denied to the
950,I,"wife and son of Odysseus. Therefore, if thou hast aught to tell, I"
951,I,"beseech thee by thy friendship with my father, let me know all, and"
952,I,"soften not the tale, out of kindness or pity to me."""
953,I,
954,I,"""Ah! my friend,"" answered Nestor. ""What woeful memories thou hast"
955,I,"awakened by thy words!--perils by land and perils by water, long years"
956,I,"of siege and battle, sleepless nights and toilsome days. Ill-fated"
957,I,"land of Troy! the grave of Grecian chivalry! There lies heroic Ajax,"
958,I,"there lies Achilles, and Patroclus, sage in counsel, and there lies"
959,I,"Antilochus, my own dear son, fleet of foot and strong of hand. And art"
960,I,"thou indeed the son of Odysseus, whom none could match in craft and"
961,I,"strategy? But why do I ask? When thou speakest, I seem to hear the"
962,I,"very tones of his voice. He was my friend, one with me in mind and"
963,I,"heart, and during all the time of the siege we took counsel together"
964,I,for the weal of Greece. But when the war was over disasters came thick
965,I,"and fast upon the host. And first, division arose between the two sons"
966,I,of Atreus; Agamemnon wished to abide in Troy until sacrifice had been
967,I,"offered to appease the anger of Athene, but Menelaus advised immediate"
968,I,"departure. The party of Menelaus, of whom I was one, launched their"
969,I,"ships and sailed to Tenedos; there Odysseus, who had set sail with us,"
970,I,"put back to the mainland of Asia, wishing to do a favour to Agamemnon."
971,I,"But I, and Diomede with me, set forth at once, and, crossing the sea"
972,I,"from Lesbos, came to Euboea; thence, after sacrifice to Poseidon, I"
973,I,"steered due south, and parting from Diomede at Argos continued my"
974,I,"voyage, and landed safe in Pylos. Thus it happened that I was not"
975,I,witness of the good or evil fortunes of the other Greeks on their
976,I,"voyage home, and know only by rumour how they fared. Of Agamemnon's"
977,I,"fate thou hast surely heard thyself, how he was murdered on his own"
978,I,"hearth by the treachery of Ægisthus, and how the murder was avenged by"
979,I,"Orestes. Happy the father who has such a son! And such, methinks, art"
980,I,"thou."""
981,I,
982,I,"""Ay,"" answered Telemachus, when Nestor had finished his long story, ""I"
983,I,have heard of that glorious deed; and would to heaven that by the
984,I,might of my hands I might so take vengeance on the evil men who have
985,I,"come to woo my mother, and who fill my house with injury and outrage."""
986,I,
987,I,"""Ah! thou hast reminded me,"" said Nestor. ""I heard of the shameful"
988,I,wrong which thou hast suffered. But do not despair! Who knows but that
989,I,"Odysseus will yet return, and make them drink the cup which they have"
990,I,"filled? It may well come to pass, if Athene continues to thy house the"
991,I,"favour which she showed thy father, plain for all eyes to see, in the"
992,I,"land of Troy."""
993,I,
994,I,"""Nay, 'tis too much to hope,"" answered Telemachus with a sigh, ""the"
995,I,"thing is too hard--even a god could hardly bring it to pass."""
996,I,
997,I,"""Now out on thy faint heart!"" cried Mentor, who hitherto had sat"
998,I,"silent. ""Better for him that his homecoming should be long delayed"
999,I,"than that he should have died, like Agamemnon, fresh from his victory."
1000,I,"Heaven will guide him yet to his own door, though now he be at the"
1001,I,"uttermost parts of the earth."""
1002,I,
1003,I,"Telemachus shook his head as he answered: ""No more of that, I pray"
1004,I,"thee; it can never be."" Then, addressing Nestor, he said: ""I would"
1005,I,fain ask thee more concerning the manner of Agamemnon's death. Where
1006,I,was Menelaus when that foul deed was done? And how did Ægisthus
1007,I,"contrive to slay a man mightier far than himself?"""
1008,I,
1009,I,"""Thou askest well,"" replied Nestor. ""Menelaus was far away, or we"
1010,I,should have another tale to tell. And had the return of Menelaus not
1011,I,"been delayed, vengeance would have been forestalled by many years."
1012,I,"Yea, the dogs would have eaten the flesh of that vile churl, and not a"
1013,I,tear would have been shed for him. But this is how it fell out: while
1014,I,"we were toiling and warring at Troy, Ægisthus sat close to the ear of"
1015,I,"Clytæmnestra, Agamemnon's wife, and poured sweet poison into her mind."
1016,I,"For a long while she refused to hearken to his base proposals, for she"
1017,I,"was of a good understanding, and moreover there was ever at her side a"
1018,I,"minstrel, into whose care Agamemnon had given her when he went to"
1019,I,"Troy. But Ægisthus seized upon the minstrel, and left him on a desert"
1020,I,island to be devoured by carrion birds. Then Clytæmnestra yielded to
1021,I,"his suit, and he brought her to his own house."
1022,I,
1023,I,"""But as to thy question concerning Menelaus, he left Troy in my"
1024,I,"company, as I told thee, and we sailed together as far as Sunium."
1025,I,"There Menelaus lost his steersman, who was visited by Apollo with"
1026,I,"sudden death, as he sat by the helm; so he remained there to bury his"
1027,I,comrade. But his misfortunes were not yet over; for when he reached
1028,I,"the steep headland at Malea a violent storm arose, and parted his"
1029,I,"fleet. Some of his ships ran into Crete for shelter, while he himself"
1030,I,"was carried away to Egypt, where he remained many days, and gathered"
1031,I,store of wealth.
1032,I,
1033,I,"""Now thou understandest why Ægisthus was able to work his will on"
1034,I,"Agamemnon, and why he escaped vengeance so long. For seven years he"
1035,I,"sat on the throne of golden Mycenæ, and grievously oppressed the"
1036,I,"people. But in the eighth year came Orestes, and cut him off in the"
1037,I,"fulness of his sin; and on that very day Menelaus came to him, loaded"
1038,I,with the treasures of Egypt.
1039,I,
1040,I,"""Far and long had he wandered; but so do not thou, my child. Leave not"
1041,I,"thy house unguarded, while so many foes are gathered against thee,"
1042,I,lest when thou return thou find thyself stripped of all. But to
1043,I,Menelaus I would have thee go; him thou must by all means consult; for
1044,I,who knows what he may have learnt on that wondrous voyage? Vast is the
1045,I,"space of water over which he has travelled, not to be measured in one"
1046,I,"year by a bird in her speediest flight. If thou wilt, thou canst go to"
1047,I,"Sparta in thy ship, or if thou choose to go by land, my chariots and"
1048,I,"my horses are thine for this service, and my sons shall guide you on"
1049,I,"the way."""
1050,I,
1051,II,II
1052,II,
1053,II,"Amid such talk as this, with many a brave story ""of moving accidents"
1054,II,"by flood and field,"" and many a pithy saw from the white-haired"
1055,II,"Nestor, who had lived so long and seen so much, the hours glided"
1056,II,"swiftly by, and the red sun was stooping to the horizon when Mentor"
1057,II,"rose from his seat and said: ""We must be going; the hour of rest is at"
1058,II,"hand, and to-morrow we have far to go."""
1059,II,
1060,II,"""Tarry yet a little,"" said Nestor, ""and eat a morsel and drink a cup"
1061,II,"with us. And after that, if ye are fain to sleep, ye shall have fit"
1062,II,lodging in my house. Heaven forbid that I should suffer such guests as
1063,II,"you to sleep on the cold deck, covered with dew, as if I were some"
1064,II,"needy wretch, with never a blanket to spare for a friend. May the gods"
1065,II,"preserve me from such a reproach!"""
1066,II,
1067,II,"""Thou sayest well,"" answered Mentor, ""and Telemachus shall be thy"
1068,II,"guest to-night. But for me, I pray thee have me excused. My place is"
1069,II,"on the ship, that I may give an eye to the crew, for I am the only man"
1070,II,"of experience among them. And to-morrow I must go to Elis, to recover"
1071,II,a debt of long standing due to me there. I leave Telemachus to thy
1072,II,"care, that thou mayest cherish him and speed him on his way."""
1073,II,
1074,II,"As he said these words, while all eyes were fixed upon him, the"
1075,II,"speaker vanished from sight, and in his stead a great sea-eagle rose"
1076,II,"into the air, and sped westwards towards the setting sun. Long they"
1077,II,"sat speechless and amazed, and Nestor was the first to break the"
1078,II,"silence. ""Great things are in store for thee, my son,"" said he to"
1079,II,"Telemachus, ""since thou keepest such company thus early in life. This"
1080,II,"was none other than Jove's mighty daughter, Athene, who honoured thy"
1081,II,"father so highly among the Greeks. Be gracious to us, our queen, and"
1082,II,let thy blessing rest on me and on my house! and I will offer to thee
1083,II,"a yearling heifer, that hath never felt the yoke. To thee will I"
1084,II,"sacrifice her, when I have made gilt her horns with gold."""
1085,II,
1086,II,"Then Nestor led the way to his house, and Telemachus sat down with him"
1087,II,and his sons in the hall. And they filled a bowl with wine eleven
1088,II,"years old, exceeding choice, which was reserved for honoured guests."
1089,II,"And after they had finished the bowl, and offered prayer to Athene,"
1090,II,they parted for the night. For Telemachus a bed was prepared in the
1091,II,"portico, and close by him slept Pisistratus, the youngest of Nestor's"
1092,II,sons.
1093,II,
1094,II,"When Telemachus rose next morning he found his host already afoot,"
1095,II,giving orders to his sons to prepare the sacrifice to Athene. One was
1096,II,"sent to fetch the heifer, another to summon the goldsmith, and a third"
1097,II,"to bring up the crew of Telemachus' ship, while the rest busied"
1098,II,themselves in raising the altar and making all ready for the
1099,II,sacrifice.
1100,II,
1101,II,"Presently the heifer was driven lowing into the courtyard, and the"
1102,II,goldsmith followed with the instruments of his art. Nestor gave him
1103,II,"gold, and the smith beat it into thin leaf with his hammer, and laid"
1104,II,it skilfully over the horns of the heifer. A handmaid brought pure
1105,II,"water, and barley-meal in a basket, while one of Nestor's sons stood"
1106,II,"ready with an axe, and another held a bowl to catch the blood. Then"
1107,II,"Nestor dipped his hands in the water, took barley-meal from the basket"
1108,II,"and sprinkled it on the head of the beast, and cutting a tuft of hair"
1109,II,"from the forehead cast it into the fire. The prayer was spoken, and"
1110,II,all due rites being ended he who held the axe smote the heifer on the
1111,II,"head, just behind the horns. The women raised the sacrificial cry as"
1112,II,the heifer dropped to the ground; and next they whose office it was
1113,II,"lifted up the victim's head, and Pisistratus cut the throat. When the"
1114,II,"last quiver of life was over they flayed the carcass, cut strips of"
1115,II,"flesh from the thighs, and enveloping them in fat, burnt them on the"
1116,II,altar. The gods had now their share of the feast; the rest was cut
1117,II,"into slices, and broiled over the live embers."
1118,II,
1119,II,"While the meal was preparing, Telemachus enjoyed the refreshment of a"
1120,II,"bath; and Polycaste, the youngest of Nestor's daughters, waited on"
1121,II,him; for such was the patriarchal simplicity of those days. When he
1122,II,"had bathed, and finished his morning meal, the chariot was brought"
1123,II,"out, and a strong pair of horses led under the yoke. And the"
1124,II,"house-dame came with a basket, loaded with wine and delicate viands,"
1125,II,and placed it behind the seat. Telemachus took his place by the side

1132,II,"That night they slept at the house of a friend, and early next day"
1133,II,"they continued their journey. The way grew steep and difficult, great"
1134,II,"masses of mountains rose near at hand, and at length they entered a"
1135,II,"wide valley, covered with waving fields of corn. By sunset they"

1146,I,
1147,I,Menelaus was keeping the double marriage feast of his son and
1148,I,"daughter, and his house was thronged with wedding guests. All sat"
1149,I,"silent and attentive, listening to the strains of a harper, and"
1150,I,"watching the gambols of a pair of tumblers, who were whirling in giddy"
1151,I,"reels round the hall. Presently voices were heard at the entrance, and"
1152,I,one of the squires of Menelaus came and informed his master that two
1153,I,"strangers of noble mien were standing without, craving hospitality."
1154,I,"""Shall I bring them in,"" asked the squire, ""or send them on to another"
1155,I,"house?"""
1156,I,
1157,I,"""Hast thou lost thy wits?"" answered Menelaus in some heat, being"
1158,I,"touched in his most sensitive point. ""Shall we, who owe so much to the"
1159,I,"kindness of strangers, in the long years of our wanderings, send any"
1160,I,"man from our doors? Unyoke the horses, and bid our new guests enter."""
1161,I,
1162,I,"Four or five servants hastened to do his bidding. The horses, covered"
1163,I,"with sweat from their hard journey, were unyoked and led into the"
1164,I,"stable, and Telemachus, with his companion, was ushered with all"
1165,I,courtesy into the great hall of Menelaus. The palace was one of the
1166,I,"wealthiest and most splendid in Greece; and Telemachus, accustomed to"
1167,I,"a much humbler style of dwelling, stood amazed at the glories which"
1168,I,met his eyes. After bathing and changing their raiment they returned
1169,I,"to the hall, and were assigned places close to the chair of Menelaus."
1170,I,
1171,I,"The prince greeted them kindly, and said: ""Welcome to our halls, young"
1172,I,"sirs. Ye are, as I see, of no mean descent, for Zeus has set his stamp"
1173,I,"on your faces,[1] and none can mistake the signs of kingly birth. When"
1174,I,"ye have eaten, we will inquire of you further."""

1178,I,
1179,I,A plentiful and delicate meal was promptly set before the young
1180,I,"travellers, and they ate and drank with keen appetite. When they had"
1181,I,"finished, Telemachus said to Pisistratus, speaking low, that he might"
1182,I,"not be overheard: ""Dear son of Nestor, is not this a brave place! Hast"
1183,I,"thou ever seen such lavish ornament of silver, and gold, and ivory?"
1184,I,Surely such is the dwelling of Olympian Zeus; more magnificent it can
1185,I,"hardly be."""
1186,I,
1187,I,"The quick ear of Menelaus caught his last words, and he answered,"
1188,I,"smiling: ""Nay, my friend, no mortal may vie with the everlasting"
1189,I,"glories of Zeus. But whether any man can equal me in riches, I know"
1190,I,"not. For indeed I wandered far and long to gather all this treasure,"
1191,I,"to Cyprus, and Phoenicia, and Egypt, to Æthiopia, and Sidon, and the"
1192,I,"Afric shore, a land unmatched in its countless multitudes of sheep."
1193,I,"There the ewes bring forth young three times a year, and the poorest"
1194,I,"shepherd has abundance of cheese, and flesh, and milk. From all these"
1195,I,"lands I gathered many a costly freight, and now I dwell in the midst"
1196,I,"of plenty. Nevertheless my heart is sad, when I think of all that I"
1197,I,"have lost. Had I returned home straight from Troy, I should have come"
1198,I,"back a poor man, for my house had gone to waste in my absence; but I"
1199,I,"should not have had to mourn for the death of my brother, struck down,"
1200,I,"as doubtless ye have heard, by a murderer's hand. And then the thought"
1201,I,"lies heavy upon me of all those who fell in my cause at Troy, and"
1202,I,"especially of one who was dear to me above all, Odysseus, ever the"
1203,I,foremost in every toil and adventure. His image haunts me by day and
1204,I,"by night, marring my slumbers, and making my food taste bitter in my"
1205,I,"mouth. He was a man of many woes, and sorrowful is the lot of his wife"
1206,I,"Penelope and Telemachus his son."""
1207,I,
1208,I,"At this mention of his father Telemachus could not control his tears,"
1209,I,"but covered his face with his mantle, and wept without restraint."
1210,I,"Menelaus saw his emotion, and began to suspect who he was; but for the"
1211,I,present he said nothing.
1212,I,
1213,I,"A slight stir was now heard at the back of the hall, and a low murmur"
1214,I,"went round among the guests, who whispered to each other: ""The Queen!"
1215,I,"The Queen!"" And in she came softly, with slow and stately step, Helen,"
1216,I,"the daughter of Tyndareus, and wife of Menelaus, fairest among all the"
1217,I,high-born dames of Greece. Her wondrous beauty was now ripened into
1218,I,"matronly perfection, but now and then a shadow seemed to pass over her"
1219,I,"face, like the ghost of an old sin, long repented and forgiven. A"
1220,I,"handmaid set a chair for her, throwing over it a soft rug, and brought"
1221,I,"a footstool for her feet, while another bare a silver basket, with"
1222,I,"rims of gold, and placed it ready, filled with purple yarn. When Helen"
1223,I,"was seated, she gazed long and earnestly at Telemachus, and then,"
1224,I,"turning to her husband, she said; ""Menelaus, shall I utter the thought"
1225,I,"which is in my heart? Nay, speak I must. Ne'er saw I such a likeness,"
1226,I,"either in man or woman, as is the likeness of this fair youth to"
1227,I,"Odysseus. Surely this is Telemachus, whom he left an infant in Ithaca"
1228,I,when the host was summoned to Troy to fight in a worthless woman's
1229,I,"cause."""
1230,I,
1231,I,"""I have marked it too,"" answered Menelaus. ""Such were his very hands"
1232,I,"and feet, and the carriage of his head, and the glance of his eye."
1233,I,"Moreover, when I made mention of Odysseus he covered his face, and"
1234,I,"wept full sore."""
1235,I,
1236,I,"Telemachus was still too much distressed to speak, and Pisistratus had"
1237,I,"to answer for him: ""Thou sayest truly, my lord; it is Telemachus"
1238,I,"himself. Nestor sent me with him to inquire of thee, and crave counsel"
1239,I,"of thy wisdom. He is left like an orphan in his home, with none to aid"
1240,I,"him, and take his father's place."""
1241,I,
1242,I,"Then Menelaus drew near to Telemachus, and taking his hand kindly"
1243,I,"said: ""Welcome again, and thrice welcome to these halls, thou son of"
1244,I,my trustiest friend and helper! It was the dream of my life to bring
1245,I,"Odysseus and all his household from Ithaca, and give him a home and a"
1246,I,"city in this land, that we might grow old together in friendship and"
1247,I,"loving-kindness, never to be parted until death. But envious heaven"
1248,I,"has blighted my hopes and hindered his return."""
1249,I,
1250,I,"At these sad words every eye was moist, and all sat silent, absorbed"
1251,I,"in sorrowful memories. Pisistratus was the first to speak, and his"
1252,I,"words roused the rest from their melancholy mood. ""Son of Atreus,"" he"
1253,I,"said, ""my father has often spoken of thy wisdom, and perchance it has"
1254,I,"taught thee that sorrow is an ill guest at a banquet. The dead,"
1255,I,"indeed, claim their due, and he would be hard-hearted who would grudge"
1256,I,"them the poor tribute of a tear. But we cannot mourn for ever, even"
1257,I,"for such a one as my brother Antilochus, whom I never saw, but thou"
1258,I,"knewest him well, stout in battle, and swift in the pursuit."""
1259,I,
1260,I,"""'Tis well said,"" replied Menelaus. ""Thou art wise beyond thy years,"
1261,I,"and a true son of Nestor. Happy is he, beyond the common lot of men,"
1262,I,and smooth and fair runs the thread of his Destiny. He dwells in a
1263,I,"green old age in his father's house, and sees his sons growing up"
1264,I,"around him, true heirs of his valour and prudence. Now let us banish"
1265,I,"care, and get to our supper, for the day is far spent, and we have"
1266,I,"matter for talk which will last us all the morrow."""
1267,I,
1268,I,"When they had finished eating, and the cups were about to be"
1269,I,"replenished, Helen rose from her seat, and, whispering a few words to"
1270,I,"the cupbearer, left the hall. In a few minutes she returned, carrying"
1271,I,"in her hand a small phial, whose contents she poured into the great"
1272,I,"mixing-bowl from which the cups were filled. ""Now, drink,"" she said,"
1273,I,"""and fear not that black care will pay us a second visit to-night. I"
1274,I,"have poured into the wine a drug of wondrous potency and virtue, which"
1275,I,"was given me in Egypt by Polydamna, the wife of Thon. Many such drugs"
1276,I,"the soil of Egypt bears, some baneful and some good. And the Egyptians"
1277,I,are skilled in such craft beyond all mankind. He who drinks of this
1278,I,"drug will be armed for that day against all the assaults of sorrow,"
1279,I,"and will not shed one tear, though his father and mother were to die,"
1280,I,"no, not though he saw his brother or his son slain before his eyes. So"
1281,I,"mighty is the virtue of this drug."" And when they had drunk of the"
1282,I,"magic potion Helen began again: ""'Tis now the witching hour, when all"
1283,I,"hearts are opened, and the burden of life presses lightest on men's"
1284,I,"shoulders. Come, let me tell you a story, one among many, of the deeds"
1285,I,"and the hardihood of Odysseus. It was in the days of the siege, and"
1286,I,the Trojans were kept close prisoners in their city by the leaguer of
1287,I,"the Greeks. Then he disguised himself as a beggar, clothed himself in"
1288,I,"filthy rags, and marred his goodly person with cruel stripes. In such"
1289,I,"fashion he entered the foemen's walls, as if he were a slave flying"
1290,I,from a hard master.[1] And I alone in all the city knew who he was. So
1291,I,"I brought him to my house, and began to question him; but he made as"
1292,I,"if he understood not. But when I entertained him as an honoured guest,"
1293,I,"and swore a solemn oath not to betray him, he trusted me, and declared"
1294,I,all the purpose of the Greeks. At dead of night he stole out into the
1295,I,"town, and, having slain many of the Trojans with the edge of the"
1296,I,"sword, he went back to the camp, and brought much information to his"
1297,I,friends.
1298,I,
1299,I,"[Footnote 1: Compare the stratagem of Zopyrus, in ""Stories from Greek"
1300,I,"History.""]"
1301,I,
1302,I,"""When morning came, the voice of wailing rose high in the streets of"
1303,I,"Troy; but my heart rejoiced, for I was filled with longing for my"
1304,I,"home, and my eyes were opened to the folly which I had wrought by the"
1305,I,"beguilement of Aphrodite, when I left my fatherland and broke faith"
1306,I,"with my lord."""
1307,I,
1308,I,"""Tis a good story, and thou hast told it well, fair wife,"" said"
1309,I,"Menelaus. ""Now hear my tale. It was the time when I and the other"
1310,I,champions were shut up in the wooden horse; and Odysseus was with us.
1311,I,"Then thou camest thither, led, I suppose, by some god, hostile to"
1312,I,"Greece, who wished to work our ruin; and Deiphobus followed thee."
1313,I,"Three times thou didst pace around our hollow ambush, feeling it with"
1314,I,"thy hands, and calling aloud to the princes of Greece by name; and thy"
1315,I,"voice was like the voice of all their wives. There we sat, I, and"
1316,I,"Diomede, and the rest, and heard thee calling. Now I and Diomede were"
1317,I,"minded to answer thee, or to go forth and confer with thee; but"
1318,I,"Odysseus suffered it not, and when one of our number was about to lift"
1319,I,"up his voice he pressed his hands on that foolish mouth, and"
1320,I,restrained him by force until thou hadst left the place. And so he
1321,I,"saved all our lives."""
1322,I,
1323,I,"""Yes,"" said Telemachus, ""he had a heart of iron. But what has it"
1324,I,"availed him? It could not save him from ruin. Howbeit, no more of"
1325,I,"this; 'tis time to go to rest and forget our cares in sleep."""
1326,I,
1327,II,II
1328,II,
1329,II,Early next morning Telemachus found his host sitting by his bedside;
1330,II,"and as soon as he was dressed Menelaus led him to a quiet place, and"
1331,II,inquired the reason of his coming. He listened with attention while
1332,II,Telemachus explained the purpose of his visit; but when he heard of
1333,II,"the suitors, and their riot and waste, he was filled with indignation."
1334,II,
1335,II,"""What!"" he cried, ""would these dastards fill the seat and wed the wife"
1336,II,"of that mighty man? Their lot shall be the lot of a pair of fawns,"
1337,II,left by the mother hind in a lion's lair. The hind goes forth to
1338,II,"pasture, and in her absence the lion returns, and devours them where"
1339,II,"they lie. Even so shall Odysseus return, and bring swift destruction"
1340,II,on the whole crew.
1341,II,
1342,II,"""But thou hast asked me what I know of the fortunes of Odysseus, since"
1343,II,he departed from Troy; and verily I will tell thee all that I have
1344,II,"heard, without turning aside in my tale. I must go back to the time"
1345,II,when I lay wind-bound with my ships in a little island off the mouth
1346,II,"of the Nile. The island is called Pharos, and it is distant a day's"
1347,II,"voyage from the river's mouth. I had lain there twenty days, and still"
1348,II,not a breath of air ruffled the glassy surface of the sea. All our
1349,II,"stores were consumed, and we had nothing to eat but the fish which my"
1350,II,men caught with rudely fashioned hooks and lines. One day I left my
1351,II,"men busy with their angling, and wandered away along the shore, full"
1352,II,"of sad thoughts, and wondering how all this would end. Suddenly I"
1353,II,"heard a light footstep on the pebbles, and there stepped forth from"
1354,II,"behind a tall rock a young maiden in white, flowing robes. Full of"
1355,II,dread I saw her coming towards me; for I knew that she was no mortal
1356,II,"woman. But her look was gracious, and her voice was sweet; so I took"
1357,II,"courage as she said: 'Who art thou, stranger, and why lingerest thou"
1358,II,"with thy company in this desert place? I am Eidothea, daughter of"
1359,II,"Proteus, the ancient one of the sea; and I am ready to help thee, if"
1360,II,thou wilt tell me thy need.'
1361,II,
1362,II,"""Then I told her how I had been kept an unwilling captive on the"
1363,II,"island, and begged her to let me know what power I had offended, that"
1364,II,"he might be appeased by sacrifice, and suffer the wind to blow. 'There"
1365,II,"is one who can tell thee all that thou desirest to know,' answered"
1366,II,"she. 'Yea, Proteus, my father, will show thee how to win thy path"
1367,II,"across the watery waste. No secrets are hidden from him, neither on"
1368,II,earth nor in the sea; and he can tell thee all that hath befallen in
1369,II,"thy house in the long years of thine absence. Now hearken, and I will"
1370,II,tell thee how thou mayest wring from him all his secrets. Every day at
1371,II,"noon he comes forth from the sea, and lays him down to sleep in a"
1372,II,rocky cave; and about him are couched his herd of seals. I will bring
1373,II,"thee to the place in the early morning, and set thee in ambush to"
1374,II,await his coming. Choose three of the stoutest of thy men to aid thee
1375,II,"in the adventure, and as soon as thou seest him asleep rush upon him"
1376,II,"and hold him fast. He will struggle hard, and take a hundred different"
1377,II,"shapes; but loose him not until he return to his own form, and then"
1378,II,will he reveal to thee all that he has to tell.'
1379,II,
1380,II,"""So saying, the goddess disappeared beneath the waves. Next morning I"
1381,II,"went with three picked men to the appointed place, and soon Eidothea"
1382,II,"arrived, bearing four hides of seals, freshly flayed. Then she"
1383,II,"hollowed out four pits in the sand for us to lie in, and clothed us in"
1384,II,"the skins, and couched us together. Now that bed had like to have been"
1385,II,"our last, for we were stifled by the dreadful stench of the seabred"
1386,II,"seals. But the goddess saw our distress, and found a remedy; for she"
1387,II,"brought ambrosia and set it beneath our nostrils, and that heavenly"
1388,II,perfume overpowered the noisome stench.
1389,II,
1390,II,"""So all the morning we lay and wafted patiently, and at noon the seals"
1391,II,came up out of the sea and lay down in order on the sand. Last of all
1392,II,"came Proteus, and counted his herd, reckoning us among their number,"
1393,II,"with no suspicion of guile. We waited until he was fast asleep, and"
1394,II,then we rushed from our ambush and seized him hand and foot. Long and
1395,II,"hard was the struggle, and many the shapes which he took. First he"
1396,II,"became a bearded lion, then a snake, then a leopard, then a huge boar;"
1397,II,"after these he turned into running water and a tall, leafy tree. But"
1398,II,"we only held him the more firmly, and at last he grew weary and spake"
1399,II,"to me in his own shape: 'What wouldst thou have, son of Atreus, and"
1400,II,who has taught thee to outwit me and take me captive by craft?'
1401,II,
1402,II,"""'Thou knowest my need,' I answered; 'why dost thou waste thy words?"
1403,II,Tell me rather how I may find release from my present strait'
1404,II,
1405,II,"""'Hear, then,' said he: 'thou hast forgotten thy duty to Zeus and the"
1406,II,"other gods. Not a victim bled, not a prayer was offered, when thou"
1407,II,"didst embark on this voyage. Go back to Egypt, to the holy waters of"
1408,II,"Nile, and there pay thy vows, and offer a great sacrifice to their"
1409,II,"offended deity; thus, and thus only, canst thou win thy return to"
1410,II,thine own country and thy stately home.'
1411,II,
1412,II,"""When I heard this my heart was broken within me, to think of that"
1413,II,long and perilous path across the misty deep. Nevertheless I consented
1414,II,"to take that journey, for I saw no other way of escape. And after I"
1415,II,"had promised to obey him, I began to inquire further of the fate of"
1416,II,"Nestor and the rest, whom I left behind me on my way home."
1417,II,
1418,II,"""''Tis a grievous story that thou requirest of me,' said Proteus, 'and"
1419,II,thou shalt have little joy in the hearing. Many have been taken and
1420,II,"many left. Two only perished in returning, and one is still living, a"
1421,II,"prisoner of the sea. Ajax has paid his debt to Athene, whose shrine he"
1422,II,polluted; and this was the manner of his death: when his vessel was
1423,II,"shattered by that great tempest, he himself escaped to a rock, for"
1424,II,Poseidon came to his aid. But even the peril which he had just escaped
1425,II,"could not subdue his haughtiness and his pride, and he uttered an"
1426,II,"impious vaunt, boasting that in despite of heaven he had escaped a"
1427,II,"watery grave. Then Poseidon was wroth, and smote the rock with his"
1428,II,"trident, and that half of the rock on which Ajax was sitting fell into"

1432,II,After a long and stormy voyage he at length brought his shattered
1433,II,"vessels safe into harbour, and set foot on his native soil at Argos."
1434,II,With tears of joy and thankfulness he fell on his knees and kissed the
1435,II,"sod, trusting that now his sorrows were passed. Now there was a"
1436,II,watchman whom Ægisthus had posted on a high place commanding the sea
1437,II,"to look out for Agamemnon's return. A whole year he watched, for he"
1438,II,had been promised a great reward. And when he saw the king's face he
1439,II,went with all speed to tell his master. Forthwith Ægisthus prepared an
1440,II,ambush of twenty armed men; these he kept in hiding at the back of the
1441,II,"hall, while he ordered his servants to prepare a great banquet. Then"
1442,II,"he went to meet Agamemnon with horses and with chariots, and brought"
1443,II,"him to his house, and made good cheer. And when he had feasted him he"
1444,II,"smote and slew him, as a man slaughters an ox in his stall.'"
1445,II,
1446,II,"""At that tale of horror I fell upon the sand, weeping bitterly, for I"
1447,II,had no desire to live any longer or look on the light of the sun. Long
1448,II,"I lay mourning, as one who had lost all hope, but at last Proteus"
1449,II,"checked the torrent of my passion, and bade me take thought of my own"
1450,II,"homecoming. 'This is no time,' he said, 'to melt away in womanish"

1453,II,
1454,II,"""Somewhat comforted by these words, I took courage to ask who was the"
1455,II,man of whom he had spoken as a prisoner of the sea. 'It is the son of
1456,II,"Laertes,' answered Proteus, 'Odysseus, whose home is in Ithaca. I"
1457,II,"myself saw him on an island, in the house of the nymph Calypso; and"
1458,II,"sore he wept because he could not leave the goddess, who holds him in"
1459,II,"thrall, and will not suffer him to return to his country.'"
1460,II,
1461,II,"""Lastly, he told me concerning my own fate. 'Thou, Menelaus,' he said,"
1462,II,"'art exempt from the common lot of men, because thou art the husband"
1463,II,"of Helen, and she is a daughter of Zeus. Therefore it is not appointed"
1464,II,"for thee to die, but when thine hour is come the gods shall convey"
1465,II,"thee to the Elysian fields, where dwell the elect spirits in"

1470,II,Thus happily ended the story of the Spartan prince's wanderings. And
1471,II,"when he had finished, he pressed Telemachus to prolong his visit; but"
1472,II,"that prudent youth declined the invitation, pleading the necessity of"
1473,II,"a speedy return to Ithaca, that he might keep an eye on the doings of"
1474,II,"the suitors. Menelaus was compelled to allow the justice of his plea,"
1475,II,and accordingly all things were made ready for a speedy departure.
1476,II,
1477,III,III
1478,III,
1479,III,"We must now return to Ithaca, and see what reception was preparing for"
1480,III,Telemachus when he came back from his adventurous journey. Two or
1481,III,three days after he left Ithaca the suitors were gathered before the
1482,III,"doors of Odysseus, playing at quoits, or hurling their javelins at a"
1483,III,"mark. Presently a young noble came up to the group, and addressing"
1484,III,"Antinous, who was watching the sport, asked him if he had heard aught"
1485,III,"of Telemachus. ""I would fain know how long he is like to be absent"
1486,III,"from Ithaca,"" he said; ""for he has borrowed my ship, and I have need"
1487,III,"of her. Know ye when he is to return from Pylos?"""
1488,III,
1489,III,Antinous heard him with amazement; for neither he nor any other of the
1490,III,"suitors knew that Telemachus had sailed from Ithaca, supposing him to"
1491,III,be absent on his farm. So he questioned the youth closely as to the
1492,III,"time and manner of that voyage, how the crew was composed, and whether"
1493,III,"the vessel was lent willingly, or taken by force. ""Of my own free will"
1494,III,"I lent her,"" answered the lad, ""why should I not help him in his need?"
1495,III,"As to the crew, they were all picked men, and well born; and the"
1496,III,"captain was Mentor, or some god in his likeness; for I saw Mentor"
1497,III,"yesterday in the town, and not a ship has touched at Ithaca since they"
1498,III,"sailed."""
1499,III,
1500,III,When he who had lent the ship was departed the suitors left their
1501,III,"sports, and drawing close together began to converse in low tones."
1502,III,"They were full of anger against Telemachus because of this journey,"
1503,III,"which gave the lie to their malicious prophecies, and was not without"
1504,III,prospect of danger to themselves. Accordingly Antinous found ready
1505,III,"hearers when he stood up and spoke as follows:--""This forward boy must"
1506,III,"be put down, or he will mar our wooing. It is a great deed which he"
1507,III,"has done, and he will not stop here, unless we find means to cut short"
1508,III,his adventures. Now hear what I advise: let us man a ship and moor her
1509,III,"in the narrow sea between Ithaca and Samos, and lie in wait for him"
1510,III,"there. This cruise of his is like to cost him dear."""
1511,III,
1512,III,"The plan was highly approved, and the whole body rose and entered the"
1513,III,"house together, resolved to act at once on the advice of Antinous."
1514,III,"Before long news of their wicked designs came to the ears of Penelope,"
1515,III,who was still ignorant of her son's departure; for Eurycleia had kept
1516,III,"her counsel well. The evil tidings were brought by Medon, a servant in"
1517,III,"the house of Odysseus, who had overheard the suitors plotting"
1518,III,"together, while he stood concealed behind a buttress of the courtyard"
1519,III,"fence. Without delay he went in search of Penelope, whom he found"
1520,III,sitting with her handmaids in her chamber. As soon as he appeared on
1521,III,"the threshold Penelope looked at him reproachfully, and said: ""What"
1522,III,message bringest thou from thy fair masters? Is it their pleasure that
1523,III,my maidens should leave their tasks and spread the board for them? Out
1524,III,on your feasting and your wooing! May this be the last morsel that ye
1525,III,"ever taste! Ungrateful men, have ye forgotten all the good deeds that"
1526,III,"were wrought here by the hands of Odysseus, and all the kindness that"
1527,III,"ye received from him? Yes, all is forgotten; ye have no thought in"
1528,III,"your hearts but to grow fat at his cost, and devour his living."""
1529,III,
1530,III,"""Alas! lady,"" answered Medon, ""would that this were the worst! But I"
1531,III,am the bearer of heavier news than this. Telemachus has sailed to
1532,III,"Pylos, to inquire concerning his father, and the suitors have plotted"
1533,III,"to slay him on his way home."" Having delivered his message, Medon left"
1534,III,"the chamber, and the door was shut."
1535,III,
1536,III,"Long Penelope sat without a word, struck dumb by this cruel blow."
1537,III,"Then, as if seized by a sudden thought, she rose from her seat, and"
1538,III,took two paces towards the door. But her strength failing her she
1539,III,"tottered backward, and sank down upon the ground, leaning against the"
1540,III,"wall. Her handmaids gathered round her, and would have lifted her up,"
1541,III,but she waved them off and at last gave utterance to her feelings in
1542,III,wailing and broken tones:
1543,III,
1544,III,"""Woeful beyond the lot of all women on earth is my portion! First, I"
1545,III,"lost my lion-hearted lord, rich in every excellent gift, a hero among"
1546,III,"heroes; and now the powers of the air[1] have carried off my child, my"
1547,III,"well-beloved, without one word of farewell. Hearts of stone, why did"
1548,III,ye not tell me of his going? Had I known his purpose I would have
1549,III,"prevailed on him to stay, or he must have left me dead in these halls."
1550,III,"Go, one of you, and call Dolius, the keeper of my garden and orchard,"
1551,III,"and send him to tell all to Laertes, if haply he may devise some way"
1552,III,"to turn the hearts of the people, and save his race from being utterly"
1553,III,"cut off."""
1554,III,
1555,III,"[Footnote 1: Demons, to whom sudden disappearance was attributed.]"
1556,III,
1557,III,"""Sweet lady,"" answered Eurycleia, who was sitting among the women, ""I"
1558,III,"will tell thee all the truth, and then thou shalt slay me, if it be"
1559,III,"thy will. I was privy to this journey, and Telemachus made me swear a"
1560,III,"solemn oath not to reveal it to thee until twelve days were passed, or"
1561,III,thou hadst heard of it from others. For he feared that thou wouldst
1562,III,waste thy fair cheeks with weeping. But be not cast down; I am sure
1563,III,"that the gods hate not so utterly the house of Odysseus, nor purpose"
1564,III,"to destroy it altogether. Vex not the old man Laertes in his sorrow,"
1565,III,"but go wash thyself, put on clean raiment, and go up and pray to"
1566,III,"Athene in thy upper chamber to guard and keep thy son from harm."""
1567,III,
1568,III,"Then Penelope was comforted, and dried her tears, and went up with her"
1569,III,handmaids to the upper chamber. There she made her offering before the
1570,III,"shrine of Athene, and lifted up her voice in prayer: ""Daughter of"
1571,III,"Zeus, stern warrior maiden, if ever my lord Odysseus offered"
1572,III,"acceptable sacrifice to thee, remember now his service, save my son,"
1573,III,"and let not the wooers work evil against him."" When her prayer was"
1574,III,"ended the women joined their voices with hers, and called again and"
1575,III,"again on the awful name of Athene. After that they left her, and she"
1576,III,"sank down on a couch, exhausted by her emotions, and full of anxious"
1577,III,"thought. At length she ceased her weary tossing, and fell into a quiet"
1578,III,and refreshing sleep.
1579,III,
1580,III,"Athene had heard her prayer, and being full of pity for the sorely"
1581,III,tried lady she resolved to find means to soothe her troubled spirit.
1582,III,"So she made a phantom, like in form and in feature to Iphthime, a"
1583,III,"sister of Penelope, who lived with her husband in distant Pheræ. And"
1584,III,"the phantom came to the house of Penelope, and entering her chamber by"
1585,III,"the keyhole, stood by her bedside and spake to her thus: ""Sorrow not"
1586,III,"at all, nor vex thy soul for the sake of Telemachus. The gods love thy"
1587,III,"son, and will bring him safe home."""
1588,III,
1589,III,"Then wise Penelope made answer, slumbering right sweetly at the gates"
1590,III,"of dreams: ""Dear sister, what has brought thee hither from thy far"
1591,III,"distant home? Thou biddest me take comfort, but my heart is torn with"
1592,III,"fear and grief for my brave lord, and yet more for Telemachus, who is"
1593,III,"encompassed with perils by sea and by land."" ""Fear nothing,"" answered"
1594,III,"the dim phantom. ""He has a mighty helper by his side, even Pallas"
1595,III,"Athene, who sent me hither to strengthen and console thee."" With that"
1596,III,"the ghostly visitor vanished as it came, and left Penelope much"
1597,III,cheered by the clear vision which had brought her words of healing at
1598,III,the blackest hour of the night.
1599,III,
1600,III,Meanwhile Antinous had taken steps to carry out his villainous design.
1601,III,"At nightfall he went down to the sea with twenty picked men, boarded"
1602,III,"the vessel which had been prepared for their use, and sailed out to a"
1603,III,little island which lies in the middle of the strait between Samos and
1604,III,"Ithaca. There they anchored in a sheltered bay, and waited for the"
1605,III,coming of Telemachus.
1606,III,
1607,III,
1608,III,
1609,III,
1610,III,Odysseus and Calypso
1611,III,
1612,III,
1613,I,I
1614,I,
1615,I,"We have waited long for the appearance of Odysseus, and at last he is"
1616,I,"about to enter the scene, which he will never leave again until the"
1617,I,final act of the great drama is played out. Hitherto he has been
1618,I,"pursued by the malice of Poseidon, who wrecked his fleet, drowned all"
1619,I,"his men, and kept him confined for seven years in Calypso's island, in"
1620,I,vengeance for the blinding of his son Polyphemus.
1621,I,
1622,I,"But now the prayers of Athene have prevailed, and Hermes, the"
1623,I,"messenger of the gods, is on his way from Olympus, bearing a"
1624,I,peremptory summons to Calypso to let Odysseus depart. Shod with his
1625,I,"golden, winged sandals, which bear him, swift as the wind, over moist"
1626,I,"and dry, and holding in his hand his magic wand, Hermes skimmed like a"
1627,I,"seagull over the blue waters of the Ægæan, until he came to that far"
1628,I,"distant isle. Arrived there, he went straight to the great cavern"
1629,I,"where Calypso dwelt; and he found her there, walking about her room,"
1630,I,"weaving with a golden shuttle, and singing sweetly at her work. A"
1631,I,"great fire was blazing on the hearth, sending forth a sweet odour of"
1632,I,cedar and sandal-wood. Round about the cavern grew a little wood of
1633,I,"blossoming trees, ""alder and poplar tall, and cypress sweet of smell"";"
1634,I,and there owls and hawks and cormorants built their nests. Over the
1635,I,"threshold was trained a wide-branching vine, with many a purple"
1636,I,cluster and wealth of rustling leaves. Four springs of clear water
1637,I,"welled up before the cave, and wandered down to the meadows where the"
1638,I,"violet and parsley grew. It was a choice and cool retreat, meet"
1639,I,dwelling for a lovely nymph.
1640,I,
1641,I,"Calypso greeted her visitor kindly, bade him be seated, and set nectar"
1642,I,"and ambrosia before him. And when he had refreshed himself, he told"
1643,I,"his message. ""I bear the commands of Zeus,"" he said, ""and to do his"
1644,I,high will have I travelled this long and weary way. It is said that
1645,I,"thou keepest with thee a man of many woes, who has suffered more than"
1646,I,any of those who fought at Troy. Him thou art commanded to send away
1647,I,from thee with all speed; for it is not destined for him to end his
1648,I,"days here, but the hour has come when he must go back to his home and"
1649,I,"country, Zeus has spoken, and thou must obey."""
1650,I,
1651,I,"This was bitter news to Calypso, for she loved Odysseus, and would"
1652,I,"have made him immortal, that he might abide with her for ever. She"
1653,I,"wrung her hands, and said in a mournful voice: ""Now I know of a truth"
1654,I,"that the gods are a jealous race, and will not suffer one of their"
1655,I,kind to wed with a mortal mate. Therefore Orion fell by the unseen
1656,I,"arrows of Artemis, when fair Aurora chose him for her lord; and"
1657,I,"therefore Zeus slew Iasion with his lightning, because he was loved of"
1658,I,Demeter. Is not Odysseus mine? Did I not save him and cherish him when
1659,I,he was flung naked and helpless on these shores? But since no other
1660,I,"deity may evade or frustrate the will of Zeus, let him go, and I will"
1661,I,"show him how he may reach his own country without scathe."""
1662,I,
1663,I,"When he had heard Calypso's answer, Hermes took leave of her, and"
1664,I,"returned to Olympus, and the nymph went down to the part of the shore"
1665,I,where she knew Odysseus was accustomed to sit. There he would remain
1666,I,"all day, gazing tearfully over the barren waste of waters, and wearing"
1667,I,out his soul with ceaseless lamentation. For he had long grown weary
1668,I,"of his soft slavery in Calypso's cave, and yearned with exceeding"
1669,I,"great desire for the familiar hills of Ithaca, so rugged, but so dear."
1670,I,"And there Calypso found him now, sitting on a rock with dejected mien."
1671,I,"She sat down at his side, and said: ""A truce to thy complaints, thou"
1672,I,man of woes! Thou hast thy wish; I will let thee go with all
1673,I,"good-will, and I will show thee how to build a broad raft, which"
1674,I,shall bear thee across the misty deep. I will victual her with corn
1675,I,"and wine, and clothe thee in new garments, and send a breeze behind"
1676,I,"thee to waft thee safe. Thus am I commanded by the gods, whose"
1677,I,"dwelling is in the wide heaven, and their will I do. Up now and fell"
1678,I,"me yon tall trees for timber to make the raft."""
1679,I,
1680,I,"Odysseus was by nature a very shrewd and cautious man, and he feared"
1681,I,"that Calypso was contriving some mischief against him, in revenge for"
1682,I,"his coldness. He looked at her doubtfully, and answered: ""I fear thee,"
1683,I,"nymph, and I mistrust thy purpose. How shall a man cross this dreadful"
1684,I,"gulf, where no ship is ever seen, on a raft? And though that were"
1685,I,"possible, I will never leave thee against thy will. Swear to me now"
1686,I,"that thou intendest me no harm."""
1687,I,
1688,I,"Calypso smiled at his suspicions, and patted him on the shoulder as"
1689,I,"she answered: ""Thou art a sad rogue, and very deep of wit, as anyone"
1690,I,"may see by these words of thine. Now hear me swear: Witness, thou"
1691,I,"earth, and the wide heaven above us, and the dark waterfall of Styx,"
1692,I,"the greatest and most awful thing by which a god may swear, that I"
1693,I,"intend no ill, but only good, to this man."""
1694,I,
1695,I,"Having sworn that oath Calypso rose, and bidding Odysseus follow led"
1696,I,"the way to her cave. There she set meat before him, such as mortal men"
1697,I,"eat, and wine to drink; but she herself was served by her handmaids"
1698,I,"with immortal food, and nectar, the wine of the gods. When they had"
1699,I,"supped, Calypso looked at Odysseus and said: ""And wilt thou indeed"
1700,I,"leave me, thou strange man? Am I not tall and fair, and worthy to be"
1701,I,"called a daughter of heaven? And is thy Penelope so rare a dame, that"
1702,I,thou preferrest her to me! Ah! if thou knewest all the toils which
1703,I,"await thee before thou reachest thy home, and all the perils prepared"
1704,I,"for thee there, thou wouldst renounce thy purpose, and dwell for ever"
1705,I,"with me. Nevertheless go, if go thou must, and my blessing go with"
1706,I,"thee."""
1707,I,
1708,I,"Her words were kind, but some anger lurked in her tone, which Odysseus"
1709,I,"hastened to appease. ""Fair goddess,"" he answered, ""be not wroth with"
1710,I,me. I know that thou art more lovely far than my wife Penelope; for
1711,I,"thou art divine, and she is but a mortal woman. Nevertheless I long"
1712,I,"day and night to see her face, and to sit beneath the shadow of my own"
1713,I,rooftree. And if I be stricken again by the hand of Heaven on the
1714,I,"purple sea, I will bear it, for I have a very patient heart. Long have"
1715,I,"I toiled, and much have I suffered, amid waves and wars. If more"
1716,I,"remains, I will endure that also."""
1717,I,
1718,II,II
1719,II,
1720,II,"At early dawn, when the eastern wave was just silvered by the dim"
1721,II,"light, Calypso roused Odysseus, and equipped him for the task of the"
1722,II,"day. First she gave him a weighty two-edged axe, well balanced on its"
1723,II,"haft of olive-wood, and an adze, freshly ground; then she showed him"
1724,II,"where the tall trees grew, and bade him fall to work with the axe."
1725,II,"Twenty great trees fell beneath his sturdy strokes, and he trimmed the"
1726,II,"trunks with the axe, and stripped off the bark. Meanwhile Calypso had"
1727,II,"brought him an augur, and he bored the timbers, and fitted them"
1728,II,"together, and fastened them with bolts and cross-pieces. So the raft"
1729,II,"grew under his hands, broad as the floor of a stout merchantship. And"
1730,II,"he fenced her with bulwarks, piling up blocks of wood to steady them."
1731,II,Last of all he made mast and sail and rigging; and when all was ready
1732,II,he thrust the frail vessel with rollers and levers down to the sea.
1733,II,
1734,II,Four times the sun had risen and set before his labour was ended; and
1735,II,"on the fifth day Calypso brought him provisions for the voyage, a"
1736,II,"great goatskin bottle full of water, and a smaller one of wine, and a"
1737,II,"sack of corn, with other choice viands as a relish to his bread."
1738,II,
1739,II,"A joyful man was Odysseus when he spread his sail, and took his place"
1740,II,"at the helm, and waved a last farewell to his gentle friend. A fair"
1741,II,"breeze wafted him swiftly from the shore, and ere long that lovely"
1742,II,"island, at once his home and his prison for seven long years, became a"
1743,II,"mere shadow in the distance. All night he sat sleepless, tiller in"
1744,II,"hand, watching the pilot stars, the Pleiades, and Boötes, and the"
1745,II,"Bear, named also the Wain, which turns on one spot, and watches Orion,"
1746,II,and never dips into the ocean stream. For the goddess Calypso had
1747,II,bidden him keep that star on the left hand as he sailed the seas. Thus
1748,II,"he voyaged for seventeen days, and on the eighteenth he saw afar off,"
1749,II,"dimly outlined, a range of hills, rising, like the back of a shield,"
1750,II,above the horizon's verge.
1751,II,
1752,II,"Now Poseidon, his great enemy, had been absent for many days on a far"
1753,II,"journey, and thus had taken no part in the council at Olympus when"
1754,II,Zeus had issued his order for the release of Odysseus. Just at this
1755,II,"time he was on his way back to Olympus, and caught sight of the bold"
1756,II,"voyager steering towards the nearest land. ""Ha! art thou there?"" said"
1757,II,"the implacable god, shaking his head; ""and have the other powers"
1758,II,"plotted against me in my absence, to frustrate my just anger? Thy"
1759,II,"wanderings are well-nigh over, poor wretch! But thou shalt taste once"
1760,II,"more of my vengeance, before thou reachest yonder shore."""
1761,II,
1762,II,So saying the lord of ocean took his trident and stirred up the deep;
1763,II,"and the clouds came trooping at his call, covering the sky with a"
1764,II,"black curtain. Soon a great tempest broke loose, blowing in violent"
1765,II,and fitful blasts from all the four quarters of heaven. Then pale fear
1766,II,"got hold of Odysseus, as he saw the great curling billows heaving"
1767,II,"round his frail craft. ""Woe is me!"" he cried, ""when shall my troubles"
1768,II,"have an end? Surely the goddess spoke truth, when she foretold me that"
1769,II,"I should perish amid the waves, and never see my home again. Here I"
1770,II,"lie helpless, given over to destruction, the sport of all the winds of"
1771,II,"heaven. Happy, thrice happy, were my comrades who fell fighting"
1772,II,bravely and found honourable burial in the soil of Troy! Would that I
1773,II,had died on that great day when the battle raged fiercest over the
1774,II,"body of Pelides; then should I have found death with honour, but now I"
1775,II,"am doomed to a miserable and dishonoured end."""
1776,II,
1777,II,The words were hardly uttered when a huge toppling wave struck the
1778,II,"raft with tremendous force, carrying away mast and sail, and hurling"
1779,II,"Odysseus into the sea. Deep down he sank, and the waters darkened over"
1780,II,"his head, for he was encumbered by the weight of his clothes. At last"
1781,II,"he rose to the surface, gasping, and spitting out the brine, and"
1782,II,"though sore spent, he swam towards the raft, and hauled himself on"
1783,II,"board. There he sat clinging to the dismasted and rudderless vessel,"
1784,II,"which was tossed to and fro from wave to wave, as the winds of autumn"
1785,II,sport with the light thistledown and drive it hither and thither.
1786,II,
1787,II,"But help was at hand. There was a certain ocean nymph, named Ino,"
1788,II,"daughter of Cadmus, who had once been a mortal woman, but now was"
1789,II,"numbered among the immortal powers. She saw and pitied Odysseus, and"
1790,II,"boarding the raft addressed him in this wise: ""Poor man, why is"
1791,II,Poseidon so wroth with thee that he maltreats thee thus? Yet shall he
1792,II,"not destroy thee, for all his malice. Only do as I bid thee, and thou"
1793,II,"shalt get safely to land: take this veil, and when thou hast stripped"
1794,II,"off thy garments, bind it across thy breast. Then leave the raft to"
1795,II,"its fate, and swim manfully to land; and when thou art safe fling the"
1796,II,"veil back into the sea, and go thy way."""
1797,II,
1798,II,"So saying the goddess sank beneath the waves, leaving Odysseus with"
1799,II,her veil in his hand. But that cautious veteran did not at once act on
1800,II,"her advice, for he feared that some treachery was intended against"
1801,II,him. He resolved therefore to remain on the raft as long as her
1802,II,"timbers held together, and only to have recourse to the veil in the"
1803,II,last extremity.
1804,II,
1805,II,"He had just taken this prudent resolution, when another wave, more"
1806,II,"huge than the last, thundered down on the raft, scattering her"
1807,II,"timbers, as the wind scatters a heap of chaff. Odysseus clung fast to"
1808,II,"one beam and, mounting it, sat astride as on a horse, until he had"
1809,II,"stripped off his clothes. Then he bound the veil round him, flung"
1810,II,"himself head foremost into the billows, and swam lustily towards land."
1811,II,
1812,II,"The storm was now subsiding, and a steady breeze succeeded, blowing"
1813,II,"from the north, which helped that much-tried hero in his struggle for"
1814,II,"life. Yet for two days and two nights he battled with the waves, and"
1815,II,when day broke on the third day he found himself close under a
1816,II,"frowning wall of cliffs, at whose foot the sea was breaking with a"
1817,II,"noise like thunder. Odysseus ceased swimming, and trod the water,"
1818,II,looking anxiously round for an opening in the cliffs where he might
1819,II,"land. While he hesitated, a great foaming wave came rushing landward,"
1820,II,threatening to sweep him against that rugged shore; but Odysseus saw
1821,II,"his danger in time, and succeeded in gaining a rocky mass which stood"
1822,II,"above the surface just before him, and clutching it with hands and"
1823,II,"knees, contrived to keep his hold until the huge billow was past. In"
1824,II,"another moment he was caught by the recoil of the wave, and flung back"
1825,II,"into the boiling surf, with fingers torn and bleeding. With desperate"
1826,II,"exertions he fought his way out into the comparatively calm water,"
1827,II,"outside the line of breakers, and swam parallel to the shore, until he"
1828,II,"saw with delight a sheltered inlet, whence a river flowed into the"
1829,II,"sea. Murmuring a prayer to the god of the river he steered for land,"
1830,II,"and a few strokes brought him to a smooth sandy beach, where he lay"
1831,II,for a long time without sense or motion. All his flesh was swollen by
1832,II,"his long immersion in the water, the skin was stripped from his hands,"
1833,II,and when his breath came back to him he felt as weak as a child. Then
1834,II,"a deadly nausea came over him, and the water which he had swallowed"
1835,II,"gushed up through his mouth and nostrils. Somewhat relieved by this,"
1836,II,"he rose to his feet, and tottering to the river's brink loosed the"
1837,II,"veil from his waist, and dropped it into the flowing water. For he"
1838,II,"remembered the request of Ino, to whom he owed his life."
1839,II,
1840,II,He had indeed escaped the sea; but his position seemed almost
1841,II,"hopeless. There he lay, naked, and more dead than alive, without food"
1842,II,"or shelter, in a strange land, without a sign of human habitation in"
1843,II,view. Crawling painfully to a bed of rushes he lay down and considered
1844,II,"what was best for him to do. He could not remain where he was, for it"
1845,II,"was an exposed place, with no protection from the dew, and open to the"
1846,II,"chill breeze from the river, which blows at early dawn. A few hours of"
1847,II,"such a vigil would certainly kill him in his exhausted state. If, on"
1848,II,"the other hand, he sought the shelter of the woods, he feared that he"
1849,II,would fall a prey to some prowling beast.
1850,II,
1851,II,"At last he determined to face the less certain peril, and made his way"
1852,II,into a thicket not far from the river side. Searching for a place
1853,II,"where he might lie he soon came upon two dense bushes of olive, whose"
1854,II,leaves and branches were so closely interwoven that they formed a sort
1855,II,"of natural arbour, impenetrable by sun, or rain, or wind. ""In good"
1856,II,"time!"" murmured Odysseus, as he crept beneath that green roof, and"
1857,II,scooped out a deep bed for himself in the fallen leaves. There he lay
1858,II,"down, and piled the leaves high over him. And as a careful housewife"
1859,II,"in some remote farmhouse, where there are no neighbours near, covers"
1860,II,"up a burning brand among the ashes, so that it may last all night, and"
1861,II,"preserve the seed of fire; so lay Odysseus, nursing the spark of life,"
1862,II,in his deep bed of leaves. And soon he forgot all his troubles in a
1863,II,deep and dreamless sleep.

1871,I,I
1872,I,
1873,I,The land on which Odysseus had thus been cast like a piece of broken
1874,I,"wreckage was called Phæacia, and derived its name from the Phæacians,"
1875,I,"a race of famous mariners, who had settled there some fifty years"
1876,I,"before, having been driven from their former seat by the Cyclopes, a"
1877,I,"savage tribe, who dwelt on their borders. The Phæacians were an"
1878,I,"unwarlike people, and being in no condition to resist the fierce"
1879,I,"assaults of these lawless neighbours, they abandoned their homes and"
1880,I,"built a new city on a little peninsula, connected with the mainland by"
1881,I,a narrow isthmus. Defended by strong walls they were now safe against
1882,I,"all attacks, and they soon grew rich and prosperous in the exercise of"
1883,I,a thriving trade.
1884,I,
1885,I,"At this time the king of the Phæacians was Alcinous, who had a fair"
1886,I,"daughter, named Nausicaä. On the night when Odysseus lay couched in"
1887,I,"his bed of leaves Nausicaä was sleeping in her bower, and with her"
1888,I,"were two handmaids, whose beds were set on either side of the door."
1889,I,"And in a dream she seemed to hear one of her girlish friends, the"
1890,I,"daughter of a neighbouring house, speaking to her thus: ""Nausicaä, why"
1891,I,art thou grown so careless as to suffer all the raiment in thy
1892,I,"father's house to remain unwashen, when thy bridal day is so near?"
1893,I,"Wouldst thou be wedded in soiled attire, and have all thy friends clad"
1894,I,"unseemly, to put thee to shame? These are a woman's cares, by which"
1895,I,"she wins a good report among men, and gladdens her mother's heart."
1896,I,"Arise, therefore, at break of day, and beg thy father to let harness"
1897,I,"the mules to the wain, that thou mayest take the linen to the place of"
1898,I,"washing, far away by the river's side. I will go with thee, and help"
1899,I,"thee in the work."""
1900,I,
1901,I,"So dreamed Nausicaä, and so spake the vision. But the voice which"
1902,I,seemed the voice of her friend came from no mortal lips; it was Athene
1903,I,"herself who had visited the maiden's bower, in her care for Odysseus,"
1904,I,that he might get safe conduct to the city of the Phæacians. And when
1905,I,"she had done her errand the goddess went back to Olympus, where is the"
1906,I,"steadfast, everlasting seat of the blessed gods, not shaken of any"
1907,I,"wind, nor wet with rain, nor chilled by snow, but steeped for ever in"
1908,I,"cloudless, sunny air. There the gods abide for ever and take their"
1909,I,delight.
1910,I,
1911,I,"Nausicaä rose betimes, with her mind full of the dream, and went down"
1912,I,"to the hall, where she found her mother sitting by the hearth with her"
1913,I,"women, spinning the bright sea-purple thread. Inquiring for her father"
1914,I,she learnt that he had but that moment gone forth to attend the
1915,I,"council of elders, and hastening after him she found him before the"
1916,I,doors of the house.
1917,I,
1918,I,"""Father,"" she said, ""may I have the waggon to take the household"
1919,I,raiment to the place of washing? Thou thyself hast ever need of clean
1920,I,"garments when thou goest to the council, and my brothers will reproach"
1921,I,"me if they lack clean raiment when they go to the dance."""
1922,I,
1923,I,"Thus spake the maiden, being ashamed to make mention of her own"
1924,I,"marriage. But Alcinous knew, and smiled to himself, as he ordered his"
1925,I,"thralls to prepare the waggon. So when they had harnessed the mules,"
1926,I,"Nausicaä and her handmaids brought the soiled garments, and bestowed"
1927,I,them behind the seat. And her mother brought a basket with food for
1928,I,the midday meal and oil for her daughter and the other maidens when
1929,I,"they took their bath. Then they took their seats, Nausicaä grasped the"
1930,I,"reins, and they went off at a sharp trot towards the riverside."
1931,I,
1932,I,"After a pleasant drive, they came to the place where stood a row of"
1933,I,"cisterns on the river's bank. There they unharnessed the mules, and"
1934,I,left them to crop the sweet clover in the water-meadows. Then they
1935,I,"unloaded the waggon, threw the garments into washing-troughs, and trod"
1936,I,"them with their feet until they were thoroughly cleansed, and having"
1937,I,"wrung them out, they spread them on the white pebbly beach to dry."
1938,I,"While the garments were bleaching in the wholesome sun and air, they"
1939,I,"took their bath, and afterwards sat down to the midday meal. When that"
1940,I,"was ended, they threw off their veils, and stood up to play at ball."
1941,I,
1942,I,"It was a pretty and graceful sight; they were all comely maidens,"
1943,I,glowing with youth and health. Their sport was accompanied by dance
1944,I,"and song, and as they chased the flying ball, keeping time with hand"
1945,I,"and foot and voice, they seemed like a choir of mountain nymphs, led"
1946,I,"by Artemis, when she goes forth to the chase, in the wild valleys of"
1947,I,"Arcady or Lacedæmon. Tallest and fairest of them all was Nausicaä, who"
1948,I,"led the sport, moving like a queen among her vassals."
1949,I,
1950,I,"Presently they grew tired of their sport, and Nausicaä flung the ball"
1951,I,"for the last time to one of her handmaids. The girl missed the ball,"
1952,I,"and it fell into the middle of the river, whereupon the whole company"
1953,I,"set up a sharp cry. The sound came to the ears of Odysseus, and woke"
1954,I,him from his long slumber. He sat up in his bed of leaves and communed
1955,I,"with himself: ""Behold I hear the shrill cry of women, or perhaps of"
1956,I,the nymphs who haunt this wild place. Now may I learn of what sort are
1957,I,"the natives of this land, whether they be fierce and inhospitable, or"
1958,I,"gentle and kind to strangers."" Plucking a leafy bough, and holding it"
1959,I,"before him to cover himself, he stepped forth from the thicket, and"
1960,I,"came in sight of that gentle company. Grim and dreadful he looked,"
1961,I,"like a hungry lion, buffeted by rain and wind, who goes forth in a"
1962,I,"tempest to seek his prey; for he was haggard with long fasting, and"
1963,I,sore disfigured by his battle with the sea; his eyes glared with
1964,I,"famine, and his hair and beard hung ragged and unkempt about his face."
1965,I,At this fearful apparition the maidens fled shrieking along the river
1966,I,"bank, all but Nausicaä, who stood her ground, and gazed fearlessly,"
1967,I,"though in wonder, while Odysseus came slowly forward. When he was"
1968,I,"still some way off he stopped, fearing to offend her delicacy if he"
1969,I,"came nearer. Then with a gesture of entreaty he began to speak, and"
1970,I,Nausicaä knew at once that it was no common man who stood before her.
1971,I,
1972,I,"""Have pity on me, O queen!"" he began, in soft and insinuating tones."
1973,I,"""Art thou a goddess, or a mortal woman? If thou art a goddess, thou"
1974,I,"seemest to me most like to Artemis, daughter of great Zeus, both in"
1975,I,"face, and in stature, and in form. But if thou art mortal, then thrice"
1976,I,"blessed are thy father and mother, and thrice blessed thy brethren,"
1977,I,"and their spirits are refreshed because of thee, when thou goest, a"
1978,I,"very rose of beauty, to the dance. Happy the man who wins thee for his"
1979,I,bride! Never yet have I seen the like of thee among all the children
1980,I,"of men. Only once have I beheld aught to compare unto thee, a young"
1981,I,palm-tree which I saw growing tall and straight by the altar of Apollo
1982,I,"at Delos. I saw it, and was amazed, for it was wondrous fair; and even"
1983,I,"so is my soul filled with wonder and dread when I look upon thy face,"
1984,I,"so that I am afraid to draw near unto thee, though sore is my need."
1985,I,"Yesterday I was flung naked on thy coast, after a voyage of twenty"
1986,I,"days. Many things have I suffered, and more, I ween, remains for me in"
1987,I,"store; for I am a man of many woes. Have compassion on me, dread lady!"
1988,I,"I am thy suppliant, and to thee first I address my prayer. Show me the"
1989,I,"way to the city, and give me a cloth to wrap round me, that I may go"
1990,I,"among the people without shame. And may the gods give thee all,"
1991,I,"whatsoever thy heart desireth, a husband and a home, and happy wedded"
1992,I,"love, shedding warmth in thine house, and a strong defence against all"
1993,I,"ills from without, but above all a sacred treasure in thy husband's"
1994,I,"heart, and in thine."""
1995,I,
1996,I,"""Whatever be thy misfortunes,"" answered Nausicaä, ""I am sure they are"
1997,I,not the fruit of thine own folly or wickedness. And since thou art
1998,I,"come as a suppliant to this land of ours, thou shalt want nothing,"
1999,I,"whether it be raiment, or aught else that befits thy state. I will"
2000,I,"show thee our city, and tell thee the name of the people. Know that"
2001,I,"thou hast come to the country of the Phæacians, whose ruler and king"
2002,I,"is Alcinous, and I am his daughter."""
2003,I,
2004,I,"Then she called to her handmaids, who were looking on, half"
2005,I,"frightened, half curious, from behind rocks and trees, a long way off,"
2006,I,"ready to resume their flight at the slightest alarm: ""Come hither, and"
2007,I,fear not the man; neither he nor any other shall ever come to this
2008,I,land with thoughts of harm; for we are very dear to the immortal gods.
2009,I,"Far away we dwell amidst the rolling seas, remote from the haunts of"
2010,I,"men. But this is some hapless wanderer, driven by chance to our"
2011,I,"shores, and we must cherish him, for from Zeus come all strangers and"
2012,I,"beggars, and a little gift is a great thing to them. Take the stranger"
2013,I,"to a sheltered place, where he may wash and dress him, and give him"
2014,I,"wherewithal to clothe himself, and after that, meat and drink."""
2015,I,
2016,I,When they heard the words of their mistress the girls came stealing
2017,I,"timidly back, one by one. And they gave Odysseus clean raiment, and"
2018,I,"when he had washed and clothed himself, he came back to the place"
2019,I,where Nausicaä was waiting. Wonderful was the change which had been
2020,I,made in his appearance by the refreshing bath and fitting apparel.
2021,I,"Instead of the squalid, battered wretch who had begged for countenance"
2022,I,"and shelter, Nausicaä saw before her a stalwart, stately man,"
2023,I,"broad-shouldered, and deep of chest, with dark clustering hair and"
2024,I,"beard, like the curling hyacinth, and an air of majesty and command."
2025,I,
2026,I,"""Hear me, friends,"" whispered Nausicaä, as she saw him coming,"
2027,I,"""methinks some god hath wrought a miracle on this man, who but now was"
2028,I,so hideous to behold. Would that we might prevail with him to make his
2029,I,abode among us! She would be a proud maiden who should wed with such
2030,I,"as him. Now give the stranger food and drink."" And they did so, and"
2031,I,"Odysseus ate and drank with keen appetite, having tasted nothing for"
2032,I,"many days. While he was eating, the maidens folded the garments and"
2033,I,"placed them in the waggon, and when he had finished, Nausicaä mounted"
2034,I,"the waggon, and bidding him and the handmaids follow on foot started"
2035,I,the mules and drove slowly towards the city. When they reached the
2036,I,"cultivated lands outside the walls she drew up, and addressed Odysseus"
2037,I,"thus: ""Stranger, I may not go with thee further, for I fear the"
2038,I,"envious tongues of the citizens, who will point the finger at us and"
2039,I,say: 'See what a tall and handsome stranger Nausicaä hath brought with
2040,I,her!--some seafaring man whom she hath brought with her to be her
2041,I,"husband, since she despises the men of her own nation.' And this will"
2042,I,"be a reproach unto me. Therefore wait thou awhile, and do as I bid"
2043,I,"thee. Not far from here is a temple and grove of Athene, a fair"
2044,I,"coppice of poplar-trees, and a spring of clear water. Go thou thither,"
2045,I,"and wait until we have time to reach my father's house, then rise and"
2046,I,go into the city and inquire for the dwelling of Alcinous. A little
2047,I,"child could show thee the way, for there is none like it in all the"
2048,I,"city."""
2049,I,
2050,I,[Illustration: Odysseus and Nausicaä]
2051,I,
2052,I,"So saying, Nausicaä drove on, leaving Odysseus where he was. He soon"
2053,I,"found the temple, and going in knelt down and prayed to the goddess to"
2054,I,continue her favour. When he thought that Nausicaä had had time to
2055,I,"reach home, he rose and went into the city. The road lay along a"
2056,I,"narrow causeway, which connected the city with the mainland, and on"
2057,I,"either side was a sheltered haven, with ships drawn up on the beach."
2058,I,"Passing through the gates he came next to the place of assembly, in"
2059,I,"front of a temple of Poseidon, with a circle of massive stones bedded"
2060,I,deeply in the earth. Wherever he looked he saw signs of a busy
2061,I,"seafaring people--masts, and oars, and great coils of rope--and his"
2062,I,ears were filled with the sound of saw and hammer from the
2063,I,shipwrights' yards.
2064,I,
2065,II,II
2066,II,
2067,II,"As he stood thus gazing about him, he saw a young maiden coming"
2068,II,"towards him, carrying a pitcher. He inquired of her the way to the"
2069,II,"house of Alcinous, and she bade him follow her, as she was going that"
2070,II,"way. ""My father's house,"" she said, ""is close to the house which thou"
2071,II,"seekest. But thou art a stranger, I perceive, and not of this land;"
2072,II,"walk therefore warily, and regard no man, for the Phæacians love not"
2073,II,"the face of the stranger, nor are they given to hospitality. Their"
2074,II,"home is the deep, and their ships are as swift as a bird--swift as a"
2075,II,"thought--for they are the favourites of Poseidon."""
2076,II,
2077,II,"So saying, the maiden led the way swiftly, and Odysseus followed,"
2078,II,keeping close behind. He remarked with wonder that though the streets
2079,II,"were full of people, so that they had to walk carefully, and thread"
2080,II,"their way through the crowd, none seemed to notice him or his"
2081,II,"companion, or gave any sign of being conscious of their presence. The"
2082,II,truth was that the supposed maiden was none other than his patron
2083,II,"goddess Athene, who so ordered it that he was invisible to all eyes"
2084,II,but hers.
2085,II,
2086,II,"As they went, his companion entertained him with an account of the"
2087,II,"family history of the Phæacian king, Alcinous, whose father,"
2088,II,"Nausithous, was the son of Poseidon. Alcinous married Arete, who was"
2089,II,"related to him by blood, and was honoured exceedingly by her husband"
2090,II,"and by all the Phæacians. ""She is the idol of her household,"""
2091,II,"continued the maiden, ""and all eyes follow her with love and reverence"
2092,II,when she goes through the town. So high is her character that even men
2093,II,"consult her in their differences, and defer to her judgment. If thou"
2094,II,"canst enlist her on thy side, thou wilt soon obtain the safe conduct"
2095,II,"which thou desirest, and reach thy home in safety and honour."""
2096,II,
2097,II,"They had now reached a large enclosed piece of land, surrounded by a"
2098,II,"tall fence, above which appeared the boughs of goodly trees, laden"
2099,II,"with their burden of fruit. ""Here is the garden of Alcinous,"""
2100,II,"whispered the maiden, ""and yonder is the gate. Enter boldly in, and"
2101,II,"seek out the queen, who is now sitting at meat with her husband's"
2102,II,"guests. Make thy petition to her, for if her heart incline unto thee"
2103,II,"all will be well."""
2104,II,
2105,II,"With that word she vanished from his sight, and left him standing at"
2106,II,"the gates of Alcinous. Wondering greatly he entered the garden, and"
2107,II,gazed about him. So fair a sight had never met his eyes. Fruit-trees
2108,II,"without number stood ranged in ordered rows, pear-trees, and"
2109,II,"pomegranates, and rosy apples, the luscious fig, and olives in their"
2110,II,"bloom. Their fruit never failed, summer or winter, all the year round."
2111,II,"There blows the warm west wind without ceasing, nursing the tender"
2112,II,"blossom, and mellowing the swelling fruit. He saw pears and figs"
2113,II,hanging on the trees in every stage of growth. Another part of the
2114,II,enclosure was set apart for the cultivation of the vine; and here also
2115,II,"the same wonder was to be seen, springtime and summer dancing"
2116,II,"hand-in-hand, and yellow autumn treading close in their footsteps."
2117,II,"Side by side hung the ripe, purple cluster, the crude grape just"
2118,II,"turning from green to red, and tiny green bunches lately formed from"
2119,II,"the blossom. There the labour of the vintagers never ceased, and the"
2120,II,winepress overflowed without end.
2121,II,
2122,II,"Between the rows of fruit-trees were garden-beds, in which grew all"
2123,II,manner of flowers and useful herbs; and the whole was watered by a
2124,II,"perennial stream, divided into channels which brought the water to"
2125,II,every part of the garden.
2126,II,
2127,II,"Turning with a sigh from that paradise of colour and perfume, Odysseus"
2128,II,"passed on to the house, and stood for a while, scanning that stately"
2129,II,structure. His eyes were almost blinded by the light which flashed
2130,II,"from the outer walls, which were built of solid brass, with a coping"
2131,II,"of blue steel. The doors were of gold, with silver lintel and"
2132,II,"doorposts, and brazen threshold. Then he entered the hall, still"
2133,II,unseen of all eyes; and here new wonders awaited him. Within the
2134,II,"doorway on either side sat dogs wrought in silver and gold, living"
2135,II,"creatures, that know neither age nor death, which Hephæstus, the"
2136,II,"divine artificer, made, in the wisdom of his heart, to guard the house"
2137,II,of the prince Alcinous day and night. At intervals stood figures of
2138,II,"youths fashioned in gold, with torches in their hands, which at"
2139,II,night-time shed a blaze of light throughout the hall. And all round
2140,II,"the walls were set rows of seats, covered with richly woven cloths,"
2141,II,"the work of women's hands. There sat the noble chieftains of Phæacia,"
2142,II,feasting on the bounty of their king.
2143,II,
2144,II,"Far within, visible through a wide-opened door, was seen another"
2145,II,"chamber, where a troop of domestics were busy at their tasks. Some"
2146,II,"were grinding the yellow grain in hand-mills, others were walking to"
2147,II,"and fro at the loom, and others sat plying distaff and spindle,"
2148,II,nodding their heads like poplars waving in the wind. Very choice was
2149,II,"the fabric woven in that chamber, for the women of Phæacia were famed"
2150,II,"beyond all others for their skill in weaving, even as the men"
2151,II,surpassed all the world in seamanship.
2152,II,
2153,II,"Such were the glories of the house of Alcinous, and when Odysseus had"
2154,II,gazed his fill he began to think of the purpose for which he had come.
2155,II,"The feasters were just pouring a libation to Hermes, to be followed by"
2156,II,"a parting cup, before they went home. At that very moment their eyes"
2157,II,"were opened, and they saw Odysseus kneeling at the feet of Arete, and"
2158,II,heard him utter these words:
2159,II,
2160,II,"""Great queen, daughter of a race divine, behold me, a toil-worn"
2161,II,"wanderer, who hath come hither to implore thy grace. Intercede for me,"
2162,II,"I pray thee, with thy husband, that he may send me speedily to my"
2163,II,"native land: and may it be well with thee, and with all this fair"
2164,II,"company, and with the children who come after thee."""
2165,II,
2166,II,Thereupon he sat down by the hearth in the ashes near the fire; and
2167,II,"for awhile not a word was spoken, but all sat gazing at him in wonder."
2168,II,"At last an aged Phæacian broke the silence, and said, looking at"
2169,II,"Alcinous: ""My prince, it becomes thee not to suffer this stranger to"
2170,II,"sit on the ground in the ashes. Behold, we are all waiting for thee to"
2171,II,"speak and declare thy will. Give this poor man thy hand, and set him"
2172,II,"on a seat, that he may know that his prayer is granted. And let them"
2173,II,"give him to eat, and fill a bowl for a libation to Zeus, in whose care"
2174,II,"are all suppliants."""
2175,II,
2176,II,"Alcinous rose in response to the words of the elder, who was famed"
2177,II,"among the Phæacians for his eloquence and wisdom, and taking Odysseus"
2178,II,"by the hand raised him from his abject posture, and seated him by his"
2179,II,"side. Food and drink were placed before him, and while he was eating,"
2180,II,"Alcinous ordered a bowl to be filled for a libation to Zeus, the god"
2181,II,"of hospitality. The wine was served out to the guests, the libations"
2182,II,"were poured, and then Alcinous began to speak again, unfolding his"
2183,II,purpose towards Odysseus.
2184,II,
2185,II,"""Here me, ye princes of Phæacia. Go ye now to your rest, and to-morrow"
2186,II,"we will call an assembly of all the elders, and make a great feast and"
2187,II,"sacrifice, and after that we will take counsel how we may best send"
2188,II,the stranger on his way. Safe and sound we will bring him to his
2189,II,"native land, but after that he must take up his portion, according as"
2190,II,"the Fates have ordained for him, and spun the thread of his life,"
2191,II,"rough or smooth, from the hour when his mother bare him. I speak as"
2192,II,"supposing our guest to be a man; but if he be a god, come down from"
2193,II,"heaven, then I fear that the gods are devising some snare against us."
2194,II,"For never has it been their wont to appear among us in disguise, but"
2195,II,at sacrifice and at feast they freely consort with us in their own
2196,II,"shape, seeing that we are of their own kin."""
2197,II,
2198,II,"""Alcinous,"" answered Odysseus, ""let not this fear trouble thee. I am"
2199,II,"no god, as thou mayest see right well. If ye know any man conspicuous"
2200,II,"for the burden of sorrow which he bears, ye may learn my lot from his."
2201,II,"But none, methinks, can equal the sum of what I have endured by the"
2202,II,"ordinance of heaven. Care sits by my side day and night, but within me"
2203,II,"is a monitor whose voice I must obey, even my hungry belly, that calls"
2204,II,"aloud to be filled, and will not let me alone to chew the cud of"
2205,II,"bitter thought. Shameless he is, and clamorous exceedingly. Therefore"
2206,II,let me sup and question me no further to-night; but rouse thee betimes
2207,II,"to-morrow, and send me with all speed to my native land. Let me once"
2208,II,"see my possessions, and my household, and my stately home, and then I"
2209,II,"will close mine eyes in peace."""
2210,II,
2211,II,A murmur of approval went round the hall as Odysseus ended his speech.
2212,II,"One by one the guests took leave of Alcinous, and he and his hosts sat"
2213,II,"awhile conversing together, while the servants were removing the"
2214,II,"remnants of the feast, and setting the house in order for the night."
2215,II,"Arete was the first to speak, for she recognised the garments which"
2216,II,"Odysseus was wearing as the work of her own hands. ""Friend,"" said she,"
2217,II,"""let me ask thee one question. How camest thou by this raiment? For"
2218,II,surely thou hast not brought it with thee in thy voyage across the
2219,II,"deep. Say who thou art and whence thou comest."""
2220,II,
2221,II,Thus challenged Odysseus told her all the story of his shipwreck on
2222,II,"the island of Calypso, of his long sojourn there, of his voyage on the"
2223,II,"raft, his second shipwreck, and his landing on the coast of Phæacia."
2224,II,"Concluding he touched feelingly on his meeting with Nausicaä, and the"
2225,II,"kindness, courtesy, and modesty of her behaviour. ""Never saw I such"
2226,II,"grace and prudence,"" he added, ""in one so young and so lovely."""
2227,II,
2228,II,"""Yet in this she did not well,"" replied Alcinous, ""that she brought"
2229,II,"thee not straightway to this house, but suffered thee to find thy way"
2230,II,"alone."""
2231,II,
2232,II,"""Nay, blame her not,"" answered Odysseus, ""she bade me come hither with"
2233,II,"herself and the maidens, but I feared to offend thee, and chose to"
2234,II,"come alone."""
2235,II,
2236,II,"""Think not that I am so hasty, or given to causeless anger,"" said"
2237,II,"Alcinous; ""excess in all things is evil.""[1] Then he looked earnestly"
2238,II,"at Odysseus, and continued, after a pause: ""I would to heaven that thy"
2239,II,"thoughts were as mine; then wouldst thou abide for ever in this land,"
2240,II,"and take my daughter to wife, and I would give thee house and lands."
2241,II,But I see that thou art steadfastly purposed to leave us; and none
2242,II,shall detain thee against thy will. To-morrow thou shalt go. I will
2243,II,"appoint a ship and a crew, and they shall bear thee sleeping to thine"
2244,II,"own land, yea though it be more distant than far Euboea, which lies,"
2245,II,"as I am told, in the uttermost parts of the earth. Yet the Phæacians"
2246,II,"went thither in their ships, and returned on the same day. They have"
2247,II,"no equals, as thou shalt soon learn, in seamanship, and no ships in"
2248,II,"all the world are like mine."""
2249,II,
2250,II,"[Footnote 1: _Nothing too much_, the corner-stone of Greek morality.]"
2251,II,
2252,II,"After some further talk they parted for the night, and Odysseus, after"
2253,II,"all his hardships, was right glad to lay him down in the soft bed"
2254,II,prepared for him in the gallery before the house. But before he closed
2255,II,his eyes he muttered a prayer to Zeus that Alcinous might abide by his
2256,II,"promise, and send him safely home."
2257,II,
2258,III,III
2259,III,
2260,III,"Next day was appointed for a great feast in the palace of Alcinous, to"
2261,III,"which all the chief men of Phæacia were invited, and when Odysseus"
2262,III,"returned to the house, after some hours spent in a visit to the town,"
2263,III,hefound the courts and galleries thronged with a great company. The
2264,III,"preparations for the banquet were on a heroic scale: twelve sheep,"
2265,III,"eight fat swine, and two oxen, the choicest of the herd, were"
2266,III,"slaughtered, and a goodly row of casks, filled with the finest"
2267,III,"vintages, gave further token that Alcinous was no niggardly host."
2268,III,
2269,III,"""Come,"" said Alcinous, meeting Odysseus at the gate. ""The guests are"
2270,III,"seated, and all is ready. Trouble not thyself as to the manner of thy"
2271,III,"home-coming; that is cared for already, and the ship lies at her"
2272,III,"moorings. But to-day is a day of good cheer, when thou shalt learn how"
2273,III,"gay and joyous a life the Phæacians live."""
2274,III,
2275,III,"As he spoke, they entered the banquet hall, and Odysseus sat down by"
2276,III,"the side of Alcinous. Rich and dainty was the fare, and many times the"
2277,III,great wine-bowls were filled and emptied; for the Phæacians were a
2278,III,"luxurious race, much given to the pleasures of the table. Among the"
2279,III,"guests Odysseus was especially struck by one venerable figure, who sat"
2280,III,"by himself against a pillar, on which hung a harp within reach of his"
2281,III,"hands. Odysseus noticed that he ate slowly and deliberately, and"
2282,III,"seemed to feel for the cup when he wished to drink, ""It is Demodocus,"
2283,III,"the blind harper,"" whispered Alcinous. ""We shall presently have a"
2284,III,"taste of his quality. He is a rare minstrel."""
2285,III,
2286,III,"Accordingly, when the last course was removed, the harp was placed in"
2287,III,"the singer's hands, and after striking a deep chord he began to sing,"
2288,III,"choosing for his theme a famous tale of Troy, which told how Achilles"
2289,III,"and Odysseus quarrelled at a banquet, and reviled each other with"
2290,III,"bitter words, and how Agamemnon rejoiced in spirit because of the"
2291,III,"strife; for he had heard an oracle from Apollo, foretelling that when"
2292,III,the noblest of the Greeks fell out Troy's end would be near at hand.
2293,III,
2294,III,"Odysseus listened, and a flood of emotion filled his mind, so sad were"
2295,III,"the memories recalled by the minstrel's lay. Of all his gallant peers,"
2296,III,"for ten years his companions in many a joyful feast, and many a high"
2297,III,"adventure, how many were left? And he, among the last of the"
2298,III,"survivors, was now growing old, after twenty years of war and"
2299,III,"wandering, far from his wife and home. He was now, indeed, on the eve"
2300,III,of his return; but at what a price had it been won! And who could tell
2301,III,what heavy trials awaited him when once more he set foot on his native
2302,III,soil? Was it not but too probable that he would find his house made
2303,III,"desolate, Telemachus dead, and Penelope wedded to another?"
2304,III,
2305,III,"Overpowered by these gloomy forebodings, he covered his face, and wept"
2306,III,"aloud. When Demodocus paused in his singing he wiped away his tears,"
2307,III,and poured a drink-offering from his cup; but every time the minstrel
2308,III,"resumed his lay a new fit of weeping succeeded. At last, Alcinous, who"
2309,III,"had hitherto been totally absorbed in that rare minstrelsy, observed"
2310,III,"his guest's emotion, and partly divining the cause came to his relief."
2311,III,"""How say ye, fair sirs?"" he said, rising and addressing the company."
2312,III,"""Shall we go forth for awhile, and show the stranger that we have"
2313,III,"other and manlier pastimes, now that we have eaten and drunken, and"
2314,III,cheered our souls with song? Let him not say of us when he goes home
2315,III,"that we sit all day by the wine-cup, but let him learn that the"
2316,III,"Phæacians surpass all mankind in boxing, and in wrestling, and in"
2317,III,"leaping, and in the speed of their feet."""
2318,III,
2319,III,So saying he rose from his seat and led the way to the place of
2320,III,assembly. Crowds soon flocked to see the friendly trial of strength
2321,III,"and skill. The first event was the foot race, and this was followed by"
2322,III,"matches of wrestling, boxing, leaping, and throwing the weight."
2323,III,"Odysseus stood watching the Phæacians at their sports, and thinking of"
2324,III,the mighty feats which he had witnessed and shared at the funeral
2325,III,"games of Patroclus. Presently he felt a hand on his shoulder, and"
2326,III,"heard himself challenged by a young Phæacian, whose name was Euryalus,"
2327,III,"in these terms: ""Why so gloomy, father? Away with care! All is ready"
2328,III,"for thy departure, and thou shalt soon be home again. But come, give"
2329,III,"us a proof of thy manhood, if thou knowest aught of games of skill."
2330,III,"Thou seemest a stout fellow, and I doubt not that thou wilt acquit"
2331,III,"thee well."""
2332,III,
2333,III,"""Friend,"" answered Odysseus, ""mock me not. Thou seest how broken I am,"
2334,III,and worn by my long battle with the sea; and care sits heavy on my
2335,III,"heart, forbidding me to think of the things which thou namest."""
2336,III,
2337,III,"""Nay,"" said Euryalus, with a scornful laugh, ""I see that I was"
2338,III,"mistaken in thee. Thou art plainly no athlete, but some cunning"
2339,III,"merchant, with thy head full of thy cargo, and fingers only skilled in"
2340,III,"counting thy gains."""
2341,III,
2342,III,"Then Odysseus bent his brows, and answered with a stern look: ""Friend,"
2343,III,thou art over-saucy of thy tongue. But so it ever is; the gods
2344,III,"dispense their gifts with sparing hand, and give not all excellence to"
2345,III,"the same man. One man is mean of aspect, but heaven's grace descends"
2346,III,"upon his lips, so that men look upon him with delight while he"
2347,III,discourses smoothly with a winning modesty. He is the observed of all
2348,III,"observers, and when he walks through the town all eyes follow him as"
2349,III,"if he were a god. Another again is glorious, like a very god, in the"
2350,III,"splendour of his face and form, but no grace attends upon his speech."
2351,III,"Even so thou art conspicuous for thy beauty, as though the hand of a"
2352,III,"god had fashioned thee, but in understanding thou art naught. Thou"
2353,III,hast stung me by thy unseemly words; I am not ignorant of manly
2354,III,"sports, as thou sayest, but I tell thee that I was among the foremost"
2355,III,as long as I trusted in my youth and in the might of my hands. But now
2356,III,"I am sore spent with woe and pain, for many things have I suffered in"
2357,III,"battles by land, and buffeting with the sea. Nevertheless, broken as I"
2358,III,"am, I will give proof of my strength, for thou hast provoked me"
2359,III,"bitterly by thy wanton words."""
2360,III,
2361,III,"Thereupon, without waiting to throw off his cloak, he sprang into the"
2362,III,"arena, and caught up a massy disc of iron, far heavier than those with"
2363,III,"which the Phæacians had been throwing. Poising it lightly, with one"
2364,III,"hand he flung it, as one who flings a ball. The Phæacians sank back in"
2365,III,"dismay as they saw the huge mass flying high over their heads, and"
2366,III,when it fell all rushed to the spot to mark the distance. There it
2367,III,"lay, far beyond the longest cast of the native athletes, and Odysseus"
2368,III,"pointed to it, and said: ""Reach that mark, my young masters, if ye"
2369,III,can! And if any among you have a mind to try a match with me in boxing
2370,III,"or in wrestling, or in the foot race, they shall have their will; only"
2371,III,"with the sons of Alcinous I will not strive, for he is my host, and it"
2372,III,were not fitting or prudent to challenge them. Whatever a man can do
2373,III,"with his hands I can do: I can send an arrow sure and strong, and"
2374,III,"strike down my foe, and herein can no archer surpass me, save one"
2375,III,"only, Philoctetes, who bare the bow of Hercules; and I can fling a"
2376,III,javelin farther than another man can shoot an arrow. Only in speed of
2377,III,foot I fear that some of you may surpass me; for my knees are yet weak
2378,III,"from long fasting and fighting with the waves."""
2379,III,
2380,III,"Not one of the Phæacians took up the challenge, but all sat mute,"
2381,III,"gazing in wonder and awe at this strange man, who had just given such"
2382,III,signal proof of the power of his arm. At last Alcinous answered and
2383,III,"said: ""Stranger, none here can take thy words amiss, for, as thou"
2384,III,"sayest, thou hast been bitterly provoked. But hear me now in turn, and"
2385,III,"push not thy quarrel further, but rest satisfied with the proof of thy"
2386,III,"prowess which thou hast given. I will speak to thee frankly, that thou"
2387,III,mayest know what manner of men the Phæacians are. We are not mighty
2388,III,"men of valour, like thee, yet we too have our own peculiar excellence."
2389,III,"We are good runners, and none can approach us in all that belongs to"
2390,III,"the mariner's art. But at home we live softly, loving the banquet, and"
2391,III,"music and dancing, clean raiment, warm baths, and long repose."" Then"
2392,III,"turning to his attendants he added: ""Go, some of you, and bring hither"
2393,III,"the harper Demodocus, and clear a space for the dancers, that our"
2394,III,"guest may see something of the native sports of Phæacia."""
2395,III,
2396,III,Then those whose business it was chose a fair level space for the
2397,III,"dance, and when Demodocus arrived he took his harp and struck up a"
2398,III,"lively measure. A fair troop of boys stood in a circle around him, and"
2399,III,the dance began. Alcinous had not overrated the skill of his people in
2400,III,"this graceful pastime, and Odysseus was filled with wonder as he"
2401,III,watched the intricate yet ordered movements of the youthful troop.
2402,III,
2403,III,"When the dance was ended, Demodocus sang a soft lay of love, and after"
2404,III,"that the two most skilful dancers, one of whom was Laodamas, a son of"
2405,III,"Alcinous, stood up to dance a reel together. One of them held a"
2406,III,"crimson ball, and, keeping time to the music flung it high into the"
2407,III,"air; while the other leaped high from the ground, and caught the ball"
2408,III,as it fell. Then they flung the ball with lightning rapidity from hand
2409,III,"to hand, so that it seemed a mere streak of crimson shooting backward"
2410,III,"and forward; and all the time the dance went gaily on, while the whole"
2411,III,"company of the Phæacians kept up a merry din, beating time to the"
2412,III,music with their feet.
2413,III,
2414,III,"""Of a truth,"" said Odysseus, addressing Alcinous, ""thou hast not"
2415,III,"boasted for naught; never saw I such dancing in all my long travels."""
2416,III,"A proud man was Alcinous to hear such praise from such a man, and he"
2417,III,"was not slow to testify his gratitude. ""Hear me,"" he said, ""ye princes"
2418,III,of Phæacia! Methinks our guest is a man of exceeding shrewd wit. Let
2419,III,"us bestow on him a parting gift, that he may remember us, and rejoice"
2420,III,in spirit when he thinks of his sojourn in Phæacia. Thirteen there
2421,III,"are, of whom I am one, who sit in high places, and are notable men in"
2422,III,the land; let each of us give him a change of raiment and a talent of
2423,III,"gold. And Euryalus shall crave pardon of him for his ill-chosen words,"
2424,III,"and appease him with a gift."""
2425,III,
2426,III,"The generous proposal was well received, and each of the twelve nobles"
2427,III,sent his body-servant to fetch the gifts. Euryalus also was prompt to
2428,III,make his peace with Odysseus. He presented him with a fine sword of
2429,III,"tempered bronze, with silver hilt, and scabbard of ivory. ""Behold my"
2430,III,"peace-offering,"" he said, ""and take my goodwill with the gift. Forget"
2431,III,"my foolish words, and think of me kindly when thou art safe among"
2432,III,"thine own people."""
2433,III,
2434,III,"Odysseus acknowledged the courtesy of Euryalus in becoming terms, and"
2435,III,"then the whole company rose and went back to the palace of Alcinous,"
2436,III,where they found the gifts for Odysseus all set in order against his
2437,III,"departure. Then Alcinous brought a golden goblet, beautifully"
2438,III,"fashioned, and richly chased, and bade Arete bring a coffer to hold"
2439,III,"the gifts. The coffer was displayed, and was in itself a gift of no"
2440,III,"mean value, being a choice piece of work."
2441,III,
2442,III,"""Now bid thy handmaids prepare a bath for our guest,"" said Alcinous to"
2443,III,"his wife, and ""Receive this as a memorial of me,"" he added, placing"
2444,III,"the goblet in Odysseus' hands, ""that thou mayest remember me all the"
2445,III,"days of thy life, when thou pourest libations to Zeus and the other"
2446,III,"deathless gods."""
2447,III,
2448,III,"Arete gave the order as required, and while the bath was preparing she"
2449,III,arranged all the gifts in the coffer. Then closing the lid she said to
2450,III,"Odysseus: ""Make all fast with thine own hands, that none may meddle"
2451,III,"with thy goods as thou liest asleep on thy passage across the sea."""
2452,III,"Odysseus made fast the cord, securing it with an intricate and cunning"
2453,III,"knot, which he had learnt from the great sorceress Circe; and when he"
2454,III,had finished he was summoned by the eldest of the handmaids to the
2455,III,bath. When he had bathed and put on fresh raiment he came back to the
2456,III,dining-hall; and as he entered he saw Nausicaä leaning against a
2457,III,"pillar. Sweet was the maiden's face, and kind her eyes, as she gazed"
2458,III,with innocent admiration on the stately figure of her father's guest.
2459,III,"""Farewell, my friend,"" said she, ""and when thou arrivest home think"
2460,III,"sometimes of her to whom thou owest thy life."""
2461,III,
2462,III,"""Fair daughter of Alcinous,"" answered Odysseus, ""if that day ever"
2463,III,"comes--if I ever see my home again, by favour of Zeus, the lord of"
2464,III,"Hera--be assured that I shall remember thee in my prayers, as long as"
2465,III,"this life which thou hast given me shall last."" And so he parted from"
2466,III,"the maiden, and she went back to her mother's bower."
2467,III,
2468,III,"Odysseus again received a place of honour by the side of Alcinous, and"
2469,III,a goodly portion of meat was set before him. Looking round the circle
2470,III,"of guests he saw Demodocus, the blind harper, sitting in their midst,"
2471,III,"and wishing to show him honour, he cut off a choice piece from the"
2472,III,"flesh which had been set before him, and bade a servant carry it to"
2473,III,"the bard, and greet him in the giver's name. The servant did as he was"
2474,III,"bidden, and Demodocus received the portion of honour with becoming"
2475,III,gratitude.
2476,III,
2477,III,When the banquet was drawing towards its close Odysseus approached the
2478,III,"minstrel, and after praising his former lay, which told of the"
2479,III,"disastrous homeward voyage of the Greeks, he begged him to sing the"
2480,III,"Lay of the Wooden Horse, the device by which Troy was taken. Demodocus"
2481,III,"complied, and taking his harp began to chant that famous lay, which"
2482,III,"told how the Greeks burnt their tents and sailed away, leaving the"
2483,III,"wooden monster behind them, how the Trojans dragged the horse into the"
2484,III,"city, and how the fatal engine sent forth its burden of armed men in"
2485,III,"the night. The name of Odysseus, the arch-plotter, occurred again and"
2486,III,again as the tale went on; and once more Odysseus was moved to tears
2487,III,by the memories which the words of the bard awakened.
2488,III,
2489,III,"Alcinous observed his emotion, and called to Demodocus to cease his"
2490,III,"song. ""We vex our guest,"" he said, ""for whose sake we are gathered"
2491,III,here. Doubtless the minstrel has touched some hidden spring of sorrow.
2492,III,"But come now,"" he continued, addressing Odysseus, ""we have honoured"
2493,III,"thee exceedingly, and given thee of our best. Wilt thou not repay us"
2494,III,"by telling something of thyself? Let us hear thy name, and say of what"
2495,III,"land and of what city thou art, that our ships may know whither to"
2496,III,steer their course. For know that we mariners of Phæacia need no
2497,III,"pilots nor rudders, but our ships by their own instinct take us to"
2498,III,"whatsoever place we would visit, gliding like phantoms, invisible,"
2499,III,swift as thought. Nor has any vessel from our ports ever suffered
2500,III,shipwreck or harm.
2501,III,
2502,III,"""Thou likewise hast been a great traveller, and seen many lands and"
2503,III,"nations, both such as are wild and fierce and such as are gentle and"
2504,III,"of godly mind. Tell us then the tale of thy wanderings, and say why"
2505,III,"thou weepest ever at the name of Troy."""
2506,III,
2507,III,"All the guests bent forward with eager faces, and strained their ears"
2508,III,to catch Odysseus' answer; for there was something mysterious about
2509,III,"this strange guest, something which marked him as a man of no common"
2510,III,"stamp, and their curiosity, which had hitherto been held in check by"
2511,III,"the laws of courtesy, was now set free from all restraint by the frank"
2512,III,question of Alcinous.
2513,III,
2514,III,"""Illustrious prince,"" answered Odysseus, after a moment's pause,"
2515,III,"""methinks it were best to sit silent and listen to the sweet voice of"
2516,III,the harper; for what better thing has life to offer than a full cup
2517,III,and brave minstrelsy heard at the quiet hour of eventide? But if thou
2518,III,must needs hear a tale of sorrow it is not for me to deny thee. First
2519,III,"of all I will tell thee my name. I am Odysseus, son of Laertes, and my"
2520,III,"name is in all men's mouths because of my deep wit and manifold wiles,"
2521,III,"yea, the renown thereof reaches even unto heaven. My home is the sunny"
2522,III,"isle of Ithaca, last in a line of islands lying in the western sea. It"
2523,III,"is a rugged land, but a nurse of gallant sons; and sweet, ah! very"
2524,III,"sweet, is the name of home. Never hath my heart been turned from that"
2525,III,"dear spot, no, not by all the loveliness of Calypso, nor by all the"
2526,III,"witchery of Circe, but ever I remained faithful to the one lodestar of"
2527,III,"my life."""
2528,III,
2529,III,"Here Odysseus began the wondrous story of his wanderings, which kept"
2530,III,his hearers spellbound until far into the night.

2535,III,The Wanderings of Odysseus
2536,III,
2537,III,
2538,I,I
2539,I,
2540,I,"After leaving Troy, Odysseus first sailed to the coast of Thrace, and"
2541,I,collected a rich booty in a sudden raid on the district. But while his
2542,I,"men lingered to enjoy the first-fruits of their spoil, the wild tribes"
2543,I,"of the neighbourhood rallied their forces, and falling upon the"
2544,I,"invaders, while they were engaged in a drunken revel, drove them with"
2545,I,great slaughter to their ships. No sooner had they put to sea than a
2546,I,"wild tempest came down upon them from the north, and drove them to"
2547,I,"seek shelter again on the mainland, where they lay for two days and"
2548,I,nights in constant dread of another attack from the injured Thracians.
2549,I,"On the third day they set sail again and got as far as Malea, the"
2550,I,southernmost headland of Greece. Here they were again driven from
2551,I,"their course, and after nine days' tossing on the waves they reached"
2552,I,the land of the Lotus-Eaters.
2553,I,
2554,I,"When his men had refreshed themselves, Odysseus sent three of their"
2555,I,number to explore the country and learn the manners of the
2556,I,inhabitants. Presently these three came to the dwellings of the
2557,I,"Lotus-Eaters, who received them kindly and gave them to eat of the"
2558,I,lotus-plant. With the first taste of that magic food the men forgot
2559,I,"the purpose for which they had been sent, forgot their friends and"
2560,I,"their home, and had no desire left in life but to remain there all"
2561,I,their days and feast with the Lotus-Eaters. In this state they were
2562,I,"found by Odysseus, who compelled them by force, though they wept and"
2563,I,"complained bitterly, to return to their ships. There he bound them"
2564,I,"fast under the benches, and bade the rest take to their oars and fly"
2565,I,"from that seductive clime, lest others should fall under the same"
2566,I,fatal spell.
2567,I,
2568,II,II
2569,II,
2570,II,"Thence they came to the land of the Cyclopes, a rude and monstrous"
2571,II,"tribe, but favoured of the immortal gods, by whose bounty they live."
2572,II,"They toil not, neither do they sow, nor till the ground, but the earth"
2573,II,"of herself brings forth for them a bountiful living, wheat and barley,"
2574,II,and huge swelling clusters of the grape. Naught know they of law or
2575,II,"civil life, but each lives in his cave on the wild mountain-side,"
2576,II,"dwelling apart, careless of his neighbours, with his wife and"
2577,II,children.
2578,II,
2579,II,"It was a dark, cloudy night, and a thick mist overspread the sea, when"
2580,II,suddenly Odysseus heard the booming of breakers on a rocky shore.
2581,II,"Before an order could be given, or any measure taken for the safety of"
2582,II,"the ships, the little fleet was caught by a strong landward current,"
2583,II,and whirled pell-mell through a narrow passage between the cliffs into
2584,II,a land-locked harbour. Drawing their breath with relief at their
2585,II,"wonderful escape, they beached their vessels on the level sand and lay"
2586,II,down to wait for the day.
2587,II,
2588,II,In the morning they found that they had been driven to the landward
2589,II,"shore of a long island, which formed a natural breakwater to a"
2590,II,"spacious bay, with a narrow entrance at either end. The island was"
2591,II,"thickly covered with woods, giving shelter to a multitude of wild"
2592,II,"goats, its only inhabitants. For the Cyclopes have no ships, so that"
2593,II,"the goats were left in undisturbed possession, though the place was"
2594,II,"well suited for human habitation, with a deep, rich soil, and"
2595,II,plentiful springs of water.
2596,II,
2597,II,"The first care of Odysseus was to supply the crews of his vessels,"
2598,II,"which were twelve in number, with fresh meat. Armed with bows and"
2599,II,"spears, he and a picked body of men scoured the woods in search of"
2600,II,"game. They soon obtained a plentiful booty, and nine goats were"
2601,II,"assigned to each vessel, with ten for that of Odysseus. So all that"
2602,II,day till the setting of the sun they sat and feasted on fat venison
2603,II,and drank of the wine which they had taken in their raid on the
2604,II,Thracians.
2605,II,
2606,II,"Early next morning Odysseus manned his own galley, and set forth to"
2607,II,"explore the mainland, leaving the rest of the crews to await his"
2608,II,"return on the island. As they drew near the opposite shore of the bay,"
2609,II,the mariners came in view of a gigantic cavern overshadowed by
2610,II,laurel-trees. Round the front of the cavern was a wide court-yard
2611,II,rudely fenced with huge blocks of stone and unhewn trunks of trees.
2612,II,
2613,II,"Having moored his vessel in a sheltered place, Odysseus chose twelve"
2614,II,"of his men to accompany him on his perilous adventure, and charging"
2615,II,"the others to keep close, and not stir from the ship, he prepared for"
2616,II,"his visit to the Cyclops, who dwelt apart from his brethren in the"
2617,II,cavern. Amongst the spoils obtained in Thrace was a small store of
2618,II,"peculiarly rich and generous wine, which had been given him by a"
2619,II,"priest of Apollo whom he had protected, with his wife and child, while"
2620,II,his men were pillaging the town. Twelve jars of this precious vintage
2621,II,"the priest brought forth from a secret hiding-place, known only to"
2622,II,himself and his wife and one trusty servant. So potent was the wine
2623,II,that it needed but one measure of it to twenty of water to make a
2624,II,"fragrant and comfortable drink, from which few could refrain. Odysseus"
2625,II,"now filled a great goatskin bottle with this wine, and carried it with"
2626,II,him. And well it was for him that he did so.
2627,II,
2628,II,"During the day the Cyclops was abroad, watching his flocks as they"
2629,II,grazed on the mountain pastures; so that when Odysseus and his men
2630,II,"came to the cavern, they had ample time to look about them. The"
2631,II,"courtyard was fenced off into pens, well stocked with ewes and"
2632,II,"she-goats, with their young--huge beasts, rivalling in stature their"
2633,II,"gigantic shepherd. Within the cavern was a sort of dairy, with great"
2634,II,"piles of cheeses, and vessels brimming with whey."
2635,II,
2636,II,"""Quick now,"" whispered one of the men to Odysseus. ""Let us take of the"
2637,II,"cheeses, and drive off the best of the lambs and kids to the ship"
2638,II,before the Cyclops returns; for methinks he will give us but sorry
2639,II,"welcome if he finds us here."" ""Nay,"" answered Odysseus, ""I will wait"
2640,II,"for the master, that I may see him face to face. It may be that he"
2641,II,"will bestow on me some gift, such as strangers receive from their"
2642,II,"hosts."" So they remained, and having kindled a fire they prepared"
2643,II,"savoury meat, and ate of the cheeses which they found in the cave."
2644,II,"Then they waited, until the lengthening shadows showed that evening"
2645,II,was drawing near.
2646,II,
2647,II,"While they sat thus, conversing in low tones, and casting fearful"
2648,II,"glances towards the cavern's mouth, all at once they heard a sound"
2649,II,"like the trampling of many feet, accompanied by loud bleatings, which"
2650,II,were answered by the ewes and she-goats in the courtyard. Then a vast
2651,II,"shadow darkened the cavern's entrance, and in came Polyphemus, driving"
2652,II,"his flock before him. At the sight of that fearful monster, huge as a"
2653,II,"mountain, with one vast red eye glaring in the middle of his forehead,"
2654,II,Odysseus and his comrades fled in terror to the darkest corner of the
2655,II,cave. The Cyclops bore in one hand a mighty log for his evening fire.
2656,II,Flinging it down with a crash that awakened all the echoes of the
2657,II,"cavern, he closed the entrance with an immense mass of stone, which"
2658,II,served as a door. Then he sat down and began to milk the ewes and
2659,II,"she-goats. Half of the milk he curdled for cheese, and half he kept"
2660,II,"for drinking. So when he had strained off the whey, and pressed the"
2661,II,"curds into wicker-baskets, he kindled a fire, and as the flame blazed"
2662,II,"up, illumining every corner of the cavern, he caught sight of the"
2663,II,"intruders, and with a voice which sounded like the roaring of a"
2664,II,"torrent cried out: ""Who are ye that have come to the cave of"
2665,II,"Polyphemus, and what would ye have of him?"""
2666,II,
2667,II,"When he heard that appalling voice, and looked at that horrible face,"
2668,II,"fitfully lighted up by the blaze of the fire, Odysseus felt his heart"
2669,II,"stand still with terror. Nevertheless he manned himself to answer, and"
2670,II,"spake boldly thus: ""We are Greeks, driven from our course in our"
2671,II,"voyage from Troy, and brought by the winds and waves to these shores."
2672,II,"And we are they who have served Agamemnon, son of Atreus, whose fame"
2673,II,"now fills the whole earth; so mighty was the city which he overthrew,"
2674,II,with all the host within her. And now we have come to kneel at thy
2675,II,feet and beseech thee of thy favour to bestow on us some gift such as
2676,II,"strangers receive. Have pity on us, great and mighty as thou art, and"
2677,II,forget not that Zeus hath the stranger and the suppliant in his
2678,II,"keeping."""
2679,II,
2680,II,But there was no sign of pity or mercy in the Cyclops' face as he made
2681,II,"answer: ""Thou art full simple, my friend, or unversed in the ways of"
2682,II,"this land, if thou thinkest that I and my brethren care aught for Zeus"
2683,II,"or any other god. Nay, we are mightier far than they, and if thou"
2684,II,"seekest aught of me thou must seek it of my favour, and not of my"
2685,II,"fears. But tell me truly, where didst thou moor thy vessel on thy"
2686,II,"landing? Lies she near at hand, or on a distant part of the coast?"""
2687,II,
2688,II,Odysseus easily divined the purpose of Polyphemus in putting this
2689,II,"question, and answered accordingly: ""My ship was wrecked on a distant"
2690,II,"part of your coast, dashed all to pieces against the rocks; and I and"
2691,II,"these twelve escaped by swimming."""
2692,II,
2693,II,"Polyphemus made no reply, but sprang up and seized two of the men,"
2694,II,"grasping them easily together in one hand, and dashed their brains out"
2695,II,against the rocky ground. Then he cut them in pieces and made his
2696,II,"supper on them. Fearful it was to see him as he ate, crunching up"
2697,II,"flesh and bones and marrow all together, like a ravening lion. When he"
2698,II,"had devoured the last morsel he took a deep draught of milk, and lay"
2699,II,down on the cavern floor among his flocks to sleep.
2700,II,
2701,II,As soon as the heavy breathing of Polyphemus showed that he was fast
2702,II,"asleep, Odysseus crept from his corner, resolved to slay the cannibal"
2703,II,"giant on the spot. He had already drawn his sword, when a sudden"
2704,II,"thought made him pause. If he killed Polyphemus, how was he to escape"
2705,II,"from the cavern? The entrance was blocked by that ponderous stone,"
2706,II,which a hundred men could not have moved; and he and his men must in
2707,II,that case perish miserably of hunger and thirst. Restrained by this
2708,II,"reflection, he put up his sword, and went back to his companions to"
2709,II,wait for day.
2710,II,
2711,II,"Polyphemus rose early, and after milking his flocks he laid hold of"
2712,II,"two more of the miserable captives, butchered them in the same manner,"
2713,II,"and made his breakfast on their warm, quivering bodies. Then he drove"
2714,II,"forth his sheep and goats, pushing aside the door of rock, and set it"
2715,II,"back in its place, as a man sets the lid on a quiver. They heard his"
2716,II,"wild cries, as he called to his flocks, and their loud bleatings as he"
2717,II,"drove them out to pasture; then the sounds grew fainter and fainter,"
2718,II,"and silence settled on the vast, shadowy cave."
2719,II,
2720,II,Forthwith Odysseus began to devise means to escape from that murderous
2721,II,"den, and avenge the slaughter of his friends. As he peered about in"
2722,II,"the twilight, he caught sight of a mighty stake of green olive-wood,"
2723,II,"tall and stout as the mast of a twenty-oared galley,[1] which had been"
2724,II,"cut by the Cyclops for a staff, and laid aside to season. Odysseus cut"
2725,II,"off about a fathom's length, and with the help of his comrades made it"
2726,II,"round and smooth, and tapered it off at one end to a point. Then he"
2727,II,"hardened the sharp end in the fire, and when it was ready he hid the"
2728,II,rude weapon away under a pile of refuse. Of the twelve who had
2729,II,"followed him from the ship, there only remained eight; four of these"
2730,II,were chosen by lot to aid him in his plan of vengeance; and Odysseus
2731,II,noted with satisfaction that they were the stoutest and bravest of the
2732,II,"company. All being now ready, they sat down to wait for the return of"
2733,II,Polyphemus.
2734,II,
2735,II,"[Footnote 1: Imitated, with characteristic amplification, by Milton,"
2736,II,"""Paradise Lost,"" i. 292 (Satan's spear).]"
2737,II,
2738,II,The setting sun was pouring his level rays through the chinks of the
2739,II,doorway when they heard the ponderous tread of the Cyclops
2740,II,"approaching. This time he drove the whole of his flocks into the cave,"
2741,II,"leaving the courtyard empty. Having milked the herd, he laid hands on"
2742,II,"two of Odysseus' comrades, and slaughtered and devoured them as"
2743,II,before. The moment had now come for Odysseus to carry out his design.
2744,II,"So he filled a wooden bowl with unmixed wine, and drawing near to"
2745,II,Polyphemus addressed him thus:
2746,II,
2747,II,"""Take, Polyphemus, and drink of this wine, now that thou hast eaten of"
2748,II,human flesh. I warrant that thou hast never tasted such a choice
2749,II,"vintage as this, and I brought it as a gift to thy divinity, that thou"
2750,II,"mightest have pity, and let me go in peace. Little did I dream to find"
2751,II,thee so cruel and so wild. Who in all the world will ever draw near to
2752,II,"thee again, after the hideous deeds which thou hast wrought?"""
2753,II,
2754,II,Polyphemus took the cup and drained it to the bottom. Then he rolled
2755,II,"his great eye with ecstasy, as the last drop trickled down his"
2756,II,"monstrous gullet, and holding out the cup said with a sort of growling"
2757,II,"good humour: ""Give me to drink again, and make haste and tell me thy"
2758,II,"name, that I may bestow on thee a gift of hospitality to gladden thy"
2759,II,"heart. I and my brethren have wine in plenty, for the earth gives us"
2760,II,"of her abundance, and the soft rain of heaven swells the grape to"
2761,II,"ripeness; but this is a drink divine, fit for the banquets of"
2762,II,"Olympus."""
2763,II,
2764,II,"Again the cup was filled, and yet a third time; and Polyphemus drank"
2765,II,"out every drop. Before long his great head began to droop, and his eye"
2766,II,"blinked mistily, like the red sun looming through a fog. Seeing that"
2767,II,"the good wine was doing its work, Odysseus lost no time in telling his"
2768,II,"name. ""Thou askest how I am called,"" he said in cozening tones, ""and"
2769,II,"thou shalt hear, that I may receive the gift which thou hast promised"
2770,II,"me. My name is Noman; so call me my father and my mother, and all my"
2771,II,"friends."" When he heard that, Polyphemus ""grinned horribly a ghastly"
2772,II,"smile,"" and answered: ""This shall be thy gift: I will eat thee last of"
2773,II,"all, for the sake of thy good wine."""
2774,II,
2775,II,"With that he sank down backward on the floor, and lay like a"
2776,II,"leviathan, with his head lolling sideways, and his mouth gaping,"
2777,II,buried in drunken sleep.
2778,II,
2779,II,"""Now is our time!"" whispered Odysseus, and taking the sharpened stake"
2780,II,from its hiding place he thrust the point into the glowing embers of
2781,II,the fire. As soon as he saw that the weapon was red hot and about to
2782,II,"burst into flame, he took it up, and gave it to his men. Then,"
2783,II,"breathing a prayer to Heaven for strength and courage, they stole"
2784,II,softly to the place where the Cyclops lay. Odysseus clambered up to
2785,II,"the forehead of the Cyclops, holding on by his hair, and while the"
2786,II,others pressed the glowing point of the ponderous stake into the
2787,II,"monster's eye he whirled it round by means of a thong, as men turn an"
2788,II,auger to bore a ship's timber. The point hissed and sputtered as it
2789,II,"sank deep into the pulpy substance of the eye, and there was an acrid"
2790,II,"smell of burning flesh, while the great shaggy eyebrow took fire, and"
2791,II,"cracked like a burning bush. ""It is a fine tempering bath for this"
2792,II,"good spear of ours,"" muttered Odysseus, as he worked away at the"
2793,II,"strap. ""Temper it well--Polyphemus shall have it as a parting gift"""
2794,II,
2795,II,At first the Cyclops writhed and groaned in his sleep; then with a
2796,II,"roar as of a hundred lions he awoke, and started up to a sitting"
2797,II,"posture, scattering his puny tormentors, who fled in wild haste, and"
2798,II,hid themselves in the angle of a projecting rock. Polyphemus rose
2799,II,"slowly to his feet, tore the stake from the empty eye-socket, and"
2800,II,"flung it from him, still uttering his fearful cries. His brethren"
2801,II,"heard him, and quitting their caverns, came flocking round his gate,"
2802,II,"to see what had befallen. ""What ails thee, Polyphemus,"" they asked,"
2803,II,"""that thou makest this dreadful din, murdering our sleep? Is anyone"
2804,II,stealing thy sheep or thy goats? Or seeks anyone to slay thee by force
2805,II,"or by guile?"""
2806,II,
2807,II,"""Friends,"" answered the afflicted giant, ""Noman is slaying me by"
2808,II,"guile, neither by force."""
2809,II,
2810,II,"""Go to,"" replied his brethren, ""if no man is using thee despitefully,"
2811,II,"why callest thou to us? Thou art stricken, it seems, with some sore"
2812,II,"disease: pray, then, to thy father Poseidon, and cumber us no more."""
2813,II,"So away they went, growling at their broken sleep, and left their"
2814,II,blinded brother to roar alone.
2815,II,
2816,II,"Meanwhile Odysseus had been hard at work, taking measures to escape"
2817,II,with his comrades from the cave. Among the flocks of Polyphemus were
2818,II,"several big rams, with fleeces of remarkable thickness and beauty. Of"
2819,II,"these he took three at a time, and lashed them together, side by side,"
2820,II,"with osiers, which served Polyphemus for a bed. Each middle ram bore"
2821,II,one of the men firmly bound with osiers under his belly; while the two
2822,II,outside rams served to conceal that living burden. Last of all
2823,II,"Odysseus provided for his own safety. There was one monster ram, the"
2824,II,"leader of the flock, with a grand fleece which trailed on the ground,"
2825,II,"like the leaves of the weeping ash. Him Odysseus reserved for himself,"
2826,II,and creeping under his belly hauled himself up until he was entirely
2827,II,"hidden by the drooping fleece, and so hung on steadfastly, waiting for"
2828,II,the day.
2829,II,
2830,II,"At last the weary vigil was over, the huge stone portal was rolled"
2831,II,"aside, and the male sheep and goats went forth to pasture, while the"
2832,II,"females remained in their pens, bleating and in pain, for they were"
2833,II,"swollen with milk, and there was none to relieve them. As the rams"
2834,II,"went past Polyphemus felt their backs, to see if the men were there;"
2835,II,but the simple monster never thought of feeling under their bellies.
2836,II,"Last in the train came the big ram, with Odysseus clinging underneath."
2837,II,"Then said Polyphemus, as his great hands passed over his back: ""Dear"
2838,II,"ram, why art thou the last to leave the cave? Thou wast never wont to"
2839,II,"be a sluggard, but ever thou tookest the lead, walking with long"
2840,II,"strides, whether thou wast cropping the tender, flowering grass, or"
2841,II,"going down to the waterside, or returning at even to the fold. Surely"
2842,II,"thou art heavy with sorrow for thy master's eye, which the villain"
2843,II,Noman and his pitiful mates have blinded. Would that thou hadst a
2844,II,"voice, to tell me where he is skulking from my fury! Then would I pour"
2845,II,"forth his brains like water on the ground, and lighten my heart of the"
2846,II,woe which hath been brought upon me by the hands of this nithering[1]
2847,II,"Noman."""
2848,II,
2849,II,"[Footnote 1: See Scott, ""Ivanhoe.""]"
2850,II,
2851,II,"So saying he let the ram go, and as soon as he was clear of the"
2852,II,"courtyard Odysseus dropped to the ground, and ran to loose his"
2853,II,"comrades. With all speed they made their way down to the ship, driving"
2854,II,"the rams before them, with many a fearful backward glance. Right glad"
2855,II,"were their friends to see them again, though their faces fell when"
2856,II,they saw their numbers reduced by half. But there was no time for
2857,II,"regrets, for Polyphemus was already close upon them, groping his way"
2858,II,"painfully from rock to rock. So they flung the sheep on board, shoved"
2859,II,"off the vessel, and took to their oars. While they were still within"
2860,II,"earshot Odysseus bade his men cease rowing, and standing up in the"
2861,II,"stern called aloud to the Cyclops in mocking tones: ""How likest thou"
2862,II,"my gift for thy hospitality, my gentle host? Methinks thou art paid in"
2863,II,"full, and canst not complain that I have not given thee good measure."""
2864,II,
2865,II,"When he heard that, Polyphemus bellowed with rage, and tearing up a"
2866,II,great boulder from the side of the cliff he flung it with mighty force
2867,II,in the direction of the voice. It fell into the sea right in front of
2868,II,"the ship, and raised a billow which washed her back to the shore."
2869,II,"Odysseus pushed her off with a long pole, and signalled to his men to"
2870,II,"give way. They rowed for dear life, and had attained twice the former"
2871,II,"distance from the shore when Odysseus stopped them again, though they"
2872,II,"besought him earnestly to forego his rash purpose, and to refrain from"
2873,II,"provoking Polyphemus more. But he, being exceeding wroth for the"
2874,II,"murder of his men, would not be persuaded; and lifting up his voice he"
2875,II,"spake again: ""Cyclops, if anyone ask thee to whom thou owest the loss"
2876,II,"of thine eye, say that it was Odysseus, the son of Laertes, who reft"
2877,II,"thee of sight, and his home is in rocky Ithaca."""
2878,II,
2879,II,[Illustration: Odysseus and Polyphemus]
2880,II,
2881,II,"Now it happened that many a year back Polyphemus had heard a prophecy,"
2882,II,foretelling that he should one day be blinded by a certain Odysseus.
2883,II,"So when he heard that name he was stricken to the very heart, and"
2884,II,"cried aloud: ""This, then, is the fulfilment of the oracle! Verily I"
2885,II,"thought that some tall and proper man would come hither to assail me,"
2886,II,"but now I have been outwitted, made drunk, and blinded, by this"
2887,II,"little, paltry wretch."" After a pause he spoke again, thinking to"
2888,II,"fight that man of many wiles with his own weapons. ""Come hither,"
2889,II,"Odysseus,"" he said, softening his big voice as well as he could, ""that"
2890,II,I may entertain thee with loving-kindness; and afterwards I will pray
2891,II,"to Poseidon, whose son I am, to send a fair breeze for thy homeward"
2892,II,"voyage. And he also shall heal my hurt, and give me back my sight."""
2893,II,
2894,II,"Odysseus laughed aloud at the poor monster's simplicity, whereupon"
2895,II,"Polyphemus lifted up his hands to heaven, and prayed to his sire, the"
2896,II,"lord Poseidon: ""Hear me, thou who holdest the earth in thine arms, if"
2897,II,"I am indeed thy son. Grant me that Odysseus may never reach his home,"
2898,II,"or if that is fixed beyond repeal, let him come home in evil plight,"
2899,II,"with the loss of all his men, on a strange ship, to a house of"
2900,II,"woe.""[1]"
2901,II,
2902,II,"[Footnote 1: Compare Dido's curse (""Stories from the Æneid,"" p. 84).]"
2903,II,
2904,II,"Such was the curse of Polyphemus, to be fulfilled, as we shall see, to"
2905,II,"the letter. And having uttered it he flung another rock, which fell"
2906,II,"just short of the vessel's stern, and raised a wave which washed her"
2907,II,towards the island. Soon they reached the harbour where the rest of
2908,II,"the fleet lay moored. Joyful were the greetings of their comrades, who"
2909,II,had given them up for lost; and a merry feast they made on the flesh
2910,II,"of the fat sheep, though their mirth was checkered by sadness when"
2911,II,they thought of the brave six who had come to so horrible an end in
2912,II,the Cyclops' cave.
2913,II,
2914,II,After leaving the land of the Cyclopes they came next to the Æolian
2915,II,"island, where dwelt Æolus with his wife and twelve sons and daughters."
2916,II,"The island floated on the sea, and all around it tall cliffs ran sheer"
2917,II,"down to the water, crowned on their summit by a wall of brass. Here"
2918,II,"they remained a whole month, and were hospitably entertained by Æolus,"
2919,II,"revelling in the abundance of his wealthy house, and whiling away the"
2920,II,"time with music, and dance, and song, and brave stories of the Trojan"
2921,II,"war. And when they departed he gave Odysseus a leathern bag, tied with"
2922,II,"a silver cord, in which were confined all the winds that blow, except"
2923,II,"only the good west wind, which he left free to blow behind them and"
2924,II,speed them on their way.
2925,II,
2926,II,"So for nine days and nights they sailed without let or hindrance, and"
2927,II,"on the tenth they came in sight of Ithaca, which they approached so"
2928,II,near that they saw the smoke and flame of the beacon-fires along the
2929,II,"coast. Odysseus was worn out with watching, for during all the voyage"
2930,II,"he had not closed his eyes, but had sat the whole time with his hand"
2931,II,"on the sheet, and suffered no one to relieve him. But now within sight"
2932,II,"of his native land he sank down in utter weariness, and fell into a"
2933,II,deep sleep.
2934,II,
2935,II,That fatal moment of weakness led to a long train of disasters. His
2936,II,men had long gazed with curious and jealous eyes at the mysterious
2937,II,"wallet, which they supposed to be full of gold and silver. As long as"
2938,II,Odysseus was on his guard they durst not give utterance to their
2939,II,thoughts; but when they saw him overtaken by slumber they began to
2940,II,"murmur among themselves. And thus they spake one to another: ""Behold"
2941,II,how this man is honoured and beloved whithersoever he goes! He left
2942,II,"Troy-land laden with booty, and thereto hath Æolus added this rich"
2943,II,"treasure, while we must come home with empty hands. Go to, let us have"
2944,II,"sight of all this gold and silver."""
2945,II,
2946,II,So waking folly prevailed over slumbering prudence. In a moment the
2947,II,"silver cord was loosened, and all the boisterous winds rushed forth"
2948,II,and bore them weeping and wailing far from their native land. Roused
2949,II,"by the tumult of the tempest, and the despairing cries of his men,"
2950,II,"Odysseus sprang up, just in time to see the last glimpse of the hills"
2951,II,of Ithaca as they melted in the distance. His first impulse was to
2952,II,fling himself into the sea and perish; but mastering his frenzy he
2953,II,"covered his face, and sat down in speechless misery, while the winds"
2954,II,bore them swiftly back to the isle of Æolus.
2955,II,
2956,II,With a heavy heart Odysseus went up to the house where he had been
2957,II,"received so kindly, and told his sorrowful tale. ""Pity my weakness,"""
2958,II,"he pleaded, ""and let me not suffer for the sins of my men."" But Æolus"
2959,II,"was not to be moved. ""Begone,"" he said sternly, ""quit this island at"
2960,II,"once, thou caitiff! Heaven hath set the seal of its hatred upon thee,"
2961,II,"and I may not give countenance to such as thou. Out of my sight!"" he"
2962,II,"thundered, and Odysseus crept sadly back to his ship."
2963,II,
2964,II,"Then for six days they voyaged on, toiling continually at the oar, for"
2965,II,now there was no favourable wind to waft them on. They were almost
2966,II,"dead with fatigue when they sighted land on the seventh day, and came"
2967,II,"to anchor in a sheltered bay, surrounded on all sides by towering"
2968,II,"cliffs, with a narrow entrance, guarded by a tall spire of rock on"
2969,II,"either side The place was called Læstrygonia, and the nights in that"
2970,II,country are so short that the shepherd as he drives home his flocks at
2971,II,sundown meets his fellow-toiler on his way to the pasture.
2972,II,
2973,II,The cautious Odysseus moored his ship close to the entrance of the
2974,II,"harbour, while all the others came to anchor at the head of the bay"
2975,II,"under the shadow of the cliffs; for there was not a wave, not a"
2976,II,"ripple, in that sheltered spot, but the water slumbered, as in a"
2977,II,"mountain tarn. Having secured his vessel, by making fast her cable to"
2978,II,"the rocks, he scaled the cliff with a few of his men, and seeing smoke"
2979,II,"rising in the distance he sent three scouts to explore the country,"
2980,II,meantime going back to his ship to await their return.
2981,II,
2982,II,Sooner than he expected he saw two of the men descending the cliff in
2983,II,"headlong haste, and as they drew near he could read on their white,"
2984,II,terror-stricken faces what sort of news they had to bring. Their
2985,II,report was as dismal as their looks. When they left the coast they
2986,II,"struck into a level road cut through the forest, and presently came to"
2987,II,"a spring on the outskirts of a town. Here they met a maiden, drawing"
2988,II,"water at the well, who told them that she was the daughter of"
2989,II,"Antiphates, king of that country, and offered to conduct them to her"
2990,II,"father's house. They went with her, and when she had brought them home"
2991,II,she left them to summon her father.
2992,II,
2993,II,"""As soon as we caught sight of him,"" continued he who was telling the"
2994,II,"story, ""we were stricken with terror, for he was of monstrous stature"
2995,II,"and hideous to behold. One of us he seized, and rent him in pieces on"
2996,II,the spot; but we two fled for our lives. There is no time to lose. The
2997,II,"town is in uproar, and before long the whole cannibal tribe will be"
2998,II,"upon us."""
2999,II,
3000,II,Hardly had he finished when a multitude of these huge savages was seen
3001,II,rushing along the edge of the cliffs which overlooked the harbour.
3002,II,"Arming themselves with great rocks, they began to bombard the ships"
3003,II,which had taken the inside station; and a dreadful din arose of
3004,II,"shattered timbers, mingled with the cries of dying men. Not one ship"
3005,II,"escaped destruction, and when that part of their work was ended the"
3006,II,"barbarians swarmed down the cliffs, speared the floating corpses, and"
3007,II,dragged them to land for a cannibal feast.
3008,II,
3009,II,All this time Odysseus and his crew had been helpless spectators of
3010,II,this scene of massacre. But when they saw that all was over they cut
3011,II,"their cable, and taking to their oars rowed with might and main until"
3012,II,"a wide space of open water divided them from that ill-fated shore,"
3013,II,where all their friends had found a grave.
3014,II,
3015,IV,IV
3016,IV,
3017,IV,Of the thirteen vessels with which Odysseus sailed from Troy only one
3018,IV,was now left. Weary and broken in spirit they voyaged on over the
3019,IV,"waste of waters; and when, after two or three days' sail, they landed"
3020,IV,"on a low-lying coast, they lay down for two days and two nights, like"
3021,IV,men whose last hope in life was gone. On the third morning Odysseus
3022,IV,"roused himself, and ascending a rising ground saw to his dismay that"
3023,IV,they had landed on a small island. On all sides stretched the
3024,IV,"boundless sea, without a trace of land on the whole horizon."
3025,IV,
3026,IV,As he was descending the hill he heard a rustling in a neighbouring
3027,IV,"thicket, and a tall stag with branching antlers stepped forth, and"
3028,IV,began to make his way down to a little stream which skirted the foot
3029,IV,of the hill. From the high ground on which he stood Odysseus had a
3030,IV,"full view of the beast's broad back, and taking steady aim he flung"
3031,IV,his spear and pierced him through the spine. Odysseus' eyes glistened
3032,IV,"when he saw the splendid quarry at his feet, for never had he seen so"
3033,IV,"fine a buck. Not without effort he took the carcass on his back, and"
3034,IV,"bore it down to his ship, where he found his men still lying"
3035,IV,"listlessly where he had left them. ""Courage, comrades,"" he cried, as"
3036,IV,"he flung his heavy burden on the sand. ""We shall not die before our"
3037,IV,"day, and while we have life we must eat and drink. Better a full"
3038,IV,"sorrow than a fasting.""[1] So they ate and drank, and made good cheer."
3039,IV,
3040,IV,"[Footnote 1: See the whole incident imitated in Virgil (""Stories from"
3041,IV,"the Æneid,"" p. 49).]"
3042,IV,
3043,IV,"Next day Odysseus divided his whole crew into two companies, two and"
3044,IV,"twenty each, with himself as captain of one division, and Eurylochus,"
3045,IV,"his faithful squire, in command of the other. Then he drew lots with"
3046,IV,Eurylochus to determine which of the two should undertake the perilous
3047,IV,"duty of exploring the island. The lot fell upon Eurylochus, and he at"
3048,IV,"once set forth with his party, pursued by the prayers and tears of"
3049,IV,those who remained behind.
3050,IV,
3051,IV,"Passing the low hills which skirted the coast, they struck into a"
3052,IV,"forest path, and presently came to an open glade, in the midst of"
3053,IV,which stood a fair stone dwelling. And as they came and drew nigh unto
3054,IV,the house they saw a strange sight: before the doors stalked and
3055,IV,"glared a multitude of wolves and lions, and other beasts of prey, and"
3056,IV,"when they saw the men these fearful creatures came fawning round them,"
3057,IV,"like hounds welcoming their master, and did them no harm."
3058,IV,
3059,IV,"Quaking with wonder and fear, they came and stood on the threshold,"
3060,IV,"through which they caught sight of a young and lovely dame, pacing to"
3061,IV,"and fro about her loom, and weaving a wondrous web, fair and large,"
3062,IV,such as the daughters of the gods are wont to weave. And as she plied
3063,IV,"her task, she sang to herself in a low and thrilling voice, sad and"
3064,IV,sweet as the notes of the Æolian harp. Presently she turned her face
3065,IV,"to the doorway, and saw the men standing without. With a bright smile"
3066,IV,"she came forward, and bade them enter; and they all went in, save only"
3067,IV,"Eurylochus, who was older than the rest, and liked not the look in"
3068,IV,that fair lady's eyes.
3069,IV,
3070,IV,"""Welcome, fair youths,"" she said, ""to the halls of Circe, daughter of"
3071,IV,"the sun. Sit ye down, while I prepare you a posset to slake your"
3072,IV,"thirst on this hot day."" So they sat down, and Circe took wine, and"
3073,IV,"grated cheese, and honey, and barley-meal, and mixed them in a bowl,"
3074,IV,"muttering strange words, and adding a single drop from a little phial"
3075,IV,"which she took from a secret cupboard. Then she gave them to drink,"
3076,IV,"touching them, as she did so, with a wand; and no sooner had they"
3077,IV,tasted than their form and countenance was changed into the likeness
3078,IV,"of swine, though they kept the mind and feelings of men. Circe now"
3079,IV,"drove them all together into a stye, and flung down beechmast, and"
3080,IV,"acorns, and cornel berries, for them to eat."
3081,IV,
3082,IV,It was drawing towards noon when Odysseus saw a solitary figure
3083,IV,"descending the slope which led down to the beach. ""Eurylochus!"" he"
3084,IV,"cried, recognising the familiar features of his squire. ""Why comest"
3085,IV,"thou alone?"" For some time Eurylochus was unable to utter a word; at"
3086,IV,"last he spoke, in a broken and altered voice, while his face was"
3087,IV,"blanched with deadly terror. ""They are gone,"" he faltered--""spirited"
3088,IV,"away--vanished without a sign. The place is haunted: let us away!"""
3089,IV,
3090,IV,"Without a word, Odysseus caught up his sword and bow, and ordered"
3091,IV,Eurylochus to show him the way to the place where he had lost his men.
3092,IV,"But Eurylochus clung to his knees, and besought him to remain, and"
3093,IV,"prepare for instant flight. Seeing him to be unnerved by terror,"
3094,IV,"Odysseus bade him stay by the ship, and he himself set out alone to"
3095,IV,learn the secrets of this mysterious island.
3096,IV,
3097,IV,"Just before coming within sight of Circe's palace, he saw, standing in"
3098,IV,"his path, a fair and comely youth, who greeted him kindly, and took"
3099,IV,him by the hand. There was something more than human beauty in the
3100,IV,"face of this stranger, and his words showed more than human knowledge"
3101,IV,"of Odysseus and his affairs; for indeed he was no other than Hermes,"
3102,IV,"the messenger of the gods, sent down from heaven to aid Odysseus in"
3103,IV,"this strait. ""Son of Laertes,"" he said, ""why goest thou thus unwarily,"
3104,IV,"even as a silly bird into the net of the fowler? Pause awhile, or,"
3105,IV,"instead of setting free thy men, thou wilt become even as they are."""
3106,IV,"So saying he stooped down, and with careful hands tore up a little"
3107,IV,plant which was growing at their feet; the flower of it was white as
3108,IV,"milk, and the root was black. ""Take this plant,"" he said, giving it to"
3109,IV,"Odysseus. ""It is the magic herb, Moly, and no human hand may pluck it;"
3110,IV,"having this, thou mayest defy all the spells of Circe. And when thou"
3111,IV,"comest to the house of that fair witch, she will offer thee a potion,"
3112,IV,"mixed with baneful drugs: drink thou thereof, for it shall do thee no"
3113,IV,harm. But when she smites thee with her wand draw thou thy sword and
3114,IV,make as though thou wouldst slay her; and she will be filled with
3115,IV,"fear, for none ever resisted her power before. Then do thou compel her"
3116,IV,to swear a great oath that she will devise no further ill against
3117,IV,"thee."" As the last words were uttered Hermes vanished, leaving"
3118,IV,Odysseus standing with the plant in his hand.
3119,IV,
3120,IV,[Illustration: Circe]
3121,IV,
3122,IV,"And as the god had spoken, even so it came to pass. Circe welcomed"
3123,IV,"Odysseus with the same treacherous smile, gave him to drink of the"
3124,IV,"same cup, and struck him with her wand in the same manner; but when"
3125,IV,"she saw him standing, unchanged and unmoved, threatening her with"
3126,IV,"drawn sword, she feared exceedingly, and falling at his feet spake"
3127,IV,"thus in pitiful tones: ""Who art thou, that thou yieldest not to the"
3128,IV,"power of my drugs, which never mortal resisted before? Art thou that"
3129,IV,"Odysseus of whom Hermes spake, telling me that he should come hither"
3130,IV,"on his voyage from Troy? Put up thy sword, and thou shalt be my guest"
3131,IV,"to-night, and for many days to come."""
3132,IV,
3133,IV,"""No guest will I be of thine,"" answered Odysseus sternly, ""unless thou"
3134,IV,wilt swear a great oath to do me no hurt. Before that I will not trust
3135,IV,"thee, or receive aught at thy hands. Hast thou not turned my men into"
3136,IV,"swine, and didst thou not seek even now to put thy wicked spells upon"
3137,IV,"me?"""
3138,IV,
3139,IV,"Then Circe took the oath that was required of her, and thus secured"
3140,IV,Odysseus consented to remain. Forthwith his beautiful hostess summoned
3141,IV,"her handmaids, sweet nymphs of rivers, and woods, and springs, and"
3142,IV,bade them make all things ready to entertain the wanderer. With white
3143,IV,"feet tripping nimbly, and many a curious glance at the majestic"
3144,IV,"stranger, the maidens hastened to obey her command. And soon the"
3145,IV,"tables, which were all of silver, were set forth with golden vessels,"
3146,IV,"the chairs spread with purple tapestries, and the rich red wine"
3147,IV,"mingled in a silver bowl. Others prepared a bath for Odysseus, and"
3148,IV,"when he had bathed, more than mortal health and vigour seemed to enter"
3149,IV,"his limbs, such virtue had Circe shed into the water."
3150,IV,
3151,IV,"After that they sat down to meat; but Odysseus, whose mind was full of"
3152,IV,"his comrades, left every dish untasted, and sat without uttering a"
3153,IV,"word. When she observed it, Circe rallied him for his sullenness: ""Art"
3154,IV,"thou afraid to eat?"" she said, smiling: ""have I not sworn to do thee"
3155,IV,"no harm? Ah! thou art thinking of thy friends. Come, then, and I will"
3156,IV,"restore them to thee."" So she brought him to the stye where they were"
3157,IV,"confined together, and opening the gate drove them all forth, a herd"
3158,IV,of bristly swine. Then she anointed them one by one with another drug;
3159,IV,"and instantly the bristles fell away from them, and they became men"
3160,IV,"again, only younger and fairer to behold than they were before. With"
3161,IV,"tears of joy they embraced Odysseus, and the whole place rang with"
3162,IV,"their happy greetings, so that even Circe was moved by the tender"
3163,IV,scene.
3164,IV,
3165,IV,"When they had grown calmer she bade Odysseus go down to the sea, and"
3166,IV,bring back all the rest of his company to take up their abode in her
3167,IV,"house. Being now quite reassured as to her purpose, he hesitated not"
3168,IV,"to obey, and went down alone to carry the message from Circe. Arrived"
3169,IV,at the ship he was hailed by his comrades as one returned from the
3170,IV,dead; but putting aside their eager questions he told them to beach
3171,IV,"the vessel, stow away all her tackle, and follow him to the house of"
3172,IV,"Circe, where they would find all their fellows feasting and making"
3173,IV,merry.
3174,IV,
3175,IV,"Much cheered by his words the men set to work with willing hands, and"
3176,IV,before an hour had passed the whole company was reunited under Circe's
3177,IV,"hospitable roof. The dreaded witch had laid aside all her terrors, and"
3178,IV,"now appeared only in the character of a kind and generous hostess,"
3179,IV,whose sole care was for the comfort and welfare of her guests. Days
3180,IV,"lengthened into weeks, and weeks into months, and still they lingered"
3181,IV,"on in that luxurious clime, as if there were no such place as Ithaca,"
3182,IV,and no wide waste of sea to be crossed.
3183,IV,
3184,IV,"At last, when they had lived a whole year on the island, Odysseus' men"
3185,IV,"began to grow weary of their long inaction, and begged their leader to"
3186,IV,"obtain Circe's permission to depart. Not without some misgivings,"
3187,IV,"Odysseus preferred his request. ""Deem me not ungrateful,"" he said, ""if"
3188,IV,"my heart turns ever to my wife and home. I am but a mortal man, with"
3189,IV,"human needs and frailties, and no fit mate for a goddess like thee."
3190,IV,"And my men weary me with their importunity, when thou art not near."""
3191,IV,
3192,IV,"Circe heard him graciously, knowing well that they must part. ""I will"
3193,IV,"not keep thee,"" she said, ""against thy will. But a long journey lies"
3194,IV,"before thee, even to the very ends of the earth, and not until that is"
3195,IV,past canst thou set thy sail for home. To the halls of Hades thou must
3196,IV,"go, and consult the spirit of Theban Teiresias, who alone among all"
3197,IV,"the dead hath an understanding heart, while the rest are but flitting"
3198,IV,"shadows. Now hearken, and I will tell thee all that thou must do. When"
3199,IV,"thou leavest these shores thou shalt sail ever southward, until thou"
3200,IV,"hast reached the farther side of the River Oceanus, and come to the"
3201,IV,shadowy grove which stands at the confines of the realm of Persephone.
3202,IV,"There thou shalt land with thy company, and dig a trench a cubit in"
3203,IV,"length and breadth, and pour about it a libation of mead and water and"
3204,IV,"wine; and after that thou shalt offer a sacrifice of black sheep, in"
3205,IV,such wise that the blood thereof shall flow into the trench and fill
3206,IV,"it. Thither will flock the whole multitude of departed spirits, to"
3207,IV,"drink of the blood; but do thou draw thy sword, and hold it over the"
3208,IV,"trench, nor suffer any of the other spirits to draw near until thou"
3209,IV,"hast seen Teiresias and hearkened to his lore."""
3210,IV,
3211,IV,"All that night Odysseus remained in deep conference with Circe, and as"
3212,IV,soon as day dawned he went to rouse his men who were sleeping in the
3213,IV,"outer chamber. ""Up, comrades!"" he cried, ""all is prepared, and we must"
3214,IV,"embark without delay."" His loud summons proved fatal to one of the"
3215,IV,"company, a certain Elpenor, the youngest of them all, who, the night"
3216,IV,"before, had lain down to sleep on the housetop, for the sake of the"
3217,IV,"coolness, being heated with wine. Roused suddenly by the voice of"
3218,IV,"Odysseus, he staggered to his feet, and, still half asleep, stumbled"
3219,IV,"over the parapet in his haste, and fell headlong from the roof."
3220,IV,
3221,IV,"In the hurry of their departure the body was left where it lay, and"
3222,IV,"Odysseus, when they reached the ship, did not notice his absence. They"
3223,IV,"found that Circe had been there before them, and left the victims for"
3224,IV,sacrifice bound to the vessel's side. She herself was nowhere to be
3225,IV,"seen, and so without another word of farewell they launched their"
3226,IV,galley and put out into the deep.

3236,I,"A clear, strong wind came down from the north, sent by the favour of"
3237,I,"the mighty enchantress Circe, and over the trackless sea they sped,"
3238,I,where never furrow of mortal ship was seen before. After a long day's
3239,I,"sail they came to the farther shore of the ocean stream, which"
3240,I,surrounds the earth as with a girdle. There is the abode of the people
3241,I,"called the Cimmerians, wrapped in shadow and mist; for never doth the"
3242,I,"sun look down upon them with his rays, neither when he climbs the"
3243,I,"starry sky, nor yet when he goeth down unto the place of his rest. And"
3244,I,thus they dwell miserably under the curse of perpetual night.
3245,I,
3246,I,As they peered through the gloom they saw what seemed a grove of dusky
3247,I,"trees, in shape like the poplar and willow, fringing the shore. ""It is"
3248,I,"the sign which Circe gave me,"" whispered Odysseus to his awestruck"
3249,I,"comrades; ""we are at the very gates of Hades."" Landing in silence,"
3250,I,"they carried the victims for sacrifice to the verge of the grove, and"
3251,I,"Odysseus with his sword dug a trench, a cubit in length and breadth,"
3252,I,and poured about it a libation of mead and water and wine. Then the
3253,I,"sheep were slaughtered, and the trench was filled to the brim with"
3254,I,"their blood. When the solemn rite was ended, Odysseus called in a loud"
3255,I,"voice to the spirits of the dead, and waited in breathless expectation"
3256,I,with his men.
3257,I,
3258,I,"Presently a rustling sound was heard, like the sound of the autumn"
3259,I,"wind in the dry leaves of the forest; it grew louder and louder, and"
3260,I,"out of the gloom the ghosts came flocking, youths and maidens cut off"
3261,I,"in their bloom, old men with all their burden of sorrow, and warriors"
3262,I,"slain in battle, still wearing the bloodstained armour.[1] With a wild"
3263,I,"unearthly cry they came crowding to the trench, eager to drink of the"
3264,I,"blood. But Odysseus, though quaking with fear, stood his ground"
3265,I,"firmly, and held his drawn sword over the trench to keep off the"
3266,I,"multitude, until he had seen and spoken with Teiresias."
3267,I,
3268,I,"[Footnote 1: Compare ""Stories from the Æneid,"" p. 119.]"
3269,I,
3270,I,"Among the hosts of spirits there was one who lingered near the trench,"
3271,I,and seemed by his beseeching gestures and earnest looks to desire
3272,I,speech with Odysseus. When his first fears were over Odysseus
3273,I,"recognised the features of Elpenor, who had come to an untimely end on"
3274,I,"the morning of their journey, and whose body still lay unburied in the"
3275,I,house of Circe. Registering a mental vow to perform all due rites to
3276,I,"that poor spirit on his homeward voyage, Odysseus warned him back, and"
3277,I,stood waiting for the coming of the seer.
3278,I,
3279,I,"At last came one with tottering footsteps, leaning on a golden"
3280,I,"sceptre, and halted on the farther edge of the trench. It seemed a"
3281,I,"very aged man, with flowing white beard, and sightless eyes; and"
3282,I,"Odysseus knew by these signs that he was in the presence of Teiresias,"
3283,I,"the famous prophet of Thebes, who alone among departed spirits"
3284,I,"preserves his understanding, while the rest are flitting phantoms,"
3285,I,"with no sense at all. ""What wouldst thou of me, Odysseus, son of"
3286,I,"Laertes,"" said the spectre in faltering tones, ""and wherefore hast"
3287,I,thou left the glad light of day to visit this drear and joyless realm
3288,I,"of the dead? Draw back from the trench, and put up thy sword in its"
3289,I,"sheath, that I may drink of the blood and tell thee all that thou"
3290,I,"wouldst know."""
3291,I,
3292,I,"Thereupon Odysseus fell back, and sheathed his sword; and Teiresias,"
3293,I,"when he had drunk of the blood, spoke again in firmer and clearer"
3294,I,"tones: ""Thou art fain to hear of thy home-coming, illustrious hero;"
3295,I,"but thy path to Ithaca shall be beset with sorrows, because of the"
3296,I,"wrath of Poseidon, whose son, Polyphemus, thou hast blinded."
3297,I,"Nevertheless thou and all thy company shall return safe to Ithaca, if"
3298,I,"only ye leave untouched the sacred flocks and herds of Helios,[1] when"
3299,I,ye come to the island of Thrinacia. But if harm befall them at your
3300,I,"hands, from that hour thy ship and all her crew are doomed and forfeit"
3301,I,"to destruction: and though thou thyself escape, yet thou shalt return"
3302,I,"after many days, in evil plight, to a house of woe.[2] And now learn"
3303,I,how thou mayest at last appease the anger of the god who pursues thee
3304,I,with his vengeance. When thou art once more master in thine own house
3305,I,"thou shalt go on a far journey, carrying with thee an oar of thy"
3306,I,"vessel, until thou comest to a people that dwell far from the sea, and"
3307,I,know naught of ships or the mariner's art. And there shalt meet thee
3308,I,by the way a man who shall say that thou bearest a winnowing shovel[3]
3309,I,"on thy shoulder; and this shall be a sign unto thee, whereby thou"
3310,I,shalt know that thou hast reached the end of thy journey. Then plant
3311,I,"thy oar in the ground, and offer sacrifice to Poseidon. This shall be"
3312,I,"the end of thy toils, and death shall come softly upon thee where thou"
3313,I,"dwellest in a green old age among thy happy people."""

3320,I,
3321,I,When he had thus spoken Teiresias vanished into the darkness; and one
3322,I,"by one the spirits came up to the trench, as Odysseus suffered them,"
3323,I,and having drunk of the blood obtained strength to speak and answer
3324,I,"his questions. First among them was the spirit of his mother,"
3325,I,"Anticleia, daughter of Autolycus, who had been hovering near during"
3326,I,"his conference with Teiresias. When she had drunk she said: ""Whence"
3327,I,"comest thou, my son? Art thou still wandering on thy long voyage from"
3328,I,"Troy, or hast thou been in Ithaca, and seen thy wife?"""
3329,I,
3330,I,"""Nay, mother,"" answered Odysseus, ""I am wandering still, still"
3331,I,"treading the path of woe, since the day when I followed Agamemnon to"
3332,I,"Troy. But tell me now, and answer me truly, what was the manner of thy"
3333,I,"death? Came it slowly, by long disease, or did Artemis lay thee low in"
3334,I,a moment with a painless arrow from her bow?[1] And tell me of my
3335,I,father and my son whom I left in Ithaca; do they still hold my
3336,I,"possessions, or hath some other thrust them with violence from my"
3337,I,"seat? Tell me also of Penelope, my wedded wife, whether she abides"
3338,I,"steadfast and guards my goods, or whether she is gone to cheer some"
3339,I,"other man's heart."""
3340,I,
3341,I,[Footnote 1: Sudden death was ascribed to Artemis or Apollo.]
3342,I,
3343,I,"""Steadfast indeed she is,"" replied Anticleia, ""and wondrous patient of"
3344,I,heart; all her thoughts are ever of thee. No one has yet usurped thy
3345,I,"place in Ithaca, but Telemachus still reaps thy fields and sits down"
3346,I,"to meat with the noblest in the land. As to thy father, he comes no"
3347,I,"more to the town, but dwells continually on his farm. He lives not"
3348,I,"delicately, as princes use, but is clad in sorry raiment, and sleeps"
3349,I,"in the winter among the ashes of the hearth with his thralls, and in"
3350,I,"summer on a bed of dry leaves in his vineyard. There he lies forsaken,"
3351,I,"heavy with years and sorrows, mourning for thee. And in such wise also"
3352,I,"death came upon me, neither by wasting sickness nor by the gentle"
3353,I,"shafts of Artemis, but my sore longing for thee, Odysseus, and for thy"
3354,I,"sweet counsels, at last broke my heart."""
3355,I,
3356,I,"A flood of tenderness overpowered Odysseus at these sad words, and he"
3357,I,sprang forward with arms outstretched to clasp his mother to his
3358,I,"breast. Thrice he essayed to embrace her, and thrice his arms closed"
3359,I,"on emptiness,[1] while that ghostly presence still flitted before him"
3360,I,"like a shadow or a dream. ""O my mother,"" cried Odysseus in deep"
3361,I,"distress, ""why dost thou mock me thus? Come to my heart, dear mother;"
3362,I,"let me hold thee in mine arms once more, and mingle my tears with"
3363,I,"thine. Or art thou but the shadow of a shade, a phantom sent by"

3369,I,fashion of mortals when they die. Flesh and bone and sinew are
3370,I,"consumed by the might of fire, but the spirit takes flight and hovers"
3371,I,ever like a winged dream. But make haste and get thee back to the
3372,I,"daylight, and keep all that thou hast seen in memory that thou mayest"
3373,I,"tell it to thy wife."""
3374,I,
3375,I,"When the spirit of Anticleia was gone, a shadowy throng pressed"
3376,I,"forward to the trench, all the ghosts of noble dames, wives and"
3377,I,"daughters of princes. And Odysseus kept his place, sword in hand,"
3378,I,"suffering them only to drink one by one, that he might question them"
3379,I,"and learn their story. There he saw Alcmene, the mother of Hercules,"
3380,I,"and Leda, to whose twin sons, Castor and Pollux, a strange destiny was"
3381,I,allotted; for after their death they rose to life again on alternate
3382,I,"days, one lying in the tomb, while the other walked the earth as a"
3383,I,"living man. There too was Iphimedeia, mother of the giants Otus and"
3384,I,"Ephialtes, who at nine years of age were nine fathoms in height and"
3385,I,"nine cubits in breadth. Haughty were they, and presumptuous in their"
3386,I,"youth; for they made war on the gods, and piled Ossa on Olympus, and"
3387,I,"Pelion on Ossa, that they might scale the sky. But they perished in"
3388,I,"their impiety, shot down by the bolts of Apollo's golden bow. Last"
3389,I,"came Eriphyle, the false wife, who sold her husband's life for a"
3390,I,glittering bribe.
3391,I,
3392,I,That dream of fair women melted away and another ghostly band
3393,I,"succeeded, the souls of great captains and mighty men of war. Foremost"
3394,I,"among these was seen one of regal port, around whom was gathered a"
3395,I,"choice company of veteran warriors, all gored and gashed with recent"
3396,I,wounds. He who seemed their leader stretched out his hands towards
3397,I,"Odysseus with a piteous gesture, and tears such as spirits weep[1]"
3398,I,gushed from his eyes. Instantly Odysseus recognised in that stricken
3399,I,"spirit his great commander Agamemnon, once the proud captain of a"
3400,I,"thousand ships, now wandering, forlorn and feeble, with all his glory"
3401,I,faded.

3407,I,"here that I find thee, great chieftain of the embattled Greeks? Say,"
3408,I,"how comest thou hither, and what arm aimed the stroke which laid thee"
3409,I,"low?"" ""Not in honour's field did I fall,"" answered Agamemnon, ""nor yet"
3410,I,"amid the waves. It was a traitor's hand that cut me off, the hand of"
3411,I,"Ægisthus, and the guile of my accursed wife. He feasted me at his"
3412,I,"board, and slaughtered me as one slaughters a stalled ox; and all my"
3413,I,company fell with me in that den of butchery. It was pitiful to see
3414,I,all that brave band of veterans writhing in their death agony among
3415,I,"the tables loaded with good cheer, and goblets brimming with wine. But"
3416,I,"that which gave me my sorest pang was the dying shriek of Cassandra,"
3417,I,"daughter of Priam, who was struck down at my side by the dagger of"
3418,I,Clytæmnestra. Then the murderess turned away and left me with staring
3419,I,"eyes and mouth gaping in death. For naught is so vile, naught so"
3420,I,"cruel, as a woman who hath hardened her heart to tread the path of"
3421,I,"crime. Even so did she break her marriage vows, and afterwards slew"
3422,I,the husband of her youth. I thought to have found far other welcome
3423,I,when I passed under the shadow of mine own roof-tree. But this
3424,I,"demon-wife imagined evil against me, and brought infamy on the very"
3425,I,"name of woman."""
3426,I,
3427,I,"""Strange ordinance of Zeus!"" said Odysseus musingly, ""which hath"
3428,I,"turned the choicest blessing of man's life, the love of woman, into"
3429,I,"the bitterest of curses for thee and for thy house. Yea, and upon all"

3432,I,
3433,I,"""Ay, trust them not,"" replied Agamemnon bitterly, ""Never give thy"

3435,I,and then laugh thee to scorn. But why do I speak thus to thee? Thou
3436,I,"hast indeed a treasure in thy wife; no wiser head, no truer heart,"
3437,I,"than hers. Happy art thou, and sweet the refuge which is prepared for"
3438,I,"thee after all thy toils, Well I remember the day when we set sail"
3439,I,"from Greece, and how fondly thou spakest of her, thy young bride, with"
3440,I,"her babe at her breast. Now he will be a tall youth, and with what joy"

3442,I,"to know!"""
3443,I,
3444,I,"After that Odysseus was silent, his mind full of sweet and anxious"

3447,I,"dwelt on earth: Achilles, Patroclus, and Antilochus, and farther off,"
3448,I,"looming dimly in the darkness, the gigantic shade of Ajax. Achilles"
3449,I,"was the first to speak. ""Son of Laertes,"" he said, ""thou man of"

3451,I,yet further? Are there no perils left for thee in the land of the

3454,I,
3455,I,"""I came to inquire of Teiresias,"" answered Odysseus, ""concerning my"

3457,I,"thou, Achilles, wast happy in thy life, honoured as a god by all the"
3458,I,"sons of Hellas; and now thou art happy, even in death, for honour"
3459,I,"waits on thy footsteps still."""
3460,I,
3461,I,"""Tell me not of comfort in death,"" replied Achilles. ""Rather would I"
3462,I,"breathe the air of heaven, yea, though I were thrall to a man of"
3463,I,"little substance, than reign as king over all the shades of the dead."
3464,I,"But give me some news of my son, Neoptolemus. Came he to fight with"
3465,I,"the Trojans after I was gone, and did he acquit him well? And knowest"
3466,I,"thou aught of my father, Peleus? Lives he still in honour and comfort"
3467,I,"among my people, or has he been driven into beggary by violent men,"
3468,I,"now that he is old and I am not near to aid him? Oh, for an hour of"
3469,I,"life, with such might as was mine when I fought in the van for Greece?"
3470,I,"Then should they pay a bitter reckoning, whosoever they be that wrong"
3471,I,"him and keep him from his own."""
3472,I,
3473,I,"""Of Peleus,"" answered Odysseus, ""I have heard nothing, but of thy son,"
3474,I,"Neoptolemus, I can tell thee much, for I myself brought him from"
3475,I,"Scyros to fight in Helen's cause, and thereafter my eye was ever upon"
3476,I,"him, to mark how he bore himself. In council none could vie with him,"
3477,I,save only Nestor and myself; ne'er saw I so rare a wit in so young a
3478,I,head. And when the Greeks were arrayed in battle against the Trojans
3479,I,"he was never seen to hang back, but fought ever in the van among the"
3480,I,"foremost champions, like a mighty man of war. Nor was it only in the"
3481,I,clamour and heat of war that he proved his mettle; for in that
3482,I,"perilous hour when we lay ambushed in the wooden horse, when the"
3483,I,"stoutest hearts among us quailed, he never changed colour, but sat"
3484,I,"fingering his spear and sword, waiting for the signal to go forth to"
3485,I,the assault. And after we had sacked the lofty towers of Troy he
3486,I,"received a goodly portion of the spoil, and a special prize of honour,"
3487,I,"and so departed, untouched by point or blade, to his father's house."""
3488,I,
3489,I,"When he heard these brave tidings of his son, Achilles rejoiced in"
3490,I,"spirit, and strode with lofty gait along the plain of asphodel."
3491,I,
3492,I,"So one by one the spirits came up, and inquired of Odysseus of their"
3493,I,"dear ones at home. Only the soul of Ajax, son of Telamon, stood"
3494,I,sullenly aloof; for between him and Odysseus there was an old quarrel.
3495,I,After the death of Achilles a dispute arose among the surviving
3496,I,chieftains for the possession of his armour. It was decided to refer
3497,I,"the matter to the Trojan captives in the camp, and they were asked who"
3498,I,of all the Greeks had done them most harm. They answered in favour of
3499,I,"Odysseus, who accordingly received the armour. Thereupon Ajax fell"
3500,I,"into a frenzy of rage, and slew himself. When Odysseus saw him, and"
3501,I,"marked his unforgiving mood, he was filled with remorse and pity, and"
3502,I,"strove to soften his resentment with gentle words. ""Ah! son of"
3503,I,"Telamon,"" he said, ""canst thou not forgive me, even here? Sorely the"
3504,I,"Argives mourned thee, and heavy was the loss brought on them by thy"
3505,I,"rash act. Thou wast a very tower of strength to the host, and we wept"
3506,I,"for thee as for a second Achilles. Draw near, great prince, subdue thy"

3521,II,vision. Suddenly the pall of darkness which shrouded the secrets of
3522,II,"the nether abyss was lifted, and the whole realm of Hades was exposed"
3523,II,"to view. There he saw the place of torment, where great malefactors"

3530,II,"the neck in a cool stream; the water lapped against his chin, but he"
3531,II,"had not power to drink it, though he was tormented with a burning"
3532,II,"thirst. As often as he stooped to drink, the water was swallowed up,"
3533,II,and the earth lay dry as the desert sand at his feet. And nodding
3534,II,"boughs of trees drooped, heavy with delicious fruit, over his head;"
3535,II,"but when he put forth his hand to pluck the fruit, a furious gust of"
3536,II,wind swept it away far beyond his reach. And yet another famous
3537,II,"criminal he saw, Sisyphus, the most cunning and most covetous of the"
3538,II,"sons of men. He was toiling painfully up a steep mountain's side,"
3539,II,"heaving a weighty stone before him, and straining with hands and feet"
3540,II,"to push it to the summit. But every time he approached the top, the"
3541,II,"stone slipped through his hands, and thundered and smoked down the"
3542,II,mountain's side till it reached the plain.
3543,II,
3544,II,"Other wonders and terrors might still have been revealed, but as that"
3545,II,hardy watcher stood at his post a great tumult and commotion arose in
3546,II,"that populous city of the dead, and the whole multitude of its ghostly"
3547,II,"denizens came rushing towards the trench, as if resolved to expel the"
3548,II,daring intruder. Odysseus' heart failed him when he saw the air thick
3549,II,"with hovering spectres, who glared with dreadful eyes, and filled the"
3550,II,air with the sound of their unearthly voices. Turning his back on that
3551,II,"place of horror he made his way slowly towards the shore, where he"
3552,II,found his men anxiously awaiting him.

3560,I,I
3561,I,
3562,I,"Following the same course as on his outward voyage, Odysseus put in"
3563,I,"again at the island of Circe, where his first duty was to bury the"
3564,I,"body of the young Elpenor, whose ghost he had seen in an attitude of"
3565,I,mute reproach at the threshold of Hades. They were again received with
3566,I,all hospitality by Circe.
3567,I,
3568,I,"After the evening meal Circe drew Odysseus apart, and questioned him"
3569,I,"on all that he had seen and heard on that strange journey, from which"
3570,I,"he had returned, as she said, like one ransomed from death. And when"
3571,I,he had told his story she instructed him as to the course which he had
3572,I,"to steer on leaving the island, and warned him against the manifold"
3573,I,perils of the voyage.
3574,I,
3575,I,"""First,"" said she, ""thou wilt come to the rocks of the Sirens, maidens"
3576,I,"of no mortal race, who beguile the ears of all that hear them. Woe to"
3577,I,him who draws near to listen to their song! He shall never see the
3578,I,"faces of his wife and children again, or feel their arms about his"
3579,I,"neck, but there he shall perish, and there his bones shall rot."
3580,I,"Therefore take heed, and when thou drawest near the place stop the"
3581,I,"ears of thy men with wax, and bid them bind thee fast with cords, that"
3582,I,thou mayest hear the song of the Sirens. And when that seducing melody
3583,I,"fills thine ears, thou wilt beg and implore thy comrades to set thee"
3584,I,"free, that thou mayest draw near and have speech of the Sirens. Then"
3585,I,"let them bind thee more firmly to the mast, and take to their oars,"
3586,I,and fly the enchanted rocks.
3587,I,
3588,I,"""This peril past, thou hast the choice of two different routes. One of"
3589,I,"these will bring thee to the Wandering Isles, which stand, front to"
3590,I,"front, with steep slippery sides of rock, running sheer down to the"
3591,I,"sea. Between them lies a narrow way, which is the very gate of death."
3592,I,"For if aught living attempts to pass between, those rocky jaws close"
3593,I,upon it and grind it to powder. Only the doves which bear ambrosia to
3594,I,"Father Zeus can pass that awful strait, and one of these pays toll"
3595,I,"with her life as she passes, but Zeus sends another to fill her place."
3596,I,"And one ship sailed safely through, even the famous _Argo_ when she"
3597,I,bore Jason and his crew on their voyage from the land of Æetes. All
3598,I,"others when they essayed the task perished, and were brought to naught"
3599,I,in a whirlwind of foam and fire.
3600,I,
3601,I,"""But if thou takest the other way thou wilt come to another strait,"
3602,I,"guarded day and night by two sleepless sentinels, Scylla and"
3603,I,"Charybdis. On one side thereof towers a lofty peak, shrouded, even in"
3604,I,"the noon of summer, in clouds and thick darkness. No mortal man could"
3605,I,"climb that steep and slippery rock, not though he had twenty hands and"
3606,I,"twenty feet; for the side is smooth as polished marble, and in the"
3607,I,midst of the cliff is a shadowy cave overlooking the track by which
3608,I,"thou must guide thy ship, Odysseus. Deep down it goes into the heart"
3609,I,"of the mountain, so that a man in his lusty prime could not shoot an"
3610,I,arrow from his ship to the bottom of that yawning pit In the cave
3611,I,"dwells Scylla, and yelps without ceasing. Her voice is thin and"
3612,I,"shrill, like the cry of a hound newly littered, but she herself is a"
3613,I,"monster horrible to behold, so that neither man nor god could face her"
3614,I,"without affright. Twelve feet hath she, and six necks of prodigious"
3615,I,"length, and on each neck a fearful head, whose ravening jaws are armed"
3616,I,with triple rows of teeth. As far as her waist she is hidden in the
3617,I,"hollow cave, but she thrusts out her serpent necks from the abyss, and"
3618,I,fishes in the waters for dolphins and sea-dogs and other creatures
3619,I,whose pasture is the sea. On every ship that passes her den she levies
3620,I,a tribute of six of her crew.
3621,I,
3622,I,"""On the other side of the strait thou wilt see a second rock, lying"
3623,I,"flat and low, about a bowshot from the first. There stands a great"
3624,I,"fig-tree, thick with leaves, and under it sits Charybdis, sucking down"
3625,I,"the water, and belching it up again three times a day. Beware that"
3626,I,"thou approach not when she sucks down the water, for then none could"
3627,I,"save thee from destruction, no, not Poseidon himself. Rather steer thy"
3628,I,"galley past Scylla's cave, for it is better to lose six of thy men"
3629,I,than to lose them all.
3630,I,
3631,I,"""Next thou shalt come to the island of Thrinacia, where graze the oxen"
3632,I,"of Helios and his goodly sheep--seven herds of oxen, and as many fair"
3633,I,"flocks of sheep, and fifty in each flock and herd. They are not born,"
3634,I,"neither do they die, and two goddesses have charge of them,"
3635,I,"fair-haired nymphs, the daughters of Helios. Take heed that thou harm"
3636,I,"not the sacred beasts, that it may be well with thee, and that thou"
3637,I,"and thy company may come safely home."""
3638,I,
3639,II,II
3640,II,
3641,II,"Once more they were afloat, and the brave little vessel bounded gaily"
3642,II,"over the waves, her canvas bellying in the wind. For some hours they"
3643,II,"sailed on thus, and Odysseus recited to his men all that he had heard"
3644,II,"from Circe. Then suddenly the wind dropped, and the sail hung idly to"
3645,II,"the mast. Having furled and stowed the sail, they took to their oars,"
3646,II,"while the sea went down, and at last sunk to a level calm. In the"
3647,II,"distance a low-lying coast appeared, which Odysseus knew to be the"
3648,II,"island of the Sirens, Forthwith he began to make his preparations to"
3649,II,meet the danger which lay before them. Taking a ball of wax he cut it
3650,II,"into small pieces, and having worked each piece in his hand until it"
3651,II,was soft and plastic he carefully stopped the ears of all his men with
3652,II,"the wax. Then two of the crew, to whom he had already given his"
3653,II,"orders, bound him hand and foot to the mast of the vessel. All being"
3654,II,"ready, they rowed forward until they came within full view of the"
3655,II,"island. And there, in a low-lying meadow hard by the sea, sat the"
3656,II,"Sirens; lovely they were of aspect, and gracious of mien; but all"
3657,II,around them were piled the bones of men who had fallen victims to
3658,II,"their wicked wit,[1] fleshless ribs, from which the skin still hung in"
3659,II,"yellow shreds, and grinning skulls, gazing with eyeless sockets at the"
3660,II,sea.
3661,II,
3662,II,"[Footnote 1: Shakespeare, ""Hamlet.""]"
3663,II,
3664,II,"As the ship drew near, the whole choir lifted up their voices and"
3665,II,"began to sing a sweet and piercing strain, which thrilled the very"
3666,II,marrow of Odysseus as he listened. The winds hovered near on flagging
3667,II,"wing, the sea lay locked in deep repose, and all nature paused with"
3668,II,"attentive ear, to catch the SONG OF THE SIRENS."
3669,II,
3670,II,"""Mighty warrior, sage renowned,"
3671,II,"Turn, O turn thy bark this way!"
3672,II,"Rest upon this holy ground,"
3673,II,Listen to the Sirens' lay.
3674,II,Never yet was seaman found
3675,II,"Passing our enchanted bay,"
3676,II,"But he paused, and left our bound"
3677,II,Filled with wisdom from his stay.
3678,II,"All we know, whatever befell"
3679,II,"On the tented fields of Troy,"
3680,II,"All the lore that Time can tell,"
3681,II,"All the mystic fount of joy."""
3682,II,
3683,II,"It was a strain cunningly calculated to flatter a deep, subtle spirit"
3684,II,"like that of Odysseus. To know all! to read all secrets, and unravel"
3685,II,the tangled skein of human destiny! What a bribe was this to this
3686,II,restless and eager mind! Then the voices of the witch-women were so
3687,II,"liquid, and the music so lovely, that they took the very air with"
3688,II,"ravishment, and melted the hearer's soul within him. Odysseus"
3689,II,"struggled to break his bonds, and nodded to his men to come and loose"
3690,II,"him. But they, who had been warned of this very thing, rose up and"
3691,II,"bound him with fresh cords. Then they grasped their oars again, the"
3692,II,"water roared under their sturdy strokes, and soon they were out of"
3693,II,hearing of that seductive melody.
3694,II,
3695,II,They had not long lost sight of the Sirens' Rocks when they heard the
3696,II,"booming of breakers, which warned them that the fearful strait between"
3697,II,Scylla and Charybdis was close at hand. A strong current caught the
3698,II,galley and whirled her with appalling swiftness towards the point of
3699,II,"danger. The water boiled and eddied around them, and the blinding"
3700,II,spray was dashed into their faces. Then a sudden panic came upon the
3701,II,"crew, so that they dropped their oars, and sat helpless and unnerved,"
3702,II,"expecting instant death. In this emergency, Odysseus summoned up all"
3703,II,"his courage, and strode up and down between the benches, exhorting,"
3704,II,"entreating, and calling each man by name. ""Why sit ye thus,"" he cried,"
3705,II,"""huddled together like sheep? Row, men, row for your lives! And thou,"
3706,II,"helmsman, steer straight for the passage, lest we fall into a direr"
3707,II,"strait, and be crushed between the Wandering Rocks. We have faced a"
3708,II,"worse peril than this, when we were penned together in the Cyclops'"
3709,II,"cave; and we shall escape this time also, if only ye will keep a stout"
3710,II,"heart."""
3711,II,
3712,II,Circe had cautioned Odysseus on no account to attempt resistance when
3713,II,"he approached the cave of Scylla; nevertheless, he put on his armour,"
3714,II,"and took his stand on the prow of the vessel, holding in each hand a"
3715,II,lance.
3716,II,
3717,II,"So on they sped, steering close to the tall cliff under which Scylla"
3718,II,"lay hid, and gazing fearfully at the boiling whirlpool on the other"
3719,II,"side. Just as they passed, a huge column of water shot into the air,"
3720,II,"belched up from the vast maw of Charybdis, and the galley was half"
3721,II,"swamped under a fountain of falling water. When that ended, a black"
3722,II,"yawning chasm appeared, the very throat, as it seemed, of Charybdis,"
3723,II,into which the water rushed in a roaring torrent.
3724,II,
3725,II,Odysseus was gazing intently at this wondrous sight when he heard a
3726,II,"sharp cry, and, looking back he saw six of his men, the stoutest of"
3727,II,"the crew, dangling high in the air, firmly clutched in the six"
3728,II,"sharklike jaws of Scylla. There they hung for a moment, like fishes"
3729,II,just caught by the angler's hook; the next instant they were dragged
3730,II,"into the black mouth of the cavern, calling with their last breath on"
3731,II,their leader's name. This was the most pitiful thing that Odysseus had
3732,II,"ever beheld, in all his long years of travel on the sea."
3733,II,
3734,III,III
3735,III,
3736,III,"The last trial was now at hand, and if they could stand this final"
3737,III,test a happy home-coming was promised to them all. By next day's dawn
3738,III,"they ran down to the fair isle of Helios, and as they drew near they"
3739,III,heard the lowing of oxen and the bleating of sheep. Then Odysseus
3740,III,"remembered the warnings of Circe and Teiresias, and sought to persuade"
3741,III,his men to sail past the island and fly from the reach of temptation.
3742,III,"But they murmured against him, and Eurylochus, his lieutenant, gave"
3743,III,"voice to their feelings thus: ""Thou man of iron, thou hast no pity on"
3744,III,"us, but thinkest that we are all as hardy and as strong as thou art."
3745,III,"Hungry and weary as we are, wouldst thou have us turn away from this"
3746,III,"fair isle, where we could prepare a comfortable meal, and take"
3747,III,refreshing sleep? Shall we add the horrors of night to the horrors of
3748,III,"the sea, and confront the demons of storm that haunt the caverns of"
3749,III,"darkness? Nay, suffer us to abide here to-night, and to-morrow we will"
3750,III,"hoist sail again."""
3751,III,
3752,III,Odysseus saw by the looks of his men that it would be useless to
3753,III,"strain his authority, and so he gave way, though with sore reluctance,"
3754,III,only exacting a solemn oath from the whole company that they would
3755,III,keep their hands off the cattle of Helios. When each in turn had taken
3756,III,"the oath they landed on the shore of a sheltered bay, and encamped by"
3757,III,a fair spring of fresh water.
3758,III,
3759,III,"During the night it began to blow hard, and early next morning, as the"
3760,III,"weather was still stormy and the wind contrary, they hauled up their"
3761,III,"galley and bestowed her in a roomy cave, beyond the reach of wind and"
3762,III,"water. Odysseus repeated his warnings, and the crew then dispersed, to"
3763,III,while away the time until the weather should mend.
3764,III,
3765,III,For a whole month they had nothing but contrary gales from the south
3766,III,"and east, and long before that time had run out they had come to the"
3767,III,end of their store of provisions. For some time they contrived to live
3768,III,"on the fish which they caught by angling from the rocks, though this"
3769,III,was but poor fare for the robust appetites of those heroic days.
3770,III,
3771,III,All this time Odysseus kept a careful watch over the movements of his
3772,III,"men, fearing that they might be driven by hunger to break the oath"
3773,III,which they had taken. But one morning he wandered away to a distant
3774,III,"part of the island, that he might spend an hour in solitary prayer and"
3775,III,"meditation. Having found a secluded spot, he washed his hands, and"
3776,III,"prayed earnestly to the gods for succour: and when he had prayed,"
3777,III,heaven so ordered it that he fell into a deep sleep.
3778,III,
3779,III,"Then the demon of mischief entered into the heart of Eurylochus, a"
3780,III,"factious knave, who had more than once thwarted the counsels of"
3781,III,"Odysseus. ""Comrades,"" he said, ""let us make an end of this misery."
3782,III,"Death in any shape is loathly to us poor mortals, but death by hunger"
3783,III,"is the most hideous of all. Come, let us take the choicest of the"
3784,III,"herds of Helios, and feast upon them, after sacrifice to the gods."
3785,III,"When we return to Ithaca we will build a temple to Helios, and appease"
3786,III,him with rich offerings. And even though he choose to wreck our ship
3787,III,"and drown us all, I would rather swallow the brine, and so make an"
3788,III,"end, than waste away by inches on a desert island."""
3789,III,
3790,III,"The famishing sailors lent a ready ear to his words, and having picked"
3791,III,out the fattest of the oxen they slaughtered them and offered
3792,III,"sacrifice, plucking the leaves of an oak as a substitute for the"
3793,III,"barley-meal for sprinkling between the horns of the victims, and"
3794,III,pouring libations of water instead of wine. When the vain rite was
3795,III,"finished, they spitted slices of the meat, and roasted them over the"
3796,III,glowing embers.
3797,III,
3798,III,"Meanwhile Odysseus had awakened from his sleep, and made his way, not"
3799,III,"without forebodings of ill, back to the camp. As he approached, the"
3800,III,"steam of roasting meat was borne to his nostrils. ""Woe is me!"" he"
3801,III,"cried, ""the deed is done! What a price must we now pay for one hour of"
3802,III,"sleep."""
3803,III,
3804,III,"Vengeance, indeed, was already prepared. Helios received prompt news"
3805,III,of the sacrilege from one of the nymphs who had charge of his flocks
3806,III,"and herds, and hastened to Olympus to demand speedy punishment for the"
3807,III,"transgressors, vowing that if they escaped he would leave the earth in"
3808,III,darkness and carry the lamp of day to the nether world. Zeus promised
3809,III,"that the retribution should be swift and complete, and Helios"
3810,III,"thereupon returned immediately to his daily round, knowing full well"
3811,III,that the father of gods would keep his word.
3812,III,
3813,III,When Odysseus entered the camp he rebuked his men bitterly for their
3814,III,"impiety. But no words, and no repentance, could now repair the"
3815,III,"mischief; the cattle were slain, and in that very hour dire portents"
3816,III,"occurred, to show them the enormity of their crime. A strange moaning"
3817,III,"sound, like the lowing of kine, came from the meat on the spits, and"
3818,III,the hides of the slaughtered beasts crawled and writhed.
3819,III,
3820,III,In spite of these dreadful omens they continued for six days to feast
3821,III,"upon the herds of Helios. On the seventh day the wind blew fair, and"
3822,III,they launched their vessel and continued their voyage. The last
3823,III,vestige of the island had hardly been lost to view when the sky became
3824,III,"black with clouds, and a violent squall struck the ship, snapping her"
3825,III,"mast, which fell upon the helmsman, and dashed out his brains. A"
3826,III,"moment after, a deafening peal of thunder broke overhead, and the"
3827,III,"avenging bolt of Zeus fell upon the ship, scattering her timbers, and"
3828,III,strewing the charred carcasses of the crew upon the waves.
3829,III,
3830,III,"Odysseus alone escaped with his life from that tremendous stroke, and"
3831,III,"clinging to a spar floated all day, until he came in sight of the"
3832,III,strait between Scylla and Charybdis. By the favour of heaven he was
3833,III,"once more preserved from this great peril, and on the tenth day after"
3834,III,the loss of his vessel he was thrown ashore by the waves on the island
3835,III,of Calypso.

3844,I,"The last farewell has been spoken, the good ship is loosed from her"
3845,I,"moorings, and Alcinous is standing on the quay, surrounded by the"
3846,I,"nobles of Phæacia, to bid his illustrious guest god-speed. The picked"
3847,I,"crew bend to their oars, and the galley leaps forward, like a mettled"
3848,I,steed who knows his master's voice. The setting sun is just gilding
3849,I,the towers of the city as they cross the harbour bar. Swift as a
3850,I,"falcon the magic vessel skims over the swelling waters, and the"
3851,I,toil-worn hero lays him down to rest on a soft couch prepared for him
3852,I,"in the stern. Then a deep and deathlike sleep falls upon him, and he"
3853,I,"lies breathing gently as an infant, while the soft southern breeze"
3854,I,plays with his dark clustering hair.
3855,I,
3856,I,"There is a certain haven in the island of Ithaca, protected by two"
3857,I,"lofty headlands, leaving a narrow passage between them. Within, the"
3858,I,"water is so still that ships lie there without moorings, safe and"
3859,I,"motionless. At the head of the haven is a long-leaved olive-tree,"
3860,I,"overshadowing a cool and pleasant cave, sacred to the ""Nymphs called"
3861,I,"Naiads, of the running brooks.""[1] Inside the cave are bowls and"
3862,I,"pitchers of stone, and great stone looms, at which the Naiads weave"
3863,I,their fine fabrics of sea-purple dye. It is a favourite haunt of the
3864,I,"honey-bee, whose murmurs mingled with the splashing of perennial"
3865,I,springs make drowsy music in the place. There are two gates to the
3866,I,"cavern, one towards the north, where mortal feet may pass, and the"
3867,I,"other on the south side, which none may enter save the gods alone."

3870,I,
3871,I,"The day-star was gazing on that still, glassy mere as the Phæacians"
3872,I,steered between the sentinel cliffs and drove their galley ashore in
3873,I,"front of the cave. They lifted Odysseus, still sleeping, from the"
3874,I,"stern, and laid him down gently, couch and all, on the sand. Then they"
3875,I,"brought all the rich gifts, and set them down by the root of the"
3876,I,"olive-tree, out of the reach of any chance wayfarer; and having"
3877,I,"bestowed all safely they launched their ship, and started on their"
3878,I,voyage home.
3879,I,
3880,I,But they were destined to pay dear for their good service to the
3881,I,"stranger. Poseidon marked their course with a jealous eye, and he went"
3882,I,"to his brother, Zeus, and thus preferred his complaint: ""Behold now"
3883,I,"this man hath reached home in safety and honour, and brought the oath"
3884,I,"to naught which I sware against him, when I vowed that he should"
3885,I,"return to Ithaca in evil plight! Is my power to be defied, and my"
3886,I,"worship slighted, by these Phæacians, who are of mine own race?"""

3892,I,"Having thus obtained his brother's consent, Poseidon went and took his"
3893,I,"stand by the harbour mouth at Phæacia, and as soon as the vessel drew"

3899,II,Twilight had not yielded to day when Odysseus awoke from his
3900,II,"trancelike sleep, and gazed in bewilderment around him. His senses had"
3901,II,"not yet fully come back to him, and after his twenty years' absence he"
3902,II,"knew not where he was. All seemed strange--the winding paths, the"
3903,II,"harbour, the cliffs, and the very trees. With a cry of dismay he"
3904,II,"sprang to his feet, and cried aloud: ""Good lack, what land have I come"
3905,II,"to now, and who be they that dwell there? Are they savage and rude, or"
3906,II,"gentle and hospitable to strangers?"" Then his eye fell on the gifts"
3907,II,which had been brought with him from Phæacia. What was he to do with
3908,II,"all this wealth? ""Now this is a sorry trick which the Phæacians have"
3909,II,"played me,"" he muttered again, ""to carry me to a strange land, when"
3910,II,"they had promised to convey me safe to Ithaca."""
3911,II,
3912,II,So unworthily did Odysseus deem of his benefactors that he fell to
3913,II,"counting his goods, for fear lest they should have carried off a"
3914,II,"portion of the gifts while he slept. He found the tale complete, and"
3915,II,when he had finished counting them he wandered disconsolate along the
3916,II,"sand, mourning for the country which he thought still far away. As he"
3917,II,"went thus, with heavy steps and downcast eyes, a shadow fell across"
3918,II,"his path, and looking up he saw a fair youth, clad and armed like a"
3919,II,"young prince, who stood before him and smiled in his face with kindly"
3920,II,"eyes. Glad to meet anyone of so friendly an aspect, Odysseus greeted"
3921,II,"him, asked for his countenance and protection, and inquired the name"
3922,II,of the country.
3923,II,
3924,II,"""Either thou art simple,"" answered the youth, ""or thy home is far"
3925,II,"away, if thou knowest not this land. It is a place not unknown to"
3926,II,"fame, but named with honour wherever mortal speech is heard. Rugged"
3927,II,"indeed it is, and unfit for horses and for chariots, but rich in corn"
3928,II,"and wine, and blessed by the soft rain of heaven. On its green"
3929,II,"pastures roam countless flocks and herds, and streams pour their"
3930,II,abundance from its forest-clad hills. Therefore the name of Ithaca is
3931,II,"spoken far and wide, and hath reached even to the distant land of"
3932,II,"Troy."""
3933,II,
3934,II,The wanderer's heart burned within him when he heard his dear native
3935,II,island described with such loving praise. But dissembling his joy he
3936,II,"set his nimble wits to work, and began to spin a fine fiction for the"
3937,II,"stranger's ear. ""I have heard of Ithaca,"" he said, ""as thou sayest,"
3938,II,"even in Troy, where I fought under Idomeneus, King of Crete. And now I"
3939,II,"am an exile, flying from the vengeance of Idomeneus, whose son,"
3940,II,"Orsilochus, I slew, because he sought to deprive me of my share in the"
3941,II,"Trojan spoil. For he bore a grudge against me, because I would not pay"
3942,II,"court to his father at Troy, but made a party of my own, and fought"
3943,II,"for my own hand. For him I laid an ambush, and slew him in a secret"
3944,II,"place, under cover of night. Then I fled down to the sea, and bribed"
3945,II,the crew of a Phoenician ship to carry me and my goods to Pylos. But
3946,II,"the storm wind drove them out of their course, and they put in here"
3947,II,"for shelter. Sore battered and weary we landed here, having hardly"
3948,II,escaped with our lives; and while I slept they brought my goods
3949,II,"ashore, and sailed away for Sidon, leaving me alone with my sorrow."""
3950,II,
3951,II,"Intent on his tale, Odysseus had not noticed the sudden change which"
3952,II,"had come over his hearer; for his eyes had been turned away, as he"
3953,II,"strove to spell out the features of the country, which still seemed"
3954,II,"unfamiliar. Now he looked round again, and instead of that dainty"
3955,II,"youth he saw a stately female form, tall and fair, in aspect like the"
3956,II,mighty goddess Athene. And in truth it was the daughter of Zeus
3957,II,"herself who answered him, smiling and touching him with a playful"
3958,II,"gesture. ""Thou naughty rogue!"" she said, ""wilt thou never forget thy"
3959,II,"cunning shifts, wherein none can surpass thee, no, not the gods"
3960,II,"themselves? Yea, thou hast a knavish wit, and no man can equal thee in"
3961,II,"craft, as no god can rival me. Yet for all thy skill thou knewest me"
3962,II,"not for Pallas Athene, who is ever near thee in all thy trials, and"
3963,II,made thee dear to all the Phæacians. And now am I come to help thee
3964,II,"hide thy goods, and weave a plot to ensnare the foes who beset thy"
3965,II,"house. Thou hast still much to endure, before thy final triumph, and"
3966,II,"thou must enter thy halls as a stranger, and suffer many things by the"
3967,II,"hands of violent men."""
3968,II,
3969,II,"""It is hard, O goddess,"" answered Odysseus, ""for a mortal man to know"

3971,II,"shapes. Yet well I know that thou wast kind to me in days of old, when"
3972,II,I fought with the Greeks at Troy. But since that time I have never
3973,II,"seen thee, in all my wanderings and perils, save once in Phæacia. Now"
3974,II,"tell me truly, I implore thee, what is this place where I am"
3975,II,"wandering? Thou saidst 'twas Ithaca, but in that I think thou speakest"
3976,II,"falsely, with intent to deceive me; or is this indeed my native land?"""
3977,II,
3978,II,"""Ever the same Odysseus as of old,"" said Athene, smiling again,"
3979,II,"""cautious and wary, and hard to convince. Verily thou art a man after"

3982,II,after so many years of wandering; but thou must needs prove her and
3983,II,"make trial of her constancy, before thou takest her to thy heart. And"
3984,II,"if thou wouldst know why I held aloof from thee so long, it was"
3985,II,"because of Poseidon, my father's brother, who ever pursued thee with"
3986,II,"his ire. Yet I knew that thou wouldst return at last, and have waited"
3987,II,"patiently for that hour, And now I will open thine eyes, that thou"
3988,II,"mayest know the land of thy birth."""
3989,II,
3990,II,"As she spoke she touched his eyes, and a mist seemed to fall away from"
3991,II,"them, so that he recognised every feature of the place, the slopes of"
3992,II,"Neritus, waving with forest trees, the spreading olive-tree, the"
3993,II,"harbour, and the cavern where he had many a time sacrificed to the"
3994,II,"nymphs. Then Odysseus rejoiced in spirit, and kneeling down he kissed"
3995,II,"his native soil, and put up a prayer to the guardian deities of the"
3996,II,"place: ""Greeting, lovely Naiads, maiden daughters of Zeus! Ne'er hoped"
3997,II,"I to see your faces again, Give ear unto my prayer, and if I live and"
3998,II,"prosper by the favour of Athene I will pay you rich offerings, as I"
3999,II,"was wont to do."""
4000,II,
4001,II,"""Doubt not my good-will,"" said Athene, when he had finished; ""that is"

4003,II,"hiding-place. After that we will advise what is next to be done."""
4004,II,
4005,II,"With that she dived into the cave, closely followed by Odysseus, and"
4006,II,showed him where he best might conceal his treasure. When all was
4007,II,"safely bestowed, she set a great stone in the mouth of the cavern, and"
4008,II,"sat down at the foot of the olive-tree, motioning Odysseus to take his"
4009,II,"place at her side. ""Now mark my words,"" began Athene, ""thou hast a"
4010,II,"heavy task before thee, to purge thy house of the shameless crew who"
4011,II,"for three years past have held the mastery there, and sought to tempt"
4012,II,thy wife from her loyalty to thee. All this time she has been putting
4013,II,"them off with promises which she has no mind to fulfil."""
4014,II,
4015,II,"""Tis well,"" answered Odysseus, ""that thou hast warned me; else had I"
4016,II,"fallen in my own hall, even as Agamemnon fell. But come, contrive some"
4017,II,"cunning device, whereby I may avenge me, and be thou at my side to aid"
4018,II,"me, that my heart fail me not. Pour into me the same might and the"
4019,II,same valour as when we sacked Priam's royal citadel; then should I
4020,II,"fear nothing, though I fought single-handed against three hundred"
4021,II,"men."""
4022,II,
4023,II,"""I will not fail thee, of that be sure,"" replied Athene, ""when the"
4024,II,time comes to enter on that task. They shall pay full dear for thy
4025,II,"substance which they devour, even with their very blood and brains,"
4026,II,which shall be shed upon the ground like water. But thou must not
4027,II,appear among them in this fashion. I will give thee a disguise which
4028,II,"none can penetrate, not even Penelope herself. And when thou leavest"
4029,II,"this place, go first to the swineherd, who abides ever by his charge,"
4030,II,faithful to thee and to thy house. Thou wilt find him sitting by the
4031,II,"swine on their feeding ground, near Raven's Rock and the fountain"
4032,II,"Arethusa, where there is abundance of acorns and fair water. Remain"
4033,II,"there and inquire of him concerning all things, while I go to Sparta"
4034,II,"to summon Telemachus, thy son, who went to visit Menelaus to ask news"
4035,II,"of thee."""
4036,II,
4037,II,"""Why didst thou permit him to go on a vain errand?"" asked Odysseus."
4038,II,"""Was it that he might suffer as I have suffered, in wandering o'er the"

4040,II,
4041,II,"""Be not over anxious for him,"" answered Athene; ""I myself sent him on"
4042,II,"that quest, that he might win a good name among men. And now he sits"
4043,II,"secure in the wealthy house of Menelaus, dwelling in luxury and"
4044,II,honour. The wooers have laid an ambush against his return; but all
4045,II,"their malice shall be brought to naught."""
4046,II,
4047,II,It was now time for Odysseus to start on his way to the swineherd. But
4048,II,first he had to submit to a strange transformation. Athene touched him
4049,II,"with a rod which she was carrying, and instantly the flesh shrivelled"
4050,II,"on his limbs, the clustering locks fell away from his head, and the"
4051,II,"keen, piercing glance of his eyes was quenched. He who a moment before"
4052,II,"had been a mighty man in his prime was now become a wrinkled, aged"
4053,II,"beggar, clad in miserable, grimy rags, with a staff, and a tattered"
4054,II,"scrip, hanging by a cord from his shoulder. For a cloak she gave him"
4055,II,"an old deer's hide, from which all the hair was gone. Thus totally"
4056,II,"disguised, he parted from the goddess, and started inland, following a"
4057,II,"rugged mountain path, while Athene went to summon Telemachus from"
4058,II,Sparta.

4066,I,I
4067,I,
4068,I,The office of swineherd was a position of great trust and importance
4069,I,among the patriarchal chieftains of Homeric Greece. The principal diet
4070,I,"was the flesh of swine and oxen, and these animals formed the chief"
4071,I,"part of their wealth. Eumæus, the chief swineherd of Odysseus, lived"
4072,I,"apart in a lonely place among the hills, where he had enclosed a wide"
4073,I,"space of ground with a stone fence defended at the top with brambles,"
4074,I,"and in front by a palisade of oak. Within the fence were twelve styes,"
4075,I,and in each stye were fifty sows with their young. The boars had their
4076,I,"quarters outside the enclosure, and their number had been greatly"
4077,I,diminished by the constant demand for hog's flesh among the suitors.
4078,I,"Still, they reached the formidable total of three hundred and fifty--a"
4079,I,noisy and ravenous multitude.
4080,I,
4081,I,"It was no light task to provide shelter for nearly a thousand swine,"
4082,I,with their young; yet Eumæus had undertaken this duty during his
4083,I,"master's long absence, without the knowledge of Laertes or Penelope."
4084,I,"And here he was sitting, on this sunny morning, cutting up a"
4085,I,"well-tanned ox-hide to make straps for sandals, while four dogs, large"
4086,I,"and fierce as wolves, prowled near at hand. Three of his helpers were"
4087,I,"gone with the swine to their feeding ground, and the fourth had been"
4088,I,sent to the town with a fat hog for the wooers.
4089,I,
4090,I,"Suddenly the dogs rushed forward, baying furiously, and an old man in"
4091,I,tattered raiment appeared at the gate of the courtyard. It would have
4092,I,gone hard with the stranger if Eumæus had not promptly come to the
4093,I,"rescue, and driven the dogs off with a volley of stones. ""Old man,"""
4094,I,"said Eumæus, as the dogs slunk away yelping, ""it was well that I was"
4095,I,"near, or thou hadst surely been torn to pieces, and brought shame on"
4096,I,"me. I have trouble enough without that. Here I sit, fattening my"
4097,I,"master's swine for other men's tables, while he wanders, perchance,"
4098,I,"among strangers, in poverty and want. But come into my hut, and when"
4099,I,thou hast comforted thy soul with meat and wine thou shalt tell thy
4100,I,"tale of sorrow."""
4101,I,
4102,I,"Odysseus (for he it was, though sorely disfigured) followed Eumæus"
4103,I,"into the hut, and sat down on a shaggy goatskin, which the swineherd"
4104,I,"spread for him on a heap of brushwood. ""Heaven bless thee,"" he said,"
4105,I,"when he was seated, ""for this kindly welcome!"" ""I do but my duty,"""
4106,I,"answered Eumæus. ""The stranger and the beggar are sacred, by law"
4107,I,"divine. 'Tis but little that I can do, who serve young and haughty"
4108,I,"masters, in the absence of my true lord, who would have rewarded me"
4109,I,"nobly, and given me a plot of ground and a wife, had he been here to"
4110,I,see how Heaven blesses the work of my hands. But he is gone to swell
4111,I,"the host of those who fell in Helen's cause. Cursed be she, and all"
4112,I,"her race, for she hath robbed me of the kindest master that ever man"
4113,I,"served."""
4114,I,
4115,I,"In the midst of his sorrow, Eumæus forgot not his duties as host."
4116,I,"Going out he took two young swine, slaughtered and dressed them, and"
4117,I,"set the flesh, all smoking on the spits, before Odysseus. Then he"
4118,I,"mixed wine in a bowl of ivy wood, and sitting down opposite to his"
4119,I,guest bade him eat and drink.
4120,I,
4121,I,"""'Tis but poor fare which I have to offer you,"" he said. ""The best of"
4122,I,the herd ever goes to the young lords who are wooing my mistress.
4123,I,Their wantonness and riot calls aloud to Heaven for vengeance. They
4124,I,are worse than the wildest band of robbers that ever lived by open
4125,I,pillage and violence. Such waste of good meat and wine was never seen
4126,I,"before. For a wealthy man was Odysseus, and his flocks and herds still"
4127,I,range over all the hills of Ithaca. And from every flock the fattest
4128,I,and the choicest is driven off day by day to feed their dainty
4129,I,"mouths."""
4130,I,
4131,I,"Odysseus fell to with keen appetite, for he had eaten nothing since he"
4132,I,left Phæacia. And when he had satisfied his hunger he pledged Eumæus
4133,I,"in a full cup, and led him on to discourse on his favourite theme--the"
4134,I,"virtues and the sorrows of his lord. ""Tell me more,"" he said, ""of thy"
4135,I,"master. Who knows but that I may have met him in my travels, for I"
4136,I,"have wandered in many lands."""

4138,I,"""Old man,"" answered Eumæus, ""I see thy bent. Thou wouldst forge some"
4139,I,"glozing tale to beguile the ears of that poor stricken lady, Penelope."
4140,I,Many a beggar has come to her doors crammed full of lies to amuse her
4141,I,"widowed heart; and she listens, and doubts, and weeps. And thou too,"
4142,I,"methinks, hast a like fertile fancy; for hunger and want are rare"

4144,I,"bring him back to life, or clothe with warm flesh his bones, long"
4145,I,since picked clean by carrion birds or ravenous fish. He is lost for
4146,I,"ever, and sorrow is the portion of us who remain, but especially of"

4153,I,my words are proved true by the event I will claim my reward. Odysseus
4154,I,"is near at hand, and ere many days have passed he shall be seen in"

4167,I,
4168,I,Eumæus had not extolled the fertile invention of Odysseus for nothing.
4169,I,"Forthwith he began a wondrous tale of adventure, a little epic in"

4175,I,"see me now, that I was once a mighty man of war; yet even in the"
4176,I,stubble we may judge what the wheat has been. From my youth up I lived
4177,I,"amidst the clash of shield and spear, and loved battle and ambush,"
4178,I,"siege and foray. But I cared not for plodding industry, which gives"

4231,I,"villain, and be devised evil against me; for when we left the coast of"
4232,I,"Thesprotia, he stripped me of the raiment which the king had given me,"
4233,I,"clothed me in these rags, and bound me with cords, intending to sell"
4234,I,"me as a slave. In the evening he landed in Ithaca, leaving me, bound"
4235,I,"as I was, in the ship. But I broke my bonds, and escaped by swimming"
4236,I,"to another part of the coast, where I lay all night in a thicket. In"
4237,I,"the morning they sought me with great outcry, but found me not; and"
4238,I,"after awhile they sailed away. When they were gone I arose, and was"
4239,I,"led by Heaven's hand to thy doors."""
4240,I,
4241,I,"The swineherd listened attentively to the well-imagined tale, and when"
4242,I,"it was ended he said: ""Hapless man, thou hast been the very sport of"
4243,I,"Destiny, and my heart is big when I think of thy wanderings and thy"
4244,I,"woes. But as touching Odysseus, that part of thy story likes me not;"
4245,I,methinks 'tis a cunning invention to flatter my ears. Long ago I was
4246,I,"deceived by a false report, brought hither by a wandering exile like"
4247,I,"thee, who said that he had seen Odysseus repairing his ships in Crete,"
4248,I,and bade us look for his coming in the autumn of that year. Since then
4249,I,"I have closed my ears against all such rumours, and therefore I say,"
4250,I,"tell me no more of him, for I cannot and will not believe but that he"
4251,I,"is dead."""
4252,I,
4253,II,II
4254,II,
4255,II,"Evening was now coming on, and it was time for the herdsmen to return"
4256,II,"with their charge from the feeding-ground. Presently, with huge"
4257,II,"commotion, and multitudinous din, the swine were driven home and"
4258,II,"penned in their styes. Then Eumæus called to his helpers, and bade"
4259,II,them bring the best of the herd to make savoury meat for his guest
4260,II,"""Spare not,"" he said, ""to bring the fattest and choicest of them all,"
4261,II,"for why should we be careful, when strangers devour our labour?"" So"
4262,II,"they brought a hog of five years old, exceeding fat, and having"
4263,II,"slaughtered it they offered sacrifice, not forgetting a prayer for the"
4264,II,"return of Odysseus. When all rites of religion were duly paid, they"
4265,II,"roasted the flesh, and served it on wooden platters. Odysseus was"
4266,II,honoured by Eumæus with a choice portion of the loin.
4267,II,
4268,II,"When they had finished, night came on, dark and stormy, with furious"
4269,II,"gusts of rain and wind. Just as they were about to retire to rest,"
4270,II,"Odysseus, who seldom spoke without a purpose, turned to his kind host"
4271,II,"and said: ""Eumæus, the good wine has loosened my tongue, and moved me"
4272,II,"to tell thee a story of long ago, when these withered limbs were in"
4273,II,"their lusty prime, and my heart burned with the fire of youth. Then I"
4274,II,was chosen with Menelaus and Odysseus to lead an ambush under the
4275,II,walls of Troy. With a picked company we took up our position in a
4276,II,"marshy place, and lay down in our armour among the rushes. It was a"
4277,II,"bitter night, with snow and frost, and our shields were soon coated"
4278,II,"with ice. Now it chanced that I had left my cloak in the camp, and"
4279,II,"while the others lay warm in their thick woollen mantles, I was"
4280,II,"perishing with cold. At last I could bear it no longer, so I nudged"
4281,II,"Odysseus, who was lying next to me, with my elbow, and said to him:"
4282,II,"'Son of Laertes, the cold is killing me. I came in my folly without a"
4283,II,"cloak, and I can never hold out until dawn in this cruel frost.' And"
4284,II,"he, ever ready of wit as he was, instantly contrived means to relieve"
4285,II,"me. Whispering to me to keep counsel he rose on his elbow, and called"
4286,II,"to the others, saying: 'Comrades, I have been warned in a dream that"
4287,II,our numbers are too weak for the task which has been laid upon us.
4288,II,"Will not one of you run down to the camp, and ask Agamemnon to send us"
4289,II,further succour?'
4290,II,
4291,II,"""Thereupon one of our men arose, and flinging off his cloak ran off to"
4292,II,"carry the message to Agamemnon. And I lay wrapped in the garment, warm"
4293,II,"and safe, until the dawn. Ah! those were brave days; what changes have"
4294,II,"I seen since then!"""
4295,II,
4296,II,"""I read thy meaning,"" said Eumæus; ""and as a reward for thy good story"
4297,II,thou shalt sleep in comfort to-night. But to-morrow thou must make
4298,II,"shift to wear thine own rags again, for I am but ill furnished with"
4299,II,changes of raiment. When Telemachus returns he will supply all thy
4300,II,"wants, and send thee whithersoever thou art minded to go."""
4301,II,
4302,II,"So saying he drew a truckle-bed close to the fire, and heaped it with"
4303,II,"the skins of sheep and goats. There Odysseus lay down to rest, and"
4304,II,Eumæus threw over him a stout mantle of his own. All the other
4305,II,"herdsmen slept in the hut; but Eumæus, ever watchful for his master's"
4306,II,"property, went out, armed to the teeth, to pass the night among the"
4307,II,"swine, under the shelter of a hollow rock, which kept off the cold"
4308,II,north wind. And Odysseus was glad when he saw that good servant so
4309,II,faithful to his trust.

4318,I,
4319,I,"While these important events were happening in Ithaca, Telemachus was"
4320,I,"living as an honoured guest in the house of Menelaus. One night, while"
4321,I,"he lay between sleeping and waking, full of anxious thought, Athene"
4322,I,"appeared to him in her own person, and addressed him thus: ""Thou"
4323,I,"lingerest too long here, Telemachus. It is time for thee to return and"
4324,I,"keep an eye on thy goods, lest thou be stripped of all in thy absence."
4325,I,"Thy mother's kinsmen are urgent with her to wed Eurymachus, the"
4326,I,"wealthiest of the wooers; and, if she yield, it may be that she will"
4327,I,take of thy heritage to increase the house of the man who wins her.
4328,I,"Therefore make haste and get thee home, that thou mayest be at hand to"
4329,I,defend thy rights. Know also that the wooers are lying in wait for
4330,I,"thee in the strait between Ithaca and Samos, with intent to slay thee;"
4331,I,"take heed then that thou shun that passage, and sail home by another"
4332,I,"way. And when thou art come to Ithaca, go straight to the dwelling of"
4333,I,"Eumæus, and send him down to Penelope with news of thy return."""
4334,I,
4335,I,"Such a message, brought by such a messenger, was not to be neglected."
4336,I,"Telemachus at once roused Pisistratus, the son of Nestor, who was"
4337,I,"sleeping near, and declared his intention of starting at once; but"
4338,I,when Pisistratus pointed out how displeasing such conduct would be to
4339,I,their princely host he consented to wait till morning.
4340,I,
4341,I,"Accordingly, when day was come, he went to Menelaus, and asked leave"
4342,I,"to depart at once. Menelaus consented, only insisting that he should"
4343,I,"remain for the morning meal. While this was preparing, the generous"
4344,I,"prince went to his treasure chamber, and returned laden with a"
4345,I,"splendid silver bowl, the work of Phoenician artists, which he had"
4346,I,received when he visited the King of Sidon on his voyage from Troy.
4347,I,"And Helen brought an embroidered robe, the work of her own fair hands,"
4348,I,as a wedding gift for his future bride.
4349,I,
4350,I,"As soon as they had eaten they mounted the chariot, and drove slowly"
4351,I,"through the outer gate of the courtyard, Menelaus and Helen following"
4352,I,"on foot Here they drew up to say farewell, and Menelaus pledged them"
4353,I,"in a bowl of wine, wishing them god-speed. ""And forget not,"" he added,"
4354,I,"""to greet Nestor for me when ye come to Pylos, for he was ever gentle"
4355,I,"to me as a father when we sojourned in the land of Troy."""
4356,I,
4357,I,"""I will not forget to carry thy message,"" answered Telemachus; ""would"
4358,I,"that I were as sure to see my father when I come to Ithaca, that I"
4359,I,"might tell him of thy noble hospitality, and show him thy gifts."""
4360,I,
4361,I,"Hardly had the words been uttered when a clamour of voices was heard,"
4362,I,"and a crowd of men and women ran past, pursuing with loud cries an"
4363,I,"eagle, which had just seized a great white goose from the courtyard,"
4364,I,and was carrying her off in his talons. Straight over the chariot he
4365,I,"flew, and with a scream of triumph sped away to the mountains with his"
4366,I,"booty. ""Consider now, my prince,"" said Pisistratus, ""whether this omen"
4367,I,"was sent to us or to thee."""
4368,I,
4369,I,"Menelaus, who was somewhat slow of wit, paused to deliberate; but"
4370,I,"before he could frame an answer, the quick brain of Helen was ready"
4371,I,"with an interpretation. ""The eagle is thy father, Odysseus,"" she said"
4372,I,"to Telemachus, ""and the meaning of the omen is that he is already in"
4373,I,"Ithaca, or close at hand, bringing death and doom to his foes."""
4374,I,
4375,I,"Thus encouraged by fair portents, they took leave of their kind hosts,"
4376,I,"and started on their way to Pylos, where they arrived on the following"
4377,I,"day. As they drew near to the house of Nestor, Telemachus begged his"
4378,I,"friend to drive straight down to the sea. ""For I know,"" he said, ""that"
4379,I,"thy father will constrain me to abide with him, and will take no"
4380,I,"denial; and I wish to embark for Ithaca without further delay."""
4381,I,"Pisistratus agreed, and avoiding the house of Nestor they passed on to"
4382,I,the place where the ship lay moored.
4383,I,
4384,I,"Having summoned his crew, Telemachus was preparing to embark, when a"
4385,I,"man armed and equipped as a traveller approached the vessel, and"
4386,I,inquired who he was and whither he was bound. Having received an
4387,I,"answer, he requested Telemachus to carry him to Ithaca. ""My name,"" he"
4388,I,"said, ""is Theoclymenus, and I am descended from Melampus, the famous"
4389,I,"seer, from whom I have inherited the prophetic gift. I am an exile"
4390,I,"from my native land of Argos, for I have slain a man of my own tribe,"
4391,I,"and am flying from the avenger of blood. Set me, I pray thee, on thy"
4392,I,"ship, and take me with you, for sore is my need."""
4393,I,
4394,I,"""Heaven forbid,"" answered Telemachus, ""that I should deny thee, seeing"
4395,I,"that thy very life is at stake. Make haste, and come on board""; and he"
4396,I,made room for the stranger to sit by him in the stern of the vessel.
4397,I,
4398,I,"After a quick and prosperous voyage they sighted the coast of Ithaca,"
4399,I,and landed on a deserted part of the coast within easy reach of the
4400,I,"swineherd's dwelling. Here Telemachus dismissed his company, bidding"
4401,I,"them take the galley round to the harbour of Ithaca, and promising to"
4402,I,reward them for their good service. He was just about to depart when
4403,I,Theoclymenus detained him and asked where he was to find shelter.
4404,I,"Telemachus answered in some embarrassment. ""'Twere no friendly act,"""
4405,I,"he said, ""to send thee to my house, for my mother lives apart in her"
4406,I,"own chamber and sees no man, and I fear lest thou suffer some harm"
4407,I,from the lawless men who riot in my halls. Therefore I advise thee to
4408,I,"go to Eurymachus, who is now the most powerful man in Ithaca, and"
4409,I,hopes to sit in my father's seat; but perchance Zeus will send him
4410,I,"another issue of his wooing."""
4411,I,
4412,I,"Just as he spoke a rushing of wings was heard on the right, and they"
4413,I,"saw a falcon passing close at hand with a dove clutched in his talons,"
4414,I,and tearing his prey so that the feathers fluttered down at their
4415,I,"feet. Then Theoclymenus, who was deeply skilled in augury, drew"
4416,I,"Telemachus apart and said: ""It is a manifest sign of victory to thee"
4417,I,"and to thy house."" ""May Heaven fulfil thy prophecy,"" answered"
4418,I,"Telemachus, ""and if thy words prove true I will load thee with"
4419,I,"benefits, and give thee cause to bless this hour."" Being now convinced"
4420,I,"that he had found a friend, he called Peiræus, in whom he had full"
4421,I,"confidence, and bade him take Theoclymenus under his care until he"
4422,I,"himself returned to the town. Peiræus readily undertook the charge,"
4423,I,and this point being settled they thrust out from the shore and rowed
4424,I,"away in the direction of the harbour, while Telemachus strode off with"
4425,I,rapid footsteps along the path which led to the swineherd's hut.
4426,I,
4427,II,II
4428,II,
4429,II,On the evening before the arrival of Telemachus Odysseus was sitting
4430,II,"after supper with Eumæus and the other herdsmen, and wishing to learn"
4431,II,"the purpose of Eumæus towards him he said: ""I will no longer be a"
4432,II,burden to thee and thy fellows. To-morrow I will go to the town and
4433,II,"beg my living, if thou wilt send one of thy men to show me the way."
4434,II,"Perchance also I might visit the house of Odysseus, and have speech"
4435,II,with Penelope. And it may be that the wooers will take me into their
4436,II,"service, for I would have thee know that by favour of Hermes I am"
4437,II,"right skilful of my hands, and no one can match me in laying a fire"
4438,II,"and cleaving dry logs, in carving and roasting meat, and in pouring of"
4439,II,"wine."""
4440,II,
4441,II,"But this proposal found no favour with the honest swineherd. ""Who put"
4442,II,"such a thought,"" he asked, ""into thy mind? Serve with the wooers! They"
4443,II,"would put a speedy end to thy service, and pay thee thy wages in"
4444,II,blood. Those who wait upon them are of a different sort from thee--gay
4445,II,"striplings, daintily clad, with glossy hair and comely faces. Remain"
4446,II,with us until Telemachus comes home; thou art no burden either to me
4447,II,"or to my men."""
4448,II,
4449,II,"""Be it so, then,"" answered Odysseus, ""and may Heaven requite thee for"
4450,II,"thy goodness to a poor homeless outcast, who wanders in misery, driven"
4451,II,"by hunger from door to door! And since I am still to be thy guest,"
4452,II,"tell me something of thy master's mother, and of the father whom he"
4453,II,"left behind when he went to the wars. Do they still live, or have they"
4454,II,"gone to their rest?"""
4455,II,
4456,II,"""This also thou shalt know,"" replied Eumæus. ""Laertes his father still"
4457,II,"lives, though sore stricken with years and sorrows; for his son's long"
4458,II,absence and his wife's miserable end have brought him to the verge of
4459,II,"the grave. She died long ago, and by such a death as I pray may never"
4460,II,"come to anyone who is dear to me--she, my kind mistress, who brought"
4461,II,"me up with her youngest daughter, and hardly loved me less. As long as"
4462,II,"she lived I would often go down to the house, and she ever entertained"
4463,II,"me kindly, and gave me something to carry back with me to my dwelling"
4464,II,on the land. Full well she knew how to sweeten the lot of a thrall
4465,II,"with pleasant words, and little acts of tenderness and love. But now I"
4466,II,"seldom leave my charge, for since the wooers brought this curse upon"
4467,II,"my master's house Penelope hides her face from us, and has no comfort"
4468,II,"for us either in word or deed."""
4469,II,
4470,II,"Odysseus listened with deep interest, and when Eumæus paused he"
4471,II,"expressed a desire to hear the story of his life. ""How was it,"" he"
4472,II,"asked, ""that already in early childhood thou wast cast on the mercy of"
4473,II,"strangers? Wast thou taken captive in war, or did robbers seize thee"
4474,II,"as thou satst watching sheep on the lonely hills, and sell thee into"
4475,II,"bondage?"""
4476,II,
4477,II,"""Fill thy cup,"" answered Eumæus, ""we will pledge each other in a"
4478,II,"hearty draught, and then thou shalt hear my tale. The nights are long"
4479,II,"at this season, and we shall have time enough to sleep when I have"
4480,II,"done. Fate has dealt hardly with me, even as with thee; and we can"
4481,II,find some comfort in telling over our sorrows to each other.
4482,II,
4483,II,"""There is a certain island called Syria, lying north of Ortygia, not"
4484,II,"very large or populous, but a good land, rich in pasture, with waving"
4485,II,"cornfields and goodly vineyards. There famine never comes, nor"
4486,II,"sickness, but all the people reach a good old age, and then die by the"
4487,II,painless shafts of Artemis or of Apollo. There are two cities which
4488,II,divide the territory equally between them; and there was one king over
4489,II,"both, my father, Ctesius, son of Ormenus."
4490,II,
4491,II,"""When I was still very young there came to the island a Phoenician"
4492,II,"ship, laden with trinkets for barter. Now in my father's house was a"
4493,II,"Phoenician woman, tall and fair, and skilled in needlework. She was my"
4494,II,"nurse, and I was wont to run about the town with her. One day, as she"
4495,II,"was washing clothes not far from the ship, she was recognised by a"
4496,II,"Phoenician sailor as being of his own race, and he inquired how she"
4497,II,"came to the island. She answered that she was a native of Sidon, and a"
4498,II,"rich man's daughter, stolen from her home by pirates, and sold across"
4499,II,the seas. 'And hast thou a mind to see thy native land again?' asked
4500,II,the fellow. 'Thy father and mother still live and prosper'; for she
4501,II,"had told him that her father's name was Arybas. 'I will go with you,'"
4502,II,"answered the woman, 'if ye will swear an oath to carry me home"
4503,II,"unharmed.' They all swore to do as she said, and after that she"
4504,II,"instructed them how to proceed. 'Keep close counsel,' she said, 'and"
4505,II,"let none of you seem to know me when ye meet me in the street, nor yet"
4506,II,"by the well, lest anyone tell it to my master; for if he suspects that"
4507,II,aught is amiss it will be the ruin of us all. Lose no time in selling
4508,II,"your wares, and when the ship is freighted for her homeward voyage let"
4509,II,one of you come up to the house and give me a sign. I will not come
4510,II,"empty-handed, but will bring with me vessels of gold to pay for my"
4511,II,"passage. Furthermore, I have charge of my master's child, a knowing"
4512,II,"little lad; and, if it be possible, I will bring him with me, that ye"
4513,II,may sell him for a great price.'
4514,II,
4515,II,"""The bargain was struck, and the woman departed. Then for a whole year"
4516,II,"they remained among us and traded; at last, when they had sold out all"
4517,II,"their goods, and stowed their cargo, they sent up a man to my father's"
4518,II,"house, to warn the woman that the time was come. He brought with him a"
4519,II,"necklace of gold and amber, a thing of most rare device; and while my"
4520,II,"mother and her women were handling it, and bargaining for the price,"
4521,II,the fellow made a sign to my nurse. When he was gone she took me by
4522,II,the hand and led me with her into the courtyard before the house.
4523,II,"There she found tables set with vessels of gold, where my father had"
4524,II,been dining with his guests. They had now gone forth to attend the
4525,II,"council, and the place was deserted; so she caught up three goblets"
4526,II,"and hid them in her bosom. Then with one rapid glance round, to make"
4527,II,"sure that she was not observed, she hastened down to the spot where"
4528,II,"the Phoenician ship lay moored; and I, poor child, followed her,"
4529,II,fearing nothing.

4534,II,"springing up from the land, they hoisted sail, and were soon beyond"
4535,II,the reach of pursuit. On the seventh day of the voyage the hand of
4536,II,"vengeance fell upon the woman, and she was struck dead by an invisible"
4537,II,"blow. They flung her body to the fishes, and soon after we landed in"

4576,I,"resume his place, and sat down himself on a heap of brushwood, on"
4577,I,which the swineherd had spread a fleece. While Eumæus was bringing
4578,I,"bread and meat, and filling the cups with wine, Telemachus questioned"
4579,I,"him as to his mother, and learnt that no change had occurred in her"
4580,I,"relation to the wooers since he left Ithaca. Breakfast being over,"
4581,I,"Eumæus, in answer to his inquiry, told him the story of the supposed"
4582,I,"stranger. ""I have done what I could for him,"" he added, when he had"
4583,I,"repeated what he had heard from Odysseus. ""Now I deliver him unto"
4584,I,"thee, to do with him as thou wilt; all his hopes are in thy grace."""
4585,I,
4586,I,"""What can I do?"" answered Telemachus, in perplexity. ""Thou knowest"
4587,I,"that I am not master in my own house, and my mother is torn between"
4588,I,"two purposes: whether to wait still in patience for her lord's coming,"
4589,I,or to choose a new husband from the noblest of the suitors. Neither
4590,I,she nor I can give protection to such a guest as this. Therefore I
4591,I,"will bestow upon him a new cloak and doublet, with sandals for his"
4592,I,"feet, and arm him with a good sword, and send him whithersoever he"
4593,I,"chooses to go. Or if thou art willing, thou canst keep him here with"
4594,I,"thee, and I will send down food and raiment for him, that he may not"
4595,I,be a burden to thee and thy men. But I will not allow him to go among
4596,I,"the wooers, and suffer ill-treatment which I have no power to"
4597,I,"prevent."""
4598,I,
4599,I,"Odysseus, who had not seen his son since he was an infant, desired to"
4600,I,learn something more of his mind and character; and in order to draw
4601,I,"him into further speech he asked, with an air of indignation, who the"
4602,I,"wooers were, and how it was that he submitted to their violence. ""Is"
4603,I,"the public voice against thee,"" he asked, ""or art thou at feud with"
4604,I,"thy brethren, so that they will not help thee? If I were in thy place"
4605,I,"I would fall upon them singlehanded, for it were better to die once"
4606,I,"for all than tamely to submit to such outrage."""
4607,I,
4608,I,"""Behold I will tell thee all the truth,"" answered Telemachus. ""'Tis"
4609,I,neither by the consent of the people nor by the ill-will of my
4610,I,"brethren, that this evil hath come upon me. But Heaven hath ordained"
4611,I,that the honours and the burden of our house should ever rest upon one
4612,I,"alone. Laertes, my grandsire, was an only son, and Odysseus was the"
4613,I,sole issue of his marriage; and even so I am the only child of
4614,I,"Odysseus. Therefore I sit helpless and alone, at the mercy of this"
4615,I,"ruffian band. But enough of this! We have no hope left, save in the"
4616,I,"justice of Heaven."" Then he turned to Eumæus, and said: ""Make haste"
4617,I,"now, go down to the house, and tell Penelope that I have come back"
4618,I,"safe from Pylos. Let none else hear it, but come back hither at once,"
4619,I,"when thou hast delivered thy message, and I will wait here until thy"
4620,I,"return."""
4621,I,
4622,I,"""Shall I not go to Laertes, and tell him also?"" asked the swineherd."
4623,I,"""Since the day of thy departure he has tasted neither meat nor drink,"
4624,I,"but sits alone in his sorrow, and will not be comforted."""
4625,I,
4626,I,"""My mother can send a handmaid to inform him,"" answered Telemachus."
4627,I,"""But as for thee, see that thou return here straightway, and lose no"
4628,I,"time."""
4629,I,
4630,II,II
4631,II,
4632,II,"Soon after the departure of Eumæus, Odysseus and Telemachus were"
4633,II,"sitting before the door of the hut, each lost in his own thoughts,"
4634,II,when their attention was attracted by the strange behaviour of the
4635,II,"dogs. These animals, which had been lying basking in the sun, all at"
4636,II,"once started up with a stifled cry, and ran whining, with every sign"
4637,II,"of terror, to a distant corner of the courtyard. ""What ails the"
4638,II,"hounds?"" said Telemachus, looking up in surprise. But Odysseus was not"
4639,II,long before he saw the cause of their alarm: standing at the outer
4640,II,"gate was a tall female figure, of majestic countenance, and more than"
4641,II,"mortal beauty. Telemachus saw her not, but Odysseus instantly knew who"
4642,II,"she was, and, obeying a gesture of her hand, he rose from his seat and"
4643,II,went out through the gate. She led him to a place where they were out
4644,II,"of hearing, and then said: ""It is time for thee to reveal thyself to"
4645,II,"thy son, that together ye may contrive destruction for the wooers."
4646,II,"When the hour of reckoning comes, I shall be near to aid you."""
4647,II,"Thereupon she touched him with her wand, and in a moment he was once"
4648,II,"more the old Odysseus, still in the full vigour of his manhood, dark"
4649,II,"and sunburnt, with thick black hair and curling beard. His rags also"
4650,II,had been replaced by fair clean raiment; and thus completely
4651,II,transformed he went back to the hut to reveal himself to Telemachus.
4652,II,"Athene, having done her part, had forthwith disappeared."
4653,II,
4654,II,"Fear came upon Telemachus, and he marvelled exceedingly, when the real"
4655,II,"Odysseus appeared before him. ""Who art thou,"" he asked, ""that comest"
4656,II,"back in a moment thus wondrously transfigured? If thou be a god, as"
4657,II,"methinks thou art, let me find favour in thy sight, and we will honour"
4658,II,"thee with rich offerings of gold, and with humble prayers."""
4659,II,
4660,II,"""No god am I,"" answered Odysseus, ""but thine own dear father, for"
4661,II,"whose sake thou hast suffered so long with groanings and tears."""
4662,II,
4663,II,"With that he kissed him, and giving vent to the tenderness which he"
4664,II,had hitherto restrained he lifted up his voice and wept. But
4665,II,Telemachus could not yet believe that it was indeed his father whom he
4666,II,"saw before him. ""It cannot be,"" he said, drawing back in affright. ""It"
4667,II,"is mere magic and glamour practised against me by some hostile power,"
4668,II,to mock my sorrow. No being of flesh and blood could work such a
4669,II,change upon himself. A moment since thou wast an old man in sordid
4670,II,"raiment, and now thou art like unto the sons of heaven."""
4671,II,
4672,II,"""Forbear!"" said Odysseus, ""no more amazement! I am thy father, and no"
4673,II,"other; if not, thou shalt never see him more. Much have I suffered,"
4674,II,"and wandered far, and now in the twentieth year I am come back to my"
4675,II,"native land. This change at which thou marvellest is no work of mine,"
4676,II,"but was wrought by Athene, daughter of Zeus. The gods can deal with us"
4677,II,"as they will, both for our glory and for our shame."""
4678,II,
4679,II,"Then Telemachus was convinced, and fell into his father's arms, and"
4680,II,"they wept long and sore over each other, for joy and grief are near"
4681,II,"neighbours. Presently they grew calmer, and Odysseus, in answer to his"
4682,II,"son's inquiry, told how the Phæacians had conveyed him to Ithaca, and"
4683,II,of all the treasures which he had brought with him.
4684,II,
4685,II,"""But now we must speak of a sterner task,"" said Odysseus, when his"
4686,II,"story was ended. ""Tell me now the number of the wooers, that I may"
4687,II,"know how many and what manner of men they be, and thereafter contrive"
4688,II,"how we may best assail them, whether by ourselves or with others to"
4689,II,"help us."""
4690,II,
4691,II,"""Father,"" answered Telemachus, ""I knew thy high renown, as a warrior"
4692,II,mighty in word and deed. But I fear me greatly that this task is too
4693,II,hard for us; how shall two men prevail against so many? Listen now and
4694,II,"I will tell thee their number. From Dulichium are two and fifty, with"
4695,II,"six men-servants, from Same twenty-four, from Zacynthus twenty, and"
4696,II,"from Ithaca itself twelve, all proper men and tall. If we twain fall"
4697,II,"upon such a host, we may find the work of vengeance a bitter morsel,"
4698,II,"and our bane. It were better, then, to look for some other help."""
4699,II,
4700,II,"""Helpers we shall find, and stout ones too,"" said Odysseus. ""What"
4701,II,"sayest thou to Athene and her father, Zeus? Is their aid enough or"
4702,II,"shall we look for more?"""
4703,II,
4704,II,"""Mighty indeed are the champions thou namest,"" replied Telemachus,"
4705,II,"""though throned far remote among the clouds; supreme are they in"
4706,II,"sovereignty, both on earth and in heaven."""
4707,II,
4708,II,"""Thou sayest well,"" answered Odysseus; ""and ere long the wooers shall"
4709,II,feel their might. Now learn further what thou must do. To-morrow thou
4710,II,"shalt go up to the house, and join the company of the wooers, and"
4711,II,afterwards the swineherd will bring me thither in the disguise of a
4712,II,beggar old and miserable. If the wooers use me despitefully seek not
4713,II,"to prevent it, but let thy heart endure, even though they beat me, or"
4714,II,drag me by the feet through the doors. Thou mayest reprove them
4715,II,"gently, and bid them cease from their wantonness, but they will not"
4716,II,"heed thee for their lives are forfeit already. Mark further, and take"
4717,II,heed what I say. When the time to strike is come I will give thee a
4718,II,"signal, and, forthwith, thou shalt remove all the weapons from the"
4719,II,"halls, and make excuse to the wooers, saying that thou art bestowing"
4720,II,"them in a safe place, out of reach of the smoke. Leave only two swords"
4721,II,"and two shields and two spears, as weapons for ourselves. But above"
4722,II,"all I charge thee to let none know of my coming--neither Laertes, nor"
4723,II,"Eumæus, nor Penelope herself. Alone we must work, and watch the temper"
4724,II,"of the thralls, to see if there be any on our side."""
4725,II,
4726,III,III
4727,III,
4728,III,Meanwhile the faithful swineherd made all haste to carry his message
4729,III,"to Penelope. Just as he was approaching the house, he met one of the"
4730,III,crew of Telemachus' ship coming up from the harbour on the same
4731,III,"errand. So they went together, and while Eumæus conveyed the tidings"
4732,III,"privately to Penelope, he who was sent from the ship delivered his"
4733,III,report in the hearing of the whole household.
4734,III,
4735,III,Great was the dismay of the suitors when they learnt that their foul
4736,III,plot had been frustrated. One by one they stole out of the house to a
4737,III,secret place of meeting; and when they were all assembled they began
4738,III,to devise what was next to be done. While they were debating they were
4739,III,joined by Antinous and the crew of the ship which had been lying in
4740,III,wait for Telemachus in the strait. Always the foremost in violent
4741,III,"counsels, Antinous breathed out threatenings and slaughter against the"
4742,III,"young prince. ""The boy only escaped us by a miracle,"" he said. ""All"
4743,III,"day long we had sentinels on all the heights commanding the sea, and"
4744,III,at night we patrolled the waters in our ship. Yet for all our
4745,III,vigilance he has slipped through our hands. But I will not be baffled
4746,III,"thus,"" he added, stamping with fury. ""This wretched boy must die, or"
4747,III,we shall never accomplish our purpose. Let us make haste and slay him
4748,III,"before he comes back to the town, or he will call a meeting of the"
4749,III,"people and proclaim to all Ithaca that we sought to slay him, and"
4750,III,"failed. Then the whole city will rise against us, and we shall have to"
4751,III,"fly for our lives."""
4752,III,
4753,III,Then another of the wooers rose up and rebuked Antinous for his
4754,III,"bloodthirsty counsels. This man's name was Amphinomus, and he was the"
4755,III,chief among the wooers who came from Dulichium. More than any of the
4756,III,"other suitors he found favour with Penelope, for he was a prudent man"
4757,III,"and a just, and his voice was pleasant to her ear. ""Remember,"" he"
4758,III,"said, ""that Telemachus is of royal race; and it is a dreadful thing to"
4759,III,"shed the blood of kings. I will have no hand in such an act, without"
4760,III,"sure and manifest sign that it is the will of Zeus."""
4761,III,
4762,III,The speech of Amphinomus was received with a murmur of applause; for
4763,III,most of the wooers were averse to the violent measures proposed by
4764,III,"Antinous. So they arose, and returned to the house."
4765,III,
4766,III,"Penelope had heard of their plotting from the herald, Medon, and"
4767,III,"obeying a sudden impulse she came down from her chamber, and standing"
4768,III,"in the doorway began to upbraid Antinous for his wicked purpose. ""Thou"
4769,III,"hast the name of a wise and eloquent man,"" she said, ""but thy fame is"
4770,III,"better than thy deeds. Wretch, why dost thou lay snares against the"
4771,III,life of my son? Hast thou never heard how thy father came to this
4772,III,"house, flying from the wrath of the Ithacans, who would have slain"
4773,III,"him, because he had joined the Taphian pirates in a raid on the"
4774,III,"Thesprotians, who were our allies? But Odysseus stood between him and"
4775,III,"their fury, and saved his life. A fair return thou art making for that"
4776,III,"good service, devouring his substance, paying court to his wife, and"
4777,III,"compassing the death of his son."""
4778,III,
4779,III,"Antinous sat biting his lips, and made no answer; but Eurymachus, a"
4780,III,"subtler villain, smooth and specious, but all the more dangerous,"
4781,III,"spoke for him, and said: ""Sage daughter of Icarius, fear nothing for"
4782,III,"thy son Telemachus, for while I live no man shall offer him violence."
4783,III,"By this sword I swear it, and I care not who hears me, the man who"
4784,III,seeks to harm him shall die by my hand. I at least have not forgotten
4785,III,"the loving-kindness of thy lord, Odysseus, on whose knees I have often"
4786,III,"sat, and taken food and drink from his hand. Therefore I love"
4787,III,"Telemachus as a brother, and I swear to thee that none of the wooers"
4788,III,"shall do him any harm."""

4794,III,
4795,III,
4796,I,I
4797,I,
4798,I,"When Eumæus came back from his errand, Odysseus, who in the meantime"
4799,I,"had resumed his disguise, was helping Telemachus to prepare the"
4800,I,evening meal. Telemachus questioned him about the ship which the
4801,I,"wooers had sent out to waylay him on his return from Pylos, but Eumæus"
4802,I,had been in such haste to get back to his farm that he had not stopped
4803,I,"to inquire about the matter. ""But thus much I can tell thee,"" he said:"
4804,I,"""as I was crossing the hill which overlooks the town I saw a galley,"
4805,I,"bristling with spear and helm, entering the harbour; and I believe"
4806,I,"that this was the ship of which thou speakest"""
4807,I,
4808,I,"""No doubt of it,"" answered Telemachus, with a significant glance at"
4809,I,"his father. Then they all fell to their suppers with hearty appetite,"
4810,I,and soon afterwards retired to rest.
4811,I,
4812,I,The first chill of dawn was still in the air when Telemachus roused
4813,I,"the swineherd, and announced his intention of proceeding at once to"
4814,I,"the town. ""I know,"" he said, ""that my mother will have no peace until"
4815,I,"she sees me with her own eyes. Now as to this stranger, I charge thee"
4816,I,"to take him with thee into the town, that he may beg his bread from"
4817,I,"house to house. Burdened as I am already, and full of care, I cannot"
4818,I,"provide for him. If he thinks it hard, all the worse for him."""
4819,I,
4820,I,"""Thou sayest well,"" answered Odysseus; ""I have no mind to remain here."
4821,I,"I am too old to take orders from a master, and it is better to beg my"
4822,I,"living in the town than in the fields. Therefore I will go, when I"
4823,I,"have warmed me at the fire, and the sun is up; for I am ill equipped"
4824,I,"to face the frosts of morning."""
4825,I,
4826,I,"Away went Telemachus, covering the ground with rapid strides, his mind"
4827,I,occupied all the way with thoughts of vengeance against the wooers.
4828,I,The first who saw him when he crossed the threshold of his home was
4829,I,"his old nurse, Eurycleia, who was just then spreading fleeces on the"
4830,I,seats in the great hall. With a cry of joy she ran and fell on his
4831,I,"neck, and kissed him; and all the faithful handmaids of Penelope"
4832,I,crowded round to welcome their young master home. The sound of their
4833,I,"voices reached the ears of Penelope, and with swift steps she came"
4834,I,"gliding into the hall, fair as Artemis, or golden Aphrodite. When she"
4835,I,saw Telemachus she flung her arms round his neck and covered his face
4836,I,"with kisses. ""Welcome,"" she sobbed, ""Telemachus, my heart's darling,"
4837,I,"restored to me beyond all hope! Say, hast thou brought any news of thy"
4838,I,"father?"""
4839,I,
4840,I,But Telemachus was too full of the stern task which lay before him to
4841,I,leave room for softer emotions. Gently extricating himself from his
4842,I,"mother's embrace he said: ""Dear mother, thou shalt hear all in due"
4843,I,"season; at present I have other work to do. Go thou to thy chamber,"
4844,I,"and put on clean raiment, and when thou hast purified thyself pray to"
4845,I,all the immortal gods to hasten the day of atonement for those who
4846,I,"have wronged our house. I will return presently, when I have done my"
4847,I,"business in the town."""
4848,I,
4849,I,"The gentle Penelope went to do her son's bidding, and Telemachus"
4850,I,"started for the town, with two hounds following close at his heels. He"
4851,I,"seemed taller and manlier after his short absence, and many an eye"
4852,I,followed him with wonder as he passed through the streets. Presently
4853,I,"he came to the place where the wooers were assembled, and they came"
4854,I,crowding about him with false words of welcome. But he turned his back
4855,I,"on them with scorn, and seeing a little group of his father's friends,"
4856,I,"among whom were Mentor and the aged Halitherses, he went and sat down"
4857,I,"among them. While they were questioning him about his travels, Peiræus"
4858,I,"came up, bringing with him the seer, Theoclymenus, whom Telemachus had"
4859,I,"left in his charge the day before. ""I restore to thee thy guest,"" said"
4860,I,"Peiræus, ""who has been entertained in all honour at my house; and if"
4861,I,"thou wilt send thy handmaids, I will deliver unto them the treasure"
4862,I,"which thou hast brought with thee from Pylos."""
4863,I,
4864,I,"""I thank thee,"" answered Telemachus; ""Theoclymenus shall go with me;"
4865,I,"but as to the treasure, do thou keep it for me until these evil days"
4866,I,"are passed. If aught untoward befall me, I had rather it remained with"
4867,I,"thee than that it should fall into the hands of the wooers."""
4868,I,
4869,I,"Having taken leave of his friends, he returned to the house, taking"
4870,I,Theoclymenus with him. And when they had bathed and put on fresh
4871,I,"raiment, they sat down to meat. The meal proceeded in silence, and at"
4872,I,"last Penelope, who was sitting near, busy with her distaff, and"
4873,I,"longing impatiently to hear her son's news, said in a tone of"
4874,I,"displeasure: ""Hast thou no word for thy mother, Telemachus? Or art"
4875,I,thou keeping thy tidings until the wooers return? Surely I thought in
4876,I,this rare interval of quiet to hear how thou hast fared and what thou
4877,I,"hast learnt on this journey. But if thou hast naught to tell me, I"
4878,I,"will go to my widowed bed, and weep away the hours until dawn."""
4879,I,
4880,I,"Roused from his reverie by his mother's reproaches, Telemachus gave a"
4881,I,"brief account of his visit to Nestor and Menelaus, and of what they"
4882,I,"had told him. Penelope was musing on her son's report, when"
4883,I,"Theoclymenus, the second-sighted man, started up from his seat, and"
4884,I,"cried: ""I see him, I see him! He is landed in Ithaca, he is coming"
4885,I,"hither, he is here! Woe unto the suitors! Their hour is at hand, and"
4886,I,"not one of them shall escape."""
4887,I,
4888,I,Penelope had heard such prophecies too often to pay much heed to the
4889,I,"seer's vision. ""Ah! my friend,"" she said, with a sad smile, ""I can but"
4890,I,"pray that thy words will be fulfilled; if ever they are, it shall be a"
4891,I,"happy day for thee."""
4892,I,
4893,I,"At this moment the wooers came trooping in, filling the house with"
4894,I,riot and uproar; and there was an end of all quiet converse for that
4895,I,day.
4896,I,
4897,II,II
4898,II,
4899,II,It was past noon before Odysseus and Eumæus set out for the town; for
4900,II,"Eumæus had conceived a great liking for his guest, and listened with"
4901,II,"delight to his wonderful tales of adventure. ""Come,"" he said at last,"
4902,II,"when Odysseus had finished one of his long stories. ""It is time to be"
4903,II,"going, though I would willingly have kept thee here. But my young lord"
4904,II,"has spoken and we must obey."" ""Lead on,"" said Odysseus, ""I know what"
4905,II,"thou wouldst say; but first give me a staff to lean on, for I heard"
4906,II,"thee say that the path was rough."""
4907,II,
4908,II,"So saying he threw his tattered wallet over his shoulder, and taking a"
4909,II,"stout staff, which Eumæus offered him, started with his friend across"
4910,II,the hills. After a toilsome walk they reached the top of the hill
4911,II,"which overlooked the town, and descending the slope they came to a"
4912,II,"copious spring of water, well fenced with stones, and shaded by a"
4913,II,grove of alders. The water descended into a basin from the face of a
4914,II,rock in a cool and copious stream; and on either side stood an altar
4915,II,"to the nymphs. ""It is the common fountain of the townspeople,"""
4916,II,"explained Eumæus. ""The altars and the basin which receives the water"
4917,II,"are the work of our ancient kings."""
4918,II,
4919,II,"Odysseus paused a moment, lost in the memories which were awakened by"
4920,II,that familiar scene. But his reverie was rudely interrupted. While he
4921,II,"stood gazing at the fountain, he heard a rude voice hailing them from"
4922,II,"the road, and looking round he saw a man leading a pair of fine goats"
4923,II,"towards the town. It was Melanthius, his own goatherd, who was"
4924,II,bringing the best of his flock to make savoury meat for the wooers.
4925,II,
4926,II,"""Here are two birds of a feather!"" shouted the fellow, in jeering"
4927,II,"tones--""that wretched swineherd, and a ravenous beggar. A fine guest"
4928,II,"thou art bringing to our young masters, and a fair welcome, without"
4929,II,"doubt, they will give him. Were it not better that I took him with me"
4930,II,"to my farm? He could sweep out the pens, and gather green shoots for"
4931,II,"the kids; and we would give him whey to drink, and put some flesh on"
4932,II,these shrunk shanks[1] of his. But the lazy knave will do no work; he
4933,II,"would rather rub his shoulders against every door-post, begging for"
4934,II,"broken meat. Broken bones will be his portion, if the wooers see him"
4935,II,"near the house of Odysseus."""
4936,II,
4937,II,"[Footnote 1: ""A world too wide for his shrunk shanks,""--Shakespeare:"
4938,II,"""As You Like It.""]"
4939,II,
4940,II,While he uttered these taunts Melanthius had gradually come close to
4941,II,"Odysseus, and with the last word he lifted up his foot and kicked him"
4942,II,"with all his force on the hip. Odysseus stood like a rock, and stirred"
4943,II,not an inch from his ground; his first impulse was to seize the
4944,II,"ruffian by the ankles, and dash out his brains on the road; but he"
4945,II,"checked himself with a great effort, and said not a word."
4946,II,
4947,II,"But Eumæus rebuked the goatherd, and invoked the vengeance of heaven"
4948,II,"against him. ""Would that our noble master were here!"" he cried, ""he"
4949,II,"would soon make an end of thee, thou braggart! Unfaithful herdsman,"
4950,II,"that rovest ever about the town, leaving thy flock to underlings!"""
4951,II,
4952,II,"""Go to, thou dog!"" retorted Melanthius, with a savage laugh. ""Wilt"
4953,II,thou be ever harping on that string? Thy noble master is dust long
4954,II,"ago, and I would that Telemachus were lying with him. As for thee, I"
4955,II,"will one day cast thee bound into a ship, and sell thee across the"
4956,II,"seas for a great price."""
4957,II,
4958,II,"With that he left them, and stepped briskly out towards the house,"
4959,II,while Odysseus and Eumæus followed more slowly. Presently they came to
4960,II,"an extensive enclosure, standing conspicuously on a high level plateau"
4961,II,overlooking the town. Behind the fence towered the roof of a great
4962,II,"timber house. They passed through the outer gates, and as they entered"
4963,II,"the courtyard they heard the sounds of a harp, and the steam of roast"
4964,II,flesh was borne to their nostrils.
4965,II,
4966,II,"""Take heed now,"" said Eumæus, lowering his voice, as they approached"
4967,II,"the door of the house. ""I will go in first, and do thou follow me"
4968,II,"close, lest anyone find thee outside and do thee some hurt."""
4969,II,
4970,II,"""Fear nothing for me,"" answered Odysseus, ""I am no stranger to blows,"
4971,II,for I have been sore buffeted on land and sea. The belly is a stern
4972,II,"taskmaster, which compels us to face both wounds and death."""
4973,II,
4974,II,"So saying he stepped aside to let Eumæus pass, then checked him with a"
4975,II,hasty exclamation; for he had seen something which sent a pang of
4976,II,sorrow to his heart. Heaped up against the wall by the doorway was a
4977,II,"great pile of refuse, left there until the thralls should carry it"
4978,II,"away and lay it on the fields; and there, grievously neglected, and"
4979,II,"almost blind with age, lay a great gaunt hound, to all seeming more"
4980,II,dead than alive. What was the emotion of Odysseus when he recognised
4981,II,"in that poor creature his old favourite, Argus, whom he had reared"
4982,II,"with his own hand, and trained to the chase, in the old days before he"
4983,II,sailed to Troy! As he stooped down with a caressing gesture the hound
4984,II,"feebly raised his head; a strange light came into his eyes, he drooped"
4985,II,"his ears, and wagged his tail, but was too weak to stir from the place"
4986,II,"where he lay. Odysseus brushed away a tear, and said to Eumæus: ""'Tis"
4987,II,strange that so fine a hound should lie thus uncared for in his old
4988,II,"age. Or do his looks belie his qualities? Handsome he must have been,"
4989,II,as I can see still; but perhaps his beauty was all he had to boast
4990,II,"of."""
4991,II,
4992,II,"""He was my master's favourite hound,"" answered Eumæus, ""and there was"
4993,II,none swifter or keener of scent in all the land. Formerly the young
4994,II,men would take him with them to hunt the wild goat or the hare or the
4995,II,deer; but now that he is sore stricken with years not one of the women
4996,II,"will bring him a morsel to eat, or a little water to drink. So it ever"
4997,II,is when the master is absent; for a slave has no conscience when his
4998,II,"owner's eye is not upon him."""
4999,II,
5000,II,"When Eumæus had entered the house, Odysseus lingered awhile, gazing"
5001,II,"sadly at the faithful Argus. The old hound raised himself, and"
5002,II,struggled painfully to drag himself to his master's feet; but the
5003,II,"effort was too much for him, and he sank back on his sorry bed, and"
5004,II,breathed his last.
5005,II,
5006,II,"With a heavy heart Odysseus turned away, and passing into the hall sat"
5007,II,down on the threshold and laid his scrip beside him. Telemachus was
5008,II,"the first to notice him, and calling the swineherd, who was sitting"
5009,II,"near, he gave him a loaf of bread and a good handful of meat, and bade"
5010,II,"him carry it to the beggar. ""And tell him to go round and beg of all"
5011,II,"the wooers,"" he said: ""want and modesty agree ill together."" Eumæus"
5012,II,"brought the gift and the message, which Odysseus received with a"
5013,II,blessing on the giver. And when he had eaten he rose and went round
5014,II,"the hall, begging of the wooers. All gave him something until he came"
5015,II,"to Antinous, who stared at him insolently and asked who he was."
5016,II,
5017,II,"""I saw the fellow,"" answered Melanthius, ""a little while ago. Eumæus"
5018,II,"brought him hither, but who he is I know not."""
5019,II,
5020,II,"""Ah! thou rogue,"" said Antinous to the swineherd, ""we know thy ways!"
5021,II,Why didst thou bring this caitiff to the town? Are there not beggars
5022,II,enough here already to mar our pleasure when we sit down to meat? 'Tis
5023,II,"nought to thee, it seems, that these palmer-worms come swarming round"
5024,II,"the house to devour thy master's living."""
5025,II,
5026,II,[Illustration: The Return of Odysseus]
5027,II,
5028,II,"""He is no guest of my inviting,"" answered Eumæus. ""I would not invite"
5029,II,"to this house any wandering stranger, unless he were a prophet, or"
5030,II,"leech, or shipwright, or minstrel; and he is none of these. But thou"
5031,II,"art ever hard on the servants of Odysseus, and especially on me; yet I"
5032,II,"care not, so long as I satisfy Penelope and my young lord,"
5033,II,"Telemachus."""
5034,II,
5035,II,"""Eumæus, thou art overbold of speech,"" said Telemachus; then turning"
5036,II,"to Antinous he added: ""I thank thee for thy fatherly care, but we are"
5037,II,not so poor that we need to drive the stranger from our doors--heaven
5038,II,forbid! Give him something; 'tis I that bid thee: but thou art ever
5039,II,"better at taking than at giving."""
5040,II,
5041,II,"""I will give him something, thou malapert boy,"" answered Antinous,"
5042,II,"grinding his teeth with rage, ""something which will keep him from the"
5043,II,"house for three months to come."" As he spoke he thrust forward a heavy"
5044,II,"footstool from under the table, and placed it ready at hand."
5045,II,
5046,II,"Meanwhile, Odysseus, having filled his wallet, was preparing to return"
5047,II,"to his place on the threshold. But first he came to Antinous, and"
5048,II,addressed to him a long harangue in the common style of the
5049,II,"professional beggar, who had seen better days and been brought to want"
5050,II,by the malice of fortune. He concluded with a fragment of the story
5051,II,which he had already told to Eumæus.
5052,II,
5053,II,"Antinous heard him to the end with ill-disguised impatience, and then"
5054,II,"broke out in angry tones: ""Who brought this wretched fellow here to"
5055,II,"vex us? Stand off from my table, thou shameless varlet! Egypt, sayest"
5056,II,"thou? I will send thee to Egypt, and with a vengeance, too! It is a"
5057,II,"shame to see how they have squandered good meat on a dog like thee"";"
5058,II,"and he pointed to the wallet, now filled with the cheap bounty of the"
5059,II,wooers.
5060,II,
5061,II,"Odysseus drew back and made for the door, saying as he went: ""Of a"
5062,II,"truth, I wonder to find so princely a presence wedded to so mean a"
5063,II,"temper."""
5064,II,
5065,II,"When he heard that Antinous began to curse and to swear, and lifting"
5066,II,the footstool he hurled it with all his force at the retreating figure
5067,II,"of Odysseus. It struck him on the shoulder, with a crash that vibrated"
5068,II,"through the hall; but Odysseus heeded it not, but passed on without a"
5069,II,pause or a stumble to his place on the threshold. When he was seated
5070,II,"he complained loudly of the brutal conduct of Antinous. ""Accursed be"
5071,II,"he,"" he said, ""who lifts up his hand against a helpless beggar; may"
5072,II,"Heaven requite him for this foul deed!"""
5073,II,
5074,II,"""Thou hadst best be quiet,"" said Antinous, ""or we will drag thee by"
5075,II,"the heels through the hall, until we have stripped the flesh off thy"
5076,II,"bones."""
5077,II,
5078,II,"But this was too much even for the wooers. ""Antinous,"" said one of"
5079,II,"them, ""it was ill done of thee to strike the hapless wanderer. Take"
5080,II,"heed that thou bring not a curse upon thyself, if there be gods in"
5081,II,heaven to see such deeds. And what if a god should visit this house in
5082,II,"some strange disguise, to make trial of our hearts? It were no new"
5083,II,"thing."""
5084,II,
5085,II,A chill seemed to have fallen on the company after this shameful
5086,II,"incident. The wooers had ceased their clamour, and sat talking in low"
5087,II,"tones together; Odysseus and Telemachus sat silent in their places,"
5088,II,"brooding gloomily on the outrage; Antinous alone remained unmoved,"
5089,II,"being hardened, within and without, against all reproach."
5090,II,
5091,II,"When Penelope, who was sitting among her maidens in her chamber, heard"

5098,II,"somewhat to tell me of Odysseus, my lord?"" Eumæus was summoned, and"
5099,II,"having heard the desire of Penelope, he answered: ""My queen, there is"
5100,II,a rare pleasure awaiting thee. This man hath a tongue to charm thy
5101,II,"very soul. Three days and nights he abode with me, and all that time"
5102,II,he kept us spellbound by the tale of his adventures. It was as if we
5103,II,"were listening to the lay of some rare minstrel, a god-gifted man, who"
5104,II,sways all hearts as he will by the magic of his voice. And he brings

5110,II,
5111,II,"As she spoke, a loud sneeze was heard in the room below. ""It was my"

5118,II,left his place by the door and passed through them again. The truth
5119,II,was that Odysseus feared recognition if he appeared before his wife in
5120,II,broad daylight; so he affected to complain of the indifference of
5121,II,"Telemachus, who had allowed the savage deed of Antinous to go"
5122,II,"unpunished, and begged permission to wait until the evening, when the"
5123,II,"wooers would be gone home, and he could tell his story unmolested."

5141,II,
5142,II,
5143,II,"Just after Eumæus had left, a huge, ungainly fellow came slouching up"
5144,II,"to the place where Odysseus was sitting, and eyed him with a look of"
5145,II,"great disfavour. He was the town beggar, known far and wide in Ithaca"
5146,II,as the greediest and laziest knave in the whole island. His real name
5147,II,"was Arnæus, but from being employed to run errands about the place he"
5148,II,had received the nickname of Irus. Highly indignant at finding his
5149,II,"rights usurped by a new-comer, and thinking to find in that battered"
5150,II,"old man an easy victim, he began to rate his supposed rival in a big,"
5151,II,"blustering voice: ""Give place, old man, to thy betters, and force me"
5152,II,"not to use my hands upon thee. Begone, and that quickly, or it shall"
5153,II,"be the worse for thee; out of the way, I say!"""
5154,II,

5157,II,"perceive, a beggar like me, and I grudge thee not anything which thou"
5158,II,mayest receive in the way of alms from those who sit here. There is
5159,II,room on this threshold for us both. But I warn thee not to provoke me
5160,II,"to blows, for old as I am I will set a mark upon thee which thou wilt"

5162,II,
5163,II,"Trusting in his size, and encouraged by the nods and winks of the"
5164,II,"wooers who sat near, Irus was only too ready to take up the challenge."
5165,II,"""Hark to the old starveling cur!"" he shouted. ""How glib of tongue he"
5166,II,"is, like any scolding hag! Get thee to thy fists then, since thou wilt"
5167,II,"have it so, and I will knock all thy teeth out, if thou hast any"
5168,II,"left""; and he thrust Odysseus with his foot."
5169,II,
5170,II,"All the wooers now came running up, and crowded round the exasperated"
5171,II,"beggars, hoping to see fine sport. Antinous took the lead, such a"
5172,II,"scene being exactly to his taste. ""Here is matter for mirth,"" he"
5173,II,"cried, laughing, ""for many a day. Make a ring quickly, and let them"

5185,II,"blow while he was fighting with Irus. To this they all agreed, and"
5186,II,"forthwith Odysseus stripped to the waist, and girded his rags about"

5211,II,"and Odysseus, seizing the prostrate beggar by the foot, dragged him"

5281,I,"she seemed so wondrous fair. Turning to Telemachus she said: ""My son,"
5282,I,with grief I perceive that thy understanding increaseth not with thy
5283,I,"growth, but rather becometh less. Who would think, seeing thee thus"
5284,I,"tall and comely, like a prince's true son, that thou wouldst suffer"
5285,I,such deeds to be wrought upon the stranger within thy gates? What if
5286,I,he had come by his death through this violence? What shame and infamy
5287,I,"to thee!"""
5288,I,
5289,I,"""Mother,"" answered Telemachus, ""thou hast some reason for thine anger."
5290,I,"Howbeit, I have a man's wit, and am not, as thou sayest, more foolish"
5291,I,than a child. But what can one do against so many? And as to this
5292,I,"stranger, thou wouldst know that thy fears are idle, if thou couldst"
5293,I,"see Irus as he now sits at the gate, rolling his head like a drunkard,"
5294,I,with no strength to stand on his feet or stir from his place. Would
5295,I,"that all the wooers were in the same plight!"""
5296,I,
5297,I,"While Telemachus was defending himself, Eurymachus had been gazing"
5298,I,with bold eyes on that fair lady; and now he addressed her with smooth
5299,I,"words of flattery: ""Daughter of Icarius, sage Penelope, if all the"
5300,I,"Greeks could behold thee as now thou art, this house would not contain"
5301,I,the multitude of thy wooers. Thou surpassest all the daughters of men
5302,I,"in beauty, and in stature, and in thy even-balanced wit"""
5303,I,
5304,I,"""Eurymachus,"" answered Penelope, ""all the bloom of my womanhood was"
5305,I,"blighted on the evil day when the Greeks embarked for Troy, and"
5306,I,"Odysseus, my lord, went with them. But now I am like some poor hunted"
5307,I,"creature, hard beset by the hounds of fate. Well I remember my"
5308,I,"husband's parting words. Holding my right hand he said: 'Dear wife, I"
5309,I,"am going into the midst of perils, and it may be that we shall never"
5310,I,"see each other again. Be thou but faithful to thy trust, and remember"
5311,I,whose daughter thou art; and when thou seest thy son with a beard on
5312,I,"his cheeks, thou art free to marry whom thou wilt.' Such were his"
5313,I,"words, and now they shall shortly be fulfilled. I see the day"
5314,I,approaching which shall make me another man's wife; better for me if I
5315,I,were the bride of death! For who ever beheld such wooing as yours?
5316,I,'Twas ever the custom among those who sought the daughter of a wealthy
5317,I,house in marriage to bring with them their own sheep and oxen to make
5318,I,good cheer for the friends of the bride; but ye sit here as unbidden
5319,I,"guests, and devour my living."""
5320,I,
5321,I,Odysseus smiled to himself with pleasure when he heard this artful
5322,I,"speech of Penelope, for he perceived her intention, which was to draw"
5323,I,"gifts from the wooers, and raise their hopes by the prospect of her"
5324,I,"approaching marriage. And the artifice was successful, for the wooers,"
5325,I,"following the lead of Antinous and Eurymachus, at once despatched"
5326,I,their servants to bring the bride gifts from their houses. Antinous
5327,I,"gave a splendid embroidered robe, with twelve golden clasps,"
5328,I,"Eurymachus a necklace of amber and gold, and Eurydamas a pair of"
5329,I,jewelled earrings. These and other costly offerings were brought to
5330,I,Penelope in her chamber.
5331,I,
5332,II,II
5333,II,
5334,II,"When evening came on, the wooers ordered three braziers to be set up"
5335,II,"in the hall, to give them light as they sat at their pastimes. The"
5336,II,"braziers were fed with dry chips of pine-wood, and the maid-servants"
5337,II,relieved each other from time to time in the duty of keeping up the
5338,II,"fires. Presently Odysseus drew near to the handmaids, and said: ""Go ye"
5339,II,"and attend the queen in her chamber, I will serve the fires, and give"
5340,II,"light to the company. Yea, though they sit here all night they shall"
5341,II,"not tire me out, for I am a much-enduring man."""
5342,II,
5343,II,"The women laughed, and glanced at one another; and one of them, whose"
5344,II,"name was Melantho, spoke bitterly to Odysseus, and reviled him,"
5345,II,"saying: ""Thou wretched old man, why goest thou not to find a bed in"
5346,II,"the smithy, or wherever else thou canst, instead of loitering here,"
5347,II,"and vexing us with thy prate? Either thou hast drunk a cup too much,"
5348,II,"or else thou art stricken in thy wits. Get thee gone, lest a stronger"
5349,II,"than Irus lay his hand upon thee and break thy bones."""
5350,II,
5351,II,"""Now will I go straightway to Telemachus,"" answered Odysseus fiercely,"
5352,II,"""yonder where he sits, and tell him what thou sayest, thou vixen, that"
5353,II,"he may hew thee in pieces on the spot."""
5354,II,
5355,II,So menacing were his looks and his tones that the women fled quaking
5356,II,from the hall and left him to tend the fires. So there he stood in
5357,II,"view of the whole company, to their eyes a poor outcast, intent on his"
5358,II,menial task; but thoughts other than of the fires filled his heart.
5359,II,
5360,II,As he stooped over one of the braziers and stirred the fuel into a
5361,II,"blaze, Eurymachus noticed the red gleam which was reflected from the"
5362,II,"smooth, bald crown of the supposed beggar. ""Look!"" he cried, laughing"
5363,II,"and pointing at Odysseus, ""surely this man is a favourite of heaven;"
5364,II,for see how the light shines like a crown of glory on his hairless
5365,II,"pate!"""
5366,II,
5367,II,"Then he called to Odysseus, and said: ""How sayest thou, friend, wilt"
5368,II,"thou be my thrall, and work on my farm among the hills for a fixed"
5369,II,wage? Thy business would be to repair the stone fences and work on the
5370,II,"plantation; thou wouldst have a whole coat to thy back, and shoes to"
5371,II,"thy feet, and thy penny fee, and bread to eat all the year round. But"
5372,II,I can read thine answer in thy face: thou wouldst rather crouch and
5373,II,"whine for bread than do aught useful to earn thy living."""
5374,II,
5375,II,"""Eurymachus,"" answered Odysseus firmly, ""I would that I could prove my"
5376,II,manhood against thine in any trial of strength and endurance. Let it
5377,II,"be a match of mowing, in a rich meadow-land, on the longest day in"
5378,II,"spring, and let us ply the scythe together, fasting, from dawn till"
5379,II,"eve. Or give me a stout pair of oxen, mighty beasts, equal in"
5380,II,"strength, and both well filled with fodder, and set me to plough a"
5381,II,"field of four acres, of rich, deep soil--then wouldst thou see if I"
5382,II,could drive a straight furrow. Or stand by my side on the perilous
5383,II,"edge of battle, with equal arms, and try whether I would flinch sooner"
5384,II,"than thou. A great man and a mighty thou seemest to thyself, having"
5385,II,"never learnt what true manhood is. Poor windy braggart, if Odysseus"
5386,II,"set foot in this house again, the doors would seem too narrow to thee"
5387,II,"in thy haste to escape."""
5388,II,
5389,II,"""Thou saucy knave!"" cried Eurymachus, incensed by this daring speech,"
5390,II,"""I will teach thee respect for thy betters""; and seizing a footstool"
5391,II,he prepared to hurl it at the offender's head. But Odysseus sprang
5392,II,aside and ran to Amphinomus for protection; the heavy missile flew
5393,II,"hurtling through the air, and struck one of the servants, who was just"
5394,II,"crossing the room, on the arm. Down went the man with a cry of pain,"
5395,II,"and the wooers raised an uproar throughout the hall. ""A murrain on"
5396,II,"this begging loon!"" exclaimed one. ""Why came he hither to bring strife"
5397,II,"among us?"""
5398,II,
5399,II,"""Ye are mad, my masters!"" said Telemachus, raising his voice; ""verily"
5400,II,ye are flown with insolence and wine.[1] Ye had better go home and
5401,II,"sleep off your liquor before worse comes of it."""
5402,II,
5403,II,"[Footnote 1: Milton, ""Paradise Lost,"" i. 502.]"
5404,II,
5405,II,"The wooers were indeed in a dangerous mood, and they began to finger"
5406,II,"their weapons, and utter fierce threats against Telemachus. But"
5407,II,"Amphinomus interposed, and by exerting all his influence induced them"
5408,II,to forgo their murderous purpose and disperse quietly to their homes.
5409,II,
5410,II,
5411,II,
5412,II,
5413,II,Odysseus and Penelope
5414,II,
5415,II,
5416,II,"As soon as the house was quiet, Telemachus, obeying a sign from his"
5417,II,"father, prepared to convey the weapons which hung about the hall to an"
5418,II,"inner chamber, out of the reach of the wooers. First he ordered"
5419,II,"Eurycleia to keep the women out of the way, and having barred the"
5420,II,"doors leading to the inner apartments, he took down helmet and spear"
5421,II,"and shield from the walls, and carried them, with his father's help,"
5422,II,to the upper room. When this important task was performed he withdrew
5423,II,"for the night, and Odysseus was left alone in the hall to await the"
5424,II,coming of Penelope.
5425,II,
5426,II,"Presently the doors were opened, and by the flickering light of the"
5427,II,"braziers Odysseus, for the first time after twenty years, saw the face"
5428,II,"of his wife. Lovely indeed she seemed in his eyes, not less than when"
5429,II,he wedded her in her maiden bloom. Her handmaids brought a chair of
5430,II,"silver and ivory, a work of most rare device, and set it by the fire"
5431,II,with a soft fleece upon it. Penelope took the seat prepared for her
5432,II,"and gazed curiously at the stranger, who sat crouched in the shadow of"
5433,II,"a pillar, avoiding her eye. Meanwhile the women were bustling about"
5434,II,"the hall, removing the remains of the feast, and heaping fresh fuel on"
5435,II,"the fires. Among them was Melantho, who had spoken so roughly to"
5436,II,Odysseus an hour or two before. When she saw Odysseus she began
5437,II,"railing at him again, and rudely bade him begone. Penelope soon"
5438,II,"reduced her to silence, and then calling Eurycleia she bade her place"
5439,II,a seat for the stranger.
5440,II,
5441,II,"""Now tell me,"" began Penelope, when the chair had been brought, ""who"
5442,II,"art thou, and of what country? And who were thy father and mother?"""
5443,II,
5444,II,"""Ah! lady,"" answered Odysseus, ""I beseech thee, question me not as to"
5445,II,"my country and my friends, lest thou open anew the fountain of my"
5446,II,grief. It is not seemly to sit weeping and wailing in a stranger's
5447,II,house; and I fear that thou wilt say that my tears are the tears of
5448,II,"drunkenness."""
5449,II,
5450,II,"Penelope pressed him for an answer. ""Thou surely art of some country,"""
5451,II,"she said, smiling; ""or art thou one of those of whom old stories tell,"
5452,II,"born of stocks and stones?"""
5453,II,
5454,II,"""Since thou urgest it so strongly,"" replied Odysseus, ""I cannot deny"
5455,II,"thee. In the broad realm of Crete there is a certain city, Cnosus by"
5456,II,"name; there reigned Minos, and begat Deucalion, my famous sire. To"
5457,II,"Deucalion two sons were born, Idomeneus the elder, and myself, whom he"
5458,II,"named Æthon. When war arose between the Greeks and Trojans, Idomeneus"
5459,II,"sailed to fight for the sons of Atreus, and I was left behind in my"
5460,II,"father's house. Then it was that I saw Odysseus, who was driven by"
5461,II,stress of weather to seek shelter on our coasts. When he had anchored
5462,II,"his ships in the harbour, he came up to the town and inquired for"
5463,II,"Idomeneus, whom he said was his friend, honoured and beloved; but we"
5464,II,told him that Idomeneus had departed ten days before. Then I received
5465,II,"him in my house, and feasted him and all his company for twelve days;"
5466,II,"for all that time the north wind blew, so that a man could not stand"
5467,II,up against it. On the thirteenth day the wind ceased and they put out
5468,II,"to sea."""
5469,II,
5470,II,"Penelope's tears flowed fast as she listened to that cunning fiction,"
5471,II,which seemed to bring her husband before her eyes. Odysseus watched
5472,II,"her, with eyes set like horn or iron, as she sat before him sobbing"
5473,II,"and rocking herself to and fro; but his heart grew big within him, and"
5474,II,"he could hardly keep back his own tears. At length she grew calmer,"
5475,II,"and wishing to try him, asked him this searching question: ""If thou"
5476,II,"didst indeed entertain my husband in thy house, tell me what manner of"
5477,II,"man he was, and what garments he had on, and who they were that"
5478,II,"attended him."""
5479,II,
5480,II,"""It is hard,"" answered Odysseus, ""to tell thee of what thou askest,"
5481,II,after twenty years; nevertheless I will attempt to call up his image
5482,II,"from the past. He wore a purple woollen cloak, of two folds, and it"
5483,II,was held by a golden brooch with a double clasp; and on the brooch was
5484,II,"fashioned a hound, holding in his jaws a fawn; and so skilfully was it"
5485,II,"wrought that the figures seemed to live, the fawn struggling to"
5486,II,"escape, and the hound clenching his fangs to hold him--so rare a piece"
5487,II,"it was. Under his cloak, Odysseus wore a close-fitting tunic, which"
5488,II,glistened like the peel of a dried onion; for very soft and fine was
5489,II,the texture. I cannot tell whether these were the garments which he
5490,II,had on when he left you; it may be that they were a gift received on
5491,II,"his voyage, for he had many friends. Even so I gave him a sword of"
5492,II,"bronze and a mantle, and a fringed tunic, when I bade him adieu."
5493,II,"Further, I would have thee know that he had a squire with him,"
5494,II,"somewhat older than himself, a round-shouldered man, dark of"
5495,II,"complexion, and with curling hair. His name was Eurybates, and"
5496,II,"Odysseus held him in high regard."""
5497,II,
5498,II,"What were the emotions of Penelope, when she heard the raiment and"
5499,II,ornaments which her husband was wearing the last time she saw him thus
5500,II,described down to the minutest detail! For a long time she remained
5501,II,"silent, overpowered by her feelings; and when she spoke again there"
5502,II,"was a ring of sincere warmth and friendliness in her voice. ""I pitied"
5503,II,"thee before,"" she said, ""seeing thee thus forlorn, but now thou shalt"
5504,II,"be my dear and honoured guest, for I know that thou hast spoken the"
5505,II,"truth. These garments, and the golden brooch, were a gift from my own"
5506,II,hands to my dear lord. Alas! I shall never see him again. Cursed be
5507,II,"the day that parted me from him, and sent him to the land of Troy,"
5508,II,"that name abhorred of my soul!"""
5509,II,
5510,II,"""Lady,"" answered Odysseus, ""no one could blame thee, or say that thou"
5511,II,"sorrowest beyond measure, for such a husband as thine. He was indeed a"
5512,II,man of rare and god-like gifts. Nevertheless be comforted; for ere
5513,II,"many days are passed thou wilt see him here, safe and sound, and"
5514,II,"loaded with the wealth which he has gathered in his wanderings."" Then"
5515,II,"he went on to repeat the story which he had already told to Eumæus,"
5516,II,"with some further facts, drawn from his own experience in the last ten"
5517,II,"years; and concluded with this solemn adjuration: ""Witness, this"
5518,II,"hearth of Odysseus, to which I am come, and witness Zeus, the supreme"
5519,II,"lord of heaven, if I lie! Ere yonder moon hath waned, Odysseus will be"
5520,II,"sitting under this roof."""
5521,II,
5522,II,"Penelope shook her head sadly, as she replied: ""It will be a happy day"
5523,II,"for thee, if thy prophecy is confirmed by the event. But what am I"
5524,II,"saying? 'Tis an empty dream. But come, let the maidens prepare a bath"
5525,II,"for thee, and afterwards them shalt sleep sound in a soft, warm bed."
5526,II,"Well hast thou deserved to receive all honour and worship at my hands,"
5527,II,and woe unto him that shall seek to harm thee! I will put a speedy end
5528,II,"to his wooing. For what wilt thou say of me, when thou art wandering"
5529,II,"in distant lands, if I suffer thee to abide here thus poorly clad,"
5530,II,"unwashed, and uncared for? Few and evil are the days of our life; and"
5531,II,the best we can do is to win a good name by our gentle deeds while we
5532,II,"live, and leave a fair memory behind us when we die."""
5533,II,
5534,II,"""I doubt not thy goodness,"" replied Odysseus; ""but I have long been a"
5535,II,"stranger to the comforts of which thou speakest, and they suit not my"
5536,II,forlorn and desolate state. Nor would I that any of thy handmaids
5537,II,"should wash my feet, and mock my infirmities; but if thou hast here an"
5538,II,"aged house-dame, like unto me in years and in sorrows, I grudge not"
5539,II,"that such a one should wait upon me."""
5540,II,
5541,II,"""Thou speakest as a prudent man,"" said Penelope, ""and I have such an"
5542,II,aged dame as thou describest among my household. She was the first who
5543,II,"took my ill-fated husband in her arms when his mother bare him, and"
5544,II,"she nursed him tenderly and well. She shall wash thy feet, old though"
5545,II,"she be, and feeble."" Then she called Eurycleia, who was sitting near,"
5546,II,"and said to her: ""Come hither, nurse, and wash the stranger's feet."
5547,II,"Who knows but thy master is now in like evil case, grown old before"
5548,II,"his time through care and misery?"""
5549,II,
5550,II,"When she heard that, the old woman lifted up her voice and wept:"
5551,II,"""Odysseus,"" she cried, ""child of my sorrow, what have I not borne for"
5552,II,"thee! Pious thou wast, and righteous in all thy dealings, yet Zeus"
5553,II,hath chosen thee out from among all men to be the object of his hate.
5554,II,"Yea, and perchance even now he is mocked in the house of strangers, as"
5555,II,"these women were lately mocking thee. Yea, I will wash thee, as"
5556,II,"Penelope bids me, and for thy sake also, for my heart is moved with"
5557,II,"pity because of thy woes."""
5558,II,
5559,II,"With such speed as her years allowed, the dame went and fetched warm"
5560,II,"water, and a vessel for washing the feet. She set them down in front"
5561,II,"of Odysseus, and before she began her task, stood for some time"
5562,II,"peering curiously into his face. ""Hear me, friend,"" she said, after a"
5563,II,"while, ""of all the strangers that ever entered these doors, ne'er saw"
5564,II,"I one so like unto Odysseus as thou art, in form, and in voice, and in"
5565,II,"feet."""
5566,II,
5567,II,"""So said everyone who saw us together,"" answered Odysseus. But her"
5568,II,"words filled him with alarm, and recalled to his mind an old scar,"
5569,II,"just above the knee, caused by a wound which he had received from a"
5570,II,"wild boar while hunting in his boyhood in the valleys of Parnassus,"
5571,II,"during a visit to Autolycus, Penelope's father. If his old nurse"
5572,II,"should discover the scar she would be certain to recognise him, and"
5573,II,"the consequences of the premature discovery might be fatal. However,"
5574,II,"he had now no excuse for declining the bath, so he drew back his chair"
5575,II,"into the shadow, still hoping to escape detection."
5576,II,
5577,II,"But Eurycleia, whose suspicions were already aroused, was not thus to"
5578,II,be evaded. As she handled the limb her fingers felt the well-known
5579,II,"mark, and she let the foot fall with a loud cry. The vessel was"
5580,II,"overset, and the water ran over the floor. Half laughing and half"
5581,II,"weeping, the old woman fell upon his neck. ""Thou art Odysseus, dear"
5582,II,"child!"" she cried, ""and yet I knew thee not till I had touched thee"
5583,II,"with my hands."""

5585,II,[Illustration: Odysseus and Eurycleia]
5586,II,
5587,II,"During all this scene Penelope had been sitting like one in a dream,"
5588,II,lost in the memories awakened by the supposed beggar's story. The
5589,II,"nurse now turned to rouse her from her reverie, and tell her the"
5590,II,"joyful news; but Odysseus, seeing her intention, pressed a heavy hand"
5591,II,"on her mouth, and, drawing her down to him with the other, said in a"
5592,II,"fierce whisper: ""Peace, woman, or I will slay thee! Wouldst thou"

5594,II,
5595,II,Eurycleia had now recovered from the shock of that sudden recognition.
5596,II,"""Fear me not,"" she said, ""I will be as secret as the grave. But see,"
5597,II,"the water is all spilt; I go to fetch more."" And so with a grave face,"
5598,II,"but a heart bounding with delight, the faithful old creature brought a"
5599,II,"fresh supply of water, and proceeded with the task of washing her"
5600,II,master's feet.

5602,II,"When he resumed his place by the fire, he found Penelope in a soft and"

5605,II,"keep thee much longer from thy rest, for the hour approaches which"
5606,II,brings sweet oblivion to careworn hearts--all save mine. For the night

5627,II,"alighted on a jutting beam of the roof, and thus spake unto me with a"
5628,II,"human voice: 'Take comfort, daughter of Icarius; no dream is this, but"
5629,II,"a waking vision, which shall surely be fulfilled. The geese are the"
5630,II,"wooers, and I the eagle am thy husband, who will shortly come and give"
5631,II,"them to their doom.' Even as he said this I awoke, and going to the"
5632,II,"window I saw the geese by the door, cropping the grain from the"
5633,II,"trough, as is their wont."""
5634,II,
5635,II,"""Lady,"" answered Odysseus, ""there is but one interpretation of thy"
5636,II,"dream, and thy husband declared it with his own voice. Death looms"
5637,II,"near at hand for the wooers, and not one of them shall escape."""
5638,II,
5639,II,"But Penelope shook her head. ""It is ill trusting in dreams,"" she said,"
5640,II,"""and hard to discern the false from the true. There are two gates from"
5641,II,"which flitting dreams are sent to men: one is of horn, and the other"
5642,II,of ivory: and the dreams which pass through the ivory gate are sent to
5643,II,"beguile, while those which come from the gate of horn are a true"
5644,II,"message to him who sees them. And my dream, I believe, was sent me"
5645,II,"from the gate of ivory. Yea, the day is approaching, the hateful day,"
5646,II,which shall part me for ever from the house of Odysseus; and this
5647,II,shall be the manner of the trial whereby I will prove which of the
5648,II,"wooers is to win me: I will set up twelve axes, like the trestles on"
5649,II,"which the keel of a ship is laid, in the hall, and he who can send an"
5650,II,arrow through the line of double axeheads from the further end of the
5651,II,"hall shall win me for his bride. This device I learnt from Odysseus,"
5652,II,who was wont thus to prove his skill in archery. Then farewell my
5653,II,"home, the house of my lord, the home of my love, so fair, so full of"
5654,II,"plenty, which will haunt me in my dreams even unto life's end."""
5655,II,
5656,II,"""Tis well-imagined, this trial of the wooers,"" answered Odysseus, ""and"
5657,II,I counsel thee to put them to the proof without delay; for I am sure
5658,II,that Odysseus will return here again before ever one of these men
5659,II,"shall string his bow and shoot an arrow through the line of axes."""
5660,II,
5661,II,"""Well, my friend,"" said Penelope, ""I will now bid thee good-night,"
5662,II,"though gladly would I sit here till to-morrow's dawn, and let thee"
5663,II,"discourse to enchant mine ear. But there is a time for all things, and"
5664,II,I would not rob thee of thy needful rest. Therefore I will go and lay
5665,II,"my head on my uneasy pillow, and the women shall lay a bed for thee"
5666,II,"here, or where thou choosest."""
5667,II,
5668,II,
5669,II,
5670,II,
5671,II,The End draws near; Signs and Wonders
5672,II,
5673,II,
5674,II,"True to his character as a wandering beggar, Odysseus lay down to rest"
5675,II,on a pile of sheepskins in the portico of the house. His mind was full
5676,II,"of the events of the day, and of the terrible task which he had to"
5677,II,perform on the morrow. When he thought of all the insults which had
5678,II,"been heaped upon him in his own house, he ground his teeth with rage,"
5679,II,and muttered bitter curses against the wooers. As if on purpose to
5680,II,"provoke him further, just at this moment Melantho, and several of the"
5681,II,"other women, who slept in the town, came forth from the house, and"
5682,II,passed by him with shrill laughter and merry gibes. Then his heart
5683,II,"growled within him, even as a mother-hound growls over her whelps when"
5684,II,"she sees a stranger approaching, and in a sudden impulse of fury he"
5685,II,started up to slay those faithless women on the spot; but repressing
5686,II,his mad purpose he smote his breast and rebuked his fiery spirit. Had
5687,II,he not borne even worse than this on the day when the Cyclops devoured
5688,II,his comrades in the cave?
5689,II,
5690,II,"When anger and shame had had their turn, other and more pressing"
5691,II,"anxieties came crowding upon him, banishing sleep from his eyelids."
5692,II,How was he with such help as Telemachus could give him to overpower
5693,II,and slay a hundred men in the prime of their youth and strength? It
5694,II,"seemed an impossible feat, and his heart quaked within him as he"
5695,II,counted those fearful odds.
5696,II,
5697,II,"At last sleep came upon him unawares, and in a dream he saw his divine"
5698,II,"friend and helper, Athene, standing by him, robed in awful beauty."
5699,II,"""Where is thy faith?"" she asked, in sweet and solemn tones. ""Dost thou"
5700,II,"doubt my power to help thee? Know this, that with me at thy side thou"
5701,II,"couldst rout and slay a thousand armed men. Sleep on, then, and vex"
5702,II,"thyself no more; in a few short hours all thy trials shall be passed,"
5703,II,"and thou shalt rest in triumph under thine own roof-tree."" Then she"
5704,II,"touched his brow with her finger, and departed; and after that he"
5705,II,slept on soundly until dawn.
5706,II,
5707,II,"In the first grey light of morning he awoke, roused by a sound as of"
5708,II,one wailing within the house. He sat up in his bed and listened: it
5709,II,"was the voice of Penelope, his wife; for she too had had her dreams,"
5710,II,"sweet, indeed, while they lasted, but bitter to her waking memory. She"
5711,II,"thought that her husband came to her, in all the glory of his manhood,"
5712,II,"even as when he set out for Troy, and put his arms about her, and"
5713,II,"kissed her tenderly. Therefore she wept and wailed, thinking that it"
5714,II,"was another false vision, sent by some hostile deity to mock her"
5715,II,widowhood.
5716,II,
5717,II,What a sound was that for the lonely watcher before the house!
5718,II,"""Patience, fond, sad heart!"" he murmured to himself, ""this very night"
5719,II,"thou shalt hold me in thine arms, and sob out thy sorrows on my"
5720,II,"breast."" With that he rose to his feet, and lifting up his hands to"
5721,II,"heaven put up a prayer to Zeus: ""Dread sire of gods, if with good will"
5722,II,"ye have brought me thus far, after so many perils by land and by"
5723,II,"water, send me a sign from heaven, and reveal unto me your purpose by"
5724,II,"the lips of one of those that be within the house."""
5725,II,
5726,II,A loud peal of thunder was heard in answer to his prayer; and a second
5727,II,sign was sent by the voice of a woman in the house. She was one of
5728,II,"twelve maid-servants, whose duty it was to grind wheat and barley for"
5729,II,"the daily supply of bread. The others had finished their task, but"
5730,II,"she, being old and weak, was still toiling at her mill. When she heard"
5731,II,"the thunder she stopped for a moment, and thus uttered her complaint:"
5732,II,"""Thunder in a clear sky! That bodes ill to some that be here. Heaven"
5733,II,"grant that it may be to the wooers, for whom day by day I suffer this"
5734,II,"cruel toil, making meal for them! May this be the very last time that"
5735,II,"they sit down to meat in this house!"" So saying, she returned to her"
5736,II,"labour, and Odysseus rejoiced at the double sign which had been"
5737,II,vouchsafed to him.
5738,II,
5739,II,"By this time the whole household was afoot, and a score of busy hands"
5740,II,"were at work, under the direction of Eurycleia, preparing for the"
5741,II,"coming of the wooers. For it was a general holiday, being the festival"
5742,II,"of Apollo, and the guests were expected earlier than usual. Some went"
5743,II,"to the public fountain to fetch water, some swept and sprinkled the"
5744,II,"floor, and some sponged the tables and scoured the drinking vessels."
5745,II,"Presently the herdsmen came in, driving before them the beasts for"
5746,II,"sacrifice; and of these the first to arrive was Eumæus, who brought"
5747,II,three fat hogs as his part of the daily tribute. Leaving his charge to
5748,II,"grub about in the courtyard, he came up to Odysseus, and inquired how"
5749,II,"he had fared among the wooers on the previous day. ""I fared ill,"""
5750,II,"answered Odysseus, ""and ill fare the villains who deal thus with the"
5751,II,"stranger under another man's roof!"""
5752,II,
5753,II,"A rude voice here broke in upon him, and Melanthius the goatherd"
5754,II,"thrust himself between them, jostling Odysseus, and reviling him in"
5755,II,"brutal terms, ""What, still loitering here, thou vagabond? Wilt thou go"
5756,II,"begging at other men's tables, or art thou waiting to taste of my"
5757,II,"fists?"" Odysseus deigned no reply, but shook his head, biding his"
5758,II,time.
5759,II,
5760,II,"Another herdsman now entered the courtyard; this was Philoetius, who"
5761,II,had charge of the herds of Odysseus on the mainland. He brought a
5762,II,"heifer and two or three fat goats, having crossed over to Ithaca by"
5763,II,"the ferry. When he saw Odysseus he took Eumæus aside, and inquired who"
5764,II,"he was. ""He is of kingly aspect,"" remarked the new-comer, ""in spite of"
5765,II,"his wretched garb. But even kings may come to beggary, if it be"
5766,II,"Heaven's will."""
5767,II,
5768,II,"Having heard from Eumæus what he had to tell, Philoetius approached"
5769,II,"Odysseus, and taking his right hand greeted him kindly, saying:"
5770,II,"""Welcome, old friend, for my master's sake! E'en such, methinks, is"
5771,II,"his case, if he still lives and looks upon the daylight. Ah! what a"
5772,II,thought is that! It brings the sweat of agony to my brow when I think
5773,II,"that even now he may be wandering in rags from door to door, begging"
5774,II,"for a morsel of bread, while his flocks and herds roam in thousands on"
5775,II,the hills. What shall I do? It is not to be borne that all this wealth
5776,II,"should increase and multiply, to feed the mouths of thieves and"
5777,II,rogues. Often have I resolved to drive off my cattle into a far
5778,II,"country, and no longer to abet these men in their riotous living; but"
5779,II,"my duty to Telemachus, and the hope that even now my lord may return,"
5780,II,"still hold me back."""
5781,II,
5782,II,"Perceiving the neatherd to be loyal and staunch, Odysseus resolved to"
5783,II,"take him partly into his confidence, and answered accordingly: ""Thy"
5784,II,"hope is nearer to fulfilment than thou thinkest. Hear me swear, by the"
5785,II,"hearth of Odysseus, and by the board at which I have fed, that before"
5786,II,thou leavest Ithaca thou shalt see thy master with thine own
5787,II,"eyes--thou shalt see him slaying the wooers who play the master here."""
5788,II,
5789,II,"""Would that I might live to behold that day!"" cried Philoetius. ""May I"
5790,II,"never eat bread again, if the wooers felt not the might of my hands."""
5791,II,Eumæus also declared himself ready to risk all by the side of
5792,II,Odysseus.
5793,II,
5794,II,"While they were thus conversing, the whole body of the wooers came"
5795,II,"thronging into the house, and the daily banquet began. At the inner"
5796,II,"end of the hall, commanding the door which led to the women's"
5797,II,"quarters, was a sort of platform or dais of stone, raised to some"
5798,II,"height above the general level of the floor, and facing the main"
5799,II,"entrance. Here Telemachus, as giver of the feast, was seated; and"
5800,II,while the servants were handing round the dishes he called Odysseus
5801,II,"from his place by the door, and made him sit down by his side. ""Sit"
5802,II,"down here,"" he said, ""and eat and drink thy fill. And you, sirs,"" he"
5803,II,"added, addressing the wooers, ""keep a guard on your hands and your"
5804,II,"tongues. This is no tavern, but my own house, and I will not suffer my"
5805,II,"guest to be wronged by word or deed under my roof."""
5806,II,
5807,II,"This bold speech passed for the present unchallenged, though many a"
5808,II,threatening look was directed at the young prince. By order of
5809,II,"Telemachus, Odysseus received an equal portion with the other guests,"
5810,II,and the banquet proceeded. Presently a new instance of the wooers'
5811,II,"brutality was given, as if they were resolved to keep the edge of his"
5812,II,"anger fresh and keen. The author of this outrage was Ctesippus, a"
5813,II,"wealthy lord of Same. Taking up a bullock's foot from a basket, in"
5814,II,"which the refuse of the meal was thrown, he made this merry jest: ""The"
5815,II,"stranger has received an equal share of our meat, as is but right; for"
5816,II,who would wish to stint a guest of Telemachus? And now I will make him
5817,II,"a present over and above, that he may bestow somewhat on the"
5818,II,"bathwoman, or some other of the servants."" Suiting the action to the"
5819,II,"word he hurled the missile with savage force at Odysseus; but he, ever"
5820,II,"on the alert, avoided it by bowing his head, and it struck the wall"
5821,II,with a crash.
5822,II,
5823,II,"""Ctesippus,"" said Telemachus sternly, ""it is well for thee that thou"
5824,II,"hast missed, else thou hadst died by my hand. Is it not enough that ye"
5825,II,"slaughter my cattle and pour out my wine like water, but must I sit"
5826,II,here day after day while ye fill my house with riot and injury and
5827,II,"outrage?"""
5828,II,
5829,II,"The wooers sat silent, being somewhat abashed by the just rebuke; and"
5830,II,"after a long pause, one of them, whose name was Agelaus, answered"
5831,II,"mildly: ""Telemachus says well, for indeed he hath been sorely"
5832,II,"provoked. Let there be an end of these mad doings, which it is a shame"
5833,II,to see. And if Telemachus will be advised by me he will urge his
5834,II,"mother to make choice of a husband, that he may henceforth dwell"
5835,II,unmolested in his father's house. Why will she delay us further?
5836,II,Surely by this time she must have given up all hope of ever seeing
5837,II,"Odysseus again."""
5838,II,
5839,II,"""Now by the woes of my father!"" answered Telemachus, ""I hinder her not"
5840,II,"from wedding whom she pleases; nay, I bid her do so, and offer bridal"
5841,II,"gifts besides. But I cannot drive her by force from my doors."""
5842,II,
5843,II,His words had a strange effect on the wooers: with one accord they
5844,II,"broke out into a yelling peal of laughter, like women in a hysteric"
5845,II,"fit, while their eyes were filled with tears. And, more awful still!"
5846,II,"their meat dropped blood as they conveyed it to their lips, and an"
5847,II,"unearthly wailing was heard, like the cry of a spirit in torment."
5848,II,
5849,II,"Among those present was Theoclymenus, the man of second sight, and in"
5850,II,"that very hour the vision came upon him, and he cried aloud from the"
5851,II,"place where he sat: ""Woe unto you, ye doomed and miserable men! Thick"
5852,II,"darkness is wrapped about you, the darkness of the grave! All the air"
5853,II,"is loud with wailing, and your cheeks are wet with tears. See, see!"
5854,II,"the walls and the rafters are sprinkled with blood, and the porch and"
5855,II,"the courtyard are thronged with ghosts, hurrying downward to the"
5856,II,"nether pit; and the sun has died out of heaven, and all the house lies"
5857,II,"in darkness and the shadow of death."""
5858,II,
5859,II,"But the wooers had now recovered from their strange fit, and they"
5860,II,"laughed gaily at the terrible warning of the seer. ""Poor man!"" said"
5861,II,"Eurymachus, ""he has left his wits at home. Go, someone, and show him"
5862,II,"the way to the town, if he finds it so dark here."""
5863,II,
5864,II,"""I need no guide,"" answered Theoclymenus, ""I have eyes and ears, and"
5865,II,"feet, and a steady brain, so that I shall not go astray. Farewell,"
5866,II,"unhappy men! Your hour of grace is past."" And forthwith he arose and"
5867,II,went his way to the town.
5868,II,
5869,II,"When he was gone the wooers began jeering at Telemachus, and taunted"
5870,II,"him with the behaviour of his guests. ""Thou hast a rare taste,"" said"
5871,II,"one, ""in the choice of thy company! First, this filthy beggar that"
5872,II,"cumbers the ground with his greedy carcass, and after him comes the"
5873,II,"mad prophet, and screams like a raven over our meat"""
5874,II,
5875,II,One meaning glance passed between Telemachus and his father; the day
5876,II,"was drawing on, and they cared not now to bandy words with the wooers."
5877,II,"And so the merry feast came to an end with jesting, and mirth, and"
5878,II,laughter; and after a few short hours they were to sit down to
5879,II,"supper--such a supper as they had never tasted before, with a hero and"
5880,II,a goddess to spread the board.
5881,II,
5882,II,
5883,II,
5884,II,
5885,II,The Bow of Odysseus
5886,II,
5887,II,
5888,I,I
5889,I,
5890,I,The time had now arrived for the great trial of strength and skill of
5891,I,"which Penelope had spoken, and which was to decide deeper and deadlier"
5892,I,issues than those of marriage. Among the treasures which Odysseus had
5893,I,"left behind him was a famous bow, which he had received as a gift from"
5894,I,"Iphitus, son of Eurytus, whom he met in his youth during a visit to"
5895,I,"Messene. He who strung this bow, and shot an arrow through a line of"
5896,I,"axes set up in the hall, was to be rewarded by the hand of Penelope."
5897,I,
5898,I,"""Mother, it is time!"" whispered Telemachus, soon after the departure"
5899,I,"of Theoclymenus. Obeying the signal, Penelope, who had been sitting in"
5900,I,"the hall listening to the talk of the wooers, left her place, and"
5901,I,"ascending a steep staircase made her way to the store-room, which was"
5902,I,situated at the farther end of the house. In her hand she carried a
5903,I,"brazen key with a handle of ivory; and when she came to the door, she"
5904,I,"loosened the strap which served to draw the bolt from the outside, and"
5905,I,inserting the key drew back the bolt. The double doors flew open with
5906,I,"a crash, and the treasury with all its wealth was revealed. Great"
5907,I,"coffers of cedar-wood lined the walls, filled with fine raiment, which"
5908,I,"her own hands had wrought. It was a cool and quiet retreat, dimly"
5909,I,"lighted, remote from all rude sounds, full of fragrant odours, and fit"
5910,I,"to guard the possessions of a prince. And there, hanging from a pin,"
5911,I,"and heedfully wrapped in its case, was seen the fatal bow. She took it"
5912,I,"down, and, sitting on one of the coffers, laid it on her knees, and"
5913,I,gazed on it fondly with her eyes full of tears. How often had she seen
5914,I,"it in the hands of Odysseus, when he went forth at sunrise to hunt the"
5915,I,hare and the deer! How often had she taken it from him when he came
5916,I,back at evening loaded with the spoils of the chase! And now a keen
5917,I,"shaft from this very bow was to cut the last tender chord of memory,"
5918,I,and make her another man's wife!
5919,I,
5920,I,"With a heavy heart she took the bow with its quiver in her hands, and"
5921,I,"descending the staircase re-entered the hall, followed by her maidens,"
5922,I,who carried a chest containing the axes.
5923,I,
5924,I,"""Behold the bow, fair sirs!"" she said to the wooers, ""and behold me,"
5925,I,"the prize for this fine feat of archery!"" Therewith she gave the bow"
5926,I,"to Eumæus, who received it with tears; and Philoetius wept likewise"
5927,I,when he saw the treasured weapon of his lord. These signs of emotion
5928,I,"stirred the anger of Antinous, who rebuked the herdsmen fiercely."
5929,I,"""Peace, fools!"" he cried. ""Peace, miserable churls! Why pierce ye the"
5930,I,heart of the lady with your howlings? Has she not grief enough
5931,I,"already? Go forth, and howl with the dogs outside, and we will make"
5932,I,trial of the bow; yet me thinks it will be long ere anyone here shall
5933,I,"string it"""
5934,I,
5935,I,"""Anyone save thyself, thou wouldst say!"" rejoined Telemachus with a"
5936,I,"loud laugh. Then, seeing his mother regarding him with gentle"
5937,I,"reproach, he added: ""Tis strange that I should feel so gay and light"
5938,I,"of heart at the moment when I am about to lose my mother. Zeus,"
5939,I,"methinks, has turned my brain, and made me laugh when I should weep."
5940,I,"But come, ye bold wooers, which of you will be the first to enter the"
5941,I,"lists for this matchless prize, a lady without peer in all the land of"
5942,I,"Hellas? Why sit ye thus silent? Must I show you the way? So be it,"
5943,I,"then; and if I can bend the bow, and shoot an arrow straight, the"
5944,I,"prize shall be mine, and my mother shall abide here in her widowed"
5945,I,"state."""
5946,I,
5947,I,"So saying he sprang up, flung off his cloak, and laid aside his sword."
5948,I,"And first he made a long shallow trench in the floor of the hall, and"
5949,I,"set up the axes with their double heads in a straight line, stamping"
5950,I,down the earth about the handles to make all firm. Then he took the
5951,I,"bow from Eumæus; it was a weighty and powerful weapon, fashioned from"
5952,I,"the horns of an ibex, which were firmly riveted into a massive bridge,"
5953,I,and great force was required to string it. Telemachus set the end
5954,I,"against the floor, and strove with all his might to drive the string"
5955,I,"into its socket. Three times he tried, and failed; but the fourth"
5956,I,"time, making a great effort, he was on the point of succeeding, when"
5957,I,"his father nodded to him to desist. ""Plague on it!"" cried Telemachus,"
5958,I,"laying the bow aside with an air of vexation, ""must I be called a"
5959,I,"poltroon all my life, or is it that I have not yet attained the full"
5960,I,"measure of my strength? Let the others now take their turn."""
5961,I,
5962,I,"Then one by one the wooers rose up, in the order in which they sat,"
5963,I,"and tried to bend the bow. The first to essay it was Leiodes, a"
5964,I,"soothsayer, and a man of gentle and godly mind. But he was a soft"
5965,I,"liver, unpractised in all manly pastimes, and the bow was like iron in"
5966,I,"his white, womanish hands. ""I fear that this bow will make an end of"
5967,I,"many a bold spirit,"" he said, little guessing how true his words were"
5968,I,"to prove; ""for better it were to die than to go away beaten and broken"
5969,I,"men, after all the long years of our wooing."""
5970,I,
5971,I,"""Fie on thee!"" cried Antinous, ""thinkest thou that there are no better"
5972,I,men here than thou art? Doubt not that one of those present shall bend
5973,I,"the bow and win the lady."" Then he called Melanthius, and bade him"
5974,I,"light a fire, and bring a ball of lard to anoint the bow and make it"
5975,I,"easier to bend. The lard was brought, and the wooers sat in turn by"
5976,I,"the fire, rubbing and anointing the bow, but all to no purpose. Only"
5977,I,"Antinous and Eurymachus still held back, each in the full assurance"
5978,I,"that he, and none other, had strength to bend the bow."
5979,I,
5980,II,II
5981,II,
5982,II,Odysseus sat watching the wooers from his place at the upper end of
5983,II,"the hall, and his heart misgave him when he thought of the appalling"
5984,II,task which he had undertaken. He had acquitted himself like a hero in
5985,II,"many a hard-fought field, but never in all his life had he faced such"
5986,II,"odds as these. While he thus mused, and weighed the chances in his"
5987,II,"mind, he saw Eumæus and Philoetius leave the hall together, and pass"
5988,II,"out through the courtyard gate. Then a sudden thought struck him, and"
5989,II,"muttering to himself, ""I must risk it,"" he rose and followed the two"
5990,II,"men. He found them talking together outside the courtyard fence, and"
5991,II,in order to make trial of their temper he addressed them in these
5992,II,"cautious terms: ""Tell me truly, good friends, which side would ye"
5993,II,"take, if by some miracle Odysseus suddenly appeared in this house?"
5994,II,"Would ye be for the wooers or for him?"""
5995,II,
5996,II,Eumæus and Philoetius with one voice protested that they were ready to
5997,II,"hazard their lives for the rights of their master, whereupon Odysseus"
5998,II,"hesitated no longer, but answered: ""The miracle has been wrought; I am"
5999,II,he! After twenty years of toil and wandering Heaven hath brought me
6000,II,"home. I have watched ye both, and I know that ye alone among all the"
6001,II,"thralls remain true to me. Only continue steadfast for this day, and"
6002,II,"your reward is assured. I will build houses for ye both, close to my"
6003,II,"own, and ye shall dwell there with your wives, as my friends and"
6004,II,"neighbours, equals in honour with Telemachus, my son."""
6005,II,
6006,II,"The swineherd and neatherd listened with amazement, willing to"
6007,II,"believe, but still half in doubt; but when Odysseus showed them the"
6008,II,"scar, which they had seen many a time before, they were convinced, and"
6009,II,embraced their old master with tears and cries of joy. Having allowed
6010,II,"them some moments to indulge their feelings, Odysseus checked them"
6011,II,"with a warning gesture. ""Take heed to yourselves,"" he said, ""or your"
6012,II,cries will betray us. And now mark what I shall tell you. I will go
6013,II,"back to the house first, and do ye two follow me one by one. To thee,"
6014,II,"Philoetius, I give charge to make fast the gate of the courtyard, with"
6015,II,"bolt, and with bar, and with cord. And thou, Eumæus, when the time"
6016,II,"comes, shalt bring the bow and place it in my hands, whether the"
6017,II,"wooers cry out on thee or not; and when thou hast given me the bow, go"
6018,II,straightway and command the women to make fast the doors of their
6019,II,"apartments, and remain quiet by their work until I have finished what"
6020,II,"I have to do."""
6021,II,
6022,II,"At the moment when Odysseus returned to his place in the hall,"
6023,II,"Eurymachus was just making a last attempt to bend the bow. ""Out on"
6024,II,"it!"" he cried, finding all his efforts of no avail. ""It is a shame to"
6025,II,think how far beneath Odysseus we all are in the strength of our
6026,II,"hands; 'tis this that stings me, much more than the loss of the lady."""
6027,II,
6028,II,"""Thou mistakest the cause,"" answered Antinous. ""This day is the holy"
6029,II,"feast of the divine archer, Apollo, and doubtless he is jealous"
6030,II,because we try our skill in his own art on his sacred day. Let us
6031,II,"leave the axes where they stand, and try our fortune again to-morrow."""
6032,II,
6033,II,"The proposal was received with general applause, and forthwith the"
6034,II,"whole company called loud for wine, and began drinking heavily to"
6035,II,drown their disappointment Odysseus watched the progress of the revel
6036,II,"with grim satisfaction, and when the flushed faces and thick talk of"
6037,II,"the wooers showed that they were far gone in drunkenness he asked,"
6038,II,"with an air of deep humility, to be allowed to try his hand at"
6039,II,stringing the bow. His request was greeted with a loud cry of contempt
6040,II,and indignation from all the wooers; and Antinous especially was
6041,II,"highly incensed, threatening him with dire pains and penalties for his"
6042,II,"presumption. Hereupon Penelope interposed, and rebuked Antinous for"
6043,II,"his violence. ""Why should not the stranger try his skill with the"
6044,II,"rest?"" asked she. ""Thinkest thou that the poor man will win me for his"
6045,II,wife if he succeeds? Sure I am that he is not so foolish as to
6046,II,"entertain such a thought."""
6047,II,
6048,II,"""'Tis not for that,"" said Eurymachus, answering her. ""He cannot be so"
6049,II,mad as that. But what a shame to all this noble company if a houseless
6050,II,"beggar should accomplish a feat which none of us was able to perform."""
6051,II,
6052,II,"""Talk not of shame,"" replied Penelope with scorn. ""Are ye not covered"
6053,II,"with shame already, by your foul deeds done in this house in the"
6054,II,"absence of its lord? Give him the bow, I say! And if he string it, by"
6055,II,"Apollo's grace, I will clothe him in a new cloak and doublet, and give"
6056,II,"him a sharp javelin, to keep off dogs and men, and a two-edged sword,"
6057,II,"and sandals for his feet, and give him safe conduct to whatsoever"
6058,II,"place he desires to reach."""
6059,II,
6060,II,"The decisive moment was at hand, and Telemachus saw the necessity of"
6061,II,removing his mother from the scene of the approaching conflict.
6062,II,"""Mother,"" he said in a tone of authority, ""leave these things to me; I"
6063,II,"am master here. Evening draws on, and it is time for thee to retire."""
6064,II,
6065,II,"When Penelope had withdrawn, Eumæus took the bow, and was about to"
6066,II,"carry it to Odysseus, but paused half-way, in doubt and alarm, for a"
6067,II,"perfect storm of threats and abuse assailed his ears. ""Halt, thou dog!"
6068,II,"Put down the bow! Art thou tired of thy life?"" Appalled by the"
6069,II,"menacing cries of the wooers, the swineherd stood hesitating; but"
6070,II,"Telemachus raised his voice, and commanded him instantly to deliver"
6071,II,"the bow to Odysseus. ""I will teach thee,"" he said, ""who is thy master;"
6072,II,"thou shalt carry the marks of my hands to thy farm, if thou do not as"
6073,II,I tell thee. Would that I could as easily drive the whole of this
6074,II,"drunken rout from my doors!"""
6075,II,
6076,II,"""Well bragged, Sir Valiant!"" cried Antinous; and all the wooers"
6077,II,laughed boisterously when they heard him. Seizing his opportunity
6078,II,"while their attention was thus diverted, Eumæus came and placed the"
6079,II,"bow in the hands of Odysseus; then, calling Eurycleia, he bade her"
6080,II,make fast the door of the women's apartments. Meanwhile Philoetius
6081,II,"secured the gates of the courtyard, and returning to his place sat"
6082,II,watching the movements of Odysseus. With anxious eye the hero
6083,II,"scrutinised the great weapon, turning it this way and that, to see if"
6084,II,it had been injured by worms or natural decay. To his great joy he
6085,II,"found that it was sound and untouched. Then, easily as a minstrel"
6086,II,"fastens a new cord to a lyre, without effort he strung the bow, and"
6087,II,"bending it made the string twang loud and clear, like the shrill voice"
6088,II,of the swallow.
6089,II,
6090,II,"A hundred mocking eyes and sneering faces had been turned towards him,"
6091,II,as he sat fingering the bow and weighing it in his hands; but pale
6092,II,"grew those faces now, and blank was that gaze. To add to their terror,"
6093,II,at this moment a loud peal of thunder shook the house. Filled with
6094,II,"high courage by the happy omen, Odysseus took an arrow, and, fitting"
6095,II,"it to the string, sent it with sure aim from the place where he sat"
6096,II,"along the whole line of axeheads, from the first to the last."
6097,II,
6098,II,"""Telemachus,"" he said, ""thy guest hath not shamed thee. My hand is"
6099,II,"firm, and mine eye is true, poor worn-out wanderer though I be. Now"
6100,II,"let us give these fair guests their supper, and afterwards entertain"
6101,II,"them with music and with dancing, which are the fit accompaniment of a"
6102,II,"feast."""
6103,II,
6104,II,"Then he beckoned to his son to draw near; and Telemachus made haste,"
6105,II,"and came and stood by his father's side, armed with sword and lance."

6113,I,I
6114,I,
6115,I,"Stripping off his rags, and girding them round his waist, Odysseus"
6116,I,"took the quiver, and poured out all the arrows on the ground at his"
6117,I,"feet. ""Now guide my hand, Apollo,"" he cried, ""and make sure mine aim,"
6118,I,"for this time I will shoot at a mark which never man hit before."""
6119,I,
6120,I,"Therewith he bent his bow again, and pointed the arrow at Antinous,"
6121,I,who just at that moment was raising a full goblet of wine to his lips.
6122,I,"Little thought that proud and insolent man, as the wine gleamed red"
6123,I,"before him, that he had tasted his last morsel, and drunk his last"
6124,I,"drop. He was in the prime of his manhood, surrounded by his friends,"
6125,I,and in the midst of a joyous revel; who would dream of death and doom
6126,I,"in such an hour? Yet at that very instant he felt a sharp, sudden"
6127,I,"pang, and fell back in his seat, pierced through the throat by the"
6128,I,"arrow of Odysseus. The blood poured from his nostrils, he let fall the"
6129,I,"cup, and spurning the table with his feet in his agony he overset it,"
6130,I,and the bread and meat were scattered on the floor.
6131,I,
6132,I,"Then arose a wild clamour and uproar among the wooers, and starting"
6133,I,from their seats they sought eagerly for the weapons which were wont
6134,I,"to hang along the walls; but not a spear, not a shield, was to be"
6135,I,"seen. Finding themselves thus baffled, they turned furiously on"
6136,I,"Odysseus, shouting, ""Down with the knave!"" ""Hew him in pieces!"" ""Fling"
6137,I,"his carcass to the vultures!"" As yet they had not recognised him, and"
6138,I,they thought that he had slain Antinous by mischance.
6139,I,
6140,I,"They were soon undeceived. ""Ye dogs!"" he cried, in a terrible voice,"
6141,I,"""long have ye made my house into a den of thieves, thinking that I had"
6142,I,"died long ago in a distant land. Ye have devoured my living, and wooed"
6143,I,"my wife, and mishandled my servants, having no fear of god or man"
6144,I,before your eyes. But now are ye all fallen into the pit which ye have
6145,I,"digged, and are fast bound in the bonds of death."""
6146,I,
6147,I,"Like beaten hounds, that dastardly crew cowered before the man whom"
6148,I,"they had wronged, and every heart quaked with fear. Presently"
6149,I,"Eurymachus stood forward, and tried to make terms for them all. ""If"
6150,I,"thou be indeed Odysseus,"" he said, ""thou speakest justly concerning"
6151,I,the evil doings of the wooers. And there lies the cause of the
6152,I,"mischief, Antinous, struck down by thy righteous hand. He it was who"
6153,I,"sought to slay Telemachus, that he might usurp thy place, and make"
6154,I,"himself king in Ithaca. But now that he is gone to his own place, let"
6155,I,"us, the rest, find favour in thy sight. And as for thy possessions"
6156,I,"which have been wasted, we will pay thee back out of our own goods, as"
6157,I,"much as thou shalt require."""
6158,I,
6159,I,"But there were no signs of relenting on that stern, set face. ""Talk"
6160,I,"not to me of payment,"" he answered, with a brow as black as night; ""ye"
6161,I,"shall pay me with your lives, every one of you. Fight, if ye will, or"
6162,I,"die like sheep. Not one of you shall escape."""
6163,I,
6164,I,"Thus driven to extremity, Eurymachus drew his sword and shouting to"
6165,I,the others to follow his example he picked up a table to serve him as
6166,I,"a shield, and raising his war-cry rushed at Odysseus. In the midst of"
6167,I,"his onset an arrow struck him in the liver, and he fell doubled-up"
6168,I,"over a table, smiting the floor with his forehead. Then he rolled over"
6169,I,"with a groan, and his eyes grew dim in death."
6170,I,
6171,I,"Before Odysseus could fix another arrow to the string, Amphinomus was"
6172,I,"upon him, with sword uplifted to slay him. Telemachus saw his father's"
6173,I,"peril, and thrust Amphinomus in the back with his spear. The fall of"
6174,I,"their leaders arrested the advance of the wooers, and they drew back"
6175,I,in a body to the lower end of the hall. Leaving the spear in the body
6176,I,"of the fallen man, Telemachus ran to fetch armour for himself and"
6177,I,"Odysseus, and the two herdsmen. Quickly he brought shields and helmets"
6178,I,"and lances for the four, and they arrayed themselves and took their"
6179,I,stand together on the platform.
6180,I,
6181,I,"While these preparations were in progress, Odysseus continued"
6182,I,showering his arrows among the huddled troop of terrified men; and at
6183,I,"every shot one of the wooers fell. At last Melanthius, the goatherd,"
6184,I,made a desperate effort to save his party. Assisted by several of the
6185,I,"wooers, he climbed up the wall of the banquet-room, and made his exit"
6186,I,through the open timbers at the top into a narrow passage which gave
6187,I,"access to the inner part of the house. Presently he returned, laden"
6188,I,"with spears and shields and helmets, which he had found in the chamber"
6189,I,where they had been stored away by Telemachus.
6190,I,
6191,I,What was the dismay of Odysseus when he saw his enemies arming
6192,I,"themselves with spear and shield, and brandishing long lances in their"
6193,I,"hands! ""Telemachus!"" he cried, ""we are betrayed! The women have sold"
6194,I,"us to the wooers."" ""Alas! I have erred,"" answered Telemachus, ""for I"
6195,I,"left the door of the armoury open, and one of them has observed it."""
6196,I,
6197,I,"While they thus debated, Eumæus saw the goatherd making his way out of"
6198,I,"the hall again by the same exit. ""It is the traitor Melanthius,"" he"
6199,I,"whispered; ""now have we need of prompt action, or we are all undone."""
6200,I,
6201,I,"Odysseus had now recovered his courage, and he issued his orders"
6202,I,"without losing another moment. ""Go thou with the neatherd,"" he said to"
6203,I,"Eumæus, ""and seize that villain before he has time to return. Bind him"
6204,I,"hand and foot, and come back with all speed to the hall"""
6205,I,
6206,I,"At the side of the hall, close to the platform where Odysseus and his"
6207,I,"party were stationed, there was a door leading into the passage"
6208,I,"already mentioned. Through this the two men passed, and made their way"
6209,I,stealthily to the armoury. There they waited on either side of the
6210,I,"door for Melanthius, whom they heard moving within. Before long he"
6211,I,"came out, bearing in one hand a helmet, and in the other an old"
6212,I,"battered shield, once the property of Laertes. Together they fell upon"
6213,I,"him, dragged him down by the hair, and having bound him tight with a"
6214,I,long cord they hauled him up to a beam of the roof and left him
6215,I,"hanging. ""Long and sweet be thy slumbers, goatherd!"" said Eumæus as he"
6216,I,"contemplated his work, ""thou hast a soft bed, such as thou lovest."
6217,I,Rest there till the morning light shall call thee to make breakfast
6218,I,"for the wooers."""
6219,I,
6220,I,When they returned to the hall they found that a new ally had joined
6221,I,"their party, in the person of Mentor, the old friend of Odysseus. No"
6222,I,"one saw when he came thither; but there he was, and right glad they"
6223,I,were to see him. Very different were the feelings of the wooers when
6224,I,"they saw their enemies thus reinforced, and one of them, named"
6225,I,"Agelaus, cried out upon Mentor, and threatened him, saying: ""Give"
6226,I,"place, rash man, or thou wilt bring destruction on thyself and all thy"
6227,I,"house."""
6228,I,
6229,I,"When he heard that, Mentor was wroth, and rebuked Odysseus as slow of"
6230,I,"hand and cold of heart. ""Why standest thou idle?"" he cried. ""Get thee"
6231,I,"to thy weapons, and finish the work which thou hast to do, if thou art"
6232,I,verily that Odysseus who wrought such havoc among the Trojans in the
6233,I,"nine years' war."""
6234,I,
6235,I,With these words the supposed Mentor vanished as mysteriously as he
6236,I,"had appeared, and a little swallow was seen darting hither and thither"
6237,I,among the smoke-blackened beams of the roof.
6238,I,
6239,I,"The wooers understood not in whose presence they had been, and,"
6240,I,"thinking that Mentor had fled before their threats, they took courage"
6241,I,"again, and prepared to make a fresh assault. Agelaus now took the"
6242,I,"lead, and at his command six of them advanced and hurled their spears."
6243,I,"But they were all dazed with drink, and weakened by long habits of"
6244,I,"loose indulgence, and not one of their weapons took effect."
6245,I,
6246,I,"""Now hurl ye your spears!"" shouted Odysseus, and the four lances flew,"
6247,I,and four wooers bit the dust. At the next discharge from the wooers
6248,I,"Telemachus received a slight wound on the wrist, and Eumæus was"
6249,I,similarly injured on the shoulder by the spear of the brutal
6250,I,Ctesippus. A moment after Ctesippus himself was struck down by the
6251,I,"lance of Philoetius, who mocked him as he fell saying: ""There is for"
6252,I,"the ox-foot which thou didst lately bestow on Odysseus, thou noisy"
6253,I,"railer!"""
6254,I,
6255,I,"And so the great fight went on, and at every cast of the spear"
6256,I,Odysseus and his men added another to the list of the slain. Seeing
6257,I,"their numbers dwindling fast, the wretched remnant of the wooers lost"
6258,I,heart altogether and huddled together like sheep at the end of the
6259,I,hall. To complete their discomfiture a terrible voice was suddenly
6260,I,"heard in the air, and a gleam as from a bright shield was seen high up"
6261,I,"among the rafters. ""Tis Athene herself come to our aid!"" cried"
6262,I,"Odysseus; ""advance, and make an end of them. Athene is on our side!"""
6263,I,Forthwith they all sprang down from the platform and charged the
6264,I,"wooers, of whom some dozen still remained alive. What followed was not"
6265,I,"a battle, but a massacre. Like a drove of kine plunging frantically"
6266,I,"over a field, tortured by the sting of the hovering gadfly--like a"
6267,I,flock of small birds scattered by the sudden swoop of a falcon--the
6268,I,"panic-stricken wooers fled hither and thither through the hall,"
6269,I,seeking shelter behind pillars and under tables from the blows which
6270,I,rained upon them. But vain was their flight. In a very short time the
6271,I,"last of that guilty band was sent to his account, and the great act of"
6272,I,vengeance was completed.
6273,I,
6274,II,II
6275,II,
6276,II,"Like a lion fresh from the slaughter stood Odysseus, leaning on his"
6277,II,"spear, and covered with blood from head to foot. As he glared round"
6278,II,"him to see if any of his foes were still alive, his eye fell on"
6279,II,"Phemius, the minstrel, who was crouching in a corner near the side"
6280,II,"door, and clinging in terror to his harp. Seeing the stern gaze of"
6281,II,"Odysseus fixed upon him Phemius sprang forward, with a sudden impulse,"
6282,II,"and threw himself at the conqueror's feet, ""Pity me, Odysseus,"" he"
6283,II,"cried, ""and spare me! Thy days will be darkened by remorse if thou"
6284,II,slay the sweet minstrel whom gods and men revere. I am no common
6285,II,"school-taught bard, who sings what he has learned by rote; but in mine"
6286,II,"own heart is a sweet fountain of melody, which shall be shed like the"
6287,II,"dew from heaven on thy fame, and keep it green for ever. Therefore"
6288,II,"stay thy hand, and harm me not. Telemachus, thy son, knows that it was"
6289,II,"not of mine own will, nor for greed of gain, that I sang among the"
6290,II,"wooers, but they compelled me by force, being so many, and all"
6291,II,"stronger than I."""
6292,II,
6293,II,"Thus appealed to, Telemachus readily confirmed what the minstrel had"
6294,II,"said, which was indeed the literal truth. Then he thought of the"
6295,II,"trusty Medon, who had been kind to him when a child, and remained"
6296,II,"loyal to the last to him and Penelope. ""I trust he has not been slain"
6297,II,"among the wooers,"" he said. ""Medon, if thou art still alive, come"
6298,II,"forth and fear nothing."""
6299,II,
6300,II,"When he heard that, Medon, who had been huddled in a heap behind a"
6301,II,"chair, covered with a freshly-flayed ox-hide, flung off his covering,"
6302,II,and came running to Telemachus. The poor man was still half-mad with
6303,II,"terror. ""Here I am!"" he gasped, with staring eyes, ""speak to thy"
6304,II,"father, that he slay me not in his rage and his fury,"""
6305,II,
6306,II,"Odysseus smiled grimly at the poor serving-man, and bade him be of"
6307,II,"good cheer. ""Live,"" he said, ""thou and the minstrel, that ye may know,"
6308,II,"and tell it also to others, how much better are good deeds than evil."
6309,II,Now go ye forth and wait in the courtyard until I have finished what
6310,II,"remains to be done."" So forth they went, and sat down by the altar of"
6311,II,"Zeus, glancing fearfully about them, as if expecting every moment to"
6312,II,be their last.
6313,II,
6314,II,As soon as they were gone Odysseus walked slowly up and down the hall
6315,II,to see if any of the wooers still survived. But there was no sound or
6316,II,"motion, save the tread of his own feet, to break the awful stillness"
6317,II,"in that chamber of death. There they lay, stark and silent, heap upon"
6318,II,"heap, like a great draught of fishes which have been hauled to shore"
6319,II,"in a drag-net, and have gasped out their lives on the beach. Having"
6320,II,"assured himself that he had not done the work negligently, he bade"
6321,II,"Telemachus summon the nurse, Eurycleia. Telemachus obeyed, and going"
6322,II,"to the door of the women's apartments, he smote upon it, and called"
6323,II,"aloud to the nurse. A moment after the bolts were drawn back, and"
6324,II,Eurycleia entered the hall. When she saw Odysseus standing among the
6325,II,"heaps of slain wooers, she opened her mouth to utter a cry of triumph,"
6326,II,"but Odysseus checked her, saying: ""Hold thy peace, dame, and give not"
6327,II,voice to thy joy: it is an impious thing to exult over the dead. They
6328,II,"are the victims of heaven's righteous law, and I was but the"
6329,II,instrument of divine vengeance. Tell me now which of the women in the
6330,II,"house have dishonoured me, and which of them be blameless."""
6331,II,
6332,II,"""Behold I will tell thee all the truth,"" answered the nurse; ""fifty"
6333,II,"women there are in all in thy house, that card the wool and bear the"
6334,II,"yoke of bondage. And of these twelve have been faithless, honouring"
6335,II,"neither me nor Penelope, their mistress. But now let me go and tell"
6336,II,"the news to thy wife, who all this time has been lying in a deep"
6337,II,"sleep."""
6338,II,
6339,II,"""Rouse her not yet,"" said Odysseus, ""but go quickly and send those"
6340,II,"guilty women hither."""
6341,II,
6342,II,"While Eurycleia was gone to summon the maid-servants, Telemachus and"
6343,II,"the two herdsmen began, by the command of Odysseus, to set the hall in"
6344,II,"order, and wash away the traces of slaughter. Presently, with loud"
6345,II,"weeping and lamentation, the wretched women entered, and were"
6346,II,compelled to assist in the horrid task. The bodies of the slain were
6347,II,"carried out, and laid in order along the wall of the courtyard. Then"
6348,II,"they washed and scoured the tables, and scraped the floor with spades;"
6349,II,and when all was ready Odysseus bade his son and the two others to
6350,II,"drive the women forth, and slay them with the edge of the sword. So"
6351,II,"these three drove them into a corner of the courtyard, and Eumæus and"
6352,II,Philoetius drew their swords to slay them. But Telemachus held them
6353,II,"back saying: ""Let them die in shame, even as they have lived."" So they"
6354,II,"took a long ship's cable, which was lying in an outhouse, and"
6355,II,stretched it across an angle of the wall; to this they attached twelve
6356,II,"nooses, and left the women hanging there by the neck until they were"
6357,II,dead.
6358,II,
6359,II,A horrid death was reserved for the traitor Melanthius. Dragging him
6360,II,"out into the courtyard, they cut off his nose and ears, and his hands"
6361,II,"and feet, and so left him to die."
6362,II,
6363,II,After that they washed themselves and went back to the hall. Then
6364,II,"Odysseus bade Eurycleia kindle a fire, and bring sulphur to purify the"
6365,II,chamber. And having thoroughly cleansed the house from the fumes of
6366,II,"slaughter, he sat down to wait for the coming of his wife."

6375,I,
6376,I,"Her face beaming with joy, and her feet stumbling over one another in"
6377,I,"their haste, Eurycleia ascended to the chamber where Penelope lay"
6378,I,"sleeping. ""Awake, Penelope, awake!"" she cried, standing by the"
6379,I,"bedside; ""come and see with thine own eyes the fulfilment of all thy"
6380,I,"hopes. Odysseus has come home at last, and all the wooers lie slain by"
6381,I,"his hand!"""
6382,I,
6383,I,"""Thou art mad, nurse,"" answered Penelope pettishly, turning in her bed"
6384,I,"and rubbing her eyes; ""why mockest thou me in my sorrow with thy"
6385,I,folly? and why hast thou disturbed me in the sweetest sleep that ever
6386,I,"I had since the fatal, the accursed day when my lord sailed for Troy?"
6387,I,But for thy years and thy faithful service I would have paid thee
6388,I,"unkindly for this wanton insult"""
6389,I,
6390,I,"""Heaven forbid that I should mock or insult thee, dear child!"" cried"
6391,I,"the nurse, her eyes filling with tears. ""I have told thee naught but"
6392,I,the truth. The stranger whom we thought a beggar was Odysseus himself.
6393,I,"Telemachus knew this all the time, but kept it from thee by the"
6394,I,"command of his father."""
6395,I,
6396,I,"""May the gods ever bless thee for these tidings!"" said Penelope,"
6397,I,"springing from the couch, and throwing her arms round the nurse's"
6398,I,"neck. ""But tell me truly, how did he with his single hand gain the"
6399,I,"mastery over such a multitude?"""
6400,I,
6401,I,"""I saw not how it was done,"" answered Eurycleia. ""I heard but the"
6402,I,"groans of the men as they were stricken, for I was shut up with the"
6403,I,"handmaids in the women's chamber. When it was over, he called me, and"
6404,I,"I found him standing among the slain, like a lion by his prey. It was"
6405,I,"a sight to gladden thy heart."""
6406,I,
6407,I,"But Penelope's first impulse of joyful surprise had passed, and a cold"
6408,I,"fit of doubt and distrust succeeded, ""It cannot be!"" she murmured;"
6409,I,"""some god has taken the likeness of my husband, and slain the wooers."""
6410,I,"Even when Eurycleia told her how she had discovered the scar, while"
6411,I,"washing the feet of Odysseus, she remained unshaken in her unbelief."
6412,I,"""The counsels of the gods,"" she said, ""are beyond our knowing, and"
6413,I,they can take upon them disguises too deep for a poor woman's wit. But
6414,I,"come, let us go and see the slaughtered wooers, and their slayer,"
6415,I,"whoever he be."""
6416,I,
6417,II,II
6418,II,
6419,II,"Odysseus was sitting bowed over the fire, which shone redly on his"
6420,II,"face, as he leaned his head upon his hand. He was still clothed in his"
6421,II,"beggar's rags, and strangely disfigured by the magic power of Athene;"
6422,II,"while the red stains of slaughter, which still lay thick upon him,"
6423,II,served to render his disguise yet deeper. Small wonder then that
6424,II,"Penelope hesitated long to acknowledge him for her husband, as she sat"
6425,II,"some way off scanning his features with timid yet attentive gaze, like"
6426,II,one who strives to decipher a blurred and blotted manuscript. More
6427,II,"than once she started up, as if about to fall upon his neck; then the"
6428,II,"gleam which had lighted up her face died away, her arms drooped"
6429,II,"listlessly at her side, and she remained motionless and cold."
6430,II,
6431,II,"When this had lasted for some time, Telemachus, who was present,"
6432,II,"rebuked his mother in angry terms, saying: ""Fie upon thee, my mother!"
6433,II,"hast thou no heart at all? Why holdest thou thus aloof from my father,"
6434,II,who has come back to thee after twenty years of suffering and toil?
6435,II,"But 'twas ever thus with thee--thou art harder than stone."""
6436,II,
6437,II,"""My child,"" answered Penelope, ""I am sore amazed; I cannot speak, or"
6438,II,"ask any question, or look him in the face. But if this man be indeed"
6439,II,"my husband, he knows how to convince me, and scatter all my doubts to"
6440,II,"the winds, for there are secrets between us whereof no one knoweth,"
6441,II,"save only ourselves."""
6442,II,
6443,II,"Odysseus smiled at his wife's caution. ""Not in vain,"" he thought, ""is"
6444,II,"she known to all the world as the prudent Penelope."" Then, in order to"
6445,II,"give her time, he turned to Telemachus and said: ""Come not between my"
6446,II,"wife and me, Telemachus; we shall know each other in due season. I"
6447,II,"have another charge for thee, and do thou mark heedfully what I shall"
6448,II,"say. We have slain the noblest in the land, not one, but many, who"
6449,II,leave a host of friends to take up their cause: how then shall we
6450,II,"escape the blood feud? We had best look to it warily and well."""
6451,II,
6452,II,"""Father,"" answered Telemachus, ""thou hast the name of wise, beyond all"
6453,II,"living men. Be it thine, therefore, to declare thy counsel, and I will"
6454,II,"follow it, to the utmost stretch of my power."""
6455,II,
6456,II,"""Thus, then, shalt thou do,"" said Odysseus: ""let all the household put"
6457,II,"on clean raiment, and bid the minstrel take his harp and make sweet"
6458,II,"music for the festal dance. Then foot it merrily, everyone, that all"
6459,II,they who pass by the house may think that ye are keeping the marriage
6460,II,feast. In this wise the rumour of the wooers' death shall not reach
6461,II,the town until we have had time to collect our men and prepare for our
6462,II,"defence."""
6463,II,
6464,II,Telemachus went forthwith to carry out his father's orders. The whole
6465,II,"household, men and women, arrayed themselves in festal attire, and"
6466,II,"soon the hall echoed to the throbbing notes of the lyre, and the loud"
6467,II,patter of the dancers' feet. And those who heard it from without said
6468,II,"to one another: ""So the long wooing of our queen has come to an end at"
6469,II,"last! Fickle woman, that could not endure unto the end, and keep faith"
6470,II,"with the husband of her youth!"""
6471,II,
6472,III,III
6473,III,
6474,III,"After giving his orders to Telemachus, Odysseus had retired to refresh"
6475,III,"himself with the bath, and put on fresh raiment, while Penelope"
6476,III,remained seated in her former place. After an interval of some length
6477,III,"he re-entered the hall, and sat down face to face with his wife. But"
6478,III,"what miracle was this? The haggard, timeworn beggar was gone, and in"
6479,III,"his place sat her husband, as she had known him in the days of old,"
6480,III,with the added dignity which he had gained by twenty years of
6481,III,strenuous life. But the frost which had lain upon her spirit during
6482,III,"her long period of weary waiting was not easily to be broken, and"
6483,III,"still she doubted. After a long silence Odysseus spoke, and now for"
6484,III,"the first time his tones had a ring of reproach: ""Still not a word for"
6485,III,"thy husband, who has come back to thee after twenty years? Surely the"
6486,III,"very demon of unbelief possesses thee!"" Even then Penelope made no"
6487,III,"answer, for she was waiting to put the final test, and at length"
6488,III,"Odysseus gave her the opportunity. ""Go, Eurycleia,"" he said, ""and"
6489,III,prepare a bed for me; I will leave this iron-hearted wife and go to my
6490,III,"rest."""
6491,III,
6492,III,"""Ay, do so,"" said Penelope, ""take the bed from the chamber which he"
6493,III,"built with his own hands, and lay it in another room, that he may"
6494,III,"slumber there."" This she said to prove him, for the bed and the"
6495,III,"chamber had a secret history, known only to herself and her husband"
6496,III,and the faithful nurse.
6497,III,
6498,III,Odysseus rose bravely to the test: whether divining his wife's purpose
6499,III,"or not, he exclaimed, with an air of surprise and indignation: ""Lady,"
6500,III,what meanest thou by this order? Who hath moved my bed from its place?
6501,III,"He must be of more than mortal skill who could remove it, for it was"
6502,III,"fashioned in wondrous wise, and with my own hands I wrought it, to be"
6503,III,a sign and a secret between thee and me. And this was the manner of
6504,III,"the work. Within the courtyard there grew an olive-tree, a fair tree"
6505,III,"and a large, with a world of green leaves, and a stem like a stout"
6506,III,pillar. Round this I built the walls of the chamber with close-fitting
6507,III,"stones, and roofed it over, and hung the door on its hinges. Then I"
6508,III,"went to work on the tree, lopping off the boughs, and smoothing the"
6509,III,"trunk with the adze, so as to fashion it into a bedpost, and beginning"
6510,III,"from this I made the frame of a bed, and decorated it with gold and"
6511,III,"silver and ivory, and over the frame I stretched broad bands of"
6512,III,"ox-hide, stained with bright purple. This I tell thee as a sign by"
6513,III,"which thou mayest know me."""
6514,III,
6515,III,"The last shadow was now removed, and before Odysseus had well ended"
6516,III,"what he was saying Penelope sprang towards him, threw her arms round"
6517,III,"his neck, and covered his face with kisses. ""Be not angry with me, my"
6518,III,"dear lord,"" she murmured tenderly, ""because I held back so long, and"
6519,III,"gave thee not loving welcome, as I do now. Thou art very wise, and"
6520,III,knowest the dangers which beset a lonely woman who is over hasty to
6521,III,believe when a stranger comes and calls himself her husband. Many
6522,III,there be that lie in wait to lay snares for a weak and loving heart.
6523,III,"But now I know thee for mine own dear love, and now is the winter of"
6524,III,"my widowhood made glorious summer, since I have seen thy face again."""
6525,III,
6526,III,"So they sat locked in each other's arms, that valiant, long-suffering"
6527,III,"man, and his faithful wife, two brave and patient souls, parted so"
6528,III,"long, and tried so hard, but now united once more in wedded love and"
6529,III,"bliss. The hours went by unheeded, and day would have overtaken them"
6530,III,"in that trance of delight, had not Athene marked them with pity from"
6531,III,"her heavenly seat, and stayed the steeds of the morning in the east,"
6532,III,"and prolonged the reign of night, that the joy of that first meeting"
6533,III,might not be broken until they had tasted all its honey to the lees.

6541,I,I
6542,I,
6543,I,"Early next day Odysseus rose and donned his armour, and having charged"
6544,I,"Penelope to keep close in her chamber, and admit no one into the"
6545,I,"house, he set forth to visit Laertes on his farm, attended by"
6546,I,"Telemachus and the two faithful herdsmen, all armed to the teeth."
6547,I,"Arrived at the farmhouse he left his companions there, bidding them"
6548,I,"prepare the morning meal, and went out alone to find his father."
6549,I,"Passing through the courtyard gate, he entered a large plot of ground,"
6550,I,planted by Laertes as a garden and orchard; and there he found the old
6551,I,"man, who was digging about the roots of a young tree. With strange"
6552,I,emotions Odysseus noted every detail of his dress and figure--the
6553,I,"soiled and tattered coat, the gaiters of clouted leather, the old"
6554,I,"gauntlets on his hands, and the goatskin cap. He who had once been the"
6555,I,wealthiest prince in Ithaca had now the appearance of an ancient
6556,I,"serving-man, broken down with years and toil."
6557,I,
6558,I,But in the midst of his sorrow a freakish whim came into the head of
6559,I,"Odysseus, characteristic of his subtle and tortuous nature."
6560,I,"Approaching his father, who was still stooping over his work, he said"
6561,I,"to him in a disguised voice: ""Old man, I perceive that thou art well"
6562,I,skilled in the gardener's art: never saw I a garden better tended--not
6563,I,"a tree, not a shrub, but bears witness to thy fostering care. And be"
6564,I,not wroth with me if I say that is a wonder to see the keeper of so
6565,I,fair a garden himself so squalid and unkempt. Surely he whom thou
6566,I,"servest must be an ungrateful master. Tell me his name, if thou wilt,"
6567,I,and answer me truly if this be indeed the land of Ithaca to which I am
6568,I,"come, as I heard from a man whom I met by the way. He seemed a"
6569,I,"churlish fellow, and would not stay to answer my questions; for I was"
6570,I,fain to ask him concerning a friend whom I once entertained in my
6571,I,"house, a native of Ithaca, as he told me, and a son of one Laertes."
6572,I,"Many days he dwelt with me, eating and drinking of the best, and I"
6573,I,"sent him away laden with rich gifts, gold and silver, and costly"
6574,I,"raiment."""
6575,I,
6576,I,"""Friend,"" answered Laertes, shedding tears, ""to Ithaca indeed art thou"
6577,I,"come, but he of whom thou askest is no longer here. In vain were thy"
6578,I,"gifts bestowed, for he who would have repaid thee richly for all thy"
6579,I,"kindness hath perished long ago, and his bones lie bleaching on the"
6580,I,"bare earth, or at the bottom of the sea. Tell me, how long is it since"
6581,I,"thou didst receive him, and who art thou, and where is thy home?"""
6582,I,
6583,I,"""I am a man of Alybas,"" replied Odysseus, ""the son of Apheidas the son"
6584,I,"of Polypemon, and Eperitus is my name; and it is now five years since"
6585,I,Odysseus departed from my home. Fair omens attended him on his
6586,I,"starting, and we parted in high hopes that we should meet again in his"
6587,I,"own land."""
6588,I,
6589,I,At these words of Odysseus the poor old man was overwhelmed with
6590,I,"sorrow, and he heaped dust upon his grey head, groaning in bitterness"
6591,I,"of spirit. Odysseus was moved with pity at the sight of his distress,"
6592,I,"and thinking that he had now tried him enough, he revealed himself,"
6593,I,"pointing as proofs to the scar above his knee, and to certain trees"
6594,I,"which Laertes had allowed him to call his own when he walked with him,"
6595,I,"hand-in-hand, as a little child, through the garden."
6596,I,
6597,I,"The sudden shock of joyful recognition was too much for the old man,"
6598,I,and he fell fainting into his son's arms. When he was somewhat
6599,I,"recovered they went back together towards the house, and on the way"
6600,I,"Odysseus spoke of the slaying of the wooers, and of the danger which"
6601,I,threatened him from the vengeance of their friends.
6602,I,
6603,II,II
6604,II,
6605,II,Meanwhile the news of the wooers' violent death had spread like
6606,II,"wildfire through the island, and their kinsmen went with loud clamour"
6607,II,to the house of Odysseus to carry away the dead bodies. When this was
6608,II,done they gathered together at the place of assembly to devise some
6609,II,"plan of vengeance; and Eupeithes, the father of Antinous, made violent"
6610,II,outcry against Odysseus for his great act of savage justice.
6611,II,
6612,II,"While they were debating, Medon and Phemius appeared on the scene, and"
6613,II,"described the manner in which the wooers had met their end. ""The hand"
6614,II,"of Heaven,"" said Medon, ""was made manifest in the deed. I myself saw"
6615,II,"Athene leading the onset, and your sons were laid low like ripe"
6616,II,"sheaves before the sickle."" This report chilled their courage not a"
6617,II,"little; and Halitherses, seeing the effect produced, exerted all his"
6618,II,eloquence to put an end to the blood feud. Nevertheless more than half
6619,II,"of those present persisted in their purpose, and donning their armour"
6620,II,went forth from the town to meet the party of Odysseus.
6621,II,
6622,II,"The encounter took place in front of the farmhouse, where Odysseus and"
6623,II,"the others had just taken their morning meal. Laertes, who seemed to"
6624,II,"have recovered all the vigour of his youth, led the attack, and by a"
6625,II,"well-aimed cast of his lance struck down Eupeithes, the leader of the"
6626,II,"opposing party. This success was followed up by a vigorous charge, in"
6627,II,"the midst of which a supernatural voice was heard in the air, striking"
6628,II,"terror into the assailants of Odysseus, who turned and fled in wild"
6629,II,"panic towards the town. They were hotly pursued, and not a man would"
6630,II,have been left alive had not Zeus himself interposed to stay the
6631,II,slaughter. By his command Athene acted as mediator between Odysseus
6632,II,"and the kinsmen of the wooers, and an oath of amnesty was taken on"
6633,II,"both sides, confirmed with solemn prayer and sacrifice."
