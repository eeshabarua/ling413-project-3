38,PREFACE,
39,PREFACE,"In _Homer and the Epic_, ten or twelve years ago, I examined the"
40,PREFACE,literary objections to Homeric unity. These objections are chiefly based
41,PREFACE,"on alleged discrepancies in the narrative, of which no one poet, it"
42,PREFACE,"is supposed, could have been guilty. The critics repose, I venture"
43,PREFACE,"to think, mainly on a fallacy. We may style it the fallacy of ""the"
44,PREFACE,"analytical reader."" The poet is expected to satisfy a minutely critical"
45,PREFACE,"reader, a personage whom he could not foresee, and whom he did not"
46,PREFACE,"address. Nor are ""contradictory instances"" examined--that is, as Blass"
47,PREFACE,"has recently reminded his countrymen, Homer is put to a test which"
48,PREFACE,"Goethe could not endure. No long fictitious narrative can satisfy ""the"
49,PREFACE,"analytical reader."""
50,PREFACE,
51,PREFACE,The fallacy is that of disregarding the Homeric poet's audience. He
52,PREFACE,"did not sing for Aristotle or for Aristarchus, or for modern minute"
53,PREFACE,"and reflective inquirers, but for warriors and ladies. He certainly"
54,PREFACE,"satisfied them; but if he does not satisfy microscopic professors, he is"
55,PREFACE,"described as a syndicate of many minstrels, living in many ages."
56,PREFACE,
57,PREFACE,In the present volume little is said in defence of the poet's
58,PREFACE,consistency. Several chapters on that point have been excised. The way
59,PREFACE,"of living which Homer describes is examined, and an effort is made to"
60,PREFACE,prove that he depicts the life of a single brief age of culture. The
61,PREFACE,"investigation is compelled to a tedious minuteness, because the points"
62,PREFACE,of attack--the alleged discrepancies in descriptions of the various
63,PREFACE,details of existence--are so minute as to be all but invisible.
64,PREFACE,
65,PREFACE,The unity of the Epics is not so important a topic as the methods of
66,PREFACE,"criticism. They ought to be sober, logical, and self-consistent. When"
67,PREFACE,"these qualities are absent, Homeric criticism may be described, in the"
68,PREFACE,"recent words of Blass, as ""a swamp haunted by wandering fires, will o'"
69,PREFACE,"the wisps."""
70,PREFACE,
71,PREFACE,In our country many of the most eminent scholars are no believers in
72,PREFACE,separatist criticism. Justly admiring the industry and erudition of the
73,PREFACE,"separatists, they are unmoved by their arguments, to which they do"
74,PREFACE,"not reply, being convinced in their own minds. But the number and"
75,PREFACE,"perseverance of the separatists make on ""the general reader"" the"
76,PREFACE,"impression that Homeric unity is chose _jugée_, that _scientia locuta"
77,PREFACE,"est_, and has condemned Homer. This is far from being the case: the"
78,PREFACE,"question is still open; ""science"" herself is subject to criticism; and"
79,PREFACE,"new materials, accruing yearly, forbid a tame acquiescence in hasty"
80,PREFACE,theories.
81,PREFACE,
82,PREFACE,"May I say a word to the lovers of poetry who, in reading Homer, feel no"
83,PREFACE,"more doubt than in reading Milton that, on the whole, they are studying"
84,PREFACE,"a work of one age, by one author? Do not let them be driven from their"
85,PREFACE,natural impression by the statement that Science has decided against
86,PREFACE,them. The certainties of the exact sciences are one thing: the opinions
87,PREFACE,of Homeric commentators are other and very different things. Among all
88,PREFACE,the branches of knowledge which the Homeric critic should have at his
89,PREFACE,"command, only philology, archaeology, and anthropology can be called"
90,PREFACE,"""sciences""; and they are not exact sciences: they are but skirmishing"
91,PREFACE,advances towards the true solution of problems prehistoric and
92,PREFACE,"""proto-historic."""
93,PREFACE,
94,PREFACE,"Our knowledge shifts from day to day; on every hand, in regard to almost"
95,PREFACE,"every topic discussed, we find conflict of opinions. There is no certain"
96,PREFACE,"scientific decision, but there is the possibility of working in the"
97,PREFACE,"scientific spirit, with breadth of comparison; consistency of logic;"
98,PREFACE,economy of conjecture; abstinence from the piling of hypothesis on
99,PREFACE,hypothesis.
100,PREFACE,
101,PREFACE,Nothing can be more hurtful to science than the dogmatic assumption that
102,PREFACE,the hypothesis most in fashion is scientific.
103,PREFACE,
104,PREFACE,"Twenty years ago, the philological theory of the Solar Myth was preached"
105,PREFACE,"as ""scientific"" in the books, primers, and lectures of popular science."
106,PREFACE,To-day its place knows it no more. The separatist theories of the
107,PREFACE,"Homeric poems are not more secure than the Solar Myth, ""like a wave"
108,PREFACE,"shall they pass and be passed."""
109,PREFACE,
110,PREFACE,"When writing on ""The Homeric House"" (Chapter X.) I was unacquainted with"
111,PREFACE,"Mr. Percy Gardner's essay, ""The Palaces of Homer"" (_Journal of Hellenic"
112,PREFACE,"Studies_, vol. iii. pp. 264-282). Mr. Gardner says that Dasent's plan"
113,PREFACE,"of the Scandinavian Hall ""offers in most respects not likeness, but a"
114,PREFACE,"striking contrast to the early Greek hall."" Mr. Monro, who was not aware"
115,PREFACE,of the parallel which I had drawn between the Homeric and Icelandic
116,PREFACE,"houses, accepted it on evidence more recent than that of Sir George"
117,PREFACE,"Dasent. Cf. his _Odyssey_, vol. ii. pp. 490-494."
118,PREFACE,
119,PREFACE,"Mr. R. W. Raper, of Trinity College, Oxford, has read the proof sheets"
120,PREFACE,"of this work with his habitual kindness, but is in no way responsible"
121,PREFACE,for the arguments. Mr. Walter Leaf has also obliged me by mentioning
122,PREFACE,"some points as to which I had not completely understood his position,"
123,PREFACE,and I have tried as far as possible to represent his ideas correctly. I
124,PREFACE,have also received assistance from the wide and minute Homeric lore of
125,PREFACE,"Mr. A. Shewan, of St. Andrews, and have been allowed to consult other"
126,PREFACE,scholars on various points.

128,PREFACE,"The first portion of the chapter on ""Bronze and Iron"" appeared in the"
129,PREFACE,"Revue _Archéologique_ for April 1905, and the editor, Monsieur Salomon"
130,PREFACE,"Reinach, obliged me with a note on the bad iron swords of the Celts as"
131,PREFACE,described by Polybius.

211,THE HOMERIC AGE,THE HOMERIC AGE
212,THE HOMERIC AGE,
213,THE HOMERIC AGE,"The aim of this book is to prove that the Homeric Epics, as wholes, and"
214,THE HOMERIC AGE,"apart from passages gravely suspected in antiquity, present a perfectly"
215,THE HOMERIC AGE,harmonious picture of the entire life and civilisation of one single
216,THE HOMERIC AGE,age. The faint variations in the design are not greater than such as
217,THE HOMERIC AGE,"mark every moment of culture, for in all there is some movement; in all,"
218,THE HOMERIC AGE,"cases are modified by circumstances. If our contention be true, it will"
219,THE HOMERIC AGE,"follow that the poems themselves, as wholes, are the product of a single"
220,THE HOMERIC AGE,"age, not a mosaic of the work of several changeful centuries."
221,THE HOMERIC AGE,
222,THE HOMERIC AGE,"This must be the case--if the life drawn is harmonious, the picture"
223,THE HOMERIC AGE,must be the work of a single epoch--for it is not in the nature of early
224,THE HOMERIC AGE,"uncritical times that later poets should adhere, or even try to adhere,"
225,THE HOMERIC AGE,"to the minute details of law, custom, opinion, dress, weapons, houses,"
226,THE HOMERIC AGE,"and so on, as presented in earlier lays or sagas on the same set"
227,THE HOMERIC AGE,of subjects. Even less are poets in uncritical times inclined to
228,THE HOMERIC AGE,"""archaise,"" either by attempting to draw fancy pictures of the manners"
229,THE HOMERIC AGE,"of the past, or by making researches in graves, or among old votive"
230,THE HOMERIC AGE,"offerings in temples, for the purpose of ""preserving local colour."" The"
231,THE HOMERIC AGE,idea of such archaising is peculiar to modern times. To take an instance
232,THE HOMERIC AGE,"much to the point, Virgil was a learned poet, famous for his antiquarian"
233,THE HOMERIC AGE,"erudition, and professedly imitating and borrowing from Homer. Now, had"
234,THE HOMERIC AGE,"Virgil worked as a man of to-day would work on a poem of Trojan times,"
235,THE HOMERIC AGE,he would have represented his heroes as using weapons of bronze.
236,THE HOMERIC AGE,"[Footnote: Looking back at my own poem, _Helen of Troy_ (1883), I find"
237,THE HOMERIC AGE,that when the metal of a weapon is mentioned the metal is bronze.] No
238,THE HOMERIC AGE,"such idea of archaising occurred to the learned Virgil. It is ""the iron"""
239,THE HOMERIC AGE,"that pierces the head of Remulus (_Aeneid_, IX. 633); it is ""the iron"""
240,THE HOMERIC AGE,"that waxes warm in the breast of Antiphates (IX. 701). Virgil's men,"
241,THE HOMERIC AGE,"again, do not wear the great Homeric shield, suspended by a baldric:"
242,THE HOMERIC AGE,"AEneas holds up his buckler (_clipeus_), borne ""on his left arm"" (X. 26"
243,THE HOMERIC AGE,"i). Homer, familiar with no buckler worn on the left arm, has no such"
244,THE HOMERIC AGE,"description. When the hostile ranks are to be broken, in the _Aeneid_ it"
245,THE HOMERIC AGE,"is ""with the iron"" (X. 372), and so throughout."
246,THE HOMERIC AGE,
247,THE HOMERIC AGE,"The most erudite ancient poet, in a critical age of iron, does not"
248,THE HOMERIC AGE,"archaise in our modern fashion. He does not follow his model, Homer, in"
249,THE HOMERIC AGE,"his descriptions of shields, swords, and spears. But, according to"
250,THE HOMERIC AGE,"most Homeric critics, the later continuators of the Greek Epics, about"
251,THE HOMERIC AGE,"800-540 B.C., are men living in an age of iron weapons, and of round"
252,THE HOMERIC AGE,"bucklers worn on the left arm. Yet, unlike Virgil, they always give"
253,THE HOMERIC AGE,"their heroes arms of bronze, and, unlike Virgil (as we shall see),"
254,THE HOMERIC AGE,they do not introduce the buckler worn on the left arm. They adhere
255,THE HOMERIC AGE,"conscientiously to the use of the vast Mycenaean shield, in their time"
256,THE HOMERIC AGE,"obsolete. Yet, by the theory, in many other respects they innovate"
257,THE HOMERIC AGE,"at will, introducing corslets and greaves, said to be unknown to the"
258,THE HOMERIC AGE,"beginners of the Greek Epics, just as Virgil innovates in bucklers and"
259,THE HOMERIC AGE,"iron weapons. All this theory seems inconsistent, and no ancient poet,"
260,THE HOMERIC AGE,"not even Virgil, is an archaiser of the modern sort."
261,THE HOMERIC AGE,
262,THE HOMERIC AGE,All attempts to prove that the Homeric poems are the work of several
263,THE HOMERIC AGE,"centuries appear to rest on a double hypothesis: first, that the later"
264,THE HOMERIC AGE,contributors to the _ILIAD_ kept a steady eye on the traditions of the
265,THE HOMERIC AGE,"remote Achaean age of bronze; next, that they innovated as much as they"
266,THE HOMERIC AGE,pleased.
267,THE HOMERIC AGE,
268,THE HOMERIC AGE,Poets of an uncritical age do not archaise. This rule is overlooked by
269,THE HOMERIC AGE,the critics who represent the Homeric poems as a complex of the work of
270,THE HOMERIC AGE,"many singers in many ages. For example, Professor Percy Gardner, in his"
271,THE HOMERIC AGE,"very interesting _New chapters in Greek History_ (1892), carries neglect"
272,THE HOMERIC AGE,"of the rule so far as to suppose that the late Homeric poets, being"
273,THE HOMERIC AGE,"aware that the ancient heroes could not ride, or write, or eat boiled"
274,THE HOMERIC AGE,"meat, consciously and purposefully represented them as doing none of"
275,THE HOMERIC AGE,"these things. This they did ""on the same principle on which a writer of"
276,THE HOMERIC AGE,pastoral idylls in our own day would avoid the mention of the telegraph
277,THE HOMERIC AGE,"or telephone."" [Footnote: _Op. cit._, p. 142.] ""A writer of our own"
278,THE HOMERIC AGE,"day,""--there is the pervading fallacy! It is only writers of the last"
279,THE HOMERIC AGE,century who practise this archaeological refinement. The authors of
280,THE HOMERIC AGE,"_Beowulf_ and the _Nibelungenlied_, of the Chansons de _Geste_ and of"
281,THE HOMERIC AGE,"the Arthurian romances, always describe their antique heroes and the"
282,THE HOMERIC AGE,"details of their life in conformity with the customs, costume, and"
283,THE HOMERIC AGE,armour of their own much later ages.
284,THE HOMERIC AGE,
285,THE HOMERIC AGE,"But Mr. Leaf, to take another instance, remarks as to the lack of the"
286,THE HOMERIC AGE,"metal lead in the Epics, that it is mentioned in similes only, as though"
287,THE HOMERIC AGE,the poet were aware the metal was unknown in the heroic age. [Footnote:
288,THE HOMERIC AGE,"_Iliad_, Note on, xi. 237.] Here the poet is assumed to be a careful"
289,THE HOMERIC AGE,"but ill-informed archaeologist, who wishes to give an accurate"
290,THE HOMERIC AGE,"representation of the past. Lead, in fact, was perfectly familiar to the"
291,THE HOMERIC AGE,"Mycenaean prime. [Footnote: Tsountas and Manatt, p. 73.] The critical"
292,THE HOMERIC AGE,usage of supposing that the ancients were like the most recent
293,THE HOMERIC AGE,moderns--in their archaeological preoccupations--is a survival of the
294,THE HOMERIC AGE,uncritical habit which invariably beset old poets and artists. Ancient
295,THE HOMERIC AGE,"poets, of the uncritical ages, never worked ""on the same principle as a"
296,THE HOMERIC AGE,"writer in our day,"" as regards archaeological precision; at least we are"
297,THE HOMERIC AGE,acquainted with no example of such accuracy.
298,THE HOMERIC AGE,
299,THE HOMERIC AGE,Let us take another instance of the critical fallacy. The age of the
300,THE HOMERIC AGE,"Achaean warriors, who dwelt in the glorious halls of Mycenae, was"
301,THE HOMERIC AGE,"followed, at an interval, by the age represented in the relics found in"
302,THE HOMERIC AGE,"the older tombs outside the Dipylon gate of Athens, an age beginning,"
303,THE HOMERIC AGE,"probably, about 900-850 B.C. The culture of this ""Dipylon age,"" a"
304,THE HOMERIC AGE,"time of geometrical ornaments on vases, and of human figures drawn in"
305,THE HOMERIC AGE,"geometrical forms, lines, and triangles, was quite unlike that of the"
306,THE HOMERIC AGE,"Achaean age in many ways, for example, in mode of burial and in the use"
307,THE HOMERIC AGE,"of iron for weapons. Mr. H. R. Hall, in his learned book, _The Oldest"
308,THE HOMERIC AGE,"Civilisation of Greece_ (1901), supposes the culture described in the"
309,THE HOMERIC AGE,Homeric poems to be contemporary in Asia with that of this Dipylon
310,THE HOMERIC AGE,"period in Greece. [Footnote: Op. cit., pp. 49, 222.] He says, ""The"
311,THE HOMERIC AGE,Homeric culture is evidently the culture of the poet's own days; there
312,THE HOMERIC AGE,"is no attempt to archaise here...."" They do not archaise as to the"
313,THE HOMERIC AGE,"details of life, but ""the Homeric poets consciously and consistently"
314,THE HOMERIC AGE,"archaised, in regard to the political conditions of continental Greece,"""
315,THE HOMERIC AGE,"in the Achaean times. They give ""in all probability a pretty accurate"
316,THE HOMERIC AGE,"description"" of the loose feudalism of Mycenaean Greece. [Footnote: Op."
317,THE HOMERIC AGE,"cit., pp. 223, 225.]"
318,THE HOMERIC AGE,
319,THE HOMERIC AGE,We shall later show that this Homeric picture of a past political and
320,THE HOMERIC AGE,"social condition of Greece is of vivid and delicate accuracy, that it"
321,THE HOMERIC AGE,"is drawn from the life, not constructed out of historical materials. Mr."
322,THE HOMERIC AGE,"Hall explains the fact by ""the conscious and consistent"" archaeological"
323,THE HOMERIC AGE,precision of the Asiatic poets of the ninth century. Now to any one
324,THE HOMERIC AGE,"who knows early national poetry, early uncritical art of any kind,"
325,THE HOMERIC AGE,this theory seems not easily tenable. The difficulty of the theory is
326,THE HOMERIC AGE,"increased, if we suppose that the Achaeans were the recent conquerors"
327,THE HOMERIC AGE,"of the Mycenaeans. Whether we regard the Achaeans as ""Celts,"" with Mr."
328,THE HOMERIC AGE,"Ridgeway, victors over an Aryan people, the Pelasgic Mycenaeans; or"
329,THE HOMERIC AGE,"whether, with Mr. Hall, we think that the Achaeans were the Aryan"
330,THE HOMERIC AGE,"conquerors of a non-Aryan people, the makers of the Mycenaean"
331,THE HOMERIC AGE,"civilisation; in the stress of a conquest, followed at no long interval"
332,THE HOMERIC AGE,"by an expulsion at the hands of Dorian invaders, there would be little"
333,THE HOMERIC AGE,thought of archaising among Achaean poets. [Footnote: Mr. Hall informs
334,THE HOMERIC AGE,me that he no longer holds the opinion that the poets archaised.]
335,THE HOMERIC AGE,
336,THE HOMERIC AGE,"A distinction has been made, it is true, between the poet and other"
337,THE HOMERIC AGE,"artists in this respect. Monsieur Perrot says, ""The vase-painter"
338,THE HOMERIC AGE,reproduces what he sees; while the epic poets endeavoured to represent
339,THE HOMERIC AGE,a distant past. If Homer gives swords of bronze to his heroes of times
340,THE HOMERIC AGE,"gone by, it is because he knows that such were the weapons of these"
341,THE HOMERIC AGE,"heroes of long ago. In arming them with bronze he makes use, in his"
342,THE HOMERIC AGE,"way, of what we call 'local colour....' Thus the Homeric poet is a more"
343,THE HOMERIC AGE,"conscientious historian than Virgil!"" [Footnote: La _Grète de l'Epopée_,"
344,THE HOMERIC AGE,"Perrot et Chipiez, p. 230.]"
345,THE HOMERIC AGE,
346,THE HOMERIC AGE,Now we contend that old uncritical poets no more sought for antique
347,THE HOMERIC AGE,"""local colour"" than any other artists did. M. Perrot himself says with"
348,THE HOMERIC AGE,"truth, ""the _CHANSON DE ROLAND_, and all the _Gestes_ of the same cycle"
349,THE HOMERIC AGE,"explain for us the Iliad and the Odyssey."" [Footnote: op. cit., p. 5.]"
350,THE HOMERIC AGE,But the poet of the _CHANSON DE ROLAND_ accoutres his heroes of old time
351,THE HOMERIC AGE,"in the costume and armour of his own age, and the later poets of the"
352,THE HOMERIC AGE,same cycle introduce the innovations of their time; they do not hunt for
353,THE HOMERIC AGE,"""local colour"" in the _CHANSON DE ROLAND_. The very words ""local colour"""
354,THE HOMERIC AGE,are a modern phrase for an idea that never occurred to the artists of
355,THE HOMERIC AGE,"ancient uncritical ages. The Homeric poets, like the painters of the"
356,THE HOMERIC AGE,"Dipylon period, describe the details of life as they see them with their"
357,THE HOMERIC AGE,"own eyes. Such poets and artists never have the fear of ""anachronisms"""
358,THE HOMERIC AGE,"before them. This, indeed, is plain to the critics themselves, for"
359,THE HOMERIC AGE,"they, detect anachronisms as to land tenure, burial, the construction"
360,THE HOMERIC AGE,"of houses, marriage customs, weapons, and armour in the _Iliad_ and"
361,THE HOMERIC AGE,_Odyssey_. These supposed anachronisms we examine later: if they really
362,THE HOMERIC AGE,exist they show that the poets were indifferent to local colour
363,THE HOMERIC AGE,"and archaeological precision, or were incapable of attaining to"
364,THE HOMERIC AGE,"archaeological accuracy. In fact, such artistic revival of the past in"
365,THE HOMERIC AGE,its habit as it lived is a purely modern ideal.
366,THE HOMERIC AGE,
367,THE HOMERIC AGE,"We are to show, then, that the Epics, being, as wholes, free from such"
368,THE HOMERIC AGE,inevitable modifications in the picture of changing details of life as
369,THE HOMERIC AGE,"uncritical authors always introduce, are the work of the one age which"
370,THE HOMERIC AGE,"they represent. This is the reverse of what has long been, and still is,"
371,THE HOMERIC AGE,"the current theory of Homeric criticism, according to which the Homeric"
372,THE HOMERIC AGE,"poems are, and bear manifest marks of being, a mosaic of the poetry of"
373,THE HOMERIC AGE,several ages of change.
374,THE HOMERIC AGE,
375,THE HOMERIC AGE,Till Wolf published his _Prolegomena_ to [blank space] (1795) there was
376,THE HOMERIC AGE,"little opposition to the old belief that the _ILIAD_ and Odyssey were,"
377,THE HOMERIC AGE,"allowing for interpolations, the work of one, or at most of two, poets."
378,THE HOMERIC AGE,"After the appearance of Wolfs celebrated book, Homeric critics have"
379,THE HOMERIC AGE,"maintained, generally speaking, that the _ILIAD_ is either a collection"
380,THE HOMERIC AGE,"of short lays disposed in sequence in a late age, or that it contains an"
381,THE HOMERIC AGE,"ancient original ""kernel"" round which ""expansions,"" made throughout"
382,THE HOMERIC AGE,"some centuries of changeful life, have accrued, and have been at last"
383,THE HOMERIC AGE,arranged by a literary redactor or editor.
384,THE HOMERIC AGE,
385,THE HOMERIC AGE,The latter theory is now dominant. It is maintained that the _Iliad_ is
386,THE HOMERIC AGE,a work of at least four centuries. Some of the objections to this theory
387,THE HOMERIC AGE,were obvious to Wolf himself--more obvious to him than to his followers.
388,THE HOMERIC AGE,"He was aware, and some of them are not, of the distinction between"
389,THE HOMERIC AGE,"reading the _ILIAD_ as all poetic literature is naturally read, and by"
390,THE HOMERIC AGE,"all authors is meant to be read, for human pleasure, and studying it in"
391,THE HOMERIC AGE,"the spirit of ""the analytical reader."" As often as he read for pleasure,"
392,THE HOMERIC AGE,"he says, disregarding the purely fanciful ""historical conditions"" which"
393,THE HOMERIC AGE,he invented for Homer; as often as he yielded himself to that running
394,THE HOMERIC AGE,stream of action and narration; as often as he considered the _harmony_
395,THE HOMERIC AGE,"of _colour_ and of characters in the Epic, no man could be more angry"
396,THE HOMERIC AGE,with his own destructive criticism than himself. Wolf ceased to be a
397,THE HOMERIC AGE,Wolfian whenever he placed himself at the point of view of the reader or
398,THE HOMERIC AGE,"the listener, to whom alone every poet makes his appeal."
399,THE HOMERIC AGE,
400,THE HOMERIC AGE,"But he deemed it his duty to place himself at another point of view,"
401,THE HOMERIC AGE,"that of the scientific literary historian, the historian of a period"
402,THE HOMERIC AGE,"concerning whose history he could know nothing. ""How could the thing"
403,THE HOMERIC AGE,"be possible?"" he asked himself. ""How could a long poem like the _Iliad_"
404,THE HOMERIC AGE,"come into existence in the historical circumstances?"" [Footnote, exact"
405,THE HOMERIC AGE,"place in paragraph unknown: Preface to Homer, p, xxii., 1794.]. Wolf was"
406,THE HOMERIC AGE,unaware that he did not know what the historical circumstances were. We
407,THE HOMERIC AGE,"know how little we know, but we do know more than Wolf. He invented the"
408,THE HOMERIC AGE,"historical circumstances of the supposed poet. They were, he said, like"
409,THE HOMERIC AGE,"those of a man who should build a large ship in an inland place, with no"
410,THE HOMERIC AGE,sea to launch it upon. The _Iliad_ was the large ship; the sea was the
411,THE HOMERIC AGE,"public. Homer could have no _readers_, Wolf said, in an age that, like"
412,THE HOMERIC AGE,"the old hermit of Prague, ""never saw pen and ink,"" had no knowledge"
413,THE HOMERIC AGE,"of letters; or, if letters were dimly known, had never applied them"
414,THE HOMERIC AGE,to literature. In such circumstances no man could have a motive for
415,THE HOMERIC AGE,"composing a long poem. [Footnote: _Prolegomena to the Iliad_, p. xxvi.]"
416,THE HOMERIC AGE,
417,THE HOMERIC AGE,"Yet if the original poet, ""Homer,"" could make ""the greater part of the"
418,THE HOMERIC AGE,"songs,"" as Wolf admitted, what physical impossibility stood in the way"
419,THE HOMERIC AGE,"of his making the whole? Meanwhile, the historical circumstances, as"
420,THE HOMERIC AGE,"conceived of by Wolf, were imaginary. He did not take the circumstances"
421,THE HOMERIC AGE,of the poet as described in the Odyssey. Here a king or prince has a
422,THE HOMERIC AGE,"minstrel, honoured as were the minstrels described in the ancient Irish"
423,THE HOMERIC AGE,books of law. His duty is to entertain the prince and his family and
424,THE HOMERIC AGE,"guests by singing epic chants after supper, and there is no reason why"
425,THE HOMERIC AGE,"his poetic narratives should be brief, but rather he has an opportunity"
426,THE HOMERIC AGE,that never occurred again till the literary age of Greece for producing
427,THE HOMERIC AGE,"a long poem, continued from night to night. In the later age, in the"
428,THE HOMERIC AGE,"Asiatic colonies and in Greece, the rhapsodists, competing for prizes at"
429,THE HOMERIC AGE,"feasts, or reciting to a civic crowd, were limited in time and gave but"
430,THE HOMERIC AGE,snatches of poetry. It is in this later civic age that a poet without
431,THE HOMERIC AGE,"readers would have little motive for building Wolfs great ship of song,"
432,THE HOMERIC AGE,and scant chance of launching it to any profitable purpose. To this
433,THE HOMERIC AGE,"point we return; but when once critics, following Wolf, had convinced"
434,THE HOMERIC AGE,"themselves that a long early poem was impossible, they soon found"
435,THE HOMERIC AGE,abundant evidence that it had never existed.
436,THE HOMERIC AGE,
437,THE HOMERIC AGE,"They have discovered discrepancies of which, they say, no one sane poet"
438,THE HOMERIC AGE,could have been guilty. They have also discovered that the poems had
439,THE HOMERIC AGE,"not, as Wolf declared, ""one 'harmony of colour"" (_unus color_). Each"
440,THE HOMERIC AGE,"age, they say, during which the poems were continued, lent its own"
441,THE HOMERIC AGE,"colour. The poets, by their theory, now preserved the genuine tradition"
442,THE HOMERIC AGE,"of things old; cremation, cairn and urn burial; the use of the chariot"
443,THE HOMERIC AGE,in war; the use of bronze for weapons; a peculiar stage of customary
444,THE HOMERIC AGE,law; a peculiar form of semi-feudal society; a peculiar kind of house.
445,THE HOMERIC AGE,"But again, by a change in the theory, the poets introduced later"
446,THE HOMERIC AGE,novelties; later forms of defensive armour; later modes of burial; later
447,THE HOMERIC AGE,religious and speculative beliefs; a later style of house; an advanced
448,THE HOMERIC AGE,stage of law; modernisms in grammar and language.
449,THE HOMERIC AGE,
450,THE HOMERIC AGE,The usual position of critics in this matter is stated by Helbig; and
451,THE HOMERIC AGE,we are to contend that the theory is contradicted by all experience of
452,THE HOMERIC AGE,"ancient literatures, and is in itself the reverse of consistent. ""The"
453,THE HOMERIC AGE,"_artists_ of antiquity,"" says Helbig, with perfect truth, ""had no idea"
454,THE HOMERIC AGE,of archaeological studies.... They represented legendary scenes in
455,THE HOMERIC AGE,"conformity with the spirit of their own age, and reproduced the arms and"
456,THE HOMERIC AGE,"implements and costume that they saw around them."" [Footnote: _L'Épopée"
457,THE HOMERIC AGE,"Homerique_, p. 5; _Homerische Epos_, p. 4.]"
458,THE HOMERIC AGE,
459,THE HOMERIC AGE,"Now a poet is an _artist_, like another, and he, too--no less than the"
460,THE HOMERIC AGE,"vase painter or engraver of gems--in dealing with legends of times past,"
461,THE HOMERIC AGE,"represents (in an uncritical age) the arms, utensils, costume, and the"
462,THE HOMERIC AGE,"religious, geographical, legal, social, and political ideas of his own"
463,THE HOMERIC AGE,period. We shall later prove that this is true by examples from the
464,THE HOMERIC AGE,early mediaeval epic poetry of Europe.
465,THE HOMERIC AGE,
466,THE HOMERIC AGE,It follows that if the _Iliad_ is absolutely consistent and harmonious
467,THE HOMERIC AGE,"in its picture of life, and of all the accessories of life, the _Iliad_"
468,THE HOMERIC AGE,"is the work of a single age, of a single stage of culture, the poet"
469,THE HOMERIC AGE,"describing his own environment. But Helbig, on the other hand, citing"
470,THE HOMERIC AGE,"Wilamowitz Moellendorff, declares that the _Iliad_--the work of four"
471,THE HOMERIC AGE,"centuries, he says--maintains its unity of colour by virtue of"
472,THE HOMERIC AGE,an uninterrupted poetical tradition. [Footnote: _Homerische
473,THE HOMERIC AGE,"Untersuchungen_, p. 292; _Homerische Epos_, p. I.] If so, the poets must"
474,THE HOMERIC AGE,"have archaeologised, must have kept asking themselves, ""Is this or that"
475,THE HOMERIC AGE,"detail true to the past?"" which artists in uncritical ages never do,"
476,THE HOMERIC AGE,as we have been told by Helbig. They must have carefully pondered the
477,THE HOMERIC AGE,"surviving old Achaean lays, which ""were born when the heroes could"
478,THE HOMERIC AGE,"not read, or boil flesh, or back a steed."" By carefully observing the"
479,THE HOMERIC AGE,"earliest lays the late poets, in times of changed manners, ""could avoid"
480,THE HOMERIC AGE,"anachronisms by the aid of tradition, which gave them a very exact idea"
481,THE HOMERIC AGE,"of the epic heroes."" Such is the opinion of Wilamowitz Moellendorff. He"
482,THE HOMERIC AGE,appears to regard the tradition as keeping the later poets in the old
483,THE HOMERIC AGE,"way automatically, not consciously, but this, we also learn from Helbig,"
484,THE HOMERIC AGE,"did not occur. The poets often wandered from the way. [Footnote: Helbig,"
485,THE HOMERIC AGE,"_Homerische Epos,_ pp. 2, 3.] Thus old Mycenaean lays, if any existed,"
486,THE HOMERIC AGE,would describe the old Mycenaean mode of burial. The Homeric poet
487,THE HOMERIC AGE,describes something radically different. We vainly ask for proof that
488,THE HOMERIC AGE,in any early national literature known to us poets have been true to the
489,THE HOMERIC AGE,"colour and manners of the remote times in which their heroes moved,"
490,THE HOMERIC AGE,and of which old minstrels sang. The thing is without example: of this
491,THE HOMERIC AGE,proofs shall be offered in abundance.
492,THE HOMERIC AGE,
493,THE HOMERIC AGE,"Meanwhile, the whole theory which regards the _Iliad_ as the work of"
494,THE HOMERIC AGE,four or five centuries rests on the postulate that poets throughout
495,THE HOMERIC AGE,"these centuries did what such poets never do, kept true to the details"
496,THE HOMERIC AGE,"of a life remote from their own, and also did not."
497,THE HOMERIC AGE,
498,THE HOMERIC AGE,"For Helbig does not, after all, cleave to his opinion. On the other"
499,THE HOMERIC AGE,"hand, he says that the later poets of the _Iliad_ did not cling to"
500,THE HOMERIC AGE,"tradition. ""They allowed themselves to be influenced by their own"
501,THE HOMERIC AGE,environment: _this influence betrays ITSELF IN THE descriptions of
502,THE HOMERIC AGE,"DETAILS_.... The rhapsodists,"" (reciters, supposed to have altered the"
503,THE HOMERIC AGE,"poems at will), ""did not fail to interpolate relatively recent elements"
504,THE HOMERIC AGE,"into the oldest parts of the Epic."" [Footnote: _Homerische Epos,_ p. 2.]"
505,THE HOMERIC AGE,
506,THE HOMERIC AGE,At this point comes in a complex inconsistency. The Tenth Book of the
507,THE HOMERIC AGE,"_Iliad_, thinks Helbig--in common with almost all critics--""is one of"
508,THE HOMERIC AGE,"the most recent lays of the _Iliad_."" But in this recent lay (say of"
509,THE HOMERIC AGE,the eighth or seventh century) the poet describes the Thracians as on
510,THE HOMERIC AGE,"a level of civilisation with the Achaeans, and, indeed, as even more"
511,THE HOMERIC AGE,"luxurious, wealthy, and refined in the matter of good horses, glorious"
512,THE HOMERIC AGE,"armour, and splendid chariots. But, by the time of the Persian"
513,THE HOMERIC AGE,"wars, says Helbig, the Thracians were regarded by the Greeks as rude"
514,THE HOMERIC AGE,"barbarians, and their military equipment was totally un-Greek. They did"
515,THE HOMERIC AGE,"not wear helmets, but caps of fox-skin. They had no body armour; their"
516,THE HOMERIC AGE,shields were small round bucklers; their weapons were bows and daggers.
517,THE HOMERIC AGE,"These customs could not, at the time of the Persian wars, be recent"
518,THE HOMERIC AGE,"innovations in Thrace. [Footnote: Herodotus, vii. 75.]"
519,THE HOMERIC AGE,
520,THE HOMERIC AGE,"Had the poet of _ILIAD_, Book X., known the Thracians in _this_"
521,THE HOMERIC AGE,"condition, says Helbig, as he was fond of details of costume and arms,"
522,THE HOMERIC AGE,"he would have certainly described their fox-skin caps, bows, bucklers,"
523,THE HOMERIC AGE,"and so forth. He would not here have followed the Epic tradition, which"
524,THE HOMERIC AGE,represented the Thracians as makers of great swords and as splendidly
525,THE HOMERIC AGE,"armed charioteers. His audience had met the Thracians in peace and war,"
526,THE HOMERIC AGE,and would contradict the poet's description of them as heavily armed
527,THE HOMERIC AGE,"charioteers. It follows, therefore, that the latest poets, such as the"
528,THE HOMERIC AGE,"author of Book X., did not introduce recent details, those of their"
529,THE HOMERIC AGE,"own time, but we have just previously been told that to do so was their"
530,THE HOMERIC AGE,custom in the description of details.
531,THE HOMERIC AGE,
532,THE HOMERIC AGE,"Now Studniczka [Footnote: _Homerische Epos, pp. 7-11, cf._ Note I;"
533,THE HOMERIC AGE,"_Zeitschrift fur die Oestern Gymnasien_, 1886, p. 195.] explains the"
534,THE HOMERIC AGE,"picture of the Thracians in _Iliad_, Book X., on Helbig's _other_"
535,THE HOMERIC AGE,"principle, namely, that the very late author of the Tenth Book merely"
536,THE HOMERIC AGE,"conforms to the conventional tradition of the Epic, adheres to the model"
537,THE HOMERIC AGE,"set in ancient Achaean, or rather ancient Ionian times, and scrupulously"
538,THE HOMERIC AGE,"preserved by the latest poets--that is, when the latest poets do not"
539,THE HOMERIC AGE,bring in the new details of their own age. But Helbig will not accept
540,THE HOMERIC AGE,"his own theory in this case, whence does it follow that the author of"
541,THE HOMERIC AGE,"the Tenth Book must, in his opinion, have lived in Achaean times, and"
542,THE HOMERIC AGE,"described the Thracians as they then were, charioteers, heavily armed,"
543,THE HOMERIC AGE,"not light-clad archers? If this is so, we ask how Helbig can aver that"
544,THE HOMERIC AGE,the Tenth Book is one of the latest parts of the _Iliad?_
545,THE HOMERIC AGE,
546,THE HOMERIC AGE,In studying the critics who hold that the _Iliad_ is the growth of
547,THE HOMERIC AGE,four centuries--say from the eleventh to the seventh century B.C.--no
548,THE HOMERIC AGE,consistency is to be discovered; the earth is never solid beneath our
549,THE HOMERIC AGE,feet. We find now that the poets are true to tradition in the details of
550,THE HOMERIC AGE,ancient life--now that the poets introduce whatever modern details they
551,THE HOMERIC AGE,"please. The late poets have now a very exact knowledge of the past; now,"
552,THE HOMERIC AGE,"the late poets know nothing about the past, or, again, some of the poets"
553,THE HOMERIC AGE,are fond of actual and very minute archaeological research! The theory
554,THE HOMERIC AGE,shifts its position as may suit the point to be made at the moment by
555,THE HOMERIC AGE,"the critic. All is arbitrary, and it is certain that logic demands a"
556,THE HOMERIC AGE,very different method of inquiry. If Helbig and other critics of his
557,THE HOMERIC AGE,way of thinking mean that in the _Iliad_ (1) there are parts of genuine
558,THE HOMERIC AGE,"antiquity; other parts (2) by poets who, with stern accuracy, copied the"
559,THE HOMERIC AGE,old modes; other parts (3) by poets who tried to copy but failed; with
560,THE HOMERIC AGE,passages (4) by poets who deliberately innovated; and passages (5)
561,THE HOMERIC AGE,"by poets who drew fanciful pictures of the past ""from their inner"
562,THE HOMERIC AGE,"consciousness,"" while, finally (6), some poets made minute antiquarian"
563,THE HOMERIC AGE,researches; and if the argument be that the critics can detect these six
564,THE HOMERIC AGE,"elements, then we are asked to repose unlimited confidence in critical"
565,THE HOMERIC AGE,powers of discrimination. The critical standard becomes arbitrary and
566,THE HOMERIC AGE,subjective.
567,THE HOMERIC AGE,
568,THE HOMERIC AGE,"It is our effort, then, in the following pages to show that the _unus_"
569,THE HOMERIC AGE,"color of Wolf does pervade the Epics, that recent details are not often,"
570,THE HOMERIC AGE,"if ever, interpolated, that the poems harmoniously represent one"
571,THE HOMERIC AGE,"age, and that a brief age, of culture; that this effect cannot, in"
572,THE HOMERIC AGE,"a thoroughly uncritical period, have been deliberately aimed at and"
573,THE HOMERIC AGE,"produced by archaeological learning, or by sedulous copying of poetic"
574,THE HOMERIC AGE,"tradition, or by the scientific labours of an editor of the sixth"
575,THE HOMERIC AGE,"century B.C. We shall endeavour to prove, what we have already"
576,THE HOMERIC AGE,"indicated, that the hypotheses of expansion are not self-consistent,"
577,THE HOMERIC AGE,or in accordance with what is known of the evolution of early national
578,THE HOMERIC AGE,"poetry. The strongest part, perhaps, of our argument is to rest on our"
579,THE HOMERIC AGE,"interpretation of archaeological evidence, though we shall not"
580,THE HOMERIC AGE,neglect the more disputable or less convincing contentions of literary
581,THE HOMERIC AGE,criticism.

590,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,
591,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,A theorist who believes that the Homeric poems are the growth of four
592,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"changeful centuries, must present a definite working hypothesis as to"
593,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,how they escaped from certain influences of the late age in which much
594,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,of them is said to have been composed. We must first ask to what manner
595,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"of audiences did the poets sing, in the alleged four centuries of the"
596,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"evolution of the Epics. Mr. Leaf, as a champion of the theory of ages"
597,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"of ""expansion,"" answers that ""the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ are essentially,"
598,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"and above all, Court poems. They were composed to be sung in the palaces"
599,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"of a ruling aristocracy ... the poems are aristocratic and courtly, not"
600,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"popular."" [Footnote: Companion to the _Iliad_, pp. 2,8. 1892.] They are"
601,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"not _Volkspoesie_; they are not ballads. ""It is now generally recognised"
602,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"that this conception is radically false."""
603,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,
604,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"These opinions, in which we heartily agree--there never was such a"
605,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"thing as a ""popular"" Epic--were published fourteen years ago. Mr."
606,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"Leaf, however, would not express them with regard to ""our"" _Iliad_ and"
607,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"Odyssey, because, in his view, a considerable part of the _Iliad_, as"
608,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"it stands, was made, not by Court bards in the Achaean courts of Europe,"
609,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"not for an audience of noble warriors and dames, but by wandering"
610,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,minstrels in the later Ionian colonies of Asia. They did not chant for a
611,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"military aristocracy, but for the enjoyment of town and country folk at"
612,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"popular festivals. [Footnote: Iliad, vol. i. p. xvi. 1900.] The poems"
613,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"were _begun_, indeed, he thinks, for ""a wealthy aristocracy living"
614,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"on the product of their lands,"" in European Greece; were begun by"
615,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"contemporary court minstrels, but were continued, vastly expanded, and"
616,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"altered to taste by wandering singers and reciting rhapsodists, who"
617,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"amused the holidays of a commercial, expansive, and bustling Ionian"
618,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"democracy. [Footnote: _Companion to the Iliad_, p. II.]"
619,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,
620,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"We must suppose that, on this theory, the later poets pleased a"
621,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,commercial democracy by keeping up the tone that had delighted an old
622,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"land-owning military aristocracy. It is not difficult, however, to admit"
623,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"this as possible, for the poems continued to be admired in all ages of"
624,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"Greece and under every form of society. The real question is, would the"
625,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,modern poets be the men to keep up a tone some four or five centuries
626,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"old, and to be true, if they were true, to the details of the heroic"
627,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"age? ""It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that some part of the"
628,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,most primitive _Iliad_ may have been actually sung by the court minstrel
629,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"in the palace whose ruins can still be seen in Mycenae."" [Footnote:"
630,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"Leaf, _Iliad_, vol. i. p. xv.] But, by the expansionist theory, even"
631,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,the oldest parts of our _Iliad_ are now full of what we may call quite
632,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"recent Ionian additions, full of late retouches, and full, so to speak,"
633,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,of omissions of old parts.
634,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,
635,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"Through four or five centuries, by the hypothesis, every singer who"
636,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,could find an audience was treating as much as he knew of a vast body of
637,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"ancient lays exactly as he pleased, adding here, lopping there, altering"
638,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"everywhere. Moreover, these were centuries full of change. The ancient"
639,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,Achaean palaces were becoming the ruins which we still behold. The
640,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"old art had faded, and then fallen under the disaster of the Dorian"
641,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"conquest. A new art, or a recrudescence of earlier art, very crude and"
642,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"barbaric, had succeeded, and was beginning to acquire form and vitality."
643,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,The very scene of life was altered: the new singers and listeners dwelt
644,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"on the Eastern side of the Aegean. Knights no longer, as in Europe,"
645,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"fought from chariots: war was conducted by infantry, for the most part,"
646,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,with mounted auxiliaries. With the disappearance of the war chariot the
647,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,huge Mycenaean shields had vanished or were very rarely used. The early
648,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"vase painters do not, to my knowledge, represent heroes as fighting from"
649,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,war chariots. They had lost touch with that method. Fighting men now
650,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"carried relatively small round bucklers, and iron was the metal chiefly"
651,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"employed for swords, spears, and arrow points. Would the new poets,"
652,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"in deference to tradition, abstain from mentioning cavalry, or small"
653,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"bucklers, or iron swords and spears? or would they avoid puzzling their"
654,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,hearers by speaking of obsolete and unfamiliar forms of tactics and of
655,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,military equipment? Would they therefore sing of things familiar--of
656,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"iron weapons, small round shields, hoplites, and cavalry? We shall see"
657,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,that confused and self-contradictory answers are given by criticism
658,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,to all these questions by scholars who hold that the Epics are not the
659,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"product of one, but of many ages."
660,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,
661,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,There were other changes between the ages of the original minstrel and
662,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,of the late successors who are said to have busied themselves in adding
663,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"to, mutilating, and altering his old poem. Kings and courts had passed"
664,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"away; old Ionian myths and religious usages, unknown to the Homeric"
665,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"poets, had come out into the light; commerce and pleasure and early"
666,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,philosophies were the chief concerns of life. Yet the poems continued to
667,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"be aristocratic in manners; and, in religion and ritual, to be pure from"
668,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"recrudescences of savage poetry and superstition, though the Ionians"
669,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"""did not drop the more primitive phases of belief which had clung to"
670,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,them; these rose to the surface with the rest of the marvellous Ionic
671,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"genius, and many an ancient survival was enshrined in the literature"
672,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,or mythology of Athens which had long passed out of all remembrance at
673,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"Mycenas."" [Footnote: _Companion to the Iliad_, p. 7.]"
674,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,
675,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"Amazing to say, none of these ""more primitive phases of belief,"" none"
676,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"of the recrudescent savage magic, was intruded by the late Ionian poets"
677,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"into the Iliad which they continued, by the theory. Such phases of"
678,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"belief were, indeed, by their time popular, and frequently appeared in"
679,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"the Cyclic poems on the Trojan war; continuations of the _ILIAD_, which"
680,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,were composed by Ionian authors at the same time as much of the _ILIAD_
681,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,itself (by the theory) was composed. The authors of these Cyclic
682,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,poems--authors contemporary with the makers of much of the
683,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"_ILIAD_--_were_ eminently ""un-Homeric"" in many respects. [Footnote:"
684,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"_Cf_. Monro, _The Cyclic Poets; Odyssey_, vol. ii, pp. 342-384.] They"
685,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,had ideas very different from those of the authors of the _Iliad_ and
686,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"_ODYSSEY_, as these ideas have reached us."
687,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,
688,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"Helbig states this curious fact, that the Homeric poems are free from"
689,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,many recent or recrudescent ideas common in other Epics composed during
690,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,the later centuries of the supposed four hundred years of Epic growth.
691,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"[Footnote: _Homerische Epos_, p. 3.] Thus a signet ring was mentioned"
692,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"in the _Ilias Puma_, and there are no rings in _Iliad_ or _Odyssey_."
693,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,But Helbig does not perceive the insuperable difficulty which here
694,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"encounters his hypothesis. He remarks: ""In certain poems which were"
695,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"grouping themselves around the _Iliad and _Odyssey, we meet data"
696,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"absolutely opposed to the conventional style of the Epic."" He gives"
697,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,three or four examples of perfectly un-Homeric ideas occurring in Epics
698,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"of the eighth to seventh centuries, B.C., and a large supply of such"
699,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"cases can be adduced. But Helbig does not ask how it happened that, if"
700,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"poets of these centuries had lost touch with the Epic tradition, and had"
701,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"wandered into a new region of thought, as they had, examples of their"
702,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,notions do not occur in the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_. By his theory these
703,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"poems were being added to and altered, even in their oldest portions,"
704,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"at the very period when strange fresh, or old and newly revived fancies"
705,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"were flourishing. If so, how were the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_, unlike the"
706,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"Cyclic poems, kept uncontaminated, as they confessedly were, by the new"
707,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,romantic ideas?
708,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,
709,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,Here is the real difficulty. Cyclic poets of the eighth and seventh
710,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,centuries had certainly lost touch with the Epic tradition; their poems
711,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,make that an admitted fact. Yet poets of the eighth to seventh centuries
712,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"were, by the theory, busily adding to and altering the ancient lays of"
713,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"the _Iliad_. How did _they_ abstain from the new or revived ideas, and"
714,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,from the new _genre_ of romance? Are we to believe that one set of late
715,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,Ionian poets--they who added to and altered the Iliad--were true
716,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"to tradition, while another contemporary set of Ionian poets, the"
717,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,Cyclics--authors of new Epics on Homeric themes--are known to have quite
718,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"lost touch with the Homeric taste, religion, and ritual? The reply will"
719,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"perhaps be a Cyclic poet said, ""Here I am going to compose quite a new"
720,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,poem about the old heroes. I shall make them do and think and believe as
721,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"I please, without reference to the evidence of the old poems."" But, it"
722,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"will have to be added, the rhapsodists of 800-540 B.C., and the general"
723,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"editor of the latter date, thought, _we_ are continuing an old set of"
724,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"lays, and we must be very careful in adhering to manners, customs, and"
725,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"beliefs as described by our predecessors. For instance, the old heroes"
726,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"had only bronze, no iron,--and then the rhapsodists forgot, and made"
727,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"iron a common commodity in the _Iliad_. Again, the rhapsodists knew that"
728,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"the ancient heroes had no corslets--the old lays, we learn, never"
729,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,spoke of corslets--but they made them wear corslets of much splendour.
730,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,[Footnote: The reader must remember that the view of the late poets
731,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,as careful adherents of tradition in usages and ideas only obtains
732,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,_sometimes_; at others the critics declare that archaeological precision
733,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"is _not_ preserved, and that the Ionic continuators introduced, for"
734,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"example, the military gear of their own period into a poem which"
735,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,represents much older weapons and equipments.] This theory does not help
736,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,us. In an uncritical age poets could not discern that their genre of
737,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,romance and religion was alien from that of Homer.
738,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,
739,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,To return to the puzzle about the careful and precise continuators
740,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"of the _Iliad_, as contrasted with their heedless contemporaries, the"
741,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"authors of the Cyclic poems. How ""non-Homeric"" the authors of these"
742,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"Cyclic poems were, before and after 660 B.C., we illustrate from"
743,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,examples of their left hand backslidings and right hand fallings
744,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"off. They introduced (1) The Apotheosis of the Dioscuri, who in Homer"
745,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"(_Iliad_, III. 243) are merely dead men (_Cypria_). (2) Story of"
746,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"Iphigenia _Cypria_. (3) Story of Palamedes, who is killed when angling"
747,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,by Odysseus and Diomede (Cypria).
748,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,
749,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"Homer's heroes never fish, except in stress of dire necessity, in the"
750,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"Odyssey, and Homer's own Diomede and Odysseus would never stoop"
751,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,to assassinate a companion when engaged in the contemplative man's
752,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,recreation. We here see the heroes in late degraded form as on the
753,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"Attic stage. (4) The Cyclics introduce Helen as daughter of Nemesis,"
754,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"and describe the flight of Nemesis from Zeus in various animal forms,"
755,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"a Märchen of a sort not popular with Homer; an Ionic Märchen, Mr. Leaf"
756,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,would say. There is nothing like this in the Iliad and Odyssey. (5) They
757,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"call the son of Achilles, not Neoptolemus, as Homer does, but Pyrrhus."
758,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,(6) They represent the Achaean army as obtaining supplies through three
759,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"magically gifted maidens, who produce corn, wine, and oil at will, as in"
760,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,fairy tales. Another Ionic non-Achaean Märchen! They bring in ghosts of
761,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"heroes dead and buried. Such ghosts, in Homer's opinion, were impossible"
762,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"if the dead had been cremated. All these non-Homeric absurdities, save"
763,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"the last, are from the Cypria, dated by Sir Richard Jebb about 776 B.C.,"
764,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"long before the Odyssey was put into shape, namely, after 660 B. C."
765,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"in his opinion. Yet the alleged late compiler of the Odyssey, in the"
766,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"seventh century, never wanders thus from the Homeric standard in taste."
767,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,What a skilled archaeologist he must have been! The author of the Cypria
768,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"knew the Iliad, [Footnote: Monro, Odyssey, vol. ii. p. 354.] but his"
769,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,knowledge could not keep him true to tradition. (7) In the AEthiopis
770,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"(about 776 B.C.) men are made immortal after death, and are worshipped"
771,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"as heroes, an idea foreign to Iliad and Odyssey. (8) There is a savage"
772,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"ritual of purification from blood shed by a homicide (compare Eumenides,"
773,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"line 273). This is unheard of in Iliad and Odyssey, though familiar to"
774,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"Aeschylus. (9) Achilles, after death, is carried to the isle of Leuke."
775,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"(10) The fate of Ilium, in the Cyclic Little _Iliad_, hangs on the"
776,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"Palladium, of which nothing is known in _Iliad_ or _Odyssey_. The"
777,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,_Little Iliad_ is dated about 700 B.C. (11) The _Nostoi_ mentions
778,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"Molossians, not named by Homer (which is a trifle); it also mentions"
779,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"the Asiatic city of Colophon, an Ionian colony, which is not a trivial"
780,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,self-betrayal on the part of the poet. He is dated about 750 B.C.
781,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,
782,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"Thus, more than a century before the _Odyssey_ received its final form,"
783,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"after 660 B.C., from the hands of one man (according to the theory),"
784,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,the other Ionian poets who attempted Epic were betraying themselves as
785,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"non-Homeric on every hand. [Footnote: Monro, _Odyssey_, vol. ii. pp."
786,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,347-383.]
787,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,
788,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,Our examples are but a few derived from the brief notices of the Cyclic
789,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"poets' works, as mentioned in ancient literature; these poets probably,"
790,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"in fact, betrayed themselves constantly. But their contemporaries, the"
791,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"makers of late additions to the _Odyssey_, and the later mosaic worker"
792,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"who put it together, never betrayed themselves to anything like the"
793,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"fatal extent of anachronism exhibited by the Cyclic poets. How, if the"
794,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"true ancient tone, taste, manners, and religion were lost, as the"
795,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"Cyclic poets show that they were, did the contemporary Ionian poets or"
796,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,rhapsodists know and preserve the old manner?
797,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,
798,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,The best face we can put on the matter is to say that all the Cyclic
799,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"poets were recklessly independent of tradition, while all men who"
800,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"botched at the _Iliad_ were very learned, and very careful to maintain"
801,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"harmony in their pictures of life and manners, except when they"
802,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"introduced changes in burial, bride-price, houses, iron, greaves, and"
803,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"corslets, all of them things, by the theory, modern, and when they sang"
804,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,in modern grammar.
805,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,
806,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"Yet despite this conscientiousness of theirs, most of the many"
807,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"authors of our _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ were, by the theory, strolling"
808,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"irresponsible rhapsodists, like the later _jongleurs_ of the thirteenth"
809,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,and fourteenth centuries in mediaeval France. How could these strollers
810,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"keep their modern Ionian ideas, or their primitive, recrudescent phases"
811,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"of belief, out of their lays, as far as they _did_ keep them out, while"
812,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"the contemporary authors of the _Cypria_, _The Sack of Ilios_, and other"
813,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"Cyclic poets were full of new ideas, legends, and beliefs, or primitive"
814,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"notions revived, and, save when revived, quite obviously late and quite"
815,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,un-Homeric in any case?
816,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,
817,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"The difficulty is the greater if the Cyclic poems were long poems, with"
818,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,one author to each Epic. Such authors were obviously men of ambition;
819,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,they produced serious works _de longue haleine_. It is from them that
820,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,we should naturally expect conservative and studious adhesion to the
821,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,traditional models. From casual strollers like the rhapsodists and
822,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"chanters at festivals, we look for nothing of the sort. _They_ might be"
823,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"expected to introduce great feats done by sergeants and privates, so to"
824,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"speak--men of the nameless [Greek: laos], the host, the foot men--who"
825,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,in Homer are occasionally said to perish of disease or to fall under the
826,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"rain of arrows, but are never distinguished by name. The strollers, it"
827,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"might be thought, would also be the very men to introduce fairy tales,"
828,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"freaks of primitive Ionian myth, discreditable anecdotes of the princely"
829,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"heroes, and references to the Ionian colonies."
830,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,
831,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"But it is not so; the serious, laborious authors of the long Cyclic"
832,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"poems do such un-Homeric things as these; the gay, irresponsible"
833,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,strolling singers of a lay here and a lay there--lays now incorporated
834,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,in the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_--scrupulously avoid such faults. They never
835,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,even introduce a signet ring. These are difficulties in the theory of
836,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"the _Iliad_ as a patchwork by many hands, in many ages, which nobody"
837,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"explains; which, indeed, nobody seems to find difficult. Yet the"
838,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,difficulty is insuperable. Even if we take refuge with Wilamowitz in the
839,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,idea that the Cyclic and Homeric poems were at first mere protoplasm
840,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"of lays of many ages, and that they were all compiled, say in the sixth"
841,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"century, into so many narratives, we come no nearer to explaining"
842,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"why the tone, taste, and ideas of two such narratives--Illiad and"
843,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"Odyssey--are confessedly distinct from the tone, taste, and ideas of all"
844,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,the others. The Cyclic poems are certainly the production of a late and
845,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"changed age? [Footnote: For what manner of audience, if not for readers,"
846,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,the Cyclic poems were composed is a mysterious question.] The _Iliad_ is
847,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,not in any degree--save perhaps in a few interpolated passages--touched
848,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,by the influences of that late age. It is not a complex of the work
849,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"of four incompatible centuries, as far as this point is concerned--the"
850,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,"point of legend, religion, ritual, and conception of heroic character."

860,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,Whosoever holds that the Homeric poems were evolved out of the lays of
861,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"many men, in many places, during many periods of culture, must present a"
862,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,consistent and logical hypothesis as to how they attained their present
863,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"plots and forms. These could not come by accident, even if the plots"
864,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"are not good--as all the world held that they were, till after Wolf's"
865,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"day--but very bad, as some critics now assert. Still plot and form,"
866,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"beyond the power of chance to produce, the poems do possess. Nobody goes"
867,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,so far as to deny that; and critics make hypotheses explanatory of
868,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"the fact that a single ancient ""kernel"" of some 2500 lines, a ""kernel"""
869,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"altered at will by any one who pleased during four centuries, became a"
870,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"constructive whole. If the hypotheses fail to account for the fact, we"
871,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"have the more reason to believe that the poems are the work of one age,"
872,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"and, mainly, of one man."

874,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"In criticising Homeric criticism as it is to-day, we cannot do better"

880,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"they certainly deserve to be, on the shelves of every Homeric student,"
881,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"old or young, and doubtless their contents reach the higher forms in"
882,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"schools, though there is reason to suppose that, about the unity of"
883,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Homer, schoolboys remain conservative."
884,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
885,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,In this book of more than 1200 pages Mr. Leaf's space is mainly
886,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"devoted to textual criticism, philology, and pure scholarship, but his"
887,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Introductions, Notes, and Appendices also set forth his mature ideas"
888,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,about the Homeric problem in general. He has altered some of his
889,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"opinions since the publication of his _Companion to the Iliad_(1892),"
890,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"but the main lines of his old system are, except on one crucial point,"
891,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,unchanged. His theory we shall try to state and criticise; in general
892,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"outline it is the current theory of separatist critics, and it may"
893,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,fairly be treated as a good example of such theories.
894,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
895,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"The system is to the following effect: Greek tradition, in the classical"
896,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"period, regarded the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ as the work of one man,"
897,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Homer, a native of one or other of the Ionian colonies of Asia Minor."
898,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,But the poems show few obvious signs of origin in Asia. They deal with
899,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"dwellers, before the Dorian invasion (which the poet never alludes to),"
900,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,on the continent of Europe and in Crete. [Footnote: If the poet sang
901,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,after the tempest of war that came down with the Dorians from the
902,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"north, he would probably have sought a topic in the Achaean exploits and"
903,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"sorrows of that period. The Dorians, not the Trojans, would have been"
904,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the foes. The epics of France of the eleventh and twelfth centuries
905,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"dwell, not on the real victories of the remote Charlemagne so much as"
906,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"on the disasters of Aliscans and Roncesvaux--defeats at Saracen hands,"
907,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Saracens being the enemies of the twelfth-century poets. No Saracens,"
908,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"in fact, fought at Roncesvaux.] The lays are concerned with ""good old"
909,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"times""; presumably between 1500 and 1100 B.C. Their pictures of the"
910,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,details of life harmonise more with what we know of the society of that
911,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"period from the evidence of buildings and recent excavations, than with"
912,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,what we know of the life and the much more rude and barbaric art of the
913,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"so-called ""Dipylon"" period of ""geometrical"" ornament considerably later."
914,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"In the Dipylon age though the use of iron, even for swords (made on the"
915,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"lines of the old bronze sword), was familiar, art was on a most barbaric"
916,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"level, not much above the Bed Indian type, as far, at least, as painted"
917,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,vases bear witness. The human figure is designed as in Tommy Traddles's
918,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"skeletons; there is, however, some crude but promising idea of"
919,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,composition.
920,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
921,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"The picture of life in the Homeric poems, then, is more like that of,"
922,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"say, 1500-1100 B.C. than of, say, 1000-850 B.C. in Mr. Leaf's opinion."
923,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Certainly Homer describes a wealthy aristocracy, subject to an"
924,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Over-Lord, who rules, by right divine, from ""golden Mycenae."" We hear of"
925,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,no such potentate in Ionia. Homer's accounts of contemporary art seem to
926,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,be inspired by the rich art generally dated about 1500-1200. Yet there
927,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"are ""many traces of apparent anachronism,"" of divergence from the more"
928,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,antique picture of life. In these divergences are we to recognise the
929,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,picture of a later development of the ancient existence of 1500-1200
930,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"B.C.? Or have elements of the life of a much later age of Greece (say,"
931,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,800-550 B.C.) been consciously or unconsciously introduced by the late
932,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"poets? Here Mr. Leaf recognises a point on which we have insisted,"
933,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"and must keep insisting, for it is of the first importance. ""It is _a"
934,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"priori_ the most probable"" supposition that, ""in an uncritical age,"""
935,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"poets do _not_ ""reproduce the circumstances of the old time,"" but"
936,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"""only clothe the old tale in the garb of their own days."" Poets in an"
937,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"uncritical age always, in our experience, ""clothe old tales with the"
938,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"garb of their own time,"" but Mr. Leaf thinks that, in the case of the"
939,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Homeric poems, this idea ""is not wholly borne out by the facts."""
940,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
941,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"In fact, Mr. Leaf's hypothesis, like Helbig's, exhibits a come-and-go"
942,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,between the theory that his late poets clung close to tradition and so
943,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"kept true to ancient details of life, and the theory that they did quite"
944,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the reverse in many cases. Of this frequent examples will occur. He
945,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"writes, ""The Homeric period is certainly later than the shaft tombs"""
946,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"(discovered at Mycenae by Dr. Schliemann), ""but it does not necessarily"
947,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,follow that it is post-Mycenaean. It is quite possible that certain
948,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"notable differences between the poems and the monuments"" (of Mycenae)"
949,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"""in burial, for instance, and in women's dress may be due to changes"
950,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"which arose within the Mycenaean age itself, in that later part of it"
951,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,of which our knowledge is defective--almost as defective as it is of
952,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"the subsequent 'Dipylon' period. On the whole, the resemblance to"
953,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"the typical Mycenaean culture is more striking than the difference."""
954,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"[Footnote: Leaf, Iliad, vol. i. pp. xiii.-xv. 1900.]"
955,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
956,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,So far Mr. Leaf states precisely the opinion for which we argue. The
957,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,Homeric poems describe an age later than that of the famous tombs--so
958,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"rich in relics--of the Mycenaean acropolis, and earlier than the tombs"
959,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"of the Dipylon of Athens. The poems thus spring out of an age of which,"
960,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"except from the poems themselves, we know little or nothing, because,"
961,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"as is shown later, no cairn burials answering to the frequent Homeric"
962,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,descriptions have ever been discovered--so relics corroborating Homeric
963,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,descriptions are to seek. But the age attaches itself in many ways to
964,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"the age of the Mycenaean tombs, while, in our opinion, it stands quite"
965,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,apart from the post-Dorian culture.
966,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
967,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Where we differ from Mr. Leaf is in believing that the poems, as wholes,"
968,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"were composed in that late Mycenaean period of which, from material"
969,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"remains, we know very little; that ""much new"" was not added, as he"
970,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"thinks, in ""the Ionian development"" which lasted perhaps ""from the ninth"
971,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"century B.C. to the seventh."" We cannot agree with Mr. Leaf, when he,"
972,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"like Helbig, thinks that much of the detail of the ancient life in the"
973,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"poems had early become so ""stereotyped"" that no continuator, however"
974,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"late, dared ""intentionally to sap"" the type, ""though he slipped from"
975,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"time to time into involuntary anachronism."" Some poets are also asserted"
976,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"to indulge in _voluntary_ anachronism when, as Mr. Leaf supposes, they"
977,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,equip the ancient warriors with corslets and greaves and other body
978,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"armour of bronze such as, in his opinion, the old heroes never knew,"
979,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"such as never were mentioned in the oldest parts or ""kernel"" of the"
980,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,poems. Thus the traditional details of Mycenaean life sometimes are
981,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"regarded as ""stereotyped"" in poetic tradition; sometimes as subject to"
982,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,modern alterations of a sweeping and revolutionary kind.
983,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
984,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"As to deliberate adherence to tradition by the poets, we have proved"
985,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,that the Cyclic epic poets of 800-660 B.C. wandered widely from the
986,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"ancient models. If, then, every minstrel or rhapsodist who, anywhere,"
987,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"added at will to the old ""kernel"" of the _Achilles_ was, so far as he"
988,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"was able, as conscientiously precise in his stereotyped archaeological"
989,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"details as Mr. Leaf sometimes supposes, the fact is contrary to general"
990,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,custom in such cases. When later poets in an uncritical age take up and
991,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"rehandle the poetic themes of their predecessors, they always give to"
992,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"the stories ""a new costume,"" as M. Gaston Paris remarks in reference to"
993,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,thirteenth century dealings with French epics of the eleventh century.
994,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"But, in the critics' opinion, the late rehandlers of old Achaean lays"
995,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"preserved the archaic modes of life, war, costume, weapons, and"
996,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"so forth, with conscientious care, except in certain matters to be"
997,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"considered later, when they deliberately did the very reverse. Sometimes"
998,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the late poets devoutly follow tradition. Sometimes they deliberately
999,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"innovate. Sometimes they pedantically ""archaise,"" bringing in genuine,"
1000,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"but by their time forgotten, Mycenaean things, and criticism can detect"
1001,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,their doings in each case.
1002,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1003,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Though the late continuators of the _Iliad_ were able, despite"
1004,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"certain inadvertencies, to keep up for some four centuries in Asia"
1005,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"the harmonious picture of ancient Achaean life and society in Europe,"
1006,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"critics can distinguish four separate strata, the work of many different"
1007,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"ages, in the _Iliad_. Of the first stratum composed in Europe, say about"
1008,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"1300-1150 B.C. (I give a conjectural date under all reserves), the topic"
1009,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"was _THE Wrath of ACHILLES_. Of this poem, in Mr. Leaf's opinion, (a)"
1010,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"the First Book and fifty lines of the Second Book remain intact or,"
1011,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"perhaps, are a blend of two versions. (b) The _Valour of Agamemnon_ and"
1012,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"_Defeat of THE Achaeans_. Of this there are portions in Book XI., but"
1013,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"they were meddled with, altered, and generally doctored, ""down to the"
1014,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"latest period,"" namely, the age of Pisistratus in Athens, the middle of"
1015,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"the sixth century B.C. (c) The fight in which, after their defeat, the"
1016,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Achaeans try to save the ships from the torch of Hector, and the _Valour"
1017,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"of Patroclus_ (but some critics do not accept this), with his death"
1018,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"(XV., XVI. in parts). (d) Some eighty lines on the _ARMING OF ACHILLES_"
1019,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"(XIX.). (e) Perhaps an incident or two in Books XX., XXI. (f) The"
1020,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"_Slaying HECTOR_ by Achilles, in Books XXI., XXII. (but some of the learned"
1021,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"will not admit this, and we shall, unhappily, have to prove that, if Mr."
1022,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Leaf's principles be correct, we really know nothing about the _SLAYING"
1023,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,OF HECTOR_ in its original form).
1024,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1025,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Of these six elements only did the original poem consist, Mr. Leaf"
1026,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,thinks; a rigid critic will reject as original even the _Valour of
1027,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Patroclus_ and the _DEATH OF HECTOR_, but Mr. Leaf refuses to go so far"
1028,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"as that. The original poem, as detected by him, is really ""the work of"
1029,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"a single poet, perhaps the greatest in all the world's history."" If the"
1030,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"original poet did no more than is here allotted to him, especially if he"
1031,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"left out the purpose of Zeus and the person of Thetis in Book I., we"
1032,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,do not quite understand his unapproachable greatness. He must certainly
1033,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"have drawn a rather commonplace Achilles, as we shall see, and we"
1034,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,confess to preferring the _Iliad_ as it stands.
1035,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1036,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"The brief narrative cut out of the mass by Mr. Leaf, then, was the"
1037,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"genuine old original poem or ""kernel."" What we commonly call the"
1038,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"_ILIAD_, on the other hand, is, by his theory, a thing of shreds and"
1039,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"patches, combined in a manner to be later described. The blend,"
1040,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"we learn, has none of the masterly unity of the old original poem."
1041,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Meanwhile, as criticism of literary composition is a purely literary"
1042,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"question, critics who differ from Mr. Leaf have a right to hold that"
1043,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"the _Iliad_ as it stands contains, and always did contain, a plot of"
1044,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,masterly perfection. We need not attend here so closely to Mr. Leaf's
1045,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"theory in the matter of the First Expansions, (2) and the Second"
1046,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Expansions, (3) but the latest Expansions (4) give the account of _The"
1047,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,EMBASSY_ to _Achilles_ with his refusal of _Agamemnon's APOLOGY_(Book
1048,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"IX.), the [blank space] (Book XXIV.), the _RECONCILIATION OF ACHILLES"
1049,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"AND Agamemnon, AND the FUNERAL Games_ of _Patroclus_ (XXIII.). In all"
1050,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"these parts of the poem there are, we learn, countless alterations,"
1051,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"additions, and expansions, with, last of all, many transitional"
1052,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"passages, ""the work of the editor inspired by the statesman,"" that is,"
1053,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"of an hypothetical editor who really by the theory made our _ILIAD_,"
1054,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"being employed to that end by Pistratus about 540 B.C. [Footnote: Leaf,"
1055,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"_Iliad_, vol. ii. pp. x., xiv. 1900.]."
1056,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1057,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,Mr. Leaf and critics who take his general view are enabled to detect
1058,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"the patches and tatters of many ages by various tests, for example, by"
1059,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"discovering discrepancies in the narrative, such as in their opinion"
1060,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,no one sane poet could make. Other proofs of multiplex authorship are
1061,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,discovered by the critic's private sense of what the poem ought to
1062,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"be, by his instinctive knowledge of style, by detection of the poet's"
1063,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"supposed errors in geography, by modernisms and false archaisms in words"
1064,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"and grammar, and by the presence of many objects, especially weapons and"
1065,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"armour, which the critic believes to have been unknown to the original"
1066,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,minstrel.
1067,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1068,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Thus criticism can pick out the things old, fairly old, late, and quite"
1069,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"recent, from the mass, evolved through many centuries, which is called"
1070,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the _Iliad_.
1071,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1072,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"If the existing _ILIAD_ is a mass of ""expansions,"" added at all sorts of"
1073,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"dates, in any number of places, during very different stages of culture,"
1074,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"to a single short old poem of the Mycenaean age, science needs an"
1075,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"hypothesis which will account for the _ILIAD_ ""as it stands."" Everybody"
1076,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"sees the need of the hypothesis, How was the medley of new songs by many"
1077,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,generations of irresponsible hands codified into a plot which used to
1078,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"be reckoned fine? How were the manners, customs, and characters, _unus"
1079,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"color_, preserved in a fairly coherent and uniform aspect? How was the"
1080,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"whole Greek world, throughout which all manner of discrepant versions"
1081,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"and incongruous lays must, by the theory, have been current, induced to"
1082,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"accept the version which has been bequeathed to us? Why, and for what"
1083,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"audience or what readers, did somebody, in a late age of brief lyrics"
1084,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"and of philosophic poems, take the trouble to harmonise the body of"
1085,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"discrepant wandering lays, and codify them in the _Iliad_?"
1086,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1087,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,An hypothesis which will answer all these questions is the first thing
1088,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"needful, and hypotheses are produced."
1089,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1090,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,Believers like Mr. Leaf in the development of the _Iliad_ through
1091,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"the changing revolutionary centuries, between say 1200 and 600 B.C.,"
1092,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"consciously stand in need of a working hypothesis which will account,"
1093,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"above all, for two facts: first, the relatively correct preservation of"
1094,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"the harmony of the picture of life, of ideas political and religious,"
1095,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"of the characters of the heroes, of the customary law (such as the"
1096,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"bride-price in marriage), and of the details as to weapons, implements,"
1097,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"dress, art, houses, and so forth, when these are not (according to the"
1098,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,theory) deliberately altered by late poets.
1099,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1100,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Next, the hypothesis must explain, in Mr. Leafs own words, how a single"
1101,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"version of the _Iliad_ came to be accepted, ""where many rival versions"
1102,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"must, from the necessity of the case, have once existed side by side."""
1103,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"[Footnote: _Iliad_, vol. i. p. xviii. 1900.]"
1104,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1105,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Three hypotheses have, in fact, been imagined: the first suggests the"
1106,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"preservation of the original poems in very early written texts; not,"
1107,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"of course, in ""Homer's autograph."" This view Mr. Leaf, we shall see,"
1108,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,discards. The second presents the notion of one old sacred college for
1109,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"the maintenance of poetic uniformity. Mr. Leaf rejects this theory,"
1110,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,while supposing that there were schools for professional reciters.
1111,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1112,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Last, there is the old hypothesis of Wolf: ""Pisistratus"" (about 540"
1113,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"B.C.) ""was the first who had the Homeric poems committed to writing, and"
1114,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"brought into that order in which we now possess them."""
1115,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1116,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"This hypothesis, now more than a century old, would, if it rested on"
1117,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"good evidence, explain how a single version of the various lays came to"
1118,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"be accepted and received as authorised. The Greek world, by the theory,"
1119,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,had only in various places various sets of incoherent chants _orally_
1120,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"current on the Wrath of The public was everywhere a public of listeners,"
1121,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"who heard the lays sung on rare occasions at feasts and fairs, or"
1122,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"whenever a strolling rhapsodist took up his pitch, for a day or two,"
1123,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"at a street corner. There was, by the theory, no reading public for the"
1124,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Homeric poetry. But, by the time of Pisistratus, a reading public was"
1125,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"coming into existence. The tyrant had the poems collected, edited,"
1126,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"arranged into a continuous narrative, primarily for the purpose of"
1127,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,regulating the recitals at the Panathenaic festival. When once they
1128,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"were written, copies were made, and the rest of Hellas adopted these for"
1129,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,their public purposes.
1130,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1131,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,On a small scale we have a case analogous. The old songs of Scotland
1132,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"existed, with the airs, partly in human memory, partly in scattered"
1133,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"broadsheets. The airs were good, but the words were often silly, more"
1134,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"often they were Fescennine--""more dirt than wit."" Burns rewrote the"
1135,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"words, which were published in handsome volumes, with the old airs, or"
1136,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"with these airs altered, and his became the authorised versions, while"
1137,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the ancient anonymous chants were almost entirely forgotten.
1138,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1139,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"The parallel is fairly close, but there are points of difference. Burns"
1140,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"was a great lyric poet, whereas we hear of no great epic poet in the"
1141,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,age of Pisistratus. The old words which Burns's songs superseded were
1142,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,wretched doggerel; not such were the ancient Greek heroic lays. The old
1143,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,Scottish songs had no sacred historic character; they did not contain
1144,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the history of the various towns and districts of Scotland. The heroic
1145,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"lays of Greece were believed, on the other hand, to be a kind of"
1146,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Domesday book of ancient principalities, and cities, and worshipped"
1147,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,heroes. Thus it was much easier for a great poet like Burns to supersede
1148,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"with his songs a mass of unconsidered ""sculdudery"" old lays, in which no"
1149,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"man or set of men had any interest, than for a mere editor, in the age"
1150,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"of Pisistratus, to supersede a set of lays cherished, in one shape or"
1151,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"another, by every State in Greece. This holds good, even if, prior to"
1152,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Pisistratus, there existed in Greece no written texts of Homer, and no"
1153,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"reading public, a point which we shall show reasons for declining to"
1154,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,concede.
1155,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1156,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"The theory of the edition of Pisistratus, if it rested on valid"
1157,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"evidence, would explain ""how a single version of the poems came to be"
1158,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"accepted,"" namely, because the poem was now _written_ for the first"
1159,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"time, and oral versions fell out of memory. But it would not, of course,"
1160,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"explain how, before Pisistratus, during four or five centuries of"
1161,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"change, the new poets and reciters, throughout the Greek world, each"
1162,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"adding such fresh verses as he pleased, and often introducing such"
1163,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"modern details of life as he pleased, kept up the harmony of the Homeric"
1164,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"picture of life, and character, and law, as far as it confessedly"
1165,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,exists.
1166,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1167,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,To take a single instance: the poems never allude to the personal
1168,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,armorial bearings of the heroes. They are unknown to or unnamed by
1169,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Homer, but are very familiar on the shields in seventh century and sixth"
1170,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"century vases, and AEschylus introduces them with great poetic effect"
1171,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"in [blank space]. How did late continuators, familiar with the serpents,"
1172,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"lions, bulls' heads, crabs, doves, and so forth, on the contemporary"
1173,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"shields, keep such picturesque and attractive details out of their new"
1174,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"rhapsodies? In mediaeval France, we shall show, the epics (eleventh to"
1175,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,thirteenth centuries) deal with Charlemagne and his peers of the eighth
1176,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,century A.D. But they provide these heroes with the armorial bearings
1177,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,which came in during the eleventh to twelfth century A.D. The late
1178,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,Homeric rhapsodists avoided such tempting anachronisms.
1179,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1180,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Wolf's theory, then, explains ""how a single version came to be"
1181,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"accepted."" It was the first _WRITTEN_ version; the others died out, like"
1182,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"the old Scots orally repeated songs, when Burns published new words to"
1183,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the airs. But Wolf's theory does not explain the harmony of the picture
1184,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"of life, the absence of post-Homeric ideas and ways of living, in the"
1185,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"first written version, which, practically, is our own version."
1186,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1187,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"In 1892 (_COMPANION TO THE Iliad_) Mr. Leaf adopted a different theory,"
1188,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"the hypothesis of a Homeric ""school"" ""which busied itself with the"
1189,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"tradition of the Homeric poetry,"" for there must have been some central"
1190,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,authority to preserve the text intact when it could not be preserved in
1191,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"writing. Were there no such body to maintain a fixed standard, the poems"
1192,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"must have ended by varying indefinitely, according to the caprice of"
1193,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,their various reciters. This is perfectly obvious.
1194,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1195,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,Such a school could keep an eye on anachronisms and excise them; in
1196,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"fact, the Maori priests, in an infinitely more barbarous state of"
1197,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"society, had such schools for the preservation of their ancient hymns in"
1198,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"purity. The older priests ""insisted on a critical and verbatim"
1199,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"rehearsal of all the ancient lore."" Proceedings were sanctioned by human"
1200,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,sacrifices and many mystic rites. We are not told that new poems were
1201,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,produced and criticised; it does not appear that this was the case.
1202,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Pupils attended from three to five years, and then qualified as priests"
1203,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"or _tohunga_ [Footnote: White, _THE Ancient HISTORY OF THE Maori, VOL._"
1204,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"i. pp. 8-13.]. Suppose that the Asiatic Greeks, like the Maoris and"
1205,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Zuñis, had Poetic Colleges of a sacred kind, admitting new poets, and"
1206,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,keeping them up to the antique standard in all respects. If this were
1207,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"so, the relative rarity of ""anachronisms"" and of modernisms in language"
1208,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,in the Homeric poems is explained. But Mr. Leaf has now entirely
1209,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"and with a light heart abandoned his theory of a school, which is"
1210,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"unsupported by evidence, he says.'"
1211,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1212,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"""The great problem,"" he writes, ""for those who maintain the gradual"

1217,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Mr. Leaf, in 1892, made the assumption himself: ""as some such hypothesis"
1218,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"we are bound to make in order to explain the possibility of any theory"""
1219,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"(1892). [Footnote: _COMPANION TO THE Iliad, pp. 20, 21._]"
1220,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1221,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"But now (1900) he says, after mentioning ""the assumption of a school or"
1222,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"guild of singers,"" that ""the rare mention of [Greek: Homeridai] in"
1223,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Chios gives no support to this hypothesis, which lacks any other"
1224,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"confirmation."" [Footnote: _Iliad_, vol. i. xviii. p. xix.] He therefore"
1225,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"now adopts the Wolfian hypothesis that ""an official copy of Homer was"
1226,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"made in Athens at the time of Solon or Pisistratus,"" from the rhapsodies"
1227,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"existing in the memory of reciters. [Footnote: _Iliad_, vol. i. p. xix.]"
1228,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"But Mr. Leaf had previously said [Footnote: _COMPANION TO THE Iliad_,"
1229,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"p. 190.] that ""the legend which connects his"" (Pisistratus's) ""name"
1230,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"with the Homeric poems is itself probably only conjectural, and of"
1231,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"late date."" Now the evidence for Pisistratus which, in 1892, he thought"
1232,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"""conjectural and of late date,"" seems to him a sufficient basis for an"
1233,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"hypothesis of a Pisistratean editor of the Iliad, while the evidence for"
1234,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,an Homeric school which appeared to him good enough for an hypothesis in
1235,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"1892 is rejected as worthless, though, in each case, the evidence itself"
1236,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,remains just what it used to be.
1237,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1238,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"This is not very satisfactory, and the Pisistratean hypothesis is much"
1239,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,less useful to a theorist than the former hypothesis of an Homeric
1240,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"school, for the Pisistratean hypothesis cannot explain the harmony of"
1241,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"the characters and the details in the _Iliad_, nor the absence of"
1242,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"such glaring anachronisms as the Cyclic poets made, nor the general"
1243,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"""pre-Odyssean"" character of the language and grammar. By the"
1244,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Pisistratean hypothesis there was not, what Mr. Leaf in 1892 justly"
1245,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"deemed essential, a school ""to maintain a fixed standard,"" throughout"
1246,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"the changes of four centuries, and against the caprice of many"
1247,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,generations of fresh reciters and irresponsible poets. The hypothesis of
1248,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"a school _was_ really that which, of the two, best explained the facts,"
1249,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,and there is no more valid evidence for the first making and writing
1250,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,out of our _Iliad_ under Pisistratus than for the existence of a Homeric
1251,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,school.
1252,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1253,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,The evidence for the _Iliad_ edited for Pisistratus is examined in a
1254,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,Note at the close of this chapter. Meanwhile Mr. Leaf now revives Wolf's
1255,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"old theory to account for the fact that somehow ""a single version"""
1256,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"(of the Homeric poems) ""came to be accepted."" His present theory, if"
1257,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"admitted, does account for the acceptation of a single version of the"
1258,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"poems, the first standard _written_ version, but fails to explain how"
1259,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"""the caprice of the different reciters"" (as he says) did not wander into"
1260,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"every variety of anachronism in detail and in diction, thus producing"
1261,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,a chaos which no editor of about 540 A.D. could force into its present
1262,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,uniformity.
1263,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1264,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Such an editor is now postulated by Mr. Leaf. If his editor's edition,"
1265,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"as being _written_, was accepted by Greece, then we ""understand how a"
1266,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"single version came to be accepted."" But we do not understand how"
1267,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the editor could possibly introduce a harmony which could only have
1268,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"characterised his materials, as Mr. Leaf has justly remarked, if there"
1269,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"was an Homeric school ""to maintain a fixed standard."" But now such"
1270,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,harmony in the picture of life as exists in the poems is left without
1271,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"any explanation. We have now, by the theory, a crowd of rhapsodists,"
1272,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"many generations of uncontrolled wandering men, who, for several"
1273,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"centuries,"
1274,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1275,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"""Rave, recite, and madden through the land,"""
1276,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1277,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"with no written texts, and with no ""fixed body to maintain a standard."""
1278,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,Such men would certainly not adhere strictly to a stereotyped early
1279,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,tradition: _that_ we cannot expect from them.
1280,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1281,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Again, no editor of about 540 B.C. could possibly bring harmony of"
1282,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"manners, customs, and diction into such of their recitals as he took"
1283,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,down in writing.
1284,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1285,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,Let us think out the supposed editor's situation. During three centuries
1286,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,nine generations of strollers have worked their will on one ancient
1287,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"short poem, _The Wrath_ of _Achilles_. This is, in itself, an unexampled"
1288,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"fact. Poets turn to new topics; they do not, as a rule, for centuries"
1289,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,embroider one single situation out of the myriads which heroic legend
1290,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"affords. Strolling reciters are the least careful of men, each would"
1291,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"recite in the language and grammar of his day, and introduce the newly"
1292,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"evolved words and idioms, the new and fashionable manners, costume, and"
1293,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"weapons of his time. When war chariots became obsolete, he would bring"
1294,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"in cavalry; when there was no Over-Lord, he would not trouble himself"
1295,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,to maintain correctly the character and situation of Agamemnon. He would
1296,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"speak of coined money, in cases of buying and selling; his European"
1297,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,geography would often be wrong; he would not ignore the Ionian cities
1298,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"of Asia; most weapons would be of iron, not bronze, in his lays. Ionian"
1299,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"religious ideas could not possibly be excluded, nor changes in customary"
1300,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"law, civil and criminal. Yet, we think, none of these things occurs in"
1301,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,Homer.
1302,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1303,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,The editor of the theory had to correct all these anachronisms and
1304,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,discrepancies. What a task in an uncritical age! The editor's materials
1305,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"would be the lays known to such strollers as happened to be gathered,"
1306,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"in Athens, perhaps at the Panathenaic festival. The _répertoire_ of each"
1307,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,stroller would vary indefinitely from those of all the others. One man
1308,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"knew this chant, as modified or made by himself; other men knew others,"
1309,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,equally unsatisfactory.
1310,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1311,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,The editor must first have written down from recitation all the passages
1312,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,that he could collect. Then he was obliged to construct a narrative
1313,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"sequence containing a plot, which he fashioned by a process of selection"
1314,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"and rejection; and then he had to combine passages, alter them, add"
1315,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"as much as he thought fit, remove anachronisms, remove discrepancies,"
1316,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"accidentally bring in fresh discrepancies (as always happens), weave"
1317,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"transitional passages, look with an antiquarian eye after the too"
1318,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"manifest modernisms in language and manners, and so produce the [blank"
1319,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"space]. That, in the sixth century B.C., any man undertook such a task,"
1320,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,and succeeded so well as to impose on Aristotle and all the later Greek
1321,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"critics, appears to be a theory that could only occur to a modern man of"
1322,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"letters, who is thinking of the literary conditions of his own time."
1323,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"The editor was doing, and doing infinitely better, what Lönnrot, in the"
1324,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"nineteenth century, tried in vain to achieve for the Finnish _Kalewala_."
1325,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"[Footnote: See Comparetti, _The Kalewala_.]"
1326,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1327,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Centuries later than Pisistratus, in a critical age, Apollonius Rhodius"
1328,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,set about writing an epic of the Homeric times. We know how entirely he
1329,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"failed, on all hands, to restore the manner of Homer. The editor of 540"
1330,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,B.C. was a more scientific man. Can any one who sets before himself the
1331,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,nature of the editor's task believe in him and it? To the master-less
1332,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"floating jellyfish of old poems and new, Mr. Leaf supposes that ""but"
1333,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,small and unimportant additions were made after the end of the eighth
1334,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"century or thereabouts,"" especially as ""the creative and imaginative"
1335,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"forces of the Ionian race turned to other forms of expression,"" to"
1336,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"lyrics and to philosophic poems. But the able Pisistratean editor, after"
1337,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"all, we find, introduced quantities of new matter into the poems--in the"
1338,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"middle of the sixth century; that kind of industry, then, did not cease"
1339,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"towards the end of the eighth century, as we have been told. On the"
1340,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"other hand, as we shall learn, the editor contributed to the _Iliad_,"
1341,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"among other things, Nestor's descriptions of his youthful adventures,"
1342,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"for the purpose of flattering Nestor's descendant, the tyrant"
1343,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,Pisistratus of Athens.
1344,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1345,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"One hypothesis, the theory of an Homeric school--which would answer our"
1346,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"question, ""How was the harmony of the picture of life in remote ages"
1347,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"preserved in poems composed in several succeeding ages, and in totally"
1348,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"altered conditions of life?""--Mr. Leaf, as we know, rejects. We might"
1349,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"suggest, again, that there were written texts handed down from an early"
1350,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"period, and preserved in new copies from generation to generation. Mr."
1351,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Leaf states his doubt that there were any such texts. ""The poems were"
1352,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,all this time handed down orally only by tradition among the singers
1353,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"(_sic_), who used to wander over Greece reciting them at popular"
1354,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,festivals. Writing was indeed known through the whole period of epic
1355,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"development"" (some four centuries at least), ""but it is in the highest"
1356,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,degree unlikely that it was ever employed to form a standard text of the
1357,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,Epic or _ANY_ part of it. There can hardly have been any standard text;
1358,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,at best there was a continuous tradition of those parts of the poems
1359,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"which were especially popular, and the knowledge of which was a valuable"
1360,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"asset to the professional reciter."""
1361,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1362,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,Now we would not contend for the existence of any [blank space] text
1363,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"much before 600 B.C., and I understand Mr. Leaf not to deny, now, that"
1364,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"there may have been texts of the _ODYSSEY_ and _Iliad_ before, say,"
1365,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"600-540 B.C. If cities and reciters had any ancient texts, then texts"
1366,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"existed, though not ""standard"" texts: and by this means the harmony of"
1367,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"thought, character, and detail in the poems might be preserved. We do"
1368,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"not think that it is ""in the highest degree unlikely"" that there were no"
1369,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,texts. Is this one of the many points on which every savant must rely on
1370,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"his own sense of what is ""likely""? To this essential point, the almost"
1371,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"certain existence of written texts, we return in our conclusion."
1372,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1373,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,What we have to account for is not only the relative lack of
1374,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,anachronisms in poems supposed to have been made through a period of at
1375,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"least four hundred years, but also the harmony of the _CHARACTERS_"
1376,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,in subtle details. Some of the characters will be dealt with later;
1377,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"meanwhile it is plain that Mr. Leaf, when he rejects both the idea"
1378,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"of written texts prior to 600-540 B.C., and also the idea of a school"
1379,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"charged with the duty of ""maintaining a fixed standard,"" leaves a"
1380,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"terrible task to his supposed editor of orally transmitted poems which,"
1381,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"he says--if unpreserved by text or school--""must have ended by varying"
1382,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"infinitely according to the caprice of their various reciters."""
1383,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"[Footnote: _Companion to the Iliad, p. 21._]"
1384,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1385,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,On that head there can be no doubt; in the supposed circumstances no
1386,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"harmony, no _unus_ color, could have survived in the poems till the days"
1387,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,of the sixth century editor.
1388,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,
1389,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"Here, then, is another difficulty in the path of the theory that the"
1390,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"_Iliad_ is the work of four centuries. If it was, we are not enabled to"
1391,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,understand how it came to be what it is. No editor could possibly tinker
1392,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,it into the whole which we possess; none could steer clear of many
1393,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,"absurd anachronisms. These are found by critics, but it is our hope to"

1400,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS",It has been shown in the text that in 1892 Mr. Leaf thought the story

1408,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","_Iliad_, in the sixth century, the age of Pisistratus, was the silence"
1409,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS",of Aristarchus on the subject. He discussed the authenticity of lines
1410,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","in the _Iliad_ which, according to the legend, were interpolated for a"
1411,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","political purpose by Solon or Pisistratus, but, as far as his comments"
1412,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","have reached us in the scholia, he never said a word about the tradition"
1413,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","of Athenian interpolation. Now Aristarchus must, at least, have known"
1414,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","the tradition of the political use of a disputed line, for Aristotle"
1415,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","writes (_Rhetoric_, i. 15) that the Athenians, early in the sixth"
1416,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","century, quoted _Iliad_, II. 558, to prove their right to Salamis."
1417,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","Aristarchus also discussed _Iliad_, II. 553, 555, to which the Spartans"
1418,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","appealed on the question of supreme command against Persia (Herodotus,"
1419,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","vii. 159). Again Aristarchus said nothing, or nothing that has reached"
1420,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","us, about Athenian interpolation. Once more, Odyssey, II. 631, was said"
1421,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","by Hereas, a Megarian writer, to have been interpolated by Pisistratus"
1422,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","(Plutarch.) But ""the scholia that represent the teaching of Aristarchus"""
1423,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS",never make any reference to the alleged dealings of Pisistratus with the
1424,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","_Iliad_. The silence of Aristarchus, however, affords no safe ground of"
1425,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS",argument to believers or disbelievers in the original edition written
1426,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS",out by order of Pisistratus.
1427,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS",
1428,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS",It can never be proved that the scholiasts did not omit what Aristarchus
1429,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","said, though we do not know why they should have done so; and it can"
1430,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS",never be proved that Aristarchus was ignorant of the traditions about
1431,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","Pisistratus, or that he thought them unworthy of notice. All is matter"
1432,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS",of conjecture on these points. Mr. Leaf's conversion to belief in the
1433,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS",story that our _Iliad_ was practically edited and first committed to
1434,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS",writing under Pisistratus appears to be due to the probability that
1435,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","Aristarchus must have known the tradition. But if he did, there is no"
1436,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","proof that he accepted it as historically authentic. There is not, in"
1437,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","fact, any proof even that Aristarchus must have known the tradition. He"
1438,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","had probably read Dieuchidas of Megara, for ""Wilamowitz has shown that"
1439,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","Dieuchidas wrote in the fourth century."" [Footnote: _Iliad_, vol. i."
1440,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","p. xix.] But, unluckily, we do not know that Dieuchidas stated that the"

1442,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","B.C. No mortal knows what Dieuchidas said: and, again, what Dieuchidas"
1443,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS",said is not evidence. He wrote as a partisan in a historical dispute.

1446,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","the _Iliad_, is interwoven with a legend about an early appeal, in"
1447,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","the beginning of the sixth century B.C., to Homer as an historical"
1448,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","authority. The Athenians and Megarians, contending for the possession of"

1450,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS",their differences before the Spartans (_cir._ 600-580 B.C.). Each party
1451,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","quoted Homer as evidence. Aristotle, who, as we saw, mentions the tale"
1452,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","(Rhetoric, i. 15), merely says that the Athenians cited _Iliad_,"
1453,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","II. 558: ""Aias led and stationed his men where the phalanxes of the"
1454,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","Athenians were posted."" Aristarchus condemned this line, not (as far"
1455,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS",as evidence goes) because there was a tradition that the Athenians
1456,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","had interpolated it to prove their point, but because he thought it"
1457,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","inconsistent with _Iliad_, III. 230; IV. 251, which, if I may differ"
1458,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","from so great a critic, it is not; these two passages deal, not with"

1460,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS",occasion. But if Aristarchus had thought the tradition of Athenian

1462,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS",support of his opinion. Perhaps he did. No reference to his notice has
1463,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS","reached us. However this may be, Mr. Leaf mainly bases his faith in"

1973,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",Dream of success to Agamemnon. What were the fortunes of that oldest
1974,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","of all old kernels? In this version (A) Agamemnon, having had no Dream,"
1975,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",summoned a peaceful assembly to discuss the awkwardness caused by the
1976,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","mutiny of Achilles. The host met (_Iliad,_ II. 87-99). Here we pass from"
1977,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","line 99 to 212-242: Thersites it is who opens the debate, (in version A)"
1978,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","insults Agamemnon, and advises flight. The army rushed off to launch the"

1981,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",
1982,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",Version A appears to us to have been a version that no heroic audience
1983,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",would endure. A low person like Thersites opens a debate in an assembly
1984,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",called by the Over-Lord; this could not possibly pass unchallenged among
1985,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","listeners living in the feudal age. When a prince called an assembly,"
1986,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","he himself opened the debate, as Achilles does in Book I. 54-67. That"

1989,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","in an assembly convoked by the Over-Lord, would have been regarded"

1991,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",intolerable poetical license. Thersites would have been at once pulled

2013,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","chance of a life time, and takes it; because Agamemnon, by means of the"
2014,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","test--a proposal to flee homewards--which succeeded, it is said, in the"
2015,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","case of Cortès,--has reduced the host, already discontented, to a mob."

2019,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",put ourselves at the point of view of the original listeners. Thersites
2020,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","merely continues, in full assembly, the mutinous babble which he has"

2027,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",We have now examined Mr. Leaf's two supposed earliest versions of the

2029,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","Thetis, no promise of Zeus, and no Dream, and with Thersites opening"
2030,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","debate, is jejune, unpoetical, and omits the gentler and most winning"

2032,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",been accepted by a feudal audience for the reasons already given. His
2033,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","presumed later version (B), with Thetis, Zeus, and the false Dream,"
2034,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","cannot be, or certainly has not been, brought by Mr. Leaf into congruous"
2035,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","connection with Book XI., and it results in the fighting of the"
2036,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","_unarmed_ Agamemnon, which no poet could have been so careless as to"
2037,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","invent. Agamemnon could not go into battle without helmet, shield, and"

2039,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",could not have opened a debate when the Over-Lord had called the
2040,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","Assembly, nor could he have moved the chiefs to prepare for flight,"
2041,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","unless, as in the actual _Iliad_, they had already been demoralised"
2042,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","by the result of the feigned proposal of flight by Agamemnon, and its"
2043,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",effect upon the host. Probably every reader who understands heroic

2045,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",
2046,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",Our own opinion is that the difficulties in the poem are caused partly
2047,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","by the poet's conception of the violent, wavering, excitable,"
2048,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","and unstable character of Agamemnon; partly by some accident, now"
2049,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","indiscoverable, save by conjecture, which has happened to the text."

2057,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","obviously, was no longer so sanguine, once awake!"

2062,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","to war, as the Dream bade him do. Probably he thought that the host was"

2066,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",by our ignorance of the regular procedure in Homeric times. Was the host
2067,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","not in arms and fighting every day, when there was no truce? There seems"
2068,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","to have been no armistice after the mutiny of Achilles, for we are"

2072,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","(I. 489, 492). Thus it seems that war went on, and that assemblies were"
2073,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","being held, in the absence of Achilles. It appears, however, that the"
2074,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","fighting was mere skirmishing and raiding, no general onslaught was"
2075,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","attempted; and from Book II. _73_, 83 it seems to have been a matter"
2076,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","of doubt, with Agamemnon and Nestor, whether the army would venture a"
2077,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",pitched battle.
2078,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",
2079,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","It also appears, from the passage cited (I. 489, 492) that assemblies"
2080,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",were being regularly held; we are told that Achilles did not attend
2081,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","them. Yet, when we come to the assembly (II. 86-100) it seems to have"
2082,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","been a special and exciting affair, to judge by the brilliant picture"
2083,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","of the crowds, the confusion, and the cries. Nothing of the sort is"
2084,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",indicated in the meeting of the assembly in I. _54-5_ 8. Why is there
2085,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",so much excitement at the assembly of Book II.? Partly because it was
2086,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","summoned _at_ dawn, whereas the usual thing was for the host to meet"
2087,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",in arms before fighting on the plain or going on raids; assemblies were
2088,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","held when the day's work was over. The host, therefore, when summoned"
2089,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","to an assembly _at dawn_, expects to hear of something out of the"
2090,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",common--as the mutiny of Achilles suggests--and is excited.

2092,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","We must ask, then, why does Agamemnon, after the Dream has told him"
2093,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",merely to summon the host to arm--a thing of daily routine--call a
2094,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","deliberative morning assembly, a thing clearly not of routine? If"
2095,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","Agamemnon is really full of confidence, inspired by the Dream, why does"
2096,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","he determine, not to do what is customary, call the men to arms, but"
2097,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","as Jeanne d'Arc said to the Dauphin, to ""hold such long and weary"
2098,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","councils""? Mr. Jevons speaks of Agamemnon's ""confidence in the delusive"
2099,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","dream"" as at variance with his proceedings, and would excise II. 35-41,"
2100,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","""the only lines which represent Agamemnon as confidently believing in"
2101,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","the Dream."" [Footnote: _Journal_ of _Hellenic_ Studies, vol. vii. pp."
2102,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","306, 307.] But the poet never once says that Agamemnon, awake, did"
2103,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",believe confidently in the Dream! Agamemnon dwelt with hope _while_
2104,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","asleep; when he wakened--he went and called a peaceful morning assembly,"
2105,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",though the Dream bade him call to arms. He did not dare to risk his
2106,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",authority. This was exactly in keeping with his character. The poet
2107,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","should have said, ""When he woke, the Dream appeared to him rather poor"
2108,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","security for success"" (saying so in poetic language, of course), and"
2109,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",then there would be no difficulty in the summoning of an assembly at
2110,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",dawn. But either the poet expected us to understand the difference
2111,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","between the hopes of Agamemnon sleeping, and the doubts of Agamemnon"
2112,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",waking to chill realities--an experience common to all of us who
2113,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",dream--or some explanatory lines have been dropped out--one or two would
2114,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",have cleared up the matter.
2115,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",
2116,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","If I am right, the poet has not been understood. People have not"
2117,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","observed that Agamemnon hopes while asleep, and doubts, and acts on his"
2118,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","doubt, when awake. Thus Mr. Leaf writes: ""Elated by the dream, as we are"
2119,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","led to suppose, Agamemnon summons the army--to lead them into battle?"
2120,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","Nothing of the sort; he calls them to assembly."" [Footnote: _Iliad_,"
2121,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",vol. ii. p. 46.] But we ought not to have been led to suppose that
2122,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",the waking Agamemnon was so elated as the sleeping Agamemnon. He was
2123,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","""disillusioned"" on waking; his conduct proves it; he did not know what"
2124,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",to think about the Dream; he did not know how the host would take the
2125,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","Dream; he doubted whether they would fight at his command, so he called"
2126,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",an assembly.
2127,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",
2128,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",Mr. Jevons very justly cites a parallel case. Grote has remarked that in
2129,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","Book VII. of Herodotus, ""The dream sent by the Gods to frighten Xerxes"

2135,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.","not proceed. Why? Because, says Herodotus, ""when day came, he thought"

2571,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","stately _tholos_ tombs nor in shaft graves, as at Mycenae: whether"
2572,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","they be princes or simple oarsmen, they are cremated. A pyre of wood is"
2573,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","built; on this the warrior's body is laid, the pyre is lighted, the body"
2574,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","is reduced to ashes, the ashes are placed in a vessel or box of gold,"
2575,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","wrapped round with precious cloths (no arms are buried, as a general"

2577,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","a _stele_ or pillar crowns the edifice. This method is almost uniform,"
2578,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","and, as far as cremation and the cairn go, is universal in the _Iliad_"
2579,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION",and _Odyssey_ whenever a burial is described. Now this mode of
2580,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION",interment must be the mode of a single age in Greek civilisation. It is
2581,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","confessedly not the method of the Mycenaeans of the shaft grave, or of"
2582,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","the latter _tholos_ or stone beehive-shaped grave; again, the Mycenaeans"
2583,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","did not burn the dead; they buried. Once more, the Homeric method is not"

2585,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","outside the Dipylon gate of Athens. The people of that age now buried,"
2586,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","now burned, their dead, and did not build cairns over them. Thus the"
2587,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION",Homeric custom comes between the shaft graves and the latter _tholos_
2588,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","graves, on the one hand, and the Dipylon custom of burning or burying,"
2589,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","with sunk or rock-hewn graves, on the other."
2590,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION",
2591,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION",The Homeric poets describe the method of their own period. They
2592,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION",assuredly do not adhere to an older epic tradition of shaft graves or

2594,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION",period when such methods of disposal of the dead were in vogue. The
2595,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION",altar above the shaft-graves in Mycenae proves the cult of ancestors in
2596,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","Mycenae; of this cult in the _Iliad_ there is no trace, or only a"
2597,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION",dim trace of survival in the slaughter of animals at the funeral. The

2599,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","things beyond the river Oceanus, did not permit them to be worshipped"
2600,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","as potent beings. Only in a passage, possibly interpolated, of the"
2601,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","_Odyssey_, do we hear that Castor and Polydeuces, brothers of Helen,"
2602,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","and sons of Tyndareus, through the favour of Zeus have immortality, and"
2603,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","receive divine honours. [Footnote: Odyssey, XI. 298-304.]"
2604,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION",
2605,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION",These facts are so familiar that we are apt to overlook the strangeness

2612,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","many African tribes, ancestor worship is almost the whole of practical"
2613,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","cult. Usually it accompanies polytheism, existing beside it on a lower"
2614,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION",plane. It was prevalent in the Mycenae of the shaft graves; in Attica
2615,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION",it was uninterrupted; it is conspicuous in Greece from the ninth century
2616,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","onwards. But it is unknown to or ignored by the Homeric poets, though it"
2617,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","can hardly have died out of folk custom. Consequently, the poems are"
2618,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","of one age, an age of cremation and of burial in barrows, with no ghost"
2619,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION",worship. Apparently some revolution as regards burial occurred between

2621,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","That age, coming with its form of burning and its absence of the cult"

2628,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION",was not one in which iron was used for swords and spears. At Assarlik
2629,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","(Asia Minor) and in Thera early graves, prove the use of cremation,"

2642,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION",cremation is matter of conjecture. It has been suggested that burning
2643,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION",was introduced during the migrations after the Dorian invasion. Men
2644,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION",could carry the ashes of their friends to the place where they finally
2645,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","settled. [Footnote: Helbig, _Homerische Epos,_ p.83] The question may,"
2646,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","perhaps, be elucidated by excavation, especially in Asia Minor, on"
2647,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION",the sites of the earliest Greek colonies. At Colophon are many cairns
2648,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","unexplored by science. Mr. Ridgeway, as is well known, attributes the"

2651,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","prevailed in Britain during the Age of Bronze, and co-existed with"
2652,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","inhumation in the great cemetery of Hallstatt, surviving into the Age of"

2670,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION",others buried in hollow trees; others simply inhumed. Some placed the

2674,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION","explanation of burning was that it prevented the dead from returning,"
2675,"ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ""ILIAD"". BURIAL AND CREMATION",thus it has always been usual to burn the bodies of vampires. Did a race

2785,MEMORIAL.,This colonial theory is one of Helbig's too venturous generalisations.
2786,MEMORIAL.,"He studies the ghost, or rather dream-apparition, of Patroclus after"
2787,MEMORIAL.,examining the funeral of Hector; but we shall begin with Patroclus.
2788,MEMORIAL.,"Achilles (XXIII. 4-16) first hails his friend ""even in the House of"
2789,MEMORIAL.,"Hades"" (so he believes that spirits are in Hades), and says that he"
2790,MEMORIAL.,"has brought Hector ""raw for dogs to devour,"" and twelve Trojans of good"
2791,MEMORIAL.,"family ""to slaughter before thy pyre."" That night, when Achilles is"
2792,MEMORIAL.,asleep (XXIII. 65) the spirit ([Greek: psyche]) of Patroclus appears to
2793,MEMORIAL.,"him, says that he is forgotten, and begs to be burned at once, that he"
2794,MEMORIAL.,"may pass the gates of Hades, for the other spirits drive him off and"
2795,MEMORIAL.,"will not let him associate with them ""beyond the River,"" and he wanders"
2796,MEMORIAL.,"vaguely along the wide-gated dwelling of Hades. ""Give me thy hand, for"
2797,MEMORIAL.,"never more again shall I come back from Hades, when ye have given me my"
2798,MEMORIAL.,"due of fire."" Patroclus, being newly discarnate, does not yet know"
2799,MEMORIAL.,"that a spirit cannot take a living man's hand, though, in fact, tactile"
2800,MEMORIAL.,hallucinations are not uncommon in the presence of phantasms of the
2801,MEMORIAL.,"dead. ""Lay not my bones apart from thine ... let one coffer"" ([Greek:"

2807,MEMORIAL.,Hector was buried in a _larnax_; SO will Achilles and Patroclus be
2808,MEMORIAL.,"when Achilles falls, but the dust of Patroclus is kept, meanwhile, in a"
2809,MEMORIAL.,golden covered cup (phialae) in the quarters of Achilles; it is not laid
2810,MEMORIAL.,in howe after his cremation (XXIII. 243).
2811,MEMORIAL.,
2812,MEMORIAL.,"Achilles tries to embrace Patroclus, but fails, like Odysseus with the"
2813,MEMORIAL.,"shade of his mother in Hades, in the _ODYSSEY_. He exclaims that ""there"
2814,MEMORIAL.,remaineth then even in the House of Hades a spirit and phantom of the
2815,MEMORIAL.,"dead, albeit the life"" (or the wits) ""be not anywise therein, for all"
2816,MEMORIAL.,"night hath the spirit of hapless Patroclus stood over me...."""
2817,MEMORIAL.,
2818,MEMORIAL.,In this speech Helbig detects the hand of the late Ionian poet. What
2819,MEMORIAL.,"goes before is part of the genuine old Epic, the kernel, done at a time"
2820,MEMORIAL.,when men believed that spooks could take part in the affairs of the
2821,MEMORIAL.,"upper world. Achilles therefore (in his dream), thought that he"
2822,MEMORIAL.,"could embrace his friend. It was the sceptical Ionian, in a fresh and"
2823,MEMORIAL.,"spookless colony, who knew that he could not; he thinks the ghost a mere"
2824,MEMORIAL.,"dream, and introduces his scepticism in XXIII. 99-107. He brought"
2825,MEMORIAL.,"in ""the ruling ideas of his own period."" The ghost, says the Ionian"
2826,MEMORIAL.,"_bearbeiter_, is intangible, though in the genuine old epic the ghost"
2827,MEMORIAL.,himself thought otherwise--he being new to the situation and without
2828,MEMORIAL.,"experience. This is the first sample of the critical Ionian spirit,"
2829,MEMORIAL.,"later so remarkable in philosophy and natural science, says Helbig."
2830,MEMORIAL.,"[Footnote: Op. laud., pp. 233,234.]"
2831,MEMORIAL.,
2832,MEMORIAL.,We need not discuss this acute critical theory. The natural
2833,MEMORIAL.,"interpretation of the words of Achilles is obvious; as Mr. Leaf remarks,"
2834,MEMORIAL.,"the words are ""the cry of sudden personal conviction in a matter which"
2835,MEMORIAL.,"has hitherto been lazily accepted as an orthodox dogma."" [Footnote:"
2836,MEMORIAL.,"_Iliad_, vol. ii. p. 620.] Already, as we have seen, Achilles has made"
2837,MEMORIAL.,"promises to Patroclus in the House of Hades, now he exclaims ""there"
2838,MEMORIAL.,"really is something in the doctrine of a feeble future life."""
2839,MEMORIAL.,
2840,MEMORIAL.,It is vain to try to discriminate between an old epic belief in
2841,MEMORIAL.,"able-bodied ghosts and an Ionian belief in mere futile _shades_, in"
2842,MEMORIAL.,the Homeric poems. Everywhere the dead are too feeble to be worth
2843,MEMORIAL.,"worshipping after they are burned; but, as Mr. Leaf says with obvious"
2844,MEMORIAL.,"truth, and with modern instances, ""men are never so inconsistent as in"
2845,MEMORIAL.,"their beliefs about the other world."" We ourselves hold various beliefs"
2846,MEMORIAL.,"simultaneously. The natives of Australia and of Tasmania practise, or"
2847,MEMORIAL.,"did practise, every conceivable way of disposing of the dead--burying,"
2848,MEMORIAL.,"burning, exposure in trees, carrying about the bodies or parts of them,"
2849,MEMORIAL.,"eating the bodies, and so forth. If each such practice corresponded, as"
2850,MEMORIAL.,"archaeologists believe, to a different opinion about the soul, then"
2851,MEMORIAL.,"all beliefs were held together at once, and this, in fact, is the case."
2852,MEMORIAL.,There is not now one and now another hard and fast orthodoxy of belief
2853,MEMORIAL.,"about the dead, though now we find ancestor worship prominent and now in"
2854,MEMORIAL.,the shade.
2855,MEMORIAL.,
2856,MEMORIAL.,"After gifts of hair and the setting up of jars full of oil and honey,"
2857,MEMORIAL.,Achilles has the body laid on the top of the pyre in the centre. Bodies
2858,MEMORIAL.,"of sheep and oxen, two dogs and four horses, are strewed around: why, we"
2859,MEMORIAL.,"know not, for the dead is not supposed to need food: the rite may be"
2860,MEMORIAL.,"a survival, for there were sacrifices at the burials of the Mycenaean"
2861,MEMORIAL.,"shaft graves. Achilles slays also the twelve Trojans, ""because of mine"
2862,MEMORIAL.,"anger at thy slaying,"" he says (XXIII. 23). This was his reason, as far"
2863,MEMORIAL.,"as he consciously had any reason, not that his friend might have twelve"
2864,MEMORIAL.,thralls in Hades. After the pyre is alit Achilles drenches it all night
2865,MEMORIAL.,"with wine, and, when the flame dies down, the dead hero's bones are"
2866,MEMORIAL.,collected and placed in the covered cup of gold. The circle of the
2867,MEMORIAL.,"barrow is then marked out, stones are set up round it (we see them round"
2868,MEMORIAL.,"Highland tumuli), and earth is heaped up; no more is done; the tomb is"
2869,MEMORIAL.,empty; the covered cup holding the ashes is in the hut of Achilles.
2870,MEMORIAL.,
2871,MEMORIAL.,"We must note another trait. After the body of Patroclus was recovered,"
2872,MEMORIAL.,"it was washed, anointed, laid on a bier, and covered from head to foot"
2873,MEMORIAL.,"[Greek: heano liti], translated by Helbig, ""with a linen sheet"" (cf."
2874,MEMORIAL.,XXIII. 254). The golden cup with the ashes is next wrapped [Greek: heano
2875,MEMORIAL.,"liti]; here Mr. Myers renders the words ""with a linen veil."" Scottish"
2876,MEMORIAL.,cremation burials of the Bronze Age retain traces of linen wrappings
2877,MEMORIAL.,of the urn. [Footnote: _Proceedings of the Scottish society of
2878,MEMORIAL.,"Antiquaries_, 1905, p. 552. For other cases, _cf._ Leaf, _Iliad_, XXIV."
2879,MEMORIAL.,796. Note.] Over all a white [Greek: pharos] (mantle) was spread. In
2880,MEMORIAL.,"_Iliad_, XXIV. 231, twelve [Greek: pharea] with chitons, single cloaks,"
2881,MEMORIAL.,"and other articles of dress, are taken to Achilles by Priam as part of"
2882,MEMORIAL.,the ransom of Hector's body. Such is the death-garb of Patroclus; but
2883,MEMORIAL.,"Helbig, looking for Ionian innovations in Book XXIV., finds that the"
2884,MEMORIAL.,death-garb of Hector is not the same as that of Patroclus in Book XXIII.
2885,MEMORIAL.,One difference is that when the squires of Achilles took the ransom of
2886,MEMORIAL.,"Hector from the waggon of Priam, they left in it two [Greek: pharea] and"
2887,MEMORIAL.,a well-spun chiton. The women washed and anointed Hector's body; they
2888,MEMORIAL.,"clad him in the chiton, and threw one [Greek: pharos] over it; we are"
2889,MEMORIAL.,"not told what they did with the other. Perhaps, as Mr. Leaf says, it was"
2890,MEMORIAL.,"used as a cover for the bier, perhaps it was not, but was laid under the"
2891,MEMORIAL.,body (Helbig). All we know is that Hector's body was restored to Priam
2892,MEMORIAL.,"in a chiton and a [Greek: pharos], which do not seem to have been"
2893,MEMORIAL.,"removed before he was burned; while Patroclus had no chiton in death,"
2894,MEMORIAL.,"but a [Greek: pharos] and, apparently, a linen sheet."
2895,MEMORIAL.,
2896,MEMORIAL.,"To the ordinary reader this does not seem, in the circumstances, a"
2897,MEMORIAL.,strong mark of different ages and different burial customs. Priam did
2898,MEMORIAL.,not bring any linen sheet--or whatever [Greek: heanos lis] may be--in
2899,MEMORIAL.,the waggon as part of Hector's ransom; and it neither became Achilles
2900,MEMORIAL.,to give nor Priam to receive any of Achilles's stuff as death-garb for
2901,MEMORIAL.,"Hector. The squires, therefore, gave back to Priam, to clothe his dead"
2902,MEMORIAL.,"son, part of what he had brought; nothing can be more natural, and"
2903,MEMORIAL.,"there, we may say, is an end on't. They did what they could in the"
2904,MEMORIAL.,"circumstances. But Helbig has observed that, in a Cean inscription of"
2905,MEMORIAL.,"the fifth century B.C., there is a sumptuary law, forbidding a corpse to"
2906,MEMORIAL.,"wear more than three white garments, a sheet under him, a chiton, and a"
2907,MEMORIAL.,"mantle cast over him. [Footnote: op. _laud_., p. 209.] He supposes that"
2908,MEMORIAL.,"Hector wore the chiton, and had one [Greek: pharos] over him and the"
2909,MEMORIAL.,"other under him, though Homer does not say that. The Laws of Solon also"
2910,MEMORIAL.,"confined the dead man to three articles of dress. [Footnote: Plutarch,"
2911,MEMORIAL.,"Solon, 21.] In doing so Solon sanctioned an old custom, and that Ionian"
2912,MEMORIAL.,"custom, described by the author of Book XXIV., bewrays him, says Helbig,"
2913,MEMORIAL.,"for a late Ionian _bearbeiter_, deserting true epic usages and inserting"
2914,MEMORIAL.,"those of his own day. But in some Attic Dipylon vases, in the pictures"
2915,MEMORIAL.,"of funerals, we see no garments or sheets over the corpses."
2916,MEMORIAL.,
2917,MEMORIAL.,"Penelope also wove a [Greek: charos] against the burial of old Laertes,"
2918,MEMORIAL.,but surely she ought to have woven for him; on Helbig's showing Hector
2919,MEMORIAL.,"had _two_, Patroclus had only one; Patroclus is in the old epic, Hector"
2920,MEMORIAL.,"and Laertes are in the Ionian epics; therefore, Laertes should have had"
2921,MEMORIAL.,two [Greek: charea] but we only hear of one. Penelope had to finish the
2922,MEMORIAL.,"[Greek: charos] and show it; [Footnote: Odyssey, XXIV. 147.] now if she"
2923,MEMORIAL.,"wanted to delay her marriage, she should have begun the second [Greek:"
2924,MEMORIAL.,"charos] just as necessary as the first, if Hector, with a pair of"
2925,MEMORIAL.,[Greek: charea] represents Ionian usage. But Penelope never thought of
2926,MEMORIAL.,"what, had she read Helbig, she would have seen to be so obvious. She"
2927,MEMORIAL.,thought of no funeral garments for the old man but one shroud [Greek:
2928,MEMORIAL.,"speiron] (Odyssey, II. 102; XIX. 147); yet, being, by the theory, a"
2929,MEMORIAL.,"character of late Ionian, not of genuine old AEolic epic, she should"
2930,MEMORIAL.,have known better. It is manifest that if even the acuteness and vast
2931,MEMORIAL.,erudition of Helbig can only find such invisible differences as
2932,MEMORIAL.,these between the manners of the genuine old epic and the late Ionian
2933,MEMORIAL.,"innovations, there is really no difference, beyond such trifles as"
2934,MEMORIAL.,diversify custom in any age.
2935,MEMORIAL.,
2936,MEMORIAL.,"Hector, when burned and when his ashes have been placed in the casket,"
2937,MEMORIAL.,"is laid in a [Greek: kapetos], a ditch or trench (_Iliad_, XV. 356;"
2938,MEMORIAL.,XVIII. 564); but here (XXIV. 797) [Greek: kapetos] is a chamber covered
2939,MEMORIAL.,"with great stones, within the howe, the casket being swathed with purple"
2940,MEMORIAL.,"robes, and this was the end. The ghost of Hector would not revisit the"
2941,MEMORIAL.,"sun, as ghosts do freely in the Cyclic poems, a proof that the Cyclics"
2942,MEMORIAL.,"are later than the Homeric poems. [Footnote: Helbig, op. _laud_., pp."
2943,MEMORIAL.,"240, 241.]"
2944,MEMORIAL.,
2945,MEMORIAL.,If the burning of the weapons of Eetion and Elpenor are traces of
2946,MEMORIAL.,"another than the _old_ AEolic epic faith, [Footnote: Ibid., p. 253.]"
2947,MEMORIAL.,"they are also traces of another than the late _Ionic_ epic faith, for no"
2948,MEMORIAL.,weapons are burned with Hector. In the _Odyssey_ the weapons of Achilles
2949,MEMORIAL.,are not burned; in the _Iliad_ the armour of Patroclus is not burned.
2950,MEMORIAL.,No victims of any kind are burned with Hector: possibly the poet was not
2951,MEMORIAL.,anxious to repeat what he had just described (his last book is already
2952,MEMORIAL.,a very long book); possibly the Trojans did not slay victims at the
2953,MEMORIAL.,burning.
2954,MEMORIAL.,
2955,MEMORIAL.,The howes or barrows built over the Homeric dead were hillocks high
2956,MEMORIAL.,"enough to be good points of outlook for scouts, as in the case of the"
2957,MEMORIAL.,"barrow of AEsyetes (_Iliad_, II. 793) and ""the steep mound,"" the howe of"
2958,MEMORIAL.,lithe Myrine (II. 814). We do not know that women were usually buried
2959,MEMORIAL.,"in howe, but Myrine was a warrior maiden of the Amazons. We know, then,"
2960,MEMORIAL.,"minutely what the Homeric mode of burial was, with such variations as"
2961,MEMORIAL.,have been noted. We have burning and howe even in the case of an obscure
2962,MEMORIAL.,"oarsman like Elpenor. It is not probable, however, that every peaceful"
2963,MEMORIAL.,mechanic had a howe all to himself; he may have had a small family
2964,MEMORIAL.,cairn; he may not have had an expensive cremation.
2965,MEMORIAL.,
2966,MEMORIAL.,The interesting fact is that no barrow burial precisely of the Homeric
2967,MEMORIAL.,kind has ever been discovered in Greek sites. The old Mycenaeans buried
2968,MEMORIAL.,"either in shaft graves or in a stately _tholos_; and in rock chambers,"
2969,MEMORIAL.,"later, in the town cemetery: they did not burn the bodies. The people of"
2970,MEMORIAL.,"the Dipylon period sometimes cremated, sometimes inhumed, but they built"
2971,MEMORIAL.,"no barrow over the dead. [Footnote: _Annal. de l'Inst.,_ 1872, pp. 135,"
2972,MEMORIAL.,"147, 167. Plausen, _ut supra_.] The Dipylon was a period of early iron"
2973,MEMORIAL.,"swords, made on the lines of not the best type of bronze sword. Now, in"
2974,MEMORIAL.,"Mr. Leaf's opinion, our Homeric accounts of burial ""are all late; the"
2975,MEMORIAL.,"oldest parts of the poems tell us nothing."" [Footnote: _Iliad_, vol. ii."
2976,MEMORIAL.,"p. 619. Note 2. While Mr. Leaf says that ""the oldest parts of the poems"
2977,MEMORIAL.,"tell us nothing"" of burial, he accepts XXII. 342, 343 as of the oldest"
2978,MEMORIAL.,"part. These lines describe cremation, and Mr. Leaf does not think them"
2979,MEMORIAL.,"borrowed from the ""later"" VII. 79, 80, but that VII. 79, 80 are ""perhaps"
2980,MEMORIAL.,"borrowed"" from XXII. 342, 343. It follows that ""the oldest parts of the"
2981,MEMORIAL.,"poems"" do tell us of cremation.] We shall show, however, that Mr. Leaf's"
2982,MEMORIAL.,"""kernel"" alludes to cremation. What is ""late""? In this case it is not"
2983,MEMORIAL.,"the Dipylon period, say 900-750 B.C. It is not any later period; one or"
2984,MEMORIAL.,two late barrow burials do not answer to the Homeric descriptions. The
2985,MEMORIAL.,"""late"" parts of the poems, therefore, dealing with burials, in Books"
2986,MEMORIAL.,"VI., VII., XIX., XXIII., XXIV., and the Odyssey, are of an age not"
2987,MEMORIAL.,"in ""the Mycenaean prime,"" not in the Dipylon period, not in any later"
2988,MEMORIAL.,"period, say the seventh or sixth centuries B.C., and, necessarily, not"
2989,MEMORIAL.,of any subsequent period. Yet nobody dreams of saying that the poets
2990,MEMORIAL.,describe a purely fanciful form of interment. They speak of what they
2991,MEMORIAL.,"know in daily life. If it be argued that the late poets preserve, by"
2992,MEMORIAL.,"sheer force of epic tradition, a form of burial unknown in their own"
2993,MEMORIAL.,"age, we ask, ""Why did epic tradition not preserve the burial methods"
2994,MEMORIAL.,"of the Mycenaean prime, the shaft grave, or the _tholos_, without"
2995,MEMORIAL.,"cremation?"""
2996,MEMORIAL.,
2997,MEMORIAL.,"Mr. Leaf's own conclusion is that the people of Mycenae were ""spirit"
2998,MEMORIAL.,"worshippers, practising inhumation, and partial mummification;"" the"
2999,MEMORIAL.,"second fact is dubious. ""In the post-Mycenaean 'Dipylon' period, we"
3000,MEMORIAL.,"find cremation and sepulture practised side by side. In the interval,"
3001,MEMORIAL.,"therefore, two beliefs have come into conflict. [Footnote: All"
3002,MEMORIAL.,"conceivable beliefs, we have said, about the dead are apt to coexist."
3003,MEMORIAL.,For every conceivable and some rather inconceivable contemporary
3004,MEMORIAL.,"Australian modes of dealing with the dead, see Howitt, _Native Tribes of"
3005,MEMORIAL.,"South-East Australia_; Spencer and Gillen, _Northern Tribes of Central"
3006,MEMORIAL.,Australia_.] It seems that the Homeric poems mark this intermediate
3007,MEMORIAL.,"point...."" [Footnote: Leaf, _Iliad_, vol. ii. p. 622.] In that case"
3008,MEMORIAL.,"the Homeric poems are of one age, or, at least, all of them save ""the"
3009,MEMORIAL.,"original kernel"" are of one age, namely, a period subsequent to the"
3010,MEMORIAL.,"Mycenaean prime, but considerably prior to the Dipylon period, which"
3011,MEMORIAL.,"exhibits a mixture of custom; cremation and inhumation coexisting,"
3012,MEMORIAL.,without barrows or howes.
3013,MEMORIAL.,
3014,MEMORIAL.,"We welcome this conclusion, and note that (whatever may be the case"
3015,MEMORIAL.,with the oldest parts of the poems which say nothing about funerals) the
3016,MEMORIAL.,latest expansions must be of about 1100-1000 B.C. (?). The poem is so
3017,MEMORIAL.,early that it is prior to hero worship and ancestor worship; or it
3018,MEMORIAL.,"might be more judicious to say that the poem is of an age that did not,"
3019,MEMORIAL.,"officially, practise ancestor worship, whatever may have occurred in"
3020,MEMORIAL.,folk-custom. The Homeric age is one which had outgrown ancestor and hero
3021,MEMORIAL.,"worship, and had not, like the age of the Cyclics, relapsed into it."
3022,MEMORIAL.,"_Enfin_, unless we agree with Helbig as to essential variations of"
3023,MEMORIAL.,"custom, the poems are the work of one age, and that a brief age, and an"
3024,MEMORIAL.,"age of peculiar customs, cremation and barrow burial; and of a religion"
3025,MEMORIAL.,"that stood, without spirit worship, between the Mycenzean period and the"
3026,MEMORIAL.,ninth century. That seems as certain as anything in prehistoric times
3027,MEMORIAL.,"can be, unless we are to say, that after the age of shaft graves and"
3028,MEMORIAL.,spirit worship came an age of cremation and of no spirit worship; and
3029,MEMORIAL.,that late poets consciously and conscientiously preserved the tradition
3030,MEMORIAL.,"of _this_ period into their own ages of hero worship and inhumation,"
3031,MEMORIAL.,though they did not preserve the tradition of the shaft-grave period.
3032,MEMORIAL.,We cannot accept this theory of adherence to stereotyped poetical
3033,MEMORIAL.,"descriptions, nor can any one consistently adopt it in this case."
3034,MEMORIAL.,
3035,MEMORIAL.,"The reason is obvious. Mr. Leaf, with many other critics, distinguishes"
3036,MEMORIAL.,"several successive periods of ""expansion."" In the first stratum we have"
3037,MEMORIAL.,"the remains of ""the original kernel."" Among these remains is The Slaying"
3038,MEMORIAL.,"of Hector (XXII. 1-404), ""with but slight additions."" [Footnote: Leaf,"
3039,MEMORIAL.,"_Iliad_, vol. ii. p. xi.] In the Slaying of Hector that hero indicates"
3040,MEMORIAL.,"cremation as the mode of burial. ""Give them my body back again, that"
3041,MEMORIAL.,"the Trojans and Trojans' wives grant me my due of fire after my death."""
3042,MEMORIAL.,"Perhaps this allusion to cremation, in the ""original kernel"" in the"
3043,MEMORIAL.,"Slaying of Hector, may be dismissed as a late borrowing from Book VII."
3044,MEMORIAL.,"79, 80, where Hector makes conditions that the fallen hero shall be"
3045,MEMORIAL.,restored to his friends when he challenges the Achaeans to a duel. But
3046,MEMORIAL.,whoever knows the curious economy by way of repetition that marks early
3047,MEMORIAL.,"national epics has a right to regard the allusion to cremation (XXII,"
3048,MEMORIAL.,"342,343) as an example of this practice. Compare _La Chancun de"
3049,MEMORIAL.,"Williame_, lines 1041-1058 with lines 1140-1134. In both the dinner of"
3050,MEMORIAL.,a knight who has been long deprived of food is described in passages
3051,MEMORIAL.,"containing many identical lines. The poet, having found his formula,"
3052,MEMORIAL.,uses it whenever occasion serves. There are several other examples in
3053,MEMORIAL.,"the same epic. [Footnote: _Romania_, xxxiv. PP. 245, 246.] Repetitions"
3054,MEMORIAL.,in Homer need not indicate late additions; the artifice is part of the
3055,MEMORIAL.,"epic as it is of the ballad manner. If we are right, cremation is the"
3056,MEMORIAL.,"mode of burial even in ""the original kernel."" Hector, moreover, in the"
3057,MEMORIAL.,"kernel (XXII. 256-259) makes, before his final fight with Achilles,"
3058,MEMORIAL.,the same proposal as he makes in his challenge to a duel (VII. 85 et
3059,MEMORIAL.,_seqq_.). The victor shall give back the body of the vanquished to his
3060,MEMORIAL.,"friends, but how the friends are to bury it Hector does not say--in this"
3061,MEMORIAL.,"place. When dying, he does say (XXII. 342, 343)."
3062,MEMORIAL.,
3063,MEMORIAL.,"In the kernel and all periods of expansion, funeral rites are described,"
3064,MEMORIAL.,"and in all the method is cremation, with a howe or a barrow. Thus the"
3065,MEMORIAL.,"method of cremation had come in as early as the ""kernel,"" The Slaying"
3066,MEMORIAL.,"of Hector, and as early as the first expansions, and it lasted till the"
3067,MEMORIAL.,"period of the latest expansions, such as Books XXIII., XXIV."
3068,MEMORIAL.,
3069,MEMORIAL.,But what is the approximate date of the various expansions of the
3070,MEMORIAL.,original poem? On that point Mr. Leaf gives his opinion. The Making of
3071,MEMORIAL.,"the Arms of Achilles (Books XVIII., XIX. 1-39) is, with the Funeral of"
3072,MEMORIAL.,"Patroclus (XXIII. 1-256), in the second set of expansions, and is thus"
3073,MEMORIAL.,"two removes later than the original ""kernel."" [Footnote: Leaf, _Iliad_,"
3074,MEMORIAL.,vol. ii. p. xii.] Now this is the period--the Making of the Shield for
3075,MEMORIAL.,"Achilles is, at least, in touch with the period--of ""the eminently free"
3076,MEMORIAL.,"and naturalistic treatment which we find in the best Mycenaean work,"
3077,MEMORIAL.,"in the dagger blades, in the siege fragment, and notably in the Vaphio"
3078,MEMORIAL.,"cups,"" (which show long-haired men, not men close-cropped, as in the"
3079,MEMORIAL.,"daggers and siege fragment). [Footnote: Leaf, _Iliad_, vol. ii. p, 606.]"
3080,MEMORIAL.,"The poet of the age of the second expansions, then,' is at least"
3081,MEMORIAL.,in touch with the work of the shaft grave and ages. He need not be
3082,MEMORIAL.,"contemporary with that epoch, but ""may well have had in his mind the"
3083,MEMORIAL.,"work of artists older than himself."" It is vaguely possible that he may"
3084,MEMORIAL.,"have seen an ancient shield of the Mycenaean prime, and may be inspired"
3085,MEMORIAL.,"by that. [Footnote: _Ibid_., vol. ii. pp. 606, 607.]"
3086,MEMORIAL.,
3087,MEMORIAL.,"Moreover, and still more remarkable, the ordinary Homeric form of"
3088,MEMORIAL.,"cremation and howe-burial is even older than the period which, if not"
3089,MEMORIAL.,"contemporary with, is clearly reminiscent of, the art of the shaft"
3090,MEMORIAL.,"graves. For, in the period of the first expansions (VII. 1-3 I 2),"
3091,MEMORIAL.,"the form of burial is cremation, with a barrow or tumulus. [Footnote:"
3092,MEMORIAL.,"_Ibid_., vol. ii. p. xi. and pp. 606, 607.] Thus Mr. Leaf's opinion"
3093,MEMORIAL.,might lead us to the conclusion that the usual Homeric form of burial
3094,MEMORIAL.,occurs in a period _PRIOR_ to an age in which the poet is apparently
3095,MEMORIAL.,reminiscent of the work of two early epochs--the epoch of shaft graves
3096,MEMORIAL.,"and that of _THOLOS_ graves. If this be so, cremation and urn burial in"
3097,MEMORIAL.,"cairns may be nearly as old as the Mycenaean shaft graves, or as old"
3098,MEMORIAL.,"as the _THOLOS_ graves, and they endure into the age of the latest"
3099,MEMORIAL.,expansions.
3100,MEMORIAL.,
3101,MEMORIAL.,"We must not press, however, opinions founded on the apparent technical"
3102,MEMORIAL.,resemblance of the free style and coloured metal work on the shield of
3103,MEMORIAL.,"Achilles, to the coloured metal work and free design on the daggers"
3104,MEMORIAL.,of the Mycenaean shaft graves. It is enough for us to note that the
3105,MEMORIAL.,"passages concerning burial, from the ""kernel"" itself, and also from the"
3106,MEMORIAL.,"earliest to the latest expansions, are all perfectly harmonious, and of"
3107,MEMORIAL.,a single age--unless we are convinced by Helbig's objections. That age
3108,MEMORIAL.,"must have been brief, indeed, for, before it arrives, the period of"
3109,MEMORIAL.,"_tholos_ graves, as at Vaphio, must expire, on one hand, while the"
3110,MEMORIAL.,"blending of cremation with inhumation, in the Dipylon age, must have"
3111,MEMORIAL.,"been evolved after the cremation age passed, on the other. That brief"
3112,MEMORIAL.,"intervening age, however, was the age of the _ILIAD_ and Odyssey. This"
3113,MEMORIAL.,"conclusion can only be avoided by alleging that late poets, however"
3114,MEMORIAL.,"recent and revolutionary, carefully copied the oldest epic model of"
3115,MEMORIAL.,"burial, while they innovated in almost every other point, so we are"
3116,MEMORIAL.,told. We can go no further till we find an unrifled cairn burial
3117,MEMORIAL.,"answering to Homeric descriptions. We have, indeed, in Thessaly, ""a"
3118,MEMORIAL.,"large tumulus which contained a silver urn with burned remains."" But"
3119,MEMORIAL.,the accompanying pottery dated it in the second century B.C. [Footnote:
3120,MEMORIAL.,"Ridgeway, _Early Age Of Greece_, vol. i. p. 491; _Journal of Hellenic"
3121,MEMORIAL.,"Studies, vol. xx_. pp. 20-25.] It is possible enough that all tumuli of"
3122,MEMORIAL.,the Homeric period have been robbed by grave plunderers in the course
3123,MEMORIAL.,"of the ages, as the Vikings are said to have robbed the cairns of"
3124,MEMORIAL.,"Sutherlandshire, in which they were not likely to find a rich reward"
3125,MEMORIAL.,for their labours. A conspicuous howe invites robbery--the heroes of the
3126,MEMORIAL.,"Saga, like Grettir, occasionally rob a howe--and the fact is unlucky for"
3127,MEMORIAL.,the Homeric archaeologist.
3128,MEMORIAL.,
3129,MEMORIAL.,"We have now tried to show that, as regards (1) to the absence from"
3130,MEMORIAL.,"Homer of new religious and ritual ideas, or of very old ideas revived"
3131,MEMORIAL.,"in Ionia, (2) as concerns the clear conception of a loose form of"
3132,MEMORIAL.,"feudalism, with an Over-Lord, and (3) in the matter of burial, the"
3133,MEMORIAL.,"_Iliad_ and Odyssey are self-consistent, and bear the impress of a"
3134,MEMORIAL.,single and peculiar moment of culture.
3135,MEMORIAL.,
3136,MEMORIAL.,"The fact, if accepted, is incompatible with the theory that the poets"
3137,MEMORIAL.,both introduced the peculiar conditions of their own later ages and
3138,MEMORIAL.,"also, on other occasions, consciously and consistently ""archaised."" Not"
3139,MEMORIAL.,"only is such archaising inconsistent with the art of an uncritical age,"
3140,MEMORIAL.,"but a careful archaiser, with all the resources of Alexandrian criticism"
3141,MEMORIAL.,"at his command, could not archaise successfully. We refer to Quintus"
3142,MEMORIAL.,"Smyrnaeus, author of the _Post Homerica_, in fourteen books. Quintus"
3143,MEMORIAL.,does his best; but we never observe in him that _naïf_ delight in
3144,MEMORIAL.,"describing weapons and works of art, and details of law and custom which"
3145,MEMORIAL.,are so conspicuous in Homer and in other early poets. He does give us
3146,MEMORIAL.,"Penthesilea's great sword, with a hilt of ivory and silver; but of what"
3147,MEMORIAL.,"metal was the blade? We are not told, and the reader of Quintus will"
3148,MEMORIAL.,"observe that, though he knows [Greek: chalkos], bronze, as a synonym"
3149,MEMORIAL.,"for weapons, he scarcely ever, if ever, says that a sword or spear or"
3150,MEMORIAL.,arrow-head was of bronze--a point on which Homer constantly insists.
3151,MEMORIAL.,When he names the military metal Quintus usually speaks of iron. He has
3152,MEMORIAL.,"no interest in the constitutional and legal sides of heroic life, so"
3153,MEMORIAL.,attractive to Homer.
3154,MEMORIAL.,
3155,MEMORIAL.,"Yet Quintus consciously archaises, in a critical age, with Homer as"
3156,MEMORIAL.,his model. Any one who believes that in an uncritical age rhapsodists
3157,MEMORIAL.,"archaised, with such success as the presumed late poets of the _ILIAD_"
3158,MEMORIAL.,"must have done, may try his hand in our critical age, at a ballad in the"
3159,MEMORIAL.,style of the Border ballads. If he succeeds in producing nothing that
3160,MEMORIAL.,"will at once mark his work as modern, he will be more successful than"
3161,MEMORIAL.,"any poet who has made the experiment, and more successful than the most"
3162,MEMORIAL.,"ingenious modern forgers of gems, jewels, and terra-cottas. They seldom"
3163,MEMORIAL.,"deceive experts, and, when they do, other experts detect the deceit."

3173,HOMERIC ARMOUR,"Tested by their ideas, their picture of political society, and their"
3174,HOMERIC ARMOUR,"descriptions of burial rites, the presumed authors of the alleged"
3175,HOMERIC ARMOUR,expansions of the _Iliad_ all lived in one and the same period of
3176,HOMERIC ARMOUR,"culture. But, according to the prevalent critical theory, we read in"
3177,HOMERIC ARMOUR,"the _Iliad_ not only large ""expansions"" of many dates, but also briefer"
3178,HOMERIC ARMOUR,"interpolations inserted by the strolling reciters or rhapsodists. ""Until"
3179,HOMERIC ARMOUR,"the final literary redaction had come,"" says Mr. Leaf--that is about 540"
3180,HOMERIC ARMOUR,"B.C.--""we cannot feel sure that any details, even of the oldest work,"

3182,HOMERIC ARMOUR,"_Iliad_, vol. ii. p. ix.]"
3183,HOMERIC ARMOUR,
3184,HOMERIC ARMOUR,"Here we are far from Mr. Leaf's own opinion that ""the whole scenery of"
3185,HOMERIC ARMOUR,"the poems, the details of armour, palaces, dress, decoration ... had"
3186,HOMERIC ARMOUR,"become stereotyped, and formed a foundation which the Epic poet dared"
3187,HOMERIC ARMOUR,"not intentionally sap...."" [Footnote: _Ibid_., vol. i. p. xv.] We now"
3188,HOMERIC ARMOUR,"find [Footnote: _Ibid_., vol. ii. p. ix.] that ""the latest poet"" saps"
3189,HOMERIC ARMOUR,as much as he pleases down to the middle of the sixth century B.C.
3190,HOMERIC ARMOUR,"Moreover, in the middle of the sixth century B.C., the supposed"
3191,HOMERIC ARMOUR,"editor employed by Hsistratus made ""constant additions of transitional"
3192,HOMERIC ARMOUR,"passages,"" and added many speeches by Nestor, an ancestor of"

3195,HOMERIC ARMOUR,"Did these very late interlopers, down to the sixth century, introduce"
3196,HOMERIC ARMOUR,modern details into the picture of life? did they blur the _unus_ color?
3197,HOMERIC ARMOUR,"We hope to prove that, if they did so at all, it was but slightly. That"
3198,HOMERIC ARMOUR,"the poems, however, with a Mycenaean or sub-Mycenaean basis of actual"
3199,HOMERIC ARMOUR,"custom and usage, contain numerous contaminations from the usage of"
3200,HOMERIC ARMOUR,"centuries as late as the seventh, is the view of Mr. Leaf, and Reichel"
3201,HOMERIC ARMOUR,and his followers. [Footnote: Homerische Waffen. Von Wolfgang Reichel.
3202,HOMERIC ARMOUR,"Wien, 1901.]"
3203,HOMERIC ARMOUR,
3204,HOMERIC ARMOUR,Reichel's hypothesis is that the heroes of the original poet had no
3205,HOMERIC ARMOUR,defensive armour except the great Mycenaean shields; that the ponderous
3206,HOMERIC ARMOUR,"shield made the use of chariots imperatively necessary; that, after the"
3207,HOMERIC ARMOUR,"Mycenaean age, a small buckler and a corslet superseded the unwieldy"
3208,HOMERIC ARMOUR,"shield; that chariots were no longer used; that, by the seventh century"
3209,HOMERIC ARMOUR,"B.C., a warrior could not be thought of without a breastplate; and that"
3210,HOMERIC ARMOUR,new poets thrust corslets and greaves into songs both new and old.
3211,HOMERIC ARMOUR,
3212,HOMERIC ARMOUR,"How the new poets could conceive of warriors as always in chariots,"
3213,HOMERIC ARMOUR,"whereas in practice they knew no war chariots, and yet could not"
3214,HOMERIC ARMOUR,"conceive of them without corslets which the original poet never saw, is"
3215,HOMERIC ARMOUR,Reichel's secret. The new poets had in the old lays a plain example to
3216,HOMERIC ARMOUR,follow. They did follow it as to chariots and shields; as to corslets
3217,HOMERIC ARMOUR,and greaves they reversed it. Such is the Reichelian theory.
3218,HOMERIC ARMOUR,
3219,THE SHIELD,THE SHIELD
3220,THE SHIELD,
3221,THE SHIELD,"As regards armour, controversy is waged over the shield, corslet, and"
3222,THE SHIELD,"bronze greaves. In Homer the shield is of leather, plated with bronze,"
3223,THE SHIELD,and of bronze is the corslet. No shields of bronze plating and no bronze
3224,THE SHIELD,corslets have been found in Mycenaean excavations.
3225,THE SHIELD,
3226,THE SHIELD,"We have to ask, do the Homeric descriptions of shields tally with the"
3227,THE SHIELD,"representations of shields in works of art, discovered in the graves"
3228,THE SHIELD,"of Mycenae, Spata in Attica, Vaphio in Sparta, and elsewhere? If the"
3229,THE SHIELD,"descriptions in Homer vary from these relics, to what extent do they"
3230,THE SHIELD,vary? and do the differences arise from the fact that the poet describes
3231,THE SHIELD,"consistently what he sees in his own age, or are the variations caused"
3232,THE SHIELD,"by late rhapsodists in the Iron Age, who keep the great obsolete shields"
3233,THE SHIELD,"and bronze weapons, yet introduce the other military gear of their day,"
3234,THE SHIELD,say 800-600 B.C.--gear unknown to the early singers?
3235,THE SHIELD,
3236,THE SHIELD,"It may be best to inquire, first, what does the poet, or what do"
3237,THE SHIELD,"the poets, say about shields? and, next, to examine the evidence of"
3238,THE SHIELD,representations of shields in Mycenaean art; always remembering that the
3239,THE SHIELD,"poet does not pretend to live, and beyond all doubt does not live, in"
3240,THE SHIELD,"the Mycenaean prime, and that the testimony of the tombs is liable to be"
3241,THE SHIELD,altered by fresh discoveries.
3242,THE SHIELD,
3243,THE SHIELD,"In _Iliad_, II. 388, the shield (_aspis_) is spoken of as ""covering a"
3244,THE SHIELD,"man about"" ([Greek: _amphibrotae_]), while, in the heat of battle, the"
3245,THE SHIELD,"baldric (_telamon_), or belt of the shield, ""shall be wet with sweat."""
3246,THE SHIELD,"The shield, then, is not an Ionian buckler worn on the left arm, but is"
3247,THE SHIELD,"suspended by a belt, and covers a man, or most of him, just as Mycenaean"
3248,THE SHIELD,"shields are suspended by belts shown in works of art, and cover the"
3249,THE SHIELD,body and legs. This (II. 388) is a general description applying to the
3250,THE SHIELD,shields of all men who fight from chariots. Their great shield answers
3251,THE SHIELD,"to the great mediaeval shield of the knights of the twelfth century, the"
3252,THE SHIELD,"""double targe,"" worn suspended from the neck by a belt. Such a shield"
3253,THE SHIELD,covers a mounted knight's body from mouth to stirrup in an ivory
3254,THE SHIELD,"chessman of the eleventh to twelfth century A.D., [Footnote: _Catalogue"
3255,THE SHIELD,"of Scottish National Antiquities_, p. 375.] so also in the Bayeux"
3256,THE SHIELD,"tapestry, [Footnote: Gautier, _Chanson de Roland_. Seventh edition, pp."
3257,THE SHIELD,"393, 394.] and on seals. Dismounted men have the same shield (p. 132)."
3258,THE SHIELD,
3259,THE SHIELD,"The shield of Menelaus (III. 348) is ""equal in all directions,"" which we"
3260,THE SHIELD,"might conceive to mean, mathematically ""circular,"" as the words do mean"
3261,THE SHIELD,"that. A shield is said to have ""circles,"" and a spear which grazes"
3262,THE SHIELD,"a shield--a shield which was _[Greek: panton eesae]_, ""every way"
3263,THE SHIELD,"equal""--rends both circles, the outer circle of bronze, and the inner"
3264,THE SHIELD,"circle of leather (_Iliad_, XX. 273-281). But the passage is not"
3265,THE SHIELD,unjustly believed to be late; and we cannot rely on it as proof
3266,THE SHIELD,that Homer knew circular shields among others. The epithet _[Greek:
3267,THE SHIELD,"eukuklykos]_, ""of good circle,"" is commonly given to the shields, but"
3268,THE SHIELD,"does not mean that the shield was circular, we are told, but merely that"
3269,THE SHIELD,"it was ""made of circular plates."" [Footnote: Leaf, _Iliad_, vol. i. p."
3270,THE SHIELD,"573.] As for the shield of Menelaus, and other shields described in the"
3271,THE SHIELD,"same words, ""every way equal,"" the epithet is not now allowed to mean"
3272,THE SHIELD,"""circular."" Mr. Leaf, annotating _Iliad_, I. 306, says that this sense"
3273,THE SHIELD,"is ""intolerably mathematical and prosaic,"" and translates _[Greek:"
3274,THE SHIELD,"panton eesae]_ as ""well balanced on every side."" Helbig renders the"
3275,THE SHIELD,"epithets in the natural sense, as ""circular."" [Footnote: Helbig,"
3276,THE SHIELD,"_Homerische Epos_, p. 315; cf., on the other hand, p. 317, Note I.]"
3277,THE SHIELD,
3278,THE SHIELD,"To the rendering ""circular"" it is objected that a circular shield of,"
3279,THE SHIELD,"say, four feet and a half in diameter, would be intolerably heavy and"
3280,THE SHIELD,"superfluously wide, while the shields represented in Mycenaean art are"
3281,THE SHIELD,"not circles, but rather resemble a figure of eight, in some cases, or a"
3282,THE SHIELD,"section of a cylinder, in others, or, again, a door (Fig. 5, p. 130)."
3283,THE SHIELD,
3284,THE SHIELD,"What Homer really meant by such epithets as ""equal every way,"" ""very"
3285,THE SHIELD,"circular,"" ""of a good circle,"" cannot be ascertained, since Homeric"
3286,THE SHIELD,"epithets of the shield, which were previously rendered ""circular,"" ""of"
3287,THE SHIELD,"good circle,"" and so on, are now translated in quite other senses, in"
3288,THE SHIELD,order that Homeric descriptions may be made to tally with Mycenaean
3289,THE SHIELD,"representations of shields, which are never circular as represented in"
3290,THE SHIELD,works of art. In this position of affairs we are unable to determine the
3291,THE SHIELD,"shape, or shapes, of the shields known to Homer."
3292,THE SHIELD,
3293,THE SHIELD,A scholar's rendering of Homer's epithets applied to the shield is
3294,THE SHIELD,obliged to vary with the variations of his theory about the shield.
3295,THE SHIELD,"Thus, in 1883, Mr. Leaf wrote, ""The poet often calls the shield by names"
3296,THE SHIELD,"which seem to imply that it was round, and yet indicates that it was"
3297,THE SHIELD,large enough to cover the whole body of a man.... In descriptions the
3298,THE SHIELD,"round shape is always implied."" The words which indicated that the"
3299,THE SHIELD,"shield (or one shield) ""really looked like a tower, and really reached"
3300,THE SHIELD,"from neck to ankles"" (in two or three cases), were ""received by the poet"
3301,THE SHIELD,"from the earlier Achaean lays."" ""But to Homer the warriors appeared as"
3302,THE SHIELD,using the later small round shield. His belief in the heroic strength of
3303,THE SHIELD,the men of old time made it quite natural to speak of them as bearing
3304,THE SHIELD,a shield which at once combined the later circular shape and the old
3305,THE SHIELD,"heroic expanse...."" [Footnote: _Journal of Hellenic Studies, iv. pp._"
3306,THE SHIELD,283-285.]
3307,THE SHIELD,
3308,THE SHIELD,"Here the Homeric words which naturally mean ""circular"" or ""round"" are"
3309,THE SHIELD,"accepted as meaning ""round"" or ""circular."" Homer, it is supposed, in"
3310,THE SHIELD,"practice only knows the round shields of the later age, 700 B.C., so he"
3311,THE SHIELD,"calls shields ""round,"" but, obedient to tradition, he conceives of them"
3312,THE SHIELD,as very large.
3313,THE SHIELD,
3314,THE SHIELD,"But, after the appearance of Reichel's speculations, the Homeric words"
3315,THE SHIELD,"for ""round"" and ""circular"" have been explained as meaning something"
3316,THE SHIELD,"else, and Mr. Leaf, in place of maintaining that Homer knew no shields"
3317,THE SHIELD,"but round shields, now writes (1900), ""The small circular shield of"
3318,THE SHIELD,"later times...is equally unknown to Homer, with a very few curious"
3319,THE SHIELD,"exceptions,"" which Reichel discovered--erroneously, as we shall later"
3320,THE SHIELD,"try to show. [Footnote: Leaf, _Iliad_, vol. i. p. 575.]"
3321,THE SHIELD,
3322,THE SHIELD,Thus does science fluctuate! Now Homer knows in practice none but light
3323,THE SHIELD,"round bucklers, dating from about 700 B.C.; again, he does not know"
3324,THE SHIELD,"them at all, though they were habitually used in the period at which"
3325,THE SHIELD,"the later parts of his Epic were composed. We shall have to ask, how"
3326,THE SHIELD,did small round bucklers come to be unknown to late poets who saw them
3327,THE SHIELD,constantly?
3328,THE SHIELD,
3329,THE SHIELD,"Some scholars, then, believe that the old original poet always described"
3330,THE SHIELD,"Mycenaean shields, which are of various shapes, but never circular in"
3331,THE SHIELD,"Mycenaean art. If there are any circular shields in the poems, these,"
3332,THE SHIELD,"they say, must have been introduced by poets accustomed, in a much later"
3333,THE SHIELD,"age, to seeing circular bucklers. Therefore Homeric words, hitherto"
3334,THE SHIELD,"understood as meaning ""circular,"" must now mean something else--even if"
3335,THE SHIELD,the reasoning seems circular.
3336,THE SHIELD,
3337,THE SHIELD,Other scholars believe that the poet in real life saw various types of
3338,THE SHIELD,"shields in use, and that some of them were survivals of the Mycenaean"
3339,THE SHIELD,"shields, semi-cylindrical, or shaped like figures of 8, or like a"
3340,THE SHIELD,door; others were circular; and these scholars presume that Homer meant
3341,THE SHIELD,"""circular"" when he said ""circular."" Neither school will convert the"
3342,THE SHIELD,"other, and we cannot decide between them. We do not pretend to be"
3343,THE SHIELD,"certain as to whether the original poet saw shields of various types,"
3344,THE SHIELD,"including the round shape, in use, though that is possible, or whether"
3345,THE SHIELD,he saw only the Mycenaean types.
3346,THE SHIELD,
3347,THE SHIELD,"As regards size, Homer certainly describes, in several cases, shields"
3348,THE SHIELD,very much larger than most which we know for certain to have been common
3349,THE SHIELD,"after, say, 700 B.C. He speaks of shields reaching from neck to ankles,"
3350,THE SHIELD,"and ""covering the body of a man about."" Whether he was also familiar"
3351,THE SHIELD,with smaller shields of various types is uncertain; he does not
3352,THE SHIELD,"explicitly say that any small bucklers were used by the chiefs, nor"
3353,THE SHIELD,does he explicitly say that all shields were of the largest type. It is
3354,THE SHIELD,possible that at the time when the Epic was composed various types of
3355,THE SHIELD,"shield were being tried, while the vast ancient shield was far from"
3356,THE SHIELD,obsolete.
3357,THE SHIELD,
3358,THE SHIELD,To return to the _size_ of the shield. In a feigned tale of Odysseus
3359,THE SHIELD,"(Odyssey, XIV. 474-477), men in a wintry ambush place their shields over"
3360,THE SHIELD,"their shoulders, as they lie on the ground, to be a protection against"
3361,THE SHIELD,"snow. But any sort of shield, large or small, would protect the"
3362,THE SHIELD,shoulders of men in a recumbent position. Quite a large shield may seem
3363,THE SHIELD,"to be indicated in _Iliad_, XIII. 400-405, where Idomeneus curls up his"
3364,THE SHIELD,"whole person behind his shield; he was ""hidden"" by it. Yet, as any"
3365,THE SHIELD,"one can see by experiment, a man who crouched low would be protected"
3366,THE SHIELD,"entirely by a Highland targe of less than thirty inches in diameter, so"
3367,THE SHIELD,nothing about the size of the shield is ascertained in this passage. On
3368,THE SHIELD,"a black-figured vase in the British Museum (B, 325) the entire body of"
3369,THE SHIELD,"a crouching warrior is defended by a large Boeotian buckler, oval, and"
3370,THE SHIELD,"with _échancrures_ in the sides. The same remark applies to _Z&ad_[sic],"
3371,THE SHIELD,XXII. 273-275. Hector watches the spear of Achilles as it flies; he
3372,THE SHIELD,"crouches, and the spear flies over him. Robert takes this as an ""old"
3373,THE SHIELD,"Mycenaean"" dodge--to duck down to the bottom of the shield. [Footnote:"
3374,THE SHIELD,"_Studien zur Ilias_, p. 21.] The avoidance by ducking can be managed"
3375,THE SHIELD,"with no shield, or with a common Highland targe, which would cover a"
3376,THE SHIELD,"man in a crouching posture, as when Glenbucket's targe was peppered by"
3377,THE SHIELD,"bullets at Clifton (746), and Cluny shouted ""What the devil is this?"""
3378,THE SHIELD,the assailants firing unexpectedly from a ditch. A few moments of
3379,THE SHIELD,"experiment, we repeat, prove that a round targe can protect a man in"
3380,THE SHIELD,"Hector's attitude, and that the Homeric texts here throw no light on the"
3381,THE SHIELD,_size_ of the shield.
3382,THE SHIELD,
3383,THE SHIELD,"The shield of Hector was of black bull's-hide, and as large and long as"
3384,THE SHIELD,"any represented in Mycenaean art, so that, as he walked, the rim knocked"
3385,THE SHIELD,against his neck and ankles. The shape is not mentioned. Despite its
3386,THE SHIELD,"size, he _walked_ under it from the plain and field of battle into Troy"
3387,THE SHIELD,"(_Iliad_, VI. 116-118). This must be remembered, as Reichel [Footnote:"
3388,THE SHIELD,"Reichel, 38, 39. Father Browne (_Handbook_, p. 230) writes, ""In"
3389,THE SHIELD,"_Odyssey_, XIV 475, Odysseus says he slept within the shield."" He says"
3390,THE SHIELD,"""under arms"" (_Odyssey_, XIV. 474, but _cf_. XIV. 479).] maintains that"
3391,THE SHIELD,"a man could not walk under shield, or only for a short way; wherefore"
3392,THE SHIELD,"the war chariot was invented, he says, to carry the fighting man from"
3393,THE SHIELD,"point to point (Leaf, _Iliad_, vol. i. p. 573). Mr. Leaf elaborates"
3394,THE SHIELD,"these points: ""Why did not the Homeric heroes ride? Because no man could"
3395,THE SHIELD,"carry such a shield on horseback."" [Footnote: _Iliad_, vol. i. p. 573.]"
3396,THE SHIELD,"We reply that men could and did carry such shields on horseback, as"
3397,THE SHIELD,we know on the evidence of works of art and poetry of the eleventh to
3398,THE SHIELD,twelfth centuries A.D. Mr. Ridgeway has explained the introduction
3399,THE SHIELD,of chariots as the result of horses too small to carry a heavy and
3400,THE SHIELD,heavily-armed man as a cavalier.
3401,THE SHIELD,
3402,THE SHIELD,"The shield ([Greek: aspis]), we are told by followers of Reichel, was"
3403,THE SHIELD,"only worn by princes who could afford to keep chariots, charioteers,"
3404,THE SHIELD,and squires of the body to arm and disarm them. But this can scarcely
3405,THE SHIELD,"be true, for all the comrades of Diomede had the shield ([Greek: aspis],"
3406,THE SHIELD,"_Iliad_, X. 152), and the whole host of Pandarus of Troy, a noted"
3407,THE SHIELD,"bowman, were shield-bearers ([Greek: aspistaon laon], _Iliad_, IV."
3408,THE SHIELD,"90), and some of them held their shields ([Greek: sakae]) in front of"
3409,THE SHIELD,Pandarus when he took a treacherous shot at Menelaus (IV. 113). The
3410,THE SHIELD,"whole host could not have chariots and squires, we may presume, so the"
3411,THE SHIELD,chariot was not indispensable to the _écuyer_ or shield-bearing man.
3412,THE SHIELD,
3413,THE SHIELD,"The objections to this conjecture of Reichel are conspicuous, as we now"
3414,THE SHIELD,prove.
3415,THE SHIELD,
3416,THE SHIELD,No Mycenaean work of art shows us a shielded man in a chariot; the men
3417,THE SHIELD,with the monstrous shields are always depicted on foot. The only modern
3418,THE SHIELD,"peoples who, to our knowledge, used a leather shield of the Mycenaean"
3419,THE SHIELD,"size and even of a Mycenaean shape had no horses and chariots, as"
3420,THE SHIELD,"we shall show. The ancient Eastern peoples, such as the Khita and"
3421,THE SHIELD,"Egyptians, who fought from chariots, carried _small_ shields of various"
3422,THE SHIELD,"forms, as in the well-known picture of a battle between the Khita, armed"
3423,THE SHIELD,"with spears, and the bowmen of Rameses II, who kill horse and man with"
3424,THE SHIELD,"arrows from their chariots, and carry no spears; while the Khita, who"
3425,THE SHIELD,"have no bows, merely spears, are shot down as they advance. [Footnote:"
3426,THE SHIELD,"Maspero, _Hist. Ancienne_, ii. p. 225.]. Egyptians and Khita, who fight"
3427,THE SHIELD,"from chariots, use _small_ bucklers, whence it follows that war chariots"
3428,THE SHIELD,"were not invented, or, at least, were not retained in use, for the"
3429,THE SHIELD,"purpose of giving mobility to men wearing gigantic shields, under which"
3430,THE SHIELD,they could not hurry from point to point. War chariots did not cease to
3431,THE SHIELD,"be used in Egypt, when men used small shields."
3432,THE SHIELD,
3433,THE SHIELD,"Moreover, Homeric warriors can make marches under shield, while there is"
3434,THE SHIELD,no mention of chariots to carry them to the point where they are to
3435,THE SHIELD,"lie in ambush (Odyssey, XIV. 470-510). If the shield was so heavy as"
3436,THE SHIELD,"to render a chariot necessary, would Homer make Hector trudge a"
3437,THE SHIELD,"considerable distance under shield, while Achilles, under shield,"
3438,THE SHIELD,sprints thrice round the whole circumference of Troy? Helbig notices
3439,THE SHIELD,"several other cases of long runs under shield. Either Reichel is wrong,"
3440,THE SHIELD,when he said that the huge shield made the use of the war chariot
3441,THE SHIELD,"necessary, or the poet is ""late""; he is a man who never saw a large"
3442,THE SHIELD,"shield like Hector's, and, though he speaks of such shields, he thinks"
3443,THE SHIELD,that men could walk and run under them. When men did walk or run under
3444,THE SHIELD,"shield, or ride, if they ever rode, they would hang it over the left"
3445,THE SHIELD,"side, like the lion-hunters on the famous inlaid dagger of Mycenae,"
3446,THE SHIELD,"[Footnote: For the chariots, _cf_. Reichel, _Homerische Waffen_,"
3447,THE SHIELD,"120_ff_. Wien, 1901.] or the warrior on the chessman referred to above"
3448,THE SHIELD,(p. 111).
3449,THE SHIELD,
3450,THE SHIELD,"Aias, again, the big, brave, stupid Porthos of the _Iliad_, has the"
3451,THE SHIELD,"largest shield of all, ""like a tower"" (this shield cannot have been"
3452,THE SHIELD,"circular), and is recognised by his shield. But he never enters a"
3453,THE SHIELD,"chariot, and, like Odysseus, has none of his own, because both men come"
3454,THE SHIELD,"from rugged islands, unfit for chariot driving. Odysseus has plenty"
3455,THE SHIELD,"of shields in his house in Ithaca, as we learn from the account of the"
3456,THE SHIELD,"battle with the Wooers in the _Odyssey;_ yet, in Ithaca, as at Troy, he"
3457,THE SHIELD,"kept no chariot. Here, then, we have nations who fight from chariots,"
3458,THE SHIELD,"yet use small shields, and heroes who wear enormous shields, yet never"
3459,THE SHIELD,"own a chariot. Clearly, the great shield cannot have been the cause of"
3460,THE SHIELD,"the use of the war chariot, as in the theory of Reichel."
3461,THE SHIELD,
3462,THE SHIELD,"Aias and his shield we meet in _Iliad_, VII. 206-220. ""He clothed"
3463,THE SHIELD,"himself upon his flesh in _all_ his armour"" ([Greek: teuchea]), to quote"
3464,THE SHIELD,Mr. Leaf's translation; but the poet only _describes_ his shield:
3465,THE SHIELD,"his ""towerlike shield of bronze, with sevenfold ox-hide, that Tychius"
3466,THE SHIELD,"wrought him cunningly; Tychius, the best of curriers, that had his home"
3467,THE SHIELD,"in Hyle, who made for him his glancing shield of sevenfold hides of"
3468,THE SHIELD,"stalwart bulls, and overlaid the seven with bronze."""
3469,THE SHIELD,
3470,THE SHIELD,"The shield known to Homer then is, in this case, so tall as to resemble"
3471,THE SHIELD,"a tower, and has bronze plating over bull's hide. By tradition from an"
3472,THE SHIELD,"age of leather shields the Currier is still the shield-maker, though now"
3473,THE SHIELD,the shield has metal plating. It is fairly clear that Greek tradition
3474,THE SHIELD,regarded the shield of Aias as of the kind which covered the body from
3475,THE SHIELD,"chin to ankles, and resembled a bellying sail, or an umbrella unfurled,"
3476,THE SHIELD,"and drawn in at the sides in the middle, so as to offer the semblance"
3477,THE SHIELD,"of two bellies, or of one, pinched in at or near the centre. This is"
3478,THE SHIELD,"probable, because the coins of Salamis, where Aias was worshipped as a"
3479,THE SHIELD,"local hero of great influence, display this shield as the badge of the"
3480,THE SHIELD,"AEginetan dynasty, claiming descent from Aias. The shield is bossed,"
3481,THE SHIELD,"or bellied out, with two half-moons cut in the centre, representing the"
3482,THE SHIELD,"_waist_, or pinched--in part, of the ancient Mycenaean shield; the same"
3483,THE SHIELD,device occurs on a Mycenaean ring from AEgina in the British Museum.
3484,THE SHIELD,"[Footnote: Evans, _Journal of Hellenic Studies_, xiii. 213-216.]"
3485,THE SHIELD,
3486,THE SHIELD,In a duel with Aias the spear of Hector pierced the bronze and six
3487,THE SHIELD,"layers of hide on his shield, but stuck in the seventh. The spear of"
3488,THE SHIELD,"Aias went through the circular (or ""every way balanced"") huge shield"
3489,THE SHIELD,"of Hector, and through his corslet and _chiton_, but Hector had doubled"
3490,THE SHIELD,"himself up laterally ([Greek: eklinthae], VII. 254), and was not"
3491,THE SHIELD,"wounded. The next stroke of Aias pierced his shield, and wounded his"
3492,THE SHIELD,neck; Hector replied with a boulder that lighted on the centre of the
3493,THE SHIELD,"shield of Aias, ""on the boss,"" whether that means a mere ornament or"
3494,THE SHIELD,"knob, or whether it was the genuine boss--which is disputed. Aias broke"
3495,THE SHIELD,in the shield of Hector with another stone; and the gentle and joyous
3496,THE SHIELD,passage of arms was stopped.
3497,THE SHIELD,
3498,THE SHIELD,"The shield of Agamemnon was of the kind that ""cover all the body of"
3499,THE SHIELD,"a man,"" and was ""every way equal,"" or ""circular."" It was plated"
3500,THE SHIELD,"with twelve circles of bronze, and had twenty [Greek: omphaloi], or"
3501,THE SHIELD,"ornamental knobs of tin, and the centre was of black cyanus (XI."
3502,THE SHIELD,"31-34). There was also a head of the Gorgon, with Fear and Panic. The"
3503,THE SHIELD,"description is not intelligible, and I do not discuss it."
3504,THE SHIELD,
3505,THE SHIELD,"A man could be stabbed in the middle of the belly, ""under his shield"""
3506,THE SHIELD,"(XI. 424-425), not an easy thing to do, if shields covered the whole"
3507,THE SHIELD,"body to the feet; but, when a hero was leaping from his chariot (as in"
3508,THE SHIELD,"this case), no doubt a spear could be pushed up under the shield."
3509,THE SHIELD,"The ancient Irish romances tell of a _gae bulg_, a spear held in the"
3510,THE SHIELD,"warrior's toes, and jerked up under the shield of his enemy! Shields"
3511,THE SHIELD,"could be held up on high, in an attack on a wall garrisoned by archers"
3512,THE SHIELD,"(XII. 139), the great Norman shield, also, could be thus lifted."
3513,THE SHIELD,
3514,THE SHIELD,"The Locrians, light armed infantry, had no shields, nor bronze helmets,"
3515,THE SHIELD,"nor spears, but slings and bows (XIII. 714). Mr. Leaf suspects that this"
3516,THE SHIELD,"is a piece of ""false archaism,"" but we do not think that early poets"
3517,THE SHIELD,"in an uncritical age are ever archaeologists, good or bad. The poet is"
3518,THE SHIELD,"aware that some men have larger, some smaller shields, just as some have"
3519,THE SHIELD,longer and some shorter spears (XIV. 370-377); but this does not prove
3520,THE SHIELD,that the shields were of different types. A tall man might inherit the
3521,THE SHIELD,"shield of a short father, or _versa_."
3522,THE SHIELD,
3523,THE SHIELD,"A man in turning to fly might trip on the rim of his shield, which"
3524,THE SHIELD,"proves how large it was: ""it reached to his feet."" This accident of"
3525,THE SHIELD,"tripping occurred to Periphetes of Mycenae, but it might have happened"
3526,THE SHIELD,"to Hector, whose shield reached from neck to ankles. [Footnote: _Iliad_,"

3544,XV. 645-646.],is being rowed to the attack of a ship. On the raised deck of the
3545,XV. 645-646.],"galley stand three warriors, helmeted and bearing spears. The artist has"
3546,XV. 645-646.],"represented their shields as covering their right sides, probably for"
3547,XV. 645-646.],the purpose of showing their devices or blazons. _Their_ shields are
3548,XV. 645-646.],"small round bucklers. On the ship are three warriors whose shields,"
3549,XV. 645-646.],"though circular, _cover THE BODY from CHIN TO ANKLES_, as in Homer. One"
3550,XV. 645-646.],shield bears a bull's head; the next has three crosses; the third blazon
3551,XV. 645-646.],"is a crab. [Footnote: Mon. _dell_. Inst., is. pl. 4.]"
3552,XV. 645-646.],
3553,XV. 645-646.],Such personal armorial bearings are never mentioned by Homer. It is

3555,XV. 645-646.],"anything. He never mentions seals or signet rings, yet they cannot but"
3556,XV. 645-646.],have been familiar to his time. Odysseus does not seal the chest with
3557,XV. 645-646.],the Phaeacian presents; he ties it up with a cunning knot; there are
3558,XV. 645-646.],"no rings named among the things wrought by Hephaestus, nor among the"

3565,XV. 645-646.],appear again in the earliest dawn of the classical age and in a Cyclic
3566,XV. 645-646.],"poem, it is plain that all the expansionists lived in one, and that a"
3567,XV. 645-646.],"most peculiar _ringless_ age. This view suits our argument to a wish,"
3568,XV. 645-646.],"but it is not credible that rings and seals and engraved stones, so very"
3569,XV. 645-646.],"common in Mycenaean and later times, should have vanished wholly in the"
3570,XV. 645-646.],"Homeric time. The poet never mentions them, just as Shakespeare never"
3571,XV. 645-646.],mentions a thing so familiar to him as tobacco. How often are finger
3572,XV. 645-646.],rings mentioned in the whole mass of Attic tragic poetry? We remember no
3573,XV. 645-646.],"example, and instances are certainly rare: Liddell and Scott give none."
3574,XV. 645-646.],"Yet the tragedians were, of course, familiar with rings and seals."
3575,XV. 645-646.],
3576,XV. 645-646.],"Manifestly, we cannot say that Homer knew no seals, because he mentions"

3579,XV. 645-646.],
3580,XV. 645-646.],"Meanwhile, the shields of the warriors on the vase, being circular and"
3581,XV. 645-646.],"covering body and legs, answer most closely to Homer's descriptions."
3582,XV. 645-646.],"Helbig is reduced to suggest, first, that these shields are worn by men"
3583,XV. 645-646.],"aboard ship, as if warriors had one sort of shield when aboard ship and"
3584,XV. 645-646.],"another when fighting on land, and as if the men in the other vessel"
3585,XV. 645-646.],were not equally engaged in a sea fight. No evidence in favour of such
3586,XV. 645-646.],"difference of practice, by sea and land, is offered. Again, Helbig does"
3587,XV. 645-646.],"not trust the artist, in this case, though the artist is usually trusted"
3588,XV. 645-646.],to draw what he sees; and why should he give the men in the other ship
3589,XV. 645-646.],"or boat small bucklers, genuine, while bedecking the warriors in the"
3590,XV. 645-646.],"adverse vessel with large, purely imaginary shields? [Footnote:"
3591,XV. 645-646.],"Helbig, _Das Homerische Epos_, ii. pp. 313-314.] It is not in the least"
3592,XV. 645-646.],"""probable,"" as Helbig suggests, that the artist is shirking the trouble"

3594,XV. 645-646.],
3595,XV. 645-646.],Reichel supposes that round bucklers were novelties when the vase was
3596,XV. 645-646.],"painted (seventh century), and that the artist did not understand how"
3597,XV. 645-646.],"to depict them. [Footnote: _Homerische Waffen_, p. 47.] But he depicted"
3598,XV. 645-646.],"them very well as regards the men in the galley, save that, for obvious"
3599,XV. 645-646.],"aesthetic reasons, he chose to assume that the men in the galley were"
3600,XV. 645-646.],"left-handed and wore their shields on their right arms, his desire"
3601,XV. 645-646.],being to display the blazons of both parties. [Footnote: See the same
3602,XV. 645-646.],"arrangement in a Dipylon vase. Baumeister, _Denkmaler_, iii. p. 1945.]"
3603,XV. 645-646.],"We thus see, if the artist may be trusted, that shields, which both"
3604,XV. 645-646.],"""reached to the feet"" and were circular, existed in his time (the"
3605,XV. 645-646.],"seventh century), so that possibly they may have existed in Homer's"
3606,XV. 645-646.],time and survived into the age of small bucklers. Tyrtaeus (late seventh
3607,XV. 645-646.],"century), as Helbig remarks, speaks of ""a _wide_ shield, covering"
3608,XV. 645-646.],"thighs, shins, breast, and shoulders."" [Footnote: _Tyrtaeus_, xi. 23;"
3609,XV. 645-646.],"Helbig, _Das Homerische Epos_, ii. p. 315, Note 2.]"
3610,XV. 645-646.],
3611,XV. 645-646.],Nothing can be more like the large shields of the vase of Aristonothos.
3612,XV. 645-646.],Thus the huge circular shield seems to have been a practicable shield
3613,XV. 645-646.],"in actual use. If so, when Homer spoke of large circular shields he may"
3614,XV. 645-646.],have meant large circular shields. On the Dodwell pyxis of 650 to 620
3615,XV. 645-646.],"B.C., a man wears an oval shield, covering him from the base of the neck"
3616,XV. 645-646.],"to the ankles. He wears it on his left arm. [Footnote: Walters, _Ancient"
3617,XV. 645-646.],"Pottery_, p. 316.]"
3618,XV. 645-646.],
3619,XV. 645-646.],"Of shields certainly small and light, worn by the chiefs, there is not"
3620,XV. 645-646.],"a notice in the _Iliad_, unless there be a hint to that effect in"

3622,XV. 645-646.],"""stepping lightly"" under shields, supposed, by the critics, to be of"
3623,XV. 645-646.],crushing weight. In such passages the poet may be carried away by his
3624,XV. 645-646.],"own _verve_, or the heroes of ancient times may be deemed capable of"
3625,XV. 645-646.],"exertions beyond those of the poet's contemporaries, as he often tells"
3626,XV. 645-646.],"us that, in fact, the old heroes were. A poet is not a scientific"
3627,XV. 645-646.],military writer; and in the epic poetry of all other early races very
3628,XV. 645-646.],"gross exaggeration is permitted, as in the [blank space] the old Celtic"
3629,XV. 645-646.],"romances, and, of course, the huge epics of India. In Homer ""the skill"
3630,XV. 645-646.],"of the poet makes things impossible convincing,"" Aristotle says; and it"
3631,XV. 645-646.],is a critical error to insist on taking Homer absolutely and always _au
3632,XV. 645-646.],"pied de la lettre_. He seems, undeniably, to have large body-covering"
3633,XV. 645-646.],shields present to his mind as in common use.
3634,XV. 645-646.],
3635,XV. 645-646.],"Small shields of the Greek historic period are ""unknown to Homer,"" Mr."

3643,XV. 645-646.],the Mycenzean huge shield. The Zulu wooden head-rest is of the same

3895,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"as large as the Mycenaean but plated with bronze, for a reason to be"
3896,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"given later. This kind of shield, the kind known to Homer, was not the"
3897,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"invention of late poets living in an age of circular bucklers, worn on"

3908,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"Homeric shields covering the body from chin to ankles, can easily be"
3909,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,traced. The nature of the attack expected may be inferred from the
3910,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"nature of the defence employed. Body-covering shields were, obviously,"
3911,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"at first, _defences against showers of arrows_ tipped with stone. ""In"
3912,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"the earlier Mycenaean times the arrow-head of obsidian alone appears,"""
3913,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,as in Mycenaean Grave IV. In the upper strata of Mycenae and in the
3914,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,later tombs the arrow-head is usually of bronze. [Footnote: Tsountas and
3915,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"Manatt, p. 206.] No man going into battle naked, without body armour,"
3916,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"like the Mycenaeans (if they had none), could protect himself with"
3917,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"a small shield, or even with a round buckler of twenty-six inches in"
3918,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"diameter, against the rain of shafts. In a fight, on the other hand,"
3919,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"where man singled out man, and spears were the missiles, and when the"
3920,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"warriors had body armour, or even when they had not, a small"
3921,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,shield sufficed; as we see among the spear-throwing Zulus and the
3922,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,spear-throwing aborigines of Australia (unacquainted with bows and
3923,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"arrows), who mainly use shields scarcely broader than a bat. On the"
3924,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"other hand, the archers of the Algonquins in their wars with the"
3925,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"Iroquois, about 1610, used clubs and tomahawks but no spears, no"
3926,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"missiles but arrows, and their leather shield was precisely the [Greek:"
3927,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"amphibrotae aspis] of Homer, ""covering the whole of a man."" It is"
3928,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"curious to see, in contemporary drawings (1620), Mycenaean shields on"
3929,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,Red Indian shoulders!
3930,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,
3931,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,In Champlain's sketches of fights between French and Algonquins against
3932,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"Iroquois (1610-1620), we see the Algonquins outside the Iroquois"
3933,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"stockade, which is defended by archers, sheltering under huge shields"
3934,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"shaped like the Mycenaean ""tower"" shield, though less cylindrical; in"
3935,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"fact, more like the shield of the fallen hunter depicted on the dagger"
3936,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,of Mycenae. These Algonquin shields partially cover the sides as well as
3937,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"the front of the warrior, who stoops behind them, resting the lower rim"
3938,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,of the shield on the ground. The shields are oblong and rounded at the
3939,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"top, much like that of Achilles [Footnote: Iliad, vol. ii p. 605] in"
3940,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"Mr. Leaf's restoration? The sides curve inward. Another shield, oval in"
3941,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"shape and flat, appears to have been suspended from the neck, and covers"
3942,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"an Iroquois brave from chin to feet. The Red Indian shields, like those"
3943,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"of Mycenae, were made of leather; usually of buffalo hide, [Footnote:"
3944,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"_Les Voyages de Sr. de Champlain_, Paris, 1620, f. 22: ""rondache de"
3945,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"cuir bouili, qui est d'un animal, comme le boufle.""] good against"
3946,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"stone-tipped arrows. The braves are naked, like the unshielded archers"
3947,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,on the Mycenaean silver vase fragment representing a siege (Fig. 7). The
3948,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"description of the Algonquin shields by Champlain, when compared"
3949,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"with his drawings, suggests that we cannot always take artistic"
3950,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,representations as exact. In his designs only a few Algonquins and one
3951,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"Iroquois carry the huge shields; the unshielded men are stark naked, as"
3952,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,on the Mycenaean silver vase. But in his text Champlain says that the
3953,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"Iroquois, like the Algonquins, ""carried arrow-proof shields"" and ""a"
3954,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"sort of armour woven of cotton thread""--Homer's [Greek: linothoraex]"
3955,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"(_Iliad_, II. 259, 850). These facts appear in only one of Champlain's"
3956,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"drawings [Footnote: Dix's _Champlain_, p. 113. Appleton, New York, 1903."

3960,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"These Iroquois and Algonquin shields are the armour of men exposed, not"
3961,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"to spears, but to a hail of flint-tipped arrows. As spears came in for"
3962,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"missiles in Greek warfare, arrows did not wholly go out, but the noble"
3963,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"warriors preferred spear and sword. [Footnote: Cf. Archilochus, 3.] Mr."
3964,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"Ridgeway erroneously says that ""no Achaean warrior employs the bow for"

3966,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"Meriones use the bow; like Pandarus and Paris, on the Trojan side, they"
3967,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"resort to bow or spear, as occasion serves. Odysseus, in _Iliad_, Book"
3968,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"X., is armed with the bow and arrows of Meriones when acting as a spy;"
3969,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"in the _Odyssey_ his skill as an archer is notorious, but he would not"
3970,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"pretend to equal famous bowmen of an older generation, such as Heracles"
3971,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"and Eurytus of OEchalia, whose bow he possessed but did not take to"

3979,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"the Scots in the old wars with England. Dupplin, Falkirk, Halidon Hill"
3980,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,and many another field proved the error.
3981,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,
3982,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,There was much need in Homeric warfare for protection against heavy
3983,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"showers of arrows. Mr. Monro is hardly correct when he says that, in"
3984,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"Homer, ""we do not hear of _BODIES_ of archers, of arrows darkening the"
3985,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"air, as in descriptions of oriental warfare."" [Footnote: _Ibid._,"
3986,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"vol. ii. 305.] These precise phrases are not used by Homer; but,"
3987,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"nevertheless, arrows are flying thick in his battle pieces. The effects"
3988,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"are not often noticed, because, in Homer, helmet, shield, corslet,"
3989,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"_zoster_, and greaves, as a rule prevent the shafts from harming"
3990,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"the well-born, well-armed chiefs; the nameless host, however, fall"
3991,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"frequently. When Hector came forward for a parley (_Iliad_, III."
3992,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"79), the Achaens ""kept shooting at him with arrows,"" which he took"
3993,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"unconcernedly. Teucer shoots nine men in _Iliad_, VIII. 297-304. In"
3994,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,XI. _85_ the shafts ([Greek: belea]) showered and the common soldiers
3995,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,fell--[misprint] being arrows as well as thrown spears. [Footnote:
3996,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"_Iliad_, IV. 465; XVI. 668, 678.] Agamemnon and Achilles are as likely,"
3997,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"they say, to be hit by arrow as by spear (XI. 191; XXI. 13). Machaon is"
3998,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"wounded by an arrow. Patroclus meets Eurypylus limping, with an arrow in"
3999,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"his thigh--archer unknown. [Footnote: _Iliad_, XI. 809, 810.] Meriones,"
4000,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"though an Achaean paladin, sends a bronze-headed arrow through the body"
4001,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,of Harpalion (XIII. _650_). The light-armed Locrians are all bowmen and
4002,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"slingers (XIII. 716). Acamas taunts the Argives as ""bowmen"" (XIV."
4003,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"479). ""The war-cry rose on both sides, and the arrows leaped from the"
4004,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"bowstrings"" (XV. 313). Manifestly the arrows are always on the wing,"
4005,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"hence the need for the huge Homeric and Mycenaean shields. Therefore,"
4006,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,as the Achaeans in Homer wore but flimsy corslets (this we are going to
4007,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"prove), the great body-covering shield of the Mycenaean prime did not"
4008,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"go out of vogue in Homer's time, when bronze had superseded stone"
4009,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"arrow-heads, but was strengthened by bronze plating over the leather."
4010,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"In a later age the bow was more and more neglected in Greek warfare, and"
4011,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"consequently large shields went out, after the close of the Mycenaean"
4012,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"age, and round parrying bucklers came into use."

4027,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,The course of evolution seems to be: (1) the Mycenaean prime of much
4028,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"archery, no body armour (?); huge leather ""man-covering"" shields are"
4029,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"used, like those of the Algonquins; (2) the same shields strengthened"
4030,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"with metal, light body armour-thin corslets--and archery is frequent,"
4031,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,but somewhat despised (the Homeric age); (3) the parrying shield of
4032,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,the latest Mycenaean age (infantry with body armour); (4) the Ionian
4033,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"hoplites, with body armour and small circular bucklers."
4034,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,
4035,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"It appears, then, that the monstrous Mycenaean shield is a survival of"
4036,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,an age when bows and arrows played the same great part as they did in
4037,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,the wars of the Algonquins and Iroquois. The celebrated picture of a
4038,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"siege on a silver vase, of which fragments were found in Grave IV.,"
4039,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,shows archers skirmishing; there is an archer in the lion hunt on the
4040,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,dagger blade; thirty-five obsidian arrow-heads were discovered in Grave
4041,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"IV., while ""in the upper strata of Mycenae and in the later tombs the"
4042,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"arrow-head is usually of bronze, though instances of obsidian still"
4043,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"occur."" In 1895 Dr. Tsountas found twenty arrow-heads of bronze, ten in"
4044,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"each bundle, in a Mycenaean chamber tomb. Messrs. Tsountas and Manatt"
4045,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"say, ""In the Acropolis graves at Mycenae... the spear-heads were but"
4046,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"few... arrow-heads, on the contrary, are comparatively abundant."""
4047,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"They infer that ""picked men used shield and spear; the rank and file"
4048,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"doubtless fought simply with bow and sling."" [Footnote: Tsountas and"
4049,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"Manatt, zog. [sic]]. The great Mycenaean shield was obviously evolved"
4050,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,as a defence against arrows and sling-stones flying too freely to be
4051,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,parried with a small buckler. What other purpose could it have served?
4052,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"But other defensive armour was needed, and was evolved, by Homer's men,"
4053,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"as also, we shall see, by the Algonquins and Iroquois. The Algonquins"
4054,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,and Iroquois thus prove that men who thought their huge shields very
4055,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"efficient, yet felt the desirableness of the protection afforded by"
4056,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"corslets, for they wore, in addition to their shields, such corslets as"
4057,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"they were able to manufacture, made of cotton, and corresponding to"
4058,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,the Homeric [Greek: linothoraex]. [Footnote: In the interior of some
4059,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"shields, perhaps of all, were two [Greek: kanones] (VIII 193; XIII."
4060,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,407). These have been understood as meaning a brace through which the
4061,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"left arm went, and another brace which the left hand grasped. Herodotus"
4062,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"says that the Carians first used shield grips, and that previously"
4063,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,shields were suspended by belts from the neck and left shoulder
4064,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"(Herodotus, i. 171). It would be interesting to know how he learned"
4065,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,these facts-perhaps from Homer; but certainly the Homeric shield is
4066,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,often described as suspended by a belt. Mr. Leaf used to explain the
4067,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"[Greek: kanones] (XIII. 407) as ""serving to attach the two ends of the"
4068,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"baldrick to the shield"" (_Hellenic_ Society's _Journal_, iv. 291), as"
4069,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"does Mr. Ridgeway. But now he thinks that they were two pieces of wood,"
4070,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"crossing each other, and making the framework on which the leather of"
4071,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"the shield was stretched. The hero could grasp the cross-bar, at the"
4072,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"centre of gravity, in his left hand, rest the lower rim of the shield on"
4073,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"the ground, and crouch behind it (XI. 593; XIII 157). In neither passage"
4074,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"cited is anything said about resting the lower rim ""on the ground,"""
4075,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,and in the second passage the warrior is actually advancing. In this
4076,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"attitude, however-grounding the lower rim of the great body-covering"
4077,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"shield, and crouching behind it--we see Algonquin warriors of about 1610"
4078,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,in Champlain's drawings of Red Indian warfare.]
4079,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,
4080,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"Mr. Leaf, indeed, when reviewing Reichel, says that ""the use of the"
4081,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,Mycenaean shield is inconsistent with that of the metal breastplate;
4082,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,'the shield' covers the wearer in a way which makes a breastplate an
4083,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"useless encumbrance; or rather, it is ignorance of the breastplate which"
4084,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,alone can explain the use of such frightfully cumbrous gear as the huge
4085,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"shield."" [Footnote: _Classical Review_, ix. p. 55. 1895.]"
4086,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,
4087,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,But the Algonquins and Iroquois wore such breastplates as they could
4088,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"manufacture, though they also used shields of great size, suspended, in"
4089,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"Mycenaean fashion, from the neck and shoulder by a _telamon_ or belt."
4090,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"The knights of the eleventh century A.D., in addition to very large"
4091,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"shields, wore ponderous hauberks or byrnies, as we shall prove"
4092,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,presently. As this combination of great shield with corslet was common
4093,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"and natural, we cannot agree with Mr. Leaf when he says, ""it follows"
4094,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"that the Homeric warriors wore no metal breastplate, and that all"
4095,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,the passages where the [Greek: thoraes] is mentioned are either later
4096,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"interpolations or refer to some other sort of armour,"" which, _ex"
4097,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"hypothesi_, would itself be superfluous, given the body-covering shield."
4098,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,
4099,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,Shields never make corslets superfluous when men can manufacture
4100,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,corslets.
4101,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,
4102,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"The facts speak for themselves: the largest shields are not exclusive,"
4103,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"so to speak, of corslets; the Homeric warriors used both, just as did"
4104,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,Red Indians and the mediaeval chivalry of Europe. The use of the aspis
4105,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"in Homer, therefore, throws no suspicion on the concomitant use of the"
4106,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"corslet. The really surprising fact would be if late poets, who knew"
4107,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"only small round bucklers, never introduced them into the poems, but"
4108,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"always spoke of enormous shields, while they at the same time did"
4109,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"introduce corslets, unknown to the early poems which they continued."
4110,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,Clearly Reichel's theory is ill inspired and inconsistent. This becomes
4111,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,plain as soon as we trace the evolution of shields and corslets in
4112,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,ages when the bow played a great part in war. The Homeric bronze-plated
4113,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,shield and bronze corslet are defences of a given moment in military
4114,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,evolution; they are improvements on the large leather shield of
4115,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"Mycenaean art, but, as the arrows still fly in clouds, the time for the"
4116,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,small parrying buckler has not yet come.
4117,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,
4118,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"By the age of the Dipylon vases with human figures, the shield had been"
4119,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,developed into forms unknown to Homer. In Fig. 3 (p. 131) we see one
4120,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"warrior with a fantastic shield, slim at the waist, with horns, as"
4121,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"it were, above and below; the greater part of the shield is expended"
4122,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"uselessly, covering nothing in particular. In form this targe seems to"
4123,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,be a burlesque parody of the figure of a Mycenaean shield. The next
4124,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,"man has a short oblong shield, rather broad for its length--perhaps a"
4125,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,reduction of the Mycenaean door-shaped shield. The third warrior has a
4126,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,round buckler. All these shields are manifestly post-Homeric; the first
4127,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,type is the most common in the Dipylon art; the third survived in the
4128,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,eighth-century buckler.

4146,THE BREASTPLATE,"Schuchardt, _Schliemann's_ Excavations, pp. 254-257, fig. 256.]"
4147,THE BREASTPLATE,These decorative corslets of gold were probably funereal symbols of
4148,THE BREASTPLATE,"practicable breastplates of bronze, but no such pieces of armour are"
4149,THE BREASTPLATE,"worn by the fighting-men on the gems and other works of art of Mycenae,"
4150,THE BREASTPLATE,and none are found in Mycenaean graves. But does this prove anything?
4151,THE BREASTPLATE,"Leg-guards, broad metal bands clasping the leg below the knee, are found"
4152,THE BREASTPLATE,"in the Mycenaean shaft graves, but are never represented in Mycenaean"
4153,THE BREASTPLATE,"art. [Footnote: Leaf, _Iliad_, vol. i. p. 575.] Meanwhile, bronze"
4154,THE BREASTPLATE,"corslets are very frequently mentioned in the ""rarely alluded to,"" says"
4155,THE BREASTPLATE,"Mr. Leaf, [Footnote: _Iliad_, vol. i. p. 576.] but this must be a"
4156,THE BREASTPLATE,slip of the pen. Connected with the breastplate or _thorex_ ([Greek:
4157,THE BREASTPLATE,"thoraex]) is the verb [Greek: thoraesso, thoraessethai], which means ""to"
4158,THE BREASTPLATE,"arm,"" or ""equip"" in general."
4159,THE BREASTPLATE,
4160,THE BREASTPLATE,The Achaeans are constantly styled in the _ILIAD_ and in the _ODYSSEY_
4161,THE BREASTPLATE,"""_chalkochitones_,"" ""with bronze chitons."" epics have therefore boldly"
4162,THE BREASTPLATE,"argued that by ""bronze chitons"" the poet pleasantly alludes to shields."
4163,THE BREASTPLATE,But as the Mycenaeans seem scarcely to have worn any _CHITONS_ in
4164,THE BREASTPLATE,"battle, as far as we are aware from their art, and are not known to have"
4165,THE BREASTPLATE,"had any bronze shields, the argument evaporates, as Mr. Ridgeway has"
4166,THE BREASTPLATE,"pointed out. Nothing can be less like a _chiton_ or smock, loose or"
4167,THE BREASTPLATE,"tight, than either the double-bellied huge shield, the tower-shaped"
4168,THE BREASTPLATE,"cylindrical shield, or the flat, doorlike shield, covering body and legs"
4169,THE BREASTPLATE,"in Mycenaean art. ""The bronze _chiton_,"" says Helbig, ""is only a poetic"
4170,THE BREASTPLATE,"phrase for the corslet."""
4171,THE BREASTPLATE,
4172,THE BREASTPLATE,"Reichel and Mr. Leaf, however, think that ""bronze chitoned"" is probably"
4173,THE BREASTPLATE,"""a picturesque expression... and refers to the bronze-covered shield."""
4174,THE BREASTPLATE,"[Footnote: Leaf, _Iliad_, i. 578.] The breastplate covered the upper"
4175,THE BREASTPLATE,"part of the _chiton_, and so might be called a ""bronze _chiton_,"" above"
4176,THE BREASTPLATE,"all, if it had been evolved, as corselets usually have been, out of"
4177,THE BREASTPLATE,"a real _chiton_, interwoven with small plates or rings of bronze. The"
4178,THE BREASTPLATE,process of evolution might be from a padded linen _chiton_ ([Greek:
4179,THE BREASTPLATE,"linothooraes]) worn by Teucer, and on the Trojan side by Amphius (as"
4180,THE BREASTPLATE,"by nervous Protestants during Oates's ""Popish Plot""), to a leathern"
4181,THE BREASTPLATE,"_chiton_, strengthened by rings, or studs, or scales of bronze, and"
4182,THE BREASTPLATE,"thence to plates. [Footnote: Ridgeway, _Early Age of Greece_, vol. i."
4183,THE BREASTPLATE,"pp. 309, 310.] Here, in this armoured _chiton_, would be an object that"
4184,THE BREASTPLATE,"a poet might readily call ""a _chiton_ of bronze."" But that, if he lived"
4185,THE BREASTPLATE,"in the Mycenaean age, when, so far as art shows, _CHITONS_ were not worn"
4186,THE BREASTPLATE,"at all, or very little, and scarcely ever in battle, and when we know"
4187,THE BREASTPLATE,"nothing of bronze-plating on shields, the poet should constantly call a"
4188,THE BREASTPLATE,"monstrous double-bellied leather shield, or any other Mycemean type of"
4189,THE BREASTPLATE,"shield, ""a _bronze chiton_,"" seems almost unthinkable. ""A leather cloak"""
4190,THE BREASTPLATE,"would be a better term for such shields, if cloaks were in fashion."
4191,THE BREASTPLATE,
4192,THE BREASTPLATE,"According to Mr. Myres (1899) the ""stock line"" in the _Iliad_, about"
4193,THE BREASTPLATE,"piercing a [Greek: poludaidalos thoraex] or corslet, was inserted ""to"
4194,THE BREASTPLATE,"satisfy the practical criticisms of a corslet-wearing age,"" the age of"
4195,THE BREASTPLATE,"the later poets, the Age of Iron. But why did not such practical critics"
4196,THE BREASTPLATE,"object to the constant presence in the poems of bronze weapons, in their"
4197,THE BREASTPLATE,"age out of date, if they objected to the absence from the poems of the"
4198,THE BREASTPLATE,corslets with which they were familiar? Mr. Myres supposes that the line
4199,THE BREASTPLATE,"about the [Greek: poludaidalos] corslet was already old, but had merely"
4200,THE BREASTPLATE,"meant ""many-glittering body clothing""--garments set with the golden"
4201,THE BREASTPLATE,"discs and other ornaments found in Mycemean graves. The bronze corslet,"
4202,THE BREASTPLATE,"he says, would not be ""many glittering,"" but would reflect ""a single"
4203,THE BREASTPLATE,"star of light."" [Footnote: _Journal of Hellenic Studies._ 1899] Now,"
4204,THE BREASTPLATE,"first, even if the star were a single star, it would be as ""many"
4205,THE BREASTPLATE,"glittering"" when the warrior was in rapid and changeful motion as the"
4206,THE BREASTPLATE,"star that danced when Beatrix was born. Secondly, if the contemporary"
4207,THE BREASTPLATE,"corslets of the Iron Age were NOT ""many glittering,"" practical"
4208,THE BREASTPLATE,"corslet-wearing critics would ask the poet, ""why do you call corslets"
4209,THE BREASTPLATE,"'many glittering'?"" Thirdly, [Greek: poludaidalos] may surely be"
4210,THE BREASTPLATE,"translated ""a thing of much art,"" and Greek corslets were incised with"
4211,THE BREASTPLATE,"ornamental designs. Thus Messrs. Hogarth and Bosanquet report ""a very"
4212,THE BREASTPLATE,"remarkable 'Mycemean' bronze breastplate"" from Crete, which ""shows four"
4213,THE BREASTPLATE,"female draped figures, the two central ones holding a wreath over a"
4214,THE BREASTPLATE,"bird, below which is a sacred tree. The two outer figures are apparently"
4215,THE BREASTPLATE,"dancing. It is probably a ritual scene, and may help to elucidate the"
4216,THE BREASTPLATE,"nature of early AEgean cults."" [Footnote: _Journal of Hellenic Studies,"
4217,THE BREASTPLATE,"vol. xx_. p. 322. 1899.] Here, [Greek: poludaidalos]--if that word means"
4218,THE BREASTPLATE,"""artistically wrought."" Helbig thinks the Epics silent about the gold"
4219,THE BREASTPLATE,"spangles on dresses. [Footnote: Helbig, p. 71.]"
4220,THE BREASTPLATE,
4221,THE BREASTPLATE,Mr. Myres applauds Reichel's theory that [blank space] first meant
4222,THE BREASTPLATE,"a man's chest. If _thorex_ means a man's breast, then _THOREX_ in a"
4223,THE BREASTPLATE,"secondary sense, one thinks, would mean ""breastplate,"" as waist of a"
4224,THE BREASTPLATE,"woman means, first, her waist; next, her blouse (American). But Mr."
4225,THE BREASTPLATE,Myres and Reichel say that the secondary sense of _THOREX_ is not
4226,THE BREASTPLATE,"breastplate but ""body clothing,"" as if a man were all breast, or wore"
4227,THE BREASTPLATE,"only a breast covering, whereas Mycenaean art shows men wearing nothing"
4228,THE BREASTPLATE,"on their breasts, merely drawers or loin-cloths, which could not be"
4229,THE BREASTPLATE,"called _THOREX_, as they cover the antipodes of the breast."
4230,THE BREASTPLATE,
4231,THE BREASTPLATE,"The verb [Greek: thoraesestai], the theory runs on, merely meant ""to"
4232,THE BREASTPLATE,"put on body clothing,"" which Mycenaeans in works of art, if correctly"
4233,THE BREASTPLATE,"represented, do not usually put on; they fought naked or in bathing"
4234,THE BREASTPLATE,"drawers. Surely we might as well argue that a ""waistcoat"" might come"
4235,THE BREASTPLATE,"to mean ""body clothing in general,"" as that a word for the male breast"
4236,THE BREASTPLATE,"became, first, a synonym for the covering of the male buttocks and for"
4237,THE BREASTPLATE,"apparel in general, and, next, for a bronze breastplate. These arguments"
4238,THE BREASTPLATE,"appear rather unconvincing, [Footnote: _Journal of Hellenic Studies_,"
4239,THE BREASTPLATE,"vol. xx. pp. 149, 150.] nor does Mycenaean art instruct us that men went"
4240,THE BREASTPLATE,into battle dressed in body clothing which was thickly set with many
4241,THE BREASTPLATE,"glittering gold ornaments, and was called ""a many-glittering _thorex_."""
4242,THE BREASTPLATE,
4243,THE BREASTPLATE,"Further, if we follow Reichel and Mr. Leaf, the Mycenaeans wore"
4244,THE BREASTPLATE,_chitons_ and called them _chitons_. They also used bronze-plated
4245,THE BREASTPLATE,"shields, though of this we have no evidence. Taking the bronze-plated"
4246,THE BREASTPLATE,"(?) shield to stand poetically for the _chiton_, the poet spoke of ""_the"
4247,THE BREASTPLATE,"bronze-chitoned Achaeans_"" But, if we follow Mr. Myres, the Mycenaeans"
4248,THE BREASTPLATE,"also applied the word _thorex_ to body clothing at large, in place of"
4249,THE BREASTPLATE,"the word _chiton_; and when a warrior was transfixed by a spear, they"
4250,THE BREASTPLATE,"said that his ""many-glittering, gold-studded _thorex_,"" that is, his"
4251,THE BREASTPLATE,"body clothing in general, was pierced. It does seem simpler to hold"
4252,THE BREASTPLATE,"that _chiton_ meant _chiton_; that _thorex_ meant, first, ""breast,"" then"
4253,THE BREASTPLATE,"""breastplate,"" whether of linen, or plaited leather, or bronze, and"
4254,THE BREASTPLATE,that to pierce a man through his [Greek: poludaidalos thoraex] meant to
4255,THE BREASTPLATE,pierce him through his handsome corslet. No mortal ever dreamt that this
4256,THE BREASTPLATE,was so till Reichel tried to make out that the original poet describes
4257,THE BREASTPLATE,"no armour except the large Mycenaean shield and the _mitrê_, and that"
4258,THE BREASTPLATE,all corslets in the poems were of much later introduction. Possibly they
4259,THE BREASTPLATE,"were, but they had plenty of time wherein to be evolved long before the"
4260,THE BREASTPLATE,"eighth century, Reichel's date for corslets."
4261,THE BREASTPLATE,
4262,THE BREASTPLATE,"The argument is that a man with a large shield needs no body armour, or"
4263,THE BREASTPLATE,uses the shield because he has no body armour.
4264,THE BREASTPLATE,
4265,THE BREASTPLATE,"But the possession and use of a large shield did not in the Middle Ages,"
4266,THE BREASTPLATE,"or among the Iroquois and Algonquins, make men dispense with corslets,"
4267,THE BREASTPLATE,"even when the shield was worn, as in Homer, slung round the neck by a"
4268,THE BREASTPLATE,"_telamon_ (_guige_ in Old French), belt, or baldric."
4269,THE BREASTPLATE,
4270,THE BREASTPLATE,We turn to a French _Chanson de Geste--La Chancun de Willem_--of the
4271,THE BREASTPLATE,"twelfth century A.D., to judge by the handwriting. One of the heroes,"
4272,THE BREASTPLATE,"Girard, having failed to rescue Vivien in battle, throws down his"
4273,THE BREASTPLATE,"weapons and armour, blaming each piece for having failed him. Down"
4274,THE BREASTPLATE,"goes the heavy lance; down goes the ponderous shield, suspended by a"
4275,THE BREASTPLATE,"_telamon: ""Ohitarge grant cume peises al col_!"" down goes the plated"
4276,THE BREASTPLATE,"byrnie, ""_Ohi grant broine cum me vas apesant_"" [Footnote: _La Chancun"
4277,THE BREASTPLATE,"de Willame_, lines 716-726.]"
4278,THE BREASTPLATE,
4279,THE BREASTPLATE,The mediaeval warrior has a heavy byrnie as well as a great shield
4280,THE BREASTPLATE,suspended from his neck. It will be remarked also that the Algonquins
4281,THE BREASTPLATE,"and Iroquois of the beginning of the seventeenth century, as described"
4282,THE BREASTPLATE,"by Champlain, give us the whole line of Mycenaean evolution of armour up"
4283,THE BREASTPLATE,"to a certain point. Not only had they arrow-proof, body-covering shields"
4284,THE BREASTPLATE,"of buffalo hide, but, when Champlain used his arquebus against the"
4285,THE BREASTPLATE,"Iroquois in battle, ""they were struck amazed that two of their number"
4286,THE BREASTPLATE,"should have been killed so promptly, seeing that they wore a sort of"
4287,THE BREASTPLATE,"armour, woven of cotton thread, and carried arrow-proof shields."""
4288,THE BREASTPLATE,"We have already alluded to this passage, but must add that Parkman,"
4289,THE BREASTPLATE,describing from French archives a battle of Illinois against Iroquois
4290,THE BREASTPLATE,"in 1680, speaks of ""corslets of tough twigs interwoven with cordage."""
4291,THE BREASTPLATE,"[Footnote: _Discovery of the Great IV_, [misprint] 1869.] Golden, in his"
4292,THE BREASTPLATE,"_Five Nations_, writes of the Red Indians as wearing ""a kind of cuirass"
4293,THE BREASTPLATE,"made of pieces of wood joined together."" [Footnote: Dix, _Champlion_"
4294,THE BREASTPLATE,[misprint]]
4295,THE BREASTPLATE,
4296,THE BREASTPLATE,To the kindness of Mr. Hill Tout I also owe a description of the armour
4297,THE BREASTPLATE,"of the Indian tribes of north-west America, from a work of his own."
4298,THE BREASTPLATE,"He says: ""For protective purposes in warfare they employed shields"
4299,THE BREASTPLATE,and coat-armour. The shields varied in form and material from tribe to
4300,THE BREASTPLATE,"tribe. Among the Interior Salish they were commonly made of wood, which"
4301,THE BREASTPLATE,was afterwards covered with hide. Sometimes they consisted of several
4302,THE BREASTPLATE,thicknesses of hide only. The hides most commonly used were those of the
4303,THE BREASTPLATE,"elk, buffalo, or bear. After the advent of the Hudson's Bay Co. some of"
4304,THE BREASTPLATE,the Indians used to beat out the large copper kettles they obtained from
4305,THE BREASTPLATE,the traders and make polished circular shields of these. In some centres
4306,THE BREASTPLATE,"long rectangular shields, made from a single or double hide, were"
4307,THE BREASTPLATE,employed. These were often from 4 to 5 feet in length and from 3 to
4308,THE BREASTPLATE,4 feet in width--large enough to cover the whole body. Among the
4309,THE BREASTPLATE,Déné tribes (Sikanis) the shield was generally made of closely-woven
4310,THE BREASTPLATE,"wicker-work, and was of an ovaloid form (exact size not given)."
4311,THE BREASTPLATE,
4312,THE BREASTPLATE,"""The coat armour was _everywhere used_, and varied in form and style in"
4313,THE BREASTPLATE,almost every centre. There were two ways in which this was most commonly
4314,THE BREASTPLATE,"made. One of these was the slatted cuirass or corslet, which was formed"
4315,THE BREASTPLATE,of a series of narrow slats of wood set side by side vertically and
4316,THE BREASTPLATE,fastened in place by interfacings of raw hide. It went all round the
4317,THE BREASTPLATE,"body, being hung from the shoulders with straps. The other was a kind"
4318,THE BREASTPLATE,"of shirt of double or treble elk hide, fastened at the side with thongs."
4319,THE BREASTPLATE,"Another kind of armour, less common than that just described, was the"
4320,THE BREASTPLATE,"long elk-hide tunic, which reached to and even _below the knees and was"
4321,THE BREASTPLATE,"sleeved to the elbow.""_"
4322,THE BREASTPLATE,
4323,THE BREASTPLATE,"Mr. Hill Tout's minute description, with the other facts cited, leaves"
4324,THE BREASTPLATE,"no doubt that even in an early stage, as in later stages of culture, the"
4325,THE BREASTPLATE,use of the great shield does not exclude the use of such body armour
4326,THE BREASTPLATE,as the means of the warriors enable them to construct. To take another
4327,THE BREASTPLATE,"instance, Pausanias describes the corslets of the neolithic Sarmatae,"
4328,THE BREASTPLATE,which he saw dedicated in the temple of Asclepius at Athens. Corslets
4329,THE BREASTPLATE,"these bowmen and users of the lasso possessed, though they did not use"
4330,THE BREASTPLATE,"the metals. They fashioned very elegant corslets out of horses' hoofs,"
4331,THE BREASTPLATE,"cutting them into scales like those of a pine cone, and sewing them on"
4332,THE BREASTPLATE,"to cloth. [Footnote: Pausanias, i. 211. [misprint] 6.]"
4333,THE BREASTPLATE,
4334,THE BREASTPLATE,"Certain small, thin, perforated discs of stone found in Scotland have"
4335,THE BREASTPLATE,been ingeniously explained as plates to be strung together on a garment
4336,THE BREASTPLATE,"of cloth, a neolithic _chiton_. However this may be, since Iroquois and"
4337,THE BREASTPLATE,"Algonquins and Déné had some sort of woven, or plaited, or wooden, or"
4338,THE BREASTPLATE,"buff corslet, in addition to their great shields, we may suppose that"
4339,THE BREASTPLATE,the Achaeans would not be less inventive. They would pass from the
4340,THE BREASTPLATE,[Greek: linothoraex] (answering to the cotton corslet of the Iroquois)
4341,THE BREASTPLATE,"to a sort of jack or _jaseran_ with rings, scales, or plates, and thence"
4342,THE BREASTPLATE,"to bronze-plate corslets, represented only by the golden breastplates of"
4343,THE BREASTPLATE,"the Mycenaean grave. Even if the Mycenaeans did not evolve the corslet,"
4344,THE BREASTPLATE,"there is no reason why, in the Homeric times, it should not have been"
4345,THE BREASTPLATE,evolved.
4346,THE BREASTPLATE,
4347,THE BREASTPLATE,"For linen corslets, such as Homer mentions, in actual use and"
4348,THE BREASTPLATE,represented in works of art we consult Mr. Leaf on _The Armour_
4349,THE BREASTPLATE,"of _Homeric_ Heroes.' He finds Memnon in a white corslet, on a"
4350,THE BREASTPLATE,black-figured vase in the British Museum. There is another white
4351,THE BREASTPLATE,"corsleted [Footnote: _Journal_ of _Hellenic_ Studies, vol. iv. pp."
4352,THE BREASTPLATE,"82, 83, 85.] Memnon figured in the _Vases Peints_ of the Duc de Luynes"
4353,THE BREASTPLATE,"(plate xii.). Mr. Leaf suggests that the white colour represents ""a"
4354,THE BREASTPLATE,"corslet not of metal but of linen,"" and cites _Iliad_, II. 529, 5"
4355,THE BREASTPLATE,"30. ""Xenophon mentions linen corslets as being worn by the Chalybes"""
4356,THE BREASTPLATE,"(_Anabasis_, iv. 15). Two linen corslets, sent from Egypt to Sparta by"
4357,THE BREASTPLATE,"King Amasis, are recorded by Herodotus (ii. 182; iii. 47). The corslets"
4358,THE BREASTPLATE,"were of linen, embroidered in cotton and gold. Such a piece of armour"
4359,THE BREASTPLATE,or attire might easily develop into the [Greek: streptos chitoon] of
4360,THE BREASTPLATE,"_Iliad_, V. 113, in which Aristarchus appears to have recognised chain"
4361,THE BREASTPLATE,or scale armour; but we find no such object represented in Mycenaean
4362,THE BREASTPLATE,"art, which, of course, does not depict Homeric armour or costume, and"
4363,THE BREASTPLATE,it seems probable that the bronze corslets mentioned by Homer were plate
4364,THE BREASTPLATE,armour. The linen corslet lasted into the early sixth century B.C. In
4365,THE BREASTPLATE,"the poem called _Stasiotica_, Alcaeus (_No_. 5) speaks of his helmets,"
4366,THE BREASTPLATE,bronze greaves and corslets of linen ([Choorakes te neoi linoo]) as a
4367,THE BREASTPLATE,defence against arrows.
4368,THE BREASTPLATE,
4369,THE BREASTPLATE,"Meanwhile a ""bronze _chiton_"" or corslet would turn spent arrows and"
4370,THE BREASTPLATE,"spent spears, and be very useful to a warrior whose shield left him"
4371,THE BREASTPLATE,"exposed to shafts shot or spears thrown from a distance. Again, such"
4372,THE BREASTPLATE,a bronze _chiton_ might stop a spear of which the impetus was spent in
4373,THE BREASTPLATE,"penetrating the shield. But Homeric corslets did not, as a rule, avail"
4374,THE BREASTPLATE,"to keep out a spear driven by the hand at close quarters, or powerfully"
4375,THE BREASTPLATE,thrown from a short distance. Even the later Greek corslets do not look
4376,THE BREASTPLATE,as if they could resist a heavy spear wielded by a strong hand.
4377,THE BREASTPLATE,
4378,THE BREASTPLATE,I proceed to show that the Homeric corslet did not avail against a
4379,THE BREASTPLATE,"spear at close quarters, but could turn an arrow point (once), and could"
4380,THE BREASTPLATE,"sometimes turn a spear which had perforated a shield. So far, and not"
4381,THE BREASTPLATE,"further, the Homeric corslet was serviceable. But if a warrior's breast"
4382,THE BREASTPLATE,"or back was not covered by the shield, and received a thrust at close"
4383,THE BREASTPLATE,"quarters, the corslet was pierced more easily than the pad of paper"
4384,THE BREASTPLATE,which was said to have been used as secret armour in a duel by the
4385,THE BREASTPLATE,Master of Sinclair (1708). [Footnote: _Proceedings in Court Marshal held
4386,THE BREASTPLATE,"upon John, Master of Sinclair_. Sir Walter Scott. Roxburghe Club."
4387,THE BREASTPLATE,"(Date of event, 1708.)] It is desirable to prove this feebleness of the"
4388,THE BREASTPLATE,"corslet, because the poet often says that a man was smitten with"
4389,THE BREASTPLATE,"the spear in breast or back when unprotected by the shield, without"
4390,THE BREASTPLATE,"mentioning the corslet, whence it is argued by the critics that corslets"
4391,THE BREASTPLATE,"were not worn when the original lays were fashioned, and that they have"
4392,THE BREASTPLATE,"only been sporadically introduced, in an after age when the corslet was"
4393,THE BREASTPLATE,"universal, by ""modernising"" later rhapsodists aiming at the up-to-date."
4394,THE BREASTPLATE,
4395,THE BREASTPLATE,"A weak point is the argument that Homer says back or breast was pierced,"
4396,THE BREASTPLATE,"without mentioning the corslet, whence it follows that he knew no"
4397,THE BREASTPLATE,"corslets. Quintus Smyrnaeus does the same thing. Of course, Quintus"
4398,THE BREASTPLATE,"knew all about corslets, yet (Book I. 248, 256, 257) he makes his heroes"
4399,THE BREASTPLATE,drive spear or sword through breast or belly without mentioning the
4400,THE BREASTPLATE,"resistance of the corslet, even when (I. 144, 594) he has assured"
4401,THE BREASTPLATE,us that the victim was wearing a corslet. These facts are not due
4402,THE BREASTPLATE,to inconsistent interpolation of corslets into the work of this
4403,THE BREASTPLATE,post-Christian poet Quintus. [Footnote: I find a similar omission in the
4404,THE BREASTPLATE,_Chanson de Roland_.]
4405,THE BREASTPLATE,
4406,THE BREASTPLATE,"Corslets, in Homer, are flimsy; that of Lycaon, worn by Paris, is"
4407,THE BREASTPLATE,"pierced by a spear which has also perforated his shield, though the"
4408,THE BREASTPLATE,"spear came only from the weak hand of Menelaus (_Iliad_, III. 357, 358)."
4409,THE BREASTPLATE,The arrow of Pandarus whistles through the corslet of Menelaus (IV.
4410,THE BREASTPLATE,136). The same archer pierces with an arrow the corslet of Diomede (V.
4411,THE BREASTPLATE,"99, 100). The corslet of Diomede, however, avails to stop a spear which"
4412,THE BREASTPLATE,has traversed his shield (V. 281). The spear of Idomeneus pierces
4413,THE BREASTPLATE,"the corslet of Othryoneus, and the spear of Antilochus perforates the"
4414,THE BREASTPLATE,"corslet of a charioteer (XIII. 371, 397). A few lines later Diomede's"
4415,THE BREASTPLATE,"spear reaches the midriff of Hypsenor. No corslet is here mentioned, but"
4416,THE BREASTPLATE,"neither is the shield mentioned (this constantly occurs), and we cannot"
4417,THE BREASTPLATE,"argue that Hypsenor wore no corslet, unless we are also to contend that"
4418,THE BREASTPLATE,"he wore no shield, or a small shield. Idomeneus drives his spear through"
4419,THE BREASTPLATE,"the ""_bronze chiton_"" of Alcathöus (XIII. 439, 440). Mr. Leaf reckons"
4420,THE BREASTPLATE,"these lines ""probably an interpolation to turn the linen _chiton_, the"
4421,THE BREASTPLATE,"rending of which is the sign of triumph, into a bronze corslet."" But we"
4422,THE BREASTPLATE,"ask why, if an editor or rhapsodist went through the _Iliad_ introducing"
4423,THE BREASTPLATE,"corslets, he so often left them out, where the critics detect their"
4424,THE BREASTPLATE,absence because they are not mentioned?
4425,THE BREASTPLATE,
4426,THE BREASTPLATE,The spear of Idomeneus pierces another feeble corslet over the victim's
4427,THE BREASTPLATE,belly (XIII. 506-508). It is quite a surprise when a corslet does for
4428,THE BREASTPLATE,once avail to turn an arrow (XIII. 586-587). But Aias drives his spear
4429,THE BREASTPLATE,"through the corslet of Phorcys, into his belly (XVII 311-312). Thus the"
4430,THE BREASTPLATE,"corslet scarcely ever, by itself, protects a hero; it never protects"
4431,THE BREASTPLATE,him against an unspent spear; even when his shield stands between his
4432,THE BREASTPLATE,corslet and the spear both are sometimes perforated. Yet occasionally
4433,THE BREASTPLATE,the corslet saves a man when the spear has gone through the shield. The
4434,THE BREASTPLATE,"poet, therefore, sometimes gives us a man pierced in a part which the"
4435,THE BREASTPLATE,"corslet covers, without mentioning the flimsy article that could not"
4436,THE BREASTPLATE,keep out a spear.
4437,THE BREASTPLATE,
4438,THE BREASTPLATE,"Reichel himself came to see, before his regretted death, that he could"
4439,THE BREASTPLATE,"not explain away the _thorex_ or corslet, on his original lines, as a"
4440,THE BREASTPLATE,"mere general name for ""a piece of armour""; and he inclined to think that"
4441,THE BREASTPLATE,"jacks, with metal plates sewn on, did exist before the Ionian corslet."
4442,THE BREASTPLATE,"[Footnote: _Homerische Waffen_, pp. 93-94. 1901.] The gold breastplates"
4443,THE BREASTPLATE,of the Mycenaean graves pointed in this direction. But his general
4444,THE BREASTPLATE,argument is that corslets were interpolated into the old lays by poets
4445,THE BREASTPLATE,of a corslet-wearing age; and Mr. Leaf holds that corslets may have
4446,THE BREASTPLATE,"filtered in, ""during the course of successive modernisation, such as the"
4447,THE BREASTPLATE,"oldest parts of the _Iliad_ seem in many cases to have passed through,"""
4448,THE BREASTPLATE,"[Footnote: Leaf, Iliad, i. p. 578.] though the new poets were, for all"
4449,THE BREASTPLATE,"that, ""conservatively tenacious of the old material."" We have already"
4450,THE BREASTPLATE,pointed out the difficulty.
4451,THE BREASTPLATE,
4452,THE BREASTPLATE,The poets who did not introduce the new small bucklers with which they
4453,THE BREASTPLATE,"were familiar, did stuff the _Iliad_ full of corslets unknown, by"
4454,THE BREASTPLATE,"the theory, to the original poet, but familiar to rhapsodists living"
4455,THE BREASTPLATE,"centuries later. Why, if they were bent on modernising, did they not"
4456,THE BREASTPLATE,"modernise the shields? and how, if they modernised unconsciously, as all"
4457,THE BREASTPLATE,"uncritical poets do, did the shield fail to be unconsciously ""brought up"
4458,THE BREASTPLATE,"to date""? It seems probable that Homer lived at a period when both huge"
4459,THE BREASTPLATE,shield and rather feeble corslet were in vogue.
4460,THE BREASTPLATE,
4461,THE BREASTPLATE,"We shall now examine some of the passages in which Mr. Leaf, mainly"
4462,THE BREASTPLATE,"following Reichel, raises difficulties about corslets. We do not know"
4463,THE BREASTPLATE,"their mechanism; they were composed of [Greek: guala], presumed to be a"
4464,THE BREASTPLATE,"backplate and a breastplate. The word _gualon_ appears to mean a hollow,"
4465,THE BREASTPLATE,"or the converse, something convex. We cannot understand the mechanism"
4466,THE BREASTPLATE,"(see a young man putting on a corslet, on an amphora by Euthymides."
4467,THE BREASTPLATE,"Walter, vol. ii. p. 176); but, if late poets, familiar with such"
4468,THE BREASTPLATE,"corslets, did not understand how they worked, they were very dull men."
4469,THE BREASTPLATE,"When their descriptions puzzle us, that is more probably because we are"
4470,THE BREASTPLATE,not at the point of view than because poets interpolated mentions of
4471,THE BREASTPLATE,"pieces of armour which they did not understand, and therefore cannot"
4472,THE BREASTPLATE,"have been familiar with, and, in that case, would not introduce."
4473,THE BREASTPLATE,
4474,THE BREASTPLATE,Mr. Leaf starts with a passage in the _Iliad_ (III. 357-360)--it recurs
4475,THE BREASTPLATE,"in another case: ""Through the bright shield went the ponderous"
4476,THE BREASTPLATE,"spear, and through the inwrought"" (very artfully wrought), [Greek:"
4477,THE BREASTPLATE,"poludaidalou] ""breastplate it pressed on, and straight beside his flank"
4478,THE BREASTPLATE,"it rent the tunic, but he swerved and escaped black death."" Mr."
4479,THE BREASTPLATE,"Leaf says, ""It is obvious that, after a spear has passed through a"
4480,THE BREASTPLATE,"breastplate, there is no longer any possibility for the wearer to bend"
4481,THE BREASTPLATE,"aside and so to avoid the point...."" But I suppose that the wearer, by a"
4482,THE BREASTPLATE,"motion very natural, doubled up sideways, so to speak, and so the spear"
4483,THE BREASTPLATE,merely grazed his flesh. That is what I suppose the poet to intend.
4484,THE BREASTPLATE,"The more he knew of corslets, the less would he mention an impossible"
4485,THE BREASTPLATE,circumstance in connection with a corslet.
4486,THE BREASTPLATE,
4487,THE BREASTPLATE,"Again, in many cases the late poets, by the theory--though it is they"
4488,THE BREASTPLATE,"who bring the corslets in--leave the corslets out! A man without shield,"
4489,THE BREASTPLATE,"helmet, and spear calls himself ""naked."" Why did not these late poets,"
4490,THE BREASTPLATE,"it is asked, make him take off his corslet, if he had one, as well as"
4491,THE BREASTPLATE,"his shield? The case occurs in XXII. 111-113,124-125. Hector thinks of"
4492,THE BREASTPLATE,"laying aside helmet, spear, and shield, and of parleying with Achilles."
4493,THE BREASTPLATE,"""But then he will slay me naked,"" that is, unarmed. ""He still had his"
4494,THE BREASTPLATE,"corslet,"" the critics say, ""so how could he be naked? or, if he had"
4495,THE BREASTPLATE,"no corslet, this is a passage uncontaminated by the late poets of the"
4496,THE BREASTPLATE,"corslet age."" Now certainly Hector _was_ wearing a corslet, which he"
4497,THE BREASTPLATE,"had taken from Patroclus: that is the essence of the story. He would,"
4498,THE BREASTPLATE,"however, be ""naked"" or unprotected if he laid aside helmet, spear, and"
4499,THE BREASTPLATE,"shield, because Achilles could hit him in the head or neck (as he did),"
4500,THE BREASTPLATE,"or lightly drive the spear through the corslet, which, we have proved,"
4501,THE BREASTPLATE,"was no sound defence against a spear at close quarters, though useful"
4502,THE BREASTPLATE,"against chance arrows, and occasionally against spears spent by"
4503,THE BREASTPLATE,traversing the shield.
4504,THE BREASTPLATE,
4505,THE BREASTPLATE,"We next learn that no corslet occurs in the _Odyssey_, or in _Iliad_,"
4506,THE BREASTPLATE,"Book X., called ""very late"": Mr. Leaf suggests that it is of the seventh"
4507,THE BREASTPLATE,"century B.C. But if the Odyssey and Iliad, Book X., are really very"
4508,THE BREASTPLATE,"late, their authors and interpolators were perfectly familiar"
4509,THE BREASTPLATE,"with Ionian corslets. Why did they leave corslets out, while their"
4510,THE BREASTPLATE,predecessors and contemporaries were introducing them all up and down
4511,THE BREASTPLATE,"the _Iliad_? In fact, in Book X, no prince is regularly equipped; they"
4512,THE BREASTPLATE,"have been called up to deliberate in the dead of night, and when two go"
4513,THE BREASTPLATE,as spies they wear casual borrowed gear. It is more important that no
4514,THE BREASTPLATE,corslet is mentioned in Nestor's arms in his tent. But are we to explain
4515,THE BREASTPLATE,"this, and the absence of mention of corslets in the Odyssey (where there"
4516,THE BREASTPLATE,"is little about regular fighting), on the ground that the author of"
4517,THE BREASTPLATE,"_Iliad_, Book X., and all the many authors and editors of the"
4518,THE BREASTPLATE,"_Odyssey_ happened to be profound archaeologists, and, unlike their"
4519,THE BREASTPLATE,"contemporaries, the later poets and interpolators of the _Iliad_, had"
4520,THE BREASTPLATE,formed the theory that corslets were not known at the time of the siege
4521,THE BREASTPLATE,of Troy and therefore must not be mentioned? This is quite incredible.
4522,THE BREASTPLATE,No hypothesis can be more improbable. We cannot imagine late Ionian
4523,THE BREASTPLATE,"rhapsodists listening to the _Iliad_, and saying, ""These poets of the"
4524,THE BREASTPLATE,"_Iliad_ are all wrong: at the date of the Mycenaean prime, as every"
4525,THE BREASTPLATE,"educated man knows, corslets were not yet in fashion. So we must have no"
4526,THE BREASTPLATE,"corslets in the _Odyssey_?"""
4527,THE BREASTPLATE,
4528,THE BREASTPLATE,"A modern critic, who thinks this possible, is bringing the practice"
4529,THE BREASTPLATE,of archaising poets of the late nineteenth century into the minds of
4530,THE BREASTPLATE,rhapsodists of the eighth century before Christ. Artists of the middle
4531,THE BREASTPLATE,of the sixteenth century always depict Jeanne d'Arc in the armour and
4532,THE BREASTPLATE,"costume of their own time, wholly unlike those of 1430. This is the"
4533,THE BREASTPLATE,regular rule. Late rhapsodists would not delve in the archaeology of the
4534,THE BREASTPLATE,"Mycenaean prime. Indeed, one does not see how they could discover, in"
4535,THE BREASTPLATE,"Asia, that corslets were not worn, five centuries earlier, on the other"
4536,THE BREASTPLATE,side of the sea.
4537,THE BREASTPLATE,
4538,THE BREASTPLATE,We are told that Aias and some other heroes are never spoken of as
4539,THE BREASTPLATE,wearing corslets. But Aias certainly did put on a set of pieces of
4540,THE BREASTPLATE,"armour, and did not trust to his shield alone, tower-like as it was. The"
4541,THE BREASTPLATE,"description runs thus: The Achaeans have disarmed, before the duel of"
4542,THE BREASTPLATE,"Aias and Hector. Aias draws the lucky lot; he is to 'meet Hector, and"
4543,THE BREASTPLATE,"bids the others pray to Zeus ""while I clothe me in my armour of battle."""
4544,THE BREASTPLATE,"While they prayed, Aias ""arrayed himself in flashing bronze. And when"
4545,THE BREASTPLATE,"he had now clothed upon his flesh _all_ his pieces of armour"" ([Greek:"
4546,THE BREASTPLATE,"panta teuchae]) ""he went forth to fight."" If Aias wore only a shield, as"
4547,THE BREASTPLATE,"on Mr. Leaf's hypothesis, he could sling it on before the Achaeans could"
4548,THE BREASTPLATE,breathe a _pater noster_. His sword he would not have taken off; swords
4549,THE BREASTPLATE,"were always worn. What, then, are ""all his pieces of armour""? (VII. 193,"
4550,THE BREASTPLATE,206).
4551,THE BREASTPLATE,
4552,THE BREASTPLATE,"Carl Robert cites passages in which the [Greek: teuchea], taken from"
4553,THE BREASTPLATE,"the shoulders, include corslets, and are late and Ionian, with other"
4554,THE BREASTPLATE,"passages which are Mycenaean, with no corslet involved. He adds about"
4555,THE BREASTPLATE,twenty more passages in which [Greek: teuchea] include corslets. Among
4556,THE BREASTPLATE,"these references two are from the _Doloneia_ (X. 254, 272), where"
4557,THE BREASTPLATE,Reichel finds no mention of corslets. How Robert can tell [Greek:
4558,THE BREASTPLATE,"teuchea], which mean corslets, from [Greek: teuchea], which exclude"
4559,THE BREASTPLATE,"corslets, is not obvious. But, at all events, he does see corslets, as"
4560,THE BREASTPLATE,"in VII. 122, where Reichel sees none, [Footnote: Robert, _Studien zur"
4561,THE BREASTPLATE,"Ilias_, pp. 20-21.] and he is obviously right."
4562,THE BREASTPLATE,
4563,THE BREASTPLATE,"It is a strong point with Mr. Leaf that ""we never hear of the corslet in"
4564,THE BREASTPLATE,"the case of Aias...."" [Footnote: Leaf, _Iliad_, vol. i. p. 576.] Robert,"
4565,THE BREASTPLATE,"however, like ourselves, detects the corslet among ""_al_ the [Greek:"
4566,THE BREASTPLATE,"teuchea]"" which Aias puts on for his duel with Hector (Iliad, VII. 193,"
4567,THE BREASTPLATE,206-207).
4568,THE BREASTPLATE,
4569,THE BREASTPLATE,"In the same Book (VII. 101-103, 122) the same difficulty occurs."
4570,THE BREASTPLATE,"Menelaus offers to fight Hector, and says, ""I will put on my harness"""
4571,THE BREASTPLATE,"[Greek: thooraxomai], and does ""put on his fair pieces of armour"""
4572,THE BREASTPLATE,"[Greek: teuchea kala], Agamemnon forbids him to fight, and his friends"
4573,THE BREASTPLATE,"""joyfully take his pieces of armour"" [Greek: teuchea] ""from his"
4574,THE BREASTPLATE,"shoulders"" (_Iliad_, VII. 206-207). They take off pieces of armour, in"
4575,THE BREASTPLATE,"the plural, and a shield cannot be spoken of in the plural; while the"
4576,THE BREASTPLATE,sword would not be taken off--it was worn even in peaceful costume.
4577,THE BREASTPLATE,
4578,THE BREASTPLATE,"Idomeneus is never named as wearing a corslet, but he remarks that he"
4579,THE BREASTPLATE,has plenty of corslets (XIII. 264); and in this and many cases opponents
4580,THE BREASTPLATE,of corslets prove their case by cutting out the lines which disprove it.
4581,THE BREASTPLATE,Anything may be demonstrated if we may excise whatever passage does
4582,THE BREASTPLATE,not suit our hypothesis. It is impossible to argue against this logical
4583,THE BREASTPLATE,"device, especially when the critic, not satisfied with a clean cut,"
4584,THE BREASTPLATE,supposes that some late enthusiast for corslets altered the prayer of
4585,THE BREASTPLATE,Thetis to Hephaestus for the very purpose of dragging in a corslet.
4586,THE BREASTPLATE,"[Footnote: Leaf, Note to _Iliad_, xviii. 460, 461.] If there is no"
4587,THE BREASTPLATE,"objection to a line except that a corslet occurs in it, where is the"
4588,THE BREASTPLATE,logic in excising the line because one happens to think that corslets
4589,THE BREASTPLATE,are later than the oldest parts of the _Iliad_?
4590,THE BREASTPLATE,
4591,THE BREASTPLATE,Another plan is to maintain that if the poet does not in any case
4592,THE BREASTPLATE,"mention a corslet, there was no corslet. Thus in V. 99, an arrow strikes"
4593,THE BREASTPLATE,"Diomede ""hard by the right shoulder, the plate of the corslet."" Thirteen"
4594,THE BREASTPLATE,"lines later (V. 112, 113) ""Sthenelus drew the swift shaft right through"
4595,THE BREASTPLATE,"out of Diomede's shoulder, and the blood darted up through the pliant"
4596,THE BREASTPLATE,"_chiton_."" We do not know what the word here translated ""pliant"" [Greek:"
4597,THE BREASTPLATE,"streptos] means, and Aristarchus seems to have thought it was ""a coat of"
4598,THE BREASTPLATE,"mail, chain, or scale armour."" If so, here is the corslet, but in this"
4599,THE BREASTPLATE,"case, if a corslet or jack with intertwisted small plates or scales or"
4600,THE BREASTPLATE,"rings of bronze be meant, _gualon_ cannot mean a large ""plate,"" as"
4601,THE BREASTPLATE,"it does. Mr. Ridgeway says, ""It seems certain that [Greek: streptos"
4602,THE BREASTPLATE,"chitoon] means, as Aristarchus held, a shirt of mail."" [Footnote: _Early"
4603,THE BREASTPLATE,"Age of Greece_, vol. i. p, 306.] Mr. Leaf says just the reverse. As"
4604,THE BREASTPLATE,"usual, we come to a deadlock; a clash of learned opinion. But any one"
4605,THE BREASTPLATE,"can see that, in the space of thirteen lines, no poet or interpolator"
4606,THE BREASTPLATE,"who wrote V. i 12, i 13 could forget that Diomede was said to be wearing"
4607,THE BREASTPLATE,"a corslet in V. 99; and even if the poet could forget, which is out of"
4608,THE BREASTPLATE,"the question, the editor of 540 B.C. was simply defrauding his employer,"
4609,THE BREASTPLATE,"Piaistratus, if he did not bring a remedy for the stupid fault of the"
4610,THE BREASTPLATE,poet. When this or that hero is not specifically said to be wearing a
4611,THE BREASTPLATE,"corslet, it is usually because the poet has no occasion to mention it,"
4612,THE BREASTPLATE,"though, as we have seen, a man is occasionally smitten, in the midriff,"
4613,THE BREASTPLATE,"say, without any remark on the flimsy piece of mail."
4614,THE BREASTPLATE,
4615,THE BREASTPLATE,"That corslets are usually taken for granted as present by the poet,"
4616,THE BREASTPLATE,"even when they are not explicitly named, seems certain. He constantly"
4617,THE BREASTPLATE,"represents the heroes as ""stripping the pieces of mail"" [Greek:"
4618,THE BREASTPLATE,"teuchea], when they have time and opportunity, from fallen foes. If only"
4619,THE BREASTPLATE,"the shield is taken, if there is nothing else in the way of bronze body"
4620,THE BREASTPLATE,"armour to take, why have we the plural, [Greek: teuchea]? The corslet,"
4621,THE BREASTPLATE,"as well as the shield, must be intended. The stripping is usually ""from"
4622,THE BREASTPLATE,"the shoulders,"" and it is ""from his shoulders"" that Hector hopes to"
4623,THE BREASTPLATE,"strip the corslet of Diomede (Iliad, VIII. 195) in a passage, to be"
4624,THE BREASTPLATE,"sure, which the critics think interpolated. However this may be, the"
4625,THE BREASTPLATE,"stripping of the (same Greek characters), cannot be the mere seizure of"
4626,THE BREASTPLATE,"the shield, but must refer to other pieces of armour: ""all the pieces"
4627,THE BREASTPLATE,"of armour."" So other pieces of defensive armour besides the shield are"
4628,THE BREASTPLATE,throughout taken for granted. If they were not there they could not be
4629,THE BREASTPLATE,"stripped. It is the chitons that Agamemnon does something to, in the"
4630,THE BREASTPLATE,"case of two fallen foes (_Iliad_, XI. 100), and Aristarchus thought that"
4631,THE BREASTPLATE,"these _chitons_ were corslets. But the passage is obscure. In _Iliad_,"
4632,THE BREASTPLATE,"XI. 373, when Diomede strips helmet from head, shield from shoulder,"
4633,THE BREASTPLATE,"corslet from breast of Agastrophus, Reichel was for excising the"
4634,THE BREASTPLATE,"corslet, because it was not mentioned when the hero was struck on the"
4635,THE BREASTPLATE,hip joint. I do not see that an inefficient corslet would protect the
4636,THE BREASTPLATE,"hip joint. To do that, in our eighteenth century cavalry armour, was the"
4637,THE BREASTPLATE,"business of a _zoster_, as may be seen in a portrait of the Chevalier de"
4638,THE BREASTPLATE,St. George in youth. It is a thick ribbed _zoster_ that protects the hip
4639,THE BREASTPLATE,joints of the king.
4640,THE BREASTPLATE,
4641,THE BREASTPLATE,"Finally, Mr. Evans observes that the western invaders of Egypt, under"
4642,THE BREASTPLATE,"Rameses III, are armed, on the monuments, with cuirasses formed of a"
4643,THE BREASTPLATE,"succession of plates, ""horizontal, or rising in a double curve,"" while"
4644,THE BREASTPLATE,"the Enkomi ivories, already referred to, corroborate the existence"
4645,THE BREASTPLATE,"of corslet, _zoster_, and _zoma_ as articles of defensive armour."
4646,THE BREASTPLATE,"[Footnote: _Journal of Anthropological Institute_, xxx. p. 213.] ""Recent"
4647,THE BREASTPLATE,"discoveries,"" says Mr. Evans, ""thus supply a double corroboration of the"
4648,THE BREASTPLATE,Homeric tradition which carries back the use of the round shield and the
4649,THE BREASTPLATE,cuirass or [Greek: thoraex] to the earlier epic period... With such
4650,THE BREASTPLATE,"a representation before us, a series of Homeric passages on which Dr."
4651,THE BREASTPLATE,"Reichel... has exhausted his powers of destructive criticism, becomes"
4652,THE BREASTPLATE,"readily intelligible."" [Footnote: Ibid., p. 214.]"
4653,THE BREASTPLATE,
4654,THE BREASTPLATE,"Homer, then, describes armour _later_ than that of the Mycenaean prime,"
4655,THE BREASTPLATE,"when, as far as works of art show, only a huge leathern shield was"
4656,THE BREASTPLATE,"carried, though the gold breastplates of the corpses in the grave"
4657,THE BREASTPLATE,"suggest that corslets existed. Homer's men, on the other hand, have,"
4658,THE BREASTPLATE,"at least in certain cases quoted above, large bronze-plated shields and"
4659,THE BREASTPLATE,"bronze cuirasses of no great resisting power, perhaps in various stages"
4660,THE BREASTPLATE,"of evolution, from the byrnie with scales or small plates of bronze to"
4661,THE BREASTPLATE,"the breastplate and backplate, though the plates for breast and back"
4662,THE BREASTPLATE,certainly appear to be usually worn.
4663,THE BREASTPLATE,
4664,THE BREASTPLATE,It seems that some critics cannot divest themselves of the idea that
4665,THE BREASTPLATE,"""the original poet"" of the ""kernel"" was contemporary with them who slept"
4666,THE BREASTPLATE,"in the shaft graves of Mycenae, covered with golden ornaments, and that"
4667,THE BREASTPLATE,for body armour he only knew their monstrous shields. Mr. Leaf writes:
4668,THE BREASTPLATE,"""The armour of Homeric heroes corresponds closely to that of the"
4669,THE BREASTPLATE,Mykenaean age as we learn it from the monuments. The heroes wore no
4670,THE BREASTPLATE,breastplate; their only defensive armour was the enormous Mykenaean
4671,THE BREASTPLATE,"shield...."""
4672,THE BREASTPLATE,
4673,THE BREASTPLATE,This is only true if we excise all the passages which contradict the
4674,THE BREASTPLATE,"statement, and go on with Mr. Leaf to say, ""by the seventh century B.C.,"
4675,THE BREASTPLATE,"or thereabouts, the idea of a panoply without a breastplate had become"
4676,THE BREASTPLATE,absurd. By that time the epic poems had almost ceased to grow; but they
4677,THE BREASTPLATE,"still admitted a few minor episodes in which the round shield"" (where"
4678,THE BREASTPLATE,"(?) ""and corslet played a part, as well as the interpolation of a certain"
4679,THE BREASTPLATE,number of lines and couplets in which the new armament was mechanically
4680,THE BREASTPLATE,"introduced into narratives which originally knew nothing of it."""
4681,THE BREASTPLATE,"[Footnote: _Iliad_, vol. i. p. 568.]"
4682,THE BREASTPLATE,
4683,THE BREASTPLATE,"On the other hand, Mr. Leaf says that ""the small circular shield of"
4684,THE BREASTPLATE,"later times is unknown to Homer,"" with ""a very few curious exceptions,"""
4685,THE BREASTPLATE,in which the shields are not said to be small or circular. [Footnote:
4686,THE BREASTPLATE,"_Iliad_, vol. i. p, 575.]"
4687,THE BREASTPLATE,
4688,THE BREASTPLATE,Surely this is rather arbitrary dealing! We start from our theory that
4689,THE BREASTPLATE,"the original poet described the armour of ""the monuments"" though"
4690,THE BREASTPLATE,"_they_ are ""of the prime,"" while he professedly lived long after the"
4691,THE BREASTPLATE,prime--lived in an age when there must have been changes in military
4692,THE BREASTPLATE,"equipment. We then cut out, as of the seventh century, whatever passages"
4693,THE BREASTPLATE,do not suit our theory. Anybody can prove anything by this method. We
4694,THE BREASTPLATE,might say that the siege scene on the Mycenaean silver vase represents
4695,THE BREASTPLATE,"the Mycenaean prime, and that, as there is but one jersey among"
4696,THE BREASTPLATE,"eight men otherwise stark naked, we must cut out seven-eighths of the"
4697,THE BREASTPLATE,"_chitons_ in the _Iliad_, these having been interpolated by late poets"
4698,THE BREASTPLATE,who did not run about with nothing on. We might call the whole poem
4699,THE BREASTPLATE,"late, because the authors know nothing of the Mycenaean bathing-drawers"
4700,THE BREASTPLATE,"so common on the ""monuments."" The argument compels Mr. Leaf to assume"
4701,THE BREASTPLATE,"that a shield can be called [Greek: teuchea] in the plural, so, in"
4702,THE BREASTPLATE,"_Iliad_, VII. 122, when the squires of Menelaus ""take the [Greek:"
4703,THE BREASTPLATE,"teuchea] from his shoulders,"" we are assured that ""the shield (aspis)"
4704,THE BREASTPLATE,"was for the chiefs alone"" (we have seen that all the host of Pandarus"
4705,THE BREASTPLATE,"wore shields), ""for those who could keep a chariot to carry them, and"
4706,THE BREASTPLATE,"squires to assist them in taking off this ponderous defence"" (see VII"
4707,THE BREASTPLATE,"122). [Footnote: _Iliad_, vol. i. p. 583.]"
4708,THE BREASTPLATE,
4709,THE BREASTPLATE,"We do ""see VII. 122,"" and find that not a _single_ shield, but pieces of"
4710,THE BREASTPLATE,gear in the plural number were taken off Menelaus. The feeblest warrior
4711,THE BREASTPLATE,without any assistance could stoop his head and put it through the belt
4712,THE BREASTPLATE,"of his shield, as an angler takes off his fishing creel, and there he"
4713,THE BREASTPLATE,"was, totally disarmed. No squire was needed to disarm him, any more"
4714,THE BREASTPLATE,than to disarm Girard in the _Chancun de Willame_. Nobody explains why
4715,THE BREASTPLATE,"a shield is spoken of as a number of things, in the plural, and that"
4716,THE BREASTPLATE,"constantly, and in lines where, if the poet means a shield, prosody"
4717,THE BREASTPLATE,"permits him to _say_ a shield, [Greek: therapontes ap oopoon aspid"
4718,THE BREASTPLATE,elonto].
4719,THE BREASTPLATE,
4720,THE BREASTPLATE,"It really does appear that Reichel's logic, his power of visualising"
4721,THE BREASTPLATE,"simple things and processes, and his knowledge of the evolution"
4722,THE BREASTPLATE,"of defensive armour everywhere, were not equal to his industry and"
4723,THE BREASTPLATE,"classical erudition. Homer seems to describe what he saw: shields, often"
4724,THE BREASTPLATE,"of great size, made of leather, plated with bronze, and suspended by"
4725,THE BREASTPLATE,"belts; and, for body armour, feeble bronze corslets and _zosters_. There"
4726,THE BREASTPLATE,is nothing inconsistent in all this: there was no more reason why an
4727,THE BREASTPLATE,Homeric warrior should not wear a corslet as well as a shield than there
4728,THE BREASTPLATE,was reason why a mediaeval knight who carried a _targe_ should not also
4729,THE BREASTPLATE,"wear a hauberk, or why an Iroquois with a shield should not also"
4730,THE BREASTPLATE,wear his cotton or wicker-work armour. Defensive gear kept pace with
4731,THE BREASTPLATE,offensive weapons. A big leather shield could keep out stone-tipped
4732,THE BREASTPLATE,arrows; but as bronze-tipped arrows came in and also heavy
4733,THE BREASTPLATE,"bronze-pointed spears, defensive armour was necessarily strengthened;"
4734,THE BREASTPLATE,"the shield was plated with bronze, and, if it did not exist before, the"
4735,THE BREASTPLATE,bronze corslet was developed.
4736,THE BREASTPLATE,
4737,THE BREASTPLATE,To keep out stone-tipped arrows was the business of the Mycenaean wooden
4738,THE BREASTPLATE,"or leather shield. ""Bronze arrow-heads, so common in the _Iliad_,"
4739,THE BREASTPLATE,"are never found,"" says Schuchardt, speaking of Schliemann's Mycenaean"
4740,THE BREASTPLATE,"excavations. [Footnote: Schuchardt, p. 237.]"
4741,THE BREASTPLATE,
4742,THE BREASTPLATE,"There was thus, as far as arrows went, no reason why Mycenaean shields"
4743,THE BREASTPLATE,should be plated with bronze. If the piece of wood in Grave V. was a
4744,THE BREASTPLATE,"shield, as seems probable, what has become of its bronze plates, if it"
4745,THE BREASTPLATE,"had any? [Footnote: Schuchardt, p. 269] Gold ornaments, which could only"
4746,THE BREASTPLATE,"belong to shields, [Footnote: _Ibid_., p. 237.] were found, but bronze"
4747,THE BREASTPLATE,shield plates never. The inference is certain. The Mycenaean shields
4748,THE BREASTPLATE,of the prime were originally wooden or leather defences against
4749,THE BREASTPLATE,stone-headed arrows. Homer's shields are bronze-plated shields to keep
4750,THE BREASTPLATE,"out bronze-headed or even, perhaps, iron-pointed arrows of primitive"
4751,THE BREASTPLATE,construction (IV. 123). Homer describes armour based on Mycenaean lines
4752,THE BREASTPLATE,but developed and advanced as the means of attack improved.
4753,THE BREASTPLATE,
4754,THE BREASTPLATE,Where everything is so natural it seems fantastic to explain the
4755,THE BREASTPLATE,circumstances by the theory that poets in a late age sometimes did
4756,THE BREASTPLATE,and sometimes did not interpolate the military gear of four centuries
4757,THE BREASTPLATE,"posterior to the things known by the original singer. These rhapsodists,"
4758,THE BREASTPLATE,"we reiterate, are now said to be anxiously conservative of Mycenaean"
4759,THE BREASTPLATE,"detail and even to be deeply learned archaeologists. [Footnote: Leaf,"
4760,THE BREASTPLATE,"_Iliad_, vol. ii. p. 629.] At other times they are said to introduce"
4761,THE BREASTPLATE,"recklessly part of the military gear of their own age, the corslets,"
4762,THE BREASTPLATE,while sternly excluding the bucklers. All depends on what the theory of
4763,THE BREASTPLATE,very late developments of the Epic may happen to demand at this or that
4764,THE BREASTPLATE,moment.
4765,THE BREASTPLATE,
4766,THE BREASTPLATE,"Again, Mr. Leaf informs us that ""the first rhapsodies were born in the"
4767,THE BREASTPLATE,"bronze age, in the day of the ponderous Mycenaean shield; the last in"
4768,THE BREASTPLATE,"the iron age, when men armed themselves with breastplate and light round"
4769,THE BREASTPLATE,"buckler."" [Footnote: _Ibid_., vol. ii. p. x.] We cannot guess how he"
4770,THE BREASTPLATE,"found these things out, for corslets are as common in one ""rhapsody"" as"
4771,THE BREASTPLATE,"in another when circumstances call for the mention of corslets, and"
4772,THE BREASTPLATE,are entirely unnamed in the Odyssey (save that the Achaeans are
4773,THE BREASTPLATE,"""bronze-chitoned""), while the Odyssey is alleged to be much later than"
4774,THE BREASTPLATE,"the _Iliad_. As for ""the iron age,"" no ""rhapsodist"" introduces so"
4775,THE BREASTPLATE,much as one iron spear point. It is argued that he speaks of bronze in
4776,THE BREASTPLATE,deference to tradition. Then why does he scout tradition in the matter
4777,THE BREASTPLATE,"of greaves and corslets, while he sometimes actually goes behind"
4778,THE BREASTPLATE,tradition to find Mycenaean things unknown to the original poets?
4779,THE BREASTPLATE,
4780,THE BREASTPLATE,These theories appear too strangely inconsistent; really these theories
4781,THE BREASTPLATE,"cannot possibly be accepted. The late poets, of the theory, are in"
4782,THE BREASTPLATE,"the iron age, and are, of course, familiar with iron weapons; yet, in"
4783,THE BREASTPLATE,"conservative deference to tradition, they keep them absolutely out of"
4784,THE BREASTPLATE,"their rhapsodies. They are equally familiar with bronze corslets, so,"
4785,THE BREASTPLATE,"reckless this time of tradition, they thrust them even into rhapsodies"
4786,THE BREASTPLATE,which are centuries older than their own day. They are no less familiar
4787,THE BREASTPLATE,"with small bucklers, yet they say nothing about them and cling to"
4788,THE BREASTPLATE,the traditional body-covering shield. The source of the inconsistent
4789,THE BREASTPLATE,theories which we have been examining is easily discovered. The scholars
4790,THE BREASTPLATE,who hold these opinions see that several things in the Homeric picture
4791,THE BREASTPLATE,"of life are based on Mycenaean facts; for example, the size of the"
4792,THE BREASTPLATE,shields and their suspension by baldrics. But the scholars also do
4793,THE BREASTPLATE,"steadfastly believe, following the Wolfian tradition, that there could"
4794,THE BREASTPLATE,"be no _long_ epic in the early period. Therefore the greater part, much"
4795,THE BREASTPLATE,"the greater part of the _Iliad_, must necessarily, they say, be the work"
4796,THE BREASTPLATE,of continuators through several centuries. Critics are fortified in
4797,THE BREASTPLATE,"this belief by the discovery of inconsistencies in the Epic, which,"
4798,THE BREASTPLATE,"they assume, can only be explained as the result of a compilation of the"
4799,THE BREASTPLATE,"patchwork of ages. But as, on this theory, many men in many lands and"
4800,THE BREASTPLATE,"ages made the Epic, their contributions cannot but be marked by the"
4801,THE BREASTPLATE,"inevitable changes in manners, customs, beliefs, implements, laws,"
4802,THE BREASTPLATE,"weapons, and so on, which could not but arise in the long process of"
4803,THE BREASTPLATE,"time. Yet traces of change in law, religion, manners, and customs are"
4804,THE BREASTPLATE,"scarcely, if at all, to be detected; whence it logically follows that a"
4805,THE BREASTPLATE,dozen generations of irresponsible minstrels and vagrant reciters were
4806,THE BREASTPLATE,"learned, conscientious, and staunchly conservative of the archaic tone."
4807,THE BREASTPLATE,"Their erudite conservatism, for example, induced them, in deference to"
4808,THE BREASTPLATE,"the traditions of the bronze age, to describe all weapons as of bronze,"
4809,THE BREASTPLATE,though many of the poets were living in an age of weapons of iron. It
4810,THE BREASTPLATE,also prompted them to describe all shields as made on the far-away old
4811,THE BREASTPLATE,"Mycenaean model, though they were themselves used to small circular"
4812,THE BREASTPLATE,"bucklers, with a bracer and a grip, worn on the left arm."
4813,THE BREASTPLATE,
4814,THE BREASTPLATE,But at this point the learning and conservatism of the late poets
4815,THE BREASTPLATE,"deserted them, and into their new lays, also into the old lays, they"
4816,THE BREASTPLATE,eagerly introduced many unwarrantable corslets and greaves--things of
4817,THE BREASTPLATE,"the ninth to seventh centuries. We shall find Helbig stating, on the"
4818,THE BREASTPLATE,"same page, that in the matter of usages ""the epic poets shunned, as far"
4819,THE BREASTPLATE,"as possible, all that was recent,"" and also that for fear of puzzling"
4820,THE BREASTPLATE,"their military audiences they did the reverse: ""they probably kept"
4821,THE BREASTPLATE,"account of the arms and armour of their own day."" [Footnote: La"
4822,THE BREASTPLATE,"_Question Mycénienne_, p. 50. _Cf_. Note I.] Now the late poets, on"
4823,THE BREASTPLATE,"this showing, must have puzzled warriors who used iron weapons by always"
4824,THE BREASTPLATE,"speaking of bronze weapons. They pleased the critical warriors, on the"
4825,THE BREASTPLATE,"other hand, by introducing the corslets and greaves which every military"
4826,THE BREASTPLATE,"man of their late age possessed. But, again, the poets startled an"
4827,THE BREASTPLATE,"audience which used light bucklers, worn on the left arm, by talking of"
4828,THE BREASTPLATE,"enormous _targes_, slung round the neck."
4829,THE BREASTPLATE,
4830,THE BREASTPLATE,All these inconsistencies of theory follow from the assumption that the
4831,THE BREASTPLATE,"_Iliad_ _must_ be a hotch-potch of many ages. If we assume that, on the"
4832,THE BREASTPLATE,"whole, it is the work of one age, we see that the poet describes the"
4833,THE BREASTPLATE,"usages which obtained in his own day. The dead are cremated, not, as in"
4834,THE BREASTPLATE,"the Mycenaean prime, inhumed. The shield has been strengthened to meet"
4835,THE BREASTPLATE,"bronze, not stone-tipped, arrows by bronze plates. Corslets and greaves"
4836,THE BREASTPLATE,"have been elaborated. Bronze, however, is still the metal for swords and"
4837,THE BREASTPLATE,"spears, and even occasionally for tools and implements, though these are"
4838,THE BREASTPLATE,"often of iron. In short, we have in Homer a picture of a transitional"
4839,THE BREASTPLATE,"age of culture; we have not a medley of old and new, of obsolete and"
4840,THE BREASTPLATE,"modern. The poets do not describe inhumation, as they should do, if they"
4841,THE BREASTPLATE,"are conservative archaeologists. In that case, though they burn, they"
4842,THE BREASTPLATE,"would have made their heroes bury their dead, as they did at Mycenas."
4843,THE BREASTPLATE,"They do not introduce iron swords and spears, as they must do, if, being"
4844,THE BREASTPLATE,"late poets, they keep in touch with the armament of their time. If they"
4845,THE BREASTPLATE,"speak of huge shields only because they are conservative archaeologists,"
4846,THE BREASTPLATE,"then, on the other hand, they speak of corslets and greaves because they"
4847,THE BREASTPLATE,are also reckless innovators.
4848,THE BREASTPLATE,
4849,THE BREASTPLATE,"They cannot be both at once. They are depicting a single age, a single"
4850,THE BREASTPLATE,"""moment in culture."" That age is certainly sundered from the Mycenaean"
4851,THE BREASTPLATE,prime by the century or two in which changing ideas led to the
4852,THE BREASTPLATE,"superseding of burial by burning, or it is sundered from the Mycenaean"
4853,THE BREASTPLATE,"prime by a foreign conquest, a revolution, and the years in which the"
4854,THE BREASTPLATE,foreign conquerors acquired the language of their subjects.
4855,THE BREASTPLATE,
4856,THE BREASTPLATE,"In either alternative, and one or other must be actual, there was time"
4857,THE BREASTPLATE,enough for many changes in the culture of the Mycenaean prime to be
4858,THE BREASTPLATE,"evolved. These changes, we say, are represented by the descriptions of"
4859,THE BREASTPLATE,"culture in the Iliad. That hypothesis explains, simply and readily, all"
4860,THE BREASTPLATE,"the facts. The other hypothesis, that the _Iliad_ was begun near the"
4861,THE BREASTPLATE,"Mycenaean prime and was continued throughout four or five centuries,"
4862,THE BREASTPLATE,"cannot, first, explain how the _Iliad_ was _composed_, and, next,"
4863,THE BREASTPLATE,it wanders among apparent contradictories and through a maze of
4864,THE BREASTPLATE,inconsistencies.

4870,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE",We are far from contending that it is always possible to
4871,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE",understand Homer's descriptions of defensive armour. But as we have
4872,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","never seen the actual objects, perhaps the poet's phrases were clear"
4873,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","enough to his audience and are only difficult to us. I do not, for"
4874,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","example, profess to be sure of what happened when Pandarus shot at"
4875,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","Menelaus. The arrow lighted ""where the golden buckles of the _zoster_"
4876,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","were clasped, and the doubled breastplate met them. So the bitter arrow"
4877,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","alighted upon the firm _zoster_; through the wrought _zoster_ it sped,"
4878,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","and through the curiously wrought breastplate it pressed on, and through"
4879,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","the _mitre_ he wore to shield his flesh, a barrier against darts; and"
4880,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","this best shielded him, yet it passed on even through this,"" and grazed"
4881,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","the hero's flesh (_Iliad_, IV. I 32 seq.). Menelaus next says that ""the"
4882,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","glistering _zoster_ in front stayed the dart, and the _zoma_ beneath,"
4883,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","and the _mitrê_ that the coppersmiths fashioned"" (IV. 185-187). Then the"
4884,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","surgeon, Machaon, ""loosed the glistering _zoster_ and the _zoma_, and"
4885,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","the _mitrê_ beneath that the coppersmiths fashioned"" (IV. 215, 216)."
4886,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE",
4887,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE",Reading as a mere student of poetry I take this to mean that the corslet
4888,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","was of two pieces, fastening in the middle of the back and the middle of"
4889,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE",the front of a man (though Mr. Monro thinks that the plates met and the
4890,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","_zoster_ was buckled at the side); that the _zoster_, a mailed belt,"
4891,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE",buckled just above the place where the plates of the corslet met; that
4892,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","the arrow went through the meeting-place of the belt buckles, through"
4893,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","the place where the plates of the corslet met, and then through the"
4894,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","_mitrê_, a piece of bronze armour worn under the corslet, though the"
4895,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE",nature of this _mitrê_ and of the _zoma_ I do not know. Was the _mitrê_
4896,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","a separate article or a continuation of the breastplate, lower down,"
4897,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE",struck by a dropping arrow?
4898,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE",
4899,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","In 1883 Mr. Leaf wrote: ""I take it that the _zoma_ means the waist of"

4901,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE",of the _mitrê_ or plated apron beneath it fastened round the warrior's

4914,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","that ""Homer"" saw small round bucklers in use, and supposed that the old"

4931,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","Leaf suggests, first, the abandonment of the huge shield, with the"
4932,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","introduction of small round bucklers in its place. Then, second, a man"
4933,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","naturally felt very unprotected, and put on ""the metallic _mitrê_"" of"

4939,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","were flying thick, as they do fly in the _Iliad_, men would not reject"
4940,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE",body-covering shields for small bucklers while they were still wholly
4941,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","destitute of body armour. Nor would men arm only their stomachs when,"
4942,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","if they had skill enough to make a metallic _mitrê_, they could not have"
4943,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE",been so unskilled as to be unable to make corslets of some more or
4944,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","less serviceable type. Probably they began with huge shields, added the"
4945,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","_linothorex_ (like the Iroquois cotton _thorex_), and next, as a rule,"
4946,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","superseded that with the bronze _thorex_, while retaining the huge"
4947,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","shield, because the bronze _thorex_ was so inadequate to its purpose of"
4948,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","defence. Then, when archery ceased to be of so much importance as coming"
4949,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","to the shock with heavy spears, and as the bronze _thorex_ really could"
4950,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","sometimes keep out an arrow, they reduced the size of their shields, and"
4951,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE",retained surface enough for parrying spears and meeting point and edge
4952,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE","of the sword. That appears to be a natural set of sequences, but I"

4973,"HELMETS, GREAVES, SPEARS","wears a leather cap. The three spies put on no corslets, as far as we"
4974,"HELMETS, GREAVES, SPEARS","can affirm, their object being to remain inconspicuous and unburdened"
4975,"HELMETS, GREAVES, SPEARS",with glittering bronze greaves and corslets. The Trojan camp was
4976,"HELMETS, GREAVES, SPEARS","brilliantly lit up with fires, and there may have been a moon, so the"
4977,"HELMETS, GREAVES, SPEARS",less bronze the better. In these circumstances alone the heroes of the
4978,"HELMETS, GREAVES, SPEARS","Iliad are unequipped, certainly, with bronze helmets, corslets,"
4979,"HELMETS, GREAVES, SPEARS","and bronze greaves. [Dislocated Footnote: Evans, _Journal of the"

4985,"HELMETS, GREAVES, SPEARS","but that leather caps with boars' tusks were in fashion; while again, as"
4986,"HELMETS, GREAVES, SPEARS","we shall see, he is said to know nothing about heroic costume (cf. The"

4999,GREAVES,"Bronze greaves are not found, so far, in Mycenaean tombs in"
5000,GREAVES,"Greece, and Reichel argued that the original Homer knew none. The"
5001,GREAVES,"greaves, [Greek: kunmides] ""were gaiters of stuff or leather""; the one"
5002,GREAVES,mention of bronze greaves is stuff and nonsense interpolated (VII. 41).
5003,GREAVES,But why did men who were interpolating bronze corslets freely introduce
5004,GREAVES,"bronze so seldom, if at all, as the material of greaves?"
5005,GREAVES,
5006,GREAVES,"Bronze greaves, however, have been found in a Cypro-Mycenaean grave at"
5007,GREAVES,"Enkomi (Tomb XV.), _accompanied_ by _an early type_ of _bronze_ dagger,"
5008,GREAVES,while bronze greaves adorned with Mycenaean ornament are discovered in
5009,GREAVES,"the Balkan peninsula at Glassinavç. [Footnote: Evans, _Journal of the"
5010,GREAVES,"Anthropological Institute,_ pp. 214, 215, figs. 10, 11.] Thus all Homer's"
5011,GREAVES,"description of arms is here corroborated by archaeology, and cannot be"
5012,GREAVES,"cut out by what Mr. Evans calls ""the Procrustean method"" of Dr. Reichel."
5013,GREAVES,
5014,GREAVES,A curious feature about the spear may be noticed. In Book X. while the
5015,GREAVES,"men of Diomede slept, ""their spears were driven into the ground erect"
5016,GREAVES,"on the spikes of the butts"" (X. 153). Aristotle mentions that this was"
5017,GREAVES,"still the usage of the Illyrians in his day. [Footnote: _Poctica_,"
5018,GREAVES,25.] Though the word for the spike in the butt (_sauroter_) does not
5019,GREAVES,"elsewhere occur in the _Iliad_, the practice of sticking the spears"
5020,GREAVES,"erect in the ground during a truce is mentioned in III. 135: ""They lean"
5021,GREAVES,"upon their shields"" (clearly large high shields), ""and the tall spears"
5022,GREAVES,"are planted by their sides."" No butt-spikes have been found in graves of"
5023,GREAVES,"the Mycenaean prime. The _sauroter_ was still used, or still existed, in"
5024,GREAVES,"the days of Herodotus. [Footnote: Tsountas and Manatt, p. 205; Ridgeway,"
5025,GREAVES,"vol. i. pp. 306, 307.]"
5026,GREAVES,
5027,GREAVES,"On the whole, Homer does not offer a medley of the military gear of"
5028,GREAVES,four centuries--that view we hope to have shown to be a mass of
5029,GREAVES,inconsistencies--but describes a state of military equipment in advance
5030,GREAVES,"of that of the most famous Mycenaean graves, but other than that of the"
5031,GREAVES,"late ""warrior vase."" He is also very familiar with some uses of iron, of"
5032,GREAVES,"which, as we shall see, scarcely any has been found in Mycenaean graves"
5033,GREAVES,"of the central period, save in the shape of rings. Homer never mentions"
5034,GREAVES,rings of any metal.

5043,BRONZE AND IRON,
5044,BRONZE AND IRON,"Taking the Iliad and Odyssey just as they have reached us they give,"
5045,BRONZE AND IRON,"with the exception of one line, an entirely harmonious account of the"
5046,BRONZE AND IRON,contemporary uses of bronze and iron. Bronze is employed in the making
5047,BRONZE AND IRON,"of weapons and armour (with cups, ornaments, &c.); iron is employed"
5048,BRONZE AND IRON,"(and bronze is also used) in the making of tools and implements, such"
5049,BRONZE AND IRON,"as knives, axes, adzes, axles of a chariot (that of Hera; mortals use"
5050,BRONZE AND IRON,"an axle tree of oak), and the various implements of agricultural and"
5051,BRONZE AND IRON,"pastoral life. Meanwhile, iron is a substance perfectly familiar to the"
5052,BRONZE AND IRON,poets; it is far indeed from being a priceless rarity (it is impossible
5053,BRONZE AND IRON,"to trace Homeric stages of advance in knowledge of iron), and it yields"
5054,BRONZE AND IRON,"epithets indicating strength, permanence, and stubborn endurance. These"
5055,BRONZE AND IRON,"epithets are more frequent in the Odyssey and the ""later"" Books of the"
5056,BRONZE AND IRON,"Iliad than in the ""earlier"" Books of the Iliad; but, as articles made"
5057,BRONZE AND IRON,"of iron, the Odyssey happens to mention only one set of axes, which is"
5058,BRONZE AND IRON,"spoken of ten times--axes and adzes as a class--and ""iron bonds,"" where"
5059,BRONZE AND IRON,"""iron"" probably means ""strong,"" ""not to be broken."" [Footnote: In these"
5060,BRONZE AND IRON,"circumstances, it is curious that Mr. Monro should have written thus:"
5061,BRONZE AND IRON,"""In Homer, as is well known, iron is rarely mentioned in comparison"
5062,BRONZE AND IRON,"with bronze, but the proportion is greater in the Odyssey (25 iron, 80"
5063,BRONZE AND IRON,"bronze) than in the Iliad"" (23 iron, 279 bronze).--Monro, Odyssey, vol."
5064,BRONZE AND IRON,"ii. p. 339. These statistics obviously do not prove that, at the date"
5065,BRONZE AND IRON,"of the composition of the Odyssey, the use of iron was becoming more"
5066,BRONZE AND IRON,"common, or that the use of bronze was becoming more rare, than when the"
5067,BRONZE AND IRON,"_Iliad_ was put together. Bronze is, in the poems, the military metal:"
5068,BRONZE AND IRON,"the _Iliad_ is a military poem, while the _Odyssey_ is an epic of peace;"
5069,BRONZE AND IRON,consequently the _Iliad_ is much more copious in references to bronze
5070,BRONZE AND IRON,than the _Odyssey_ has any occasion to be. Wives are far more frequently
5071,BRONZE AND IRON,"mentioned in the Odyssey than in the _Iliad_, but nobody will argue that"
5072,BRONZE AND IRON,"therefore marriage had recently come more into vogue. Again, the method"
5073,BRONZE AND IRON,"of counting up references to iron in the Odyssey is quite misleading,"
5074,BRONZE AND IRON,when we remember that ten out of the twenty references are only _one_
5075,BRONZE AND IRON,reference to one and the same set of iron tools-axes. Mr. Monro also
5076,BRONZE AND IRON,proposed to leave six references to iron in the _Iliad_ out of the
5077,BRONZE AND IRON,"reckoning, ""as all of them are in lines which can be omitted without"
5078,BRONZE AND IRON,"detriment to the sense."" Most of the six are in a recurrent epic formula"
5079,BRONZE AND IRON,"descriptive of a wealthy man, who possesses iron, as well as bronze,"
5080,BRONZE AND IRON,"gold, and women. The existence of the formula proves familiarity with"
5081,BRONZE AND IRON,"iron, and to excise it merely because it contradicts a theory is purely"
5082,BRONZE AND IRON,"arbitrary.--Monro, Odyssey, vol. ii. p. 339.]. The statement of facts"
5083,BRONZE AND IRON,given here is much akin to Helbig's account of the uses of bronze and
5084,BRONZE AND IRON,"iron in Homer. [Footnote: Helbig, _Das Homerischi Epos_, pp. 330, 331."
5085,BRONZE AND IRON,"_1887_.] Helbig writes: ""It is notable that in the Epic there is much"
5086,BRONZE AND IRON,more frequent mention of iron _implements_ than of iron _weapons of
5087,BRONZE AND IRON,"war_."" He then gives examples, which we produce later, and especially"
5088,BRONZE AND IRON,remarks on what Achilles says when he offers a mass of iron as a prize
5089,BRONZE AND IRON,"in the funeral games of Patroclus. The iron, says Achilles, will serve"
5090,BRONZE AND IRON,"for the purposes of the ploughman and shepherd, ""a surprising speech"
5091,BRONZE AND IRON,"from the son of Peleus, from whom we rather expect an allusion to the"
5092,BRONZE AND IRON,"military uses of the metal."" Of course, if iron weapons were not in"
5093,BRONZE AND IRON,"vogue while iron was the metal for tools and implements, the words of"
5094,BRONZE AND IRON,Achilles are appropriate and intelligible.
5095,BRONZE AND IRON,
5096,BRONZE AND IRON,"The facts being as we and Helbig agree in stating them, we suppose that"
5097,BRONZE AND IRON,the Homeric poets sing of the usages of their own time. It is an age
5098,BRONZE AND IRON,"when iron, though quite familiar, is not yet employed for armour, or"
5099,BRONZE AND IRON,"for swords or spears, which must be of excellent temper, without great"
5100,BRONZE AND IRON,weight in proportion to their length and size. Iron is only employed in
5101,BRONZE AND IRON,"Homer for some knives, which are never said to be used in battle"
5102,BRONZE AND IRON,"(not even for dealing the final stab, like the mediaeval poniard, the"
5103,BRONZE AND IRON,"_miséricorde_), for axes, which have a short cutting edge, and may be"
5104,BRONZE AND IRON,"thick and weighty behind the edge, and for the rough implements of the"
5105,BRONZE AND IRON,"shepherd and ploughman, such as tips of ploughshares, of goads, and so"
5106,BRONZE AND IRON,forth.
5107,BRONZE AND IRON,
5108,BRONZE AND IRON,"As far as archaeological excavations and discoveries enlighten us, these"
5109,BRONZE AND IRON,relative uses of bronze and iron did not exist in the ages of Mycenaean
5110,BRONZE AND IRON,"culture which are represented in the _tholos_ of Vaphio and the graves,"
5111,BRONZE AND IRON,"earlier and later, of Mycenae. Even in the later Mycenaean graves iron"
5112,BRONZE AND IRON,is found only in the form of finger rings (iron rings were common in
5113,BRONZE AND IRON,"late Greece). [Footnote: Tsountas and Manatt, pp. 72, 146, 165.] Iron"
5114,BRONZE AND IRON,was scarce in the Cypro-Mycenaean graves of Enkomi. A small knife with
5115,BRONZE AND IRON,a carved handle had left traces of an iron blade. A couple of lumps
5116,BRONZE AND IRON,"of iron, one of them apparently the head of a club, were found"
5117,BRONZE AND IRON,"in Schliemann's ""Burned City"" at Hissarlik; for the rest, swords,"
5118,BRONZE AND IRON,"spear-heads, knives, and axes are all of bronze in the age called"
5119,BRONZE AND IRON,"""Mycenaean."" But we do not know whether iron _implements_ may not yet"
5120,BRONZE AND IRON,"be found in the sepulchres of _Thetes_, and other poor and landless"
5121,BRONZE AND IRON,men. The latest discoveries in Minoan graves in Crete exhibit tools of
5122,BRONZE AND IRON,bronze.
5123,BRONZE AND IRON,
5124,BRONZE AND IRON,"Iron, we repeat, is in the poems a perfectly familiar metal. Ownership"
5125,BRONZE AND IRON,"of ""bronze, gold, and iron, which requires much labour"" (in the"
5126,BRONZE AND IRON,"smithying or smelting), appears regularly in the recurrent epic formula"
5127,BRONZE AND IRON,"for describing a man of wealth. [Footnote: _Iliad_, VI. 48; IX. 365-366;"
5128,BRONZE AND IRON,"X. 379; XI. 133; _Odyssey_, XIV. 324; XXI. 10.] Iron, bronze, slaves,"
5129,BRONZE AND IRON,and hides are bartered for sea-borne wine at the siege of Troy?
5130,BRONZE AND IRON,"[Footnote: _Iliad_, VII. 472-475.] Athene, disguised as Mentes, is"
5131,BRONZE AND IRON,"carrying a cargo of iron to Temesa (Tamasus in Cyprus?), to barter for"
5132,BRONZE AND IRON,copper. The poets are certainly not describing an age in which only a
5133,BRONZE AND IRON,man of wealth might indulge in the rare and extravagant luxury of an
5134,BRONZE AND IRON,"iron ring: iron was a common commodity, like cattle, hides, slaves,"
5135,BRONZE AND IRON,"bronze, and other such matters. Common as it was, Homer never once"
5136,BRONZE AND IRON,"mentions its use for defensive armour, or for swords and spears."
5137,BRONZE AND IRON,
5138,BRONZE AND IRON,Only in two cases does Homer describe any weapon as of iron. There is to
5139,BRONZE AND IRON,"be sure the ""iron,"" the knife with which Antilochus fears Achilles will"
5140,BRONZE AND IRON,cut his own throat. [Footnote: _Iliad_ XVIII. 34.] But no knife is ever
5141,BRONZE AND IRON,used as a weapon of war: knives are employed in cutting the throats of
5142,BRONZE AND IRON,"victims (see _Iliad_, III. 271 and XXIII. 30); the knife is said to be"
5143,BRONZE AND IRON,"of iron, in this last passage; also Patroclus uses the knife to cut the"
5144,BRONZE AND IRON,"arrow-head out of the flesh of a wounded friend. [Footnote: _Iliad_, XI."
5145,BRONZE AND IRON,"844.] It is the _knife_ of Achilles that is called ""the iron,"" and on"
5146,BRONZE AND IRON,"""the iron"" perish the cattle in _Iliad_, XXIII. 30. Mr. Leaf says that"
5147,BRONZE AND IRON,"by ""the usual use, the metal"" (iron) ""is confined to tools of small"
5148,BRONZE AND IRON,"size."" [Footnote: Leaf, _Iliad_, xxiii. 30, Note.] This is incorrect;"
5149,BRONZE AND IRON,the Odyssey speaks of _great axes_ habitually made of iron. [Footnote:
5150,BRONZE AND IRON,"Odyssey, IX. 391.] But we do find a knife of bronze, that of Agamemnon,"
5151,BRONZE AND IRON,"used in sacrificing victims; at least so I infer from Iliad, III."
5152,BRONZE AND IRON,271-292.
5153,BRONZE AND IRON,
5154,BRONZE AND IRON,The only two specimens of _weapons_ named by Homer as of iron are one
5155,BRONZE AND IRON,"arrow-head, used by Pandarus, [Footnote: _Iliad_, IV. 123.] and one"
5156,BRONZE AND IRON,"mace, borne, before Nestor's time, by Areithöus. To fight with an iron"
5157,BRONZE AND IRON,"mace was an amiable and apparently unique eccentricity of Areithbus, and"
5158,BRONZE AND IRON,"caused his death. On account of his peculiar practice he was named ""The"
5159,BRONZE AND IRON,"Mace man."" [Footnote: Iliad, VII. 141.] The case is mentioned by Nestor"
5160,BRONZE AND IRON,as curious and unusual.
5161,BRONZE AND IRON,
5162,BRONZE AND IRON,Mr. Leaf gets rid of this solitary iron _casse tête_ in a
5163,BRONZE AND IRON,"pleasant way. Since he wrote his _Companion to the Iliad_, 1902, he has"
5164,BRONZE AND IRON,"become converted, as we saw, to the theory, demolished by Mr. Monro,"
5165,BRONZE AND IRON,"Nutzhorn, and Grote, and denounced by Blass, that the origin of our"
5166,BRONZE AND IRON,Homer is a text edited by some literary retainer of Pisistratus of
5167,BRONZE AND IRON,"Athens (about 560-540 B.C.). The editor arranged current lays, ""altered"""
5168,BRONZE AND IRON,"freely, and ""wrote in"" as much as he pleased. Probably he wrote this"
5169,BRONZE AND IRON,"passage in which Nestor describes the man of the iron mace, for ""the"
5170,BRONZE AND IRON,"tales of Nestor's youthful exploits, all of which bear the mark of late"
5171,BRONZE AND IRON,"work, are introduced with no special applicability to the context, but"
5172,BRONZE AND IRON,"rather with the intention of glorifying the ancestor of Pisistratus."""
5173,BRONZE AND IRON,"[Footnote: Iliad (1900), VII. 149, Note.] If Pisistratus was pleased"
5174,BRONZE AND IRON,"with the ancestral portrait, nobody has a right to interfere, but we"
5175,BRONZE AND IRON,need hardly linger over this hypothesis (cf. pp. 281-288).
5176,BRONZE AND IRON,
5177,BRONZE AND IRON,"Iron axes are offered as prizes by Achilles, [Footnote: Iliad,"
5178,BRONZE AND IRON,"XXIII. 850.] and we have the iron axes of Odysseus, who shot an arrow"
5179,BRONZE AND IRON,"through the apertures in the blades, at the close of the Odyssey."
5180,BRONZE AND IRON,"But all these axes, as we shall show, were not weapons, but _peaceful"
5181,BRONZE AND IRON,implements_.
5182,BRONZE AND IRON,
5183,BRONZE AND IRON,As a matter of certain fact the swords and spears of Homer's
5184,BRONZE AND IRON,"warriors are invariably said by the poet to be of bronze, not of iron,"
5185,BRONZE AND IRON,in cases where the metal of the weapons is specified.
5186,BRONZE AND IRON,
5187,BRONZE AND IRON,Except for an arrow-head (to which we shall return) and the one iron
5188,BRONZE AND IRON,"mace, noted as an eccentricity, no weapon in Homer is ever said to be of"
5189,BRONZE AND IRON,iron.
5190,BRONZE AND IRON,
5191,BRONZE AND IRON,The richest men use swords of bronze. Not one chooses to indulge in a
5192,BRONZE AND IRON,"sword said to be of iron. The god, Hephaestus, makes a bronze sword for"
5193,BRONZE AND IRON,"Achilles, whose own bronze sword was lent to Patroclus, and lost by"
5194,BRONZE AND IRON,him to Hector. [Footnote: _Iliad_ XVI. 136; XIX. 372-373.] This bronze
5195,BRONZE AND IRON,"sword, at least, Achilles uses, after receiving the divine armour of the"
5196,BRONZE AND IRON,"god. The sword of Paris is of bronze, as is the sword of Odysseus in the"
5197,BRONZE AND IRON,"Odyssey. [Footnote: _Iliad_, III. 334-335] Bronze is the sword which he"
5198,BRONZE AND IRON,"brought from Troy, and bronze is the sword presented to him by Euryalus"
5199,BRONZE AND IRON,"in Phaeacia, and bronze is the spear with which he fought under the"
5200,BRONZE AND IRON,"walls of Ilios. [Footnote: _Odyssey_, X. 162, 261-262] There are other"
5201,BRONZE AND IRON,"examples of bronze swords, while spears are invariably said to be of"
5202,BRONZE AND IRON,"bronze, when the metal of the spear is specified."
5203,BRONZE AND IRON,
5204,BRONZE AND IRON,Here we are on the ground of solid certainty: we see that the Homeric
5205,BRONZE AND IRON,warrior has regularly spear and sword of bronze. If any man used a spear
5206,BRONZE AND IRON,"or sword of iron, Homer never once mentions the fact. If the poets,"
5207,BRONZE AND IRON,"in an age of iron weapons, always spoke of bronze, out of deference to"
5208,BRONZE AND IRON,"tradition, they must have puzzled their iron-using military patrons."
5209,BRONZE AND IRON,
5210,BRONZE AND IRON,"Thus, as regards weapons, the Homeric heroes are in the age of bronze,"
5211,BRONZE AND IRON,like them who slept in the tombs of the Mycenaean age. When Homer speaks
5212,BRONZE AND IRON,"of the use of cutting instruments of iron, he is always concerned,"
5213,BRONZE AND IRON,"except in the two cases given, not with [blank space] but with"
5214,BRONZE AND IRON,"_implements_, which really were of iron. The wheelwright fells a tree"
5215,BRONZE AND IRON,"""with the iron,"" that is, with an axe; Antilochus fears that Achilles"
5216,BRONZE AND IRON,"""will cut his own throat with the iron,"" that is, with his knife, a"
5217,BRONZE AND IRON,"thing never used in battle; the cattle struggle when slain with ""the"
5218,BRONZE AND IRON,"iron,"" that is, the butcher's knife; and Odysseus shoots ""through"
5219,BRONZE AND IRON,"the iron,"" that is, through the holes in the blade of the iron axes."
5220,BRONZE AND IRON,[Footnote: For this peculiar kind of Mycenaean axe with holes in the
5221,BRONZE AND IRON,"blade, see the design of a bronze example from Vaphio in Tsountas and"
5222,BRONZE AND IRON,"Manatt, _The Mycenaean Age_, p. 207, fig. 94.] Thus Homer never says"
5223,BRONZE AND IRON,"that this or that was done ""with the iron"" in the case of any but one"
5224,BRONZE AND IRON,"weapon of war. Pandarus ""drew the bow-string to his breast and to the"
5225,BRONZE AND IRON,"bow."" [Footnote: Iliad, W. 123.] Whoever wrote that line was writing"
5226,BRONZE AND IRON,"in an age, we may think, when arrow-heads were commonly of iron; but in"
5227,BRONZE AND IRON,"Homer, when the metal of the arrow-head is mentioned, except, in this"
5228,BRONZE AND IRON,"one case, it is always bronze. The iron arrow-tip of Pandarus was of an"
5229,BRONZE AND IRON,"early type, the shaft did not run into the socket of the arrow-head; the"
5230,BRONZE AND IRON,"tang of the arrow-head, on the other hand, entered the shaft, and was"
5231,BRONZE AND IRON,"whipped on with sinew. [_Iliad_, IV. 151.] Pretty primitive this method,"
5232,BRONZE AND IRON,still the iron is an advance on the uniform bronze of Homer. The line
5233,BRONZE AND IRON,"about Pandarus and the iron arrow-head may really be early enough, for"
5234,BRONZE AND IRON,the arrow-head is of a primitive kind--socketless--and primitive is
5235,BRONZE AND IRON,"the attitude of the archer: he ""drew the arrow to his breast."" On the"
5236,BRONZE AND IRON,"Mycenaean silver bowl, representing a siege, the archers draw to the"
5237,BRONZE AND IRON,"breast, in the primitive style, as does the archer on the bronze dagger"
5238,BRONZE AND IRON,with a representation of a lion hunt. The Assyrians and Khita drew
5239,BRONZE AND IRON,"to the ear, as the monuments prove, and so does the ""Cypro-Mycenaean"""
5240,BRONZE AND IRON,"archer of the ivory draught-box from Enkomi. [Footnote: Evans,"
5241,BRONZE AND IRON,"Journal of the Anthropological Institute, vol. xxx. p. 210.] In"
5242,BRONZE AND IRON,these circumstances we cannot deny that the poet may have known iron
5243,BRONZE AND IRON,arrow-heads.
5244,BRONZE AND IRON,
5245,BRONZE AND IRON,We now take the case of axes. We never hear from Homer of the use of
5246,BRONZE AND IRON,"an iron axe in battle, and warlike use of an axe only occurs twice. In"
5247,BRONZE AND IRON,"_Iliad_, XV. 711, in a battle at and on the ships, ""they were fighting"
5248,BRONZE AND IRON,"with sharp axes and battle-axes"" ([Greek text: axinai]) ""and with great"
5249,BRONZE AND IRON,"swords, and spears armed at butt and tip."" At and on the ships, men"
5250,BRONZE AND IRON,would set hand to whatever tool of cutting edge was accessible. Seiler
5251,BRONZE AND IRON,thinks that only the Trojans used the battle-axe; perhaps for damaging
5252,BRONZE AND IRON,"the ships: he follows the scholiast. [Greek text: Axinae], however,"
5253,BRONZE AND IRON,"[Footnote: _Iliad_, XIII. 611.] may perhaps be rendered ""battle-axe,"" as"
5254,BRONZE AND IRON,"a Trojan, Peisandros, fights with an [Greek text: Axinae], and this is"
5255,BRONZE AND IRON,"the only place in the _Iliad_, except XV. 711, where the thing is said"
5256,BRONZE AND IRON,"to be used as a weapon. But it is not an _iron_ axe; it is ""of fine"
5257,BRONZE AND IRON,"bronze."" Only one bronze _battle-axe_, according to Dr. Joseph Anderson,"
5258,BRONZE AND IRON,"is known to have been found in Scotland, though there are many bronze"
5259,BRONZE AND IRON,heads of axes which were tools.
5260,BRONZE AND IRON,
5261,BRONZE AND IRON,"Axes ([Greek text: pelekeis]) were _implements_, tools of the carpenter,"
5262,BRONZE AND IRON,"woodcutter, shipwright, and so on; they were not weapons of war of the"
5263,BRONZE AND IRON,Achaeans.
5264,BRONZE AND IRON,
5265,BRONZE AND IRON,"As implements they are, with very rare exceptions, of iron. The"
5266,BRONZE AND IRON,"wheelwright fells trees ""with the gleaming iron,"" iron being a synonym"
5267,BRONZE AND IRON,"for axe and for knife. [Footnote: _Iliad_, IV. 485] In _Iliad_, XIII."
5268,BRONZE AND IRON,"391, the shipwrights cut timber with axes. In _Iliad_, XXIII. 114,"
5269,BRONZE AND IRON,"woodcutters' axes are employed in tree-felling, but the results are"
5270,BRONZE AND IRON,"said to be produced [Greek text: tanaaekei chalcho], ""by the long-edged"
5271,BRONZE AND IRON,"bronze,"" where the word [Greek text: tanaaekaes] is borrowed from the"
5272,BRONZE AND IRON,"usual epithet of swords; ""the long edge"" is quite inappropriate to a"
5273,BRONZE AND IRON,woodcutter's axe. On Calypso's isle Calypso gives to Odysseus a bronze
5274,BRONZE AND IRON,axe for his raft-making. Butcher's work is done with an axe. [Footnote:
5275,BRONZE AND IRON,"_Iliad_, XVII. 520; Odyssey, III. 442-449.] The axes offered by Achilles"
5276,BRONZE AND IRON,as a prize for archers and the axes through which Odysseus shot are
5277,BRONZE AND IRON,"_implements_ of iron. [Footnote: _Iliad_, XXIII. 850; Odyssey, XXI. 3,"
5278,BRONZE AND IRON,"81, 97.]"
5279,BRONZE AND IRON,
5280,BRONZE AND IRON,"In the Odyssey, when the poet describes the process of tempering iron,"
5281,BRONZE AND IRON,"we read, ""as when a smith dips a great axe or an adze in chill water,"
5282,BRONZE AND IRON,"for thus men temper iron."" [Footnote: Odyssey, IX. 391-393.] He is not"
5283,BRONZE AND IRON,"using iron to make a sword or spear, but a tool-adze or axe. The poet is"
5284,BRONZE AND IRON,perfectly consistent. There are also examples both of bronze axes
5285,BRONZE AND IRON,"and, apparently, of bronze knives. Thus, though the woodcutter's or"
5286,BRONZE AND IRON,"carpenter's axe is of bronze in two passages cited, iron is the usual"
5287,BRONZE AND IRON,"material of the axe or adze. Again we saw, when Achilles gives a mass of"
5288,BRONZE AND IRON,"iron as a prize in the games, he does not mean the armourer to fashion"
5289,BRONZE AND IRON,"it into sword or spear, but says that it will serve the shepherd or"
5290,BRONZE AND IRON,"ploughman for domestic implements, [Footnote: Leaf, _Iliad_ (1902),"
5291,BRONZE AND IRON,"XXIII. line 30, Note.] so that the men need not, on an upland farm, go"
5292,BRONZE AND IRON,to the city for iron implements. In commenting upon this Mr. Leaf is
5293,BRONZE AND IRON,"scarcely at the proper point of view. He says, [Footnote: _Iliad_,"
5294,BRONZE AND IRON,"XXIII. 835, Note.] ""the idea of a state of things when the ploughman and"
5295,BRONZE AND IRON,shepherd forge their own tools from a lump of raw iron has a suspicious
5296,BRONZE AND IRON,appearance of a deliberate attempt to represent from the inner
5297,BRONZE AND IRON,consciousness an archaic state of civilisation. In Homeric times the
5298,BRONZE AND IRON,"[Greek: chalceus] is already specialised as a worker in metals...."""
5299,BRONZE AND IRON,"However, Homer does not say that the ploughman and shepherd ""forge their"
5300,BRONZE AND IRON,"own tools."" A Homeric chief, far from a town, would have his own smithy,"
5301,BRONZE AND IRON,just as the laird of Runraurie (now Urrard) had his smithy at the
5302,BRONZE AND IRON,time of the battle of Killicrankie (1689). Mackay's forces left their
5303,BRONZE AND IRON,"_impedimenta_ ""at the laird's smithy,"" says an eye-witness. [Footnote:"
5304,BRONZE AND IRON,"Napier's _Life_ Of _Dundee_, iii. p. 724.]"
5305,BRONZE AND IRON,
5306,BRONZE AND IRON,The idea of a late Homeric poet trying to reconstruct from his fancy
5307,BRONZE AND IRON,a prehistoric state of civilisation is out of the question. Even
5308,BRONZE AND IRON,historical novelists of the eighteenth century A.D. scarcely attempted
5309,BRONZE AND IRON,such an effort.
5310,BRONZE AND IRON,
5311,BRONZE AND IRON,This was the regular state of things in the Highlands during the
5312,BRONZE AND IRON,"eighteenth century, when many chiefs, and most of the clans, lived far"
5313,BRONZE AND IRON,"from any town. But these rural smiths did not make sword-blades, which"
5314,BRONZE AND IRON,"Prince Charles, as late as 1750, bought on the Continent. The"
5315,BRONZE AND IRON,Andrea Ferrara-marked broadsword blades of the clans were of foreign
5316,BRONZE AND IRON,manufacture. The Highland smiths did such rough iron work as was needed
5317,BRONZE AND IRON,for rural purposes. Perhaps the Homeric chief may have sometimes been
5318,BRONZE AND IRON,"a craftsman like the heroes of the Sagas, great sword-smiths. Odysseus"
5319,BRONZE AND IRON,"himself, notably an excellent carpenter, may have been as good a"
5320,BRONZE AND IRON,"sword-smith, but every hero was not so accomplished."
5321,BRONZE AND IRON,
5322,BRONZE AND IRON,In searching with microscopes for Homeric discrepancies and
5323,BRONZE AND IRON,"interpolations, critics are apt to forget the ways of old rural society."
5324,BRONZE AND IRON,
5325,BRONZE AND IRON,"The Homeric poems, whether composed in one age or throughout five"
5326,BRONZE AND IRON,"centuries, are thus entirely uniform in allotting bronze as the"
5327,BRONZE AND IRON,"material for all sorts of warlike gear, down to the solitary battle-axe"
5328,BRONZE AND IRON,"mentioned; and iron as the usual metal for heavy tools, knives,"
5329,BRONZE AND IRON,"carpenters' axes, adzes, and agricultural implements, with the rare"
5330,BRONZE AND IRON,exceptions which we have cited in the case of bronze knives and axes.
5331,BRONZE AND IRON,Either this distinction--iron for tools and implements; bronze for
5332,BRONZE AND IRON,"armour, swords, and spears--prevailed throughout the period of the"
5333,BRONZE AND IRON,Homeric poets or poet; or the poets invented such a stage of culture; or
5334,BRONZE AND IRON,"poets, some centuries later, deliberately kept bronze for weapons only,"
5335,BRONZE AND IRON,while introducing iron for implements. In that case they were showing
5336,BRONZE AND IRON,archaeological conscientiousness in following the presumed earlier poets
5337,BRONZE AND IRON,"of the bronze age, the age of the Mycenaean graves."
5338,BRONZE AND IRON,
5339,BRONZE AND IRON,Now early poets are never studious archaeologists. Examining the [blank
5340,BRONZE AND IRON,space] certainly based on old lays and legends which survive in
5341,BRONZE AND IRON,"the Edda, we find that the poets of the _Nibelungenlied_ introduce"
5342,BRONZE AND IRON,chivalrous and Christian manners. They do not archaeologise. The poets
5343,BRONZE AND IRON,of the French _Chansons de Geste_ (eleventh to thirteenth centuries)
5344,BRONZE AND IRON,"bring their own weapons, and even armorial bearings, into the 'remote"
5345,BRONZE AND IRON,"age of Charlemagne, which they know from legends and _cantilènes_."
5346,BRONZE AND IRON,"Again, the later _remanieurs_ of the earliest _Chansons de Geste_"
5347,BRONZE AND IRON,"modernise the details of these poems. But, _per impossibile_, and"
5348,BRONZE AND IRON,"for the sake of argument, suppose that the later interpolators and"
5349,BRONZE AND IRON,"continuators of the Homeric lays were antiquarian precisians, or, on"
5350,BRONZE AND IRON,"the other hand, ""deliberately attempted to reproduce from their inner"
5351,BRONZE AND IRON,"consciousness an archaic state of civilisation."" Suppose that, though"
5352,BRONZE AND IRON,"they lived in an age of iron weapons, they knew, as Hesiod knew, that"
5353,BRONZE AND IRON,"the old heroes ""had warlike gear of bronze, and ploughed with bronze,"
5354,BRONZE AND IRON,"and there was no black iron."" [Footnote: Hesiod, _Works and Days_, pp."
5355,BRONZE AND IRON,"250, 251.] In that case, why did the later interpolating poets introduce"
5356,BRONZE AND IRON,"iron as the special material of tools and implements, knives and axes,"
5357,BRONZE AND IRON,"in an age when they knew that there was no iron? Savants such as, by"
5358,BRONZE AND IRON,"this theory, the later poets of the full-blown age of iron were, they"
5359,BRONZE AND IRON,must have known that the knives and axes of the old heroes were made of
5360,BRONZE AND IRON,bronze. In old votive offerings in temples and in any Mycenaean graves
5361,BRONZE AND IRON,"which might be opened, the learned poets of 800-600 B.C. saw with their"
5362,BRONZE AND IRON,"eyes knives and axes of bronze. [Footnote: _Early Age of Greece_, i."
5363,BRONZE AND IRON,"413-416.] The knife of Agamemnon ([Greek: machaira]), which hangs from"
5364,BRONZE AND IRON,"his girdle, beside his sword, [Footnote: _Iliad_, III. 271; XIX. 252.]"
5365,BRONZE AND IRON,corresponds to the knives found in Grave IV. at Mycenae; the handles of
5366,BRONZE AND IRON,"these dirks have a ring for suspension. [Footnote: Tsountas and Manatt,"
5367,BRONZE AND IRON,"p. 204.] But these knives, in Mycenaean graves, are of bronze, and of"
5368,BRONZE AND IRON,bronze are the axes in the Mycenaean deposits and the dagger of Enkomi.
5369,BRONZE AND IRON,"[Footnote: _Ibid._, pp. 145, 207, 208, 256. _Evans, Journal of the"
5370,BRONZE AND IRON,"Anthropological Institute_, vol xxx. p, 214.]"
5371,BRONZE AND IRON,
5372,BRONZE AND IRON,"Why, then, did the late poetic interpolators, who knew that the spears"
5373,BRONZE AND IRON,"and swords of the old warriors were of bronze, and who describe them as"
5374,BRONZE AND IRON,"of bronze, not know that their knives and axes were also of bronze? Why"
5375,BRONZE AND IRON,"did they describe the old knives and axes as of iron, while Hesiod knew,"
5376,BRONZE AND IRON,"and could have told them--did tell them, in fact--that they were of"
5377,BRONZE AND IRON,bronze? Clearly the theory that Homeric poets were archaeological
5378,BRONZE AND IRON,"precisians is impossible. They describe arms as of bronze, tools usually"
5379,BRONZE AND IRON,"as of iron, because they see them to be such in practice."
5380,BRONZE AND IRON,
5381,BRONZE AND IRON,"The poems, in fact, depict a very extraordinary condition of affairs,"
5382,BRONZE AND IRON,such as no poets could invent and adhere to with uniformity. We are
5383,BRONZE AND IRON,accustomed in archaeology to seeing the bronze sword pass by a gradual
5384,BRONZE AND IRON,"transition into the iron sword; but, in Homer, people with abundance of"
5385,BRONZE AND IRON,"iron never, in any one specified case, use iron sword blades or spears."
5386,BRONZE AND IRON,"The greatest chiefs, men said to be rich in gold and iron, always use"
5387,BRONZE AND IRON,swords and spears of _bronze_ in _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_.
5388,BRONZE AND IRON,
5389,BRONZE AND IRON,"The usual process of transition from bronze to iron swords, in a"
5390,BRONZE AND IRON,"prehistoric European age, is traced by Mr. Ridgeway at Hallstatt, ""in"
5391,BRONZE AND IRON,"the heart of the Austrian Alps,"" where a thousand old graves have been"
5392,BRONZE AND IRON,"explored. The swords pass from bronze to iron with bronze hilts, and,"
5393,BRONZE AND IRON,"finally, are wholly of iron. Weapons of bronze are fitted with"
5394,BRONZE AND IRON,iron edges. Axes of iron were much more common than axes of bronze.
5395,BRONZE AND IRON,"[Footnote: _Early Age of Greece_, i. 413-416.] The axes were fashioned"
5396,BRONZE AND IRON,"in the old shapes of the age of bronze, were not of the _bipennis_"
5397,BRONZE AND IRON,"Mycenaean model--the double axe--nor of the shape of the letter D, very"
5398,BRONZE AND IRON,"thick, with two round apertures in the blade, like the bronze axe of"
5399,BRONZE AND IRON,"Vaphio. [Footnote: Monro, Odyssey, vol. ii. 176.] Probably the axes"
5400,BRONZE AND IRON,"through which Odysseus shot an arrow were of this kind, as Mr. Monro,"
5401,BRONZE AND IRON,"and, much earlier, Mr. Butcher and I have argued. [Footnote: _Ibid_."
5402,BRONZE AND IRON,"(1901), vol. ii. Book XIX. line 572. Note. Butcher and Lang, Odyssey,"
5403,BRONZE AND IRON,Appendix (1891).]
5404,BRONZE AND IRON,
5405,BRONZE AND IRON,At Hallstatt there was the _normal_ evolution from bronze swords and
5406,BRONZE AND IRON,"axes to iron swords and axes. Why, then, had Homer's men in his time not"
5407,BRONZE AND IRON,"made this step, seeing that they were familiar with the use of iron? Why"
5408,BRONZE AND IRON,"do they use bronze for swords and spears, iron for tools? The obvious"
5409,BRONZE AND IRON,answer is that they could temper bronze for military purposes much
5410,BRONZE AND IRON,better than they could temper iron. Now Mr. Ridgeway quotes Polybius
5411,BRONZE AND IRON,(ii. 30; ii. 33) for the truly execrable quality of the iron of the
5412,BRONZE AND IRON,Celtic invaders of Italy as late as 225 B.C. Their swords were as bad
5413,BRONZE AND IRON,"as, or worse than, British bayonets; they _always_ ""doubled up."" ""Their"
5414,BRONZE AND IRON,"long iron swords were easily bent, and could only give one downward"
5415,BRONZE AND IRON,stroke with any effect; but after this the edges got so turned and the
5416,BRONZE AND IRON,"blades so bent that, unless they had time to straighten them with"
5417,BRONZE AND IRON,"the foot against the ground, they could not deliver a second blow."""
5418,BRONZE AND IRON,"[Footnote: _Early Age of Greece_, vol. i. 408.] If the heroes in Homer's"
5419,BRONZE AND IRON,"time possessed iron as badly tempered as that of the Celts of 225 B.C.,"
5420,BRONZE AND IRON,"they had every reason to prefer, as they did, excellent bronze for all"
5421,BRONZE AND IRON,"their military weapons, while reserving iron for pacific purposes. A"
5422,BRONZE AND IRON,woodcutter's axe might have any amount of weight and thickness of iron
5423,BRONZE AND IRON,behind the edge; not so a sword blade or a spear point. [Footnote:
5424,BRONZE AND IRON,Monsieur Salomon Reinach suggests to me that the story of Polybius may
5425,BRONZE AND IRON,be a myth. Swords and spear-heads in graves are often found doubled up;
5426,BRONZE AND IRON,"possibly they are thus made dead, like the owner, and their spirits are"
5427,BRONZE AND IRON,thus set free to be of use to his spirit. Finding doubled up iron swords
5428,BRONZE AND IRON,"in Celtic graves, the Romans, M. Beinach suggests, may have explained"
5429,BRONZE AND IRON,"their useless condition by the theory that they doubled up in battle,"
5430,BRONZE AND IRON,"leaving their owners easy victims, and this myth was accepted as fact"
5431,BRONZE AND IRON,"by Polybius. But he was not addicted to myth, nor very remote from the"
5432,BRONZE AND IRON,"events which he chronicles. Again, though bronze grave-weapons in our"
5433,BRONZE AND IRON,"Museum are often doubled up, the myth is not told of the warriors of the"
5434,BRONZE AND IRON,"age of bronze. We later give examples of the doubling up, in battle, of"
5435,BRONZE AND IRON,Scandinavian iron swords as late as 1000 A.D.]
5436,BRONZE AND IRON,
5437,BRONZE AND IRON,In the _Iliad_ we hear of swords breaking at the hilt in dealing a
5438,BRONZE AND IRON,"stroke at shield or helmet, a thing most incident to bronze swords,"
5439,BRONZE AND IRON,"especially of the early type, with a thin bronze tang inserted in a"
5440,BRONZE AND IRON,"hilt of wood, ivory, or amber, or with a slight shelf of the bronze hilt"
5441,BRONZE AND IRON,riveted with three nails on to the bronze blade.
5442,BRONZE AND IRON,
5443,BRONZE AND IRON,"Lycaon struck Peneleos on the socket of his helmet crest, ""and his sword"
5444,BRONZE AND IRON,"brake at the hilt."" [Footnote: _Iliad_, XVI. 339.] The sword of Menelaus"
5445,BRONZE AND IRON,broke into three or four pieces when he smote the helmet ridge of Paris.
5446,BRONZE AND IRON,"[Footnote: _Iliad_, III. 349, 380.] Iron of the Celtic sort described by"
5447,BRONZE AND IRON,"Polybius would have bent, not broken. There is no doubt on that head:"
5448,BRONZE AND IRON,"if Polybius is not romancing, the Celtic sword of 225 B.C. doubled up at"
5449,BRONZE AND IRON,"every stroke, like a piece of hoop iron. But Mr. Leaf tells us that, ""by"
5450,BRONZE AND IRON,"primitive modes of smelting,"" iron is made ""hard and brittle, like cast"
5451,BRONZE AND IRON,"iron."" If so, it would be even less trustworthy for a sword than bronze."
5452,BRONZE AND IRON,"[Footnote: _Iliad_ (1900), Book VI, line 48, Note.] Perhaps the Celts"
5453,BRONZE AND IRON,"of 225 B.C. did not smelt iron by primitive methods, but discovered some"
5454,BRONZE AND IRON,"process for making it not hard and brittle, but flabby."
5455,BRONZE AND IRON,
5456,BRONZE AND IRON,"The swords of the Mycenaean graves, we know, were all of bronze, and,"
5457,BRONZE AND IRON,"in three intaglios on rings from the graves, the point, not the edge, is"
5458,BRONZE AND IRON,"used, [Footnote: Tsountas and Manatt, p. 199.] once against a lion, once"
5459,BRONZE AND IRON,"over the rim of a shield which covers the whole body of an enemy, and"
5460,BRONZE AND IRON,once at too close quarters to permit the use of the edge. It does not
5461,BRONZE AND IRON,follow from these three cases (as critics argue) that no bronze sword
5462,BRONZE AND IRON,"could be used for a swashing blow, and there are just half as many"
5463,BRONZE AND IRON,thrusts as strokes with the bronze sword in the _Iliad_. [Footnote:
5464,BRONZE AND IRON,"Twenty-four cuts to eleven lunges, in the _Iliad_.] As the poet"
5465,BRONZE AND IRON,"constantly dwells on the ""long edge"" of the _bronze_ swords and makes"
5466,BRONZE AND IRON,"heroes use both point and edge, how can we argue that Homeric swords"
5467,BRONZE AND IRON,were of iron and ill fitted to give point? The Highlanders at Clifton
5468,BRONZE AND IRON,"(1746) were obliged, contrary to their common practice, to use the point"
5469,BRONZE AND IRON,"against Cumberland's dragoons. They, like the Achaeans, had heavy cut"
5470,BRONZE AND IRON,"and thrust swords, but theirs were of steel."
5471,BRONZE AND IRON,
5472,BRONZE AND IRON,"If the Achaeans had thoroughly excellent bronze, and had iron as bad as"
5473,BRONZE AND IRON,"that of the Celts a thousand years later, their preference for bronze"
5474,BRONZE AND IRON,over iron for weapons is explained. In Homer the fighters do not very
5475,BRONZE AND IRON,"often come to sword strokes; they fight mainly with the spear, except"
5476,BRONZE AND IRON,"in pursuit, now and then. But when they do strike, they cleave heads and"
5477,BRONZE AND IRON,"cut off arms. They could not do this with bronze rapiers, such as those"
5478,BRONZE AND IRON,with which men give point over the rim of the shield on two Mycenaean
5479,BRONZE AND IRON,"gems. But Mr. Myres writes, ""From the shaft graves (of Mycenae) onwards"
5480,BRONZE AND IRON,there are two types of swords in the Mycenaean world--one an exaggerated
5481,BRONZE AND IRON,"dagger riveted into the front end of the hilt, the other with a flat"
5482,BRONZE AND IRON,"flanged tang running the whole length of the hilt, and covered on either"
5483,BRONZE AND IRON,"face by ornamental grip plates riveted on. This sword, though still of"
5484,BRONZE AND IRON,"bronze, can deal a very effective cut; and, as the Mycenaeans had no"
5485,BRONZE AND IRON,"armour for body or head,"" (?) ""the danger of breaking or bending the"
5486,BRONZE AND IRON,"sword on a cuirass or helmet did not arise."" [Footnote: _Classical"
5487,BRONZE AND IRON,"Review_, xvi. 72.] The danger did exist in Homer's time, as we have"
5488,BRONZE AND IRON,"seen. But a bronze sword, published by Tsountas and Manatt (_Mycenaean"
5489,BRONZE AND IRON,"Age_, p. 199, fig. 88), is emphatically meant to give both point and"
5490,BRONZE AND IRON,"edge, having a solid handle--a continuation of the blade--and a very"
5491,BRONZE AND IRON,"broad blade, coming to a very fine point. Even in Grave V. at Mycenae,"
5492,BRONZE AND IRON,we have a sword blade so massive at the top that it was certainly
5493,BRONZE AND IRON,"capable of a swashing blow. [Footnote: Schuchardt, _Schliemann's"
5494,BRONZE AND IRON,"Excavations_, p. _265, fig._ 269.] The sword of the charioteer on the"
5495,BRONZE AND IRON,_stêlê_ of Grave V. is equally good for cut and thrust. A pleasanter cut
5496,BRONZE AND IRON,and thrust bronze sword than the one found at Ialysus no gentleman could
5497,BRONZE AND IRON,"wish to handle. [Footnote: Furtwängler und Loeschke, _Myk. Va._ Taf."
5498,BRONZE AND IRON,"D.] Homer, in any case, says that his heroes used bronze swords, well"
5499,BRONZE AND IRON,"adapted to strike. If his age had really good bronze, and iron as bad as"
5500,BRONZE AND IRON,"that of the Celts of Polybius, a thousand years later, their preference"
5501,BRONZE AND IRON,of bronze over iron for weapons needs no explanation. If their iron
5502,BRONZE AND IRON,"was not so bad as that of the Celts, their military conservatism might"
5503,BRONZE AND IRON,"retain bronze for weapons, while in civil life they often used iron for"
5504,BRONZE AND IRON,implements.
5505,BRONZE AND IRON,
5506,BRONZE AND IRON,The uniform evidence of the Homeric poems can only be explained on the
5507,BRONZE AND IRON,"supposition that men had plenty of iron; but, while they used it for"
5508,BRONZE AND IRON,"implements, did not yet, with a natural conservatism, trust life and"
5509,BRONZE AND IRON,"victory to iron spears and swords. Unluckily, we cannot test the"
5510,BRONZE AND IRON,"temper of the earliest known iron swords found in Greece, for rust hath"
5511,BRONZE AND IRON,"consumed them, and I know not that the temper of the Mycenaean bronze"
5512,BRONZE AND IRON,swords has been tested against helmets of bronze. I can thus give no
5513,BRONZE AND IRON,evidence from experiment.
5514,BRONZE AND IRON,
5515,BRONZE AND IRON,There is just one line in Homer which disregards the distinction--iron
5516,BRONZE AND IRON,"for implements, bronze for weapons; it is in _Odyssey_, XVI. 294; XIX."
5517,BRONZE AND IRON,13. Telemachus is told to remove the warlike harness of Odysseus from
5518,BRONZE AND IRON,"the hall, lest the wooers use it in the coming fray. He is to explain"
5519,BRONZE AND IRON,"the removal by saying that it has been done, ""Lest you fall to strife in"
5520,BRONZE AND IRON,"your cups, and harm each other, and shame the feast, and _this_ wooing;"
5521,BRONZE AND IRON,"_for iron of himself draweth a man to him_."" The proverb is manifestly"
5522,BRONZE AND IRON,"of an age when iron was almost universally used for weapons, and thus"
5523,BRONZE AND IRON,"was, as in Thucydides, synonymous with all warlike gear; but throughout"
5524,BRONZE AND IRON,the poems no single article of warlike gear is of iron except one
5525,BRONZE AND IRON,eccentric mace and one arrow-head of primitive type. The line in the
5526,BRONZE AND IRON,Odyssey must therefore be a very late addition; it may be removed
5527,BRONZE AND IRON,without injuring the sense of the passage in which it occurs. [Footnote:
5528,BRONZE AND IRON,"This fact, in itself, is of course no proof of interpolation. _Cf._"
5529,BRONZE AND IRON,"Helbig, _op_. cit., p. 331. He thinks the line very late.] If, on the"
5530,BRONZE AND IRON,"other hand, the line be as old as the oldest parts of the poem, the"
5531,BRONZE AND IRON,author for once forgets his usual antiquarian precision.
5532,BRONZE AND IRON,
5533,BRONZE AND IRON,We are thus led to the conclusion that either there was in early Greece
5534,BRONZE AND IRON,an age when weapons were all of bronze while implements were often
5535,BRONZE AND IRON,"of iron, or that the poet, or crowd of poets, invented that state of"
5536,BRONZE AND IRON,things. Now early poets never invent in this way; singing to an audience
5537,BRONZE AND IRON,"of warriors, critical on such a point, they speak of what the warriors"
5538,BRONZE AND IRON,"know to be actual, except when, in a recognised form of decorative"

5543,BRONZE AND IRON,
5544,BRONZE AND IRON,"Our theory is, then, that in the age when the Homeric poems were"
5545,BRONZE AND IRON,"composed, iron, though well known, was on its probation. Men of the"
5546,BRONZE AND IRON,"sword preferred bronze for all their military purposes, just as"
5547,BRONZE AND IRON,fifteenth-century soldiers found the long-bow and cross-bow much more
5548,BRONZE AND IRON,"effective than guns, or as the Duke of Wellington forbade the arming of"
5549,BRONZE AND IRON,all our men with rifles in place of muskets ... for reasons not devoid
5550,BRONZE AND IRON,of plausibility.
5551,BRONZE AND IRON,
5552,BRONZE AND IRON,"Sir John Evans supposes that, in the seventh century, the Carian and"
5553,BRONZE AND IRON,"Ionian invaders of Egypt were still using offensive arms of bronze, not"
5554,BRONZE AND IRON,"of iron. [Footnote: Ancient _Bronze Implements_, p. 8 (1881), citing"
5555,BRONZE AND IRON,"Herodotus, ii. c. 112. Sir John is not sure that Achaean spear-heads"
5556,BRONZE AND IRON,"were not of copper, for they twice double up against a shield. _Iliad_,"
5557,BRONZE AND IRON,"III. 348; VII. 259; Evans, p. 13.] Sir John remarks that ""for a"
5558,BRONZE AND IRON,"considerable time after the Homeric period, bronze remained in use for"
5559,BRONZE AND IRON,"offensive weapons,"" especially for ""spears, lances, and arrows."""
5560,BRONZE AND IRON,"Hesiod, quite unlike his contemporaries, the ""later"" poets of Iliad"
5561,BRONZE AND IRON,"and _Odyssey_, gives to Heracles an iron helmet and sword. [Footnote:"
5562,BRONZE AND IRON,"_Scutum Herculis_, pp. 122-138.] Hesiod knew better, but was not a"
5563,BRONZE AND IRON,consistent archaiser. Sir John thinks that as early as 500 or even 600
5564,BRONZE AND IRON,"B.C. iron and steel were in common use for weapons in Greece, but"
5565,BRONZE AND IRON,not yet had they altogether superseded bronze battle-axes and spears.
5566,BRONZE AND IRON,"[Footnote: Evans, p. 18.] By Sir John's showing, iron for offensive"
5567,BRONZE AND IRON,"weapons superseded bronze very slowly indeed in Greece; and, if my"
5568,BRONZE AND IRON,"argument be correct, it had not done so when the Homeric poems were"
5569,BRONZE AND IRON,"composed. Iron merely served for utensils, and the poems reflect that"
5570,BRONZE AND IRON,stage of transition which no poet could dream of inventing.
5571,BRONZE AND IRON,
5572,BRONZE AND IRON,These pages had been written before my attention was directed to M.
5573,BRONZE AND IRON,"Bérard's book, _Les Pheniciens et l'Odyssée_ (Paris, 1902). M. Bérard"
5574,BRONZE AND IRON,"has anticipated and rather outrun my ideas. ""I might almost say,"" he"
5575,BRONZE AND IRON,"remarks, ""that iron is the popular metal, native and rustic... the"
5576,BRONZE AND IRON,shepherd and ploughman can extract and work it without going to the
5577,BRONZE AND IRON,"town."" The chief's smith could work iron, if he had iron to work, and"
5578,BRONZE AND IRON,"this iron Achilles gave as a prize. ""With rustic methods of working it"
5579,BRONZE AND IRON,"iron is always impure; it has 'straws' in it, and is brittle. It may be"
5580,BRONZE AND IRON,the metal for peace and for implements. In our fields we see the reaper
5581,BRONZE AND IRON,"sit down and repair his sickle. In war is needed a metal less hard,"
5582,BRONZE AND IRON,"perhaps, but more tough and not so easily broken. You cannot sit down"
5583,BRONZE AND IRON,"in the field of battle, as in a field of barley, to beat your sword"
5584,BRONZE AND IRON,"straight...."" [Footnote: Bérard, i. 435.]"
5585,BRONZE AND IRON,
5586,BRONZE AND IRON,"So the Celts found, if we believe Polybius."
5587,BRONZE AND IRON,
5588,BRONZE AND IRON,"On the other hand, iron swords did supersede bronze swords in the long"
5589,BRONZE AND IRON,"run. Apparently they had not done so in the age of the poet, but iron"
5590,BRONZE AND IRON,"had certainly ceased to be ""a precious metal""; knives and woodcutters'"
5591,BRONZE AND IRON,"axes are never made of a metal that is precious and rare. I am thus led,"
5592,BRONZE AND IRON,"on a general view, to suppose that the poems took shape when iron was"
5593,BRONZE AND IRON,"very well known, but was not yet, as in the ""Dipylon"" period in Crete,"
5594,BRONZE AND IRON,commonly used by sword-smiths.
5595,BRONZE AND IRON,
5596,BRONZE AND IRON,The ideas here stated are not unlike those of Paul Cauer. [Footnote:
5597,BRONZE AND IRON,"_Grundfrager des Homerkritik,_ pp. 183-187. Leipsic, 1895.] I do not,"
5598,BRONZE AND IRON,"however, find the mentions of iron useful as a test of ""early"" and"
5599,BRONZE AND IRON,"""late"" lays, which it is his theory that they are. Thus he says:--"
5600,BRONZE AND IRON,
5601,BRONZE AND IRON,"(1) Iron is often mentioned as part of a man's personal property, while"
5602,BRONZE AND IRON,"we are not told how he means to use it. It is named with bronze, gold,"
5603,BRONZE AND IRON,and girls. The poet has no definite picture before his eyes; he is vague
5604,BRONZE AND IRON,"about iron. But, we reply, his picture of iron in these passages is"
5605,BRONZE AND IRON,neither more nor less definite than his mental picture of the other
5606,BRONZE AND IRON,"commodities. He calls iron ""hard to smithy,"" ""grey,"" ""dark-hued""; he"
5607,BRONZE AND IRON,"knows, in fact, all about it. He does not tell us what the owner is"
5608,BRONZE AND IRON,"going to do with the gold and the bronze and the girls, any more than he"
5609,BRONZE AND IRON,tells us what is to be done with the iron. Such information was rather
5610,BRONZE AND IRON,in the nature of a luxury than a necessity. Every hearer knew the uses
5611,BRONZE AND IRON,of all four commodities. This does not seem to have occurred to Cauer.
5612,BRONZE AND IRON,
5613,BRONZE AND IRON,"(2) Iron is spoken of as an emblem of hard things, as, to take a modern"
5614,BRONZE AND IRON,"example, in Mr. Swinburne's ""armed and iron maidenhood ""--said of"
5615,BRONZE AND IRON,"Atalanta. Hearts are ""iron,"" strength is ""iron,"" flesh is not ""iron,"" an"
5616,BRONZE AND IRON,"""iron"" noise goes up to the heaven of bronze. It may not follow, Cauer"
5617,BRONZE AND IRON,"thinks, from these phrases that iron was used in any way. Men are"
5618,BRONZE AND IRON,"supposed to marvel at its strange properties; it was ""new and rare."" I"
5619,BRONZE AND IRON,see no ground for this inference.
5620,BRONZE AND IRON,
5621,BRONZE AND IRON,"(3) We have the ""iron gates"" of Tartarus, and the ""iron bonds"" in which"
5622,BRONZE AND IRON,Odysseus was possibly lying; it does not follow that chains or gates
5623,BRONZE AND IRON,were made of iron any more than that gates were of chrysoprase in the
5624,BRONZE AND IRON,days of St. John.
5625,BRONZE AND IRON,
5626,BRONZE AND IRON,"(4) Next, we have mention of implements, not weapons, of iron--a"
5627,BRONZE AND IRON,remarkable trait of culture. Greek ploughs and axes were made of iron
5628,BRONZE AND IRON,before spears and swords were of iron.
5629,BRONZE AND IRON,
5630,BRONZE AND IRON,"(5) We have mention of iron weapons, namely, the unique iron mace of"
5631,BRONZE AND IRON,"Areithous and the solitary iron arrow-head of Pandarus, and what Cauer"
5632,BRONZE AND IRON,calls the iron swords (more probably knives) of Achilles and others. It
5633,BRONZE AND IRON,"is objected to the ""iron"" of Achilles that Antilochus fears he will cut"
5634,BRONZE AND IRON,"his throat with it on hearing of the death of Patroclus, while there"
5635,BRONZE AND IRON,is no other mention of suicide in the _Iliad_. It does not follow that
5636,BRONZE AND IRON,"suicide was unheard of; indeed, Achilles may be thinking of suicide"
5637,BRONZE AND IRON,"presently, in XIII. 98, when he says to his mother: ""Let me die at once,"
5638,BRONZE AND IRON,"since it was not my lot to succour my comrade."""
5639,BRONZE AND IRON,
5640,BRONZE AND IRON,(6) We have the iron-making spoken of in Book IX. 393 of the _Odyssey_.
5641,BRONZE AND IRON,
5642,BRONZE AND IRON,It does not appear to us that the use of iron as an epithet bespeaks
5643,BRONZE AND IRON,"an age when iron was a mysterious thing, known mainly by reputation,"
5644,BRONZE AND IRON,"""a costly possession."" The epithets ""iron strength,"" and so on, may as"
5645,BRONZE AND IRON,readily be used in our own age or any other. If iron were at first a
5646,BRONZE AND IRON,"""precious"" metal, it is odd that Homeric men first used it, as Cauer"
5647,BRONZE AND IRON,"sees that they did, to make points to ploughshares and ""tools of"
5648,BRONZE AND IRON,"agriculture and handiwork."" ""Then people took to working iron for"
5649,BRONZE AND IRON,"weapons."" Just so, but we cannot divide the _Iliad_ into earlier and"
5650,BRONZE AND IRON,later portions in proportion to the various mentions of iron in various
5651,BRONZE AND IRON,Books. These statistics are of no value for separatist purposes. It is
5652,BRONZE AND IRON,"impossible to believe that men when they spoke of ""iron strength,"" ""iron"
5653,BRONZE AND IRON,"hearts,"" ""grey iron,"" ""iron hard to smithy,"" did so because iron was,"
5654,BRONZE AND IRON,"first, an almost unknown legendary mineral, next, ""a precious metal,"""
5655,BRONZE AND IRON,"then the metal of drudgery, and finally the metal of weapons."
5656,BRONZE AND IRON,
5657,BRONZE AND IRON,"The real point of interest is, as Cauer sees, that domestic preceded"
5658,BRONZE AND IRON,"military uses of iron among the Achaeans. He seems, however, to think"
5659,BRONZE AND IRON,that the confinement of the use of bronze to weapons is a matter of
5660,BRONZE AND IRON,"traditional style. [Footnote: ""Nur die Sprache der Dichter hielt an dem"
5661,BRONZE AND IRON,"Gebrauch der Bronze fest, die in den Jahrhunderten, während deren der"
5662,BRONZE AND IRON,"Epische Stil erwachsen war, allein geherrscht hatte.""] But, in the early"
5663,BRONZE AND IRON,"days of the waxing epics, tools as well as weapons were, as in Homer"
5664,BRONZE AND IRON,"they occasionally are, of bronze. Why, then, do the supposed late"
5665,BRONZE AND IRON,"continuators represent tools, not weapons, as of iron? Why do they not"
5666,BRONZE AND IRON,"cleave to the traditional term--bronze--in the case of tools, as the"
5667,BRONZE AND IRON,same men do in the case of weapons?
5668,BRONZE AND IRON,
5669,BRONZE AND IRON,Helbig offers an apparently untenable explanation of this fact. He has
5670,BRONZE AND IRON,proposed an interpretation of the uses of bronze and iron in the poems
5671,BRONZE AND IRON,entirely different from that which I offer. [Footnote: _Sur la Question
5672,BRONZE AND IRON,"Mycénienne_. 1896.] Unfortunately, one can scarcely criticise his theory"
5673,BRONZE AND IRON,without entering again into the whole question of the construction
5674,BRONZE AND IRON,"of the Epics. He thinks that the origin of the poems dates from ""the"
5675,BRONZE AND IRON,"Mycenaean period,"" and that the later continuators of the poems retained"
5676,BRONZE AND IRON,the traditions of that remote age. Thus they thrice call Mycenae
5677,BRONZE AND IRON,"""golden,"" though, in the changed economic conditions of their own"
5678,BRONZE AND IRON,"period, Mycenae could no longer be ""golden""; and I presume that, if"
5679,BRONZE AND IRON,"possible, the city would have issued a papyrus currency without a"
5680,BRONZE AND IRON,"metallic basis. However this may be, ""in the description of customs"
5681,BRONZE AND IRON,"the epic poets did their best to avoid everything modern."" Here we"
5682,BRONZE AND IRON,have again that unprecedented phenomenon--early poets who are
5683,BRONZE AND IRON,archaeologically precise.
5684,BRONZE AND IRON,
5685,BRONZE AND IRON,We have first to suppose that the kernel of the _Iliad_ originated in
5686,BRONZE AND IRON,"the Mycenaean age, the age of bronze. We are next to believe that this"
5687,BRONZE AND IRON,"kernel was expanded into the actual Epic in later and changed times,"
5688,BRONZE AND IRON,but that the later poets adhered in their descriptions to the Mycenaean
5689,BRONZE AND IRON,"standard, avoiding ""everything modern."" That poets of an uncritical"
5690,BRONZE AND IRON,"period, when treating of the themes of ancient legend or song, carefully"
5691,BRONZE AND IRON,avoid everything modern is an opinion not warranted by the usage of
5692,BRONZE AND IRON,"the authors of the _Chansons de Geste_, of _Beowulf_, and of the"
5693,BRONZE AND IRON,"_Nibelungenlied_. These poets, we must repeat, invariably introduce"
5694,BRONZE AND IRON,"in their chants concerning ancient days the customs, costume, armour,"
5695,BRONZE AND IRON,"religion, and weapons of their own time. Dr. Helbig supposes that the"
5696,BRONZE AND IRON,"late Greek poets, however, who added to the _Iliad_, carefully avoided"
5697,BRONZE AND IRON,doing what other poets of uncritical ages have always done. [Footnote:
5698,BRONZE AND IRON,"_La Question Mycénienne_, p. 50.]"
5699,BRONZE AND IRON,
5700,BRONZE AND IRON,"This is his position in his text (p. 50). In his note 1 to page 50,"
5701,BRONZE AND IRON,"however, he occupies the precisely contrary position. ""The epic poems"
5702,BRONZE AND IRON,"were chanted, as a rule, in the houses of more or less warlike chiefs."
5703,BRONZE AND IRON,"It is, then, _à priori_ probable that the later poets took into account"
5704,BRONZE AND IRON,the _contemporary_ military state of things. Their audience would have
5705,BRONZE AND IRON,been much perturbed (_bien chequés_) if they had heard the poet mention
5706,BRONZE AND IRON,nothing but arms and forms of attack and defence to which they were
5707,BRONZE AND IRON,"unaccustomed."" If so, when iron weapons came in the poets would"
5708,BRONZE AND IRON,"substitute iron for bronze, in lays new and old, but they never do."
5709,BRONZE AND IRON,"However, this is Helbig's opinion in his note. But in his text he says"
5710,BRONZE AND IRON,"that the poets, carefully avoiding the contemporary, ""the modern,"" make"
5711,BRONZE AND IRON,"the heroes fight, not on horseback, but from chariots. Their listeners,"
5712,BRONZE AND IRON,"according to his note, must have been _bien chequés_, for there came a"
5713,BRONZE AND IRON,time when _they_ were not accustomed to war chariots.
5714,BRONZE AND IRON,
5715,BRONZE AND IRON,"Thus the poets who, in Dr. Helbig's text, ""avoid as far as possible all"
5716,BRONZE AND IRON,"that is modern,"" in his note, on the same page, ""take account of the"
5717,BRONZE AND IRON,"contemporary state of things,"" and are as modern as possible where"
5718,BRONZE AND IRON,weapons _are_ concerned. Their audience would be sadly put out (_bien
5719,BRONZE AND IRON,"chequés_) ""if they heard talk only of arms ... to which they were"
5720,BRONZE AND IRON,"unaccustomed""; talk of large suspended shields, of uncorsleted heroes,"
5721,BRONZE AND IRON,"and of bronze weapons. They had to endure it, whether they liked it or"
5722,BRONZE AND IRON,"not, _teste_ Reichel. Dr. Helbig seems to speak correctly in his note;"
5723,BRONZE AND IRON,in his text his contradictory opinion appears to be wrong. Experience
5724,BRONZE AND IRON,"teaches us that the poets of an uncritical age--Shakespeare, for"
5725,BRONZE AND IRON,example--introduce the weapons of their own period into works dealing
5726,BRONZE AND IRON,with remote ages. Hamlet uses the Elizabethan rapier.
5727,BRONZE AND IRON,
5728,BRONZE AND IRON,"In his argument on bronze and iron, unluckily, Dr. Helbig deserts the"
5729,BRONZE AND IRON,judicious opinions of his note for the opposite theory of his text.
5730,BRONZE AND IRON,"His late poets, in the age of iron, always say that the weapons of the"
5731,BRONZE AND IRON,"heroes are made of bronze. [Footnote: _Op. laud_., p. 51.] They thus,"
5732,BRONZE AND IRON,"""as far as possible avoid what is modern."" But, of course, warriors"
5733,BRONZE AND IRON,"of the age of iron, when they heard the poet talk only of weapons of"
5734,BRONZE AND IRON,"bronze, ""_aurient été bien choqués_"" (as Dr. Helbig truly says in his"
5735,BRONZE AND IRON,"note), on hearing of nothing but ""_armes auxquels ils n'étaient pas"
5736,BRONZE AND IRON,"habitués,_""--arms always of bronze."
5737,BRONZE AND IRON,
5738,BRONZE AND IRON,"Though Dr. Helbig in his text is of the opposite opinion, I must agree"
5739,BRONZE AND IRON,entirely with the view which he states so clearly in his note. It
5740,BRONZE AND IRON,"follows that if a poet speaks invariably of weapons of bronze, he is"
5741,BRONZE AND IRON,living in an age when weapons are made of no other material. In his
5742,BRONZE AND IRON,"text, however, Dr. Helbig maintains that the poets of later ages ""as far"
5743,BRONZE AND IRON,"as possible avoid everything modern,"" and, therefore, mention none but"
5744,BRONZE AND IRON,"bronze weapons. But, as he has pointed out, they do mention iron tools"
5745,BRONZE AND IRON,"and implements. Why do they desert the traditional bronze? Because ""it"
5746,BRONZE AND IRON,"occasionally happened that a poet, when thinking of an entirely new"
5747,BRONZE AND IRON,"subject, wholly emancipated himself from traditional forms,"" [Footnote:"
5748,BRONZE AND IRON,"_Op. laud_., pp. 51, 52]"
5749,BRONZE AND IRON,
5750,BRONZE AND IRON,The examples given in proof are the offer by Achilles of a lump of iron
5751,BRONZE AND IRON,"as the prize for archery--the iron, as we saw, being destined for the"
5752,BRONZE AND IRON,"manufacture of pastoral and agricultural implements, in which Dr. Helbig"
5753,BRONZE AND IRON,"includes the lances of shepherds and ploughmen, though the poet never"
5754,BRONZE AND IRON,"says that they were of iron. [Footnote: _Iliad_, XXIII. 826, 835;"
5755,BRONZE AND IRON,"Odyssey, XIV. 531; XIII. 225.] There are also the axes through which"
5756,BRONZE AND IRON,"Odysseus shoots his arrow. [Footnote: _Odyssey_, XIX. 587; XXI. 3, X,"
5757,BRONZE AND IRON,"97, 114, 127, 138; XXIV. 168, 177; cf. XXI. 61.] ""The poet here treated"
5758,BRONZE AND IRON,"an entirely new subject, in the development of which he had perfect"
5759,BRONZE AND IRON,"liberty."" So he speaks freely of iron. ""But,"" we exclaim, ""tools and"
5760,BRONZE AND IRON,"implements, axes and knives, are not a perfectly new subject!"" They were"
5761,BRONZE AND IRON,"extremely familiar to the age of bronze, the Mycenaean age. Examples of"
5762,BRONZE AND IRON,"bronze tools, arrow-heads, and implements are discovered in excavations"
5763,BRONZE AND IRON,on Mycenaean sites. There was nothing new about bronze tools and
5764,BRONZE AND IRON,"implements. Men had bronze tips to their ploughshares, bronze knives,"
5765,BRONZE AND IRON,"bronze axes, bronze arrow-heads before they used iron."
5766,BRONZE AND IRON,
5767,BRONZE AND IRON,"Perhaps we are to understand that feats of archery, non-military"
5768,BRONZE AND IRON,"contests in bowmanship, are _un sujet à fait nouveau_: a theme so very"
5769,BRONZE AND IRON,"modern that a poet, in singing of it, could let himself go, and dare to"
5770,BRONZE AND IRON,speak of iron implements. But where was the novelty? All peoples who use
5771,BRONZE AND IRON,"the bow in war practise archery in time of peace. The poet, moreover,"
5772,BRONZE AND IRON,"speaks of bronze tools, axes and knives, in other parts of the _Iliad_;"
5773,BRONZE AND IRON,neither tools nor bronze tools constitute _un sujet tout à fait
5774,BRONZE AND IRON,nouveau_. There was nothing new in shooting with a bow and nothing new
5775,BRONZE AND IRON,in the existence of axes. Bows and axes were as familiar to the age
5776,BRONZE AND IRON,of stone and to the age of bronze as to the age of iron. Dr. Helbig's
5777,BRONZE AND IRON,"explanation, therefore, explains nothing, and, unless a better"
5778,BRONZE AND IRON,"explanation is offered, we return to the theory, rejected by Dr. Helbig,"
5779,BRONZE AND IRON,"that implements and tools were often, not always, of iron, while weapons"
5780,BRONZE AND IRON,were of bronze in the age of the poet. Dr. Helbig rejects this opinion.
5781,BRONZE AND IRON,"He writes: ""We cannot in any way admit that, at a period when the socks"
5782,BRONZE AND IRON,"of the plough, the lance points of shepherds"" (which the poet never"
5783,BRONZE AND IRON,"describes as of iron), ""and axe-heads were of iron, warriors still used"
5784,BRONZE AND IRON,"weapons of bronze."" [Footnote: op. _laud._, p. 53.] But it is logically"
5785,BRONZE AND IRON,"possible to admit that this was the real state of affairs, while it is"
5786,BRONZE AND IRON,"logically impossible to admit that bows and tools were ""new subjects"";"
5787,BRONZE AND IRON,"and that late poets, when they sang of military gear, ""_tenaient"
5788,BRONZE AND IRON,"compte de l'armement contemporain,_"" carefully avoiding the peril of"
5789,BRONZE AND IRON,"bewildering their hearers by speaking of antiquated arms, and, at the"
5790,BRONZE AND IRON,"same time, spoke of nothing but antiquated arms--weapons of bronze--and"
5791,BRONZE AND IRON,"of war chariots, to fighting men who did not use war chariots and did"
5792,BRONZE AND IRON,use weapons of iron.
5793,BRONZE AND IRON,
5794,BRONZE AND IRON,These logical contradictions beset all arguments in which it is
5795,BRONZE AND IRON,"maintained that ""the late poets"" are anxious archaisers, and at the same"
5796,BRONZE AND IRON,time are eagerly introducing the armour and equipment of their own age.
5797,BRONZE AND IRON,The critics are in the same quandary as to iron and bronze as traps them
5798,BRONZE AND IRON,"in the case of large shields, small bucklers, greaves, and corslets."
5799,BRONZE AND IRON,"They are obliged to assign contradictory attitudes to their ""late"
5800,BRONZE AND IRON,"poets."" It does not seem possible to admit that a poet, who often"
5801,BRONZE AND IRON,"describes axes as of iron in various passages, does so in his account of"
5802,BRONZE AND IRON,"a peaceful contest in bowmanship, because contests in bowmanship are _UN"
5803,BRONZE AND IRON,sujet TOUT à FAIT NOUVEAU;_ and so he feels at liberty to describe axes
5804,BRONZE AND IRON,"as of iron, while he adheres to bronze as the metal for weapons. He, or"
5805,BRONZE AND IRON,"one of the Odyssean poets, had already asserted (Odyssey, IX. 391) that"
5806,BRONZE AND IRON,iron _was_ the metal for adzes and axes.
5807,BRONZE AND IRON,
5808,BRONZE AND IRON,"Dr. Helbig's argument [Footnote: _La Question Mycénienne_, p. 54.] does"
5809,BRONZE AND IRON,not explain the facts. The bow of Eurytus and the uses to which Odysseus
5810,BRONZE AND IRON,is to put it have been in the poet's mind all through the conduct of his
5811,BRONZE AND IRON,"plot, and there is nothing to suggest that the exploit of bowmanship is"
5812,BRONZE AND IRON,"a very new lay, tacked on to the Odyssey."

5825,BRONZE AND IRON,"_Early Age of Greece_, vol. i. p. 301.] As no spear or sword of iron is"
5826,BRONZE AND IRON,"ever mentioned in the _Iliad_ or Odyssey, as both weapons are always"
5827,BRONZE AND IRON,"of bronze when the metal is specified, I have not ""seen"" that they are"
5828,BRONZE AND IRON,"""regularly,"" or ever, of iron. In proof, Mr. Ridgeway cites the axes"
5829,BRONZE AND IRON,"and knives already mentioned--which are not spears or swords, and are"
5830,BRONZE AND IRON,"sometimes of bronze. He also quotes the line in the Odyssey, ""Iron of"
5831,BRONZE AND IRON,"itself doth attract a man."" But if this line is genuine and original,"
5832,BRONZE AND IRON,"it does not apply to the state of things in the _Iliad_, while it"
5833,BRONZE AND IRON,"contradicts the whole Odyssey, in which swords and spears are _ALWAYS_"
5834,BRONZE AND IRON,of bronze when their metal is mentioned. If the line reveals the true
5835,BRONZE AND IRON,"state of things, then throughout the Odyssey, if not throughout the"
5836,BRONZE AND IRON,"_Iliad_, the poets when they invariably speak of bronze swords and"
5837,BRONZE AND IRON,"spears invariably say what they do not mean. If they do this, how are"
5838,BRONZE AND IRON,"we to know when they mean what they say, and of what value can their"
5839,BRONZE AND IRON,evidence on points of culture be reckoned? They may always be retaining
5840,BRONZE AND IRON,traditional terms as to usages and customs in an age when these are
5841,BRONZE AND IRON,obsolete.
5842,BRONZE AND IRON,
5843,BRONZE AND IRON,"If the Achaeans were, as in Mr. Ridgeway's theory, a northern"
5844,BRONZE AND IRON,"people--""Celts""--who conquered with iron weapons a Pelasgian"
5845,BRONZE AND IRON,"bronze-using Mycenaean people, it is not credible to me that Achaean or"
5846,BRONZE AND IRON,Pelasgian poets habitually used the traditional Pelasgian term for the
5847,BRONZE AND IRON,"metal of weapons, namely, bronze, in songs chanted before victors who"
5848,BRONZE AND IRON,had won their triumph with iron. The traditional phrase of a conquered
5849,BRONZE AND IRON,bronze-using race could not thus survive and flourish in the poetry of
5850,BRONZE AND IRON,an outlandish iron-using race of conquerors.
5851,BRONZE AND IRON,
5852,BRONZE AND IRON,"Mr. Ridgeway cites the Odyssey, wherein we are told that ""Euryalus,"
5853,BRONZE AND IRON,"the Phaeacian, presented to Odysseus a bronze sword, though, as we have"
5854,BRONZE AND IRON,"seen"" (Mr. Ridgeway has seen), ""the usual material for all such weapons"
5855,BRONZE AND IRON,is iron. But the Phoeacians both belonged to the older race and lived in
5856,BRONZE AND IRON,"a remote island, and therefore swords of bronze may well have continued"
5857,BRONZE AND IRON,in use in such out-of-the-world places long after iron swords were in
5858,BRONZE AND IRON,use everywhere else in Greece. The man who could not afford iron had to
5859,BRONZE AND IRON,"be satisfied with bronze."" [Footnote: _Early Age of Greece_, p. 305.]"
5860,BRONZE AND IRON,Here the poet is allowed to mean what he says. The Phaeacian sword is
5861,BRONZE AND IRON,"really of bronze, with silver studs, probably on the hilt (Odyssey,"
5862,BRONZE AND IRON,"VIII. 401-407), which was of ivory. The ""out-of-the-world"" islanders"
5863,BRONZE AND IRON,"could afford ivory, not iron. But when the same poet tells us that"
5864,BRONZE AND IRON,"the sword which Odysseus brought from Troy was ""a great silver-studded"
5865,BRONZE AND IRON,"bronze sword"" (Odyssey, X. 261, 262), then Mr. Ridgeway does not allow"
5866,BRONZE AND IRON,the poet to mean what he says. The poet is now using an epic formula
5867,BRONZE AND IRON,older than the age of iron swords.
5868,BRONZE AND IRON,
5869,BRONZE AND IRON,"That Mr. Ridgeway adopts Helbig's theory--the poet says ""bronze,"" by a"
5870,BRONZE AND IRON,"survival of the diction of the bronze age, when he means iron--I infer"
5871,BRONZE AND IRON,"from the following passage: ""_Chalkos_ is the name for the older metal,"
5872,BRONZE AND IRON,"of which cutting weapons were made, and it thus lingered in many phrases"
5873,BRONZE AND IRON,of the Epic dialect; 'to smite with the _chalkos_' was equivalent to our
5874,BRONZE AND IRON,"phrase 'to smite with the steel.'"" [Footnote: _Early Age of Greece_, i."
5875,BRONZE AND IRON,"295.] But we certainly do smite with the steel, while the question is,"
5876,BRONZE AND IRON,"""_DID_ Homer's men smite with the iron?"" Homer says not; he does not"
5877,BRONZE AND IRON,"merely use ""an epic phrase"" ""to smite with the _CHALKOS_,"" but he"
5878,BRONZE AND IRON,"carefully describes swords, spears, and usually arrow-heads as being"
5879,BRONZE AND IRON,"of bronze (_CHALKOS_), while axes, adzes, and knives are frequently"
5880,BRONZE AND IRON,described by him as of iron.
5881,BRONZE AND IRON,
5882,BRONZE AND IRON,"Mr. Ridgeway has an illustrative argument with some one, who says: ""The"
5883,BRONZE AND IRON,dress and weapons of the Saxons given in the lay of _Beowulf_ fitted
5884,BRONZE AND IRON,"exactly the bronze weapons in England, for they had shields, and spears,"
5885,BRONZE AND IRON,"and battle-axes, and swords."" If you pointed out to him that the Saxon"
5886,BRONZE AND IRON,"poem spoke of these weapons as made of iron, he would say, ""I admit"
5887,BRONZE AND IRON,"that it is a difficulty, but the resemblances are so many that the"
5888,BRONZE AND IRON,"discrepancies may be jettisoned."" [Footnote: _Ridgeway,_ i. 83, 84.]"
5889,BRONZE AND IRON,
5890,BRONZE AND IRON,"Now, if the supposed controversialist were a Homeric critic, he would"
5891,BRONZE AND IRON,"not admit any difficulty. He would say, ""Yes; in _Beowulf_ the"
5892,BRONZE AND IRON,"weapons are said to be of iron, but that is the work of the Christian"
5893,BRONZE AND IRON,"_remanieur,_ or _bearbeiter,_ who introduced all the Christian morality"
5894,BRONZE AND IRON,"into the old heathen lay, and who also, not to puzzle his iron-using"
5895,BRONZE AND IRON,"audience, changed the bronze into iron weapons."""
5896,BRONZE AND IRON,
5897,BRONZE AND IRON,"We may prove anything if we argue, now that the poets retain the"
5898,BRONZE AND IRON,"tradition of obsolete things, now that they modernise as much as they"
5899,BRONZE AND IRON,"please. Into this method of reasoning, after duly considering it, I"
5900,BRONZE AND IRON,"am unable to come with enthusiasm, being wedded to the belief that the"
5901,BRONZE AND IRON,"poets say what they mean. Were it otherwise, did they not mean what"
5902,BRONZE AND IRON,"they say, their evidence would be of no value; they might be dealing"
5903,BRONZE AND IRON,throughout in terms for things which were unrepresented in their own
5904,BRONZE AND IRON,"age. To prove this possible, it would be necessary to adduce convincing"
5905,BRONZE AND IRON,and sufficient examples of early national poets who habitually use
5906,BRONZE AND IRON,the terminology of an age long prior to their own in descriptions of
5907,BRONZE AND IRON,"objects, customs, and usages. Meanwhile, it is obvious that my whole"
5908,BRONZE AND IRON,"argument has no archaeological support. We may find ""Mycenaean"" corslets"
5909,BRONZE AND IRON,"and greaves, but they are not in cremation burials. No Homeric cairn"
5910,BRONZE AND IRON,with Homeric contents has ever been discovered; and if we did find
5911,BRONZE AND IRON,"examples of Homeric cairns, it appears, from the poems, that they would"
5912,BRONZE AND IRON,very seldom contain the arms of the dead.
5913,BRONZE AND IRON,
5914,BRONZE AND IRON,"Nowhere, again, do we find graves containing bronze swords and iron axes"
5915,BRONZE AND IRON,and adzes. I know nothing nearer in discoveries to my supposed age
5916,BRONZE AND IRON,of bronze weapons and iron tools than a grave of the early iron and
5917,BRONZE AND IRON,"geometrical ornament age of Crete--a _tholos_ tomb, with a bronze"
5918,BRONZE AND IRON,"spear-head and a set of iron tools, among others a double axe and a"
5919,BRONZE AND IRON,pick of iron. But these were in company with iron swords? To myself the
5920,BRONZE AND IRON,"crowning mystery is, what has become of the Homeric tumuli with their"
5921,BRONZE AND IRON,contents? One can but say that only within the last thirty years have we
5922,BRONZE AND IRON,"found, or, finding, have recognised Mycenaean burial records. As to the"
5923,BRONZE AND IRON,"badness of the iron of the North for military purposes, and the probable"
5924,BRONZE AND IRON,"badness of all early iron weapons, we have testimony two thousand years"
5925,BRONZE AND IRON,later than Homer and some twelve hundred years later than Polybius.
5926,BRONZE AND IRON,"In the Eyrbyggja Saga (Morris and Maguússon, chap, xxiv.) we read that"
5927,BRONZE AND IRON,"Steinthor ""was girt with a sword that was cunningly wrought; the hilts"
5928,BRONZE AND IRON,"were white with silver, and the grip wrapped round with the same, but"
5929,BRONZE AND IRON,"the strings thereof were gilded."" This was a splendid sword, described"
5930,BRONZE AND IRON,"with the Homeric delight in such things; but the battle-cry arises, and"
5931,BRONZE AND IRON,"then ""the fair-wrought sword bit not when it smote armour, and Steinthor"
5932,BRONZE AND IRON,"must _straighten it under_ his _foot._"" Messrs. Morris and Maguússon add"
5933,BRONZE AND IRON,"in a note: ""This is a very common experience in Scandinavian weapons,"
5934,BRONZE AND IRON,and for the first time heard of at the battle of Aquae Sextiae between
5935,BRONZE AND IRON,"Marius and the Teutons."" [Footnote: The reference is erroneous.] ""In the"
5936,BRONZE AND IRON,North weapon-smiths who knew how to forge tempered or steel-laminated
5937,BRONZE AND IRON,"weapons were, if not unknown, at least very rare."" When such skill was"
5938,BRONZE AND IRON,"unknown or rare in Homer's time, nothing was more natural than that"
5939,BRONZE AND IRON,"bronze should hold its own, as the metal for swords and spears, after"
5940,BRONZE AND IRON,iron was commonly used for axes and ploughshares.

5948,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,THE HOMERIC HOUSE
5949,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
5950,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"If the Homeric poems be, as we maintain, the work of a peculiar age, the"
5951,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Homeric house will also, in all likelihood, be peculiar. It will not"
5952,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,be the Hellenic house of classical times. Manifestly the dwelling of a
5953,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"military-prince in the heroic age would be evolved to meet his needs,"
5954,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,which were not the needs of later Hellenic citizens. In time of peace
5955,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"the later Greeks are weaponless men, not surrounded by and entertaining"
5956,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"throngs of armed retainers, like the Homeric chief. The women of later"
5957,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Greece, moreover, are in the background of life, dwelling in the women's"
5958,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"chambers, behind those of the men, in seclusion. The Homeric women also,"
5959,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"at least in the house of Odysseus, have their separate chambers, which"
5960,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"the men seem not to enter except on invitation, though the ladies freely"
5961,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"honour by their presence the hall of the warriors. The circumstances,"
5962,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"however, were peculiar--Penelope being unprotected in the absence of her"
5963,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,lord.
5964,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
5965,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,The whole domestic situation in the Homeric poems--the free equality
5966,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"of the women, the military conditions, the life of the chiefs and"
5967,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"retainers--closely resembles, allowing for differences of climate, that"
5968,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,of the rich landowners of early Iceland as described in the sagas. There
5969,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,can be no doubt that the house of the Icelandic chief was analogous to
5970,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the house of the Homeric prince. Societies remarkably similar in mode
5971,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,of life were accommodated in dwellings similarly arranged. Though
5972,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"the Icelanders owned no Over-Lord, and, indeed, left their native"
5973,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Scandinavia to escape the sway of Harold Fairhair, yet each wealthy and"
5974,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"powerful chief lived in the manner of a Homeric ""king."" His lands and"
5975,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"thralls, horses and cattle, occupied his attention when he did not"
5976,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"chance to be on Viking adventure--""bearing bane to alien men."" He"
5977,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"always carried sword and spear, and often had occasion to use them."
5978,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"He entertained many guests, and needed a large hall and ample sleeping"
5979,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,accommodation for strangers and servants. His women were as free and as
5980,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,much respected as the ladies in Homer; and for a husband to slap a wife
5981,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"was to run the risk of her deadly feud. Thus, far away in the frosts of"
5982,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"the north, the life of the chief was like that of the Homeric prince,"
5983,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,and their houses were alike.
5984,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
5985,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,It is our intention to use this parallel in the discussion of the
5986,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,Homeric house. All Icelandic chiefs' houses in the tenth and eleventh
5987,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"centuries were not precisely uniform in structure and accommodation,"
5988,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"and saga writers of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, living"
5989,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"more comfortably than their forefathers, sometimes confuse matters by"
5990,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,introducing the arrangements of their own into the tale of past times.
5991,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"But, in any case, one Icelandic house of the tenth or eleventh century"
5992,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"might differ from another in certain details. It is not safe, therefore,"
5993,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,to argue that difference of detail in Homer's accounts of various houses
5994,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,means that the varying descriptions were composed in different ages. In
5995,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the _Odyssey_ the plot demands that the poet must enter into domestic
5996,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,details much more freely than he ever has occasion to do in the Iliad.
5997,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"He may mention upper chambers freely, for example; it will not follow"
5998,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,that in the _Iliad_ upper chambers do not exist because they are only
5999,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,mentioned twice in that Epic.
6000,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6001,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,It is even more important to note that in the house of Odysseus we have
6002,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,an unparalleled domestic situation. The lady of the house is beset by
6003,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"more than a hundred wooers--""sorning"" on her, in the old Scots legal"
6004,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"phrase--making it impossible for her to inhabit her own hall, and"
6005,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,desirable to keep the women as much as possible apart from the men. Thus
6006,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"the Homeric house of which we know most, that of Odysseus, is a house in"
6007,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,a most abnormal condition.
6008,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6009,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,For the sake of brevity we omit the old theory that the Homeric
6010,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"house was practically that of historical Greece, with the men's hall"
6011,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,approached by a door from the courtyard; while a door at the upper end
6012,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,of the men's hall yields direct access to the quarters where the women
6013,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"dwelt apart, at the rear of the men's hall."
6014,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6015,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"That opinion has not survived the essay by Mr. J. L. Myres on the ""Plan"
6016,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"of the Homeric House."" [Footnote: _Journal of Hellenic Studies_, vol."
6017,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"XX, 128-150.] Quite apart from arguments that rest on the ground plans"
6018,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"of palaces at Mycenae and Tiryns, Mr. Myres has proved, by an exact"
6019,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"reading of the poet's words, that the descriptions in the _Odyssey_"
6020,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,cannot be made intelligible on the theory that the poet has in his mind
6021,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,a house of the Hellenic pattern. But in his essay he hardly touches on
6022,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"any Homeric house except that of Odysseus, in which the circumstances"
6023,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"were unusual. A later critic, Ferdinand Noack, has demonstrated that"
6024,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,we must take other Homeric houses into consideration. [Footnote:
6025,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"_Homerische Paläste_. Teubner. Leipzig, 1903.] The prae-Mycenaean"
6026,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"house is, according to Mr. Myres, on the whole of the same plan as the"
6027,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,Hellenic house of historic days; between these comes the Mycenaean and
6028,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Homeric house; ""so that the Mycenaean house stands out _as an intrusive"
6029,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"phenomenon_, of comparatively late arrival _and short of duration_..."""
6030,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"[Footnote: Myres, _Journal_ of _Hellenic_ Studies, vol. xx. p. 149.]"
6031,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,Noack goes further; he draws a line between the Mycenaean houses on one
6032,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,hand and the houses described by Homer on the other; while he thinks
6033,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"that the ""_late_ Homeric house,"" that of the closing Books of the"
6034,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Odyssey, is widely sundered from the Homeric house of the _Iliad_"
6035,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,and from the houses of Menelaus and Alcinous in earlier Books of the
6036,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"_Odyssey._ [Footnote: Noack, p. 73.]"
6037,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6038,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,In this case the Iliadic and earlier Odyssean houses are those of a
6039,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"single definite age, neither Mycenaean of the prime, nor Hellenic--a"
6040,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"fact which entirely suits our argument. But it is not so certain, that"
6041,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the house of Odysseus is severed from the other Homeric houses by the
6042,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"later addition of an upper storey, as Noack supposes, and of women's"
6043,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"quarters, and of separate sleeping chambers for the heads of the family."
6044,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6045,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"The _Iliad,_ save in two passages, and earlier Books of the _Odyssey_"
6046,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"may not mention upper storeys because they have no occasion, or only"
6047,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"rare occasion, to do so; and some houses may have had upper sleeping"
6048,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"chambers while others of the same period had not, as we shall prove from"
6049,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the Icelandic parallel.
6050,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6051,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Mr. Myres's idea of the Homeric house, or, at least, of the house of"
6052,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Odysseus, is that the women had a _meguron,_ or common hall, apart from"
6053,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"that of the men, with other chambers. These did not lie to the direct"
6054,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"rear of the men's hall, nor were they entered by a door that opened in"
6055,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"the back wall of the men's hall. Penelope has a chamber, in which"
6056,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"she sleeps and does woman's work, upstairs; her connubial chamber,"
6057,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"unoccupied during her lord's absence, is certainly on the ground floor."
6058,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,The women's rooms are severed from the men's hall by a courtyard; in
6059,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"the courtyard are chambers. Telemachus has his [Greek: Thalamos], or"
6060,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"chamber, in the men's courtyard. All this appears plain from the poet's"
6061,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"words; and Mr. Myres corroborates, by the ground plans of the palaces"
6062,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"of Tiryns and Mycenae, a point on which Mr. Monro had doubts, as regards"
6063,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Tiryns, while he accepted it for Mycenae. [Footnote: Monro, Odyssey, ii."
6064,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"497; _Journal of Hellenic Studies_, xx. 136.]"
6065,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6066,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Noack [Footnote: Noack, p. 39.] does not, however, agree."
6067,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6068,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,There appears to be no doubt that in the centre of the great halls of
6069,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Tiryns and of Mycenae, as of the houses in Homer, was the hearth, with"
6070,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"two tall pillars on each side, supporting a _louvre_ higher than the"
6071,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"rest of the roof, and permitting some, at least, of the smoke of"
6072,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the fire to escape. Beside the fire were the seats of the master and
6073,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"mistress of the house, of the minstrel, and of honoured guests. The"
6074,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"place of honour was not on a dais at the inmost end of the hall, like"
6075,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the high table in college halls. Mr. Myres holds that in the Homeric
6076,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"house the [Greek: prodomos], or ""forehouse,"" was a chamber, and was not"
6077,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"identical with the [Greek: aethousa], or portico, though he admits that"
6078,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"the two words ""are used indifferently to describe the sleeping place of"
6079,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"a guest."" [Footnote: _Journal of Hellenic Studies_, xx. 144, 155.] This"
6080,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"was the case at Tiryns; and in the house of the father of Phoenix,"
6081,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"in the _Iliad_, the _prodomos_, or forehouse, and the _aethousa_, or"
6082,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"portico, are certainly separate things (Iliad, IX. 473). Noack does not"
6083,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,accept the Tiryns evidence for the Homeric house.
6084,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6085,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"On Mr. Myres's showing, the women in the house of Odysseus had distinct"
6086,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,and separate quarters into which no man goes uninvited. Odysseus when at
6087,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"home has, with his wife, a separate bedroom; and in his absence Penelope"
6088,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"sleeps upstairs, where there are several chambers for various purposes."
6089,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6090,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Granting that all this is so, how do the pictures of the house given in"
6091,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the final part of the _Odyssey_ compare with those in the [Blank space]
6092,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,and with the accounts of the dwellings of Menelaus and Alcinous in the
6093,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,Odyssey? Noack argues that the house of Odysseus is unlike the other
6094,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Homeric houses, because in these, he reasons, the women have no separate"
6095,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"quarters, and the lord and lady of the house sleep in the great hall,"
6096,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"and have no other bedroom, while there are no upper chambers in the"
6097,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"houses of the _Iliad_, except in two passages dismissed as ""late."""
6098,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6099,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"If all this be so, then the Homeric period, as regards houses and"
6100,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"domestic life, belongs to an age apart, not truly Mycenaean, and still"
6101,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,less later Hellenic.
6102,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6103,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,It must be remembered that Noack regards the Odyssey as a composite and
6104,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,in parts very late mosaic (a view on which I have said what I think
6105,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,in _Homer and the Epic_). According to this theory (Kirchhoff is the
6106,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,exponent of a popular form thereof) the first Book of the Odyssey
6107,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"belongs to ""the latest stratum,"" and is the ""copy"" of the general"
6108,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"""worker-up,"" whether he was the editor employed by Pisistratus or a"
6109,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"laborious amateur. This theory is opposed by Sittl, who makes his point"
6110,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"by cutting out, as interpolations, whatever passages do not suit his"
6111,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"ideas, and do suit Kirchhoff's--this is the regular method of Homeric"
6112,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,criticism. The whole cruise of Telemachus (Book IV.) is also regarded
6113,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,as a late addition: on this point English scholars hitherto have been
6114,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"of the opposite opinion. [Footnote: Cf. Monro, _Odyssey_, vol. ii."
6115,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,313-317.]
6116,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6117,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,The method of all parties is to regard repetitions of phrases as
6118,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"examples of borrowing, except, of course, in the case of the earliest"
6119,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"poet from whom the others pilfer, and in other cases of prae-Homeric"
6120,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,surviving epic formulae. Critics then dispute as to which recurrent
6121,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"passage is the earlier, deciding, of course, as may happen to suit"
6122,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,their own general theory. In our opinion these passages are traditional
6123,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"formulae, as in our own old ballads and in the _Chansons de Geste_, and"
6124,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Noack also takes this view every now and then. They may well be older,"
6125,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"in many cases, than _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_; or the poet, having found"
6126,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"his own formula, economically used it wherever similar circumstances"
6127,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"occurred. Such passages, so considered, are no tests of earlier"
6128,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"composition in one place, of later composition in another."
6129,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6130,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,We now look into Noack's theory of the Homeric house. Where do the
6131,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"lord and lady sleep? _Not_, he says, as Odysseus and Penelope do (when"
6132,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Odysseus is at home), in a separate chamber (_thalamos_) on the ground"
6133,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"floor, nor, like Gunnar and Halgerda (Njal's Saga), in an upper chamber."
6134,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"They sleep _mucho domou_; that is, not in a separate recess in the"
6135,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"_house_, but in a recess of the great hall or _megaron_. Thus, in"
6136,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"the hall of Alcinous, the whole space runs from the threshold to the"
6137,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"_muchos_, the innermost part (_Odyssey_, VII. 87-96). In the hall of"
6138,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Odysseus, the Wooers retreat to the _muchos_, ""the innermost part of the"
6139,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"hall"" (_Odyssey_, XXII. 270). ""The _muchos_, in Homer, never denotes"
6140,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"a separate chamber."" [Footnote: Noack, p. 45. _Cf_. Monro, Note to"
6141,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Odyssey, XXII. 270.]"
6142,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6143,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"In Odyssey, XI. 373, Alcinous says it is not yet time to sleep _ev"
6144,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"megaro_, ""in the hall."" Alcinous and Arete, his wife, sleep ""in the"
6145,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"recess of the lofty _domos_,"" that is, in the recess of the _hall_, not"
6146,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"of ""the house"" (Odyssey, VII. 346). The same words are used of Helen and"
6147,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Menelaus (Odyssey, IV. 304). But when Menelaus goes forth next morning,"
6148,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"he goes _ek thalamoio_, ""out of his _chamber_"" (_Odyssey_, IV. 310). But"
6149,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"this, says Noack, is a mere borrowing of Odyssey, II 2-5, where the same"
6150,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"words are used of Telemachus, leaving his chamber, which undeniably was"
6151,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,a separate chamber in the court: Eurycleia lighted him thither at night
6152,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"(Odyssey, I. 428). In Odyssey, IV. 121, Helen enters the hall ""from her"
6153,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"fragrant, lofty chamber,"" so she _had_ a chamber, not in the hall. But,"
6154,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"says Noack, this verse ""is not original."" The late poet of _Odyssey_,"
6155,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"IV. has cribbed it from the early poet who composed _Odyssey, XIX. 53._"
6156,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"In that passage Penelope ""comes from her chamber, like Artemis or golden"
6157,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Aphrodite."" Penelope _had_ a chamber--being ""a lone lorn woman,"" who"
6158,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,could not sleep in a hall where the Wooers sat up late drinking--and
6159,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the latest poet transfers this chamber to Helen. But however late and
6160,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"larcenous he may have been, the poet of IV. 121 certainly did not crib"
6161,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"the words of the poet of XIX. 53, for he says, ""Helen came out of"
6162,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"her _fragrant, high-roofed_ chamber."" The _hall_ was not precisely"
6163,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"""fragrant""! However, Noack supposes that the late poet of Book IV. let"
6164,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Helen have a chamber apart, to lead up to the striking scene of her"
6165,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,entry to the hall where her guests are sitting. May Helen not even have
6166,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"a boudoir? In _Odyssey_, IV. 263, Helen speaks remorsefully of having"
6167,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"abandoned her ""chamber,"" and husband, and child, with Paris; but the"
6168,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"late poet says this, according to Noack, because he finds that he is"
6169,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"in for a chamber, so to speak, at all events, as a result of his having"
6170,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"previously cribbed the word ""chamber"" from Odyssey, XIX. 53. Otherwise,"
6171,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"we presume Helen would have said that she regretted having left ""the"
6172,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"recess of the lofty hall"" where she really did sleep. [Footnote: Noack,"
6173,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,pp. 47-48]
6174,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6175,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,The merit of this method of arguing may be left to the judgment of the
6176,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"reader, who will remark that wedded pairs are not described as leaving"
6177,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"the hall when they go to bed; they sleep in ""a recess of the lofty"
6178,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"house,"" the innermost part. Is this the same as the ""recess of the"
6179,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"_hall_"" or is it an innermost part of the _house?_ Who can be certain?"
6180,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6181,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"The bridal chamber, built so cunningly, with the trunk of a tree for the"
6182,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"support of the bed, by Odysseus (odyssey, XXIII. 177-204), is, according"
6183,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"to Noack, an exception, a solitary freak of Odysseus. But we may reply"
6184,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"that the _thalamos_, the separate chamber, is no freak; the freak, by"
6185,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"knowledge of which Odysseus proves his identity, is the use of the tree"
6186,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,in the construction of the bed. [blank space] was highly original.
6187,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6188,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"That separate chambers are needed for grown-up children, _BECAUSE_ the"
6189,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"parents sleep in the hall, is no strong argument. If the parents had a"
6190,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"separate chamber, the young people, unless they slept in the hall, would"
6191,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"still need their own. The girls, of course, could not sleep in the hall;"
6192,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"and, in the absence of both Penelope and Odysseus from the hall, ever"
6193,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"since Telemachus was a baby, Telemachus could have slept there. But it"
6194,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"will be replied that the Wooers did not beset the hall, and Penelope"
6195,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"did not retire to a separate chamber, till Telemachus was a big boy of"
6196,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"sixteen. Noack argues that he had a separate chamber, though the hall"
6197,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"was free, _tradition_. [Footnote: Noack, p. 49.]"
6198,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6199,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Where does Noack think that, in a normal Homeric house, the girls of"
6200,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"the family slept? _They_ could not sleep in the hall, and on the two"
6201,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,occasions when the _Iliad_ has to mention the chambers of the young
6202,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"ladies they are ""upper chambers,"" as is natural. But as Noack wants"
6203,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"to prove the house of Odysseus, with its upper chambers, to be a late"
6204,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"peculiar house, he, of course, expunges the two mentions of girls' upper"
6205,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,chambers in the _Odyssey_. The process is simple and easy.
6206,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6207,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"We find (_Iliad_, XVII. 36) that a son, wedding in his father's and"
6208,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"mother's life-time, has a _thalamos_ built for him, and a _muchos_"
6209,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"in the _THALAMOS_, where he leaves his wife when he goes to war. This"
6210,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"dwelling of grown-up married children, as in the case of the sons of"
6211,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Priam, has a _thalamos_, or _doma_, and a courtyard--is a house, in fact"
6212,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"(_Iliad_, VI. 3 16). Here we seem to distinguish the bed-chamber"
6213,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"from the _doma_, which is the hall. Noack objects that when Odysseus"
6214,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"fumigates his house, after slaying the Wooers, he thus treats the"
6215,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"_megaron_, _AND_ the _doma_, _AND_ the courtyard. Therefore, Noack"
6216,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"argues, the _megaron_, or hall, is one thing; the _doma_ is another. Mr."
6217,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Monro writes, ""_doma_ usually means _megaron_,"" and he supposes a"
6218,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"slip from another reading, _thalamon_ for _megaron_, which is not"
6219,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"satisfactory. But if _doma_ here be not equivalent to _megaron_, what"
6220,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,room can it possibly be? Who was killed in another place? what place
6221,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,therefore needed purification except the hall and courtyard? No other
6222,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,places needed purifying; there is therefore clearly a defect in the
6223,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,lines which cannot be used in the argument.
6224,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6225,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Noack, in any case, maintains that Paris has but one place to live in"
6226,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"by day and to sleep in by night--his [Greek: talamos]. There he sleeps,"
6227,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"eats, and polishes his weapons and armour. There Hector finds him"
6228,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"looking to his gear; Helen and the maids are all there (_Iliad,_ VI."
6229,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,321-323). Is this quite certain? Are Helen and the maids in the [Greek:
6230,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"talamos], where Paris is polishing his corslet and looking to his bow,"
6231,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"or in an adjacent room? If not in another room, why, when Hector is in"
6232,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"the room talking to Paris, does Helen ask him to ""come in""? (_Iliad,_"
6233,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"VI. 354). He is in, is there another room whence she can hear him?"
6234,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6235,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,The minuteness of these inquiries is tedious!
6236,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6237,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"In _Iliad,_ III. 125, Iris finds Helen ""in the hall"" weaving. She"
6238,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,summons her to come to Priam on the gate. Helen dresses in outdoor
6239,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"costume, and goes forth ""from the chamber,"" [Greek: talamos] (III."
6240,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"141-142). Are hall and chamber the same room, or did not Helen dress ""in"
6241,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"the chamber""? In the same Book (III. 174) she repents having left"
6242,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"the [Greek: talamos] of Menelaus, not his hall: the passage is not a"
6243,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,repetition in words of her speech in the Odyssey.
6244,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6245,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"The gods, of course, are lodged like men. When we find that Zeus has"
6246,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"really a separate sleeping chamber, built by Hephaestus, as Odysseus has"
6247,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"(_Iliad,_ XIV. 166-167), we are told that this is a late interpolation."
6248,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Mr. Leaf, who has a high opinion of this scene, ""the Beguiling of"
6249,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Zeus,"" places it in the ""second expansions""; he finds no ""late Odyssean"""
6250,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"elements in the language. In _Iliad,_ I. 608-611, Zeus ""departed to his"
6251,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"couch""; he seems not to have stayed and slept in the hall."
6252,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6253,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,Here a quaint problem occurs. Of all late things in the Odyssey the
6254,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,latest is said to be the song of Demodocus about the loves of Ares
6255,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"and Aphrodite in the house of Hephaestus. [Footnote: Odyssey, VIII."
6256,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,266-300.] We shall show that this opinion is far from certainly correct.
6257,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,Hephaestus sets a snare round the bed in his [Greek: talamos] and
6258,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"catches the guilty lovers. _Now_, was his [Greek: talamos] or bedroom,"
6259,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"also his dining-room? If so, the author of the song, though so ""late,"""
6260,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"knows what Noack knows, and what the poets who assign sleeping chambers"
6261,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"to wedded folks do not know, namely, that neither married gods nor"
6262,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"married men have separate bedrooms. This is plain, for he makes"
6263,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Hephaestus stand at the front door of his house, and shout to the gods"
6264,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"to come and see the sinful lovers. [Footnote: Ibid., VI. 304-305] They"
6265,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"all come and look on _from the front door_ (_Odyssey_, VII. 325), which"
6266,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"leads into the [Greek: megaron], the hall. If the lovers are in bed in"
6267,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"the hall, then hall and bedroom are all one, and the terribly late poet"
6268,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"who made this lay knows it, though the late poets of the _Odyssey_ and"
6269,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,_Iliad_ do not.
6270,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6271,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"It would appear that the author of the lay is not ""late,"" as we shall"
6272,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,prove in another case.
6273,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6274,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Noack, then, will not allow man or god to have a separate wedding"
6275,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"chamber, nor women, before the late parts of the _Odyssey_, to have"
6276,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"separate quarters, except in the house of Odysseus. Women's chambers"
6277,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"do not exist in the Homeric house. [Footnote: Noack, p. 50.] If so, how"
6278,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,remote is the true Homeric house from the house of historical Greece!
6279,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6280,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"As for upper chambers, those of the daughter of the house (_Iliad,_ II."
6281,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"514; XVI. 184), both passages are ""late,"" as we saw (Noack, p.[blank"
6282,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,space]). In the _Odyssey_ Penelope both sleeps and works at the shroud
6283,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,in an upper chamber. But the whole arrangement of upper chambers as
6284,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"women's apartments is as late, says Noack, as the time of the poets and"
6285,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"""redactors"" (whoever they may have been) of the Odyssey, XXI., XXII.,"
6286,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"XXIII. [Footnote: Noack, p. 68.] At the earliest these Books are said to"
6287,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,be of the eighth century B.C. Here the late poets have their innings at
6288,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"last, and do modernise the Homeric house."
6289,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6290,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,To prove the absence of upper rooms in the _Iliad_ we have to abolish
6291,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"II. 514, where Astyoche meets her divine lover in her upper chamber, and"
6292,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"XVI. 184, where Polymêlê celebrates her amour with Hermes ""in the upper"
6293,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"chambers."" The places where these two passages occur, _Catalogue_ (Book"
6294,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"II.) and the _Catalogue_ of the _Myrmidons_ (Book XVI.) are, indeed,"
6295,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"both called ""late,"" but the author of the latter knows the early law of"
6296,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"bride-price, which is supposed to be unknown to the authors of ""late"""
6297,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,passages in the Odyssey (XVI. 190).
6298,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6299,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Stated briefly, such are the ideas of Noack. They leave us, at least,"
6300,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"with permission to hold that the whole of the Epics, except Books XXI.,"
6301,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"XXII., and XXIII. of the Odyssey, bear, as regards the house, the marks"
6302,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"of a distinct peculiar age, coming between the period of Mycenae and"
6303,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,Tiryns on one hand and the eighth century B.C. on the other.
6304,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6305,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"This is the point for which we have contended, and this suits our"
6306,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"argument very well, though we are sorry to see that Odyssey, Books XXI.,"
6307,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"XXII., and XXIII., are no older than the eighth century B.C. But we have"
6308,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"not been quite convinced that Helen had not her separate chamber, that"
6309,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Zeus had not his separate chamber, and that the upper chambers of the"
6310,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"daughters of the house in the Iliad are ""late."" Where, if not in upper"
6311,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"chambers, did the young princesses repose? Again, the marked separation"
6312,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,of the women in the house of Odysseus may be the result of Penelope's
6313,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"care in unusual circumstances, though she certainly would not build"
6314,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,a separate hall for them. There are over a hundred handsome young
6315,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"scoundrels in her house all day long and deep into the night; she would,"
6316,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"vainly, do her best to keep her girls apart."
6317,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6318,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,It stands to reason that young girls of princely families would have
6319,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"bedrooms in the house, not in the courtyard-bedrooms out of the way of"
6320,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,enterprising young men. What safer place could be found for them than in
6321,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"upper chambers, as in the Iliad? But, if their lovers were gods, we"
6322,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"know that none ""can see a god coming or going against his will."" The"
6323,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,arrangements of houses may and do vary in different cases in the same
6324,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,age.
6325,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6326,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,As examples we turn to the parallel afforded by the Icelandic sagas and
6327,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,their pictures of houses of the eleventh century B.C. The present author
6328,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,long ago pointed out the parallel of the houses in the sagas and in
6329,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,Homer. [Footnote: _The_ House. Butcher and Lang. Translation of the
6330,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,Odyssey.] He took his facts from Dasent's translation of the Njal Saga
6331,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"(1861, vol. i. pp. xcviii., ciii., with diagrams). As far as he is"
6332,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"aware, no critic looked into the matter till Mr. Monro (1901), being"
6333,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"apparently unacquainted with Dasent's researches, found similar lore in"
6334,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"works by Dr. Valtyr Gudmundsson [Footnote: Monro, Odyssey, vol. ii."
6335,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"pp. 491-495; _cf_. Gudmundsson, _Der Islandske Bottg i Fristats Tiden_,"
6336,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"1894; _cf_. Dasent, _Oxford_ Essays, 1858.] The roof of the hall is"
6337,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"supported by four rows of columns, the two inner rows are taller, and"
6338,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"between them is the hearth, with seats of honour for the chief guests"
6339,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,and the lord. The fire was in a kind of trench down the hall; and in
6340,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"very cold weather, we learn from Dasent, long fires could be lit through"
6341,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the extent of the hall. The chief had a raised seat; the guests sat on
6342,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,benches. The high seats were at the centre; not till later times on the
6343,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"dais, as in a college hall. The tables were relatively small, and, as in"
6344,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Homer, could be removed after a meal. The part of the hall with the"
6345,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,dais in later days was partitioned off as a _stofa_ or parlour. In early
6346,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,times cooking was done in the hall.
6347,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6348,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Dr. Gudmundsson, if I understand him, varies from Dasent in some"
6349,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,respects. I quote an abstract of his statement.
6350,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6351,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"""About the year 1000 houses generally consisted of, at least, four"
6352,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"rooms; often a fifth was added, the so-called bath-room. The oldest form"
6353,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,for houses was that of one long line or row of separate rooms united by
6354,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"wooden or clay corridors or partitions, and each covered with a roof."
6355,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Later, this was considered unpractical, and they began building some of"
6356,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"the houses or rooms behind the others, which facilitated the access from"
6357,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"one to another, and diminished the number of outer doors and corridors."""
6358,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6359,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"""Towards the latter part of the tenth century the _skaal_ was used as"
6360,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"common sleeping-room for the whole family, including servants and serfs;"
6361,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"it was fitted up in the same way as the hall. Like this, it was divided"
6362,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,in three naves by rows of wooden pillars; the middle floor was lower
6363,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,than that of the two side naves. In these were placed the so-called
6364,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"_saet_ or bed-places, not running the whole length of the [blank space]"
6365,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"from gable to gable, but sideways, filling about a third part. Each"
6366,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"_saet_ was enclosed by broad, strong planks joined into the pillars, but"
6367,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"not nailed on, so they might easily be taken out. These planks, called"
6368,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"_SATTESTOKKE_, could also be turned sideways and used as benches during"
6369,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"the day; they were often beautifully carved, and consequently highly"
6370,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"valued."""
6371,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6372,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"""When settling abroad the people took away with them these planks, and"
6373,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,put them up in their new home as a symbol of domestic happiness. The
6374,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,_saet_ was occupied by the servants of the farm as sleeping-rooms;
6375,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"generally it was screened by hangings and low panels, which partitioned"

6381,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"bed-clothes, but only in very wealthy houses were they also provided"
6382,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"for the servants. Moveable beds were extremely rare, but are sometimes"
6383,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"mentioned. Generally two people slept in each bed."""
6384,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,
6385,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"""In the further end of the _skaal_, facing the door, opened out one or"
6386,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"several small bedrooms, destined for the husband with wife and children,"
6387,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"besides other members of the family, including guests of a higher"
6388,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,standing. These small dormitories were separated by partitions of planks
6389,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"into bedrooms with one or several beds, and shut away from the outer"
6390,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,_SKAAL_ either by a sliding-door in the wall or by an ordinary door

6449,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,"Guests did not sleep, as in Homer, in the _prodomos_, or the"

6474,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,between that and other Homeric houses may be no more than the
6475,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,differences between various Icelandic dwellings. The parents might sleep
6476,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,in bedchambers off the hall or in upper chambers. Ladies might have
6477,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,bowers in the courtyard or might have none. The [Greek: laurae]--each

6622,"NOTES OF CHANGE IN THE ""ODYSSEY""","means ""from the summit of Olympus, which, though Homer does not identify"

6638,"NOTES OF CHANGE IN THE ""ODYSSEY""","is Iris the messenger, not Hermes? _Iliad_, Book XXIII., is also a late"

6647,"NOTES OF CHANGE IN THE ""ODYSSEY""","through the age of the Odyssey, and later. In the Odyssey the beggar"

6650,"NOTES OF CHANGE IN THE ""ODYSSEY""",so-called late Odyssean Books of the _Iliad_. The poet of the Odyssey
6651,"NOTES OF CHANGE IN THE ""ODYSSEY""",knew all about Iris; there had arisen no change of belief; he merely

6654,"NOTES OF CHANGE IN THE ""ODYSSEY""",
6655,"NOTES OF CHANGE IN THE ""ODYSSEY""",(4) Another difference is that in the _Iliad_ the wife of Hephaestus is

6916,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,The great strength of the theory that the poems are the work of several
6917,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"ages is the existence in them of various strata of languages, earlier"
6918,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,and later.
6919,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
6920,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"Not to speak of differences of vocabulary, Mr. Monro and Mr. Leaf, with"
6921,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"many scholars, detect two strata of earlier and later _grammar_ in Iliad"
6922,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"and Odyssey. In the _Iliad_ four or five Books are infected by ""the"
6923,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"later grammar,"" while the Odyssey in general seems to be contaminated."
6924,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"Mr. Leafs words are: ""When we regard the Epos in large masses, we see"
6925,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,that we can roughly arrange the inconsistent elements towards one end or
6926,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,the other of a line of development both linguistic and historical. The
6927,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"main division, that of _Iliad_ and Odyssey, shows a distinct advance"
6928,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,along this line; and the distinction is still more marked if we group
6929,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,with the _Odyssey_ four Books of the _Iliad_ whose Odyssean physiognomy
6930,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,is well marked. Taking as our main guide the dissection of the plot as
6931,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"shown in its episodes, we find that marks of lateness, though nowhere"
6932,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"entirely absent, group themselves most numerously in the later additions"
6933,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"..."" [Footnote: _Iliad_, vol. ii. p. X.] We are here concerned with"
6934,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"_linguistic_ examples of ""lateness."" The ""four Books whose Odyssean"

6936,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"Here Mr. Leaf, Mr. Monro, and many authorities are agreed. But to these"
6937,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"four Odyssean Books of the _Iliad_ Mr. Leaf adds _Iliad_, XI. 664-772:"
6938,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"""probably a later addition,"" says Mr. Monro. ""It is notably Odyssean in"
6939,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"character,"" says Mr. Leaf; and the author ""is ignorant of the geography"
6940,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"of the Western Peloponnesus. No doubt the author was an Asiatic Greek."""
6941,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"[Footnote: _Iliad_, vol. i. pp. 465-466. Note on Book XI. 756.] The"
6942,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,value of this discovery is elsewhere discussed (see _The Interpolations
6943,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,of Nestor_).
6944,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
6945,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"The Odyssean notes in this passage of a hundred lines (_Iliad_, XI."
6946,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"670-762) are the occurrence of ""a purely Odyssean word"" (677), an Attic"
6947,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"form of an epic word, and a ""forbidden trochaic caesura in the fourth"
6948,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"foot""; an Odyssean word for carving meat, applied in a _non_-Odyssean"
6949,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"sense (688), a verb for ""insulting,"" not elsewhere found in the _Iliad_"
6950,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"(though the noun is in the _Iliad_) (695), an Odyssean epithet of the"
6951,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"sun, ""four times in the _Odyssey_"" (735). It is also possible that there"
6952,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,is an allusion to a four-horse chariot (699).
6953,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
6954,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,These are the proofs of Odyssean lateness.
6955,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
6956,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,The real difficulty about Odyssean words and grammar in the _Iliad_
6957,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"is that, if they were in vigorous poetic existence down to the time of"
6958,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,Pisistratus (as the Odysseanism of the Asiatic editor proves that they
6959,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"were), and if every rhapsodist could add to and alter the materials at"
6960,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"the disposal of the Pisistratean editor at will, we are not told how the"
6961,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"fashionable Odysseanisms were kept, on the whole, out of twenty Books of"
6962,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,the Iliad.
6963,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
6964,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"This is a point on which we cannot insist too strongly, as an argument"
6965,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"against the theory that, till the middle of the sixth century B.C., the"
6966,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,_Iliad_ scarcely survived save in the memory of strolling rhapsodists.
6967,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"If that were so, all the Books of the _Iliad_ would, in the course"
6968,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"of recitation of old and composition of new passages, be equally"
6969,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,contaminated with late Odyssean linguistic style. It could not be
6970,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,otherwise; all the Books would be equally modified in passing through
6971,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"the lips of modern reciters and composers. Therefore, if twenty out"
6972,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"of twenty-four Books are pure, or pure in the main, from Odysseanisms,"
6973,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"while four are deeply stained with them, the twenty must not only be"
6974,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"earlier than the four, but must have been specially preserved, and kept"
6975,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"uncontaminated, in some manner inconsistent with the theory that all"
6976,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,alike scarcely existed save in the memory or invention of late strolling
6977,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,reciters.
6978,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
6979,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"How the twenty Books relatively pure ""in grammatical forms, in syntax,"
6980,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"and in vocabulary,"" could be kept thus clean without the aid of written"
6981,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"texts, I am unable to imagine. If left merely to human memory and at"
6982,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"the mercy of reciters and new poets, they would have become stained with"
6983,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"""the defining article""--and, indeed, an employment of the article which"
6984,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"startles grammarians, appears even in the eleventh line of the First"
6985,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,Book of the _Iliad_? [Footnote (exact placing uncertain): Cf. Monro and

6987,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
6988,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"Left merely to human memory and the human voice, the twenty more"
6989,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"or less innocent Books would have abounded, like the Odyssey, in"

6991,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"consequence of,"" and ""the extension of the use of [Greek: ei] clauses"

6993,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"interesting to grammarians. [Footnote: Monro, _Odyssey_, ii. pp."
6994,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"331-333.] But the twenty Books are almost, or quite, inoffensive in"
6995,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,these respects.
6996,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
6997,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"Now, even in ages of writing, it has been found difficult or impossible"
6998,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,to keep linguistic novelties and novelties of metre out of old epics. We
6999,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"later refer (_Archaeology of the Epic_) to the _Chancun de Willame_,"
7000,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,of which an unknown benefactor printed two hundred copies in 1903.
7001,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"Mr. Raymond Weeks, in _Romania_, describes _Willame_ as taking a place"
7002,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,beside the _Chanson de Roland_ in the earliest rank of _Chansons de
7003,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"Geste_. If the text can be entirely restored, the poem will appear"
7004,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"as ""the most primitive"" of French epics of the eleventh and twelfth"
7005,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,centuries. But it has passed from copy to copy in the course of
7006,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"generations. The methods of versification change, and, after line 2647,"
7007,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"""there are traces of change in the language. The word _ço_, followed"
7008,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"by a vowel, hitherto frequent, never again reappears. The vowel _i_,"

7010,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"""never occurs in the text after line 2647. Up to that point it is elided"
7011,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,or not at pleasure.... There is a progressive tendency towards hiatus.
7012,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,After line 1980 the system of assonance changes. _An_ and en have
7013,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"been kept distinct hitherto; this ceases to be the case."" [Footnote:"
7014,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"_Romania_, xxxiv. pp. 240-246.]"
7015,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
7016,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"The poem is also notable, like the _Iliad_, for textual repetition of"
7017,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"passages, but that is common to all early poetry, which many Homeric"
7018,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,critics appear not to understand. In this example we see how apt
7019,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,novelties in grammar and metre are to steal into even written copies of
7020,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"epics, composed in and handed down through uncritical ages; and we are"
7021,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,confirmed in the opinion that the relatively pure and orthodox grammar
7022,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,and metre of the twenty Books must have been preserved by written texts
7023,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"carefully 'executed. The other four Books, if equally old, were less"
7024,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"fortunate. Their grammar and metre, we learn, belong to a later stratum"
7025,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,of language.
7026,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
7027,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,These opinions of grammarians are not compatible with the hypothesis
7028,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"that _all_ of the _Iliad_, even the ""earliest"" parts, are loaded with"
7029,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"interpolations, forced in at different places and in any age from 1000"
7030,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"B.C. to 540 B.C.; for if that theory were true, the whole of the _Iliad_"
7031,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,would equally be infected with the later Odyssean grammar. According to
7032,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"Mr. Monro and Sir Richard Jebb, it is not."
7033,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
7034,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"But suppose, on the other hand, that the later Odyssean grammar abounds"
7035,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"all through the whole _Iliad_, then that grammar is not more Odyssean"
7036,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"than it is Iliadic. The alleged distinction of early Iliadic grammar,"
7037,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"late Odyssean grammar, in that case vanishes. Mr. Leaf is more keen than"
7038,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,Mr. Monro and Sir Richard Jebb in detecting late grammar in the _Iliad_
7039,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"beyond the bounds of Books IX., X., XXIII., XXIV. But he does not carry"
7040,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,these discoveries so far as to make the late grammar no less Iliadic
7041,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"than Odyssean. In Book VIII. of the _Iliad_, which he thinks was only"
7042,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"made for the purpose of introducing Book IX., [Footnote: _Iliad_, vol."
7043,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,i. p. 332. 1900.] we ought to find the late Odyssean grammar just as
7044,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"much as we do in Book IX., for it is of the very same date, and probably"
7045,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,by one or more of the same authors as Book IX. But we do not find the
7046,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,Odyssean grammar in Book VIII.
7047,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
7048,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"Mr. Leaf says, ""The peculiar character"" of Book VIII. ""is easily"
7049,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"understood, when we recognise the fact that Book VIII. is intended to"
7050,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"serve only as a means for the introduction of Book IX...."" which is"
7051,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"""late"" and ""Odyssean."" Then Book VIII., intended to introduce Book IX.,"
7052,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,must be at least as late as Book IX. and might be expected to be at
7053,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"least as Odyssean, indeed one would think it could not be otherwise. Yet"
7054,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,it is not so.
7055,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
7056,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,Mr. Leaf's theory has thus to face the difficulty that while the whole
7057,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"_Iliad_, by his view, for more than four centuries, was stuffed with"
7058,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"late interpolations, in the course of oral recital through all"
7059,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"Greek lands, and was crammed with original ""copy"" by a sycophant of"
7060,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"Pisistratus about 540 B.C., the late grammar concentrated itself in"
7061,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,only some four Books. Till some reasonable answer is given to this
7062,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,question--how did twenty Books of the Iliad preserve so creditably
7063,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"the ancient grammar through centuries of change, and of recitation by"
7064,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"rhapsodists who used the Odyssean grammar, which infected the four other"
7065,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"Books, and the whole of the _Odyssey?_--it seems hardly worth while to"
7066,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,discuss this linguistic test.
7067,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
7068,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,Any scholar who looks at these pages knows all about the proofs of
7069,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,grammar of a late date in the _Odyssey_ and the four contaminated Books
7070,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"of the _Iliad_. But it may be well to give a few specimens, for the"
7071,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,enlightenment of less learned readers of Homer.
7072,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,

7081,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
7082,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"Here, again, we ask: how did the contaminated Books of the _Iliad_"

7102,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,not much in this.
7103,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
7104,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"[Greek: proti] with the dative, meaning ""in addition to,"" occurs"

7110,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,in the _Iliad_. Odysseus and his men are not described as going on board
7111,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"their ship, in so many words, in _Iliad_, Book I. The usage occurs in"
7112,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"the poem where the incidents of seafaring occur frequently, as is to be"
7113,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,expected? It is not worth while to persevere with these tithes of mint

7116,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"do the failings not beset _Iliad_, IX., X., these being such extremely"
7117,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"""late"" books? As to the later use of the Article in the _Odyssey_ and"
7118,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"the Odyssean Books of the _Iliad_, it appears to us that Book I. of the"
7119,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,_Iliad_ uses the article as it is used in Book X.; but on this topic we
7120,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"must refer to a special treatise on the language of _Iliad_, Book X.,"
7121,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,which is promised.
7122,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
7123,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"Turning to the vocabulary: ""words expressive of civilisation"" are bound"
7124,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"to be more frequent, as they are, in the Odyssey, a poem of peaceful"
7125,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"life, than in a poem about an army in action, like the _Iliad_. Out of"
7126,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,all this no clue to the distance of years dividing the two poems can be
7127,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"found. As to words concerning religion, the same holds good. The Odyssey"
7128,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,is more frequently _religious_ (see the case of Eumaeus) than the
7129,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,_Iliad_.
7130,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
7131,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"In morals the term [Greek: dikaios] is more used in the _Odyssey_, also"
7132,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"[Greek: atemistos] (""just"" and ""lawless""). But that is partly because"

7134,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"people--Cyclopes and Laestrygons, who are ""lawless."" The _Iliad_ has no"
7135,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"occasion to touch on savages; but, as the [Greek: hybris] of the Wooers"
7136,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"is a standing topic in the Odyssey (an ethical poem, says Aristotle),"
7137,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"the word [Greek: hybris] is of frequent occurrence in the _Odyssey_,"
7138,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"in just the same sense as it bears in _Iliad_, I 214--the insolence"
7139,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,of Agamemnon. Yet when Achilles has occasion to speak of Agamemnon's
7140,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"insolence in _Iliad_, Book IX., he does not use the _word_ [Greek:"
7141,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"hybris], though Book IX. is so very ""late"" and ""Odyssean."" It would be"
7142,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"easy to go through the words for moral ideas in the _Odyssey_, and"
7143,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,to show that they occur in the numerous moral situations which do not
7144,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"arise, or arise much less frequently, in the _Iliad_. There is not"
7145,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,difference enough in the moral standard of the two poems to justify us
7146,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,in assuming that centuries of ethical progress had intervened between
7147,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"their dates of composition. If the _Iliad_, again, were really, like the"
7148,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"_Odyssey_, a thing of growth through several centuries, which overlapped"
7149,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"the centuries in which the _Odyssey_ grew, the moral ideas of the"
7150,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"_Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ would necessarily be much the same, would be"
7151,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"indistinguishable. But, as a matter of fact, it would be easy to show"
7152,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"that the moral standard of the _Iliad_ is higher, in many places,"
7153,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"than the moral standard of the _Odyssey_; and that, therefore, by the"
7154,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"critical hypothesis, the _Iliad_ is the later poem of the twain. For"
7155,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"example, the behaviour of Achilles is most obnoxious to the moralist in"
7156,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"_Iliad_, Book IX., where he refuses gifts of conciliation. But by the"
7157,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"critical hypothesis this is not the fault of the _Iliad_, for Book IX."
7158,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"is declared to be ""late,"" and of the same date as late parts of the"
7159,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,_Odyssey_. Achilles is not less open to moral reproach in his abominable
7160,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"cruelty and impiety, as shown in his sacrifice of prisoners of war and"
7161,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"his treatment of dead Hector, in _Iliad_, XXIII., XXIV. But these Books"
7162,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,also are said to be as late as the _Odyssey_.
7163,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
7164,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"The solitary ""realistic"" or ""naturalistic"" passage in Homer, with which"
7165,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"a lover of modern ""problem novels"" feels happy and at home, is the story"
7166,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"of Phoenix, about his seduction of his father's mistress at the"
7167,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,request of his mother. What a charming situation! But that occurs in an
7168,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"""Odyssean"" Book of the _Iliad_, Book IX.; and thus Odyssean seems lower,"
7169,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"not more advanced, than Iliadic taste in morals. To be sure, the poet"
7170,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,disapproves of all these immoralities.
7171,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
7172,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"In the Odyssey the hero, to the delight of Athene, lies often and freely"
7173,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"and with glee. The Achilles of the _Iliad_ hates a liar ""like the gates"
7174,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"of Hades""; but he says so in an ""Odyssean"" Book (Book IX.), so there"
7175,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,were obviously different standards in Odyssean ethics.
7176,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
7177,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"As to the Odyssey being the work of ""a milder age,"" consider the hanging"
7178,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,of Penelope's maids and the abominable torture of Melanthius. There is
7179,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,no torturing in the [blank space] for the _Iliad_ happens not to deal
7180,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,with treacherous thralls.
7181,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
7182,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"_Enfin_, there is no appreciable moral advance in the _ODYSSEY_ on the"
7183,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"moral standard of the _ILIAD_. It is rather the other way. Odysseus, in"
7184,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"the _ODYSSEY_, tries to procure poison for his arrow-heads. The person"
7185,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,to whom he applies is too moral to oblige him. We never learn that
7186,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,a hero of the _Iliad_ would use poisoned arrows. The poet himself
7187,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,obviously disapproves; in both poems the poet is always on the side of
7188,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,morality and of the highest ethical standard of his age. The standard in
7189,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,both Epics is the same; in both some heroes fall short of the standard.
7190,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
7191,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"To return to linguistic tests, it is hard indeed to discover what Mr."
7192,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,Leaf's opinion of the value of linguistic tests of lateness really is.
7193,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"""It is on such fundamental discrepancies""--as he has found in Books IX.,"
7194,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"XVI.--""that we can depend, _AND ON THESE ALONE_, when we come to dissect"
7195,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,the _ILIAD_ ... Some critics have attempted to base their analysis on
7196,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"evidences from language, but I do not think they are sufficient to"
7197,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"bear the super-structure which has been raised on them."" [Footnote:"
7198,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"_Companion,_ p. 25.]"
7199,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
7200,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"He goes on, still placing a low value on linguistic tests alone, to say:"
7201,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"""It is on the broad grounds of the construction and motives of the poem,"
7202,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"_AND NOT ON ANY MERELY linguistic CONSIDERATIONS_, that a decision must"

7204,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
7205,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"But he contradicts these comfortable words when he comes to ""the latest"
7206,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"expansions,"" such as Books XXIII., XXIV. ""The latest expansions are"
7207,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"thoroughly in the spirit of those which precede, _them ON ACCOUNT OF"
7208,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"linguistic EVIDENCE,_ which definitely classes them with the _ODYSSEY_"
7209,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"rather than the rest of the _ILIAD_."" [Footnote: _Iliad_, vol. ii. p."
7210,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,xiv.]
7211,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
7212,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"Now as Mr. Leaf has told us that we must depend on ""fundamental"
7213,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"discrepancies,"" ""on these alone,"" when we want to dissect the _ILIAD;_"
7214,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"as he has told us that linguistic tests alone are ""not sufficient to"
7215,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"bear the superstructure,"" &c., how can we lop off two Books ""only on"
7216,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"account of linguistic evidence""? It would appear that on this point,"
7217,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"as on others, Mr. Leaf has entirely changed his mind. But, even in the"
7218,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"_Companion_ (p. 388), he had amputated Book XXIV. for no ""fundamental"
7219,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"discrepancy,"" but because of ""its close kinship to the _ODYSSEY_, as in"
7220,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"the whole language of the Book."""
7221,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
7222,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"Here, as in many other passages, if we are to account for discrepancies"
7223,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"by the theory of multiplex authorship, we must decide that Mr. Leaf's"
7224,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"books are the work of several critics, not of one critic only. But there"
7225,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,is excellent evidence to prove that here we would be mistaken.
7226,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
7227,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"Confessedly and regretfully no grammarian, I remain unable, in face of"
7228,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"what seem contradictory assertions about the value of linguistic tests,"
7229,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"to ascertain what they are really worth, and what, if anything, they"
7230,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,really prove.
7231,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
7232,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"Mr. Monro allows much for ""the long insensible influence of Attic"
7233,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"recitation upon the Homeric text;"" ... ""many Attic peculiarities may"
7234,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"be noted"" (so much so that Aristarchus thought Homer must have been"
7235,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"an Athenian!). ""The poems suffered a gradual and unsystematic because"
7236,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"generally unconscious process of modernising, the chief agents in"
7237,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"which were the rhapsodists"" (reciters in a later democratic age), ""who"
7238,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"wandered over all parts of Greece, and were likely to be influenced by"
7239,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"all the chief forms of literature."" [Footnote: Monro, _Homeric Grammar_,"
7240,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,pp 394-396. 1891]
7241,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
7242,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"Then, wherefore insist so much on tests of language?"
7243,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
7244,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,Mr. Monro was not only a great grammarian; he had a keen appreciation
7245,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"of poetry. Thus he was conspicuously uneasy in his hypothesis, based on"
7246,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"words and grammar, that the two last Books of the _Iliad_ are by a late"
7247,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"hand. After quoting Shelley's remark that, in these two Books, ""Homer"
7248,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"truly begins to be himself,"" Mr. Monro writes, ""in face of such"
7249,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"testimony can we say that the Book in which the climax is reached, in"
7250,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,which the last discords of the _Iliad_ are dissolved in chivalrous pity
7251,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"and regret, is not the work of the original poet, but of some Homerid or"
7252,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"rhapsodist?"""
7253,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
7254,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"Mr. Monro, with a struggle, finally voted for grammar, and other"
7255,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"indications of lateness, against Shelley and against his own sense of"
7256,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"poetry. In a letter to me of May 1905, Mr. Monro sketched a theory that"
7257,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,Book IX. (without which he said that he deemed an _Achilleis_ hardly
7258,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,possible) might be a _remanié_ representative of an earlier lay to the
7259,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"same general effect. Some Greek Shakespeare, then, treated an older poem"
7260,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"on the theme of Book IX. as Shakespeare treated old plays, namely, as a"
7261,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,canvas to work over with a master's hand. Probably Mr. Monro would
7262,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"not have gone _so_ far in the case of Book XXIV., _The Repentance_ of"
7263,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,Achilles. He thought it in too keen contrast with the brutality of Book
7264,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,XXII. (obviously forgetting that in Book XXIV. Achilles is infinitely
7265,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"more brutal than in Book XXII.), and thought it inconsistent with the"
7266,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"refusal of Achilles to grant burial at the prayer of the dying Hector,"
7267,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,and with his criminal treatment of the dead body of his chivalrous
7268,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,enemy. But in Book XXIV. his ferocity is increased. Mr. Leaf shares
7269,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,Mr. Monro's view; but Mr. Leaf thinks that a Greek audience forgave
7270,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"Achilles, because he was doing ""the will of heaven,"" and ""fighting the"
7271,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"great fight of Hellenism against barbarism."" [Footnote: Leaf, _Iliad,_"
7272,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,vol.-ii. p. 429. 1902.] But the Achzeans were not Puritans of the
7273,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"sixteenth century! Moreover, the Trojans are as ""Hellenic"" as the"
7274,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"Achzeans. They converse, clearly, in the same language. They worship"
7275,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,the same gods. The Achzeans cannot regard them (unless on account of the
7276,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"breach of truce, by no Trojan, but an ally) as the Covenanters regarded"
7277,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"""malignants,"" their name for loyal cavaliers, whom they also styled"
7278,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"""Amalekites,"" and treated as Samuel treated Agag. The Achaeans to whom"
7279,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,Homer sang had none of this sanguinary Pharisaism.
7280,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
7281,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,Others must decide on the exact value and import of Odyssean grammar
7282,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"as a test of lateness, and must estimate the probable amount of time"
7283,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,required for the development of such linguistic differences as they find
7284,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,in the _Odyssey_ and _Iliad_. In undertaking this task they may compare
7285,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,the literary language of America as it was before 1860 and as it is now.
7286,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,The language of English literature has also been greatly modified in
7287,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"the last forty years, but our times are actively progressive in many"
7288,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,directions; linguistic variations might arise more slowly in the Greece
7289,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"of the Epics. We have already shown, in the more appropriate instance"
7290,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"of the _Chancun de Willame_, that considerable varieties in diction and"
7291,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"metre occur in a single MS. of that poem, a MS. written probably within"
7292,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,less than a century of the date of the poem's composition.
7293,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,
7294,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"We can also trace, in _remaniements_ of the _Chanson DE ROLAND_,"
7295,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,comparatively rapid and quite revolutionary variations from the
7296,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,oldest--the Oxford--manuscript. Rhyme is substituted for assonance;
7297,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"the process entails frequent modernisations, and yet the basis of"
7298,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,thirteenth-century texts continues to be the version of the eleventh
7299,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,century. It may be worth the while of scholars to consider these
7300,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"parallels carefully, as regards the language and prosody of the Odyssean"
7301,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"Books of the _Iliad_, and to ask themselves whether the processes of"
7302,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"alteration in the course of transmission, which we know to have occurred"
7303,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"in the history of the Old French, may not also have affected the"
7304,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"_ILIAD_, though why the effect is mainly confined to four Books remains"
7305,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,a puzzle. It is enough for us to have shown that if Odyssean varies from
7306,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"Iliadic language, in all other respects the two poems bear the marks"
7307,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"of the same age. Meanwhile, a Homeric scholar so eminent as Mr. T. W."
7308,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"Allen, says that ""the linguistic attack upon their age"" (that of the"
7309,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"Homeric poems) ""may be said to have at last definitely failed, and"
7310,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,archaeology has erected an apparently indestructible buttress for their
7311,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,"defence."" [Footnote: _Classical Review, May_ 1906, p. 194.]"

7950,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,That several of the passages in which Nestor speaks are very late
7951,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"interpolations, meant to glorify Pisistratus, himself of Nestor's line,"
7952,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,is a critical opinion to which we have more than once alluded. The first
7953,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"example is in _Iliad,_ II. 530-568. This passage ""is meant at once"
7954,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"to present Nestor as the leading counsellor of the Greek army, and to"
7955,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"introduce the coming _Catalogue_."" [Footnote: Leaf, _Iliad,_ vol. i. p."
7956,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"70.] Now the _Catalogue_ ""originally formed an introduction to the whole"
7957,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"Cycle."" [Footnote: Ibid., vol. i. p. 87.] But, to repeat an earlier"
7958,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"observation, surely the whole Cycle was much later than the period of"
7959,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"Pisistratus and his sons; that is, the compilation of the Homeric and"
7960,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"Cyclic poems into one body of verse, named ""The Cycle,"" is believed to"
7961,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,have been much later.
7962,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,
7963,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"It is objected that Nestor's advice in this passage, ""Separate thy"
7964,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"warriors by tribes and clans"" ([Greek: phyla, phraetras]), ""is out of"
7965,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"place in the last year of the war""; but this suggestion for military"
7966,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"reorganisation may be admitted as a mere piece of poetical perspective,"
7967,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"like Helen's description of the Achaean chiefs in Book III, or Nestor"
7968,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,may wish to return to an obsolete system of clan regiments. The
7969,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"Athenians had ""tribes"" and ""clans,"" political institutions, and Nestor's"
7970,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,advice is noted as a touch of late Attic influence; but about the nature
7971,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,and origin of these social divisions we know so little that it is vain
7972,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,to argue about them. The advice of Nestor is an appeal to the clan
7973,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"spirit--a very serviceable military spirit, as the Highlanders have"
7974,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,often proved--but we have no information as to whether it existed in
7975,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,Achaean times. Nestor speaks as the aged Lochiel spoke to Claverhouse
7976,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,before Killiecrankie. Did the Athenian army of the sixth century
7977,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,fight in clan regiments? The device seems to belong to an earlier
7978,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"civilisation, whether it survived in sixth century Athens or not. It is,"
7979,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"of course, notorious that tribes and clans are most flourishing among"
7980,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"the most backward people, though they were welded into the constitution"
7981,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"of Athens. The passage, therefore, cannot with any certainty be"
7982,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"dismissed as very late, for the words for ""tribe"" and ""clan"" could"
7983,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"not be novel Athenian inventions, the institutions designated being of"
7984,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,prehistoric origin.
7985,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,
7986,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"Nestor shows his tactics again in IV. 303-309, offers his ""inopportune"
7987,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"tactical lucubrations, doubtless under Athenian (Pisistratean)"
7988,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"influence."" The poet is here denied a sense of humour. That a veteran"
7989,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,military Polonius should talk as inopportunely about tactics as Dugald
7990,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,Dalgetty does about the sconce of Drumsnab is an essential part of the
7991,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,humour of the character of Nestor. This is what Nestor's critics do
7992,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,not see; the inopportune nature of his tactical remarks is the point
7993,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"of them, just as in the case of the laird of Drumthwacket, ""that should"
7994,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"be."" Scott knew little of Homer, but coincided in the Nestorian humour"
7995,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,by mere congruity of genius. The Pisistratidze must have been humourless
7996,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,if they did not see that the poet smiled as he composed Nestor's
7997,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"speeches, glorifying old deeds of his own and old ways of fighting. He"
7998,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"arrays his Pylians with chariots in front, footmen in the rear. In the"
7999,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"[blank space] the princely heroes dismounted to fight, the chariots"
8000,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"following close behind them. [Footnote: _Iliad_, XI. 48-56.] In the same"
8001,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,way during the Hundred Years' War the English knights dismounted and
8002,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"defeated the French chivalry till, under Jeanne d'Arc and La Hire, the"
8003,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"French learned the lesson, and imitated the English practice. On"
8004,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"the other hand, Egyptian wall-paintings show the Egyptian chariotry"
8005,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,advancing in neat lines and serried squadrons. According to Nestor
8006,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"these had of old been the Achaean tactics, and he preferred the old way."
8007,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,Nestor's advice in Book IV. is _not_ to dismount or break the line of
8008,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"chariots; these, he says, were the old tactics: ""Even so is the far"
8009,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"better way; thus, moreover, did men of old time lay low cities and"
8010,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"walls."" There was to be no rushing of individuals from the ranks, no"
8011,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,dismounting. Nestor's were not the tactics of the heroes--they usually
8012,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"dismount and do single valiances; but Nestor, commanding his local"
8013,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"contingent, recommends the methods of the old school, [Greek: hoi"
8014,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,pretoroi]. What can be more natural and characteristic?
8015,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,
8016,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"The poet's meaning seems quite clear. He is not flattering Pisistratus,"
8017,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"but, with quiet humour, offers the portrait of a vain, worthy veteran."
8018,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,It is difficult to see how this point can be missed; it never was missed
8019,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,before Nestor's speeches seemed serviceable to the Pisistratean theory
8020,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,of the composition of the _ILIAD_. In his first edition Mr. Leaf
8021,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"regarded the interpolations as intended ""to glorify Nestor"" without"
8022,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"reference to Pisistratus, whom Mr. Leaf did not then recognise as the"
8023,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,master of a sycophantic editor. The passages are really meant to display
8024,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,the old man's habit of glorifying himself and past times. Pisistratus
8025,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,could not feel flattered by passages intended to exhibit his ancestor as
8026,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,a conceited and inopportune old babbler. I ventured in 1896 to suggest
8027,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"that the interpolator was trying to please Pisistratus, but this was"
8028,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,said in a spirit of mockery.
8029,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,
8030,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,Of all the characters in Homer that of Nestor is most familiar to the
8031,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"unlearned world, merely because Nestor's is a ""character part,"" very"
8032,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,broadly drawn.
8033,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,
8034,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,The third interpolation of flattery to Pisistratus in the person of
8035,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,Nestor is found in VII. 125-160. The Achaean chiefs are loath to accept
8036,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,the challenge of Hector to single combat. Only Menelaus rises and arms
8037,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"himself, moved by the strong sense of honour which distinguishes a"
8038,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,warrior notoriously deficient in bodily strength. Agamemnon refuses
8039,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"to let him fight; the other peers make no movement, and Nestor rebukes"
8040,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,them. It is entirely in nature that he should fall back on his memory
8041,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"of a similar situation in his youth; when the Arcadian champion,"
8042,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"Ereuthalion, challenged any prince of the Pylians, and when ""no man"
8043,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"plucked up heart"" to meet him except Nestor himself. Had there never"
8044,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"been any Pisistratus, any poet who created the part of a worthy and"
8045,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,wordy veteran must have made Nestor speak just as he does speak.
8046,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"Ereuthalion ""was the tallest and strongest of men that I have slain!"""
8047,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"and Nestor, being what he is, offers copious and interesting details"
8048,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,about the armour of Ereuthalion and about its former owners. The passage
8049,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,is like those in which the Icelandic sagamen dwelt lovingly on the
8050,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"history of a good sword, or the Maoris on the old possessors of an"
8051,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,ancient jade _patu_. An objection is now taken to Nestor's geography: he
8052,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,is said not to know the towns and burns of his own country. He speaks
8053,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"of the swift stream Keladon, the streams of Iardanus, and the walls of"
8054,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"Pheia. Pheia ""is no doubt the same as Pheai"" [Footnote: Monro, Note on"
8055,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"Odyssey, XV. 297.] (Odyssey, XV. 297), ""but that was a maritime town not"
8056,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,near Arkadia. There is nothing known of a Keladon or Iardanus anywhere
8057,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"near it."" Now Didymus (Schol. A) ""is said to have read [Greek: Phaeraes]"
8058,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"for [Greek: Pheias],"" following Pherekydes. [Footnote: Leaf, _Iliad_,"
8059,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"vol. i. 308.] M. Victor Bérard, who has made an elaborate study of Elian"
8060,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"topography, says that ""Pheia is a cape, not a town,"" and adopts the"
8061,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"reading ""Phera,"" the [Greek: Pherae] of the journey of Telemachus,"
8062,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,in the Odyssey. He thinks that the [Greek: Pherae] of Nestor is the
8063,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"Aliphera of Polybius, and believes that the topography of Nestor and of"
8064,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,the journey of Telemachus is correct. The Keladon is now the river or
8065,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,burn of Saint Isidore; the Iardanus is at the foot of Mount Kaiapha.
8066,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"Keladon has obviously the same sense as the Gaelic Altgarbh, ""the rough"
8067,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"and brawling stream."" Iardanus is also a stream in Crete, and Mr. Leaf"
8068,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"thinks it Semitic--""_Yarden_, from yarad to flow""; but the Semites did"
8069,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,not give the _Yar_ to the _Yarrow_ nor to the Australian _Yarra Yarra_.
8070,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,
8071,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"The country, says M. Bérard, is a network of rivers, burns, and"
8072,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"rivulets; and we cannot have any certainty, we may add, as the same"
8073,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,river and burn names recur in many parts of the same country; [Footnote:
8074,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"Bérard, _Les Phéniciens et L'Odyssée,_ 108-113, 1902] many of them, in"
8075,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"England, are plainly prae-Celtic."
8076,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,
8077,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"While the correct geography may, on this showing, be that of Homer, we"
8078,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,cannot give up Homer's claim to Nestor's speech. As to Nestor's tale
8079,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"about the armour of Ereuthalion, it is manifest that the first owner of"
8080,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"the armour of Ereuthalion, namely Are'ithous, ""the Maceman,"" so called"
8081,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"because he had the singularity of fighting with an iron _casse-tête,_"
8082,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"as Nestor explains (VII. 138-140), was a famous character in legendary"
8083,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"history. He appears ""as Prince Areithous, the Maceman,"" father (or"
8084,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"grand-father?) of an Areithous slain by Hector (VII. 8-10). In Greece,"
8085,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"it was not unusual for the grandson to bear the grandfather's name,"
8086,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"and, if the Maceman was grand-father of Hector's victim, there is no"
8087,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"chronological difficulty. The chronological difficulty, in any case, if"
8088,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"Hector's victim is the son of the Maceman, is not at all beyond a poetic"
8089,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,narrator's possibility of error in genealogy. If Nestor's speech is a
8090,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"late interpolation, if its late author borrowed his vivid account of the"
8091,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"Maceman and his _casse-tête_ from the mere word ""maceman"" in VII. 9, he"
8092,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,must be credited with a lively poetic imagination.
8093,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,
8094,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"Few or none of these reminiscences of Nestor are really ""inapplicable to"
8095,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"the context."" Here the context demands encouragement for heroes who shun"
8096,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"a challenge. Nestor mentions an ""applicable"" and apposite instance of"
8097,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"similar want of courage, and, as his character demands, he is the hero"
8098,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"of his own story. His brag, or _gabe,_ about ""he was the tallest and"
8099,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"strongest of all the men I ever slew,"" is deliciously in keeping, and"
8100,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"reminds us of the college don who said of the Czar, ""he is the nicest"
8101,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"emperor I ever met."" The poet is sketching an innocent vanity; he is not"
8102,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,flattering Pisistratus.
8103,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,
8104,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"The next case is the long narrative of Nestor to the hurried Patroclus,"
8105,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,who has been sent by Achilles to bring news of the wounded Machaon (XI.
8106,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"604-702). Nestor on this occasion has useful advice to give, namely,"
8107,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"that Achilles, if he will not fight, should send his men, under"
8108,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"Patroclus, to turn the tide of Trojan victory. But the poet wishes to"
8109,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,provide an interval of time and of yet more dire disaster before the
8110,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,return of Patroclus to Achilles. By an obvious literary artifice he
8111,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,makes Nestor detain the reluctant Patroclus with a long story of his own
8112,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"early feats of arms. It is a story of a ""hot-trod,"" so called in Border"
8113,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"law; the Eleians had driven a _creagh_ of cattle from the Pylians, who"
8114,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"pursued, and Nestor killed the Eleian leader, Itymoneus. The speech is"
8115,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"an Achaean parallel to the Border ballad of ""Jamie Telfer of the Fair"
8116,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"Dodhead,"" in editing which Scott has been accused of making a singular"
8117,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,and most obvious and puzzling blunder in the topography of his own
8118,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,sheriffdom of the Forest. On Scott's showing the scene of the raid is in
8119,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"upper Ettrickdale, not, as critics aver, in upper Teviotdale; thus the"
8120,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,narrative of the ballad would be impossible. [Footnote: In fact both
8121,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,sites on the two Dodburns are impossible; the fault lay with the
8122,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"ballad-maker, not with Scott.]"
8123,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,
8124,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"The Pisistratean editor is accused of a similar error. ""No doubt he was"
8125,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"an Asiatic Greek, completely ignorant of the Peloponnesus."" [Footnote:"
8126,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"_Iliad_. Note to XI. 756, and to the _Catalogue_, II. 615-617.] It"
8127,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"is something to know that Pisistratus employed an editor, or that his"
8128,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,editor employed a collaborator who was an Asiatic Greek!
8129,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,
8130,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"Meanwhile, nothing is less secure than arguments based on the"
8131,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,_Catalogue_. We have already shown how Mr. Leaf's opinions as to the
8132,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"date and historical merits of the _Catalogue_ have widely varied, while"
8133,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,M. Bérard appears to have vindicated the topography of Nestor. Of the
8134,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"_Catalogue_ Mr. Allen writes, ""As a table, according to regions, of"
8135,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"Agamemnon's forces it bears every mark of venerable antiquity,"" showing"
8136,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"""a state of things which never recurred in later history, and which no"
8137,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"one had any interest to invent, or even the means for inventing."" He"
8138,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"makes a vigorous defence of the _Catalogue,_ as regards the dominion of"
8139,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"Achilles, against Mr. Leaf. [Footnote: _Classical Review,_ May 1906, pp."
8140,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"x94-201.] Into the details we need not go, but it is not questions of"
8141,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"Homeric topography, obscure as they are, that can shake our faith in the"
8142,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"humorous portrait of old Nestor, or make us suppose that the sympathetic"
8143,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,mockery of the poet is the sycophantic adulation of the editor to his
8144,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,"statesman employer, Pisistratus. If any question may be left to literary"
8145,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,discrimination it is the authentic originality of the portrayal of
8146,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,Nestor.

8181,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"society of this kind has had its ruling military class, its ancient"
8182,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"legends, and its minstrels who on these legends have based their songs."
8183,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,The similarity of human nature under similar conditions makes it certain
8184,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,that comparison will discover useful parallels between the poetry of
8185,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,societies separated in time and space but practically identical in
8186,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,culture. It is not much to the credit of modern criticism that a topic
8187,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"so rich and interesting has been, at least in England, almost entirely"
8188,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,neglected by Homeric scholars.
8189,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,
8190,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"Meanwhile, it is perfectly correct to say, as Sir Richard observes, that"
8191,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"""we fail to find any true parallel to the case of the Homeric poems,"""
8192,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,for we nowhere find the legends of an heroic age handled by a very great
8193,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,poet--the greatest of all poets--except in the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_.
8194,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"But, on the other hand, the critics refuse to believe that, in the"
8195,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"_Iliad_ and _Odyssey,_ we possess the heroic Achaean legends handled by"
8196,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"one great poet. They find a composite by many hands, good and bad, and"
8197,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"of many ages, they say; sometimes the whole composition and part of the"
8198,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,poems are ascribed to a late _littérateur_. Now to that supposed state
8199,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"of things we do find several ""true parallels,"" in Germany, in Finland,"
8200,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,in Ireland. But the results of work by these many hands in many ages are
8201,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"anything but ""a true parallel"" to the results which lie before us in"
8202,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,the _Iliad_ and _ODYSSEY_. Where the processes of composite authorship
8203,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"throughout many _AGES_ certainly occur, as in Germany and Ireland, there"
8204,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"we find no true parallel to the Homeric poems. It follows that, in all"
8205,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"probability, no such processes as the critics postulate produced the"
8206,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"_Iliad_ and Odyssey, for where the processes existed, beyond doubt they"
8207,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,failed egregiously to produce the results.
8208,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,
8209,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,Sir Richard's argument would have been logical if many efforts by many
8210,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"hands, in many ages, in England, Finland, Ireland, Iceland, and Germany"
8211,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"did actually produce true parallels to the Achaean epics. They did not,"
8212,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,and why not? Simply because these other races had no Homer. All the
8213,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"other necessary conditions were present, the legendary material, the"
8214,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"heroic society, the Court minstrels, all--except the great poet. In"
8215,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"all the countries mentioned, except Finland, there existed military"
8216,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"aristocracies with their courts, castles, and minstrels, while the"
8217,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"minstrels had rich material in legendary history and in myth, and"
8218,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"_Märchen_, and old songs. But none of the minstrels was adequate to the"
8219,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"production of an English, German, or Irish _ILIAD_ or _ODYSSEY_, or even"
8220,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,of a true artistic equivalent in France.
8221,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,
8222,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"We have tried to show that the critics, rejecting a Homer, have been"
8223,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,unable to advance any adequate hypothesis to account for the existence
8224,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"of the _ILIAD_ and _ODYSSEY_. Now we see that, where such conditions of"
8225,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,production as they postulate existed but where there was no great epic
8226,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"genius, they can find no true parallels to the Epics. Their logic thus"
8227,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,breaks down at both ends.
8228,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,
8229,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,It may be replied that in non-Greek lands one condition found in Greek
8230,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,society failed: the succession of a reading age to an age of heroic
8231,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,listeners. But this is not so. In France and Germany an age of readers
8232,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"duly began, but they did not mainly read copies of the old heroic poems."
8233,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"They turned to lyric poetry, as in Greece, and they recast the heroic"
8234,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"songs into modern and popular forms in verse and prose, when they took"
8235,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,any notice of the old heroic poems at all.
8236,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,
8237,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"One merit of the Greek epics is a picture of ""a certain phase of early"
8238,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"civilisation,"" and that picture is ""a naturally harmonious whole,"" with"
8239,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"""unity of impression,"" says Sir Richard Jebb. [Footnote: Homer, p. 37.]"
8240,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"Certainly we can find no true parallel, on an Homeric scale, to this"
8241,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"""harmonious picture"" in the epics of Germany and England or in the"
8242,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"early literature of Ireland. Sir Richard, for England, omits notice of"
8243,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"_Beowulf_; but we know that _Beowulf_, a long heroic poem, is a mass of"
8244,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"anachronisms--a heathen legend in a Christian setting. The hero, that"
8245,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"great heathen champion, has his epic filled full of Christian allusions"
8246,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"and Christian morals, because the clerical redactor, in Christian"
8247,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"England, could not but intrude these things into old pagan legends"
8248,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"evolved by the continental ancestors of our race. He had no ""painful"
8249,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"anxiety,"" like the supposed Ionic continuators of the Achaean poems"
8250,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"(when they are not said to have done precisely the reverse), to preserve"
8251,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,harmony of ancient ideas. Such archaeological anxieties are purely
8252,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,modern.
8253,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,
8254,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"If we take the _Nibelungenlied_, [Footnote: See chapter on the"
8255,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"_Nibelungenlied_ in Homer _AND the Epic_, pp. 382-404.] we find that"
8256,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"it is a thing of many rehandlings, even in existing manuscripts. For"
8257,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"example, the Greeks clung to the hexameter in Homer. Not so did the"
8258,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"Germans adhere to old metres. The poem that, in the oldest MS., is"
8259,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"written in assonances, in later MSS. is reduced to regular rhymes and is"
8260,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,retouched in many essential respects. The matter of the _Nibelungenlied_
8261,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,is of heathen origin. We see the real state of heathen affairs in the
8262,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"Icelandic versions of the same tale, for the Icelanders were peculiar in"
8263,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"preserving ancient lays; and, when these were woven into a prose saga,"
8264,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,the archaic and heathen features were retained. Had the post-Christian
8265,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"prose author of the _Volsunga_ been a great poet, we might find in"
8266,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"his work a true parallel to the _Iliad_. But, though he preserves the"
8267,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,harmony of his picture of pre-Christian princely life (save in the
8268,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"savage beginnings of his story), he is not a poet; so the true parallel"
8269,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"to the Greek epic fails, noble as is the saga in many passages. In the"
8270,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"German _Nibelungenlied_ all is modernised; the characters are Christian,"
8271,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"the manners are chivalrous, and _Märchen_ older than Homer are forced"
8272,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"into a wandering mediaeval chronicle-poem. The Germans, in short, had no"
8273,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"early poet of genius, and therefore could not produce a true parallel"
8274,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"to _ILIAD_ or Odyssey. The mediaeval poets, of course, never dreamed"
8275,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"of archaeological anxiety, as the supposed Ionian continuators are"
8276,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"sometimes said to have done, any more than did the French and late Welsh"
8277,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,handlers of the ancient Celtic Arthurian materials. The late
8278,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,German _bearbeiter_ of the _Nibelungenlied_ has no idea of unity of
8279,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"plot--_enfin_, Germany, having excellent and ancient legendary material"
8280,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"for an epic, but producing no parallel to _ILIAD_ and Odyssey, only"
8281,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,proves how absolutely essential a Homer was to the Greek epics.
8282,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,
8283,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"""If any inference could properly be drawn from the Edda"" (the Icelandic"
8284,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"collection of heroic lays), says Sir Richard Jebb, ""it would be that"
8285,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,short separate poems on cognate subjects can long exist as a collection
8286,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,_without_ coalescing into such an artistic whole as the Iliad or the
8287,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"Odyssey."" [Footnote: Homer, p. 33.]"
8288,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,
8289,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"It is our own argument that Sir Richard states. ""Short separate poems"
8290,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"on cognate subjects"" can certainly co-exist for long anywhere, but they"
8291,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,cannot automatically and they cannot by aid of an editor become a long
8292,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,epic. Nobody can stitch and vamp them into a poem like the _ILIAD_ or
8293,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,Odyssey. To produce a poem like either of these a great poetic genius
8294,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"must arise, and fuse the ancient materials, as Hephaestus fused copper"
8295,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"and tin, and then cast the mass into a mould of his own making. A small"
8296,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"poet may reduce the legends and lays into a very inartistic whole, a"
8297,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"very inharmonious whole, as in the _Nibelungenlied_, but a controlling"
8298,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"poet, not a mere redactor or editor, is needed to perform even that"
8299,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,feat.
8300,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,
8301,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"Where a man who is not a poet undertakes to produce the coalescence,"
8302,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"as Dr. Lönnrot (1835-1849) did in the case of the peasant, not courtly,"
8303,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"lays of Finland, he ""fails to prove that mere combining and editing can"
8304,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"form an artistic whole out of originally distinct songs, even though"
8305,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"concerned with closely related themes,"" says Sir Richard Jebb."
8306,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"[Footnote: Homer, p. 134-135.]"
8307,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,
8308,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,This is perfectly true; much as Lönnrot botched and vamped the Finnish
8309,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"lays he made no epic out of them. But, as it is true, how did the late"
8310,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"Athenian drudge of Pisistratus succeed where Lönnrot failed? ""In the"
8311,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"dovetailing of the _ODYSSEY_ we see the work of one mind,"" says Sir"
8312,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"Richard. [Footnote: Homer, p. 129.] This mind cannot have been the"
8313,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"property of any one but a great poet, obviously, as the _Odyssey_ is"
8314,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"confessedly ""an artistic whole."" Consequently the disintegrators of the"
8315,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"Odyssey, when they are logical, are reduced to averring that the poem is"
8316,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"an exceedingly inartistic whole, a whole not artistic at all. While Mr."
8317,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"Leaf calls it ""a model of skilful construction,"" Wilamowitz Mollendorff"
8318,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"denounces it as the work of ""a slenderly-gifted botcher,"" of about 650"
8319,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"B.C., a century previous to Mr. Leaf's Athenian editor."
8320,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,
8321,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"Thus we come, after all, to a crisis in which mere literary appreciation"
8322,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,is the only test of the truth about a work of literature. The Odyssey is
8323,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"an admirable piece of artistic composition, or it is the very reverse."
8324,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"Blass, Mr. Leaf, Sir Richard Jebb, and the opinion of the ages declare"
8325,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,that the composition is excellent. A crowd of German critics and Father
8326,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"Browne, S.J., hold that the composition is feeble. The criterion is the"
8327,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,literary taste of each party to the dispute. Kirchhoff and Wilamowitz
8328,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"Möllendorff see a late bad patchwork, where Mr. Leaf, Sir Richard"
8329,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"Jebb, Blass, Wolf, and the verdict of all mankind see a masterpiece of"
8330,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,excellent construction. The world has judged: the _Odyssey_ is a
8331,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,marvel of construction: therefore is not the work of a late botcher of
8332,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"disparate materials, but of a great early poet. Yet Sir Richard Jebb,"
8333,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"while recognising the _Odyssey_ as ""an artistic whole"" and an harmonious"
8334,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"picture, and recognising Lönnrot's failure ""to prove that mere combining"
8335,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,and editing can form an artistic whole out of originally distinct
8336,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"songs, even though concerned with closely related themes,"" thinks that"
8337,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,Kirchhoff has made the essence of his theory of late combination of
8338,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"distinct strata of poetical material from different sources and periods,"
8339,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"in the _Odyssey_, ""in the highest degree probable."" [Footnote: Homer, p."

8341,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,
8342,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"It is, of course, possible that Mr. Leaf, who has not edited the"
8343,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"_Odyssey,_ may now, in deference to his belief in the Pisistratean"
8344,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"editor, have changed his opinion of the merits of the poem. If the"
8345,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"_Odyssey,_ like the _Iliad_, was, till about 540 B.C., a chaos of"
8346,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"lays of all ages, variously known in various _répertoires_ of the"
8347,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"rhapsodists, and patched up by the Pisistratean editor, then of two"
8348,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,things one--either Mr. Leaf abides by his enthusiastic belief in the
8349,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"excellency of the composition, or he does not. If he does still believe"
8350,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"that the composition of the _Odyssey_ is a masterpiece, then the"
8351,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"Pisistratean editor was a great master of construction. If he now, on"
8352,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"the other hand, agrees with Wilamowitz Möllendorff that the _Odyssey_ is"
8353,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,"cobbler's work, then his literary opinions are unstable."

8420,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"presenting one assonance, not rhyme. As time went on, rhyme and"

8460,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"Jendeus lived on his poem by reciting it, and left it to his son when he"
8461,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,died. The story of Homer and Stasinus could only have been invented in
8462,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,an age when the possession of the solitary text of a poem was a source
8463,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"of maintenance to the poet. This condition of things could not exist,"
8464,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,either when there were no written texts or when such texts were
8465,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,multiplied to serve the wants of a reading public.
8466,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,
8467,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"Again, a poet in the fortunate position of Jendeus would not teach his"

8488,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"in spite of all temptations to permit the copying of his MS., is"
8489,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,regarded by Sir Richard Jebb as quite a possible feature of early
8490,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"Greece. He thinks that there was ""no wide circulation of writings"
8491,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"by numerous copies for a reading public"" before the end of the fifth"
8492,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"century B.C. As Greek mercenaries could write, and write well, in the"
8493,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"seventh to sixth centuries, I incline to think that there may then, and"
8494,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"earlier, have been a reading public. However, long before that a man"
8495,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"might commit his poems to writing. ""Wolf allows that some men did, as"

8503,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"which is corroborated by the story of the _Cypria_, given as a dowry"

8506,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"in every respect, with surprising closeness, in the France of the"
8507,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,eleventh to thirteenth centuries. The social conditions are the same;
8508,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,the legendary materials are of identical character; the method of
8509,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,publication by recitation is identical; the cyclic decadence occurs in
8510,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"both cases, the _monomanie cyclique_. In the Greece of Homer we have the"
8511,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"four necessary conditions of the epic, as found by M. Léon Gautier in"
8512,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,mediaeval France. We have:--

8536,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,epics are closely parallel; they only differ in the exquisite art of
8537,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"Homer, to which no approach is made by the French poets."
8538,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,
8539,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"The French authors of epic, even more than Homer, abound in episodes"
8540,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"much more distracting than those of the _Iliad_. Of blood and wounds, of"
8541,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"course, both the French and the Greek are profuse: they were writing for"
8542,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"men of the sword, not for modern critics. Indeed, the battle pieces of"
8543,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"France almost translate those of Homer. The Achaean ""does on his goodly"

8555,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"were at strife."" [Footnote: Odyssey, VIII. 75-7s [sic].]"
8556,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,
8557,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"Of all the many parallels between the Greek and French epics, the most"
8558,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,extraordinary is the coincidence between Charles with his peers and
8559,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"Agamemnon with his princes. The same historical conditions occurred, at"
8560,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"an interval of more than two thousand years. Agamemnon is the Bretwalda,"
8561,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"the Over-Lord, as Mr. Freeman used to say, of the Achaeans: he is the"
8562,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"suzerain. Charles in the French epics holds the same position, but the"
8563,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"French poets regard him in different lights. In the earliest epic, the"
8564,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"_Chanson_ de Roland, a divinity doth hedge the famous Emperor, whom"
8565,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"Jeanne d'Arc styled ""St. Charlemagne."" He was, in fact, a man of"
8566,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"thirty-seven at the date of the disaster of Roncesvaux, where Roland"
8567,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,fell (778 A.D.). But in the tradition that has reached the poet of the
8568,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"_chanson_ he is a white-bearded warrior, as vigorous as he is venerable."
8569,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"As he rules by advice of his council, he bids them deliberate on the"
8570,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"proposals of the Paynim King, Marsile--to accept or refuse them. Roland,"
8571,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"the counterpart of Achilles in all respects (Oliver is his Patroclus),"
8572,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,is for refusing: Ganelon appears to have the rest with him when he
8573,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"speaks in favour of peace and return to France out of Spain. So, in"
8574,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"the _Iliad_ (II.), the Achaeans lend a ready ear to Agamemnon when he"
8575,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"proposes the abandonment of the siege of Troy. Each host, French and"
8576,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"Achaean, is heartily homesick."
8577,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,
8578,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"Ganelon's advice prevailing, it is necessary to send an envoy to the"
8579,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,Saracen court. It is a dangerous mission; other envoys have been sent
8580,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"and been murdered. The Peers, however, volunteer, beginning with the"
8581,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"aged Naismes, the Nestor of the Franks. His offer is not accepted,"
8582,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"nor are those of Oliver, Roland, and Turpin. Roland then proposes that"
8583,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"Ganelon shall be sent; and hence arises the Wrath of Ganelon, which was"
8584,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,the ruin of Roland and the peers who stood by him. The warriors attack
8585,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"each other in speeches of Homeric fury. Charles preserves his dignity,"
8586,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"and Ganelon departs on his mission. He deliberately sells himself,"
8587,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,and seals the fate of the peers whom he detests: the surprise of the
8588,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"rearguard under Roland, the deadly battle, and the revenge of Charles"
8589,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,make up the rest of the poem. Not even in victory is Charles allowed
8590,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,repose; the trumpet again summons him to war. He is of those whom Heaven
8591,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,has called to endless combat--
8592,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,
8593,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"""Their whole lives long to be winding"

8597,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,
8598,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,Such is the picture of the imperial Charles in one of the oldest of the
8599,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"French epics. The heart of the poet is with the aged, but unbroken and"
8600,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"truly imperial, figure of St. Charlemagne--wise, just, and brave, a true"

8605,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"the feudal princes began the long struggle against the French king, the"
8606,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,poets gratified their patrons by degrading the character of the Emperor.
8607,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"They created a second type of Charles, and it is the second type that on"
8608,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,the whole most resembles the Agamemnon of the _Iliad._
8609,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,
8610,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,We ask why the widely ruling lord of golden Mycenae is so skilfully
8611,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"and persistently represented as respectable, indeed, by reason of his"
8612,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"office, but detestable, on the whole, in character?"
8613,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,
8614,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,The answer is that just as the second type of Charles is the result of
8615,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"feudal jealousies of the king, so the character of Agamemnon reflects"
8616,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,the princely hatreds of what we may call the feudal age of Greece. The
8617,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,masterly portrait of Agamemnon could only have been designed to win
8618,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"the sympathies of feudal listeners, princes with an Over-Lord whom they"
8619,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"cannot repudiate, for whose office they have a traditional reverence,"
8620,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"but whose power they submit to with no good will, and whose person and"
8621,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,character some of them can barely tolerate.

8624,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"what may be called a feudal society, and the attitudes of the Achaean"
8625,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"Bretwalda and of his peers are, from beginning to end of the _Iliad_ and"
8626,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"in every Book of it, those of the peers and king in the later _Chansons"

8628,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,
8629,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"Returning to the decadent Charles of the French epics, we lay no stress"
8630,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"on the story of his incest with his sister, Gilain, ""whence sprang"
8631,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"Roland."" The House of Thyestes, whence Agamemnon sprang, is marked by"

8633,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"about the King Arthur, who in romance is so much inferior to his"
8634,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"knights, a reflection of feudal jealousies and hatreds. In places the"
8635,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,reproaches hurled by the peers at Charles read like paraphrases of those
8636,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"which the Achaean princes cast at Agamemnon. Even Naismes, the Nestor of"
8637,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"the French epics, cries: ""It is for you that we have left our lands and"

8639,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"they pray in Rome, were it not that we should be guilty before God we"

8643,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"angered Achilles: ""We came not hither in our own quarrel, thou shameless"
8644,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"one, but to please thee! But now go I back to Phthia with my ships--the"

8647,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"Agamemnon answers that Zeus is on his side, just as even the angry"
8648,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,Naismes admits that duty to God demands obedience to Charles. There
8649,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"cannot be parallels more close and true than these, between poems born"
8650,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"at a distance from each other of more than two thousand years, but born"
8651,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,in similar historical conditions.

8661,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"camps by the wine. Charles, in the _Chanson de Saisnes_, abases himself"
8662,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"before Herapois, even more abjectly than Agamemnon in his offer of"
8663,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"atonement to Achilles. [Footnote: _Épopées Françaises_, Léon Gautier,"
8664,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,vol. iii. p. 158.] Charles is as arrogant as Agamemnon: he strikes
8665,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"Roland with his glove, for an uncommanded victory, and then he loses"
8666,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,heart and weeps as copiously as the penitent Agamemnon often does when
8667,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,he rues his arrogance. [Footnote: _Entrée en Espagne_.]
8668,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,
8669,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,The poet of the _Iliad_ is a great and sober artist. He does not make
8670,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,Agamemnon endure the lowest disgraces which the latest French epic poets
8671,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,heap on Charles. But we see how close is the parallel between Agamemnon
8672,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,and the Charles of the decadent type. Both characters are reflections of
8673,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,feudal jealousy of the Over-Lord; both reflect real antique historical
8674,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"conditions, and these were the conditions of the Achaeans in Europe, not"
8675,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,of the Ionians in Asia.
8676,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,
8677,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,The treatment of Agamemnon's character is harmonious throughout. It
8678,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"is not as if in ""the original poem"" Agamemnon were revered like St."
8679,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"Charlemagne in the _Chanson de Roland_, and in the ""later"" parts of the"
8680,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,_Iliad_ were reduced to the contemptible estate of the Charles of the
8681,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,decadent _Chanson de Geste_. In the _Iliad_ Agamemnon's character is
8682,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"consistently presented from beginning to end, presented, I think, as it"
8683,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,could only be by a great poet of the feudal Achaean society in Europe.
8684,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"The Ionians--""democratic to the core,"" says Mr. Leaf--would either have"

8692,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"French and Achaean, are also true parallels, except in genius. The"
8693,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,French have no Homer: _cared vate sacro_. It follows that a Homer was
8694,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,necessary to the evolution of the Greek epics.
8695,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,
8696,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"It may, perhaps, be replied to this argument that our _Iliad_ is only"
8697,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"a very late _remaniement_, like the fourteenth century _Chansons de"
8698,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"Geste_, of something much earlier and nobler. But in France, in the age"
8699,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"of _remaniement_, even the versification had changed from assonance to"
8700,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"rhyme, from the decasyllabic line to the Alexandrine in the decadence,"
8701,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,while a plentiful lack of seriousness and a love of purely fanciful
8702,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,adventures in fairyland take the place of the austere spirit of war.
8703,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"Ladies ""in a coming on humour"" abound, and Charles is involved with his"
8704,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,Paladins in _gauloiseries_ of a Rabelaisian cast. The French language
8705,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"has become a new thing through and through, and manners and weapons are"
8706,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,of a new sort; but the high seriousness of the _Iliad_ is maintained
8707,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"throughout, except in the burlesque battle of the gods: the"
8708,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"versification is the stately hexameter, linguistic alterations are"
8709,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"present, extant, but inconspicuous. That the armour and weapons are"
8710,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"uniform in character throughout we have tried to prove, while the state"
8711,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,of society and of religion is certainly throughout harmonious. Our
8712,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"parallel, then, between the French and the Greek national epics appears"
8713,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"as perfect as such a thing can be, surprisingly perfect, while the great"
8714,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,point of difference in degree of art is accounted for by the existence
8715,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,"of an Achaean poet of supreme genius. Not such, certainly, were the"

8727,CONCLUSION,"The conclusion at which we arrive is that the _Iliad_, as a whole, is"
8728,CONCLUSION,the work of one age. That it has reached us without interpolations and
8729,CONCLUSION,_lacunae_ and _remaniements_ perhaps no person of ordinary sense will
8730,CONCLUSION,allege. But that the mass of the Epic is of one age appears to be a
8731,CONCLUSION,natural inference from the breakdown of the hypotheses which attempt to
8732,CONCLUSION,"explain it as a late mosaic. We have also endeavoured to prove, quite"
8733,CONCLUSION,"apart from the failure of theories of expansion and compilation, that"
8734,CONCLUSION,"the _Iliad_ presents an historical unity, unity of character, unity of"
8735,CONCLUSION,"customary law, and unity in its archaeology. If we are right, we must"
8736,CONCLUSION,have an opinion as to how the Epic was preserved.
8737,CONCLUSION,
8738,CONCLUSION,"If we had evidence for an Homeric school, we might imagine that the Epic"
8739,CONCLUSION,"was composed by dint of memory, and preserved, like the Sanskrit Hymns"
8740,CONCLUSION,"of the Rig Veda, and the Hymns of the Maoris, the Zuñis, and other"
8741,CONCLUSION,"peoples in the lower or middle stage of barbarism, by the exertions and"
8742,CONCLUSION,teaching of schools. But religious hymns and mythical hymns--the care
8743,CONCLUSION,of a priesthood--are one thing; a great secular epic is another. Priests
8744,CONCLUSION,will not devote themselves from age to age to its conservation. It
8745,CONCLUSION,"cannot be conserved, with its unity of tone and character, and, on the"
8746,CONCLUSION,"whole, even of language, by generations of paid strollers, who recite"
8747,CONCLUSION,"new lays of their own, as well as any old lays that they may remember,"
8748,CONCLUSION,which they alter at pleasure.
8749,CONCLUSION,
8750,CONCLUSION,"We are thus driven back to the theory of early written texts, not"
8751,CONCLUSION,"intended to meet the wants of a reading public, but for the use of the"
8752,CONCLUSION,poet himself and of those to whom he may bequeath his work. That this
8753,CONCLUSION,has been a method in which orally published epics were composed and
8754,CONCLUSION,preserved in a non-reading age we have proved in our chapter on the
8755,CONCLUSION,"French Chansons _de Geste_. Unhappily, the argument that what was done"
8756,CONCLUSION,"in mediaeval France might be done in sub-Mycenaean Greece, is based"
8757,CONCLUSION,"on probabilities, and these are differently estimated by critics of"
8758,CONCLUSION,different schools. All seems to depend on each individual's sense
8759,CONCLUSION,"of what is ""likely."" In that case science has nothing to make in the"
8760,CONCLUSION,matter. Nitzsche thought that writing might go back to the time of
8761,CONCLUSION,"Homer. Mr. Monro thought it ""probable enough that writing, even if known"
8762,CONCLUSION,"at the time of Homer, was not used for literary purposes."" [Footnote:"
8763,CONCLUSION,"_Iliad_, vol. i. p. xxxv.] Sir Richard Jebb, as we saw, took a much more"
8764,CONCLUSION,favourable view of the probability of early written texts. M. Salomon
8765,CONCLUSION,"Reinach, arguing from the linear written clay tablets of Knossos and"
8766,CONCLUSION,"from a Knossian cup with writing on it in ink, thinks that there"
8767,CONCLUSION,"may have existed whole ""Minoan"" libraries--manuscripts executed on"
8768,CONCLUSION,"perishable materials, palm leaves, papyrus, or parchment. [Footnote:"
8769,CONCLUSION,"_L'Anthropologie_, vol. xv, pp. 292, 293.] Mr. Leaf, while admitting"
8770,CONCLUSION,"that ""writing was known in some form through the whole period of epic"
8771,CONCLUSION,"development,"" holds that ""it is in the highest degree unlikely that it"
8772,CONCLUSION,was ever employed to form a standard text of the Epic or any portion of
8773,CONCLUSION,it.... At best there was a continuous tradition of those portions of the
8774,CONCLUSION,"poems which were especially popular ..."" [Footnote: _Iliad_, vol. i."
8775,CONCLUSION,"pp. xvi., xvii.] Father Browne dates the employment of writing for the"
8776,CONCLUSION,"preservation of the Epic ""from the sixth century onwards."" [Footnote:"
8777,CONCLUSION,"_Handbook of Homeric Study_, p. 134.] He also says that ""it is difficult"
8778,CONCLUSION,"to suppose that the Mycenaeans, who were certainly in contact with this"
8779,CONCLUSION,"form of writing"" (the Cretan linear), ""should not have used it much"
8780,CONCLUSION,"more freely than our direct evidence warrants us in asserting."" He then"
8781,CONCLUSION,"mentions the Knossian cup ""with writing inscribed on it apparently in"
8782,CONCLUSION,"pen and ink ... The conclusion is that ordinary writing was in use, but"
8783,CONCLUSION,"that the materials, probably palm leaves, have disappeared."" [Footnote:"

8785,CONCLUSION,
8786,CONCLUSION,Why it should be unlikely that a people confessedly familiar with
8787,CONCLUSION,"writing used it for the preservation of literature, when we know that"
8788,CONCLUSION,"even the Red Indians preserve their songs by means of pictographs, while"
8789,CONCLUSION,"West African tribes use incised characters, is certainly not obvious."
8790,CONCLUSION,Many sorts of prae-Phoenician writing were current during the Mycenaean
8791,CONCLUSION,"age in Asia, Egypt, Assyria, and in Cyprus. As these other peoples used"
8792,CONCLUSION,"writing of their own sort for literary purposes, it is not easy to"
8793,CONCLUSION,"see why the Cretans, for example, should not have done the same thing."
8794,CONCLUSION,"Indeed, Father Browne supposes that the Mycenaeans used ""ordinary"
8795,CONCLUSION,"writing,"" and used it freely. Nevertheless, the Epic was not written,"
8796,CONCLUSION,"he says, till the sixth century B.C. Cauer, indeed, remarks that ""the"
8797,CONCLUSION,"Finnish epic"" existed unwritten till Lbnnrot, its Pisistratus,"
8798,CONCLUSION,first collected it from oral recitation. [Footnote: _Grundfragen der
8799,CONCLUSION,"Homerkritik_, p. 94.] But there is not, and never was, any ""Finnish"
8800,CONCLUSION,"epic."" There were cosmogonic songs, as among the Maoris and Zuñis--songs"
8801,CONCLUSION,"of the beginnings of things; there were magical songs, songs of"
8802,CONCLUSION,"weddings, a song based on the same popular tale that underlies the"
8803,CONCLUSION,"legend of the Argonauts. There were songs of the Culture Hero, songs of"
8804,CONCLUSION,"burial and feast, and of labour. Lönnrot collected these, and tried by"
8805,CONCLUSION,"interpolations to make an epic out of them; but the point, as Comparetti"
8806,CONCLUSION,"has proved, is that he failed. There is no Finnish epic, only a mass of"
8807,CONCLUSION,"_Volkslieder._ Cauer's other argument, that the German popular tales,"
8808,CONCLUSION,"Grimm's tales, were unwritten till 1812, is as remote from the point at"
8809,CONCLUSION,issue. Nothing can be less like an epic than a volume of _Märchen._
8810,CONCLUSION,
8811,CONCLUSION,As usual we are driven back upon a literary judgment. Is the _Iliad_ a
8812,CONCLUSION,patchwork of metrical _Märchen_ or is it an epic nobly constructed? If
8813,CONCLUSION,"it is the former, writing was not needed; if it is the latter, in the"
8814,CONCLUSION,"absence of Homeric guilds or colleges, only writing can account for its"
8815,CONCLUSION,preservation.
8816,CONCLUSION,
8817,CONCLUSION,It is impossible to argue against a critic's subjective sense of what
8818,CONCLUSION,is likely. Possibly that sense is born of the feeling that the Cretan
8819,CONCLUSION,"linear script, for example, or the Cyprian syllabary, looks very odd"
8820,CONCLUSION,and outlandish. The critic's imagination boggles at the idea of an
8821,CONCLUSION,epic written in such scripts. In that case his is not the scientific
8822,CONCLUSION,imagination; he is checked merely by the unfamiliar. Or his sense of
8823,CONCLUSION,"unlikelihood may be a subconscious survival of Wolf's opinion, formed"
8824,CONCLUSION,by him at a time when the existence of the many scripts of the old world
8825,CONCLUSION,was unknown.
8826,CONCLUSION,
8827,CONCLUSION,"Our own sense of probability leads us to the conclusion that, in an age"
8828,CONCLUSION,"when people could write, people wrote down the Epic. If they applied"
8829,CONCLUSION,"their art to literature, then the preservation of the Epic is explained."
8830,CONCLUSION,"Written first in a prae-Phoenician script, it continued to be written"
8831,CONCLUSION,"in the Greek adaptation of the Phoenician alphabet. There was not yet,"
8832,CONCLUSION,"probably, a reading public, but there were a few clerkly men."
8833,CONCLUSION,
8834,CONCLUSION,"That the Cretans, at least, could write long before the age of Homer,"
8835,CONCLUSION,Mr. Arthur Evans has demonstrated by his discoveries. Prom my remote
8836,CONCLUSION,undergraduate days I was of the opinion which he has proved to be

8855,CONCLUSION,
8856,CONCLUSION,Thus the use of writing for the conservation of the Epic cannot seem
8857,CONCLUSION,"to me to be unlikely, but rather probable; and here one must leave the"
8858,CONCLUSION,"question, as the subjective element plays so great a part in every man's"

8867,CONCLUSION,"_History of Greece_, vol. i. p. 78. 1902.] This may seem an audaciously"
8868,CONCLUSION,"early date, but when we find vases of the eighth to seventh centuries"
8869,CONCLUSION,"bearing inscriptions, we may infer that a knowledge of reading and"
8870,CONCLUSION,writing was reasonably common. When such a humble class of hirelings
8871,CONCLUSION,"or slaves as the pot-painters can sign their work, expecting their"

8874,CONCLUSION,
8875,CONCLUSION,If Mr. Gardner is right in dating a number of incised inscriptions on
8876,CONCLUSION,"early pottery at Naucratis before the middle of the seventh century,"
8877,CONCLUSION,"we reach the same conclusion. In fact, if these inscriptions be of a"
8878,CONCLUSION,"century earlier than the Abu Simbel inscriptions, of date 590 B.C., we"
8879,CONCLUSION,"reach 690 B.C. Wherefore, as writing does not become common in a moment,"

8904,CONCLUSION,"improbable that old jugs were sold at curiosity shops in these days, and"
8905,CONCLUSION,"given by amateurs to artists. The inscription proves that, in the eighth"

9034,CONCLUSION,papyrus fragments of the _Iliad_ display unwarrantable interpolation.
9035,CONCLUSION,"[Footnote: Monro, _Odyssey_, vol. ii. pp. 422-426.] But Plato's frequent"

9077,CONCLUSION,"inconsistencies in the theories of each separatist critic. A theory,"
9078,CONCLUSION,"in such matter as this, is itself an explanatory myth, or the plot of"
9079,CONCLUSION,a story which the critic invents to account for the facts in the case.
9080,CONCLUSION,"These critical plots, we have shown, do not account for the facts of the"
9081,CONCLUSION,"case, for the critics do not excel in constructing plots. They wander"

9085,CONCLUSION,as inconsistent as a modern critic.
9086,CONCLUSION,
9087,CONCLUSION,"Meanwhile, though we have no external evidence that the _Iliad_ was"
9088,CONCLUSION,ever expanded--that it was expanded is an explanatory myth of the
9089,CONCLUSION,"critics--""we do know, on good evidence,"" says Mr. Jevons, ""that the"

9094,CONCLUSION,"and did not take too long to recite."" Mr. Jevons suggests that the many"
9095,CONCLUSION,brief poems collected in the Homeric hymns are invocations which the
9096,CONCLUSION,rhapsodists preluded to their recitals. The practice seems to have been
9097,CONCLUSION,"for the rhapsodist first to pay his reverence to the god, ""to begin from"
9098,CONCLUSION,"the god,"" at whose festival the recitation was being given (the short"

9106,CONCLUSION,"deliver."""
9107,CONCLUSION,
9108,CONCLUSION,"These explanations, at all events, yield good sense. The invocation of"
9109,CONCLUSION,"Athene (Hymns, XI., XXVIII.) would serve as the proem of invocation to"
9110,CONCLUSION,"the recital of _Iliad_, V., VI. 1-311, the day of valour of Diomede,"
9111,CONCLUSION,"spurred on by the wanton rebuke of Agamemnon, and aided by Athene. The"
9112,CONCLUSION,"invocation of Hephaestus (Hymn XX.), would prelude to a recital of the"
9113,CONCLUSION,"_Making of the Awns of Achilles_, and so on."
9114,CONCLUSION,
9115,CONCLUSION,"But the rhapsodist may be reciting at a festival of Dionysus, about whom"
9116,CONCLUSION,there is practically nothing said in the _Iliad_; for it is a proof of
9117,CONCLUSION,"the antiquity of the _Iliad_ that, when it was composed, Dionysus had"
9118,CONCLUSION,"not been raised to the Olympian peerage, being still a folk-god only."
9119,CONCLUSION,"The rhapsodist, at a feast of Dionysus in later times, has to introduce"

9121,CONCLUSION,"him. [Footnote:_Ibid_., VI. 130-141]"
9122,CONCLUSION,
9123,CONCLUSION,Why should any mortal have made this interpolation? Mr. Jevons's theory
9124,CONCLUSION,supplies the answer. The rhapsodist added the passages to suit the
9125,CONCLUSION,"Dionysus feast, at which he was reciting."
9126,CONCLUSION,
9127,CONCLUSION,The same explanation is offered for the long story of the _Birth_
9128,CONCLUSION,of [blank space] which Agamemnon tells in his speech of apology and
9129,CONCLUSION,"reconciliation. [Footnote:_Ibid_., XIX. 136.] There is an invocation to"
9130,CONCLUSION,"Heracles (Hymns, XV.), and the author may have added this speech to his"
9131,CONCLUSION,"rhapsody of the Reconciliation, recited at a feast of Heracles. Perhaps"
9132,CONCLUSION,the remark of Mr. Leaf offers the real explanation of the presence of
9133,CONCLUSION,"this long story in the speech of Agamemnon: ""Many speakers with a bad"
9134,CONCLUSION,"case take refuge in telling stories."" Agamemnon shows, says Mr. Leaf,"
9135,CONCLUSION,"""the peevish nervousness of a man who feels that he has been in the"
9136,CONCLUSION,"wrong,"" and who follows a frank speaker like Achilles, only eager for"
9137,CONCLUSION,Agamemnon to give the word to form and charge. So Agamemnon takes refuge
9138,CONCLUSION,"in a long story, throwing the blame of his conduct on Destiny."
9139,CONCLUSION,
9140,CONCLUSION,"We do not need, then, the theory of a rhapsodist's interpolation, but it"
9141,CONCLUSION,is quite plausible in itself.
9142,CONCLUSION,
9143,CONCLUSION,"Local heroes, as well as gods, had their feasts in post-Homeric times,"
9144,CONCLUSION,"and a reciter at a feast of AEneas, or of his mother, Aphrodite, may"
9145,CONCLUSION,"have foisted in the very futile discourse of Achilles and AEneas,"
9146,CONCLUSION,"[Footnote:_Ibid_., XX. 213-250.] with its reference to Erichthonius, an"
9147,CONCLUSION,Athenian hero.
9148,CONCLUSION,
9149,CONCLUSION,In other cases the rhapsodist rounded off his selected passage by a few
9150,CONCLUSION,"lines, as in _Iliad_, XIII. 656-659, where a hero is brought to follow"
9151,CONCLUSION,"his son's dead body to the grave, though the father had been killed"
9152,CONCLUSION,"in _V. 576_. ""It is really such a slip as is often made by authors who"
9153,CONCLUSION,"write,"" says Mr. Leaf; and, in _Esmond_, Thackeray makes similar"
9154,CONCLUSION,"errors. The passage in XVI. 69-80, about which so much is said, as if it"
9155,CONCLUSION,"contradicted Book IX. (_The Embassy to Achilles_), is also, Mr. Jevons"
9156,CONCLUSION,"thinks, to be explained as ""inserted by a rhapsodist wishing to make"
9157,CONCLUSION,"his extract complete in itself."" Another example--the confusion in the"
9158,CONCLUSION,"beginning of Book II.--we have already discussed (see Chapter IV.), and"
9159,CONCLUSION,"do not think that any explanation is needed, when we understand that"
9160,CONCLUSION,"Agamemnon, once wide-awake, had no confidence in his dream. However, Mr."
9161,CONCLUSION,"Jevons thinks that rhapsodists, anxious to recite straight on from the"
9162,CONCLUSION,"dream to the battle, added II. 35-41, ""the only lines which represent"

9165,CONCLUSION,
9166,CONCLUSION,"Thus, in our way of looking at these things, interpolations by"

9168,CONCLUSION,"granted that the rhapsodists, like the _jongleurs_, had texts, and that"
9169,CONCLUSION,"these were studied by the makers of the Vulgate, interpolations and"
9170,CONCLUSION,"errors might creep in by this way. As to changes in language, ""a"
