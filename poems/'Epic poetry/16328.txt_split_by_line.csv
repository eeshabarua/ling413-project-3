173,PREFACE.,
174,PREFACE.,
175,PREFACE.,"The present work is a modest effort to reproduce approximately, in modern"
176,PREFACE.,"measures, the venerable epic, Beowulf. _Approximately_, I repeat; for a"
177,PREFACE.,"very close reproduction of Anglo-Saxon verse would, to a large extent, be"
178,PREFACE.,prose to a modern ear.
179,PREFACE.,
180,PREFACE.,The Heyne-Socin text and glossary have been closely followed. Occasionally
181,PREFACE.,"a deviation has been made, but always for what seemed good and sufficient"
182,PREFACE.,"reason. The translator does not aim to be an editor. Once in a while,"
183,PREFACE.,"however, he has added a conjecture of his own to the emendations quoted"
184,PREFACE.,from the criticisms of other students of the poem.
185,PREFACE.,
186,PREFACE.,This work is addressed to two classes of readers. From both of these alike
187,PREFACE.,the translator begs sympathy and co-operation. The Anglo-Saxon scholar he
188,PREFACE.,hopes to please by adhering faithfully to the original. The student of
189,PREFACE.,"English literature he aims to interest by giving him, in modern garb, the"
190,PREFACE.,most ancient epic of our race. This is a bold and venturesome undertaking;
191,PREFACE.,and yet there must be some students of the Teutonic past willing to follow
192,PREFACE.,"even a daring guide, if they may read in modern phrases of the sorrows of"
193,PREFACE.,"Hrothgar, of the prowess of Beowulf, and of the feelings that stirred the"
194,PREFACE.,hearts of our forefathers in their primeval homes.
195,PREFACE.,
196,PREFACE.,"In order to please the larger class of readers, a regular cadence has been"
197,PREFACE.,"used, a measure which, while retaining the essential characteristics of"
198,PREFACE.,"the original, permits the reader to see ahead of him in reading."
199,PREFACE.,
200,PREFACE.,Perhaps every Anglo-Saxon scholar has his own theory as to how Beowulf
201,PREFACE.,should be translated. Some have given us prose versions of what we believe
202,PREFACE.,to be a great poem. Is it any reflection on our honored Kemble and Arnold
203,PREFACE.,to say that their translations fail to show a layman that Beowulf is
204,PREFACE.,"justly called our first _epic_? Of those translators who have used verse,"
205,PREFACE.,several have written from what would seem a mistaken point of view. Is it
206,PREFACE.,"proper, for instance, that the grave and solemn speeches of Beowulf and"
207,PREFACE.,"Hrothgar be put in ballad measures, tripping lightly and airily along? Or,"
208,PREFACE.,"again, is it fitting that the rough martial music of Anglo-Saxon verse be"
209,PREFACE.,interpreted to us in the smooth measures of modern blank verse? Do we hear
210,PREFACE.,"what has been beautifully called ""the clanging tread of a warrior in"
211,PREFACE.,"mail""?"
212,PREFACE.,
213,PREFACE.,[viii]
214,PREFACE.,
215,PREFACE.,"Of all English translations of Beowulf, that of Professor Garnett alone"
216,PREFACE.,gives any adequate idea of the chief characteristics of this great
217,PREFACE.,Teutonic epic.
218,PREFACE.,
219,PREFACE.,The measure used in the present translation is believed to be as near a
220,PREFACE.,reproduction of the original as modern English affords. The cadences
221,PREFACE.,closely resemble those used by Browning in some of his most striking
222,PREFACE.,"poems. The four stresses of the Anglo-Saxon verse are retained, and as"
223,PREFACE.,much thesis and anacrusis is allowed as is consistent with a regular
224,PREFACE.,cadence. Alliteration has been used to a large extent; but it was thought
225,PREFACE.,that modern ears would hardly tolerate it on every line. End-rhyme has
226,PREFACE.,"been used occasionally; internal rhyme, sporadically. Both have some"
227,PREFACE.,"warrant in Anglo-Saxon poetry. (For end-rhyme, see 1_53, 1_54; for"

230,PREFACE.,"What Gummere[1] calls the ""rime-giver"" has been studiously kept; _viz._,"
231,PREFACE.,the first accented syllable in the second half-verse always carries the
232,PREFACE.,alliteration; and the last accented syllable alliterates only
233,PREFACE.,sporadically. Alternate alliteration is occasionally used as in the
234,PREFACE.,"original. (See 7_61, 8_5.)"
235,PREFACE.,
236,PREFACE.,"No two accented syllables have been brought together, except occasionally"
237,PREFACE.,"after a cæsural pause. (See 2_19 and 12_1.) Or, scientifically speaking,"
238,PREFACE.,Sievers's C type has been avoided as not consonant with the plan of
239,PREFACE.,"translation. Several of his types, however, constantly occur; _e.g._ A and"
240,PREFACE.,a variant (/ x | / x) (/ x x | / x); B and a variant (x / | x / ) (x x / |
241,PREFACE.,x / ); a variant of D (/ x | / x x); E (/ x x | / ). Anacrusis gives
242,PREFACE.,further variety to the types used in the translation.
243,PREFACE.,
244,PREFACE.,"The parallelisms of the original have been faithfully preserved. (_E.g._,"
245,PREFACE.,"1_16 and 1_17: ""Lord"" and ""Wielder of Glory""; 1_30, 1_31, 1_32; 2_12 and"
246,PREFACE.,"2_13; 2_27 and 2_28; 3_5 and 3_6.) Occasionally, some loss has been"
247,PREFACE.,"sustained; but, on the other hand, a gain has here and there been made."
248,PREFACE.,
249,PREFACE.,The effort has been made to give a decided flavor of archaism to the
250,PREFACE.,translation. All words not in keeping with the spirit of the poem have
251,PREFACE.,"been avoided. Again, though many archaic words have been used, there are"
252,PREFACE.,"none, it is believed, which are not found in standard modern poetry."

260,_THE STORY._,_THE STORY._
261,_THE STORY._,
262,_THE STORY._,"_Hrothgar, king of the Danes, or Scyldings, builds a great mead-hall, or"
263,_THE STORY._,"palace, in which he hopes to feast his liegemen and to give them presents."
264,_THE STORY._,"The joy of king and retainers is, however, of short duration. Grendel, the"
265,_THE STORY._,"monster, is seized with hateful jealousy. He cannot brook the sounds of"
266,_THE STORY._,joyance that reach him down in his fen-dwelling near the hall. Oft and
267,_THE STORY._,"anon he goes to the joyous building, bent on direful mischief. Thane after"
268,_THE STORY._,"thane is ruthlessly carried off and devoured, while no one is found strong"
269,_THE STORY._,enough and bold enough to cope with the monster. For twelve years he
270,_THE STORY._,persecutes Hrothgar and his vassals._
271,_THE STORY._,
272,_THE STORY._,"_Over sea, a day's voyage off, Beowulf, of the Geats, nephew of Higelac,"
273,_THE STORY._,"king of the Geats, hears of Grendel's doings and of Hrothgar's misery. He"
274,_THE STORY._,resolves to crush the fell monster and relieve the aged king. With
275,_THE STORY._,"fourteen chosen companions, he sets sail for Dane-land. Reaching that"
276,_THE STORY._,"country, he soon persuades Hrothgar of his ability to help him. The hours"
277,_THE STORY._,that elapse before night are spent in beer-drinking and conversation. When
278,_THE STORY._,"Hrothgar's bedtime comes he leaves the hall in charge of Beowulf, telling"
279,_THE STORY._,him that never before has he given to another the absolute wardship of his
280,_THE STORY._,"palace. All retire to rest, Beowulf, as it were, sleeping upon his arms._"
281,_THE STORY._,
282,_THE STORY._,"_Grendel comes, the great march-stepper, bearing God's anger. He seizes"
283,_THE STORY._,and kills one of the sleeping warriors. Then he advances towards Beowulf.
284,_THE STORY._,"A fierce and desperate hand-to-hand struggle ensues. No arms are used,"
285,_THE STORY._,both combatants trusting to strength and hand-grip. Beowulf tears
286,_THE STORY._,"Grendel's shoulder from its socket, and the monster retreats to his den,"
287,_THE STORY._,howling and yelling with agony and fury. The wound is fatal._
288,_THE STORY._,
289,_THE STORY._,"_The next morning, at early dawn, warriors in numbers flock to the hall"
290,_THE STORY._,"Heorot, to hear the news. Joy is boundless. Glee runs high. Hrothgar and"
291,_THE STORY._,his retainers are lavish of gratitude and of gifts._
292,_THE STORY._,
293,_THE STORY._,"_Grendel's mother, however, comes the next night to avenge his death. She"
294,_THE STORY._,is furious and raging. While Beowulf is sleeping in a room somewhat apart
295,_THE STORY._,"[x] from the quarters of the other warriors, she seizes one of Hrothgar's"
296,_THE STORY._,"favorite counsellors, and carries him off and devours him. Beowulf is"
297,_THE STORY._,"called. Determined to leave Heorot entirely purified, he arms himself, and"
298,_THE STORY._,goes down to look for the female monster. After traveling through the
299,_THE STORY._,"waters many hours, he meets her near the sea-bottom. She drags him to her"
300,_THE STORY._,den. There he sees Grendel lying dead. After a desperate and almost fatal
301,_THE STORY._,"struggle with the woman, he slays her, and swims upward in triumph, taking"
302,_THE STORY._,with him Grendel's head._
303,_THE STORY._,
304,_THE STORY._,_Joy is renewed at Heorot. Congratulations crowd upon the victor. Hrothgar
305,_THE STORY._,literally pours treasures into the lap of Beowulf; and it is agreed among
306,_THE STORY._,the vassals of the king that Beowulf will be their next liegelord._
307,_THE STORY._,
308,_THE STORY._,_Beowulf leaves Dane-land. Hrothgar weeps and laments at his departure._
309,_THE STORY._,
310,_THE STORY._,"_When the hero arrives in his own land, Higelac treats him as a"
311,_THE STORY._,distinguished guest. He is the hero of the hour._
312,_THE STORY._,
313,_THE STORY._,"_Beowulf subsequently becomes king of his own people, the Geats. After he"
314,_THE STORY._,"has been ruling for fifty years, his own neighborhood is wofully harried"
315,_THE STORY._,by a fire-spewing dragon. Beowulf determines to kill him. In the ensuing
316,_THE STORY._,struggle both Beowulf and the dragon are slain. The grief of the Geats is
317,_THE STORY._,"inexpressible. They determine, however, to leave nothing undone to honor"
318,_THE STORY._,"the memory of their lord. A great funeral-pyre is built, and his body is"
319,_THE STORY._,"burnt. Then a memorial-barrow is made, visible from a great distance, that"
320,_THE STORY._,sailors afar may be constantly reminded of the prowess of the national
321,_THE STORY._,hero of Geatland._
322,_THE STORY._,
323,_THE STORY._,"_The poem closes with a glowing tribute to his bravery, his gentleness,"
324,_THE STORY._,"his goodness of heart, and his generosity._"

327,_THE STORY._,
328,_THE STORY._,It is the devout desire of this translator to hasten the day when the
329,_THE STORY._,story of Beowulf shall be as familiar to English-speaking peoples as that
330,_THE STORY._,of the Iliad. Beowulf is our first great epic. It is an epitomized history
331,_THE STORY._,of the life of the Teutonic races. It brings vividly before us our
332,_THE STORY._,"forefathers of pre-Alfredian eras, in their love of war, of sea, and of"
333,_THE STORY._,adventure.
334,_THE STORY._,
335,_THE STORY._,My special thanks are due to Professors Francis A. March and James A.
336,_THE STORY._,"Harrison, for advice, sympathy, and assistance."

1377,BEOWULF GOES TO HROTHGAR'S ASSISTANCE.,"being away from home, heard of Hrothgar's troubles, etc_. Another,"
1378,BEOWULF GOES TO HROTHGAR'S ASSISTANCE.,"that adopted by S. and endorsed in the H.-So. notes, is: _B. heard"
1379,BEOWULF GOES TO HROTHGAR'S ASSISTANCE.,"from his neighborhood (neighbors),_ i.e. _in his home, etc_. A third"
1380,BEOWULF GOES TO HROTHGAR'S ASSISTANCE.,"is: _B., being at home, heard this as occurring away from home_. The"
1381,BEOWULF GOES TO HROTHGAR'S ASSISTANCE.,H.-So. glossary and notes conflict.
1382,BEOWULF GOES TO HROTHGAR'S ASSISTANCE.,
1383,BEOWULF GOES TO HROTHGAR'S ASSISTANCE.,[2] 'Eoletes' (224) is marked with a (?) by H.-So.; our rendering
1384,BEOWULF GOES TO HROTHGAR'S ASSISTANCE.,simply follows his conjecture.--Other conjectures as to 'eolet' are:
1385,BEOWULF GOES TO HROTHGAR'S ASSISTANCE.,"(1) _voyage_, (2) _toil_, _labor_, (3) _hasty journey_."
1386,BEOWULF GOES TO HROTHGAR'S ASSISTANCE.,
1387,BEOWULF GOES TO HROTHGAR'S ASSISTANCE.,[3] The lacuna of the MS at this point has been supplied by various
1388,BEOWULF GOES TO HROTHGAR'S ASSISTANCE.,conjectures. The reading adopted by H.-So. has been rendered in the
1389,BEOWULF GOES TO HROTHGAR'S ASSISTANCE.,"above translation. W., like H.-So., makes 'ic' the beginning of a new"
1390,BEOWULF GOES TO HROTHGAR'S ASSISTANCE.,"sentence, but, for 'helmas bæron,' he reads 'hringed stefnan.' This"
1391,BEOWULF GOES TO HROTHGAR'S ASSISTANCE.,has the advantage of giving a parallel to 'brontne ceol' instead of a
1392,BEOWULF GOES TO HROTHGAR'S ASSISTANCE.,"kenning for 'go.'--B puts the (?) after 'holmas', and begins a new"
1393,BEOWULF GOES TO HROTHGAR'S ASSISTANCE.,"sentence at the middle of the line. Translate: _What warriors are ye,"
1394,BEOWULF GOES TO HROTHGAR'S ASSISTANCE.,"clad in armor, who have thus come bringing the foaming vessel over the"
1395,BEOWULF GOES TO HROTHGAR'S ASSISTANCE.,"water way, hither over the seas? For some time on the wall I have been"
1396,BEOWULF GOES TO HROTHGAR'S ASSISTANCE.,"coast guard, etc_. S. endorses most of what B. says, but leaves out"
1397,BEOWULF GOES TO HROTHGAR'S ASSISTANCE.,'on the wall' in the last sentence. If W.'s 'hringed stefnan' be
1398,BEOWULF GOES TO HROTHGAR'S ASSISTANCE.,"accepted, change line 51 above to, _A ring-stemmed vessel hither"
1399,BEOWULF GOES TO HROTHGAR'S ASSISTANCE.,o'ersea_.

5424,XXXV.,{The place of strife is described.}
5425,XXXV.,
5426,XXXV.,"Stone-arches standing, stout-hearted champion,"
5427,XXXV.,Saw a brook from the barrow bubbling out thenceward:

5429,XXXV.,"Not nigh to the hoard, for season the briefest"
5430,XXXV.,"85 Could he brave, without burning, the abyss that was yawning,"
5431,XXXV.,The drake was so fiery. The prince of the Weders

5443,XXXV.,
5444,XXXV.,{The terrible encounter.}

5448,XXXV.,Tow'rd the terrible stranger: the ring-twisted creature's
5449,XXXV.,Heart was then ready to seek for a struggle.

5462,XXXV.,{The dragon coils himself.}
5463,XXXV.,
5464,XXXV.,Quickly together: in corslet he bided.
5465,XXXV.,"[87]  105 He went then in blazes, bended and striding,"
5466,XXXV.,Hasting him forward. His life and body
5467,XXXV.,"The targe well protected, for time-period shorter"
5468,XXXV.,"Than wish demanded for the well-renowned leader,"
5469,XXXV.,"Where he then for the first day was forced to be victor,"
5470,XXXV.,"110 Famous in battle, as Fate had not willed it."
5471,XXXV.,"The lord of the Geatmen uplifted his hand then,"
5472,XXXV.,"Smiting the fire-drake with sword that was precious,"
5473,XXXV.,"That bright on the bone the blade-edge did weaken,"
5474,XXXV.,"Bit more feebly than his folk-leader needed,"
5475,XXXV.,"115 Burdened with bale-griefs. Then the barrow-protector,"
5476,XXXV.,
5477,XXXV.,{The dragon rages}
5478,XXXV.,
5479,XXXV.,"When the sword-blow had fallen, was fierce in his spirit,"
5480,XXXV.,"Flinging his fires, flamings of battle"
5481,XXXV.,Gleamed then afar: the gold-friend of Weders
5482,XXXV.,
5483,XXXV.,{Beowulf's sword fails him.}
5484,XXXV.,
5485,XXXV.,"Boasted no conquests, his battle-sword failed him"
5486,XXXV.,"120 Naked in conflict, as by no means it ought to,"
5487,XXXV.,Long-trusty weapon. 'Twas no slight undertaking
5488,XXXV.,That Ecgtheow's famous offspring would leave
5489,XXXV.,The drake-cavern's bottom; he must live in some region
5490,XXXV.,"Other than this, by the will of the dragon,"
5491,XXXV.,125 As each one of earthmen existence must forfeit.
5492,XXXV.,'Twas early thereafter the excellent warriors
5493,XXXV.,
5494,XXXV.,{The combat is renewed.}
5495,XXXV.,
5496,XXXV.,Met with each other. Anew and afresh
5497,XXXV.,The hoard-ward took heart (gasps heaved then his bosom):
5498,XXXV.,
5499,XXXV.,{The great hero is reduced to extremities.}
5500,XXXV.,
5501,XXXV.,Sorrow he suffered encircled with fire

5505,XXXV.,{His comrades flee!}
5506,XXXV.,
5507,XXXV.,"With valorous spirit, but they sped to the forest,"

5509,XXXV.,
5510,XXXV.,{Blood is thicker than water.}
