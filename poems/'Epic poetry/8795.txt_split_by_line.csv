55,CANTO I,CANTO I
56,CANTO I,
57,CANTO I,
58,CANTO I,O’er better waves to speed her rapid course
59,CANTO I,"The light bark of my genius lifts the sail,"
60,CANTO I,Well pleas’d to leave so cruel sea behind;
61,CANTO I,"And of that second region will I sing,"
62,CANTO I,In which the human spirit from sinful blot
63,CANTO I,"Is purg’d, and for ascent to Heaven prepares."
64,CANTO I,
65,CANTO I,"Here, O ye hallow’d Nine! for in your train"
66,CANTO I,"I follow, here the deadened strain revive;"
67,CANTO I,Nor let Calliope refuse to sound
68,CANTO I,"A somewhat higher song, of that loud tone,"
69,CANTO I,Which when the wretched birds of chattering note
70,CANTO I,"Had heard, they of forgiveness lost all hope."
71,CANTO I,
72,CANTO I,"Sweet hue of eastern sapphire, that was spread"
73,CANTO I,"O’er the serene aspect of the pure air,"
74,CANTO I,"High up as the first circle, to mine eyes"
75,CANTO I,"Unwonted joy renew’d, soon as I ’scap’d"
76,CANTO I,"Forth from the atmosphere of deadly gloom,"
77,CANTO I,That had mine eyes and bosom fill’d with grief.
78,CANTO I,"The radiant planet, that to love invites,"
79,CANTO I,"Made all the orient laugh, and veil’d beneath"
80,CANTO I,"The Pisces’ light, that in his escort came."
81,CANTO I,
82,CANTO I,
83,CANTO I,"To the right hand I turn’d, and fix’d my mind"
84,CANTO I,"On the’ other pole attentive, where I saw"
85,CANTO I,Four stars ne’er seen before save by the ken
86,CANTO I,Of our first parents. Heaven of their rays
87,CANTO I,"Seem’d joyous. O thou northern site, bereft"
88,CANTO I,"Indeed, and widow’d, since of these depriv’d!"
89,CANTO I,
90,CANTO I,"As from this view I had desisted, straight"
91,CANTO I,"Turning a little tow’rds the other pole,"
92,CANTO I,"There from whence now the wain had disappear’d,"
93,CANTO I,I saw an old man standing by my side
94,CANTO I,"Alone, so worthy of rev’rence in his look,"
95,CANTO I,That ne’er from son to father more was ow’d.
96,CANTO I,Low down his beard and mix’d with hoary white
97,CANTO I,"Descended, like his locks, which parting fell"
98,CANTO I,Upon his breast in double fold. The beams
99,CANTO I,Of those four luminaries on his face
100,CANTO I,"So brightly shone, and with such radiance clear"
101,CANTO I,"Deck’d it, that I beheld him as the sun."
102,CANTO I,
103,CANTO I,"“Say who are ye, that stemming the blind stream,"
104,CANTO I,Forth from th’ eternal prison-house have fled?”
105,CANTO I,He spoke and moved those venerable plumes.
106,CANTO I,"“Who hath conducted, or with lantern sure"
107,CANTO I,"Lights you emerging from the depth of night,"
108,CANTO I,That makes the infernal valley ever black?
109,CANTO I,Are the firm statutes of the dread abyss
110,CANTO I,"Broken, or in high heaven new laws ordain’d,"
111,CANTO I,"That thus, condemn’d, ye to my caves approach?”"
112,CANTO I,
113,CANTO I,
114,CANTO I,"My guide, then laying hold on me, by words"
115,CANTO I,"And intimations given with hand and head,"
116,CANTO I,Made my bent knees and eye submissive pay
117,CANTO I,Due reverence; then thus to him replied.
118,CANTO I,
119,CANTO I,“Not of myself I come; a Dame from heaven
120,CANTO I,"Descending, had besought me in my charge"
121,CANTO I,"To bring. But since thy will implies, that more"
122,CANTO I,"Our true condition I unfold at large,"
123,CANTO I,Mine is not to deny thee thy request.
124,CANTO I,This mortal ne’er hath seen the farthest gloom.
125,CANTO I,But erring by his folly had approach’d
126,CANTO I,"So near, that little space was left to turn."
127,CANTO I,"Then, as before I told, I was dispatch’d"
128,CANTO I,"To work his rescue, and no way remain’d"
129,CANTO I,Save this which I have ta’en. I have display’d
130,CANTO I,Before him all the regions of the bad;
131,CANTO I,"And purpose now those spirits to display,"
132,CANTO I,That under thy command are purg’d from sin.
133,CANTO I,How I have brought him would be long to say.
134,CANTO I,"From high descends the virtue, by whose aid"
135,CANTO I,I to thy sight and hearing him have led.
136,CANTO I,Now may our coming please thee. In the search
137,CANTO I,Of liberty he journeys: that how dear
138,CANTO I,"They know, who for her sake have life refus’d."
139,CANTO I,"Thou knowest, to whom death for her was sweet"
140,CANTO I,"In Utica, where thou didst leave those weeds,"
141,CANTO I,That in the last great day will shine so bright.
142,CANTO I,For us the’ eternal edicts are unmov’d:
143,CANTO I,"He breathes, and I am free of Minos’ power,"
144,CANTO I,Abiding in that circle where the eyes
145,CANTO I,"Of thy chaste Marcia beam, who still in look"
146,CANTO I,"Prays thee, O hallow’d spirit! to own her shine."
147,CANTO I,"Then by her love we’ implore thee, let us pass"
148,CANTO I,Through thy sev’n regions; for which best thanks
149,CANTO I,"I for thy favour will to her return,"
150,CANTO I,If mention there below thou not disdain.”
151,CANTO I,
152,CANTO I,"“Marcia so pleasing in my sight was found,”"
153,CANTO I,"He then to him rejoin’d, “while I was there,"
154,CANTO I,That all she ask’d me I was fain to grant.
155,CANTO I,"Now that beyond the’ accursed stream she dwells,"
156,CANTO I,"She may no longer move me, by that law,"
157,CANTO I,"Which was ordain’d me, when I issued thence."
158,CANTO I,"Not so, if Dame from heaven, as thou sayst,"
159,CANTO I,Moves and directs thee; then no flattery needs.
160,CANTO I,Enough for me that in her name thou ask.
161,CANTO I,Go therefore now: and with a slender reed
162,CANTO I,"See that thou duly gird him, and his face"
163,CANTO I,"Lave, till all sordid stain thou wipe from thence."
164,CANTO I,"For not with eye, by any cloud obscur’d,"
165,CANTO I,"Would it be seemly before him to come,"
166,CANTO I,Who stands the foremost minister in heaven.
167,CANTO I,"This islet all around, there far beneath,"
168,CANTO I,"Where the wave beats it, on the oozy bed"
169,CANTO I,"Produces store of reeds. No other plant,"
170,CANTO I,"Cover’d with leaves, or harden’d in its stalk,"
171,CANTO I,"There lives, not bending to the water’s sway."
172,CANTO I,"After, this way return not; but the sun"
173,CANTO I,"Will show you, that now rises, where to take"
174,CANTO I,The mountain in its easiest ascent.”
175,CANTO I,
176,CANTO I,He disappear’d; and I myself uprais’d
177,CANTO I,"Speechless, and to my guide retiring close,"
178,CANTO I,Toward him turn’d mine eyes. He thus began;
179,CANTO I,“My son! observant thou my steps pursue.
180,CANTO I,"We must retreat to rearward, for that way"
181,CANTO I,The champain to its low extreme declines.”
182,CANTO I,
183,CANTO I,"The dawn had chas’d the matin hour of prime,"
184,CANTO I,"Which deaf before it, so that from afar"
185,CANTO I,I spy’d the trembling of the ocean stream.
186,CANTO I,
187,CANTO I,"We travers’d the deserted plain, as one"
188,CANTO I,"Who, wander’d from his track, thinks every step"
189,CANTO I,Trodden in vain till he regain the path.
190,CANTO I,
191,CANTO I,"When we had come, where yet the tender dew"
192,CANTO I,"Strove with the sun, and in a place, where fresh"
193,CANTO I,"The wind breath’d o’er it, while it slowly dried;"
194,CANTO I,Both hands extended on the watery grass
195,CANTO I,"My master plac’d, in graceful act and kind."
196,CANTO I,"Whence I of his intent before appriz’d,"
197,CANTO I,Stretch’d out to him my cheeks suffus’d with tears.
198,CANTO I,There to my visage he anew restor’d
199,CANTO I,"That hue, which the dun shades of hell conceal’d."
200,CANTO I,
201,CANTO I,"Then on the solitary shore arriv’d,"
202,CANTO I,That never sailing on its waters saw
203,CANTO I,"Man, that could after measure back his course,"
204,CANTO I,He girt me in such manner as had pleas’d
205,CANTO I,"Him who instructed, and O, strange to tell!"
206,CANTO I,"As he selected every humble plant,"
207,CANTO I,"Wherever one was pluck’d, another there"
208,CANTO I,"Resembling, straightway in its place arose."
209,CANTO I,
210,CANTO I,
211,CANTO I,
212,CANTO I,
213,CANTO II,CANTO II
214,CANTO II,
215,CANTO II,
216,CANTO II,"Now had the sun to that horizon reach’d,"
217,CANTO II,"That covers, with the most exalted point"
218,CANTO II,"Of its meridian circle, Salem’s walls,"
219,CANTO II,"And night, that opposite to him her orb"
220,CANTO II,"Sounds, from the stream of Ganges issued forth,"
221,CANTO II,"Holding the scales, that from her hands are dropp’d"
222,CANTO II,"When she reigns highest: so that where I was,"
223,CANTO II,Aurora’s white and vermeil-tinctur’d cheek
224,CANTO II,To orange turn’d as she in age increas’d.
225,CANTO II,
226,CANTO II,"Meanwhile we linger’d by the water’s brink,"
227,CANTO II,"Like men, who, musing on their road, in thought"
228,CANTO II,"Journey, while motionless the body rests."
229,CANTO II,"When lo! as near upon the hour of dawn,"
230,CANTO II,Through the thick vapours Mars with fiery beam
231,CANTO II,"Glares down in west, over the ocean floor;"
232,CANTO II,"So seem’d, what once again I hope to view,"
233,CANTO II,"A light so swiftly coming through the sea,"
234,CANTO II,No winged course might equal its career.
235,CANTO II,From which when for a space I had withdrawn
236,CANTO II,"Thine eyes, to make inquiry of my guide,"
237,CANTO II,Again I look’d and saw it grown in size
238,CANTO II,And brightness: thou on either side appear’d
239,CANTO II,"Something, but what I knew not of bright hue,"
240,CANTO II,And by degrees from underneath it came
241,CANTO II,Another. My preceptor silent yet
242,CANTO II,"Stood, while the brightness, that we first discern’d,"
243,CANTO II,Open’d the form of wings: then when he knew
244,CANTO II,"The pilot, cried aloud, “Down, down; bend low"
245,CANTO II,Thy knees; behold God’s angel: fold thy hands:
246,CANTO II,Now shalt thou see true Ministers indeed.”
247,CANTO II,
248,CANTO II,
249,CANTO II,Lo how all human means he sets at naught!
250,CANTO II,"So that nor oar he needs, nor other sail"
251,CANTO II,"Except his wings, between such distant shores."
252,CANTO II,"Lo how straight up to heaven he holds them rear’d,"
253,CANTO II,"Winnowing the air with those eternal plumes,"
254,CANTO II,That not like mortal hairs fall off or change!”
255,CANTO II,
256,CANTO II,"As more and more toward us came, more bright"
257,CANTO II,"Appear’d the bird of God, nor could the eye"
258,CANTO II,Endure his splendor near: I mine bent down.
259,CANTO II,He drove ashore in a small bark so swift
260,CANTO II,"And light, that in its course no wave it drank."
261,CANTO II,"The heav’nly steersman at the prow was seen,"
262,CANTO II,Visibly written blessed in his looks.
263,CANTO II,
264,CANTO II,
265,CANTO II,Within a hundred spirits and more there sat.
266,CANTO II,“In Exitu Israel de Aegypto;”
267,CANTO II,"All with one voice together sang, with what"
268,CANTO II,In the remainder of that hymn is writ.
269,CANTO II,Then soon as with the sign of holy cross
270,CANTO II,"He bless’d them, they at once leap’d out on land,"
271,CANTO II,"The swiftly as he came return’d. The crew,"
272,CANTO II,"There left, appear’d astounded with the place,"
273,CANTO II,Gazing around as one who sees new sights.
274,CANTO II,
275,CANTO II,"From every side the sun darted his beams,"
276,CANTO II,And with his arrowy radiance from mid heav’n
277,CANTO II,"Had chas’d the Capricorn, when that strange tribe"
278,CANTO II,"Lifting their eyes towards us: “If ye know,"
279,CANTO II,Declare what path will Lead us to the mount.”
280,CANTO II,
281,CANTO II,Them Virgil answer’d. “Ye suppose perchance
282,CANTO II,"Us well acquainted with this place: but here,"
283,CANTO II,"We, as yourselves, are strangers. Not long erst"
284,CANTO II,"We came, before you but a little space,"
285,CANTO II,"By other road so rough and hard, that now"
286,CANTO II,"The’ ascent will seem to us as play.” The spirits,"
287,CANTO II,"Who from my breathing had perceiv’d I liv’d,"
288,CANTO II,Grew pale with wonder. As the multitude
289,CANTO II,"Flock round a herald, sent with olive branch,"
290,CANTO II,"To hear what news he brings, and in their haste"
291,CANTO II,"Tread one another down, e’en so at sight"
292,CANTO II,"Of me those happy spirits were fix’d, each one"
293,CANTO II,"Forgetful of its errand, to depart,"
294,CANTO II,"Where cleans’d from sin, it might be made all fair."
295,CANTO II,
296,CANTO II,Then one I saw darting before the rest
297,CANTO II,"With such fond ardour to embrace me, I"
298,CANTO II,To do the like was mov’d. O shadows vain
299,CANTO II,Except in outward semblance! thrice my hands
300,CANTO II,"I clasp’d behind it, they as oft return’d"
301,CANTO II,Empty into my breast again. Surprise
302,CANTO II,"I needs must think was painted in my looks,"
303,CANTO II,For that the shadow smil’d and backward drew.
304,CANTO II,"To follow it I hasten’d, but with voice"
305,CANTO II,Of sweetness it enjoin’d me to desist.
306,CANTO II,"Then who it was I knew, and pray’d of it,"
307,CANTO II,"To talk with me, it would a little pause."
308,CANTO II,It answered: “Thee as in my mortal frame
309,CANTO II,"I lov’d, so loos’d forth it I love thee still,"
310,CANTO II,And therefore pause; but why walkest thou here?”
311,CANTO II,
312,CANTO II,"“Not without purpose once more to return,"
313,CANTO II,"Thou find’st me, my Casella, where I am"
314,CANTO II,"Journeying this way;” I said, “but how of thee"
315,CANTO II,Hath so much time been lost?” He answer’d straight:
316,CANTO II,"“No outrage hath been done to me, if he"
317,CANTO II,"Who when and whom he chooses takes, me oft"
318,CANTO II,"This passage hath denied, since of just will"
319,CANTO II,"His will he makes. These three months past indeed,"
320,CANTO II,"He, whose chose to enter, with free leave"
321,CANTO II,Hath taken; whence I wand’ring by the shore
322,CANTO II,"Where Tyber’s wave grows salt, of him gain’d kind"
323,CANTO II,"Admittance, at that river’s mouth, tow’rd which"
324,CANTO II,"His wings are pointed, for there always throng"
325,CANTO II,All such as not to Archeron descend.”
326,CANTO II,
327,CANTO II,Then I: “If new laws have not quite destroy’d
328,CANTO II,"Memory and use of that sweet song of love,"
329,CANTO II,That while all my cares had power to ’swage;
330,CANTO II,Please thee with it a little to console
331,CANTO II,"My spirit, that incumber’d with its frame,"
332,CANTO II,"Travelling so far, of pain is overcome.”"
333,CANTO II,
334,CANTO II,“Love that discourses in my thoughts.” He then
335,CANTO II,"Began in such soft accents, that within"
336,CANTO II,The sweetness thrills me yet. My gentle guide
337,CANTO II,"And all who came with him, so well were pleas’d,"
338,CANTO II,That seem’d naught else might in their thoughts have room.
339,CANTO II,
340,CANTO II,Fast fix’d in mute attention to his notes
341,CANTO II,"We stood, when lo! that old man venerable"
342,CANTO II,"Exclaiming, “How is this, ye tardy spirits?"
343,CANTO II,What negligence detains you loit’ring here?
344,CANTO II,"Run to the mountain to cast off those scales,"
345,CANTO II,That from your eyes the sight of God conceal.”
346,CANTO II,
347,CANTO II,"As a wild flock of pigeons, to their food"
348,CANTO II,"Collected, blade or tares, without their pride"
349,CANTO II,"Accustom’d, and in still and quiet sort,"
350,CANTO II,"If aught alarm them, suddenly desert"
351,CANTO II,"Their meal, assail’d by more important care;"
352,CANTO II,"So I that new-come troop beheld, the song"
353,CANTO II,"Deserting, hasten to the mountain’s side,"
354,CANTO II,As one who goes yet where he tends knows not.
355,CANTO II,
356,CANTO II,Nor with less hurried step did we depart.
357,CANTO II,
358,CANTO II,
359,CANTO II,
360,CANTO II,
361,CANTO III,CANTO III
362,CANTO III,
363,CANTO III,
364,CANTO III,"Them sudden flight had scatter’d over the plain,"
365,CANTO III,"Turn’d tow’rds the mountain, whither reason’s voice"
366,CANTO III,Drives us; I to my faithful company
367,CANTO III,"Adhering, left it not. For how of him"
368,CANTO III,"Depriv’d, might I have sped, or who beside"
369,CANTO III,Would o’er the mountainous tract have led my steps
370,CANTO III,He with the bitter pang of self-remorse
371,CANTO III,Seem’d smitten. O clear conscience and upright
372,CANTO III,How doth a little fling wound thee sore!
373,CANTO III,
374,CANTO III,"Soon as his feet desisted (slack’ning pace),"
375,CANTO III,"From haste, that mars all decency of act,"
376,CANTO III,"My mind, that in itself before was wrapt,"
377,CANTO III,"Its thoughts expanded, as with joy restor’d:"
378,CANTO III,And full against the steep ascent I set
379,CANTO III,"My face, where highest to heav’n its top o’erflows."
380,CANTO III,
381,CANTO III,"The sun, that flar’d behind, with ruddy beam"
382,CANTO III,Before my form was broken; for in me
383,CANTO III,His rays resistance met. I turn’d aside
384,CANTO III,"With fear of being left, when I beheld"
385,CANTO III,Only before myself the ground obscur’d.
386,CANTO III,"When thus my solace, turning him around,"
387,CANTO III,Bespake me kindly: “Why distrustest thou?
388,CANTO III,"Believ’st not I am with thee, thy sure guide?"
389,CANTO III,"It now is evening there, where buried lies"
390,CANTO III,"The body, in which I cast a shade, remov’d"
391,CANTO III,To Naples from Brundusium’s wall. Nor thou
392,CANTO III,"Marvel, if before me no shadow fall,"
393,CANTO III,More than that in the sky element
394,CANTO III,One ray obstructs not other. To endure
395,CANTO III,"Torments of heat and cold extreme, like frames"
396,CANTO III,"That virtue hath dispos’d, which how it works"
397,CANTO III,Wills not to us should be reveal’d. Insane
398,CANTO III,"Who hopes, our reason may that space explore,"
399,CANTO III,Which holds three persons in one substance knit.
400,CANTO III,"Seek not the wherefore, race of human kind;"
401,CANTO III,"Could ye have seen the whole, no need had been"
402,CANTO III,For Mary to bring forth. Moreover ye
403,CANTO III,Have seen such men desiring fruitlessly;
404,CANTO III,"To whose desires repose would have been giv’n,"
405,CANTO III,That now but serve them for eternal grief.
406,CANTO III,"I speak of Plato, and the Stagyrite,"
407,CANTO III,And others many more.” And then he bent
408,CANTO III,"Downwards his forehead, and in troubled mood"
409,CANTO III,Broke off his speech. Meanwhile we had arriv’d
410,CANTO III,"Far as the mountain’s foot, and there the rock"
411,CANTO III,"Found of so steep ascent, that nimblest steps"
412,CANTO III,To climb it had been vain. The most remote
413,CANTO III,"Most wild untrodden path, in all the tract"
414,CANTO III,’Twixt Lerice and Turbia were to this
415,CANTO III,A ladder easy’ and open of access.
416,CANTO III,
417,CANTO III,“Who knows on which hand now the steep declines?”
418,CANTO III,"My master said and paus’d, “so that he may"
419,CANTO III,"Ascend, who journeys without aid of wine?”"
420,CANTO III,And while with looks directed to the ground
421,CANTO III,"The meaning of the pathway he explor’d,"
422,CANTO III,"And I gaz’d upward round the stony height,"
423,CANTO III,"Of spirits, that toward us mov’d their steps,"
424,CANTO III,"Yet moving seem’d not, they so slow approach’d."
425,CANTO III,
426,CANTO III,
427,CANTO III,"I thus my guide address’d: “Upraise thine eyes,"
428,CANTO III,"Lo that way some, of whom thou may’st obtain"
429,CANTO III,"Counsel, if of thyself thou find’st it not!”"
430,CANTO III,
431,CANTO III,"Straightway he look’d, and with free speech replied:"
432,CANTO III,“Let us tend thither: they but softly come.
433,CANTO III,"And thou be firm in hope, my son belov’d.”"
434,CANTO III,
435,CANTO III,Now was that people distant far in space
436,CANTO III,"A thousand paces behind ours, as much"
437,CANTO III,"As at a throw the nervous arm could fling,"
438,CANTO III,When all drew backward on the messy crags
439,CANTO III,"Of the steep bank, and firmly stood unmov’d"
440,CANTO III,As one who walks in doubt might stand to look.
441,CANTO III,
442,CANTO III,“O spirits perfect! O already chosen!”
443,CANTO III,"Virgil to them began, “by that blest peace,"
444,CANTO III,"Which, as I deem, is for you all prepar’d,"
445,CANTO III,"Instruct us where the mountain low declines,"
446,CANTO III,So that attempt to mount it be not vain.
447,CANTO III,"For who knows most, him loss of time most grieves.”"
448,CANTO III,
449,CANTO III,"As sheep, that step from forth their fold, by one,"
450,CANTO III,"Or pairs, or three at once; meanwhile the rest"
451,CANTO III,"Stand fearfully, bending the eye and nose"
452,CANTO III,"To ground, and what the foremost does, that do"
453,CANTO III,"The others, gath’ring round her, if she stops,"
454,CANTO III,"Simple and quiet, nor the cause discern;"
455,CANTO III,"So saw I moving to advance the first,"
456,CANTO III,"Who of that fortunate crew were at the head,"
457,CANTO III,Of modest mien and graceful in their gait.
458,CANTO III,When they before me had beheld the light
459,CANTO III,"From my right side fall broken on the ground,"
460,CANTO III,"So that the shadow reach’d the cave, they stopp’d"
461,CANTO III,"And somewhat back retir’d: the same did all,"
462,CANTO III,"Who follow’d, though unweeting of the cause."
463,CANTO III,
464,CANTO III,"“Unask’d of you, yet freely I confess,"
465,CANTO III,This is a human body which ye see.
466,CANTO III,"That the sun’s light is broken on the ground,"
467,CANTO III,"Marvel not: but believe, that not without"
468,CANTO III,"Virtue deriv’d from Heaven, we to climb"
469,CANTO III,Over this wall aspire.” So them bespake
470,CANTO III,My master; and that virtuous tribe rejoin’d;
471,CANTO III,"“Turn, and before you there the entrance lies,”"
472,CANTO III,Making a signal to us with bent hands.
473,CANTO III,
474,CANTO III,"Then of them one began. “Whoe’er thou art,"
475,CANTO III,"Who journey’st thus this way, thy visage turn,"
476,CANTO III,Think if me elsewhere thou hast ever seen.”
477,CANTO III,
478,CANTO III,"I tow’rds him turn’d, and with fix’d eye beheld."
479,CANTO III,"Comely, and fair, and gentle of aspect,"
480,CANTO III,"He seem’d, but on one brow a gash was mark’d."
481,CANTO III,
482,CANTO III,When humbly I disclaim’d to have beheld
483,CANTO III,"Him ever: “Now behold!” he said, and show’d"
484,CANTO III,High on his breast a wound: then smiling spake.
485,CANTO III,
486,CANTO III,"“I am Manfredi, grandson to the Queen"
487,CANTO III,"Costanza: whence I pray thee, when return’d,"
488,CANTO III,"To my fair daughter go, the parent glad"
489,CANTO III,Of Aragonia and Sicilia’s pride;
490,CANTO III,"And of the truth inform her, if of me"
491,CANTO III,Aught else be told. When by two mortal blows
492,CANTO III,"My frame was shatter’d, I betook myself"
493,CANTO III,"Weeping to him, who of free will forgives."
494,CANTO III,My sins were horrible; but so wide arms
495,CANTO III,"Hath goodness infinite, that it receives"
496,CANTO III,All who turn to it. Had this text divine
497,CANTO III,"Been of Cosenza’s shepherd better scann’d,"
498,CANTO III,"Who then by Clement on my hunt was set,"
499,CANTO III,"Yet at the bridge’s head my bones had lain,"
500,CANTO III,"Near Benevento, by the heavy mole"
501,CANTO III,"Protected; but the rain now drenches them,"
502,CANTO III,"And the wind drives, out of the kingdom’s bounds,"
503,CANTO III,"Far as the stream of Verde, where, with lights"
504,CANTO III,"Extinguish’d, he remov’d them from their bed."
505,CANTO III,"Yet by their curse we are not so destroy’d,"
506,CANTO III,"But that the eternal love may turn, while hope"
507,CANTO III,"Retains her verdant blossoms. True it is,"
508,CANTO III,That such one as in contumacy dies
509,CANTO III,"Against the holy church, though he repent,"
510,CANTO III,Must wander thirty-fold for all the time
511,CANTO III,In his presumption past; if such decree
512,CANTO III,Be not by prayers of good men shorter made
513,CANTO III,Look therefore if thou canst advance my bliss;
514,CANTO III,"Revealing to my good Costanza, how"
515,CANTO III,"Thou hast beheld me, and beside the terms"
516,CANTO III,Laid on me of that interdict; for here
517,CANTO III,By means of those below much profit comes.”
518,CANTO III,
519,CANTO III,
520,CANTO III,
521,CANTO III,
522,CANTO IV,CANTO IV
523,CANTO IV,
524,CANTO IV,
525,CANTO IV,"When by sensations of delight or pain,"
526,CANTO IV,"That any of our faculties hath seiz’d,"
527,CANTO IV,"Entire the soul collects herself, it seems"
528,CANTO IV,"She is intent upon that power alone,"
529,CANTO IV,And thus the error is disprov’d which holds
530,CANTO IV,The soul not singly lighted in the breast.
531,CANTO IV,"And therefore when as aught is heard or seen,"
532,CANTO IV,"That firmly keeps the soul toward it turn’d,"
533,CANTO IV,"Time passes, and a man perceives it not."
534,CANTO IV,"For that, whereby he hearken, is one power,"
535,CANTO IV,"Another that, which the whole spirit hash;"
536,CANTO IV,"This is as it were bound, while that is free."
537,CANTO IV,
538,CANTO IV,"This found I true by proof, hearing that spirit"
539,CANTO IV,And wond’ring; for full fifty steps aloft
540,CANTO IV,"The sun had measur’d unobserv’d of me,"
541,CANTO IV,When we arriv’d where all with one accord
542,CANTO IV,"The spirits shouted, “Here is what ye ask.”"
543,CANTO IV,
544,CANTO IV,A larger aperture ofttimes is stopp’d
545,CANTO IV,"With forked stake of thorn by villager,"
546,CANTO IV,"When the ripe grape imbrowns, than was the path,"
547,CANTO IV,"By which my guide, and I behind him close,"
548,CANTO IV,"Ascended solitary, when that troop"
549,CANTO IV,Departing left us. On Sanleo’s road
550,CANTO IV,"Who journeys, or to Noli low descends,"
551,CANTO IV,"Or mounts Bismantua’s height, must use his feet;"
552,CANTO IV,"But here a man had need to fly, I mean"
553,CANTO IV,"With the swift wing and plumes of high desire,"
554,CANTO IV,"Conducted by his aid, who gave me hope,"
555,CANTO IV,And with light furnish’d to direct my way.
556,CANTO IV,
557,CANTO IV,
558,CANTO IV,"We through the broken rock ascended, close"
559,CANTO IV,"Pent on each side, while underneath the ground"
560,CANTO IV,Ask’d help of hands and feet. When we arriv’d
561,CANTO IV,"Near on the highest ridge of the steep bank,"
562,CANTO IV,"Where the plain level open’d I exclaim’d,"
563,CANTO IV,“O master! say which way can we proceed?”
564,CANTO IV,
565,CANTO IV,"He answer’d, “Let no step of thine recede."
566,CANTO IV,"Behind me gain the mountain, till to us"
567,CANTO IV,Some practis’d guide appear.” That eminence
568,CANTO IV,"Was lofty that no eye might reach its point,"
569,CANTO IV,"And the side proudly rising, more than line"
570,CANTO IV,From the mid quadrant to the centre drawn.
571,CANTO IV,I wearied thus began: “Parent belov’d!
572,CANTO IV,"Turn, and behold how I remain alone,"
573,CANTO IV,"If thou stay not.”—“My son!” He straight reply’d,"
574,CANTO IV,“Thus far put forth thy strength;” and to a track
575,CANTO IV,"Pointed, that, on this side projecting, round"
576,CANTO IV,"Circles the hill. His words so spurr’d me on,"
577,CANTO IV,"That I behind him clamb’ring, forc’d myself,"
578,CANTO IV,Till my feet press’d the circuit plain beneath.
579,CANTO IV,"There both together seated, turn’d we round"
580,CANTO IV,"To eastward, whence was our ascent: and oft"
581,CANTO IV,Many beside have with delight look’d back.
582,CANTO IV,
583,CANTO IV,"First on the nether shores I turn’d my eyes,"
584,CANTO IV,"Then rais’d them to the sun, and wond’ring mark’d"
585,CANTO IV,That from the left it smote us. Soon perceiv’d
586,CANTO IV,That Poet sage now at the car of light
587,CANTO IV,"Amaz’d I stood, where ’twixt us and the north"
588,CANTO IV,Its course it enter’d. Whence he thus to me:
589,CANTO IV,“Were Leda’s offspring now in company
590,CANTO IV,"Of that broad mirror, that high up and low"
591,CANTO IV,"Imparts his light beneath, thou might’st behold"
592,CANTO IV,The ruddy zodiac nearer to the bears
593,CANTO IV,"Wheel, if its ancient course it not forsook."
594,CANTO IV,How that may be if thou would’st think; within
595,CANTO IV,"Pond’ring, imagine Sion with this mount"
596,CANTO IV,"Plac’d on the earth, so that to both be one"
597,CANTO IV,"Horizon, and two hemispheres apart,"
598,CANTO IV,Where lies the path that Phaeton ill knew
599,CANTO IV,To guide his erring chariot: thou wilt see
600,CANTO IV,How of necessity by this on one
601,CANTO IV,"He passes, while by that on the’ other side,"
602,CANTO IV,If with clear view shine intellect attend.”
603,CANTO IV,
604,CANTO IV,"“Of truth, kind teacher!” I exclaim’d, “so clear"
605,CANTO IV,"Aught saw I never, as I now discern"
606,CANTO IV,"Where seem’d my ken to fail, that the mid orb"
607,CANTO IV,Of the supernal motion (which in terms
608,CANTO IV,"Of art is called the Equator, and remains"
609,CANTO IV,Ever between the sun and winter) for the cause
610,CANTO IV,"Thou hast assign’d, from hence toward the north"
611,CANTO IV,"Departs, when those who in the Hebrew land"
612,CANTO IV,"Inhabit, see it tow’rds the warmer part."
613,CANTO IV,"But if it please thee, I would gladly know,"
614,CANTO IV,How far we have to journey: for the hill
615,CANTO IV,"Mounts higher, than this sight of mine can mount.”"
616,CANTO IV,
617,CANTO IV,"He thus to me: “Such is this steep ascent,"
618,CANTO IV,"That it is ever difficult at first,"
619,CANTO IV,"But, more a man proceeds, less evil grows."
620,CANTO IV,"When pleasant it shall seem to thee, so much"
621,CANTO IV,That upward going shall be easy to thee.
622,CANTO IV,"As in a vessel to go down the tide,"
623,CANTO IV,Then of this path thou wilt have reach’d the end.
624,CANTO IV,There hope to rest thee from thy toil. No more
625,CANTO IV,"I answer, and thus far for certain know.”"
626,CANTO IV,"As he his words had spoken, near to us"
627,CANTO IV,A voice there sounded: “Yet ye first perchance
628,CANTO IV,May to repose you by constraint be led.”
629,CANTO IV,"At sound thereof each turn’d, and on the left"
630,CANTO IV,"A huge stone we beheld, of which nor I"
631,CANTO IV,"Nor he before was ware. Thither we drew,"
632,CANTO IV,"find there were some, who in the shady place"
633,CANTO IV,"Behind the rock were standing, as a man"
634,CANTO IV,"Thru’ idleness might stand. Among them one,"
635,CANTO IV,"Who seem’d to me much wearied, sat him down,"
636,CANTO IV,"And with his arms did fold his knees about,"
637,CANTO IV,Holding his face between them downward bent.
638,CANTO IV,
639,CANTO IV,
640,CANTO IV,"“Sweet Sir!” I cry’d, “behold that man, who shows"
641,CANTO IV,"Himself more idle, than if laziness"
642,CANTO IV,"Were sister to him.” Straight he turn’d to us,"
643,CANTO IV,"And, o’er the thigh lifting his face, observ’d,"
644,CANTO IV,"Then in these accents spake: “Up then, proceed"
645,CANTO IV,Thou valiant one.” Straight who it was I knew;
646,CANTO IV,Nor could the pain I felt (for want of breath
647,CANTO IV,Still somewhat urg’d me) hinder my approach.
648,CANTO IV,"And when I came to him, he scarce his head"
649,CANTO IV,"Uplifted, saying “Well hast thou discern’d,"
650,CANTO IV,How from the left the sun his chariot leads.”
651,CANTO IV,
652,CANTO IV,His lazy acts and broken words my lips
653,CANTO IV,To laughter somewhat mov’d; when I began:
654,CANTO IV,"“Belacqua, now for thee I grieve no more."
655,CANTO IV,"But tell, why thou art seated upright there?"
656,CANTO IV,Waitest thou escort to conduct thee hence?
657,CANTO IV,Or blame I only shine accustom’d ways?”
658,CANTO IV,"Then he: “My brother, of what use to mount,"
659,CANTO IV,When to my suffering would not let me pass
660,CANTO IV,"The bird of God, who at the portal sits?"
661,CANTO IV,Behooves so long that heav’n first bear me round
662,CANTO IV,"Without its limits, as in life it bore,"
663,CANTO IV,Because I to the end repentant Sighs
664,CANTO IV,"Delay’d, if prayer do not aid me first,"
665,CANTO IV,That riseth up from heart which lives in grace.
666,CANTO IV,"What other kind avails, not heard in heaven?”"
667,CANTO IV,
668,CANTO IV,Before me now the Poet up the mount
669,CANTO IV,"Ascending, cried: “Haste thee, for see the sun"
670,CANTO IV,"Has touch’d the point meridian, and the night"
671,CANTO IV,Now covers with her foot Marocco’s shore.”
672,CANTO IV,
673,CANTO IV,
674,CANTO IV,
675,CANTO IV,
676,CANTO V,CANTO V
677,CANTO V,
678,CANTO V,
679,CANTO V,"Now had I left those spirits, and pursued"
680,CANTO V,"The steps of my Conductor, when beheld"
681,CANTO V,Pointing the finger at me one exclaim’d:
682,CANTO V,“See how it seems as if the light not shone
683,CANTO V,"From the left hand of him beneath, and he,"
684,CANTO V,"As living, seems to be led on.” Mine eyes"
685,CANTO V,"I at that sound reverting, saw them gaze"
686,CANTO V,"Through wonder first at me, and then at me"
687,CANTO V,"And the light broken underneath, by turns."
688,CANTO V,“Why are thy thoughts thus riveted?” my guide
689,CANTO V,"Exclaim’d, “that thou hast slack’d thy pace? or how"
690,CANTO V,"Imports it thee, what thing is whisper’d here?"
691,CANTO V,"Come after me, and to their babblings leave"
692,CANTO V,"The crowd. Be as a tower, that, firmly set,"
693,CANTO V,Shakes not its top for any blast that blows!
694,CANTO V,"He, in whose bosom thought on thought shoots out,"
695,CANTO V,"Still of his aim is wide, in that the one"
696,CANTO V,Sicklies and wastes to nought the other’s strength.”
697,CANTO V,What other could I answer save “I come?”
698,CANTO V,"I said it, somewhat with that colour ting’d"
699,CANTO V,Which ofttimes pardon meriteth for man.
700,CANTO V,"Meanwhile traverse along the hill there came,"
701,CANTO V,"A little way before us, some who sang"
702,CANTO V,The “Miserere” in responsive Strains.
703,CANTO V,When they perceiv’d that through my body I
704,CANTO V,"Gave way not for the rays to pass, their song"
705,CANTO V,Straight to a long and hoarse exclaim they chang’d;
706,CANTO V,"And two of them, in guise of messengers,"
707,CANTO V,"Ran on to meet us, and inquiring ask’d:"
708,CANTO V,“Of your condition we would gladly learn.”
709,CANTO V,"To them my guide. “Ye may return, and bear"
710,CANTO V,"Tidings to them who sent you, that his frame"
711,CANTO V,"Is real flesh. If, as I deem, to view"
712,CANTO V,"His shade they paus’d, enough is answer’d them."
713,CANTO V,"Him let them honour, they may prize him well.”"
714,CANTO V,Ne’er saw I fiery vapours with such speed
715,CANTO V,"Cut through the serene air at fall of night,"
716,CANTO V,"Nor August’s clouds athwart the setting sun,"
717,CANTO V,That upward these did not in shorter space
718,CANTO V,"Return; and, there arriving, with the rest"
719,CANTO V,"Wheel back on us, as with loose rein a troop."
720,CANTO V,
721,CANTO V,
722,CANTO V,"“Many,” exclaim’d the bard, “are these, who throng"
723,CANTO V,Around us: to petition thee they come.
724,CANTO V,"Go therefore on, and listen as thou go’st.”"
725,CANTO V,“O spirit! who go’st on to blessedness
726,CANTO V,"With the same limbs, that clad thee at thy birth.”"
727,CANTO V,"Shouting they came, “a little rest thy step."
728,CANTO V,Look if thou any one amongst our tribe
729,CANTO V,"Hast e’er beheld, that tidings of him there"
730,CANTO V,"Thou mayst report. Ah, wherefore go’st thou on?"
731,CANTO V,Ah wherefore tarriest thou not? We all
732,CANTO V,"By violence died, and to our latest hour"
733,CANTO V,"Were sinners, but then warn’d by light from heav’n,"
734,CANTO V,"So that, repenting and forgiving, we"
735,CANTO V,"Did issue out of life at peace with God,"
736,CANTO V,Who with desire to see him fills our heart.”
737,CANTO V,Then I: “The visages of all I scan
738,CANTO V,"Yet none of ye remember. But if aught,"
739,CANTO V,"That I can do, may please you, gentle spirits!"
740,CANTO V,"Speak; and I will perform it, by that peace,"
741,CANTO V,Which on the steps of guide so excellent
742,CANTO V,Following from world to world intent I seek.”
743,CANTO V,In answer he began: “None here distrusts
744,CANTO V,"Thy kindness, though not promis’d with an oath;"
745,CANTO V,So as the will fail not for want of power.
746,CANTO V,"Whence I, who sole before the others speak,"
747,CANTO V,"Entreat thee, if thou ever see that land,"
748,CANTO V,Which lies between Romagna and the realm
749,CANTO V,"Of Charles, that of thy courtesy thou pray"
750,CANTO V,"Those who inhabit Fano, that for me"
751,CANTO V,"Their adorations duly be put up,"
752,CANTO V,By which I may purge off my grievous sins.
753,CANTO V,"From thence I came. But the deep passages,"
754,CANTO V,"Whence issued out the blood wherein I dwelt,"
755,CANTO V,Upon my bosom in Antenor’s land
756,CANTO V,"Were made, where to be more secure I thought."
757,CANTO V,"The author of the deed was Este’s prince,"
758,CANTO V,"Who, more than right could warrant, with his wrath"
759,CANTO V,"Pursued me. Had I towards Mira fled,"
760,CANTO V,"When overta’en at Oriaco, still"
761,CANTO V,"Might I have breath’d. But to the marsh I sped,"
762,CANTO V,And in the mire and rushes tangled there
763,CANTO V,"Fell, and beheld my life-blood float the plain.”"
764,CANTO V,"Then said another: “Ah! so may the wish,"
765,CANTO V,"That takes thee o’er the mountain, be fulfill’d,"
766,CANTO V,As thou shalt graciously give aid to mine.
767,CANTO V,Of Montefeltro I; Buonconte I:
768,CANTO V,"Giovanna nor none else have care for me,"
769,CANTO V,Sorrowing with these I therefore go.” I thus:
770,CANTO V,“From Campaldino’s field what force or chance
771,CANTO V,"Drew thee, that ne’er thy sepulture was known?”"
772,CANTO V,"“Oh!” answer’d he, “at Casentino’s foot"
773,CANTO V,"A stream there courseth, nam’d Archiano, sprung"
774,CANTO V,In Apennine above the Hermit’s seat.
775,CANTO V,"E’en where its name is cancel’d, there came I,"
776,CANTO V,"Pierc’d in the heart, fleeing away on foot,"
777,CANTO V,And bloodying the plain. Here sight and speech
778,CANTO V,"Fail’d me, and finishing with Mary’s name"
779,CANTO V,"I fell, and tenantless my flesh remain’d."
780,CANTO V,I will report the truth; which thou again
781,CANTO V,"Tell to the living. Me God’s angel took,"
782,CANTO V,Whilst he of hell exclaim’d: “O thou from heav’n!
783,CANTO V,Say wherefore hast thou robb’d me? Thou of him
784,CANTO V,Th’ eternal portion bear’st with thee away
785,CANTO V,For one poor tear that he deprives me of.
786,CANTO V,"But of the other, other rule I make.”"
787,CANTO V,“Thou knowest how in the atmosphere collects
788,CANTO V,"That vapour dank, returning into water,"
789,CANTO V,Soon as it mounts where cold condenses it.
790,CANTO V,"That evil will, which in his intellect"
791,CANTO V,"Still follows evil, came, and rais’d the wind"
792,CANTO V,"And smoky mist, by virtue of the power"
793,CANTO V,"Given by his nature. Thence the valley, soon"
794,CANTO V,"As day was spent, he cover’d o’er with cloud"
795,CANTO V,"From Pratomagno to the mountain range,"
796,CANTO V,"And stretch’d the sky above, so that the air"
797,CANTO V,"Impregnate chang’d to water. Fell the rain,"
798,CANTO V,And to the fosses came all that the land
799,CANTO V,"Contain’d not; and, as mightiest streams are wont,"
800,CANTO V,To the great river with such headlong sweep
801,CANTO V,"Rush’d, that nought stay’d its course. My stiffen’d frame"
802,CANTO V,"Laid at his mouth the fell Archiano found,"
803,CANTO V,"And dash’d it into Arno, from my breast"
804,CANTO V,"Loos’ning the cross, that of myself I made"
805,CANTO V,"When overcome with pain. He hurl’d me on,"
806,CANTO V,Along the banks and bottom of his course;
807,CANTO V,Then in his muddy spoils encircling wrapt.”
808,CANTO V,
809,CANTO V,
810,CANTO V,"“Ah! when thou to the world shalt be return’d,"
811,CANTO V,"And rested after thy long road,” so spake"
812,CANTO V,Next the third spirit; “then remember me.
813,CANTO V,"I once was Pia. Sienna gave me life,"
814,CANTO V,"Maremma took it from me. That he knows,"
815,CANTO V,Who me with jewell’d ring had first espous’d.”
816,CANTO V,
817,CANTO V,
818,CANTO V,
819,CANTO V,
820,CANTO VI,CANTO VI
821,CANTO VI,
822,CANTO VI,
823,CANTO VI,"When from their game of dice men separate,"
824,CANTO VI,"He, who hath lost, remains in sadness fix’d,"
825,CANTO VI,"Revolving in his mind, what luckless throws"
826,CANTO VI,He cast: but meanwhile all the company
827,CANTO VI,"Go with the other; one before him runs,"
828,CANTO VI,"And one behind his mantle twitches, one"
829,CANTO VI,Fast by his side bids him remember him.
830,CANTO VI,"He stops not; and each one, to whom his hand"
831,CANTO VI,"Is stretch’d, well knows he bids him stand aside;"
832,CANTO VI,And thus he from the press defends himself.
833,CANTO VI,E’en such was I in that close-crowding throng;
834,CANTO VI,"And turning so my face around to all,"
835,CANTO VI,"And promising, I ’scap’d from it with pains."
836,CANTO VI,"Here of Arezzo him I saw, who fell"
837,CANTO VI,"By Ghino’s cruel arm; and him beside,"
838,CANTO VI,Who in his chase was swallow’d by the stream.
839,CANTO VI,"Here Frederic Novello, with his hand"
840,CANTO VI,"Stretch’d forth, entreated; and of Pisa he,"
841,CANTO VI,Who put the good Marzuco to such proof
842,CANTO VI,Of constancy. Count Orso I beheld;
843,CANTO VI,And from its frame a soul dismiss’d for spite
844,CANTO VI,"And envy, as it said, but for no crime:"
845,CANTO VI,"I speak of Peter de la Brosse; and here,"
846,CANTO VI,"While she yet lives, that Lady of Brabant"
847,CANTO VI,Let her beware; lest for so false a deed
848,CANTO VI,She herd with worse than these. When I was freed
849,CANTO VI,"From all those spirits, who pray’d for others’ prayers"
850,CANTO VI,To hasten on their state of blessedness;
851,CANTO VI,"Straight I began: “O thou, my luminary!"
852,CANTO VI,"It seems expressly in thy text denied,"
853,CANTO VI,That heaven’s supreme decree can never bend
854,CANTO VI,To supplication; yet with this design
855,CANTO VI,"Do these entreat. Can then their hope be vain,"
856,CANTO VI,Or is thy saying not to me reveal’d?”
857,CANTO VI,"He thus to me: “Both what I write is plain,"
858,CANTO VI,"And these deceiv’d not in their hope, if well"
859,CANTO VI,"Thy mind consider, that the sacred height"
860,CANTO VI,"Of judgment doth not stoop, because love’s flame"
861,CANTO VI,"In a short moment all fulfils, which he"
862,CANTO VI,"Who sojourns here, in right should satisfy."
863,CANTO VI,"Besides, when I this point concluded thus,"
864,CANTO VI,By praying no defect could be supplied;
865,CANTO VI,Because the pray’r had none access to God.
866,CANTO VI,Yet in this deep suspicion rest thou not
867,CANTO VI,"Contented unless she assure thee so,"
868,CANTO VI,Who betwixt truth and mind infuses light.
869,CANTO VI,I know not if thou take me right; I mean
870,CANTO VI,"Beatrice. Her thou shalt behold above,"
871,CANTO VI,"Upon this mountain’s crown, fair seat of joy.”"
872,CANTO VI,Then I: “Sir! let us mend our speed; for now
873,CANTO VI,I tire not as before; and lo! the hill
874,CANTO VI,Stretches its shadow far.” He answer’d thus:
875,CANTO VI,“Our progress with this day shall be as much
876,CANTO VI,As we may now dispatch; but otherwise
877,CANTO VI,Than thou supposest is the truth. For there
878,CANTO VI,"Thou canst not be, ere thou once more behold"
879,CANTO VI,"Him back returning, who behind the steep"
880,CANTO VI,"Is now so hidden, that as erst his beam"
881,CANTO VI,Thou dost not break. But lo! a spirit there
882,CANTO VI,"Stands solitary, and toward us looks:"
883,CANTO VI,It will instruct us in the speediest way.”
884,CANTO VI,We soon approach’d it. O thou Lombard spirit!
885,CANTO VI,"How didst thou stand, in high abstracted mood,"
886,CANTO VI,Scarce moving with slow dignity thine eyes!
887,CANTO VI,"It spoke not aught, but let us onward pass,"
888,CANTO VI,Eyeing us as a lion on his watch.
889,CANTO VI,"But Virgil with entreaty mild advanc’d,"
890,CANTO VI,Requesting it to show the best ascent.
891,CANTO VI,"It answer to his question none return’d,"
892,CANTO VI,But of our country and our kind of life
893,CANTO VI,"Demanded. When my courteous guide began,"
894,CANTO VI,"“Mantua,” the solitary shadow quick"
895,CANTO VI,"Rose towards us from the place in which it stood,"
896,CANTO VI,"And cry’d, “Mantuan! I am thy countryman"
897,CANTO VI,Sordello.” Each the other then embrac’d.
898,CANTO VI,"Ah slavish Italy! thou inn of grief,"
899,CANTO VI,"Vessel without a pilot in loud storm,"
900,CANTO VI,"Lady no longer of fair provinces,"
901,CANTO VI,"But brothel-house impure! this gentle spirit,"
902,CANTO VI,Ev’n from the Pleasant sound of his dear land
903,CANTO VI,Was prompt to greet a fellow citizen
904,CANTO VI,With such glad cheer; while now thy living ones
905,CANTO VI,In thee abide not without war; and one
906,CANTO VI,"Malicious gnaws another, ay of those"
907,CANTO VI,"Whom the same wall and the same moat contains,"
908,CANTO VI,"Seek, wretched one! around thy sea-coasts wide;"
909,CANTO VI,"Then homeward to thy bosom turn, and mark"
910,CANTO VI,If any part of the sweet peace enjoy.
911,CANTO VI,"What boots it, that thy reins Justinian’s hand"
912,CANTO VI,"Befitted, if thy saddle be unpress’d?"
913,CANTO VI,Nought doth he now but aggravate thy shame.
914,CANTO VI,"Ah people! thou obedient still shouldst live,"
915,CANTO VI,"And in the saddle let thy Caesar sit,"
916,CANTO VI,If well thou marked’st that which God commands.
917,CANTO VI,Look how that beast to felness hath relaps’d
918,CANTO VI,"From having lost correction of the spur,"
919,CANTO VI,"Since to the bridle thou hast set thine hand,"
920,CANTO VI,"O German Albert! who abandon’st her,"
921,CANTO VI,"That is grown savage and unmanageable,"
922,CANTO VI,When thou should’st clasp her flanks with forked heels.
923,CANTO VI,Just judgment from the stars fall on thy blood!
924,CANTO VI,And be it strange and manifest to all!
925,CANTO VI,Such as may strike thy successor with dread!
926,CANTO VI,"For that thy sire and thou have suffer’d thus,"
927,CANTO VI,"Through greediness of yonder realms detain’d,"
928,CANTO VI,The garden of the empire to run waste.
929,CANTO VI,"Come see the Capulets and Montagues,"
930,CANTO VI,The Philippeschi and Monaldi! man
931,CANTO VI,"Who car’st for nought! those sunk in grief, and these"
932,CANTO VI,"With dire suspicion rack’d. Come, cruel one!"
933,CANTO VI,"Come and behold the’ oppression of the nobles,"
934,CANTO VI,And mark their injuries: and thou mayst see.
935,CANTO VI,What safety Santafiore can supply.
936,CANTO VI,"Come and behold thy Rome, who calls on thee,"
937,CANTO VI,Desolate widow! day and night with moans:
938,CANTO VI,"“My Caesar, why dost thou desert my side?”"
939,CANTO VI,Come and behold what love among thy people:
940,CANTO VI,"And if no pity touches thee for us,"
941,CANTO VI,"Come and blush for thine own report. For me,"
942,CANTO VI,"If it be lawful, O Almighty Power,"
943,CANTO VI,Who wast in earth for our sakes crucified!
944,CANTO VI,Are thy just eyes turn’d elsewhere? or is this
945,CANTO VI,A preparation in the wond’rous depth
946,CANTO VI,"Of thy sage counsel made, for some good end,"
947,CANTO VI,Entirely from our reach of thought cut off?
948,CANTO VI,So are the’ Italian cities all o’erthrong’d
949,CANTO VI,"With tyrants, and a great Marcellus made"
950,CANTO VI,Of every petty factious villager.
951,CANTO VI,My Florence! thou mayst well remain unmov’d
952,CANTO VI,"At this digression, which affects not thee:"
953,CANTO VI,"Thanks to thy people, who so wisely speed."
954,CANTO VI,"Many have justice in their heart, that long"
955,CANTO VI,"Waiteth for counsel to direct the bow,"
956,CANTO VI,Or ere it dart unto its aim: but shine
957,CANTO VI,Have it on their lip’s edge. Many refuse
958,CANTO VI,To bear the common burdens: readier thine
959,CANTO VI,"Answer uneall’d, and cry, “Behold I stoop!”"
960,CANTO VI,"Make thyself glad, for thou hast reason now,"
961,CANTO VI,Thou wealthy! thou at peace! thou wisdom-fraught!
962,CANTO VI,Facts best witness if I speak the truth.
963,CANTO VI,"Athens and Lacedaemon, who of old"
964,CANTO VI,"Enacted laws, for civil arts renown’d,"
965,CANTO VI,Made little progress in improving life
966,CANTO VI,"Tow’rds thee, who usest such nice subtlety,"
967,CANTO VI,That to the middle of November scarce
968,CANTO VI,Reaches the thread thou in October weav’st.
969,CANTO VI,"How many times, within thy memory,"
970,CANTO VI,"Customs, and laws, and coins, and offices"
971,CANTO VI,"Have been by thee renew’d, and people chang’d!"
972,CANTO VI,"If thou remember’st well and can’st see clear,"
973,CANTO VI,"Thou wilt perceive thyself like a sick wretch,"
974,CANTO VI,"Who finds no rest upon her down, but oft"
975,CANTO VI,"Shifting her side, short respite seeks from pain."
976,CANTO VI,
977,CANTO VI,
978,CANTO VI,
979,CANTO VI,
980,CANTO VII,CANTO VII
981,CANTO VII,
982,CANTO VII,
983,CANTO VII,After their courteous greetings joyfully
984,CANTO VII,"Sev’n times exchang’d, Sordello backward drew"
985,CANTO VII,"Exclaiming, “Who are ye?” “Before this mount"
986,CANTO VII,By spirits worthy of ascent to God
987,CANTO VII,"Was sought, my bones had by Octavius’ care"
988,CANTO VII,"Been buried. I am Virgil, for no sin"
989,CANTO VII,"Depriv’d of heav’n, except for lack of faith.”"
990,CANTO VII,So answer’d him in few my gentle guide.
991,CANTO VII,"As one, who aught before him suddenly"
992,CANTO VII,"Beholding, whence his wonder riseth, cries"
993,CANTO VII,"“It is yet is not,” wav’ring in belief;"
994,CANTO VII,"Such he appear’d; then downward bent his eyes,"
995,CANTO VII,"And drawing near with reverential step,"
996,CANTO VII,"Caught him, where of mean estate might clasp"
997,CANTO VII,"His lord. “Glory of Latium!” he exclaim’d,"
998,CANTO VII,“In whom our tongue its utmost power display’d!
999,CANTO VII,Boast of my honor’d birth-place! what desert
1000,CANTO VII,"Of mine, what favour rather undeserv’d,"
1001,CANTO VII,Shows thee to me? If I to hear that voice
1002,CANTO VII,"Am worthy, say if from below thou com’st"
1003,CANTO VII,And from what cloister’s pale?”—“Through every orb
1004,CANTO VII,"Of that sad region,” he reply’d, “thus far"
1005,CANTO VII,"Am I arriv’d, by heav’nly influence led"
1006,CANTO VII,And with such aid I come. There is a place
1007,CANTO VII,"There underneath, not made by torments sad,"
1008,CANTO VII,But by dun shades alone; where mourning’s voice
1009,CANTO VII,"Sounds not of anguish sharp, but breathes in sighs.”"
1010,CANTO VII,
1011,CANTO VII,
1012,CANTO VII,"There I with little innocents abide,"
1013,CANTO VII,"Who by death’s fangs were bitten, ere exempt"
1014,CANTO VII,"From human taint. There I with those abide,"
1015,CANTO VII,"Who the three holy virtues put not on,"
1016,CANTO VII,"But understood the rest, and without blame"
1017,CANTO VII,"Follow’d them all. But if thou know’st and canst,"
1018,CANTO VII,"Direct us, how we soonest may arrive,"
1019,CANTO VII,Where Purgatory its true beginning takes.”
1020,CANTO VII,He answer’d thus: “We have no certain place
1021,CANTO VII,"Assign’d us: upwards I may go or round,"
1022,CANTO VII,"Far as I can, I join thee for thy guide."
1023,CANTO VII,But thou beholdest now how day declines:
1024,CANTO VII,"And upwards to proceed by night, our power"
1025,CANTO VII,Excels: therefore it may be well to choose
1026,CANTO VII,A place of pleasant sojourn. To the right
1027,CANTO VII,Some spirits sit apart retir’d. If thou
1028,CANTO VII,"Consentest, I to these will lead thy steps:"
1029,CANTO VII,"And thou wilt know them, not without delight.”"
1030,CANTO VII,“How chances this?” was answer’d; “who so wish’d
1031,CANTO VII,"To ascend by night, would he be thence debarr’d"
1032,CANTO VII,"By other, or through his own weakness fail?”"
1033,CANTO VII,"The good Sordello then, along the ground"
1034,CANTO VII,"Trailing his finger, spoke: “Only this line"
1035,CANTO VII,"Thou shalt not overpass, soon as the sun"
1036,CANTO VII,Hath disappear’d; not that aught else impedes
1037,CANTO VII,"Thy going upwards, save the shades of night."
1038,CANTO VII,These with the wont of power perplex the will.
1039,CANTO VII,"With them thou haply mightst return beneath,"
1040,CANTO VII,Or to and fro around the mountain’s side
1041,CANTO VII,"Wander, while day is in the horizon shut.”"
1042,CANTO VII,"My master straight, as wond’ring at his speech,"
1043,CANTO VII,"Exclaim’d: “Then lead us quickly, where thou sayst,"
1044,CANTO VII,"That, while we stay, we may enjoy delight.”"
1045,CANTO VII,"A little space we were remov’d from thence,"
1046,CANTO VII,When I perceiv’d the mountain hollow’d out.
1047,CANTO VII,"Ev’n as large valleys hollow’d out on earth,"
1048,CANTO VII,"“That way,” the’ escorting spirit cried, “we go,"
1049,CANTO VII,Where in a bosom the high bank recedes:
1050,CANTO VII,And thou await renewal of the day.”
1051,CANTO VII,Betwixt the steep and plain a crooked path
1052,CANTO VII,"Led us traverse into the ridge’s side,"
1053,CANTO VII,Where more than half the sloping edge expires.
1054,CANTO VII,"Refulgent gold, and silver thrice refin’d,"
1055,CANTO VII,"And scarlet grain and ceruse, Indian wood"
1056,CANTO VII,"Of lucid dye serene, fresh emeralds"
1057,CANTO VII,"But newly broken, by the herbs and flowers"
1058,CANTO VII,"Plac’d in that fair recess, in color all"
1059,CANTO VII,"Had been surpass’d, as great surpasses less."
1060,CANTO VII,"Nor nature only there lavish’d her hues,"
1061,CANTO VII,But of the sweetness of a thousand smells
1062,CANTO VII,A rare and undistinguish’d fragrance made.
1063,CANTO VII,
1064,CANTO VII,
1065,CANTO VII,"“Salve Regina,” on the grass and flowers"
1066,CANTO VII,Here chanting I beheld those spirits sit
1067,CANTO VII,Who not beyond the valley could be seen.
1068,CANTO VII,"“Before the west’ring sun sink to his bed,”"
1069,CANTO VII,"Began the Mantuan, who our steps had turn’d,"
1070,CANTO VII,“’Mid those desires not that I lead ye on.
1071,CANTO VII,For from this eminence ye shall discern
1072,CANTO VII,"Better the acts and visages of all,"
1073,CANTO VII,Than in the nether vale among them mix’d.
1074,CANTO VII,"He, who sits high above the rest, and seems"
1075,CANTO VII,"To have neglected that he should have done,"
1076,CANTO VII,"And to the others’ song moves not his lip,"
1077,CANTO VII,"The Emperor Rodolph call, who might have heal’d"
1078,CANTO VII,"The wounds whereof fair Italy hath died,"
1079,CANTO VII,"So that by others she revives but slowly,"
1080,CANTO VII,"He, who with kindly visage comforts him,"
1081,CANTO VII,"Sway’d in that country, where the water springs,"
1082,CANTO VII,"That Moldaw’s river to the Elbe, and Elbe"
1083,CANTO VII,Rolls to the ocean: Ottocar his name:
1084,CANTO VII,Who in his swaddling clothes was of more worth
1085,CANTO VII,"Than Winceslaus his son, a bearded man,"
1086,CANTO VII,Pamper’d with rank luxuriousness and ease.
1087,CANTO VII,"And that one with the nose depress, who close"
1088,CANTO VII,"In counsel seems with him of gentle look,"
1089,CANTO VII,"Flying expir’d, with’ring the lily’s flower."
1090,CANTO VII,Look there how he doth knock against his breast!
1091,CANTO VII,"The other ye behold, who for his cheek"
1092,CANTO VII,"Makes of one hand a couch, with frequent sighs."
1093,CANTO VII,They are the father and the father-in-law
1094,CANTO VII,Of Gallia’s bane: his vicious life they know
1095,CANTO VII,And foul; thence comes the grief that rends them thus.
1096,CANTO VII,"“He, so robust of limb, who measure keeps"
1097,CANTO VII,"In song, with him of feature prominent,"
1098,CANTO VII,With ev’ry virtue bore his girdle brac’d.
1099,CANTO VII,"And if that stripling who behinds him sits,"
1100,CANTO VII,"King after him had liv’d, his virtue then"
1101,CANTO VII,From vessel to like vessel had been pour’d;
1102,CANTO VII,Which may not of the other heirs be said.
1103,CANTO VII,By James and Frederick his realms are held;
1104,CANTO VII,Neither the better heritage obtains.
1105,CANTO VII,Rarely into the branches of the tree
1106,CANTO VII,Doth human worth mount up; and so ordains
1107,CANTO VII,"He who bestows it, that as his free gift"
1108,CANTO VII,It may be call’d. To Charles my words apply
1109,CANTO VII,No less than to his brother in the song;
1110,CANTO VII,Which Pouille and Provence now with grief confess.
1111,CANTO VII,"So much that plant degenerates from its seed,"
1112,CANTO VII,As more than Beatrice and Margaret
1113,CANTO VII,Costanza still boasts of her valorous spouse.
1114,CANTO VII,"“Behold the king of simple life and plain,"
1115,CANTO VII,"Harry of England, sitting there alone:"
1116,CANTO VII,He through his branches better issue spreads.
1117,CANTO VII,"“That one, who on the ground beneath the rest"
1118,CANTO VII,"Sits lowest, yet his gaze directs aloft,"
1119,CANTO VII,"Us William, that brave Marquis, for whose cause"
1120,CANTO VII,The deed of Alexandria and his war
1121,CANTO VII,Makes Conferrat and Canavese weep.”
1122,CANTO VII,
1123,CANTO VII,
1124,CANTO VII,
1125,CANTO VII,
1126,CANTO VIII,CANTO VIII
1127,CANTO VIII,
1128,CANTO VIII,
1129,CANTO VIII,Now was the hour that wakens fond desire
1130,CANTO VIII,"In men at sea, and melts their thoughtful heart,"
1131,CANTO VIII,"Who in the morn have bid sweet friends farewell,"
1132,CANTO VIII,And pilgrim newly on his road with love
1133,CANTO VIII,"Thrills, if he hear the vesper bell from far,"
1134,CANTO VIII,That seems to mourn for the expiring day:
1135,CANTO VIII,"When I, no longer taking heed to hear"
1136,CANTO VIII,"Began, with wonder, from those spirits to mark"
1137,CANTO VIII,"One risen from its seat, which with its hand"
1138,CANTO VIII,"Audience implor’d. Both palms it join’d and rais’d,"
1139,CANTO VIII,"Fixing its steadfast gaze towards the east,"
1140,CANTO VIII,"As telling God, “I care for naught beside.”"
1141,CANTO VIII,"“Te Lucis Ante,” so devoutly then"
1142,CANTO VIII,"Came from its lip, and in so soft a strain,"
1143,CANTO VIII,That all my sense in ravishment was lost.
1144,CANTO VIII,"And the rest after, softly and devout,"
1145,CANTO VIII,"Follow’d through all the hymn, with upward gaze"
1146,CANTO VIII,Directed to the bright supernal wheels.
1147,CANTO VIII,"Here, reader! for the truth makes thine eyes keen:"
1148,CANTO VIII,"For of so subtle texture is this veil,"
1149,CANTO VIII,That thou with ease mayst pass it through unmark’d.
1150,CANTO VIII,I saw that gentle band silently next
1151,CANTO VIII,"Look up, as if in expectation held,"
1152,CANTO VIII,Pale and in lowly guise; and from on high
1153,CANTO VIII,I saw forth issuing descend beneath
1154,CANTO VIII,"Two angels with two flame-illumin’d swords,"
1155,CANTO VIII,Broken and mutilated at their points.
1156,CANTO VIII,"Green as the tender leaves but newly born,"
1157,CANTO VIII,"Their vesture was, the which by wings as green"
1158,CANTO VIII,"Beaten, they drew behind them, fann’d in air."
1159,CANTO VIII,"A little over us one took his stand,"
1160,CANTO VIII,"The other lighted on the’ Opposing hill,"
1161,CANTO VIII,So that the troop were in the midst contain’d.
1162,CANTO VIII,Well I descried the whiteness on their heads;
1163,CANTO VIII,But in their visages the dazzled eye
1164,CANTO VIII,"Was lost, as faculty that by too much"
1165,CANTO VIII,Is overpower’d. “From Mary’s bosom both
1166,CANTO VIII,"Are come,” exclaim’d Sordello, “as a guard"
1167,CANTO VIII,"Over the vale, ganst him, who hither tends,"
1168,CANTO VIII,"The serpent.” Whence, not knowing by which path"
1169,CANTO VIII,"He came, I turn’d me round, and closely press’d,"
1170,CANTO VIII,"All frozen, to my leader’s trusted side."
1171,CANTO VIII,Sordello paus’d not: “To the valley now
1172,CANTO VIII,(For it is time) let us descend; and hold
1173,CANTO VIII,Converse with those great shadows: haply much
1174,CANTO VIII,Their sight may please ye.” Only three steps down
1175,CANTO VIII,"Methinks I measur’d, ere I was beneath,"
1176,CANTO VIII,And noted one who look’d as with desire
1177,CANTO VIII,To know me. Time was now that air arrow dim;
1178,CANTO VIII,"Yet not so dim, that ’twixt his eyes and mine"
1179,CANTO VIII,It clear’d not up what was conceal’d before.
1180,CANTO VIII,Mutually tow’rds each other we advanc’d.
1181,CANTO VIII,"Nino, thou courteous judge! what joy I felt,"
1182,CANTO VIII,When I perceiv’d thou wert not with the bad!
1183,CANTO VIII,No salutation kind on either part
1184,CANTO VIII,Was left unsaid. He then inquir’d: “How long
1185,CANTO VIII,"Since thou arrived’st at the mountain’s foot,"
1186,CANTO VIII,"Over the distant waves?”—“O!” answer’d I,"
1187,CANTO VIII,"“Through the sad seats of woe this morn I came,"
1188,CANTO VIII,"And still in my first life, thus journeying on,"
1189,CANTO VIII,The other strive to gain.” Soon as they heard
1190,CANTO VIII,"My words, he and Sordello backward drew,"
1191,CANTO VIII,"As suddenly amaz’d. To Virgil one,"
1192,CANTO VIII,"The other to a spirit turn’d, who near"
1193,CANTO VIII,"Was seated, crying: “Conrad! up with speed:"
1194,CANTO VIII,"Come, see what of his grace high God hath will’d.”"
1195,CANTO VIII,Then turning round to me: “By that rare mark
1196,CANTO VIII,"Of honour which thou ow’st to him, who hides"
1197,CANTO VIII,"So deeply his first cause, it hath no ford,"
1198,CANTO VIII,When thou shalt be beyond the vast of waves.
1199,CANTO VIII,"Tell my Giovanna, that for me she call"
1200,CANTO VIII,"There, where reply to innocence is made."
1201,CANTO VIII,"Her mother, I believe, loves me no more;"
1202,CANTO VIII,"Since she has chang’d the white and wimpled folds,"
1203,CANTO VIII,Which she is doom’d once more with grief to wish.
1204,CANTO VIII,"By her it easily may be perceiv’d,"
1205,CANTO VIII,"How long in women lasts the flame of love,"
1206,CANTO VIII,If sight and touch do not relume it oft.
1207,CANTO VIII,For her so fair a burial will not make
1208,CANTO VIII,"The viper which calls Milan to the field,"
1209,CANTO VIII,As had been made by shrill Gallura’s bird.”
1210,CANTO VIII,"He spoke, and in his visage took the stamp"
1211,CANTO VIII,"Of that right seal, which with due temperature"
1212,CANTO VIII,Glows in the bosom. My insatiate eyes
1213,CANTO VIII,"Meanwhile to heav’n had travel’d, even there"
1214,CANTO VIII,"Where the bright stars are slowest, as a wheel"
1215,CANTO VIII,Nearest the axle; when my guide inquir’d:
1216,CANTO VIII,"“What there aloft, my son, has caught thy gaze?”"
1217,CANTO VIII,"I answer’d: “The three torches, with which here"
1218,CANTO VIII,The pole is all on fire.” He then to me:
1219,CANTO VIII,"“The four resplendent stars, thou saw’st this morn"
1220,CANTO VIII,"Are there beneath, and these ris’n in their stead.”"
1221,CANTO VIII,While yet he spoke. Sordello to himself
1222,CANTO VIII,"Drew him, and cry’d: “Lo there our enemy!”"
1223,CANTO VIII,And with his hand pointed that way to look.
1224,CANTO VIII,"Along the side, where barrier none arose"
1225,CANTO VIII,"Around the little vale, a serpent lay,"
1226,CANTO VIII,Such haply as gave Eve the bitter food.
1227,CANTO VIII,"Between the grass and flowers, the evil snake"
1228,CANTO VIII,"Came on, reverting oft his lifted head;"
1229,CANTO VIII,"And, as a beast that smoothes its polish’d coat,"
1230,CANTO VIII,"Licking his hack. I saw not, nor can tell,"
1231,CANTO VIII,How those celestial falcons from their seat
1232,CANTO VIII,"Mov’d, but in motion each one well descried,"
1233,CANTO VIII,Hearing the air cut by their verdant plumes.
1234,CANTO VIII,The serpent fled; and to their stations back
1235,CANTO VIII,The angels up return’d with equal flight.
1236,CANTO VIII,
1237,CANTO VIII,
1238,CANTO VIII,"The Spirit (who to Nino, when he call’d,"
1239,CANTO VIII,"Had come), from viewing me with fixed ken,"
1240,CANTO VIII,"Through all that conflict, loosen’d not his sight."
1241,CANTO VIII,"“So may the lamp, which leads thee up on high,"
1242,CANTO VIII,"Find, in thy destin’d lot, of wax so much,"
1243,CANTO VIII,As may suffice thee to the enamel’s height.”
1244,CANTO VIII,It thus began: “If any certain news
1245,CANTO VIII,Of Valdimagra and the neighbour part
1246,CANTO VIII,"Thou know’st, tell me, who once was mighty there"
1247,CANTO VIII,"They call’d me Conrad Malaspina, not"
1248,CANTO VIII,"That old one, but from him I sprang. The love"
1249,CANTO VIII,I bore my people is now here refin’d.”
1250,CANTO VIII,"“In your dominions,” I answer’d, “ne’er was I."
1251,CANTO VIII,"But through all Europe where do those men dwell,"
1252,CANTO VIII,To whom their glory is not manifest?
1253,CANTO VIII,"The fame, that honours your illustrious house,"
1254,CANTO VIII,Proclaims the nobles and proclaims the land;
1255,CANTO VIII,So that he knows it who was never there.
1256,CANTO VIII,"I swear to you, so may my upward route"
1257,CANTO VIII,Prosper! your honour’d nation not impairs
1258,CANTO VIII,The value of her coffer and her sword.
1259,CANTO VIII,"Nature and use give her such privilege,"
1260,CANTO VIII,That while the world is twisted from his course
1261,CANTO VIII,"By a bad head, she only walks aright,"
1262,CANTO VIII,And has the evil way in scorn.” He then:
1263,CANTO VIII,“Now pass thee on: sev’n times the tired sun
1264,CANTO VIII,"Revisits not the couch, which with four feet"
1265,CANTO VIII,"The forked Aries covers, ere that kind"
1266,CANTO VIII,Opinion shall be nail’d into thy brain
1267,CANTO VIII,"With stronger nails than other’s speech can drive,"
1268,CANTO VIII,If the sure course of judgment be not stay’d.”
1269,CANTO VIII,
1270,CANTO VIII,
1271,CANTO VIII,
1272,CANTO VIII,
1273,CANTO IX,CANTO IX
1274,CANTO IX,
1275,CANTO IX,
1276,CANTO IX,"Now the fair consort of Tithonus old,"
1277,CANTO IX,"Arisen from her mate’s beloved arms,"
1278,CANTO IX,"Look’d palely o’er the eastern cliff: her brow,"
1279,CANTO IX,"Lucent with jewels, glitter’d, set in sign"
1280,CANTO IX,"Of that chill animal, who with his train"
1281,CANTO IX,"Smites fearful nations: and where then we were,"
1282,CANTO IX,"Two steps of her ascent the night had past,"
1283,CANTO IX,"And now the third was closing up its wing,"
1284,CANTO IX,"When I, who had so much of Adam with me,"
1285,CANTO IX,"Sank down upon the grass, o’ercome with sleep,"
1286,CANTO IX,"There where all five were seated. In that hour,"
1287,CANTO IX,"When near the dawn the swallow her sad lay,"
1288,CANTO IX,"Rememb’ring haply ancient grief, renews,"
1289,CANTO IX,"And with our minds more wand’rers from the flesh,"
1290,CANTO IX,"And less by thought restrain’d are, as ’t were, full"
1291,CANTO IX,"Of holy divination in their dreams,"
1292,CANTO IX,Then in a vision did I seem to view
1293,CANTO IX,"A golden-feather’d eagle in the sky,"
1294,CANTO IX,"With open wings, and hov’ring for descent,"
1295,CANTO IX,"And I was in that place, methought, from whence"
1296,CANTO IX,"Young Ganymede, from his associates ’reft,"
1297,CANTO IX,Was snatch’d aloft to the high consistory.
1298,CANTO IX,"“Perhaps,” thought I within me, “here alone"
1299,CANTO IX,"He strikes his quarry, and elsewhere disdains"
1300,CANTO IX,"To pounce upon the prey.” Therewith, it seem’d,"
1301,CANTO IX,A little wheeling in his airy tour
1302,CANTO IX,"Terrible as the lightning rush’d he down,"
1303,CANTO IX,And snatch’d me upward even to the fire.
1304,CANTO IX,
1305,CANTO IX,
1306,CANTO IX,"There both, I thought, the eagle and myself"
1307,CANTO IX,"Did burn; and so intense th’ imagin’d flames,"
1308,CANTO IX,That needs my sleep was broken off. As erst
1309,CANTO IX,"Achilles shook himself, and round him roll’d"
1310,CANTO IX,"His waken’d eyeballs wond’ring where he was,"
1311,CANTO IX,Whenas his mother had from Chiron fled
1312,CANTO IX,"To Scyros, with him sleeping in her arms;"
1313,CANTO IX,"E’en thus I shook me, soon as from my face"
1314,CANTO IX,"The slumber parted, turning deadly pale,"
1315,CANTO IX,Like one ice-struck with dread. Solo at my side
1316,CANTO IX,My comfort stood: and the bright sun was now
1317,CANTO IX,More than two hours aloft: and to the sea
1318,CANTO IX,"My looks were turn’d. “Fear not,” my master cried,"
1319,CANTO IX,“Assur’d we are at happy point. Thy strength
1320,CANTO IX,"Shrink not, but rise dilated. Thou art come"
1321,CANTO IX,To Purgatory now. Lo! there the cliff
1322,CANTO IX,"That circling bounds it! Lo! the entrance there,"
1323,CANTO IX,Where it doth seem disparted! Ere the dawn
1324,CANTO IX,"Usher’d the daylight, when thy wearied soul"
1325,CANTO IX,"Slept in thee, o’er the flowery vale beneath"
1326,CANTO IX,"A lady came, and thus bespake me: I"
1327,CANTO IX,"Am Lucia. Suffer me to take this man,"
1328,CANTO IX,Who slumbers. Easier so his way shall speed.”
1329,CANTO IX,Sordello and the other gentle shapes
1330,CANTO IX,"Tarrying, she bare thee up: and, as day shone,"
1331,CANTO IX,This summit reach’d: and I pursued her steps.
1332,CANTO IX,Here did she place thee. First her lovely eyes
1333,CANTO IX,That open entrance show’d me; then at once
1334,CANTO IX,"She vanish’d with thy sleep.” Like one, whose doubts"
1335,CANTO IX,"Are chas’d by certainty, and terror turn’d"
1336,CANTO IX,"To comfort on discovery of the truth,"
1337,CANTO IX,Such was the change in me: and as my guide
1338,CANTO IX,"Beheld me fearless, up along the cliff"
1339,CANTO IX,"He mov’d, and I behind him, towards the height."
1340,CANTO IX,"Reader! thou markest how my theme doth rise,"
1341,CANTO IX,"Nor wonder therefore, if more artfully"
1342,CANTO IX,"I prop the structure! Nearer now we drew,"
1343,CANTO IX,"Arriv’d’ whence in that part, where first a breach"
1344,CANTO IX,"As of a wall appear’d, I could descry"
1345,CANTO IX,"A portal, and three steps beneath, that led"
1346,CANTO IX,"For inlet there, of different colour each,"
1347,CANTO IX,"And one who watch’d, but spake not yet a word."
1348,CANTO IX,"As more and more mine eye did stretch its view,"
1349,CANTO IX,"I mark’d him seated on the highest step,"
1350,CANTO IX,"In visage such, as past my power to bear."
1351,CANTO IX,
1352,CANTO IX,
1353,CANTO IX,"Grasp’d in his hand a naked sword, glanc’d back"
1354,CANTO IX,"The rays so toward me, that I oft in vain"
1355,CANTO IX,My sight directed. “Speak from whence ye stand:”
1356,CANTO IX,He cried: “What would ye? Where is your escort?
1357,CANTO IX,Take heed your coming upward harm ye not.”
1358,CANTO IX,"“A heavenly dame, not skilless of these things,”"
1359,CANTO IX,"Replied the’ instructor, “told us, even now,"
1360,CANTO IX,‘Pass that way: here the gate is.”—“And may she
1361,CANTO IX,"Befriending prosper your ascent,” resum’d"
1362,CANTO IX,The courteous keeper of the gate: “Come then
1363,CANTO IX,Before our steps.” We straightway thither came.
1364,CANTO IX,The lowest stair was marble white so smooth
1365,CANTO IX,"And polish’d, that therein my mirror’d form"
1366,CANTO IX,Distinct I saw. The next of hue more dark
1367,CANTO IX,"Than sablest grain, a rough and singed block,"
1368,CANTO IX,"Crack’d lengthwise and across. The third, that lay"
1369,CANTO IX,"Massy above, seem’d porphyry, that flam’d"
1370,CANTO IX,Red as the life-blood spouting from a vein.
1371,CANTO IX,"On this God’s angel either foot sustain’d,"
1372,CANTO IX,"Upon the threshold seated, which appear’d"
1373,CANTO IX,A rock of diamond. Up the trinal steps
1374,CANTO IX,"My leader cheerily drew me. “Ask,” said he,"
1375,CANTO IX,"“With humble heart, that he unbar the bolt.”"
1376,CANTO IX,Piously at his holy feet devolv’d
1377,CANTO IX,"I cast me, praying him for pity’s sake"
1378,CANTO IX,That he would open to me: but first fell
1379,CANTO IX,Thrice on my bosom prostrate. Seven times
1380,CANTO IX,"The letter, that denotes the inward stain,"
1381,CANTO IX,He on my forehead with the blunted point
1382,CANTO IX,"Of his drawn sword inscrib’d. And “Look,” he cried,"
1383,CANTO IX,"“When enter’d, that thou wash these scars away.”"
1384,CANTO IX,"Ashes, or earth ta’en dry out of the ground,"
1385,CANTO IX,Were of one colour with the robe he wore.
1386,CANTO IX,From underneath that vestment forth he drew
1387,CANTO IX,"Two keys of metal twain: the one was gold,"
1388,CANTO IX,"Its fellow silver. With the pallid first,"
1389,CANTO IX,"And next the burnish’d, he so ply’d the gate,"
1390,CANTO IX,As to content me well. “Whenever one
1391,CANTO IX,"Faileth of these, that in the keyhole straight"
1392,CANTO IX,"It turn not, to this alley then expect"
1393,CANTO IX,Access in vain.” Such were the words he spake.
1394,CANTO IX,“One is more precious: but the other needs
1395,CANTO IX,"Skill and sagacity, large share of each,"
1396,CANTO IX,Ere its good task to disengage the knot
1397,CANTO IX,Be worthily perform’d. From Peter these
1398,CANTO IX,"I hold, of him instructed, that I err"
1399,CANTO IX,Rather in opening than in keeping fast;
1400,CANTO IX,So but the suppliant at my feet implore.”
1401,CANTO IX,"Then of that hallow’d gate he thrust the door,"
1402,CANTO IX,"Exclaiming, “Enter, but this warning hear:"
1403,CANTO IX,He forth again departs who looks behind.”
1404,CANTO IX,As in the hinges of that sacred ward
1405,CANTO IX,"The swivels turn’d, sonorous metal strong,"
1406,CANTO IX,Harsh was the grating; nor so surlily
1407,CANTO IX,"Roar’d the Tarpeian, when by force bereft"
1408,CANTO IX,"Of good Metellus, thenceforth from his loss"
1409,CANTO IX,"To leanness doom’d. Attentively I turn’d,"
1410,CANTO IX,"List’ning the thunder, that first issued forth;"
1411,CANTO IX,"And “We praise thee, O God,” methought I heard"
1412,CANTO IX,In accents blended with sweet melody.
1413,CANTO IX,"The strains came o’er mine ear, e’en as the sound"
1414,CANTO IX,"Of choral voices, that in solemn chant"
1415,CANTO IX,"With organ mingle, and, now high and clear,"
1416,CANTO IX,"Come swelling, now float indistinct away."
1417,CANTO IX,
1418,CANTO IX,
1419,CANTO IX,
1420,CANTO IX,
1421,CANTO X,CANTO X
1422,CANTO X,
1423,CANTO X,
1424,CANTO X,When we had passed the threshold of the gate
1425,CANTO X,"(Which the soul’s ill affection doth disuse,"
1426,CANTO X,"Making the crooked seem the straighter path),"
1427,CANTO X,"I heard its closing sound. Had mine eyes turn’d,"
1428,CANTO X,For that offence what plea might have avail’d?
1429,CANTO X,"We mounted up the riven rock, that wound"
1430,CANTO X,"On either side alternate, as the wave"
1431,CANTO X,Flies and advances. “Here some little art
1432,CANTO X,"Behooves us,” said my leader, “that our steps"
1433,CANTO X,Observe the varying flexure of the path.”
1434,CANTO X,"Thus we so slowly sped, that with cleft orb"
1435,CANTO X,"The moon once more o’erhangs her wat’ry couch,"
1436,CANTO X,Ere we that strait have threaded. But when free
1437,CANTO X,"We came and open, where the mount above"
1438,CANTO X,"One solid mass retires, I spent, with toil,"
1439,CANTO X,"And both, uncertain of the way, we stood,"
1440,CANTO X,"Upon a plain more lonesome, than the roads"
1441,CANTO X,That traverse desert wilds. From whence the brink
1442,CANTO X,"Borders upon vacuity, to foot"
1443,CANTO X,"Of the steep bank, that rises still, the space"
1444,CANTO X,Had measur’d thrice the stature of a man:
1445,CANTO X,"And, distant as mine eye could wing its flight,"
1446,CANTO X,"To leftward now and now to right dispatch’d,"
1447,CANTO X,That cornice equal in extent appear’d.
1448,CANTO X,"Not yet our feet had on that summit mov’d,"
1449,CANTO X,"When I discover’d that the bank around,"
1450,CANTO X,"Whose proud uprising all ascent denied,"
1451,CANTO X,"Was marble white, and so exactly wrought"
1452,CANTO X,"With quaintest sculpture, that not there alone"
1453,CANTO X,"Had Polycletus, but e’en nature’s self"
1454,CANTO X,Been sham’d. The angel who came down to earth
1455,CANTO X,With tidings of the peace so many years
1456,CANTO X,"Wept for in vain, that op’d the heavenly gates"
1457,CANTO X,"From their long interdict before us seem’d,"
1458,CANTO X,"In a sweet act, so sculptur’d to the life,"
1459,CANTO X,He look’d no silent image. One had sworn
1460,CANTO X,"He had said, “Hail!” for she was imag’d there,"
1461,CANTO X,"By whom the key did open to God’s love,"
1462,CANTO X,And in her act as sensibly impress
1463,CANTO X,"That word, “Behold the handmaid of the Lord,”"
1464,CANTO X,As figure seal’d on wax. “Fix not thy mind
1465,CANTO X,"On one place only,” said the guide belov’d,"
1466,CANTO X,Who had me near him on that part where lies
1467,CANTO X,The heart of man. My sight forthwith I turn’d
1468,CANTO X,"And mark’d, behind the virgin mother’s form,"
1469,CANTO X,"Upon that side, where he, that mov’d me, stood,"
1470,CANTO X,Another story graven on the rock.
1471,CANTO X,"I passed athwart the bard, and drew me near,"
1472,CANTO X,That it might stand more aptly for my view.
1473,CANTO X,There in the self-same marble were engrav’d
1474,CANTO X,"The cart and kine, drawing the sacred ark,"
1475,CANTO X,That from unbidden office awes mankind.
1476,CANTO X,Before it came much people; and the whole
1477,CANTO X,"Parted in seven quires. One sense cried, “Nay,”"
1478,CANTO X,"Another, “Yes, they sing.” Like doubt arose"
1479,CANTO X,"Betwixt the eye and smell, from the curl’d fume"
1480,CANTO X,Of incense breathing up the well-wrought toil.
1481,CANTO X,"Preceding the blest vessel, onward came"
1482,CANTO X,"With light dance leaping, girt in humble guise,"
1483,CANTO X,Sweet Israel’s harper: in that hap he seem’d
1484,CANTO X,"Less and yet more than kingly. Opposite,"
1485,CANTO X,"At a great palace, from the lattice forth"
1486,CANTO X,"Look’d Michol, like a lady full of scorn"
1487,CANTO X,"And sorrow. To behold the tablet next,"
1488,CANTO X,"Which at the hack of Michol whitely shone,"
1489,CANTO X,I mov’d me. There was storied on the rock
1490,CANTO X,"The’ exalted glory of the Roman prince,"
1491,CANTO X,Whose mighty worth mov’d Gregory to earn
1492,CANTO X,"His mighty conquest, Trajan th’ Emperor."
1493,CANTO X,"A widow at his bridle stood, attir’d"
1494,CANTO X,In tears and mourning. Round about them troop’d
1495,CANTO X,"Full throng of knights, and overhead in gold"
1496,CANTO X,"The eagles floated, struggling with the wind."
1497,CANTO X,
1498,CANTO X,
1499,CANTO X,The wretch appear’d amid all these to say:
1500,CANTO X,"“Grant vengeance, sire! for, woe beshrew this heart"
1501,CANTO X,My son is murder’d.” He replying seem’d;
1502,CANTO X,"“Wait now till I return.” And she, as one"
1503,CANTO X,"Made hasty by her grief; “O sire, if thou"
1504,CANTO X,"Dost not return?”—“Where I am, who then is,"
1505,CANTO X,"May right thee.”—“What to thee is other’s good,"
1506,CANTO X,"If thou neglect thy own?”—“Now comfort thee,”"
1507,CANTO X,At length he answers. “It beseemeth well
1508,CANTO X,"My duty be perform’d, ere I move hence:"
1509,CANTO X,So justice wills; and pity bids me stay.”
1510,CANTO X,"He, whose ken nothing new surveys, produc’d"
1511,CANTO X,"That visible speaking, new to us and strange"
1512,CANTO X,The like not found on earth. Fondly I gaz’d
1513,CANTO X,"Upon those patterns of meek humbleness,"
1514,CANTO X,"Shapes yet more precious for their artist’s sake,"
1515,CANTO X,"When “Lo,” the poet whisper’d, “where this way"
1516,CANTO X,"(But slack their pace), a multitude advance."
1517,CANTO X,These to the lofty steps shall guide us on.”
1518,CANTO X,"Mine eyes, though bent on view of novel sights"
1519,CANTO X,"Their lov’d allurement, were not slow to turn."
1520,CANTO X,Reader! I would not that amaz’d thou miss
1521,CANTO X,"Of thy good purpose, hearing how just God"
1522,CANTO X,Decrees our debts be cancel’d. Ponder not
1523,CANTO X,"The form of suff’ring. Think on what succeeds,"
1524,CANTO X,Think that at worst beyond the mighty doom
1525,CANTO X,"It cannot pass. “Instructor,” I began,"
1526,CANTO X,"“What I see hither tending, bears no trace"
1527,CANTO X,"Of human semblance, nor of aught beside"
1528,CANTO X,That my foil’d sight can guess.” He answering thus:
1529,CANTO X,"“So courb’d to earth, beneath their heavy teems"
1530,CANTO X,"Of torment stoop they, that mine eye at first"
1531,CANTO X,"Struggled as thine. But look intently thither,"
1532,CANTO X,"An disentangle with thy lab’ring view,"
1533,CANTO X,"What underneath those stones approacheth: now,"
1534,CANTO X,"E’en now, mayst thou discern the pangs of each.”"
1535,CANTO X,Christians and proud! O poor and wretched ones!
1536,CANTO X,"That feeble in the mind’s eye, lean your trust"
1537,CANTO X,Upon unstaid perverseness! Know ye not
1538,CANTO X,"That we are worms, yet made at last to form"
1539,CANTO X,"The winged insect, imp’d with angel plumes"
1540,CANTO X,That to heaven’s justice unobstructed soars?
1541,CANTO X,Why buoy ye up aloft your unfleg’d souls?
1542,CANTO X,"Abortive then and shapeless ye remain,"
1543,CANTO X,Like the untimely embryon of a worm!
1544,CANTO X,"As, to support incumbent floor or roof,"
1545,CANTO X,"For corbel is a figure sometimes seen,"
1546,CANTO X,"That crumples up its knees unto its breast,"
1547,CANTO X,With the feign’d posture stirring ruth unfeign’d
1548,CANTO X,In the beholder’s fancy; so I saw
1549,CANTO X,"These fashion’d, when I noted well their guise."
1550,CANTO X,"Each, as his back was laden, came indeed"
1551,CANTO X,Or more or less contract; but it appear’d
1552,CANTO X,"As he, who show’d most patience in his look,"
1553,CANTO X,Wailing exclaim’d: “I can endure no more.”

1561,CANTO XI,"“O thou Almighty Father, who dost make"
1562,CANTO XI,"The heavens thy dwelling, not in bounds confin’d,"
1563,CANTO XI,But that with love intenser there thou view’st
1564,CANTO XI,"Thy primal effluence, hallow’d be thy name:"
1565,CANTO XI,Join each created being to extol
1566,CANTO XI,"Thy might, for worthy humblest thanks and praise"
1567,CANTO XI,Is thy blest Spirit. May thy kingdom’s peace
1568,CANTO XI,"Come unto us; for we, unless it come,"
1569,CANTO XI,With all our striving thither tend in vain.
1570,CANTO XI,As of their will the angels unto thee
1571,CANTO XI,"Tender meet sacrifice, circling thy throne"
1572,CANTO XI,"With loud hosannas, so of theirs be done"
1573,CANTO XI,By saintly men on earth. Grant us this day
1574,CANTO XI,"Our daily manna, without which he roams"
1575,CANTO XI,"Through this rough desert retrograde, who most"
1576,CANTO XI,Toils to advance his steps. As we to each
1577,CANTO XI,"Pardon the evil done us, pardon thou"
1578,CANTO XI,"Benign, and of our merit take no count."
1579,CANTO XI,’Gainst the old adversary prove thou not
1580,CANTO XI,Our virtue easily subdu’d; but free
1581,CANTO XI,From his incitements and defeat his wiles.
1582,CANTO XI,"This last petition, dearest Lord! is made"
1583,CANTO XI,"Not for ourselves, since that were needless now,"
1584,CANTO XI,But for their sakes who after us remain.”
1585,CANTO XI,
1586,CANTO XI,"Thus for themselves and us good speed imploring,"
1587,CANTO XI,Those spirits went beneath a weight like that
1588,CANTO XI,"We sometimes feel in dreams, all, sore beset,"
1589,CANTO XI,"But with unequal anguish, wearied all,"
1590,CANTO XI,"Round the first circuit, purging as they go,"
1591,CANTO XI,The world’s gross darkness off: In our behalf
1592,CANTO XI,"If there vows still be offer’d, what can here"
1593,CANTO XI,"For them be vow’d and done by such, whose wills"
1594,CANTO XI,Have root of goodness in them? Well beseems
1595,CANTO XI,That we should help them wash away the stains
1596,CANTO XI,"They carried hence, that so made pure and light,"
1597,CANTO XI,They may spring upward to the starry spheres.
1598,CANTO XI,
1599,CANTO XI,“Ah! so may mercy-temper’d justice rid

1605,CANTO XI,Instruct us of that easiest to ascend;

1607,CANTO XI,"The charge of fleshly raiment Adam left him,"
1608,CANTO XI,Despite his better will but slowly mounts.”
1609,CANTO XI,"From whom the answer came unto these words,"
1610,CANTO XI,"Which my guide spake, appear’d not; but ’twas said."
1611,CANTO XI,
1612,CANTO XI,"“Along the bank to rightward come with us,"
1613,CANTO XI,And ye shall find a pass that mocks not toil
1614,CANTO XI,Of living man to climb: and were it not
1615,CANTO XI,"That I am hinder’d by the rock, wherewith"
1616,CANTO XI,"This arrogant neck is tam’d, whence needs I stoop"
1617,CANTO XI,"My visage to the ground, him, who yet lives,"
1618,CANTO XI,Whose name thou speak’st not him I fain would view.
1619,CANTO XI,To mark if e’er I knew him? and to crave
1620,CANTO XI,His pity for the fardel that I bear.
1621,CANTO XI,"I was of Latiun, of a Tuscan horn"
1622,CANTO XI,A mighty one: Aldobranlesco’s name
1623,CANTO XI,"My sire’s, I know not if ye e’er have heard."
1624,CANTO XI,My old blood and forefathers’ gallant deeds
1625,CANTO XI,"Made me so haughty, that I clean forgot"
1626,CANTO XI,"The common mother, and to such excess,"
1627,CANTO XI,"Wax’d in my scorn of all men, that I fell,"
1628,CANTO XI,"Fell therefore; by what fate Sienna’s sons,"
1629,CANTO XI,"Each child in Campagnatico, can tell."
1630,CANTO XI,I am Omberto; not me only pride
1631,CANTO XI,"Hath injur’d, but my kindred all involv’d"
1632,CANTO XI,In mischief with her. Here my lot ordains
1633,CANTO XI,"Under this weight to groan, till I appease"
1634,CANTO XI,"God’s angry justice, since I did it not"
1635,CANTO XI,"Amongst the living, here amongst the dead.”"
1636,CANTO XI,
1637,CANTO XI,List’ning I bent my visage down: and one
1638,CANTO XI,(Not he who spake) twisted beneath the weight
1639,CANTO XI,"That urg’d him, saw me, knew me straight, and call’d,"
1640,CANTO XI,Holding his eyes With difficulty fix’d
1641,CANTO XI,"Intent upon me, stooping as I went"
1642,CANTO XI,"Companion of their way. “O!” I exclaim’d,"
1643,CANTO XI,
1644,CANTO XI,"“Art thou not Oderigi, art not thou"
1645,CANTO XI,"Agobbio’s glory, glory of that art"
1646,CANTO XI,Which they of Paris call the limmer’s skill?”
1647,CANTO XI,
1648,CANTO XI,"“Brother!” said he, “with tints that gayer smile,"
1649,CANTO XI,Bolognian Franco’s pencil lines the leaves.
1650,CANTO XI,His all the honour now; mine borrow’d light.
1651,CANTO XI,"In truth I had not been thus courteous to him,"
1652,CANTO XI,"The whilst I liv’d, through eagerness of zeal"
1653,CANTO XI,For that pre-eminence my heart was bent on.
1654,CANTO XI,Here of such pride the forfeiture is paid.
1655,CANTO XI,"Nor were I even here; if, able still"
1656,CANTO XI,"To sin, I had not turn’d me unto God."
1657,CANTO XI,"O powers of man! how vain your glory, nipp’d"
1658,CANTO XI,"E’en in its height of verdure, if an age"
1659,CANTO XI,Less bright succeed not! Cimabue thought
1660,CANTO XI,To lord it over painting’s field; and now
1661,CANTO XI,"The cry is Giotto’s, and his name eclips’d."
1662,CANTO XI,Thus hath one Guido from the other snatch’d
1663,CANTO XI,"The letter’d prize: and he perhaps is born,"
1664,CANTO XI,Who shall drive either from their nest. The noise
1665,CANTO XI,"Of worldly fame is but a blast of wind,"
1666,CANTO XI,"That blows from divers points, and shifts its name"
1667,CANTO XI,Shifting the point it blows from. Shalt thou more
1668,CANTO XI,"Live in the mouths of mankind, if thy flesh"
1669,CANTO XI,"Part shrivel’d from thee, than if thou hadst died,"
1670,CANTO XI,"Before the coral and the pap were left,"
1671,CANTO XI,Or ere some thousand years have passed? and that
1672,CANTO XI,"Is, to eternity compar’d, a space,"
1673,CANTO XI,Briefer than is the twinkling of an eye
1674,CANTO XI,To the heaven’s slowest orb. He there who treads
1675,CANTO XI,"So leisurely before me, far and wide"
1676,CANTO XI,Through Tuscany resounded once; and now
1677,CANTO XI,Is in Sienna scarce with whispers nam’d:
1678,CANTO XI,"There was he sov’reign, when destruction caught"
1679,CANTO XI,"The madd’ning rage of Florence, in that day"
1680,CANTO XI,Proud as she now is loathsome. Your renown
1681,CANTO XI,"Is as the herb, whose hue doth come and go,"
1682,CANTO XI,"And his might withers it, by whom it sprang"
1683,CANTO XI,Crude from the lap of earth.” I thus to him:
1684,CANTO XI,“True are thy sayings: to my heart they breathe
1685,CANTO XI,"The kindly spirit of meekness, and allay"
1686,CANTO XI,What tumours rankle there. But who is he
1687,CANTO XI,"Of whom thou spak’st but now?”—“This,” he replied,"
1688,CANTO XI,"“Is Provenzano. He is here, because"
1689,CANTO XI,"He reach’d, with grasp presumptuous, at the sway"
1690,CANTO XI,"Of all Sienna. Thus he still hath gone,"
1691,CANTO XI,"Thus goeth never-resting, since he died."
1692,CANTO XI,"Such is th’ acquittance render’d back of him,"
1693,CANTO XI,"Who, beyond measure, dar’d on earth.” I then:"
1694,CANTO XI,“If soul that to the verge of life delays
1695,CANTO XI,"Repentance, linger in that lower space,"
1696,CANTO XI,"Nor hither mount, unless good prayers befriend,"
1697,CANTO XI,How chanc’d admittance was vouchsaf’d to him?”
1698,CANTO XI,
1699,CANTO XI,"“When at his glory’s topmost height,” said he,"
1700,CANTO XI,"“Respect of dignity all cast aside,"
1701,CANTO XI,"Freely He fix’d him on Sienna’s plain,"
1702,CANTO XI,"A suitor to redeem his suff’ring friend,"
1703,CANTO XI,"Who languish’d in the prison-house of Charles,"
1704,CANTO XI,Nor for his sake refus’d through every vein
1705,CANTO XI,"To tremble. More I will not say; and dark,"
1706,CANTO XI,"I know, my words are, but thy neighbours soon"
1707,CANTO XI,Shall help thee to a comment on the text.
1708,CANTO XI,"This is the work, that from these limits freed him.”"

1714,CANTO XII,
1715,CANTO XII,
1716,CANTO XII,"With equal pace as oxen in the yoke,"
1717,CANTO XII,I with that laden spirit journey’d on
1718,CANTO XII,Long as the mild instructor suffer’d me;
1719,CANTO XII,"But when he bade me quit him, and proceed"
1720,CANTO XII,"(For “here,” said he, “behooves with sail and oars"
1721,CANTO XII,"Each man, as best he may, push on his bark”),"
1722,CANTO XII,"Upright, as one dispos’d for speed, I rais’d"
1723,CANTO XII,"My body, still in thought submissive bow’d."
1724,CANTO XII,
1725,CANTO XII,I now my leader’s track not loth pursued;
1726,CANTO XII,And each had shown how light we far’d along
1727,CANTO XII,When thus he warn’d me: “Bend thine eyesight down:
1728,CANTO XII,For thou to ease the way shall find it good
1729,CANTO XII,To ruminate the bed beneath thy feet.”
1730,CANTO XII,
1731,CANTO XII,"As in memorial of the buried, drawn"
1732,CANTO XII,"Upon earth-level tombs, the sculptur’d form"
1733,CANTO XII,"Of what was once, appears (at sight whereof"
1734,CANTO XII,"Tears often stream forth by remembrance wak’d,"
1735,CANTO XII,"Whose sacred stings the piteous only feel),"
1736,CANTO XII,"So saw I there, but with more curious skill"
1737,CANTO XII,"Of portraiture o’erwrought, whate’er of space"
1738,CANTO XII,From forth the mountain stretches. On one part
1739,CANTO XII,"Him I beheld, above all creatures erst"
1740,CANTO XII,"Created noblest, light’ning fall from heaven:"
1741,CANTO XII,On th’ other side with bolt celestial pierc’d
1742,CANTO XII,Briareus: cumb’ring earth he lay through dint
1743,CANTO XII,Of mortal ice-stroke. The Thymbraean god
1744,CANTO XII,"With Mars, I saw, and Pallas, round their sire,"
1745,CANTO XII,"Arm’d still, and gazing on the giant’s limbs"
1746,CANTO XII,Strewn o’er th’ ethereal field. Nimrod I saw:
1747,CANTO XII,"At foot of the stupendous work he stood,"
1748,CANTO XII,"As if bewilder’d, looking on the crowd"
1749,CANTO XII,Leagued in his proud attempt on Sennaar’s plain.
1750,CANTO XII,
1751,CANTO XII,O Niobe! in what a trance of woe
1752,CANTO XII,"Thee I beheld, upon that highway drawn,"
1753,CANTO XII,Sev’n sons on either side thee slain! O Saul!
1754,CANTO XII,How ghastly didst thou look! on thine own sword
1755,CANTO XII,"Expiring in Gilboa, from that hour"
1756,CANTO XII,Ne’er visited with rain from heav’n or dew!
1757,CANTO XII,
1758,CANTO XII,
1759,CANTO XII,O fond Arachne! thee I also saw
1760,CANTO XII,Half spider now in anguish crawling up
1761,CANTO XII,Th’ unfinish’d web thou weaved’st to thy bane!
1762,CANTO XII,
1763,CANTO XII,O Rehoboam! here thy shape doth seem
1764,CANTO XII,Louring no more defiance! but fear-smote
1765,CANTO XII,With none to chase him in his chariot whirl’d.
1766,CANTO XII,
1767,CANTO XII,Was shown beside upon the solid floor
1768,CANTO XII,How dear Alcmaeon forc’d his mother rate
1769,CANTO XII,That ornament in evil hour receiv’d:
1770,CANTO XII,How in the temple on Sennacherib fell
1771,CANTO XII,"His sons, and how a corpse they left him there."
1772,CANTO XII,Was shown the scath and cruel mangling made
1773,CANTO XII,"By Tomyris on Cyrus, when she cried:"
1774,CANTO XII,"“Blood thou didst thirst for, take thy fill of blood!”"
1775,CANTO XII,Was shown how routed in the battle fled
1776,CANTO XII,"Th’ Assyrians, Holofernes slain, and e’en"
1777,CANTO XII,The relics of the carnage. Troy I mark’d
1778,CANTO XII,"In ashes and in caverns. Oh! how fall’n,"
1779,CANTO XII,"How abject, Ilion, was thy semblance there!"
1780,CANTO XII,
1781,CANTO XII,What master of the pencil or the style
1782,CANTO XII,"Had trac’d the shades and lines, that might have made"
1783,CANTO XII,"The subtlest workman wonder? Dead the dead,"
1784,CANTO XII,The living seem’d alive; with clearer view
1785,CANTO XII,"His eye beheld not who beheld the truth,"
1786,CANTO XII,"Than mine what I did tread on, while I went"
1787,CANTO XII,Low bending. Now swell out; and with stiff necks
1788,CANTO XII,"Pass on, ye sons of Eve! veil not your looks,"
1789,CANTO XII,Lest they descry the evil of your path!
1790,CANTO XII,
1791,CANTO XII,I noted not (so busied was my thought)
1792,CANTO XII,"How much we now had circled of the mount,"
1793,CANTO XII,"And of his course yet more the sun had spent,"
1794,CANTO XII,"When he, who with still wakeful caution went,"
1795,CANTO XII,Admonish’d: “Raise thou up thy head: for know
1796,CANTO XII,Time is not now for slow suspense. Behold
1797,CANTO XII,That way an angel hasting towards us! Lo
1798,CANTO XII,Where duly the sixth handmaid doth return
1799,CANTO XII,From service on the day. Wear thou in look
1800,CANTO XII,"And gesture seemly grace of reverent awe,"
1801,CANTO XII,That gladly he may forward us aloft.
1802,CANTO XII,Consider that this day ne’er dawns again.”
1803,CANTO XII,
1804,CANTO XII,"Time’s loss he had so often warn’d me ’gainst,"
1805,CANTO XII,I could not miss the scope at which he aim’d.
1806,CANTO XII,
1807,CANTO XII,"The goodly shape approach’d us, snowy white"
1808,CANTO XII,"In vesture, and with visage casting streams"
1809,CANTO XII,Of tremulous lustre like the matin star.
1810,CANTO XII,"His arms he open’d, then his wings; and spake:"
1811,CANTO XII,"“Onward: the steps, behold! are near; and now"
1812,CANTO XII,Th’ ascent is without difficulty gain’d.”
1813,CANTO XII,
1814,CANTO XII,"A scanty few are they, who when they hear"
1815,CANTO XII,"Such tidings, hasten. O ye race of men"
1816,CANTO XII,"Though born to soar, why suffer ye a wind"
1817,CANTO XII,So slight to baffle ye? He led us on
1818,CANTO XII,Where the rock parted; here against my front
1819,CANTO XII,"Did beat his wings, then promis’d I should fare"
1820,CANTO XII,In safety on my way. As to ascend
1821,CANTO XII,"That steep, upon whose brow the chapel stands"
1822,CANTO XII,"(O’er Rubaconte, looking lordly down"
1823,CANTO XII,"On the well-guided city,) up the right"
1824,CANTO XII,Th’ impetuous rise is broken by the steps
1825,CANTO XII,"Carv’d in that old and simple age, when still"
1826,CANTO XII,The registry and label rested safe;
1827,CANTO XII,"Thus is th’ acclivity reliev’d, which here"
1828,CANTO XII,Precipitous from the other circuit falls:
1829,CANTO XII,But on each hand the tall cliff presses close.
1830,CANTO XII,
1831,CANTO XII,"As ent’ring there we turn’d, voices, in strain"
1832,CANTO XII,"Ineffable, sang: “Blessed are the poor"
1833,CANTO XII,In spirit.” Ah how far unlike to these
1834,CANTO XII,"The straits of hell; here songs to usher us,"
1835,CANTO XII,There shrieks of woe! We climb the holy stairs:
1836,CANTO XII,And lighter to myself by far I seem’d
1837,CANTO XII,"Than on the plain before, whence thus I spake:"
1838,CANTO XII,"“Say, master, of what heavy thing have I"
1839,CANTO XII,"Been lighten’d, that scarce aught the sense of toil"
1840,CANTO XII,Affects me journeying?” He in few replied:
1841,CANTO XII,"“When sin’s broad characters, that yet remain"
1842,CANTO XII,"Upon thy temples, though well nigh effac’d,"
1843,CANTO XII,"Shall be, as one is, all clean razed out,"
1844,CANTO XII,Then shall thy feet by heartiness of will
1845,CANTO XII,"Be so o’ercome, they not alone shall feel"
1846,CANTO XII,"No sense of labour, but delight much more"
1847,CANTO XII,Shall wait them urg’d along their upward way.”
1848,CANTO XII,
1849,CANTO XII,"Then like to one, upon whose head is plac’d"
1850,CANTO XII,Somewhat he deems not of but from the becks
1851,CANTO XII,Of others as they pass him by; his hand
1852,CANTO XII,"Lends therefore help to’ assure him, searches, finds,"
1853,CANTO XII,And well performs such office as the eye
1854,CANTO XII,Wants power to execute: so stretching forth
1855,CANTO XII,"The fingers of my right hand, did I find"
1856,CANTO XII,"Six only of the letters, which his sword"
1857,CANTO XII,Who bare the keys had trac’d upon my brow.
1858,CANTO XII,"The leader, as he mark’d mine action, smil’d."
1859,CANTO XII,
1860,CANTO XII,
1861,CANTO XII,
1862,CANTO XII,
1863,CANTO XIII,CANTO XIII
1864,CANTO XIII,
1865,CANTO XIII,
1866,CANTO XIII,"We reach’d the summit of the scale, and stood"
1867,CANTO XIII,Upon the second buttress of that mount
1868,CANTO XIII,"Which healeth him who climbs. A cornice there,"
1869,CANTO XIII,"Like to the former, girdles round the hill;"
1870,CANTO XIII,Save that its arch with sweep less ample bends.
1871,CANTO XIII,
1872,CANTO XIII,Shadow nor image there is seen; all smooth
1873,CANTO XIII,"The rampart and the path, reflecting nought"
1874,CANTO XIII,But the rock’s sullen hue. “If here we wait
1875,CANTO XIII,"For some to question,” said the bard, “I fear"
1876,CANTO XIII,Our choice may haply meet too long delay.”
1877,CANTO XIII,
1878,CANTO XIII,Then fixedly upon the sun his eyes
1879,CANTO XIII,"He fastn’d, made his right the central point"
1880,CANTO XIII,"From whence to move, and turn’d the left aside."
1881,CANTO XIII,"“O pleasant light, my confidence and hope,"
1882,CANTO XIII,"Conduct us thou,” he cried, “on this new way,"
1883,CANTO XIII,"Where now I venture, leading to the bourn"
1884,CANTO XIII,We seek. The universal world to thee
1885,CANTO XIII,Owes warmth and lustre. If no other cause
1886,CANTO XIII,"Forbid, thy beams should ever be our guide.”"
1887,CANTO XIII,
1888,CANTO XIII,"Far, as is measur’d for a mile on earth,"
1889,CANTO XIII,In brief space had we journey’d; such prompt will
1890,CANTO XIII,"Impell’d; and towards us flying, now were heard"
1891,CANTO XIII,"Spirits invisible, who courteously"
1892,CANTO XIII,Unto love’s table bade the welcome guest.
1893,CANTO XIII,"The voice, that first? flew by, call’d forth aloud,"
1894,CANTO XIII,"“They have no wine;” so on behind us past,"
1895,CANTO XIII,"Those sounds reiterating, nor yet lost"
1896,CANTO XIII,"In the faint distance, when another came"
1897,CANTO XIII,"Crying, “I am Orestes,” and alike"
1898,CANTO XIII,"Wing’d its fleet way. “Oh father!” I exclaim’d,"
1899,CANTO XIII,"“What tongues are these?” and as I question’d, lo!"
1900,CANTO XIII,"A third exclaiming, “Love ye those have wrong’d you.”"
1901,CANTO XIII,
1902,CANTO XIII,"“This circuit,” said my teacher, “knots the scourge"
1903,CANTO XIII,"For envy, and the cords are therefore drawn"
1904,CANTO XIII,By charity’s correcting hand. The curb
1905,CANTO XIII,"Is of a harsher sound, as thou shalt hear"
1906,CANTO XIII,"(If I deem rightly), ere thou reach the pass,"
1907,CANTO XIII,Where pardon sets them free. But fix thine eyes
1908,CANTO XIII,"Intently through the air, and thou shalt see"
1909,CANTO XIII,"A multitude before thee seated, each"
1910,CANTO XIII,Along the shelving grot.” Then more than erst
1911,CANTO XIII,"I op’d my eyes, before me view’d, and saw"
1912,CANTO XIII,Shadows with garments dark as was the rock;
1913,CANTO XIII,"And when we pass’d a little forth, I heard"
1914,CANTO XIII,"A crying, “Blessed Mary! pray for us,"
1915,CANTO XIII,Michael and Peter! all ye saintly host!”
1916,CANTO XIII,
1917,CANTO XIII,I do not think there walks on earth this day
1918,CANTO XIII,"Man so remorseless, that he hath not yearn’d"
1919,CANTO XIII,With pity at the sight that next I saw.
1920,CANTO XIII,"Mine eyes a load of sorrow teemed, when now"
1921,CANTO XIII,"I stood so near them, that their semblances"
1922,CANTO XIII,Came clearly to my view. Of sackcloth vile
1923,CANTO XIII,Their cov’ring seem’d; and on his shoulder one
1924,CANTO XIII,"Did stay another, leaning, and all lean’d"
1925,CANTO XIII,"Against the cliff. E’en thus the blind and poor,"
1926,CANTO XIII,"Near the confessionals, to crave an alms,"
1927,CANTO XIII,"Stand, each his head upon his fellow’s sunk,"
1928,CANTO XIII,
1929,CANTO XIII,
1930,CANTO XIII,"So most to stir compassion, not by sound"
1931,CANTO XIII,"Of words alone, but that, which moves not less,"
1932,CANTO XIII,The sight of mis’ry. And as never beam
1933,CANTO XIII,"Of noonday visiteth the eyeless man,"
1934,CANTO XIII,E’en so was heav’n a niggard unto these
1935,CANTO XIII,"Of his fair light; for, through the orbs of all,"
1936,CANTO XIII,"A thread of wire, impiercing, knits them up,"
1937,CANTO XIII,As for the taming of a haggard hawk.
1938,CANTO XIII,
1939,CANTO XIII,"It were a wrong, methought, to pass and look"
1940,CANTO XIII,"On others, yet myself the while unseen."
1941,CANTO XIII,To my sage counsel therefore did I turn.
1942,CANTO XIII,"He knew the meaning of the mute appeal,"
1943,CANTO XIII,"Nor waited for my questioning, but said:"
1944,CANTO XIII,"“Speak; and be brief, be subtle in thy words.”"
1945,CANTO XIII,
1946,CANTO XIII,"On that part of the cornice, whence no rim"
1947,CANTO XIII,"Engarlands its steep fall, did Virgil come;"
1948,CANTO XIII,"On the’ other side me were the spirits, their cheeks"
1949,CANTO XIII,"Bathing devout with penitential tears,"
1950,CANTO XIII,That through the dread impalement forc’d a way.
1951,CANTO XIII,
1952,CANTO XIII,"I turn’d me to them, and “O shades!” said I,"
1953,CANTO XIII,
1954,CANTO XIII,“Assur’d that to your eyes unveil’d shall shine
1955,CANTO XIII,"The lofty light, sole object of your wish,"
1956,CANTO XIII,So may heaven’s grace clear whatsoe’er of foam
1957,CANTO XIII,"Floats turbid on the conscience, that thenceforth"
1958,CANTO XIII,"The stream of mind roll limpid from its source,"
1959,CANTO XIII,As ye declare (for so shall ye impart
1960,CANTO XIII,A boon I dearly prize) if any soul
1961,CANTO XIII,Of Latium dwell among ye; and perchance
1962,CANTO XIII,"That soul may profit, if I learn so much.”"
1963,CANTO XIII,
1964,CANTO XIII,"“My brother, we are each one citizens"
1965,CANTO XIII,"Of one true city. Any thou wouldst say,"
1966,CANTO XIII,Who lived a stranger in Italia’s land.”
1967,CANTO XIII,
1968,CANTO XIII,"So heard I answering, as appeal’d, a voice"
1969,CANTO XIII,That onward came some space from whence I stood.
1970,CANTO XIII,
1971,CANTO XIII,"A spirit I noted, in whose look was mark’d"
1972,CANTO XIII,Expectance. Ask ye how? The chin was rais’d
1973,CANTO XIII,"As in one reft of sight. “Spirit,” said I,"
1974,CANTO XIII,“Who for thy rise are tutoring (if thou be
1975,CANTO XIII,"That which didst answer to me,) or by place"
1976,CANTO XIII,"Or name, disclose thyself, that I may know thee.”"
1977,CANTO XIII,
1978,CANTO XIII,"“I was,” it answer’d, “of Sienna: here"
1979,CANTO XIII,"I cleanse away with these the evil life,"
1980,CANTO XIII,"Soliciting with tears that He, who is,"
1981,CANTO XIII,Vouchsafe him to us. Though Sapia nam’d
1982,CANTO XIII,"In sapience I excell’d not, gladder far"
1983,CANTO XIII,"Of others’ hurt, than of the good befell me."
1984,CANTO XIII,"That thou mayst own I now deceive thee not,"
1985,CANTO XIII,"Hear, if my folly were not as I speak it."
1986,CANTO XIII,"When now my years slop’d waning down the arch,"
1987,CANTO XIII,"It so bechanc’d, my fellow citizens"
1988,CANTO XIII,"Near Colle met their enemies in the field,"
1989,CANTO XIII,And I pray’d God to grant what He had will’d.
1990,CANTO XIII,"There were they vanquish’d, and betook themselves"
1991,CANTO XIII,Unto the bitter passages of flight.
1992,CANTO XIII,"I mark’d the hunt, and waxing out of bounds"
1993,CANTO XIII,"In gladness, lifted up my shameless brow,"
1994,CANTO XIII,"And like the merlin cheated by a gleam,"
1995,CANTO XIII,"Cried, “It is over. Heav’n! I fear thee not.”"
1996,CANTO XIII,Upon my verge of life I wish’d for peace
1997,CANTO XIII,With God; nor repentance had supplied
1998,CANTO XIII,"What I did lack of duty, were it not"
1999,CANTO XIII,"The hermit Piero, touch’d with charity,"
2000,CANTO XIII,In his devout orisons thought on me.
2001,CANTO XIII,"“But who art thou that question’st of our state,"
2002,CANTO XIII,"Who go’st to my belief, with lids unclos’d,"
2003,CANTO XIII,"And breathest in thy talk?”—“Mine eyes,” said I,"
2004,CANTO XIII,“May yet be here ta’en from me; but not long;
2005,CANTO XIII,For they have not offended grievously
2006,CANTO XIII,With envious glances. But the woe beneath
2007,CANTO XIII,Urges my soul with more exceeding dread.
2008,CANTO XIII,That nether load already weighs me down.”
2009,CANTO XIII,
2010,CANTO XIII,She thus: “Who then amongst us here aloft
2011,CANTO XIII,"Hath brought thee, if thou weenest to return?"
2012,CANTO XIII,
2013,CANTO XIII,
2014,CANTO XIII,"“He,” answer’d I, “who standeth mute beside me."
2015,CANTO XIII,"I live: of me ask therefore, chosen spirit,"
2016,CANTO XIII,If thou desire I yonder yet should move
2017,CANTO XIII,"For thee my mortal feet.”—“Oh!” she replied,"
2018,CANTO XIII,"“This is so strange a thing, it is great sign"
2019,CANTO XIII,That God doth love thee. Therefore with thy prayer
2020,CANTO XIII,"Sometime assist me: and by that I crave,"
2021,CANTO XIII,"Which most thou covetest, that if thy feet"
2022,CANTO XIII,"E’er tread on Tuscan soil, thou save my fame"
2023,CANTO XIII,Amongst my kindred. Them shalt thou behold
2024,CANTO XIII,"With that vain multitude, who set their hope"
2025,CANTO XIII,"On Telamone’s haven, there to fail"
2026,CANTO XIII,"Confounded, more shall when the fancied stream"
2027,CANTO XIII,They sought of Dian call’d: but they who lead
2028,CANTO XIII,"Their navies, more than ruin’d hopes shall mourn.”"
2029,CANTO XIII,
2030,CANTO XIII,
2031,CANTO XIII,
2032,CANTO XIII,
2033,CANTO XIV,CANTO XIV
2034,CANTO XIV,
2035,CANTO XIV,
2036,CANTO XIV,"“Say who is he around our mountain winds,"
2037,CANTO XIV,"Or ever death has prun’d his wing for flight,"
2038,CANTO XIV,That opes his eyes and covers them at will?”
2039,CANTO XIV,
2040,CANTO XIV,"“I know not who he is, but know thus much"
2041,CANTO XIV,"He comes not singly. Do thou ask of him,"
2042,CANTO XIV,"For thou art nearer to him, and take heed"
2043,CANTO XIV,"Accost him gently, so that he may speak.”"
2044,CANTO XIV,
2045,CANTO XIV,Thus on the right two Spirits bending each
2046,CANTO XIV,"Toward the other, talk’d of me, then both"
2047,CANTO XIV,"Addressing me, their faces backward lean’d,"
2048,CANTO XIV,"And thus the one began: “O soul, who yet"
2049,CANTO XIV,"Pent in the body, tendest towards the sky!"
2050,CANTO XIV,"For charity, we pray thee’ comfort us,"
2051,CANTO XIV,"Recounting whence thou com’st, and who thou art:"
2052,CANTO XIV,For thou dost make us at the favour shown thee
2053,CANTO XIV,"Marvel, as at a thing that ne’er hath been.”"
2054,CANTO XIV,
2055,CANTO XIV,"“There stretches through the midst of Tuscany,”"
2056,CANTO XIV,"I straight began: “a brooklet, whose well-head"
2057,CANTO XIV,"Springs up in Falterona, with his race"
2058,CANTO XIV,"Not satisfied, when he some hundred miles"
2059,CANTO XIV,"Hath measur’d. From his banks bring, I this frame."
2060,CANTO XIV,To tell you who I am were words misspent:
2061,CANTO XIV,For yet my name scarce sounds on rumour’s lip.”
2062,CANTO XIV,
2063,CANTO XIV,“If well I do incorp’rate with my thought
2064,CANTO XIV,"The meaning of thy speech,” said he, who first"
2065,CANTO XIV,"Addrest me, “thou dost speak of Arno’s wave.”"
2066,CANTO XIV,
2067,CANTO XIV,To whom the other: “Why hath he conceal’d
2068,CANTO XIV,"The title of that river, as a man"
2069,CANTO XIV,"Doth of some horrible thing?” The spirit, who"
2070,CANTO XIV,"Thereof was question’d, did acquit him thus:"
2071,CANTO XIV,“I know not: but ’tis fitting well the name
2072,CANTO XIV,Should perish of that vale; for from the source
2073,CANTO XIV,Where teems so plenteously the Alpine steep
2074,CANTO XIV,"Maim’d of Pelorus, (that doth scarcely pass"
2075,CANTO XIV,"Beyond that limit,) even to the point"
2076,CANTO XIV,"Whereunto ocean is restor’d, what heaven"
2077,CANTO XIV,"Drains from th’ exhaustless store for all earth’s streams,"
2078,CANTO XIV,"Throughout the space is virtue worried down,"
2079,CANTO XIV,"As ’twere a snake, by all, for mortal foe,"
2080,CANTO XIV,"Or through disastrous influence on the place,"
2081,CANTO XIV,"Or else distortion of misguided wills,"
2082,CANTO XIV,"That custom goads to evil: whence in those,"
2083,CANTO XIV,"The dwellers in that miserable vale,"
2084,CANTO XIV,"Nature is so transform’d, it seems as they"
2085,CANTO XIV,"Had shar’d of Circe’s feeding. ’Midst brute swine,"
2086,CANTO XIV,Worthier of acorns than of other food
2087,CANTO XIV,"Created for man’s use, he shapeth first"
2088,CANTO XIV,"His obscure way; then, sloping onward, finds"
2089,CANTO XIV,"Curs, snarlers more in spite than power, from whom"
2090,CANTO XIV,"He turns with scorn aside: still journeying down,"
2091,CANTO XIV,By how much more the curst and luckless foss
2092,CANTO XIV,"Swells out to largeness, e’en so much it finds"
2093,CANTO XIV,Dogs turning into wolves. Descending still
2094,CANTO XIV,"Through yet more hollow eddies, next he meets"
2095,CANTO XIV,"A race of foxes, so replete with craft,"
2096,CANTO XIV,They do not fear that skill can master it.
2097,CANTO XIV,Nor will I cease because my words are heard
2098,CANTO XIV,By other ears than thine. It shall be well
2099,CANTO XIV,"For this man, if he keep in memory"
2100,CANTO XIV,What from no erring Spirit I reveal.
2101,CANTO XIV,"Lo! I behold thy grandson, that becomes"
2102,CANTO XIV,"A hunter of those wolves, upon the shore"
2103,CANTO XIV,"Of the fierce stream, and cows them all with dread:"
2104,CANTO XIV,"Their flesh yet living sets he up to sale,"
2105,CANTO XIV,Then like an aged beast to slaughter dooms.
2106,CANTO XIV,"Many of life he reaves, himself of worth"
2107,CANTO XIV,And goodly estimation. Smear’d with gore
2108,CANTO XIV,"Mark how he issues from the rueful wood,"
2109,CANTO XIV,"Leaving such havoc, that in thousand years"
2110,CANTO XIV,It spreads not to prime lustihood again.”
2111,CANTO XIV,
2112,CANTO XIV,"As one, who tidings hears of woe to come,"
2113,CANTO XIV,"Changes his looks perturb’d, from whate’er part"
2114,CANTO XIV,"The peril grasp him, so beheld I change"
2115,CANTO XIV,"That spirit, who had turn’d to listen, struck"
2116,CANTO XIV,"With sadness, soon as he had caught the word."
2117,CANTO XIV,
2118,CANTO XIV,His visage and the other’s speech did raise
2119,CANTO XIV,"Desire in me to know the names of both,"
2120,CANTO XIV,whereof with meek entreaty I inquir’d.
2121,CANTO XIV,
2122,CANTO XIV,"The shade, who late addrest me, thus resum’d:"
2123,CANTO XIV,“Thy wish imports that I vouchsafe to do
2124,CANTO XIV,For thy sake what thou wilt not do for mine.
2125,CANTO XIV,But since God’s will is that so largely shine
2126,CANTO XIV,"His grace in thee, I will be liberal too."
2127,CANTO XIV,Guido of Duca know then that I am.
2128,CANTO XIV,"Envy so parch’d my blood, that had I seen"
2129,CANTO XIV,"A fellow man made joyous, thou hadst mark’d"
2130,CANTO XIV,A livid paleness overspread my cheek.
2131,CANTO XIV,Such harvest reap I of the seed I sow’d.
2132,CANTO XIV,"O man, why place thy heart where there doth need"
2133,CANTO XIV,Exclusion of participants in good?
2134,CANTO XIV,"This is Rinieri’s spirit, this the boast"
2135,CANTO XIV,"And honour of the house of Calboli,"
2136,CANTO XIV,Where of his worth no heritage remains.
2137,CANTO XIV,"Nor his the only blood, that hath been stript"
2138,CANTO XIV,"(’twixt Po, the mount, the Reno, and the shore,)"
2139,CANTO XIV,Of all that truth or fancy asks for bliss;
2140,CANTO XIV,But in those limits such a growth has sprung
2141,CANTO XIV,"Of rank and venom’d roots, as long would mock"
2142,CANTO XIV,Slow culture’s toil. Where is good Lizio? where
2143,CANTO XIV,"Manardi, Traversalo, and Carpigna?"
2144,CANTO XIV,O bastard slips of old Romagna’s line!
2145,CANTO XIV,"When in Bologna the low artisan,"
2146,CANTO XIV,"And in Faenza yon Bernardin sprouts,"
2147,CANTO XIV,A gentle cyon from ignoble stem.
2148,CANTO XIV,"Wonder not, Tuscan, if thou see me weep,"
2149,CANTO XIV,"When I recall to mind those once lov’d names,"
2150,CANTO XIV,"Guido of Prata, and of Azzo him"
2151,CANTO XIV,"That dwelt with you; Tignoso and his troop,"
2152,CANTO XIV,"With Traversaro’s house and Anastagio’s,"
2153,CANTO XIV,"(Each race disherited) and beside these,"
2154,CANTO XIV,"The ladies and the knights, the toils and ease,"
2155,CANTO XIV,That witch’d us into love and courtesy;
2156,CANTO XIV,Where now such malice reigns in recreant hearts.
2157,CANTO XIV,"O Brettinoro! wherefore tarriest still,"
2158,CANTO XIV,"Since forth of thee thy family hath gone,"
2159,CANTO XIV,"And many, hating evil, join’d their steps?"
2160,CANTO XIV,"Well doeth he, that bids his lineage cease,"
2161,CANTO XIV,"Bagnacavallo; Castracaro ill,"
2162,CANTO XIV,"And Conio worse, who care to propagate"
2163,CANTO XIV,A race of Counties from such blood as theirs.
2164,CANTO XIV,"Well shall ye also do, Pagani, then"
2165,CANTO XIV,When from amongst you tries your demon child.
2166,CANTO XIV,"Not so, howe’er, that henceforth there remain"
2167,CANTO XIV,True proof of what ye were. O Hugolin!
2168,CANTO XIV,Thou sprung of Fantolini’s line! thy name
2169,CANTO XIV,"Is safe, since none is look’d for after thee"
2170,CANTO XIV,"To cloud its lustre, warping from thy stock."
2171,CANTO XIV,"But, Tuscan, go thy ways; for now I take"
2172,CANTO XIV,Far more delight in weeping than in words.
2173,CANTO XIV,Such pity for your sakes hath wrung my heart.”
2174,CANTO XIV,
2175,CANTO XIV,We knew those gentle spirits at parting heard
2176,CANTO XIV,Our steps. Their silence therefore of our way
2177,CANTO XIV,"Assur’d us. Soon as we had quitted them,"
2178,CANTO XIV,"Advancing onward, lo! a voice that seem’d"
2179,CANTO XIV,"Like vollied light’ning, when it rives the air,"
2180,CANTO XIV,"Met us, and shouted, “Whosoever finds"
2181,CANTO XIV,"Will slay me,” then fled from us, as the bolt"
2182,CANTO XIV,Lanc’d sudden from a downward-rushing cloud.
2183,CANTO XIV,"When it had giv’n short truce unto our hearing,"
2184,CANTO XIV,Behold the other with a crash as loud
2185,CANTO XIV,As the quick-following thunder: “Mark in me
2186,CANTO XIV,Aglauros turn’d to rock.” I at the sound
2187,CANTO XIV,Retreating drew more closely to my guide.
2188,CANTO XIV,
2189,CANTO XIV,Now in mute stillness rested all the air:
2190,CANTO XIV,And thus he spake: “There was the galling bit.
2191,CANTO XIV,"But your old enemy so baits his hook,"
2192,CANTO XIV,He drags you eager to him. Hence nor curb
2193,CANTO XIV,"Avails you, nor reclaiming call. Heav’n calls"
2194,CANTO XIV,And round about you wheeling courts your gaze
2195,CANTO XIV,With everlasting beauties. Yet your eye
2196,CANTO XIV,Turns with fond doting still upon the earth.
2197,CANTO XIV,Therefore He smites you who discerneth all.”
2198,CANTO XIV,
2199,CANTO XIV,
2200,CANTO XIV,
2201,CANTO XIV,
2202,CANTO XV,CANTO XV
2203,CANTO XV,
2204,CANTO XV,
2205,CANTO XV,"As much as ’twixt the third hour’s close and dawn,"
2206,CANTO XV,"Appeareth of heav’n’s sphere, that ever whirls"
2207,CANTO XV,"As restless as an infant in his play,"
2208,CANTO XV,So much appear’d remaining to the sun
2209,CANTO XV,Of his slope journey towards the western goal.
2210,CANTO XV,
2211,CANTO XV,"Evening was there, and here the noon of night;"
2212,CANTO XV,and full upon our forehead smote the beams.
2213,CANTO XV,"For round the mountain, circling, so our path"
2214,CANTO XV,"Had led us, that toward the sun-set now"
2215,CANTO XV,Direct we journey’d: when I felt a weight
2216,CANTO XV,"Of more exceeding splendour, than before,"
2217,CANTO XV,"Press on my front. The cause unknown, amaze"
2218,CANTO XV,"Possess’d me, and both hands against my brow"
2219,CANTO XV,"Lifting, I interpos’d them, as a screen,"
2220,CANTO XV,That of its gorgeous superflux of light
2221,CANTO XV,"Clipp’d the diminish’d orb. As when the ray,"
2222,CANTO XV,Striking On water or the surface clear
2223,CANTO XV,"Of mirror, leaps unto the opposite part,"
2224,CANTO XV,"Ascending at a glance, e’en as it fell,"
2225,CANTO XV,"(And so much differs from the stone, that falls)"
2226,CANTO XV,"Through equal space, as practice skill hath shown;"
2227,CANTO XV,Thus with refracted light before me seemed
2228,CANTO XV,The ground there smitten; whence in sudden haste
2229,CANTO XV,"My sight recoil’d. “What is this, sire belov’d!"
2230,CANTO XV,’Gainst which I strive to shield the sight in vain?”
2231,CANTO XV,"Cried I, “and which towards us moving seems?”"
2232,CANTO XV,
2233,CANTO XV,"“Marvel not, if the family of heav’n,”"
2234,CANTO XV,"He answer’d, “yet with dazzling radiance dim"
2235,CANTO XV,"Thy sense it is a messenger who comes,"
2236,CANTO XV,"Inviting man’s ascent. Such sights ere long,"
2237,CANTO XV,"Not grievous, shall impart to thee delight,"
2238,CANTO XV,As thy perception is by nature wrought
2239,CANTO XV,"Up to their pitch.” The blessed angel, soon"
2240,CANTO XV,"As we had reach’d him, hail’d us with glad voice:"
2241,CANTO XV,“Here enter on a ladder far less steep
2242,CANTO XV,Than ye have yet encounter’d.” We forthwith
2243,CANTO XV,"Ascending, heard behind us chanted sweet,"
2244,CANTO XV,"“Blessed the merciful,” and “happy thou!"
2245,CANTO XV,"That conquer’st.” Lonely each, my guide and I"
2246,CANTO XV,"Pursued our upward way; and as we went,"
2247,CANTO XV,"Some profit from his words I hop’d to win,"
2248,CANTO XV,"And thus of him inquiring, fram’d my speech:"
2249,CANTO XV,
2250,CANTO XV,"“What meant Romagna’s spirit, when he spake"
2251,CANTO XV,Of bliss exclusive with no partner shar’d?”
2252,CANTO XV,
2253,CANTO XV,"He straight replied: “No wonder, since he knows,"
2254,CANTO XV,"What sorrow waits on his own worst defect,"
2255,CANTO XV,"If he chide others, that they less may mourn."
2256,CANTO XV,"Because ye point your wishes at a mark,"
2257,CANTO XV,"Where, by communion of possessors, part"
2258,CANTO XV,"Is lessen’d, envy bloweth up the sighs of men."
2259,CANTO XV,"No fear of that might touch ye, if the love"
2260,CANTO XV,Of higher sphere exalted your desire.
2261,CANTO XV,"For there, by how much more they call it ours,"
2262,CANTO XV,So much propriety of each in good
2263,CANTO XV,"Increases more, and heighten’d charity"
2264,CANTO XV,Wraps that fair cloister in a brighter flame.”
2265,CANTO XV,
2266,CANTO XV,"“Now lack I satisfaction more,” said I,"
2267,CANTO XV,"“Than if thou hadst been silent at the first,"
2268,CANTO XV,And doubt more gathers on my lab’ring thought.
2269,CANTO XV,"How can it chance, that good distributed,"
2270,CANTO XV,"The many, that possess it, makes more rich,"
2271,CANTO XV,Than if ’t were shar’d by few?” He answering thus:
2272,CANTO XV,"“Thy mind, reverting still to things of earth,"
2273,CANTO XV,Strikes darkness from true light. The highest good
2274,CANTO XV,"Unlimited, ineffable, doth so speed"
2275,CANTO XV,"To love, as beam to lucid body darts,"
2276,CANTO XV,Giving as much of ardour as it finds.
2277,CANTO XV,The sempiternal effluence streams abroad
2278,CANTO XV,"Spreading, wherever charity extends."
2279,CANTO XV,So that the more aspirants to that bliss
2280,CANTO XV,"Are multiplied, more good is there to love,"
2281,CANTO XV,"And more is lov’d; as mirrors, that reflect,"
2282,CANTO XV,"Each unto other, propagated light."
2283,CANTO XV,If these my words avail not to allay
2284,CANTO XV,"Thy thirsting, Beatrice thou shalt see,"
2285,CANTO XV,"Who of this want, and of all else thou hast,"
2286,CANTO XV,Shall rid thee to the full. Provide but thou
2287,CANTO XV,"That from thy temples may be soon eras’d,"
2288,CANTO XV,"E’en as the two already, those five scars,"
2289,CANTO XV,"That when they pain thee worst, then kindliest heal,”"
2290,CANTO XV,
2291,CANTO XV,"“Thou,” I had said, “content’st me,” when I saw"
2292,CANTO XV,"The other round was gain’d, and wond’ring eyes"
2293,CANTO XV,Did keep me mute. There suddenly I seem’d
2294,CANTO XV,By an ecstatic vision wrapt away;
2295,CANTO XV,"And in a temple saw, methought, a crowd"
2296,CANTO XV,Of many persons; and at th’ entrance stood
2297,CANTO XV,"A dame, whose sweet demeanour did express"
2298,CANTO XV,"A mother’s love, who said, “Child! why hast thou"
2299,CANTO XV,Dealt with us thus? Behold thy sire and I
2300,CANTO XV,"Sorrowing have sought thee;” and so held her peace,"
2301,CANTO XV,And straight the vision fled. A female next
2302,CANTO XV,"Appear’d before me, down whose visage cours’d"
2303,CANTO XV,"Those waters, that grief forces out from one"
2304,CANTO XV,"By deep resentment stung, who seem’d to say:"
2305,CANTO XV,"“If thou, Pisistratus, be lord indeed"
2306,CANTO XV,"Over this city, nam’d with such debate"
2307,CANTO XV,"Of adverse gods, and whence each science sparkles,"
2308,CANTO XV,"Avenge thee of those arms, whose bold embrace"
2309,CANTO XV,"Hath clasp’d our daughter; “and to fuel, meseem’d,"
2310,CANTO XV,"Benign and meek, with visage undisturb’d,"
2311,CANTO XV,"Her sovran spake: “How shall we those requite,"
2312,CANTO XV,"Who wish us evil, if we thus condemn"
2313,CANTO XV,The man that loves us?” After that I saw
2314,CANTO XV,"A multitude, in fury burning, slay"
2315,CANTO XV,"With stones a stripling youth, and shout amain"
2316,CANTO XV,"“Destroy, destroy!” and him I saw, who bow’d"
2317,CANTO XV,"Heavy with death unto the ground, yet made"
2318,CANTO XV,"His eyes, unfolded upward, gates to heav’n,"
2319,CANTO XV,
2320,CANTO XV,
2321,CANTO XV,"Praying forgiveness of th’ Almighty Sire,"
2322,CANTO XV,"Amidst that cruel conflict, on his foes,"
2323,CANTO XV,"With looks, that With compassion to their aim."
2324,CANTO XV,
2325,CANTO XV,"Soon as my spirit, from her airy flight"
2326,CANTO XV,"Returning, sought again the things, whose truth"
2327,CANTO XV,"Depends not on her shaping, I observ’d"
2328,CANTO XV,How she had rov’d to no unreal scenes
2329,CANTO XV,
2330,CANTO XV,"Meanwhile the leader, who might see I mov’d,"
2331,CANTO XV,"As one, who struggles to shake off his sleep,"
2332,CANTO XV,"Exclaim’d: “What ails thee, that thou canst not hold"
2333,CANTO XV,"Thy footing firm, but more than half a league"
2334,CANTO XV,"Hast travel’d with clos’d eyes and tott’ring gait,"
2335,CANTO XV,Like to a man by wine or sleep o’ercharg’d?”
2336,CANTO XV,
2337,CANTO XV,"“Beloved father! so thou deign,” said I,"
2338,CANTO XV,"“To listen, I will tell thee what appear’d"
2339,CANTO XV,"Before me, when so fail’d my sinking steps.”"
2340,CANTO XV,
2341,CANTO XV,He thus: “Not if thy Countenance were mask’d
2342,CANTO XV,"With hundred vizards, could a thought of thine"
2343,CANTO XV,"How small soe’er, elude me. What thou saw’st"
2344,CANTO XV,"Was shown, that freely thou mightst ope thy heart"
2345,CANTO XV,"To the waters of peace, that flow diffus’d"
2346,CANTO XV,"From their eternal fountain. I not ask’d,"
2347,CANTO XV,"What ails thee? for such cause as he doth, who"
2348,CANTO XV,"Looks only with that eye which sees no more,"
2349,CANTO XV,"When spiritless the body lies; but ask’d,"
2350,CANTO XV,To give fresh vigour to thy foot. Such goads
2351,CANTO XV,The slow and loit’ring need; that they be found
2352,CANTO XV,"Not wanting, when their hour of watch returns.”"
2353,CANTO XV,
2354,CANTO XV,So on we journey’d through the evening sky
2355,CANTO XV,"Gazing intent, far onward, as our eyes"
2356,CANTO XV,With level view could stretch against the bright
2357,CANTO XV,Vespertine ray: and lo! by slow degrees
2358,CANTO XV,"Gath’ring, a fog made tow’rds us, dark as night."
2359,CANTO XV,There was no room for ’scaping; and that mist
2360,CANTO XV,"Bereft us, both of sight and the pure air."
2361,CANTO XV,
2362,CANTO XV,
2363,CANTO XV,
2364,CANTO XV,
2365,CANTO XVI,CANTO XVI
2366,CANTO XVI,
2367,CANTO XVI,
2368,CANTO XVI,"Hell’s dunnest gloom, or night unlustrous, dark,"
2369,CANTO XVI,"Of every planes ’reft, and pall’d in clouds,"
2370,CANTO XVI,Did never spread before the sight a veil
2371,CANTO XVI,"In thickness like that fog, nor to the sense"
2372,CANTO XVI,"So palpable and gross. Ent’ring its shade,"
2373,CANTO XVI,Mine eye endured not with unclosed lids;
2374,CANTO XVI,"Which marking, near me drew the faithful guide,"
2375,CANTO XVI,Offering me his shoulder for a stay.
2376,CANTO XVI,
2377,CANTO XVI,"As the blind man behind his leader walks,"
2378,CANTO XVI,"Lest he should err, or stumble unawares"
2379,CANTO XVI,"On what might harm him, or perhaps destroy,"
2380,CANTO XVI,"I journey’d through that bitter air and foul,"
2381,CANTO XVI,"Still list’ning to my escort’s warning voice,"
2382,CANTO XVI,“Look that from me thou part not.” Straight I heard
2383,CANTO XVI,"Voices, and each one seem’d to pray for peace,"
2384,CANTO XVI,"And for compassion, to the Lamb of God"
2385,CANTO XVI,That taketh sins away. Their prelude still
2386,CANTO XVI,"Was “Agnus Dei,” and through all the choir,"
2387,CANTO XVI,"One voice, one measure ran, that perfect seem’d"
2388,CANTO XVI,The concord of their song. “Are these I hear
2389,CANTO XVI,"Spirits, O master?” I exclaim’d; and he:"
2390,CANTO XVI,“Thou aim’st aright: these loose the bonds of wrath.”
2391,CANTO XVI,
2392,CANTO XVI,
2393,CANTO XVI,"“Now who art thou, that through our smoke dost cleave?"
2394,CANTO XVI,"And speak’st of us, as thou thyself e’en yet"
2395,CANTO XVI,Dividest time by calends?” So one voice
2396,CANTO XVI,Bespake me; whence my master said: “Reply;
2397,CANTO XVI,"And ask, if upward hence the passage lead.”"
2398,CANTO XVI,
2399,CANTO XVI,"“O being! who dost make thee pure, to stand"
2400,CANTO XVI,Beautiful once more in thy Maker’s sight!
2401,CANTO XVI,Along with me: and thou shalt hear and wonder.”
2402,CANTO XVI,"Thus I, whereto the spirit answering spake:"
2403,CANTO XVI,
2404,CANTO XVI,
2405,CANTO XVI,"“Long as ’t is lawful for me, shall my steps"
2406,CANTO XVI,Follow on thine; and since the cloudy smoke
2407,CANTO XVI,"Forbids the seeing, hearing in its stead"
2408,CANTO XVI,Shall keep us join’d.” I then forthwith began
2409,CANTO XVI,"“Yet in my mortal swathing, I ascend"
2410,CANTO XVI,"To higher regions, and am hither come"
2411,CANTO XVI,Through the fearful agony of hell.
2412,CANTO XVI,"And, if so largely God hath doled his grace,"
2413,CANTO XVI,"That, clean beside all modern precedent,"
2414,CANTO XVI,"He wills me to behold his kingly state,"
2415,CANTO XVI,"From me conceal not who thou wast, ere death"
2416,CANTO XVI,Had loos’d thee; but instruct me: and instruct
2417,CANTO XVI,If rightly to the pass I tend; thy words
2418,CANTO XVI,The way directing as a safe escort.”
2419,CANTO XVI,
2420,CANTO XVI,"“I was of Lombardy, and Marco call’d:"
2421,CANTO XVI,"Not inexperienc’d of the world, that worth"
2422,CANTO XVI,"I still affected, from which all have turn’d"
2423,CANTO XVI,The nerveless bow aside. Thy course tends right
2424,CANTO XVI,"Unto the summit:” and, replying thus,"
2425,CANTO XVI,"He added, “I beseech thee pray for me,"
2426,CANTO XVI,When thou shalt come aloft.” And I to him:
2427,CANTO XVI,“Accept my faith for pledge I will perform
2428,CANTO XVI,"What thou requirest. Yet one doubt remains,"
2429,CANTO XVI,"That wrings me sorely, if I solve it not,"
2430,CANTO XVI,"Singly before it urg’d me, doubled now"
2431,CANTO XVI,"By thine opinion, when I couple that"
2432,CANTO XVI,"With one elsewhere declar’d, each strength’ning other."
2433,CANTO XVI,The world indeed is even so forlorn
2434,CANTO XVI,Of all good as thou speak’st it and so swarms
2435,CANTO XVI,"With every evil. Yet, beseech thee, point"
2436,CANTO XVI,"The cause out to me, that myself may see,"
2437,CANTO XVI,And unto others show it: for in heaven
2438,CANTO XVI,"One places it, and one on earth below.”"
2439,CANTO XVI,
2440,CANTO XVI,"Then heaving forth a deep and audible sigh,"
2441,CANTO XVI,"“Brother!” he thus began, “the world is blind;"
2442,CANTO XVI,"And thou in truth com’st from it. Ye, who live,"
2443,CANTO XVI,"Do so each cause refer to heav’n above,"
2444,CANTO XVI,E’en as its motion of necessity
2445,CANTO XVI,"Drew with it all that moves. If this were so,"
2446,CANTO XVI,Free choice in you were none; nor justice would
2447,CANTO XVI,"There should be joy for virtue, woe for ill."
2448,CANTO XVI,Your movements have their primal bent from heaven;
2449,CANTO XVI,Not all; yet said I all; what then ensues?
2450,CANTO XVI,"Light have ye still to follow evil or good,"
2451,CANTO XVI,"And of the will free power, which, if it stand"
2452,CANTO XVI,"Firm and unwearied in Heav’n’s first assay,"
2453,CANTO XVI,"Conquers at last, so it be cherish’d well,"
2454,CANTO XVI,"Triumphant over all. To mightier force,"
2455,CANTO XVI,"To better nature subject, ye abide"
2456,CANTO XVI,"Free, not constrain’d by that, which forms in you"
2457,CANTO XVI,The reasoning mind uninfluenc’d of the stars.
2458,CANTO XVI,"If then the present race of mankind err,"
2459,CANTO XVI,"Seek in yourselves the cause, and find it there."
2460,CANTO XVI,Herein thou shalt confess me no false spy.
2461,CANTO XVI,
2462,CANTO XVI,"“Forth from his plastic hand, who charm’d beholds"
2463,CANTO XVI,"Her image ere she yet exist, the soul"
2464,CANTO XVI,"Comes like a babe, that wantons sportively"
2465,CANTO XVI,"Weeping and laughing in its wayward moods,"
2466,CANTO XVI,"As artless and as ignorant of aught,"
2467,CANTO XVI,Save that her Maker being one who dwells
2468,CANTO XVI,"With gladness ever, willingly she turns"
2469,CANTO XVI,To whate’er yields her joy. Of some slight good
2470,CANTO XVI,"The flavour soon she tastes; and, snar’d by that,"
2471,CANTO XVI,"With fondness she pursues it, if no guide"
2472,CANTO XVI,"Recall, no rein direct her wand’ring course."
2473,CANTO XVI,"Hence it behov’d, the law should be a curb;"
2474,CANTO XVI,"A sovereign hence behov’d, whose piercing view"
2475,CANTO XVI,Might mark at least the fortress and main tower
2476,CANTO XVI,Of the true city. Laws indeed there are:
2477,CANTO XVI,"But who is he observes them? None; not he,"
2478,CANTO XVI,"Who goes before, the shepherd of the flock,"
2479,CANTO XVI,Who chews the cud but doth not cleave the hoof.
2480,CANTO XVI,"Therefore the multitude, who see their guide"
2481,CANTO XVI,"Strike at the very good they covet most,"
2482,CANTO XVI,Feed there and look no further. Thus the cause
2483,CANTO XVI,"Is not corrupted nature in yourselves,"
2484,CANTO XVI,"But ill-conducting, that hath turn’d the world"
2485,CANTO XVI,"To evil. Rome, that turn’d it unto good,"
2486,CANTO XVI,"Was wont to boast two suns, whose several beams"
2487,CANTO XVI,"Cast light on either way, the world’s and God’s."
2488,CANTO XVI,One since hath quench’d the other; and the sword
2489,CANTO XVI,Is grafted on the crook; and so conjoin’d
2490,CANTO XVI,"Each must perforce decline to worse, unaw’d"
2491,CANTO XVI,"By fear of other. If thou doubt me, mark"
2492,CANTO XVI,The blade: each herb is judg’d of by its seed.
2493,CANTO XVI,"That land, through which Adice and the Po"
2494,CANTO XVI,"Their waters roll, was once the residence"
2495,CANTO XVI,"Of courtesy and velour, ere the day,"
2496,CANTO XVI,That frown’d on Frederick; now secure may pass
2497,CANTO XVI,"Those limits, whosoe’er hath left, for shame,"
2498,CANTO XVI,"To talk with good men, or come near their haunts."
2499,CANTO XVI,"Three aged ones are still found there, in whom"
2500,CANTO XVI,The old time chides the new: these deem it long
2501,CANTO XVI,Ere God restore them to a better world:
2502,CANTO XVI,"The good Gherardo, of Palazzo he"
2503,CANTO XVI,"Conrad, and Guido of Castello, nam’d"
2504,CANTO XVI,In Gallic phrase more fitly the plain Lombard.
2505,CANTO XVI,"On this at last conclude. The church of Rome,"
2506,CANTO XVI,"Mixing two governments that ill assort,"
2507,CANTO XVI,"Hath miss’d her footing, fall’n into the mire,"
2508,CANTO XVI,And there herself and burden much defil’d.”
2509,CANTO XVI,
2510,CANTO XVI,"“O Marco!” I replied, shine arguments"
2511,CANTO XVI,Convince me: and the cause I now discern
2512,CANTO XVI,Why of the heritage no portion came
2513,CANTO XVI,To Levi’s offspring. But resolve me this
2514,CANTO XVI,"Who that Gherardo is, that as thou sayst"
2515,CANTO XVI,"Is left a sample of the perish’d race,"
2516,CANTO XVI,And for rebuke to this untoward age?”
2517,CANTO XVI,
2518,CANTO XVI,"“Either thy words,” said he, “deceive; or else"
2519,CANTO XVI,"Are meant to try me; that thou, speaking Tuscan,"
2520,CANTO XVI,Appear’st not to have heard of good Gherado;
2521,CANTO XVI,"The sole addition that, by which I know him;"
2522,CANTO XVI,Unless I borrow’d from his daughter Gaia
2523,CANTO XVI,Another name to grace him. God be with you.
2524,CANTO XVI,I bear you company no more. Behold
2525,CANTO XVI,The dawn with white ray glimm’ring through the mist.
2526,CANTO XVI,I must away—the angel comes—ere he
2527,CANTO XVI,"Appear.” He said, and would not hear me more."
2528,CANTO XVI,
2529,CANTO XVI,
2530,CANTO XVI,
2531,CANTO XVI,
2532,CANTO XVII,CANTO XVII
2533,CANTO XVII,
2534,CANTO XVII,
2535,CANTO XVII,"Call to remembrance, reader, if thou e’er"
2536,CANTO XVII,"Hast, on a mountain top, been ta’en by cloud,"
2537,CANTO XVII,"Through which thou saw’st no better, than the mole"
2538,CANTO XVII,"Doth through opacous membrane; then, whene’er"
2539,CANTO XVII,The wat’ry vapours dense began to melt
2540,CANTO XVII,"Into thin air, how faintly the sun’s sphere"
2541,CANTO XVII,Seem’d wading through them; so thy nimble thought
2542,CANTO XVII,"May image, how at first I re-beheld"
2543,CANTO XVII,"The sun, that bedward now his couch o’erhung."
2544,CANTO XVII,
2545,CANTO XVII,Thus with my leader’s feet still equaling pace
2546,CANTO XVII,"From forth that cloud I came, when now expir’d"
2547,CANTO XVII,The parting beams from off the nether shores.
2548,CANTO XVII,
2549,CANTO XVII,O quick and forgetive power! that sometimes dost
2550,CANTO XVII,"So rob us of ourselves, we take no mark"
2551,CANTO XVII,Though round about us thousand trumpets clang!
2552,CANTO XVII,"What moves thee, if the senses stir not? Light"
2553,CANTO XVII,"Kindled in heav’n, spontaneous, self-inform’d,"
2554,CANTO XVII,Or likelier gliding down with swift illapse
2555,CANTO XVII,By will divine. Portray’d before me came
2556,CANTO XVII,"The traces of her dire impiety,"
2557,CANTO XVII,"Whose form was chang’d into the bird, that most"
2558,CANTO XVII,Delights itself in song: and here my mind
2559,CANTO XVII,"Was inwardly so wrapt, it gave no place"
2560,CANTO XVII,To aught that ask’d admittance from without.
2561,CANTO XVII,
2562,CANTO XVII,Next shower’d into my fantasy a shape
2563,CANTO XVII,"As of one crucified, whose visage spake"
2564,CANTO XVII,"Fell rancour, malice deep, wherein he died;"
2565,CANTO XVII,"And round him Ahasuerus the great king,"
2566,CANTO XVII,"Esther his bride, and Mordecai the just,"
2567,CANTO XVII,Blameless in word and deed. As of itself
2568,CANTO XVII,That unsubstantial coinage of the brain
2569,CANTO XVII,"Burst, like a bubble, Which the water fails"
2570,CANTO XVII,That fed it; in my vision straight uprose
2571,CANTO XVII,"A damsel weeping loud, and cried, “O queen!"
2572,CANTO XVII,O mother! wherefore has intemperate ire
2573,CANTO XVII,Driv’n thee to loath thy being? Not to lose
2574,CANTO XVII,"Lavinia, desp’rate thou hast slain thyself."
2575,CANTO XVII,"Now hast thou lost me. I am she, whose tears"
2576,CANTO XVII,"Mourn, ere I fall, a mother’s timeless end.”"
2577,CANTO XVII,
2578,CANTO XVII,"E’en as a sleep breaks off, if suddenly"
2579,CANTO XVII,"New radiance strike upon the closed lids,"
2580,CANTO XVII,The broken slumber quivering ere it dies;
2581,CANTO XVII,Thus from before me sunk that imagery
2582,CANTO XVII,"Vanishing, soon as on my face there struck"
2583,CANTO XVII,"The light, outshining far our earthly beam."
2584,CANTO XVII,As round I turn’d me to survey what place
2585,CANTO XVII,"I had arriv’d at, “Here ye mount,” exclaim’d"
2586,CANTO XVII,"A voice, that other purpose left me none,"
2587,CANTO XVII,"Save will so eager to behold who spake,"
2588,CANTO XVII,"I could not choose but gaze. As ’fore the sun,"
2589,CANTO XVII,"That weighs our vision down, and veils his form"
2590,CANTO XVII,"In light transcendent, thus my virtue fail’d"
2591,CANTO XVII,"Unequal. “This is Spirit from above,"
2592,CANTO XVII,"Who marshals us our upward way, unsought;"
2593,CANTO XVII,And in his own light shrouds him. As a man
2594,CANTO XVII,"Doth for himself, so now is done for us."
2595,CANTO XVII,"For whoso waits imploring, yet sees need"
2596,CANTO XVII,"Of his prompt aidance, sets himself prepar’d"
2597,CANTO XVII,"For blunt denial, ere the suit be made."
2598,CANTO XVII,Refuse we not to lend a ready foot
2599,CANTO XVII,"At such inviting: haste we to ascend,"
2600,CANTO XVII,"Before it darken: for we may not then,"
2601,CANTO XVII,Till morn again return.” So spake my guide;
2602,CANTO XVII,And to one ladder both address’d our steps;
2603,CANTO XVII,"And the first stair approaching, I perceiv’d"
2604,CANTO XVII,"Near me as ’twere the waving of a wing,"
2605,CANTO XVII,That fann’d my face and whisper’d: “Blessed they
2606,CANTO XVII,The peacemakers: they know not evil wrath.”
2607,CANTO XVII,
2608,CANTO XVII,Now to such height above our heads were rais’d
2609,CANTO XVII,"The last beams, follow’d close by hooded night,"
2610,CANTO XVII,That many a star on all sides through the gloom
2611,CANTO XVII,"Shone out. “Why partest from me, O my strength?”"
2612,CANTO XVII,So with myself I commun’d; for I felt
2613,CANTO XVII,My o’ertoil’d sinews slacken. We had reach’d
2614,CANTO XVII,"The summit, and were fix’d like to a bark"
2615,CANTO XVII,"Arriv’d at land. And waiting a short space,"
2616,CANTO XVII,"If aught should meet mine ear in that new round,"
2617,CANTO XVII,"Then to my guide I turn’d, and said: “Lov’d sire!"
2618,CANTO XVII,Declare what guilt is on this circle purg’d.
2619,CANTO XVII,"If our feet rest, no need thy speech should pause.”"
2620,CANTO XVII,
2621,CANTO XVII,"He thus to me: “The love of good, whate’er"
2622,CANTO XVII,"Wanted of just proportion, here fulfils."
2623,CANTO XVII,"Here plies afresh the oar, that loiter’d ill."
2624,CANTO XVII,"But that thou mayst yet clearlier understand,"
2625,CANTO XVII,"Give ear unto my words, and thou shalt cull"
2626,CANTO XVII,"Some fruit may please thee well, from this delay."
2627,CANTO XVII,
2628,CANTO XVII,"“Creator, nor created being, ne’er,"
2629,CANTO XVII,"My son,” he thus began, “was without love,"
2630,CANTO XVII,"Or natural, or the free spirit’s growth."
2631,CANTO XVII,Thou hast not that to learn. The natural still
2632,CANTO XVII,"Is without error; but the other swerves,"
2633,CANTO XVII,"If on ill object bent, or through excess"
2634,CANTO XVII,"Of vigour, or defect. While e’er it seeks"
2635,CANTO XVII,"The primal blessings, or with measure due"
2636,CANTO XVII,"Th’ inferior, no delight, that flows from it,"
2637,CANTO XVII,"Partakes of ill. But let it warp to evil,"
2638,CANTO XVII,"Or with more ardour than behooves, or less."
2639,CANTO XVII,"Pursue the good, the thing created then"
2640,CANTO XVII,Works ’gainst its Maker. Hence thou must infer
2641,CANTO XVII,"That love is germin of each virtue in ye,"
2642,CANTO XVII,"And of each act no less, that merits pain."
2643,CANTO XVII,"Now since it may not be, but love intend"
2644,CANTO XVII,"The welfare mainly of the thing it loves,"
2645,CANTO XVII,All from self-hatred are secure; and since
2646,CANTO XVII,No being can be thought t’ exist apart
2647,CANTO XVII,"And independent of the first, a bar"
2648,CANTO XVII,Of equal force restrains from hating that.
2649,CANTO XVII,
2650,CANTO XVII,“Grant the distinction just; and it remains
2651,CANTO XVII,"The’ evil must be another’s, which is lov’d."
2652,CANTO XVII,Three ways such love is gender’d in your clay.
2653,CANTO XVII,"There is who hopes (his neighbour’s worth deprest,)"
2654,CANTO XVII,"Preeminence himself, and coverts hence"
2655,CANTO XVII,For his own greatness that another fall.
2656,CANTO XVII,"There is who so much fears the loss of power,"
2657,CANTO XVII,"Fame, favour, glory (should his fellow mount"
2658,CANTO XVII,"Above him), and so sickens at the thought,"
2659,CANTO XVII,"He loves their opposite: and there is he,"
2660,CANTO XVII,Whom wrong or insult seems to gall and shame
2661,CANTO XVII,"That he doth thirst for vengeance, and such needs"
2662,CANTO XVII,Must doat on other’s evil. Here beneath
2663,CANTO XVII,This threefold love is mourn’d. Of th’ other sort

2665,CANTO XVII,But with disorder’d and irregular course.
2666,CANTO XVII,
2667,CANTO XVII,“All indistinctly apprehend a bliss
2668,CANTO XVII,"On which the soul may rest, the hearts of all"
2669,CANTO XVII,"Yearn after it, and to that wished bourn"
2670,CANTO XVII,All therefore strive to tend. If ye behold
2671,CANTO XVII,"Or seek it with a love remiss and lax,"
2672,CANTO XVII,This cornice after just repenting lays
2673,CANTO XVII,Its penal torment on ye. Other good
2674,CANTO XVII,"There is, where man finds not his happiness:"
2675,CANTO XVII,"It is not true fruition, not that blest"
2676,CANTO XVII,"Essence, of every good the branch and root."
2677,CANTO XVII,"The love too lavishly bestow’d on this,"
2678,CANTO XVII,"Along three circles over us, is mourn’d."

2688,CANTO XVIII,"The teacher ended, and his high discourse"
2689,CANTO XVIII,"Concluding, earnest in my looks inquir’d"
2690,CANTO XVIII,"If I appear’d content; and I, whom still"
2691,CANTO XVIII,"Unsated thirst to hear him urg’d, was mute,"
2692,CANTO XVIII,"Mute outwardly, yet inwardly I said:"
2693,CANTO XVIII,“Perchance my too much questioning offends.”
2694,CANTO XVIII,"But he, true father, mark’d the secret wish"
2695,CANTO XVIII,"By diffidence restrain’d, and speaking, gave"
2696,CANTO XVIII,"Me boldness thus to speak: “Master, my Sight"
2697,CANTO XVIII,"Gathers so lively virtue from thy beams,"
2698,CANTO XVIII,"That all, thy words convey, distinct is seen."
2699,CANTO XVIII,"Wherefore I pray thee, father, whom this heart"
2700,CANTO XVIII,Holds dearest! thou wouldst deign by proof t’ unfold
2701,CANTO XVIII,"That love, from which as from their source thou bring’st"
2702,CANTO XVIII,All good deeds and their opposite.” He then:
2703,CANTO XVIII,“To what I now disclose be thy clear ken
2704,CANTO XVIII,"Directed, and thou plainly shalt behold"
2705,CANTO XVIII,"How much those blind have err’d, who make themselves"
2706,CANTO XVIII,"The guides of men. The soul, created apt"
2707,CANTO XVIII,"To love, moves versatile which way soe’er"
2708,CANTO XVIII,"Aught pleasing prompts her, soon as she is wak’d"
2709,CANTO XVIII,By pleasure into act. Of substance true
2710,CANTO XVIII,"Your apprehension forms its counterfeit,"
2711,CANTO XVIII,And in you the ideal shape presenting
2712,CANTO XVIII,"Attracts the soul’s regard. If she, thus drawn,"
2713,CANTO XVIII,"incline toward it, love is that inclining,"
2714,CANTO XVIII,And a new nature knit by pleasure in ye.
2715,CANTO XVIII,"Then as the fire points up, and mounting seeks"
2716,CANTO XVIII,"His birth-place and his lasting seat, e’en thus"
2717,CANTO XVIII,"Enters the captive soul into desire,"
2718,CANTO XVIII,"Which is a spiritual motion, that ne’er rests"
2719,CANTO XVIII,Before enjoyment of the thing it loves.
2720,CANTO XVIII,"Enough to show thee, how the truth from those"
2721,CANTO XVIII,"Is hidden, who aver all love a thing"
2722,CANTO XVIII,Praise-worthy in itself: although perhaps
2723,CANTO XVIII,Its substance seem still good. Yet if the wax
2724,CANTO XVIII,"Be good, it follows not th’ impression must.”"
2725,CANTO XVIII,"“What love is,” I return’d, “thy words, O guide!"
2726,CANTO XVIII,"And my own docile mind, reveal. Yet thence"
2727,CANTO XVIII,New doubts have sprung. For from without if love
2728,CANTO XVIII,"Be offer’d to us, and the spirit knows"
2729,CANTO XVIII,"No other footing, tend she right or wrong,"
2730,CANTO XVIII,Is no desert of hers.” He answering thus:
2731,CANTO XVIII,“What reason here discovers I have power
2732,CANTO XVIII,"To show thee: that which lies beyond, expect"
2733,CANTO XVIII,"From Beatrice, faith not reason’s task."
2734,CANTO XVIII,"Spirit, substantial form, with matter join’d"
2735,CANTO XVIII,"Not in confusion mix’d, hath in itself"
2736,CANTO XVIII,"Specific virtue of that union born,"
2737,CANTO XVIII,"Which is not felt except it work, nor prov’d"
2738,CANTO XVIII,"But through effect, as vegetable life"
2739,CANTO XVIII,By the green leaf. From whence his intellect
2740,CANTO XVIII,"Deduced its primal notices of things,"
2741,CANTO XVIII,"Man therefore knows not, or his appetites"
2742,CANTO XVIII,"Their first affections; such in you, as zeal"
2743,CANTO XVIII,"In bees to gather honey; at the first,"
2744,CANTO XVIII,"Volition, meriting nor blame nor praise."
2745,CANTO XVIII,"But o’er each lower faculty supreme,"
2746,CANTO XVIII,"That as she list are summon’d to her bar,"
2747,CANTO XVIII,"Ye have that virtue in you, whose just voice"
2748,CANTO XVIII,"Uttereth counsel, and whose word should keep"
2749,CANTO XVIII,"The threshold of assent. Here is the source,"
2750,CANTO XVIII,"Whence cause of merit in you is deriv’d,"
2751,CANTO XVIII,"E’en as the affections good or ill she takes,"
2752,CANTO XVIII,"Or severs, winnow’d as the chaff. Those men"
2753,CANTO XVIII,"Who reas’ning went to depth profoundest, mark’d"
2754,CANTO XVIII,"That innate freedom, and were thence induc’d"
2755,CANTO XVIII,To leave their moral teaching to the world.
2756,CANTO XVIII,"Grant then, that from necessity arise"
2757,CANTO XVIII,All love that glows within you; to dismiss
2758,CANTO XVIII,"Or harbour it, the pow’r is in yourselves."
2759,CANTO XVIII,"Remember, Beatrice, in her style,"
2760,CANTO XVIII,Denominates free choice by eminence
2761,CANTO XVIII,"The noble virtue, if in talk with thee"
2762,CANTO XVIII,"She touch upon that theme.” The moon, well nigh"
2763,CANTO XVIII,"To midnight hour belated, made the stars"
2764,CANTO XVIII,Appear to wink and fade; and her broad disk
2765,CANTO XVIII,"Seem’d like a crag on fire, as up the vault"
2766,CANTO XVIII,"That course she journey’d, which the sun then warms,"
2767,CANTO XVIII,When they of Rome behold him at his set.
2768,CANTO XVIII,Betwixt Sardinia and the Corsic isle.
2769,CANTO XVIII,"And now the weight, that hung upon my thought,"
2770,CANTO XVIII,"Was lighten’d by the aid of that clear spirit,"
2771,CANTO XVIII,Who raiseth Andes above Mantua’s name.
2772,CANTO XVIII,"I therefore, when my questions had obtain’d"
2773,CANTO XVIII,"Solution plain and ample, stood as one"
2774,CANTO XVIII,Musing in dreary slumber; but not long
2775,CANTO XVIII,"Slumber’d; for suddenly a multitude,"
2776,CANTO XVIII,
2777,CANTO XVIII,
2778,CANTO XVIII,"The steep already turning, from behind,"
2779,CANTO XVIII,"Rush’d on. With fury and like random rout,"
2780,CANTO XVIII,As echoing on their shores at midnight heard
2781,CANTO XVIII,"Ismenus and Asopus, for his Thebes"
2782,CANTO XVIII,If Bacchus’ help were needed; so came these
2783,CANTO XVIII,"Tumultuous, curving each his rapid step,"
2784,CANTO XVIII,By eagerness impell’d of holy love.
2785,CANTO XVIII,
2786,CANTO XVIII,Soon they o’ertook us; with such swiftness mov’d
2787,CANTO XVIII,The mighty crowd. Two spirits at their head
2788,CANTO XVIII,Cried weeping; “Blessed Mary sought with haste
2789,CANTO XVIII,The hilly region. Caesar to subdue
2790,CANTO XVIII,"Ilerda, darted in Marseilles his sting,"
2791,CANTO XVIII,And flew to Spain.”—“Oh tarry not: away;”
2792,CANTO XVIII,The others shouted; “let not time be lost
2793,CANTO XVIII,Through slackness of affection. Hearty zeal
2794,CANTO XVIII,To serve reanimates celestial grace.”
2795,CANTO XVIII,
2796,CANTO XVIII,"“O ye, in whom intenser fervency"
2797,CANTO XVIII,"Haply supplies, where lukewarm erst ye fail’d,"
2798,CANTO XVIII,"Slow or neglectful, to absolve your part"
2799,CANTO XVIII,"Of good and virtuous, this man, who yet lives,"
2800,CANTO XVIII,"(Credit my tale, though strange) desires t’ ascend,"
2801,CANTO XVIII,So morning rise to light us. Therefore say
2802,CANTO XVIII,Which hand leads nearest to the rifted rock?”
2803,CANTO XVIII,
2804,CANTO XVIII,"So spake my guide, to whom a shade return’d:"
2805,CANTO XVIII,"“Come after us, and thou shalt find the cleft."
2806,CANTO XVIII,We may not linger: such resistless will
2807,CANTO XVIII,Speeds our unwearied course. Vouchsafe us then
2808,CANTO XVIII,"Thy pardon, if our duty seem to thee"
2809,CANTO XVIII,Discourteous rudeness. In Verona I
2810,CANTO XVIII,"Was abbot of San Zeno, when the hand"
2811,CANTO XVIII,"Of Barbarossa grasp’d Imperial sway,"
2812,CANTO XVIII,"That name, ne’er utter’d without tears in Milan."
2813,CANTO XVIII,"And there is he, hath one foot in his grave,"
2814,CANTO XVIII,"Who for that monastery ere long shall weep,"
2815,CANTO XVIII,"Ruing his power misus’d: for that his son,"
2816,CANTO XVIII,"Of body ill compact, and worse in mind,"
2817,CANTO XVIII,"And born in evil, he hath set in place"
2818,CANTO XVIII,"Of its true pastor.” Whether more he spake,"
2819,CANTO XVIII,"Or here was mute, I know not: he had sped"
2820,CANTO XVIII,E’en now so far beyond us. Yet thus much
2821,CANTO XVIII,"I heard, and in rememb’rance treasur’d it."
2822,CANTO XVIII,
2823,CANTO XVIII,"He then, who never fail’d me at my need,"
2824,CANTO XVIII,"Cried, “Hither turn. Lo! two with sharp remorse"
2825,CANTO XVIII,Chiding their sin!” In rear of all the troop
2826,CANTO XVIII,"These shouted: “First they died, to whom the sea"
2827,CANTO XVIII,"Open’d, or ever Jordan saw his heirs:"
2828,CANTO XVIII,"And they, who with Aeneas to the end"
2829,CANTO XVIII,"Endur’d not suffering, for their portion chose"
2830,CANTO XVIII,Life without glory.” Soon as they had fled
2831,CANTO XVIII,"Past reach of sight, new thought within me rose"
2832,CANTO XVIII,"By others follow’d fast, and each unlike"
2833,CANTO XVIII,"Its fellow: till led on from thought to thought,"
2834,CANTO XVIII,"And pleasur’d with the fleeting train, mine eye"
2835,CANTO XVIII,"Was clos’d, and meditation chang’d to dream."
2836,CANTO XVIII,
2837,CANTO XVIII,
2838,CANTO XVIII,
2839,CANTO XVIII,
2840,CANTO XIX,CANTO XIX
2841,CANTO XIX,
2842,CANTO XIX,
2843,CANTO XIX,"It was the hour, when of diurnal heat"
2844,CANTO XIX,"No reliques chafe the cold beams of the moon,"
2845,CANTO XIX,"O’erpower’d by earth, or planetary sway"
2846,CANTO XIX,Of Saturn; and the geomancer sees
2847,CANTO XIX,"His Greater Fortune up the east ascend,"
2848,CANTO XIX,Where gray dawn checkers first the shadowy cone;
2849,CANTO XIX,When ’fore me in my dream a woman’s shape
2850,CANTO XIX,"There came, with lips that stammer’d, eyes aslant,"
2851,CANTO XIX,"Distorted feet, hands maim’d, and colour pale."
2852,CANTO XIX,
2853,CANTO XIX,I look’d upon her; and as sunshine cheers
2854,CANTO XIX,"Limbs numb’d by nightly cold, e’en thus my look"
2855,CANTO XIX,"Unloos’d her tongue, next in brief space her form"
2856,CANTO XIX,"Decrepit rais’d erect, and faded face"
2857,CANTO XIX,With love’s own hue illum’d. Recov’ring speech
2858,CANTO XIX,"She forthwith warbling such a strain began,"
2859,CANTO XIX,"That I, how loth soe’er, could scarce have held"
2860,CANTO XIX,"Attention from the song. “I,” thus she sang,"
2861,CANTO XIX,"“I am the Siren, she, whom mariners"
2862,CANTO XIX,On the wide sea are wilder’d when they hear:
2863,CANTO XIX,Such fulness of delight the list’ner feels.
2864,CANTO XIX,I from his course Ulysses by my lay
2865,CANTO XIX,Enchanted drew. Whoe’er frequents me once
2866,CANTO XIX,"Parts seldom; so I charm him, and his heart"
2867,CANTO XIX,Contented knows no void.” Or ere her mouth
2868,CANTO XIX,"Was clos’d, to shame her at her side appear’d"
2869,CANTO XIX,A dame of semblance holy. With stern voice
2870,CANTO XIX,"She utter’d; “Say, O Virgil, who is this?”"
2871,CANTO XIX,"Which hearing, he approach’d, with eyes still bent"
2872,CANTO XIX,"Toward that goodly presence: th’ other seiz’d her,"
2873,CANTO XIX,"And, her robes tearing, open’d her before,"
2874,CANTO XIX,"And show’d the belly to me, whence a smell,"
2875,CANTO XIX,"Exhaling loathsome, wak’d me. Round I turn’d"
2876,CANTO XIX,"Mine eyes, and thus the teacher: “At the least"
2877,CANTO XIX,"Three times my voice hath call’d thee. Rise, begone."
2878,CANTO XIX,Let us the opening find where thou mayst pass.”
2879,CANTO XIX,
2880,CANTO XIX,"I straightway rose. Now day, pour’d down from high,"
2881,CANTO XIX,Fill’d all the circuits of the sacred mount;
2882,CANTO XIX,"And, as we journey’d, on our shoulder smote"
2883,CANTO XIX,"The early ray. I follow’d, stooping low"
2884,CANTO XIX,"My forehead, as a man, o’ercharg’d with thought,"
2885,CANTO XIX,"Who bends him to the likeness of an arch,"
2886,CANTO XIX,"That midway spans the flood; when thus I heard,"
2887,CANTO XIX,"“Come, enter here,” in tone so soft and mild,"
2888,CANTO XIX,As never met the ear on mortal strand.
2889,CANTO XIX,
2890,CANTO XIX,"With swan-like wings dispread and pointing up,"
2891,CANTO XIX,"Who thus had spoken marshal’d us along,"
2892,CANTO XIX,Where each side of the solid masonry
2893,CANTO XIX,"The sloping, walls retir’d; then mov’d his plumes,"
2894,CANTO XIX,"And fanning us, affirm’d that those, who mourn,"
2895,CANTO XIX,"Are blessed, for that comfort shall be theirs."
2896,CANTO XIX,
2897,CANTO XIX,"“What aileth thee, that still thou look’st to earth?”"
2898,CANTO XIX,Began my leader; while th’ angelic shape
2899,CANTO XIX,A little over us his station took.
2900,CANTO XIX,
2901,CANTO XIX,
2902,CANTO XIX,"“New vision,” I replied, “hath rais’d in me"
2903,CANTO XIX,"Surmizings strange and anxious doubts, whereon"
2904,CANTO XIX,My soul intent allows no other thought
2905,CANTO XIX,"Or room or entrance.”—“Hast thou seen,” said he,"
2906,CANTO XIX,"“That old enchantress, her, whose wiles alone"
2907,CANTO XIX,The spirits o’er us weep for? Hast thou seen
2908,CANTO XIX,How man may free him of her bonds? Enough.
2909,CANTO XIX,"Let thy heels spurn the earth, and thy rais’d ken"
2910,CANTO XIX,"Fix on the lure, which heav’n’s eternal King"
2911,CANTO XIX,Whirls in the rolling spheres.” As on his feet
2912,CANTO XIX,"The falcon first looks down, then to the sky"
2913,CANTO XIX,"Turns, and forth stretches eager for the food,"
2914,CANTO XIX,"That woos him thither; so the call I heard,"
2915,CANTO XIX,"So onward, far as the dividing rock"
2916,CANTO XIX,"Gave way, I journey’d, till the plain was reach’d."
2917,CANTO XIX,
2918,CANTO XIX,"On the fifth circle when I stood at large,"
2919,CANTO XIX,"A race appear’d before me, on the ground"
2920,CANTO XIX,All downward lying prone and weeping sore.
2921,CANTO XIX,"“My soul hath cleaved to the dust,” I heard"
2922,CANTO XIX,"With sighs so deep, they well nigh choak’d the words."
2923,CANTO XIX,"“O ye elect of God, whose penal woes"
2924,CANTO XIX,"Both hope and justice mitigate, direct"
2925,CANTO XIX,Tow’rds the steep rising our uncertain way.”
2926,CANTO XIX,
2927,CANTO XIX,"“If ye approach secure from this our doom,"
2928,CANTO XIX,"Prostration—and would urge your course with speed,"
2929,CANTO XIX,See that ye still to rightward keep the brink.”
2930,CANTO XIX,
2931,CANTO XIX,"So them the bard besought; and such the words,"
2932,CANTO XIX,"Beyond us some short space, in answer came."
2933,CANTO XIX,
2934,CANTO XIX,I noted what remain’d yet hidden from them:
2935,CANTO XIX,"Thence to my liege’s eyes mine eyes I bent,"
2936,CANTO XIX,"And he, forthwith interpreting their suit,"
2937,CANTO XIX,"Beckon’d his glad assent. Free then to act,"
2938,CANTO XIX,"As pleas’d me, I drew near, and took my stand"
2939,CANTO XIX,"O`er that shade, whose words I late had mark’d."
2940,CANTO XIX,"And, “Spirit!” I said, “in whom repentant tears"
2941,CANTO XIX,"Mature that blessed hour, when thou with God"
2942,CANTO XIX,"Shalt find acceptance, for a while suspend"
2943,CANTO XIX,"For me that mightier care. Say who thou wast,"
2944,CANTO XIX,"Why thus ye grovel on your bellies prone,"
2945,CANTO XIX,"And if in aught ye wish my service there,"
2946,CANTO XIX,Whence living I am come.” He answering spake
2947,CANTO XIX,“The cause why Heav’n our back toward his cope
2948,CANTO XIX,"Reverses, shalt thou know: but me know first"
2949,CANTO XIX,"The successor of Peter, and the name"
2950,CANTO XIX,"And title of my lineage from that stream,"
2951,CANTO XIX,That’ twixt Chiaveri and Siestri draws
2952,CANTO XIX,His limpid waters through the lowly glen.
2953,CANTO XIX,"A month and little more by proof I learnt,"
2954,CANTO XIX,With what a weight that robe of sov’reignty
2955,CANTO XIX,"Upon his shoulder rests, who from the mire"
2956,CANTO XIX,Would guard it: that each other fardel seems
2957,CANTO XIX,"But feathers in the balance. Late, alas!"
2958,CANTO XIX,Was my conversion: but when I became
2959,CANTO XIX,"Rome’s pastor, I discern’d at once the dream"
2960,CANTO XIX,"And cozenage of life, saw that the heart"
2961,CANTO XIX,"Rested not there, and yet no prouder height"
2962,CANTO XIX,"Lur’d on the climber: wherefore, of that life"
2963,CANTO XIX,"No more enamour’d, in my bosom love"
2964,CANTO XIX,Of purer being kindled. For till then
2965,CANTO XIX,"I was a soul in misery, alienate"
2966,CANTO XIX,"From God, and covetous of all earthly things;"
2967,CANTO XIX,"Now, as thou seest, here punish’d for my doting."
2968,CANTO XIX,Such cleansing from the taint of avarice
2969,CANTO XIX,Do spirits converted need. This mount inflicts
2970,CANTO XIX,No direr penalty. E’en as our eyes
2971,CANTO XIX,"Fasten’d below, nor e’er to loftier clime"
2972,CANTO XIX,"Were lifted, thus hath justice level’d us"
2973,CANTO XIX,Here on the earth. As avarice quench’d our love
2974,CANTO XIX,"Of good, without which is no working, thus"
2975,CANTO XIX,"Here justice holds us prison’d, hand and foot"
2976,CANTO XIX,"Chain’d down and bound, while heaven’s just Lord shall please."
2977,CANTO XIX,So long to tarry motionless outstretch’d.”
2978,CANTO XIX,
2979,CANTO XIX,"My knees I stoop’d, and would have spoke; but he,"
2980,CANTO XIX,"Ere my beginning, by his ear perceiv’d"
2981,CANTO XIX,"I did him reverence; and “What cause,” said he,"
2982,CANTO XIX,"“Hath bow’d thee thus!”—“Compunction,” I rejoin’d."
2983,CANTO XIX,“And inward awe of your high dignity.”
2984,CANTO XIX,
2985,CANTO XIX,
2986,CANTO XIX,"“Up,” he exclaim’d, “brother! upon thy feet"
2987,CANTO XIX,"Arise: err not: thy fellow servant I,"
2988,CANTO XIX,(Thine and all others’) of one Sovran Power.
2989,CANTO XIX,If thou hast ever mark’d those holy sounds
2990,CANTO XIX,"Of gospel truth, ‘nor shall be given ill marriage,’"
2991,CANTO XIX,Thou mayst discern the reasons of my speech.
2992,CANTO XIX,Go thy ways now; and linger here no more.
2993,CANTO XIX,"Thy tarrying is a let unto the tears,"
2994,CANTO XIX,With which I hasten that whereof thou spak’st.
2995,CANTO XIX,I have on earth a kinswoman; her name
2996,CANTO XIX,"Alagia, worthy in herself, so ill"
2997,CANTO XIX,Example of our house corrupt her not:
2998,CANTO XIX,And she is all remaineth of me there.”

3009,CANTO XX,
3010,CANTO XX,"Onward I mov’d: he also onward mov’d,"
3011,CANTO XX,"Who led me, coasting still, wherever place"

3025,CANTO XX,Whom piteously I heard lament and wail;
3026,CANTO XX,
3027,CANTO XX,
3028,CANTO XX,"And, ’midst the wailing, one before us heard"
3029,CANTO XX,Cry out “O blessed Virgin!” as a dame

3034,CANTO XX,"With poverty, before great wealth with vice.”"
3035,CANTO XX,
3036,CANTO XX,"The words so pleas’d me, that desire to know"
3037,CANTO XX,"The spirit, from whose lip they seem’d to come,"
3038,CANTO XX,Did draw me onward. Yet it spake the gift
3039,CANTO XX,"Of Nicholas, which on the maidens he"
3040,CANTO XX,"Bounteous bestow’d, to save their youthful prime"
3041,CANTO XX,Unblemish’d. “Spirit! who dost speak of deeds
3042,CANTO XX,"So worthy, tell me who thou was,” I said,"
3043,CANTO XX,“And why thou dost with single voice renew
3044,CANTO XX,Memorial of such praise. That boon vouchsaf’d
3045,CANTO XX,Haply shall meet reward; if I return
3046,CANTO XX,"To finish the Short pilgrimage of life,"
3047,CANTO XX,Still speeding to its close on restless wing.”
3048,CANTO XX,
3049,CANTO XX,"“I,” answer’d he, “will tell thee, not for hell,"
3050,CANTO XX,Which thence I look for; but that in thyself
3051,CANTO XX,"Grace so exceeding shines, before thy time"
3052,CANTO XX,Of mortal dissolution. I was root
3053,CANTO XX,"Of that ill plant, whose shade such poison sheds"
3054,CANTO XX,"O’er all the Christian land, that seldom thence"
3055,CANTO XX,"Good fruit is gather’d. Vengeance soon should come,"
3056,CANTO XX,"Had Ghent and Douay, Lille and Bruges power;"
3057,CANTO XX,And vengeance I of heav’n’s great Judge implore.
3058,CANTO XX,Hugh Capet was I high: from me descend
3059,CANTO XX,"The Philips and the Louis, of whom France"
3060,CANTO XX,"Newly is govern’d; born of one, who ply’d"
3061,CANTO XX,The slaughterer’s trade at Paris. When the race
3062,CANTO XX,Of ancient kings had vanish’d (all save one
3063,CANTO XX,Wrapt up in sable weeds) within my gripe
3064,CANTO XX,"I found the reins of empire, and such powers"
3065,CANTO XX,"Of new acquirement, with full store of friends,"
3066,CANTO XX,That soon the widow’d circlet of the crown
3067,CANTO XX,"Was girt upon the temples of my son,"
3068,CANTO XX,"He, from whose bones th’ anointed race begins."
3069,CANTO XX,Till the great dower of Provence had remov’d
3070,CANTO XX,"The stains, that yet obscur’d our lowly blood,"
3071,CANTO XX,"Its sway indeed was narrow, but howe’er"
3072,CANTO XX,"It wrought no evil: there, with force and lies,"
3073,CANTO XX,"Began its rapine; after, for amends,"
3074,CANTO XX,"Poitou it seiz’d, Navarre and Gascony."
3075,CANTO XX,"To Italy came Charles, and for amends"
3076,CANTO XX,"Young Conradine an innocent victim slew,"
3077,CANTO XX,"And sent th’ angelic teacher back to heav’n,"
3078,CANTO XX,"Still for amends. I see the time at hand,"
3079,CANTO XX,That forth from France invites another Charles
3080,CANTO XX,To make himself and kindred better known.
3081,CANTO XX,"Unarm’d he issues, saving with that lance,"
3082,CANTO XX,Which the arch-traitor tilted with; and that
3083,CANTO XX,"He carries with so home a thrust, as rives"
3084,CANTO XX,The bowels of poor Florence. No increase
3085,CANTO XX,"Of territory hence, but sin and shame"
3086,CANTO XX,"Shall be his guerdon, and so much the more"
3087,CANTO XX,As he more lightly deems of such foul wrong.
3088,CANTO XX,"I see the other, who a prisoner late"
3089,CANTO XX,"Had steps on shore, exposing to the mart"
3090,CANTO XX,"His daughter, whom he bargains for, as do"
3091,CANTO XX,The Corsairs for their slaves. O avarice!
3092,CANTO XX,"What canst thou more, who hast subdued our blood"
3093,CANTO XX,"So wholly to thyself, they feel no care"
3094,CANTO XX,Of their own flesh? To hide with direr guilt
3095,CANTO XX,"Past ill and future, lo! the flower-de-luce"
3096,CANTO XX,Enters Alagna! in his Vicar Christ
3097,CANTO XX,"Himself a captive, and his mockery"
3098,CANTO XX,Acted again! Lo! lo his holy lip
3099,CANTO XX,The vinegar and gall once more applied!
3100,CANTO XX,And he ’twixt living robbers doom’d to bleed!
3101,CANTO XX,"Lo! the new Pilate, of whose cruelty"
3102,CANTO XX,"Such violence cannot fill the measure up,"
3103,CANTO XX,"With no degree to sanction, pushes on"
3104,CANTO XX,Into the temple his yet eager sails!
3105,CANTO XX,
3106,CANTO XX,“O sovran Master! when shall I rejoice
3107,CANTO XX,"To see the vengeance, which thy wrath well-pleas’d"
3108,CANTO XX,"In secret silence broods?—While daylight lasts,"
3109,CANTO XX,"So long what thou didst hear of her, sole spouse"
3110,CANTO XX,"Of the Great Spirit, and on which thou turn’dst"
3111,CANTO XX,"To me for comment, is the general theme"
3112,CANTO XX,"Of all our prayers: but when it darkens, then"
3113,CANTO XX,"A different strain we utter, then record"
3114,CANTO XX,"Pygmalion, whom his gluttonous thirst of gold"
3115,CANTO XX,"Made traitor, robber, parricide: the woes"
3116,CANTO XX,"Of Midas, which his greedy wish ensued,"
3117,CANTO XX,Mark’d for derision to all future times:
3118,CANTO XX,"And the fond Achan, how he stole the prey,"
3119,CANTO XX,That yet he seems by Joshua’s ire pursued.
3120,CANTO XX,"Sapphira with her husband next, we blame;"
3121,CANTO XX,"And praise the forefeet, that with furious ramp"
3122,CANTO XX,Spurn’d Heliodorus. All the mountain round
3123,CANTO XX,"Rings with the infamy of Thracia’s king,"
3124,CANTO XX,Who slew his Phrygian charge: and last a shout
3125,CANTO XX,"Ascends: “Declare, O Crassus! for thou know’st,"
3126,CANTO XX,The flavour of thy gold.” The voice of each
3127,CANTO XX,"Now high now low, as each his impulse prompts,"
3128,CANTO XX,"Is led through many a pitch, acute or grave."
3129,CANTO XX,"Therefore, not singly, I erewhile rehears’d"
3130,CANTO XX,That blessedness we tell of in the day:
3131,CANTO XX,But near me none beside his accent rais’d.”
3132,CANTO XX,
3133,CANTO XX,"From him we now had parted, and essay’d"
3134,CANTO XX,"With utmost efforts to surmount the way,"
3135,CANTO XX,"When I did feel, as nodding to its fall,"
3136,CANTO XX,The mountain tremble; whence an icy chill
3137,CANTO XX,"Seiz’d on me, as on one to death convey’d."
3138,CANTO XX,"So shook not Delos, when Latona there"
3139,CANTO XX,Couch’d to bring forth the twin-born eyes of heaven.
3140,CANTO XX,
3141,CANTO XX,Forthwith from every side a shout arose
3142,CANTO XX,"So vehement, that suddenly my guide"
3143,CANTO XX,"Drew near, and cried: “Doubt not, while I conduct thee.”"
3144,CANTO XX,“Glory!” all shouted (such the sounds mine ear
3145,CANTO XX,"Gather’d from those, who near me swell’d the sounds)"
3146,CANTO XX,“Glory in the highest be to God.” We stood
3147,CANTO XX,"Immovably suspended, like to those,"
3148,CANTO XX,"The shepherds, who first heard in Bethlehem’s field"
3149,CANTO XX,"That song: till ceas’d the trembling, and the song"
3150,CANTO XX,"Was ended: then our hallow’d path resum’d,"
3151,CANTO XX,"Eying the prostrate shadows, who renew’d"
3152,CANTO XX,Their custom’d mourning. Never in my breast
3153,CANTO XX,Did ignorance so struggle with desire
3154,CANTO XX,"Of knowledge, if my memory do not err,"
3155,CANTO XX,As in that moment; nor through haste dar’d I
3156,CANTO XX,"To question, nor myself could aught discern,"
3157,CANTO XX,So on I far’d in thoughtfulness and dread.
3158,CANTO XX,
3159,CANTO XX,
3160,CANTO XX,
3161,CANTO XX,
3162,CANTO XXI,CANTO XXI
3163,CANTO XXI,
3164,CANTO XXI,
3165,CANTO XXI,"The natural thirst, ne’er quench’d but from the well,"
3166,CANTO XXI,"Whereof the woman of Samaria crav’d,"
3167,CANTO XXI,"Excited: haste along the cumber’d path,"
3168,CANTO XXI,"After my guide, impell’d; and pity mov’d"
3169,CANTO XXI,"My bosom for the ’vengeful deed, though just."
3170,CANTO XXI,"When lo! even as Luke relates, that Christ"
3171,CANTO XXI,"Appear’d unto the two upon their way,"
3172,CANTO XXI,New-risen from his vaulted grave; to us
3173,CANTO XXI,"A shade appear’d, and after us approach’d,"
3174,CANTO XXI,Contemplating the crowd beneath its feet.
3175,CANTO XXI,"We were not ware of it; so first it spake,"
3176,CANTO XXI,"Saying, “God give you peace, my brethren!” then"
3177,CANTO XXI,"Sudden we turn’d: and Virgil such salute,"
3178,CANTO XXI,"As fitted that kind greeting, gave, and cried:"
3179,CANTO XXI,“Peace in the blessed council be thy lot
3180,CANTO XXI,"Awarded by that righteous court, which me"
3181,CANTO XXI,To everlasting banishment exiles!”
3182,CANTO XXI,
3183,CANTO XXI,"“How!” he exclaim’d, nor from his speed meanwhile"
3184,CANTO XXI,"Desisting, “If that ye be spirits, whom God"
3185,CANTO XXI,"Vouchsafes not room above, who up the height"
3186,CANTO XXI,Has been thus far your guide?” To whom the bard:
3187,CANTO XXI,"“If thou observe the tokens, which this man"
3188,CANTO XXI,"Trac’d by the finger of the angel bears,"
3189,CANTO XXI,’Tis plain that in the kingdom of the just
3190,CANTO XXI,"He needs must share. But sithence she, whose wheel"
3191,CANTO XXI,"Spins day and night, for him not yet had drawn"
3192,CANTO XXI,"That yarn, which, on the fatal distaff pil’d,"
3193,CANTO XXI,"Clotho apportions to each wight that breathes,"
3194,CANTO XXI,"His soul, that sister is to mine and thine,"
3195,CANTO XXI,"Not of herself could mount, for not like ours"
3196,CANTO XXI,"Her ken: whence I, from forth the ample gulf"
3197,CANTO XXI,"Of hell was ta’en, to lead him, and will lead"
3198,CANTO XXI,"Far as my lore avails. But, if thou know,"
3199,CANTO XXI,"Instruct us for what cause, the mount erewhile"
3200,CANTO XXI,Thus shook and trembled: wherefore all at once
3201,CANTO XXI,"Seem’d shouting, even from his wave-wash’d foot.”"
3202,CANTO XXI,
3203,CANTO XXI,"That questioning so tallied with my wish,"
3204,CANTO XXI,The thirst did feel abatement of its edge
3205,CANTO XXI,"E’en from expectance. He forthwith replied,"
3206,CANTO XXI,“In its devotion nought irregular
3207,CANTO XXI,"This mount can witness, or by punctual rule"
3208,CANTO XXI,Unsanction’d; here from every change exempt.
3209,CANTO XXI,"Other than that, which heaven in itself"
3210,CANTO XXI,"Doth of itself receive, no influence"
3211,CANTO XXI,"Can reach us. Tempest none, shower, hail or snow,"
3212,CANTO XXI,"Hoar frost or dewy moistness, higher falls"
3213,CANTO XXI,Than that brief scale of threefold steps: thick clouds
3214,CANTO XXI,Nor scudding rack are ever seen: swift glance
3215,CANTO XXI,"Ne’er lightens, nor Thaumantian Iris gleams,"
3216,CANTO XXI,That yonder often shift on each side heav’n.
3217,CANTO XXI,Vapour adust doth never mount above
3218,CANTO XXI,"The highest of the trinal stairs, whereon"
3219,CANTO XXI,"Peter’s vicegerent stands. Lower perchance,"
3220,CANTO XXI,"With various motion rock’d, trembles the soil:"
3221,CANTO XXI,"But here, through wind in earth’s deep hollow pent,"
3222,CANTO XXI,"I know not how, yet never trembled: then"
3223,CANTO XXI,"Trembles, when any spirit feels itself"
3224,CANTO XXI,"So purified, that it may rise, or move"
3225,CANTO XXI,"For rising, and such loud acclaim ensues."
3226,CANTO XXI,Purification by the will alone
3227,CANTO XXI,"Is prov’d, that free to change society"
3228,CANTO XXI,Seizes the soul rejoicing in her will.
3229,CANTO XXI,Desire of bliss is present from the first;
3230,CANTO XXI,"But strong propension hinders, to that wish"
3231,CANTO XXI,By the just ordinance of heav’n oppos’d;
3232,CANTO XXI,Propension now as eager to fulfil
3233,CANTO XXI,"Th’ allotted torment, as erewhile to sin."
3234,CANTO XXI,And I who in this punishment had lain
3235,CANTO XXI,"Five hundred years and more, but now have felt"
3236,CANTO XXI,Free wish for happier clime. Therefore thou felt’st
3237,CANTO XXI,"The mountain tremble, and the spirits devout"
3238,CANTO XXI,"Heard’st, over all his limits, utter praise"
3239,CANTO XXI,"To that liege Lord, whom I entreat their joy"
3240,CANTO XXI,To hasten.” Thus he spake: and since the draught
3241,CANTO XXI,"Is grateful ever as the thirst is keen,"
3242,CANTO XXI,No words may speak my fullness of content.
3243,CANTO XXI,
3244,CANTO XXI,"“Now,” said the instructor sage, “I see the net"
3245,CANTO XXI,"That takes ye here, and how the toils are loos’d,"
3246,CANTO XXI,Why rocks the mountain and why ye rejoice.
3247,CANTO XXI,"Vouchsafe, that from thy lips I next may learn,"
3248,CANTO XXI,"Who on the earth thou wast, and wherefore here"
3249,CANTO XXI,"So many an age wert prostrate.”—“In that time,"
3250,CANTO XXI,"When the good Titus, with Heav’n’s King to help,"
3251,CANTO XXI,"Aveng’d those piteous gashes, whence the blood"
3252,CANTO XXI,"By Judas sold did issue, with the name"
3253,CANTO XXI,Most lasting and most honour’d there was I
3254,CANTO XXI,"Abundantly renown’d,” the shade reply’d,"
3255,CANTO XXI,“Not yet with faith endued. So passing sweet
3256,CANTO XXI,"My vocal Spirit, from Tolosa, Rome"
3257,CANTO XXI,"To herself drew me, where I merited"
3258,CANTO XXI,A myrtle garland to inwreathe my brow.
3259,CANTO XXI,"Statius they name me still. Of Thebes I sang,"
3260,CANTO XXI,And next of great Achilles: but i’ th’ way
3261,CANTO XXI,Fell with the second burthen. Of my flame
3262,CANTO XXI,"Those sparkles were the seeds, which I deriv’d"
3263,CANTO XXI,From the bright fountain of celestial fire
3264,CANTO XXI,"That feeds unnumber’d lamps, the song I mean"
3265,CANTO XXI,Which sounds Aeneas’ wand’rings: that the breast
3266,CANTO XXI,"I hung at, that the nurse, from whom my veins"
3267,CANTO XXI,Drank inspiration: whose authority
3268,CANTO XXI,Was ever sacred with me. To have liv’d
3269,CANTO XXI,"Coeval with the Mantuan, I would bide"
3270,CANTO XXI,The revolution of another sun
3271,CANTO XXI,Beyond my stated years in banishment.”
3272,CANTO XXI,
3273,CANTO XXI,"The Mantuan, when he heard him, turn’d to me,"
3274,CANTO XXI,And holding silence: by his countenance
3275,CANTO XXI,"Enjoin’d me silence but the power which wills,"
3276,CANTO XXI,Bears not supreme control: laughter and tears
3277,CANTO XXI,"Follow so closely on the passion prompts them,"
3278,CANTO XXI,They wait not for the motions of the will
3279,CANTO XXI,"In natures most sincere. I did but smile,"
3280,CANTO XXI,As one who winks; and thereupon the shade
3281,CANTO XXI,"Broke off, and peer’d into mine eyes, where best"
3282,CANTO XXI,Our looks interpret. “So to good event
3283,CANTO XXI,"Mayst thou conduct such great emprize,” he cried,"
3284,CANTO XXI,"“Say, why across thy visage beam’d, but now,"
3285,CANTO XXI,The lightning of a smile!” On either part
3286,CANTO XXI,"Now am I straiten’d; one conjures me speak,"
3287,CANTO XXI,Th’ other to silence binds me: whence a sigh
3288,CANTO XXI,"I utter, and the sigh is heard. “Speak on;”"
3289,CANTO XXI,"The teacher cried; “and do not fear to speak,"
3290,CANTO XXI,But tell him what so earnestly he asks.”
3291,CANTO XXI,"Whereon I thus: “Perchance, O ancient spirit!"
3292,CANTO XXI,Thou marvel’st at my smiling. There is room
3293,CANTO XXI,For yet more wonder. He who guides my ken
3294,CANTO XXI,"On high, he is that Mantuan, led by whom"
3295,CANTO XXI,Thou didst presume of men and gods to sing.
3296,CANTO XXI,"If other cause thou deem’dst for which I smil’d,"
3297,CANTO XXI,Leave it as not the true one; and believe
3298,CANTO XXI,"Those words, thou spak’st of him, indeed the cause.”"
3299,CANTO XXI,
3300,CANTO XXI,Now down he bent t’ embrace my teacher’s feet;
3301,CANTO XXI,But he forbade him: “Brother! do it not:
3302,CANTO XXI,"Thou art a shadow, and behold’st a shade.”"
3303,CANTO XXI,He rising answer’d thus: “Now hast thou prov’d
3304,CANTO XXI,"The force and ardour of the love I bear thee,"
3305,CANTO XXI,"When I forget we are but things of air,"
3306,CANTO XXI,And as a substance treat an empty shade.”
3307,CANTO XXI,
3308,CANTO XXI,
3309,CANTO XXI,
3310,CANTO XXI,
3311,CANTO XXII,CANTO XXII
3312,CANTO XXII,
3313,CANTO XXII,
3314,CANTO XXII,"Now we had left the angel, who had turn’d"
3315,CANTO XXII,"To the sixth circle our ascending step,"
3316,CANTO XXII,"One gash from off my forehead raz’d: while they,"
3317,CANTO XXII,"Whose wishes tend to justice, shouted forth:"
3318,CANTO XXII,"“Blessed!” and ended with, “I thirst:” and I,"
3319,CANTO XXII,"More nimble than along the other straits,"
3320,CANTO XXII,"So journey’d, that, without the sense of toil,"
3321,CANTO XXII,I follow’d upward the swift-footed shades;
3322,CANTO XXII,When Virgil thus began: “Let its pure flame
3323,CANTO XXII,"From virtue flow, and love can never fail"
3324,CANTO XXII,To warm another’s bosom’ so the light
3325,CANTO XXII,"Shine manifestly forth. Hence from that hour,"
3326,CANTO XXII,"When ’mongst us in the purlieus of the deep,"
3327,CANTO XXII,"Came down the spirit of Aquinum’s hard,"
3328,CANTO XXII,"Who told of thine affection, my good will"
3329,CANTO XXII,Hath been for thee of quality as strong
3330,CANTO XXII,As ever link’d itself to one not seen.
3331,CANTO XXII,Therefore these stairs will now seem short to me.
3332,CANTO XXII,But tell me: and if too secure I loose
3333,CANTO XXII,"The rein with a friend’s license, as a friend"
3334,CANTO XXII,"Forgive me, and speak now as with a friend:"
3335,CANTO XXII,How chanc’d it covetous desire could find
3336,CANTO XXII,"Place in that bosom, ’midst such ample store"
3337,CANTO XXII,"Of wisdom, as thy zeal had treasur’d there?”"
3338,CANTO XXII,
3339,CANTO XXII,"First somewhat mov’d to laughter by his words,"
3340,CANTO XXII,Statius replied: “Each syllable of thine
3341,CANTO XXII,Is a dear pledge of love. Things oft appear
3342,CANTO XXII,"That minister false matters to our doubts,"
3343,CANTO XXII,When their true causes are remov’d from sight.
3344,CANTO XXII,"Thy question doth assure me, thou believ’st"
3345,CANTO XXII,"I was on earth a covetous man, perhaps"
3346,CANTO XXII,Because thou found’st me in that circle plac’d.
3347,CANTO XXII,Know then I was too wide of avarice:
3348,CANTO XXII,"And e’en for that excess, thousands of moons"
3349,CANTO XXII,Have wax’d and wan’d upon my sufferings.
3350,CANTO XXII,And were it not that I with heedful care
3351,CANTO XXII,Noted where thou exclaim’st as if in ire
3352,CANTO XXII,"With human nature, ‘Why, thou cursed thirst"
3353,CANTO XXII,Of gold! dost not with juster measure guide
3354,CANTO XXII,The appetite of mortals?’ I had met
3355,CANTO XXII,The fierce encounter of the voluble rock.
3356,CANTO XXII,Then was I ware that with too ample wing
3357,CANTO XXII,"The hands may haste to lavishment, and turn’d,"
3358,CANTO XXII,"As from my other evil, so from this"
3359,CANTO XXII,In penitence. How many from their grave
3360,CANTO XXII,"Shall with shorn locks arise, who living, aye"
3361,CANTO XXII,"And at life’s last extreme, of this offence,"
3362,CANTO XXII,"Through ignorance, did not repent. And know,"
3363,CANTO XXII,The fault which lies direct from any sin
3364,CANTO XXII,"In level opposition, here With that"
3365,CANTO XXII,Wastes its green rankness on one common heap.
3366,CANTO XXII,"Therefore if I have been with those, who wail"
3367,CANTO XXII,"Their avarice, to cleanse me, through reverse"
3368,CANTO XXII,"Of their transgression, such hath been my lot.”"
3369,CANTO XXII,
3370,CANTO XXII,To whom the sovran of the pastoral song:
3371,CANTO XXII,“While thou didst sing that cruel warfare wag’d
3372,CANTO XXII,"By the twin sorrow of Jocasta’s womb,"
3373,CANTO XXII,"From thy discourse with Clio there, it seems"
3374,CANTO XXII,As faith had not been shine: without the which
3375,CANTO XXII,"Good deeds suffice not. And if so, what sun"
3376,CANTO XXII,"Rose on thee, or what candle pierc’d the dark"
3377,CANTO XXII,"That thou didst after see to hoist the sail,"
3378,CANTO XXII,"And follow, where the fisherman had led?”"
3379,CANTO XXII,
3380,CANTO XXII,"He answering thus: “By thee conducted first,"
3381,CANTO XXII,"I enter’d the Parnassian grots, and quaff’d"
3382,CANTO XXII,Of the clear spring; illumin’d first by thee
3383,CANTO XXII,"Open’d mine eyes to God. Thou didst, as one,"
3384,CANTO XXII,"Who, journeying through the darkness, hears a light"
3385,CANTO XXII,"Behind, that profits not himself, but makes"
3386,CANTO XXII,"His followers wise, when thou exclaimedst, ‘Lo!"
3387,CANTO XXII,A renovated world! Justice return’d!
3388,CANTO XXII,Times of primeval innocence restor’d!
3389,CANTO XXII,And a new race descended from above!’
3390,CANTO XXII,Poet and Christian both to thee I owed.
3391,CANTO XXII,"That thou mayst mark more clearly what I trace,"
3392,CANTO XXII,My hand shall stretch forth to inform the lines
3393,CANTO XXII,"With livelier colouring. Soon o’er all the world,"
3394,CANTO XXII,"By messengers from heav’n, the true belief"
3395,CANTO XXII,"Teem’d now prolific, and that word of thine"
3396,CANTO XXII,"Accordant, to the new instructors chim’d."
3397,CANTO XXII,"Induc’d by which agreement, I was wont"
3398,CANTO XXII,Resort to them; and soon their sanctity
3399,CANTO XXII,"So won upon me, that, Domitian’s rage"
3400,CANTO XXII,"Pursuing them, I mix’d my tears with theirs,"
3401,CANTO XXII,"And, while on earth I stay’d, still succour’d them;"
3402,CANTO XXII,And their most righteous customs made me scorn
3403,CANTO XXII,All sects besides. Before I led the Greeks
3404,CANTO XXII,"In tuneful fiction, to the streams of Thebes,"
3405,CANTO XXII,"I was baptiz’d; but secretly, through fear,"
3406,CANTO XXII,"Remain’d a Christian, and conform’d long time"
3407,CANTO XXII,"To Pagan rites. Five centuries and more,"
3408,CANTO XXII,T for that lukewarmness was fain to pace
3409,CANTO XXII,"Round the fourth circle. Thou then, who hast rais’d"
3410,CANTO XXII,"The covering, which did hide such blessing from me,"
3411,CANTO XXII,"Whilst much of this ascent is yet to climb,"
3412,CANTO XXII,"Say, if thou know, where our old Terence bides,"
3413,CANTO XXII,"Caecilius, Plautus, Varro: if condemn’d"
3414,CANTO XXII,"They dwell, and in what province of the deep.”"
3415,CANTO XXII,"“These,” said my guide, “with Persius and myself,"
3416,CANTO XXII,"And others many more, are with that Greek,"
3417,CANTO XXII,"Of mortals, the most cherish’d by the Nine,"
3418,CANTO XXII,In the first ward of darkness. There ofttimes
3419,CANTO XXII,"We of that mount hold converse, on whose top"
3420,CANTO XXII,For aye our nurses live. We have the bard
3421,CANTO XXII,"Of Pella, and the Teian, Agatho,"
3422,CANTO XXII,"Simonides, and many a Grecian else"
3423,CANTO XXII,Ingarlanded with laurel. Of thy train
3424,CANTO XXII,"Antigone is there, Deiphile,"
3425,CANTO XXII,"Argia, and as sorrowful as erst"
3426,CANTO XXII,"Ismene, and who show’d Langia’s wave:"
3427,CANTO XXII,"Deidamia with her sisters there,"
3428,CANTO XXII,"And blind Tiresias’ daughter, and the bride"
3429,CANTO XXII,Sea-born of Peleus.” Either poet now
3430,CANTO XXII,"Was silent, and no longer by th’ ascent"
3431,CANTO XXII,"Or the steep walls obstructed, round them cast"
3432,CANTO XXII,Inquiring eyes. Four handmaids of the day
3433,CANTO XXII,"Had finish’d now their office, and the fifth"
3434,CANTO XXII,"Was at the chariot-beam, directing still"
3435,CANTO XXII,"Its balmy point aloof, when thus my guide:"
3436,CANTO XXII,"“Methinks, it well behooves us to the brink"
3437,CANTO XXII,"Bend the right shoulder’ circuiting the mount,"
3438,CANTO XXII,As we have ever us’d.” So custom there
3439,CANTO XXII,"Was usher to the road, the which we chose"
3440,CANTO XXII,"Less doubtful, as that worthy shade complied."
3441,CANTO XXII,
3442,CANTO XXII,"They on before me went; I sole pursued,"
3443,CANTO XXII,"List’ning their speech, that to my thoughts convey’d"
3444,CANTO XXII,Mysterious lessons of sweet poesy.
3445,CANTO XXII,But soon they ceas’d; for midway of the road
3446,CANTO XXII,"A tree we found, with goodly fruitage hung,"
3447,CANTO XXII,And pleasant to the smell: and as a fir
3448,CANTO XXII,"Upward from bough to bough less ample spreads,"
3449,CANTO XXII,"So downward this less ample spread, that none."
3450,CANTO XXII,"Methinks, aloft may climb. Upon the side,"
3451,CANTO XXII,"That clos’d our path, a liquid crystal fell"
3452,CANTO XXII,"From the steep rock, and through the sprays above"
3453,CANTO XXII,Stream’d showering. With associate step the bards
3454,CANTO XXII,Drew near the plant; and from amidst the leaves
3455,CANTO XXII,A voice was heard: “Ye shall be chary of me;”
3456,CANTO XXII,And after added: “Mary took more thought
3457,CANTO XXII,"For joy and honour of the nuptial feast,"
3458,CANTO XXII,Than for herself who answers now for you.
3459,CANTO XXII,The women of old Rome were satisfied
3460,CANTO XXII,With water for their beverage. Daniel fed
3461,CANTO XXII,"On pulse, and wisdom gain’d. The primal age"
3462,CANTO XXII,Was beautiful as gold; and hunger then
3463,CANTO XXII,"Made acorns tasteful, thirst each rivulet"
3464,CANTO XXII,"Run nectar. Honey and locusts were the food,"
3465,CANTO XXII,Whereon the Baptist in the wilderness
3466,CANTO XXII,"Fed, and that eminence of glory reach’d"
3467,CANTO XXII,"And greatness, which the’ Evangelist records.”"
3468,CANTO XXII,
3469,CANTO XXII,
3470,CANTO XXII,
3471,CANTO XXII,
3472,CANTO XXIII,CANTO XXIII
3473,CANTO XXIII,
3474,CANTO XXIII,
3475,CANTO XXIII,"On the green leaf mine eyes were fix’d, like his"
3476,CANTO XXIII,Who throws away his days in idle chase
3477,CANTO XXIII,"Of the diminutive, when thus I heard"
3478,CANTO XXIII,The more than father warn me: “Son! our time
3479,CANTO XXIII,Asks thriftier using. Linger not: away.”
3480,CANTO XXIII,
3481,CANTO XXIII,Thereat my face and steps at once I turn’d
3482,CANTO XXIII,"Toward the sages, by whose converse cheer’d"
3483,CANTO XXIII,"I journey’d on, and felt no toil: and lo!"
3484,CANTO XXIII,"A sound of weeping and a song: “My lips,"
3485,CANTO XXIII,"O Lord!” and these so mingled, it gave birth"
3486,CANTO XXIII,"To pleasure and to pain. “O Sire, belov’d!"
3487,CANTO XXIII,Say what is this I hear?” Thus I inquir’d.
3488,CANTO XXIII,
3489,CANTO XXIII,"“Spirits,” said he, “who as they go, perchance,"
3490,CANTO XXIII,Their debt of duty pay.” As on their road
3491,CANTO XXIII,"The thoughtful pilgrims, overtaking some"
3492,CANTO XXIII,"Not known unto them, turn to them, and look,"
3493,CANTO XXIII,"But stay not; thus, approaching from behind"
3494,CANTO XXIII,"With speedier motion, eyed us, as they pass’d,"
3495,CANTO XXIII,"A crowd of spirits, silent and devout."
3496,CANTO XXIII,The eyes of each were dark and hollow: pale
3497,CANTO XXIII,"Their visage, and so lean withal, the bones"
3498,CANTO XXIII,Stood staring thro’ the skin. I do not think
3499,CANTO XXIII,"Thus dry and meagre Erisicthon show’d,"
3500,CANTO XXIII,When pinc’ed by sharp-set famine to the quick.
3501,CANTO XXIII,
3502,CANTO XXIII,"“Lo!” to myself I mus’d, “the race, who lost"
3503,CANTO XXIII,"Jerusalem, when Mary with dire beak"
3504,CANTO XXIII,"Prey’d on her child.” The sockets seem’d as rings,"
3505,CANTO XXIII,From which the gems were drops. Who reads the name
3506,CANTO XXIII,"Of man upon his forehead, there the M"
3507,CANTO XXIII,"Had trac’d most plainly. Who would deem, that scent"
3508,CANTO XXIII,"Of water and an apple, could have prov’d"
3509,CANTO XXIII,"Powerful to generate such pining want,"
3510,CANTO XXIII,Not knowing how it wrought? While now I stood
3511,CANTO XXIII,Wond’ring what thus could waste them (for the cause
3512,CANTO XXIII,Of their gaunt hollowness and scaly rind
3513,CANTO XXIII,Appear’d not) lo! a spirit turn’d his eyes
3514,CANTO XXIII,"In their deep-sunken cell, and fasten’d then"
3515,CANTO XXIII,"On me, then cried with vehemence aloud:"
3516,CANTO XXIII,“What grace is this vouchsaf’d me?” By his looks
3517,CANTO XXIII,I ne’er had recogniz’d him: but the voice
3518,CANTO XXIII,Brought to my knowledge what his cheer conceal’d.
3519,CANTO XXIII,Remembrance of his alter’d lineaments
3520,CANTO XXIII,Was kindled from that spark; and I agniz’d
3521,CANTO XXIII,The visage of Forese. “Ah! respect
3522,CANTO XXIII,"This wan and leprous wither’d skin,” thus he"
3523,CANTO XXIII,"Suppliant implor’d, “this macerated flesh."
3524,CANTO XXIII,Speak to me truly of thyself. And who
3525,CANTO XXIII,"Are those twain spirits, that escort thee there?"
3526,CANTO XXIII,Be it not said thou Scorn’st to talk with me.”
3527,CANTO XXIII,
3528,CANTO XXIII,
3529,CANTO XXIII,"“That face of thine,” I answer’d him, “which dead"
3530,CANTO XXIII,"I once bewail’d, disposes me not less"
3531,CANTO XXIII,"For weeping, when I see It thus transform’d."
3532,CANTO XXIII,"Say then, by Heav’n, what blasts ye thus? The whilst"
3533,CANTO XXIII,"I wonder, ask not Speech from me: unapt"
3534,CANTO XXIII,"Is he to speak, whom other will employs.”"
3535,CANTO XXIII,
3536,CANTO XXIII,"He thus: “The water and tee plant we pass’d,"
3537,CANTO XXIII,"Virtue possesses, by th’ eternal will"
3538,CANTO XXIII,"Infus’d, the which so pines me. Every spirit,"
3539,CANTO XXIII,Whose song bewails his gluttony indulg’d
3540,CANTO XXIII,"Too grossly, here in hunger and in thirst"
3541,CANTO XXIII,"Is purified. The odour, which the fruit,"
3542,CANTO XXIII,"And spray, that showers upon the verdure, breathe,"
3543,CANTO XXIII,Inflames us with desire to feed and drink.
3544,CANTO XXIII,Nor once alone encompassing our route
3545,CANTO XXIII,We come to add fresh fuel to the pain:
3546,CANTO XXIII,"Pain, said I? solace rather: for that will"
3547,CANTO XXIII,"To the tree leads us, by which Christ was led"
3548,CANTO XXIII,"To call Elias, joyful when he paid"
3549,CANTO XXIII,Our ransom from his vein.” I answering thus:
3550,CANTO XXIII,"“Forese! from that day, in which the world"
3551,CANTO XXIII,"For better life thou changedst, not five years"
3552,CANTO XXIII,Have circled. If the power of sinning more
3553,CANTO XXIII,"Were first concluded in thee, ere thou knew’st"
3554,CANTO XXIII,"That kindly grief, which re-espouses us"
3555,CANTO XXIII,"To God, how hither art thou come so soon?"
3556,CANTO XXIII,"I thought to find thee lower, there, where time"
3557,CANTO XXIII,Is recompense for time.” He straight replied:
3558,CANTO XXIII,“To drink up the sweet wormwood of affliction
3559,CANTO XXIII,I have been brought thus early by the tears
3560,CANTO XXIII,"Stream’d down my Nella’s cheeks. Her prayers devout,"
3561,CANTO XXIII,"Her sighs have drawn me from the coast, where oft"
3562,CANTO XXIII,"Expectance lingers, and have set me free"
3563,CANTO XXIII,From th’ other circles. In the sight of God
3564,CANTO XXIII,"So much the dearer is my widow priz’d,"
3565,CANTO XXIII,"She whom I lov’d so fondly, as she ranks"
3566,CANTO XXIII,More singly eminent for virtuous deeds.
3567,CANTO XXIII,"The tract most barb’rous of Sardinia’s isle,"
3568,CANTO XXIII,Hath dames more chaste and modester by far
3569,CANTO XXIII,Than that wherein I left her. O sweet brother!
3570,CANTO XXIII,What wouldst thou have me say? A time to come
3571,CANTO XXIII,"Stands full within my view, to which this hour"
3572,CANTO XXIII,"Shall not be counted of an ancient date,"
3573,CANTO XXIII,When from the pulpit shall be loudly warn’d
3574,CANTO XXIII,"Th’ unblushing dames of Florence, lest they bare"
3575,CANTO XXIII,Unkerchief’d bosoms to the common gaze.
3576,CANTO XXIII,"What savage women hath the world e’er seen,"
3577,CANTO XXIII,"What Saracens, for whom there needed scourge"
3578,CANTO XXIII,"Of spiritual or other discipline,"
3579,CANTO XXIII,To force them walk with cov’ring on their limbs!
3580,CANTO XXIII,"But did they see, the shameless ones, that Heav’n"
3581,CANTO XXIII,"Wafts on swift wing toward them, while I speak,"
3582,CANTO XXIII,Their mouths were op’d for howling: they shall taste
3583,CANTO XXIII,Of Borrow (unless foresight cheat me here)
3584,CANTO XXIII,Or ere the cheek of him be cloth’d with down
3585,CANTO XXIII,Who is now rock’d with lullaby asleep.
3586,CANTO XXIII,"Ah! now, my brother, hide thyself no more,"
3587,CANTO XXIII,Thou seest how not I alone but all
3588,CANTO XXIII,"Gaze, where thou veil’st the intercepted sun.”"
3589,CANTO XXIII,
3590,CANTO XXIII,Whence I replied: “If thou recall to mind
3591,CANTO XXIII,"What we were once together, even yet"
3592,CANTO XXIII,Remembrance of those days may grieve thee sore.
3593,CANTO XXIII,"That I forsook that life, was due to him"
3594,CANTO XXIII,"Who there precedes me, some few evenings past,"
3595,CANTO XXIII,"When she was round, who shines with sister lamp"
3596,CANTO XXIII,"To his, that glisters yonder,” and I show’d"
3597,CANTO XXIII,"The sun. “Tis he, who through profoundest night"
3598,CANTO XXIII,"Of he true dead has brought me, with this flesh"
3599,CANTO XXIII,"As true, that follows. From that gloom the aid"
3600,CANTO XXIII,"Of his sure comfort drew me on to climb,"
3601,CANTO XXIII,"And climbing wind along this mountain-steep,"
3602,CANTO XXIII,Which rectifies in you whate’er the world
3603,CANTO XXIII,"Made crooked and deprav’d I have his word,"
3604,CANTO XXIII,That he will bear me company as far
3605,CANTO XXIII,As till I come where Beatrice dwells:
3606,CANTO XXIII,"But there must leave me. Virgil is that spirit,"
3607,CANTO XXIII,"Who thus hath promis’d,” and I pointed to him;"
3608,CANTO XXIII,"“The other is that shade, for whom so late"
3609,CANTO XXIII,"Your realm, as he arose, exulting shook"
3610,CANTO XXIII,Through every pendent cliff and rocky bound.”
3611,CANTO XXIII,
3612,CANTO XXIII,
3613,CANTO XXIII,
3614,CANTO XXIII,
3615,CANTO XXIV,CANTO XXIV
3616,CANTO XXIV,
3617,CANTO XXIV,
3618,CANTO XXIV,"Our journey was not slacken’d by our talk,"
3619,CANTO XXIV,"Nor yet our talk by journeying. Still we spake,"
3620,CANTO XXIV,"And urg’d our travel stoutly, like a ship"
3621,CANTO XXIV,"When the wind sits astern. The shadowy forms,"
3622,CANTO XXIV,
3623,CANTO XXIV,
3624,CANTO XXIV,"That seem’d things dead and dead again, drew in"
3625,CANTO XXIV,"At their deep-delved orbs rare wonder of me,"
3626,CANTO XXIV,Perceiving I had life; and I my words
3627,CANTO XXIV,"Continued, and thus spake; “He journeys up"
3628,CANTO XXIV,"Perhaps more tardily then else he would,"
3629,CANTO XXIV,"For others’ sake. But tell me, if thou know’st,"
3630,CANTO XXIV,"Where is Piccarda? Tell me, if I see"
3631,CANTO XXIV,"Any of mark, among this multitude,"
3632,CANTO XXIV,"Who eye me thus.”—“My sister (she for whom,"
3633,CANTO XXIV,’Twixt beautiful and good I cannot say
3634,CANTO XXIV,"Which name was fitter ) wears e’en now her crown,"
3635,CANTO XXIV,"And triumphs in Olympus.” Saying this,"
3636,CANTO XXIV,He added: “Since spare diet hath so worn
3637,CANTO XXIV,"Our semblance out, ’t is lawful here to name"
3638,CANTO XXIV,"Each one. This,” and his finger then he rais’d,"
3639,CANTO XXIV,"“Is Buonaggiuna,—Buonaggiuna, he"
3640,CANTO XXIV,"Of Lucca: and that face beyond him, pierc’d"
3641,CANTO XXIV,"Unto a leaner fineness than the rest,"
3642,CANTO XXIV,"Had keeping of the church: he was of Tours,"
3643,CANTO XXIV,And purges by wan abstinence away
3644,CANTO XXIV,Bolsena’s eels and cups of muscadel.”
3645,CANTO XXIV,
3646,CANTO XXIV,"He show’d me many others, one by one,"
3647,CANTO XXIV,"And all, as they were nam’d, seem’d well content;"
3648,CANTO XXIV,For no dark gesture I discern’d in any.
3649,CANTO XXIV,I saw through hunger Ubaldino grind
3650,CANTO XXIV,"His teeth on emptiness; and Boniface,"
3651,CANTO XXIV,That wav’d the crozier o’er a num’rous flock.
3652,CANTO XXIV,"I saw the Marquis, who tad time erewhile"
3653,CANTO XXIV,"To swill at Forli with less drought, yet so"
3654,CANTO XXIV,"Was one ne’er sated. I howe’er, like him,"
3655,CANTO XXIV,"That gazing ’midst a crowd, singles out one,"
3656,CANTO XXIV,So singled him of Lucca; for methought
3657,CANTO XXIV,Was none amongst them took such note of me.
3658,CANTO XXIV,Somewhat I heard him whisper of Gentucca:
3659,CANTO XXIV,"The sound was indistinct, and murmur’d there,"
3660,CANTO XXIV,"Where justice, that so strips them, fix’d her sting."
3661,CANTO XXIV,
3662,CANTO XXIV,"“Spirit!” said I, “it seems as thou wouldst fain"
3663,CANTO XXIV,Speak with me. Let me hear thee. Mutual wish
3664,CANTO XXIV,"To converse prompts, which let us both indulge.”"
3665,CANTO XXIV,
3666,CANTO XXIV,"He, answ’ring, straight began: “Woman is born,"
3667,CANTO XXIV,"Whose brow no wimple shades yet, that shall make"
3668,CANTO XXIV,"My city please thee, blame it as they may."
3669,CANTO XXIV,Go then with this forewarning. If aught false
3670,CANTO XXIV,"My whisper too implied, th’ event shall tell"
3671,CANTO XXIV,"But say, if of a truth I see the man"
3672,CANTO XXIV,"Of that new lay th’ inventor, which begins"
3673,CANTO XXIV,"With ‘Ladies, ye that con the lore of love’.”"
3674,CANTO XXIV,
3675,CANTO XXIV,To whom I thus: “Count of me but as one
3676,CANTO XXIV,"Who am the scribe of love; that, when he breathes,"
3677,CANTO XXIV,"Take up my pen, and, as he dictates, write.”"
3678,CANTO XXIV,
3679,CANTO XXIV,"“Brother!” said he, “the hind’rance which once held"
3680,CANTO XXIV,"The notary with Guittone and myself,"
3681,CANTO XXIV,"Short of that new and sweeter style I hear,"
3682,CANTO XXIV,Is now disclos’d. I see how ye your plumes
3683,CANTO XXIV,"Stretch, as th’ inditer guides them; which, no question,"
3684,CANTO XXIV,"Ours did not. He that seeks a grace beyond,"
3685,CANTO XXIV,Sees not the distance parts one style from other.”
3686,CANTO XXIV,"And, as contented, here he held his peace."
3687,CANTO XXIV,
3688,CANTO XXIV,"Like as the bird, that winter near the Nile,"
3689,CANTO XXIV,"In squared regiment direct their course,"
3690,CANTO XXIV,Then stretch themselves in file for speedier flight;
3691,CANTO XXIV,"Thus all the tribe of spirits, as they turn’d"
3692,CANTO XXIV,"Their visage, faster deaf, nimble alike"
3693,CANTO XXIV,"Through leanness and desire. And as a man,"
3694,CANTO XXIV,"Tir’d With the motion of a trotting steed,"
3695,CANTO XXIV,"Slacks pace, and stays behind his company,"
3696,CANTO XXIV,Till his o’erbreathed lungs keep temperate time;
3697,CANTO XXIV,E’en so Forese let that holy crew
3698,CANTO XXIV,"Proceed, behind them lingering at my side,"
3699,CANTO XXIV,And saying: “When shall I again behold thee?”
3700,CANTO XXIV,
3701,CANTO XXIV,"“How long my life may last,” said I, “I know not;"
3702,CANTO XXIV,"This know, how soon soever I return,"
3703,CANTO XXIV,My wishes will before me have arriv’d.
3704,CANTO XXIV,"Sithence the place, where I am set to live,"
3705,CANTO XXIV,"Is, day by day, more scoop’d of all its good,"
3706,CANTO XXIV,And dismal ruin seems to threaten it.”
3707,CANTO XXIV,
3708,CANTO XXIV,"“Go now,” he cried: “lo! he, whose guilt is most,"
3709,CANTO XXIV,"Passes before my vision, dragg’d at heels"
3710,CANTO XXIV,"Of an infuriate beast. Toward the vale,"
3711,CANTO XXIV,"Where guilt hath no redemption, on it speeds,"
3712,CANTO XXIV,Each step increasing swiftness on the last;
3713,CANTO XXIV,"Until a blow it strikes, that leaveth him"
3714,CANTO XXIV,A corse most vilely shatter’d. No long space
3715,CANTO XXIV,Those wheels have yet to roll” (therewith his eyes
3716,CANTO XXIV,Look’d up to heav’n) “ere thou shalt plainly see
3717,CANTO XXIV,That which my words may not more plainly tell.
3718,CANTO XXIV,I quit thee: time is precious here: I lose
3719,CANTO XXIV,"Too much, thus measuring my pace with shine.”"
3720,CANTO XXIV,
3721,CANTO XXIV,As from a troop of well-rank’d chivalry
3722,CANTO XXIV,"One knight, more enterprising than the rest,"
3723,CANTO XXIV,"Pricks forth at gallop, eager to display"
3724,CANTO XXIV,His prowess in the first encounter prov’d
3725,CANTO XXIV,"So parted he from us with lengthen’d strides,"
3726,CANTO XXIV,"And left me on the way with those twain spirits,"
3727,CANTO XXIV,Who were such mighty marshals of the world.
3728,CANTO XXIV,
3729,CANTO XXIV,When he beyond us had so fled mine eyes
3730,CANTO XXIV,"No nearer reach’d him, than my thought his words,"
3731,CANTO XXIV,"The branches of another fruit, thick hung,"
3732,CANTO XXIV,"And blooming fresh, appear’d. E’en as our steps"
3733,CANTO XXIV,"Turn’d thither, not far off it rose to view."
3734,CANTO XXIV,"Beneath it were a multitude, that rais’d"
3735,CANTO XXIV,"Their hands, and shouted forth I know not What"
3736,CANTO XXIV,"Unto the boughs; like greedy and fond brats,"
3737,CANTO XXIV,"That beg, and answer none obtain from him,"
3738,CANTO XXIV,"Of whom they beg; but more to draw them on,"
3739,CANTO XXIV,He at arm’s length the object of their wish
3740,CANTO XXIV,"Above them holds aloft, and hides it not."
3741,CANTO XXIV,
3742,CANTO XXIV,
3743,CANTO XXIV,"At length, as undeceiv’d they went their way:"
3744,CANTO XXIV,"And we approach the tree, who vows and tears"
3745,CANTO XXIV,"Sue to in vain, the mighty tree. “Pass on,"
3746,CANTO XXIV,"And come not near. Stands higher up the wood,"
3747,CANTO XXIV,"Whereof Eve tasted, and from it was ta’en"
3748,CANTO XXIV,‘this plant.” Such sounds from midst the thickets came.
3749,CANTO XXIV,"Whence I, with either bard, close to the side"
3750,CANTO XXIV,"That rose, pass’d forth beyond. “Remember,” next"
3751,CANTO XXIV,"We heard, “those noblest creatures of the clouds,"
3752,CANTO XXIV,How they their twofold bosoms overgorg’d
3753,CANTO XXIV,Oppos’d in fight to Theseus: call to mind
3754,CANTO XXIV,"The Hebrews, how effeminate they stoop’d"
3755,CANTO XXIV,"To ease their thirst; whence Gideon’s ranks were thinn’d,"
3756,CANTO XXIV,As he to Midian march’d adown the hills.”
3757,CANTO XXIV,
3758,CANTO XXIV,"Thus near one border coasting, still we heard"
3759,CANTO XXIV,"The sins of gluttony, with woe erewhile"
3760,CANTO XXIV,"Reguerdon’d. Then along the lonely path,"
3761,CANTO XXIV,"Once more at large, full thousand paces on"
3762,CANTO XXIV,"We travel’d, each contemplative and mute."
3763,CANTO XXIV,
3764,CANTO XXIV,“Why pensive journey thus ye three alone?”
3765,CANTO XXIV,Thus suddenly a voice exclaim’d: whereat
3766,CANTO XXIV,"I shook, as doth a scar’d and paltry beast;"
3767,CANTO XXIV,Then rais’d my head to look from whence it came.
3768,CANTO XXIV,
3769,CANTO XXIV,"Was ne’er, in furnace, glass, or metal seen"
3770,CANTO XXIV,"So bright and glowing red, as was the shape"
3771,CANTO XXIV,"I now beheld. “If ye desire to mount,”"
3772,CANTO XXIV,"He cried, “here must ye turn. This way he goes,"
3773,CANTO XXIV,Who goes in quest of peace.” His countenance
3774,CANTO XXIV,Had dazzled me; and to my guides I fac’d
3775,CANTO XXIV,"Backward, like one who walks, as sound directs."
3776,CANTO XXIV,
3777,CANTO XXIV,"As when, to harbinger the dawn, springs up"
3778,CANTO XXIV,"On freshen’d wing the air of May, and breathes"
3779,CANTO XXIV,"Of fragrance, all impregn’d with herb and flowers,"
3780,CANTO XXIV,E’en such a wind I felt upon my front
3781,CANTO XXIV,"Blow gently, and the moving of a wing"
3782,CANTO XXIV,"Perceiv’d, that moving shed ambrosial smell;"
3783,CANTO XXIV,"And then a voice: “Blessed are they, whom grace"
3784,CANTO XXIV,"Doth so illume, that appetite in them"
3785,CANTO XXIV,"Exhaleth no inordinate desire,"
3786,CANTO XXIV,Still hung’ring as the rule of temperance wills.”
3787,CANTO XXIV,
3788,CANTO XXIV,
3789,CANTO XXIV,
3790,CANTO XXIV,
3791,CANTO XXV,CANTO XXV
3792,CANTO XXV,
3793,CANTO XXV,
3794,CANTO XXV,"It was an hour, when he who climbs, had need"
3795,CANTO XXV,To walk uncrippled: for the sun had now
3796,CANTO XXV,"To Taurus the meridian circle left,"
3797,CANTO XXV,And to the Scorpion left the night. As one
3798,CANTO XXV,"That makes no pause, but presses on his road,"
3799,CANTO XXV,"Whate’er betide him, if some urgent need"
3800,CANTO XXV,"Impel: so enter’d we upon our way,"
3801,CANTO XXV,"One before other; for, but singly, none"
3802,CANTO XXV,That steep and narrow scale admits to climb.
3803,CANTO XXV,
3804,CANTO XXV,E’en as the young stork lifteth up his wing
3805,CANTO XXV,"Through wish to fly, yet ventures not to quit"
3806,CANTO XXV,"The nest, and drops it; so in me desire"
3807,CANTO XXV,"Of questioning my guide arose, and fell,"
3808,CANTO XXV,"Arriving even to the act, that marks"
3809,CANTO XXV,A man prepar’d for speech. Him all our haste
3810,CANTO XXV,"Restrain’d not, but thus spake the sire belov’d:"
3811,CANTO XXV,"“Fear not to speed the shaft, that on thy lip"
3812,CANTO XXV,Stands trembling for its flight.” Encourag’d thus
3813,CANTO XXV,"I straight began: “How there can leanness come,"
3814,CANTO XXV,Where is no want of nourishment to feed?”
3815,CANTO XXV,
3816,CANTO XXV,"“If thou,” he answer’d, “hadst remember’d thee,"
3817,CANTO XXV,How Meleager with the wasting brand
3818,CANTO XXV,"Wasted alike, by equal fires consum’d,"
3819,CANTO XXV,"This would not trouble thee: and hadst thou thought,"
3820,CANTO XXV,How in the mirror your reflected form
3821,CANTO XXV,"With mimic motion vibrates, what now seems"
3822,CANTO XXV,"Hard, had appear’d no harder than the pulp"
3823,CANTO XXV,Of summer fruit mature. But that thy will
3824,CANTO XXV,"In certainty may find its full repose,"
3825,CANTO XXV,"Lo Statius here! on him I call, and pray"
3826,CANTO XXV,That he would now be healer of thy wound.”
3827,CANTO XXV,
3828,CANTO XXV,“If in thy presence I unfold to him
3829,CANTO XXV,"The secrets of heaven’s vengeance, let me plead"
3830,CANTO XXV,"Thine own injunction, to exculpate me.”"
3831,CANTO XXV,"So Statius answer’d, and forthwith began:"
3832,CANTO XXV,"“Attend my words, O son, and in thy mind"
3833,CANTO XXV,Receive them: so shall they be light to clear
3834,CANTO XXV,"The doubt thou offer’st. Blood, concocted well,"
3835,CANTO XXV,"Which by the thirsty veins is ne’er imbib’d,"
3836,CANTO XXV,"And rests as food superfluous, to be ta’en"
3837,CANTO XXV,"From the replenish’d table, in the heart"
3838,CANTO XXV,"Derives effectual virtue, that informs"
3839,CANTO XXV,"The several human limbs, as being that,"
3840,CANTO XXV,Which passes through the veins itself to make them.
3841,CANTO XXV,"Yet more concocted it descends, where shame"
3842,CANTO XXV,Forbids to mention: and from thence distils
3843,CANTO XXV,In natural vessel on another’s blood.
3844,CANTO XXV,"Then each unite together, one dispos’d"
3845,CANTO XXV,"T’ endure, to act the other, through meet frame"
3846,CANTO XXV,"Of its recipient mould: that being reach’d,"
3847,CANTO XXV,"It ’gins to work, coagulating first;"
3848,CANTO XXV,Then vivifies what its own substance caus’d
3849,CANTO XXV,"To bear. With animation now indued,"
3850,CANTO XXV,The active virtue (differing from a plant
3851,CANTO XXV,"No further, than that this is on the way"
3852,CANTO XXV,And at its limit that) continues yet
3853,CANTO XXV,"To operate, that now it moves, and feels,"
3854,CANTO XXV,As sea sponge clinging to the rock: and there
3855,CANTO XXV,Assumes th’ organic powers its seed convey’d.
3856,CANTO XXV,"‘This is the period, son! at which the virtue,"
3857,CANTO XXV,"That from the generating heart proceeds,"
3858,CANTO XXV,Is pliant and expansive; for each limb
3859,CANTO XXV,Is in the heart by forgeful nature plann’d.
3860,CANTO XXV,"How babe of animal becomes, remains"
3861,CANTO XXV,"For thy consid’ring. At this point, more wise,"
3862,CANTO XXV,"Than thou hast err’d, making the soul disjoin’d"
3863,CANTO XXV,"From passive intellect, because he saw"
3864,CANTO XXV,No organ for the latter’s use assign’d.
3865,CANTO XXV,
3866,CANTO XXV,“Open thy bosom to the truth that comes.
3867,CANTO XXV,"Know soon as in the embryo, to the brain,"
3868,CANTO XXV,"Articulation is complete, then turns"
3869,CANTO XXV,The primal Mover with a smile of joy
3870,CANTO XXV,"On such great work of nature, and imbreathes"
3871,CANTO XXV,"New spirit replete with virtue, that what here"
3872,CANTO XXV,"Active it finds, to its own substance draws,"
3873,CANTO XXV,"And forms an individual soul, that lives,"
3874,CANTO XXV,"And feels, and bends reflective on itself."
3875,CANTO XXV,"And that thou less mayst marvel at the word,"
3876,CANTO XXV,"Mark the sun’s heat, how that to wine doth change,"
3877,CANTO XXV,Mix’d with the moisture filter’d through the vine.
3878,CANTO XXV,
3879,CANTO XXV,"“When Lachesis hath spun the thread, the soul"
3880,CANTO XXV,"Takes with her both the human and divine,"
3881,CANTO XXV,"Memory, intelligence, and will, in act"
3882,CANTO XXV,"Far keener than before, the other powers"
3883,CANTO XXV,"Inactive all and mute. No pause allow’d,"
3884,CANTO XXV,"In wond’rous sort self-moving, to one strand"
3885,CANTO XXV,"Of those, where the departed roam, she falls,"
3886,CANTO XXV,Here learns her destin’d path. Soon as the place
3887,CANTO XXV,"Receives her, round the plastic virtue beams,"
3888,CANTO XXV,Distinct as in the living limbs before:
3889,CANTO XXV,"And as the air, when saturate with showers,"
3890,CANTO XXV,"The casual beam refracting, decks itself"
3891,CANTO XXV,With many a hue; so here the ambient air
3892,CANTO XXV,"Weareth that form, which influence of the soul"
3893,CANTO XXV,"Imprints on it; and like the flame, that where"
3894,CANTO XXV,"The fire moves, thither follows, so henceforth"
3895,CANTO XXV,The new form on the spirit follows still:
3896,CANTO XXV,"Hence hath it semblance, and is shadow call’d,"
3897,CANTO XXV,With each sense even to the sight endued:
3898,CANTO XXV,"Hence speech is ours, hence laughter, tears, and sighs"
3899,CANTO XXV,Which thou mayst oft have witness’d on the mount
3900,CANTO XXV,Th’ obedient shadow fails not to present
3901,CANTO XXV,Whatever varying passion moves within us.
3902,CANTO XXV,And this the cause of what thou marvel’st at.”
3903,CANTO XXV,
3904,CANTO XXV,
3905,CANTO XXV,"Now the last flexure of our way we reach’d,"
3906,CANTO XXV,"And to the right hand turning, other care"
3907,CANTO XXV,Awaits us. Here the rocky precipice
3908,CANTO XXV,"Hurls forth redundant flames, and from the rim"
3909,CANTO XXV,"A blast upblown, with forcible rebuff"
3910,CANTO XXV,"Driveth them back, sequester’d from its bound."
3911,CANTO XXV,
3912,CANTO XXV,"Behoov’d us, one by one, along the side,"
3913,CANTO XXV,"That border’d on the void, to pass; and I"
3914,CANTO XXV,"Fear’d on one hand the fire, on th’ other fear’d"
3915,CANTO XXV,Headlong to fall: when thus th’ instructor warn’d:
3916,CANTO XXV,“Strict rein must in this place direct the eyes.
3917,CANTO XXV,A little swerving and the way is lost.”
3918,CANTO XXV,
3919,CANTO XXV,
3920,CANTO XXV,"Then from the bosom of the burning mass,"
3921,CANTO XXV,“O God of mercy!” heard I sung; and felt
3922,CANTO XXV,No less desire to turn. And when I saw
3923,CANTO XXV,"Spirits along the flame proceeding, I"
3924,CANTO XXV,Between their footsteps and mine own was fain
3925,CANTO XXV,To share by turns my view. At the hymn’s close
3926,CANTO XXV,"They shouted loud, “I do not know a man;”"
3927,CANTO XXV,"Then in low voice again took up the strain,"
3928,CANTO XXV,"Which once more ended, “To the wood,” they cried,"
3929,CANTO XXV,"“Ran Dian, and drave forth Callisto, stung"
3930,CANTO XXV,With Cytherea’s poison:” then return’d
3931,CANTO XXV,"Unto their song; then marry a pair extoll’d,"
3932,CANTO XXV,"Who liv’d in virtue chastely, and the bands"
3933,CANTO XXV,"Of wedded love. Nor from that task, I ween,"
3934,CANTO XXV,Surcease they; whilesoe’er the scorching fire
3935,CANTO XXV,Enclasps them. Of such skill appliance needs
3936,CANTO XXV,"To medicine the wound, that healeth last."
3937,CANTO XXV,
3938,CANTO XXV,
3939,CANTO XXV,
3940,CANTO XXV,
3941,CANTO XXVI,CANTO XXVI
3942,CANTO XXVI,
3943,CANTO XXVI,
3944,CANTO XXVI,"While singly thus along the rim we walk’d,"
3945,CANTO XXVI,Oft the good master warn’d me: “Look thou well.
3946,CANTO XXVI,Avail it that I caution thee.” The sun
3947,CANTO XXVI,Now all the western clime irradiate chang’d
3948,CANTO XXVI,"From azure tinct to white; and, as I pass’d,"
3949,CANTO XXVI,My passing shadow made the umber’d flame
3950,CANTO XXVI,Burn ruddier. At so strange a sight I mark’d
3951,CANTO XXVI,That many a spirit marvel’d on his way.
3952,CANTO XXVI,
3953,CANTO XXVI,"This bred occasion first to speak of me,"
3954,CANTO XXVI,"“He seems,” said they, “no insubstantial frame:”"
3955,CANTO XXVI,"Then to obtain what certainty they might,"
3956,CANTO XXVI,"Stretch’d towards me, careful not to overpass"
3957,CANTO XXVI,"The burning pale. “O thou, who followest"
3958,CANTO XXVI,"The others, haply not more slow than they,"
3959,CANTO XXVI,"But mov’d by rev’rence, answer me, who burn"
3960,CANTO XXVI,"In thirst and fire: nor I alone, but these"
3961,CANTO XXVI,"All for thine answer do more thirst, than doth"
3962,CANTO XXVI,Indian or Aethiop for the cooling stream.
3963,CANTO XXVI,"Tell us, how is it that thou mak’st thyself"
3964,CANTO XXVI,"A wall against the sun, as thou not yet"
3965,CANTO XXVI,Into th’ inextricable toils of death
3966,CANTO XXVI,"Hadst enter’d?” Thus spake one, and I had straight"
3967,CANTO XXVI,"Declar’d me, if attention had not turn’d"
3968,CANTO XXVI,"To new appearance. Meeting these, there came,"
3969,CANTO XXVI,"Midway the burning path, a crowd, on whom"
3970,CANTO XXVI,"Earnestly gazing, from each part I view"
3971,CANTO XXVI,"The shadows all press forward, sev’rally"
3972,CANTO XXVI,"Each snatch a hasty kiss, and then away."
3973,CANTO XXVI,"E’en so the emmets, ’mid their dusky troops,"
3974,CANTO XXVI,"Peer closely one at other, to spy out"
3975,CANTO XXVI,"Their mutual road perchance, and how they thrive."
3976,CANTO XXVI,
3977,CANTO XXVI,"That friendly greeting parted, ere dispatch"
3978,CANTO XXVI,"Of the first onward step, from either tribe"
3979,CANTO XXVI,"Loud clamour rises: those, who newly come,"
3980,CANTO XXVI,"Shout “Sodom and Gomorrah!” these, “The cow"
3981,CANTO XXVI,"Pasiphae enter’d, that the beast she woo’d"
3982,CANTO XXVI,"Might rush unto her luxury.” Then as cranes,"
3983,CANTO XXVI,"That part towards the Riphaean mountains fly,"
3984,CANTO XXVI,"Part towards the Lybic sands, these to avoid"
3985,CANTO XXVI,"The ice, and those the sun; so hasteth off"
3986,CANTO XXVI,"One crowd, advances th’ other; and resume"
3987,CANTO XXVI,"Their first song weeping, and their several shout."
3988,CANTO XXVI,
3989,CANTO XXVI,"Again drew near my side the very same,"
3990,CANTO XXVI,"Who had erewhile besought me, and their looks"
3991,CANTO XXVI,"Mark’d eagerness to listen. I, who twice"
3992,CANTO XXVI,"Their will had noted, spake: “O spirits secure,"
3993,CANTO XXVI,"Whene’er the time may be, of peaceful end!"
3994,CANTO XXVI,"My limbs, nor crude, nor in mature old age,"
3995,CANTO XXVI,"Have I left yonder: here they bear me, fed"
3996,CANTO XXVI,"With blood, and sinew-strung. That I no more"
3997,CANTO XXVI,"May live in blindness, hence I tend aloft."
3998,CANTO XXVI,"There is a dame on high, who wind for us"
3999,CANTO XXVI,"This grace, by which my mortal through your realm"
4000,CANTO XXVI,I bear. But may your utmost wish soon meet
4001,CANTO XXVI,"Such full fruition, that the orb of heaven,"
4002,CANTO XXVI,"Fullest of love, and of most ample space,"
4003,CANTO XXVI,"Receive you, as ye tell (upon my page"
4004,CANTO XXVI,"Henceforth to stand recorded) who ye are,"
4005,CANTO XXVI,"And what this multitude, that at your backs"
4006,CANTO XXVI,"Have past behind us.” As one, mountain-bred,"
4007,CANTO XXVI,"Rugged and clownish, if some city’s walls"
4008,CANTO XXVI,"He chance to enter, round him stares agape,"
4009,CANTO XXVI,Confounded and struck dumb; e’en such appear’d
4010,CANTO XXVI,"Each spirit. But when rid of that amaze,"
4011,CANTO XXVI,(Not long the inmate of a noble heart)
4012,CANTO XXVI,"He, who before had question’d, thus resum’d:"
4013,CANTO XXVI,"“O blessed, who, for death preparing, tak’st"
4014,CANTO XXVI,"Experience of our limits, in thy bark!"
4015,CANTO XXVI,"Their crime, who not with us proceed, was that,"
4016,CANTO XXVI,"For which, as he did triumph, Caesar heard"
4017,CANTO XXVI,"The snout of ‘queen,’ to taunt him. Hence their cry"
4018,CANTO XXVI,"Of ‘Sodom,’ as they parted, to rebuke"
4019,CANTO XXVI,"Themselves, and aid the burning by their shame."
4020,CANTO XXVI,"Our sinning was Hermaphrodite: but we,"
4021,CANTO XXVI,"Because the law of human kind we broke,"
4022,CANTO XXVI,"Following like beasts our vile concupiscence,"
4023,CANTO XXVI,"Hence parting from them, to our own disgrace"
4024,CANTO XXVI,"Record the name of her, by whom the beast"
4025,CANTO XXVI,In bestial tire was acted. Now our deeds
4026,CANTO XXVI,"Thou know’st, and how we sinn’d. If thou by name"
4027,CANTO XXVI,"Wouldst haply know us, time permits not now"
4028,CANTO XXVI,"To tell so much, nor can I. Of myself"
4029,CANTO XXVI,"Learn what thou wishest. Guinicelli I,"
4030,CANTO XXVI,"Who having truly sorrow’d ere my last,"
4031,CANTO XXVI,"Already cleanse me.” With such pious joy,"
4032,CANTO XXVI,As the two sons upon their mother gaz’d
4033,CANTO XXVI,"From sad Lycurgus rescu’d, such my joy"
4034,CANTO XXVI,(Save that I more represt it) when I heard
4035,CANTO XXVI,"From his own lips the name of him pronounc’d,"
4036,CANTO XXVI,"Who was a father to me, and to those"
4037,CANTO XXVI,"My betters, who have ever us’d the sweet"
4038,CANTO XXVI,And pleasant rhymes of love. So nought I heard
4039,CANTO XXVI,"Nor spake, but long time thoughtfully I went,"
4040,CANTO XXVI,"Gazing on him; and, only for the fire,"
4041,CANTO XXVI,Approach’d not nearer. When my eyes were fed
4042,CANTO XXVI,"By looking on him, with such solemn pledge,"
4043,CANTO XXVI,"As forces credence, I devoted me"
4044,CANTO XXVI,Unto his service wholly. In reply
4045,CANTO XXVI,He thus bespake me: “What from thee I hear
4046,CANTO XXVI,"Is grav’d so deeply on my mind, the waves"
4047,CANTO XXVI,"Of Lethe shall not wash it off, nor make"
4048,CANTO XXVI,A whit less lively. But as now thy oath
4049,CANTO XXVI,"Has seal’d the truth, declare what cause impels"
4050,CANTO XXVI,"That love, which both thy looks and speech bewray.”"
4051,CANTO XXVI,
4052,CANTO XXVI,"“Those dulcet lays,” I answer’d, “which, as long"
4053,CANTO XXVI,"As of our tongue the beauty does not fade,"
4054,CANTO XXVI,Shall make us love the very ink that trac’d them.”
4055,CANTO XXVI,
4056,CANTO XXVI,"“Brother!” he cried, and pointed at a shade"
4057,CANTO XXVI,"Before him, “there is one, whose mother speech"
4058,CANTO XXVI,Doth owe to him a fairer ornament.
4059,CANTO XXVI,He in love ditties and the tales of prose
4060,CANTO XXVI,"Without a rival stands, and lets the fools"
4061,CANTO XXVI,"Talk on, who think the songster of Limoges"
4062,CANTO XXVI,O’ertops him. Rumour and the popular voice
4063,CANTO XXVI,"They look to more than truth, and so confirm"
4064,CANTO XXVI,"Opinion, ere by art or reason taught."
4065,CANTO XXVI,Thus many of the elder time cried up
4066,CANTO XXVI,"Guittone, giving him the prize, till truth"
4067,CANTO XXVI,By strength of numbers vanquish’d. If thou own
4068,CANTO XXVI,"So ample privilege, as to have gain’d"
4069,CANTO XXVI,"Free entrance to the cloister, whereof Christ"
4070,CANTO XXVI,"Is Abbot of the college, say to him"
4071,CANTO XXVI,"One paternoster for me, far as needs"
4072,CANTO XXVI,"For dwellers in this world, where power to sin"
4073,CANTO XXVI,No longer tempts us.” Haply to make way
4074,CANTO XXVI,"For one, that follow’d next, when that was said,"
4075,CANTO XXVI,"He vanish’d through the fire, as through the wave"
4076,CANTO XXVI,"A fish, that glances diving to the deep."
4077,CANTO XXVI,
4078,CANTO XXVI,"I, to the spirit he had shown me, drew"
4079,CANTO XXVI,"A little onward, and besought his name,"
4080,CANTO XXVI,"For which my heart, I said, kept gracious room."
4081,CANTO XXVI,He frankly thus began: “Thy courtesy
4082,CANTO XXVI,"So wins on me, I have nor power nor will"
4083,CANTO XXVI,"To hide me. I am Arnault; and with songs,"
4084,CANTO XXVI,"Sorely lamenting for my folly past,"
4085,CANTO XXVI,"Thorough this ford of fire I wade, and see"
4086,CANTO XXVI,"The day, I hope for, smiling in my view."
4087,CANTO XXVI,I pray ye by the worth that guides ye up
4088,CANTO XXVI,"Unto the summit of the scale, in time"
4089,CANTO XXVI,Remember ye my suff’rings.” With such words
4090,CANTO XXVI,He disappear’d in the refining flame.
4091,CANTO XXVI,
4092,CANTO XXVI,
4093,CANTO XXVI,
4094,CANTO XXVI,
4095,CANTO XXVII,CANTO XXVII
4096,CANTO XXVII,
4097,CANTO XXVII,
4098,CANTO XXVII,"Now was the sun so station’d, as when first"
4099,CANTO XXVII,"His early radiance quivers on the heights,"
4100,CANTO XXVII,"Where stream’d his Maker’s blood, while Libra hangs"
4101,CANTO XXVII,"Above Hesperian Ebro, and new fires"
4102,CANTO XXVII,Meridian flash on Ganges’ yellow tide.
4103,CANTO XXVII,
4104,CANTO XXVII,"So day was sinking, when the’ angel of God"
4105,CANTO XXVII,Appear’d before us. Joy was in his mien.
4106,CANTO XXVII,"Forth of the flame he stood upon the brink,"
4107,CANTO XXVII,"And with a voice, whose lively clearness far"
4108,CANTO XXVII,"Surpass’d our human, “Blessed are the pure"
4109,CANTO XXVII,"In heart,” he Sang: then near him as we came,"
4110,CANTO XXVII,"“Go ye not further, holy spirits!” he cried,"
4111,CANTO XXVII,“Ere the fire pierce you: enter in; and list
4112,CANTO XXVII,Attentive to the song ye hear from thence.”
4113,CANTO XXVII,
4114,CANTO XXVII,"I, when I heard his saying, was as one"
4115,CANTO XXVII,"Laid in the grave. My hands together clasp’d,"
4116,CANTO XXVII,"And upward stretching, on the fire I look’d,"
4117,CANTO XXVII,And busy fancy conjur’d up the forms
4118,CANTO XXVII,Erewhile beheld alive consum’d in flames.
4119,CANTO XXVII,
4120,CANTO XXVII,Th’ escorting spirits turn’d with gentle looks
4121,CANTO XXVII,"Toward me, and the Mantuan spake: “My son,"
4122,CANTO XXVII,"Here torment thou mayst feel, but canst not death."
4123,CANTO XXVII,"Remember thee, remember thee, if I"
4124,CANTO XXVII,Safe e’en on Geryon brought thee: now I come
4125,CANTO XXVII,"More near to God, wilt thou not trust me now?"
4126,CANTO XXVII,Of this be sure: though in its womb that flame
4127,CANTO XXVII,"A thousand years contain’d thee, from thy head"
4128,CANTO XXVII,"No hair should perish. If thou doubt my truth,"
4129,CANTO XXVII,"Approach, and with thy hands thy vesture’s hem"
4130,CANTO XXVII,"Stretch forth, and for thyself confirm belief."
4131,CANTO XXVII,"Lay now all fear, O lay all fear aside."
4132,CANTO XXVII,"Turn hither, and come onward undismay’d.”"
4133,CANTO XXVII,"I still, though conscience urg’d’ no step advanc’d."
4134,CANTO XXVII,
4135,CANTO XXVII,"When still he saw me fix’d and obstinate,"
4136,CANTO XXVII,"Somewhat disturb’d he cried: “Mark now, my son,"
4137,CANTO XXVII,From Beatrice thou art by this wall
4138,CANTO XXVII,Divided.” As at Thisbe’s name the eye
4139,CANTO XXVII,Of Pyramus was open’d (when life ebb’d
4140,CANTO XXVII,"Fast from his veins), and took one parting glance,"
4141,CANTO XXVII,While vermeil dyed the mulberry; thus I turn’d
4142,CANTO XXVII,"To my sage guide, relenting, when I heard"
4143,CANTO XXVII,"The name, that springs forever in my breast."
4144,CANTO XXVII,
4145,CANTO XXVII,"He shook his forehead; and, “How long,” he said,"
4146,CANTO XXVII,"“Linger we now?” then smil’d, as one would smile"
4147,CANTO XXVII,"Upon a child, that eyes the fruit and yields."
4148,CANTO XXVII,Into the fire before me then he walk’d;
4149,CANTO XXVII,"And Statius, who erewhile no little space"
4150,CANTO XXVII,"Had parted us, he pray’d to come behind."
4151,CANTO XXVII,
4152,CANTO XXVII,I would have cast me into molten glass
4153,CANTO XXVII,"To cool me, when I enter’d; so intense"
4154,CANTO XXVII,"Rag’d the conflagrant mass. The sire belov’d,"
4155,CANTO XXVII,"To comfort me, as he proceeded, still"
4156,CANTO XXVII,"Of Beatrice talk’d. “Her eyes,” saith he,"
4157,CANTO XXVII,“E’en now I seem to view.” From the other side
4158,CANTO XXVII,"A voice, that sang, did guide us, and the voice"
4159,CANTO XXVII,"Following, with heedful ear, we issued forth,"
4160,CANTO XXVII,"There where the path led upward. “Come,” we heard,"
4161,CANTO XXVII,"“Come, blessed of my Father.” Such the sounds,"
4162,CANTO XXVII,"That hail’d us from within a light, which shone"
4163,CANTO XXVII,"So radiant, I could not endure the view."
4164,CANTO XXVII,"“The sun,” it added, “hastes: and evening comes."
4165,CANTO XXVII,Delay not: ere the western sky is hung
4166,CANTO XXVII,"With blackness, strive ye for the pass.” Our way"
4167,CANTO XXVII,"Upright within the rock arose, and fac’d"
4168,CANTO XXVII,"Such part of heav’n, that from before my steps"
4169,CANTO XXVII,The beams were shrouded of the sinking sun.
4170,CANTO XXVII,
4171,CANTO XXVII,"Nor many stairs were overpass, when now"
4172,CANTO XXVII,By fading of the shadow we perceiv’d
4173,CANTO XXVII,The sun behind us couch’d: and ere one face
4174,CANTO XXVII,Of darkness o’er its measureless expanse
4175,CANTO XXVII,"Involv’d th’ horizon, and the night her lot"
4176,CANTO XXVII,"Held individual, each of us had made"
4177,CANTO XXVII,"A stair his pallet: not that will, but power,"
4178,CANTO XXVII,"Had fail’d us, by the nature of that mount"
4179,CANTO XXVII,"Forbidden further travel. As the goats,"
4180,CANTO XXVII,That late have skipp’d and wanton’d rapidly
4181,CANTO XXVII,"Upon the craggy cliffs, ere they had ta’en"
4182,CANTO XXVII,"Their supper on the herb, now silent lie"
4183,CANTO XXVII,"And ruminate beneath the umbrage brown,"
4184,CANTO XXVII,While noonday rages; and the goatherd leans
4185,CANTO XXVII,"Upon his staff, and leaning watches them:"
4186,CANTO XXVII,"And as the swain, that lodges out all night"
4187,CANTO XXVII,"In quiet by his flock, lest beast of prey"
4188,CANTO XXVII,"Disperse them; even so all three abode,"
4189,CANTO XXVII,"I as a goat and as the shepherds they,"
4190,CANTO XXVII,Close pent on either side by shelving rock.
4191,CANTO XXVII,
4192,CANTO XXVII,
4193,CANTO XXVII,A little glimpse of sky was seen above;
4194,CANTO XXVII,Yet by that little I beheld the stars
4195,CANTO XXVII,In magnitude and rustle shining forth
4196,CANTO XXVII,"With more than wonted glory. As I lay,"
4197,CANTO XXVII,"Gazing on them, and in that fit of musing,"
4198,CANTO XXVII,"Sleep overcame me, sleep, that bringeth oft"
4199,CANTO XXVII,"Tidings of future hap. About the hour,"
4200,CANTO XXVII,"As I believe, when Venus from the east"
4201,CANTO XXVII,"First lighten’d on the mountain, she whose orb"
4202,CANTO XXVII,"Seems always glowing with the fire of love,"
4203,CANTO XXVII,"A lady young and beautiful, I dream’d,"
4204,CANTO XXVII,"Was passing o’er a lea; and, as she came,"
4205,CANTO XXVII,Methought I saw her ever and anon
4206,CANTO XXVII,Bending to cull the flowers; and thus she sang:
4207,CANTO XXVII,"“Know ye, whoever of my name would ask,"
4208,CANTO XXVII,That I am Leah: for my brow to weave
4209,CANTO XXVII,"A garland, these fair hands unwearied ply."
4210,CANTO XXVII,"To please me at the crystal mirror, here"
4211,CANTO XXVII,"I deck me. But my sister Rachel, she"
4212,CANTO XXVII,"Before her glass abides the livelong day,"
4213,CANTO XXVII,"Her radiant eyes beholding, charm’d no less,"
4214,CANTO XXVII,Than I with this delightful task. Her joy
4215,CANTO XXVII,"In contemplation, as in labour mine.”"
4216,CANTO XXVII,
4217,CANTO XXVII,"And now as glimm’ring dawn appear’d, that breaks"
4218,CANTO XXVII,"More welcome to the pilgrim still, as he"
4219,CANTO XXVII,"Sojourns less distant on his homeward way,"
4220,CANTO XXVII,"Darkness from all sides fled, and with it fled"
4221,CANTO XXVII,My slumber; whence I rose and saw my guide
4222,CANTO XXVII,"Already risen. “That delicious fruit,"
4223,CANTO XXVII,Which through so many a branch the zealous care
4224,CANTO XXVII,"Of mortals roams in quest of, shall this day"
4225,CANTO XXVII,Appease thy hunger.” Such the words I heard
4226,CANTO XXVII,From Virgil’s lip; and never greeting heard
4227,CANTO XXVII,So pleasant as the sounds. Within me straight
4228,CANTO XXVII,"Desire so grew upon desire to mount,"
4229,CANTO XXVII,Thenceforward at each step I felt the wings
4230,CANTO XXVII,Increasing for my flight. When we had run
4231,CANTO XXVII,"O’er all the ladder to its topmost round,"
4232,CANTO XXVII,"As there we stood, on me the Mantuan fix’d"
4233,CANTO XXVII,"His eyes, and thus he spake: “Both fires, my son,"
4234,CANTO XXVII,"The temporal and eternal, thou hast seen,"
4235,CANTO XXVII,"And art arriv’d, where of itself my ken"
4236,CANTO XXVII,No further reaches. I with skill and art
4237,CANTO XXVII,Thus far have drawn thee. Now thy pleasure take
4238,CANTO XXVII,"For guide. Thou hast o’ercome the steeper way,"
4239,CANTO XXVII,"O’ercome the straighter. Lo! the sun, that darts"
4240,CANTO XXVII,"His beam upon thy forehead! lo! the herb,"
4241,CANTO XXVII,"The arboreta and flowers, which of itself"
4242,CANTO XXVII,This land pours forth profuse! Till those bright eyes
4243,CANTO XXVII,"With gladness come, which, weeping, made me haste"
4244,CANTO XXVII,"To succour thee, thou mayst or seat thee down,"
4245,CANTO XXVII,Or wander where thou wilt. Expect no more
4246,CANTO XXVII,"Sanction of warning voice or sign from me,"
4247,CANTO XXVII,"Free of thy own arbitrement to choose,"
4248,CANTO XXVII,"Discreet, judicious. To distrust thy sense"
4249,CANTO XXVII,Were henceforth error. I invest thee then
4250,CANTO XXVII,"With crown and mitre, sovereign o’er thyself.”"
4251,CANTO XXVII,
4252,CANTO XXVII,
4253,CANTO XXVII,
4254,CANTO XXVII,
4255,CANTO XXVIII,CANTO XXVIII
4256,CANTO XXVIII,
4257,CANTO XXVIII,
4258,CANTO XXVIII,"Through that celestial forest, whose thick shade"
4259,CANTO XXVIII,With lively greenness the new-springing day
4260,CANTO XXVIII,"Attemper’d, eager now to roam, and search"
4261,CANTO XXVIII,"Its limits round, forthwith I left the bank,"
4262,CANTO XXVIII,Along the champain leisurely my way
4263,CANTO XXVIII,"Pursuing, o’er the ground, that on all sides"
4264,CANTO XXVIII,"Delicious odour breath’d. A pleasant air,"
4265,CANTO XXVIII,"That intermitted never, never veer’d,"
4266,CANTO XXVIII,"Smote on my temples, gently, as a wind"
4267,CANTO XXVIII,"Of softest influence: at which the sprays,"
4268,CANTO XXVIII,"Obedient all, lean’d trembling to that part"
4269,CANTO XXVIII,"Where first the holy mountain casts his shade,"
4270,CANTO XXVIII,"Yet were not so disorder’d, but that still"
4271,CANTO XXVIII,Upon their top the feather’d quiristers
4272,CANTO XXVIII,"Applied their wonted art, and with full joy"
4273,CANTO XXVIII,"Welcom’d those hours of prime, and warbled shrill"
4274,CANTO XXVIII,"Amid the leaves, that to their jocund lays"
4275,CANTO XXVIII,"inept tenor; even as from branch to branch,"
4276,CANTO XXVIII,Along the piney forests on the shore
4277,CANTO XXVIII,"Of Chiassi, rolls the gath’ring melody,"
4278,CANTO XXVIII,When Eolus hath from his cavern loos’d
4279,CANTO XXVIII,"The dripping south. Already had my steps,"
4280,CANTO XXVIII,"Though slow, so far into that ancient wood"
4281,CANTO XXVIII,"Transported me, I could not ken the place"
4282,CANTO XXVIII,"Where I had enter’d, when behold! my path"
4283,CANTO XXVIII,"Was bounded by a rill, which to the left"
4284,CANTO XXVIII,"With little rippling waters bent the grass,"
4285,CANTO XXVIII,That issued from its brink. On earth no wave
4286,CANTO XXVIII,"How clean soe’er, that would not seem to have"
4287,CANTO XXVIII,"Some mixture in itself, compar’d with this,"
4288,CANTO XXVIII,"Transpicuous, clear; yet darkly on it roll’d,"
4289,CANTO XXVIII,"Darkly beneath perpetual gloom, which ne’er"
4290,CANTO XXVIII,Admits or sun or moon light there to shine.
4291,CANTO XXVIII,
4292,CANTO XXVIII,
4293,CANTO XXVIII,My feet advanc’d not; but my wond’ring eyes
4294,CANTO XXVIII,"Pass’d onward, o’er the streamlet, to survey"
4295,CANTO XXVIII,"The tender May-bloom, flush’d through many a hue,"
4296,CANTO XXVIII,"In prodigal variety: and there,"
4297,CANTO XXVIII,"As object, rising suddenly to view,"
4298,CANTO XXVIII,That from our bosom every thought beside
4299,CANTO XXVIII,"With the rare marvel chases, I beheld"
4300,CANTO XXVIII,"A lady all alone, who, singing, went,"
4301,CANTO XXVIII,"And culling flower from flower, wherewith her way"
4302,CANTO XXVIII,Was all o’er painted. “Lady beautiful!
4303,CANTO XXVIII,"Thou, who (if looks, that use to speak the heart,"
4304,CANTO XXVIII,"Are worthy of our trust), with love’s own beam"
4305,CANTO XXVIII,"Dost warm thee,” thus to her my speech I fram’d:"
4306,CANTO XXVIII,“Ah! please thee hither towards the streamlet bend
4307,CANTO XXVIII,"Thy steps so near, that I may list thy song."
4308,CANTO XXVIII,"Beholding thee and this fair place, methinks,"
4309,CANTO XXVIII,I call to mind where wander’d and how look’d
4310,CANTO XXVIII,"Proserpine, in that season, when her child"
4311,CANTO XXVIII,"The mother lost, and she the bloomy spring.”"
4312,CANTO XXVIII,
4313,CANTO XXVIII,"As when a lady, turning in the dance,"
4314,CANTO XXVIII,"Doth foot it featly, and advances scarce"
4315,CANTO XXVIII,One step before the other to the ground;
4316,CANTO XXVIII,Over the yellow and vermilion flowers
4317,CANTO XXVIII,"Thus turn’d she at my suit, most maiden-like,"
4318,CANTO XXVIII,"Valing her sober eyes, and came so near,"
4319,CANTO XXVIII,That I distinctly caught the dulcet sound.
4320,CANTO XXVIII,Arriving where the limped waters now
4321,CANTO XXVIII,"Lav’d the green sward, her eyes she deign’d to raise,"
4322,CANTO XXVIII,"That shot such splendour on me, as I ween"
4323,CANTO XXVIII,"Ne’er glanced from Cytherea’s, when her son"
4324,CANTO XXVIII,Had sped his keenest weapon to her heart.
4325,CANTO XXVIII,Upon the opposite bank she stood and smil’d
4326,CANTO XXVIII,through her graceful fingers shifted still
4327,CANTO XXVIII,"The intermingling dyes, which without seed"
4328,CANTO XXVIII,That lofty land unbosoms. By the stream
4329,CANTO XXVIII,Three paces only were we sunder’d: yet
4330,CANTO XXVIII,"The Hellespont, where Xerxes pass’d it o’er,"
4331,CANTO XXVIII,(A curb for ever to the pride of man)
4332,CANTO XXVIII,Was by Leander not more hateful held
4333,CANTO XXVIII,"For floating, with inhospitable wave"
4334,CANTO XXVIII,"’Twixt Sestus and Abydos, than by me"
4335,CANTO XXVIII,"That flood, because it gave no passage thence."
4336,CANTO XXVIII,
4337,CANTO XXVIII,"“Strangers ye come, and haply in this place,"
4338,CANTO XXVIII,"That cradled human nature in its birth,"
4339,CANTO XXVIII,"Wond’ring, ye not without suspicion view"
4340,CANTO XXVIII,"My smiles: but that sweet strain of psalmody,"
4341,CANTO XXVIII,"‘Thou, Lord! hast made me glad,’ will give ye light,"
4342,CANTO XXVIII,"Which may uncloud your minds. And thou, who stand’st"
4343,CANTO XXVIII,"The foremost, and didst make thy suit to me,"
4344,CANTO XXVIII,Say if aught else thou wish to hear: for I
4345,CANTO XXVIII,Came prompt to answer every doubt of thine.”
4346,CANTO XXVIII,
4347,CANTO XXVIII,She spake; and I replied: “I know not how
4348,CANTO XXVIII,To reconcile this wave and rustling sound
4349,CANTO XXVIII,"Of forest leaves, with what I late have heard"
4350,CANTO XXVIII,Of opposite report.” She answering thus:
4351,CANTO XXVIII,"“I will unfold the cause, whence that proceeds,"
4352,CANTO XXVIII,Which makes thee wonder; and so purge the cloud
4353,CANTO XXVIII,"That hath enwraps thee. The First Good, whose joy"
4354,CANTO XXVIII,"Is only in himself, created man"
4355,CANTO XXVIII,"For happiness, and gave this goodly place,"
4356,CANTO XXVIII,His pledge and earnest of eternal peace.
4357,CANTO XXVIII,"Favour’d thus highly, through his own defect"
4358,CANTO XXVIII,"He fell, and here made short sojourn; he fell,"
4359,CANTO XXVIII,"And, for the bitterness of sorrow, chang’d"
4360,CANTO XXVIII,Laughter unblam’d and ever-new delight.
4361,CANTO XXVIII,"That vapours none, exhal’d from earth beneath,"
4362,CANTO XXVIII,"Or from the waters (which, wherever heat"
4363,CANTO XXVIII,"Attracts them, follow), might ascend thus far"
4364,CANTO XXVIII,"To vex man’s peaceful state, this mountain rose"
4365,CANTO XXVIII,"So high toward the heav’n, nor fears the rage"
4366,CANTO XXVIII,"Of elements contending, from that part"
4367,CANTO XXVIII,"Exempted, where the gate his limit bars."
4368,CANTO XXVIII,Because the circumambient air throughout
4369,CANTO XXVIII,"With its first impulse circles still, unless"
4370,CANTO XXVIII,Aught interpose to cheek or thwart its course;
4371,CANTO XXVIII,"Upon the summit, which on every side"
4372,CANTO XXVIII,To visitation of th’ impassive air
4373,CANTO XXVIII,"Is open, doth that motion strike, and makes"
4374,CANTO XXVIII,Beneath its sway th’ umbrageous wood resound:
4375,CANTO XXVIII,"And in the shaken plant such power resides,"
4376,CANTO XXVIII,That it impregnates with its efficacy
4377,CANTO XXVIII,"The voyaging breeze, upon whose subtle plume"
4378,CANTO XXVIII,That wafted flies abroad; and th’ other land
4379,CANTO XXVIII,"Receiving (as ’t is worthy in itself,"
4380,CANTO XXVIII,"Or in the clime, that warms it), doth conceive,"
4381,CANTO XXVIII,And from its womb produces many a tree
4382,CANTO XXVIII,"Of various virtue. This when thou hast heard,"
4383,CANTO XXVIII,"The marvel ceases, if in yonder earth"
4384,CANTO XXVIII,Some plant without apparent seed be found
4385,CANTO XXVIII,"To fix its fibrous stem. And further learn,"
4386,CANTO XXVIII,"That with prolific foison of all seeds,"
4387,CANTO XXVIII,"This holy plain is fill’d, and in itself"
4388,CANTO XXVIII,Bears fruit that ne’er was pluck’d on other soil.
4389,CANTO XXVIII,"The water, thou behold’st, springs not from vein,"
4390,CANTO XXVIII,"As stream, that intermittently repairs"
4391,CANTO XXVIII,"And spends his pulse of life, but issues forth"
4392,CANTO XXVIII,"From fountain, solid, undecaying, sure;"
4393,CANTO XXVIII,"And by the will omnific, full supply"
4394,CANTO XXVIII,Feeds whatsoe’er On either side it pours;
4395,CANTO XXVIII,On this devolv’d with power to take away
4396,CANTO XXVIII,"Remembrance of offence, on that to bring"
4397,CANTO XXVIII,Remembrance back of every good deed done.
4398,CANTO XXVIII,From whence its name of Lethe on this part;
4399,CANTO XXVIII,On th’ other Eunoe: both of which must first
4400,CANTO XXVIII,Be tasted ere it work; the last exceeding
4401,CANTO XXVIII,All flavours else. Albeit thy thirst may now
4402,CANTO XXVIII,"Be well contented, if I here break off,"
4403,CANTO XXVIII,No more revealing: yet a corollary
4404,CANTO XXVIII,I freely give beside: nor deem my words
4405,CANTO XXVIII,"Less grateful to thee, if they somewhat pass"
4406,CANTO XXVIII,"The stretch of promise. They, whose verse of yore"
4407,CANTO XXVIII,"The golden age recorded and its bliss,"
4408,CANTO XXVIII,"On the Parnassian mountain, of this place"
4409,CANTO XXVIII,"Perhaps had dream’d. Here was man guiltless, here"
4410,CANTO XXVIII,"Perpetual spring and every fruit, and this"
4411,CANTO XXVIII,"The far-fam’d nectar.” Turning to the bards,"
4412,CANTO XXVIII,"When she had ceas’d, I noted in their looks"
4413,CANTO XXVIII,A smile at her conclusion; then my face
4414,CANTO XXVIII,Again directed to the lovely dame.
4415,CANTO XXVIII,
4416,CANTO XXVIII,
4417,CANTO XXVIII,
4418,CANTO XXVIII,
4419,CANTO XXIX,CANTO XXIX
4420,CANTO XXIX,
4421,CANTO XXIX,
4422,CANTO XXIX,"Singing, as if enamour’d, she resum’d"
4423,CANTO XXIX,"And clos’d the song, with “Blessed they whose sins"
4424,CANTO XXIX,"Are cover’d.” Like the wood-nymphs then, that tripp’d"
4425,CANTO XXIX,"Singly across the sylvan shadows, one"
4426,CANTO XXIX,"Eager to view and one to ’scape the sun,"
4427,CANTO XXIX,"So mov’d she on, against the current, up"
4428,CANTO XXIX,"The verdant rivage. I, her mincing step"
4429,CANTO XXIX,"Observing, with as tardy step pursued."
4430,CANTO XXIX,
4431,CANTO XXIX,"Between us not an hundred paces trod,"
4432,CANTO XXIX,"The bank, on each side bending equally,"
4433,CANTO XXIX,Gave me to face the orient. Nor our way
4434,CANTO XXIX,"Far onward brought us, when to me at once"
4435,CANTO XXIX,"She turn’d, and cried: “My brother! look and hearken.”"
4436,CANTO XXIX,And lo! a sudden lustre ran across
4437,CANTO XXIX,"Through the great forest on all parts, so bright"
4438,CANTO XXIX,I doubted whether lightning were abroad;
4439,CANTO XXIX,"But that expiring ever in the spleen,"
4440,CANTO XXIX,"That doth unfold it, and this during still"
4441,CANTO XXIX,"And waxing still in splendor, made me question"
4442,CANTO XXIX,What it might be: and a sweet melody
4443,CANTO XXIX,Ran through the luminous air. Then did I chide
4444,CANTO XXIX,With warrantable zeal the hardihood
4445,CANTO XXIX,"Of our first parent, for that there were earth"
4446,CANTO XXIX,"Stood in obedience to the heav’ns, she only,"
4447,CANTO XXIX,"Woman, the creature of an hour, endur’d not"
4448,CANTO XXIX,Restraint of any veil: which had she borne
4449,CANTO XXIX,"Devoutly, joys, ineffable as these,"
4450,CANTO XXIX,"Had from the first, and long time since, been mine."
4451,CANTO XXIX,
4452,CANTO XXIX,While through that wilderness of primy sweets
4453,CANTO XXIX,"That never fade, suspense I walk’d, and yet"
4454,CANTO XXIX,"Expectant of beatitude more high,"
4455,CANTO XXIX,"Before us, like a blazing fire, the air"
4456,CANTO XXIX,"Under the green boughs glow’d; and, for a song,"
4457,CANTO XXIX,Distinct the sound of melody was heard.
4458,CANTO XXIX,
4459,CANTO XXIX,O ye thrice holy virgins! for your sakes
4460,CANTO XXIX,"If e’er I suffer’d hunger, cold and watching,"
4461,CANTO XXIX,Occasion calls on me to crave your bounty.
4462,CANTO XXIX,Now through my breast let Helicon his stream
4463,CANTO XXIX,Pour copious; and Urania with her choir
4464,CANTO XXIX,Arise to aid me: while the verse unfolds
4465,CANTO XXIX,Things that do almost mock the grasp of thought.
4466,CANTO XXIX,
4467,CANTO XXIX,"Onward a space, what seem’d seven trees of gold,"
4468,CANTO XXIX,The intervening distance to mine eye
4469,CANTO XXIX,Falsely presented; but when I was come
4470,CANTO XXIX,"So near them, that no lineament was lost"
4471,CANTO XXIX,"Of those, with which a doubtful object, seen"
4472,CANTO XXIX,"Remotely, plays on the misdeeming sense,"
4473,CANTO XXIX,"Then did the faculty, that ministers"
4474,CANTO XXIX,"Discourse to reason, these for tapers of gold"
4475,CANTO XXIX,"Distinguish, and it th’ singing trace the sound"
4476,CANTO XXIX,"“Hosanna.” Above, their beauteous garniture"
4477,CANTO XXIX,"Flam’d with more ample lustre, than the moon"
4478,CANTO XXIX,Through cloudless sky at midnight in her full.
4479,CANTO XXIX,
4480,CANTO XXIX,I turn’d me full of wonder to my guide;
4481,CANTO XXIX,And he did answer with a countenance
4482,CANTO XXIX,Charg’d with no less amazement: whence my view
4483,CANTO XXIX,"Reverted to those lofty things, which came"
4484,CANTO XXIX,"So slowly moving towards us, that the bride"
4485,CANTO XXIX,Would have outstript them on her bridal day.
4486,CANTO XXIX,
4487,CANTO XXIX,The lady called aloud: “Why thus yet burns
4488,CANTO XXIX,"Affection in thee for these living, lights,"
4489,CANTO XXIX,And dost not look on that which follows them?”
4490,CANTO XXIX,
4491,CANTO XXIX,"I straightway mark’d a tribe behind them walk,"
4492,CANTO XXIX,"As if attendant on their leaders, cloth’d"
4493,CANTO XXIX,"With raiment of such whiteness, as on earth"
4494,CANTO XXIX,"Was never. On my left, the wat’ry gleam"
4495,CANTO XXIX,"Borrow’d, and gave me back, when there I look’d."
4496,CANTO XXIX,"As in a mirror, my left side portray’d."
4497,CANTO XXIX,
4498,CANTO XXIX,When I had chosen on the river’s edge
4499,CANTO XXIX,"Such station, that the distance of the stream"
4500,CANTO XXIX,Alone did separate me; there I stay’d
4501,CANTO XXIX,"My steps for clearer prospect, and beheld"
4502,CANTO XXIX,"The flames go onward, leaving, as they went,"
4503,CANTO XXIX,The air behind them painted as with trail
4504,CANTO XXIX,Of liveliest pencils! so distinct were mark’d
4505,CANTO XXIX,"All those sev’n listed colours, whence the sun"
4506,CANTO XXIX,"Maketh his bow, and Cynthia her zone."
4507,CANTO XXIX,These streaming gonfalons did flow beyond
4508,CANTO XXIX,"My vision; and ten paces, as I guess,"
4509,CANTO XXIX,Parted the outermost. Beneath a sky
4510,CANTO XXIX,"So beautiful, came foul and-twenty elders,"
4511,CANTO XXIX,"By two and two, with flower-de-luces crown’d."
4512,CANTO XXIX,
4513,CANTO XXIX,
4514,CANTO XXIX,All sang one song: “Blessed be thou among
4515,CANTO XXIX,The daughters of Adam! and thy loveliness
4516,CANTO XXIX,"Blessed for ever!” After that the flowers,"
4517,CANTO XXIX,"And the fresh herblets, on the opposite brink,"
4518,CANTO XXIX,Were free from that elected race; as light
4519,CANTO XXIX,"In heav’n doth second light, came after them"
4520,CANTO XXIX,"Four animals, each crown’d with verdurous leaf."
4521,CANTO XXIX,"With six wings each was plum’d, the plumage full"
4522,CANTO XXIX,"Of eyes, and th’ eyes of Argus would be such,"
4523,CANTO XXIX,"Were they endued with life. Reader, more rhymes"
4524,CANTO XXIX,Will not waste in shadowing forth their form:
4525,CANTO XXIX,"For other need no straitens, that in this"
4526,CANTO XXIX,I may not give my bounty room. But read
4527,CANTO XXIX,"Ezekiel; for he paints them, from the north"
4528,CANTO XXIX,"How he beheld them come by Chebar’s flood,"
4529,CANTO XXIX,"In whirlwind, cloud and fire; and even such"
4530,CANTO XXIX,"As thou shalt find them character’d by him,"
4531,CANTO XXIX,"Here were they; save as to the pennons; there,"
4532,CANTO XXIX,"From him departing, John accords with me."
4533,CANTO XXIX,
4534,CANTO XXIX,"The space, surrounded by the four, enclos’d"
4535,CANTO XXIX,A car triumphal: on two wheels it came
4536,CANTO XXIX,Drawn at a Gryphon’s neck; and he above
4537,CANTO XXIX,"Stretch’d either wing uplifted, ’tween the midst"
4538,CANTO XXIX,"And the three listed hues, on each side three;"
4539,CANTO XXIX,So that the wings did cleave or injure none;
4540,CANTO XXIX,"And out of sight they rose. The members, far"
4541,CANTO XXIX,"As he was bird, were golden; white the rest"
4542,CANTO XXIX,With vermeil intervein’d. So beautiful
4543,CANTO XXIX,"A car in Rome ne’er grac’d Augustus pomp,"
4544,CANTO XXIX,Or Africanus’: e’en the sun’s itself
4545,CANTO XXIX,"Were poor to this, that chariot of the sun"
4546,CANTO XXIX,"Erroneous, which in blazing ruin fell"
4547,CANTO XXIX,"At Tellus’ pray’r devout, by the just doom"
4548,CANTO XXIX,Mysterious of all-seeing Jove. Three nymphs
4549,CANTO XXIX,"at the right wheel, came circling in smooth dance;"
4550,CANTO XXIX,"The one so ruddy, that her form had scarce"
4551,CANTO XXIX,Been known within a furnace of clear flame:
4552,CANTO XXIX,"The next did look, as if the flesh and bones"
4553,CANTO XXIX,Were emerald: snow new-fallen seem’d the third.
4554,CANTO XXIX,
4555,CANTO XXIX,
4556,CANTO XXIX,"Now seem’d the white to lead, the ruddy now;"
4557,CANTO XXIX,"And from her song who led, the others took"
4558,CANTO XXIX,"Their treasure, swift or slow. At th’ other wheel,"
4559,CANTO XXIX,"A band quaternion, each in purple clad,"
4560,CANTO XXIX,"Advanc’d with festal step, as of them one"
4561,CANTO XXIX,"The rest conducted, one, upon whose front"
4562,CANTO XXIX,"Three eyes were seen. In rear of all this group,"
4563,CANTO XXIX,"Two old men I beheld, dissimilar"
4564,CANTO XXIX,"In raiment, but in port and gesture like,"
4565,CANTO XXIX,Solid and mainly grave; of whom the one
4566,CANTO XXIX,Did show himself some favour’d counsellor
4567,CANTO XXIX,"Of the great Coan, him, whom nature made"
4568,CANTO XXIX,To serve the costliest creature of her tribe.
4569,CANTO XXIX,"His fellow mark’d an opposite intent,"
4570,CANTO XXIX,"Bearing a sword, whose glitterance and keen edge,"
4571,CANTO XXIX,"E’en as I view’d it with the flood between,"
4572,CANTO XXIX,"Appall’d me. Next four others I beheld,"
4573,CANTO XXIX,"Of humble seeming: and, behind them all,"
4574,CANTO XXIX,"One single old man, sleeping, as he came,"
4575,CANTO XXIX,"With a shrewd visage. And these seven, each"
4576,CANTO XXIX,"Like the first troop were habited, but wore"
4577,CANTO XXIX,No braid of lilies on their temples wreath’d.
4578,CANTO XXIX,"Rather with roses and each vermeil flower,"
4579,CANTO XXIX,"A sight, but little distant, might have sworn,"
4580,CANTO XXIX,That they were all on fire above their brow.
4581,CANTO XXIX,
4582,CANTO XXIX,"Whenas the car was o’er against me, straight."
4583,CANTO XXIX,"Was heard a thund’ring, at whose voice it seem’d"
4584,CANTO XXIX,"The chosen multitude were stay’d; for there,"
4585,CANTO XXIX,"With the first ensigns, made they solemn halt."
4586,CANTO XXIX,
4587,CANTO XXIX,
4588,CANTO XXIX,
4589,CANTO XXIX,
4590,CANTO XXX,CANTO XXX
4591,CANTO XXX,
4592,CANTO XXX,
4593,CANTO XXX,"Soon as the polar light, which never knows"
4594,CANTO XXX,"Setting nor rising, nor the shadowy veil"
4595,CANTO XXX,"Of other cloud than sin, fair ornament"
4596,CANTO XXX,"Of the first heav’n, to duty each one there"
4597,CANTO XXX,"Safely convoying, as that lower doth"
4598,CANTO XXX,"The steersman to his port, stood firmly fix’d;"
4599,CANTO XXX,"Forthwith the saintly tribe, who in the van"
4600,CANTO XXX,"Between the Gryphon and its radiance came,"
4601,CANTO XXX,"Did turn them to the car, as to their rest:"
4602,CANTO XXX,"And one, as if commission’d from above,"
4603,CANTO XXX,In holy chant thrice shorted forth aloud:
4604,CANTO XXX,"“Come, spouse, from Libanus!” and all the rest"
4605,CANTO XXX,Took up the song—At the last audit so
4606,CANTO XXX,"The blest shall rise, from forth his cavern each"
4607,CANTO XXX,"Uplifting lightly his new-vested flesh,"
4608,CANTO XXX,"As, on the sacred litter, at the voice"
4609,CANTO XXX,"Authoritative of that elder, sprang"
4610,CANTO XXX,A hundred ministers and messengers
4611,CANTO XXX,Of life eternal. “Blessed thou! who com’st!”
4612,CANTO XXX,"And, “O,” they cried, “from full hands scatter ye"
4613,CANTO XXX,"Unwith’ring lilies;” and, so saying, cast"
4614,CANTO XXX,Flowers over head and round them on all sides.
4615,CANTO XXX,
4616,CANTO XXX,"I have beheld, ere now, at break of day,"
4617,CANTO XXX,"The eastern clime all roseate, and the sky"
4618,CANTO XXX,"Oppos’d, one deep and beautiful serene,"
4619,CANTO XXX,"And the sun’s face so shaded, and with mists"
4620,CANTO XXX,"Attemper’d at lids rising, that the eye"
4621,CANTO XXX,Long while endur’d the sight: thus in a cloud
4622,CANTO XXX,"Of flowers, that from those hands angelic rose,"
4623,CANTO XXX,"And down, within and outside of the car,"
4624,CANTO XXX,"Fell showering, in white veil with olive wreath’d,"
4625,CANTO XXX,"A virgin in my view appear’d, beneath"
4626,CANTO XXX,"Green mantle, rob’d in hue of living flame:"
4627,CANTO XXX,
4628,CANTO XXX,
4629,CANTO XXX,"And o’er my Spirit, that in former days"
4630,CANTO XXX,"Within her presence had abode so long,"
4631,CANTO XXX,No shudd’ring terror crept. Mine eyes no more
4632,CANTO XXX,Had knowledge of her; yet there mov’d from her
4633,CANTO XXX,"A hidden virtue, at whose touch awak’d,"
4634,CANTO XXX,The power of ancient love was strong within me.
4635,CANTO XXX,
4636,CANTO XXX,"No sooner on my vision streaming, smote"
4637,CANTO XXX,"The heav’nly influence, which years past, and e’en"
4638,CANTO XXX,"In childhood, thrill’d me, than towards Virgil I"
4639,CANTO XXX,"Turn’d me to leftward, panting, like a babe,"
4640,CANTO XXX,"That flees for refuge to his mother’s breast,"
4641,CANTO XXX,If aught have terrified or work’d him woe:
4642,CANTO XXX,"And would have cried: “There is no dram of blood,"
4643,CANTO XXX,That doth not quiver in me. The old flame
4644,CANTO XXX,Throws out clear tokens of reviving fire:”
4645,CANTO XXX,"But Virgil had bereav’d us of himself,"
4646,CANTO XXX,"Virgil, my best-lov’d father; Virgil, he"
4647,CANTO XXX,"To whom I gave me up for safety: nor,"
4648,CANTO XXX,"All, our prime mother lost, avail’d to save"
4649,CANTO XXX,My undew’d cheeks from blur of soiling tears.
4650,CANTO XXX,
4651,CANTO XXX,"“Dante, weep not, that Virgil leaves thee: nay,"
4652,CANTO XXX,Weep thou not yet: behooves thee feel the edge
4653,CANTO XXX,"Of other sword, and thou shalt weep for that.”"
4654,CANTO XXX,
4655,CANTO XXX,"As to the prow or stern, some admiral"
4656,CANTO XXX,"Paces the deck, inspiriting his crew,"
4657,CANTO XXX,When ’mid the sail-yards all hands ply aloof;
4658,CANTO XXX,"Thus on the left side of the car I saw,"
4659,CANTO XXX,"(Turning me at the sound of mine own name,"
4660,CANTO XXX,Which here I am compell’d to register)
4661,CANTO XXX,"The virgin station’d, who before appeared"
4662,CANTO XXX,Veil’d in that festive shower angelical.
4663,CANTO XXX,
4664,CANTO XXX,"Towards me, across the stream, she bent her eyes;"
4665,CANTO XXX,"Though from her brow the veil descending, bound"
4666,CANTO XXX,"With foliage of Minerva, suffer’d not"
4667,CANTO XXX,That I beheld her clearly; then with act
4668,CANTO XXX,"Full royal, still insulting o’er her thrall,"
4669,CANTO XXX,"Added, as one, who speaking keepeth back"
4670,CANTO XXX,"The bitterest saying, to conclude the speech:"
4671,CANTO XXX,"“Observe me well. I am, in sooth, I am"
4672,CANTO XXX,Beatrice. What! and hast thou deign’d at last
4673,CANTO XXX,"Approach the mountain? knewest not, O man!"
4674,CANTO XXX,Thy happiness is whole?” Down fell mine eyes
4675,CANTO XXX,"On the clear fount, but there, myself espying,"
4676,CANTO XXX,"Recoil’d, and sought the greensward: such a weight"
4677,CANTO XXX,Of shame was on my forehead. With a mien
4678,CANTO XXX,"Of that stern majesty, which doth surround"
4679,CANTO XXX,"mother’s presence to her awe-struck child,"
4680,CANTO XXX,She look’d; a flavour of such bitterness
4681,CANTO XXX,Was mingled in her pity. There her words
4682,CANTO XXX,"Brake off, and suddenly the angels sang:"
4683,CANTO XXX,"“In thee, O gracious Lord, my hope hath been:”"
4684,CANTO XXX,"But went no farther than, “Thou Lord, hast set"
4685,CANTO XXX,"My feet in ample room.” As snow, that lies"
4686,CANTO XXX,Amidst the living rafters on the back
4687,CANTO XXX,Of Italy congeal’d when drifted high
4688,CANTO XXX,"And closely pil’d by rough Sclavonian blasts,"
4689,CANTO XXX,"Breathe but the land whereon no shadow falls,"
4690,CANTO XXX,"And straightway melting it distils away,"
4691,CANTO XXX,"Like a fire-wasted taper: thus was I,"
4692,CANTO XXX,"Without a sigh or tear, or ever these"
4693,CANTO XXX,"Did sing, that with the chiming of heav’n’s sphere,"
4694,CANTO XXX,Still in their warbling chime: but when the strain
4695,CANTO XXX,"Of dulcet symphony, express’d for me"
4696,CANTO XXX,"Their soft compassion, more than could the words"
4697,CANTO XXX,"“Virgin, why so consum’st him?” then the ice,"
4698,CANTO XXX,"Congeal’d about my bosom, turn’d itself"
4699,CANTO XXX,"To spirit and water, and with anguish forth"
4700,CANTO XXX,Gush’d through the lips and eyelids from the heart.
4701,CANTO XXX,
4702,CANTO XXX,"Upon the chariot’s right edge still she stood,"
4703,CANTO XXX,"Immovable, and thus address’d her words"
4704,CANTO XXX,To those bright semblances with pity touch’d:
4705,CANTO XXX,"“Ye in th’ eternal day your vigils keep,"
4706,CANTO XXX,"So that nor night nor slumber, with close stealth,"
4707,CANTO XXX,Conveys from you a single step in all
4708,CANTO XXX,The goings on of life: thence with more heed
4709,CANTO XXX,"I shape mine answer, for his ear intended,"
4710,CANTO XXX,"Who there stands weeping, that the sorrow now"
4711,CANTO XXX,May equal the transgression. Not alone
4712,CANTO XXX,"Through operation of the mighty orbs,"
4713,CANTO XXX,"That mark each seed to some predestin’d aim,"
4714,CANTO XXX,As with aspect or fortunate or ill
4715,CANTO XXX,"The constellations meet, but through benign"
4716,CANTO XXX,"Largess of heav’nly graces, which rain down"
4717,CANTO XXX,"From such a height, as mocks our vision, this man"
4718,CANTO XXX,"Was in the freshness of his being, such,"
4719,CANTO XXX,"So gifted virtually, that in him"
4720,CANTO XXX,All better habits wond’rously had thriv’d.
4721,CANTO XXX,"The more of kindly strength is in the soil,"
4722,CANTO XXX,So much doth evil seed and lack of culture
4723,CANTO XXX,"Mar it the more, and make it run to wildness."
4724,CANTO XXX,These looks sometime upheld him; for I show’d
4725,CANTO XXX,"My youthful eyes, and led him by their light"
4726,CANTO XXX,In upright walking. Soon as I had reach’d
4727,CANTO XXX,"The threshold of my second age, and chang’d"
4728,CANTO XXX,"My mortal for immortal, then he left me,"
4729,CANTO XXX,And gave himself to others. When from flesh
4730,CANTO XXX,"To spirit I had risen, and increase"
4731,CANTO XXX,"Of beauty and of virtue circled me,"
4732,CANTO XXX,"I was less dear to him, and valued less."
4733,CANTO XXX,"His steps were turn’d into deceitful ways,"
4734,CANTO XXX,"Following false images of good, that make"
4735,CANTO XXX,No promise perfect. Nor avail’d me aught
4736,CANTO XXX,"To sue for inspirations, with the which,"
4737,CANTO XXX,"I, both in dreams of night, and otherwise,"
4738,CANTO XXX,"Did call him back; of them so little reck’d him,"
4739,CANTO XXX,"Such depth he fell, that all device was short"
4740,CANTO XXX,"Of his preserving, save that he should view"
4741,CANTO XXX,The children of perdition. To this end
4742,CANTO XXX,I visited the purlieus of the dead:
4743,CANTO XXX,"And one, who hath conducted him thus high,"
4744,CANTO XXX,Receiv’d my supplications urg’d with weeping.
4745,CANTO XXX,"It were a breaking of God’s high decree,"
4746,CANTO XXX,"If Lethe should be past, and such food tasted"
4747,CANTO XXX,Without the cost of some repentant tear.”
4748,CANTO XXX,
4749,CANTO XXX,
4750,CANTO XXX,
4751,CANTO XXX,
4752,CANTO XXXI,CANTO XXXI
4753,CANTO XXXI,
4754,CANTO XXXI,
4755,CANTO XXXI,“O Thou!” her words she thus without delay
4756,CANTO XXXI,"Resuming, turn’d their point on me, to whom"
4757,CANTO XXXI,"They but with lateral edge seem’d harsh before,"
4758,CANTO XXXI,"“Say thou, who stand’st beyond the holy stream,"
4759,CANTO XXXI,If this be true. A charge so grievous needs
4760,CANTO XXXI,Thine own avowal.” On my faculty
4761,CANTO XXXI,"Such strange amazement hung, the voice expir’d"
4762,CANTO XXXI,"Imperfect, ere its organs gave it birth."
4763,CANTO XXXI,
4764,CANTO XXXI,"A little space refraining, then she spake:"
4765,CANTO XXXI,“What dost thou muse on? Answer me. The wave
4766,CANTO XXXI,On thy remembrances of evil yet
4767,CANTO XXXI,Hath done no injury.” A mingled sense
4768,CANTO XXXI,"Of fear and of confusion, from my lips"
4769,CANTO XXXI,"Did such a “Yea” produce, as needed help"
4770,CANTO XXXI,Of vision to interpret. As when breaks
4771,CANTO XXXI,"In act to be discharg’d, a cross-bow bent"
4772,CANTO XXXI,"Beyond its pitch, both nerve and bow o’erstretch’d,"
4773,CANTO XXXI,The flagging weapon feebly hits the mark;
4774,CANTO XXXI,"Thus, tears and sighs forth gushing, did I burst"
4775,CANTO XXXI,"Beneath the heavy load, and thus my voice"
4776,CANTO XXXI,Was slacken’d on its way. She straight began:
4777,CANTO XXXI,“When my desire invited thee to love
4778,CANTO XXXI,"The good, which sets a bound to our aspirings,"
4779,CANTO XXXI,What bar of thwarting foss or linked chain
4780,CANTO XXXI,"Did meet thee, that thou so should’st quit the hope"
4781,CANTO XXXI,"Of further progress, or what bait of ease"
4782,CANTO XXXI,Or promise of allurement led thee on
4783,CANTO XXXI,"Elsewhere, that thou elsewhere should’st rather wait?”"
4784,CANTO XXXI,
4785,CANTO XXXI,"A bitter sigh I drew, then scarce found voice"
4786,CANTO XXXI,"To answer, hardly to these sounds my lips"
4787,CANTO XXXI,"Gave utterance, wailing: “Thy fair looks withdrawn,"
4788,CANTO XXXI,"Things present, with deceitful pleasures, turn’d"
4789,CANTO XXXI,My steps aside.” She answering spake: “Hadst thou
4790,CANTO XXXI,"Been silent, or denied what thou avow’st,"
4791,CANTO XXXI,Thou hadst not hid thy sin the more: such eye
4792,CANTO XXXI,Observes it. But whene’er the sinner’s cheek
4793,CANTO XXXI,Breaks forth into the precious-streaming tears
4794,CANTO XXXI,"Of self-accusing, in our court the wheel"
4795,CANTO XXXI,Of justice doth run counter to the edge.
4796,CANTO XXXI,Howe’er that thou may’st profit by thy shame
4797,CANTO XXXI,"For errors past, and that henceforth more strength"
4798,CANTO XXXI,"May arm thee, when thou hear’st the Siren-voice,"
4799,CANTO XXXI,"Lay thou aside the motive to this grief,"
4800,CANTO XXXI,"And lend attentive ear, while I unfold"
4801,CANTO XXXI,How opposite a way my buried flesh
4802,CANTO XXXI,Should have impell’d thee. Never didst thou spy
4803,CANTO XXXI,"In art or nature aught so passing sweet,"
4804,CANTO XXXI,"As were the limbs, that in their beauteous frame"
4805,CANTO XXXI,"Enclos’d me, and are scatter’d now in dust."
4806,CANTO XXXI,"If sweetest thing thus fail’d thee with my death,"
4807,CANTO XXXI,"What, afterward, of mortal should thy wish"
4808,CANTO XXXI,Have tempted? When thou first hadst felt the dart
4809,CANTO XXXI,"Of perishable things, in my departing"
4810,CANTO XXXI,"For better realms, thy wing thou should’st have prun’d"
4811,CANTO XXXI,"To follow me, and never stoop’d again"
4812,CANTO XXXI,"To ’bide a second blow for a slight girl,"
4813,CANTO XXXI,Or other gaud as transient and as vain.
4814,CANTO XXXI,"The new and inexperienc’d bird awaits,"
4815,CANTO XXXI,"Twice it may be, or thrice, the fowler’s aim;"
4816,CANTO XXXI,"But in the sight of one, whose plumes are full,"
4817,CANTO XXXI,"In vain the net is spread, the arrow wing’d.”"
4818,CANTO XXXI,
4819,CANTO XXXI,"I stood, as children silent and asham’d"
4820,CANTO XXXI,"Stand, list’ning, with their eyes upon the earth,"
4821,CANTO XXXI,Acknowledging their fault and self-condemn’d.
4822,CANTO XXXI,"And she resum’d: “If, but to hear thus pains thee,"
4823,CANTO XXXI,"Raise thou thy beard, and lo! what sight shall do!”"
4824,CANTO XXXI,
4825,CANTO XXXI,"With less reluctance yields a sturdy holm,"
4826,CANTO XXXI,"Rent from its fibers by a blast, that blows"
4827,CANTO XXXI,"From off the pole, or from Iarbas’ land,"
4828,CANTO XXXI,Than I at her behest my visage rais’d:
4829,CANTO XXXI,"And thus the face denoting by the beard,"
4830,CANTO XXXI,I mark’d the secret sting her words convey’d.
4831,CANTO XXXI,
4832,CANTO XXXI,"No sooner lifted I mine aspect up,"
4833,CANTO XXXI,Than downward sunk that vision I beheld
4834,CANTO XXXI,Of goodly creatures vanish; and mine eyes
4835,CANTO XXXI,"Yet unassur’d and wavering, bent their light"
4836,CANTO XXXI,"On Beatrice. Towards the animal,"
4837,CANTO XXXI,"Who joins two natures in one form, she turn’d,"
4838,CANTO XXXI,"And, even under shadow of her veil,"
4839,CANTO XXXI,"And parted by the verdant rill, that flow’d"
4840,CANTO XXXI,"Between, in loveliness appear’d as much"
4841,CANTO XXXI,"Her former self surpassing, as on earth"
4842,CANTO XXXI,All others she surpass’d. Remorseful goads
4843,CANTO XXXI,"Shot sudden through me. Each thing else, the more"
4844,CANTO XXXI,"Its love had late beguil’d me, now the more"
4845,CANTO XXXI,I Was loathsome. On my heart so keenly smote
4846,CANTO XXXI,"The bitter consciousness, that on the ground"
4847,CANTO XXXI,"O’erpower’d I fell: and what my state was then,"
4848,CANTO XXXI,She knows who was the cause. When now my strength
4849,CANTO XXXI,"Flow’d back, returning outward from the heart,"
4850,CANTO XXXI,"The lady, whom alone I first had seen,"
4851,CANTO XXXI,"I found above me. “Loose me not,” she cried:"
4852,CANTO XXXI,“Loose not thy hold;” and lo! had dragg’d me high
4853,CANTO XXXI,"As to my neck into the stream, while she,"
4854,CANTO XXXI,"Still as she drew me after, swept along,"
4855,CANTO XXXI,"Swift as a shuttle, bounding o’er the wave."
4856,CANTO XXXI,
4857,CANTO XXXI,
4858,CANTO XXXI,The blessed shore approaching then was heard
4859,CANTO XXXI,"So sweetly, “Tu asperges me,” that I"
4860,CANTO XXXI,"May not remember, much less tell the sound."
4861,CANTO XXXI,"The beauteous dame, her arms expanding, clasp’d"
4862,CANTO XXXI,"My temples, and immerg’d me, where ’t was fit"
4863,CANTO XXXI,"The wave should drench me: and thence raising up,"
4864,CANTO XXXI,Within the fourfold dance of lovely nymphs
4865,CANTO XXXI,"Presented me so lav’d, and with their arm"
4866,CANTO XXXI,"They each did cover me. “Here are we nymphs,"
4867,CANTO XXXI,And in the heav’n are stars. Or ever earth
4868,CANTO XXXI,"Was visited of Beatrice, we"
4869,CANTO XXXI,"Appointed for her handmaids, tended on her."
4870,CANTO XXXI,We to her eyes will lead thee; but the light
4871,CANTO XXXI,"Of gladness that is in them, well to scan,"
4872,CANTO XXXI,"Those yonder three, of deeper ken than ours,"
4873,CANTO XXXI,Thy sight shall quicken.” Thus began their song;
4874,CANTO XXXI,"And then they led me to the Gryphon’s breast,"
4875,CANTO XXXI,"While, turn’d toward us, Beatrice stood."
4876,CANTO XXXI,“Spare not thy vision. We have stationed thee
4877,CANTO XXXI,"Before the emeralds, whence love erewhile"
4878,CANTO XXXI,"Hath drawn his weapons on thee.” As they spake,"
4879,CANTO XXXI,A thousand fervent wishes riveted
4880,CANTO XXXI,"Mine eyes upon her beaming eyes, that stood"
4881,CANTO XXXI,Still fix’d toward the Gryphon motionless.
4882,CANTO XXXI,"As the sun strikes a mirror, even thus"
4883,CANTO XXXI,"Within those orbs the twofold being, shone,"
4884,CANTO XXXI,"For ever varying, in one figure now"
4885,CANTO XXXI,"Reflected, now in other. Reader! muse"
4886,CANTO XXXI,How wond’rous in my sight it seem’d to mark
4887,CANTO XXXI,"A thing, albeit steadfast in itself,"
4888,CANTO XXXI,Yet in its imag’d semblance mutable.
4889,CANTO XXXI,
4890,CANTO XXXI,"Full of amaze, and joyous, while my soul"
4891,CANTO XXXI,"Fed on the viand, whereof still desire"
4892,CANTO XXXI,"Grows with satiety, the other three"
4893,CANTO XXXI,"With gesture, that declar’d a loftier line,"
4894,CANTO XXXI,Advanc’d: to their own carol on they came
4895,CANTO XXXI,Dancing in festive ring angelical.
4896,CANTO XXXI,
4897,CANTO XXXI,"“Turn, Beatrice!” was their song: “O turn"
4898,CANTO XXXI,"Thy saintly sight on this thy faithful one,"
4899,CANTO XXXI,Who to behold thee many a wearisome pace
4900,CANTO XXXI,Hath measur’d. Gracious at our pray’r vouchsafe
4901,CANTO XXXI,Unveil to him thy cheeks: that he may mark
4902,CANTO XXXI,"Thy second beauty, now conceal’d.” O splendour!"
4903,CANTO XXXI,O sacred light eternal! who is he
4904,CANTO XXXI,"So pale with musing in Pierian shades,"
4905,CANTO XXXI,"Or with that fount so lavishly imbued,"
4906,CANTO XXXI,Whose spirit should not fail him in th’ essay
4907,CANTO XXXI,"To represent thee such as thou didst seem,"
4908,CANTO XXXI,When under cope of the still-chiming heaven
4909,CANTO XXXI,Thou gav’st to open air thy charms reveal’d.
4910,CANTO XXXI,
4911,CANTO XXXI,
4912,CANTO XXXI,
4913,CANTO XXXI,
4914,CANTO XXXII,CANTO XXXII
4915,CANTO XXXII,
4916,CANTO XXXII,
4917,CANTO XXXII,"Mine eyes with such an eager coveting,"
4918,CANTO XXXII,"Were bent to rid them of their ten years’ thirst,"
4919,CANTO XXXII,No other sense was waking: and e’en they
4920,CANTO XXXII,Were fenc’d on either side from heed of aught;
4921,CANTO XXXII,So tangled in its custom’d toils that smile
4922,CANTO XXXII,"Of saintly brightness drew me to itself,"
4923,CANTO XXXII,When forcibly toward the left my sight
4924,CANTO XXXII,The sacred virgins turn’d; for from their lips
4925,CANTO XXXII,I heard the warning sounds: “Too fix’d a gaze!”
4926,CANTO XXXII,
4927,CANTO XXXII,Awhile my vision labor’d; as when late
4928,CANTO XXXII,Upon the’ o’erstrained eyes the sun hath smote:
4929,CANTO XXXII,"But soon to lesser object, as the view"
4930,CANTO XXXII,Was now recover’d (lesser in respect
4931,CANTO XXXII,"To that excess of sensible, whence late"
4932,CANTO XXXII,I had perforce been sunder’d) on their right
4933,CANTO XXXII,"I mark’d that glorious army wheel, and turn,"
4934,CANTO XXXII,"Against the sun and sev’nfold lights, their front."
4935,CANTO XXXII,"As when, their bucklers for protection rais’d,"
4936,CANTO XXXII,"A well-rang’d troop, with portly banners curl’d,"
4937,CANTO XXXII,"Wheel circling, ere the whole can change their ground:"
4938,CANTO XXXII,E’en thus the goodly regiment of heav’n
4939,CANTO XXXII,"Proceeding, all did pass us, ere the car"
4940,CANTO XXXII,Had slop’d his beam. Attendant at the wheels
4941,CANTO XXXII,The damsels turn’d; and on the Gryphon mov’d
4942,CANTO XXXII,"The sacred burden, with a pace so smooth,"
4943,CANTO XXXII,No feather on him trembled. The fair dame
4944,CANTO XXXII,"Who through the wave had drawn me, companied"
4945,CANTO XXXII,"By Statius and myself, pursued the wheel,"
4946,CANTO XXXII,"Whose orbit, rolling, mark’d a lesser arch."
4947,CANTO XXXII,
4948,CANTO XXXII,"Through the high wood, now void (the more her blame,"
4949,CANTO XXXII,Who by the serpent was beguil’d) I past
4950,CANTO XXXII,With step in cadence to the harmony
4951,CANTO XXXII,"Angelic. Onward had we mov’d, as far"
4952,CANTO XXXII,Perchance as arrow at three several flights
4953,CANTO XXXII,"Full wing’d had sped, when from her station down"
4954,CANTO XXXII,Descended Beatrice. With one voice
4955,CANTO XXXII,"All murmur’d “Adam,” circling next a plant"
4956,CANTO XXXII,Despoil’d of flowers and leaf on every bough.
4957,CANTO XXXII,"Its tresses, spreading more as more they rose,"
4958,CANTO XXXII,"Were such, as ’midst their forest wilds for height"
4959,CANTO XXXII,The Indians might have gaz’d at. “Blessed thou!
4960,CANTO XXXII,"Gryphon, whose beak hath never pluck’d that tree"
4961,CANTO XXXII,Pleasant to taste: for hence the appetite
4962,CANTO XXXII,Was warp’d to evil.” Round the stately trunk
4963,CANTO XXXII,"Thus shouted forth the rest, to whom return’d"
4964,CANTO XXXII,The animal twice-gender’d: “Yea: for so
4965,CANTO XXXII,The generation of the just are sav’d.”
4966,CANTO XXXII,"And turning to the chariot-pole, to foot"
4967,CANTO XXXII,"He drew it of the widow’d branch, and bound"
4968,CANTO XXXII,There left unto the stock whereon it grew.
4969,CANTO XXXII,
4970,CANTO XXXII,As when large floods of radiance from above
4971,CANTO XXXII,"Stream, with that radiance mingled, which ascends"
4972,CANTO XXXII,"Next after setting of the scaly sign,"
4973,CANTO XXXII,"Our plants then burgeon, and each wears anew"
4974,CANTO XXXII,"His wonted colours, ere the sun have yok’d"
4975,CANTO XXXII,Beneath another star his flamy steeds;
4976,CANTO XXXII,"Thus putting forth a hue, more faint than rose,"
4977,CANTO XXXII,"And deeper than the violet, was renew’d"
4978,CANTO XXXII,"The plant, erewhile in all its branches bare."
4979,CANTO XXXII,
4980,CANTO XXXII,"Unearthly was the hymn, which then arose."
4981,CANTO XXXII,"I understood it not, nor to the end"
4982,CANTO XXXII,Endur’d the harmony. Had I the skill
4983,CANTO XXXII,"To pencil forth, how clos’d th’ unpitying eyes"
4984,CANTO XXXII,"Slumb’ring, when Syrinx warbled, (eyes that paid"
4985,CANTO XXXII,"So dearly for their watching,) then like painter,"
4986,CANTO XXXII,"That with a model paints, I might design"
4987,CANTO XXXII,The manner of my falling into sleep.
4988,CANTO XXXII,But feign who will the slumber cunningly;
4989,CANTO XXXII,"I pass it by to when I wak’d, and tell"
4990,CANTO XXXII,How suddenly a flash of splendour rent
4991,CANTO XXXII,"The curtain of my sleep, and one cries out:"
4992,CANTO XXXII,"“Arise, what dost thou?” As the chosen three,"
4993,CANTO XXXII,"On Tabor’s mount, admitted to behold"
4994,CANTO XXXII,"The blossoming of that fair tree, whose fruit"
4995,CANTO XXXII,"Is coveted of angels, and doth make"
4996,CANTO XXXII,"Perpetual feast in heaven, to themselves"
4997,CANTO XXXII,"Returning at the word, whence deeper sleeps"
4998,CANTO XXXII,"Were broken, that they their tribe diminish’d saw,"
4999,CANTO XXXII,"Both Moses and Elias gone, and chang’d"
5000,CANTO XXXII,The stole their master wore: thus to myself
5001,CANTO XXXII,"Returning, over me beheld I stand"
5002,CANTO XXXII,"The piteous one, who cross the stream had brought"
5003,CANTO XXXII,"My steps. “And where,” all doubting, I exclaim’d,"
5004,CANTO XXXII,"“Is Beatrice?”—“See her,” she replied,"
5005,CANTO XXXII,“Beneath the fresh leaf seated on its root.
5006,CANTO XXXII,Behold th’ associate choir that circles her.
5007,CANTO XXXII,"The others, with a melody more sweet"
5008,CANTO XXXII,"And more profound, journeying to higher realms,"
5009,CANTO XXXII,Upon the Gryphon tend.” If there her words
5010,CANTO XXXII,"Were clos’d, I know not; but mine eyes had now"
5011,CANTO XXXII,"Ta’en view of her, by whom all other thoughts"
5012,CANTO XXXII,Were barr’d admittance. On the very ground
5013,CANTO XXXII,"Alone she sat, as she had there been left"
5014,CANTO XXXII,"A guard upon the wain, which I beheld"
5015,CANTO XXXII,Bound to the twyform beast. The seven nymphs
5016,CANTO XXXII,"Did make themselves a cloister round about her,"
5017,CANTO XXXII,And in their hands upheld those lights secure
5018,CANTO XXXII,From blast septentrion and the gusty south.
5019,CANTO XXXII,
5020,CANTO XXXII,“A little while thou shalt be forester here:
5021,CANTO XXXII,"And citizen shalt be forever with me,"
5022,CANTO XXXII,"Of that true Rome, wherein Christ dwells a Roman"
5023,CANTO XXXII,"To profit the misguided world, keep now"
5024,CANTO XXXII,"Thine eyes upon the car; and what thou seest,"
5025,CANTO XXXII,"Take heed thou write, returning to that place.”"
5026,CANTO XXXII,
5027,CANTO XXXII,Thus Beatrice: at whose feet inclin’d
5028,CANTO XXXII,"Devout, at her behest, my thought and eyes,"
5029,CANTO XXXII,"I, as she bade, directed. Never fire,"
5030,CANTO XXXII,"With so swift motion, forth a stormy cloud"
5031,CANTO XXXII,"Leap’d downward from the welkin’s farthest bound,"
5032,CANTO XXXII,As I beheld the bird of Jove descending
5033,CANTO XXXII,"Pounce on the tree, and, as he rush’d, the rind,"
5034,CANTO XXXII,"Disparting crush beneath him, buds much more"
5035,CANTO XXXII,And leaflets. On the car with all his might
5036,CANTO XXXII,"He struck, whence, staggering like a ship, it reel’d,"
5037,CANTO XXXII,"At random driv’n, to starboard now, o’ercome,"
5038,CANTO XXXII,"And now to larboard, by the vaulting waves."
5039,CANTO XXXII,
5040,CANTO XXXII,Next springing up into the chariot’s womb
5041,CANTO XXXII,"A fox I saw, with hunger seeming pin’d"
5042,CANTO XXXII,"Of all good food. But, for his ugly sins"
5043,CANTO XXXII,"The saintly maid rebuking him, away"
5044,CANTO XXXII,"Scamp’ring he turn’d, fast as his hide-bound corpse"
5045,CANTO XXXII,"Would bear him. Next, from whence before he came,"
5046,CANTO XXXII,I saw the eagle dart into the hull
5047,CANTO XXXII,"O’ th’ car, and leave it with his feathers lin’d;"
5048,CANTO XXXII,"And then a voice, like that which issues forth"
5049,CANTO XXXII,"From heart with sorrow riv’d, did issue forth"
5050,CANTO XXXII,"From heav’n, and, “O poor bark of mine!” it cried,"
5051,CANTO XXXII,"“How badly art thou freighted!” Then, it seem’d,"
5052,CANTO XXXII,"That the earth open’d between either wheel,"
5053,CANTO XXXII,"And I beheld a dragon issue thence,"
5054,CANTO XXXII,That through the chariot fix’d his forked train;
5055,CANTO XXXII,"And like a wasp that draggeth back the sting,"
5056,CANTO XXXII,"So drawing forth his baleful train, he dragg’d"
5057,CANTO XXXII,"Part of the bottom forth, and went his way"
5058,CANTO XXXII,"Exulting. What remain’d, as lively turf"
5059,CANTO XXXII,"With green herb, so did clothe itself with plumes,"
5060,CANTO XXXII,Which haply had with purpose chaste and kind
5061,CANTO XXXII,"Been offer’d; and therewith were cloth’d the wheels,"
5062,CANTO XXXII,"Both one and other, and the beam, so quickly"
5063,CANTO XXXII,"A sigh were not breath’d sooner. Thus transform’d,"
5064,CANTO XXXII,"The holy structure, through its several parts,"
5065,CANTO XXXII,"Did put forth heads, three on the beam, and one"
5066,CANTO XXXII,"On every side; the first like oxen horn’d,"
5067,CANTO XXXII,But with a single horn upon their front
5068,CANTO XXXII,The four. Like monster sight hath never seen.
5069,CANTO XXXII,"O’er it methought there sat, secure as rock"
5070,CANTO XXXII,"On mountain’s lofty top, a shameless whore,"
5071,CANTO XXXII,"Whose ken rov’d loosely round her. At her side,"
5072,CANTO XXXII,"As ’t were that none might bear her off, I saw"
5073,CANTO XXXII,"A giant stand; and ever, and anon"
5074,CANTO XXXII,"They mingled kisses. But, her lustful eyes"
5075,CANTO XXXII,"Chancing on me to wander, that fell minion"
5076,CANTO XXXII,Scourg’d her from head to foot all o’er; then full
5077,CANTO XXXII,"Of jealousy, and fierce with rage, unloos’d"
5078,CANTO XXXII,"The monster, and dragg’d on, so far across"
5079,CANTO XXXII,"The forest, that from me its shades alone"
5080,CANTO XXXII,Shielded the harlot and the new-form’d brute.
5081,CANTO XXXII,
5082,CANTO XXXII,
5083,CANTO XXXII,
5084,CANTO XXXII,
5085,CANTO XXXIII,CANTO XXXIII
5086,CANTO XXXIII,
5087,CANTO XXXIII,
5088,CANTO XXXIII,"“The heathen, Lord! are come!” responsive thus,"
5089,CANTO XXXIII,"The trinal now, and now the virgin band"
5090,CANTO XXXIII,"Quaternion, their sweet psalmody began,"
5091,CANTO XXXIII,"Weeping; and Beatrice listen’d, sad"
5092,CANTO XXXIII,"And sighing, to the song’, in such a mood,"
5093,CANTO XXXIII,"That Mary, as she stood beside the cross,"
5094,CANTO XXXIII,Was scarce more chang’d. But when they gave her place
5095,CANTO XXXIII,"To speak, then, risen upright on her feet,"
5096,CANTO XXXIII,"She, with a colour glowing bright as fire,"
5097,CANTO XXXIII,"Did answer: “Yet a little while, and ye"
5098,CANTO XXXIII,"Shall see me not; and, my beloved sisters,"
5099,CANTO XXXIII,"Again a little while, and ye shall see me.”"
5100,CANTO XXXIII,
5101,CANTO XXXIII,"Before her then she marshall’d all the seven,"
5102,CANTO XXXIII,"And, beck’ning only motion’d me, the dame,"
5103,CANTO XXXIII,"And that remaining sage, to follow her."
5104,CANTO XXXIII,
5105,CANTO XXXIII,"So on she pass’d; and had not set, I ween,"
5106,CANTO XXXIII,"Her tenth step to the ground, when with mine eyes"
5107,CANTO XXXIII,"Her eyes encounter’d; and, with visage mild,"
5108,CANTO XXXIII,"“So mend thy pace,” she cried, “that if my words"
5109,CANTO XXXIII,"Address thee, thou mayst still be aptly plac’d"
5110,CANTO XXXIII,To hear them.” Soon as duly to her side
5111,CANTO XXXIII,"I now had hasten’d: “Brother!” she began,"
5112,CANTO XXXIII,"“Why mak’st thou no attempt at questioning,"
5113,CANTO XXXIII,As thus we walk together?” Like to those
5114,CANTO XXXIII,"Who, speaking with too reverent an awe"
5115,CANTO XXXIII,"Before their betters, draw not forth the voice"
5116,CANTO XXXIII,"Alive unto their lips, befell me shell"
5117,CANTO XXXIII,That I in sounds imperfect thus began:
5118,CANTO XXXIII,"“Lady! what I have need of, that thou know’st,"
5119,CANTO XXXIII,And what will suit my need.” She answering thus:
5120,CANTO XXXIII,"“Of fearfulness and shame, I will, that thou"
5121,CANTO XXXIII,"Henceforth do rid thee: that thou speak no more,"
5122,CANTO XXXIII,As one who dreams. Thus far be taught of me:
5123,CANTO XXXIII,"The vessel, which thou saw’st the serpent break,"
5124,CANTO XXXIII,"Was and is not: let him, who hath the blame,"
5125,CANTO XXXIII,Hope not to scare God’s vengeance with a sop.
5126,CANTO XXXIII,Without an heir for ever shall not be
5127,CANTO XXXIII,"That eagle, he, who left the chariot plum’d,"
5128,CANTO XXXIII,Which monster made it first and next a prey.
5129,CANTO XXXIII,"Plainly I view, and therefore speak, the stars"
5130,CANTO XXXIII,"E’en now approaching, whose conjunction, free"
5131,CANTO XXXIII,"From all impediment and bar, brings on"
5132,CANTO XXXIII,"A season, in the which, one sent from God,"
5133,CANTO XXXIII,"(Five hundred, five, and ten, do mark him out)"
5134,CANTO XXXIII,"That foul one, and th’ accomplice of her guilt,"
5135,CANTO XXXIII,"The giant, both shall slay. And if perchance"
5136,CANTO XXXIII,"My saying, dark as Themis or as Sphinx,"
5137,CANTO XXXIII,"Fail to persuade thee, (since like them it foils"
5138,CANTO XXXIII,The intellect with blindness) yet ere long
5139,CANTO XXXIII,"Events shall be the Naiads, that will solve"
5140,CANTO XXXIII,"This knotty riddle, and no damage light"
5141,CANTO XXXIII,On flock or field. Take heed; and as these words
5142,CANTO XXXIII,"By me are utter’d, teach them even so"
5143,CANTO XXXIII,"To those who live that life, which is a race"
5144,CANTO XXXIII,"To death: and when thou writ’st them, keep in mind"
5145,CANTO XXXIII,"Not to conceal how thou hast seen the plant,"
5146,CANTO XXXIII,"That twice hath now been spoil’d. This whoso robs,"
5147,CANTO XXXIII,"This whoso plucks, with blasphemy of deed"
5148,CANTO XXXIII,"Sins against God, who for his use alone"
5149,CANTO XXXIII,"Creating hallow’d it. For taste of this,"
5150,CANTO XXXIII,"In pain and in desire, five thousand years"
5151,CANTO XXXIII,"And upward, the first soul did yearn for him,"
5152,CANTO XXXIII,Who punish’d in himself the fatal gust.
5153,CANTO XXXIII,
5154,CANTO XXXIII,"“Thy reason slumbers, if it deem this height"
5155,CANTO XXXIII,"And summit thus inverted of the plant,"
5156,CANTO XXXIII,"Without due cause: and were not vainer thoughts,"
5157,CANTO XXXIII,"As Elsa’s numbing waters, to thy soul,"
5158,CANTO XXXIII,And their fond pleasures had not dyed it dark
5159,CANTO XXXIII,"As Pyramus the mulberry, thou hadst seen,"
5160,CANTO XXXIII,"In such momentous circumstance alone,"
5161,CANTO XXXIII,God’s equal justice morally implied
5162,CANTO XXXIII,In the forbidden tree. But since I mark thee
5163,CANTO XXXIII,"In understanding harden’d into stone,"
5164,CANTO XXXIII,"And, to that hardness, spotted too and stain’d,"
5165,CANTO XXXIII,"So that thine eye is dazzled at my word,"
5166,CANTO XXXIII,"I will, that, if not written, yet at least"
5167,CANTO XXXIII,"Painted thou take it in thee, for the cause,"
5168,CANTO XXXIII,That one brings home his staff inwreath’d with palm.
5169,CANTO XXXIII,
5170,CANTO XXXIII,"I thus: “As wax by seal, that changeth not"
5171,CANTO XXXIII,"Its impress, now is stamp’d my brain by thee."
5172,CANTO XXXIII,But wherefore soars thy wish’d-for speech so high
5173,CANTO XXXIII,"Beyond my sight, that loses it the more,"
5174,CANTO XXXIII,The more it strains to reach it?”—“To the end
5175,CANTO XXXIII,"That thou mayst know,” she answer’d straight, “the school,"
5176,CANTO XXXIII,"That thou hast follow’d; and how far behind,"
5177,CANTO XXXIII,"When following my discourse, its learning halts:"
5178,CANTO XXXIII,"And mayst behold your art, from the divine"
5179,CANTO XXXIII,"As distant, as the disagreement is"
5180,CANTO XXXIII,’Twixt earth and heaven’s most high and rapturous orb.”
5181,CANTO XXXIII,
5182,CANTO XXXIII,"“I not remember,” I replied, “that e’er"
5183,CANTO XXXIII,"I was estrang’d from thee, nor for such fault"
5184,CANTO XXXIII,Doth conscience chide me.” Smiling she return’d:
5185,CANTO XXXIII,"“If thou canst, not remember, call to mind"
5186,CANTO XXXIII,How lately thou hast drunk of Lethe’s wave;
5187,CANTO XXXIII,"And, sure as smoke doth indicate a flame,"
5188,CANTO XXXIII,In that forgetfulness itself conclude
5189,CANTO XXXIII,Blame from thy alienated will incurr’d.
5190,CANTO XXXIII,From henceforth verily my words shall be
5191,CANTO XXXIII,As naked as will suit them to appear
5192,CANTO XXXIII,"In thy unpractis’d view.” More sparkling now,"
5193,CANTO XXXIII,And with retarded course the sun possess’d
5194,CANTO XXXIII,"The circle of mid-day, that varies still"
5195,CANTO XXXIII,"As th’ aspect varies of each several clime,"
5196,CANTO XXXIII,"When, as one, sent in vaward of a troop"
5197,CANTO XXXIII,"For escort, pauses, if perchance he spy"
5198,CANTO XXXIII,Vestige of somewhat strange and rare: so paus’d
5199,CANTO XXXIII,"The sev’nfold band, arriving at the verge"
5200,CANTO XXXIII,"Of a dun umbrage hoar, such as is seen,"
5201,CANTO XXXIII,"Beneath green leaves and gloomy branches, oft"
5202,CANTO XXXIII,To overbrow a bleak and alpine cliff.
5203,CANTO XXXIII,"And, where they stood, before them, as it seem’d,"
5204,CANTO XXXIII,"Tigris and Euphrates both beheld,"
5205,CANTO XXXIII,"Forth from one fountain issue; and, like friends,"
5206,CANTO XXXIII,Linger at parting. “O enlight’ning beam!
5207,CANTO XXXIII,O glory of our kind! beseech thee say
5208,CANTO XXXIII,"What water this, which from one source deriv’d"
5209,CANTO XXXIII,Itself removes to distance from itself?”
5210,CANTO XXXIII,
5211,CANTO XXXIII,To such entreaty answer thus was made:
5212,CANTO XXXIII,"“Entreat Matilda, that she teach thee this.”"
5213,CANTO XXXIII,
5214,CANTO XXXIII,"And here, as one, who clears himself of blame"
5215,CANTO XXXIII,"Imputed, the fair dame return’d: “Of me"
5216,CANTO XXXIII,He this and more hath learnt; and I am safe
5217,CANTO XXXIII,That Lethe’s water hath not hid it from him.”
5218,CANTO XXXIII,
5219,CANTO XXXIII,And Beatrice: “Some more pressing care
5220,CANTO XXXIII,"That oft the memory ’reeves, perchance hath made"
5221,CANTO XXXIII,His mind’s eye dark. But lo! where Eunoe cows!
5222,CANTO XXXIII,"Lead thither; and, as thou art wont, revive"
5223,CANTO XXXIII,"His fainting virtue.” As a courteous spirit,"
5224,CANTO XXXIII,"That proffers no excuses, but as soon"
5225,CANTO XXXIII,"As he hath token of another’s will,"
5226,CANTO XXXIII,"Makes it his own; when she had ta’en me, thus"
5227,CANTO XXXIII,"The lovely maiden mov’d her on, and call’d"
5228,CANTO XXXIII,To Statius with an air most lady-like:
5229,CANTO XXXIII,"“Come thou with him.” Were further space allow’d,"
5230,CANTO XXXIII,"Then, Reader, might I sing, though but in part,"
5231,CANTO XXXIII,"That beverage, with whose sweetness I had ne’er"
5232,CANTO XXXIII,"Been sated. But, since all the leaves are full,"
5233,CANTO XXXIII,"Appointed for this second strain, mine art"
5234,CANTO XXXIII,With warning bridle checks me. I return’d
5235,CANTO XXXIII,"From the most holy wave, regenerate,"
5236,CANTO XXXIII,"If ’en as new plants renew’d with foliage new,"
5237,CANTO XXXIII,Pure and made apt for mounting to the stars.
