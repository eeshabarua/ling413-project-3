73,ADVERTISEMENT.,"Since the Sections which relate to Ethnology passed through the Press,"
74,ADVERTISEMENT.,the First Volume of Mr. Rawlinson’s Herodotus has appeared. Earlier
75,ADVERTISEMENT.,possession of this important Publication would have emboldened me
76,ADVERTISEMENT.,to proceed a step further in the attempt to specify the probable or
77,ADVERTISEMENT.,possible form of the original Ethnic relation between the Pelasgians
78,ADVERTISEMENT.,"and the Hellenes of the Greek Peninsula, but designating the latter"
79,ADVERTISEMENT.,"as pure Arian, and the former as Arian, with a residue or mixture of"
80,ADVERTISEMENT.,Turanian elements.
81,ADVERTISEMENT.,
82,ADVERTISEMENT.,"It has also been since the ‘Olympus’ was printed, that I have become"
83,ADVERTISEMENT.,acquainted with Welcker’s recent and unfinished ‘_Griechische
84,ADVERTISEMENT.,"Götterlehre_,’ (Göttingen, 1857.) I could have wished to refer to it"
85,ADVERTISEMENT.,"at various points, and especially to avail myself of the clearer view,"
86,ADVERTISEMENT.,"which the learned Author has given, of the position of Κρόνος."
87,ADVERTISEMENT.,
88,ADVERTISEMENT.,Founding himself in part on the exclusive appropriation by Homer of the
89,ADVERTISEMENT.,"term Κρονίδης to Jupiter, he enables us to see how Jupiter may have"
90,ADVERTISEMENT.,inherited the sole use of the title as being ‘the Ancient of days;’
91,ADVERTISEMENT.,and how Κρόνος was a formation in the Mythology wholly secondary and
92,ADVERTISEMENT.,"posterior to his reputed son. (Welcker, sectt. 27, 8. pp. 140-7.)"
93,ADVERTISEMENT.,
94,ADVERTISEMENT.,"Another recent book, M. Alfred Maury’s _Histoire des Religions de la"
95,ADVERTISEMENT.,"Grèce Antique_, undertakes the useful task of unfolding largely the"
96,ADVERTISEMENT.,relations of the Greek religion to the East. But the division of it
97,ADVERTISEMENT.,"which deals with Homer specifically is neither complete nor accurate,"
98,ADVERTISEMENT.,and affords a new illustration of the proposition which I chiefly
99,ADVERTISEMENT.,"desire to establish, namely, that Homer ought to be treated as a"
100,ADVERTISEMENT.,separate and independent centre of study.

582,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"political models: that, if we adjust our sympathies and antipathies"

584,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"in Rome, Athens, or Sparta, they will not be cast in an English mould,"

589,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,general they present to us a state of political ideas and morals
590,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,greatly deranged: the choice lies between evil on this side in one

594,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"so to speak, of anatomical models in our hands, to lay aside the idea"
595,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,of attaching our sympathies to what we see. I would rather incite the
596,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,objector to examine and judge whether we may not find an admirable

613,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"unintentionally, by Grote, where, throwing Homer as he does into"
614,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"hotch-pot, so to speak, with the ‘legendary age,’ he expresses"
615,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"himself in his Preface[1], as follows. ‘It must be confessed that"
616,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the sentimental attributes of the Greek mind--its religious and
617,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"poetical vein--here appear in disproportionate relief, as compared"
618,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,with its more vigorous and masculine capacities--with those powers of
619,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"acting, organizing, judging, and speculating, which will be revealed"
620,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,in the forthcoming volumes.’ If the sentimental attribute is to be
621,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"contra-distinguished from the powers, I will not say of speculating,"
622,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"but of acting, organizing, and judging, then I know of nothing less"
623,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,sentimental in the after-history of Greece than the characters of
624,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Achilles and Ulysses, than the relations of the Greek chiefs to one"
625,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"another and to their people, than the strength and simplicity which"
626,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,laid in those early times the foundation-stones of the Greek national
627,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"character and institutions, and made them in the social order the"
628,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,just counterparts of the material structures that are now ascribed
629,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"to the Pelasgians; simple indeed in their elements, but so durable"
630,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and massive in their combination, as to be the marvel of all time."
631,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,The influences derived from these sources were of such vitality and
632,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"depth, that they secured to an insignificant country a predominating"
633,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"power for centuries, made one little point of the West an effective"
634,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"bulwark against the East, and caused Greece to throw out, to the right"
635,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and left, so many branches each greater than the trunk. Even when the"
636,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"sun of her glory had set, there was yet left behind an immortal spark"
637,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of the ancient vitality, which, enduring through all vicissitudes,"
638,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,kindled into a blaze after two thousand years; and we of this day
639,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"have seen a Greek nation, founded anew by its own energies, become"
640,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,a centre of desire and hope at least to Eastern Christendom. The
641,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,English are not ashamed to own their political forefathers in the
642,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,forests of the Northward European Continent; and the later statesmen
643,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"with the lawgivers of Greece were in their day glad, and with reason"
644,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"glad, to trace the bold outline and solid rudiments of their own and"
645,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,their country’s greatness in the poems of Homer. Nothing in those
646,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"poems offers itself, to me at least, as more remarkable, than the"
647,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"deep carving of the political characters; and what is still more, the"
648,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,intense political spirit which pervades them. I will venture one step

650,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,there is no one of which the inhabitants ought to find that spirit so
651,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"intelligible and accessible as the English: because it is a spirit,"
652,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"that still largely lives and breathes in our own institutions, and, if"
653,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"I mistake not, even in the peculiarities of those institutions. There"
654,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"we find the great cardinal ideas, which lie at the very foundation of"
655,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"all enlightened government: and then we find, too, the men formed under"

694,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"The Greek States of the historic ages, says Grote, always present"
695,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"to us something in the nature of a constitution, as the condition"
696,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of popular respect towards the government, and of the sense of an"
697,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"obligation to obey it[4]. The man who broke down this constitution,"
698,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"however wisely he might exercise his ill gotten power, was branded by"
699,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the name of τύραννος, or despot, “as an object of mingled fear and"
700,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"dislike.” But in the heroic age there is no system, still less any"
701,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,responsibility[5]: obedience depends on personal reverence towards the
702,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"king or chief. Into those ‘great individual personalities, the race"
703,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"or nation is absorbed[6].’ Publicity indeed, through the means of the"
704,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"council and assembly, essentially pervades the whole system[7]; but it"
705,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"is a publicity without consequences; for the people, when they have"
706,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"heard, simply obey the orders of the king[8]. Either resistance or"
707,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"criticism is generally exhibited as odious, and is never heard of at"
708,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,all except from those who are at the least subaltern chiefs: though
709,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the council and assembly would in practice come to be restraints
710,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"upon the king, they are not so exhibited in Homer[9], but are simple"

712,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"resolves[10]. The people may listen and sympathize, but no more. In the"

714,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,of ‘the degradation of the mass of the people before the chiefs[11].’
715,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"For because the common soldiery, in conformity with the ‘unaccountable"

717,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,belabours them with blows and covers them with scornful reproofs[12];
718,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and the unpopularity of a presumptuous critic, even when he is in"

768,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"But that which is beyond every thing distinctive not of Greece only,"
769,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"but of Homeric Greece, is, that along with an outline of sovereignty"
770,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and public institutions highly patriarchal, we find the full, constant,"

773,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,and persuasion. I name these two great features of the politics and
774,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"institutions of the heroic age, in order to concentrate upon them"
775,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the marked attention which I think they deserve. And I venture to
776,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"give to this paper the name of the Ἀγορὴ, because it was the Greek"
777,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Assembly of those days, which mainly imparted to the existing polities"
778,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"their specific spirit as well as features. Amid undeveloped ideas,"
779,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"rude methods, imperfect organization, and liability to the frequent"
780,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"intrusion of the strong hand, there lies in them the essence of a"
781,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"popular principle of government, which cannot, I believe, plead on its"

784,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"As is the boy, so is the man. As is the seed, so is the plant. The dove"
785,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"neither begets, nor yet grows into the eagle. How came it that the"
786,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,prime philosophers of full-grown Greece gave to the science of Politics
787,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the very highest place in the scale of human knowledge? That they,"
788,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"kings in the region of abstract thought, for the first and perhaps the"
789,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"only time in the history of the world, came to think they discerned in"
790,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the turbid eddies of state affairs the image of the noblest thing for
791,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"man, the noblest that speculation as well as action could provide for"
792,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"him? Aristotle says that, of all sciences, Πολιτικὴ is ἡ κυριωτάτη καὶ"
793,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,μάλιστα ἀρχιτεκτονική[14]; and that ethical science constitutes but
794,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"a branch of it, πολιτική τις οὖσα. Whence, I ask, did this Greek idea"
795,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"come? It is not the Greece, but it is the Rome of history, which the"
796,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,judgment and experience of the world has taken as its great teacher in
797,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the mere business of law and political organization. For so lofty a
798,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,theory (a theory without doubt exaggerated) from so practical a person
799,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"as Aristotle, we must assume a corresponding elevation of source. I"
800,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,cannot help believing that the source is to be found rather in the
801,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"infancy, than in the maturity, of Greek society. As I read Homer, the"
802,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,real first foundations of political science were laid in the heroic
803,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"age, with a depth and breadth exceeding in their proportions any"
804,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"fabric, however imposing, that the after-time of Greece was able to"
805,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,rear upon them. That after-time was in truth infected with a spirit of

817,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,~_Functions of the King._~
818,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
819,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Let us begin with the King; who constituted at once the highest class
820,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"in society, and the centre of its institutions."
821,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
822,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"The political regimen of Greece, at the period immediately preceding"
823,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the Trojan war, appears to have been that described by Thucydides,"
824,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"when he says that the tyrannies, which had come in with the increase"
825,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of wealth, were preceded by hereditary monarchies with limited"
826,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,prerogatives[15]: πρότερον δὲ ἦσαν ἐπὶ ῥητοῖς γέρασι πατρικαὶ
827,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,βασιλεῖαι. And again by Aristotle; βασιλεία ... ἡ περὶ τοὺς ἡρωικοὺς
828,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"χρόνους ... ἦν ἑκόντων μὲν, ἐπὶ τισὶ δὲ ὡρισμένοις· στρατηγὸς γὰρ ἦν"
829,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"καὶ δικαστὴς ὁ βασιλεὺς, καὶ τῶν περὶ τοὺς θεοὺς κύριος. The threefold"
830,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"function of the King was to command the army, to administer justice"
831,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"chiefly, though not exclusively, between man and man, and to conduct"
832,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the rites of religion[16].

837,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
838,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Independently of sovereignties purely local, we find in Homer traces"
839,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of a maritime Cretan empire, which had recently passed away: and we"
840,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"find a subsisting Pelopid empire, which appears to have been the first"
841,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of its kind, at least on the Greek mainland. For the Pelopid sceptre"
842,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,was not one taken over from the Perseids: it was obtained through
843,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Mercury, that is, probably through contrivance, from Jupiter: and the"
844,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,difference probably consisted in one or both of these two particulars.
845,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"It comprehended the whole range of continental Greece, πᾶν Ἄργος, to"
846,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"which are added, either at once or in its progressive extension, the"
847,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"πολλαὶ νῆσοι (Il. ii. 108) of the Minoan empire. Besides this, it"
848,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"consisted of a double sovereignty: one, a suzerainty or supremacy over"
849,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"a number of chiefs, each of whom conducted the ordinary government of"
850,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"his own dominions; the other, a direct, though perhaps not always an"
851,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"effective control, not only over an hereditary territory, but over"
852,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the unclaimed residue of minor settlements and principalities in the
853,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"country. This inference may, I think, be gathered from the fact that"
854,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,we find the force of Agamemnon before Troy drawn exclusively from his
855,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Mycenian dominions, while he had claims of tribute from towns in the"
856,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"south-west of Peloponnesus, which lay at some distance from his centre"
857,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of power, and which apparently furnished no aid in the war of Troy."
858,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
859,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,The Pheræ of Diocles lay on the way from Pylos to Sparta: and Pheræ
860,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"is one of the towns which Agamemnon promised to Achilles. It should,"
861,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"however, be borne in mind that, as the family of names to which Pheræ"
862,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"belonged was one so largely dispersed, we must not positively assume"
863,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the identity of the two towns.
864,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
865,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,~_Degrees in Kingship and in Lordship._~
866,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
867,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Kingship in Homer is susceptible of degree; it is one thing for the
868,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"local sovereignties, such as those of Nestor or Ulysses, and another"
869,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"for the great supremacy of Agamemnon, which overrode them. Still the"
870,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Greek βασιλῆες in the Iliad constitute a class by themselves; a class
871,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"that comprises the greater leaders and warriors, who immediately"
872,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"surround Agamemnon, the head of the army."
873,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
874,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Of by much the greater part even of chiefs and leaders of contingents,"
875,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,it is plain from the poem that though they were lords (ἄνακτες) of a
876,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"certain tribe or territory, they were not βασιλῆες or kings."
877,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
878,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,These chiefs and lords again divide themselves into two classes: one
879,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"is composed of those who had immediate local heads, such as Phœnix,"
880,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"lord of the Dolopes, under Peleus at Phthia, probably Sthenelus under"
881,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Diomed, and perhaps also Meriones under Idomeneus: the other is the"
882,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"class of chieftains, to which order the great majority belong, owning"
883,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"no subordination to any prince except to Agamemnon. Among these, again,"
884,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,there is probably a distinction between those sub-chiefs who owned him
885,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"as a local sovereign, and those who were only subject to him as the"
886,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,head of the great Greek confederation.
887,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
888,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,It is probable that the subordination of the sub-chief to his local
889,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,sovereign was a closer tie than that of the local sovereign to the head
890,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of Greece. For, according to the evidence supplied by the promises of"
891,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Agamemnon to Achilles[17], tribute was payable by the lords of towns"
892,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"to their immediate political superior: not a tribute in coined money,"
893,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"which did not exist, nor one fixed in quantity; but a benevolence"
894,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"(δωτίνη), which must have consisted in commodities. Metals, including"
895,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the precious metals, would, however, very commonly be the medium of"
896,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"acquittance. Again, we find these sub-chiefs invested with dominion by"
897,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the local sovereign, residing at his court, holding a subaltern command"
898,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,in his army. All these points are combined in the case of Phœnix. On
899,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the other hand, as to positive duty or service, we know of none that"
900,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"a sovereign like Nestor owed to Agamemnon, except it were to take a"
901,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,part in enterprises of national concern under his guidance. But the
902,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,distinction of rank between them is clear. Evidently on account of
903,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"his relation to Agamemnon, Menelaus is βασιλεύτερος, higher in mere"
904,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"kingship, or more a king, than the other chiefs: Agamemnon boasts[18]"
905,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"that he is greatly the superior of Achilles, or of any one else in the"
906,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"army; and in the Ninth Book Achilles seems to refer with stinging, nay,"
907,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"rather with slaying irony, to this claim of greater kingliness for"
908,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the Pelopids, when he rejects the offer of the hand of any one among"
909,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Agamemnon’s daughters; No! let him choose another son-in-law, who may"
910,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"be worthy of him, and who is more a king than I[19];"

921,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of the whole body of Βασιλῆες is, on the whole, well and clearly marked"
922,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"off, by the consistent language of the Iliad, from all inferior ranks:"
923,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,and this combination may remind us in some degree of the British

925,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"is founded essentially upon parity, and is sharply severed from all"
926,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the other orders of the community. We shall presently see how this
927,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,proposition is made good.
928,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
929,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"It thus far appears, that we find substantially, though not very"
930,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"determinately, distinguished, the following forms of larger and lesser"
931,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Greek sovereignty:
932,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
933,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"I. That held by Agamemnon, as the head of Greece."
934,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
935,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"II. The local kings, some of them considerable enough to have other"
936,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,lords or princes (ἄνακτες) under them.
937,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
938,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"III. The minor chiefs of contingents; who, though not kings, were"
939,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"princes or lords (ἄνακτες), and governed separate states of their own:"
940,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"such as Thoas for Ætolia, and Menestheus for Athens."
941,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
942,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"IV. The petty and scattered chiefs, of whom we can hardly tell how far"
943,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"any account is taken in the Catalogue, but who belonged, in some sense,"
944,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"to Agamemnon, by belonging to no one else."
945,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
946,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,~_First tokens of change in the Heroic Polities._~
947,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
948,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"There are signs, contained in the Iliad itself, that the primitive"
949,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"monarchies, the nature and spirit of which will presently be examined,"
950,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,were beginning to give way even at the time of the expedition to Troy.
951,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,The growth of the Pelopid empire was probably unfavourable to their
952,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"continuance. In any case, the notes of commencing change will be found"
953,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,clear enough.
954,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
955,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Minos had ruled over all Crete as king; but Idomeneus, his grandson,"
956,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"is nowhere mentioned as the king of that country, of which he appears"
957,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,to have governed a part only. Among obvious tokens of this fact are
958,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the following. The cities which furnish the Cretan contingent are all
959,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"contained in a limited portion of that island. Now, although general"
960,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,words are employed (Il. ii. 649.) to signify that the force was not
961,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"drawn from these cities exclusively, yet Homer would probably have been"
962,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"more particular, had other places made any considerable contribution,"
963,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"than to omit the names of them all. Again, Crete, though so large and"
964,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"rich, furnishes a smaller contingent than Pylos. And, once more, if it"
965,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"had been united in itself, it is very doubtful whether any ruler of so"
966,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,considerable a country would have been content that it should stand
967,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,only as a province of the empire of Agamemnon. In the many passages
968,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of either poem which mention Idomeneus, he is never decorated with a"
969,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"title implying, like that of Minos (Κρήτῃ ἐπίουρος), that he was ruler"
970,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of the whole island. Indeed, one passage at least appears to bear"
971,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"pretty certain evidence to the contrary. For Ulysses, in his fabulous"
972,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"but of course self-consistent narration to Minerva, shows us that even"
973,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the Cretan force in Troy was not thoroughly united in allegiance to a
974,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"single head. ‘The son of Idomeneus,’ he says, ‘endeavoured to deprive"
975,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"me of my share of the spoil, because I did not obey his father in"
976,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Troas, but led a band of my own:’"
977,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
978,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,οὕνεκ’ ἄρ’ οὐχ ᾧ πατρὶ χαριζόμενος θεράπευον

983,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"So likewise in the youth of Nestor, two generations back, Augeias"
984,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"appears as the sole king of the Epeans; but, in the Catalogue, his"
985,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,grandson Polyxeinus only commands one out of the four Epean divisions
986,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of ten ships each, without any sign of superiority: of the other"
987,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"three, two are commanded by generals of the Actorid family, which"
988,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,in the earlier legend appears as part of the court or following of
989,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Augeias[21]. And wherever we find in the case of any considerable
990,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Greek contingent the chief command divided among persons other than
991,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"brothers, we may probably infer that there had been a breaking up of"

1046,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1047,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,It is quite clear that these two divisions were acephalous. As to the
1048,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Elians, because the Catalogue expressly divides the 40 ships into four"
1049,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"squadrons, and places one under each leader, two of these being of the"
1050,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Actorid house, and a third descended from Augeias. As to the Bœotians,"
1051,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the Catalogue indicates the equality of the leaders by placing the five
1052,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,names in a series under the same category.
1053,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1054,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,An indirect but rather strong confirmation is afforded by the passage

1068,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,and Drakios. The addition of the patronymic to Meges seems in this
1069,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,place to mark his position; which is distinctly defined as the chief
1070,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"one in the Catalogue, by his being mentioned there alone."
1071,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1072,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"5. Phthians, under Medon and Podarces. These supplied two contingents,"
1073,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,numbered 17 and 19 respectively in the list just given; and they

1075,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1076,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,It will be remarked that the Poet enumerates the commanders of the
1077,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Athenians, Epeans, and Phthians; but not of the Locrians and Bœotians."
1078,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Obviously, in the case of the Locrians, the reason is, that Oilean"
1079,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Ajax, a king and chief of the first rank, and a person familiar to us"
1080,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"in every page, was their leader. Such a person he never mixes on equal"
1081,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"terms with secondary commanders, or puts to secondary duties; and"
1082,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the text immediately proceeds to tell us he was with the Telamonian
1083,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Ajax[23]. But why does it not name the Bœotian leader? Probably, we"
1084,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"may conjecture, because that force had no one commander in chief,"
1085,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"but were an aggregation of independent bodies, whom ties of blood or"
1086,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,neighbourhood drew together in the armament and in action.

1090,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Having thus endeavoured to mark the partial and small beginnings of
1091,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"disorganization in the ancient form of government, let us now observe"
1092,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the character of the particular spots where they are found. These
1093,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"districts by no means represent, in their physical characteristics, the"
1094,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"average character of Greece. In the first place, they are both on the"
1095,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"highway of the movement between North and South. In the second, they"
1096,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"both are open and fertile countries; a distinction which, in certain"
1097,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"local positions, at certain stages of society, not only does not favour"
1098,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the attainment of political power, but almost precludes its possession."
1099,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,The Elis of Homer is marked by two epithets having a direct reference
1100,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"to fertility of soil; it is ἱππόβοτος, horse-feeding, and it is also"
1101,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"εὐρύχορος, wide-spaced or open. Again, the twenty-nine towns assigned"
1102,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,in the Catalogue to the Bœotians far exceed in number those which
1103,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,are named for any other division of Greece. We have other parallel
1104,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,indications; such as the wealth of Orchomenos[24]; and of Orestius
1105,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"with the variegated girdle. He dwelt in Hyle, one of the twenty-nine,"
1106,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"amidst other Bœotians who held a district of extreme fertility[25],"
1107,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"μάλα πίονα δῆμον ἔχοντες. Now when we find signs like these in Homer,"
1108,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"that Elis and Bœotia had been first subjected to revolution, not in the"
1109,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"shape of mere change of dynasty, but in the decomposition, so to speak,"
1110,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of their ancient forms of monarchy, we must again call to mind that"
1111,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Thucydides[26], when he tells us that the best lands underwent the most"
1112,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"frequent social changes by the successions of new inhabitants, names"
1113,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Bœotia, and ‘most of Peloponnesus’ as examples of the kind of district"

1120,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,[26] Thuc. i. 2.
1121,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1122,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Upon the whole, the organization of the armament for Troy shows us the"
1123,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,ancient monarchical system intact in by far the greater part of Greece.
1124,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"But when we come to the Odyssey, we find increasing signs of serious"
1125,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"changes; which doubtless were then preparing the way, by the overthrow"
1126,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of old dynasties, for the great Dorian invasion. And it is here worth"
1127,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,while to remark a great difference. The mere supervention of one race
1128,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"upon another, the change from a Pelasgian to an Hellenic character,"
1129,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,does not appear to have entailed alterations nearly so substantial in
1130,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the character and stability of Hellenic government, as did the Trojan"
1131,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"expedition; which, by depriving societies of their natural heads,"
1132,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and of the fighting men of the population, left an open field to the"
1133,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,operation of disorganizing causes.
1134,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1135,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Strabo has a remarkable passage, though one in which he makes no"
1136,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"particular reference to Homer, on the subject of the invasions and"
1137,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"displacements of one race by another. These, he says[27], had indeed"
1138,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,been known before the Trojan war: but it was immediately upon the
1139,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"close of the war, and then after that period, that they gained head:"
1140,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"μάλιστα μὲν οὖν κατὰ τὰ Τρωικὰ, καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα, τὰς ἐφόδους γένεσθαι"
1141,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"καὶ τὰς μεταναστάσεις συνέβη, τῶν τε βαρβάρων ἅμα καὶ τῶν Ἑλλήνων ὁρμῇ"
1142,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,τινὶ χρησαμένων πρὸς τὴν τῶν ἀλλοτρίων κατάκτησιν. Of this the Odyssey

1148,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1149,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Among many alleged and some real shades of difference between the
1150,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"poems, we may note two of a considerable political significance: the"
1151,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"word _King_ in the Odyssey has acquired a more lax signification, and"
1152,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the word _Queen_, quite unknown to the Iliad, has come into free use."
1153,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1154,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,~_Altered meaning of ‘King.’_~
1155,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1156,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"It will be shown how strictly, in the Iliad, the term βασιλεὺς, with"
1157,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"its appropriate epithets, is limited to the very first persons of the"
1158,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Greek armament. Now in the Odyssey there are but two States, with"
1159,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the organization of which we have occasion to become in any degree
1160,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"acquainted: one of them Scheria, the other Ithaca. Of the first we do"
1161,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"not see a great deal, and the force of the example is diminished by the"
1162,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,avowedly mythical or romantic character of the delineation: but the
1163,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"fact is worthy of note, that in Scheria we find there are twelve kings"
1164,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of the country, with Alcinous[28], the thirteenth, as their superior"
1165,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and head. It is far more important and historically significant that,"
1166,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"in the limited and comparatively poor dominions of Ulysses, there are"
1167,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"now many kings. For Telemachus says[29],"
1168,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,

1175,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1176,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,His meaning must be to refer to the number of nobles who were now
1177,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"collected, from Cephallonia and the other dominions of Ulysses, into"
1178,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,that island. The observation is made by him in reply to the Suitor
1179,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Antinous, who had complained of his bold language, and hoped he never"
1180,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,would be king in Ithaca[30]:

1186,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1187,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"It is, I think, clear, that in this place Antinous does not mean"
1188,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"merely, ‘I hope you will not become one of us,’ which might be said in"
1189,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,reference merely to the contingency of his assuming the controul of his
1190,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"paternal estates, but that he refers to the sovereignty properly so"
1191,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"called: for Telemachus, after having said there are many βασιλῆες in"
1192,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Ithaca, proceeds to say, ‘Let one of them be chosen’, or ‘one of these"
1193,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"may be chosen, to succeed Ulysses;’"
1194,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1195,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"τῶν κέν τις τόδ’ ἔχῃσιν, ἐπεὶ θάνε δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς."
1196,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1197,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"‘but let me,’ he continues, ‘be master of my own house and property.’"
1198,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Thus we have βασιλεὺς bearing two senses in the very same passage.
1199,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"First, it means the noble, of whom there are many in the country, and"
1200,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"it is here evidently used in an improper sense; secondly, it means"
1201,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the person who rules the whole of them, and it is here as evidently"
1202,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,employed in its original and proper signification. It seems very
1203,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"doubtful, however, whether, even in the Odyssey, the relaxed sense"
1204,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,ever appears as a simple title in the singular number. The only signs
1205,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,of it are these; Antinous is told that he is _like_ a king[31] in
1206,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,appearance; and he is also expressly called βασιλεὺς in the strongly
1207,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,and generally suspected νεκυΐα of the Twenty-fourth Book[32]. So
1208,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"again, the kingly epithet Διοτρεφὴς is not used in the singular for"
1209,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"any one below the rank of a βασιλεὺς of the Iliad, except once, where,"
1210,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"in addressing Agelaus the Suitor, it is employed by Melanthius, the"
1211,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"goatherd, one of the subordinate adherents and parasites of that"

1227,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1228,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"1. δέσποινα is applied, Od. iii. 403, to the wife of Pisistratus, son"

1231,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1232,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"2. ἄνασσα is applied in the Iliad, xiv. 326, to Ceres only; but in the"

1235,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,she is a divinity or a mortal. I would not however dwell strongly on
1236,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,this distinction between the poems; for we seem to find substantially
1237,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the human use of the word ἄνασσα in the name of Agamemnon’s daughter,"
1238,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Ἰφιάνασσα, which is used in Il. ix. 145."
1239,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1240,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,3. Βασίλεια is used many times in the Odyssey; and is applied to

1243,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"_b._ Tyro, daughter of Salmoneus, Od. xi. 258; but only in the phrase"

1247,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1248,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Now it cannot be said that the use of the word is forborne in the
1249,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Iliad from the want of fit persons to bear it; for Hecuba, as the wife"
1250,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of Priam, and Helen, as the wife of Paris, possibly also Andromache,"
1251,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"(though this is much more doubtful[34],) were all of a rank to have"
1252,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,received it: nor can we account for its absence by their appearing only
1253,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"as Trojans; for the title of βασιλεὺς is frequently applied to Priam,"
1254,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and it is likewise assigned to Paris, though to no other member of the"

1258,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1259,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,We have also two other cases in the Iliad of women who were queens of
1260,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"some kind. One is that of Hypsipyle, who apparently exercised supreme"
1261,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"power[35] in Lemnos, but we are left to inference as to its character:"
1262,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the other is the mother of Andromache[36],"

1270,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"She was what we term a Queen consort, for her husband Eetion was alive"
1271,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"at the time. In the Odyssey we are told that Chloris, whom Neleus"
1272,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"married, reigned at Pylos; ἡ δὲ Πύλου βασίλευε, Od. xi. 285. In this"
1273,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,place the word βασιλεύειν may perhaps imply the exercise of sovereign
1274,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"power. Be this as it may, the introduction of the novel title of Queen"
1275,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,betokens political movement.
1276,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1277,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,There are other signs of advancing change in the character of kingship
1278,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"discernible from the Odyssey, which will be more conveniently"
1279,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"considered hereafter. In the meantime, the two which are already before"
1280,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"us are, it will be observed, exactly in the direction we might expect"
1281,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"from the nature of the Trojan war, and from the tradition of Strabo. We"
1282,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"have before us an effort of the country amounting to a violent, and"
1283,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,also an unnaturally continued strain; a prolonged absence of its best
1284,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"heads, its strongest arms, its most venerated authorities: wives and"
1285,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"young children, infants of necessity in many cases, remain at home. It"
1286,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"was usual no doubt for a ruler, on leaving his country, to appoint some"
1287,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"guardian to remain behind him, as we see from the case of Agamemnon,"
1288,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"(Od. iii. 267,) and from the language of Telemachus, (Od. xv. 89);"
1289,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"but no regent, deputy, or adviser, could be of much use in that stage"
1290,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of society. Again, in every class of every community, there are boys"
1291,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"rapidly passing into manhood; they form unawares a new generation,"
1292,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and the heat of their young blood, in the absence of vigorous and"
1293,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"established controul, stirs, pushes forward, and innovates. Once more,"
1294,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"as extreme youth, so old age likewise was ordinarily a disqualification"
1295,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"for war. And as we find Laertes and Peleus, and Menœtius, with Admetus,"
1296,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"besides probably other sovereigns whom Homer has not named to us, left"
1297,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"behind on this account, so there must have been many elderly men of the"
1298,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"class of nobles (ἀριστῆες, ἔξοχοι ἄνδρες) who obtained exemption from"
1299,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"actual service in the war. There is too every appearance that, in some"
1300,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"if not all the states of Greece, there had been those who escaped from"
1301,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,service on other grounds; perhaps either from belonging to the elder
1302,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"race, which was more peculiarly akin to Troy, or from local jealousies,"
1303,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"or from the love of ease. For in Ithaca we find old men, contemporaries"
1304,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and seniors of Ulysses, who had taken no part in the expedition; and"
1305,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"there are various towns mentioned in different parts of the poems,"
1306,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,which do not appear from the Catalogue to have made any contribution to
1307,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the force. Such were possibly the various places bearing the name of
1308,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Ephyre, and with higher likelihood the towns offered by Agamemnon to"
1309,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,be made over to Achilles[37].
1310,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1311,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,[37] There is a _nexus_ of ideas attached to these towns that excites
1312,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,suspicion. It would have been in keeping with the character of
1313,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Agamemnon to offer them to Achilles, on account of his having already"
1314,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,found he could not control them himself. No one of them appears in the
1315,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Catalogue. Nor do we hear of them in the Nineteenth Book, when the"
1316,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"gifts are accepted. It seems, however, just possible that the promise"
1317,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,by Menelaus of the hand of his daughter Hermione to Neoptolemus may
1318,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,have been an acquittance of a residue of debt standing over from the
1319,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"original offer of Agamemnon, out of which the seven towns appear to"
1320,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,have dropped by consent of all parties.
1321,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1322,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,~_Disorganization caused by the War._~
1323,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1324,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Again, as Cinyres[38] the ruler of Cyprus, and Echepolus[39] the son"
1325,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of Anchises, obtained exemption by means of gifts to Agamemnon, so"
1326,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"may others, both rulers and private individuals, have done. But the"
1327,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"two main causes, which would probably operate to create perturbation"
1328,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"in connection with the absence of the army, were, without much doubt,"
1329,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"first, the arrival of a new race of youths at a crude and intemperate"
1330,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"manhood; and secondly, the unadjusted relations in some places of the"
1331,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"old Pelasgian and the new Hellenic settlers. Their differences, when"
1332,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the pressure of the highest established authority had been removed,"
1333,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,would naturally in many places spring up afresh. In conformity with
1334,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the first of these causes, the Suitors as a body are called very"
1335,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"commonly νεοὶ ὑπερηνορέοντες[40], ‘the domineering youths.’ And the"
1336,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"circumstances under which Ulysses finds himself, when he has returned"
1337,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"to Ithaca, appear to connect themselves also with the latter of the"
1338,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"above-named causes. But, whatever the reasons, it is plain that his"
1339,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"position had become extremely precarious. Notwithstanding his wealth,"
1340,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"ability, and fame, he did not venture to appeal to the people till he"
1341,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,had utterly destroyed his dangerous enemies; and even then it was only
1342,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"by his promptitude, strength of hand, and indomitable courage, that he"
1343,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,succeeded in quelling a most formidable sedition.

1352,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1353,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Nothing, then, could be more natural, than that, in the absence of the"

1355,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"mother should become the depositary of an authority, from which, as we"
1356,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"see by other instances, her sex does not appear to have excluded her:"
1357,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and that if, as is probable, the instances were many and simultaneous,"
1358,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,this systematic character given to female rule should have its formal
1359,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"result on language in the creation of the word Queen, and its twin"
1360,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"phrase δέσποινα, or Mistress. The extension of the word ἄνασσα from"
1361,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,divinities to mortals might result from a subaltern operation of the
1362,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,same causes.
1363,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1364,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"In the very same manner, the diminished force of authority at its"
1365,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,centre would increase the relative prominence of such among the nobles
1366,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"as remained at home. On reaching to manhood, they would in some cases,"
1367,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"as in Ithaca, find themselves practically independent. The natural"
1368,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"result would be, that having, though on a small scale, that is to say,"
1369,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,so far probably as their own properties and neighbourhoods respectively
1370,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"were concerned, much of the substance of sovereignty actually in"
1371,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"their hands, they should proceed to arrogate its name. Hence come the"
1372,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"βασιλῆες of Ithaca and the islands near it; some of them young men,"
1373,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"who had become adult since the departure of Ulysses, others of them"
1374,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"old, who, remaining behind him, had found their position effectively"
1375,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"changed, if not by the fact of his departure, yet by the prolongation"

1378,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"The relaxed use, then, of the term βασιλεὺς in the Odyssey, and the"

1380,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,need not qualify the proposition above laid down with respect to the
1381,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"βασιλεὺς of the Iliad. He, as we shall see from the facts of the poem,"
1382,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"stands in a different position, and presents to us a living picture of"
1383,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the true heroic age[41].
1384,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1385,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,[41] I need hardly express my dissent from the account given of the
1386,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"βασιλεὺς and ἄναξ in the note on Grote’s History of Greece, vol. II."
1387,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,p. 84. There is no race in Troas called βασιλεύτατον. Every
1388,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,βασιλεὺς was an ἄναξ; but many an ἄναξ was not a βασιλεύς. It is true
1389,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,that an ἄναξ might be ἄναξ either of freemen or of slaves; but so he
1390,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"might of houses (Od. i. 397), of fishes (Il. xiii. 28), or of dogs (Od."
1391,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,xvii. 318).
1392,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1393,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,~_Altered idea of the Kingly office._~
1394,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1395,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,This change in the meaning of the word King was accompanied by
1396,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,a corresponding change in the idea of the great office which it
1397,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,betokened. It had descended from a more noble to a less noble type. I
1398,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,do not mean by this that it had now first submitted to limitations. The
1399,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,βασιλεὺς of the Greeks was always and essentially limited: and hence
1400,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"probably it was, that the usurper of sole and indefinite power in the"
1401,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"state was so essentially and deeply odious to the Greeks, because it"
1402,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"was felt that he had plundered the people of a treasure, namely, free"
1403,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"government, which they and their early forefathers had possessed from"
1404,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,time immemorial.
1405,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1406,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,It is in the Odyssey that we are first startled by meeting not only
1407,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"a wider diffusion and more lax use of the name of king, but together"
1408,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"with this change another one; namely, a lower conception of the kingly"
1409,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,office. The splendour of it in the Iliad is always associated with
1410,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"duty. In the simile where Homer speaks of corrupt governors, that draw"
1411,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"down the vengeance of heaven on a land by crooked judgments, it is"
1412,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"worthy of remark, that he avoids the use of the word βασιλεύς[42]:"

1418,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1419,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,The worst thing that is even hinted at as within the limits of
1420,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"possibility, is slackness in the discharge of the office: it never"
1421,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,degenerates into an instrument of oppression to mankind. But in the
1422,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Odyssey, which evidently represents with fidelity the political"
1423,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"condition of Greece after the great shock of the Trojan war, we find"
1424,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,that kingship has come to be viewed by some mainly with reference to
1425,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the enjoyment of great possessions, which it implied or brought, and as"
1426,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,an object on that account of mere ambition. Not of what we should call
1427,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"absolutely vicious ambition: it is not an absolute perversion, but it"
1428,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"is a clear declension in the idea, that I here seek to note"

1436,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,This general view of the office as one to be held for the personal
1437,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"enjoyment of the incumbent, is broadly distinguished from such a"
1438,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"case as that in the Iliad, where Agamemnon, offering seven cities"
1439,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"to Achilles[44], strives to tempt him individually by a particular"
1440,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"inducement, drawn from his own undoubtedly rather sordid mind;"

1446,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,The moral causes of this change are in a great degree traceable to the
1447,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"circumstances of the war, and we seem to see how the conception above"
1448,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"expressed was engendered in the mind of Mentor, when he observes[45],"
1449,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,that it is now useless for a king to be wise and benevolent like
1450,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Ulysses, who was gentle like a father to his people, in order that,"
1451,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"like Ulysses, he may be forgotten: so that he may just as well be"
1452,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"lawless in character, and oppressive in action. The same ideas are"
1453,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"expressed by Minerva[46] in the very same words, at the second Olympian"
1454,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"meeting in the Odyssey. It would therefore thus appear, that this"
1455,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,particular step downwards in the character of the governments of the
1456,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"heroic age was owing to the cessation, through prolonged absence,"
1457,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of the influence of the legitimate sovereigns, and to consequent"
1458,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,encroachment upon their moderate powers.

1468,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"monarch, in the person of a certain king Echetus; of whom all we know"
1469,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"is, that he lived somewhere upon the coast of Epirus, and that he was"
1470,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the pest of all mortals that he had to do with. With great propriety,"
1471,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,it is the lawless Suitors who are shown to be in some kind of relation
1472,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"with him; for in the Eighteenth Odyssey they threaten[47] to send Irus,"
1473,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"who had annoyed them in his capacity of a beggar, to king Echetus, that"

1496,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"in the Homeric age, soon passed away; and was hardly to be found"
1497,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"represented by any thing but its φθορὰ, the τυραννὶς or despotism,"
1498,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"which neither recognised limit nor rested upon reverence or upon usage,"
1499,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"but had force for its foundation, was essentially absolute, and could"

1522,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Yet while Hesiod makes it plain that he had seen kingship degraded

1525,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"its power. For, as he says in one of his few fine passages[52], at"
1526,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the birth of a king, the Muses pour dew upon his tongue, that he may"
1527,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"have the gift of gentle speech, and may administer strict justice to"
1528,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the people. He then, or the ancient writer who has interpolated him,"
1529,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"goes on to describe the work of royal oratory, in thoughts chiefly"
1530,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"borrowed from the poems of Homer. But the increase of wealth, and the"
1531,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"multiplication of its kinds through commerce, mocked the simple state"
1532,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of the early kings, and tempted them into a rapacity, before which"
1533,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the barriers of ancient custom gave way: and so, says Thucydides[53],"
1534,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"τὰ πολλὰ τυραννίδες ἐν ταῖς πόλεσι καθίσταντο, τῶν προσόδων μειζόνων"
1535,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,γιγνομένων. The germ of this evil is just discernible in the Agamemnon
1536,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of the Iliad: and it is marked by the epithet of Achilles, who,"
1537,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"when angry, still knows how to strike at the weakest point of his"
1538,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"character, by calling him δημόβορος βασιλεὺς[54], a king who eat up,"
1539,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"or impoverished, those under his command. Whether the charge was in"
1540,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"any great degree deserved or not, we can hardly say. Helen certainly"
1541,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,gives to the Achæan king a better character[55]. But however that may
1542,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"be, the reproach was altogether personal to the man. The reverence due"
1543,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and paid to the office must have been immense, when Ulysses, alone, and"

1559,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Even in the Iliad, indeed, we scarcely find the strictly patriarchal"
1560,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,king. The constitution of the state has ceased to be modelled in any
1561,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,degree on the pattern of the family. The different classes are united
1562,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"together by relations which, though undefined and only nascent, are"
1563,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"yet purely political. Ulysses, in his character of king, had been"
1564,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,gentle _as_ a father[56]; but the idea which makes the king even
1565,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"metaphorically the father of his people is nowhere, I think, to"
1566,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"be found in Homer: it was obsolete. Ethnical, local, and dynastic"
1567,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"changes, often brought about by war, had effaced the peculiar traits"
1568,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of patriarchal kingship, with the exception of the old title of ἄναξ"
1569,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"ἀνδρῶν; and had substituted those heroic monarchies which retained,"
1570,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"in a larger development, so much of what was best in the still older"
1571,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"system. As even these monarchies had begun, before the Trojan war, to"
1572,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"be shaken here and there, and as the Odyssey exhibits to us the state"
1573,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of things when apparently their final knell had sounded, so, in the age"
1574,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of Hesiod, that iron age, when Commerce had fairly settled in Greece,"
1575,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and had brought forth its eldest-born child Competition[57], they had"
1576,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"become a thing of the past. Yet they were still remembered, and still"
1577,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"understood. And it might well be that, long after society had outgrown"
1578,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the forms of patriarchal life, men might nevertheless cling to its"
1579,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,associations; and so long as those associations were represented by old
1580,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"hereditary sovereignties, holding either in full continuity, or by ties"
1581,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and traditions not absolutely broken, much of the spirit of the ancient"

1598,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"favourable notice by Thucydides of the πατρικαὶ βασιλεῖαι, which might"
1599,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,lead to the supposition that the old name of king left a good character

1601,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"notwithstanding the evil association, which events could not fail to"
1602,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,establish between it and the usurpations (τυραννίδες). For when the

1604,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"or had undergone essential changes, as in Sparta, so that βασιλεία no"

1617,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,endeavour to trace the portrait of it which has been drawn in the Iliad
1618,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,of Homer.
1619,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1620,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,~_Notes of Kingship in the Iliad._~
1621,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1622,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"1. The class of βασιλῆες has the epithet θεῖοι, which is never used by"
1623,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Homer except to place the subject of it in some special relation with
1624,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"deity; as for (_a_) kings, (_b_) bards, (_c_) the two protagonists,"
1625,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Achilles and Ulysses, (_d_) several of the heroes who predeceased the"
1626,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"war, (_e_) the herald in Il. iv. 192; who, like an ambassador in modern"
1627,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"times, personally represents the sovereign, and is therefore Διὸς"
1628,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"ἄγγελος ἠδὲ καὶ ἀνδρῶν, Il. i. 334."
1629,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1630,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,2. This class is marked by the exclusive application to it of the
1631,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"titular epithet Διοτρεφής; which, by the relations with Jupiter which"
1632,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"it expresses, denotes the divine origin of sovereign power. The word"
1633,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Διογενὴς has a bearing similar to that of Διοτρεφὴς, but apparently"
1634,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"rather less exclusive. Although at first sight this may seem singular,"
1635,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and we should perhaps expect the order of the two words to be reversed,"
1636,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,it is really in keeping; for the gods had many reputed sons of whom
1637,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"they took no heed, and to be brought up under the care of Jupiter was"
1638,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"therefore a far higher ascription, than merely to be born or descended"
1639,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,from him.
1640,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1641,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"3. To the βασιλεὺς, and to no one else, is it said that Jupiter has"
1642,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"intrusted the sceptre, the symbol of authority, together with the"
1643,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,prerogatives of justice[59]. The sceptre or staff was the emblem of
1644,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,regal power as a whole. Hence the account of the origin and successive
1645,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,deliveries of the sceptre of Agamemnon[60]. Hence Ulysses obtained
1646,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the use of it in order to check the Greeks and bring them back to the
1647,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"assembly, ii. 186. Hence we constantly hear of the sceptre as carried"
1648,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,by kings: hence the epithet σκηπτοῦχοι is applied to them exclusively
1649,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"in Homer, and the sceptre is carried by no other persons, except by"
1650,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"judges, and by herald-serjeants, as their deputies."

1657,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,themselves; and in this capacity they form the βουλὴ or council of
1658,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the army. Thus when Achilles describes the distribution of prizes by
1659,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Agamemnon to the principal persons of the army, he says[61],"
1660,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1661,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,[61] Il. ix. 334.
1662,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1663,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"ἄλλα δ’ ἀριστήεσσι δίδου γέρα, καὶ βασιλεῦσιν."
1664,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1665,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,In this place the Poet seems manifestly to distinguish between the
1666,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,class of kings and that of chiefs.
1667,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1668,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,When he has occasion to speak of the higher order of chiefs who usually
1669,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"met in council, he calls them the γέροντες[62], or the βασιλῆες[63]:"
1670,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"but when he speaks of the leaders more at large, he calls them by"
1671,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"other names, as at the commencement of the Catalogue, they are ἀρχοὶ,"
1672,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"ἡγεμόνες, or κοίρανοι: and, again, ἀριστῆες[64]. In two places, indeed,"
1673,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,he applies the phrase last-named to the members of that select class
1674,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,of chiefs who were also kings: but there the expression is ἀριστῆες
1675,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Παναχαιῶν[65], a phrase of which the effect is probably much the same"
1676,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,as βασιλῆες Ἀχαιῶν: the meaning seems to be those who were chief over
1677,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"all orders of the Greeks, that is to say, chiefs even among chiefs."
1678,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Thus Agamemnon would have been properly the only βασιλεὺς Παναχαιῶν.

1699,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,trait; that no other person seems ever to be associated with them on an
1700,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"equal footing in the command of the force, even where it was such as to"
1701,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"require subaltern commanders. Agamemnon, Menelaus, Nestor, Ulysses, the"
1702,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"two Ajaxes, Achilles, are each named alone. Idomeneus is named alone as"
1703,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"leader in opening the account of the Cretans, ii. 645, though, when he"
1704,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"is named again, Meriones also appears (650, 1), which arrangement seems"
1705,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"to point to him as only at most a quasi-colleague, and ὀπάων. Sthenelus"
1706,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and Euryalus are named after Diomed (563-6), but it is expressly added,"
1707,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1708,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,συμπάντων δ’ ἡγεῖτο βοὴν ἀγαθὸς Διομήδης.
1709,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1710,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Thus his higher rank is not obscured. Again, we know that, in the case"
1711,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of Achilles, there were five persons, each commanding ten of his fifty"
1712,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"ships (Il. xvi. 171), of whom no notice is taken in the Catalogue"
1713,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"(681-94), though it begins with a promise to enumerate all those who"
1714,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"were in command of the fleet (493),"
1715,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1716,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,ἀρχοὺς αὖ νηῶν ἐρέω νῆάς τε προπάσας;
1717,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1718,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,and in the case of the Elians he names four leaders who had exactly the
1719,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"same command, each over ten ships (618). It thus appears natural to"
1720,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,refer his silence about the five to the rank held by Achilles as a king.

1750,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Among the indications, by which the last-named chief is shown to have"

1752,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,(Il. ii. 404-6) among the γέροντες ἀριστῆες Παναχαιῶν: where all the

1755,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,and are called in ver. 86 the σκηπτοῦχοι βασιλῆες. Another proof of
1756,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the rank of Oilean Ajax is the familiar manner in which his name is
1757,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"associated on terms of equality, throughout the poem, with that of Ajax"
1758,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Telamonius.
1759,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1760,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"But the part of the poem, which supplies the most pointed testimony as"

1762,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Tenth Book.
1763,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1764,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Here we begin with the meeting of Agamemnon and Menelaus (ver. 34).
1765,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Next, Menelaus goes to call the greater Ajax and Idomeneus (53), and"
1766,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Agamemnon to call Nestor (54, 74). Nestor awakens Ulysses (137); and"
1767,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"then Diomed (157), whom he sends to call Oilean Ajax, together with"
1768,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Meges (175). They then conjointly visit the φύλακες or watch, commanded"
1769,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"by Thrasymedes, Meriones, and others (ix. 80. x. 57-9). Nestor gives"
1770,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the watch an exhortation to be on the alert, and then reenters within"

1775,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1776,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"The force of the term βασιλῆες, as marking off a certain class, is"
1777,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"enhanced by the lines which follow, and which tell us that with them,"
1778,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the kings τοῖς δ’ ἅμα, went Meriones and Thrasymedes by special"

1785,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,who did join it are evidently βασιλῆες. But we are certain that Oilean
1786,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Ajax was among them, because he is mentioned in ver. 228 as one of"

1827,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,for. I therefore infer that Homer did not mean to represent him as
1828,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,having attended; and consequently he is in all likelihood not included
1829,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,among the βασιλῆες by v. 195.

1831,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"2. Phœnix, the tutor and friend of Achilles, is caressingly called"
1832,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,by him Διοτρεφὴς[70] in the Ninth Book; but the petting and familiar
1833,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"character of the speech, and of the whole relation between them, would"
1834,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,make it hazardous to build any thing upon this evidence.

1837,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1838,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,In the Ninth Book it may appear probable that he was among the elders
1839,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"who took counsel with Agamemnon about the mission to Achilles, but it"
1840,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"is not positively stated; and, even if it were, his relation to that"
1841,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,great chieftain would account for his having appeared there on this
1842,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"occasion only (Il. ix. 168). It is remarkable that, at this single"
1843,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"juncture, Homer tells us that Agamemnon collected not simply the"
1844,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"γέροντες, but the γέροντες ἀολλέες, as if there were persons present,"
1845,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,who did not belong to the ordinary Council (Il. ix. 89).
1846,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1847,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Again, in the Nineteenth Book, we are told (v. 303) that the γέροντες"
1848,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Ἀχαιῶν assembled in the encampment of Achilles, that they might urge"
1849,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,him to eat. He refused; and he sent away the ‘other kings;’ but there
1850,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"remained behind the two Atreidæ, Ulysses, Nestor, and Idomeneus, ‘and"
1851,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the old chariot-driving Phœnix.’ The others are mentioned without
1852,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"epithet, probably because they had just been described as kings; and"
1853,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Phœnix is in all likelihood described by these epithets, for the reason"
1854,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,that the term βασιλῆες would not include him (xix. 303-12).
1855,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1856,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"On the whole then, and taking into our view that Phœnix was as a lord,"
1857,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"or ἄναξ, subordinate to Peleus, and that he was a sub-commander in"
1858,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the contingent of Achilles, we may be pretty sure that he was not a"
1859,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"βασιλεύς; if that word had, as has I think been sufficiently shown, a"
1860,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,determinate meaning.
1861,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1862,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,3. Though Patroclus was in the first rank of warriors he is nowhere
1863,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"called βασιλεὺς or Διοτρεφής; but only Διογενὴς, which is a word"
1864,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,apparently used with rather more latitude. The subordinate position of
1865,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Menœtius, the father of Patroclus, makes it improbable that he should"
1866,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,stand as a king in the Iliad. He appears to have been lieutenant to
1867,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Achilles over the whole body of Myrmidons.

1869,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"4. Eurypylus son of Euæmon[71], commander of a contingent of forty"
1870,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"ships, and one of the ten acceptors of the challenge, is in one place"
1871,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,addressed as Διοτρεφής. It is doubtful whether he was meant to be
1872,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"exhibited as a βασιλεὺς, or whether this is a lax use of the epithet;"
1873,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"if it is so, it forms the only exception (apart from ix. 607) to the"

1877,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1878,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Upon the whole, then the evidence of the Iliad clearly tends to"
1879,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"show that the title βασιλεὺς was a definite one in the Greek army,"
1880,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,and that it was confined to nine persons; perhaps with some slight

1912,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Among the bodily qualities of Homeric princes, we may first note"
1913,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"beauty. This attribute is not, I think, pointedly ascribed in the"
1914,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"poems to any person, except those of princely rank. It is needless to"
1915,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,collect all the instances in which it is thus assigned. Of some of
1916,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"them, where the description is marked, and the persons insignificant,"
1917,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"like Euphorbus and Nireus[72], we may be the more persuaded, that Homer"
1918,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,was following an extant tradition. Of the Trojan royal family it is the
1919,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,eminent and peculiar characteristic; and it remains to an observable
1920,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,degree even in the case of the aged Priam[73]. Homer is careful[74]
1921,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,to assert it of his prime heroes; Achilles surpasses even Nireus;
1922,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Ulysses possesses it abundantly, though in a less marked degree; it is"
1923,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"expressly asserted of Agamemnon; and of Ajax, who, in the Odyssey, is"
1924,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,almost brought into competition with Nireus for the second honours; the

1932,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
1933,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Again, with respect to personal vigour as a condition of sovereignty,"
1934,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"it is observed by Grote[75] that ‘an old chief, such as Peleus and"
1935,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Laertes, cannot retain his position.’ There appears to have been some"
1936,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"diversity of practice. Nestor, in very advanced age, and when unable to"
1937,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"fight, still occupies his throne. The passage quoted by Grote to uphold"
1938,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,his assertion with respect to Peleus falls short of the mark: for it
1939,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"is simply an inquiry by the spirit of Achilles, whether his father"
1940,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"is still on the throne, or has been set aside on account of age, and"
1941,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the question itself shows that, during the whole time of the life of"
1942,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Achilles, Peleus, though old, had not been known to have resigned the"
1943,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,administration of the government. Indeed his retention of it appears
1944,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,to be presumed in the beautiful speech of Priam to Achilles (Il. xxiv.

1954,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"The practice of Troy, where we see Hector mainly exercising the"

1956,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,as commands them--appears to have corresponded with that of Greece.
1957,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Achilles, in the Ninth Iliad, plainly implies that he himself was not,"

1971,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"I find a clear proof of the general custom of retirement, probably"
1972,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"a gradual one, in the application to sovereigns of the term αἴζηοι."
1973,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,This word is commonly construed in Homer as meaning youths: but the
1974,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,real meaning of it is that which in humble life we convey by the term
1975,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"able-bodied; that is to say, those who are neither in boyhood nor"
1976,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"old age, but in the entire vigour of manhood. The mistake as to the"
1977,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"sense of the term has created difficulties about its origin, and has"
1978,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"led Döderlein to derive it from αἴθω, with reference, I suppose, to"
1979,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the heat of youth, instead of the more obvious derivation form α and"
1980,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"ζάω, expressing the height of vital power. A single passage will, I"
1981,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"think, suffice to show that the word αἴζηος has this meaning: which is"
1982,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,also represented in two places by the paraphrastic expression αἰζήιος
1983,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"ἀνήρ[78]. In the Sixteenth Iliad, Apollo appears to Hector under the"
1984,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,form of Asius (716):

2028,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
2029,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"This line, in truth, affords an admirable touchstone for the meaning"
2030,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,of two important Homeric words. The vulgar meaning takes Διοτρεφέων
2031,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,αἰζήων as simply illustrious youths. What could Homer mean by cities
2032,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,of illustrious youths? Is it their sovereigns or their fighting
2033,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,population? Were their sovereigns all youths? Were their fighting
2034,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"population all illustrious? In no other place throughout the Iliad,"
2035,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"except one, where the rival reading ἀρηιθόων is evidently to be"
2036,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"adopted, does the Poet apply Διοτρεφὴς to a mass of men[80]. If,"
2037,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"then, the sovereigns be meant, it is plain that they could not all be"
2038,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"youths, and therefore αἴζηος does not mean a youth. But now let us"
2039,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,take Διοτρεφὴς in its strict sense as a royal title only; then let us
2040,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"remember that thrones were only assumed on coming to manhood, as is"
2041,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"plain from the case of Telemachus, who, though his father, as it was"
2042,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"feared, was dead, was not in possession of the sovereign power. ‘May"
2043,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Jupiter,’ says Antinous to him, ‘never make you the βασιλεὺς in Ithaca:"
2044,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"which is your right,’ or ‘which would fall to you by birth[81]:’"
2045,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
2046,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,[80] Nor is it applied in the Odyssey to any bodies more numerous

2048,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,character of kings.

2057,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"entirely, relinquished. Then the sense of Il. ii. 660 will come out"
2058,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,with Homer’s usual accuracy and completeness. It will be that Hercules
2059,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"sacked many cities of prince-warriors, or vigorous and warlike princes."
2060,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
2061,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Thus, then, it was requisite that the Homeric βασιλεὺς should be a"
2062,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"king, a _könig_, a man of whom we could say that actually, and not"
2063,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"conventionally alone, he _can_, both in mind and person. Such was the"
2064,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,theory and such the practice of the Homeric age. There is not a single
2065,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Greek sovereign, with the honourable exception of Nestor, who does"
2066,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,not lead his subjects into battle; not one who does not excel them
2067,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"all in strength of hand, scarcely any who does not also give proofs"
2068,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of superior intellect, where scope is allowed for it by the action of"
2069,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the poem. Over and above the work of battle, the prince is likewise"
2070,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"peerless in the Games. Of the eight contests of the Twenty-third Book,"
2071,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,seven are conducted only by the princes of the armament. The single
2072,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"exception is remarkable: it is the boxing match, which Homer calls"
2073,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"πυγμαχίη ἀλεγεινὴ[82], an epithet that he applies to no other of the"
2074,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,matches except the wrestling.
2075,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
2076,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,[82] Il. xxiii. 653.
2077,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
2078,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"But his low estimation of the boxing comes out in another form, the"
2079,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"value of the prizes. The first prize is an unbroken mule: the second,"
2080,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"a double-bowled cup, to which no epithet signifying value is attached."
2081,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"But for the wrestlers (a contest less dangerous, and not therefore"
2082,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"requiring, on this score, greater inducement to be provided,) the first"
2083,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"prize was a tripod, worth twelve oxen; and the second, a woman slave,"
2084,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"worth four. What, then, was the relative value of an ox and a mule not"
2085,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"yet broken? Mules, like oxen, were employed simply for traction. They"
2086,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"were better, because more speedy in drawing the plough[83]; but, then,"
2087,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"oxen were also available for food, and we have no indication that the"
2088,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,former were of greater value. Without therefore resting too strictly on
2089,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the number twelve, we may say that the prize of wrestling was several"
2090,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"times more valuable than that of boxing. Again, the second prize of the"
2091,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"foot-race was a large and fat ox, equal, probably, to the first prize"
2092,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of the boxing-match[84]. Epeus, who wins the boxing-match against the"
2093,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"prince Euryalus, third leader of the Argives, was evidently a person"
2094,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of traditional fame, from the victory he obtains over an adversary of"
2095,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,high rank. But Homer has taken care to balance this by introducing
2096,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"a confession from the mouth of Epeus himself, that he was good for"
2097,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,nothing in battle[85];

2115,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,are but four cases in which we hear of the use of music and song from
2116,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Homer, except the instances of the professional bards. One of these is"
2117,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the boy, who upon the Shield of Achilles plays and sings, in conducting"
2118,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the youths and maidens as they pass from the vineyard with the grapes.
2119,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"It is the bard, who plays to the dancers; but his dignity, and the"
2120,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"composure always assigned to him, probably would not allow of his"
2121,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"appearing in motion with such a body, and on this account the παὶς may"
2122,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"be substituted; of whose rank we know nothing. In the other cases, the"
2123,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"three persons mentioned are all princes: Paris is the first, who had"
2124,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the lighter and external parts of the character of a gentleman, and"
2125,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"who was of the highest rank, yet to whom it may be observed only the"
2126,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"instrument is assigned, and not the song. The second is the sublime"
2127,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Achilles, whose powerful nature, ranging like that of his Poet through"
2128,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"every chord of the human mind and heart, prompts him to beguile an"
2129,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,uneasy solitude by the Muse; and who is found in the Ninth Iliad[86] by
2130,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the Envoys, soothing his moody spirit with the lyre, and singing, to"
2131,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"strains of his own, the achievements of bygone heroes. Again, thirdly,"
2132,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"this lyre itself, like the iron globe of the Twenty-third Book, had"

2139,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"thing above, so, without stooping, must it be master of every thing"
2140,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"beneath it. Accordingly, the Poet has given it the last touch in the"
2141,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,accomplishments of Ulysses. As he proves himself a wood-cutter and
2142,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"ship-builder in the island of Calypso, so he is no stranger to the"
2143,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,plough and the scythe; and he fairly challenges[87] Eurymachus the

2156,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"heaped upon his characters by Homer, as if they were detailed in a"
2157,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,boarding-school catalogue. The Homeric king should have that which
2158,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,incorporates and harmonizes them all: he should be emphatically a
2159,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"gentleman, and that in a sense not far from the one familiar to the"
2160,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Christian civilization of Europe. Nestor, Diomed, Menelaus, are in a"
2161,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,marked manner gentlemen. Agamemnon is less so; but here Homer shows his
2162,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"usual discrimination, for in Agamemnon there is a sordid vein, which"
2163,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"most of all mars this peculiar tone of character. It is, however, in"
2164,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the two superlative heroes of the poems, that we see the strongest"
2165,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"development of those habits of feeling and action, which belong to the"
2166,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,gentleman. It will be admitted that one of these traits is the love of
2167,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"that which is straightforward, truthful, and above-board. According to"
2168,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the vulgar conception of the character of Ulysses, he has no credit"
2169,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,for this quality. But whatever the Ulysses of Virgil or of Euripides
2170,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"may be, the Ulysses of Homer, though full of circumspection, reserve,"
2171,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and even stratagem in dealing with enemies and strangers, has nothing"
2172,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"about him of what is selfish, tricky, or faithless. And, accordingly,"
2173,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"it is into his mouth that Homer has put the few and simple words,"
2174,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"which rebuke the character of the informer and the tale-bearer, with"
2175,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"a severity greater perhaps even than, under the circumstances, was"
2176,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"necessary. When he is recognised by Euryclea, he strictly enjoins upon"
2177,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"her the silence, on which all their lives at the moment depended. Hurt"
2178,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,by the supposition that she could (in our homely phrase) be likely to
2179,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"blab, she replies that she will hold herself in, hard as stone or as"
2180,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"iron. She adds, that she will point out to him which of the women in"
2181,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the palace are faithful, and which are guilty. No, he replies; I will"

2227,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"offer, he hails them all personally, without waiting to be addressed"
2228,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and with the utmost kindness[91], as of all the Greeks the dearest to"
2229,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,him even in his wrath; he of course proceeds to order an entertainment
2230,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,for them. But the most refined of all his attentions is that shown
2231,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"to Agamemnon in the Twenty-third Book. Inferior to Ajax, Diomed, and"
2232,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Ulysses, Agamemnon could not enter into the principal games, to be"
2233,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"beaten by any abler competitor, without disparagement to his office:"
2234,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,while there would also have been a serious disparagement of another

2252,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"yet, when the Trojan king[92] has called up before his mind the image"

2255,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"for his son, and lets his griefs overflow in a deep compassion for"
2256,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the aged suppliant before him. Nor is it only in sorrow that we may
2257,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,remark a high susceptibility. The Greek chieftains in general are
2258,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,acutely sensible of praise and of blame. Telemachus[93] is delighted
2259,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"when Ægyptius commends him as a likely looking youth: and even Ulysses,"
2260,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"first among them all in self-command, is deeply stung by the remark of"
2261,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the saucy Phæacian on his appearance, and replies upon the offender"
2262,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"with excellent sense, but with an extraordinary pungency[94]. A similar"

2276,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,The hereditary character of the royal office is stamped upon almost
2277,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"every page of the poems; as nearly all the chiefs, whose lineage we are"
2278,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"able to trace, have apparently succeeded their fathers in power. The"
2279,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"only exception in the order, of which we are informed, is one where,"
2280,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"probably on account of the infancy of the heir, the brother of the"
2281,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"deceased sovereign assumes his sceptre. In this way Thyestes, uncle to"
2282,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Agamemnon, succeeded his father Atreus, and then, evidently without any"
2283,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"breach of regularity, transmitted it to Agamemnon."
2284,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
2285,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"And such is probably the reason why, Orestes being a mere child[96],"
2286,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,a part of the dignity of Agamemnon is communicated to Menelaus. For
2287,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,in the Iliad he has a qualified supremacy; receives jointly with

2303,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Among other points which it illustrates, is that of the succession"
2304,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"to sovereignty. It was admitted by the Suitors, that it descended to"
2305,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"him from his father[98]. Yet there evidently was some special, if not"
2306,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"formal act to be done, without which he could not be king. For Antinous"
2307,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,expresses his hope that Jupiter will never make Telemachus king of
2308,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Ithaca. Not because the throne was full, for, on the contrary, the"
2309,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,death of Ulysses was admitted or assumed to have occurred[99]; but
2310,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"apparently because this act, whatever it was, had not been performed in"

2320,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,The answer too of the young prince[100] (τῶν κέν τις τόδ’ ἔχῃσιν)

2323,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"action on the part of the subjects or of a portion of them, had to"
2324,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,be gone through. But the personal dignity of the son of Ulysses was
2325,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,unquestioned. Even the Suitors pay a certain regard to it in the midst
2326,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,of their insolence: and when the young prince goes into the place of
2327,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"assembly[101], he takes his place upon his father’s seat, the elders"
2328,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,spontaneously making way for him to assume it.

2338,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,right of the eldest to succeed. Whether the rights of primogeniture
2339,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"were acknowledged among the Greeks of the heroic age, is a question of"
2340,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"much interest to our own. For, on the one hand, there is a disposition"
2341,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"to canvass and to dispute those rights. On the other hand, we live"
2342,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"in a state of society, to which they probably have contributed more"
2343,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"largely than any other specific cause, after the Christian religion,"
2344,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,to give its specific form. Homer has supplied us with but few cases
2345,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of brotherhood among his greater characters. We see, however, that"
2346,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Agamemnon everywhere bears the character of the elder, and he appears"
2347,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"to have succeeded in that capacity to the throne of Atreus, while"
2348,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Menelaus, the younger, takes his inheritance in virtue of his wife."
2349,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Tyro, in the Eleventh Odyssey, is said to have borne, on the banks of"
2350,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the Enipeus, the twins Pelias and Neleus. In this passage the order"
2351,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,in which the children are named is most probably that of age[102].
2352,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"We find Pelias reigning in Iolcus, a part of the original country of"
2353,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the Æolids: while Neleus emigrates, and, either by or before marrying"
2354,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Chloris, becomes king of Pylos in the south of Greece[103]. Of the"
2355,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"two brothers Protesilaus and Podarces, the former, who is also the"
2356,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"elder, commands the force from Phylace. He was, however, braver, as"
2357,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"well as older. This statement of the merits, ages, and positions of"
2358,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the two brothers raises a question applicable to other cases where two
2359,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,brothers are joined without ostensible discrimination in command. Of
2360,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,these there are four in the Catalogue. The first is that of Ascalaphus
2361,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and Ialmenus, whom their mother Astyoche bore clandestinely to Mars,"
2362,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"ὑπερώϊον εἰσαναβᾶσα. The expression seems to imply, that it was at a"
2363,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,single birth. But even by this supposition we do not get rid of the
2364,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,idea of seniority in this case; nor can we suppose all the pairs to
2365,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"have been twins. We naturally therefore ask, whether this conjunction"
2366,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"implied equality in command? We may probably venture to answer,"
2367,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"without much doubt, in the negative. On the one hand, there is nothing"
2368,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,unlikely in the supposition that the first named of two brothers was
2369,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the eldest, and had the chief command. While on the other hand it is"
2370,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"certain, that there is no case of two coequal commanders except it be"
2371,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"among these four, which are all cases of brothers; and which, under the"
2372,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"interpretation which seems the most natural one they can receive, would"
2373,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,bear fresh testimony to the prevalence of the custom of primogeniture.
2374,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Again, among the sons of Nestor, who are exhibited to us as surrounding"
2375,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"him in the Third Odyssey, we may perhaps find, from the offices"
2376,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"assigned to them at the solemn sacrifice and otherwise, decisive signs"
2377,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,of primogeniture. Pisistratus steps forward to greet Telemachus on
2378,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"his arrival, and leads him to his seat[104], sleeps near him under"
2379,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the portico, and accompanies him on his journey. But these functions"
2380,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"appertain to him because he was the bachelor (ἠΐθεος) of the family,"
2381,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,as we are appropriately told in reference to his taking a couch near
2382,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the guest, while the married persons always slept in some separate"
2383,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and more private part of the palace[105]. Pisistratus, therefore, was"
2384,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,probably the youngest son. But it is also pretty clear that Thrasymedes
2385,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,was the eldest. For in the sacrifice he strikes the fatal blow at the
2386,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"ox: while Stratius and Echephron bring it up, Aretus holds the ewer"
2387,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and basin, Perseus holds the lamb, Pisistratus cuts up the animal and"
2388,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Nestor performs the religious rites of prayer and sacrifice[106].

2408,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Upon this question, again, an important collateral light is cast by"

2410,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,on the subject of primogeniture among the Hellenes. The Olympian order
2411,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"is founded upon it. It is as the eldest of the three Kronid brothers,"
2412,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and by no other title, that Jupiter stands at the head of the Olympian"
2413,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"community. With respect to the lottery, he is but one of three. His"
2414,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,being the King of Air invests him with no right to command the King of

2417,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"The Erinues, says the Messenger Goddess, attend upon the elder. That"
2418,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"is to say, his rights lie at the foundation of the moral order. Upon"
2419,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"this suggestion, the refractory deity at once succumbs[107]. And,"
2420,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"reciprocally, Jupiter in the Thirteenth Odyssey recognises the claim of"
2421,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Neptune to respect as the _oldest_ and best (of course after himself)

2724,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the head of that house, supported in Lacedæmon by his affectionate"

2726,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"with twin supports, by their marriages with Clytemnestra and Helen"
2727,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,respectively. This family was at the head of the energetic race
2728,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"which ruled, and deserved to rule, in the Greek peninsula; and which"
2729,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,apparently produced such large and full developments of personal
2730,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"character, as the world has never seen, either before or since, at"
2731,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,so infantine a stage of civilization. There were various kings in the
2732,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"army before Troy, but among them all the race of Pelopids was the most"
2733,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"kingly[130]. Agamemnon possessed the courage, strength, and skill of a"
2734,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"warrior, in a degree surpassed only by the very greatest heroes of his"
2735,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"nation; and (according to Homer) evidently exceeding that of Hector,"
2736,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the chief Trojan warrior opposed to him. He must have been still in

2761,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"as he conceives, the fear of Agamemnon operated more powerfully than"

2792,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"motives of the war, fall short of, but are not wholly at variance"
2793,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"with, the opinion which has been expressed by Thucydides. Of the"
2794,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"oath to Tyndareus Homer knows nothing: but he tells us of the oath,"
2795,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,by which the Greek chieftains had bound themselves to prosecute the
2796,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"expedition. Before setting out, they had a solemn ceremonial at Aulis;"
2797,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"they offered sacrifices, they made libations, they swore, they pledged"
2798,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"hands[134], they saw a portent, and had it interpreted by Calchas[135]."
2799,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,But all this only shows that the Atreidæ were conscious how formidable
2800,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"an enterprise they were about, and how they desired accordingly that"
2801,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"their companion kings should, after having once embarked, be as deeply"
2802,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,pledged as possible to go forward. It does not tell us what was the
2803,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"original inducement to enter into the undertaking. Again, it does not"
2804,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,appear that the Greeks in general cared much about the abduction or
2805,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,even the restoration of Helen. The only passage directly touching the
2806,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"point is the one in which Agamemnon[136] expresses his opinion that, if"
2807,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Menelaus should die of his wound, the army would probably return home."
2808,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"It seems as if Agamemnon thought, that without doubt they would then be"
2809,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"in honour released from their engagement, and that they would at once"
2810,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"avail themselves of their freedom. The hope of booty, however, would do"
2811,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,much; and the members of a conquering race unite together with great
2812,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"facility for purposes of war, through a mixture of old fellow-feeling"
2813,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and the love of adventure, as well as through anticipation of spoil."
2814,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"On the other hand, it was evidently no small matter to organize the"
2815,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,expedition: much time was consumed; a friendly embassy to Troy had been
2816,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"tried without success; the ablest princes, Nestor and Ulysses, were"
2817,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"employed in obtaining cooperation. The general conclusion, I think, is,"
2818,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"that a combination of hope, sympathy, respect, and fear, but certainly"
2819,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"a very strong personal feeling, whatever its precise ingredients may"
2820,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"have been, towards the Pelopid house, must have operated largely in"
2821,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the matter. And it is in this spirit that we should construe the
2822,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"various declarations of Homer respecting those who came to the war, as"
2823,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"courting the Atreidæ, and as acting for their honour; namely these,"

2835,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Before Troy, Agamemnon is always regarded by others as responsible for"

2837,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,his sceptre by Ulysses in the great effort to stem the torrent of the
2838,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"retiring multitude, is highly significant of the influence belonging"
2839,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"to his station; and when Ulysses argues with the leaders, he rests his"
2840,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"case on the importance of knowing the whole mind of Agamemnon, while he"
2841,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"strongly dwells on his royal authority, and on the higher authority of"
2842,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,heaven as its foundation.
2843,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
2844,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"His position, however, did not place him above the influence of"
2845,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,jealousy and fear: for he was gratified when he saw Achilles and
2846,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Ulysses, the first of his chieftains, at variance[137]. And his weight"
2847,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and authority depended for their efficacy on reason, and on the free"
2848,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,will of the Greeks. Agamemnon takes Briseis from Achilles by an act

2852,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,particular chiefs and of the troops. Achilles not only declares that

2854,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,asks Phœnix to remain in his tent for the purpose. The deference paid
2855,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,to the Head is a deference according to measure; and the measure is
2856,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"that of his greater responsibility, his heavier stake in the war[139]."
2857,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"His functions in regard to the host are, to think for and advise it in"

2872,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"a man of genius. But on this very account, the dominance of political"
2873,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,ideas in his mind is more remarkable. On political grounds he is ready
2874,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,to give up Chryseis[140]. On political grounds he quells his own
2875,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"avarice, and slays Trojans instead of taking ransom for them[141]. He"
2876,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"deeply feels the responsibilities of his station, and care banishes"
2877,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,his sleep. The amiable trait in his character is his affection for
2878,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Menelaus, and in this, as in many other respects, he recalls the"
2879,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Jupiter of Homer, whose selfishness is nowhere relieved, except by"

2888,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"later politicians. He resembles them, too, in outwitting himself by"
2889,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"means of it: he is ‘hoist upon his own petard.’ This seems to be, in"
2890,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"part at least, the explanation of his unhappy device in the Second"
2891,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Iliad, to prepare the people for an attack on Troy, by counselling them"
2892,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"to go home forthwith. The breakdown of his scheme is, as it were, the"

2895,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"As, upon the whole, there is no idea of selfishness involved in the"
2896,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"prerogatives of the Homeric king, so is it clear that, except as"
2897,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"against mere criminals, there is no general idea of coercion. The"
2898,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Homeric king reigns with the free assent of his subjects--an assent
2899,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"indeterminate, but real, and in both points alike resembling his"
2900,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,kingly power. The relation between ruler and ruled is founded in the
2901,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"laws and condition of our nature. Born in a state of dependence, man,"
2902,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"when he attains to freedom and capacity for action, finds himself the"
2903,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,debtor both of his parents and of society at large; and is justly
2904,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,liable to discharge his debt by rendering service in return. Of
2905,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"this we have various indications in Homer, with respect to parents"
2906,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"in particular. Those who die young, like Simoeisius by the hand of"

2931,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,~_The relation of sovereign and subject free._~
2932,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
2933,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"As to the relation between the subject and the sovereign authority,"
2934,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,it seems everywhere to be taken for granted. In the Twenty-fourth
2935,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Odyssey, the object of those who march against Ulysses is not to put"
2936,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"down authority, but to avenge the deaths of their sons and brothers."
2937,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,But there appears nowhere in Homer the idea that in this relation
2938,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"could be involved a difference of interest, or even of opinion, between"
2939,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"class and class, between governors and governed. The king or chief"
2940,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"was uplifted to set a high example, to lead the common counsels to"
2941,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"common ends, to conduct the public and common intercourse with heaven,"
2942,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"to decide the strifes of individuals, to defend the borders of the"
2943,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"territory from invasion. That the community at home, or any regularly"
2944,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"subsisting class of it, could require repression or restraint from the"
2945,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"government, was an idea happily unknown to the Homeric times."
2946,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
2947,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Those classes, indeed, were few and simple. There was, first of all,"
2948,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the king; and round him his family and his κήρυκες, the serjeants or"
2949,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"heralds, who were his immediate, and apparently his only immediate,"
2950,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"agents. They conveyed his orders; they assisted him in the Assembly,"
2951,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"in sacrifice, and in banquets. They appear to be the only executive"
2952,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"officers that are found in Homer. With these was the Bard, apparently"
2953,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,also an indispensable member of royal households. Both were recognised
2954,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,among the established professions.
2955,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
2956,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Next to the kings and other sovereigns, we must place the chief"
2957,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"proprietors of the country. In the Odyssey, we find the members of the"
2958,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"aristocracy having their own estates and functions, and sustaining the"
2959,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"part of γέροντες, or leaders in the Assembly. The judicial office,"
2960,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"as we have seen from the Shield and otherwise, was in their hands,"
2961,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"probably by delegation. But it would appear, that the distinction"
2962,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"between them and the sovereign family was rather a broad one; since,"
2963,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"in almost every case, we seem to find the prince contracting a"
2964,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,marriage beyond his own borders. Laertes brings Anticlea[145] from
2965,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the neighbourhood of Parnassus; Theseus marries Ariadne from Crete;
2966,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Agamemnon and Menelaus, belonging to Mycenæ, are united to the"
2967,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"daughters of the king of Sparta; of the two daughters of Icarius,"
2968,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Ulysses in Ithaca married Penelope, and Eumelus in Pheræ married"
2969,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Iphthime (Od. iv. 797); one of the two, at least, and perhaps both,"
2970,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,must have married from a considerable distance; Menelaus sends his
2971,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,beautiful daughter Hermione to be the wife of Neoptolemus in Thessaly:
2972,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and the only instance, even apparently in the opposite sense, seems"
2973,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"to be that of his son Megapenthes, who married a Spartan damsel, the"
2974,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,daughter of Alector. But then Megapenthes was not legitimate; he was
2975,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"born of a slave-mother, and therefore he was not a prince[146]. All"
2976,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,these facts seem to show us that the royal houses formed a network
2977,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"among themselves, spread over Greece, and keeping pretty distinct from"
2978,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the aristocracy: a circumstance which may, in some degree, help to"
2979,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,explain the wonderful patience and constancy of Penelope.

2989,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"time, both the useful arts and the fine arts had a social dignity, as"
2990,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"compared with that of wealth and station, which the former have long"

2992,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"perhaps might be desired, not for their own advantage merely, but to"
2993,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"secure due honour for labour, and the humanizing effect of this kind of"
2994,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,labour in particular for society at large. I draw the proof of their
2995,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"estimation in the heroic age, first, from the manner in which they are"
2996,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"combined under the common designation of δημιοεργοὶ, and arranged"
2997,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"in a mixed order, the preference being only given by a more emphatic"

3006,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Here I take τέκτονα δούρων to represent the entire class of artificers,"
3007,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of whom many are named in Homer; in a poor country like Ithaca,"
3008,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,depending very much on the use of boats for fishing and for its
3009,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"communications, the carpenters might naturally represent the whole."
3010,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
3011,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"And next, from the manner in which these arts were practised by"
3012,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"princes, it seems plain that there was nothing in the pursuit of them"
3013,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"inconsistent with high rank. The physicians, or surgeons rather, of"
3014,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the Greek army, Podaleirius and Machaon, were themselves princes and"
3015,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"commanders of a contingent: and even Paris, who was not the man to"

3046,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
3047,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,We may remark the absence of priests and merchants. Not that merchants
3048,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"were unknown: we find them mentioned by Euryalus the Phæacian, as"
3049,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"πρηκτῆρες, but their business was esteemed sordid; it too much"
3050,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"resembled that of the kidnapper or swindler, and it is the reproach of"
3051,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,seeming to belong to this class that smartly stings Ulysses[152]. And
3052,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"even the merchant Mentes, whose form was assumed by Pallas, belonged"
3053,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"to the Taphians, a tribe of pirates[153]. As yet, neither the order"

3064,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"After the classes we have named, come the great mass of the population,"
3065,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,who till the ground and tend the live stock for themselves or their
3066,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"employers, if free, and for their lords if slaves. The fisherman, too,"
3067,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,is distinctly noticed[154] in Ithaca. Mr. Grote classes with the free
3068,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"husbandmen the artisans[155], and separates both of them from the"
3069,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"θῆτες, or hired labourers, and the slaves. It appears to me, however,"
3070,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"that we ought to distinguish the artisans from the mere husbandmen, as"
3071,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"having been in a higher station. On the other hand, I see no passage"
3072,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,in Homer which clearly gives to the husbandmen as a class a condition
3073,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"superior to that of the hired servants, or even, perhaps, the slaves."
3074,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,The evidence of the poems is not clear as to the existence or extent of
3075,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,a peasant proprietary. We must beware of confounding those conceptions
3076,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of a slavery maintained wholesale for the purposes of commerce, which"
3077,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"our experience supplies, with its earliest form, in which the number"
3078,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of slaves would seem to have been small, and their ranks to have"
3079,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"been recruited principally by war, with slight and casual aid from"
3080,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"kidnapping. In those times, the liability to captivity would seem to"
3081,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"have affected all men alike, independently of all distinctions whether"
3082,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,in rank or in blood. The sons of Priam were sold into slavery like any
3083,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"one else: the only difference was, that, in proportion to the wealth of"
3084,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the parents, there was a better chance of ransom. It would appear that"
3085,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the slaves of Homer were properly, even when not indoor, yet domestic."
3086,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,The women discharged the indoor and household offices: except that a
3087,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"few men performed strictly personal services about their masters, as"
3088,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,δρηστῆρες and as carvers[156] (θεράποντε δαήμονε δαιτροσυνάων). But
3089,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the men-slaves were more largely employed out of doors in the care
3090,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of flocks and herds, fields and vineyards. Thus, the slaves were in"
3091,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"a different position apparently from the freemen, for they seem to"
3092,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,have been gathered as servants and attendants round the rich. It would
3093,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"appear, however, from the case of Eumæus, who had a slave of his own,"
3094,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Mesaulios[157], that they might hold property for themselves. Again,"
3095,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"not Eumæus only, but in the Twenty-fourth Odyssey Dolius and his six"
3096,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"sons, sit down to table together with Ulysses, and fondly clasp his"
3097,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"hands. They bear arms too; and this could not have been very strange,"
3098,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"for Homer describes the arming of the sons without remark, while he"
3099,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"calls both the father and Laertes, on account of their old age[158],"
3100,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,ἀναγκαῖοι πολεμισταί. The moral deterioration of slaves is noticed very
3101,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"strongly by Eumæus himself[159], though not with reference to himself."
3102,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"We have, however, no reason to suppose that their outward condition was"
3103,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"inferior to that of the free labouring population in any thing, except"
3104,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,that we must presume they did not take part in the assemblies or in
3105,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,war. When Achilles[160] in the infernal regions compares the highest
3106,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"condition there with the lowest on earth, he does not choose the slave,"
3107,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"but the labourer for hire (θητεύεμεν is his expression), as the type"
3108,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,of a depressed condition upon earth. The state of the hired servant
3109,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"probably resembled that of the slave in being dependent upon others,"
3110,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and fell beneath it in the point of security. This is the more likely,"
3111,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"because the point of the passage turns on the poverty of the employer,"

3134,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Indeed, if we consider the matter a little further, we shall perhaps"
3135,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"see the greater reason to think, that the expression θητεύεμεν has been"
3136,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"chosen otherwise than at random. What do we mean by a hired servant, at"
3137,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,a period in the movement of society when money did not exist? We can
3138,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"only mean one who was paid by food, clothes, and lodging, like a slave,"
3139,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"but who was not, like a slave, permanently attached to his master or"
3140,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,his master’s estate. The difference between the two would thus lie in
3141,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the absence of the permanent tie: a difference much more against the
3142,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"θὴς, than in his favour."
3143,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
3144,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"The position, then, of the slaves was probably analogous to that of"
3145,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"domestic servants among ourselves, who practically forfeit the active"
3146,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"exercise of political privileges, but are in many respects better off"
3147,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,than the mass of those who depend on bodily labour. It doubtless grew
3148,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"out of the state of things in which slaves were practically servants,"
3149,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and servants of the rich, that masters, or ἄνακτες[161], were regarded"

3156,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"I stop for a moment to observe, that the view here taken of the"
3157,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,comparatively restricted numbers and sphere of the slaves in heroic
3158,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Greece may serve in some degree to answer the question, why do we not"
3159,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,hear of them in the army of the Iliad? As men of equal blood with the
3160,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Greeks themselves, they would perhaps be dangerous comrades in arms."
3161,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"As persons established in charge of the property of the lord, there"
3162,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,would be a strong motive to leave them behind for its care. It is
3163,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,very difficult to judge how far the state of heroic Greece bore any
3164,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"resemblance to the feudal system of the later middle ages, and whether"
3165,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,it did not present a more substantial correspondence with the allodial
3166,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,system of the earlier. We have before us a large number of independent
3167,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"proprietors, each bound by usage probably to render personal service,"
3168,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,but we have nothing that resembles the obligation to bring so many
3169,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,retainers into the field with reference to the size of the estate.
3170,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"And accordingly, in the Iliad we do not find many merely personal"
3171,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,retainers. The menial services in the tent of Achilles are performed
3172,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"by the women-captives, or by Patroclus in person. After Patroclus was"
3173,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"dead, his tent was attended only by Automedon, his charioteer, and by"
3174,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,one other warrior. Agamemnon had no other male attendants that we hear

3185,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Priam: and again, in the Odyssey we find Ægyptius[164] of Ithaca had"
3186,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"sent one son to Troy, while he kept three at home. The inference"
3187,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,is strengthened[165] by the negative evidence of the Twenty-fourth
3188,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Odyssey. There[166] Dolius the slave appears with no less than six
3189,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,sons: but no mention is made of any member of his family as having
3190,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"attended Ulysses to Troy, although, if there had been such a person,"
3191,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"some reference to him here, in the presence of Ulysses just returned,"
3192,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"would have been most appropriate. Indeed, the six are introduced as"

3206,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"which seemed to imply a brotherhood. They are ‘friends, Danaan heroes,"
3207,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"satellites of Mars[167],’ and it is hard to suppose such words could"
3208,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"be addressed to persons held in slavery, however mild, familiar, or"
3209,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,favourable. The employment of these terms may suggest a comparison
3210,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"with our own modes of public address, according to which the word"
3211,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"‘Gentlemen’ would be commonly used, though the audience should be"

3219,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"It was a natural and healthful sign of the state of political society,"

3221,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of its effects on the mind, and not because it entailed cruelty or"
3222,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"oppression. There is not, I think, a single passage in the poems which"

3228,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Neither, as has been said, is there any thing in Homer, which clearly"
3229,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,exhibits to us a peasant-proprietary; or entitles us positively
3230,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,to assert that the land was cultivated to a great extent by small
3231,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"proprietors, each acting independently for himself. On the one hand, as"
3232,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"has been remarked, we do not find large numbers of personal retainers"
3233,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and servants about the great men: but, on the other hand, Homer does"
3234,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,not paint for us a single picture of the independent peasant. In the
3235,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"similes, in the legends, on the Shield of Achilles, in Ithaca, we"
3236,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"hear much of large flocks and herds, of great proprietors, of their"
3237,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"harvest-fields and their vineyards, but nothing of the small freeman,"
3238,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"with property in land sufficient for his family, and no more. The rural"

3248,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"1. That, as respected primogeniture and the disposition of landed"

3282,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Chrematistic has been devised in its stead; an accurate, but perhaps"

3303,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Hellenes, as well as Pelasgians, appear to have taken kindly. Of this"
3304,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,we find various tokens. Though the spirit of acquisition had not
3305,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"yet reached the point, at which it becomes injurious to the general"
3306,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"development of man, we appear to have in the distinguished house of"
3307,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the Pelopids at least one isolated example of its excess. We have
3308,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the friendly testimony of Nestor, as well as the fierce invective of"
3309,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Achilles[169], to show that in Agamemnon it constituted a weakness: and"
3310,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"he is distinguished in war from the other great chieftains[170], by"
3311,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,his habit of forthwith stripping those whom he had slain. But Ulysses
3312,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"also, to whom we may be certain that Homer did not mean in this matter"
3313,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"to impute a fault, was, according to Eumæus[171], richer than any"
3314,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"twenty; and after making every allowance for friendly exaggeration, we"
3315,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"cannot doubt that Homer meant us to understand that, in the wealth of"
3316,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"those days, he was very opulent. The settlement from time to time of"
3317,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Phœnicians in Greece, and the ready docility of the Hellenes in the"
3318,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"art of navigation, are signs to the same effect. The idea of wealth"
3319,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"again is deeply involved in the name of ὄλβος, which appears to mean"
3320,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"a god-given felicity: and μάκαρ is the epithet in common of the gods,"
3321,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the rich man, and the happy man[172]. Not that the Greeks of those"

3323,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"but that they spoke out in their simplicity, here, as also with other"

3344,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"raiment; and with the possession of somewhat rich works of art, both in"
3345,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"metal and embroidery. This picture seems to belong to a stage, although"
3346,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"a very early one, in a process of rapid advance to material wealth and"
3347,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"prosperity. The wealth and the simplicity of manners, taken together,"

3357,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,It signifies both the obligation to pay a debt regularly contracted for

3359,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"after an act of rapine (Il. xi. 686, 8). The possession of the precious"

3361,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"apparently stood next to them in value, formed prizes at the Games; in"
3362,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"which, speaking generally, only kings and chiefs took part. A certain"
3363,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"approximation had been made towards the use of them as money, that"

3400,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"but we may presume the explanation to be, that Laertes, in time of"

3402,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the Greeks, in a state of war before Troy, had probably more captives"

3410,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Euryclea clears up this point. For what Laertes gave was not the twenty

3432,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"gold, and in copper. If Eurymachus had meant to express the restoration"

3437,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"There is another passage in the poems, which seems to carry a similar"

3439,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Greek camp, the Greeks pay him for his wine, some with copper, some"
3440,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"with iron, some with hides, some with slaves, and some with oxen."
3441,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Slaves, as we have seen, would probably be redundant in the camp. The"
3442,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,same would be eminently the case with respect to hides; since they
3443,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,would be redundantly supplied by the animals continually slaughtered
3444,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"for the subsistence of the army. Even as to the metals, we need not"
3445,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"feel surprise at the passage; for they were acquired largely by spoil,"
3446,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and not greatly needed by the force, since wear and tear scarcely"
3447,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,constitute an element in the question of supply for those times. But
3448,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,it is certainly more startling that any of the Greeks should have sold
3449,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,oxen to the crews of Euneus. Neither in that age nor in this would any
3450,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"merchants carry away oxen from a vast and crowded camp, where they"
3451,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,would be certain to be in the highest demand. I therefore presume the
3452,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"meaning to be as follows; that those particular Greeks, who happened to"
3453,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"have more oxen than they wanted at the moment, sold them to the people"
3454,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of the ships; and that the people of the ships took these oxen, in"
3455,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"exchange for wine, not intending to carry them away, but to sell them"
3456,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"again, perhaps against hides or slaves on the spot, as the live cattle"
3457,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,would be certain to find a ready and advantageous market among other
3458,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Greeks of the army.
3459,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
3460,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Oxen therefore, in that age, seem to have come nearer, than any other"
3461,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"commodity, to the discharge of the functions now performed by the"
3462,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"precious metals: for they were both used to express value, and probably"

3471,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"ornament and for art. This was, no doubt, their proper and established"
3472,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"application; and when they are stored, they are stored in common with"
3473,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"other metals not of the same class, and with a view, in all likelihood,"
3474,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,to manufacture.
3475,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
3476,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,~_Relative scarcity of metals._~
3477,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
3478,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"It appears clear, from the Homeric poems, that silver was more rare"
3479,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"than gold. It is used, when used at all, in smaller quantities: and"
3480,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,it much more rarely appears in the accounts of stored-up wealth. A
3481,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"like inference may be drawn, perhaps, from the books of Moses; and"
3482,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,it corresponds with the anticipations we should reasonably form from
3483,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the fact that gold is found in a native state, and, even when mixed"
3484,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"with other material, is more readily fitted for use. The extensive"
3485,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"employment of silver only arrives, when society is more advanced, and"
3486,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,when the use of money is more familiar and minute. Payments in the
3487,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,precious metals on a somewhat large scale precede those for smaller
3488,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"transactions. We are not however to infer, from the greater rarity of"
3489,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"silver, that it was more valuable than gold: the value depending, not"
3490,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"on the comparative quantities only, but upon the compound ratio of the"
3491,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,quantities as compared with the demand. It would however appear from a
3492,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"passage in the account of the funeral games, that gold, if not silver,"
3493,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"was then much less esteemed than it now is. For, while a silver bowl"
3494,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"was the first prize of the foot-race, a large and fat ox (perhaps worth"
3495,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"three ordinary ones) was the second, and a half talent of gold was only"
3496,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the third[179].
3497,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
3498,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,[179] Il. xxiii. 740-51.
3499,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
3500,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"The position of iron, however, relatively to the other metals, was very"
3501,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,different in the heroic age from what it now is: and probably its great
3502,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"rarity was due, like that of silver, to the difficulty of bringing the"
3503,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,metal into a state fit for use; which could more readily be effected
3504,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"with copper, with tin, or with κύανος, in whatever sense it is to be"
3505,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"interpreted. Iron, however, would appear to have been more valuable"
3506,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"than these metals; greatly more valuable, in particular, than copper,"
3507,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,which is now worth from fifteen to twenty times as much as iron. A
3508,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,mass of crude iron is produced at the funeral games as a prize; and
3509,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"iron made into axe-heads forms another. No other metal, below the rank"
3510,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of gold and silver, is ever similarly employed in an unmanufactured"
3511,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,state.--
3512,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
3513,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Let us now turn to a brief view of the polity and organization of the
3514,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,army.
3515,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
3516,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,We perceive the organization of the Greek communities in a double form:
3517,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"both as a community, properly so called, in time of peace, a picture"
3518,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"supplied by the Odyssey; and likewise as an army, according to the"
3519,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,delineations of the Iliad.
3520,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
3521,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,~_Mode of government of the army._~
3522,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
3523,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,The differences are worth noting: but they do not seem to touch
3524,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,fundamental principles. Agamemnon governed the army by the ordinary
3525,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"political instruments, not by the rules of military discipline."
3526,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Aristotle[180] quotes from the Iliad of his own day and place, and as"
3527,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"proceeding from the mouth of Agamemnon, the words,"
3528,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
3529,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,[180] Pol. iii. 14. 5.
3530,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
3531,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,πὰρ γὰρ ἐμοὶ θάνατος·
3532,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
3533,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and Grote founds upon this citation the remark, that ‘the Alexandrian"
3534,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,critics effaced many traces of the old manners.’ But was this really a
3535,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,trace of the old manners? Is there a single passage now remaining of
3536,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the Iliad, a single thought, a single word, which at all corresponds"
3537,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"with the idea that Agamemnon had in his own hands, in the shape of"
3538,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"a defined prerogative, the power of capital punishment? Aristotle"
3539,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"certainly accepts the passage, and contrasts this military power of"
3540,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Agamemnon with the restraints upon him in the peaceful sphere of the
3541,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,ἀγορή; but I am by no means sure that English institutions do not
3542,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,afford us the aid of far more powerful analogies for appreciating
3543,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the real political spirit of the Homeric poems, than any that even"
3544,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Aristotle could draw in his own day from the orientalizing government
3545,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of Alexander. I do not, however, so much question the passage, as"
3546,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the construction put upon it. The prerogatives of the Greek kings
3547,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"were founded in general duty and feeling, not in law. When Ulysses"
3548,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"belaboured Thersites, it was not in the exercise of a determinate"
3549,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"right, but in obedience to the dictates of general prudence, which,"
3550,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"upon a high emergency, the general sense approved. Doubtless, if"
3551,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Agamemnon had caught a runaway from the ranks, he might have slain him;"
3552,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,but is it supposed that Ulysses might not? What was the meaning of the
3553,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"advice of Nestor, to put the poltroons in the middle of the ranks,"
3554,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,but that their comrades about them should spear them if they should
3555,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"try to run? There is no criminal justice, in the proper sense of the"
3556,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"term, though there is civil justice, in either of the Homeric poems;"
3557,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the wrongs of man to man are adjusted or requited by the latter form
3558,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of remedy, but the ideas on which the former rests were unknown: there"
3559,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"is no king’s peace, more than there is a king’s highway: the sanctions"
3560,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,of force are added upon occasion to the general authority of office by
3561,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"those who bear it, according to the suggestions of their common sense."
3562,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Had it been otherwise, Ulysses would never have put the wretched women"
3563,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"in his household, who could not, like the Suitors their paramours, be"
3564,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"politically formidable, to a death, which fully entitled him to say"
3565,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"with the Agamemnon of the citation, πὰρ γὰρ ἐμοὶ θάνατος. The general"
3566,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"reverence for rank and station, the safeguard of publicity, and the"
3567,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"influence of persuasion, are the usual and sufficient instruments"
3568,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"for governing the army, even as they governed the civil societies of"
3569,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Greece. In the Assembly of the army, the quarrel with Achilles takes"
3570,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,place: in the Assembly arises the tumultuary impulse to return home:
3571,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"in the Assembly, that impulse having been checked, it is deliberately"
3572,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,resolved to see what they can do by fighting: in the Assembly it is
3573,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"determined to ask a truce for burials, and to erect the rampart: in the"
3574,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"nocturnal Assembly that Council is appointed to sit, which sends the"
3575,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,abortive mission to Achilles. Every great measure affecting the whole
3576,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"body is, as we shall find, adopted in the Assembly: and, finally, it"
3577,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"is here that Agamemnon explicitly confesses and laments his fault, and"
3578,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,that the reconciliation with Achilles is ratified.
3579,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
3580,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"We may therefore take the polity, so to speak, of the Greek army into a"
3581,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,common view with that of the Ithacan ἀγορή; but first it will be well
3582,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,to sketch its military organization.
3583,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
3584,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,~_Its military composition._~
3585,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
3586,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Next to the βασιλῆες came the ἔξοχοι ἄνδρες (Il. ii. 188), or ἀριστῆες,"
3587,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,of the Greek army. They are pretty clearly distinguished from the
3588,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"kings in the speech of Achilles (ix. 334); when, after describing the"
3589,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"niggardliness of Agamemnon with respect to booty, he goes on to say,"
3590,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
3591,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,ἄλλα δ’ ἀριστήεσσι δίδου γέρα καὶ βασιλεῦσιν·
3592,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
3593,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"which I understand to mean, he gave to these two classes prizes"
3594,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"different, i. e. proportioned to their respective stations."
3595,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
3596,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,The language of the Catalogue pointedly marks the same distinction in
3597,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"other words. At the beginning, the Poet invites the Muses to tell him"
3598,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"(ver. 487),"
3599,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
3600,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"οἵτινες ἡγεμόνες Δαναῶν καὶ κοίρανοι ἦσαν,"
3601,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
3602,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and at the close he says (ver. 760),"
3603,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
3604,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,οὗτοι ἄρ’ ἡγεμόνες Δαναῶν καὶ κοίρανοι ἦσαν.
3605,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
3606,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,These two verses appear to be in evident correspondence with each
3607,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"other: and if so, we may the more confidently rely on the language"
3608,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"as carefully chosen to describe the two classes, first the kings"
3609,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"as κοίρανοι (cf. Il. ii. 204, 207), and, secondly, the ἀριστῆες as"
3610,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,ἡγεμόνες.
3611,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
3612,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"This class, it is probable, consisted,"
3613,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
3614,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"First, of the leaders of the minor and less significant contingents."
3615,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
3616,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Secondly, of lieutenants, or those who are named in the Catalogue as"
3617,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"holding inferior commands under the great leaders (such as Meriones,"
3618,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Sthenelus, and Euryalus)."
3619,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
3620,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"But, below the ἡγεμόνες of the Catalogue, there would appear to"
3621,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"have been several grades of minor officers, in command of smaller"
3622,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,subdivisions of the army. These would seem to have been described by a
3623,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"general name, ἡγεμόνες. When Nestor (ii. 362) advises the distribution"
3624,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of the army according to φῦλα and φρήτραι, it will, he says, have the"
3625,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"advantage of showing not only which of the soldiers, but which of"
3626,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the officers were good, and which bad. Probably therefore there were"
3627,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"officers of each φῦλον, if not even, under these, of each φρήτρη."
3628,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
3629,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Of the Greeks nine are named in Il. xi. 301-3, who were slain by Hector"
3630,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"at once, before he went among the privates (πληθύς). Of these nine no"
3631,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,one is mentioned in any other part of the poem; and since at the same
3632,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"time they are expressly declared to be ἡγεμόνες, we may safely look"
3633,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,upon them as examples of the class of minor or secondary officers. From
3634,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"their names, which have a strong Hellenic colour[181], we may venture"
3635,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"at least to conjecture, that this class was chiefly Achæan, or of"
3636,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Achæan rank, and that the Pelasgian blood of the army was principally"
3637,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,among the common soldiers.

3641,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"The maritime order of the armament, which required a commander for each"
3642,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"vessel, necessarily involved the existence of a class of what we may"

3650,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Again, when Achilles went with fifty ships to Troy, he divided his 2500"
3651,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"men under five ἡγεμόνες, whom he appointed to give the word of command"
3652,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,(σημαίνειν) under him. The force thus arranged formed five στίχες or
3653,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"ranks, Il. xvi. 168-72: and here the private persons are expressly"
3654,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"called ἑταῖροι (ver. 170). Most probably these ἀγοὶ of the Cretans,"
3655,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and these five Myrmidon leaders, are to be considered as belonging to"
3656,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"a class below the ἀριστῆες, yet above the subalterns."
3657,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
3658,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Lastly, we have to notice the privates, so to speak, of the Greek army,"

3692,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,called παρήορος. The chariot of Hector was drawn by four horses (viii.

3737,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
3738,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,The modes of warfare in the heroic age were very simple: the open

3740,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the men, relieved from time to time by a sprinkling of panics. But"
3741,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"besides the battle, there was another and a more distinguished mode of"

3744,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the Greek character.

3748,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"In that epitome of human life, which Homer has presented to us on the"
3749,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Shield of Achilles, martial operations are of course included. The"
3750,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"collective life of man is represented by two cities, one for peace"
3751,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,and the other for war. Two armies appear beneath the walls of the
3752,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,latter; and one of these takes its post in an ambush[185]. Whenever
3753,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"persons were to be appointed out of an army for this duty, the noblest"
3754,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,and bravest were chosen. Hence Achilles launches the double reproach
3755,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"against Agamemnon, that he has never had spirit enough to arm either"
3756,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"with the soldiery at large for battle, or with the chiefs and prime"
3757,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,warriors for ambuscade[186]. And the reason why the ambuscade stood
3758,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"thus high as the duty and the privilege of the best, is explained in"
3759,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,an admirable speech of Idomeneus. It is simply because it involves a
3760,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"higher trial, through the patience it requires, of moral as opposed to"
3761,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,animal courage.

3823,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,in whose hands the executive power of the state is lodged. This

3996,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,that it could not be more effectually tried than by a recommendation

3998,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"The plan was over-refined; and it may even seem ridiculous, because it"

4049,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,chieftain appears to submit himself to the judgment of Agamemnon in the
4050,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Council[208]. His expressions are perhaps matter more of compliment

4056,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"It was a happy characteristic of heroic Greece, that while she abounded"
4057,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"in true shame, she had no false shame. It was not thought that a king,"
4058,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"who had done wrong, compromised his dignity by atonement; but, on the"
4059,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"contrary, that he recovered it. So says Ulysses, in the Assembly of the"

4071,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Thus then a large liberty of speech and judgment on the part of the

4088,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,The trait which is truly most worthy of note in the polities of
4089,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Homeric Greece, is also that which is so peculiar to them; namely,"
4090,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the substantive weight and influence which belonged to speech as an
4091,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,instrument of government; and of this power by much the most remarkable
4092,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,development is in its less confined and more popular application to the
4093,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Assembly.
4094,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4095,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,This power of speech was essentially a power to be exercised over
4096,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"numbers, and with the safeguards of publicity, by man among his"
4097,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,fellow-men. It was also essentially an instrument addressing itself to
4098,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"reason and free will, and acknowledging their authority. No government"
4099,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"which sought its power in force, as opposed to reason, has at any"
4100,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,time used this form of deception. The world has seen absolutism deck
4101,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"itself with the titles and mere forms of freedom, or seek shelter under"
4102,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,its naked abstractions: but from the exercise of free speech as an
4103,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"instrument of state, it has always shrunk with an instinctive horror."
4104,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4105,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"One mode of proving the power of speech in the heroic age is, by"
4106,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"showing what place it occupied in the thoughts of men, as they are to"
4107,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"be gathered from their language. Another mode is, by pointing to its"
4108,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"connection, in practical examples, with this or that course of action,"
4109,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"adopted or shunned. A third is, by giving evidence of the earnestness"
4110,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"with which the art was prosecuted, and the depth and comprehensiveness"
4111,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,of the conceptions from which it derived its form.

4115,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"For the present, let us endeavour to collect the true sense of Homer"
4116,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"respecting oratory from his language concerning it, from the characters"
4117,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"with whom he has particularly connected it, and from the knowledge"
4118,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,which he may be found to have possessed of its resources.
4119,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4120,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Although it is common to regard the Iliad as a poem having battle for
4121,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"its theme, yet it is in truth not less a monument of policy than of"
4122,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"war; and in this respect it is even more broadly distinguished, than in"
4123,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"most others, from later epics."
4124,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4125,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,The adjectives in Homer are in very many cases the key to his inner
4126,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"mind: and among them all there is none of which this is more true, than"
4127,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the grand epithet κυδιάνειρα. He confines it strictly to two subjects,"
4128,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"battle and debate, the clash of swords and the wrestling of minds. Of"
4129,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Achilles, he says in the First Book[211], (490)"
4130,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4131,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"[211] He uses the epithet for battle in Il. iv. 225, 6. 124, 7. 113, 8."

4137,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"In every other passage where he employs the word, it is attached to the"

4141,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,The intellectual function was no less essential to the warrior-king of
4142,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Homer, than was the martial; and the culture of the art of persuasion"
4143,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"entered no less deeply into his early training. How, says Phœnix to"
4144,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Achilles, shall I leave you, I, whom your father attached to you when"
4145,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"you were a mere child, without knowledge of the evenhanded battle, or"

4160,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Nay, the ἀγορὴ of little Ithaca, where there had been no Assembly for"
4161,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"twenty years, is with Homer the ἀγορὴ πολύφημος[213]. In a description,"
4162,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"if possible yet more striking than that of Phœnix, Homer places before"
4163,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,us the orator at his work. ‘His hearers behold him with delight;
4164,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"he speaks with tempered modesty, yet with confidence in himself"
4165,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"(ἀσφαλέως); he stands preeminent among the assembled people, and while"
4166,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"he passes through the city, they gaze on him as on a god[214]. From a"
4167,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"passage like this we may form some idea, what a real power in human"
4168,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,society was the orator of the heroic age; and we may also learn how and
4169,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"why it was, that the great Bard of that time has also placed himself in"
4170,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the foremost rank of oratory for all time.

4178,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,accomplishments by which human nature is adorned. The three great
4179,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"gifts of the gods to man are, first, corporeal beauty, strength and"

4184,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,but then his comeliness is not crowned by eloquence: ἀλλ’ οὔ οἱ χάρις

4193,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Thersites[216], copious and offensive, to whom we must return. There"
4194,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"is Telemachus, full of the gracious diffidence of youth[217], but"
4195,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,commended by Nestor for a power and a tact of expression beyond his
4196,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"years. There is Menelaus, who speaks with a laconic ease[218]. There"
4197,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"are the Trojan elders, or δημογέροντες, who from their experience and"
4198,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"age chiefly guide the Assembly, and whose volubility and shrill small"

4200,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Then we have Nestor the soft and silvery, whose tones of happy and"
4201,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,benevolent egotism flowed sweeter than a stream of honey[220]. In
4202,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the hands of an inferior artist, Phœnix must have reproduced him;"
4203,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,but an absorbing affection for Achilles is the key-note to all he
4204,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,says; even the account in his speech of his own early adventures is
4205,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,evidently meant as a warning on the effects of rage: this intense
4206,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"earnestness completely prevents any thing like sameness, and thus the"
4207,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"two garrulities stand perfectly distinct from one another, because"

4209,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Ulysses, who, wont to rise with his energies concentrated within him,"
4210,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,gives no promise of display: but when his deep voice issues from
4211,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"his chest, and his mighty words drive like the flakes of snow in"

4225,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4226,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,It is very unusual for Homer to indulge thus largely in careful and
4227,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"detailed description. And even here he has left the one superlative,"
4228,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"as well as other considerable, orators, undescribed. The eloquence of"
4229,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Achilles is left to describe itself; and to challenge comparison with
4230,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"all the choicest patterns both of power and beauty in this kind, that"
4231,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"three thousand years since Homer, and all their ebbing and flowing"
4232,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"tides, have brought within the knowledge of man. Although he modestly"
4233,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"describes himself as beneath Ulysses in this accomplishment, yet in"
4234,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,truth no speeches come near to his. But Homer’s resources are not even
4235,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"now exhausted. The decision of Diomed, the irresolution of Agamemnon,"
4236,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the bluntness of Ajax, are all admirably marked in the series of"
4237,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,speeches allotted to each. Indeed Homer has put into the mouth of
4238,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Idomeneus, whom he nowhere describes as an orator at all, a speech"
4239,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,which is quite enough to establish his reputation in that capacity.

4242,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"In reviewing the arrangements Homer has made, we shall find one feature"
4243,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"alike unequivocal and decisive. The two persons, to whom he has given"
4244,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"supremacy in oratory, are his two, his only two godlike heroes (θεῖοι),"
4245,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the Achilles and the Ulysses, each of whom bears up, like the Atlas of"
4246,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"tradition, the weight of the epic to which he principally belongs."
4247,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4248,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"How could Homer have conceived thoughts like these, if government"
4249,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"in his eyes had rested upon either force or fraud? Moreover, when"
4250,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"he speaks of persuasion and of strength or valour, of the action of"
4251,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the tongue and that of the hand, he clearly does not mean that these"
4252,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,elements are mixed in the ordinary conduct of a sovereign to his
4253,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"subjects: he means the first for peace, the latter for war; the first"
4254,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"to be his sole instrument for governing his own people, the latter for"
4255,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,their enemies alone.
4256,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4257,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"If, again, we endeavour to estimate the importance of Speech in the"
4258,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"heroic age by the degree in which the faculty was actually cultivated,"
4259,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,we must take the achievements of the Poet as the best indicators of
4260,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the capacities of the age. The speeches which Homer has put into the
4261,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,mouths of his leading orators should be tolerably fair representatives
4262,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,of the best performances of the time. Nor is it possible that in any
4263,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"age there should be in a few a capacity for making such speeches,"
4264,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"without a capacity in many for receiving, feeling, and comprehending"
4265,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"them. Poets of modern times have composed great works, in ages that"
4266,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,stopped their ears against them. ‘Paradise Lost’ does not represent the
4267,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"time of Charles the Second, nor the ‘Excursion’ the first decades of"
4268,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the present century. The case of the orator is entirely different. His
4269,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"work, from its very inception, is inextricably mixed up with practice."
4270,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,It is cast in the mould offered to him by the mind of his hearers. It
4271,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,is an influence principally received from his audience (so to speak)
4272,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"in vapour, which he pours back upon them in a flood. The sympathy"
4273,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,and concurrence of his time is with his own mind joint parent of his
4274,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"work. He cannot follow nor frame ideals; his choice is, to be what his"
4275,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"age will have him, what it requires in order to be moved by him, or"
4276,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"else not to be at all. And as when we find the speeches in Homer, we"
4277,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"know that there must have been men who could speak them, so, from the"
4278,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"existence of units who could speak them, we know that there must have"

4299,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"What more admirable example of comprehensive statement, which exhausts"
4300,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the case, and absolutely shuts up the mouth of the adversary, than in"
4301,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the speech of Ulysses to Euryalus, who has reproached him with looking"
4302,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,like a sharper? That speech consists of twenty lines: and I think any
4303,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,one who attempts to give a really accurate summary of it will be apt to
4304,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"find that his epitome, if it be at all complete, has become unawares"
4305,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"a paraphrase. Nor is Homer less successful in showing us, how he has"
4306,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,sounded the depths of pathos. For though the speeches of Priam to
4307,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Achilles in the Twenty-fourth Iliad are spoken privately, and from man"
4308,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"to man only, and are therefore not in the nature of oratory properly so"
4309,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"called, they are conclusive, _a fortiori_, as to his knowledge of the"
4310,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,instruments by which the human affections might be moved so much more
4311,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"easily, when the speaker would be assisted at once by the friendliness"
4312,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,and by the electric sympathies of a multitude.

4314,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,~_Repartee and Sarcasm._~
4315,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4316,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,All these are direct instruments of influence on the mind and actions
4317,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,of man. But of assaults in flank Homer is quite as great a master. He
4318,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,shows a peculiar genius for that which is properly called repartee; for
4319,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"that form of speech, which flings back upon the opponent the stroke of"
4320,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"his own weapon, or on the supplicant the plea of his own prayer. There"
4321,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"was one Antimachus, a Trojan, who had grown wealthy, probably by the"
4322,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,bribes which he received from Paris in consideration of his always
4323,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"opposing, in the Trojan Agorè, the restoration of Helen to the Greeks."
4324,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,His sons are mastered by Agamemnon in the field. Aware that he had a
4325,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"thirst for money, they cry, ‘Quarter, Agamemnon! we are the sons of"
4326,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"rich Antimachus: _he_ will pay well for our lives.’ ‘If,’ replies the"
4327,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"king, ‘you are the sons of that Antimachus, who, when Menelaus came"
4328,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"as envoy to Troy, advised to take and slay him, here and now shall ye"
4329,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,expiate your father’s infamy[222].’ Compare with this the yet sharper
4330,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"turn of Ulysses on Leiodes in the Odyssey: ‘Spare me, Ulysses! I have"
4331,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,done no ill in your halls; I stopped what ill I could; I was but Augur
4332,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,to the Suitors.’ Then follows the stern reply. ‘If thou dost avow that
4333,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"thou art Augur to the Suitors, then often in prayer must thou have"
4334,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"augured my destruction, and desired my wife for thine own; wherefore"
4335,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,thou shalt not escape the painsome bed of death[223].’

4341,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"But the weapons of sarcasm, from the lightest to the weightiest, are"
4342,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,wielded by Homer with almost greater effect than any others. As a
4343,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"sample of the former, I take the speech of Phœnix when he introduces,"
4344,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"by way of parable, the Legend of Meleager. ‘As long as Meleager fought,"
4345,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,all was well; but when rage took possession of him--which (I would just
4346,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"observe) now and then bewilders other great minds also--then,’ and so"
4347,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,onward.
4348,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4349,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"But for the great master of this art, Homer has chosen Achilles. As"
4350,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"with his invectives he grinds to powder, so with the razor edge of"
4351,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the most refined irony he cuts his way in a moment to the quick. When
4352,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Greece, in the person of the envoy-kings, is at his feet, and he has"
4353,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"spurned them away, he says, ‘No: I will go home: you can come and see"

4416,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"If the power of oratory is remarkable in Homer, so likewise is the"
4417,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,faculty of what in England is called debate. Here the orator is a
4418,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"wrestler, holding his ground from moment to moment; adjusting his"
4419,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"poise, and delivering his force, in exact proportion to the varying"
4420,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"pressure of his antagonist. In Homer’s debates, every speech after"
4421,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the first is commonly a reply. It belongs not only to the subject,"
4422,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"but to the speech that went before: it exhibits, given the question"
4423,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and the aims of the speaker, the exact degree of ascent or descent,"
4424,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of expansion or contraction, of relaxation or enhancement, which"
4425,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the circumstances of the case, in the state up to which they were"
4426,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"brought by the preceding address, may require. In the Assembly of"
4427,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the First Book, five, nay, six, successive speeches of Achilles and"
4428,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Agamemnon[226] bring their great contention to its climax. But the
4429,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,discussion with the Envoys deserves very particular notice. Ulysses
4430,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,begins a skilled harangue to the offended hero with a most artful
4431,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,and well-masked exaggeration of the martial fury of Hector. He takes
4432,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"care only to present it as part of a general picture, which in other"
4433,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,parts is true enough; but he obviously relies upon it as a mode of
4434,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,getting within the guard of Achilles. He next touches him upon the
4435,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"point, to which Priam afterwards made a yet higher appeal; the tender"
4436,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"recollection of his father Peleus, who had warned him how much more"
4437,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"arduous was the acquisition of self-command, than that of daring."
4438,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"He then recites the gifts of Agamemnon: and, encouraged perhaps by"
4439,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the kind greeting that, with his companions, he had received, he"
4440,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"closes by urging that, however hateful Agamemnon may be, yet, in"
4441,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"pity for the other Greeks, both high and low, and in anticipation"
4442,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of their gratitude, he ought to arm. I shall not attempt to analyse"
4443,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the wonderful speech of Achilles which follows, and to which some"
4444,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"references have already been made. Suffice it to say, that it commences"
4445,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"with an intimation to Ulysses that it will, in the opinion of the"
4446,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"speaker, be best for all parties if he tells out his mind plainly: an"
4447,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,indirect and courteous reproof to Ulysses for having thought to act
4448,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,upon him by tact and by the processes of a rhetorician. After this
4449,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"follows such a combination of argument, declamation, invective, and"
4450,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"sarcasm as, within the same compass, I do not believe all the records"
4451,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,of the world can match. But the general result of the whole is the
4452,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,announcement that he will return to Phthia the very next morning;
4453,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"together with an absolute, unconditional rejection of all gifts and"
4454,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"proffers, until the outrage of Agamemnon is entirely wiped away[227]:"

4461,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4462,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"When he has concluded, all his hearers, abashed by his masculine wrath,"
4463,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"are silent for a while. Then Phœnix, in the longest speech of the"
4464,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"poem, pours forth his unselfish and warm, but prolix and digressive"
4465,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"affection. This speech displays far less of rhetorical resource,"
4466,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"than that of Ulysses. Ulysses had conceded, as it were, the right of"
4467,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Achilles to an unbounded resentment against Agamemnon (300): Phœnix, on"
4468,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the contrary, by parable, menaces him with retribution from the Erinūs,"
4469,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"unless he shall subdue the mighty soul within him. But Achilles,"
4470,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"touched in his better nature, gives way a little to the more ethical"
4471,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"appeal, where he had been inflexible and invulnerable before the"
4472,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"intellectual and rhetorical address. He now bids Phœnix come himself,"
4473,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and sleep in his encampment: there they can consider together, in the"
4474,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"morning, whether to go or to stay (618). Still he announces, that"
4475,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,nothing will induce him to quit the ships for the field (609). Next
4476,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,comes blunt Ajax into the _palæstra_; deprecates the wasting of time;
4477,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"is for taking back the answer, bad as it may be: Achilles has evidently"
4478,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"made up his mind; and cares not a rush for all or any of them. ‘What,’"
4479,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"says the simple man-mountain, ‘the homicide of a brother or child is"
4480,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"atoned for by a fine, and yet here is all this to-do about a girl. Aye,"
4481,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and a single girl; when we offer seven of the very best, and ever so"
4482,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"much besides.’ Having thus reached the _acmè_ of his arts, he now aims"
4483,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"at the friendly feeling of Achilles, and in a single word bids him be"
4484,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"placable to men whom he has admitted beneath his roof, and whom he owns"
4485,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,for as loyal friends as the whole army could find him.
4486,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4487,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"The leverage of this straightforward speech, which is only saved by"
4488,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"kindliness from falling into rudeness, again produces an initial"
4489,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,movement towards concession on the part of the great hero. He replies
4490,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"in effect to Ajax, ‘You have spoken well: I like your way of going"
4491,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,to work: but my heart swells and boils with the shame inflicted on
4492,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,me before the Greeks by Agamemnon. Tell them then’--there is now no
4493,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"announcement of setting sail; nay, there is no longer any need for"
4494,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,debate in the morning whether to set sail or not--‘tell them that I
4495,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"fight no more, till Hector, carrying slaughter and fire, shall reach"
4496,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"this camp, these ships. Keen as he may be, it will then be time enough"
4497,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,for ME to stay his onward path.’
4498,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4499,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Such is the remarkable course of this debate. But Ulysses, when they"
4500,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,return to Agamemnon--meaning probably to bring him and all the Greeks
4501,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,fairly to bay--takes no notice of the partial relaxations of the iron
4502,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"will of Achilles, but simply reports that he has threatened to set"
4503,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,sail. Then comes the turn of Diomed. ‘You were wrong to cringe to him.
4504,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Of himself, he is arrogant enough: you have made him worse. Let him"
4505,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"alone; he will come when he thinks proper, or when Providence wills it;"
4506,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and no sooner. My advice is that we sleep and eat now, and fight at"
4507,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"dawn. I, at any rate, will be there, in the foremost of the battle.’"

4509,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,~_Function of the Assembly._~
4510,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4511,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,We will now proceed to consider the nature and place of the ἀγορὴ or
4512,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Assembly, in the heroic age: and a view of the proceedings on several"
4513,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,occasions will further illustrate the great and diversified oratorical
4514,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,resources of the Poet.
4515,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4516,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"A people cannot live in its corporate capacity without intermission,"
4517,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,and the king is the standing representative of the community. But yet
4518,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the ἀγορὴ, or Assembly, is the true centre of its life and its vital"
4519,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"motion, as the monarch is of its functional or administrative activity;"
4520,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and the greatest ultimate power, which the king possesses, is that"
4521,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of influence upon his subjects collected there, through the combined"
4522,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"medium of their reverence for his person, and of his own powers of"
4523,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"persuasion. In the case of the army before Troy, to the strength"
4524,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of these ordinary motives is added, along with a certain spirit of"
4525,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"resentment for injury received in the person of Helen, the hope of"
4526,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"a rich booty on the capture of the city, and the principle of pure"
4527,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"military honour; never perhaps more powerfully drawn than in the Iliad,"
4528,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"nor with greater freedom from extravagances, by which it is sometimes"
4529,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"made to ride over the heads of duty and justice, its only lawful"
4530,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,superiors.
4531,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4532,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"First, it would appear to have belonged to the Assembly, not indeed to"
4533,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"distribute the spoil, but to consent to its distribution by the chief"
4534,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"commander, and his brother-leaders. To the former it is imputed in the"
4535,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Ninth Book. But in the First Book Achilles says to him in the Assembly,"
4536,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"We the Greeks (Ἀχαιοὶ) will requite you three and four-fold, when Troy"
4537,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,is taken[228]. It is probable that he here means to speak of the chiefs
4538,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"alone, (but only so far as the act of distribution is concerned,)"
4539,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,because Thersites uses the very same expression (ἅς τοι Ἀχαιοὶ πρωτίστῳ
4540,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,δίδομεν[229]) in the Second Book. Therefore the division of booty was
4541,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"probably made on the king’s proposal, with the aid of the chiefs, but"
4542,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"with the general knowledge and consent of the army, and in right of"
4543,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,that consent on their part.

4553,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"several extremes by the consequences of long strife, greedy appetite,"
4554,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and furious passions, excited by the temptations which the accumulation"

4559,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"there was no formal distribution of political rights, as if they could"
4560,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,be made the object of ambitious or contentious cupidity: but the grand
4561,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,social power that moved the machine was in the determinations of the

4563,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4564,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Grote has observed, that in the Homeric ἀγορὴ no division of"
4565,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,affirmative and negative voices ever takes place. It would require
4566,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,a volume to discuss all that this remark involves and indicates. I
4567,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,will however observe that the principle surely cannot be made good
4568,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"from history or in philosophy, that numbers prevail by an inherent"
4569,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"right. Decision by majorities is as much an expedient, as lighting by"
4570,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"gas. In adopting it as a rule, we are not realizing perfection, but"
4571,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"bowing to imperfection. We follow it as best for us, not as best in"
4572,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"itself. The only _right_ to command, as Burke has said, resides in"
4573,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"wisdom and virtue. In their application to human affairs, these great"
4574,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"powers have commonly been qualified, on the one hand by tradition and"
4575,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"prepossession, on the other hand by force. Decision by majorities has"
4576,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the great merit of avoiding, and that by a test perfectly definite,"
4577,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the last resort to violence; and of making force itself the servant
4578,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,instead of the master of authority. But our country still rejoices in
4579,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the belief, that she does not decide all things by majorities. The"
4580,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"first Greeks neither knew the use of this numerical dogma, nor the"
4581,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"abuse of it. They did not employ it as an instrument, and in that they"
4582,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"lost: but they did not worship it as an idol, and in that they greatly"
4583,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,gained. Votes were not polled in the Olympus of Homer; yet a minority
4584,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,of influential gods carry the day in favour of the Greeks against the
4585,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"majority, and against their Head. There surely could not be a grosser"
4586,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"error than to deny every power to be a real one, unless we are able"
4587,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"both to measure its results in a table of statistics, and to trace at"
4588,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"every step, with our weak and partial vision, the precise mode by which"
4589,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,it works towards its end.
4590,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4591,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,~_Great decisions all taken there._~
4592,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4593,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"We have seen, in the first place, that all the great decisions of"
4594,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the War were taken in the Assembly of the Greeks. And here the first
4595,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"reflection that arises is, how deeply this method of political action"
4596,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"must have been engrained in their habits and ideas, when it could"
4597,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"survive the transition from peace to war, and, notwithstanding its"
4598,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"palpable inconveniences in a camp, form the practical rule of its"
4599,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,proceedings under the eye of the enemy.
4600,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4601,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,The force of this consideration is raised to the utmost height by the
4602,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"case of the Night Assembly in the Ninth Book. The Trojans, no longer"
4603,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"confined to their walls, are lying beside a thousand watch-fires, just"
4604,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,outside the rampart. Some important measure is absolutely demanded on
4605,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the instant by the downcast condition of the less than half-beaten,"
4606,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,but still thoroughly discouraged army. Yet not even under these
4607,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"circumstances would Agamemnon act individually, or with the kings"
4608,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"alone. He sends his heralds round the camp (Il. ix. 11),"
4609,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4610,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"κλήδην εἰς ἀγορὴν κικλήσκειν ἄνδρα ἕκαστον,"
4611,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,μηδὲ βοᾶν·
4612,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4613,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"to summon an Assembly noiselessly, and man by man. Can there be a more"
4614,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"conclusive proof of the vigour, with which the popular principle"
4615,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,entered into the idea of the Homeric polities? If it be said that
4616,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"such an operation could hardly be effected at night without stir, I"
4617,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"reply that if it be so, the argument for the power and vitality of the"
4618,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Assembly is but strengthened: for Homer was evidently far more careful
4619,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,to speak in harmony with the political tone of his country than to
4620,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"measure out time by the hour and minute, or place by the yard, foot,"
4621,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and inch; as valuing not the latter methods less, but the former more."
4622,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4623,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"The Greek army, in fact, is neither more nor less than, so to speak,"
4624,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the State in uniform. As the soldier of those days was simply the
4625,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"citizen armed, so the armament was the aggregate of armed citizens,"
4626,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"who, in all except their arms and the handling of them, continued to"
4627,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,be what they had been before. But when we find that in such great
4628,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"emergencies political ideas did not give way to military expediency, we"
4629,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"cannot, I think, but conclude that those ideas rested on broad and deep"
4630,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,foundations.
4631,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4632,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,It further tends to show the free nature of the relation between the
4633,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Assembly and the Commander-in-chief, that it might be summoned by"
4634,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"others, as well as by him. We are told explicitly in the First Book,"
4635,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"that Achilles called it together, as he did again in the Nineteenth"
4636,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"for the Reconciliation. On the second of these occasions, it may"
4637,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,have been his purpose that the reparation should be as public as had
4638,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,been the insult: at any rate there was a determination to make the
4639,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"reconciliation final, absolute, and thorough. But, at the former"
4640,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"time, the act partook of the nature of a moral appeal from Agamemnon"
4641,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"to the army. It illustrated, in the first place, the principle of"
4642,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,publicity so prevalent in the Greek polities. That which Calchas had
4643,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"to declare, he must declare not in a ‘hole and corner,’ but on his"
4644,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"responsibility, liable to challenge, subject to the δήμου φάτις if he"
4645,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"told less than the truth, as well as to the resentment of the sovereign"
4646,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"if he should venture on divulging it entire. But secondly, it shows"
4647,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,that Achilles held the Greeks at large entitled and bound to be parties
4648,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,to the transaction. He meant that the Greeks should see his wrong.
4649,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Perhaps he hoped that they would intercept its infliction. This at
4650,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,any rate is clear: he commenced the debate with measured reproofs of
4651,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Agamemnon[230]; but afterwards he rose, with a wider scope, to a more"
4652,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,intense and a bitterer strain[231].

4658,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"When he found that the monarch was determined, and when he had"
4659,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"repressed the access of rage which tempted him to summary revenge, he"
4660,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"began to use language not now of mere invective against Agamemnon, but"
4661,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,of such invective as tended to set him at odds with the people. Then
4662,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"further on, perhaps because they did not echo back his sentiments,"
4663,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and become active parties to the terrible fray, he both taunts and"
4664,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"threatens them. For he begins[232], ‘Coward that thou art! Never"
4665,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"hast thou dared to arm with the people for the fight, or with the"
4666,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,leaders for the ambush.’ And then[233]. ‘Devourer of the people! over
4667,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,what nobodies thou rulest! or surely this would be the last of your
4668,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"misdeeds.’ Again, in the peroration[234], ‘By this mighty oath, every"

4679,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,It has often been asserted that the principle of popular opposition
4680,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,in debate is only represented by Thersites. But let us proceed step
4681,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,by step. It is at any rate clear enough that opposition by the
4682,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,confederate kings is at once sufficiently represented in Achilles; and
4683,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"that it is not represented by him alone, since in the Assembly of the"
4684,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Ninth Book, Diomed both strongly reprehended Agamemnon, and proposes"
4685,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,a course diametrically the reverse of his; which course was forthwith
4686,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,adopted by the acclamations of the army.
4687,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4688,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,~_The case of Thersites._~
4689,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4690,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Let us now pass on to Thersites. There is no more singular picture
4691,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"in the Iliad, than that which he presents to us. It well deserves"
4692,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,examination in detail.
4693,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4694,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Homer has evidently been at pains to concentrate upon this personage
4695,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"all that could make him odious to the hearers of his song, while"
4696,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"nevertheless he puts into his mouth not only the cant of patriotism,"
4697,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"but also a case that would perhaps have been popular, had he not"
4698,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,averted the favour of the army by his insolent vulgarity.
4699,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4700,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Upon its merits, too, it was a tolerable case, but not a good one;"
4701,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,for he was wrong in supposing Achilles placable; and again wrong in
4702,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"advising that the Greeks, now without Achilles, should give way before"
4703,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the Trojans, to whom they were still superior in war."
4704,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4705,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"He is in all things the reverse of the great human ideals of Homer. As,"
4706,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"in the pattern kings and heroes, moral, intellectual, and corporeal"
4707,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"excellences, each in the highest degree, must be combined, so Thersites"
4708,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,presents a corresponding complication of deformities to view. As to
4709,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the first, he is the most infamous person (αἴσχιστος) in the army;"
4710,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and he relies for his influence, not on the sense and honour of the"
4711,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"soldiers, but on a vein of gross buffoonery; which he displays in the"
4712,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,only coarse allusion that is to be found in all the speeches of the
4713,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"poems. As to the second head, his voluble speech is as void of order"
4714,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"as of decency[235]. As to the third, he is lame, bandy-legged[236],"
4715,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"hump-backed, round-shouldered, peak-headed, and lastly, (among the"
4716,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"καρηκομόωντες,) he is bald, or indeed worse, for on his head a hair is"
4717,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"planted here and there[237]. Lastly, hateful to all[238], he is most of"
4718,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"all hateful to, as well as spiteful against, the two paramount heroes"
4719,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of the poems, Achilles and Ulysses: an observation inserted with equal"
4720,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"ingenuity and significance, because Homer, by inserting it, effectually"
4721,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,cuts off any favour which Thersites might otherwise have gained with
4722,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,his hearers from seeming to take the side of the wronged Achilles. It
4723,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"is also worthy of note, as indicating how Homer felt the strength of"
4724,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,that bond which unites together all great excellences of whatever kind.
4725,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Upon a slight and exterior view, the two great characters of Achilles"
4726,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and Ulysses appear antagonistic, and we might expect to find their"
4727,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"likes and dislikes running in opposite directions. But as, in the Ninth"
4728,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Book, Ulysses is declared by Achilles to be one of those whom he loves"
4729,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"best among the Greeks[239], so here they are united in carrying to the"
4730,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,highest degree a common antipathy to Thersites.

4743,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,While depriving the wretch of all qualities that could attract towards
4744,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"him the slightest share of sympathy, Homer has taken care to leave"
4745,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Thersites in full possession of every thing that was necessary for his
4746,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"trade; an ample flow of speech (213), and no small power of vulgar"
4747,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,invective (215).
4748,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4749,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Again, the quality of mere scurrility assigned to Thersites, and well"
4750,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"exemplified in his speech, stands alike distinguished in Homer from the"
4751,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"vein of fun, which he can open in the grave Ulysses of the Odyssey,"
4752,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,even while he is under terror of the Cyclops; and from that tremendous
4753,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and perhaps still unrivalled power of sarcasm, of which we have found"
4754,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the climax in Achilles.
4755,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4756,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"In the short speech of Thersites, Homer has contrived to exhibit"
4757,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"striking examples of malice (vv. 226, 234), coarseness (232), vanity"
4758,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"(vv. 228, 231, 238), cowardice (236); while it is a tissue of"
4759,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,consummate impudence throughout. Of this we find the finest stroke at
4760,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the end of it, where he says[240],"
4761,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4762,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,[240] In 237 he appears to follow what Achilles had said i. 170.

4768,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4769,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"For here the wretch apes Achilles, whom (for the sake of damaging"
4770,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Agamemnon) he affects to patronize, and, over and above the pretension"
4771,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,to speak of his feelings as if he had been taken into his confidence on
4772,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the occasion, he actually closes with the very line which Achilles, at"
4773,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the moment of high passion, had used in the Assembly of the First Book"
4774,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,(i. 232).
4775,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4776,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"If we consider the selection of topics each by themselves, with"
4777,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"reference to effect, the speech is not without a certain εὐστοχία: he"
4778,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,hits the avarice of Agamemnon hard (226); and his responsibility as
4779,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,a ruler (234): while pretending to incite the courage of the Greeks
4780,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"(235), he flatters their home-sickness and faint-heartedness by"
4781,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"counselling the return (236); and, in supporting Achilles, he plausibly"
4782,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,reckons on being found to have taken the popular side. But if we
4783,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"regard it, as every speech should be regarded, with reference to some"
4784,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"paramount purpose, it is really senseless and inconsequent. Dwelling as"
4785,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"he does upon the wrong done to Achilles, and asserting the placability"
4786,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of that chieftain, he ought to have ended with recommending an attempt"
4787,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,to compensate and appease him; instead of which he recommends the
4788,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Return, which had been just abandoned. But the real extravagance of"
4789,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the speech comes out only in connection with his self-love; when, like"
4790,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"many better men, he wholly loses whatever sense of the ridiculous he"
4791,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,might possess. It is not only ‘the women whom we give you’ (227); ‘the
4792,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"service which we render you’ (238), but it is also ‘the gold[242] that"
4793,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"some Trojan may bring to ransom his son, whom I, or else some other"
4794,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Greek, may have led captive.’ I, Thersites, or some other Greek! The"
4795,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"only Greek, of whom we hear in the Iliad as having made and sold on"
4796,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"ransom captives during the war, is Achilles[243]; and it is with him"
4797,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"that Thersites thus couples himself. Upon this, Ulysses, perceiving"
4798,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,that he stands in opposition to the prevailing sentiment of the
4799,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Assembly, silences him by a judicious application of the sceptre to his"
4800,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"back and shoulders: yet not even Thersites does he silence by force,"

4811,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"presumptuous critic, though his virulent reproaches were substantially"

4840,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,and Homer has separated widely between this individual and the mass
4841,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of the army, by informing us that in the general opinion Ulysses had"
4842,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"rendered a service, even greater than any of his former ones, by"
4843,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,putting down Thersites. ‘Ulysses has done a thousand good things in
4844,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"council and in war: but this is the best of all, that he has stopped"
4845,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the scoundrel in his ribaldry[249].’

4848,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4849,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Thersites spoke not against Agamemnon only, but against the sense of"
4850,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the whole army (212); and the ground of the proceeding of Ulysses is
4851,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"not laid in the fact of his having resisted Agamemnon, or Agamemnon"
4852,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"with the whole body of the kings; but in the manner of his speech, and"
4853,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,in his having acted alone and against the general sentiment. Above
4854,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"all, we must recollect the circumstances, under which Ulysses ventured"
4855,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,to chastise even this rancorous and foul-mouthed railer. It was at a
4856,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"moment of crisis, nay, of agony. The rush from the Assembly to the"
4857,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"ships did not follow upon an orderly assent to a proposal, such as was"
4858,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"generally given; but it resulted from a tumultuous impulse, like that"
4859,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of blasts tossing the sea, or sweeping down upon the cornfield (Il."
4860,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,ii. 144-54). If therefore Ulysses employs the sceptre of Agamemnon to
4861,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"smite those who were shouting in aid of this ruinous tumult (ii. 198),"
4862,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,we need not take this for a sample of what would be done in ordinary
4863,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"circumstances, more than the fate of Wat Tyler for a type of British"
4864,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"freedom under the Plantagenets. Odious too as was Thersites, yet the"
4865,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"army, amidst a preponderating sentiment of approval, still appear to"
4866,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,have felt some regret at his mishap[250];

4872,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"for the first words would suggest, that they knew how to value the"
4873,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"liberty of thought, which had been abused, disgraced, and consequently"
4874,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"restrained, in his person. Surely it would be most precipitate to"
4875,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"conclude, from a case like this, that the debates of the Assemblies"
4876,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"were formal, and that they had nothing to do but to listen to a sham"
4877,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"discussion, and to register or follow decrees which were substantially"
4878,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,those of Agamemnon only.
4879,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4880,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,I believe that the mistake involved in the judgment we have been
4881,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,canvassing is a double one: a mistake of the relation of Agamemnon
4882,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,to the other kings and chiefs; and a mistake of the relation of the
4883,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,sovereigns generally to their subjects. Agamemnon was strong in
4884,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"influence and authority, but he had, as we have already seen, nothing"
4885,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,like a despotic control over the other kings. The kings were strong
4886,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"in personal ability, in high descent, in the sanction of Jupiter, in"
4887,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"possession, and in tradition: but all their strength, great as it was,"
4888,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"lay as a general rule in the direction of influence, and not in that of"
4889,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,violence.
4890,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4891,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"I do not think, however, that we ought to be contented with the merely"
4892,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,negative mode of treatment for the case of Thersites. I cannot but
4893,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"conceive that, upon an impartial review, it may teach more, than is"
4894,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,drawn from it by merely saying that it does not prove the Assembly to
4895,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"have been an illusion. We must assume that Homer’s picture, if not"
4896,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"historical, at least conformed to the laws of probability. Now, what is"
4897,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the picture? That the buffoon of the army, wholly without influence,"
4898,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"capable of attracting no respect, when the mass of the people had"
4899,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"overcome their homeward impulse, had returned to the Assembly, and"
4900,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"were awaiting the proposition of the kings, first continues to rail"
4901,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"(ἐκολῴα) while every one else is silent, and then takes upon himself"
4902,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the initiative in recommending the resumption of the project, which"
4903,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,they had that moment abandoned. If such conduct could be ascribed by
4904,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the Poet to a creature sharp-witted enough, and as careful as others of"
4905,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"his own back, does not the very fact presuppose that freedom of debate"

4925,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"they kept it within bounds, or rather that, when the proper time"

4931,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Now of the cheering of the people I venture to say, not that it"
4932,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"raises a presumption of, but that it actually constitutes, their"
4933,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"interference. The rule of every tolerably regulated assembly, charged"
4934,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"with the conduct of important matters, is to permit no expressions of"
4935,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"approval or otherwise during the proceedings, except from the parties"
4936,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,immediately belonging to the body. The total exclusion of applause in
4937,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,judicial cases belongs to a state of mind and manners different from
4938,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,that of the heroic age. But the exclusion of all applause by mere
4939,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,strangers to the business rests upon a truth common to every age;
4940,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"namely, that such applause constitutes a share in the business, and"
4941,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,contributes to the decision. It will be remembered how the cries of the
4942,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Galleries became one of the grievous scandals of the first revolution
4943,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"in France, and how largely they affected the determinations of the"
4944,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,National Assembly. The irregular use of such a power is a formidable
4945,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,invasion of legislative or judicial freedom: the allowed possession of
4946,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the privilege amounts to participation in the office of the statesman
4947,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"or the judge, and demonstrates the substantive position of the λαὸς, or"
4948,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"people, in the Assemblies of the heroic age."
4949,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4950,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,But apparently their function was not completed by merely encouraging
4951,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the litigant, with whom each man might chance to sympathize. For we are"
4952,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"told not only that the Judges, that is to say, the γέροντες, delivered"
4953,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"their opinions consecutively, but likewise that there lay in the sight"
4954,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of all two golden talents, to be given to him who should pronounce the"
4955,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,fairest judgment (xviii. 508);
4956,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4957,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"τῷ δόμεν, ὃς μετὰ τοῖσι δίκην ἰθύντατα εἴποι."
4958,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
4959,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Thus it is plain that the judge who might do best was to get the
4960,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,two talents: but who was to give them? Not the γέροντες or elders
4961,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"themselves, surely; for among them the competition lay. There could"
4962,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,be but one way in which the disposal of this fee could be settled:
4963,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"namely, by the general acclamation of the people, to be expressed,"
4964,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"after hearing the respective parties, in favour of him whose sentiments"
4965,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"they most approved. And those, to whom it may seem strange to speak of"
4966,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"vote by acclamation, should remember, that down to this day, in all"
4967,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"deliberative assemblies, an overpowering proportion of the votes are"
4968,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"votes by acclamation, or by the still less definite test of silence."
4969,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"The small minority of instances, when a difference of opinion is"
4970,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"seriously pressed, are now settled by arithmetic; they would then have"
4971,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"been adjusted by some prudent appeal to the general will, proceeding"
4972,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"from a person of ability and weight. Indeed even now, in cases when"
4973,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the numbers approximate to those of the Greek army, there can be"
4974,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"no _bonâ fide_ decision by arithmetic. The demand, however, that"
4975,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"dissension shall be the only allowed criterion of liberty, is one which"
4976,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,really worsens the condition of human nature beyond what the truth of

4982,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"himself? Idæus[252], the Trojan herald, arrives with the offer to"
4983,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"restore the stolen property, but not Helen. He is received in dead"
4984,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"silence. After a pause, Diomed gives utterance to the general feeling."
4985,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"‘Neither will we have the goods without Helen, nor yet Helen with the"

4988,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"sense of the Achæans, how they answer you; and I think with them.’ At"
4989,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the least this is a declaration as express as words can make it, and"
4990,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"proceeding out of the mouth of the rival authority, to the effect that"
4991,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the acclamation of the Assembly was, for all practical purposes, its"
4992,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"vote, and that it required only concurrence from the king, to invest it"

5002,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"army, as a sample of what would have happened to the people, or even"
5003,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"a part of them, when differing in judgment from their king. But what"
5004,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"shall we say to the argument, that no case is found where a person"
5005,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,of humble condition takes part in the debates of the Assemblies? No
5006,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,doubt the conduct of debates was virtually in the hands of those whose
5007,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"birth, wealth, station, and habits of life gave them capacity for"
5008,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"public affairs. Even in the nineteenth century, it very rarely happens"
5009,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,that a working man takes part in the proceedings of a county meeting:
5010,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,but no one would on that account suppose that such an assembly can be
5011,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"used as the mere tool of the class who conduct the debate, far less of"
5012,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,any individual prominent in that class. If we cannot conceive freedom
5013,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"without perpetual discord, the faithful performance of the duty of"
5014,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"information and advice without coercion and oppression, it is a sign"
5015,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"either of our narrow-mindedness, or of our political degeneracy; but"
5016,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,a feeble eye does not impair the reality of the object on which it may

5018,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
5019,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Still we may admit that among the numerous assemblies of the Iliad,"
5020,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"there is no instance where assent is given by one part of the Assembly,"
5021,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and withheld by the other. There is, as we have seen, a clear and"
5022,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"strong case where the opinion of the commander-in-chief is rejected,"
5023,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,and that of an inferior commander adopted in its stead. This in my
5024,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,opinion goes far to prove all that is necessary. We have from the
5025,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Odyssey, however, the means of going further still."
5026,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
5027,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Only, before leaving the Iliad, let us observe the terms in which the"
5028,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Greek Assemblies are addressed by the kings: they are denominated
5029,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,friends and heroes; names which at least appear to imply their title
5030,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"to judge, or freely to concur, at least as much as such a title was"
5031,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,recognised in the ancient councils and assemblies of the Anglo-saxons.
5032,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Was this appearance a mockery? I do not say we should compare it with
5033,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the organized, secure and regular privileges of a few nations in modern"
5034,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,days. But it would be a far greater mistake to treat it as an idle

5039,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,From what is related in that poem to have occurred after the capture
5040,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of Troy, it becomes abundantly clear that the function of the Greek"
5041,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Assembly was not confined to listening. The army met in what, for the"
5042,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"sake of distinction, we may call the Drunken Assembly[254]. Now, the"
5043,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,influence of wine upon its proceedings is amply sufficient to show that
5044,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,its acts were the acts of the people: for Homer never allows his chiefs
5045,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,to be moved from their self-possession by the power of liquor.

5047,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,[254] Od. iii. 139.
5048,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
5049,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,There was a marked difference of opinion on that occasion: the people
5050,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,took their sides; δίχα δέ σφισιν ἥνδανε βουλή (Od. iii. 150). One
5051,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,half embarked; the residue staid behind with Agamemnon (155-7). The
5052,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"moiety, which had sailed away, split again (162); and a portion of"
5053,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"them went back to Agamemnon. We see, indeed, throughout the Odyssey,"
5054,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"how freely the crews of Ulysses spoke or acted, when they thought fit,"
5055,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"in opposition to his views. If it be said, we must not argue from the"
5056,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"unruly speeches of men in great straits at sea, the answer is, first,"
5057,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,that their necessities might rather tend to induce their acquiescence
5058,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"in a stricter discipline; and secondly, that their liberty, and even"
5059,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"license, are not out of keeping with the general tone of the relations"
5060,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"between freemen of different classes, as exhibited to us elsewhere in"
5061,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the Homeric poems.
5062,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
5063,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"It may, indeed, be said, that the divisions of the Greeks in the final"
5064,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"proceedings at Troy were divisions, not of the men, but of the chiefs."
5065,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"This, however, upon the face of the text, is very doubtful. We see from"
5066,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the tale of the Pseudo-Ulysses, in the Thirteenth Odyssey (265, 6),"
5067,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,that there were parties and separate action in the Greek contingents:
5068,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and it is probably to these that Nestor may allude, when he recommends"
5069,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the Review in order that the responsibility of the officers may be
5070,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"brought home to them individually. Now, in the case before us, the"
5071,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,first division is thus described. Menelaus exhorted all the Greeks
5072,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"(πάντας Ἀχαιοὺς) to go home: Agamemnon disagreed (141, 3): while they"
5073,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"were contesting the point, the Assembly rose in two parties (vv. 149,"
5074,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,50);
5075,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
5076,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,οἱ δ’ ἀνόρουσαν ἐϋκνήμιδες Ἀχαιοὶ
5077,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,ἠχῇ θεσπεσίῃ· δίχα δέ σφισιν ἥνδανε βουλή.
5078,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
5079,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,There is no intimation here that the people in dividing simply
5080,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"followed their chiefs. Nay, the tone of the description is such as"
5081,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"obliges us to understand that the movement was a popular one, and took"
5082,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"its rise from the debate: so that, even if the chiefs and their men"
5083,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"kept together respectively, as they may have done, still the chiefs"
5084,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"may probably have followed quite as much as they led. Again, when the"
5085,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"second separation takes place, it is thus described, ‘One portion"
5086,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"returned, under Ulysses, to Agamemnon. Prognosticating evil, I made"
5087,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"sail homewards with the whole body of my ships, which followed me."
5088,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Diomed did the same, and (ὦρσε δ’ ἑταίρους) invited his men (to do it)."
5089,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,And after us at last came Menelaus.’ (vv. 162-8). Now here instruction
5090,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,is given us on three points:
5091,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
5092,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,1. Diomed urged his men; therefore it was not a mere matter of course
5093,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,that they should go.
5094,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
5095,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,2. Nestor mentions especially that his division all kept together (σὺν
5096,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,νηυσὶν ἀολλέσιν); therefore this did not always happen.
5097,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
5098,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"3. It is very unlikely that the part, which is first named as having"
5099,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"returned with Ulysses, should have been confined to his own petty"
5100,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,contingent.
5101,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
5102,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Thus it is left in great doubt, whether the chiefs and men did"
5103,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,uniformly keep together: and the tenour of the narrative favours the
5104,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"supposition, that the men at least contributed materially to any joint"

5111,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Agamemnon, so, in that of the Odyssey, Telemachus does the like"
5112,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,with reference to the Suitors. It is there that he protests against
5113,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,their continued consumption of his substance; that he rejects their
5114,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"counter-proposal for the dismissal of his mother on their behalf, and"
5115,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,that he himself finally propounds the voyage to the mainland[255].
5116,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"There too we find a most distinct recognition by Mentor, his guardian,"
5117,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,of the powers and rights of the people; for he loudly complains of
5118,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"their sitting silent, numerous as they are[256], instead of interposing"
5119,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"to rebuke the handful of Suitors that were the wrongdoers. But if,"
5120,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"according to the genius and usages of the heroic age, the people had"
5121,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"nothing to do but to listen and obey their betters, the expectation"
5122,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,that they should have risen to defend a minor against the associated
5123,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"aristocracy of the country would have been absurd, and could not have"
5124,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"been expressed, as we find it expressed, by Mentor."

5129,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
5130,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"It is true indeed, as has been observed by Tittmann[257], that this"
5131,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Assembly makes no effective response to the appeal of Telemachus; and
5132,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"that the Suitor Antinous is allowed to declare in it his own intention,"
5133,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and that of his companions, to continue their lawless proceedings."
5134,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,But what we see in the Odyssey is not the normal state of the heroic
5135,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,polities: it is one of those polities disorganized by the absence
5136,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of its head, with a people, as the issue proves, deeply tainted by"
5137,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"disloyalty. Yet let us see what, even in this state of things, was"
5138,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"still the weight of the Agorè. First, when Telemachus desires to make"
5139,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"an initial protest against the acts of the Suitors, he calls it to his"
5140,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"aid. Secondly, though at the outset of the discussion no concession"
5141,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"is made to him, yet he gains ground as it proceeds. The speech of"
5142,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Antinous, the first Suitor who addresses the Assembly (Od. ii. 85-128),"
5143,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"is in a tone of sheer defiance, and treats his attempt as a jest and as"
5144,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"an insult (v. 86). The next is that of Eurymachus; who, while deriding"
5145,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the omens, yet makes an advance by appealing to Telemachus to take the"
5146,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"matter into his own hands, and induce his mother to marry one among"
5147,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"them (178-207). The third, that of Leiocritus, contains a further"
5148,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"slight approximation; for it conveys an assent to his proposed voyage,"
5149,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,and recommends that Mentor and Alitherses shall assist him in making
5150,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"provision for it (242-56). Thus even here we see that progression,"
5151,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,which may always be noticed in the Homeric debates; and the influence
5152,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,under which it was effected must surely have been an apprehension of
5153,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the Assembly, to which both Telemachus, and still more directly Mentor,"
5154,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,had appealed.

5158,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Thirdly, however, we perceive in this very account the signs of the"

5160,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"sentiment of pity for Telemachus when he bursts into tears (v. 81),"
5161,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,they make no sign of approval or disapproval. We miss in Ithaca the

5181,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"The petition[259] of Ulysses to Alcinous is, that he may be sent"

5183,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"about it on the following day[260]. Accordingly, the Assembly of the"
5184,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Phæacian people is called: Minerva herself, under the form of the"

5204,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"commander, and a steersman. The dual is used in both the places where"

5207,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"number two, to three and four. See Nitzsch, in loc. But the use of it"
5208,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"here with so large a number is remarkable, and may be best explained"
5209,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"by supposing that it refers to the δύω, who were the principal men of"
5210,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the crew, and that the fifty are not regarded as forming part of the"

5224,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"not order any measure to be taken, but simply gives his opinion in the"

5226,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,46). Yet I cannot but take it for a sign of the strong popular infusion

5235,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,The havock made of the Suitors by Ulysses is at last discovered after

5237,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,and people repair in a mass to the open space where Assemblies were
5238,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"held, and which bears the same name with them[266]. Here the people are"
5239,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"addressed on the one side by Eupeithes, father of the leading Suitor"
5240,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Antinous, on the other, by Medon the herald, and Alitherses, son of"
5241,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Mastor the Seer. And here we are supplied with further proofs, that"
5242,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the Assemblies were not wholly unaccustomed to act according to their
5243,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,feelings and opinions. There is no sign of perplexity or confusion; but
5244,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"there is difference of sentiment, and each party acts upon its own."
5245,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"More than half the meeting loudly applaud Alitherses, and break up,"
5246,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,determined not to meddle in the affair[267]. The other party keep their
5247,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"places, holding with Eupeithes; they then go to arm, and undertake the"
5248,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,expedition against Ulysses. Having lost their leader by a spear’s throw
5249,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of Laertes, for which Minerva had supplied him with strength, they fall"
5250,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"like sheep before the weapons of their great chief and his son. Yet,"
5251,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"though routed, they are not treated as criminals for their resistance;"
5252,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"but the poem closes by informing us that Minerva, in the form of"
5253,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Mentor[268], negotiated a peace between the parties[269]."
5254,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
5255,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"[266] Probably the strictly proper name of the Assembly, as"
5256,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"distinguished from the place of meeting, is ἄγυρις or πανήγυρις"
5257,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"(as Od. iii. 131), but the name common to the two prevails."

5263,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"[269] Besides all the particulars which have been cited, we have"
5264,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"incidental notices scattered about the poems, which tend exactly in the"
5265,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"same direction. For example, when Chryses prays for the restitution of"
5266,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"his daughter, his petition is addressed principally to the two Atridæ,"
5267,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"but it is likewise addressed to the whole body of Ἀχαιοὶ (Il. i. 15),"
5268,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"that is, either to the entire army, or at any rate to all the kings;"
5269,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"or, to all the members of the Achæan race. This we may compare with the"
5270,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,application of the prayer of Ulysses in Scheria to the king and people.
5271,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
5272,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,~_Councils or Assemblies of Olympus._~
5273,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
5274,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Since the Assemblies of Olympus grow out of the polytheistic form of
5275,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the Greek religion, we must treat them as part of its human element,"
5276,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,and as a reflection of the heroic life. There will therefore be an
5277,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,analogy perceptible between the relation of Jupiter to the other
5278,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Immortals in the Olympian Assembly, and that of the Greek Sovereign"
5279,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,to all or some of those around him. But as the deities meet in the
5280,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"capacity of rulers, we should seek this analogy rather in the relation"
5281,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"between Agamemnon and the kings, or between the local sovereign and his"
5282,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"elders (γέροντες), than between either of the two respective heads,"
5283,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,and the mass of those whom he ruled. This analogy is in substance
5284,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,sustained by the poems. The sovereignty of Jupiter undoubtedly stands
5285,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"more elevated, among the divinities of Olympus, than that of Agamemnon,"
5286,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"or any other of his kings, on earth. It includes more of the element"
5287,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of force, and it approximates more nearly to a positive supremacy."
5288,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Accordingly, whatever indicates freedom in Olympus will tend _a"
5289,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"fortiori_ to show, that the idea of freedom in debate was, at least as"
5290,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"among the chiefs, familiar here below. Yet even in Olympus the other"
5291,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"chief deities could murmur, argue, and object. The power of Jupiter"
5292,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"is exhibited at its zenith in the Assembly of the Eighth Iliad, when"
5293,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"he violently threatens all that disobey, and challenges the whole pack"
5294,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,to try their strength with him. The vehemence with which he spoke
5295,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"produced the same intimidatory effect upon the gods, as did the great"
5296,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,speech of Achilles upon the envoys: and the result upon the minds of
5297,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the hearers in the two cases respectively, is described in lines which,"
5298,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"with the exception of a single word, precisely correspond[270]. Still,"
5299,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,immediately after Jupiter has given the peremptory order not to assist
5300,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"either party, Minerva answers, Well, we will not fight--which she never"
5301,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,had done--but we will advise; and this Jupiter at once and cheerfully
5302,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"permits[271]. But there is more than this. Be the cause what it may,"
5303,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the personal will of Jupiter, fulfilled as to Achilles[272], is not"
5304,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,fulfilled as to Troy. The Assembly of the Fourth Book is opened with a
5305,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"proposal from him, that Troy shall stand[273]. From this he recedes,"
5306,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,and it is decided that the city shall be destroyed; while the only
5307,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"reservation he makes is not at all on behalf of the Trojans, but simply"
5308,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"on behalf of his own freedom to destroy any other city he may mislike,"
5309,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,however dear it may chance to be to Juno.

5328,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,The partialities of people who manifest their feelings by visible signs
5329,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"is thus prevented, on the one hand, by the cultivation of habitual"
5330,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"self-respect, from passing into fury, and on the other hand, from"
5331,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,degenerating into baseness.
5332,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
5333,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"It is perhaps worthy of notice, as assisting to indicate the"

5335,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"affairs, that where parties were formed in the Assemblies, those who"
5336,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,thought together sat together. Such appears to be the intimation of the
5337,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"line in the Eighteenth Iliad (502),"
5338,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
5339,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"λαοὶ δ’ ἀμφοτέροισιν ἐπήπυον, ἀμφὶς ἀρωγοί."
5340,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
5341,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"As the ἀμφὶς ἀρωγοὶ expresses their sentiments, ἀμφοτέρωθεν can hardly"
5342,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,signify any thing other than that they sat separately on each side
5343,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,of the Assembly. A similar arrangement seems to be conveyed in the
5344,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Twenty-fourth Odyssey, where we find that the party of the Suitors"
5345,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"remained in a mass (τοὶ δ’ ἀθρόοι αὐτόθι μίμνον, v. 464.) I think this"
5346,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"circumstance by no means an unimportant one, as illustrative of the"
5347,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"capacity, in which the people attended at the Assemblies for either"
5348,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,political or judicial purposes.
5349,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
5350,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,~_Judicial functions of the Assembly._~
5351,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
5352,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,The place of Assemblies is also the place of judicature. But the
5353,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"supremacy of the political function is indicated by this, that the"
5354,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"word ἀγορὴ, which means the Assembly for debate, thus gives its own"
5355,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,designation to the place where both functions were conducted. At the
5356,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"same time, we have in the word Themis a clear indication that the"
5357,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,original province of government was judicial. For that word in Homer
5358,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"signifies the principles of law, though they were not yet reduced to"
5359,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,the fixed forms of after-times; but on the other hand Themis was also
5360,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"a goddess, and she had in that capacity the office of summoning and of"
5361,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"dissolving Assemblies[274]. Thus the older function, as often happens,"
5362,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"came in time to be the weaker, and had to yield the precedence to its"
5363,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,more vigorous competitor.

5386,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"In that same place, too, the public solemnities of religion were"
5387,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,performed: and though in the Greek camp it was doubtless placed at the
5388,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"centre of the line with a view to security, its position most aptly"
5389,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"symbolized also its moral centrality, as the very heart of the national"
5390,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,life. At the spot where the Assemblies were held were gathered into a
5391,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"focus the religious, as well as the patriotic sentiments of the country."
5392,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
5393,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"The fact is, that everywhere in Homer we find the signs of an intense"
5394,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"corporate or public life, subsisting and working side by side with"
5395,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,that of the individual. And of this corporate life the ἀγορὴ is the
5396,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"proper organ. If a man is to be described as great, he is always great"
5397,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"in debate and on the field; if as insignificant and good for nothing,"
5398,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,then he is of no account either in battle or in council. The two grand
5399,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,forms of common and public action are taken for the criteria of the
5400,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,individual.
5401,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
5402,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,When Homer wished to describe the Cyclopes as living in a state of
5403,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"barbarism, he says, not that they have no kings, or no towns, or"
5404,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"no armies, or no country, but that they have no Assemblies, and no"
5405,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"administration of justice, which, as we have seen, was the primary"
5406,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"function of the Assemblies. And yet all, or nearly all the States had"
5407,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Kings. The lesson to be learned is, that in heroic Greece the King,"
5408,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"venerable as was his title, was not the fountainhead of the common"
5409,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"life, but only its exponent. The source lay in the community, and the"
5410,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,community met in the Agorè. So deeply imbedded is this sentiment in
5411,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the mind of the Poet, that it seems as if he could not conceive an"
5412,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"assemblage of persons having any kind of common function, without their"
5413,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"having, so to speak, a common soul too in respect of it."
5414,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
5415,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,~_The common Soul or Τὶς in Homer._~
5416,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
5417,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Of this common soul the organ in Homer is the Τὶς or ‘Somebody;’
5418,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"by no means one of the least remarkable, though he has been one of"
5419,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the least regarded, personages of the poems. The Τὶς of Homer is, I"
5420,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"apprehend, what in England we now call public opinion. We constantly"
5421,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"find occasions, when the Poet wants to tell us what was the prevailing"
5422,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,sentiment among the Greeks of the army. He might have done this
5423,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"didactically, and described at length the importance of popular"
5424,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"opinion, and its bearings in each case. He has adopted a method more"
5425,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"poetical and less obtrusive. He proceeds dramatically, through the"
5426,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"medium of a person, and of a formula:"
5427,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
5428,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκεν, ἰδὼν ἐς πλήσιον ἄλλον."
5429,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
5430,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"It may, however, not seem worthy of remark, considering the amount of"
5431,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"common interest among the Greeks, that he should find an organ for it"
5432,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,in his Τίς. But when he brings the Greeks and Trojans together in the
5433,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Pact, though it is only for the purpose of a momentary action, still he"
5434,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"makes an integer _pro hâc vice_ of the two nations, and provides them"
5435,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,with a common Τὶς (Il. iii. 319):
5436,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
5437,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκεν Ἀχαιῶν τε Τρώων τε.
5438,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
5439,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,We find another remarkable exemplification in the case of the Suitors
5440,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"in the Odyssey. Dissolute and selfish youths as they are, and"
5441,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"competitors with one another for a prize which one only can enjoy, they"
5442,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,are nevertheless for the moment banded together in a common interest.
5443,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"They too, therefore, have a collective sentiment, and a ready organ for"
5444,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"it in a Τὶς of the Odyssey (Od. ii. 324), who speaks for the body of"
5445,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Suitors:
5446,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
5447,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκε νέων ὑπερηνορεόντων.
5448,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
5449,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"All these are, in my view, most striking proofs of the tenacious hold,"
5450,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,which the principle of a public or corporate life for all aggregations
5451,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of men had taken upon the mind of Homer, and upon Greece in the heroic"
5452,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"age. Nor can I help forming the opinion, that in all probability we may"
5453,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,discern in the Homeric Τὶς the primary ancestor of the famous Greek
5454,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,Chorus. It is the function of the Chorus to give utterance to the
5455,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"public sentiment, but in a sense apt, virtuous, and pious. Now this is"
5456,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,what the Homeric Τὶς usually does; but of course he does on behalf of
5457,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the community, what the Chorus does as belonging to the body of actors."
5458,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
5459,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"It is then surely a great error, after all we have seen, to conclude"
5460,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"that, because the political ideas and practices of those times did not"
5461,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"wear the costumes now in fashion, they were without their own real"
5462,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"vitality, and powerful moral influence upon the minds and characters of"
5463,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,men.
5464,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
5465,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,~_Imperfect organization of the Heroic Polities._~
5466,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,
5467,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"But, on the other hand, in repelling these unsound and injurious"
5468,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"notions, we must beware of assuming too much of external resemblance"
5469,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,between the heroic age and the centuries either of modern Christendom
5470,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,or even of historic Greece and Rome. All the determinate forms of
5471,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"public right are the growth of long time, of dearbought experience, and"
5472,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,of proved necessity. Right and force are supplements to one another;
5473,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"but the proportions, in which they are to be mingled, are subject to"
5474,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"no fixed rule. If the existence of rights, both popular and regal,"
5475,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"in the heroic age is certain, their indeterminateness is glaring and"
5476,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"conspicuous. But the shape they bore, notwithstanding the looseness"
5477,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of its outline, was quite adequate to the needs of the time. We must"
5478,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"not, in connection with the heroic age, think of public life as a"
5479,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"profession, of a standing mass of public affairs, of legislation"
5480,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"eternally in arrear, of a complex machinery of government. There were"
5481,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,no regular regencies in Greece during the Trojan war. There was no
5482,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Assembly in Ithaca during the long absence of Ulysses[278], before"
5483,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the one called by Telemachus, and reported in the Second Book of the"
5484,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"Odyssey. We have seen, however, in what way this lack of machinery"
5485,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"told upon the state of Greece by encouraging faction, and engendering"
5486,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,revolution. The strain of the Trojan expedition was too great for a
5487,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,system so artless and inorganic. The state of Ithaca in the Odyssey
5488,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,is politically a state almost of anarchy; though the symptoms of that
5489,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"disease were milder by far then, than they could now be. The condition"
5490,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of the island shows us what its polity had been, rather than what it"
5491,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,was. But for all ordinary occasions it had sufficed. For Assemblies
5492,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,met only when they had something to do; and rarely indeed would such
5493,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"junctures arrive. Infractions of social order and social rights, which"
5494,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"now more commonly take place by fraud, were then due almost wholly to"
5495,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"violence. And violence, from its nature, could hardly be the subject"
5496,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"of appeal to the Assembly: as a general rule, it required to be repaid"
5497,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"on the instant, and in the same coin. Judicial questions would not"
5498,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"often be of such commanding interest, as to divide a people into two"
5499,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,opinions; nor the parties to them wealthy enough to pay two talents
5500,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"to the successful judge. Great controversies, affecting allegiance"
5501,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"and the succession, must of necessity in all ages be rare; and of a"
5502,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,disputed succession in Greece the poems can hardly be said to offer
5503,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"us an instance. We find, however, in the last Book of the Odyssey,"
5504,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"that, according to the ideas of that period, when a question as to"
5505,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"the sovereignty did arise, the people needed no instructor as to the"
5506,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"first measure they were to take. They repaired, as if by a common and"
5507,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"instinctive impulse, to the Agorè; in which lay deposited their civil"
5508,THE POLITIES OF THE HOMERIC AGE.,"rights and their old traditions, like the gems of the wealth of Greece"

5529,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"two nations; what points they embraced, and what affinities or discords"
5530,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,they disclose. The direct signs of kindred between Troy and Greece have
5531,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,already been considered; but the examination into points of contrast
5532,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"and resemblance as respects religion, polity, and character, will"
5533,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,assist us in judging how far a key to those affinities and discords is
5534,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"to be found in the different interfusion and proportion, in the two"
5535,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"cases, of ethnical elements which they possessed in common."
5536,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
5537,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"We have seen in another place[280] that the Greeks, or Achæans, and the"
5538,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Trojans, were akin by the Hellic element, which appears to establish"
5539,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"a connection chiefly as regarded the royal house, and other ruling"
5540,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"houses, of Troy. On the other hand it has seemed clear, from many"
5541,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"sources, that the main affinity between the bulk of the two nations"
5542,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"was Pelasgian. As respects the ethnological question, the supposition"
5543,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"most consonant to the evidence as a whole appears to me to be, that"
5544,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"in Troas we find Hellic families, possessed of dominion over a"
5545,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Pelasgian people: in Greece we find Hellic tribes, placed in dominant"
5546,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"juxtaposition with Pelasgic tribes, of prior occupancy; constituting,"
5547,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"as is probable, whole classes of the community, and mingling with and"
5548,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,powerfully modifying the aggregate composition so as to produce a
5549,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"mixed result; while in Troy, though the ruling houses are probably a"
5550,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"different order, and there may be found here and there the tokens of"
5551,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"this influence, yet the general face of society, and the substance of"
5552,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"manners and institutions, are Pelasgian. It will be recollected, that"
5553,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,even in Greece we trace two forms of Hellic diffusion. Sometimes the
5554,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"descendants of the Helli appear as single families, like the Æolids;"
5555,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"sometimes as races, like the Achæans. The state of facts here supposed"

5680,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,upon his equivocal position as between the two parties to the war. It
5681,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"corresponds with that of the Thracians, who appear to form a point of"

5696,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,to the Sun; while the Greeks will on their part offer up a lamb to
5697,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,Jupiter. The proposal is at once accepted; and the heralds are sent by
5698,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Hector to the city for the lambs[295], which seems to be conclusive as"

5712,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"exceptions: 1. of Ceres, whom we may however suspect, from her"
5713,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Pelasgian character, to have been worshipped there under some name or"

5717,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Again, among the thirteen who have been identified as objects of Trojan"

5719,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"was worshipped in Greece; though she was invoked, as by Agamemnon in"
5720,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the Nineteenth Book, and by Althea in the Ninth, to add a more solemn"
5721,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,sanction to oaths.
5722,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
5723,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"14. Together with her, we may take notice of a fourteenth deity,"
5724,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"apparently of great consideration in Troy, namely, the River Scamander."
5725,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"He bears a marked sign of ancient worship, in having a divine"
5726,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"appellation, Xanthus, as well as his terrestrial one, Scamander. He"
5727,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"had an ἀρήτηρ, by name Dolopion. To him, according to the speech"
5728,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of Achilles, the Trojans sacrificed live horses. He enters into"
5729,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the division of parties among the gods about the war, and fights"
5730,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"vigorously against Achilles, until he is at length put down by"
5731,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Hephæstus, or Vulcan. As a purely local deity, however, he has of"
5732,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,course no place in the Greek mythology.
5733,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
5734,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,15. Though we have no direct mention of the translation of Tithonus
5735,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"by Ἠὼς, or Aurora, yet, as Homer gives Tithonus a place both in the"
5736,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"genealogy of the Dardanidæ, and likewise by the side of Aurora, we may"
5737,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"consider that, by thus recognising the translation, he also points out"
5738,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,Aurora as an acknowledged member of the supernatural order in Troas.
5739,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
5740,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,Several among these names call for more particular notice: especially
5741,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"those of Vulcan, Earth, and Scamander."

5743,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,~_Worship of Vulcan in Troas._~
5744,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
5745,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"The case of Vulcan, and his place in Troy, may serve to remind us of"
5746,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"a proposition somewhat general in its application; this namely, that,"
5747,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"in classifying the Trojan divinities, Homer need not have intended"
5748,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,to imply that the same name must in all cases carry exactly the same
5749,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"attributes. We must here bear in mind, that probably all, certainly"
5750,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"almost all, of the properly Olympian gods, were Greek copies modified"
5751,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,from Oriental or from traditive originals. But as these conceptions
5752,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"were propagated in different quarters, each country would probably add"
5753,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"or take away, or otherwise alter, in conformity with its own ruling"
5754,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"tendencies. Hence when we find a Vulcan in Greece, and a Vulcan in"
5755,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Troas, it by no means follows, that each of them presented the same"
5756,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,features and attributes. If Homer believed them to be derived from a
5757,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"common original in Egypt or elsewhere, that would be a good and valid"
5758,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"reason for his describing them by the same name, though the Trojan"
5759,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Vulcan might not present all the Hellenic traits, nor _vice versâ_."
5760,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"In some cases, such as those of Jupiter, Apollo, Minerva, Diana, and"
5761,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Venus, there is such a correspondence of attributes entering into the"
5762,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"portraiture of the respective deities in the two countries, that their"
5763,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"identity, at least so far as the evidence goes, seems quite unimpaired"
5764,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"and unequivocal. But we have no means of showing from the poems, that"
5765,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,the Trojan Hephæstus corresponded with the Greek one. Indeed when we
5766,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"find no mention of his being actually worshipped in Greece, and at the"
5767,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"same time learn that he had a priest in Troas, the presumption arises,"
5768,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,that different conceptions of him prevailed in the two countries.
5769,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Again, there is nowhere assigned to him as a Greek deity any such"
5770,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"exercise of power, as that by which he saves Idæus, a son of his priest"
5771,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Dares, from imminent death on the field of battle."
5772,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
5773,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"These general considerations, which tend to show that the identity"
5774,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,of name in a Trojan and a Greek deity may be compatible with much
5775,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of dissimilarity in the popular development of the functions, will"
5776,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"relieve us from difficulties, which we should otherwise have had to"
5777,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"meet, in accounting for the place of some of the Olympian divinities"
5778,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"in Trojan worship. We have found reason to suppose, that Vulcan may"
5779,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,have come into Greece through Phœnicia. But the Trojans appear to
5780,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,have had very little connection with Phœnicia. The precious κειμήλιον
5781,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of Priam, the cup that he carried to Achilles, was not Phœnician but"
5782,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Thracian[297]. The only token of intercourse mentioned is, that Paris"
5783,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"brought textile fabrics from Sidon[298]. Again, Vulcan was especially"
5784,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"worshipped in Lemnos, and had his terrestrial abode there. But this"
5785,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"goes more naturally to account for the works of metal in Thrace, than"
5786,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"for the position of Vulcan in Troas; higher as it was, apparently,"
5787,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"than in Greece. Again, it is worth notice, that the Vulcan of the"
5788,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Romans was, like their Mars, one of the old gods of Etruria, a country"
5789,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"stamped with many Pelasgian characteristics. It may be, that we ought"
5790,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,to look back to Egypt for the origin of all these Vulcans. In the time
5791,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of Herodotus[299], the Egyptian priests claimed him as their own: and"
5792,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Phtah, the principal deity of Memphis, was held by the later Greeks"
5793,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,to correspond with their Ἥφαιστος. Even the two names carry tokens of
5794,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,relationship. From that fountain-head might be propagated diverging
5795,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"copies of the deity: and, as far as we can judge, the Vulcan worshipped"
5796,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"in Troy was much more like the common ancestor, than the highly"
5797,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"idealized artificer of Olympus, upon whom the Poet has worked out all"

5810,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"There is another of its points of contact with the Olympian system, in"
5811,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,which this list of Trojan deities is remarkable. While investigating
5812,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the Greek mythology, we have found reason to suppose that Juno, Ceres,"
5813,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,and Gaia are but three different forms of the same original tradition
5814,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of a divine _feminine_: of whom Ceres is the Pelasgian copy, Juno"
5815,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the vivid and powerful Hellenic development, and Gaia the original"
5816,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"skeleton, retaining nothing of the old character, but having acquired"
5817,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,the function of gaol-keeper for perjurors when sent to the other
5818,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,world[301]. In the retention however of all three within the circle of
5819,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"religion, we see both the receptiveness and the universalism of the"
5820,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Greek mythology. Now, in Troy, where there was less of imaginative"
5821,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"power, the case stands very differently. Of Ceres, who represents"
5822,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the Pelasgian impression of the old earth-worshipping tradition, we"
5823,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"hear nothing in Troas. Probably she was not there, because Gaia, her"
5824,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"original, was still a real divinity for the Trojans. But how are we"
5825,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,to explain the fact that Gaia and Juno are both there? I venture to
5826,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"suggest, that it is because these are different names, the foreign and"
5827,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the domestic one, for the same thing. When Hector swears to Dolon, it"
5828,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"is by Jupiter, ‘the loud-thundering husband of Here:’ which almost"
5829,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"appears as if Juno held, in the Trojan oath, a place more or less"
5830,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,resembling the place occupied in the Greek oaths (where Juno does not
5831,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,appear at all) by Gaia.
5832,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
5833,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,[301] Rhea (ἔρα) shows us the fourth and cosmogonic side of the same
5834,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,conception.
5835,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
5836,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Again, it is obvious that, if this relation exists between Gaia and"
5837,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Juno, it explains the fact that we do not find both, so to speak,"
5838,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"thriving together. In Troas Gaia is worshipped, but Juno scarcely"
5839,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"appears. In Greece Juno is highly exalted, but Gaia has lost all body,"
5840,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,and has dwindled to a spectral phantasm. It is the want of imagination
5841,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"in the Trojan mythology, which makes it a more faithful keeper of"
5842,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"traditions, stereotyped in the forms in which they were had from their"

6073,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Scamander in Troas belonged to the elemental system and earth-worship,"
6074,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"which the Greeks, for the purposes of their Olympus, had refined away"
6075,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"into a poetical vivifying Power, replete with more bland influences:"
6076,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"retaining it, more or less, for the purpose of adjuration, in the"
6077,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"darker and sterner sense. Accordingly, while Scamander, who is also"
6078,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"called Xanthus, has, as a god, a mark of antiquity in the double"
6079,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"name[323], he shows none of the Greek anthropophuistic ingredients."
6080,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Even for speech and action, he does not take the human form; but he is,"

6088,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"more than Nature put in action, all the other Rivers of Troas exhibit"
6089,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"to us Nature purely passive, a blind instrument in the hand of deity."

6092,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"not been addressed. Again, when the Greeks have quitted the country,"
6093,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Apollo takes up the streams of the eight rivers that descend from Ida,"
6094,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"including great Scamander, like so many firemen’s hose, and turns them"
6095,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,upon the rampart to destroy it. We have no example in Homer of this

6100,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,The distinction of treatment seems to be due to a difference in the

6102,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,analogous method of proceeding with reference to the Winds. In the
6103,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Iliad they are deities, addressed in prayer, and capable of receiving"
6104,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,offerings. In the Odyssey they are mere senseless instruments of
6105,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"nature, under the control of Æolus. But then in the Iliad Homer deals"
6106,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,with them for a Greek purpose (for I do not except the impersonation
6107,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of Boreas, Il. xx. 203, where the Dardanid family is concerned): it is"

6118,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,Thus the spot is one of great notoriety; yet there is not a word
6119,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,of any deity connected with these fountains. This is in remarkable
6120,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"contrast with what we meet in Homer’s Greek topography. Ulysses[325],"
6121,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"immediately on being aware that he has been disembarked in Ithaca,"
6122,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"prays to the Nymphs of the grotto, which was dedicated to them. There"
6123,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"they had their bowls and vases, and their distaffs of stone, with which"
6124,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"they spun yarn of sea-purple[326]. And the harbour, in which he was"
6125,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"landed, was the harbour of Phorcys, the old man of the sea[327]. So"
6126,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"again at the fountain, where the people of the town drew water, there"
6127,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"was an altar of the Nymphs that presided over it, upon which all the"
6128,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"passers-by habitually made offerings[328]. Nor could this be wonderful,"
6129,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"as all groves, all fountains, all meadows, and probably all mountains,"
6130,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,had their proper indwelling Nymphs according to the Greek mythology;

6196,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"for food or in sport. We find deities, priests, prophets, ceremonial,"

6198,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Greeks are much poorer; but each of them, in and for himself, is in"

6200,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"and energetic fancy, which ranges alike over the spheres of sense and"

6297,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"with the case of Patroclus. Both are mourned for passionately, by"
6298,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,those who love them best: but the shade of Patroclus is the great
6299,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"figure in the mourning of Achilles, while Hector’s existence after"
6300,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"death is but once owned, faintly and in the abstract. Nor, as we"
6301,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"see from the Odyssey, was this homage to the shade of Patroclus a"
6302,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,thing occasional or accidental. We there meet the souls of all the
6303,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"great departed of the War, in the under-world. That region, opened"
6304,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"to Ulysses, had formerly been opened to Hercules. Even the dissolute"

6319,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Displacing the elemental powers from their ordinary religion, the"
6320,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Greeks made them gaolers, as it were, of the under-world, and gave"
6321,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,them this for their proper business. Hence they are paraded freely in
6322,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the Greek oaths[345]. Agamemnon before the Pact invokes, with Jupiter,"
6323,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the Sun, the Rivers, the Earth, the infernal gods. In the Nineteenth"
6324,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"book, the same; omitting however the Rivers, and naming, instead of"
6325,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"simply describing, the Erinües[346]. In the Fourteenth Iliad, Juno"
6326,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"apparently swears by Styx, Earth, Sea, and the infernal gods[347]. In"
6327,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the Fifteenth, by Earth, Heaven, Styx, the head of Jupiter, and their"
6328,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"marriage bed[348]. Calypso swears, for the satisfaction of Ulysses,"
6329,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"and according to his fashion as the _imponens_, by Earth, Heaven, and"
6330,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,Styx[349]. Thus the Greeks made an effective use of these earthy and
6331,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"material divinities, in connection with their large development of the"
6332,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Future State, by installing them as the official punishers of perjury."
6333,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Now the Trojans appear, from what we have seen, to have worshipped this"
6334,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"class of deities; but as super-terranean, not as sub-terranean gods."
6335,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Had they not been _thus_ worshipped at the least, Agamemnon could not"
6336,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"have included them in the Invocation of the Pact, where he had to act"
6337,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,and speak for both nations[350]. And while we see they sacrificed lambs
6338,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"to Earth and Sun, still we have a curious proof that these deities were"
6339,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,not worshipped in Troy as avengers of perjury. For when in the Tenth
6340,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Book Hector swears to Dolon, he invokes no divinity, except Jupiter"
6341,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the loud-thundering husband of Juno. There may, as we have seen here,"
6342,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,be a faint reference to the earthy character of the Trojan Juno; but
6343,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"there is no well-developed system, which uses a particular order of"
6344,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,powers for the punishment of perjurors in a future state. We can hardly
6345,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,doubt that this was primarily because the doctrine of the Future State
6346,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"was wanting in deep and practical roots, so far as we can see, among"

6521,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"wherever such an endowment was found, there must have been a priesthood"
6522,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,supported by it. For it is difficult to conceive what other purpose
6523,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"could have been contemplated, at such a time, by such an appropriation"
6524,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of land. And again we may assume that, where the τέμενος or glebe"
6525,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"existed, there would be if not a temple yet at least an altar,"
6526,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,something which localized the worship in the particular spot.
6527,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
6528,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"It is indeed much more easy to suppose a temple without a priesthood,"
6529,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"than a glebe. And here it is again remarkable, that we meet with no"
6530,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,example in Homer of a glebe set apart for an exclusively Hellic god.
6531,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,

6543,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"respects this case, we have indeed found, that the imaginative"
6544,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"deification of Nature appears to have been Hellenic, and not Pelasgian."
6545,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Still, with the case of Scamander before us, and considering that we"
6546,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,find the τέμενος attached to Spercheius in an eminently Pelasgian
6547,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"district, while there is no example of such an inheritance for the"
6548,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"deities among the Hellic tribes, it seems most rational to consider the"
6549,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"appropriation of it as belonging to the Pelasgian period, and as having"
6550,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,simply lived over into the Hellenic age.
6551,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
6552,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,3. The ἄλσος of Homer appears to be quite different from the τέμενος:
6553,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"and to mean rather what we should call a site for religious worship, as"
6554,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"distinguished from an endowment which, as such, would produce the means"
6555,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,of subsistence. Such places were required by the spirit of Hellenic
6556,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"religion, as much as by the Pelasgian worship, and we find them"
6557,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,accordingly disseminated as follows: we have
6558,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,

6566,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
6567,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"4. In Ithaca again, the ἄλσος of Apollo, where public sacrifice was"
6568,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"performed in the city on his feast-day, Od. xx. 277, 8."
6569,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,

6576,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"7. In the great Assembly of gods before the Theomachy, all the Nymphs"

6583,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
6584,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Thus the ἄλσος, when used in the religious sense, means a grove or"
6585,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"clump of trees, sometimes with turf, or with a fountain; set apart"
6586,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"as a place for worship, and inhabited by a deity or his ministers,"
6587,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,yet quite distinct from a property capable of supporting them. These
6588,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"clumps appear to be so appropriated more commonly by Hellenic, than by"

6595,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"In the opinion of Mure, the metaphor which represents human affairs"
6596,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"as resting in the lap of the gods (θεῶν ἐν γούνασι), gives conclusive"
6597,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,evidence that the custom of making statues of the deities prevailed
6598,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,among the Greeks. I do not however see why this particular figure
6599,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"should bear upon the question, more than any of the other very numerous"
6600,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,representations which treat them as endowed with various members of the
6601,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"body. If this evidence be receivable at all, it is overwhelming. But"
6602,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"it is open to some doubt, whether, because gods are mentally conceived"
6603,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"according to the laws of anthropomorphism, we may therefore assume that"
6604,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,they were also materially represented under the human form.
6605,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
6606,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"We have, I believe, no more than one single piece of direct evidence on"
6607,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the subject, and it is this; that, when the Trojan matrons carry their"
6608,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"supplication to the temple of Minerva, together with the offering of a"
6609,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"robe, they deposit it on her knees (Il. vi. 303), Ἀθηναίης ἐπὶ γούνασιν"
6610,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,ἠϋκόμοιο. This appears to be quite conclusive as to the existence of a
6611,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"statue of Minerva at Troy: but it leaves the question entirely open,"
6612,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"whether it was an Hellenic, as well as a Pelasgian, practice thus to"
6613,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,represent the gods.
6614,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
6615,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"It is quite plain, I think, that the practice was not one congenial"
6616,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"or familiar to the mind of Homer. Had it been so, he surely must have"
6617,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,made large poetic use of it. Whereas on the contrary it is by inference
6618,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"alone, though certainly by unavoidable inference, from language which"
6619,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"he uses without that intention, that we become assured even of their"
6620,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"existence in his time. He speaks, indeed, more than once of placing"
6621,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"ἀγάλματα in temples, or of suspending them in honour of the gods[360]:"
6622,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,but our title to construe this of statues appears to be wholly
6623,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,conjectural.

6626,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
6627,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"It would seem inexplicable that a poet, who enlarges with so much"
6628,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"power, not only on the Shield of Agamemnon and the Arms of Achilles,"
6629,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"but on the ideal Ægis of Minerva, the chariot of Juno, the bow"
6630,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of Apollo, and the metallic handmaids of Vulcan, should entirely"
6631,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"avoid description of the statues of the Olympian gods, if they were"
6632,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,habitually before his eyes.
6633,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
6634,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"I have argued elsewhere that we see in Homer the Hellenic, not the"
6635,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Pelasgian, mind. And if it be so, then I think we are justified"
6636,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"in associating with his Hellenism, as one among many signs, this"
6637,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,remarkable silence. The ritual and external development of Pelasgian
6638,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,religion would delight in statues as visible signs: the Hellenic
6639,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,idealism would not improbably eschew them. Hence we may treat this
6640,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,practice of the period as belonging to Pelasgian peculiarities.
6641,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
6642,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"If this be so, then I think we may pass on to the conclusion, that the"
6643,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,original tendency to produce visible forms of the Divinity was not
6644,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"owing to, and formed no part of, the efforts of the human imagination,"
6645,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"so largely developed in Homer, to idealize religion, and to beautify"
6646,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the world by its imagery. But, on the contrary, so far as we can judge"
6647,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"from Homer, it first prevailed among a race inclined to material and"
6648,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"earthy conceptions in theology, and from them it spread to others of"
6649,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"higher intelligence. It was a crutch for the lameness of man, and not"
6650,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,a wing for his upward aspirations.
6651,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
6652,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"And indeed, as it appears to me, this proposition is sustained even"
6653,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,by the past experience and present state of Christendom. When faith
6654,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"was strongest, images were unknown to the faithful. Nor is it art,"
6655,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,which produces them: it is merely a kind of corporal and mechanical
6656,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"imitation. No considerable work of art is at this moment, I believe, in"
6657,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"any Christian country, an object of religious worship. The sentiment"
6658,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,which craves for material representations of such objects in order
6659,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"to worship them, appears also commonly to exact that they should be"
6660,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"somewhat materialized. The higher office of art, in connection with"
6661,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"devout affection, seems to be that it should point our veneration"
6662,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"onwards, not arrest it. It holds out the finger which we are to follow,"

6666,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
6667,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"The order of Seers or Diviners was common to Greeks, Trojans, and"
6668,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"probably we may add, from its being known among the Cyclopes, to all"
6669,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"contemporary races. It is singular that we should find here, and not"
6670,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"among the priesthood, the traces of caste, or the hereditary descent"
6671,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of the gift. In all other points, this function stands apart from"
6672,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"hierarchical developments. For the μάντις, except as to his gift,"
6673,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,is like other men. Melampus engages to carry off oxen. Polypheides
6674,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,migrates upon a quarrel with his father. Cleitus is the lover of
6675,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,Aurora. Theoclymenus has committed homicide[361]. Teiresias is called
6676,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"ἄναξ, a lord or prince[362]. We do not know that Calchas fought as"
6677,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"well as prophesied, but it may have been so, since Helenus, the son"
6678,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of Priam, and Eunomus, the Mysian leader, were seers or augurs not"
6679,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,less than warriors. But the most instructive specimen of this order
6680,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"among the Greeks is the Suitor Leiodes[363], who was also θυοσκόος,"
6681,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"or inspector of sacrifices, to the body of Suitors. Now Ulysses had,"
6682,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"in consideration of a ransom, spared Maron the priest of Apollo at"
6683,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Ismarus[364]. But, far from recognising in the professional character"
6684,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of Leiodes a title to immunity, he answers the plea with characteristic"
6685,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"and deadly repartee. And this, notwithstanding that Leiodes was, as"
6686,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"we learn, distinguished from the rest of the Suitors by the general"

6699,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"that of the priest. Indeed, the word θύειν in Homer appears properly"

6742,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,and meets Agamemnon and Ulysses. The honour of actually offering
6743,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,the sacrifice is allotted to the Greeks. No priest appears; and the
6744,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"function is performed by the King, Agamemnon. It is therefore natural"
6745,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,to suppose that the Greeks have with them in Troas no sacrificing
6746,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"priest. On every occasion, the Greek Sovereign offers sacrifice for"
6747,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,himself and for the army. So also do the soldiery[367] at large for
6748,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,themselves;

6753,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
6754,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,There was an altar[368] for the very purpose in the part of the
6755,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"camp appropriated for Assemblies; a fact which, though it does not"
6756,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"demonstrate, accords with the union of the regal and sacerdotal"
6757,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,functions. Nor can we account for the absence of priests from the
6758,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"camp, on the same principle as for that of bards; since poems"
6759,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"were a luxury, but sacrifices a necessity. And we find Calchas"
6760,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,representing the class of religious functionaries that the Greek nation
6761,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"did acknowledge; namely, the Seers, who interpreted the divine will,"
6762,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"without any fixed ministry belonging to any particular place, although"
6763,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the gift was generally derived from Apollo, as one among his peculiar"

6772,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"could not well, on account of its importance, have been omitted. For in"
6773,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"truth this enumeration is, as we have before seen, nearly exhaustive,"
6774,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"as applied to an age when there was no professional soldier, when the"

6794,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Again, this event took place during the reign of Œneus, two generations"
6795,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,before the Trojan war[370]. At that time the Hellenic influence was
6796,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,quite recent in Middle and in Southern Greece. The family of Sisyphus
6797,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"had indeed arrived there at least two generations before, but it"
6798,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"disappeared, and it had never risen to great power. It was the date"
6799,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of Augeias, of Neleus, and of Pelops; all of them, apparently, the"
6800,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,first of their respective families in Peloponnesus. So again the name
6801,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Portheus, assigned to the father of Œneus, probably marks him as the"
6802,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,first Hellenic occupant of the country.

6811,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"The Hellenes, then, had recently come into Ætolia at the time, and"
6812,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,even on this ground were less likely to have had priests of their own
6813,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"institution. But it is not to be supposed that, finding a hierarchy"
6814,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"among the Pelasgian tribes, devoted to the worship of such deities"
6815,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"(Minerva and Apollo for example) as they themselves acknowledged, they"
6816,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"would extirpate such a body. The most probable supposition is, that"
6817,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"it would continue in all cases for a time. The person of Chryses,"
6818,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the priest of Apollo, was respected, at least for the moment, even"
6819,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"by Agamemnon[372] in his displeasure. Fearless of his threats, the"
6820,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,injured priest immediately appealed to his god for aid. We cannot doubt
6821,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"that interests thus defended would be generally left intact. Still,"
6822,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"as priests were, in the language of political economy, unproductive"
6823,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"labourers, and as they seem to have held their offices not by descent"
6824,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"but by election, we can easily perceive a road, other than that of"
6825,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"violence, to the extinction of the order among a people that set no"

6829,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
6830,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"There is yet another place, in which the name is mentioned among the"
6831,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Greeks. It is in the Assembly of the First Iliad, held while the plague"
6832,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"is raging. Achilles says, ‘Let us inquire of some prophet, or priest,"
6833,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"or interpreter of dreams (for dreams too are from Jupiter), who will"
6834,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"tell us, why Apollo is so much exasperated[373].’ But the allusion here"
6835,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"seems plainly to be to Chryses, who had himself visited the camp, and"
6836,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,had appeared with the insignia of his priestly office in a previous
6837,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,Assembly of the Greeks[374]. Being now in possession of the whole open
6838,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"country, they of course had it in their power to consult either him or"
6839,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"any other Trojan priest not within the walls. We cannot, therefore,"

6849,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"his titular ancestor, in the presence of thousands of the people. In"
6850,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,neither of these cases is there any reference to a priest: and on the

6859,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,An important piece of negative evidence to the same effect is afforded
6860,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,by the great invocation of Achilles in the Sixteenth Iliad. It will be
6861,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"remembered, that we there find the rude highland tribe of the Helli in"

6863,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,worship of the Pelasgian Jupiter; and themselves apparently exercising

6869,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"It therefore appears clear, that the Hellenic tribes of Homer’s day did"
6870,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,not acknowledge a professional priesthood of their own; that there was
6871,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,no priest in the Greek armament before Troy; that the priest was not
6872,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"a constituent part of ordinary Greek communities: and that, if he was"
6873,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"any where to be found in the Homeric times, it was as a relic, and in"

6875,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
6876,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"At a later period, when wealth and splendour had increased, and when"
6877,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the increased demand for them extended also to religious rites, the"
6878,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,priesthood became a regular institution of Greece. It is reckoned by
6879,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Aristotle, in the Politics, among the necessary elements of a State;"
6880,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"while he seems also to regard it as the natural employment of those,"
6881,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,who are disqualified by age from the performance of more active duties
6882,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"to the public, either in war or in council. The priest was, even in"
6883,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Homer’s time, a distinctly privileged person. Like other people, he"
6884,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,married and had children: but his burdens were not of the heaviest. He
6885,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"would live well on sacrifices, and the proceeds of glebe-land: and it"
6886,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"is curious, that Maron the priest had the very best wine of which we"
6887,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,hear in the poems[376]. The priest formed no part of the teaching power
6888,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of the community, either in this or in later ages. Döllinger makes the"
6889,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"observation[377], that Plutarch points out as the sources of religious"
6890,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"instruction three classes of men, among whom the priests are not even"
6891,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"included. They are (1) the poets, (2) the lawgivers, and (3) the"
6892,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,philosophers: to whom Dio Chrysostom adds the painters and sculptors.
6893,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"So that Isocrates may well observe, that the priesthood is anybody’s"
6894,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"affair. Plato[378] in the Νόμοι requires his priests, and their parents"
6895,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"too, to be free from blemish and from crime: but carefully appoints"
6896,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"a separate class of ἐξηγηταὶ, to superintend and interpret the laws"

6923,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of the Iliad, to Chryses[381] the priest (ἱερεὺς) of Apollo. In the"
6924,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"fifth Iliad we have a Trojan[382], Dares, who is priest of Vulcan; and"
6925,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"we have also Dolopion, who, as ἀρητὴρ[383] of the Scamander, filled"
6926,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,an office apparently equivalent. Chryses the priest is also called an
6927,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"ἀρητήρ[384]; and though, on the other hand, it was the duty of Leiodes"
6928,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"in the Odyssey to offer[385] prayer on behalf of the Suitors, yet"
6929,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"he is never termed ἀρητήρ. In the Sixth Iliad appears Theano, wife"
6930,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of Antenor, and priestess of Minerva[386]. And in the Sixteenth, we"
6931,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"have Onetor[387], priest of Idæan Jupiter. Again, while Eumæus in the"

7184,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"chiefs are tending the wounded Menelaus[407]; which conduct exhibits,"
7185,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"if the phrase may be permitted, an extravagance of disregard to the"
7186,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"obligations of truth and honour. Hector, in the Sixth Book, quits the"
7187,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"battle field upon an errand, to which it is hardly possible to assign"
7188,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"a poetical sufficiency of cause, unless we refer it to the readiness"
7189,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,which he not unfrequently shows to keep himself out of the fight.
7190,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Again, there is something awkward and out of keeping in his manner of"
7191,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,dealing with the Fabian recommendations of Polydamas when the crisis
7192,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"approaches. Some of these he accepts, and some he rejects, without"
7193,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"adequate reason for the difference, except that he is preparing himself"
7194,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"as an illustrious victim for Achilles, and that he must act foolishly"
7195,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"in order that the superior hero, and with him the poem itself, may not"
7196,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,be baulked of their purpose.

7202,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Thus, again, Homer has given us a pretty clear idea even of the"
7203,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,respective ages of the Greek chiefs. It can hardly be doubted that
7204,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Nestor stands first, Idomeneus second, Ulysses third: while Diomed"
7205,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,and Antilochus are the youngest; Ajax and Achilles probably the next.
7206,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"But as to Paris, Helenus, Æneas, Sarpedon, Polydamas, we find no"
7207,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,conclusion as to their respective ages derivable from the poem.
7208,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
7209,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Yet though Homer may use a greater degree of liberty in one case,"
7210,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"and a lesser in another, as to the mode of setting his jewels, he"
7211,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,always adheres to the general laws of truth and nature as they address
7212,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"themselves to his poetical purpose. Thus there may be reason to doubt,"
7213,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,whether he observed the same rigid topographical accuracy in dealing
7214,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"with the plain of Troy, as he has evinced in the Greek Catalogue: but"
7215,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"he has used materials, all of which the region supplied; and he has"
7216,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"arranged them clearly, as a poetic whole, before the mental eye of"
7217,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,those with whom he had to do. Even so we may be prepared to find that
7218,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"he deals with the moral as with the material Troas, allowing himself"
7219,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"somewhat more of license, burdening himself with somewhat less of"
7220,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,care. And then we need not be surprised at secondary or inferential
7221,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"inconsistencies in the action, as respects the Trojan people, because"
7222,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"it has not been worth his while to work the delineation of them, in"
7223,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"its details, up to his highest standard; yet we may rely upon his"
7224,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"general representations, and we are probably on secure ground in"
7225,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,contemplating all the main features of Trojan life and character as
7226,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"not less deliberately drawn, than those of the Greeks. For, in truth,"
7227,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"it was requisite, in order to give full effect among his countrymen to"
7228,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the Greek portrait, that they should be able, at least up to a certain"

7232,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
7233,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Regarding the subject from this point of view, I should say that Homer"
7234,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"has, upon the whole, assigned to the Greeks a moral superiority over"
7235,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the Trojans, not less real, though less broad and more chequered, than"
7236,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,that which he has given them in the spheres of intellectual and of
7237,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"military excellence. But, in all cases alike, he has pursued the same"
7238,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,method of casting the balance. He eschews the vulgar and commonplace
7239,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,expedient of a formal award: he decides this and every other question
7240,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"through the medium of action. The first thing, therefore, to be done"
7241,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"is, to inquire into the morality of his contemporaries, as it is"
7242,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,exhibited through the main action of the poems.
7243,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
7244,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"It is admitted on all hands that, in the ethical picture of the"
7245,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Odyssey, the distinctions of right and wrong are broad, clear, and"
7246,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,conspicuous. But the case of the Iliad is not so simple. The conduct
7247,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of Paris, which leads to the war, is so flagrant and vile, and the"
7248,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,conduct of the Greeks in demanding the restoration of Helen before they
7249,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"resort to force, so just and reasonable, that it is not unnaturally"
7250,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,made matter of surprise that any war could ever have arisen upon such a
7251,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"subject, except the war of a wronged and justly incensed people against"
7252,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"mere ruffians, traitors, and pirates. The Trojans appear at first sight"
7253,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"simply as assertors of a wrong the most gross and aggravated, even in"
7254,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"its original form; their iniquity is further darkened by obstinacy, and"
7255,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"their cause is the cause of enmity to every law, human and divine. Yet"
7256,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the Greeks do not assume to themselves, in connection with the cause of"
7257,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the war, to stand upon a different level of morality: and the amiable"
7258,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"affections, with the sense of humanity, if not the principles of honour"
7259,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"and justice, are exhibited in the detail of the Iliad as prevailing"

7264,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,Homer has really given us of the moral sense of the Greeks and the

7275,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"According to the Argument of the Κύπρια Ἔπη, as it has been handed down"

7282,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Upon this tale our ideas have been formed, and, this being so, we"
7283,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,marvel why Homer does not make the Greeks feel more indignation at a
7284,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"proceeding which simply combined treachery, robbery, and adultery. As"
7285,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"he prizes so highly the rights of guests, and pitches their gratitude"
7286,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"accordingly, we cannot understand how he should be so insensible to the"

7293,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"with what he does tell us. He tells us absolutely, that Helen was not"
7294,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"inveigled into leaving Sparta, but carried off by force: and that the"
7295,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"crime of adultery was committed after, and not before, her abduction."
7296,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
7297,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"This difference alters the character of the deed of Paris, in a"

7299,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of morality, as according to ours. As it seems plain from Homer’s"
7300,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"expression, ἁρπάξας[408], that Paris carried off Helen in the first"
7301,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"instance by an act of violence, so also it is probable that, when"
7302,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the first adultery was committed in the island of Cranae, he was her"
7303,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,ravisher much more than her corrupter. Her offence appears to have
7304,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"consisted mainly in the mere acceptance, at what precise date we know"
7305,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"not, of the relation thus brought into existence between them, and in"

7309,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"if she had refused, through the long years of her residence abroad, to"
7310,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"recognise Paris as a husband: and accordingly the light, in which she"
7311,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"is presented to us by the Poet, is that of a sufferer infinitely more"

7321,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"nay, Menelaus himself, the keenest of them all, is keen on her behalf"

7329,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,points of discrepancy from the Iliad. And there are others. For
7330,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"instance, this poem makes Pollux immortal and Castor only mortal, while"

7333,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"gives Agamemnon four daughters, the Iliad but three. It brings Briseis"
7334,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"from Pedasus, the Iliad brings her from Lyrnessus. And there is other"
7335,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"matter in the plot, that does not appear to correspond at all with the"
7336,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,modes of Homeric conception[411]. Had Homer told us the same story as

7417,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
7418,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Thus it is plain, that Menelaus resents not only a privation and an"
7419,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"act of piracy, but a base and black breach of faith. It is quite"
7420,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"plain, on the other hand, that in this respect he stands alone among"
7421,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"his countrymen. They, regarding the matter more crudely, and from a"
7422,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"distance, appear to see in it little beyond a violent abduction, which"
7423,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"it is perfectly right, for those who can, to resent and retrieve, but"

7425,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
7426,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,Hence probably that singular appearance of apathy on the part of the
7427,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Greeks, which might at first sight seem to entail on them a moral"
7428,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"reproach, in some degree allied to that which justly attaches itself"
7429,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"to the Trojan community. It is not possible, indeed, to take a full"
7430,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"measure of their state of mind in regard to the crime of Paris,"
7431,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,without condemning the views and propensities to which it was due.
7432,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,But the causes were various: and the blame they may deserve is both
7433,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"very different from that which must fall upon the Trojans, and is"
7434,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"also different in a mode, which may help to illustrate some main"
7435,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,distinctions in the two national characters.

7437,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"I speak here, as everywhere, of the adjustment of acts and motives"
7438,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"in the poem as poetical facts, that is to say, as placed relatively"
7439,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,to one another with care and accuracy in order to certain effects;
7440,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"and as liable to be tried under the law of effect, just as, in a"
7441,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"simple history, all particulars alleged are liable to be tried under"
7442,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,the law of fact. The assumption of truth or fable in the poem does
7443,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,not materially widen or narrow the field of poetical discussion. The
7444,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"critic looks for consistency as between motive and action, causes and"
7445,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"effects, in the voyage to Lilliput or Laputa, as well as in Thucydides"
7446,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"or Clarendon. The difference is that, in the one case, our discussion"
7447,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,terminates with the genius of the inventor; in the other we are
7448,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,verifying the life and condition of mankind.

7450,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"If then we admit the abduction, and inquire for what probable cause it"
7451,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"is that the wrong, being so obvious and gross, was not more prominent"
7452,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"in the mind of the people who had endured it, a part at least of the"
7453,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,answer is this. We do not require to go back three thousand years in
7454,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the history of the world in order to learn how often it happens that,"
7455,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"when a conflict has arisen between nations, the original causes of"
7456,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,quarrel tend irresistibly to become absorbed and lost in its incidents.
7457,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,As long as honour and security are held to depend more on strength than
7458,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"on right, relative strength must often prevail over relative right"
7459,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"in the decision of questions, where the arbitrement of battle has"
7460,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"been invoked. Both the willingness of the Trojans to restore, and the"
7461,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"willingness of the Greeks to accept the atonement, may be expedients of"
7462,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,the Poet to give a certain moral harmony to his work; of which it is
7463,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"a marked feature that it artfully divides our sympathies throughout,"
7464,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,so far at least as is needed for the interest of the poem. On the one
7465,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"side, the ambition and rapacity of Agamemnon may have induced him not"
7466,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"only not to seek, but even to decline or discourage accommodation;"
7467,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"which, we may observe, he never promotes in the Iliad. Having got a"
7468,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"fair cause of war, he may have been bent on making the most of it,"
7469,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"and confident, as Thucydides believes he was, in his power to turn it"
7470,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"to account. While, on the other hand, Troy was not so far from or so"
7471,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"strange to Greece, as to be exempt from the fear of appearing afraid;"
7472,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"and, until it had become too late, she may have thought her safety"

7474,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
7475,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Here may be reasons why restitution was neither given on the one side,"

7477,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,included in the idea of the capture of the city. But it is not clear
7478,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,that this was enough to account for the apathy of the Greeks in general
7479,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"with respect to the crime of Paris, which we might have expected to"
7480,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"find a favourite and familiar topic with his enemies at large, instead"

7488,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
7489,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"According to Christian morality, the abduction and appropriation of a"
7490,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"married woman is not simply a crime when committed, but it is a crime"
7491,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"that is aggravated by every day, during which her relation with her"
7492,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,seducer or ravisher is continued. This was not so in the heroic age.
7493,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
7494,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,We have examples in the poems of what Homer considers to be a continued
7495,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"course of crime. Such is the conduct of the Suitors in the Odyssey,"
7496,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"who for years together waste the substance of Ulysses, woo his wife,"
7497,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"oppress his son, and cohabit with the servants. This was habitual"
7498,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"crime, crime voluntarily and deliberately persevered in, when it might"

7500,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
7501,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,This vicious course of the Suitors is never called by Homer an ἄτη; it
7502,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,is described by the names of ἀτασθαλίαι and ὑπερβασίη[422]. So likewise
7503,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the series of enormities committed by Ægisthus, the corruption of"
7504,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Clytemnestra, the murder of her husband, the expulsion of Orestes and"

7506,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of ἄτη; but ἄτη, and not one of the severer names quoted above, is the"
7507,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,appellation always given by Homer to the crime of Paris.

7512,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"The ἄτη of a man is a crime so far partaking of the nature of error,"
7513,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,that it is done under the influence of passion or weakness; perhaps
7514,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"excluding premeditation, perhaps such that its consequences follow"
7515,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"spontaneously in its train, without a new act of will to draw them,"
7516,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"so that the act, when once committed, is practically irretrievable."
7517,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Something, according to Homer, was evidently wanting in the crime of"
7518,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Paris, to sink it to the lower depths of blackness. Perhaps we may find"
7519,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"it partly in the nature of marriage, as it was viewed by his age."
7520,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
7521,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Having taken Helen to Troy, he made her his wife, and his wife she"
7522,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,continued until the end of the siege. We should of course say he did
7523,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"not make her his wife, for she was the wife of another man. But the"
7524,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"distinction between marriage _de facto_ and marriage _de jure_, clear"
7525,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"to us in the light of Divine Revelation, was less clear to the age of"
7526,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,Homer. Helen was to Paris the mistress of his household; the possessor
7527,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of his affections, such as they were; the sole sharer, apparently,"
7528,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,of his dignities and of his bed. To the mind of that period there
7529,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"was nothing dishonourable in the connection itself, apart from its"
7530,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"origin; while, to our mind, every day of its continuance was a fresh"
7531,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,accumulation of its guilt. The higher wrong of wounded and defrauded
7532,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,affections was personal to Menelaus. In the aspect it presented to the
7533,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"general understanding, the act of Paris, once committed, and sealed by"
7534,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the establishment of the _de facto_ conjugal relation, remained an act"
7535,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,of plunder and nothing else.
7536,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
7537,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,~_And to Greek views of homicide._~
7538,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
7539,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"To comprehend these notions, so widely differing from our own, we may"
7540,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,seek their further illustration by a reference to the established view
7541,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of homicide. He, who had taken the life of a fellow creature, was"
7542,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,bound to make atonement by the payment of a fine. If he offered that
7543,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"atonement, it was not only the custom, but the duty, of the relations"
7544,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of the slain man to accept it. So much so, that the blunt mind of"
7545,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,Ajax takes this ground as the simplest and surest for argument with
7546,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Achilles, whom he urges not to refuse reparation offered by Agamemnon,"
7547,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,in consideration that reparation (ποίνη) covers the slaughter of a
7548,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"brother or a son. Beforehand, the Greek would have scorned to accept a"
7549,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"price for life. But, the deed being done, it came into the category of"
7550,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"exchangeable values. Even so the abstraction of Helen, once committed,"
7551,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"assumed for the common mind the character of an act of plunder,"
7552,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"differing from the case of homicide, inasmuch as the thing taken could"
7553,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"be given back, but not differing from it as to the essence of its moral"
7554,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"nature, however aggravated might have been the circumstances with which"
7555,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,it was originally attended.
7556,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
7557,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Now, wherever the moral judgment against plunder has been greatly"
7558,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"relaxed, that of fraud in connection with it is sure to undergo a"
7559,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"similar process; because, in the same degree in which acts of plunder"
7560,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"are acquitted as lawful acquisition, fraud is sure to come into"
7561,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"credit by assuming the character of stratagem. We may, I think, find"
7562,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"an example of this rule in the Thirteenth Odyssey; where, with an"
7563,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"entire freedom from any consciousness of wrong, Ulysses feigns to have"
7564,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"slaughtered Orsilochus at night by ambush, in consequence of a quarrel"
7565,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,that had previously occurred about booty[423].

7568,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
7569,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Here then we reach the point, at which we must take into view the"
7570,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"peculiar ideas and tendencies of the Greek mind in the heroic age,"
7571,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,as they bear necessarily upon its appreciation of an act like that
7572,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of Paris. The Greeks, of whom we may fairly take Diomed as the type,"
7573,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"detest and despise him for affectation, irresolution, and poltroonery:"
7574,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"these are the ideas uppermost in their mind: we are not to doubt that,"
7575,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"besides seeking reparation for Menelaus, they condemned morally the"
7576,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"act which made it needful; what we have to account for is, that they"
7577,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,did not condemn it in such a manner as to make this moral judgment the
7578,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,ruling idea in their minds with regard to him.
7579,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
7580,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"We have seen that, according to Homer, instead of Helen’s having been"
7581,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"originally the willing partner of the guilt of Paris, he was, under her"
7582,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"husband’s roof, her kidnapper and not her corrupter. Her offence seems"
7583,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"to have consisted in this, that she gave a half-willing assent to the"
7584,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,consequences of the abduction. Though never escaping from the sense of
7585,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"shame, always retaining along with a wounded conscience her original"
7586,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"refinement of character, and apparently fluctuating from time to time"
7587,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"in an alternate strength and weakness of homeward longings[424], the"
7588,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"specific form of her offence, according to the ideas of the age, was"
7589,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"rather the preterite one of unresisting acquiescence, than the fact"
7590,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,of continuing to recognise Paris as a husband during the lifetime of
7591,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Menelaus. It was the having changed her husband, not the living with a"
7592,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,man who was not her husband; and hence we find that she was most kindly
7593,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"treated in Troy by that member of the royal house, namely Hector, who"
7594,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,was himself of the highest moral tone.
7595,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
7596,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,[424] See Il. iii. 139. Od. iv. 259-61.
7597,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
7598,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"The offence of Paris, though also (except as to the mere restitution"
7599,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of plundered goods) a preterite offence, was more complex. He violated"
7600,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the laws of hospitality, as we find distinctly charged upon him by"
7601,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,Menelaus[425]. He assumed the power of a husband over another man’s
7602,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"wife. This he gained by violence. Now, paradoxical as it may appear,"
7603,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"yet perhaps this very ingredient of violence, which we look upon as"
7604,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"even aggravating the case, and which in the view of the Greeks was the"
7605,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"proper cause of the war, (for their anxiety was to avenge the forced"
7606,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"journey and the groans of Helen,) may nevertheless have been also the"
7607,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"very ingredient, which morally redeemed the character of the proceeding"
7608,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,in the eyes of Greece. This it might do by lifting it out of the
7609,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"region of mere shame and baseness, into that class of manful wrongs,"
7610,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,which they habitually regarded as matters to be redressed indeed by
7611,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the strong hand, but never as merely infamous. Hence, when we find the"
7612,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Greeks full of disgust and of contempt towards Paris, it is only for"
7613,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,the effeminacy and poltroonery of character which he showed in the war.
7614,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,His original crime was probably palliated to them by its seeming to
7615,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,involve something of manhood and of the spirit of adventure. So that we
7616,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,may thus have to seek the key to the inadequate sense among the Greeks
7617,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of the guilt of Paris in that which, as we have seen, was the capital"
7618,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"weakness of their morality; namely, its light estimation of crimes of"
7619,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"violence, and its tendency to recognise their enterprise and daring as"

7745,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,that the doctrine of a future state was less lively and operative among

7747,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,that deficiency in connection with the national want of all regard
7748,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"for truth. This difference teaches us, that the imprecations against"

7755,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of Troy; and that, whereas in Greece we are told occasionally of some"
7756,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"beautiful woman who is seduced or ravished by a deity, in Troas we"
7757,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,find the princes of the line are those to whose names the legends are

7759,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"over such subjects, but that in the latter no sense of shame required"
7760,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,them to be kept secret. The cases that come before us are those of
7761,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Tithonus, who is said to become the husband of Aurora; of Anchises, for"
7762,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"whom Venus conceives a passion; and of Paris, on whom the same deity"
7763,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"confers the evil gift of desire[433], and to whom she promises the most"
7764,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"beautiful of women, the wife of Menelaus. All these are stories, which"

7904,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,The most important conclusion derivable from the comparison of the

7906,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"their mothers, fell into three ranks:"
7907,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
7908,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,1. The children of Hecuba.
7909,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
7910,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,2. The children of his other wives.
7911,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
7912,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"3. The children of concubines, or of chance attachments, who were,"
7913,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"νόθοι, bastards."
7914,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
7915,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"The name νόθος with Homer, at least among the Greeks, ordinarily marks"
7916,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,inferiority of condition. The mothers of the four νόθοι are never
7917,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"named. This may, however, be due to accident. At any rate Lycaon"
7918,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,appears to have the full rank of a prince: he was once ransomed with
7919,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the value of a hundred oxen, and, when again taken, he promises thrice"
7920,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"as much; again, in describing himself as the half-brother of Hector,"
7921,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,he avows nothing like spurious birth. The reference to him by Priam
7922,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"explains his position more clearly, and places it beyond doubt that"
7923,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Laothoe was recognised as a wife, for she brought Priam a large"
7924,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"dowry[445]; and if her sons be dead, says the aged king, ‘it will be"
7925,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,an affliction to me and to their mother.’ The language used in another
7926,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,passage about Polydorus is also conclusive[446]. He is described as the
7927,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"youngest and dearest of the sons of Priam, which evidently implies his"
7928,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"being in the fullest sense a member of the family. Again, in the palace"
7929,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of Priam there were separate apartments, not for the nineteen only, but"
7930,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,for the fifty. Thus they seem to have included all the three classes.
7931,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,So that it is probable enough that the state of illegitimacy did not
7932,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"draw the same clear line as to rank in Troy, which it drew in Greece."

7956,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,women who were in no permanent relation of any kind with Priam.
7957,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
7958,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Beyond the case of Priam, we have slender means of ascertaining the"
7959,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"usages and ideas of marriage among the Trojans. We have Andromache,"
7960,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"wife of Hector; Helen, a sort of wife to Paris; Theano, wife to"
7961,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Antenor, and priestess of Minerva; who also took charge of and brought"
7962,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,up his illegitimate son Pedæus[448]. The manner in which this is
7963,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"mentioned, as a favour to her husband, certainly shows that the mark"
7964,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of bastardy was not wholly overlooked, even in Troy. But, besides this"

7966,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"other sons of Antenor, all, I think, within the fighting age. This is"
7967,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"not demonstrative, but it raises a presumption that some of them were"
7968,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,probably the sons of other wives than Theano; who is twice described as
7969,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Theano of the blooming cheeks, and can hardly therefore be supposed to"

7979,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"mothers. It is possible that the manners of Troy, with regard to"

7981,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,with those which Tacitus ascribes to the Germans of his own day:

7983,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"libidine, sed ob nobilitatem, plurimis nuptiis ambiuntur_[450]. We"
7984,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"must add to this, that Paris, in detaining as his wife the spouse of"
7985,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"another man still living, does an act of which we have no example,"
7986,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"to which we find no approximation, in the Greek manners of the time."

8001,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,character of indissolubility. The difference is very remarkable between
8002,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the horror which attaches to the first crime of Ægisthus in Greece,"
8003,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the corruption of Clytemnestra, though it was analogous to the act of"
8004,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Paris, and the indifference of the Trojans to the offence committed"
8005,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,by their own prince. We have no means indeed of knowing directly how
8006,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Ægisthus was regarded by the Greeks around him, during the period"
8007,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,which preceded the return and murder of Agamemnon. But we find that

8074,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"It has been noticed, that the idea of hereditary succession was"
8075,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"definite, as well as familiar, in Greece. In Troy it appears to have"
8076,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,been less so. And this is certainly what we might expect from the
8077,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"recognition in any form, however qualified, of polygamy. It tends to"
8078,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"confound the position of any one wife, although supposed supreme, with"
8079,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"that of others; and in confounding the order of succession, as among"
8080,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the issue of different wives, it altogether breaks up the simplicity of"

8083,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"And again, if, as we shall presently see, the Trojan race had a less"

8091,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
8092,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"1. Sarpedon was clearly leader of the Lycians, with some kind of"

8094,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
8095,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,The general tenour of the poem clearly gives this impression. He speaks
8096,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,and acts as the person principally responsible[458]. But by birth he
8097,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,was inferior to Glaucus; for he was the grandson of Bellerophon only
8098,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"in the female line through Laodamia, while Glaucus stood alone in the"
8099,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,male line through Hippolochus. I do not venture to rely much on the
8100,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"mere order of the names; and therefore I do not press the fact, which"
8101,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"indeed is not needed for the argument, that it makes Laodamia junior"
8102,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"to Hippolochus. It will be said that Sarpedon was in chief command,"
8103,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,because he was of superior merit. But among the Greeks we have no
8104,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,instance in which superior merit gives preeminence as against birth.
8105,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,And the reputation of divine origin clearly could not put aside the

8112,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,to the same kingdom. Hippolochus was perhaps still alive[460]; for
8113,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"he gave Glaucus a parting charge, and his death is not mentioned. In"
8114,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Greece we find the heir apparent called king, namely, Achilles: but"
8115,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,the title is never given to more than one person standing in the line
8116,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of succession. A possible explanation, I think, is, that the Lycian"
8117,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"kingdom had been divided[461]: but if this be not so, then the use of"
8118,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,the term seems to prove that in Asia all the children of the common

8130,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,supposing that Æneas represented the elder branch of the house of
8131,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Dardanus. But, whether he did so or not, it is sufficiently clear from"
8132,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,the Iliad that he was not without pretensions to the succession. The
8133,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"dignity of his father Anchises is marked by his remaining at Dardania,"
8134,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,and not appearing in the court of Priam. Æneas habitually abstains
8135,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"from attending the meetings or assemblies for consultation, in which"
8136,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Priam, where they are civil, and Hector, where they are military,"
8137,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,takes the lead. Achilles taunts him expressly with looking forward to
8138,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the succession after the death of Priam, and with the anticipation of"
8139,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"public lands which he was to get from the Trojans forthwith, if he"
8140,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"could but slay the great Greek warrior. The particular succession, to"
8141,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"which the taunt refers, is marked out; it is the dominion, not over the"
8142,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"mere Dardanians, but over the Τρῶες ἱππόδαμοι[463]. In following down"
8143,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the genealogy, Æneas does not adhere to either of the two lines (from"
8144,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Ilus and Assaracus respectively) throughout, as senior, and therefore"
8145,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"supreme; but, after putting the line of Ilus first in the earlier part"
8146,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of the chain, he places his own birth from Anchises before that of"

8156,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,Greeks. Even the incidental notice of the right of Priam to give it

8166,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"poems, confidently mark out one of his sons as having been the eldest,"
8167,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,or as standing on that account in the line of succession to the throne
8168,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of Priam. The evidence, so far as it goes, seems rather to point to"

8188,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"him, and he stands in a position wholly distinct from the family of"
8189,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Priam. As among the members of that family, there can be no doubt of"
8190,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the preeminence of Hector. He was, indeed, in actual exercise of the"
8191,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"heaviest part of the duties of sovereignty. Æneas, in the genealogy,"
8192,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"finishes the line of Assaracus with himself; and, to all appearance,"

8296,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"since after the slaughter of Eetion, her father, Achilles shortly"
8297,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"took a ransom for her mother, who thereupon went back to the house of"
8298,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"her own father, Andromache’s maternal grandfather, and subsequently"
8299,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,died there[473]. If then the grandfather of Andromache was alive when
8300,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Thebe was taken, and Hector’s age was in due proportion to her own,"
8301,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"he must in all likelihood have been younger than Paris. Again, it may"
8302,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"be noticed that the term ἥβη is nowhere ascribed to Paris, but it is"
8303,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,assigned to Hector at his death[474]. Notwithstanding its complimentary
8304,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"use for Ulysses in Od. viii. 135, that word has a certain leaning to"
8305,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"early life. But we have a stronger, and indeed I think a conclusive"

8319,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"certain, under these circumstances, that Paris was the first-born son"
8320,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of Priam[476], but that his right of succession oozed away like water"

8322,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,

8327,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,The relations of race between the Trojans and the Greeks have already
8328,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"been examined, in connection with the great Homeric title of ἄναξ"
8329,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"ἀνδρῶν[477]; under some difficulties, which resolve themselves into"
8330,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"this, that Homer, on almost every subject so luminous a guide, is in"
8331,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"all likelihood here, as it were, retained on the side of silence; and"
8332,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"that we have no information, except such as he accidentally lets fall."
8333,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,But he was under no such preoccupation with regard to the institutions
8334,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of Troy; so that, while he had no occasion for the same amount of"
8335,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"detail as he has given us with reference to the Greeks, or the same"
8336,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"minute accuracy as he has there observed, enough appears to supply a"
8337,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,tolerably clear and consistent outline.

8340,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
8341,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"We have been accustomed too negligently to treat the Homeric term Troy,"
8342,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,as if it designated only or properly a single city. But in Homer it
8343,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"much more commonly means a country, with the city sometimes called Troy"
8344,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"for its capital, and containing many other cities beside it. The proper"
8345,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"name, however, of the city in the poems is Ἴλιος, not Τροίη. Ilios"
8346,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"is used above an hundred and twenty times in the Iliad and Odyssey,"
8347,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,and always strictly means the city. The word Τροίη is used nearly
8348,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"ninety times, and in the great majority of cases it means the country."
8349,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Often it has the epithets εὐρεῖα, ἐρίβωλος, ἐριβώλαξ, which speak for"
8350,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,themselves. But more commonly it is without an epithet; and then too it
8351,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"very generally means the country. When the Greeks speak, for example,"
8352,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of the voyage Τροίηνδε, this is the natural sense, rather than to"
8353,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"suppose it means a city not on the sea shore, and into which, till the"
8354,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"end of the siege, they did not find their way at all[478]."
8355,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
8356,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,[478] One only of the epithets of the word Ilios seems to point out
8357,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"that it may too mean the district. It is εὔπωλος, used Il. v. 551, and"
8358,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,in four other places.

8370,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
8371,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,Thus the name of Troes at that time covered the whole race. But the
8372,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"town of Ilios must, from its name, have been built not earlier than"
8373,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the time of Ilus, the son of Tros. And now the dynasty separates into"
8374,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"two lines, as Assaracus, the brother of Ilus, continues to reign in"
8375,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,Dardania. Thus the local existence of the Dardanian name is prolonged;
8376,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"for it is plain that the Dardanian throne was associated, at least in"
8377,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"dignity, with a rival, and not a subordinate, sovereignty. Still it"
8378,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,does not extend beyond the hills. It was over these that Æneas fled
8379,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,from Achilles[480]. But even the Dardanians did not wholly cease to be
8380,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,known by the appellation of Trojans; for not only does Homer frequently
8381,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"use the dominant name Troes for the entire force opposed to the Greeks,"
8382,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"which is naming the whole from the principal part, but he also uses the"
8383,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"word Troes to signify all that part of the force, which was under the"
8384,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,house of Dardanus in either branch; and he distinguishes this portion

8438,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"It seems evident, that these five first-named contingents comprise the"

8440,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"of the capital and its district, under Hector. Then, taking precedence"
8441,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"on account of dignity, the Dardanian division of Æneas. In the third"
8442,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"contingent the Poet returns to the name Troes, which, I think, plainly"
8443,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"enough overrides the fourth and fifth, just as in the Greek Catalogue"
8444,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,the name Pelasgic Argos[486] introduces and comprehends a number of

8449,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"There are several reasons, which tend plainly to this conclusion."
8450,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,The sense of διέκριθεν (815) and the reference to the diversity of
8451,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,tongues spoken (804) almost require the division of the force between
8452,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,Troes and allies; it is also the most natural division. The fourth
8453,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"and fifth contingents are not indeed expressly called Troes, but this"
8454,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"name, already given to the third, may include them. We must, I think,"
8455,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"conclude that it does so, when we find clear proof that they were"
8456,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,not independent national divisions: for the troops of Percote were
8457,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"in the fifth, but the sons of Percosian Merops command the fourth, a"
8458,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"fact inexplicable if these were the forces of independent States, but"
8459,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,natural enough if they were all under the supremacy of Priam and his
8460,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,house.
8461,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
8462,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"In the great battle of the Twelfth Iliad, the Trojans are πένταχα"
8463,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,κοσμηθέντες (xii. 87). Sarpedon commands the allies with Glaucus
8464,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"and Asteropæus (v. 101), thus accounting for eleven of the sixteen"
8465,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"divisions in the Catalogue. Æneas, with two sons of Antenor, commands"
8466,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"the Dardanians, thus disposing of a twelfth. Again, Hector, with"
8467,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"Polydamas and Cebriones, commands the πλεῖστοι καὶ ἄριστοι, evidently"
8468,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,the division standing first in the Catalogue. This makes the number
8469,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,thirteen. The three remaining contingents of the Catalogue are
8470,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,

8477,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,
8478,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,These three remaining divisions of the Catalogue evidently reappear
8479,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,in the second and third of the five Divisions of the Twelfth Book.
8480,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,"The Second is under Paris, with Alcathous, son-in-law of Antenor, and"

8494,THE TROJANS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THE GREEKS.,than it actually states; and he says that Troas certainly reached to

8529,[490] P. 585.,"Whenever the Dardans are named with the Troes, there is also another"

8532,[490] P. 585.,"The word Troes, it is right to add, is sometimes confined strictly to"

8534,[490] P. 585.,always with contextual indications that such is the sense.
8535,[490] P. 585.,
8536,[490] P. 585.,Another sign that Priam exercised a direct sovereignty over the
8537,[490] P. 585.,territory which yielded the five contingents may perhaps be found in
8538,[490] P. 585.,"the fact, that we do not find any of his nephews in command of them."
8539,[490] P. 585.,"They were led by their local officers, while the brothers of Priam"
8540,[490] P. 585.,"constituted a part of the community of Troy, and chiefly influenced the"
8541,[490] P. 585.,"Assembly: and their sons, though apparently more considerable persons"
8542,[490] P. 585.,"than most of those local officers in general, simply appear as acting"
8543,[490] P. 585.,"under Hector without special command. The brothers of Priam are Lampus,"
8544,[490] P. 585.,"Clytius, and Hiketaon. His nephews and other relatives are Dolops the"
8545,[490] P. 585.,"son of Lampus; Melanippus the son of Hiketaon; Polydamas, Hyperenor,"
8546,[490] P. 585.,"and Euphorbus, the sons of Panthous and his wife Phrontis."

8548,[490] P. 585.,"Had the senior members of the family held local sovereignties, we"
8549,[490] P. 585.,should have found their sons in local commands. But we find only two

8556,[490] P. 585.,"states one he thinks was Lelegian, and was ruled over by Altes,"
8557,[490] P. 585.,"father of Laothoe, one of Priam’s wives. Another by Munes, husband of"
8558,[490] P. 585.,"Briseis. Another, Thebe, by Eetion, father of Andromache. Others he"
8559,[490] P. 585.,considers to be represented by Anchises and Pandarus: but this does
8560,[490] P. 585.,not well agree with the structure of the Catalogue. He refers also
8561,[490] P. 585.,to Lyrnessus and Pedasus; which are nowhere mentioned by Homer as
8562,[490] P. 585.,"furnishing contingents, but they had apparently been destroyed, as well"
8563,[490] P. 585.,"as taken, by Achilles. He places several of the dynasties in cities"
8564,[490] P. 585.,"thus destroyed: and they all, according to him, lay beyond the limits"

8570,[490] P. 585.,"relations subsisting between Priam, with his capital, and the states,"
8571,[490] P. 585.,"cities, and races, of which we hear as arrayed on his side in the war."
8572,[490] P. 585.,"There are first the cities of Troas, or Troja proper, furnishing the"
8573,[490] P. 585.,"five, or if we except Dardania four out of the five, first contingents"
8574,[490] P. 585.,of the Catalogue. Over these Priam was sovereign.

8578,[490] P. 585.,and Munes. These were probably in the same sort of relation to the

8587,[490] P. 585.,described the Trojan war as the conflict between the Eastern and the
8588,[490] P. 585.,"Western world. The two confederacies, which then came into collision,"

8604,[490] P. 585.,"class collected for separate action in the conduct of the war. Still,"

8616,[490] P. 585.,"active duties of kingship on their children, and to retain, perhaps"
8617,[490] P. 585.,"only for a time, those of a sedentary character. Hence Hector at least"
8618,[490] P. 585.,"shares with Priam the management of Assemblies, as it is he[496] who"
8619,[490] P. 585.,"dissolves that of the Second Book, and calls the military one of the"
8620,[490] P. 585.,"Eighth. Hence, too, he speaks of himself as the person responsible for"
8621,[490] P. 585.,"the burdens entailed by the war upon the Trojans. ‘I did not,’ he says"
8622,[490] P. 585.,"to the allies, ‘bring you from your cities to multiply our numbers,"
8623,[490] P. 585.,but that you might defend for me the wives and children of Trojans;
8624,[490] P. 585.,"with this object in view, I exhaust the people for your pay and"
8625,[490] P. 585.,"provisions[497].’ Hence we have Æneas leading the Dardanians, while his"
8626,[490] P. 585.,"father Anchises nowhere appears, and, as it must be presumed, remains"
8627,[490] P. 585.,"in his capital. Hence, while ten or twelve sons of Antenor bear arms"
8628,[490] P. 585.,"for Troy, and two of them are the colleagues of Æneas in the command of"
8629,[490] P. 585.,"the Dardanian contingent, their father appears among the δημογέροντες,"
8630,[490] P. 585.,who were chief speakers in the Assembly within the city. We do not know
8631,[490] P. 585.,that Antenor was a king; more probably he held a lordship subordinate
8632,[490] P. 585.,"to Priam, in a relation somewhat more strict than that between"
8633,[490] P. 585.,"Agamemnon and the Greek chieftains, and rather resembling that between"
8634,[490] P. 585.,Peleus and Menœtius; but the same custom of partial retirement seems to

8663,[490] P. 585.,"invites them to bivouac outside the Greek rampart, and they accept"
8664,[490] P. 585.,his proposal by acclamation. This Assembly on the field of battle is
8665,[490] P. 585.,"an argument _a fortiori_ to show, that ordinary affairs were referred"
8666,[490] P. 585.,"among the Trojans to such meetings. We have, indeed, no detail of any"
8667,[490] P. 585.,"Trojan Assembly except these three. But we have references to them,"
8668,[490] P. 585.,"which give a similar view of their nature and functions. Idæus, on his"

8670,[490] P. 585.,"is plain that the restoration of Helen was debated before, as well as"
8671,[490] P. 585.,"during the war, in the Assembly of the people; because Agamemnon slays"
8672,[490] P. 585.,the two sons of Antimachus on the special ground that the father had
8673,[490] P. 585.,"there proposed that Menelaus, if not Ulysses, should be murdered[502],"

8676,[490] P. 585.,"to oppose the measure[503]. Again, Polydamas, in one of his speeches,"
8677,[490] P. 585.,"charges Hector with having used him roughly, when he had ventured"
8678,[490] P. 585.,"to differ from him in the Assemblies, upon the ground that he ought"

8784,[490] P. 585.,following reasons:
8785,[490] P. 585.,
8786,[490] P. 585.,1. That although we often hear of deliberations and decisions taken on
8787,[490] P. 585.,"the part of the Trojans, and we have instances enough of their holding"
8788,[490] P. 585.,"assemblies of the people, yet we never find mention of a βουλὴ, or"
8789,[490] P. 585.,"Council, in connection with them."
8790,[490] P. 585.,
8791,[490] P. 585.,"2. In the Second Book, Homer describes the Trojan ἀγορὴ thus (Il. ii."
8792,[490] P. 585.,"788, 9):"
8793,[490] P. 585.,
8794,[490] P. 585.,οἱ δ’ ἀγορὰς ἀγόρευον ἐπὶ Πριάμοιο θύρῃσιν
8795,[490] P. 585.,"πάντες ὁμηγερέες, ἠμὲν νέοι ἠδὲ γέροντες."
8796,[490] P. 585.,
8797,[490] P. 585.,"This latter line is only to be accounted for by the supposition, that"
8798,[490] P. 585.,"Homer meant to describe a difference between the usages of the Trojans,"
8799,[490] P. 585.,and those of the Greeks; whose γέροντες were recognised as members of
8800,[490] P. 585.,"the βουλὴ, even when in the Assemblies."
8801,[490] P. 585.,
8802,[490] P. 585.,"Of the separate place of the Greek γέροντες in the Assemblies, we have"
8803,[490] P. 585.,"conclusive proof from the Shield of Achilles (xviii. 497, 503):"
8804,[490] P. 585.,
8805,[490] P. 585.,λαοὶ δ’ εἰν ἀγορῇ ἔσαν ἄθροοι·
8806,[490] P. 585.,
8807,[490] P. 585.,"and afterwards,"
8808,[490] P. 585.,
8809,[490] P. 585.,οἱ δὲ γέροντες
8810,[490] P. 585.,"εἵατ’ ἐπὶ ξεστοῖσι λίθοις, ἱερῷ ἐνὶ κύκλῳ."
8811,[490] P. 585.,
8812,[490] P. 585.,"And again, where the Ithacan γέροντες make way for Telemachus, as he"
8813,[490] P. 585.,passes to the chair of his father.
8814,[490] P. 585.,
8815,[490] P. 585.,But in Troy the γέροντες (such is probably the meaning of Il. ii. 789.)
8816,[490] P. 585.,have no separate function: the young and the old meet together: while
8817,[490] P. 585.,"in Greece, besides distinct places in the Assembly, the γέροντες had an"
8818,[490] P. 585.,"exclusive function in the βουλὴ, at which they met separately from the"
8819,[490] P. 585.,young.
8820,[490] P. 585.,
8821,[490] P. 585.,"3. It would appear that the ἀγορὴ was with the Trojans not occasional,"
8822,[490] P. 585.,"as with the Greeks, for great questions, but habitual. And this agrees"
8823,[490] P. 585.,with the description in Il. ii. 788. For when Jupiter sends Iris to
8824,[490] P. 585.,"Troy, she finds the people in Assembly, but apparently for no special"
8825,[490] P. 585.,"purpose, as she immediately, in the likeness of Polites, begins to"
8826,[490] P. 585.,"address Priam, and we do not hear of any other business. So, when"
8827,[490] P. 585.,"Idæus came back from the Greeks, he found the Trojan Assembly still"
8828,[490] P. 585.,sitting. All this looks as if the entire business of administering the
8829,[490] P. 585.,government rested with that body only.
8830,[490] P. 585.,
8831,[490] P. 585.,I draw a similar inference from the remarkable expression in Il. ii.
8832,[490] P. 585.,"788, ἀγορὰς ἀγόρευον. This seems to express that there was a standing,"
8833,[490] P. 585.,"probably a daily, assembly of the Trojans, not formally summoned, and"
8834,[490] P. 585.,"open to all comers, which acted as the governing body for the state."
8835,[490] P. 585.,"The line would then mean, not simply ‘the Trojans were holding an"
8836,[490] P. 585.,"assembly,’ but ‘the Trojans were holding their assembly as usual.’"
8837,[490] P. 585.,
8838,[490] P. 585.,The names βουλευτὴς and ἀγορητὴς appear to have been merely
8839,[490] P. 585.,"descriptive, and not titular. Both are applied to the Trojan elders."
8840,[490] P. 585.,
8841,[490] P. 585.,"And so βουλαὶ, βουλεύειν, βουληφόροι, are constantly used without any,"
8842,[490] P. 585.,"so to speak, official meaning. In Il. x. 147, the expression βουλὰς"
8843,[490] P. 585.,"βουλεύειν can hardly mean ‘to attend the βουλὴ,’ for the singular"
8844,[490] P. 585.,number would be the proper term for the βουλὴ specially convoked: and
8845,[490] P. 585.,"I interpret it as meaning, to attend at or to hold the usual council."
8846,[490] P. 585.,"This is among the Greeks. Among the Trojans, in Il. x. 415-17, Dolon"
8847,[490] P. 585.,"says,"
8848,[490] P. 585.,
8849,[490] P. 585.,"Ἕκτωρ μὲν μετὰ τοῖσιν, ὅσοι βουληφόροι εἰσὶν,"
8850,[490] P. 585.,"βουλὰς βουλεύει θείου παρὰ σήματι Ἴλου,"
8851,[490] P. 585.,νόσφιν ἀπὸ φλοίσβου.
8852,[490] P. 585.,
8853,[490] P. 585.,"Now the word βουληφόρος is applied, Il. xii. 414, to Sarpedon, as well"
8854,[490] P. 585.,as in xiii. 463 and elsewhere to Æneas. Neither were among the γέροντες
8855,[490] P. 585.,"βουλευταί. But further, it is applied, Od. ix. 112, to the ἀγορὴ itself:"
8856,[490] P. 585.,
8857,[490] P. 585.,"τοῖσιν δ’ οὔτ’ ἀγοραὶ βουληφόροι, οὔτε θέμιστες"
8858,[490] P. 585.,
8859,[490] P. 585.,"And therefore the word, though it means councillor in a general sense,"
8860,[490] P. 585.,"does not mean officially member of a βουλὴ, as opposed to an ἀγορὴ or"
8861,[490] P. 585.,Assembly.
8862,[490] P. 585.,
8863,[490] P. 585.,"The phrase βουλὰς βουλεύει, in the passage Il. x. 415-17, does not"
8864,[490] P. 585.,"oppose, but supports what has now been said. It is quite plain that"
8865,[490] P. 585.,"this of Hector’s was a small military meeting, or council of war,"
8866,[490] P. 585.,"just as in viii. 489 he held an ἀγορὴ, or assembly of the army, both"
8867,[490] P. 585.,"Trojans and allies; it was not a meeting of a βουλὴ of Troy, because"
8868,[490] P. 585.,"it was held in the field, far from the city, and without any of the"
8869,[490] P. 585.,"Elders, who were the great ἀγορηταὶ and βουλευταὶ of Troy; for Hector"
8870,[490] P. 585.,had already arranged (Il. viii. 517-19) that the old men should remain
8871,[490] P. 585.,"in the city, to defend the walls from any night attack: most of all"
8872,[490] P. 585.,"however because, as we hear of no βουλὴ before the military Assembly"
8873,[490] P. 585.,"in the Eighth Book, so we hear of no Assembly following the meeting"
8874,[490] P. 585.,for deliberation in the Tenth. Generals in modern times hold councils
8875,[490] P. 585.,"of war: but no parallel can be drawn between them, and Councils for"
8876,[490] P. 585.,dispatching the affairs of a State.
8877,[490] P. 585.,
8878,[490] P. 585.,As we never have occasion to become acquainted with Trojan politics in
8879,[490] P. 585.,"peace, we can only argue the case as to the nonexistence of a council"
8880,[490] P. 585.,"from the state of war. But in Greece, it will be remembered, both war"
8881,[490] P. 585.,"and peace present their cases of the use of this institution, as one"
8882,[490] P. 585.,"regularly established, and apparently invested with both a deliberative"

8900,[490] P. 585.,A more remarkable example is afforded by the second Trojan Assembly
8901,[490] P. 585.,"(Il. vii. 345-379). For this ἀγορὴ is described as δεινὴ, τετρηχυῖα;"
8902,[490] P. 585.,"and well it might be, in circumstances so arduous. The Elders in the"
8903,[490] P. 585.,"Third Book were of opinion that, beautiful as Helen was, it was better"
8904,[490] P. 585.,"to restore her, than to continue the sufferings and dangers of the"
8905,[490] P. 585.,"war. Accordingly, Antenor urged in this Assembly that she should be"
8906,[490] P. 585.,"restored, together with the plundered property. He referred also to the"
8907,[490] P. 585.,"recent breach of a sworn covenant on the Trojan side, and said no good"
8908,[490] P. 585.,could come of it. This he effects in a speech of six lines; the first
8909,[490] P. 585.,"of which is the mere vocative address to the Assembly, and the last is"
8910,[490] P. 585.,marked as surplusage with the _obelos_ (348-53).

8912,[490] P. 585.,"Paris, the person mainly concerned, replies. He does not address"

8914,[490] P. 585.,subject of debate in eight lines (357-64). Four of them are given to
8915,[490] P. 585.,"the announcement of his intentions, and four to abuse of Antenor."

8920,[490] P. 585.,"then arose, and in a speech of eleven lines (368-78) laid down another"
8921,[490] P. 585.,"plan of proceeding, namely, by a message to the Greeks for a truce with"

8928,[490] P. 585.,deliberation in the conduct of business: though Glaucus tells his story

8930,[490] P. 585.,"and Æneas to Achilles (Il. xx. 199-258) nearly equals him. Indeed, it"

8940,[490] P. 585.,"(Il. iii. 151, 2), a clear trill or thread of voice, not only without"
8941,[490] P. 585.,"any particular idea of length attached to it, but apparently meant"
8942,[490] P. 585.,to recall a sharp intermittent chirp. Yet there is an odd proof that
8943,[490] P. 585.,"to Priam at least, as one of these old men, there was attached, by"
8944,[490] P. 585.,"the younger ones, the imputation of favouring either too many or else"
8945,[490] P. 585.,"too long orations. For, in the ἀγορὴ of the Second Book, Iris in the"
8946,[490] P. 585.,"character of Polites, though there is no account of what had preceded"
8947,[490] P. 585.,"her arrival, objurgates Priam as both then encouraging what may be"

8970,[490] P. 585.,"speaks, however, of νόος and βουλὴ, mind and counsel[510]; he does not"
8971,[490] P. 585.,drop a word relating to public speech or to eloquence as instruments of

9032,[490] P. 585.,"the wagons: but, he adds, there was silence among the Trojans,"
9033,[490] P. 585.,
9034,[490] P. 585.,οὐδ’ εἴα κλαίειν Πρίαμος μέγας·
9035,[490] P. 585.,
9036,[490] P. 585.,and it was because the king had felt that there would be indecency in a
9037,[490] P. 585.,noisy show of sorrow: while the Greeks needed not the injunction (Il.
9038,[490] P. 585.,"vii. 426-32), from their spontaneous self-command."
9039,[490] P. 585.,
9040,[490] P. 585.,When the Poet speaks of the Trojan Assembly in the Seventh Book as
9041,[490] P. 585.,"δεινὴ τετρηχυῖα, he evidently means to describe an excitement tending"
9042,[490] P. 585.,to disorder: and one contrasted in a remarkable manner with the
9043,[490] P. 585.,"discipline of the Greeks, who were summoned to meet silently in the"
9044,[490] P. 585.,"night, that they might not, in gathering, arouse the enemy outside the"
9045,[490] P. 585.,"ramparts. Even in their respective modes of expressing approbation,"
9046,[490] P. 585.,"Homer makes a shade of difference. When the Greeks applaud, it is"
9047,[490] P. 585.,"ἐπίαχον υἷες Ἀχαιῶν, or what we call loud or vehement cheering: but"
9048,[490] P. 585.,"when the Trojans, it is ἐπὶ δὲ Τρῶες κελάδησαν, which signifies a more"
9049,[490] P. 585.,miscellaneous and tumultuous noise.
9050,[490] P. 585.,
9051,[490] P. 585.,"In short, it would appear to be the intention of Homer to represent"
9052,[490] P. 585.,the Greeks as possessed of a higher intelligence throughout. In the
9053,[490] P. 585.,"Odyssey, we find that Ulysses made his way into Troy disguised as"
9054,[490] P. 585.,"a beggar, communicated with Helen, duly informed himself (κατὰ δὲ"
9055,[490] P. 585.,"φρόνιν ἤγαγε πολλήν[514]), and contrived to despatch certain of the"
9056,[490] P. 585.,Trojans before he departed. In the Iliad we are supplied with abundant
9057,[490] P. 585.,"instances of the superior management of the Greeks, and likewise of"
9058,[490] P. 585.,"their auxiliary gods, in comparison with those of the Trojans. Juno"
9059,[490] P. 585.,"outwits Venus in obtaining from her the cestus, and then proceeds"
9060,[490] P. 585.,"to outwit Jupiter in the use of it. Minerva, on observing that the"
9061,[490] P. 585.,"Greeks are losing, (Il. vii. 17) betakes herself to Troy, where Apollo"
9062,[490] P. 585.,"proposes just what she wants, namely, a cessation of the general"
9063,[490] P. 585.,"engagement, with a view to a personal encounter between Hector and some"
9064,[490] P. 585.,chosen chieftain: she immediately adopts the plan; and he causes it to
9065,[490] P. 585.,be executed through Helenus. It both stops the general havoc among the
9066,[490] P. 585.,"Greeks, and redounds greatly to the honour of their champion Ajax. At"
9067,[490] P. 585.,"the end of the day, however, Nestor suggests to the Greek chiefs, on"
9068,[490] P. 585.,"account of their heavy losses (Il. vii. 328), that they should, on the"
9069,[490] P. 585.,"occasion of raising a mound over their dead, likewise dig and fortify"
9070,[490] P. 585.,"a trench, which might serve to defend the ships and camp. In the mean"
9071,[490] P. 585.,time the Trojans are made to meet; and they send to propose the very
9072,[490] P. 585.,"measure, namely, an armistice for funeral rites, which the Greeks"
9073,[490] P. 585.,"desire, in order, under cover of it, to fortify themselves (Il. vii."
9074,[490] P. 585.,368-97). And this accordingly Agamemnon is enabled to grant as a sort
9075,[490] P. 585.,of favour to the Trojans (Il. vii. 408):

9080,[490] P. 585.,
9081,[490] P. 585.,This superior intelligence is probably meant to be figured by the
9082,[490] P. 585.,"exchange of arms between Glaucus and Diomed. And, again, when Hector"
9083,[490] P. 585.,"attempts anything in the nature of a stratagem, as the mission of"
9084,[490] P. 585.,"Dolon by night, it is only that he may fall into the hands of Diomed"
9085,[490] P. 585.,and Ulysses. But there does not appear to be in any of these cases
9086,[490] P. 585.,"a violation of oath, compact, or any absolute rule of equity by the"
9087,[490] P. 585.,Greeks.
9088,[490] P. 585.,
9089,[490] P. 585.,"Of all these traits, however, it may be said, that they are of no"
9090,[490] P. 585.,"value as evidence, if taken by themselves. They are means which would"
9091,[490] P. 585.,"obviously occur to the Poet, zealous for his own nation. It is their"
9092,[490] P. 585.,"accordance with other indications, apparently undesigned, which"
9093,[490] P. 585.,"warrants our relying upon them as real testimonies, available for an"
9094,[490] P. 585.,historic purpose.

9099,[490] P. 585.,"among the Trojans than the Greeks, yet in certain points also their"
9100,[490] P. 585.,usages were more primitive and simple. Thus we find the youths of the
9101,[490] P. 585.,"house of Nestor immediately about his person; and Patroclus, as well"
9102,[490] P. 585.,"as Achilles, was apparently brought up at the court of Peleus. Again,"
9103,[490] P. 585.,the youthful Nestor travels into Thessaly for a campaign: Ulysses
9104,[490] P. 585.,goes to hunt at the Court of his grandfather Autolycus. The Ithacan
9105,[490] P. 585.,Suitors employ themselves in manly games. But we frequently come upon
9106,[490] P. 585.,"passages where we are incidentally informed, that the princes of the"
9107,[490] P. 585.,"house of Dardanus were occupied in rustic employments. Thus Melanippus,"
9108,[490] P. 585.,"son of Hiketaon, and cousin of Hector, who was residing in Priam’s"
9109,[490] P. 585.,"palace, and treated as one of his children, had before the war tended"
9110,[490] P. 585.,"oxen in Percote[515]. Æneas, the only son and heir of Anchises, had"
9111,[490] P. 585.,"been similarly occupied among or near the hills, at the time when he"
9112,[490] P. 585.,"had a narrow escape from capture by Achilles[516]. Lycaon, son of"
9113,[490] P. 585.,"Priam, was cutting the branches of the wild fig for the fellies of"
9114,[490] P. 585.,chariot-wheels when Achilles took him for the second time: on the first
9115,[490] P. 585.,"occasion, he had been at work in a vineyard[517]. Antiphos and Isos,"
9116,[490] P. 585.,"sons of Priam, had been captured by Achilles whilst they were acting"
9117,[490] P. 585.,"as shepherds[518]. Anchises was acting as a herdsman, when he formed"
9118,[490] P. 585.,"his connection with Venus[519]. The name of Boucolion, an illegitimate"
9119,[490] P. 585.,"son of Laomedon, seems to indicate that he was bred for the like"

9166,[490] P. 585.,"the particularity of some of the inferences that have been drawn, I"
9167,[490] P. 585.,venture to hope few will quit the subject without the conviction that
9168,[490] P. 585.,"Homer has worked with the purpose and precision which are his wont, in"
9169,[490] P. 585.,the diversities which mark the general outline of his Greeks and his
9170,[490] P. 585.,"Trojans, and of the institutions of each respectively; and that he has"
9171,[490] P. 585.,"not altogether withheld from his national portraits the care, which he"
9172,[490] P. 585.,is admitted to have applied to his individual characters on both sides
9173,[490] P. 585.,with such extraordinary success. If we look to the institutions of the
9174,[490] P. 585.,"two countries, although the comparison is diversified, we must upon"
9175,[490] P. 585.,"the whole concede to the Greeks, that they had laid more firmly than"
9176,[490] P. 585.,"their adversaries those great corner stones of human society, which are"
9177,[490] P. 585.,"named in their language, θέμις, ὅρκος, and γάμος. In the polity of Troy"
9178,[490] P. 585.,"we find more scope for impulse, less for deliberation and persuasion;"
9179,[490] P. 585.,more weight given to those elements of authority which do not depend
9180,[490] P. 585.,"on our free will and intelligence, less to those which do; less of"
9181,[490] P. 585.,"organization and of diversity, less firmness and tenacity of tissue, in"
9182,[490] P. 585.,"the structure of the community. We are told of no φῦλα and no φρῆτραι,"
9183,[490] P. 585.,no intermediate ranks of officers in the army; no order of nobles or
9184,[490] P. 585.,"proprietors, such as that which furnished the Suitors of Ithaca. There"
9185,[490] P. 585.,"are, in short, fewer secondary eminences; it is a state of things, more"
9186,[490] P. 585.,resembling the dead level of the present Oriental communities subject
9187,[490] P. 585.,"to a despotic throne, though such was not the throne of Priam. Among"
9188,[490] P. 585.,"the people themselves, there is more of religious observance and"
9189,[490] P. 585.,"apparatus, but not more of morality: less tendency indeed to crimes"

9193,[490] P. 585.,would they have been induced to bleed. But if they had engendered
9194,[490] P. 585.,"such a creature, they would not have paid the penalty: for man in"

9211,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9212,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9213,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,The legendary Geography of the Odyssey may in one sense be compared
9214,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"with that of Ariosto, and that of Bojardo. I should be the first,"
9215,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"indeed, to admit that a disquisition, having for its object to"
9216,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"establish the delimitation of the Geography of either of those poets,"
9217,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"and to fix its relation to the actual surface of the earth, was but"
9218,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"labour thrown away. For two thousand years, however, perhaps for more,"
9219,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the Geography of the Odyssey has been a subject of interest and of
9220,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"controversy. In entering upon that field I ask myself, why the case of"
9221,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Homer is in this respect so different from that of the great Italian
9222,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"romancers? It is not only that, great as they were, we are dealing with"
9223,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,one before whom their greatness dwindles into comparative littleness.
9224,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Nor is it only, though it seems to be in part, because the adventures"
9225,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of Ulysses are, or appear to be, much more strictly bound up with"
9226,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"place, than those of Orlando, Rinaldo, or Ruggiero. The difference, I"
9227,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"think, mainly lies in this, that an intense earnestness accompanies"
9228,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Homer every where, even through his wild and noble romance. Cooped up"
9229,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"as he was within a narrow and local circle--for such it was, though"
9230,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,it was for so many centuries the centre of the whole greatness of the
9231,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,world--here is his effort to pass the horizon ‘by strength of thought;’
9232,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to pierce the mist; to shape the dim, confused, and conflicting"
9233,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"reports he could pick up, according to the best of his knowledge and"
9234,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"belief, into land and sea; to people its habitable spots with the"
9235,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"scanty material he could command, every where enlarged, made good, and"
9236,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"adorned out of the wealth of his vigorous imagination; and to form,"
9237,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"by effort of the brain, for the first time as far as we know in the"
9238,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"history of our race, an idea of a certain configuration for the surface"
9239,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,of the Earth.
9240,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9241,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Hence, perhaps, may have flowed the potency of the charm, which has"
9242,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"attended the subject of Homer’s Outer Geography. The subject has,"
9243,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"however, in my belief, its utility too. It is rarely otherwise than"
9244,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,well worth while to trace even the erroneous thoughts of powerful
9245,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"minds. But, moreover, in the present instance, I apprehend we can"
9246,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"learn, through the Outer Geography of Homer, important and interesting"
9247,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"matter of history, which is not to be learned from any other source."
9248,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,For the Poet has embedded into his imaginative scheme a multitude of
9249,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"real geographical and physical traditions; and by means of these, upon"
9250,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"comparing them with their proper originals, we can judge with tolerable"
9251,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,accuracy what were the limits of human enterprise on the face of earth
9252,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,in the heroic age.
9253,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9254,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"The question before us is, what map of the earth did Homer shape in"
9255,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"his own mind, that he might adjust to it the voyages and tours of his"
9256,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"heroes Menelaus and Ulysses, particularly the latter? And in order to a"
9257,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,legitimate inquiry the first step to be taken is negative. Do not let
9258,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,us engage in the vain attempt to construct the Geography of the Odyssey
9259,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,upon the basis of the actual distribution of the earth’s surface. Such
9260,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,a process can lead to no satisfactory result. Whatever materials Homer
9261,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"may have obtained to assist him, we must consider as so many atoms;"
9262,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"I speak of course, as to all that lay beyond the narrow sphere of his"
9263,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Greek knowledge and experience. He had no adequate means of placing
9264,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the different parts of the accounts which reached him in their true
9265,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,geographical relations to one another. The outer world was for him
9266,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"broken up into fragments, and these fragments were rearranged at his"
9267,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"pleasure, with the aid of such lights only, as his limited physical"

9276,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9277,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"1. Has Homer two modes of dealing with the subject of locality,"
9278,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"considered at large? if so, can it be shown that he applies them to two"
9279,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,distinct geographical regions; one the circumscribed central tract of
9280,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"land and sea within which he lived, the other a wider and larger zone,"
9281,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,which lay beyond it in all directions; and can a line be drawn with

9283,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,accordingly?
9284,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9285,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"2. If it be established that Homer has a system of Outer Geography,"
9286,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"severed by a sufficiently-defined barrier from his Inner Geography,"
9287,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"then are there any, and if so what, keys, or leading ideas of local"
9288,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"arrangement for the former scheme, which, themselves derived from the"
9289,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"evidence of his text, should be used for the adjustment of its details?"
9290,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9291,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"3. Under the system thus ascertained, what was the route of Menelaus,"
9292,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"and more especially of Ulysses, as these presented themselves to the"
9293,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,mind of Homer?
9294,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9295,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"I set out from the proposition, which, as I conceive, rests upon"
9296,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"universal consent, that within a certain sphere the poems may be"
9297,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,considered as a record of experimental geography; and one sometimes
9298,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"carried down into detail with so much of accuracy, that it embraces"
9299,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"even the miniature of that branch of knowledge, to which we usually"
9300,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,give the name of topography.
9301,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9302,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"By way of example for the former, I should say that when Homer"
9303,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"describes the Bœotian towns, when he measures the distance over the"
9304,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Ægean, nay, when he makes Ulysses represent that he floated in ten"
9305,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"days from some point near Crete to the Thesprotian coast, he is a"
9306,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"geographer. Again, in his variously estimated account of the interior"
9307,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of Ithaca, he is a topographer. He is the same on the whole, though"
9308,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"probably with greater license, when he is dealing with the Plain of"
9309,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Troy.
9310,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9311,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,~_The two spheres of Geography._~
9312,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9313,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"In speaking of the experimental geography of Homer, of course I do"
9314,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"not intend to imply that he had, even within his narrow sphere, the"
9315,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,means that later science has afforded of establishing situations and
9316,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,distances with absolute precision. He could only proceed by the far
9317,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"ruder testimony of the senses, trained in the school of experience."
9318,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Neither do I mean that the experience was in every case his own, though"
9319,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to a great extent his geographical information was probably original,"
9320,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,and acquired by him principally in the exercise of his profession as an
9321,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"itinerating Bard. But by the experimental and real geography of Homer,"
9322,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"I mean these two things; first, that the Poet believed himself to be"
9323,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,describing _pro tanto_ points upon the earth’s surface as they actually
9324,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"were; secondly, that his means of information were for practical"
9325,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,purposes adequate. The evidence of the passage containing the simile of
9326,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the Thought (Il. xv. 580) would suffice, were there none other, to show"
9327,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,that he was himself a traveller; he also lived among a people already
9328,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"accustomed to travel, and familiar with the navigation of a certain"
9329,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,portion of the earth’s surface. In a former part of this work I have
9330,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,given several instances to illustrate the disposition of the early
9331,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Greeks with respect to travel[525]. A people of habits like theirs was
9332,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,well qualified to supply a practical system of geography for the whole
9333,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,sphere with which it was habitually conversant.
9334,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9335,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"[525] Achæis, or Ethnology; sect. vii. p. 336."
9336,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9337,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,But the boldness and maturity of navigation may be measured pretty
9338,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,nearly by the length of its voyages. The geographical particulars of
9339,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the Wanderings, however dislocated and distorted, show us that the"
9340,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,people who had supplied them had acquired a considerable acquaintance
9341,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"with all the waters within, and probably also, nay, I should be"
9342,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"disposed to say certainly, some that were without, the Straits of"
9343,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Gibraltar. But in all the poems of Homer we find the traces of Greek
9344,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"knowledge and resort become fainter and fainter, as we pass beyond"
9345,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"certain points. On the Greek Peninsula, to the south of the Ambracian"
9346,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"gulf on the west and of Mount Olympus on the east, we have the signs"
9347,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,of a constant intercourse to and fro. The same tokens extend to the
9348,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"islands immediately surrounding it, and reaching at least as far as"
9349,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Crete. Indeed, apart from particular signs, we may say that, without"
9350,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"familiar and frequent intercourse among the members that composed it,"
9351,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the empire of Agamemnon could not have subsisted.
9352,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9353,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"But, at certain distances, the mode of geographical handling becomes"
9354,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"faint, mistrustful, and indistinct. Distances are misstated, or cease"
9355,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,to be stated at all. The names of countries are massed together in such
9356,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,a way as to show that the Poet had no idea of a particular mode of
9357,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"juxtaposition for them. Topographical or local features, of a character"
9358,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,such as to identify a description with some particular place or
9359,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"region as its prototype in nature, are erroneously transposed to some"
9360,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"situation which, from general indications, we can see must be upon a"
9361,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"different and perhaps distant part of the surface of the globe. Again,"
9362,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"by ceasing to define distances and directions, he shows from time to"
9363,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"time that he has lost confidence in his own collocation, that he is"
9364,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"not willing to challenge a comparison with actual nature, and that,"
9365,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"from want of accurate knowledge, he feels he must seek some degree of"
9366,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,shelter in generalities.
9367,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9368,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"It is obvious that, under the circumstances as they have thus far been"
9369,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"delineated, the geography of the poems, with a centre fixed for it"
9370,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"somewhere in Greece, say at Olympus or Mycenæ, might be first of all"
9371,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"divided into three zones, ranging around that centre. The first and"
9372,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,innermost would be that of the familiar knowledge and experience of
9373,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,his countrymen. The second would be that of their rare and occasional
9374,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"resort. The third would be a region wholly unknown to them, and with"
9375,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"respect to which they were wholly dependent on foreign, that is on"
9376,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Phœnician, report; much as a Roman, five hundred years ago, would"
9377,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,practically depend upon the reports of Venetians and Genoese mariners
9378,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,for all or nearly all his ultra-marine knowledge.
9379,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9380,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Now, though we may not be able to mark positively at every point of the"
9381,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,compass the particular spot at which we step from the first zone to the
9382,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"second, and from the second to the third, yet there is enough of the"
9383,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,second zone discernible to make it serve for an effectual delimitation
9384,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,between the first and the third; between the region of experience and
9385,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"that of marvel; of foreign, arbitrary, unchecked, and semifabulous"
9386,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,report. Just as we are unable to fix the moment at which night passes
9387,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"into dawn, and dawn into day; but yet the dawn of morning, and the"
9388,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,twilight of evening are themselves the lines which broadly separate
9389,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"between the day and the night, lying respectively at the extremities of"
9390,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"each. So with the poems of Homer, it may be a question whether a given"
9391,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"place, say Phœnicia, is in the first or the second zone; or whether"
9392,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"some other, such as Scheria, or as the Bosphorus, is in the second or"
9393,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the third; but it will never be difficult to affirm of any important
9394,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,place named in the poems _either_ that it is not in the zone of common
9395,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"experience, or else that it is not in the zone of foreign fable."
9396,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9397,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,~_Limits of the Inner Geography._~
9398,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9399,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Let me now endeavour to draw the lines, which thus far have been laid"
9400,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,down only in principle.
9401,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9402,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"1. And first it seems plain, that the experimental knowledge of Homer"
9403,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,extended over the whole of the continental territory embraced within
9404,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the Greek Catalogue, including, along with the continent, those islands"
9405,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"which he has classed with his mainland, and not in his separate insular"
9406,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,group[526].
9407,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9408,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,[526] Il. ii. 645-80.
9409,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9410,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,2. It may be slightly doubtful whether he had a similar knowledge of
9411,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the islands forming the base of the Ægean. There is a peculiarity in
9412,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the Cretan description (Il. ii. 645-52), namely, that after enumerating"
9413,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"certain cities he closes with general words (649),"
9414,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9415,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"ἄλλοι θ’, οἳ Κρήτην ἑκατόμπολιν ἀμφενέμοντο."
9416,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9417,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Still he uses characteristic epithets: and in another place (Od. xiv.
9418,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"257), he defines (of course by time) the distance from Crete to Egypt."
9419,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"So again in Rhodes (656), Camirus has the characteristic epithet of"
9420,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,ἀργινόεις. On the whole we may place this division within the first
9421,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,zone of Homeric geography.
9422,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9423,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,3. Homer would appear to have had an accurate knowledge of the
9424,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"positions of the islands of Lemnos, Samothrace, Imbros, Lesbos, Samos,"
9425,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"and Chios[527]. These we may consider, without further detail, as"
9426,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,answering practically for the whole Ægean sea.
9427,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9428,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"[527] Il. xiv. 225-30. xiii. 10-16, 33. xiv. 281. xxiv. 78, 753, 434."
9429,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Od. iii. 169-72.
9430,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9431,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"4. Homer knew the positions of Emathia and Pieria, relatively to one"
9432,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,another and to Greece; and the general course of the southern ranges of
9433,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the Thracian mountains[528]. The Trojan Catalogue appears to show that
9434,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"he also knew the coast-line westward from the Dardanelles, as far as"
9435,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to the river Axius. There we may consider that his Pieria begins, with"
9436,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Greece upon its southern and western border.
9437,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9438,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,[528] Il. xiv. 225-30. Od. v. 50.
9439,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9440,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,5. It would appear that Homer had a pretty full knowledge of the
9441,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,southern coast-line of the Propontis. He seems to place the Thracians
9442,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of the Trojan Catalogue on the northern side of that sea, but his"
9443,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,language is quite general with respect to this part of it. On the south
9444,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"side, however, and in the whole north-western corner of Asia Minor,"
9445,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,we appear to find him at home[529]. Thus much we may safely conclude
9446,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,from the detail of the Trojan Catalogue; from the particular account
9447,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,of the Idæan rivers in the Twelfth Iliad[530]; from the latter part
9448,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,of the journey of Juno in the Fourteenth[531]; and from the speech of
9449,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Achilles in the Twenty-fourth[532], which fixes the position of Phrygia"
9450,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,relatively to Troy.
9451,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9452,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,[529] Forbiger thinks he knew the southern coast of the Black sea to a
9453,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"certain extent. Handbuch der Alten Geographie, sect. 4. p. 10."

9460,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9461,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"6. From the point of Lectum to the southward, Homer shows a knowledge"
9462,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,of the coast-line as far as Lycia in the south-western quarter of Asia
9463,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Minor. But here we must close his inner sphere. The Solyman mountains
9464,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,supply the only local notice in the poems which can be said to belong
9465,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to the interior country, and of these his conceptions are evidently as"
9466,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,far as possible from geographical. In the Sixth Iliad[533] he appears
9467,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,to conceive of the Solyman people as bordering upon Lycia. Although
9468,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the name has suggested to some a connection with Jerusalem, we ought"
9469,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to consider it as representing that for which it stands in geography,"
9470,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,a part of the grand inland mass of Asiatic mountains. But from the
9471,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"proximity of the Solymi to Lycia, Homer would appear to have moved them"
9472,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"greatly westward. Again, when Neptune in the Fifth Odyssey sees Ulysses"
9473,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"from the Solyman mountains on his way from Ogygia, we must suppose"
9474,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,that Homer conceived them to command some point of a neighbouring and
9475,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"continuous line of sea, which would allow of such a prospect. He would"
9476,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"hardly have made Neptune see Ulysses from Lycia, or from a point across"
9477,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the mountains of Thrace, or from one on the other side of the actual"
9478,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Mount Taurus.

9480,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,[533] Il. vi. 184.
9481,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9482,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"We have now, I think, made the circuit of the whole zone, and it is a"
9483,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"small one, of the real or experimental geography of Homer."
9484,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9485,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,~_The intermediate or doubtful Zone._~
9486,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9487,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Let us take next the intermediate zone, which marks the extreme and"
9488,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,infrequent points of Greek resort.
9489,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9490,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Beginning in the west and north-west, we have found Sicania (now Upper"
9491,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Calabria), Epirus, and the country of the Thesprotians[534], marking"
9492,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the points of this intermediate region. To the northward, we may"
9493,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"fix it at Emathia. In the north-east, it seems to be bounded by the"
9494,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,northern shore of the Sea of Marmora. The Thracians of Homer inhabit a
9495,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"country which he calls ἐριβώλαξ, Il. xx. 485, and which the Hellespont"
9496,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"enclosed (ἐέργει), that is to say, washes on two sides at least. The"
9497,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Hellespont, as in this place it is termed ἀγάῤῥοος, signifies to the"
9498,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Eastern part of its waters in particular; and the name probably
9499,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,includes the Propontis (which he might well suppose to have a strong
9500,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"current throughout, like the Straits of Gallipoli), together with the"
9501,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,northern Ægean between Chalcidice and the Thracian Chersonese. He has
9502,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"described these Thracians in very vague terms[535], and without any"
9503,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"local circumstance, in the Catalogue: but the form of the coast-line"
9504,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"apparently implied in the word ἐέργει, and the epithet of fertility,"
9505,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,appear to indicate the plain of Adrianople and the Maritz. But this
9506,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,inclosure on two sides terminates when the northern shore begins to
9507,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"trend directly to the eastward: and the Πλαγκταὶ, or Bosphorus, which"
9508,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"no man but Jason ever succeeded in passing, are to be considered as in"
9509,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the zone of a semifabulous or exterior chorography.

9514,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9515,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"When we pass into the south-east, we find that Cyprus, Phœnicia, and"
9516,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Egypt may perhaps most properly be placed in the doubtful zone. We have
9517,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"seen that Cyprus was known as a stage on the passage to the East, and"
9518,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,as within the possible military reach of Agamemnon. But its lord did
9519,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"not join in the war: and Homer has no details about the island, beyond"
9520,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the specification of Paphos as the seat of the residence, and of the"
9521,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"principal worship, of Venus."
9522,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9523,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,We have no instance of any visit paid by Greeks to Phœnicia under
9524,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"ordinary circumstances. The tour of Menelaus is, like that of Ulysses,"
9525,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,outside the sphere of ordinary life. He describes himself in it to
9526,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Telemachus as πολλὰ παθὼν καὶ πόλλ’ ἐπαληθεὶς[536], which may be"
9527,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,compared with Od. i. 4. respecting Ulysses. We hear of the Taphians
9528,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,there; for it was at Sidon that they kidnapped the nurse of Eumæus.
9529,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Piracy in those times probably reached somewhat further than trade.
9530,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,These same Taphians appear to be of doubtful Hellenism. On the one
9531,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"hand, Mentes their leader was a ξεῖνος to Ulysses[537]. But (1) we thus"
9532,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"find them in Phœnicia[538], which is not a place of usual Greek resort."
9533,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"(2) They sail to Temese in foreign parts, ἐπ’ ἀλλοθρόους ἀνθρώπους (Od."
9534,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"i. 183), which we do not find elsewhere said of Greeks. The case of"
9535,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the pseudo-Ulysses cannot stand as a precedent for the rest of Greece,"
9536,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,nor even for the rest of Crete[539]. (3) The father of Mentes had
9537,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"given Ulysses poison for his arrows, which Ilus, the Hellene, had from"
9538,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,motives of religion refused him. This at once supplies a particular
9539,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"reason for the xenial bond between them, and suggests that this Taphian"
9540,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"prince may have been, though a ξεῖνος, yet of a different religion and"
9541,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"race. (4) The absence of the Taphians from the war, especially as a"
9542,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"tribe so much given to navigation, further strengthens the presumption"
9543,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,that they were not properly Greeks.

9554,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"world, and belongs to the intermediate zone. Yet more decidedly is"
9555,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"this the case with Egypt. For Ulysses means something unusual, when"
9556,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,he describes the voyage as one lasting for five days across the open
9557,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"sea, even with the very best wind all the way, from Crete; and it is"
9558,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,elsewhere described as at a distance formidably great. Such is the idea
9559,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"apparently intended by the statement, that the very birds do but make"
9560,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the journey once a year over so vast a sea[540]. No ordinary Greek ever
9561,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"goes to Egypt: and when the pseudo-Ulysses planned his voyage thither,"
9562,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"it was under a sinister impulse from Jupiter, who meant him ill[541]:"

9570,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Again, the Poet appears to have entirely misconceived the distance"

9572,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,meaning probably by that name the Nile. Vain attempts have been made to
9573,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,get rid by explanation of this geographical error. Nitzsch[542] says
9574,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"truly, that for the geography of this passage Homer was dependent on"
9575,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the gossip of sailors, and compares it with that of Ogygia, Scheria,"
9576,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"and the rest. When Menelaus went to Egypt, it was involuntarily, as we"

9588,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Homer was either the great River Ocean, or else the land immediately"
9589,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"bordering upon it. Their inner line, that is, the line nearest to the"
9590,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"known Greek or Homeric world, may be defined by a number of points"
9591,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"specified in the poems. We have, for example, the Lotophagi and Libya"
9592,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"in the south; the land of the Cyclops on the west; (I pass by Sicily,"
9593,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"because it can, I think, be shown, that Homer transplanted it into"
9594,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"another quarter;) Scheria to the north-west, the Abii, Glactophagi,"
9595,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"and Hippemolgi, to the north. Then come the Strait of the Πλαγκταὶ, or"
9596,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Bosphorus, pretty accurately conceived as to its site; next towards"
9597,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the east, the Amazons and the Solymi with their mountains; in the"
9598,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"south-east the Ἐρεμβοὶ, and then the widely spread Αἰθίοπες. All the"
9599,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"places and people visited by Ulysses after the Lotophagi, that have not"

9601,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9602,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,I have now explained the grounds on which I assume the existence
9603,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of two great zones, the one of a real, the other of an imaginative,"
9604,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"fluctuating, and semi-fabulous Geography in Homer; and of a third zone,"

9608,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9609,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,I come now to consider what are the keys or leading ideas of local
9610,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,arrangement which we can first obtain from the particulars of the Outer
9611,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Geography of Homer, and which we may then apply to the solution of such"
9612,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,questions of detail as it presents.
9613,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9614,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,It is plain that we have real need of some such keys. To ascertain the
9615,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"general direction of the movements of the Wanderings of Ulysses, and"
9616,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the general idea entertained by the Poet of the distribution of land
9617,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"and sea, is an essential preliminary to the solution of such questions"
9618,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"as, Where were the Sirens? or, Where were the Læstrygones? According to"
9619,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the statement I have recently given, many of the points, that Ulysses"
9620,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"in the Wanderings visited by sea, would appear to have been so fixed by"
9621,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Homer, as to imply his belief that the chieftain sailed over what we"
9622,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,know to be the European continent.
9623,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9624,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"The two propositions, which I have already ventured to state as being"
9625,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the keys to the Outer Geography of the Odyssey, are in the following"
9626,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,terms[544]:
9627,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9628,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"[544] See Ethnology, sect. iv. p. 304."
9629,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9630,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"1. That Homer placed to the northward of Thrace, Epirus, and the"
9631,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Italian peninsula, an expanse, not of land, but of sea, communicating"
9632,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"with the Euxine; or, to express myself in other words, that he greatly"
9633,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"extended the Euxine westwards, perhaps also shortening it towards"
9634,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the East; and that he made it communicate, by the gulfs of Genoa and"
9635,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Venice, with the southern Mediterranean."
9636,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9637,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,2. That he compounded into one two sets of Phœnician traditions
9638,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"respecting the Ocean-mouth, and fixed the site of it in the North-East."
9639,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9640,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"In the first place, I assume that it would be a waste of time to enter"
9641,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"upon an elaborate confutation of the traditional identifications, which"
9642,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the pardonable ambition of after-times has devised for the various
9643,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"points of the wanderings. According to those expository figments,"
9644,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"we must believe that the land of the Cyclops is an island, that it"
9645,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"is the same island which reappears at a later date as Thrinacie,"
9646,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"that Æolia is Stromboli in sight of that island of the Cyclops,"
9647,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,(though it took Ulysses nine days of fair wind to sail from it to
9648,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"within sight of Ithaca,) and that Ulysses could sail straight across"
9649,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the sea from Æolia to Ithaca. We must look for the Læstrygones and
9650,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,their perpetual day in the latitudes of the Mediterranean. We must
9651,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"either place the ocean northward, (but wholly without any prototype"
9652,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"in nature,) and the under-world on the west coast of Italy, where"
9653,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"there is no stream whatever, and seek, too, for fogs and darkness in"
9654,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the choicest atmospheres of the world; or else we must remove the
9655,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Ocean-mouth to a distance about four times as far from the island
9656,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of Circe, as that island is from Greece, whereas the poem evidently"
9657,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"presumes their comparative proximity. But in truth, it is useless to go"
9658,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"on accumulating single objections, for it is not upon these that the"
9659,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,confutation principally depends. The confutation of these pardonable
9660,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,but idle traditions rests on broader grounds. The grounds are such as
9661,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"really these, that in no one particular do these Italian fables--for"
9662,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"such I must call them, notwithstanding the partial countenance they"
9663,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,receive from the chaotic and seemingly adulterated parts of the
9664,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Theogony of Hesiod[545]--satisfy the letter of the text of Homer; that
9665,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"in the attempt to give it a geographical character, they misconceive"
9666,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,its spirit; and that they oblige us to override and nullify not only
9667,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the facts of actual geography, for that we might do without violating"
9668,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"any law of reason and likelihood under the conditions of the case, but"
9669,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,also the positive indications which Homer has given us from phenomena
9670,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"that lay within his knowledge and experience. In fact, they would"
9671,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"oblige us to condemn Homer as geographically unworthy of trust, within"
9672,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the sphere of the every day life and resort of the Greeks, as well as"
9673,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"in regions, which he and his countrymen never visited."

9676,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9677,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"And the result of all the violence thus done to Homer would be, that we"
9678,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"should have sacrificed at once his language and his imagination, in the"
9679,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,attempt to struggle with contradictions to the actual geography which
9680,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,defy every attempt at reconciliation.
9681,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9682,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"At the outset, according to my view, both admissions must be made, and"
9683,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"principles must be laid down, as cardinal and essential to the conduct"
9684,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,of the inquiry we have now in hand.

9686,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,~_Dislocation of actual nature._~
9687,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9688,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"It must, I think, be admitted,"
9689,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9690,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,1. That Homer has dislocated or transplanted the traditions he
9691,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"had received. For example, he has either carried the Bosphorus"
9692,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"westwards[546], or else the Straits of Messina eastwards."

9695,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9696,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,2. That therefore as we are on this occasion inquiring not into the
9697,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"geographical information Homer can give us, but into the errors he"
9698,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"had embraced, we must not be surprised if we fail to arrive at any"
9699,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"conclusions, either wholly self-consistent or demonstratively clear. We"
9700,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"must exact from his text, with something less than geographical rigour,"
9701,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,even the conditions of inward harmony.
9702,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9703,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"It may then reasonably be asked, if this be so, how are we to find any"
9704,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,clue to his meaning.
9705,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9706,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"My answer is, by laying down rules which will enable us to"
9707,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,discriminate between his primary and his secondary statements; between
9708,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the results of his knowledge, and the fruits of his fancy."
9709,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9710,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"By his knowledge I mean, what he had seen, what he had travelled over,"
9711,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"what was familiarly and habitually known to his countrymen, so as to"
9712,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"give him ample opportunities of refreshing recollection, of enlarging"
9713,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"knowledge, and of correcting error."
9714,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9715,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"By the fruits of his fancy I mean, the forms he has thought fit to"
9716,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,give to statements of geography lying outside the world of his own
9717,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"experience, and that of the Greeks in general. These statements,"
9718,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"gathered here and there as time and opportunity might serve, he could"
9719,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,hardly have moulded into a correct and consistent scheme. Emancipating
9720,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,himself wholly from obligations which it was impossible for him to
9721,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"fulfil, he has treated them simply as the creatures of his poetic"
9722,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"purpose, and has analysed, shifted, and recombined them into a world of"
9723,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"his own, in the creation and adjustment of which, the principal factor"
9724,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,has of necessity been his own will.
9725,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9726,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,~_Postulates for the inquiry._~
9727,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9728,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,I therefore lay down the following postulates:
9729,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9730,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"1. That, Homer having an Inner or known and an Outer or imagined world,"
9731,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"between which a line may be drawn with tolerable certainty, the voyage"
9732,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of Ulysses, from the Lotophagi to Scheria inclusive, lies in the Outer"
9733,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,world.
9734,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9735,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,2. That we may not only implicitly accept the geographical statements
9736,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of Homer, when they lie within his own horizon or the Inner world, but"
9737,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,may fearlessly argue from them.
9738,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9739,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"3. That arguments so drawn are available and paramount, as far as"
9740,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"they go, for governing the construction of passages relating to the"
9741,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,geography of the Outer world.
9742,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9743,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"4. That we have no title to argue, when we find a point in the Outer"
9744,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,world described in such a manner as to correspond with some spot now
9745,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"known, that Homer gave to that tract or region in his own mind, the"
9746,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"site which we may now know it to occupy, but that he is quite as likely"
9747,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,to have placed it elsewhere.
9748,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9749,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,5. That arguments grounded on the physical knowledge of the Poet are
9750,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to be trusted. I would name by way of example, (subject only to a"
9751,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"certain latitude for inexactness,) such arguments as are drawn from the"
9752,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"directions of winds, and from other patent and cardinal facts of common"
9753,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"experience, for example, the distances which may be traversed within"
9754,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,given times.
9755,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9756,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"6. So likewise are the indications, which harmonize with known or"
9757,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"reasonably presumed historical and ethnological views, to be trusted as"
9758,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,good evidence on questions relating to his geographical meaning.
9759,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9760,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"In order, however, to be in a condition to make use of indications"
9761,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"supplied by the Winds, we must consider what the Winds of Homer are."
9762,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9763,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,~_The Winds of Homer._~
9764,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9765,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"The Winds of Homer are only four in number, and the manner of their"
9766,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"physical arrangement is rude. It by no means corresponds with our own,"
9767,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"but varies from it greatly, just as his points of the compass varied"
9768,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"from ours. And though he names only four winds, yet I apprehend we must"
9769,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"consider that upon the whole he uses them with such latitude, as to"
9770,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,express under the name of some one of them every gale that blew.
9771,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9772,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"As to some of these winds, Homer has provided us with an abundance of"
9773,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,trustworthy _data_ for their point of origin: and through them the
9774,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,evidence as to the rest may be enlarged.
9775,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9776,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Homer’s governing points, from which to measure arcs of the horizon"
9777,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"were, as is evident, the sunrise and the sunset. This is clearly shown"
9778,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"by his expressions, such as πρὸς ἠῶ τ’ ἠέλιόν τε, for the east, and"
9779,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"then in opposition to this, ποτὶ ζόφον ἠερόεντα[547] for the west."
9780,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Again, when Ulysses urges upon his companions that he has lost all"
9781,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"means of forming a judgment of their position, his mode of expression"
9782,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"is this, that he does not know where is dusk or where is dawn; where"
9783,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the joy-giving sun rises, or where he sinks[548]. We must therefore"
9784,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,dismiss from our minds the four cardinal points to which we are
9785,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,accustomed. They were not cardinal points for Homer. We must also
9786,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"remember not only (1) that Homer had only two[549], but also (2) that"
9787,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"his two did not correspond with any of our four, and (3) that from the"
9788,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,variation of sunrise and sunset with the seasons of the year a certain
9789,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,amount of vagueness was of necessity introduced into his conceptions of
9790,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the point of origin for each of the different winds.
9791,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9792,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"[547] Il. xii. 239, 40."
9793,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,

9795,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9796,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"[549] Wood (Genius of Homer, p. 23,) says, ‘only four,’ meaning only"
9797,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,four winds. But it is pretty clear that Homer’s four winds were not at
9798,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,anything like ninety degrees from one another. There is in Homer no
9799,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"word meaning strictly either south, or north. _Daksha_, however, from"
9800,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"whence is derived δεξιὸς, means _southerly_ as well as _on the right_:"
9801,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"but probably S. E. rather than S. Pott, Etymolog. Forschungen, II. 186,"
9802,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,7.
9803,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9804,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"We should not, however, exaggerate this vagueness. It had its cause in"
9805,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the variations of the ecliptic, and, like its cause, it was limited."
9806,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"I suppose, however, that the eye guesses rudely at the deviations of"
9807,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the ecliptic, and that we must take N.W. and S.E. for the two cardinal"
9808,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,points of Homer.
9809,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9810,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Homer’s west then ranged to the north of west, and Homer’s east to"
9811,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the south of east. But although this must be borne in mind when we
9812,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"translate his winds into our language, yet of course the winds"
9813,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"themselves were arranged, not technically so as each to cover a certain"
9814,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"arc on the horizon, but with reference to the directions in which they"
9815,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,were found by experience commonly to blow. And in associating each wind
9816,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"with a particular point of the horizon, we must bear in mind that such"
9817,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"a point is to be regarded as its centre, and that the same name would"
9818,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,be given to a wind within a number of points on either side of it.
9819,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9820,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"As to the respective prevalence of the different winds, the criterion"
9821,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"is certainly a rude one, still it is a criterion, which is provided"
9822,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,for us by the comparative frequency of the occasions on which they are
9823,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"mentioned. Eurus is mentioned in the poems seven times, Notus fifteen;"
9824,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Boreas twenty-seven, subject to a small deduction for cases where he is"
9825,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,simply a person; and Zephyr twenty-six. The latter pair are the leading
9826,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Winds of the poem: not necessarily that they indicated the prevailing
9827,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"currents of air, but that they represented such currents of air as"
9828,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,usually prevailed with force sufficient to make them good poetical
9829,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,agents.
9830,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9831,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"We may also learn, from the epithets given to the winds, the"
9832,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,impressions which they respectively made upon the mind of Homer.
9833,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9834,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Eurus never has a character attached to it. Notus seldom has any
9835,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"epithet; but still it is mentioned, by the comrade of Ulysses in Od."
9836,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"xii. 289, as one of the most formidable winds. This may probably"
9837,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,have been on account of its direction relatively to the place of the
9838,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"speaker; because from that point it blew right upon Scylla[550]. Again,"
9839,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"as Zephyr and Notus are nowhere else associated by the Poet, the"
9840,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,presumption arises on that ground also that here Notus is put in for a
9841,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"special and local reason. It is called ἀργέστης, and is so essentially"
9842,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"allied with the idea of moisture, that νότιος stands simply for wet"
9843,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"(νότιος ἱδρὼς, Il. xi. 810)."

9848,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,αἰθρηγένης. The first of these indicates that he blew hard: and we know
9849,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the same thing from the facts, that Achilles desired him to contribute"
9850,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"towards rapidly consuming the pyre of Patroclus, and that he is often"

9855,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"But, of all the winds, the Zephyr evidently was the most prominent in"
9856,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the view of Homer. It is μέγας (Od. xiv. 458), λαβρὸς ἐπαιγίζων (Il."
9857,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"ii. 148), κελαδεινὸς (Il. xxiii. 208), δυσαὴς (Il. xxiii. 200, and Od."

9859,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"ζεφύροιο ἰώη (Il. iv. 276). In Od. xii. 289, it is mentioned with"
9860,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Notus: they are the winds most apt to destroy ships even despite or
9861,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"without the gods. For Notus, as I have said, this character seems to"
9862,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"be local: but the Zephyr is here called δυσαὴς, and the sense of the"
9863,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"passage is in accordance with his general reputation. He, with Boreas,"
9864,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,is invoked for the pyre of Patroclus: and these two are the only winds
9865,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,which are ever employed singly to make foul weather. Homer’s other
9866,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,modes of creating a tempest by the agency of the winds are (1) to make
9867,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"a combination of all or several of them, (2) to cover the matter in a"
9868,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,generality by speaking of the ὀλοοὶ ἄνεμοι without distinction.
9869,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9870,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"There is, however, in Homer a faint trace of the milder character,"
9871,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"which was afterwards more fully recognised in Zephyr, when he had moved"
9872,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"down from the north, and become a simple west wind. In the description"
9873,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of the Elysian plain, we find that it is never vexed with tempest or"
9874,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"with rain, but that the happy spirits dwelling there are incessantly"
9875,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,refreshed with the Zephyrs which spring from Ocean[552]. But even here
9876,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the breezes are λιγυπνείοντες: and this word means what is called
9877,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,blowing _fresh_. And the conception of the wind here is rather as a
9878,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"sea-wind, and therefore not a cold one, than as being soft and gentle."

9898,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"distinctions between the winds. He has two successive similes, both"
9899,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,describing the agitation of the same Assembly[555]. In the first it is
9900,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"compared to the Icarian Sea lashed by Eurus, and by Notus charging from"

9912,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"but that each two of them were capable of association, while neither"

9914,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"which I will presently notice, as cooperating with one of the other."
9915,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Of course I do not refer to those cases, where the Poet raises all the"

9917,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"will add, for those times, in anticipation of the modern discovery that"
9918,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"hurricanes are eddies, and that it is their circular motion which makes"
9919,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,them seem to blow almost simultaneously in all directions[557].

9939,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the latter[559] his companion, that though he may mean any wind"
9940,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"from west up to north, we must consider him as usually leaning from"

9945,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9946,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,The position of Boreas is the best defined of all the winds of Homer.
9947,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,He cannot come from any point to the west of due north: for all that
9948,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,space is appropriated to Zephyr. He is equally well defined on the
9949,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"other side. For he blows from Thrace, both generally, as in Il. ix."
9950,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"5, and particularly on the Plain of Troy[560]. I hold to be of no"
9951,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"authority, as fixing the direction of this wind, the Boreas which"
9952,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,carries the pseudo-Ulysses from Crete to Egypt[561]: for there Homer
9953,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"is already beyond the Inner World, and he only knows the position of"
9954,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Egypt from Phœnician report. But we have other trustworthy indications
9955,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"from within the sphere of Greek nautical knowledge, in his carrying"
9956,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Hercules from Ilium to Cos[562], in his preventing a voyage from Crete"
9957,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to Ilium[563], and in the fate of Ulysses, who, in rounding Malea,"
9958,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,is carried off by Boreas to the westward of Cythera[564]. All these
9959,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,operations can be performed only by a wind blowing from the quarter
9960,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,between east and north-east.

9972,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Putting together these indications, I think we must conclude that the"
9973,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Boreas of Homer is a wind to the east of north. But it seems plain that
9974,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"he does not embrace nearly the whole quadrant from north to east. For,"
9975,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"like and even more than Zephyr on the other side of the pole, he has a"
9976,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"leaning towards the polar side, and, in the absence of more particular"
9977,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"marks, Homer should be taken to mean by him a N.N.E. wind, that is, a"

9980,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"I take the line Il. ix. 5, which many have treated as a difficulty, for"
9981,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,a sound and valuable geographical indication. Boreas and Zephyr blow
9982,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"from Thrace. To a Greek, say at Mycenæ, Thrace, which reaches from the"
9983,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Adriatic to the Euxine, covers more than ninety degrees of the horizon."
9984,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"It is from within those ninety degrees that every Boreas, and probably"
9985,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"every Zephyr, of Homer can be shown to blow. These are facts which"
9986,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"we may hold in deposit, ready for service in the explanation of the"
9987,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,movements of the Outer Geography.
9988,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
9989,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,And along with them we must keep in mind the Homeric affinity and
9990,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"sympathy established between Boreas and Zephyr. It is so considerable,"
9991,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"and they are especially in such local proximity, that practically"
9992,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,we should not go far wrong were we to say Homer divides the whole
9993,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,circumference of his horizon into three nearly equal arcs of 120
9994,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"degrees, more or less. The first of these, beginning from due west,"
9995,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"is given to Zephyr and to Boreas. The next, reaching to within 30° of"
9996,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the South Pole, to Eurus: and the third, embracing the residue of the"
9997,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"circle, to Notus."

10001,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Notus is the great southern wind, Eurus being comparatively of little"
10002,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"account. Now, one of the chief _data_ applicable to determining the"
10003,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,direction of these winds is the passage Il. ii. 144-6. Here they are
10004,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"described as disturbing the Icarian Sea, which was within the sphere of"
10005,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Greek navigation. Now the position of that sea, on the coast of Asia"
10006,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Minor to the south of Samos, shows,"
10007,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10008,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,1. That both these winds in Homer have a decidedly southern character.
10009,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10010,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"2. That one, of course Eurus, must come from the east, and the other,"
10011,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Notus, in that place, from the west of south. Because the conflict of"
10012,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the two winds presumes a considerable space between the points from
10013,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"which they blow, while the position of the Icarian Sea requires both"
10014,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to be southern. But in the Fifth Odyssey, too, Notus is treated as the"
10015,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,proper antagonist of Boreas. His centre therefore lies a little to the
10016,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"westward of due south; but Eurus does not approach the South Pole,"
10017,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,and every wind from about S.S.E. to W. will probably fall within the
10018,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Homeric description of Notus.
10019,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10020,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,The associations of Notus and Eurus are frequent[565]. On one
10021,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"occasion, however, Notus is combined with Zephyr, though there is no"
10022,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,corresponding case of junction between Eurus and Boreas. Notus and
10023,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Zephyr are sent from the sea by Juno to blast the Trojan army with
10024,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,heat. Boreas would of course be a cold wind: and Eurus would be cold on
10025,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the plain of Troy, from passing over the chain of Ida: though in Greece"
10026,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"he melts the snow that Zephyr has brought. Differences of season, as"
10027,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"well as of situation, may have to do with these varieties of operation."

10031,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Though less strong than Zephyr and Boreas, Notus is a stronger wind"
10032,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"than Eurus. And though generally the counterpart of Boreas, his power"
10033,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,of cooperating with Zephyr shows that he must reach over the quadrant
10034,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"from the South pole to West, whereas we have no Boreas coming down from"
10035,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the North pole as far as East.
10036,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10037,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"As the opposite of Zephyr, Eurus blows principally from the"
10038,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"south-eastern quarter; and hence is in frequent cooperation with Notus,"
10039,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"but never with any other wind. He must, however, be understood to cover"
10040,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the whole space from the rigidly northern Boreas down to Notus, or"
10041,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,from about N.E. to within 30° of the South pole. Boreas is inflexibly
10042,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,confined by all the evidence of the poems to a very narrow space: and
10043,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Eurus, his neighbour eastward, does not much frequent those points of"

10048,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,The accompanying sketch expresses what I believe to be in the main
10049,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Homer’s arrangement of the Winds. At the same time, I do not know that"
10050,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,we have any practical example of any wind in Homer which blows from
10051,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"within forty-five degrees on either side of due East, or from within"
10052,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,about the same number of degrees on either side of due West. Perhaps it
10053,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"was from their local infrequency, that he does not appear to have put"
10054,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,such winds in requisition[566].
10055,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10056,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,[566] Friedreich has discussed the winds of Homer (Realien der Il. und
10057,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Od. §. 3). His results are to me unsatisfactory: but the fault seems
10058,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,to lie in his basis. For (1) he fixes the four Winds of Homer as the
10059,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,four cardinal points: and (2) he finds _data_ for ascertaining the
10060,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Winds in the Passages of the Outer Geography, instead of determining"
10061,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"those Passages themselves by the Winds, after these latter have been"
10062,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,ascertained from evidence belonging to the sphere of Homer’s own
10063,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,experience.
10064,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10065,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,The name Eurus is further attached to the point of sunrise by the root
10066,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"ἔως, to which it is traced[567]. The tracts of Aides are with Homer"
10067,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,σμερδάλεα εὐρώεντα (Il. xx. 65). May not this εὐρωεὶς come from the
10068,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,same source? The Cimmerian darkness of Homer is close to the mouth
10069,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of Ocean, and _near_ that chamber of the Sun, which is at Ææa[568]."
10070,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Viewing dawn as the middle point between night and day, Homer possibly"
10071,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"connected it with each. It seems further possible, that he connected"
10072,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the Eastern with the Western darkness: both because this would bring
10073,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"his two regions of the future world into relations with each other, and"
10074,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,because he makes the Sun disport himself with his oxen on the same spot
10075,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"in Thrinacie after his setting in the evening, and before his rising in"
10076,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the morning: a passage, which for its full explanation might require"
10077,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the supposition, that Homer believed the earth to be cylindrical in"
10078,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"form, and thus the extremes of East and West to meet[569]. There will"
10079,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"shortly be occasion to revert to this subject, in further considering"
10080,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,what were the constituent parts of Homer’s East.

10090,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"I shall trust mainly then to winds, thus ascertained from Homer’s Inner"
10091,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"world, as the means of indicating the directions of the movements"
10092,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"described in his Outer one. But besides directions, we have distances"
10093,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to consider. And here too we have some evidence, supplied by his"
10094,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"experimental knowledge, to guide us."
10095,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10096,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,By combining the inner-world _data_ of distance with those of
10097,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"direction, we shall obtain the essential conditions of decision for the"
10098,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"outer-world problems. Conditions both essential and sufficient, when we"
10099,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,can lay hold upon them; but we shall still have to contend with this
10100,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"difficulty, that in one or two remarkable cases the Poet takes refuge"
10101,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"in language wholly vague, and leaves us no guide for our conjectures,"
10102,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,except the rule of making the unascertained conform in spirit to what
10103,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,has been made reasonably certain.
10104,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10105,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,The distances of which I now speak are sea-distances. It is a somewhat
10106,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"remarkable fact, that Homer scarcely gives us land-distances at all."
10107,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Telemachus and Pisistratus drive in two days from Pylus to Sparta: but
10108,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"it is not the wont of the Poet to describe places, which communicate"
10109,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"over land, by the number of days occupied in travelling between them."
10110,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"This circumstance is illustrative of a trait, which assumes great"
10111,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"importance in Homer’s Outer Geography, namely, the miniature scale of"
10112,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"his conceptions as to all land-spaces; a trait, I may add, to which we"
10113,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,shall have occasion to revert.
10114,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10115,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,The sea-distances of Homer are performed in no less than six different
10116,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,modes.
10117,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10118,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,1. By ordinary sailing.
10119,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,2. By ordinary rowing.
10120,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"3. By rafts, Od. v. 251."
10121,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"4. By drifting on a timber, Od. xiv. 310-15."
10122,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"5. By floating and swimming, Od. v. 374, 5, 388, 399."
10123,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10124,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Sixthly, and lastly, the ships of the Phæacians perform their voyages"
10125,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"by an inward instinct, and with a rapidity described as marvellous."
10126,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10127,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,~_Evidence as to rates of motion._~
10128,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10129,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,The language of the poems nowhere takes cognizance of any difference in
10130,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"speed as between sailing and rowing. For example, when Achilles speaks"
10131,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of the time of his voyage to Phthia as dependent upon εὐπλοίη, which"
10132,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the favour of Neptune could give, he evidently means a good sea and"
10133,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the absence of tempest, and does not at all bargain for a wind from"
10134,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"a particular quarter, which was not a matter lying within Neptune’s"
10135,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"especial province. Nor does there seem to be, on general grounds, any"
10136,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,cause for assuming a difference between the average speeds of rowing
10137,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"and of sailing, when we consider, in favour of the first, that the"
10138,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"crew rowed almost to a man, with little cargo to carry; and, to the"
10139,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"prejudice of the second, that the science and art of building quick"
10140,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,sailers could not then have been understood. I therefore take rowing
10141,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,and sailing as equal in celerity. So that we have in reality no more
10142,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,than five different cases to consider.
10143,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10144,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"But, again, I think there is no reason why we should assume a"
10145,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"difference in speed between drifting on a piece of timber, and making"
10146,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,way by floating and swimming only. In practicability there may be a
10147,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,considerable difference: but that is not the point before us.
10148,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10149,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,The four methods now remaining seem to require the assumption of
10150,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,different speeds respectively.
10151,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10152,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Now Homer has supplied us with the times necessary for performing known
10153,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"distances in two cases; and has also given us a third case, which may"
10154,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,be used for checking one of the other instances.
10155,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10156,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,A case of known distance is that from the mouth of the Straits
10157,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of Gallipoli to Phthia. This, according to Achilles in the Ninth"
10158,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Iliad[570], would, with favourable weather, be performed so as to"
10159,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,arrive on the third day. It may amount to a little more than three
10160,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"degrees, and may be taken at two hundred and twenty miles. The time is"
10161,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"three days and two nights. So that, for ordinary sailing or rowing, a"
10162,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"day and a night may be taken at about ninety miles, of course without"
10163,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,any pretension to minute accuracy.
10164,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10165,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,[570] Il. ix. 362.
10166,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10167,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Secondly. With a good passage, a ship sailing from Crete to Egypt"
10168,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,arrives on the fifth day (Od. xiv. 257). But we cannot consider Homer’s
10169,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,opinion of the distance between Crete and Egypt as entitled to the
10170,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"full weight of his experimental knowledge. Again, it is to be borne in"
10171,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"mind, that here the north wind, which carries the ship, was a prime one"
10172,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"(ἀκραὴς καλὸς, 253). Lastly, much might depend on the part of Crete,"
10173,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,from which we suppose the vessel to have sailed.
10174,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10175,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"As respects the last-named question, we must, from the habits of"
10176,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"ancient navigation, suppose the eastern extremity of the island to have"
10177,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,been the point of departure; because no sailor would have committed
10178,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"himself to Boreas on the open sea, as long as he could make way under"
10179,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,cover of a shore lying to windward.
10180,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10181,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,The distance between the eastern point of Crete and the western mouth
10182,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,of the Nile is about three hundred and fifty miles; the time five days
10183,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,and four nights. This would give a somewhat less rate of progress _per
10184,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,diem_ than the last case; but then it is likely that Homer took the
10185,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,distance to be greater in that almost unknown sea (see Od. iii. 320.)
10186,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,than it really is; so that we have cause to view the two computations
10187,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"as in substance accordant. And even if they had clashed, the former"
10188,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,would still be entitled to our acceptance.
10189,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10190,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"What, however, does appear to be the case is, that Homer mistook the"
10191,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,course from Crete to Egypt. It is really S. W.: he has defined it by
10192,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the wind Boreas, which never blows from a point westward, or at the"
10193,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"very uttermost never from one materially westward, of N. So that the"
10194,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"course must have been about S. Now, as Homer knew the position of"
10195,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Crete, this would show that he brought Egypt too much to the westward,"
10196,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,by shortening the eastern recess or arm of the Mediterranean; an error
10197,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"in exact conformity, I conceive, with all his operations in imagining"
10198,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the geography of the east. But this by the way.
10199,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10200,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,The third test of sea-distances is supplied by the pretended passage
10201,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of Ulysses, on a mast, from a point just out of sight of Crete[571] to"
10202,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Thesprotia[572]. He arrives on the tenth night. The distance exceeds,"
10203,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"by about one half, the voyage from Troas to Phthia. The time is nearly"
10204,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,four times as long. But then some allowance may be made for delay on
10205,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the score of the irregular winds (ὀλοοὶ ἄνεμοι) which prevailed. We may
10206,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,therefore justly calculate the rate of a floating or drift-passage at
10207,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"about one half that of a sailing passage, or two miles an hour instead"
10208,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,of four. And here our direct evidence closes.

10213,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10214,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"At an intermediate point between these, we may place the mode of"
10215,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"passage by raft, which brought Ulysses from Ogygia. For merchant ships"
10216,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,were built broad in the beam; and the raft was as broad as a merchant
10217,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"ship[573]. Thus constructed, and with its flat bottom, it must have"
10218,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"been very greatly slower than an ordinary sailing vessel, and I venture"
10219,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,to put it by conjecture as low as two and a half miles an hour.
10220,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10221,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,[573] Od. v. 249-51.
10222,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10223,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Lastly, we have to consider the rates of the Scherian ships. About"
10224,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"these the only thing that is clear is, that Homer meant to represent"
10225,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"them as far exceeding all known speed of the kind. They went, says"
10226,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Alcinous, to Eubœa, or as the verse may be rendered, to Eubœa and back,"
10227,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,in a day[574]: they are like a chariot with four horses scouring the
10228,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"plain; the hawk, swiftest of birds, could not keep up with them[575]."
10229,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"We cannot, I think, pretend to appreciate with great precision Homer’s"
10230,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"meaning in this point; but it is plain that, as he had a map of some"
10231,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"kind in his head, he must have had some meaning with respect to the"
10232,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"distance performed by the ship from Scheria, though probably a vague"
10233,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,one. I think we may venture to take it at three times the speed of the
10234,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"ordinary sailing vessel, or at about twelve miles an hour."
10235,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10236,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,[574] Od. vii. 325.
10237,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,

10239,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10240,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Thus, taking drift-speed for our unit, we have the following scale"
10241,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,approximately established:
10242,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10243,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,1. Drift = 2 miles per hour = 48 miles per day of 24 hours.
10244,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10245,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,2. Raft = 1¼ drift = 2½ miles per hour = 60 miles per day of 24 hours.
10246,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10247,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,3. Sailing or rowing ship = 2 drift = 4 miles per hour = 96 miles per
10248,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,day of 24 hours.
10249,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10250,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,4. Hawk-ship of Scheria = 3 sailing ship = 6 drift = 12 miles per hour
10251,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,= 288 miles per day of 24 hours.--
10252,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10253,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Let us next proceed to consider, whether there are any cardinal ideas"
10254,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of particular places or arrangements in the Outer Geography of Homer,"
10255,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"which govern its general structure. For such ideas may, together"
10256,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,with the _data_ that we have now drawn from the circle of his Inner
10257,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"or Experimental Geography, assist us in the examination of what"
10258,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,undoubtedly at first sight appear to be almost chaotic details.
10259,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10260,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,~_Northward sea-route to the Euxine._~
10261,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10262,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Setting out from this point, my first business is to show, that Homer"
10263,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"believed in a sea-route from the Mediterranean to the Euxine, other"
10264,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,than that of the Straits of Gallipoli and the Bosphorus. This route
10265,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"was formed in his mind, as I shall endeavour to prove, by cutting off"
10266,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the land from east to west, a little to the north of the Peninsula"
10267,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of Greece, all the way from the Adriatic to the Euxine. Thus we"
10268,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,practically substitute an expanse of sea for the mass of the European
10269,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,continent; and we must not conceive of any definite boundary to this
10270,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"θάλασσα, other than the mysterious one which may finally separate"
10271,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"it from Ocean. Or, in other words, we must give to the Black Sea"
10272,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"an indefinite extension to the west and north-west, perhaps also"
10273,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,shortening it in the direction of the East. This is the one master
10274,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"variation from nature in Homer’s ideal geography[576]; and, when his"
10275,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"belief on this subject has been sufficiently proved, almost every thing"
10276,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,else will fall into its place with comparative ease.
10277,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10278,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"[576] On this hypothesis is founded the Homeric _Erdkarte_ of Forbiger,"
10279,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Handbuch der Alt. Geogr. I. 4.
10280,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10281,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,I will endeavour to illustrate and sustain this hypothesis from
10282,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the positive evidence, either direct or inferential, of the poems:"
10283,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,and I hope to show that it stands upon grounds independent of the
10284,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"negative argument, that it is absolutely necessary in order to supply"
10285,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"a key to the Wanderings. At the same time, I hold that that negative"
10286,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"argument, if made good, would suffice: for, though we do no violence"
10287,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,to probability in imputing to the geography of the Odyssey any amount
10288,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of variance, however great, from actual nature, yet we should sorely"
10289,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"offend against reason, if we supposed that Homer had constructed a"
10290,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"route so elaborate and detailed, without laying it out before his own"
10291,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"mental vision, and presenting it to that of his hearers, after the"
10292,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,fashion of something like a map. This was alike demanded by the realism
10293,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"(so to speak) of the time, and needful for the complete comprehension"
10294,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,and easy enjoyment of the romance.
10295,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10296,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"The indications on this subject, apart from the evidence of the"
10297,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Wanderings themselves, are as follows:"
10298,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10299,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"1. When, in the Thirteenth Iliad[577], Jupiter turns away his eyes"
10300,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"from the battle by the Ships, he turns them towards the north-east: in"
10301,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the direction, that is, in which, according to the hypothesis above"
10302,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"stated, there was for Homer not, as we now know to be the case, a"
10303,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,wide expanse of land capable of containing a countless multitude of
10304,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"tribes, but, after a certain interval, a vast and unexplored sea. Now"
10305,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the Poet tells us, not that Jupiter looked over an indefinite mass of"
10306,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"continent, or the ἀπείρονα γαῖαν; but that he looked over the country"
10307,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of the Thracians, the Mysians, the Hippemolgi, the Glactophagi, and"
10308,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the Abii. Moreover, he indicates, by giving characteristic epithets to"
10309,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"each of these nations, that they lay more or less within the sphere"
10310,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of contact with Greek intercourse and experience, and therefore at no"
10311,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,great distance to the northward: for not only are the Thracians riders
10312,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of horses, but the Mysians are fighters hand to hand, the Hippemolgi"
10313,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"are formidable or venerable, and the Abii are the most righteous of"
10314,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,men. The Glactophagi are defined by their name as feeders upon milk.
10315,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"This limited and characteristic enumeration is in conformity, at the"
10316,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"very least, with the hypothesis, that Homer imagined in that direction"
10317,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"no continuous succession of land and of inhabitants, but a sea"
10318,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,circumscribing the country of Thrace to the north.

10321,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10322,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"2. A more marked indication is, I think, yielded by the passage of the"
10323,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Odyssey, in which Alcinous says to Ulysses, ‘We will convey you to your"
10324,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"home, even though it should be more distant than Eubœa, the furthest"
10325,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"point that has been visited by our people; of whom some saw it, when"
10326,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"they carried Rhadamanthus thither, in the matter of Tityus, son of the"
10327,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Earth[578].’

10330,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10331,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"It appears to me evident, that Homer means in this place to suppose a"
10332,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"maritime route between Scheria and Eubœa, to the North of Thrace. He is"
10333,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"not, we must remember, experimentally informed as to the position of"
10334,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Scheria itself, and probably he conceived it to lie quite outside the"
10335,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"sphere of Greece, at a considerable distance to the northward. Though"
10336,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"he brings Ulysses from thence to Ithaca in a day, this is effected"
10337,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"by the privileged and miraculous rapidity of passage, which was the"
10338,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"distinguishing gift of the Phæacians, as the kin of the Immortals."
10339,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"They are indeed in contact, according to the poem, with the habitable"
10340,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"world, but they are strictly upon the outer line of it. They are of"
10341,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the race of Neptune: related to the Cyclops and the Giants: their
10342,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"ordinary life and their maritime routes could not, without doing"
10343,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"utter violence to the conceptions of the Poet, be brought within the"
10344,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"sphere of ordinary Greek experience. We cannot, therefore, be intended"
10345,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,to suppose them to have carried the ancient Rhadamanthus past every
10346,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"known town, port, and point in Greece; past Ithaca, Dulichium, the"
10347,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Cephallenes, Pylus, and the rest. Nor would Eubœa, thus approached,"
10348,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"be to Ulysses, who had himself visited Aulis on his way to Troy, a"
10349,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,good type of remoteness: nor does it answer that description for the
10350,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Phæacians themselves, if we consider it according to geographic prose;"
10351,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"for though the way to it is long, it is not so distant in a direct line"
10352,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"as other parts of Greece, Crete for example; and any people who had"
10353,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"made a voyage to Eubœa by sea, round the peninsula, would know very"
10354,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"well that the proper way to it was by land. We must, in short, presume"
10355,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"such a position for the Scheria of Homer, as to imply a communication"
10356,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"by sea between it and Eubœa, other than that through the known waters"
10357,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,of Greece.
10358,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10359,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,But if we suppose a maritime passage from the Adriatic round Thrace
10360,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to exist, then we keep the Phæacians entirely in their own element,"
10361,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"as borderers between the world of Greek experience, and the world of"
10362,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"fable. They still, when they carry Rhadamanthus, as in all other cases,"
10363,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"hang upon the skirt, as it were, of actual humanity. And, thus viewed,"
10364,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Eubœa might fairly stand for a type of extreme remoteness.
10365,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10366,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"3. Another passage of Homer, when understood according to its"
10367,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"geographical bearings, appears to me, of itself, nearly conclusive upon"
10368,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,this question.
10369,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10370,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,When Mercury is ordered to carry the message of the gods from Olympus
10371,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to Calypso[579], his proceedings are carefully described. He equipped"
10372,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"himself with his foot-wings (Od. v. 44), took in hand his wand (47),"
10373,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"and got upon the wing (49). The next step in the narrative is,"
10374,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10375,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,[579] Od. v. 43-58.
10376,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10377,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Πιερίην δ’ ἐπιβὰς, ἐξ αἰθέρος ἔμπεσε πόντῳ· (50.)"
10378,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10379,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"He then bounded along the wave (51), reached the remote island (55),"
10380,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"landed on the beach (56), and finally arrived at the cave (57). I think"
10381,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"no one can read this description, which extends over sixteen verses,"
10382,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"without feeling that it is meant to convey to us, that Mercury moved"
10383,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"with great rapidity in a right line, the shortest by which he could"
10384,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"reach his destination. But now, if this be so, then, as Pieria lies to"
10385,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the northward of Olympus, we have only to ask how does he pursue his"
10386,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"further route? From Pieria he sweeps down upon the sea, and rides upon"
10387,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the waves (54) all the way to Ogygia. It is hopeless to fit this even
10388,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"by a moderate deviation either way to any existing sea: we have only,"
10389,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"therefore, to conclude, in conformity with the other indications, that"
10390,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Homer believed in a θάλασσα to the northward of Pieria. We cannot take
10391,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"refuge in the plea, that Homer did not know where Pieria lay. First,"
10392,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"because it was on the Olympian border of Thessaly, and as Homer knew"
10393,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"that region well, he must have known that Pieria lay to the north of"
10394,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"it. Secondly, it was probably within the circle of Greek traditions;"
10395,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"since it is sometimes read for Πηρείῃ in Il. ii. 766, and at any"
10396,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,rate they seem to be in all likelihood different forms of the same
10397,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"word. Thirdly, a complete proof is given by the route of Juno in the"
10398,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Fourteenth Iliad. She passes, in accordance with the actual geography,"
10399,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"from Olympus to Pieria, from Pieria (apparently verging eastwards) to"
10400,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Emathia, and so by the Thracian mountains, evidently of Chalcidice, to"
10401,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Lemnos[580].

10405,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,4. There is another passage which may be cited in direct corroboration
10406,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,of these views[581]. The spirits of the Suitors passed (1) the stream
10407,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of Ocean, and (2) the Leucadian rock; and also passed (3) the gates of"

10413,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10414,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Now it may be observed, that to pass the Leucadian rock is not the way"
10415,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,from Ithaca to the Straits of Gibraltar: the course would lie round
10416,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,either the north or the south point of Cephallonia. Neither is it the
10417,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,way to the Bosphorus and Black Sea; which must be sought by steering
10418,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"first in a southerly direction. But it is the way to Ocean, and the"
10419,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"nether Shades, if I am correct in my belief that Homer believed the"
10420,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"route to lie along the Adriatic, and round the north of Thrace. Nor"
10421,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"am I aware of any other view of his geography, on which this passage"
10422,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"can be explained. The evidence, which it affords, is at first sight"
10423,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"conclusive in support of the proposition, that Homer’s route to the"
10424,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Ocean-mouth lay up the Adriatic. But there are two grounds, on which a"
10425,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"scruple may be felt about its reception. First, it stands in the second"
10426,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Νεκυΐα, the only considerable portion of either poem which appears,"
10427,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to me at least, open to the suspicion that it may have been seriously"
10428,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"tampered with. Secondly, the order of the passage is singular, as it"
10429,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"runs thus: they passed, or they went towards, the channels of Ocean,"
10430,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"and the Leucadian rock, and the gates of the Sun: while, according to"
10431,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Homer’s geography, the Leucadian rock would come first, the gates of"
10432,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the Sun second, and Ocean-mouth would be the last of the three points."
10433,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10434,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"But in answer to the first, the suspicions affecting this passage are"
10435,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"too vague and indeterminate to warrant our rejecting its evidence,"
10436,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,where it is in harmony with the general testimony of Homer. Even if
10437,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"these lines were interpolated, they would be remarkable as embodying an"
10438,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"ancient, probably a very ancient opinion, as to Homer’s geographical"
10439,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,view on the point at issue.
10440,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10441,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"As regards the second, we may cite the parallel case of Menelaus in"
10442,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"his narrative of his own tour. After Cyprus and Phœnicia, he describes"
10443,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"his visits in the following order: (1) Egypt, (2) Ethiopians, (3)"
10444,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Sidonians, (4) Erembi, (5) Libya. It is evident that this cannot be"
10445,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,intended to be understood as the order in which the several places were
10446,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,actually visited[582].

10449,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10450,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"We have thus, I hope, secured for Ulysses, without drawing upon the"
10451,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Wanderings for testimony, what seamen call a good or wide berth; room"
10452,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"enough for the disposition of his marvels, and the mystery of the"
10453,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,distances between them. In this northern division of the θάλασσα we
10454,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"may imagine Homer to have placed, without any impropriety, or any"
10455,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"violence done to his experience of his own latitude, both the double"
10456,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"day of the Læstrygones, and the fogs of the Cimmerians. Into it he"
10457,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"might well drive Ulysses by the force of the south wind[583], and from"
10458,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"it bring him back by the strength of Zephyr or of Boreas[584]. Lastly,"
10459,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"by means of this θάλασσα, we can avoid placing Circe and the Sunrise"
10460,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,to the west of Homer’s own country; and we are not obliged to find his
10461,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,representation of the Πλαγκταὶ involving him in the hopeless absurdity
10462,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,of contradiction to his own experimental knowledge of the general

10473,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,is to be founded.
10474,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10475,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,It is this: that the Poet has compounded into one two sets of Phœnician
10476,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"traditions respecting the Ocean-mouth, one of them originally"
10477,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"proceeding from, or belonging to, the West, and the other to the"
10478,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,North-east: and that he has chosen the north-eastern site as the ground
10479,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,on which to fix the scene of his amalgamated representation.
10480,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10481,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"The argument, which has recently been adduced for another purpose from"
10482,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the Twenty-fourth Odyssey, is available to show that the Ocean-mouth"
10483,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,of Homer is towards the north: but it does not suffice to decide the
10484,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"question between North-east and North-west, nor does it decide whether"
10485,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Homer simply transplanted the Straits of Gibraltar, or whether he mixed"
10486,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"together the accounts of it and of some other strait, and welded them"
10487,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,into one.
10488,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10489,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,This question we must examine from the evidence concerning the
10490,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Ocean-mouth supplied by the Wanderings themselves.
10491,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10492,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Ulysses and his companions, when they enter the great River Ocean,"
10493,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"enter it at a point far north, by the city and country of the"
10494,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Cimmerians, who are enveloped in cloud and vapour[585]: and they"
10495,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"are carried up or against the stream (παρὰ ῥόον), by the breath of"
10496,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Boreas[586], to the mouth of the _Inferno_. Returning from thence, they"
10497,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,come down the stream (κατὰ ῥόον Od. xi. 639) back to the sea (θάλασσα);
10498,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"and they there find themselves at the isle of Circe, where is the"

10505,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10506,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,In this account it is not difficult to trace certain outlines of
10507,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,truth. The ideas of Homer respecting the gates of Ocean would be drawn
10508,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,from reports which may have related _primâ facie_ to any one of several
10509,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"geographical points; to the Straits of Gibraltar, to the Bosphorus, to"
10510,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the Straits of Yenikalè leading into the Sea of Azof, or to all the"
10511,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,three. At one and all of these there appears to be a continual stream
10512,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,flowing inwards in the direction of the Mediterranean or θάλασσα. One
10513,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"and all, as sea-straits, present the character of a vast marine river."
10514,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"In exact accordance with these physical facts, Homer makes the ship"
10515,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of Ulysses, entering the great River Ocean, sail up the stream. We"
10516,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"may observe in passing, that he describes his θάλασσα as εὐρύπορος,"
10517,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"in evident contrast with the Ocean, which is marked, therefore, by a"
10518,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,contraction of shores.
10519,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10520,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Further, Homer had conceived the existence of what we may call"
10521,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"ultra-terrene parts, both westwards and eastwards. On the one hand,"
10522,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Menelaus, after death, is to be carried to the Elysian plain, where"
10523,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Zephyrs continually blow, springing fresh from the bed of western"
10524,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Ocean. On the other hand, the groves of Persephone are on the beach of"
10525,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Ocean, but in the furthest East."
10526,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10527,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Still it does not at all follow from this, that he had in his mind"
10528,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the idea of a double egress from the Mediterranean, or, the θάλασσα"
10529,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"at large, to the Ocean. On the contrary, we never hear of any mode of"
10530,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,access to it except one; and his placing the point where Ulysses enters
10531,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"it amidst mist and cloud, and his calling in the aid of Boreas to carry"
10532,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the ship to the groves of Persephone and mouth of the Shades (which
10533,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,he probably intended to be the exact counterpart in position of the
10534,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Elysian plain), lead to the belief that his egress from sea to Ocean"
10535,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"was in the north, and that the further route to the Shades lay, for"
10536,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the most part, in a southerly direction."

10539,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10540,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"The reader of the Odyssey will observe, that Ulysses encounters on his"
10541,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"passage tempests indeed, but yet nothing in the nature of a dangerous"
10542,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"maritime passage, before he has entered the Ocean-river, and then,"
10543,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"completing his excursion to the nether world, has returned to the"
10544,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"island of Circe[587]. Therefore we may say with certainty, that the"
10545,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"mouth of Oceanus is, according to the ideas of Homer, accessible by the"
10546,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,broad and open sea. Thus we have attained a first condition for the
10547,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,determination of its site.

10553,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"reach the island of the Sirens[588]. After passing beyond this, the"
10554,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,deity no longer lays before him a single and continuous route[589]:
10555,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"but indicates to him two alternatives, each involving a most dangerous"
10556,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"passage. The first is described in the lines Od. xii. 59-72, beginning"
10557,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"ἔνθεν μὲν γάρ. The second, which she recommends in vv. 73-110, begins"

10559,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"v. 59. Now, it must be remembered, that physically there was nothing"
10560,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to prevent his returning by the way he came, and thus avoiding both of"
10561,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,these passages. Why then does Homer expose him to such extraordinary
10562,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"danger, leaving him no option but either total destruction, or the"
10563,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"certain loss, at the least, of six men of his crew[590]?"

10574,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"by some error of his own or of his companions, or by the spite of"
10575,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Neptune, or by the vengeance which the Sun demanded and obtained[591]."
10576,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"At Ææa he has nothing to do, but to take the best way home. Tiresias"

10587,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,The answer I believe to be this. He was subject to the resentment of
10588,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Neptune, who operates by storm in the open sea. Otium divos rogat in"
10589,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"_patenti_ prensus Ægæo. As in the heroic age, every wound, generally"
10590,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"speaking, is death, so storm either invariably or commonly means"
10591,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,foundering or shipwreck. Thus then Ulysses might prudently keep to
10592,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"landlocked waters and narrow seas, even with a crisis of great danger"
10593,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"before him, rather than face the angry Sea-god on the long passages"
10594,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"over the open main, by which he had come to the land of the Cyclops,"
10595,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,and so onwards to Ææa.
10596,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10597,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Rationalized, and reduced to its simplest form, this seems to imply"
10598,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"that the routes pointed out to him by Circe, and perhaps especially"
10599,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"that which he was to prefer, were short cuts either to his home, or at"
10600,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,least back into the Inner or Greek world. And in conformity with this
10601,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"supposition, the whole prediction of Circe appears to presume that a"
10602,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,passage of moderate length would bring him back within the known world;
10603,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"for it never speaks of the breadth of any unknown sea to be crossed,"
10604,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,which to the navigators of that day was always its most formidable
10605,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,feature.
10606,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10607,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"In the mental view of Homer, then, the passage of Scylla could not lie"
10608,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,much beyond the horizon of his own Greek world and of geography proper.
10609,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,This was the more eligible of the two routes. The other was that of
10610,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the Πλαγκταὶ, or Bosphorus. It was rejected as involving certain"
10611,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"destruction: for only Jason had safely passed it by the aid of Juno,"
10612,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,and Pallas was not now at hand to succour Ulysses; since he was outside
10613,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"that Greek world, to which her action has been restricted, generally"
10614,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"speaking, and in all likelihood for poetical reasons, in the Odyssey."
10615,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Now, since both these passages are spoken of as apparently lying near"
10616,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the island of the Sirens, which is itself separated, as far as we can"
10617,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"judge, by no long interval from Ææa and Circe, the next inferences"
10618,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"we have to draw are two of very great importance. The first is, that"
10619,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,although the one strait of Homer physically corresponds with the
10620,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Straits of Messina, while by the other he plainly means the Bosphorus,"
10621,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,yet he conceived of these as within no great distance of one another.
10622,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"The second inference is that, according to the belief of Homer, the"
10623,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,waters beyond the Bosphorus were accessible by some channel other than
10624,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,that of the Dardanelles and Sea of Marmora: for otherwise Ulysses could
10625,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"not have placed himself on the farther side of those terrible narrows,"
10626,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,except by navigating one of them.
10627,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10628,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,~_Three maritime routes to Ocean-mouth._~
10629,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10630,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,There were therefore three maritime routes by which Homer conceived
10631,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"that mouth of Ocean, which Ulysses entered, to be approachable:"
10632,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10633,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,1. The route by which the hero actually arrived there:
10634,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10635,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"2. The route of Scylla and Charybdis, by which he returned from it:"
10636,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10637,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"3. The route of the Bosphorus, by which Jason had passed, and which"
10638,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Ulysses might, according to the description of Circe, have attempted."
10639,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10640,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"But now, what in the view of Homer was this mouth of Ocean? that is,"
10641,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,on what geographical basis rested the reports or descriptions which he
10642,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"adopted for the groundwork of his picture? We cannot but admire, as we"
10643,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"pass along, the manner in which the Phœnicians guarded the treasures of"
10644,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,their distant markets: no way lay to them except through a choice of
10645,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,terrors; terror in the boundless expanse of devouring waters; terror
10646,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"in shipwreck by the Πλαγκταὶ, which none but Jason (so says Circe, the"
10647,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Phœnician witness) had escaped; terror in certain loss of men by the
10648,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"voracious maw of Scylla. What, however, was this Ocean-mouth that lay"
10649,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,beyond them?
10650,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10651,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"My answer is, that there are two mouths of Ocean, either of which"
10652,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"might tolerably correspond with the Homeric picture, if tried only by"
10653,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,its relation to the intermediate points that are represented by these
10654,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,dangerous passages.
10655,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10656,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Firstly, the Straits of Gibraltar, leading to the Atlantic."
10657,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10658,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Secondly, the Straits of Kertch or Yenikalè, leading to the Sea of Azof."
10659,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10660,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,~_Straits of Gibraltar as Ocean-mouth._~
10661,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10662,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"1. As regards the Straits of Gibraltar, they correspond with the"
10663,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Homeric description in respect of their great distance from Ithaca: of
10664,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,their current ever setting inwards to the Mediterranean: of their being
10665,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"accessible, without previously leaving the wide or open sea for any"
10666,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"narrow passage: of their being, we may confidently believe, within the"
10667,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"maritime experience of the Phœnicians. Further, on the route to them"
10668,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"there lies an island triangular in form, which was already described"
10669,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"by the name Thrinacie[593]. Again, it would appear that there were"
10670,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,other islands between Thrinacie and this Ocean-mouth. For both Circe
10671,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"and the Sirens inhabit islands. Even the nearest of the Balearic isles,"
10672,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"namely, Ibiza, is from the Straits of Gibraltar about as far as Crete"
10673,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"from Egypt, which we know to have been estimated by the Poet at five"
10674,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"days’ sail. It seems, however, not unlikely that Homer, having received"
10675,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,a notice of the Balearic isles in the Phœnician reports concerning the
10676,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Pillars of Atlas, carried them over, together with Atlas himself, into"
10677,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the eastern situation, where he blends two sets of traditions into one."
10678,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,He may therefore have been supplied from this source with materials for
10679,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,his island of Circe and island of the Sirens.

10682,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10683,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Lastly, although the misty Cimmerians are close by the Ocean-mouth,"
10684,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"while the atmosphere of Gibraltar is warm and sunny, yet even the"
10685,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"fogs may find their prototype in St. George’s Channel[594], or in the"
10686,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Straits of Dover, and it may also be said that, in the hazy distance of"
10687,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"a Phœnician captain’s tale, they might from Homer’s point of view seem"
10688,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,to stand nearly together. But still this is a difficulty. There are
10689,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"other more serious impediments, which make it absolutely impossible for"
10690,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,us to say that the Homeric mouth of Ocean corresponds with the Straits
10691,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of Gibraltar. This one especially: that he has, by a multitude of ties,"
10692,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,fastened down his mouth of Ocean to an eastern rather than a western
10693,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"site; for there, at least hard by, is the dwelling of Aurora; there is"
10694,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the morning couch of the Sun; there is Circe, sister of Æetes, to whose"
10695,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,country Jason sailed through the Bosphorus; and these both have had the
10696,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Sun for their father, and Perse, daughter of Ocean, without doubt an"
10697,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"eastern and not a western personage, for their mother[595]. The site"
10698,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of Ææa will, however, together with that of Ogygia, receive presently"
10699,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,a fuller consideration.

10711,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Straits of Yenikalè, by their lying beyond the Bosphorus. The perpetual"
10712,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"current inwards[596] is another feature of correspondence, such as may"
10713,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"apply to both the cases, and such as probably assisted the process at"
10714,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"which I shall presently glance. The whole group of Oriental conditions,"
10715,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"attaching to Homer’s Ocean-mouth, appear to be exactly realized in the"

10742,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"dawn and day must ever rise; and we have occasion to notice, in various"
10743,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"forms, the association in Homer’s mind of ideas belonging to darkness"
10744,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"with the East. Again, there is a combination of a northerly with an"
10745,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"easterly direction in the conditions of the Homeric description, which"
10746,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,is exactly met by the position of these Straits relatively to Greece.
10747,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10748,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"But if we say, that these Straits form the single prototype of the"

10750,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"For there does not lie any triangular island close by the Bosphorus,"
10751,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,which might answer to Thrinacie: and there is no free maritime passage
10752,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"whatever, other than the Bosphorus, by which the Ocean-mouth, that is,"
10753,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the mouth of the _Palus Mæotis_, can be attained by a person who has"

10755,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10756,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"These facts appear to direct us plainly towards one satisfactory, and"
10757,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"as it seems inevitable, conclusion. It is exhibited in the sentences"
10758,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,that immediately follow.
10759,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10760,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"First, it seems at once clear that Homer either knew, or else dimly"
10761,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"figured to himself by Phœnician report, certain geographical facts,"
10762,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,including those which follow:--
10763,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10764,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"1. That there was an island, whose figure was defined by a word"
10765,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"signifying three promontories, and which was accessible by a passage on"
10766,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the western side of Greece.
10767,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10768,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"2. That near this island, there lay on one side the jaw of a dangerous"
10769,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,narrow.
10770,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10771,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,3. That either on the other side of it or in some other neighbouring
10772,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"quarter lay the open sea, and a route along it, by which the further"
10773,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"side of the island might be reached, without traversing the narrow."
10774,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10775,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,4. That at a point beyond both these openings (I say nothing for the
10776,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,present of the points of the compass) there lay a great stream such
10777,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"as he called Ὠκεανὸς, flowing always inwards to the θάλασσα, which he"
10778,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,supposed to be fed by it (Il. xxi. 196).
10779,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10780,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"5. That there was likewise a passage, which Homer called the Πλαγκταὶ,"
10781,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"accessible from the eastern side of Greece; and through which Jason,"
10782,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"and as he believed Jason alone, had sailed."
10783,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10784,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"6. That at a point beyond this passage too, there lay an expanse of"
10785,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"sea, θάλασσα, and again a great stream, such as he called Ὠκεανὸς,"
10786,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,flowing always inwards to the θάλασσα.
10787,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10788,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Now we have seen that he gives us in the poem one mouth, and one"
10789,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"mouth only, of Ὠκεανὸς, which corresponds with every one of these"
10790,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"propositions taken singly: it is, according to him, beyond Thrinacie,"
10791,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"beyond the Straits of Scylla and Charybdis, attainable by an open sea"
10792,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"passage, and beyond the Πλαγκταὶ or Bosphorus."
10793,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10794,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"It seems to follow almost mathematically, that he believed in an open"
10795,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"sea route, which must have lain to the north, and which established a"
10796,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"communication, independent of the Bosphorus, between the Mediterranean"
10797,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,and the Euxine.
10798,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10799,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,~_He blends two sets of reports into one._~
10800,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10801,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,It also hereby appears that he had received from the Phœnicians
10802,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"two sets of reports, one relating to western, and the other to"
10803,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"north-eastern navigation, but both involving a description of a great"
10804,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"inward flowing stream as an ultimate point, agreeably to his idea of"
10805,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the River Ocean. These two ulterior points, obtained respectively"
10806,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"from each set of reports, Homer, led by the similarity of features,"
10807,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,has blended into one. We can even now take his untrue representation
10808,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to pieces, and can see where and how it separates into two, each of"
10809,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,them geographically true. In his one mouth of Ocean he has combined
10810,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the conditions, that in nature belong to two separate geographical"
10811,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,points. Both the north-eastern report and the western report he
10812,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"has amalgamated, by carrying the remote point of the former round,"
10813,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"so to speak, in order to meet the latter: and having thus made his"
10814,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Ocean-mouth northern, as well as eastern, he consistently calls in"
10815,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Boreas to take the ship of Ulysses to the mouth of the Shades below, so"
10816,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"as to fix that point in the east, because it was the counterpart to his"
10817,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Elysian fields which lay in the west. The two sets of Phœnician reports
10818,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,are in this way oddly brought to integrate one another. The Ocean mouth
10819,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,in the Euxine gets the benefit of the open sea route; and the Ocean
10820,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,mouth at Gibraltar has credit for being placed in a northern latitude
10821,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,and eastern longitude; each report thus throwing its own separate
10822,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,attributes into the common stock.
10823,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10824,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"The effect of thus forcing Yenikalè and Gibraltar to meet, naturally"
10825,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,enough brings the Faro of Messina and the Bosphorus near to one
10826,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"another: and hence Circe, in the Twelfth Book, names them to Ulysses as"
10827,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"alternative routes, both apparently lying in the same region."
10828,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10829,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"But again I say, that in order to comprehend the Outer or imaginary"
10830,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"geography of the Odyssey, we must entirely dismiss from our minds the"
10831,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,map of Europe as it is. We must treat as having been a real map to
10832,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Homer only the little sphere which was embraced within the resort of
10833,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"ordinary Greek navigation. Beyond that narrow range, we must consider"
10834,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"him as distributing land and sea in the manner he best could, by"
10835,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the aid of reports, necessarily in that age most indistinct, and in"
10836,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"all likelihood exaggerated, and even wilfully darkened to boot, by"
10837,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,trading craft. Sometimes therefore he puts a people upon poetical
10838,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"_terra firma_ at points, where it fortunately but accidentally turns"
10839,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,out that nature has provided an antitype for the imagery of the Poem.
10840,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Sometimes he lodges them where there is none; _ubi nîl nisi pontus et
10841,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"aer_. But though details are to be thus disposed of, still the one"
10842,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,master variation from actual nature is this; the sea extended from
10843,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the Mediterranean to the Euxine, behind, i. e. to the north of, the"
10844,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Bosphorus and of Thrace. This gives us that open passage into the
10845,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Euxine, by which Homer supposed Ulysses to have reached the maritime"
10846,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"region, that Jason had sought and found through the Bosphorus."
10847,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10848,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,In sum; it is too plain to require much of the detailed proof which I
10849,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"have tried to give, that Homer believed in a great expanse of waters"
10850,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"lying somewhere to the north. The probability is, that from some"
10851,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Phœnician source he had heard rumours of the great German Ocean. It
10852,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,need not to us appear strange that his mind did not readily conceive
10853,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"an extent of land like that of the continent of Europe, when we notice"
10854,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"that his experience made him conversant partly with islands, partly"
10855,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"with countries in minute subdivisions, and of small breadth from sea"
10856,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,to sea. This great imaginary mass of waters he included within the
10857,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"θάλασσα, to which everything belonged as far as the point where the"
10858,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,great River Oceanus was reached.
10859,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10860,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"I think then that we have now found the two keys to the Outer Geography,"
10861,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10862,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,1. In the sea-route north of Thrace;
10863,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10864,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,2. In the amalgamation of the western with the north-eastern report of
10865,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the Ocean-mouth.
10866,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10867,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"From the site of the Ocean-mouth of Homer, we may most naturally"
10868,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"proceed to examine the site of Ææa; which, as being within one day’s"
10869,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"sail, is a kind of porter’s lodge to it[598], and is a point of the"
10870,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,utmost importance in the system. Hitherto I have proceeded only by
10871,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"assertion, so far as the site of the Homeric Ææa is conceived. But to"
10872,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"defend the second main proposition or key to the system, in the face of"
10873,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"counter-theories, it will be necessary to examine, with as much care as"
10874,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"may be, all the Homeric evidence that bears either upon this question,"
10875,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,or upon the kindred one of the site of Ogygia.

10878,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10879,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"We have then to inquire, subject to the rules which have been laid"
10880,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"down, first, whether Ææa, the island of Circe, is to be placed, its"
10881,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"northward direction being generally admitted, in the north-west or in"
10882,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the north-east?
10883,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10884,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Secondly, as dependent very much upon the prior question, and as"
10885,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"entering at the same time largely into the proof of it, what is the"
10886,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"site of Ogygia, the island of Calypso?"

10889,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10890,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Now I think that the arguments, which have been used for the"
10891,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"north-western theory, have been principally founded,"
10892,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10893,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"1. Upon precipitate inferences, drawn from some one or more of Homer’s"
10894,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"outer-world statements, and then illegitimately used in order to govern"
10895,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the rest of them;
10896,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10897,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"2. Upon the course of the later tradition, which was led, probably by"
10898,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the course of colonization, to identify and appropriate the particulars"
10899,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,of the Outer Geography rather in the West than in the East. For Sicily
10900,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,and Italy became at an early period familiar to the Greeks; but it was
10901,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"long before they grew to be well acquainted with the more dangerous,"
10902,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"remote, and isolated navigation of the Black Sea[599]. Perhaps,"
10903,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"indeed, the main reason for placing the tour of Ulysses all along in"
10904,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the West has been no better than this; that Homer has given us an
10905,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,account of an island apparently corresponding in form with Sicily;
10906,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"which it may very well do, and yet the conception of the site may be"
10907,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"totally erroneous. Again, with respect to traditional authority, I"
10908,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"apprehend it may be asserted, that the Fragment of Mimnermus[600],"
10909,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"which carries Jason to the East, to the chamber of the Sun, and to the"
10910,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"city of Æetes, as to one and the same point, expresses an universal"
10911,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"tradition, so far as the voyage of the Argonauts is concerned. And I"
10912,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"would also observe, that the current local appropriations about the"
10913,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,coast of Italy seem to be given up on all hands as geographically
10914,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"worthless: the only question is, not so much that of removal, as"
10915,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,into which of two quarters they shall be transplanted. On the other
10916,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"hand, the principal arguments for the north-eastern hypothesis are,"
10917,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"as I conceive, founded upon legitimate inferences, drawn from the"
10918,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"inner-world or experimental statements of Homer, and then applied, by a"
10919,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"law essentially sound, to determine the cardinal problems of his Outer"

10930,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"and Charybdis, taken to represent them, eastwards, or whether we are in"

10932,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10933,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"I answer without hesitation, that it is much more reasonable to"
10934,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,construe Homer as shifting essentially the site of Scylla and
10935,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Charybdis, than the site of the Bosphorus; and for the following"
10936,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,reasons.
10937,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10938,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,We have not the slightest reason to suppose that either Sicily or the
10939,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Scylla passage came within the experimental knowledge of Homer and the
10940,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Greeks of his time, either as to the island and the Strait themselves,"
10941,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,or as to the direction in which they lay.
10942,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10943,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"We find indeed that a continuance of winds, which ranged between E."
10944,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,and S. W. detained Ulysses in Thrinacie or Trinacria. It has from this
10945,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"been, as I think by much too hastily, inferred that Thrinacie lay to"
10946,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the north-west of Ithaca[601]. Even if it did so, we should still"
10947,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"miss the true bearing of Sicily, which is west, with all inclination"
10948,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to the south, and not north-west, from Ithaca. But the assumption is"
10949,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"in fact unwarranted. The wind, which principally held Ulysses fast in"
10950,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Thrinacie, was, as is evident from the passage, Notus, a southerly"
10951,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"wind. Eurus plays a secondary part there[602]. Besides this, the wind,"
10952,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"which Ulysses needed, may have been needed to bring him not to Ithaca,"
10953,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"but to some point on his way to Ithaca, from whence his bearings would"
10954,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"be known; to some point at which, from the Outer, it would have been"
10955,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,practicable for him to re-enter the Inner or Greek world. The needful
10956,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"conditions would be satisfied if, for instance, Thrinacie lay either"
10957,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,north-west or north-east from the Dardanelles; and then Ulysses would
10958,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,want either Zephyr or else Boreas to get there. And the opposite theory
10959,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"proceeds upon the entirely arbitrary, nay, untrue, assumption, that the"
10960,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"way back through the Narrows was, like the way by which Ulysses had"
10961,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"come to Ææa, an open-sea route, and not one in which the course would"
10962,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,have to be governed by fixed points of land lying along the course.

10971,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,of themselves to show that this island is not on the site of Sicily.

10973,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"The case is far otherwise in regard to the Bosphorus, or Πλαγκταὶ, of"

10975,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10976,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"1. That Homer was familiar with the Dardanelles, a stage on the way to"

10978,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10979,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,2. That he makes Jason pass the Bosphorus:
10980,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10981,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"3. That he also makes Jason settle at Lemnos, and become sovereign of"
10982,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the island, evidently in connection with his route from Thessaly to the"
10983,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,East.
10984,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10985,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"But Thessaly, and Lemnos too, are places of the inner world: with"

10987,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,line between that island and the home of Jason determines absolutely
10988,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,so much as this; that the general direction of his voyage was known by
10989,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Homer, at least up to this point, to have lain to the north-eastward"

10991,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
10992,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"I hold therefore that the passage of the Πλαγκταὶ is fixed immovably,"
10993,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"by known-world evidence, as to its general direction: that to"
10994,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"transplant it to the west, is to break up the foundations of Homer’s"
10995,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"experimental knowledge, which is always to be trusted: whereas to move"
10996,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,his Thrinacie eastward is merely to suppose that he gave the site which
10997,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"was poetically most convenient to a tradition which, as it came to him,"

11003,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,although the report on which this delineation was founded may probably
11004,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"have had its origin in Sicily, yet the Thrinacie of Homer is associated"

11006,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11007,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"For, though he has given us no geographical means for directly"
11008,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"determining the site, he has supplied us with other means that belong,"
11009,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"not to Phœnician rumour or fireside tale, but to his own knowledge and"
11010,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"experience. Since nothing can be more certain, than that the leading"
11011,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"local association of the Sun, for Homer as for all mankind, is with the"
11012,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,east. It is true that he is in the west just as often as in the east;
11013,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,but we certainly hold Napoleon to belong more to Corsica than to Saint
11014,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Helena; and so the mind connects the Sun with the place of his daily
11015,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"birth, and not with that of his daily death. Now, without entering upon"
11016,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"any other question for the present, I only observe, that in Thrinacie"
11017,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,are the oxen with which the Sun disports himself when not engaged in
11018,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"his daily labours; that is, as he himself supplies the explanation,"
11019,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"both before they begin, and after they are ended[603]. In deference,"
11020,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"then, to those associations, founded on actual nature, which for the"
11021,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"present purpose are strictly facts, I cannot hesitate to maintain, that"
11022,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the island of Thrinacie is upon the whole, relatively to Greece, an"
11023,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,eastern island.

11026,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11027,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,A like inference may be drawn from the names Lampetie (λάμπειν) and
11028,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Phaethusa (φάος), which he has given to the Nymphs of the Sun. Had the"
11029,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"island been in his intention western, he would have called them by"
11030,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,names of a different etymology.
11031,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11032,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"And as the Scylla passage, which is on its coast, is near the Πλαγκταὶ,"
11033,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"I think we shall pretty closely conform to the views of Homer, if"
11034,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"we make Thrinacie form the western side of the Bosphorus, and if we"
11035,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,separate it by an imaginary or poetical Scylla from the main land of
11036,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Turkey in Europe.
11037,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11038,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Again, it is admitted that Αἰήτης has his name from Αἰαίη. From the"
11039,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"personal relations of Æetes, as well as from those of his daughter"
11040,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Circe, we may therefore argue respecting the site of Ææa, provided we"

11044,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Now their parentage furnishes a point of this kind, on both the"

11047,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,daily sojourn (out of work-hours) in the east. The mother is Perse: and
11048,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"enough, I think, has been shown with respect to the import of this name"
11049,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"for the Achæan mind[605], to make it pretty certain that, when Homer"

11058,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,It is now time to bring more directly into the discussion a point much
11059,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,contested--the situation of the island of Calypso. The usual modes of
11060,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"solution, which place the original of this picture on the Bruttian"
11061,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"coast or in Malta[606], are inadmissible in spirit as well as in the"
11062,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,letter. For very great remoteness is the most essential point in the
11063,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"description, and to bring it near would wholly change its character. It"
11064,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,requires eighteen days of favourable wind[607] to come by raft within
11065,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,sight of Scheria from Ogygia: while even the distance from Crete to
11066,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Egypt, a greater one than from the Bruttian coast to Greece, might"
11067,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"be performed, as Homer thinks, in five[608]. It is the midpoint, or"
11068,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"ὄμφαλος[609], of a vast expanse of sea: and Mercury, passing thither"
11069,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"from Olympus, mentions the route as one which traverses a mighty space"
11070,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of water, without habitations of men between[610]. Again, the name"
11071,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,of Calypso (καλύπτειν) places it wholly beyond the circle of Greek
11072,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"maritime experience: as does her relation to Atlas, who holds the"
11073,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"pillars, that is, stands at the extremity, of earth and sea. The first"
11074,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"and cardinal point to be fixed therefore is its decided, if not extreme"

11092,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,on the proper homeward line of the voyage of Ulysses[611]. Consequently

11104,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"derived from the route taken by Mercury, when he carries the message"
11105,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of the Immortals to Calypso, which in another point of view we have"
11106,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,already had to examine[612]:

11114,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,move in a direct line towards his object. But Pieria is a district
11115,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"stretching along the shore of Macedonia; it begins in the south, to"
11116,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the eastward of Olympus, and then extends due north of it. Its limits"
11117,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"are variously defined[614]; but the only question about it could be,"
11118,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"whether it verges, not to the westward, but to the eastward of North."
11119,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Again, from the route of Juno in the Fourteenth Iliad[615], no question"

11128,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,A line drawn from Olympus over the centre of Pieria would carry Mercury

11130,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Pieria, diverge a little either to the east or the west of due North,"
11131,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,but only a little. Consequently the island of Calypso may be affirmed
11132,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to be, according to the intention of Homer, in the North, and not very"
11133,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,far from due North.
11134,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11135,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,This conclusion is confirmed by two other arguments; which are both
11136,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of the class which I have described as legitimate, because they are"
11137,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,founded on Homer’s physical knowledge of the direction of the winds.
11138,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11139,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,After the storm has destroyed the ship of Ulysses to the south of
11140,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Thrinacie, Notus, a wind of decidedly southerly character, carries him"
11141,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"back again to Scylla, Od. xii. 426: and again, when he has passed it,"
11142,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,he proceeds thus[616]:
11143,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11144,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,[616] Od. xii. 447.
11145,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,

11148,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11149,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Now there is no mention between these two passages either of any change
11150,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of wind, or of any particular wind. Consequently it seems rational to"
11151,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,assume that Homer meant us to understand a continuance of the wind just
11152,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"named, namely Notus. Even independently of this collocation, we should"
11153,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"be thrown back upon the general rule of the Wanderings, which is that"
11154,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"southerly winds blow Ulysses away from home, while northerly ones bring"
11155,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,him back again.
11156,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11157,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Consequently, the natural construction to put upon the passage is, that"
11158,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"it was a south wind, whether a little east or west of south matters"
11159,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"not much, which continued to blow, and which drifted Ulysses away"
11160,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,from Ithaca to the island of Calypso. This is in entire accordance
11161,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,with the passage which describes him as windbound by Eurus and Notus
11162,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,at Thrinacie; since the way from home is presumably the exact reverse
11163,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of the way towards it. But it will be said, this implies that he"
11164,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"made westing on his way to Ogygia from Ææa. I answer, that this is"
11165,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,probably so: for Circe is described as immediately connected with the
11166,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"east, while Calypso is far, as Mercury complains, from all land and"
11167,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"habitation: so that apparently her island is, in the intention of"
11168,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Homer, materially to the westward, as well as greatly to the northward,"
11169,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of Ææa. But the main direction taken from Scylla is northward; and,"
11170,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"since Scylla is near the Πλαγκταὶ, and the Πλαγκταὶ are the Bosphorus"
11171,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of actual nature, it must be taken from a point near the Bosphorus,"
11172,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,along the imaginary expanse of an enlarged and westward-reaching Euxine.
11173,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11174,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"According to this argument, then, Ogygia might lie upon a line drawn"
11175,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,from Mount Olympus in a direction not very wide either way of St.
11176,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Petersburgh.
11177,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11178,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Nor are we wholly without means of measuring the distance. He floats
11179,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"(from Scylla) for nine days, and arrives on the tenth. Now this is just"
11180,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"what happened to the pseudo-Ulysses[617], who in the same space of time"
11181,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,drifted from a point near Crete to the country of the Thesprotians. We
11182,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"may therefore fix Ogygia as (in the intention of the Poet), at about"
11183,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the same distance from Scylla, which we measure from the south of"
11184,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Epirus to a point near, yet not in sight of, Crete. But this in passing."
11185,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11186,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,[617] Od. xiv. 310-15. 301-4.
11187,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11188,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,The corresponding argument is derived from the homeward passage of
11189,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Ulysses, and stands as follows:"
11190,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11191,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,For seventeen days Ulysses pursues his raft-voyage from Ogygia to
11192,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Scheria; and the raft threatens to founder on the eighteenth. He then
11193,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"floats, by the aid of the girdle he had received from Ino. Up to this"
11194,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,point there is no positive indication of the wind; the argument from
11195,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the relation between his course and the stars I will consider shortly.
11196,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"But after he has put on the girdle, and when Neptune withdraws his"
11197,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"persecution, since he is now approaching the horizon of the Inner"
11198,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"world again, Minerva’s agency revives, and she sends a north wind or a"
11199,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"north-north-east wind, Boreas, to bring him to Scheria."
11200,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11201,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Now there is no reason for our supposing that Homer meant to represent
11202,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Ulysses as changing his general direction at this particular point. The
11203,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,orders of Circe with respect to the stars all indicate a single right
11204,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"line from Ogygia to Scheria, and neither the wind nor his course alter,"
11205,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,until he has seen the island on the far horizon. The natural inference
11206,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"therefore is, that Boreas, the N. or N. N. E. wind, which at last"
11207,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"drifted him in, was the wind which had brought him all the way from the"
11208,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"island of Calypso, over an unbroken and unincumbered expanse of sea."
11209,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11210,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"We appear to have seen, thus far, that Ogygia is greatly to the"
11211,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"northward, and probably somewhat to the westward, of the Strait of"
11212,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Scylla. We shall obtain further light upon the site of that island, if"
11213,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,we can more precisely define the position of Scylla with regard to
11214,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"what lay southward, as well as with respect to what lay northward, from"
11215,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,it.

11222,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"2. The comrades of Ulysses, when they arrive at the island, and when"
11223,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"he attempts to dissuade them from landing, reply by asking what is to"
11224,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"become of them if they set sail at night, and are then caught by a"
11225,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,squall of Eurus or of Zephyr (284-93).
11226,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11227,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,3. The ship is windbound in Thrinacie for a month by Eurus and Notus;
11228,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,which may be taken in Homer as the winds that cover the whole horizon

11249,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,~_Scylla and the Dardanelles._~
11250,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11251,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"The question therefore is, what conclusion can we draw from the"
11252,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,evidence now before us as to the position of Scylla relatively to the
11253,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Dardanelles? I think a pretty clear one.
11254,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11255,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"We have at least two of those statements, which may be called"
11256,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"experimental, now before us. Homer knew the position of the mouth of"
11257,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the Dardanelles. He knew the nature of the wind Notus. And there is a
11258,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"third piece of evidence not unimportant, which we may here properly"
11259,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"bring into view. We have seen that, in Il. ii. 845, Homer confines"
11260,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,or contains his Thracians (ἔντος ἐέργει) by the Hellespont: and the
11261,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Hellespont with him means all the waters from the Sea of Marmora to the
11262,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,northern Ægæan inclusive. Now by this he intends only a part of the
11263,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Thracians, those, say, of the plain of Adrianople. It is presumable"
11264,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,therefore that he believed the configuration of the coast at the two
11265,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,extremities of the Dardanelles to be something like at least two of the
11266,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"sides of a square, running N. and W. respectively: for unless it formed"
11267,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"a portion of some marked figure, it would not answer his description of"
11268,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"including a certain district, and the words would become applicable to"
11269,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the whole of Thrace alike. Therefore it appears that Homer thought the
11270,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"northern coast of the Sea of Marmora trended, from its western point,"
11271,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"more rapidly to the north, than is really the case."
11272,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11273,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"The most decisive evidence, however, is that which had been previously"
11274,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,named.
11275,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11276,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"When the storm came, which shattered the ship, Ulysses was on the true"
11277,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,course from Thrinacie to the Dardanelles. But if we know the point for
11278,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"which he was making in a right line from point _x_, and if we also"
11279,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"know the wind which carried him back to point _x_, then the line on"
11280,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"which point _x_ itself lies is also known. In other words, as Notus,"
11281,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"or say the S.S.W. wind, carried him back upon Scylla, Scylla lies to"
11282,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the N.N.E. of the inner mouth of the Dardanelles: and the unnamed wind
11283,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"which takes him back to Scylla is Notus, which we are entitled to"
11284,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"consider as blowing (even as Boreas, its counterpart, blows from due N."
11285,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,to the eastward) from any point between the limit of Eurus on the East
11286,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of South, and 45 or even 90 degrees beyond South to the westward."
11287,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11288,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Ææa, then, is in the East; with somewhat of an inclination, as measured"
11289,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"from Greece, towards the north. Ulysses has much westing to make, in"
11290,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,order to get to Scheria. Part of this is made on his passages between
11291,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Ææa and Ogygia in the farther north. The rest in the course of his
11292,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"long seventeen days’ voyage from the north, which is propelled, as it"
11293,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"would appear, by Boreas, and therefore includes also a slight westerly"
11294,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,inclination.
11295,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11296,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"All these arguments converge towards the same conclusions, and all of"
11297,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"them are mainly founded, not on Homer’s outer-world representations,"
11298,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"but upon indications drawn from his knowledge of nature, or else from"
11299,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,his experimental or otherwise familiar acquaintance with the Inner
11300,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"world: that is, they are built not on the figures of his fancy, but on"
11301,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the facts of his own and his countrymen’s every-day experience.
11302,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11303,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,And now let us consider the adverse construction put upon the text of
11304,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the Odyssey; particularly with regard to the island of Ææa.
11305,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11306,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,~_Why Ææa cannot lie North-westward._~
11307,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11308,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"It is quite plain, from the accounts given of the route both ways, that"
11309,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the Ocean-mouth is meant by Homer to be near the island of Ææa; that
11310,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"is, within a day’s sail[620] of that island. How is this reconcilable"
11311,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"with the doctrine, which places the island in the far north-west? In"
11312,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the north-east we have an Ocean-mouth, the situation of which the Poet,"
11313,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"guided up to a certain point by his inner-world knowledge, has not very"
11314,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,inaccurately conceived. In the north-west there is no Ocean-mouth. The
11315,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Straits of Gibraltar, though they lie rather to the south of west from"
11316,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Ithaca, must be carried far into the north for the purpose; in what"
11317,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"form, or with what accompaniments, it is hard to conceive. To attempt"
11318,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,such a transposition would involve the complete abandonment of all
11319,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"actual geography, and would after all leave us involved in hopeless"
11320,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,confusion in the effort to construct any tolerable scheme from the text

11360,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"There is, I confess, something almost of _naïveté_ in the confession"
11361,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of Nitzsch, that ‘it sounds rather strange to interpret ἀνατολαὶ"
11362,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"without any reference to sunrise, since it is the customary counterpart"
11363,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to δύσις, the sunset.’ But fortunately there is no Homeric evidence"
11364,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"against it: as indeed there cannot well be, since the word occurs in"
11365,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"no other passage. With respect to Ἠὼς, Nitzsch contends that it means"
11366,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"not dawn, but light: and he quotes the passages which say, ‘your glory"
11367,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"shall reach as far as Ἠὼς,’ and ‘horses, the best to be found beneath"
11368,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the Sun and Ἠώς.’ Certainly it is most allowable, (though I by no means"
11369,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"think the sense of dawn inadmissible in these two passages,) especially"
11370,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"as day goes nowhere except preceded by dawn, to generalize the word"
11371,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Ἠὼς so as to make it equivalent to light. But the fatal flaw in the
11372,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"interpretation is this, that when Ἠὼς is thus used, it is invariably"
11373,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,apart from any circumstances which can give a local colour to its
11374,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"meaning. But wherever there is any thing local implied, as is admitted"
11375,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to be in the case before us, the ἠὼς uniformly means the east, though"
11376,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,with a certain indefiniteness perhaps as to northward and southward
11377,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"inclination. For instance, when Homer speaks of omen-birds flying"
11378,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"eastwards, he describes them as flying πρὸς ἠώ τ’ ἠέλιόν τε, and the"
11379,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"opposite movement as ποτὶ ζόφον, which here evidently means north-west,"
11380,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,although it too may signify darkness in general. The whole aim of the
11381,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"passage (Od. xii. 1-5) is, to fix locality; and it is in the teeth of"
11382,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"all Homeric usage to deprive ἠὼς in such a passage of local force,"
11383,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,while it confessedly can have no local meaning but an eastern one.
11384,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11385,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"To me, I confess, it appears that Homer has nowhere done more,"
11386,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"and rarely so much, in a single passage, as in this, with a view"
11387,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of declaring his intention. The island Ææa, irrespective of all"
11388,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"geographical argument, is, as we have seen, directly bound and fastened"
11389,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to an eastern site by four separate cords. First, as the rising point"
11390,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of the Sun. Secondly, as the residence of Dawn. Thirdly, because"
11391,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Circe, its mistress, has the Sun, the most eastern of all mythological"
11392,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"conceptions except the Dawn, for her father. Fourthly, because she has"
11393,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"also Perse, whose name indicates a trans-Phœnician origin, for her"
11394,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"mother. And further, I am convinced we cannot alter the place of Ææa"
11395,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,without uprooting the whole Phœnician scheme of the Outer Geography.
11396,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11397,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,The scope and range thus given to the adventures of Ulysses confines
11398,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"them without doubt to the northern semi-circle, but allows them to"
11399,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"reach, within that semi-circle, to its eastern and to its western"
11400,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"extremities, as they are imagined by the Poet. Æolus and the"
11401,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Læstrygonians are evidently placed by him in the north-west. The
11402,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"hypothesis, which has here been maintained for Ææa and Calypso,"
11403,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"supplies an effectual counterpart, and properly fills up the eastern"
11404,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"corner. But, independently of all other objections, the north-western"
11405,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"hypothesis for these islands jumbles them, if I may so speak, in one"
11406,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"heap with the others, and leaves the eastern quarter towards the North"
11407,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"wholly unoccupied. And yet that East was, for a Greek, the source and"
11408,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the scene of the richest legendary and mythological representations.
11409,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Such an incongruous view of the question would not, I think, be at all"
11410,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"in keeping with Homer’s ordinary modes of conceiving, handling, and"
11411,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,presenting his materials.

11414,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11415,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"But I am aware that, up to this time, we have left out of view a"
11416,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"passage, of which I freely admit that the prevailing, and in so far"
11417,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the most obvious, interpretation is against me. Ulysses sails over"
11418,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the sea from Ogygia, governing the rudder of his raft with art, and"
11419,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"watching the stars, especially the Great Bear; which at that period, I"
11420,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"believe, was nearer the Pole, and was a more conspicuous and splendid"
11421,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"astronomical object, than it now is. It was with respect to this"
11422,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,constellation that he had received a particular order from Calypso[623]:
11423,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11424,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,[623] Od. v. 276.
11425,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11426,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"τὴν γὰρ δή μιν ἄνωγε Καλυψὼ, δῖα θεάων,"
11427,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,ποντοπορευέμεναι ἐπ’ ἀριστερὰ χειρὸς ἔχοντα.
11428,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11429,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Or, according to the common construction of the words, he was to keep"
11430,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,that constellation on the left during his voyage. But if his course lay
11431,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"in the direction of a right line drawn from St. Petersburgh to Corfu,"
11432,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"it appears that Arctus, when visible to him, would be visible on the"
11433,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"right, and not on the left."
11434,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11435,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"I could not, however, accommodate myself to this passage at such a"
11436,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"cost as that of oversetting an interpretation of the general scheme,"
11437,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"which is so deeply rooted both in the letter and spirit of the poem,"
11438,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"as is the eastern, and likewise somewhat north-eastern, hypothesis"
11439,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"for Ææa, together with a northern site for Ogygia. These two, it may"
11440,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"be observed, stand together. It is plain, from the times occupied by"
11441,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the several stages between Ææa and Ogygia, and from the language used"
11442,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"where no precise time is stated, that the Poet conceived the distance"
11443,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"between them to be limited, though very considerable. And indeed the"
11444,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,north-western hypothesis for Ææa would do nothing for the passage I
11445,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"have quoted, unless we also carry Ogygia into the north-west, in order"
11446,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"that Ulysses, on his way home from it, may have Arctus on his left."
11447,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Inasmuch, however, as the admission of the received sense for the lines"
11448,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,would involve us in a new series of the most complicated and hopeless
11449,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"contradictions, we must look for relief in some other direction."

11451,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,~_On the genuineness of the passage._~
11452,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11453,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"I desire to eschew, as a general rule, the dangerous and seductive"
11454,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,practice of questioning the genuineness of the text because it seems to
11455,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"stand in conflict with a favoured interpretation. I may however state,"
11456,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"without unduly relying on them, one or two particulars which, drawn"
11457,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"from the poem itself, may show that these two lines are not unjustly"
11458,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,open to the suspicion of interpolation.
11459,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11460,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,1. The two lines are wholly void of any necessary connection with what
11461,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"precedes and follows them, and the text is complete without them."
11462,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,We should not break up the passage generally by removing them. This
11463,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"argument, however, is one purely negative."
11464,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11465,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"2. These lines tell us, that Calypso had bid Ulysses keep Arctus on his"
11466,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,left. Now Homer has given us a speech of Calypso[624] on the subject of
11467,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"this voyage, in which she promises to send, from behind him, a breeze"
11468,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,which shall carry him home. But there is in this speech no order to
11469,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,him whatever about observing the stars; and the promise of the wind in
11470,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"some degree, though not perhaps quite conclusively, tends to show that"
11471,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"no such injunction was needed. For it is plain that, if the wind blew"
11472,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"fair across the open sea, he did not depend at all upon the helm, and"
11473,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"noticing the stars would be of no assistance to him. I rely, however,"
11474,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"more upon this, that there is here a sort of patchwork, very unlike"
11475,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Homer’s usual method, in the mode in which the injunction is recorded."
11476,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Clearly, if Calypso gave a direction respecting the stars, the proper"
11477,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,place for it was in the speech where she delivered to Ulysses what may
11478,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,be called his general instruction for the voyage. And I am not sure
11479,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"whether another instance can be found in the whole of the poems, where"
11480,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,an omission of something relevant and material in one of the speeches
11481,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,is supplied by a recital in the subsequent narrative. It is wholly
11482,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"contrary to the manner of Homer, who so uniformly throws into speech"
11483,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,and the dramatic form whatever is susceptible of being thus handled.
11484,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11485,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,[624] Od. v. 160-70.
11486,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11487,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"3. The expression ἐπ’ ἀριστερὰ χειρὸς is found nowhere else in Homer,"
11488,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,though the phrase ἐπ’ ἀριστερὰ occurs many times.
11489,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11490,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"4. There is no other passage in the Wanderings, or elsewhere in the"
11491,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"poems, which describes the conduct of navigation by means of the"
11492,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,stars. In the Iliad we have the mention of a star in connection with
11493,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"sea-travelling; but it is simply as a portent, (ναύτῃσι τέρας, Il. iv."
11494,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"76). On this, however, if it stood alone, I should place no commanding"
11495,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"stress: and it should also be observed that the objection is one which,"
11496,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"if admitted, would displace eight lines."
11497,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11498,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,So much for the genuineness of the passage.
11499,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11500,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"As respects the grammatical meaning of the phrase, I have endeavoured"
11501,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,to discuss it at large in a separate paper; and to show that its real
11502,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,sense is in fact the reverse of that which is ordinarily assumed. It
11503,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"means, I believe, a star looking _towards_ the left, and therefore a"
11504,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,star looking _from_ and situated _on_ the right hand in the sky.
11505,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11506,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"In no case, however, can I admit it to be the true meaning of Homer,"
11507,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,that Ulysses is to follow a south-westward course from Ogygia to
11508,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Scheria; because this is at variance with all the trustworthy, I must"
11509,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"add with the consentient, indications of Homer’s intention in the whole"
11510,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"arrangement of the tour, as well as in the particular description of"
11511,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Circe’s island. It is also in contradiction to those indications, drawn"
11512,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"from his inner or experimental geography, which determine at certain"
11513,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,points the bearings applicable to the Outer or Phœnician sphere.
11514,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11515,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Before proceeding to draw up in propositions the whole outline of the
11516,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"interpretation which I venture to give to the route of Ulysses, I would"
11517,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"call attention to the means, which the Poet has adopted to signify to"
11518,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,us his own doubt and incertitude respecting its actual bearings at
11519,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,several important points.
11520,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11521,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"By means of the wind Boreas he indicates to us the direction, not"
11522,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"however the distance, of the Lotophagi. After leaving them, he tells"
11523,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,us nothing either of distance or direction between their country and
11524,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,that of the Cyclopes. From this point he provides us with certain aids
11525,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"until we reach Æolia. When in Æolia, Ulysses is to the north-west of"
11526,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Ithaca: for the Zephyr given by Æolus, he says, would have carried"
11527,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"him home. From this isle, six days of rowing take him to Læstrygonia."
11528,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Another passage of indefinite length next carries him to Ææa; and,"
11529,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"arriving here, he is entirely out of his bearings; he cannot tell where"
11530,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"is east or west[625], the point of dusk or the point of dawn, until he"
11531,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,has been duly instructed by Circe: but he sees an unbounded sea (πόντος

11538,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"This expression of ignorance, put into the mouth of Ulysses, probably"
11539,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"conveys the true sense of the Poet; who, more or less puzzled"
11540,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"with even his own method of harmonizing the Phœnician reports, and"
11541,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,suspecting that it might not bear the test of application to actual
11542,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"nature, shielded himself by anticipation, through giving us to"
11543,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,understand that he did not mean to submit Circe’s isle to the strict
11544,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,rules of geographical measurement.
11545,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11546,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"And indeed it was no wonder that he felt some diffidence, when we"
11547,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,recollect that he had to concentrate in a single point facts or
11548,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"traditions that embraced east, north, and west. Eastern his site must"
11549,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"be to allow of the rising of the sun, and the accompanying legends:"
11550,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"he may have had misgivings, lest his Thrinacie, and also other"
11551,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"traditions of which he had to work up the materials, should in reality"
11552,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"lie westward from Greece: lastly, an appreciable northern element"
11553,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,was involved in the general direction of the navigation through the
11554,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Bosphorus, which in fact supplies a kind of meeting-point for the two"
11555,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"former. The remedy is, thus to hang the island of Circe in a vague and"
11556,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"shadowy distance, which gives the nearest practicable approach to an"
11557,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,exemption from the laws imposed by any determinate configuration of the

11559,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11560,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Nor are these the only cases, in which Homer has afforded us tokens"
11561,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,of his own want of clear knowledge and confidence in regard to the
11562,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"scenes through which he has carried his hero. On the contrary, he has"
11563,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"indicated the haziness of his views, and the insecurity of the ground"
11564,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"he trod, by forbearing in several other instances to fix with precision"

11570,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,We are now at liberty to approach the last portion of our subject. We
11571,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"have, I trust, fixed the distinction of the Inner and Outer Geography;"
11572,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"ascertained the keys of the outer system, and fixed its governing"
11573,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"points. It remains to inquire what, according to the data ascertained,"
11574,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,did the Poet intend to be the route of Ulysses over the face of his
11575,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"ideal map; and then, finally, to show its relation to that of Menelaus,"
11576,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,and to Homer’s general conception of the configuration and distribution
11577,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,of the surface of the earth.
11578,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11579,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"I. His first halting-place, after quitting Troy, is with the Cicones,"
11580,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,in Thrace. This visit was paid with scarcely a deviation from his
11581,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,homeward route: and therefore it does not belong to the Outer
11582,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Geography. The Cicones of the Odyssey were probably placed near the
11583,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,northernmost point of the Ægæan sea (Od. ix. 39).
11584,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11585,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"II. From the country of the Cicones, he sails southward, under a"
11586,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"heavy north-north-east gale (Od. ix. 67), which lasts for three days."
11587,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"He has then fair weather, till he gets to Cape Malea. But, as he is"
11588,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"rounding Cape Malea, the north-north-easter returns, and drives him"
11589,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"down the west coast of Cythera (now Cerigo), and so out to sea (79-81)."
11590,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"After nine days’ sail, with ὀλοοὶ ἄνεμοι, he reaches the land of the"
11591,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Lotophagi (82-4). Now, as it took five days of the best possible wind"
11592,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to sail from Crete to Egypt (Od. xiv. 253), we may perhaps assume that,"
11593,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"in the ten days of veering gales, about an equal distance was made"
11594,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,in the general direction of south-south-east indicated for us by the
11595,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Boreas of v. 82. This will place the Lotophagi on the Syrtis Major, now"
11596,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the Gulf of Sidra. Here the region of the marvel-world begins: and the
11597,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"mention of the ὀλοοὶ ἄνεμοι, in lieu of the pure Boreas, may be taken"
11598,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"as fair notice from the Poet, that he had no precise knowledge on what"
11599,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,portion of the coast of Africa Ulysses was to set his foot.
11600,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11601,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"The Lotophagi are full of Egyptian resemblances: and it appears that,"
11602,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,as Egypt and Phœnicia were for Homer the two greatest border-lands
11603,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"between the real and the imagined worlds, therefore Ulysses makes his"
11604,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"first step into the Outer world through a quasi-Egyptian people, and"

11609,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of distance or direction (103-5). But as, within the Outer sphere,"
11610,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"northern winds are always homeward, and southern ones carry Ulysses"
11611,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"outward, we may assume that Homer here intended some southern wind;"
11612,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"though, as he breaks at this juncture the last link with the known"
11613,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"world, he could not venture to state any thing like the precise point"
11614,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,of the compass.
11615,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11616,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Shall we place the Cyclopes of Homer on any point of _terra firma_, or"
11617,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,must we imagine a country for them?
11618,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11619,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Tradition has answered this question by commonly placing them in
11620,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Sicily. But a vague tradition, as we have seen, is of little authority"
11621,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"in regard to Homeric questions; and in this instance, I think, it may"
11622,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"be shown to be in error, for the following reasons:"
11623,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11624,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,1. The country of the Cyclopes is not an island: it is mainland (γαίη
11625,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Κυκλώπων, 106), with an island near to it, 105. By the expression γαίη,"
11626,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Homer sometimes means a great island such as Crete: but we have no
11627,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,authority for supposing he would apply it to Sicily.
11628,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11629,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,2. It can hardly be doubted that the little which Homer probably did
11630,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,know of Sicily is represented to us by his Thrinacie. And all this
11631,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"consists in two points: the first, that it was an island (Od. xii."
11632,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"127): the second, that it was triangular, and derived its name from"
11633,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,its form. But his Thrinacie he has given to the oxen of the Sun: and
11634,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"therefore he certainly does not mean it to be the land of the Cyclopes,"
11635,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"or he would have given it the same name on both occasions. Indeed, on"
11636,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the contrary, he has actually given another name to the land of the"
11637,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Cyclopes: it is the εὐρύχορος Ὑπέρεια of Od. vi. 4. I may add, that"
11638,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the epithet εὐρύχορος is not generally applicable to Sicily, which is"
11639,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"channelled all through with hill and dale, and which nowhere, unless"
11640,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"perhaps between Syracuse and Catania, seems to present any great"
11641,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,breadth of plain.
11642,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11643,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"3. Besides this, Ulysses traverses very long distances[626], in order"
11644,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to reach Ææa from Hypereia: but Thrinacie, on the other hand, is very"
11645,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"near Ææa, so that he has not retraced his distance, and therefore"
11646,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,cannot be in Sicily.
11647,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11648,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,[626] See Od. x. 28 and 80.
11649,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11650,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Where then were situated these Cyclopes, to whose country Ulysses came"
11651,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,after quitting the Lotophagi? It is plain that they were not within the
11652,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Greek maritime world, or Homer would, we may be sure, have indicated"
11653,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"their position by the time of the voyage, or by the quarter from which"
11654,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the wind blew to take him there.
11655,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11656,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"I submit that Homer meant to place the Cyclopes in Iapygia, the heel of"
11657,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Italy; a region nearly corresponding, on the west of the Ionian sea,"
11658,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,with the position of Scheria on the east. This hypothesis is consistent
11659,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"with the whole evidence in the case, and might well stand on that"
11660,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"ground only. But it is, I think, also sustained by a separate argument"
11661,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,from the migration of the Phæacians[627].
11662,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11663,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,[627] Od. vi. 4.
11664,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11665,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"The Phæacians, descended like the Cyclopes from Neptune, were recent"
11666,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,inhabitants of Scheria; they formerly dwelt near the Cyclopes in
11667,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Hypereia, and were dislodged from thence by the violence of their"
11668,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"brutal neighbours. They removed under Nausithous, and settled in"
11669,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Scheria.
11670,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11671,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,They were flying from a race who had no ships with which to follow
11672,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"them. If Hypereia in which they lived was Iapygia, any place in the"
11673,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"situation of Scheria, or near it, would be a natural place of refuge"
11674,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"for them. But if they had been in Sicily, Homer in all likelihood would"
11675,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"not have carried them beyond the neighbouring coast of Italy, which"
11676,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,would have afforded them the security they desired.
11677,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11678,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"IV. From Iapygia or Hypereia, the country of the Cyclopes, Ulysses"
11679,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,proceeds to pay his double visit to Æolia. We are not assisted in
11680,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the first instance (Od. ix. 565. x. 1.) by any indication of wind or
11681,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"distance. It is not unfair to presume that Stromboli, with its active"
11682,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"volcano, was the prototype of this gusty island. But, like other"
11683,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"places, it is not on the site of its prototype. For Æolus gives Ulysses"
11684,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"a Zephyr or north-west wind, which would have carried him home, had it"
11685,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"not been for the folly of his comrades (Od. x. 25, 46). The Æolia of"
11686,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Homer then must conform to these two conditions:
11687,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11688,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,1. It must lie north-west of Ithaca.
11689,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11690,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,2. There must be a continuous open sea between them; and one
11691,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"uninterrupted by land, so that one and the same wind may carry a ship"
11692,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,all the way.
11693,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11694,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"To meet these conditions, we have only to move Æolia northward. For the"
11695,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,northern part of Italy has no existence in the Outer Geography. It is
11696,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"swept away, along with the great mass of the European continent, and"
11697,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the θάλασσα covers all.
11698,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11699,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"After the opening of the bag (x. 48, 54) the ship is driven back by a"
11700,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,θύελλα upon Æolia. But here we have had another valuable indication.
11701,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"They had enjoyed the Zephyr nine full days, and they were in sight of"
11702,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"home on the tenth (v. 28, 9), when the folly was committed. Therefore"
11703,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Æolia is between nine and ten days’ sail to the north-west of Ithaca:
11704,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"or, with an allowance of fifty miles for the distance to the horizon,"
11705,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,there will be about one thousand miles between them.
11706,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11707,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,V. The fifth stage is Læstrygonia: and it is reached after seven days’
11708,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,rowing (x. 80). There is no indication of direction in the voyage: but
11709,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,we have a sure proof that the prototype of this place was far north;
11710,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"namely, that there is here perpetual day;"
11711,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11712,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,ποιμένα ποιμὴν
11713,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"ἠπύει εἰσελάων, ὁ δέ τ’ ἐξελάων ὑπακούει."
11714,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11715,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"It cannot, I think, be doubted that Homer obtained information of a"
11716,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"region displaying this natural peculiarity from Phœnician mariners,"
11717,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,who had penetrated into the German Ocean to the northward of the
11718,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"British Isles. His retentive mind has, then, made an early record of"
11719,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"this, along with so many other singular reports, out of which a large"
11720,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,proportion have been verified.
11721,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11722,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"There is another proof that we are here nearly, or rather quite, at"
11723,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the furthest bound of distance ever reached by Ulysses. For the united
11724,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"distances (1) from within sight of Ithaca to Æolia, and (2) from Æolia"
11725,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to Læstrygonia, make seventeen days, the same number occupied in a much"
11726,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,slower craft on the voyage from Ogygia to Scheria.
11727,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11728,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"It will be found, under the rules of calculation which have been"
11729,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"adopted, that we may place Læstrygonia at near seventeen hundred miles"
11730,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"from Iapygia. If we are to suppose that by the name Artacie, given to"
11731,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the fountain in Læstrygonia, he means an allusion to a place of that"
11732,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"name in the Euxine, I take this as a new sign of his dim and confused"
11733,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,extension of that sea to the westward.
11734,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11735,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"The name Læstrygonia appears to belong to a city, not to a country."
11736,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"It is τηλέπυλος, and it is also Λάμου αἰπὺ πτολίεθρον. Homer avoids"
11737,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,calling it either a land (γαίη) or an island (νῆσος). By the former
11738,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,term he sometimes designates large islands as well as portions of a
11739,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,continent. The epithet αἰπὺ points to a steep and rocky site: but
11740,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"his forbearing to fix it as continent or island seems to show, that"
11741,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"he was himself in doubt upon the point. The trait of perpetual day,"
11742,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"however, speaks most explicitly for the _bona fides_ of the tradition"
11743,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"on which the Poet proceeds, and for the latitude from whence it came:"
11744,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,and it seems far from improbable that Iceland may have been the dimly
11745,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,perceived original of Læstrygonia; of which the site in the Odyssey is
11746,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,near the actual site of Denmark.
11747,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11748,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,VI. The sixth stage is Ææa. This could only be reached by a long
11749,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,passage from Læstrygonia. The Poet has not ventured to define its
11750,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,extent or direction. But he leaves himself an ample margin by the
11751,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"declaration from the mouth of Ulysses, that he knew nothing on his"
11752,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,arrival of the latitude or longitude (Od. x. 190-2): and he is content
11753,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"with planting it immovably near the point of sunrise, though with a"
11754,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,great vagueness of conception (Od. x. 135-9; xii. 1-4).
11755,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11756,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,There is indeed something near a verbal contradiction between the
11757,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"declaration of Ulysses in Od. x., that he, being then at Ææa, did not"
11758,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"know where to look for sunrise or for sunset, and his narrative in"
11759,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"xii. 3, 4, where he so directly associates the island with the land of"
11760,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,sunrise. But he had remained there a full year in friendly company with
11761,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Circe (x. 466-9), and he was instructed by her as to his movements,"
11762,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"so that we may, I presume, fairly consider that during that time he"
11763,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,learned what on his first arrival was strange to him.
11764,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11765,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,The course from Læstrygonia to Ææa is _primâ facie_ conjectural: but
11766,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"it is not really so, for Læstrygonia is fixed by the times and winds"
11767,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,from Hypereia; and Ææa is practically determined by its local relations
11768,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to Ocean-mouth, Thrinacie, and the Bosphorus."
11769,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11770,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"The Euxine does not abound in islands, such as we might appropriate to"
11771,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Circe and the Sirens: for it is little likely that a rock like the Isle
11772,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of Serpents, which on a recent occasion acquired a momentary notoriety,"
11773,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,should have been noticed particularly in the navigation of the heroic
11774,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"age. It is much more likely, that Homer brought his islands for the"
11775,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Euxine from among the materials provided by his western traditions. We
11776,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,may however reasonably presume that Homer meant to place Ææa at the
11777,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"east end of the Euxine, not far perhaps from the Colchis of Æetes: and"
11778,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"in that neighbourhood I shall venture to deposit three islands, vaguely"
11779,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"corresponding with the Baleares, which may have been transplanted"
11780,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,into this vicinity together with the other traditions of the western
11781,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Ocean-mouth.
11782,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11783,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"(1) From hence, under the directions of Circe, they sail for one day"
11784,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"with a toward breeze, to the Ocean-mouth, hard by that abode of the"
11785,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Cimmerians, which is wrapt in perpetual mist and night (Od. xi. 1-19)."
11786,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Circe promised them the aid of Boreas, when Ulysses, alarmed at the"
11787,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"unusual journey he was to make, asked who would guide him. I therefore"
11788,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"infer that Boreas was to blow not before, but after, they had entered"
11789,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the Ocean-mouth, and was to carry them up the stream. Before reaching"
11790,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"it, we may assume that, as usual on his way outwards, he was sailing"
11791,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,with a wind from some southern quarter.
11792,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11793,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"(2) In the Ocean-river, they haul their vessel high and dry, and"
11794,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,proceed by land up the stream to the mouth of the Shades or under-world

11796,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11797,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"(3) From the mouth of the Shades they return to their ship, and in it"
11798,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"down (κατὰ) the Ocean stream, and to the Ææan island. They go first by"
11799,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"rowing, and then by a favourable breeze, of which the direction is not"
11800,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,mentioned (Od. xi. 638-40; xii. 1-3: also xxiii. 322-5.)
11801,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,

11803,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"quarter is not named, nor is the distance, but from the terms of the"
11804,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"passages it would appear to have been very short. (Od. xii. 149-54,"
11805,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"165-7; also 39, and xxiii. 326.)"
11806,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11807,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"VIII. Avoiding the Πλαγκταὶ, the hero passes between Scylla and"
11808,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Charybdis, to Thrinacie, the island of the Sun. The strait is reached"
11809,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"forthwith, αὐτίκα (Od. xii. 201), after leaving the island, and"
11810,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Thrinacie is reached forthwith in like manner (αὐτίκα v. 261) after
11811,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"leaving the strait (Od. xi. 106, 7; xii. 262; xxiii. 327-9. The last"
11812,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,passage appears to place the Πλαγκταὶ and the Scylla passage close
11813,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"together, as it says that he came to them both, though he passed only"
11814,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,through Scylla).
11815,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11816,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"In Thrinacie he is detained by Notus, blowing for a month, and by"
11817,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the total absence of any wind but Notus and Eurus. The common point
11818,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of these winds is, that they are chiefly in the southern hemisphere."
11819,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Also it would seem from this part of the Fourth Book that Boreas was
11820,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,evidently the wind that Ulysses required to help him forward on his way
11821,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"home, rather than Zephyrus: for it was the latter wind that caught them"
11822,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"when they were already on their passage, and brought the hurricane in"
11823,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,which the ship went to pieces (Od. xii. 408).
11824,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11825,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Accordingly, as the Bosphorus is geographically fixed, I place"

11827,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11828,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"It will be observed that, after allowance is made for too much northing"
11829,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"in the north coast of the Propontis, the mouth of Scylla will be at"
11830,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the point, from which a N. N. E. wind would have brought Ulysses to the"
11831,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Dardanelles, and would thus have placed him, by the shortest cut, at"
11832,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the very gate of the Ægæan, and of the known route to his home."
11833,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11834,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"The Crimea has so much the character of an island, and its"
11835,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,south-eastern face appears to be both in scenery and climate so
11836,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"delightful, while again its proximity to the Ocean-mouth of the Odyssey"
11837,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"is so suitable, that we might be tempted to consider it as representing"
11838,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the abode of the Sirens. But it is too large for one of Homer’s νῆσοι.
11839,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Probably, too, the isle of Sirens should lie on the direct route from"
11840,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Ææa to the Straits.
11841,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11842,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"IX. When out of sight of the island (403), the ship encounters a"
11843,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"violent Ζέφυρος, and founders. Ulysses mounts on a couple of spars"
11844,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,(424). In one night Notus drifts him upon the passage of Scylla and
11845,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Charybdis, which he traverses in safety (427-30, 442-6), and then"
11846,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"drifting on, apparently with the same wind, he reaches, on the tenth"
11847,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"day, the island of Calypso, Ὠγυγίη νῆσος (xii. 447, 8; xxiii. 333),"
11848,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,which is the ὄμφαλος or central point of the θάλασσα (Od. i. 50): that
11849,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"is to say which, as nearly due north from Greece, not only is conceived"
11850,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to be alike removed from the supposed eastern and western Ocean, but"

11854,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Φαιήκων (Od. v. 345). Leaving Ogygia on his raft (v. 263 and seqq.),"
11855,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"he keeps Arctos set on his right, and looking towards his left hand,"
11856,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"till on the eighteenth day (v. 278), he arrives in sight of Scheria."
11857,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Neptune, coming up from among the Ethiopians, discerns him afar, from"
11858,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the Solyman mountains (282). The storm rises, and the raft is tossed in"
11859,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"a hurricane of all the winds (293 and 331, 2). At length it founders"
11860,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"(370): Minerva sends a brisk Boreas, and the hero drifts to Scheria,"
11861,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,arriving on the third day (382-98). Homer gives to Scheria the name
11862,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of ἤπειρος (Od. v. 348, 50); and it does not appear clear that he"
11863,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"considered it as an island. At the same time, the term ἤπειρος may mean"
11864,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the shore: and the word γαίη may be used, like Κρήτη τις γαί’ ἐστιν, for"
11865,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"an island, if it be presumed to be of extraordinary size."

11875,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,We have however still to consider the directions and distances of the
11876,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"tour, from Ææa onwards, on the way home."
11877,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11878,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Homer plainly intends to describe very short passages, first to the"
11879,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"island of the Sirens, next from that island to Scylla, and then from"
11880,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Scylla to the landing on the coast of Thrinacie. They are not defined:
11881,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,but they by no means correspond with the very considerable eastward
11882,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,stretch of the Euxine from the Bosphorus.
11883,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11884,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,It has already been observed that Homer shortens the eastern recess of
11885,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the Mediterranean, and brings Egypt nearly to the southward of Crete:"
11886,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,and that this is part of a system of compression which abbreviates
11887,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,all the distances of his Outer geography eastward from Lycia. We have
11888,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,now come to another example of the working of this idea in his mind:
11889,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"placing Ææa and the Sirens so near the Bosphorus, he plainly curtails"
11890,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the eastward Euxine, like the eastward Mediterranean."
11891,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11892,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Ten days floatage northwards from Scylla would give us a distance of
11893,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"nearly five hundred miles in that direction, up to the point where we"
11894,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,should fix the island of Calypso.
11895,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11896,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"But from Ogygia to within sight of Scheria, Ulysses occupies eighteen"
11897,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,days in sailing by raft: which will give us for the whole distance
11898,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"at sixty miles _per diem_, with an allowance of fifty miles, as the"
11899,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"distance from which Ithaca had become visible, about eleven hundred and"
11900,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"thirty miles. We have also to consider the further question, how far"
11901,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Scheria is to be placed from Ithaca. We must reckon the time occupied
11902,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,by the hawk-like ship at not less than sixteen hours; and we cannot
11903,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,reckon the distance below one hundred and eighty or ninety miles.
11904,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Thus Ogygia ought to be reckoned at fully thirteen hundred miles from
11905,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Ithaca. Læstrygonia is, as we have found, nearly seventeen hundred from"
11906,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Ithaca. And the site of Ogygia will be upon the point which is both
11907,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,at the distance of five hundred miles from the Homeric or transposed
11908,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Scylla, and of eleven hundred and thirty miles from the Homeric"
11909,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Scheria. This point will, I think, lie a little to the west of the real"
11910,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,site of Kieff.
11911,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11912,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,The actual distance from Ithaca to the middle point of Corfu may be
11913,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,about eighty miles. Corfu is said to resemble in its natural features
11914,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the Scheria of Homer. But if this be admitted, we must remove the site"
11915,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,of the island in the direction of Dalmatia to more than double its real
11916,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"distance from Ithaca, so as to satisfy the conditions of the Phæacian"
11917,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"voyage. It will then be near the point where we may, consistently with"
11918,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"all the representations of Homer, cut off the Greek peninsula, and"
11919,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,substitute for the northward land the great spaces of his sea.
11920,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11921,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"The island of Calypso, thus determined, will satisfy in a great degree"
11922,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the conditions of the ὄμφαλος θαλάσσης. It may be nearly equidistant
11923,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"from Ææa and the Cimmerian country in the south-east, from Scylla in"
11924,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the south, and from the possible extension of the Cimmerian country"
11925,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,to the north. Towards Æolia and Læstrygonia on the west the distances
11926,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,will indeed be greater; but as among very great distances Homer may
11927,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,naturally fail to maintain the close measurements of small ones.

11937,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"built an Universe of Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise. Every line of his"
11938,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"poem has a determinate relation to a certain point in space, fixed in"
11939,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,his own mind; but whether every such point be fixed or not in nature
11940,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"is no more material, than if it were simply one to be determined by"
11941,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"axes of coordinates. Intricate as the fabric is, this great brother"
11942,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,of Homer in his art never for a moment lets drop the thread of his
11943,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"labyrinth, but holds it steadily from the beginning of the first canto"
11944,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to the end of the hundredth. Homer, composing for a younger world, had"
11945,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to deal with all ideas whatsoever in simpler forms; but, I think, it is"
11946,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"discernible that in his way he, too, made a systematic distribution of"
11947,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the Outer Earth, as he had rather vaguely conceived it in his teeming"
11948,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,imagination.
11949,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
11950,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"We are apt to forget, from the comparatively summary manner in which"
11951,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the subject is dismissed by the Poet, that the voyages and travels of"
11952,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Menelaus occupy a time almost as long as those of Ulysses. He has but
11953,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"recently returned, says Nestor to Telemachus, in the last year of his"
11954,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"father’s wanderings[628]: and Menelaus himself states, that he came"
11955,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,home only in the eighth year after the capture of Troy[629]. And as in
11956,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"point of time, so likewise they are geographically in correspondence."
11957,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"To Menelaus Homer has given, in outline, the southern world from east"
11958,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to west, and to Ulysses, in detail, the northern world from west to"
11959,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"east. It is true that he made Ulysses begin his Wanderings, properly"
11960,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"so called, with the Lotophagi in Africa: but this is because it was"
11961,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"necessary to throw him at Malea, by some wide and irrecoverable"
11962,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"deviation, off his route to Ithaca. So Menelaus loses his course at"
11963,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the very same critical point, the Malean Promontory[630]. Then the two"
11964,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"strike off to the opposite ends of the diameter: Menelaus to Crete,"
11965,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"for Cyprus, Phœnicia, and Egypt, in the south-east; Ulysses to Africa,"
11966,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"for the Cyclopes, Æolia, and Læstrygonia, in the north-west. Again,"
11967,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Menelaus visits Libya to the westward, where, it will be remembered, he"
11968,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,is to find his home after death in the Elysian fields. The counterpart
11969,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,of this is in the eastward movement of Ulysses along a northern zone
11970,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to the isle of Circe, and in his visit to the Shades. Again, it is"
11971,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Phœnicia, which in the south-east forms a kind of boundary line between"
11972,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the known and the unknown world. Accordingly Homer has given us an
11973,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"idealized Phœnicia on the north-western line. Perhaps only partial,"
11974,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"but still perfectly real, resemblances of character establish a"
11975,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,poetical relation between the Φοίνικες and the Φαίηκες. Other parts
11976,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,of the Phæacian character might seem to have been borrowed from the
11977,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Egyptians. No one, I think, can doubt that Homer had the Phœnicians"
11978,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to some extent in his mind, when he invented the Phæacians. But he has"
11979,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,given us another etymological sign of the connection. The Φοίνικες
11980,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,stand in evident connection with Συρίη[631]. Who but they could give
11981,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,that name to the island where Eumæus was born? an island with which
11982,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"we see them to have been in relations by a double token; the first, a"
11983,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Phœnician slave carried thither by the Taphians; and the second, Eumæus"
11984,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"as a boy carried off thence by the Phœnicians, who had paid it a visit"
11985,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"with a cargo of fine goods. The island of Ψυρίη, lying north-west from"
11986,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Chios, probably owed its title to the same source: if not also Σκῦρος,"
11987,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"corrupted from Συρός. Surely then, like Φαίηκες from Φοίνικες, so Homer"
11988,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,made Σχερίη from Συρίη. It being always remembered that Scheria is for
11989,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Homer, like Phœnicia, a maritime land. It is nowhere called an island;"
11990,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"from which we know, that Homer either believed it to be attached to the"
11991,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"continent, or to form, like Crete[632], a continent of itself."

12000,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"see Wood on Homer, pp. 9-16; but surely without need. We have"
12001,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"no occasion to translate καθύπερθε into _trans_, πέρην, or"
12002,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"_beyond_. The Συρίη νῆσος, or Syros, has the same bearing in respect"
12003,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to Delos, as Ψυρίη in respect to Chios, which is called καθύπερθε"
12004,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Χίοιο, Od. iii. 170. It may perhaps mean _to windward_, and this would"
12005,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,correspond with the idea of Ζέφυρος as the prevailing wind
12006,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,of the Ægæan. Another difficulty is made about the phrase ὅθι τροπαὶ
12007,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"ἠελίοιο, which is interpreted as describing the position relatively"
12008,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to Delos. I know not why this should constitute a difficulty at all,"
12009,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,if Syros is to the west and north of Delos. But there would be no
12010,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"difficulty, even if Delos were west of Syros: for the words ὅθι τροπαὶ"

12019,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,have a counterpart in the Cimmerians of the north. In the same zone
12020,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"with the Æthiopes, on the borders of Ocean to the south, a passage of"

12022,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"in this, as in most other particulars. And the researches of the most"

12031,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"final passage to Elysium, cover the entire surface of the earth, such"
12032,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"as Homer had conceived it. This, however, can only be taken generally,"
12033,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,and tells us little of what Homer thought concerning the actual form
12034,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of the earth’s surface, while it leaves untouched various questions"
12035,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,regarding its distribution in detail. With some of these let us now
12036,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,endeavour to deal.
12037,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
12038,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"And first, what was Homer’s belief concerning the form of the earth?"

12040,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,~_Earth of Homer probably oval._~
12041,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
12042,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,The passage of the poems which bears most directly upon the solution of
12043,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,this question is that which describes the Shield of Achilles. We here
12044,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"learn that, in finishing his work, Vulcan gave it the great River Ocean"
12045,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"for a border[634]. From this it follows conclusively, that the form of"
12046,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the Shield was that which Homer also conceived to be nearest to the
12047,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,form of the surface of the Earth.
12048,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
12049,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,[634] Il. xviii. 607.
12050,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
12051,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"The question then arises, what was the form of the Shields treated of"
12052,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,by Homer? And it is one not easy to answer. Homer compares the light of
12053,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,this very Shield of Achilles in a subsequent passage to that of the
12054,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"moon[635]: but he does not say the full moon, and the moon in certain"
12055,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"stages might suggest the oval, although when full it would require the"
12056,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,circular shape. The epithets which he uses do not solve the question:
12057,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"for some of them appear to agree better with the one supposition, and"
12058,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"some with the other. The ἄσπις ἀμφιβρότη, for instance, in Il. xi."
12059,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"32, suggests a shape adapted in a great degree to that of the human"
12060,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,form. The ποδηνεκὴς of Il. xv. 646 appears absolutely to require it.
12061,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"No circular shield, which reached down to the feet, could have been"
12062,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"carried on the arm. But, on the other hand, Homer calls the shield"
12063,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"εὔκυκλος[636] and παντόσε ἴση, which certainly at first sight favour"
12064,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the idea of a circular form. Shall we then suppose that both forms

12108,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"It would not be satisfactory to assume that the two forms prevailed,"

12112,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"It follows that such was, in Homer’s estimation, the form of the world."

12114,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the subject.
12115,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
12116,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"We must, I think, take Homer to have supposed something like an equal"
12117,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"extension of the earth northward and southward from Greece. But,"
12118,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,whether we judge from the Tours of the Odyssey or from the general
12119,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"indications of the poems, we have, I think, no sign of an extension"
12120,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,correspondingly great either eastward or westward. The flights of
12121,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"migratory birds, and the prevailing winds, are both evidently from"
12122,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the poles or from the quarters near them. The only great positive
12123,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,developments of distance in the Odyssey are those towards Læstrygonia
12124,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"and Ogygia, both of which lie in the north; the latter, as an ὄμφαλος,"
12125,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"with a sea stretching far beyond it. All appearances, too, go to show"
12126,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,that the Eastern Ocean was in Homer’s view at no great distance; and I
12127,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,apprehend we should consider the Western one as being on his map about
12128,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,equally remote from Greece. Now the oval figure will give us what we
12129,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"thus appear to want, namely a shorter diameter of the earth from east"
12130,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to west, than the diameter from north to south. Some other particulars"

12158,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,This noble conception of a great circumfluent River was doubtless
12159,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,founded upon reports of two classes which had reached Homer. One
12160,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,class would be reports of streams flowing from some great outer water
12161,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"into the _Thalassa_, and seeming to feed it. The other class might be"
12162,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"formed by reports of waters outside the _Thalassa_, and not known to"
12163,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"communicate with it, which Homer would at once very naturally reckon"
12164,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,as portions of his great world-embracing Stream. With the former
12165,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,class we have already dealt largely in discussing the Ocean-mouth.
12166,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"To the latter one, Phœnician sailors might contribute reports of the"
12167,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Atlantic and German Oceans. And particularly in the east, I think, we"
12168,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"cannot doubt that, along with the rumours and traditions of Arabians,"
12169,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Ethiopians, Persians, and Cimmerians, Homer cannot but have received"
12170,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,other vague rumours of waters as well as lands; of waters exterior
12171,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to his _Thalassa_ (which included the Mediterranean and the Euxine),"
12172,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"waters of which two would clearly be the Caspian Sea, and the Persian"
12173,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Gulf. On these two I wish to fix attention; and indeed the only other
12174,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,water he was likely to have heard of would probably be the Red Sea.
12175,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Now it will be observed upon any map, 1. that the Caspian lies north"
12176,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,and south; 2. that a line prolonged from N. to S. down the Caspian
12177,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"will strike the Persian Gulf. In conjunction with this, let the reader"
12178,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"observe the course of Ulysses. Quitting the Euxine at the Ocean-mouth,"
12179,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"or Straits of Yenikalè, he turns round to the right by the Sea of Azof,"
12180,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,enlarged so as to join the Caspian. In the interval between them there
12181,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"is still a low salt valley, which may in Homer’s time have been a"
12182,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,water-way[645]. He is thus in a condition to proceed southward towards
12183,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the dwelling of Persephone, which I have already shown some cause for"
12184,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"placing in the east and to the south. Now the provision of wind, which"
12185,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Homer has made for his hero, is precisely that which this hypothesis"
12186,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,requires[646]:

12196,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"quarter as from south to north, or thereabouts; and this is the line"
12197,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"actually formed by the junction of the Persian gulf and the Caspian,"
12198,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,which I submit that we may accordingly with propriety consider as
12199,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"genuine fragments of geography, incorporated into his fabulous"

12201,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
12202,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"It is indeed true that the vague accounts, which had probably reached"
12203,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Homer of these two waters, must be supposed not to have included the"
12204,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"indispensable element of a current. The same remark, however, will"
12205,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,apply to whatever he may have heard of the German or Atlantic Oceans.
12206,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"But in dealing with these shadowy distances, his inference would be"
12207,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"amply warranted, without the means of complete identification, if he"
12208,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,had heard of any waters in positions agreeing with that of his ideal

12212,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,One word before we finally quit the subject of the enchanted River; in
12213,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,order to complete the chain of connection between the Persephone of
12214,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Homer and the waters of the Persian gulf, in the character of a part of"
12215,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Ocean, at that point upon the beach, which so well balances the Elysian"
12216,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,plain in the west.
12217,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
12218,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"I have already endeavoured to make use of the names Perseus, Perse,"
12219,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"and Persephone, as evidences which attach the Persians to the eastern"
12220,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"extremity of Homer’s ideal world, and which connect the Greek race"
12221,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"with a Persian origin. But here we have a geographical trait, which"
12222,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,deserves further consideration. The groves of Persephone are on the
12223,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"shore of Ocean, in the east, and to the south of the sunrise. What is"
12224,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the meaning of these groves? We are compelled, by unvarying analogies"
12225,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of signification, to understand them as both the symbols and the sites"
12226,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of a certain organized worship, which was paid to Persephone. But if"
12227,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"paid, then paid by whom? Certainly not by the nations of the dead: for"
12228,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the place, where these groves were, was not within the kingdom of the"
12229,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"goddess, but it was on the shore of Ocean. Ulysses, too, was to haul up"
12230,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"his ship there, and only then to enter into the abode of king Aidoneus."
12231,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"It therefore seems to follow, that the Poet meant us to understand this"
12232,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,as a place where Persephone was habitually worshipped by a portion of
12233,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the human race, which could only be his Persians or his Ethiopians. I"
12234,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,do not say that the two were sharply severed in his mind; but here the
12235,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,race to which he chiefly points appears to be the Persian race[647].

12252,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Next let me wind up what relates to the contraction and compression of
12253,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the Homeric East.
12254,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
12255,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Homer’s experience did not supply him with any example of a great
12256,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"expanse of land: but the detail and configuration of the countries,"
12257,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"with which he was acquainted, was minute. This probably was the reason"
12258,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,why he so readily assumed the existence of that sea to the northward
12259,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of Thrace, in which he has placed the adventures of Ulysses. To that"
12260,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"sea, as we perceive from the terms of days which he has assigned to"
12261,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the passages of Ulysses, he attached his ideas and his epithets for"
12262,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"vastness; epithets, which he never bestowed on regions of land; and"
12263,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"ideas, which were sure, indeed, to form a prominent feature in the"
12264,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Phœnician reports, that must have supplied him with material. Acting on"
12265,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the same principle, it would appear that he greatly shortens the range"
12266,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,of Asia Minor eastwards. Through the medium of the Solymi (Il. vi.
12267,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"184, 204) he appears to bring the Solyman mountains close upon Lycia."
12268,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,A chain now bearing that name skirts the right bank of the Indus: but
12269,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"it is probable that Homer identified, or rather confounded, them with"
12270,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the great chain of the Caucasus between the Euxine and the Caspian,"
12271,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"and with the Taurus joining it, and bordering upon Lycia: for, on the"
12272,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"one hand, we cannot but connect them with the Solymi, the warlike"
12273,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"neighbours of the Lycians: and on the other, since Neptune, from these"
12274,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"mountains, sees Ulysses making his homeward voyage from Ogygia, it"
12275,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,follows that they must have been conceived by Homer to command a clear
12276,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"view of the Euxine, and of its westward extension. Thus he at once"
12277,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,brings Egypt nearer to Crete (helping us to explain the Boreas of Od.
12278,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"xiv. 253), and Phœnicia nearer to Lycia: and it is in all likelihood"
12279,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,immediately behind Phœnicia that he imagined to lie the country of the
12280,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Persians and the ἄλσεα Περσεφονείης (Od. x. 507), on the shore of that"
12281,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"eastern portion of Oceanus, for which the reports both of the Caspian"
12282,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"and of the Red Sea, probably, as we have seen, have formed parts of his"
12283,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,materials. Thus we find much and varied evidence converging to support
12284,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the hypothesis, that Homer greatly compressed his East, and brought"
12285,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Persia within moderate distance of the Mediterranean.
12286,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
12287,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"In the obscure perspectives of Grecian legend, we seem to find various"
12288,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"points of contact between Egypt, Phœnicia, and Persia; and each of"
12289,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,these points of contact favours the idea that Persia and Phœnicia were
12290,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,closely associated in Homer’s mind.
12291,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
12292,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"Proteus, a Phœnician sea-god, is placed only at a short distance from"
12293,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the Egyptian coast. Helios, strongly associated with Egypt through his"
12294,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"oxen, is associated with Phœnicia and with the remoter east by his"
12295,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"relationship to Circe, and by his residence, the ἀντολαὶ Ἠελίοιο. And"
12296,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"again, from the family of Danaus, a reputed Egyptian, descends Perseus,"
12297,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,in whose name we find a note of relationship between the Persians and
12298,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the Greeks. Lycia, too, is near the Solymi, and the Solyman hills are"
12299,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,really Persian. Here is a new ray of light cast on Homer’s passion for
12300,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,the Lycians of the War[649].
12301,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
12302,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"[649] See Achæis, sect. iii."
12303,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
12304,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,A few words more will suffice to complete a probable view of the
12305,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,terrestrial system of Homer.
12306,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
12307,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,The Ocean surrounds the earth. On its south-eastern beach are
12308,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the groves of Persephone, and the descent to the Shades: on its"
12309,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"north-western, the Elysian plain. The whole southern range between is"
12310,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"occupied by the Αἰθίοπες, who stretch from the rising to the setting"
12311,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,sun[650]. The natural counterpart in the cold north to their sun-burnt
12312,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"swarthy faces is to be found in the Cimmerians, Homer’s Children of"
12313,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the Mist[651]. Accordingly, they are placed by the Ocean mouth, hard"
12314,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"by the island of Circe and the Dawn; nearly in contact, therefore,"
12315,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,with the Ethiopians of the extreme east. Two hypotheses seem to be
12316,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,suggested by Homer’s treatment of the north. Perhaps Homer imagined
12317,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,that the Cimmerians occupied the northern portion of the earth
12318,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"from east to west, as the Ethiopians occupied the southern: a very"
12319,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,appropriate conjecture for the disposal of the country from the Crimea
12320,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"to the Cwmri. On the other hand, it seems plain that Homer must have"
12321,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"received from his Phœnician informants two reports, both ascribed to"
12322,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the North, yet apparently contradictory: the one of countries without"
12323,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"day, the other of countries without night. The true solution, could"
12324,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"he have known it, was by time; each being true of the same place, but"
12325,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"at different seasons of the year. Not aware of the facts, Homer has"
12326,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,adopted another method. While preserving the northern locality for both
12327,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"traditions, he has planted the one in the north-west, at the craggy"
12328,THE OUTER GEOGRAPHY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"city of Lamus; and the other in the north-east, together with his"

12373,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"In former portions of this work, I have argued from the name and"
12374,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"the Phœnician extraction of Minos, both to illustrate the dependent"
12375,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"position of the Pelasgian race in the Greek countries[652], and"
12376,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,also to demonstrate the Phœnician origin of the Outer Geography
12377,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,of the Odyssey[653]. But I have too summarily disposed of the
12378,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"important question, whether Minos was of Phœnician origin, and of"
12379,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,the construction of the verse Il. xiv. 321. This verse is capable
12380,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,grammatically of being so construed as to contain an assertion of it;
12381,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,but upon further consideration I am not prepared to maintain that it
12382,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,ought to be so interpreted.

12390,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,The Alexandrian critics summarily condemned the whole passage (Il.
12391,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"xiv. 317-27), in which Jupiter details to Juno his various affairs"
12392,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"with goddesses and women. ‘This enumeration,’ says the Scholiast (A)"
12393,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"on verse 327, ‘is inopportune, for it rather repels Juno than attracts"
12394,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"her: and Jupiter, when greedy, through the influence of the Cestus, for"
12395,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"the satisfaction of his passion, makes a long harangue.’ Heyne follows"
12396,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"up the censure with a yet more sweeping condemnation. _Sanè absurdiora,"
12397,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"quam hos decem versus, vix unquam ullus commentus est rhapsodus_[654]."
12398,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"And yet he adds a consideration, which might have served to"
12399,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"arrest judgment until after further hearing. For he says, that the"
12400,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,commentators upon them ought to have taken notice that the description
12401,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"belongs to a period, when the relations of man and wife were not such,"
12402,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,as to prevent the open introduction and parading of concubines; and
12403,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"that Juno might be flattered and allured by a declaration, proceeding"
12404,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"from Jupiter, of the superiority of her charms to those of so many"
12405,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,beautiful persons.

12409,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"Heyne’s reason appears to me so good, as even to outweigh his"
12410,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"authority: but there are other grounds also, on which I decline to bow"
12411,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,to the proposed excision. The objections taken seem to me invalid on
12412,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,the following grounds;
12413,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,
12414,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,1. For the reason stated by Heyne.
12415,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,
12416,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"2. Because, in the whole character of the Homeric Juno, and in the"
12417,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"whole of this proceeding, it is the political spirit, and not the"
12418,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"animal tendency, that predominates. Of this Homer has given us distinct"
12419,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"warning, where he tells us that Juno just before had looked on Jupiter"
12420,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"from afar, and that he was disgusting to her; (v. 158) στυγερὸς δέ"
12421,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"οἱ ἔπλετο θυμῷ. It is therefore futile to argue about her, as if she"
12422,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"had been under the paramount sway either of animal desire, or even of"
12423,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"the feminine love of admiration, when she was really and exclusively"
12424,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,governed by another master-passion.
12425,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,
12426,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"3. As she has artfully persuaded Jupiter, that he has an obstacle"
12427,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,to overcome in diverting her from her intention of travelling to a
12428,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"distance, it is not at all unnatural that Jupiter should use what he"
12429,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"thinks, and what, as Heyne has shown, he may justly think, to be proper"
12430,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,and special means of persuasion.
12431,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,
12432,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,4. The passage is carefully and skilfully composed; and it ends with a
12433,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"climax, so as to give the greatest force to the compliment of which it"
12434,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,is susceptible.
12435,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,
12436,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,5. All the representations in it harmonize with the manner of handling
12437,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,the same personages elsewhere in Homer.
12438,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,
12439,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"6. The passage has that strong vein of nationality, which is so"
12440,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"eminently characteristic of Homer. No intrigues are mentioned, except"
12441,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,such as issued in the birth of children of recognised Hellenic fame.
12442,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"The gross animalism of Jupiter, displayed in the Speech, is in the"
12443,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,strictest keeping with the entire context; for it is the basis of the
12444,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"transaction, and gives Juno the opportunity she so adroitly turns to"
12445,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,account.
12446,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,
12447,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"7. Those, who reject the passage as spurious, because the action"
12448,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"ought not at this point to be loaded with a speech, do not, I think,"
12449,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,bear in mind that a deviation of this kind from the strict poetical
12450,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"order is really in keeping with Homer’s practice on other occasions,"
12451,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,particularly in the disquisitions of Nestor and of Phœnix. Such
12452,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,a deviation appears to be accounted for by his historic aims. To
12453,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"comprehend him in a case of this kind, we must set out from his point"
12454,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"of departure, according to which, verse was not a mere exercise for"
12455,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"pleasure, but was to be the one great vehicle of all knowledge: and a"
12456,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"potent instrument in constructing a nationality. Thus, then, what the"
12457,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"first aim rejected, the second might in given cases accept and even"
12458,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,require. Now in this short passage there is a great deal of important
12459,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,historical information conveyed to us.
12460,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,
12461,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,We may therefore with considerable confidence employ such evidence as

12493,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,

12509,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"in this place in any other manner, than as the name of the father of"
12510,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,Minos.
12511,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,
12512,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"The name Φοίνιξ, however, taken in connection with the period to"
12513,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,which it applies--nearly three generations before the _Troica_--still
12514,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,continues to supply of itself no trifling presumption of the Phœnician
12515,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,origin of Minos.
12516,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,
12517,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"It cannot, I suppose, be doubted that the original meaning of Φοίνιξ,"
12518,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"when first used as a proper name in Greece, probably was ‘of Phœnician"
12519,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"birth, or origin.’ But, if we are to judge by the testimony of Homer,"
12520,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"the time, when Minos lived, was but very shortly after the first"
12521,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"Phœnician arrivals in Greece; and his grandfather Phœnix, living four"
12522,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"and a half generations before the _Troica_, was in all likelihood"
12523,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"contemporary with, or anterior to, Cadmus. At a period when the"
12524,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"intercourse of the two countries was in its infancy, we may, I think,"
12525,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,with some degree of confidence construe this proper name as indicating
12526,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,the country of origin.

12532,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"certainty. Such are,"
12533,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,
12534,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,1. The connection with Dædalus.
12535,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,

12537,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,

12540,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,
12541,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,4. The fact that Minos brought a more advanced form of laws and polity
12542,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,among a people of lower social organization; the proof thus given that
12543,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"he belonged to a superior race: the probability that, if this race"
12544,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"had been Hellenic, Homer would have distinctly marked the connection"
12545,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,of so distinguished a person with the Hellenic stem: and the apparent
12546,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"certainty that, if not Hellenic, it could only be Phœnician."
12547,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,
12548,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,The positive Homeric grounds for believing Minos to be Phœnician are
12549,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"much stronger, than any that sustain the same belief in the case of"
12550,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"Cadmus: and the negative objection, that Homer does not call him by"
12551,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"the name of the country from which he sprang, is in fact an indication"
12552,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,of the Poet’s uniform practice of drawing the curtain over history or
12553,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"legend, at the point where a longer perspective would have the effect"
12554,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"of exhibiting any Greek hero as derived from a foreign source, and thus"
12555,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"of confuting that claim to autochthonism which, though it is not much"
12556,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,"his way to proclaim such matters in the abstract, yet appears to have"
12557,ON THE PARENTAGE AND EXTRACTION OF MINOS.,operated with Homer as a practical principle of considerable weight.

12585,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,
12586,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,1. The meaning of the important Homeric word ἀριστερός.
12587,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,
12588,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"2. The form of the phrase ἀριστερὰ χειρὸς, which is an ἅπαξ λεγόμενον"

12590,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,
12591,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"3. The force of the preposition ἐπὶ, particularly with the accusative."
12592,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,
12593,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,The second of these points may be speedily dismissed. For (1) the only
12594,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"question that can arise upon it would be, whether (assuming for the"
12595,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,moment the sense of ἀριστερὸς) ‘the left of his hand’ means the left of
12596,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"the line described by the onward movement of his body, or the left of"
12597,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"the direction in which his hand, that is, his right or steering hand,"
12598,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,points while upon the helm; which would be the exact reverse of the
12599,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"former. But, though the latter interpretation would be grammatically"
12600,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"accurate, it is too minute and subtle, as respects the sense, to agree"
12601,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,with Homer’s methods of expression. And (2) some of the Scholiasts

12604,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,

12773,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,
12774,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,Now ἐπ’ ἀριστερὰ is commonly interpreted ‘on the left.’ But if it means
12775,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"on the left in Il. xiii., then the passages are contradictory: because"
12776,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"this would place Paris on both wings, whereas he obviously is described"

12778,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,
12779,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,But if we construe ἀριστερὸς as meaning the west in all the three

12781,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"the three places, so that the account becomes self-consistent again;"

12896,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"meaning. The sense seems to be, that Andromache was holding her infant"

12898,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,from the opposite side. The idea of an infant _on_ her breast is quite
12899,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,unsuited to a figure declared to be in motion. But the sense may also
12900,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"be, stretched over or across her breast. Thus we always have extension"
12901,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"involved in ἐπὶ with the accusative, whether in range of view or sound,"

12920,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"Let us, however, consider the meaning of the latter passage, which is"
12921,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"indisputable. It is ‘hold or keep us,’ not on the left, but ‘towards,"
12922,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"looking and moving towards, the left of the army.’ Probably then they"
12923,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"were coming from its right. Therefore, if for the moment we waive the"

12931,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"phrase itself. Now, it seems to be the essential and very peculiar"
12932,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"characteristic of this phrase in Homer, and of the sister phrases"
12933,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"ἐπιδέξια (whether written in one word or in two) and ἐνδέξια, that they"
12934,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,very commonly imply a position different from that which they seem
12935,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,at first sight to suggest. For that which goes towards the left is

12937,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,
12938,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,‘To’ and not ‘on’ is the essential characteristic of the Homeric ἐπὶ

12940,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"δεξιὰ or ἀριστερὰ, we may often understand an original position of the"
12941,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"person or thing intended, generally opposite to the point or quarter"
12942,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,expressed. In such a case as εὗρεν ... μάχης ἐπ’ ἀριστερὰ we should

12950,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"of passages will, I believe, supply us with instances to show, that"
12951,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,there is no other consistent mode of rendering the phrases ἀστράπτειν
12952,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"ἐπιδέξια; ἐέργειν ἐπ’ ἀριστερά; οἰνοχόειν, αἰτεῖν, δεικνύναι, ἐνδέξια;"

12954,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,
12955,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,And although in some of these phrases the idea of motion is actually
12956,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"included, while the motion of omens was the original groundwork of them"
12957,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"all, yet, as frequently happens, the effect remains when the cause has"
12958,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"disappeared. A bird called δεξιὸς is one moving ἐπὶ δεξιά; and this,"
12959,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"according to the law of omens, is _usually_ a bird from the left moving"
12960,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"towards the right. And thus, by analogy, a star ἐπ’ ἀριστερὰ is a star"
12961,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"on the right not moving but looking towards the left. Once more, when"
12962,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,we recollect that ἐπ’ ἀριστερὰ habitually or very frequently means on
12963,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"the right as well as moving towards the left, it is not difficult to"
12964,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,conceive so easy and simple a modification of this sense as brings it
12965,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"to being on the right, while also looking, instead of moving, towards"
12966,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"the left. Lightning, which had appeared on the right, would I apprehend"
12967,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,be ἀστραπὴ ἐπ’ ἀριστερά: Ἀρκτὸς ἐπ’ ἀριστερὰ would be ‘Arctus on the
12968,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,right;’ and the introduction of the word ἔχειν cannot surely reverse

13063,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,2. Motion from that point towards the left;
13064,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,3. Rest at another point on the left.

13066,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,Of these the second named indicates the first and principal intention
13067,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,of the word; but when it passes to a second intention or derivative
13068,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"sense, it may include either the first point, or the third, or both."
13069,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,In the later Greek it appears rather to indicate the point of rest;
13070,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"but in the Homeric phrases of the corresponding word δεξιὸς, οἰνοχοεῖν"
13071,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"ἐνδέξια, δεικνύναι ἐνδέξια, αἰτεῖν ἐνδέξια, ἀστραπτεῖν ἐπὶ δεξιὰ,"

13083,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,I therefore ask particular attention to the passage in the Twenty-third
13084,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"Book of the Iliad, where Nestor instructs his son concerning his"
13085,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,management in the chariot-race. On either side of a dry trunk upon the
13086,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"plain, there lay two white stones (xxiii. 329). They formed the goal,"
13087,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"round which the chariots were to be driven, the charioteer keeping them"
13088,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"on his left hand. The pith of the advice of Nestor is, that his son"
13089,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"is to make a short and close turn round them, so as to have a chance"
13090,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"of winning, in spite of the slowness of his team. The directions are"
13091,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,(335-7):
13092,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,
13093,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,αὐτὸς δὲ κλινθῆναι ἐϋπλέκτῳ ἐνὶ δίφρῳ
13094,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,ἦκ’ ἐπ’ ἀριστερὰ τοῖϊν· ἀτὰρ τὸν δεξιὸν ἵππον
13095,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"κένσαι ὁμοκλήσας, εἶξαί τέ οἱ ἡνία χερσίν."
13096,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,
13097,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,It is clear from the last line and a half that the goal was to be on
13098,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,his left hand. But what is the meaning of κλινθῆναι ἐπ’ ἀριστερὰ τοῖϊν?
13099,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,Nothing can be more scientific than the precept. The horses are to make
13100,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,a sharp turn: the impetus in the driver’s body might throw him forward
13101,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,if he were not prepared: he is to do what every rider in a circus now
13102,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"does, to lean inwards; and that is expressed by leaning ἐπ’ ἀριστερὰ,"
13103,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"of the goal--for τοῖϊν must, I apprehend, be understood to agree with"
13104,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"the dual λᾶε (329), and not the plural ἵππους (334); particularly"
13105,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,because the word ἵππος is repeated immediately after it. The meaning
13106,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"then is, that he is desired to lean to the left of the goal, while all"
13107,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,the time he keeps on its right. We should under the same circumstances
13108,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"say, ‘Lean gently towards the right side of the goal, as you are about"
13109,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"to turn round it.’ He, meaning the same thing, says, ‘Lean towards the"
13110,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"left; that is, lean _from the right_, or while keeping on the right,"
13111,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,of the object named. Now this I take to be exactly the sense of Od.
13112,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"v. 277. Ulysses was bid to sail, having the Great Bear placed on his"
13113,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"right, but looking from his right, and towards his left, as every star"
13114,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,looks towards the quarter opposite to that in which it is itself seen.
13115,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"He is to have the star _e dextrâ_, because from that point it looks _ad"
13116,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"sinistram_. It looks across him towards his left, just as Antilochus"
13117,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,was to lean in the direction across the goal towards its left.
13118,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,
13119,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,The whole of this interpretation without doubt depends upon the word
13120,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"τοῖϊν; and I do not presume to say that it is necessarily, under"
13121,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"grammatical rules, to be understood of the goal, and not of the horses."
13122,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,But it is the more natural construction: and Homer often reverts merely
13123,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"by this demonstrative pronoun, without further indication, to a subject"
13124,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,which he has only named some time back[679].
13125,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,
13126,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"[679] So τήν δε, Il. i. 127, and particularly τὴν in Il. i. 389,"
13127,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"meaning Chryseis, who has not been named since v. 372."
13128,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,
13129,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"But if grammar leave that question in any degree open, I apprehend"
13130,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,that physical considerations must decide it. It is impossible for the
13131,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,driver to lean to the left of his horses as they are rounding the goal.
13132,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"To the left of his chariot he may lean, as he stands upon it: but to"
13133,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"their left he cannot, for they are considerably in advance of him;"
13134,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"and in order to make the turn at all, they must, at each point of the"
13135,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"curve, which is a curve to the left, be much further along the curve,"
13136,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"and consequently much further to the left, than he can possibly be. It"
13137,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"would be a parallel case, if there were two riders round a circus, one"
13138,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"following the other, and the rider of the after horse were told to lean"
13139,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"to the right of the fore horse. Therefore the word τοῖϊν can, I submit,"
13140,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"only refer to the two stones, which form the goal."
13141,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,
13142,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,~_From Il._ ii. 526.~
13143,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,
13144,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,A line in the Greek Catalogue will enable us to carry the question
13145,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"still further. In Il. ii. 517, after the two Bœotian contingents, come"
13146,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"the Phocians: and the Poet says, ver. 526,"
13147,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,
13148,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,Βοιωτῶν δ’ ἔμπλην ἐπ’ ἀριστερὰ θωρήσσοντο.
13149,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,
13150,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,I see that this is translated even by Voss ‘on the left.’ Now is not
13151,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,this contrary to all likelihood? Was not all propitious movement with
13152,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,Homer from left to right? Has not this been proved by the cases of the
13153,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"Immortals, the Omens, the Cupbearer, the Beggar, and the Herald? Is it"
13154,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"likely, or is it even conceivable, that Homer should depart from this"
13155,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,principle in his order of the army? Surely the meaning is this: Having
13156,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"fixed for himself geographically the order of his contingents, he has"
13157,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,likewise to state their order of array upon the field; and accordingly
13158,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"by this line he informs us, that the Phocians, who were the second"
13159,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"of the races he mentions, stood ἐπ’ ἀριστερὰ of the Bœotians: he of"
13160,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"course means us to understand that the Abantes, the third race, were"
13161,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"ἐπ’ ἀριστερὰ of the Locrians, and so on through the whole: or in other"
13162,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"words, that he informs us he does not forget to follow, amidst the"
13163,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"multitudinous detail of the Catalogue, the established, the religious,"
13164,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"and the propitious order of enumeration, namely, the order which begins"
13165,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"from the left, and moves towards the right."
13166,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,
13167,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"Thus we must in this place translate ἐπ’ ἀριστερὰ ‘towards, that is,"
13168,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,looking towards the left of the Bœotians;’ or ‘looking to the Bœotians
13169,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"on their left,’ i. e. of the Phocians; the Phocians being, whichever"
13170,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"construction we adopt, on the right, actually on the right, not the"
13171,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,left of the Bœotians. The real force of the expression probably is
13172,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"this: that the Bœotians, having taken their ground, the Phocians came"
13173,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,up and took theirs next to them on their right.
13174,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,
13175,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,~_Application to Od._ v. 277.~
13176,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,
13177,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,Now this case is precisely in point for Od. v. 277: because θωρήσσεσθαι
13178,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,is not properly a verb of motion: and in all likelihood it may be
13179,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"relied on independently of further details from Homer, because it"
13180,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"brings the matter to an easy test, through the certainty which we may"
13181,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"well entertain, that Homer would have the order of his army begin from"
13182,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"left to right, like every other duly and auspiciously constituted order."
13183,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,
13184,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"There is, however, another interpretation proposed as follows: they,"
13185,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"the Phocians, took ground next (ἔμπλην) to the Bœotians on the left, i."
13186,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"e. of the army; the two together, as it were, forming its left wing. To"
13187,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,this construction there seem to be conclusive objections:
13188,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,
13189,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,1. Why should Homer tell us that the Bœotians and Phocians together
13190,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"constituted a division of the army, when he tells us nothing similar"
13191,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,respecting any of the twenty-six contingents that remain? Neither of
13192,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,these races were particularly distinguished either politically or in
13193,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,arms.
13194,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,
13195,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,2. It appears clear that the Bœotians and Phocians did not together
13196,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"form a division of the army: for, in the Thirteenth Book, the Bœotians"
13197,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"fight in company with the Athenians or Ionians, the Locrians, Phthians,"
13198,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"and Epeans, but not with the Phocians. Il. xiii. 685, 6."
13199,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,
13200,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,3. Neither did the Bœotians belong to the left wing of the army at all:
13201,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,for they are found defending the centre of the ships against Hector
13202,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"and the Trojans, with the two Ajaxes in their front. Il. xiii. 314-16,"
13203,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"674-84, 685, 700; 701, 2; 719, 20."
13204,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,
13205,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"4. There is nowhere the smallest sign, that the Greek army was divided"
13206,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,into wings and centre at all.
13207,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,
13208,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"5. The order of the Catalogue is a geographical order, and not that"
13209,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,of a military arrangement. Therefore it was requisite for Homer to
13210,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,tell us how the troops were arranged in the Review. This he has
13211,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"effected by telling us that the Phocians, the second of his tribes,"
13212,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,drew up on the right of the Bœotians: which we have only to consider
13213,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"tacitly repeated all through, and the order is thus both complete and"
13214,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"propitious. But, according to the other construction, the Poet begins"
13215,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"with an arrangement by wings, of which we hear nowhere else: and then"
13216,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,he forthwith forgets and abandons it.
13217,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,
13218,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,6. I do not think ἐπ’ ἀριστερὰ can be construed to the left of the
13219,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,army. The army has nowhere been named. The phrases ἐπὶ δεξιὰ and ἐπ’
13220,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,ἀριστερὰ require us to have a subject clearly in view. It is frequently
13221,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"named, as in ἐπ’ ἀριστερὰ μάχης. When it is connected with omens, it"
13222,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"means to the west, and ἐπιδέξια the reverse. Again, οἰνοχοεῖν ἐπιδέξια"
13223,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"is to begin pouring wine from the left, and towards the right end of"
13224,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,the rank whom the cupbearer may be serving. The ‘army’ has not been
13225,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,mentioned since the reassembling in v. 207.
13226,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,
13227,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,These objections appear to me fatal to the construction now under our
13228,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,view. They do not indeed touch the question whether ἐπ’ ἀριστερὰ should
13229,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"be interpreted on the left, or (on the right and) towards the left."
13230,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"That must, I think, be decided by the general principles of augury duly"
13231,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,applied to order and enumeration.
13232,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,
13233,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"On the whole, then, I contend that it is wrong to construe Od. v."
13234,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"277, ‘to sail with Arctus _on_ his left hand.’ It would be much more"
13235,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"nearly right, and would, in fact, convey the meaning, though not in"
13236,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"a grammatical manner, if we construed it ‘to sail with Arctus on"
13237,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"his right hand.’ But the manner of construing it, grammatically and"
13238,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"accurately, as I submit, is this: ‘to sail with Arctus looking towards"
13239,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"the left (of his hand, or his left hand);’ that is to say, looking"
13240,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"_from his right_. And generally, that the proper mode of construing ἐπ’"
13241,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"ἀριστερὰ and ἐπὶ δεξιὰ in Homer is, _towards_ the left, _towards_ the"
13242,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"right; or, conversely, _from_ the right, _from_ the left."
13243,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,
13244,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"This meaning is in exact accordance with the North-eastern, and is"
13245,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"entirely opposed to the North-western, hypothesis. And I venture to"
13246,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"believe that, itself established by sufficient evidence from other"
13247,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"passages in the poems, it enables us to give a meaning substantially,"
13248,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"though perhaps not minutely self-consistent, though of course one not"
13249,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,based upon the true configuration of the earth’s surface as it is now

13269,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,But in the later Greek the idea of the point of arrival prevailed over

13271,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"ἐπιδέξια, with its equivalent ἐνδέξια, came to mean simply ‘on the"
13272,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"right,’ and ἐπ’ ἀριστερὰ, ‘on the left.’ It is worth notice, that we"
13273,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,have a like ambiguous use in English of the word _towards_. Sometimes
13274,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,towards the left means being on the left: sometimes it means moving
13275,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,from the right in the direction of the left: and a room ‘towards the
13276,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"south’ means one with its windows on the north, looking out over"
13277,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,"the south, like as the star Arctus looks out towards the left of"

13282,ON THE LINE ODYSS. V. 277.,the force of the epithet is derived from immediate connection with the

13302,SECT. I.,"this work, that for England at least, the main questions as to the"
13303,SECT. I.,Homeric poems have well nigh been settled in the affirmative sense;
13304,SECT. I.,yet I must not pass by without notice the recently propounded theory
13305,SECT. I.,"of Grote. I refer to it, partly on account of the general authority of"
13306,SECT. I.,his work; for this authority may give a currency greater than is really
13307,SECT. I.,"due to a portion of it, which, as lying outside the domain of history"
13308,SECT. I.,"proper, has perhaps been less maturely considered than his conclusions"
13309,SECT. I.,in general. But it is partly also because I do not know that it has yet
13310,SECT. I.,been treated of elsewhere; and most of all because the discussion takes
13311,SECT. I.,"a positive form; for the answer to his argument, which perhaps may be"
13312,SECT. I.,"found to render itself into a gratuitous hypothesis, depends entirely"
13313,SECT. I.,"upon a comprehensive view of the general structure of the poem, and the"
13314,SECT. I.,reciprocal relation and adaptation of its parts.
13315,SECT. I.,
13316,SECT. I.,"Grote believes, that the poem called the Iliad is divisible into two"
13317,SECT. I.,"great portions: one of them he conceives to be an Achilleis, or a poem"
13318,SECT. I.,"having for its subject the wrath of Achilles, which comprises the First"
13319,SECT. I.,"Book, the Eighth, and all from the Eleventh to the Twenty-second Books"
13320,SECT. I.,"inclusive; that the Books from the Second to the Seventh inclusive,"
13321,SECT. I.,"with the Ninth and Tenth, and the two last Books, are portions of what"
13322,SECT. I.,"may be called an Ilias, or general description of the War of Troy,"
13323,SECT. I.,"which have been introduced into the original Achilleis, most probably"
13324,SECT. I.,"by another hand; or, if by the original Poet, yet to the destruction,"
13325,SECT. I.,"or great detriment, of the poetic unity of his work."
13326,SECT. I.,
13327,SECT. I.,"In support of this doctrine he urges,"
13328,SECT. I.,
13329,SECT. I.,1. That the Books from the Second to the Seventh inclusive in no
13330,SECT. I.,"way contribute to the main action, and are ‘brought out in a spirit"

13366,SECT. I.,Grote has argued conclusively against the supposition that we owe the
13367,SECT. I.,"continuous Iliad[687] to the labours of Pisistratus, and shows that it"
13368,SECT. I.,must have been known in its continuity long before. He places the poems
13369,SECT. I.,between 850 and 776 B. C.[688]; admits the splendour of much of the
13370,SECT. I.,poetry which he thus tears from its context[689]; yet he apparently is
13371,SECT. I.,"not startled by the supposition, that the man, or the men, capable of"
13372,SECT. I.,"composing poetry of the superlative kind that makes up his Achilleis,"
13373,SECT. I.,should be so blind to the primary exigencies of such a work for its
13374,SECT. I.,"effect as a whole, that he or they could also be capable of thus"
13375,SECT. I.,"spoiling its unity by adding eight books, which do not belong to the"
13376,SECT. I.,"subject, to fifteen others in which it was already completely handled"
13377,SECT. I.,and disposed of. And though our historian leans to the belief of a
13378,SECT. I.,"plurality of authors for the Iliad, he does not absolutely reject the"
13379,SECT. I.,supposition that it may be the work of one[690].

13401,SECT. I.,"which, by dissevering the prime parts of the poem, produce a"

13404,SECT. I.,"a double authorship, few indeed, I apprehend, will be found, while"

13422,SECT. I.,
13423,SECT. I.,"As respects the Ninth Book, this theory seems to proceed on a"
13424,SECT. I.,misconception of the nature of the offence taken by Achilles; as
13425,SECT. I.,"respects the others, upon a similar misconception of the measure which"
13426,SECT. I.,"the Poet intends us to take of his hero’s greatness, and of the modes"
13427,SECT. I.,by which he means us to arrive at our estimate.
13428,SECT. I.,
13429,SECT. I.,"It takes time to sound the depths of Homer. Possibly, or even probably,"
13430,SECT. I.,many may share the idea that what Achilles resents is the mere loss of
13431,SECT. I.,"a captive woman, and that restitution would at once undo the wrong. But"
13432,SECT. I.,"they misconceive the act, and the man also, to whom the wrong was done."
13433,SECT. I.,"The soul of Achilles is stirred from its depths by an outrage, which"
13434,SECT. I.,seems to him to comprehend all vices within itself. He is wounded in
13435,SECT. I.,an attachment that had become a tender one; for he gives to Briseis the
13436,SECT. I.,"name of wife (ἄλοχον θυμάρεα), and avows his care and protection of her"
13437,SECT. I.,"in that character. A proud and sensitive warrior, he is[693] insulted"
13438,SECT. I.,"in the face of the army; and to the Greeks, whose governing sentiment"
13439,SECT. I.,"was αἴδως, or honour, insult was the deadliest of all inflictions."
13440,SECT. I.,"Further, he is defrauded by the withdrawal of that which, by the public"
13441,SECT. I.,"authority, presiding over the distribution of spoil, he had been taught"
13442,SECT. I.,to call his own; and he keenly feels the combination of deceit with
13443,SECT. I.,"insolence[694]. Justice is outraged in his person, when he alone among"
13444,SECT. I.,the warriors is to have no share of the booty. In this he rightly sees
13445,SECT. I.,"an ingratitude of threefold blackness; it is done by the man, for whose"
13446,SECT. I.,sake[695] he had come to Troy without an interest of his own; it is
13447,SECT. I.,"done to the man, whose hand, almost unaided, had earned the spoil which"
13448,SECT. I.,"the Greeks divided[696]: lastly, it is done to him, on whose valour the"
13449,SECT. I.,fortunes of their host with the hopes of their enterprise principally
13450,SECT. I.,"depended, and whose mere presence on the field of itself drives and"
13451,SECT. I.,"holds aloof the principal champions of Troy[697]. And, lastly, while"
13452,SECT. I.,the whole army is responsible by acquiescence and is so declared by
13453,SECT. I.,"him, (ἐπεί μ’ ἀφέλεσθέ γε δόντες, Il. i. 299,) the insult and wrong"
13454,SECT. I.,"proceed from one, whose avarice and irresolution made him in the eyes"

13473,SECT. I.,"the flame waxes hotter and hotter, and requires more and more to quench"
13474,SECT. I.,it. Thus there is a terrible progression and expansion in his revenge:
13475,SECT. I.,"and by degrees he arrives at a height of fierce vindictiveness, that"
13476,SECT. I.,minutely calculates the modes in which the suffering of its object
13477,SECT. I.,"can be carried to a _maximum_, yet so as to leave his own renown"
13478,SECT. I.,"untouched, and open the widest field for the exercise of his valour."
13479,SECT. I.,"It is not vice, nor is it virtue, which Homer is describing in his"
13480,SECT. I.,Achilles; it is that strange and wayward mixture of regard for right
13481,SECT. I.,"and justice with self-love on the one side, and wrath on the other,"
13482,SECT. I.,"which are so common among us men of meaner scale. The difference is,"
13483,SECT. I.,that in Achilles all the parts of the compound are at once deepened to
13484,SECT. I.,"a superhuman intensity, and raised to a scale of magnificence which"
13485,SECT. I.,"almost transcends our powers of vision. We must, indeed, no more look"
13486,SECT. I.,"for a didactic and pedantic consistency in the movement of his mind,"
13487,SECT. I.,"than in shocks from an earthquake, or bursts of flame from a volcano."
13488,SECT. I.,But a real consistency there is; and doubtless it could be measured by
13489,SECT. I.,"the rules of every day, if only every day produced an Achilles."

13493,SECT. I.,~_Restitution not the object of Achilles._~
13494,SECT. I.,
13495,SECT. I.,"It can hardly fail to draw remark, that the spirit of Achilles never"
13496,SECT. I.,"from the first moment fastens on mere restitution, or on restitution"
13497,SECT. I.,"at all, as its object. With his knowledge of his own might, which was"
13498,SECT. I.,"enough to prompt him, had he not been restrained from heaven, to assail"
13499,SECT. I.,"and slay Agamemnon on the spot, he nevertheless does not so much as"
13500,SECT. I.,entertain the thought of fighting to keep Briseis. His thought is far
13501,SECT. I.,other than this: ‘I will not lift a finger against one of you for the
13502,SECT. I.,"girl, since you choose to take from me what you gave (298, 9). I will"
13503,SECT. I.,"not hold what you think fit to grudge.’ While he adds, that they shall"
13504,SECT. I.,not touch an article of what is properly his own[699]. Not that he
13505,SECT. I.,"cares for mere possession or dispossession. Were that his thought, he"
13506,SECT. I.,would have lifted up the invincible arm for the retention of Briseis.
13507,SECT. I.,"But his thought is this, ‘One outrage you have done to justice and"
13508,SECT. I.,"to me, and, encouraged as well as commanded by great deities, I bear"
13509,SECT. I.,it; but not even under their promises and injunctions will I endure
13510,SECT. I.,that you shall sin again.’ The loss he had suffered now became quite
13511,SECT. I.,"a subordinate image in his mind; punishment of the offenders, and"
13512,SECT. I.,"not restitution, was ever before his view. His first threat is that"
13513,SECT. I.,"of withdrawal (Il. i. 169): which, he conceives, will put a stop to"
13514,SECT. I.,Agamemnon’s rapacious accumulations. Next (233) he swears the mighty
13515,SECT. I.,"oath that every Greek shall rue the day of his wrong, and look in vain"
13516,SECT. I.,"to Agamemnon for protection against the sword of Hector. Again, in his"
13517,SECT. I.,"prayer to Thetis, he intreats that she will induce Jupiter to drive the"
13518,SECT. I.,Greeks in rout and slaughter back upon the ships and the sea. He never
13519,SECT. I.,dreams of the mere reparation of his wrong: when he refers to Briseis
13520,SECT. I.,"in the great oration of the Ninth Book, it is for the purpose of a"
13521,SECT. I.,slaying sarcasm against the Atreidæ; his soul utterly refuses to treat
13522,SECT. I.,the affair in the manner of an action at law for damages; he looks for
13523,SECT. I.,nothing less than the prostration of the Grecian host and its being
13524,SECT. I.,"brought to the very door of utter and final ruin, with the compound"
13525,SECT. I.,"view of avenging wrong, glorifying justice, enhancing the sufferings"
13526,SECT. I.,"of his foe, and magnifying the occasion and achievements of his own"
13527,SECT. I.,"might, to be put forth when the proper time shall come."
13528,SECT. I.,
13529,SECT. I.,"[699] The ἄλλα, v. 300, must mean what he had not acquired by gift of"
13530,SECT. I.,"the army; since in Il. 9. 335, as well as in i. 167, 356, he apparently"

13538,SECT. I.,active encouragement to the Trojan chiefs and army in the fight. They
13539,SECT. I.,"are discerned by the Greeks, who accordingly recede[700]. Finding"
13540,SECT. I.,"that, instead of driving the Trojans to the city, on the contrary,"
13541,SECT. I.,"even before the single fight of Hector and Ajax, they themselves had"
13542,SECT. I.,"suffered loss, they supply their camp with the defences, which it"
13543,SECT. I.,had never needed while the name of Achilles and his prowess kept the
13544,SECT. I.,"enemy either within their walls, or in the immediate vicinity of the"
13545,SECT. I.,"city. This happens in the Seventh Book, and it is the first note of"
13546,SECT. I.,"the consequences of the Wrath. In the Eighth, they are more decidedly"
13547,SECT. I.,"worsted under a divine influence, and are driven back upon their"
13548,SECT. I.,"works, while the Trojans bivouac on the place of battle. The army had"
13549,SECT. I.,suffered no heavy loss: yet the infirm will of Agamemnon gives way:
13550,SECT. I.,"and, portending greater evils, he a second time counsels flight[701]."
13551,SECT. I.,The advice is warmly repudiated by Diomed and the other chiefs. Still
13552,SECT. I.,the course of their affairs is now by undeniable signs altered for the
13553,SECT. I.,"worse. Hereupon, Nestor advises an attempt to conciliate Achilles by"
13554,SECT. I.,"offers of restitution and of gifts, with close union and incorporation"
13555,SECT. I.,into the family of Agamemnon. Now it is most important that we should
13556,SECT. I.,"observe, that gifts and kind words were the beginning and the end"
13557,SECT. I.,of this mission. There was no confession of wrong authorized by
13558,SECT. I.,"Agamemnon, or made by the Envoys, to Achilles. The woes of the Greeks"
13559,SECT. I.,are described: Achilles is exhorted to lay aside his Wrath: he is

13561,SECT. I.,not one word in the speech of Ulysses conveys the admission at length
13562,SECT. I.,"gained from Agamemnon in the Nineteenth Book, that he has offended."

13575,SECT. I.,"exasperation. The very offer of them thus made seemed, and in some"
13576,SECT. I.,"degree rightly seemed, to imply that they who tendered it must take him"
13577,SECT. I.,"for a man, whose mind was cast in the same sordid mould as that of the"
13578,SECT. I.,"king, who had given the offence. Gifts indeed Achilles must have, and"
13579,SECT. I.,"abundance of them, when he is at last to be appeased: but it is not in"
13580,SECT. I.,order to swell an inventory of possessions: it is that the memory of
13581,SECT. I.,"them may dwell in his mind, and stand upon the record of his life, like"
13582,SECT. I.,"the golden ornaments that he wore upon his manly person, namely, to"
13583,SECT. I.,exhibit and to make felt his glory.
13584,SECT. I.,
13585,SECT. I.,I do not indeed presume to say we have evidence to show that Achilles
13586,SECT. I.,"would have relented at the period of the mission, if a frank confession"
13587,SECT. I.,"of wrong, and apology for insult, had been made together with the"
13588,SECT. I.,"proffer of the gifts. On the contrary, with his higher sentiments there"
13589,SECT. I.,mingled a towering passion of a vindictive order. It was as it were
13590,SECT. I.,"the corruption or abuse, not the basis, of the mood of the estranged"
13591,SECT. I.,"Achilles: but it was there, and there, like everything Achillean,"
13592,SECT. I.,in colossal proportions. Still I think it has not been sufficiently
13593,SECT. I.,"observed that, as matter of fact, the proceeding of the Ninth Book was"
13594,SECT. I.,"radically defective, because it treated the affair as (so to call"
13595,SECT. I.,"it) one of mere merchandize, to be disposed of like the balance of an"
13596,SECT. I.,account.
13597,SECT. I.,
13598,SECT. I.,When Achilles finds that the desire to avenge the death of Patroclus
13599,SECT. I.,"has become paramount within him, and in consequence renounces the"
13600,SECT. I.,"Wrath[702], it is true that he does not stipulate for an apology. But"
13601,SECT. I.,"neither does he stipulate for the gifts. Both however are given, and"
13602,SECT. I.,"the apology comes first in the faltering speech of Agamemnon[703], who"
13603,SECT. I.,distinguishes between two kinds of atonement;

13611,SECT. I.,"Were there any doubt about the reality of this distinction, it might"
13612,SECT. I.,"be removed by evidence which the Odyssey supplies. Eurualus, who"
13613,SECT. I.,"appears to have been one of the secondary kings in Scheria, had not yet"
13614,SECT. I.,"atoned for his insult to Ulysses, when Alcinous recommended that all"
13615,SECT. I.,"the twelve, who belonged to that order, should make a present to the"
13616,SECT. I.,"departing stranger. But from Eurualus, he observes, something more is"
13617,SECT. I.,requisite; he must offer an apology as well as a gift[704];

13629,SECT. I.,"It was not a moment’s light apprehension, suffered by Agamemnon and the"
13630,SECT. I.,"army, that could avail to obliterate his resentment. They had scarcely"
13631,SECT. I.,tasted of the cup of bitterness; he required that they should drain it
13632,SECT. I.,to the dregs. He will not hear of the return of Briseis: τῇ παριαύων
13633,SECT. I.,"τερπέσθω[705]. With a mixture of close argument, terrible denunciation,"
13634,SECT. I.,"and withering sarcasm, he overpowers and silences the Envoys. Only"

13638,SECT. I.,
13639,SECT. I.,Yet the mighty spirit of Achilles sways to and fro in the tempest of
13640,SECT. I.,"its own emotions. Again he has threatened to depart: bidding them, with"
13641,SECT. I.,"a bitterness that mounts far away into the region of the sublime, come"
13642,SECT. I.,"the next day and see, if they think such a sight can be worth their"
13643,SECT. I.,"seeing, his fleet speeding homeward across the broad Hellespont; or"
13644,SECT. I.,north Ægean. But this course of action would have balked his appetite
13645,SECT. I.,"for glory; which, as he knew[706], he could only buy, and that with"
13646,SECT. I.,"his life, at Troy. Perhaps, too, he was softened by the respect of the"
13647,SECT. I.,"Envoys, who were personally agreeable to him; perhaps grimly pleased"
13648,SECT. I.,with the awe that his Titanic passion had inspired; perhaps affected
13649,SECT. I.,with a sympathetic feeling of regard by the straightforward bluntness
13650,SECT. I.,of Ajax. At any rate it is plain that there followed upon the speech
13651,SECT. I.,"of the Telamoniad chief[707] a greater sign of yielding, than any"
13652,SECT. I.,"which the paternal exhortations of Phœnix, or those most artfully"
13653,SECT. I.,"drawn pictures by Ulysses[708] of the rage and fury of Hector, had"
13654,SECT. I.,"sufficed to produce. In answer to Ulysses, to the bottom of whose"
13655,SECT. I.,"astuteness his clear eye had pierced, he says, ‘I shall go[709].’ In"
13656,SECT. I.,"answer to Phœnix[710], ‘To-morrow we will decide, whether to go or"
13657,SECT. I.,"stay.’ In answer to Ajax, he makes a more sensible advance. He now so"
13658,SECT. I.,"far relents as to tell them, he will bethink himself of battle; yet it"
13659,SECT. I.,"shall only be when the hand of Hector, dealing death to Greeks, and"

13661,SECT. I.,"Myrmidons. Then it will be time enough: for then, at _his_ encampment"

13679,SECT. I.,"Thus far, then, we surely have no pretext for saying that Homer has"
13680,SECT. I.,"departed from the purpose of his poem, of which the man Achilles is the"
13681,SECT. I.,"centre and animating principle, and his Wrath with its terrible effects"
13682,SECT. I.,the theme. These effects are now developed up to a certain point: not
13683,SECT. I.,"such a point as really to endanger the army, or excite strong sympathy"
13684,SECT. I.,"or apprehension on its behalf, but yet such a point as entirely to tame"
13685,SECT. I.,"the irresolute egotism of Agamemnon, and drive his but half-masculine"
13686,SECT. I.,"character into efforts again to lay hold upon the prop, which he had so"
13687,SECT. I.,"rashly and lightly, as well as selfishly and unjustly, put away."
13688,SECT. I.,
13689,SECT. I.,"If we were to consider Achilles as engaged in a mere personal quarrel,"
13690,SECT. I.,"we must condemn him, without any qualification whatever, for not"
13691,SECT. I.,accepting the reparation now tendered by Agamemnon. But if we bear in
13692,SECT. I.,"mind that the wrong done was a public wrong, that no confession of this"
13693,SECT. I.,"wrong was made, that the other kings and leaders, and the whole army,"
13694,SECT. I.,"became in some degree parties to it by their acquiescence, and that he"
13695,SECT. I.,was thus as much or more the vindicator of great public rights than
13696,SECT. I.,"the mere avenger of a personal offence, it is not so clear that the"
13697,SECT. I.,conduct of Achilles after the mission of the Ninth Book is incapable
13698,SECT. I.,"in principle of justification, according to the moral code of Greece."
13699,SECT. I.,"It must, however, undoubtedly remain amenable to severe censure on the"
13700,SECT. I.,"score of excess: a culpability, for the penal notice of which Homer has"
13701,SECT. I.,made abundant provision in the sequel of the poem.
13702,SECT. I.,
13703,SECT. I.,But this question is by the way: the main issue raised is as to the
13704,SECT. I.,"poetical consistency and effect of the structure, which Homer has"
13705,SECT. I.,chosen for his work. Upon this there is surely little room for doubt.
13706,SECT. I.,
13707,SECT. I.,From the Ninth Book we commence afresh: Achilles in his moody
13708,SECT. I.,"seclusion, the Greeks in a manful determination to do their best; even"
13709,SECT. I.,"Agamemnon is now roused to feel what he has brought upon the army,"
13710,SECT. I.,thrown back from his moral irresolution as a chief upon his personal
13711,SECT. I.,"courage as a soldier, and resolved to appear in the field, that he too"
13712,SECT. I.,may earn his laurels there.
13713,SECT. I.,
13714,SECT. I.,And these intentions are gallantly fulfilled. The night foray of Diomed
13715,SECT. I.,"and Ulysses stands well, as one of the minor but safe measures, by"
13716,SECT. I.,which a skilful generalship often makes its first efforts to raise the
13717,SECT. I.,"spirits of a downcast army. Agamemnon then appears, and shows himself"
13718,SECT. I.,"to be a warrior of a high, nay of the highest order of strength and"
13719,SECT. I.,valour. The other kings exert themselves with their wonted chivalry.
13720,SECT. I.,"But the decree of Jove, working through the accidents of war, drives"
13721,SECT. I.,"three of the four great champions from the field, and leaves only"
13722,SECT. I.,"Ajax; who, invincible wherever he is found, yet cannot be everywhere,"
13723,SECT. I.,"nor, single handed, govern the result of battle along the whole extent"
13724,SECT. I.,of the line. And now come the great exertions and successes of the
13725,SECT. I.,"Trojans, especially Sarpedon and his Lycian contingent, Hector playing"
13726,SECT. I.,rather a conventional than a real part. Now it goes hard indeed with
13727,SECT. I.,the Greeks; the fire touches the ships; Patroclus must go forth and
13728,SECT. I.,"die; and the Wrath is at an end, for it is drowned in the bitterness of"
13729,SECT. I.,the tears of Achilles.
13730,SECT. I.,
13731,SECT. I.,"With reference, then, to the main purpose of the poem, it proceeds"
13732,SECT. I.,"regularly to its climax, and there is no limb of the Iliad separable"
13733,SECT. I.,"from the body without destroying the symmetrical, masculine, and broad"
13734,SECT. I.,development of its general plan. I speak now of the principal fabric
13735,SECT. I.,"of the poem. Few who are not prepared to pull that in pieces will, I"
13736,SECT. I.,"apprehend, accede to the proposal to shear it of the two last Books,"
13737,SECT. I.,which therefore hardly require a separate defence.
13738,SECT. I.,
13739,SECT. I.,~_Skilful adjustment of conflicting aims._~
13740,SECT. I.,
13741,SECT. I.,"To me it appears well worthy of remark, with what extraordinary skill"
13742,SECT. I.,Homer has contrived to adjust his poem to the several aims which he had
13743,SECT. I.,to keep in view. The grand one doubtless was the glory of his country
13744,SECT. I.,in the person of Achilles[712]. Still he was bound not to sacrifice
13745,SECT. I.,poetically the martial fame of the rest of Greece even to the first
13746,SECT. I.,"among them, whatever calamities he might make the army suffer on his"
13747,SECT. I.,"account. To avoid this sacrifice, he was obliged to uphold the military"
13748,SECT. I.,"character and power of the Greeks in their struggle with the Trojans,"
13749,SECT. I.,even when deprived of the prowess of their great champion Achilles.
13750,SECT. I.,"And yet he could not degrade Hector and the Trojans, or he would have"
13751,SECT. I.,reached the lame conclusion of adorning his own country’s heroes with
13752,SECT. I.,a poor and unworthy triumph. Thus his course was to be steered among a
13753,SECT. I.,"variety of difficulties, all pressing upon him from opposite quarters."
13754,SECT. I.,
13755,SECT. I.,"[712] On the character of Achilles, I recommend reference to Colonel"
13756,SECT. I.,"Mure, Lit. Greece, i. 273-91, and 304-14. In no part of his treatment"
13757,SECT. I.,of the poems has that excellent Homerist (if I may presume to say so)
13758,SECT. I.,"done better service. See likewise Professor Wilson’s Essays, Critique"
13759,SECT. I.,"iv: and the Prælections of the Rev. J. Keble, i. 90-104. This refined"
13760,SECT. I.,"work, which criticizes the poems in the spirit of a Bard, set an early"
13761,SECT. I.,"example, at least to England, of elevating the tone of Homeric study."
13762,SECT. I.,
13763,SECT. I.,We see at once how steadily he kept in view his pole-star; how he
13764,SECT. I.,handled the events and characters of his poem so as to give the most
13765,SECT. I.,"powerful, or rather it may be said the most overpowering, impression"
13766,SECT. I.,"of the greatness of his hero, which is lifted higher and higher by"
13767,SECT. I.,the whole movement of the work as it proceeds. Let us now examine
13768,SECT. I.,"whether, in giving full scope to his main purpose, he has been obliged"
13769,SECT. I.,"to sacrifice others which were also important, nay, if the highest"
13770,SECT. I.,"excellence was his aim, even indispensable."
13771,SECT. I.,
13772,SECT. I.,"The paramount glory of Achilles is established by this: first, that in"
13773,SECT. I.,"the Ninth Book the whole army, as it were, lies at his feet, and is"
13774,SECT. I.,"spurned from thence: secondly, that when he finally comes forth, it"
13775,SECT. I.,"is not in deference to those who have insulted him, but it is under"
13776,SECT. I.,the burning impulses of his own heart. Let us now proceed to inquire
13777,SECT. I.,whether the Poet has or has not satisfied two other great demands. Has
13778,SECT. I.,"he, as a Greek, done all that was required to glorify Greece, and is"
13779,SECT. I.,"Achilles its crown only, or is he its substitute? Has he, as a man,"
13780,SECT. I.,"vindicated the principles of the moral order, and of that retributive"
13781,SECT. I.,"justice which, even in this world, visibly maintains at least a partial"
13782,SECT. I.,balance between human action and its consequences to the agent?
13783,SECT. I.,
13784,SECT. I.,~_Glory given to Greece._~
13785,SECT. I.,
13786,SECT. I.,"We should look in vain, I think, for a finer and subtler exercise of"
13787,SECT. I.,"poetic art, than in the mode in which Homer has contrived to convey to"
13788,SECT. I.,"us, both the general, and in particular the military inferiority of"
13789,SECT. I.,"the Trojans, as compared with the Greeks. Hardly any reader can be so"
13790,SECT. I.,"superficial in his observation of the poem, as not to rise from it with"
13791,SECT. I.,this inferiority sufficiently impressed upon his mind. Yet there is
13792,SECT. I.,"not a passage or a word throughout, in which it is asserted. And why?"
13793,SECT. I.,Because every direct assertion that the Trojans were less valiant or
13794,SECT. I.,"less strong than their antagonists, would have been so much detracted"
13795,SECT. I.,from the glory of overcoming them. It was essential to the work of the
13796,SECT. I.,"Poet, that he should represent the contest as an arduous one. He might"
13797,SECT. I.,"have done this in the coarse method, for which his theurgy would have"
13798,SECT. I.,"afforded the materials: that is, by converting his Trojans into mere"
13799,SECT. I.,"puppets, whose arm, at every turn of the narrative, merely represented"
13800,SECT. I.,"the impelling force of some deity or other, and, independently of"
13801,SECT. I.,"such extraneous aid, was powerless. But this would have destroyed the"
13802,SECT. I.,full-flushed humanity of Homer’s poem.
13803,SECT. I.,
13804,SECT. I.,"As it is, he has availed himself of the divine element to make up by"
13805,SECT. I.,its assistance for the comparative weakness of the Trojan chiefs: but
13806,SECT. I.,"it is only a subdued and occasional assistance, so that there is no"
13807,SECT. I.,glaring difference in point of free agency between the two parties. Nor
13808,SECT. I.,"can it be without a purpose, that the two deities, who appear in the"
13809,SECT. I.,"field on behalf of the Trojans, namely, Venus and Mars, are sent off it"
13810,SECT. I.,"both wounded, the one whining, and the other howling, by the prowess"
13811,SECT. I.,"of Diomed. If the Greeks are to suffer by the gods, he takes care that"
13812,SECT. I.,it shall not be by those gods who are the mere national partisans of
13813,SECT. I.,"Troy, but by a higher agency; by the decree of Jupiter, now temporarily"
13814,SECT. I.,"indeed, but effectively, set against them."
13815,SECT. I.,
13816,SECT. I.,It is by an indefinitely great number of strokes and touches each
13817,SECT. I.,"indefinitely small, that Homer has gained his object. The Trojan"
13818,SECT. I.,successes are always effected with the concurrence of supernatural
13819,SECT. I.,"power; the Greeks not unfrequently without, and sometimes even against"
13820,SECT. I.,it[713].

13822,SECT. I.,[713] Il. xvi. 780.
13823,SECT. I.,
13824,SECT. I.,"He as it were sets up the Trojans, so to speak, by generalities; but"
13825,SECT. I.,"he gives to the Greeks, with certain occasional exceptions, the whole"
13826,SECT. I.,detail of solid achievement. Sometimes he allows a panic of doubt and
13827,SECT. I.,"fear to seize their host, but he takes care to make the sentiment only"
13828,SECT. I.,"flit like a momentary shade over the sun. Thus, when the assembled"
13829,SECT. I.,chieftains of the Greek army hesitate to accept the challenge of
13830,SECT. I.,"Hector[714],"
13831,SECT. I.,

13836,SECT. I.,"But after a short interval, and a proper appeal, nine champions appear,"
13837,SECT. I.,each and all burning to meet Hector in single combat. Sometimes he
13838,SECT. I.,"contrives to direct his praises to martial appearance and exterior,"
13839,SECT. I.,but carefully avoids the real touches of heroic character; as when
13840,SECT. I.,he bestows on Paris the noble simile of the στάτος ἵππος. Generally
13841,SECT. I.,"he pays off, as it were, the Trojans with high-sounding words, and"
13842,SECT. I.,"reserves nearly all the true qualities of heroes, as well as their"
13843,SECT. I.,"exploits, for the Achæans. With them are the sagacity, consistency,"
13844,SECT. I.,"firmness, promptitude, enterprise, power of adapting means to ends,"
13845,SECT. I.,"comprehensiveness of view, as well as main strength of hand. But by"
13846,SECT. I.,"the expedients I have mentioned, the Trojans are raised to, and kept"
13847,SECT. I.,"at and no more than at, the level necessary to make them worthy and"
13848,SECT. I.,creditable antagonists. One other engine for the purpose has been
13849,SECT. I.,"employed by him, namely, the real valour and manhood of the Lycian"
13850,SECT. I.,"kings and forces[715], with whom he had evidently a strong and peculiar"
13851,SECT. I.,"sympathy; whose chief, Sarpedon, is really a better man in war than"
13852,SECT. I.,"Hector, though much less pretentious; and who, under this prince,"
13853,SECT. I.,"achieve the only real, great, and independent success that is to be"
13854,SECT. I.,"found on that side throughout the whole course of the poems, namely,"
13855,SECT. I.,the first forcing of the Greek entrenchments[716].
13856,SECT. I.,
13857,SECT. I.,"[715] Since the first portion of this work went to press, I have found"
13858,SECT. I.,"from the recent and still unfinished work of Welcher, _Griechische"
13859,SECT. I.,"Götterlehre_, i. 2. n., that philological evidence appears to have been"
13860,SECT. I.,recently obtained of a close relationship between the Lycians and the
13861,SECT. I.,Greeks.

13863,SECT. I.,[716] Il. xii. 397-9.
13864,SECT. I.,
13865,SECT. I.,The Trojan inferiority indeed lies very much more palpably in the
13866,SECT. I.,"chiefs, than in the common soldiers. Between the bulk of the army on"
13867,SECT. I.,"the one side and on the other, Homer represents no great--at least no"
13868,SECT. I.,glaring difference. Sometimes the fight is carried on upon terms purely
13869,SECT. I.,"equal[717], as during the forenoon of the day in the Eleventh Book:"
13870,SECT. I.,"where there is superiority, it is assigned to the Greeks[718] or to"
13871,SECT. I.,"the Trojans[719], according as the exigencies of the poem may require."
13872,SECT. I.,Still he contrives some note of difference so as to draw a line between
13873,SECT. I.,"the merit of the respective successes; thus, when the Trojans turn the"
13874,SECT. I.,"Greeks to flight, there is commonly an intimation, in more or less"
13875,SECT. I.,"general terms, of a divine agency stimulating them. Hostile weapons"
13876,SECT. I.,are indeed often turned aside on behalf of Greeks: but only in one
13877,SECT. I.,"instance, I think, do the Greeks derive decided advantage from a panic"
13878,SECT. I.,"divinely inspired: it is when, in the Sixteenth Book, Jupiter instils"
13879,SECT. I.,into Hector the spirit of fear[720].

13889,SECT. I.,This absence of broad contrast between the two soldieries is in entire
13890,SECT. I.,accordance with what we have seen reason to presume as to their
13891,SECT. I.,"composition; namely, that the rank and file on both sides was in all"
13892,SECT. I.,likelihood composed from kindred and Pelasgian races.
13893,SECT. I.,
13894,SECT. I.,Yet a strong jealousy on behalf of his country is ever the predominant
13895,SECT. I.,"sentiment in the Poet’s mind; and accordingly he insinuates, with"
13896,SECT. I.,"much art, suggestions which keep even the Trojan soldiery somewhat"
13897,SECT. I.,"below the Greeks; while to the chieftains of the Greek army, though"
13898,SECT. I.,his laudatory epithets are nearly as high on the one side as on the
13899,SECT. I.,"other, he assigns in action an enormous superiority, both military"
13900,SECT. I.,"and intellectual. Accordingly, when we come to cast up the results"
13901,SECT. I.,"of the actual encounters, we are astounded at the littleness, the"
13902,SECT. I.,"almost nothingness, of the Trojan achievements, and at the large havock"
13903,SECT. I.,"wrought by their opponents, even during the period when Achilles was in"
13904,SECT. I.,estrangement[721].
13905,SECT. I.,
13906,SECT. I.,[721] This would be best shown by a list of the considerable personages
13907,SECT. I.,slain on the two sides respectively.
13908,SECT. I.,
13909,SECT. I.,"As regards the armies at large, observe the similes used in the Fourth"
13910,SECT. I.,"Book[722]. The Greeks move in silence and discipline, like the swelling"
13911,SECT. I.,"waves when the tempest is just beginning to gather: the Trojans, like"
13912,SECT. I.,"innumerable sheep, who stand bleating in the fold while they are being"
13913,SECT. I.,"milked[723]. In the Fifth Book, while it is mentioned, as if casually,"
13914,SECT. I.,"that Apollo, Mars, and Eris, were stirring and keeping up the Trojans,"
13915,SECT. I.,"it is subjoined, without ostensible reference to this intimation, but"
13916,SECT. I.,"plainly in artful contrast with it, that the Greeks found sufficient"
13917,SECT. I.,"incentives in the exhortations of the two Ajaxes, of Ulysses, and"
13918,SECT. I.,"of Diomed[724]. Again, when Hector returns, after his battle with"
13919,SECT. I.,"Ajax[725], to his comrades, we are told that they rejoiced in finding"
13920,SECT. I.,"him restored to them in safety, contrary to their expectation,"
13921,SECT. I.,"ἀέλπτοντες σόον εἶναι. On the other hand, it is added, the Greeks led"
13922,SECT. I.,"Ajax to Agamemnon, exulting in his victory over Hector (κεχαρηότα"
13923,SECT. I.,"νίκῃ). The Greeks feel no thankfulness, because they had, we are"
13924,SECT. I.,"evidently to understand, felt no fear. And the chief rejoices in his"
13925,SECT. I.,"victory, which it really was. It was, indeed, ended as a drawn battle,"
13926,SECT. I.,though Ajax had had the best of it at every stage; but not so much for
13927,SECT. I.,"the honour of Hector, as for the purposes of the poem, since Hector"
13928,SECT. I.,"had to meet Achilles in the field, and he would have been degraded by"
13929,SECT. I.,encountering an antagonist that anybody else had palpably worsted. To
13930,SECT. I.,"state the paradox as Homer had to confront it, the problem was to make"
13931,SECT. I.,"Ajax conqueror, without letting Hector be conquered."

13942,SECT. I.,
13943,SECT. I.,"When we look to the case of the chieftains as a whole, the contrast is"
13944,SECT. I.,"glaring. No first rate, or even second rate, Greek chieftain is ever"
13945,SECT. I.,"killed in fair field: Tlepolemus, slain by Sarpedon, comes the nearest"
13946,SECT. I.,"to that rank, but is not in it. Patroclus is only slain after being"
13947,SECT. I.,disarmed by Apollo: and here it seems to me as if for once the Poet had
13948,SECT. I.,"a little overshot his mark; for the artifice is gross, and covers the"
13949,SECT. I.,"pretended exploit of Hector with indelible disgrace. In fact, Hector"
13950,SECT. I.,never once achieves a considerable success in the field: though only
13951,SECT. I.,"Achilles, the first Greek warrior, is allowed completely to overcome"
13952,SECT. I.,"him[726], yet he is decidedly inferior in fight to both Diomed and"
13953,SECT. I.,"Ajax, who jointly occupy the two next places, but as between whom Homer"
13954,SECT. I.,"has not decisively marked the claim to precedence. In general terms,"
13955,SECT. I.,"he gives it to Ajax more emphatically[727], but he details more and"
13956,SECT. I.,greater acts of prowess in favour of Diomed.

13965,SECT. I.,and Polydamas are the most considerable who survive. No eminent
13966,SECT. I.,"Trojan in fact is ever allowed to display real heroism, except under"
13967,SECT. I.,circumstances where the issue is quite hopeless: accordingly Homer has
13968,SECT. I.,"never surrounded Hector with true heroic grandeur, in deed as well"
13969,SECT. I.,"as word, until his final battle against Achilles, when he is at last"
13970,SECT. I.,"brought to bay, and when his doom is certain. All the considerable"
13971,SECT. I.,injuries inflicted upon great Greek chieftains are from causes not
13972,SECT. I.,implying personal prowess in their rivals: from the arrows of Pandarus
13973,SECT. I.,"or of Paris, or by the chance hit of some insignificant, or at the"
13974,SECT. I.,"least secondary, but desperate Trojan, such as Socus, or such as Coon,"
13975,SECT. I.,struck even as he is himself receiving or about to receive his own
13976,SECT. I.,"death-blow[728]. But for these ignoble wounds, which were inflicted"
13977,SECT. I.,"on many chiefs, including three prime heroes, Agamemnon, Diomed, and"
13978,SECT. I.,"Ulysses, the Greeks, according to the agency of the poem as it stands,"

13984,SECT. I.,
13985,SECT. I.,Now Homer’s difficulty in this matter was not simply that which has
13986,SECT. I.,"been heretofore pointed out, or which has been commonly supposed. His"
13987,SECT. I.,"aim, says Heyne[729], in representing the disasters of the Greeks is,"
13988,SECT. I.,"_ut per eas Achillis virtus insigniatur, quippe quâ destituti Achivi"
13989,SECT. I.,"succumbunt, eâdem redditâ vincunt_. But this is surely a misstatement"
13990,SECT. I.,of the case. Homer has not represented the Greeks _plus_ Achilles as
13991,SECT. I.,"superior to the Trojans, and the Greeks _minus_ Achilles as inferior"
13992,SECT. I.,"to them. This was what a vulgar artist, whose mind could only hold"
13993,SECT. I.,"one idea at a time, would have done; nay, what it was difficult to"
13994,SECT. I.,"avoid doing, for it was vital to Homer’s purpose that the vengeance of"
13995,SECT. I.,Achilles should be completely satiated: it was not to be thought of
13996,SECT. I.,"that this transcendent character, this ideal hero, should be balked by"
13997,SECT. I.,man of woman born; the whole web of the Poet’s thought would have been
13998,SECT. I.,"rent across, had there been failure in such a point. What was needful"
13999,SECT. I.,in this view could only be accomplished by the extremest calamities of
14000,SECT. I.,"the Greeks. These calamities he had to bring about, and yet to give to"
14001,SECT. I.,the Greeks a real superiority of military virtue. We have seen already
14002,SECT. I.,how he effected the latter: how did he manage the former? Partly by
14003,SECT. I.,"giving Achilles, in right of his mother Thetis, such an interest in"
14004,SECT. I.,"the courts of heaven, as to throw a preponderating divine agency for"
14005,SECT. I.,the time on the side of the Trojans; partly by a skilful use of the
14006,SECT. I.,"chances of war, in assigning to Troy a superiority in the comparatively"
14007,SECT. I.,ignoble skill (as it was then used) of the bow. Thus he causes the
14008,SECT. I.,"Greeks to be worsted, notwithstanding their superiority: by their being"
14009,SECT. I.,"worsted, he satisfies the exigencies of his plot; by exhibiting their"
14010,SECT. I.,"superiority, he fulfils the conditions of his own office as a national"
14011,SECT. I.,"poet. To speak of the ingenuity of Homer may sound strange, for we are"
14012,SECT. I.,accustomed to associate his name with ideas of greater nobleness; but
14013,SECT. I.,"still his ingenuity, in this adjustment of conflicting demands upon"
14014,SECT. I.,"him, appears to be such as has never been surpassed."

14019,SECT. I.,~_Greeks superior even without Achilles._~
14020,SECT. I.,
14021,SECT. I.,"And here I, for one, cannot but admire the way in which Homer has"
14022,SECT. I.,"made purposes, which others would have found conflicting, to serve"
14023,SECT. I.,as reciprocal auxiliaries. The Embassy of the Ninth Book certainly
14024,SECT. I.,"glorifies Achilles: but let us ask, does it not help also to glorify"
14025,SECT. I.,Greece? Let us consider what had happened. The withdrawal of Achilles
14026,SECT. I.,was at once felt as a great blow; and it acted on the whole tone of
14027,SECT. I.,the army. This appears in various ways. We read it in the home-sick
14028,SECT. I.,impulses of the Second Assembly (b. ii.); in the advice of Nestor to
14029,SECT. I.,take measures for securing the responsibility of officers and men
14030,SECT. I.,(ii. 360-8); in the slackness of various chiefs during the Circuit
14031,SECT. I.,of Agamemnon (b. iv.); in its being recorded to the honour of that
14032,SECT. I.,"leader (iv. 223) that he did not flinch from his duty; lastly, in the"
14033,SECT. I.,momentary reluctance of the Greek heroes to encounter Hector (vii.
14034,SECT. I.,"93). All this is thoroughly natural. Having leant upon a prop, they"
14035,SECT. I.,"were not at once aware of their remaining and intrinsic strength. They,"
14036,SECT. I.,"like all persons who have not learned the habit of self-reliance,"
14037,SECT. I.,"required to learn it with pain. Hence, after the very first touch"
14038,SECT. I.,"of comparative weakness in the field, they conceive the idea of the"
14039,SECT. I.,rampart. They had not really been worsted: but their enemies had
14040,SECT. I.,learned to face them; their position was now no longer what it had used
14041,SECT. I.,"to be, when Hector did not venture out in front of the Dardanian Gate."
14042,SECT. I.,"But the building of the rampart produced, as was natural, an increased"
14043,SECT. I.,"weakness. Besides this, Jupiter, seeing that the tendency of events"
14044,SECT. I.,"was not to give a sufficiently rapid and decisive triumph to Achilles,"
14045,SECT. I.,"now inhibited those deities, who were friendly to Greece, from taking"
14046,SECT. I.,"part, while he himself (viii. 75) alarmed and abashed the Greeks"
14047,SECT. I.,with his thunder. They thus feel themselves thrown one full stage
14048,SECT. I.,"further into weakness. What more natural, than that they should turn"
14049,SECT. I.,"to Achilles, and try his disposition towards them? This is effected"
14050,SECT. I.,"in the Ninth Book. They then become acquainted practically, for the"
14051,SECT. I.,"first time, with the fierceness of the seven times heated furnace of"
14052,SECT. I.,"the Wrath. This experience teaches them, that they must do or die. So"
14053,SECT. I.,"at last, the bridge behind them being broken, Greece is put upon her"
14054,SECT. I.,mettle. The gallant Diomed becomes the spokesman at once of chivalry
14055,SECT. I.,"and of common sense. ‘You should not have asked him. By asking, you"
14056,SECT. I.,have emboldened and hardened him. Let him alone. Rely upon yourselves.
14057,SECT. I.,"Refresh yourselves with sleep and a good meal, and then, order out the"
14058,SECT. I.,"troops, and have at them: I for my part will be found in the van[730].’"
14059,SECT. I.,"Then it is that the Greeks understand their position, and, casting"
14060,SECT. I.,"off hope from Achilles, place it in themselves. Hence that great"
14061,SECT. I.,"development of valorous energies in the Eleventh Book, which proves"
14062,SECT. I.,"that in equal fight, even though Achilles were absent, Troy had not a"
14063,SECT. I.,"hope: so that the expedient of chance-wounds, disabling all the prime"
14064,SECT. I.,"warriors but Ajax, is absolutely necessary in order to bring about the"
14065,SECT. I.,"required amount of disaster. It appears to me, I confess, that this is"
14066,SECT. I.,"a masterly adjustment, alike true in nature, and high in art."

14071,SECT. I.,"tentative effort, of the Doloneia."
14072,SECT. I.,
14073,SECT. I.,Next to the skill and power with which the Poet has discriminated the
14074,SECT. I.,"characters of his greater Greek heroes, I am tempted to admire the"
14075,SECT. I.,"circumspection and precision, with which he has assigned their relative"
14076,SECT. I.,degrees of prominence in the action. To those who complain of the
14077,SECT. I.,"Doloneia for want of a purpose, I would reply that, in the first place,"
14078,SECT. I.,besides its merits as an operation with reference to the circumstances
14079,SECT. I.,"of the moment, (for it feeds the army, as it were, with milk, when they"
14080,SECT. I.,"were not yet ready for strong meat,) it remarkably varies the tenour of"
14081,SECT. I.,"the action, which without it would have fallen into something of sleepy"
14082,SECT. I.,"sameness, by substituting stratagem for force, and night-adventure for"
14083,SECT. I.,the conflicts of the day. Let those who doubt this strike out the Tenth
14084,SECT. I.,"Book, and then consider how the course of the military transactions of"
14085,SECT. I.,the poem would stand without it: how much more justly the first moiety
14086,SECT. I.,of the military action of the poem would stand liable to the imputation
14087,SECT. I.,"of monotony, which even now is of necessity the besetting danger of"
14088,SECT. I.,"the whole poem. But more; I contend that the Doloneia constitutes,"
14089,SECT. I.,"in the main, the ἀριστεῖα of Ulysses. His distinguished part in the"
14090,SECT. I.,"Second Book is political only, and has no concern with his military"
14091,SECT. I.,"qualifications. His ordinary military exploits elsewhere are secondary,"
14092,SECT. I.,and also scattered. To assign to him a great share in the field
14093,SECT. I.,"operations would have been a much less fine preparation, than the Iliad"
14094,SECT. I.,"now affords, for his appearance in the Odyssey; and it would also have"
14095,SECT. I.,hazarded sameness as between his achievements and the other ἀριστεῖα
14096,SECT. I.,"of the great chiefs. Besides, there was little room in the field, as"
14097,SECT. I.,"the martial art was then understood, for his distinctive qualities,"
14098,SECT. I.,"self-reliance, presence of mind, fertility in resource. But military"
14099,SECT. I.,"distinction, even in the time of Homer, lay in two great departments,"
14100,SECT. I.,"one known as the fight (μάχη), the other as ambush (λόχος). The latter"
14101,SECT. I.,"was of fully equal, nay, on account of its sharper trial of moral"
14102,SECT. I.,"courage[731], it was even of still greater honour. To this class the"
14103,SECT. I.,night adventure essentially belonged. Here Ulysses is thoroughly at
14104,SECT. I.,"home. In the Doloneia, Diomed is merely the sword in the hand of"
14105,SECT. I.,"Ulysses; who directs the operation, and overrules his brave companion"
14106,SECT. I.,"when he thinks fit, as, for example, in the matter of the slaughter"
14107,SECT. I.,of Dolon. In what other way could Homer have given us an equally
14108,SECT. I.,characteristic illustration of the military qualities of Ulysses?
14109,SECT. I.,
14110,SECT. I.,[731] See Il. i. 226-8. xviii. 509-13. and especially xiii. 275-86: and

14115,SECT. I.,"Now this view of the Doloneia fills up, I think, what must otherwise"
14116,SECT. I.,"be admitted to be a gap in the poem. It being thus filled up, let us"
14117,SECT. I.,observe the accuracy with which shares in the action of the poem are
14118,SECT. I.,assigned to the respective chiefs. Nestor has his own place apart as
14119,SECT. I.,"universal counsellor. Ulysses also, who, as the great twin conception"
14120,SECT. I.,"to Achilles, must never be allowed to appear in a light of inferiority"
14121,SECT. I.,"to any one, is so managed as not to eclipse the might of Ajax or the"
14122,SECT. I.,bravery of Diomed; and yet he has all his attributes kept entire for
14123,SECT. I.,"the great part he had to play in the Odyssey, and is never beaten,"
14124,SECT. I.,"never baffled, never excelled. Then Ajax, Diomed, Agamemnon, Menelaus,"
14125,SECT. I.,"even elderly Idomeneus, have each the stage made clear for them at"
14126,SECT. I.,"different times, and with scope proportioned to their several claims"
14127,SECT. I.,upon us. The very intervals between their several appearances are
14128,SECT. I.,made as wide as possible: for Diomed is in the Fifth and Eleventh
14129,SECT. I.,"Books, Ajax in the Seventh, Agamemnon in the Eleventh, Idomeneus in"
14130,SECT. I.,"the Thirteenth[732], Menelaus in the Seventeenth. Ajax excels in sheer"
14131,SECT. I.,"might, Diomed in pure gallantry of soul, and what is called _dash_;"
14132,SECT. I.,"Agamemnon’s dignity as a warrior is most skilfully maintained, yet"
14133,SECT. I.,without his being brought into rivalry with those two still greater
14134,SECT. I.,"heroes, by Hector’s being counselled to avoid him. Menelaus, secondary"
14135,SECT. I.,"in mere force, though with a spirit no less brave than gentle, is"
14136,SECT. I.,carried well through by the care taken that he shall only meet with
14137,SECT. I.,"appropriate adversaries, and the same pains are employed on behalf of"
14138,SECT. I.,"Idomeneus. For Patroclus, as the friend and second self of Achilles,"
14139,SECT. I.,"Homer’s fertile invention has secured a kind of distinction, which"
14140,SECT. I.,"does not displace that of others, and which, notwithstanding, is"
14141,SECT. I.,eclipsed by none of them. He turns the Trojan host; he slays the great
14142,SECT. I.,Sarpedon; he is himself slain only by foul play. I cannot vindicate
14143,SECT. I.,"the clumsy intervention of Apollo, and the meanness of the part"
14144,SECT. I.,played by Hector in this cardinal passage of his career; still I find
14145,SECT. I.,it curious and instructive to observe in all this a new instance of
14146,SECT. I.,"the intense care, with which the Poet watches over the character"
14147,SECT. I.,"especially of his Achilles. He exalts him, by exalting first those"
14148,SECT. I.,"secondary eminences, far above which he keeps him towering. Therefore"
14149,SECT. I.,"he would have Patroclus slain indeed, but not defeated, by Hector; and"
14150,SECT. I.,"to this capital object he appears to have made, perhaps unavoidably,"
14151,SECT. I.,considerable sacrifices.
14152,SECT. I.,
14153,SECT. I.,[732] He bears the chief part from 206. to 488.
14154,SECT. I.,
14155,SECT. I.,"Upon the whole, then, it would seem that Homer had to maintain a"
14156,SECT. I.,complex regard to a variety of objects. First of all there was the
14157,SECT. I.,relation to observe between Achilles and all the other personages of
14158,SECT. I.,his poem on both sides of the quarrel. Then in distributing his minor
14159,SECT. I.,"Alps, the other prime or distinguished Greek warriors, about this"
14160,SECT. I.,"great Alp, he had to keep in mind and provide for their relations to"
14161,SECT. I.,"one another, as well as to him. Lastly, he had to carry Hector and the"
14162,SECT. I.,"Trojans so high, that to overcome their chief should be his crowning"
14163,SECT. I.,"exploit, and yet so low, that they should not stand inconveniently"
14164,SECT. I.,"between the Greeks and the view of such national heroes as Ulysses,"
14165,SECT. I.,"Diomed, Ajax, and Agamemnon. Like Jupiter on Ida[733], from none of"
14166,SECT. I.,these objects has he ever removed his bright and watchful eye; for all
14167,SECT. I.,of them he has made a provision alike deliberate and skilful.

14189,SECT. I.,"of severe discipline patiently endured, has awarded to him a peaceful"
14190,SECT. I.,"old age, and a calm death, in his Ithaca barren but beloved, with"
14191,SECT. I.,"his people prospering around him. Achilles, on the other hand, is so"
14192,SECT. I.,"loaded with gorgeous gifts that, wonderful as is their harmony in all"
14193,SECT. I.,"points but one, that one is the centre. He has not the same unfailing"
14194,SECT. I.,"and central solidity of moral equipoise. In himself gallant, just,"
14195,SECT. I.,"generous, refined, still indignity can drive him into an extremity of"
14196,SECT. I.,"pride and fierceness, which call for stern correction. Hence it comes"
14197,SECT. I.,"about that, while the adversity of Ulysses is the way to peace, the"
14198,SECT. I.,transcendent glory of Achilles is attended by a series of devouring
14199,SECT. I.,agonies; the rival excitements of fierce pain and fiercer pleasure
14200,SECT. I.,"accompany him along a path, which soon and suddenly descends into the"
14201,SECT. I.,"night of dismal death. Alike in the one case and in the other, the"
14202,SECT. I.,"balance of the moral order is preserved; and that Erinūs, who, in so"
14203,SECT. I.,"many particular passages of the poems, makes miniature appearances in"
14204,SECT. I.,"order to vindicate the eternal laws, such as the heroic age apprehended"
14205,SECT. I.,"them, likewise presides in full development over the general action of"
14206,SECT. I.,each of these extraordinary poems.

14213,SECT. I.,"summit of his pride. It is in no light or joyous mood, that he repels"
14214,SECT. I.,"the Envoys. Who among readers does not seem to _see_ his spirit writhe,"
14215,SECT. I.,"when he describes the hot and bursting resentment in his breast, the"
14216,SECT. I.,stinging recollection of the outrages he has undergone[735]. Even by
14217,SECT. I.,"the irrepressible curiosity, which compels him to mount upon his ship"
14218,SECT. I.,"for view, and to send out Patroclus to learn the course of the battle,"

14225,SECT. I.,and the first Greek ship burns. Achilles must not depart from his word:
14226,SECT. I.,"but his restlessness now conceives an expedient, the sending forth of"
14227,SECT. I.,"Patroclus to the fight. At the same time, he takes every precaution"
14228,SECT. I.,"that sagacity can suggest: he clothes his friend in his own armour,"
14229,SECT. I.,"exhorts the Myrmidons to support him, above all enjoins him to confine"
14230,SECT. I.,"himself to defensive warfare, and not to follow the Trojans, when"
14231,SECT. I.,"repulsed, to the city. What then happens to him? That which often"
14232,SECT. I.,"befalls ourselves: that when we have turned our back upon wisdom,"
14233,SECT. I.,wisdom turns her back upon us. Achilles insisted upon the disaster
14234,SECT. I.,"of his countrymen. When it came, it constrained him to send out his"
14235,SECT. I.,friend: and the calamity he had himself invoked was death to the man
14236,SECT. I.,that he loved better than his own soul.
14237,SECT. I.,
14238,SECT. I.,And why did Patroclus die? It was not that Achilles imprudently exposed
14239,SECT. I.,him to risks beyond his strength. He was abundantly able to encounter
14240,SECT. I.,"Hector. Hector had no care, so long as the battle was by the ships,"
14241,SECT. I.,to encounter this chief. And Achilles had enjoined him to fight by
14242,SECT. I.,"the ships only, lest, if he attempted the city, a deity should take"
14243,SECT. I.,"part against him[736]. Patroclus disobeyed, and perished accordingly."
14244,SECT. I.,"As Achilles had refused to follow the laws of wisdom for himself, so,"
14245,SECT. I.,"when he carefully obeyed them, they were not to avail him for the"
14246,SECT. I.,"saving of his friend. Heaven fought against Patroclus; Jupiter, after"
14247,SECT. I.,"deliberation, tempted him from the ships, by causing Hector to fly"
14248,SECT. I.,towards the city; and the counsel of Achilles was now baffled as he
14249,SECT. I.,"had baffled the counsels of others, the dart was launched that was to"
14250,SECT. I.,pierce his soul to the quick.

14259,SECT. I.,"preternatural, with the whole world as it were, and all its forces,"
14260,SECT. I.,in subjection to his arm! But he has only passed from one excess of

14263,SECT. I.,The mutilation and dishonour of the body of his slain antagonist now

14269,SECT. I.,"Achilles must surrender the darling object of his desire, the wreaking"
14270,SECT. I.,"of his vengeance on an inanimate corpse. On this occasion, as before,"
14271,SECT. I.,he is subdued: and both times it is through the medium of his tender
14272,SECT. I.,affections. But in both cases his evil gratification is cut short: and
14273,SECT. I.,the authority of the providential order is reestablished. The Greeks
14274,SECT. I.,pursue their righteous war: the respect which nature enjoins is duly

14291,SECT. II.,"signal known manifestation in the human form, and again the φθορὰ, or"
14292,SECT. II.,"corruption of that idea, have each their separate course and history"
14293,SECT. II.,"in the religion and manners, as well as in the arts, of Greece. By the"
14294,SECT. II.,"idea of Beauty, I mean here the conception of it in the human mind as"
14295,SECT. II.,"a pure and wonderful essence, nearly akin to the Divine; derived from"
14296,SECT. II.,"heaven, and both continually and spontaneously tending to revert to its"
14297,SECT. II.,"source. By the corruption of that idea, I mean the conception of it"

14300,SECT. II.,

14305,SECT. II.,"is to say, in the Homeric descriptions of human characters and life,"
14306,SECT. II.,we never find Beauty and Vice pleasurably associated: he seems to
14307,SECT. II.,"have felt in the sanctuary of his mind as much at least as this, if"
14308,SECT. II.,not more; that a derogation from purity involved of itself a descent
14309,SECT. II.,from the highest to a lower form of beauty: and therefore he never
14310,SECT. II.,associates his highest descriptions of beauty with vice: differing

14317,SECT. II.,"of popular tradition on the subject of beauty had begun to descend,"
14318,SECT. II.,"and though he had escaped the taint, yet it had touched his age."
14319,SECT. II.,"Let us, for example, take that most striking series of traditions"
14320,SECT. II.,"in the Dardanian royal family, which are recorded in the poems of"
14321,SECT. II.,Homer. That family appears to have had personal beauty for an almost
14322,SECT. II.,"entailed inheritance. Not only Hector, Deiphobus, Æneas, as well as"
14323,SECT. II.,"Paris, possessed it, but Priam, even in his old age and affliction,"
14324,SECT. II.,"was divinely beautiful as he entered the apartment of Achilles; and,"
14325,SECT. II.,"as they sat at meat, and he admired Achilles, Achilles returned his"

14329,SECT. II.,
14330,SECT. II.,"The line of traditions in this family, to which I now refer, affords"
14331,SECT. II.,"the best illustration of the idea of beauty as ever striving, by"
14332,SECT. II.,"an inner law, to rise to a heavenly life. There are four of these"
14333,SECT. II.,"traditions: and as we pass from the older to the more recent, at"
14334,SECT. II.,"each step that we make, we lose some grain of the first ethereal"
14335,SECT. II.,"purity. The earliest of them all is the translation, since coarsely"
14336,SECT. II.,"and without ground called the rape, of Ganymede: consistently indeed"
14337,SECT. II.,"so called, according to the idea of the fable which has prevailed in"
14338,SECT. II.,"later ages, but most absurdly, if it be applied to the tradition in"
14339,SECT. II.,the shape in which it stands with Homer. With him the tale of Ganymede
14340,SECT. II.,"is the most simple and perfect assertion of the principle that beauty,"
14341,SECT. II.,"heavenly in its origin, is heavenly also in its destiny; and that"
14342,SECT. II.,the heaven-born and heaven-bound should contract no taint upon its
14343,SECT. II.,"intermediate passage. There were three sons, says Homer, born to Tros;"
14344,SECT. II.,"Ilus was one, Assaracus another: and the third was Ganymede, a match"
14345,SECT. II.,"for gods. Ganymede, the most beauteous of men, whom, for his beauty,"
14346,SECT. II.,"and seemingly before he had come to maturity for succession, the gods"
14347,SECT. II.,"snatched up and made the cupbearer of Jupiter, that he might dwell for"

14360,SECT. II.,"that he might not linger, might not suffer, might not contract taint"
14361,SECT. II.,"or undergo decay on earth, was taken up to that sphere, which is the"

14363,SECT. II.,
14364,SECT. II.,The thought is somewhat related to that of the following remarkable

14367,SECT. II.,"Perchance not he, but nature ailed;"
14368,SECT. II.,"The world, and not the infant, failed."

14382,SECT. II.,"of the same tale. Thus, in Euripides, we find him the Διὸς λέκτρων"
14383,SECT. II.,"τρύφημα φίλον (Iph. Aul. 1037): and what is more sad is to find, that"
14384,SECT. II.,this utterly debased and depressed idea prevailed over the original and
14385,SECT. II.,"pure one, even to its extinction, and was adopted and propagated by the"
14386,SECT. II.,highest and the lowest poets of the Italian romance[740].
14387,SECT. II.,
14388,SECT. II.,"[740] For example, we might quote the Orlando Furioso of Ariosto; and"

14398,SECT. II.,which capacity he remained in the upper regions[741]. This is a step
14399,SECT. II.,"downwards; but the next is a stride. In the third tradition, so far as"
14400,SECT. II.,"is known from the authentic works of Homer, Æneas is the son of Venus"
14401,SECT. II.,"and Anchises, but without their standing in the relation of husband and"
14402,SECT. II.,"wife. The particulars of the narrative are supplied in the early Hymn,"
14403,SECT. II.,"which perhaps was the more readily ascribed to Homer, because it was"
14404,SECT. II.,believed to embody a primitive form of the tradition. Jupiter inspired
14405,SECT. II.,"Venus with a passion for Anchises, and, after having arrayed herself in"
14406,SECT. II.,"fine vestments and golden ornaments, she presented herself to him as he"
14407,SECT. II.,was playing the lyre in solitude on Ida; when the connection was formed

14461,SECT. II.,"instance where he does so assign it, he seems to follow an historical"

14511,SECT. II.,and appearances to bring up the Trojan chieftains and people to some
14512,SECT. II.,kind of level with the Greek. Yet there is something singular in the
14513,SECT. II.,"fact that Homer, who does not, I think, repeat his similes in any other"
14514,SECT. II.,"remarkable case, reproduces the whole of this splendid passage in the"
14515,SECT. II.,"Fifteenth Iliad for Hector[751]. There is here, we may rely upon it,"
14516,SECT. II.,some peculiar meaning. Possibly he grudged the exclusive appropriation
14517,SECT. II.,of so splendid a passage to so despicable a person. There is also
14518,SECT. II.,another singularity in his mode of proceeding. The simile is given to
14519,SECT. II.,"Hector without addition, and the poem proceeds"
14520,SECT. II.,
14521,SECT. II.,[751] Il. xv. 263.
14522,SECT. II.,
14523,SECT. II.,ὣς Ἕκτωρ λαιψηρὰ πόδας καὶ γούνατ’ ἐνώμα.
14524,SECT. II.,
14525,SECT. II.,"But where he applies it to Paris, immediately after the conclusion of"
14526,SECT. II.,"the noble passage he subjoins (Il. vi. 512.),"
14527,SECT. II.,
14528,SECT. II.,ὣς υἱὸς Πριάμοιο Πάρις κατὰ Περγάμου ἄκρης
14529,SECT. II.,"τεύχεσι παμφαίνων, ὥστ’ ἠλέκτωρ, ἐβεβήκει."
14530,SECT. II.,
14531,SECT. II.,What is the meaning of ἠλέκτωρ? It is commonly taken as equivalent to
14532,SECT. II.,"ἠλέκτωρ Ὑπερίων, which means the Sun. I cannot but believe that Homer"
14533,SECT. II.,"means by it to signify the cock, called in Greek ἀλέκτωρ. The ἠλέκτωρ"
14534,SECT. II.,"Ὑπερίων, is used as a simile for Achilles; and it would be much against"
14535,SECT. II.,"the manner of Homer to use the same simile for a Trojan, and that"
14536,SECT. II.,Trojan Paris. Whereas by the strut of the cock he may mean to reduce
14537,SECT. II.,and modify the effect of the noble figure of the stall-horse.

14540,SECT. II.,
14541,SECT. II.,"Achilles, who is not only the bravest but by far the most powerful man"
14542,SECT. II.,"of the host, is also by far the most beautiful; and the very strongest"
14543,SECT. II.,terms are used to describe the impression which his appearance produced
14544,SECT. II.,on Priam amidst the profoundest sorrow[752];
14545,SECT. II.,
14546,SECT. II.,[752] Il. xxiv. 629.

14549,SECT. II.,"ὅσσος ἔην, οἷός τε· θεοῖσι γὰρ ἄντα ἐῴκει."
14550,SECT. II.,
14551,SECT. II.,"It may be doubted, whether any other Poet would have ventured to"
14552,SECT. II.,"combine the highest and most delicate beauty, with a strength and size"
14553,SECT. II.,"approaching the superhuman. It was requisite for Achilles, as the"
14554,SECT. II.,"ideal man, not only to want no great human gift, but also to have in"
14555,SECT. II.,unmatched degrees whatever gifts he possessed. The beauty of Achilles
14556,SECT. II.,is the true counterpart to the ugliness and deformity of Thersites.
14557,SECT. II.,
14558,SECT. II.,"It appertains to the character of Ulysses, who comes next to Achilles,"
14559,SECT. II.,that he too should not be wanting in any thing that pertains to the
14560,SECT. II.,excellence of human nature; while completeness and manifoldness is
14561,SECT. II.,"the specific character of his endowments, as unparalleled splendour"
14562,SECT. II.,"is of those possessed by Achilles. Ulysses[753], therefore, is also"
14563,SECT. II.,"beautiful. Again, the office and function of Agamemnon require him"
14564,SECT. II.,"to be an object capable of attracting admiration and reverence. He,"
14565,SECT. II.,"accordingly, is of remarkable beauty, but of the kind of beauty that"
14566,SECT. II.,has in it most of dignity[754];
14567,SECT. II.,
14568,SECT. II.,[753] Od. xiii. 430-3.

14574,SECT. II.,
14575,SECT. II.,"Homer never absolutely withholds beauty from any of his Greek heroes,"
14576,SECT. II.,yet he does not always expressly state that they possessed it. This
14577,SECT. II.,"endowment is, for instance, never given to Diomed, but it is ascribed"
14578,SECT. II.,to Ajax in the Eleventh Odyssey[755];

14583,SECT. II.,"τῶν ἄλλων Δαναῶν, μετ’ ἀμύμονα Πηλείωνα."
14584,SECT. II.,
14585,SECT. II.,"It is probably because Diomed equals Ajax in chivalry, and very far"
14586,SECT. II.,"excels him in mental gifts, that Homer has thrown weight into the scale"
14587,SECT. II.,"of Ajax by assigning to him expressly, while he is silent about Diomed,"
14588,SECT. II.,the gift of a beautiful person.
14589,SECT. II.,
14590,SECT. II.,"As with individuals, so does Homer deal with masses. It may be observed"
14591,SECT. II.,"that he has a lower class of epithets for the Trojans than the Greeks,"
14592,SECT. II.,and never allows them the benefit of the same national designations.
14593,SECT. II.,Individual beauty in men is confined on both sides to the higher ranks;
14594,SECT. II.,"but no Trojan, however beautiful, is ever honoured with the title"
14595,SECT. II.,"of ξανθός. Again, while he never gives to the Trojans as a body any"
14596,SECT. II.,"epithet which describes them as possessed of beauty, he has assigned"
14597,SECT. II.,several expressions of this order to the Greek race. Such are the
14598,SECT. II.,"epithets καρηκομόωντες and ἑλίκωπες, and the phrase εἶδος ἀγητοὶ, (Il."
14599,SECT. II.,v. 787. viii. 228.)
14600,SECT. II.,
14601,SECT. II.,~_Beauty of Nireus and others._~
14602,SECT. II.,
14603,SECT. II.,We have yet to examine how far Homer makes beauty a title to
14604,SECT. II.,distinguished notice on behalf of those who have no other claim. The
14605,SECT. II.,"passage in the Catalogue, where Nireus is named[756], is highly curious"
14606,SECT. II.,with reference to this part of the subject. It is as follows:
14607,SECT. II.,
14608,SECT. II.,[756] Il. ii. 671-5.
14609,SECT. II.,
14610,SECT. II.,"Νιρεὺς αὖ Σύμηθεν ἄγε τρεῖς νῆας ἐΐσας,"
14611,SECT. II.,"Νιρεὺς, Ἀγλαΐης υἱὸς Χαρόποιό τ’ ἄνακτος,"
14612,SECT. II.,"Νιρεὺς, ὃς κάλλιστος ἀνὴρ ὑπὸ Ἴλιον ἦλθεν"
14613,SECT. II.,"τῶν ἄλλων Δαναῶν, μετ’ ἀμύμονα Πηλείωνα·"
14614,SECT. II.,"ἀλλ’ ἀλαπαδνὸς ἔην, παῦρος δέ οἱ εἵπετο λαός."
14615,SECT. II.,
14616,SECT. II.,These five lines form the largest of the merely personal descriptions
14617,SECT. II.,"contained in the Catalogue. Yet they are given to a man, of whom we are"
14618,SECT. II.,"frankly told that he was a poor creature, and that he had but a small"
14619,SECT. II.,following. Even this does not show the whole strength of the case.
14620,SECT. II.,
14621,SECT. II.,"1. His ships were only three: no other commander, having so few, is"
14622,SECT. II.,named at all. The next smallest number is seven: these were the vessels
14623,SECT. II.,"of Philoctetes, and they seem to be named on account of his peculiar"
14624,SECT. II.,history and great merit.
14625,SECT. II.,
14626,SECT. II.,"2. This is the only instance, in which the contingent supplied by a"
14627,SECT. II.,single and wholly insignificant place is named by itself.
14628,SECT. II.,
14629,SECT. II.,"3. This is also one among very few cases of an ordinary birth, where"
14630,SECT. II.,the mother (Aglaïe) is named as well as the father (Charopos): the
14631,SECT. II.,others are usually cases of reputed descent from deities or heroes.
14632,SECT. II.,
14633,SECT. II.,4. The names given to both parents are taken from their personal
14634,SECT. II.,"beauty. They thus enhance the title of the son; and, as we cannot well"
14635,SECT. II.,"suppose them connected with history, they were probably invented by the"
14636,SECT. II.,Poet for that purpose.
14637,SECT. II.,
14638,SECT. II.,"5. The repetition of the name of Nireus thrice, and in each case at"
14639,SECT. II.,"the beginning of the verse, the most prominent and emphatic part of it"
14640,SECT. II.,"according to the genius of the Greek hexameter, is plainly intentional."
14641,SECT. II.,
14642,SECT. II.,"6. All this care is taken in the most ingenious manner to mark a man,"
14643,SECT. II.,who did nothing to enable Homer to name him in any other part of the
14644,SECT. II.,Iliad.
14645,SECT. II.,
14646,SECT. II.,"One and one only key is to be found, which will lay open the cause of"
14647,SECT. II.,"these singular provisions: it is Homer’s intense love of beauty, which"
14648,SECT. II.,"made it in his eyes of itself a title to celebrity. So he determined,"
14649,SECT. II.,"apparently, that the paragon of form should be immortal; and he has"
14650,SECT. II.,"given effect to his determination, for no reader of the Iliad can pass"
14651,SECT. II.,by the place without remembering Nireus.
14652,SECT. II.,
14653,SECT. II.,"In a less marked manner, he has given a kindred emphasis to the case"
14654,SECT. II.,"of Nastes, who wore golden ornaments, and therefore was presumably of"
14655,SECT. II.,strikingly handsome person. With his brother Amphimachus he commanded
14656,SECT. II.,"the Carians, and his name is mentioned thrice (but that of his brother"
14657,SECT. II.,"twice only), together with the fact that he wore gold like a girl[757]."
14658,SECT. II.,
14659,SECT. II.,[757] Il. ii. 867.
14660,SECT. II.,
14661,SECT. II.,"There is something, as it appears to me, most tender and refined, in"
14662,SECT. II.,this mode used by Homer of fastening attention through repetition of
14663,SECT. II.,"the word, which he wishes gently but firmly to stamp upon the memory."
14664,SECT. II.,"We have another instance of it in Il. xxii. 127,"
14665,SECT. II.,
14666,SECT. II.,"ἅτε παρθένος ἠΐθεός τε,"
14667,SECT. II.,παρθένος ἠΐθεός τ’ ὀαρίζετον ἀλλήλοιϊν.
14668,SECT. II.,
14669,SECT. II.,There is yet another passage which affords a striking proof of what
14670,SECT. II.,may be called the worship of beauty in Homer. In the Seventeenth
14671,SECT. II.,"Iliad, Euphorbus, the son of Panthoos, falls by the hand of Menelaus."
14672,SECT. II.,"Homer gives him great credit for charioteering, the use of the spear,"
14673,SECT. II.,and other accomplishments; but he performs no other feat in the poem
14674,SECT. II.,"than that of wounding in the back the disarmed, and astounded, and"
14675,SECT. II.,"heaven-deserted Patroclus. At best, we must call him a very secondary"
14676,SECT. II.,personage. Though his personal comeliness was not defaced like that
14677,SECT. II.,"of Paris by cowardice or vice, still he was of the same race that in"
14678,SECT. II.,Italy has taken its name from Zerbino. Yet Homer adorns his death with
14679,SECT. II.,"a notice, perhaps more conspicuous than any which he has attached to"
14680,SECT. II.,"the death of any warriors of the Iliad, with the exceptions of Hector,"
14681,SECT. II.,"Sarpedon, and Patroclus. Ten of the most beautiful lines of the poem"
14682,SECT. II.,"are bestowed in lamenting him, chiefly by an unsurpassed simile, which"
14683,SECT. II.,"compares the youth to a tender olive shoot, the victim, when its"
14684,SECT. II.,"blossoms are overcharged with moisture, of a sudden hurricane. The Poet"
14685,SECT. II.,"was moved to this tenderness by the remembrance of his beauty, of his"
14686,SECT. II.,"hair, like the hair of the Graces, in its tresses bound with golden and"
14687,SECT. II.,silver clasps[758].
14688,SECT. II.,
14689,SECT. II.,[758] Il. xvii. 50-60. Compare the sympathizing account of the death of
14690,SECT. II.,the _young_ bridegroom Iphidamas (Il. xi. 241-3).
14691,SECT. II.,
14692,SECT. II.,~_Beauty placed among the prime gifts._~
14693,SECT. II.,
14694,SECT. II.,"Although it is true that Homer eschews with respect to beauty, as well"
14695,SECT. II.,"as in other matters, the didactic mode of conveying his impressions,"
14696,SECT. II.,yet he has placed them distinctly on record in the answer of Ulysses to
14697,SECT. II.,"Euryalus. Speaking not at all of women, but of men, he places the gift"
14698,SECT. II.,of personal beauty among the prime endowments that can be received from
14699,SECT. II.,"the providence of the gods, in a rank to which only two other gifts are"
14700,SECT. II.,"admitted, namely, the power of thought (νόος or φρένες), and the power"
14701,SECT. II.,"of speech (ἀγορητύς). In the idea of personal beauty, conveyed under"
14702,SECT. II.,"the names εἶδος, μορφὴ, and χάρις, evidently included vigour and power,"
14703,SECT. II.,"for it is to his supposed incapacity for athletic exercises[759], that"
14704,SECT. II.,"the discourse has reference. Nor can it be said, that this full and"
14705,SECT. II.,"large appreciation by Homer of the value of bodily excellence, was"
14706,SECT. II.,"simply a worldly or a pagan, as opposed to a Christian, view."
14707,SECT. II.,
14708,SECT. II.,[759] Od. viii. 167-77.
14709,SECT. II.,
14710,SECT. II.,"It is not true, on the one hand, that when we cease to entertain"
14711,SECT. II.,sufficiently elevated views of the destiny and prerogatives of the
14712,SECT. II.,"soul, our standard for the body rises either in proportion or at all."
14713,SECT. II.,"Nor is it true, on the other, that when we think highly of the soul,"
14714,SECT. II.,"we ought in consequence to think meanly of the body, which is both its"
14715,SECT. II.,"tabernacle and its helpmate. In truth, a somewhat sickly cast seems"
14716,SECT. II.,"to have come over our tone of thought now for some generations back,"
14717,SECT. II.,"the product, perhaps, in part of careless or emasculated teaching"
14718,SECT. II.,"in the highest matters, and due also in part to the overcrowding of"
14719,SECT. II.,the several functions of our life. But Homer distinctly realized to
14720,SECT. II.,"himself what we know faintly or scarce at all, though nothing is more"
14721,SECT. II.,"emphatically or conspicuously taught by our religion, namely, that the"
14722,SECT. II.,body is part and parcel of the integer denominated man.
14723,SECT. II.,
14724,SECT. II.,But the quality of measure ran in rare proportion through all the
14725,SECT. II.,conceptions of the Poet. Stature was a great element of beauty in the
14726,SECT. II.,view of the ancients for women as well as for men: and their admiration
14727,SECT. II.,"of tallness, even in women, is hardly restrained by a limit. But"
14728,SECT. II.,"Homer, who frequently touches the point, has provided a limit. Among"
14729,SECT. II.,"the Læstrygonians, the women are of enormous size. Two of the crew of"
14730,SECT. II.,"Ulysses, sent forward to make inquiries, are introduced to the queen."
14731,SECT. II.,"They find her ‘as big as a mountain,’ and are disgusted at her[760]:"
14732,SECT. II.,
14733,SECT. II.,[760] Od. x. 112.
14734,SECT. II.,
14735,SECT. II.,τὴν δὲ γυναῖκα
14736,SECT. II.,"εὗρον ὅσην τ’ ὄρεος κορυφὴν, κατὰ δ’ ἔστυγον αὐτήν."
14737,SECT. II.,
14738,SECT. II.,"The large humanity of Homer is also manifested, among other signs, by"
14739,SECT. II.,his sympathy with high qualities in the animal creation. There is no
14740,SECT. II.,"passage of deeper pathos in all his works, not Andromache with her"
14741,SECT. II.,"child, not Priam before Achilles, than that which recounts the death"
14742,SECT. II.,"of the dog Argus[761]. The words too are so calm and still, they seem"
14743,SECT. II.,"to grow faint and fainter, each foot of the verse falls as if it were"
14744,SECT. II.,"counting out the last respirations, and, in effect, we witness that"
14745,SECT. II.,"last slight and scarcely fluttering breath, with which life is yielded"
14746,SECT. II.,up:
14747,SECT. II.,
14748,SECT. II.,[761] Od. xvii. 327.

14752,SECT. II.,
14753,SECT. II.,"We may also trace the same sympathy in minor forms. As, for"
14754,SECT. II.,"instance, where he says Telemachus went to the Ithacan assembly not"
14755,SECT. II.,unattended[762]:

14761,SECT. II.,
14762,SECT. II.,"We are certainly prepared to hear that some adviser, either divine or"
14763,SECT. II.,"at the least human, some friend or faithful servant, was by his side:"
14764,SECT. II.,but no--it is simply that some dogs went with him:
14765,SECT. II.,
14766,SECT. II.,ἅμα τῷγε κύνες πόδας ἀργοὶ ἕποντο.
14767,SECT. II.,
14768,SECT. II.,"There is no sign, however, that Homer attached the peculiar idea of"
14769,SECT. II.,"beauty to the race of dogs in any remarkable degree. Indeed, it is only"
14770,SECT. II.,in certain breeds that the dog can be called by comparison a beautiful
14771,SECT. II.,animal. What he always commends is their swiftness; and Homer’s ideas
14772,SECT. II.,of beauty were nowhere more lively than in regard to motion. But we see
14773,SECT. II.,the Poet’s feeling for form much more characteristically displayed in
14774,SECT. II.,the case to which we shall now proceed.
14775,SECT. II.,
14776,SECT. II.,"~_Beauty in animals, especially horses._~"
14777,SECT. II.,
14778,SECT. II.,Among other inferences which the poems raise in respect to Homer
14779,SECT. II.,"himself, it can hardly be doubted that he was a great lover of horses,"
14780,SECT. II.,"and felt their beauty, partially in colour, much more in form, and in"
14781,SECT. II.,movement most of all.
14782,SECT. II.,
14783,SECT. II.,This was quite in keeping with the habits of his country and his race.
14784,SECT. II.,Both the Trojans and the Greeks appear not only to have employed horses
14785,SECT. II.,"in such uses as war, journeys, races, and agricultural labour, but to"
14786,SECT. II.,have given attention to developing the breeds and points of the animal.
14787,SECT. II.,"In his Catalogue, Homer, at the close, invokes the Muse to inform him"
14788,SECT. II.,"which were the best of the horses, as well as of the heroes, on the"
14789,SECT. II.,Greek side. He constantly uses epithets both for Trojans and Greeks
14790,SECT. II.,connected with their successful care and training of the animal:
14791,SECT. II.,"εὔιππος, εὔπωλος, ταχύπωλος, ἱππόδαμος."
14792,SECT. II.,
14793,SECT. II.,"He not only treasures the traditions connected with the animal, but"
14794,SECT. II.,"treats them as a part of history. Accordingly, when Diomed desires"
14795,SECT. II.,Sthenelus to make sure of the horses of Æneas he carefully proceeds to
14796,SECT. II.,"state, that it is because their sires were of the race that Jupiter"
14797,SECT. II.,"gave to Tros. To them Anchises, without the knowledge of their owner"
14798,SECT. II.,"Laomedon, brought his own mares, and so obtained a progeny of six:"
14799,SECT. II.,"of whom he kept four himself, and gave two to his son Æneas (Il. v."
14800,SECT. II.,265-73) that he might take them to Troy.
14801,SECT. II.,
14802,SECT. II.,"Nay he goes back further yet: where, except in Homer, should we find a"
14803,SECT. II.,"tradition like that of the mares of Erichthonius, fetched from a time"
14804,SECT. II.,five generations before his subject? Their children had Boreas for
14805,SECT. II.,"their sire. Three thousand mothers ranged over the plains of the Troad,"
14806,SECT. II.,"and made their lord the wealthiest of men. So light was their footstep,"
14807,SECT. II.,that if they skimmed the sea it touched the tips only of the curling
14808,SECT. II.,"foam; and if they raced over the cornfield, the ripe ears sustained"
14809,SECT. II.,their tread without one being broken[763].
14810,SECT. II.,

14812,SECT. II.,
14813,SECT. II.,"~_As to movement, form, and colour._~"
14814,SECT. II.,
14815,SECT. II.,In other places Homer describes with no less of sympathetic emotion the
14816,SECT. II.,vivid and fiery movements of the animal. The most remarkable of all is
14817,SECT. II.,"the noble simile of the stall-kept horse, whom every reader seems to"
14818,SECT. II.,"see as with proud head and flowing mane, when he feels his liberty, he"
14819,SECT. II.,scours the boundless pastures.
14820,SECT. II.,
14821,SECT. II.,"That adaptation, or effort at adaptation, of sound to sense, which with"
14822,SECT. II.,"poets in general (always excepting especially Dante and Shakespeare,)"
14823,SECT. II.,is a sign that they have applied their whole force to careful
14824,SECT. II.,"elaboration, is with Homer only a proof of a fuller and deeper flow"

14934,SECT. II.,"continues, do you fight, and I will drive; or, as you may choose, do"

14979,SECT. II.,
14980,SECT. II.,"It has been much debated whether the ancients generally, and whether"
14981,SECT. II.,"Homer in particular, had any distinct idea of beauty in landscape."
14982,SECT. II.,
14983,SECT. II.,"It may be admitted, even in respect to Homer, that his similes, to"
14984,SECT. II.,"which one would naturally look for proof, less commonly refer to the"
14985,SECT. II.,"eye than to other faculties. They commonly turn upon sound, motion,"
14986,SECT. II.,"force, or multitude: rarely, in comparison, upon colour, or even upon"
14987,SECT. II.,form; still more rarely upon colour or form in such combinations as to
14988,SECT. II.,constitute what we call the picturesque.
14989,SECT. II.,
14990,SECT. II.,"It seems to me, that we may draw the best materials of a demonstration"
14991,SECT. II.,in this case from comparing his descriptions of the form of scenery
14992,SECT. II.,"by means of the outlines of countries, with his use of other epithets"
14993,SECT. II.,which he employs to denote beauty.
14994,SECT. II.,
14995,SECT. II.,"The country of Lacedæmon was mountainous, and it is hence termed by"
14996,SECT. II.,"Homer in the Odyssey and in the Catalogue, κοιλή. (Il. ii. 581, Od. iv."
14997,SECT. II.,1.)
14998,SECT. II.,
14999,SECT. II.,"But it is also termed by him ἐρατεινὴ (Il. iii. 239), and this, it may"
15000,SECT. II.,"be observed, in a speech of Helen’s; to whom, while she was at Troy,"
15001,SECT. II.,"the image of it in memory could hardly, perhaps, be agreeable from any"
15002,SECT. II.,"moral association. We are, therefore, led to refer it to the physical"
15003,SECT. II.,conformation or beauty of the district.
15004,SECT. II.,
15005,SECT. II.,"Next, we have pretty clear proof that in Homer’s mind the epithet"
15006,SECT. II.,ἐρατεινὴ was one proper to describe beauty in the strictest sense. For
15007,SECT. II.,"he says of Helen, with regard to her daughter Hermione[774]:"
15008,SECT. II.,
15009,SECT. II.,[774] Od. iv. 13.
15010,SECT. II.,
15011,SECT. II.,"ἐγείνατο παῖδ’ ἐρατεινὴν,"

15013,SECT. II.,
15014,SECT. II.,"‘She had a lovely (ἐρατεινὴν) daughter, endowed with the beauty of"
15015,SECT. II.,"golden Aphrodite.’ And I observe but few passages in Homer, perhaps"
15016,SECT. II.,"only one (Od. xxiii. 300), when ἐρατεινὸς does not naturally and"
15017,SECT. II.,properly bear this sense. A sense etymologically analogous to our own
15018,SECT. II.,"use of the word _lovely_, which we employ to indicate not only beauty,"
15019,SECT. II.,but a high degree of it.
15020,SECT. II.,
15021,SECT. II.,"It therefore appears to be clear that Homer called Lacedæmon ἐρατεινὴ,"
15022,SECT. II.,"because it was shaped in mountain and valley, and because countries"
15023,SECT. II.,"so formed present a beautiful appearance to the eye, as compared with"
15024,SECT. II.,countries of other forms less marked. It is applied to Emathia (Il.
15025,SECT. II.,"xiv. 225) and to Scheria (Od. vii. 79), both mountainous; to the city"
15026,SECT. II.,"Ilios, (Il. v. 210), which stood on ground high and partially abrupt"
15027,SECT. II.,near the roots of Ida; and I do not find it in any place of the poems
15028,SECT. II.,associated with flat lands.
15029,SECT. II.,
15030,SECT. II.,The other instance which I shall cite seems to present the argument in
15031,SECT. II.,"a complete form, within the compass of a single line."
15032,SECT. II.,
15033,SECT. II.,"When describing Ithaca in the Odyssey, Telemachus says it is[775],"
15034,SECT. II.,
15035,SECT. II.,[775] Od. iv. 606.
15036,SECT. II.,
15037,SECT. II.,"αἰγίβοτος, καὶ μᾶλλον ἐπήρατος ἱπποβότοιο."
15038,SECT. II.,
15039,SECT. II.,"Here we may assume that by αἰγίβοτος, goat-feeding, he means"
15040,SECT. II.,"mountainous, and even sharp and rocky; moreover consequently, in"
15041,SECT. II.,"comparison, barren, so that it could not be agreeable in the sense of"
15042,SECT. II.,"being profitable. On the other hand, the horse is an animal ill-suited"
15043,SECT. II.,to range among rocks; and by ἱππόβοτος Homer always means a district or
15044,SECT. II.,country sufficiently open and plain to be suitable for feeding horses
15045,SECT. II.,"in numbers. Now, in saying that Arran is more ἐπήρατος than southern"
15046,SECT. II.,"Lancashire, we should leave no doubt upon the mind of any reader as"
15047,SECT. II.,to the meaning; which must surely be that it offers more beauty to the
15048,SECT. II.,eye. Just such a comparison does Homer make of the scenery of Ithaca as
15049,SECT. II.,"it was with what it would have been, if the island had been flat."
15050,SECT. II.,
15051,SECT. II.,"I ought however to notice the very forced interpretation of Damm, which"
15052,SECT. II.,"is this: _μᾶλλον ἐπήρατος, sc. ἐμοὶ, nam est patria mea; et ad μᾶλλον"
15053,SECT. II.,subintelligit τοῦ σοῦ Ἄργεος φίλη μοι ἔστι_.
15054,SECT. II.,
15055,SECT. II.,"Homer was better versed in the art of wedding words to thought, than"
15056,SECT. II.,"such an interpretation supposes. For, according to it, the thought"
15057,SECT. II.,"of Homer was this; ‘Though you rule over broad and open Argos, my"
15058,SECT. II.,"mountainous Ithaca is dearer to me, _because it is my country_.’ So"
15059,SECT. II.,"that he has left out the point of the sentence, without the faintest"
15060,SECT. II.,"trace to guide his reader. The idea of the sentence, which is prolonged"
15061,SECT. II.,"through many verses, turns entirely on the difference between an"
15062,SECT. II.,"open and a steep rocky country as such, and not in the least on"
15063,SECT. II.,"native attachments. And Telemachus, who is lauding the richness and"
15064,SECT. II.,"fertility of Argos, and apologizing for the barrenness of Ithaca,"
15065,SECT. II.,"not ungracefully, in passing, throws in, by way of compensation, the"
15066,SECT. II.,"element of beauty, as one possessed by Ithaca, and as one which it must"
15067,SECT. II.,miss if it were flat.
15068,SECT. II.,
15069,SECT. II.,"Indeed, we here trace the usual refinement of Homer in this, that"
15070,SECT. II.,"Telemachus does not say, True, your Argos is rich, but my Ithaca is"
15071,SECT. II.,"picturesque: but, after commending the fertility of broad Argos, he"
15072,SECT. II.,"says, ‘In Ithaca we have no broad runs[776], and nothing like a meadow:"
15073,SECT. II.,"it will feed nothing but goats, yet it is more picturesque than if"
15074,SECT. II.,"_it_, a little speck of that kind, were flat and open.’"
15075,SECT. II.,
15076,SECT. II.,[776] He uses the phrase δρόμοι εὐρέες. It is curious to find the word
15077,SECT. II.,"_runs_, so recently re-established as the classical word for the large"
15078,SECT. II.,open spaces of pasturage in the regions of Australasia.
15079,SECT. II.,
15080,SECT. II.,The word ἐπήρατος is less frequently used in Homer than ἐρατεινός;
15081,SECT. II.,but we have it in six places besides this. There is only one of them
15082,SECT. II.,"where it is capable of meaning dear, in connection with the idea of"
15083,SECT. II.,"country[777]. In another it means enjoyable or splendid, being applied"
15084,SECT. II.,to the banquet[778]. In the other places it is applied to a town on the
15085,SECT. II.,"Shield, a cavern in Ithaca (twice), and the garments put upon Venus in"
15086,SECT. II.,Cyprus; and in those four places it can only mean fair or beautiful.

15109,SECT. II.,Ithaca; and that rocks are never loved but as caves. I think that the
15110,SECT. II.,expressions I have produced from the text show that these propositions
15111,SECT. II.,cannot be sustained. At the same time I admit that the feeling with
15112,SECT. II.,"Homer is one in the bud only: as, indeed, until within a very few"
15113,SECT. II.,"generations, it has lain undeveloped among ourselves. Homer may have"
15114,SECT. II.,"been the father of this sentiment for his nation, as he was of so much"
15115,SECT. II.,besides. But the plant did not grow up kindly among those who followed

15122,SECT. II.,of Alcinous is truly Dutch in its quadrangular conceptions; but it is

15124,SECT. II.,"Symmetry, serenity, regularity, adopted from the forms of living beauty"

15157,SECT. II.,
15158,SECT. II.,"Upon the whole, considering Homer’s early date, and the very late"
15159,SECT. II.,development among the moderns of a taste for scenery of the picturesque
15160,SECT. II.,"and romantic order, I do not know that we are entitled even at first"
15161,SECT. II.,sight to challenge him as inferior to any modern of analogous date
15162,SECT. II.,in this province. Yet we may fairly pronounce that he is inferior to
15163,SECT. II.,"himself; that is to say, he appears to have a sense of beauty, in the"
15164,SECT. II.,"region of inanimate nature, certainly less keen in proportion than"
15165,SECT. II.,"that, with which he looked upon the animated creation."
15166,SECT. II.,
15167,SECT. II.,"What is deficient in him with respect to landscape may however, in all"
15168,SECT. II.,"likelihood, be more justly referred to positive than to negative causes."

15171,SECT. II.,
15172,SECT. II.,It may be questioned whether the disposition to appreciate still
15173,SECT. II.,"nature, especially in large and elaborated combinations, may not in"
15174,SECT. II.,part depend upon conditions that were not to be found in the age of
15175,SECT. II.,"Homer. I should say, if the expression may be allowed, that we of this"
15176,SECT. II.,generation take landscape medicinally. Human life grows with the course
15177,SECT. II.,"of ages; and, especially in our age, it has grown to be excited and"
15178,SECT. II.,"hurried. But nature has a reacting tendency towards repose; and, even"
15179,SECT. II.,"in the case of the grosser stimulants, it seems to be their soothing"
15180,SECT. II.,"power which most helps to recommend them. Besides the fact, however,"
15181,SECT. II.,"that we have wants which the Greeks had not, this subject may be"
15182,SECT. II.,regarded in a broader view.
15183,SECT. II.,
15184,SECT. II.,The mind of Homer and the mind of his age were not addicted even to
15185,SECT. II.,"contemplation, far less to introspection. Of ideas properly subjective"
15186,SECT. II.,there are very few indeed to be found in the poems. We have one such
15187,SECT. II.,"furnished by the passage where he equates thought to a wing, in a"
15188,SECT. II.,"simile for the swift ships of the Phæacians,"
15189,SECT. II.,
15190,SECT. II.,ὡσεὶ πτέρον ἠὲ νόημα.
15191,SECT. II.,
15192,SECT. II.,"And another, the most remarkable that he supplies, when in more detail"
15193,SECT. II.,he uses the motion of a thought for an illustration of the rapid flight
15194,SECT. II.,of Juno[784].
15195,SECT. II.,
15196,SECT. II.,[784] Il. xv. 80.
15197,SECT. II.,
15198,SECT. II.,"Even when it became speculative, the Greek mind did not give a"
15199,SECT. II.,subjective turn to its speculations. It was probably Christianity
15200,SECT. II.,"which, by the stimulus it applied to the general conscience, first gave"
15201,SECT. II.,mankind the introspective habit on a large scale; and mixed causes
15202,SECT. II.,may often render the tendency excessive and morbid. But the tendency
15203,SECT. II.,"of the heroic age, standing at its maximum in Homer, was to pour life"
15204,SECT. II.,"outward, nay almost to force it into every thing. The fountain from"
15205,SECT. II.,within overflowed; and its surplus went to make inanimate nature
15206,SECT. II.,breathe. The profuse and easy fertility of Homer in simile surely of
15207,SECT. II.,itself demonstrates a wonderful observation and appreciation of nature;
15208,SECT. II.,"but, as has been remarked, these similes are very rarely indeed _still_"
15209,SECT. II.,"similes. They delight in sound, in multitude, above all in motion."
15210,SECT. II.,"The automatic chairs of Vulcan, the living theatre of the Shield of"
15211,SECT. II.,"Achilles, that oldest mirror of our world, the bounding armour of the"
15212,SECT. II.,"same hero, what are all these but the proofs of that redundant energy"
15213,SECT. II.,"of life, whose first resistless impulse it was to carry the vital fire"
15214,SECT. II.,"of Prometheus into every object that it encountered, and which, not yet"
15215,SECT. II.,"having felt the palsying touch of exhaustion, lay under no necessity of"
15216,SECT. II.,"curative provisions for repose? Therefore, while admitting the defect"
15217,SECT. II.,"of Homer with respect to colour, and admitting also that landscape (if"
15218,SECT. II.,we are to understand by it the elaborate combination of natural objects
15219,SECT. II.,reaching over considerable distances) is a great addition to the
15220,SECT. II.,"enjoyment and wealth of mankind, I think the capital explanation of the"
15221,SECT. II.,"question raised is to be found, not in the want of any space, or of any"
15222,SECT. II.,"faculty, in the mind of Homer, but in the fact that the space and the"
15223,SECT. II.,faculties were all occupied with more active and vivifying functions;
15224,SECT. II.,"that the beautiful forms in nature, which we see as beautiful forms"
15225,SECT. II.,"only, were to him the hem of the garments, as it were, of that life"
15226,SECT. II.,"with which all nature teemed. Accordingly, the general rule of the"
15227,SECT. II.,"poems is, that where we should be passive, he is active; that which we"
15228,SECT. II.,"think it much to contemplate with satisfaction, he is ever at work,"
15229,SECT. II.,"with a bolder energy and a keener pleasure, to vivify. We deal with"
15230,SECT. II.,"external nature, as it were unrifled; he saw in it only the residue"
15231,SECT. II.,"which remained to it, after it had at every point thrown off its cream"
15232,SECT. II.,in supernatural formations. His uplifting and vitalizing process is
15233,SECT. II.,everywhere at work. Animate nature is raised even to divinity; and
15234,SECT. II.,inanimate nature is borne upward into life.
15235,SECT. II.,
15236,SECT. II.,"If, then, Homer sees less in the mere sensible forms of natural objects"
15237,SECT. II.,"than we do, it probably is in a great degree because the genius of his"
15238,SECT. II.,"people and his own genius had taught him to invest them with a soul,"
15239,SECT. II.,which drew up into itself the best of their attractions. Mr. Ruskin
15240,SECT. II.,"most justly tells us, with reference to the sea, that he cuts off"
15241,SECT. II.,"from the material object the sense of something living, and fashions"
15242,SECT. II.,"it into a great abstract image of a sea-power[785]. Yet it is not, I"
15243,SECT. II.,"think, quite true, that the Poet leaves in the watery mass no element"
15244,SECT. II.,"of life. On the contrary, I should say the key to his whole treatment"
15245,SECT. II.,of external nature is to be found in this one proposition: wheresoever
15246,SECT. II.,"we look for figure, he looks for life. His waves (as well as his fire)"
15247,SECT. II.,"when they are stirred[786], shout, in the very word (ἰάχειν) that"
15248,SECT. II.,"he gives to the Assembly of Achæans: when they break in foam, they"
15249,SECT. II.,put on the plume of the warrior’s helmet[787] (κορύσσεσθαι): when
15250,SECT. II.,"their lord drives over them, they open wide for joy[788]: and when he"
15251,SECT. II.,"strides upon the field of battle, they, too, boil upon the shore, in an"
15252,SECT. II.,irrepressible sympathy with his effort and emotion[789].

15268,SECT. III.,
15269,SECT. III.,While the faculties of Homer were in many respects both intense and
15270,SECT. III.,"refined in their action, beyond all ordinary, perhaps we might say"
15271,SECT. III.,"beyond all modern, examples, there were other points in which they"
15272,SECT. III.,bear the marks of having been less developed than is now common even
15273,SECT. III.,among the mass of many civilized nations. In the power of abstraction
15274,SECT. III.,"and distinct introspective contemplation, it is not improbable that he"
15275,SECT. III.,was inferior to the generality of educated men in the present day. In
15276,SECT. III.,"some other lower faculties, he is probably excelled by the majority"
15277,SECT. III.,"of the population of this country, nay even by many of the children"
15278,SECT. III.,"in its schools. I venture to specify, as examples of the last-named"
15279,SECT. III.,"proposition, the faculties of number, and of colour. It may be true of"
15280,SECT. III.,"one or both of these, that a certain indistinctness in the perception"
15281,SECT. III.,of them is incidental everywhere to the early stages of society. But
15282,SECT. III.,"yet it is surprising to find it where, as with Homer, it accompanies a"
15283,SECT. III.,"remarkable quickness and maturity not only of great mental powers, but"
15284,SECT. III.,"of certain other perceptions more akin to number and colour, such as"
15285,SECT. III.,"those of motion, of sound, and of form. But let us proceed to examine,"
15286,SECT. III.,"in the first place, the former of these two subjects."
15287,SECT. III.,
15288,SECT. III.,"It may be observed at the outset, that probably none of us are aware"
15289,SECT. III.,to how great an extent our aptitudes with respect to these matters are
15290,SECT. III.,"traditionary, and dependent therefore not upon ourselves, but upon"
15291,SECT. III.,"the acquisitions made by the human race before our birth, and upon"
15292,SECT. III.,"the degree in which those acquisitions have circulated, and have been"
15293,SECT. III.,"as it were filtered through and through the community, so as to take"
15294,SECT. III.,"their place among the elementary ideas, impressions, and habits of"
15295,SECT. III.,"the population. For such parts of human knowledge, as have attained"
15296,SECT. III.,"to this position, are usually gained by each successive generation"
15297,SECT. III.,"through the medium of that insensible training, which begins from the"
15298,SECT. III.,"very earliest infancy, and which precedes by a great interval all the"
15299,SECT. III.,"systematic, and even all the conscious, processes of education. Nor am"
15300,SECT. III.,I for one prepared by any means to deny that there may be an actual
15301,SECT. III.,"‘traducianism’ in the case: on the contrary, in full consistency with"
15302,SECT. III.,"the teaching of experience, we may believe that the acquired aptitudes"
15303,SECT. III.,"of one generation may become, in a greater or a less degree, the"
15304,SECT. III.,inherited and inborn aptitudes of another.
15305,SECT. III.,
15306,SECT. III.,"We must, therefore, reckon upon finding a set of marked differences in"
15307,SECT. III.,the relative degrees of advancement among different human faculties in
15308,SECT. III.,"different stages of society, which shall be simply referable to the"
15309,SECT. III.,"source now pointed out, and distinct altogether from such variations"
15310,SECT. III.,as are referable to other causes. It is not difficult to admit this to
15311,SECT. III.,"be true in general: but the question, whether in the case before us"
15312,SECT. III.,"it applies to number and colour, can of course only be decided by an"
15313,SECT. III.,examination of the Homeric text.
15314,SECT. III.,
15315,SECT. III.,"Yet, before we enter upon this examination, let us endeavour to throw"
15316,SECT. III.,"some further light upon the general aspect of the proposition, which"
15317,SECT. III.,has just been laid down.
15318,SECT. III.,
15319,SECT. III.,"Of all visible things, colour is to our English eye the most striking."
15320,SECT. III.,"Of all ideas, as conceived by the English mind, number appears to be"
15321,SECT. III.,"the most rigidly definite, so that we adopt it as a standard for"
15322,SECT. III.,reducing all other things to definiteness; as when we say that this
15323,SECT. III.,"field or this house is five, ten, or twenty times as large as that."
15324,SECT. III.,"Our merchants, and even our schoolchildren, are good calculators. So"
15325,SECT. III.,"that there is a sense of something strikingly paradoxical, to us in"
15326,SECT. III.,"particular, when we speak of Homer as having had only indeterminate"
15327,SECT. III.,ideas of these subjects.
15328,SECT. III.,
15329,SECT. III.,~_Conceptions of Number not always definite._~
15330,SECT. III.,
15331,SECT. III.,"There are however two practical instances, which may be cited to"
15332,SECT. III.,"illustrate the position, that number is not a thing to be as matter"
15333,SECT. III.,of course definitely conceived in the mind. One of these is the case
15334,SECT. III.,of very young children. To them the very lowest numbers are soon
15335,SECT. III.,"intelligible, but all beyond the lowest are not so, and only present"
15336,SECT. III.,"a vague sense of multitude, that cannot be severed into its component"
15337,SECT. III.,"parts. The distinctive mark of a clear arithmetical conception is, that"
15338,SECT. III.,"the mind at one and the same time embraces the two ideas, first of the"
15339,SECT. III.,"aggregate, secondly of each one of the units which make it up. This"
15340,SECT. III.,"double operation of the brain becomes more arduous, as we ascend higher"
15341,SECT. III.,"in the scale. I have heard a child, put to count beads or something of"
15342,SECT. III.,"the sort, reckon them thus: ‘One, two, three, four, a hundred.’ The"
15343,SECT. III.,"first words express his ideas, the last one his despair. Up to four,"
15344,SECT. III.,"his mind could contain the joint ideas of unity and of severalty, but"
15345,SECT. III.,"not beyond; so he then passed to an expression wholly general, and"
15346,SECT. III.,meant to express a sense like that of the word multitude.
15347,SECT. III.,
15348,SECT. III.,But though the transition from number definitely conceived to number
15349,SECT. III.,"without bounds is like launching into a sea, yet the conception of"
15350,SECT. III.,multitude itself is in one sense susceptible of degree. We may have
15351,SECT. III.,"the idea of a limited, or of an unbounded, multitude. The essential"
15352,SECT. III.,"distinction of the first is, that it might possibly be counted;"
15353,SECT. III.,"the notion of the second is, that it is wholly beyond the power of"
15354,SECT. III.,"numeration to overtake. Probably even the child, to whom the word"
15355,SECT. III.,"‘hundred’ expressed an indefinite idea, would have been faintly"
15356,SECT. III.,"sensible of a difference in degree between ‘hundred’ and ‘million,’"
15357,SECT. III.,and would have known that the latter expressed something larger
15358,SECT. III.,than the former. The circumscribing outline of the idea apprehended
15359,SECT. III.,"is loose, but still there is such an outline. The clearness of the"
15360,SECT. III.,"double conception is indeed effaced; the whole only, and not the whole"
15361,SECT. III.,"together with each part, is contemplated by the mind; but still there"
15362,SECT. III.,"is a certain clouded sense of a real difference in magnitude, as"
15363,SECT. III.,between one such whole and another.
15364,SECT. III.,
15365,SECT. III.,"And this leads me to the second of the two illustrations, to which"
15366,SECT. III.,reference has been made. That loss of definiteness in the conception of
15367,SECT. III.,"number, which the child in our day suffers before he has counted over"
15368,SECT. III.,"his fingers, the grown man suffers also, though at a point commonly"
15369,SECT. III.,"much higher in the scale. What point that may be, depends very much"
15370,SECT. III.,upon the particular habits and aptitudes of the individual. A student
15371,SECT. III.,"in a library of a thousand volumes, an officer before his regiment of a"
15372,SECT. III.,"thousand men upon parade, may have a pretty clear idea of the units as"
15373,SECT. III.,"well as of the totals; but when we come to a thousand times a thousand,"
15374,SECT. III.,"or a thousand times a million, all view of the units, for most men,"
15375,SECT. III.,"probably for every man, is lost: the million for the grown man is in"
15376,SECT. III.,a great degree like the hundred for the child. The numerical term has
15377,SECT. III.,now become essentially a symbol; not only as every word is by its
15378,SECT. III.,"essence a symbol in reference to the idea it immediately denotes; but,"
15379,SECT. III.,"in a further sense, it is a symbol of a symbol, for that idea which"
15380,SECT. III.,"it denotes, is itself symbolical: it is a conventional representation"
15381,SECT. III.,"of a certain vast number of units, far too great to be individually"
15382,SECT. III.,"contemplated and apprehended. As we rise higher still from millions,"
15383,SECT. III.,"say for example, into the class of billions, the vagueness increases."
15384,SECT. III.,"The million is now become a sort of new unit, and the relation of two"
15385,SECT. III.,"millions to one million, is thus pretty clearly apprehended as being"
15386,SECT. III.,"double; but this too becomes obscured as we mount, and even (for"
15387,SECT. III.,"example) the relation of quantity between ten billions of wheat-corns,"
15388,SECT. III.,"and an hundred billions of the same, is far less determinately conveyed"
15389,SECT. III.,"to the mind, than the relation between ten wheat-corns and one. At this"
15390,SECT. III.,"high level, the nouns of number approximate to the indefinite character"
15391,SECT. III.,of the class of algebraic symbols called known quantities.
15392,SECT. III.,
15393,SECT. III.,"In proportion as our conception of numbers is definite, the idea of"
15394,SECT. III.,"them, instead of being suited for an address to the imagination,"
15395,SECT. III.,"remains unsuited for poetic handling, and thrives within the sphere"
15396,SECT. III.,of the understanding only. But when we pass beyond the scale of
15397,SECT. III.,"determinate into that of practically indeterminate amounts, then the"
15398,SECT. III.,"use of numbers becomes highly poetical. I would quote, as a very noble"
15399,SECT. III.,"example of this use of number, a verse in the Revelations of St. John."
15400,SECT. III.,"‘And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the"
15401,SECT. III.,"throne, and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten"
15402,SECT. III.,"thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands[790].’ As a"
15403,SECT. III.,"proof of the power of this fine passage, I would observe, that the"
15404,SECT. III.,"descent from ten thousand times ten thousand to thousands of thousands,"
15405,SECT. III.,"though it is in fact numerically very great, has none of the chilling"
15406,SECT. III.,"effect of anticlimax, because these numbers are not arithmetically"
15407,SECT. III.,"conceived, and the last member of the sentence is simply, so to speak,"
15408,SECT. III.,the trail of light which the former draws behind it.
15409,SECT. III.,
15410,SECT. III.,[790] Rev. v. 11.
15411,SECT. III.,
15412,SECT. III.,"Now we must keep clearly before our minds the idea, that this poetical"
15413,SECT. III.,and figurative use of number among the Greeks at least preceded what
15414,SECT. III.,I may call its calculative use. We shall find in Homer nothing that
15415,SECT. III.,can strictly be called calculation. He repeatedly gives us what may
15416,SECT. III.,be termed the factors of a sum in multiplication; but he never even
15417,SECT. III.,"partially combines them, even as they are combined for example in"
15418,SECT. III.,"Cowper’s ballad,"
15419,SECT. III.,
15420,SECT. III.,"John Gilpin’s spouse said to her dear,"
15421,SECT. III.,Though wedded we have been
15422,SECT. III.,"These _twice ten_ tedious years, yet we"
15423,SECT. III.,No holiday have seen.
15424,SECT. III.,
15425,SECT. III.,Reference has been made to the convenience which we find in using
15426,SECT. III.,"number as a measure of quantity, and as a means of comparing things"
15427,SECT. III.,of every species in their own kind. But we never meet with this use
15428,SECT. III.,of it in Homer. He has not even the words necessary to enable him to
15429,SECT. III.,"say, ‘This house is five times as large as that.’ If he had the idea"
15430,SECT. III.,"to express, he would say, Five houses, each as large as that, would"
15431,SECT. III.,hardly be equal to this. The word τρὶς may be called an adverb of
15432,SECT. III.,"multiplication; but it is never used for these comparisons. Indeed,"
15433,SECT. III.,"Damm observes, that in a large majority of instances it signifies an"
15434,SECT. III.,"indefinite number, not a precise one. Τετράκις is found only once, and"
15435,SECT. III.,in a sense wholly indeterminate: the passage is[791] τρισμάκαρες Δαναοὶ
15436,SECT. III.,"καὶ τετράκις. Πεντάκις does not even exist. Ajax lifts a stone, not"
15437,SECT. III.,"‘twice as large as a mortal of to-day could raise’, but so large that"
15438,SECT. III.,it would require two such mortals to raise it. All Homer’s numerical
15439,SECT. III.,"expressions are in the most elementary forms; such forms, as are"
15440,SECT. III.,"without composition, and refuse all further analysis."

15444,SECT. III.,~_Greek estimate of the discovery of Number._~
15445,SECT. III.,
15446,SECT. III.,His use of number appears to have been confined to simple addition: and
15447,SECT. III.,"it is probable that all the higher numbers which we find in the poems,"
15448,SECT. III.,were figurative and most vaguely conceived. If we are able to make
15449,SECT. III.,"good the proof of these propositions from the Homeric text, we shall"
15450,SECT. III.,"then be well able to understand the manner in which Numeration, or"
15451,SECT. III.,"the science of number, is spoken of by the Greeks of the historic age"
15452,SECT. III.,"as a marvellous invention. It appears in Æschylus, as among the very"
15453,SECT. III.,greatest of the discoveries of Prometheus[792]:

15463,SECT. III.,
15464,SECT. III.,So that the use of numbers by rule was to the Greek mind as much a
15465,SECT. III.,"discovery as the letters of the alphabet, and is even described here"
15466,SECT. III.,as a greater one: much as in later times men have viewed the use of
15467,SECT. III.,"logarithms, or of the method of fluxions or the calculus. In full"
15468,SECT. III.,"conformity with this are the superlative terms, in which Plato speaks"
15469,SECT. III.,"of number. Number, in fact, seems to be exhibited in great part of the"
15470,SECT. III.,"Greek philosophy, as if it had actually been the guide of the human"
15471,SECT. III.,mind in its progress towards realizing all the great and cardinal ideas
15472,SECT. III.,"of order, measure, proportion, and relation."
15473,SECT. III.,
15474,SECT. III.,"Up to what point human intelligence, in the time of Homer, was able to"
15475,SECT. III.,"push the process of simple addition, we do not precisely know. It is"
15476,SECT. III.,"not, however, hastily to be assumed that, in any one of his faculties,"
15477,SECT. III.,"Homer was behind his age; and it is safer to believe that the poems,"
15478,SECT. III.,"even in these points, represent it advantageously. Now, in one place"
15479,SECT. III.,"at least, we have a primitive account of a process of addition. The"
15480,SECT. III.,"passage is in the Fourth Odyssey, where Menelaus relates, how Proteus"
15481,SECT. III.,counted upon his fingers the number of his seals[793]. That it was
15482,SECT. III.,"a certain particular number is obvious, because when four of them"
15483,SECT. III.,"had been killed by Eidothee, their skins were put upon Menelaus and"
15484,SECT. III.,"his three comrades, and the four Greeks were then counted into the"
15485,SECT. III.,"herd, so that the word ἀριθμὸς here evidently means a definite total."
15486,SECT. III.,"This addition by Proteus, however, was not addition in the proper"
15487,SECT. III.,"arithmetical sense, and would be more properly called enumeration: it"
15488,SECT. III.,"was probably effected simply by adding each unit singly, in succession,"
15489,SECT. III.,"to the others, with the aid of the fingers, (proved through the word"
15490,SECT. III.,"πεμπάσσεται,) but not by the aid of any scale or combination of units,"
15491,SECT. III.,"either decimal or quinal. In the word δεκὰς we have, indeed, the first"
15492,SECT. III.,step towards a decimal scale; but we have not even that in the case
15493,SECT. III.,"of the number five, there being no πεντὰς or πεμπτάς. The meaning of"
15494,SECT. III.,"πεμπάσσεται evidently is, not that he arranged the numeration in fives,"
15495,SECT. III.,"but that, by means of the fingers of one hand, employed upon those of"
15496,SECT. III.,"the other, he assisted the process of simple enumeration."
15497,SECT. III.,
15498,SECT. III.,"[793] Od. iv. 412, 451."
15499,SECT. III.,
15500,SECT. III.,~_Highest numerals of the poems._~
15501,SECT. III.,
15502,SECT. III.,Homer’s highest numeral is μύριοι. He describes the Myrmidons as being
15503,SECT. III.,"μύριοι[794], though, if we assume a mean strength of about eighty-five"
15504,SECT. III.,"for their crews, the force would but little have exceeded four"
15505,SECT. III.,"thousand: and at the _maximum_ of one hundred and twenty for each ship,"
15506,SECT. III.,"it would only come to six thousand. Again, Homer uses the expression"
15507,SECT. III.,"μύρια ᾔδη, to denote a person of instructed and accomplished mind[795]."
15508,SECT. III.,
15509,SECT. III.,[794] Il. xxiii. 29.
15510,SECT. III.,
15511,SECT. III.,[795] Od. ii. 16.
15512,SECT. III.,
15513,SECT. III.,"Next to the μύρια, the highest numerals employed in the poems are"
15514,SECT. III.,those contained in the passage where the Poet says that the howl of
15515,SECT. III.,"Mars, on being wounded by Diomed, was as loud as the shout of an army"
15516,SECT. III.,of nine thousand or ten thousand men[796]:
15517,SECT. III.,

15522,SECT. III.,
15523,SECT. III.,But it is clear that the expressions are purely poetical and
15524,SECT. III.,figurative. For he never comes near the use of such high numbers
15525,SECT. III.,"elsewhere; and yet it obviously lay in his path to use these, and"
15526,SECT. III.,"higher numbers still, when he was describing the strength of the Greek"
15527,SECT. III.,and Trojan armies.
15528,SECT. III.,
15529,SECT. III.,"The highest Homeric number, after those which have been named, is"
15530,SECT. III.,found in the three thousand horses of Erichthonius. This we must also
15531,SECT. III.,"consider poetical, because it is so far beyond the ordinary range"
15532,SECT. III.,"of the poems, and in some degree likewise because of the obvious"
15533,SECT. III.,unlikelihood of his having possessed that particular number of
15534,SECT. III.,mares[797].
15535,SECT. III.,
15536,SECT. III.,[797] Il. xxi. 251.
15537,SECT. III.,
15538,SECT. III.,"Only thrice, besides the instances already quoted, does Homer use the"
15539,SECT. III.,fourth power of numbers; it is in the case of the single thousand. A
15540,SECT. III.,thousand measures of wine were sent by Euneos as a present to Agamemnon
15541,SECT. III.,and Menelaus. A thousand watch-fires were kindled by the Trojans on the
15542,SECT. III.,"plain. Iphidamas, having given an hundred oxen in order to obtain his"
15543,SECT. III.,"wife, then promised a thousand goats and sheep out of his countless"
15544,SECT. III.,"herds[798]. In all these three cases, it is more than doubtful whether"
15545,SECT. III.,the word thousand is not roughly and loosely used as a round number.
15546,SECT. III.,"The combination of the thousand sheep and goats with the hundred oxen,"
15547,SECT. III.,"immediately awakens the recollection that even the Homeric hecatomb,"
15548,SECT. III.,"though meaning etymologically an hundred oxen, practically meant"
15549,SECT. III.,"nothing of the kind, but only what we should call a lot or batch of"
15550,SECT. III.,"oxen. Again, it is so obviously improbable that the Trojans should"
15551,SECT. III.,"in an hurried bivouac have lighted just a thousand fires, and placed"
15552,SECT. III.,"just fifty men by each, that we may take this passage as plainly"
15553,SECT. III.,"figurative, and as conveying no more than a very rude approximation, of"
15554,SECT. III.,such a kind as would be inadmissible where the practice of calculation
15555,SECT. III.,"is familiar. It is then most likely, that in the remaining one of"
15556,SECT. III.,"the three passages, the Poet means only to convey that a large and"
15557,SECT. III.,"liberal present of wine was sent by Euneus, as the consideration for"
15558,SECT. III.,his being allowed to trade with the army. There is certainly more of
15559,SECT. III.,"approximation to a definite use of the single thousand, than of the"
15560,SECT. III.,"three, the nine, or the ten: but this difference in definiteness is"
15561,SECT. III.,in reality a main point in the evidence. Most of all does this become
15562,SECT. III.,"palpable, when we consider how strange is in itself the omission to"
15563,SECT. III.,state the numbers of the combatants on either side of this great
15564,SECT. III.,"struggle: an omission so strange, of what would be to ourselves a fact"
15565,SECT. III.,"of such elementary and primary interest, that we can hardly account for"
15566,SECT. III.,"it otherwise than by the admission, that to the Greeks of the Homeric"
15567,SECT. III.,"age the totals of the armies, even if the Poet himself could have"
15568,SECT. III.,"reckoned them, would have been unintelligible."

15574,SECT. III.,and sixty fat hogs under the care of Eumæus in Ithaca[799];

15579,SECT. III.,
15580,SECT. III.,The reason for considering this number as having a pretty definite sense
15581,SECT. III.,"in the Poet’s mind (quite a different matter, let it be borne in mind,"
15582,SECT. III.,from the question whether the circumstance is meant to be taken as
15583,SECT. III.,"historical) is, that it stands in evident association with the number"
15584,SECT. III.,"of days, as it was probably then reckoned, in the year. It seems plain"
15585,SECT. III.,"that he meant to describe the whole circle of the year, where he says,"
15586,SECT. III.,"that for each of the days and nights which Jupiter has given, or, in"
15587,SECT. III.,"his own words[800],"

15593,SECT. III.,"the greedy Suitors are not contented with the slaughter of one animal,"
15594,SECT. III.,or even of two. Eumæus then gives an account of the wealth of Ulysses
15595,SECT. III.,"in live stock, both within the isle and on the mainland, from whence"
15596,SECT. III.,"the animals were supplied: and adds, that from the Ithacan store a"
15597,SECT. III.,"goatherd took down daily a fat goat, while he himself as often sent"
15598,SECT. III.,down a fat hog. I have dwelt thus particularly on the detail of this
15599,SECT. III.,"case, because it may fairly be inferred from the correspondence between"
15600,SECT. III.,"the number of the hogs and the days of the year, that for once, at all"
15601,SECT. III.,"events, the Poet intended to speak, though somewhat at random, yet in"
15602,SECT. III.,"a degree arithmetically, and that of so high a number as 360."
15603,SECT. III.,
15604,SECT. III.,"There are other cases of lower numbers in different parts of the poems,"
15605,SECT. III.,"where it may be argued, with varying measures of probability, that"
15606,SECT. III.,Homer had a similar intention.

15608,SECT. III.,~_The ἑκατομβὴ and numerals of value._~
15609,SECT. III.,
15610,SECT. III.,"The word ἑκατομβὴ, without doubt, affords a striking proof of vagueness"
15611,SECT. III.,in the ideas of the heroic age with respect to number: and this
15612,SECT. III.,"vagueness extends, yet apparently in varying degrees, to the adjective"
15613,SECT. III.,ἑκατομβοῖος. I have elsewhere[801] referred to adjectives of this
15614,SECT. III.,"formation as indicative of the fact, that for those generations of"
15615,SECT. III.,mankind oxen may be said to have constituted a measure of value; and
15616,SECT. III.,"this fact certainly involves an aim at numerical exactitude. It seems,"
15617,SECT. III.,"indeed, on general grounds far from improbable, that the business of"
15618,SECT. III.,"exchange may have been the original guide of our race into the art, and"
15619,SECT. III.,"thus into the science, of arithmetic."
15620,SECT. III.,
15621,SECT. III.,"[801] Agorè, p. 82."
15622,SECT. III.,
15623,SECT. III.,"In the description of the Shield of Minerva, which had an hundred"
15624,SECT. III.,"golden drops or tassels, we are told that each of them was ἑκατομβοῖος,"
15625,SECT. III.,or worth an hundred oxen. This use of the word must be regarded as
15626,SECT. III.,strongly charged with figure. Minerva was arming to mingle among men
15627,SECT. III.,"upon the plain of Troy[802], and it is not likely, therefore, that"
15628,SECT. III.,the Poet would represent her in dimensions utterly inordinate. He
15629,SECT. III.,judiciously reserves this license of exaggeration without bounds for
15630,SECT. III.,"scenes where he is beyond the sphere of relations properly human, as"
15631,SECT. III.,"for example, the Theomachy and the Under-world. Now we may venture"
15632,SECT. III.,to take the Homeric value of an ox before Troy at half an ounce of
15633,SECT. III.,"gold. In the prizes of the wrestling match, where a tripod was worth"
15634,SECT. III.,"twelve oxen, a highly skilled woman (πολλὰ δ’ ἐπίστατο ἔργα) was worth"
15635,SECT. III.,four[803]. Two ounces of gold would be a low price for such a person in
15636,SECT. III.,"almost any age. According to this computation, each drop on the Ægis of"
15637,SECT. III.,Minerva would weigh fifty ounces: the whole would weigh above 300 lbs.
15638,SECT. III.,"_avoirdupois_, and if we were to assume the purely ornamental fringe"
15639,SECT. III.,"in a work of this kind to weigh one tenth part of the whole, the Ægis"
15640,SECT. III.,"itself would weigh nearly a ton and a half. _Primâ facie_, this is"
15641,SECT. III.,"susceptible of explanation in either of two ways: the one, that the"
15642,SECT. III.,"numbers are used poetically and not arithmetically; the other, that of"
15643,SECT. III.,"sheer intentional exaggeration in bulk. The rules of the Poet, as they"
15644,SECT. III.,"are elsewhere applied, oblige us to reject the latter solution, and"
15645,SECT. III.,consequently throw us back upon the former.

15660,SECT. III.,
15661,SECT. III.,Here there seems to be a mixture of the metaphorical and the
15662,SECT. III.,"arithmetical use. For, on the one hand, it is singular that he should"
15663,SECT. III.,have chosen numbers which require the aid of a fraction to express
15664,SECT. III.,their relation to one another. He could certainly not have meant to say
15665,SECT. III.,"that the values of the two suits were precisely as 100:9, or as 11⅑:1."
15666,SECT. III.,"And yet, on the one hand, he could scarcely use the term ἐννεαβοῖα,"
15667,SECT. III.,"except with reference to the known and usual value of a suit of armour,"
15668,SECT. III.,"while the ἑκατομβοῖα, from its use in other places, must be suspected"
15669,SECT. III.,of having no more than a merely indeterminate force.
15670,SECT. III.,
15671,SECT. III.,"With this fractional relation of 100:9, may be compared the arrangement"
15672,SECT. III.,"at the feast in Pylos, where each division of five hundred persons"
15673,SECT. III.,"was supplied with nine oxen. These numbers, however, are probably"
15674,SECT. III.,"less vague than in some other cases: for the provision stated, though"

15681,SECT. III.,of the figurative use of number. Had the young prince been ransomed
15682,SECT. III.,"by Priam, a great price, no doubt, would have been given. But Achilles"
15683,SECT. III.,"sold him into Lemnos, ἄνευθεν ἄγων πατρός τε φίλων τε: and to the"
15684,SECT. III.,"Lemnians he could hardly have value but as a labourer, although indeed"
15685,SECT. III.,"it chanced that he was afterwards redeemed, by a ξεῖνος of Priam[806],"
15686,SECT. III.,"at a high price. We cannot, then, suppose that he had brought any such"
15687,SECT. III.,return as would be represented by a full hundred of oxen.

15693,SECT. III.,"The evidence thus far, I think, tends powerfully to support the"
15694,SECT. III.,"hypothesis, that there is an amount of vagueness in Homer’s general"
15695,SECT. III.,"use of numbers, unless indeed as to very low ones, which cannot be"
15696,SECT. III.,explained otherwise than as metaphorical or purely poetical: and that
15697,SECT. III.,"his mind never had before it any of those processes, simple as they are"
15698,SECT. III.,"to all who are familiar with them, of multiplication, subtraction, or"
15699,SECT. III.,division.
15700,SECT. III.,
15701,SECT. III.,"I admit it to be possible, that his manner of treating number may have"
15702,SECT. III.,"been owing to his determination to be intelligible, and to the state of"
15703,SECT. III.,"the faculties of his hearers, as much as, or even more than, his own."
15704,SECT. III.,But to me the supposition of the infant condition even of his faculties
15705,SECT. III.,"with respect to number, though at first sight startling, approves"
15706,SECT. III.,itself on reflection as one thoroughly in conformity with analogy and
15707,SECT. III.,nature. Indeed the experience of life may convince us that to this
15708,SECT. III.,"hour we should be mistaken, if we supposed arithmetical conceptions"
15709,SECT. III.,to be uniform in different minds; that the relations of number are
15710,SECT. III.,"faintly and imperfectly apprehended, except by either practised or else"
15711,SECT. III.,"peculiarly gifted persons; and that, in short, there is nothing more"
15712,SECT. III.,mysterious than arithmetic to those who do not understand it. As one
15713,SECT. III.,"illustration of this opinion, I will cite the difficulty which most"
15714,SECT. III.,"educated persons, when studying history, certainly feel in mastering"
15715,SECT. III.,its chronology; while to those who are apt at figures it is not only
15716,SECT. III.,"acquired with ease, but it even serves as the _nexus_ and support of"
15717,SECT. III.,the whole chain of events.
15718,SECT. III.,
15719,SECT. III.,"There were several occasions, upon which it would have been most"
15720,SECT. III.,natural and appropriate for Homer to use the faculty of multiplication;
15721,SECT. III.,yet on no one of these has he used it. He constantly supplies us with

15724,SECT. III.,~_Silence as to the numbers of the armies._~
15725,SECT. III.,
15726,SECT. III.,The first example in the Iliad is supplied by that passage of the
15727,SECT. III.,"unhappy speech of Agamemnon to the Assembly in the Second Book, which"
15728,SECT. III.,causes the fever-fit of home-sickness. He compares the strength of
15729,SECT. III.,the Greek army with that of the Trojans; and he only effects the
15730,SECT. III.,purpose by this feeble but elaborate contrivance. ‘Should the Greeks
15731,SECT. III.,"and Trojans agree to be numbered respectively, and should the Trojans"
15732,SECT. III.,"properly so called be placed one by one, but the Greeks in tens, and"
15733,SECT. III.,"every Trojan made cupbearer to a Greek ten, many of our tens would be"
15734,SECT. III.,"without a cupbearer[807].’ In the first place, the fact that he calls"
15735,SECT. III.,this ascertaining of comparative force numbering ἀριθμηθημέναι is
15736,SECT. III.,remarkable; for it would not have shown the numbers of either army; nor
15737,SECT. III.,"even the difference, by which the Greeks exceeded a tenfold ratio to"
15738,SECT. III.,"the Trojans; but simply, by leaving an unexhausted residue, the fact"
15739,SECT. III.,"that they were more, whether by much or by little, than ten times as"
15740,SECT. III.,"many as the besieged. Secondly, it seems plain that, if Homer had known"
15741,SECT. III.,"what was meant by multiplication, he would have used the process in"
15742,SECT. III.,"this instance, in lieu of the elaborate (yet poetical) circumlocution"
15743,SECT. III.,"which he has adopted; and would have said the Greeks were ten times,"
15744,SECT. III.,"or fifteen times, or twenty times, as many as the inhabitants of Troy."

15748,SECT. III.,"After this, Ulysses reminds the Assembly of the apparition of the"
15749,SECT. III.,"dragon they had seen at Aulis. The phrase χθιζά τε καὶ πρώιζα, which he"
15750,SECT. III.,"employs, may grammatically either belong to the epoch of the gathering"
15751,SECT. III.,"at Aulis, or to the time of the plague, which had carried off a part of"
15752,SECT. III.,the force a fortnight or three weeks before. In whichever connection of
15753,SECT. III.,"the two we place it, it affords an instance of extreme indefiniteness"
15754,SECT. III.,in the use of two adverbs which are at once expressive of time and
15755,SECT. III.,of number; for on one supposition he must use them to express whole
15756,SECT. III.,"years, and on the other they must mean near a fortnight, and therefore"
15757,SECT. III.,a certain number of days.
15758,SECT. III.,
15759,SECT. III.,The next case is remarkable. It is that of the Catalogue.
15760,SECT. III.,
15761,SECT. III.,"The resolution, which introduces it, was not a resolution to number the"
15762,SECT. III.,host; but simply to make a careful division and distribution of the men
15763,SECT. III.,"under their leaders, with a view to a more effective responsibility,"
15764,SECT. III.,both of officers and men[808]. But when the Poet comes to enumerate the
15765,SECT. III.,"divisions, it is evidently a great object with him to make known the"
15766,SECT. III.,"relative forces, and thus the relative prominence and power, of the"
15767,SECT. III.,different States of Greece. Yet nothing can be more imperfect than the
15768,SECT. III.,manner in which the enumerating portion of his task is executed. In the
15769,SECT. III.,"first place, we trace again the old habit of the loose and figurative"
15770,SECT. III.,use of numbers. For Homer could hardly mean us to take literally all
15771,SECT. III.,"the numbers of ships, which he has stated in the Catalogue: since,"
15772,SECT. III.,"in every case where they come up to or exceed twenty, they run in"
15773,SECT. III.,complete decades without odd numbers; subject to the single exception
15774,SECT. III.,"of the twenty-two ships of Gouneus. Podalirius and Machaon have thirty,"
15775,SECT. III.,"the Phocians forty, Achilles fifty, Menelaus sixty, Diomed eighty,"
15776,SECT. III.,"Nestor ninety, Agamemnon an hundred: the only full multiple of ten"
15777,SECT. III.,"omitted being the utterly intractable ἑβδομήκοντα. But again, he gives"
15778,SECT. III.,us no effectual clue to the numbers of the crews. Each of the fifty
15779,SECT. III.,"ships of the Bœotians had one hundred and twenty men, and each of the"
15780,SECT. III.,seven ships of Philoctetes had fifty[809]. Thus he supplies us with the
15781,SECT. III.,"two factors of the sum, which would find the number of men, in each"
15782,SECT. III.,of these two cases; but in neither case does he perform the sum; and
15783,SECT. III.,such is the uniform practice throughout the poems. For the Greek force
15784,SECT. III.,"generally, he has not even given us the factors. It has indeed been"
15785,SECT. III.,"conjectured, that fifty may have been the smallest ship’s company, and"
15786,SECT. III.,one hundred and twenty the largest: but this is mere conjecture; and
15787,SECT. III.,"even if it be well founded, still we do not know whether the generality"
15788,SECT. III.,"of the ships were about the mean, or nearer one or the other of the"
15789,SECT. III.,"extremes. Again, it would appear probable from the Odyssey, that these"
15790,SECT. III.,"numbers, of fifty and one hundred and twenty, are exclusive at least"
15791,SECT. III.,"of pilots and commanders, if not also of the stewards[810] and the"
15792,SECT. III.,minor officers[811]; for the number mentioned by Alcinous[812] is
15793,SECT. III.,"fifty-two; and although he says that all were to sit down to row, the"
15794,SECT. III.,"texts when compared cannot but suggest, that the number fifty was an"
15795,SECT. III.,"usual complement of oars, and that the two were the captain and pilot"
15796,SECT. III.,respectively[813].

15811,SECT. III.,"of the Greek armament; or Homer could not have said, after giving"
15812,SECT. III.,"Agamemnon an hundred ships, that he had by far the largest force of all"

15819,SECT. III.,
15820,SECT. III.,"For Diomed and Idomeneus have each eighty ships, and Nestor has ninety,"
15821,SECT. III.,"so that their numbers would come very near Agamemnon’s, unless their"
15822,SECT. III.,"ships were smaller. But to sum up this discussion. It is evident that,"
15823,SECT. III.,if only we suppose the Greeks of Homer’s time to have had a definite
15824,SECT. III.,"and well developed sense of number, the mention by Homer of the amount"
15825,SECT. III.,of force in the Trojan expedition would have been a fact of the highest
15826,SECT. III.,"national interest and importance. Yet he has left us nothing, which can"
15827,SECT. III.,"be said even definitely to approximate to a record of it, though the"
15828,SECT. III.,enumeration of the Catalogue appears almost to force the subject upon
15829,SECT. III.,"him. The fair inferences seem to be, that he did not understand the"
15830,SECT. III.,"calculative use of numbers at all, or beyond some very limited range;"
15831,SECT. III.,"and that, even within that range, he for the most part employed them"
15832,SECT. III.,"poetically and ornamentally; they were decorative and effective, like"
15833,SECT. III.,"epithets to his song, but they were not statistical; as expressions of"
15834,SECT. III.,"force they were no more than (as it were) tentative, and that but very"
15835,SECT. III.,rudely.
15836,SECT. III.,
15837,SECT. III.,I am further confirmed in the belief of Homer’s indeterminate
15838,SECT. III.,"conception of number, from the strange result to which the contrary"
15839,SECT. III.,opinion would lead. He tells us of the Trojan bivouac[815];
15840,SECT. III.,
15841,SECT. III.,[815] Il. viii. 562.
15842,SECT. III.,
15843,SECT. III.,χίλι’ ἄρ’ ἐν πεδίῳ πυρὰ καίετο· πὰρ δὲ ἑκάστῳ
15844,SECT. III.,εἵατο πεντήκοντα.
15845,SECT. III.,
15846,SECT. III.,In this case he has given us again the factors of a sum in
15847,SECT. III.,"multiplication, though not the product. Did he mean them to be taken"
15848,SECT. III.,"literally? If he did, then it is indeed strange that, although he says"
15849,SECT. III.,"nothing whatever on the subject of number in the Trojan Catalogue,"
15850,SECT. III.,yet he has here supplied us with all the particulars necessary for
15851,SECT. III.,"estimating the Trojan force, while as to the Greek army, we remain"
15852,SECT. III.,"unable to say whether it amounted to fifty thousand, or to half, or"
15853,SECT. III.,to twice or thrice that number. But it is quite plain from the total
15854,SECT. III.,"absence of specified numbers in the Trojan Catalogue, that he had no"
15855,SECT. III.,"desire, as indeed he had no occasion, to give an accurate account of"
15856,SECT. III.,"the Trojan force. On the other hand it appears, from the details of"
15857,SECT. III.,"the Greek Catalogue, that he did wish to describe the amount of the"
15858,SECT. III.,"force on that side, as far as he could conceive or convey it. If all"
15859,SECT. III.,"this be so, then nothing can show more clearly than the thousand Trojan"
15860,SECT. III.,"watch-fires, with their fifty men at each, Homer’s figurative manner of"
15861,SECT. III.,employing numerical aggregations. If however we admit the figurative
15862,SECT. III.,"use, we at once find everything harmonious. He describes the Trojans by"
15863,SECT. III.,"the method of bold enhancement, at a juncture of the poem where it is"
15864,SECT. III.,his purpose to make them terrible to the Greek imagination.
15865,SECT. III.,
15866,SECT. III.,The instance of Proteus in the Odyssey has already been referred to:
15867,SECT. III.,but one more marked is afforded by the description that Eumæus gives of
15868,SECT. III.,"the herds and flocks of Ulysses. This, again, is one of the instances"
15869,SECT. III.,where the spirit and gist of the passage almost required that a total
15870,SECT. III.,should be stated. For the object is to give a telling account. The
15871,SECT. III.,"wealth of this prince, says the Poet, was boundless; none of the"
15872,SECT. III.,"heroes, whether of Ithaca or of the fertile continent, had so much; no,"
15873,SECT. III.,"nor had any twenty of them. Then he mentions how many herds of cattle,"
15874,SECT. III.,"goats, and swine, and flocks of sheep there were, but gives no numbers"
15875,SECT. III.,"of any of the herds, nor any total: though, shortly before, the poem"
15876,SECT. III.,had mentioned the three hundred and sixty fat hogs under the care of
15877,SECT. III.,"Eumæus, and had also given us the sows in the usual manner, stating"
15878,SECT. III.,that there were twelve sties with fifty in each; but not specifying
15879,SECT. III.,anywhere the total of six hundred which these figures yield when
15880,SECT. III.,multiplied together[816].
15881,SECT. III.,
15882,SECT. III.,[816] Od. xiv. 13-20.
15883,SECT. III.,
15884,SECT. III.,"Again, then the result of all these passages, as well as of more"
15885,SECT. III.,"which might be quoted, is, I think, to show that Homer’s conceptions"
15886,SECT. III.,"of number, and his use of number, especially when beyond a very low"
15887,SECT. III.,"limit, were so indeterminate, that they may not improperly be called"
15888,SECT. III.,figurative.
15889,SECT. III.,
15890,SECT. III.,~_Hesiod’s age of the Nymphs._~
15891,SECT. III.,
15892,SECT. III.,"In support and in illustration of this belief with respect to Homer,"
15893,SECT. III.,I would once more refer to the curious fragment ascribed to Hesiod
15894,SECT. III.,"respecting the age of the Nymphs with beauteous locks, which begins,"
15895,SECT. III.,
15896,SECT. III.,ἐννέα τοι ζώει γενεὰς λακέρυζα κορώνη
15897,SECT. III.,ἀνδρῶν ἡβώντων.
15898,SECT. III.,
15899,SECT. III.,"In the Etymol. Magn. 13. 36, the reading is γερώντων; and Ausonius,"
15900,SECT. III.,"following this authority in his Eighteenth Idyll, makes the γενεὴ no"
15901,SECT. III.,less than 96 years. But the sense of γενεὴ is fixed by Homer’s account
15902,SECT. III.,"of Nestor, and otherwise, in such a way as greatly to favour the"
15903,SECT. III.,reading ἡβώντων. The word therefore means the term between birth and
15904,SECT. III.,"the prime of life, which may well be taken at thirty years. Then comes"
15905,SECT. III.,a table as follows.
15906,SECT. III.,
15907,SECT. III.,The age of the daw = 9 ages of men.
15908,SECT. III.,
15909,SECT. III.,The age of the stag = 4 of daws = 36 of men.
15910,SECT. III.,
15911,SECT. III.,The age of the crow = 3 of stags = twelve of daws = 108 of men.
15912,SECT. III.,
15913,SECT. III.,The age of the palm = 9 of crows = 27 of stags = 108 of daws = 972 of
15914,SECT. III.,men.
15915,SECT. III.,
15916,SECT. III.,The age of the Nymph = 10 of palms = 90 of crows = 270 of stags =
15917,SECT. III.,1080 of daws = 9720 of men.
15918,SECT. III.,
15919,SECT. III.,"And if the γενεὴ be 30 years, the age of the Nymphs = 30 × 9720 ="
15920,SECT. III.,"291,600 years. But the point most remarkable for us is, that while"
15921,SECT. III.,"Hesiod, if Hesiod it be, supplies us with the whole of the first"
15922,SECT. III.,"factors after the γενεὴ, for this long sum, he does not actually"
15923,SECT. III.,"perform one single multiplication; nor does he even define the γενεὴ,"
15924,SECT. III.,which is the first and most vital element of all.
15925,SECT. III.,
15926,SECT. III.,He has thus given us at once a very pretty poetical invention for
15927,SECT. III.,"expressing approximately the age of Nymphs, who are Jove-born indeed,"
15928,SECT. III.,"yet are not immortal, and a remarkable proof of the indefiniteness of"
15929,SECT. III.,"numerical conceptions, and of total unacquaintance with the rules of"
15930,SECT. III.,arithmetic[817].
15931,SECT. III.,
15932,SECT. III.,[817] I subjoin the rest of this curious fragment;

15939,SECT. III.,"It is noticed by Pliny, (Nat. Hist. vii. 48.) who terms it fabulous;"
15940,SECT. III.,"but it is with more propriety, I think, to be called poetical."
15941,SECT. III.,
15942,SECT. III.,One consequence of the proposition I have advanced with respect to
15943,SECT. III.,"Homer is, to destroy altogether a supposed discrepancy between the"
15944,SECT. III.,"Iliad and the Odyssey, which has often been paraded as a reason, among"
15945,SECT. III.,"others, for assigning them to different authors. It is truly alleged"
15946,SECT. III.,"that, in the Catalogue[818], Crete is called ἑκατόμπολις; and that in"
15947,SECT. III.,"the Nineteenth Odyssey[819] we are told of it,"
15948,SECT. III.,
15949,SECT. III.,[818] Il. ii. 649.
15950,SECT. III.,
15951,SECT. III.,[819] Od. xix. 173.
15952,SECT. III.,
15953,SECT. III.,ἐν δ’ ἄνθρωποι
15954,SECT. III.,"πολλοὶ, ἀπειρέσιοι, καὶ ἐννήκοντα πόληες."
15955,SECT. III.,
15956,SECT. III.,"Each of these words appears to be interpreted as strictly, as it"
15957,SECT. III.,would be if caught by an auditor in the accounts of some delinquent
15958,SECT. III.,"Joint-Stock Company; and thus, forsooth, a diversity of authors for"
15959,SECT. III.,"the two poems is to be made good. Now it is not a little odd, if both"
15960,SECT. III.,"these poets looked at the subject with the eye of statisticians, that"
15961,SECT. III.,"while each found a different number of cities in Crete, yet each found"
15962,SECT. III.,"an even, and more or less a round number. But why is ἑκατόμπολις to"
15963,SECT. III.,"be more strictly interpreted than ἑκατομβή? And again, if we are to"
15964,SECT. III.,"construe ἐννήκοντα statistically, what are we to do with the very"
15965,SECT. III.,"word that precedes it, namely, ἀπειρέσιοι? The simple fact of the"
15966,SECT. III.,juxtaposition of that word with the ἐννήκοντα πόληες should surely have
15967,SECT. III.,"sufficed to show, that the whole manner of speech was (what we now"
15968,SECT. III.,"call) poetical. So regarding it, I venture even to say that the effect"
15969,SECT. III.,"of a comparison with the epithet in the Catalogue is to establish, not"
15970,SECT. III.,"a discrepancy in point of fact, but rather a similarity in the measure"
15971,SECT. III.,"of figurative conception and expression: so that in consequence, as far"
15972,SECT. III.,"as it is worth any thing, it rather tends to prove the identity, than"
15973,SECT. III.,"the diversity, of authorship between the two poems."
15974,SECT. III.,
15975,SECT. III.,"A second consequence, which must be drawn from the foregoing"
15976,SECT. III.,"conclusions, is this; that we shall do wrong to search the poems of"
15977,SECT. III.,Homer for any scheme of chronology. The minute enumerations of the
15978,SECT. III.,Mosaic books have perhaps given the tone to our ordinary historical
15979,SECT. III.,"inquiries: but, at least with respect to Homer, it must appear an"
15980,SECT. III.,"erroneous course to use his numerical statements as literal, when"
15981,SECT. III.,"they are applied to time, after we have had so much evidence of their"
15982,SECT. III.,generally ornamental and figurative character.
15983,SECT. III.,
15984,SECT. III.,"When Homer has occasion to define distance, he does not attempt to"
15985,SECT. III.,"do it by a fixed measure, but by reference always to human or other"
15986,SECT. III.,"action: it is as far as a man can throw a spear, (δουρὸς ἐρώη); or as"
15987,SECT. III.,"far as a man’s cry can be heard (ὅσον τε γέγωνε βόησας); or as far,"
15988,SECT. III.,"when we come to larger spaces, as we can sail within a certain time; if"
15989,SECT. III.,"I make a good passage, says Achilles[820], I may get to Phthia on the"
15990,SECT. III.,"third day: and again, we hear of the distance that a ship can perform"
15991,SECT. III.,"within the day[821]. The horses of the gods in Homer clear, at each"
15992,SECT. III.,"bound, a space as large as the eye can cover along the surface of the"
15993,SECT. III.,"sea. As he comes to speak of points more remote and less known, he"
15994,SECT. III.,"becomes greatly more vague, and says of Egypt, that even the birds do"
15995,SECT. III.,not get back from it within the year[822]: without doubt drawing his
15996,SECT. III.,idea from those birds which periodically migrate.

16029,SECT. III.,
16030,SECT. III.,I do not remember that he ever mentions a very high number of days or
16031,SECT. III.,"of years, but his use of both days and years, when it does not embrace"
16032,SECT. III.,"terms defined by custom, has the marks of being highly poetical. Take"
16033,SECT. III.,"for instance the principal and almost only statements of the poem, that"
16034,SECT. III.,can claim to be called chronological. They are those which represent
16035,SECT. III.,"the period of the siege as a decade of years, preceded by a decade"
16036,SECT. III.,"of preparation, and followed by a third decade for the vicissitudes"
16037,SECT. III.,"of the Return. Here are three terms of years, all found in a Poet,"
16038,SECT. III.,"who does not elsewhere deal in terms of years at all. Of history,"
16039,SECT. III.,"or what purports to be such, Homer has given us a great deal, and"
16040,SECT. III.,he has placed it in the exactest and clearest order. But in no one
16041,SECT. III.,"instance, out of all his prior history, does he found himself on any"
16042,SECT. III.,"numerical definitions of time. Moreover, these three terms of years"
16043,SECT. III.,"are all exactly equal, which heightens the unlikelihood of their being"
16044,SECT. III.,"historical. Lastly, the three terms are just of the number of years"
16045,SECT. III.,"required to make up what was, according to all appearances, the Homeric"
16046,SECT. III.,"term of a γενεὴ, or generation of men."
16047,SECT. III.,
16048,SECT. III.,"The passage, on which the proof of this last assertion must principally"
16049,SECT. III.,"be founded, is that in the First Book[824], which describes the age of"
16050,SECT. III.,Nestor;
16051,SECT. III.,

16057,SECT. III.,
16058,SECT. III.,"I take the word γενεὴ to mean here, ‘the term of thirty years,’ but"
16059,SECT. III.,with the necessary qualification of ‘_or_ thereabouts;’ and for the
16060,SECT. III.,following reasons:
16061,SECT. III.,
16062,SECT. III.,Nestor is represented in the Iliad as the oldest of the Greek
16063,SECT. III.,"chieftains of the first order. Yet Ulysses[825] was elderly, ὠμογέρων."
16064,SECT. III.,"Idomeneus, again, was older than Ulysses, as is plain from the"
16065,SECT. III.,more marked manner in which his advance in years is described. He
16066,SECT. III.,"is μεσαιπόλιος[826], and not fully ablebodied, as appears from his"
16067,SECT. III.,somewhat limited share in military operations; but Nestor is evidently
16068,SECT. III.,"older than Idomeneus, as he always addresses the whole body with the"
16069,SECT. III.,"authority that belongs to the most extended experience, and as he"
16070,SECT. III.,"never takes an active part, either in battle or in the games. We must,"
16071,SECT. III.,"accordingly, suppose Nestor to be represented as at this time an old"
16072,SECT. III.,"man of seventy, or from that to seventy-five."
16073,SECT. III.,
16074,SECT. III.,[825] Il. xxiii. 791.
16075,SECT. III.,
16076,SECT. III.,[826] Il. xiii. 361.
16077,SECT. III.,
16078,SECT. III.,"Now the passage implies that he was in the third γενεὴ, and in the"
16079,SECT. III.,"midst, i. e. not at either extremity, of it: the words are μετὰ"
16080,SECT. III.,τριτάτοισιν. No lower number than thirty years will place Nestor fairly
16081,SECT. III.,"among, or in the midst of, the third generation from his birth. If, for"
16082,SECT. III.,"example, we take five and twenty years as the term, he would have been"
16083,SECT. III.,not so much among the third as on the eve of arriving within the fourth
16084,SECT. III.,"generation. But neither can we assign to γενεὴ any meaning, which shall"
16085,SECT. III.,make it sensibly exceed thirty years. For as we may say with confidence
16086,SECT. III.,"that the Nestor of the Iliad is over seventy, so, on the other hand,"
16087,SECT. III.,"we may fairly compute that he is under eighty; inasmuch as, though"
16088,SECT. III.,"he takes no part in exertions actually athletic, he spares himself"
16089,SECT. III.,"nothing else. He is found by Agamemnon, when the commander in chief"
16090,SECT. III.,"goes his rounds, on the field and at the head of his division: he is"
16091,SECT. III.,"wakeful for the night council, and he goes about awaking others[827]."
16092,SECT. III.,"Retaining so large a share of bodily activity, he is still not"
16093,SECT. III.,represented as possessed of strength in such a degree as to border upon
16094,SECT. III.,"the marvellous; he is simply, in regard to corporal qualities, what"
16095,SECT. III.,would now be called a remarkably fine old gentleman. But if instead of
16096,SECT. III.,"thirty we were to take forty years, then, in order to have well entered"
16097,SECT. III.,"into the third term he must have been already much beyond eighty,"
16098,SECT. III.,"indeed, probably beyond ninety, in the Iliad, and above an hundred in"
16099,SECT. III.,"the Odyssey; an age, which, as he retains in that poem all his mental"
16100,SECT. III.,"powers, we may be quite sure Homer did not mean to assign to him. If,"
16101,SECT. III.,"then, γενεὴ meant any term of years, it must, in all likelihood, have"
16102,SECT. III.,been somewhere about thirty years.
16103,SECT. III.,
16104,SECT. III.,[827] Il. x. 157.
16105,SECT. III.,
16106,SECT. III.,"Homer has been careful, in the case of Nestor, to mark, by an"
16107,SECT. III.,"appropriate change of expressions, the difference between his age in"
16108,SECT. III.,the two poems respectively. In the Iliad he is exercising the kingly
16109,SECT. III.,office _among_ the third generation since his birth. In the Odyssey he
16110,SECT. III.,is said to have exhausted the three terms[828];
16111,SECT. III.,
16112,SECT. III.,[828] Od. iii. 245. The meaning may be that he had _reigned_ for above
16113,SECT. III.,two generations: but in the Iliad no more is implied than that he had
16114,SECT. III.,_lived_ well into a third.
16115,SECT. III.,
16116,SECT. III.,τρὶς γὰρ δή μίν φασιν ἀνάξασθαι γενε’ ἀνδρῶν.
16117,SECT. III.,
16118,SECT. III.,"That lucidity and accuracy in Homer’s expressions, to which we are so"
16119,SECT. III.,"often beholden, may stand us yet further in good stead. Two γενεαὶ"
16120,SECT. III.,"had passed, not of men at large, but of _the_ men οἵ οἱ πρόσθεν ἅμα"
16121,SECT. III.,"τράφεν ἠδ’ ἐγένοντο, of those who were bred and born with him, of his"
16122,SECT. III.,contemporaries. Now this proves that by γενεὴ Homer does not mean the
16123,SECT. III.,"full duration of human life, but that average interval between the"
16124,SECT. III.,"successions of men, which general experience places at about thirty"
16125,SECT. III.,years. For if Homer had meant by γενεὴ the whole time required for
16126,SECT. III.,"the dying out of a generation, Nestor could not have outlived two"
16127,SECT. III.,"generations of contemporaries. In this sense, his contemporaries were"
16128,SECT. III.,"manifestly not two generations, but one, or little more. But if the"
16129,SECT. III.,"Poet meant the usual interval at which child succeeds to, or rather"
16130,SECT. III.,"follows upon, father, the expression is clear; for the meaning is, that"
16131,SECT. III.,"he had seen two of these terms of years, or successions, pass over"
16132,SECT. III.,those who were born at the same time with himself. And in fact this
16133,SECT. III.,sense of the term γενεὴ is much closer to its etymology than any other.
16134,SECT. III.,"We may, then, on the whole, pretty safely assume it to be a term of"
16135,SECT. III.,"years, having the number thirty, so to speak, for its pivot. And thus"
16136,SECT. III.,the three decades of the war become yet more inadmissible as historical
16137,SECT. III.,"expressions, because they are under the strongest suspicion of being"
16138,SECT. III.,"poetically employed in order to make up the γενεὴ, so far at least as"
16139,SECT. III.,they and it can be considered to approximate to an actual number at all.
16140,SECT. III.,
16141,SECT. III.,"In full conformity with this reasoning, it has been shown by Mure,"
16142,SECT. III.,"that the events of the third decade, with their times, instead of ten"
16143,SECT. III.,"years only, make up eight years and seven months[829]: and he proceeds"
16144,SECT. III.,"in the same direction with the foregoing argument so far, at least, as"
16145,SECT. III.,"to observe, that the decades and their arrangement are conceived ‘in a"
16146,SECT. III.,"mixed spirit of hyperbole and method,’ which commonly marks the genius"
16147,SECT. III.,of heroic romance[830].

16152,SECT. III.,
16153,SECT. III.,"That, however, which enables me with great confidence at once to urge"
16154,SECT. III.,"Homer’s historical authority, and yet to decline recognising him as a"
16155,SECT. III.,"chronologist at all, is the fact, that he nowhere founds his history at"
16156,SECT. III.,"all in chronology, or in the numbering of events by years, more than"
16157,SECT. III.,"he numbers distances by miles, but that he arranges the succession"
16158,SECT. III.,of occurrences by the γενεαὶ or succession of human generations. On
16159,SECT. III.,these generations we must look as the real time-keeping organism of his
16160,SECT. III.,"works: and the time with its elastic periods, although indeterminate in"
16161,SECT. III.,"its details, is kept by him most accurately and effectually as a whole;"
16162,SECT. III.,"so that his generations, which are dispersedly recorded in various"
16163,SECT. III.,"parts of the poems, always tally when they meet. This is not the place"
16164,SECT. III.,"for the proof of the assertion: I only refer to it, because it may help"
16165,SECT. III.,to dispel the illusion apt to possess the mind with respect to Homer’s
16166,SECT. III.,"decades. We, with our definite numerical ideas, may naturally consider"
16167,SECT. III.,"that if an author of our own day had said a war lasted in preparation,"
16168,SECT. III.,"action, and return, each ten years, and if it was afterwards found"
16169,SECT. III.,perhaps to have lasted (say) only for ten years altogether or little
16170,SECT. III.,"more, such an author would have proved himself unworthy of belief: he"
16171,SECT. III.,would have broken faith with us. But Homer does not break faith with
16172,SECT. III.,us in using numbers poetically; they belong to his pictorial and not
16173,SECT. III.,"to his historical apparatus, and in connection with this pictorial"
16174,SECT. III.,apparatus it is that he constantly employs them. I doubt if there is
16175,SECT. III.,"any exception to be made to the broad assertion, that, unless in the"
16176,SECT. III.,"single case of the war, with the preceding and following decades,"
16177,SECT. III.,Homer never applies number to narrative. And yet the poems are full of
16178,SECT. III.,"independent narratives. Of all these, very few indeed are left unfixed"
16179,SECT. III.,"in date; and in every case the date, when found, is found, of course"
16180,SECT. III.,"with a certain margin, by means of the order of generations."
16181,SECT. III.,
16182,SECT. III.,~_Difficulties of the literal interpretation._~
16183,SECT. III.,
16184,SECT. III.,"Now this view of Homer’s mode of chronology will serve, I think, to"
16185,SECT. III.,explain some difficulties that have heretofore led to much of needless
16186,SECT. III.,"perplexity. If I am right, it will follow that we must not adopt"
16187,SECT. III.,these decades as a guide to determine arithmetically the order of
16188,SECT. III.,"events, because Homer has never conceived them arithmetically, but"
16189,SECT. III.,has conceived them rather as we conceive millions or billions. Hence
16190,SECT. III.,they are more justly to be viewed as a drapery thrown loosely over
16191,SECT. III.,"his action, than as a rigid framework into which it must at all costs"
16192,SECT. III.,be made to fit. Let us apply this to various cases; and among them
16193,SECT. III.,to those of Telemachus and Neoptolemus respectively. Ulysses left
16194,SECT. III.,"Telemachus a mere child, νέον γεγαῶτ’ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ[831]. He comes back and"
16195,SECT. III.,"finds him not a full man, for if he had been a full man, he would have"
16196,SECT. III.,"been guilty of a rooted cowardice beyond excuse, which there is no sign"
16197,SECT. III.,that Homer meant to impute to him; but yet he was approaching manhood.
16198,SECT. III.,Still he is contemptuously called νέος παῖς[832] by Antinous. Upon the
16199,SECT. III.,"whole, the case of Telemachus would perhaps, according to the analogy"
16200,SECT. III.,"of the poems, best fall in with an absence of not more than fifteen"
16201,SECT. III.,"years, though it does not absolutely exclude nineteen. Here there may"
16202,SECT. III.,"be a slight, yet there is not a glaring, discrepancy. But in another"
16203,SECT. III.,"case, that of the number of the days for which Telemachus was absent,"
16204,SECT. III.,"Mure has shown how little Homer cares to follow the lapse of time, in"
16205,SECT. III.,a case where it does not essentially touch the general order of the
16206,SECT. III.,"poem, with the precision that he observes in everything that he treats"
16207,SECT. III.,historically[833]. I cannot treat this as a difficulty with respect to
16208,SECT. III.,"the question of authorship, or admit it to be one: it is his childlike"
16209,SECT. III.,"and indeterminate but poetical habit of handling numbers for effect,"
16210,SECT. III.,"just as a painter handles colour. On the other hand, in the case of"

16223,SECT. III.,he precisely coincides with his own decades. Yet I believe he does
16224,SECT. III.,"this not from any sense of the necessity of such coincidence, but"
16225,SECT. III.,because in that incomparable passage he had the extreme old age of a
16226,SECT. III.,"dog to represent, and to this the expression of the twentieth year"
16227,SECT. III.,"was suited. When, however, we come to the case of Neoptolemus, we"
16228,SECT. III.,"find this to be one extremely difficult of adjustment for any critic,"
16229,SECT. III.,who would insist upon a merely numerical precision in Homer. We must
16230,SECT. III.,indeed dismiss from our minds the tales about the concealment of a
16231,SECT. III.,"beardless Achilles at Scyros, under a female disguise; from which he"
16232,SECT. III.,was extracted by the art of Ulysses. Of these stories Homer knows
16233,SECT. III.,nothing; though it seems probable that the grace and beauty of the
16234,SECT. III.,"great warrior, as he stands in Homer, may have been connected with,"
16235,SECT. III.,"or may have suggested, them. But what the Poet does represent is,"
16236,SECT. III.,"that Achilles went to Troy when without experience in war, that he"
16237,SECT. III.,"was put under a certain tutelage of Phœnix his original teacher, and"
16238,SECT. III.,"now one of his lieutenants, that Patroclus as his senior was desired"
16239,SECT. III.,"by Peleus to give him good advice, and that he is called νήπιος[835]."
16240,SECT. III.,Yet his son Neoptolemus succeeds him in command before the close of
16241,SECT. III.,"the war, and attains to very high distinction. It is yet more needful"
16242,SECT. III.,"to be observed, that his distinction is in council, as well as in"
16243,SECT. III.,"the field[836]. The age of Achilles is, indeed, presumably somewhat"
16244,SECT. III.,"raised by the fact, that Phœnix seems to represent himself as a good"
16245,SECT. III.,"deal younger than Peleus, who, he says, treated him as a father might"
16246,SECT. III.,"have done[837]. And again, Achilles is never represented as a young"
16247,SECT. III.,"man in the Iliad, while Diomed is so represented. Still there is a"
16248,SECT. III.,"decided incompatibility in the statements as to Achilles and his son,"
16249,SECT. III.,if we suppose that Homer carried in his mind the effect of his three
16250,SECT. III.,"decades, as determining precisely the growth of Neoptolemus in years"
16251,SECT. III.,"and strength; for Neoptolemus is more advanced at the end of the war,"
16252,SECT. III.,than his illustrious father had been at its beginning. Mure has been
16253,SECT. III.,at the pains[838] to arrange all these matters which depend on the
16254,SECT. III.,"decades chronologically, without, I think, removing the impression that"
16255,SECT. III.,"mere chronology is considerably strained by them, and that if strictly"
16256,SECT. III.,"judged, the narrative is, to all appearance, chargeable with some few"
16257,SECT. III.,years of maladjustment. It seems to me more near the truth to consider
16258,SECT. III.,"the three decades, together making up a γενεὴ, as a distribution of"
16259,SECT. III.,"time which the Poet adopted for its symmetry and grandeur, since it"
16260,SECT. III.,represented the war as absorbing an age or generation of men: but not
16261,SECT. III.,to hold him bound to adjust the relations of all the events he narrates
16262,SECT. III.,"with reference to a minute regularity of progression, which he seems"
16263,SECT. III.,"not to have taken into account, and which his hearers were probably"
16264,SECT. III.,quite incapable of appreciating. If we wish to test his historical
16265,SECT. III.,"credit, we may try him by his own scheme of chronology, namely, his"
16266,SECT. III.,genealogies. His legends embrace some seven generations. The same
16267,SECT. III.,characters are produced and reproduced in many of them; but they are
16268,SECT. III.,nowhere presented in such a way as to be inconsistent with their order
16269,SECT. III.,of succession according to the ordinary laws of human nature.

16283,SECT. III.,learned men to raise.
16284,SECT. III.,
16285,SECT. III.,"For instance; while we take the three decades of years historically,"
16286,SECT. III.,"we are perplexed by such questions as, How it came about that the"
16287,SECT. III.,Greeks[839] never had been mustered till nine years had passed.
16288,SECT. III.,"Secondly, how it was that the Trojans had never until then seen them"
16289,SECT. III.,in such force[840]; whereas we know that multitudes of the Greek army
16290,SECT. III.,had died[841]; and there is no sign that any such communication with
16291,SECT. III.,"their native country took place during the course of the war, as might"
16292,SECT. III.,"have sufficed to replenish their ranks. Thirdly, why the Trojans had"
16293,SECT. III.,"remained so closely shut within the walls, and yet at the same time"
16294,SECT. III.,"the Greeks had so seldom come near them, that Priam should not have"
16295,SECT. III.,learnt to know Agamemnon and his compeers by sight during so long a
16296,SECT. III.,"period; and this although Achilles may probably have been absent, for"
16297,SECT. III.,"considerable intervals, on his predatory expeditions. Fourthly, how it"
16298,SECT. III.,"came about that the great number of allies speaking various tongues,"
16299,SECT. III.,"who had gathered round Priam to assist him, should, like the Greek"
16300,SECT. III.,"army, not have been marshalled at an earlier time."

16309,SECT. III.,"expression for conveying the idea of effort lengthened in duration, as"
16310,SECT. III.,"well as extraordinary in intensity, difficulties like these, which at"
16311,SECT. III.,"the worst are perhaps not very serious, either wholly vanish, or are"
16312,SECT. III.,reduced to insignificant proportions. We are then at liberty to suppose
16313,SECT. III.,"that, without at all departing from the general truth of history, Homer"
16314,SECT. III.,"felt himself authorized to compress, to expand, or to group the events"
16315,SECT. III.,"of the war, in such a manner as he thought best for the concentration"

16322,SECT. IV.,_Homer’s Perceptions and Use of Colour._
16323,SECT. IV.,
16324,SECT. IV.,The subject of the Homeric numbers has been discussed at considerable
16325,SECT. IV.,"length, on account of its connection with important questions of"
16326,SECT. IV.,"history. That of colours may, even on its own merits, deserve a"
16327,SECT. IV.,"careful examination. This inquiry will resemble, however, the former"
16328,SECT. IV.,"discussion in the appearance of paradox, which the argument may seem"
16329,SECT. IV.,"to present. Next to the idea of number, there is none perhaps more"
16330,SECT. IV.,"definite to the modern mind generally, as well as in particular to"
16331,SECT. IV.,"the English mind, than that of colour. That our own country has some"
16332,SECT. IV.,"special aptitude in this respect, we may judge from the comparatively"
16333,SECT. IV.,"advantageous position, which the British painters have always held"
16334,SECT. IV.,as colourists among other contemporary schools. Nothing seems more
16335,SECT. IV.,"readily understood and retained by very young children among us, than"
16336,SECT. IV.,"the distinctions between the principal colours. In regard to one point,"
16337,SECT. IV.,the case of numbers is here reversed. There the idea becomes indefinite
16338,SECT. IV.,"as we ascend in the scale, here it is as we descend. Colour becomes"
16339,SECT. IV.,"doubtful as it becomes faint, more and more clear as it is accumulated"
16340,SECT. IV.,and heightened. But the facility with which we discriminate colour in
16341,SECT. IV.,"all its marked forms, is probably the result of traditional aptitude,"
16342,SECT. IV.,"since we seem to find, as we go far backward in human history, that the"
16343,SECT. IV.,faculty is less and less mature.
16344,SECT. IV.,
16345,SECT. IV.,"I am conscious that the subject, which is now before us, in reality"
16346,SECT. IV.,"deserves a scientific investigation, which I am not capable of"
16347,SECT. IV.,"affording to it: and also that we are, as yet, far from being able"
16348,SECT. IV.,to render the language of the ancients for colour into our own with
16349,SECT. IV.,"the confidence, which we can feel in almost every other department of"
16350,SECT. IV.,"interpretation. My endeavours will be limited, firstly, to a collection"
16351,SECT. IV.,"of ‘_realien_,’ or facts of the poems, in the case of Colour: and,"
16352,SECT. IV.,"secondly, to pointing out what appears to be the basis of the ideas and"
16353,SECT. IV.,"perceptions of Homer respecting it, and the relation of that basis to"
16354,SECT. IV.,the ideas of the later Greeks.
16355,SECT. IV.,
16356,SECT. IV.,"Among the signs of the immaturity which I have mentioned, the following"
16357,SECT. IV.,are found in the poems of Homer:
16358,SECT. IV.,
16359,SECT. IV.,I. The paucity of his colours.
16360,SECT. IV.,
16361,SECT. IV.,II. The use of the same word to denote not only different hues or tints
16362,SECT. IV.,"of the same colour, but colours which, according to us, are essentially"
16363,SECT. IV.,different.
16364,SECT. IV.,
16365,SECT. IV.,III. The description of the same object under epithets of colour
16366,SECT. IV.,fundamentally disagreeing one from the other.
16367,SECT. IV.,
16368,SECT. IV.,IV. The vast predominance of the most crude and elemental forms of
16369,SECT. IV.,"colour, black and white, over every other, and the decided tendency to"
16370,SECT. IV.,treat other colours as simply intermediate modes between these extremes.
16371,SECT. IV.,
16372,SECT. IV.,"V. The slight use of colour in Homer, as compared with other elements"
16373,SECT. IV.,"of beauty, for the purpose of poetic effect, and its absence in certain"
16374,SECT. IV.,cases where we might confidently expect to find it.

16396,SECT. IV.,as adjectives of definite colour.
16397,SECT. IV.,
16398,SECT. IV.,Now we must at once be struck with the poverty of the list which
16399,SECT. IV.,"has just been given, upon comparing it with our own list of primary"

16412,SECT. IV.,
16413,SECT. IV.,"8. White, the compound of all colours;"
16414,SECT. IV.,"9. Black, the negative or absence of them all."
16415,SECT. IV.,
16416,SECT. IV.,"Out of these nine, three at least stand unrepresented. For πόλιος"
16417,SECT. IV.,can mean none of them: and φοίνιξ can do no more than double either
16418,SECT. IV.,"πορφύρεος, or ξανθὸς, or ἐρυθρός. The most favourable presumptions"
16419,SECT. IV.,would perhaps arrange the Homeric list as follows:
16420,SECT. IV.,
16421,SECT. IV.,"1. λευκὸς, white."
16422,SECT. IV.,"2. μέλας, black."
16423,SECT. IV.,"3. ξανθὸς, yellow."
16424,SECT. IV.,"4. ἐρυθρὸς, red."
16425,SECT. IV.,"5. πορφύρεος, violet."
16426,SECT. IV.,"6. κυάνεος, indigo."
16427,SECT. IV.,
16428,SECT. IV.,"And thus orange, green, and blue would remain without any corresponding"
16429,SECT. IV.,"terms. But, in truth, when we examine further into Homer’s mode of"
16430,SECT. IV.,"employing his adjectives of colour in detail, we shall perceive that he"
16431,SECT. IV.,is by no means so rich as this classification would allow.
16432,SECT. IV.,
16433,SECT. IV.,"The other words which will presently be considered, but which have"
16434,SECT. IV.,very slight claims indeed to be treated as adjectives of definite
16435,SECT. IV.,"colour, are as follows:"
16436,SECT. IV.,
16437,SECT. IV.,1. χλωρός.
16438,SECT. IV.,2. αἰθαλόεις.
16439,SECT. IV.,3. ῥοδόεις.
16440,SECT. IV.,4. ἰόεις.
16441,SECT. IV.,5. οἴνοψ.
16442,SECT. IV.,6. μιλτοπάρηος.
16443,SECT. IV.,7. αἴθων.
16444,SECT. IV.,8. ἀργός.
16445,SECT. IV.,9. αἴολος.
16446,SECT. IV.,10. γλαυκός.
16447,SECT. IV.,11. χάροπος.
16448,SECT. IV.,12. σιγαλόεις.
16449,SECT. IV.,13. μαρμάρεος.
16450,SECT. IV.,
16451,SECT. IV.,"Along with each of these adjectives, which are the chief though not"
16452,SECT. IV.,"quite the only ones of their class in Homer, I shall take the cognate"
16453,SECT. IV.,"words, such as verbs or compounds, which may belong to them."
16454,SECT. IV.,
16455,SECT. IV.,~_Applications of them._~
16456,SECT. IV.,
16457,SECT. IV.,II. Let us now review the particular applications which Homer has
16458,SECT. IV.,"made of these words respectively. Among them, however, it will not be"
16459,SECT. IV.,"necessary to include λευκὸς and μέλας, because those epithets indicate"
16460,SECT. IV.,"ideas which have at all times been used, to a considerable extent, by"
16461,SECT. IV.,way of approximation only.
16462,SECT. IV.,
16463,SECT. IV.,1. ξανθὸς is applied by Homer to the following objects:
16464,SECT. IV.,
16465,SECT. IV.,"_a._ horses, ἵππων ξανθὰ κάρηνα, Il. ix. 407."
16466,SECT. IV.,
16467,SECT. IV.,"_b._ hair of men, ξανθὸς Μενέλαος, _passim_: Achilles, Il. i. 197."
16468,SECT. IV.,
16469,SECT. IV.,"_c._ hair of women, ξανθὴ Ἀγαμήδη, Il. xi. 739; Δημήτηρ, Il. v. 500."
16470,SECT. IV.,
16471,SECT. IV.,"2. ἐρυθρὸς is evidently the same word with the Latin _ruber_, and with"
16472,SECT. IV.,"our own ‘ruddy,’ as well as probably the German _roth_."
16473,SECT. IV.,
16474,SECT. IV.,It is used by Homer for
16475,SECT. IV.,
16476,SECT. IV.,_a._ Copper in Il. ix. 365.
16477,SECT. IV.,"_b._ Nectar, Il. xix. 38."
16478,SECT. IV.,"_c._ Wine, Od. v. 93."
16479,SECT. IV.,"_d._ Blood: in ἐρυθαίνω, Il. x. 484."
16480,SECT. IV.,
16481,SECT. IV.,"3. πορφύρεος again is the Latin _purpura_, and our ‘purple,’ as well as"
16482,SECT. IV.,our ‘porphyry.’ In the uses of this word we shall find for the first
16483,SECT. IV.,time a startling amount of obvious discrepancy: and it will require to
16484,SECT. IV.,"be considered in the proper place, whether this discrepancy is to be"
16485,SECT. IV.,"referred to a bold exercise of the Poet’s art, or to an undeveloped"
16486,SECT. IV.,knowledge and a consequently defective standard of colour.
16487,SECT. IV.,
16488,SECT. IV.,The word πορφύρεος is employed as follows for objects of sense:
16489,SECT. IV.,
16490,SECT. IV.,"_a._ Blood, Il. xvii. 361."
16491,SECT. IV.,
16492,SECT. IV.,"_b._ Dark cloud, ibid. 551."
16493,SECT. IV.,
16494,SECT. IV.,"_c._ Wave of a river when disturbed, Il. xxi. 326."
16495,SECT. IV.,
16496,SECT. IV.,"_d._ Wave of the sea, Il. i. 482; and the disturbed sea, Il. xvi. 391."
16497,SECT. IV.,
16498,SECT. IV.,"_e._ The ball with which the Phæacian dancers played, Od. viii. 373."
16499,SECT. IV.,
16500,SECT. IV.,"_f._ Garments, as Il. viii. 221; Od. iv. 115."
16501,SECT. IV.,
16502,SECT. IV.,"_g._ Carpets, as Od. xxi. 151; Il. xxiv. 645."
16503,SECT. IV.,
16504,SECT. IV.,"_h._ The rainbow, Il. xvii. 547."
16505,SECT. IV.,
16506,SECT. IV.,"_i._ Metaphorically it is applied to Death, Il. v. 83: and, as it would"
16507,SECT. IV.,"appear, to bloody death only."
16508,SECT. IV.,
16509,SECT. IV.,"Further, the verb πορφύρω is applied"
16510,SECT. IV.,
16511,SECT. IV.,"_a._ to the sea darkening, Il. xiv. 16."
16512,SECT. IV.,"_b._ to the mind brooding, Il. xx. 551."
16513,SECT. IV.,
16514,SECT. IV.,"Again, the compound ἁλιπόρφυρος is applied"
16515,SECT. IV.,
16516,SECT. IV.,"_a._ to wool, Od. vi. 53."
16517,SECT. IV.,"_b._ to garments woven of it, Od. xiii. 108."
16518,SECT. IV.,
16519,SECT. IV.,In this epithet we have the additional idea of the sea introduced; and
16520,SECT. IV.,it literally means ‘sea-purple.’ But I postpone any remark with respect
16521,SECT. IV.,"to Homer’s particular intention in the use of the word, until we come"
16522,SECT. IV.,"to the epithets derived from ἴον, a violet."
16523,SECT. IV.,
16524,SECT. IV.,Three forms of colour at least seem to be comprehended under this group
16525,SECT. IV.,of words;
16526,SECT. IV.,
16527,SECT. IV.,1. The redness of blood.
16528,SECT. IV.,
16529,SECT. IV.,"2. The purple proper, as of the sea in Il. i. 482. To this also"
16530,SECT. IV.,"probably belongs the rainbow, of whose seven colours three may be"
16531,SECT. IV.,said to belong to the family of blue: and which is termed blue by
16532,SECT. IV.,Shakespeare.
16533,SECT. IV.,
16534,SECT. IV.,3. The grey and leaden colour of a dark cloud when about to burst in
16535,SECT. IV.,"storm, and of a river when disturbed."
16536,SECT. IV.,
16537,SECT. IV.,We shall hereafter see reason to suppose that the word may also and
16538,SECT. IV.,often mean what is tawny or brown.
16539,SECT. IV.,
16540,SECT. IV.,~_Of κύανος and κυάνεος._~
16541,SECT. IV.,
16542,SECT. IV.,4. The word κυάνεος is very important in this inquiry; and
16543,SECT. IV.,unfortunately it is not less obscure.
16544,SECT. IV.,
16545,SECT. IV.,"It at once throws us back on the prior question, what was κύανος? But"
16546,SECT. IV.,this question remains almost wholly undetermined[842]; so that we must
16547,SECT. IV.,"follow, as well as we can, the Homeric applications of the word itself,"
16548,SECT. IV.,together with its adjective and its compounds. These are very numerous.
16549,SECT. IV.,First we have the substantive κύανος introduced in three places: in
16550,SECT. IV.,each of which it evidently belongs to a combination of colours as well
16551,SECT. IV.,as of substances.
16552,SECT. IV.,
16553,SECT. IV.,[842] See note at the end of the Section.
16554,SECT. IV.,
16555,SECT. IV.,_a._ Once it is κύανος simply. The interior wall of the hall of
16556,SECT. IV.,Alcinous is covered with sheets of copper[843]; and round the top is a
16557,SECT. IV.,θριγκὸς or fringe of κύανος. Od. vii. 87.
16558,SECT. IV.,
16559,SECT. IV.,[843] Ibid.
16560,SECT. IV.,
16561,SECT. IV.,_b._ Twice it is μέλας κύανος. On the breast-plate of Agamemnon there
16562,SECT. IV.,"are twenty stripes or layers of tin, twelve of gold, and ten μέλανος"
16563,SECT. IV.,"κυάνοιο. Il. xi. 24, Also;"
16564,SECT. IV.,
16565,SECT. IV.,"_c._ Upon his shield there were ten rounds of copper; and then,"
16566,SECT. IV.,"apparently on the face of the shield within these, twenty white bosses"
16567,SECT. IV.,"(ὄμφαλοι λευκοὶ) made of tin, if such be the meaning of κασσίτερος: in"
16568,SECT. IV.,"the centre of all, there was one boss μέλανος κυάνοιο. Il. xi. 35."
16569,SECT. IV.,
16570,SECT. IV.,"Passing now to κυάνεος, we come next to three passages where it may"
16571,SECT. IV.,"be questioned whether they describe colour only, or substance only, or"
16572,SECT. IV.,both.
16573,SECT. IV.,
16574,SECT. IV.,"_d._ Upon the breastplate of Agamemnon, which has ten layers of black"
16575,SECT. IV.,"κύανος, there are on either side three κυάνεοι δράκοντες (Il. xi. 26)."
16576,SECT. IV.,"These are compared to the rainbow, which, as we have already seen, is"
16577,SECT. IV.,described elsewhere as πορφυρεή.
16578,SECT. IV.,
16579,SECT. IV.,_e._ On the silver-plated belt of Agamemnon there is a κυάνεος δράκων.
16580,SECT. IV.,"Il. xi. 38, 9."
16581,SECT. IV.,
16582,SECT. IV.,"_f._ Around the golden vineyard on the shield of Achilles, with its"
16583,SECT. IV.,"silver stakes, there is a fence of κασσίτερος and a trench (κάπετος)"
16584,SECT. IV.,described as κυανέη. Il. xviii. 564.
16585,SECT. IV.,
16586,SECT. IV.,The other applications at once appear to have reference to colour only.
16587,SECT. IV.,
16588,SECT. IV.,_g._ To the eyebrows of Jupiter and Juno. Il. i. 528. xv. 102. xvii.
16589,SECT. IV.,209.
16590,SECT. IV.,
16591,SECT. IV.,_h._ To a dark cloud of vapour; but not to a storm-cloud. Il. xxiii.
16592,SECT. IV.,188. v. 345. xx. 418.
16593,SECT. IV.,
16594,SECT. IV.,"_i._ To the hair of Hector, Il. xxii. 402; and to the beard of Ulysses,"
16595,SECT. IV.,when he is restored to beauty by Minerva. Od. xvi. 176. With this we
16596,SECT. IV.,may compare the hyacinthine hair of Ulysses in Od. vi. 231.
16597,SECT. IV.,
16598,SECT. IV.,_j._ To the serried masses of the Greeks: πυκιναὶ κίνυντο φάλαγγες
16599,SECT. IV.,κυάνεαι. Il. iv. 281. Now this epithet must have been derived from
16600,SECT. IV.,"their arms, and these would probably be composed in the main of two"
16601,SECT. IV.,"elements, not easy to combine in a common idea of colour; firstly,"
16602,SECT. IV.,"copper, which is ruddy; and secondly, the hides of oxen upon the"
16603,SECT. IV.,"shields and elsewhere. Homer never (except in Il. xiii. 703, and Od."
16604,SECT. IV.,xiii. 32) describes these animals by any epithet of colour. In those
16605,SECT. IV.,two passages they are βόε οἴνοπε. This epithet will be considered
16606,SECT. IV.,"presently. In the meantime, we may assume it as probable, that a dark"
16607,SECT. IV.,"colour would predominate, and that accordingly we should so understand"
16608,SECT. IV.,"κυάνεαι: but the leaning towards _blue_, which so often characterizes"
16609,SECT. IV.,"the epithet, thus entirely escapes. The word is also applied to the"
16610,SECT. IV.,"Trojan host, in Il. xvi. 66."
16611,SECT. IV.,
16612,SECT. IV.,"_k._ Thetis puts on mourning garments for Patroclus, when about to"
16613,SECT. IV.,"appear to Achilles, Il. xxiv. 93."
16614,SECT. IV.,
16615,SECT. IV.,κάλυμμ’ ἕλε δῖα θεάων
16616,SECT. IV.,κυάνεον· τοῦ δ’ οὔτι μελάντερον ἔπλετο ἔσθος.
16617,SECT. IV.,
16618,SECT. IV.,"Here Homer is careful to inform us that the κάλυμμα, or hood and"
16619,SECT. IV.,"mantle, was the blackest garment possible; and, since in Il. iv. 287 we"
16620,SECT. IV.,"find that he was acquainted with pitch, we need not scruple to assume"
16621,SECT. IV.,"that here he speaks literally, and either means a real black, which,"
16622,SECT. IV.,"nevertheless, he also calls κυάνεον, or sees no difference between the"
16623,SECT. IV.,genuine black and the colour of κύανος.
16624,SECT. IV.,
16625,SECT. IV.,"_l._ When the wave of Charybdis retires, the shore appears ψάμμῳ"
16626,SECT. IV.,"κυανέῃ. Now the colour of sea-sand, when it has just been left by the"
16627,SECT. IV.,"wave, is a dull but also rather a light brown."
16628,SECT. IV.,
16629,SECT. IV.,We take now the compounds.
16630,SECT. IV.,
16631,SECT. IV.,1. κυανοχαίτης is applied
16632,SECT. IV.,
16633,SECT. IV.,"_a._ To Neptune, e. g. Il. xv. 174."
16634,SECT. IV.,
16635,SECT. IV.,"_b._ To a mare, Il. xx. 224."
16636,SECT. IV.,
16637,SECT. IV.,"2. κυανῶπις is applied to Amphitrite, or the sea, beating on rocks, Od."
16638,SECT. IV.,xii. 60.
16639,SECT. IV.,
16640,SECT. IV.,3. κυανόπεζα is used for the foot of a beautiful table (Il. xi. 628).
16641,SECT. IV.,Here possibly substance may be designated rather than colour. Metal at
16642,SECT. IV.,the foot would give steadiness to a table.
16643,SECT. IV.,
16644,SECT. IV.,4. We have κυανόπρωρος and κυανοπρώρειος for the prow of a ship.
16645,SECT. IV.,Evidently it is the coloured prow: for otherwise the prow would be of
16646,SECT. IV.,"the same hue with the rest of the ship. (Il. xv. 693, _et alibi_.) So"
16647,SECT. IV.,"the prows of ships are called μιλτοπάρηοι, in Il. ii. 637, and Od. ix."
16648,SECT. IV.,125. Now μίλτος was red earth or ochre; and yet it seems that Homer
16649,SECT. IV.,uses μιλτοπάρηος as equivalent to κυανόπρωρος. For the first epithet is
16650,SECT. IV.,applied in the Catalogue to the ships led by Ulysses; and the second in
16651,SECT. IV.,Od. x. 127 to the vessel in which he sailed.
16652,SECT. IV.,
16653,SECT. IV.,The uses of this group of words thus appear to exhibit a degree of
16654,SECT. IV.,"indefiniteness, hardly reconcilable with the supposition that Homer"
16655,SECT. IV.,possessed accurate ideas of colour. There is no one colour that can
16656,SECT. IV.,cover them all. The hood of Thetis is closely akin to black; the prow
16657,SECT. IV.,of a ship to at least a dull red; the sand is of russet or a lightish
16658,SECT. IV.,brown; the cloud a leaden grey; the hair and eyebrows are of a deep
16659,SECT. IV.,but not a dull colour; the cornice in the hall of Alcinous must have
16660,SECT. IV.,"been in relief and contrast as compared with the copper wall, and"
16661,SECT. IV.,"sufficiently light or clear to strike the eye at a distance, in an"
16662,SECT. IV.,interior lighted at night only from the ground. With perhaps this
16663,SECT. IV.,"exception, the word ‘dark’ will cover all the uses of κυάνεος: but dark"
16664,SECT. IV.,"derives its force from a relation to light, and not to colour."
16665,SECT. IV.,
16666,SECT. IV.,"~_Of φοίνιξ, πόλιος._~"
16667,SECT. IV.,
16668,SECT. IV.,5. Φοίνιξ in Homer is clearly a word descriptive of colour: but it as
16669,SECT. IV.,clearly partakes of the indefinite character attaching to the other
16670,SECT. IV.,words of the class.
16671,SECT. IV.,
16672,SECT. IV.,_a._ The blood drawn by Pandarus from Menelaus is compared to the
16673,SECT. IV.,"colour φοίνιξ, used for staining ivory. In this simile, the sense leans"
16674,SECT. IV.,"to red, especially as the hue of ivory is so near to that of flesh"
16675,SECT. IV.,"(Il. iv. 141). It is mentioned in other places, probably with the same"
16676,SECT. IV.,"sense, as an ornamental dye."
16677,SECT. IV.,
16678,SECT. IV.,"_b._ In Il. xxiii. 454, we learn that one of the horses of Diomed was"
16679,SECT. IV.,"φοίνιξ, with a round white mark on his forehead. Whether we render this"
16680,SECT. IV.,"bay or chestnut, it is materially different from the red colour of"
16681,SECT. IV.,blood.
16682,SECT. IV.,
16683,SECT. IV.,"_c._ Φοίνιος is used for blood, Od. xviii. 96."
16684,SECT. IV.,
16685,SECT. IV.,_d._ As is φοινὸς in Il. xvi. 159.
16686,SECT. IV.,
16687,SECT. IV.,_e._ And φοινικόεις in Il. xxiii. 716. This word is also applied to a
16688,SECT. IV.,"cloak, Il. x. 133."
16689,SECT. IV.,
16690,SECT. IV.,"_f._ A dragon or serpent, borne by an eagle, is φοινήεις, apparently"
16691,SECT. IV.,"because dappled or streaked with his own blood, Il. xii. 200-6, 218-21."
16692,SECT. IV.,
16693,SECT. IV.,"_g._ Ships are φοινικοπάρηοι, Od. xi. 123, and xxiii. 272: this word is"
16694,SECT. IV.,apparently synonymous with μιλτοπάρηοι.
16695,SECT. IV.,
16696,SECT. IV.,"_h._ The serpent is δάφοινος ἐπὶ νῶτα, Il. ii. 308. And we have the"
16697,SECT. IV.,"δάφοινον δέρμα λέοντος, Il. x. 23."
16698,SECT. IV.,
16699,SECT. IV.,"On the whole, we trace here not less than three senses: that in which"
16700,SECT. IV.,"φοίνιξ is applied to the horse, which appears to be the equivalent"
16701,SECT. IV.,"of ξανθὸς, the more prevailing word: next, that of the tawny and"
16702,SECT. IV.,dull-coloured lion’s hide: then that of the brighter but yet deep
16703,SECT. IV.,"colour of blood, which is freely called πορφύρεος. So that φοίνιξ"
16704,SECT. IV.,"merely renders other words, and does not at all assist to make up"
16705,SECT. IV.,deficiencies in the Homeric vocabulary for the expression of colour.
16706,SECT. IV.,
16707,SECT. IV.,"Considered as an epithet of colour, the word δάφοινος, meaning"
16708,SECT. IV.,"blood-red, is inappropriate to the dragon or serpent, and further"
16709,SECT. IV.,"serves to illustrate that vagueness, of which the signs multiply as we"
16710,SECT. IV.,proceed.
16711,SECT. IV.,
16712,SECT. IV.,6. πόλιος is applied in Homer as follows:
16713,SECT. IV.,
16714,SECT. IV.,"_a._ To human hair in connection with old age, Il. xxii. 74 _et alibi_."
16715,SECT. IV.,
16716,SECT. IV.,"_b._ To the sea, Il. i. 350 _et passim_. It remains to inquire, whether"
16717,SECT. IV.,"this refers to the sea, or to the foam upon it."
16718,SECT. IV.,
16719,SECT. IV.,"_c._ To iron, Il. ix. 366. xx. 261. Od. xxi. 3, 81. xxiv. 167."
16720,SECT. IV.,
16721,SECT. IV.,"_d._ To the hide of a wolf, which Dolon put on for his nocturnal"
16722,SECT. IV.,"expedition, Il. x. 334. The meaning of the word here appears to be not"
16723,SECT. IV.,‘gray’ but ‘white.’ It is Homer’s evident intention to exhibit Dolon as
16724,SECT. IV.,"a sort of simpleton[844] (x. 316, 17); and accordingly he takes a white"
16725,SECT. IV.,"covering, which makes him visible to the eye by night, so that Ulysses"
16726,SECT. IV.,"saw him (φράσατο, 339)."
16727,SECT. IV.,
16728,SECT. IV.,[844] The celebrated Hunter noticed that Homer had made Dolon an
16729,SECT. IV.,"only son with five sisters, as a proof of the Poet’s sagacity in"
16730,SECT. IV.,"observation: having himself found, that youths under such circumstances"
16731,SECT. IV.,are generally more or less effeminate. I owe this information to one of
16732,SECT. IV.,"the most distinguished living members of the profession, which Hunter"
16733,SECT. IV.,"himself adorned. It was also a favourite remark, I believe, with Mr."
16734,SECT. IV.,Rogers.
16735,SECT. IV.,
16736,SECT. IV.,"The last, then, of these four uses is _white_. The first clearly"
16737,SECT. IV.,inclines to the same idea. The second might bear either of two senses.
16738,SECT. IV.,"But iron cannot be brought nearer to white, even if we assume it to"
16739,SECT. IV.,"be always polished, than a bluish grey; which, in truth, is somewhat"
16740,SECT. IV.,"distant from white. It will, moreover, be seen, that Homer also"
16741,SECT. IV.,"describes iron as αἴθων, and as ἰόεις."
16742,SECT. IV.,
16743,SECT. IV.,~_The quasi-adjectives of colour._~
16744,SECT. IV.,
16745,SECT. IV.,"I now come to the class of words, in dealing with which it will be"
16746,SECT. IV.,shown that they have not in general even the pretensions of those that
16747,SECT. IV.,have preceded to be treated as adjectives of definite colour.
16748,SECT. IV.,
16749,SECT. IV.,"7. χλωρὸς is used in Homer,"
16750,SECT. IV.,
16751,SECT. IV.,"_a._ Chiefly in a metaphorical sense, as directly descriptive of fear."
16752,SECT. IV.,
16753,SECT. IV.,"_b._ For the paleness of the face derived from fear, as in χλωροὶ ὑπαὶ"
16754,SECT. IV.,"δείους, Il. x. 376 and xv. 4. This use discloses to us the basis of the"
16755,SECT. IV.,last-named metaphor.
16756,SECT. IV.,
16757,SECT. IV.,"_c._ For twigs, apparently when fresh-pulled by Eumæus to make a bed"
16758,SECT. IV.,"for Ulysses, who was an unexpected guest; Od. xvi. 47."
16759,SECT. IV.,
16760,SECT. IV.,"_d._ For honey, Il. xi. 630: where it must mean either pale, or fresh."
16761,SECT. IV.,
16762,SECT. IV.,"_e._ For the olive-wood club of the Cyclops in Od. ix. 320, 379. Here,"
16763,SECT. IV.,"for the first time, we find the word applied to an object that might"
16764,SECT. IV.,perhaps be called green. But still there are two observations to be
16765,SECT. IV.,"made. First, even the leaf of the olive is rather grey than green:"
16766,SECT. IV.,"and this is the bark, not the leaf, which is yet more grey, and yet"
16767,SECT. IV.,"less green. Secondly, the governing idea is not the greenness, but the"
16768,SECT. IV.,newness: for Ulysses says that he heated it in the ashes until it was
16769,SECT. IV.,"about to take fire, χλωρός περ ἐών; although freshly cut, and still"
16770,SECT. IV.,seething with the sap.
16771,SECT. IV.,
16772,SECT. IV.,_f._ The derivative χλωρηῒς is applied to the nightingale in Od. xix.
16773,SECT. IV.,"518, as a lover of the woods: and here the idea of greenness seems to"
16774,SECT. IV.,be rather less faintly indicated.
16775,SECT. IV.,
16776,SECT. IV.,"Upon the whole, then, χλωρὸς indicates rather the absence than the"
16777,SECT. IV.,"presence of definite colour, although it is derived from χλοὴ, meaning"
16778,SECT. IV.,"young herbage. If regarded as an epithet of colour, it involves at"
16779,SECT. IV.,once an hopeless contradiction between the colour of honey on the one
16780,SECT. IV.,"side, and greenness on the other. Again, the more we assume it to mean"
16781,SECT. IV.,"green, the more startling it becomes that it could have taken paleness,"
16782,SECT. IV.,"as is manifestly the case, for its governing idea. Next to paleness,"
16783,SECT. IV.,"it serves chiefly for freshness, i. e. as opposed to what is stale or"
16784,SECT. IV.,withered: a singular combination with the former sense. The idea of
16785,SECT. IV.,"green we scarcely find, unless once, connected with this word in the"
16786,SECT. IV.,poems of Homer: and yet it is a remarkable fact that there is no other
16787,SECT. IV.,"word in the poems that can even be supposed to represent a colour,"
16788,SECT. IV.,"which, not the rainbow only, but every day nature, presents so largely"
16789,SECT. IV.,to the eye.
16790,SECT. IV.,
16791,SECT. IV.,8. I take next the word αἰθαλόεις. The Homeric sense of this word seems
16792,SECT. IV.,somewhat to resemble that of κυάνεος; although there is the difference
16793,SECT. IV.,"between them, that the derivation here is from αἰθάλη, soot."
16794,SECT. IV.,
16795,SECT. IV.,"This epithet is applied by Homer, in sufficient conformity, as is"
16796,SECT. IV.,"contended, with the idea of soot,"
16797,SECT. IV.,
16798,SECT. IV.,"_a._ To the interior of the palace of Ulysses, Od. xxii. 239, and to"
16799,SECT. IV.,"that of Priam, Il. ii. 415. In the latter case the word will, as it"
16800,SECT. IV.,"appears from the context, bear to be construed with reference to the"
16801,SECT. IV.,state of a house blackened by a conflagration.
16802,SECT. IV.,
16803,SECT. IV.,"_b._ To the dark ash κόνις αἰθαλόεσσα, which Achilles poured over his"
16804,SECT. IV.,"head, Il. xviii. 23, and which, in ver. 25, is called μέλαινα τέφρη:"
16805,SECT. IV.,this material Laertes also used for the same purpose in Od. xxiv. 315.
16806,SECT. IV.,"Yet the propriety of the second of these two applications depends,"
16807,SECT. IV.,"first, upon the rather hardy supposition, that both Achilles and"
16808,SECT. IV.,"Laertes had by them, at the moment of their sorrow, the remains of a"
16809,SECT. IV.,"wood-fire; and, secondly, upon the assumption that the word κόνις may"
16810,SECT. IV.,mean fire-ashes as well as dust in general. But we may doubt both of
16811,SECT. IV.,"these assumptions; while, if κόνις means ‘dust,’ and αἰθαλόεις ‘sooty,’"
16812,SECT. IV.,"it becomes plain that this epithet is used, like others, with very"
16813,SECT. IV.,great latitude.
16814,SECT. IV.,
16815,SECT. IV.,"9. It may be admitted that, at a first view, the words ῥοδόεις and"
16816,SECT. IV.,ῥοδοδάκτυλος would appear to be in the strictest sense epithets of
16817,SECT. IV.,colour. But it still would seem that they add nothing to Homer’s
16818,SECT. IV.,"defective means of expressing it: and not only so, but, in fact, scanty"
16819,SECT. IV.,"as is their use, it is so little congruous, that we are driven to"
16820,SECT. IV.,"suppose he must have employed these words in a sense not only elastic,"
16821,SECT. IV.,but altogether indeterminate and purely figurative.
16822,SECT. IV.,
16823,SECT. IV.,"Ῥοδοδάκτυλος, or rosy-fingered, has become, through Homer’s example and"
16824,SECT. IV.,"authority, a classical epithet for the morning. It is, however, more"
16825,SECT. IV.,open to criticism than is usually the case with the Homeric epithets.
16826,SECT. IV.,"There is nothing strange in personifying Morn, in order to embellish"
16827,SECT. IV.,"her with an epithet belonging to personal beauty; but redness, applied"
16828,SECT. IV.,"to the fingers, and not merely to their tips, is more than equivocal in"
16829,SECT. IV.,"this respect, since that colour is only even admissible in the interior"
16830,SECT. IV.,"of the hand, which is the part not seen, and therefore presumably the"
16831,SECT. IV.,part not intended in ῥοδοδάκτυλος.
16832,SECT. IV.,
16833,SECT. IV.,"There are certain very fugitive tints of the sky, which approach to the"
16834,SECT. IV.,hue of the rose: but if Homer had the colour of that flower definitely
16835,SECT. IV.,"in his view, it is most singular that he should never use it, either"
16836,SECT. IV.,"for the human form or otherwise, except on this and one other occasion"
16837,SECT. IV.,only.
16838,SECT. IV.,
16839,SECT. IV.,The nature of that other occasion is yet more strange. Hector’s corpse
16840,SECT. IV.,"is anointed, in Il. xxiii. 186, with rosy oil, ῥοδόεντι ἐλαίῳ. It does"
16841,SECT. IV.,not appear allowable to follow Damm in rendering this as oil _made
16842,SECT. IV.,"from_ roses: for we have no such thing as ἔλαιον in Homer, except from"
16843,SECT. IV.,the olive-tree. It therefore applies to the hue of olive oil: and no
16844,SECT. IV.,conceivable use of an epithet could be more conclusive to show an
16845,SECT. IV.,"extreme vagueness in the Poet’s ideas of colour, as well as probably in"
16846,SECT. IV.,those of his age.
16847,SECT. IV.,
16848,SECT. IV.,"10. The violet, no less than the rose, has supplied Homer with"
16849,SECT. IV.,"epithets, which he has used in such a manner as to deprive them of all"
16850,SECT. IV.,specific force as vehicles for the expression of a peculiar colour.
16851,SECT. IV.,
16852,SECT. IV.,"There is certainly a great temptation, when we find in Homer the"
16853,SECT. IV.,"ἰοειδέα πόντον, to give him credit for the full meaning of this very"
16854,SECT. IV.,"beautiful epithet, which he uses thrice for the sea (Il. ix. 298, Od."
16855,SECT. IV.,"v. 55, xi. 106), and never in any other connection. But when we examine"
16856,SECT. IV.,"his employment of cognate words, it is obvious that he can mean little"
16857,SECT. IV.,"more by the epithet, than to convey a rather vague idea of darkness."
16858,SECT. IV.,
16859,SECT. IV.,For he uses ἰόεις as an epithet for iron (Il. xxiii. 850): and
16860,SECT. IV.,"ἰοδνεφὴς, first for the wool (Od. iv. 135) with which Helen is"
16861,SECT. IV.,spinning. Here we might be tempted to presume a purple dye. Yet it
16862,SECT. IV.,would be a somewhat strained supposition: for what title have we to say
16863,SECT. IV.,that dyeing was in use among the Greeks of the Homeric age? Do we hear
16864,SECT. IV.,"of any dye except that of the φοίνιξ, a name which tends to indicate"
16865,SECT. IV.,a foreign character? And does not the introduction of the Mæonian
16866,SECT. IV.,"or Carian woman in the simile of Il. iv. 141, to stain the ivory--a"
16867,SECT. IV.,"most simple example of the art, or scarcely an example at all--afford"
16868,SECT. IV.,"a strong presumption, that the art was foreign to Greece? Such is"
16869,SECT. IV.,"apparently the true inference: but, if it be the true one, then we at"
16870,SECT. IV.,"once lose the specific force of purple for all the mantles, carpets,"
16871,SECT. IV.,"and the like, in the poems; and we are only entitled to presume them to"
16872,SECT. IV.,have been woven of a dark wool.
16873,SECT. IV.,
16874,SECT. IV.,"This construction is supported by the second and only other passage,"
16875,SECT. IV.,in which Homer has used the word ἰοδνεφής. For here (Od. ix. 426) he
16876,SECT. IV.,speaks of the living sheep of Polyphemus as
16877,SECT. IV.,
16878,SECT. IV.,"καλοί τε μεγάλοι τε, ἰοδνεφὲς εἶρος ἔχοντες."
16879,SECT. IV.,
16880,SECT. IV.,"This passage appears evidently to apply to what we term black sheep,"
16881,SECT. IV.,"which are more strictly of a dark brown. So viewed, it affords another"
16882,SECT. IV.,"most striking token of the indeterminateness of Homeric colours, that"
16883,SECT. IV.,the name of the violet can be employed with such a signification. And
16884,SECT. IV.,"it also seems to carry forward the proof that the πορφύρεαι χλαῖναι,"
16885,SECT. IV.,"the ῥήγεα, and all other woven objects with that epithet annexed, were"
16886,SECT. IV.,in reality either black or brown.
16887,SECT. IV.,
16888,SECT. IV.,11. Homer employs the word οἴνοψ with evident relation to colour; but
16889,SECT. IV.,"it is for two objects only, viz."
16890,SECT. IV.,
16891,SECT. IV.,"_a._ For oxen, in Il. xiii. 703, and Od. xiii. 32."
16892,SECT. IV.,
16893,SECT. IV.,"_b._ For the sea, without reference to any peculiar state of it, in"
16894,SECT. IV.,"Il. i. 350, _et alibi_."
16895,SECT. IV.,
16896,SECT. IV.,There is no small difficulty in combining these two uses by reference
16897,SECT. IV.,"to the idea of a common colour. The sea is blue, grey, or green. Oxen"
16898,SECT. IV.,"are black, bay, or brown. I do not refer to their lighter colours,"
16899,SECT. IV.,"which are excluded by the nature of the epithet. It is remarkable that,"
16900,SECT. IV.,"among colours properly so called, Homer has none whatever, derived from"
16901,SECT. IV.,"the name of an object, that are light, unless it be in the case of"
16902,SECT. IV.,"the rose. The violet, the unknown κύανος, the φοίνιξ, the αἰθαλὴ, the"
16903,SECT. IV.,"ἁλιπόρφυρος, the πορφύρη, whatever else they may be, are all dark. And"
16904,SECT. IV.,to this class οἴνοψ evidently belongs.
16905,SECT. IV.,
16906,SECT. IV.,Wine is mentioned by Homer in nearly one hundred and forty places:
16907,SECT. IV.,in the majority of them it has an epithet: but only ten times is it
16908,SECT. IV.,"described by an epithet of colour. Of these two are used for it,"
16909,SECT. IV.,"ἐρυθρὸς and μέλας; so that he plainly conceived of it as dark, but"
16910,SECT. IV.,probably without a determinate hue. He more frequently calls it αἴθοψ:
16911,SECT. IV.,"but this word, which fluctuates between the ideas of flame and smoke,"
16912,SECT. IV.,"either means tawny, or else refers to light, and not to colour, and"
16913,SECT. IV.,bears the sense of sparkling.
16914,SECT. IV.,
16915,SECT. IV.,"Thus then οἴνοψ, like so many other words that we have gone through,"
16916,SECT. IV.,"vaguely indicates a dark hue, but cannot be referred to any one of the"
16917,SECT. IV.,known principal colours.
16918,SECT. IV.,
16919,SECT. IV.,12. The word μιλτοπάρηος has already been disposed of in connection
16920,SECT. IV.,with κυάνεος and φοίνιξ.
16921,SECT. IV.,
16922,SECT. IV.,13. αἴθων is applied in Homer
16923,SECT. IV.,
16924,SECT. IV.,"_a._ to horses, as in Il. ii. 839; viii. 185."
16925,SECT. IV.,
16926,SECT. IV.,"_b._ to iron, as in Od. i. 184."
16927,SECT. IV.,
16928,SECT. IV.,"_c._ to a lion, as in Il. x. 23."
16929,SECT. IV.,
16930,SECT. IV.,"_d._ to copper utensils, as in Il. ix. 123; xxiv. 233."
16931,SECT. IV.,
16932,SECT. IV.,"_e._ to a bull, Il. xvi. 488; and to oxen, Od. xviii. 371."
16933,SECT. IV.,
16934,SECT. IV.,"_f._ to an eagle, Il. xv. 690."
16935,SECT. IV.,
16936,SECT. IV.,With this word we may take its compound αἴθοψ. It is used
16937,SECT. IV.,
16938,SECT. IV.,"_a._ for wine, as we have seen."
16939,SECT. IV.,
16940,SECT. IV.,"_b._ for copper, Il. iv. 495 _et alibi_."
16941,SECT. IV.,
16942,SECT. IV.,"_c._ for smoke, Od. x. 152."
16943,SECT. IV.,
16944,SECT. IV.,"We have also the Αἰθίοπες, men of the tawny or swarthy countenance,"
16945,SECT. IV.,beneath the Southern sun.
16946,SECT. IV.,
16947,SECT. IV.,In what manner are we to find a common thread upon which to hang the
16948,SECT. IV.,"colours of iron, copper, horses, lions, bulls, eagles, wine, swarthy"
16949,SECT. IV.,"men, and smoke? We must here again adopt the vague word ‘dark,’ a word"
16950,SECT. IV.,"of light and not of colour, for the purpose. But as the idea of αἴθω"
16951,SECT. IV.,"includes flame struggling with smoke, so there may be a flash of light"
16952,SECT. IV.,"upon the dark object. Ψολόεις, sooty or smutty, belongs to the same"
16953,SECT. IV.,"group with αἰθαλόεις and αἴθων, and need not, therefore, be separately"
16954,SECT. IV.,discussed.
16955,SECT. IV.,
16956,SECT. IV.,All the remainder of the words noted for examination are to be dealt
16957,SECT. IV.,"with in two groups, each referable to a single idea: the first that of"
16958,SECT. IV.,"motion, and the second that of light."
16959,SECT. IV.,
16960,SECT. IV.,"14, 15. Among adjectives of motion, which have sometimes been"
16961,SECT. IV.,"improperly treated as adjectives of colour, are ἄργος and αἴολος."
16962,SECT. IV.,"The former acquires an affinity to _white_, because it may signify"
16963,SECT. IV.,"an object which, from being rapidly moved, assumes in the light the"
16964,SECT. IV.,"appearance of whiteness[845], and along with it may be placed its"
16965,SECT. IV.,"derivatives ἀργεννὸς, ἀργεστὴς, ἀργὴς, ἀργινόεις, ἀργιόδους, ἀργίπους,"
16966,SECT. IV.,"and ἀργικέραυνος. The latter, as in αἴολος ὄφις, αἴολος ἵππος,"
16967,SECT. IV.,"κορυθαίολος, πόδας αἴολος, seems to mean whatever from the same cause"
16968,SECT. IV.,appears to shift its hues.
16969,SECT. IV.,
16970,SECT. IV.,"[845] See Achæis, or Ethnology, p. 383."
16971,SECT. IV.,
16972,SECT. IV.,"16. Of those adjectives of light in Homer, which have also been taken"
16973,SECT. IV.,"for adjectives of colour, the most important is γλαυκός. Its uses,"
16974,SECT. IV.,"however, are only as follows:"
16975,SECT. IV.,
16976,SECT. IV.,"_a._ γλαυκὴ θάλασσα, Il. xvi. 34."
16977,SECT. IV.,
16978,SECT. IV.,"_b._ Γλαυκῶπις, the standing epithet, and even a proper name, of"
16979,SECT. IV.,"Minerva, Il. viii. 406."
16980,SECT. IV.,
16981,SECT. IV.,"_c._ γλαυκιόων; applied to the eye of a lion, when, reaching the height"
16982,SECT. IV.,"of his wrath, he makes his rush at the hunters, Il. xx. 172."
16983,SECT. IV.,
16984,SECT. IV.,The last of these passages seems effectually to fix the sense of the
16985,SECT. IV.,term. The word γλαυκιόων describes a progression. The lion does not
16986,SECT. IV.,"enhance the colour of his eye as he waxes angry. If, for example,"
16987,SECT. IV.,"γλαυκὸς can be taken as blue, it certainly does not become more blue:"
16988,SECT. IV.,"on the contrary, rage, when kindling fire in the eye, rather subdues"
16989,SECT. IV.,its peculiar tint by flooding it with a vivid light. So the word
16990,SECT. IV.,seems clearly to refer to the brightening flash of the eye under the
16991,SECT. IV.,"influence of passion. Of light and its movement, as also of sound,"
16992,SECT. IV.,"and of beautiful form, Homer’s conceptions are even more distinct"
16993,SECT. IV.,"and lively, than those of colour are, if not dull, yet at least"
16994,SECT. IV.,indeterminate.
16995,SECT. IV.,
16996,SECT. IV.,"Γλαυκὸς is derived from γλαύσσω; and has for its root λάω, to see. The"
16997,SECT. IV.,"meaning of bright or flashing will suit the sea, as well as the epithet"
16998,SECT. IV.,blue. And it suits Minerva far better. ‘Blue-eyed’ would be for her but
16999,SECT. IV.,"a tame epithet. The luminous eye, on the contrary, entirely accords"
17000,SECT. IV.,"with her character, and belongs to a marked trait of those primitive"
17001,SECT. IV.,"traditions, which she appears to represent[846]."
17002,SECT. IV.,
17003,SECT. IV.,"[846] See Olympus, sect. ii. p. 53. Welcker (_Griechische Götterlehre_,"
17004,SECT. IV.,"vi. 63, p. 300) treats the name Ἀθήνη as immediately akin to αἰθὴρ and"
17005,SECT. IV.,the idea of light.
17006,SECT. IV.,
17007,SECT. IV.,17. Χάροπος is applied to the lion in Od. xi. 611; and it is the
17008,SECT. IV.,"proper name of the father of Nireus in the Catalogue, while his mother"
17009,SECT. IV.,is Ἀγλαΐη. From this latter use we see that χάροπος is not in Homer
17010,SECT. IV.,an epithet of colour; since he never describes the face by means of
17011,SECT. IV.,colour. Its etymology refers us to gladsomeness; and this is much more
17012,SECT. IV.,"connected, in the Poet’s mind, with light than with colour."
17013,SECT. IV.,
17014,SECT. IV.,"18, 19. Besides these we have"
17015,SECT. IV.,
17016,SECT. IV.,"σιγαλόεις, glossy, like σίαλος, or fat; and μαρμάρεος, applied"
17017,SECT. IV.,
17018,SECT. IV.,"_a._ to a web, Il. iii. 126."
17019,SECT. IV.,
17020,SECT. IV.,"_b._ to the Ægis, Il. xvii. 594."
17021,SECT. IV.,
17022,SECT. IV.,"_c._ to the sea, Il. xiv. 273."
17023,SECT. IV.,
17024,SECT. IV.,"_d._ to the rim of the Shield, Il. xviii. 480."
17025,SECT. IV.,
17026,SECT. IV.,"We have also the μαρμαρυγαὶ ποδῶν (Od. viii. 265), or twinkling of the"
17027,SECT. IV.,feet in the dance: and the verb μαρμαίρω is applied to the eyes of
17028,SECT. IV.,"Venus (Il. iii. 397), to arms (Il. xii. 195 _et alibi_), and to the"
17029,SECT. IV.,"golden palace of Neptune (Il. xiii. 22). The marble, from which the"
17030,SECT. IV.,"words are derived, was white: but that signification would not suit any"
17031,SECT. IV.,"of the uses of the words, except the web of Helen. The sense, that will"
17032,SECT. IV.,"suit them, is one derived from the idea of light, that of glittering or"
17033,SECT. IV.,sparkling.
17034,SECT. IV.,
17035,SECT. IV.,Lastly: ἠεροειδὴς (Il. v. 770; Od. xiii. 103) is so evidently an
17036,SECT. IV.,"atmospheric epithet only, that it requires no detailed discussion. It"
17037,SECT. IV.,"is worthy of note, as it indicates the idea of atmospheric transparency."
17038,SECT. IV.,
17039,SECT. IV.,~_Conflict of colours in the same object._~
17040,SECT. IV.,
17041,SECT. IV.,"III. We might have attained to some nearly similar results, by taking"
17042,SECT. IV.,"the names of substantives in Homer, and considering the differences in"
17043,SECT. IV.,the epithets of colour by which he describes them.
17044,SECT. IV.,
17045,SECT. IV.,"Thus, for example, iron is violet, grey, and αἴθων or tawny. There is"
17046,SECT. IV.,a certain opposition between the first and second: a very marked one
17047,SECT. IV.,"between the second and third. When considered as names of colour, they"
17048,SECT. IV.,"cannot be reconciled, but they may perhaps be made in some degree to"
17049,SECT. IV.,harmonize by introducing the element of light. Iron is dark or tawny if
17050,SECT. IV.,in the shade: while under light it may appear grey.
17051,SECT. IV.,
17052,SECT. IV.,"Again, the dragon, or serpent, which is δάφοινος in Il. ii. 308, is"
17053,SECT. IV.,"also κυάνεος in Il. xi. 26; and is compared to the rainbow, which is"
17054,SECT. IV.,"πορφυρέη in Il. xvii. Δάφοινος, being applied to the lion’s hide in"
17055,SECT. IV.,"Il. x. 23, is essentially of a dull colour, but the rainbow is as"
17056,SECT. IV.,"essentially bright. Here, again, the only mode of harmonizing is by"
17057,SECT. IV.,the supposition that Homer really regulates the use of those epithets
17058,SECT. IV.,according to light; and thus the same object may be dull and bright in
17059,SECT. IV.,different positions.
17060,SECT. IV.,
17061,SECT. IV.,"Again, κέραυνος is in composition white (ἀργικέραυνος): but it is also"
17062,SECT. IV.,"ψολοεὶς, smutty. In truth it is neither: but its near connection both"
17063,SECT. IV.,with light and with darkness will admit of its being referred to either.
17064,SECT. IV.,
17065,SECT. IV.,~_Great predominance of white and black._~
17066,SECT. IV.,
17067,SECT. IV.,IV. I have next to notice the vast predominance in Homer of the two
17068,SECT. IV.,"simple opposites, white and black, which may be called, perhaps, the"
17069,SECT. IV.,elemental forms of colour: white being the compound of the seven
17070,SECT. IV.,"prismatic colours in their natural proportions, and black the absence,"
17071,SECT. IV.,"or simple negative, of them all."
17072,SECT. IV.,
17073,SECT. IV.,"The adjective μέλας, or ‘black,’ is used, in its different degrees,"
17074,SECT. IV.,"cases, and numbers, about one hundred and seventy times. Besides this,"
17075,SECT. IV.,"we have the verb μελαίνω, and several compounds from the adjective. It"
17076,SECT. IV.,also forms a very frequent element in proper names.
17077,SECT. IV.,
17078,SECT. IV.,"The word λευκὸς, or ‘white,’ is used nearly sixty times: its compound"
17079,SECT. IV.,"λευκώλενος forty more, but almost all of these as the stock-epithet"
17080,SECT. IV.,"of Juno, which should not be taken into the account. We have also"
17081,SECT. IV.,"λευκαίνω, λεύκασπις, and some proper names. But this by no means"
17082,SECT. IV.,exhausts Homer’s means of expressing whiteness. For that purpose he
17083,SECT. IV.,"also uses μαρμάρεος, σιγαλόεις, perhaps πόλιος, and an extensive group"
17084,SECT. IV.,"of words having ἀργὸς for its centre. In all, whiteness, or something"
17085,SECT. IV.,"intended for it, may perhaps be thus expressed one hundred times or"
17086,SECT. IV.,more.
17087,SECT. IV.,
17088,SECT. IV.,"Now assuming for the moment that adjectives of colour, in the prismatic"
17089,SECT. IV.,"sense of the word, are found in Homer, still it is remarkable how"
17090,SECT. IV.,"rarely they are found, in comparison with whiteness and blackness."
17091,SECT. IV.,
17092,SECT. IV.,"For example: except as a proper name, and as the stock-epithet of"
17093,SECT. IV.,"Menelaus, ξανθὸς is, I think, hardly found ten times in Homer."
17094,SECT. IV.,"Ἰόεις, and its cognate words, come but six times: ῥοδόεις is an ἅπαξ"
17095,SECT. IV.,λεγόμενον: μίλτος is only introduced in its compound twice; yet it
17096,SECT. IV.,is probably the best _red_ in Homer: ἐρυθρὸς and ἐρυθαίνω come but
17097,SECT. IV.,thirteen times: πορφύρεος and the kindred words are found in all
17098,SECT. IV.,"twenty-three times; but it has, I think, been shown that this word was"
17099,SECT. IV.,"wanting, with Homer, in the ingredient of specific colour, and only"
17100,SECT. IV.,"implied what was dark, whether brown, crimson, purple, or even black."
17101,SECT. IV.,
17102,SECT. IV.,~_Omissions to specify colour._~
17103,SECT. IV.,
17104,SECT. IV.,"V. It remains to complete this circle of evidence, by adducing cases"
17105,SECT. IV.,"where Homer’s omission to name colour, or to describe by means of it,"
17106,SECT. IV.,is deserving of remark.
17107,SECT. IV.,
17108,SECT. IV.,"1. Homer’s similes are so rich in the use of all sensible imagery,"
17109,SECT. IV.,that we might have expected to find colour a frequent and prominent
17110,SECT. IV.,"ingredient in them. But it is not so. They turn chiefly, I think, upon"
17111,SECT. IV.,the following ideas:
17112,SECT. IV.,
17113,SECT. IV.,1. Motion.
17114,SECT. IV.,2. Force.
17115,SECT. IV.,3. Form.
17116,SECT. IV.,4. Sound.
17117,SECT. IV.,5. Symmetry.
17118,SECT. IV.,6. Number.
17119,SECT. IV.,7. Light and Darkness.
17120,SECT. IV.,"8. Very rarely, upon Colour."
17121,SECT. IV.,
17122,SECT. IV.,In the greater part of them colour is not even mentioned. I have seen
17123,SECT. IV.,the similes of the poems reckoned at two hundred: and I have found it
17124,SECT. IV.,"difficult to note more than three which turn upon colour, even when it"
17125,SECT. IV.,is vaguely conceived.
17126,SECT. IV.,
17127,SECT. IV.,"The first is the blood of Menelaus, compared to a crimson dye, on the"
17128,SECT. IV.,"cheek-piece of a horse, Il. iv. 141."
17129,SECT. IV.,
17130,SECT. IV.,"The second, the meditations of Nestor, likened to the darkening of the"
17131,SECT. IV.,"sea before a storm, Il. xiv. 16-22."
17132,SECT. IV.,
17133,SECT. IV.,"Thirdly, the cloud in which Minerva is wrapped is compared to the"
17134,SECT. IV.,"rainbow, Il. xvii. 547-52."
17135,SECT. IV.,
17136,SECT. IV.,"Of these the second is very indefinite: the idea of the first, as we"
17137,SECT. IV.,"have seen, was inaccurately and loosely conceived: and the third is one"
17138,SECT. IV.,of the most striking proofs of the want of a close discrimination of
17139,SECT. IV.,colours in Homer.
17140,SECT. IV.,
17141,SECT. IV.,"Yet here again we may find life and beauty in the passage, if only"
17142,SECT. IV.,we construe it of a cloud illuminated by the rays falling on it.
17143,SECT. IV.,"Indeed, generally the element of light brings us back to Homer’s usual"
17144,SECT. IV.,"definiteness, when his use of colour makes him obscure."
17145,SECT. IV.,
17146,SECT. IV.,"2. Again, in the numerous and very exact epithets by which the Poet has"
17147,SECT. IV.,"described the form and appearance of different countries, we scarcely"
17148,SECT. IV.,find any epithet of colour. Out of about sixty of these epithets in the
17149,SECT. IV.,"Greek Catalogue, there are but three that refer to colour, and these"
17150,SECT. IV.,"all mention whiteness only (ἀργινόεις, Il. ii. 647, 656, and λευκός,"
17151,SECT. IV.,ibid. 735).
17152,SECT. IV.,
17153,SECT. IV.,~_In the case of the horse._~
17154,SECT. IV.,
17155,SECT. IV.,"3. It is most singular that, though Homer so loved the horse that he"
17156,SECT. IV.,is never weary of using him with his whole heart for the purposes of
17157,SECT. IV.,"poetry, yet in all his animated and beautiful descriptions of this"
17158,SECT. IV.,"animal, colour should be so little prominent. It is said, indeed, that"
17159,SECT. IV.,Homer tells us the horses of Eumelus corresponded in colour (ὅτριχες
17160,SECT. IV.,Il. ii. 765); but what the colour was we know not; and the question may
17161,SECT. IV.,"also be raised, whether the epithet employed does not more properly"
17162,SECT. IV.,indicate similarity in the fineness of their coat. Perhaps the only
17163,SECT. IV.,"cases, where colour is distinctly assigned to horses, are the following"
17164,SECT. IV.,two:
17165,SECT. IV.,
17166,SECT. IV.,"First, that of the horses of Rhesus. There the colour is the negative"
17167,SECT. IV.,"one of whiteness, which seems, with its counterpart blackness, to have"
17168,SECT. IV.,been so much more present to the mind of Homer than any intermediate
17169,SECT. IV.,colour. These horses were (Il. x. 437) λευκότεροι χιόνος. And
17170,SECT. IV.,"afterwards Nestor in a noble line declares them like, not to anything"
17171,SECT. IV.,"having colour, but to the rays of the sun (Il. x. 547). Thus reappears"
17172,SECT. IV.,"the old identification in Homer’s mind of light and colour. There is,"
17173,SECT. IV.,"however, another reason to which it may be suspected that we owe the"
17174,SECT. IV.,"mention of colour in this instance: namely, that the whiteness is"
17175,SECT. IV.,"intended to make them visible in the gloom, and thus to assist the"
17176,SECT. IV.,capture by night.
17177,SECT. IV.,
17178,SECT. IV.,"The second case is, that of the horse of Diomed in the chariot-race."
17179,SECT. IV.,Here Idomeneus mentions the bay or chestnut colour (Il. xxiii. 454)
17180,SECT. IV.,"with the white mark, but then it is the only means of identifying the"
17181,SECT. IV.,"master, which is essential to his purpose in the speech. Apart from"
17182,SECT. IV.,"these special reasons, Homer speaks indeed twice of the ξανθὰ κάρηνα"
17183,SECT. IV.,"of horses; this, however, is of horses in the abstract. Nestor (Il. xi."
17184,SECT. IV.,"680) mentions a set of one hundred and fifty mares all with colour,"
17185,SECT. IV.,"that is to say, ξανθαί: a new proof of the lax use of the word, as they"
17186,SECT. IV.,would hardly be all alike.
17187,SECT. IV.,
17188,SECT. IV.,"Among the four horses of Hector (Il. viii. 185), the two of the Atreidæ"
17189,SECT. IV.,"(Il. xxiii. 295), and the three of Achilles (xvi. 475) we find only the"
17190,SECT. IV.,name Xanthus which is clearly referable to colour: and this is in truth
17191,SECT. IV.,"the only colour which, besides white, he ever gives to his horses. For"
17192,SECT. IV.,it is more probable that by the name Βάλιος he meant to refer to the
17193,SECT. IV.,"effect of light from rapidity of motion: while Αἴθη in Il. xxiii. 409,"
17194,SECT. IV.,Αἴθων and Λάμπος (Il. viii. 485) may signify brightness or darkness
17195,SECT. IV.,"indeed, but neither of these is colour."
17196,SECT. IV.,
17197,SECT. IV.,"Again, in the magnificent simile of the στάτος ἵππος there is no"
17198,SECT. IV.,colour. The three thousand horses of Erichthonius (Il. x. 221) have
17199,SECT. IV.,no colour. The horses of Diomed (Il. v. 257) have none. Nor have the
17200,SECT. IV.,"heaven-born horses of Tros, nor those which Anchises bred from them"
17201,SECT. IV.,(Il. v. 265. _et seqq._). None of the teams for the race in Il. xxiii.
17202,SECT. IV.,have colour. Lastly; Homer abounds in characteristic and set epithets
17203,SECT. IV.,"for horses, such as ὠκὺς, ὠκύπους, ποδώκης, μώνυξ, ἐριαύχην, ἀερσίπους,"
17204,SECT. IV.,"ἐΰσκαρθμος, ὑψήχης, καλλίθριξ, ταχὺς, and others; but none of them are"
17205,SECT. IV.,taken from colour.
17206,SECT. IV.,
17207,SECT. IV.,"Yet colour is in horses a thing so prominent that it seems, wherever"
17208,SECT. IV.,"they are at all individualized, almost to force itself into the"
17209,SECT. IV.,"description. Let us take two examples allied in their beauty, although"
17210,SECT. IV.,separated in birth by twenty-two hundred years. The first is from
17211,SECT. IV.,"Euripides, where the Chorus in _Iphigenia in Aulide_ describes the"
17212,SECT. IV.,Grecian host before embarcation[847].
17213,SECT. IV.,
17214,SECT. IV.,[847] Eurip. Iph. in Aul. 213-22.
17215,SECT. IV.,
17216,SECT. IV.,ὁ δὲ διφρηλάτας βοᾶτ’

17225,SECT. IV.,ποικιλοδέρμονας.
17226,SECT. IV.,
17227,SECT. IV.,"The second, also eminently beautiful, is from Macaulay, where in the"
17228,SECT. IV.,"‘Battle of the Lake Regillus’, after the deadly conflict of Mamilius"
17229,SECT. IV.,"and Herminius, he describes what then happened to their steeds."
17230,SECT. IV.,
17231,SECT. IV.,"Fast, fast, with heels wild spurning,"
17232,SECT. IV.,The _dark-grey_ charger fled;
17233,SECT. IV.,"He burst through ranks of fighting men,"
17234,SECT. IV.,He sprang o’er heaps of dead....
17235,SECT. IV.,
17236,SECT. IV.,But like a graven image
17237,SECT. IV.,"_Black_ Auster kept his place,"
17238,SECT. IV.,And ever wistfully he looked
17239,SECT. IV.,Into his master’s face.
17240,SECT. IV.,
17241,SECT. IV.,How characteristically the element of colour enters into these
17242,SECT. IV.,admirable descriptions.
17243,SECT. IV.,
17244,SECT. IV.,"4. It is not, however, the case of the horse alone, on which an"
17245,SECT. IV.,"argument may be founded. Homer abounds with notices of other animals,"
17246,SECT. IV.,"both domesticated and wild. We have oxen, dogs, goats, hogs, and sheep."
17247,SECT. IV.,None of his stock epithets for them are drawn from colour; and we have
17248,SECT. IV.,"seen that by his wine-coloured oxen, and his violet-coloured sheep, he,"
17249,SECT. IV.,"in all likelihood, means no more than dark or tawny. His epithets for"
17250,SECT. IV.,"wild animals are of the same character when they occur, and similarly"
17251,SECT. IV.,"depend on the scale of degrees between light and darkness, not upon"
17252,SECT. IV.,colour. Once he mentions a white goose (Od. xv. 161); but it is borne
17253,SECT. IV.,"on high in the talons of an eagle, and the object evidently is to"
17254,SECT. IV.,create a clear visual image.
17255,SECT. IV.,
17256,SECT. IV.,"5. I would not lay overmuch stress on the fact, that Homer never refers"
17257,SECT. IV.,"to colour in connection with the human frame, unless as regards the"
17258,SECT. IV.,"hair, which is either ξανθὸς or κυάνεος: expressions which, as we"
17259,SECT. IV.,"shall see, are apparent exceptions, and not real ones. The olive hue"
17260,SECT. IV.,of the Mediterranean latitudes makes colour a less prominent element
17261,SECT. IV.,"in human beauty for a Greek climate, than it is for ours. Still its"
17262,SECT. IV.,almost entire exclusion is an element in the case. One instance that
17263,SECT. IV.,"I have noticed, which introduces it, adds to the general mass of"
17264,SECT. IV.,"testimony. When Minerva (Od. xvi. 175) restores the beauty of Ulysses,"
17265,SECT. IV.,the expression is ἂψ δὲ μελαγχροιὴς γένετο. Now this certainly does not
17266,SECT. IV.,mean that his flesh became black again. It can only signify that he
17267,SECT. IV.,"resumed the olive tint, which was associated with personal vigour and"
17268,SECT. IV.,"beauty. So that even the μέλας of Homer means dark, and is indefinite:"
17269,SECT. IV.,as might indeed be shown by many other instances.
17270,SECT. IV.,
17271,SECT. IV.,"6. Lastly, it seems to deserve remark, that there is not one single"
17272,SECT. IV.,"epithet of Iris taken from colour. She is once, and only once,"
17273,SECT. IV.,"χρυσόπτερος (Il. viii. 398); but this is in virtue of her office, and"
17274,SECT. IV.,"has no relation to the rainbow; as, indeed, gold with Homer always"
17275,SECT. IV.,"belongs to light rather than to colour. All her other epithets, without"
17276,SECT. IV.,"exception, are taken from motion only. She is swift (ὠκέα and τάχεια),"
17277,SECT. IV.,"swift of foot (πόδας ὠκέα), swift as the wind (ποδήνεμος), storm-footed"
17278,SECT. IV.,"(ἀελλόπους[848]), but from colour she derives no part whatever of her"
17279,SECT. IV.,Homeric costume. Now though the chain of traditions which identified
17280,SECT. IV.,"Iris with the rainbow was broken[849], yet the traces of it were not"
17281,SECT. IV.,"wholly lost. For Homer treated the rainbow, physically, as a prophet"
17282,SECT. IV.,"of storm (Il. xvii. 548): and again, we find that she was still"
17283,SECT. IV.,tempest-footed. This epithet can only be derived from her original
17284,SECT. IV.,"relation to the rainbow. It is therefore highly instructive, that none"
17285,SECT. IV.,of her traits of colour should have been preserved.
17286,SECT. IV.,
17287,SECT. IV.,[848] Il. xviii. 409. xxiv. 159.
17288,SECT. IV.,
17289,SECT. IV.,"[849] See Olympus, sect. ii. p. 157."
17290,SECT. IV.,
17291,SECT. IV.,"Lastly, let us take the case of the sky, or the heavens. Here Homer"
17292,SECT. IV.,had before him the most perfect example of blue. Yet he never once so
17293,SECT. IV.,"describes the sky. His οὐρανὸς is starry (Il. i. 317), or broad (Il."
17294,SECT. IV.,"iii. 364), or great (Il. i. 497), or iron (Od. xv. 328), or copper (Od."
17295,SECT. IV.,iii. 2. Il. xvii. 425); but it is never blue. This is an important
17296,SECT. IV.,piece of negative testimony.
17297,SECT. IV.,
17298,SECT. IV.,"We have now before us a pretty large, though I by no means venture to"
17299,SECT. IV.,"suppose it a complete, collection of the facts of the case."
17300,SECT. IV.,
17301,SECT. IV.,~_Causes of this peculiar treatment._~
17302,SECT. IV.,
17303,SECT. IV.,I submit that they warrant the two following propositions:
17304,SECT. IV.,
17305,SECT. IV.,"1. That Homer’s perceptions of the prismatic colours, or colours of the"
17306,SECT. IV.,"rainbow, which depend on the decomposition of light by refraction, and"
17307,SECT. IV.,"_a fortiori_ of their compounds, were, as a general rule, vague and"
17308,SECT. IV.,indeterminate.
17309,SECT. IV.,
17310,SECT. IV.,2. That we must therefore seek another basis for his system of colour.
17311,SECT. IV.,
17312,SECT. IV.,But a few words may be permitted on the cause which has led to his
17313,SECT. IV.,treatment of the subject in a manner so different from that of the
17314,SECT. IV.,moderns.
17315,SECT. IV.,
17316,SECT. IV.,Are we justified in referring it to his reputed blindness?
17317,SECT. IV.,
17318,SECT. IV.,"Are we to suppose a defect in his organization, or in that of his"
17319,SECT. IV.,countrymen?
17320,SECT. IV.,
17321,SECT. IV.,"Or are we to reject altogether the idea of defect, and to treat his"
17322,SECT. IV.,"use of colour as one conceived in the spirit which, with even the most"
17323,SECT. IV.,"perfect knowledge, would properly belong to his art?"
17324,SECT. IV.,
17325,SECT. IV.,The mere tradition of Homer’s blindness is hardly relevant. The
17326,SECT. IV.,"presumption of it drawn from the poems, because they make Demodocus"
17327,SECT. IV.,"blind, is inappreciably minute. The testimony of the Hymn to Apollo is"
17328,SECT. IV.,"ancient[850]; but, as his blindness (if he really was blind) allowed"
17329,SECT. IV.,"of the most vivid conceptions of light, it will not account for"
17330,SECT. IV.,defectiveness in his conceptions of colour. The vigorous apprehension
17331,SECT. IV.,"and accurate description of sensible objects in the poems demonstrate,"
17332,SECT. IV.,that we cannot seek in this hypothesis for an explanation of what may
17333,SECT. IV.,"be either singular, crude, or irregular."
17334,SECT. IV.,
17335,SECT. IV.,[850] Hymn. ad Apoll. v. 172.
17336,SECT. IV.,
17337,SECT. IV.,"Neither can we resort to the supposition of anything, that is to be"
17338,SECT. IV.,properly called a defect in his organization; when we bear in mind
17339,SECT. IV.,"his intense feeling for form, and when we observe his effective and"
17340,SECT. IV.,powerful handling of the ideas of light and dark.
17341,SECT. IV.,
17342,SECT. IV.,~_License of Poetry as to colour._~
17343,SECT. IV.,
17344,SECT. IV.,"Our answer to the third question must also, I think, be in the"
17345,SECT. IV.,"negative. It is true, indeed, that much of merely literal discrepancy"
17346,SECT. IV.,as to colour might be understood to appertain to the license of poetry.
17347,SECT. IV.,There is high poetical effect in what may be called straining epithets
17348,SECT. IV.,"of colour. But it seems essential to that effect,"
17349,SECT. IV.,
17350,SECT. IV.,"(1.) That the straining should be the exception, and not the rule."
17351,SECT. IV.,
17352,SECT. IV.,"(2.) That there should be a fixed standard of the colour itself, so"
17353,SECT. IV.,that the departures from it may be measured. Otherwise the result is
17354,SECT. IV.,"not license, but confusion. Shakespeare with high effect says[851],"
17355,SECT. IV.,
17356,SECT. IV.,[851] Macbeth ii. 3.
17357,SECT. IV.,
17358,SECT. IV.,"Here lay Duncan,"
17359,SECT. IV.,His silver skin laced with his golden blood.
17360,SECT. IV.,
17361,SECT. IV.,"Here the idea is not that silver is of the same colour as skin, nor"
17362,SECT. IV.,gold as blood; but that the relation of colour between silver and gold
17363,SECT. IV.,may be compared with that between skin and blood: the skin throws the
17364,SECT. IV.,"blood into relief, as a ground of silver would throw out a projection"
17365,SECT. IV.,of gold. In license of this kind we can always trace both a rule and an
17366,SECT. IV.,aim. The rule is relaxed only for the particular occasion. The effect
17367,SECT. IV.,"produced is that of tenderness, dignity, and purity. Had Shakespeare"
17368,SECT. IV.,"been describing the horrible carnage of a battlefield, he probably"
17369,SECT. IV.,would have spoken of black or foul gore instead of using a brightening
17370,SECT. IV.,figure.
17371,SECT. IV.,
17372,SECT. IV.,"Now this purpose is not traceable in Homer’s use of certain words, if"
17373,SECT. IV.,we are required to treat them as adjectives of colour. There is no
17374,SECT. IV.,"Poet, whose _rationale_ is commonly more accessible; but these cases,"
17375,SECT. IV.,"upon such a principle, do not admit of a _rationale_ at all."
17376,SECT. IV.,
17377,SECT. IV.,"Take for instance his use of the rainbow. It is (1) πορφυρέη, and (2)"
17378,SECT. IV.,"like a δράκων, which is κυάνεος. Of these, the first may be construed"
17379,SECT. IV.,"dark with a hue of crimson; the second, dark with a hue of deep blue or"
17380,SECT. IV.,"indigo. Surely we have here, viewing it as a whole, a most inadequate"
17381,SECT. IV.,"treatment of the colours of the rainbow. Shakespeare indeed says[852],"
17382,SECT. IV.,
17383,SECT. IV.,"[852] Troilus and Cressida, i. 3, _sub_ fin."
17384,SECT. IV.,
17385,SECT. IV.,"His crest, that prouder than blue Iris bends;"
17386,SECT. IV.,
17387,SECT. IV.,"and again, in the Tempest, Ceres addresses Iris thus[853];"
17388,SECT. IV.,
17389,SECT. IV.,"[853] Tempest, iv. 1. The rainbow is mentioned as of many colours, in"
17390,SECT. IV.,"Merry Wives of Windsor, iv. 5, Winter’s Tale, iv. 3, and King John, iv."
17391,SECT. IV.,2.
17392,SECT. IV.,
17393,SECT. IV.,And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown
17394,SECT. IV.,My bosky acres....
17395,SECT. IV.,
17396,SECT. IV.,"But (1) blue differs from πορφύρεος, which is essentially dark, and"
17397,SECT. IV.,"is not blue. (2) Blue, taken largely, represents three of the seven"
17398,SECT. IV.,prismatic colours: i. e. indigo and purple along with itself. (3) In
17399,SECT. IV.,"the last quoted passage, Iris is also called ‘many-coloured messenger,’"
17400,SECT. IV.,and with ‘saffron wings.’ How different an effect do these words
17401,SECT. IV.,"give, as they form a whole, from that of the simile in Il. xvii. In"
17402,SECT. IV.,"what manner then are we to understand Homer? I answer, in the way"
17403,SECT. IV.,"of metaphor; and with reference to light and dark, not to prismatic"
17404,SECT. IV.,colour. The δράκοντες on the buckler and belt are dark and terrible:
17405,SECT. IV.,"so is the storm of which Iris is the type, and it is in viewing the"
17406,SECT. IV.,"rainbow as a type of what is awful, that we are to find the reason of"
17407,SECT. IV.,"Homer’s simply treating it as dark, and not as a series and system of"
17408,SECT. IV.,colours. Perhaps we ought not to overlook the possibility that Homer
17409,SECT. IV.,may also mean to compare the shifting hues of the serpent with the
17410,SECT. IV.,varied appearance of the rainbow.
17411,SECT. IV.,
17412,SECT. IV.,"Again, let us take his use of μελαγχροίης. Now the question is, did"
17413,SECT. IV.,"Homer mean by this simply to express darkness, that is to say was"
17414,SECT. IV.,"_dark_ his idea of μέλας, or did he, with the specific idea of black"
17415,SECT. IV.,"in his mind, use the term which denoted it poetically for the olive"
17416,SECT. IV.,complexion of Ulysses? Surely the former: for the latter use of it
17417,SECT. IV.,would have been bad. It would have been straining the figure in the
17418,SECT. IV.,wrong direction. For blackness would be a fitting trope only where the
17419,SECT. IV.,object was to describe something awful or repulsive.
17420,SECT. IV.,
17421,SECT. IV.,But beauty of form in Homer always leans to light hues and not to dark
17422,SECT. IV.,"ones, whence the Greeks are ξανθοὶ, and the Trojan Hector, though"
17423,SECT. IV.,"beautiful, is κυάνεος only. Therefore it was not Homer’s object to give"
17424,SECT. IV.,"an enhanced idea of darkness in the tints of Ulysses. And yet, if μέλας"
17425,SECT. IV.,"for him meant specifically black, then μελαγχροίης was the height of"
17426,SECT. IV.,exaggeration in the wrong sense. But if by μέλας he only understood
17427,SECT. IV.,"dark, that was a fair description of the olive tint, as compared with"
17428,SECT. IV.,the withered and shrivelled skin of old age.
17429,SECT. IV.,
17430,SECT. IV.,We have other proofs from the poems that Homer conceived of μέλας as
17431,SECT. IV.,"dark, and not specifically as black. The former idea accords best with"
17432,SECT. IV.,"his calling earth μέλας, when it is fresh behind the plough (Il. xviii."
17433,SECT. IV.,"548): and his calling blood μέλας, not stagnant gore, but blood fresh"
17434,SECT. IV.,"as it comes spurting from the wound (Il. i. 303),"
17435,SECT. IV.,
17436,SECT. IV.,αἶψά τοι αἷμα κελαινὸν ἐρωήσει περὶ δουρί·
17437,SECT. IV.,
17438,SECT. IV.,"and again, the fresh blood of Venus herself: μελαίνετο δὲ χρόα καλόν"
17439,SECT. IV.,(Il. v. 354). It would be bad poetry to call the blood of Venus
17440,SECT. IV.,"_black_, for the same reasons which make it good poetry in Shakespeare"
17441,SECT. IV.,to call the blood of Duncan golden. So the μέλας πόντος of Il. xxiv. 79
17442,SECT. IV.,is evidently no more than dark; though in vii. 64 we may properly say
17443,SECT. IV.,the sea blackens.
17444,SECT. IV.,
17445,SECT. IV.,"So again with wine-coloured oxen, smutty thunder-bolts, violet-coloured"
17446,SECT. IV.,"sheep, and many more, it is surely conclusive against taking them for"
17447,SECT. IV.,"descriptions of prismatic colours or their compounds, that they would"
17448,SECT. IV.,be bad descriptions in their several kinds.
17449,SECT. IV.,
17450,SECT. IV.,~_Homer’s means of training in colour._~
17451,SECT. IV.,
17452,SECT. IV.,We must then seek for the basis of Homer’s system with respect to
17453,SECT. IV.,colour in something outside our own. And it may prepare us the more
17454,SECT. IV.,"readily to acknowledge such a basis elsewhere, if we bear in mind,"
17455,SECT. IV.,that many of the great elements and sources of colour for us presented
17456,SECT. IV.,themselves differently to him. The olive hue of the skin kept down the
17457,SECT. IV.,"play of white and red. The hair tended much more uniformly, than with"
17458,SECT. IV.,"us, to darkness. The sense of colour was less exercised by the culture"
17459,SECT. IV.,of flowers. The sun sooner changed the spring-greens of the earth into
17460,SECT. IV.,"brown. Glass, one of our instruments of instruction, did not exist. The"
17461,SECT. IV.,rainbow would much more rarely meet the view. The art of painting was
17462,SECT. IV.,"wholly, and that of dyeing was almost, unknown; and we may estimate"
17463,SECT. IV.,"the importance of this element of the case by recollecting how much,"
17464,SECT. IV.,"with the advance of chemistry, the taste of this country in colour has"
17465,SECT. IV.,"improved within the last twenty years. The artificial colours, with"
17466,SECT. IV.,"which the human eye was conversant, were chiefly the ill-defined, and"
17467,SECT. IV.,"anything but full-bodied, tints of metals. The materials, therefore,"
17468,SECT. IV.,for a system of colour did not offer themselves to Homer’s vision as
17469,SECT. IV.,they do to ours. Particular colours were indeed exhibited in rare
17470,SECT. IV.,"beauty, as the blue of the sea and of the sky. Yet these colours were,"
17471,SECT. IV.,"so to speak, isolated fragments; and, not entering into a general"
17472,SECT. IV.,"scheme, they were apparently not conceived with the precision necessary"
17473,SECT. IV.,to master them. It seems easy to comprehend that the eye may require a
17474,SECT. IV.,"familiarity with an ordered system of colours, as the condition of its"
17475,SECT. IV.,being able closely to appreciate any one among them.
17476,SECT. IV.,
17477,SECT. IV.,"I conclude, then, that the organ of colour and its impressions were but"
17478,SECT. IV.,partially developed among the Greeks of the heroic age.
17479,SECT. IV.,
17480,SECT. IV.,"In lieu of this, Homer seems to have had, firstly some crude"
17481,SECT. IV.,conceptions of colour derived from the elements; secondly and
17482,SECT. IV.,"principally, a system in lieu of colour, founded upon light and upon"
17483,SECT. IV.,"darkness, its opposite or negative. We have seen that the μέλας of"
17484,SECT. IV.,"Homer, which is applied to fine olive tints in the skin, and which"
17485,SECT. IV.,"joins hands with κυάνεος and πορφύρεος, means dark, the absence of"
17486,SECT. IV.,"light. On the other hand, the basis of whiteness is clearly indicated"
17487,SECT. IV.,"to us in the etymology of λευκὸς, which is the same as that of λεύσσω"
17488,SECT. IV.,"to see, and of λύκη light in λυκαβὰς the year, the walk or course of"
17489,SECT. IV.,"light; as well as in the cognate words, which appear to have their"
17490,SECT. IV.,"root in the Sanscrit _loch_, from whence _lochan_, an eye[854]."

17496,SECT. IV.,"As a general proposition, then, I should say that the Homeric colours"
17497,SECT. IV.,"are really the modes and forms of light[855], and of its opposite or"
17498,SECT. IV.,"rather negative, darkness: partially affected perhaps by ideas drawn"
17499,SECT. IV.,"from the metals, like the ruddiness of copper, or the sombre and dead"
17500,SECT. IV.,"blue of κύανος, whatever the substance may have been; and here and"
17501,SECT. IV.,"there with an inceptive effort, as it were, to get hold of other ideas"
17502,SECT. IV.,of colour.

17506,SECT. IV.,
17507,SECT. IV.,"Under the application of this principle, I believe that all, or nearly"
17508,SECT. IV.,"all, the Homeric words will fall into their places: and that we shall"
17509,SECT. IV.,"find that the Poet used them, from his own standing-ground, with great"
17510,SECT. IV.,vigour and effect. We can now see why λευκὸς and μέλας with their
17511,SECT. IV.,kindred words have such an immense predominance: though white and black
17512,SECT. IV.,"are the limiting ratios of colour, rather than colour itself."
17513,SECT. IV.,
17514,SECT. IV.,"Of the transparent and opaque, or _chiaroscuro_, we cannot expect to"
17515,SECT. IV.,"hear from Homer: yet, as has been observed, a rudiment of it may be"
17516,SECT. IV.,contained in the highly poetical ἠεροειδὲς of the cave or sea; and
17517,SECT. IV.,"again in the δνοφερὴ νὺξ (Od. xiii. 269), since νέφος is the basis of"
17518,SECT. IV.,the epithet.
17519,SECT. IV.,
17520,SECT. IV.,"When we speak of colour proper, we speak of an effect which is produced"
17521,SECT. IV.,"by the decomposition of light, and which, so long as the eye can"
17522,SECT. IV.,"discharge its function, is complete, whatever the quantity, or the"
17523,SECT. IV.,"incidence, of light upon the object said to have colour may happen to"
17524,SECT. IV.,be.
17525,SECT. IV.,
17526,SECT. IV.,"When we speak of light, shade, and darkness, we refer to the quantity"
17527,SECT. IV.,"of light, not decomposed, which falls upon that object, and to the mode"
17528,SECT. IV.,of its incidence.
17529,SECT. IV.,
17530,SECT. IV.,"Of light, shadow, and darkness thus regarded, Homer had lively and"
17531,SECT. IV.,most poetical conceptions. This description of objects by light and its
17532,SECT. IV.,"absence tax his materials to the uttermost. His iron-grey, his ruddy,"
17533,SECT. IV.,"his starry heaven, are so many modes of light. His wine-coloured oxen"
17534,SECT. IV.,"and sea, his violet sheep, his things tawny, purple, sooty, and the"
17535,SECT. IV.,"rest, give us in fact a rich vocabulary of words for describing what"
17536,SECT. IV.,"is dark so far as it has colour, but what also varies between dull and"
17537,SECT. IV.,"bright, according to the quantity of light playing upon it. Here (for"
17538,SECT. IV.,example) is the link between his αἴθοψ κάπνος and his αἴθοψ οἶνος.
17539,SECT. IV.,
17540,SECT. IV.,"As these words all follow in the train, so to speak, of μέλας, even so"
17541,SECT. IV.,"λευκὸς is attended by its own family, all falling under the meaning of"
17542,SECT. IV.,the English adjective _light_. On the one hand χλωρὸς and πόλιος; on
17543,SECT. IV.,"the other μαρμάρεος, ἀργὸς, and σιγαλόεις, all mean _light_; but the"
17544,SECT. IV.,"first two are dull, and represent the twilight of colour, or debateable"
17545,SECT. IV.,"ground between it and its negative, while the last three are bright and"
17546,SECT. IV.,glistering.
17547,SECT. IV.,
17548,SECT. IV.,Nothing can be more poetical than Homer’s ideas of dark and light. It
17549,SECT. IV.,"was a redundancy of life in these ideas, that made him associate light"
17550,SECT. IV.,"with motion; as in those fine lines (Il. ii. 437),"
17551,SECT. IV.,
17552,SECT. IV.,ὣς τῶν ἐρχομένων ἀπὸ χαλκοῦ θεσπεσίοιο
17553,SECT. IV.,αἴγλη παμφανόωσα δι’ αἰθέρος οὐρανὸν ἷκεν.

17556,SECT. IV.,
17557,SECT. IV.,"αἴγλη δ’ οὐρανὸν ἷκε, γέλασσε δὲ πᾶσα περὶ χθών."
17558,SECT. IV.,
17559,SECT. IV.,"So, on the other hand, the idea of darkness went to animate"
17560,SECT. IV.,"metaphysical conceptions, as in black fate, black death, black clouds"
17561,SECT. IV.,"of death, black pains (Il. ii. 859, 834. xvi. 350. iv. 117)."
17562,SECT. IV.,
17563,SECT. IV.,"Naturalists tell us, that there exist kinds of creatures respecting"
17564,SECT. IV.,"which it is known, that their organs are sensitive to light and"
17565,SECT. IV.,"darkness, but with no perception whatever either of colour or of"
17566,SECT. IV.,"form[856]. So far as respects form, Homer perceived keenly such forms"
17567,SECT. IV.,as were beautiful: but of mere geometrical form he may have had very
17568,SECT. IV.,"indistinct ideas, if we are to judge from his epithets for the form of"
17569,SECT. IV.,a shield. The parallel is nearer in the case of colour; for even his
17570,SECT. IV.,"perceptions were as yet undigested; as if they were novel, not aided by"
17571,SECT. IV.,"tradition, acquired very much by himself, and fixed as yet neither by"
17572,SECT. IV.,custom nor nomenclature.

17580,SECT. IV.,that heroic Greece may probably have been far behind some countries of

17588,SECT. IV.,
17589,SECT. IV.,"The tendency, however, to a mixture of the two questions of light and"
17590,SECT. IV.,"colour appears to be traceable more or less in the popular language,"
17591,SECT. IV.,"and likewise in the philosophy, of the later Greeks."
17592,SECT. IV.,
17593,SECT. IV.,"In the classical period, the hues of the eye were divided, as μέλας the"
17594,SECT. IV.,"darkest, χάροπος the intermediate, and γλαυκὸς the lightest."
17595,SECT. IV.,
17596,SECT. IV.,"The word πράσινος, leek-green, appears to be quite adequate to the"
17597,SECT. IV.,expression of the colour. It is used by Aristotle; but I do not know
17598,SECT. IV.,that it is found in the poets or writers of the best age. For the
17599,SECT. IV.,"classical Greek the idea of greenness is expressed by χλωρὸς, as"
17600,SECT. IV.,far as it is expressed at all. Now this word seems inadequate on two
17601,SECT. IV.,"grounds. First, its predominant idea is that of ‘fresh’ or ‘recent;’"
17602,SECT. IV.,"which is but accidentally, and not invariably, the property of those"
17603,SECT. IV.,objects in nature that are green.
17604,SECT. IV.,
17605,SECT. IV.,When we find the word χλωρὸς applied alike to objects of a green
17606,SECT. IV.,"colour, and to others that have no colour, (or else not in respect of"
17607,SECT. IV.,"their colour,) but yet which are fresh or newly sprung, we are led to"
17608,SECT. IV.,"conclude that it was for freshness, and not for greenness, that the"
17609,SECT. IV.,word was generally used. This idea is confirmed by two circumstances.
17610,SECT. IV.,"First, that when χλωρὸς does signify colour, as in the case of"
17611,SECT. IV.,"paleness, (where it cannot mean what is fresh,) it signifies the most"
17612,SECT. IV.,"indefinite and feeble colour, little more indeed than a negative."
17613,SECT. IV.,
17614,SECT. IV.,The meaning of χλωρὸν δεός is probably ashy-pale fear. In the green of
17615,SECT. IV.,the olive we see the point of connection between this use of the term
17616,SECT. IV.,"on the one hand, and natural verdure on the other. So that the image of"
17617,SECT. IV.,"the colour green, to the Greeks, was neither lively and bright on the"
17618,SECT. IV.,"one hand, nor was it strong and deep on the other."
17619,SECT. IV.,
17620,SECT. IV.,The second circumstance is this: that the word χλωρὸς is applied by the
17621,SECT. IV.,"later Greeks to objects that have a colour, but a colour which is _not_"
17622,SECT. IV.,"green: and this by authors who had the full use of sight. Thus, in"
17623,SECT. IV.,"Euripides, (Hecuba 124,) we have αἵματι χλωρῷ for blood freshly shed."
17624,SECT. IV.,"It seems plain that, when the epithet could be thus used, colour could"
17625,SECT. IV.,only be very carelessly and faintly conceived in the minds either of
17626,SECT. IV.,"those who used the expression, or of those to whom it was addressed."
17627,SECT. IV.,
17628,SECT. IV.,I shall not open the general subject of the treatment of colour by the
17629,SECT. IV.,"later Greeks, or by the Latin poets. But that it continued to be both"
17630,SECT. IV.,"faint and indefinite down to a very late period, and in a degree which"
17631,SECT. IV.,"would now be deemed very surprising, we may judge both from the general"
17632,SECT. IV.,"tenour of the Æneid, and from the remarkable verse of Albinovanus, an"
17633,SECT. IV.,"Augustan poet, which applied the epithet ‘purpureus’ to snow;"

17636,SECT. IV.,
17637,SECT. IV.,"Neither do I enter into the question, whether the shadows of white"

17722,SECT. IV.,explaining to us the undeveloped state of Homer’s perceptions in this
17723,SECT. IV.,particular department.
17724,SECT. IV.,
17725,SECT. IV.,There appears to be a remarkable contrast between such undigested
17726,SECT. IV.,"ideas, and the solidity, truth, and firmness of the remains of colour"
17727,SECT. IV.,"that have come down to us from the ancients. The explanation, I"
17728,SECT. IV.,"suppose, is, that those, who had to make practical use of colour, did"
17729,SECT. IV.,"not wait for the construction of a philosophy, but added to their"
17730,SECT. IV.,"apparatus from time to time all substances which, having come within"
17731,SECT. IV.,"their knowledge, were found to produce results satisfactory and"
17732,SECT. IV.,"improving to the eye. And even so Homer, though his organ was little"
17733,SECT. IV.,"trained in the discrimination of colours, and though he founded himself"
17734,SECT. IV.,"mainly upon mere modifications of light apart from its decomposition,"
17735,SECT. IV.,yet has made very bold and effective use of these limited materials.
17736,SECT. IV.,"His figures in no case jar, while they never fail to strike. Nor are"

17739,SECT. IV.,"and that he bore, in the particular point, a crippled nature; but"
17740,SECT. IV.,rather we are to learn that the perceptions so easy and familiar to
17741,SECT. IV.,us are the results of a slow traditionary growth in knowledge and in
17742,SECT. IV.,"the training of the human organ, which commenced long before we took"
17743,SECT. IV.,"our place in the succession of mankind. We exemplify, even in this"

17749,SECT. IV.,
17750,SECT. IV.,The first impression from the Homeric text is likely to be that
17751,SECT. IV.,κύανος is a metal. For the substantive is mentioned but thrice in
17752,SECT. IV.,Homer; and always in immediate connection with metals.

17755,SECT. IV.,"οἶμοι, folds, rims, or plies, of gold, and twenty of tin, ten of"

17758,SECT. IV.,"2. Il. xi. 34. On the shield of the king, there were twenty white"

17763,SECT. IV.,(θριγκὸς) of κύανος.
17764,SECT. IV.,
17765,SECT. IV.,"There is no doubt that, in later Greek at least, the word acquired"
17766,SECT. IV.,"other significations: such as _lapis lazuli_, the blue cornflower,"
17767,SECT. IV.,"the rockbird (also as being blue), and, lastly, a blue dye or"
17768,SECT. IV.,"lacquer[867]. But, moreover, it seems impossible to identify the"
17769,SECT. IV.,κύανος of Homer with any metal in particular.

17773,SECT. IV.,
17774,SECT. IV.,Some have asserted the κύανος of Homer to be steel[868]. But to this
17775,SECT. IV.,"there seem to be conclusive objections. It appears very doubtful,"
17776,SECT. IV.,whether the Greeks were acquainted with the process of making steel
17777,SECT. IV.,in masses by the immersion of iron in water. The English translation
17778,SECT. IV.,of Beckmann’s History of Inventions ascribes the knowledge of the
17779,SECT. IV.,process to Homer; but apparently in error[869]. There is no allusion
17780,SECT. IV.,whatever to it: for it is not at all implied by the elementary
17781,SECT. IV.,process of the manufacture of a tool in Od ix. 391-3. It was only
17782,SECT. IV.,by fire that iron could be made malleable at all: and no doubt it
17783,SECT. IV.,was known that by its immersion in water hardness was restored or
17784,SECT. IV.,increased (τὸ γὰρ αὖτε σιδήρου γε κράτος ἐστίν). But we have no
17785,SECT. IV.,trace either of the repetition of the process on the same piece of
17786,SECT. IV.,"metal, or of its application to unmanufactured iron, or of a new"
17787,SECT. IV.,"denomination for iron when thus heated and cooled. On the contrary,"
17788,SECT. IV.,in this passage the metal when fully hardened is still declared to be
17789,SECT. IV.,σίδηρος: and we have nowhere in Homer any trace of a relation between
17790,SECT. IV.,"κύανος and σίδηρος, except the merely negative one, that neither of"
17791,SECT. IV.,them is cast into the furnace for making the Shield of Achilles.

17796,SECT. IV.,
17797,SECT. IV.,"Again, the hardness of iron was such as apparently met all their"
17798,SECT. IV.,"wishes, and almost of itself constituted a difficulty. Hence it is"
17799,SECT. IV.,used along with stones as a symbol of hardness; ἐπεὶ οὔ σφι λίθος
17800,SECT. IV.,"χρὼς ἠὲ σίδηρος[870]. Again, we do not find it worked up with other"
17801,SECT. IV.,"metals; for example, on the buckler or shield of Agamemnon. As we"
17802,SECT. IV.,"have seen, it is not used by Vulcan in making the shield of Achilles."
17803,SECT. IV.,"The god casts into the fire gold and silver, copper and tin; lead"
17804,SECT. IV.,"being apparently excluded as too soft, and iron as too hard for"
17805,SECT. IV.,working in masses with the other metals. But the idea of hardness
17806,SECT. IV.,"is never associated with κύανος; and, if it had been hard like"
17807,SECT. IV.,"steel, certainly it would not have been a suitable material for the"
17808,SECT. IV.,intricate forms of dragons.
17809,SECT. IV.,
17810,SECT. IV.,[870] Il. iv. 510.
17811,SECT. IV.,
17812,SECT. IV.,"Again, the adjective κυάνεος means in colour what is blue and what"
17813,SECT. IV.,is deep; and by no means corresponds with the ordinary colour of
17814,SECT. IV.,"steel. All this, besides the strength of the negative evidence, seems"
17815,SECT. IV.,inconsistent with the idea that κύανος can have been steel.
17816,SECT. IV.,
17817,SECT. IV.,The Compiler of the Index to Eustathius makes κύανος (_in voc._)
17818,SECT. IV.,simply a dark metal. But Millin argues that κύανος without an epithet
17819,SECT. IV.,"is tin, and that with the epithet μέλας it is lead. He observes that"
17820,SECT. IV.,"Pliny[871] appears to call tin by the name of _plumbum_ simply, and"
17821,SECT. IV.,lead by the name of _plumbum nigrum_: so that the double use of
17822,SECT. IV.,κύανος and κασσίτερος for tin would be like that of _plumbum_ and
17823,SECT. IV.,_stannum_ for the same metal in Latin. This idea treats the substance
17824,SECT. IV.,as taking its name from the colour: and is so far sustained by the
17825,SECT. IV.,"use of the German _blei_, which I presume is the same word as _blau_,"
17826,SECT. IV.,for lead. But it would be singular that Homer should thus have double
17827,SECT. IV.,"names for two metals, which of all classes of objects have perhaps"
17828,SECT. IV.,been most commonly designated by single ones. And this hypothesis
17829,SECT. IV.,is not in accordance with the evident meaning of κυάνεος in Homer;
17830,SECT. IV.,since the word indicates a dark and deep hue very far from that of
17831,SECT. IV.,"tin, which Homer describes as white. The after use of κύανος is"
17832,SECT. IV.,equally adverse to the interpretation suggested.
17833,SECT. IV.,
17834,SECT. IV.,[871] H. N. xxxiv. 16. s. 47.
17835,SECT. IV.,
17836,SECT. IV.,The most probable interpretation for this difficult word appears
17837,SECT. IV.,to be that which is also in accordance with its subsequent use and
17838,SECT. IV.,"description as a colour. From Linton’s ‘Ancient and Modern Colours,’"
17839,SECT. IV.,"(p. 21,) it appears that there was a κύανος αὐτοφυὴς, which was a"
17840,SECT. IV.,"_native_ blue carbonate of copper: and that, according to the express"
17841,SECT. IV.,"testimony of Dioscorides, this was obtained by the ancients from"
17842,SECT. IV.,the copper-mines: κύανος δὲ γεννᾶται μὲν ἐν Κύπρῳ ἐκ τῶν χαλκουργῶν
17843,SECT. IV.,"μετάλλων, v. 106. This interpretation would account for our finding"
17844,SECT. IV.,κύανος in Homer: for the rarity of its use: for the dark colour and
17845,SECT. IV.,the affinity to πορφύρεος. Such a substance would make a good relief
17846,SECT. IV.,"for the cornice in the palace of Alcinous, against the copper-plated"
17847,SECT. IV.,walls: and would stand well in the rest of the passages where it
17848,SECT. IV.,"appears to be placed in relief with other metals, Il. xviii. 564,"
17849,SECT. IV.,"xi. 39, and even on the buckler of Agamemnon, xi. 24. For on this"
17850,SECT. IV.,"buckler, though the serpents, called κυάνεοι, are evidently placed"
17851,SECT. IV.,"in contrast with the οἶμοι, and though among the οἶμοι there are ten"
17852,SECT. IV.,"of κύανος, yet, as they are combined with twelve of gold and twenty"
17853,SECT. IV.,"of tin, the general effect would be one such as we need not suppose"
17854,SECT. IV.,Homer to have rejected. This blue carbonate is still found among
17855,SECT. IV.,"other copper-ores, but less in our deep mines, than in the shallow"
17856,SECT. IV.,ones worked by the ancients. I understand from a gentleman versed
17857,SECT. IV.,"in metallurgy, that in its purest form it is crystalline, rarely"
17858,SECT. IV.,"massive or earthy, of a deep azure, brittle, easily powdered, and"
17859,SECT. IV.,thus readily converted to use as a pigment.
17860,SECT. IV.,
17861,SECT. IV.,I should therefore suppose that the κύανος is not a metal: that the
17862,SECT. IV.,οἶμοι on the buckler mean lines or bands coloured in pigment: and
17863,SECT. IV.,that the boss on the shield is probably a nodule of the substance
17864,SECT. IV.,in its native state. We can thus understand why κύανος is not used
17865,SECT. IV.,"either with the gold, silver, χαλκὸς, and tin, in the forge of"
17866,SECT. IV.,"Vulcan, or with the gold, silver, iron, and χαλκὸς of the chariot"
17867,SECT. IV.,"of Juno[872]. We can also understand why, though κύανος is not used"
17868,SECT. IV.,"in the forge, yet the trench round the vineyard on the shield of"
17869,SECT. IV.,Achilles is κυανεή[873]. This interpretation is also in conformity
17870,SECT. IV.,with the Homeric employment of the adjective κυάνεος.

17880,SECT. IV.,"Of the four significations given to χαλκὸς in Homer (copper, brass,"

17882,SECT. IV.,"(1) because it is never mentioned as hard in the same way with it,"

17890,SECT. IV.,"very good cutting instruments (not, of course, equal to steel) may be"
17891,SECT. IV.,"made in a bronze composed of 87½ parts copper, and 12½ parts tin. But"
17892,SECT. IV.,for the following reasons:
17893,SECT. IV.,
17894,SECT. IV.,1. Homer always speaks of it as a pure metal along with other pure
17895,SECT. IV.,"metals, even where Vulcan casts it into the furnace to be wrought;"
17896,SECT. IV.,Il. xviii. 474.
17897,SECT. IV.,
17898,SECT. IV.,"2. Again, because, although we must not argue too confidently from"
17899,SECT. IV.,"Homer’s epithets of colour, yet in this case we may lay considerable"
17900,SECT. IV.,stress not only on his χαλκὸς ἐρυθρὸς (since the ἐρυθρὸς of Homer
17901,SECT. IV.,"leans to brightness), but upon the ἤνοψ and νώροψ, which mean bright"
17902,SECT. IV.,and gleaming. These epithets of light would not apply to bronze: nor
17903,SECT. IV.,would Homer plate with bronze the walls of the palace of Alcinous.
17904,SECT. IV.,Neither does it appear likely that he would give us a heaven of
17905,SECT. IV.,"bronze among the imposing imagery of battle, Il. xvii. 424."
17906,SECT. IV.,
17907,SECT. IV.,3. It does not appear that Homer knew anything at all of the fusion
17908,SECT. IV.,or alloying of metals.
17909,SECT. IV.,
17910,SECT. IV.,"We have, then, to conclude that χαλκὸς was copper, hardened by some"

17984,SECT. V.[875],"centre. On the other hand, Dante might, far better than Milton, be"
17985,SECT. V.[875],compared with Homer; for while he is in the Purgatorio and Paradiso
17986,SECT. V.[875],"far more heavenly than Milton, he is also throughout the _Divina"
17987,SECT. V.[875],Commedia_ truly and profoundly human. He is incessantly conversant with
17988,SECT. V.[875],the nature and the life of man; and though for the most part he draws
17989,SECT. V.[875],"us, as Flaxman has drawn him, in outline only, yet by the strength and"
17990,SECT. V.[875],"depth of his touch he has produced figures, for example, Francesca and"
17991,SECT. V.[875],"Ugolino, that have as largely become the common property of mankind,"
17992,SECT. V.[875],"if not as Achilles and Ulysses, yet as Lear and Hamlet. Still the"
17993,SECT. V.[875],"theological basis, and the extra-terrene theatre, of Dante’s poem"
17994,SECT. V.[875],"remove him to a great distance from Homer, from whom he seems to have"
17995,SECT. V.[875],"derived little, and with whom we may therefore feel assured he could"
17996,SECT. V.[875],have been but little acquainted.

18001,SECT. V.[875],manifest children of genius as to entitle them to the honour of being

18016,SECT. V.[875],"to metre, figures, names, places, persons and times, the two works,"
18017,SECT. V.[875],"where they do not actually concur, stand in as near relations one to"
18018,SECT. V.[875],"another, as seem to be attainable without absolute identity of subject;"
18019,SECT. V.[875],"yet it may be doubted whether any two great poems can be named, which"
18020,SECT. V.[875],are so profoundly discordant upon almost every point that touches

18027,SECT. V.[875],
18028,SECT. V.[875],The immense powers of Virgil as a poet had been demonstrated before he
18029,SECT. V.[875],wrote the Æneid. He had shown their full splendour in the Georgics;
18030,SECT. V.[875],"though the ἦθος, or (so to speak) the heart, even of that great"
18031,SECT. V.[875],work was touched with paralysis by his Epicurean and self-centring
18032,SECT. V.[875],philosophy. The Æneid does not bear a fainter impression of his genius.
18033,SECT. V.[875],"The wonderfully sustained beauty and majesty of its verse, the imposing"
18034,SECT. V.[875],"splendour of its most elaborate delineations, the power of the author"
18035,SECT. V.[875],"in unfolding, when he strives to do it, the resources of passion, and"
18036,SECT. V.[875],even perhaps the skill which he has shown in the general construction
18037,SECT. V.[875],"of his plot, cannot be too highly praised. But while its general nature"
18038,SECT. V.[875],as an epic (for the epic poem is preeminently ethical) brought its
18039,SECT. V.[875],"defects into fuller view, the particular object he proposed to himself"
18040,SECT. V.[875],was fatal to the attainment of the very highest excellence. While
18041,SECT. V.[875],"Homer sang for national glory, the poem of Virgil is toned throughout"
18042,SECT. V.[875],"to a spirit of courtierlike adulation. No muse, however vigorous, can"
18043,SECT. V.[875],maintain an upright gait under so base a burden.

18047,SECT. V.[875],"And yet, in regard to its external form, the Æneid is perhaps, as a"
18048,SECT. V.[875],"whole, the most majestic poem that the European mind has in any age"
18049,SECT. V.[875],produced. We often hear of the lofty march of the Iliad; but though
18050,SECT. V.[875],"its versification is always appropriate and therefore never mean,"
18051,SECT. V.[875],"it only rises into stateliness, or into a high-pitched sublimity,"
18052,SECT. V.[875],when Homer has occasion to brace his energies for an effort. He is
18053,SECT. V.[875],"invariably true to his own conception of the bard[877], as one who"
18054,SECT. V.[875],"should win and delight the soul of the hearer; and so, when he has"
18055,SECT. V.[875],"strung himself, like a bow, for some great passage of his action,"
18056,SECT. V.[875],"‘has brought the string to the breast, the iron to the wood,’ and"
18057,SECT. V.[875],"has hit his mark, straightway he unbends himself again. Thus he"
18058,SECT. V.[875],ushers in with true grandeur the marshalling of the Greek army in the
18059,SECT. V.[875],"Second Book, partly by the invocation of the Muses, and partly by an"
18060,SECT. V.[875],"assemblage of no less than six consecutive similes, which describe"
18061,SECT. V.[875],"respectively the flash of the Greek arms, the resounding tramp, the"
18062,SECT. V.[875],"swarming numbers, the settling down of the ranks as they form the"
18063,SECT. V.[875],"line, the busy marshalling by the commanders, the majesty of Agamemnon"
18064,SECT. V.[875],"preeminent among them[878]. Having done this, he sets himself about"
18065,SECT. V.[875],"the Catalogue, with no contempt indeed of poetical embellishment by"
18066,SECT. V.[875],"epithets, and with an occasional relief by short legends, but still"
18067,SECT. V.[875],"in the main as a matter of business, historical, geographical, and"
18068,SECT. V.[875],"topographical. And thus he proceeds, with perfect tranquillity, for"
18069,SECT. V.[875],"near three hundred lines, until his work is done. We then find that"
18070,SECT. V.[875],"he has given us, together with a most minute account of the forces,"
18071,SECT. V.[875],a living map of the territories occupied by the Greek races of the
18072,SECT. V.[875],"age. But Virgil, in his imitation of the Homeric Catalogue (upon"
18073,SECT. V.[875],"which there will be further occasion to comment hereafter, with"
18074,SECT. V.[875],"reference to other matters), has pursued a course quite different."
18075,SECT. V.[875],"Waiving Homer’s gorgeous introduction, which pours from a single"
18076,SECT. V.[875],"point a broad stream of splendour over the whole, Virgil with vast,"
18077,SECT. V.[875],"and indeed rather painful, effort, carries us through his long-drawn"
18078,SECT. V.[875],list at a laboriously-sustained elevation. To vary the wearisome
18079,SECT. V.[875],"task, he uses every diversity of turn that language and grammar can"
18080,SECT. V.[875],"supply[879]. He passes from nominative to vocative, and from vocative"
18081,SECT. V.[875],"to nominative. Somebody was present, and then somebody was not absent."
18082,SECT. V.[875],"Arms and accoutrements are got up as minutely, as if he had been a"
18083,SECT. V.[875],careful master of costumes dressing a new drama for the stage. That
18084,SECT. V.[875],"we may never be let down for a moment, he distributes here and there"
18085,SECT. V.[875],"the similes, which Homer accumulated at the opening, and introduces,"
18086,SECT. V.[875],"between the accounts of military contingents, legends of twenty or more"
18087,SECT. V.[875],"lines. Upon the whole, the level of his verse through the Catalogue,"
18088,SECT. V.[875],"instead of being, like Homer’s, decidedly lower, is even higher than is"
18089,SECT. V.[875],"usual with him. There is not in it, I think, a single verse approaching"
18090,SECT. V.[875],to the _sermo pedestris_. His reader misses that tranquillizing relief
18091,SECT. V.[875],"so agreeable in Homer, which varies as it were the play of the muscles,"
18092,SECT. V.[875],and freshens the faculties for a return to higher efforts. Virgil seems
18093,SECT. V.[875],"to treat us, as horses at a certain stage of their decline are treated"
18094,SECT. V.[875],"by experienced drivers, who keep them going from fear that, if they"
18095,SECT. V.[875],"once let them stop or slacken, they will be unable to get up their pace"
18096,SECT. V.[875],"again. He never unbends his bow. But a table-land may be as flat, and"
18097,SECT. V.[875],"even wearisome, as a plain; and the ornaments in the Æneid frequently"
18098,SECT. V.[875],"are not, and indeed could hardly be, more ornamental than the passages"

18120,SECT. V.[875],"The sustained stateliness of diction, metre, and rhythm in the Æneid"
18121,SECT. V.[875],"is a feat, and an astounding feat; but it is more like the performance"
18122,SECT. V.[875],"of a trained athlete, between trick and strength, than the grandeur"
18123,SECT. V.[875],"of free and simple Nature, such as it is seen in the ancient warrior,"

18125,SECT. V.[875],"Different persons will, according to their temperaments, be apt to"
18126,SECT. V.[875],"treat this augustness of diction as a merit or a fault: all, however,"
18127,SECT. V.[875],must acknowledge it to be a wonder. In this respect Virgil has been
18128,SECT. V.[875],"followed with no ordinary power, but yet not equalled, by Tasso. And"
18129,SECT. V.[875],"the impression, created in this respect by the Æneid as it stands, must"
18130,SECT. V.[875],"be heightened when we remember that it is still an unfinished poem,"

18144,SECT. V.[875],It is perhaps hardly possible to exhaust the topics of censure which
18145,SECT. V.[875],may be justly used against the Æneas of Virgil. His moral deficiencies
18146,SECT. V.[875],are not (so to speak) hidden amidst the accomplishments of a manly
18147,SECT. V.[875],"intellect, nor his intellectual mediocrity redeemed by any fresh and"
18148,SECT. V.[875],"genuine virtues. He is not, to our knowledge, a statesman; nay more,"
18149,SECT. V.[875],he is not a warrior; for we feel that his battles and feats of war are
18150,SECT. V.[875],"the poet’s, and not his: and when he appears in arms we are tempted"
18151,SECT. V.[875],"to ask, ‘Son of Venus, what business have you here?’ The violent"
18152,SECT. V.[875],"exaggerations, by which Virgil attempts to vamp up his hero’s martial"
18153,SECT. V.[875],"character, only produce the ψυχρὸν of Longinus; a cold reaction,"
18154,SECT. V.[875],"approaching to a shudder, through the reader’s mind. As, for instance,"
18155,SECT. V.[875],"when in the Shades below, the poet represents the Greek chieftains[882]"
18156,SECT. V.[875],"as trembling and flying at the sight of him, the nobleness of the"
18157,SECT. V.[875],"verses cannot excuse either the tasteless solecism of the thought,"
18158,SECT. V.[875],or the profanation offered to the memory of Homer in the person of
18159,SECT. V.[875],"his heroes, who indeed often made Æneas tremble, but never trembled"
18160,SECT. V.[875],"at him themselves. But Virgil goes further yet, when he makes Diomed"
18161,SECT. V.[875],"assert[883] that, having been engaged in single combat with Æneas, he"
18162,SECT. V.[875],"knows by experience how terrible a warrior he will prove; and that, had"
18163,SECT. V.[875],"there been two more such men, Troy would have conquered Greece, and"
18164,SECT. V.[875],"not Greece Troy. Now, Æneas never in the Iliad even once executes a"
18165,SECT. V.[875],"real feat of war; and as to the single combat between the two chiefs,"
18166,SECT. V.[875],"Diomed first knocked him down with a stone[884], and then, after he had"
18167,SECT. V.[875],"been carried off and apparently set to rights by his mother, he was"
18168,SECT. V.[875],thrice saved from the deadly charge of the same warrior by the single
18169,SECT. V.[875],"intervention of Apollo, who by divine force arrested the attack. In"

18171,SECT. V.[875],"it appears, so far as his popularity was concerned, thus mutilate and"
18172,SECT. V.[875],"falsify the author from whose wealth he so largely borrowed, either the"

18207,SECT. V.[875],"have seen[886], he may probably have been, by the dignity of lineal"
18208,SECT. V.[875],"descent, the head of the whole Trojan race. But Homer pays him off"
18209,SECT. V.[875],"with generalities; for, as no Poet is greater in the really creative"
18210,SECT. V.[875],"work of character, so none better understands how, where the purpose"
18211,SECT. V.[875],"of his poem requires it, to take a lay figure, and stuff him out with"
18212,SECT. V.[875],"straw. In what may be called the vital action of the Iliad, Æneas has"

18249,SECT. V.[875],"cowardice of Drances, is a work of such extraordinary power and merit,"
18250,SECT. V.[875],that it is fit (and this I take for the summit of all eulogies) even to
18251,SECT. V.[875],"have been spoken by the Achilles of Homer. In vigorous reasoning, in"
18252,SECT. V.[875],"biting sarcasm, in chivalrous sentiment, and in indignant passion, it"
18253,SECT. V.[875],"presents a combination not easily to be matched; and it is, as a whole,"
18254,SECT. V.[875],"admirably adapted to the oratorical purpose, for which it is presumed"
18255,SECT. V.[875],"to have been delivered. But, indeed, from our first view of Turnus to"
18256,SECT. V.[875],"our last, we do not find in him a single trait feeble in itself, or"
18257,SECT. V.[875],"unworthy of the masculine idea and intention of the portrait, except"
18258,SECT. V.[875],"where, in the very last passage of his life, his free agency seems to"
18259,SECT. V.[875],"be taken, as it were by force, out of his hands."
18260,SECT. V.[875],
18261,SECT. V.[875],~_The false position of Virgil._~
18262,SECT. V.[875],
18263,SECT. V.[875],The failure in the Æneas of Virgil cannot be compared with the case of
18264,SECT. V.[875],"any modern romance, such as the Waverley or Old Mortality of Scott,"
18265,SECT. V.[875],where the hero may be an insipid person. All the greater modern
18266,SECT. V.[875],inventors have been compelled to lay their foundations in the palpable
18267,SECT. V.[875],breadth of some historic event: it was the prouder distinction of the
18268,SECT. V.[875],"Homeric epic, that it had a living centre; it hung upon a man; there"
18269,SECT. V.[875],was enough of vital power in Homer for this end: his Achilles and his
18270,SECT. V.[875],"Ulysses were each an Atlas, that sustained the world in which they"
18271,SECT. V.[875],"also moved. Virgil made his poem an Æneid, instead of following the"
18272,SECT. V.[875],"example of the Cyclic poets; he thus pledged himself to his readers,"
18273,SECT. V.[875],"that Æneas should be its centre, its pole, its inward light and life."
18274,SECT. V.[875],But he did not keep his word: he had drawn the bow of Homer without
18275,SECT. V.[875],Homer’s force. He marks perhaps the final transition from the old epic
18276,SECT. V.[875],"of the first class to the new. After him we have the epics of fact, the"
18277,SECT. V.[875],"Pharsalia, the Thebaid, and so forth. But Æneas stands before us with"
18278,SECT. V.[875],the pretensions of Achilles and Ulysses; and the failure is great in
18279,SECT. V.[875],"proportion to the gigantic scale of the attempt. When, in the Italian"
18280,SECT. V.[875],"romance, the character of the ideal man, as shown in Orlando, again"
18281,SECT. V.[875],"became the basis of new epic poems, we again find in the protagonist"
18282,SECT. V.[875],"great weakness indeed, as compared with Achilles and Ulysses; but"
18283,SECT. V.[875],strength and success as compared with the Æneas of Virgil.
18284,SECT. V.[875],
18285,SECT. V.[875],Upon the whole we are thrown back on the supposition that this crying
18286,SECT. V.[875],"vice of the Æneid, the feebleness and untruth of the character of"
18287,SECT. V.[875],"Æneas, was due to the false position of Virgil, who was obliged to"
18288,SECT. V.[875],discharge his functions as a poet in subjection to his dominant
18289,SECT. V.[875],obligations and liabilities as a courtly parasite of Augustus. As
18290,SECT. V.[875],"the entire poem, so the character of its hero, was, before all other"
18291,SECT. V.[875],"things, an instrument for glorifying the Emperor of Rome. It at once"
18292,SECT. V.[875],"followed, that in all respects must that character be such as to avoid"
18293,SECT. V.[875],"suggesting a comparison disadvantageous to the person whose dignity,"
18294,SECT. V.[875],"for political ends, had already been elevated even into the unseen"
18295,SECT. V.[875],"world; nay, whose forestalled divinity was to be kept in a relation"
18296,SECT. V.[875],of absolute and broad superiority to the image of his human ancestor.
18297,SECT. V.[875],"Æneas is himself addressed in the action of the Æneid, as"
18298,SECT. V.[875],
18299,SECT. V.[875],"Dîs genite, et geniture deos."
18300,SECT. V.[875],
18301,SECT. V.[875],"In order to arrive at the disastrous effects of this mental servitude,"
18302,SECT. V.[875],"take, first, the measure of the cold and unheroic character of"
18303,SECT. V.[875],"Augustus; then estimate the degree of relative superiority, which it"
18304,SECT. V.[875],was essential to Virgil’s position that he should preserve for him
18305,SECT. V.[875],throughout; and thus we may come to some practical conception of the
18306,SECT. V.[875],"straitness of the space within which Virgil had to develop his Æneas,"
18307,SECT. V.[875],"or, in other words, to run his match against Homer. All the faults, and"
18308,SECT. V.[875],"all the faultiness, of his poem may be really owing, in a degree none"
18309,SECT. V.[875],"can say how great, to this original falseness of position."
18310,SECT. V.[875],
18311,SECT. V.[875],On account of the personal principle on which the ancient epic was
18312,SECT. V.[875],"constructed, failure in the character of the hero must almost of"
18313,SECT. V.[875],necessity have entailed failure in the poem. Most of all would this
18314,SECT. V.[875],"follow in a case where, as in the Æneid, the hero is never out of view,"
18315,SECT. V.[875],"and where the action does not, as in the Iliad, travel away from his"
18316,SECT. V.[875],"person, in order then to enhance the splendour and effectiveness of his"
18317,SECT. V.[875],reappearance. Thus the falseness of Virgil’s position was not confined
18318,SECT. V.[875],"to an individual character, but extended to his entire work. Living,"
18319,SECT. V.[875],"too, in an age less natural and more critical than that of Homer, he"
18320,SECT. V.[875],"provided against criticism, so far as regarded its merely technical"
18321,SECT. V.[875],"functions, more, and he studied nature less. He had to construct his"
18322,SECT. V.[875],"epic for a court, and a corrupt court, not for mankind at large; it"
18323,SECT. V.[875],"followed, that he could not take his stand upon those deep and broad"
18324,SECT. V.[875],"foundations in human nature itself, which gave Homer a position of"
18325,SECT. V.[875],universal command. Hence as a general rule he does not sing from the
18326,SECT. V.[875],"heart, nor to the heart. His touches of genuine nature are rare. Such"
18327,SECT. V.[875],"of them as occur have been carefully noted and applauded, for he is"
18328,SECT. V.[875],always studious to set them off by choice and melodious diction. For my
18329,SECT. V.[875],"own part, I find scarcely any among them so true as the simile of the"
18330,SECT. V.[875],"mother labouring with her maidens at night, which he owes to Homer[889]:"

18339,SECT. V.[875],"~_As to religion, liberty, and nationality._~"
18340,SECT. V.[875],
18341,SECT. V.[875],"With rare exceptions, the reader of Virgil finds himself utterly at a"
18342,SECT. V.[875],loss to see at any point the soul of the poet reflected in his work. We
18343,SECT. V.[875],"cannot tell, amidst the splendid phantasmagoria, where is his heart,"
18344,SECT. V.[875],"where lie his sympathies. In Homer a genial spirit, breathed from the"
18345,SECT. V.[875],"Poet himself, is translucent through the whole; in the Æneid we look in"
18346,SECT. V.[875],"vain almost for a single ray of it. Again, Virgil lived at a time when"
18347,SECT. V.[875],the prevailing religion had lost whatever elements of real influence
18348,SECT. V.[875],"that of Homer’s era either possessed in its own right, or inherited"
18349,SECT. V.[875],from pristine tradition. It was undermined at once by philosophy and
18350,SECT. V.[875],"by licentiousness; and it subsisted only as a machinery, a machinery,"
18351,SECT. V.[875],"too, already terribly discredited, for civil ends. Thus he lost one"
18352,SECT. V.[875],"great element of truth and nature, as well as of sublimity and pathos."
18353,SECT. V.[875],The extinction of liberty utterly deprived him of another. Homer saw
18354,SECT. V.[875],"before him both a religion and a polity young, fresh, and vigorous; for"
18355,SECT. V.[875],Virgil both were practically dead: and whatever this world has of true
18356,SECT. V.[875],"greatness is so closely dependent upon them, that it was not his fault"
18357,SECT. V.[875],if his poem felt and bears cogent witness to the loss. Even the sphere
18358,SECT. V.[875],of personal morality was not open to him; for what principle of truth
18359,SECT. V.[875],"or righteousness could he worthily have glorified, without passing"
18360,SECT. V.[875],"severe condemnation on some capital act of the man, whom it was his"
18361,SECT. V.[875],chief obligation to exalt?
18362,SECT. V.[875],
18363,SECT. V.[875],And once more. Homer sang to his own people of the glorious deeds of
18364,SECT. V.[875],"their sires, to whom they were united by fond recollection, and by"
18365,SECT. V.[875],near historic and local ties. This was at once a stimulus and a check;
18366,SECT. V.[875],"it cheered his labour, and at the same time it absolutely required"
18367,SECT. V.[875],him to study moral harmony and consistency. Virgil sang to Romans of
18368,SECT. V.[875],"the deeds of those who were not Romans, and whom only a most hollow"
18369,SECT. V.[875],"fiction connected with his hearers, through the dim vista of a thousand"
18370,SECT. V.[875],"years, and under circumstances which made the pretence to historical"
18371,SECT. V.[875],"continuity little better than ridiculous. Or rather, he sang thus, not"
18372,SECT. V.[875],"to Romans, but to their Emperor; he had to bear in mind, not the great"
18373,SECT. V.[875],"fountains of emotion in the human heart, but his town-house on the"
18374,SECT. V.[875],"Esquiline, and his country-house on the road from Naples to Pozzuoli."
18375,SECT. V.[875],"In dealing with Greeks, with Trojans, with Carthaginians, he again lost"
18376,SECT. V.[875],Homer’s double advantage: he had nothing to give a healthy stimulus
18377,SECT. V.[875],"to his imagination, and nothing to bring him or to keep him to the"
18378,SECT. V.[875],"standard of truth and nature. And here, perhaps, we hit upon some clue"
18379,SECT. V.[875],to the superior character and attractions of Turnus. The Poet was now
18380,SECT. V.[875],"for once upon true national ground: he was an Italian minstrel, singing"
18381,SECT. V.[875],"to Italians, whether truly or mythically is of less consequence, about"
18382,SECT. V.[875],an Italian hero. Thus he had something like the proper materials to
18383,SECT. V.[875],"work with; and the result is one worthy of his noble powers, though"
18384,SECT. V.[875],it has the strange consequence of setting all the best sympathies of
18385,SECT. V.[875],"his readers, and of implying that his own were already set, in direct"
18386,SECT. V.[875],opposition to the ostensible purpose of his poem.
18387,SECT. V.[875],
18388,SECT. V.[875],"It appears, however, as if this great and splendid Poet, being"
18389,SECT. V.[875],thrown out of his true bearings in regard to all the deeper sources
18390,SECT. V.[875],"of interest on which an epic writer must depend, such as religion,"
18391,SECT. V.[875],"patriotism, and liberty, became consequently reckless, alike in major"
18392,SECT. V.[875],"and in minor matters, as to all the inner harmonies of his work, and"
18393,SECT. V.[875],contented himself with the most unwearied and fastidious labours in its
18394,SECT. V.[875],"outward elaboration, where he could give scope to his extraordinary"
18395,SECT. V.[875],powers of versification and of diction without fear of stumbling upon
18396,SECT. V.[875],anything unfit for the artificial atmosphere of the Roman court. The
18397,SECT. V.[875],"consequence is, that a vein of untruthfulness runs throughout the whole"
18398,SECT. V.[875],"Æneid, as strong and as remarkable as is the genuineness of thought and"
18399,SECT. V.[875],"feeling in the Homeric poems. Homer walks in the open day, Virgil by"
18400,SECT. V.[875],"lamplight. Homer gives us figures that breathe and move, Virgil usually"
18401,SECT. V.[875],"treats us to waxwork. Homer has the full force and play of the drama,"
18402,SECT. V.[875],Virgil is essentially operatic. From Virgil back to Homer is a greater
18403,SECT. V.[875],"distance, than from Homer back to life."
18404,SECT. V.[875],
18405,SECT. V.[875],~_Homer is misapprehended through Virgil._~
18406,SECT. V.[875],
18407,SECT. V.[875],"But more. Virgil is at once the copyist of Homer, and, for the"
18408,SECT. V.[875],"generality of educated men, his interpreter[891]. In all modern Europe"
18409,SECT. V.[875],"taken together, Virgil has had ten who read him, and ten who remember"
18410,SECT. V.[875],"him, for one that Homer could show. Taking this in conjunction with the"
18411,SECT. V.[875],"great extent of the ground they occupy in common, we may find reason to"
18412,SECT. V.[875],"think that the traditional and public idea of Homer’s works, throughout"
18413,SECT. V.[875],"the entire sphere of the Western civilization, has been formed, to a"
18414,SECT. V.[875],"much greater degree than could at first be supposed, by the Virgilian"
18415,SECT. V.[875],"copies from him. This is only to say, in other words, that it has been"
18416,SECT. V.[875],"sadly impaired, not to say seriously falsified; for there is scarcely"
18417,SECT. V.[875],"a point of vital moment, in which Virgil follows Homer faithfully, or"
18418,SECT. V.[875],represents him either fairly or completely. Now this traditional idea
18419,SECT. V.[875],"is not only the stock idea that governs the indifferent public, but"
18420,SECT. V.[875],"it is likewise the idea with which the individual student starts, and"
18421,SECT. V.[875],which governs him until he has reached such a point in his progress as
18422,SECT. V.[875],"to discover the necessity, and be conscious moreover of the strength,"
18423,SECT. V.[875],"to throw it off. This, however, is a point that, from the nature of"
18424,SECT. V.[875],"human life and its pursuits, very few students indeed can reach at"
18425,SECT. V.[875],"all. Elsewhere we shall see, with what evil and untrue effect Virgil"
18426,SECT. V.[875],has handled some of the Homeric characters. It is the same in every
18427,SECT. V.[875],minor trait; and it seems strange that so great a Poet should not have
18428,SECT. V.[875],"had enough of reverence for another Poet, greater still and enshrined"
18429,SECT. V.[875],"in almost the worship of all ages, to have restrained him from such"
18430,SECT. V.[875],"constant and wanton, as well as wilful, mutilations of the Homeric"
18431,SECT. V.[875],"tradition. It would, however, appear that Virgil’s miscarriages are not"
18432,SECT. V.[875],"all due to carelessness, in the common sense of it. In many instances,"
18433,SECT. V.[875],unless so far as they can be referred to the necessities that press
18434,SECT. V.[875],"upon a courtier, it would seem as if they must be ascribable to torpor"
18435,SECT. V.[875],"in the faculties, or defect in the habit of mind, by which Homer should"
18436,SECT. V.[875],"have been appreciated. Nay, sometimes he appears to have been moved"
18437,SECT. V.[875],simply by metrical convenience to alter the traditions of Homer. Let us
18438,SECT. V.[875],take first a minor instance to test this assertion.
18439,SECT. V.[875],
18440,SECT. V.[875],"[891] In Dibdin’s ‘Editions of the Greek and Latin Classics,’ we find"
18441,SECT. V.[875],nineteen editions of Virgil between 1469 and 1478. The _Princeps_
18442,SECT. V.[875],"of Homer was only printed in 1488. Panzer, according to Dibdin,"
18443,SECT. V.[875],enumerates ninety editions of Virgil in the 15th century (ii. 540.).
18444,SECT. V.[875],"Mr. Hallam says (Lit. Eur., i. 420.), ‘Ariosto has been _after Homer_"
18445,SECT. V.[875],the favourite poet of Europe.’ I presume this distinguished writer does
18446,SECT. V.[875],not mean to imply that Homer has been more read than any other poet.
18447,SECT. V.[875],Can his words mean that Homer has been more approved? It is worth while
18448,SECT. V.[875],to ask the question: for the judgments of Mr. Hallam are like those of
18449,SECT. V.[875],"Minos, and reach into the future."
18450,SECT. V.[875],
18451,SECT. V.[875],Nothing can be more marked than the prominence of the Scamander as
18452,SECT. V.[875],compared with the Simois in Homer. The Simois is named by him only six
18453,SECT. V.[875],"times, and none of the passages show it to have been a considerable"
18454,SECT. V.[875],"stream. In the Twenty-first Book[892], Scamander invites Simois to join"
18455,SECT. V.[875],"him in pouring forth the flood which was to bear away Achilles, but"
18456,SECT. V.[875],"his ‘brother’ neither replies, nor takes part in the action. It would"
18457,SECT. V.[875],"appear, indeed, from geographical considerations, which belong to the"
18458,SECT. V.[875],"topography of the Troad, that in the summer Simois was probably dry."
18459,SECT. V.[875],This entirely accords with the passage in which this river supplies
18460,SECT. V.[875],"ἀμβροσίη[893], a figure, as may be presumed, of grass, for the horses"
18461,SECT. V.[875],"of Juno. At any rate, that passage is at variance with the idea of the"
18462,SECT. V.[875],"river as a tearing torrent. Again, Homer mentions[894] that many heroes"
18463,SECT. V.[875],"fell, he does not say in, but about, the stream: above all, he does not"
18464,SECT. V.[875],"say they fell into its waters, but in the dust of it, or near it:"

18474,SECT. V.[875],
18475,SECT. V.[875],"Again, Scamander is personified as the god Xanthus, and plays a great"
18476,SECT. V.[875],part in the action: Simois is not personified at all. Scamander is
18477,SECT. V.[875],"δῖος, διοτρεφὴς and much besides: Simois has no epithets. Simoeisius is"
18478,SECT. V.[875],"the son of Anthemion, a person of secondary account; but Scamandrius is"
18479,SECT. V.[875],"the name given by Hector to his boy. Simois, for all we know, may have"
18480,SECT. V.[875],"been either a dry bed, or little better than a rivulet; but armed men"
18481,SECT. V.[875],"are thrown into Scamander, and whirled by him to the sea. Lastly, the"
18482,SECT. V.[875],"plain where the Greek army was reviewed is λειμὼν Σκαμάνδριος, πέδιον"
18483,SECT. V.[875],Σκαμάνδριον. Now a right conception of these rivers is not altogether
18484,SECT. V.[875],"an insignificant affair, but is material to the clearness of our ideas"
18485,SECT. V.[875],upon the military action of the poem. What then has Virgil done with
18486,SECT. V.[875],them? He has simply reversed the Homeric representation. Xanthus is
18487,SECT. V.[875],"with him the unmarked river, Simois is the mighty torrent. Witness"
18488,SECT. V.[875],these passages:
18489,SECT. V.[875],
18490,SECT. V.[875],"Mitto ea, quæ muris bellando exhausta sub altis,"

18496,SECT. V.[875],
18497,SECT. V.[875],"And most of all, the passage which he has directly carried off from"
18498,SECT. V.[875],"Homer, and corrupted it on his way (Æn. i. 104):"
18499,SECT. V.[875],
18500,SECT. V.[875],Ubi tot Simois correpta sub undis

18502,SECT. V.[875],
18503,SECT. V.[875],"And why all this? Plainly, I apprehend, because, while Scamander was"
18504,SECT. V.[875],"a word disqualified from entering into the Latin hexameter, Xanthus"
18505,SECT. V.[875],also was somewhat less convenient than Simois for the march of his
18506,SECT. V.[875],resounding verse. Now this is a sample in small things of what Virgil

18513,SECT. V.[875],consideration may lead to a reversal of the sentence. The νεκυΐα of
18514,SECT. V.[875],"the Eleventh Odyssey, for example, is thought inferior to that of the"
18515,SECT. V.[875],"Sixth Æneid. To bring them fairly together, we should perhaps put out"
18516,SECT. V.[875],of view the philosophical and prophetical part of the latter[895]; but
18517,SECT. V.[875],whether we do it or not is little material in the comparison. In either
18518,SECT. V.[875],"way, the _Inferno_ of Virgil is, upon the whole, a stage procession of"
18519,SECT. V.[875],stately and gorgeous figures; but it has no consistent or veracious
18520,SECT. V.[875],relation to any idea of the future or unseen state actually operative
18521,SECT. V.[875],"among mankind. Yet there existed such an idea, at least in the times"
18522,SECT. V.[875],"of which Virgil was treating, if not at the period when he lived. It"
18523,SECT. V.[875],"was surely a subject of the deepest interest, and of the most solemn"
18524,SECT. V.[875],pathos. What we are as men here depends very much on our conception
18525,SECT. V.[875],of what we are hereafter to be. There is nothing more touching in all
18526,SECT. V.[875],"the history of the race of Adam, than its blind and painful feeling"
18527,SECT. V.[875],after a future still invisible. There is no witness to the comparative
18528,SECT. V.[875],"degradation of a race or age, so sure as its having ceased to yearn"
18529,SECT. V.[875],towards any thing beyond the grave. Homer has shown us in the Eleventh
18530,SECT. V.[875],"Odyssey[896], that, together with his keen sense of the present and"
18531,SECT. V.[875],"visible, he felt the full force of this mysterious drawing towards the"
18532,SECT. V.[875],"unseen. He is plainly as much in earnest here, as in any part of the"
18533,SECT. V.[875],"poems. Virgil, on the other hand, succeeds in investing his hell with"
18534,SECT. V.[875],"almost unequalled pomp, approximating at times to splendour. Homer"
18535,SECT. V.[875],attempts nothing of the kind; but he produces a perfect and profound
18536,SECT. V.[875],"impression of those regions, according to the idea in his own mind:"
18537,SECT. V.[875],"they are shadowy, gloomy, cold, above all, and in one word, dismal."
18538,SECT. V.[875],Virgil contrives to leave the reader convinced that _he_ is a very
18539,SECT. V.[875],great artist: Homer lets all such matters take care of themselves.
18540,SECT. V.[875],But while Virgil creates no impression at all on the mind as to the
18541,SECT. V.[875],"World of Shades, no image of the timid, vague, and dim belief that"
18542,SECT. V.[875],"was entertained respecting it, Homer has set it all before us with a"
18543,SECT. V.[875],truthfulness never equalled or approached. And yet Virgil abounds in
18544,SECT. V.[875],details and measurements which Homer avoids. Tartarus is twice as deep
18545,SECT. V.[875],"as the distance from earth to sky[897], and the Hydra has fifty mouths."
18546,SECT. V.[875],"Yet the details of the one give no impression of reality, while the"
18547,SECT. V.[875],utter local vagueness and dreaminess of the other is far more definite
18548,SECT. V.[875],"in its effect, because it is made to minister to the appropriate"
18549,SECT. V.[875],"ideas of sadness, sympathy, and awe. As to particular passages, the"
18550,SECT. V.[875],"appearance of Dido is full of grandeur; but her silence, the basis of"
18551,SECT. V.[875],"it, is borrowed from that of Ajax; while in the Odyssey the striding of"
18552,SECT. V.[875],"Achilles in silence over the meadow of asphodel, when he swells with"
18553,SECT. V.[875],"exultation upon hearing that his son excelled in council and in war, is"
18554,SECT. V.[875],"perhaps one of the most sublime pieces of human representation, which"
18555,SECT. V.[875],Homer himself ever has produced.

18558,SECT. V.[875],
18559,SECT. V.[875],[896] We cannot safely assume the second Νεκυΐα of Od. xxiv. to be free
18560,SECT. V.[875],from interpolations.
18561,SECT. V.[875],
18562,SECT. V.[875],[897] Homer has used this figure; but in an entirely different
18563,SECT. V.[875],"connection, Il. viii. 13-16."
18564,SECT. V.[875],
18565,SECT. V.[875],~_Ethnological dislocations._~
18566,SECT. V.[875],
18567,SECT. V.[875],Let us now give an instance of Virgil’s utter indifference to historic
18568,SECT. V.[875],"truth and consistency. It is the more remarkable, because as he was"
18569,SECT. V.[875],"pretending to derive the Julian family from the stock of Æneas, there"
18570,SECT. V.[875],would apparently have been some advantage in adhering strictly to the
18571,SECT. V.[875],Homeric distinctions as to races on both sides in the Trojan war. But
18572,SECT. V.[875],"this appears to be entirely beneath his attention. For instance, he"
18573,SECT. V.[875],calls the Homeric Greeks Pelasgi[898]. It may be said he was guided by
18574,SECT. V.[875],"the Italian traditions, which connected the Greek and Pelasgian names"
18575,SECT. V.[875],"as early colonists of that country. But first, some regard should be"
18576,SECT. V.[875],paid to Homer in matters which concern Troy; and it is rather violent
18577,SECT. V.[875],"to call the Greeks Pelasgi, when the only Pelasgi named in the war by"
18578,SECT. V.[875],"the Poet are placed on the side of their enemies. Secondly, as it was"
18579,SECT. V.[875],"his purpose throughout to depress the Greeks, why should he thus thrust"
18580,SECT. V.[875],"them into view as one with an Italian race? Above all, why do this"
18581,SECT. V.[875],"in a case, where Homer had himself supplied a link between Italy and"
18582,SECT. V.[875],"Troy? Again, Virgil calls the Greek camp _Dorica_ castra[899]. But the"
18583,SECT. V.[875],"Dorians at the period of the Trojan war were utterly insignificant, and"
18584,SECT. V.[875],"are never once named by Homer in connection with the contest. Again,"
18585,SECT. V.[875],"Virgil calls Diomed, and the city of Arpi founded by him, Ætolian, and"
18586,SECT. V.[875],"makes him complain that he was not allowed to go back to Calydon[900],"
18587,SECT. V.[875],"simply because his father Tydeus, as a son of Œneus, had been of"
18588,SECT. V.[875],"Ætolian extraction; though he commanded the Argives, and had nothing"
18589,SECT. V.[875],"whatever to do with the Ætolians of Homer. Again, following a late and"
18590,SECT. V.[875],"purposeless tradition, he calls Ulysses Æolides[901], though Homer"
18591,SECT. V.[875],has given the descent of Ulysses[902] without in any manner attaching
18592,SECT. V.[875],"it to the line of the Æolids, a collection of families whose descent,"
18593,SECT. V.[875],"on account probably of their historical importance, he is more than"
18594,SECT. V.[875],ordinarily careful to mark.

18606,SECT. V.[875],"With cases of simple inaccuracy, to which I do not seek to attach undue"
18607,SECT. V.[875],"weight, we may connect the manner in which he confounds, on the other"
18608,SECT. V.[875],"side, the distinctions of the Trojan races, so accurately marked by"
18609,SECT. V.[875],"Homer. In the Twentieth Iliad, the genealogy of the reigning families"
18610,SECT. V.[875],of Troy and of Dardania is given with great precision. The distinction
18611,SECT. V.[875],"between Trojans and Dardanians is preserved through the Iliad, though"
18612,SECT. V.[875],"the Trojan name is sometimes, but rarely, used to include the whole"
18613,SECT. V.[875],"indigenous army, and sometimes it even signifies the entire force,"
18614,SECT. V.[875],"including the allies, which opposed the Greek army. We might here,"
18615,SECT. V.[875],"however, suppose that it would have been in the interest of Virgil’s"
18616,SECT. V.[875],"aim to maintain, or even sharpen, the distinction between the Dardanian"
18617,SECT. V.[875],"line, which was at most but indirectly worsted by the Greeks, and the"
18618,SECT. V.[875],"line of Ilus, which fatally both sinned and suffered in the conflict of"
18619,SECT. V.[875],"the _Troica_. But, on the contrary, he is still less discriminating in"
18620,SECT. V.[875],"the use of names here, than he has been for the Greeks. The companions"
18621,SECT. V.[875],"of Æneas are sometimes Teucri, Trojani, or Trojugenæ--sometimes"
18622,SECT. V.[875],"Æneadæ, sometimes Dardanidæ. In the first of these names he entirely"
18623,SECT. V.[875],"contravenes Homer, who produces a Teucer eminent among the Greeks,"
18624,SECT. V.[875],"but nowhere connects the name with Troy, while Virgil makes a Cretan"
18625,SECT. V.[875],Teucer[903] the founder of the Trojan race. I grant that he here
18626,SECT. V.[875],"founds himself upon what may be called a separate tradition, though"
18627,SECT. V.[875],"it is vague and slender, of a Teucrian race in Troas. In the two last"
18628,SECT. V.[875],"appellations, without any authority, he wholly alters the effect of"
18629,SECT. V.[875],"the Greek patronymic, and changes the mere family-name into a national"
18630,SECT. V.[875],appellation. Then again they appear as the Pergamea gens[904]. But
18631,SECT. V.[875],"Pergamus in Homer was simply the citadel of Troy, and is a correlative"
18632,SECT. V.[875],to πύργος[905]: the English might almost as well be called the people
18633,SECT. V.[875],"of the Tower. Not content yet, he will also have the Trojans to be"
18634,SECT. V.[875],Phryges:
18635,SECT. V.[875],
18636,SECT. V.[875],[903] Æn. iii. 104.
18637,SECT. V.[875],
18638,SECT. V.[875],[904] Æn. vi. 63.

18645,SECT. V.[875],
18646,SECT. V.[875],though in Homer the Phrygians are a people both ethnologically and
18647,SECT. V.[875],politically separate[907] from the Trojan races. Again as to Æneas
18648,SECT. V.[875],himself. He is called Rhæteius heros[908]; but if Virgil chose thus
18649,SECT. V.[875],to designate his hero by reference to a single point of the Trojan
18650,SECT. V.[875],"territory, it should have been one with which he was locally connected,"
18651,SECT. V.[875],whereas the dominions of his family were not near the promontory
18652,SECT. V.[875],"or upon the coast, but among the hills at the other extreme of the"
18653,SECT. V.[875],country. Then again Æneas is Laomedontius heros[909]; but Laomedon was
18654,SECT. V.[875],"of the branch of Ilus, while Æneas belonged to that of Assaracus; and"
18655,SECT. V.[875],"was moreover perjured, while the line of Assaracus was marked with no"
18656,SECT. V.[875],such taint. So we have again--

18670,SECT. V.[875],he had himself made Teucer the head of the race[911]. In describing the
18671,SECT. V.[875],"migration of this hero from Crete to Troas, he says:"

18674,SECT. V.[875],

18678,SECT. V.[875],[912] Æn. iii. 109.
18679,SECT. V.[875],
18680,SECT. V.[875],"Here he not only rejects Homer, who places Dardanus and the original"
18681,SECT. V.[875],"settlement among the mountains, but likewise represents what is in"
18682,SECT. V.[875],"itself improbable, since eminences, and not bottoms, were commonly"
18683,SECT. V.[875],sought by the first colonists with a view to security. Choosing to
18684,SECT. V.[875],"depart from Homer, he does not even agree with Apollodorus[913]."
18685,SECT. V.[875],"Lastly, he is not less neglectful of the actual topography; for he"
18686,SECT. V.[875],"implies that Ilium is among the hills, while it was, according to"
18687,SECT. V.[875],"Homer’s express words and according to universal opinion, on the plain"
18688,SECT. V.[875],as opposed to the hills. Again we have from Virgil the allusion--
18689,SECT. V.[875],
18690,SECT. V.[875],[913] Apollod. III. xii. 1.
18691,SECT. V.[875],

18695,SECT. V.[875],[914] Æn. vi. 63.
18696,SECT. V.[875],
18697,SECT. V.[875],"Here is another case of metre against history, and in all such"
18698,SECT. V.[875],cases history must go (as is said) to the wall. _Ilium_ would not
18699,SECT. V.[875],satisfactorily admit the genitive case; there could therefore be no
18700,SECT. V.[875],"glory of Ilium, and on this account Virgil liberally assigns vast"
18701,SECT. V.[875],"renown to Dardania, which was a place of no renown whatever. But he is"
18702,SECT. V.[875],"quite as ready, it must be admitted, to contradict himself as he is to"
18703,SECT. V.[875],"contradict Homer. In Æn. ii. 540, he gives it to be understood that the"
18704,SECT. V.[875],"city of Troy alone was the kingdom of Priam, and that the Greek camp"
18705,SECT. V.[875],"was beyond it, for he makes Priam say of his return from the camp,"

18707,SECT. V.[875],meque in mea regna remisit.
18708,SECT. V.[875],

18714,SECT. V.[875],"Each account is alike inaccurate: Priam had more than a city, but his"
18715,SECT. V.[875],"dominions were confined to a mere nook of Asia Minor. And again, before"
18716,SECT. V.[875],"quitting this part of the subject, let us observe how, in the case of"
18717,SECT. V.[875],"Anchises, he departs from Homer, even where it would have served the"
18718,SECT. V.[875],purpose of his story to follow him closely. The Anchises of Homer is
18719,SECT. V.[875],an ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν; he does not appear at Troy among the δημογέροντες of
18720,SECT. V.[875],"the city, or of Priam’s court, which would have made him a secondary"
18721,SECT. V.[875],"figure; he resides at Dardania as an independent sovereign, and it"
18722,SECT. V.[875],"seems not unlikely that in lineal dignity, at least, he was even before"
18723,SECT. V.[875],Priam. But the Anchises of Virgil is resident in Troy[915]; and is
18724,SECT. V.[875],"therefore, of course, to be taken for a subject of Priam. Here the"
18725,SECT. V.[875],"alteration very much lowers the rank of Æneas, and so far, therefore,"

18730,SECT. V.[875],"The effect of all this is, without any real gain either moral or"
18731,SECT. V.[875],"poetical, entirely to bewilder the mind of the reader of the Æneid, in"

18733,SECT. V.[875],with respect to which Homer has left on record a most careful and
18734,SECT. V.[875],"clear representation. It must indeed be admitted, that the intervening"
18735,SECT. V.[875],poets had set many examples of similar license; indeed they had made
18736,SECT. V.[875],irregularity a rule; but they had no such powerful reasons as Virgil
18737,SECT. V.[875],"had for imitating, in some points at least, the precision of Homer, and"
18738,SECT. V.[875],"besides, he has perhaps exceeded them all in the multitude and variety"
18739,SECT. V.[875],"of his departures from it. On the other hand, some allowance, I admit,"
18740,SECT. V.[875],"should be made for the less flexible character of the Latin tongue,"

18747,SECT. V.[875],"After the political and courtly idea of the poem, he seems to have"

18759,SECT. V.[875],"If we look to the action of the Twelfth Book of the Æneid, it is all"

18764,SECT. V.[875],"under the same instigation. Next, the flight of Turnus before Æneas is"
18765,SECT. V.[875],"borrowed from that of Hector before Achilles. After this, Turnus is"
18766,SECT. V.[875],"disabled by a divine agency, like Patroclus before Hector; a downfall"
18767,SECT. V.[875],"brought about in the one case, as in the other, without peril and"
18768,SECT. V.[875],"without honour, so that here we have a copy even of one among the"
18769,SECT. V.[875],"few points where the Iliad was little worthy to be imitated. Lastly,"
18770,SECT. V.[875],"the thought of Pallas in the mind of Æneas (more highly wrought,"

18783,SECT. V.[875],even here we may note two characteristic differences. Homer trips up a
18784,SECT. V.[875],"personage, whom he has no particular occasion to set off favourably."
18785,SECT. V.[875],"Virgil chooses for the object of derision Nisus, on whom, in the"
18786,SECT. V.[875],"beautiful episode which soon after follows, he is about to concentrate"
18787,SECT. V.[875],"all the tenderest sympathies of his hearers. And again, Homer makes"
18788,SECT. V.[875],"Ajax slip where, as he says, the oxen had just been slain over"
18789,SECT. V.[875],Patroclus: Virgil has no such probable cause to allege for the presence
18790,SECT. V.[875],"of the obnoxious material[918], but says _cæsis forte juvencis_. Now"
18791,SECT. V.[875],"the Trojans had in fact left the tomb of Anchises, and had gone to a"
18792,SECT. V.[875],chosen spot to celebrate the foot-races[919]; so that even his gore and
18793,SECT. V.[875],ordure are quite out of place.

18825,SECT. V.[875],"touching, and remarkably original portrait to a gross and most common"
18826,SECT. V.[875],"caricature. But Ulysses, as the prince of policy, had perhaps a better"
18827,SECT. V.[875],claim to be comprehended by a Roman at the court of Augustus. Yet
18828,SECT. V.[875],"the Ulysses of Virgil simply represents the naked ideas of hardness,"
18829,SECT. V.[875],"cunning, and cruelty. He is never named but to be abused; and, though"
18830,SECT. V.[875],"the mention of him is not very frequent, it is easy to construct from"
18831,SECT. V.[875],"the poem a pretty large catalogue of vituperative epithets, unmitigated"
18832,SECT. V.[875],"by any single one of an opposite character. He is _durus_, _dirus_,"
18833,SECT. V.[875],"_sævus_, _pellax_, _fandi fictor_, _artifex_, _inventor scelerum_, and"
18834,SECT. V.[875],"_scelerum hortator_. Even physical circumstances, however, and those"
18835,SECT. V.[875],"too of the broadest notoriety, Virgil entirely overlooks. Nothing can"
18836,SECT. V.[875],"be more at variance with the effeminate character of the Homeric Paris,"
18837,SECT. V.[875],"his impotence in fight, and his distinction limited to the bow, which"
18838,SECT. V.[875],"was then the coward’s weapon, than to represent him as possessed of"

18899,SECT. V.[875],stamps with the authority of a deity: what Priam says of the Homeric
18900,SECT. V.[875],"Helen, who had been carried off by Paris, and whose general character"
18901,SECT. V.[875],"was very far from depraved, the Venus of Virgil says of a hardened"

18903,SECT. V.[875],"himself, ‘_I_ do not blame thee,’ seems in the Æneid to resemble the"

18907,SECT. V.[875],"as moral guilt upon earth, there could be no doubt, and whom Homer,"

18911,SECT. V.[875],"upon the Immortals, by the mouth, too, of one belonging to their"

18925,SECT. V.[875],"Virgil with a hemistich to fill up a gap in an extremely fine passage,"

19035,SECT. V.[875],"force of all the less conspicuous delineations: Hecuba, Briseis, the"
19036,SECT. V.[875],"incomparable Nausicaa, the faithful Euryclea, the pert and heartless"
19037,SECT. V.[875],Melantho. But how different are the works of the two poets! In all
19038,SECT. V.[875],Virgil’s women (as on the other hand his men are apt to be effeminate)
19039,SECT. V.[875],there is a tinge of the masculine. Many a woman would stab herself for
19040,SECT. V.[875],"love like Dido; but none, not even in France, with her pomp, apparatus,"
19041,SECT. V.[875],"and self-consciousness. Their fates, too, are all of a violent"
19042,SECT. V.[875],"character. Amata, as well as Dido, commits suicide; Camilla is slain;"
19043,SECT. V.[875],"Juturna is immortal indeed, but is dismissed from earth with what for"
19044,SECT. V.[875],"her comes nearest to an image of death; with defeat, mortification,"
19045,SECT. V.[875],"shame. But on the contrary, the feminineness of Homer’s women has never"
19046,SECT. V.[875],"been surpassed. In Hecuba alone, at one single point in the story,"
19047,SECT. V.[875],there is an apparent exception; yet it is no great violence done to
19048,SECT. V.[875],"nature, if we find in her after Hector’s death the wild ferocity of"
19049,SECT. V.[875],"the dam deprived of her offspring, and if revenge then drives her for"
19050,SECT. V.[875],"a moment into the temper of a cannibal. Elsewhere beyond doubt, even"
19051,SECT. V.[875],"in Melantho, the feminine character is not wholly obliterated, but is"
19052,SECT. V.[875],left at the point where in actual life licentiousness and vanity might
19053,SECT. V.[875],"leave it. In Helen, Andromache, Nausicaa, it reaches a perfection which"
19054,SECT. V.[875],"has never been surpassed, unless by Shakespeare, in human song. There"
19055,SECT. V.[875],"is, however, something to be observed, which is more striking and"

19057,SECT. V.[875],"nothing, or next to nothing, of the social position of womankind either"

19062,SECT. V.[875],picture of this interesting subject not a whit less complete than any
19063,SECT. V.[875],other picture they contain. The Woman of the heroic age of Greece
19064,SECT. V.[875],"stands before us in that immortal verse no less clear, no less truly"

19361,SECT. V.[875],"rather than any other Italian poet, I have to confess, that as far as"
19362,SECT. V.[875],"the qualities of the men are concerned, both Bojardo and Ariosto are in"
19363,SECT. V.[875],my estimation more Homeric than Tasso; as being nearer to nature in its
19364,SECT. V.[875],"truest sense, as not conveying the same impression of perpetual effort"
19365,SECT. V.[875],"and elaboration, as exempt from the temptation to the conceits so"

19393,SECT. V.[875],"ranks at least among the most wonderful of all the works of Homer, is"
19394,SECT. V.[875],"colossal and vast, but is not unduly exaggerated. Although the son of"

19397,SECT. V.[875],"they suggest a predominance of the animal over the incorporeal element,"
19398,SECT. V.[875],"which, in the case of Achilles, the Poet utterly eschews. The character"
19399,SECT. V.[875],of Rinaldo as a warrior (and in no other respect does he present any
19400,SECT. V.[875],"salient point) is, as will be shown, exaggerated unduly, but yet does"

19603,SECT. V.[875],"Will it be answered, that in the same manner Achilles disappears"
19604,SECT. V.[875],from the eye of the spectator during one moiety of the Iliad? The
19605,SECT. V.[875],apparent parallel is wholly false. For the subject of the Iliad is
19606,SECT. V.[875],the passion of Achilles; and the whole movement of the poem in his
19607,SECT. V.[875],absence bears directly upon the enhancement and elevation of that
19608,SECT. V.[875],"subject. It exhibits to us the successive efforts of the Greeks, and"
19609,SECT. V.[875],"of their most redoubted chieftains, one by one, to make up for the"
19610,SECT. V.[875],seclusion of Achilles from the fighting host. It was impossible for
19611,SECT. V.[875],"Homer more effectually to magnify his hero, than by recounting fully"
19612,SECT. V.[875],these exploits and their failure. In showing the perils and calamities
19613,SECT. V.[875],"brought about by his absence, they deeply impress us with the grandeur"
19614,SECT. V.[875],"and efficacy of his presence, and prepare us for the reappearance of"
19615,SECT. V.[875],"something more than man: of something which, but for a most skilful"
19616,SECT. V.[875],"preparatory mechanism, we should probably have repelled as an unnatural"
19617,SECT. V.[875],exaggeration. But the love-born vagaries of the warriors of Tasso are
19618,SECT. V.[875],"mere impediments to the conquest of Jerusalem, and have no effect"
19619,SECT. V.[875],whatever in enhancing the poetical greatness of the achievement which
19620,SECT. V.[875],"was to crown the work, while they seriously deduct from the power and"
19621,SECT. V.[875],"effectiveness, already in the case of Rinaldo but moderate, of the"
19622,SECT. V.[875],characters assigned to the warriors themselves.
19623,SECT. V.[875],
19624,SECT. V.[875],"It may therefore be true, as Mr. Hallam has said, that the events"
19625,SECT. V.[875],in Tasso spring naturally one from another; but so may a series of
19626,SECT. V.[875],"successive turnings off the line of a road we have been travelling,"
19627,SECT. V.[875],"when taken singly, produce no serious, and even no sensible, deviation;"
19628,SECT. V.[875],"yet their effect, when taken together, may be wholly to change our"
19629,SECT. V.[875],"direction, and prevent us from making any way at all towards our point."
19630,SECT. V.[875],"Without doubt, each incident of an epic poem ought to follow naturally"
19631,SECT. V.[875],in the train of that which directly precedes it; but it is far more
19632,SECT. V.[875],important that it should bear a legitimate relation to the central
19633,SECT. V.[875],"design, and should magnify, not detract from, the grandeur of that on"
19634,SECT. V.[875],which the whole fabric principally depends.
19635,SECT. V.[875],
19636,SECT. V.[875],"But there are surely many other objections to the mode, which Tasso"
19637,SECT. V.[875],"has adopted, of impeding and retarding the accomplishment of his main"
19638,SECT. V.[875],"action. Considering the nature of his theme, and the solemnity of the"
19639,SECT. V.[875],"sanctions under which the Crusades were undertaken, although we have"
19640,SECT. V.[875],no right to ask that passion and infirmity should be banished from the
19641,SECT. V.[875],"camp, yet the wholesale entanglement of the very first warriors in"
19642,SECT. V.[875],"love affairs, their rushing in a mass, with few exceptions besides"
19643,SECT. V.[875],"greyheads of the camp, upon the track of Armida, their compelling"
19644,SECT. V.[875],Godfrey to allow the interests of this treacherous beauty to interrupt
19645,SECT. V.[875],"the august purpose of their undertaking, and then the very large"
19646,SECT. V.[875],"proportion of the poem occupied in unravelling the web thus tangled,"
19647,SECT. V.[875],"form, to my view at least, a bad poetical mixture of the intrusive with"

19652,SECT. V.[875],We need not dwell on such distinctions as that Briseis was a noble and
19653,SECT. V.[875],"worthy, but Armida an unworthy object of attachment; that Achilles was"
19654,SECT. V.[875],"but one, while Tasso touches all, who by age were capable, with the"
19655,SECT. V.[875],"same phrensy. It is not even this worthy attachment alone, that acts"
19656,SECT. V.[875],upon Achilles: that is not the main stress of the tempest which so

19667,SECT. V.[875],"his hatred of the meanness of Agamemnon, and his sense of Justice,"
19668,SECT. V.[875],"stung to the very inmost quick. Even supposing the question to be open,"
19669,SECT. V.[875],"whether Homer has mixed his ingredients in due or in undue proportions,"
19670,SECT. V.[875],at all events there is no essential conflict among them. But such a

19673,SECT. V.[875],"to the highest aim, such as it is quite impossible to exemplify, nay to"

19679,SECT. V.[875],sympathies and interest by means of his accessory circumstances round
19680,SECT. V.[875],"his principal subject, he has too effectually severed them from it,"
19681,SECT. V.[875],"and has left it so bare and naked, that his liberation of Jerusalem"
19682,SECT. V.[875],"is after all very like a common capture and sack; very like what,"

19686,SECT. V.[875],"names suggest, connect themselves with any subject, rather than with"
19687,SECT. V.[875],"the liberation of the Holy Sepulchre; and the respected Godfrey, with"
19688,SECT. V.[875],"his plans, has, at most points of the poem, little more share in our"
19689,SECT. V.[875],"thoughts than the Jupiter of the Iliad, as he feasts remotely grand on"
19690,SECT. V.[875],"Olympus, or sits on Ida for the convenience of a nearer view."

19694,SECT. V.[875],"Besides these objections of irrelevant interpolation, incongruous"
19695,SECT. V.[875],"mixture, and divided interests, it may be observed that the relative"
19696,SECT. V.[875],prominence of the heroes of Tasso is not clearly pronounced. No one
19697,SECT. V.[875],"can doubt as to the question, who is the first, and by far the first,"
19698,SECT. V.[875],"figure of the Iliad. Achilles ever haunts us, either in recollection"
19699,SECT. V.[875],"or by sight; at any rate, he stands among and above his brother"
19700,SECT. V.[875],"chieftains, as Saul out-topped by head and shoulders the people of"
19701,SECT. V.[875],Israel. But it is not easy to say who is the hero or protagonist of
19702,SECT. V.[875],"the Jerusalem. Although the interest which he attracts is inferior,"
19703,SECT. V.[875],"yet the virtues, intellect, and moral force of Godfrey stand high"
19704,SECT. V.[875],and clear beyond those of all the other more prominent personages:
19705,SECT. V.[875],"he bears himself so meekly in his high office, and yet so perfectly"
19706,SECT. V.[875],"and so exclusively exhibits the political spirit, that by mere moral"
19707,SECT. V.[875],"and official greatness he stands, in any general view of the poem, an"
19708,SECT. V.[875],"inconvenient neighbour and a dangerous rival to the two other figures,"
19709,SECT. V.[875],"for one of whom the title of hero must have been designed. Taking,"
19710,SECT. V.[875],"next, the yet more serious question between Tancredi and Rinaldo, which"
19711,SECT. V.[875],"of this pair is intended to command the chief interest? Apparently,"
19712,SECT. V.[875],"in Tasso’s intention, it is Rinaldo; because without him the main"
19713,SECT. V.[875],"action stops, with him it proceeds. And yet the poet has assigned to"
19714,SECT. V.[875],"Tancredi the deadly single combat with, and the triumph so powerfully"
19715,SECT. V.[875],"described over, Argante, the only really great and terrible champion on"
19716,SECT. V.[875],"the Mahometan side. How would the Iliad stand, if Diomed had killed"
19717,SECT. V.[875],"Hector, and had left to Achilles only Æneas or Sarpedon?"
19718,SECT. V.[875],
19719,SECT. V.[875],"Tasso here seems himself to have felt an incongruity, and to have"
19720,SECT. V.[875],sought to compensate Rinaldo in quantity for the (comparatively)
19721,SECT. V.[875],deficient quality of his conquests. In the final assault he slays a
19722,SECT. V.[875],"multitude of the enemy like sheep[961]; when, as the poet says, in a"
19723,SECT. V.[875],"manner surely far beneath his theme, the taste of victory had excited"

19759,SECT. V.[875],"so, that at times we almost seem to be reading a Pastoral poem. Taken"
19760,SECT. V.[875],"singly, the details of these love-stories are worked up with infinite"
19761,SECT. V.[875],"art and beauty, and are the most effective and successful portions of"
19762,SECT. V.[875],"the whole Epic; but the aggregate is so much too large, that it chills"
19763,SECT. V.[875],"the general tone, as well as weakens the broader effects. The excess"
19764,SECT. V.[875],"of quantity is, indeed, gross and glaring. Tasso has followed the"
19765,SECT. V.[875],"Christian Romancers in employing largely the idea of the woman-warrior,"
19766,SECT. V.[875],"practically unknown to Homer, introduced with great spirit but no very"
19767,SECT. V.[875],"elevated moral effect in Virgil, carried by Bojardo and Ariosto to its"
19768,SECT. V.[875],"perfection; and, without doubt, a conception far more suitable to the"
19769,SECT. V.[875],"standard of those great poets of fancy, than to the lofty level of the"
19770,SECT. V.[875],"Epic or the higher drama, which deal with the greatest powers and the"
19771,SECT. V.[875],"deepest problems of our nature. Still, as to the manner of employing"
19772,SECT. V.[875],"it, we need not deny that high praise must be accorded to the Clorinda"
19773,SECT. V.[875],of Tasso. It is indeed easy to criticize the religious incidents of her
19774,SECT. V.[875],"death, and not easy to understand what business she has after death"
19775,SECT. V.[875],"in a tree of the enchanted wood; or why, when that wood becomes the"
19776,SECT. V.[875],"prey of the carpenters, she is so unceremoniously overlooked in her"
19777,SECT. V.[875],"uncomfortable abode. But as to the main exhibition of the character,"
19778,SECT. V.[875],"she follows Bradamante without degeneracy: pure, upright, chivalrous,"
19779,SECT. V.[875],"thoroughly martial, and yet not grossly masculine. She falls to"
19780,SECT. V.[875],"the lot of Tancred. But besides the Sofronia, the Erminia, and the"
19781,SECT. V.[875],"Gildippe, in the second degree of prominence, there is projected on"
19782,SECT. V.[875],"the picture another person yet more conspicuous than even Clorinda,"
19783,SECT. V.[875],"namely, Armida; so different that they can hardly be compared, and yet"
19784,SECT. V.[875],inconveniently jarring from the similarity of their relations to the
19785,SECT. V.[875],"great heroes of the poem. Both, too, are lovely; both figure in the"
19786,SECT. V.[875],"camp. Notwithstanding, however, the profusion of charms, which Tasso"
19787,SECT. V.[875],has called into existence to set off the person and the powers of
19788,SECT. V.[875],"Armida, nothing can be more unsatisfactory than her character itself,"

19791,SECT. V.[875],"remains insensible: and yet afterwards, with no poetical justification"

19793,SECT. V.[875],"that feebleness in the conception and exhibition of character, which"
19794,SECT. V.[875],"depresses the flight of Tasso, which excludes him from a place in the"

19803,SECT. V.[875],assigned to her. Then she appears as the Circe of her own gardens:
19804,SECT. V.[875],"then she is a Dido without an Æneas, for the escape of Rinaldo from"
19805,SECT. V.[875],the disgraceful servitude into which she had inveigled him bears no
19806,SECT. V.[875],"resemblance to the fond and deep passion of the Carthaginian queen,"

19814,SECT. V.[875],"her keenest longings for revenge, Armida has recourse to an expedient"
19815,SECT. V.[875],which is wholly debased and vulgar. She simply offers herself for
19816,SECT. V.[875],"sale, promising to be the prize of any warrior of the Egyptian camp,"

19882,SECT. V.[875],"direction of the Almighty, in the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre from"
19883,SECT. V.[875],"infidel dominion. With all these circumstances before us, it must"
19884,SECT. V.[875],be admitted that a more lame and unsatisfactory contribution to the

19886,SECT. V.[875],Nor is the impression much amended by the dedication of the eight
19887,SECT. V.[875],last stanzas of the work to the completion of the victory by Godfrey.
19888,SECT. V.[875],"A reader may, on the contrary, well feel perturbed by the sharpness"
19889,SECT. V.[875],"of the transition, and by the air of unconsciousness with which, in"
19890,SECT. V.[875],"gathering up the threads of the action, Tasso has brought into close"
19891,SECT. V.[875],"neighbourhood matters so heterogeneous, that they form a kind of moral"
19892,SECT. V.[875],"chaos. And the observation applies to the close of the poem, which may"
19893,SECT. V.[875],well have accompanied it throughout its course; that the sympathies of
19894,SECT. V.[875],"the reader are not evoked and managed with due, or with any, reference"
19895,SECT. V.[875],"to the greatness and nobleness of the objects, but, on the contrary,"
19896,SECT. V.[875],"are allured into the wrong quarter. Homer has carefully contrived, in"
19897,SECT. V.[875],"the case of Paris, that even his extraordinary personal attractions"
19898,SECT. V.[875],"shall do nothing to give him a hold upon our favour, while he has"
19899,SECT. V.[875],"given his warmest sympathies to the beauty of the innocent, though"
19900,SECT. V.[875],"comparatively insignificant, Euphorbus[968]. How tame and flat, on"
19901,SECT. V.[875],"the contrary, has Tasso made the stainless Erminia, whom indeed he"
19902,SECT. V.[875],altogether forgets before the poem closes; and what efforts of art has
19903,SECT. V.[875],he not used to gather admiring interest around the character and fate
19904,SECT. V.[875],"of the heartless, even when enamoured, Armida. Nay, more, with some"
19905,SECT. V.[875],"brilliant exceptions, especially that noble one of the first view of"
19906,SECT. V.[875],"Jerusalem, how cold and slack, how uninteresting to the reader, is the"
19907,SECT. V.[875],"movement of the main action of the poem, compared with that of the"
19908,SECT. V.[875],love-stories which invade and engross so inordinate a portion of the
19909,SECT. V.[875],"ground. We seem to feel that, after all, the Siege of Jerusalem is not"
19910,SECT. V.[875],the principal business in hand; it is the task which must somehow or
19911,SECT. V.[875],"other be got through, but it is not the life and pulse, the light and"
19912,SECT. V.[875],"joy of the poem. As the Siege of Troy was the instrument of Homer, to"
19913,SECT. V.[875],"enable him to develop his Achilles, so the much higher subject of the"
19914,SECT. V.[875],"Crusade is the tool of Tasso to enable him to exhibit his workmanship,"

19984,SECT. V.[875],"his fingers, playing instinctively on the handle of his sword, cause"
19985,SECT. V.[875],"its blade to be seen, comes the warning vision of Pallas to him, and to"

19987,SECT. V.[875],"and, his inward wound assuaged with the promise of a future revenge, to"
19988,SECT. V.[875],be wrought out for him by the self-condemning hands of the inflicters

20014,SECT. V.[875],"namely, in the stanzas 8-10 of the First Canto. He here places before"
20015,SECT. V.[875],"us Godfrey, Baldwin, Tancred, Boemondo, and Rinaldo; and he resumes"
20016,SECT. V.[875],from time to time the business of describing them. Bojardo and
20017,SECT. V.[875],Ariosto avoid this; but it is probably because they were dealing with
20018,SECT. V.[875],"characters of well-known type, already familiar to their audience."
20019,SECT. V.[875],"Homer, who drew so much more powerfully, had more to describe than"
20020,SECT. V.[875],any of them. And yet it may be said he never describes characters at
20021,SECT. V.[875],"all, with the very slight exceptions of Nestor, in a few words, and"
20022,SECT. V.[875],"Thersites with somewhat more detail: the latter, it is evident, because"

20024,SECT. V.[875],exhibiting which in action he could not afford to such a wretch any
20025,SECT. V.[875],"extended space: the former, perhaps because he has thought it better"
20026,SECT. V.[875],for effect to abstain from marking him through the poem by distinctive
20027,SECT. V.[875],"epithets, and could produce a certain roundness of figure, highly"
20028,SECT. V.[875],"suitable to the personage, in this way with more convenience. But, in"
20029,SECT. V.[875],"general, Homer’s characters are described by their actions only, with"
20030,SECT. V.[875],"the aid of choice and characteristic epithets, and here and there of"
20031,SECT. V.[875],"some small but pointed allusion, not from themselves nor from the Poet,"
20032,SECT. V.[875],but in the speeches of others. Thus he grapples with the full scale of
20033,SECT. V.[875],the demands of the dramatic art. Others could not follow him. We must
20034,SECT. V.[875],not blame Tasso for a proceeding quite necessary by way of clue to his
20035,SECT. V.[875],"poem; rather, indeed, we should praise the ingenious manner in which he"
20036,SECT. V.[875],"has effected his purpose, by a survey which the Almighty takes of the"
20037,SECT. V.[875],Christian camp; a proceeding alike conducive to the religious character
20038,SECT. V.[875],"of his poem, not always so well cared for, and to the supply of the"

20043,SECT. V.[875],to Homer. At least we may be disposed to think he has nothing so
20044,SECT. V.[875],unsatisfactory under this head as the death of Patroclus. It may
20045,SECT. V.[875],be another question how far he is indebted for instruction in this
20046,SECT. V.[875],"department to his great countrymen, especially Ariosto, and also"
20047,SECT. V.[875],whether he has anywhere equalled the magnificent account of that

20054,SECT. V.[875],of Tasso’s similes are extremely beautiful and finished; and he has
20055,SECT. V.[875],followed Homer in employing them to relieve the narrative of battle;
20056,SECT. V.[875],but he has not observed the same judicious parsimony in other parts of
20057,SECT. V.[875],"his poem; he has apparently not perceived, certainly not followed, the"
20058,SECT. V.[875],"general rules of Homer in the distribution of this ornament, and the"
20059,SECT. V.[875],result has been that they produce a somewhat cloying effect.
20060,SECT. V.[875],
20061,SECT. V.[875],"Like Virgil, he has been betrayed into imitating Homer in certain"
20062,SECT. V.[875],"cases, where the whole reason of the case was changed: as, for"
20063,SECT. V.[875],"instance, in the Invocation before the Catalogue, and in the wish"
20064,SECT. V.[875],"expressed for multiplied organs of speech. To Homer, a reciting poet,"
20065,SECT. V.[875],"the Catalogue was a great effort of memory, and it therefore justified"
20066,SECT. V.[875],the special application to the Muse: to Tasso it must have been one of
20067,SECT. V.[875],"the easier parts of his performance. As respects the second point, what"
20068,SECT. V.[875],can be more reasonable in the case of an unwritten composition? what
20069,SECT. V.[875],"less so, when the poet works with pen and ink? Nor is the case much"
20070,SECT. V.[875],"mended by supposing that Tasso had in mind his recitations, unless the"
20071,SECT. V.[875],"recitation had been, not the accident, but the rule, so that the poem"
20072,SECT. V.[875],"would itself, in the ordinary course of thought, be conceived of as"
20073,SECT. V.[875],associated with the act of reciting.

20075,SECT. V.[875],"Tasso seems, however, to have fallen into a more serious error in"
20076,SECT. V.[875],introducing a Second Catalogue into his poem. The first may be defended
20077,SECT. V.[875],"by the same reasoning, which so amply warrants that of Homer. But what"

20083,SECT. V.[875],"If in the Jerusalem the Wrath is beneath the standard of the Iliad,"
20084,SECT. V.[875],"so is the Return. On the side of Rinaldo, indeed, it is most just and"
20085,SECT. V.[875],"right, that he should be extricated from the entanglements of the"
20086,SECT. V.[875],"seductive Armida: but, on the side of Godfrey, there is the same sorry"
20087,SECT. V.[875],"management of all the moral elements of the case. In Homer, Achilles"
20088,SECT. V.[875],was justly and most deeply offended: on every principle known to the
20089,SECT. V.[875],"creed of Paganism, or to Greek life and experience, he justly resented"
20090,SECT. V.[875],the offence: the utmost that can be imputed to him is a decided excess
20091,SECT. V.[875],in the indulgence of a thoroughly righteous feeling: and this was
20092,SECT. V.[875],"terribly expiated by the bloody death of that friend, who was to him"
20093,SECT. V.[875],as a second self. But the gross offence of Agamemnon is dealt with
20094,SECT. V.[875],according to the most righteous rules; and he is compelled by word
20095,SECT. V.[875],"and gift to appease the man whom he had robbed, insulted, and striven"
20096,SECT. V.[875],"to degrade. While he is brought both to restitution and to apology,"
20097,SECT. V.[875],how different is the arrangement of Tasso’s poem! Rinaldo was wronged
20098,SECT. V.[875],by Gernando: but Godfrey had done no more than his duty: he was the
20099,SECT. V.[875],"minister of public justice, of lawful authority, and of military"
20100,SECT. V.[875],"discipline: in respect to him, and likewise in respect to the army,"
20101,SECT. V.[875],"Rinaldo was the offender, Godfrey and public right were only the"
20102,SECT. V.[875],sufferers; yet Godfrey and public right give way under the pressure of

20104,SECT. V.[875],
20105,SECT. V.[875],If it has been found possible in the case of Virgil to institute a more
20106,SECT. V.[875],"minute comparison with Homer, this cannot be attempted in the case"
20107,SECT. V.[875],"of Tasso, for his work hardly admits of juxta-positions in detail."
20108,SECT. V.[875],We have already noticed the abundant stock of real analogies between
20109,SECT. V.[875],"the subject of the Trojan expedition, and that of the Crusades."
20110,SECT. V.[875],"Tasso himself, in his anxiety to follow Homer, even added to them, by"
20111,SECT. V.[875],"feigning a centralization of the Christian enterprise, which I fear did"
20112,SECT. V.[875],"not really exist. But to imitate is one thing, to be like is another;"
20113,SECT. V.[875],"and it still remains hard really to compare the poems, far harder the"
20114,SECT. V.[875],"poets. In order to see this clearly, let us ascend a height, and view"
20115,SECT. V.[875],the scene which lies before us. How vast a deluge of time and of events
20116,SECT. V.[875],"has swept away the very world in which Homer lived, and the worlds that"
20117,SECT. V.[875],"succeeded his: the place of nativity is changed, the great gulf of time"
20118,SECT. V.[875],"is stretched between, the language is another, the religion new, all"
20119,SECT. V.[875],"the chains of association have been taken to pieces and re-forged, all"
20120,SECT. V.[875],"the old chords of feeling are now mute, and others that give forth a"
20121,SECT. V.[875],"different music are strung in their stead. And there is also, it must"
20122,SECT. V.[875],"be confessed, a great and sharp descent from the stature of Homer, as a"
20123,SECT. V.[875],"creative poet, to that of Tasso. Yet he too is a classic of Italy, and"
20124,SECT. V.[875],a classic of the world; and if for a moment we feel it a disparagement
20125,SECT. V.[875],"to his country that she suffers in this one comparison, let her soothe"
20126,SECT. V.[875],"her ruffled recollection by the consciousness, that though Tasso has"
20127,SECT. V.[875],"not become a rival to Homer, yet he shares this failure with every epic"
20128,SECT. V.[875],"writer of every land. On the other hand, no modern poet, dealing with"
20129,SECT. V.[875],"similar subject-matter, has been equal to Tasso. None has erected,"
20130,SECT. V.[875],"upon similar foundations to his, a fabric so lofty and so durable, so"
20131,SECT. V.[875],"rich in beauty and in grace: so well entitled, if not to vie with the"
20132,SECT. V.[875],"very greatest achievement of the ages that went before him, at least"
20133,SECT. V.[875],to challenge or to win the admiration of those generations that have
20134,SECT. V.[875],"succeeded. But his defeat is, after all, his greatest victory. To lose"
20135,SECT. V.[875],the match against Homer is a higher prize than to win it from his other
20136,SECT. V.[875],"competitors. Few indeed are the sons of genius, and elect among the"
20137,SECT. V.[875],"elect, who can be brought into comparison with that sire and king of"

20152,SECTION VI.,
20153,SECTION VI.,To one only among the countless millions of human beings has it been
20154,SECTION VI.,"given to draw characters, by the strength of his own individual hand,"
20155,SECTION VI.,"in lines of such force and vigour, that they have become, from his"
20156,SECTION VI.,"day to our own, the common inheritance of civilized man. That one is"
20157,SECTION VI.,"Homer. Ever since his time, besides finding his way into the usually"
20158,SECTION VI.,"impenetrable East, he has provided literary capital and available stock"
20159,SECTION VI.,"in trade for reciters and hearers, for authors and readers of all times"
20160,SECTION VI.,and of all places within the limits of the Western world;
20161,SECTION VI.,
20162,SECTION VI.,"Adjice Mæoniden, a quo, ceu fonte perenni,"
20163,SECTION VI.,Vatum Pieriis ora rigantur aquis.
20164,SECTION VI.,
20165,SECTION VI.,"Like the sun, which furnishes with its light the close courts and"
20166,SECTION VI.,"alleys of London, while himself unseen by their inhabitants, Homer has"
20167,SECTION VI.,supplied with the illumination of his ideas millions of minds that were
20168,SECTION VI.,"never brought into direct contact with his works, and even millions"
20169,SECTION VI.,"more, that have hardly been aware of his existence. As the full flow of"
20170,SECTION VI.,his genius has opened itself out into ten thousand irrigating channels
20171,SECTION VI.,"by successive subdivision, there can be no cause for wonder, if some"
20172,SECTION VI.,of them have not preserved the pellucid clearness of the stream. Like
20173,SECTION VI.,"blood from the great artery of the heart of man, as it returns through"
20174,SECTION VI.,"innumerable veins, it is gradually darkened in its flow. The very"
20175,SECTION VI.,universality of the tradition has multiplied the causes of corruption.
20176,SECTION VI.,"That which, as to documents, is a guarantee, because their errors"
20177,SECTION VI.,"correct one another, as to ideas is a new source of danger, because"
20178,SECTION VI.,every thing depends upon constant reference to the finer touches of
20179,SECTION VI.,"an original, which has escaped from view. And this universality is his"
20180,SECTION VI.,alone. An Englishman may pardonably think that his great rival in the
20181,SECTION VI.,"portraiture of character is Shakespeare--a Briton may even go further,"
20182,SECTION VI.,"and challenge, on behalf of Sir Walter Scott, a place in this princely"
20183,SECTION VI.,"choir, second to no other person but these. Yet the fame of Hamlet,"
20184,SECTION VI.,"Othello, Lady Macbeth, or Falstaff, and much more that of Varney, or"
20185,SECTION VI.,"Ravenswood, or Caleb Balderston, or Meg Merrilies, has not yet come,"
20186,SECTION VI.,"and may never come, to be a world-wide fame. On the other hand, that"
20187,SECTION VI.,distinction has long been inalienably secured to every character of the
20188,SECTION VI.,"first class, who appears in the Homeric poems. He has conferred upon"
20189,SECTION VI.,them a deathless inheritance.
20190,SECTION VI.,
20191,SECTION VI.,"But, through waywardness and infirmity, mankind corrupts that with"
20192,SECTION VI.,"which it sympathizes, and undermines what it obeys. The same law of"
20193,SECTION VI.,"waste and decomposition, which from day to day corrodes the works of"
20194,SECTION VI.,"nature, operates also in divers manners and degrees upon the creations"
20195,SECTION VI.,"of mind. As the portraitures of individual character, to be found in"
20196,SECTION VI.,"the works of the great masters of the imaginative faculty, are among"
20197,SECTION VI.,"the very highest of these creations, so, because they are the greatest,"
20198,SECTION VI.,"they are the most difficult to render into other forms, and to"
20199,SECTION VI.,transfuse through new media. Among the ancient sculptures it is easier
20200,SECTION VI.,"to find a good Faun than a good Venus, while again those works, which"
20201,SECTION VI.,"embody the very highest ideals, are not only rare, but are in most"
20202,SECTION VI.,"instances unique. In like manner the Punch and the Harlequin, the broad"
20203,SECTION VI.,"characters of primitive spectacle and farce, readily become national,"
20204,SECTION VI.,"and are transmitted, spontaneously as it were, through ages without"
20205,SECTION VI.,"substantial change; but the finer and nobler representations of man,"
20206,SECTION VI.,"requiring greater effort, and a different order of mind to comprehend,"
20207,SECTION VI.,"as well as to project them, rapidly degenerate in the very points on"
20208,SECTION VI.,which their peculiar excellence depends.
20209,SECTION VI.,
20210,SECTION VI.,"Other causes, besides mental impotence in the recipient, contribute"
20211,SECTION VI.,"towards this result. One main agent is, the inability or the"
20212,SECTION VI.,"disinclination of mankind to go back to originals. For the mass, a"
20213,SECTION VI.,"modernizing process is commonly in demand, is readily furnished,"
20214,SECTION VI.,and is itself again and again varied from age to age. It is always
20215,SECTION VI.,"easier to derive from what is itself derivative, than to go up to"
20216,SECTION VI.,"the fountain-head. Into the business of every profession, including"
20217,SECTION VI.,"(now more than ever) that of letters, necessity drives her adamantine"
20218,SECTION VI.,"clamps: and the βάναυσον and the φορτικὸν, or slang and the clap-trap,"
20219,SECTION VI.,maintain a too successful struggle to depress its higher and more
20220,SECTION VI.,genial aims.
20221,SECTION VI.,
20222,SECTION VI.,~_Causes of injury to Homeric characters._~
20223,SECTION VI.,
20224,SECTION VI.,It is not difficult to point out reasons why the characters of Homer
20225,SECTION VI.,should have been peculiarly exposed to injury from the lapse of time.
20226,SECTION VI.,Most of all from two causes; because they were of such extraordinary
20227,SECTION VI.,"and refined merit, and because of the form in which they were conveyed."
20228,SECTION VI.,Not only did they bear the stamp that the highest genius alone could
20229,SECTION VI.,"affix, but nothing less than care, sympathy, and manly effort, could"
20230,SECTION VI.,enable men to comprehend them. For they were not exhibited in the set
20231,SECTION VI.,"forms of descriptive passages, which might be learnt by rote, but they"
20232,SECTION VI.,"were wrought out in the fine, as well as deep and strong lines of life"
20233,SECTION VI.,"and action; and none of them could be defined in terms, until they had"
20234,SECTION VI.,first been profoundly felt within. We were to become acquainted with
20235,SECTION VI.,"them as friends, by living with them through their varied fortunes; not"
20236,SECTION VI.,"as strangers, by some letter of introduction, that sets forth their"
20237,SECTION VI.,"birth, parentage, calling, and qualifications. For earnest and hearty"
20238,SECTION VI.,attention they provided the richest possible reward; by the careless
20239,SECTION VI.,"they were to be enjoyed indeed, but scarcely to be apprehended. To"
20240,SECTION VI.,"the eyes of such men there is little or nothing to discriminate, as"
20241,SECTION VI.,"between Agamemnon, Ajax, Diomed, Menelaus, and Patroclus; and if Nestor"
20242,SECTION VI.,"is a good deal older, Ulysses a good deal more cunning, and Achilles"
20243,SECTION VI.,"even more valiant than the rest, a single touch disposes of these"
20244,SECTION VI.,"differences, and enables us to reduce all the eight nearly to a common"
20245,SECTION VI.,type. A prior examination of particular instances will best prepare
20246,SECTION VI.,"us for weighing the force of those other causes, besides the weakness"
20247,SECTION VI.,"of human nature, and the excellence of the works in the general sense"
20248,SECTION VI.,"of the words, that contributed to depress and deface the Homeric"
20249,SECTION VI.,characters.
20250,SECTION VI.,
20251,SECTION VI.,"In the present Section, then, I propose to invite attention to a few"
20252,SECTION VI.,"Homeric characters, as they stand in the poems, which, as far as I am"
20253,SECTION VI.,"able to judge, stand in need as yet of further elucidation."
20254,SECTION VI.,
20255,SECTION VI.,Perhaps there is no one particular in which Colonel Mure has rendered
20256,SECTION VI.,"such important service to the modern Homeridæ, as in his account of"
20257,SECTION VI.,"the Homeric characters. In general, I shall best discharge my duty by"
20258,SECTION VI.,"simply referring the reader to his pages. I venture, however, to think,"
20259,SECTION VI.,that while the paramount subject of the great Grecian characters is
20260,SECTION VI.,"incomparably handled by him throughout, some exception may be taken to"
20261,SECTION VI.,"his representation of a part of the Trojan personages; of Hector, for"
20262,SECTION VI.,"example, and more particularly (if she may be placed in this class) of"
20263,SECTION VI.,"Helen. At least, I presume to regard some of them as fairly capable of"
20264,SECTION VI.,"being presented in another light, and I shall proceed at once to make"
20265,SECTION VI.,the attempt with Hector.

20271,SECTION VI.,predominates[974].’ Is there not a different view of the composition of

20275,SECTION VI.,
20276,SECTION VI.,"It is indeed eminently true, as in the same place he proceeds to"
20277,SECTION VI.,"observe, that in order to maintain what may be called the conventional"
20278,SECTION VI.,"balance, or stage-equality, which was necessary in order to give"
20279,SECTION VI.,"interest to his poem, Homer has magnified the prowess of Hector, in"
20280,SECTION VI.,"general terms, as of the highest transcendental order: but that in"
20281,SECTION VI.,actual achievement he is greatly surpassed by the leading Greek heroes.
20282,SECTION VI.,"Indeed, in many places of the Iliad it even seems questionable, whether"
20283,SECTION VI.,Hector is a hero at all.
20284,SECTION VI.,
20285,SECTION VI.,How successful Homer’s art has been in thus paying off the Trojan
20286,SECTION VI.,"champion with generalities, while he nevertheless reserved the true"
20287,SECTION VI.,"palm of military virtue to his own countrymen, we may, perhaps, best"
20288,SECTION VI.,judge from considering the effect which the picture has had upon the
20289,SECTION VI.,"poets of Italy, and upon European opinion at large, in more recent"
20290,SECTION VI.,"times. With the former, the name of Hector seems to be the prime type"
20291,SECTION VI.,of the heroic character. Thus Tasso celebrates--
20292,SECTION VI.,
20293,SECTION VI.,"‘Il buon Foresto, dell’ Italia Ettorre[975].’"
20294,SECTION VI.,
20295,SECTION VI.,[975] Ger. xvii. 69.
20296,SECTION VI.,
20297,SECTION VI.,"And further. Beyond the Alps, Orlando was the prime warrior or"
20298,SECTION VI.,"protagonist, as well as the finest character, of the mediæval romance,"
20299,SECTION VI.,"until it was modified by Ariosto, whose courtly object it was to"
20300,SECTION VI.,"elevate Ruggiero above him. But with the poets who followed Ariosto,"
20301,SECTION VI.,"Ruggiero seems to have been put by as an interpolation, and Orlando"
20302,SECTION VI.,to have resumed his paramount place. Now the character of Orlando
20303,SECTION VI.,"is plainly modelled upon the traditional idea of Hector, with the"
20304,SECTION VI.,Christian element attached to and pervading it. That Hector was thus
20305,SECTION VI.,"chosen, in preference to Achilles or any Greek hero, may be owing,"
20306,SECTION VI.,"among other causes, to these. First, that the Roman poets, Virgil"
20307,SECTION VI.,"especially, had taught Italians to look to Troy as the cradle of their"
20308,SECTION VI.,"grandeur. Secondly, that the character of Hector, from the large"
20309,SECTION VI.,"infusion into it of moral and of passive ingredients, was better fitted"
20310,SECTION VI.,"for coalescing with the Christian ideas. And thirdly, that, as the"
20311,SECTION VI.,part assigned to Italian patriotism in the middle ages was commonly
20312,SECTION VI.,"defensive, in this point also Hector offered a more appropriate model."
20313,SECTION VI.,"There is more, however, to observe; for it may be thought that, among"
20314,SECTION VI.,"the Trojans, Æneas would have offered a better groundwork for Italian"
20315,SECTION VI.,poets. But here we may remark how the genuine and masculine birth
20316,SECTION VI.,outlives the spurious. The natural Hector of Homer thrust aside the
20317,SECTION VI.,"pale and sickly automaton of the Æneid, even in Italy, its adopted"
20318,SECTION VI.,"country. The latter was so artificial and effete, that it would not"
20319,SECTION VI.,"even bear copying: the former had a foundation in truth, upon which the"
20320,SECTION VI.,"structure of exaggeration could be reared. Thus Hector became, after"
20321,SECTION VI.,"two thousand years, the central power of a new and splendid literature."
20322,SECTION VI.,
20323,SECTION VI.,"But when we turn back to the verse of Homer, and put together the"
20324,SECTION VI.,"evidence in the case piece by piece, surprise is excited by the"
20325,SECTION VI.,"contrast between the pretensions of Hector, having its basis in general"
20326,SECTION VI.,"descriptions and in the later tradition, on the one side, and on the"
20327,SECTION VI.,"other the actual performances, in the Iliad itself, of the Trojan"
20328,SECTION VI.,"champion. First, there is Achilles, his known superior; of whom, as"
20329,SECTION VI.,"a warrior, he comes within no measurable distance. But besides this,"
20330,SECTION VI.,"he suffers virtual defeat at the hands, once of Diomed, and twice"
20331,SECTION VI.,"of Ajax; glaringly as to the former, and not doubtfully as to the"
20332,SECTION VI.,"latter: for though the first battle is interrupted, and is taken for"
20333,SECTION VI.,"a drawn one, yet Ajax has had the best of it at every point, and,"
20334,SECTION VI.,while the Trojans are too happy upon the mere escape of his opponent
20335,SECTION VI.,"without bodily harm, Homer carries him to the tent of Agamemnon"
20336,SECTION VI.,rejoicing in his victory (κεχαρηότα νίκῃ[976]). It is yet more worthy
20337,SECTION VI.,"of note, that Hector is never permitted in actual fight to overcome"
20338,SECTION VI.,"any one considerable Greek. In the case of Patroclus, the Poet has"
20339,SECTION VI.,"even laid this fact much too barely open; for he makes Hector little,"
20340,SECTION VI.,"if anything, more than the mere executioner of death upon an unarmed"
20341,SECTION VI.,"man. Menelaus, who stood in what we may call the third rank of Grecian"
20342,SECTION VI.,"heroes, is indeed, on one occasion, withdrawn from conflict with him,"
20343,SECTION VI.,as being too greatly inferior to risk the fight; but the conflict for
20344,SECTION VI.,the body of Patroclus[977] is so contrived as to show even this prince
20345,SECTION VI.,"holding the field with success in despite of the Trojan chief; and,"
20346,SECTION VI.,"during the absence of Achilles and Patroclus from the contest, no less"
20347,SECTION VI.,than nine other Greek warriors offer themselves to meet him in single
20348,SECTION VI.,combat[978].

20355,SECTION VI.,
20356,SECTION VI.,"The greatest exploit of Hector, in the whole Iliad, is the bursting"
20357,SECTION VI.,open of the gates of the Greek rampart[979]. But if we compare this
20358,SECTION VI.,"with the feat of Sarpedon, who had just before opened a breach by"
20359,SECTION VI.,"tearing down the battlement[980], we must give a decided preference to"
20360,SECTION VI.,the Lycian hero; for he performs his achievement in the teeth of Ajax
20361,SECTION VI.,"and Teucer, who are on the spot; while there is not a single Greek"
20362,SECTION VI.,commander present when Hector breaks through the gates. The comparative
20363,SECTION VI.,"feebleness of Hector’s military character is, however, most pointedly"
20364,SECTION VI.,"shown in the Eleventh Book, when Jupiter determines to give effect"
20365,SECTION VI.,to the decision that honour shall be done to him[981]. In the first
20366,SECTION VI.,"place, he receives a friendly warning to keep out of the way as long"
20367,SECTION VI.,as Agamemnon remains on the field. He accordingly enters the battle
20368,SECTION VI.,only when Agamemnon has retired; but he is forthwith driven out of it
20369,SECTION VI.,"by Diomed[982]. When he again returns to it, the Greeks under Machaon"
20370,SECTION VI.,"baffle all his efforts, until that very secondary chieftain has been"
20371,SECTION VI.,disabled by an arrow from the bow of Paris[983]. And according to all
20372,SECTION VI.,"human appearances, the Trojans must have been defeated and shut up in"
20373,SECTION VI.,"the city by the Greeks even without Achilles, such was the superiority"
20374,SECTION VI.,"of Achæan arms, had not Homer called in the inferior agency of"
20375,SECTION VI.,stones and arrows to wound three of the four chief remaining Grecian
20376,SECTION VI.,"warriors, namely Diomed, Agamemnon, and Ulysses; besides Eurypylus and"

20399,SECTION VI.,~_Hector second-rate as a hero._~
20400,SECTION VI.,
20401,SECTION VI.,"The place of Hector, then, as a fighting hero, is certainly no more"
20402,SECTION VI.,"than second-rate; but so far, I venture to think, is Homer from having"
20403,SECTION VI.,almost equally weighted in his character the scales of good and evil
20404,SECTION VI.,"respectively, that, with the exception of his boastfulness, it is hard"
20405,SECTION VI.,"to fasten on him so much as a single fault. This boastfulness, and the"
20406,SECTION VI.,"disproportion between pretension and performance, is not altogether"
20407,SECTION VI.,"confined to him, but extends in some measure to the other Trojan"
20408,SECTION VI.,"warriors, except Sarpedon; for example, to Polydamas, Æneas, and Paris."
20409,SECTION VI.,"Some of the best Greeks too, particularly Diomed, are touched with"
20410,SECTION VI.,"it[985]. And perhaps, in our more elaborated and artificial condition"
20411,SECTION VI.,"of society, we are not quite fair judges how far this practice, which"
20412,SECTION VI.,may seem to stand in sharp contrast with the prevailing modesty of
20413,SECTION VI.,"the Homeric heroes, may have been with them not a substitute for,"
20414,SECTION VI.,"but a kind of embellishment and auxiliary to, their strength of soul"
20415,SECTION VI.,and hand. With us it is justly suspected of implying a tendency to
20416,SECTION VI.,fall short in performance: with them it may have appertained to that
20417,SECTION VI.,"straightforwardness in the expression of inward emotions, which made"
20418,SECTION VI.,them (for example) weep so freely whenever the chord of sorrow was
20419,SECTION VI.,touched within them.

20423,SECTION VI.,"So conspicuous is this quality, says Mure, that the name of the Trojan"
20424,SECTION VI.,chief is to this day synonymous in our own tongue with ‘bluster’ or
20425,SECTION VI.,‘swagger[986].’ But it is remarkable that the very same thing has
20426,SECTION VI.,"happened in the case of the word ‘rodomontade,’ which is derived from"
20427,SECTION VI.,"Rodomonte, the most powerful, next to Ruggiero, of all the heroes of"
20428,SECTION VI.,"the Furioso. This circumstance seems to make probable, what, without"
20429,SECTION VI.,"it, would be only possible, namely, that we misconstrue the phrases;"
20430,SECTION VI.,"and that, according to the true meaning, a rodomontader is a man"
20431,SECTION VI.,passing himself off for a Rodomonte: and one who hectors is a man

20436,SECTION VI.,"Another very high authority, Lord Grenville, intimately acquainted with"
20437,SECTION VI.,"the poems of Homer, supplies a marked example of the blinding force"
20438,SECTION VI.,"of literary traditions. For in his ‘Nugæ Metricæ[987],’ he says: ‘A"
20439,SECTION VI.,hectoring fellow is ... strangely distorted in its use to express a
20440,SECTION VI.,meaning almost the opposite of its original.’ And he adds in a note:

20446,SECTION VI.,
20447,SECTION VI.,"The disposition of the Trojan chief to brag is, however, the more"
20448,SECTION VI.,"offensive, because it vents itself so much in the first person"
20449,SECTION VI.,singular; because in the case of Patroclus it seems to be associated
20450,SECTION VI.,with an act at least unmanly; and because upon many occasions Hector
20451,SECTION VI.,shows even more than a prudential regard to his personal safety.
20452,SECTION VI.,
20453,SECTION VI.,"What is more strange is, that his ordinary strain of boasting is"
20454,SECTION VI.,chequered with passages of more genuine modesty and humility than are
20455,SECTION VI.,to be found in the speech of any other chieftain on either side. As for
20456,SECTION VI.,"example, when he acknowledges his marked inferiority to Achilles;"

20470,SECTION VI.,
20471,SECTION VI.,Homer is of all poets the most free from any thing that can be called
20472,SECTION VI.,"trick; but perhaps it may be that the same necessity of his position,"
20473,SECTION VI.,"which obliged him to magnify Trojan prowess in words, while it falls so"
20474,SECTION VI.,"short in deeds, has found its way from the narrative into the dramatic"
20475,SECTION VI.,"part of the poem. If so, then in Hector’s boasts we may recognise Homer"
20476,SECTION VI.,working out his own general purpose rather than conforming with perfect
20477,SECTION VI.,"fidelity to tradition, or finishing an ideally perfect portrait with"
20478,SECTION VI.,"the power and exactitude, which he has applied to his greater Grecian"
20479,SECTION VI.,"heroes. Yet, be the cause what it may that has led Homer to exhibit in"
20480,SECTION VI.,"Hector the disagreeable gift of a bragging disposition, Mure appears to"
20481,SECTION VI.,show less than his usual precision when he ascribes to Hector in one
20482,SECTION VI.,"place a partial[990], and in another a total, indifference to the moral"
20483,SECTION VI.,guilt of his brother Paris.

20486,SECTION VI.,
20487,SECTION VI.,"Whatever may be the reason, the fact undoubtedly is, that neither on"
20488,SECTION VI.,"the Trojan, nor even on the Greek side, do we find displayed such a"
20489,SECTION VI.,sense of the shameful crime of Paris as we might have anticipated
20490,SECTION VI.,from a first view of the manners and feelings of the age. As far as
20491,SECTION VI.,"regards the Poet himself, we may read his indignant sense of it in"
20492,SECTION VI.,"the portraiture he has been careful to give of Paris himself, and of"
20493,SECTION VI.,"his ill fame among his countrymen; but, undoubtedly, although his act"
20494,SECTION VI.,"is everywhere described as the cause of war, it is nowhere spoken of,"
20495,SECTION VI.,"among those who had suffered by it, with the passion and indignation"
20496,SECTION VI.,"which we might suppose it would have aroused. Of all the Greeks,"
20497,SECTION VI.,only Menelaus alludes to it as an act of guilt. Various causes may
20498,SECTION VI.,be assigned for this with more or less confidence. A probable one
20499,SECTION VI.,"is, as we have seen[991], that the act partook of the character of"
20500,SECTION VI.,"an abduction or rape, in which enterprise and force gild or hide the"
20501,SECTION VI.,"ugly features of crime. An unpopular form of criminality might then,"
20502,SECTION VI.,"as now, come off the more easily from being covered by another which"
20503,SECTION VI.,"is popular. It also without doubt appears, that another reason may be"
20504,SECTION VI.,"the length of time which, in any view of the case, must have elapsed"
20505,SECTION VI.,since the act had taken place. But perhaps the solution of the question
20506,SECTION VI.,"is to be mainly found in this consideration, common to modern with"
20507,SECTION VI.,"ancient times, that the causes of war are apt to be swallowed up in"
20508,SECTION VI.,"its circumstances. In entering upon the arbitrement of the sword, men"
20509,SECTION VI.,"do not choose a fixed position, but they embark upon a stream, always"
20510,SECTION VI.,powerful and often ungovernable. When once the armament was on the
20511,SECTION VI.,"shores of the Hellespont, there would be on both sides the motive of"
20512,SECTION VI.,"military honour, and, besides this, with the Trojans, the defence of"
20513,SECTION VI.,"their families and homes, with the Greeks the hope of plunder and of"
20514,SECTION VI.,"license. Hence, even after the Greeks are weakened and discouraged by"
20515,SECTION VI.,"the secession of Achilles, it is not from them, but from the Trojans,"
20516,SECTION VI.,that a proposal proceeds for deciding the case of Helen by single
20517,SECTION VI.,"combat. Hence, upon the shameful escape of Paris from fulfilling this"
20518,SECTION VI.,"engagement, after his defeat by Menelaus, we find little expression of"
20519,SECTION VI.,"indignation on one side, and no confession of wrong on the other. But"
20520,SECTION VI.,the criticism of Mure seems to amount to this; that it was a capital
20521,SECTION VI.,"fault on the part of Hector, not to have his mind constantly full of a"
20522,SECTION VI.,"question, which was rarely thought of at all by any one on either side,"
20523,SECTION VI.,"except Paris and Menelaus, the persons most directly interested."
20524,SECTION VI.,
20525,SECTION VI.,"[991] See sup. Ilios, pp. 196-205."
20526,SECTION VI.,
20527,SECTION VI.,"It is plain, however, that Homer has represented Hector as keenly"
20528,SECTION VI.,"feeling and resenting, not only his brother’s cowardice, but his"
20529,SECTION VI.,"sensuality. Twice does he address him as mad with lust, and as a"
20530,SECTION VI.,"deceiver of women[992]: out of his five speeches addressed to Paris,"
20531,SECTION VI.,only one is not reproachful; and in the only one which extends beyond
20532,SECTION VI.,a few lines he barbs his reproaches on the score of cowardice by fully
20533,SECTION VI.,"setting forth his guilt, both morally and as towards his country, in"
20534,SECTION VI.,"that, being a coward, he was also a ravisher[993]. The charge, however,"
20535,SECTION VI.,also takes a more specific form. We see that Hector was greatly
20536,SECTION VI.,"delighted, ἐχάρη μέγα when his rebuke[994] had stirred up Paris to"
20537,SECTION VI.,offer to stake the whole issue on a single combat with Menelaus. But
20538,SECTION VI.,"it is said, why, when the battle had been lost, did not Hector enforce"
20539,SECTION VI.,the terms of the bargain? The answer seems to be this. We stand here
20540,SECTION VI.,"at a juncture in the poem, where its theurgy supersedes its human"
20541,SECTION VI.,"mechanism. It is presumable that this very thing was about to be done,"
20542,SECTION VI.,when the order of events was interrupted by the counsel of the gods.
20543,SECTION VI.,Agamemnon had at the close of the Third Book in due course demanded
20544,SECTION VI.,Helen. Jupiter immediately apprehended the consequences; he saw that if
20545,SECTION VI.,"faith were kept, Achilles would neither be avenged nor glorified; and"
20546,SECTION VI.,"he accordingly invited the assembly on Olympus to determine, whether"
20547,SECTION VI.,Helen should be rendered back or not. When this had been settled in
20548,SECTION VI.,"the negative, the question was how to prevent it; and it was done, on"
20549,SECTION VI.,"the suggestion of Juno, by causing Pandarus to renew the war without"
20550,SECTION VI.,the privity of Hector. This shows pretty clearly that the restoration
20551,SECTION VI.,"of Helen was about to take place, had not the gods interfered; and"
20552,SECTION VI.,"therefore amply suffices to relieve Hector from reproach, who, it may"
20553,SECTION VI.,"be observed, takes no part until, when the armies have been long in"
20554,SECTION VI.,"conflict, he has been stung by the reproaches of Sarpedon (v. 493)."
20555,SECTION VI.,"If censure be due to the arrangement, it must be lodged against the"
20556,SECTION VI.,"Poet, and not against one of his personages, who simply does not appear"
20557,SECTION VI.,because there is no part for him to play.

20566,SECTION VI.,
20567,SECTION VI.,Let us now proceed to a somewhat more general view of the character of
20568,SECTION VI.,Hector.
20569,SECTION VI.,
20570,SECTION VI.,"He occupies in the Homeric tradition a place altogether peculiar,"
20571,SECTION VI.,"as, at the time of the poem, the sole eminently warlike member of an"
20572,SECTION VI.,unwarlike family; as the general of a divided and incongruous army; and
20573,SECTION VI.,"as singly responsible in chief for the safety of his country, while he"
20574,SECTION VI.,has not been invested with the dignity and power of king. As to the
20575,SECTION VI.,"first of these points, we have the direct testimony of Homer:"
20576,SECTION VI.,
20577,SECTION VI.,οἶος γὰρ ἐρύετο Ἴλιον Ἕκτωρ[995].
20578,SECTION VI.,
20579,SECTION VI.,[995] Il. vi. 403.
20580,SECTION VI.,
20581,SECTION VI.,"Of his brothers, Deiphobus alone is represented as in any degree"
20582,SECTION VI.,"deserving or sharing his confidence. Of his relatives, Polydamas"
20583,SECTION VI.,"appears to have been a rival in the council, Æneas in the succession to"
20584,SECTION VI.,political supremacy: and these were the two most considerable persons
20585,SECTION VI.,"of the class. It has, I conceive, been shown to be probable, that"
20586,SECTION VI.,Paris was his senior[996]; and that he held his place in Troy by merit
20587,SECTION VI.,against age. His uneasy relations with his allies might be inferred
20588,SECTION VI.,"from their constituting the great bulk of his force, even were they"
20589,SECTION VI.,"not more distinctly betokened by the reproach of Sarpedon, and by the"
20590,SECTION VI.,speech in which he himself enters on the subject. Together with his
20591,SECTION VI.,"power over the army, he had the virtual charge of the safety of the"
20592,SECTION VI.,"state, and we see signs of his influence there; but yet he did not"
20593,SECTION VI.,"direct the policy of Troy: for the only important measure, which is"
20594,SECTION VI.,"recorded as having been taken by the Trojans, namely the rejection of"
20595,SECTION VI.,"the proposals of Antenor to give back Helen to the Greeks, was taken in"
20596,SECTION VI.,"his absence and without his knowledge. Thus we see in Hector’s case,"
20597,SECTION VI.,"abundantly accumulated, the elements of a false position. And, in a"
20598,SECTION VI.,"word, in order to estimate his character aright, we must keep in full"
20599,SECTION VI.,"view that inferiority of the Trojans, subjects not less than princes,"
20600,SECTION VI.,"as respects political genius and organization, to which the Iliad, when"
20601,SECTION VI.,"carefully examined, bears ample testimony."
20602,SECTION VI.,
20603,SECTION VI.,"[996] Ilios, pp. 219-23."
20604,SECTION VI.,
20605,SECTION VI.,"Under the weight of public charge, as Agamemnon in the Greek camp, so,"
20606,SECTION VI.,"and yet more, Hector on the Trojan side, appears to reel; so, and yet"
20607,SECTION VI.,"more; for, in Hector’s case, political power is crippled by his not"
20608,SECTION VI.,"being in actual possession of the supreme station, while responsibility"
20609,SECTION VI.,"is edged and enhanced by his being not only the head to devise, but"
20610,SECTION VI.,"also the right hand to execute. In neither of the two, however, do we"
20611,SECTION VI.,"find strong will, definiteness, and constancy of purpose, or unfailing"
20612,SECTION VI.,courage. But Agamemnon has the advantage of both wiser counsels around
20613,SECTION VI.,"him, and stronger arms than his own near his side. Hector has little"
20614,SECTION VI.,aid. Sarpedon alone of the Trojan commanders (for Æneas really does
20615,SECTION VI.,nothing) can be called a warrior of note; and his inferiority to
20616,SECTION VI.,"Patroclus, notwithstanding his thorough gallantry, is decorated rather"
20617,SECTION VI.,than hidden by the stage machinery of divine consultations on the
20618,SECTION VI.,subject of his death. But as Sarpedon in the field plays a part much
20619,SECTION VI.,"inferior to the corresponding one of Diomed or Ajax, so Polydamas,"
20620,SECTION VI.,"the Nestor of the Trojans, is not equal to his kindly and genial"
20621,SECTION VI.,counterpart. Four times he gives his counsel in the field. Twice he
20622,SECTION VI.,"prefaces it with personal imputations (xii. 211, and xiii. 726); and"
20623,SECTION VI.,"when, in the Twelfth Book (211), he recommends the abandonment of the"
20624,SECTION VI.,"assault on the ships in deference to an omen, feeling and judgment are"
20625,SECTION VI.,"alike on the side of Hector’s reply, who overturns his augury by the"
20626,SECTION VI.,"known (though, as they proved, deceitful) counsels of Jupiter, and"
20627,SECTION VI.,emphatically pleads against doubtful signs the indubitable dictates of
20628,SECTION VI.,patriotism.
20629,SECTION VI.,
20630,SECTION VI.,~_His bright side in the affections._~
20631,SECTION VI.,
20632,SECTION VI.,"The prophetic gift, for whatever reason, is assigned pretty largely"
20633,SECTION VI.,"by Homer to the Trojans. Without entering into the case of Cassandra,"
20634,SECTION VI.,"it attaches to Helenus, and also (xii. 238) apparently to Polydamas,"
20635,SECTION VI.,who undertakes to interpret a sign. Hector himself had the weight of
20636,SECTION VI.,"prescience on his breast, for he tells Andromache[997] that he well"
20637,SECTION VI.,"knows the day of ruin is at hand; and, when he is at the point of"
20638,SECTION VI.,"death, he prognosticates the coming fate of Achilles. The concentrated"
20639,SECTION VI.,strain of his duties and his previsions is too much for the strength
20640,SECTION VI.,"of a character which, from the intellectual or dramatic point of view,"
20641,SECTION VI.,"is impulsive, fluctuating, and unequal, and which must therefore"
20642,SECTION VI.,undoubtedly be set down as so far secondary. But when we pass from
20643,SECTION VI.,"intellect to moral tone, from διάνοια to ἦθος, we certainly find"
20644,SECTION VI.,"in Hector one among the most touching, the most human, of all the"
20645,SECTION VI.,delineations of masculine character in the Iliad. In him alone has
20646,SECTION VI.,"Homer presented to us that most commanding and most moving combination,"
20647,SECTION VI.,of a woman’s gentleness and deep affection with warlike and heroic
20648,SECTION VI.,strength. If the hand of Hector was far weaker than that of the son
20649,SECTION VI.,"of Peleus, the tempestuous griefs of Achilles do not open to us a"
20650,SECTION VI.,character nearly so attractive as the depth of the gentle affections
20651,SECTION VI.,"of Hector, and the mildness warmed into such brilliancy by his martial"
20652,SECTION VI.,fame. ‘Thy love to me was wonderful; passing the love of women[998].’
20653,SECTION VI.,The constancy and tenacity of the attachments of Ulysses come out in
20654,SECTION VI.,"his relations to Penelope and Telemachus: but, dwelling harmoniously"
20655,SECTION VI.,"in a character of far broader scope and more varied sensibilities, the"
20656,SECTION VI.,peculiar element of a tenderness matching that of woman is the only one
20657,SECTION VI.,they do not contain. Hector is neither a warrior nor a statesman after
20658,SECTION VI.,"the primary, that is the Achæan, type: but for a model of intensity and"
20659,SECTION VI.,"softness in the love of a father and a husband, it is to him that we"
20660,SECTION VI.,"must repair, in the incomparable scene by the Scæan gate; incomparable,"
20661,SECTION VI.,"unless we may compare it with that other scene, so near at hand, where"
20662,SECTION VI.,"the sight of young Polydorus slain, piercing him to the heart, raised"
20663,SECTION VI.,him in his last hour to the heights of heroism; and where the interest
20664,SECTION VI.,"and sympathy, that he has attracted all along, are absorbed into"
20665,SECTION VI.,"admiration of the real sublimity of that closing hour, when he resolved"
20666,SECTION VI.,to be for ever famous at least in his too certain death.

20671,SECTION VI.,
20672,SECTION VI.,Probably a main reason why Hector has become the groundwork of the
20673,SECTION VI.,"modern Orlando is, that no one of the Homeric heroes exhibits a"
20674,SECTION VI.,combination of qualities supplying so appropriate a basis for the
20675,SECTION VI.,character of a Christian hero; a tone so sensibly approximating to
20676,SECTION VI.,that of the gospel. Partly because of those acts of piety towards the
20677,SECTION VI.,"Immortals, which can hardly receive in the case of Hector any but a"
20678,SECTION VI.,"favourable construction, and which drew down the all but unanimous"
20679,SECTION VI.,"compassion of the Olympian assembly on his remains; but partly also,"
20680,SECTION VI.,"and yet more, in that mild, just, and tender estimate of character,"
20681,SECTION VI.,which not only secured his constant gentleness of demeanour towards
20682,SECTION VI.,"Helen, but made him her protector against the acrimony of others, and"
20683,SECTION VI.,"rendered him considerate and kind even to Paris[999], so soon as he saw"
20684,SECTION VI.,him disposed at length to be personally active in the mortal struggle
20685,SECTION VI.,"he had brought upon his country. There is, perhaps, no virtue more"
20686,SECTION VI.,"especially Christian, than the temper which thus equitably and gently"
20687,SECTION VI.,"makes allowances for human weakness, particularly if it be weakness by"
20688,SECTION VI.,the effects of which we ourselves have suffered.
20689,SECTION VI.,
20690,SECTION VI.,[999] Il. vi. 521.
20691,SECTION VI.,
20692,SECTION VI.,"The employment, however, of Hector for the purposes of Christian poetry"
20693,SECTION VI.,has certainly had the effect of perverting for us the true Homeric
20694,SECTION VI.,"tradition. But, in order to understand this, we must throw aside the"
20695,SECTION VI.,"Hector of our proverbs or our plays, travel back to the Iliad, and set"
20696,SECTION VI.,out anew from the starting-point of its great author. We must there
20697,SECTION VI.,be content to take him not as a pure effort of imagination aimed at
20698,SECTION VI.,"the production of an ideal man, but as a part of the poem of Homer,"
20699,SECTION VI.,"subordinated like every other part of it to its main purpose, as well"
20700,SECTION VI.,as to the general laws of historical consistency. In modelling the
20701,SECTION VI.,"several heroes, he made the exigencies of his Hector yield to the"
20702,SECTION VI.,"exigencies of his Achilles, who could have no real competitor. Nor,"
20703,SECTION VI.,with the fine characteristic sense he has everywhere shown of the
20704,SECTION VI.,"national differences between Greek and Trojan, could he build up his"
20705,SECTION VI.,"Hector on the same foundations with his Greek heroes, or give him that"
20706,SECTION VI.,strength and tenacity of tissue which belongs to the European and
20707,SECTION VI.,Achæan character. He could not equip him with either the dauntless
20708,SECTION VI.,"chivalry in battle, or the profound unswerving sagacity in council,"
20709,SECTION VI.,"which were reserved for the kings of his own race, and for those most"
20710,SECTION VI.,nearly allied to them. He has imparted to the character of the chief
20711,SECTION VI.,"Trojan hero, no less than to that of the Trojan people at large, a"
20712,SECTION VI.,"decided Asiatic tinge, which modifies their community of colour with"
20713,SECTION VI.,"the properly European races. In such characters, instinct and sentiment"
20714,SECTION VI.,"take oftentimes the place of inquiry and reflection, and impulse"
20715,SECTION VI.,"does the work of conviction: the ideas of right, order, consistency,"
20716,SECTION VI.,"moral dignity and self-respect, are less clearly, less symmetrically,"
20717,SECTION VI.,"conceived. Though in particular cases, such as that of Hector, the"
20718,SECTION VI.,deficiency may be made up by a liberal and full development of the most
20719,SECTION VI.,"affectionate emotions, we feel, in comparing it with the Greeks, that"
20720,SECTION VI.,"we are dealing with a more contracted type of manhood: as if morally,"
20721,SECTION VI.,"no less than locally, we had gone back with Homer one full stage"
20722,SECTION VI.,"nearer to the cradle of our race, and had arrested and fixed the human"
20723,SECTION VI.,character at the very point where it is neither child nor man.
20724,SECTION VI.,
20725,SECTION VI.,~_Inequality of his character._~
20726,SECTION VI.,
20727,SECTION VI.,"The character of Hector, as it has been here interpreted, does not give"
20728,SECTION VI.,"that satisfaction to the mind, which thorough clearness and oneness"
20729,SECTION VI.,would impart. His intellectual qualities and his affections are not
20730,SECTION VI.,on the same scale; his martial character jars even with itself. Yet
20731,SECTION VI.,perhaps in these very circumstances we may upon consideration find
20732,SECTION VI.,"but fresh reason to admire the skill of Homer, and that rarely erring"
20733,SECTION VI.,instinct which forbade him to forget his whole in running after his
20734,SECTION VI.,details.
20735,SECTION VI.,
20736,SECTION VI.,His first object seems to have been to give the fullest and boldest
20737,SECTION VI.,"prominence to the colossal shape, moral as well as physical, of"
20738,SECTION VI.,"Achilles, and therefore to tone down whatever could diminish its"
20739,SECTION VI.,effect. And here the point of danger evidently lay in Agamemnon;
20740,SECTION VI.,the chief of the army was too likely to be the chief of the poem.
20741,SECTION VI.,"Accordingly he has broken the unity of that character, and has"
20742,SECTION VI.,chequered it with weakness in various forms. But this was not all: he
20743,SECTION VI.,"had to keep the Greeks before the Trojans, as well as Achilles before"
20744,SECTION VI.,"the Greeks; not only that he might consult his popularity, but that he"
20745,SECTION VI.,"might indulge the genial vein of his poesy, and follow the impulses"
20746,SECTION VI.,"of his patriotism, in maintaining high above all question their"
20747,SECTION VI.,"intellectual and martial superiority. Had this, however, been all,"
20748,SECTION VI.,his task would have been easy; he would then have had only to depress
20749,SECTION VI.,their opponents in all the properties that attract admiration. But if
20750,SECTION VI.,"he had simply done this, if he had cut off the interest and sympathies"
20751,SECTION VI.,"of his readers from the Trojans by general disparagement, he would have"
20752,SECTION VI.,deprived Greek valour of its choicest crown. It is a noble necessity of
20753,SECTION VI.,"war that, even in the interest of countrymen, we cannot do injustice to"
20754,SECTION VI.,"adversaries, without feeling the offence recoil on our own heads."
20755,SECTION VI.,
20756,SECTION VI.,Thus it was impossible for Homer to make his Trojan hero at once great
20757,SECTION VI.,"and consistent; and if he has made Hector unequal, it was to avoid"
20758,SECTION VI.,"making him mean. By chequering his martial daring with boastfulness,"
20759,SECTION VI.,"and with occasional weakness of purpose, he has effectually provided"
20760,SECTION VI.,"against any interference, from this quarter, to the prejudice of those"
20761,SECTION VI.,chieftains whose praises he was to sing in the courts and throngs of
20762,SECTION VI.,Greece. Thus he has left the field quite clear for expatiating on their
20763,SECTION VI.,"military virtues; and if, for sufficient reasons, he has departed from"
20764,SECTION VI.,"his rule in the case of Agamemnon, who receives his compensation in"
20765,SECTION VI.,"superiority of rank and power, all his other Greek characters, bearing"
20766,SECTION VI.,"forward parts in the poem, are constructed in faultless conformity to"
20767,SECTION VI.,"the idea, or modification of an idea, which he had selected for the"
20768,SECTION VI.,"basis of each. There is not a flaw in the picture of Achilles, Diomed,"
20769,SECTION VI.,"Ajax, Nestor, Menelaus, or Ulysses. Not that all these are of a type"
20770,SECTION VI.,"equally elevated, or alike wonderful; but that there is no one thing"
20771,SECTION VI.,"in any of them which does not manifestly conform to its type, and no"
20772,SECTION VI.,one thing consequently which jars with any other. Having thus given to
20773,SECTION VI.,his countrymen a clear and marked ascendancy in what then at least were
20774,SECTION VI.,"the only great and governing elements of human society, the strong"
20775,SECTION VI.,"mind, and the strong hand, he does his best for the Trojans with what"
20776,SECTION VI.,"remained, that is to say, with the softer affections of domestic life,"
20777,SECTION VI.,adding only so much of the martial element as was needful to make them
20778,SECTION VI.,"no discreditable adversaries for his countrymen. Thus, consistently"
20779,SECTION VI.,"with all his poetic objects, he has been enabled to present us, to say"
20780,SECTION VI.,"nothing of the highly respectable character of Hecuba, with the three"
20781,SECTION VI.,"unsurpassed pictures of Priam, of Andromache, and perhaps even most, of"
20782,SECTION VI.,Hector.

20789,SECTION VI.,The character of Argeian Helen occupies a large place in Grecian

20800,SECTION VI.,
20801,SECTION VI.,"Was she a vicious woman and a seductress, or was she more nearly a"
20802,SECTION VI.,victim and a penitent? Do the laws of poetical verisimilitude and
20803,SECTION VI.,"beauty, as they were understood by Homer, allow us to suppose that he"
20804,SECTION VI.,"intended to represent his countrymen, of whom he has presented to us"
20805,SECTION VI.,"so lofty a conception, as agitating the world, forsaking home, pouring"
20806,SECTION VI.,"forth their blood, and throwing their country into certain confusion,"
20807,SECTION VI.,for the sake of a vile and worthless character? Certainly there were
20808,SECTION VI.,"periods, when in the Greek mind the worship of beauty was so thoroughly"
20809,SECTION VI.,"dissociated from all which beauty ought to typify, that an Iliad so"
20810,SECTION VI.,constructed might have been approved. But these were periods long after
20811,SECTION VI.,Homer’s flesh had mouldered in the grave.
20812,SECTION VI.,
20813,SECTION VI.,The present inquiry has nothing to do with the opinion that Helen
20814,SECTION VI.,"was, or that she was not, an historical personage. For my own part, I"
20815,SECTION VI.,know of no reason except discrepancies of mere traditional chronology
20816,SECTION VI.,for disbelieving her existence. These seem to arise entirely from
20817,SECTION VI.,the practice of putting on a par with Homer tales of very inferior
20818,SECTION VI.,"authority to his. But even apart from this, considering what, under"
20819,SECTION VI.,"ordinary circumstances, the chronology of pre-historic times is likely"
20820,SECTION VI.,"to be, and how many more chances there are for the preservation of"
20821,SECTION VI.,"great events in outline, than for a careful adjustment of their"
20822,SECTION VI.,"relative times, I cannot but think that difficulties arising from"
20823,SECTION VI.,"other legends as to Helen, and bearing simply upon time, form a very"
20824,SECTION VI.,insufficient reason for the wholesale rejection of belief in her
20825,SECTION VI.,"existence. Even if, however, she never existed at all, it still is not"
20826,SECTION VI.,"one whit the less reasonably to be presumed, that Homer in fictions"
20827,SECTION VI.,"concerning her would be governed here and elsewhere by all the laws,"
20828,SECTION VI.,"including the moral laws, of his art."
20829,SECTION VI.,
20830,SECTION VI.,"Neither is it now the question, whether Helen was the model of an"
20831,SECTION VI.,"heroic character. That is probably inconsistent, for the earliest"
20832,SECTION VI.,"times of Greece, with her adulterous relation to Paris and afterwards"
20833,SECTION VI.,to Deiphobus. But there is a vast space between a faultless and a
20834,SECTION VI.,"worthless woman. The idea of Helen represented by the later tradition,"
20835,SECTION VI.,"from the Greek tragedians downwards, is strictly the latter idea: and"
20836,SECTION VI.,"this representation has naturally occupied the popular mind, which is"
20837,SECTION VI.,deprived of the power of access to the remote Homeric picture. Now
20838,SECTION VI.,"it seems to be plain that, if this representation be substantially"
20839,SECTION VI.,"true, it is a great reproach to the bard of the Iliad as a bard, and"
20840,SECTION VI.,"stamps him as one, who has done his best to poison morality at its"
20841,SECTION VI.,"fountain-head. For there can be no question, that he has made his Helen"
20842,SECTION VI.,"highly attractive, and that he intends her to possess our sympathies."
20843,SECTION VI.,"Is it then true, or is it false? Let us proceed to examine the evidence."
20844,SECTION VI.,
20845,SECTION VI.,"In the Iliad we meet more than once with the line,"

20850,SECTION VI.,
20851,SECTION VI.,"and expositors, in order to avoid ascribing to Helen any personal"
20852,SECTION VI.,"wrongs, or the representation of her as rather a sufferer than an"
20853,SECTION VI.,"offender, have resorted to a forced construction of the passage, and"
20854,SECTION VI.,"have interpreted the words as referring to the expedition undertaken,"
20855,SECTION VI.,"and the griefs suffered, _on account of_ Helen[1002]."
20856,SECTION VI.,
20857,SECTION VI.,"[1002] See Heyne on Il. ii. 356. G. C. Crusius (Hanover. 1845, on do.)"
20858,SECTION VI.,Chapman translates in the same sense; but Voss refers the outsetting
20859,SECTION VI.,and the groans to Helen herself; so too the Scholiasts.
20860,SECTION VI.,
20861,SECTION VI.,~_Homer’s intention with respect to it._~
20862,SECTION VI.,
20863,SECTION VI.,"Unless this forced construction be the one intended by Homer, the"
20864,SECTION VI.,popular conception of her must at once explode. According to the direct
20865,SECTION VI.,"and natural construction, the Greeks made war to avenge the wrong she"
20866,SECTION VI.,"had suffered, and the groans which that wrong had drawn from her."
20867,SECTION VI.,And it is to be observed that this line[1003] is put into the mouth
20868,SECTION VI.,"of Menelaus, whom it is very natural to represent as most eager to"
20869,SECTION VI.,"avenge the wrongs of his wife, but somewhat far-fetched to represent"
20870,SECTION VI.,as thinking of revenge for the trouble of the expedition he had so
20871,SECTION VI.,"keenly promoted. The line, in fact, unless justifiably strained by"
20872,SECTION VI.,"these expositors, is conclusive in support of the belief that the only"
20873,SECTION VI.,evil which can justly be imputed to the Homeric Helen simply amounts
20874,SECTION VI.,"to this, that she was not a woman of perfect virtue backed by absolute"
20875,SECTION VI.,and indomitable heroism. Pope has rather rudely approximated towards
20876,SECTION VI.,"rectifying the prevalent impression in a note[1004], where he observes"
20877,SECTION VI.,that in all she says of herself ‘there is scarce a word that is not big
20878,SECTION VI.,with repentance and good nature.’

20883,SECTION VI.,
20884,SECTION VI.,"Before examining the direct evidence with respect to the Homeric Helen,"
20885,SECTION VI.,let us advert to some which is indirect. And in the first place it may
20886,SECTION VI.,"be observed, that Menelaus never expresses the slightest resentment"
20887,SECTION VI.,"against her, or appears to have considered her as having in any manner"
20888,SECTION VI.,"injured him. Next, Priam, whose character is evidently intended to"
20889,SECTION VI.,"attract a good deal of our sympathy and respect, treated her as a"
20890,SECTION VI.,daughter:

20894,SECTION VI.,[1005] Il. xxiv. 770.
20895,SECTION VI.,
20896,SECTION VI.,Nor was this a mere figure; for in the Third Book he addresses her as
20897,SECTION VI.,"φίλον τέκος[1006], and makes her sit down by his side. In conformity"
20898,SECTION VI.,"with this picture, her sister-in-law Laodice addresses her as νύμφα"
20899,SECTION VI.,φίλη[1007]. Priam goes on to acquit her of all responsibility in his
20900,SECTION VI.,eyes with regard to the war:

20908,SECTION VI.,"And that this was not meant to cover Paris, we may learn from the many"
20909,SECTION VI.,"passages, which show us how the general sentiment of Troy detested him."
20910,SECTION VI.,"Had Helen been of the character which is commonly imputed to her, such"
20911,SECTION VI.,an absolution as this would probably not have been ascribed to Priam;
20912,SECTION VI.,while most certainly it would not have been recorded to the honour of
20913,SECTION VI.,"Hector that he always restrained those, who were disposed to taunt her"
20914,SECTION VI.,on account of the woes she had brought upon Troy[1008].
20915,SECTION VI.,
20916,SECTION VI.,[1008] Il. xxiv. 768-72.
20917,SECTION VI.,
20918,SECTION VI.,She describes herself indeed as the object of general horror in Troy
20919,SECTION VI.,(πάντες δέ με πεφρίκασιν[1009]). But these words do no more than
20920,SECTION VI.,"state the impression, at a moment of agony, on her own humbled and"
20921,SECTION VI.,"self-mistrusting mind: while, even had they given a faithful picture of"
20922,SECTION VI.,"the manner in which she was regarded by the Trojans, still they might"
20923,SECTION VI.,well be explained with reference to the woes of which she had been at
20924,SECTION VI.,"least the occasion, and the sentiment they describe might as naturally"
20925,SECTION VI.,"have been felt, even had she been the lawfully obtained wife of Paris."
20926,SECTION VI.,
20927,SECTION VI.,[1009] Ibid. 775.
20928,SECTION VI.,
20929,SECTION VI.,"There are two other passages, which may seem at first sight to betoken"
20930,SECTION VI.,a state of mind adverse to her among the Greeks. But the explanation
20931,SECTION VI.,"of them is simply this, that the cause of woe is naturally enough"
20932,SECTION VI.,"denounced on account of the misfortunes it has entailed, irrespective"
20933,SECTION VI.,of the question whether or in what degree it may be a guilty
20934,SECTION VI.,"cause[1010]. Thus Achilles calls Helen ῥιγεδάνη, ‘that horrible Helen;’"
20935,SECTION VI.,but it is only when her abduction has produced to him the bitter and
20936,SECTION VI.,harrowing affliction of the death of Patroclus. When he mentions her
20937,SECTION VI.,"in the magnificent speech of the Ninth Book to the envoys, she is"
20938,SECTION VI.,"Ἑλένη ἠΰκομος, ‘the fair-haired Helen.’ Now, if she had been vile, the"
20939,SECTION VI.,course of his argument must have constrained him then to state it. For
20940,SECTION VI.,"he was reasoning thus: May I not resent the loss of Briseis, who was"
20941,SECTION VI.,"dear to me (θυμαρής[1011]), when the sons of Atreus have made their"
20942,SECTION VI.,"loss of Helen the cause of the war? Had Helen been worthless, it would"
20943,SECTION VI.,have added greatly to the stringency of his argument to have drawn the
20944,SECTION VI.,"contrast in that particular, between the woman whom Agamemnon had taken"
20945,SECTION VI.,"away, and the woman that he was seeking, by means of the convulsive"
20946,SECTION VI.,"struggle of a nation, to recover."

20952,SECTION VI.,"The other passage is in Od. xxiii., where Penelope, after the"
20953,SECTION VI.,"recognition of her husband, speaks of Helen in these words:--"

20958,SECTION VI.,
20959,SECTION VI.,"But even in this only passage where the act of Helen is so described,"
20960,SECTION VI.,"several points are to be observed. First, it is referred to a"
20961,SECTION VI.,"preternatural influence, which is not the manner of this Poet in cases"
20962,SECTION VI.,"at least of deep and deliberate crime; secondly, no epithet of infamy"
20963,SECTION VI.,"is applied to her; thirdly, we must observe the drift of the speaker."
20964,SECTION VI.,"Penelope is excusing herself to Ulysses, for her own extreme caution"
20965,SECTION VI.,and reserve in admitting his identity. Therefore she is naturally led
20966,SECTION VI.,to enhance the dreadful nature of the occurrence where a wife gives
20967,SECTION VI.,"herself over into the power of any man, other than one known to be"
20968,SECTION VI.,"her husband; and this, whether the act be voluntary or involuntary."
20969,SECTION VI.,"Accordingly she refers to the act of Helen rather than to the agent,"

21001,SECTION VI.,
21002,SECTION VI.,No one of these appellations carries the smallest taint or censure.
21003,SECTION VI.,The epithet δῖα in all probability applies to her personal beauty and
21004,SECTION VI.,"majesty, as we find it used of Paris and of Clytemnestra. It would"
21005,SECTION VI.,"appear, however, that the use of the term Argive or Argeian, in many"
21006,SECTION VI.,"passages where it is not required for mere description, has a special"
21007,SECTION VI.,force. For Homer never exhibits that which is simply Greek in any other
21008,SECTION VI.,"than an honourable light; and in calling Helen Argeian, he certainly"
21009,SECTION VI.,"expresses something of general sympathy towards her. No other person,"
21010,SECTION VI.,"except only Juno, is called Argeian. Plainly the effect of his epithets"
21011,SECTION VI.,"for her as a whole is quite out of harmony with the ideas, which the"
21012,SECTION VI.,later tradition has attached to her name. A yet more marked indication
21013,SECTION VI.,"in her favour, than any of them taken singly will supply, may be"
21014,SECTION VI.,"derived from his likening her, in the palace of Menelaus, to Diana:"

21023,SECTION VI.,
21024,SECTION VI.,So much with regard to the designations applied to Helen in the Iliad

21026,SECTION VI.,"so far as the matter of chastity is concerned, without any fault other"
21027,SECTION VI.,than the inevitable one of her position. Besides other qualities that
21028,SECTION VI.,"will be noticed presently, she appears in the light of a refined and"
21029,SECTION VI.,"feeling, a blameless and even matronly person; a character, which, as"
21030,SECTION VI.,"we shall see, her abduction by Paris from Menelaus did not disentitle"
21031,SECTION VI.,her to bear.
21032,SECTION VI.,
21033,SECTION VI.,"We must beware of applying unconditionally, to women placed under"
21034,SECTION VI.,"conditions widely different, ideas so specifically Christian as those"
21035,SECTION VI.,that belong to the absolute sanctity of the marriage tie. We must
21036,SECTION VI.,rather look for the moral aspect of the case in the opinions of the
21037,SECTION VI.,"period, and in the particular circumstances which attended the rupture"
21038,SECTION VI.,"of the bond in the given instance, than assume it from the naked fact"
21039,SECTION VI.,that there was a rupture.
21040,SECTION VI.,
21041,SECTION VI.,~_The case of Bathsheba._~
21042,SECTION VI.,
21043,SECTION VI.,It may seem not unfair to compare the case of Helen with the somewhat
21044,SECTION VI.,similar case of Bathsheba among the Jews. If on the one hand we are
21045,SECTION VI.,"bound to bear in mind the inferior station of the latter personage, on"
21046,SECTION VI.,the other it is to be remembered that the Greeks were further removed
21047,SECTION VI.,from the light of Divine Revelation. Now we are not accustomed to look
21048,SECTION VI.,"upon the character of Bathsheba as infamous, though she lived with King"
21049,SECTION VI.,"David as one among his wives, while Uriah, her former husband, who"
21050,SECTION VI.,"had been robbed of her, was sent to certain death on her account; and"
21051,SECTION VI.,"this, so far as we are informed, without awakening in her any peculiar"
21052,SECTION VI.,"emotions of sympathy, sorrow, reluctance, or remorse. And this, as I"
21053,SECTION VI.,"take it, mainly for two reasons--first, that we have no signs of any"
21054,SECTION VI.,"passion, and in particular of any antecedent passion, for the offending"
21055,SECTION VI.,"king on her part; secondly, that she does not appear to have been"
21056,SECTION VI.,otherwise than passively a party to the abduction.
21057,SECTION VI.,
21058,SECTION VI.,"It is in the capacity of wife, and only wife, to Paris that Helen"
21059,SECTION VI.,appears to us in the Iliad: where she herself speaks of Menelaus as her
21060,SECTION VI.,πρότερος πόσις[1014].
21061,SECTION VI.,
21062,SECTION VI.,"[1014] Il. iii. 429 cf. 163. See Ilios, pp. 200, 203."
21063,SECTION VI.,
21064,SECTION VI.,Now the presumed reasons for not regarding the character of Bathsheba
21065,SECTION VI.,as infamous apply with nearly equal force to Helen. Indeed the
21066,SECTION VI.,character of Helen in one point stands higher in Homer than that of
21067,SECTION VI.,"Bathsheba in the Old Testament, because she lived with Paris as a"
21068,SECTION VI.,"recognised and only wife, and because of her gentleness, and especially"
21069,SECTION VI.,"of her repentance. Of these as to Bathsheba, we know nothing; but such"
21070,SECTION VI.,pleas as tell for her tell in the main also for Helen. We have no
21071,SECTION VI.,"indication, either in the Iliad or in the Odyssey, of her having at"
21072,SECTION VI.,any time felt either passion or affection towards the worthless Paris.
21073,SECTION VI.,"Above all, as it will be attempted to prove, the language of the poems"
21074,SECTION VI.,not only does not sustain the idea that she willingly left the house of
21075,SECTION VI.,"her husband Menelaus, but it shows something which closely approaches"
21076,SECTION VI.,to the direct contrary.
21077,SECTION VI.,
21078,SECTION VI.,But there is no method of measuring so accurately the view and
21079,SECTION VI.,intention of Homer as to the impression we were meant to receive of
21080,SECTION VI.,"Helen, as by comparing the language he applies to her with the widely"
21081,SECTION VI.,"different terms in which he describes the conduct of Clytemnestra, in"
21082,SECTION VI.,"conjunction with Ægisthus, during the absence of Agamemnon:"
21083,SECTION VI.,
21084,SECTION VI.,τὴν δ’ ἐθέλων ἐθέλουσαν ἀνήγαγεν ὅνδε δόμονδε[1015].
21085,SECTION VI.,
21086,SECTION VI.,[1015] Od. iii. 272.
21087,SECTION VI.,
21088,SECTION VI.,"In speaking of her own abduction, Helen indeed uses the word"
21089,SECTION VI.,"ἤγαγε[1016]. And again in her sharp expostulation with Aphrodite,"
21090,SECTION VI.,"she says, ‘What, will you take me (ἄξεις) to some other Phrygian or"
21091,SECTION VI.,"Mæonian city, where you may have a favourite[1017]?’ Now this by no"
21092,SECTION VI.,means implies her having acted freely; the word ἄγειν is that commonly
21093,SECTION VI.,"applied to the carrying off captives from a conquered city, as φέρειν"
21094,SECTION VI.,is to the removal of inanimate objects. Undoubtedly in one of her
21095,SECTION VI.,passages of self-reproach she says[1018]:
21096,SECTION VI.,
21097,SECTION VI.,[1016] Od. iv. 262; Il. xxiv. 764.
21098,SECTION VI.,
21099,SECTION VI.,[1017] Il. iii. 400-2.

21102,SECTION VI.,
21103,SECTION VI.,"υἱέϊ σῷ ἑπόμην, θάλαμον γνωτούς τε λιποῦσα."
21104,SECTION VI.,
21105,SECTION VI.,"But, in the first place, it is neither here nor anywhere else said that"
21106,SECTION VI.,"her flight was voluntary; and on the other hand, without doubt, it is"
21107,SECTION VI.,not to be pretended that she had resisted with the spirit of a martyr.
21108,SECTION VI.,The real question is as to the first and fatal act of quitting her
21109,SECTION VI.,"husband, whether it was premeditated, and whether it was of her free"
21110,SECTION VI.,choice. Now both branches of this question appear to be conclusively
21111,SECTION VI.,"decided by the word ἁρπάξας in the following passage[1019], spoken by"
21112,SECTION VI.,Paris:
21113,SECTION VI.,
21114,SECTION VI.,[1019] Ibid. 442-4.
21115,SECTION VI.,
21116,SECTION VI.,"οὐ γὰρ πώποτέ μ’ ὧδέ γ’ Ἔρως φρένας ἀμφεκάλυψεν,"
21117,SECTION VI.,οὐδ’ ὅτε σε πρῶτον Λακεδαίμονος ἐξ ἐρατεινῆς
21118,SECTION VI.,ἔπλεον ἁρπάξας ἐν ποντοπόροισι νέεσσιν.
21119,SECTION VI.,
21120,SECTION VI.,"And the rest of the passage corroborates the evidence, by showing that"
21121,SECTION VI.,she was free from any act of guilt at the time when the voyage was

21123,SECTION VI.,"Iliad, accords with the speech of Paris. He charges that Prince and his"

21141,SECTION VI.,
21142,SECTION VI.,"Let us now follow the character of Helen, as it is exhibited in life"
21143,SECTION VI.,"and motion before us by the Poet. In the Third Book, when Paris is"
21144,SECTION VI.,"about to encounter Menelaus, Iris, in the form of her sister-in-law"
21145,SECTION VI.,"Laodice, announces the fact to Helen, and lets her know that her own"
21146,SECTION VI.,"fate is suspended on the issue, which will decide whether she is to"
21147,SECTION VI.,be the wife of Paris or of Menelaus. Laodice finds her busied in
21148,SECTION VI.,"embroidery, which is to represent the War of Greeks and Trojans. The"
21149,SECTION VI.,"expression, νύμφα φίλη, with which the disguised goddess addresses her,"
21150,SECTION VI.,"is a sign that she was held in respect, and that when she speaks[1022]"
21151,SECTION VI.,"in the last Book of the taunts and skits of which she was the object,"
21152,SECTION VI.,we must understand her to use the natural exaggeration of impassioned
21153,SECTION VI.,"grief. At the call of the seeming Laodice, moved apparently by"
21154,SECTION VI.,"tenderness towards her former husband[1023], Helen goes forth, clad in"
21155,SECTION VI.,a robe of simple white[1024]. On her reaching the walls Priam calls
21156,SECTION VI.,"her to his side, that she may tell him the name of a kingly warrior,"
21157,SECTION VI.,"who proves to be Agamemnon. In doing this, he gently acquits her of"
21158,SECTION VI.,all responsibility for the war. She answers in a speech of uncommon
21159,SECTION VI.,"grace, ‘that she dreads while she reveres and loves him: would that"
21160,SECTION VI.,"she had miserably died rather than leave her family, her nuptial bed,"
21161,SECTION VI.,"her infant, and her friends. But this could not be; so that she ever"
21162,SECTION VI.,pined away in tears.’ She designates herself here and elsewhere[1025]
21163,SECTION VI.,"as κύων, and also as κύνωπις, brazen-faced or shameless; but yet she"
21164,SECTION VI.,appears at all times to have retained the fond recollection of her home
21165,SECTION VI.,"and friends[1026], and to have lived in grave and sorrowful retirement."
21166,SECTION VI.,"Everywhere she seems not only not to avoid, but to search for, the"
21167,SECTION VI.,"opportunity of bitter self-accusation. Thus, when she has pointed out"
21168,SECTION VI.,"the Greek chieftains whom she knew personally, she proceeds, ‘but I do"
21169,SECTION VI.,"not see my brothers, Castor and Polydeuces: perhaps they came not from"
21170,SECTION VI.,"Greece; perhaps, though here, yet on account of my infamy and reproach,"
21171,SECTION VI.,they will not appear in fight[1027].’

21187,SECTION VI.,evidently hoping that the hour of her restoration had now at last

21189,SECTION VI.,form of an aged servant; and endeavours to attract her by a glowing
21190,SECTION VI.,"description of Paris, in his beauty and his splendid garments. By"
21191,SECTION VI.,this address Helen was alarmed[1028]: and her alarm almost became
21192,SECTION VI.,"stupefaction, when she perceived the features of the deity. But a"
21193,SECTION VI.,strong reaction followed: so that she made a bitter and stinging
21194,SECTION VI.,"reply. Gentle on all other occasions, she is here sharp and sarcastic."
21195,SECTION VI.,She[1029] reproaches Venus with having come to prevent Menelaus from
21196,SECTION VI.,taking her home in right of his victory; then bids her assume to
21197,SECTION VI.,herself the odious character she sought to force on one who had too
21198,SECTION VI.,"long borne it, and utterly refuses to go. Venus hereupon intimidates"
21199,SECTION VI.,"her, by a threat of making her hateful alike to Greek and Trojan, and"
21200,SECTION VI.,"so bringing her to miserable destruction. She then obeys, covering"
21201,SECTION VI.,her face in shame and indignation; and when placed by the goddess in
21202,SECTION VI.,"front of Paris in their chamber, she sharply reproaches him; but the"
21203,SECTION VI.,"real delicacy of her character is maintained in this, that she does it"
21204,SECTION VI.,"ὄσσε πάλιν κλίνασα, with averted and downcast eyes. In what follows,"
21205,SECTION VI.,"she is but the reluctant instrument of a passion, which Homer seems to"
21206,SECTION VI.,"have described in this place, contrary to his wont, with the distinct"
21207,SECTION VI.,"purpose of raising indignation to the highest pitch, and covering Paris"
21208,SECTION VI.,"with a contempt and shame proportioned to the crime he had committed,"
21209,SECTION VI.,and to the miseries of which by crime he had been the cause.
21210,SECTION VI.,
21211,SECTION VI.,[1028] The expression is θυμὸν ἐνὶ στήθεσσιν ὄρινεν. The verb is used
21212,SECTION VI.,by Homer most commonly to denote apprehension (as in Il. iv. 208. xv.
21213,SECTION VI.,"7. xvi. 280, 509. xviii. 223); though it also sometimes signifies other"
21214,SECTION VI.,"kinds of excitement, such as anger or surprise."

21217,SECTION VI.,
21218,SECTION VI.,"Upon the whole, this delineation of Helen in the Third Book may well"
21219,SECTION VI.,be taken as one of the most masterly parts of the Iliad. The extreme
21220,SECTION VI.,fineness and delicacy of its shading mark it as an immortal work of
21221,SECTION VI.,"genius, and the gentleness of Helen towards Priam, with her severity to"
21222,SECTION VI.,"herself, and her sternness both to the corrupter, and to the goddess"
21223,SECTION VI.,"that aided and inspired him, form a moral picture of the most striking"
21224,SECTION VI.,"truth and beauty. Indeed, if the question be asked, where does Paganism"
21225,SECTION VI.,come nearest to the penitential tone and the profound self-abasement
21226,SECTION VI.,"that belong to Christianity, we might find it difficult to point out an"

21238,SECTION VI.,"of the shame of her husband’s cowardice, though without interest in his"
21239,SECTION VI.,"fame, she has been persuading him to go forth and fight; and she takes"
21240,SECTION VI.,the opportunity of Hector’s presence to offer him a chair that he may
21241,SECTION VI.,"rest from his fatigues; to revile herself as, next to her husband, the"
21242,SECTION VI.,"cause of them; and, while grieving that she had outlived her infancy,"

21256,SECTION VI.,We now bid adieu to the Helen of Homer in her sorrow and shame among

21258,SECTION VI.,"domestic peace, as the Queen of Menelaus; who, though not the heir"
21259,SECTION VI.,"of the high throne of Agamemnon, yet held a station in Greece, after"
21260,SECTION VI.,"the Return, of highly elevated influence. This is a picture, which"
21261,SECTION VI.,it would not have been in accordance with the usual course of Homer
21262,SECTION VI.,"to set before us, had his mind attached to Helen the character given"
21263,SECTION VI.,to her by the later tradition; for where does he represent to us the
21264,SECTION VI.,"wicked in prosperity, without bringing down on them subsequently the"
21265,SECTION VI.,vengeance of heaven? But on the Helen of the Odyssey he has left no
21266,SECTION VI.,"note of sorrow, except the most moving and appropriate of all, namely"
21267,SECTION VI.,"this, that the gods gave her no child after Hermione, the daughter of"
21268,SECTION VI.,her early youth[1032].

21274,SECTION VI.,"first her seat, the second its covering, the third her work-basket and"
21275,SECTION VI.,"distaff. She remarks on the likeness of Telemachus to Ulysses, and"
21276,SECTION VI.,"humbly recollects to confess, that she herself has been the cause of"
21277,SECTION VI.,the sufferings of the Greeks. The allusions then made to Ulysses cause
21278,SECTION VI.,"her, with the rest, to weep tenderly; and when her husband with his"
21279,SECTION VI.,"friends resumes the banquet, she infuses into their wine the soothing"
21280,SECTION VI.,"drug, supposed to have been opium, which she had obtained from Egypt,"
21281,SECTION VI.,to make them forgetful of their sorrows. Then she begins to tell tales
21282,SECTION VI.,"in honour of Ulysses: and how, when in his beggar’s dress he escaped"
21283,SECTION VI.,"scatheless from Troy, and left many of the Trojans slaughtered behind"
21284,SECTION VI.,"him, she alone, amidst the wailings of the women, was full of joy, for"
21285,SECTION VI.,her heart had been yearning towards her home.
21286,SECTION VI.,
21287,SECTION VI.,"There is indeed a trait that deserves notice in the speech of Menelaus,"
21288,SECTION VI.,"which has been lately mentioned. Helen came down to detect, if"
21289,SECTION VI.,"possible, the Greeks concealed within the Horse: therefore, to act"
21290,SECTION VI.,"in the interest of the Trojans. Now if, on the one hand, she looked"
21291,SECTION VI.,"back on her country and her first husband with many yearnings, yet"
21292,SECTION VI.,"it was not to be wondered at that as a woman, nowhere pretending"
21293,SECTION VI.,"to the character of a heroine, she should be so far pliable to the"
21294,SECTION VI.,wishes or subject to the compulsion of the Trojans--especially when we
21295,SECTION VI.,"remember her love and reverence for their head, and for Hector, who"
21296,SECTION VI.,had but lately died in their defence--as to make this effort to defeat
21297,SECTION VI.,"the stratagem of the besiegers. But Menelaus, in referring to the"
21298,SECTION VI.,"incident, carefully spares Helen’s feelings by another of those strokes"
21299,SECTION VI.,of exceeding tact and refinement for which Homer’s writings are so
21300,SECTION VI.,"remarkable, both generally, and as to the chivalrous character of this"
21301,SECTION VI.,"hero in particular. ‘Thither,’ he says, that is to the Horse, ‘thou"
21302,SECTION VI.,"camest; and no doubt,’ he adds, ‘it was the influence of some celestial"

21315,SECTION VI.,"yet sufficiently, by the Odyssey; for, says Menelaus, when the Greeks"
21316,SECTION VI.,"had constructed the Horse, and when Helen was brought down to detect"
21317,SECTION VI.,"those who were within it, by imitating the voices of their wives"
21318,SECTION VI.,"respectively, it is added,"

21326,SECTION VI.,with Menelaus.
21327,SECTION VI.,
21328,SECTION VI.,"Presuming therefore that this tale was well founded, it may be"
21329,SECTION VI.,"remarked, that the selection of Deiphobus, as the person who should"
21330,SECTION VI.,"take Helen to wife, was probably founded on his superior merit[1035]."
21331,SECTION VI.,"It was under his image, that Minerva came upon the field to inveigle"
21332,SECTION VI.,Hector into facing Achilles: and Hector then described him as the one
21333,SECTION VI.,"whom he loved by far the best amidst his full brothers, the children of"
21334,SECTION VI.,"Priam and of Hecuba. This therefore thoroughly accords with the idea,"
21335,SECTION VI.,"that Helen was held in respect. Nor let it be thought strange, that"
21336,SECTION VI.,she was not permitted to remain single. The idea of single life for
21337,SECTION VI.,"women, outside their fathers’ home, seems to have been wholly unknown"
21338,SECTION VI.,"among the Greeks of Homer. When marriageable, they married; when their"
21339,SECTION VI.,"country was overcome, they became, as of course, the appendages of the"
21340,SECTION VI.,"couch of the captor. Penelope herself never dreamt of urging that, when"
21341,SECTION VI.,"once the return of Ulysses was out of the question, she could have"
21342,SECTION VI.,any other option than to make choice among the Suitors whose wife she
21343,SECTION VI.,would become. Telemachus contemplates her immediate restoration to her
21344,SECTION VI.,"father’s home when he, her son, should assume the full prerogatives of"
21345,SECTION VI.,manhood.

21347,SECTION VI.,"[1035] Lycophron, 168; Schol. on Il. xxiv. 251. In the Troades of"
21348,SECTION VI.,"Euripides she is introduced, saying that Deiphobus took her by force,"
21349,SECTION VI.,"against the will of the Phrygians (Trojans), 954-5."
21350,SECTION VI.,
21351,SECTION VI.,"The whole Homeric evidence, then, appears to show that, from the"
21352,SECTION VI.,"moment of her removal, neither the usages of society, nor the ideas of"
21353,SECTION VI.,"religion or the moral code, could allow Helen to remain in the single"
21354,SECTION VI.,state. But it may be said this seems to prove too much on her behalf;
21355,SECTION VI.,"namely, that both the abduction and the subsequent life were against"
21356,SECTION VI.,"her will. It is, however, entirely in keeping with the testimony of the"
21357,SECTION VI.,"poems, to suppose that her whole offence lay in having permitted at"
21358,SECTION VI.,"the first, perhaps half unconsciously, the attentions of a flatterer,"
21359,SECTION VI.,who became at once a paramour and a tyrant to his victim. In order to
21360,SECTION VI.,"comprehend the heroic age, it is indispensable that we should recollect"
21361,SECTION VI.,that the responsibilities of women were contracted in proportion to her
21362,SECTION VI.,"strength; and that the heroism of endurance, in which she has since"
21363,SECTION VI.,"excelled, is a Christian product."
21364,SECTION VI.,
21365,SECTION VI.,That element of weakness and lightness in a character otherwise
21366,SECTION VI.,"beautiful, which the incident of the Horse betrays, was probably at"
21367,SECTION VI.,once the source and the measure of her offending in reference to the
21368,SECTION VI.,"cause of war. It was a mind of relaxed fibre, and vacillated under"
21369,SECTION VI.,"pressure. Less than this we cannot suppose, and there is no occasion"
21370,SECTION VI.,"to suppose more. The respect felt, within certain limits, for women in"
21371,SECTION VI.,"the heroic age, and so powerfully proved by the Odyssey, may perhaps"
21372,SECTION VI.,be adverse to the supposition that Paris carried her away without
21373,SECTION VI.,"some degree of previous encouragement. I confine myself to ‘perhaps,’"
21374,SECTION VI.,"because it is nowhere indicated in the poems, and we can at most have"
21375,SECTION VI.,"only a presumption to this effect. On the other hand, it seems certain"
21376,SECTION VI.,"that what she expiated in life-long sadness was, at any rate, no more"
21377,SECTION VI.,"than the first step in the ways of folly, the thoughtless error of"
21378,SECTION VI.,"short-sighted vanity, which the state of manners did not permit her"
21379,SECTION VI.,subsequently to redeem. Repent she might: but to return was beyond her
21380,SECTION VI.,power.
21381,SECTION VI.,
21382,SECTION VI.,"On the whole, it may be said with confidence that the Helen of the"
21383,SECTION VI.,"Homeric poems has been conceived, by an author himself of peculiar"
21384,SECTION VI.,"delicacy, with great truth of nature, and with no intention to deprive"
21385,SECTION VI.,her of a share in the sympathies of his hearers; that he has made her
21386,SECTION VI.,"a woman, not cast in the mould of martyrs, nor elevated in moral ideas"
21387,SECTION VI.,"to a capacity of comprehension and of endurance above her age, but yet"
21388,SECTION VI.,"endowed with much tenderness of feeling, with the highest grace and"
21389,SECTION VI.,"refinement, and with a deep and peculiar sense of shame for having"
21390,SECTION VI.,"done wrong. Probably her appreciation of virtue and of honour, though"
21391,SECTION VI.,"beneath that of the highest matronly characters, may have been in no"
21392,SECTION VI.,"way inferior to that of society at large in her own time, and superior"
21393,SECTION VI.,to the standard of many following epochs; nay superior also to that
21394,SECTION VI.,"which has prevailed, at least locally, even at some periods of the"
21395,SECTION VI.,"Christian era: as, for example, when Ariosto wrote the remarkable"

21407,SECTION VI.,The degradation of Helen by the later tradition will be treated of
21408,SECTION VI.,hereafter. Meantime it will be seen how much on this subject I have
21409,SECTION VI.,"the misfortune to differ from Mure, who has been usually so great a"
21410,SECTION VI.,benefactor to the students of Homer. With him ‘Helen is the female
21411,SECTION VI.,counterpart of Paris[1037].’ Paris and Helen are respectively ‘the
21412,SECTION VI.,man of fashion and the woman of pleasure of the heroic age.’ ‘Both
21413,SECTION VI.,are unprincipled votaries of sensual enjoyment; both self-willed and
21414,SECTION VI.,"petulant, but not devoid of amiable and generous feeling.’ He finds"
21415,SECTION VI.,indeed in her a ‘tenderness of heart and kindly disposition;’ and
21416,SECTION VI.,says that ‘traces of better principle seem also to lurk under the
21417,SECTION VI.,"general levity of her habits.’ This petulance, this general levity,"
21418,SECTION VI.,"I do not find; but rather the notes of a fatal fall, continually and"
21419,SECTION VI.,deeply felt under the general grace and beauty of her character. What
21420,SECTION VI.,"Mure calls her ‘petulant argument with her patron goddess,’ we take"
21421,SECTION VI.,to be the noble and indignant reaction of a soul under the yoke of
21422,SECTION VI.,"conscious slavery, and still quick to the throb of virtue. Indeed I"
21423,SECTION VI.,"derive some comfort from the closing words of his criticism, in which,"
21424,SECTION VI.,"after expressing his pity and condemnation, he says that still ‘we are"
21425,SECTION VI.,constrained to love and admire.’ In the whole circle of the classical
21426,SECTION VI.,"literature, as far as it is known to us, there is, I repeat, nothing"
21427,SECTION VI.,that approaches so nearly to what Christian theology would term a sense
21428,SECTION VI.,"of sin, as the humble demeanour, and the self-denouncing, self-stabbing"

21437,SECTION VI.,"hand slightly, nor on the other too elaborately, drawn; the touches are"
21438,SECTION VI.,"just such and so many, as his poetic purpose seemed on the one hand to"
21439,SECTION VI.,"demand, and on the other to admit. Paris is not indeed the gentleman,"
21440,SECTION VI.,"but he is the fine gentleman, and the pattern voluptuary, of the heroic"
21441,SECTION VI.,ages; and all his successors in these capacities may well be wished joy
21442,SECTION VI.,"of their illustrious prototype. The redeeming, or at least relieving"
21443,SECTION VI.,"point in his character, is one which would condemn any personage"
21444,SECTION VI.,of higher intellectual or moral pretensions; it is a total want of
21445,SECTION VI.,"earnestness, the unbroken sway of levity and of indifference to all"
21446,SECTION VI.,serious and manly considerations. He completely fulfils the idea of the
21447,SECTION VI.,"_poco-curante_, except as to the display of his personal beauty, the"
21448,SECTION VI.,"enjoyment of luxury, and the resort to sensuality as the best refuge"
21449,SECTION VI.,"from pain and care. He is not a monster, for he is neither savage nor"
21450,SECTION VI.,"revengeful; but still further is he from being one of Homer’s heroes,"
21451,SECTION VI.,"for he has neither honour, courage, eloquence, thought, nor prudence."
21452,SECTION VI.,"That he bears the reproaches of Hector without irritation, is due to"
21453,SECTION VI.,"that same moral apathy, and that narrowness of intelligence, which"
21454,SECTION VI.,makes him insensible to those of his wife. No man can seriously resent
21455,SECTION VI.,what he does not really feel. He is wholly destitute even of the
21456,SECTION VI.,delicacy and refinement which soften many of the features of vice; and
21457,SECTION VI.,the sensuality he shows in the Third Book[1038] partakes largely of the
21458,SECTION VI.,"brutal character which marks the lusts of Jupiter. No wise, no generous"
21459,SECTION VI.,"word, ever passes from his lips. On one subject only he is determined"
21460,SECTION VI.,"enough; it is, that he will not give up the woman whom he well knows to"
21461,SECTION VI.,"be without attachment to him[1039], and whom he keeps not as the object"
21462,SECTION VI.,"of his affections, but merely as the instrument of his pleasures. One"
21463,SECTION VI.,"solicitude only he cherishes; it is to decorate his person, to exhibit"
21464,SECTION VI.,"his beauty, to brighten with care the arms that he would fain parade,"
21465,SECTION VI.,but has not the courage to employ against the warriors of Greece.

21470,SECTION VI.,
21471,SECTION VI.,"There are other greater achievements in the Iliad, but none finer,"
21472,SECTION VI.,"or more deserving our commendation, than the manner in which Homer"
21473,SECTION VI.,has handled the difficult character of Paris. It was quite necessary
21474,SECTION VI.,to raise him to a certain point of importance; had he been simply
21475,SECTION VI.,"contemptible, his place in the early stages of the Trojan tale, and"
21476,SECTION VI.,"the prolongation of the War on his account, would have involved a"
21477,SECTION VI.,too violent departure from the laws of poetical credibility. This
21478,SECTION VI.,"importance Homer, whether from imagination or from history, has"
21479,SECTION VI.,supplied; in part by his very high position. Even if I were wrong in
21480,SECTION VI.,"the opinion that the Poet meant to represent him as the eldest son, or"
21481,SECTION VI.,"the eldest living son, of Priam, it would still at least be plain that"
21482,SECTION VI.,he is more eminent and conspicuous than any other member of the royal
21483,SECTION VI.,"house after Hector; while he is so much less worthy than Deiphobus,"
21484,SECTION VI.,"for example, that no one, I think, could doubt that his distinction is"
21485,SECTION VI.,"due to his being senior to that respectable prince and warrior, and"
21486,SECTION VI.,"to the rest of his brothers. Further, the Poet has raised him to the"
21487,SECTION VI.,"very highest elevation in two particulars; one the gift of archery,"
21488,SECTION VI.,the other the endowment of corporeal grace and beauty. But neither of
21489,SECTION VI.,"these involves one particle of courage, or of any other virtue; for the"
21490,SECTION VI.,"archer of Homer’s time was not like the British bowman, who stood with"
21491,SECTION VI.,"his comrades in the line, and discharged the function in war which has"
21492,SECTION VI.,"since fallen to musketry; he was a mere sharpshooter, always having the"
21493,SECTION VI.,"most deliberate opportunity of aim at the enemy, and always himself out"
21494,SECTION VI.,"of danger. No archer is ever hit in the Iliad; but Pandarus, so skilled"
21495,SECTION VI.,"in the bow, is slain, and Paris is disgraced, when they respectively"
21496,SECTION VI.,"venture to assume the spear. Again, the Poet has contrived that the"
21497,SECTION VI.,"accomplishments of Paris, though in themselves unsurpassed, shall"
21498,SECTION VI.,"attract towards him no share, great or small, of our regard. This"
21499,SECTION VI.,"prince really does more, than even Hector does, to stay the torrent of"
21500,SECTION VI.,"the Grecian war; for in the Eleventh Book, from behind a pillar, he"
21501,SECTION VI.,"wounds Diomed, who had fought with the Immortals, Eurypylus, who had"
21502,SECTION VI.,"also been one of the nine accepters of Hector’s challenge, and Machaon,"
21503,SECTION VI.,one of the two surgeons. Thus Homer[1040] has been able to make him
21504,SECTION VI.,"most useful in battle, most lovely to the eye, and yet alike detestable"
21505,SECTION VI.,and detested.

21509,SECTION VI.,"This aim he attains, not by that tame method of description which he so"
21510,SECTION VI.,"much eschews, but by the turn he gives to narrative, and by the colour"
21511,SECTION VI.,he imparts to it in one or a few words.
21512,SECTION VI.,
21513,SECTION VI.,"Paris, though effeminate and apathetic, is not gentle, either to his"
21514,SECTION VI.,"wife or his enemies; and, when he has wounded Diomed, he wishes the"
21515,SECTION VI.,shot had been a fatal one. The reply of Diomed cuts deeper than any
21516,SECTION VI.,"arrow when he addresses him as,"

21522,SECTION VI.,"Again, the Poet tells us, as if by accident, that when, after the"
21523,SECTION VI.,"battle with Menelaus, he could not be found, it was not because the"
21524,SECTION VI.,"Trojans were unwilling to give him up, for they hated him with the"
21525,SECTION VI.,"hatred, which they felt to dark Death[1042]. And again we learn, how"
21526,SECTION VI.,he uses bribery to keep his ground in the Assembly; how he refuses to
21527,SECTION VI.,"recognise even his own military inferiority, but lamely accounts for"
21528,SECTION VI.,the success of Menelaus by saying that all men have their turn[1043];
21529,SECTION VI.,and how he causes shame to his own countrymen and exultation to the
21530,SECTION VI.,"Greeks, when they contrast the pretensions of his splendid appearance"
21531,SECTION VI.,with his miserable performances in the field[1044].

21538,SECTION VI.,
21539,SECTION VI.,"Homer, full as he is of the harmonies of nature, differs in this as in"
21540,SECTION VI.,"so many points from most among later writers, that he does not set at"
21541,SECTION VI.,"nought the due proportion between the moral and the intellectual man,"
21542,SECTION VI.,nor combine high gifts of mind with a mean and bad heart. He never
21543,SECTION VI.,varies from this rule; and he has been careful to pay it a marked
21544,SECTION VI.,observance in the case of Paris. No set of speeches in the Iliad are
21545,SECTION VI.,marked by greater poverty of ideas. If he cleans his arms and builds
21546,SECTION VI.,"his house, which are honourable employments, they are employments"
21547,SECTION VI.,immediately connected with the ostentation to which he was so much
21548,SECTION VI.,"given. More than this, the Poet informs us, through the medium of"
21549,SECTION VI.,"Helen, that he was but ill supplied with sense, and that he was too old"
21550,SECTION VI.,to mend:
21551,SECTION VI.,

21556,SECTION VI.,
21557,SECTION VI.,"The immediate transition, in the Third Book, from the field of battle,"
21558,SECTION VI.,"where he was disgraced, to the bed of luxury, is admirably suited to"
21559,SECTION VI.,"impress upon the mind, by the strong contrast, the real character of"
21560,SECTION VI.,"Paris. Nor let it be thought, that Homer has gratuitously forced upon"
21561,SECTION VI.,us the scene between him and his reluctant wife. It was just that he
21562,SECTION VI.,"should mark as a bad man him who had sinned grossly, selfishly, and"
21563,SECTION VI.,"fatally, alike against Greece and his own family and country. This"
21564,SECTION VI.,impression would not have been consistent and thorough in all its
21565,SECTION VI.,"parts, if we had been even allowed to suppose that, as a refined,"
21566,SECTION VI.,"affectionate, and tender husband, he made such amends to Helen as the"
21567,SECTION VI.,case permitted for the wrong done her in his hot and heady youth. Such
21568,SECTION VI.,"a supposition might excusably have been entertained, and it would have"
21569,SECTION VI.,been supported by the very feebleness of the character of Paris and
21570,SECTION VI.,"by his part in the war, had Homer been silent upon the subject. He,"
21571,SECTION VI.,"therefore, though with cautious hand, lifts the veil so far as to show"
21572,SECTION VI.,us that in our variously compounded nature animal desire can use up
21573,SECTION VI.,"and absorb the strength which ought to nerve our higher faculties, and"
21574,SECTION VI.,"that, as none are more cruel than the timid, so none are more brutal"
21575,SECTION VI.,than the effeminate.
21576,SECTION VI.,
21577,SECTION VI.,"One hold, and one only, Paris seems to retain on human affection in"
21578,SECTION VI.,any sort or form. The paternal instinct of Priam makes him shudder and
21579,SECTION VI.,"retire, when he is told that Paris is about to meet Menelaus in single"
21580,SECTION VI.,combat. This trait would have been of extraordinary and universal
21581,SECTION VI.,"beauty, had the object of the affection been even moderately worthy:"
21582,SECTION VI.,"it is a remarkable proof of the debasement of Paris, and of the strong"
21583,SECTION VI.,"sense which Homer gives us of that debasement, that the tender father"
21584,SECTION VI.,seems in a measure tainted by the very warmth and strength of his love.

21595,SECT. VII.,
21596,SECT. VII.,"One legitimate mode of measuring the true greatness of Homer is, by"
21597,SECT. VII.,observing what has become of the materials and instruments he worked
21598,SECT. VII.,"with, upon their passing into other hands. Acting on this principle,"
21599,SECT. VII.,"let us now pass on to consider the murderous maltreatment, which the"
21600,SECT. VII.,most remarkable of all the Homeric characters have had to endure in
21601,SECT. VII.,"the later tradition; partly, as I have already observed, from general,"
21602,SECT. VII.,and partly from special causes. On the more general influence of this
21603,SECT. VII.,"kind I have already touched. Among the special causes, we should place"
21604,SECT. VII.,the declension in the fundamental ideas of morals and of politics
21605,SECT. VII.,between the time of Homer and the historic age. With this we may
21606,SECT. VII.,"reckon one which, though it may appear to be technical, must, in all"
21607,SECT. VII.,"likelihood, have been most important, namely, the physical necessities"
21608,SECT. VII.,imposed by the fixed conditions of dramatic representation among the
21609,SECT. VII.,"Greeks[1047]. Their theatres were constructed on a scale, which may be"
21610,SECT. VII.,called colossal as compared with ours. Both polity and religion entered
21611,SECT. VII.,into the institution of the stage. The intense nationality of their
21612,SECT. VII.,"life required a similar character in their plays, and likewise in the"
21613,SECT. VII.,places where they were to be represented. Not therefore a particular
21614,SECT. VII.,"company of auditors, but rather the whole public of the city, where the"
21615,SECT. VII.,"representation took place, was to be accommodated. In consequence, the"
21616,SECT. VII.,dimensions of the buildings exceeded the usual powers of the human eye
21617,SECT. VII.,"and ear; so that the figure was heightened by buskins, the countenance"
21618,SECT. VII.,"thrown into bolder and coarser outline by masks, and the voice endowed"
21619,SECT. VII.,with a great increase of power by acoustic contrivances within the
21620,SECT. VII.,"masks, as well as aided by the construction of the buildings. All this"
21621,SECT. VII.,"was the more strictly requisite, because the plays were acted in the"
21622,SECT. VII.,open air.

21626,SECT. VII.,
21627,SECT. VII.,Now this general exaggeration of feature beyond the standard of
21628,SECT. VII.,nature had an irresistible tendency to affect the mode in which
21629,SECT. VII.,characters were modelled for representation; to cause them to be laid
21630,SECT. VII.,"out morally as well as physically in strong outline, in masses large"
21631,SECT. VII.,and comparatively coarse. The fine and careful finishing of Homer
21632,SECT. VII.,"required that those, who were to recite him, should retain an entire"
21633,SECT. VII.,and unfettered command over the measure in which the bodily organs were
21634,SECT. VII.,to be employed. The τύνη δ’ ὠμοΐιν of Achilles to Patroclus might bear
21635,SECT. VII.,"to be spoken in a voice of thunder, and would absolutely require the"
21636,SECT. VII.,bard to use considerable exertion of the lungs; but the scenes of Helen
21637,SECT. VII.,"with Priam in the Third Book, of Hector with Andromache in the Sixth,"
21638,SECT. VII.,"of Priam with Achilles in the Twenty-fourth, would admit of no such"
21639,SECT. VII.,"treatment; and as these passages could not themselves be rendered, so"
21640,SECT. VII.,"neither could anything bearing a true analogy to Homer be given, unless"
21641,SECT. VII.,the actor had enjoyed full liberty to contract as well as expand his
21642,SECT. VII.,"own volume of sound, or unless he had enjoyed both easy access, on any"
21643,SECT. VII.,"terms he pleased, to the ears of his audience, and the full benefit of"
21644,SECT. VII.,"that most important assistance, which the eye renders to the ear by"
21645,SECT. VII.,"observing the play of countenance that accompanies delivery. King Lear,"
21646,SECT. VII.,"King John, or Othello, could not have been represented more truly and"
21647,SECT. VII.,"adequately in a Greek theatre, than the Achilles, or than the Helen,"
21648,SECT. VII.,of Homer. Those who have ever happened to discuss with a deaf person
21649,SECT. VII.,"a critical subject, requiring circumspect and tender handling, will"
21650,SECT. VII.,know how much the necessity for constant tension of the voice restrains
21651,SECT. VII.,"freedom in the expression of thought, and mars its perfectness. The"
21652,SECT. VII.,"Greek actors lay under a somewhat similar necessity, and to their"
21653,SECT. VII.,"necessities of course the diction of the tragedians was, whether"
21654,SECT. VII.,"consciously or unconsciously, adapted."
21655,SECT. VII.,
21656,SECT. VII.,"Let it, however, be borne in mind, that when we criticize the"
21657,SECT. VII.,"conceptions of the Homeric characters by the later Greek writers,"
21658,SECT. VII.,it need not be with the supposition that we have eyes to discern in
21659,SECT. VII.,Homer what they did not see. Their reproductions must be taken to
21660,SECT. VII.,represent not so much the free dictates of the mind and judgment of
21661,SECT. VII.,"the later poets, as the conditions of representation to which they"
21662,SECT. VII.,"were compelled to conform, and the popular sentiments and opinions"
21663,SECT. VII.,"which, in the character of popular writers, they could not but take"
21664,SECT. VII.,for their standard. The invention of printing has given a liberty and
21665,SECT. VII.,"independence to thought, at least in conjunction with poetry and the"
21666,SECT. VII.,"drama, such as it could not possess while the poet, in Athens for"
21667,SECT. VII.,"example, could sing in no other way but one, namely, to the nation"
21668,SECT. VII.,collected in a mass. The poet of modern times may write for a minority
21669,SECT. VII.,"of the public, nay, for a mere handful of admirers, which is destined,"
21670,SECT. VII.,"yet only in after-years, to grow like the mustard-seed of the parable."
21671,SECT. VII.,But the Athenian dramatist was compelled to be the poet of the majority
21672,SECT. VII.,"at the moment, and to be carried on the stream of its sympathies,"
21673,SECT. VII.,"however adverse its direction might be to that in which, if at liberty"
21674,SECT. VII.,"to choose, he would himself have moved."
21675,SECT. VII.,
21676,SECT. VII.,~_Obliteration of the finer distinctions._~
21677,SECT. VII.,
21678,SECT. VII.,"Accordingly, when we come to survey the literary history of those great"
21679,SECT. VII.,"characters which the Poet gave as a perpetual possession to the world,"
21680,SECT. VII.,"we find, naturally enough, that the flood of the more recent traditions"
21681,SECT. VII.,"has long ago come in upon the Homeric narrative, like the inundation"
21682,SECT. VII.,brought by Neptune and Apollo over the wall and trench of the Greeks.
21683,SECT. VII.,"Like every other deluge, in sweeping away the softer materials, which"
21684,SECT. VII.,"give the more refined lines to the picture, it leaves the comparatively"
21685,SECT. VII.,hard and sharp ones harder and sharper than ever. Thus it is with the
21686,SECT. VII.,"Homeric characters, transplanted into the later tradition. The broader"
21687,SECT. VII.,distinctions of his personages one from another have been not only
21688,SECT. VII.,"retained, but exaggerated: all the finer ones have disappeared. No"
21689,SECT. VII.,"one, deriving his ideas from Homer only, could confound Diomed with"
21690,SECT. VII.,"Ajax, or either with Agamemnon, or any of the three with Menelaus, or"
21691,SECT. VII.,any of the four with Achilles; but when we come down to the age of
21692,SECT. VII.,"the tragedians, what remains to mark them, except only for Agamemnon"
21693,SECT. VII.,"his office, and for Achilles his superiority in physical strength? In"
21694,SECT. VII.,"the Homeric poems, the strong and towering intellectual qualities even"
21695,SECT. VII.,outweigh the great physical and animal forces of his chief hero: by
21696,SECT. VII.,"the usual predominance in man of what is gross over what is fine, the"
21697,SECT. VII.,"principal and higher parts of his character are afterwards suppressed,"
21698,SECT. VII.,"and it becomes comparatively vulgarized. In the Ulysses of Homer,"
21699,SECT. VII.,"again, the intellectual element predominates in such a manner, that not"
21700,SECT. VII.,even the most superficial reader can fail to perceive it. He and Helen
21701,SECT. VII.,stand out in the Iliad from among others with whom they might have
21702,SECT. VII.,"been confounded; the first by virtue of his self-mastery and sagacity,"
21703,SECT. VII.,"the second, not only by her beauty and her fall, but by the singularly"
21704,SECT. VII.,"tender and ethereal shading of her character. The later tradition,"
21705,SECT. VII.,"laying rude hands upon the subtler distinctions thus established, has"
21706,SECT. VII.,"degraded these two great characters, the one into little better than a"
21707,SECT. VII.,"stage rogue, the other into little more than a stage voluptuary, who"
21708,SECT. VII.,adds to the guilt of that character the further and coarse enormities
21709,SECT. VII.,"of faithlessness, and even of bloodthirstiness."
21710,SECT. VII.,
21711,SECT. VII.,Even so soon as in the time of the Cyclical writers the character of
21712,SECT. VII.,"Helen had begun to be altered. In Homer she is the victim of Paris,"
21713,SECT. VII.,"carried off from her home and country, and only then yielding to his"
21714,SECT. VII.,"lust. In the Κύπρια ἔπη, as we have that poem reported by Proclus, she"
21715,SECT. VII.,"begins by receiving his gifts, that is to say, his bribes; she is an"
21716,SECT. VII.,"adulteress under her husband’s roof; and she joins in plundering him,"
21717,SECT. VII.,in order to escape with her paramour.
21718,SECT. VII.,
21719,SECT. VII.,It is in Euripides that we find the largest and most diversified
21720,SECT. VII.,"reproduction of the old Homeric characters, and to him, therefore,"
21721,SECT. VII.,"among the three tragedians, we should give our chief attention. When we"
21722,SECT. VII.,"consider them as a whole, according to his representation of them, we"
21723,SECT. VII.,find that their entire primitive and patriarchal colouring has gone.
21724,SECT. VII.,The manners are not those of any age in particular; least of all are
21725,SECT. VII.,"they the manners of a very early age. And, as the entire company has"
21726,SECT. VII.,"lost its distinctive type, so have the members of it when taken singly."
21727,SECT. VII.,"In the Troades, for example, Menelaus is simply the injured and"
21728,SECT. VII.,exasperated husband; Helen is the faithless wife; and she is kept up to
21729,SECT. VII.,a certain standard of dramatic importance in the eye of the world only
21730,SECT. VII.,"by another departure from the Homeric picture, for she is armed with"
21731,SECT. VII.,an enormous power of argument and sophistry. By a similar appendage of
21732,SECT. VII.,"ingenious disquisition, the essentially plain and matronly qualities of"
21733,SECT. VII.,"Hecuba have been overlaid and hidden. Achilles, in the Iphigenia, is"
21734,SECT. VII.,a gallant and a generous warrior; but we have neither the grandeur of
21735,SECT. VII.,"his tempestuous emotions as in Homer, nor, on the other hand, any of"
21736,SECT. VII.,that peculiar refinement with which they are in so admirable a manner
21737,SECT. VII.,"both blended and set in contrast. Agamemnon has lost, in Euripides,"
21738,SECT. VII.,"his vacillation and misgivings, and is the average and, so to speak,"
21739,SECT. VII.,"rounded king and warrior, instead of the mixed and particoloured, but"
21740,SECT. VII.,"in no sense common-place, character that Homer has made him. Though"
21741,SECT. VII.,"Andromache is a passionately fond mother, she has nothing whatever"
21742,SECT. VII.,"that identifies her as the original Andromache. Indeed, of the Homeric"
21743,SECT. VII.,"women, it may be said that in Euripides they have ceased to be womanly;"
21744,SECT. VII.,they have in general nothing of that adjective character (if the phrase
21745,SECT. VII.,"may be allowed), that ever leaning and clinging attitude, to which"
21746,SECT. VII.,"support from without is a moral necessity, and which so profoundly"
21747,SECT. VII.,"marks them all in Homer. Again, Iphigenia, Cassandra, Polyxena, who are"
21748,SECT. VII.,"either scarcely or not at all Homeric, have now become grand heroines,"
21749,SECT. VII.,with unbounded stage-effect; but there is no stage-effect at all in
21750,SECT. VII.,"Homer’s Helen, or in his Andromache. Andromache, for example, is not"
21751,SECT. VII.,elaborately drawn. She is rather a product of Homer’s character and
21752,SECT. VII.,"feeling, than of his art. She is simply what Tennyson in his ‘Isabel’"
21753,SECT. VII.,"calls ‘the stately flower of perfect wifehood.’ In her simplicity,"
21754,SECT. VII.,the true idea of her might easily have been preserved by the later
21755,SECT. VII.,"literature, had the conception of woman as such remained morally the"
21756,SECT. VII.,"same. But the Andromache of Homer was doomed to deteriorate, on account"
21757,SECT. VII.,"of her purity, as his Achilles, his Ulysses, his Helen degenerated,"
21758,SECT. VII.,"because the flights of such high genius could not be sustained, and"
21759,SECT. VII.,weaker wings drooped down to a lower level. As Hecuba was the aged
21760,SECT. VII.,"matron of the Iliad, and Helen its mixed type of woman, so Andromache"
21761,SECT. VII.,was the young mother and the wife. Her one only thought lay in her
21762,SECT. VII.,"husband and her child; but in the Troades, wordy and diffuse, she"
21763,SECT. VII.,"discusses, in a most business-like manner, the question whether she"
21764,SECT. VII.,"shall or shall not transfer her affections to the new lord, whose"
21765,SECT. VII.,"property she has become. She ends, indeed, by deciding the question"
21766,SECT. VII.,rightly; but it is one that the Homeric Andromache never could have
21767,SECT. VII.,entertained.
21768,SECT. VII.,
21769,SECT. VII.,"Three, however, among the Homeric characters, have been mangled by"
21770,SECT. VII.,the later tradition much more cruelly than any others; they are those
21771,SECT. VII.,"prime efforts of his mighty genius, Helen, Achilles, and Ulysses."
21772,SECT. VII.,"The first, most probably, on account of the wonderful delicacy with"
21773,SECT. VII.,which in Homer it is moulded: the others on account of their singular
21774,SECT. VII.,comprehensiveness and breadth of scope. Each of these three cases well
21775,SECT. VII.,deserves particular consideration.
21776,SECT. VII.,
21777,SECT. VII.,~_Mutilation of the Helen of Homer._~
21778,SECT. VII.,
21779,SECT. VII.,"In the case of Helen, the extreme tenderness of the colouring, that"
21780,SECT. VII.,"Homer has employed, multiplied infinitely the chances against its"
21781,SECT. VII.,"preservation. Among all the women of antiquity, she is by nature the"
21782,SECT. VII.,"most feminine, the finest in grain, though, as in many other instances,"
21783,SECT. VII.,a certain slightness of texture is essentially connected with this
21784,SECT. VII.,fineness. Her natural softness is very greatly deepened by the double
21785,SECT. VII.,effect of her affliction and her repentance. A quiet and settled
21786,SECT. VII.,"sadness broods over her whole image, and comes out not only when she"
21787,SECT. VII.,"weeps by the body of Hector, or when her husband’s presence reminds her"
21788,SECT. VII.,"of her offence, but even under the genial smiles and soothing words"
21789,SECT. VII.,of old Priam on the wall. Vehement and agonizing passion draws deep
21790,SECT. VII.,"strong lines, which, even in copies, may be easily caught and easily"
21791,SECT. VII.,preserved; it is quite different with the profound though low-toned
21792,SECT. VII.,"suffering, of which the passive influence, the penetrating tint,"
21793,SECT. VII.,"circulates as it were in every vein, and issues into view at every pore."

21796,SECT. VII.,
21797,SECT. VII.,"Let us now consider how the character of Helen reappears in Euripides,"
21798,SECT. VII.,"in Isocrates, and in Virgil."
21799,SECT. VII.,
21800,SECT. VII.,"In the Agamemnon, Æschylus had designated her under the form of a"
21801,SECT. VII.,"pun, as ἑλέναυς ἑλεπτόλις; and these phrases, as they stand, cannot"
21802,SECT. VII.,be said in any manner to force us beyond the limits of the Homeric
21803,SECT. VII.,"tradition. But in the Hecuba she is cursed outright by the Chorus,"
21804,SECT. VII.,"and represented by Hecuba herself as having been the great agent,"
21805,SECT. VII.,"instead of the passive occasion and the suffering instrument, in the"
21806,SECT. VII.,calamitous fall of Troy[1048]. In the Troades she is the shame of the
21807,SECT. VII.,"country, the slayer of Priam, the willing fugitive from Sparta[1049]."
21808,SECT. VII.,"Andromache denounces her in the fiercest manner, and gives her for her"
21809,SECT. VII.,"ancestors not Jupiter, but Death, Slaughter, Vengeance, Jealousy, and"
21810,SECT. VII.,"all the evils upon earth[1050]. Menelaus is furiously enraged, calls on"
21811,SECT. VII.,"his attendants to drag her in by her blood-guilty hair, will not give"
21812,SECT. VII.,"her the name of wife, will send her to Lacedæmon[1051], there herself"
21813,SECT. VII.,to die as a satisfaction to those whose death she has guiltily brought
21814,SECT. VII.,"about. When she asks whether she may be heard in defence of herself, he"

21839,SECT. VII.,"We have moreover an example, in the Helen painted by Euripides, of"
21840,SECT. VII.,"the rude manner in which characters not understood, and taken to be"
21841,SECT. VII.,"inconsistent by an age which had failed to understand them, were torn"
21842,SECT. VII.,"in pieces, and how the several fragments started anew, each for itself,"
21843,SECT. VII.,on the stream of tradition. In Homer we have the touching contrast
21844,SECT. VII.,"between the chastity of Helen’s mind, and the unlawful condition in"
21845,SECT. VII.,"which she lived. The latter, taken separately, was presumed to imply"
21846,SECT. VII.,an unchaste soul; the former a lawful condition. Instead therefore of
21847,SECT. VII.,"the one narrative, we have two; a shade or counterfeit of Helen plays"
21848,SECT. VII.,"the part of the adulteress with Paris, while the true and living Helen"
21849,SECT. VII.,"remains concealed in Egypt, keeping pure her husband’s bed, so that,"
21850,SECT. VII.,"though her name has become infamous, her body may remain untainted."
21851,SECT. VII.,"This latter tradition is chiefly valuable, because it marks the mode of"
21852,SECT. VII.,"transition from the Homeric to the spurious representations, and the"
21853,SECT. VII.,"consciousness of the early poets, that they were not preserving the"
21854,SECT. VII.,"image drawn by Homer. No scheme, however, constructed of such flimsy"
21855,SECT. VII.,"materials, could live; and, naturally enough, the character of Helen"
21856,SECT. VII.,"the wife was forgotten, that of Helen the voluptuary was preserved."
21857,SECT. VII.,
21858,SECT. VII.,From the vituperation and disgrace of Helen in most of the plays
21859,SECT. VII.,"of Euripides, we pass to the elaborate panegyric handed down to us"
21860,SECT. VII.,in the Ἐγκώμιον of Isocrates. The falsehood eulogistic is not less
21861,SECT. VII.,"unsatisfying than the falsehood damnatory. For now, with the lapse"
21862,SECT. VII.,"of time, we find a further depression of the moral standard. We have"
21863,SECT. VII.,"here, in its most absolute form, the deification of beauty[1054]; ὃ"
21864,SECT. VII.,"σεμνότατον, καὶ τιμιώτατον, καὶ θειότατον τῶν ὄντων ἔστιν[1055]. But it"
21865,SECT. VII.,is totally disjoined from purity. He does not warrant and support his
21866,SECT. VII.,"eulogy upon Helen, by recurring to the true Homeric representation of"
21867,SECT. VII.,"her; but he boldly declares the high value of sensual enjoyment[1056],"
21868,SECT. VII.,commends the ambition of Paris to acquire an unrivalled possession and
21869,SECT. VII.,"thereby a close affinity with the gods, and sees in the war only a"
21870,SECT. VII.,proof of the immense and just estimation in which both parties held so
21871,SECT. VII.,"great a treasure[1057], without the smallest scruple as to the means by"
21872,SECT. VII.,which it was to be acquired or held. From this picture we may pass on
21873,SECT. VII.,"to the Helen of Virgil, which represents the destructive process in its"
21874,SECT. VII.,"last stage of exaggeration, and leaves nothing more for the spirit of"
21875,SECT. VII.,havoc to devise.
21876,SECT. VII.,
21877,SECT. VII.,[1054] I do not remember to have seen the principles of Isocrates
21878,SECT. VII.,"rigorously applied in modern literature, excepting in the Adrienne de"

21887,SECT. VII.,"In Æn. i. 650, Helen is declared to have _sought_ Troy and unlawful"
21888,SECT. VII.,"nuptials, instead of having been carried off from home against her"
21889,SECT. VII.,"will. In Æn. vi. 513, she is represented as having made use of the"
21890,SECT. VII.,"religious orgies on the fatal night, to invite the Greeks into Troy;"
21891,SECT. VII.,"and, after first carefully removing all weapons for defence, she is"
21892,SECT. VII.,said to have opened the apartment of her sleeping husband Deiphobus
21893,SECT. VII.,"to Menelaus, in the hope that, by becoming accessory to a treacherous"
21894,SECT. VII.,"murder, she might disarm the resentment of one whom she had so deeply"
21895,SECT. VII.,wronged. But even this passage has probably done less towards occupying
21896,SECT. VII.,"the modern mind with the falsified idea of Helen, than one of most"
21897,SECT. VII.,extraordinary scenic grandeur in the second Æneid; where Æneas relates
21898,SECT. VII.,"how he saw her, the common curse of her own country and of Troy,"
21899,SECT. VII.,"crouching beside the altar of Vesta, amidst the lurid flames of the"
21900,SECT. VII.,"final conflagration, in order to escape the wrath of Menelaus."

21911,SECT. VII.,"that he was about to slay the woman who, according to himself, had"
21912,SECT. VII.,"lived for ten years as a friend among his friends; when, at the right"
21913,SECT. VII.,"moment, his mother Venus appeared, and reminded him that on the whole"

21919,SECT. VII.,"She is lost in sensuality, a traitress alike to Greece and to Troy,"
21920,SECT. VII.,willing to make miserable victims of others in the hope of purchasing
21921,SECT. VII.,"her own immunity: all her deep remorse and sorrow, all her tenderness"
21922,SECT. VII.,"and modesty, are blotted out from her character, and the void places in"
21923,SECT. VII.,"the picture are filled by the detestation, with which both Greeks and"
21924,SECT. VII.,"Trojans regarded, as indeed they might well regard, such a monster. But"
21925,SECT. VII.,let us pass on.
21926,SECT. VII.,
21927,SECT. VII.,~_Achilles and Ulysses._~
21928,SECT. VII.,
21929,SECT. VII.,"Among the many proofs of the vast scope of Homer’s mind, one of the"
21930,SECT. VII.,most remarkable is to be found in the twin characters of his prime
21931,SECT. VII.,heroes or protagonists. It seems as if he had taken a survey of human
21932,SECT. VII.,"nature in its utmost breadth and depth, and, finding that he had not"
21933,SECT. VII.,the means to establish a perfect equilibrium between its highest powers
21934,SECT. VII.,"when all in full development, had determined to represent them, with"
21935,SECT. VII.,"reference to the two great functions of intellect and passion, in two"
21936,SECT. VII.,"immortal figures. In each of the two, each of these elements has been"
21937,SECT. VII.,"represented with an extraordinary power, yet so, that the sovereignty"
21938,SECT. VII.,"should rest in Achilles as to the one, and in Ulysses as to the other."
21939,SECT. VII.,But the depth of emotion in Ulysses is greater than in any other male
21940,SECT. VII.,"character of the poems, except Achilles; only it is withdrawn from view"
21941,SECT. VII.,because so much under the mastery of his wisdom. And in like manner
21942,SECT. VII.,"on the other hand, a far greater power, directed to the purpose of"
21943,SECT. VII.,"self-command and self-repression, is shown us in Achilles than in any"
21944,SECT. VII.,"other character except Ulysses; but this also is under partial eclipse,"
21945,SECT. VII.,"because the injustice, ingratitude, scorn, and meanness which Agamemnon"
21946,SECT. VII.,"concentrates in the robbery of a beloved object from him, appeal so"
21947,SECT. VII.,irresistibly to the passionate side of his nature as to bring it out in
21948,SECT. VII.,overpowering proportions.
21949,SECT. VII.,
21950,SECT. VII.,"These being the leading ideas of the two characters, Homer has equipped"
21951,SECT. VII.,each of them with the apparatus of a full-furnished man; and in
21952,SECT. VII.,"apportioning to each his share of other qualities and accomplishments,"
21953,SECT. VII.,he has made such a distribution as on the whole would give the best
21954,SECT. VII.,balance and the most satisfactory general result. Thus it is plain that
21955,SECT. VII.,"the character of Achilles, covering as it did volcanic passions, was"
21956,SECT. VII.,"in danger of degenerating into phrensy. Homer has, therefore, assigned"
21957,SECT. VII.,"to him a peculiar refinement. His leisure is beguiled with song,"
21958,SECT. VII.,consecrated to the achievements of ancient heroes; he has the finest
21959,SECT. VII.,"tact, and is by far the greatest gentleman, of all the warriors of the"
21960,SECT. VII.,poems; even personal ornaments to set off his transcendent beauty[1058]
21961,SECT. VII.,"are not beneath his notice, a trait which would have been misplaced in"
21962,SECT. VII.,"Ulysses, ludicrous in Ajax, and which is in Paris contemptible, but"
21963,SECT. VII.,"which has its advantage in Achilles, because it is a simple accessory"
21964,SECT. VII.,"subordinate to greater matters, and because, so far as it goes, it"
21965,SECT. VII.,is a weight placed in the scale opposite to that which threatens to
21966,SECT. VII.,"preponderate, and to mar by the strong vein of violence the general"
21967,SECT. VII.,harmony of the character.
21968,SECT. VII.,
21969,SECT. VII.,[1058] Il. ii. 875.
21970,SECT. VII.,
21971,SECT. VII.,"In the same way, as Ulysses is distinguished by a never-failing"
21972,SECT. VII.,"presence of mind, forethought, and mastery over emotion, so the danger"
21973,SECT. VII.,for him lies on the side of an undue predominance of the calculating
21974,SECT. VII.,"element, which threatens to reduce him from the heroic standard to"
21975,SECT. VII.,"the low level of a vulgar utilitarianism. Here, as before, Homer has"
21976,SECT. VII.,been ready with his remedies. He exhibits to us this great prince and
21977,SECT. VII.,"statesman as bearing also a character of patriarchal simplicity, and"
21978,SECT. VII.,"makes him, the profoundest and most astute man of the world, represent"
21979,SECT. VII.,the very childhood of the human race in his readiness to ply the
21980,SECT. VII.,sickle or to drive the plough[1059]. Above all--and this is the prime
21981,SECT. VII.,safeguard of his character--he makes Ulysses a model for Greece of
21982,SECT. VII.,steady unvarying brightness in the domestic affections. The emotion of
21983,SECT. VII.,"Hector in the Sixth Iliad, and of Priam in the Twenty-fourth, are not"
21984,SECT. VII.,"capable of comparison with those of Ulysses, because theirs constitute"
21985,SECT. VII.,"the central points of the characters, and likewise are the products"
21986,SECT. VII.,"of great junctures of danger and affliction respectively, while his"
21987,SECT. VII.,exhibit and indeed compose a settled and standing bent of his soul.
21988,SECT. VII.,"He alone, of all the chieftains who were beneath the walls of Troy,"
21989,SECT. VII.,"is full of the near recollection of his son, his Telemachus[1060];"
21990,SECT. VII.,"his desire and ambition never pass indeed beyond barren Ithaca, and"
21991,SECT. VII.,his daily thought through long years of wandering and detention is
21992,SECT. VII.,"to return there[1061], to see the very smoke curling upward from its"
21993,SECT. VII.,"chimneys, so that the charms of a goddess are a pain to him, because"
21994,SECT. VII.,they keep him from Penelope[1062].

22006,SECT. VII.,"leading trait. But in vain. Achilles too, more slowly however than"
22007,SECT. VII.,"his rival, passed, with later authors, into the wild beast; Ulysses"
22008,SECT. VII.,descended at a leap into the mere shopman of politics and war; and it
22009,SECT. VII.,"is singular to see how, when once the basis of the character had been"
22010,SECT. VII.,"vulgarized, and the key to its movements lost, it came to be drawn in"
22011,SECT. VII.,attitudes the most opposed to even the broadest and most undeniable of

22015,SECT. VII.,
22016,SECT. VII.,"There is nothing in the political character of Ulysses more remarkable,"
22017,SECT. VII.,than his power of setting himself in sole action against a multitude;
22018,SECT. VII.,whether we take him in the government of his refractory crew during
22019,SECT. VII.,"his wanderings; or in the body of the Horse, when a sound would have"
22020,SECT. VII.,"ruined the enterprize of the Greeks, so that he had to lay his strong"
22021,SECT. VII.,hand over the jaws of the babbler Anticlus[1063]; or in the stern
22022,SECT. VII.,preliminaries to his final revenge upon the Suitors; or in his war with
22023,SECT. VII.,"his rebellious subjects; or, above all, in the desperate crisis of the"
22024,SECT. VII.,"Second Iliad, when by his fearless courage, decision, and activity he"
22025,SECT. VII.,"saves the Greek army from total and shameful failure. And yet, much as"
22026,SECT. VII.,"the Mahometans[1064] were railed at by the poets of Italy, indeed of"
22027,SECT. VII.,"England, in the character of image-worshippers, so Ulysses is held up"
22028,SECT. VII.,to scorn in Euripides as a mere waiter upon popular favour. Thus in the
22029,SECT. VII.,Hecuba he is

22032,SECT. VII.,
22033,SECT. VII.,[1064] In proof of the establishment of this curious usage in our

22042,SECT. VII.,astonishment at any other kind of misrepresentation. As when Hecuba
22043,SECT. VII.,"laments, in the Troades[1065], that her lot is to be the captive of the"
22044,SECT. VII.,"base, faithless, malignant, all-stinging maker of mischief. Such is the"
22045,SECT. VII.,"standing type of Ulysses in the after-tradition. Whenever anything bad,"
22046,SECT. VII.,"cruel, and above all mean, is to be done, he is the ever-ready, and"
22047,SECT. VII.,"indeed thoroughly Satanic, instrument."

22051,SECT. VII.,The Second Epistle of the First Book of Horace is full of interest with
22052,SECT. VII.,"reference to this subject, because in it he gives us the result of his"
22053,SECT. VII.,"recent re-perusal of the Homeric poems at Præneste. And, accordingly,"
22054,SECT. VII.,we find here a great improvement upon the Ulysses of the Greek drama.
22055,SECT. VII.,"He seems to have struck Horace at this time more forcibly, or more"
22056,SECT. VII.,"favourably, than any other Homeric character; for, after describing in"
22057,SECT. VII.,"strong terms what was amiss both within and without the walls of Troy,"
22058,SECT. VII.,he makes this transition[1066];

22067,SECT. VII.,"advantage of an impression fresh from the Homeric text, instead of"
22068,SECT. VII.,those drawn from the muddy source of the current traditions. It does
22069,SECT. VII.,"not diminish but enhances the compliment, when the acute but Epicurean"
22070,SECT. VII.,"writer goes on to intimate, in more than half-earnest, that these"
22071,SECT. VII.,"virtues of Ulysses were too high for imitation, and that he himself was"
22072,SECT. VII.,"content rather to emulate the suitors of Penelope, and the easy life of"
22073,SECT. VII.,the youths about Alcinous[1067].

22077,SECT. VII.,But if some small instalment of justice was thus done by Horace to

22079,SECT. VII.,"reproduce, without mitigation or relief, the worst features of the"
22080,SECT. VII.,worst form of the character. With him it is Ulysses who is chosen to
22081,SECT. VII.,"play the slayer of Palamedes and the betrayer of Sinon[1068], and to"
22082,SECT. VII.,"lead the party which, conducted by Helen, was to massacre Deiphobus in"
22083,SECT. VII.,"his chamber[1069]. On account of his fierce cruelty, even the ‘ground"
22084,SECT. VII.,is cursed for his sake;’ poor Ithaca is loaded with imprecations by
22085,SECT. VII.,"Æneas as he passes near it. Once he is called _infelix_, the greatest"
22086,SECT. VII.,compliment that he anywhere receives; but his name in few cases escapes
22087,SECT. VII.,"the affix of some abusive epithet, drawn alike from inhumanity or from"

22097,SECT. VII.,
22098,SECT. VII.,"The character of Achilles was more fortunate, in the handling it"
22099,SECT. VII.,"experienced from the Greek drama, than that of Ulysses. In the"
22100,SECT. VII.,"Iphigenia of Euripides, the hero of the Iliad appears as a faithful"
22101,SECT. VII.,"lover, and as a gallant and chivalrous warrior. At the same time, it"
22102,SECT. VII.,"has lost altogether the breadth of touch and largeness of scope, with"
22103,SECT. VII.,which it is drawn in Homer. We miss entirely that unfathomable power
22104,SECT. VII.,"of intellect, of passion, and also of bodily force, all combined in"
22105,SECT. VII.,"one figure, which carry the Achilles of Homer beyond every other human"
22106,SECT. VII.,"example in the quality of sheer grandeur, and make it touch the limits"
22107,SECT. VII.,of the superhuman. There is nothing said or done by the Achilles of
22108,SECT. VII.,"Euripides, nothing reported of him or assigned to him, no impression"
22109,SECT. VII.,"borne into a reader’s mind concerning him, which would not have been"
22110,SECT. VII.,"perfectly suitable to other warriors; for example, to the Diomed of"
22111,SECT. VII.,"Homer. He falls back into a class, and becomes a simple member of it,"
22112,SECT. VII.,"instead of being a creation paramount and alone; alone, like Olympus"
22113,SECT. VII.,"amidst the mountains of Greece; alone for ever in his sublimity, amidst"
22114,SECT. VII.,"the famous memories of other heroes, no less truly than he was alone in"
22115,SECT. VII.,his solitary encampment during the continuance of the Wrath.
22116,SECT. VII.,
22117,SECT. VII.,With Pindar Achilles appears in a different dress. He is here conceived
22118,SECT. VII.,"without mind, as a youth marvellous in strength, hardihood, and"
22119,SECT. VII.,"swiftness of foot, growing up into a mighty warrior[1071]. The Achilles"
22120,SECT. VII.,of Pindar is but as a pebble broken away from the mountain-mass of
22121,SECT. VII.,Homer.

22125,SECT. VII.,"Catullus, in his beautiful poem on the Nuptials of Peleus and Thetis,"
22126,SECT. VII.,had a rare opportunity of setting forth the glories of Achilles. And
22127,SECT. VII.,"he is in fact made the main subject of the nuptial song, properly so"
22128,SECT. VII.,"called; yet nothing of him is really celebrated by the poet[1072],"
22129,SECT. VII.,except his valour and his swiftness; all the rest is simple
22130,SECT. VII.,amplification and embellishment. It seems by this time to have been
22131,SECT. VII.,"wholly forgotten, that the Homeric Achilles had a soul."

22144,SECT. VII.,"surpassing his great ingenuity, put in _Homereum_."
22145,SECT. VII.,
22146,SECT. VII.,The character is exhibited here in a light at once feeble and
22147,SECT. VII.,"misleading, for its cardinal point is made to be the supremacy of"
22148,SECT. VII.,force over right. Now in Homer it is a sense that right has been
22149,SECT. VII.,"deeply violated, which serves for the very groundwork out of which his"
22150,SECT. VII.,exasperation rises. He does not view the question as one of _meum_ and
22151,SECT. VII.,"_tuum_ only, or even mainly. His eye is first upon the gross wrong"
22152,SECT. VII.,"done, and only then upon himself as the subject of it. He resists"
22153,SECT. VII.,"Agamemnon’s claim[1074] for a compensation at the very first, when it"
22154,SECT. VII.,"is urged, not against him, but against the Greeks at large[1075]; and"
22155,SECT. VII.,he bursts out into indignant vituperation of the greedy king before
22156,SECT. VII.,"Agamemnon has threatened to take Briseis, and when he has only insisted"
22157,SECT. VII.,"that, if the Greeks do not compensate him, he will then help himself to"
22158,SECT. VII.,the prize _either_ of Achilles or of Ajax or of Ulysses. In truth he
22159,SECT. VII.,"is the assertor of the supremacy of law over will, much more than of"
22160,SECT. VII.,force over law; and there is the greatest difference between pushing a
22161,SECT. VII.,"sound and true principle even to gross excess, and proceeding from the"
22162,SECT. VII.,"outset upon a false one. The former, not the latter, is the case of the"

22170,SECT. VII.,
22171,SECT. VII.,"The poet Statius observed, with sagacity enough, that the Achilles of"
22172,SECT. VII.,Homer was but a _torso_; that the Iliad had only allowed him to be
22173,SECT. VII.,"exhibited in one light, as it were, and at a single juncture of his"
22174,SECT. VII.,"career. So he resolved to profit by the ungotten mine, and to found"
22175,SECT. VII.,"a poem on the whole Achilles, child and man, in his rising, at his"
22176,SECT. VII.,"zenith, and in his setting blaze;"

22184,SECT. VII.,We are therefore perhaps entitled to expect from him a fuller and more
22185,SECT. VII.,"comprehensive grasp of the character than was usual, even although the"
22186,SECT. VII.,narrative is broken off. The five books which remain of this work do
22187,SECT. VII.,not bring him so far as to the plains of Troy; but we leave him on the
22188,SECT. VII.,"voyage from Scyros to Troas. They are chiefly occupied, therefore, with"
22189,SECT. VII.,"his residence there in the disguise of a maiden, and with the incidents"
22190,SECT. VII.,of his sojourn.
22191,SECT. VII.,
22192,SECT. VII.,"Now the story of Achilles at Scyros, and of his connexion with"
22193,SECT. VII.,"Deidamia, harmonizes with one side of his character as it is drawn in"
22194,SECT. VII.,Homer. It is evident that his personal beauty was not less graceful
22195,SECT. VII.,than manful; and he alone of the Greek chieftains is related to have
22196,SECT. VII.,worn ornaments of gold. Therefore that in the days of his boyhood
22197,SECT. VII.,"he should wear the dress of maidens, and pass for one of them, is"
22198,SECT. VII.,at any rate in accordance with a particular point of the Homeric
22199,SECT. VII.,"tradition, though little adequate to its lofty tone as a whole. But"
22200,SECT. VII.,this particular point is just what Statius contrives wholly to let
22201,SECT. VII.,"drop. He shows us Achilles like the sham Anne Page, in the Merry Wives"
22202,SECT. VII.,"of Windsor[1077], ‘as a great lubberly boy,’ neither careful nor able"
22203,SECT. VII.,"to give any grace to the movement of his limbs. For, in the dance, he"
22204,SECT. VII.,would break the heart of any rightminded master of the ceremonies:

22211,SECT. VII.,
22212,SECT. VII.,Nor does this writer appear at all to have apprehended the main
22213,SECT. VII.,"ideas of the Homeric character. In the Iliad, the education which"
22214,SECT. VII.,"Achilles receives is the ordinary education of men of his rank, and"
22215,SECT. VII.,"his transcendent powers in after-life are due to a just, yet no more"
22216,SECT. VII.,"than a just, development of his extraordinary original gifts. But in"
22217,SECT. VII.,Statius he is represented as having owed everything to the peculiar
22218,SECT. VII.,"training of Chiron; whose semiferine life he shared, so that his diet"
22219,SECT. VII.,"in childhood consisted of the raw entrails of lions, and the marrow of"
22220,SECT. VII.,"half-dead she-wolves! His mind, indeed, was not overlooked amidst these"
22221,SECT. VII.,"brutalities, for he exhausts a long catalogue of acquirements; but"
22222,SECT. VII.,"Statius, as might be expected, completely drops out of his political"
22223,SECT. VII.,"education what is its one grand element in Homer, namely, the art of"
22224,SECT. VII.,"government over man by speech. Instead of this, Chiron the Centaur"
22225,SECT. VII.,"merely teaches him those abstract rules of right, by which he had"
22226,SECT. VII.,himself been wont to govern Centaurs[1078].

22229,SECT. VII.,
22230,SECT. VII.,To the same age with the _Achilleis_ of Statius belongs the _Troades_
22231,SECT. VII.,"of Seneca. However this play may be criticized, as a study, like the"

22233,SECT. VII.,"betray the choice of Euripides for a model, it seems to be by some"
22234,SECT. VII.,"degrees better, in the conception and use of some famous Homeric"
22235,SECT. VII.,"characters, than any production since the time of Æschylus. The"
22236,SECT. VII.,"delineation of Andromache, if it has not ceased to be theatrical, is"
22237,SECT. VII.,"full at least of intense affection, all still centring in Hector."
22238,SECT. VII.,"Ulysses, though reviled by that matron in her passionate grief, at"
22239,SECT. VII.,least does the humane action of allowing her a little time to weep
22240,SECT. VII.,"before the sentence of Calchas is executed upon Astyanax, and shows"
22241,SECT. VII.,something too of the intellect of his antitype[1079]. Helen is
22242,SECT. VII.,"exhibited not as vicious, but as wanting in firmness of character. She"
22243,SECT. VII.,is driven by solicitation into the offence of alluring Polyxena to her
22244,SECT. VII.,"immolation, under the name of a bridal with Neoptolemus; commences the"
22245,SECT. VII.,"performance of this false part with self-reproach, and then, challenged"
22246,SECT. VII.,"by Andromache, quits it and avows the truth[1080]."

22252,SECT. VII.,But here we find a new form of departure from the ancient and genuine
22253,SECT. VII.,"tradition. The principal motive, assigned by Seneca to the Greeks"
22254,SECT. VII.,"for putting Astyanax to death, is a terrified recollection of his"
22255,SECT. VII.,"father Hector, and a dread lest, upon attaining to manhood, he should"
22256,SECT. VII.,"avenge his own country against Greece. Again, Andromache, as it were,"
22257,SECT. VII.,"intimidates Ulysses, by invoking the shade of her husband:"

22266,SECT. VII.,
22267,SECT. VII.,"During all the time, however, in which we moved among the Greeks and"
22268,SECT. VII.,"among the earlier Romans, the corrupting process acted only upon each"
22269,SECT. VII.,"of the Homeric creations by itself, and there was no cause at work,"
22270,SECT. VII.,which went to alter and pervert wholesale their collective relations to
22271,SECT. VII.,one another.

22273,SECT. VII.,~_New relative position of Trojans and Greeks._~
22274,SECT. VII.,
22275,SECT. VII.,"But from the period when the Æneid appeared, or at least so soon as"
22276,SECT. VII.,"it became the normal poem of the Roman literature, a new cause was"
22277,SECT. VII.,"in operation which, without mitigating in any degree the previous"
22278,SECT. VII.,"depraving agencies, introduced a new set of them, and began to disturb"
22279,SECT. VII.,"the positions of the two grand sets of characters, Greek and Trojan,"
22280,SECT. VII.,relatively to one another.
22281,SECT. VII.,
22282,SECT. VII.,Virgil had sought to give to the Cæsars the advantage of a hold upon
22283,SECT. VII.,royal antiquity by fabulous descent. He had before him the choice
22284,SECT. VII.,"between Greece and Troy, which alike and alone enjoyed a world-wide"
22285,SECT. VII.,honour. He could not hesitate which to select. The Greek histories were
22286,SECT. VII.,"too near and too well known. Besides, the Greek dynasties generally"
22287,SECT. VII.,had dwindled before they disappeared. The splendour of the Pelopids
22288,SECT. VII.,"in particular had been quenched in calamity and crime, and no other"
22289,SECT. VII.,of the Homeric lines had attained to greatness in political influence
22290,SECT. VII.,or historic fame. But the family of Priam had fallen gloriously in
22291,SECT. VII.,fighting for hearth and altar: it had disappeared from history in its
22292,SECT. VII.,"full renown, ‘_Magna_ mei sub terras ibat imago.’ Virgil chose too the"
22293,SECT. VII.,"house which was most ancient, and which traced link by link, as that of"
22294,SECT. VII.,"Agamemnon did not, a known and a named lineage up to Jupiter."
22295,SECT. VII.,
22296,SECT. VII.,"From this cause, both in the Æneid itself and afterwards, the Trojan"
22297,SECT. VII.,"characters were set upon stilts, and the Greeks were left to take their"
22298,SECT. VII.,"chance. Besides the loss of equilibrium, and the allowed predominance"
22299,SECT. VII.,"of coarser elements, which we have to lament in the Greek handling of"
22300,SECT. VII.,"them, we now see them pass, with the Romans, even into insignificance."
22301,SECT. VII.,"The Diomed of Arpi is a person wholly unmarked; and he, like all the"
22302,SECT. VII.,"rest of his countrymen, is treated by Virgil simply as an instrument"
22303,SECT. VII.,"for obtaining enhanced effect, in the interest that he endeavours to"
22304,SECT. VII.,concentrate on his Trojan characters; whereas the key to all Homer’s
22305,SECT. VII.,"dispositions in the Iliad is to be found in the recollection, that he"
22306,SECT. VII.,dealt with everything Trojan in the manner which was recommended and
22307,SECT. VII.,"required by his Greek nationality. From this time forward, we find the"
22308,SECT. VII.,palm both of valour and of wisdom clean carried over from the Greek
22309,SECT. VII.,"to the Trojan side: the heroes of Homer remain, like unhewn boulders"
22310,SECT. VII.,"on the plain, crude, gross, and reciprocally almost indistinguishable"
22311,SECT. VII.,masses of cunning or ferocity.
22312,SECT. VII.,
22313,SECT. VII.,"Virgil gave the tone in this respect, not only to the literature of"
22314,SECT. VII.,"ancient Rome, but to that of Christian Italy. For this reason, we may"
22315,SECT. VII.,"presume, among others, Orlando, the prime hero of the Italian romance,"
22316,SECT. VII.,"is, as I have before observed, modelled upon Hector. He is in many"
22317,SECT. VII.,"respects a very grand conception. Pulci, in describing his death, rises"
22318,SECT. VII.,even to the sublime when he says there is
22319,SECT. VII.,
22320,SECT. VII.,"‘Un Dio, ed una Fede, ed uno Orlando.’"
22321,SECT. VII.,
22322,SECT. VII.,"Which we may render in prose ‘One God, one way to God, one true type"
22323,SECT. VII.,"of manhood.’ Still it is remarkable that in Bojardo, as well as in"
22324,SECT. VII.,"Ariosto, the purer traces of the Homeric arrangement thus far at"
22325,SECT. VII.,"least remain, that Orlando, although he is the type of the Christian"
22326,SECT. VII.,"chivalry, yet, as he resembles Hector in piety and virtue, so likewise"
22327,SECT. VII.,"retains his likeness in this respect, that he is not the most"
22328,SECT. VII.,"formidable or valiant warrior of the poems. In Ariosto particularly,"
22329,SECT. VII.,"he is made inferior to Mandricardo, to Rodomonte, and most of all, but"
22330,SECT. VII.,"this for personal and prudential reasons, to Ruggiero. These three"
22331,SECT. VII.,"perhaps may be considered as being respectively the Ajax, the Diomed,"
22332,SECT. VII.,and the Achilles of the _Orlando Furioso_.
22333,SECT. VII.,
22334,SECT. VII.,"And now the fancy for derivation from a Trojan stock, of which Virgil"
22335,SECT. VII.,"had set the fashion, was fully developed. Ariosto, at great length and"
22336,SECT. VII.,"in the most formal manner, establishes this lineage for his patrons,"
22337,SECT. VII.,the family of Este. Others followed him. The humour passed even beyond
22338,SECT. VII.,"the limits of Italy, into these then remote isles. A Trojan origin"
22339,SECT. VII.,"was ascribed to the English nation, and the authority of Homer, as to"
22340,SECT. VII.,"characters and history, was openly renounced by Dryden."

22358,SECT. VII.,~_The Imitations by Tasso._~
22359,SECT. VII.,
22360,SECT. VII.,"Throughout the ‘Jerusalem’ of Tasso, we find imitations which are"
22361,SECT. VII.,invested with greater interest than the remote copies commonly
22362,SECT. VII.,"in circulation, because, from the large infusion of many leading"
22363,SECT. VII.,"arrangements, copied from Homer, into the plot of the poem, we may"
22364,SECT. VII.,conclude with reason that they were in all likelihood drawn immediately
22365,SECT. VII.,"from the original. Some of these personages, too, are in so far closely"
22366,SECT. VII.,"imitated from Homer, that Tasso has spent little or nothing of his own"
22367,SECT. VII.,"upon them, but has simply equipped them with as much of the Homeric"
22368,SECT. VII.,idea as he thought available.
22369,SECT. VII.,
22370,SECT. VII.,"The most successful among them is Godfrey, modelled, but also perhaps"
22371,SECT. VII.,"improved, upon Agamemnon, who is by no means in my view one of the"
22372,SECT. VII.,"greater characters of the Iliad, though he has been incautiously called"
22373,SECT. VII.,"by Mitford ‘ambitious, active, brave, generous, and humane[1083].’"
22374,SECT. VII.,Agamemnon has indeed that primary and fundamental qualification for
22375,SECT. VII.,"his office, the political spirit, so to term it, and the sense of"
22376,SECT. VII.,"responsibility, which are so well developed in Godfrey; but it is"
22377,SECT. VII.,"doubtful whether he is entitled to be called either thoroughly brave,"
22378,SECT. VII.,or at all generous or humane. Agamemnon’s character is admirably
22379,SECT. VII.,adapted to its place and purpose in the Iliad; in any more general
22380,SECT. VII.,"view, Godfrey’s both stands higher in the moral sphere, and perhaps"
22381,SECT. VII.,forms by itself a better poetic whole.

22389,SECT. VII.,attempt to reproduce both Achilles and Ulysses under the names of
22390,SECT. VII.,"Argante and Alete, who appear as envoys from the Sultan of Egypt to the"
22391,SECT. VII.,"Frankish camp. For the benefit of the former, Tasso has translated the"
22392,SECT. VII.,"two lines that describe Achilles in Horace, and has added a spice of"
22393,SECT. VII.,the Virgilian Mezentius:
22394,SECT. VII.,
22395,SECT. VII.,"Impaziente, inesorabil, fero,"
22396,SECT. VII.,"Nell’ arme infaticabil ed invitto,"
22397,SECT. VII.,"D’ ogni Dio sprezzatore, e chi ripone"
22398,SECT. VII.,Nella spada sua legge e sua ragione[1084].
22399,SECT. VII.,
22400,SECT. VII.,[1084] Gerus. ii. 59.
22401,SECT. VII.,
22402,SECT. VII.,"Accordingly, Argante proves to be the prime warrior on the Pagan side,"
22403,SECT. VII.,"and his character, described in these lines, is consistently carried"
22404,SECT. VII.,through.
22405,SECT. VII.,
22406,SECT. VII.,"It is perhaps not to be regretted, that Tasso has left on record no"
22407,SECT. VII.,other mark that Achilles was in his mind; for it is only the most
22408,SECT. VII.,debased edition of Achilles to whom Argante bears the slightest
22409,SECT. VII.,"resemblance. The same is the case with Alete. Of humble origin, he"
22410,SECT. VII.,"rises to high honours by his powers of invention and of speech, and by"
22411,SECT. VII.,"the pliability of his character. Prompt in fiction, adroit in laying"
22412,SECT. VII.,"snares, a master of the disguised calumnies ‘_che sono accuse, e pajon"
22413,SECT. VII.,"lodi_[1085],’ he evidently recalls the caricatures, which for two"
22414,SECT. VII.,thousand years had circulated under the name of the Homeric Ulysses.
22415,SECT. VII.,"Thus Tasso’s acquaintance with the text, whatever it may have been,"
22416,SECT. VII.,"did not avail to open his eyes, darkened by corrupt tradition, or to"
22417,SECT. VII.,bring him nearer to the truth as regarded those sovereign creations of
22418,SECT. VII.,"the genius of Homer. So sure it is, both in this and in other matters,"
22419,SECT. VII.,that when long-established falsehoods have had habitual and undisturbed
22420,SECT. VII.,"possession of the public mind, they form an atmosphere which we inhale"
22421,SECT. VII.,long before consciousness begins. Hence the spurious colours with which
22422,SECT. VII.,"we have thus been surreptitiously imbued, long survive the power,"
22423,SECT. VII.,"or even the act, of recurrence to the original standards. For that"
22424,SECT. VII.,recurrence rarely takes place with such a concentration of the mind as
22425,SECT. VII.,"is necessary in order to the double process, first, of disentangling"
22426,SECT. VII.,"itself from the snares of a false conception, and secondly, of building"
22427,SECT. VII.,"up for itself, and this too from the very ground, a true one."

22432,SECT. VII.,
22433,SECT. VII.,"In the Troilus and Cressida, of which Shakespeare had at least a share,"
22434,SECT. VII.,"we see, perhaps, one of the lowest and latest pictures of mere mediæval"
22435,SECT. VII.,Homerism. The sun of the ancient criticism had set; that of the modern
22436,SECT. VII.,"had not risen. It must be admitted that, in this play, although it"
22437,SECT. VII.,"shows the clear handiwork of Shakespeare in some splendid passages,"
22438,SECT. VII.,"and much of beautiful and of characteristic diction, we scarcely"
22439,SECT. VII.,find one single living trait of the father of all bards preserved.
22440,SECT. VII.,"Our incomparable dramatist, by no fault of his own, came in at the"
22441,SECT. VII.,"very end of that depraved lineage of copyists, for which progressive"
22442,SECT. VII.,"degeneracy is the necessary law. As is said[1086], he followed Lydgate;"
22443,SECT. VII.,"Lydgate drew from a Guido of Messina, who in the thirteenth century"
22444,SECT. VII.,founded himself on Dictys Cretensis and Dares Phrygius.

22447,SECT. VII.,
22448,SECT. VII.,"Before his time Chaucer, we may presume, had drawn from the same"
22449,SECT. VII.,sources. Yet his poem of ‘Troilus and Cressida’ bears a token of the
22450,SECT. VII.,familiarity of the English mind with free institutions under the
22451,SECT. VII.,"Plantagenets. The fidelity with which traditions are preserved, and"
22452,SECT. VII.,"also the facility with which they are revived, no doubt often depends"
22453,SECT. VII.,"more upon moral sympathies, than upon any cause operating simply"
22454,SECT. VII.,"through the intellect of man. Though dealing with un-Homeric persons,"
22455,SECT. VII.,"or events, or both, and copying again from copies probably very"
22456,SECT. VII.,"corrupt, yet Chaucer, as an Englishman accustomed to English ideas of"
22457,SECT. VII.,"government, brings out with much more freshness and freedom the notion"
22458,SECT. VII.,"of public deliberation in Troy, (nay, even the very word parliament is"
22459,SECT. VII.,"not wanting,) than do the poets of the literary age of Greece."

22472,SECT. VII.,
22473,SECT. VII.,Thersites is converted into the modern fool. Diomed struts upon his
22474,SECT. VII.,"toes, while in Homer his modesty among the Greeks is the peculiar"
22475,SECT. VII.,"ornament of his valour. Ajax, whom Homer has made lumpish and"
22476,SECT. VII.,"goodnatured, is full of haughty follies, the coxcomb of warriors; while"
22477,SECT. VII.,"the mere bulk which, combined with bravery and bluntness, formed his"
22478,SECT. VII.,"peculiar note, is made the distinctive characteristic of Achilles. It"
22479,SECT. VII.,is still more grievous to find the relation of this hero to Patroclus
22480,SECT. VII.,"degraded by foul insinuations, entirely foreign to the Iliad, to its"
22481,SECT. VII.,"author, and even to its age. Agamemnon is a mere stage king; and"
22482,SECT. VII.,"it can be no wonder that Nestor’s character, which requires a fine"
22483,SECT. VII.,"appreciation from its gently rounded construction, should have become"
22484,SECT. VII.,"thoroughly commonplace and vapid. The same lot befalls Ulysses, who is"
22485,SECT. VII.,"made to play quite a secondary part. Paris, without any mending of his"
22486,SECT. VII.,"moral qualities, is allowed to present a much more respectable figure:"
22487,SECT. VII.,"the Helen of Homer reproaches his cowardice; but here he says, ‘I"
22488,SECT. VII.,"would fain have armed to-day, but my Nell would not have it so[1088].’"
22489,SECT. VII.,"She appears as the mere adulteress; and those, who remember how she"
22490,SECT. VII.,"is treated in Homer, will be able to measure the declension that time"
22491,SECT. VII.,"and unskilled hands had wrought, when they read the speech of Diomed"
22492,SECT. VII.,describing her as follows:

22507,SECT. VII.,"that Achilles only slays him by means of the swords of his Myrmidons,"
22508,SECT. VII.,"not by his own proper might; and that, too, does not happen"
22509,SECT. VII.,"until, wearied and disarmed, he applies to Achilles to forego his"
22510,SECT. VII.,"vantage[1090]: so that Ajax says with very great propriety indeed,"

22518,SECT. VII.,"Shirley’s ‘Contention of Ajax and Ulysses,’ independently of other"
22519,SECT. VII.,"merits, deserves notice for a partial return towards just conception"
22520,SECT. VII.,of the Homeric characters. Yet even here the claim of Ajax to the arms
22521,SECT. VII.,of Achilles is founded principally on the impeachment of Ulysses as a
22522,SECT. VII.,coward; and the reply of that chieftain rests much too exclusively on
22523,SECT. VII.,"setting up his political merits and achievements, as if he were strong"
22524,SECT. VII.,in no other title.
22525,SECT. VII.,
22526,SECT. VII.,The description of Ajax may deserve to be quoted:
22527,SECT. VII.,

22529,SECT. VII.,I may compare him to some spacious building;
22530,SECT. VII.,"His body holds vast rooms of entertainment,"
22531,SECT. VII.,And lower parts maintain the offices;
22532,SECT. VII.,"Only the garret, his exalted head,"
22533,SECT. VII.,"Useless for wise receipt, is fill’d with lumber."
22534,SECT. VII.,
22535,SECT. VII.,Dryden followed Shakespeare in the portion of this field which he had
22536,SECT. VII.,selected; and cast afresh the subject of Troilus and Cressida. He
22537,SECT. VII.,departed alike from Shakespeare and from Chaucer by making Cressida
22538,SECT. VII.,"prove innocent, a supposition, says Scott, no more endurable in the"
22539,SECT. VII.,"preceding age, than one ‘which should have exhibited Helen chaste, or"
22540,SECT. VII.,Hector a coward.’ All the incongruities of Shakespeare’s play are here
22541,SECT. VII.,"reproduced, including the mixture of the modern element of love with"
22542,SECT. VII.,the Greek and Trojan chivalry; Ajax and Achilles are depressed to one
22543,SECT. VII.,and the same low level.

22551,SECT. VII.,"slays Diomed in single combat, and is then himself slain by Achilles in"

22558,SECT. VII.,
22559,SECT. VII.,"A short time before this play of Dryden’s, Racine had taken the"
22560,SECT. VII.,"characters of the Trojan war in hand. His ‘Andromaque’ and ‘Iphigénie,’"
22561,SECT. VII.,"however, afford us no new lights, and might very well have been"
22562,SECT. VII.,"conceived by a person who had never read a line of Homer, though in"
22563,SECT. VII.,various passages there are imitations which must have filtered from
22564,SECT. VII.,the Homeric text. He was content in general to copy the traditions as
22565,SECT. VII.,given by Euripides; and it may provoke a smile to read an apology of
22566,SECT. VII.,"one of his editors, Boisjermain, for the manner in which Ulysses is"
22567,SECT. VII.,"handled in the ‘Iphigénie.’ Appearing, near the outset of the piece, as"
22568,SECT. VII.,"a personage of very high importance, he notwithstanding plays in the"
22569,SECT. VII.,"plot a part wholly insignificant, instead of assuming, as he does in"
22570,SECT. VII.,"Euripides, the important function of urging the slaughter of Iphigenia"
22571,SECT. VII.,for the honour and benefit of Greece. Speaking of the critics who
22572,SECT. VII.,"blame this arrangement, the editor says, they have failed to observe"
22573,SECT. VII.,that Racine has adopted the jealousy and intrigues of Hermione as the
22574,SECT. VII.,"prime movers against Iphigenia, and that these produce the same result"
22575,SECT. VII.,as might otherwise (forsooth) have been brought about by the reasonings
22576,SECT. VII.,of Ulysses. The work of literary profanation could hardly be carried
22577,SECT. VII.,further: it was not to be thus capriciously bandied about from pillar
22578,SECT. VII.,"to post, that Homer constructed his deathless masterpieces. In the"
22579,SECT. VII.,"‘Andromaque,’ much as it is praised, we miss, still more egregiously"
22580,SECT. VII.,"than in the ‘Iphigénie,’ all the simplicity and grandeur of the Greek"
22581,SECT. VII.,"heroic age, and find ourselves environed by the infinite littleness of"
22582,SECT. VII.,"merely passionate personal intrigues, which have self only for their"
22583,SECT. VII.,pole and centre. Nothing can be more unsatisfactory than to see these
22584,SECT. VII.,"archaic Grecian characters dressed in the very last Parisian fashions,"
22585,SECT. VII.,with speech and action accordingly. The total want of breadth and
22586,SECT. VII.,"depth of character, and of earnestness and resolution, as opposed to"
22587,SECT. VII.,"mere violence, is such that at parts of the ‘Andromaque’ we are almost"
22588,SECT. VII.,"compelled to ask, whether we are reading a tragedy or a burlesque? As,"
22589,SECT. VII.,"for instance, when, with the Sixth Iliad yet lingering upon our mental"
22590,SECT. VII.,"vision, we hear Andromache say to her confidante,"
22591,SECT. VII.,
22592,SECT. VII.,Tu vois le pouvoir de mes yeux[1094];

22594,SECT. VII.,[1094] Acte iii. sc. 5.

22597,SECT. VII.,"respect to Pyrrhus,"

22602,SECT. VII.,
22603,SECT. VII.,"It is here, too, that we see carried perhaps to the very highest"
22604,SECT. VII.,point of exaggeration the misstatement of the relative martial merits
22605,SECT. VII.,"and performances of Hector and his adversaries. The Greeks Hermione,"
22606,SECT. VII.,"herself a Spartan, describes as"

22615,SECT. VII.,
22616,SECT. VII.,It was well that the handling of Homer should cease altogether for
22617,SECT. VII.,"a time, when the characters and scenes belonging to his subject had"
22618,SECT. VII.,"become so thoroughly anti-Homeric, that they only falsified what"
22619,SECT. VII.,"they ought to have assisted to perpetuate. An interval has followed,"
22620,SECT. VII.,during which they have been allowed to repose. It would be hazardous
22621,SECT. VII.,"to conjecture, after the failures of so many ages, how far they"
22622,SECT. VII.,can hereafter be satisfactorily reproduced. It has been reserved
22623,SECT. VII.,"for Goethe, with his vigorous grasp of classical antiquity, to"
22624,SECT. VII.,tread regions bordering upon that of the Iliad and Odyssey with the
22625,SECT. VII.,"consciousness of a master’s power. In his ‘Iphigenie,’ for example, he"
22626,SECT. VII.,"has given to his scenes, events, and characters the tone and colouring,"
22627,SECT. VII.,"with which alone they ought to be invested. And, if the study and"
22628,SECT. VII.,investigation of Homer shall henceforward be carried on with a zeal
22629,SECT. VII.,"at all proportioned to the advantages of the present age, they cannot"
22630,SECT. VII.,"fail to accumulate materials, which it may be permitted us to hope that"
22631,SECT. VII.,"future genius will mould into such forms as, if only they are faithful"
22632,SECT. VII.,"to the spirit of their original, must alike abound in beauty, truth,"

22640,SECT. VII.,"We have now walked, in the train and in the light of the great Poet"
22641,SECT. VII.,"of antiquity, through a long, yet, so far at least as he is a party,"
22642,SECT. VII.,"not a barren circuit. We have begun with his earliest legends, faintly"
22643,SECT. VII.,glimmering upon us from the distance of an hundred generations. We have
22644,SECT. VII.,"seen the creations of his mind live and move, breathe and almost burn"
22645,SECT. VII.,"before us, under the power and magic of his art. We have found him"
22646,SECT. VII.,"to have shaped a great and noble mould of humanity, separate indeed"
22647,SECT. VII.,"from our experience, but allied through a thousand channels with our"
22648,SECT. VII.,sympathies. We have seen the greatness of our race at one and the same
22649,SECT. VII.,"time adorned with the simplicity of its childhood, and built up in"
22650,SECT. VII.,the strength of its maturity. We have seen it unfold itself in the
22651,SECT. VII.,"relations of society and sex, in peace and in war, in things human"
22652,SECT. VII.,and things divine; and have examined it under the varied lights of
22653,SECT. VII.,"comparison and contrast. We have seen how the memory of that great age,"
22654,SECT. VII.,"and of its yet greater Poet, has been cherished: how the trust which he"
22655,SECT. VII.,"bequeathed to mankind has been acknowledged, and yet how imperfectly it"
22656,SECT. VII.,has been discharged. We have striven to trace the fate of some among
22657,SECT. VII.,his greatest creations; and having accompanied them down the stream of
22658,SECT. VII.,"years even to our own day, it is full time to part. Nemesis must not"
