95,INTRODUCTION,"Professor Elizabeth Story Donno, in her recent =Elizabethan Minor Epics="
96,INTRODUCTION,"(New York, 1963), has made an important contribution to both"
97,INTRODUCTION,scholarship and teaching. Not only has she brought together for the
98,INTRODUCTION,"first time in one volume most of the extant Elizabethan minor epics,"
99,INTRODUCTION,"but in so doing, she has hastened the recognition that the minor epic,"
100,INTRODUCTION,"or ""epyllion"" as it has often been called in modern times,[1] is a"
101,INTRODUCTION,"distinctive literary genre as deserving of study as the sonnet, the"
102,INTRODUCTION,"pastoral, or the verse satire."
103,INTRODUCTION,
104,INTRODUCTION,The purpose of the present volume is to supplement and complement
105,INTRODUCTION,Professor Donno's collection by making available in facsimile seven
106,INTRODUCTION,minor epics of the English Renaissance omitted from it. With the
107,INTRODUCTION,"publication of these poems all the known, surviving minor epics of the"
108,INTRODUCTION,Elizabethan and Jacobean periods will for the first time be made
109,INTRODUCTION,available for study in faithful reproductions of the earliest extant
110,INTRODUCTION,editions.
111,INTRODUCTION,
112,INTRODUCTION,"Of the seven minor epics included here, three--=A Pleasant and"
113,INTRODUCTION,"Delightfull Poeme of Two Lovers, Philos and Licia=, =STC= 19886 (1624);"
114,INTRODUCTION,"Dunstan Gale's =Pyramus and Thisbe=, =STC= 11527 (1617); and S[amuel]"
115,INTRODUCTION,P[age's] =The Love of Amos and Laura= (1613)[2]--have not previously
116,INTRODUCTION,"been reprinted in modern times. And of these three, one, =Philos and"
117,INTRODUCTION,"Licia=, though listed in the =Short-Title Catalogue=, seems not to have"
118,INTRODUCTION,"been noticed by Renaissance scholars, nor even by any of the principal"
119,INTRODUCTION,"bibliographers except William C. Hazlitt, who gives this unique copy"
120,INTRODUCTION,bare mention as a book from Robert Burton's collection.[3]
121,INTRODUCTION,
122,INTRODUCTION,The remaining four books--R[ichard] L[ynche's][4] =The Amorous Poeme of
123,INTRODUCTION,"Dom Diego and Ginevra= published with Lynche's =Diella, Certaine"
124,INTRODUCTION,"Sonnets=, =STC= 17091 (1596); William Barksted's =Mirrha The Mother of"
125,INTRODUCTION,"Adonis: Or, Lustes Prodegies=, =STC= 1429 (1607), published with =Three"
126,INTRODUCTION,"Eglogs= by Lewes Machin; Barksted's =Hiren: or The Faire Greeke=, =STC="
127,INTRODUCTION,"1428 (1611); and H. A's =The Scourge of Venus, or, The Wanton Lady."
128,INTRODUCTION,"With the Rare Birth of Adonis=, =STC= 968 (1613)--have been edited by the"
129,INTRODUCTION,"""indefatigable"" Alexander B. Grosart in =Occasional Issues of Very Rare"
130,INTRODUCTION,"Books= (Manchester, 1876-77), limited to 50 copies each and hence"
131,INTRODUCTION,extremely scarce today.[5] =Dom Diego and Ginevra= was also reprinted by
132,INTRODUCTION,"Edward Arber in =An English Garner=, VII (Birmingham, 1883), 209-240."
133,INTRODUCTION,"With the exception of =Philos and Licia=, these poems are printed in"
134,INTRODUCTION,their approximate order of composition from 1596 to 1613.[6]

138,AUTHORSHIP,
139,AUTHORSHIP,"As befits the paucity of their known literary productions, the authors"
140,AUTHORSHIP,"of these poems have in common chiefly their anonymity, or a degree of"
141,AUTHORSHIP,obscurity approaching it. The authors of =Philos and Licia= and of H.
142,AUTHORSHIP,A's =The Scourge= are unknown. Though the authors of the other poems are
143,AUTHORSHIP,"known, little is known about them. The mystery of the authorship of"
144,AUTHORSHIP,=The Scourge= was compounded in the nineteenth century by its incorrect
145,AUTHORSHIP,"attribution to one Henry Austin. Grosart, for example, argued that the"
146,AUTHORSHIP,"H. A. on the title page and on the address ""To the Reader"" of the 1614"
147,AUTHORSHIP,"impression, and the A. H. on the corresponding pages of the 1620"
148,AUTHORSHIP,"impression, =STC= 970, was the Austin denounced by Thomas Heywood for"
149,AUTHORSHIP,stealing his translations of Ovid's =Ars Amatoria= and =De Remedio
150,AUTHORSHIP,"Amoris=. Arthur Melville Clark, in correcting this error, pointed out"
151,AUTHORSHIP,that these stolen translations of Ovid should not be confused with =The
152,AUTHORSHIP,"Scourge=, an original poetic composition based on Book X of a quite"
153,AUTHORSHIP,"different work by Ovid, =The Metamorphoses=. Clark concluded that ""H. A."
154,AUTHORSHIP,"or A. H. was probably the editor, not the author, although he may have"
155,AUTHORSHIP,"made certain corrections and additions, as the title-page of the"
156,AUTHORSHIP,"second edition states.""[7]"
157,AUTHORSHIP,
158,AUTHORSHIP,"However, H. A.--not A. H.--was almost certainly the author of =The"
159,AUTHORSHIP,"Scourge=, as evidenced, among other details, by the title page of the"
160,AUTHORSHIP,"1613 =Scourge=,[8] unknown to Clark, which unequivocally states:"
161,AUTHORSHIP,"""Written by =H. A.="" As to the initials H. A. appended to the address"
162,AUTHORSHIP,"""To the Reader"" of the 1614 impression and the A. H. on the title and"
163,AUTHORSHIP,"address pages of the 1620 impression, they were probably printer's"
164,AUTHORSHIP,"errors, arising in the 1614 impression from the printer's careless"
165,AUTHORSHIP,"assumption that the address ""To the Reader"" was the work of the author"
166,AUTHORSHIP,"rather than the bookseller, and in the impression of 1620 from a"
167,AUTHORSHIP,simple typographical metathesis of the letters H and A.[9]
168,AUTHORSHIP,
169,AUTHORSHIP,"The authorship of the remaining five poems, together with such"
170,AUTHORSHIP,"relevant facts of the authors' lives as are known, is as follows."
171,AUTHORSHIP,"=Pyramus and Thisbe= is by one Dunstan Gale (fl. 1596), about whom"
172,AUTHORSHIP,nothing else is known. =Dom Diego and Ginevra= has long been attributed
173,AUTHORSHIP,"to Richard Lynche (fl. 1601), otherwise chiefly known for his =Diella=,"
174,AUTHORSHIP,"a conventional sonnet sequence accompanying =Dom Diego=, and for his"
175,AUTHORSHIP,"translation of Cartari's =Le Imagini=, Englished as =The Fountaine of"
176,AUTHORSHIP,Ancient Fiction= (1599). =Mirrha= and =Hiren= are by William Barksted (fl.
177,AUTHORSHIP,"1611), ""one of the servants of his Majesties Revels,"" as the title"
178,AUTHORSHIP,page of =Hiren= proclaims. Barksted is believed to have completed =The
179,AUTHORSHIP,Insatiate Countess= after Marston's withdrawal from the stage in 1608
180,AUTHORSHIP,"or 1609. This play, bearing Barksted's name in one issue of the 1631"
181,AUTHORSHIP,"edition, contains a number of lines and phrases identical with lines"
182,AUTHORSHIP,and phrases in =Mirrha= and =Hiren=.[10]
183,AUTHORSHIP,
184,AUTHORSHIP,"=Amos and Laura= has been attributed, probably correctly, to Samuel"
185,AUTHORSHIP,"Page (1574-1630),[11] who is mentioned by Meres as ""most passionate"
186,AUTHORSHIP,"among us to bewaile and bemoane the perplexities of Love,""[12] and by"
187,AUTHORSHIP,his fellow-Oxonian Anthony à Wood as long-time Vicar of Deptford.[13]
188,AUTHORSHIP,"Although a few additional facts are known about these authors, none"
189,AUTHORSHIP,"seems to contribute to an understanding of the poems reprinted, and"
190,AUTHORSHIP,all may be found under the appropriate authors' names in the =DNB=.

194,SOURCES,
195,SOURCES,Traditionally the storyhouse of minor epic source materials has been
196,SOURCES,"classical mythology, but inevitably, as suitable classical myths were"
197,SOURCES,"exhausted, Renaissance poets turned to such sources as the Italian"
198,SOURCES,"novella, or even--romantic heresy--to comparatively free invention. As"
199,SOURCES,"if to compensate for these departures from orthodoxy, the later"
200,SOURCES,epyllionists leaned ever more heavily on allusions to classical
201,SOURCES,mythology. Of the seven poems included here only three (=Pyramus and
202,SOURCES,"Thisbe, Mirrha, and The Scourge=) are based on a classical source"
203,SOURCES,"(Ovid's =Metamorphoses=). Of the remaining four tales, two are drawn"
204,SOURCES,"from Bandello apparently by way of Painter, and the last two (=Philos"
205,SOURCES,"and Licia, Amos and Laura=), though greatly indebted to =Hero and"
206,SOURCES,"Leander= overall, seem not to have drawn their characters or actions"
207,SOURCES,directly from either a classical or more contemporary source. These
208,SOURCES,"last two poems, then, from a Renaissance point of view, are"
209,SOURCES,"comparatively free inventions. But both, and especially =Philos and"
210,SOURCES,"Licia=, are a tissue of allusions to classical mythology."
211,SOURCES,
212,SOURCES,Gale in =Pyramus and Thisbe= expands Golding's translation of Ovid's
213,SOURCES,"=Metamorphoses=, IV, from some 130 to 480 lines, Barksted expands less"
214,SOURCES,"than 300 lines of Golding's =Ovid=, X, to nearly 900, and H. A. enlarges"
215,SOURCES,"the same tale to about 950 lines.[14] It should be emphasized,"
216,SOURCES,"however, that these are not mere amplified translations, but"
217,SOURCES,"reworkings of the classics, with significant departures from them."
218,SOURCES,"Gale, for example, prefaces the romance of Pyramus and Thisbe with"
219,SOURCES,"their innocent meeting out-of-doors in an arbor, amid violets and"
220,SOURCES,"damask roses. He has Venus, enraged at seeing these youngsters"
221,SOURCES,"engaging in child-like rather than erotic play, command Cupid to shoot"
222,SOURCES,"his arrows at them ""As nought but death, their love-dart may remove"""
223,SOURCES,(Stanza 8). There is no counterpart to this opening scene in Golding's
224,SOURCES,Ovid.
225,SOURCES,
226,SOURCES,Similarly Barksted departs at length from Ovid in the beginning of his
227,SOURCES,"tale, where the Renaissance poet undertakes to explain why Mirrha is"
228,SOURCES,"cursed with love for her father. While she listens to the sweet, sad"
229,SOURCES,"songs of Orpheus, Cupid,[15] falling in love with her, courts her and"
230,SOURCES,"is rejected; his parting kiss ""did inspire/her brest with an infernall"
231,SOURCES,"and unnam'd desire"" (p. 123). Golding's Ovid, specifically denying"
232,SOURCES,"that Cupid had anything to do with Mirrha's unnatural love, suggests"
233,SOURCES,that Cinyras' daughter must have been blasted by one of the
234,SOURCES,Furies.[16] Other inventions of Barksted include a picture of her
235,SOURCES,"father with which Mirrha converses (pp. 126-127), pictures of her"
236,SOURCES,"suitors (p. 128), a picture of her mother, over which she throws a"
237,SOURCES,veil (p. 128) and a description of Mirrha herself (pp. 131-132). Later
238,SOURCES,"in the story Mirrha meets a satyr named Poplar (unknown to Ovid), who"
239,SOURCES,makes free with her (pp. 148-155). As punishment for such goings on in
240,SOURCES,"Diana's sacred grove, he is to be metamorphosed into the tree that now"
241,SOURCES,bears his name (even as Mirrha is subsequently transformed into the
242,SOURCES,tree that produces myrrh).
243,SOURCES,
244,SOURCES,"=The Scourge of Venus=, though following Ovid's story more closely than"
245,SOURCES,"=Mirrha=, expands Golding by more than 600 lines, to a little more than"
246,SOURCES,"the average length of the Elizabethan minor epic. In the process,"
247,SOURCES,"Mirrha is assigned lustful dreams not found in Ovid (p. 246), and is"
248,SOURCES,impelled to write a long letter to her father (pp. 247-250). Shortly
249,SOURCES,"thereafter, the author introduces an emphatically Christian digression"
250,SOURCES,"on the horror of Mirrha's ""fowle incestious lust"" and on the"
251,SOURCES,"importance of reading =""Gods holy Bible""= as a salve for sin (p. 253),"
252,SOURCES,"and invents the Nurse's prolix arguments against such ""filthy"" love as"
253,SOURCES,Mirrha desires (pp. 258-261).[17] The fact that the author follows
254,SOURCES,Ovid's story as closely as he does should be taken as a commentary on
255,SOURCES,his limited powers of invention rather than on his devotion to the art
256,SOURCES,of translation.
257,SOURCES,
258,SOURCES,"Bandello, I, 27, Belleforest, 18, Whetstone's =Rocke of Regard=, 2,"
259,SOURCES,"Fenton's =Tragicall Discourses=, 13, and Painter's =Palace of Pleasure=,"
260,SOURCES,"II, 29[18] have all been listed as possible sources for =Dom Diego and"
261,SOURCES,"Ginevra=.[19] Grosart regarded Fenton's work, 1579, as the source from"
262,SOURCES,"which Lynche got the bare bones of his story, and Arber agreed.[20]"
263,SOURCES,But though Jeannette Fellheimer could find no evidence that Lynche
264,SOURCES,"knew Belleforest's or Fenton's version of the tale, she demonstrated,"
265,SOURCES,"on the basis of two very close parallels, that he knew Painter's.[21]"
266,SOURCES,"In support of Fellheimer's view, one notes that Lynche follows Painter"
267,SOURCES,"in employing the form ""Cathelo[y]gne""[22] (p. 63) rather than Fenton's"
268,SOURCES,"""Catalonia.""[23]"
269,SOURCES,
270,SOURCES,"Barksted may have known ballads on the subject of Hiren, alluded to in"
271,SOURCES,"stanza 34 of his poem, as well as Peele's lost play =The Turkish"
272,SOURCES,"Mahomet and Hyren the fair Greek=. But like Lynche, he seems heavily"
273,SOURCES,"indebted to a tale by Painter, in this case ""Hyerenee the Faire"
274,SOURCES,"Greeke.""[24] Among other equally striking but less sustained"
275,SOURCES,correspondences between Painter's prose narrative and Barksted's minor
276,SOURCES,"epic verse, one notes the following, in which Mahomet's confidant"
277,SOURCES,"Mustapha attempts to reanimate his leader's martial spirit, drowned in"
278,SOURCES,"uxoriousness: ""But nowe I cannot revive the memorie of your father"
279,SOURCES,"Amurate, but to my great sorow and griefe, who by the space of XL."
280,SOURCES,yeres made the sea and earth to tremble and quake ... [and so cruelly
281,SOURCES,treated the Greeks] that the memorie of the woundes do remaine at this
282,SOURCES,"present, even to the mountaines of Thomao and Pindus: he subjugated"
283,SOURCES,"... all the barbarous nations, from Morea to the straits of Corinthe."
284,SOURCES,What neede I here to bring in the cruel battell that he fought with
285,SOURCES,the Emperour Sigismunde and Philip duke of Burgundia wherein he
286,SOURCES,"overthrew the whole force of the Christians, toke the emperour"
287,SOURCES,"prisoner, and the duke of Burgundie also ... or to remember other"
288,SOURCES,"fierce armies which he sent into Hungarie.""[25]"
289,SOURCES,
290,SOURCES,"Barksted versifies this speech in stanzas 1 and 2, putting it at the"
291,SOURCES,"beginning instead of toward the end, where it comes in Painter's"
292,SOURCES,"novella. By a poetic license, Barksted credits all these achievements"
293,SOURCES,"to the son, none to the father. Barksted follows Painter's story quite"
294,SOURCES,"closely, but he cuts, amplifies and invents in order to develop its"
295,SOURCES,"minor epic potentialities. Thus, in addition to turning Painter's"
296,SOURCES,"prose into the sixains of Shakespeare's =Venus and Adonis=, he cuts the"
297,SOURCES,"length of Painter's tale by about two-thirds. In the process, much of"
298,SOURCES,"Painter's attention to historical detail, his complication of plot,"
299,SOURCES,and his tedious moralizing are mercifully lost. By way of
300,SOURCES,"amplification in the minor epic mode, Barksted expands as follows"
301,SOURCES,"Mahomet's brief command in Painter that Hiren should ""adorne herselfe"
302,SOURCES,"with her most precious jewels, and decke her with the costliest"
303,SOURCES,"apparell shee had"" (see stanza 100).[26] Also, in order to bring out"
304,SOURCES,"Mahomet's realization of the enormity of his crime of slaying Hiren,"
305,SOURCES,"the consummation of all his amorous dreams, Barksted invents a second"
306,SOURCES,"killing--Mahomet's killing of Mustapha, who had driven his lord to"
307,SOURCES,perform the first execution.

311,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,
312,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"Like the poems reprinted by Professor Donno, these establish their"
313,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,identity as minor epics by the erotic subject matter of their
314,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"narration, however symbolized or moralized, and by their use of"
315,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,certain rhetorical devices that came to be associated with the genre.
316,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"These include the set description of people and places; the =suasoria=,"
317,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"or invitation to love; and the formal digression, sometimes in the"
318,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"form of an inset tale, such as the tale of Poplar in =Mirrha= (pp."
319,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,148-155). Other rhetorical devices cultivated in the epyllion are the
320,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"long apostrophe, and the sentence or wise saying. Also, these poems"
321,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,employ numerous compound epithets and far-fetched conceits. (Dom Diego
322,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"goes hunting with a ""beast-dismembring blade"" [p. 64], and Cinyras"
323,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"incestuous bed in =The Scourge= ""doth shake and quaver as they lie,/As"
324,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"if it groan'd to beare the weight of sinne."" [p. 271].)"
325,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,
326,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"The average length of these, like other Renaissance minor epics, is"
327,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,about 900 lines. Although the length of Renaissance minor epics is not
328,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"rigidly prescribed, it is noteworthy that several of these poems have"
329,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"almost the same number of lines. =Philos and Licia=, =Mirrha=, and =Hiren=,"
330,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"for example, running to about 900 lines, vary in length by no more"
331,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"than 16 lines. (=Amos and Laura=, however, the shortest with about 300"
332,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"lines, is some 650 lines shorter than =The Scourge=, the longest, with"
333,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,about 950.)
334,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,
335,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,As well as echoing Marlowe's =Hero and Leander= and Shakespeare's =Venus
336,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"and Adonis= in particular words and phrases, these poems reveal a much"
337,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"more general indebtedness to what Professor Bush has aptly called ""the"
338,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"twin peaks of the Ovidian tradition in England.""[27] The majority"
339,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,employ one of two prosodic patterns--the Marlovian couplet
340,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"popularized in =Hero and Leander=, or the six-line stanza used by Lodge"
341,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,but soon after taken over by Shakespeare in =Venus and Adonis= and
342,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,thereafter associated with his poem.[28]
343,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,
344,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"In addition to the couplet, a common mark of Marlovian influence in"
345,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"the poems is the etiological myth, sometimes expanded into a tale."
346,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"Thus, in =Mirrha=, for instance, the growth of rare spices and perfumes"
347,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,in Panchaia is explained by the story of how Hebe once spilled nectar

350,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,Comparable marks of Shakespearean influence are the aggressive female
351,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"like Mirrha, reminiscent of Shakespeare's Venus; the hunting motif in"
352,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"=Dom Diego= and =Amos and Laura=, recalling Adonis' obsession with the"
353,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"hunt; and the catalog of the senses in =Philos and Licia=, pp. 15-16,"
354,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"and =Hiren=, stanzas 75-79, which imitates Shakespeare's =Venus and"
355,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"Adonis=, ll. 427-450. Only =Mirrha= among these poems, however, makes"
356,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,specific acknowledgment of a debt to Shakespeare (see p. 177).
357,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"Finally, Dom Diego's plangent laments at Ginevra's cruelty recall"
358,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,Glaucus' unrestrained weeping at Scylla's cruelty in Lodge's =Scillaes
359,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"Metamorphosis=. But whereas the ""piteous Nimphes"" surrounding Glaucus"

362,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,he weeps. Consequently they gather (and presumably preserve) them with
363,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"""Spunge-like Mosse"" (p. 95). Lynche extends his debt to Lodge by"
364,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,establishing at the end of his poem a link between Ginevra and the
365,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"Maiden he professes to love. But, whereas Lodge in the Envoy to his"
366,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,poem uses Scylla on the rocks as a horrible example of what may happen
367,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"to unyielding maids, Lynche holds up Ginevra, who finally marries her"
368,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,"lover, as an example to be followed by the poet's disdainful Diella of"
369,FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS,the accompanying sonnets (see p. 101).

413,THE HISTORY OF THE EARLY EDITIONS,"apprenticed from 1591-99,[35] suggests that the poem was originally"
414,THE HISTORY OF THE EARLY EDITIONS,published by Newbery about 1596. Probably this first edition had the

439,THE HISTORY OF THE EARLY EDITIONS,"Henry Plomer agrees with Grosart that Edward Allde, the printer of"

497,LITERARY VALUE,LITERARY VALUE
498,LITERARY VALUE,
499,LITERARY VALUE,"Much of the literary value of these poems, it should be recognized, is"
500,LITERARY VALUE,"historical. Like Henry Petowe's romance, =The Second Part of Hero and"
501,LITERARY VALUE,"Leander= (1598), they are fully as interesting as reflections of the"
502,LITERARY VALUE,"poetic genius of Marlowe and/or Shakespeare, mirrored in the works of"
503,LITERARY VALUE,"their less gifted contemporaries, as they are in themselves. Apart"
504,LITERARY VALUE,"from their historical significance, however, all these poems have"
505,LITERARY VALUE,"intrinsic interest, and several, including =Dom Diego=, =Mirrha="
506,LITERARY VALUE,"and =Hiren= as well as =Philos and Licia=, have a considerable"
507,LITERARY VALUE,degree of literary merit as well. Whoever the author of Philos and
508,LITERARY VALUE,"Licia may have been, he was one who had thoroughly assimilated the"
509,LITERARY VALUE,"conventions of the minor epic, especially those employed in =Hero and"
510,LITERARY VALUE,"Leander=.[50] Unlike Page, whose imitation of Marlowe is for the most"
511,LITERARY VALUE,"part blind, this author is skillful in working many of these"
512,LITERARY VALUE,"conventions, and even particular words and phrases from other minor"
513,LITERARY VALUE,"epics, into the context of his poem, somewhat as the bards of major"
514,LITERARY VALUE,"epic are supposed to have done. Surprisingly, in view of this"
515,LITERARY VALUE,"technique of composition, the poem is well integrated, and"
516,LITERARY VALUE,consistently smooth and fluent in its versification.[51]
517,LITERARY VALUE,
518,LITERARY VALUE,"As much as this unknown poet must have admired Marlowe's verse, he"
519,LITERARY VALUE,evidently could not stomach the elder poet's conception of a hostile
520,LITERARY VALUE,"universe, or his glorification of unwedded bliss. Accordingly he"
521,LITERARY VALUE,constructed in =Philos and Licia= a world in which all goes well
522,LITERARY VALUE,"provided one follows the rules, and where one of the key rules is that"
523,LITERARY VALUE,Hymen's rites must precede love's consummation. One of Licia's chief
524,LITERARY VALUE,"responsibilities, in addition to summing up all feminine perfections,"
525,LITERARY VALUE,"is to enforce this rule. Philos, though severely tempted to violate"
526,LITERARY VALUE,"it, soon yields to Licia's virtuous admonitions, for he is, let it be"
527,LITERARY VALUE,"known, a pliant youth, almost as devoted to Licia's will as the knight"
528,LITERARY VALUE,in Chaucer's Wife of Bath's tale to the Loathly Lady's. The poem ends
529,LITERARY VALUE,"happily, with the gods attending the lovers' nuptials. The result of"
530,LITERARY VALUE,"this too easily ordered union of souls and bodies, unhappily for this"
531,LITERARY VALUE,"otherwise charming poem, is an insufficiency of conflict. Aside from"
532,LITERARY VALUE,"the poem's un-Marlovian insistence on matrimony, its most notable"
533,LITERARY VALUE,"feature is its skillful and sustained use of light and dark imagery,"
534,LITERARY VALUE,recalling Chapman's much less extensive treatment of such imagery in
535,LITERARY VALUE,his conclusion of Marlowe's poem and in Ovid's =Banquet of Sense=.
536,LITERARY VALUE,
537,LITERARY VALUE,Gale's =Pyramus and Thisbe= begins with a moderately engaging portrayal
538,LITERARY VALUE,"of the youngsters' innocent friendship; it soon falls into absurdity,"
539,LITERARY VALUE,from which it never subsequently gets entirely clear. Gale seems to
540,LITERARY VALUE,"have had no inkling of the ridiculous possibilities of ""serious"""
541,LITERARY VALUE,"verse. Consequently, he is able to write of Pyramus and Thisbe"
542,LITERARY VALUE,"""sit[ting] on bryers,/Till they enjoyd the height of their desires,"""
543,LITERARY VALUE,"(Stanza 13), with no sense of the incongruity of the image employed."
544,LITERARY VALUE,"With similar ill effect in its pathetic context, Thisbe's nose bleed"
545,LITERARY VALUE,"is introduced as an omen of disaster (Stanza 33), and Pyramus' ""angry"""
546,LITERARY VALUE,"blood, by a ridiculously far-fetched conceit, is said to gush out ""to"
547,LITERARY VALUE,"finde the author of the deed,/But when it none but =Pyramus= had found,/"
548,LITERARY VALUE,"Key cold with feare it stood upon the ground"" (Stanza 30)."
549,LITERARY VALUE,
550,LITERARY VALUE,"=Dom Diego=, though a pleasant, occasionally charming imitation of"
551,LITERARY VALUE,"Lodge's =Scillaes Metamorphosis=, employs fewer of the epyllionic"
552,LITERARY VALUE,"conventions than =Philos and Licia=, and uses them less imaginatively."
553,LITERARY VALUE,"Though it never achieves a style of its own, it is quite successful in"
554,LITERARY VALUE,recapturing the lachrymose artificiality that marks Lodge's poem.
555,LITERARY VALUE,
556,LITERARY VALUE,"Despite its oblique opening and occasionally awkward style, Barksted's"
557,LITERARY VALUE,=Mirrha= is a poem of more power than =Dom Diego=. Among its more
558,LITERARY VALUE,"affecting passages are a vivid portrayal of a ""gloomy gallerie"" lined"
559,LITERARY VALUE,with portraits of Mirrha's suitors (p. 128) and an inventive account
560,LITERARY VALUE,of Hebe's spilling the nectar that rained spices on Panchaia (p. 147).
561,LITERARY VALUE,Barksted's early and unqualified recognition of Shakespeare's
562,LITERARY VALUE,"greatness, and his humbly accurate assessment of his own limited"
563,LITERARY VALUE,"powers, compared to ""neighbor"" Shakespeare's, are quite disarming. One"
564,LITERARY VALUE,"gets the uncomfortable sense, however, that Barksted in both =Mirrha="
565,LITERARY VALUE,"and =Hiren=, like H. A. in =The Scourge= after him, is a moral fence"
566,LITERARY VALUE,"straddler, enjoying vicariously the lasciviousness he so piously"
567,LITERARY VALUE,reprehends.
568,LITERARY VALUE,
569,LITERARY VALUE,=Hiren= as treated by Barksted is also deficient in imagination of a
570,LITERARY VALUE,"high order, but is a more absorbing story than =Mirrha=. As signaled by"
571,LITERARY VALUE,his undertaking a more intricately rhymed stanza than he attempted in
572,LITERARY VALUE,"his first poem, Barksted's versification and composition in the second"
573,LITERARY VALUE,poem are superior. The poet achieves his most telling effects in =Hiren=
574,LITERARY VALUE,not from invention but from the elaboration of such source materials
575,LITERARY VALUE,in Painter as permit him to capture the distinctive glittering
576,LITERARY VALUE,artifice of minor epic. His catalog of the senses (Stanzas 75-79)
577,LITERARY VALUE,serves as an example of this power of embellishment at its best.
578,LITERARY VALUE,
579,LITERARY VALUE,"Page's =Amos and Laura=, like Gale's =Pyramus and Thisbe=, falls into"
580,LITERARY VALUE,"bathos near the end when Amos, in an extended comparison, likens"
581,LITERARY VALUE,Laura's refusal to cure his love wound to an avaricious doctor's
582,LITERARY VALUE,refusal to set a poor man's leg. Page's failure as a poet is not a
583,LITERARY VALUE,"result of temporary lapses, as here, but of his inability to invent"
584,LITERARY VALUE,"significant conflict. As Amos says, with unintentional irony on page"
585,LITERARY VALUE,235:
586,LITERARY VALUE,
587,LITERARY VALUE,"There are no Seas to separate our joy,"
588,LITERARY VALUE,No future danger can our Love annoy.
589,LITERARY VALUE,
590,LITERARY VALUE,This is precisely the problem. But in spite of the poem's obvious
591,LITERARY VALUE,"weakness, one is drawn to the man who wrote it for his obviously"
592,LITERARY VALUE,"sincere, self-deprecatory references to his ""weake wit"" and ""inferiour"
593,LITERARY VALUE,"stile."" Fully aware of his limitations, Page, like Barksted and many"
594,LITERARY VALUE,"another unexceptional talent of his age, was nevertheless drawn to the"
595,LITERARY VALUE,composition of poetry like a moth to the flame.
596,LITERARY VALUE,
597,LITERARY VALUE,=The Scourge= is a straightforward and lively but undistinguished
598,LITERARY VALUE,"redaction, in sing-song verse, of the well-worn Mirrha story. Its"
599,LITERARY VALUE,"chief but nevertheless dubious merit, over against the epyllionic"
600,LITERARY VALUE,"tradition, is its no-nonsense approach to the art of minor epic"
601,LITERARY VALUE,narration. Although it expands Ovid's speeches and descriptions where
602,LITERARY VALUE,"feasible and introduces a degree of invention en route, it is"
603,LITERARY VALUE,"singularly barren of such adornments as epithets, set descriptions,"
604,LITERARY VALUE,"and formal digressions. In consequence, it lacks the distinctive hard,"
605,LITERARY VALUE,bejewelled brilliance of minor epic that characterizes Barksted's
606,LITERARY VALUE,poetry at its best.
607,LITERARY VALUE,
608,LITERARY VALUE,"In summation, then, we see that although =Pyramus and Thisbe= and =Amos"
609,LITERARY VALUE,"and Laura= have slight literary value, =The Scourge=, while failing to"
610,LITERARY VALUE,"score very high as a minor epic, yet has a certain crude, narrative"
611,LITERARY VALUE,"vitality. And =Dom Diego=, =Mirrha=, =Hiren=, and =Philos and Licia=, by"
612,LITERARY VALUE,"virtue of their charm, inventiveness, or skillful adaptation of minor"
613,LITERARY VALUE,"epic conventions to their expressive needs, form a hierarchy of"
614,LITERARY VALUE,increasing literary value that raises them as a group well above the
615,LITERARY VALUE,level of the merely imitative.

999,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"The enuious pillow, which did beare her head,"
1000,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Was with it selfe at warre, and mutined:"
1001,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"For if the midst receiu'd her chaste impression,"
1002,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Then the two ends would swell at such a blessing;
1003,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And if she chanst to turne her head aside,"
1004,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Gracing one end with natures only pride,"
1005,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"The rest for enuy straight would swell so much,"
1006,PHILOS AND LICIA.,As it would leape asunder for a touch.
1007,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Her Sun-out-shining eyes were now at set,"
1008,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Yet somewhat sparkling through their cabinet;
1009,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Her scorne white forehead was made vp by nature,"
1010,PHILOS AND LICIA.,To be a patterne to succeeding creature
1011,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Of her admiring skill: her louely cheeke,"
1012,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"To Rose, nor Lyllie, will I euer leeke,"
1013,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Whose wondrous beautie had that boy but prou'd,"
1014,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Who died for loue, and yet not any lou'd,"
1015,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Neuer had riuer beene adorned so,"
1016,PHILOS AND LICIA.,To burie more then all the world could shew.
1017,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Her sweetest breath from out those sweeter lips,"
1018,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Much like coole winde which from the valleys skips
1019,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"In parching heat of Summer, stealeth forth,"
1020,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Wandring amongst her haire; her wel formd mouth:
1021,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"No art hath left vs such proportion,"
1022,PHILOS AND LICIA.,To modell out so true perfection.
1023,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Her smoothe moist hands the sheets kept from his sight,"
1024,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Lest by comparing, they should staine their white."
1025,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"As thus she lay like _Venus_ in her pride,"
1026,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"(Tempting sweet _Adon_, lowring by her side)"
1027,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"_Philos_ approcht, who with this sight strooke dumbe"
1028,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Came stealing on to see, and being come,"
1029,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"His greedie eye, which on the sudden meets"
1030,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"So many various and delicious sweets,"
1031,PHILOS AND LICIA.,As rackt with pleasure (neuer hauing fill)
1032,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Would faine looke off, and yet would looke on still."
1033,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Thus do we surfet on our sudden ioyes,"
1034,PHILOS AND LICIA.,And ranck-fed pleasure thus it selfe destroyes:
1035,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"For when his eye doth light vpon her hand,"
1036,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"He then protests, that that is whitenesse land;"
1037,PHILOS AND LICIA.,But when the whitenesse of her whiter brow
1038,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Doth steale his eye from thence, he sweareth now"
1039,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Her brow is fellowlesse without all peere;
1040,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"When being snatcht off vnto her fairer haire,"
1041,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"He vowes, the Sun, which makes trees burnisht gold,"
1042,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Is not so faire, nor glorious to behold:"
1043,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"The viewing the strains which through those cheeks appeare,"
1044,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And that pure whitenesse which triumpheth there,"
1045,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Mixt with those azure Saphire passing vaines,"
1046,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Which are insert like siluer running streames,"
1047,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Watring those golden apples of the brests,"
1048,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Where heauens delight & earths contentment rests,"
1049,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"His full-fed eye orecome with such excesse,"
1050,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Sweares and forsweares, denies and doth confesse:"
1051,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Then doth he touch her lips, Natures rich treasure,"
1052,PHILOS AND LICIA.,And musing thinks which is the greatest pleasure
1053,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"To kisse or see; for to resolue which doubt,"
1054,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Againe he kisses, whence comes stealing out"
1055,PHILOS AND LICIA.,So sweet a breath as doth confound his sence;
1056,PHILOS AND LICIA.,For rarest obiects hurt with excellence:
1057,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Then doth he seise her hand with softest straine,"
1058,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Whose moist rebound doth easily detaine
1059,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"A willing guest, who purposely could wish"
1060,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Noother food, but such a well-grac't dish."
1061,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Whiles thus poore _Philos_ kisses, feeles and sees,"
1062,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Heauen-staining _Licia_ opes her sparkling eyes,"
1063,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And askt the hopelesse Louer, if mornes eye"
1064,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Had out-stript night. _Philos_ made answer, I."
1065,PHILOS AND LICIA.,And thus the Louer did continuallie:
1066,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"For why, such lustre glided from her eie,"
1067,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Which darkt the Sun, whose glory all behold,"
1068,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"So that she knew not day, till some man told."
1069,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Which office she to _Philos_ had assign'd,"
1070,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Because she had him alwayes most in mind:
1071,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Which had he knowne, he would not so haue spent"
1072,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"The restlesse nights in drery languishment,"
1073,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Tumbling and tossing in his lothsome bed,"
1074,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"To flie from griefe, yet that still followed."
1075,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Then rising vp, and running here and there,"
1076,PHILOS AND LICIA.,As if he could outrun or lose his care;
1077,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"But being vp, and finding no reliefe,"
1078,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Lookt in his heart, and there he found out griefe."
1079,PHILOS AND LICIA.,How cam'st thou hither (then amaine he cries)
1080,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"To kil my heart? Griefe answerd, Through his eyes."
1081,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Mine eyes (quoth he) subornd to murder me?
1082,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Well, for their treason they no more shall see."
1083,PHILOS AND LICIA.,With that a floud of teeres gush out amaine;
1084,PHILOS AND LICIA.,But griefe sends sighs to beat them backe againe:
1085,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"So that the hurt he meant to do his eies,"
1086,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Heart-murdring griefe resists, and it denies."
1087,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Whereat amazd, as one bereft of sence,"
1088,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"His eies fixt fast on her, as if from thence"
1089,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"His soule had gone, he cri'd: ôh, let this moue,"
1090,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Loue me for pitie, or pitie me for loue."
1091,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Though I am blacke, yet do me not despise,"
1092,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Loue looks as sweet in blacke as faire mens eies.
1093,PHILOS AND LICIA.,The world may yeeld one fairer to your view;
1094,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Not all the world fairer in loue to you.
1095,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"A iewell dropt in mire to sight ilfauoured,"
1096,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Now, as before, in worth is valued;"
1097,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"An orient pearle hung in an Indians eare,"
1098,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Receiues no blemish, but doth shew more faire;"
1099,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"One Diamond, compared with another,"
1100,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Darks his bright lustre, & their worth doth smother;"
1101,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Where poised with a thing of light esteeme,"
1102,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Their worth is knowen, and their great beauty seene."
1103,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Set white to white, and who commendeth either?"
1104,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Set white to blacke, and then the white's the fairer."
1105,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"The glorious Sunne, when in his glittring pride,"
1106,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Scowring the heauens, in progresse he doth ride,"
1107,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Who runnes to see? or who his sight doth lacke?
1108,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"But if he chance to shute himselfe in blacke,"
1109,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Then the earths people couet him to see,"
1110,PHILOS AND LICIA.,As if he were some wondrous prodegie.
1111,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"The worlds perfection, at the highest rated,"
1112,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Was of a blacke confused thing created.

1115,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Since then by blacke, perfection most is knowne,"

1117,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Mole gracing _Venus_ neuer shewed so faire,"

1119,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"As thou by me: the people, as we pace,"
1120,PHILOS AND LICIA.,By my defects shall wonder at thy grace;
1121,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And seeing me so swarthie and so tawnie,"

1124,PHILOS AND LICIA.,That tis thy beautie which hath tann'd me so.
1125,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Thy dangling tresses, if compar'd with mine,"
1126,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Glitter like heauen with lustre from thine eine:
1127,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And those immortall eies, which like the Sunne,"
1128,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"The lookers on with his bright rayes doth burne,"
1129,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"If mine be nie, will seeme to shine more cleere,"
1130,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Than glittering _Venus_ in her Hemisphere.
1131,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"So thy rich worth, compared with my pelfe,"
1132,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Will in excelling others match thy selfe:

1317,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Whose powrfull accents, so constraining loue,"
1318,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Had they beene knowen to Thunder-darting _Ioue_,"
1319,PHILOS AND LICIA.,He neuer needed to haue vs'd such shapes
1320,PHILOS AND LICIA.,For to commit his slie stolne headdy rapes:
1321,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Or to _Apollo_, when his harebraind sonne,"
1322,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"The proud aspiring lucklesse _Phaeton_,"
1323,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Would guide the lampe of heauen he then had staid,"
1324,PHILOS AND LICIA.,And to his Sires graue counsels had obaid:
1325,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Beast-mouing _Orpheus_, and stones void of sence,"
1326,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Ore which his musicke had preheminence,"
1327,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Did not inchant so by his power diuine,"
1328,PHILOS AND LICIA.,As doth that Adamantine tongue of thine.
1329,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Iudge me not light, that I so soone do yeeld"
1330,PHILOS AND LICIA.,To part from that which I so deerely held;
1331,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"For where a likely beautie doth request,"
1332,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Euen at the first, Loue ransacketh the brest:"
1333,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And though maids seem coy, yet the heart is strooke"
1334,PHILOS AND LICIA.,At the first glancing of an amourous looke:
1335,PHILOS AND LICIA.,For from the Louer to the loued eie
1336,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Passeth the visuall beames, which gendred nie"
1337,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Vnto the heart, they thither hie amaine,"
1338,PHILOS AND LICIA.,And there her bloud do secretly inflame
1339,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"With strange desires, faint hopes, and longing feares,"
1340,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Vnheard of wishes, thoughts begetting teares,"
1341,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"That ere she is aware she's farre in loue,"
1342,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Yet knowes no cause that should affection moue.
1343,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"I could be froward, techie, sullen, mute,"
1344,PHILOS AND LICIA.,And with loue-killing looks repell thy sute;
1345,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Contemne the speaking letters which thou sends;
1346,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Command thine absence, and reiect thy friends;"
1347,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Neglect thy presents, and thy vowes despise;"
1348,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And laughing at thy teeres, force teeres arise;"
1349,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Making thee spend a deale of precious time
1350,PHILOS AND LICIA.,To get that heart which at the first was thine.
1351,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"More I could say. But he content with this,"
1352,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Closd vp the sentence with a sugred kisse.
1353,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"She seemd displeasd, till kissing her againe,"
1354,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"_Achilles_ like, he tooke away her paine:"
1355,PHILOS AND LICIA.,And then in close coucht termes would faine desire
1356,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Loues highest blisse, than which there is no higher:"
1357,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"But yet the bashfull boy knew not what art,"
1358,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"What termes to vse, or how for to impart"
1359,PHILOS AND LICIA.,His secret meaning; for he blusht for shame
1360,PHILOS AND LICIA.,To thinke what he should aske; & then would faine
1361,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Haue made his bolder hand supply the roome
1362,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Of his tongues office, which was mute and dumbe;"
1363,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"The which he layes vpon her siluer brest,"
1364,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Where little _Cupid_ slumbring takes his rest;
1365,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Betweene the which an amourous streame doth run,"
1366,PHILOS AND LICIA.,That leads the way vnto _Elysium_.
1367,PHILOS AND LICIA.,I wonder much (quoth he) when _Ioue_ did make
1368,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"A treble night for faire _Alcmenaes_ sake,"
1369,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"She nere perceiued that the night was long,"
1370,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Since all eyes wait vpon the rising sunne:
1371,PHILOS AND LICIA.,But sure some melting pleasure did detaine
1372,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Her willing senses, and did so enchaine"
1373,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Her captiue minde, that time vnthought of fled,"
1374,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Long nights in sweets being swiftly buried.
1375,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Might I such dalliance craue, as great _Ioue_ did"
1376,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Of faire _Alcmena_; or when he lay hid
1377,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"In the swannes shape; how happy were I then,"
1378,PHILOS AND LICIA.,And how farre blest aboue all other men!
1379,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"For this, the gods themselues haue often woed,"
1380,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Courted, adored, kneeld vnto and sued,"
1381,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Left heauen, their glory, pompe and maiestie,"
1382,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And put aside their glittring deitie,"
1383,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"To get this iewell, which yeelds true content."
1384,PHILOS AND LICIA.,When that seuerer state perhaps gan ornament
1385,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Of inward woe, let mortals be excus'd,"
1386,PHILOS AND LICIA.,When deities such amourous tricks haue vs'd.
1387,PHILOS AND LICIA.,O wit abusing boy (sweet _Licia_ cried;)
1388,PHILOS AND LICIA.,The gods for that were neuer deified:
1389,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Though they did vse it, and obserue it well,"
1390,PHILOS AND LICIA.,When ere they did it (as all Poets tell)
1391,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"They from their godheads long before were turnd,"
1392,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And to some monstrous beast they were transformd,"
1393,PHILOS AND LICIA.,And in that shape did act lasciuiousnesse:
1394,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"For lust transformes vs beasts, and no whit lesse"
1395,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Do we than they, but yet deserue more blame,"
1396,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"We hauing reason, whose reproofe should tame"
1397,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Rebell-affection, and not to let it grow,"
1398,PHILOS AND LICIA.,To worke his owne vntimely ouerthrow.
1399,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Insatiate lust as Spring-frosts nips the growth
1400,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Of Natures fairest blossomes, crops the worth"
1401,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Of her best hopes, nay's foe vnto delight,"
1402,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Dulling the keene edge of our appetite,"
1403,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Whose rancke desire, much like the Ocean,"
1404,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Whose swelling ridges no bound can containe,"
1405,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Oreflowes whole sands, and in her emptie wombe"
1406,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Buries them all; Euen so doth lust intombe
1407,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"All disrancke thoughts, sin-breeding interuiewes,"
1408,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Disordred passions, all dishonest shewes"
1409,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Of what may fatten vice; like thriftlesse heires
1410,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Lusts champians are, which kill their dearest Sires"
1411,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"For their possessions, to giue both life and growth"
1412,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"To helborne riot. So lasciuious youth,"
1413,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Courting our beauties, cares not to pollute"
1414,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Our soules for that, though left heauens substitute"
1415,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"To bridle passion. Gentle boy refraine,"

1417,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"With sacred fire hath warmd vs, and her rites"
1418,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Fully performd do warrant those delites.
1419,PHILOS AND LICIA.,By this the Soueraigne of heauens flaming beame
1420,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Had got the full height of the starrie heauen,"
1421,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And she requests the boy, that for a while"
1422,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"He will depart the roome, she may beguile"
1423,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"The clothes of her blest presence. He obaid,"
1424,PHILOS AND LICIA.,And in a chamber next to hers he staid.
1425,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"He being gone, the sheets away she flung,"
1426,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Which loth to let her go, about her clung;"
1427,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And as she stroue to get out from the sheet,"
1428,PHILOS AND LICIA.,The vpper clothes imprisond both her feet;
1429,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Yet out she whips, and them away she throwes,"
1430,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Couering her beauties with the ioyfull clothes:
1431,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Her purple veluet gowne with gold-starres mixt,"
1432,PHILOS AND LICIA.,And euery starre with spangles set betwixt
1433,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Of purest siluer, with a twist of gold,"
1434,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Would much amaze the gazers to behold.
1435,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"This starrie garment did she first put on,"
1436,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Which tooke light from her face as from the Sun.
1437,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Her mantle was of richest taffatie,"
1438,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Where _Iupiter_ was seruing _Danae_,"
1439,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"So liuely wrought by _Vestaes_ chastest Nun,"
1440,PHILOS AND LICIA.,As much delighted the sweet lookers on.
1441,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Her stomacher was all with diamonds set,"
1442,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Ore which a fall was plac'd with pearles with net,"
1443,PHILOS AND LICIA.,And at each pearle (which seemd to darke the skie)
1444,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Hung glistring Rubies and rich Porpherie.
1445,PHILOS AND LICIA.,A bracelet all of pearle her hands did grace;
1446,PHILOS AND LICIA.,For to her hands all orients are but base.
1447,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"A scarfe of maiden-blush did seeme to hide her,"
1448,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Wherein _Diana_ when _Acteon_ spide her,"
1449,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Herselfe had wrought, looking with such disdaine,"
1450,PHILOS AND LICIA.,As witnest well his after-following paine;
1451,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"One end whereof had yong _Leanders_ shape,"
1452,PHILOS AND LICIA.,When through the swelling main (whose waues did gape)
1453,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"He sought his chastest _Hero_, beating from him"
1454,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"The waues, which murmuring stroue for to com nere him:"
1455,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And at the other, matchlesse _Hero_ stood"
1456,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Viewing _Leander_ tossed by the flood,"
1457,PHILOS AND LICIA.,And how the churlish billowes beat that head
1458,PHILOS AND LICIA.,On which herselfe was so enamoured;
1459,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Praying to _Neptune_, not to be so cruell,"
1460,PHILOS AND LICIA.,But to deliuer vp her dearest iewell:
1461,PHILOS AND LICIA.,To figure to the world whose shining eies
1462,PHILOS AND LICIA.,She set two diamonds of highest prise.
1463,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Vpon her head she ware a vaile of lawne,"
1464,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Eclipsing halfe her eyes, through which they shone"
1465,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"As doth the bright Sun, being shadowed"
1466,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"By pale thin clouds, through which white streaks are spred."
1467,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Poore _Philos_ wondred why she staid so long,"
1468,PHILOS AND LICIA.,And oft lookt out and mus'd she did not come.
1469,PHILOS AND LICIA.,What need she decke her selfe with art (quoth he)
1470,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Or hide those beauties with her brauerie,"
1471,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Which addeth glory to the meanst attire?
1472,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"What if she went in her loose flagging haire,"
1473,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Spread at his full length, that the Easterne winde"
1474,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Might tie loue-knots for _Cupid_ to vntwinde,"
1475,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"With some trasparent garment ore her skin,"
1476,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Through which her naked glory might be seene:
1477,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Then as _Diana_ a hunting might she goe;
1478,PHILOS AND LICIA.,But she nor needs her arrowes nor a bow:
1479,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"For all the beasts that should but see her passe,"
1480,PHILOS AND LICIA.,With w[=o]dring straight would leaue the perled grasse
1481,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And feed their eyes, while with her snowy hand"
1482,PHILOS AND LICIA.,She take what beasts she please; nor more command
1483,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Needs she to keepe them: for her iuory palme
1484,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Commandeth more than any iron chaine.
1485,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"But now she's come, at whose thrise radiant light"
1486,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"As all amazd he shunnes her glorious sight,"
1487,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Like those which long in darke, chance to espie"
1488,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"A candles glimmering, if it come but nie,"
1489,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Can not endure that weake and feeble shine,"
1490,PHILOS AND LICIA.,But straightway shut their dim and dazled eine.
1491,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"No maruell then, though in great extasie"
1492,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"His spirits are, at glittring maiestie."
1493,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"She feares the worst, and to her Louer skips,"
1494,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Claps his plumpe cheeks, and beats his corall lips,"
1495,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And seeing him fall breathlesse to the earth,"
1496,PHILOS AND LICIA.,She seeks with kisses to inspire his breath.
1497,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"At last his eye-lids he vp heaues againe,"
1498,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And feeling her sweet kisses, gins to faine;"
1499,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Shuts his bright eyes, and stops his rosie breath,"
1500,PHILOS AND LICIA.,And for her kisses counterfeits his death.
1501,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"With that poore _Licia_ both her hands vpholds,"
1502,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And those let fall, her wofull armes enfolds,"
1503,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"With cast vp eyes in labour with her teares,"
1504,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Which ioy did weep for woe to leaue those spheares
1505,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Which downe her face made paths vnto her necke,"
1506,PHILOS AND LICIA.,And setling there shewd like a carquenet;
1507,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Anon she teares her haire, away it flings,"
1508,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Which twining on her fingers shewd like rings;
1509,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Then she assayes to speake, but sighs and teares"
1510,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Eats vp her words and multiplies her feares.
1511,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Why wert thou borne (quoth she) to die so soone,"
1512,PHILOS AND LICIA.,And leaue the world poore of perfection;
1513,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Or why did high heauen frame thee such a creature,"
1514,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"So soone to perish: ô selfe-hurting Nature,"
1515,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Why didst thou suffer death to steale him hence,"
1516,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Who was thy glory and thy excellence.
1517,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"What are the Roses red, now he is gone,"
1518,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"But like the broke sparks of a diamond,"
1519,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Whose scattred pieces shadow to the eye
1520,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"What the whole was, and adde to miserie?"
1521,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Such this faire casket of a fairer iem,"
1522,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Whose beautie matchlesse now, what was it then"
1523,PHILOS AND LICIA.,When that his precious breath gaue life and sent

1527,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Thou friend to none but sepulchers and graues,"
1528,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"High reared monuments, lasting Epitaphs,"
1529,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Poore Clearks & Sextons, and some thriftlesse heires,"
1530,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Depriued Priests, and a few Courtiers,"
1531,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Who hauing liuings in reuersion,"
1532,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Do dayly pray for quicke possession;
1533,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Who had offended thee, that blinde with rage"
1534,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Thou strookst at him, for whom succeeding age"
1535,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Will curse thy bones? Physitians be thy baine,"
1536,PHILOS AND LICIA.,And chase thee hence to lowest hell againe.
1537,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"He hearing this, from pleasing death reuiues,"
1538,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And drunke those teeres from her immortall eies,"
1539,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Which drop by drop sought other to displace,"
1540,PHILOS AND LICIA.,That each might kisse that sweet and daintie face.
1541,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Nor doth the Soueraigne of heauens golden fires,"

1543,PHILOS AND LICIA.,When with a smiling countenance he orelooks
1544,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"The flowrie fields and siluer streaming brooks,"
1545,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"As _Licia_ in his life was comforted,"
1546,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Whom new before she thought for to be dead:
1547,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"She locks her fingers in his crisped haire,"
1548,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And pulles it out at length, which leauing there,"
1549,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"The haire bands backe at it for ioy had leapt,"
1550,PHILOS AND LICIA.,To be a prisoner to hand so white:
1551,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And then she stroaks his alabaster skin,"

1553,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Glassing herselfe within his matchlesse eyes,"
1554,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Where little _Cupids_ conquering forces lies.
1555,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Faire Deere (quoth he) to night now wil I leaue you,"

1569,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Vnto her needle in all haste she goes,"
1570,PHILOS AND LICIA.,For to beguile her passions and her woes.
1571,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"She first begins a smocke, of greater cost"

1573,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Her husbands fame and honour, and thereby"
1574,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Had almost kept our now lost dignitie:
1575,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"For _Paris_ first, when as he came to bed,"
1576,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"On that rich smocke was so enamoured,"
1577,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And so attentiuely beheld the same,"
1578,PHILOS AND LICIA.,That he forgot almost for what he came:
1579,PHILOS AND LICIA.,For on the coller and the seame before
1580,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Was big-bon'd _Hercules_ and the _Minetaure_,"
1581,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Both wrought so liuely, that the bloud which came"

1583,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Her smocke below; which running here and there
1584,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Workt in red silke, did new and fresh appeare;"
1585,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Which made yong _Paris_ doubt, and thinke indeed"
1586,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"She was not well, and askt and she did bleed;"
1587,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And would needs see: but wide the curtains drawn,"
1588,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"There was some iewell sparkled through the lawn,"
1589,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Which pleasd him so, that he had quite forgot"
1590,PHILOS AND LICIA.,The curious working of the rich wrought smocke.
1591,PHILOS AND LICIA.,But loue-blest _Licia_ in her smocke delights
1592,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"To worke of pleasing tales and marriage rites,"
1593,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Of louers sweet stolne sports, and of the rapes"
1594,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Of gods immortall, and of maidens scapes:"
1595,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"There might you see _Mars_ conquering _Venus_ shrowd,"

1600,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Sate in her throne to heare the Troians cries.
1601,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Beneath this same she wrought a boistrous storme,"
1602,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Whereas the mercy-wanting winds had torne
1603,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"The tops of loftie trees, and rent the roots"
1604,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Of stately Cedars and of aged oakes:
1605,PHILOS AND LICIA.,The horrid thunder with his dreadfull claps
1606,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Made yawn the mouth of heauen, from whose great gaps"
1607,PHILOS AND LICIA.,The fearefull lightning flasht: and then againe
1608,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"_Ioue_ squeesd the clouds, & powrd down snow & rain."
1609,PHILOS AND LICIA.,In this same storme she wrought the Tyrian Queene
1610,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And great _Æneas_, who that day had beene"
1611,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Hunting the fallow deere, and thither came"
1612,PHILOS AND LICIA.,To shrowd themselues from tempest and raine.
1613,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Into a bushie caue hard by they got,"
1614,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Which thicke set trees did couer ore the top;
1615,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"In which the Carthage Queene _Æneas_ led,"
1616,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Who there deceiu'd her of her maidenhead.
1617,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"A scarfe besides she made of cunning frame,"
1618,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Whereas _Alcides_ club and armour throwne,"
1619,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"His lion skin put off, in maids attire"
1620,PHILOS AND LICIA.,He grad the wheele at _Omphales_ desire.
1621,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And all this night she banisht sleepe by worke,"
1622,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Who in her chamber priuily did lurke,"
1623,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Tempting her eye-lids to conspire with him,"
1624,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Who often times would winke and ope again:

1628,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Her curious worke, and doth in haste prouide:"
1629,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"For the faire fountaine which not far off stands,"
1630,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Whose purling noise vpon the golden sands
1631,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Inuites each weary wandring passenger
1632,PHILOS AND LICIA.,To see and taste those streames which are so cleare.

1634,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Vpon the which there grew (the more to grace it)
1635,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"All sorts of coloured flowers, which seemd to looke"
1636,PHILOS AND LICIA.,And glasse themselues within that siluer brooke.
1637,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Plentie of grasse did euery where appeare,"
1638,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Nurst by the moisture of the running riuer,"
1639,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Which euer flourishing still a beautious greene,"
1640,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Shewd like the palace of the Summers Queene:
1641,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"For neither frost nor cold did nip those flowers,"
1642,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Nor Sunburnt Autumne parch those leafie bowers:
1643,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And as she goes to bathe, the tender grasse"
1644,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Twineth about her, loth to let her passe:"
1645,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Here loue-strucke brambles plucke her by the gown,"
1646,PHILOS AND LICIA.,There roses kisse her as she walks along.
1647,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"When being come vnto the riuer side,"
1648,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Looking about, for feare she should be spide,"
1649,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"She stript her naked, standing on the brinke,"
1650,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"When the deere water, who ten yeeres did thinke"
1651,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Till she was in, conspired with the banke,"
1652,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"That downe it fell, and all vnwares she sanke"
1653,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Vp to the brests; then it inclos'd her round,"
1654,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Kisses each part, and from the purling ground"
1655,PHILOS AND LICIA.,The vnder-streames made haste to come and view
1656,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Those beauties which no earth could euer shew.
1657,PHILOS AND LICIA.,The slimy fishes with their watry finnes
1658,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Stand gazing on her, and close by her swimmes,"
1659,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And as she mou'd they mou'd, she needs no bait,"
1660,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"For as when _Orpheus_ plaid, so do they wait."
1661,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And purple _Titan_, whom some fogs did shrowd,"
1662,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Perforce brake forth from his imprisond cloud
1663,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"To gaze vpon her, whose reflecting beames"
1664,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"When hot she felt, she leaues the watry streames;"
1665,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Which they perceiuing, lessened her strength,"
1666,PHILOS AND LICIA.,To make her stay; yet out she got at length:
1667,PHILOS AND LICIA.,For which the waters are at enmitie
1668,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"With the Sunnes bright and glorious maiestie,"
1669,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And euery morning, ere _Apollo_ rise,"
1670,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"They send blacke vapours vp to his darke eies,"
1671,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And maske his beautie, that he be not seene"
1672,PHILOS AND LICIA.,To hinder them of such a blessed blessing.
1673,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Now vp she gets, and homeward fast she goes,"
1674,PHILOS AND LICIA.,And by the way is musing of the ioyes
1675,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"To morrowes day should yeeld, and wisht it come;"
1676,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"But her swift wishes ouergoe the Sunne,"
1677,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Which to her thinking, like a tired man"
1678,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Heauily loaden, vp a hill doth come."
1679,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Ay me (quoth she) had _Thetis_ _Daphnes_ grace,"
1680,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Then wouldst thou ierke thy horses, and apace"
1681,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Scowre through the azurd skie: but for she's old,"
1682,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Wanting white snowy armes for to enfold
1683,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Thy golden body, therefore thou doest moue"
1684,PHILOS AND LICIA.,(As though new parted from some amorous loue)
1685,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Not like a man trudging with more than haste,"
1686,PHILOS AND LICIA.,That he might clip his louers melting waste.
1687,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Were I the ruler of that fierie teame,"
1688,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Bloud would I fetch, and force them leape amaine"
1689,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Into the sea, and ouerspread the skie"
1690,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"With pitchie clouds, their darkesome liuerie."
1691,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Yet home she hies in hope to finde the boy
1692,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Which soone would turne those sorrowes into ioy:
1693,PHILOS AND LICIA.,But he was absent; for much time he spent
1694,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"To make his horse fit for the Turnament,"
1695,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Which with his curtelax and drery lance
1696,PHILOS AND LICIA.,He meant to holde her beautie to aduance:
1697,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"When missing him, she knew not how to spend"
1698,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"The weary day, nor bring it to end;"
1699,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"But calls her maid to beare her companie,"
1700,PHILOS AND LICIA.,And willed her to tell some historie
1701,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Which she had read or heard, to mocke the time;"
1702,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Who with a sober smile did thus beginne:
1703,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"In Crete there dwelt a boy of so good grace,"
1704,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"So wondrous beautie, such a louely face,"
1705,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"An eye so liuely, such a cherrie lip,"
1706,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"So white a belly and so strait a hip,"
1707,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"So well shapt, faire, in euery part and lim,"
1708,PHILOS AND LICIA.,That Nature was in loue with making him.
1709,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"This boy would oft resort vnto the Lawnes,"
1710,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"To rouse the Satyres and the nimble fawnes,"
1711,PHILOS AND LICIA.,That he might chase them; but the fearefull deere
1712,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Loue-taken by his presence, would not stirre:"
1713,PHILOS AND LICIA.,So he was faine (when he would haue some play)
1714,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Himselfe to run, and then they scud away"
1715,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And follow him, and in the place he stands"
1716,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Come lightly tripping for to licke his hands:
1717,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And if the lion chanst for to espie him,"
1718,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"He would away, looke back, but not come nie him,"
1719,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Lest he should feare him, and complaine of Nature,"
1720,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"That she had made him such a horrid creature,"
1721,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And wish himselfe to be the gentle hare,"
1722,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"The timorous sheepe, or any beast that were,"
1723,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"So he might gaze on him, and not beasts king,"
1724,PHILOS AND LICIA.,To be depriu'd of so endeerd a blessing.
1725,PHILOS AND LICIA.,And many times the wood nymph in a ring
1726,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Would girt the boy about, and being hemd in,"
1727,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Ere he get out, a kisse to each must giue,"
1728,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Or being so inchaind, so must he liue."
1729,PHILOS AND LICIA.,As thus the boy did often times resort
1730,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Vnto the woods to finde some friendly sport,"
1731,PHILOS AND LICIA.,One day amongst the rest he chanst to spie
1732,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"A virgin huntresse comming that way by,"
1733,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"With light thin garments tuckt vp to the knees,"
1734,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Buskins about her legs, through which he sees"
1735,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"A skin so white, that neuer did his eie"
1736,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Beholde so chaste, so pure, so sweet a die:"
1737,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Her vpper bodies when he did beholde,"
1738,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"They seemd all glistring to be made of gold,"
1739,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"But he perceiued, being somewhat nere,"
1740,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"It was the beautie of her dangling haire,"
1741,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Which from her head hung downe vnto her waste,"
1742,PHILOS AND LICIA.,And such a bright and orient colour cast.
1743,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"About her necke she ware a precious stone,"
1744,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"A high pris'd, matchlesse, sparkling diamond,"
1745,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"But poising it with her transpiercing eye,"
1746,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Shewd like a candle when the Sun is by.
1747,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"The louely boy was taken with the hooke,"
1748,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"The more he gazd, the more still was he strooke;"
1749,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"A thousand amourous glances he doth throwe,"
1750,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And those recoild, seconds a thousands moe."
1751,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"At last the boy being danted by her feature,"
1752,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Makes his speech prologue to so admir'd a creature:
1753,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Celestiall goddesse, sprung from heauenly race,"
1754,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"_Ioues_ sweetest offpring, shew me but what place"
1755,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Thou doest inhabit, where thy Temple stands,"
1756,PHILOS AND LICIA.,That I may offer with vnspotted hands
1757,PHILOS AND LICIA.,On thy deere Altar; and vpon thy praise
1758,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Sing glorious hymnes and sweet tun'd roundelays;
1759,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"But ô most happy if I were thy Priest,"
1760,PHILOS AND LICIA.,To celebrate thy vigils and thy feast.
1761,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"If it be _Paphos_ and thou loues sweet Queene,"
1762,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Rose cheekt _Adonis_ would that I had beene;
1763,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Or if nights gouernesse, the pale-fac'd Moone,"
1764,PHILOS AND LICIA.,For thy sake would I were _Endymion_:
1765,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"But if no goddesse, yet of heauenly birth,"
1766,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And not disdainst poore men that liue on earth,"
1767,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"If thou hast any Loue, would I were he,"
1768,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Or if thou wantst one, fix thy loue on me."
1769,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"With that she blusht, and smiling lookt vpon him;"
1770,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"But here she left: for _Philos_ comming in,"
1771,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Brake off her tale, and then they all deuise"
1772,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"For state and show, how they may solemnise"
1773,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Their nuptials: each minute seemes a day,"
1774,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Till the slow houres had stolne the night away:
1775,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"But morne being come, theres none can tell the blis"
1776,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"That they conceiu'd, without the like were his."
1777,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"The golden Sun did cherish vp the day,"
1778,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"And chas'd the foggie mists and slime away,"
1779,PHILOS AND LICIA.,And gentle _Zephyre_ with perfumed breath
1780,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Stealing the sweets from off the flowry earth,"
1781,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Doth mildly breathe among the enamord trees,"
1782,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Kissing their leafie locks, which like still seas"
1783,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Waue vp and downe: and on the sprigs there stood
1784,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"The feathred Quiristers of the shadowy wood,"
1785,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Warbling forth layes of piercing melodie,"
1786,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Measuring the dances of the wind-wau'd tree.
1787,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Swift-winged _Mercurie_ hearing the report
1788,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Of these same nuptials, trudg'd vnto the Court,"

1794,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Of the best feature and of perfect growth;
1795,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"He followed in a cloake of cloth of gold,"
1796,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Larded with pearles, with diamonds enrold;"
1797,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"His vpper vestment was cut out in starres,"

1801,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Next came the Bride, like to the Queene of light,"
1802,PHILOS AND LICIA.,Drawne by her dragons to adorne the night:
1803,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"When she is richly dect and all things on,"
1804,PHILOS AND LICIA.,"Going to court her sweet _Endymion_,"

1965,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,Contemne me as inconstant as the winde.
1966,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Then shoot (quoth she) and strike them so in loue,"
1967,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"As nought but death, their loue-dart may remoue."
1968,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"At this he lookt, the boy was loth to shoot,"
1969,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Yet strucke them both so neere the hearts sweet root,"
1970,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,As that he made them both at once to cry
1971,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"(Quoth he) I loue, for loue (quoth she) I die."
1972,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Of this both _Venus_, and her blind boy bosted,"
1973,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,And thence to _Paphos_ Isle in triumph posted.

1977,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,
1978,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Now was the time, when shepheards told their sheep,"
1979,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And weary plow-men ease themselues with sleepe,"
1980,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"When loue-prickt _Thisbe_ no where could be found,"
1981,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Nor _Pyramus_, though seruants sought them round."
1982,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"But newes came straight, that _Pyramus_ was seene,"
1983,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,Sporting with _Thisbe_ lately in the euen:
1984,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,Like newes to both their Parents soone was brought;
1985,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,Which newes (alas) the louers downfals wrought.
1986,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"For though they lov'd, as you haue heard of yore,"
1987,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Their angry parents hate was ten times more,"
1988,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And hearing that their children were together,"
1989,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,Both were afraide least each had murthered other.

1995,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Their storming parents fround vpon them both,"
1996,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And charged them neuer so to meet againe,"
1997,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Which charge to them, God knows was endles paine:"
1998,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"For yeres came on, and true loue tooke such strength,"
1999,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,That they were welnigh slaine for loue at length:
2000,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"For though their parents houses ioynd in one,"
2001,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Yet they poore peats, were ioynd to liue alone."
2002,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"So great and deadly was the daring hate,"
2003,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Which kept their moody parents at debate,"
2004,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And yet their hearts as houses ioynd together,"
2005,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Though hard constraint, their bodies did disseuer."

2013,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Through this the louers did each other call,"
2014,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And often talke, but softly did they talke,"
2015,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,Least busie spy-faults should find out their walke:
2016,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"For it was plast in such a secret roome,"
2017,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,As thither did their parents seldome come.
2018,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Through this they kist, but with their breath they kist,"

2020,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Somtimes poor souls, they talkt till they were windles"
2021,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,And all their talke was of their friends vnkindnes.

2025,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,

2028,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"They did agree, but through the wall agreed,"
2029,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"That both should hast vnto the groue with speed,"

2033,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"_Thisbe_ prepar'd to get her forth the towne,"
2034,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"For well she wot, her loue would keepe his houre,"
2035,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,And be the first should come vnto the bowre:
2036,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"For _Pyramus_ had sworne there for to meete her,"
2037,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,And like to _Venus_ champion there to greet her.

2041,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,

2043,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,Till they enioyd the height of their desires:
2044,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Sought out all meanes they could to keep their vow,"
2045,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And steale away, and yet they knew not how."
2046,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,_Thisbe_ at last (yet of the two the first)

2057,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,

2060,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"The like wore _Venus_, _Venus_ robe was white,"
2061,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And so was _Thisbes_ not so faire to sight,"
2062,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Nor yet so fine, yet was it full as good,"
2063,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,Because it was not stain'd with true loues bloud.
2064,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"About her waste, she wore a scarfe of blew,"

2075,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"She went to purchase what true loue desyr'd,"
2076,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And as she trode vpon the tender grasse,"
2077,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,The grasse did kisse her feet as she did passe:
2078,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And when her feet against a floure did strike,"
2079,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,The bending floures did stoope to doe the like:
2080,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And when her feet did from the ground arise,"

2082,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Tread where she would, faire _Thisbe_ could not misse,"
2083,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,For euery grasse would rob her of a kisse.
2084,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And more the boughs wold bend, for ioy to meet her"
2085,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And chanting birds, with madrigals would greet her."

2094,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"They sware she was _Diana_, or more bright."
2095,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"For through the leauie boughs they tooke delight,"
2096,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,To view her daintie footing as she tript:
2097,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And once they smil'd, for once faire _Thisbe_ slipt,"
2098,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Yet though she slipt, she had so swift a pace,"
2099,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,As that her slipping wrought her no disgrace.
2100,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,For of the Nymphs (whose coy eyes did attend her)
2101,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Of all was none, of all that could amend her."

2109,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,Where (out alas) a woe chance did betide:
2110,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"For loue-adoring _Thisbe_ was so faire,"
2111,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,That bruitish beasts at her delighted are:
2112,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And from the rest as many beasts did rome,"
2113,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"A lamb deuouring Lion forth did come,"
2114,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And hauing lately torne a sillie Lambe,"
2115,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"The full gorg'd Lion sported as it came,"
2116,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"To him a sport, his sport made _Thisbe_ hie her,"
2117,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"For why, she durst not let the beast come nie her."

2119,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,
2120,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,18
2121,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,
2122,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Yet still it came, to welcome her it came,"
2123,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And not to hurt, yet fearefull is the name,"
2124,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"The name more then the Lion, her dismayd,"
2125,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,For in her lap the Lion would haue playd.
2126,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Nor meant the beast to spill her guilelesse bloud,"
2127,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Yet doubtfull _Thisbe_ in a fearefull moode,"
2128,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Let fall her mantle, made of purest white,"

2131,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Shee slipt, but quickely slipt into a groue,"
2132,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And lo a friendly Caue did entertaine her,"
2133,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,For feare the bloudy Lion should haue slaine her.
2134,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,
2135,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,
2136,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,19
2137,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,
2138,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"_Thisbe_ thus scap't, for thus she scap't his force,"
2139,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,Although (God wot) it fell out farther worse:
2140,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"The Lion came yet meant no harme at all,"
2141,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And comming found the mantle she let fall,"
2142,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Which now he kist, he would haue kist her too,"
2143,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,But that her nimble footmanship said no.
2144,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"He found the robe, which quickly he might find,"
2145,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"For being light, it houered in the winde:"
2146,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"VVith which the game-some Lion long did play,"
2147,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,Till hunger cald him thence to seeke his prey:
2148,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And hauing playd, for play was all his pleasure,"
2149,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"He left the mantle, _Thisbes_ chiefest treasure."

2152,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,20
2153,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,
2154,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Yet ere he left it, being in a mood,"
2155,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"He tore it much, and stain'd it ore with bloud,"
2156,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Which done, with rage he hasted to his prey,"
2157,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,For they in murther passe their time away.
2158,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And now time-telling, _Pyramus_ at last,"
2159,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,(For yet the houre of meeting was not past)
2160,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,Got forth (he would haue got away before)
2161,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,But fate and fortune sought to wrong him more:
2162,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"For euen that day, more fatall then the rest,"
2163,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"He needs must giue attendance at a feast,"
2164,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,Ere which was done (swift time was shrewdly wasted)

2171,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"_Thisbe_ he sought, faire _Thisbe_ found he not,"
2172,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,And yet at last her long loue robe he found
2173,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,All rent and torne vpon the bloody ground.
2174,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"At which suspicion told him she was dead,"
2175,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,And onely that remained in her stead:
2176,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Which made him weepe, like mothers, so wept he,"
2177,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,That with their eyes their murthered children see;
2178,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And gathering vp the limbes in peecemeale torne,"
2179,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,Of their deare burthen murtherously forlorne:
2180,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"So _Pyramus_ sicke thoughted like a mother,"
2181,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"For _Thisbes_ losse, more deare then any other."
2182,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,
2183,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,
2184,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,22
2185,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,
2186,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,Or who hath seene a mournefull Doe lament
2187,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"For her young Kid, in peecemeale torne and rent,"
2188,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And by the poore remainders sit and mourne,"
2189,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,For loue of that which (out alas) is gone?
2190,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Let him behold sad _Pyramus_, and say,"
2191,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Her losse, his loue, doth equall euery way."
2192,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"For as a man that late hath lost his wits,"
2193,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Breakes into fury and disaster fits,"
2194,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"So _Pyramus_ in griefe without compare,"
2195,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Doth rend his flesh, and teare his golden haire,"
2196,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Making the trees to tremble at his mourning,"
2197,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,And speechlesse beasts to sorrow with his groaning.

2201,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,
2202,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Alas (quoth he) and then he tore his flesh,"
2203,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Gone is the sunne that did my Zone refresh,"
2204,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Gone is the life, by which I wretch did liue,"
2205,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Gone is my heauen, which hopefull blisse did giue,"

2215,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,
2216,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,24
2217,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,
2218,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And then he cast his eyes vpon the ground,"
2219,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,And here and there where bloudie grasse he found;
2220,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Sweet bloud (quoth he) and then he kist the bloud,"
2221,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And yet that kisse God wot did little good,"
2222,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Couldst thou being powr'd into my halfe slaine brest,"

2227,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And looking grieu'd, and grieuing cryde alas,"
2228,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Where shall I hide this bloud of my deare louer,"
2229,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,That neither man nor beast may it discouer?
2230,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,
2231,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,
2232,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,25
2233,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,
2234,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Then in the mantle he the grasse vp tide,"
2235,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,And laid it close vnto his naked side:
2236,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Lie there (quoth he) deare to me as my hart,"
2237,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,Of which thy mistresse had the greater part.
2238,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Tut she is dead, and then he vow'd and swore,"
2239,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,He would not liue to murther loue no more:
2240,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Which spoke, he drew his Rapier from his side,"
2241,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Of which the loue-slaine youth would then haue dy'd,"
2242,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"But that he thought, that pennance too too small,"
2243,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,To pacifie faire _Thisbes_ Ghost withall:
2244,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Wherefore he rag'd, and ragingly exclaimed,"
2245,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"That he true loue, and true loue him had maimed."
2246,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,
2247,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,
2248,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,26
2249,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,
2250,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And then his Rapier vp againe he tooke,"
2251,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,Then on the mantle cast a grieuous looke.
2252,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"For me (quoth he) faire _Thisbe_ lost this bloud,"
2253,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"She dead, my life would doe me little good,"
2254,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,And well he thought he could endure the smart
2255,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Of death, and yet he could not harme his heart:"
2256,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"For why his hand being guiltlesse of the deed,"
2257,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Deny'd to make his harmelesse heart to bleed,"
2258,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And like a trembling executioner,"
2259,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Constrain'd to slay a guiltelesse prisoner,"
2260,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"His hand retired still, further backe and further,"
2261,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,As lothing to enact so vile a murther.
2262,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,
2263,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,
2264,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,27
2265,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,
2266,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"But _Pyramus_ like to a raging Iudge,"
2267,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Seeing his executioner flinch, and grudge"
2268,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"To do the duty he enioyn'd him do,"
2269,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Reply'd, dispatch, or Ile cut thee off too:"
2270,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"At which the trembling hand tooke vp the blade,"
2271,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"But when the second profer it had made,"
2272,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"It threw it downe, and boldly thus replyed,"
2273,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"He was not cause that louely _Thisbe_ dyed,"
2274,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Nor would I slay thee, knew I she were dead:"
2275,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,Then be the bloud vpon thy guiltie head.
2276,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Of these last words young _Pyramus_ dispences,"
2277,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,And cald a synodie of all his seuer'd sences.

2281,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,
2282,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"His conscience told him, he deserv'd not death,"
2283,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,For he deprav'd not _Thisbe_ of her breath:
2284,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"But then suspicion thought, he causd her dye,"
2285,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"But conscience swore, suspition told a lye."
2286,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"At this suspicion prompted loue in th'eare,"
2287,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And bad him shew his verdict, and come neare,"
2288,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Which soone he did, and fate among the rest,"
2289,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,As one whom _Pyramus_ esteemed best:
2290,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"For when proud Loue gaue in his faultie plea,"
2291,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"He askt if he were guiltie, Loue said yea,"
2292,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And with the youth, fond youth by loue entangled,"
2293,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,Agreed his guiltlesse body should be mangled.

2361,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,
2362,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Her sudden bleeding argued some mischance,"

2364,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"But of the Lion troubled _Thisbe_ thought,"
2365,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And then of him, whom fearefully she sought:"
2366,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Yet forth she went, replete with iealous feare,"
2367,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Still fearing, of the Lion was her feare:"
2368,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And if a bird but flew from forth a bush,"

2370,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Her nose left bleeding, that amaz'd her more"
2371,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,Then all the troublous feare she felt before:
2372,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"For sudden bleeding argues ill ensuing,"

2375,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,
2376,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,34
2377,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,
2378,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"By this she came into the open wood,"
2379,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Where _Pyramus_ had lost his dearest bloud,"
2380,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,And round about she rolles her sun bright eyes
2381,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"For _Pyramus_, whom no where she espies;"
2382,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Then forth she tript, and nearly too she tript,"
2383,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,And ouer hedges oft this virgin skipt.
2384,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Then did she crosse the fields, and new mown grasse,"
2385,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,To find the place whereas this arbour was:
2386,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"For it was seated in a pleasant shade,"
2387,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,And by the shepheards first this bowre was made.
2388,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Faire _Thisbe_ made more haste into the bower,"

2395,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"She found him not, which did augment her feare:"
2396,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,But straight she thought (as true loue thinks the best)
2397,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"He had beene laid downe in the shade to rest,"
2398,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Or of set purpose hidden in the reeds,"
2399,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"To make her seeke him in the sedgie weeds,"
2400,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"For so of children they had done before,"
2401,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,Which made her thoughts seeme true so much the more:
2402,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"But hauing sought whereas she thought he was,"
2403,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,Shee could not finde her _Pyramus_ (alas)
2404,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Wherefore she back return'd vnto the arbor,"
2405,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,And there reposd her after all her labor.

2413,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Thinking her heart from forth her brest was rent,"
2414,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"By her owne censure damn'd to cruell death,"
2415,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,And in her sight bereft of vitall breath.
2416,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"When she awak't, as long she had not slept,"
2417,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"She wept amaine, yet knew not why she wept:"
2418,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"For as before her heart was whole and sound,"
2419,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And no defect about her could be found,"
2420,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"She dreamt she hurt, no hurt could she discouer,"
2421,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,Wherefore she went to seeke her late lost louer.

2428,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"For lo, vpon the margent of the wood,"
2429,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"They spy'd her loue, lye weltring in his bloud,"
2430,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Hauing her late lost mantle at his side,"
2431,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Stained with bloud, his hart bloud was not dry'd."
2432,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"VVisty she lookt, and as she lookt did cry,"
2433,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"See, see, my hart, which I did iudge to dye:"
2434,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Poore hart (quoth she) and then she kist his brest,"
2435,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"VVert thou inclosd in mine, there shouldst thou rest:"
2436,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"I causd thee die poore heart, yet rue thy dying,"
2437,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And saw thy death, as I asleepe was lying."
2438,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,
2439,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,
2440,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,38
2441,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,
2442,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Thou art my hart, more deare then is mine owne,"
2443,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,And thee sad death in my false sleepe was showne:
2444,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And then she pluckt away the murtherous blade,"
2445,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And curst the hands by whom it first was made,"
2446,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And yet she kist his hand that held the same,"
2447,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,And double kist the wound from whence it came.
2448,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Him selfe was author of his death she knew,"
2449,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"For yet the wound was fresh, and bleeding new,"
2450,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And some bloud yet the ill-made wound did keepe,"
2451,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"VVhich when she saw, she freshly gan to weepe,"
2452,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And wash the wound with fresh tears down distilling,"
2453,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,And view'd the same (God wot) with eyes vnwilling.

2455,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,

2457,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,

2461,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"When speechlesse vp she tooke the bloudy sword,"
2462,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And then she cast a looke vpon her Loue,"
2463,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,Then to the blade her eye she did remoue.
2464,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And sobbing cride, since loue hath murthred thee,"

2476,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"Her fearefull bloud ran trickling to the ground,"
2477,TO THE WORSHIPFVLL,"And sought about, till _Pyramus_ it found:"

6260,OF,_Amos_ and _Laura_.
6261,OF,
6262,OF,
6263,OF,In the large confines of renowned _France_
6264,OF,"There liu'd a Lord, whom Fortune did aduance,"
6265,OF,"VVho had a Daughter, _Laura_ call'd the faire;"
6266,OF,"So sweet, so proper, and so debonaire,"
6267,OF,"That strangers tooke her for to be none other,"
6268,OF,"Then _Venus_ selfe, the God of _Loues_ owne Mother."
6269,OF,"Not farre from thence was scituate a Towne,"
6270,OF,The Lord thereof a man of great renowne;
6271,OF,"VVhom likewise Fortune blessed with a Sonne,"
6272,OF,"_Amos_ by name, so modest, ciuill, yong,"
6273,OF,"And yet in sight so wondrous and so bold,"
6274,OF,As that therein he passed vncontroul'd:
6275,OF,"So kinde to strangers, and so meeke to all;"
6276,OF,"Of comely grace, and stature somewhat tall."
6277,OF,"As the wide world not two such Impes affords,"
6278,OF,As were the off-springs of these happy Lords.
6279,OF,"Hunting he lou'd, and therefore in a morne"
6280,OF,He shakes off sleepe (for ease he laughes to scorne)
6281,OF,Before the sable Curtaines of the East
6282,OF,Proclaim'd the Sunnes approach vnto the west;
6283,OF,"Or _Tytan_, Lordly Ruler of the morne,"
6284,OF,"Had in his Chariot, left the night forlorne;"
6285,OF,"Or sounded sleepe to them, with whom (men say)"
6286,OF,It's darksome night when we enioy the day:
6287,OF,"He brac'd his Hounds, and striding o'er his Steed,"
6288,OF,Hope with a conquest did the youngster feed:
6289,OF,"VVhich done, he hyes him to a mighty wood,"
6290,OF,That ioyn'd where _Laura's_ Fathers Pallace stood.
6291,OF,"Thither being come, a Bore he rais'd, whose pace"
6292,OF,Did make our hunts-man loose his Hounds in chase:
6293,OF,"Ranging the woods, he light into a Groue,"
6294,OF,More pleasant farre then that where _Venus_ stroue
6295,OF,"To win _Adonis_ to her hearts desire,"
6296,OF,Moued by the burning zeale of sweet _Loues_ fire.
6297,OF,"In this sweet Groue God _Pan_ did keepe his Court,"
6298,OF,"And summon'd all the petty Gods resort,"
6299,OF,"As Satyres, Nymphes, and others, to the same,"
6300,OF,VVhere all sing prayses vnto _Laura's_ name.
6301,OF,Into this Groue (neare to her chamber side)
6302,OF,(To take the Ayre) she comes forth; soone espide
6303,OF,"Of the yong Hunts-man, who made haste vnto her,"
6304,OF,And thus the Nouice there beginnes to wooe her:
6305,OF,"Parragon of beauty, diuine, though earthly creature,"
6306,OF,And yet Celestiall in thy heauenly feature.
6307,OF,"This sodaine courting, and vnwelcome sight,"
6308,OF,"Made her adde wings to feare, and to that, flight:"
6309,OF,"He following after, caught her by the traine,"
6310,OF,"That in a rage the Maide turn'd backe againe,"
6311,OF,"And did demaund why he without remorse,"
6312,OF,"Durst cause her stay, against her will, by force."
6313,OF,"Mou'd by the rosiate colour of thy face,"
6314,OF,(VVherein consists (quoth he) all heauenly grace)
6315,OF,"I was too bold, I must confesse indeede,"
6316,OF,To touch the seluage of thy sacred weede:
6317,OF,"For which my selfe Ile punish as thou wilt,"
6318,OF,"VVith any paine, for my deserued guilt."
6319,OF,"Doe but pronounce the sentence of my death,"
6320,OF,These hands shall be the butchers of my breath:
6321,OF,"But since the merit of my fault's no deeper,"
6322,OF,"Oh let me be thy Prisoner, thou my Keeper;"
6323,OF,"So shall thine eyes be witnesse of the woe,"
6324,OF,VVhich for my bold offence Ile vndergoe.
6325,OF,"Pronounce thy sentence then. VVherwith she spake,"
6326,OF,You are your Crafts-man Sir: and there she brake.
6327,OF,"Yet turning backe, quoth she, ô would 'twere true,"
6328,OF,"Your loue were firme to me, as mine to you!"
6329,OF,"And here she ceased: for when he came neare her,"
6330,OF,She was afraid that he would ouer-heare her.
6331,OF,"And art thou so vnwilling then, quoth hee,"
6332,OF,To doome the sentence which I aske of thee?
6333,OF,Perswade thy selfe it is thy purer minde
6334,OF,That will not let thy heart proue so vnkinde:
6335,OF,"O would that minde were mine, to ioyne thy hart"
6336,OF,"Eyther to end my life, or ease my smart."
6337,OF,"Loue is my sute. Nor hate is my reply,"
6338,OF,"Quoth she. Quoth hee, I cannot court it I;"
6339,OF,"They which but view the error in my lookes,"
6340,OF,May finde I neuer learn'd in _Cupids_ bookes:
6341,OF,"But like a stone rough hewen from the rockes,"
6342,OF,"And after polish'd by the Masons knockes,"
6343,OF,"The former shewes but base then in compare,"
6344,OF,So to my loue my speech disgraces are:
6345,OF,"For were my speech true patterne of my minde,"
6346,OF,"Not as it doth, should't come, but farre more kinde,"
6347,OF,"Like as the Marchant hearing of a losse,"
6348,OF,Is vvondrous sory for so great a crosse;
6349,OF,"And after heareth by a true report,"
6350,OF,"His goods are safely landed in the Fort,"
6351,OF,Cannot expresse the joy he doth conceiue:
6352,OF,For why? it doth his senses quite bereaue;
6353,OF,"And yet with signe of sorrow blames th'euent,"
6354,OF,Although it seeme most plaine and euident.
6355,OF,"Or like a Ship toss'd by tempestuous weather,"
6356,OF,"Now here, then there; now back againe, then thither"
6357,OF,That whirle-windes meeting (roaring out aloud)
6358,OF,Make watry mountaines shew the ship each cloud:
6359,OF,"Then with such fury they descend the deepe,"
6360,OF,"From top of triple-Cedar-mountaines steepe,"
6361,OF,"As of the Seas rich orientall shew,"
6362,OF,Against their wils they take a counterview.
6363,OF,"So fares his minde, which tossed to and fro,"
6364,OF,"Sometimes doth ioy, and other times is woe:"
6365,OF,"Sometimes from depth ascends into the ayre,"
6366,OF,"And though he hope, he hides it with despayre."
6367,OF,"So long with feruent zeale he mou'd his sute,"
6368,OF,Onely for want of words his tongue was mute.
6369,OF,"""VVhere true affection rules in hottest fires,"
6370,OF,"""Dumbe signes and tokens then shew mens desires:"
6371,OF,"For what he thought he shew'd, he could not vtter,"
6372,OF,_W_hich made him oft when he shold speak to mutter.
6373,OF,"She that was wounded with the selfe-same dart,"
6374,OF,Reueal'd with tongue that which she wisht with hart
6375,OF,"And fram'd her answere, so much't could not grieue him,"
6376,OF,For 'twas a salue to wound and to relieue him.
6377,OF,"Say I could loue, quoth she, my milder minde,"
6378,OF,"(Vnlesse you further moue) cannot vnkinde,"
6379,OF,Frame you an answere: for wee are by nature
6380,OF,"So much addicted to mans heauenly feature,"
6381,OF,"That though your faults are great by your abuse,"
6382,OF,To blinde the same it is our womans vse.
6383,OF,"Then as thou found'st me, leaue me, if thou wilt;"
6384,OF,That shall be all I render for thy guilt.
6385,OF,Further I will not credit thy report:
6386,OF,"Farewell; be gone, for I am mist in Court."
6387,OF,"With that shee flyes, and in her flight she leaues"
6388,OF,"A well wrought Scarfe, which straight the winde vp heaues;"
6389,OF,"And proud of such a prise, they doe infer"
6390,OF,"With their embassage vnto _Jupiter_,"
6391,OF,"And there presented it: who, as 'twas right,"
6392,OF,"Did make the windes returne't with swiftest flight,"
6393,OF,Vnto the place where _Amos_ stood amazed
6394,OF,"At that which hapt, who like a mad-man gazed,"
6395,OF,"Wondring what she by this illusion meant,"
6396,OF,When to allure him was her whole intent:
6397,OF,"But led in admiration most of all,"
6398,OF,At the rich Scarfe which from the Maide did fall.
6399,OF,"He viewes the worke, where finding of _Apollo_"
6400,OF,"Chasing a Nymph, who swifter then a Swallow"
6401,OF,"Flyeth his armes, for feare did lend her wings"
6402,OF,To flye from him which after her soone flings.
6403,OF,"Himselfe a foole he cals, that wanting skill,"
6404,OF,"Being allur'd, he had not knowne her will."
6405,OF,"Doubtfull, he feares offence committed to her,"
6406,OF,"That he so rashly, gain'st her will, durst wooe her."
6407,OF,"To cleare himselfe of which offence he flyes,"
6408,OF,"Resolu'd to winne the Maide, or lose the prize,"
6409,OF,"With prosperous hast. Oh may thy hast well speed,"
6410,OF,Whose wondrous loue did vertuously proceed:
6411,OF,"Not from the flames of filthy lusts desire,"
6412,OF,As was that Rome-borne _Tarquins_ lustfull fire:
6413,OF,"But as vnspotlesse from that filthy thought,"
6414,OF,"From that most hell-deseruing thing of nought,"
6415,OF,"As euer heart lodg'd in a loyall brest,"
6416,OF,"Or tongue, vntaught to lye, euer exprest."
6417,OF,"But why doe I digresse the path I tread,"
6418,OF,Cloying your eares with that your eyes doe read?
6419,OF,"Pardon my boldnesse, and giue eare a while"
6420,OF,"To that, of him, which my inferiour stile"
6421,OF,"Shall now expresse: though't not with honor stands,"
6422,OF,He thinkes one paire of legs worth twice two hands.
6423,OF,"The arrow swift sent from the sturdy bow,"
6424,OF,May be accounted (to his flight) but slow:
6425,OF,"At last he gain'd the Court, to vvhich being come,"
6426,OF,It shew'd like to the Pallace of the Sunne
6427,OF,"Describ'd in _Ouid_: for in length and fairenesse,"
6428,OF,None might surpasse the workmanship and rarenes.
6429,OF,"Through which his way lies, & he needs must passe,"
6430,OF,"The pauement Marble vvas, the vvals of Glasse:"
6431,OF,VVhereunder vvas so liuely caru'd the Story
6432,OF,"Of great _Joues_ loue, his vvondrous vvorks, & glory,"
6433,OF,VVith many others loue: vvhich to rehearse
6434,OF,"VVould adde a mighty volume to my Verse,"
6435,OF,"Besides mine owne weake vvit: for I doe know it,"
6436,OF,"He vvas a better workeman, then I Poet."
6437,OF,Yet could not this abate the Louers pace:
6438,OF,For he still holds the louely Maide in chase.
6439,OF,"Passing the Court, he comes into a greene,"
6440,OF,VVhich vvas in middest of the Pallace seene:
6441,OF,"Thorough the midst there ranne a pleasant Spring,"
6442,OF,"On each side with a vvall of Bricke hemm'd in,"
6443,OF,"Onely in midst, a Stile; beyond, a Plancke,"
6444,OF,VVhich for a Bridge did serue to eyther bancke.
6445,OF,"Ouer this Stile as _Laura_ lightly skips,"
6446,OF,"In her rent garment happily it slips,"
6447,OF,"And held her there a while till hee came to her,"
6448,OF,VVhere once againe the Nouice gins to wwoe her.
6449,OF,"Flye not thy friend, our Maker vvilleth so,"
6450,OF,"Things reasonlesse approue and vvish it so,"
6451,OF,If vvithout sense and reason all things then
6452,OF,"Obserue a better course then humane men,"
6453,OF,"How sauage were we then offending so,"
6454,OF,Committing that vvhich vve offence doe know?
6455,OF,"O were my tongue a second _Orpheus_ Harpe,"
6456,OF,That to my loue I might allure thy heart!
6457,OF,"Or vvere thy loue but equall vnto mine,"
6458,OF,Then vvould thou seeke his fauor vvho seeks thine!
6459,OF,"Me thinkes vnkindnesse cannot come from thence,"
6460,OF,"VVhere beauty raignes vvith such magnificence,"
6461,OF,"I meane from thee, vvhom nature hath endow'd"
6462,OF,VVith more then Art would vvillingly allow'd:
6463,OF,"And though by nature you are borne most faire,"
6464,OF,Yet Art would adde a beautie to your share:
6465,OF,But it being spotlesse doth disdaine receipt
6466,OF,Of all vnpolish'd painting counterfeit.
6467,OF,"Your beautie is a snare vnto our wayes,"
6468,OF,"VVherein once caught, wee cannot brooke delayes;"
6469,OF,"VVhich makes vs oft through griefe of minde grow sad,"
6470,OF,"Griefe follows grief, then malecontent & mad."
6471,OF,"Thus by deniall doe you cause our woe,"
6472,OF,And then doe triumph in our ouer-throw.
6473,OF,"What is it to be fayre? onely a vanitie,"
6474,OF,A fading blossome of no perpetuitie.
6475,OF,"Consider this: for beautie is a flower,"
6476,OF,Subiect to ill occasions euery hower;
6477,OF,It is a tenure holden as wee see
6478,OF,"_Durante Dei placito_, not in fee."
6479,OF,"Measure my Loue then, proue it by a tryall:"
6480,OF,Let me not languish still by your deniall.
6481,OF,"If in my suite I erre, as by mischance,"
6482,OF,Blame not my Loue but count it ignorance.
6483,OF,"The tongue is but an instrument of nought,"
6484,OF,And cannot speake the largenesse of the thought:
6485,OF,"For when the minde abounds, and almost breaketh,"
6486,OF,Then through abundance of the heart it speaketh:
6487,OF,"No man can speake but what he hath in minde,"
6488,OF,Then what I speake I thinke; be not vnkinde
6489,OF,"Vnto your seruant, who obedience proffers,"
6490,OF,And makes firme loue the obiect of his offers.
6491,OF,"I will not boast of Parentage, or Lyne,"
6492,OF,"For all are base, respecting thee diuine:"
6493,OF,"Nor will I boast of wealth, or riches store,"
6494,OF,"For in thy face consists all wealth, and more."
6495,OF,"Pure are my thoughts as skin betweene thy browes,"
6496,OF,"And eke as chaste my speech, my oathes, & vowes."
6497,OF,"Speake sweetest fayre, but one kinde word to me,"
6498,OF,How can alas that be offence in thee?
6499,OF,"There was a Dame a moderne Poet sung,"
6500,OF,"_Hero_ by name, like thee, both faire and young:"
6501,OF,"And both so faire, that you did others passe"
6502,OF,As farre as rarest Dyamonds common glasse.
6503,OF,"VVhom young _Leander_ courted on a greene,"
6504,OF,A Maide so faire (but thee) was neuer seene.
6505,OF,"She granted loue, which he (alas) to gaine,"
6506,OF,"To reape those ioyes, did crosse the brinish Maine."
6507,OF,"My loue to thee, I now compare to his;"
6508,OF,"Accounting danger, so requited, blisse."
6509,OF,"There are no Seas to separate our ioy,"
6510,OF,No future danger can our Loue annoy:
6511,OF,Then grant to me what she denide not him;
6512,OF,"If good in her, in thee it is no sinne."
6513,OF,"The Sunne hath shin'd thus long, ô let not now"
6514,OF,The Sunne be darkened by thine angry brow.
6515,OF,But rather let each looke a Comet be
6516,OF,That may presage my happy destinie.
6517,OF,"I could to you a short discourse impart,"
6518,OF,"That would relent the direst stony hart,"
6519,OF,VVer't not offence. It's no offence quoth she.
6520,OF,"Then thus the same Ile briefely tell, quoth he:"
6521,OF,"A poore old man by chance did breake his leg,"
6522,OF,"And he was told where he was wont to beg,"
6523,OF,"That such a Surgion (telling of his name,)"
6524,OF,"If that he pleas'd, could quickly cure the same."
6525,OF,"VVhich when he heard, to him for helpe he goes,"
6526,OF,And craues for Gods sake he would ease his woes.
6527,OF,"The Surgion greedy to haue coyne therefore,"
6528,OF,"But finding none, he would not heale the sore:"
6529,OF,"VVhich caus'd the poore old man to keepe his bed,"
6530,OF,That he for want of helpe in time was dead.
6531,OF,Alas poore soule; (quoth shee) and did he dye?
6532,OF,"VVould I were Iudge, or hee were such as I,"
6533,OF,"I so would vse the Surgion, as that hee"
6534,OF,Should feele the griefe which he before did see.
6535,OF,"Thus you confesse your wrong to me sweet Maid,"
6536,OF,If you performe (quoth he) the vvords you said.
6537,OF,"I am the man, who wounded, seeke reliefe:"
6538,OF,"And you, the causer of my endlesse griefe;"
6539,OF,"You are the Surgion, whom I vrge the more"
6540,OF,To cure the wound because you made the sore.
6541,OF,"Be not obdurate then, sith my disease"
6542,OF,"Is quickly cured, if the Surgion please."
6543,OF,"And this I vow, water shall turne to fire,"
6544,OF,Huge massie mountaines to the clouds aspire;
6545,OF,"The Sun shall leaue his course, the Moon her brightnes,"
6546,OF,"Night turne to day, and day shall lose his lightnes;"
6547,OF,"Fishes shall flye, birds swimme; and Hare shall hunt"
6548,OF,"The Hound, which to pursue the Hare vvas wont:"
6549,OF,"Ayre, Earth, Fire, VVater, all things which you view"
6550,OF,"Shall change their natures, ere I turne from you:"
6551,OF,"And longer then I breathe a loyall friend,"
6552,OF,Let me (ô heauens) endure a wicked end.
6553,OF,"Silence (quoth she) and here let cease thy sute,"
6554,OF,Cause of distrust in loue did make me mute:
6555,OF,"Aske why I yeelded in so short a season,"
6556,OF,"Because I loue, that is a womans reason."
6557,OF,"Yet Maides are fearefull; for by mens abuse,"
6558,OF,"Courting is turned to a common vse,"
6559,OF,"How is he held, that cannot in these dayes"
6560,OF,Fash'on his words to each fantasticke phrase?
6561,OF,VVhich makes vs oft with one word to debase
6562,OF,"Him from our bosomes, whom our hearts imbrace:"
6563,OF,"And, as you men doe for a Prouerbe make it,"
6564,OF,That which we loue we oft say nay and take it.
6565,OF,"Delayes breede danger, wherefore what I said,"
6566,OF,"And what agrees with Honour, and a Maid,"
6567,OF,"I yeeld to thee, but yet on this condition,"
6568,OF,Thou shalt not dare t'attempt the least fruition
6569,OF,"Of my chaste thoughts, by drawing them aside,"
6570,OF,Before in wedlocke I am made thy Bride.
6571,OF,"This said; shee to the Court, hee to his Hounds,"
6572,OF,"_W_here they had slaine a Bore, whose bloud abounds:"
6573,OF,"Glad of his prey, he hastneth home amaine,"
6574,OF,"VVith short returne he comes to her againe,"
6575,OF,"And hauing ioyn'd themselues in _Hymens_ bands,"
6576,OF,The sacred Priest vniteth heart and hands:
6577,OF,"They reape those ioyes which elder louers know,"
6578,OF,"And thus my Tale doth end, thus ends their woe."

6633,_LONDON_,"You that haue parents, or that parents be,"

6642,_LONDON_,From those that such incestious people had:

6651,_LONDON_,"And as this shamefull matter wanted grace,"

6653,_LONDON_,
6654,_LONDON_,Why should not Gods this loue of mine permit?

6720,_LONDON_,"Thy fathers loue, that blazons on thy shame."
6721,_LONDON_,Yet put the case he first did seeke to me;

6723,_LONDON_,
6724,_LONDON_,"Why should it not then stand right so with him,"
6725,_LONDON_,Since of one nature we participate?
6726,_LONDON_,What if with speech thou chance his loue to win

6728,_LONDON_,"What thou dost blush to speake, loue bids thee write"
6729,_LONDON_,Belieue me they read more th[=e] we indite.

6737,_LONDON_,
6738,_LONDON_,"She casts away, and doth begin anew,"
6739,_LONDON_,Yet findes a want in that she framed last
6740,_LONDON_,"She blots, & then againe that thing doth view,"
6741,_LONDON_,And now the first more fits then all that's past.
6742,_LONDON_,"Father she writes, yet shame did blot it out,"
6743,_LONDON_,"Then thus she writes, and casts away all doubt."
6744,_LONDON_,
6745,_LONDON_,"I know not what, sends to I know not whom"
6746,_LONDON_,"Such health that thou maist only giue to me,"
6747,_LONDON_,"Which if I want, my life cannot be long,"
6748,_LONDON_,Euen that same health thy louer sends to thee.
6749,_LONDON_,"I dare not tell thee who I am for shame,"
6750,_LONDON_,Nor (out alasse) once let thee heare my name.
6751,_LONDON_,
6752,_LONDON_,"And if thou aske of me what I desire,"
6753,_LONDON_,"Or why so doubtfull I do write to thee,"

6755,_LONDON_,Till that my sweet were granted vnto me:
6756,_LONDON_,"Which if to know, thou wouldst make further triall"
6757,_LONDON_,A maiden asketh but a maids deniall.
6758,_LONDON_,
6759,_LONDON_,"In token of my wounded heart, I would"

6761,_LONDON_,"My colour pale, my body leane and cold,"
6762,_LONDON_,"My watery eyes, my sighes and heauy cheere,"
6763,_LONDON_,"Then mightst perceiue I were in loue with thee,"
6764,_LONDON_,And how the flames of loue tormenteth me.
6765,_LONDON_,
6766,_LONDON_,I call the Gods as witnesse to the same
6767,_LONDON_,"Poore wretched wench, I stroue to flie the dart"
6768,_LONDON_,And did my best that out-rage for to tame
6769,_LONDON_,"Which _Cupid_ had alotted for my smart,"
6770,_LONDON_,"No wench bare more then did to me betide,"
6771,_LONDON_,Which forc'd me shew the cause that I would hide.
6772,_LONDON_,
6773,_LONDON_,"Then mercy at thy gentle hands I craue,"
6774,_LONDON_,"In fearefull wise to thee I make my mone,"
6775,_LONDON_,"Thou onely maist thy louer spill or saue,"
6776,_LONDON_,"No enemy doth sue, but such a one"
6777,_LONDON_,"That is aly'd most sweetly vnto thee,"
6778,_LONDON_,Yet in a neerer band would linked be.
6779,_LONDON_,
6780,_LONDON_,"My life is thine, and thou didst giue it me,"
6781,_LONDON_,"Then loue thy selfe and thou wilt me affect,"
6782,_LONDON_,"My beauty's much, and is deriu'd from thee,"
6783,_LONDON_,Then all thy owne be carefull to respect.
6784,_LONDON_,"O stop thy eares, and heare not _Myrha's_ name,"
6785,_LONDON_,And shut thy eies wh[=e] thou dost read the same.
6786,_LONDON_,
6787,_LONDON_,"My youthfull yeares rash folly doth beseeme,"
6788,_LONDON_,"The skill of law to aged folkes belong,"
6789,_LONDON_,"And all is lawfull that we list, I deeme,"
6790,_LONDON_,"We take no notice of the right or wrong,"
6791,_LONDON_,"If it offend to take thy owne in't bed,"
6792,_LONDON_,Let that offence be layd vpon my head.
6793,_LONDON_,
6794,_LONDON_,"Then set apart the dread of worldly shame,"
6795,_LONDON_,"And take the Gods, as presidents herein,"
6796,_LONDON_,"My pregnant wit shall shun all future blame,"
6797,_LONDON_,"Our pleasure scapes wel, hid with name of kin,"
6798,_LONDON_,"And you may clip and kisse, and play with me,"
6799,_LONDON_,A daughters name me thinkes a cloke wil bee.
6800,_LONDON_,
6801,_LONDON_,"Haue mercy now, I haue my case exprest,"
6802,_LONDON_,Which loue inforst my fearefull hand to write:
6803,_LONDON_,"O grant thy daughter this her first request,"
6804,_LONDON_,"That is the occasion of her chiefe delight,"
6805,_LONDON_,"This Epitaph deserue thou not; I haue,"
6806,_LONDON_,The cruel father tooke the life he gaue.
6807,_LONDON_,
6808,_LONDON_,"And though my lines are blotted euery where,"
6809,_LONDON_,"'Twas with my teares that fell ere it was dry,"
6810,_LONDON_,"And if my letters scribled do appeare,"
6811,_LONDON_,Whereby you thinke some other wrot to try
6812,_LONDON_,"Your mind: because my curious hand is mist,"
6813,_LONDON_,"A fearefull minde, doth bring a shaking fist."
6814,_LONDON_,
6815,_LONDON_,And so these scrambled lines I do commend
6816,_LONDON_,"Vnto your loue, be-blurred all with teares,"
6817,_LONDON_,"With feruent hope they shall no whit offend,"
6818,_LONDON_,"The minde is base, that stil continuall feares."
6819,_LONDON_,"And note you which is the greater blot,"
6820,_LONDON_,To get no childe or kill that you haue got.
6821,_LONDON_,
6822,_LONDON_,"Thus much this lustfull Lady writ in vaine,"
6823,_LONDON_,"And seald it closely with a precious stone,"
6824,_LONDON_,"A precious stone clos'd vp a filthy staine,"
6825,_LONDON_,"Her trusty seruant forth she cals anone,"
6826,_LONDON_,"And blushing bad him with a merry cheare,"
6827,_LONDON_,He should this letter to her father beare.
6828,_LONDON_,
6829,_LONDON_,"This scarcely said, old _Cynaras_ did come,"
6830,_LONDON_,And then she cast her letter quite aside.
6831,_LONDON_,Daughter (said he) you see the daily throng
6832,_LONDON_,Of suters that do seeke thee for their bride:
6833,_LONDON_,"Here be their names _my wench_, th[=e] come & show"
6834,_LONDON_,On which of them thou wilt thy selfe bestow.
6835,_LONDON_,
6836,_LONDON_,"Now for a space she silent did remaine,"
6837,_LONDON_,And onely gazed wishly in his face:
6838,_LONDON_,"She could her teares no longer then restraine,"
6839,_LONDON_,But they ran trickling down her cheeks apace
6840,_LONDON_,"Her father kisses her, and bids her peace,"
6841,_LONDON_,And thought it tender-hearted shamefastnes.
6842,_LONDON_,
6843,_LONDON_,"He dry'd her cheekes, and said, my wench be stil,"
6844,_LONDON_,"Thy yeares of right, a husband now doth claime"
6845,_LONDON_,"Thou shalt not liue a maid by my good will,"
6846,_LONDON_,"Nor longer shalt a wanton bed refraine,"
6847,_LONDON_,"Then what, or who wilt haue? come tell me now."
6848,_LONDON_,At length she did reply; one like to you.
6849,_LONDON_,
6850,_LONDON_,"He did allow the choyce, and praisd the same,"
6851,_LONDON_,"And kist and clipt her for her louing speech,"
6852,_LONDON_,"Not deeming that it tended to their shame,"
6853,_LONDON_,"It pleasd her well, & wisht that he would seech"
6854,_LONDON_,"A further suit; and then made this request,"
6855,_LONDON_,"Let me live still with you, let wooers rest."
6856,_LONDON_,
6857,_LONDON_,"Your company I most of all affect,"
6858,_LONDON_,"Continue but your loue, it shall suffice,"
6859,_LONDON_,These wrangling husbands why should I respect?
6860,_LONDON_,"Her father thus againe to her replies,"
6861,_LONDON_,Thy godlinesse (at which she blushed red)
6862,_LONDON_,"I like, but thou must tast a Bride-groomes bed."
6863,_LONDON_,
6864,_LONDON_,"Thou dost not know the pleasure it affords,"
6865,_LONDON_,Nor wanton motions that therein abound.
6866,_LONDON_,"It not consisteth all of pleasant words,"
6867,_LONDON_,More gamesome tricks are there stil to be fo[=u]d
6868,_LONDON_,A minde so chaste as thine cannot conceiue
6869,_LONDON_,What pleasing sports one shall therby receiue.
6870,_LONDON_,
6871,_LONDON_,"It is no dreame, nor passion of the minde,"
6872,_LONDON_,"But a substantiall pleasure there doth dwell,"
6873,_LONDON_,"The practike part of dreames therein we finde,"
6874,_LONDON_,"Which who so doth omit, leades Apes in hell."
6875,_LONDON_,"Why dost thou blush? I know your case, belieue,"
6876,_LONDON_,"Maids must say nay, yet take when men do giue."
6877,_LONDON_,
6878,_LONDON_,"And now the sable horses of the night,"
6879,_LONDON_,"Haue drawne a mantle ore the siluer sky,"
6880,_LONDON_,"And all the stars doe shew their borrowed light,"
6881,_LONDON_,Each breathing thing oprest with sleep doth ly
6882,_LONDON_,"Saue _Philomell_, that sings of _Terreus_ rape,"
6883,_LONDON_,And _Myrha_ plotting some incestious scape.
6884,_LONDON_,
6885,_LONDON_,"No rest at all she tooke within her bed,"
6886,_LONDON_,"The flames of _Cupid_ burnt so in her brest,"
6887,_LONDON_,"And many a fansie comes into her head,"
6888,_LONDON_,"Which ouer-much her troubled soule opprest,"
6889,_LONDON_,"She _doubts_, she _hopes_ th[=e] _feare_ doth make repaire,"
6890,_LONDON_,"Sh'l now att[=e]pt, then _shame_ doth bring despaire."
6891,_LONDON_,
6892,_LONDON_,Looke how you see a pleasant field of Corne
6893,_LONDON_,"Moue here & there by gentle-breathing wind,"
6894,_LONDON_,"Now vp and downe, as waues in sea are borne:"
6895,_LONDON_,So doubtfull thoughts had motion in her mind:
6896,_LONDON_,"Now shee'l surcease, and now to him repaire"
6897,_LONDON_,"Instable, like a feather in the aire."
6898,_LONDON_,
6899,_LONDON_,"O fye vpon this fowle incestious lust,"
6900,_LONDON_,"That very Nature greatly doth abhorre,"
6901,_LONDON_,"Some plague will fall vpon all such I trust,"
6902,_LONDON_,If in this world there can be any more.
6903,_LONDON_,I hope this little world well free-ed is
6904,_LONDON_,"Of Giants, and such monstrous beasts as this."
6905,_LONDON_,
6906,_LONDON_,"So God preserue it, if it be his will,"
6907,_LONDON_,"And let the Gospell euer flourish here,"
6908,_LONDON_,"Yet I do feare we haue some yet as ill,"
6909,_LONDON_,The pleasing fooles do with their folly beare:
6910,_LONDON_,"In Paradice I see wee cannot live,"
6911,_LONDON_,But we shall finde some foule seducing _Eue_.
6912,_LONDON_,
6913,_LONDON_,"My tongue doth stagger to repeate her name,"
6914,_LONDON_,"So foule a blot a Christian cannot brooke,"
6915,_LONDON_,"Go seeke a glasse to see this filthy shame,"
6916,_LONDON_,Upon _Gods holy Bible_ daily looke:
6917,_LONDON_,"And there thou maist, as in a mirror see,"
6918,_LONDON_,No _Alkeron_ can yeeld the like to thee.
6919,_LONDON_,
6920,_LONDON_,"There sucke the _Nectar_ of his _Holy Word_,"
6921,_LONDON_,"And begge thou pardon for thy foule abuse,"
6922,_LONDON_,For euery _Sore_ it can a _Salue_ afford.
6923,_LONDON_,O _Atheist_! learne to make of it good use.
6924,_LONDON_,"Thou Christians blot, to leaue off further talke,"
6925,_LONDON_,"Whilst thou hast light, endeuor there to walke."
6926,_LONDON_,
6927,_LONDON_,"And thou _Pænchaia_, rich in manys a thing,"
6928,_LONDON_,"In _Custus_, _Cynamon_ and _Incense_ sweete,"
6929,_LONDON_,"That out of trees aboundantly doth spring,"
6930,_LONDON_,"Of _Ammonie_, and things for vses meete."
6931,_LONDON_,"Yet whilst thou yeeldest _Myrrh_, I wey thee not:"
6932,_LONDON_,For thereunto hath _Myrha_ giuen a blot.
6933,_LONDON_,
6934,_LONDON_,No measure in her filthy loue she found:
6935,_LONDON_,"No ease, no rest, but death doth like her now."
6936,_LONDON_,"Resolu'd on this she gets vp from the ground,"
6937,_LONDON_,"And mindes to hang her selfe, her loue to shew,"
6938,_LONDON_,"And then the noose about her necke she drawes,"
6939,_LONDON_,"And said, ô _Cynaras!_ thou art the onely cause."
6940,_LONDON_,
6941,_LONDON_,"Farewell therfor, a thousand times farewell,"
6942,_LONDON_,"Deere _Cynaras_ thou mightst haue sau'd my life,"
6943,_LONDON_,"And thinke then, this to me alone befell,"
6944,_LONDON_,Because I durst not loue thee as a wife.
6945,_LONDON_,Farewell againe. Oh welcome gentle death!
6946,_LONDON_,And then she went about to stop her breath.
6947,_LONDON_,
6948,_LONDON_,"A recompence fit for so foule a mind,"
6949,_LONDON_,But yet by chance her aged Nurse did lye
6950,_LONDON_,"Within a chamber that to hers adioyn'd,"
6951,_LONDON_,"Who ouer-hearing this, to her did hye;"
6952,_LONDON_,"And seeing her halfe murdered, so began"
6953,_LONDON_,"To shrieke & screeme, & straight vnto her ran."
6954,_LONDON_,
6955,_LONDON_,"Who first did snatch her girdle from her necke,"
6956,_LONDON_,"And powring teares vpon her plentuously,"
6957,_LONDON_,"Did hold her in her aged armes, though weake,"
6958,_LONDON_,And kissing her did vrge the reason why
6959,_LONDON_,"She went about away herselfe to make,"
6960,_LONDON_,Or to her shame so base a course to take?
6961,_LONDON_,
6962,_LONDON_,"Quoth she, I pray thee tell the cause to me,"
6963,_LONDON_,"Behold these empty dugs, and head all gray,"
6964,_LONDON_,These hands that pain haue took in rocking thee
6965,_LONDON_,"Let some, or all these, cause thee to bewray"
6966,_LONDON_,What cruel means haue broght thee in this case.
6967,_LONDON_,At which the Lady turnd away her face.
6968,_LONDON_,
6969,_LONDON_,"O be not coy sweet! hide thou nought from me,"
6970,_LONDON_,"I am thy Nurse, she said, and haue good skill"
6971,_LONDON_,"In charms, & hearbs, & dreams, that powerful be,"
6972,_LONDON_,"Of what thou wantst, Ile helpe thee to thy fill."
6973,_LONDON_,"Art thou in loue, or witcht by any wight?"
6974,_LONDON_,"Il'e finde thee ease, or else will free the quite."
6975,_LONDON_,
6976,_LONDON_,"I haue bene wanton once as well as you,"
6977,_LONDON_,"Now yet by age, am altogether dull,"
6978,_LONDON_,"I haue beene loue-sicke, as you may be now,"
6979,_LONDON_,"Of toyes and loue-trickes I was wondrous full,"
6980,_LONDON_,"How strange so ere thy case do therefore stand,"
6981,_LONDON_,I can and will redresse it out of hand.
6982,_LONDON_,
6983,_LONDON_,"Thou art in _Loue_ (my sweet) I well espy,"
6984,_LONDON_,"If so, no lacke shalt finde in me, I sweare,"
6985,_LONDON_,"The Lady in her armes sob'd bitterly,"
6986,_LONDON_,"The Nurse replyd, and sayd; Why do not feare,"
6987,_LONDON_,Thy father shall not know of this at all:
6988,_LONDON_,"At which she starts, and on her bed doth fall."
6989,_LONDON_,
6990,_LONDON_,"And frantickly she tumbles on her face,"
6991,_LONDON_,"And said, get hence (good Nurse) I pre'thee go,"
6992,_LONDON_,Constraine me not to shew my wicked case.
6993,_LONDON_,That case (quoth she) I pray thee let me know.
6994,_LONDON_,"Get hence, she answer'd, or enquire lesse,"
6995,_LONDON_,'Tis wickednesse thou wouldst haue me c[=o]fesse.
6996,_LONDON_,
6997,_LONDON_,"'Tis such a thing, that if I want, I die,"
