43,PREFACE,
44,PREFACE,There is something grotesque in the idea of a prose translation of a
45,PREFACE,"poet, though the practice is become so common that it has ceased to"
46,PREFACE,provoke a smile or demand an apology. The language of poetry is language
47,PREFACE,in fusion; that of prose is language fixed and crystallised; and an
48,PREFACE,attempt to copy the one material in the other must always count on
49,PREFACE,"failure to convey what is, after all, one of the most essential things"
50,PREFACE,"in poetry,--its poetical quality. And this is so with Virgil more,"
51,PREFACE,"perhaps, than with any other poet; for more, perhaps, than any other"
52,PREFACE,poet Virgil depends on his poetical quality from first to last. Such a
53,PREFACE,translation can only have the value of a copy of some great painting
54,PREFACE,"executed in mosaic, if indeed a copy in Berlin wool is not a closer"
55,PREFACE,analogy; and even at the best all it can have to say for itself will be
56,PREFACE,"in Virgil's own words, _Experiar sensus; nihil hic nisi carmina desunt._"
57,PREFACE,
58,PREFACE,In this translation I have in the main followed the text of Conington
59,PREFACE,and Nettleship. The more important deviations from this text are
60,PREFACE,mentioned in the notes; but I have not thought it necessary to give a
61,PREFACE,"complete list of various readings, or to mention any change except where"
62,PREFACE,it might lead to misapprehension. Their notes have also been used by me
63,PREFACE,throughout.
64,PREFACE,
65,PREFACE,Beyond this I have made constant use of the mass of ancient commentary
66,PREFACE,"going under the name of Servius; the most valuable, perhaps, of all, as"
67,PREFACE,it is in many ways the nearest to the poet himself. The explanation
68,PREFACE,given in it has sometimes been followed against those of the modern
69,PREFACE,editors. To other commentaries only occasional reference has been made.
70,PREFACE,The sense that Virgil is his own best interpreter becomes stronger as
71,PREFACE,one studies him more.
72,PREFACE,
73,PREFACE,"My thanks are due to Mr. EVELYN ABBOTT, Fellow and Tutor of Balliol, and"
74,PREFACE,"to the Rev. H. C. BEECHING, for much valuable suggestion and criticism."

90,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"exile of fate, to Italy and the shore of Lavinium; hard driven on land"
91,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"and on the deep by the violence of heaven, for cruel Juno's unforgetful"
92,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"anger, and hard bestead in war also, ere he might found a city and carry"
93,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"his gods into Latium; from whom is the Latin race, the lords of Alba,"
94,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,and the stately city Rome.

96,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Muse, tell me why, for what attaint of her deity, or in what vexation,"
97,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,did the Queen of heaven drive one so excellent in goodness to circle
98,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"through so many afflictions, to face so many toils? Is anger so fierce"

102,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
103,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"There was a city of ancient days that Tyrian settlers dwelt in,"
104,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Carthage, over against Italy and the Tiber mouths afar; rich of store,"
105,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"and mighty in war's fierce pursuits; wherein, they say, alone beyond all"
106,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"other lands had Juno her seat, and held Samos itself less dear. Here was"
107,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"her armour, here her chariot; even now, if fate permit, the goddess"
108,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,strives to nurture it for queen of the nations. Nevertheless she had
109,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"heard a race was issuing of the blood of [20-53]Troy, which sometime"
110,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"should overthrow her Tyrian citadel; from it should come a people, lord"
111,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"of lands and tyrannous in war, the destroyer of Libya: so rolled the"
112,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"destinies. Fearful of that, the daughter of Saturn, the old war in her"
113,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"remembrance that she fought at Troy for her beloved Argos long ago,--nor"
114,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,had the springs of her anger nor the bitterness of her vexation yet gone
115,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"out of mind: deep stored in her soul lies the judgment of Paris, the"
116,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"insult of her slighted beauty, the hated race and the dignities of"
117,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"ravished Ganymede; fired with this also, she tossed all over ocean the"
118,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Trojan remnant left of the Greek host and merciless Achilles, and held"
119,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,them afar from Latium; and many a year were they wandering driven of
120,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,fate around all the seas. Such work was it to found the Roman people.
121,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
122,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,Hardly out of sight of the land of Sicily did they set their sails to
123,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"sea, and merrily upturned the salt foam with brazen prow, when Juno, the"
124,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"undying wound still deep in her heart, thus broke out alone:"
125,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
126,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"'Am I then to abandon my baffled purpose, powerless to keep the Teucrian"
127,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,king from Italy? and because fate forbids me? Could Pallas lay the
128,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Argive fleet in ashes, and sink the Argives in the sea, for one man's"
129,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"guilt, mad OÃ¯lean Ajax? Her hand darted Jove's flying fire from the"
130,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"clouds, scattered their ships, upturned the seas in tempest; him, his"
131,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"pierced breast yet breathing forth the flame, she caught in a whirlwind"
132,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"and impaled on a spike of rock. But I, who move queen among immortals, I"
133,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"sister and wife of Jove, wage warfare all these years with a single"
134,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"people; and is there any who still adores Juno's divinity, or will kneel"
135,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,to lay sacrifice on her altars?'
136,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
137,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Such thoughts inly revolving in her kindled bosom, the goddess reaches"
138,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Aeolia, the home of storm-clouds, the land laden with furious southern"
139,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,gales. Here in a desolate cavern Aeolus keeps under royal dominion and
140,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,yokes in [54-85]dungeon fetters the struggling winds and loud storms.
141,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,They with mighty moan rage indignant round their mountain barriers. In
142,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"his lofty citadel Aeolus sits sceptred, assuages their temper and"
143,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"soothes their rage; else would they carry with them seas and lands, and"
144,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"the depth of heaven, and sweep them through space in their flying"
145,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"course. But, fearful of this, the lord omnipotent hath hidden them in"
146,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"caverned gloom, and laid a mountain mass high over them, and appointed"
147,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"them a ruler, who should know by certain law to strain and slacken the"
148,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,reins at command. To him now Juno spoke thus in suppliant accents:
149,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
150,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,'Aeolus--for to thee hath the father of gods and king of men given the
151,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,wind that lulls and that lifts the waves--a people mine enemy sails the
152,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Tyrrhene sea, carrying into Italy the conquered gods of their Ilian"
153,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"home. Rouse thy winds to fury, and overwhelm their sinking vessels, or"
154,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,drive them asunder and strew ocean with their bodies. Mine are twice
155,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,seven nymphs of passing loveliness; her who of them all is most
156,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"excellent in beauty, DeÃ¯opea, I will unite to thee in wedlock to be"
157,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,thine for ever; that for this thy service she may fulfil all her years
158,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"at thy side, and make thee father of a beautiful race.'"
159,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
160,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Aeolus thus returned: 'Thine, O queen, the task to search whereto thou"
161,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,hast desire; for me it is right to do thy bidding. From thee have I this
162,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"poor kingdom, from thee my sceptre and Jove's grace; thou dost grant me"
163,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"to take my seat at the feasts of the gods, and makest me sovereign over"
164,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,clouds and storms.'
165,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
166,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Even with these words, turning his spear, he struck the side of the"
167,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"hollow hill, and the winds, as in banded array, pour where passage is"
168,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"given them, and cover earth with eddying blasts. East wind and west wind"
169,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"together, and the gusty south-wester, falling prone on the sea, stir it"
170,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"up [86-120]from its lowest chambers, and roll vast billows to the"
171,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,shore. Behind rises shouting of men and whistling of cordage. In a
172,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,moment clouds blot sky and daylight from the Teucrians' eyes; black
173,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"night broods over the deep. Pole thunders to pole, and the air quivers"
174,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,with incessant flashes; all menaces them with instant death. Straightway
175,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Aeneas' frame grows unnerved and chill, and stretching either hand to"
176,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"heaven, he cries thus aloud: 'Ah, thrice and four times happy they who"
177,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"found their doom under high Troy town before their fathers' faces! Ah,"
178,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"son of Tydeus, bravest of the Grecian race, that I could not have fallen"
179,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"on the Ilian plains, and gasped out this my life beneath thine hand!"
180,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"where under the spear of Aeacides lies fierce Hector, lies mighty"
181,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,Sarpedon; where SimoÃ¯s so often bore beneath his whirling wave shields
182,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,and helmets and brave bodies of men.'
183,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
184,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"As the cry leaves his lips, a gust of the shrill north strikes full on"
185,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,the sail and raises the waves up to heaven. The oars are snapped; the
186,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,prow swings away and gives her side to the waves; down in a heap comes a
187,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,broken mountain of water. These hang on the wave's ridge; to these the
188,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"yawning billow shows ground amid the surge, where the sea churns with"
189,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"sand. Three ships the south wind catches and hurls on hidden rocks,"
190,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"rocks amid the waves which Italians call the Altars, a vast reef banking"
191,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,the sea. Three the east forces from the deep into shallows and
192,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"quicksands, piteous to see, dashes on shoals and girdles with a"
193,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"sandbank. One, wherein loyal Orontes and his Lycians rode, before their"
194,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,lord's eyes a vast sea descending strikes astern. The helmsman is dashed
195,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,away and rolled forward headlong; her as she lies the billow sends
196,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"spinning thrice round with it, and engulfs in the swift whirl. Scattered"
197,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"swimmers appear in the vast eddy, armour of men, timbers and Trojan"
198,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"treasure amid the water. Ere now the stout ship of Ilioneus, ere now of"
199,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"brave Achates, and she wherein [121-152]Abas rode, and she wherein aged"
200,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Aletes, have yielded to the storm; through the shaken fastenings of"
201,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"their sides they all draw in the deadly water, and their opening seams"
202,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,give way.
203,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
204,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,Meanwhile Neptune discerned with astonishment the loud roaring of the
205,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"vexed sea, the tempest let loose from prison, and the still water"
206,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"boiling up from its depths, and lifting his head calm above the waves,"
207,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,looked forth across the deep. He sees all ocean strewn with Aeneas'
208,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"fleet, the Trojans overwhelmed by the waves and the ruining heaven."
209,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,Juno's guile and wrath lay clear to her brother's eye; east wind and
210,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"west he calls before him, and thereon speaks thus:"
211,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
212,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"'Stand you then so sure in your confidence of birth? Careless, O winds,"
213,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"of my deity, dare you confound sky and earth, and raise so huge a coil?"
214,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,you whom I--But better to still the aroused waves; for a second sin you
215,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"shall pay me another penalty. Speed your flight, and say this to your"
216,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,king: not to him but to me was allotted the stern trident of ocean
217,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"empire. His fastness is on the monstrous rocks where thou and thine,"
218,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"east wind, dwell: there let Aeolus glory in his palace and reign over"
219,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,the barred prison of his winds.'
220,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
221,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Thus he speaks, and ere the words are done he soothes the swollen seas,"
222,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"chases away the gathered clouds, and restores the sunlight. CymothoÃ« and"
223,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,Triton together push the ships strongly off the sharp reef; himself he
224,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"eases them with his trident, channels the vast quicksands, and assuages"
225,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"the sea, gliding on light wheels along the water. Even as when oft in a"
226,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"throng of people strife hath risen, and the base multitude rage in their"
227,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"minds, and now brands and stones are flying; madness lends arms; then if"
228,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"perchance they catch sight of one reverend for goodness and service,"
229,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,they are silent and stand by with attentive ear; he with
230,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,[153-190]speech sways their temper and soothes their breasts; even so
231,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"hath fallen all the thunder of ocean, when riding forward beneath a"
232,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,cloudless sky the lord of the sea wheels his coursers and lets his
233,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,gliding chariot fly with loosened rein.
234,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
235,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"The outworn Aeneadae hasten to run for the nearest shore, and turn to"
236,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,the coast of Libya. There lies a spot deep withdrawn; an island forms a
237,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"harbour with outstretched sides, whereon all the waves break from the"
238,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,open sea and part into the hollows of the bay. On this side and that
239,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"enormous cliffs rise threatening heaven, and twin crags beneath whose"
240,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,crest the sheltered water lies wide and calm; above hangs a background
241,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"of flickering forest, and the dark shade of rustling groves. Beneath the"
242,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"seaward brow is a rock-hung cavern, within it fresh springs and seats in"
243,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"the living stone, a haunt of nymphs; where tired ships need no fetters"
244,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,to hold nor anchor to fasten them with crooked bite. Here with seven
245,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,sail gathered of all his company Aeneas enters; and disembarking on the
246,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"land of their desire the Trojans gain the chosen beach, and set their"
247,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,feet dripping with brine upon the shore. At once Achates struck a spark
248,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"from the flint and caught the fire on leaves, and laying dry fuel round"
249,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"kindled it into flame. Then, weary of fortune, they fetch out corn"
250,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"spoiled by the sea and weapons of corn-dressing, and begin to parch over"
251,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,the fire and bruise in stones the grain they had rescued.
252,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
253,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Meanwhile Aeneas scales the crag, and seeks the whole view wide over"
254,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"ocean, if he may see aught of Antheus storm-tossed with his Phrygian"
255,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"galleys, aught of Capys or of CaÃ¯cus' armour high astern. Ship in sight"
256,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,is none; three stags he espies straying on the shore; behind whole herds
257,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"follow, and graze in long train across the valley. Stopping short, he"
258,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"snatched up a bow and swift arrows, the arms trusty Achates was"
259,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"carrying; and first the leaders, their stately heads high with branching"
260,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"antlers, then the common [191-222]herd fall to his hand, as he drives"
261,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,them with his shafts in a broken crowd through the leafy woods. Nor
262,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"stays he till seven great victims are stretched on the sod, fulfilling"
263,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,the number of his ships. Thence he seeks the harbour and parts them
264,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,among all his company. The casks of wine that good Acestes had filled on
265,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"the Trinacrian beach, the hero's gift at their departure, he thereafter"
266,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"shares, and calms with speech their sorrowing hearts:"
267,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
268,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"'O comrades, for not now nor aforetime are we ignorant of ill, O tried"
269,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"by heavier fortunes, unto this last likewise will God appoint an end."
270,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,The fury of Scylla and the roaring recesses of her crags you have been
271,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"anigh; the rocks of the Cyclops you have trodden. Recall your courage,"
272,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,put dull fear away. This too sometime we shall haply remember with
273,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"delight. Through chequered fortunes, through many perilous ways, we"
274,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"steer for Latium, where destiny points us a quiet home. There the realm"
275,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"of Troy may rise again unforbidden. Keep heart, and endure till"
276,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,prosperous fortune come.'
277,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
278,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Such words he utters, and sick with deep distress he feigns hope on his"
279,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"face, and keeps his anguish hidden deep in his breast. The others set to"
280,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"the spoil they are to feast upon, tear chine from ribs and lay bare the"
281,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,flesh; some cut it into pieces and pierce it still quivering with spits;
282,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,others plant cauldrons on the beach and feed them with flame. Then they
283,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"repair their strength with food, and lying along the grass take their"
284,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,fill of old wine and fat venison. After hunger is driven from the
285,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"banquet, and the board cleared, they talk with lingering regret of their"
286,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"lost companions, swaying between hope and fear, whether they may believe"
287,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"them yet alive, or now in their last agony and deaf to mortal call. Most"
288,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"does good Aeneas inly wail the loss now of valiant Orontes, now of"
289,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Amycus, the cruel doom of Lycus, of brave Gyas, and brave Cloanthus."
290,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,[223-254]And now they ceased; when from the height of air Jupiter
291,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"looked down on the sail-winged sea and outspread lands, the shores and"
292,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"broad countries, and looking stood on the cope of heaven, and cast down"
293,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"his eyes on the realm of Libya. To him thus troubled at heart Venus, her"
294,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"bright eyes brimming with tears, sorrowfully speaks:"
295,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
296,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,'O thou who dost sway mortal and immortal things with eternal command
297,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"and the terror of thy thunderbolt, how can my Aeneas have transgressed"
298,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"so grievously against thee? how his Trojans? on whom, after so many"
299,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"deaths outgone, all the world is barred for Italy's sake. From them"
300,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,sometime in the rolling years the Romans were to arise indeed; from them
301,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"were to be rulers who, renewing the blood of Teucer, should hold sea and"
302,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"land in universal lordship. This thou didst promise: why, O father, is"
303,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,thy decree reversed? This was my solace for the wretched ruin of sunken
304,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Troy, doom balanced against doom. Now so many woes are spent, and the"
305,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"same fortune still pursues them; Lord and King, what limit dost thou set"
306,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"to their agony? Antenor could elude the encircling Achaeans, could"
307,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"thread in safety the Illyrian bays and inmost realms of the Liburnians,"
308,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"could climb Timavus' source, whence through nine mouths pours the"
309,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"bursting tide amid dreary moans of the mountain, and covers the fields"
310,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"with hoarse waters. Yet here did he set Patavium town, a dwelling-place"
311,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"for his Teucrians, gave his name to a nation and hung up the armour of"
312,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Troy; now settled in peace, he rests and is in quiet. We, thy children,"
313,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"we whom thou beckonest to the heights of heaven, our fleet miserably"
314,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"cast away for a single enemy's anger, are betrayed and severed far from"
315,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,the Italian coasts. Is this the reward of goodness? Is it thus thou dost
316,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,restore our throne?'
317,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
318,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Smiling on her with that look which clears sky and [255-289]storms, the"
319,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,parent of men and gods lightly kissed his daughter's lips; then answered
320,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,thus:
321,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
322,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"'Spare thy fear, Cytherean; thy people's destiny abides unshaken. Thine"
323,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"eyes shall see the city Lavinium, their promised home; thou shalt exalt"
324,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,to the starry heaven thy noble Aeneas; nor is my decree reversed. He
325,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"thou lovest (for I will speak, since this care keeps torturing thee, and"
326,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,will unroll further the secret records of fate) shall wage a great war
327,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"in Italy, and crush warrior nations; he shall appoint his people a law"
328,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"and a city; till the third summer see him reigning in Latium, and three"
329,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"winters' camps pass over the conquered Rutulians. But the boy Ascanius,"
330,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,whose surname is now IÃ¼lus--Ilus he was while the Ilian state stood
331,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,sovereign--thirty great circles of rolling months shall he fulfil in
332,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"government; he shall carry the kingdom from its fastness in Lavinium,"
333,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,and make a strong fortress of Alba the Long. Here the full space of
334,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,thrice an hundred years shall the kingdom endure under the race of
335,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Hector's kin, till the royal priestess Ilia from Mars' embrace shall"
336,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"give birth to a twin progeny. Thence shall Romulus, gay in the tawny"
337,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"hide of the she-wolf that nursed him, take up their line, and name them"
338,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,Romans after his own name. I appoint to these neither period nor
339,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"boundary of empire: I have given them dominion without end. Nay, harsh"
340,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Juno, who in her fear now troubles earth and sea and sky, shall change"
341,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"to better counsels, and with me shall cherish the lords of the world,"
342,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,the gowned race of Rome. Thus is it willed. A day will come in the lapse
343,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"of cycles, when the house of Assaracus shall lay Phthia and famed"
344,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Mycenae in bondage, and reign over conquered Argos. From the fair line"
345,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"of Troy a Caesar shall arise, who shall limit his empire with ocean, his"
346,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"glory with the firmament, Julius, inheritor of great IÃ¼lus' name. Him"
347,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"one day, thy care done, thou shalt welcome to heaven loaded"
348,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,[290-321]with Eastern spoils; to him too shall vows be addressed. Then
349,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"shall war cease, and the iron ages soften. Hoar Faith and Vesta,"
350,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Quirinus and Remus brothers again, shall deliver statutes. The dreadful"
351,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,steel-riveted gates of war shall be shut fast; on murderous weapons the
352,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"inhuman Fury, his hands bound behind him with an hundred fetters of"
353,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"brass, shall sit within, shrieking with terrible blood-stained lips.'"
354,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
355,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"So speaking, he sends Maia's son down from above, that the land and"
356,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"towers of Carthage, the new town, may receive the Trojans with open"
357,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"welcome; lest Dido, ignorant of doom, might debar them her land. Flying"
358,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"through the depth of air on winged oarage, the fleet messenger alights"
359,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"on the Libyan coasts. At once he does his bidding; at once, for a god"
360,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"willed it, the Phoenicians allay their haughty temper; the queen above"
361,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,all takes to herself grace and compassion towards the Teucrians.
362,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
363,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"But good Aeneas, nightlong revolving many and many a thing, issues"
364,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"forth, so soon as bountiful light is given, to explore the strange"
365,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"country; to what coasts the wind has borne him, who are their habitants,"
366,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"men or wild beasts, for all he sees is wilderness; this he resolves to"
367,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"search, and bring back the certainty to his comrades. The fleet he hides"
368,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"close in embosoming groves beneath a caverned rock, amid shivering"
369,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"shadow of the woodland; himself, Achates alone following, he strides"
370,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"forward, clenching in his hand two broad-headed spears. And amid the"
371,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"forest his mother crossed his way, wearing the face and raiment of a"
372,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"maiden, the arms of a maiden of Sparta, or like Harpalyce of Thrace when"
373,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,she tires her coursers and outstrips the winged speed of Hebrus in her
374,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,flight. For huntress fashion had she slung the ready bow from her
375,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"shoulder, and left her blown tresses free, bared her knee, and knotted"
376,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"together her garments' flowing folds. 'Ha! my men,' she begins, 'shew me"
377,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,if [322-355]haply you have seen a sister of mine straying here girt
378,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"with quiver and a lynx's dappled fell, or pressing with shouts on the"
379,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,track of a foaming boar.'
380,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
381,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Thus Venus, and Venus' son answering thus began:"
382,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
383,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"'Sound nor sight have I had of sister of thine, O maiden unnamed; for"
384,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"thy face is not mortal, nor thy voice of human tone; O goddess"
385,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"assuredly! sister of Phoebus perchance, or one of the nymphs' blood?"
386,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Be thou gracious, whoso thou art, and lighten this toil of ours; deign"
387,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"to instruct us beneath what skies, on what coast of the world, we are"
388,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"thrown. Driven hither by wind and desolate waves, we wander in a strange"
389,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,land among unknown men. Many a sacrifice shall fall by our hand before
390,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,thine altars.'
391,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
392,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Then Venus: 'Nay, to no such offerings do I aspire. Tyrian maidens are"
393,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"wont ever to wear the quiver, to tie the purple buskin high above their"
394,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"ankle. Punic is the realm thou seest, Tyrian the people, and the city of"
395,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Agenor's kin; but their borders are Libyan, a race unassailable in war."
396,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Dido sways the sceptre, who flying her brother set sail from the Tyrian"
397,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"town. Long is the tale of crime, long and intricate; but I will briefly"
398,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"follow its argument. Her husband was Sychaeus, wealthiest in lands of"
399,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"the Phoenicians, and loved of her with ill-fated passion; to whom with"
400,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,virgin rites her father had given her maidenhood in wedlock. But the
401,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"kingdom of Tyre was in her brother Pygmalion's hands, a monster of guilt"
402,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"unparalleled. Between these madness came; the unnatural brother, blind"
403,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"with lust of gold, and reckless of his sister's love, lays Sychaeus low"
404,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,before the altars with stealthy unsuspected weapon; and for long he hid
405,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"the deed, and by many a crafty pretence cheated her love-sickness with"
406,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,hollow hope. But in slumber came the very ghost of her unburied husband;
407,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"lifting up a face pale in wonderful wise, he exposed the merciless"
408,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"altars and [356-387]his breast stabbed through with steel, and unwove"
409,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,all the blind web of household guilt. Then he counsels hasty flight out
410,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"of the country, and to aid her passage discloses treasures long hidden"
411,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"underground, an untold mass of silver and gold. Stirred thereby, Dido"
412,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,gathered a company for flight. All assemble in whom hatred of the tyrant
413,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,was relentless or fear keen; they seize on ships that chanced to lie
414,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"ready, and load them with the gold. Pygmalion's hoarded wealth is borne"
415,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,overseas; a woman leads the work. They came at last to the land where
416,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"thou wilt descry a city now great, New Carthage, and her rising citadel,"
417,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"and bought ground, called thence Byrsa, as much as a bull's hide would"
418,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"encircle. But who, I pray, are you, or from what coasts come, or whither"
419,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,hold you your way?'
420,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
421,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"At her question he, sighing and drawing speech deep from his breast,"
422,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,thus replied:
423,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
424,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"'Ah goddess, should I go on retracing from the fountain head, were time"
425,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"free to hear the history of our woes, sooner would the evening star lay"
426,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"day asleep in the closed gates of heaven. Us, as from ancient Troy (if"
427,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,the name of Troy hath haply passed through your ears) we sailed over
428,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"alien seas, the tempest at his own wild will hath driven on the Libyan"
429,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"coast. I am Aeneas the good, who carry in my fleet the household gods I"
430,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,rescued from the enemy; my fame is known high in heaven. I seek Italy my
431,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"country, my kin of Jove's supreme blood. With twenty sail did I climb"
432,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,the Phrygian sea; oracular tokens led me on; my goddess mother pointed
433,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,the way; scarce seven survive the shattering of wave and wind. Myself
434,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"unknown, destitute, driven from Europe and Asia, I wander over the"
435,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,Libyan wilderness.'
436,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
437,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"But staying longer complaint, Venus thus broke in on his half-told"
438,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,sorrows:
439,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
440,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"'Whoso thou art, not hated I think of the immortals [388-420]dost thou"
441,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"draw the breath of life, who hast reached the Tyrian city. Only go on,"
442,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,and betake thee hence to the courts of the queen. For I declare to thee
443,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"thy comrades are restored, thy fleet driven back into safety by the"
444,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"shifted northern gales, except my parents were pretenders, and"
445,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,unavailing the augury they taught me. Behold these twelve swans in
446,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"joyous line, whom, stooping from the tract of heaven, the bird of Jove"
447,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,fluttered over the open sky; now in long train they seem either to take
448,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,the ground or already to look down on the ground they took. As they
449,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"again disport with clapping wings, and utter their notes as they circle"
450,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"the sky in company, even so do these ships and crews of thine either lie"
451,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,fast in harbour or glide under full sail into the harbour mouth. Only go
452,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"on, and turn thy steps where the pathway leads thee.'"
453,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
454,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Speaking she turned away, and her neck shone roseate, her immortal"
455,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,tresses breathed the fragrance of deity; her raiment fell flowing down
456,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"to her feet, and the godhead was manifest in her tread. He knew her for"
457,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"his mother, and with this cry pursued her flight: 'Thou also merciless!"
458,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,Why mockest thou thy son so often in feigned likeness? Why is it
459,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"forbidden to clasp hand in hand, to hear and utter true speech?' Thus"
460,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,reproaching her he bends his steps towards the city. But Venus girt them
461,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"in their going with dull mist, and shed round them a deep divine"
462,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"clothing of cloud, that none might see them, none touch them, or work"
463,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"delay, or ask wherefore they came. Herself she speeds through the sky to"
464,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Paphos, and joyfully revisits her habitation, where the temple and its"
465,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"hundred altars steam with Sabaean incense, and are fresh with fragrance"
466,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,of chaplets in her worship.
467,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
468,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"They meantime have hasted along where the pathway points, and now were"
469,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"climbing the hill which hangs enormous over the city, and looks down on"
470,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"its facing towers. [421-456]Aeneas marvels at the mass of building,"
471,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"pastoral huts once of old, marvels at the gateways and clatter of the"
472,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"pavements. The Tyrians are hot at work to trace the walls, to rear the"
473,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"citadel, and roll up great stones by hand, or to choose a spot for their"
474,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,dwelling and enclose it with a furrow. They ordain justice and
475,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"magistrates, and the august senate. Here some are digging harbours, here"
476,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"others lay the deep foundations of their theatre, and hew out of the"
477,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"cliff vast columns, the lofty ornaments of the stage to be: even as bees"
478,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,when summer is fresh over the flowery country ply their task beneath the
479,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"sun, when they lead forth their nation's grown brood, or when they press"
480,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"the liquid honey and strain their cells with nectarous sweets, or"
481,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"relieve the loaded incomers, or in banded array drive the idle herd of"
482,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"drones far from their folds; they swarm over their work, and the odorous"
483,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,honey smells sweet of thyme. 'Happy they whose city already rises!'
484,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"cries Aeneas, looking on the town roofs below. Girt in the cloud he"
485,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"passes amid them, wonderful to tell, and mingling with the throng is"
486,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,descried of none.
487,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
488,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"In the heart of the town was a grove deep with luxuriant shade, wherein"
489,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"first the Phoenicians, buffeted by wave and whirlwind, dug up the token"
490,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Queen Juno had appointed, the head of a war horse: thereby was their"
491,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,race to be through all ages illustrious in war and opulent in living.
492,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Here to Juno was Sidonian Dido founding a vast temple, rich with"
493,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,offerings and the sanctity of her godhead: brazen steps rose on the
494,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"threshold, brass clamped the pilasters, doors of brass swung on grating"
495,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,hinges. First in this grove did a strange chance meet his steps and
496,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,allay his fears; first here did Aeneas dare to hope for safety and have
497,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,fairer trust in his shattered fortunes. For while he closely scans the
498,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"temple that towers above him, while, awaiting the queen, he admires the"
499,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"fortunate city, the emulous hands and elaborate work of her craftsmen,"
500,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"he sees ranged in order the [457-491]battles of Ilium, that war whose"
501,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"fame was already rumoured through all the world, the sons of Atreus and"
502,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Priam, and Achilles whom both found pitiless. He stopped and cried"
503,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"weeping, 'What land is left, Achates, what tract on earth that is not"
504,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"full of our agony? Behold Priam! Here too is the meed of honour, here"
505,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,mortal estate touches the soul to tears. Dismiss thy fears; the fame of
506,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,this will somehow bring thee salvation.'
507,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
508,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"So speaks he, and fills his soul with the painted show, sighing often"
509,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"the while, and his face wet with a full river of tears. For he saw, how"
510,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"warring round the Trojan citadel here the Greeks fled, the men of Troy"
511,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"hard on their rear; here the Phrygians, plumed Achilles in his chariot"
512,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,pressing their flight. Not far away he knows the snowy canvas of Rhesus'
513,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"tents, which, betrayed in their first sleep, the blood-stained son of"
514,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Tydeus laid desolate in heaped slaughter, and turns the ruddy steeds"
515,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,away to the camp ere ever they tasted Trojan fodder or drunk of Xanthus.
516,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Elsewhere TroÃ¯lus, his armour flung away in flight--luckless boy, no"
517,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"match for Achilles to meet!--is borne along by his horses, and thrown"
518,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"back entangled with his empty chariot, still clutching the reins; his"
519,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"neck and hair are dragged over the ground, and his reversed spear scores"
520,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,the dust. Meanwhile the Ilian women went with disordered tresses to
521,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"unfriendly Pallas' temple, and bore the votive garment, sadly beating"
522,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,breast with palm: the goddess turning away held her eyes fast on the
523,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"ground. Thrice had Achilles whirled Hector round the walls of Troy, and"
524,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,was selling the lifeless body for gold; then at last he heaves a loud
525,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"and heart-deep groan, as the spoils, as the chariot, as the dear body"
526,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"met his gaze, and Priam outstretching unarmed hands. Himself too he knew"
527,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"joining battle with the foremost Achaeans, knew the Eastern ranks and"
528,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,swart Memnon's armour. Penthesilea leads her crescent-shielded Amazonian
529,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,columns in furious heat with [492-524]thousands around her; clasping a
530,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"golden belt under her naked breast, the warrior maiden clashes boldly"
531,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,with men.
532,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
533,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"While these marvels meet Dardanian Aeneas' eyes, while he dizzily hangs"
534,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"rapt in one long gaze, Dido the queen entered the precinct, beautiful"
535,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"exceedingly, a youthful train thronging round her. Even as on Eurotas'"
536,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"banks or along the Cynthian ridges Diana wheels the dance, while behind"
537,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,her a thousand mountain nymphs crowd to left and right; she carries
538,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"quiver on shoulder, and as she moves outshines them all in deity;"
539,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Latona's heart is thrilled with silent joy; such was Dido, so she"
540,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"joyously advanced amid the throng, urging on the business of her rising"
541,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"empire. Then in the gates of the goddess, beneath the central vault of"
542,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"the temple roof, she took her seat girt with arms and high enthroned."
543,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"And now she gave justice and laws to her people, and adjusted or"
544,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,allotted their taskwork in due portion; when suddenly Aeneas sees
545,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,advancing with a great crowd about them Antheus and Sergestus and brave
546,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Cloanthus, and other of his Trojans, whom the black squall had sundered"
547,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,at sea and borne far away on the coast. Dizzy with the shock of joy and
548,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,fear he and Achates together were on fire with eagerness to clasp their
549,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"hands; but in confused uncertainty they keep hidden, and clothed in the"
550,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"sheltering cloud wait to espy what fortune befalls them, where they are"
551,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"leaving their fleet ashore, why they now come; for they advanced, chosen"
552,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"men from all the ships, praying for grace, and held on with loud cries"
553,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,towards the temple.
554,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
555,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"After they entered in, and free speech was granted, aged Ilioneus with"
556,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,placid mien thus began:
557,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
558,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"'Queen, to whom Jupiter hath given to found this new city, and lay the"
559,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"yoke of justice upon haughty tribes, we beseech thee, we wretched"
560,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Trojans storm-driven over all [525-559]the seas, stay the dreadful"
561,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"flames from our ships; spare a guiltless race, and bend a gracious"
562,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,regard on our fortunes. We are not come to deal slaughter through Libyan
563,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"homes, or to drive plundered spoils to the coast. Such violence sits not"
564,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"in our mind, nor is a conquered people so insolent. There is a place"
565,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Greeks name Hesperia, an ancient land, mighty in arms and foison of the"
566,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,clod; Oenotrian men dwelt therein; now rumour is that a younger race
567,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,from their captain's name have called it Italy. Thither lay our course
568,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,. . . when Orion rising on us through the cloudrack with sudden surf
569,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"bore us on blind shoals, and scattered us afar with his boisterous gales"
570,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,and whelming brine over waves and trackless reefs. To these your coasts
571,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"we a scanty remnant floated up. What race of men, what land how"
572,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"barbarous soever, allows such a custom for its own? We are debarred the"
573,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"shelter of the beach; they rise in war, and forbid us to set foot on the"
574,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"brink of their land. If you slight human kinship and mortal arms, yet"
575,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"look for gods unforgetful of innocence and guilt. Aeneas was our king,"
576,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"foremost of men in righteousness, incomparable in goodness as in warlike"
577,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"arms; whom if fate still preserves, if he draws the breath of heaven and"
578,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"lies not yet low in dispiteous gloom, fear we have none; nor mayest thou"
579,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,repent of challenging the contest of service. In Sicilian territory too
580,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"is tilth and town, and famed Acestes himself of Trojan blood. Grant us"
581,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"to draw ashore our storm-shattered fleet, to shape forest trees into"
582,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"beams and strip them for oars; so, if to Italy we may steer with our"
583,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"king and comrades found, Italy and Latium shall we gladly seek; but if"
584,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"salvation is clean gone, if the Libyan gulf holds thee, dear lord of thy"
585,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Trojans, and IÃ¼lus our hope survives no more, seek we then at least the"
586,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"straits of Sicily, the open homes whence we sailed hither, and Acestes"
587,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"for our king.' Thus Ilioneus, and all the Dardanian company"
588,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"[560-593]murmured assent. . . . Then Dido, with downcast face, briefly"
589,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,speaks:
590,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
591,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"'Cheer your anxious hearts, O Teucrians; put by your care. Hard fortune"
592,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"in a strange realm forces me to this task, to keep watch and ward on my"
593,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"wide frontiers. Who can be ignorant of the race of Aeneas' people, who"
594,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"of Troy town and her men and deeds, or of the great war's consuming"
595,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"fire? Not so dull are the hearts of our Punic wearing, not so far doth"
596,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,the sun yoke his steeds from our Tyrian town. Whether your choice be
597,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"broad Hesperia, the fields of Saturn's dominion, or Eryx for your"
598,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"country and Acestes for your king, my escort shall speed you in safety,"
599,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,my arsenals supply your need. Or will you even find rest here with me
600,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,and share my kingdom? The city I establish is yours; draw your ships
601,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,ashore; Trojan and Tyrian shall be held by me in even balance. And would
602,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"that he your king, that Aeneas were here, storm-driven to this same"
603,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"haven! But I will send messengers along the coast, and bid them trace"
604,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Libya to its limits, if haply he strays shipwrecked in forest or town.'"
605,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
606,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,Stirred by these words brave Achates and lord Aeneas both ere now burned
607,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"to break through the cloud. Achates first accosts Aeneas: 'Goddess-born,"
608,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"what purpose now rises in thy spirit? Thou seest all is safe, our fleet"
609,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"and comrades are restored. One only is wanting, whom our eyes saw"
610,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,whelmed amid the waves; all else is answerable to thy mother's words.'
611,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
612,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,Scarce had he spoken when the encircling cloud suddenly parts and melts
613,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"into clear air. Aeneas stood discovered in sheen of brilliant light,"
614,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,like a god in face and shoulders; for his mother's self had shed on her
615,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"son the grace of clustered locks, the radiant light of youth, and the"
616,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,lustre of joyous eyes; as when ivory takes beauty under the artist's
617,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"hand, or when silver or Parian stone is inlaid in gold. [594-625]Then"
618,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,breaking in on all with unexpected speech he thus addresses the queen:
619,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
620,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"'I whom you seek am here before you, Aeneas of Troy, snatched from the"
621,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Libyan waves. O thou who alone hast pitied Troy's untold agonies, thou"
622,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"who with us the remnant of the Grecian foe, worn out ere now by every"
623,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"suffering land and sea can bring, with us in our utter want dost share"
624,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"thy city and home! to render meet recompense is not possible for us, O"
625,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Dido, nor for all who scattered over the wide world are left of our"
626,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Dardanian race. The gods grant thee worthy reward, if their deity turn"
627,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"any regard on goodness, if aught avails justice and conscious purity of"
628,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,soul. What happy ages bore thee? what mighty parents gave thy virtue
629,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"birth? While rivers run into the sea, while the mountain shadows move"
630,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"across their slopes, while the stars have pasturage in heaven, ever"
631,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"shall thine honour, thy name and praises endure in the unknown lands"
632,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,that summon me.' With these words he advances his right hand to dear
633,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Ilioneus, his left to Serestus; then to the rest, brave Gyas and brave"
634,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,Cloanthus.
635,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
636,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Dido the Sidonian stood astonished, first at the sight of him, then at"
637,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,his strange fortunes; and these words left her lips:
638,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
639,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"'What fate follows thee, goddess-born, through perilous ways? what"
640,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,violence lands thee on this monstrous coast? Art thou that Aeneas whom
641,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,Venus the bountiful bore to Dardanian Anchises by the wave of Phrygian
642,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"SimoÃ¯s? And well I remember how Teucer came to Sidon, when exiled from"
643,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,his native land he sought Belus' aid to gain new realms; Belus my father
644,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,even then ravaged rich Cyprus and held it under his conquering sway.
645,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"From that time forth have I known the fall of the Trojan city, known thy"
646,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,name and the Pelasgian princes. Their very foe would extol the Teucrians
647,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"with highest praises, and boasted himself a branch [626-661]of the"
648,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"ancient Teucrian stem. Come therefore, O men, and enter our house. Me"
649,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"too hath a like fortune driven through many a woe, and willed at last to"
650,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,find my rest in this land. Not ignorant of ill do I learn to succour the
651,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,afflicted.'
652,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
653,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"With such speech she leads Aeneas into the royal house, and orders"
654,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,sacrifice in the gods' temples. Therewith she sends his company on
655,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"the shore twenty bulls, an hundred great bristly-backed swine, an"
656,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"hundred fat lambs and their mothers with them, gifts of the day's"
657,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,gladness. . . . But the palace within is decked with splendour of royal
658,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"state, and a banquet made ready amid the halls. The coverings are"
659,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,curiously wrought in splendid purple; on the tables is massy silver and
660,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"deeds of ancestral valour graven in gold, all the long course of history"
661,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,drawn through many a heroic name from the nation's primal antiquity.
662,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
663,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,Aeneas--for a father's affection denied his spirit rest--sends Achates
664,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"speeding to his ships, to carry this news to Ascanius, and lead him to"
665,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,the town: in Ascanius is fixed all the parent's loving care. Presents
666,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"likewise he bids him bring saved from the wreck of Ilium, a mantle stiff"
667,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"with gold embroidery, and a veil with woven border of yellow"
668,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"acanthus-flower, that once decked Helen of Argos, the marvel of her"
669,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"mother Leda's giving; Helen had borne them from Mycenae, when she sought"
670,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Troy towers and a lawless bridal; the sceptre too that Ilione, Priam's"
671,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"eldest daughter, once had worn, a beaded necklace, and a double circlet"
672,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"of jewelled gold. Achates, hasting on his message, bent his way towards"
673,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,the ships.
674,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
675,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"But in the Cytherean's breast new arts, new schemes revolve; if Cupid,"
676,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"changed in form and feature, may come in sweet Ascanius' room, and his"
677,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,gifts kindle the queen to madness and set her inmost sense aflame.
678,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Verily she fears the uncertain house, the double-tongued race of Tyre;"
679,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"[662-698]cruel Juno frets her, and at nightfall her care floods back."
680,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,Therefore to winged Love she speaks these words:
681,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
682,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"'Son, who art alone my strength and sovereignty, son, who scornest the"
683,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"mighty father's TyphoÃ¯an shafts, to thee I fly for succour, and sue"
684,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,humbly to thy deity. How Aeneas thy brother is driven about all the
685,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"sea-coasts by bitter Juno's malignity, this thou knowest, and hast often"
686,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,grieved in our grief. Now Dido the Phoenician holds him stayed with soft
687,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"words, and I tremble to think how the welcome of Juno's house may issue;"
688,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,she will not be idle in this supreme turn of fortune. Wherefore I
689,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"counsel to prevent her wiles and circle the queen with flame, that,"
690,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"unalterable by any deity, she may be held fast to me by passionate love"
691,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"for Aeneas. Take now my thought how to do this. The boy prince, my"
692,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"chiefest care, makes ready at his dear father's summons to go to the"
693,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Sidonian city, carrying gifts that survive the sea and the flames of"
694,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Troy. Him will I hide deep asleep in my holy habitation, high on"
695,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Cythera's hills or in Idalium, that he may not know nor cross our wiles."
696,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Do thou but for one night feign his form, and, boy as thou art, put on"
697,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"the familiar face of a boy; so when in festal cheer, amid royal dainties"
698,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"and Bacchic juice, Dido shall take thee to her lap, shall fold thee in"
699,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"her clasp and kiss thee close and sweet, thou mayest imbreathe a hidden"
700,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,fire and unsuspected poison.'
701,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,
702,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Love obeys his dear mother's words, lays by his wings, and walks"
703,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,rejoicingly with IÃ¼lus' tread. But Venus pours gentle dew of slumber on
704,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Ascanius' limbs, and lifts him lulled in her lap to the tall Idalian"
705,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"groves of her deity, where soft amaracus folds him round with the"
706,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"shadowed sweetness of its odorous blossoms. And now, obedient to her"
707,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"words, Cupid went merrily in Achates' guiding, with the royal gifts for"
708,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,the Tyrians. Already at his coming the queen hath sate her down in the
709,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,midmost on her golden [699-733]throne under the splendid tapestries;
710,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"now lord Aeneas, now too the men of Troy gather, and all recline on the"
711,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"strewn purple. Servants pour water on their hands, serve corn from"
712,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"baskets, and bring napkins with close-cut pile. Fifty handmaids are"
713,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"within, whose task is in their course to keep unfailing store and kindle"
714,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"the household fire. An hundred others, and as many pages all of like"
715,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"age, load the board with food and array the wine cups. Therewithal the"
716,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Tyrians are gathered full in the wide feasting chamber, and take their"
717,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,appointed places on the broidered cushions. They marvel at Aeneas'
718,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"gifts, marvel at IÃ¼lus, at the god's face aflame and forged speech, at"
719,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,the mantle and veil wrought with yellow acanthus-flower. Above all the
720,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"hapless Phoenician, victim to coming doom, cannot satiate her soul, but,"
721,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"stirred alike by the boy and the gifts, she gazes and takes fire. He,"
722,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,when hanging clasped on Aeneas' neck he had satisfied all the deluded
723,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"parent's love, makes his way to the queen; the queen clings to him with"
724,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"her eyes and all her soul, and ever and anon fondles him in her lap, ah,"
725,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"poor Dido! witless how mighty a deity sinks into her breast; but he,"
726,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"mindful of his mother the Acidalian, begins touch by touch to efface"
727,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Sychaeus, and sows the surprise of a living love in the"
728,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,long-since-unstirred spirit and disaccustomed heart. Soon as the noise
729,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"of banquet ceased and the board was cleared, they set down great bowls"
730,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,and enwreathe the wine. The house is filled with hum of voices eddying
731,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"through the spacious chambers; lit lamps hang down by golden chainwork,"
732,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,and flaming tapers expel the night. Now the queen called for a heavy cup
733,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"of jewelled gold, and filled it with pure wine; therewith was the use of"
734,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Belus and all of Belus' race: then the hall was silenced. 'Jupiter,' she"
735,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"cries, 'for thou art reputed lawgiver of hospitality, grant that this be"
736,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"a joyful day to the Tyrians and the voyagers from Troy, a day to live in"
737,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"our children's memory. [734-756]Bacchus, the giver of gladness, be with"
738,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"us, and Juno the bountiful; and you, O Tyrians, be favourable to our"
739,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"assembly.' She spoke, and poured liquid libation on the board, which"
740,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"done, she first herself touched it lightly with her lips, then handed it"
741,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"to Bitias and bade him speed; he valiantly drained the foaming cup, and"
742,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,flooded him with the brimming gold. The other princes followed.
743,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,Long-haired Iopas on his gilded lyre fills the chamber with songs
744,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,ancient Atlas taught; he sings of the wandering moon and the sun's
745,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"travails; whence is the human race and the brute, whence water and fire;"
746,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"of Arcturus, the rainy Hyades, and the twin Oxen; why wintry suns make"
747,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"such haste to dip in ocean, or what delay makes the nights drag"
748,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,lingeringly. Tyrians and Trojans after them redouble applause.
749,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Therewithal Dido wore the night in changing talk, alas! and drank long"
750,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"draughts of love, asking many a thing of Priam, many a thing of Hector;"
751,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,now in what armour the son of the Morning came; now of what fashion were
752,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Diomede's horses; now of mighty Achilles. 'Nay, come,' she cries, 'tell"
753,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"to us, O guest, from their first beginning the treachery of the"
754,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,"Grecians, thy people's woes, and thine own wanderings; for this is now"
755,THE COMING OF AENEAS TO CARTHAGE,the seventh summer that bears thee a wanderer over all the earth and

2130,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",wilt thou contend so with a love to thy liking? nor does it cross thy

2132,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","Gaetulian towns, a race unconquerable in war; the reinless Numidian"
2133,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",riders and the grim Syrtis hem thee in; on this lies a thirsty tract of
2134,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","desert, swept by the raiders of Barca. Why speak of the war gathering"
2135,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","from Tyre, and thy brother's menaces? . . . With gods' auspices to my"
2136,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","thinking, and with Juno's favour, hath the Ilian fleet held on hither"

2143,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","of love flame up in her spirit, put hope in her wavering soul, and let"

2146,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","[56-90]First they visit the shrines, and desire grace from altar to"

2148,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","Phoebus and lord Lyaeus, to Juno before all, guardian of the marriage"

2154,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",how may vows or shrines help her madness? all the while the subtle flame
2155,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","consumes her inly, and deep in her breast the wound is silent and alive."
2156,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","Stung to misery, Dido wanders in frenzy all down the city, even as an"

2158,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",shepherd archer hath pierced and left the flying steel in her unaware;
2159,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",she ranges in flight the Dictaean forest lawns; fast in her side clings
2160,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","the deadly reed. Now she leads Aeneas with her through the town, and"
2161,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","displays her Sidonian treasure and ordered city; she essays to speak,"
2162,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","and breaks off half-way in utterance. Now, as day wanes, she seeks the"
2163,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","repeated banquet, and again madly pleads to hear the agonies of Ilium,"
2164,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","and again hangs on the teller's lips. Thereafter, when all are gone"
2165,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","their ways, and the dim moon in turn quenches her light, and the setting"
2166,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","stars counsel to sleep, alone in the empty house she mourns, and flings"
2167,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",herself on the couch he left: distant she hears and sees him in the

2169,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","Ascanius on her lap, if so she may steal the love she may not utter. No"
2170,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","more do the unfinished towers rise, no more do the people exercise in"
2171,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","arms, nor work for safety in war on harbour or bastion; the works hang"

2173,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2174,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","So soon as she perceives her thus fast in the toils, and [91-124]madly"

2177,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2178,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","'Noble indeed is the fame and splendid the spoils you win, thou and that"
2179,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","boy of thine, and mighty the renown of deity, if two gods have"
2180,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",vanquished one woman by treachery. Nor am I so blind to thy terror of
2181,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","our town, thine old suspicion of the high house of Carthage. But what"
2182,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","shall be the end? or why all this contest now? Nay, rather let us work"
2183,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",an enduring peace and a bridal compact. Thou hast what all thy soul
2184,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","desired; Dido is on fire with love, and hath caught the madness through"
2185,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",and through. Then rule we this people jointly in equal lordship; allow
2186,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","her to be a Phrygian husband's slave, and to lay her Tyrians for dowry"
2187,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",in thine hand.'
2188,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2189,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","To her--for she knew the dissembled purpose of her words, to turn the"
2190,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",Teucrian kingdom away to the coasts of Libya--Venus thus began in
2191,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","answer: 'Who so mad as to reject these terms, or choose rather to try"
2192,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","the fortune of war with thee? if only when done, as thou sayest, fortune"
2193,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","follow. But I move in uncertainty of Jove's ordinance, whether he will"
2194,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","that Tyrians and wanderers from Troy be one city, or approve the"
2195,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","mingling of peoples and the treaty of union. Thou art his wife, and thy"
2196,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",prayers may essay his soul. Go on; I will follow.'
2197,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2198,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","Then Queen Juno thus rejoined: 'That task shall be mine. Now, by what"
2199,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","means the present need may be fulfilled, attend and I will explain in"
2200,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",brief. Aeneas and Dido (alas and woe for her!) are to go hunting
2201,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",together in the woodland when to-morrow's rising sun goes forth and his
2202,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","rays unveil the world. On them, while the beaters run up and down, and"
2203,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","the lawns are girt with toils, will I pour down a blackening rain-cloud"
2204,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","mingled with hail, and startle all the sky in thunder. Their company"
2205,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",will scatter for shelter in the dim darkness; Dido and the Trojan
2206,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","captain [125-159]shall take refuge in the same cavern. I will be there,"
2207,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","and if thy goodwill is assured me, I will unite them in wedlock, and"
2208,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",make her wholly his; here shall Hymen be present.' The Cytherean gave
2209,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","ready assent to her request, and laughed at the wily invention."
2210,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2211,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",Meanwhile Dawn rises forth of ocean. A chosen company issue from the
2212,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","gates while the morning star is high; they pour forth with meshed nets,"
2213,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","toils, broad-headed hunting spears, Massylian horsemen and sinewy"
2214,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","sleuth-hounds. At her doorway the chief of Carthage await their queen,"
2215,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","who yet lingers in her chamber, and her horse stands splendid in gold"
2216,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",and purple with clattering feet and jaws champing on the foamy bit. At
2217,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","last she comes forth amid a great thronging train, girt in a Sidonian"
2218,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","mantle, broidered with needlework; her quiver is of gold, her tresses"
2219,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","knotted into gold, a golden buckle clasps up her crimson gown."
2220,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",Therewithal the Phrygian train advances with joyous IÃ¼lus. Himself first
2221,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","and foremost of all, Aeneas joins her company and unites his party to"
2222,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","hers: even as Apollo, when he leaves wintry Lycia and the streams of"
2223,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","Xanthus to visit his mother's Delos, and renews the dance, while Cretans"
2224,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",and Dryopes and painted Agathyrsians mingle clamorous about his altars:
2225,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","himself he treads the Cynthian ridges, and plaits his flowing hair with"
2226,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",soft heavy sprays and entwines it with gold; the arrows rattle on his
2227,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",shoulder: as lightly as he went Aeneas; such glow and beauty is on his
2228,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",princely face. When they are come to the mountain heights and pathless
2229,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","coverts, lo, wild goats driven from the cliff-tops run down the ridge;"
2230,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",in another quarter stags speed over the open plain and gather their
2231,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",flying column in a cloud of dust as they leave the hills. But the boy
2232,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","Ascanius is in the valleys, exultant on his fiery horse, and gallops"
2233,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","past one and another, praying that among the unwarlike herds a foaming"
2234,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",boar may issue or a tawny lion descend the hill.
2235,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2236,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",[160-194]Meanwhile the sky begins to thicken and roar aloud. A
2237,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",rain-cloud comes down mingled with hail; the Tyrian train and the men of
2238,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","Troy, and the Dardanian boy of Venus' son scatter in fear, and seek"
2239,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",shelter far over the fields. Streams pour from the hills. Dido and the
2240,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",Trojan captain take refuge in the same cavern. Primeval Earth and Juno
2241,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","the bridesmaid give the sign; fires flash out high in air, witnessing"
2242,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","the union, and Nymphs cry aloud on the mountain-top. That day opened the"
2243,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",gate of death and the springs of ill. For now Dido recks not of eye or
2244,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","tongue, nor sets her heart on love in secret: she calls it marriage, and"
2245,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",with this name veils her fall.
2246,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2247,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","Straightway Rumour runs through the great cities of Libya,--Rumour, than"
2248,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",whom none other is more swift to mischief; she thrives on restlessness
2249,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",and gains strength by going: at first small and timorous; soon she lifts
2250,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",herself on high and paces the ground with head hidden among the clouds.
2251,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","Her, one saith, Mother Earth, when stung by wrath against the gods, bore"
2252,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","last sister to Coeus and Enceladus, fleet-footed and swift of wing,"
2253,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","ominous, awful, vast; for every feather on her body is a waking eye"
2254,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","beneath, wonderful to tell, and a tongue, and as many loud lips and"
2255,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","straining ears. By night she flits between sky and land, shrilling"
2256,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","through the dusk, and droops not her lids in sweet slumber; in daylight"
2257,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","she sits on guard upon tall towers or the ridge of the house-roof, and"
2258,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",makes great cities afraid; obstinate in perverseness and forgery no less
2259,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",than messenger of truth. She then exultingly filled the countries with
2260,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","manifold talk, and blazoned alike what was done and undone: one Aeneas"
2261,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","is come, born of Trojan blood; on him beautiful Dido thinks no shame to"
2262,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","fling herself; now they hold their winter, long-drawn through mutual"
2263,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","caresses, regardless of their realms and enthralled by passionate"
2264,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",dishonour. This the pestilent goddess [195-227]spreads abroad in the
2265,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","mouths of men, and bends her course right on to King Iarbas, and with"
2266,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",her words fires his spirit and swells his wrath.
2267,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2268,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","He, the seed of Ammon by a ravished Garamantian Nymph, had built to Jove"
2269,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","in his wide realms an hundred great temples, an hundred altars, and"
2270,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",consecrated the wakeful fire that keeps watch by night before the gods
2271,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","perpetually, where the soil is fat with blood of beasts and the courts"
2272,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","blossom with pied garlands. And he, distracted and on fire at the bitter"
2273,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","tidings, before his altars, amid the divine presences, often, it is"
2274,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","said, bowed in prayer to Jove with uplifted hands:"
2275,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2276,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","'Jupiter omnipotent, to whom from the broidered cushions of their"
2277,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","banqueting halls the Maurusian people now pour Lenaean offering, lookest"
2278,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",thou on this? or do we shudder vainly when our father hurls the
2279,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","thunderbolt, and do blind fires in the clouds and idle rumblings appal"
2280,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","our soul? The woman who, wandering in our coasts, planted a small town"
2281,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","on purchased ground, to whom we gave fields by the shore and laws of"
2282,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","settlement, she hath spurned our alliance and taken Aeneas for lord of"
2283,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","her realm. And now that Paris, with his effeminate crew, his chin and"
2284,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","oozy hair swathed in the turban of Maeonia, takes and keeps her; since"
2285,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","to thy temples we bear oblation, and hallow an empty name.'"
2286,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2287,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","In such words he pleaded, clasping the altars; the Lord omnipotent"
2288,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","heard, and cast his eye on the royal city and the lovers forgetful of"
2289,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",their fairer fame. Then he addresses this charge to Mercury:
2290,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2291,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","'Up and away, O son! call the breezes and slide down them on thy wings:"
2292,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",accost the Dardanian captain who now loiters in Tyrian Carthage and
2293,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",casts not a look on destined cities; carry down my words through the
2294,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",fleet air. Not such an one did his mother most beautiful vouch him to
2295,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","[228-264]us, nor for this twice rescue him from Grecian arms; but he"
2296,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","was to rule an Italy teeming with empire and loud with war, to transmit"
2297,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","the line of Teucer's royal blood, and lay all the world beneath his law."
2298,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","If such glories kindle him in nowise, and he take no trouble for his own"
2299,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","honour, does a father grudge his Ascanius the towers of Rome? with what"
2300,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","device or in what hope loiters he among a hostile race, and casts not a"
2301,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",glance on his Ausonian children and the fields of Lavinium? Let him set
2302,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",sail: this is the sum: thereof be thou our messenger.'
2303,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2304,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",He ended: his son made ready to obey his high command. And first he
2305,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",laces to his feet the shoes of gold that bear him high winging over seas
2306,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",or land as fleet as the gale; then takes the rod wherewith he calls wan
2307,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","souls forth of Orcus, or sends them again to the sad depth of hell,"
2308,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",gives sleep and takes it away and unseals dead eyes; in whose strength
2309,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",he courses the winds and swims across the tossing clouds. And now in
2310,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","flight he descries the peak and steep sides of toiling Atlas, whose"
2311,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","crest sustains the sky; Atlas, whose pine-clad head is girt alway with"
2312,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",black clouds and beaten by wind and rain; snow is shed over his
2313,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",shoulders for covering; rivers tumble over his aged chin; and his rough
2314,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","beard is stiff with ice. Here the Cyllenian, poised evenly on his wings,"
2315,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",made a first stay; hence he shot himself sheer to the water. Like a bird
2316,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","that flies low, skirting the sea about the craggy shores of its fishery,"
2317,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","even thus the brood of Cyllene left his mother's father, and flew,"
2318,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","cutting the winds between sky and land, along the sandy Libyan shore. So"
2319,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","soon as his winged feet reached the settlement, he espies Aeneas"
2320,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",founding towers and ordering new dwellings; his sword twinkled with
2321,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","yellow jasper, and a cloak hung from his shoulders ablaze with Tyrian"
2322,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","sea-purple, a gift that Dido had made costly and shot the warp with thin"
2323,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",gold. Straightway [265-299]he breaks in: 'Layest thou now the
2324,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","foundations of tall Carthage, and buildest up a fair city in dalliance?"
2325,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","ah, forgetful of thine own kingdom and state! From bright Olympus I"
2326,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","descend to thee at express command of heaven's sovereign, whose deity"
2327,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",sways sky and earth; expressly he bids me carry this charge through the
2328,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",fleet air: with what device or in what hope dost thou loiter idly on
2329,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","Libyan lands? if such glories kindle thee in nowise, yet cast an eye on"
2330,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","growing Ascanius, on IÃ¼lus thine hope and heir, to whom the kingdom of"
2331,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",Italy and the Roman land are due.' As these words left his lips the
2332,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","Cyllenian, yet speaking, quitted mortal sight and vanished into thin air"
2333,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",away out of his eyes.
2334,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2335,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","But Aeneas in truth gazed in dumb amazement, his hair thrilled up, and"
2336,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",the accents faltered on his tongue. He burns to flee away and leave the
2337,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","pleasant land, aghast at the high warning and divine ordinance. Alas,"
2338,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",what shall he do? how venture to smooth the tale to the frenzied queen?
2339,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",what prologue shall he find? and this way and that he rapidly throws his
2340,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","mind, and turns it on all hands in swift change of thought. In his"
2341,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",perplexity this seemed the better counsel; he calls Mnestheus and
2342,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","Sergestus, and brave Serestus, and bids them silently equip the fleet,"
2343,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","gather their crews on shore, and order their armament, keeping the cause"
2344,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","of the commotion hid; himself meanwhile, since Dido the gracious knows"
2345,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","not nor looks for severance to so strong a love, will essay to approach"
2346,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","her when she may be told most gently, and the way for it be fair. All at"
2347,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","once gladly do as bidden, and obey his command."
2348,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2349,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","But the Queen--who may delude a lover?--foreknew his devices, and at"
2350,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",once caught the presaging stir. Safety's self was fear; to her likewise
2351,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",had evil Rumour borne the maddening news that they equip the fleet and
2352,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","prepare [300-334]for passage. Helpless at heart, she reels aflame with"
2353,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","rage throughout the city, even as the startled Thyiad in her frenzied"
2354,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","triennial orgies, when the holy vessels move forth and the cry of"
2355,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","Bacchus re-echoes, and Cithaeron calls her with nightlong din. Thus at"
2356,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",last she opens out upon Aeneas:
2357,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2358,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","'And thou didst hope, traitor, to mask the crime, and slip away in"
2359,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","silence from my land? Our love holds thee not, nor the hand thou once"
2360,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","gavest, nor the bitter death that is left for Dido's portion? Nay, under"
2361,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","the wintry star thou labourest on thy fleet, and hastenest to launch"
2362,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","into the deep amid northern gales; ah, cruel! Why, were thy quest not of"
2363,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","alien fields and unknown dwellings, did thine ancient Troy remain,"
2364,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",should Troy be sought in voyages over tossing seas? Fliest thou from me?
2365,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","me who by these tears and thine own hand beseech thee, since naught"
2366,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","else, alas! have I kept mine own--by our union and the marriage rites"
2367,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","preparing; if I have done thee any grace, or aught of mine hath once"
2368,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","been sweet in thy sight,--pity our sinking house, and if there yet be"
2369,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","room for prayers, put off this purpose of thine. For thy sake Libyan"
2370,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",tribes and Nomad kings are hostile; my Tyrians are estranged; for thy
2371,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","sake, thine, is mine honour perished, and the former fame, my one title"
2372,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","to the skies. How leavest thou me to die, O my guest? since to this the"
2373,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",name of husband is dwindled down. For what do I wait? till Pygmalion
2374,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","overthrow his sister's city, or Gaetulian Iarbas lead me to captivity?"
2375,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",At least if before thy flight a child of thine had been clasped in my
2376,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","arms,--if a tiny Aeneas were playing in my hall, whose face might yet"
2377,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","image thine,--I would not think myself ensnared and deserted utterly.'"
2378,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2379,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","She ended; he by counsel of Jove held his gaze unstirred, and kept his"
2380,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",distress hard down in his heart. At last he briefly answers:
2381,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2382,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","'Never, O Queen, will I deny that thy goodness hath [335-368]gone high"
2383,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",as thy words can swell the reckoning; nor will my memory of Elissa be
2384,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","ungracious while I remember myself, and breath sways this body. Little"
2385,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",will I say in this. I never hoped to slip away in stealthy flight; fancy
2386,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",not that; nor did I ever hold out the marriage torch or enter thus into
2387,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","alliance. Did fate allow me to guide my life by mine own government, and"
2388,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","calm my sorrows as I would, my first duty were to the Trojan city and"
2389,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","the dear remnant of my kindred; the high house of Priam should abide,"
2390,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",and my hand had set up Troy towers anew for a conquered people. But now
2391,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","for broad Italy hath Apollo of Grynos bidden me steer, for Italy the"
2392,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",oracles of Lycia. Here is my desire; this is my native country. If thy
2393,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","Phoenician eyes are stayed on Carthage towers and thy Libyan city, what"
2394,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","wrong is it, I pray, that we Trojans find our rest on Ausonian land? We"
2395,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","too may seek a foreign realm unforbidden. In my sleep, often as the dank"
2396,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","shades of night veil the earth, often as the stars lift their fires, the"
2397,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",troubled phantom of my father Anchises comes in warning and dread; my
2398,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","boy Ascanius, how I wrong one so dear in cheating him of an Hesperian"
2399,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","kingdom and destined fields. Now even the gods' interpreter, sent"
2400,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",straight from Jove--I call both to witness--hath borne down his commands
2401,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",through the fleet air. Myself in broad daylight I saw the deity passing
2402,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","within the walls, and these ears drank his utterance. Cease to madden me"
2403,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",and thyself alike with plaints. Not of my will do I follow Italy. . . .'
2404,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2405,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","Long ere he ended she gazes on him askance, turning her eyes from side"
2406,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",to side and perusing him with silent glances; then thus wrathfully
2407,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",speaks:
2408,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2409,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","'No goddess was thy mother, nor Dardanus founder of thy line, traitor!"
2410,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","but rough Caucasus bore thee on his iron crags, and Hyrcanian tigresses"
2411,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",gave thee suck. For why do I conceal it? For what further outrage do I
2412,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","wait? [369-400]Hath our weeping cost him a sigh, or a lowered glance?"
2413,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","Hath he broken into tears, or had pity on his lover? Where, where shall"
2414,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",I begin? Now neither doth Queen Juno nor our Saturnian lord regard us
2415,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",with righteous eyes. Nowhere is trust safe. Cast ashore and destitute I
2416,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","welcomed him, and madly gave him place and portion in my kingdom; I"
2417,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","found him his lost fleet and drew his crews from death. Alas, the fire"
2418,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","of madness speeds me on. Now prophetic Apollo, now oracles of Lycia, now"
2419,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",the very gods' interpreter sent straight from Jove through the air
2420,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","carries these rude commands! Truly that is work for the gods, that a"
2421,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","care to vex their peace! I detain thee not, nor gainsay thy words: go,"
2422,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",follow thine Italy down the wind; seek thy realm overseas. Yet midway my
2423,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","hope is, if righteous gods can do aught at all, thou wilt drain the cup"
2424,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","of vengeance on the rocks, and re-echo calls on Dido's name. In murky"
2425,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","fires I will follow far away, and when chill death hath severed body"
2426,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","from soul, my ghost will haunt thee in every region. Wretch, thou shalt"
2427,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",repay! I will hear; and the rumour of it shall reach me deep in the
2428,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",under world.'
2429,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2430,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","Even on these words she breaks off her speech unfinished, and, sick at"
2431,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","heart, escapes out of the air and sweeps round and away out of sight,"
2432,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","leaving him in fear and much hesitance, and with much on his mind to"
2433,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","say. Her women catch her in their arms, and carry her swooning to her"
2434,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",marble chamber and lay her on her bed.
2435,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2436,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","But good Aeneas, though he would fain soothe and comfort her grief, and"
2437,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","talk away her distress, with many a sigh, and melted in soul by his"
2438,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","great love, yet fulfils the divine commands and returns to his fleet."
2439,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","Then indeed the Teucrians set to work, and haul down their tall ships"
2440,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",all along the shore. The hulls are oiled and afloat; they carry from the
2441,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","woodland green boughs for oars and massy logs unhewn, in hot haste to"
2442,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",go. . . . One might descry them shifting [401-433]their quarters and
2443,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","pouring out of all the town: even as ants, mindful of winter, plunder a"
2444,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",great heap of wheat and store it in their house; a black column advances
2445,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",on the plain as they carry home their spoil on a narrow track through
2446,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","the grass. Some shove and strain with their shoulders at big grains,"
2447,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",some marshal the ranks and chastise delay; all the path is aswarm with
2448,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","work. What then were thy thoughts, O Dido, as thou sawest it? What sighs"
2449,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","didst thou utter, viewing from the fortress roof the broad beach aswarm,"
2450,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",and seeing before thine eyes the whole sea stirred with their noisy din?
2451,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","Injurious Love, to what dost thou not compel mortal hearts! Again, she"
2452,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","must needs break into tears, again essay entreaty, and bow her spirit"
2453,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","down to love, not to leave aught untried and go to death in vain."
2454,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2455,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","'Anna, thou seest the bustle that fills the shore. They have gathered"
2456,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","round from every quarter; already their canvas woos the breezes, and the"
2457,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","merry sailors have garlanded the sterns. This great pain, my sister, I"
2458,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","shall have strength to bear, as I have had strength to foresee. Yet this"
2459,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","one thing, Anna, for love and pity's sake--for of thee alone was the"
2460,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","traitor fain, to thee even his secret thoughts were confided, alone thou"
2461,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","knewest his moods and tender fits--go, my sister, and humbly accost the"
2462,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",haughty stranger: I did not take the Grecian oath in Aulis to root out
2463,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",the race of Troy; I sent no fleet against her fortresses; neither have I
2464,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","disentombed his father Anchises' ashes and ghost, that he should refuse"
2465,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",my words entrance to his stubborn ears. Whither does he run? let him
2466,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","grant this grace--alas, the last!--to his lover, and await fair winds"
2467,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","and an easy passage. No more do I pray for the old delusive marriage,"
2468,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",nor that he give up fair Latium and abandon a kingdom. A breathing-space
2469,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","I ask, to give my madness rest and room, till my very [434-469]fortune"
2470,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","teach my grief submission. This last favour I implore: sister, be"
2471,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","pitiful; grant this to me, and I will restore it in full measure when I"
2472,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",die.'
2473,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2474,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","So she pleaded, and so her sister carries and recarries the piteous tale"
2475,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","of weeping. But by no weeping is he stirred, inflexible to all the words"
2476,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","he hears. Fate withstands, and lays divine bars on unmoved mortal ears."
2477,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",Even as when the eddying blasts of northern Alpine winds are emulous to
2478,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","uproot the secular strength of a mighty oak, it wails on, and the trunk"
2479,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",quivers and the high foliage strews the ground; the tree clings fast on
2480,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","the rocks, and high as her top soars into heaven, so deep strike her"
2481,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",roots to hell; even thus is the hero buffeted with changeful perpetual
2482,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","accents, and distress thrills his mighty breast, while his purpose stays"
2483,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","unstirred, and tears fall in vain."
2484,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2485,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","Then indeed, hapless and dismayed by doom, Dido prays for death, and is"
2486,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",weary of gazing on the arch of heaven. The more to make her fulfil her
2487,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","purpose and quit the light, she saw, when she laid her gifts on the"
2488,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","altars alight with incense, awful to tell, the holy streams blacken, and"
2489,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",the wine turn as it poured into ghastly blood. Of this sight she spoke
2490,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","to none--no, not to her sister. Likewise there was within the house a"
2491,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","marble temple of her ancient lord, kept of her in marvellous honour, and"
2492,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",fastened with snowy fleeces and festal boughs. Forth of it she seemed to
2493,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",hear her husband's voice crying and calling when night was dim upon
2494,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","earth, and alone on the house-tops the screech-owl often made moan with"
2495,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",funeral note and long-drawn sobbing cry. Therewithal many a warning of
2496,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",wizards of old terrifies her with appalling presage. In her sleep fierce
2497,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","Aeneas drives her wildly, and ever she seems being left by herself"
2498,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","alone, ever going uncompanioned on a weary way, and seeking her Tyrians"
2499,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",in a solitary land: even as frantic Pentheus sees the [470-503]arrayed
2500,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","Furies and a double sun, and Thebes shows herself twofold to his eyes:"
2501,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","or Agamemnonian Orestes, renowned in tragedy, when his mother pursues"
2502,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","him armed with torches and dark serpents, and the Fatal Sisters crouch"
2503,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",avenging in the doorway.
2504,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2505,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","So when, overcome by her pangs, she caught the madness and resolved to"
2506,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","die, she works out secretly the time and fashion, and accosts her"
2507,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",sorrowing sister with mien hiding her design and hope calm on her brow.
2508,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2509,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","'I have found a way, mine own--wish me joy, sisterlike--to restore him"
2510,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",to me or release me of my love for him. Hard by the ocean limit and the
2511,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","set of sun is the extreme Aethiopian land, where ancient Atlas turns on"
2512,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",his shoulders the starred burning axletree of heaven. Out of it hath
2513,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","been shown to me a priestess of Massylian race, warder of the temple of"
2514,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","the Hesperides, even she who gave the dragon his food, and kept the holy"
2515,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","boughs on the tree, sprinkling clammy honey and slumberous poppy-seed."
2516,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","She professes with her spells to relax the purposes of whom she will,"
2517,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",but on others to bring passion and pain; to stay the river-waters and
2518,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",turn the stars backward: she calls up ghosts by night; thou shalt see
2519,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",earth moaning under foot and mountain-ashes descending from the hills. I
2520,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","take heaven, sweet, to witness, and thee, mine own darling sister, I do"
2521,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",not willingly arm myself with the arts of magic. Do thou secretly raise
2522,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","a pyre in the inner court, and let them lay on it the arms that the"
2523,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","accursed one left hanging in our chamber, and all the dress he wore, and"
2524,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",the bridal bed where I fell. It is good to wipe out all the wretch's
2525,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","traces, and the priestess orders thus.' So speaks she, and is silent,"
2526,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",while pallor overruns her face. Yet Anna deems not her sister veils
2527,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","death behind these strange rites, and grasps not her wild purpose, nor"
2528,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",fears aught deeper than at Sychaeus' death. So she makes ready as
2529,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",bidden. . . .
2530,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2531,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","[504-538]But the Queen, the pyre being built up of piled faggots and"
2532,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","sawn ilex in the inmost of her dwelling, hangs the room with chaplets"
2533,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",and garlands it with funeral boughs: on the pillow she lays the dress he
2534,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","wore, the sword he left, and an image of him, knowing what was to come."
2535,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","Altars are reared around, and the priestess, with hair undone, thrice"
2536,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","peals from her lips the hundred gods of Erebus and Chaos, and the"
2537,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","triform Hecate, the triple-faced maidenhood of Diana. Likewise she had"
2538,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","sprinkled pretended waters of Avernus' spring, and rank herbs are sought"
2539,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","mown by moonlight with brazen sickles, dark with milky venom, and sought"
2540,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",is the talisman torn from a horse's forehead at birth ere the dam could
2541,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","snatch it. . . . Herself, the holy cake in her pure hands, hard by the"
2542,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","altars, with one foot unshod and garments flowing loose, she invokes the"
2543,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","gods ere she die, and the stars that know of doom; then prays to"
2544,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",whatsoever deity looks in righteousness and remembrance on lovers ill
2545,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",allied.
2546,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2547,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","Night fell; weary creatures took quiet slumber all over earth, and"
2548,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",woodland and wild waters had sunk to rest; now the stars wheel midway on
2549,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","their gliding path, now all the country is silent, and beasts and gay"
2550,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",birds that haunt liquid levels of lake or thorny rustic thicket lay
2551,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",couched asleep under the still night. But not so the distressed
2552,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","Phoenician, nor does she ever sink asleep or take the night upon eyes or"
2553,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","breast; her pain redoubles, and her love swells to renewed madness, as"
2554,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","she tosses on the strong tide of wrath. Even so she begins, and thus"
2555,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",revolves with her heart alone:
2556,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2557,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","'See, what do I? Shall I again make trial of mine old wooers that will"
2558,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",scorn me? and stoop to sue for a Numidian marriage among those whom
2559,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",already over and over I have disdained for husbands? Then shall I follow
2560,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",the Ilian fleets and the uttermost bidding of the Teucrians? because it
2561,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","is good to think they were once raised up by my [539-570]succour, or"
2562,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",the grace of mine old kindness is fresh in their remembrance? And how
2563,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","should they let me, if I would? or take the odious woman on their"
2564,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","haughty ships? art thou ignorant, ah me, even in ruin, and knowest not"
2565,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",yet the forsworn race of Laomedon? And then? shall I accompany the
2566,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","triumphant sailors, a lonely fugitive? or plunge forth girt with all my"
2567,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","Tyrian train? so hardly severed from Sidon city, shall I again drive"
2568,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","them seaward, and bid them spread their sails to the tempest? Nay die"
2569,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","thou, as thou deservest, and let the steel end thy pain. With thee it"
2570,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","began; overborne by my tears, thou, O my sister, dost load me with this"
2571,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","madness and agony, and layest me open to the enemy. I could not spend a"
2572,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","wild life without stain, far from a bridal chamber, and free from touch"
2573,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","of distress like this! O faith ill kept, that was plighted to Sychaeus'"
2574,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",ashes!' Thus her heart broke in long lamentation.
2575,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2576,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","Now Aeneas was fixed to go, and now, with all set duly in order, was"
2577,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",taking hasty sleep on his high stern. To him as he slept the god
2578,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","appeared once again in the same fashion of countenance, and thus seemed"
2579,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","to renew his warning, in all points like to Mercury, voice and hue and"
2580,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","golden hair and limbs gracious in youth. 'Goddess-born, canst thou sleep"
2581,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","on in such danger? and seest not the coming perils that hem thee in,"
2582,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","madman! nor hearest the breezes blowing fair? She, fixed on death, is"
2583,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","revolving craft and crime grimly in her bosom, and swells the changing"
2584,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","surge of wrath. Fliest thou not hence headlong, while headlong flight is"
2585,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",yet possible? Even now wilt thou see ocean weltering with broken
2586,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","timbers, see the fierce glare of torches and the beach in a riot of"
2587,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","flame, if dawn break on thee yet dallying in this land. Up ho! linger no"
2588,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","more! Woman is ever a fickle and changing thing.' So spoke he, and"
2589,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",melted in the black night.
2590,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2591,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","[571-603]Then indeed Aeneas, startled by the sudden phantom, leaps out"
2592,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","of slumber and bestirs his crew. 'Haste and awake, O men, and sit down"
2593,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","to the thwarts; shake out sail speedily. A god sent from high heaven,"
2594,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",lo! again spurs us to speed our flight and cut the twisted cables. We
2595,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","follow thee, holy one of heaven, whoso thou art, and again joyfully obey"
2596,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",thy command. O be favourable; give gracious aid and bring fair sky and
2597,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","weather.' He spoke, and snatching his sword like lightning from the"
2598,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","sheath, strikes at the hawser with the drawn steel. The same zeal"
2599,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",catches all at once; rushing and tearing they quit the shore; the sea is
2600,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",hidden under their fleets; strongly they toss up the foam and sweep the
2601,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",blue water.
2602,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2603,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","And now Dawn broke, and, leaving the saffron bed of Tithonus, shed her"
2604,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",radiance anew over the world; when the Queen saw from her watch-tower
2605,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","the first light whitening, and the fleet standing out under squared"
2606,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","sail, and discerned shore and haven empty of all their oarsmen. Thrice"
2607,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",and four times she struck her hand on her lovely breast and rent her
2608,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","yellow hair: 'God!' she cries, 'shall he go? shall an alien make mock of"
2609,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","our realm? Will they not issue in armed pursuit from all the city, and"
2610,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","some launch ships from the dockyards? Go; bring fire in haste, serve"
2611,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","weapons, swing out the oars! What do I talk? or where am I? what mad"
2612,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","change is on my purpose? Alas, Dido! now thou dost feel thy wickedness;"
2613,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","that had graced thee once, when thou gavest away thy crown. Behold the"
2614,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","faith and hand of him! who, they say, carries his household's ancestral"
2615,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",gods about with him! who stooped his shoulders to a father outworn with
2616,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",age! Could I not have riven his body in sunder and strewn it on the
2617,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","waves? and slain with the sword his comrades and his dear Ascanius, and"
2618,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",served him for the banquet at his father's table? But the chance of
2619,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",battle had been dubious. If it had! whom did I fear [604-635]with my
2620,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",death upon me? I should have borne firebrands into his camp and filled
2621,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","his decks with flame, blotted out father and son and race together, and"
2622,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","flung myself atop of all. Sun, whose fires lighten all the works of the"
2623,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","world, and thou, Juno, mediatress and witness of these my distresses,"
2624,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","and Hecate, cried on by night in crossways of cities, and you, fatal"
2625,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","avenging sisters and gods of dying Elissa, hear me now; bend your just"
2626,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","deity to my woes, and listen to our prayers. If it must needs be that"
2627,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","the accursed one touch his haven and float up to land, if thus Jove's"
2628,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","decrees demand, and this is the appointed term,--yet, distressed in war"
2629,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","by an armed and gallant nation, driven homeless from his borders, rent"
2630,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","from IÃ¼lus' embrace, let him sue for succour and see death on death"
2631,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",untimely on his people; nor when he hath yielded him to the terms of a
2632,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","harsh peace, may he have joy of his kingdom or the pleasant light; but"
2633,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",let him fall before his day and without burial on a waste of sand. This
2634,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",I pray; this and my blood with it I pour for the last utterance. And
2635,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","you, O Tyrians, hunt his seed with your hatred for all ages to come;"
2636,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",send this guerdon to our ashes. Let no kindness nor truce be between the
2637,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","nations. Arise out of our dust, O unnamed avenger, to pursue the"
2638,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","Dardanian settlement with firebrand and steel. Now, then, whensoever"
2639,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","strength shall be given, I invoke the enmity of shore to shore, wave to"
2640,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","water, sword to sword; let their battles go down to their children's"
2641,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",children.'
2642,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2643,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","So speaks she as she kept turning her mind round about, seeking how"
2644,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",soonest to break away from the hateful light. Thereon she speaks briefly
2645,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","to Barce, nurse of Sychaeus; for a heap of dusky ashes held her own, in"
2646,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",her country of long ago:
2647,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2648,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","'Sweet nurse, bring Anna my sister hither to me. Bid her haste and"
2649,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","sprinkle river water over her body, and bring [636-667]with her the"
2650,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",beasts ordained for expiation: so let her come: and thou likewise veil
2651,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",thy brows with a pure chaplet. I would fulfil the rites of Stygian Jove
2652,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","that I have fitly ordered and begun, so to set the limit to my"
2653,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",distresses and give over to the flames the funeral pyre of the
2654,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",Dardanian.'
2655,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2656,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","So speaks she; the old woman went eagerly with quickened pace. But Dido,"
2657,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","fluttered and fierce in her awful purpose, with bloodshot restless gaze,"
2658,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",and spots on her quivering cheeks burning through the pallor of imminent
2659,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","death, bursts into the inner courts of the house, and mounts in madness"
2660,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","the high funeral pyre, and unsheathes the sword of Dardania, a gift"
2661,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",asked for no use like this. Then after her eyes fell on the Ilian
2662,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","raiment and the bed she knew, dallying a little with her purpose through"
2663,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","her tears, she sank on the pillow and spoke the last words of all:"
2664,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2665,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","'Dress he wore, sweet while doom and deity allowed! receive my spirit"
2666,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","now, and release me from my distresses. I have lived and fulfilled"
2667,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",Fortune's allotted course; and now shall I go a queenly phantom under
2668,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",the earth. I have built a renowned city; I have seen my ramparts rise;
2669,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",by my brother's punishment I have avenged my husband of his enemy;
2670,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","happy, ah me! and over happy, had but the keels of Dardania never"
2671,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","touched our shores!' She spoke; and burying her face in the pillow,"
2672,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","'Death it will be,' she cries, 'and unavenged; but death be it. Thus,"
2673,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",thus is it good to pass into the dark. Let the pitiless Dardanian's gaze
2674,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","drink in this fire out at sea, and my death be the omen he carries on"
2675,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",his way.'
2676,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2677,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","She ceased; and even as she spoke her people see her sunk on the steel,"
2678,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",and blood reeking on the sword and spattered on her hands. A cry rises
2679,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",in the high halls; Rumour riots down the quaking city. The house
2680,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",resounds with lamentation and sobbing and bitter crying of women;
2681,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",[668-700]heaven echoes their loud wails; even as though all Carthage or
2682,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","ancient Tyre went down as the foe poured in, and the flames rolled"
2683,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","furious over the roofs of house and temple. Swooning at the sound, her"
2684,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","sister runs in a flutter of dismay, with torn face and smitten bosom,"
2685,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","and darts through them all, and calls the dying woman by her name. 'Was"
2686,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","it this, mine own? Was my summons a snare? Was it this thy pyre, ah me,"
2687,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",this thine altar fires meant? How shall I begin my desolate moan? Didst
2688,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",thou disdain a sister's company in death? Thou shouldst have called me
2689,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","to share thy doom; in the self-same hour, the self-same pang of steel"
2690,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","had been our portion. Did these very hands build it, did my voice call"
2691,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","on our father's gods, that with thee lying thus I should be away as one"
2692,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","without pity? Thou hast destroyed thyself and me together, O my sister,"
2693,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","and the Sidonian lords and people, and this thy city. Give her wounds"
2694,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",water: I will bathe them and catch on my lips the last breath that haply
2695,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","yet lingers.' So speaking she had climbed the high steps, and, wailing,"
2696,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","clasped and caressed her half-lifeless sister in her bosom, and stanched"
2697,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","the dark streams of blood with her gown. She, essaying to lift her heavy"
2698,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","eyes, swoons back; the deep-driven wound gurgles in her breast. Thrice"
2699,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","she rose, and strained to lift herself on her elbow; thrice she rolled"
2700,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","back on the pillow, and with wandering eyes sought the light of high"
2701,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","heaven, and moaned as she found it."
2702,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",
2703,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","Then Juno omnipotent, pitying her long pain and difficult decease, sent"
2704,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END",Iris down from heaven to unloose the struggling life from the body where
2705,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","it clung. For since neither by fate did she perish, nor as one who had"
2706,"THE LOVE OF DIDO, AND HER END","earned her death, but woefully before her day, and fired by sudden"

2722,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,
2723,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Meanwhile Aeneas and his fleet in unwavering track now held mid passage,"
2724,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"and cleft the waves that blackened under the North, looking back on the"
2725,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,city that even now gleams with hapless Elissa's funeral flame. Why the
2726,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,broad blaze is lit lies unknown; but the bitter pain of a great love
2727,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"trampled, and the knowledge of what woman can do in madness, draw the"
2728,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,Teucrians' hearts to gloomy guesses.
2729,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,
2730,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"When their ships held the deep, nor any land farther appears, the seas"
2731,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"all round, and all round the sky, a dusky shower drew up overhead,"
2732,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"carrying night and storm, and the wave shuddered and gloomed. Palinurus,"
2733,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"master of the fleet, cries from the high stern: 'Alas, why have these"
2734,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"heavy storm-clouds girt the sky? lord Neptune, what wilt thou?' Then he"
2735,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"bids clear the rigging and bend strongly to the oars, and brings the"
2736,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"sails across the wind, saying thus:"
2737,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,
2738,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"'Noble Aeneas, not did Jupiter give word and warrant would I hope to"
2739,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,reach Italy under such a sky. The shifting winds roar athwart our
2740,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"course, and blow stronger out of the black west, and the air thickens"
2741,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,into mist: nor are we fit to force our way on and across. Fortune is the
2742,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"stronger; let us follow her, and turn our course whither she calls."
2743,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"[23-55]Not far away, I think, are the faithful shores of thy brother"
2744,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Eryx, and the Sicilian haven, if only my memory retraces rightly the"
2745,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,stars I watched before.'
2746,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,
2747,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Then good Aeneas: 'Even I ere now discern the winds will have it so, and"
2748,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,thou urgest against them in vain. Turn thou the course of our sailing.
2749,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Could any land be welcomer to me, or where I would sooner choose to put"
2750,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"in my weary ships, than this that hath Dardanian Acestes to greet me,"
2751,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"and laps in its embrace lord Anchises' dust?' This said, they steer for"
2752,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"harbour, while the following west wind stretches their sails; the fleet"
2753,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"runs fast down the flood, and at last they land joyfully on the familiar"
2754,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"beach. But Acestes high on a hill-top, amazed at the friendly squadron"
2755,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"approaching from afar, hastens towards them, weaponed and clad in the"
2756,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,shaggy skin of a Libyan she-bear. Him a Trojan mother conceived and bore
2757,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"to Crimisus river; not forgetful of his parentage, he wishes them joy of"
2758,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"their return, and gladly entertains them on his rustic treasure and"
2759,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,comforts their weariness with his friendly store. So soon as the
2760,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"morrow's clear daylight had chased the stars out of the east, Aeneas"
2761,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"calls his comrades along the beach together, and from a mounded hillock"
2762,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,speaks:
2763,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,
2764,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"'Great people of Dardanus, born of the high blood of gods, the yearly"
2765,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,circle of the months is measured out to fulfilment since we laid the
2766,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"dust in earth, all that was left of my divine father, and sadly"
2767,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"consecrated our altars. And now the day is at hand (this, O gods, was"
2768,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"your will), which I will ever keep in grief, ever in honour. Did I spend"
2769,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"it an exile on Gaetulian quicksands, did it surprise me on the Argolic"
2770,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"sea or in Mycenae town, yet would I fulfil the yearly vows and annual"
2771,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"ordinance of festival, and pile the altars with their due gifts. Now we"
2772,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"are led hither, to the very dust and ashes of our father, not as I deem"
2773,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"without [56-90]divine purpose and influence, and borne home into the"
2774,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,friendly haven. Up then and let us all gather joyfully to the sacrifice:
2775,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"pray we for winds, and may he deign that I pay these rites to him year"
2776,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,by year in an established city and consecrated temple. Two head of oxen
2777,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Acestes, the seed of Troy, gives to each of your ships by tale: invite"
2778,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"to the feast your own ancestral gods of the household, and those whom"
2779,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"our host Acestes worships. Further, so the ninth Dawn uplift the"
2780,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"gracious day upon men, and her shafts unveil the world, I will ordain"
2781,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,contests for my Trojans; first for swift ships; then whoso excels in the
2782,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"foot-race, and whoso, confident in strength and skill, comes to shoot"
2783,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"light arrows, or adventures to join battle with gloves of raw hide; let"
2784,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"all be here, and let merit look for the prize and palm. Now all be"
2785,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"hushed, and twine your temples with boughs.'"
2786,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,
2787,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"So speaks he, and shrouds his brows with his mother's myrtle. So Helymus"
2788,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"does, so Aletes ripe of years, so the boy Ascanius, and the rest of the"
2789,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,people follow. He advances from the assembly to the tomb among a throng
2790,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,of many thousands that crowd about him; here he pours on the ground in
2791,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"fit libation two goblets of pure wine, two of new milk, two of"
2792,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"consecrated blood, and flings bright blossoms, saying thus: 'Hail, holy"
2793,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"father, once again; hail, ashes of him I saved in vain, and soul and"
2794,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,shade of my sire! Thou wert not to share the search for Italian borders
2795,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"and destined fields, nor the dim Ausonian Tiber.' Thus had he spoken;"
2796,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,when from beneath the sanctuary a snake slid out in seven vast coils and
2797,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"sevenfold slippery spires, quietly circling the grave and gliding from"
2798,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"altar to altar, his green chequered body and the spotted lustre of his"
2799,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"scales ablaze with gold, as the bow in the cloud darts a thousand"
2800,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,changing dyes athwart the sun: Aeneas stood amazed at the sight. At last
2801,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"he wound [91-126]his long train among the vessels and polished cups,"
2802,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"and tasted the feast, and again leaving the altars where he had fed,"
2803,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,crept harmlessly back beneath the tomb. Doubtful if he shall think it
2804,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"the Genius of the ground or his father's ministrant, he slays, as is"
2805,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"fit, two sheep of two years old, as many swine and dark-backed steers,"
2806,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"pouring the while cups of wine, and calling on the soul of great"
2807,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Anchises and the ghost rearisen from Acheron. Therewithal his comrades,"
2808,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"as each hath store, bring gifts to heap joyfully on the altars, and slay"
2809,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"steers in sacrifice: others set cauldrons arow, and, lying along the"
2810,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"grass, heap live embers under spits and roast the flesh."
2811,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,
2812,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"The desired day came, and now the ninth Dawn rode up clear and bright"
2813,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,behind PhaÃ«thon's coursers; and the name and renown of illustrious
2814,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,Acestes had stirred up all the bordering people; their holiday throng
2815,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"filled the shore, to see Aeneas' men, and some ready to join in contest."
2816,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,First of all the prizes are laid out to view in the middle of the
2817,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"racecourse; tripods of sacrifice, green garlands and palms, the reward"
2818,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"of the conquerors, armour and garments dipped in purple, talents of"
2819,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,silver and gold: and from a hillock in the midst the trumpet sounds the
2820,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"games begun. First is the contest of rowing, and four ships matched in"
2821,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"weight enter, the choice of all the fleet. Mnestheus' keen oarsmen drive"
2822,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"the swift Dragon, Mnestheus the Italian to be, from whose name is the"
2823,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Memmian family; Gyas the huge bulk of the huge Chimaera, a floating"
2824,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"town, whom her triple-tiered Dardanian crew urge on with oars rising in"
2825,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"threefold rank; Sergestus, from whom the Sergian house holds her name,"
2826,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"sails in the tall Centaur; and in the sea-coloured Scylla Cloanthus,"
2827,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"whence is thy family, Cluentius of Rome."
2828,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,
2829,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Apart in the sea and over against the foaming beach, lies a rock that"
2830,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,the swoln waves beat and drown what time the [127-159]north-western
2831,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,gales of winter blot out the stars; in calm it rises silent out of the
2832,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"placid water, flat-topped, and a haunt where cormorants love best to"
2833,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"take the sun. Here lord Aeneas set up a goal of leafy ilex, a mark for"
2834,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"the sailors to know whence to return, where to wheel their long course"
2835,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"round. Then they choose stations by lot, and on the sterns their"
2836,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"captains glitter afar, beautiful in gold and purple; the rest of the"
2837,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"crews are crowned with poplar sprays, and their naked shoulders glisten"
2838,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"wet with oil. They sit down at the thwarts, and their arms are tense on"
2839,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"the oars; at full strain they wait the signal, while throbbing fear and"
2840,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"heightened ambition drain their riotous blood. Then, when the clear"
2841,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"trumpet-note rang, all in a moment leap forward from their line; the"
2842,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"shouts of the sailors strike up to heaven, and the channels are swept"
2843,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,into foam by the arms as they swing backward. They cleave their furrows
2844,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"together, and all the sea is torn asunder by oars and triple-pointed"
2845,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,prows. Not with speed so headlong do racing pairs whirl the chariots
2846,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"over the plain, as they rush streaming from the barriers; not so do"
2847,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"their charioteers shake the wavy reins loose over their team, and hang"
2848,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,forward on the whip. All the woodland rings with clapping and shouts of
2849,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"men that cheer their favourites, and the sheltered beach eddies back"
2850,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,their cries; the noise buffets and re-echoes from the hills. Gyas shoots
2851,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"out in front of the noisy crowd, and glides foremost along the water;"
2852,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"whom Cloanthus follows next, rowing better, but held back by his"
2853,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"dragging weight of pine. After them, at equal distance, the Dragon and"
2854,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"the Centaur strive to win the foremost room; and now the Dragon has it,"
2855,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,now the vast Centaur outstrips and passes her; now they dart on both
2856,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"together, their stems in a line, and their keels driving long furrows"
2857,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"through the salt water-ways. And now they drew nigh the rock, and were"
2858,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"hard [160-193]on the goal; when Gyas as he led, winner over half the"
2859,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"flood, cries aloud to Menoetes, the ship's steersman: 'Whither away so"
2860,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"far to the right? This way direct her path; kiss the shore, and let the"
2861,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,oarblade graze the leftward reefs. Others may keep to deep water.' He
2862,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"spoke; but Menoetes, fearing blind rocks, turns the bow away towards the"
2863,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"open sea. 'Whither wanderest thou away? to the rocks, Menoetes!' again"
2864,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,shouts Gyas to bring him back; and lo! glancing round he sees Cloanthus
2865,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,passing up behind and keeping nearer. Between Gyas' ship and the echoing
2866,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"crags he scrapes through inside on his left, flashes past his leader,"
2867,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,and leaving the goal behind is in safe water. Then indeed grief burned
2868,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"fierce through his strong frame, and tears sprung out on his cheeks;"
2869,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"heedless of his own dignity and his crew's safety, he flings the too"
2870,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"cautious Menoetes sheer into the sea from the high stern, himself"
2871,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"succeeds as guide and master of the helm, and cheers on his men, and"
2872,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"turns his tiller in to shore. But Menoetes, when at last he rose"
2873,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"struggling from the bottom, heavy with advancing years and wet in his"
2874,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"dripping clothes, makes for the top of the crag, and sits down on a dry"
2875,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"rock. The Teucrians laughed out as he fell and as he swam, and laugh to"
2876,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,see him spitting the salt water from his chest. At this a joyful hope
2877,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"kindled in the two behind, Sergestus and Mnestheus, of catching up Gyas'"
2878,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"wavering course. Sergestus slips forward as he nears the rock, yet not"
2879,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"all in front, nor leading with his length of keel; part is in front,"
2880,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,part pressed by the Dragon's jealous prow. But striding amidships
2881,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"between his comrades, Mnestheus cheers them on: 'Now, now swing back,"
2882,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"oarsmen who were Hector's comrades, whom I chose to follow me in Troy's"
2883,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,extremity; now put forth the might and courage you showed in Gaetulian
2884,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"quicksands, amid Ionian seas and Malea's chasing waves. Not the first"
2885,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"[194-227]place do I now seek for Mnestheus, nor strive for victory;"
2886,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"though ah!--yet let them win, O Neptune, to whom thou givest it. But the"
2887,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"shame of coming in last! Win but this, fellow-citizens, and avert that"
2888,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"disaster!' His men bend forward, straining every muscle; the brasswork"
2889,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"of the ship quivers to their mighty strokes, and the ground runs from"
2890,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"under her; limbs and parched lips shake with their rapid panting, and"
2891,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,sweat flows in streams all over them. Mere chance brought the crew the
2892,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,glory they desired. For while Sergestus drives his prow furiously in
2893,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"towards the rocks and comes up with too scanty room, alas! he caught on"
2894,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"a rock that ran out; the reef ground, the oars struck and shivered on"
2895,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"the jagged teeth, and the bows crashed and hung. The sailors leap up and"
2896,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"hold her with loud cries, and get out iron-shod poles and sharp-pointed"
2897,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"boathooks, and pick up their broken oars out of the eddies. But"
2898,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Mnestheus, rejoicing and flushed by his triumph, with oars fast-dipping"
2899,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"and winds at his call, issues into the shelving water and runs down the"
2900,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,open sea. As a pigeon whose house and sweet nestlings are in the rock's
2901,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"recesses, if suddenly startled from her cavern, wings her flight over"
2902,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,the fields and rushes frightened from her house with loud clapping
2903,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"pinions; then gliding noiselessly through the air, slides on her liquid"
2904,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"way and moves not her rapid wings; so Mnestheus, so the Dragon under him"
2905,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"swiftly cleaves the last space of sea, so her own speed carries her"
2906,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"flying on. And first Sergestus is left behind, struggling on the steep"
2907,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"rock and shoal water, and shouting in vain for help and learning to race"
2908,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,with broken oars. Next he catches up Gyas and the vast bulk of the
2909,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Chimaera; she gives way, without her steersman. And now on the very goal"
2910,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Cloanthus alone is left; him he pursues and presses hard, straining all"
2911,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"his strength. Then indeed the shouts redouble, as all together eagerly"
2912,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"cheer on the pursuer, and [228-264]the sky echoes their din. These"
2913,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"scorn to lose the honour that is their own, the glory in their grasp,"
2914,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,and would sell life for renown; to these success lends life; power comes
2915,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,with belief in it. And haply they had carried the prize with prows
2916,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"abreast, had not Cloanthus, stretching both his open hands over the sea,"
2917,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,poured forth prayers and called the gods to hear his vows: 'Gods who are
2918,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"sovereign on the sea, over whose waters I run, to your altars on this"
2919,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"beach will I bring a snow-white bull, my vow's glad penalty, and will"
2920,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"cast his entrails into the salt flood and pour liquid wine.' He spoke,"
2921,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"and far beneath the flood maiden Panopea heard him, with all Phorcus'"
2922,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"choir of Nereids, and lord Portunus with his own mighty hand pushed him"
2923,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,on his way. The ship flies to land swifter than the wind or an arrow's
2924,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"flight, and shoots into the deep harbour. Then the seed of Anchises,"
2925,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"summoning all in order, declares Cloanthus conqueror by herald's outcry,"
2926,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"and dresses his brows in green bay, and gives gifts to each crew, three"
2927,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"bullocks of their choice, and wine, and a large talent of silver to take"
2928,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,away. For their captains he adds special honours; to the winner a scarf
2929,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"wrought with gold, encircled by a double border of deep Meliboean"
2930,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"purple; woven in it is the kingly boy on leafy Ida, chasing swift stags"
2931,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"with javelin and racing feet, keen and as one panting; him Jove's"
2932,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,swooping armour-bearer hath caught up from Ida in his talons; his aged
2933,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"guardians stretch their hands vainly upwards, and the barking of hounds"
2934,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"rings fierce into the air. But to him who, next in merit, held the"
2935,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"second place, he gives to wear a corslet triple-woven with hooks of"
2936,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"polished gold, stripped by his own conquering hand from Demoleos under"
2937,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"tall Troy by the swift SimoÃ¯s, an ornament and safeguard among arms."
2938,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,Scarce could the straining shoulders of his servants Phegeus and Sagaris
2939,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"carry its heavy folds; yet with it on, Demoleos at [265-302]full speed"
2940,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,would chase the scattered Trojans. The third prize he makes twin
2941,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"cauldrons of brass, and bowls wrought in silver and rough with tracery."
2942,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"And now all moved away in the pride and wealth of their prizes, their"
2943,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"brows bound with scarlet ribbons; when, hardly torn loose by all his art"
2944,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"from the cruel rock, his oars lost, rowing feebly with a single tier,"
2945,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,Sergestus brought in his ship jeered at and unhonoured. Even as often a
2946,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"serpent caught on a highway, if a brazen wheel hath gone aslant over him"
2947,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,or a wayfarer left him half dead and mangled with the blow of a heavy
2948,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"stone, wreathes himself slowly in vain effort to escape, in part"
2949,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"undaunted, his eyes ablaze and his hissing throat lifted high; in part"
2950,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,the disabling wound keeps him coiling in knots and twisting back on his
2951,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"own body; so the ship kept rowing slowly on, yet hoists sail and under"
2952,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,full sail glides into the harbour mouth. Glad that the ship is saved and
2953,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"the crew brought back, Aeneas presents Sergestus with his promised"
2954,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"reward. A slave woman is given him not unskilled in Minerva's labours,"
2955,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"PholoÃ« the Cretan, with twin boys at her breast."
2956,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,
2957,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"This contest sped, good Aeneas moved to a grassy plain girt all about"
2958,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"with winding wooded hills, and amid the valley an amphitheatre, whither,"
2959,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"with a concourse of many thousands, the hero advanced and took his seat"
2960,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,on a mound. Here he allures with rewards and offer of prizes those who
2961,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,will try their hap in the fleet foot-race. Trojans and Sicilians gather
2962,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"mingling from all sides, Nisus and Euryalus foremost . . . Euryalus in"
2963,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"the flower of youth and famed for beauty, Nisus for pure love of the"
2964,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"boy. Next follows renowned Diores, of Priam's royal line; after him"
2965,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Salius and Patron together, the one Acarnanian, the other Tegean by"
2966,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"family and of Arcadian blood; next two men of Sicily, Helymus and"
2967,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Panopes, foresters and attendants on old Acestes; many besides whose"
2968,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,fame is hid in [303-338]obscurity. Then among them all Aeneas spoke
2969,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"thus: 'Hearken to this, and attend in good cheer. None out of this"
2970,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,number will I let go without a gift. To each will I give two glittering
2971,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Gnosian spearheads of polished steel, and an axe chased with silver to"
2972,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,bear away; one and all shall be honoured thus. The three foremost shall
2973,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"receive prizes, and have pale olive bound about their head. The first"
2974,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,shall have a caparisoned horse as conqueror; the second an Amazonian
2975,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"quiver filled with arrows of Thrace, girt about by a broad belt of gold,"
2976,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,and on the link of the clasp a polished gem; let the third depart with
2977,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"this Argolic helmet for recompense.' This said, they take their place,"
2978,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"and the signal once heard, dart over the course and leave the line,"
2979,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,pouring forth like a storm-cloud while they mark the goal. Nisus gets
2980,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"away first, and shoots out far in front of the throng, fleeter than the"
2981,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"winds or the winged thunderbolt. Next to him, but next by a long gap,"
2982,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Salius follows; then, left a space behind him, Euryalus third . . . and"
2983,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Helymus comes after Euryalus; and close behind him, lo! Diores goes"
2984,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"flying, just grazing foot with foot, hard on his shoulder; and if a"
2985,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"longer space were left, he would creep out past him and win the tie. And"
2986,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"now almost in the last space, they began to come up breathless to the"
2987,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"goal, when unfortunate Nisus trips on the slippery blood of the slain"
2988,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"steers, where haply it had spilled over the ground and wetted the green"
2989,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"grass. Here, just in the flush of victory, he lost his feet; they slid"
2990,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"away on the ground they pressed, and he fell forward right among the"
2991,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,ordure and blood of the sacrifice. Yet forgot he not his darling
2992,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Euryalus; for rising, he flung himself over the slippery ground in front"
2993,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"of Salius, and he rolled over and lay all along on the hard sand."
2994,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Euryalus shoots by, wins and holds the first place his friend gave, and"
2995,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,flies on amid prosperous clapping and cheers. Behind Helymus comes
2996,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"[339-373]up, and Diores, now third for the palm. At this Salius fills"
2997,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"with loud clamour the whole concourse of the vast theatre, and the lords"
2998,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"who looked on in front, demanding restoration of his defrauded prize."
2999,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Euryalus is strong in favour, and beauty in tears, and the merit that"
3000,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"gains grace from so fair a form. Diores supports him, who succeeded to"
3001,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"the palm, so he loudly cries, and bore off the last prize in vain, if"
3002,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,the highest honours be restored to Salius. Then lord Aeneas speaks: 'For
3003,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"you, O boys, your rewards remain assured, and none alters the prizes'"
3004,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,order: let me be allowed to pity a friend's innocent mischance.' So
3005,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"speaking, he gives to Salius a vast Gaetulian lion-skin, with shaggy"
3006,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"masses of hair and claws of gold. 'If this,' cries Nisus, 'is the reward"
3007,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"of defeat, and thy pity is stirred for the fallen, what fit recompense"
3008,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"wilt thou give to Nisus? to my excellence the first crown was due, had"
3009,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"not I, like Salius, met Fortune's hostility.' And with the words he"
3010,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,displayed his face and limbs foul with the wet dung. His lord laughed
3011,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"kindly on him, and bade a shield be brought forth, the workmanship of"
3012,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Didymaon, torn by him from the hallowed gates of Neptune's Grecian"
3013,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,temple; with this special prize he rewards his excellence.
3014,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,
3015,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Thereafter, when the races are finished and the gifts fulfilled: 'Now,'"
3016,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"he cries, 'come, whoso hath in him valour and ready heart, and lift up"
3017,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"his arms with gauntleted hands.' So speaks he, and sets forth a double"
3018,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,prize of battle; for the conqueror a bullock gilt and garlanded; a sword
3019,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,and beautiful helmet to console the conquered. Straightway without pause
3020,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Dares issues to view in his vast strength, rising amid loud murmurs of"
3021,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"the people; he who alone was wont to meet Paris in combat; he who, at"
3022,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"the mound where princely Hector lies, struck down as he came the vast"
3023,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"bulk upborne by conquering Butes, of Amycus' Bebrycian line, and"
3024,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,stretched him in [374-410]death on the yellow sand. Such was Dares; at
3025,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"once he raises his head high for battle, displays his broad shoulders,"
3026,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"and stretches and swings his arms right and left, lashing the air with"
3027,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,blows. For him another is required; but none out of all the train durst
3028,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,approach or put the gloves on his hands. So he takes his stand exultant
3029,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"before Aeneas' feet, deeming he excelled all in victories; and thereon"
3030,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"without more delay grasps the bull's horn with his left hand, and speaks"
3031,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"thus: 'Goddess-born, if no man dare trust himself to battle, to what"
3032,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,conclusion shall I stand? how long is it seemly to keep me? bid me carry
3033,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"off thy gifts.' Therewith all the Dardanians murmured assent, and bade"
3034,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,yield him the promised prize. At this aged Acestes spoke sharply to
3035,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Entellus, as he sate next him on the green cushion of grass: 'Entellus,"
3036,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"bravest of heroes once of old in vain, wilt thou thus idly let a gift so"
3037,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"great be borne away uncontested? Where now prithee is divine Eryx, thy"
3038,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"master of fruitless fame? where thy renown over all Sicily, and those"
3039,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,spoils hanging in thine house?' Thereat he: 'Desire of glory is not
3040,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"gone, nor ambition checked by fear; but torpid age dulls my chilly"
3041,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"blood, and my strength of limb is numb and outworn. If I had what once"
3042,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"was mine, if I had now that prime of years, yonder braggart's boast and"
3043,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"confidence, it had taken no prize of goodly bullock to allure me; nor"
3044,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"heed I these gifts.' So he spoke, and on that flung down a pair of"
3045,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"gloves of giant weight, with whose hard hide bound about his wrists"
3046,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,valiant Eryx was wont to come to battle. They stood amazed; so stiff and
3047,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,grim lay the vast sevenfold oxhide sewed in with lead and iron. Dares
3048,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"most of all shrinks far back in horror, and the noble son of Anchises"
3049,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,turns round this way and that their vast weight and voluminous folds.
3050,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Then the old man spoke thus in deep accents: 'How, had they seen the"
3051,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"gloves [411-444]that were Hercules' own armour, and the fatal fight on"
3052,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,this very beach? These arms thy brother Eryx once wore; thou seest them
3053,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,yet stained with blood and spattered brains. In them he stood to face
3054,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,great Alcides; to them was I used while fuller blood supplied me
3055,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"strength, and envious old age had not yet strewn her snows on either"
3056,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"temple. But if Dares of Troy will have none of these our arms, and good"
3057,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Aeneas is resolved on it, and my patron Acestes approves, let us make"
3058,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"the battle even. See, I give up the gauntlets of Eryx; dismiss thy"
3059,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"fears; and do thou put off thy Trojan gloves.' So spoke he, and throwing"
3060,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"back the fold of his raiment from his shoulders, he bares the massive"
3061,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"joints and limbs, the great bones and muscles, and stands up huge in the"
3062,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,middle of the ground. Then Anchises' lordly seed brought out equal
3063,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,gloves and bound the hands of both in matched arms. Straightway each
3064,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"took his stand on tiptoe, and undauntedly raised his arms high in air."
3065,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"They lift their heads right back and away out of reach of blows, and"
3066,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"make hand play through hand, inviting attack; the one nimbler of foot"
3067,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"and confident in his youth, the other mighty in mass of limb, but his"
3068,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"knees totter tremulous and slow, and sick panting shakes his vast frame."
3069,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Many a mutual blow they deliver in vain, many an one they redouble on"
3070,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"chest and side, sounding hollow and loud: hands play fast about ear and"
3071,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"temple, and jawbones clash under the hard strokes. Old Entellus stands"
3072,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"immoveable and astrain, only parrying hits with body and watchful eye."
3073,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"The other, as one who casts mounts against some high city or blockades a"
3074,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"hill-fort in arms, tries this and that entrance, and ranges cunningly"
3075,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"over all the ground, and presses many an attack in vain. Entellus rose"
3076,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,and struck clean out with his right downwards; his quick opponent saw
3077,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"the descending blow before it came, [445-481]and slid his body rapidly"
3078,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"out of its way. Entellus hurled his strength into the air, and all his"
3079,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"heavy mass, overreaching, fell heavily to the earth; as sometime on"
3080,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,Erymanthus or mighty Ida a hollow pine falls torn out by the roots.
3081,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Teucrians and men of Sicily rise eagerly; a cry goes up, and Acestes"
3082,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"himself runs forward, and pityingly lifts his friend and birthmate from"
3083,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"the ground. But the hero, not dulled nor dismayed by his mishap, returns"
3084,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"the keener to battle, and grows violent in wrath, while shame and"
3085,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"resolved valour kindle his strength. All afire, he hunts Dares headlong"
3086,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"over the lists, and redoubles his blows now with right hand, now with"
3087,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,left; no breath nor pause; heavy as hailstones rattle on the roof from a
3088,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"storm-cloud, so thickly shower the blows from both his hands as he"
3089,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,buffets Dares to and fro. Then lord Aeneas allowed not wrath to swell
3090,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"higher or Entellus to rage out his bitterness, but stopped the fight and"
3091,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"rescued the exhausted Dares, saying thus in soothing words: 'Unhappy!"
3092,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,what height of madness hath seized thy mind? Knowest thou not the
3093,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,strength is another's and the gods are changed? Yield thou to Heaven.'
3094,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,And with the words he proclaimed the battle over. But him his faithful
3095,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"mates lead to the ships dragging his knees feebly, swaying his head from"
3096,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"side to side, and spitting from his mouth clotted blood mingled with"
3097,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"teeth. At summons they bear away the helmet and shield, and leave palm"
3098,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"and bull to Entellus. At this the conqueror, swelling in pride over the"
3099,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"bull, cries: 'Goddess-born, and you, O Trojans! learn thus what my"
3100,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"strength of body was in its prime, and from what a death Dares is saved"
3101,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"by your recall.' He spoke, and stood right opposite in face of the"
3102,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"bullock as it stood by, the prize of battle; then drew back his hand,"
3103,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"and swinging the hard gauntlet sheer down between the horns, smashed the"
3104,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"bones in upon the shattered brain. The ox rolls over, and quivering and"
3105,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,[482-516]lifeless lies along the ground. Above it he utters these deep
3106,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"accents: 'This life, Eryx, I give to thee, a better payment than Dares'"
3107,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,death; here I lay down my gloves and unconquered skill.'
3108,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,
3109,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,Forthwith Aeneas invites all that will to the contest of the swift
3110,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"arrow, and proclaims the prizes. With his strong hand he uprears the"
3111,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"mast of Serestus' ship, and on a cord crossing it hangs from the"
3112,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"masthead a fluttering pigeon as mark for their steel. They gather, and a"
3113,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"helmet of brass takes the lots as they throw them in. First in rank, and"
3114,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"before them all, amid prosperous cheers, comes out HippocoÃ¶n son of"
3115,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Hyrtacus; and Mnestheus follows on him, but now conqueror in the ship"
3116,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"race, Mnestheus with his chaplet of green olive. Third is Eurytion, thy"
3117,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"brother, O Pandarus, great in renown, thou who of old, when prompted to"
3118,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"shatter the truce, didst hurl the first shaft amid the Achaeans. Last of"
3119,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"all, and at the bottom of the helmet, sank Acestes, he too venturing to"
3120,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,set hand to the task of youth. Then each and all they strongly bend
3121,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,their bows into a curve and pull shafts from their quivers. And first
3122,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"the arrow of the son of Hyrtacus, flying through heaven from the"
3123,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"sounding string, whistles through the fleet breezes, and reaches and"
3124,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"sticks fast full in the mast's wood: the mast quivered, and the bird"
3125,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"fluttered her feathers in affright, and the whole ground rang with loud"
3126,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"clapping. Next valiant Mnestheus took his stand with bow bent, aiming"
3127,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"high with levelled eye and arrow; yet could not, unfortunate! hit the"
3128,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"bird herself with his steel, but cut the knotted hempen bands that tied"
3129,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,her foot as she hung from the masthead; she winged her flight into the
3130,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"dark windy clouds. Then Eurytion, who ere now held the arrow ready on"
3131,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"his bended bow, swiftly called in prayer to his brother, marked the"
3132,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,pigeon as she now went down the empty sky exultant on clapping wings;
3133,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"and as she passed under a dark cloud, [517-553]struck her: she fell"
3134,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"breathless, and, leaving her life in the aery firmament, slid down"
3135,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"carrying the arrow that pierced her. Acestes alone was over, and the"
3136,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"prize lost; yet he sped his arrow up into the air, to display his lordly"
3137,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"skill and resounding bow. At this a sudden sign meets their eyes, mighty"
3138,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"in augural presage, as the high event taught thereafter, and in late"
3139,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,days boding seers prophesied of the omen. For the flying reed blazed out
3140,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"amid the swimming clouds, traced its path in flame, and burned away on"
3141,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,the light winds; even as often stars shooting from their sphere draw a
3142,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"train athwart the sky. Trinacrians and Trojans hung in astonishment,"
3143,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,praying to the heavenly powers; neither did great Aeneas reject the
3144,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"omen, but embraces glad Acestes and loads him with lavish gifts,"
3145,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"speaking thus: 'Take, my lord: for the high King of heaven by these"
3146,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,signs hath willed thee to draw the lot of peculiar honour. This gift
3147,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"shalt thou have as from aged Anchises' own hand, a bowl embossed with"
3148,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"figures, that once Cisseus of Thrace gave my father Anchises to bear, in"
3149,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"high token and guerdon of affection.' So speaking, he twines green bay"
3150,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"about his brows, and proclaims Acestes conqueror first before them all."
3151,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Nor did gentle Eurytion, though he alone struck the bird down from the"
3152,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"lofty sky, grudge him to be preferred in honour. Next comes for his"
3153,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"prize he who cut the cord; he last, who pierced the mast with his winged"
3154,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,reed.
3155,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,
3156,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"But lord Aeneas, ere yet the contest is sped, calls to him Epytides,"
3157,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"guardian and attendant of ungrown IÃ¼lus, and thus speaks into his"
3158,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"faithful ear: 'Up and away, and tell Ascanius, if he now holds his band"
3159,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"of boys ready, and their horses arrayed for the charge, to defile his"
3160,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"squadrons to his grandsire's honour in bravery of arms.' So says he, and"
3161,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,himself bids all the crowding throng withdraw from the long racecourse
3162,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"and leave the lists free. The boys move in before their parents' faces,"
3163,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,glittering in rank on their [554-590]bitted horses; as they go all the
3164,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,people of Troy and Trinacria murmur and admire. On the hair of them all
3165,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,rests a garland fitly trimmed; each carries two cornel spear-shafts
3166,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,tipped with steel; some have polished quivers on their shoulders; above
3167,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,their breast and round their neck goes a flexible circlet of twisted
3168,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"gold. Three in number are the troops of riders, and three captains"
3169,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,gallop up and down; following each in equal command rides a glittering
3170,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,division of twelve boys. One youthful line goes rejoicingly behind
3171,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"little Priam, renewer of his grandsire's name, thy renowned seed, O"
3172,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Polites, and destined to people Italy; he rides a Thracian horse dappled"
3173,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"with spots of white, showing white on his pacing pasterns and white on"
3174,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"his high forehead. Second is Atys, from whom the Latin Atii draw their"
3175,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"line, little Atys, boy beloved of the boy IÃ¼lus. Last and excellent in"
3176,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"beauty before them all, IÃ¼lus rode in on a Sidonian horse that Dido the"
3177,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,bright had given him for token and pledge of love. The rest of them are
3178,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,mounted on old Acestes' Sicilian horses. . . . The Dardanians greet
3179,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"their shy entrance with applause, and rejoice at the view, and recognise"
3180,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,the features of their parents of old. When they have ridden merrily
3181,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"round all the concourse of their gazing friends, Epytides shouts from"
3182,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"afar the signal they await, and sounds his whip. They gallop apart in"
3183,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"equal numbers, and open their files three and three in deploying bands,"
3184,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,and again at the call wheel about and bear down with levelled arms. Next
3185,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"they start on other charges and other retreats in corresponsive spaces,"
3186,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"and interlink circle with circle, and wage the armed phantom of battle."
3187,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"And now they bare their backs in flight, now turn their lances to the"
3188,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"charge, now plight peace and ride on side by side. As once of old, they"
3189,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"say, the labyrinth in high Crete had a tangled path between blind walls,"
3190,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"and a thousand ways of doubling treachery, where tokens to follow failed"
3191,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,in the [591-625]maze unmastered and irrecoverable: even in such a track
3192,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,do the children of Troy entangle their footsteps and weave the game of
3193,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"flight and battle; like dolphins who, swimming through the wet seas, cut"
3194,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,Carpathian or Libyan. . . .
3195,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,
3196,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"This fashion of riding, these games Ascanius first revived, when he girt"
3197,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Alba the Long about with walls, and taught their celebration to the Old"
3198,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Latins in the way of his own boyhood, with the youth of Troy about him."
3199,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,The Albans taught it their children; on from them mighty Rome received
3200,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"it and kept the ancestral observance; and now it is called Troy, and the"
3201,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,boys the Trojan troop.
3202,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,
3203,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,Thus far sped the sacred contests to their holy lord. Just at this
3204,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,Fortune broke faith and grew estranged. While they pay the due rites to
3205,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"the tomb with diverse games, Juno, daughter of Saturn, sends Iris down"
3206,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"the sky to the Ilian fleet, and breathes a gale to speed her on,"
3207,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"revolving many a thought, and not yet satiate of the ancient pain. She,"
3208,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"speeding her way along the thousand-coloured bow, runs swiftly, seen of"
3209,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"none, down her maiden path. She discerns the vast concourse, and"
3210,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"traverses the shore, and sees the haven abandoned and the fleet left"
3211,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,alone. But far withdrawn by the solitary verge of the sea the Trojan
3212,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"women wept their lost Anchises, and as they wept gazed all together on"
3213,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"the fathomless flood. 'Alas! after all those weary waterways, that so"
3214,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,wide a sea is yet to come!' such is the single cry of all. They pray for
3215,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"a city, sick of the burden of their sea-sorrow. So she darts among them,"
3216,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"not witless to harm, and lays by face and raiment of a goddess: she"
3217,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"becomes BeroÃ«, the aged wife of Tmarian Doryclus, who had once had birth"
3218,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"and name and children, and in this guise goes among the Dardanian"
3219,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"matrons. 'Ah, wretched we,' she cries, 'whom hostile Achaean hands did"
3220,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"not drag to death beneath our native city! ah hapless race, for what"
3221,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,destruction does Fortune hold thee back? The [626-660]seventh summer
3222,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"now declines since Troy's overthrow, while we pass measuring out by so"
3223,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"many stars the harbourless rocks over every water and land, pursuing all"
3224,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"the while over the vast sea an Italy that flies us, and tossing on the"
3225,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"waves. Here are our brother Eryx' borders, and Acestes' welcome: who"
3226,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"denies us to cast up walls and give our citizens a city? O country, O"
3227,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,household gods vainly rescued from the foe! shall there never be a
3228,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Trojan town to tell of? shall I nowhere see a Xanthus and a SimoÃ¯s, the"
3229,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"rivers of Hector? Nay, up and join me in burning with fire these"
3230,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,ill-ominous ships. For in sleep the phantom of Cassandra the soothsayer
3231,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"seemed to give me blazing brands: _Here seek your Troy_, she said; _here"
3232,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,is your home_. Now is the time to do it; nor do these high portents
3233,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,allow delay. Behold four altars to Neptune; the god himself lends the
3234,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"firebrand and the nerve.' Speaking thus, at once she strongly seizes the"
3235,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"fiery weapon, and with straining hand whirls it far upreared, and"
3236,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,flings: the souls of the Ilian women are startled and their wits amazed.
3237,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"At this one of their multitude, and she the eldest, Pyrgo, nurse in the"
3238,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"palace to all Priam's many children: 'This is not BeroÃ«, I tell you, O"
3239,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,mothers; this is not the wife of Doryclus of Rhoeteum. Mark the
3240,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"lineaments of divine grace and the gleaming eyes, what a breath is hers,"
3241,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"what a countenance, and the sound of her voice and the steps of her"
3242,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"going. I, I time agone left BeroÃ« apart, sick and fretting that she"
3243,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"alone must have no part in this our service, nor pay Anchises his due"
3244,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"sacrifice.' So spoke she. . . . But the matrons at first, dubious and"
3245,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"wavering, gazed on the ships with malignant eyes, between the wretched"
3246,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,longing for the land they trod and the fated realm that summoned them:
3247,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"when the goddess rose through the sky on poised wings, and in her flight"
3248,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"drew a vast bow beneath the clouds. Then indeed, amazed at the tokens"
3249,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"and driven by madness, they raise a cry and snatch fire from the"
3250,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"[661-694]hearths within; others plunder the altars, and cast on"
3251,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,brushwood boughs and brands. The Fire-god rages with loose rein over
3252,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,thwarts and oars and hulls of painted fir. Eumelus carries the news of
3253,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,the burning ships to the grave of Anchises and the ranges of the
3254,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"theatre; and looking back, their own eyes see the floating cloud of dark"
3255,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"ashes. And in a moment Ascanius, as he rode gaily before his cavalry,"
3256,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,spurred his horse to the disordered camp; nor can his breathless
3257,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,guardians hold him back. 'What strange madness is this?' he cries;
3258,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"'whither now hasten you, whither, alas and woe! O citizens? not on the"
3259,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,foe nor on some hostile Argive camp; it is your own hopes you burn.
3260,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Behold me, your Ascanius!' and he flung before his feet the empty"
3261,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"helmet, put on when he roused the mimicry of war. Aeneas and the Trojan"
3262,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,train together hurry to the spot. But the women scatter apart in fear
3263,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"all over the beach, and stealthily seek the woods and the hollow rocks"
3264,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"they find: they loathe their deed and the daylight, and with changed"
3265,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"eyes know their people, and Juno is startled out of their breast. But"
3266,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,not thereby do the flames of the burning lay down their unconquered
3267,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"strength; under the wet oak the seams are alive, spouting slow coils of"
3268,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"smoke; the creeping heat devours the hulls, and the destroyer takes deep"
3269,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,hold of all: nor does the heroes' strength avail nor the floods they
3270,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,pour in. Then good Aeneas rent away the raiment from his shoulders and
3271,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"called the gods to aid, stretching forth his hands: 'Jupiter omnipotent,"
3272,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"if thou hatest not Troy yet wholly to her last man, if thine ancient"
3273,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"pity looks at all on human woes, now, O Lord, grant our fleet to escape"
3274,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"the flame, and rescue from doom the slender Teucrian estate. Or do thou"
3275,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"plunge to death this remnant, if I deserve it, with levelled"
3276,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"thunderbolt, and here with thine own hand smite us down.' Scarce had he"
3277,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"uttered this, when a black tempest rages in streaming showers; earth"
3278,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,trembles [695-726]to the thunder on plain and steep; the water-flood
3279,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,rushes in torrents from the whole heaven amid black darkness and
3280,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"volleying blasts of the South. The ships are filled from overhead, the"
3281,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"half-burnt timbers are soaking; till all the heat is quenched, and all"
3282,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"the hulls, but four that are lost, are rescued from destruction."
3283,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,
3284,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"But lord Aeneas, dismayed by the bitter mischance, revolved at heart"
3285,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"this way and that his shifting weight of care, whether, forgetting fate,"
3286,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"he should rest in Sicilian fields, or reach forth to the borders of"
3287,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Italy. Then old Nautes, whom Tritonian Pallas taught like none other,"
3288,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,and made famous in eminence of art--she granted him to reply what the
3289,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,gods' heavy anger menaced or what the order of fate claimed--he then in
3290,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,accents of comfort thus speaks to Aeneas:
3291,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,
3292,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"'Goddess-born, follow we fate's ebb and flow, whatsoever it shall be;"
3293,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,fortune must be borne to be overcome. Acestes is of thine own divine
3294,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Dardanian race; take him, for he is willing, to join thee in common"
3295,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"counsel; deliver to him those who are over, now these ships are lost,"
3296,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,and those who are quite weary of thy fortunes and the great quest.
3297,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Choose out the old men stricken in years, and the matrons sick of the"
3298,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"sea, and all that is weak and fearful of peril in thy company. Let this"
3299,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,land give a city to the weary; they shall be allowed to call their town
3300,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,Acesta by name.'
3301,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,
3302,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Then, indeed, kindled by these words of his aged friend, his spirit is"
3303,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"distracted among all his cares. And now black Night rose chariot-borne,"
3304,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,and held the sky; when the likeness of his father Anchises seemed to
3305,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,descend from heaven and suddenly utter thus:
3306,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,
3307,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"'O son, more dear to me than life once of old while life was yet mine; O"
3308,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"son, hard wrought by the destinies of Ilium! I come hither by Jove's"
3309,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"command, who drove the [727-760]fire from thy fleets, and at last had"
3310,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,pity out of high heaven. Obey thou the fair counsel aged Nautes now
3311,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,gives. Carry through to Italy thy chosen men and bravest souls; in
3312,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,Latium must thou war down a people hard and rough in living. Yet ere
3313,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"then draw thou nigh the nether chambers of Dis, and in the deep tract of"
3314,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"hell come, O son, to meet me. For I am not held in cruel Tartarus among"
3315,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"wailing ghosts, but inhabit Elysium and the sweet societies of the good."
3316,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,Hither with much blood of dark cattle shall the holy Sibyl lead thee.
3317,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Then shalt thou learn of all thy line, and what city is given thee. And"
3318,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"now farewell; dank Night wheels her mid-career, and even now I feel the"
3319,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"stern breath of the panting horses of the East.' He ended, and retreated"
3320,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"like a vapour into thin air. 'Ah, whither hurriest thou?' cries Aeneas;"
3321,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,'whither so fast away? From whom fliest thou? or who withholds thee from
3322,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"our embrace?' So speaking, he kindles the sleeping embers of the fire,"
3323,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,and with holy meal and laden censer does sacrifice to the tutelar of
3324,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,Pergama and hoar Vesta's secret shrine.
3325,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,
3326,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Straightway he summons his crews and Acestes first of all, and instructs"
3327,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"them of Jove's command and his beloved father's precepts, and what is"
3328,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"now his fixed mind and purpose. They linger not in counsel, nor does"
3329,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Acestes decline his bidden duty: they enrol the matrons in their town,"
3330,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"and plant a people there, souls that will have none of glory. The rest"
3331,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,repair the thwarts and replace the ships' timbers that the flames had
3332,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"gnawed upon, and fit up oars and rigging, little in number, but alive"
3333,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,and valiant for war. Meanwhile Aeneas traces the town with the plough
3334,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"and allots the homesteads; this he bids be Ilium, and these lands Troy."
3335,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Trojan Acestes, rejoicing in his kingdom, appoints a court and gathers"
3336,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"his senators to give them statutes. Next, where the crest of Eryx is"
3337,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"neighbour to the stars, a dwelling is founded to Venus the Idalian;"
3338,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,[761-793]and a priest and breadth of holy wood is attached to Anchises'
3339,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,grave.
3340,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,
3341,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"And now for nine days all the people hath feasted, and offering been"
3342,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"paid at the altars; quiet breezes have smoothed the ocean floor, and the"
3343,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"gathering south wind blows, calling them again to sea. A mighty weeping"
3344,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,arises along the winding shore; a night and a day they linger in mutual
3345,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"embraces. The very mothers now, the very men to whom once the sight of"
3346,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"the sea seemed cruel and the name intolerable, would go on and endure"
3347,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,the journey's travail to the end. These Aeneas comforts with kindly
3348,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"words, and commends with tears to his kinsman Acestes' care. Then he"
3349,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"bids slay three steers to Eryx and a she-lamb to the Tempests, and loose"
3350,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"the hawser as is due. Himself, his head bound with stripped leaves of"
3351,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"olive, he stands apart on the prow holding the cup, and casts the"
3352,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,entrails into the salt flood and pours liquid wine. A wind rising astern
3353,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"follows them forth on their way. Emulously the crews strike the water,"
3354,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,and sweep through the seas.
3355,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,
3356,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"But Venus meanwhile, wrought upon with distress, accosts Neptune, and"
3357,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,thus pours forth her heart's complaint: 'Juno's bitter wrath and heart
3358,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"insatiable compel me, O Neptune, to sink to the uttermost of entreaty:"
3359,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"neither length of days nor any goodness softens her, nor doth Jove's"
3360,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,command and fate itself break her to desistence. It is not enough that
3361,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,her accursed hatred hath devoured the Phrygian city from among the
3362,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"people, and exhausted on it the stores of vengeance; still she pursues"
3363,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"this remnant, the bones and ashes of murdered Troy. I pray she know why"
3364,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,her passion is so fierce. Thyself art my witness what a sudden stir she
3365,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"raised of late on the Libyan waters, flinging all the seas to heaven in"
3366,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,vain reliance on Aeolus' blasts; this she dared in thy realm. . . .
3367,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Lo too, driving the Trojan matrons into guilt, she hath foully"
3368,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"[794-826]burned their ships, and forced them, their fleet lost, to"
3369,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"leave the crews to an unknown land. Let the remnant, I beseech thee,"
3370,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,give their sails to thy safe keeping across the seas; let them reach
3371,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Laurentine Tiber; if I ask what is permitted, if fate grants them a city"
3372,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,there.'
3373,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,
3374,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Then the son of Saturn, compeller of the ocean deep, uttered thus: 'It"
3375,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"is wholly right, O Cytherean, that thy trust should be in my realm,"
3376,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,whence thou drawest birth; and I have deserved it: often have I allayed
3377,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"the rage and full fury of sky and sea. Nor less on land, I call Xanthus"
3378,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"and SimoÃ¯s to witness, hath been my care of thine Aeneas. When Achilles"
3379,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"pursued the Trojan armies and hurled them breathless on their walls, and"
3380,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"sent many thousands to death,--when the choked rivers groaned and"
3381,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Xanthus could not find passage or roll out to sea,--then I snatched"
3382,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,Aeneas away in sheltering mist as he met the brave son of Peleus
3383,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"outmatched in strength and gods, eager as I was to overthrow the walls"
3384,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,of perjured Troy that mine own hands had built. Now too my mind rests
3385,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"the same; dismiss thy fear. In safety, as thou desirest, shall he reach"
3386,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,the haven of Avernus. One will there be alone whom on the flood thou
3387,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,shalt lose and require; one life shall be given for many. . . .'
3388,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,
3389,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,With these words the goddess' bosom is soothed to joy. Then their lord
3390,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"yokes his wild horses with gold and fastens the foaming bits, and"
3391,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"letting all the reins run slack in his hand, flies lightly in his"
3392,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"sea-coloured chariot over the ocean surface. The waves sink to rest, and"
3393,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,the swoln water-ways smooth out under the thundering axle; the
3394,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"storm-clouds scatter from the vast sky. Diverse shapes attend him,"
3395,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"monstrous whales, and Glaucus' aged choir, and Palaemon, son of Ino, the"
3396,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"swift Tritons, and Phorcus with all his army. Thetis and Melite keep the"
3397,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"left, and maiden Panopea, Nesaea and Spio, Thalia and Cymodoce."
3398,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,
3399,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,[827-860]At this lord Aeneas' soul is thrilled with soft counterchange
3400,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"of delight. He bids all the masts be upreared with speed, and the sails"
3401,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"stretched on the yards. Together all set their sheets, and all at once"
3402,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,slacken their canvas to left and again to right; together they brace and
3403,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,unbrace the yard-arms aloft; prosperous gales waft the fleet along.
3404,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"First, in front of all, Palinurus steered the close column; the rest"
3405,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,under orders ply their course by his. And now dewy Night had just
3406,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"reached heaven's mid-cone; the sailors, stretched on their hard benches"
3407,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"under the oars, relaxed their limbs in quiet rest: when Sleep, sliding"
3408,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"lightly down from the starry sky, parted the shadowy air and cleft the"
3409,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"dark, seeking thee, O Palinurus, carrying dreams of bale to thee who"
3410,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"dreamt not of harm, and lit on the high stern, a god in Phorbas'"
3411,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"likeness, dropping this speech from his lips: 'Palinurus son of Iasus,"
3412,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,the very seas bear our fleet along; the breezes breathe steadily; for an
3413,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"hour rest is given. Lay down thine head, and steal thy worn eyes from"
3414,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,their toil. I myself for a little will take thy duty in thy stead.' To
3415,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"whom Palinurus, scarcely lifting his eyes, returns: 'Wouldst thou have"
3416,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"me ignorant what the calm face of the brine means, and the waves at"
3417,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,rest? Shall I have faith in this perilous thing? How shall I trust
3418,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Aeneas to deceitful breezes, and the placid treachery of sky that hath"
3419,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"so often deceived me?' Such words he uttered, and, clinging fast to the"
3420,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"tiller, slackened hold no whit, and looked up steadily on the stars. Lo!"
3421,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,the god shakes over either temple a bough dripping with Lethean dew and
3422,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"made slumberous with the might of Styx, and makes his swimming eyes"
3423,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,relax their struggles. Scarcely had sleep begun to slacken his limbs
3424,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"unaware, when bending down, he flung him sheer into the clear water,"
3425,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"tearing rudder and half the stern away with him, and many a time crying"
3426,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,vainly on his comrades: himself [861-871]he rose on flying wings into
3427,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"the thin air. None the less does the fleet run safe on its sea path, and"
3428,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"glides on unalarmed in lord Neptune's assurance. Yes, and now they were"
3429,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"sailing in to the cliffs of the Sirens, dangerous once of old and white"
3430,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,with the bones of many a man; and the hoarse rocks echoed afar in the
3431,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,ceaseless surf; when her lord felt the ship rocking astray for loss of
3432,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"her helmsman, and himself steered her on over the darkling water,"
3433,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"sighing often the while, and heavy at heart for his friend's mischance."
3434,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"'Ah too trustful in sky's and sea's serenity, thou shalt lie, O"
3435,THE GAMES OF THE FLEET,"Palinurus, naked on an alien sand!'"

3443,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3444,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3445,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"So speaks he weeping, and gives his fleet the rein, and at last glides"
3446,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,in to EuboÃ¯c Cumae's coast. They turn the prows seaward; the ships
3447,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"grounded fast on their anchors' teeth, and the curving ships line the"
3448,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,beach. The warrior band leaps forth eagerly on the Hesperian shore; some
3449,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"seek the seeds of flame hidden in veins of flint, some scour the woods,"
3450,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"the thick coverts of wild beasts, and find and shew the streams. But"
3451,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"good Aeneas seeks the fortress where Apollo sits high enthroned, and the"
3452,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"lone mystery of the awful Sibyl's cavern depth, over whose mind and soul"
3453,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,the prophetic Delian breathes high inspiration and reveals futurity.
3454,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3455,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Now they draw nigh the groves of Trivia and the roof of gold. Daedalus,"
3456,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"as the story runs, when in flight from Minos' realm he dared to spread"
3457,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"his fleet wings to the sky, glided on his unwonted way towards the icy"
3458,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"northern star, and at length lit gently on the Chalcidian fastness."
3459,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Here, on the first land he retrod, he dedicated his winged oarage to"
3460,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"thee, O Phoebus, in the vast temple he built. On the doors is Androgeus'"
3461,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"death; thereby the children of Cecrops, bidden, ah me! to pay for yearly"
3462,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"ransom seven souls of their sons; the urn stands there, and the lots are"
3463,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,drawn. Right [23-55]opposite the land of Gnosus rises from the sea; on
3464,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"it is the cruel love of the bull, the disguised stealth of PasiphaÃ«, and"
3465,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"the mingled breed and double issue of the Minotaur, record of a shameful"
3466,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,passion; on it the famous dwelling's laborious inextricable maze; but
3467,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Daedalus, pitying the great love of the princess, himself unlocked the"
3468,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"tangled treachery of the palace, guiding with the clue her lover's blind"
3469,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"footsteps. Thou too hadst no slight part in the work he wrought, O"
3470,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Icarus, did grief allow. Twice had he essayed to portray thy fate in"
3471,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"gold; twice the father's hands dropped down. Nay, their eyes would scan"
3472,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"all the story in order, were not Achates already returned from his"
3473,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"errand, and with him the priestess of Phoebus and Trivia, DeÃ¯phobe"
3474,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"daughter of Glaucus, who thus accosts the king: 'Other than this are the"
3475,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,sights the time demands: now were it well to sacrifice seven unbroken
3476,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"bullocks of the herd, as many fitly chosen sheep of two years old.' Thus"
3477,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,speaks she to Aeneas; nor do they delay to do her sacred bidding; and
3478,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,the priestess calls the Teucrians into the lofty shrine.
3479,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3480,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"A vast cavern is scooped in the side of the EuboÃ¯c cliff, whither lead"
3481,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"an hundred wide passages by an hundred gates, whence peal forth as"
3482,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"manifold the responses of the Sibyl. They had reached the threshold,"
3483,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"when the maiden cries: _It is time to enquire thy fate: the god, lo! the"
3484,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"god!_ And even as she spoke thus in the gateway, suddenly countenance"
3485,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,nor colour nor ranged tresses stayed the same; her wild heart heaves
3486,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"madly in her panting bosom; and she expands to sight, and her voice is"
3487,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"more than mortal, now the god breathes on her in nearer deity."
3488,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"'Lingerest thou to vow and pray,' she cries, 'Aeneas of Troy? lingerest"
3489,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,thou? for not till then will the vast portals of the spellbound house
3490,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"swing open.' So spoke she, and sank to silence. A cold shiver ran"
3491,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"through the Teucrians' iron frames, and the king pours heart-deep"
3492,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,supplication:
3493,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3494,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"[56-89]'Phoebus, who hast ever pitied the sore travail of Troy, who"
3495,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,didst guide the Dardanian shaft from Paris' hand full on the son of
3496,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Aeacus, in thy leading have I pierced all these seas that skirt mighty"
3497,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"lands, the Massylian nations far withdrawn, and the fields the Syrtes"
3498,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,fringe; thus far let the fortune of Troy follow us. You too may now
3499,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"unforbidden spare the nation of Pergama, gods and goddesses to"
3500,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"whomsoever Ilium and the great glory of Dardania did wrong. And thou, O"
3501,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"prophetess most holy, foreknower of the future, grant (for no unearned"
3502,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"realm does my destiny claim) a resting-place in Latium to the Teucrians,"
3503,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,to their wandering gods and the storm-tossed deities of Troy. Then will
3504,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"I ordain to Phoebus and Trivia a temple of solid marble, and festal days"
3505,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,in Phoebus' name. Thee likewise a mighty sanctuary awaits in our realm.
3506,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,For here will I place thine oracles and the secrets of destiny uttered
3507,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"to my people, and consecrate chosen men, O gracious one. Only commit not"
3508,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"thou thy verses to leaves, lest they fly disordered, the sport of"
3509,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"rushing winds; thyself utter them, I beseech thee.' His lips made an end"
3510,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,of utterance.
3511,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3512,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"But the prophetess, not yet tame to Phoebus' hand, rages fiercely in the"
3513,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"cavern, so she may shake the mighty godhead from her breast; so much the"
3514,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,more does he tire her maddened mouth and subdue her wild breast and
3515,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,shape her to his pressure. And now the hundred mighty portals of the
3516,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"house open of their own accord, and bring through the air the answer of"
3517,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,the soothsayer:
3518,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3519,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,'O past at length with the great perils of the sea! though heavier yet
3520,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"by land await thee, the Dardanians shall come to the realm of Lavinium;"
3521,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,relieve thy heart of this care; but not so shall they have joy of their
3522,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"coming. Wars, grim wars I discern, and Tiber afoam with streams of"
3523,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"blood. A SimoÃ¯s shall not fail thee, a Xanthus, a Dorian camp; another"
3524,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Achilles is already found for Latium, he too [90-123]goddess-born; nor"
3525,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"shall Juno's presence ever leave the Teucrians; while thou in thy need,"
3526,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,to what nations or what towns of Italy shalt thou not sue! Again is an
3527,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"alien bride the source of all that Teucrian woe, again a foreign"
3528,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"marriage-chamber. . . . Yield not thou to distresses, but all the bolder"
3529,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"go forth to meet them, as thy fortune shall allow thee way. The path of"
3530,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"rescue, little as thou deemest it, shall first open from a Grecian"
3531,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,town.'
3532,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3533,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,In such words the Sibyl of Cumae chants from the shrine her perplexing
3534,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"terrors, echoing through the cavern truth wrapped in obscurity: so does"
3535,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,Apollo clash the reins and ply the goad in her maddened breast. So soon
3536,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"as the spasm ceased and the raving lips sank to silence, Aeneas the hero"
3537,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"begins: 'No shape of toil, O maiden, rises strange or sudden on my"
3538,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,sight; all this ere now have I guessed and inly rehearsed in spirit. One
3539,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"thing I pray; since here is the gate named of the infernal king, and the"
3540,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"darkling marsh of Acheron's overflow, be it given me to go to my beloved"
3541,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"father, to see him face to face; teach thou the way, and open the"
3542,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,consecrated portals. Him on these shoulders I rescued from encircling
3543,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"flames and a thousand pursuing weapons, and brought him safe from amid"
3544,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"the enemy; he accompanied my way over all the seas, and bore with me all"
3545,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"the threats of ocean and sky, in weakness, beyond his age's strength and"
3546,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"due. Nay, he it was who besought and enjoined me to seek thy grace and"
3547,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"draw nigh thy courts. Have pity, I beseech thee, on son and father, O"
3548,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"gracious one! for thou art all-powerful, nor in vain hath Hecate given"
3549,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,thee rule in the groves of Avernus. If Orpheus could call up his wife's
3550,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,ghost in the strength of his Thracian lyre and the music of the
3551,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"strings,--if Pollux redeemed his brother by exchange of death, and"
3552,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"passes and repasses so often,--why make mention of great Theseus, why of"
3553,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,Alcides? I too am of Jove's sovereign race.'
3554,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3555,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,[124-157]In such words he pleaded and clasped the altars; when the
3556,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,soothsayer thus began to speak:
3557,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3558,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"'O sprung of gods' blood, child of Anchises of Troy, easy is the descent"
3559,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,into hell; all night and day the gate of dark Dis stands open; but to
3560,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"recall thy steps and issue to upper air, this is the task and burden."
3561,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Some few of gods' lineage have availed, such as Jupiter's gracious"
3562,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,favour or virtue's ardour hath upborne to heaven. Midway all is muffled
3563,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"in forest, and the black coils of Cocytus circle it round. Yet if thy"
3564,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,soul is so passionate and so desirous twice to float across the Stygian
3565,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"lake, twice to see dark Tartarus, and thy pleasure is to plunge into the"
3566,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"mad task, learn what must first be accomplished. Hidden in a shady tree"
3567,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"is a bough with leafage and pliant shoot all of gold, consecrate to"
3568,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"nether Juno, wrapped in the depth of woodland and shut in by dim dusky"
3569,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,vales. But to him only who first hath plucked the golden-tressed
3570,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,fruitage from the tree is it given to enter the hidden places of the
3571,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,earth. This hath beautiful Proserpine ordained to be borne to her for
3572,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"her proper gift. The first torn away, a second fills the place in gold,"
3573,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,and the spray burgeons with even such ore again. So let thine eyes trace
3574,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"it home, and thine hand pluck it duly when found; for lightly and"
3575,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,unreluctant will it follow if thine is fate's summons; else will no
3576,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,strength of thine avail to conquer it nor hard steel to cut it away. Yet
3577,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"again, a friend of thine lies a lifeless corpse, alas! thou knowest it"
3578,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"not, and defiles all the fleet with death, while thou seekest our"
3579,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,counsel and lingerest in our courts. First lay him in his resting-place
3580,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,and hide him in the tomb; lead thither black cattle; be this first thine
3581,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,expiation; so at last shalt thou behold the Stygian groves and the realm
3582,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"untrodden of the living.' She spoke, and her lips shut to silence."
3583,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3584,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Aeneas goes forth, and leaves the cavern with fixed eyes and sad"
3585,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"countenance, his soul revolving inly the unseen [158-194]issues. By his"
3586,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"side goes faithful Achates, and plants his footsteps in equal"
3587,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,perplexity. Long they ran on in mutual change of talk; of what lifeless
3588,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"comrade spoke the soothsayer, of what body for burial? And even as they"
3589,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"came, they see on the dry beach Misenus cut off by untimely death,"
3590,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Misenus the Aeolid, excelled of none other in stirring men with brazen"
3591,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,breath and kindling battle with his trumpet-note. He had been attendant
3592,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"on mighty Hector; in Hector's train he waged battle, renowned alike for"
3593,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,bugle and spear: after victorious Achilles robbed him of life the
3594,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"valiant hero had joined Dardanian Aeneas' company, and followed no"
3595,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"meaner leader. But now, while he makes his hollow shell echo over the"
3596,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"seas, ah fool! and calls the gods to rival his blast, jealous Triton, if"
3597,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"belief is due, had caught him among the rocks and sunk him in the"
3598,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"foaming waves. So all surrounded him with loud murmur and cries, good"
3599,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,Aeneas the foremost. Then weeping they quickly hasten on the Sibyl's
3600,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"orders, and work hard to pile trees for the altar of burial, and heap it"
3601,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"up into the sky. They move into the ancient forest, the deep coverts of"
3602,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"game; pitch-pines fall flat, ilex rings to the stroke of axes, and ashen"
3603,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,beams and oak are split in clefts with wedges; they roll in huge
3604,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"mountain-ashes from the hills. Aeneas likewise is first in the work, and"
3605,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,cheers on his crew and arms himself with their weapons. And alone with
3606,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"his sad heart he ponders it all, gazing on the endless forest, and"
3607,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,utters this prayer: 'If but now that bough of gold would shew itself to
3608,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,us on the tree in this depth of woodland! since all the soothsayer's
3609,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"tale of thee, Misenus, was, alas! too truly spoken.' Scarcely had he"
3610,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"said thus, when twin doves haply came flying down the sky, and lit on"
3611,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,the green sod right under his eyes. Then the kingly hero knows them for
3612,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"his mother's birds, and joyfully prays: 'Ah, be my guides, if way there"
3613,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"be, and direct your aÃ«ry passage into the groves [195-230]where the"
3614,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"rich bough overshadows the fertile ground! and thou, O goddess mother,"
3615,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"fail not our wavering fortune.' So spoke he and stayed his steps,"
3616,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"marking what they signify, whither they urge their way. Feeding and"
3617,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,flying they advance at such distance as following eyes could keep them
3618,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"in view; then, when they came to Avernus' pestilent gorge, they tower"
3619,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"swiftly, and sliding down through the liquid air, choose their seat and"
3620,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"light side by side on a tree, through whose boughs shone out the"
3621,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,contrasting flicker of gold. As in chill mid-winter the woodland is wont
3622,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"to blossom with the strange leafage of the mistletoe, sown on an alien"
3623,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,tree and wreathing the smooth stems with burgeoning saffron; so on the
3624,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"shadowy ilex seemed that leafy gold, so the foil tinkled in the light"
3625,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,breeze. Immediately Aeneas seizes it and eagerly breaks off its
3626,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"resistance, and carries it beneath the Sibyl's roof."
3627,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3628,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"And therewithal the Teucrians on the beach wept Misenus, and bore the"
3629,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,last rites to the thankless ashes. First they build up a vast pyre of
3630,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"resinous billets and sawn oak, whose sides they entwine with dark leaves"
3631,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"and plant funereal cypresses in front, and adorn it above with his"
3632,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,shining armour. Some prepare warm water in cauldrons bubbling over the
3633,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"flames, and wash and anoint the chill body, and make their moan; then,"
3634,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"their weeping done, lay his limbs on the pillow, and spread over it"
3635,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"crimson raiment, the accustomed pall. Some uplift the heavy bier, a"
3636,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"melancholy service, and with averted faces in their ancestral fashion"
3637,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"hold and thrust in the torch. Gifts of frankincense, food, and bowls of"
3638,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"olive oil, are poured and piled upon the fire. After the embers sank in"
3639,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"and the flame died away, they soaked with wine the remnant of thirsty"
3640,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"ashes, and Corynaeus gathered the bones and shut them in an urn of"
3641,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"brass; and he too thrice encircled his comrades with fresh water, and"
3642,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,cleansed them with light spray sprinkled from a [231-267]bough of
3643,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"fruitful olive, and spoke the last words of all. But good Aeneas heaps a"
3644,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"mighty mounded tomb over him, with his own armour and his oar and"
3645,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"trumpet, beneath a skyey mountain that now is called Misenus after him,"
3646,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,and keeps his name immortal from age to age.
3647,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3648,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"This done, he hastens to fulfil the Sibyl's ordinance. A deep cave"
3649,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"yawned dreary and vast, shingle-strewn, sheltered by the black lake and"
3650,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,the gloom of the forests; over it no flying things could wing their way
3651,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"unharmed, such a vapour streamed from the dark gorge and rose into the"
3652,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,overarching sky. Here the priestess first arrays four black-bodied
3653,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,bullocks and pours wine upon their forehead; and plucking the topmost
3654,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"hairs from between the horns, lays them on the sacred fire for"
3655,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"first-offering, calling aloud on Hecate, mistress of heaven and hell."
3656,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Others lay knives beneath, and catch the warm blood in cups. Aeneas"
3657,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,himself smites with the sword a black-fleeced she-lamb to the mother of
3658,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"the Eumenides and her mighty sister, and a barren heifer, Proserpine, to"
3659,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"thee. Then he uprears darkling altars to the Stygian king, and lays"
3660,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"whole carcases of bulls upon the flames, pouring fat oil over the"
3661,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,blazing entrails. And lo! about the first rays of sunrise the ground
3662,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"moaned underfoot, and the woodland ridges began to stir, and dogs seemed"
3663,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"to howl through the dusk as the goddess came. 'Apart, ah keep apart, O"
3664,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,ye unsanctified!' cries the soothsayer; 'retire from all the grove; and
3665,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"thou, stride on and unsheath thy steel; now is need of courage, O"
3666,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Aeneas, now of strong resolve.' So much she spoke, and plunged madly"
3667,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,into the cavern's opening; he with unflinching steps keeps pace with his
3668,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,advancing guide.
3669,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3670,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Gods who are sovereign over souls! silent ghosts, and Chaos and"
3671,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Phlegethon, the wide dumb realm of night! as I have heard, so let me"
3672,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"tell, and according to your will unfold things sunken deep under earth"
3673,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,in gloom.
3674,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3675,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,[268-303]They went darkling through the dusk beneath the solitary
3676,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"night, through the empty dwellings and bodiless realm of Dis; even as"
3677,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"one walks in the forest beneath the jealous light of a doubtful moon,"
3678,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,when Jupiter shrouds the sky in shadow and black night blots out the
3679,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,world. Right in front of the doorway and in the entry of the jaws of
3680,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,hell Grief and avenging Cares have made their bed; there dwell wan
3681,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Sicknesses and gloomy Eld, and Fear, and ill-counselling Hunger, and"
3682,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"loathly Want, shapes terrible to see; and Death and Travail, and thereby"
3683,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Sleep, Death's kinsman, and the Soul's guilty Joys, and death-dealing"
3684,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"War full in the gateway, and the Furies in their iron cells, and mad"
3685,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,Discord with bloodstained fillets enwreathing her serpent locks.
3686,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3687,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Midway an elm, shadowy and high, spreads her boughs and secular arms,"
3688,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"where, one saith, idle Dreams dwell clustering, and cling under every"
3689,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"leaf. And monstrous creatures besides, many and diverse, keep covert at"
3690,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"the gates, Centaurs and twy-shaped Scyllas, and the hundredfold"
3691,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Briareus, and the beast of Lerna hissing horribly, and the Chimaera"
3692,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"armed with flame, Gorgons and Harpies, and the body of the triform"
3693,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"shade. Here Aeneas snatches at his sword in a sudden flutter of terror,"
3694,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,and turns the naked edge on them as they come; and did not his wise
3695,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,fellow-passenger remind him that these lives flit thin and unessential
3696,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"in the hollow mask of body, he would rush on and vainly lash through"
3697,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,phantoms with his steel.
3698,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3699,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,Hence a road leads to Tartarus and Acheron's wave. Here the dreary pool
3700,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,swirls thick in muddy eddies and disgorges into Cocytus with its load of
3701,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"sand. Charon, the dread ferryman, guards these flowing streams, ragged"
3702,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"and awful, his chin covered with untrimmed masses of hoary hair, and his"
3703,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,glassy eyes aflame; his soiled raiment hangs knotted from his shoulders.
3704,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Himself he plies the pole and trims the sails of his vessel, the"
3705,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"steel-blue galley with freight [304-336]of dead; stricken now in years,"
3706,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"but a god's old age is lusty and green. Hither all crowded, and rushed"
3707,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"streaming to the bank, matrons and men and high-hearted heroes dead and"
3708,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"done with life, boys and unwedded girls, and children laid young on the"
3709,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"bier before their parents' eyes, multitudinous as leaves fall dropping"
3710,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"in the forests at autumn's earliest frost, or birds swarm landward from"
3711,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"the deep gulf, when the chill of the year routs them overseas and drives"
3712,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"them to sunny lands. They stood pleading for the first passage across,"
3713,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,and stretched forth passionate hands to the farther shore. But the grim
3714,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"sailor admits now one and now another, while some he pushes back far"
3715,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"apart on the strand. Moved with marvel at the confused throng: 'Say, O"
3716,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"maiden,' cries Aeneas, 'what means this flocking to the river? of what"
3717,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,are the souls so fain? or what difference makes these retire from the
3718,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"banks, those go with sweeping oars over the leaden waterways?'"
3719,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3720,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,To him the long-lived priestess thus briefly returned: 'Seed of
3721,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Anchises, most sure progeny of gods, thou seest the deep pools of"
3722,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Cocytus and the Stygian marsh, by whose divinity the gods fear to swear"
3723,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,falsely. All this crowd thou discernest is helpless and unsepultured;
3724,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,Charon is the ferryman; they who ride on the wave found a tomb. Nor is
3725,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,it given to cross the awful banks and hoarse streams ere the dust hath
3726,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,found a resting-place. An hundred years they wander here flitting about
3727,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"the shore; then at last they gain entrance, and revisit the pools so"
3728,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,sorely desired.'
3729,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3730,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Anchises' son stood still, and ponderingly stayed his footsteps, pitying"
3731,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"at heart their cruel lot. There he discerns, mournful and unhonoured"
3732,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"dead, Leucaspis and Orontes, captains of the Lycian squadron, whom, as"
3733,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"they sailed together from Troy over gusty seas, the south wind"
3734,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,overwhelmed and wrapped the waters round ship and men.
3735,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3736,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"[337-369]Lo, there went by Palinurus the steersman, who of late, while"
3737,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"he watched the stars on their Libyan passage, had slipped from the stern"
3738,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"and fallen amid the waves. To him, when he first knew the melancholy"
3739,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"form in that depth of shade, he thus opens speech: 'What god, O"
3740,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Palinurus, reft thee from us and sank thee amid the seas? forth and"
3741,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"tell. For in this single answer Apollo deceived me, never found false"
3742,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"before, when he prophesied thee safety on ocean and arrival on the"
3743,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Ausonian coasts. See, is this his promise-keeping?'"
3744,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3745,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"And he: 'Neither did Phoebus on his oracular seat delude thee, O prince,"
3746,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Anchises' son, nor did any god drown me in the sea. For while I clung to"
3747,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"my appointed charge and governed our course, I pulled the tiller with me"
3748,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"in my fall, and the shock as I slipped wrenched it away. By the rough"
3749,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"seas I swear, fear for myself never wrung me so sore as for thy ship,"
3750,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"lest, the rudder lost and the pilot struck away, those gathering waves"
3751,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,might master it. Three wintry nights in the water the blustering south
3752,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,drove me over the endless sea; scarcely on the fourth dawn I descried
3753,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,Italy as I rose on the climbing wave. Little by little I swam shoreward;
3754,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"already I clung safe; but while, encumbered with my dripping raiment, I"
3755,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"caught with crooked fingers at the jagged needles of mountain rock, the"
3756,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,barbarous people attacked me in arms and ignorantly deemed me a prize.
3757,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Now the wave holds me, and the winds toss me on the shore. By heaven's"
3758,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"pleasant light and breezes I beseech thee, by thy father, by IÃ¼lus thy"
3759,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"rising hope, rescue me from these distresses, O unconquered one! Either"
3760,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"do thou, for thou canst, cast earth over me and again seek the haven of"
3761,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Velia; or do thou, if in any wise that may be, if in any wise the"
3762,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"goddess who bore thee shews a way,--for not without divine will do I"
3763,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,deem thou wilt float across these vast rivers and the Stygian
3764,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"pool,--lend me a pitying [370-403]hand, and bear me over the waves in"
3765,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"thy company, that at least in death I may find a quiet resting-place.'"
3766,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3767,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Thus he ended, and the soothsayer thus began: 'Whence, O Palinurus, this"
3768,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,fierce longing of thine? Shalt thou without burial behold the Stygian
3769,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,waters and the awful river of the Furies? Cease to hope prayers may bend
3770,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"the decrees of heaven. But take my words to thy memory, for comfort in"
3771,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,thy woeful case: far and wide shall the bordering cities be driven by
3772,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"celestial portents to appease thy dust; they shall rear a tomb, and pay"
3773,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"the tomb a yearly offering, and for evermore shall the place keep"
3774,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Palinurus' name.' The words soothed away his distress, and for a while"
3775,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,drove grief away from his sorrowing heart; he is glad in the land of his
3776,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,name.
3777,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3778,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"So they complete their journey's beginning, and draw nigh the river."
3779,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,Just then the waterman descried them from the Stygian wave advancing
3780,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"through the silent woodland and turning their feet towards the bank, and"
3781,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,opens on them in these words of challenge: 'Whoso thou art who marchest
3782,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"in arms towards our river, forth and say, there as thou art, why thou"
3783,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"comest, and stay thine advance. This is the land of Shadows, of Sleep,"
3784,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,and slumberous Night; no living body may the Stygian hull convey. Nor
3785,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"truly had I joy of taking Alcides on the lake for passenger, nor Theseus"
3786,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"and PirithoÃ¼s, born of gods though they were and unconquered in might."
3787,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"He laid fettering hand on the warder of Tartarus, and dragged him"
3788,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,cowering from the throne of my lord the King; they essayed to ravish our
3789,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,mistress from the bridal chamber of Dis.' Thereto the Amphrysian
3790,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,soothsayer made brief reply: 'No such plot is here; be not moved; nor do
3791,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,our weapons offer violence; the huge gatekeeper may bark on for ever in
3792,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,his cavern and affright the bloodless ghosts; Proserpine may keep her
3793,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"honour within her uncle's gates. Aeneas of Troy, renowned [404-437]in"
3794,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"goodness as in arms, goes down to meet his father in the deep shades of"
3795,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Erebus. If the sight of such affection stirs thee in nowise, yet this"
3796,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,bough' (she discovers the bough hidden in her raiment) 'thou must know.'
3797,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Then his heaving breast allays its anger, and he says no more; but"
3798,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"marvelling at the awful gift, the fated rod so long unseen, he steers in"
3799,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,his dusky vessel and draws to shore. Next he routs out the souls that
3800,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"sate on the long benches, and clears the thwarts, while he takes mighty"
3801,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Aeneas on board. The galley groaned under the weight in all her seams,"
3802,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,and the marsh-water leaked fast in. At length prophetess and prince are
3803,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,landed unscathed on the ugly ooze and livid sedge.
3804,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3805,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"This realm rings with the triple-throated baying of vast Cerberus,"
3806,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"couched huge in the cavern opposite; to whom the prophetess, seeing the"
3807,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"serpents already bristling up on his neck, throws a cake made slumberous"
3808,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"with honey and drugged grain. He, with threefold jaws gaping in ravenous"
3809,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"hunger, catches it when thrown, and sinks to earth with monstrous body"
3810,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"outstretched, and sprawling huge over all his den. The warder"
3811,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"overwhelmed, Aeneas makes entrance, and quickly issues from the bank of"
3812,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,the irremeable wave.
3813,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3814,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Immediately wailing voices are loud in their ears, the souls of babies"
3815,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"crying on the doorway sill, whom, torn from the breast and portionless"
3816,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"in life's sweetness, a dark day cut off and drowned in bitter death."
3817,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,Hard by them are those condemned to death on false accusation. Neither
3818,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,indeed are these dwellings assigned without lot and judgment; Minos
3819,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"presides and shakes the urn; he summons a council of the silent people,"
3820,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,and inquires of their lives and charges. Next in order have these
3821,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"mourners their place whose own innocent hands dealt them death, who"
3822,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,flung away their souls in hatred of the day. How fain were they now in
3823,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,upper air to endure their poverty and [438-472]sore travail! It may not
3824,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"be; the unlovely pool locks them in her gloomy wave, and Styx pours her"
3825,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,ninefold barrier between. And not far from here are shewn stretching on
3826,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,every side the Wailing Fields; so they call them by name. Here they whom
3827,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"pitiless love hath wasted in cruel decay hide among untrodden ways,"
3828,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,shrouded in embosoming myrtle thickets; not death itself ends their
3829,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,distresses. In this region he discerns Phaedra and Procris and woeful
3830,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Eriphyle, shewing on her the wounds of her merciless son, and Evadne and"
3831,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"PasiphaÃ«; Laodamia goes in their company, and she who was once Caeneus"
3832,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"and a man, now woman, and again returned by fate into her shape of old."
3833,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Among whom Dido the Phoenician, fresh from her death-wound, wandered in"
3834,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"the vast forest; by her the Trojan hero stood, and knew the dim form"
3835,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"through the darkness, even as the moon at the month's beginning to him"
3836,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,who sees or thinks he sees her rising through the vapours; he let tears
3837,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"fall, and spoke to her lovingly and sweet:"
3838,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3839,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"'Alas, Dido! so the news was true that reached me; thou didst perish,"
3840,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"and the sword sealed thy doom! Ah me, was I cause of thy death? By the"
3841,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"stars I swear, by the heavenly powers and all that is sacred beneath the"
3842,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"earth, unwillingly, O queen, I left thy shore. But the gods, at whose"
3843,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"orders now I pass through this shadowy place, this land of mouldering"
3844,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"overgrowth and deep night, the gods' commands drove me forth; nor could"
3845,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,I deem my departure would bring thee pain so great as this. Stay thy
3846,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"footstep, and withdraw not from our gaze. From whom fliest thou? the"
3847,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,last speech of thee fate ordains me is this.'
3848,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3849,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,In such words and with starting tears Aeneas soothed the burning and
3850,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"fierce-eyed soul. She turned away with looks fixed fast on the ground,"
3851,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,stirred no more in countenance by the speech he essays than if she stood
3852,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"in iron flint or Marpesian stone. At length she started, and fled"
3853,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"wrathfully [473-508]into the shadowy woodland, where Sychaeus, her"
3854,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"ancient husband, responds to her distresses and equals her affection."
3855,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Yet Aeneas, dismayed by her cruel doom, follows her far on her way with"
3856,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,pitying tears.
3857,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3858,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,Thence he pursues his appointed path. And now they trod those utmost
3859,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,fields where the renowned in war have their haunt apart. Here Tydeus
3860,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"meets him; here Parthenopaeus, glorious in arms, and the pallid phantom"
3861,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,of Adrastus; here the Dardanians long wept on earth and fallen in the
3862,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"war; sighing he discerns all their long array, Glaucus and Medon and"
3863,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Thersilochus, the three children of Antenor, and Polyphoetes, Ceres'"
3864,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"priest, and Idaeus yet charioted, yet grasping his arms. The souls"
3865,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,throng round him to right and left; nor is one look enough; lingering
3866,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"delighted, they pace by his side and enquire wherefore he is come. But"
3867,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"the princes of the Grecians and Agamemnon's armies, when they see him"
3868,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"glittering in arms through the gloom, hurry terror-stricken away; some"
3869,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"turn backward, as when of old they fled to the ships; some raise their"
3870,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"voice faintly, and gasp out a broken ineffectual cry."
3871,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3872,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"And here he saw DeÃ¯phobus son of Priam, with face cruelly torn, face and"
3873,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"both hands, and ears lopped from his mangled temples, and nostrils"
3874,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,maimed by a shameful wound. Barely he knew the cowering form that hid
3875,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,its dreadful punishment; then he springs to accost it in familiar
3876,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,speech:
3877,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3878,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"'DeÃ¯phobus mighty in arms, seed of Teucer's royal blood, whose"
3879,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,wantonness of vengeance was so cruel? who was allowed to use thee thus?
3880,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Rumour reached me that on that last night, outwearied with endless"
3881,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"slaughter, thou hadst sunk on the heap of mingled carnage. Then mine own"
3882,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"hand reared an empty tomb on the Rhoetean shore, mine own voice thrice"
3883,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"called aloud upon thy ghost. Thy name and armour keep the spot; thee, O"
3884,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"my friend, I could not see nor lay in the native earth I left.'"
3885,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3886,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"[509-541]Whereto the son of Priam: 'In nothing, O my friend, wert thou"
3887,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,wanting; thou hast paid the full to DeÃ¯phobus and the dead man's shade.
3888,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,But me my fate and the Laconian woman's murderous guilt thus dragged
3889,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,down to doom; these are the records of her leaving. For how we spent
3890,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"that last night in delusive gladness thou knowest, and must needs"
3891,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,remember too well. When the fated horse leapt down on the steep towers
3892,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"of Troy, bearing armed infantry for the burden of its womb, she, in"
3893,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"feigned procession, led round our Phrygian women with Bacchic cries;"
3894,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"herself she upreared a mighty flame amid them, and called the Grecians"
3895,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,out of the fortress height. Then was I fast in mine ill-fated bridal
3896,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"chamber, deep asleep and outworn with my charge, and lay overwhelmed in"
3897,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,slumber sweet and profound and most like to easeful death. Meanwhile
3898,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"that crown of wives removes all the arms from my dwelling, and slips out"
3899,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,the faithful sword from beneath my head: she calls Menelaus into the
3900,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,house and flings wide the gateway: be sure she hoped her lover would
3901,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"magnify the gift, and so she might quench the fame of her ill deeds of"
3902,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"old. Why do I linger? They burst into the chamber, they and the Aeolid,"
3903,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"counsellor of crime, in their company. Gods, recompense the Greeks even"
3904,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"thus, if with righteous lips I call for vengeance! But come, tell in"
3905,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,turn what hap hath brought thee hither yet alive. Comest thou driven on
3906,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"ocean wanderings, or by promptings from heaven? or what fortune keeps"
3907,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"thee from rest, that thou shouldst draw nigh these sad sunless"
3908,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"dwellings, this disordered land?'"
3909,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3910,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,In this change of talk Dawn had already crossed heaven's mid axle on her
3911,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,rose-charioted way; and haply had they thus drawn out all the allotted
3912,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,time; but the Sibyl made brief warning speech to her companion: 'Night
3913,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"falls, Aeneas; we waste the hours in weeping. Here is the place where"
3914,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,the road disparts; by this that runs to the right [542-574]under great
3915,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,Dis' city is our path to Elysium; but the leftward wreaks vengeance on
3916,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,the wicked and sends them to unrelenting hell.' But DeÃ¯phobus: 'Be not
3917,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"angered, mighty priestess; I will depart, I will refill my place and"
3918,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"return into darkness. Go, glory of our people, go, enjoy a fairer fate"
3919,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"than mine.' Thus much he spoke, and on the word turned away his"
3920,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,footsteps.
3921,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3922,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Aeneas looks swiftly back, and sees beneath the cliff on the left hand a"
3923,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"wide city, girt with a triple wall and encircled by a racing river of"
3924,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"boiling flame, Tartarean Phlegethon, that echoes over its rolling rocks."
3925,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"In front is the gate, huge and pillared with solid adamant, that no"
3926,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,warring force of men nor the very habitants of heaven may avail to
3927,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"overthrow; it stands up a tower of iron, and Tisiphone sitting girt in"
3928,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,bloodstained pall keeps sleepless watch at the entry by night and day.
3929,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Hence moans are heard and fierce lashes resound, with the clank of iron"
3930,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,and dragging chains. Aeneas stopped and hung dismayed at the tumult.
3931,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"'What shapes of crime are here? declare, O maiden; or what the"
3932,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"punishment that pursues them, and all this upsurging wail?' Then the"
3933,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"soothsayer thus began to speak: 'Illustrious chief of Troy, no pure foot"
3934,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"may tread these guilty courts; but to me Hecate herself, when she gave"
3935,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"me rule over the groves of Avernus, taught how the gods punish, and"
3936,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,guided me through all her realm. Gnosian Rhadamanthus here holds
3937,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"unrelaxing sway, chastises secret crime revealed, and exacts confession,"
3938,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,wheresoever in the upper world one vainly exultant in stolen guilt hath
3939,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,till the dusk of death kept clear from the evil he wrought. Straightway
3940,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"avenging Tisiphone, girt with her scourge, tramples down the shivering"
3941,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"sinners, menaces them with the grim snakes in her left hand, and summons"
3942,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,forth her sisters in merciless train. Then at last the sacred gates are
3943,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,flung open and grate on the jarring hinge. Markest thou what sentry is
3944,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,seated in [575-609]the doorway? what shape guards the threshold? More
3945,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,grim within sits the monstrous Hydra with her fifty black yawning
3946,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,throats: and Tartarus' self gapes sheer and strikes into the gloom
3947,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,through twice the space that one looks upward to Olympus and the skyey
3948,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"heaven. Here Earth's ancient children, the Titans' brood, hurled down by"
3949,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"the thunderbolt, lie wallowing in the abyss. Here likewise I saw the"
3950,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"twin AloÃ¯ds, enormous of frame, who essayed with violent hands to pluck"
3951,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,down high heaven and thrust Jove from his upper realm. Likewise I saw
3952,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,Salmoneus in the cruel payment he gives for mocking Jove's flame and
3953,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Olympus' thunders. Borne by four horses and brandishing a torch, he rode"
3954,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"in triumph midway through the populous city of Grecian Elis, and claimed"
3955,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,for himself the worship of deity; madman! who would mimic the
3956,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,storm-cloud and the inimitable bolt with brass that rang under his
3957,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,trampling horse-hoofs. But the Lord omnipotent hurled his shaft through
3958,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,thickening clouds (no firebrand his nor smoky glare of torches) and
3959,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,dashed him headlong in the fury of the whirlwind. Therewithal Tityos
3960,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"might be seen, fosterling of Earth the mother of all, whose body"
3961,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"stretches over nine full acres, and a monstrous vulture with crooked"
3962,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,beak eats away the imperishable liver and the entrails that breed in
3963,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"suffering, and plunges deep into the breast that gives it food and"
3964,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,dwelling; nor is any rest given to the fibres that ever grow anew. Why
3965,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"tell of the Lapithae, of Ixion and PirithoÃ¼s? over whom a stone hangs"
3966,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,just slipping and just as though it fell; or the high banqueting couches
3967,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"gleam golden-pillared, and the feast is spread in royal luxury before"
3968,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"their faces; couched hard by, the eldest of the Furies wards the tables"
3969,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,from their touch and rises with torch upreared and thunderous lips. Here
3970,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"are they who hated their brethren while life endured, or struck a parent"
3971,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"or entangled a client in wrong, or who brooded [610-643]alone over"
3972,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"found treasure and shared it not with their fellows, this the greatest"
3973,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"multitude of all; and they who were slain for adultery, and who followed"
3974,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"unrighteous arms, and feared not to betray their masters' plighted hand."
3975,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Imprisoned they await their doom. Seek not to be told that doom, that"
3976,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"fashion of fortune wherein they are sunk. Some roll a vast stone, or"
3977,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,hang outstretched on the spokes of wheels; hapless Theseus sits and
3978,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"shall sit for ever, and Phlegyas in his misery gives counsel to all and"
3979,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"witnesses aloud through the gloom, _Learn by this warning to do justly"
3980,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"and not to slight the gods._ This man sold his country for gold, and"
3981,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,laid her under a tyrant's sway; he set up and pulled down laws at a
3982,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,price; this other forced his daughter's bridal chamber and a forbidden
3983,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"marriage; all dared some monstrous wickedness, and had success in what"
3984,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"they dared. Not had I an hundred tongues, an hundred mouths, and a voice"
3985,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"of iron, could I sum up all the shapes of crime or name over all their"
3986,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,punishments.'
3987,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3988,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Thus spoke Phoebus' long-lived priestess; then 'But come now,' she"
3989,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,cries; 'haste on the way and perfect the service begun; let us go
3990,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"faster; I descry the ramparts cast in Cyclopean furnaces, and in front"
3991,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,the arched gateway where they bid us lay the gifts foreordained.' She
3992,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"ended, and advancing side by side along the shadowy ways, they pass over"
3993,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"and draw nigh the gates. Aeneas makes entrance, and sprinkling his body"
3994,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"with fresh water, plants the bough full in the gateway."
3995,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
3996,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Now at length, this fully done, and the service of the goddess"
3997,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"perfected, they came to the happy place, the green pleasances and"
3998,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,blissful seats of the Fortunate Woodlands. Here an ampler air clothes
3999,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"the meadows in lustrous sheen, and they know their own sun and a"
4000,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,starlight of their own. Some exercise their limbs in tournament on the
4001,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"greensward, contend in games, and wrestle on the yellow sand. Some"
4002,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,[644-676]dance with beating footfall and lips that sing; with them is
4003,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"the Thracian priest in sweeping robe, and makes music to their measures"
4004,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"with the notes' sevenfold interval, the notes struck now with his"
4005,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"fingers, now with his ivory rod. Here is Teucer's ancient brood, a"
4006,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"generation excellent in beauty, high-hearted heroes born in happier"
4007,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"years, Ilus and Assaracus, and Dardanus, founder of Troy. Afar he"
4008,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,marvels at the armour and chariots empty of their lords: their spears
4009,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"stand fixed in the ground, and their unyoked horses pasture at large"
4010,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"over the plain: their life's delight in chariot and armour, their care"
4011,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"in pasturing their sleek horses, follows them in like wise low under"
4012,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"earth. Others, lo! he beholds feasting on the sward to right and left,"
4013,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"and singing in chorus the glad Paean-cry, within a scented laurel-grove"
4014,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,whence Eridanus river surges upward full-volumed through the wood. Here
4015,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"is the band of them who bore wounds in fighting for their country, and"
4016,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"they who were pure in priesthood while life endured, and the good poets"
4017,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,whose speech abased not Apollo; and they who made life beautiful by the
4018,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"arts of their invention, and who won by service a memory among men, the"
4019,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,brows of all girt with the snow-white fillet. To their encircling throng
4020,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"the Sibyl spoke thus, and to Musaeus before them all; for he is midmost"
4021,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"of all the multitude, and stands out head and shoulders among their"
4022,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,upward gaze:
4023,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
4024,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"'Tell, O blissful souls, and thou, poet most gracious, what region, what"
4025,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"place hath Anchises for his own? For his sake are we come, and have"
4026,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,sailed across the wide rivers of Erebus.'
4027,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
4028,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,And to her the hero thus made brief reply: 'None hath a fixed dwelling;
4029,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,we live in the shady woodlands; soft-swelling banks and meadows fresh
4030,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"with streams are our habitation. But you, if this be your heart's"
4031,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"desire, scale this ridge, and I will even now set you on an easy"
4032,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"[677-708]pathway.' He spoke, and paced on before them, and from above"
4033,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,shews the shining plains; thereafter they leave the mountain heights.
4034,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
4035,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"But lord Anchises, deep in the green valley, was musing in earnest"
4036,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"survey over the imprisoned souls destined to the daylight above, and"
4037,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"haply reviewing his beloved children and all the tale of his people,"
4038,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"them and their fates and fortunes, their works and ways. And he, when he"
4039,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"saw Aeneas advancing to meet him over the greensward, stretched forth"
4040,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"both hands eagerly, while tears rolled over his cheeks, and his lips"
4041,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"parted in a cry: 'Art thou come at last, and hath thy love, O child of"
4042,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"my desire, conquered the difficult road? Is it granted, O my son, to"
4043,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,gaze on thy face and hear and answer in familiar tones? Thus indeed I
4044,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"forecast in spirit, counting the days between; nor hath my care misled"
4045,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"me. What lands, what space of seas hast thou traversed to reach me,"
4046,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"through what surge of perils, O my son! How I dreaded the realm of Libya"
4047,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,might work thee harm!'
4048,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
4049,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"And he: 'Thy melancholy phantom, thine, O my father, came before me"
4050,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"often and often, and drove me to steer to these portals. My fleet is"
4051,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"anchored on the Tyrrhenian brine. Give thine hand to clasp, O my father,"
4052,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"give it, and withdraw not from our embrace.'"
4053,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
4054,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"So spoke he, his face wet with abundant weeping. Thrice there did he"
4055,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,essay to fling his arms about his neck; thrice the phantom vainly
4056,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"grasped fled out of his hands even as light wind, and most like to"
4057,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,fluttering sleep.
4058,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
4059,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,Meanwhile Aeneas sees deep withdrawn in the covert of the vale a
4060,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"woodland and rustling forest thickets, and the river of Lethe that"
4061,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,floats past their peaceful dwellings. Around it flitted nations and
4062,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,peoples innumerable; even as in the meadows when in clear summer weather
4063,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,bees settle on the variegated flowers and stream round the snow-white
4064,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"[709-742]lilies, all the plain is murmurous with their humming. Aeneas"
4065,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"starts at the sudden view, and asks the reason he knows not; what are"
4066,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"those spreading streams, or who are they whose vast train fills the"
4067,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"banks? Then lord Anchises: 'Souls, for whom second bodies are destined"
4068,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"and due, drink at the wave of the Lethean stream the heedless water of"
4069,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,long forgetfulness. These of a truth have I long desired to tell and
4070,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"shew thee face to face, and number all the generation of thy children,"
4071,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,that so thou mayest the more rejoice with me in finding Italy.'--'O
4072,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"father, must we think that any souls travel hence into upper air, and"
4073,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,return again to bodily fetters? why this their strange sad longing for
4074,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"the light?' 'I will tell,' rejoins Anchises, 'nor will I hold thee in"
4075,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"suspense, my son.' And he unfolds all things in order one by one."
4076,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
4077,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"'First of all, heaven and earth and the liquid fields, the shining orb"
4078,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"of the moon and the Titanian star, doth a spirit sustain inly, and a"
4079,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,soul shed abroad in them sways all their members and mingles in the
4080,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"mighty frame. Thence is the generation of man and beast, the life of"
4081,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"winged things, and the monstrous forms that ocean breeds under his"
4082,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"glittering floor. Those seeds have fiery force and divine birth, so far"
4083,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,as they are not clogged by taint of the body and dulled by earthy frames
4084,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"and limbs ready to die. Hence is it they fear and desire, sorrow and"
4085,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,rejoice; nor can they pierce the air while barred in the blind darkness
4086,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"of their prison-house. Nay, and when the last ray of life is gone, not"
4087,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"yet, alas! does all their woe, nor do all the plagues of the body wholly"
4088,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,leave them free; and needs must be that many a long ingrained evil
4089,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,should take root marvellously deep. Therefore they are schooled in
4090,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"punishment, and pay all the forfeit of a lifelong ill; some are hung"
4091,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,stretched to the viewless winds; some have the taint of guilt washed out
4092,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"beneath the dreary deep, or burned away in fire. We [743-777]suffer,"
4093,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,each a several ghost; thereafter we are sent to the broad spaces of
4094,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Elysium, some few of us to possess the happy fields; till length of days"
4095,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,completing time's circle takes out the ingrained soilure and leaves
4096,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,untainted the ethereal sense and pure spiritual flame. All these before
4097,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"thee, when the wheel of a thousand years hath come fully round, a God"
4098,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"summons in vast train to the river of Lethe, that so they may regain in"
4099,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"forgetfulness the slopes of upper earth, and begin to desire to return"
4100,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,again into the body.'
4101,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
4102,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Anchises ceased, and leads his son and the Sibyl likewise amid the"
4103,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"assembled murmurous throng, and mounts a hillock whence he might scan"
4104,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,all the long ranks and learn their countenances as they came.
4105,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
4106,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"'Now come, the glory hereafter to follow our Dardanian progeny, the"
4107,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"posterity to abide in our Italian people, illustrious souls and"
4108,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"inheritors of our name to be, these will I rehearse, and instruct thee"
4109,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"of thy destinies. He yonder, seest thou? the warrior leaning on his"
4110,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"pointless spear, holds the nearest place allotted in our groves, and"
4111,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,shall rise first into the air of heaven from the mingling blood of
4112,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Italy, Silvius of Alban name, the child of thine age, whom late in thy"
4113,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"length of days thy wife Lavinia shall nurture in the woodland, king and"
4114,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,father of kings; from him in Alba the Long shall our house have
4115,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"dominion. He next him is Procas, glory of the Trojan race; and Capys and"
4116,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Numitor; and he who shall renew thy name, Silvius Aeneas, eminent alike"
4117,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"in goodness or in arms, if ever he shall receive his kingdom in Alba."
4118,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Men of men! see what strength they display, and wear the civic oak"
4119,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,shading their brows. They shall establish Nomentum and Gabii and Fidena
4120,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"city, they the Collatine hill-fortress, Pometii and the Fort of Inuus,"
4121,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Bola and Cora: these shall be names that are now nameless lands. Nay,"
4122,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Romulus likewise, seed of Mavors, shall join [778-810]his grandsire's"
4123,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"company, from his mother Ilia's nurture and Assaracus' blood. Seest thou"
4124,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"how the twin plumes straighten on his crest, and his father's own"
4125,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"emblazonment already marks him for upper air? Behold, O son! by his"
4126,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,augury shall Rome the renowned fill earth with her empire and heaven
4127,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"with her pride, and gird about seven fortresses with her single wall,"
4128,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,prosperous mother of men; even as our lady of Berecyntus rides in her
4129,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"chariot turret-crowned through the Phrygian cities, glad in the gods she"
4130,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"hath borne, clasping an hundred of her children's children, all"
4131,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"habitants of heaven, all dwellers on the upper heights. Hither now bend"
4132,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"thy twin-eyed gaze; behold this people, the Romans that are thine. Here"
4133,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,is Caesar and all IÃ¼lus' posterity that shall arise under the mighty
4134,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"cope of heaven. Here is he, he of whose promise once and again thou"
4135,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"hearest, Caesar Augustus, a god's son, who shall again establish the"
4136,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"ages of gold in Latium over the fields that once were Saturn's realm,"
4137,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"and carry his empire afar to Garamant and Indian, to the land that lies"
4138,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"beyond our stars, beyond the sun's yearlong ways, where Atlas the"
4139,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,sky-bearer wheels on his shoulder the glittering star-spangled pole.
4140,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,Before his coming even now the kingdoms of the Caspian shudder at
4141,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"oracular answers, and the Maeotic land and the mouths of sevenfold Nile"
4142,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"flutter in alarm. Nor indeed did Alcides traverse such spaces of earth,"
4143,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"though he pierced the brazen-footed deer, or though he stilled the"
4144,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,Erymanthian woodlands and made Lerna tremble at his bow: nor he who
4145,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"sways his team with reins of vine, Liber the conqueror, when he drives"
4146,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,his tigers from Nysa's lofty crest. And do we yet hesitate to give
4147,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"valour scope in deeds, or shrink in fear from setting foot on Ausonian"
4148,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"land? Ah, and who is he apart, marked out with sprays of olive, offering"
4149,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,sacrifice? I know the locks and hoary chin of the king of Rome who shall
4150,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"establish the infant city in his [811-843]laws, sent from little Cures'"
4151,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"sterile land to the majesty of empire. To him Tullus shall next succeed,"
4152,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,who shall break the peace of his country and stir to arms men rusted
4153,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,from war and armies now disused to triumphs; and hard on him
4154,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"over-vaunting Ancus follows, even now too elate in popular breath. Wilt"
4155,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"thou see also the Tarquin kings, and the haughty soul of Brutus the"
4156,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Avenger, and the fasces regained? He shall first receive a consul's"
4157,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"power and the merciless axes, and when his children would stir fresh"
4158,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"war, the father, for fair freedom's sake, shall summon them to doom."
4159,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Unhappy! yet howsoever posterity shall take the deed, love of country"
4160,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"and limitless passion for honour shall prevail. Nay, behold apart the"
4161,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Decii and the Drusi, Torquatus with his cruel axe, and Camillus"
4162,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"returning with the standards. Yonder souls likewise, whom thou"
4163,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"discernest gleaming in equal arms, at one now, while shut in Night, ah"
4164,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"me! what mutual war, what battle-lines and bloodshed shall they arouse,"
4165,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,so they attain the light of the living! father-in-law descending from
4166,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"the Alpine barriers and the fortress of the Dweller Alone, son-in-law"
4167,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"facing him with the embattled East. Nay, O my children, harden not your"
4168,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"hearts to such warfare, neither turn upon her own heart the mastering"
4169,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"might of your country; and thou, be thou first to forgive, who drawest"
4170,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"thy descent from heaven; cast down the weapons from thy hand, O blood of"
4171,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,mine. . . . He shall drive his conquering chariot to the Capitoline
4172,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"height triumphant over Corinth, glorious in Achaean slaughter. He shall"
4173,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"uproot Argos and Agamemnonian Mycenae, and the Aeacid's own heir, the"
4174,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"seed of Achilles mighty in arms, avenging his ancestors in Troy and"
4175,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Minerva's polluted temple. Who might leave thee, lordly Cato, or thee,"
4176,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Cossus, to silence? who the Gracchan family, or these two sons of the"
4177,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Scipios, a double thunderbolt of war, Libya's bale? and Fabricius potent"
4178,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"in poverty, or [844-875]thee, Serranus, sowing in the furrow? Whither"
4179,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"whirl you me all breathless, O Fabii? thou art he, the most mighty, the"
4180,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,one man whose lingering retrieves our State. Others shall beat out the
4181,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"breathing bronze to softer lines, I believe it well; shall draw living"
4182,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,lineaments from the marble; the cause shall be more eloquent on their
4183,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"lips; their pencil shall portray the pathways of heaven, and tell the"
4184,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"stars in their arising: be thy charge, O Roman, to rule the nations in"
4185,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"thine empire; this shall be thine art, to lay down the law of peace, to"
4186,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,be merciful to the conquered and beat the haughty down.'
4187,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
4188,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Thus lord Anchises, and as they marvel, he so pursues: 'Look how"
4189,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Marcellus the conqueror marches glorious in the splendid spoils,"
4190,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"towering high above them all! He shall stay the Roman State, reeling"
4191,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"beneath the invading shock, shall ride down Carthaginian and insurgent"
4192,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Gaul, and a third time hang up the captured armour before lord"
4193,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,Quirinus.'
4194,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
4195,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"And at this Aeneas, for he saw going by his side one excellent in beauty"
4196,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"and glittering in arms, but his brow had little cheer, and his eyes"
4197,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,looked down:
4198,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
4199,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"'Who, O my father, is he who thus attends him on his way? son, or other"
4200,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,of his children's princely race? How his comrades murmur around him! how
4201,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,goodly of presence he is! but dark Night flutters round his head with
4202,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,melancholy shade.'
4203,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
4204,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Then lord Anchises with welling tears began: 'O my son, ask not of the"
4205,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"great sorrow of thy people. Him shall fate but shew to earth, and suffer"
4206,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"not to stay further. Too mighty, lords of heaven, did you deem the brood"
4207,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"of Rome, had this your gift been abiding. What moaning of men shall"
4208,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,arise from the Field of Mavors by the imperial city! what a funeral
4209,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"train shalt thou see, O Tiber, as thou flowest by the new-made grave!"
4210,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,Neither shall the boyhood of any [876-901]of Ilian race raise his Latin
4211,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,forefathers' hope so high; nor shall the land of Romulus ever boast of
4212,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"any fosterling like this. Alas his goodness, alas his antique honour,"
4213,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,and right hand invincible in war! none had faced him unscathed in armed
4214,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"shock, whether he met the foe on foot, or ran his spurs into the flanks"
4215,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"of his foaming horse. Ah me, the pity of thee, O boy! if in any wise"
4216,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"thou breakest the grim bar of fate, thou shalt be Marcellus. Give me"
4217,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"lilies in full hands; let me strew bright blossoms, and these gifts at"
4218,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"least let me lavish on my descendant's soul, and do the unavailing"
4219,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,service.'
4220,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
4221,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,Thus they wander up and down over the whole region of broad vaporous
4222,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"plains, and scan all the scene. And when Anchises had led his son over"
4223,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"it, each point by each, and kindled his spirit with passion for the"
4224,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"glories on their way, he tells him thereafter of the war he next must"
4225,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"wage, and instructs him of the Laurentine peoples and the city of"
4226,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"Latinus, and in what wise each task may be turned aside or borne."
4227,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,
4228,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"There are twin portals of Sleep, whereof the one is fabled of horn, and"
4229,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,by it real shadows are given easy outlet; the other shining white of
4230,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"polished ivory, but false visions issue upward from the ghostly world."
4231,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,With these words then Anchises follows forth his son and the Sibyl
4232,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,"together there, and dismisses them by the ivory gate. He pursues his way"
4233,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,to the ships and revisits his comrades; then bears on to Caieta's haven
4234,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,straight along the shore. The anchor is cast from the prow; the sterns
4235,THE VISION OF THE UNDER WORLD,are grounded on the beach.

4287,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","of Laurentum. Faunus' father was Picus; and he boasts himself, Saturn,"
4288,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","thy son; thou art the first source of their blood. Son of his, by divine"
4289,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","ordinance, and male descent was none, cut off in the early spring of"
4290,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","youth. One alone kept the household and its august home, a daughter now"
4291,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",ripe for a husband and of full years for marriage. Many wooed her from
4292,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",wide Latium and all Ausonia. Fairest and foremost of all [56-93]is
4293,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","Turnus, of long and lordly ancestry; but boding signs from heaven, many"
4294,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","and terrible, bar the way. Within the palace, in the lofty inner courts,"
4295,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","was a laurel of sacred foliage, guarded in awe through many years, which"
4296,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","lord Latinus, it was said, himself found and dedicated to Phoebus when"
4297,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",first he would build his citadel; and from it gave his settlers their
4298,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","name, Laurentines. High atop of it, wonderful to tell, bees borne with"
4299,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","loud humming across the liquid air girt it thickly about, and with"
4300,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",interlinked feet hung in a sudden swarm from the leafy bough.
4301,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","Straightway the prophet cries: 'I see a foreigner draw nigh, an army"
4302,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","from the same quarter seek the same quarter, and reign high in our"
4303,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","fortress.' Furthermore, while maiden Lavinia stands beside her father"
4304,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","feeding the altars with holy fuel, she was seen, oh, horror! to catch"
4305,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","fire in her long tresses, and burn with flickering flame in all her"
4306,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","array, her queenly hair lit up, lit up her jewelled circlet; till,"
4307,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","enwreathed in smoke and lurid light, she scattered fire over all the"
4308,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","palace. That sight was rumoured wonderful and terrible. Herself, they"
4309,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","prophesied, she should be glorious in fame and fortune; but a great war"
4310,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","was foreshadowed for her people. But the King, troubled by the omen,"
4311,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","visits the oracle of his father Faunus the soothsayer, and the groves"
4312,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","deep under Albunea, where, queen of the woods, she echoes from her holy"
4313,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","well, and breathes forth a dim and deadly vapour. Hence do the tribes of"
4314,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",Italy and all the Oenotrian land seek answers in perplexity; hither the
4315,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","priest bears his gifts, and when he hath lain down and sought slumber"
4316,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","under the silent night on the spread fleeces of slaughtered sheep, sees"
4317,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","many flitting phantoms of wonderful wise, hears manifold voices, and"
4318,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","attains converse of the gods, and hath speech with Acheron and the deep"
4319,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","tract of hell. Here then, likewise seeking an answer, lord Latinus paid"
4320,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","fit sacrifice of an hundred woolly ewes, and [94-127]lay couched on the"
4321,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",strewn fleeces they had worn. Out of the lofty grove a sudden voice was
4322,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","uttered: 'Seek not, O my child, to unite thy daughter in Latin"
4323,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","espousals, nor trust her to the bridal chambers ready to thine hand;"
4324,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","foreigners shall come to be thy sons, whose blood shall raise our name"
4325,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","to heaven, and the children of whose race shall see, where the circling"
4326,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","sun looks on either ocean, all the rolling world swayed beneath their"
4327,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",feet.' This his father Faunus' answer and counsel given in the silent
4328,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",night Latinus restrains not in his lips; but wide-flitting Rumour had
4329,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","already borne it round among the Ausonian cities, when the children of"
4330,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",Laomedon moored their fleet to the grassy slope of the river bank.
4331,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",
4332,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","Aeneas, with the foremost of his captains and fair IÃ¼lus, lay them down"
4333,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",under the boughs of a high tree and array the feast. They spread wheaten
4334,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",cakes along the sward under their meats--so Jove on high prompted--and
4335,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",crown the platter of corn with wilding fruits. Here haply when the rest
4336,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","was spent, and scantness of food set them to eat their thin bread, and"
4337,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",with hand and venturous teeth do violence to the round cakes fraught
4338,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",with fate and spare not the flattened squares: _Ha! Are we eating our
4339,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","tables too?_ cries IÃ¼lus jesting, and stops. At once that accent heard"
4340,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",set their toils a limit; and at once as he spoke his father caught it
4341,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","from his lips and hushed him, in amazement at the omen. Straightway"
4342,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","'Hail, O land!' he cries, 'my destined inheritance! and hail, O"
4343,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","household gods, faithful to your Troy! here is home; this is our native"
4344,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","country. For my father Anchises, now I remember it, bequeathed me this"
4345,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","secret of fate: ""When hunger shall drive thee, O son, to consume thy"
4346,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","tables where the feast fails, on the unknown shores whither thou shalt"
4347,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","sail; then, though outwearied, hope for home, and there at last let"
4348,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","thine hand remember to set thy house's foundations and bulwarks."" This"
4349,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","was [128-162]the hunger, this the last that awaited us, to set the"
4350,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","promised end to our desolations . . . Up then, and, glad with the first"
4351,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","sunbeam, let us explore and search all abroad from our harbour, what is"
4352,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","the country, who its habitants, where is the town of the nation. Now"
4353,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","pour your cups to Jove, and call in prayer on Anchises our father,"
4354,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","setting the wine again upon the board.' So speaks he, and binding his"
4355,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","brows with a leafy bough, he makes supplication to the Genius of the"
4356,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","ground, and Earth first of deities, and the Nymphs, and the Rivers yet"
4357,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","unknown; then calls on Night and Night's rising signs, and next on Jove"
4358,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","of Ida, and our lady of Phrygia, and on his twain parents, in heaven and"
4359,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",in the under world. At this the Lord omnipotent thrice thundered sharp
4360,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","from high heaven, and with his own hand shook out for a sign in the sky"
4361,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",a cloud ablaze with luminous shafts of gold. A sudden rumour spreads
4362,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","among the Trojan array, that the day is come to found their destined"
4363,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","city. Emulously they renew the feast, and, glad at the high omen, array"
4364,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",the flagons and engarland the wine.
4365,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",
4366,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","Soon as the morrow bathed the lands in its dawning light, they part to"
4367,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","search out the town, and the borders and shores of the nation: these are"
4368,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",the pools and spring of Numicus; this is the Tiber river; here dwell the
4369,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",brave Latins. Then the seed of Anchises commands an hundred envoys
4370,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","chosen of every degree to go to the stately royal city, all with the"
4371,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","wreathed boughs of Pallas, to bear him gifts and desire grace for the"
4372,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","Teucrians. Without delay they hasten on their message, and advance with"
4373,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","swift step. Himself he traces the city walls with a shallow trench, and"
4374,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",builds on it; and in fashion of a camp girdles this first settlement on
4375,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",the shore with mound and battlements. And now his men had traversed
4376,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","their way; they espied the towers and steep roofs of the Latins, and"
4377,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",drew near the wall. Before the city boys and men in their early
4378,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","[163-196]bloom exercise on horseback, and break in their teams on the"
4379,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","dusty ground, or draw ringing bows, or hurl tough javelins from the"
4380,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","shoulder, and contend in running and boxing: when a messenger riding"
4381,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",forward brings news to the ears of the aged King that mighty men are
4382,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",come thither in unknown raiment. He gives orders to call them within his
4383,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","house, and takes his seat in the midst on his ancestral throne. His"
4384,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","house, stately and vast, crowned the city, upreared on an hundred"
4385,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","columns, once the palace of Laurentian Picus, amid awful groves of"
4386,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","ancestral sanctity. Here their kings receive the inaugural sceptre, and"
4387,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",have the fasces first raised before them; this temple was their
4388,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","senate-house; this their sacred banqueting-hall; here, after sacrifice"
4389,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","of rams, the elders were wont to sit down at long tables. Further, there"
4390,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",stood arow in the entry images of the forefathers of old in ancient
4391,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","cedar, Italus, and lord Sabinus, planter of the vine, still holding in"
4392,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","show the curved pruning-hook, and gray Saturn, and the likeness of Janus"
4393,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","the double-facing, and the rest of their primal kings, and they who had"
4394,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",borne wounds of war in fighting for their country. Armour besides hangs
4395,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","thickly on the sacred doors, captured chariots and curved axes,"
4396,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","helmet-crests and massy gateway-bars, lances and shields, and beaks torn"
4397,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","from warships. He too sat there, with the divining-rod of Quirinus, girt"
4398,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","in the short augural gown, and carrying on his left arm the sacred"
4399,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","shield, Picus the tamer of horses; he whom Circe, desperate with amorous"
4400,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","desire, smote with her golden rod and turned by her poisons into a bird"
4401,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",with patches of colour on his wings. Of such wise was the temple of the
4402,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","gods wherein Latinus, sitting on his father's seat, summoned the"
4403,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","Teucrians to his house and presence; and when they entered in, he thus"
4404,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",opened with placid mien:
4405,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",
4406,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","'Tell, O Dardanians, for we are not ignorant of your city and race, nor"
4407,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","unheard of do you bend your course [197-228]overseas, what seek you?"
4408,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",what the cause or whereof the need that hath borne you over all these
4409,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","blue waterways to the Ausonian shore? Whether wandering in your course,"
4410,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",or tempest-driven (such perils manifold on the high seas do sailors
4411,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","suffer), you have entered the river banks and lie in harbour; shun not"
4412,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","our welcome, and be not ignorant that the Latins are Saturn's people,"
4413,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","whom no laws fetter to justice, upright of their own free will and the"
4414,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","custom of the god of old. And now I remember, though the story is dimmed"
4415,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","with years, thus Auruncan elders told, how Dardanus, born in this our"
4416,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","country, made his way to the towns of Phrygian Ida and to the Thracian"
4417,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","Samos that is now called Samothrace. Here was the home he left,"
4418,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","Tyrrhenian Corythus; now the palace of heaven, glittering with golden"
4419,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","stars, enthrones and adds him to the ranged altars of the gods.'"
4420,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",
4421,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",He ended; and Ilioneus pursued his speech with these words:
4422,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",
4423,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","'King, Faunus' illustrious progeny, neither hath black tempest driven us"
4424,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","with stress of waves to shelter in your lands, nor hath star or shore"
4425,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",misled us on the way we went. Of set purpose and willing mind do we draw
4426,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","nigh this thy city, outcasts from a realm once the greatest that the sun"
4427,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",looked on as he came from Olympus' utmost border. From Jove hath our
4428,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",race beginning; in Jove the men of Dardania rejoice as ancestor; our
4429,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","King himself of Jove's supreme race, Aeneas of Troy, hath sent us to thy"
4430,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",courts. How terrible the tempest that burst from fierce Mycenae over the
4431,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","plains of Ida, driven by what fate Europe and Asia met in the shock of"
4432,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","two worlds, even he hath heard who is sundered in the utmost land where"
4433,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","the ocean surge recoils, and he whom stretching midmost of the four"
4434,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",zones the zone of the intolerable sun holds in severance. Borne by that
4435,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","flood over many desolate seas, we crave a scant dwelling [229-261]for"
4436,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","our country's gods, an unmolested landing-place, and the air and water"
4437,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",that are free to all. We shall not disgrace the kingdom; nor will the
4438,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",rumour of your renown be lightly gone or the grace of all you have done
4439,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",fade away; nor will Ausonia be sorry to have taken Troy to her breast.
4440,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","By the fortunes of Aeneas I swear, by that right hand mighty, whether"
4441,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","tried in friendship or in warlike arms, many and many a people and"
4442,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",nation--scorn us not because we advance with hands proffering chaplets
4443,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",and words of supplication--hath sought us for itself and desired our
4444,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",alliance; but yours is the land that heaven's high ordinance drove us
4445,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","forth to find. Hence sprung Dardanus: hither Apollo recalls us, and"
4446,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",pushes us on with imperious orders to Tyrrhenian Tiber and the holy
4447,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","pools of Numicus' spring. Further, he presents to thee these small"
4448,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","guerdons of our past estate, relics saved from burning Troy. From this"
4449,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",gold did lord Anchises pour libation at the altars; this was Priam's
4450,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",array when he delivered statutes to the nations assembled in order; the
4451,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","sceptre, the sacred mitre, the raiment wrought by the women of"
4452,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",Ilium. . . .'
4453,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",
4454,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",At these words of Ilioneus Latinus holds his countenance in a steady
4455,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","gaze, and stays motionless on the floor, casting his intent eyes around."
4456,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","Nor does the embroidered purple so move the King, nor the sceptre of"
4457,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","Priam, as his daughter's marriage and the bridal chamber absorb him, and"
4458,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","the oracle of ancient Faunus stirs deep in his heart. This is he, the"
4459,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","wanderer from a foreign home, foreshewn of fate for his son, and called"
4460,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","to a realm of equal dominion, whose race should be excellent in valour"
4461,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",and their might overbear all the world. At last he speaks with good
4462,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",cheer:
4463,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",
4464,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",'The gods prosper our undertaking and their own augury! What thou
4465,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","desirest, Trojan, shall be given; nor do I spurn your gifts. While"
4466,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",Latinus reigns you shall not [262-294]lack foison of rich land nor
4467,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","Troy's own riches. Only let Aeneas himself come hither, if desire of us"
4468,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","be so strong, if he be in haste to join our friendship and be called our"
4469,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",ally. Let him not shrink in terror from a friendly face. A term of the
4470,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",peace for me shall be to touch your monarch's hand. Do you now convey in
4471,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",answer my message to your King. I have a daughter whom the oracles of my
4472,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",father's shrine and many a celestial token alike forbid me to unite to
4473,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","one of our own nation; sons shall come, they prophesy, from foreign"
4474,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","coasts, such is the destiny of Latium, whose blood shall exalt our name"
4475,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","to heaven. He it is on whom fate calls; this I think, this I choose, if"
4476,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",there be any truth in my soul's foreshadowing.'
4477,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",
4478,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","Thus he speaks, and chooses horses for all the company. Three hundred"
4479,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",stood sleek in their high stalls; for all the Teucrians in order he
4480,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","straightway commands them to be led forth, fleet-footed, covered with"
4481,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","embroidered purple: golden chains hang drooping over their chests,"
4482,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","golden their housings, and they champ on bits of ruddy gold: for the"

4484,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",with nostrils breathing flame; of the race of those which subtle Circe
4485,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","bred by sleight on her father, the bastard issue of a stolen union. With"
4486,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",these gifts and words the Aeneadae ride back from Latinus carrying
4487,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",peace.
4488,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",
4489,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","And lo! the fierce wife of Jove was returning from Inachian Argos, and"
4490,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","held her way along the air, when out of the distant sky, far as from"
4491,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","Sicilian Pachynus, she espied the rejoicing of Aeneas and the Dardanian"
4492,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","fleet. She sees them already house-building, already trusting in the"
4493,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","land, their ships left empty. She stops, shot with sharp pain; then"
4494,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","shaking her head, she pours forth these words:"
4495,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",
4496,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","'Ah, hated brood, and doom of the Phrygians that thwarts our doom! Could"
4497,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",they perish on the Sigean [295-326]plains? Could they be ensnared when
4498,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",taken? Did the fires of Troy consume her people? Through the midst of
4499,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","armies and through the midst of flames they have found their way. But, I"
4500,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","think, my deity lies at last outwearied, or my hatred sleeps and is"
4501,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","satisfied? Nay, it is I who have been fierce to follow them over the"
4502,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","waves when hurled from their country, and on all the seas have crossed"
4503,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",their flight. Against the Teucrians the forces of sky and sea are spent.
4504,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","What hath availed me Syrtes or Scylla, what desolate Charybdis? they"
4505,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","find shelter in their desired Tiber-bed, careless of ocean and of me."
4506,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",Mars availed to destroy the giant race of the Lapithae; the very father
4507,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",of the gods gave over ancient Calydon to Diana's wrath: for forfeit of
4508,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","what crime in the Lapithae, what in Calydon? But I, Jove's imperial"
4509,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","consort, who have borne, ah me! to leave naught undared, who have"
4510,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","shifted to every device, I am vanquished by Aeneas. If my deity is not"
4511,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","great enough, I will not assuredly falter to seek succour where it may"
4512,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","be; if the powers of heaven are inflexible, I will stir up Acheron. It"
4513,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",may not be to debar him of a Latin realm; well; and Lavinia is destined
4514,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","his bride unalterably. But it may be yet to defer, to make all this"
4515,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",action linger; but it may be yet to waste away the nation of either
4516,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",king; at such forfeit of their people may son-in-law and father-in-law
4517,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","enter into union. Blood of Troy and Rutulia shall be thy dower, O"
4518,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","maiden, and Bellona is the bridesmaid who awaits thee. Nor did Cisseus'"

4527,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","hell-born sisters; into so many faces does she turn, so savage the guise"
4528,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","of each, so thick and black bristles she with vipers. And her Juno spurs"
4529,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","on with words, saying thus:"

4531,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","'Grant me, virgin born of Night, this thy proper task and service, that"

4534,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","canst set brothers once united in armed conflict, and overturn families"
4535,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",with hatreds; thou canst launch into houses thy whips and deadly brands;
4536,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","thine are a thousand names, a thousand devices of injury. Stir up thy"

4539,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",
4540,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","Thereon Allecto, steeped in Gorgonian venom, first seeks Latium and the"

4543,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",the Teucrians' coming and the marriage of Turnus. At her the goddess

4583,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","thee she circles in the dance, to thee she trains and consecrates her"

4586,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","strange dwellings. They have left their homes empty, they throw neck and"
4587,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","hair free to the winds; while others fill the air with ringing cries,"
4588,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","girt about with fawnskins, and carrying spears of vine. Amid them the"

4591,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","cries sudden and harsh: 'Hear, O mothers of Latium, wheresoever you be;"

4603,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",name; but its fortune is no more. Here in his high house Turnus now took
4604,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",rest in the black midnight. Allecto puts off her grim feature and the
4605,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","body of a Fury; she transforms her face to an aged woman's, and furrows"
4606,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","her brow with ugly wrinkles; she puts on white tresses chaplet-bound,"
4607,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","and entwines them with an olive spray; she becomes aged Calybe,"
4608,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","priestess of Juno's temple, and presents herself before his eyes,"
4609,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",uttering thus:
4610,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",
4611,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","'Turnus, wilt thou brook all these toils poured out in vain, and the"
4612,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",conveyance of thy crown to Dardanian settlers? The King denies thee thy
4613,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",bride and the dower thy blood had earned; and a foreigner is sought for
4614,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","heir to the kingdom. Forth now, dupe, and face thankless perils; forth,"
4615,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",cut down the Tyrrhenian lines; give the [427-458]Latins peace in thy
4616,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",protection. This Saturn's omnipotent daughter in very presence commanded
4617,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","me to pronounce to thee, as thou wert lying in the still night."
4618,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","Wherefore arise, and make ready with good cheer to arm thy people and"
4619,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",march through thy gates to battle; consume those Phrygian captains that
4620,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",lie with their painted hulls in the beautiful river. All the force of
4621,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","heaven orders thee on. Let King Latinus himself know of it, unless he"
4622,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","consents to give thee thy bridal, and abide by his words, when he shall"
4623,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",at last make proof of Turnus' arms.'
4624,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",
4625,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","But he, deriding her inspiration, with the words of his mouth thus"
4626,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",answers her again:
4627,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",
4628,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","'The fleets ride on the Tiber wave; that news hath not, as thou deemest,"
4629,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",escaped mine ears. Frame not such terrors before me. Neither is Queen
4630,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","Juno forgetful of us. . . . But thee, O mother, overworn old age,"
4631,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","exhausted and untrue, frets with vain distress, and amid embattled kings"
4632,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",mocks thy presage with false dismay. Thy charge it is to keep the divine
4633,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",image and temple; war and peace shall be in the hands of men and
4634,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",warriors.'
4635,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",
4636,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",At such words Allecto's wrath blazed out. But amid his utterance a quick
4637,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",shudder overruns his limbs; his eyes are fixed in horror; so thickly
4638,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","hiss the snakes of the Fury, so vast her form expands. Then rolling her"
4639,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","fiery eyes, she thrust him back as he would stammer out more, raised two"
4640,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","serpents in her hair, and, sounding her whip, resumed with furious tone:"
4641,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",
4642,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","'Behold me the overworn! me whom old age, exhausted and untrue, mocks"
4643,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",with false dismay amid embattled kings! Look on this! I am come from the
4644,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",home of the Dread Sisters: war and death are in my hand. . . .'
4645,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",
4646,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","So speaking, she hurled her torch at him, and pierced his breast with"
4647,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","the lurid smoking brand. He breaks from sleep in overpowering fear, his"
4648,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",limbs and body bathed in [459-494]sweat that breaks out all over him;
4649,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","he shrieks madly for arms, searches for arms on his bed and in his"
4650,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","palace. The passion of the sword rages high, the accursed fury of war,"
4651,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",and wrath over all: even as when flaming sticks are heaped roaring loud
4652,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","under the sides of a seething cauldron, and the boiling water leaps up;"
4653,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",the river of water within smokes furiously and swells high in
4654,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","overflowing foam, and now the wave contains itself no longer; the dark"
4655,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","steam flies aloft. So, for the stain of the broken peace, he orders his"
4656,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","chief warriors to march on King Latinus, and bids prepare for battle, to"
4657,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",defend Italy and drive the foe from their borders; himself will suffice
4658,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",for Trojans and Latins together. When he uttered these words and called
4659,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","the gods to hear his vows, the Rutulians stir one another up to arms."
4660,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","One is moved by the splendour of his youthful beauty, one by his royal"
4661,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","ancestry, another by the noble deeds of his hand."
4662,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",
4663,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","While Turnus fills the Rutulian minds with valour, Allecto on Stygian"
4664,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",wing hastens towards the Trojans. With fresh wiles she marked the spot
4665,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",where beautiful IÃ¼lus was trapping and coursing game on the bank; here
4666,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",the infernal maiden suddenly crosses his hounds with the maddening touch
4667,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","of a familiar scent, and drives them hotly on the stag-hunt. This was"
4668,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","the source and spring of ill, and kindled the country-folk to war. The"
4669,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","stag, beautiful and high-antlered, was stolen from his mother's udder"
4670,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","and bred by Tyrrheus' boys and their father Tyrrheus, master of the"
4671,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","royal herds, and ranger of the plain. Their sister Silvia tamed him to"
4672,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","her rule, and lavished her care on his adornment, twining his antlers"
4673,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","with delicate garlands, and combed his wild coat and washed him in the"
4674,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","clear spring. Tame to her hand, and familiar to his master's table, he"
4675,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","would wander the woods, and, however late the night, return home to the"
4676,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","door he knew. Far astray, he floated idly down the stream, and allayed"
4677,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","his heat on the green bank, when IÃ¼lus' [495-528]mad hounds started him"
4678,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","in their hunting; and Ascanius himself, kindled with desire of the chief"
4679,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","honour, aimed a shaft from his bended bow. A present deity suffered not"
4680,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","his hand to stray, and the loud whistling reed came driven through his"
4681,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",belly and flanks. But the wounded beast fled within the familiar roof
4682,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","and crept moaning to the courtyard, dabbled with blood, and filling all"
4683,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","the house with moans as of one beseeching. Sister Silvia, smiting her"

4687,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","stake hardened in the fire, one with a heavy knotted trunk; what each"
4688,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","one searches and finds, wrath turns into a weapon. Tyrrheus cheers on"
4689,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","his array, panting hard, with his axe caught up in his hand, as he was"
4690,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",haply splitting an oaken log in four clefts with cross-driven wedges.

4695,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","spread shuddering over all the woodland, and echoed through the deep"
4696,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",forests: the lake of Trivia heard it afar; Nar river heard it with white
4697,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","sulphurous water, and the springs of Velinus; and fluttered mothers"
4698,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","clasped their children to their breast. Then, hurrying to the voice of"

4702,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",rustic strife do they fight with hard trunks or burned stakes; the
4703,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","two-edged steel sways the fight, the broad cornfields bristle dark with"
4704,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","drawn swords, and brass flashes smitten by the sunlight, and casts a"
4705,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",gleam high into the cloudy air: as when the wind begins to blow and the

4707,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","yet higher, then rises from the bottom right into the air. Here in the"

4710,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",the moist voice's passage and the thin life. Around many a one lies
4711,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","dead, aged Galaesus among them, slain as he throws himself between them"

4924,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY",recalled by Diana's love and the drugs of the Healer. Then the Lord
4925,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","omnipotent, indignant that any mortal should rise from the nether shades"
4926,"THE LANDING IN LATIUM, AND THE ROLL OF THE ARMIES OF ITALY","to the light of life, launched his thunder and hurled down to the"

4975,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"When Turnus ran up the flag of war on the towers of Laurentum, and the"
4976,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"trumpets blared with harsh music, when he spurred his fiery steeds and"
4977,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"clashed his armour, straightway men's hearts are in tumult; all Latium"
4978,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"at once flutters in banded uprisal, and her warriors rage furiously."
4979,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Their chiefs, Messapus, and Ufens, and Mezentius, scorner of the gods,"
4980,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"begin to enrol forces on all sides, and dispeople the wide fields of"
4981,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,husbandmen. Venulus too is sent to the town of mighty Diomede to seek
4982,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"succour, to instruct him that Teucrians set foot in Latium; that Aeneas"
4983,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"in his fleet invades them with the vanquished gods of his home, and"
4984,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,proclaims himself the King summoned of fate; that many tribes join the
4985,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Dardanian, and his name swells high in Latium. What he will rear on"
4986,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"these foundations, what issue of battle he desires, if Fortune attend"
4987,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"him, lies clearer to his own sight than to King Turnus or King Latinus."
4988,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,
4989,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Thus was it in Latium. And the hero of Laomedon's blood, seeing it all,"
4990,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"tosses on a heavy surge of care, and throws his mind rapidly this way"
4991,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"and that, and turns it on all hands in swift change of thought: even as"
4992,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"when the quivering light of water brimming in brass, struck back"
4993,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"[23-56]from the sunlight or the moon's glittering reflection, flickers"
4994,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"abroad over all the room, and now mounts aloft and strikes the high"
4995,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"panelled roof. Night fell, and over all lands weary creatures were fast"
4996,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"in deep slumber, the race of fowl and of cattle; when lord Aeneas, sick"
4997,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"at heart of the dismal warfare, stretched him on the river bank under"
4998,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"the cope of the cold sky, and let sleep, though late, overspread his"
4999,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"limbs. To him the very god of the ground, the pleasant Tiber stream,"
5000,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,seemed to raise his aged form among the poplar boughs; thin lawn veiled
5001,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"him with its gray covering, and shadowy reeds hid his hair. Thereon he"
5002,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"addressed him thus, and with these words allayed his distresses:"
5003,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,
5004,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"'O born of the family of the gods, thou who bearest back our Trojan city"
5005,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"from hostile hands, and keepest Troy towers in eternal life; O long"
5006,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,looked for on Laurentine ground and Latin fields! here is thine assured
5007,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"home, thine home's assured gods. Draw not thou back, nor be alarmed by"
5008,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,menace of war. All the anger and wrath of the gods is passed away . . .
5009,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"And even now for thine assurance, that thou think not this the idle"
5010,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"fashioning of sleep, a great sow shall be found lying under the oaks on"
5011,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"the shore, with her new-born litter of thirty head: white she couches on"
5012,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"the ground, and the brood about her teats is white. By this token in"
5013,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"thirty revolving years shall Ascanius found a city, Alba of bright name."
5014,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"My prophecy is sure. Now hearken, and I will briefly instruct thee how"
5015,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,thou mayest unravel and overcome thy present task. An Arcadian people
5016,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"sprung of Pallas, following in their king Evander's company beneath his"
5017,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"banners, have chosen a place in these coasts, and set a city on the"
5018,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"hills, called Pallanteum after Pallas their forefather. These wage"
5019,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,perpetual war with the Latin race; these do thou take to thy camp's
5020,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"alliance, and join with them in league. Myself I [57-89]will lead thee"
5021,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"by my banks and straight along my stream, that thou mayest oar thy way"
5022,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"upward against the river. Up and arise, goddess-born, and even with the"
5023,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"setting stars address thy prayers to Juno as is meet, and vanquish her"
5024,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,wrath and menaces with humble vows. To me thou shalt pay a conqueror's
5025,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,sacrifice. I am he whom thou seest washing the banks with full flood and
5026,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"severing the rich tilth, glassy Tiber, best beloved by heaven of rivers."
5027,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,Here is my stately home; my fountain-head is among high cities.'
5028,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,
5029,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Thus spoke the River, and sank in the depth of the pool: night and sleep"
5030,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"left Aeneas. He arises, and, looking towards the radiant sky of the"
5031,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"sunrising, holds up water from the river in fitly-hollowed palms, and"
5032,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,pours to heaven these accents:
5033,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,
5034,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"'Nymphs, Laurentine Nymphs, from whom is the generation of rivers, and"
5035,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"thou, O father Tiber, with thine holy flood, receive Aeneas and deign to"
5036,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"save him out of danger. What pool soever holds thy source, who pitiest"
5037,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"our discomforts, from whatsoever soil thou dost spring excellent in"
5038,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"beauty, ever shall my worship, ever my gifts frequent thee, the hornÃ¨d"
5039,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"river lord of Hesperian waters. Ah, be thou only by me, and graciously"
5040,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"confirm thy will.' So speaks he, and chooses two galleys from his fleet,"
5041,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"and mans them with rowers, and withal equips a crew with arms."
5042,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,
5043,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"And lo! suddenly, ominous and wonderful to tell, the milk-white sow, of"
5044,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"one colour with her white brood, is espied through the forest couched on"
5045,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"the green brink; whom to thee, yes to thee, queenly Juno, good Aeneas"
5046,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"offers in sacrifice, and sets with her offspring before thine altar. All"
5047,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"that night long Tiber assuaged his swelling stream, and silently stayed"
5048,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"his refluent wave, smoothing the surface of his waters to the fashion of"
5049,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"still pool and quiet mere, to spare [90-121]labour to the oar. So they"
5050,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,set out and speed on their way with prosperous cries; the painted fir
5051,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,slides along the waterway; the waves and unwonted woods marvel at their
5052,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"far-gleaming shields, and the gay hulls afloat on the river. They"
5053,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"outwear a night and a day in rowing, ascend the long reaches, and pass"
5054,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"under the chequered shadows of the trees, and cut through the green"
5055,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,woodland in the calm water. The fiery sun had climbed midway in the
5056,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,circle of the sky when they see afar fortress walls and scattered house
5057,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"roofs, where now the might of Rome hath risen high as heaven; then"
5058,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,Evander held a slender state. Quickly they turn their prows to land and
5059,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,draw near the town.
5060,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,
5061,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,It chanced on that day the Arcadian king paid his accustomed sacrifice
5062,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,to the great son of Amphitryon and all the gods in a grove before the
5063,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"city. With him his son Pallas, with him all the chief of his people and"
5064,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"his poor senate were offering incense, and the blood steamed warm at"
5065,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"their altars. When they saw the high ships, saw them glide up between"
5066,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"the shady woodlands and rest on their silent oars, the sudden sight"
5067,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"appals them, and all at once they rise and stop the banquet. Pallas"
5068,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"courageously forbids them to break off the rites; snatching up a spear,"
5069,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"he flies forward, and from a hillock cries afar: 'O men, what cause hath"
5070,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,driven you to explore these unknown ways? or whither do you steer? What
5071,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"is your kin, whence your habitation? Is it peace or arms you carry"
5072,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"hither?' Then from the lofty stern lord Aeneas thus speaks, stretching"
5073,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,forth in his hand an olive bough of peace-bearing:
5074,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,
5075,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"'Thou seest men born of Troy and arms hostile to the Latins, who have"
5076,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,driven us to flight in insolent warfare. We seek Evander; carry this
5077,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"message, and tell him that chosen men of the Dardanian captains are come"
5078,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,pleading for an armed alliance.'
5079,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,
5080,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Pallas stood amazed at the august name. 'Descend,' [122-154]he cries,"
5081,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"'whoso thou art, and speak with my father face to face, and enter our"
5082,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"home and hospitality.' And giving him the grasp of welcome, he caught"
5083,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"and clung to his hand. Advancing, they enter the grove and leave the"
5084,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,river. Then Aeneas in courteous words addresses the King:
5085,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,
5086,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"'Best of the Grecian race, thou whom fortune hath willed that I"
5087,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"supplicate, holding before me boughs dressed in fillets, no fear stayed"
5088,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"me because thou wert a Grecian chief and an Arcadian, or allied by"
5089,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"descent to the twin sons of Atreus. Nay, mine own prowess and the"
5090,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"sanctity of divine oracles, our ancestral kinship, and the fame of thee"
5091,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"that is spread abroad over the earth, have allied me to thee and led me"
5092,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"willingly on the path of fate. Dardanus, who sailed to the Teucrian"
5093,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"land, the first father and founder of the Ilian city, was born, as"
5094,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Greeks relate, of Electra the Atlantid; Electra's sire is ancient Atlas,"
5095,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"whose shoulder sustains the heavenly spheres. Your father is Mercury,"
5096,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,whom white Maia conceived and bore on the cold summit of Cyllene; but
5097,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Maia, if we give any credence to report, is daughter of Atlas, that same"
5098,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,Atlas who bears up the starry heavens; so both our families branch from
5099,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"a single blood. In this confidence I sent no embassy, I framed no crafty"
5100,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"overtures; myself I have presented mine own person, and come a suppliant"
5101,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,to thy courts. The same Daunian race pursues us and thee in merciless
5102,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"warfare; we once expelled, they trust nothing will withhold them from"
5103,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"laying all Hesperia wholly beneath their yoke, and holding the seas that"
5104,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,wash it above and below. Accept and return our friendship. We can give
5105,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"brave hearts in war, high souls and men approved in deeds.'"
5106,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,
5107,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,Aeneas ended. The other ere now scanned in a long gaze the face and eyes
5108,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,and all the form of the speaker; then thus briefly returns:
5109,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,
5110,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"'How gladly, bravest of the Teucrians, do I hail and [155-188]own thee!"
5111,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,how I recall thy father's words and the very tone and glance of great
5112,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Anchises! For I remember how Priam son of Laomedon, when he sought"
5113,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Salamis on his way to the realm of his sister Hesione, went on to visit"
5114,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,the cold borders of Arcadia. Then early youth clad my cheeks with bloom.
5115,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"I admired the Teucrian captains, admired their lord, the son of"
5116,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,Laomedon; but Anchises moved high above them all. My heart burned with
5117,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,youthful passion to accost him and clasp hand in hand; I made my way to
5118,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"him, and led him eagerly to Pheneus' high town. Departing he gave me an"
5119,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"adorned quiver and Lycian arrows, a scarf inwoven with gold, and a pair"
5120,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,of golden bits that now my Pallas possesses. Therefore my hand is
5121,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"already joined in the alliance you seek, and soon as to-morrow's dawn"
5122,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"rises again over earth, I will send you away rejoicing in mine aid, and"
5123,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"supply you from my store. Meanwhile, since you are come hither in"
5124,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"friendship, solemnise with us these yearly rites which we may not defer,"
5125,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,and even now learn to be familiar at your comrades' board.'
5126,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,
5127,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"This said, he commands the feast and the wine-cups to be replaced whence"
5128,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"they were taken, and with his own hand ranges them on the grassy seat,"
5129,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"and welcomes Aeneas to the place of honour, with a lion's shaggy fell"
5130,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,for cushion and a hospitable chair of maple. Then chosen men with the
5131,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"priest of the altar in emulous haste bring roasted flesh of bulls, and"
5132,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"pile baskets with the gift of ground corn, and serve the wine. Aeneas"
5133,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,and the men of Troy with him feed on the long chines of oxen and the
5134,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,entrails of the sacrifice.
5135,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,
5136,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"After hunger is driven away and the desire of food stayed, King Evander"
5137,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,speaks: 'No idle superstition that knows not the gods of old hath
5138,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"ordered these our solemn rites, this customary feast, this altar of"
5139,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"august sanctity; saved from bitter perils, O Trojan guest, do we"
5140,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"worship, and [189-225]most due are the rites we inaugurate. Look now"
5141,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"first on this overhanging cliff of stone, where shattered masses lie"
5142,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"strewn, and the mountain dwelling stands desolate, and rocks are rent"
5143,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"away in vast ruin. Here was a cavern, awful and deep-withdrawn,"
5144,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"impenetrable to the sunbeams, where the monstrous half-human shape of"
5145,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Cacus had his hold: the ground was ever wet with fresh slaughter, and"
5146,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"pallid faces of men, ghastly with gore, hung nailed on the haughty"
5147,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"doors. This monster was the son of Vulcan, and spouted his black fires"
5148,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,from his mouth as he moved in giant bulk. To us also in our desire time
5149,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,bore a god's aid and arrival. For princely Alcides the avenger came
5150,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,glorious in the spoils of triple Geryon slain; this way the Conqueror
5151,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"drove the huge bulls, and his oxen filled the river valley. But savage"
5152,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Cacus, infatuate to leave nothing undared or unhandled in craft or"
5153,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"crime, drives four bulls of choice shape away from their pasturage, and"
5154,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"as many heifers of excellent beauty. And these, that there should be no"
5155,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"straightforward footprints, he dragged by the tail into his cavern, the"
5156,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"track of their compelled path reversed, and hid them behind the screen"
5157,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,of rock. No marks were there to lead a seeker to the cavern. Meanwhile
5158,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"the son of Amphitryon, his herds filled with food, was now breaking up"
5159,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,his pasturage and making ready to go. The oxen low as they depart; all
5160,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,the woodland is filled with their complaint as they clamorously quit the
5161,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"hills. One heifer returned the cry, and, lowing from the depth of the"
5162,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"dreary cave, baffled the hope of Cacus from her imprisonment. At this"
5163,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,the grief and choler of Alcides blazed forth dark and infuriate. Seizing
5164,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"in his hand his club of heavy knotted oak, he seeks with swift pace the"
5165,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"aery mountain steep. Then, as never before, did we see Cacus afraid and"
5166,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,his countenance troubled; he goes flying swifter than the wind and seeks
5167,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"his cavern; fear wings his feet. As he shut himself in, and, bursting"
5168,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"the [226-260]chains, dropped the vast rock slung in iron by his"
5169,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"father's craft, and blocked the doorway with its pressure, lo! the"
5170,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Tirynthian came in furious wrath, and, scanning all the entry, turned"
5171,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"his face this way and that and ground his teeth. Thrice, hot with rage,"
5172,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,he circles all Mount Aventine; thrice he assails the rocky portals in
5173,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,vain; thrice he sinks down outwearied in the valley. There stood a sharp
5174,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"rock of flint with sides cut sheer away, rising over the cavern's ridge"
5175,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"a vast height to see, fit haunt for foul birds to build on. This--for,"
5176,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"sloping from the ridge, it leaned on the left towards the river--he"
5177,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"loosened, urging it from the right till he tore it loose from its deep"
5178,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,foundations; then suddenly shook it free; with the shock the vast sky
5179,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"thunders, the banks leap apart, and the amazed river recoils. But the"
5180,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"den, Cacus' huge palace, lay open and revealed, and the depths of gloomy"
5181,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,cavern were made manifest; even as though some force tearing earth apart
5182,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"should unlock the infernal house, and disclose the pallid realms"
5183,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"abhorred of heaven, and deep down the monstrous gulf be descried where"
5184,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"the ghosts flutter in the streaming daylight. On him then, surprised in"
5185,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"unexpected light, shut in the rock's recesses and howling in strange"
5186,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"fashion, Alcides from above hurls missiles and calls all his arms to"
5187,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"aid, and presses hard on him with boughs and enormous millstones. And"
5188,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"he, for none other escape from peril is left, vomits from his throat"
5189,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"vast jets of smoke, wonderful to tell, and enwreathes his dwelling in"
5190,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"blind gloom, blotting view from the eyes, while in the cave's depth"
5191,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,night thickens with smoke-bursts in a darkness shot with fire. Alcides
5192,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"broke forth in anger, and with a bound hurled himself sheer amid the"
5193,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"flames, where the smoke rolls billowing and voluminous, and the cloud"
5194,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"surges black through the enormous den. Here, as Cacus in the darkness"
5195,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"spouts forth his idle fires, he grasps and twines tight round him, till"
5196,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,his eyes start out and his throat [261-295]is drained of blood under
5197,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,the strangling pressure. Straightway the doors are torn open and the
5198,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,dark house laid plain; the stolen oxen and forsworn plunder are shewn
5199,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"forth to heaven, and the misshapen carcase dragged forward by the feet."
5200,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Men cannot satisfy their soul with gazing on the terrible eyes, the"
5201,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"monstrous face and shaggy bristling chest, and the throat with its"
5202,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"quenched fires. Thenceforth this sacrifice is solemnised, and a younger"
5203,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"race have gladly kept the day; Potitius the inaugurator, and the"
5204,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Pinarian family, guardians of the rites of Hercules, have set in the"
5205,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"grove this altar, which shall ever be called of us Most Mighty, and"
5206,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"shall be our mightiest evermore. Wherefore arise, O men, and enwreathe"
5207,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"your hair with leafy sprays, and stretch forth the cups in your hands;"
5208,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,call on our common god and pour the glad wine.' He ended; when the
5209,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,twy-coloured poplar of Hercules hid his shaded hair with pendulous
5210,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"plaited leaf, and the sacred goblet filled his hand. Speedily all pour"
5211,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"glad libation on the board, and supplicate the gods."
5212,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,
5213,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Meanwhile the evening star draws nigher down the slope of heaven, and"
5214,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"now the priests went forth, Potitius at their head, girt with skins"
5215,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"after their fashion, and bore torches aflame. They renew the banquet,"
5216,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"and bring the grateful gift of a second repast, and heap the altars with"
5217,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"loaded platters. Then the Salii stand round the lit altar-fires to sing,"
5218,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"their brows bound with poplar boughs, one chorus of young men, one of"
5219,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"elders, and extol in song the praises and deeds of Hercules; how first"
5220,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"he strangled in his gripe the twin terrors, the snakes of his"
5221,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"stepmother; how he likewise shattered in war famous cities, Troy and"
5222,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,Oechalia; how under Eurystheus the King he bore the toil of a thousand
5223,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"labours by Juno's malign decrees. Thine hand, unconquered, slays the"
5224,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"cloud-born double-bodied race, Hylaeus and Pholus, the Cretan monster,"
5225,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,and the huge lion in the hollow Nemean rock. Before thee the Stygian
5226,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"pools [296-329]shook for fear, before thee the warder of hell, couched"
5227,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,on half-gnawn bones in his blood-stained cavern; to thee not any form
5228,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"was terrible, not Typhoeus' self towering in arms; thou wast not bereft"
5229,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,of counsel when the snake of Lerna encompassed thee with thronging
5230,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"heads. Hail, true seed of Jove, deified glory! graciously visit us and"
5231,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,these thy rites with favourable feet. Such are their songs of praise;
5232,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,they crown all with the cavern of Cacus and its fire-breathing lord. All
5233,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"the woodland echoes with their clamour, and the hills resound."
5234,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,
5235,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Thence all at once, the sacred rites accomplished, retrace their way to"
5236,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,the city. The age-worn King walked holding Aeneas and his son by his
5237,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"side for companions on his way, and lightened the road with changing"
5238,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"talk. Aeneas admires and turns his eyes lightly round about, pleased"
5239,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,with the country; and gladly on spot after spot inquires and hears of
5240,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"the memorials of earlier men. Then King Evander, founder of the fortress"
5241,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,of Rome:
5242,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,
5243,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"'In these woodlands dwelt Fauns and Nymphs sprung of the soil, and a"
5244,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,tribe of men born of stocks and hard oak; who had neither law nor grace
5245,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"of life, nor did they know to yoke bulls or lay up stores or save their"
5246,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"gains, but were nurtured by the forest boughs and the hard living of the"
5247,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,huntsman. Long ago Saturn came from heaven on high in flight before
5248,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Jove's arms, an exile from his lost realm. He gathered together the"
5249,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"unruly race scattered on the mountain heights, and gave them statutes,"
5250,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"and chose Latium to be their name, since in these borders he had found a"
5251,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"safe hiding-place. Beneath his reign were the ages named of gold; thus,"
5252,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"in peace and quietness, did he rule the nations; till gradually there"
5253,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"crept in a sunken and stained time, the rage of war, and the lust of"
5254,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"possession. Then came the Ausonian clan and the tribes of Sicania, and"
5255,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"many a time the land of Saturn put away her name. Then were kings,"
5256,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"[330-364]and fierce Thybris with his giant bulk, from whose name we of"
5257,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Italy afterwards called the Tiber river, when it lost the true name of"
5258,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"old, Albula. Me, cast out from my country and following the utmost"
5259,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"limits of the sea, Fortune the omnipotent and irreversible doom settled"
5260,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,in this region; and my mother the Nymph Carmentis' awful warnings and
5261,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,Apollo's divine counsel drove me hither.'
5262,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,
5263,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,Scarce was this said; next advancing he points out the altar and the
5264,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Carmental Gate, which the Romans call anciently by that name in honour"
5265,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"of the Nymph Carmentis, seer and soothsayer, who sang of old the coming"
5266,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,greatness of the Aeneadae and the glory of Pallanteum. Next he points
5267,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"out the wide grove where valiant Romulus set his sanctuary, and the"
5268,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Lupercal in the cool hollow of the rock, dedicate to Lycean Pan after"
5269,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,the manner of Parrhasia. Therewithal he shows the holy wood of
5270,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Argiletum, and calls the spot to witness as he tells the slaying of his"
5271,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"guest Argus. Hence he leads him to the Tarpeian house, and the Capitol"
5272,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"golden now, of old rough with forest thickets. Even then men trembled"
5273,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"before the wood and rock. 'This grove,' he cries, 'this hill with its"
5274,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"leafy crown, is a god's dwelling, though whose we know not; the"
5275,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Arcadians believe Jove himself hath been visible, when often he shook"
5276,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,the darkening aegis in his hand and gathered the storm-clouds. Thou
5277,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"seest these two towns likewise with walls overthrown, relics and"
5278,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"memorials of men of old. This fortress lord Janus built, this Saturn;"
5279,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"the name of this was once Janiculum, of that Saturnia.'"
5280,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,
5281,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"With such mutual words they drew nigh the house of poor Evander, and saw"
5282,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,scattered herds lowing on the Roman Forum and down the gay Carinae. When
5283,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"they reached his dwelling, 'This threshold,' he cries, 'Alcides the"
5284,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Conqueror stooped to cross; in this palace he rested. Dare thou, my"
5285,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"guest, to despise riches; mould thyself to [365-396]like dignity of"
5286,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"godhead, and come not exacting to our poverty.' He spoke, and led tall"
5287,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Aeneas under the low roof of his narrow dwelling, and laid him on a"
5288,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,couch of stuffed leaves and the skin of a Libyan she-bear. Night falls
5289,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,and clasps the earth in her dusky wings.
5290,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,
5291,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"But Venus, stirred in spirit by no vain mother's alarms, and moved by"
5292,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"the threats and stern uprisal of the Laurentines, addresses herself to"
5293,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Vulcan, and in her golden bridal chamber begins thus, breathing divine"
5294,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,passion in her speech:
5295,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,
5296,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"'While Argolic kings wasted in war the doomed towers of Troy, the"
5297,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"fortress fated to fall in hostile fires, no succour did I require for"
5298,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"her wretched people, no weapons of thine art and aid: nor would I task,"
5299,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"dear my lord, thee or thy toils for naught, though I owed many and many"
5300,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"a debt to the children of Priam, and had often wept the sore labour of"
5301,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,Aeneas. Now by Jove's commands he hath set foot in the Rutulian borders;
5302,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"I now therefore come with entreaty, and ask armour of the god I worship."
5303,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"For the son she bore, the tears of Nereus' daughter, of Tithonus'"
5304,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"consort, could melt thine heart. Look what nations are gathering, what"
5305,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,cities bar their gates and sharpen the sword against me for the
5306,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,desolation of my children.'
5307,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,
5308,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"The goddess ended, and, as he hesitates, clasps him round in the soft"
5309,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"embrace of her snowy arms. He suddenly caught the wonted flame, and the"
5310,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,heat known of old pierced him to the heart and overran his melting
5311,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"frame: even as when, bursting from the thunder peal, a sparkling cleft"
5312,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,of fire shoots through the storm-clouds with dazzling light. His consort
5313,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"knew, rejoiced in her wiles, and felt her beauty. Then her lord speaks,"
5314,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,enchained by Love the immortal:
5315,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,
5316,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"'Why these far-fetched pleas? Whither, O goddess, is thy trust in me"
5317,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"gone? Had like distress been thine, [397-431]even then we might"
5318,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"unblamed have armed thy Trojans, nor did doom nor the Lord omnipotent"
5319,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"forbid Troy to stand, and Priam to survive yet ten other years. And now,"
5320,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"if thou purposest war, and this is thy counsel, whatever charge I can"
5321,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"undertake in my craft, in aught that may be made of iron or molten"
5322,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"electrum, whatever fire and air can do, cease thou to entreat as"
5323,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"doubtful of thy strength.' These words spoken, he clasped his wife in"
5324,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"the desired embrace, and, sinking in her lap, wooed quiet slumber to"
5325,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,overspread his limbs.
5326,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,
5327,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Thereon, so soon as sleep, now in mid-career of waning night, had given"
5328,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"rest and gone; soon as a woman, whose task is to sustain life with her"
5329,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"distaff and the slender labours of the loom, kindles the ashes of her"
5330,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"slumbering fire, her toil encroaching on the night, and sets a long task"
5331,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"of fire-lit spinning to her maidens, that so she may keep her husband's"
5332,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"bed unsullied and nourish her little children,--even so the Lord of"
5333,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Fire, nor slacker in his hours than she, rises from his soft couch to"
5334,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,the work of his smithy. An island rises by the side of Sicily and
5335,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Aeolian Lipare, steep with smoking cliffs, whereunder the vaulted and"
5336,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"thunderous Aetnean caverns are hollowed out for Cyclopean forges, the"
5337,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"strong strokes on the anvils echo in groans, ore of steel hisses in the"
5338,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"vaults, and the fire pants in the furnaces: the house of Vulcan, and"
5339,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,Vulcania the land's name. Hither now the Lord of Fire descends from
5340,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"heaven's height. In the vast cavern the Cyclopes were forging iron,"
5341,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,Brontes and Steropes and Pyracmon with bared limbs. Shaped in their
5342,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"hands was a thunderbolt, in part already polished, such as the Father of"
5343,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Heaven hurls down on earth in multitudes, part yet unfinished. Three"
5344,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"coils of frozen rain, three of watery mist they had enwrought in it,"
5345,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,three of ruddy fire and winged south wind; now they were mingling in
5346,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"their work the awful splendours, the sound and terror, and the"
5347,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,[432-469]angry pursuing flames. Elsewhere they hurried on a chariot for
5348,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Mars with flying wheels, wherewith he stirs up men and cities; and"
5349,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"burnished the golden serpent-scales of the awful aegis, the armour of"
5350,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"wrathful Pallas, and the entwined snakes on the breast of the goddess,"
5351,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,the Gorgon head with severed neck and rolling eyes. 'Away with all!' he
5352,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"cries: 'stop your tasks unfinished, Cyclopes of Aetna, and attend to"
5353,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"this; a warrior's armour must be made. Now must strength, now quickness"
5354,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"of hand be tried, now all our art lend her guidance. Fling off delay.'"
5355,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"He spoke no more; but they all bent rapidly to the work, allotting their"
5356,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"labours equally. Brass and ore of gold flow in streams, and wounding"
5357,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"steel is molten in the vast furnace. They shape a mighty shield, to"
5358,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"receive singly all the weapons of the Latins, and weld it sevenfold,"
5359,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"circle on circle. Some fill and empty the windy bellows of their blast,"
5360,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,some dip the hissing brass in the trough. They raise their arms mightily
5361,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"in responsive time, and turn the mass of metal about in the grasp of"
5362,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,their tongs.
5363,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,
5364,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"While the lord of Lemnos is busied thus in the borders of Aeolia,"
5365,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,Evander is roused from his low dwelling by the gracious daylight and the
5366,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"matin songs of birds from the eaves. The old man arises, and draws on"
5367,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"his body raiment, and ties the Tyrrhene shoe latchets about his feet;"
5368,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"then buckles to his side and shoulder his Tegeaean sword, and swathes"
5369,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,himself in a panther skin that droops upon his left. Therewithal two
5370,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"watch-dogs go before him from the high threshold, and accompany their"
5371,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,master's steps. The hero sought his guest Aeneas in the privacy of his
5372,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"dwelling, mindful of their talk and his promised bounty. Nor did Aeneas"
5373,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"fail to be astir with the dawn. With the one went his son Pallas,"
5374,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"with the other Achates. They meet and clasp hands, and, sitting down"
5375,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"within the house, at length enjoy unchecked converse. The King begins"
5376,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,thus: . . .
5377,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,
5378,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"[470-505]'Princely chief of the Teucrians, in whose lifetime I will"
5379,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"never allow the state or realm of Troy vanquished, our strength is scant"
5380,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,to succour in war for so great a name. On this side the Tuscan river
5381,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"shuts us in; on that the Rutulian drives us hard, and thunders in arms"
5382,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,about our walls. But I purpose to unite to thee mighty peoples and the
5383,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,camp of a wealthy realm; an unforeseen chance offers this for thy
5384,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,salvation. Fate summons thy approach. Not far from here stands fast
5385,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Agylla city, an ancient pile of stone, where of old the Lydian race,"
5386,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"eminent in war, settled on the Etruscan ridges. For many years it"
5387,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"flourished, till King Mezentius ruled it with insolent sway and armed"
5388,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"terror. Why should I relate the horrible murders, the savage deeds of"
5389,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,the monarch? May the gods keep them in store for himself and his line!
5390,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Nay, he would even link dead bodies to living, fitting hand to hand and"
5391,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"face to face (the torture!), and in the oozy foulness and corruption of"
5392,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,the dreadful embrace so slay them by a lingering death. But at last his
5393,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"citizens, outwearied by his mad excesses, surround him and his house in"
5394,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"arms, cut down his comrades, and hurl fire on his roof. Amid the"
5395,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,massacre he escaped to the refuge of Rutulian land and the armed defence
5396,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"of Turnus' friendship. So all Etruria hath risen in righteous fury, and"
5397,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,in immediate battle claim their king for punishment. Over these
5398,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"thousands will I make thee chief, O Aeneas; for their noisy ships crowd"
5399,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"all the shore, and they bid the standards advance, while the aged"
5400,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"diviner stays them with prophecies: ""O chosen men of Maeonia, flower and"
5401,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"strength of them, of old time, whom righteous anger urges on the enemy,"
5402,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"and Mezentius inflames with deserved wrath, to no Italian is it"
5403,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,permitted to hold this great nation in control: choose foreigners to
5404,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"lead you."" At that, terrified by the divine warning, the Etruscan lines"
5405,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,have encamped on the plain; Tarchon himself hath sent ambassadors to me
5406,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"with the crown [506-539]and sceptre of the kingdom, and offers the"
5407,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,royal attire will I but enter their camp and take the Tyrrhene realm.
5408,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"But old age, frozen to dulness, and exhausted with length of life,"
5409,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"denies me the load of empire, and my prowess is past its day. I would"
5410,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"urge it on my son, did not the mixture of blood by his Sabellian mother"
5411,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"make this half his native land. Thou, to whose years and race alike the"
5412,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"fates extend their favour, on whom fortune calls, enter thou in, a"
5413,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,leader supreme in bravery over Teucrians and Italians. Mine own Pallas
5414,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"likewise, our hope and comfort, I will send with thee; let him grow used"
5415,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"to endure warfare and the stern work of battle under thy teaching, to"
5416,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"regard thine actions, and from his earliest years look up to thee. To"
5417,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"him will I give two hundred Arcadian cavalry, the choice of our warlike"
5418,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"strength, and Pallas as many more to thee in his own name.'"
5419,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,
5420,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Scarce had he ended; Aeneas, son of Anchises, and trusty Achates gazed"
5421,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"with steadfast face, and, sad at heart, were revolving inly many a"
5422,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"labour, had not the Cytherean sent a sign from the clear sky. For"
5423,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"suddenly a flash and peal comes quivering from heaven, and all seemed in"
5424,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"a moment to totter, and the Tyrrhene trumpet-blast to roar along the"
5425,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,sky. They look up; again and yet again the heavy crash re-echoes. They
5426,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,see in the serene space of sky armour gleam red through a cloud in the
5427,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"clear air, and ring clashing out. The others stood in amaze; but the"
5428,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,Trojan hero knew the sound for the promise of his goddess mother; then
5429,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"he speaks: 'Ask not, O friend, ask not in any wise what fortune this"
5430,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,presage announces; it is I who am summoned of heaven. This sign the
5431,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"goddess who bore me foretold she would send if war assailed, and would"
5432,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,bring through the air to my succour armour from Vulcan's hands. . . .
5433,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Ah, what slaughter awaits the wretched Laurentines! what a price, O"
5434,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Turnus, wilt thou pay me! how many shields and helmets and brave bodies"
5435,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"of men shalt thou, [540-573]Lord Tiber, roll under thy waves! Let them"
5436,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,call for armed array and break the league!'
5437,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,
5438,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"These words uttered, he rises from the high seat, and first wakes with"
5439,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"fresh fire the slumbering altars of Hercules, and gladly draws nigh his"
5440,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,tutelar god of yesternight and the small deities of the household. Alike
5441,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Evander, and alike the men of Troy, offer up, as is right, choice sheep"
5442,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"of two years old. Thereafter he goes to the ships and revisits his crew,"
5443,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,of whose company he chooses the foremost in valour to attend him to war;
5444,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"the rest glide down the water and float idly with the descending stream,"
5445,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,to come with news to Ascanius of his father's state. They give horses to
5446,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,the Teucrians who seek the fields of Tyrrhenia; a chosen one is brought
5447,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"for Aeneas, housed in a tawny lion skin that glitters with claws of"
5448,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"gold. Rumour flies suddenly, spreading over the little town, that they"
5449,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,ride in haste to the courts of the Tyrrhene king. Mothers redouble their
5450,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"prayers in terror, as fear treads closer on peril and the likeness of"
5451,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"the War God looms larger in sight. Then Evander, clasping the hand of"
5452,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"his departing son, clings to him weeping inconsolably, and speaks thus:"
5453,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,
5454,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"'Oh, if Jupiter would restore me the years that are past, as I was when,"
5455,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"close under Praeneste, I cut down their foremost ranks and burned the"
5456,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,piled shields of the conquered! Then this right hand sent King Erulus
5457,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"down to hell, though to him at his birth his mother Feronia (awful to"
5458,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,tell) had given three lives and triple arms to wield; thrice must he be
5459,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,laid low in death; yet then this hand took all his lives and as often
5460,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"stripped him of his arms. Never should I now, O son, be severed from thy"
5461,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,dear embrace; never had the insolent sword of Mezentius on my borders
5462,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"dealt so many cruel deaths, widowed the city of so many citizens. But"
5463,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"you, O heavenly powers, and thou, Jupiter, Lord and Governor of Heaven,"
5464,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"have compassion, I pray, on [574-609]the Arcadian king, and hear a"
5465,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"father's prayers. If your deity and decrees keep my Pallas safe for me,"
5466,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"if I live that I may see him and meet him yet, I pray for life; any toil"
5467,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"soever I have patience to endure. But if, O Fortune, thou threatenest"
5468,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"some dread calamity, now, ah now, may I break off a cruel life, while"
5469,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"anxiety still wavers and expectation is in doubt, while thou, dear boy,"
5470,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"my one last delight, art yet clasped in my embrace; let no bitterer"
5471,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,message wound mine ear.' These words the father poured forth at the
5472,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,final parting; his servants bore him swooning within.
5473,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,
5474,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"And now the cavalry had issued from the open gates, Aeneas and trusty"
5475,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Achates among the foremost, then other of the Trojan princes, Pallas"
5476,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,conspicuous amid the column in scarf and inlaid armour; like the Morning
5477,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Star, when, newly washed in the ocean wave, he shews his holy face in"
5478,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"heaven, and melts the darkness away. Fearful mothers stand on the walls"
5479,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,and follow with their eyes the cloud of dust and the squadrons gleaming
5480,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"in brass. They, where the goal of their way lies nearest, bear through"
5481,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"the brushwood in armed array. Forming in column, they advance noisily,"
5482,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,and the horse hoof shakes the crumbling plain with four-footed
5483,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"trampling. There is a high grove by the cold river of Caere, widely"
5484,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,revered in ancestral awe; sheltering hills shut it in all about and
5485,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,girdle the woodland with their dark firs. Rumour is that the old
5486,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Pelasgians, who once long ago held the Latin borders, consecrated the"
5487,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"grove and its festal day to Silvanus, god of the tilth and flock. Not"
5488,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,far from it Tarchon and his Tyrrhenians were encamped in a protected
5489,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,place; and now from the hill-top the tents of all their army might be
5490,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,seen outspread on the fields. Lord Aeneas and his chosen warriors draw
5491,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,hither and refresh their weary horses and limbs.
5492,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,
5493,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"But Venus the white goddess drew nigh, bearing her gifts through the"
5494,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,clouds of heaven; and when she saw her [610-646]son withdrawn far apart
5495,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"in the valley's recess by the cold river, cast herself in his way, and"
5496,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,addressed him thus: 'Behold perfected the presents of my husband's
5497,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"promised craftsmanship: so shalt thou not shun, O my child, soon to"
5498,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,challenge the haughty Laurentines or fiery Turnus to battle.' The
5499,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Cytherean spoke, and sought her son's embrace, and laid the armour"
5500,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"glittering under an oak over against him. He, rejoicing in the"
5501,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"magnificence of the goddess' gift, cannot have his fill of turning his"
5502,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"eyes over it piece by piece, and admires and handles between his arms"
5503,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"the helmet, dread with plumes and spouting flame, as when a blue cloud"
5504,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,takes fire in the sunbeams and gleams afar; then the smooth greaves of
5505,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"electrum and refined gold, the spear, and the shield's ineffable design."
5506,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,There the Lord of Fire had fashioned the story of Italy and the triumphs
5507,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"of the Romans, not witless of prophecy or ignorant of the age to be;"
5508,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"there all the race of Ascanius' future seed, and their wars fought one"
5509,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,by one. Likewise had he fashioned the she-wolf couched after the birth
5510,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"in the green cave of Mars; round her teats the twin boys hung playing,"
5511,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"and fearlessly mouthed their foster-mother; she, with round neck bent"
5512,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"back, stroked them by turns and shaped their bodies with her tongue."
5513,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,Thereto not far from this he had set Rome and the lawless rape of the
5514,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,Sabines in the concourse of the theatre when the great Circensian games
5515,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"were celebrated, and a fresh war suddenly arising between the people of"
5516,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,Romulus and aged Tatius and austere Cures. Next these same kings laid
5517,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,down their mutual strife and stood armed before Jove's altar with cup in
5518,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"hand, and joined treaty over a slain sow. Not far from there four-horse"
5519,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"chariots driven apart had torn Mettus asunder (but thou, O Alban,"
5520,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"shouldst have kept by thy words!), and Tullus tore the flesh of the liar"
5521,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"through the forest, his splashed blood dripping from the briars."
5522,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Therewithal Porsena commanded [647-681]to admit the exiled Tarquin, and"
5523,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,held the city in the grasp of a strong blockade; the Aeneadae rushed on
5524,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,the sword for liberty. Him thou couldst espy like one who chafes and
5525,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"like one who threatens, because Cocles dared to tear down the bridge,"
5526,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"and Cloelia broke her bonds and swam the river. Highest of all Manlius,"
5527,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"warder of the Tarpeian fortress, stood with the temple behind him and"
5528,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,held the high Capitoline; and the thatch of Romulus' palace stood rough
5529,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"and fresh. And here the silver goose, fluttering in the gilded"
5530,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"colonnades, cried that the Gauls were there on the threshold. The Gauls"
5531,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"were there among the brushwood, hard on the fortress, secure in the"
5532,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,darkness and the dower of shadowy night. Their clustering locks are of
5533,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"gold, and of gold their attire; their striped cloaks glitter, and their"
5534,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,milk-white necks are entwined with gold. Two Alpine pikes sparkle in the
5535,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"hand of each, and long shields guard their bodies. Here he had embossed"
5536,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"the dancing Salii and the naked Luperci, the crests wreathed in wool,"
5537,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,and the sacred shields that fell from heaven; in cushioned cars the
5538,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,virtuous matrons led on their rites through the city. Far hence he adds
5539,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"the habitations of hell also, the high gates of Dis and the dooms of"
5540,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"guilt; and thee, O Catiline, clinging on the beetling rock, and"
5541,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"shuddering at the faces of the Furies; and far apart the good, and Cato"
5542,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,delivering them statutes. Amidst it all flows wide the likeness of the
5543,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"swelling sea, wrought in gold, though the foam surged gray upon blue"
5544,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"water; and round about dolphins, in shining silver, swept the seas with"
5545,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,their tails in circle as they cleft the tide. In the centre were visible
5546,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,the brazen war-fleets of Actium; thou mightest see all Leucate swarm in
5547,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"embattled array, and the waves gleam with gold. Here Caesar Augustus,"
5548,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"leading Italy to battle with Fathers and People, with gods of household"
5549,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"and of state, stands on the lofty stern; prosperous flames jet round his"
5550,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"brow, and his [682-715]ancestral star dawns overhead. Elsewhere"
5551,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Agrippa, with favouring winds and gods, proudly leads on his column; on"
5552,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"his brows glitters the prow-girt naval crown, the haughty emblazonment"
5553,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"of the war. Here Antonius with barbarian aid and motley arms, from the"
5554,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"conquered nations of the Dawn and the shore of the southern sea, carries"
5555,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"with him Egypt and the Eastern forces of utmost Bactra, and the shameful"
5556,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Egyptian woman goes as his consort. All at once rush on, and the whole"
5557,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,ocean is torn into foam by straining oars and triple-pointed prows. They
5558,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,steer to sea; one might think that the Cyclades were uptorn and floated
5559,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"on the main, or that lofty mountains clashed with mountains, so mightily"
5560,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,do their crews urge on the turreted ships. Flaming tow and the winged
5561,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,steel of darts shower thickly from their hands; the fields of ocean
5562,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,redden with fresh slaughter. Midmost the Queen calls on her squadron
5563,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"with the timbrel of her country, nor yet casts back a glance on the twin"
5564,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"snakes behind her. Howling Anubis, and gods monstrous and multitudinous,"
5565,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,level their arms against Neptune and Venus and against Minerva; Mars
5566,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"rages amid the havoc, graven in iron, and the Fatal Sisters hang aloft,"
5567,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"and Discord strides rejoicing with garment rent, and Bellona attends her"
5568,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"with blood-stained scourge. Looking thereon, Actian Apollo above drew"
5569,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"his bow; with the terror of it all Egypt and India, every Arab and"
5570,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Sabaean, turned back in flight. The Queen herself seemed to call the"
5571,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"winds and spread her sails, and even now let her sheets run slack. Her"
5572,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"the Lord of Fire had fashioned amid the carnage, wan with the shadow of"
5573,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"death, borne along by the waves and the north-west wind; and over"
5574,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"against her the vast bulk of mourning Nile, opening out his folds and"
5575,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,calling with all his raiment the conquered people into his blue lap and
5576,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,the coverture of his streams. But Caesar rode into the city of Rome in
5577,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"triple triumph, and dedicated his vowed [716-731]offering to the gods"
5578,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"to stand for ever, three hundred stately shrines all about the city. The"
5579,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,streets were loud with gladness and games and shouting. In all the
5580,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"temples was a band of matrons, in all were altars, and before the altars"
5581,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,slain steers strewed the ground. Himself he sits on the snowy threshold
5582,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"of Phoebus the bright, reviews the gifts of the nations and ranges them"
5583,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"on the haughty doors. The conquered tribes move in long line, diverse as"
5584,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"in tongue, so in fashion of dress and armour. Here Mulciber had designed"
5585,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"the Nomad race and the ungirt Africans, here the Leleges and Carians and"
5586,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"archer Gelonians. Euphrates went by now with smoother waves, and the"
5587,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"Morini utmost of men, and the hornÃ¨d Rhine, the untamed Dahae, and"
5588,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,Araxes chafing under his bridge.
5589,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,
5590,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"These things he admires on the shield of Vulcan, his mother's gift, and"
5591,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,"rejoicing in the portraiture of unknown history, lifts on his shoulder"
5592,THE EMBASSAGE TO EVANDER,the destined glories of his children.

5602,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"And while thus things pass far in the distance, Juno daughter of Saturn"
5603,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"sent Iris down the sky to gallant Turnus, then haply seated in his"
5604,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,forefather Pilumnus' holy forest dell. To him the child of Thaumas spoke
5605,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,thus with roseate lips:
5606,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
5607,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"'Turnus, what no god had dared promise to thy prayer, behold, is brought"
5608,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,unasked by the circling day. Aeneas hath quitted town and comrades and
5609,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,fleet to seek Evander's throne and Palatine dwelling-place. Nor is it
5610,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"enough; he hath pierced to Corythus' utmost cities, and is mustering in"
5611,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"arms a troop of Lydian rustics. Why hesitate? now, now is the time to"
5612,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,call for chariot and horses. Break through all hindrance and seize the
5613,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,bewildered camp.'
5614,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
5615,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"She spoke, and rose into the sky on poised wings, and flashed under the"
5616,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"clouds in a long flying bow. He knew her, and lifting either hand to"
5617,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"heaven, with this cry pursued her flight: 'Iris, grace of the sky, who"
5618,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,hath driven thee down the clouds to me and borne thee to earth? Whence
5619,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"is this sudden sheen of weather? I see the sky parting asunder, and the"
5620,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"wandering stars in the firmament. I follow the high omen, whoso thou art"
5621,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"that callest me to arms.' And with these words he drew nigh the wave,"
5622,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"and [23-58]caught up water from its brimming eddy, making many prayers"
5623,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,to the gods and burdening the air with vows.
5624,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
5625,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"And now all the army was advancing on the open plain, rich in horses,"
5626,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"rich in raiment of broidered gold. Messapus rules the foremost ranks,"
5627,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,the sons of Tyrrheus the rear. Turnus commands the centre: even as
5628,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Ganges rising high in silence when his seven streams are still, or the"
5629,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"rich flood of Nile when he ebbs from the plains, and is now sunk into"
5630,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,his channel. On this the Teucrians descry a sudden cloud of dark dust
5631,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"gathering, and the blackness rising on the plain. CaÃ¯cus raises a cry"
5632,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"from the mound in front: 'What mass of misty gloom, O citizens, is"
5633,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"rolling hitherward? to arms in haste! serve out weapons, climb the"
5634,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"walls. The enemy approaches, ho!' With mighty clamour the Teucrians pour"
5635,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,in through all the gates and fill the works. For so at his departure
5636,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Aeneas the great captain had enjoined; were aught to chance meanwhile,"
5637,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"they should not venture to range their line or trust the plain, but keep"
5638,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"their camp and the safety of the entrenched walls. So, though shame and"
5639,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"wrath beckon them on to battle, they yet bar the gates and do his"
5640,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"bidding, and await the foe armed and in shelter of the towers. Turnus,"
5641,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"who had flown forward in advance of his tardy column, comes up suddenly"
5642,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"to the town with a train of twenty chosen cavalry, borne on a Thracian"
5643,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"horse dappled with white, and covered by a golden helmet with scarlet"
5644,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"plume. 'Who will be with me, my men, to be first on the foe? See!' he"
5645,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"cries; and sends a javelin spinning into the air to open battle, and"
5646,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"advances towering on the plain. His comrades take up the cry, and follow"
5647,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"with dreadful din, wondering at the Teucrians' coward hearts, that they"
5648,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"issue not on even field nor face them in arms, but keep in shelter of"
5649,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"the camp. Hither and thither he rides furiously, tracing the walls, and"
5650,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,seeking entrance where way is none. And as a wolf prowling [59-92]about
5651,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"some crowded sheepfold, when, beaten sore of winds and rains, he howls"
5652,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,at the pens by midnight; safe beneath their mothers the lambs keep
5653,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"bleating on; he, savage and insatiate, rages in anger against the flock"
5654,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"he cannot reach, tired by the long-gathering madness for food, and the"
5655,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"throat unslaked with blood: even so the Rutulian, as he gazes on the"
5656,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"walled camp, kindles in anger, and indignation is hot in his iron frame."
5657,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,By what means may he essay entrance? by what passage hurl the imprisoned
5658,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,Trojans from the rampart and fling them on the plain? Close under the
5659,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"flanking camp lay the fleet, fenced about with mounds and the waters of"
5660,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"the river; it he attacks, and calls for fire to his exultant comrades,"
5661,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,and eagerly catches a blazing pine-torch in his hand. Then indeed they
5662,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"press on, quickened by Turnus' presence, and all the band arm them with"
5663,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,black faggots. The hearth-fires are plundered; the smoky brand trails a
5664,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"resinous glare, and the Fire-god sends clouds of glowing ashes upward."
5665,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
5666,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"What god, O Muses, guarded the Trojans from the rage of the fire? who"
5667,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,repelled the fierce flame from their ships? Tell it; ancient is the
5668,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"assurance thereof, but the fame everlasting. What time Aeneas began to"
5669,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"shape his fleet on Phrygian Ida, and prepared to seek the high seas, the"
5670,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Berecyntian, they say, the very Mother of gods, spoke to high Jove in"
5671,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"these words: 'Grant, O son, to my prayer, what her dearness claims who"
5672,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,bore thee and laid Olympus under thy feet. My pine forest beloved of me
5673,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"these many years, my grove was on the mountain's crown, whither men bore"
5674,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"my holy things, dim with dusky pine and pillared maples. These, when he"
5675,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"required a fleet, I gave gladly to the Dardanian; now fear wrings me"
5676,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"with sharp distress. Relieve my terrors, and grant a mother's prayers"
5677,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,such power that they may yield to no stress of voyaging or of stormy
5678,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,gust: be birth on our hills their avail.'
5679,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
5680,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"[93-126]Thus her son in answer, who wheels the starry worlds: 'O"
5681,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"mother, whither callest thou fate? or what dost thou seek for these of"
5682,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,thine? May hulls have the right of immortality that were fashioned by
5683,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,mortal hand? and may Aeneas traverse perils secure in insecurity? To
5684,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"what god is power so great given? Nay, but when, their duty done, they"
5685,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"shall lie at last in their Ausonian haven, from all that have outgone"
5686,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"the waves and borne their Dardanian captain to the fields of Laurentum,"
5687,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"will I take their mortal body, and bid them be goddesses of the mighty"
5688,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"deep, even as Doto the NereÃ¯d and Galatea, when they cut the sea that"
5689,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,falls away from their breasts in foam.' He ended; and by his brother's
5690,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Stygian streams, by the banks of the pitchy black-boiling chasm he"
5691,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"nodded confirmation, and shook all Olympus with his nod."
5692,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
5693,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"So the promised day was come, and the destinies had fulfilled their due"
5694,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"time, when Turnus' injury stirred the Mother to ward the brands from her"
5695,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"holy ships. First then a strange light flashed on all eyes, and a great"
5696,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"glory from the Dawn seemed to dart over the sky, with the choirs of Ida;"
5697,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"then an awful voice fell through air, filling the Trojan and Rutulian"
5698,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"ranks: 'Disquiet not yourselves, O Teucrians, to guard ships of mine,"
5699,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,neither arm your hands: sooner shall Turnus burn the seas than these
5700,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"holy pines. You, go free; go, goddesses of the sea; the Mother bids it.'"
5701,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"And immediately each ship breaks the bond that held it, as with dipping"
5702,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,prows they plunge like dolphins deep into the water: from it again (O
5703,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"wonderful and strange!) they rise with maidens' faces in like number,"
5704,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,and bear out to sea.
5705,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
5706,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,The Rutulians stood dumb: Messapus himself is terror-stricken among his
5707,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"disordered cavalry; even the stream of Tiber pauses with hoarse murmur,"
5708,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,and recoils from sea. But bold Turnus fails not a whit in confidence;
5709,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"nay, he [127-158]raises their courage with words, nay, he chides them:"
5710,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,'On the Trojans are these portents aimed; Jupiter himself hath bereft
5711,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,them of their wonted succour; nor do they abide Rutulian sword and fire.
5712,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"So are the seas pathless for the Teucrians, nor is there any hope in"
5713,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,flight; they have lost half their world. And we hold the land: in all
5714,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,their thousands the nations of Italy are under arms. In no wise am I
5715,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,dismayed by those divine oracles of doom the Phrygians insolently
5716,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"advance. Fate and Venus are satisfied, in that the Trojans have touched"
5717,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"our fruitful Ausonian fields. I too have my fate in reply to theirs, to"
5718,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,put utterly to the sword the guilty nation who have robbed me of my
5719,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"bride; not the sons of Atreus alone are touched by that pain, nor may"
5720,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,Mycenae only rise in arms. But to have perished once is enough! To have
5721,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"sinned once should have been enough, in all but utter hatred of the"
5722,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"whole of womankind. Trust in the sundering rampart, and the hindrance of"
5723,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"their trenches, so little between them and death, gives these their"
5724,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"courage: yet have they not seen Troy town, the work of Neptune's hand,"
5725,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"sink into fire? But you, my chosen, who of you makes ready to breach"
5726,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"their palisade at the sword's point, and join my attack on their"
5727,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"fluttered camp? I have no need of Vulcanian arms, of a thousand ships,"
5728,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,to meet the Teucrians. All Etruria may join on with them in alliance:
5729,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"nor let them fear the darkness, and the cowardly theft of their"
5730,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Palladium, and the guards cut down on the fortress height. Nor will we"
5731,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,hide ourselves unseen in a horse's belly; in daylight and unconcealed
5732,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,are we resolved to girdle their walls with flame. Not with Grecians will
5733,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"I make them think they have to do, nor a Pelasgic force kept off till"
5734,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"the tenth year by Hector. Now, since the better part of day is spent,"
5735,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"for what remains refresh your bodies, glad that we have done so well,"
5736,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,and expect the order of battle.'
5737,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
5738,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,[159-192]Meanwhile charge is given to Messapus to blockade the gates
5739,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"with pickets of sentries, and encircle the works with watchfires. Twice"
5740,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,seven are chosen to guard the walls with Rutulian soldiery; but each
5741,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"leads an hundred men, crimson-plumed and sparkling in gold. They spread"
5742,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"themselves about and keep alternate watch, and, lying along the grass,"
5743,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"drink deep and set brazen bowls atilt. The fires glow, and the sentinels"
5744,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,spend the night awake in games. . . .
5745,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
5746,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Down on this the Trojans look forth from the rampart, as they hold the"
5747,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,height in arms; withal in fearful haste they try the gates and lay
5748,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"gangways from bastion to bastion, and bring up missiles. Mnestheus and"
5749,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"valiant Serestus speed the work, whom lord Aeneas appointed, should"
5750,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"misfortune call, to be rulers of the people and governors of the state."
5751,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"All their battalions, sharing the lot of peril, keep watch along the"
5752,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"walls, and take alternate charge of all that requires defence."
5753,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
5754,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"On guard at the gate was Nisus son of Hyrtacus, most valiant in arms,"
5755,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,whom Ida the huntress had sent in Aeneas' company with fleet javelin and
5756,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"light arrows; and by his side Euryalus, fairest of all the Aeneadae and"
5757,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"the wearers of Trojan arms, showing on his unshaven boy's face the first"
5758,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"bloom of youth. These two were one in affection, and charged in battle"
5759,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,together; now likewise their common guard kept the gate. Nisus cries:
5760,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"'Lend the gods this fervour to the soul, Euryalus? or does fatal passion"
5761,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,become a proper god to each? Long ere now my soul is restless to begin
5762,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"some great deed of arms, and quiet peace delights it not. Thou seest how"
5763,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,confident in fortune the Rutulians stand. Their lights glimmer far
5764,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,apart; buried in drunken sleep they have sunk to rest; silence stretches
5765,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"all about. Learn then what doubt, what purpose, now rises in my spirit."
5766,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"People and senate, they all cry that Aeneas [193-226]be summoned, and"
5767,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,men be sent to carry him tidings. If they promise what I ask in thy
5768,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,name--for to me the glory of the deed is enough--methinks I can find
5769,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,beneath yonder hillock a path to the walls of Pallanteum town.'
5770,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
5771,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Euryalus stood fixed, struck through with high ambition, and therewith"
5772,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"speaks thus to his fervid friend: 'Dost thou shun me then, Nisus, to"
5773,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,share thy company in highest deeds? shall I send thee alone into so
5774,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,great perils? Not thus did my warrior father Opheltes rear and nurture
5775,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"me amid the Argive terror and the agony of Troy, nor thus have I borne"
5776,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,myself by thy side while following noble Aeneas to his utmost fate. Here
5777,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"is a spirit, yes here, that scorns the light of day, that deems lightly"
5778,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,bought at a life's price that honour to which thou dost aspire.'
5779,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
5780,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"To this Nisus: 'Assuredly I had no such fear of thee; no, nor could I;"
5781,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"so may great Jupiter, or whoso looks on earth with equal eyes, restore"
5782,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,me to thee triumphant. But if haply--as thou seest often and often in so
5783,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"forlorn a hope--if haply chance or deity sweep me to adverse doom, I"
5784,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,would have thee survive; thine age is worthier to live. Be there one to
5785,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"commit me duly to earth, rescued or ransomed from the battlefield: or,"
5786,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"if fortune deny that, to pay me far away the rites of funeral and the"
5787,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"grace of a tomb. Neither would I bring such pain on thy poor mother, she"
5788,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"who singly of many matrons hath dared to follow her boy to the end, and"
5789,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,slights great Acestes' city.'
5790,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
5791,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,And he: 'In vain dost thou string idle reasons; nor does my purpose
5792,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"yield or change its place so soon. Let us make haste.' He speaks, and"
5793,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"rouses the watch; they come up, and relieve the guard; quitting their"
5794,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"post, he and Nisus stride on to seek the prince."
5795,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
5796,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,The rest of living things over all lands were soothing their cares in
5797,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"sleep, and their hearts forgot their pain; the foremost Trojan captains,"
5798,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"a chosen band, held council [227-261]of state upon the kingdom; what"
5799,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"should they do, or who would now be their messenger to Aeneas? They"
5800,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"stand, leaning on their long spears and grasping their shields, in mid"
5801,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,level of the camp. Then Nisus and Euryalus together pray with quick
5802,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,urgency to be given audience; their matter is weighty and will be worth
5803,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"the delay. IÃ¼lus at once heard their hurried plea, and bade Nisus speak."
5804,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Thereon the son of Hyrtacus: 'Hear, O people of Aeneas, with favourable"
5805,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"mind, nor regard our years in what we offer. Sunk in sleep and wine, the"
5806,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,Rutulians are silent; we have stealthily spied the open ground that lies
5807,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"in the path through the gate next the sea. The line of fires is broken,"
5808,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,and their smoke rises darkly upwards. If you allow us to use the chance
5809,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"towards seeking Aeneas in Pallanteum town, you will soon descry us here"
5810,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,at hand with the spoils of the great slaughter we have dealt. Nor shall
5811,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,we miss the way we go; up the dim valleys we have seen the skirts of the
5812,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"town, and learned all the river in continual hunting.'"
5813,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
5814,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Thereon aged Aletes, sage in counsel: 'Gods of our fathers, under whose"
5815,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"deity Troy ever stands, not wholly yet do you purpose to blot out the"
5816,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Trojan race, when you have brought us young honour and hearts so sure as"
5817,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"this.' So speaking, he caught both by shoulder and hand, with tears"
5818,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,showering down over face and feature. 'What guerdon shall I deem may be
5819,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"given you, O men, what recompense for these noble deeds? First and"
5820,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,fairest shall be your reward from the gods and your own conduct; and
5821,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Aeneas the good shall speedily repay the rest, and Ascanius' fresh youth"
5822,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"never forget so great a service.'--'Nay,' breaks in Ascanius, 'I whose"
5823,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"sole safety is in my father's return, I adjure thee and him, O Nisus, by"
5824,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"our great household gods, by the tutelar spirit of Assaracus and hoar"
5825,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,Vesta's sanctuary--on your knees I lay all my fortune and trust--recall
5826,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,my father; [262-296]give him back to sight; all sorrow disappears in
5827,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,his recovery. I will give a pair of cups my father took in vanquished
5828,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Arisba, wrought in silver and rough with tracery, twin tripods, and two"
5829,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"large talents of gold, and an ancient bowl of Sidonian Dido's giving. If"
5830,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"it be indeed our lot to possess Italy and grasp a conquering sceptre,"
5831,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,and to assign the spoil; thou sawest the horse and armour of Turnus as
5832,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"he went all in gold; that same horse, the shield and the ruddy plume,"
5833,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"will I reserve from partition, thy reward, O Nisus, even from now. My"
5834,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"father will give besides twelve mothers of the choicest beauty, and men"
5835,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"captives, all in their due array; above these, the space of meadow-land"
5836,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"that is now King Latinus' own domain. Thee, O noble boy, whom mine age"
5837,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"follows at a nearer interval, even now I welcome to all my heart, and"
5838,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,embrace as my companion in every fortune. No glory shall be sought for
5839,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"my state without thee; whether peace or war be in conduct, my chiefest"
5840,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,trust for deed and word shall be in thee.'
5841,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
5842,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,Answering whom Euryalus speaks thus: 'Let but the day never come to
5843,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,prove me degenerate from this daring valour; fortune may fall prosperous
5844,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"or adverse. But above all thy gifts, one thing I ask of thee. My poor"
5845,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"mother of Priam's ancient race, whom neither the Ilian land nor King"
5846,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Acestes' city kept from following me forth, her I now leave in ignorance"
5847,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"of this danger, such as it is, and without a farewell, because--night"
5848,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"and thine hand be witness!--I cannot bear a parent's tears. But thou, I"
5849,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"pray, support her want and relieve her loneliness. Let me take with me"
5850,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"this hope in thee, I shall go more daringly to every fortune.' Deeply"
5851,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"stirred at heart, the Dardanians shed tears, fair IÃ¼lus before them all,"
5852,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,as the likeness of his own father's love wrung his soul. Then he speaks
5853,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,thus: . . . 'Assure thyself all that is due to thy mighty enterprise;
5854,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"[297-330]for she shall be a mother to me, and only in name fail to be"
5855,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,CreÃ¼sa; nor slight is the honour reserved for the mother of such a son.
5856,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"What chance soever follow this deed, I swear by this head whereby my"
5857,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"father was wont to swear, what I promise to thee on thy prosperous"
5858,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,return shall abide the same for thy mother and kindred.' So speaks he
5859,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"weeping, and ungirds from his shoulder the sword inlaid with gold,"
5860,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,fashioned with marvellous skill by Lycaon of Gnosus and fitly set in a
5861,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,sheath of ivory. Mnestheus gives Nisus the shaggy spoils of a lion's
5862,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"hide; faithful Aletes exchanges his helmet. They advance onward in arms,"
5863,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"and as they go all the company of captains, young and old, speed them to"
5864,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"the gates with vows. Likewise fair IÃ¼lus, with a man's thought and a"
5865,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"spirit beyond his years, gave many messages to be carried to his father."
5866,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,But the breezes shred all asunder and give them unaccomplished to the
5867,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,clouds.
5868,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
5869,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"They issue and cross the trenches, and through the shadow of night seek"
5870,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"the fatal camp, themselves first to be the death of many a man. All"
5871,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"about they see bodies strewn along the grass in drunken sleep, chariots"
5872,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"atilt on the shore, the men lying among their traces and wheels, with"
5873,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"their armour by them, and their wine. The son of Hyrtacus began thus:"
5874,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"'Euryalus, now for daring hands; all invites them; here lies our way;"
5875,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"see thou that none raise a hand from behind against us, and keep"
5876,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"far-sighted watch. Here will I deal desolation, and make a broad path"
5877,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,for thee to follow.' So speaks he and checks his voice; therewith he
5878,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"drives his sword at lordly Rhamnes, who haply on carpets heaped high was"
5879,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"drawing the full breath of sleep; a king himself, and King Turnus'"
5880,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"best-beloved augur, but not all his augury could avert his doom. Three"
5881,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"of his household beside him, lying carelessly among their arms, and the"
5882,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"armour-bearer and charioteer of Remus go [331-364]down before him,"
5883,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,caught at the horses' feet. Their drooping necks he severs with the
5884,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"sword, then beheads their lord likewise and leaves the trunk spouting"
5885,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,blood; the dark warm gore soaks ground and cushions. Therewithal Lamyrus
5886,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"and Lamus, and beautiful young Serranus, who that night had played long"
5887,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"and late, and lay with the conquering god heavy on every limb; happy,"
5888,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"had he played out the night, and carried his game to day! Even thus an"
5889,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"unfed lion riots through full sheepfolds, for the madness of hunger"
5890,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"urges him, and champs and rends the fleecy flock that are dumb with"
5891,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"fear, and roars with blood-stained mouth. Nor less is the slaughter of"
5892,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,Euryalus; he too rages all aflame; an unnamed multitude go down before
5893,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"his path, and Fadus and Herbesus and Rhoetus and Abaris, unaware;"
5894,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Rhoetus awake and seeing all, but he hid in fear behind a great bowl;"
5895,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"right in whose breast, as he rose close by, he plunged the sword all its"
5896,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"length, and drew it back heavy with death. He vomits forth the crimson"
5897,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"life-blood, and throws up wine mixed with blood in the death agony. The"
5898,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"other presses hotly on his stealthy errand, and now bent his way towards"
5899,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Messapus' comrades, where he saw the last flicker of the fires go down,"
5900,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,and the horses tethered in order cropping the grass; when Nisus briefly
5901,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"speaks thus, for he saw him carried away by excess of murderous desire;"
5902,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,'Let us stop; for unfriendly daylight draws nigh. Vengeance is sated to
5903,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"the full; a path is cut through the enemy.' Much they leave behind,"
5904,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"men's armour wrought in solid silver, and bowls therewith, and beautiful"
5905,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,carpets. Euryalus tears away the decorations of Rhamnes and his
5906,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"sword-belt embossed with gold, a gift which Caedicus, wealthiest of men"
5907,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"of old, sends to Remulus of Tibur when plighting friendship far away; he"
5908,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,on his death-bed gives them to his grandson for his own; after his death
5909,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,the Rutulians captured them as spoil of war; these he fits on the
5910,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"shoulders valiant [365-396]in vain, then puts on Messapus' light helmet"
5911,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,with its graceful plumes. They issue from the camp and make for safety.
5912,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
5913,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,Meanwhile an advanced guard of cavalry were on their way from the Latin
5914,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"city, while the rest of their marshalled battalions linger on the"
5915,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"plains, and bore a reply to King Turnus; three hundred men all under"
5916,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"shield, in Volscens' leading. And now they approached the camp and drew"
5917,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"near the wall, when they descry the two turning away by the pathway to"
5918,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,the left; and in the glimmering darkness of night the forgotten helmet
5919,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"betrayed Euryalus, glittering as it met the light. It seemed no thing of"
5920,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"chance. Volscens cries aloud from his column: 'Stand, men! why on the"
5921,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"march, or how are you in arms? or whither hold you your way?' They offer"
5922,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"nothing in reply, but quicken their flight into the forest, and throw"
5923,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,themselves on the night. On this side and that the horsemen bar the
5924,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"familiar crossways, and encircle every outlet with sentinels. The forest"
5925,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,spread wide in tangled thickets and dark ilex; thick growth of briars
5926,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"choked it all about, and the muffled pathway glimmered in a broken"
5927,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"track. Hampered by the shadowy boughs and his cumbrous spoil, Euryalus"
5928,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,in his fright misses the line of way. Nisus gets clear; and now
5929,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"unthinkingly he had passed the enemy, and the place afterwards called"
5930,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,Albani from Alba's name; then the deep coverts were of King Latinus'
5931,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"domain; when he stopped, and looked back in vain for his lost friend."
5932,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"'Euryalus, unhappy! on what ground have I left thee? or where shall I"
5933,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"follow, again unwinding all the entanglement of the treacherous woodland"
5934,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"way?' Therewith he marks and retraces his footsteps, and wanders down"
5935,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"the silent thickets. He hears the horses, hears the clatter and"
5936,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"signal-notes of the pursuers. Nor had he long to wait, when shouts reach"
5937,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"his ears, and he sees Euryalus, whom even now, in the perplexity of"
5938,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"ground and [397-431]darkness, the whole squadron have borne down in a"
5939,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"sudden rush, and seize in spite of all his vain struggles. What shall he"
5940,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"do? with what force, what arms dare his rescue? or shall he rush on his"
5941,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"doom amid their swords, and find in their wounds a speedy and glorious"
5942,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"death? Quickly he draws back his arm with poised spear, and looking up"
5943,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"to the moon on high, utters this prayer: 'Do thou give present aid to"
5944,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"our enterprise, O Latonian goddess, glory of the stars and guardian of"
5945,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,the woodlands: by all the gifts my father Hyrtacus ever bore for my sake
5946,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"to thine altars, by all mine own hand hath added from my hunting, or"
5947,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"hung in thy dome, or fixed on thy holy roof, grant me to confound these"
5948,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"masses, and guide my javelin through the air.' He ended, and with all"
5949,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,the force of his body hurls the steel. The flying spear whistles through
5950,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"the darkness of the night, and comes full on the shield of Sulmo, and"
5951,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"there snaps, and the broken shaft passes on through his heart. Spouting"
5952,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"a warm tide from his breast he rolls over chill in death, and his sides"
5953,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"throb with long-drawn gasps. Hither and thither they gaze round. Lo, he"
5954,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,all the fiercer was poising another weapon high by his ear; while they
5955,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"hesitate, the spear went whizzing through both Tagus' temples, and"
5956,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"pierced and stuck fast in the warm brain. Volscens is mad with rage, and"
5957,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"nowhere espies the sender of the weapon, nor where to direct his fury."
5958,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"'Yet meanwhile thy warm blood shalt pay me vengeance for both,' he"
5959,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"cries; and unsheathing his sword, he made at Euryalus. Then indeed"
5960,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,frantic with terror Nisus shrieks out; no longer could he shroud himself
5961,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"in darkness or endure such agony. 'On me, on me, I am here, I did it, on"
5962,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"me turn your steel, O Rutulians! Mine is all the guilt; he dared not,"
5963,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"no, nor could not; to this heaven I appeal and the stars that know; he"
5964,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,only loved his hapless friend too well.' Such words he was uttering; but
5965,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,the sword driven hard home is gone [432-464]clean through his ribs and
5966,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"pierces the white breast. Euryalus rolls over in death, and the blood"
5967,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"runs over his lovely limbs, and his neck sinks and settles on his"
5968,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,shoulder; even as when a lustrous flower cut away by the plough droops
5969,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"in death, or weary-necked poppies bow down their head if overweighted"
5970,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"with a random shower. But Nisus rushes amidst them, and alone among them"
5971,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"all makes at Volscens, keeps to Volscens alone: round him the foe"
5972,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"cluster, and on this side and that hurl him back: none the less he"
5973,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"presses on, and whirls his sword like lightning, till he plunges it full"
5974,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"in the face of the shrieking Rutulian, and slays his enemy as he dies."
5975,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Then, stabbed through and through, he flung himself above his lifeless"
5976,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"friend, and there at last found the quiet sleep of death."
5977,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
5978,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Happy pair! if my verse is aught of avail, no length of days shall ever"
5979,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"blot you from the memory of time, while the house of Aeneas shall dwell"
5980,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"by the Capitoline's stedfast stone, and the lord of Rome hold"
5981,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,sovereignty.
5982,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
5983,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"The victorious Rutulians, with their spoils and the plunder regained,"
5984,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,bore dead Volscens weeping to the camp. Nor in the camp was the wailing
5985,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"less, when Rhamnes was found a bloodless corpse, and Serranus and Numa"
5986,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,and all their princes destroyed in a single slaughter. Crowds throng
5987,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"towards the corpses and the men wounded to death, the ground fresh with"
5988,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,warm slaughter and the swoln runlets of frothing blood. They mutually
5989,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"recognise the spoils, Messapus' shining helmet and the decorations that"
5990,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,cost such sweat to win back.
5991,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
5992,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"And now Dawn, leaving the saffron bed of Tithonus, scattered over earth"
5993,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"her fresh shafts of early light; now the sunlight streams in, now"
5994,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"daylight unveils the world. Turnus, himself fully armed, awakes his men"
5995,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"to arms, and each leader marshals to battle his brazen lines and whets"
5996,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"their ardour with varying rumours. Nay, pitiable sight! they"
5997,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,[465-499]fix on spear-points and uprear and follow with loud shouts the
5998,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"heads of Euryalus and Nisus. . . . The Aeneadae stubbornly face them,"
5999,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"lining the left hand wall (for their right is girdled by the river),"
6000,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"hold the deep trenches and stand gloomily on the high towers, stirred"
6001,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"withal by the faces they know, alas, too well, in their dark dripping"
6002,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,gore. Meanwhile Rumour on fluttering wings rushes with the news through
6003,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,the alarmed town and glides to the ears of Euryalus' mother. But
6004,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"instantly the warmth leaves her woeful body, the shuttle starts from her"
6005,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"hand and the threads unroll. She darts forth in agony, and with woman's"
6006,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,wailing and torn hair runs distractedly towards the walls and the
6007,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"foremost columns, recking naught of men, naught of peril or weapons;"
6008,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"thereon she fills the air with her complaint: 'Is it thus I behold thee,"
6009,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"O Euryalus? Couldst thou, the latest solace of mine age, leave me alone"
6010,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,so cruelly? nor when sent into such danger was one last word of thee
6011,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"allowed thine unhappy mother? Alas, thou liest in a strange land, given"
6012,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"for a prey to the dogs and fowls of Latium! nor was I, thy mother, there"
6013,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"for chief mourner, to lay thee out or close thine eyes or wash thy"
6014,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"wounds, and cover thee with the garment I hastened on for thee whole"
6015,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"nights and days, an anxious old woman taking comfort from the loom."
6016,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Whither shall I follow? or what land now holds thy mangled corpse, thy"
6017,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,body torn limb from limb? Is this all of what thou wert that returns to
6018,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"me, O my son? is it this I have followed by land and sea? Strike me"
6019,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"through of your pity, on me cast all your weapons, Rutulians; make me"
6020,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"the first sacrifice of your steel. Or do thou, mighty lord of heaven, be"
6021,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"merciful, and with thine own weapon hurl this hateful life to the nether"
6022,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"deep, since in no wise else may I break away from life's cruelty.' At"
6023,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"this weeping cry their courage falters, and a sigh of sorrow passes all"
6024,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"along; their strength is benumbed and broken for battle. Her, while"
6025,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"[500-535]her grief kindled, at Ilioneus' and weeping IÃ¼lus' bidding"
6026,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,Idaeus and Actor catch up and carry home in their arms.
6027,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
6028,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,But the terrible trumpet-note afar rang on the shrill brass; a shout
6029,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"follows, and is echoed from the sky. The Volscians hasten up in even"
6030,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"line under their advancing roof of shields, and set to fill up the"
6031,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,trenches and tear down the palisades. Some seek entrance by scaling the
6032,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"walls with ladders, where the defenders' battle-line is thin, and light"
6033,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,shows through gaps in the ring of men. The Teucrians in return shower
6034,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"weapons of every sort, and push them down with stiff poles, practised by"
6035,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"long warfare in their ramparts' defence: and fiercely hurl heavy stones,"
6036,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"so be they may break the shielded line; while they, crowded under their"
6037,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"shell, lightly bear all the downpour. But now they fail; for where the"
6038,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"vast mass presses close, the Teucrians roll a huge block tumbling down"
6039,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,that makes a wide gap in the Rutulians and crashes through their
6040,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,armour-plating. Nor do the bold Rutulians care longer to continue the
6041,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"blind fight, but strive to clear the rampart with missiles. . . ."
6042,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,Elsewhere in dreadful guise Mezentius brandishes his Etruscan pine and
6043,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"hurls smoking brands; but Messapus, tamer of horses, seed of Neptune,"
6044,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,tears away the palisading and calls for ladders to the ramparts.
6045,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
6046,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Thy sisterhood, O Calliope, I pray inspire me while I sing the"
6047,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"destruction spread then and there by Turnus' sword, the deaths dealt"
6048,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"from his hand, and whom each warrior sent down to the under world; and"
6049,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,unroll with me the broad borders of war.
6050,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
6051,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,A tower loomed vast with lofty gangways at a point of vantage; this all
6052,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"the Italians strove with main strength to storm, and set all their might"
6053,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,and device to overthrow it; the Trojans in return defended it with
6054,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"stones and hurled showers of darts through the loopholes. Turnus,"
6055,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"leading the attack, threw a blazing torch that caught flaming on the"
6056,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"[536-570]side wall; swoln by the wind, the flame seized the planking"
6057,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"and clung devouring to the standards. Those within, in hurry and"
6058,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"confusion, desire retreat from their distress; in vain; while they"
6059,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"cluster together and fall back to the side free from the destroyer, the"
6060,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,tower sinks prone under the sudden weight with a crash that thunders
6061,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"through all the sky. Pierced by their own weapons, and impaled on hard"
6062,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"splinters of wood, they come half slain to the ground with the vast mass"
6063,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,behind them. Scarcely do Helenor alone and Lycus struggle out; Helenor
6064,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"in his early prime, whom a slave woman of Licymnos bore in secret to the"
6065,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Maeonian king, and sent to Troy in forbidden weapons, lightly armed with"
6066,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"sheathless sword and white unemblazoned shield. And he, when he saw"
6067,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"himself among Turnus' encircling thousands, ranks on this side and ranks"
6068,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"on this of Latins, as a wild beast which, girt with a crowded ring of"
6069,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"hunters, dashes at their weapons, hurls herself unblinded on death, and"
6070,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,comes with a bound upon the spears; even so he rushes to his death amid
6071,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"the enemy, and presses on where he sees their weapons thickest. But"
6072,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Lycus, far fleeter of foot, holds by the walls in flight midway among"
6073,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"foes and arms, and strives to catch the coping in his grasp and reach"
6074,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"the hands of his comrades. And Turnus pursuing and aiming as he ran,"
6075,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"thus upbraids him in triumph: 'Didst thou hope, madman, thou mightest"
6076,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"escape our hands?' and catches him as he clings, and tears him and a"
6077,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"great piece of the wall away: as when, with a hare or snowy-bodied swan"
6078,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"in his crooked talons, Jove's armour-bearer soars aloft, or the wolf of"
6079,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,Mars snatches from the folds some lamb sought of his mother with
6080,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,incessant bleating. On all sides a shout goes up. They advance and fill
6081,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,the trenches with heaps of earth; some toss glowing brands on the roofs.
6082,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,Ilioneus strikes down Lucetius with a great fragment of mountain rock
6083,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"as, carrying fire, he draws [571-606]nigh the gate. Liger slays"
6084,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Emathion, Asylas Corinaeus, the one skilled with the javelin, the other"
6085,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,with the stealthy arrow from afar. Caeneus slays Ortygius; Turnus
6086,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"victorious Caeneus; Turnus Itys and Clonius, Dioxippus, and Promolus,"
6087,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"and Sagaris, and Idas where he stood in front of the turret top; Capys"
6088,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,Privernus: him Themillas' spear had first grazed lightly; the madman
6089,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,threw down his shield to carry his hand to the wound; so the arrow
6090,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"winged her way, and pinning his hand to his left side, broke into the"
6091,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"lungs with deadly wound. The son of Arcens stood splendid in arms, and"
6092,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"scarf embroidered with needlework and bright with Iberian blue, the"
6093,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,beautiful boy sent by his father Arcens from nurture in the grove of our
6094,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Lady about the streams of Symaethus, where Palicus' altar is rich and"
6095,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"gracious. Laying down his spear, Mezentius whirled thrice round his head"
6096,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"the tightened cord of his whistling sling, pierced him full between the"
6097,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"temples with the molten bullet, and stretched him all his length upon"
6098,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,the sand.
6099,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
6100,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Then, it is said, Ascanius first aimed his flying shaft in war, wont"
6101,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"before to frighten beasts of the chase, and struck down a brave"
6102,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Numanian, Remulus by name, but lately allied in bridal to Turnus'"
6103,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,younger sister. He advancing before his ranks clamoured things fit and
6104,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"unfit to tell, and strode along lofty and voluble, his heart lifted up"
6105,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,with his fresh royalty.
6106,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
6107,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"'Take you not shame to be again held leaguered in your ramparts, O"
6108,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Phrygians twice taken, and to make walls your fence from death? Behold"
6109,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"them who demand in war our wives for theirs! What god, what madness,"
6110,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,hath driven you to Italy? Here are no sons of Atreus nor glozing
6111,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Ulysses. A race of hardy breed, we carry our newborn children to the"
6112,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,streams and harden them in the bitter icy water; as boys they spend
6113,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"wakeful nights over the chase, and tire out the woodland; but in"
6114,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"manhood, [607-639]unwearied by toil and trained to poverty, they subdue"
6115,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"the soil with their mattocks, or shake towns in war. Every age wears"
6116,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"iron, and we goad the flanks of our oxen with reversed spear; nor does"
6117,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,creeping old age weaken our strength of spirit or abate our force. White
6118,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,hairs bear the weight of the helmet; and it is ever our delight to drive
6119,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,in fresh spoil and live on our plunder. Yours is embroidered raiment of
6120,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"saffron and shining sea-purple. Indolence is your pleasure, your delight"
6121,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,the luxurious dance; you wear sleeved tunics and ribboned turbans. O
6122,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"right Phrygian women, not even Phrygian men! traverse the heights of"
6123,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Dindymus, where the double-mouthed flute breathes familiar music. The"
6124,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"drums call you, and the Berecyntian boxwood of the mother of Ida; leave"
6125,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"arms to men, and lay down the sword.'"
6126,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
6127,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"As he flung forth such words of ill-ominous strain, Ascanius brooked it"
6128,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"not, and aimed an arrow on him from the stretched horse sinew; and as he"
6129,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"drew his arms asunder, first stayed to supplicate Jove in lowly vows:"
6130,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"'Jupiter omnipotent, deign to favour this daring deed. My hands shall"

6132,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"altars a steer with gilded forehead, snow-white, carrying his head high"
6133,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"as his mother's, already pushing with his horn and making the sand fly"
6134,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,up under his feet.' The Father heard and from a clear space of sky
6135,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"thundered on the left; at once the fated bow rings, the grim-whistling"
6136,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"arrow flies from the tense string, and goes through the head of Remulus,"
6137,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"the steel piercing through from temple to temple. 'Go, mock valour with"
6138,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,insolence of speech! Phrygians twice taken return this answer to
6139,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,Rutulians.' Thus and no further Ascanius; the Teucrians respond in
6140,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"cheers, and shout for joy in rising height of courage. Then haply in the"
6141,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,tract of heaven tressed Apollo sate looking down from his cloud on the
6142,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"[640-673]Ausonian ranks and town, and thus addresses triumphant IÃ¼lus:"
6143,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"'Good speed to thy young valour, O boy! this is the way to heaven, child"
6144,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,of gods and parent of gods to be! Rightly shall all wars fated to come
6145,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,sink to peace beneath the line of Assaracus; nor art thou bounded in a
6146,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Troy.' So speaking, he darts from heaven's height, and cleaving the"
6147,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"breezy air, seeks Ascanius. Then he changes the fashion of his"
6148,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"countenance, and becomes aged Butes, armour-bearer of old to Dardanian"
6149,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Anchises, and the faithful porter of his threshold; thereafter his lord"
6150,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,gave him for Ascanius' attendant. In all points like the old man Apollo
6151,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"came, voice and colour, white hair, and grimly clashing arms, and speaks"
6152,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,these words to eager IÃ¼lus:
6153,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
6154,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"'Be it enough, son of Aeneas, that the Numanian hath fallen unavenged"
6155,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"beneath thine arrows; this first honour great Apollo allows thee, nor"
6156,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"envies the arms that match his own. Further, O boy, let war alone.' Thus"
6157,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Apollo began, and yet speaking retreated from mortal view, vanishing"
6158,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,into thin air away out of their eyes. The Dardanian princes knew the god
6159,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"and the arms of deity, and heard the clash of his quiver as he went. So"
6160,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,they restrain Ascanius' keenness for battle by the words of Phoebus'
6161,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"will; themselves they again close in conflict, and cast their lives into"
6162,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,the perilous breach. Shouts run all along the battlemented walls;
6163,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,ringing bows are drawn and javelin thongs twisted: all the ground is
6164,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,strewn with missiles. Shields and hollow helmets ring to blows; the
6165,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,battle swells fierce; heavy as the shower lashes the ground that sets in
6166,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,when the Kids are rainy in the West; thick as hail pours down from
6167,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"storm-clouds on the shallows, when the rough lord of the winds congeals"
6168,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,his watery deluge and breaks up the hollow vapours in the sky.
6169,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
6170,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Pandarus and Bitias, sprung of Alcanor of Ida, whom woodland Iaera bore"
6171,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"in the grove of Jupiter, grown now [674-709]tall as their ancestral"
6172,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"pines and hills, fling open the gates barred by their captain's order,"
6173,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"and confident in arms, wilfully invite the enemy within the walls."
6174,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Themselves within they stand to right and left in front of the towers,"
6175,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"sheathed in iron, the plumes flickering over their stately heads: even"
6176,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"as high in air around the gliding streams, whether on Padus' banks or by"
6177,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"pleasant Athesis, twin oaks rise lifting their unshorn heads into the"
6178,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,sky with high tops asway. The Rutulians pour in when they see the
6179,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"entrance open. Straightway Quercens and Aquicolus beautiful in arms, and"
6180,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"desperate Tmarus, and Haemon, seed of Mars, either gave back in rout"
6181,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"with all their columns, or in the very gateway laid down their life."
6182,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Then the spirits of the combatants swell in rising wrath, and now the"
6183,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Trojans gather swarming to the spot, and dare to close hand to hand and"
6184,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,to sally farther out.
6185,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
6186,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"News is brought to Turnus the captain, as he rages afar among the routed"
6187,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"foe, that the enemy surges forth into fresh slaughter and flings wide"
6188,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"his gates. He breaks off unfinished, and, fired with immense anger,"
6189,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,rushes towards the haughty brethren at the Dardanian gate. And on
6190,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Antiphates first, for first he came, the bastard son of mighty Sarpedon"
6191,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"by a Theban mother, he hurls his javelin and strikes him down; the"
6192,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Italian cornel flies through the yielding air, and, piercing the gullet,"
6193,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,runs deep into his breast; a frothing tide pours from the dark yawning
6194,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"wound, and the steel grows warm where it pierces the lung. Then Meropes"
6195,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"and Erymas, then Aphidnus goes down before his hand; then Bitias,"
6196,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"fiery-eyed and exultant, not with a javelin; for not to a javelin had he"
6197,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,given his life; but the loud-whistling pike came hurled with a
6198,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"thunderbolt's force; neither twofold bull's hide kept it back, nor the"
6199,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,trusty corslet's double scales of gold: his vast limbs sink in a heap;
6200,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"earth utters a groan, and the great shield clashes [710-745]over him:"
6201,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,even as once and again on the EuboÃ¯c shore of Baiae falls a mass of
6202,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"stone, built up of great blocks and so cast into the sea; thus does it"
6203,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"tumble prone, crashes into the shoal water and sinks deep to rest; the"
6204,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"seas are stirred, and the dark sand eddies up; therewith the depth of"
6205,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Prochyta quivers at the sound, and the couchant rocks of Inarime, piled"
6206,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,above Typhoeus by Jove's commands.
6207,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
6208,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"On this Mars armipotent raised the spirit and strength of the Latins,"
6209,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"and goaded their hearts to rage, and sent Flight and dark Fear among the"
6210,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Teucrians. From all quarters they gather, since battle is freely"
6211,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"offered; and the warrior god inspires. . . . Pandarus, at his brother's"
6212,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"fall, sees how fortune stands, what hap rules the day; and swinging the"
6213,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"gate round on its hinge with all his force, pushes it to with his broad"
6214,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"shoulders, leaving many of his own people shut outside the walls in the"
6215,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"desperate conflict, but shutting others in with him as they pour back in"
6216,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,retreat. Madman! who saw not the Rutulian prince burst in amid their
6217,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"columns, and fairly shut him into the town, like a monstrous tiger among"
6218,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"the silly flocks. At once strange light flashed from his eyes, and his"
6219,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"armour rang terribly; the blood-red plumes flicker on his head, and"
6220,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,lightnings shoot sparkling from his shield. In sudden dismay the
6221,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,Aeneadae know the hated form and giant limbs. Then tall Pandarus leaps
6222,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"forward, in burning rage at his brother's death: 'This is not the palace"
6223,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"of Amata's dower,' he cries, 'nor does Ardea enclose Turnus in her"
6224,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,native walls. Thou seest a hostile camp; escape hence is hopeless.' To
6225,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"him Turnus, smiling and cool: 'Begin with all thy valiance, and close"
6226,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,hand to hand; here too shalt thou tell that a Priam found his Achilles.'
6227,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"He ended; the other, putting out all his strength, hurls his rough"
6228,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"spear, knotty and unpeeled. The breezes caught it; Juno, daughter of"
6229,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Saturn, [746-780]made the wound glance off as it came, and the spear"
6230,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"sticks fast in the gate. 'But this weapon that my strong hand whirls,"
6231,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,this thou shalt not escape; for not such is he who sends weapon and
6232,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"wound.' So speaks he, and rises high on his uplifted sword; the steel"
6233,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"severs the forehead midway right between the temples, and divides the"
6234,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,beardless cheeks with ghastly wound. He crashes down; earth shakes under
6235,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,the vast weight; dying limbs and brain-spattered armour tumble in a heap
6236,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"to the ground, and the head, evenly severed, dangles this way and that"
6237,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,from either shoulder. The Trojans scatter and turn in hasty terror; and
6238,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,had the conqueror forthwith taken thought to burst the bars and let in
6239,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"his comrades at the gate, that had been the last day of the war and of"
6240,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,the nation. But rage and mad thirst of slaughter drive him like fire on
6241,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"the foe. . . . First he catches up Phalaris; then Gyges, and hamstrings"
6242,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"him; he plucks away their spears, and hurls them on the backs of the"
6243,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,flying crowd; Juno lends strength and courage. Halys he sends to join
6244,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"them, and Phegeus, pierced right through the shield; then, as they"
6245,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"ignorantly raised their war-cry on the walls, Alcander and Halius,"
6246,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"NoÃ«mon and Prytanis. Lynceus advanced to meet him, calling up his"
6247,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,comrades; from the rampart the glittering sword sweeps to the left and
6248,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"catches him; struck off by the one downright blow, head and helmet lay"
6249,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"far away. Next Amycus fell, the deadly huntsman, incomparable in skill"
6250,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,of hand to anoint his arrows and arm their steel with venom; and Clytius
6251,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"the Aeolid, and Cretheus beloved of the Muses, Cretheus of the Muses'"
6252,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"company, whose delight was ever in songs and harps and stringing of"
6253,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,verses; ever he sang of steeds and armed men and battles.
6254,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
6255,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"At last, hearing of the slaughter of their men, the Teucrian captains,"
6256,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Mnestheus and gallant Serestus, come up, and see their comrades in"
6257,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,disordered flight and the foe [781-814]let in. And Mnestheus: 'Whither
6258,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"next, whither press you in flight? what other walls, what farther city"
6259,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"have you yet? Shall one man, and he girt in on all sides,"
6260,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"fellow-citizens, by your entrenchments, thus unchecked deal devastation"
6261,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"throughout our city, and send all our best warriors to the under world?"
6262,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Have you no pity, no shame, cowards, for your unhappy country, for your"
6263,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"ancient gods, for great Aeneas?'"
6264,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,
6265,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Kindled by such words, they take heart and rally in dense array. Little"
6266,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"by little Turnus drew away from the fight towards the river, and the"
6267,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,side encircled by the stream: the more bravely the Teucrians press on
6268,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"him with loud shouts and thickening masses, even as a band that fall on"
6269,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"a wrathful lion with levelled weapons, but he, frightened back, retires"
6270,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,surly and grim-glaring; and neither does wrath nor courage let him turn
6271,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"his back, nor can he make head, for all that he desires it, against the"
6272,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"surrounding arms and men. Even thus Turnus draws lingeringly backward,"
6273,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"with unhastened steps, and soul boiling in anger. Nay, twice even then"
6274,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"did he charge amid the enemy, twice drove them in flying rout along the"
6275,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"walls. But all the force of the camp gathers hastily up; nor does Juno,"
6276,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"daughter of Saturn, dare to supply him strength to countervail; for"
6277,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Jupiter sent Iris down through the aery sky, bearing stern orders to his"
6278,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,sister that Turnus shall withdraw from the high Trojan town. Therefore
6279,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"neither with shield nor hand can he keep his ground, so overpoweringly"
6280,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,from all sides comes upon him the storm of weapons. About the hollows of
6281,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"his temples the helmet rings with incessant clash, and the solid brass"
6282,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,is riven beneath the stones; the horsehair crest is rent away; the
6283,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,shield-boss avails not under the blows; Mnestheus thunders on with his
6284,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"Trojans, and pours in a storm of spears. All over him the sweat trickles"
6285,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"and pours in swart stream, and no breathing space is given; sick gasps"
6286,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"shake [815-818]his exhausted limbs. Then at last, with a headlong"
6287,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"bound, he leapt fully armed into the river; the river's yellow eddies"
6288,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"opened for him as he came, and the buoyant water brought him up, and,"
6289,THE SIEGE OF THE TROJAN CAMP,"washing away the slaughter, returned him triumphant to his comrades."

6298,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,
6299,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Meanwhile the heavenly house omnipotent unfolds her doors, and the"
6300,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,father of gods and king of men calls a council in the starry dwelling;
6301,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"whence he looks sheer down on the whole earth, the Dardanian camp, and"
6302,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,the peoples of Latium. They sit down within from doorway to doorway:
6303,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,their lord begins:
6304,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,
6305,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"'Lords of heaven, wherefore is your decree turned back, and your minds"
6306,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,thus jealously at strife? I forbade Italy to join battle with the
6307,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,Teucrians; why this quarrel in face of my injunction? What terror hath
6308,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,bidden one or another run after arms and tempt the sword? The due time
6309,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"of battle will arrive, call it not forth, when furious Carthage shall"
6310,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,one day sunder the Alps to hurl ruin full on the towers of Rome. Then
6311,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"hatred may grapple with hatred, then hostilities be opened; now let them"
6312,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"be, and cheerfully join in the treaty we ordain.'"
6313,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,
6314,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,Thus Jupiter in brief; but not briefly golden Venus returns in
6315,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,answer: . . .
6316,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,
6317,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"'O Lord, O everlasting Governor of men and things--for what else may we"
6318,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"yet supplicate?--beholdest thou how the Rutulians brave it, and Turnus,"
6319,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"borne charioted through the ranks, proudly sweeps down the tide of"
6320,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"battle? Bar [22-58]and bulwark no longer shelter the Trojans; nay,"
6321,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,within the gates and even on the mounded walls they clash in battle and
6322,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,make the trenches swim with blood. Aeneas is away and ignorant. Wilt
6323,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,thou never then let our leaguer be raised? Again a foe overhangs the
6324,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"walls of infant Troy; and another army, and a second son of Tydeus rises"
6325,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,from Aetolian Arpi against the Trojans. Truly I think my wounds are yet
6326,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"to come, and I thy child am keeping some mortal weapons idle. If the"
6327,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Trojans steered for Italy without thy leave and defiant of thy deity,"
6328,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,let them expiate their sin; aid not such with thy succour. But if so
6329,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"many oracles guided them, given by god and ghost, why may aught now"
6330,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,reverse thine ordinance or write destiny anew? Why should I recall the
6331,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"fleets burned on the coast of Eryx? why the king of storms, and the"
6332,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"raging winds roused from Aeolia, or Iris driven down the clouds? Now"
6333,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,hell too is stirred (this share of the world was yet untried) and
6334,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,Allecto suddenly let loose above to riot through the Italian towns. In
6335,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,no wise am I moved for empire; that was our hope while Fortune stood;
6336,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,let those conquer whom thou wilt. If thy cruel wife leave no region free
6337,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"to Teucrians, by the smoking ruins of desolated Troy, O father, I"
6338,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"beseech thee, grant Ascanius unhurt retreat from arms, grant me my"
6339,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,child's life. Aeneas may well be tossed over unknown seas and follow
6340,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,what path soever fortune open to him; him let me avail to shelter and
6341,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"withdraw from the turmoil of battle. Amathus is mine, high Paphos and"
6342,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Cythera, and my house of Idalia; here, far from arms, let him spend an"
6343,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,inglorious life. Bid Carthage in high lordship rule Ausonia; there will
6344,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,be nothing there to check the Tyrian cities. What help was it for the
6345,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,Trojans to escape war's doom and thread their flight through Argive
6346,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"fires, to have exhausted all those perils of sea and desolate lands,"
6347,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,while they seek Latium and the towers of a Troy rebuilt? Were it not
6348,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"better to have [59-91]clung to the last ashes of their country, and the"
6349,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"ground where once was Troy? Give back, I pray, Xanthus and SimoÃ¯s to a"
6350,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"wretched people, and let the Teucrians again, O Lord, circle through the"
6351,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,fates of Ilium.'
6352,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,
6353,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Then Queen Juno, swift and passionate:"
6354,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,
6355,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,'Why forcest thou me to break long silence and proclaim my hidden pain?
6356,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,Hath any man or god constrained Aeneas to court war or make armed attack
6357,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,on King Latinus? In oracular guidance he steered for Italy: be it so: he
6358,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,whom raving Cassandra sent on his way! Did we urge him to quit the camp
6359,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,or entrust his life to the winds? to give the issue of war and the
6360,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,charge of his ramparts to a child? to stir the loyalty of Tyrrhenia or
6361,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"throw peaceful nations into tumult? What god, what potent cruelty of"
6362,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"ours, hath driven him on his hurt? Where is Juno in this, or Iris sped"
6363,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,down the clouds? It shocks thee that Italians should enring an infant
6364,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Troy with flame, and Turnus set foot on his own ancestral soil--he,"
6365,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"grandchild of Pilumnus, son of Venilia the goddess: how, that the dark"
6366,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,brands of Troy assail the Latins? that Trojans subjugate and plunder
6367,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"fields not their own? how, that they choose their brides and tear"
6368,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"plighted bosom from bosom? that their gestures plead for peace, and"
6369,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,their ships are lined with arms? Thou canst steal thine Aeneas from
6370,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Grecian hands, and spread before them a human semblance of mist and"
6371,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,empty air; thou canst turn his fleet into nymphs of like number: is it
6372,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,dreadful if we retaliate with any aid to the Rutulians? Aeneas is away
6373,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"and ignorant; away and ignorant let him be. Paphos is thine and Idalium,"
6374,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,thine high Cythera; why meddlest thou with fierce spirits and a city big
6375,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,with war? Is it we who would overthrow the tottering state of Phrygia?
6376,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,we? or he who brought the Achaeans down on the hapless Trojans? who made
6377,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Europe and Asia bristle up in arms, and whose theft shattered the"
6378,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,alliance? Was it in my guidance the [92-125]adulterous Dardanian broke
6379,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,into Sparta? or did I send the shafts of passion that kindled war? Then
6380,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,terror for thy children had graced thee; too late now dost thou rise
6381,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"with unjust complaints, and reproaches leave thy lips in vain.'"
6382,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,
6383,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,Thus Juno pleaded; and all the heavenly people murmured in diverse
6384,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"consent; even as rising gusts murmur when caught in the forests, and"
6385,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"eddy in blind moanings, betraying to sailors the gale's approach. Then"
6386,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,the Lord omnipotent and primal power of the world begins; as he speaks
6387,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,the high house of the gods and trembling floor of earth sink to silence;
6388,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"silent is the deep sky, and the breezes are stilled; ocean hushes his"
6389,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,waters into calm.
6390,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,
6391,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,'Take then to heart and lay deep these words of mine. Since it may not
6392,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"be that Ausonians and Teucrians join alliance, and your quarrel finds no"
6393,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"term, to-day, what fortune each wins, what hope each follows, be he"
6394,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Trojan or Rutulian, I will hold in even poise; whether it be Italy's"
6395,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,fate or Trojan blundering and ill advice that holds the camp in leaguer.
6396,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,Nor do I acquit the Rutulians. Each as he hath begun shall work out his
6397,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,destiny. Jupiter is one and king over all; the fates will find their
6398,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"way.' By his brother's infernal streams, by the banks of the pitchy"
6399,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"black-boiling chasm he signed assent, and made all Olympus quiver at his"
6400,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"nod. Here speaking ended: thereon Jupiter rises from his golden throne,"
6401,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,and the heavenly people surround and escort him to the doorway.
6402,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,
6403,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Meanwhile the Rutulians press round all the gates, dealing grim"
6404,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,slaughter and girdling the walls with flame. But the army of the
6405,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Aeneadae are held leaguered within their trenches, with no hope of"
6406,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"retreat. They stand helpless and disconsolate on their high towers, and"
6407,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"their thin ring girdles the walls,--Asius, son of Imbrasus, and"
6408,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Thymoetes, son of Hicetaon, and the two Assaraci, and Castor, and old"
6409,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,Thymbris together in the front rank: by them Clarus and
6410,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"[126-160]Themon, both full brothers to Sarpedon, out of high Lycia."
6411,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Acmon of Lyrnesus, great as his father Clytius, or his brother"
6412,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Mnestheus, carries a stone, straining all his vast frame to the huge"
6413,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"mountain fragment. Emulously they keep their guard, these with javelins,"
6414,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"those with stones, and wield fire and fit arrows on the string. Amid"
6415,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"them he, Venus' fittest care, lo! the Dardanian boy, his graceful head"
6416,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"uncovered, shines even as a gem set in red gold on ornament of throat or"
6417,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"head, or even as gleaming ivory cunningly inlaid in boxwood or Orician"
6418,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"terebinth; his tresses lie spread over his milk-white neck, bound by a"
6419,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"flexible circlet of gold. Thee, too, Ismarus, proud nations saw aiming"
6420,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"wounds and arming thy shafts with poison,--thee, of house illustrious in"
6421,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Maeonia, where the rich tilth is wrought by men's hands, and Pactolus"
6422,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"waters it with gold. There too was Mnestheus, exalted in fame as he who"
6423,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"erewhile had driven Turnus from the ramparts; and Capys, from whom is"
6424,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,drawn the name of the Campanian city.
6425,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,
6426,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"They had closed in grim war's mutual conflict; Aeneas, while night was"
6427,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"yet deep, clove the seas. For when, leaving Evander for the Etruscan"
6428,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"camp, he hath audience of the king, and tells the king of his name and"
6429,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"race, and what he asks or offers, instructs him of the arms Mezentius is"
6430,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"winning to his side, and of Turnus' overbearing spirit, reminds him what"
6431,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"is all the certainty of human things, and mingles all with entreaties;"
6432,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"delaying not, Tarchon joins forces and strikes alliance. Then, freed"
6433,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"from the oracle, the Lydian people man their fleet, laid by divine"
6434,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"ordinance in the foreign captain's hand. Aeneas' galley keeps in front,"
6435,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"with the lions of Phrygia fastened on her prow, above them overhanging"
6436,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Ida, sight most welcome to the Trojan exiles. Here great Aeneas sits"
6437,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"revolving the changing issues of war; and Pallas, clinging on his left"
6438,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"side, asks now [161-195]of the stars and their pathway through the dark"
6439,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"night, now of his fortunes by land and sea."
6440,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,
6441,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Open now the gates of Helicon, goddesses, and stir the song of the band"
6442,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"that come the while with Aeneas from the Tuscan borders, and sail in"
6443,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,armed ships overseas.
6444,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,
6445,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,First in the brazen-plated Tiger Massicus cuts the flood; beneath him
6446,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,are ranked a thousand men who have left Clusium town and the city of
6447,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Cosae; their weapons are arrows, and light quivers on the shoulder, and"
6448,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"their deadly bow. With him goes grim Abas, all his train in shining"
6449,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"armour, and a gilded Apollo glittering astern. To him Populonia had"
6450,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"given six hundred of her children, tried in war, but Ilva three hundred,"
6451,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"the island rich in unexhausted mines of steel. Third Asilas, interpreter"
6452,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"between men and gods, master of the entrails of beasts and the stars in"
6453,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"heaven, of speech of birds and ominous lightning flashes, draws a"
6454,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"thousand men after him in serried lines bristling with spears, bidden to"
6455,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"his command from Pisa city, of Alphaean birth on Etruscan soil. Astyr"
6456,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"follows, excellent in beauty, Astyr, confident in his horse and glancing"
6457,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,arms. Three hundred more--all have one heart to follow--come from the
6458,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"householders of Caere and the fields of Minio, and ancient Pyrgi, and"
6459,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,fever-stricken Graviscae.
6460,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,
6461,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Let me not pass thee by, O Cinyras, bravest in war of Ligurian captains,"
6462,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"and thee, Cupavo, with thy scant company, from whose crest rise the swan"
6463,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"plumes, fault, O Love, of thee and thine, and blazonment of his father's"
6464,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"form. For they tell that Cycnus, in grief for his beloved PhaÃ«thon,"
6465,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,while he sings and soothes his woeful love with music amid the shady
6466,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"sisterhood of poplar boughs, drew over him the soft plumage of white old"
6467,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"age, and left earth and passed crying through the sky. His son, followed"
6468,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"on shipboard with a band of like age, sweeps the huge Centaur forward"
6469,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"with his oars; he leans over the water, and [196-227]threatens the"
6470,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"waves with a vast rock he holds on high, and furrows the deep seas with"
6471,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,his length of keel.
6472,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,
6473,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"He too calls a train from his native coasts, Ocnus, son of prophetic"
6474,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Manto and the river of Tuscany, who gave thee, O Mantua, ramparts and"
6475,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"his mother's name; Mantua, rich in ancestry, yet not all of one blood, a"
6476,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"threefold race, and under each race four cantons; herself she is the"
6477,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"cantons' head, and her strength is of Tuscan blood. From her likewise"
6478,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"hath Mezentius five hundred in arms against him, whom Mincius, child of"
6479,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Benacus, draped in gray reeds, led to battle in his advancing pine."
6480,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Aulestes moves on heavily, smiting the waves with the swinging forest of"
6481,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,an hundred oars; the channels foam as they sweep the sea-floor. He sails
6482,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"in the vast Triton, who amazes the blue waterways with his shell, and"
6483,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"swims on with shaggy front, in human show from the flank upward; his"
6484,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,belly ends in a dragon; beneath the monster's breast the wave gurgles
6485,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,into foam. So many were the chosen princes who went in thirty ships to
6486,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"aid Troy, and cut the salt plains with brazen prow."
6487,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,
6488,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"And now day had faded from the sky, and gracious Phoebe trod mid-heaven"
6489,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"in the chariot of her nightly wandering: Aeneas, for his charge allows"
6490,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"not rest to his limbs, himself sits guiding the tiller and managing the"
6491,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"sails. And lo, in middle course a band of his own fellow-voyagers meets"
6492,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"him, the nymphs whom bountiful Cybele had bidden be gods of the sea, and"
6493,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"turn to nymphs from ships; they swam on in even order, and cleft the"
6494,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"flood, as many as erewhile, brazen-plated prows, had anchored on the"
6495,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"beach. From far they know their king, and wheel their bands about him,"
6496,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"and Cymodocea, their readiest in speech, comes up behind, catching the"
6497,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"stern with her right hand: her back rises out, and her left hand oars"
6498,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,her passage through the silent water. Then she thus [228-261]accosts
6499,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"her amazed lord: 'Wakest thou, seed of gods, Aeneas? wake, and loosen"
6500,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"the sheets of thy sails. We are thy fleet, Idaean pines from the holy"
6501,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"hill, now nymphs of the sea. When the treacherous Rutulian urged us"
6502,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"headlong with sword and fire, unwillingly we broke thy bonds, and we"
6503,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"search for thee over ocean. This new guise our Lady made for us in pity,"
6504,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,and granted us to be goddesses and spend our life under the waves. But
6505,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,thy boy Ascanius is held within wall and trench among the Latin weapons
6506,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,and the rough edge of war. Already the Arcadian cavalry and the brave
6507,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,Etruscan together hold the appointed ground. Turnus' plan is fixed to
6508,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"bar their way with his squadrons, that they may not reach the camp. Up"
6509,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"and arise, and ere the coming of the Dawn bid thy crews be called to"
6510,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,arms; and take thou the shield which the Lord of Fire forged for victory
6511,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"and rimmed about with gold. To-morrow's daylight, if thou deem not my"
6512,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"words vain, shall see Rutulians heaped high in slaughter.' She ended,"
6513,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"and, as she went, pushed the tall ship on with her hand wisely and well;"
6514,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,the ship shoots through the water fleeter than javelin or windswift
6515,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,arrow. Thereat the rest quicken their speed. The son of Anchises of Troy
6516,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,is himself deep in bewilderment; yet the omen cheers his courage. Then
6517,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"looking on the heavenly vault, he briefly prays: 'O gracious upon Ida,"
6518,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"mother of gods, whose delight is in Dindymus and turreted cities and"
6519,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"lions coupled to thy rein, do thou lead me in battle, do thou meetly"
6520,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"prosper thine augury, and draw nigh thy Phrygians, goddess, with"
6521,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,favourable feet.' Thus much he spoke; and meanwhile the broad light of
6522,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"returning day now began to pour in, and chased away the night. First he"
6523,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"commands his comrades to follow his signals, brace their courage to arms"
6524,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,and prepare for battle. And now his Trojans and his camp are in his
6525,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"sight as he stands high astern, when next he lifts the [262-296]blazing"
6526,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,shield on his left arm. The Dardanians on the walls raise a shout to the
6527,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,sky. Hope comes to kindle wrath; they hurl their missiles strongly; even
6528,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,as under black clouds cranes from the Strymon utter their signal notes
6529,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"and sail clamouring across the sky, and noisily stream down the gale."
6530,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,But this seemed marvellous to the Rutulian king and the captains of
6531,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Ausonia, till looking back they see the ships steering for the beach,"
6532,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"and all the sea as a single fleet sailing in. His helmet-spike blazes,"
6533,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"flame pours from the cresting plumes, and the golden shield-boss spouts"
6534,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,floods of fire; even as when in transparent night comets glow blood-red
6535,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"and drear, or the splendour of Sirius, that brings drought and"
6536,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"sicknesses on wretched men, rises and saddens the sky with malignant"
6537,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,beams.
6538,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,
6539,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,Yet gallant Turnus in unfailing confidence will prevent them on the
6540,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,shore and repel their approach to land. 'What your prayers have sought
6541,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"is given, the sweep of the sword-arm. The god of battles is in the hands"
6542,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,of men. Now remember each his wife and home: now recall the high deeds
6543,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"of our fathers' honour. Let us challenge meeting at the water's edge,"
6544,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,while they waver and their feet yet slip as they disembark. Fortune aids
6545,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"daring. . . .' So speaks he, and counsels inly whom he shall lead to"
6546,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"meet them, whom leave in charge of the leaguered walls."
6547,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,
6548,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,Meanwhile Aeneas lands his allies by gangways from the high ships. Many
6549,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"watch the retreat and slack of the sea, and leap boldly into the shoal"
6550,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"water; others slide down the oars. Tarchon, marking the shore where the"
6551,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"shallows do not seethe and plash with broken water, but the sea glides"
6552,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"up and spreads its tide unbroken, suddenly turns his bows to land and"
6553,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"implores his comrades: 'Now, O chosen crew, bend strongly to your oars;"
6554,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"lift your ships, make them go; let the prows cleave this hostile land"
6555,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,and the keel plough [297-330]herself a furrow. I will let my vessel
6556,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,break up on such harbourage if once she takes the land.' When Tarchon
6557,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"had spoken in such wise, his comrades rise on their oar-blades and carry"
6558,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"their ships in foam towards the Latin fields, till the prows are fast on"
6559,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"dry land and all the keels are aground unhurt. But not thy galley,"
6560,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Tarchon; for she dashes on a shoal, and swings long swaying on the cruel"
6561,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"bank, pitching and slapping the flood, then breaks up, and lands her"
6562,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"crew among the waves. Broken oars and floating thwarts entangle them,"
6563,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,and the ebbing wave sucks their feet away.
6564,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,
6565,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Nor does Turnus keep idly dallying, but swiftly hurries his whole array"
6566,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,against the Trojans and ranges it to face the beach. The trumpets blow.
6567,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"At once Aeneas charges and confounds the rustic squadrons of the Latins,"
6568,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,and slays Theron for omen of battle. The giant advances to challenge
6569,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,Aeneas; but through sewed plates of brass and tunic rough with gold the
6570,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"sword plunges in his open side. Next he strikes Lichas, cut from his"
6571,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"mother already dead, and consecrated, Phoebus, to thee, since his"
6572,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,infancy was granted escape from the perilous steel. Near thereby he
6573,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"struck dead brawny Cisseus and vast Gyas, whose clubs were mowing down"
6574,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,whole files: naught availed them the arms of Hercules and their strength
6575,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"of hand, nor Melampus their father, ever of Alcides' company while earth"
6576,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,yielded him sore travail. Lo! while Pharus utters weak vaunts the hurled
6577,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"javelin strikes on his shouting mouth. Thou too, while thou followest"
6578,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"thy new delight, Clytius, whose cheeks are golden with youthful"
6579,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"down--thou, luckless Cydon, struck down by the Dardanian hand, wert"
6580,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"lying past thought, ah pitiable! of the young loves that were ever"
6581,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"thine, did not the close array of thy brethren interpose, the children"
6582,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"of Phorcus, seven in number, and send a sevenfold shower of darts. Some"
6583,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,glance ineffectual from helmet and shield; [331-365]some Venus the
6584,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,bountiful turned aside as they grazed his body. Aeneas calls to trusty
6585,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,Achates: 'Give me store of weapons; none that hath been planted in
6586,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,Grecian body on the plains of Ilium shall my hand hurl at Rutulian in
6587,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,vain.' Then he catches and throws his great spear; the spear flies
6588,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"grinding through the brass of Maeon's shield, and breaks through corslet"
6589,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,and through breast. His brother Alcanor runs up and sustains with his
6590,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,right arm his sinking brother; through his arm the spear passes speeding
6591,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"straight on its message, and holds its bloody way, and the hand dangles"
6592,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"by the sinews lifeless from the shoulder. Then Numitor, seizing his dead"
6593,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"brother's javelin, aims at Aeneas, but might not fairly pierce him, and"
6594,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,grazed tall Achates on the thigh. Here Clausus of Cures comes confident
6595,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"in his pride of strength, and with a long reach strikes Dryops under the"
6596,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"chin, and, urging the stiff spear-shaft home, stops the accents of his"
6597,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"speech and his life together, piercing the throat; but he strikes the"
6598,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"earth with his forehead, and vomits clots of blood. Three Thracians"
6599,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"likewise of Boreas' sovereign race, and three sent by their father Idas"
6600,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"from their native Ismarus, fall in divers wise before him. Halesus and"
6601,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"his Auruncan troops hasten thither; Messapus too, seed of Neptune, comes"
6602,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"up charioted. This side and that strive to hurl back the enemy, and"
6603,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,fight hard on the very edge of Ausonia. As when in the depth of air
6604,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"adverse winds rise in battle with equal spirit and strength; not they,"
6605,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"not clouds nor sea, yield one to another; long the battle is doubtful;"
6606,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,all stands locked in counterpoise: even thus clash the ranks of Troy and
6607,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"ranks of Latium, foot fast on foot, and man crowded up on man."
6608,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,
6609,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"But in another quarter, where a torrent had driven a wide path of"
6610,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"rolling stones and bushes torn away from the banks, Pallas saw his"
6611,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Arcadians, unaccustomed to move as infantry, giving back before the"
6612,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Latin pursuit, when the [366-400]roughness of the ground bade them"
6613,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"dismount. This only was left in his strait, to kindle them to valour,"
6614,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"now by entreaties, now by taunts: 'Whither flee you, comrades? by your"
6615,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"deeds of bravery, by your leader Evander's name, by your triumphant"
6616,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"campaigns, and my hope that now rises to rival my father's honour, trust"
6617,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,not to flight. Our swords must hew a way through the enemy. Where yonder
6618,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"mass of men presses thickest, there your proud country calls you with"
6619,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Pallas at your head. No gods are they who bear us down; mortals, we feel"
6620,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"the pressure of a mortal foe; we have as many lives and hands as he. Lo,"
6621,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,the deep shuts us in with vast sea barrier; even now land fails our
6622,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,flight; shall we make ocean or Troy our goal?'
6623,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,
6624,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"So speaks he, and bursts amid the serried foe. First Lagus meets him,"
6625,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"drawn thither by malign destiny; him, as he tugs at a ponderous stone,"
6626,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"hurling his spear where the spine ran dissevering the ribs, he pierces"
6627,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,and wrenches out the spear where it stuck fast in the bone. Nor does
6628,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Hisbo catch him stooping, for all that he hoped it; for Pallas, as he"
6629,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"rushes unguarded on, furious at his comrade's cruel death, receives him"
6630,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,on his sword and buries it in his distended lungs. Next he attacks
6631,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Sthenius, and Anchemolus of Rhoetus' ancient family, who dared to"
6632,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"violate the bridal chamber of his stepmother. You, too, the twins"
6633,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Larides and Thymber, fell on the Rutulian fields, children of Daucus,"
6634,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,indistinguishable for likeness and a sweet perplexity to your parents.
6635,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"But now Pallas made cruel difference between you; for thy head, Thymber,"
6636,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"is swept off by Evander's sword; thy right hand, Larides, severed, seeks"
6637,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"its master, and the dying fingers jerk and clutch at the sword. Fired by"
6638,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"his encouragement, and beholding his noble deeds, the Arcadians advance"
6639,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,in wrath and shame to meet the enemy in arms. Then Pallas pierces
6640,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Rhoeteus as he flies past in his chariot. This space, this"
6641,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,[401-435]much of respite was given to Ilus; for at Ilus he had aimed
6642,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"the strong spear from afar, and Rhoeteus intercepts its passage, in"
6643,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"flight from thee, noble Teuthras and Tyres thy brother; he rolls from"
6644,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"the chariot in death, and his heels strike the Rutulian fields. And as"
6645,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"the shepherd, when summer winds have risen to his desire, kindles the"
6646,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"woods dispersedly; on a sudden the mid spaces catch, and a single"
6647,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,flickering line of fire spreads wide over the plain; he sits looking
6648,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"down on his conquest and the revel of the flames; even so, Pallas, do"
6649,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,thy brave comrades gather close to sustain thee. But warrior Halesus
6650,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"advances full on them, gathering himself behind his armour; he slays"
6651,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Ladon, Pheres, Demodocus; his gleaming sword shears off Strymonius' hand"
6652,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"as it rises to his throat; he strikes Thoas on the face with a stone,"
6653,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,and drives the bones asunder in a shattered mass of blood and brains.
6654,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,Halesus had his father the soothsayer kept hidden in the woodland: when
6655,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"the old man's glazing eyes sank to death, the Fates laid hand on him and"
6656,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"devoted him to the arms of Evander. Pallas aims at him, first praying"
6657,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"thus: 'Grant now, lord Tiber, to the steel I poise and hurl, a"
6658,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,prosperous way through brawny Halesus' breast; thine oak shall bear
6659,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,these arms and the dress he wore.' The god heard it; while Halesus
6660,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"covers Imaon, he leaves, alas! his breast unarmed to the Arcadian's"
6661,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"weapon. Yet at his grievous death Lausus, himself a great arm of the"
6662,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"war, lets not his columns be dismayed; at once he meets and cuts down"
6663,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Abas, the check and stay of their battle. The men of Arcadia go down"
6664,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"before him; down go the Etruscans, and you, O Teucrians, invincible by"
6665,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Greece. The armies close, matched in strength and in captains; the rear"
6666,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,ranks crowd in; weapons and hands are locked in the press. Here Pallas
6667,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"strains and pushes on, here Lausus opposite, nearly matched in age,"
6668,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,excellent in beauty; but fortune [436-467]had denied both return to
6669,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,their own land. Yet that they should meet face to face the sovereign of
6670,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,high Olympus allowed not; an early fate awaits them beneath a mightier
6671,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,foe.
6672,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,
6673,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Meanwhile Turnus' gracious sister bids him take Lausus' room, and his"
6674,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"fleet chariot parts the ranks. When he saw his comrades, 'It is time,'"
6675,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"he cried, 'to stay from battle. I alone must assail Pallas; to me and"
6676,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,none other Pallas is due; I would his father himself were here to see.'
6677,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"So speaks he, and his Rutulians draw back from a level space at his"
6678,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"bidding. But then as they withdrew, he, wondering at the haughty"
6679,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"command, stands in amaze at Turnus, his eyes scanning the vast frame,"
6680,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,and his fierce glance perusing him from afar. And with these words he
6681,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"returns the words of the monarch: 'For me, my praise shall even now be"
6682,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"in the lordly spoils I win, or in illustrious death: my father will bear"
6683,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"calmly either lot: away with menaces.' He speaks, and advances into the"
6684,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,level ring. The Arcadians' blood gathers chill about their hearts.
6685,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,Turnus leaps from his chariot and prepares to close with him. And as a
6686,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,lion sees from some lofty outlook a bull stand far off on the plain
6687,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"revolving battle, and flies at him, even such to see is Turnus' coming."
6688,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"When Pallas deemed him within reach of a spear-throw, he advances, if so"
6689,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"chance may assist the daring of his overmatched strength, and thus cries"
6690,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,into the depth of sky: 'By my father's hospitality and the board whereto
6691,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"thou camest a wanderer, on thee I call, Alcides; be favourable to my"
6692,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,high emprise; let Turnus even in death discern me stripping his
6693,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"blood-stained armour, and his swooning eyes endure the sight of his"
6694,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"conqueror.' Alcides heard him, and deep in his heart he stifled a heavy"
6695,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"sigh, and let idle tears fall. Then with kindly words the father accosts"
6696,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,his son: 'Each hath his own appointed day; short and irrecoverable
6697,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,[468-502]is the span of life for all: but to spread renown by deeds is
6698,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,the task of valour. Under high Troy town many and many a god's son fell;
6699,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"nay, mine own child Sarpedon likewise perished. Turnus too his own fate"
6700,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"summons, and his allotted period hath reached the goal.' So speaks he,"
6701,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,and turns his eyes away from the Rutulian fields. But Pallas hurls his
6702,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"spear with all his strength, and pulls his sword flashing out of the"
6703,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,hollow scabbard. The flying spear lights where the armour rises high
6704,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"above the shoulder, and, forcing a way through the shield's rim, ceased"
6705,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,not till it drew blood from mighty Turnus. At this Turnus long poises
6706,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"the spear-shaft with its sharp steel head, and hurls it on Pallas with"
6707,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,these words: _See thou if our weapon have not a keener point._ He ended;
6708,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"but for all the shield's plating of iron and brass, for all the"
6709,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"bull-hide that covers it round about, the quivering spear-head smashes"
6710,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"it fair through and through, passes the guard of the corslet, and"
6711,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,pierces the breast with a gaping hole. He tears the warm weapon from the
6712,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,wound; in vain; together and at once life-blood and sense follow it. He
6713,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"falls heavily on the ground, his armour clashes over him, and his"
6714,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,bloodstained face sinks in death on the hostile soil. And Turnus
6715,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"standing over him . . .: 'Arcadians,' he cries, 'remember these my"
6716,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"words, and bear them to Evander. I send him back his Pallas as was due."
6717,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"All the meed of the tomb, all the solace of sepulture, I give freely."
6718,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Dearly must he pay his welcome to Aeneas.' And with these words,"
6719,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"planting his left foot on the dead, he tore away the broad heavy"
6720,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"sword-belt engraven with a tale of crime, the array of grooms foully"
6721,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"slain together on their bridal night, and the nuptial chambers dabbled"
6722,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"with blood, which Clonus, son of Eurytus, had wrought richly in gold."
6723,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Now Turnus exults in spoiling him of it, and rejoices at his prize. Ah"
6724,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"spirit of man, ignorant of fate and the allotted future, or to keep"
6725,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,bounds when elate with prosperity!--the day will [503-535]come when
6726,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Turnus shall desire to have bought Pallas' safety at a great ransom, and"
6727,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,curse the spoils of this fatal day. But with many moans and tears
6728,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,Pallas' comrades lay him on his shield and bear him away amid their
6729,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,ranks. O grief and glory and grace of the father to whom thou shalt
6730,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"return! This one day sent thee first to war, this one day takes thee"
6731,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"away, while yet thou leavest heaped high thy Rutulian dead."
6732,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,
6733,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"And now no rumour of the dreadful loss, but a surer messenger flies to"
6734,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Aeneas, telling him his troops are on the thin edge of doom; it is time"
6735,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"to succour the routed Teucrians. He mows down all that meets him, and"
6736,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"hews a broad path through their columns with furious sword, as he seeks"
6737,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"thee, O Turnus, in thy fresh pride of slaughter. Pallas, Evander, all"
6738,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,flash before his eyes; the board whereto but then he had first come a
6739,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"wanderer, and the clasped hands. Here four of Sulmo's children, as many"
6740,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"more of Ufens' nurture, are taken by him alive to slaughter in sacrifice"
6741,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"to the shade below, and slake the flames of the pyre with captive blood."
6742,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,Next he levelled his spear full on Magus from far. He stoops cunningly;
6743,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"the spear flies quivering over him; and, clasping his knees, he speaks"
6744,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"thus beseechingly: 'By thy father's ghost, by IÃ¼lus thy growing hope, I"
6745,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"entreat thee, save this life for a child and a parent. My house is"
6746,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,stately; deep in it lies buried wealth of engraven silver; I have masses
6747,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,of wrought and unwrought gold. The victory of Troy does not turn on
6748,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"this, nor will a single life make so great a difference.' He ended; to"
6749,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,him Aeneas thus returns answer: 'All the wealth of silver and gold thou
6750,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"tellest of, spare thou for thy children. Turnus hath broken off this thy"
6751,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"trafficking in war, even then when Pallas fell. Thus judges the ghost of"
6752,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"my father Anchises, thus IÃ¼lus.' So speaking, he grasps his helmet with"
6753,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"his left hand, and, bending back his neck, drives his [536-572]sword up"
6754,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"to the hilt in the suppliant. Hard by is Haemonides, priest of Phoebus"
6755,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"and Trivia, his temples wound with the holy ribboned chaplet, all"
6756,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"glittering in white-robed array. Him he meets and chases down the plain,"
6757,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"and, standing over his fallen foe, slaughters him and wraps him in great"
6758,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,darkness; Serestus gathers the armour and carries it away on his
6759,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"shoulders, a trophy, King Gradivus, to thee. Caeculus, born of Vulcan's"
6760,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"race, and Umbro, who comes from the Marsian hills, fill up the line. The"
6761,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Dardanian rushes full on them. His sword had hewn off Anxur's left arm,"
6762,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,with all the circle of the shield--he had uttered brave words and deemed
6763,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"his prowess would second his vaunts, and perchance with spirit lifted up"
6764,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,had promised himself hoar age and length of years--when Tarquitus in the
6765,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"pride of his glittering arms met his fiery course, whom the nymph Dryope"
6766,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"had borne to Faunus, haunter of the woodland. Drawing back his spear, he"
6767,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"pins the ponderous shield to the corslet; then, as he vainly pleaded and"
6768,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"would say many a thing, strikes his head to the ground, and, rolling"
6769,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"away the warm body, cries thus over his enemy: 'Lie there now, terrible"
6770,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"one! no mother's love shall lay thee in the sod, or place thy limbs"
6771,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"beneath thine heavy ancestral tomb. To birds of prey shalt thou be left,"
6772,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"or borne down sunk in the eddying water, where hungry fish shall suck"
6773,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"thy wounds.' Next he sweeps on Antaeus and Lucas, the first of Turnus'"
6774,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"train, and brave Numa and tawny-haired Camers, born of noble Volscens,"
6775,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"who was wealthiest in land of the Ausonians, and reigned in silent"
6776,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Amyclae. Even as Aegaeon, who, men say, had an hundred arms, an hundred"
6777,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"hands, fifty mouths and breasts ablaze with fire, and arrayed against"
6778,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Jove's thunders as many clashing shields and drawn swords: so Aeneas,"
6779,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"when once his sword's point grew warm, rages victorious over all the"
6780,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"field. Nay, lo! he darts full in face on Niphaeus' four-horse chariot;"
6781,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,before his long strides [573-608]and dreadful cry they turned in terror
6782,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"and dashed back, throwing out their driver and tearing the chariot down"
6783,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,the beach. Meanwhile the brothers Lucagus and Liger drive up with their
6784,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"pair of white horses. Lucagus valiantly waves his drawn sword, while his"
6785,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"brother wheels his horses with the rein. Aeneas, wrathful at their mad"
6786,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"onslaught, rushes on them, towering high with levelled spear. To him"
6787,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Liger . . . 'Not Diomede's horses dost thou discern, nor Achilles'"
6788,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"chariot, nor the plains of Phrygia: now on this soil of ours the war and"
6789,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,thy life shall end together.' Thus fly mad Liger's random words. But not
6790,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,in words does the Trojan hero frame his reply: for he hurls his javelin
6791,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"at the foe. As Lucagus spurred on his horses, bending forward over the"
6792,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"whip, with left foot advanced ready for battle, the spear passes through"
6793,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"the lower rim of his shining shield and pierces his left groin, knocks"
6794,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"him out of the chariot, and stretches him in death on the fields. To him"
6795,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"good Aeneas speaks in bitter words: 'Lucagus, no slackness in thy"
6796,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"coursers' flight hath betrayed thee, or vain shadow of the foe turned"
6797,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,them back; thyself thou leapest off the harnessed wheels.' In such wise
6798,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"he spoke, and caught the horses. His brother, slipping down from the"
6799,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"chariot, pitiably outstretched helpless hands: 'Ah, by the parents who"
6800,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"gave thee birth, great Trojan, spare this life and pity my prayer.' More"
6801,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,he was pleading; but Aeneas: 'Not such were the words thou wert
6802,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"uttering. Die, and be brother undivided from brother.' With that his"
6803,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,sword's point pierces the breast where the life lies hid. Thus the
6804,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Dardanian captain dealt death over the plain, like some raging torrent"
6805,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,stream or black whirlwind. At last the boy Ascanius and his troops burst
6806,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,through the ineffectual leaguer and issue from the camp.
6807,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,
6808,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,Meanwhile Jupiter breaks silence to accost Juno: 'O sister and wife best
6809,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"beloved, it is Venus, as thou deemedst, [609-639]nor is thy judgment"
6810,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"astray, who sustains the forces of Troy; not their own valour of hand in"
6811,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"war, and untamable spirit and endurance in peril.' To whom Juno"
6812,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,beseechingly:
6813,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,
6814,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"'Why, fair my lord, vexest thou one sick at heart and trembling at thy"
6815,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"bitter words? If that force were in my love that once was, and that was"
6816,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"well, never had thine omnipotence denied me leave to withdraw Turnus"
6817,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,from battle and preserve him for his father Daunus in safety. Now let
6818,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"him perish, and pay forfeit to the Trojans of his innocent blood. Yet he"
6819,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"traces his birth from our name, and Pilumnus was his father in the"
6820,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"fourth generation, and oft and again his bountiful hand hath heaped thy"
6821,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,courts with gifts.'
6822,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,
6823,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,To her the king of high heaven thus briefly spoke: 'If thy prayer for
6824,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"him is delay of present death and respite from his fall, and thou dost"
6825,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"understand that I ordain it thus, remove thy Turnus in flight, and"
6826,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,snatch him from the fate that is upon him. For so much indulgence there
6827,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"is room. But if any ampler grace mask itself in these thy prayers, and"
6828,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"thou dreamest of change in the whole movement of the war, idle is the"
6829,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,hope thou nursest.'
6830,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,
6831,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"And Juno, weeping: 'Ah yet, if thy mind were gracious where thy lips are"
6832,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"stern, and this gift of life might remain confirmed to Turnus! Now his"
6833,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"portion is bitter and guiltless death, or I wander idly from the truth."
6834,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Yet, oh that I rather deluded myself with false alarms, and thou who"
6835,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,canst wouldst bend thy course to better counsels.'
6836,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,
6837,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"These words uttered, she darted through the air straight from high"
6838,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"heaven, cloud-girt in driving tempest, and sought the Ilian ranks and"
6839,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"camp of Laurentum. Then the goddess, strange and ominous to see,"
6840,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,fashions into the likeness of Aeneas a thin and pithless shade of hollow
6841,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"mist, decks it with Dardanian weapons, and gives it the mimicry of"
6842,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"shield and divine helmet plume, gives unsubstantial [640-673]words and"
6843,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"senseless utterance, and the mould and motion of his tread: like shapes"
6844,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"rumoured to flit when death is past, or dreams that delude the"
6845,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,slumbering senses. But in front of the battle-ranks the phantom dances
6846,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"rejoicingly, and with arms and mocking accents provokes the foe. Turnus"
6847,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,hastens up and sends his spear whistling from far on it; it gives back
6848,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"and turns its footsteps. Then indeed Turnus, when he believed Aeneas"
6849,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"turned and fled from him, and his spirit madly drank in the illusive"
6850,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"hope: 'Whither fliest thou, Aeneas? forsake not thy plighted bridal"
6851,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,chamber. This hand shall give thee the land thou hast sought overseas.'
6852,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"So clamouring he pursues, and brandishes his drawn sword, and sees not"
6853,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,that his rejoicing is drifting with the winds. The ship lay haply moored
6854,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"to a high ledge of rock, with ladders run out and gangway ready, wherein"
6855,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,king Osinius sailed from the coasts of Clusium. Here the fluttering
6856,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,phantom of flying Aeneas darts and hides itself. Nor is Turnus slack to
6857,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,follow; he overleaps the barriers and springs across the high gangways.
6858,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,Scarcely had he lighted on the prow; the daughter of Saturn snaps the
6859,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"hawser, and the ship, parted from her cable, runs out on the ebbing"
6860,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"tide. And him Aeneas seeks for battle and finds not, and sends many a"
6861,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,man that meets him to death. Then the light phantom seeks not yet any
6862,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"further hiding-place, but, flitting aloft, melts in a dark cloud; and a"
6863,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,blast comes down meanwhile and sweeps Turnus through the seas. He looks
6864,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"back, witless of his case and thankless for his salvation, and, wailing,"
6865,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"stretches both hands to heaven: 'Father omnipotent, was I so guilty in"
6866,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"thine eyes, and is this the punishment thou hast ordained? Whither am I"
6867,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"borne? whence came I? what flight is this, or in what guise do I return?"
6868,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,Shall I look again on the camp or walls of Laurentum? What of that array
6869,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,of men who followed me to arms? whom--oh horrible!--I have abandoned all
6870,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,amid [674-707]a dreadful death; and now I see the stragglers and catch
6871,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,the groans of those who fall. What do I? or how may earth ever yawn for
6872,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"me deep enough? Do you rather, O winds, be pitiful, carry my bark on"
6873,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"rock or reef; it is I, Turnus, who desire and implore you; or drive me"
6874,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"on the cruel shoals of the Syrtis, where no Rutulian may follow nor"
6875,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"rumour know my name.' Thus speaking, he wavers in mind this way and"
6876,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"that: maddened by the shame, shall he plunge on his sword's harsh point"
6877,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"and drive it through his side, or fling himself among the waves, and"
6878,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"seek by swimming to gain the winding shore, again to return on the"
6879,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,Trojan arms? Thrice he essayed either way; thrice queenly Juno checked
6880,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"and restrained him in pity of heart. Cleaving the deep, he floats with"
6881,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"the tide down the flood, and is borne on to his father Daunus' ancient"
6882,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,city.
6883,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,
6884,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,But meanwhile at Jove's prompting fiery Mezentius takes his place in the
6885,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,battle and assails the triumphant Teucrians. The Tyrrhene ranks gather
6886,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"round him, and all at once in unison shower their darts down on the"
6887,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"hated foe. As a cliff that juts into the waste of waves, meeting the"
6888,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"raging winds and breasting the deep, endures all the threatening force"
6889,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"of sky and sea, itself fixed immovable, so he dashes to earth Hebrus son"
6890,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"of Dolichaon, and with him Latagus, and Palmus as he fled; catching"
6891,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Latagus full front in the face with a vast fragment of mountain rock,"
6892,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"while Palmus he hamstrings, and leaves him rolling helpless; his armour"
6893,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"he gives Lausus to wear on his shoulders, and the plumes to fix on his"
6894,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"crest. With them fall Evanthes the Phrygian, and Mimas, fellow and"
6895,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,birthmate of Paris; for on one night Theano bore him to his father
6896,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Amycus, and the queen, Cisseus' daughter, was delivered of Paris the"
6897,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,firebrand; he sleeps in his fathers' city; Mimas lies a stranger on the
6898,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,Laurentian coast. And as the boar driven by snapping hounds from the
6899,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"mountain heights, [708-744]many a year hidden by Vesulus in his pines,"
6900,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"many an one fed in the Laurentian marsh among the reedy forest, once"
6901,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"come among the nets, halts and snorts savagely, with shoulders bristling"
6902,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"up, and none of them dare be wrathful or draw closer, but they shower"
6903,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,from a safe distance their darts and cries; even thus none of those
6904,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,whose anger is righteous against Mezentius have courage to meet him with
6905,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"drawn weapon: far off they provoke him with missiles and huge clamour,"
6906,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"and he turns slow and fearless round about, grinding his teeth as he"
6907,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,shakes the spears off his shield. From the bounds of ancient Corythus
6908,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Acron the Greek had come, leaving for exile a bride half won. Seeing him"
6909,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"afar dealing confusion amid the ranks, in crimson plumes and his"
6910,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"plighted wife's purple,--as an unpastured lion often ranging the deep"
6911,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"coverts, for madness of hunger urges him, if he haply catches sight of a"
6912,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"timorous roe or high-antlered stag, he gapes hugely for joy, and, with"
6913,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"mane on end, clings crouching over its flesh, his cruel mouth bathed in"
6914,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,reeking gore. . . . so Mezentius darts lightly among the thick of the
6915,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"enemy. Hapless Acron goes down, and, spurning the dark ground, gasps out"
6916,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"his life, and covers the broken javelin with his blood. But the victor"
6917,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,deigned not to bring down Orodes with the blind wound of his flying
6918,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"lance as he fled; full face to face he meets him, and engages man with"
6919,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"man, conqueror not by stealth but armed valour. Then, as with planted"
6920,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"foot, he thrust him off the spear: 'O men,' he cries, 'Orodes lies low,"
6921,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,no slight arm of the war.' His comrades shout after him the glad battle
6922,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"chant. And the dying man: 'Not unavenged nor long, whoso thou art, shalt"
6923,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"thou be glad in victory: thee too an equal fate marks down, and in these"
6924,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"fields thou shalt soon lie.' And smiling on him half wrathfully,"
6925,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,Mezentius: 'Now die thou. But of me let the father of gods and king of
6926,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"men take counsel.' So saying, he drew the weapon out of his body."
6927,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,[745-780]Grim rest and iron slumber seal his eyes; his lids close on
6928,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"everlasting night. Caedicus slays AlcathoÃ¼s, Sacrator Hydaspes, Rapo"
6929,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Parthenius and the grim strength of Orses, Messapus Clonius and"
6930,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Erichaetes son of Lycaon, the one when his reinless horse stumbling had"
6931,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"flung him to the ground, the other as they met on foot. And Agis the"
6932,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Lycian advanced only to be struck from horseback by Valerus, brave as"
6933,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"his ancestry; and Thronius by Salius, and Salius by Nealces with"
6934,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,treacherous arrow-shot that stole from far.
6935,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,
6936,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,Now the heavy hand of war dealt equal woe and counterchange of death; in
6937,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,even balance conquerors and conquered slew and fell; nor one nor other
6938,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,knows of retreat. The gods in Jove's house pity the vain rage of either
6939,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"and all the agonising of mortals. From one side Venus, from one opposite"
6940,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Juno, daughter of Saturn, looks on; pale Tisiphone rages among the many"
6941,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"thousand men. But now, brandishing his huge spear, Mezentius strides"
6942,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"glooming over the plain, vast as Orion when, with planted foot, he"
6943,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,cleaves his way through the vast pools of mid-ocean and his shoulder
6944,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"overtops the waves, or carrying an ancient mountain-ash from the"
6945,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"hilltops, paces the ground and hides his head among the clouds: so moves"
6946,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Mezentius, huge in arms. Aeneas, espying him in the deep columns, makes"
6947,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"on to meet him. He remains, unterrified, awaiting his noble foe, steady"
6948,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"in his own bulk, and measures with his eye the fair range for a spear."
6949,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"'This right hand's divinity, and the weapon I poise and hurl, now be"
6950,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"favourable! thee, Lausus, I vow for the live trophy of Aeneas, dressed"
6951,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"in the spoils stripped from the pirate's body.' He ends, and throws the"
6952,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"spear whistling from far; it flies on, glancing from the shield, and"
6953,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"pierces illustrious Antores hard by him sidelong in the flank; Antores,"
6954,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"companion of Hercules, who, sent thither from Argos, had stayed by"
6955,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Evander, and [781-814]settled in an Italian town. Hapless he goes down"
6956,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"with a wound not his own, and in death gazes on the sky, and Argos is"
6957,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,sweet in his remembrance. Then good Aeneas throws his spear; through the
6958,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"sheltering circle of threefold brass, through the canvas lining and"
6959,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"fabric of triple-sewn bull-hide it went, and sank deep in his groin; yet"
6960,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"carried not its strength home. Quickly Aeneas, joyful at the sight of"
6961,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"the Tyrrhenian's blood, snatches his sword from his thigh and presses"
6962,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"hotly on his struggling enemy. Lausus saw, and groaned deeply for love"
6963,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"of his dear father, and tears rolled over his face. Here will I not keep"
6964,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,silence of thy hard death-doom and thine excellent deeds (if in any wise
6965,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"things wrought in the old time may win belief), nor of thyself, O fitly"
6966,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"remembered! He, helpless and trammelled, withdrew backward, the deadly"
6967,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,spear-shaft trailing from his shield. The youth broke forward and
6968,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,plunged into the fight; and even as Aeneas' hand rose to bring down the
6969,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"blow, he caught up his point and held him in delay. His comrades follow"
6970,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"up with loud cries, so the father may withdraw in shelter of his son's"
6971,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"shield, while they shower their darts and bear back the enemy with"
6972,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,missiles from a distance. Aeneas wrathfully keeps covered. And as when
6973,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"storm-clouds pour down in streaming hail, all the ploughmen and"
6974,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"country-folk scatter off the fields, and the wayfarer cowers safe in his"
6975,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"fortress, a stream's bank or deep arch of rock, while the rain falls,"
6976,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,that they may do their day's labour when sunlight reappears; thus under
6977,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,the circling storm of weapons Aeneas sustains the cloud of war till it
6978,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"thunders itself all away, and calls on Lausus, on Lausus, with chiding"
6979,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"and menace: 'Whither runnest thou on thy death, with daring beyond thy"
6980,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,strength? thine affection betrays thee into rashness.' But none the less
6981,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,he leaps madly on; and now wrath rises higher and fiercer in the
6982,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Dardanian captain, and the Fates pass Lausus' last [815-849]threads"
6983,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,through their hand; for Aeneas drives the sword strongly right through
6984,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,him up all its length: the point pierced the light shield that armed his
6985,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"assailant, and the tunic sewn by his mother with flexible gold: blood"
6986,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"filled his breast, and the life left the body and passed mourning"
6987,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,through the air to the under world. But when Anchises' son saw the look
6988,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"on the dying face, the face pale in wonderful wise, he sighed deeply in"
6989,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"pity, and reached forth his hand, as the likeness of his own filial"
6990,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,affection flashed across his soul. 'What now shall good Aeneas give
6991,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"thee, what, O poor boy, for this thy praise, for guerdon of a nature so"
6992,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,noble? Keep for thine own the armour thou didst delight in; and I
6993,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"restore thee, if that matters aught at all, to the ghosts and ashes of"
6994,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"thy parents. Yet thou shalt have this sad comfort in thy piteous death,"
6995,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"thou fallest by great Aeneas' hand.' Then, chiding his hesitating"
6996,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"comrades, he lifts him from the ground, dabbling the comely-ranged"
6997,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,tresses with blood.
6998,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,
6999,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Meanwhile his father, by the wave of the Tiber river, stanched his wound"
7000,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"with water, and rested his body against a tree-trunk. Hard by his brazen"
7001,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"helmet hangs from the boughs, and the heavy armour lies quietly on the"
7002,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"meadow. Chosen men stand round; he, sick and panting, leans his neck and"
7003,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,lets his beard spread down over his chest. Many a time he asks for
7004,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Lausus, and sends many an one to call him back and carry a parent's sad"
7005,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,commands. But Lausus his weeping comrades were bearing lifeless on his
7006,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"armour, mighty and mightily wounded to death. Afar the soul prophetic of"
7007,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,ill knew their lamentation: he soils his gray hairs plenteously with
7008,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"dust, and stretches both hands on high, and clings on the dead. 'Was"
7009,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"life's hold on me so sweet, O my son, that I let him I bore receive the"
7010,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"hostile stroke in my room? Am I, thy father, saved by these wounds of"
7011,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"thine, and living by thy death? Alas and woe! [850-885]now at last"
7012,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"exile is bitter! now the wound is driven deep! And I, even I, O my son,"
7013,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"stained thy name with crime, driven in hatred from the throne and"
7014,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,sceptre of my fathers. I owed vengeance to my country and my people's
7015,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,resentment; might mine own guilty life but have paid it by every form of
7016,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"death! Now I live, and leave not yet man and day; but I will.' As he"
7017,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"speaks thus he raises himself painfully on his thigh, and though the"
7018,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"violence of the deep wound cripples him, yet unbroken he bids his horse"
7019,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"be brought, his beauty, his comfort, that ever had carried him"
7020,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"victorious out of war, and says these words to the grieving beast:"
7021,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"'Rhoebus, we have lived long, if aught at all lasts long with mortals."
7022,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,This day wilt thou either bring back in triumph the gory head and spoils
7023,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"of Aeneas, and we will avenge Lausus' agonies; or if no force opens a"
7024,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"way, thou wilt die with me: for I deem not, bravest, thou wilt deign to"
7025,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"bear an alien rule and a Teucrian lord.' He spoke, and took his welcome"
7026,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"seat on the back he knew, loading both hands with keen javelins, his"
7027,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,head sheathed in glittering brass and shaggy horse-hair plumes. Thus he
7028,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,galloped in. Through his heart sweep together the vast tides of shame
7029,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,and mingling madness and grief. And with that he thrice loudly calls
7030,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Aeneas. Aeneas knew the call, and makes glad invocation: 'So the father"
7031,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"of gods speed me, so Apollo on high: do thou essay to close hand to"
7032,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"hand. . . .' Thus much he utters, and moves up to meet him with levelled"
7033,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"spear. And he: 'Why seek to frighten me, fierce man, now my son is gone?"
7034,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"this was thy one road to my ruin. We shrink not from death, nor relent"
7035,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"before any of thy gods. Cease; for I come to my death, first carrying"
7036,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"these gifts for thee.' He spoke, and hurled a weapon at his enemy; then"
7037,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,plants another and yet another as he darts round in a wide circle; but
7038,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,they are stayed on the boss of gold. Thrice he rode wheeling close round
7039,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"him by the [886-908]left, and sent his weapons strongly in; thrice the"
7040,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Trojan hero turns round, taking the grim forest on his brazen guard."
7041,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Then, weary of lingering in delay on delay, and plucking out spear-head"
7042,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"after spear-head, and hard pressed in the uneven match of battle, with"
7043,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"much counselling of spirit now at last he bursts forth, and sends his"
7044,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,spear at the war-horse between the hollows of the temples. The creature
7045,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"raises itself erect, beating the air with its feet, throws its rider,"
7046,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"and coming down after him in an entangled mass, slips its shoulder as it"
7047,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,tumbles forward. The cries of Trojans and Latins kindle the sky. Aeneas
7048,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"rushes up, drawing his sword from the scabbard, and thus above him:"
7049,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,'Where now is gallant Mezentius and all his fierce spirit?' Thereto the
7050,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"Tyrrhenian, as he came to himself and gazing up drank the air of heaven:"
7051,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"'Bitter foe, why these taunts and menaces of death? Naught forbids my"
7052,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"slaughter; neither on such terms came I to battle, nor did my Lausus"
7053,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"make treaty for this between me and thee. This one thing I beseech thee,"
7054,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,by whatsoever grace a vanquished enemy may claim: allow my body
7055,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"sepulture. I know I am girt by the bitter hatred of my people. Stay, I"
7056,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"implore, their fury, and grant me and my son union in the tomb.' So"
7057,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,"speaks he, and takes the sword in his throat unfalteringly, and the"
7058,THE BATTLE ON THE BEACH,lifeblood spreads in a wave over his armour.

7072,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","lopped away on every hand, and arrays it in the gleaming arms stripped"
7073,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","from Mezentius the captain, a trophy to thee, mighty Lord of War; he"

7076,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","on his left hand, and hangs from his neck the ivory sword. Then among"
7077,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",his joyous comrades (for all the throng of his captains girt him close
7078,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",about) he begins in these words of cheer:
7079,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",
7080,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","'The greatest deed is done, O men; be all fear gone for what remains."
7081,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","These are the spoils of a haughty king, the first-fruits won from him;"
7082,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",my hands have set Mezentius here. Now our way lies to the walls of the
7083,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Latin king. Prepare your arms in courage, and let your hopes anticipate"
7084,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",the war; let no ignorant delay hinder or tardy thoughts of fear keep us
7085,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","back, so soon as heaven grant us to pluck up the standards and lead our"
7086,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",army from the camp. [22-58]Meanwhile let us commit to earth the
7087,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","unburied bodies of our comrades, since deep in Acheron this honour is"
7088,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","left alone. Go,' says he, 'grace with the last gifts those noble souls"
7089,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",whose blood won us this land for ours; and first let Pallas be sent to
7090,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Evander's mourning city, he whose valour failed not when the day of"
7091,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","darkness took him, and the bitter wave of death.'"
7092,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",
7093,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","So speaks he weeping, and retraces his steps to the door, where aged"
7094,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",Acoetes watched Pallas' lifeless body laid out for burial; once
7095,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","armour-bearer to Evander in Parrhasia, but now gone forth with darker"
7096,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","omens, appointed attendant to his darling foster-child. Around is the"
7097,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","whole train of servants, with a crowd of Trojans, and the Ilian women"
7098,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",with hair unbound in mourning after their fashion. When Aeneas entered
7099,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","at the high doorway they beat their breasts and raise a loud wail aloft,"
7100,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","and the palace moans to their grievous lamentation. Himself, when he saw"
7101,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","the pillowed head and fair face of Pallas, and on his smooth breast the"
7102,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","gaping wound of the Ausonian spear-head, speaks thus with welling tears:"
7103,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",
7104,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","'Did Fortune in her joyous coming,' he cries, 'O luckless boy, grudge"

7107,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","departure, when he embraced me as I went and bade me speed to a wide"
7108,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","empire, and yet warned me in fear that the men were valiant, the people"
7109,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","obstinate in battle. And now he, fast ensnared by empty hope, perchance"
7110,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","offers vows and heaps gifts on his altars; we, a mourning train, go in"
7111,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","hollow honour by his corpse, who now owes no more to aught in heaven."
7112,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",Unhappy! thou wilt see thy son cruelly slain; is this our triumphal

7114,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","lost, mine IÃ¼lus, to Ausonia and to thee!'"
7115,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",
7116,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","[59-96]This lament done, he bids raise the piteous body, and sends a"
7117,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","thousand men chosen from all his army for the last honour of escort, to"
7118,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","mingle in the father's tears; a small comfort in a great sorrow, yet the"
7119,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",unhappy parent's due. Others quickly plait a soft wicker bier of arbutus
7120,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","rods and oak shoots, and shadow the heaped pillows with a leafy"
7121,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","covering. Here they lay him, high on their rustic strewing; even as some"
7122,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","tender violet or drooping hyacinth-blossom plucked by a maiden's finger,"
7123,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","whose sheen and whose grace is not yet departed, but no more does Earth"
7124,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",the mother feed it or lend it strength. Then Aeneas bore forth two
7125,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","purple garments stiff with gold, that Sidonian Dido's own hands, happy"
7126,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","over their work, had once wrought for him, and shot the warp with"
7127,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","delicate gold. One of these he sadly folds round him, a last honour, and"
7128,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",veils in its covering the tresses destined to the fire; and heaps up
7129,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","besides many a Laurentine battle-prize, and bids his spoils pass forth"
7130,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",in long train; with them the horses and arms whereof he had stripped the
7131,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","enemy, and those, with hands tied behind their back, whom he would send"
7132,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","as nether offering to his ghost, and sprinkle the blood of their slaying"
7133,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",on the flame. Also he bids his captains carry stems dressed in the
7134,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","armour of the foe, and fix on them the hostile names. Unhappy Acoetes is"
7135,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","led along, outworn with age, he smites his breast and rends his face,"
7136,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",and flings himself forward all along the ground. Likewise they lead
7137,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",forth the chariot bathed in Rutulian blood; behind goes weeping Aethon
7138,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","the war-horse, his trappings laid away, and big drops wet his face."
7139,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Others bear his spear and helmet, for all else is Turnus' prize. Then"
7140,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","follow in mourning array the Teucrians and all the Tyrrhenians, and the"
7141,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",Arcadians with arms reversed. When the whole long escorting file had
7142,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","taken its way, Aeneas stopped, and sighing deep, pursued thus: 'Once"
7143,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",again war's dreadful destiny calls us hence to other tears:
7144,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","[97-129]hail thou for evermore, O princely Pallas, and for evermore"
7145,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",farewell.' And without more words he bent his way to the high walls and
7146,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",advanced towards his camp.
7147,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",
7148,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",And now envoys were there from the Latin city with wreathed boughs of
7149,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","olive, praying him of his grace to restore the dead that lay strewn by"
7150,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","the sword over the plain, and let them go to their earthy grave: no war"
7151,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",lasts with men conquered and bereft of breath; let this indulgence be
7152,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",given to men once called friends and fathers of their brides. To them
7153,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Aeneas grants leave in kind and courteous wise, spurning not their"
7154,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","prayer, and goes on in these words: 'What spite of fortune, O Latins,"
7155,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","hath entangled you in the toils of war, and made you fly our friendship?"
7156,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",Plead you for peace to the lifeless bodies that the battle-lot hath
7157,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",slain? I would fain grant it even to the living. Neither have I come but
7158,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",because destiny had given me this place to dwell in; nor wage I war with
7159,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",your people; your king it is who hath broken our covenant and preferred
7160,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",to trust himself to Turnus' arms. Fitter it were Turnus had faced death
7161,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","to-day. If he will fight out the war and expel the Teucrians, it had"
7162,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",been well to meet me here in arms; so had he lived to whom life were
7163,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","granted of heaven or his own right hand. Now go, and kindle the fire"
7164,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",beneath your hapless countrymen.' Aeneas ended: they stood dumb in
7165,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","silence, with faces bent steadfastly in mutual gaze. Then aged Drances,"
7166,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","ever young Turnus' assailant in hatred and accusation, with the words of"
7167,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",his mouth thus answers him again:
7168,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",
7169,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","'O Trojan, great in renown, yet greater in arms, with what praises may I"
7170,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","extol thy divine goodness? Shall thy righteousness first wake my wonder,"
7171,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",or thy toils in war? We indeed will gratefully carry these words to our

7173,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","King Latinus. Let Turnus seek his own alliances. Nay, [130-163]it will"
7174,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",be our delight to rear the massy walls of destiny and stoop our
7175,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",shoulders under the stones of Troy.'
7176,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",
7177,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","He ended thus, and all with one voice murmured assent. Twelve days'"
7178,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","truce is struck, and in mediation of the peace Teucrians and Latins"
7179,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",stray mingling unharmed on the forest heights. The tall ash echoes to
7180,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","the axe's strokes; they overturn pines that soar into the sky, and"
7181,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","busily cleave oaken logs and scented cedar with wedges, and drag"
7182,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",mountain-ashes on their groaning waggons.
7183,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",
7184,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","And now flying Rumour, harbinger of the heavy woe, fills Evander and"

7187,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",funeral torches after their ancient use; the road gleams with the long
7188,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","line of flame, and parts the fields with a broad pathway of light; the"
7189,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",arriving crowd of Phrygians meets them and mingles in mourning array.
7190,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",When the matrons saw all the train approach their dwellings they kindle
7191,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",the town with loud wailing. But no force may withhold Evander; he comes
7192,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","amid them; the bier is set down; he flings himself on Pallas, and clasps"
7193,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","him with tears and sighs, and scarcely at last does grief leave his"
7194,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","voice's utterance free. 'Other than this, O Pallas! was thy promise to"
7195,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","thy father, that thou wouldst not plunge recklessly into the fury of"
7196,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",battle. I knew well how strong was the fresh pride of arms and the
7197,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","sweetness of honour in a first battle. Ah, unhappy first-fruits of his"
7198,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","youth and bitter prelude of the war upon our borders! ah, vows and"
7199,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","prayers of mine that no god heard! and thou, pure crown of wifehood,"
7200,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",happy that thou art dead and not spared for this sorrow! But I have
7201,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","outgone my destiny in living, to stay here the survivor of my child."
7202,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Would I had followed the allied arms of Troy, to be overwhelmed by"

7204,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","were borne home in this [164-198]procession! I would not blame you, O"
7205,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Teucrians, nor our treaty and the friendly hands we clasped: our old age"

7208,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","slew his Volscian thousands before he fell. Nay, no other funeral than"
7209,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","this would I deem thy due, my Pallas, than good Aeneas does, than the"

7214,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","unhappy, do I delay the Trojan arms? Go, and forget not to carry this"

7220,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",
7221,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Meanwhile Dawn had raised her gracious light on weary men, bringing back"
7222,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","task and toil: now lord Aeneas, now Tarchon, have built the pyres on the"
7223,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",winding shore. Hither in ancestral fashion hath each borne the bodies of
7224,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","his kin; the dark fire is lit beneath, and the vapour hides high heaven"
7225,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","in gloom. Thrice, girt in glittering arms, they have marched about the"
7226,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","blazing piles, thrice compassed on horseback the sad fire of death, and"
7227,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",uttered their wail. Tears fall fast upon earth and armour; cries of men
7228,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",and blare of trumpets roll skyward. Then some fling on the fire Latin
7229,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","spoils stripped from the slain, helmets and shapely swords, bridles and"
7230,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","glowing chariot wheels; others familiar gifts, the very shields and"
7231,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",luckless weapons of the dead. Around are slain in sacrifice oxen many in

7233,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","[199-234]are slaughtered over the flames. Then, crowding the shore,"
7234,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","they gaze on their burning comrades, and guard the embers of the pyres,"
7235,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",and cannot tear themselves away till dewy Night wheels on the
7236,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",star-spangled glittering sky.
7237,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",
7238,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",Therewithal the unhappy Latins far apart build countless pyres and bury

7240,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","to the neighbouring country, or send them back to the city; the rest, a"
7241,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","vast heap of undistinguishable slaughter, they burn uncounted and"
7242,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",unhonoured; on all sides the broad fields gleam with crowded rivalry of
7243,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",fires. The third Dawn had rolled away the chill shadow from the sky;
7244,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","mournfully they piled high the ashes and mingled bones from the embers,"
7245,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",and heaped a load of warm earth above them. Now in the dwellings of rich
7246,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",Latinus' city the noise is loudest and most the long wail. Here mothers
7247,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","and their sons' unhappy brides, here beloved sisters sad-hearted and"
7248,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","orphaned boys curse the disastrous war and Turnus' bridal, and bid him"
7249,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","his own self arm and decide the issue with the sword, since he claims"
7250,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",for himself the first rank and the lordship of Italy. Drances fiercely
7251,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","embitters their cry, and vouches that Turnus alone is called, alone is"
7252,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",claimed for battle. Yet therewith many a diverse-worded counsel is for
7253,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Turnus, and the great name of the queen overshadows him, and he rises"
7254,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",high in renown of trophies fitly won.
7255,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",
7256,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Among their stir, and while confusion is fiercest, lo! to crown all, the"
7257,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",envoys from great Diomede's city bring their gloomy message: nothing is

7259,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","entreaties have been of no avail; Latium must seek other arms, or sue"
7260,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",for peace to the Trojan king. For heavy grief King Latinus himself
7261,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",swoons away. The wrath of heaven and the fresh graves before his eyes
7262,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",warn him that Aeneas is borne on by fate's evident will. So he sends
7263,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","imperial summons to [235-269]his high council, the foremost of his"
7264,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","people, and gathers them within his lofty courts. They assemble, and"
7265,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","stream up the crowded streets to the royal dwelling. Latinus, eldest in"
7266,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","years and first in royalty, sits amid them with cheerless brow, and bids"
7267,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","the envoys sent back from the Aetolian city tell the news they bring,"
7268,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",and demands a full and ordered reply. Then tongues are hushed; and
7269,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Venulus, obeying his word, thus begins to speak:"
7270,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",
7271,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","'We have seen, O citizens, Diomede in his Argive camp, and outsped our"

7274,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","ancestral people, on the conquered fields of Iapygian Garganus. After we"
7275,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","entered in, and licence of open speech was given, we lay forth our"
7276,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","gifts, we instruct him of our name and country, who are its invaders,"
7277,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","and why we are drawn to Arpi. He heard us, and replied thus with face"
7278,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",unstirred:

7280,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","'""O fortunate races, realm of Saturn, Ausonians of old, how doth fortune"

7299,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","I madly assailed celestial limbs with steel, and sullied the hand of"
7300,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Venus with a wound. Do not, ah, do not urge me to such battles. Neither"

7302,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",remember with delight the woes of old. Turn to Aeneas with the gifts you
7303,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",bear to me from your ancestral borders. We have stood to face his grim
7304,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","weapons, and met him hand to hand; believe one who hath proved it, how"
7305,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","mightily he rises over his shield, in what a whirlwind he hurls his"

7337,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","and Rutulians sow on it, work the stiff hills with the ploughshare, and"

7375,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","peril so evident, O source and spring of Latium's woes? In war is no"
7376,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","safety; peace we all implore of thee, O Turnus, and the one pledge that"
7377,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","makes peace inviolable. I the first, I whom thou picturest thine enemy,"
7378,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","as I care not if I am, see, I bow at thy feet. Pity thine allies;"
7379,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","relent, and retire before thy conqueror. Enough have we seen of rout and"
7380,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","death, and desolation over our broad lands. Or if glory stir thee, if"
7381,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","such strength kindle in thy breast, and if a palace so delight thee for"
7382,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","thy dower, be bold, and advance stout-hearted upon the foe. We verily,"
7383,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","that Turnus [371-406]may have his royal bride, must lie scattered on"
7384,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","the plains, worthless lives, a crowd unburied and unwept. Do thou also,"
7385,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","if thou hast aught of might, if the War-god be in thee as in thy"
7386,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","fathers, look him in the face who challenges. . . .'"
7387,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",
7388,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","At these words Turnus' passion blazed out. He utters a groan, and breaks"
7389,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",forth thus in deep accents:
7390,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",
7391,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","'Copious indeed, Drances, and fluent is ever thy speech at the moment"
7392,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",war calls for action; and when the fathers are summoned thou art there
7393,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","the first. But we need no words to fill our senate-house, safely as thou"
7394,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","wingest them while the mounded walls keep off the enemy, and the"
7395,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","trenches swim not yet with blood. Thunder on in rhetoric, thy wonted"
7396,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","way: accuse thou me of fear, Drances, since thine hand hath heaped so"
7397,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","many Teucrians in slaughter, and thy glorious trophies dot the fields."
7398,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",Trial is open of what live valour can do; nor indeed is our foe far to
7399,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",seek; on all sides they surround our walls. Are we going to meet them?
7400,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",Why linger? Will thy bravery ever be in that windy tongue and those
7401,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",timorous feet of thine? . . . _My conqueror?_ Shall any justly flout me
7402,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","as conquered, who sees Tiber swoln fuller with Ilian blood, and all the"
7403,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","house and people of Evander laid low, and the Arcadians stripped of"
7404,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","their armour? Not such did Bitias and huge Pandarus prove me, and the"
7405,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","thousand men whom on one day my conquering hand sent down to hell, shut"
7406,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",as I was in their walls and closed in the enemy's ramparts. _In war is
7407,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",no safety._ Fool! be thy boding on the Dardanian's head and thine own
7408,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","fortunes. Go on; cease not to throw all into confusion with thy terrors,"
7409,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","to exalt the strength of a twice vanquished race, and abase the arms of"
7410,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",Latinus before it. Now the princes of the Myrmidons tremble before
7411,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Phrygian arms, now Tydeus' son and Achilles of Larissa, and Aufidus"
7412,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",river recoils from the Adriatic wave. Or when the scheming villain
7413,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","[407-443]pretends to shrink at my abuse, and sharpens calumny by"
7414,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",terror! never shall this hand--keep quiet!--rob thee of such a soul;
7415,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","with thee let it abide, and dwell in that breast of thine. Now I return"
7416,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","to thee, my lord, and thy weighty resolves. If thou dost repose no"
7417,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","further hope in our arms, if all hath indeed left us, and one repulse"
7418,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","been our utter ruin, and our fortune is beyond recovery, let us plead"
7419,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",for peace and stretch forth unarmed hands. Yet ah! had we aught of our
7420,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","wonted manhood, his toil beyond all other is blessed and his spirit"
7421,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","eminent, who rather than see it thus, hath fallen prone in death and"
7422,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",once bitten the ground. But if we have yet resources and an army still
7423,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","unbroken, and cities and peoples of Italy remain for our aid; but if"
7424,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",even the Trojans have won their glory at great cost of blood (they too
7425,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","have their deaths, and the storm fell equally on all), why do we"
7426,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",shamefully faint even on the threshold? Why does a shudder seize our
7427,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",limbs before the trumpet sound? Often do the Days and the varying change
7428,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",of toiling Time restore prosperity; often Fortune in broken visits makes
7429,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",man her sport and again establishes him. The Aetolian of Arpi will not
7430,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","help us; but Messapus will, and Tolumnius the fortunate, and the"
7431,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",captains sent by many a nation; nor will fame be scant to follow the
7432,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",flower of Latium and the Laurentine land. Camilla the Volscian too is
7433,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","with us, leading her train of cavalry, squadrons splendid in brass. But"
7434,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","if I only am claimed by the Teucrians for combat, if that is your"
7435,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","pleasure, and I am the barrier to the public good, Victory does not so"
7436,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",hate and shun my hands that I should renounce any enterprise for so
7437,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","great a hope. I shall meet him in courage, did he outmatch great"
7438,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",Achilles and wear arms like his forged by Vulcan's hands. To you and to
7439,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","my father Latinus I Turnus, unexcelled in bravery by any of old,"
7440,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","consecrate my life. _Aeneas calls on him alone_: let him, I implore: let"
7441,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","not Drances rather appease with his [444-480]life this wrath of heaven,"
7442,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","if such it be, or win the renown of valour.'"
7443,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",
7444,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",Thus they one with another strove together in uncertainty; Aeneas moved
7445,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","from his camp to battle. Lo, a messenger rushes spreading confusion"
7446,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","through the royal house, and fills the town with great alarms: the"
7447,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Teucrians, ranged in battle-line with the Tyrrhene forces, are marching"
7448,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",down by the Tiber river and filling the plain. Immediately spirits are
7449,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",stirred and hearts shaken and wrath roused in fierce excitement among
7450,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",the crowd. Hurrying hands grasp at arms; for arms their young men
7451,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",clamour; the fathers shed tears and mutter gloomily. With that a great
7452,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","noise rises aloft in diverse contention, even as when flocks of birds"
7453,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","haply settle on a lofty grove, or swans utter their hoarse cry among the"
7454,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","vocal pools on the fish-filled river of Padusa. 'Yes, citizens!' cries"
7455,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Turnus, seizing his time: 'gather in council and sit praising peace,"
7456,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",while they rush on dominion in arms!' Without more words he sprung up
7457,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","and issued swiftly from the high halls. 'Thou, Volusus,' he cries, 'bid"
7458,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","the Volscian battalions arm, and lead out the Rutulians. Messapus, and"
7459,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Coras with thy brother, spread your armed cavalry widely over the plain."
7460,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",Let a division entrench the city gates and man the towers: the rest of
7461,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",our array attack with me where I command.' The whole town goes rushing
7462,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","to the walls; lord Latinus himself, dismayed by the woeful emergency,"
7463,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","quits the council and puts off his high designs, and chides himself"
7464,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","sorely for not having given Aeneas unasked welcome, and made him son and"
7465,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","bulwark of the city. Some entrench the gates, or bring up supply of"
7466,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",stones and poles. The hoarse clarion utters the ensanguined note of war.
7467,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",A motley ring of boys and matrons girdle the walls. Therewithal the
7468,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",queen with a crowd of mothers ascends bearing gifts to Pallas' towered
7469,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","temple, and by her side goes maiden Lavinia, source of all that woe,"
7470,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","[481-514]her beautiful eyes cast down. The mothers enter in, and while"
7471,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","the temple steams with their incense, pour from the high doorway their"
7472,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","mournful cry: 'Maiden armipotent, Tritonian, sovereign of war, break"
7473,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","with thine hand the spear of the Phrygian plunderer, hurl him prone to"
7474,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",earth and dash him down beneath our lofty gates.' Turnus arrays himself
7475,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","in hot haste for battle, and even now hath done on his sparkling"
7476,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","breastplate with its flickering scales of brass, and clasped his golden"
7477,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","greaves, his brows yet bare and his sword buckled to his side; he runs"
7478,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","down from the fortress height glittering in gold, and exultantly"
7479,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","anticipates the foe. Thus when a horse snaps his tether, and, free at"
7480,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","last, rushes from the stalls and gains the open plain, he either darts"
7481,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","towards the pastures of the herded mares, or bathing, as is his wont, in"
7482,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","the familiar river waters, dashes out and neighs with neck stretched"
7483,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","high, glorying, and his mane tosses over collar and shoulder. Camilla"
7484,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",with her Volscian array meets him face to face in the gateway; the
7485,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","princess leaps from her horse, and all her squadron at her example slide"
7486,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",from horseback to the ground. Then she speaks thus:
7487,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",
7488,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","'Turnus, if bravery hath any just self-confidence, I dare and promise to"
7489,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","engage Aeneas' cavalry, and advance to meet the Tyrrhene horse. Permit"
7490,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",my hand to try war's first perils: do thou on foot keep by the walls and
7491,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",guard the city.'
7492,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",
7493,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","To this Turnus, with eyes fixed on the terrible maiden: 'O maiden flower"
7494,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","of Italy, how may I essay to express, how to prove my gratitude? But"
7495,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","now, since that spirit of thine excels all praise, share thou the toil"
7496,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","with me. Aeneas, as the report of the scouts I sent assures, hath sent"
7497,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",on his light-armed horse to annoy us and scour the plains; himself he
7498,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",marches on the city across the lonely ridge of the mountain steep. I am
7499,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",arranging a stratagem of [515-550]war in his pathway on the wooded
7500,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","slope, to block a gorge on the highroad with armed troops. Do thou"
7501,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",receive and join battle with the Tyrrhene cavalry; with thee shall be
7502,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","gallant Messapus, the Latin squadrons, and Tiburtus' division: do thou"
7503,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",likewise assume a captain's charge.'
7504,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",
7505,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","So speaks he, and with like words heartens Messapus and the allied"
7506,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","captains to battle, and advances towards the enemy. There is a sweeping"
7507,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","curve of glen, made for ambushes and devices of arms. Dark thick foliage"
7508,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","hems it in on either hand, and into it a bare footpath leads by a narrow"
7509,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",gorge and difficult entrance. Right above it on the watch-towers of the
7510,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","hill-top lies an unexpected level, hidden away in shelter, whether one"
7511,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",would charge from right and left or stand on the ridge and roll down
7512,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","heavy stones. Hither he passes by a line of way he knew, and, seizing"
7513,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","his ground, occupies the treacherous woods."
7514,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",
7515,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",Meanwhile in the heavenly dwellings Latona's daughter addressed fleet
7516,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Opis, one of her maiden fellowship and sacred band, and sadly uttered"
7517,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","these accents: 'Camilla moves to fierce war, O maiden, and vainly girds"
7518,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","on our arms, dear as she is beyond others to me. For her love of Diana"
7519,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","is not newly born, nor her spirit stirred by sudden affection. Driven"
7520,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","from his kingdom through jealousy of his haughty power, Metabus left"
7521,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","ancient Privernum town, and bore his infant with him in his flight"
7522,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","through war and battle, the companion of his exile, and called her by"
7523,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","her mother Casmilla's name, with a little change, Camilla. Carrying her"
7524,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","before him on his breast, he sought a long ridge of lonely woodland; on"
7525,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","all sides angry weapons pressed on him, and Volscian soldiery spread"
7526,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","hurrying round about. Lo, in mid flight swoln Amasenus ran foaming with"
7527,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","banks abrim, so heavily had the clouds burst in rain. He would swim it;"
7528,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",but love of the infant holds him back in alarm for so dear a burden.
7529,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Inly revolving [551-586]all, he settled reluctantly on a sudden"
7530,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",resolve: the great spear that the warrior haply carried in his stout
7531,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","hand, of hard-knotted and seasoned oak, to it he ties his daughter"
7532,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","swathed in cork-tree bark of the woodland, and binds her balanced round"
7533,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",the middle of the spear; poising it in his great right hand he thus
7534,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","cries aloft: ""Gracious one, haunter of the woodland, maiden daughter of"
7535,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Latona, a father devotes this babe to thy service; thine is this weapon"
7536,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","she holds, thine infant suppliant, flying through the air from her"
7537,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","enemies. Accept her, I implore, O goddess, for thine own, whom now I"
7538,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","entrust to the chance of air."" He spoke, and drawing back his arm, darts"
7539,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",the spinning spear-shaft: the waters roar: over the racing river poor
7540,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Camilla shoots on the whistling weapon. But Metabus, as a strong band"
7541,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","now presses nigher, plunges into the river, and triumphantly pulls spear"
7542,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","and girl, his gift to Trivia, from the grassy turf. No cities ever"
7543,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","received him within house or rampart, nor had his savagery submitted to"
7544,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",it; he led his life on the lonely pastoral hills. Here he nursed his
7545,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","daughter in the underwood among tangled coverts, on the milk of a wild"
7546,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","brood-mare's teats, squeezing the udder into her tender lips. And so"
7547,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","soon as the baby stood and went straight on her feet, he armed her hands"
7548,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","with a sharp javelin, and hung quiver and bow from her little shoulders."
7549,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Instead of gold to clasp her tresses, instead of the long skirted gown,"
7550,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",a tiger's spoils hang down her back. Even then her tender hand hurled
7551,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","childish darts, and whirled about her head the twisted thong of her"
7552,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","sling, and struck down the crane from Strymon or the milk-white swan."
7553,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",Many a mother among Tyrrhenian towns destined her for their sons in
7554,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","vain; content with Diana alone, she keeps unsoiled for ever the love of"
7555,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",her darts and maidenhood. Would she had not plunged thus into warfare
7556,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",and provoked the Trojans by attack! so were she now dear to me and one
7557,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","of my [587-620]company. But since bitter doom is upon her, up, glide"
7558,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","from heaven, O Nymph, and seek the Latin borders, where under evil omen"
7559,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","they join in baleful battle. Take these, and draw from the quiver an"
7560,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","avenging shaft; by it shall he pay me forfeit of his blood, whoso,"
7561,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Trojan or Italian alike, shall sully her sacred body with a wound."
7562,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",Thereafter will I in a sheltering cloud bear body and armour of the
7563,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","hapless girl unspoiled to the tomb, and lay them in her native land.'"
7564,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","She spoke; but the other sped lightly down the aery sky, girt about with"
7565,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",dark whirlwind on her echoing way.
7566,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",
7567,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","But meanwhile the Trojan force nears the walls, with the Etruscan"
7568,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",captains and their whole cavalry arrayed in ordered squadrons. Their
7569,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","horses' trampling hoofs thunder on all the field, as, swerving this way"
7570,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","and that, they chafe at the reins' pressure; the iron field bristles"
7571,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","wide with spears, and the plain is aflame with uplifted arms. Likewise"
7572,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Messapus and the Latin horse, and Coras and his brother, and maiden"
7573,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Camilla's squadron, come forth against them on the plain, and draw back"

7575,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",fire of neighing horses and advancing men. And now each had drawn within
7576,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","javelin-cast of each, and drew up; with a sudden shout they dart forth,"
7577,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",and urge on their furious horses; from all sides at once weapons shower
7578,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","thick like snow, and veil the sky with their shadow. In a moment"
7579,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Tyrrhenus and fiery Aconteus charge violently with crossing spears, and"
7580,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","are the first to fall; they go down with a heavy crash, and their beasts"
7581,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","break and shatter chest upon chest. Aconteus, hurled off like a"
7582,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","thunderbolt or some mass slung from an engine, is dashed away, and"
7583,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","scatters his life in air. Immediately the lines waver, and the Latins"
7584,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",wheeling about throw their shields behind them and turn their horses
7585,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",towards the town. The Trojans pursue; Asilas heads and leads on
7586,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","[621-653]their squadrons. And now they drew nigh the gates, and again"
7587,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",the Latins raise a shout and wheel their supple necks about; the
7588,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","pursuers fly, and gallop right back with loosened rein: as when the sea,"
7589,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","running up in ebb and flow, now rushes shoreward and strikes over the"
7590,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","cliffs in a wave of foam, drenching the edge of the sand in its curving"
7591,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","sweep; now runs swirling back, and the surge sucks the rolling stones"
7592,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",away. Twice the Tuscans turn and drive the Rutulians towards the town;
7593,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","twice they are repelled, and look back behind them from cover of their"
7594,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","shields. But when now meeting in a third encounter, the lines are locked"
7595,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","together all their length, and man singles out his man; then indeed,"
7596,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","amid groans of the dying, deep in blood roll armour and bodies, and"
7597,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",horses half slain mixed up with slaughtered men. The battle swells
7598,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","fierce. Orsilochus hurled his spear at the horse of Remulus, whom"
7599,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","himself he shrank to meet, and left the steel in it under the ear; at"
7600,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","the stroke the charger rears madly, and, mastered by the wound, lifts"
7601,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",his chest and flings up his legs: the rider is thrown and rolls over on
7602,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","the ground. Catillus strikes down Iollas, and Herminius mighty in"
7603,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","courage, mighty in limbs and arms, bareheaded, tawny-haired,"
7604,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","bare-shouldered; undismayed by wounds, he leaves his vast body open"
7605,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",against arms. Through his broad shoulders the quivering spear runs
7606,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","piercing him through, and doubles him up with pain. Everywhere the dark"
7607,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","blood flows; they deal death with the sword in battle, and seek a noble"
7608,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",death by wounds.
7609,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",
7610,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","But amid the slaughter Camilla rages, a quivered Amazon, with one side"
7611,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","stripped for battle, and now sends tough javelins showering from her"
7612,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","hand, now snatches the strong battle-axe in her unwearying grasp; the"
7613,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","golden bow, the armour of Diana, clashes on her shoulders; and even when"
7614,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","forced backward in retreat, she turns in flight and [654-691]aims darts"
7615,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","from her bow. But around her are her chosen comrades, maiden Larina,"
7616,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Tulla, Tarpeia brandishing an axe inlaid with bronze, girls of Italy,"
7617,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","whom Camilla the bright chose for her own escort, good at service in"
7618,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",peace and war: even as Thracian Amazons when the streams of Thermodon
7619,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","clash beneath them as they go to war in painted arms, whether around"
7620,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Hippolyte, or while martial Penthesilea returns in her chariot, and the"
7621,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",crescent-shielded columns of women dance with loud confused cry. Whom
7622,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","first, whom last, fierce maiden, does thy dart strike down? First"
7623,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Euneus, son of Clytius; for as he meets her the long fir shaft crashes"
7624,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","through his open breast. He falls spouting streams of blood, and bites"
7625,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","the gory ground, and dying writhes himself upon his wound. Then Liris"
7626,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","and Pagasus above him; who fall headlong and together, the one thrown as"
7627,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","he reins up his horse stabbed under him, the other while he runs forward"
7628,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",and stretches his unarmed hand to stay his fall. To these she joins
7629,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Amastrus, son of Hippotas, and follows from far with her spear Tereus"
7630,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",and Harpalycus and DemophoÃ¶n and Chromis: and as many darts as the
7631,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","maiden sends whirling from her hand, so many Phrygians fall. Ornytus the"
7632,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","hunter rides near in strange arms on his Iapygian horse, his broad"
7633,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","warrior's shoulders swathed in the hide stripped from a bullock, his"
7634,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",head covered by a wolf's wide-grinning mouth and white-tusked jaws; a
7635,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",rustic pike arms his hand; himself he moves amid the squadrons a full
7636,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","head over all. Catching him up (for that was easy amid the rout), she"
7637,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","runs him through, and thus cries above her enemy: 'Thou wert hunting"
7638,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","wild beasts in the forest, thoughtest thou, Tyrrhenian? the day is come"
7639,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",for a woman's arms to refute thy words. Yet no light fame shalt thou
7640,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","carry to thy fathers' ghosts, to have fallen under the weapon of"
7641,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Camilla.' Next Orsilochus and Butes, the two mightiest of mould among"
7642,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",the Teucrians; Butes she pierces in the [692-725]back with her
7643,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","spear-point between corslet and helmet, where the neck shews as he sits,"
7644,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","and the shield hangs from his left shoulder; Orsilochus she flies, and"
7645,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","darting in a wide circle, slips into the inner ring and pursues her"
7646,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","pursuer; then rising her full height, she drives the strong axe deep"
7647,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","through armour and bone, as he pleads and makes much entreaty; warm"
7648,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",brain from the wound splashes his face. One met her thus and hung
7649,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","startled by the sudden sight, the warrior son of Aunus haunter of the"
7650,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Apennine, not the meanest in Liguria while fate allowed him to deceive."
7651,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","And he, when he discerns that no fleetness of foot may now save him from"
7652,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","battle or turn the princess from pursuit, essays to wind a subtle device"
7653,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","of treachery, and thus begins: 'How hast thou glory, if a woman trust in"
7654,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",her horse's strength? Debar retreat; trust thyself to level ground at
7655,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","close quarters with me, and prepare to fight on foot. Soon wilt thou"
7656,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","know how windy boasting brings one to harm.' He spoke; but she, furious"
7657,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","and stung with fiery indignation, hands her horse to an attendant, and"
7658,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","takes her stand in equal arms on foot and undismayed, with naked sword"
7659,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","and shield unemblazoned. But he, thinking his craft had won the day,"
7660,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","himself flies off on the instant, and turning his rein, darts off in"
7661,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","flight, pricking his beast to speed with iron-armed heel. 'False"
7662,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Ligurian, in vain elated in thy pride! for naught hast thou attempted"
7663,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","thy slippery native arts, nor will thy craft bring thee home unhurt to"
7664,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","treacherous Aunus.' So speaks the maiden, and with running feet swift as"
7665,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","fire crosses his horse, and catching the bridle, meets him in front and"
7666,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","takes her vengeance in her enemy's blood: as lightly as the falcon, bird"
7667,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","of bale, swoops down from aloft on a pigeon high in a cloud, and pounces"
7668,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","on and holds her, and disembowels her with taloned feet, while blood and"
7669,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",torn feathers flutter down the sky.
7670,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",
7671,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",But the creator of men and gods sits high on Olympus' [726-759]summit
7672,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","watching this, not with eyes unseeing: he kindles Tyrrhenian Tarchon to"
7673,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","the fierce battle, and sharply goads him on to wrath. So Tarchon gallops"
7674,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","amid the slaughter where his squadrons retreat, and urges his troops in"
7675,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","changing tones, calling man on man by name, and rallies the fliers to"
7676,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","fight. 'What terror, what utter cowardice hath fallen on your spirits, O"
7677,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","never to be stung to shame, O slack alway? a woman drives you in"
7678,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",disorder and routs our ranks! Why wear we steel? for what are these idle
7679,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","weapons in our hands? Yet not slack in Venus' service and wars by night,"
7680,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","or, when the curving flute proclaims Bacchus' revels, to look forward to"
7681,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","the feast and the cups on the loaded board (this your passion, this your"

7683,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","fatted victim invite you to the deep groves.' So speaking, he spurs his"
7684,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","horse into the midmost, ready himself to die, and bears violently down"
7685,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","full on Venulus; and tearing him from horseback, grasps his enemy and"
7686,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",carries him away with him on the saddle-bow by main force. A cry rises
7687,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","up, and all the Latins turn their eyes. Tarchon flies like fire over the"
7688,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","plain, carrying the armed man, and breaks off the steel head from his"
7689,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","own spear and searches the uncovered places, trying where he may deal"
7690,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",the mortal blow; the other struggling against him keeps his hand off his
7691,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","throat, and strongly parries his attack. And, as when a golden eagle"
7692,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","snatches and soars with a serpent in his clutch, and his feet are fast"
7693,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","in it, and his talons cling; but the wounded snake writhes in coiling"
7694,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","spires, and its scales rise and roughen, and its mouth hisses as it"
7695,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",towers upward; the bird none the less attacks his struggling prize with
7696,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","crooked beak, while his vans beat the air: even so Tarchon carries"
7697,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Tiburtus out of the ranks, triumphant in his prize. Following their"
7698,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","captain's example and issue the men of Maeonia charge in. Then Arruns,"
7699,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","due to his [760-796]doom, circles in advance of fleet Camilla with"
7700,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","artful javelin, and tries how fortune may be easiest. Where the maiden"
7701,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","darts furious amid the ranks, there Arruns slips up and silently tracks"
7702,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",her footsteps; where she returns victorious and retires from amid the
7703,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","enemy, there he stealthily bends his rapid reins. Here he approaches,"
7704,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","and here again he approaches, and strays all round and about, and"
7705,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","untiringly shakes his certain spear. Haply Chloreus, sacred to Cybele"
7706,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","and once her priest, glittered afar, splendid in Phrygian armour; a skin"
7707,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",feathered with brazen scales and clasped with gold clothed the horse
7708,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",that foamed under his spur; himself he shone in foreign blue and
7709,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","scarlet, with fleet Gortynian shafts and a Lycian horn; a golden bow was"
7710,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","on his shoulder, and the soothsayer's helmet was of gold; red gold"
7711,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",knotted up his yellow scarf with its rustling lawny folds; his tunics
7712,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","and barbarian trousers were wrought in needlework. Him, whether that she"
7713,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","might nail armour of Troy on her temples, or herself move in captive"
7714,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","gold, the maiden pursued in blind chase alone of all the battle"
7715,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","conflict, and down the whole line, reckless and fired by a woman's"
7716,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",passion for spoils and plunder: when at last out of his ambush Arruns
7717,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","chooses his time and darts his javelin, praying thus aloud to heaven:"
7718,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","'Apollo, most high of gods, holy Soracte's warder, to whom we beyond all"
7719,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","do worship, for whom the blaze of the pinewood heap is fed, where we thy"
7720,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",worshippers in pious faith print our steps amid the deep embers of the
7721,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","fire, grant, O Lord omnipotent, that our arms wipe off this disgrace. I"
7722,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","seek not the dress the maiden wore, nor trophy or any spoil of victory;"
7723,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",other deeds shall bring me praise; let but this dread scourge fall
7724,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","stricken beneath my wound, I will return inglorious to my native towns.'"
7725,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Phoebus heard, and inly granted half his vow to prosper, half he shred"
7726,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",into the flying breezes. To surprise and strike down Camilla in sudden
7727,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","death, this he [797-831]yielded to his prayer; that his high home might"
7728,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","see his return he gave not, and a gust swept off his accents on the"
7729,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","gale. So, when the spear sped from his hand hurtled through the air, all"
7730,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",the Volscians marked it well and turned their eyes on the queen; and she
7731,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","alone knew not wind or sound of the weapon on its aery path, till the"
7732,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","spear passed home and sank where her breast met it, and, driven deep,"
7733,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",drank her maiden blood. Her companions run hastily up and catch their
7734,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","sinking mistress. Arruns takes to flight more alarmed than all, in"
7735,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","mingled fear and exultation, and no longer dares to trust his spear or"
7736,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","face the maiden's weapons. And as the wolf, some shepherd or great"
7737,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","bullock slain, plunges at once among the trackless mountain heights ere"
7738,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","hostile darts are in pursuit, and knows how reckless he hath been, and"
7739,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","drooping his tail lays it quivering under his belly, and seeks the"
7740,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","woods; even so does Arruns withdraw from sight in dismay, and, satisfied"
7741,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","to escape, mingles in the throng of arms. The dying woman pulls at the"
7742,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",weapon with her hand; but the iron head is fixed deep in the wound up
7743,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",between the rib-bones. She swoons away with loss of blood; chilling in
7744,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",death her eyes swoon away; the once lustrous colour leaves her face.
7745,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Then gasping, she thus accosts Acca, one of her birthmates, who alone"
7746,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","before all was true to Camilla, with whom her cares were divided; and"
7747,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","even so she speaks: 'Thus far, Acca my sister, have I availed; now the"
7748,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","bitter wound overmasters me, and all about me darkens in haze. Haste"
7749,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","away, and carry to Turnus my last message; to take my place in battle,"
7750,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",and repel the Trojans from the town. And now goodbye.' Even with the
7751,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",words she dropped the reins and slid to ground unconscious. Then the
7752,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","unnerving chill overspread her, her neck slackened, her head sank"
7753,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","overpowered by death, and her arms fell, and with a moan the life fled"
7754,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",indignant into the dark. Then indeed an [832-867]infinite cry rises and
7755,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",smites the golden stars; the battle grows bloodier now Camilla is down;
7756,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","at once in serried rants all the Teucrian forces pour in, with the"
7757,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",Tyrrhene captains and Evander's Arcadian squadrons.
7758,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",
7759,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","But Opis, Trivia's sentinel, long ere now sits high on the hill-tops,"
7760,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",gazing on the battle undismayed. And when afar amid the din of angry men
7761,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","she espied Camilla done woefully to death, she sighed and uttered forth"
7762,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","a deep cry: 'Ah too, too cruel, O maiden, the forfeit thou hast paid for"
7763,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",daring armed attack on the Teucrians! and nothing hath availed thee thy
7764,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","lonely following of Diana in the woodlands, nor wearing our quiver on"
7765,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",thy shoulder. Yet thy Queen hath not left thee unhonoured now thy latter
7766,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","end is come; nor will this thy death be unnamed among the nations, nor"
7767,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",shalt thou bear the fame of one unavenged; for whosoever hath sullied
7768,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",thy body with a wound shall pay death for due.' Under the mountain
7769,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","height was a great earthen mound, tomb of Dercennus, a Laurentine king"
7770,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","of old, shrouded in shadowy ilex. Hither the goddess most beautiful"
7771,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","first swoops down, and marks Arruns from the mounded height. As she saw"
7772,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","him glittering in arms and idly exultant: 'Why,' she cries, 'wanderest"
7773,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","thou away? hitherward direct thy steps; come hither to thy doom, to"
7774,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","receive thy fit reward for Camilla. Shalt thou die, and by Diana's"

7776,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","quiver, and stretched it level on the bow, and drew it far, till the"
7777,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","curving tips met one another, and now her hands touched in counterpoise,"
7778,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","the left the steel edge, the string in the right her breast. At once and"
7779,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","in a moment Arruns heard the whistle of the dart and the resounding air,"
7780,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",as the steel sank in his body. His comrades leave him forgotten on the
7781,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","unknown dust of the plain, moaning his last and gasping his life away;"
7782,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",Opis wings her flight to the skyey heaven.
7783,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",
7784,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",[868-901]At once the light squadron of Camilla retreat now they have
7785,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","lost their mistress; the Rutulians retreat in confusion, brave Atinas"
7786,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","retreats. Scattered captains and thinned companies make for safety, and"
7787,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",turn their horses backward to the town. Nor does any avail to make stand
7788,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","against the swarming death-dealing Teucrians, or bear their shock in"
7789,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","arms; but their unstrung bows droop on their shoulders, and the"
7790,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",four-footed galloping horse-hoof shakes the crumbling plain. The eddying
7791,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","dust rolls up thick and black towards the walls, and on the watch-towers"
7792,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",mothers beat their breasts and the cries of women rise up to heaven. On
7793,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",such as first in the rout broke in at the open gates the mingling
7794,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","hostile throng follows hard; nor do they escape death, alas! but in the"
7795,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","very gateway, within their native city and amid their sheltering homes,"
7796,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","they are pierced through and gasp out their life. Some shut the gates,"
7797,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",and dare not open to their pleading comrades nor receive them in the
7798,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",town; and a most pitiful slaughter begins between armed men who guard
7799,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",the entry and others who rush upon their arms. Barred out before their
7800,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","weeping parents' eyes and faces, some, swept on by the rout, roll"
7801,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","headlong into the trenches; some, blindly rushing with loosened rein,"
7802,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",batter at the gates and stiffly-bolted doorway. The very mothers from
7803,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","the walls in eager heat (true love of country points the way, when they"
7804,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","see Camilla) dart weapons with shaking hand, and eagerly make hard"
7805,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","stocks of wood and fire-hardened poles serve for steel, and burn to die"
7806,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",among the foremost for their city's sake.
7807,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",
7808,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","Meanwhile among the forests the terrible news pours in on Turnus, and"
7809,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",Acca brings him news of the mighty invasion; the Volscian lines are
7810,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","destroyed; Camilla is fallen; the enemy thicken and press on, and have"
7811,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",swept all before them down the tide of battle. Raging he leaves the
7812,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",hills he had beset--Jove's stern will ordains it [902-915]so--and quits
7813,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",the rough woodland. Scarcely had he marched out of sight and gained the
7814,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","plain when lord Aeneas enters the open defiles, surmounts the ridge, and"
7815,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",issues from the dim forest. So both advance swiftly to the town with all
7816,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","their columns, no long march apart, and at once Aeneas descried afar the"
7817,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","plains all smoking with dust, and saw the Laurentine columns, and Turnus"
7818,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","knew Aeneas terrible in arms, and heard the advancing feet and the"
7819,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA",neighing of the horses. And straightway would they join battle and essay
7820,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","the conflict, but that ruddy Phoebus even now dips his weary coursers in"
7821,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","the Iberian flood, and night draws on over the fading day. They encamp"
7822,"THE COUNCIL OF THE LATINS, AND THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CAMILLA","before the city, and draw their trenches round the walls."

7830,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
7831,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
7832,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,When Turnus sees the Latins broken and fainting in the thwart issue of
7833,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"war, his promise claimed for fulfilment, and men's eyes pointed on him,"
7834,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,his own spirit rises in unappeasable flame. As the lion in Phoenician
7835,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"fields, his breast heavily wounded by the huntsmen, at last starts into"
7836,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"arms, and shakes out the shaggy masses from his exultant neck, and"
7837,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"undismayed snaps the brigand's planted weapon, roaring with"
7838,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,blood-stained mouth; even so Turnus kindles and swells in passion. Then
7839,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"he thus addresses the king, and so furiously begins:"
7840,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
7841,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,'Turnus stops not the way; there is no excuse for the coward Aeneadae to
7842,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,take back their words or renounce their compact. I join battle; bring
7843,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"the holy things, my lord, and swear the treaty. Either this hand shall"
7844,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"hurl to hell the Dardanian who skulks from Asia, and the Latins sit and"
7845,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,see my single sword wipe out the nation's reproach; or let him rule his
7846,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"conquest, and Lavinia pass to his espousal.'"
7847,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
7848,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,To him Latinus calmly replied: 'O excellent young man! the more thy hot
7849,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"valour abounds, the more intently must I counsel, and weigh fearfully"
7850,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"what may befall. Thou hast thy father Daunus' realm, hast many towns"
7851,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"taken by [23-55]thine hand, nor is Latinus lacking in gold and"
7852,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,goodwill. There are other maidens unwedded in Latium and Laurentine
7853,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"fields, and of no mean birth. Let me unfold this hard saying in all"
7854,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,sincerity: and do thou drink it into thy soul. I might not ally my
7855,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,daughter to any of her old wooers; such was the universal oracle of gods
7856,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"and men. Overborne by love for thee, overborne by kinship of blood and"
7857,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"my weeping wife's complaint, I broke all fetters, I severed the maiden"
7858,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"from her promised husband, I took up unrighteous arms. Since then,"
7859,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Turnus, thou seest what calamities, what wars pursue me, what woes"
7860,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"thyself before all dost suffer. Twice vanquished in pitched battle, we"
7861,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,scarce guard in our city walls the hopes of Italy: the streams of Tiber
7862,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"yet run warm with our blood, and our bones whiten the boundless plain."
7863,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,Why fall I away again and again? what madness bends my purpose? if I am
7864,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"ready to take them into alliance after Turnus' destruction, why do I not"
7865,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"rather bar the strife while he lives? What will thy Rutulian kinsmen,"
7866,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"will all Italy say, if thy death--Fortune make void the word!--comes by"
7867,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"my betrayal, while thou suest for our daughter in marriage? Cast a"
7868,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"glance on war's changing fortune; pity thine aged father, who now far"
7869,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,away sits sad in his native Ardea.'
7870,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
7871,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"In nowise do the words bend Turnus' passion: he rages the more fiercely,"
7872,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,and sickens of the cure. So soon as he found speech he thus made
7873,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,utterance:
7874,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
7875,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"'The care thou hast for me, most gracious lord, for me lay down, I"
7876,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"implore thee, and let me purchase honour with death. Our hand too rains"
7877,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"weapons, our steel is strong; and our wounds too draw blood. The goddess"
7878,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"his mother will be far from him to cover his flight, woman-like, in a"
7879,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,cloud and an empty phantom's hiding.'
7880,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
7881,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"But the queen, dismayed by the new terms of battle, wept, and clung to"
7882,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"her fiery son as one ready to die: [56-89]'Turnus, by these tears, by"
7883,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Amata's regard, if that touches thee at all--thou art now the one hope,"
7884,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,the repose of mine unhappy age; in thine hand is Latinus' honour and
7885,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"empire, on thee is the weight of all our sinking house--one thing I"
7886,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,beseech thee; forbear to join battle with the Teucrians. What fate
7887,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"soever awaits thee in the strife thou seekest, it awaits me, Turnus,"
7888,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"too: with thee will I leave the hateful light, nor shall my captive eyes"
7889,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,see Aeneas my daughter's lord.' Lavinia tearfully heard her mother's
7890,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"words with cheeks all aflame, as deep blushes set her face on fire and"
7891,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"ran hotly over it. Even as Indian ivory, if one stain it with sanguine"
7892,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"dye, or where white lilies are red with many a rose amid: such colour"
7893,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"came on the maiden's face. Love throws him into tumult, and stays his"
7894,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"countenance on the girl: he burns fiercer for arms, and briefly answers"
7895,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,Amata:
7896,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
7897,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"'Do not, I pray thee, do not weep for me, neither pursue me thus"
7898,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,ominously as I go to the stern shock of war. Turnus is not free to dally
7899,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"with death. Thou, Idmon, bear my message to the Phrygian monarch in this"
7900,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,harsh wording: So soon as to-morrow's Dawn rises in the sky blushing on
7901,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"her crimson wheels, let him not loose Teucrian or Rutulian: let Teucrian"
7902,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"and Rutulian arms have rest, and our blood decide the war; on that field"
7903,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,let Lavinia be sought in marriage.'
7904,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
7905,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"These words uttered, withdrawing swiftly homeward, he orders out his"
7906,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"horses, and rejoicingly beholds them snorting before his face: those"
7907,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"that Orithyia's self gave to grace Pilumnus, such as would excel the"
7908,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,snows in whiteness and the gales in speed. The eager charioteers stand
7909,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"round and pat their chests with clapping hollowed hands, and comb their"
7910,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,tressed manes. Himself next he girds on his shoulders the corslet stiff
7911,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"with gold and pale mountain-bronze, and buckles on the sword and shield"
7912,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,and scarlet-plumed [90-124]helmet-spikes: that sword the divine Lord of
7913,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,Fire had himself forged for his father Daunus and dipped glowing in the
7914,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Stygian wave. Next, where it stood amid his dwelling leaning on a massy"
7915,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"pillar, he strongly seizes his stout spear, the spoil of Actor the"
7916,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Auruncan, and brandishes it quivering, and cries aloud: 'Now, O spear"
7917,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"that never hast failed at my call, now the time is come; thee princely"
7918,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Actor once, thee Turnus now wields in his grasp. Grant this strong hand"
7919,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"to strike down the effeminate Phrygian, to rend and shatter the corslet,"
7920,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,and defile in dust the locks curled with hot iron and wet with myrrh.'
7921,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Thus madly he runs on: sparkles leap out from all his blazing face, and"
7922,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,his keen eyes flash fire: even as the bull when before his first fight
7923,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"he bellows awfully, and drives against a tree's trunk to make trial of"
7924,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"his angry horns, and buffets the air with blows or scatters the sand in"
7925,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,prelude of battle.
7926,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
7927,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"And therewithal Aeneas, terrible in his mother's armour, kindles for"
7928,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"warfare and awakes into wrath, rejoicing that offer of treaty stays the"
7929,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"war. Comforting his comrades and sorrowing IÃ¼lus' fear, he instructs"
7930,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"them of destiny, and bids bear answer of assurance to King Latinus, and"
7931,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,name the laws of peace.
7932,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
7933,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,Scarcely did the morrow shed on the mountain-tops the beams of risen
7934,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"day, as the horses of the sun begin to rise from the deep flood and"
7935,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,breathe light from their lifted nostrils; Rutulian and Teucrian men
7936,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,measured out and made ready a field of battle under the great city's
7937,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"ramparts, and midway in it hearth-fires and grassy altars to the gods of"
7938,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"both peoples; while others bore spring water and fire, draped in"
7939,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,priestly dress and their brows bound with grass of the field. The
7940,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Ausonian army issue forth, and crowd through the gates in streaming"
7941,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,serried columns. On this side all the Trojan and Tyrrhenian host pour in
7942,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"diverse armament, girt with iron even as though the harsh battle-strife"
7943,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,[125-158]called them forth. Therewith amid their thousands the captains
7944,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"dart up and down, splendid in gold and purple, Mnestheus, seed of"
7945,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Assaracus, and brave Asilas, and Messapus, tamer of horses, brood of"
7946,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,Neptune: then each on signal given retired to his own ground; they plant
7947,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,their spears in the earth and lean their shields against them. Mothers
7948,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"in eager abandonment, and the unarmed crowd and feeble elders beset"
7949,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"towers and house-roofs, or stand at the lofty gates."
7950,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
7951,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"But Juno, on the summit that is now called the Alban--then the mountain"
7952,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,had neither name nor fame or honour--looked forth from the hill and
7953,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"surveyed the plain and double lines of Laurentine and Trojan, and"
7954,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Latinus' town. Straightway spoke she thus to Turnus' sister, goddess to"
7955,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"goddess, lady of pools and noisy rivers: such worship did Jupiter the"
7956,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,high king of air consecrate to her for her stolen virginity:
7957,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
7958,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"'Nymph, grace of rivers, best beloved of our soul, thou knowest how out"
7959,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,of all the Latin women that ever rose to high-hearted Jove's thankless
7960,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"bed, thee only have I preferred and gladly given part and place in"
7961,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"heaven. Learn thy woe, that thou blame not me for it, Juturna. Where"
7962,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,fortune seemed to allow and the Destinies granted Latinus' estate to
7963,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"prosper, I shielded Turnus and thy city. Now I see him joining battle"
7964,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"with unequal fates, and the day of doom and deadly force draws nigh."
7965,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Mine eyes cannot look on this battle and treaty: thou, if thou darest"
7966,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"aught of more present help for the brother of thy blood, go on; it"
7967,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,befits thee. Haply relief shall follow misery.'
7968,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
7969,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Scarcely thus: when Juturna's eyes overbrimmed with tears, and thrice"
7970,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,and again she smote her hand on her gracious breast. 'This is not time
7971,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"for tears,' cries Juno, daughter of Saturn: 'hasten and snatch thy"
7972,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"brother, if it may be, from his death; or do thou waken war, and make"
7973,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,[159-191]the treaty abortive. I encourage thee to dare.' With such
7974,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"urgence she left her, doubting and dismayed, and grievously wounded in"
7975,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,soul.
7976,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
7977,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,Meanwhile the kings go forth; Latinus in mighty pomp rides in his
7978,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"four-horse chariot; twelve gilded rays go glittering round his brows,"
7979,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"symbol of the Sun his ancestor; Turnus moves behind a white pair,"
7980,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"clenching in his hand two broad-headed spears. On this side lord Aeneas,"
7981,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"fount of the Roman race, ablaze in starlike shield and celestial arms,"
7982,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"and close by Ascanius, second hope of mighty Rome, issue from the camp;"
7983,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"and the priest, in spotless raiment, hath brought the young of a bristly"
7984,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"sow and an unshorn sheep of two years old, and set his beasts by the"
7985,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"blazing altars. They, turning their eyes towards the sunrising, scatter"
7986,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,salted corn from their hands and clip the beasts with steel over the
7987,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"temples, and pour cups on the altars. Then Aeneas the good, with sword"
7988,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"drawn, thus makes invocation:"
7989,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
7990,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"'Be the Sun now witness, and this Earth to my call, for whose sake I"
7991,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"have borne to suffer so sore travail, and the Lord omnipotent, and thou"
7992,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"his wife, at last, divine daughter of Saturn, at last I pray more"
7993,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"favourable; and thou, mighty Mavors, who wieldest all warfare in"
7994,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"lordship beneath thy sway; and on the Springs and Rivers I call, and the"
7995,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Dread of high heaven, and the divinities of the blue seas: if haply"
7996,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"victory fall to Turnus the Ausonian, the vanquished make covenant to"
7997,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,withdraw to Evander's city; IÃ¼lus shall quit the soil; nor ever
7998,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"hereafter shall the Aeneadae return in arms to renew warfare, or attack"
7999,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,this realm with the sword. But if Victory grant battle to us and ours
8000,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"(as I think the rather, and so the rather may the gods seal their will),"
8001,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"I will not bid Italy obey my Teucrians, nor do I claim the realm for"
8002,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"mine; let both nations, unconquered, join treaty for ever under equal"
8003,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,law. Gods [192-225]and worship shall be of my giving: my father Latinus
8004,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"shall bear the sword, and have a father's prescribed command. For me my"
8005,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Teucrians shall establish a city, and Lavinia give the town her name.'"
8006,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
8007,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,Thus Aeneas first: thereon Latinus thus follows:
8008,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
8009,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"'By these same I swear, O Aeneas, by Earth, Sea, Sky, and the twin brood"
8010,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"of Latona and Janus the double-facing, and the might of nether gods and"
8011,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"grim Pluto's shrine; this let our Father hear, who seals treaties with"
8012,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"his thunderbolt. I touch the altars, I take to witness the fires and the"
8013,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"gods between us; no time shall break this peace and truce in Italy,"
8014,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"howsoever fortune fall; nor shall any force turn my will aside, not if"
8015,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"it dissolve land into water in turmoil of deluge, or melt heaven in"
8016,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,hell: so surely as this sceptre' (for haply he bore a sceptre in his
8017,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"hand) 'shall never burgeon into thin leafage and shady shoot, since once"
8018,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"in the forest cut down right to the stem it lost its mother, and the"
8019,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,steel lopped away its tressed arms: a tree of old: now the craftsman's
8020,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,hand hath bound it in adornment of brass and given it to our Latin
8021,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,fathers' bearing.'
8022,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
8023,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,With such words they sealed mutual treaty midway in sight of the
8024,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"princes. Then they duly slay the consecrated beasts over the flames, and"
8025,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"tear out their live entrails, and pile the altars with laden chargers."
8026,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
8027,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"But long ere this the Rutulians deemed the battle unequal, and their"
8028,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"hearts are stirred in changeful motion; and now the more, as they"
8029,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,discern nigher that in ill-matched strength . . . . heightened by
8030,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Turnus, as advancing with noiseless pace he humbly worships at the altar"
8031,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"with downcast eye, by his wasted cheeks and the pallor on his youthful"
8032,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"frame. Soon as Juturna his sister saw this talk spread, and the people's"
8033,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"mind waver in uncertainty, into the mid ranks, in feigned form of"
8034,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Camertus--his family was high in long ancestry, and his father's name"
8035,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"[226-260]for valour renowned, and himself most valiant in arms--into"
8036,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"the mid ranks she glides, not ignorant of her task, and scatters diverse"
8037,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"rumours, saying thus: 'Shame, O Rutulians! shall we set one life in the"
8038,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,breach for so many such as these? are we unequal in numbers or bravery?
8039,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"See, Troy and Arcadia is all they bring, and those fate-bound bands that"
8040,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,Etruria hurls on Turnus. Scarce is there an enemy to meet every other
8041,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,man of ours. He indeed will ascend to the gods for whose altars he
8042,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"devotes himself, and move living in the lips of men: we, our country"
8043,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"lost, shall bow to the haughty rigour of our lords, if we now sit"
8044,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,slackly on the field.'
8045,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
8046,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"By such words the soldiers' counsel was kindled yet higher and higher,"
8047,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"and a murmur crept through their columns; the very Laurentines, the very"
8048,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,Latins are changed; and they who but now hoped for rest from battle and
8049,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"rescue of fortune now desire arms and pray the treaty were undone, and"
8050,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"pity Turnus' cruel lot. To this Juturna adds a yet stronger impulse, and"
8051,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,high in heaven shews a sign more potent than any to confuse Italian
8052,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,souls with delusive augury. For on the crimsoned sky Jove's tawny bird
8053,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"flew chasing, in a screaming crowd, fowl of the shore that winged their"
8054,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"column; then suddenly stooping to the water, pounces on a noble swan"
8055,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"with merciless crooked talons. The startled Italians watch, while all"
8056,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"the birds together clamorously wheel round from flight, wonderful to"
8057,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"see, and dim the sky with their pinions, and in thickening cloud urge"
8058,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"their foe through air, till, conquered by their attack and his heavy"
8059,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"prey, he yielded and dropped it from his talons into the river, and"
8060,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,winged his way deep into the clouds. Then indeed the Rutulians
8061,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"clamorously greet the omen, and their hands flash out. And Tolumnius the"
8062,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"augur cries before them all: 'This it was, this, that my vows often have"
8063,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"sought; I welcome and know a deity; [261-294]follow me, follow, snatch"
8064,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"up the sword, O hapless people whom the greedy alien frightens with his"
8065,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"arms like silly birds, and with strong hand ravages your shores. He too"
8066,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"will take to flight, and spread his sails afar over ocean. Do you with"
8067,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"one heart close up your squadrons, and defend in battle your lost king.'"
8068,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"He spoke, and darting forward, hurled a weapon full on the enemy; the"
8069,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"whistling cornel-shaft sings, and unerringly cleaves the air. At once"
8070,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"and with it a vast shout goes up, and all their rows are amazed, and"
8071,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,their hearts hotly stirred. The spear flies on; where haply stood
8072,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,opposite in ninefold brotherhood all the beautiful sons of one faithful
8073,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Tyrrhene wife, borne of her to Gylippus the Arcadian, one of them,"
8074,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,midway where the sewn belt rubs on the flank and the clasp bites the
8075,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"fastenings of the side, one of them, excellent in beauty and glittering"
8076,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"in arms, it pierces clean through the ribs and stretches on the yellow"
8077,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"sand. But of his banded brethren, their courage fired by grief, some"
8078,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"grasp and draw their swords, some snatch weapons to throw, and rush"
8079,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,blindly forward. The Laurentine columns rush forth against them; again
8080,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,from the other side Trojans and Agyllines and Arcadians in painted
8081,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,armour flood thickly in: so hath one passion seized all to make decision
8082,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,by the sword. They pull the altars to pieces; through all the air goes a
8083,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"thick storm of weapons, and faster falls the iron rain. Bowls and"
8084,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"hearth-fires are carried off; Latinus himself retreats, bearing the"
8085,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"outraged gods of the broken treaty. The others harness their chariots,"
8086,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"or vault upon their horses and come up with swords drawn. Messapus,"
8087,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"eager to shatter the treaty, rides menacingly down on Aulestes the"
8088,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Tyrrhenian, a king in a king's array. Retreating hastily, and tripped on"
8089,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"the altars that meet him behind, the hapless man goes down on his head"
8090,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"and shoulders. But Messapus flies up with wrathful spear, and strikes"
8091,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"him, as he pleads sore, a deep downward [295-330]blow from horseback"
8092,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"with his beam-like spear, saying thus: _That for him: the high gods take"
8093,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,this better victim._ The Italians crowd in and strip his warm limbs.
8094,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Corynaeus seizes a charred brand from the altar, and meeting Ebysus as"
8095,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"he advances to strike, darts the flame in his face; his heavy beard"
8096,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"flamed up, and gave out a scorched smell. Following up his enemy's"
8097,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"confusion, the other seizes him with his left hand by the hair, and"
8098,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"bears him to earth with a thrust of his planted knee, and there drives"
8099,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,the unyielding sword into his side. Podalirius pursues and overhangs
8100,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,with naked sword the shepherd Alsus as he rushes amid the foremost line
8101,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"of weapons; Alsus swings back his axe, and severs brow and chin full in"
8102,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"front, wetting his armour all over with spattered blood. Grim rest and"
8103,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,iron slumber seal his eyes; his lids close on everlasting night.
8104,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
8105,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"But good Aeneas, his head bared, kept stretching his unarmed hand and"
8106,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,calling loudly to his men: 'Whither run you? What is this strife that so
8107,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"spreads and swells? Ah, restrain your wrath! truce is already stricken,"
8108,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,and all its laws ordained; mine alone is the right of battle. Leave me
8109,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"alone, and my hand shall confirm the treaty; these rites already make"
8110,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Turnus mine.' Amid these accents, amid words like these, lo! a whistling"
8111,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"arrow winged its way to him, sped from what hand or driven by what god,"
8112,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"none knows, or what chance or deity brought such honour to the"
8113,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Rutulians; the renown of the high deed was buried, nor did any boast to"
8114,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"have dealt Aeneas' wound. Turnus, when he saw Aeneas retreating from the"
8115,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"ranks and his captains in dismay, burns hot with sudden hope. At once he"
8116,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"calls for his horses and armour, and with a bound leaps proudly into his"
8117,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"chariot and handles the reins. He darts on, dealing many a brave man's"
8118,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"body to death; many an one he rolls half-slain, or crushes whole files"
8119,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"under his chariot, or seizes and showers spears on the fugitives. As"
8120,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,[331-364]when by the streams of icy Hebrus Mavors kindles to bloodshed
8121,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"and clashes on his shield, and stirs war and speeds his furious"
8122,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,coursers; they outwing south winds and west on the open plain; utmost
8123,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,Thrace groans under their hoof-beats; and around in the god's train rush
8124,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"the faces of dark Terror, and Wraths and Ambushes; even so amid the"
8125,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"battle Turnus briskly lashes on his reeking horses, trampling on the"
8126,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"foes that lie piteously slain; the galloping hoof scatters bloody dew,"
8127,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,and spurns mingled gore and sand. And now hath he dealt Sthenelus to
8128,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"death, and Thamyrus and Pholus, him and him at close quarters, the other"
8129,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"from afar; from afar both the sons of Imbrasus, Glaucus and Lades, whom"
8130,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Imbrasus himself had nurtured in Lycia and equipped in equal arms,"
8131,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,whether to meet hand to hand or to outstrip the winds on horseback.
8132,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Elsewhere Eumedes advances amid the fray, ancient Dolon's brood,"
8133,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"illustrious in war, renewing his grandfather's name, his father's"
8134,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"courage and strength of hand, who of old dared to claim Pelides' chariot"
8135,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,as his price if he went to spy out the Grecian camp; to him the son of
8136,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Tydeus told out another price for his venture, and he dreams no more of"
8137,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Achilles' horses. Him Turnus descried far on the open plain, and first"
8138,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"following him with light javelin through long space of air, stops his"
8139,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"double-harnessed horses and leaps from the chariot, and descends on his"
8140,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"fallen half-lifeless foe, and, planting his foot on his neck, wrests the"
8141,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"blade out of his hand and dyes its glitter deep in his throat, adding"
8142,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"these words withal: 'Behold, thou liest, Trojan, meting out those"
8143,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,Hesperian fields thou didst seek in war. Such guerdon is theirs who dare
8144,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,to tempt my sword; thus do they found their city.' Then with a
8145,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"spear-cast he sends Asbutes to follow him, and Chloreus and Sybaris,"
8146,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Dares and Thersilochus, and Thymoetes fallen flung over his horse's"
8147,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,neck. And as when [365-398]the Edonian North wind's wrath roars on the
8148,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"deep Aegean, and the wave follows it shoreward; where the blast comes"
8149,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"down, the clouds race over the sky; so, wheresoever Turnus cleaves his"
8150,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"way, columns retreat and lines turn and run; his own speed bears him on,"
8151,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,and his flying plume tosses as his chariot meets the breeze. Phegeus
8152,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"brooked not his proud approach; he faced the chariot, and caught and"
8153,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"twisted away in his right hand the mouths of his horses, spurred into"
8154,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,speed and foaming on the bit. Dragged along and hanging by the yoke he
8155,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"is left uncovered; the broad lance-head reaches him, pins and pierces"
8156,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"the double-woven breastplate, and lightly wounds the surface of his"
8157,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"body. Yet turning, he advanced on the enemy behind his shield, and"
8158,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,sought succour in the naked point; when the wheel running forward on its
8159,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"swift axle struck him headlong and flung him to ground, and Turnus'"
8160,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,sword following it smote off his head between the helmet-rim and the
8161,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"upper border of the breastplate, and left the body on the sand."
8162,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
8163,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"And while Turnus thus victoriously deals death over the plains,"
8164,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Mnestheus meantime and faithful Achates, and Ascanius by their side, set"
8165,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"down Aeneas in the camp, dabbled with blood and leaning every other step"
8166,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"on his long spear. He storms, and tries hard to pull out the dart where"
8167,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"the reed had broken, and calls for the nearest way of remedy, to cut"
8168,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"open the wound with broad blade, and tear apart the weapon's"
8169,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"lurking-place, and so send him back to battle. And now Iapix son of"
8170,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Iasus came, beloved beyond others of Phoebus, to whom once of old,"
8171,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"smitten with sharp desire, Apollo gladly offered his own arts and gifts,"
8172,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"augury and the lyre and swift arrows: he, to lengthen out the destiny of"
8173,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"a parent given over to die, chose rather to know the potency of herbs"
8174,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"and the practice of healing, and deal in a silent art unrenowned. Aeneas"
8175,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"stood chafing bitterly, propped on his vast spear, mourning"
8176,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"[399-435]IÃ¼lus and a great crowd of men around, unstirred by their"
8177,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"tears. The aged man, with garment drawn back and girt about him in"
8178,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Paeonian fashion, makes many a hurried effort with healing hand and the"
8179,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"potent herbs of Phoebus, all in vain; in vain his hand solicits the"
8180,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"arrow-head, and his pincers' grasp pulls at the steel. Fortune leads him"
8181,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,forward in nowise; Apollo aids not with counsel; and more and more the
8182,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"fierce clash swells over the plains, and the havoc draws nigher on."
8183,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Already they see the sky a mass of dust, the cavalry approaching, and"
8184,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,shafts falling thickly amid the camp; the dismal cry uprises of warriors
8185,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"fighting and falling under the War-god's heavy hand. At this, stirred"
8186,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"deep by her son's cruel pain, Venus his mother plucked from Cretan Ida a"
8187,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"stalk of dittamy with downy leaves and bright-tressed flowers, the plant"
8188,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,not unknown to wild goats when winged arrows are fast in their body.
8189,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"This Venus bore down, her shape girt in a dim halo; this she steeps with"
8190,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"secret healing in the river-water poured out and sparkling abrim, and"
8191,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,sprinkles life-giving juice of ambrosia and scented balm. With that
8192,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"water aged Iapix washed the wound, unwitting; and suddenly, lo! all the"
8193,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"pain left his body, all the blood in the deep wound was stanched. And"
8194,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"now following his hand the arrow fell out with no force, and strength"
8195,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,returned afresh as of old. 'Hasten! arms for him quickly! why stand
8196,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"you?' cries Iapix aloud, and begins to kindle their courage against the"
8197,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"enemy; 'this comes not by human resource or schooling of art, nor does"
8198,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"my hand save thee, Aeneas: a higher god is at work, and sends thee back"
8199,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"to higher deeds.' He, eager for battle, had already clasped on the"
8200,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"greaves of gold right and left, and scorning delay, brandishes his"
8201,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,spear. When the shield is adjusted by his side and the corslet on his
8202,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"back, he clasps Ascanius in his armed embrace, and lightly kissing him"
8203,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"through the helmet, cries: 'Learn of me, O boy, valour [436-470]and"
8204,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"toil indeed, fortune of others. Now mine hand shall give thee defence in"
8205,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"war, and lead thee to great reward: do thou, when hereafter thine age"
8206,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"ripens to fulness, keep this in remembrance, and as thou recallest the"
8207,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"pattern of thy kindred, let thy spirit rise to thy father Aeneas, thine"
8208,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,uncle Hector.'
8209,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
8210,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"These words uttered, he issued towering from the gates, brandishing his"
8211,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"mighty spear: with him in serried column rush Antheus and Mnestheus, and"
8212,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,all the throng streams forth of the camp. The field drifts with blinding
8213,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"dust, and the startled earth trembles under the tramp of feet. From his"
8214,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"earthworks opposite Turnus saw and the Ausonians saw them come, and an"
8215,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,icy shudder ran deep through their frame; first and before all the
8216,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Latins Juturna heard and knew the sound, and in terror fled away. He"
8217,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"flies on, and hurries his dark column over the open plain. As when in"
8218,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"fierce weather a storm-cloud moves over mid sea to land, with presaging"
8219,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"heart, ah me, the hapless husbandmen shudder from afar; it will deal"
8220,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"havoc to their trees and destruction to their crops, and make a broad"
8221,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"path of ruin; the winds fly before it, and bear its roar to the beach;"
8222,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,so the Rhoetean captain drives his army full on the foe; one and all
8223,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"they close up in wedges, and mass their serried ranks. Thymbraeus smites"
8224,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"massive Osiris with the sword, Mnestheus slays Arcetius, Achates Epulo,"
8225,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Gyas Ufens: Tolumnius the augur himself goes down, he who had hurled the"
8226,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"first weapon against the foe. Their cry rises to heaven, and in turn the"
8227,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,routed Rutulians give backward in flight over the dusty fields. Himself
8228,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"he deigns not to cut down the fugitives, nor pursue such as meet him"
8229,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,fair on foot or approach in arms: Turnus alone he tracks and searches in
8230,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"the thick haze, alone calls him to conflict. Then panic-stricken the"
8231,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"warrior maiden flings Turnus' charioteer out over his reins, and leaving"
8232,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"him far where he slips from the [471-504]chariot-pole, herself succeeds"
8233,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"and turns the wavy reins, tones and limbs and armour all of Metiscus'"
8234,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,wearing. As when a black swallow flits through some rich lord's spacious
8235,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"house, and circles in flight the lofty halls, gathering her tiny food"
8236,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"for sustenance to her twittering nestlings, and now swoops down the"
8237,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"spacious colonnades, now round the wet ponds; in like wise dart"
8238,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Juturna's horses amid the enemy, and her fleet chariot passes flying"
8239,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,over all the field. And now here and now here she displays her
8240,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"triumphant brother, nor yet allows him to close, but flies far and away."
8241,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"None the less does Aeneas thread the circling maze to meet him, and"
8242,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"tracks his man, and with loud cry cries on him through the scattered"
8243,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,ranks. Often as he cast eyes on his enemy and essayed to outrun the
8244,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"speed of the flying-footed horses, so often Juturna wheeled her team"
8245,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"away. Alas, what can he do? Vainly he tosses on the ebb and flow, and in"
8246,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"his spirit diverse cares make conflicting call; when Messapus, who haply"
8247,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"bore in his left hand two tough spear-shafts topped with steel, runs"
8248,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,lightly up and aims and hurls one of them upon him with unerring stroke.
8249,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Aeneas stood still, and gathered himself behind his armour, sinking on"
8250,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"bended knee; yet the rushing spear bore off his helmet-spike, and dashed"
8251,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,the helmet-plume from the crest. Then indeed his wrath swells; and
8252,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"forced to it by their treachery, while chariot and horses disappear, he"
8253,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"calls Jove oft and again to witness, and the altars of the violated"
8254,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"treaty, and now at last plunges amid their lines. Sweeping terrible down"
8255,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"the tide of battle he wakens fierce indiscriminate carnage, and flings"
8256,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,loose all the reins of wrath.
8257,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
8258,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"What god may now unfold for me in verse so many woes, so many diverse"
8259,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"slaughters and death of captains whom now Turnus, now again the Trojan"
8260,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"hero, drives over all the field? Was it well, O God, that nations"
8261,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,destined to everlasting peace should clash in so vast a shock? Aeneas
8262,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,[505-540]meets Sucro the Rutulian; the combat stayed the first rush of
8263,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"the Teucrians, but delayed them not long; he catches him on the side,"
8264,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"and, when fate comes quickest, drives the harsh sword clean through the"
8265,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,ribs where they fence the breast. Turnus brings down Amycus from
8266,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"horseback with his brother Diores, and meets them on foot; him he"
8267,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"strikes with his long spear as he comes, him with his sword-point, and"
8268,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,hangs both severed heads on his chariot and carries them off dripping
8269,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"with blood. The one sends to death Talos and TanaÃ¯s and brave Cethegus,"
8270,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"three at one meeting, and gloomy Onites, of Echionian name, and Peridia"
8271,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,the mother that bore him; the other those brethren sent from Lycia and
8272,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Apollo's fields, and Menoetes the Arcadian, him who loathed warfare in"
8273,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,vain; who once had his art and humble home about the river-fisheries of
8274,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Lerna, and knew not the courts of the great, but his father was tenant"
8275,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,of the land he tilled. And as fires kindled dispersedly in a dry forest
8276,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"and rustling laurel-thickets, or foaming rivers where they leap swift"
8277,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"and loud from high hills, and speed to sea each in his own path of"
8278,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"havoc; as fiercely the two, Aeneas and Turnus, dash amid the battle;"
8279,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"now, now wrath surges within them, and unconquerable hearts are torn;"
8280,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,now in all their might they rush upon wounds. The one dashes Murranus
8281,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"down and stretches him on the soil with a vast whirling mass of rock, as"
8282,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"he cries the names of his fathers and forefathers of old, a whole line"
8283,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"drawn through Latin kings; under traces and yoke the wheels spurned him,"
8284,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,and the fast-beating hoofs of his rushing horses trample down their
8285,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"forgotten lord. The other meets Hyllus rushing on in gigantic pride, and"
8286,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,hurls his weapon at his gold-bound temples; the spear pierced through
8287,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,the helmet and stood fast in the brain. Neither did thy right hand save
8288,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"thee from Turnus, O Cretheus, bravest of the Greeks; nor did his gods"
8289,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,shield Cupencus when Aeneas came; he gave his [541-575]breast full to
8290,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"the steel, nor, alas! was the brazen shield's delay aught of avail. Thee"
8291,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"likewise, Aeolus, the Laurentine plains saw sink backward and cover a"
8292,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"wide space of earth; thou fallest, whom Argive battalions could not lay"
8293,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"low, nor Achilles the destroyer of Priam's realm. Here was thy goal of"
8294,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"death; thine high house was under Ida, at Lyrnesus thine high house, on"
8295,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Laurentine soil thy tomb. The whole battle-lines gather up, all Latium"
8296,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"and all Dardania, Mnestheus and valiant Serestus, with Messapus, tamer"
8297,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"of horses, and brave Asilas, the Tuscan battalion and Evander's Arcadian"
8298,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,squadrons; man by man they struggle with all their might; no rest nor
8299,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,pause in the vast strain of conflict.
8300,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
8301,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,At this Aeneas' mother most beautiful inspired him to advance on the
8302,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"walls, directing his columns on the town and dismaying the Latins with"
8303,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,sudden and swift disaster. As in search for Turnus he bent his glance
8304,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"this way and that round the separate ranks, he descries the city free"
8305,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"from all this warfare, unpunished and unstirred. Straightway he kindles"
8306,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,at the view of a greater battle; he summons Mnestheus and Sergestus and
8307,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"brave Serestus his captains, and mounts a hillock; there the rest of the"
8308,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Teucrian army gathers thickly, still grasping shield and spear. Standing"
8309,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"on the high mound amid them, he speaks: 'Be there no delay to my words;"
8310,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,Jupiter is with us; neither let any be slower to move that the design is
8311,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"sudden. This city to-day, the source of war, the royal seat of Latinus,"
8312,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"unless they yield them to receive our yoke and obey their conquerors,"
8313,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"will I raze to ground, and lay her smoking roofs level with the dust."
8314,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Must I wait forsooth till Turnus please to stoop to combat, and choose"
8315,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"again to face his conqueror? This, O citizens, is the fountain-head and"
8316,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"crown of the accursed war. Bring brands speedily, and reclaim the treaty"
8317,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,in fire.' He ended; all with spirit alike emulous form a wedge and
8318,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"advance in serried masses to the walls. Ladders are run [576-611]up,"
8319,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"and fire leaps sudden to sight. Some rush to the separate gates, and cut"
8320,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"down the guards of the entry, others hurl their steel and darken the sky"
8321,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"with weapons. Aeneas himself among the foremost, upstretching his hand"
8322,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"to the city walls, loudly reproaches Latinus, and takes the gods to"
8323,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"witness that he is again forced into battle, that twice now do the"
8324,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,Italians choose warfare and break a second treaty. Discord rises among
8325,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,the alarmed citizens: some bid unbar the town and fling wide their gates
8326,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"to the Dardanians, and pull the king himself towards the ramparts;"
8327,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,others bring arms and hasten to defend the walls: as when a shepherd
8328,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"tracks bees to their retreat in a recessed rock, and fills it with"
8329,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"stinging smoke, they within run uneasily up and down their waxen"
8330,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"fortress, and hum louder in rising wrath; the smell rolls in darkness"
8331,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"along their dwelling, and a blind murmur echoes within the rock as the"
8332,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,smoke issues to the empty air.
8333,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
8334,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"This fortune likewise befell the despairing Latins, this woe shook the"
8335,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,whole city to her base. The queen espies from her roof the enemy's
8336,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"approach, the walls scaled and firebrands flying on the houses; and"
8337,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"nowhere Rutulian ranks, none of Turnus' columns to meet them; alas! she"
8338,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"deems him destroyed in the shock of battle, and, distracted by sudden"
8339,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"anguish, shrieks that she is the source of guilt, the spring of ill, and"
8340,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,with many a mad utterance of frenzied grief rends her purple attire with
8341,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"dying hand, and ties from a lofty beam the ghastly noose of death. And"
8342,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"when the unhappy Latin women knew this calamity, first her daughter"
8343,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Lavinia tears her flower-like tresses and roseate cheeks, and all the"
8344,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,train around her madden in her suit; the wide palace echoes to their
8345,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"wailing, and from it the sorrowful rumour spreads abroad throughout the"
8346,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"town. All hearts sink; Latinus goes with torn raiment, in dismay at his"
8347,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"wife's doom and his city's downfall, defiling his hoary hair with"
8348,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,soilure of sprinkled dust.
8349,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
8350,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,[614-648]Meanwhile on the skirts of the field Turnus chases scattered
8351,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"stragglers, ever slacker to battle, ever less and less exultant in his"
8352,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,coursers' victorious speed. The confused cry came to him borne in blind
8353,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"terror down the breeze, and his startled ears caught the echoing tumult"
8354,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,and disastrous murmur of the town. 'Ah me! what agony shakes the city?
8355,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,or what is this cry that fleets so loud from the distant town?' So
8356,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"speaks he, and distractedly checks the reins. And to him his sister, as"
8357,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,changed into his charioteer Metiscus' likeness she swayed horses and
8358,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"chariot-reins, thus rejoined: 'This way, Turnus, let us pursue the brood"
8359,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"of Troy, where victory opens her nearest way; there are others whose"
8360,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"hands can protect their dwellings. Aeneas falls fiercer on the Italians,"
8361,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,and closes in conflict; let our hand too deal pitiless death on his
8362,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,Teucrians. Neither in tale of dead nor in glory of battle shalt thou
8363,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,retire outdone.' Thereat Turnus: . . .
8364,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
8365,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"'Ah my sister, long ere now I knew thee, when first thine arts shattered"
8366,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"the treaty, and thou didst mingle in the strife; and now thy godhead"
8367,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,conceals itself in vain. But who hath bidden thee descend from heaven to
8368,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,bear this sore travail? was it that thou mightest see thy hapless
8369,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"brother cruelly slain? for what do I, or what fortune yet gives promise"
8370,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"of safety? Before my very eyes, calling aloud on me, I saw Murranus,"
8371,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"than whom none other is left me more dear, sink huge to earth, borne"
8372,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"down by as huge a wound. Hapless Ufens is fallen, not to see our shame;"
8373,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,corpse and armour are in Teucrian hands. The destruction of their
8374,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"households, this was the one thing yet lacking; shall I suffer it? Shall"
8375,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"my hand not refute Drances' jeers? shall I turn my back, and this land"
8376,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"see Turnus a fugitive? Is Death all so bitter? Do you, O Shades, be"
8377,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"gracious to me, since the powers of heaven are estranged; to you shall I"
8378,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"go down, a pure spirit and [649-681]ignorant of your blame, never once"
8379,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,unworthy of my mighty fathers of old.'
8380,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
8381,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Scarce had he spoken thus; lo! Saces, borne flying on his foaming horse"
8382,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"through the thickest of the foe, an arrow-wound right in his face,"
8383,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"darts, beseeching Turnus by his name. 'Turnus, in thee is our last"
8384,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"safety; pity thy people. Aeneas thunders in arms, and threatens to"
8385,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,overthrow and hurl to destruction the high Italian fortress; and already
8386,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"firebrands are flying on our roofs. On thee, on thee the Latins turn"
8387,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"their gazing eyes; King Latinus himself mutters in doubt, whom he is to"
8388,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"call his sons, to whom he shall incline in union. Moreover the queen,"
8389,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"thy surest stay, hath fallen by her own hand and in dismay fled the"
8390,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,light. Alone in front of the gates Messapus and valiant Atinas sustain
8391,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,the battle-line. Round about them to right and left the armies stand
8392,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,locked and the iron field shivers with naked points; thou wheelest thy
8393,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,chariot on the sward alone.' At the distracting picture of his fortune
8394,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,Turnus froze in horror and stood in dumb gaze; together in his heart
8395,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"sweep the vast mingling tides of shame and maddened grief, and love"
8396,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,stung to frenzy and resolved valour. So soon as the darkness cleared and
8397,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"light returned to his soul, he fiercely turned his blazing eyeballs"
8398,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"towards the ramparts, and gazed back from his wheels on the great city."
8399,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,And lo! a spire of flame wreathing through the floors wavered up skyward
8400,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"and held a turret fast, a turret that he himself had reared of mortised"
8401,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"planks and set on rollers and laid with high gangways. 'Now, O my"
8402,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"sister, now fate prevails: cease to hinder; let us follow where deity"
8403,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"and stern fortune call. I am resolved to face Aeneas, resolved to bear"
8404,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"what bitterness there is in death; nor shalt thou longer see me shamed,"
8405,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"sister of mine. Let me be mad, I pray thee, with this madness before the"
8406,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"end.' He spoke, and leapt swiftly from his chariot to the field, and"
8407,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"darting through weapons [682-718]and through enemies, leaves his"
8408,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"sorrowing sister, and bursts in rapid course amid their columns. And as"
8409,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"when a rock rushes headlong from some mountain peak, torn away by the"
8410,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"blast, or if the rushing rain washes it away, or the stealing years"
8411,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,loosen its ancient hold; the reckless mountain mass goes sheer and
8412,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"impetuous, and leaps along the ground, hurling with it forests and herds"
8413,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,and men; thus through the scattering columns Turnus rushes to the city
8414,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"walls, where the earth is wettest with bloodshed and the air sings with"
8415,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"spears; and beckons with his hand, and thus begins aloud: 'Forbear now,"
8416,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"O Rutulians, and you, Latins, stay your weapons. Whatsoever fortune is"
8417,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"left is mine: I singly must expiate the treaty for you all, and make"
8418,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,decision with the sword.' All drew aside and left him room.
8419,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
8420,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"But lord Aeneas, hearing Turnus' name, abandons the walls, abandons the"
8421,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"fortress height, and in exultant joy flings aside all hindrance, breaks"
8422,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"off all work, and clashes his armour terribly, vast as Athos, or as"
8423,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Eryx, or as the lord of Apennine when he roars with his tossing ilex"
8424,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,woods and rears his snowy crest rejoicing into air. Now indeed Rutulians
8425,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"and Trojans and all Italy turned in emulous gaze, and they who held the"
8426,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"high city, and they whose ram was battering the foundations of the wall,"
8427,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,and unarmed their shoulders. Latinus himself stands in amaze at the
8428,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"mighty men, born in distant quarters of the world, met and making"
8429,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"decision with the sword. And they, in the empty level field that cleared"
8430,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"for them, darted swiftly forward, and hurling their spears from far,"
8431,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,close in battle shock with clangour of brazen shields. Earth utters a
8432,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"moan; the sword-strokes fall thick and fast, chance and valour joining"
8433,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"in one. And as in broad Sila or high on Taburnus, when two bulls rush to"
8434,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"deadly battle forehead to forehead, the herdsmen retire in terror, all"
8435,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"the herd stands dumb in dismay, and the heifers murmur in doubt which"
8436,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"shall be [719-752]lord in the woodland, which all the cattle must"
8437,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"follow; they violently deal many a mutual wound, and gore with their"
8438,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"stubborn horns, bathing their necks and shoulders in abundant blood; all"
8439,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,the woodland moans back their bellowing: even thus Aeneas of Troy and
8440,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,the Daunian hero rush together shield to shield; the mighty crash fills
8441,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"the sky. Jupiter himself holds up the two scales in even balance, and"
8442,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"lays in them the different fates of both, trying which shall pay forfeit"
8443,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"of the strife, whose weight shall sink in death. Turnus darts out,"
8444,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"thinking it secure, and rises with his whole reach of body on his"
8445,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"uplifted sword; then strikes; Trojans and Latins cry out in excitement,"
8446,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"and both armies strain their gaze. But the treacherous sword shivers,"
8447,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,and in mid stroke deserts its eager lord. If flight aid him not now! He
8448,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"flies swifter than the wind, when once he descries a strange hilt in his"
8449,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"weaponless hand. Rumour is that in his headlong hurry, when mounting"
8450,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"behind his yoked horses to begin the battle, he left his father's sword"
8451,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,behind and caught up his charioteer Metiscus' weapon; and that served
8452,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"him long, while Teucrian stragglers turned their backs; when it met the"
8453,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"divine Vulcanian armour, the mortal blade like brittle ice snapped in"
8454,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,the stroke; the shards lie glittering upon the yellow sand. So in
8455,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"distracted flight Turnus darts afar over the plain, and now this way and"
8456,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,now that crosses in wavering circles; for on all hands the Teucrians
8457,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"locked him in crowded ring, and the dreary marsh on this side, on this"
8458,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,the steep city ramparts hem him in.
8459,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
8460,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Therewith Aeneas pursues, though ever and anon his knees, disabled by"
8461,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"the arrow, hinder and stay his speed; and foot hard on foot presses"
8462,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,hotly on his hurrying enemy: as when a hunter courses with a fleet
8463,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,barking hound some stag caught in a river-loop or girt by the
8464,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"crimson-feathered toils, and he, in terror of the snares and the high"
8465,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"river-bank, [753-786]darts back and forward in a thousand ways; but the"
8466,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"keen Umbrian clings agape, and just catches at him, and as though he"
8467,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,caught him snaps his jaws while the baffled teeth close on vacancy. Then
8468,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"indeed a cry goes up, and banks and pools answer round about, and all"
8469,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"the sky echoes the din. He, even as he flies, chides all his Rutulians,"
8470,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"calling each by name, and shrieks for the sword he knew. But Aeneas"
8471,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"denounces death and instant doom if one of them draw nigh, and doubles"
8472,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"their terror with threats of their city's destruction, and though"
8473,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"wounded presses on. Five circles they cover at full speed, and unwind as"
8474,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"many this way and that; for not light nor slight is the prize they seek,"
8475,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,but Turnus' very lifeblood is at issue. Here there haply had stood a
8476,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"bitter-leaved wild olive, sacred to Faunus, a tree worshipped by"
8477,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"mariners of old; on it, when rescued from the waves, they were wont to"
8478,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,fix their gifts to the god of Laurentum and hang their votive raiment;
8479,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"but the Teucrians, unregarding, had cleared away the sacred stem, that"
8480,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,they might meet on unimpeded lists. Here stood Aeneas' spear; hither
8481,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,borne by its own speed it was held fast stuck in the tough root. The
8482,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Dardanian stooped over it, and would wrench away the steel, to follow"
8483,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,with the weapon him whom he could not catch in running. Then indeed
8484,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Turnus cries in frantic terror: 'Faunus, have pity, I beseech thee! and"
8485,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"thou, most gracious Earth, keep thy hold on the steel, as I ever have"
8486,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"kept your worship, and the Aeneadae again have polluted it in war.' He"
8487,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"spoke, and called the god to aid in vows that fell not fruitless. For"
8488,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"all Aeneas' strength, his long struggling and delay over the tough stem"
8489,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,availed not to unclose the hard grip of the wood. While he strains and
8490,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"pulls hard, the Daunian goddess, changing once more into the charioteer"
8491,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Metiscus' likeness, runs forward and passes her brother his sword. But"
8492,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Venus, indignant that the [787-818]Nymph might be so bold, drew nigh"
8493,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,and wrenched away the spear where it stuck deep in the root. Erect in
8494,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"fresh courage and arms, he with his faithful sword, he towering fierce"
8495,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"over his spear, they face one another panting in the battle shock."
8496,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
8497,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,Meanwhile the King of Heaven's omnipotence accosts Juno as she gazes on
8498,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"the battle from a sunlit cloud. 'What yet shall be the end, O wife? what"
8499,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"remains at the last? Heaven claims Aeneas as his country's god, thou"
8500,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"thyself knowest and avowest to know, and fate lifts him to the stars."
8501,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,With what device or in what hope hangest thou chill in cloudland? Was it
8502,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,well that a deity should be sullied by a mortal's wound? or that the
8503,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,lost sword--for what without thee could Juturna avail?--should be
8504,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"restored to Turnus and swell the force of the vanquished? Forbear now, I"
8505,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"pray, and bend to our entreaties; let not the pain thus devour thee in"
8506,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"silence, and distress so often flood back on me from thy sweet lips. The"
8507,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"end is come. Thou hast had power to hunt the Trojans over land or wave,"
8508,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"to kindle accursed war, to put the house in mourning, and plunge the"
8509,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,bridal in grief: further attempt I forbid thee.' Thus Jupiter began:
8510,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"thus the goddess, daughter of Saturn, returned with looks cast down:"
8511,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
8512,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"'Even because this thy will, great Jupiter, is known to me for thine,"
8513,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"have I left, though loth, Turnus alone on earth; nor else wouldst thou"
8514,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"see me now, alone on this skyey seat, enduring good and bad; but girt in"
8515,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"flame I were standing by their very lines, and dragging the Teucrians"
8516,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"into the deadly battle. I counselled Juturna, I confess it, to succour"
8517,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"her hapless brother, and for his life's sake favoured a greater daring;"
8518,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"yet not the arrow-shot, not the bending of the bow, I swear by the"
8519,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"merciless well-head of the Stygian spring, the single ordained dread of"
8520,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"the gods in heaven. And now I retire, and leave the battle in loathing."
8521,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"[819-854]This thing I beseech thee, that is bound by no fatal law, for"
8522,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,Latium and for the majesty of thy kindred. When now they shall plight
8523,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"peace with prosperous marriages (be it so!), when now they shall join in"
8524,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"laws and treaties, bid thou not the native Latins change their name of"
8525,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"old, nor become Trojans and take the Teucrian name, or change their"
8526,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"language, or alter their attire: let Latium be, let Alban kings endure"
8527,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"through ages, let Italian valour be potent in the race of Rome. Troy is"
8528,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,fallen; let her and her name lie where they fell.'
8529,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
8530,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,To her smilingly the designer of men and things:
8531,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
8532,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"'Jove's own sister thou art, and second seed of Saturn, such surge of"
8533,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"wrath tosses within thy breast! But come, allay this madness so vainly"
8534,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"stirred. I give thee thy will, and yield thee ungrudged victory. Ausonia"
8535,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"shall keep her native speech and usage, and as her name is, it shall be."
8536,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,The Trojans shall sink mingling into their blood; I will add their
8537,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"sacred law and ritual, and make all Latins and of a single speech. Hence"
8538,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"shall spring a race of tempered Ausonian blood, whom thou shalt see"
8539,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,outdo men and gods in duty; nor shall any nation so observe thy
8540,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"worship.' To this Juno assented, and in gladness withdrew her purpose;"
8541,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"meanwhile she quits her cloud, and retires out of the sky."
8542,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
8543,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"This done, the Father revolves inly another counsel, and prepares to"
8544,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"separate Juturna from her brother's arms. Twin monsters there are,"
8545,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"called the Dirae by their name, whom with infernal Megaera the dead of"
8546,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"night bore at one single birth, and wreathed them in like serpent coils,"
8547,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,and clothed them in windy wings. They appear at Jove's throne and in the
8548,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"courts of the grim king, and quicken the terrors of wretched men"
8549,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"whensoever the lord of heaven deals sicknesses and dreadful death, or"
8550,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,sends terror of war upon guilty cities. One of these Jupiter sent
8551,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"swiftly down from heaven's height, and bade her meet Juturna for a"
8552,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"[855-888]sign. She wings her way, and darts in a whirlwind to earth."
8553,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Even as an arrow through a cloud, darting from the string when Parthian"
8554,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"hath poisoned it with bitter gall, Parthian or Cydonian, and sped the"
8555,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"immedicable shaft, leaps through the swift shadow whistling and unknown;"
8556,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,so sprung and swept to earth the daughter of Night. When she espies the
8557,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Ilian ranks and Turnus' columns, suddenly shrinking to the shape of a"
8558,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"small bird that often sits late by night on tombs or ruinous roofs, and"
8559,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"vexes the darkness with her cry, in such change of likeness the monster"
8560,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"shrilly passes and repasses before Turnus' face, and her wings beat"
8561,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"restlessly on his shield. A strange numbing terror unnerves his limbs,"
8562,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"his hair thrills up, and the accents falter on his tongue. But when his"
8563,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"hapless sister knew afar the whistling wings of the Fury, Juturna"
8564,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"unbinds and tears her tresses, with rent face and smitten bosom. 'How, O"
8565,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Turnus, can thine own sister help thee now? or what more is there if I"
8566,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,break not under this? What art of mine can lengthen out thy day? can I
8567,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"contend with this ominous thing? Now, now I quit the field. Dismay not"
8568,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"my terrors, disastrous birds; I know these beating wings, and the sound"
8569,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"of death, nor do I miss high-hearted Jove's haughty ordinance. Is this"
8570,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,his repayment for my maidenhood? what good is his gift of life for ever?
8571,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,why have I forfeited a mortal's lot? Now assuredly could I make all this
8572,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"pain cease, and go with my unhappy brother side by side into the dark."
8573,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Alas mine immortality! will aught of mine be sweet to me without thee,"
8574,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"my brother? Ah, how may Earth yawn deep enough for me, and plunge my"
8575,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,godhead in the under world!'
8576,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
8577,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"So spoke she, and wrapping her head in her gray vesture, the goddess"
8578,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,moaning sore sank in the river depth.
8579,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
8580,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"But Aeneas presses on, brandishing his vast tree-like spear, and"
8581,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"fiercely speaks thus: 'What more delay is there [889-924]now? or why,"
8582,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Turnus, dost thou yet shrink away? Not in speed of foot, in grim arms,"
8583,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"hand to hand, must be the conflict. Transform thyself as thou wilt, and"
8584,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,collect what strength of courage or skill is thine; pray that thou
8585,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"mayest wing thy flight to the stars on high, or that sheltering earth"
8586,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"may shut thee in.' The other, shaking his head: 'Thy fierce words dismay"
8587,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"me not, insolent! the gods dismay me, and Jupiter's enmity.' And no more"
8588,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"said, his eyes light on a vast stone, a stone ancient and vast that"
8589,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"haply lay upon the plain, set for a landmark to divide contested fields:"
8590,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"scarcely might twelve chosen men lift it on their shoulders, of such"
8591,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,frame as now earth brings to birth: then the hero caught it up with
8592,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"trembling hand and whirled it at the foe, rising higher and quickening"
8593,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,his speed. But he knows not his own self running nor going nor lifting
8594,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"his hands or moving the mighty stone; his knees totter, his blood"
8595,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"freezes cold; the very stone he hurls, spinning through the empty void,"
8596,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,neither wholly reached its distance nor carried its blow home. And as in
8597,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"sleep, when nightly rest weighs down our languorous eyes, we seem vainly"
8598,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"to will to run eagerly on, and sink faint amidst our struggles; the"
8599,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"tongue is powerless, the familiar strength fails the body, nor will"
8600,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,words or utterance follow: so the disastrous goddess brings to naught
8601,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,all Turnus' valour as he presses on. His heart wavers in shifting
8602,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"emotion; he gazes on his Rutulians and on the city, and falters in"
8603,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"terror, and shudders at the imminent spear; neither sees he whither he"
8604,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"may escape nor how rush violently on the enemy, and nowhere his chariot"
8605,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,or his sister at the reins. As he wavers Aeneas poises the deadly
8606,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"weapon, and, marking his chance, hurls it in from afar with all his"
8607,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,strength of body. Never with such a roar are stones hurled from some
8608,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"engine on ramparts, nor does the thunder burst in so loud a peal."
8609,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Carrying grim death with it, the spear flies in fashion of some dark"
8610,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"whirlwind, and [925-952]opens the rim of the corslet and the utmost"
8611,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,circles of the sevenfold shield. Right through the thigh it passes
8612,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,hurtling on; under the blow Turnus falls huge to earth with his leg
8613,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"doubled under him. The Rutulians start up with a groan, and all the hill"
8614,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"echoes round about, and the width of high woodland returns their cry."
8615,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,Lifting up beseechingly his humbled eyes and suppliant hand: 'I have
8616,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"deserved it,' he says, 'nor do I ask for mercy; use thy fortune. If an"
8617,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"unhappy parent's distress may at all touch thee, this I pray; even such"
8618,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"a father was Anchises to thee; pity Daunus' old age, and restore to my"
8619,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"kindred which thou wilt, me or my body bereft of day. Thou art"
8620,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"conqueror, and Ausonia hath seen me stretch conquered hands. Lavinia is"
8621,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,thine in marriage; press not thy hatred farther.'
8622,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,
8623,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"Aeneas stood wrathful in arms, with rolling eyes, and lowered his hand;"
8624,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,and now and now yet more the speech began to bend him to waver: when
8625,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,high on his shoulder appeared the sword-belt with the shining bosses
8626,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"that he knew, the luckless belt of the boy Pallas, whom Turnus had"
8627,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"struck down with mastering wound, and wore on his shoulders the fatal"
8628,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"ornament. The other, as his eyes drank in the plundered record of his"
8629,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"fierce grief, kindles to fury, and cries terrible in anger: 'Mayest"
8630,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"thou, thou clad in the spoils of my dearest, escape mine hands? Pallas"
8631,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"it is, Pallas who now strikes the sacrifice, and exacts vengeance in thy"
8632,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"guilty blood.' So saying, he fiercely plunges the steel full in his"
8633,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,"breast. But his limbs grow slack and chill, and the life with a moan"
8634,THE SLAYING OF TURNUS,flies indignantly into the dark.

8650,BOOK FIRST,
8651,BOOK FIRST,l. 396--_Aut capere aut captas iam despectare videntur._ Henry seems
8652,BOOK FIRST,unquestionably right in explaining _captas despectare_ of the swans
8653,BOOK FIRST,"rising and hovering over the place where they had settled, this action"
8654,BOOK FIRST,being more fully expressed in the next two lines. The parallelism
8655,BOOK FIRST,"between ll. 396 and 400 exists, but it is inverted, _capere_"

8704,BOOK THIRD,l. 152--_qua se Plena per insertas fundebat Luna fenestras._ The usual
8705,BOOK THIRD,"explanation, which makes _insertas_ an epithet transferred by a sort of"
8706,BOOK THIRD,"hypallage from _Luna_ to _fenestras_, is extremely violent, and makes"
8707,BOOK THIRD,the word little more than a repetition of _se fundebat_. Servius

8791,BOOK NINTH,
8792,BOOK NINTH,The phrase _in tergum_ occurs twice elsewhere: ix. 764--meaning 'on the
8793,BOOK NINTH,back'; and xi. 653--meaning 'backward'; and in x. 718 the uncertainty
8794,BOOK NINTH,about the order of the lines makes it possible that _tergo decutit
8795,BOOK NINTH,"hastas_ was meant to refer to the boar, not to Mezentius. But the"
8796,BOOK NINTH,passages quoted by the editors there shew that the word might be used in
8797,BOOK NINTH,the sense of 'shield'; and this being so we are scarcely justified in
8798,BOOK NINTH,reading _aversi_ against all the good MSS.
