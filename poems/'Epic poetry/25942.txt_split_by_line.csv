76,PREFACE,
77,PREFACE,The following pages are designed to give a historical and critical
78,PREFACE,account of all that has been done in the way of translating _Beowulf_
79,PREFACE,from the earliest attempts of Sharon Turner in 1805 down to the present
80,PREFACE,"time. As a corollary to this, it presents a history of the text of the"
81,PREFACE,poem to the time of the publication of Grein's _Bibliothek der
82,PREFACE,angelsächsischen Poesie_ in 1859; for until the publication of this work
83,PREFACE,every editor of the poem was also its translator.
84,PREFACE,
85,PREFACE,It is hoped that the essay may prove useful as a contribution to
86,PREFACE,"bibliography, and serve as a convenient reference book for those in"
87,PREFACE,search of information regarding the value of texts and translations of
88,PREFACE,_Beowulf_.
89,PREFACE,
90,PREFACE,"The method of treating the various books is, in general, the same."
91,PREFACE,I have tried to give in each case an accurate bibliographical
92,PREFACE,"description of the volume, a notion of the value of the text used in"
93,PREFACE,"making it, &c. But the emphasis given to these topics has necessarily"
94,PREFACE,"varied from time to time. In discussing literal translations, for"
95,PREFACE,"example, much attention has been paid to the value of the text, while"
96,PREFACE,little or nothing is said of the value of the rendering as literature.
97,PREFACE,"On the other hand, in the case of a book which is literary in aim, the"
98,PREFACE,attention paid to the critical value of the book is comparatively small.
99,PREFACE,"At certain periods in the history of the poem, the chief value of a"
100,PREFACE,translation is its utility as a part of the critical apparatus for the
101,PREFACE,"interpretation of the poem; at other periods, a translation lays claim"
102,PREFACE,to our attention chiefly as imparting the literary features of the
103,PREFACE,original.
104,PREFACE,
105,PREFACE,"In speaking of the translations which we may call literary, I have"
106,PREFACE,"naturally paid most attention to the English versions, and this for"
107,PREFACE,"several reasons. In the first place, _Beowulf_ is an _English_ poem;"
108,PREFACE,"secondly, the number, variety, and importance of the English"
109,PREFACE,"translations warrant this emphasis; thirdly, the present writer is"
110,PREFACE,unable to discuss in detail the literary and metrical value of
111,PREFACE,"translations in foreign tongues. The account given of German, Dutch,"
112,PREFACE,"Danish, Swedish, French, and Italian versions is, therefore, of a more"
113,PREFACE,"strictly bibliographical nature; but, whenever possible, some notion has"
114,PREFACE,been given of the general critical opinion with regard to them.
115,PREFACE,
116,PREFACE,An asterisk is placed before the titles of books which the present
117,PREFACE,writer has not seen.
118,PREFACE,
119,PREFACE,"My thanks are due to the officials of the Library of Yale University,"
120,PREFACE,who secured for me many of the volumes here described; to Professor
121,PREFACE,"Ewald Flügel of Leland Stanford Junior University, who kindly lent me"
122,PREFACE,certain transcripts made for him at the British Museum; and to Mr.
123,PREFACE,"Edward Thorstenberg, Instructor in Swedish at Yale University, for help"
124,PREFACE,in reading the Danish and Swedish translations.

211,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,"Cotton Vitellius A. xv, where it occurs ninth in order, filling the"
212,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,"folios numbered 129a to 198b, inclusive."
213,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,
214,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,The first recorded notice of the MS. is to be found in Wanley's Catalog
215,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,"of Anglo-Saxon Manuscripts (Oxford, 1705), Volume III of Hickes's"
216,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,_Thesaurus_. The poem is thus described:--

230,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,"218, col. b, and 219, col. a."
231,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,
232,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,"No further notice was taken of the MS. until 1786, when Thorkelin[1]"
233,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,made two transcripts of it.
234,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,
235,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,In 1731 there occurred a disastrous fire which destroyed a number of the
236,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,"Cottonian MSS. The Beowulf MS. suffered at this time, its edges being"
237,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,"scorched and its pages shriveled. As a result, the edges have chipped"
238,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,"away, and some of the readings have been lost. It does not appear,"
239,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,"however, that these losses are of so great importance as the remarks of"
240,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,some prominent Old English scholars might lead us to suspect. Their
241,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,remarks give the impression that the injury which the MS. received in
242,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,the fire accounts for practically all of the illegible lines. That this
243,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,is not so may be seen by comparing the Wanley transcript with the
244,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,"Zupitza _Autotypes_. Writing in 1705, before the Cotton fire, Wanley"
245,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,found two illegible words at line 15--illegible because of fading and
246,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,rubbing. Of exactly the same nature appear to be the injuries at lines
247,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,"2220 ff., the celebrated passage which is nearly, if not quite,"
248,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,unintelligible. It would therefore be a safe assumption that such
249,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,injuries as these happened to the MS. before it became a part of the
250,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,"volume, Vitellius A. xv. The injuries due to scorching and burning are"
251,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,seldom of the first importance.
252,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,
253,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,This point is worth noting. Each succeeding scholar who transcribed the
254,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,"MS., eager to recommend his work, dwelt upon the rapid deterioration of"
255,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,"the parchment, and the reliability of his own readings as exact"
256,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,reproductions of what he himself had seen in the MS. before it reached
257,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,its present ruinous state. The result of this was that the emendations
258,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,of the editor were sometimes accepted by scholars and translators as the
259,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,"authoritative readings of the MS., when in reality they were nothing but"
260,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,"gratuitous additions. This is especially true of Thorpe[2], and the"
261,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,false readings which he introduced were never got rid of until the
262,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,Zupitza _Autotypes_ brought to light the sins of the various editors of
263,PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT,the poem. These statements regarding text and MS. will be developed in

307,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,
308,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,'The poem had remained untouched and unnoticed both here and
309,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"abroad until I observed its curious contents, and in 1805"
310,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,announced it to the public. I could then give it only a hasty
311,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"perusal, and from the MS. having a leaf interposed near its"
312,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"commencement, which belonged to a subsequent part, and from the"
313,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"peculiar obscurity which sometimes attends the Saxon poetry, I did"
314,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"not at that time sufficiently comprehend it, and had not leisure"
315,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,to apply a closer attention. But in the year 1818 I took it up
316,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"again, as I was preparing my third edition, and then made that"

321,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,The statement that the poem had remained untouched and unnoticed is not
322,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,strictly true. The public had not yet received any detailed information
323,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"regarding it; but Wanley[1] had mentioned the _Beowulf_ in his catalog,"
324,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"and Thorkelin had already made two transcripts of the poem, and was at"
325,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"work upon an edition. Turner, however, deserves full credit for first"
326,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,calling the attention of the English people to the importance of the
327,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,poem.
328,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,
329,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"In the third edition, of which the author speaks, many improvements were"
330,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,introduced into the digest of the story and some improvements into the
331,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,text of the translations. Many of these were gleaned from the _editio
332,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,princeps_ of Thorkelin[2]. The story is now told with a fair degree of
333,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"accuracy, although many serious errors remain: e.g. the author did not"
334,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"distinguish the correct interpretation of the swimming-match, an extract"
335,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"of which is given below. The translations are about as faulty as ever,"
336,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,as may be seen by comparing the two extracts. In the first edition only
337,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"the first part of the poem is treated; in the third, selections from the"
338,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,second part are added.
339,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,
340,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,No further changes were made in later editions of the History.

346,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"_Turner, and his Knowledge of Old English._"
347,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,
348,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,Sharon Turner (1768-1847) was from early youth devoted to the study of
349,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"Anglo-Saxon history, literature, and antiquities. His knowledge was"
350,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,largely derived from the examination of original documents in the
351,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,British Museum[3]. But the very wealth of the new material which he
352,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,found for the study of the literature kept him from making a thorough
353,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,study of it. It is to be remembered that at this time but little was
354,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,known of the peculiar nature of the Old English poetry. Turner gives
355,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"fair discussions of the works of Bede and Ælfric, but he knows"
356,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,practically nothing of the poetry. With the so-called _Paraphrase_ of
357,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"Cædmon he is, of course, familiar; but his knowledge of _Beowulf_ and"
358,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"_Judith_ is derived from the unique, and at that time (1805)"
359,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"unpublished, MS., Cotton Vitellius A. xv. Of the contents of the Exeter"
360,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,Book he knew nothing. The Vercelli Book had not yet been discovered. The
361,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,materials at hand for his study were a faulty edition of Cædmon and an
362,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"insufficient dictionary. The author, whose interest was of course"
363,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"primarily in history, was not familiar with the linguistic work of the"
364,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"day. It is, therefore, not surprising that his work was not of the best"
365,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,quality.

378,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,
379,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,'The most interesting remains of the Anglo-Saxon poetry which time
380,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"has suffered to reach us, are contained in the Anglo-Saxon poem in"
381,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"the Cotton Library, Vitellius A. 15. Wanley mentions it as a poem"
382,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"in which ""seem to be described the wars which one Beowulf, a Dane"
383,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"of the royal race of the Scyldingi, waged against the reguli of"
384,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"Sweden[4]."" But this account of the contents of the MS. is"
385,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,incorrect. It is a composition more curious and important. It is a
386,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,narration of the attempt of Beowulf to wreck the fæthe or deadly
387,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"feud on Hrothgar, for a homicide which he had committed. It may be"
388,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,called an Anglo-Saxon epic poem. It abounds with speeches which
389,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"Beowulf and Hrothgar and their partisans make to each other, with"
390,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"much occasional description and sentiment.' --Book vi, chap. iv,"

397,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,
398,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"'It begins with a proemium, which introduces its hero Beowulf to our"
399,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,notice.... The poet then states the embarkation of Beowulf and his
400,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,partisans....' Turner interprets the prolog as the description of the
401,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,embarkation of Beowulf on a piratical expedition. The accession of
402,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"Hrothgar to the throne of the Danes is then described, and the account"
403,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,of his 'homicide' is given. This remarkable mistake was caused by the
404,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,transposition of a sheet from a later part of the poem--the fight with
405,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,Grendel--to the first section of the poem. The sailing of Beowulf and
406,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,the arrival in the Danish land are then given. Turner continues: 'The
407,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"sixth section exhibits Hrothgar's conversation with his nobles, and"
408,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,Beowulf's introduction and address to him. The seventh section opens
409,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"with Hrothgar's answer to him, who endeavours to explain the"
410,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,circumstance of the provocation. In the eighth section a new speaker
411,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"appears, who is introduced, as almost all the personages in the poem are"
412,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"mentioned, with some account of his parentage and character.' Then"
413,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,follows the extract given below:
414,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,
415,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,Hunferth spoke
416,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,The son of Ecglafe;
417,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,Who had sat at the foot
418,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,Of the lord of the Scyldingi
419,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,Among the band of the battle mystery.
420,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,To go in the path of Beowulf
421,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,Was to him a great pride;
422,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,He was zealous
423,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,That to him it should be granted
424,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,That no other man
425,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,Was esteemed greater in the world
426,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,Under the heavens than himself.
427,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,'Art thou Beowulf
428,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,He that with such profit
429,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"Dwells in the expansive sea,"
430,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,Amid the contests of the ocean?
431,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,There yet[5] for riches go!
432,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,You try for deceitful glory
433,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,In deep waters[6].--
434,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"Nor can any man,"
435,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"Whether dear or odious,"
436,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,Restrain you from the sorrowful path--

438,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,To the miserable you[8] flourish:
439,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,You meet in the sea-street;

444,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,Seven nights have ye toiled.'
445,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,
446,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"After this extract, Turner continues:-- 'It would occupy too much room"
447,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,in the present volume to give a further account of this interesting
448,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"poem, which well deserves to be submitted to the public, with a"
449,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,translation and with ample notes. There are forty-two sections of it in
450,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,"the Cotton MS., and it ends there imperfectly. It is perhaps the oldest"
451,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,poem of an epic form in the vernacular language of Europe which now

510,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,utterly useless to-day. Sufficient general criticism of the work is
511,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,found in the preceding sections devoted to a discussion of the author
512,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,and his knowledge of Old English and of the _Beowulf_.
513,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,
514,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,In the third edition the author presents some criticisms of Thorkelin's

516,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,'corrections' are often misleading.
517,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,
518,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,Turner is to be censured for allowing an account of _Beowulf_ so full of
519,SHARON TURNER'S EXTRACTS,inaccuracy to be reprinted year after year with no attempt at its

603,THORKELIN'S EDITION,a scholar in early Germanic history. He had little beside this knowledge
604,THORKELIN'S EDITION,and his general acquaintance with Old Germanic languages to recommend
605,THORKELIN'S EDITION,him as an editor of the _Beowulf_. Grundtvig said that the transcript of
606,THORKELIN'S EDITION,the _Beowulf_ must have been the work of one wholly ignorant of Old
607,THORKELIN'S EDITION,English[3]. Thorkelin knew nothing of the peculiar style of Old English
608,THORKELIN'S EDITION,"poetry; he could recognize neither kenning, metaphor, nor compound. He"

613,THORKELIN'S EDITION,Thorkelin seems to have been little better fitted to understand the

616,THORKELIN'S EDITION,"that his body was given up to the sea, but thought that King Beowulf"
617,THORKELIN'S EDITION,"'expeditionem suscipit navalem.' He failed to identify Breca, and"
618,THORKELIN'S EDITION,thought that Hunferth was describing some piratical voyage of Beowulf's.
619,THORKELIN'S EDITION,"He makes Beowulf reply that 'piratas ubique persequitur et fudit,' and"
620,THORKELIN'S EDITION,'Finlandiæ arma infert[5].' He regarded Beowulf as the hero of the
621,THORKELIN'S EDITION,"Sigemund episode. He quite misapprehended the Finn episode, 'Fin, rex"

689,EXTRACT[7].,above passage with the MS. It may be added that the lines are among the
690,EXTRACT[7].,"simplest in the poem, and call for no emendation. In passages that"
691,EXTRACT[7].,"present any real difficulty, Thorkelin is, if possible, even more at"
692,EXTRACT[7].,fault.

707,EXTRACT[7].,"54, _for_ sode _read_ soðe."
708,EXTRACT[7].,
709,EXTRACT[7].,In the composition of his text Thorkelin made all the errors known to
710,EXTRACT[7].,"scribes and editors. He misread words and letters of the MS., although"
711,EXTRACT[7].,"he had two transcripts. He dropped letters, combinations of letters, and"
712,EXTRACT[7].,even whole words. He joined words that had no relation to each other;
713,EXTRACT[7].,he broke words into two or even three parts; he ignored compounds. He
714,EXTRACT[7].,produced many forms the like of which cannot be found in Old English.
715,EXTRACT[7].,One further example of his great carelessness may be given. The first
716,EXTRACT[7].,"line of the poem, which is written in large capitals in the MS.:--"
717,EXTRACT[7].,
718,EXTRACT[7].,Hwæt we Gardena....
719,EXTRACT[7].,
720,EXTRACT[7].,Thorkelin perversely transcribed:--
721,EXTRACT[7].,
722,EXTRACT[7].,Hwæt wegar Dena....
723,EXTRACT[7].,
724,EXTRACT[7].,and for this combination of syllables he chose the translation:--
725,EXTRACT[7].,
726,EXTRACT[7].,Quomodo Danorum.
727,EXTRACT[7].,
728,EXTRACT[7].,"There is, of course, no such word as 'wegar' in Old English."
729,EXTRACT[7].,
730,EXTRACT[7].,Of the necessity of punctuation Thorkelin seems to have been serenely
731,EXTRACT[7].,unconscious; he did not even follow the guides afforded by the MS. Had
732,EXTRACT[7].,"he done so, he would have saved himself many humiliating errors. For"
733,EXTRACT[7].,"example, in the text given above, to have noticed the periods mentioned"
734,EXTRACT[7].,in the collation would have been to avoid two glaring instances of
735,EXTRACT[7].,'running-in.'
736,EXTRACT[7].,
737,EXTRACT[7].,
738,EXTRACT[7].,_Criticism of the Translation._
739,EXTRACT[7].,
740,EXTRACT[7].,"But, in spite of the wretched text, it remained for the translation to"
741,EXTRACT[7].,discover the depths of Thorkelin's ignorance. It will be seen by reading
742,EXTRACT[7].,the extract given from the translation that he did not even perceive
743,EXTRACT[7].,"that two men were swimming in the sea. It is to be remembered, too, that"
744,EXTRACT[7].,his error of the 'piratical expedition' is carried on for sixty
745,EXTRACT[7].,lines--certainly a triumph of ingenuity. It is useless to attempt a
746,EXTRACT[7].,classification of the errors in this version. In the words of Kemble:--
747,EXTRACT[7].,
748,EXTRACT[7].,'Nothing but malevolence could cavil at the trivial errors which
749,EXTRACT[7].,"the very best scholars are daily found to commit, but the case is"
750,EXTRACT[7].,widely different when those errors are so numerous as totally to
751,EXTRACT[7].,destroy the value of a work. I am therefore most reluctantly
752,EXTRACT[7].,compelled to state that not five lines of Thorkelin's edition can
753,EXTRACT[7].,"be found in succession in which some gross fault, either in the"
754,EXTRACT[7].,"transcription or translation, does not betray the editor's utter"

812,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,
813,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,Nicolas Frederic Severin Grundtvig (1783-1872) was especially noted as a
814,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,student of Old Germanic literature. He began his career in 1806 by his
815,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,studies on the _Edda_. This was followed by a book on Northern Mythology
816,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"(1810), and by various creative works in verse and prose, the subjects"
817,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,of which were usually drawn from old Danish history. An account of his
818,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,labors on the _Beowulf_ will be found in the following section. His
819,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"interest in Old English literature continued through his long life, and"
820,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,he was well and favorably known among the scholars of his day.

823,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,_Circumstances of Publication._
824,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,
825,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"In _Beowulfs Beorh_ (Copenhagen, 1861), Grundtvig tells the story of his"
826,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,early translation of the poem. He had always had a passionate interest
827,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"in Danish antiquities, and was much excited upon the appearance of"
828,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"Thorkelin's text[2]. At that time, however, he knew no Old English, and"
829,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"his friend Rask, the famous scholar in Germanic philology, being absent"
830,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"from Denmark, he resolved to do what he could with the poem himself. He"
831,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,began by committing the entire poem to memory. In this way he detected
832,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,many of the outlines which had been obscured by Thorkelin. The results
833,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,of this study he published in the _Copenhagen Sketch-Book_ (_Kjøbenhavns
834,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"Skilderie_), 1815. When Thorkelin saw the studies he was furious, and"
835,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,pronounced the discoveries mere fabrications.
836,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,
837,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"But Rask, upon his return, thought differently, and proposed to"
838,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"Grundtvig that they edit the poem together. They began the work, but"
839,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,when they reached line 925 the edition was interrupted by Rask's journey
840,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,into Russia and Asia. With the help of Rask's _Anglo-Saxon Grammar_
841,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"(Stockholm, 1817), Grundtvig proceeded with his translation. By the"
842,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"munificence of Bülow, who had also given assistance to Thorkelin,"
843,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,Grundtvig was relieved of the expense of publication.

846,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,_Progress of the Interpretation of the Poem._
847,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,
848,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,Grundtvig was the first to understand the story of _Beowulf_. With no
849,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,other materials than Thorkelin's edition of the text and his own
850,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"knowledge of Germanic mythology, he discovered the sea-burial of King"
851,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"Scyld, the swimming-match, and the Finn episode. He identified Breca,"
852,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"Hnæf, Hengest, King Hrethel, and other characters whose names Thorkelin"
853,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,had filched from them.

856,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,_Text Used._
857,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,
858,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,Rask borrowed the original transcripts which Thorkelin had brought from
859,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"the British Museum, and copied and corrected them. This was the basis of"
860,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,Grundtvig's translation.

863,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,_Differences between the First and Second Editions._
864,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,
865,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,The principal difference is in the introduction; but of the nature and
866,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,extent of changes in the second edition I can give no notion. All my
867,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,information respecting the first volume is derived from transcripts of
868,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,certain parts of it sent me from the British Museum. These copies do not
869,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,reveal any differences between the two translations.

872,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"_Aim of the Volume, and Nature of the Translation._"
873,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,
874,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,We begin by quoting the author's words:--
875,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,
876,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,'I have studied the poem as if I were going to translate it word
877,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,for word ... but I will not and have not translated it in that
878,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"way, and I will venture to maintain that my translation is a"
879,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"faithful one, historically faithful, inasmuch as I have never"
880,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"wilfully altered or interpolated anything, and poetically faithful"
881,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,inasmuch as I have tried with all my might vividly to express what
882,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,I saw in the poem.... Whoever understands both languages and
883,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"possesses a poetical sense will see what I mean, and whoever is"
884,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"deficient in knowledge or sense, or both, may stick to his own"
885,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"view, if he will only let me stick to mine, which may be weak"
886,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"enough, but is not so utterly devoid of style and poetry as little"
887,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,pettifoggers in the intellectual world maintain because they can
888,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"see very well that my method is not theirs. ""I have,"" said Cicero,"
889,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"""translated Demosthenes, not as a grammarian but as an orator, and"
890,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,therefore have striven not so much to convince as to persuade my
891,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"readers of the truth of his words"": methinks I need no other"
892,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"defence as regards connoisseurs and just judges, and if I am much"
893,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"mistaken in this opinion, then my work is absolutely"
894,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"indefensible[3].' --Pages xxxiv, xxxv."
895,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,
896,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"In the introduction to his text of 1861, Grundtvig speaks of his theory"
897,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"of translation, saying that he gave, as it were, new clothes, new money,"
898,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"and new language to the poor old Seven Sleepers, so that they could"
899,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,associate freely with moderns. He believed that it was necessary to put
900,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,the poem into a form that would seem natural and attractive to the
901,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,"readers of the day. In so doing he departed from the letter of the law,"
902,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,and rewrote the poem according to his own ideas.
903,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,
904,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,In the second edition the author states that he hopes the poem will
905,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,prove acceptable as a reading-book for schools. Its value as a text-book
906,GRUNDTVIG'S TRANSLATION,in patriotism is also alluded to.

985,SJETTE SANG.,
986,SJETTE SANG.,_Criticism of the Translation._
987,SJETTE SANG.,
988,SJETTE SANG.,The poem departs so far from the text of _Beowulf_ that any discussion
989,SJETTE SANG.,of its accuracy would be out of place. As has been shown by the section
990,SJETTE SANG.,"on the nature of the translation, the author had no intention of being"
991,SJETTE SANG.,true to the letter of the text. Grundtvig's scholarship has been
992,SJETTE SANG.,discussed above.
993,SJETTE SANG.,
994,SJETTE SANG.,The translation may properly be called nothing more than a paraphrase.
995,SJETTE SANG.,Whole sentences are introduced that have no connection with the original
996,SJETTE SANG.,"text. Throughout the translation is evident the robust, but not always"
997,SJETTE SANG.,"agreeable, personality of the translator. In his preface[5] Grundtvig"
998,SJETTE SANG.,remarked that he put nothing into his poem that was not historically and
999,SJETTE SANG.,poetically true to the original. The statement can only be regarded as
1000,SJETTE SANG.,an unfortunate exaggeration. Grundtvig's style cannot be called even a
1001,SJETTE SANG.,"faint reflection of the _Beowulf_ style. He has popularized the story,"
1002,SJETTE SANG.,and he has cheapened it. There is no warrant in the original for the
1003,SJETTE SANG.,coarse invective of the extract that has just been cited. In the Old
1004,SJETTE SANG.,"English, Hunferth taunts Beowulf, but he never forgets that his rival is"
1005,SJETTE SANG.,'doughty in battle' (l. 526). Beowulf is always worthy of his respect.
1006,SJETTE SANG.,"In Grundtvig, the taunting degenerates into a scurrilous tirade."
1007,SJETTE SANG.,Hunferth calls Beowulf a 'mudscow'; Breca and Beowulf swim like two
1008,SJETTE SANG.,'dead herrings.' In like manner the character of Hunferth is cheapened.
1009,SJETTE SANG.,"In _Beowulf_ he is a jealous courtier, but he is always heroic. In"
1010,SJETTE SANG.,"Grundtvig he is merely a contemptible braggart, 'with his nose high in"
1011,SJETTE SANG.,"air,' who will not allow himself to be 'thrown to the rubbish heap.'"
1012,SJETTE SANG.,
1013,SJETTE SANG.,The same false manner is retained throughout the poem. In many places it
1014,SJETTE SANG.,reads well--it is often an excellent story. But it can lay no claim to
1015,SJETTE SANG.,historic or poetic fidelity to the _Beowulf_.
1016,SJETTE SANG.,
1017,SJETTE SANG.,
1018,SJETTE SANG.,_Reception of the Book._
1019,SJETTE SANG.,
1020,SJETTE SANG.,The book fell dead from the press. Grundtvig himself tells us that it
1021,SJETTE SANG.,was hardly read outside his own house[6]. Thirty years later he learned
1022,SJETTE SANG.,that the book had never reached the Royal Library at Stockholm. A copy
1023,SJETTE SANG.,"made its way to the British Museum, but it was the one which Grundtvig"
1024,SJETTE SANG.,himself carried thither in 1829. This was doubtless the copy that was
1025,SJETTE SANG.,read and criticized by Thorpe and Wackerbarth. Both of these scholars
1026,SJETTE SANG.,"spoke of its extreme freedom, but commended its readableness."

1061,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,The volume had its origin in the Terminal Lectures which the author gave
1062,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,as Professor of Anglo-Saxon and Poetry at Oxford from 1809 to 1812[1].
1063,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,We know from an autobiographical note printed in the Introduction[2]
1064,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,"that the _Beowulf_ was finished in October, 1820. But the book did not"
1065,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,"appear until two years after the author's death, and the material which"
1066,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,it contains is of a slightly earlier date than the title-page would seem
1067,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,to indicate--e.g. the volume really antedates the third edition of

1073,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,"Conybeare did not edit the entire poem, and apparently never had any"
1074,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,intention of so doing. The selections which he translates are based on
1075,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,"Thorkelin's text. He revises this text, however, in making his"
1076,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,"translations, and even incorporates a collation of Thorkelin's text with"
1077,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,"the MS. (pp. 137-55). This collation, though not complete or accurate,"
1078,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,"was serviceable, and kept Conybeare from falling into some of the errors"
1079,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,that the Icelander had made. He distinguished by an asterisk the MS.
1080,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,readings which were of material importance in giving the sense of a
1081,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,"passage, and, in fact, constructed for himself a text that was"
1082,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,practically new.
1083,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,
1084,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,'The text has been throughout carefully collated with the original
1085,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,"Manuscript, and the translation of Thorkelin revised with all the"
1086,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,diligence of which the editor is capable.' --Page 32.
1087,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,
1088,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,"'Any attempt to restore the metre, and to correct the version"
1089,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,"throughout, would have exceeded the bounds, and involved much"
1090,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,discussion foreign to the purpose of the present work. This must
1091,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,"be left to the labours of the Saxon scholar. It is evident,"
1092,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,"however, that without a more correct text than that of Thorkelin,"
1093,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,those labours must be hopeless. The wish of supplying that
1094,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,"deficiency, may perhaps apologize for the occupying, by this"
1095,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,"Collation, so large a space of a work strictly dedicated to other"
1096,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,"purposes.' --Page 137, footnote."
1097,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,
1098,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,How much Conybeare improved the text may be seen by comparing his text
1099,CONYBEARE'S EXTRACTS,and Latin translation with those of Thorkelin. The first six lines of

1120,CONYBEARE.                    THORKELIN.,It will be seen that in these lines Conybeare has at almost every point

1122,CONYBEARE.                    THORKELIN.,modern texts and translations. But the poem yet awaited a complete
1123,CONYBEARE.                    THORKELIN.,"understanding, for Conybeare could say: 'The Introduction is occupied by"
1124,CONYBEARE.                    THORKELIN.,the praises of Scefing ... and of his son and successor Beowulf. The
1125,CONYBEARE.                    THORKELIN.,embarkation of the former on a piratical expedition is then detailed at
1126,CONYBEARE.                    THORKELIN.,some length. In this expedition (if I rightly understand the text)
1127,CONYBEARE.                    THORKELIN.,"himself and his companions were taken or lost at sea' (p. 35). And, in"
1128,CONYBEARE.                    THORKELIN.,"general, he misses the same points of the story as Thorkelin, although"

1145,CONYBEARE.                    THORKELIN.,"are, in general, nothing more than free paraphrases. Wishing to"
1146,CONYBEARE.                    THORKELIN.,"popularize the _Beowulf_, he used as a medium of translation a"
1147,CONYBEARE.                    THORKELIN.,peculiarly stilted kind of blank verse. He dressed the poem out in

1192,LATIN TRANSLATION.,"be said that, while it attains a kind of dignity, it is not the dignity"
1193,LATIN TRANSLATION.,"of _Beowulf_, for it is self-conscious. Like _Beowulf_ it is elaborate,"
1194,LATIN TRANSLATION.,"but it is the elaboration of art rather than of feeling. Moreover, it is"

1198,LATIN TRANSLATION.,"is utterly foreign to the simple, often baldly simple, ideas and phrases"

1250,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,
1251,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"'The text was an improvement on Thorkelin, but still very"
1252,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,faulty;--to say nothing of inaccuracies from want of proper
1253,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,oversight as the sheets were passing through the press. The
1254,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"Glossary, though short, was a valuable acquisition ... Of this"
1255,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,edition only 100 copies were printed;--and it was a happy
1256,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"limitation, as it left room for a new edition as early as 1835,"
1257,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,in which the text was edited with far greater care. All the rest
1258,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"remained as before, and the Preface was reprinted word for word.'"

1263,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,
1264,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"But whatever may be said of the text of 1833, there is nothing but"
1265,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,praise for the edition of 1835. In this book the poem first had the
1266,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"advantage of a modern scholarly treatment, and for the first time the"
1267,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,text of the MS. was correctly transcribed. It received its first
1268,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"punctuation. For the first time it was properly divided into half-lines,"
1269,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"with attention to alliteration. The text was freely emended, but the"
1270,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"suggested readings were placed in the footnotes, in order not to impair"
1271,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,the value of the text as a reproduction of the MS. The necessity for
1272,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,this was made evident by Kemble himself:--
1273,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,
1274,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"'But while he makes the necessary corrections, no man is justified"
1275,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,in withholding the original readings: for although the laws of a
1276,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"language, ascertained by wide and careful examination of all the"
1277,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"cognate tongues, of the hidden springs and ground-principles upon"
1278,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"which they rest in common, are like the laws of the Medes and"
1279,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"Persians and alter not, yet the very errors of the old writer are"
1280,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"valuable, and serve sometimes as guides and clues to the inner"
1281,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,being and spiritual tendencies of the language itself. The reader
1282,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"will moreover be spared that, to some people, heart-burning"
1283,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,necessity of taking his editor's qualifications too much for
1284,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"granted, if side by side he is allowed to judge of the traditional"
1285,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"error, and the proposed correction. I have endeavoured to"
1286,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"accomplish this end by printing the text, letter for letter,"
1287,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"as I found it.' --Preface, pp. xxiv ff."
1288,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,
1289,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"With this wholesome respect for the tradition of the MS., it is not"
1290,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,strange that Kemble's carefully chosen emendations should stand to-day
1291,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"as of high critical value, and that many of them are retained in modern"
1292,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"editions of the text[1]. When we compare Kemble's book with Thorkelin's,"
1293,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,the advance is seen to be little less than astonishing. Thorkelin's
1294,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,emendations were worse than useless.
1295,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,
1296,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,Kemble had a full acquaintance with the new science of comparative
1297,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,philology which was developing in Germany under Jakob Grimm. He had
1298,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"corresponded, and later studied, with Grimm, and, according to William"
1299,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"Hunt, was the 'recognised exponent' of his investigations[2]. It is to"
1300,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"Grimm that Kemble dedicates his volumes, and to him that he repeatedly"
1301,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,acknowledges his indebtedness. Thus Kemble brought to the study of the
1302,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"poem not only a knowledge of the Old English poetry and prose, but"
1303,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"acquaintance with Old Norse, Gothic, Old High German, and Old Saxon. It"
1304,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,may sufficiently illustrate his scholarly method to instance examples of
1305,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"his treatment of the unique words in _Beowulf_. Take, e.g., the word"
1306,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,_hose_ in line 924. This word does not appear elsewhere in Old English;
1307,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"it does not appear in Lye's _Dictionary_, the only dictionary that was"
1308,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,at Kemble's disposal. Upon this word Kemble brought to bear his
1309,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"knowledge of the Germanic tongues, and by citing Goth. _hansa_, OHG."
1310,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"_hansa_, &c., derived the meaning _turma_--a process in which he is"
1311,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,supported by a modern authority like Kluge. The study of compounds also
1312,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,first began with Kemble. He collected and compared the compounds in
1313,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,_heaðo._. Thus he laid the foundation of all modern studies on the Old
1314,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,English compound.

1318,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,
1319,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,In the 1835 volume twenty-three words were illustrated in the above way.
1320,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,But it remained for the 1837 volume to present a complete glossary of
1321,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"the poem, containing also important poetic words not in _Beowulf_."
1322,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"By reason of its completeness and comparative work, it remained the"
1323,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,standard commentary on the Old English poetic vocabulary until the
1324,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,appearance of Grein's _Sprachschatz_[3].

1327,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,_Aim of Kemble's Translation._
1328,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,
1329,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"Like his edition of the text, Kemble's translation is quite independent"
1330,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"of any preceding book; like his edition of the text, its aim was"
1331,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"faithfulness to the original. He adheres scrupulously to the text, save"
1332,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,where the original is unintelligible. The translation was designed to be
1333,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,used together with the glossary as a part of the apparatus for
1334,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,interpreting the poem. He therefore made it strictly literal.
1335,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,
1336,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"'The translation is a literal one; I was bound to give, word for"
1337,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"word, the original in all its roughness: I might have made it"
1338,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"smoother, but I purposely avoided doing so, because had the Saxon"
1339,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"poet thought as we think, and expressed his thoughts as we express"
1340,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"our thoughts, I might have spared myself the trouble of editing or"
1341,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"translating his poem. A few transpositions of words, &c. caused"
1342,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,principally by the want of inflections in New English (since we
1343,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,have now little more than their position by which to express the
1344,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,relations of words to one another) are all that I have allowed
1345,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,"myself, and where I have inserted words I have generally printed"
1346,KEMBLE'S EDITIONS,them in italics.' --

1376,VIII.,
1377,VIII.,Kemble's scholarship enabled him to get a full understanding of the
1378,VIII.,"poem, and thus to make the first really adequate translation of"
1379,VIII.,"_Beowulf_. He was the first to recognize the significance of kenning,"
1380,VIII.,"metaphor, and compound. Thus his work is to be commended chiefly because"
1381,VIII.,of its faithfulness. All preceding studies had been wofully
1382,VIII.,inaccurate[7]. Kemble's editions became at once the authoritative
1383,VIII.,"commentary on the text, and held this position until the appearance of"
1384,VIII.,"Grein's _Bibliothek_ (1857). In this latter book, Kemble's text was the"
1385,VIII.,principal authority used in correcting the work of Thorpe[8]. In spite
1386,VIII.,"of the fact that this is a literal translation, it sometimes attains"
1387,VIII.,strength and beauty by reason of its very simplicity.

1425,ETTMÜLLER'S TRANSLATION,"Ernst Moritz Ludwig Ettmüller (1802-77), at the time of the publication"
1426,ETTMÜLLER'S TRANSLATION,"of this book, was professor of the German language and literature in the"
1427,ETTMÜLLER'S TRANSLATION,Gymnasium at Zürich. He had already appeared as a translator with a work
1428,ETTMÜLLER'S TRANSLATION,entitled _Lieder der Edda von den Nibelungen_. Later he edited
1429,ETTMÜLLER'S TRANSLATION,selections from the _Beowulf_ in his _Engla and Seaxna Scôpas and
1430,ETTMÜLLER'S TRANSLATION,Bôceras_ (1850). This text incorporated many new readings. Ettmüller was
1431,ETTMÜLLER'S TRANSLATION,"the first to question the unity of the _Beowulf_, and sketched a theory"
1432,ETTMÜLLER'S TRANSLATION,of interpolations which has since been developed by Müllenhoff. The
1433,ETTMÜLLER'S TRANSLATION,first announcement of these views is found in the introduction to this

1441,ETTMÜLLER'S TRANSLATION,"'Vor Allem habe ich so wörtlich als möglich übersetzt, da Treue"
1442,ETTMÜLLER'S TRANSLATION,das erste Erforderniss einer guten Übersetzung ist. Dann aber war
1443,ETTMÜLLER'S TRANSLATION,mein Augenmerk vorzüglich auf Wohlklang und Verständlichkeit
1444,ETTMÜLLER'S TRANSLATION,gerichtet. Letztere werden bei Übersetzungen dieser Art nur zu oft
1445,ETTMÜLLER'S TRANSLATION,"vernachlässigt, da manche der Ansicht sind, ihre Arbeit sei um so"
1446,ETTMÜLLER'S TRANSLATION,"besser, je treuer sie die äussere Form des Originals in allen"
1447,ETTMÜLLER'S TRANSLATION,Einzelheiten wiedergebe. Aber dieweil diese so mühsam an der
1448,ETTMÜLLER'S TRANSLATION,"Schale knacken, entschlüpft ihnen nicht selten der Kern. Mein"
1449,ETTMÜLLER'S TRANSLATION,"Bestreben war demnach keineswegs, z.B. jeden Vers ängstlich dem"
1450,ETTMÜLLER'S TRANSLATION,"Originale nachzubilden, so dass die genaueste Übereinstimmung"
1451,ETTMÜLLER'S TRANSLATION,zwischen der Silbenzahl und den Hebungen oder gar dem Klange der
1452,ETTMÜLLER'S TRANSLATION,"Verse Statt fände. Das wäre ohnehin, ohne der deutschen Sprache"
1453,ETTMÜLLER'S TRANSLATION,"die schreiendste Gewalt anzuthun, unmöglich gewesen. Ich habe"
1454,ETTMÜLLER'S TRANSLATION,"vielmehr darnach mit Sorgfalt gestrebt, die Versbildung des"

1511,EXTRACT.,_Criticism of the Translation._
1512,EXTRACT.,
1513,EXTRACT.,"In his translation Ettmüller followed in the steps of Kemble[2], but he"
1514,EXTRACT.,was not slavishly dependent upon him. At times he disagrees with the
1515,EXTRACT.,"English scholar (cp. e.g., ll. 468, 522, 1331), and offers a translation"
1516,EXTRACT.,"of the passage omitted by him, 3069-74. In general, the translation is"
1517,EXTRACT.,"strictly literal, and follows the original almost line for line."
1518,EXTRACT.,
1519,EXTRACT.,It was probably well for Ettmüller that he made his translation thus
1520,EXTRACT.,literal. In the history of a foreign-language study there is a period
1521,EXTRACT.,"when it is best that a translation should be strictly literal, for such"
1522,EXTRACT.,a work is bound to be called into service as a part of the critical
1523,EXTRACT.,apparatus for the interpretation of the tongue. If the early translation
1524,EXTRACT.,"is not thus literal, it is sure to be superseded later by the more"
1525,EXTRACT.,"faithful rendering, as Schaldemose's superseded Grundtvig's in"
1526,EXTRACT.,Denmark[3]. It is not until criticism and scholarship have done their
1527,EXTRACT.,strictly interpretative work that a translation is safe in attempting to
1528,EXTRACT.,render the spirit rather than the letter of the original. The reason for
1529,EXTRACT.,this is evident: no real appreciation of the spirit is possible until
1530,EXTRACT.,scholarship has provided the means for discovering it.
1531,EXTRACT.,
1532,EXTRACT.,"By the publication of this volume, therefore, Ettmüller did for German"
1533,EXTRACT.,scholarship what Kemble had done for English and Schaldemose was to do
1534,EXTRACT.,for Danish scholarship. Yet he might with propriety have made his work
1535,EXTRACT.,more simple. His translation is disfigured by numerous strange
1536,EXTRACT.,word-combinations which he often transcribed literally from the
1537,EXTRACT.,"original, e.g. _beadu-runen_ in the third line of the extract. It is"
1538,EXTRACT.,safe to say that none but a scholar in Old English would be able to
1539,EXTRACT.,"understand this word--if, indeed, we may call it a word. The text is"
1540,EXTRACT.,full of such forms. The author is obliged to append notes explaining his
1541,EXTRACT.,own translation! He apparently forgets that it is his business as
1542,EXTRACT.,translator to render the difficult words as well as the simple ones. In
1543,EXTRACT.,"Ettmüller's case it was especially unfortunate, because it gave others"
1544,EXTRACT.,"an opportunity to come forward later with simpler, and hence more"
1545,EXTRACT.,"useful, translations."

1549,EXTRACT.,
1550,EXTRACT.,"The book had no extraordinary success. A reprint was never called for,"
1551,EXTRACT.,"and was perhaps hardly to be expected, considering the existence of"
1552,EXTRACT.,"Kemble's volumes. Moreover, the translation was not accompanied by an"
1553,EXTRACT.,"edition of the text. Grein[4], the next German scholar, took his"
1554,EXTRACT.,inspiration from Kemble[5] and Thorpe[6] rather than from Ettmüller.

1584,SCHALDEMOSE'S TRANSLATION,
1585,SCHALDEMOSE'S TRANSLATION,In this book the Old English text and the Danish translation were
1586,SCHALDEMOSE'S TRANSLATION,"printed in parallel columns. The text, which was taken literally from"
1587,SCHALDEMOSE'S TRANSLATION,"Kemble[1], need not detain us here. No mention is made of the work of"
1588,SCHALDEMOSE'S TRANSLATION,"Leo[2], Ettmüller[3], or of the 1837 volume of Kemble, although the"
1589,SCHALDEMOSE'S TRANSLATION,"influence of the latter is evident throughout the book, as will be shown"
1590,SCHALDEMOSE'S TRANSLATION,"below. The notes are drawn largely from the works of preceding scholars,"
1591,SCHALDEMOSE'S TRANSLATION,and in these the author makes an occasional acknowledgement of
1592,SCHALDEMOSE'S TRANSLATION,indebtedness.
1593,SCHALDEMOSE'S TRANSLATION,
1594,SCHALDEMOSE'S TRANSLATION,The translation is literal. Grundtvig's translation[4] had been so
1595,SCHALDEMOSE'S TRANSLATION,"paraphrastic as often to obscure the sense, and always the spirit,"
1596,SCHALDEMOSE'S TRANSLATION,of the original. Schaldemose had the advantage of presenting the most
1597,SCHALDEMOSE'S TRANSLATION,modern text side by side with the translation. Thus the book became a
1598,SCHALDEMOSE'S TRANSLATION,valuable _apparatus criticus_ for the Danish student.

1606,SCHALDEMOSE'S TRANSLATION,literary work; but a large part of his life had been spent in military
1607,SCHALDEMOSE'S TRANSLATION,"service, in which he had had many exciting adventures by land and sea."
1608,SCHALDEMOSE'S TRANSLATION,After leaving his professorship he again entered military service.

1611,SCHALDEMOSE'S TRANSLATION,"His interest in _Beowulf_ seems to have been, like that of Thorkelin[5],"

1613,SCHALDEMOSE'S TRANSLATION,"a collection of Heroic Danish Songs, ancient and modern. It was"
1614,SCHALDEMOSE'S TRANSLATION,doubtless a desire to add to this collection that led him to undertake
1615,SCHALDEMOSE'S TRANSLATION,an edition of the _Beowulf_.

1678,EXTRACT.,
1679,EXTRACT.,There are two good things to be said of this volume: it contains a
1680,EXTRACT.,"literal translation, and it is a literal translation from Kemble's text."
1681,EXTRACT.,"Being so, it could not be without merit. There was need of a literal"
1682,EXTRACT.,translation in Denmark. Grundtvig's version certainly did not fulfil the
1683,EXTRACT.,"letter of the law, and Thorkelin's had long since been forgotten."
1684,EXTRACT.,
1685,EXTRACT.,Schaldemose's dependence upon the translation of Kemble is very evident.
1686,EXTRACT.,"In general, the Danish translator is stopped by the same passages that"
1687,EXTRACT.,"defy the English translator, e.g. the passage which Kemble failed to"
1688,EXTRACT.,interpret at line 3075 was duly and loyally omitted by Schaldemose.
1689,EXTRACT.,
1690,EXTRACT.,I can find no evidence for the reiterated[6] statement that Schaldemose
1691,EXTRACT.,is throughout his translation slavishly indebted to Ettmüller. Certain
1692,EXTRACT.,it is that he avoided those peculiar forms of Ettmüller's translation
1693,EXTRACT.,which are nothing more than a transliteration from the Old English.
1694,EXTRACT.,
1695,EXTRACT.,
1696,EXTRACT.,_Reception of the Volume._
1697,EXTRACT.,
1698,EXTRACT.,It is a tribute to the Danish interest in Beowulf that Schaldemose's
1699,EXTRACT.,volume soon passed into a second edition. But it was not of a character
1700,EXTRACT.,"to arouse the interest of scholars in other countries. Thorpe, the next"
1701,EXTRACT.,"editor of the poem, had never seen it."
1702,EXTRACT.,
1703,EXTRACT.,"The translation, being strictly literal, naturally commanded very little"
1704,EXTRACT.,attention even in Denmark; while it was utterly without interest for
1705,EXTRACT.,readers and students in other countries.

1741,WACKERBARTH'S TRANSLATION,"Text in 1833 I formed the Design of translating it, and early in"
1742,WACKERBARTH'S TRANSLATION,1837 I commenced the Work. Mr. Kemble's second Volume had not then

1834,CANTO VIII.,
1835,CANTO VIII.,
1836,CANTO VIII.,_Criticism of the Translation._
1837,CANTO VIII.,
1838,CANTO VIII.,Wackerbarth's translation is not to be considered as a rival of
1839,CANTO VIII.,Kemble's[1]--the author did not wish it to be so considered. Kemble
1840,CANTO VIII.,addressed the world of scholars; Wackerbarth the world of readers.
1841,CANTO VIII.,Wackerbarth rather resembles Conybeare[2] in trying to reproduce the
1842,CANTO VIII.,"_spirit_ of the poem, and make his book appeal to a popular audience."
1843,CANTO VIII.,Wackerbarth had the advantage of basing his translation on the accurate
1844,CANTO VIII.,and scholarly version of Kemble; yet Conybeare and Wackerbarth were
1845,CANTO VIII.,equally unsuccessful in catching the spirit of the original. The reason
1846,CANTO VIII.,for their failure is primarily in the media which they chose. It would
1847,CANTO VIII.,seem that if there were a measure less suited to the Beowulf style than
1848,CANTO VIII.,"the Miltonic blank verse used by Conybeare, it would be the ballad"
1849,CANTO VIII.,"measures used by Wackerbarth. The movement of the ballad is easy, rapid,"
1850,CANTO VIII.,"and garrulous. Now, if there are three qualities of which the _Beowulf_"
1851,CANTO VIII.,"is not possessed, they are ease, rapidity, and garrulity. Not only does"
1852,CANTO VIII.,the poet avoid superfluous words--the ballad never does--but he
1853,CANTO VIII.,frequently does not use words enough. His meaning is thus often vague
1854,CANTO VIII.,"and nebulous, or harsh and knotted. Nor can the poem properly be called"
1855,CANTO VIII.,"rapid. It is often hurried, and more often insufficient in detail, but"
1856,CANTO VIII.,it never has sustained rapidity. The kenning alone is hostile to
1857,CANTO VIII.,rapidity. The poet lingers lovingly over his thought as if loath to
1858,CANTO VIII.,"leave it; he repeats, amplifies. The description of Grendel's approach"
1859,CANTO VIII.,to Heorot is given three times within twenty lines.
1860,CANTO VIII.,
1861,CANTO VIII.,Now these features which have just been described Wackerbarth's ballad
1862,CANTO VIII.,lines are eminently unfitted to transmit. But there is still another
1863,CANTO VIII.,reason for shunning them. They are almost continuously suggestive of
1864,CANTO VIII.,Scott. Of all men else the translator of _Beowulf_ should avoid Scott.
1865,CANTO VIII.,Scott's medievalism is hundreds of years and miles away from the
1866,CANTO VIII.,"medievalism of _Beowulf_. His is the self-conscious, dramatic, gorgeous"
1867,CANTO VIII.,"age of chivalry, of knight and lady, of pomp and pride. _Beowulf_ is"
1868,CANTO VIII.,simple to bareness.
1869,CANTO VIII.,
1870,CANTO VIII.,It is in such strong picturesque passages as the swimming-match that
1871,CANTO VIII.,"Wackerbarth's style is worst. There is a plethora of adjectives,"
1872,CANTO VIII.,scarcely one of which is found in the original; but they are of no
1873,CANTO VIII.,avail--they are too commonplace to render the strength and raciness of
1874,CANTO VIII.,"the original words. There is too much ballad padding--'then he cry'd,'"
1875,CANTO VIII.,"'at last,' 'well and faithfully,' 'onslaught dire, and deadly fight.'"
1876,CANTO VIII.,Hunferth prattles. The heroic atmosphere is gone.
1877,CANTO VIII.,
1878,CANTO VIII.,"In passages calling for calmness, solemnity, or elevation of"
1879,CANTO VIII.,thought--and there are many such--the easy flow of a verse monotonous
1880,CANTO VIII.,and trivial effectually destroys the beauty of the lines.
1881,CANTO VIII.,
1882,CANTO VIII.,"But in spite of its very evident limitations, Wackerbarth's translation"
1883,CANTO VIII.,"was a move in the right direction. His aim, in his own words, was to"
1884,CANTO VIII.,"'get his book read,' and he was wise in choosing a medium that would be"
1885,CANTO VIII.,"popular, even if it were not satisfactory to the scholar. It was better"
1886,CANTO VIII.,to have _Beowulf_ according to Wackerbarth than no _Beowulf_ at all.

1909,THORPE'S EDITION,
1910,THORPE'S EDITION,"'Twenty-four years have passed since, while residing in Denmark,"
1911,THORPE'S EDITION,I first entertained the design of one day producing an edition of
1912,THORPE'S EDITION,"Beowulf; and it was in prosecution of that design that,"
1913,THORPE'S EDITION,"immediately on my arrival in England in 1830, I carefully collated"
1914,THORPE'S EDITION,the text of Thorkelin's edition with the Cottonian manuscript.
1915,THORPE'S EDITION,"Fortunately, no doubt, for the work, a series of cares, together"
1916,THORPE'S EDITION,"with other literary engagements, intervened and arrested my"
1917,THORPE'S EDITION,"progress. I had, in fact, abandoned every thought of ever resuming"
1918,THORPE'S EDITION,the task: it was therefore with no slight pleasure that I hailed
1919,THORPE'S EDITION,the appearance of Mr. Kemble's first edition of the text of
1920,THORPE'S EDITION,Beowulf in 1833....
1921,THORPE'S EDITION,
1922,THORPE'S EDITION,'Copies of Mr. Kemble's editions having for some time past been of
1923,THORPE'S EDITION,"rare occurrence, I resolved on resuming my suspended labour, and,"
1924,THORPE'S EDITION,"as far as I was able, supplying a want felt by many an Anglo-Saxon"
1925,THORPE'S EDITION,student both at home and abroad....
1926,THORPE'S EDITION,
1927,THORPE'S EDITION,'My first impulse was to print the text of the poem as it appears
1928,THORPE'S EDITION,"in the manuscript, with a literal translation in parallel columns,"
1929,THORPE'S EDITION,"placing all conjectural emendations at the foot of each page; but,"
1930,THORPE'S EDITION,"on comparing the text with the version in this juxta-position,"
1931,THORPE'S EDITION,so numerous and so enormous and puerile did the blunders of the
1932,THORPE'S EDITION,"copyist appear, and, consequently, so great the discrepance"
1933,THORPE'S EDITION,"between the text and the translation, that I found myself"
1934,THORPE'S EDITION,compelled to admit into the text the greater number of the
1935,THORPE'S EDITION,"conjectural emendations, consigning to the foot of the page the"
1936,THORPE'S EDITION,corresponding readings of the manuscript. In every case which I
1937,THORPE'S EDITION,"thought might by others be considered questionable, I have"
1938,THORPE'S EDITION,"followed the more usual course, of retaining in the text the"
1939,THORPE'S EDITION,"reading of the manuscript, and placing the proposed correction at"
1940,THORPE'S EDITION,foot....
1941,THORPE'S EDITION,

1943,THORPE'S EDITION,still further detriment.

1950,THORPE'S EDITION,_Criticism of Thorpe's Text._
1951,THORPE'S EDITION,
1952,THORPE'S EDITION,Considering the amount of time that had elapsed between this and the
1953,THORPE'S EDITION,"edition of Kemble[1], Thorpe can hardly be said to have made a"
1954,THORPE'S EDITION,satisfactory advance. In some respects his edition is actually inferior
1955,THORPE'S EDITION,"to Kemble's. It is probable, for example, that the collation of which"
1956,THORPE'S EDITION,the author speaks in his introduction was the one which he had made
1957,THORPE'S EDITION,"twenty years before, and that, in taking up his work a second time,"
1958,THORPE'S EDITION,"he did not trouble himself to revise it. At any rate, the MS. did not"
1959,THORPE'S EDITION,receive from Thorpe that respectful attention that it had had from
1960,THORPE'S EDITION,Kemble. Thorpe was more clever than the former scholar in deciphering
1961,THORPE'S EDITION,"faded lines of the MS., but he was not always careful to indicate those"
1962,THORPE'S EDITION,"letters which he actually found there, and those he himself supplied"
1963,THORPE'S EDITION,from conjecture. Yet these readings were often of sufficient importance
1964,THORPE'S EDITION,"to affect an entire passage, and later scholarship has in many cases"
1965,THORPE'S EDITION,deciphered readings whose sense is entirely different from Thorpe's.
1966,THORPE'S EDITION,"Thus his edition presents striking divergences from later texts, while"
1967,THORPE'S EDITION,no explanation of them is offered in the footnotes. Not only does he
1968,THORPE'S EDITION,frequently incorporate his own readings in the text without noting the
1969,THORPE'S EDITION,"MS. forms, but he even makes mistakes in the MS. forms which he does"
1970,THORPE'S EDITION,note. A collation of Thorpe's text with the MS. has revealed a
1971,THORPE'S EDITION,carelessness which was all the more reprehensible in that it came from a
1972,THORPE'S EDITION,scholar who was thought to be well-nigh infallible. A few examples of
1973,THORPE'S EDITION,this carelessness are given:--
1974,THORPE'S EDITION,
1975,THORPE'S EDITION,"Line 319 (158)[2], _banan_ (misreads MS. in footnote)."
1976,THORPE'S EDITION,"487 (241), _Ic_ (word emended from _le_ without noting MS. form)."
1977,THORPE'S EDITION,"1160 (578), _hwæþere_ (emends without noting the MS. form)."
1978,THORPE'S EDITION,"1207 (601), _ac him_ (omits a word)."
1979,THORPE'S EDITION,"4408 (2201), _hilde hlemmum_ (MS. misread in a footnote."
1980,THORPE'S EDITION,Emendation unnecessary).
1981,THORPE'S EDITION,
1982,THORPE'S EDITION,"At line 2218 the MS., badly mutilated at this point, reads,"
1983,THORPE'S EDITION,
1984,THORPE'S EDITION,_... slæpende be syre ... de þeofes cræfte._
1985,THORPE'S EDITION,
1986,THORPE'S EDITION,"In Thorpe's edition the line reads (4443),"
1987,THORPE'S EDITION,
1988,THORPE'S EDITION,"_... slæpende be fire, fyrena hyrde þeófes cræfte._"
1989,THORPE'S EDITION,
1990,THORPE'S EDITION,"Not only does he fail to state that he has changed MS. _sy_ to _fi_, but"
1991,THORPE'S EDITION,he gives no indication that for the words _fyrena hyrde_ there is no
1992,THORPE'S EDITION,"room in the MS., and that the reading is entirely of his own making."

2021,THORPE.                           KEMBLE.,Thorpe's edition. Thorpe is seen to have the advantage in deciphering
2022,THORPE.                           KEMBLE.,"certain parts of the text, see e.g. lines 9, 11, 17. On the other hand,"
2023,THORPE.                           KEMBLE.,Kemble is far more conscientious. Thus at line 13 Thorpe reads _ne_ as
2024,THORPE.                           KEMBLE.,"if it were found in the MS. It is not there, and Kemble is right in"
2025,THORPE.                           KEMBLE.,inclosing the letters in parentheses. The same thing is true of _F[´æ]r_
2026,THORPE.                           KEMBLE.,"in line 19, and Gren{dl}es in line 14. Thorpe's emendations in lines 3"
2027,THORPE.                           KEMBLE.,"and 5 are an advance on Kemble, and are still retained in the text. But"
2028,THORPE.                           KEMBLE.,Thorpe might have followed Kemble's punctuation in 18 and 19 to his

2091,VIII.,
2092,VIII.,"This being a strictly literal translation, the reader is referred to the"
2093,VIII.,sections on the text for a valuation and criticism. It is a question
2094,VIII.,whether there was need for another literal rendering in England at this
2095,VIII.,"time. Kemble's translation was not yet out of date, and with Thorpe's"
2096,VIII.,new glossary the student had a sufficient apparatus for the
2097,VIII.,interpretation of the poem.
2098,VIII.,
2099,VIII.,Some German scholars have discovered that the short lines in which
2100,VIII.,Thorpe's translation is couched are imitative of the Old English
2101,VIII.,measure. I am unable to agree with them. Probably any short-line
2102,VIII.,translation would _ipso facto_ assume a choppiness not dissimilar to the
2103,VIII.,"Old English, and probably plenty of lines could be discovered which"
2104,VIII.,"correspond well enough to the 'five types,' but the agreement seems"
2105,VIII.,purely fortuitous. It is quite unlikely that Thorpe intended any
2106,VIII.,imitation.

2111,VIII.,The influence of this edition has been considerable. It was the
2112,VIII.,principal authority used by Grein[4] and Heyne[5] in constructing their
2113,VIII.,texts. Thus its influence was felt in all texts down to the publication
2114,VIII.,of the Zupitza _Autotypes_ (1882). Thomas Arnold[6] copied the text
2115,VIII.,almost word for word.

2146,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,
2147,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,Christian Wilhelm Michael Grein[1] (1825-77) was eminently well fitted
2148,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,for the editing and translating of Old English poetry. He possessed a
2149,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"natural aptitude for the study of Germanic Philology, and had the"
2150,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"advantage of studying with an excellent professor, Franz Eduard"
2151,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"Christoph Dietrich (1810-83), in the University at Marburg. As early as"
2152,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,1854 he began his labors as a translator of Old English poetry with a
2153,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"version of the _Phoenix_, 'Der Vogel Phoenix: ein angelsächsisches"
2154,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"Gedicht, stabreimend übersetzt,' Rinteln, 1854. In the same year he"
2155,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,printed a translation of the _Heliand_.
2156,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,
2157,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,In 1855 he assumed the position of Praktikant at the Kassel
2158,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,Landesbibliothek. Here he was able to devote a large part of his
2159,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"attention to the study of Old English, acquiring a familiarity with the"
2160,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,poetry of that tongue which it has seldom been the fortune of a scholar
2161,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,to surpass. He formed the design of editing and translating the entire
2162,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,body of Old English poetry and appending to it a complete glossary which
2163,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"should not only give the meanings of the words, but instance every"
2164,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,occurrence of the word. This design he carried out between the years
2165,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,1857 and 1864.

2167,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,
2168,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,_Grein's Texts._
2169,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,
2170,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,The text of _Beowulf_ is found in Grein's _Bibliothek der
2171,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"angelsächsichen Poesie_, Erster Band, Göttingen, 1857, where it occupies"
2172,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"pp. 255-341. A second edition, several times re-edited, is _Beovulf,"
2173,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"nebst den Fragmenten Finnsburg und Waldere_, Kassel und Göttingen, 1867."
2174,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,
2175,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,Grein never saw the MS. of the poem[2]. He based his text on a collation
2176,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"of all the preceding editions. This was unfortunate, because, had Grein"
2177,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"seen the MS., he would doubtless have hastened to make a correct"
2178,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"transcription of it. As it was, his edition necessarily shares some of"
2179,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"the faults of its predecessors, since the text had never yet been"
2180,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,accurately transcribed. A simple illustration of this defect may be seen
2181,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"by examining line 2218 of the text, where Grein reads,"
2182,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,
2183,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"_be fire, fyrena hyrde_,"
2184,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,
2185,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"following Thorpe[3]. As has been pointed out, this is an impossible"
2186,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"reading, and one for which there is no justification in the MS. Thorpe,"
2187,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"however, had presented it as the MS. reading, and Grein could not but"
2188,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,copy it.
2189,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,
2190,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"Like Kemble, Grein had a supreme respect for the readings of the MS.,"
2191,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,and he announced his intention of following this reading wherever
2192,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,possible:--
2193,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,

2202,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,
2203,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"This was wise. Since the days of Kemble, emendation had become"
2204,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,unnecessarily frequent. We have seen in what a light-hearted way Thorpe
2205,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"spoke of the 'blunders of the scribes,' and how careless he was in the"
2206,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,preparation of his text. The dialect had not yet received proper

2208,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,
2209,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"Grein was extremely clever in filling the lacunae of the MS., and his"

2212,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,Still another improvement which he introduced was the full punctuation
2213,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,of the text; this was superior to any that had preceded it. In previous

2218,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,_Theory of Translation._
2219,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,
2220,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,Grein's theory of translation is sufficiently expressed in the Vorrede
2221,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,to the _Dichtungen_:--
2222,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,
2223,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,'Die Sammlung von metrischen Uebersetzungen angelsächsischer
2224,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"Dichtungen, deren erster Band hiermit der Oeffentlichkeit"
2225,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"übergeben wird, soll einen doppelten Zweck erfüllen. Einerseits"
2226,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"betrachte ich dieselben als eine wesentliche Ergänzung, gleichsam"
2227,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,als fortlaufenden Commentar zu meiner gleichzeitig in demselben
2228,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"Verlag erscheinenden Textausgabe der angelsächsischen Dichter,"
2229,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"indem sie meine Interpretation der Originaltexte, worin ich oft"
2230,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"von meinen Vorgängern abweiche, einfach vor Augen legen."
2231,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,Andrerseits aber bezweckte ich dadurch die Bekanntschaft mit den
2232,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,in vieler Beziehung so herrlichen dichterischen Erzeugnissen des
2233,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,uns engverwandten englischen Volkes aus der Zeit vor dem
2234,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,gewaltsamen Eindringen des romanischen Elements durch die
2235,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"normannische Eroberung auch in weiteren Kreisen anzubahnen, was"
2236,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,sie sowol nach ihrem Inhalte als auch nach der poetischen
2237,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,Behandlung des Stoffes gewiss in hohem Grade verdienen. Daher war
2238,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"ich eifrigst bemüht, die Uebersetzung dem Original in möglichster"
2239,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"Treue nach Inhalt, Ausdruck und Form eng anzuschliessen:"
2240,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"namentlich suchte ich, soweit es immer bei dem heutigen Stande"
2241,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"unserer Sprache thunlich war, auch den Rhythmus des Originals"
2242,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"nachzubilden, wobei es vor allem auf die Beibehaltung der"
2243,GREIN'S TRANSLATIONS,"eigentümlichen Stellung der Stabreime ankam, ein Punkt, der bei"

2325,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,
2326,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,Dr. Karl Simrock (1802-1876) brought to the translation of _Beowulf_ the
2327,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,"thorough knowledge of a scholar, the fine feeling and technique of a"
2328,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,"poet, and an enviable reputation as a translator of Old German poetry."
2329,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,"At the time when he made his translation of _Beowulf_, he was Professor"
2330,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,"of Old German Literature at Bonn, whither he had been called because of"
2331,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,his contributions to the study of Old German mythology. His title to
2332,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,"remembrance rests, however, on his metrical rendering of the"
2333,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,"_Nibelungenlied_, a work which, in 1892, had passed into its"
2334,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,"fifty-second edition. As an original poet, Simrock is remembered for his"
2335,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,"_Wieland der Schmied_ (1835), and _Gedichte_ (1844)."
2336,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,
2337,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,
2338,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,_Object of the Translation._
2339,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,
2340,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,Simrock wished to do for _Beowulf_ what he had done for the
2341,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,"_Nibelungenlied_, _Walther von der Vogelweide_, and _Der arme Heinrich_."
2342,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,"He objected to the too literal work of Ettmüller[1] and Grein[2], hoping"
2343,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,in his own work to make the poem readable and to dispense with a 'note
2344,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,for every third word':
2345,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,
2346,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,"'Geist und Stimmung einer fernen Heldenzeit anklingen zu lassen,"
2347,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,und doch dem Ausdruck die frische Farbe des Lebens zu verleihen.'
2348,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,"--Vorrede, iii."
2349,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,
2350,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,In this ambition he was justified by his success as a translator of Old
2351,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,German poetry.
2352,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,
2353,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,
2354,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,_Nature of the Translation._
2355,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,
2356,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,"The diction of the version is, on the whole, characterized by simplicity"
2357,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,"and ease. Yet the author, like many another translator of Old English,"
2358,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,tries to give his style an archaic tinge by preserving the compound
2359,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,"forms characteristic of that language, such as Lustholz, Aelgelage,"
2360,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,"Kampfrunen, a fault that Ettmüller had carried to excess. These forms he"
2361,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,"sometimes used to the exclusion of simpler, or even more literal, words."
2362,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,"The nature of the German language, however, keeps these from being as"
2363,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,"repulsive as they are in English, but they are sufficiently strange to"
2364,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,mystify and annoy the reader.
2365,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,
2366,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,The feature of his translation for which Simrock was most concerned was
2367,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,the measure:
2368,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,
2369,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,"'Vor Allem aber den Wohllaut, der echter Poesie unzertrennlich"
2370,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,"verbunden ist, das schien mir die erste Bedingung, damit der Leser"
2371,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,... den Sinn ahne und von der Schönheit des Gedichts ergriffen
2372,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,von Blatt zu Blatt getragen werde. Nur so glaubte ich eine
2373,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,tausendjährige Kluft überbrücken und dieser mit Angeln und Sachsen
2374,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,ausgewanderten Dichtung neues Heimatsrecht bei uns erwerben zu
2375,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,"können.' --Vorrede, iii, iv."
2376,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,
2377,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,"He also preserved alliteration, believing that a fondness for that"
2378,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,"poetic adornment may be easily acquired, and that it is by no means"
2379,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,inconsistent with the genius of modern tongues.

2381,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,
2382,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,_Relation of Translation and other Parts of the Book._
2383,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,
2384,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,The notes to the translation contain discussions of the episodes and of
2385,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,the mythological personages of the poem. There is a discussion of the
2386,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,"poetic worth of _Beowulf_, and an argument for the German origin of the"
2387,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,"poem. But the translation is the _raison d'être_ of the volume, and"
2388,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,other parts are strictly subordinated to it. The Finnsburg fragment is
2389,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,inserted at the end of section 16. As the author does not wish to
2390,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,"disturb the order of _Beowulf_, he is obliged to place the poem at the"
2391,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,"end of the Finnsburg episode (in _Beowulf_), a very ill-chosen position,"
2392,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,where it can only confuse the general reader more than the obscure lines
2393,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,to which it is related. This practice of inserting the Finnsburg
2394,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,"fragment, lately revived by Hoffmann[3], has been generally repudiated."

2397,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,"_Text, and Indebtedness to Preceding Scholars._"
2398,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,
2399,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,The text followed is Grein's (1857)[4]. The translator acknowledges his
2400,SIMROCK'S TRANSLATION,indebtedness to the versions of Ettmüller and Grein.

2439,8. HUNFERD.,"moreover, a simple and readable version, though in these respects it is"

2443,8. HUNFERD.,This is surprising when we consider the success of Simrock's previous

2445,8. HUNFERD.,(1) Simrock's reputation as a scholar was not equal to that of Grein or

2479,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,The name of Moritz Heyne is one of the most illustrious in the history
2480,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,of Beowulf scholarship. The Heyne editions of the text[1] have been
2481,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,"standard for nearly forty years, while the translation has been recently"
2482,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,"reprinted (1898). Beside his work on the _Beowulf_, this scholar was to"
2483,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,"become prominent as editor of the _Heliand_ and of _Ulfilas_, and as one"
2484,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,of the staff appointed to complete Grimm's Dictionary.
2485,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,
2486,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,"At the time when he printed his edition of the _Beowulf,_ Heyne was a"
2487,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,"student at Halle, and but twenty-six years of age (born 1837)[2]. In his"
2488,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,work he had some assistance from Professor Leo[3] of Halle.

2491,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,_Relation of Text and Translation._
2492,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,
2493,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,The translation was founded on the text of 1863. At the time it was by
2494,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,far the best edition that had yet appeared. It was furnished with an
2495,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,excellent glossary. The text had the advantage of the valuable work done
2496,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,by Grundtvig[4] in collating the two transcripts made by Thorkelin[5].
2497,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,It thus came a stage nearer the MS. readings than any other existing
2498,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,"edition, while it avoided the unnecessary conjectures of the Danish"
2499,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,editor.
2500,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,
2501,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,"Heyne's text having been five times re-edited, the first edition of the"
2502,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,translation often fails to conform to readings which have been

2504,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,translation makes this of no great importance.

2541,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,"Heyne chose a new medium for his version, the unrimed iambic line. His"
2542,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,"aim being to get his book read, he avoided a literal translation, and"
2543,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,"rendered with commendable freedom, though not with inaccuracy. He used"
2544,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,"no strange compounds, and shunned an unnatural verse. Thus he produced"
2545,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,the most readable translation that has ever appeared in Germany. Of his
2546,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,own attempt he says--
2547,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,
2548,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,"'Die vorliegende Uebertragung ist so frei, dass sie das für uns"
2549,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,schwer oder gar nicht genau nachzubildende allitterierende Versmass
2550,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,"des Originals gegen fünffüssige Jamben aufgibt, und zu Gunsten des"
2551,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,Sinnes sich der angelsächsischen Wort- und Satzstellung nicht zu
2552,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,"ängstlich anschmiegt; dagegen auch wieder so genau, dass sie"
2553,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,hoffentlich ein Scherflein zum vollkommenern Verständniss des
2554,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,"Textes beitragen wird.' --Vorwort, iii."
2555,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,
2556,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,Heyne's theory of translation is one that has been very little in vogue
2557,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,in Germany. He has been criticized on all sides for his freedom. Yet the
2558,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,criticism is undeserved. Heyne is never paraphrastic--he never adds
2559,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,anything foreign to the poem. He merely believes in translating the
2560,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,obscure as well as the simple ideas of his text. His 'freedom' seldom
2561,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,amounts to more than this--
2562,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,
2563,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,"H[-e] b[-e]ot ne [-a]leh, l. 80 (he belied not his promise)"
2564,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,"Was er gelobt, erfüllt er."
2565,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,
2566,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,"He occasionally inserts a word for metrical reasons, and sometimes, in"
2567,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,"the interests of clearness, a demonstrative or personal pronoun, or even"
2568,HEYNE'S TRANSLATION,a proper name (cf. l. 500 of the extract).

2603,IX.,
2604,IX.,The extract illustrates sufficiently the characteristics of Heyne's
2605,IX.,"rendering. In the first place, attention may be called to the extreme"
2606,IX.,"freedom of the verse, a freedom which at times makes the composition"
2607,IX.,"verge upon prose. In the second place, the translation of the Old"
2608,IX.,"English phrase _beadu-runen onband_ should be noticed, and compared with"
2609,IX.,"the translations of Ettmüller, Grein, and Simrock, who have"
2610,IX.,respectively--
2611,IX.,
2612,IX.,_entband beadurunen_
2613,IX.,_entband Streitrunen_
2614,IX.,_Kampfrunen ... entbinden._
2615,IX.,
2616,IX.,Heyne is the only one who translates the phrase in such a way as to make
2617,IX.,the words intelligible to a reader unacquainted with Old English.
2618,IX.,"Finally, it should be noticed that the translation is quite as accurate"
2619,IX.,as those which preceded it. Heyne certainly succeeded in his attempt to
2620,IX.,make the poem more intelligible to the general reader than it had ever
2621,IX.,been before. While not so serviceable to the scholar as Grein's
2622,IX.,"translation, it is undoubtedly the most enjoyable of the German"
2623,IX.,versions.

2739,HUNFRID.,
2740,HUNFRID.,Von Wolzogen's translation is hardly trustworthy. A specimen of his free
2741,HUNFRID.,interpretation of the _Beowulf_ diction may be seen in the footnote on
2742,HUNFRID.,"page 13, where he defines _horng[-e]ap_ (i.e. 'with wide intervals"
2743,HUNFRID.,"between its pinnacles of horn') as 'hornreich,' and translates"
2744,HUNFRID.,"_hornreced_, 'Hornburg.' Inaccurate renderings of the Old English have"
2745,HUNFRID.,been noted above in italics. They reveal an especial difficulty with the
2746,HUNFRID.,"kenning, a device which von Wolzogen apparently did not understand,"
2747,HUNFRID.,since the entire translation shows an attempt to interpret the kenning
2748,HUNFRID.,"hypotactically. Had the translator been making a paraphrase,"
2749,HUNFRID.,inaccuracies like 'muthige Meerfahrt' and 'ihr rangt mit dem Wasser'
2750,HUNFRID.,might be excused; but in a translation which was avowedly literal (more
2751,HUNFRID.,literal than Heyne's) they appear to be due to nothing less than
2752,HUNFRID.,ignorance and carelessness. To give one example from the thousand that
2753,HUNFRID.,"bear out the truth of this statement, we may cite line 561 (p. 27),"

2762,HUNFRID.,
2763,HUNFRID.,This is not paraphrase; it is sheer misapprehension of the Old English.

2765,HUNFRID.,"A similar misapprehension is seen in line 15 of the extract,"

2772,HUNFRID.,
2773,HUNFRID.,The verse of von Wolzogen's translation is the poorest of the German
2774,HUNFRID.,attempts at imitative measures. The translator is obliged at times to
2775,HUNFRID.,"append footnotes explaining the scansion of his lines (see pp. 33, 34,"
2776,HUNFRID.,"65, 91). The cesura is frequently not in evidence (cf. lines 14 and 22,"
2777,HUNFRID.,both of which are also metrically incorrect); the lines are often

2833,ARNOLD'S EDITION,"basis of his edition. He speaks of a 'partial collation' of the MS., but"
2834,ARNOLD'S EDITION,this appears to have been nothing more than a transcription of certain
2835,ARNOLD'S EDITION,fragmentary parts of the MS. One of these passages is printed in the
2836,ARNOLD'S EDITION,"Introduction, where it is referred to as an 'exact transcript'; yet, in"
2837,ARNOLD'S EDITION,"collating it with the Zupitza _Autotypes_, I have found the following"
2838,ARNOLD'S EDITION,errors:--
2839,ARNOLD'S EDITION,
2840,ARNOLD'S EDITION,"Line 2219[6], þeowes _for_ þeofes."
2841,ARNOLD'S EDITION,"2220, biorn _for_ beorna."

2846,ARNOLD'S EDITION,
2847,ARNOLD'S EDITION,Of course the faded condition of the MS. offers some excuse for one or
2848,ARNOLD'S EDITION,"two of these errors, but, if we encounter mistakes in a short transcript"
2849,ARNOLD'S EDITION,"professedly exact, what would have been the fate of the text had the"
2850,ARNOLD'S EDITION,entire MS. been collated?
2851,ARNOLD'S EDITION,
2852,ARNOLD'S EDITION,Professor Garnett[7] has noted that Arnold's text was taken from
2853,ARNOLD'S EDITION,"Thorpe's, with some changes to suit the 1857 text of Grein. In order to"
2854,ARNOLD'S EDITION,test the accuracy of these statements I have made a collation of the
2855,ARNOLD'S EDITION,"texts of Arnold, Thorpe, and the MS. The list of errors in Thorpe's"
2856,ARNOLD'S EDITION,"text, which I have mentioned in a discussion of that work[8], is"
2857,ARNOLD'S EDITION,repeated bodily in Arnold's. Yet there was no excuse at this time for
2858,ARNOLD'S EDITION,the retention of many of these readings. Grundtvig[9] had corrected
2859,ARNOLD'S EDITION,several of them as early as 1861 by his collation of the Thorkelin
2860,ARNOLD'S EDITION,transcripts[10]; Heyne had got rid of them by collating Thorpe's work
2861,ARNOLD'S EDITION,with Kemble's[11] and Grundtvig's. Arnold makes almost no reference to
2862,ARNOLD'S EDITION,"the work of Heyne, and incorporates none of his emendations. He also"
2863,ARNOLD'S EDITION,"overlooked Grein's 1867 text, which contained new readings and a"
2864,ARNOLD'S EDITION,glossary. Arnold himself did not emend the text in a single instance.

2875,VIII.,man on the earth should ever appropriate more deeds of fame under
2876,VIII.,heaven than he himself. 'Art thou that Beowulf who strove against
2877,VIII.,Breca in a swimming-match on the broad sea? where ye two for
2878,VIII.,"emulation explored the waves, and for foolish boasting ventured"
2879,VIII.,"your lives in the deep water. Nor could any man, either friend or"
2880,VIII.,"foe, warn you off from your perilous adventure. Then ye two rowed"
2881,VIII.,"on the sea, where with your arms [outspread] ye covered the"
2882,VIII.,"ocean-stream, measured the sea-ways, churned up [the water] with"
2883,VIII.,"your hands, glided over the deep; the sea was tossing with waves,"
2884,VIII.,the icy wintry sea. Ye two toiled for seven nights in the watery
2885,VIII.,"realm; he overcame thee in the match, he had more strength. Then,"
2886,VIII.,"at dawn of morn, the sea cast him up on [the coast of] the"
2887,VIII.,"Heathoreamas; thence he, dear in the sight of his people, sought"
2888,VIII.,"his loved native soil, the land of the Brondings, the fair safe"
2889,VIII.,"burgh where he was the owner of folk, burgh, and precious jewels.'"

2940,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,"Other scholars, if they devoted themselves to English at all, studied"
2941,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,chiefly the later periods of the literature[2]. In 1867 the author of
2942,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,"the article on _Beowulf_ in Larousse's Dictionary could say, 'Le poème"
2943,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,n'est pas connu en France.' In 1876 Botkine published a historical and
2944,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,critical analysis of the poem[3]. This was the first scholarly attention
2945,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,that the poem received in France. In the following year Botkine's
2946,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,translation appeared.
2947,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,
2948,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,France has added nothing to our knowledge of _Beowulf_; there has never
2949,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,"been another translation, nor even a reprint of Botkine's. There has"
2950,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,been no further scholarly work done on the poem; and the principal
2951,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,"literary notices of it, such as Taine's and Jusserand's, have been"
2952,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,notoriously unsympathetic. The genius of Old English poetry is at the

2973,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,
2974,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,"The translation, which is in prose, is characterized, as the author"
2975,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,"himself admits, by extreme freedom and occasional omission of words and"
2976,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,phrases. The author's defence of these may be given here:--
2977,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,
2978,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,"'Je crois devoir me disculper, en présentant cette première"
2979,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,"traduction française de Beowulf, du double reproche qui pourrait"
2980,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,m'être adressé d'avoir supprimé des passages du poëme et de n'en
2981,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,avoir pas suffisamment respecté la lettre. D'abord je dois dire
2982,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,que les passages que j'ai supprimés (il y en a fort peu) sont ou
2983,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,"très obscurs ou d'une superfluité choquante. Ensuite, il m'a"
2984,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,semblé qu'en donnant une certaine liberté à ma traduction et en
2985,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,évitant autant que possible d'y mettre les redites et les
2986,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,"périphrases de l'original anglo-saxon, je la rendrais meilleure et"
2987,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,plus conforme à l'esprit véritable de l'oeuvre. Est-ce sacrifier du
2988,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,reste la fidélité d'une traduction que d'épargner au public la
2989,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,lecture de détails le plus souvent bizarres et inintelligibles?
2990,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,N'est-il pas plus logique d'en finir de suite avec des artifices
2991,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,"poétiques inconnus à nos littératures modernes, plutôt que de"
2992,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,vouloir s'escrimer en vain à les reproduire en français? Et alors
2993,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,"même qu'on poursuivrait jusqu'au bout une tâche si ingrate,"
2994,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,pourrait-on se flatter en fin de compte d'avoir conservé au poëme
2995,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,son cachet si indiscutable d'originalité? Non certes.'

2997,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,
2998,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,"'Il ne faut pas oublier que, la langue française différant"

3003,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,"It has been customary, in speaking of the work of M. Botkine, to call"

3006,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,"long digressions, but the metaphors, the parenthetical phrases, and"
3007,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,especially kennings and similar appositives.
3008,BOTKINE'S TRANSLATION,

3057,IX.,"If the translation is compared with the text, the reader will be struck"
3058,IX.,by the characteristic beauty of the words omitted. We may agree with the
3059,IX.,translator regarding the difficulty of rendering compound and kenning
3060,IX.,"into French, and yet the very absence of an attempt to do this"
3061,IX.,jeopardizes the value of the translation more than the omission of many
3062,IX.,"episodes, for it brings it dangerously near to paraphrase. 'Vous avez"
3063,IX.,"nagé alors sur la mer, vous avez suivi les sentiers de l'océan,' cannot"
3064,IX.,possibly be called a translation of--
3065,IX.,

3072,IX.,
3073,IX.,A part of the story has been thrown away with the adjectives. The force
3074,IX.,and beauty of the passage are gone.
3075,IX.,
3076,IX.,But there is another danger in this paraphrastic method. In omitting
3077,IX.,"words and phrases, the translator will often misinterpret his original."
3078,IX.,This is especially true of Botkine's work in the obscure episodes where
3079,IX.,he wishes to make the meaning perfectly clear. In attempting to simplify
3080,IX.,"the Old English, he departs from the original sense. Instances of this"
3081,IX.,may be brought forward from the Finn episode:
3082,IX.,
3083,IX.,Folcwaldan sunu
3084,IX.,"d[-o]gra gehwylce Dene weorþode,"
3085,IX.,"Hengestes h[-e]ap hringum wenede,"

3089,IX.,
3090,IX.,ll. 1089 ff.
3091,IX.,
3092,IX.,The idea is misinterpreted in Botkine's--
3093,IX.,
3094,IX.,Le fils de Folcwalda (stipulait qu'il) leur ferait chaque jour une
3095,IX.,distribution de trésors. (p. 50.)
3096,IX.,
3097,IX.,"Again, at line 1117 it is said of the lady--"
3098,IX.,
3099,IX.,"earme on eaxle    ides gnornode,"
3100,IX.,
3101,IX.,meaning that the lady stood by the body (shoulder) of the corpse as it
3102,IX.,lay on the pyre. Botkine makes of this--
3103,IX.,
3104,IX.,'Elle poussait des lamentations en s'appuyant sur le bras de son
3105,IX.,fils.' (p. 50.)
3106,IX.,
3107,IX.,"The rendering is not without its amusing features, chiefly illustrations"
3108,IX.,of the inability of the French language to accommodate itself to
3109,IX.,typically Germanic expressions. Thus when Hrothgar says what is the
3110,IX.,"equivalent of 'Thanks be to God for this blessed sight,' Botkine puts"
3111,IX.,into his mouth the words: 'Que le Tout-Puissant reçoive mes profonds
3112,IX.,remercîments pour ce spectacle!'--which might have been taken from a
3113,IX.,diplomatic note.

3239,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,The extract illustrates the paraphrastic nature of parts of the
3240,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,translation. Lumsden frequently seems to feel it necessary to read a
3241,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,meaning into the obscure lines and passages that do not easily lend
3242,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,"themselves to translation; cf. lines 11, 12. At line 2258 Lumsden"
3243,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,translates:--
3244,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,
3245,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,The mail that bite of sword
3246,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,O'er clashing shield in fight withstood must follow its dead lord.

3249,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,
3250,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,The Old English from which this passage is taken reads:--
3251,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,
3252,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,"ge swylce s[-e]o here-p[-a]d,  s[-i]o æt hilde geb[-a]d"

3256,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,hæleðum be healfe.
3257,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,
3258,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,"The passage is certainly obscure, and the readings are not all"
3259,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,"undoubted, but the words can never be tortured into meaning what Lumsden"
3260,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,tries to make them mean.
3261,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,
3262,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,But it would be manifestly unfair to judge a translation addressed to
3263,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,the general reader merely by scholarly tests. The work must make its
3264,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,appeal as a literary rendering.
3265,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,
3266,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,The propriety of adopting a ballad measure may be questioned. Probably
3267,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,"no measure could be found more unlike the Old English lines. Moreover,"
3268,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,"by reason of its long association with purely popular poetry, it"
3269,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,"constantly suggests the commonplace and the trivial. But above all, it"
3270,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,is reminiscent of a medievalism wholly different from that of _Beowulf_.
3271,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,
3272,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,The saving grace of the ballad measure is its readableness. It is rather
3273,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,"effective in passages not too dignified, calling for action. But in"
3274,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,passages of elevation the line is found wanting:--
3275,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,
3276,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,"They mourned their king and chanted dirge,"
3277,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,and much of him they said;
3278,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,"His worthiness they praised,"
3279,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,and judged his deeds with tender dread.
3280,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,
3281,IV. HUNFERD AND BEOWULF.,"But, like Wackerbarth's, Lumsden's translation had the advantage of"

3332,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,
3333,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,As has been pointed out above in the sections on Arnold[1] and
3334,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,"Lumsden[2], no satisfactory literal translation of _Beowulf_ existed in"
3335,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,"English. Furthermore, an American translation had never appeared. It was"
3336,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,with a view to presenting the latest German interpretations of the poem
3337,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,that Garnett prepared his literal version of the poem. The original
3338,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,"draft of the translation was made at St. John's College, Md., in the"
3339,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,session of 1878-79.--Preface to first edition.

3345,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,showing the variants from Heyne's text of 1879. In the second edition

3349,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,_Method of Translation._
3350,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,
3351,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,The translation is intended for 'the general reader' and for the 'aid of
3352,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,students of the poem.' --Preface to second edition.
3353,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,
3354,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,The translation is a literal line-for-line version. Of this feature of
3355,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,his work Professor Garnett says:--
3356,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,
3357,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,"'This involves naturally much inversion and occasional obscurity,"
3358,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,and lacks smoothness; but it seemed to me to give the general
3359,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,reader a better idea of the poem than a mere prose translation
3360,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,"would do, in addition to the advantage of literalness. While it"
3361,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,"would have been easy, by means of periphrasis and freer"
3362,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,"translation, to mend some of the defects chargeable to the"
3363,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,"line-for-line form, the translation would have lacked literalness,"
3364,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,which I regarded as the most important object.' --Preface to the
3365,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,first edition.
3366,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,
3367,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,
3368,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,_Nature of the Verse-form._
3369,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,
3370,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,"'In respect to the rhythmical form, I have endeavored to preserve"
3371,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,"two accents to each half-line, with cæsura, and while not seeking"
3372,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,"alliteration, have employed it purposely wherever it readily"
3373,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,presented itself. I considered that it mattered little whether the
3374,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,"feet were iambi or trochees, anapæsts or dactyls, the preservation"
3375,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,"of the two accents being the main point, and have freely made use"
3376,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,of all the usual licences in Early English verse.... To attain
3377,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,this point I have sometimes found it necessary to place unemphatic
3378,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,"words in accented positions, and words usually accented in"
3379,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,"unaccented ones, which licence can also be found in Early English"
3380,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,verse.... While the reader of modern English verse may sometimes
3381,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,"be offended by the ruggedness of the rhythm, it is hoped that the"
3382,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,Anglo-Saxon scholar will make allowances for the difficulty of
3383,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,"reproducing, even approximately, the rhythm of the original. The"
3384,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,reproduction of the sense as closely as possible had to be kept
3385,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,"constantly in view, even to the detriment of the smoothness of the"
3386,GARNETT'S TRANSLATION,rhythm.' --Preface to the first edition.

3423,III.,_Criticism of the Translation._
3424,III.,
3425,III.,"The translation, in its revised form, is throughout a faithful version"
3426,III.,of the original text. The fault of Garnett's translation is the fault of
3427,III.,all merely literal translations--inadequacy to render fully the content
3428,III.,"of the original. The rendering may be word for word, but it will not be"
3429,III.,idea for idea. Examples of this inadequacy may be given from the printed
3430,III.,extract. 'Grief' in line 502 is a very insufficient rendering of
3431,III.,"_æf-þunca_, a unique word which suggests at once vexation,"
3432,III.,"mortification, and jealousy. Had the poet simply meant to express the"
3433,III.,"notion of _grief_, he would have used _sorh_, _cearu_, or some other"
3434,III.,common word. In line 508 'pride' hardly gives full expression to the
3435,III.,"idea of _wlence,_ which signifies not only _pride_, but _vain pride, of"
3436,III.,empty end_. In line 517 'conquered' is insufficient as a translation of
3437,III.,"_oferfl[-a]t_, which means to _overcome in swimming, to outswim_."
3438,III.,
3439,III.,Examples of this sort can be brought forward from any part of the poem.
3440,III.,At line 2544 Garnett translates--
3441,III.,
3442,III.,"Struggles of battle when warriors contended,"
3443,III.,
3444,III.,a translation of--
3445,III.,
3446,III.,G[-u]ða ... þonne hnitan f[-e]ðan
3447,III.,
3448,III.,Here 'hnitan f[-e]ðan' refers to the swift clash in battle of two armed
3449,III.,"hosts, a notion which is ill borne out by the distributive 'warriors'"
3450,III.,and the vague 'contended.'
3451,III.,
3452,III.,At line 2598 we find--
3453,III.,
3454,III.,they to wood went
3455,III.,
3456,III.,for
3457,III.,
3458,III.,"h[-y] on holt bugon,"
3459,III.,
3460,III.,"which, whatever be the meaning of 'bugon,' is surely a misleading"
3461,III.,translation.
3462,III.,
3463,III.,The nature of the verse has been sufficiently illustrated by the
3464,III.,quotations from the author's preface. It would seem from the way in
3465,III.,"which the measure is used that it was a kind of second thought, incident"
3466,III.,upon the use of a line-for-line translation. It is hard to read the
3467,III.,"lines as anything but prose, and, if they appeared in any other form"
3468,III.,"upon the page, it is to be questioned whether any one would have guessed"
3469,III.,that they were intended to be imitative.
3470,III.,
3471,III.,
3472,III.,_Reception of Garnett's Translation._
3473,III.,
3474,III.,Garnett's volume had a flattering reception. The book received long and
3475,III.,respectful reviews from the Germans. Professor Child and Henry Sweet
3476,III.,expressed their approbation. The book has passed through four editions.
3477,III.,This cordial welcome has been due in large measure to the increasing
3478,III.,attention given the poem in American colleges and secondary schools.
3479,III.,"Being strictly literal, the book has been of value as a means of"
3480,III.,interpreting the poem.

3574,VIII.,_Criticism of the Translation._
3575,VIII.,
3576,VIII.,The present writer cannot attempt a literary criticism of the
3577,VIII.,translation.
3578,VIII.,
3579,VIII.,In purpose and method this version may be compared with that of
3580,VIII.,Kemble[1] and of Schaldemose[2]. In each case the translator was
3581,VIII.,"introducing the poem to a foreign public, and it was therefore well that"
3582,VIII.,the translation should be literal in order that it might assist in the
3583,VIII.,interpretation of the original. There has been no further work done on
3584,VIII.,the poem in Italy[3].
3585,VIII.,
3586,VIII.,While the verse is not strictly imitative in the sense that it preserves
3587,VIII.,"exactly the Old English system of versification, it aims to maintain the"
3588,VIII.,"general movement of the original lines. The four stresses are kept, save"
3589,VIII.,where a fifth is used to avoid monotony. These 'expanded lines' are much
3590,VIII.,commoner in the Italian than in the Old English.

3613,WICKBERG'S TRANSLATION,The translator begins his introduction with a discussion of the
3614,WICKBERG'S TRANSLATION,importance of _Beowulf_ as a historical document. For this reason he is
3615,WICKBERG'S TRANSLATION,especially interested in the episodes:--
3616,WICKBERG'S TRANSLATION,
3617,WICKBERG'S TRANSLATION,'This important historical interest may then explain the reason
3618,WICKBERG'S TRANSLATION,"for translating the poem into Swedish, and also serve as an excuse"
3619,WICKBERG'S TRANSLATION,for the fact that in the translation the poetic form has not been
3620,WICKBERG'S TRANSLATION,"considered of first importance.' --Inledning, p. 3."

3627,WICKBERG'S TRANSLATION,never to strive after archaic flavor in point of words and
3628,WICKBERG'S TRANSLATION,"expressions. Since the poet wrote in the language of his day, the"
3629,WICKBERG'S TRANSLATION,translation ought also to use contemporary language.... I have
3630,WICKBERG'S TRANSLATION,"tried to follow the original faithfully, but not slavishly. For"
3631,WICKBERG'S TRANSLATION,the sake of clearness the half-lines have often been
3632,WICKBERG'S TRANSLATION,transposed.... The rhythm is still more irregular than the Old

3693,EARLE'S TRANSLATION,Sixteen years had elapsed since the publication of a scholarly
3694,EARLE'S TRANSLATION,translation in England--for Lumsden's[1] can hardly be said to count as
3695,EARLE'S TRANSLATION,such. In the meantime Heyne's text[2] had passed into a fifth edition
3696,EARLE'S TRANSLATION,(1888); Wülker's revision of Grein's _Bibliothek_ had appeared with a
3697,EARLE'S TRANSLATION,new text of _Beowulf_ (1881); Zupitza's _Autotypes_ of the MS. had
3698,EARLE'S TRANSLATION,"appeared 1882, making it possible to ascertain exactly what was in the"
3699,EARLE'S TRANSLATION,"original text of the poem; the studies of Sievers[3], Cosijn[4],"
3700,EARLE'S TRANSLATION,"Kluge[5], and Bugge[6] had been published, containing masterly"
3701,EARLE'S TRANSLATION,discussions of text revision. Some of these materials had been used by

3706,EARLE'S TRANSLATION,
3707,EARLE'S TRANSLATION,Nothing is said in the introduction respecting the aim of the
3708,EARLE'S TRANSLATION,translation; but it is evident from the Notes that the purpose was
3709,EARLE'S TRANSLATION,"twofold--to present the latest interpretation of the text, and to afford"
3710,EARLE'S TRANSLATION,a literary version of the poem.

3726,EARLE'S TRANSLATION,
3727,EARLE'S TRANSLATION,The Introduction presents a new theory of the origin of the poem. The

3737,VIII.,_Unferth the king's orator is jealous. He baits the young
3738,VIII.,"adventurer, and in a scoffing speech dares him to a night-watch"
3739,VIII.,"for Grendel. Beowulf is angered, and thus he is drawn out to boast"
3740,VIII.,of his youthful feats._
3741,VIII.,
3742,VIII.,"Unferth made a speech, Ecglaf's son; he who sate at the feet of"
3743,VIII.,"the Scyldings' lord, broached a quarrelsome theme--the adventure"
3744,VIII.,"of Beowulf the high-souled voyager was great despite to him,"
3745,VIII.,because he grudged that any other man should ever in the world
3746,VIII.,achieve more exploits under heaven than he himself:-- 'Art thou
3747,VIII.,"_that_ Beowulf, he who strove with Breca on open sea in"
3748,VIII.,"swimming-match, where ye twain out of bravado explored the floods,"
3749,VIII.,and foolhardily in deep water jeoparded your lives? nor could any
3750,VIII.,"man, friend or foe, turn the pair of you from the dismal"
3751,VIII.,"adventure! What time ye twain plied in swimming, where ye twain"
3752,VIII.,"covered with your arms the awful stream, meted the sea-streets,"
3753,VIII.,"buffeted with hands, shot over ocean; the deep boiled with waves,"
3754,VIII.,a wintry surge. Ye twain in the realm of waters toiled a
3755,VIII.,"se'nnight; he at swimming outvied thee, had greater force. Then in"
3756,VIII.,"morning hour the swell cast him ashore on the Heathoram people,"
3757,VIII.,"whence he made for his own patrimony, dear to his Leeds he made"
3758,VIII.,"for the land of the Brondings, a fair stronghold, where he was"
3759,VIII.,"lord of folk, of city, and of rings. All his boast to thee-ward,"
3760,VIII.,Beanstan's son soothly fulfilled. Wherefore I anticipate for thee
3761,VIII.,"worse luck--though thou wert everywhere doughty in battle-shocks,"
3762,VIII.,in grim war-tug--if thou darest bide in Grendel's way a night-long
3763,VIII.,space.'
3764,VIII.,
3765,VIII.,
3766,VIII.,_Criticism of the Translation._
3767,VIII.,
3768,VIII.,"As a whole, the translation may fairly be called faithful. The"
3769,VIII.,emendations from which Professor Earle sometimes renders are always
3770,VIII.,"carefully chosen, and the discussions of obscure lines in the poem are"
3771,VIII.,of real scholarly interest. But this is not always true of the simpler
3772,VIII.,passages of the poem. These are often strained to make them square with
3773,VIII.,"the translator's personal notions. Thus, at line 1723, Earle reads for"
3774,VIII.,
3775,VIII.,_Ic þis gid be þ[-e] [-a]wraec_
3776,VIII.,"It is about thee ... that I have told this tale,"
3777,VIII.,
3778,VIII.,"adding in a note, '(In this passage) the living poet steps forward out"
3779,VIII.,"of his Hrothgar, and turns his eyes to the prince for whom he made it"
3780,VIII.,up' (p. 168). Now this is nothing more than an attempt on the part of
3781,VIII.,the translator to wring from the Old English lines some scrap of proof
3782,VIII.,for the peculiar theory that he holds of the origin of the poem.
3783,VIII.,
3784,VIII.,"Similarly, he often reads into a single word more than it can possibly"
3785,VIII.,bear. At line 371 he translates--
3786,VIII.,
3787,VIII.,"_Hrothgar, helm Scyldinga,_"
3788,VIII.,"Hrothgar, crown of Scyldings."
3789,VIII.,
3790,VIII.,"But 'crown' is an impossible rendering of 'helm,' which is here used"
3791,VIII.,"figuratively to denote the idea of protection[8], rather than the idea"
3792,VIII.,"of the crowning glory of kingship. Further, in the same passage, 375-6,"
3793,VIII.,"_heard eafora_ (bold son), is wrenched into meaning 'grown-up son.'"
3794,VIII.,These are but two examples of what is common throughout the translation.
3795,VIII.,
3796,VIII.,
3797,VIII.,_Diction._
3798,VIII.,
3799,VIII.,The archaic style used by Professor Earle cannot be regarded as highly
3800,VIII.,"felicitous, since it mixes the diction of various ages. Here are Old"
3801,VIII.,English archaisms like 'Leeds' and 'burnie'; here are expressions like
3802,VIII.,"'escheat,' 'page' (attendant), 'emprize,' 'bombard' (drinking-vessel),"
3803,VIII.,"'chivalry.' Here are such specialized words as 'harpoon,' 'belligerent,'"
3804,VIII.,"'pocket-money,' and combinations like 'battailous grip'; while"
3805,VIII.,throughout the entire translation are scattered modern colloquialisms
3806,VIII.,"like 'boss' (master), 'tussle,' 'war-tug.'"
3807,VIII.,
3808,VIII.,The reason for these anomalies is evident--the translator wishes to
3809,VIII.,imitate the remoteness of the original style. The style is certainly
3810,VIII.,remote--at times almost as remote from the language of to-day as is the
3811,VIII.,style of _Beowulf_ itself.

3954,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,
3955,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,"The translation is faithful, but not literal. The chief difference, for"
3956,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,"example, between this and the translation by Garnett is that Hall makes"
3957,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,an attempt to preserve the poetic value of the Old English words. He is
3958,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,never satisfied with the dictionary equivalent of an Old English
3959,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,"expression. Thus, in the extract given above, 'from vainest vaunting' is"
3960,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,given as a translation of _dol-gilpe_--a great improvement over
3961,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,"Garnett's rendering, 'for pride.' Similarly, 'mixing and stirring' is"
3962,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,given as a translation of _mundum brugdon_. This method often leads the
3963,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,"translator some distance, perhaps too great a distance, from the Old"
3964,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,English. The following may serve as examples of the heightened color
3965,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,that Hall gives to the Old English forms:--
3966,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,
3967,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,"548, 'the north-wind whistled, fierce in our faces,'"
3968,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,for _norþan-wind heaðo-grim ondhwearf_.
3969,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,
3970,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,"557, 'my obedient blade,' for _hilde-bille_."
3971,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,
3972,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,"568, 'foam-dashing currents,' for _brontne ford_."
3973,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,
3974,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,"587, 'with cold-hearted cruelty thou killedst thy brothers,'"
3975,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,for _ð[-u] þ[-i]num br[-o]ðrum t[-o] banan wurde_.
3976,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,
3977,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,"606, 'the sun in its ether robes,' for _sunne swegl-wered_."
3978,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,
3979,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,"838, 'in the mist of the morning,' for _on morgen_."
3980,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,
3981,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,"1311, 'As day was dawning in the dusk of the morning,'"
3982,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,for _[-æ]r-dæge_.
3983,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,
3984,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,Perhaps these paraphrastic renderings are what Dr. Hall is referring to
3985,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,"when he says in his preface, regarding the nature of the translation,"
3986,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,"'Occasionally some loss has been sustained; but, on the other hand,"
3987,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,a gain has here and there been made.'
3988,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,
3989,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,"As for the archaism, that is well enough for those who like it. It is"
3990,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,"never so strange as that of Earle, or the marvelous diction of William"
3991,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,"Morris. But it is not, therefore, dignified or clear. How much dignity"
3992,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,and clarity a translator has a right to introduce into his rendering is
3993,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,"a matter of opinion. Mr. Hall was quite conscious of what he was doing,"
3994,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,and doubtless regarded his diction as well suited to convey the original
3995,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,Beowulf spirit.
3996,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,
3997,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,The chief criticism of the verse is that it is often not verse at all.
3998,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,Many passages are indistinguishable from prose. This is a stricture that
3999,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,"cannot be passed on the Old English, nor on the best modern imitations"
4000,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,of it.
4001,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,

4012,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,"Emotions that moved him. --Page 64, line 59."
4013,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,
4014,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,"There might be an excuse for some of this freedom in blank verse, but in"
4015,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,measures imitative of the Old English it is utterly out of place. There
4016,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,is always a pause at the end of a line in Old English; run-on lines are
4017,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,uncommon. There is not an example in _Beowulf_ of an ending so light as
4018,UNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.,'the' or 'a' in the verses quoted above.

4042,HOFFMANN'S TRANSLATION,
4043,HOFFMANN'S TRANSLATION,The translator desired to present a rendering of the poem that should
4044,HOFFMANN'S TRANSLATION,attract the general reader. He regarded Simrock's version as too literal
4045,HOFFMANN'S TRANSLATION,"and archaic[1], the version of von Wolzogen as not sufficiently clear"
4046,HOFFMANN'S TRANSLATION,"and beautiful[2], and the version of Heyne as not sufficiently varied in"
4047,HOFFMANN'S TRANSLATION,"form[3] (Vorwort, i). He regards the _Beowulf_ as of great importance in"
4048,HOFFMANN'S TRANSLATION,inspiring patriotism--he always calls the poem German--and even offers a
4049,HOFFMANN'S TRANSLATION,comparison of _Beowulf_ with Emperor William I. With the scholarship of
4050,HOFFMANN'S TRANSLATION,his subject the author hardly seems concerned.

4112,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,_Criticism of the Translation._
4113,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,
4114,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,Hoffmann's translation is certainly not a contribution to scholarship.
4115,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,It is a sufficient condemnation of the volume to quote the words of the
4116,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,Vorwort:--
4117,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,
4118,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,"'Die Uebersetzungen von Grein, Holder und Möller sind mir nicht"
4119,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,"zugänglich gewesen, auch wie es scheint, nicht sehr bekannt.'"
4120,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,
4121,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,It is not surprising that Hoffmann is unacquainted with the translations
4122,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,"of Holder and Möller, as these works have never been made; but that a"
4123,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,German translator should ignore the version of Grein is a revelation
4124,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,indeed.
4125,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,
4126,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,Even though a translator may not care to embody in his work any new
4127,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,"interpretations, it is nevertheless his duty to base his translation on"
4128,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,the best text that he can find. But apparently Hoffmann had never heard
4129,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,"of the Heyne editions of the text, nor of the Grein-Wülker _Bibliothek_."
4130,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,He bases his translation on Grein's text of 1867. He evidently
4131,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,considered it a sufficient recommendation of his work to associate with
4132,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,"it the name of Grein, not troubling himself to discover what advance had"
4133,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,been made upon the work of that scholar.
4134,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,
4135,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,Examples of antiquated renderings may be brought forward:--
4136,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,
4137,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,"P. 1, line 1, Wie grosse Ruhmesthaten."
4138,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,"2, line 1, So soll mit Gaben werben im Vaterhause schon."
4139,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,"21, line 15 (see Extract), Vom Wintersturm getrieben Hoch"

4141,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,"84, line 3, Mothrytho."
4142,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,
4143,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,Petty inaccuracies due to the nature of the translation also appear. An
4144,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,"example of this is seen on page 3, at the opening of the first canto--"
4145,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,
4146,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,Ueber Burg und Mannen nun herrschte manches Jahr
4147,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,Beówulf der Schilding. Wie hold dem König war

4150,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,
4151,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,
4152,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,_Literary Criticism._
4153,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,
4154,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,The translation resembles the work of Lumsden[5] and Wackerbarth[6] in
4155,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,affording a version of the tale easily readable. And the same criticism
4156,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,may be passed on the work of Hoffmann that was passed on the two
4157,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,Englishmen. The style and medium chosen are not well fitted to render
4158,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,the spirit of the poem. The _Nibelungenlied_ is a poem of the late
4159,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,twelfth century. The _Beowulf_ at latest belongs to the eighth. To
4160,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,"choose for the translation of _Beowulf_, therefore, a medium surcharged"
4161,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,"with reminiscence of a time, place, and style quite different from those"
4162,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,of the original is certainly an error. It may find an audience where
4163,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,another and more faithful rendering would fail; but it will never win
4164,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,the esteem of scholars. In his introduction Hoffmann calls attention to
4165,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,"the lack of variety in blank verse, but surely it does not have the"
4166,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,monotony inherent in a recurring rime and strophe.
4167,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,
4168,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,"Again, rime and strophe force upon the author the use of words and"
4169,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,phrases needed to pad out the verse or stanza. Attention must also be
4170,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,called to the fact that the original seldom affords a natural pause at
4171,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,the exact point demanded by the use of a strophic form. See the close of
4172,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,"the following stanzas in the Extract: I, III, IV, V. One effect of the"
4173,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,"forced pause is that there is confusion in the use of kennings, which"
4174,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,often have to do duty as subject in one stanza and as object in another
4175,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,stanza.
4176,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,
4177,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,"Commonplace expressions, incident perhaps upon the use of the measure,"
4178,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,are not unfrequent. Thus

4188,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,
4189,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,"In conclusion, it may be said that Hoffmann's version marks an advance"
4190,VON BEOWULF'S SCHWIMMFAHRT.,"in one way only, readableness; and in this it is hardly superior to"

4239,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,
4240,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,The matter is fortunately made perfectly clear in Mackail's _Life of
4241,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,"William Morris_, vol. ii. p. 284:--"
4242,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,
4243,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,"'(Morris) was not an Anglo-Saxon scholar, and to help him in"
4244,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,"following the original, he used the aid of a prose translation"
4245,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,"made for him by Mr. A. J. Wyatt, of Christ's College, Cambridge,"
4246,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,with whom he had also read through the original. The plan of their
4247,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,joint labours had been settled in the autumn of 1892. Mr. Wyatt
4248,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,"began to supply Morris with his prose paraphrase in February,"
4249,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,"1893, and he at once began to ""rhyme up,"" as he said, ""very eager"
4250,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,"to be at it, finding it the most delightful work."" He was working"
4251,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,"at it all through the year, and used to read it to Burne-Jones"
4252,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,regularly on Sunday mornings in summer.'
4253,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,
4254,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,The plan of joining with his own the name of his principal teacher was
4255,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,one which Morris had used before when translating from a foreign tongue.
4256,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,He published his rendering of the _Volsunga Saga_ as the work of 'Eirikr
4257,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,Magnússon and William Morris.' There is no evidence that Mr. Wyatt had
4258,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,"any hand in forming the final draft of the translation. In defending it,"
4259,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,"Morris took all the responsibility for the book upon himself, and he"
4260,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,always spoke of it as his own work. In writing to a German student
4261,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,toward the end of his life Morris spoke of the translation as his own
4262,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,without mentioning Mr. Wyatt[1]. Nor has Mr. Wyatt shown a disposition
4263,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,to claim a share in the work. In the preface to his edition of the text
4264,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,"of _Beowulf_ (Cambridge, 1894), he says:--"
4265,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,
4266,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,'Mr. William Morris has taken the text of this edition as the
4267,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,basis of his modern metrical rendering of the lay.' --Page xiii.
4268,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,
4269,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,"Finally, it may be added that the specimens of Mr. Wyatt's translation"
4270,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,printed in the glossary and notes of his book bear no resemblance to the
4271,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,work of Morris.
4272,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,
4273,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,
4274,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,_Morris's Theory of Translation._
4275,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,
4276,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,None despised the merely literal rendering of an epic poem more than
4277,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,"William Morris. In writing of his version of the _Odyssey_ to Ellis,"
4278,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,"Morris said: 'My translation is a real one so far, not a mere periphrase"
4279,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,of the original as _all_ the others are.' In translating an ancient
4280,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,"poem, he tried to reproduce the simplicity and remoteness of phrase"
4281,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,"which he found in his original. He believed it possible, e.g., to"
4282,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,suggest the archaic flavor of Homer by adopting a diction that bore the
4283,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,same relation to modern English that the language of Homer bore to that
4284,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,of the age of Pericles. The archaism of the English would represent the
4285,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,archaism of the Greek. This method he used in rendering Vergil and
4286,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,Homer.
4287,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,
4288,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,"But when he approached the translation of _Beowulf_, he was confronted"
4289,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,by a new problem. It was evident that fifteenth-century English was
4290,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,ill-adapted to convey any just notion of eighth-century English.
4291,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,_Beowulf_ required a diction older than that of Sir Thomas Malory or
4292,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,"Chaucer. Hence it became necessary to discard the theory altogether,"
4293,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,or else to produce another style which should in some true sense be
4294,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,imitative of _Beowulf_. This latter Morris tried to accomplish by
4295,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,increasing the archaism of his style by every means in his power. This
4296,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,feature is discussed in the following section.
4297,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,
4298,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,
4299,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,_Nature of the Translation._
4300,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,
4301,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,The translation of _Beowulf_ is written in extremely archaic language.
4302,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,An imitative measure of four principal stresses is used. Wherever
4303,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,"possible, the Old English syntax has been preserved (see line 1242); the"
4304,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,word-order of the original is retained. The archaic language is wrought
4305,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,"of several different kinds of words. In the first place, there is the"
4306,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,"'legitimate archaism,' such as 'mickle,' 'burg,' 'bairn'; there are"
4307,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,forms which are more closely associated with the translation of Old
4308,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,"English, such as 'middle-garth,' 'ring-stem.' There are modern words"
4309,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,"used with the old signification, such as 'kindly' (in the sense 'of the"
4310,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,"same kind'), 'won war' (in the sense 'wage war'), 'fret' (in the sense"
4311,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,"'eat'). Finally, there are forms which are literally translated from"
4312,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,"Old English: 'the sight seen once only' from _ans[-y]n_, face, 251;"
4313,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,"'spearman' from _garsecg_, ocean (see extract), 'gift-scat' from"
4314,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,"_gif-sceatt_, gift of money, 378; 'the Maker's own making' from"
4315,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,"_metod-sceaft_, doom, 1180. Romance words are excluded whenever"
4316,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,possible. A glossary of 'some words not commonly used now' is included
4317,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,"in the book, but none of the words cited above, save 'burg,' is found"
4318,MORRIS AND WYATT'S TRANSLATION,in it.

4355,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,"The Morris-Wyatt translation is thoroughly accurate, and is, so to"
4356,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,"speak, an official commentary on the text of Wyatt's edition. It is"
4357,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,therefore of importance to the student of the _Beowulf_.
4358,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,
4359,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,As a literary rendering the translation is disappointing. In the first
4360,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,"place, it must be frankly avowed that the diction is frequently so"
4361,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,strange that it seems to modern readers well-nigh ridiculous. There are
4362,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,certain sentences which cannot but evoke a smile. Such are: '(he) spoke
4363,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,"a word backward,' line 315; 'them that in Scaney dealt out the scat,'"
4364,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,line 1686.
4365,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,
4366,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,"Secondly, the translation is unreadable. There is an avalanche of"
4367,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,archaisms. One example of the extreme obscurity may be given:--
4368,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,
4369,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,"'Then rathe was beroom'd, as the rich one was bidding,"
4370,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,For the guests a-foot going the floor all withinward.'

4372,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,
4373,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,"It would seem that the burden of 'rathe,' 'beroomed,' and 'withinward,'"
4374,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,"were sufficient for any sentence to carry, but we are left to discover"
4375,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,"for ourselves that 'rich one' does not mean rich one, but ruler, that"
4376,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,"the 'floor' is not a floor but a hall, and that the guests are not"
4377,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,"guests, but the ruler's own men."
4378,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,
4379,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,Morris himself was conscious of the obscurity of the work:--
4380,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,
4381,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,'For the language of his version Morris once felt it necessary to
4382,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,"make an apology. Except a few words, he said, the words used in it"
4383,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,were such as he would not hesitate to use in an original poem of
4384,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,"his own. He did not add, however, that their effect, if slipped"
4385,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,sparingly in amid his own pellucid construction and facile
4386,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,"narrative method, would be very different from their habitual use"
4387,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,"in a translation.... As the work advanced, he seems to have felt"
4388,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,"this himself, and his pleasure in the doing of it fell off.'"
4389,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,"--Mackail's _Life_, ii. 284-5."
4390,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,
4391,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,"Finally, the version does not _translate_. Words like 'Spearman' for"

4396,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,occasionally as obscure as the poem itself.

4398,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,"If one can peer through the darkness of Morris's diction, he will"
4399,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,discover a fairly pleasing use of the so-called imitative measure. The
4400,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,verse is not nearly so rough as the original; many of the characteristic
4401,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,substitutions are avoided. There is evident a tendency toward the
4402,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,'rising verse' and the anapestic foot. The feminine ending is frequently
4403,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,"used. The verse is, therefore, not strictly imitative in that it retains"
4404,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,"the Old English system of versification, but rather in that it attempts"
4405,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,to suggest the Old English movement by the use of four principal
4406,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,stresses and a varying number of unstressed syllables. Morris's verse is
4407,IX. UNFERTH CONTENDETH IN WORDS WITH BEOWULF.,the best of all the 'imitative' measures.

4508,IX.,"The translation seems to aim chiefly at accuracy, which accounts for the"
4509,IX.,rather large number of notes containing readings suggested by various
4510,IX.,commentators. The translator uses freely compounds and metaphors similar
4511,IX.,to those in the original text. This seems occasionally to militate
4512,IX.,"against the clearness of the work. Thus, it is doubtful whether"
4513,IX.,'kampgeheim ontkeetnend' of the extract conveys to the modern Dutch
4514,IX.,reader any notion similar to that of the Old English _beadu-runen
4515,IX.,onband_.
4516,IX.,
4517,IX.,The present writer is unable to offer any literary criticism of the

4586,IX.,
4587,IX.,_Criticism of the Translation._
4588,IX.,
4589,IX.,It would be manifestly unfair to criticize this translation for its want
4590,IX.,"of grace and melody, because it is avowedly a literal rendering, and a"
4591,IX.,literal rendering makes no attempt to attain these qualities. But there
4592,IX.,are certain things which are indispensable in a good literal
4593,IX.,translation. It is imperative that such a translation should be based on
4594,IX.,the best text of the original poem. What has Steineck done? He has gone
4595,IX.,back thirty-five years and chosen an early and inaccurate edition of a
4596,IX.,"work that has been five times re-edited, Heyne's text of 1863! It seems"
4597,IX.,"almost incredible that a German, living in the midst of scholars who"
4598,IX.,"have done more than any other people to interpret the _Beowulf_, should"
4599,IX.,ignore the fruits of their efforts.
4600,IX.,
4601,IX.,It is unnecessary to enumerate the faults of this translation due to
4602,IX.,dependence upon an antiquated edition of the text. Suffice it to say
4603,IX.,that when the edition of 1863 was printed the text had not yet been
4604,IX.,properly transcribed from the MS.[2]
4605,IX.,
4606,IX.,But there are evidences of an inaccuracy of a different kind that betray
4607,IX.,a carelessness utterly reprehensible. The author is apparently unable to
4608,IX.,transliterate properly the Old English names. Thus he has Vealhpeon and
4609,IX.,"Vealhpeo (for Wealhtheow), Ecgpeow, Halbdaene (for Healfdene),"
4610,IX.,"Ermanarich, &c."
4611,IX.,
4612,IX.,"In his attempt to produce an etymological document, the translator"
4613,IX.,uses many compounds such as even the German language might be better
4614,IX.,"without; such are--Sippenschar (sibbegedriht), 730; Schattenwandler"
4615,IX.,"(sceadugenga), 704; Wangenpolster (hl[-e]or-bolster), 689; Leibpanzer"
4616,IX.,"(l[-i]c-syrce), 550. As compounds these may not be offensive to a"
4617,IX.,German; but the trouble with them is that they do not translate the
4618,IX.,Old English ideas.
4619,IX.,
4620,IX.,"Finally, it may be asked why a translation that appeals only as a"
4621,IX.,"literal rendering should not be strictly literal, noting its every"
4622,IX.,"variation from the original, italicizing supplied words, holding to the"
4623,IX.,original word-order.
4624,IX.,
4625,IX.,Steineck's translation did not advance the interpretation of _Beowulf_
4626,IX.,a whit. In point of accuracy the book is not worthy to stand with good
4627,IX.,translations thirty years old.

4672,J. R. C. HALL'S TRANSLATION,out. The studies of the poem in the Introduction are sufficient for a

4817,TINKER'S TRANSLATION,
4818,TINKER'S TRANSLATION,'The present translation of _Beowulf_ is an attempt to make as
4819,TINKER'S TRANSLATION,simple and readable a version of the poem as is consistent with
4820,TINKER'S TRANSLATION,"the character of the original. Archaic forms, which have been much"
4821,TINKER'S TRANSLATION,"in favor with translators of Old English, have been excluded,"
4822,TINKER'S TRANSLATION,because it has been thought that vigor and variety are not
4823,TINKER'S TRANSLATION,"incompatible with simple, idiomatic English...."
4824,TINKER'S TRANSLATION,
4825,TINKER'S TRANSLATION,The principal ways in which the present version differs from a
4826,TINKER'S TRANSLATION,merely literal translation are the following: (1) in a rather
4827,TINKER'S TRANSLATION,broad interpretation of pregnant words and phrases; (2) in a
4828,TINKER'S TRANSLATION,conception of some of the Old English compounds as conventional
4829,TINKER'S TRANSLATION,phrases in which the original metaphorical sense is dead; (3) in a
4830,TINKER'S TRANSLATION,free treatment of connecting words; (4) in frequent substitution
4831,TINKER'S TRANSLATION,of a proper name for an ambiguous pronoun.
4832,TINKER'S TRANSLATION,
4833,TINKER'S TRANSLATION,"The translation is based on the text of A. J. Wyatt (Cambridge,"
4834,TINKER'S TRANSLATION,1898); a few departures from his readings are enumerated in the

4896,LEO'S DIGEST,This was the first German book to give any extended account of the poem.
4897,LEO'S DIGEST,
4898,LEO'S DIGEST,The titles of the chapters are: I. Historische Anlehnung; II. Mythischer
4899,LEO'S DIGEST,Inhalt; III. Die geographischen Angaben; IV. Genealogische Verhältnisse
4900,LEO'S DIGEST,der in dem Liede vorkommenden Helden; V. Uebersicht des Inhalts des
4901,LEO'S DIGEST,Gedichtes von Bëówulf. In this fifth chapter are found the extracts from
4902,LEO'S DIGEST,_Beowulf_. It will be seen that the chapter is somewhat subordinate to
4903,LEO'S DIGEST,"the others, its chief purpose being to furnish a kind of digest of the"
4904,LEO'S DIGEST,"poem, to be used principally as a work of reference. A desire to"
4905,LEO'S DIGEST,condense leads the translator to omit lines that he does not deem
4906,LEO'S DIGEST,essential to an understanding of the events and characters of the poem.
4907,LEO'S DIGEST,Unfortunately his omissions are often the most poetical lines of the
4908,LEO'S DIGEST,"_Beowulf_. For example, he omits the description of Beowulf's"
4909,LEO'S DIGEST,sea-voyage; Hrothgar's account of the haunt of Grendel and his dam is
4910,LEO'S DIGEST,"curtailed; the dying words of Beowulf, perhaps the most beautiful lines"
4911,LEO'S DIGEST,"in the poem, are clipped. Further examples may be found in the extract"
4912,LEO'S DIGEST,given below. This insufficiency is excused by the fact that Leo's main
4913,LEO'S DIGEST,object in preparing the book was to prove certain theories that he held

5001,E. H. JONES'S PARAPHRASE,real vigour without the repulsive characteristics impressed on
5002,E. H. JONES'S PARAPHRASE,"them by a comparatively rude and ignorant age may not, perhaps, be"
5003,E. H. JONES'S PARAPHRASE,regarded as inexcusably presumptuous. With greater confidence it
5004,E. H. JONES'S PARAPHRASE,"may be affirmed that, if we turn to these old legends or romances"
5005,E. H. JONES'S PARAPHRASE,"at all, it should be for the purpose of learning what they really"
5006,E. H. JONES'S PARAPHRASE,"were, and not with any wish of seeing them through a glass which"

5059,EXTRACT[1].,
5060,EXTRACT[1].,The object of a paraphrase is to present all the essential matter of the

5063,EXTRACT[1].,
5064,EXTRACT[1].,The matter of Mr. Jones's paraphrase is not above criticism. It is full
5065,EXTRACT[1].,"of minor errors. In the extract, for example, the original does not say"
5066,EXTRACT[1].,"that the heroes 'donned their war-weeds,' nor that there were mountains"
5067,EXTRACT[1].,on the shores of Denmark.
5068,EXTRACT[1].,
5069,EXTRACT[1].,"The style of the work is much better. It is throughout strong and clear,"
5070,EXTRACT[1].,"not over-sentimental. It is, perhaps, too intimate; it savors slightly"
5071,EXTRACT[1].,of the _Märchen_. This absence of vigor and remoteness may be due to the

5149,EXTRACT.,
5150,EXTRACT.,The translation is very free. Lines that are obscure in the original are
5151,EXTRACT.,"not allowed to be obscure in the translation, even if they have to have"
5152,EXTRACT.,"a meaning read into them. For example, in the extract quoted above,"
5153,EXTRACT.,"_beadu-runen onband_ of the original is rendered 'sucht' er Händel,'"
5154,EXTRACT.,"thoroughly intelligible, but not accurate. There is at times a tendency"
5155,EXTRACT.,"to paraphrase, or even to introduce an original sentence into the poem."
5156,EXTRACT.,An example of this may be seen at the close of the first canto:--
5157,EXTRACT.,
5158,EXTRACT.,'unerforschlich sind
5159,EXTRACT.,"Und dunkel oft die Wege des Geschickes[2].' --Page 5, l. 54."
5160,EXTRACT.,
5161,EXTRACT.,Words are occasionally omitted. In the extract above _ne l[-e]of n[-e]
5162,EXTRACT.,l[-a]ð_ (l. 511) and _sunu B[-e]anst[-a]nes_ (l. 524) are omitted in
5163,EXTRACT.,translation. There are no lines in the original which correspond to the
5164,EXTRACT.,last line and a half of the extract.
5165,EXTRACT.,
5166,EXTRACT.,Of course by adopting this method of translation the writer attains his
5167,EXTRACT.,"purpose. His poem is readable, but readable at the expense of accuracy."
5168,EXTRACT.,"As a paraphrase, the version is commendable; but it is hardly of"
5169,EXTRACT.,importance in any other way.

5244,EXTRACT.,"sentences. But, on the other hand, Mr. Gibb's work, unlike Mr. Jones's,"
5245,EXTRACT.,has no merits of style--it is all on a dead level of prose. Thus it sins
5246,EXTRACT.,"against one of the laws of paraphrase: that the writer, in relieving"
5247,EXTRACT.,"himself of the exacting duties of translator, must present the story in"
5248,EXTRACT.,a more literary and more truly adequate medium. Mr. Gibb's is one of the

5300,THE WÄGNER-MACDOWALL PARAPHRASE,The story does not pretend to do more than follow the most general
5301,THE WÄGNER-MACDOWALL PARAPHRASE,outlines of the original. The most important changes are in the first
5302,THE WÄGNER-MACDOWALL PARAPHRASE,"division of the poem, where it would seem that no changes whatever were"
5303,THE WÄGNER-MACDOWALL PARAPHRASE,needed. The principal additions are the following:--
5304,THE WÄGNER-MACDOWALL PARAPHRASE,
5305,THE WÄGNER-MACDOWALL PARAPHRASE,"(1) A minstrel flees from plague-stricken Heorot, sails to the Geatish"

5308,THE WÄGNER-MACDOWALL PARAPHRASE,
5309,THE WÄGNER-MACDOWALL PARAPHRASE,"(2) The swimming-match is introduced into the action of the story, with"
5310,THE WÄGNER-MACDOWALL PARAPHRASE,the _motif_ radically altered. Breca is represented as winning the
5311,THE WÄGNER-MACDOWALL PARAPHRASE,match.

5313,THE WÄGNER-MACDOWALL PARAPHRASE,(3) The incident of Beowulf's refusal of the crown is amplified and
5314,THE WÄGNER-MACDOWALL PARAPHRASE,introduced into the story at the opening of the third part.
5315,THE WÄGNER-MACDOWALL PARAPHRASE,

5321,EXTRACT.,"The minstrel tuned his harp and sang of Beowulf's heroic deeds,"
5322,EXTRACT.,and prophesied that he would conquer and slay the monster of the
5323,EXTRACT.,"morass. This praise made Hunford, one of the courtiers, angry and"
5324,EXTRACT.,"jealous. He said it was Breka, not Beowulf, that had won the"
5325,EXTRACT.,golden chain[2]; that the Gothic hero was undertaking an
5326,EXTRACT.,enterprise that would very likely lead him to his death; and he
5327,EXTRACT.,"advised him to think twice before attacking Grendel. Upon this,"
5328,EXTRACT.,Beowulf exclaimed indignantly that he had won a good sword instead
5329,EXTRACT.,"of the golden chain, and that it was sharp enough both to pierce"
5330,EXTRACT.,the hide of the monster and to cut out a slanderous tongue.

5334,EXTRACT.,
5335,EXTRACT.,The extract gives a good idea of the author's sins of omission and
5336,EXTRACT.,"commission. It will be seen, for example, that the tone of the entire"
5337,EXTRACT.,passage is altered. The bit of repartee in the last sentence is wholly
5338,EXTRACT.,"foreign to the Beowulf manner, which is outright and downright--the very"
5339,EXTRACT.,opposite of subtilty. The false manner is evident at once when we
5340,EXTRACT.,"compare the reply of the hero in the original, 'Thou art the murderer of"
5341,EXTRACT.,"thine own brethren, and thou shalt be damned in Hell. Wait till"
5342,EXTRACT.,"to-night, and thou shalt see which of us is the stronger.'"
5343,EXTRACT.,
5344,EXTRACT.,"The story is, if possible, more garbled than the style. The mission of"
5345,EXTRACT.,the minstrel and the mangled account of the swimming-match have no
5346,EXTRACT.,essential or artistic relation to the context. They are merely inserted
5347,EXTRACT.,to add to the action of the piece.
5348,EXTRACT.,
5349,EXTRACT.,The popularity of the book is attested by the number of editions through
5350,EXTRACT.,which it has passed. The volume contains also paraphrases of the legends
5351,EXTRACT.,"about Arthur, Charlemagne, and Tannhäuser, as well as the story of the"
5352,EXTRACT.,Nibelungs. These must account for its enduring success; but it is
5353,EXTRACT.,"unfortunate that this, the poorest of the Beowulf paraphrases, should"
5354,EXTRACT.,thus have found an audience which it did not deserve and could never
5355,EXTRACT.,have commanded for itself.

5484,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,
5485,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,This volume is included here because of the great influence it has had
5486,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,in forming popular notions regarding the _Beowulf_. The eminence of Mr.
5487,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,Brooke as a critic and as a poet has given him the attention of an
5488,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,audience hardly commanded by any other writer included in this paper.
5489,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,
5490,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,"Again, the number of lines actually translated by Mr. Brooke is equal to"

5495,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,
5496,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,The account in the second volume is much shorter than that in the first;
5497,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,"only twelve pages are given to the story of Beowulf, while the first"
5498,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,volume gives forty-three. The later book omits all discussion of the
5499,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,"episodes, and, although parts of the older volume are retained, the"
5500,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,"matter is, in general, re-written."

5506,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,
5507,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,"In his Preface (p. ix), the author speaks of the futility of prose"
5508,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,"translations of poetry, and of the inadequacy of modern English media"
5509,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,for translating the spirit of the poetry. Finally he adopts a line which
5510,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,he hopes will 'fulfil the needs and follow closely the peculiarities' of
5511,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,Old English.
5512,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,
5513,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,"'I chose after many experiments, the trochaic movement used in"
5514,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,"this book, each half-line consisting of trochees following one"
5515,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,"another, with a syllable at the end, chiefly a long one, to mark"
5516,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,"the division of the line. I varied the line as much as I could,"
5517,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,"introducing, often rashly, metrical changes; for the fault of this"
5518,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,movement is its monotony. I have sometimes tried an iambic
5519,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,"movement, but rarely; for this trochaic line with a beat at the"
5520,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,end of each half-verse seemed to me to get the nearest to the
5521,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,"sound of the Anglo-Saxon line, even though it is frequently"
5522,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,un-similar to that line itself. I used alliteration whenever I
5523,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,"could, and stressed as much as possible the alliterated words, and"
5524,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,I changed the length of the line with the changes of the original.
5525,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,But when I could not easily alliterate my line or stress the
5526,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,"alliterated word, I did not try to do so.'"
5527,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,
5528,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,The author adopts an archaic diction. The word-order of the Old English
5529,STOPFORD BROOKE'S SELECTIONS,is followed whenever possible.

5560,EXTRACT[1].,"While the extracts cannot always be praised for their accuracy, they"

5564,EXTRACT[1].,"Beowulf selections, however, are rare."
5565,EXTRACT[1].,
5566,EXTRACT[1].,The style of the extracts seems needlessly obscure. This is due in part
5567,EXTRACT[1].,to following too closely the original word-order (see lines 4 and 5 of
5568,EXTRACT[1].,"the extract), and in part to the free use of archaic language. Mr."
5569,EXTRACT[1].,"Brooke does not hesitate to employ such forms as, 'house-carles,'"

5652,EXTRACT.,Yet there was one eye that gleamed not with merriment and
5653,EXTRACT.,"goodwill, one head that hatched no friendly thoughts, because the"
5654,EXTRACT.,"heart swelled with malice and envy. Unferth it was, the king's own"
5655,EXTRACT.,"story-teller, who sat at his feet, to be ready at all times to"
5656,EXTRACT.,amuse him. He broached a quarrelsome theme--an adventure in
5657,EXTRACT.,"Beowulf's youth, the only contest in his record the issue of"
5658,EXTRACT.,"which, though hard fought, might be called doubtful. For this"
5659,EXTRACT.,"Unferth was an envious wight, whose soul grudged that any man"
5660,EXTRACT.,should achieve greater things than himself.
5661,EXTRACT.,
5662,EXTRACT.,"'Art thou not,' he began tauntingly, 'that same Beowulf who strove"

5665,EXTRACT.,could turn you from the foolish venture? A se'nnight ye twain
5666,EXTRACT.,"toiled in the realm of the waters, and, if I err not, he outdid"

5672,EXTRACT.,_Criticism of the Paraphrase._
5673,EXTRACT.,
5674,EXTRACT.,It may be inferred from the dependence upon the work of Earle that Miss
5675,EXTRACT.,Ragozin's knowledge of Old English is of the slightest. This inference
5676,EXTRACT.,"is borne out by frequent misapprehension of the original sense, due in"
5677,EXTRACT.,"large measure to the use of a single translation. Thus on page 245,"
5678,EXTRACT.,"Grendel is called 'the God-sent scourge,' and, again, on p. 322, Beowulf"
5679,EXTRACT.,is described as having been 'most genial to his nobles.' Both of these
5680,EXTRACT.,errors are due to misapprehension of Professor Earle's translation. The
5681,EXTRACT.,list of proper names on p. 331 reveals an ignorance of some fundamental
5682,EXTRACT.,"facts of Old English pronunciation. Of course, an intimate knowledge of"
5683,EXTRACT.,the Beowulf style and diction is not indispensable to the writer of a
5684,EXTRACT.,"paraphrase, but the writer who has it will naturally be superior to the"
5685,EXTRACT.,"writer without it. For illustration, Miss Thomson[2] never misinterprets"
5686,EXTRACT.,"a passage as does Miss Ragozin on page 264, where nearly every sentence"
5687,EXTRACT.,is false to the Beowulf manner.
5688,EXTRACT.,
5689,EXTRACT.,The paraphrase is slightly disfigured by the distinctively Romance words
5690,EXTRACT.,which disfigure Earle's translation.
5691,EXTRACT.,
5692,EXTRACT.,But these slight defects need not blind us to the service done by Miss
5693,EXTRACT.,"Ragozin in making Beowulf accessible to school children. The style is,"
5694,EXTRACT.,"in general, strong and effective, not without some of the beauty and"
5695,EXTRACT.,"dignity of the Old English, but relieved of the more obscure and"
5696,EXTRACT.,recondite features of that style.

5753,EXTRACT.,"enterprise, for he was one who could not endure that any man under"
5754,EXTRACT.,heaven should do greater deeds than himself. Therefore he stood up

5761,EXTRACT.,"the land of the Heathoram, whence he journeyed back to the city of"

5776,EXTRACT.,in the forms of the proper names. Such forms as these occur in his book:
5777,EXTRACT.,"Veleda, Hugon, Weopstan (sic), Hrethin, Hrethet."
5778,EXTRACT.,
5779,EXTRACT.,The diction is unfortunate. The coast-warden becomes a 'squire' (p. 7);
5780,EXTRACT.,"Heorot is a 'banqueting hall' (p. 4, showing the influence of Kemble's"
5781,EXTRACT.,"translation); Beowulf and Breca were 'pages at the King's court' (p. 13,"
5782,EXTRACT.,showing the influence of Earle's translation).
5783,EXTRACT.,
5784,EXTRACT.,"Petty inaccuracies occur throughout, such as, 'I counsel that thou"
5785,EXTRACT.,refuse not' (p. 9); 'A faithful squire must needs know the troubles of
5786,EXTRACT.,his lord' (p. 7). In point of accuracy this version is quite inferior to
5787,EXTRACT.,the work of Miss Thomson[3]; and in point of style and atmosphere to
5788,EXTRACT.,"that of Mr. Jones[4], Miss Ragozin[5], or Miss Thomson. The book,"
5789,EXTRACT.,"however, is readable, and the author's name will doubtless serve to give"
5790,EXTRACT.,it a certain success.

5851,EXTRACT.,"honoured him for his generous thought in coming to their help,"
5852,EXTRACT.,"there was one who looked on him with dislike and envy, and was"
5853,EXTRACT.,"jealous of the favour shown him by the king. This was Hunferth,"
5854,EXTRACT.,who was sitting on the daïs at Hrothgar's feet. And when he heard
5855,EXTRACT.,"what this visitor intended to do, he grew angry and moody, because"
5856,EXTRACT.,he could not bear that any other man on earth should obtain
5857,EXTRACT.,greater honour than he himself. So he began to rake up old tales
5858,EXTRACT.,"that he had heard of Beowulf, and tried to turn them to his hurt,"
5859,EXTRACT.,saying scornfully:
5860,EXTRACT.,
5861,EXTRACT.,'Art thou that Beowulf who once strove on the wide sea in a
5862,EXTRACT.,"swimming-match with Breca, when ye two in boasting dared to breast"
5863,EXTRACT.,"the wave, and for vainglory risked your lives in the deep water?"
5864,EXTRACT.,"There was no man, friend nor foe, who could dissuade you from that"
5865,EXTRACT.,"sorrowful journey; but ye swam in the surf, stretching out your"
5866,EXTRACT.,"arms over the waves, and stirring up the surge with your hands. So"
5867,EXTRACT.,"did ye glide across the ocean, while the waves weltered in wintry"
5868,EXTRACT.,"storms, and for seven nights ye laboured in the tumult of the"
5869,EXTRACT.,"seas. But in the end the victory was with Breca, for his might was"
5870,EXTRACT.,the greater. Then on the morning of the eighth day the tide bore
5871,EXTRACT.,"him to the shore of Norway, whence he visited his beloved home,"
5872,EXTRACT.,"the fair city of safety, where he ruled over many people, over"
5873,EXTRACT.,towns and treasure. Truly he did perform all his boast against
5874,EXTRACT.,thee.'

5879,EXTRACT.,"In the opinion of the present writer, no better paraphrase of _Beowulf_"
5880,EXTRACT.,exists.
5881,EXTRACT.,
5882,EXTRACT.,It is perhaps unfortunate that the word 'translated' is used on the
5883,EXTRACT.,"title-page, for this is misleading. The proper form is that used on the"
5884,EXTRACT.,"cover of the book, 'Beowulf, told by Miss Clara Thomson.'"
5885,EXTRACT.,
5886,EXTRACT.,It were sufficient praise to point out that the author has contrived to
5887,EXTRACT.,"retain practically all of the poem, without ever falsifying its spirit"
5888,EXTRACT.,by introducing a superabundance of explanatory phrases[2]. She is always
5889,EXTRACT.,"true to the story (as Miss Ragozin[3] is not, for example, in the first"
5890,EXTRACT.,section of her work); she is equally true to the spirit of the poem (as
5891,EXTRACT.,"Mr. Gibb[4] is not). The style is both vigorous and simple, not unworthy"
5892,EXTRACT.,of the story it tells.
5893,EXTRACT.,
5894,EXTRACT.,"It will be surprising if Miss Thomson's work is not popular in England,"
