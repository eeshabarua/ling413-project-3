65,PREFACE,PREFACE
66,PREFACE,
67,PREFACE,
68,PREFACE,The type of poetry commonly known as heroic is one which makes its
69,PREFACE,appearance in various nations and in various periods of history. No
70,PREFACE,one can fail to observe that certain similar features are to be found
71,PREFACE,in poems of this type which are widely separated from one another both
72,PREFACE,in date and place of origin. In view of this fact it has seemed worth
73,PREFACE,while to attempt a comparative study of two groups of such poems with
74,PREFACE,the object of determining the nature of the resemblances between them
75,PREFACE,and the causes to which they are due. Occasional illustrations have
76,PREFACE,been taken from other groups of poems belonging to the same type.
77,PREFACE,
78,PREFACE,The first part of the book deals with the early heroic poetry and
79,PREFACE,"traditions of the Teutonic peoples, more especially with those stories"
80,PREFACE,which were the common property of various Teutonic peoples. It is
81,PREFACE,pointed out that these stories all relate to a period with definite
82,PREFACE,limits--a period for which a considerable amount of information is
83,PREFACE,available from external sources. The subjects discussed include
84,PREFACE,the distribution of the stories and the relationship between the
85,PREFACE,"various versions of them, the antiquity of the earliest poems and the"
86,PREFACE,"conditions under which they were produced. Lastly, an attempt has been"
87,PREFACE,"made to estimate the significance of the various elements, historical,"
88,PREFACE,"mythical and fictitious, of which the stories are composed."
89,PREFACE,
90,PREFACE,The second part deals with Greek heroic poetry and traditions. These
91,PREFACE,relate to a period for which little or no external evidence is
92,PREFACE,"available; and consequently they present many problems, the bearings"
93,PREFACE,of which can hardly be estimated without reference to the existence
94,PREFACE,of similar phenomena elsewhere. In general I have followed the same
95,PREFACE,"plan as in the first part, and made use throughout of the results"
96,PREFACE,obtained there. If some excuse is necessary for dealing with so well
97,PREFACE,"worn a theme I may plead that, so far as my knowledge goes, it has not"
98,PREFACE,hitherto been approached from this point of view.
99,PREFACE,
100,PREFACE,In the third part attention has been called to the existence of a
101,PREFACE,number of somewhat striking characteristics common to the two groups
102,PREFACE,of poems and an attempt made to account for them. The conclusion to
103,PREFACE,which I have been brought is that the resemblances in the poems are
104,PREFACE,due primarily to resemblances in the ages to which they relate and to
105,PREFACE,which they ultimately owe their origin. The comparative study of heroic
106,PREFACE,poetry therefore involves the comparative study of 'Heroic Ages'; and
107,PREFACE,the problems which it presents are essentially problems of anthropology.
108,PREFACE,
109,PREFACE,In this conclusion I am glad to find myself in agreement with Dr
110,PREFACE,"Haddon, who suggested to me that a comparative study of this kind would"
111,PREFACE,be a suitable subject for the Cambridge Archaeological and Ethnological
112,PREFACE,Series. I take this opportunity of thanking him for bringing the matter
113,PREFACE,before the Syndics of the University Press and for the interest which
114,PREFACE,he has kindly taken in the progress of the work.
115,PREFACE,
116,PREFACE,Owing to the pressure of teaching and other duties a considerable time
117,PREFACE,has unfortunately elapsed since the earlier portions of the book were
118,PREFACE,printed. I would therefore respectfully call the reader's attention
119,PREFACE,"to the list of Addenda at the end, where references will be found to"
120,PREFACE,several important works which have appeared in the meantime.
121,PREFACE,
122,PREFACE,"In a work, such as this, which deals with records preserved in a number"
123,PREFACE,"of different languages, difficulties necessarily arise with regard to"
124,PREFACE,the spelling of proper names. In the representation of Teutonic names
125,PREFACE,the system adopted in my previous books has in general been retained.
126,PREFACE,"Any such system is of course open to objections, of the cogency of"
127,PREFACE,which I am quite aware; and consequently I have not felt inclined to
128,PREFACE,carry out my scheme with rigid consistency. The same remarks apply to
129,PREFACE,the representation of Greek names--which will doubtless displease many
130,PREFACE,critics. South Slavonic names and words are given according to the
131,PREFACE,usual Croatian orthography.
132,PREFACE,
133,PREFACE,I cannot attempt here to enumerate the various scholars to whose
134,PREFACE,writings I am indebted. It will be seen that they are many and that
135,PREFACE,much of what I have had to do is in the nature of criticism. One name
136,PREFACE,"however, that of Professor Ridgeway, I cannot leave unmentioned, since"
137,PREFACE,it is largely to his inspiring influence--by no means through his
138,PREFACE,writings alone--that my interest in these subjects is due.
139,PREFACE,
140,PREFACE,It remains for me to record my obligations to a number of friends who
141,PREFACE,have generously responded to my requests for information or criticism
142,PREFACE,"on various points. In particular I must mention Miss A. C. Paues, Mr"
143,PREFACE,"A. B. Cook, Dr W. H. R. Rivers, Mr S. A. Cook, Professor J. W. H."
144,PREFACE,"Atkins, Professor A. Mawer, Mr E. H. Minns and Mr F. W. Green. Above"
145,PREFACE,"all I am indebted to Mr E. C. Quiggin and Mr F. G. M. Beck, who have"
146,PREFACE,most kindly read through a considerable part of the book in proof
147,PREFACE,and several chapters even in manuscript. It is scarcely necessary to
148,PREFACE,add that in the sections dealing with Celtic history and poetry Mr
149,PREFACE,Quiggin's criticism has been of the greatest value to me. My thanks
150,PREFACE,"are due, further, to my pupils, Mr C. A. Scutt, of Clare College, and"
151,PREFACE,"Mr Bruce Dickins, of Magdalene College, for similar kind services in"
152,PREFACE,the proofs of the later chapters. From the staff of the University
153,PREFACE,Library--in particular I must mention Mr A. Rogers and Mr O. Johnson--I
154,PREFACE,have received the same unfailing and courteous attention as in the
155,PREFACE,"past. Lastly, I have to thank the Syndics of the University Press for"
156,PREFACE,undertaking the publication of the book and the staff for the efficient
157,PREFACE,and obliging way in which the printing and corrections have been
158,PREFACE,carried out.

267,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
268,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
269,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,The remains of English poetry which have come down to us from times
270,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,anterior to the Norman conquest are mainly of a religious character and
271,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,deal with the lives of saints or with subjects derived from the Bible
272,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,or ecclesiastical tradition. The secular poems are comparatively few
273,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"in number and, with one exception, of inconsiderable length. Most of"
274,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"them are narrative poems, and admit of a very obvious classification"
275,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,according to the choice of subjects with which they are concerned. One
276,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,group deals with the exploits of English kings and noblemen of the
277,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"tenth century, the other with the exploits and adventures of persons"
278,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,who did not belong to this country. We will take the second group of
279,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"poems first, as it is admitted by all authorities to be the earlier of"
280,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,the two.
281,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
282,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"The longest poem of this class is Beowulf, an epic of 3183 verses, the"
283,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"subject of which briefly is as follows: Hrothgar, king of the Danes,"
284,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"has built a splendid hall, but is unable to enjoy the use of it on"
285,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"account of the ravages of a monster named Grendel, who attacks the"
286,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"hall by night and devours all whom he finds there. Beowulf, a nephew"
287,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"of Hygelac, king of the Geatas, hearing of Hrothgar's distress comes"
288,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,to his help and destroys first the monster himself and then his mother
289,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,who had come to exact vengeance. He is thanked and rewarded for his
290,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"exploits by Hrothgar, and returns to his own home. After this a long"
291,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,period is supposed to elapse. Hygelac has perished in an expedition
292,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"against the Frisians, and his son Heardred has been slain by the"
293,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Swedes. Beowulf has succeeded to the throne and reigned many years. In
294,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"his old age he resolves to attack a dragon which is ravaging the land,"
295,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"and in spite of the cowardice of his followers, of whom all except one"
296,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"forsake him, he eventually succeeds in destroying it, though not before"
297,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,he has himself received a mortal wound. The poem ends with an account
298,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,of his funeral.
299,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
300,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,The action is interrupted a good many times by references to incidents
301,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"in the history of the royal families of the Danes and the Geatas,"
302,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,particularly to Hygelac's fatal expedition and to the dealings of his
303,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"family with the Swedish kings Ongentheow, Onela and Eadgils. We find"
304,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"also a number of allusions to heroes of the past such as Sigemund,"
305,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Eormenric, Finn and Offa, who are known to us from other sources."
306,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
307,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,To the same class of poetry belong some fragments dealing with the
308,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,stories of Finn and Waldhere. The fragment relating to Finn is very
309,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,obscure and indeed would be quite unintelligible were it not for a
310,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,passage in Beowulf (vv. 1068-1159) where the same story is introduced
311,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"as the subject of a recitation by Hrothgar's minstrel. A certain Hnaef,"
312,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"represented as a vassal of Healfdene, Hrothgar's father, was slain in"
313,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"a fortress belonging to Finn, king of the Frisians. His followers made"
314,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,so brave a defence that Finn was compelled to come to terms with them.
315,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Subsequently, when an opportunity presented itself they took vengeance"
316,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,upon Finn and slew him. The fragment gives an account of the fighting
317,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"which took place, probably in the encounter immediately after Hnaef's"
318,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,death.
319,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
320,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,The story of Waldhere is well known from German sources which we
321,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,shall have to mention presently. One of the fragments is taken up by
322,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"an altercation between Waldhere and the Burgundian king Guthhere,"
323,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"before they begin to fight, while the other contains an exhortation to"
324,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Waldhere by the lady to acquit himself bravely.
325,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
326,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Widsith, though not an epic poem itself, refers to a large number of"
327,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"the characters which figure in Beowulf, Finn and Waldhere. It is stated"
328,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"that the poet was in the service of a certain Eadgils, prince of the"
329,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Myrgingas, and that in company with Ealhhild, apparently a princess of"
330,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"the same family, he visited the court of the Gothic king Eormenric. The"
331,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,greater part of the poem is taken up with lists of peoples which he
332,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,had visited and of famous princes whom he knew personally or by report.
333,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
334,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,The elegy of Deor consists of a number of brief notices of misfortunes
335,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"which had befallen various persons, Weland and Beaduhild, Geat,"
336,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Theodric and the subjects of Eormenric. Each notice ends with a refrain
337,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,expressing the belief or hope that the poet will be able to survive his
338,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,misfortunes as they did. At the end he says that he had been the bard
339,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"of the Heodeningas, but that his office had been taken away from him"
340,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,and given to a skilful minstrel named Heorrenda.
341,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
342,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,In a later chapter we shall have to discuss the question when these
343,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,poems were composed. At present it will be enough to remark that though
344,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,the MSS. in which they are preserved date only from the tenth or
345,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,eleventh centuries almost all scholars agree that the poems themselves
346,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"cannot be later than the eighth century, while probably the majority"
347,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"would refer their composition, in part at least to the seventh. In"
348,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"their present form they cannot be earlier than this, for with the"
349,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,exception of the Finn-fragment all of them contain Christian allusions.
350,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
351,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,The later group of secular narrative poems may best be described as
352,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,historical. The earliest of them celebrates the battle of Brunanburh
353,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,won by Aethelstan in 937 over the Scottish king Constantine II and
354,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,his Scandinavian allies. Others describe Edmund's conquest of the
355,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Five Boroughs, the coronation of Edgar, the glories of his reign, the"
356,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"troubles which followed, and lastly the death of Edward the Confessor."
357,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,The longest of all is a detailed account of the disastrous battle of
358,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Maldon, in which Byrhtnoth, earl of Essex, lost his life. All these"
359,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,pieces except the last are found inserted in texts of the Saxon
360,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Chronicle and all without exception appear to have been composed soon
361,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,after the events which they commemorate.
362,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
363,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,In addition to the above there are a number of other short poems which
364,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,are not essentially of a religious character. The most important of
365,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"these are the Wanderer, the Wife's Complaint, the Husband's Message and"
366,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,the Ruin--to which we may perhaps add the first half of the Seafarer.
367,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"They are probably all of fairly early date, but they differ from the"
368,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,poems we have been discussing in the fact that they contain no proper
369,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,names. Those of them which can be called narrative deal apparently
370,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,with typical characters or situations. A certain amount of magical and
371,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"gnomic poetry has also survived, while metrical riddles are numerous,"
372,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,but these need not concern us here.
373,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
374,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,It is scarcely open to doubt that a large amount of Anglo-Saxon
375,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,narrative poetry has perished. Several historical poems and ballads
376,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"of the tenth and eleventh centuries, now lost, can be traced in texts"
377,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,of the Saxon Chronicle and in Latin works[1]. Attempts have been made
378,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,also to show that narrative poems were used by the compilers of the
379,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,early part of the Chronicle and by several Latin histories referring
380,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"to the same period, but the evidence adduced is very doubtful. Perhaps"
381,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"the most likely case is the story of Hengest and Horsa, especially"
382,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,in the form in which it appears in the Historia Brittonum. On the
383,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"other hand it is probable that parts of the Vitae Duorum Offarum, a"
384,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"St Albans work dating from the beginning of the thirteenth century,"
385,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,are derived ultimately from poems which described Offa's single combat
386,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,and marriage--incidents to which we find brief references in Widsith
387,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,and Beowulf respectively. A similar origin may perhaps be claimed for
388,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Walter Map's story (_De Nugis Curialium_, II 17) of Gado (Wada). A few"
389,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"corrupt verses of a poem on this subject, obviously of late date, have"
390,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,been preserved in a Latin homily[2].
391,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
392,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,The earlier and later groups of narrative poems have in general[3] the
393,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,same metrical form and on the whole a very similar terminology. The
394,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,love of battle-scenes is also common to both. In other respects however
395,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,they differ greatly. Here we need only notice the entire difference
396,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,in subject-matter; the poems of the second group contain no allusion
397,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"to the subjects of the first. Much greater changes however, both in"
398,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"form and matter, are noticeable when English poetry reappears in the"
399,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The majority of these poems are
400,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"of French origin. But even when the scene is laid in England, the"
401,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,subjects are usually drawn from written sources--which is certainly
402,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,not the case with the historical poems of the tenth century. To the
403,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,subjects of the earlier group of Anglo-Saxon poems there is scarcely a
404,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,reference.
405,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
406,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,The period of German literature which corresponds chronologically to
407,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,the Anglo-Saxon period in England is far inferior to the latter in
408,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,remains of secular narrative poetry. We possess only one fragment of a
409,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"poem somewhat similar to the Finn-fragment, preserved in a MS. dating"
410,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"from about 800, and one poem of somewhat later date, celebrating a"
411,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"victory of Ludwig III, king of the West Franks. To these we may add"
412,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"three or four very short metrical charms, similar to the Anglo-Saxon"
413,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,magical pieces mentioned above.
414,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
415,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,The subject of the first of these poems is as follows: Hildebrand
416,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,(_Hiltibrant_) is an old warrior who has left his country with Dietrich
417,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"(_Theotrih_) and served with the Huns. On his return from exile, thirty"
418,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"years later, he is challenged by a young warrior named Hadubrand. In"
419,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,the altercation with which the piece opens Hildebrand discovers that
420,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"his opponent is his own son, acquaints him with the fact and tries to"
421,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,dissuade him from the combat with offers of rich presents. But the
422,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"young man refuses to believe him, and taunts him with cowardice and"
423,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,guile in trying to put him off his guard. Hildebrand is therefore
424,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"obliged to fight, and the fragment comes to an end in the midst of the"
425,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,encounter.
426,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
427,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,The Ludwigslied is a poem of fifty-nine verses celebrating the praises
428,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"of Ludwig III, with special reference to his victory over the Northmen"
429,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"at Saucourt in 881, and seems to have been composed before the king's"
430,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,death in the following year. It is not in the old Teutonic alliterative
431,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"metre which we find in Anglo-Saxon poetry and in the Hildebrandslied,"
432,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,but in the later rhyming verse. The religious element is prominent
433,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,throughout.
434,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
435,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,There is no doubt that a considerable amount of secular narrative
436,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,poetry once existed in German. Einhard in his Life of Charlemagne
437,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,(cap. 29) states that the emperor collected native and very ancient
438,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,poems in which were related the deeds and battles of kings of former
439,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,times[4]. But during the following centuries poetry of this kind seems
440,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,to have gone entirely out of favour among the higher classes. We do
441,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,indeed find occasional references to such poems in later Latin works.
442,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,In particular the Annals of Quedlinburg have incorporated from them a
443,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"number of notices relating to Eormenric, Theodric (_Thideric de Berne_)"
444,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,and other heroes of antiquity. But here it is expressly stated that it
445,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,was among the peasants (_rustici_) that these poems were known. Other
446,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Latin chronicles cite lost poems relating to persons and events of the
447,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"tenth century, which may have been somewhat similar to the contemporary"
448,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Anglo-Saxon poems, though generally they appear to have been of a less"
449,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,serious character.
450,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
451,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Some compensation for the loss of early German poetry is afforded by
452,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"the preservation of a few Latin poems, of which the most important is"
453,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"_Waltharius manu fortis_, composed probably about 930 by Ekkehard of"
454,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,St Gall. The subject is the same as that of the Anglo-Saxon Waldhere
455,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"fragments. Waltharius and Hiltgund, the son and daughter respectively"
456,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"of two princes in Gaul, were betrothed in their childhood, but had"
457,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"to be given up as hostages to Attila, king of the Huns. After many"
458,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,years they escaped and carried off with them much treasure. Hearing of
459,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"this, King Guntharius, who dwelt at Worms, determined to waylay them"
460,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"and set out with twelve warriors, among them the brave Hagano who had"
461,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,formerly shared Waltharius' exile. Waltharius is overtaken in a defile
462,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,of the Vosges and slays eleven of the warriors in single combat. In
463,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"his final encounter with Hagano and Guntharius all three are crippled,"
464,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,but Waltharius is able to make his way home with Hiltgund. There are
465,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"other poems, one of which combines German with Latin in each verse,"
466,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,celebrating the deeds of the contemporary Saxon emperors and their
467,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,relatives.
468,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
469,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"The second period of German literature, beginning in the twelfth"
470,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"century, is incomparably superior to the first in the amount of"
471,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,secular narrative poetry which it has left behind. Here we need only
472,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,concern ourselves with those poems which draw their subjects from
473,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,ancient native traditions. These are mostly anonymous and come from the
474,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"southern districts, especially Austria and Bavaria. Their metrical form"
475,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,is modern and similar to that of other poetry of the same period. The
476,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"best known of these poems is the Nibelungenlied, which dates from the"
477,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,beginning of the thirteenth century. Only a very brief résumé of its
478,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,contents can be given here.
479,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
480,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Siegfried (_Sîvrit_), the son of Siegmund, comes from Xanten to Worms"
481,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"and asks for the hand of Kriemhild, the sister of the Burgundian"
482,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,king Gunther. He joins Gunther in his campaigns and by magical arts
483,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,enables him to win the amazon Brünhild (_Prünhilt_) for his bride.
484,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"The two wives quarrel, and Brünhild learns from Kriemhild of the part"
485,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,played by Siegfried towards her. On hearing this she begins to long
486,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"for his death, and eventually he is murdered at a hunting party by"
487,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Hagen (_Hagene_), the chief of Gunther's knights. Hagen also deprives"
488,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Kriemhild of Siegfried's treasure (_der Nibelunge hort_) and sinks it
489,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"in the Rhine. Kriemhild is afterwards married to Etzel, king of the"
490,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Huns and, burning for vengeance, persuades him to invite Gunther on a"
491,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"visit, together with his brothers Gernot and Giselher and also Hagen."
492,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Soon after their arrival she brings about a quarrel, and after a huge"
493,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"slaughter on both sides, Gunther and Hagen, who have lost all their"
494,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"men, are captured by Dietrich von Bern, Etzel's vassal. Kriemhild puts"
495,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"them to death, violating the oath which she had given to spare them,"
496,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"and in anger at this treachery Hildebrand, Dietrich's old retainer,"
497,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,slays her.
498,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
499,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Closely connected in subject with the Nibelungenlied is the Klage,"
500,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,which describes the funeral of those slain in the fighting with Gunther
501,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"and the lamentation over them. Here too we may notice the Seyfridslied,"
502,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,though in the form in which it has come down to us it belongs to a
503,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,much later period. In reality it is clearly a combination of two
504,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"different ballads, both of which deal with Siegfried's early years. The"
505,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,first relates how he was brought up by a smith and slew a dragon. The
506,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,second gives an account of another similar adventure--this time with a
507,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,fiery dragon which had carried off Kriemhild from her father's home.
508,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Siegfried kills the dragon and at the same time takes possession of the
509,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"treasure of certain dwarfs, the sons of Nybling."
510,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
511,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,A number of other medieval poems deal with the adventures of Dietrich
512,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,von Bern and his knights. Alpharts Tod tells the story of the young
513,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"knight Alphart, Hildebrand's nephew, and his encounter with two of"
514,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Ermenrich's warriors named Witege and Heime, by the former of whom"
515,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,he was treacherously slain. Dietrichs Flucht relates how Ermenrich
516,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,(_Ermrich_) was instigated by an evil counseller named Sibeche to plot
517,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"destruction for his nephew Dietrich. Though the plot fails, Hildebrand"
518,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"and several of Dietrich's other knights are captured and imprisoned,"
519,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,and in order to obtain their release Dietrich is forced to go into
520,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,exile. In the Rabenschlacht we are told how Dietrich with the help
521,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,of Etzel set out to recover his inheritance. While he is engaged in
522,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"battle with Ermenrich, his brother Diether and two young sons of Etzel"
523,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"are slain by Witege. Dietrich rides after Witege to exact vengeance,"
524,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,but Witege disappears in the sea. Virginal describes how Dietrich
525,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,was imprisoned by a giant in a castle called Muter and rescued by
526,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Hildebrand, Witege, Heime and others. Further adventures with giants"
527,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"and dwarfs are related in the Eckenlied, Sigenot and Laurin. In the"
528,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Rosengarten Dietrich is made to fight with Siegfried.
529,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
530,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,The story of Wolfdietrich and Ortnit has come down to us in several
531,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"different forms, but the outline may be given briefly as follows."
532,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Wolfdietrich, the son of king Hugdietrich, is kept out of his"
533,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,inheritance by his brothers or their guardian Saben on the ground of
534,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"illegitimacy. He betakes himself to a faithful old knight, Berchtung of"
535,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Meran, who raises an army to help him. But in the battle that ensues"
536,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Berchtung and his sons are all slain or captured, and Wolfdietrich has"
537,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,to go into exile. He then marries the widow of a king named Ortnit and
538,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,destroys the dragon which had killed him. Eventually he succeeds in
539,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,winning his father's kingdom and releasing his faithful followers. Some
540,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,elements of this story appear to have been incorporated in the romance
541,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,of King Rother.
542,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
543,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,The story of the poem Kûdrûn falls naturally into two parts. In the
544,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"first Hetel (_Hetele_), king of Denmark, hears of Hilde, a princess of"
545,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Ireland and desires to marry her. As her father, the fierce Hagen, will"
546,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"not consent, Hetel's warriors Wate, Fruote and Hôrand carry her off."
547,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Hagen pursues them to Denmark, but in the fight which follows he is"
548,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,nearly killed by Wate. Finally a reconciliation takes place and Hilde
549,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,is allowed to marry Hetel. In the second part Hartmuot and Herwig are
550,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"suitors for Kûdrûn, the daughter of Hetel and Hilde. The latter is at"
551,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"length accepted, but Kûdrûn is carried off by Hartmuot and his father"
552,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Ludwig (_Ludewîc_). A pursuit follows and Hetel is killed by Ludwig.
553,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Kûdrûn is kept at Hartmuot's home for seven years, harshly treated by"
554,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"his mother Gerlind, because she will not consent to become his wife. At"
555,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"last Herwig and her brother Ortwîn with the warriors Wate, Fruote and"
556,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Hôrand come and rescue her. Ludwig is killed but Hartmuot is spared at
557,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Kûdrûn's intercession.
558,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
559,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,In conclusion mention must be made of some fragments of a poem dealing
560,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,with Walther and Hildegund. The subject seems to have been identical
561,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,with that of Ekkehard's Waltharius. Reminiscences of other ancient
562,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,stories are occasionally to be found in poems of a romantic character.
563,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Among these we may note especially the poem Herzog Friedrich von
564,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Schwaben, a portion of which seems to be derived from the story of"
565,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Weland.
566,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
567,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"The North German dialects have no poetry of this type, except a few"
568,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"ballads dating from much later times, of which the most important is"
569,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"one on Eormenric's death. But a great mass of legend, derived chiefly"
570,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"from North German sources, is preserved in the Norse work Thiðreks"
571,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Saga af Bern, which dates from about the middle of the thirteenth"
572,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,century. The characters are for the most part identical with those
573,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"which figure in the High German epics, Dietrich von Bern, Ermenrich,"
574,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Witege, Walther, Siegfried etc. Traces of poems of much earlier date"
575,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,have been sought in several Latin chronicles. Besides the references in
576,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"the Annals of Quedlinburg, to which we have already alluded, mention"
577,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,may be made of the Saxon stories given by Widukind and the Translatio
578,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"S. Alexandri, especially that of the victory over the Thuringian king"
579,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Irminfrith.
580,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
581,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"The vernacular poetry of the Langobardi has entirely perished, but a"
582,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,number of stories given by the Latin historians are thought to be
583,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,based on early poems. The first and most striking of these is the
584,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"account of the battle with the Vandals, in which the two armies appeal"
585,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,for victory to Wodan and Fria respectively[5]. A similar origin has
586,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"been claimed for several other narratives, such as that of Alboin's"
587,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"visit to Turisind, king of the Gepidae, and more especially the story"
588,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,of Authari and Theudelinda[6].
589,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
590,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,The Gothic historian Jordanes states (cap. 5) that his compatriots
591,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"were wont to celebrate the deeds of their famous men in poetry, and it"
592,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,is probable that many of the legends which he gives were ultimately
593,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,derived from such poems. Among them we may include not only the story
594,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,of Filimer and the migration to the Black Sea (cap. 4)--in which
595,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,case ancient poems are expressly mentioned--but also perhaps that of
596,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,the first migration under Berig (_ib._) and some part of the account
597,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"of Ostrogotha (cap. 16 f.), as well as the incidental reference to"
598,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Vidigoia's death (cap. 34). In the story of Hermanaricus also several
599,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"incidents, notably the death of Sunilda and the vengeance subsequently"
600,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"exacted by her brothers Sarus and Ammius (cap. 24), suggest a tradition"
601,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,preserved in poetic form.
602,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
603,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,No Scandinavian country except Iceland[7] has preserved any early poems
604,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,in its native language. The ancient literature of Iceland however
605,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,is peculiarly rich in secular narrative poetry. Moreover though the
606,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,earliest of these poems are probably quite two centuries later than
607,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Beowulf, they are entirely free from Christian influence. Indeed it"
608,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,can hardly be doubted that a considerable proportion of them date from
609,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,heathen times.
610,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
611,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,It will be convenient to begin with the collection of poems usually
612,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,known as the Older Edda. These are all anonymous; but most of them are
613,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"generally believed to belong to the tenth century, while a few may"
614,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,really have been composed in Norway at a still earlier date. Eleven of
615,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"these poems deal exclusively, or almost exclusively, with gods, giants"
616,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"and other supernatural beings, and hence stand quite apart from the"
617,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,class of poetry with which we are concerned. But since we shall have to
618,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,refer to them occasionally in the following pages it will be convenient
619,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,here to give a brief synopsis of their contents.
620,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
621,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Völuspá is a mythological poem in the form of a speech delivered to the
622,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,god Othin by a sibyl whom he is consulting. It deals with the origin
623,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"of the world, the history of the gods and their coming fate. Hávamál"
624,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,is a collection of proverbial wisdom and moral precepts of the heathen
625,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"age, with occasional references to myth and ritual. Vafþrúðnismál"
626,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,describes how Othin visited the giant Vafþrúðnir and entered into
627,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,a contest with him in mythological lore. The subject of Grímnismál
628,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"is a visit paid by Othin in disguise to a king named Geirröðr, who"
629,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,tortures him. Othin gives a long discourse on mythological matters
630,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"and finally reveals himself, whereupon the king stumbles over his"
631,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"sword and dies. Skírnismál relates how Skírnir, the servant of the"
632,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"god Frey, was sent to obtain for his master the hand of the giantess"
633,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Gerðr, of whom he had become passionately enamoured. Hárbarðslióð is"
634,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,taken up with an altercation between the god Thor and a ferryman called
635,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Hárbarðr (generally supposed to be Othin), who refuses to take him over"
636,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,a strait. Hýmiskviða gives an account of Thor's adventures when he
637,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,went to visit the giant Hýmir. Lokasenna is occupied with a number of
638,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,scandalous charges brought by Loki against various gods and goddesses
639,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,who have been invited to a feast by Aegir. Thrymskviða relates how the
640,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"giant Thrymr, having obtained possession of Thor's hammer, demanded"
641,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"the goddess Freyia as his bride, and how Thor came disguised as Freyia"
642,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,and slew the giant. Alvíssmál is a dialogue between Thor and the dwarf
643,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Alvíss, who is a suitor for his daughter. Thor detains the dwarf with"
644,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,questions on the various names of natural objects and phenomena until
645,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,the fatal moment of daybreak. Vegtamskviða describes how Othin went to
646,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,consult a sibyl on the impending fate of Balder.
647,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
648,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"In addition to these pieces, all of which probably come from one"
649,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"collection, there are two semi-mythical poems contained in other"
650,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,works. Rígsmál or Rígsþula relates how a certain Rígr (identified in
651,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,the introduction with the god Heimdallr) became the progenitor of
652,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,the three classes of men--the characteristics of which are described
653,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"at length. Hyndlulióð is mainly a genealogical poem, narrating how"
654,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Freyia went to consult the giantess Hyndla as to the ancestry of her
655,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"devotee, Óttarr the son of Innsteinn. It contains also some purely"
656,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,mythological matter which is generally supposed to have come from a
657,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,separate poem. Here also we may mention two pieces known as Grógaldr
658,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"and Fiölsvinnsmál, which clearly belong together. In the former"
659,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Svipdagr calls up the spirit of Gróa, his mother; in the latter he"
660,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"comes to the enchanted abode of Menglöð and, after many questions with"
661,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"the gatekeeper, is at length recognised as her destined lover. In much"
662,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"later times we find Swedish and Danish versions of the same story, and"
663,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,there can be little doubt that it is really a folk-tale.
664,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
665,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,The purely mythological poems of the Edda are followed by
666,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Völundarkviða, which gives a fairly full account of the story of"
667,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Völundr (Weland). It describes how Völundr and his brothers obtained
668,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"as their wives three swan-maidens, who after eight years deserted"
669,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"them. Then Völundr is captured by a king named Níðuðr, hamstrung and"
670,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,compelled to work as his smith. Völundr executes vengeance on the
671,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,king's sons and daughter (Böðvildr) and then flies away.
672,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
673,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"The next poem, Helgakviða Hiörvarðssonar, gives in dialogue form a"
674,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,somewhat complicated story of the adventures of a king named Hiörvarðr
675,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"and his son Helgi. A different Helgi, the son of Sigmundr, is the"
676,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"subject of the two following poems, Helgakviður Hundingsbana. Both"
677,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,poems relate how the hero overthrew a king named Hundingr and how he
678,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"was afterwards summoned by Sigrún, the daughter of Högni, to save her"
679,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"from marriage to a prince named Höðbroddr, whom she detested. The first"
680,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,poem ends with Helgi's victory over Högni and Höðbroddr; but the second
681,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"goes on to describe how Dagr, the son of Högni, subsequently slew Helgi"
682,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"in revenge for his father. Sinfiötli, the son of Sigmundr, figures in"
683,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"both poems, but Sigurðr is not mentioned."
684,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
685,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"The next poem, Grípisspá, probably a late work, gives a summary of the"
686,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"adventures of Sigurðr, the son of Sigmundr, in the form of a dialogue"
687,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"between the hero and his uncle Grípir, who is endowed with prophecy."
688,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,This is followed by three pieces which may really be parts of one
689,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,original poem. The first (commonly called Reginsmál) relates how three
690,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"of the gods, Othin, Hoenir and Loki, killed a certain Otr, the son of"
691,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Hreiðmarr. Having to pay compensation to the father, Loki robbed a"
692,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"dwarf, named Andvari, of his gold. Andvari laid a curse on the gold,"
693,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"and Hreiðmarr was soon killed by his own son Fáfnir, who subsequently"
694,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"turned into a serpent.[8] Reginn, Fáfnir's brother, betook himself to"
695,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Sigurðr and became his attendant. The poem then goes on to describe
696,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,how a certain Hnikarr (Othin) guided Sigurðr on an expedition he
697,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,undertook against the sons of Hundingr. In the next piece (Fáfnismál)
698,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Sigurðr at Reginn's instigation attacks and kills Fáfnir. Then, finding"
699,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"that Reginn is plotting treachery, he slays him also and carries off"
700,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Fáfnir's gold. In the third (Sigrdrífumál) Sigurðr finds and wakens a
701,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"maid named Sigrdrífa, a valkyrie who has been punished by Othin with an"
702,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,enchanted sleep. She imparts to him much magical lore; but the close of
703,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,the poem is lost owing to a lacuna in the MS.
704,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
705,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Of the following nine poems six--Sigurðarkviða I (a fragment),"
706,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Guðrúnarkviða I, Sigurðarkviða II (_hin skamma_), Guðrúnarkviða II"
707,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"(_hin forna_), Atlakviða and Atlamál--deal with practically the same"
708,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"events as the Nibelungenlied. But unfortunately, owing to the lacuna in"
709,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,the MS. several poems at the beginning of the series have been lost.
710,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Hence in order to obtain a full account of the story it is necessary to
711,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"refer to the Völsunga Saga (see below), which used the lost poems as"
712,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,well as the others.
713,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
714,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,The chief variations from the German version of the story are as
715,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,follows: (i) Sigmundr has been killed before the birth of Sigurðr
716,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,(Siegfried) by the sons of Hundingr. (ii) The wife of Sigurðr is called
717,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Guðrún, Grímhildr being the name of her mother and Giúki that of her"
718,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,father. (iii) Brynhildr is the sister of Atli (Etzel). In several
719,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"authorities[9] she is identified with the valkyrie of Sigrdrífumál,"
720,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,and it is stated that she and Sigurðr had exchanged vows of love; but
721,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Sigurðr's love was subsequently turned to Guðrún through a magic potion
722,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,given him by Grímhildr. (iv) Högni (Hagen) is the brother of Gunnarr
723,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,(Gunther); and in place of Gernôt and Gîselher there is another brother
724,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"named Guthormr. It is the last-named who actually kills Sigurðr, and"
725,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,he is himself killed by the dying man. Brynhildr then puts herself to
726,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,death and is burned with Sigurðr. (v) The death of Gunnarr and Högni
727,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,is attributed to Atli. Guðrún on the other hand warns her brothers of
728,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"the treachery awaiting them, and subsequently avenges their deaths by"
729,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,killing Atli and the children he had had by her.
730,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
731,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Interspersed among these poems are three others connected with
732,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"the same story, but dealing with incidents unknown to the German"
733,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,version. The Helreið Brynhildar describes how Brynhildr on her way
734,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"to Hell encounters a giantess, to whom she tells the story of her"
735,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,life. Guðrúnarkviða III relates how Guðrún was accused to Atli of
736,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"adultery with Thióðrekr, but established her innocence by the ordeal."
737,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"In Oddrúnargrátr a sister of Atli named Oddrún comes to Borgný, the"
738,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"daughter of a certain Heiðrekr, to relieve her in her travail, and"
739,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"gives an account of the relations between herself, Brynhildr and"
740,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Gunnarr.
741,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
742,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,The last two poems--Guðrúnarhvöt and Hamðismál--are concerned with
743,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"the story of the attack upon Iörmunrekr (Hermanaricus), to Jordanes'"
744,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,account of which we have already alluded (p. 10). Here the story is
745,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,connected with the preceding poems[10] by the fact that Svanhildr
746,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"(Sunilda) is represented as the daughter of Guðrún and Sigurðr, while"
747,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Hamðir and Sörli (Ammius and Sarus) are said to be the sons of Guðrún
748,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"and a certain Iónakr, whom she had married after Atli's death. In the"
749,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,first poem Guðrún incites her sons to avenge their sister and then
750,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"bewails her many misfortunes. The second describes the actual fighting,"
751,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"preceded however by the account of a quarrel in which Erpr, a stepson"
752,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"of Guðrún, is killed by his half-brothers. To his death is attributed"
753,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"the fact that Iörmunrekr, was able to survive the onslaught, though he"
754,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,lost both hands and both feet.
755,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
756,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"The prose Edda (Skaldskaparmál, cap. 43) contains a poem, Grottasöngr,"
757,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,which gives the story of two giant maidens who had to grind gold and
758,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,peace for the Danish king Fróði. At the end there is an allusion to
759,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Halfdan and Hrólfr Kraki (see below). Besides this we have, both in"
760,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"the prose Edda and elsewhere, a number of fragments of poems, some"
761,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,of which refer to Sigurðr and his family and some to other stories.
762,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Among the latter mention may be made especially of a poem Biarkamál,"
763,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,which celebrated the achievements of the Danish king Hrólfr Kraki and
764,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,the heroism of his retinue in the battle wherein he lost his life. In
765,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Hervarar Saga large portions of an early poem relating to the Goths and
766,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Huns have been preserved.
767,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
768,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"In addition to the poems enumerated above, all of which are anonymous,"
769,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,we have also a number of works by known poets. Most of these deal
770,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,either wholly or in part with contemporary persons and events. The
771,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,earliest date from the ninth century and are of Norwegian origin.
772,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Probably the oldest of all are the fragments of Bragi Boddason, the"
773,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,chief of which is a description of his shield (Ragnarsdrápa). From
774,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"the reign of Harold the Fair-haired several poems are known, though"
775,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,nearly all of them are in a very fragmentary condition. Among them
776,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"may be mentioned especially the Ynglingatal of Thióðolfr of Hvín, a"
777,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"genealogical poem which traces the descent of Rögnvaldr, a cousin"
778,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"of Harold, from the ancient kings of the Swedes and the god Frey."
779,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Another famous work by the same poet was the Haustlöng, which dealt"
780,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,with mythological subjects. Next perhaps in importance to Thióðolfr
781,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"was Thórbiörn Hornklofi, from whom we have fragments of two poems"
782,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"(Hrafnsmál and Glymdrápa), celebrating the exploits of Harold. Somewhat"
783,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"later we hear of a poet named Goððormr Sindri, who is known chiefly"
784,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,from the remains of a work (Hákonardrápa) in honour of Haakon I. A
785,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"famous fragment (Eireksmál) by an unknown poet, dating from shortly"
786,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"after the middle of the tenth century, celebrates the death of King"
787,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Eiríkr Blóðöx and his reception by Othin in Valhalla. From this is
788,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"copied the Hákonarmál of Eyvindr Skaldaspillir, celebrating the death"
789,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,of Haakon I at the battle of Fitje (A.D. 961). The same poet also
790,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,composed a genealogical poem (Háleygiatal) in imitation of Ynglingatal.
791,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"In it he traced the ancestry of Haakon, earl of Lade, who ruled Norway"
792,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"from about 975 to 995, back through the kings of Hálogaland to Othin"
793,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,and Skaði.
794,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
795,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,From this time onwards the cultivation of poetry seems to have been
796,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"almost entirely limited to Icelanders, many of whom resided largely"
797,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,at the courts of various Scandinavian kings. Among them the most
798,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"noteworthy and almost the earliest was Egill Skallagrímsson, who"
799,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"lived from about 900 to 982. He is known chiefly from the Höfuðlausn,"
800,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"composed for Eiríkr Blóðöx in England, the Arinbiarnardrápa, in honour"
801,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"of his friend Arinbiörn, and the Sonatorrek, an elegy over one of his"
802,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,sons. Of his younger contemporaries perhaps the best known are Kormakr
803,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Ögmundarson and Einarr Helgason. The latter is famous chiefly for his
804,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"poem Vellekla, in which he celebrated the exploits of Earl Haakon."
805,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Many other distinguished poets flourished during the following half
806,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,century--down to the time of Harold III (Harðráði)--but it is not
807,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,necessary here to discuss their works.
808,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
809,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,By the time of Harold III the composition of prose narratives or sagas
810,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"(sögur) had already begun to be cultivated by Icelanders, though it"
811,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,was not until towards the end of the following century that they were
812,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,first committed to writing. Many sagas are based on old narrative
813,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"poems; as for instance Ynglinga Saga, which is largely a paraphrase and"
814,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"expansion of Ynglingatal. Völsunga Saga, which gives the stories of"
815,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Helgi, Sigurðr, Guðrún and Svanhildr, is derived mainly from the poems"
816,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"of the Edda, though it has used other materials. The earlier part,"
817,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,dealing with Sigmundr and his ancestors seems to have drawn upon some
818,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,lost poems. In Sörla Tháttr[11] we meet with a story--found also in the
819,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,prose Edda (Skaldsk. 50) and alluded to in Bragi's Ragnarsdrápa--which
820,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,is clearly connected with that of the first part of the German poem
821,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Kûdrûn. Hildr, the daughter of Högni, is carried off in her father's"
822,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"absence by his friend Heðinn. They are overtaken and a battle follows,"
823,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,in which all the combatants are killed. Hildr by magic spells rouses
824,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,the slain each night to renew the battle. In Hrólfs Saga Kraka we have
825,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"an account of the Danish kings Helgi and Hróarr, the sons of Halfdan,"
826,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"and of Helgi's son, Hrólfr Kraki, which seems to be derived ultimately"
827,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"from old poems like Biarkamál. Certain incidents in the story, such"
828,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"as Hrólfr's dealings with the Swedish king Aðils, are related also in"
829,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,other sagas. The same characters figured prominently in Skiöldunga
830,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Saga, of which we have little except an abridged Latin translation."
831,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"This saga also related at length the stories of Haraldr Hilditönn,"
832,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Sigurðr Hringr and Ragnarr Loðbrók, parts of which are known also from"
833,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"other sources, especially Ragnars Saga Loðbrókar and the Tháttr af"
834,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Loðbrókar sonum.
835,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
836,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Among Latin authorities the most important is the great Danish History
837,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"(_Gesta Danorum_) of Saxo Grammaticus, which dates from the end of"
838,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,the twelfth century and contains metrical translations or paraphrases
839,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,of many old poems. Of these perhaps the most noteworthy are the
840,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Biarkamál and some of the poems attributed to Starkaðr (Starcatherus),"
841,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,particularly those addressed to Ingialdr (Ingellus). Here also we find
842,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"a detailed account of the tragic story of Hagbarðr and Signý, which is"
843,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,very frequently alluded to in Old Norse poetry. Hagbarðr belonged to a
844,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,family which was involved in vendetta with the Danish king Sigarr. But
845,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"having fallen in love with Signý, the king's daughter, he visited her"
846,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,disguised as a woman--an adventure which ended in his being discovered
847,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,and condemned to death. Signý and all her maidens destroyed themselves
848,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,when he was led to the gallows. Many other stories are given entirely
849,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"in prose, among them those of Heðinn and Högni, Iörmunrekr and Helgi"
850,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Hundingsbani, though no mention is made of Sigmundr or Sigurðr. The"
851,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,adventures also of Haraldr Hilditönn and Ragnarr Loðbrók are related
852,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"at considerable length. Lastly, we may mention a story which is not"
853,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"recorded by any Icelandic authority, namely that of the single combat"
854,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,fought by Uffo the son of Wermundus. It deserves notice here on account
855,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,of its obvious identity with the English story of Offa.
856,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
857,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,In the course of this chapter we have reviewed briefly the secular
858,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,narrative poetry produced by the various Teutonic peoples down to the
859,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,end of the tenth century. In the case of works by historical Norwegian
860,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"and Icelandic poets, owing to the abundance of material, we have"
861,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,restricted ourselves to mentioning only the leading names. Elsewhere we
862,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,have endeavoured to give a more or less complete summary. On the other
863,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"hand, among works dating from later than the tenth century, we have"
864,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,taken into consideration only those which are concerned with stories
865,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,of ancient times. The stories themselves will be discussed in the
866,THE EARLY NARRATIVE POETRY OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,following chapters.

913,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
914,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,It will not have escaped notice that a large proportion of the stories
915,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,described or alluded to in the preceding chapter are found in the
916,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,literature of more than one nation. The most casual reader could not
917,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"fail to observe the identity of the story of Sigurðr and Guðrún,"
918,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"as given in the Edda and Völsunga Saga, with that of Siegfried and"
919,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Kriemhild related in the Nibelungenlied. Equally obvious is the
920,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,connection between the story of Iörmunrekr and Svanhildr in the same
921,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Scandinavian authorities and that of Hermanaricus and Sunilda given by
922,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Jordanes. A still closer resemblance is furnished by the Anglo-Saxon
923,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,poem Waldhere and the German-Latin Waltharius. The connection between
924,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,the German poem Kûdrûn and the Scandinavian story of Heðinn and
925,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Högni is perhaps less striking, but not open to question. The brief"
926,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,references to the story of Weland and Beaduhild in the Anglo-Saxon poem
927,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Deor are quite sufficient to prove its substantial identity with that
928,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,told in Völundarkviða.
929,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
930,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"In other cases the same characters appear, though the incidents"
931,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,related are different. Eormenric (Ermenrich) is a prominent figure in
932,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Anglo-Saxon and German poetry, as well as in Scandinavian and Gothic"
933,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,records. The Wudga and Hama of Widsith (Waldhere and Beowulf) and the
934,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Theodric of Waldhere are clearly identical with the Witege, Heime and"
935,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Dietrich von Bern of the German epics, while Theodric figures also,"
936,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"though not prominently, in the Edda. Of all the Edda poems[12] those"
937,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,which show the least connection with non-Scandinavian poetry are the
938,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"three Helgakviður. Yet Sinfiötli, as well as Sigmundr, is mentioned in"
939,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Beowulf (under the form Fitela) and there are traces that his name was
940,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,once known in Germany.
941,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
942,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,We may observe that in Beowulf it is only the persons mentioned in
943,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,casual references and in episodes lying outside the main action of
944,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"the story, such as Sigemund, Eormenric, Hama and Weland, to whom we"
945,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,find allusions in German poetry. On the other hand most of the chief
946,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"characters of the poem are well known from Scandinavian records,"
947,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,though not in connection with precisely the same incidents. There is
948,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"no doubt as to the identity of the Danish kings Healfdene, his sons"
949,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Hrothgar and Halga, and Hrothwulf the nephew and colleague of Hrothgar,"
950,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"with Halfdan, his sons Hróarr and Helgi and Helgi's son, the famous"
951,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Hrólfr Kraki--all likewise kings of the Danes. Equally obvious is the
952,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,identity of the Swedish prince Eadgils the son of Ohthere with Aðils
953,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"the son of Óttarr in Ynglingatal, while his uncle and opponent Onela"
954,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"is clearly the same person as Aðils' opponent Áli, although the latter"
955,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"is represented as a Norwegian in Old Norse literature. Further, the"
956,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,episode in which Ingeld is incited by an old warrior to avenge his
957,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,father Froda is evidently to be connected with certain poems given by
958,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Saxo, in which the old warrior Starcatherus rouses Ingellus to avenge"
959,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,his father Frotho. Among other persons mentioned in the poem Scyld is
960,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,doubtless to be identified with the Skiöldr of Scandinavian tradition;
961,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,probably also Heremod with the Hermóðr of Hyndlulióð and Weoxtan with
962,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,the Vésteinn of the Kalfsvísa[13]. To the identification of Beowulf
963,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"himself with the Biarki of Scandinavian tradition, which is doubted by"
964,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"some scholars, we shall have to return later."
965,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
966,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,The characters of the Finn fragment are much less easy to trace
967,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,elsewhere. Two of Hnaef's warriors named Ordlaf and Guthlaf are
968,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"probably to be identified with two Danish princes, Oddlevus and"
969,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Gunnlevus, mentioned in Skiöldunga Saga; but there is nothing to show"
970,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,that Sigeferth is identical with Sigurðr the son of Sigmundr. In
971,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Widsith however we find a large number of persons who are well known
972,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"from Continental and Scandinavian authorities. Besides Eormenric,"
973,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Wudga, Hama, Offa, Hrothgar, Hrothwulf and Ingeld, of whom we have"
974,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"already spoken, we hear of Aetla, king of the Huns (Atli, Etzel),"
975,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Guthhere and Gifeca, kings of the Burgundians (i.e. the Gunnarr and"
976,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Giúki of the Edda), and Sigehere, king of the Danes (i.e. probably"
977,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Sigarr, the father of Signý), as well as the Goths Eastgota the father"
978,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"of Unwine (i.e. Jordanes' Ostrogotha the father of Hunwil), Becca"
979,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"(probably Bikki, the evil counsellor of Iörmunrekr) and the Herelingas,"
980,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Emerca and Fridla, who are doubtless to be identified with the"
981,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Embrica and Fritla, nephews of Eormenric, mentioned in the Annals of"
982,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Quedlinburg and elsewhere. It is more than probable also that in v. 21:
983,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"""Hagena ruled the Holmryge and Heoden (MS. _Henden_) the Glommas,"" we"
984,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,have an allusion to the story of Heðinn and Högni (the Hetel and Hagen
985,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,of Kûdrûn). We may compare a passage of Deor (v. 35 ff.) which tells of
986,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"a skilful minstrel of the Heodeningas named Heorrenda, presumably the"
987,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Hôrand of the German poem.
988,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
989,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"These instances, though far from exhaustive, will be sufficient to show"
990,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,that the same characters recur again and again in the early narrative
991,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,poetry of the various Teutonic peoples. In the last nineteen poems of
992,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,the Older Edda (viz. those which deal with human beings) there is but
993,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,one (Helgakviða Hiörvarðssonar) which introduces no characters known
994,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,elsewhere. Among the early Anglo-Saxon poems treated on p. 1 ff. we
995,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"find no such case, and the same is probably true of the German poems"
996,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"discussed on pp. 5, 7 ff. With the later Anglo-Saxon poems (p. 3) and"
997,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,the German historical poems of the ninth and following centuries the
998,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,case is quite otherwise. The exploits of Aethelstan and Byrhtnoth are
999,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"celebrated only in English poems, those of Ludwig III and other German"
1000,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,princes only in the poetry of their own country. So also with the
1001,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,skaldic poems of the North. If these introduce any personal names known
1002,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"in the poetry of England or Germany they are names, like Sigmundr and"
1003,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Hermóðr, derived from earlier poems and not belonging to contemporary"
1004,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,persons. Similarly neither English nor German poetry celebrates the
1005,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,deeds of Eiríkr Blóðöx or Haakon the Good.
1006,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
1007,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,The phenomena noted above seem to indicate that the poetic cycles with
1008,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,which we have been dealing have a common origin or at least that there
1009,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,was a considerable amount of borrowing between poets of different
1010,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,nations. In order however to be able to form an opinion on this point
1011,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,it is necessary first to consider the following questions: (i) how
1012,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,far the characters and incidents of these poems are to be regarded as
1013,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"historical, (ii) to what period or periods of history they belong."
1014,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,We may note in passing that no doubt need be entertained as to the
1015,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"historical basis of the later group of Anglo-Saxon poems, of German"
1016,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,poems such as the Ludwigslied or of the Northern skaldic poems--however
1017,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,much the true facts may be obscured by poetic embellishments.
1018,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
1019,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,It is clear enough that some of the characters of the common cycles
1020,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"are historical persons. Thus there can be no doubt that Aetla (Atli,"
1021,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Etzel), king of the Huns, is the famous Hunnish king Attila who died in"
1022,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"453. Again the Burgundian king Guthhere (Gunnarr, Gunther), who plays"
1023,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"so prominent a part in the stories of Waldhere and Sigurðr-Siegfried,"
1024,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,is clearly identical with the historical Burgundian king Gundicarius
1025,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"(Gundaharius), whose defeat in 435 by the Roman general Aetius is"
1026,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,recorded by contemporary writers. Of his end Prosper says only that the
1027,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Huns destroyed him together with his family and nation[14], and some"
1028,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,scholars have denied that Attila had any part in this event[15]. But
1029,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,our knowledge of the course of events on or beyond the Roman frontier
1030,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,at this period is too slight to justify any confident statement on such
1031,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,a point. Of the other members of the Burgundian royal family Gifeca
1032,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,(Giúki) and Gislhere (Giselher) are mentioned in the laws of King
1033,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Gundobad who died in the year 516[16].
1034,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
1035,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"The Gothic king Eormenric (Hermanaricus, Iörmunrekr) is another"
1036,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,doubtless historical character. The account of him given by Jordanes
1037,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"seems indeed to be derived from tradition, handed down probably in"
1038,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,poetic form; but the statement that he took his own life through fear
1039,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,of the Huns is confirmed by the strictly contemporary writer Ammianus
1040,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Marcellinus (xxxi. 3. 1), from whom we gather that the event took place"
1041,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,shortly after 370. He also states that Eormenric was a most warlike
1042,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,king and feared by the surrounding nations on account of his many brave
1043,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,deeds.
1044,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
1045,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,In Dietrich von Bern (the Theodric of Waldhere and the Thióðrekr of the
1046,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Edda) we certainly have reminiscences of the Ostrogothic king Theodoric
1047,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,who ruled Italy from 489 to 526. The statement in the Hildebrandslied
1048,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,that he fled from the hostility of Ottachar and the story of the
1049,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Rabenschlacht recall his campaigns with Odoacer, which culminated in"
1050,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,the surrender of Ravenna in 493. But it cannot possibly be true that
1051,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"he was present at Attila's court, where we find him in the Edda and in"
1052,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"German poetry, much less that he had any dealings with Eormenric. The"
1053,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,former mistake is generally attributed to confusion between Dietrich
1054,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"and his father Dietmar (Thiudemer), who is known to have been with"
1055,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Attila. The other error however is more difficult to account for and
1056,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,will require to be discussed later.
1057,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
1058,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,It is commonly held that in the poems dealing with Wolfdietrich[17] the
1059,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,hero and his father Hugdietrich represent a confusion of the Frankish
1060,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,kings Theodberht (r. 534-548) and his father Theodric I (r. 511-534).
1061,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,In this case however it must be confessed that the resemblances are
1062,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,extremely slight. The application of the name Hugo Theodoricus to
1063,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Theodric I in the Annals of Quedlinburg cannot at best prove more than
1064,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,that the chronicler identified the two.
1065,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
1066,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,The identification of characters which figure in stories relating to
1067,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"the northern kingdoms is naturally more difficult, since references to"
1068,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,such persons by contemporary Roman historians are extremely rare. One
1069,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"safe instance however is furnished by the incident, referred to several"
1070,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"times in Beowulf, of Hygelac's disastrous expedition against the Franks"
1071,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,and Frisians. Gregory of Tours (III 3) and the Gesta Francorum (cap.
1072,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,19) mention a very serious raid on the lower Rhine by a king of the
1073,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Danes named Chocilaicus, which ended in his defeat and death through"
1074,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"the arrival of an army under Theodberht. The Liber Monstrorum (I, cap."
1075,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"3[18]), a work of perhaps the seventh century, states that the bones of"
1076,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"a certain _Getarum rex Huiglaucus_, who had been slain by the Franks,"
1077,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,were preserved on an island at the mouth of the Rhine. There can be no
1078,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,question that the person referred to in these passages is the Hygelac
1079,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"of Beowulf. The date of the expedition, though not precisely fixed by"
1080,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"any authority, may safely be placed within a few years of 520."
1081,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
1082,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Most of the Danish and Swedish princes common to Beowulf and the
1083,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Northern authorities are now generally regarded as historical
1084,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"characters, though we have no reference to them in contemporary"
1085,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,documents. It is to be noted in the first place that though the persons
1086,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"themselves are common to the two traditions, English and Northern, they"
1087,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,are not as a rule mentioned in connection with the same incidents.
1088,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Further, there is no evidence for communication between England and"
1089,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,the Baltic during the seventh and eighth centuries. This renders it
1090,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,probable that the two records go back independently to a time at which
1091,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,persons who remembered Hygelac's younger contemporaries might still be
1092,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,alive.
1093,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
1094,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Lastly a few words must be said with regard to the stories of Haraldr
1095,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Hilditönn, Sigurðr Hringr and Ragnarr Loðbrók. The sons of Loðbrók"
1096,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,are well known from contemporary historical documents through their
1097,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"piratical expeditions, more especially the great invasion of England in"
1098,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"866. Moreover, though the references to Loðbrók himself are rare and"
1099,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"doubtful, it is clear enough that the king Ella who is said to have"
1100,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"put him to death was the Northumbrian usurper Aella, who reigned from"
1101,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,863 to 867. Loðbrók's father Sigurðr Hringr has been identified with a
1102,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,certain Sigifridus whose conflict with another Danish king named Anulo
1103,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"is recorded in a number of Latin chronicles under the year 812, and"
1104,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Anulo himself with that Óli who is represented as Sigurðr's ally at the
1105,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"battle of Brávík. Lastly, it has been suggested that a reference to"
1106,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Haraldr Hilditönn may quite possibly be preserved in the description of
1107,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Anulo as _nepos Herioldi quondam regis_[19]; for according to Saxo (p.
1108,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,250) Óli was the son of Haraldr's sister and eventually succeeded him
1109,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,on the Danish throne.
1110,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
1111,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,The above identifications[20] are sufficient to show that historical
1112,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,characters are introduced into most of the stories with which we have
1113,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,been dealing. Further--and this is a very remarkable fact--apart from
1114,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"the last cycles embracing Haraldr Hilditönn and Ragnarr Loðbrók, which"
1115,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"are entirely confined to Northern literature, all the historical"
1116,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,personages whom we have been able to identify belong to a period
1117,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,extending over barely two centuries. Eormenric flourished in the latter
1118,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"half of the fourth century, Attila and the Burgundian kings in the"
1119,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,first half of the fifth; Theodric towards the end of the same century
1120,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,and in the first quarter of the sixth. Hygelac again was a contemporary
1121,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"of Theodric; while Wolfdietrich, if he is rightly identified with"
1122,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Theodberht, died in 548. In the stories which form the common themes of"
1123,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"English, German and Scandinavian poets we find no mention of historical"
1124,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,persons who lived after the middle of the sixth century.
1125,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
1126,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Now it will be clear that the cycles of stories dealing with Ragnarr
1127,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Loðbrók and his ancestors are really, like the skaldic poems, to"
1128,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,be compared with German and English works such as the Ludwigslied
1129,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,and the poem on the battle of Brunanburh. The difference in tone is
1130,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"sufficiently accounted for by the social conditions of the Viking Age,"
1131,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,which were wholly different from those which prevailed in the Christian
1132,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,kingdoms.
1133,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
1134,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,The statement that the common cycles of tradition mention no historical
1135,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,characters later than about 550 ought perhaps to be qualified in one
1136,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,case. Paulus Diaconus (_Hist. Lang._ I 27) says that the praises of
1137,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Alboin, king of the Langobardi, who died in 572 (or 573), were sung"
1138,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"by the Saxons, Bavarians and other peoples; and it has been suggested"
1139,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,that his account of certain incidents in Alboin's career is derived
1140,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"from poetic sources. Further, we find the generosity of the same king"
1141,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"celebrated in the Anglo-Saxon poem Widsith, where he is apparently the"
1142,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,latest person mentioned. Hence there is some ground for including him
1143,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,among the characters of common Teutonic poetry--which will involve our
1144,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,extending the lower of the chronological limits fixed above by about
1145,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,twenty years. Yet it is not clear that Alboin figured in any poems
1146,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"which can properly be called narrative, except perhaps among his own"
1147,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,people.
1148,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
1149,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"On the other hand some of the Gothic heroes recorded by Jordanes,"
1150,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"if we are to trust his chronology at all, must be referred to times"
1151,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,long anterior to the middle of the fourth century. Apart from Gothic
1152,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,tradition the only mention of any of these persons occurs in a brief
1153,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"passage in Widsith (v. 113 f.): ""(I have visited) Eastgota, the wise"
1154,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"and good father of Unwine."" Now Ostrogotha is brought by Jordanes into"
1155,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,connection with the Emperor Philip (v. 244-249). He is mentioned also
1156,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,by Cassiodorus (_Var._ XI 1) as one of the ancestors of Amalasuintha
1157,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,and as a prince renowned for forbearance (_patientia_). In spite of his
1158,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,suspicious name what is said of him by Jordanes seems to point to a
1159,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"genuine tradition. But if so, even setting aside both the reference to"
1160,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Philip and the genealogy given by Jordanes in cap. 5, he is probably to"
1161,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,be referred to a time anterior to the upper limit fixed above. Into the
1162,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"story of Filimer and the migration we need not enter, as there is no"
1163,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,reason for supposing it to be anything but a purely Gothic tradition.
1164,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,The story of the Langobardic victory over the Vandals (cf. p. 10) is
1165,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,probably of a similar character.
1166,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
1167,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,There remain of course a number of stories which contain no names
1168,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,of persons mentioned in contemporary records. The story of Finn is
1169,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"in Beowulf connected, rather loosely, with Healfdene, Hrothgar's"
1170,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,father. Hence if the incidents which it relates are to be regarded as
1171,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"historical, they must be dated somewhat earlier, though certainly not"
1172,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"more than a century earlier, than Hygelac's expedition. The story of"
1173,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Offa and his father Wermund must be referred to a still earlier period
1174,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,if we are to trust the evidence of the Mercian genealogy in which these
1175,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"persons figure. I have tried elsewhere[21] to show that the Athislus,"
1176,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"who in Saxo's version of the story appears as Wermund's enemy, is"
1177,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,probably to be identified with the Eadgils prince of the Myrgingas
1178,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,mentioned in Widsith. The latter is represented as the contemporary of
1179,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Eormenric, and the date thus obtained agrees with that given by the"
1180,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"genealogy. The story of Weland, if it contains any historical element,"
1181,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"should be placed perhaps slightly further back; for in Waldhere, as"
1182,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"well as in many German authorities, including Thiðreks Saga, Weland is"
1183,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"said to be the father of Widia (Wudga, Witege). The latter is often"
1184,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"associated with Eormenric[22], and there can be little doubt that he is"
1185,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,to be identified with the Gothic Vidigoia who is mentioned as a hero
1186,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,of the past by Jordanes (cap. 34) in a quotation from Priscus[23]. For
1187,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,the story of Hagbarðr and Signý a date is afforded by a poem attributed
1188,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"by Saxo (p. 214) to Starkaðr. The poet, who in his old age served"
1189,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Ingellus, i.e. Ingeld, the son-in-law of Hrothgar, says that he had"
1190,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"followed Haki, the brother of Hagbarðr, in his early youth. In Ynglinga"
1191,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Saga (cap. 23) Haki is made to fight with the Swedish king Iörundr,"
1192,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"four generations above Aðils, but this genealogy cannot be entirely"
1193,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,correct.
1194,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
1195,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,The only important stories which remain are those of Fróði the Peaceful
1196,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,and Heðinn and Högni. In Saxo's history (p. 158 ff.) the two are
1197,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"brought into connection with one another, and it is certainly to be"
1198,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,noted that a Fruote von Tenemarke plays rather a prominent part in
1199,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Kûdrûn, especially the first portion. But Fróði is associated with"
1200,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"different sets of persons in different works, and his resemblance"
1201,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,to the god Frey rather suggests that he was regarded as the typical
1202,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,representative of a Golden Age in the past. The story of Heðinn and
1203,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Högni is very difficult to locate, both in regard to time and scene."
1204,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Widsith however, which is our earliest authority for it, represents"
1205,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Hagena (Högni) as king of the Holmryge, who appear to have dwelt in"
1206,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,eastern Pomerania. Since the whole of the south coast of the Baltic had
1207,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"probably become Slavonic by the end of the fifth century, it is at all"
1208,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,events unlikely that the story refers to any period after this.
1209,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
1210,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,We shall have to discuss later how far these stories are to be regarded
1211,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,as historical and to what extent the characters and incidents with
1212,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,which they deal are to be attributed to myth or fiction. Here it is
1213,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,sufficient to point out that with the exception of the story of Heðinn
1214,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"and Högni, the connections of which are obscure, all the stories"
1215,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,which we have just been discussing are referred by our authorities to
1216,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,generations anterior to the characters of Beowulf. Hence we may safely
1217,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,conclude that the period embraced by the common poetry and traditions
1218,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,of the various Teutonic peoples--what we may call the Heroic Age of
1219,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,these peoples--had come to an end by the middle of the sixth century or
1220,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,at least by the death of Alboin. Its upper limit must in view of the
1221,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,evidence given above be set from two to three centuries back--probably
1222,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,three centuries if we include the story of Ostrogotha.
1223,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
1224,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,These limitations are clearly such as to call for some attempt at
1225,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,explanation. Why do the cycles of story which are common to the various
1226,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Teutonic peoples mention no historical character later than Alboin?
1227,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Before we can hope to give a satisfactory answer to this question, a"
1228,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,number of other phenomena will have to be taken into account. One or
1229,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,two observations however will not be out of place here.
1230,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
1231,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,The period extending backwards from two to three centuries before the
1232,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,reign of Alboin coincides with what is generally known as the Age of
1233,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,National Migrations (Völkerwanderungszeit). It was during this period
1234,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,that many of the Teutonic nations broke through the frontiers of the
1235,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Roman empire and carved out for themselves extensive kingdoms within
1236,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"its territories. Among these were the realms of Guthhere and Theodric,"
1237,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,and in part also that of Attila. There is no doubt that in all these
1238,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,cases the conquest of the Roman provinces brought with it a great
1239,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,accession of wealth and profoundly affected the life of the invaders.
1240,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
1241,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,The same period witnessed the conversion of most of the continental
1242,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Teutonic peoples to Christianity, another change which produced"
1243,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,far-reaching effects upon them. Yet it is not clear at first sight
1244,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,how this change is connected with the chronological limitation of the
1245,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"stories, for while some of the chief characters, Attila for instance"
1246,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"and doubtless Eormenric, were heathens, others such as Theodric were"
1247,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,certainly Christians. The change of faith is not a motive which plays
1248,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,any part in the stories themselves.
1249,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
1250,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"Whatever weight we may be disposed to attach to these observations,"
1251,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,it should be noted that they do not seem to apply to every case. Thus
1252,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,we shall see in the course of the next chapter that Danish characters
1253,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"figure more prominently than those of any other nation, not only"
1254,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"in Scandinavian but also in English records, throughout the period"
1255,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"ending with Hrólfr Kraki. Yet the Danes took no part, collectively at"
1256,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"least, in the movements against the Roman Empire, nor did Christianity"
1257,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,penetrate to them before the ninth century. It is worth remarking
1258,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"therefore that stories relating to Denmark stop where they do, and that"
1259,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,for centuries after the time of Hrólfr we can scarcely give the name of
1260,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,a single Danish prince.
1261,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,
1262,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,In the following chapters it will be convenient to speak of the period
1263,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,which we have been discussing simply as the Heroic Age. The term
1264,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"'heroic poetry,' as a translation of Heldendichtung or Heltedigtning,"
1265,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,may of course be applied in a sense to such works as Hákonarmál or
1266,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"the poem on the battle of Maldon, just as well as to Beowulf or the"
1267,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,Hildebrandslied. But no ambiguity will arise if we limit the term
1268,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,'heroic' here to what may be called the 'Teutonic' Heroic Age (das
1269,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,"germanische Heldenalter), i.e. to the period embraced by the common"
1270,THE HEROIC AGE OF THE TEUTONIC PEOPLES.,poetry and traditions of the various Teutonic peoples.

1331,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
1332,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
1333,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,In the last chapter it was pointed out that the age covered by the
1334,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,heroic poetry and traditions of the Teutonic peoples coincides with a
1335,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"clearly marked period of history, extending over about two or possibly"
1336,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"three hundred years, and coming to an end in the latter half of the"
1337,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,sixth century. Something must now be said regarding the geographical
1338,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,and ethnographical limitations of the stories--the localities in
1339,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,which the scenes are laid and the nationalities to which the various
1340,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,characters belonged. The scenes are distributed over a considerable
1341,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"part of Europe, extending from Italy to Sweden and from western Russia"
1342,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,to the Vosges and the Netherlands. The British Isles however seem to
1343,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"have lain outside the area, though in the late form in which some of"
1344,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"the stories have come down to us, we do occasionally find references"
1345,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,to them--generally to Scotland or Ireland--which are probably due to
1346,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,confusion with stories of the Viking Age. Indeed it is remarkable that
1347,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the early Anglo-Saxon poems contain no reference to persons or events
1348,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"connected with this country. Further, except possibly in the case of"
1349,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"the story of Hengest and Horsa, we have no evidence worth consideration"
1350,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,that poems dealing with such subjects ever existed. Norway also is
1351,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"not made the scene of any of the main stories, though it is mentioned"
1352,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,incidentally in English and German as well as Scandinavian poems.
1353,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"The Balkan peninsula figures only in the later German poems, while"
1354,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,references to places in Italy are limited practically to the Dietrich
1355,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,(Theodric) and Wolfdietrich cycles.
1356,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
1357,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Turning to the question of nationality we find the following peoples
1358,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"represented: (i) to the Goths belong Eormenric, Theodric, Wudga"
1359,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,(Witege) and probably most of the heroes associated with them; (ii)
1360,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,to the Huns Attila; (iii) to the Burgundians Guthhere and his family;
1361,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"(iv) to the Rugii apparently Hagena (Högni), the father of Hild; (v)"
1362,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"to the Franks Hugdietrich and Wolfdietrich, if the identifications are"
1363,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,correct; (vi) to the Frisians Finn; (vii) to the Angli Wermund and
1364,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Offa; (viii) to the Danes (_a_) Fróði the Peaceful, (_b_) Sigarr and"
1365,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"his family, together probably with Hagbarðr and Haki, (_c_) Hrólfr"
1366,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Kraki and his family, perhaps also Froda (Frotho IV) and Ingeld; (ix)"
1367,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"to the Götar Hygelac, Beowulf and their relatives; (x) to the Swedes"
1368,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,(Svear) Aðils and his family.
1369,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
1370,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,It is somewhat remarkable that we have no stories dealing with
1371,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Alamannic or Bavarian heroes, since the German poems which have come"
1372,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,down to us are almost entirely derived from the territories of these
1373,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"peoples[24]. The Vandals too are unrepresented, and probably also the"
1374,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Visigoths, while the evidence for Frankish heroes is slight and rather"
1375,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,unsatisfactory. Frankish nationality is claimed by most scholars for
1376,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Siegfried, chiefly on the ground that Xanten is represented as his home"
1377,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"in the Nibelungenlied[25]. Yet he is never called a Frank, and it is"
1378,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,not clear that Xanten was in the possession of the Franks at the time
1379,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,to which the story refers. The same nationality may perhaps be claimed
1380,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"for Waldhere. In several German poems Langres is said to be his home,"
1381,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"though he is also called a Spaniard, while Ekkehard makes his father"
1382,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,king of Aquitaine[26]. To this question we shall have to return later.
1383,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,In any case both stories refer to a period considerably anterior to the
1384,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"real conquest of Gaul by the Franks, and it is certainly a curious fact"
1385,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,that Clovis and his great achievements seem to be entirely unnoticed in
1386,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,poetry.
1387,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
1388,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,It appears then that though most of the principal Teutonic nations are
1389,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,represented in our stories the relative prominence assigned to them
1390,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,does not at all correspond to what we should expect. Most remarkable is
1391,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the fact that in stories relating to the Continent nearly all the chief
1392,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"characters (Eormenric, Theodric, Guthhere, Attila, etc.) belong to"
1393,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,nations which had passed out of existence before the end of the sixth
1394,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,century. From Jordanes (cap. 5) we gather that the preservation of the
1395,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,early Gothic traditions was very largely due to the pride taken by that
1396,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,people in its own heroes of the past. Yet it is not easy to see how the
1397,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,survival of the stories which have come down to us can be ascribed to
1398,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,any such feeling.
1399,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
1400,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Let us first examine the Anglo-Saxon poems. In Beowulf the scene is
1401,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,laid first in the land of the Danes and later in that of the Götar. The
1402,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"hero himself belongs to the latter nation, but in the earlier part of"
1403,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the poem the former are decidedly the more prominent. Taking it as a
1404,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,whole the interest is divided between the royal families of these two
1405,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,nations; the only other dynasty which comes in for any considerable
1406,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,share of attention is that of the Swedes. In the story of Finn the
1407,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,interest is centred in a prince and his followers who according to
1408,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Beowulf were of Danish nationality and involved in hostilities with the
1409,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Frisians. In Waldhere the hero and heroine, whatever their nationality,"
1410,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"belong to Gaul, while their opponents are Burgundians. In Deor the"
1411,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"interests are mainly, perhaps exclusively, Gothic. In Widsith the"
1412,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"foremost characters are Eadgils, prince of the Myrgingas (a dynasty"
1413,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"hostile to the Angli), and the Gothic king Eormenric; after them the"
1414,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"English king Offa, the Danish kings Hrothgar and Hrothwulf, Guthhere,"
1415,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"king of the Burgundians, Aelfwine (Alboin, king of the Langobardi) and"
1416,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"several Gothic heroes. In all these poems there is no reference, as far"
1417,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"as we know, to any person of English nationality except Offa and his"
1418,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"relatives (Beow. 1944 ff.), nor except in Widsith is the name of the"
1419,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Angli even mentioned.
1420,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
1421,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"If we turn now to the Scandinavian records, which are entirely"
1422,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Norse (Norwegian-Icelandic), so far as the vernacular literature is"
1423,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"concerned, the phenomena which confront us are on the whole very"
1424,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,similar. As we might expect from the comparative lateness of our
1425,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,authorities the nationality of the various characters is not very
1426,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,clearly indicated. It is remembered that Atli (Attila) belonged to the
1427,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Huns and Iörmunrekr (Eormenric) to the Goths, but Gunnarr (Guthhere)"
1428,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"is only once called lord of the Burgundians. As for Sigurðr, his later"
1429,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"adventures are uniformly located in the Rhineland, but the history"
1430,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"of his family is generally connected with Denmark, which is also the"
1431,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,scene of Helgi's exploits. Most noteworthy however is the fact that
1432,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Norway is only mentioned once in the Older Edda, namely in the prose of"
1433,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Helgakviða Hiörvarðssonar. In the sagas it is somewhat more prominent,"
1434,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,e.g. in the account of Biarki's origin in Hrólfs Saga Kraka; but these
1435,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,passages are usually regarded as accretions to the original stories.
1436,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Of course there are numerous other sagas which deal exclusively with
1437,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Norwegian history and legend. These stories however are peculiar to
1438,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Norwegian-Icelandic literature, and the earliest persons who figure in"
1439,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"them, if we may regard them as historical, cannot have lived before"
1440,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the seventh century. In stories relating to earlier times the scene is
1441,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,practically always laid in Denmark or southern Sweden or in the lands
1442,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,south of the Baltic.
1443,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
1444,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Even in the German poems national feeling has influenced the choice
1445,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,of subjects comparatively little. The poems in their present form are
1446,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,mainly Austrian or Bavarian. Yet except in the second half of the
1447,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Nibelungenlied this region does not figure prominently[27], and even"
1448,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,there the Bavarian characters that occur are generally believed to
1449,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,be rather late additions to the story. The chief characters of the
1450,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"story in its original form were clearly Burgundians and Huns, to whom"
1451,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the Goths may have been added at a fairly early date. The stories
1452,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,which deal with the Rhineland--those of Siegfried and Walther--may
1453,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,be derived ultimately from early Frankish poems; but this cannot be
1454,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"proved. Most of the others are concerned with Gothic heroes, the true"
1455,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"scene of whose adventures is to be sought in Poland, Hungary, Italy"
1456,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,and other countries which had ceased to be Teutonic before the time of
1457,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"our authorities. Theodric, it is true, seems to have become a national"
1458,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"hero in the south-east, but this feature is prominent only in the"
1459,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"latest poems, and even here it is clearly remembered that he belonged"
1460,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,to Italy. But the most remarkable case is that of Kûdrûn. The poem
1461,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"itself is probably Austrian, but the names which it contains show that"
1462,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the story is derived from Frisian sources. The scene is laid first in
1463,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Ireland, then in Denmark and lastly in Normandy. Yet if we take into"
1464,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,account the various Scandinavian versions and the references to the
1465,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"story in Anglo-Saxon poetry, there is every probability that it came"
1466,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,originally from the Baltic.
1467,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
1468,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,This short discussion will suffice to show how singularly free the
1469,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,poems we have been discussing are from anything in the nature of
1470,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,national interest or sentiment. They are certainly national in the
1471,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"sense that the characters are drawn entirely, or almost entirely, from"
1472,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,within the Teutonic world--for even Attila can hardly be regarded as an
1473,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"exception. But nationalism in the narrower sense, i.e. in the interests"
1474,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"of the poet's own nation or tribe, seems to be altogether wanting. The"
1475,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,interest is centred in one or more individual characters and in the
1476,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"various adventures that befall them. Sometimes, as in Beowulf, it does"
1477,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"also embrace the history of the family to which these persons belonged,"
1478,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"but the nation, apart from the royal family, is practically disregarded."
1479,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
1480,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,The contrast afforded by the historical poems of the ninth and tenth
1481,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"centuries[28] is sufficiently obvious. We have seen that these poems,"
1482,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"whether English or German, uniformly deal with the poet's own nation."
1483,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,The poem on the battle of Brunanburh is an expression of national
1484,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,triumph. It is not concerned with the personal adventures of the king
1485,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"or his brother, but with the prowess of the English army as a whole."
1486,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"The bravery of the princes is certainly noticed, but they appear to"
1487,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,be regarded as the champions and representatives of the nation. The
1488,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Ludwigslied breathes on the whole a similar spirit, in spite of its"
1489,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,strongly religious tone. Even in the skaldic poetry of the North traces
1490,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"of national pride are clearly discernible, as in Hákonarmál (v. 3),"
1491,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"where Haakon, at the head of his Norwegian troops, is described as the"
1492,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,terror of the Danes.
1493,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
1494,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"It may perhaps be urged that, though the poems which have come down to"
1495,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"us have no national interest, they may be derived from older poems"
1496,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,which originated in the hero's own land. Thus many scholars believe
1497,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Beowulf to be of Scandinavian origin in one sense or another, though"
1498,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the linguistic arguments which have been brought forward in favour of
1499,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,this view are not generally admitted. But there is a curious lack of
1500,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"uniformity in the national interests of the poem, as we have already"
1501,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,seen. If it had been the chief intention of the original poet to
1502,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"glorify the Danish nation, he would not have ignored it as he has done"
1503,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,in the latter part of the poem. On the other hand if his intention
1504,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,was to glorify the Götar he would hardly have begun with an account
1505,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,of the early kings of the Danes. The difficulty has been got over by
1506,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"supposing that the poem as we have it is of composite formation, and it"
1507,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,may very well be that the second part of the poem is a later addition.
1508,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,But it is to be observed that somewhat similar phenomena occur in other
1509,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,cases. Thus the stories of Siegfried and Attila are connected both in
1510,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"the Nibelungenlied and the Edda, and there can be no doubt that the"
1511,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,connection is of considerable antiquity. Yet the only common element
1512,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"in the two stories is supplied by the Burgundians, and the portraiture"
1513,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"of their princes, especially that of the king, is hardly of such a"
1514,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,character as to suggest its derivation from a poem composed for the
1515,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,glorification of the Burgundian nation.
1516,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
1517,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,The evidence then of Beowulf alone is scarcely sufficient to justify
1518,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,us in assuming more than that its author or authors were interested in
1519,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"the royal families of the North, and that they possessed a considerable"
1520,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,amount of information regarding them. The account of the early kings of
1521,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the Danes seems to be in the nature of a tribal or family tradition--to
1522,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"be compared with the early stories given by Jordanes, Paulus Diaconus"
1523,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,and Widukind. Traditions of this kind are no doubt generally of a
1524,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"mythical character, and consequently their origin is to be sought in"
1525,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the particular locality or family with which they are concerned. We
1526,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,have no evidence that such traditions formed the main theme of stories
1527,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,which were common to the poetry of the various Teutonic peoples. But
1528,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,it is natural enough that a poet who was well acquainted with some
1529,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"royal family, whether that of his own nation or not, would also know"
1530,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"its traditions, and that he would utilise them incidentally or by way"
1531,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,of introduction in a poem largely concerned with the fortunes of that
1532,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,family.
1533,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
1534,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,The main story of the poem stands on a different footing. Of course if
1535,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,it could be shown that the Danish princes who figure both in Beowulf
1536,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"and the various Scandinavian records were fictitious persons, who never"
1537,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"really existed, we should be bound to hold that they were derived from"
1538,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"a common story, probably of Scandinavian origin. But few scholars would"
1539,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"now be willing to admit such a proposition. Certain incidents, such as"
1540,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"the exhortation of Ingeld (Ingellus) by the old warrior (Starcatherus),"
1541,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,may be held to point to a common origin in poem or saga; but most of
1542,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the events narrated appear to have been either preserved by memory or
1543,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,invented independently.
1544,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
1545,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,With the stories of Sigurðr (Siegfried) and Waldhere the case is
1546,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,somewhat different. It is the opinion of the great majority of scholars
1547,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"that both these heroes are mythical or fictitious, in spite of the"
1548,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,fact that they are associated with undoubtedly historical characters.
1549,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,If this view is correct--a question which we shall have to discuss
1550,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,later--we may conclude at once that the different versions of the two
1551,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"stories, Scandinavian and German in the one case, English and German in"
1552,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"the other, have sprung from a common source, whether in poem or saga."
1553,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"But even if we take the opposite view, viz. that Sigurðr and Waldhere"
1554,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"were real persons and that their adventures are founded on fact, it"
1555,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,does not by any means follow that the different versions of their
1556,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,stories must have originated independently. Neither hero seems to have
1557,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"belonged to a family of outstanding position, nor were their exploits"
1558,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,such as to influence the destiny of nations.[29] In the age of Hunnish
1559,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,supremacy scores of petty princes must have undergone somewhat similar
1560,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,adventures and distinguished themselves by similar deeds of heroism.
1561,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Hence it can hardly be due to accident that the handful whose names we
1562,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,know were celebrated far and wide in the Teutonic world.
1563,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
1564,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,The story of Eormenric is again rather a different case. There can be
1565,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"no question that this king was a historical person, but the earliest"
1566,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"detailed account which we possess of his doings, viz. that given by"
1567,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Jordanes, dates from nearly two centuries after his death. Now we find"
1568,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"what is perhaps the most striking episode in Eormenric's story, namely"
1569,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"the account of Swanhild and the vengeance attempted by her brothers,"
1570,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,both in Jordanes and the Older Edda (Guðrúnarhvöt and Hamðismál) with
1571,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,comparatively slight variations. The chief feature wanting in Jordanes'
1572,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,account is supplied by the Annals of Quedlinburg.[30] How much truth
1573,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the story contains we are not in a position to decide. But even if
1574,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"we grant that the main features are historical, the event can hardly"
1575,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"have been of the first importance, since the attack seems really to"
1576,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,have failed in its object. Ammianus Marcellinus says that Eormenric
1577,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"committed suicide owing to despair at the impending Hunnish invasion,"
1578,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,and Jordanes recognises that his death was partly due to this cause.
1579,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,But in the later (Scandinavian and German) accounts it is entirely
1580,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,forgotten. Hence if we bear in mind the close agreement between the
1581,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Gothic and Scandinavian versions of the story, not only in the names"
1582,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"of the characters but also in the description of Swanhild's death, we"
1583,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,can hardly help inferring that they are derived from a common narrative
1584,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,source.
1585,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
1586,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,In conclusion mention may be made of a story which appears to be
1587,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"definitely at variance with historical truth, namely the account of"
1588,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Attila's death given in the Edda poems Atlakviða and Atlamál. It is
1589,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,there stated that Attila was murdered with his two children by his wife
1590,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Guðrún in revenge for her brothers (Gunnarr and Högni), whom he had"
1591,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,treacherously put to death. Now Jordanes (cap. 49) says that Attila
1592,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,died from the bursting of a blood-vessel on the night of his marriage
1593,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"with a girl named Ildico. As his account is derived from Priscus, a"
1594,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"contemporary and trustworthy writer, there can be little doubt that"
1595,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,it is correct. Yet it should be observed that the Roman chronicler
1596,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Marcellinus Comes, who wrote apparently a few years before Jordanes,"
1597,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,says that Attila died by the hand of a woman.[31] The account given in
1598,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"the Edda therefore is no invention of an Icelandic or Norwegian poet,"
1599,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,but founded on a story which was current among the Romans within a
1600,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,century after Attila's death. Indeed considering the circumstances it
1601,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,is by no means unlikely that the story originated immediately after the
1602,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,event.
1603,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
1604,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,These examples will be sufficient to show that the subjects of many
1605,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,of our poems are derived from stories which passed from one Teutonic
1606,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"people to another and some of which were of great antiquity. Further,"
1607,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,it is a proof of the popularity of these stories that they were
1608,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"preserved until comparatively late in the Middle Ages, in spite of"
1609,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the fact that they did not appeal to national interests. The question
1610,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,how they were preserved and transmitted is one which we shall have to
1611,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,discuss in the following chapters. We may note at once however that the
1612,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"most obvious means of preservation, namely by means of writing, was"
1613,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,almost certainly not used to any great extent. Had that been the case
1614,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the divergencies between the different versions of the stories would
1615,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"be far less noticeable than they are. Even in the case of Waldhere,"
1616,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"which shows probably the least amount of variation, the Anglo-Saxon"
1617,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,fragments show a treatment of the subject totally different from that
1618,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"which appears in Ekkehard's poem. Again, there is no evidence that"
1619,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"the Roman alphabet was used in the North, except possibly by a few"
1620,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"foreigners here and there, before the end of the tenth century, while"
1621,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"the Runic alphabet, though it had been known for many centuries, seems"
1622,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,not to have been employed for literary purposes until very late times.
1623,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"But, as we have already mentioned, some of the Edda poems date probably"
1624,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"from the ninth century, and the story of Heðinn and Högni is used by"
1625,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the poet Bragi who lived apparently in the early part of that century.
1626,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,On the Continent of course the case is somewhat different. We have
1627,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,seen that Charlemagne did have a number of ancient poems written down;
1628,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,but there is nothing to show that his collection had any permanent
1629,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,influence. When the Quedlinburg annalist or his authority quotes the
1630,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"heroic stories, perhaps some two centuries later, he refers not to any"
1631,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,written works but to songs formerly current among the country people.
1632,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"It is doubtless by oral tradition therefore, whether in verse or prose,"
1633,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,that the stories of the Heroic Age have mainly been preserved.
1634,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
1635,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,There can be no question that a large number of similar stories
1636,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,have perished. A glance through the catalogues of Widsith will show
1637,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"many names which otherwise are entirely unknown to us, and also an"
1638,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,appreciable number which are not mentioned elsewhere in Anglo-Saxon
1639,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"literature, though they figure in German and Scandinavian records. It"
1640,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,would scarcely be wise however to assume that all the stories of the
1641,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Heroic Age were common Teutonic property. Thus we have no evidence
1642,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"for the story of Waldhere in the North[32], while stories dealing"
1643,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,with Danish heroes seem to have been little known in Germany. The
1644,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,latter observation deserves notice all the more in view of the obvious
1645,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,popularity of such stories in England--a fact proved not merely by
1646,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Beowulf and Finn, but still more by the prominence assigned to Danish"
1647,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,characters in Widsith.
1648,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
1649,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,It will be convenient now to summarise briefly the results of our
1650,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,discussion. We have seen that the scenes of the heroic stories are
1651,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,distributed over most of the lands formerly occupied by the Teutonic
1652,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"peoples. Norway and England however, as well as the distant kingdoms"
1653,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"of the Visigoths and Vandals, seem to lie outside the area. The heroes"
1654,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"also are drawn from many nations, though not in the proportion which"
1655,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"we should expect. Thus the Frankish nation, which ultimately became"
1656,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"dominant, is but poorly represented, while the most prominent places"
1657,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"are taken by peoples such as the Ostrogoths and Burgundians, which lost"
1658,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,their nationality in the course of the sixth century.
1659,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
1660,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,We have further seen that a very large proportion of the characters of
1661,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"the heroic stories figure in the literature of two or more nations, and"
1662,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,that frequently the same stories are told of them. In the latter case
1663,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"it is probable, indeed often practically certain, that the different"
1664,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,versions of the story are ultimately derived from a common narrative.
1665,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"On the other hand, where the same characters are known but only in"
1666,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"connection with different events, such derivation can be proved only"
1667,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,if it can be shown that the characters themselves are fictitious. This
1668,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,remark applies especially to a number of characters common to Beowulf
1669,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,and Scandinavian stories relating to Hrólfr Kraki and his times.
1670,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
1671,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,It is fully in accord with these facts that the heroic poems are not
1672,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,concerned at all--or at least only to a very slight degree--with local
1673,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,or tribal interests. Their tone indeed may be described as in a sense
1674,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"international, though with the restriction that characters and scenes"
1675,SCENE AND NATIONALITY IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,alike are drawn exclusively from within the Teutonic world.

1729,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,not to the poems of the heathen. What has Ingeld to do with Christ?
1730,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,Strait is the house; it will not be able to hold them both. The king
1731,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,of heaven will have no part with so-called kings who are heathen and
1732,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"damned; for the one king reigns eternally in heaven, the other, the"
1733,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"heathen, is damned and groans in hell. In your houses the voices of"
1734,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"those who read should be heard, not a rabble of those who make merry"
1735,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"in the streets[33]."" From this passage it is clear that at the end of"
1736,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the eighth century there were current in Northumbria certain poems,"
1737,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"probably well known poems, dealing with a heathen king named Ingeld,"
1738,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"whom we need not hesitate to identify with Ingeld the son of Froda,"
1739,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,who figures in Beowulf. Of course it is not at all likely that the
1740,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"reference is to Beowulf itself, for the part played by Ingeld in that"
1741,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,poem is insignificant.
1742,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
1743,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,Acquaintance with the subjects of the heroic poems is shown also by a
1744,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"mistake in the Historia Brittonum, 31, which dates probably from about"
1745,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the same period. This passage contains a genealogy, tracing the descent"
1746,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,of Hengest and Horsa from Woden and of Woden from Geat. The latter part
1747,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"is known also from many other texts, in which it regularly runs as"
1748,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"follows: _Woden Frealafing, Frealaf Frithuwulfing, Frithuwulf Finning,"
1749,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Finn Godwulfing, Godwulf Geating_. In the Historia Brittonum however"
1750,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,in place of _Finn Godwulfing_ we find _Finn qui fuit Folcwald_--which
1751,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,is clearly due to confusion with Finn the son of Folcwalda (_Finn
1752,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Folcwalding_), a Frisian king mentioned in Beowulf and Widsith, as well"
1753,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,as in the fragment which bears his name.
1754,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
1755,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,Further evidence is afforded by names of persons and places. There
1756,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,can be no doubt that even in the seventh century it was customary to
1757,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"take the names of famous men of the past or present. Danihel, bishop"
1758,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"of Winchester (d. 745), and Iohannes, bishop of Hexham (d. 721), are"
1759,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,instances which no one will dispute. In the Durham Liber Vitae we meet
1760,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,with the names Aethan and Cundigeorn. It must not be assumed that
1761,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,persons bearing such names were necessarily of Celtic blood. Indeed the
1762,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,spelling suggests rather that they were Englishmen called after Aidan
1763,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"and Kentigern. Deusdedit, archbishop of Canterbury (655-664), doubtless"
1764,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"derived his name from Pope Deusdedit (615-618), while the West Saxon"
1765,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,king Ceadwalla (685-688) was in all probability called after the
1766,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"British king of the same name, who died in 642. It is extremely likely"
1767,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"that Hlothhere, king of Kent (673-685), obtained his name from one of"
1768,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the Frankish kings, Lothair II (584-628) or Lothair III (656-670), for"
1769,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,the element _hloth-_ is not used elsewhere in Anglo-Saxon names. Even
1770,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,in the sixth century we hear of English princes who seem to be called
1771,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"after Frankish or Gothic kings of the same period. Thus Tytla, the name"
1772,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"of the father of the East Anglian king Redwald, is probably taken from"
1773,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,the Gothic king Totila; it is not of an English type. Two sons of
1774,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the Northumbrian king Ida were called Theodric and Aethelric, perhaps"
1775,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,after the Gothic king Theodric and his successor Athalaric. As the
1776,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"element _theod-_ is somewhat rare in England, it is not unlikely that"
1777,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the Northumbrian prince Theodbald, a son of Aethelric, derived his name"
1778,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,from the Frankish king Theodbald.
1779,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
1780,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,The occurrence of such names as Widsith and Beowulf (_Biuulf_) in the
1781,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,Liber Vitae shows that names were taken not only from contemporary
1782,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,persons and from books but also from native poems and traditions.
1783,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,Indeed researches which have been made in this direction have
1784,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,demonstrated that names of the latter type were extremely popular. But
1785,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,it has not been sufficiently pointed out that such names occur most
1786,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,frequently in the earliest times and gradually become more rare--a fact
1787,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,which is of considerable importance for our purpose. The total number
1788,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"of personal names found in the five poems Beowulf, Finn, Waldhere,"
1789,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Widsith and Deor is 132[34], and of these altogether 57 recur as names"
1790,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,of persons mentioned in English historical documents. Over forty of
1791,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"these names belonged to persons who appear to have lived, or at any"
1792,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"rate to have been born, before the end of the seventh century[35],"
1793,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,while at least thirteen of them are unknown after the same period. To
1794,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,the latter class belong the important names Widsith and Beowulf.
1795,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
1796,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,In local nomenclature it is possible to trace at least 51 of the 132
1797,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,names mentioned above. In some cases these names may have been taken
1798,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"direct from the story, e.g. when we find in Kent two localities close"
1799,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"together called _Hokes clif_ and _Hengstes earas_ (Birch, _Cart."
1800,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Sax._, III 1000). A similar case, very frequently cited[36], is that"
1801,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,of _Beowanhammes hecgan_ and _Grendeles mere_ in Wiltshire (_ib._ II
1802,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"677), though neither of these names is included in our list. But in the"
1803,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,majority of cases it is more probable that the place-name is taken in
1804,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the first instance from that of a previous landowner, and consequently"
1805,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,that the connection with the story is only secondary. Hence it is
1806,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,important to notice that out of the 51 place-names no less than 19
1807,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,contain names which are not borne by persons in historical documents.
1808,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,The explanation of this lies doubtless in the fact that the place-names
1809,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"for the most part became fixed at a very early period, and consequently"
1810,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,that they exhibit an earlier stratum of personal nomenclature.
1811,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
1812,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,If we add the place-names to the personal names the total number of
1813,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,heroic names found in England in historical documents seems to be
1814,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,76. Out of this number only seven apparently are limited to persons
1815,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"born after the end of the seventh century, and of these again almost"
1816,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,all occur in the course of the eighth century. These statistics show
1817,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,clearly that such names were most popular during the sixth and seventh
1818,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"centuries, especially if we bear in mind that the materials for this"
1819,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,period are incomparably less than those for the following three
1820,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"centuries. Hence, if we are justified in drawing any conclusions from"
1821,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"nomenclature, the popularity of the heroic stories was distinctly on"
1822,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,the wane in Alcuin's time.
1823,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
1824,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,The argument from nomenclature holds good of course only for showing
1825,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,the popularity of the stories; it cannot prove the existence of the
1826,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,poems which we now possess. In one case however we may probably make an
1827,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,exception. The name _Widsith_ is obviously fictitious[37] and based on
1828,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the travels with which the minstrel is credited. The introduction, in"
1829,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"which alone the name occurs, is in all probability a later composition"
1830,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,than the rest of the poem[38] and designed to explain what follows. It
1831,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"is of importance therefore to note that, if we may judge from the place"
1832,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"in which this name occurs in the Liber Vitae, it must have been borne"
1833,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,by a person of the seventh century.
1834,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
1835,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,We must next turn to the internal evidence. The linguistic criteria
1836,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,are of a somewhat unsatisfactory nature and investigations in this
1837,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,field have led to few definite results. It is clear that the heroic
1838,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,poems do not exhibit any dialect in its purity--a remark which is
1839,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,true of Anglo-Saxon poetry in general. West Saxon forms predominate
1840,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,and there is no doubt that the final recension of the text is due to
1841,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,scribes who employed this dialect. Yet at the same time there are a
1842,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,sufficient number of Midland or Northumbrian characteristics[39] to
1843,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,render it highly probable that the poems were not only composed but
1844,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,also originally written down in one of these dialects. Beyond this
1845,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,however no safe conclusions can be attained owing to the lateness of
1846,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,the MSS.
1847,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
1848,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,In regard to syntax the heroic poems are at least as archaic as any
1849,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,other remains of Anglo-Saxon poetry which have come down to us. We may
1850,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"notice especially the use of the definite article, which in reality"
1851,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,is still a demonstrative pronoun in the heroic poems. It occurs
1852,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,comparatively seldom in connection with a weak adjective followed by a
1853,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,substantive--a usage which is nearly universal in most of the Christian
1854,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,poems. Thus in Cynewulf's works the proportion of examples with and
1855,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"without the article varies from 7:1 to 9:1, and even in the first part"
1856,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"of Guthlac, which is believed to date from soon after the middle of"
1857,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the eighth century, the proportion is 7:1[40]; but in Beowulf it is"
1858,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"only 1:5. If the Dream of the Cross, in which the proportion is 2:1,"
1859,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"is rightly attributed to the early years of the eighth century[41],"
1860,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,it seems reasonable to date the composition of Beowulf quite half a
1861,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,century further back. The nearest approach to the usage of Beowulf is
1862,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"shown by Exodus, in which the proportion is over 2:3. Unfortunately"
1863,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"we have no certain means of dating this work, though it is generally"
1864,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,believed to be one of the earliest of the Christian poems. Its archaic
1865,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"character would be natural enough if it is really the work of Caedmon,"
1866,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,who flourished while Hild was abbess at Whitby (658-680) and who
1867,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,according to Bede[42] did compose a poem or poems on this subject.
1868,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
1869,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,The metrical characteristics of the heroic poems differ but little from
1870,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,those of Anglo-Saxon poetry in general. Cases of absence of contraction
1871,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,after the loss of intervocalic _-h-_ (e.g. in the half-verse _hean
1872,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,huses_) can be paralleled in poems dating from the close of the eighth
1873,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"century or even later, where they are doubtless to be regarded as"
1874,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,poetic archaisms. On the other hand importance is generally attached
1875,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,to the absence of any evidence for the retention of _-u_ after a long
1876,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,syllable and to the shortening of syllables containing _-r-_ which
1877,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,was originally followed by antevocalic _-h-_. Thus it is contended
1878,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,that such combinations as _to widan feore_ in the latter half of a
1879,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"verse cannot go back to the middle of the seventh century[43], since"
1880,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the form in use at that time would be _feorha_, which would offend"
1881,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,against the metre. As a matter of fact half-verses of the condemned
1882,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"type do occur in Anglo-Saxon poetry, Beowulf itself containing at least"
1883,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,eight examples. But even if we were to admit all these statements
1884,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,and emend the offending verses the argument would be conclusive only
1885,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,on the assumption that the poems were written down from the very
1886,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,beginning[44]. Poems which are preserved by oral tradition alone are
1887,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"manifestly liable to small verbal changes, especially in a metre so"
1888,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,flexible as that of the Teutonic alliterative verse. Thus in place of
1889,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,the expression _to widan feore_ we find occasionally _widan feore_ in
1890,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the same sense, and even in Beowulf we meet with _widan feorh_ which"
1891,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,is not improbably the oldest form of the phrase. Before the loss
1892,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"of final _-u_ it would be a perfectly regular half-verse, but the"
1893,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,operation of this change would render it impossible and necessitate the
1894,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"substitution of a synonymous expression. In principle, it should be"
1895,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"observed, the assumption of such substitutions seems to be absolutely"
1896,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"necessary, unless we are prepared to deny that any old poems or even"
1897,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,verses survived the period of apocope. Yet there is a sufficient amount
1898,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"of resemblance between English and German poetry, not merely in the"
1899,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,general metrical scheme but also in the construction of individual
1900,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"verses[45], to render such a conclusion extremely improbable."
1901,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,Consequently I am very much inclined to doubt whether any safe
1902,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,conclusions as to the date of the poems can be obtained from metrical
1903,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"considerations, except of course as regards their final form."
1904,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
1905,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,Of far greater importance is the fact that with the exception of the
1906,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Finn-fragment, which consists of only fifty verses, all our poems"
1907,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,contain passages or references of a religious (Christian) character.
1908,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,In Beowulf alone there are about seventy such passages of which the
1909,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"significance is not open to question, and seven or eight others which"
1910,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,may belong to the same category. Out of the total number thirty-three
1911,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"are limited to single verses or half-verses[46], while another sixteen"
1912,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,affect not more than two verses in each case[47]. The longest passage
1913,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"of all (v. 1724 ff.) contains at least 37 verses, the next longest (v."
1914,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,175 ff.) fourteen. The rest vary from three to nine verses[48]. The
1915,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,theology which appears in these passages is of a singularly vague type.
1916,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,There are four distinct references to incidents in the early part of
1917,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Genesis, viz. one (v. 90 ff.) to the Creation, two (vv. 107 ff., 1261"
1918,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,ff.) to the story of Cain and Abel and one (v. 1688 ff.) to the Flood.
1919,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,Apart from these there appears to be no reference to any passage in
1920,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the Bible except perhaps in v. 1745 ff., which are thought by some to"
1921,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"be based on Ephes. vi. 16, and in v. 3069, which contains the phrase"
1922,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,'day of judgment.' We find also a few references to rewards and
1923,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,punishments in a future life[49]. The word _god_ is of very frequent
1924,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,occurrence and always used in the Christian sense. The other epithets
1925,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"of the Deity are 'lord' (_frea_, _dryhten_), 'father' (_faeder_),"
1926,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"'creator' (_scyppend_), 'ruler' (_waldend_), 'almighty' (_alwalda_,"
1927,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"_aelmihtiga_), 'ruler of men' (_ylda_ or _fira waldend_), 'ruler of"
1928,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"glory' (_wuldres waldend_), 'shepherd of glory' (_wuldres hyrde_),"
1929,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"'king of glory' (_wuldurcyning_), 'guider of the heavens' (_rodera"
1930,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"raedend_), 'helm of the heavens' (_heofena helm_), 'ruler of victories'"
1931,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"(_sigora waldend_), 'king of victories' (_sigora soðcyning_). On the"
1932,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,other hand there is no example of the word _gast_ in a religious sense
1933,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"(Holy Ghost), nor of the name _Crist_, nor of any epithet denoting"
1934,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"'Saviour' (_nergend_, _haelend_ etc.). Hardly less curious is the total"
1935,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"absence of the word _engel_, for expressions such as 'lord of angels'"
1936,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,(_engla dryhten_[50]) are among the most frequent epithets of the Deity
1937,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"in Anglo-Saxon religious poems. Lastly, there are no references to the"
1938,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"saints, to the cross or to the church, nor to any Christian rites or"
1939,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,ceremonies.
1940,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
1941,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,It appears then that the religious utterances of the poem are of a
1942,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"singularly one-sided character. Indeed it has been observed[51] that,"
1943,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"with the exception perhaps of vv. 977-9, ""their theology is covered"
1944,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"by the Old Testament, and a pious Jew would have no difficulty in"
1945,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"assenting to them all."" Certainly the facts are such as to call for"
1946,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"some explanation, especially since the religious poems are pervaded by"
1947,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,a wholly different tone.
1948,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
1949,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,One suggestion is that Beowulf was composed under the influence of
1950,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,the missionaries from Iona; but it is extremely doubtful whether
1951,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,the influence of Irish Christianity would tend in this direction at
1952,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,all[52]. Another is that the poet had little direct knowledge of the
1953,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Christian religion, but that he was acquainted with some religious"
1954,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,poems. This explanation certainly seems to fit the case much better
1955,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,than the other. Moreover there is one piece of positive evidence in its
1956,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,favour. In Beow. v. 89 ff. we hear of recitation to the accompaniment
1957,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"of the harp in Hrothgar's hall, and the subject of the recitation is"
1958,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,the creation of the world. It appears to me highly probable that we
1959,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"have here an allusion to Caedmon's poem or poems on Genesis, which may"
1960,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,very well have been among the earliest of that poet's productions. At
1961,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,all events it was by his hymn on the Creation that he first became
1962,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,known. The inference is strengthened by the rather close resemblance
1963,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,which the hymn bears to the phraseology of Beowulf. If the two poets
1964,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,were contemporary the author of Beowulf would have no other Christian
1965,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"poet on whom to draw, and the limitations of his theological equipment"
1966,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,might be satisfactorily accounted for on the hypothesis that he knew
1967,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,only a few of Caedmon's works. As a matter of fact two or three out of
1968,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,the list given by Bede[53] would have been quite sufficient to provide
1969,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,him with all the statements and terms that he uses.
1970,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
1971,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,There is another question however with regard to the composition of
1972,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Beowulf which has aroused more controversy than this, namely whether"
1973,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,the Christian passages formed an original part of the poem or not. In
1974,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,the former case of course the poem cannot have been composed before the
1975,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"second quarter of the seventh century. Indeed, if we grant the use of"
1976,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,Caedmon's poetry the earliest possible date would be about 660. On the
1977,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,other hand if the Christian passages are due to interpolation the upper
1978,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,limit for the dating of the poem vanishes into air.
1979,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
1980,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,As to the possibility of such interpolation in principle we need
1981,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,scarcely entertain any doubt. It is true that the Christian passages
1982,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,or references cannot as a rule be removed without breaking into the
1983,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"rhythm. Consequently, if interpolation has taken place we must assume"
1984,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"it to be the work of poets or minstrels, and not of scribes. But"
1985,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,have we any reason for doubting that the minstrels of that period
1986,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,were capable of such 'interpolation.' Wherever poetry--at all events
1987,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"anonymous narrative poetry--is preserved exclusively by oral tradition,"
1988,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,it is usually the case that the minstrel is allowed a certain amount
1989,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,of freedom in the presentation of his subject.[54] Now probably no one
1990,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,will suggest that it was only after their conversion to Christianity
1991,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"that the English began to compose poems about 'heathen kings.' But,"
1992,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"if we grant that such poems were already in existence, does it really"
1993,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,involve a greater amount of effort on the part of the minstrels to
1994,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,bring these poems up to date--by removing objectionable matter and
1995,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,introducing expressions in accordance with the new religion--than to
1996,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,compose an entirely new set of poems on the same subjects. I cannot
1997,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,think that such a view will be seriously maintained. Therefore we must
1998,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,consider the case of Beowulf--the only narrative poem which has come
1999,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,down to us entire--without prejudice on the general question; and we
2000,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,must endeavour to see whether it bears the stamp of a new composition
2001,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,or that of an old work which has been brought into conformity with new
2002,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,ideas. The probability or improbability of the latter view will of
2003,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,course depend largely on the amount of inconsistency which the poem is
2004,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,found to contain.
2005,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
2006,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,Until within the last few years the majority of scholars believed that
2007,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,Beowulf was a composite work. This theory was most fully developed in
2008,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,the writings of Müllenhoff and ten Brink. According to the former[55]
2009,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the poem was made up from four separate lays, though in its present"
2010,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,form nearly half of it is the work of interpolators. The latter[56]
2011,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"likewise traced the origin of the poem to lays, but explained its"
2012,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,inconsistencies as being due not to extensive interpolations but to
2013,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,the combination of two parallel versions. In regard to the relative
2014,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,antiquity of the various parts of the poem there was great divergence
2015,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,of opinion both between these scholars and generally. It is perhaps
2016,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,partly on this account that in recent years there has been a reaction
2017,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,in favour of believing that the poem as we have it is practically
2018,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the work of one man, though it is allowed that he may have made use"
2019,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,of earlier lays. But those who have adopted this view seem to agree
2020,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"that the author, whatever his precise date, belonged to the Christian"
2021,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"period, and consequently that the religious passages are not due to"
2022,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,interpolation.
2023,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
2024,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,Now in the first place it is clear that the story of Beowulf is derived
2025,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"from the Baltic, and the first question which we have to settle is as"
2026,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,to the time at which the information on which it is based became known
2027,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"in England. The Angli themselves were originally a Baltic people, as I"
2028,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"have tried elsewhere to show, and there is no doubt that down to the"
2029,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,time of the invasion of Britain they were thoroughly familiar with all
2030,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,the surrounding regions. But we have no evidence whatever for believing
2031,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,that such was the case within the historical period. By the end of the
2032,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"sixth century, when the first missionaries arrived in this country,"
2033,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"they had apparently ceased to be a seafaring people, and we have no"
2034,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,record of any voyage made by an Englishman across the North Sea for
2035,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"several centuries. Again, the Danes became familiar to the west of"
2036,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,Europe during the sixth century; but from about 580 onwards we hear
2037,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,no more of their presence on the North Sea for fully two centuries.
2038,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,During the whole of this period their name is heard of only in
2039,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"connection with the missionary expeditions of St Willibrord, early in"
2040,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,the eighth century. I have suggested elsewhere[57] that their temporary
2041,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,disappearance was due to the maritime supremacy held by the Frisians.
2042,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,At all events we have archaeological evidence for a considerable amount
2043,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,of communication between southern Norway and the Frisian coasts during
2044,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"this period, while for the Baltic such evidence is almost wholly"
2045,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,wanting.
2046,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
2047,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,Bearing these facts in mind we can hardly doubt that the information
2048,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,used by Beowulf was acquired before the end of the sixth century--in
2049,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,all probability we may say considerably before that date.[58] Next we
2050,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,have to notice that we have practically no trustworthy information
2051,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,regarding the history of the English kingdoms before the middle of the
2052,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"sixth century, and I think it will be the opinion of any attentive"
2053,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,student of early English history that even the best informed persons of
2054,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,Bede's time were not much better off in this respect than we ourselves
2055,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,are. How then are we to account for the preservation of detailed
2056,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,information regarding the early kings of the Danes and Swedes? The only
2057,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"answer to this question, so far as I can see, is that the doings of"
2058,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,such persons must have become embodied in stories which were preserved
2059,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,by recitation in a more or less fixed form of words. Such recitative
2060,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,pieces may have consisted of poetry alone or of poetry mixed with
2061,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"prose, like some of the pieces contained in the Older Edda. If we"
2062,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,may trust the analogy of what appear to be the oldest pieces in this
2063,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"collection, such as Völundarkviða or Helgakviða Hundingsbana II, the"
2064,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"speeches would be given in metre, while the connecting narrative might"
2065,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,be partly or wholly in prose and quite brief. We have no evidence for
2066,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,believing that the early Teutonic peoples ever used entirely prose
2067,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"narratives, like the Icelandic and Irish sagas, for such purposes."
2068,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
2069,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,At all events it seems to me that if Beowulf is no older than the
2070,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,middle of the seventh century we are bound to assume the existence of
2071,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,earlier poems or narratives on the same subject. Such pieces may of
2072,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"course have been quite short, and it is likely enough that our epic"
2073,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,has made use of more than one of them. One perhaps may have dealt
2074,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,with the hero's exploits at the Danish court and another with his
2075,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"last adventure, while in the scene between Beowulf and Hygelac it"
2076,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"is possible that an older poem has been incorporated, more or less"
2077,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"complete, in the text.[59]"
2078,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
2079,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,But we have yet to take account of what is perhaps the most striking
2080,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"feature of the poem, namely the fact that, though it abounds in"
2081,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"expressions of Christian sentiment, yet the customs and ceremonies to"
2082,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,which it alludes are uniformly heathen. Among these we may mention
2083,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the funeral ship in v. 27 ff., the offerings at the shrines in v. 175"
2084,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"f., the observation of the omens in v. 204 and the curious reference"
2085,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"to hanging in v. 2444 ff. (cf. v. 2939 ff.), probably also the use"
2086,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"of the boar on helmets (vv. 303 f., 1111 f., 1286, 1451 ff., 2152)"
2087,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"and the burial of the treasure (v. 2233 ff.), together with the curse"
2088,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,imprecated on the person who should disturb it (v. 3069 ff.). But most
2089,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,important of all are the descriptions of the disposal of the dead by
2090,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"cremation in vv. 1108 ff., 2124 ff., 3137 ff. In the long account"
2091,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,of Beowulf's obsequies--beginning with the dying king's injunction
2092,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,(v. 2802 ff.) to construct for him a lofty barrow on the edge of the
2093,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"cliff, and ending with the scene of the twelve princes riding round the"
2094,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"barrow, proclaiming the dead man's exploits--we have the most detailed"
2095,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"description of an early Teutonic funeral which has come down to us, and"
2096,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,one of which the accuracy is confirmed in every point by archaeological
2097,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,or contemporary literary evidence[60]. Such an account must have been
2098,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,composed within living memory of a time when ceremonies of this kind
2099,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,were still actually in use.
2100,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
2101,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,The significance of these passages seems to me to have been altogether
2102,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,misapprehended by recent writers. If the poem preserves its original
2103,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"form and is the work of a Christian, it is difficult to see why the"
2104,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,poet should go out of his way in v. 175 ff. to represent the Danes as
2105,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,offering heathen sacrifices; for not long before he has introduced a
2106,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"song of the Creation at the Danish court, and in the sequel Hrothgar is"
2107,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,constantly giving utterance to Christian sentiments. Again why should
2108,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"he lay Beowulf himself to rest with heathen obsequies, described in"
2109,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"all possible detail, when in his dying speeches (vv. 2739 ff., 2794"
2110,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,ff.[61]) the hero has been made to express his faith and gratitude to
2111,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,the Almighty? On the other hand if the poem was originally a heathen
2112,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,work these inconsistencies are perfectly natural. If it was to retain
2113,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,its place after the change of faith and to be recited in the presence
2114,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"of bishops or clergy, all references to actual heathen worship or"
2115,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,belief would of necessity have to be either accompanied by censure--as
2116,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,is the case in the homiletic verses following v. 175 ff.--or else
2117,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"suppressed altogether, and their place taken by expressions in"
2118,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,accordance with Christian doctrine. Hence it seems to me probable that
2119,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,such expressions are frequently in the nature of substitutions for
2120,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"objectionable matter, rather than gratuitous additions; and in the same"
2121,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,way I would account for the occasional survival of ideas which appear
2122,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"to be essentially heathen[62], though they are cloaked in Christian"
2123,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"phraseology. But references to practices such as cremation which,"
2124,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"though heathen, had long ago passed out of use, would not excite the"
2125,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,same repugnance and consequently might be allowed to stand.
2126,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
2127,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,It may be urged[63] that cremation seems to have lingered on among the
2128,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,Old Saxons of the Continent until late in the eighth century. True:
2129,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,but it is quite incredible that a Christian poet should borrow from
2130,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,this quarter a method of funeral for his Christianised heroes. If the
2131,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,description of Beowulf's obsequies stood alone a bare possibility might
2132,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"be conceded to the suggestion that it had once formed a poem by itself,"
2133,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"unconnected with Beowulf, and based upon a traveller's story. But"
2134,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"cremation is clearly regarded as the normal rite throughout the poem,"
2135,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,apart from the legendary story of Scyld. We have another description of
2136,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"it in the episode dealing with Finn (v. 1108 ff.), and above all there"
2137,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"is the purely incidental reference in v. 2124 ff.: ""Yet when morning"
2138,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,came the knights of the Danes could not burn his (Aeschere's) lifeless
2139,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"form with fire, nor lay the man they loved on the pyre. She had carried"
2140,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the body away,"" etc. Here the poet realises the significance[64] of the"
2141,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,rite quite clearly and consequently notes that the inability of the
2142,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,Danes to carry it out added materially to their sorrow. In such a case
2143,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,the possibility of Christian authorship seems to me to be definitely
2144,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,excluded.
2145,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
2146,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,On the hypothesis that these descriptions had come down from the days
2147,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,of English heathenism all is easily explicable. At the time when the
2148,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,poem was Christianised it may very well not have been known that
2149,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,the rite of cremation was still practised among the heathen of the
2150,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Continent, and in later days the verses of the old poet would be"
2151,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,handed on in parrot fashion without their significance being generally
2152,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"understood. Well informed persons however, like Alcuin, who had"
2153,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"travelled abroad, perceived clearly enough that, however much coated"
2154,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"over with Christian phraseology, the heroic poems were in reality of an"
2155,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,essentially heathen character.
2156,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
2157,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,Now cremation was widely prevalent in this country during the early
2158,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,days of the Saxon invasion--a fact attested by numerous cemeteries
2159,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"especially in the northern and midland counties, including the valley"
2160,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,of the Thames. But it appears to have become a thing of the past when
2161,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,the Roman missionaries arrived here; otherwise it is difficult to
2162,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,account for the absence of any reference to the custom in the records
2163,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,which have come down to us. Indeed we may say with safety that it had
2164,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"passed out of general use, at least in the southern half of England,"
2165,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,quite a generation before this time; for there are scarcely any traces
2166,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,of it to be found in those western districts which appear to have been
2167,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"conquered during the latter half of the sixth century. Consequently,"
2168,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,if we are justified in believing that the descriptions of cremation
2169,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,ceremonies contained in Beowulf date from a time when the practice was
2170,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"still remembered, we must conclude that they were composed not later"
2171,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,than the third or fourth decade of the seventh century[65].
2172,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
2173,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"But it is not contended, so far as I am aware, by any scholar that the"
2174,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,account of Beowulf's obsequies belongs to the earlier parts of the
2175,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"poem. It is the final scene of the story, it is not contained in any"
2176,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"speech, and further it is of a thoroughly epic character and would"
2177,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"be quite out of place in a short lay. Hence, if the line of argument"
2178,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"which we have been following is legitimate, we shall be forced to admit"
2179,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,that though the poem has undergone a fairly thorough revision in early
2180,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Christian times, it must in the main have been in existence some time"
2181,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,before the conversion. I do not mean to suggest that the 'revision' was
2182,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,entirely limited to the religious element. Other changes and additions
2183,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,may have been made about the same time[66]. What I do mean is that
2184,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,the great bulk of the poem must have been in existence--not merely as
2185,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"a collection of lays or stories, but in full epic form--an appreciable"
2186,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,time before the middle of the seventh century.

2188,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,*       *       *       *       *
2189,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
2190,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,The other heroic poems do not furnish us with any similar criteria for
2191,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"estimating the date of their composition, but there seems to be no"
2192,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"valid reason for doubting that they are quite as early. Two of them,"
2193,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Deor and Widsith, are expressed in the first person and lay claim to"
2194,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,being of a remote antiquity. Deor says that he had been the bard of
2195,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,the Heodeningas and that he had been displaced by a skilful minstrel
2196,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,named Heorrenda. Since in old Norse literature _Hiaðningar_ (i.e.
2197,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"_Heodeningas_) means 'Heðinn and his men,'[67] and since Heorrenda can"
2198,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"hardly be separated from the minstrel Hôrand in Kûdrûn, it would seem"
2199,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"that the poet claims to have been a contemporary of Heðinn and Högni,"
2200,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"with whose story we have dealt briefly above (pp. 8 f., 16)."
2201,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
2202,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,Widsith is still more explicit. The poet states that he visited the
2203,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Gothic king Eormenric, who as we know died about 370. It is true"
2204,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,that incidentally he mentions that he had met with a number of other
2205,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"princes, some of whom lived in the fifth and sixth centuries; but the"
2206,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,visit to Eormenric is his main theme. Eormenric is of course one of
2207,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the most prominent figures of the Heroic Age, and it may be for this"
2208,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,reason--as the type of a powerful king--that he is chosen for the
2209,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,poet's host and patron. But then it is by no means so easy to see why
2210,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"he is associated with such an obscure person as Eadgils, prince of the"
2211,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,Myrgingas. The suggestion that the poem is founded upon a tradition
2212,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,that this Eadgils possessed a famous minstrel breaks down upon the
2213,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"name _Widsith_, which is obviously fictitious as we have seen (p. 44)."
2214,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,It appears to me that considerably less difficulty is involved in the
2215,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,hypothesis that the kernel of the poem[68] is really the work of an
2216,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"unknown bard of the fourth century, and that successive minstrels from"
2217,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,time to time have added the names of famous heroes with which they were
2218,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,acquainted[69]--a process to which the original plan of the poem may
2219,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,well have offered inducement.
2220,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
2221,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,However this may be neither of the poems shows any characteristics
2222,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,which suggest a later date than Beowulf. Both appear to be constructed
2223,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"in strophic form, a feature rare elsewhere in Anglo-Saxon poetry, while"
2224,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Deor also has a refrain, which is almost without parallel. Lastly, we"
2225,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"have seen that _Widsith_ occurs as a personal name, apparently in the"
2226,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"seventh century, and that this presupposes the existence not only of"
2227,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the poem itself but also of the introduction, which is clearly later."
2228,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
2229,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"The case of Waldhere stands somewhat apart from the others, since it"
2230,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,has been suggested that this is really a translation of a lost German
2231,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"poem, on which Ekkehard's Waltharius is also based. That the story"
2232,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,came from the Continent may of course be granted; but we have also to
2233,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,consider when and in what form it was brought. The linguistic arguments
2234,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,which have been adduced in favour of the German origin of the poem
2235,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,are not now generally maintained. But it is further to be noticed
2236,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,that the poet seems to have treated his subject very differently from
2237,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Ekkehard. The speeches, with which the fragments are entirely taken"
2238,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"up, have nothing corresponding to them in the Latin poem, while the"
2239,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,characterisation of the heroine is as unlike as it well could be.
2240,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Ekkehard represents her as a timid creature, but in the fragments she"
2241,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,displays a spirit which may fairly be called martial. It is unwise to
2242,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,lay stress on agreements between Ekkehard and the fragments as against
2243,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,the version of the story given in Thiðreks Saga af Bern. The less
2244,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,complicated form of the latter--in which Guthhere is omitted and Hagena
2245,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"represented as an officer of Attila, pursuing the fugitives--may be"
2246,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"due either to imperfect acquaintance with the story or, perhaps more"
2247,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"probably, to the conditions under which it had been preserved. We shall"
2248,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,see later that for a considerable period heroic poetry appears to have
2249,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,been entirely neglected by the higher classes in Germany; and it may
2250,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,be accepted as generally true that when stories are preserved only by
2251,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the peasants complex situations tend to become simplified, while all"
2252,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,except the most prominent characters drop out. As for the date at which
2253,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,the story became known in England we may note that besides _Aetla_ and
2254,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"_Hagena_, which may come from other sources, _Waldhere_, _Hildegyth_"
2255,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,and _Hereric_ were all names current during the seventh century. There
2256,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,seems therefore to be no adequate reason for believing Waldhere to have
2257,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,had a different history from the other heroic poems.
2258,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
2259,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"On the whole, taking all the poems, including Beowulf, together, we may"
2260,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,conclude with probability that they assumed substantially their present
2261,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,form[70] in the course of the seventh century. But if our reasoning
2262,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,with regard to the composition of Beowulf is correct we shall have to
2263,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"refer the first treatment of the subject to the sixth century, i.e."
2264,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,almost if not quite to the Heroic Age itself. Deor and Widsith may
2265,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,quite possibly contain still older elements.

2268,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
2269,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,We may now turn to the Old Norse poems. Here the data at our disposal
2270,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"are of a very different character, for the metrical evidence is said to"
2271,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,preclude the possibility that any of the extant poems date from before
2272,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,the ninth century. It may perhaps be questioned whether all of them are
2273,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,necessarily new compositions since that time--whether certain of them
2274,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,may not be old poems somewhat recast. To this question however we can
2275,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,hardly hope to obtain a satisfactory answer.
2276,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
2277,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"The fragmentary Ragnarsdrápa of Bragi Boddason, who seems to have lived"
2278,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"in the first half of the ninth century, is probably the earliest extant"
2279,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,piece which refers to stories of the Heroic Age. In this poem we find
2280,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,allusions both to the story of Heðinn and Högni and to the attack made
2281,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"upon Iörmunrekr by Hamðir and Sörli. Thiódolfr's Ynglingatal, perhaps"
2282,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"half a century later, contains references to the story of Hagbarðr and"
2283,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Signý, as well as brief accounts of the Swedish kings Óttarr and Aðils,"
2284,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"who are mentioned in Beowulf (cf. p. 20). All these stories, except"
2285,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"that of Óttarr, are told also by Saxo, but in a somewhat different"
2286,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"form, which points to their derivation from Danish rather than Norse"
2287,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,sources[71].
2288,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
2289,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"On the other hand the stories of the Völsungar, Sigmundr and Sigurðr,"
2290,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,are not mentioned by any early Danish authority. The story of Sigurðr
2291,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,is generally supposed to have been introduced into Norway from Germany;
2292,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"and in some sense or other this would seem necessarily to be true,"
2293,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"since in the Northern version, as well as in the German, the scene"
2294,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,is laid chiefly in the Rhineland. But it is apparently impossible
2295,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,to determine when and in what form the story was transmitted. We
2296,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,have already noticed that there is archaeological evidence for a
2297,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,considerable amount of communication between Norway (not Denmark) and
2298,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,the southern (Frisian) coasts of the North Sea during the seventh
2299,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"and eighth centuries, and this is clearly a factor which deserves to"
2300,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"be taken into account. Further, it is worth noting that, with the"
2301,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"exception perhaps of _Atli_[72], the names all appear in regular"
2302,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Northern form[73], as if they had been known from the earliest times,"
2303,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"e.g. _Gunnarr_, _Högni_, _Giúki_, _Buðli_. This consideration, as far"
2304,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"as it goes, certainly favours a very early date; but it is hardly"
2305,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,conclusive[74].
2306,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
2307,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,The story of Sigmundr stands on a somewhat different footing. In the
2308,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,first place Sigemund (Sigmundr) himself is little more than a name in
2309,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"German tradition, while though _Welsung_ and _Sintarfizzilo_ occur"
2310,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"as personal names, they are not connected in any way with the story"
2311,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"of Siegfried. Again, in the Helgi poems, which contain no reference"
2312,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"to Sigurðr, Sigmundr is connected with the Baltic, and this is still"
2313,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"more clearly the case with his son Helgi, who is unknown to the German"
2314,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"story. Thirdly, in Beowulf, which knows Sigemund and Fitela, though"
2315,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"not Sigurðr, the former is brought into juxtaposition, and apparently"
2316,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"also into comparison, with a Danish prince named Heremod. The same two"
2317,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"persons are brought together also in the Old Norse poem Hyndlulióð,"
2318,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,while the Hákonarmál likewise seems to imply some connection between
2319,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"them, as I have tried to show elsewhere[75]. Apart from the passages"
2320,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,specified this Hermóðr (Heremod) is apparently not mentioned in
2321,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Scandinavian literature, but the facts noted seem to indicate that"
2322,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,the two characters were connected in poetry before English and Danish
2323,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"tradition became separated, i.e. presumably in the sixth century."
2324,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
2325,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,We have seen that many of the persons mentioned in the main narrative
2326,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,of Beowulf were remembered also in Scandinavian tradition. But since
2327,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"these persons are in all probability to be regarded as historical, it"
2328,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"is hardly safe to infer the existence of ancient Scandinavian poems,"
2329,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"unless the same incidents are related of them, which is generally not"
2330,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,the case. There is a rather striking verbal resemblance[76] between
2331,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,the first speech of Wiglaf (Beow. 2633-60) and certain passages in
2332,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Biarkamál (especially Saxo's version), where Hialti is addressing"
2333,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,Biarki; and this fact is the more noteworthy if Biarki is really to be
2334,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,identified with Beowulf. But the words themselves are of a somewhat
2335,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,general character and might have been used on other occasions. Again
2336,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,there is a certain affinity[77] between the account of the dragon-fight
2337,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,in Beowulf and that of a similar incident related of Frotho I by Saxo
2338,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,(p. 38 f.); and here again a connection can be traced indirectly
2339,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,between the two heroes. But the story of Frotho seems really rather to
2340,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,resemble the account given in Beowulf of Sigemund's dragon-fight; so it
2341,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,may be questioned whether the points of affinity between the two did
2342,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,not originally form part of a standard description of incidents of this
2343,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,kind.
2344,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
2345,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"A clearer case is that of the poems attributed by Saxo to Starcatherus,"
2346,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,in which that warrior exhorts Ingellus to avenge his father. These
2347,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,are clearly to be connected with the speech of the old warrior to
2348,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Ingeld in Beowulf (vv. 2047-2056), though there is little verbal"
2349,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,resemblance. Moreover we have seen (p. 41 f.) that in Alcuin's time
2350,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,poems dealing with Ingeld were known and probably popular in England.
2351,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,The relationship of the passage in Beowulf to these may be compared
2352,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,with that of another passage (vv. 1068-1159) to the fragment dealing
2353,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,with Finn. The poems on Ingeld given by Saxo are traced by Prof.
2354,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,Olrik[78] to a Danish source; and there can be little doubt that his
2355,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"view is correct, as they share the characteristics exhibited by other"
2356,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,stories which appear to come from the same quarter (cf. p. 111). Thus
2357,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,the queen's name is not given and her brothers are described simply
2358,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"as sons of Suertingus. Further, the story is cut right away from the"
2359,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"surroundings in which we find it in Beowulf, and it may be that for"
2360,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"a time it survived in Denmark only in ballad form. Yet, however much"
2361,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"change it had undergone before it came under Saxo's treatment, there"
2362,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"can be little doubt, in view of the English evidence, that its origin"
2363,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"is ultimately to be sought in heroic poetry, or at all events heroic"
2364,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"narrative, dating from the sixth century."
2365,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
2366,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Lastly we must mention the story of Uffo's single combat, though,"
2367,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"strictly speaking, this is probably not of Danish origin. It was"
2368,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,certainly well known in England and there is good reason for believing
2369,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"that its home is to be found in the district to which it refers,"
2370,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"i.e. the neighbourhood of Angel, Slesvig and Rendsburg. I have tried"
2371,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,elsewhere[79] to show that this story also rests on historical
2372,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"foundations. But the details of the combat, as given by Saxo and Svend"
2373,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Aagesen, and certain legendary features, such as the dumbness or"
2374,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"silence of the hero, which are present in both the Danish and English"
2375,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"versions of the story, strongly favour the view that it was embodied"
2376,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,in poetic form at a very early period. On the other hand there is
2377,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,nothing to show that such poems survived till Saxo's time. The story is
2378,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,apparently unknown to all Norse authorities.
2379,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
2380,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,*       *       *       *       *
2381,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
2382,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,Many of the German poems which have come down to us are known to be
2383,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"derived, directly or indirectly, from earlier ones, but regarding the"
2384,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,antiquity of the latter nothing can be stated with certainty. The
2385,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Hildebrandslied, which is the only extant piece of early poetry, goes"
2386,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"back at all events to the eighth century. Further, the language[80]"
2387,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,used by Einhard in describing the poems collected by Charlemagne (cf.
2388,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,p. 5 f.) would scarcely be appropriate unless they were believed to be
2389,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,more than a century old by that time. We may probably therefore refer
2390,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,them at least to the seventh century.
2391,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
2392,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,It seems likely that some of the lost poems of the Langobardi were of
2393,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,still greater antiquity. In the poem which celebrated their victory
2394,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"over the Vandals (cf. p. 10), a story with which we shall have to"
2395,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"deal more fully in a later chapter, a very prominent part appears to"
2396,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,have been played by the heathen gods. Such a piece can hardly have
2397,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"been composed after the end of the fifth century, at which time the"
2398,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,Langobardi were already Christians.
2399,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
2400,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,Regarding the antiquity of Gothic heroic poetry there can be no
2401,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"question, for Jordanes, our chief authority on this subject, wrote"
2402,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"about the middle of the sixth century, i.e. during the Heroic Age"
2403,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,itself. We have already noticed (p. 37) that his account of Eormenric
2404,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,appears to be coloured by poetic tradition. But of the heroes whom
2405,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"he enumerates (cap. 5) as celebrated in poetry, the only one of whom"
2406,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"we know anything, Vidigoia, is described as _Gothorum fortissimus_"
2407,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"in a quotation (cap. 34) from Priscus, who lived about a century"
2408,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,earlier[81]. There is good reason therefore for believing that the
2409,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,Goths possessed heroic poems as early as the first half of the fifth
2410,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,century.
2411,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,
2412,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,We may now sum up briefly the results of our discussion. The heroic
2413,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"poetry of the Goths certainly belonged to the Heroic Age itself, and it"
2414,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,is more than likely that certain Langobardic poems were nearly as old.
2415,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,Some heroic poems belonging to other German peoples may probably be
2416,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,referred at least to the seventh century. The chief monument of English
2417,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"heroic poetry must be ascribed to the first half of that century, while"
2418,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,some of the other poems claim to be of greater antiquity. The lost
2419,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,heroic poetry of the Danes seems to have been occupied largely with the
2420,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"same subjects as the English poems, and since the stories generally"
2421,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,refer to the Baltic we may reasonably infer that heroic poetry
2422,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,flourished in that region during the sixth century. On the whole then
2423,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,it seems probable that the development of heroic poetry began in the
2424,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Heroic Age itself, not only among the Goths but throughout the greater"
2425,THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE HEROIC POEMS.,part of the Teutonic world.

2651,NOTE I. THE USE OF HEROIC NAMES IN ENGLAND.,
2652,NOTE I. THE USE OF HEROIC NAMES IN ENGLAND.,The fact that so many heroic names occur in the Liber Vitae has led
2653,NOTE I. THE USE OF HEROIC NAMES IN ENGLAND.,several writers to conclude that the true home of English heroic

2655,NOTE I. THE USE OF HEROIC NAMES IN ENGLAND.,by the evidence. The number of personal names recorded for the south
2656,NOTE I. THE USE OF HEROIC NAMES IN ENGLAND.,of England during the sixth and seventh centuries is very small; yet

2660,NOTE I. THE USE OF HEROIC NAMES IN ENGLAND.,28 occur in place-names in various parts of England. The frequence

2664,NOTE I. THE USE OF HEROIC NAMES IN ENGLAND.,
2665,NOTE I. THE USE OF HEROIC NAMES IN ENGLAND.,Including the evidence of the Liber Vitae there are fifteen heroic
2666,NOTE I. THE USE OF HEROIC NAMES IN ENGLAND.,names which seem to be borne only by persons of the eighth century or

2668,NOTE I. THE USE OF HEROIC NAMES IN ENGLAND.,the remaining seven[92] all except one or possibly two[93] make their
2669,NOTE I. THE USE OF HEROIC NAMES IN ENGLAND.,appearance during the eighth century. On the other hand it has already

2672,NOTE I. THE USE OF HEROIC NAMES IN ENGLAND.,
2673,NOTE I. THE USE OF HEROIC NAMES IN ENGLAND.,We have still to mention a few heroic names which are not found in the

2675,NOTE I. THE USE OF HEROIC NAMES IN ENGLAND.,"from the sixth century, Hild, Herding, Iuring, Omoling only from the"
2676,NOTE I. THE USE OF HEROIC NAMES IN ENGLAND.,"seventh, Hildegyth and Blaedla from the seventh and eighth, Wulfheard"

2679,NOTE I. THE USE OF HEROIC NAMES IN ENGLAND.,"and Ecga are found also in place-names. In some of these cases, e.g."
2680,NOTE I. THE USE OF HEROIC NAMES IN ENGLAND.,"in that of Hildegyth, the non-occurrence of the name in the poems is"
2681,NOTE I. THE USE OF HEROIC NAMES IN ENGLAND.,clearly due to mere accident; but it would scarcely be safe to assume

2774,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"Mercian and Northumbrian, may be dated about 700, but after the loss of"
2775,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,_-u_ (p. 265). In summarising the results of his discussion (p. 273)
2776,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"he gives ""about 700"" for the loss of postconsonantal _h_ and ""shortly"
2777,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"before 700"" for the loss of _-u_. Incidentally he follows Bülbring"
2778,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"(_Elementarbuch_, §§ 146, 528) in dating the origin of _ē_ (from 'West"
2779,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"Germ.' _ā_) before the breaking, and in placing the loss of _h_ before"
2780,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,_l_ (in _neolaecan_) anterior to the operation of 'palatal umlaut'
2781,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,(monophthongisation).
2782,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,
2783,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,The importance of this discussion for our present purpose[97] lies
2784,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,in the dates proposed for the loss of _-u_ and of postconsonantal _h_.
2785,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,Prof. Morsbach concludes that Beowulf cannot have been composed before
2786,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"700, since it contains a number of half-verses which would have been"
2787,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"metrically impossible before the operation of these changes, e.g."
2788,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"_ofer fealone flod(u)_, _to widan feor(h)e_. I have already expressed"
2789,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,scepticism as to whether such inferences are really justifiable. This
2790,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,applies more particularly to the verses affected by the question of
2791,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"postconsonantal _h_, which are quite few in number. The date which"
2792,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,Prof. Morsbach himself (p. 274) proposes for the composition of Beowulf
2793,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,is 700-730. He finds no difficulty in reconciling this with the
2794,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"statistics (given above, p. 45) for the use of the article. This seems"
2795,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,to me rather strange; yet the opinion of a scholar who stands in such
2796,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,deservedly high estimation cannot lightly be disregarded.
2797,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,
2798,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,Now let us examine the evidence on which these conclusions are based.
2799,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,First it will be convenient to take the loss of _h_. Prof. Morsbach
2800,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,holds that in Kentish intervocalic _h_ was lost before postconsonantal
2801,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,_h_. The evidence is derived from a single charter issued by King
2802,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"Hlothhere in 679 (Birch, _Cart. Sax._ 45), which contains the"
2803,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,place-name _Vuestan ae_ beside the personal name _Velhisci_ (Latin
2804,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,Gen.). But surely conclusions of this kind are admissible only when
2805,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,a number of examples can be adduced. On the same principle we might
2806,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,argue from the name _Irminredi_ (in the same charter) that the change
2807,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,_ǣ_ > _ē_ had taken place and also from the name _Aedilmaeri_ (again
2808,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,in the same charter) that it had not. And what should we do with the
2809,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"earliest East Saxon charter (Birch, 81), in which the grantor is called"
2810,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"both _Oedelraedus_ and _Ho(di)lredus_? Again, it is clear that Bede"
2811,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,wrote his own name _Baeda_; but will anyone venture to hold that this
2812,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,represents the current pronunciation of his name in 731--or indeed for
2813,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,some half a century earlier? In personal names we must clearly allow
2814,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,for traditional orthography. The form _Irminredi_ may no doubt be used
2815,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"as evidence for the change _ǣ_ > _ē_, and similarly the form _Vuestan"
2816,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"ae_ may be used as evidence for the loss of _h_. But forms, especially"
2817,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"personal names, like _Velhisci_ and _Aedilmaeri_, which must long"
2818,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"have been in use, may very well show an antiquated orthography--one"
2819,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,which correctly represented the pronunciation of thirty or forty years
2820,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,previously. A single instance of such a kind is totally insufficient
2821,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,ground for supposing that the Kentish dialect treated postconsonantal
2822,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,and intervocalic _h_ differently.
2823,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,
2824,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,Next we must consider the date given for the loss of _h_ in Mercian
2825,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,and Northumbrian (p. 263 f.). I find some difficulty here in
2826,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,following Prof. Morsbach's line of argument. In Northumbrian there
2827,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"is, admittedly, no evidence at all for the preservation of _h_, while"
2828,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"cases of its omission are numerous in Bede's History (written in 731),"
2829,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,in addition to one or two instances in probably earlier authorities.
2830,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"For Mercian[98] we are dependent on the Epinal, Erfurt and Corpus"
2831,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"glossaries, the archetype of which is placed before 700 by Prof."
2832,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"Morsbach. In my _Studies_, p. 232, I came to the conclusion that"
2833,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,in this archetype the cases of retention and omission of _h_ were
2834,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,probably about equal in number. Prof. Morsbach replies that there is
2835,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"no necessity for such a conclusion, since all the extant glossaries"
2836,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,themselves date from times when _h_ was already lost. He himself
2837,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,decides[99] against the loss of _h_ in the archetype for two reasons:
2838,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,(1) because postconsonantal and intervocalic _h_ are treated alike in
2839,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,the glossaries and the former was still retained in Kentish when the
2840,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,archetype was written[100]; (2) because the assumption of such an early
2841,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,date for the loss of _h_ would be incompatible with his own date for
2842,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"the loss of _-u_. The first of these arguments, it will be seen, rests"
2843,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"upon the dating of the loss of postconsonantal _h_ in Kentish, on which"
2844,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,enough has been said above. The second depends upon a hypothesis which
2845,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,we shall have to consider presently.
2846,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,
2847,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,My reason for concluding that the loss of _h_ occurred in the archetype
2848,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,was that in at least eight entries (probably several more) all three
2849,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,glossaries agree in showing forms without _h_. It is to be remembered
2850,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,that in these glossaries we are dealing not with independent documents
2851,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"but with copies made, more or less mechanically, from one original."
2852,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,This remark applies of course much more to Epinal and Erfurt than to
2853,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"Corpus; for in the latter the materials have been rearranged, as well"
2854,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"as augmented from other sources, while incidentally the forms have been"
2855,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,modernised to a considerable extent. In Epinal such modernisation is
2856,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"not unknown, but it is restricted within very narrow limits, as may be"
2857,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"seen from the use of _b_ and _f_[101]. Further, it is to be remarked"
2858,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,that we have no ground for assuming the language of the archetype
2859,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,itself to have been consistent. The occurrence of numerous Dative
2860,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,forms and of expressions containing more than one word (e.g. _per
2861,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,anticipationem_--_þorch obst_) shows that the materials were derived
2862,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"largely from glosses in books, just as in the Leiden glossary[102]."
2863,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,Many of these glosses may have been written a generation or more
2864,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,earlier than the compilation of the archetype glossary. Whoever bears
2865,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,these facts in mind and at the same time compares the evidence for
2866,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"forms with and without _h_ with that for _f_ and _b_ will, I think,"
2867,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,be forced to the conclusion that the forms with _h_ do not represent
2868,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"the pronunciation of the compiler of the archetype, but that they were"
2869,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,taken over by him from earlier sources.
2870,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,
2871,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,Now we may take the evidence for the proposed date of the loss of
2872,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,_-u_. After enumerating (p. 253 ff.) a list of cases which have been
2873,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,suggested by various scholars Prof. Morsbach comes to the conclusion
2874,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,that the only certain example of a form in which _-u_ is retained[103]
2875,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,is the word _flodu_ in the inscription on the Franks casket. As the
2876,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,whole theory largely depends on the value attached to this form we must
2877,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"consider it carefully. In my _Studies_, p. 156, I suggested that it"
2878,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,should be regarded as an archaism and at the same time pointed out that
2879,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,_-u_ is lost in another word (_unneg_) in the same inscription. Prof.
2880,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"Morsbach rejects this explanation of _unneg_, which he connects,"
2881,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"rightly, I think now, with O. Sax. _nah_. But this form can come"
2882,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"perfectly well from *_nāh(w)u_ (earlier *_nēhwō_), if not from *_nāhwa_"
2883,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"(cf. Goth. _nehwa_, _nehw_). That Ang.-Sax. _neah_, _neh_ has lost"
2884,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"an _u_-sound is, I contend, shown not only by the Gothic forms, but"
2885,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"also by _neolaecan_ and _neowest_ (cf. Lind, _genehwaþ_, etc.). Prof."
2886,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,Morsbach rejects my explanation of these forms also and adopts that
2887,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"of Prof. Bülbring, as stated above. But the latter is untenable; for"
2888,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,if _ē_ (from _ā_) had come into existence before the operation of
2889,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"breaking, we should never find forms with _ae_, which as a matter"
2890,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,of fact are fairly common in the earliest texts of all dialects. In
2891,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,particular we may note that the three extant coins of the Mercian king
2892,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,Aethelred (675-704) all have _-ræd_. Hence the change _ǣ_ > _ē_ can
2893,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,hardly have taken place much before 650.
2894,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,
2895,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"Apart from _unneg_[104], there are three forms on the recently"
2896,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,discovered right side of the casket which may show loss of _-u_. Prof.
2897,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"Napier (_An English Miscellany_, p. 375 f.) is inclined to regard the"
2898,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"forms _sær_ and _dœn_ (?), if not also _hos_, as Nom. sg. fem. But the"
2899,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,interpretation of this part of the inscription is still uncertain in
2900,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,many details.
2901,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,
2902,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,I confess that since the discovery of the new side I am less inclined
2903,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,to regard the form _flodu_ as an archaism than as a mere blunder. Even
2904,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,in the more intelligible parts of the inscription we find a number of
2905,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"forms which present serious difficulty: _Romwalus_, _Reumwalus_[105],"
2906,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"_gasric_, _Giuþeasu_. The last of these still seems to me to present"
2907,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,the best illustration of _flodu_. If the one is due to the loss of
2908,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,some letters--e.g. _su_ for _su(mæ)_--the same may be the case with
2909,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,the other[106]. At all events an inscription which presents so many
2910,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,difficulties cannot be regarded as a safe authority on which to base a
2911,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,scheme for the chronology of sound-changes.
2912,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,
2913,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,The only other instance of _-u_ on which Prof. Morsbach lays any
2914,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,weight is the form _aetgaru_ in the Erfurt glossary. He speaks of
2915,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"it as 'nicht unwahrscheinlich' (p. 257), though 'fraglich' (p. 264)."
2916,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,Many scholars cite it as an example of_-u_ without reserve. Now in
2917,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,order to form a just estimate of the value of any form which occurs
2918,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,in the glossaries it is obviously necessary to take it in connection
2919,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,with the forms which the other texts show in the same entry. The entry
2920,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,in question (_framea_--_aetgaru_) occurs in the Epinal and Corpus
2921,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"glossaries, as well as in that of Erfurt, though the two former have"
2922,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,_aetgaeru_ (_ætgaeru_) for _aetgaru_. There can be no doubt that the
2923,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,relationship between the three glossaries is as follows:

2934,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,
2935,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,though we do not know exactly how many intermediate stages lie between
2936,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,the extant texts and the original archetype. It will be seen that the
2937,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,question at issue is whether the Erfurt glossary or the other two have
2938,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,kept the original form--for if the archetype had contained both forms
2939,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,we may assume that some trace of the double entry would have been
2940,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,preserved (as in other cases). Now the Erfurt glossary is the latest of
2941,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"the three, it is the work of a foreign scribe and it is very carelessly"
2942,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"copied. Moreover, no letter or combination of letters has suffered more"
2943,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,than _ae_. Most usually this combination has been reduced to _e_; but
2944,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"the loss of _e_ is not infrequent, e.g. _smal_, _hrad_, _nacthegelae_."
2945,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,In view of these facts it is unintelligible to me how anyone can
2946,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,uphold the evidence of the Erfurt glossary against the other two. But
2947,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,in this case it is used to prove the existence of an archaic form for
2948,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"which none of the glossaries elsewhere present a parallel. Lastly, we"
2949,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,may remark that though it is frequently assumed that the word _gar_
2950,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,was an _u_-stem (*_gaizu-_) no evidence worth consideration has ever
2951,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,been adduced to prove it[107]. On all grounds therefore we are brought
2952,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,to the conclusion that the evidence for the preservation of _-u_ in
2953,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,_aetgaru_ is not merely open to question but entirely worthless.
2954,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,
2955,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,We must now notice certain early documents in which _-u_ is clearly
2956,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,lost. Prof. Morsbach mentions the form _felt_ in the earliest East
2957,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"Saxon charter (Birch, 81), which dates from 692-3. Here then _-u_ was"
2958,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,lost before the date in question[108]. But we can get back further
2959,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"than this, for the place mentioned is called _Vuidmundes felt_. Some"
2960,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,considerable time must have elapsed after the loss of _-u_ before a

2966,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,may find an example in _Cyniburug_; for in view of _hnutu_ etc. it is
2967,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,probable that consonantal stems used what was originally the Accus.
2968,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,sg. form also for the Nom. sg. (as in Old Norse). I cannot see any
2969,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,probability in the suggestion that this monument may date from some
2970,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"considerable time after 670[109], if it has been rightly interpreted."
2971,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,
2972,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,More important is the fact that no example of _-u_ after a long
2973,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,syllable is preserved in Bede's Ecclesiastical History. It is to
2974,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,be observed that Bede seems to have scrupulously followed the
2975,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,orthographical peculiarities of the documents which he used. Thus
2976,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,in Papal letters dating from the first half of the seventh century
2977,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"we find such forms as _Adilbercto_, _Audubaldi_ which are not used"
2978,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,elsewhere in the work[110]. Now in the record of the proceedings at
2979,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"the Council of Hertford in 673, which is quoted in IV 5, we find the"
2980,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"forms _Herutford_, _Vilfrid_, _Vynfrid_, _Hrofaescaestir_; and in the"
2981,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"similar record for the Council of Hatfield in 680, quoted in IV 17,"
2982,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,we find the form _Haethfelth_. If_-u_ had not been lost by this time
2983,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"the forms used must have been _-fordu_ or _-fordus_, _Vilfridu(s)_,"
2984,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"etc., and it is most unlikely, in view of Bede's practice elsewhere,"
2985,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,that he would have altered them. As a matter of fact the latter of
2986,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,these documents contains two forms--_Hymbronensium_ (or _Humbr-_) and
2987,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"_Estranglorum_--which are not used elsewhere by Bede. Again, the same"
2988,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,author almost always writes the name of the Northumbrian king Ecgfrith
2989,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,(r. 671-685) as _Ecgfrid_ (in the Nom.). That this represents the
2990,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,contemporary orthography is shown by a coin of that king which bears
2991,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,the legend _Ecgfrid rex_.
2992,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,
2993,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"But further, there is a whole series of names, much used in"
2994,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"Northumbria, which have as their second element _-haeþ_ from earlier"
2995,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,_-haþu_ (e.g. _Eadhaed_). At the time when _-u_ was lost here the
2996,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,change _a_ > _æ_ was clearly still operative. Will anyone suggest that
2997,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"this was the case after the middle of the seventh century? Again, it"
2998,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"can hardly be doubted that the form _Osuiu_, if not also _Osuald_,"
2999,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,represents the pronunciation[111] current in the time of that king. In
3000,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"Bede's History, III 29, we have extracts from a Papal letter addressed"
3001,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,to _Osuiu_ (v. l. _Osuio_) _regi Saxonum_. The form _os-_ can scarcely

3004,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,
3005,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,It is surely unnecessary to enter into further details. We have seen
3006,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,that practically the whole evidence for the proposed chronology
3007,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"consists of two forms, _Velhisci_ and _flodu_, one of which is"
3008,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"incapable of proving what it is meant to prove, while the other is of"
3009,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,exceedingly doubtful value; and on the other hand that this chronology
3010,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"has opposed to it a large number of forms in the glossaries, in"
3011,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,charters and in early Northumbrian authorities of various kinds. Now
3012,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,let us consider the various sound-changes in relation to one another.
3013,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,
3014,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"It is admitted, and necessarily so, that the loss of _-u_ took place"
3015,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,before the loss of _h_. For the sake of convenience we may apply the
3016,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,terms 'Period I' to times anterior to the loss of _-u_ and 'Period
3017,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,II' to the interval between the two changes. From neither of these
3018,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"periods have we any texts surviving, unless we are to reckon the"
3019,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"inscription on the Franks casket to Period I. Our earliest charters,"
3020,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"and apparently also the lost archetype of the glossaries, were composed"
3021,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"at a later time ('Period III') when _h_ was no longer pronounced,"
3022,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,though doubtless often written. But before the date of the earliest
3023,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,extant glossary (Epinal) a further change or changes had taken place
3024,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,which brought about the confusion of original _ƀ_ and _f_. It is clear
3025,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,from a comparison of the glossaries that this confusion was later than
3026,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"the loss of _h_ and also that it was almost, if not entirely, unknown"
3027,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,to the archetype. So also in Northumbrian. In Bede's History we have
3028,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"no instance of _h_ preserved in an English word, whereas examples of"
3029,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,its omission are numerous. On the other hand it is clear that Bede
3030,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"usually retained the distinction between _b_ (i.e. _ƀ_) and _f_,"
3031,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,although the latter has already largely encroached on the former in
3032,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,the Moore MS.[112] We may therefore constitute two subdivisions of the
3033,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"period subsequent to the loss of _h_, namely 'Period III' prior to the"
3034,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,confusion of _ƀ_ and _f_ and 'Period IV' subsequent to this confusion.
3035,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"Now we can see clearly where to date the Franks casket, for it shows"
3036,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,confusion of _ƀ_ and _f_ in _wylif_--according to Prof. Morsbach also
3037,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,in _sefu_. It belongs therefore not to Period I but to Period IV.
3038,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,
3039,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,Any attempt to fix an absolute chronology is of course rendered
3040,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,difficult by the absence of very early texts. We may probably assume
3041,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,that Period IV begins more or less about 700. The Kentish charter
3042,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"of 679 falls in Period III. Now when _-u_ was lost, _h_ (whether"
3043,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,intervocalic or postconsonantal) must have been a spirant--a fact which
3044,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,Prof. Morsbach seems to have entirely ignored. It is quite incredible
3045,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,that only a few years should elapse between that stage and the total
3046,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,loss of intervocalic _h_ seen in the charter. The corresponding period
3047,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,"in Germany lasted centuries, and I cannot conceive how the transition"
3048,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,can have been accomplished anywhere in less than half a century. I
3049,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,conclude therefore that the dates which I gave in my Studies were
3050,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,approximately correct. If there was an error it was in putting some
3051,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,of the changes slightly too late. I have little hesitation now in
3052,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,expressing my opinion that the loss of _-u_ took place not later than
3053,NOTE II. ON THE DATING OF CERTAIN SOUND-CHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON.,the second or third decade of the seventh century.

3131,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,
3132,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,I am not aware that any serious argument has been brought forward
3133,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,to show that Beowulf was a literary production. It is customary
3134,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"indeed, especially among English scholars, to use the word 'write'"
3135,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,with reference to its composition; but this is frequently due to
3136,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,mere carelessness. Nevertheless there is undoubtedly a widespread
3137,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,reluctance to admit that the poem came into existence without the
3138,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,use of writing--partly on account of its length and partly because
3139,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,its technique is of rather an advanced order. The first of these
3140,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"difficulties has now been definitely settled by the Servian poems, as"
3141,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,we shall see in the next Note. Here we need concern ourselves only with
3142,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,the second.
3143,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,
3144,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,The most definite pronouncement on this subject known to me is
3145,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"contained in Prof. Ker's book, _The Dark Ages_, p. 250. ""_Beowulf_"
3146,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"and _Waldere_,"" he says, ""are the work of educated men, and they were"
3147,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"intended, no doubt, as books to read. They are not, like the _Elder"
3148,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"Edda_, a collection of traditional oral poems."" Here we have three"
3149,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,distinct statements. That Beowulf and Waldhere are not a collection of
3150,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"poems, like the Edda, is manifest. Whether they are traditional oral"
3151,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"poems at all is a different question, the answer to which depends in"
3152,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,the first place on our attitude to Prof. Ker's second statement--that
3153,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,they were intended as books to read. But this statement surely requires
3154,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"some evidence. The only argument brought forward is that ""the _Beowulf_"
3155,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"MS ... is intended as a book to be read, and is got up with some care."
3156,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"From the look of it, one places it naturally in the library of a great"
3157,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,house or a monastic school; and the contents of it have the same sort
3158,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,of association; they do not belong to the unlearned in their present
3159,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"form."" But, so far as the earlier part of this passage goes, the"
3160,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,argument applies only to the tenth century. No one will deny that the
3161,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,earlier Anglo-Saxon poems were studied at that time; indeed they had
3162,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"probably come to be regarded as, in a sense, classical. But have we"
3163,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,any right to assume that scholars of the seventh or eighth centuries
3164,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,viewed these poems or their subjects in a similar light? If so how are
3165,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,we to account for the total absence of references to such subjects in
3166,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,the works of Bede? And what about Alcuin? _Quid Hinieldus cum Christo?_
3167,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,Is it likely that Alcuin would have regarded these _pagani et perditi
3168,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,reges_ as suitable subjects for the attention of scholars? The natural
3169,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,presumption from his language is that he knew of them not from literary
3170,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"works, but only from street-minstrels whom he looked upon with disgust."
3171,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,Yet Bede and Alcuin can hardly have been ignorant of any important
3172,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"literary activity during their times, and it would be unfair to regard"
3173,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,them merely as religious bigots. In view of their silence it seems
3174,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,to me a precarious hypothesis even that the poems were committed to
3175,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,writing much before the end of the eighth century.
3176,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,
3177,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,There is no doubt of course that the writing of English was in common
3178,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,use during the early part of the ninth century. But the paucity of
3179,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,earlier evidence renders it probable that this was a recent innovation;
3180,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,and the orthographical characteristics of eighth century documents
3181,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,point to the same conclusion. Laws were written in English from the
3182,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,beginning; but we may safely assume that this was done by professional
3183,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"scribes, in all probability ecclesiastics. Otherwise there is little"
3184,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"definite evidence for the writing of the vernacular, except of course"
3185,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,in glosses. The more learned clergy clearly preferred to use Latin;
3186,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"for the less learned Bede states (_Ep. ad Ecgb._, cap. 5) that he had"
3187,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,himself had to make translations even of the Creed and the Lord's
3188,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"Prayer, for them to learn by heart. Where was a reading public to be"
3189,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,looked for in such a period[113]?
3190,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,
3191,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"But we have yet to discuss the statement that ""_Beowulf_ and _Waldere_"
3192,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"are the work of educated men."" The question here is what is meant by"
3193,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,the word 'educated.' Nowadays the expression 'educated Chinese' is
3194,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,used in more than one sense. Sometimes it is applied to those who have
3195,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,received a good education according to the traditional standard of
3196,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"that nation. Sometimes however, especially in newspaper language, it"
3197,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,is used only of those Chinese who have received a Western education.
3198,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,We need not doubt that the poets of Beowulf and Waldhere were among
3199,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,the best educated men of their day according to the traditional native
3200,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,standard. If they were court minstrels--a question we shall have to
3201,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,discuss in the next chapter--they could hardly be otherwise. But this
3202,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,is not what Prof. Ker means. The education which he has in view is of
3203,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"foreign (Roman) type, as may be seen by the latter part of the second"
3204,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"of the quotations given above. Again (p. 252) he says: ""The English"
3205,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,epic is possibly due to Virgil and Statius; possibly to Juvencus
3206,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"and other Christian poets, to the authors studied by Aldhelm and"
3207,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"Bede."" If so[114], is it not remarkable that no obvious trace of such"
3208,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,influence can be pointed out? It must not be assumed that the poets
3209,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,responsible for the composition or preservation of Beowulf would have
3210,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,any inclination to disguise their knowledge of foreign poetry. The use
3211,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,which they have made of incidents derived from the Bible is decisive
3212,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"evidence to the contrary, although their knowledge of this subject"
3213,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,seems to have been of a most elementary description. In Widsith we
3214,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,actually have at least one reference to a classical character (v. 15
3215,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,ff.). But Beowulf is entirely free from anything of the kind.
3216,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,
3217,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,Prof. Brandl[115] has likewise been attracted by the idea that the
3218,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,growth of Anglo-Saxon epic poetry may have been due to Latin models.
3219,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,As a probable source of such influence he has fixed upon the Aeneid
3220,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,and even indicated a number of passages in this poem which may have
3221,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,suggested certain scenes and incidents in Beowulf. Thus he notes that
3222,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"both poems begin with the story of a wanderer (Scyld, Aeneas) who came"
3223,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"over the sea (_feasceaft_, _primus et profugus_) and founded a great"
3224,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,dynasty or empire. Then he suggests a connection between the song of
3225,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,Hrothgar's minstrel on the Creation (Beow. 90 ff.) and a passage (Aen.
3226,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,I 742 ff.) which describes how Dido's minstrel Iopas sang of the origin
3227,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"of men and beasts, among other cosmological subjects. Further, he"
3228,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,compares the whole of the scene which contains the latter passage with
3229,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"the account of Beowulf's reception at Heorot, noting the various stages"
3230,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,in the arrival of the two heroes from their disembarkation to the feast
3231,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"with which they are welcomed in the palaces. Incidentally, he remarks"
3232,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,that at the feast Wealhtheow hands the cup to Hrothgar and then to the
3233,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"visitors (Beow. 615 ff.), while Dido pays the same honour to Bitias"
3234,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"(Aen. I 738). Lastly, he compares the racing after Grendel's overthrow"
3235,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,(Beow. 864 ff.) with the rowing contest in memory of Anchises (Aen. V
3236,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,104 ff.).
3237,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,
3238,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"I confess that, coming as they do towards the close of an admirable"
3239,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"discussion of the subject, which no attentive student of Beowulf"
3240,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"can fail to appreciate, the comparisons suggested by Prof. Brandl"
3241,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,strike me as surprising beyond measure. The resemblances between the
3242,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"athletic contests, so far as they have any existence at all, are due to"
3243,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,practices which are worldwide. Is there any reason for supposing that
3244,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,the act of courtesy ascribed to Wealhtheow was not in full accordance
3245,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"with early Teutonic custom? Parallels may be found, easily enough, in"
3246,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"Old Norse literature. The arrival of the wanderer (Scyld, not Beowulf)"
3247,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,has nothing in common with that of Aeneas. The one is a baby and
3248,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"probably alone; the other is the commander of a fleet. Then, as to"
3249,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,the resemblance between Beowulf's visit to Hrothgar and Aeneas' visit
3250,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"to Dido, I can only say that I fail to detect its existence. Prof."
3251,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,Brandl seems to lay most stress on this incident and points out certain
3252,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,parallelisms in the language: _corripuere uiam qua semita monstrat_
3253,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"(Aen. I 418) with _stig wisode gumum aetgaedere_ (Beow. 320 f.),"
3254,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,and _coram quem quaeritis adsum Troius Aeneas_ (Aen. I 595 f.) with
3255,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,_Beowulf is min nama_ (Beow. 343). But are these not purely accidental
3256,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"coincidences, such as one could find between almost any two narrative"
3257,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"poems? When Prof. Brandl speaks of Aeneas' ""Verhandlung mit Dido zuerst"
3258,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"durch eine etikettegemässe Mittelsperson"", I do not understand what is"
3259,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,meant. Certainly this description applies to the entry of Beowulf. But
3260,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"Aeneas is present beforehand, shrouded in a cloud with which Venus has"
3261,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,covered him. In the midst of the scene the cloud is suddenly parted and
3262,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,Aeneas disclosed to Dido's eyes. It seems to me that no meeting could
3263,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,well be more different. There remains then only the fact that the two
3264,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,minstrels treat a somewhat similar theme (though in Beowulf this does
3265,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,not take place on the occasion of the hero's arrival). It is no doubt a
3266,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,curious coincidence; but the introduction of such a subject in Beowulf
3267,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,may be accounted for quite satisfactorily without the hypothesis of any
3268,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,acquaintance with Virgil.
3269,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,
3270,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,I cannot quit this subject without remarking how much more plausible
3271,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"a case could be made out for deriving Beowulf from the Homeric poems,"
3272,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,especially the Odyssey. Here there are striking parallels both in
3273,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"diction and terminology, as we shall see in a later chapter. We may"
3274,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,note especially the epithets applied to princes and the formulae with
3275,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,which speeches are introduced. If we wish to find a real parallel to
3276,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"the reception of Beowulf by Hrothgar, it is provided by the account of"
3277,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,Telemachos' visit to Menelaos. Similar parallels are to be obtained
3278,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,for the minstrel's lays and many other incidents. Are we then to
3279,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,suppose that Beowulf is based upon the Odyssey? That is a hypothesis
3280,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,which I will gladly leave for others to work out. For my own part I
3281,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"prefer the explanation that similar poetry is the outcome, or rather"
3282,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"the expression, of similar social conditions. But in Beowulf and"
3283,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"the Homeric poems, as against the Aeneid, we have additional common"
3284,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,elements in the fact that the interest is centred in the actual
3285,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,characters--not in the destiny of their descendants--and in the
3286,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"vividness and reality of the narratives, in spite of Grendel, Scylla"
3287,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,and the rest. The latter of these two common features seems to me to
3288,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,indicate that both the Greek and English poets were depicting types
3289,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"of life with which they were themselves familiar, whereas no one will"
3290,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,dispute that the Aeneid is a product of the library.
3291,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,
3292,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"Half a century ago, when the study of Teutonic antiquity was still"
3293,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"young, there was a general eagerness to refer every institution and"
3294,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,belief to a native origin. To-day we see the inevitable reaction--a
3295,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"hypercritical attitude towards every explanation of this character,"
3296,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,coupled with a readiness to accept theories of biblical or classical
3297,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,influence on the slightest possible evidence. It is this intellectual
3298,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"atmosphere which, naturally enough, has given birth to the chimaera of"
3299,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,"a literary Beowulf--a creature which, if I am not mistaken, belongs to"
3300,NOTE III. LITERARY INFLUENCE IN BEOWULF.,the same genus as certain well-known theories in Northern mythology.

3327,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3328,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3329,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,In the preceding chapters we have seen that the persons and events
3330,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,celebrated in the heroic poems apparently all belonged to the
3331,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"fourth, fifth or sixth centuries, and further that heroic poetry was"
3332,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,flourishing among the Goths during the same period. For the existence
3333,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"of English, Scandinavian or German heroic poetry at this time we have"
3334,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,no absolutely conclusive evidence. But the materials from which our
3335,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,poems are formed must largely be referred to the sixth century. This
3336,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,may be seen most clearly in cases where the poems of two or more
3337,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,nations not merely treat an identical theme but also agree in the
3338,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"motif or in comparatively small details, as in the stories of Ingeld,"
3339,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,Waldhere and Svanhildr. A like age is probably to be attributed
3340,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"to resemblances in language, such as those shown by the hortatory"
3341,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,addresses and the accounts of dragon-fights cited in the last chapter
3342,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,(p. 60 f.). The fact that these resemblances sometimes occur in stories
3343,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,relating to entirely different characters need not prevent us from
3344,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,believing that they spring ultimately from a common origin.
3345,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3346,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,It cannot of course be proved that the materials from which the heroic
3347,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,poems are derived were themselves always in poetic (metrical) form. In
3348,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,principle we must admit the possibility that they were transmitted from
3349,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,one generation to another in a more or less stereotyped form of prose
3350,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"narrative, such as we find later in the sagas of Iceland and Ireland."
3351,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,But in point of fact we have no evidence whatever for the cultivation
3352,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,of such traditional prose narratives among any of the early Teutonic
3353,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"peoples, whereas there is good reason, as we shall see shortly, for"
3354,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,believing that narrative poetry was both ancient and widely cultivated.
3355,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3356,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,In the first place we may note that English and German poetry down
3357,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,to the ninth century shared a common system of metre and that the
3358,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"Fornyrðislag, which is used in most of the Edda poems, differed but"
3359,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"little from this type, except of course that it was always arranged in"
3360,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,strophes. The application of this common metre to narrative purposes
3361,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"can scarcely be regarded as a recent innovation, for English and"
3362,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,German poems frequently exhibit verses and half-verses of very similar
3363,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,construction. Thus in the Hildebrandslied speeches are generally
3364,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"introduced with the formula: _Hadubrant gimahalta, Hiltibrantes sunu_,"
3365,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,which is almost identical with a formula used in Beowulf: _Wiglaf
3366,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"maðelode, Weohstanes sunu_. In the same German poem (v. 42) we find the"
3367,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"verse: _dat sagetun mi seolidante_ ('it has been told me by mariners'),"
3368,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,with which we may compare Beow. 377: _þonne saegdon þaet saeliðende_.
3369,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,Note should also be taken of such phrases as (v. 55) _ibu dir din
3370,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,ellen taoc_ ('if thy prowess is sufficient') and definitely poetical
3371,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"expressions like (v. 43) _inan wic furnam_ ('war carried him off'),"
3372,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,as compared with Beow. 572 _ðonne his ellen deah_ and 1080 _wig ealle
3373,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,fornam Finnes þegnas_. The number of such parallels might be greatly
3374,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,increased if we were to take into account passages from religious
3375,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"poems, especially the Old Saxon Heliand."
3376,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3377,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,For a very much earlier period direct evidence is furnished by the
3378,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"Roman historian Tacitus, who says (_Germ._ 2) that the Germani"
3379,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,possessed ancient poems or songs (_carmina_) even in his time and adds
3380,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,expressly that they had no other means of preserving a historical
3381,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,record[116]. That these poems were partly of what may be called a
3382,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"'heroic' character is clear from another passage (_Ann._ II 88),"
3383,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,where it is stated that Arminius was still a subject of poetry among
3384,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,barbarian nations (_canitur ... adhuc barbaras apud gentes_). In both
3385,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,cases the reference is in all probability to the peoples of western
3386,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,Germany rather than to the Goths.
3387,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3388,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,On the whole then we need not doubt that the heroic poetry which we
3389,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,find in England and Germany during the seventh and eighth centuries
3390,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,had a long history behind it. Of course as to the form of the poetry
3391,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,current in the first century we are entirely without information. Many
3392,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"scholars hold that it was exclusively choric, not only in Tacitus' time"
3393,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,but for four or five centuries later. This is one of the questions
3394,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,which we shall have to bear in mind in the course of our discussion.

3397,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3398,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"The earliest historical reference to the cultivation of poetry, or"
3399,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"rather perhaps minstrelsy, in England occurs in Bede's account of the"
3400,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,poet Caedmon (_Hist. Eccl._ IV 24). In this story we are told that
3401,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"it was the custom that, when the villagers met together to drink and"
3402,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"amuse themselves, everyone should take his turn in singing to the harp."
3403,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"Caedmon, who had never been able to learn a song, used to leave the"
3404,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,festivities and make his way home as soon as he saw the harp coming
3405,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,in his direction[117]. No information is given as to the character of
3406,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,these songs. Probably they would as a rule be quite short--perhaps not
3407,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"much longer than the hymn learned by Caedmon from the angel, which"
3408,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,contains only nine verses. It is not unlikely that they resembled
3409,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,some of the metrical riddles more than any other form of Anglo-Saxon
3410,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"poetry which has come down to us. Longer songs, of a narrative type,"
3411,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,may of course have been known. But it is a question whether such songs
3412,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,would deal with heroic themes or with folk-tales. We may think of the
3413,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"Scandinavian story of Svipdagr and Menglöð, which is preserved in a"
3414,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"number of different versions, ranging in date probably from the tenth"
3415,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,century to the seventeenth or later.
3416,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3417,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,But we have already seen (p. 41 f.) that in the eighth century at
3418,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,least the recitation of heroic poetry was by no means unknown. Indeed
3419,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,we may infer from the language used by Alcuin (_ridentium turuam in
3420,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,plateis_) that it enjoyed a good deal of favour with the general
3421,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,public. Another of his letters[118] speaks to much the same effect.
3422,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,We may gather from the use of the word _citharista_ that these
3423,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,recitations also were accompanied by the harp. But the language of the
3424,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,letters seems rather to suggest that the performers in such cases were
3425,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,persons who made minstrelsy more or less of a profession. A century
3426,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,earlier the existence of professional minstrels may be inferred from
3427,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,the well-known story of Aldhelm[119]--that he used to take up his
3428,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"position on a bridge, like a professional minstrel (_quasi artem"
3429,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"cantitandi professum_), and sing to the people in order to call them"
3430,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,back to church. We are not informed as to the character of the poems
3431,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"he recited, but clearly they were of a type calculated to attract the"
3432,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,country people.
3433,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3434,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,On the Continent we find very similar evidence. A passage in the Annals
3435,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"of Quedlinburg, to which we have already alluded and which dates"
3436,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"perhaps ultimately from the tenth century, states that the country"
3437,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,people used to sing of Dietrich von Bern[120]. From a much earlier
3438,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,period we have an interesting reference to a Frisian minstrel named
3439,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"Bernlef, who became a disciple of St Liudger. He had been blind for"
3440,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"three years, when he was brought to the missionary, but ""he was greatly"
3441,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,loved by his neighbours because of his geniality and his skill in
3442,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,reciting to the accompaniment of the harp stories of the deeds of the
3443,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"ancients and the wars of kings[121]."" This incident appears to have"
3444,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,taken place before 785. That minstrelsy was definitely recognised as a
3445,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,profession among the Frisians is shown by the last clause in the Lex
3446,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"Frisonum, which fixes a special compensation for injury to the hand of"
3447,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,a harpist[122].
3448,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3449,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,From all this we gather that in the eighth century there existed both
3450,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,in England and Germany a class of minstrels whose practice it was to
3451,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,play the harp and recite heroic poetry in the village-streets or on
3452,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,bridges or wherever they could gather an audience. Now if we turn to
3453,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,the poems themselves we find that they also contain references to
3454,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,professional minstrels; but these appear to have been quite a different
3455,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,class of persons from those with whom we have been dealing.
3456,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3457,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,At the close of his elegy (v. 35 ff.) Deor gives the following account
3458,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"of himself: ""With regard to myself I will say that formerly I was the"
3459,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,bard (_scop_) of the Heodeningas and dear to my lord. My name is Deor.
3460,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,For many years I have had a good office and a gracious master. But now
3461,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"Heorrenda, a skilful poet, has received the domain which the king had"
3462,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"before given to me."" There may be some difference of opinion as to the"
3463,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"precise meaning of the word _londryht_[123], but it is clear enough"
3464,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,that the poet had been a court-minstrel and that he had been supplanted
3465,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,in the king's favour by a rival. In Beowulf also we find mention of a
3466,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,person who seems to hold a similar position. The word _scop_ occurs
3467,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"three times in this poem (vv. 90, 496, 1066)--always perhaps with"
3468,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,reference to the same man. In each case he is represented as singing or
3469,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"reciting, and twice mention is made of the harp. On the last occasion,"
3470,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"when he recites the story of Finn and Hnaef at the banquet (cf. p. 2),"
3471,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"he is called _Hroðgares scop_, which seems to imply a sort of official"
3472,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,position.
3473,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3474,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,The case of Widsith is somewhat different. The poet is a traveller
3475,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,who prides himself on the large number of nations he has visited. He
3476,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,states also that he served under various princes by whom he had been
3477,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,handsomely rewarded. The poem ends with some reflections on the life
3478,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"of wandering minstrels; but these verses may be a later addition, like"
3479,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,the introduction. At all events in v. 94 the poet speaks of his return
3480,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"home, when he presented to his lord, Eadgils prince of the Myrgingas,"
3481,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,a valuable 'ring' which had been given him by Eormenric. This present
3482,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,was a reward to Eadgils for his kindness in granting the poet the
3483,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,land formerly held by his father. It would seem then that the poet is
3484,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,represented as a man of good position. Whether we describe him as a
3485,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"wandering minstrel or not, his occupation is clearly to be regarded as"
3486,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,court-minstrelsy and different therefore from that of Bernlef and the
3487,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,harpists mentioned by Alcuin.
3488,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3489,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,Apart from these personal notices there can be little doubt that
3490,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,the heroic poems which have come down to us were of courtly and not
3491,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,of popular origin. In the first place we may note their strongly
3492,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,aristocratic tone. This may be appreciated from the fact that all the
3493,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"women mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon poems are of royal birth, while the"
3494,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"men are either princes or persons, apparently of noble or knightly"
3495,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"rank, attached to the retinues of princes. On the rare occasions when"
3496,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"persons of humbler rank are referred to, their names are not mentioned."
3497,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,In Beowulf no name is given even to the court-minstrel. Again the poems
3498,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"frequently refer to details of court etiquette, with which they seem"
3499,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,to be well acquainted. In the later German poems this feature must of
3500,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,course be attributed to the conditions of the twelfth and thirteenth
3501,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"centuries, when the poems were composed. But it is quite as marked even"
3502,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,in Beowulf. We may note especially the long and detailed account of
3503,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,Beowulf's arrival at the Danish king's hall and the conversation which
3504,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,the chamberlain holds with the king on the one hand and the visitor on
3505,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"the other, before the latter is invited to enter. The chamberlain's"
3506,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"exact position is remarked, when he approaches the king and it is added"
3507,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"that ""he knew the custom of knighthood[124]."" Other members of the"
3508,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"court also have their position or duties described (vv. 500 f., 1161"
3509,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"f., 1165 f., 1794 ff.); but most of all the poet loves to picture the"
3510,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"movements of the king and queen (vv. 612 ff., 920 ff., 1162 f.)."
3511,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3512,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,Then again it should be observed that persons of royal rank are very
3513,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,seldom spoken of with disrespect. The rare exceptions to this rule
3514,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"probably all refer to persons of a remote past, Eormenric, Thrytho"
3515,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"and Heremod, and in the last two cases the reprobation is qualified"
3516,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,in a very marked way. Moreover the ground of censure is invariably
3517,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"violence, cruelty or treachery. Of immoral or unseemly conduct we have"
3518,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"no mention. Indeed, except in the story of Weland--which stands by"
3519,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"itself in many ways, as we shall see later--such subjects seem to be"
3520,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,studiously avoided. More than this the Anglo-Saxon heroic poems are
3521,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"entirely free from coarseness of language, such as we frequently find"
3522,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"in Saxo's history, and indeed from references of any kind which could"
3523,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,offend even the most fastidious taste. In general the same remarks are
3524,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"true also of the German and Scandinavian heroic poems, though not in"
3525,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,the same degree. But the gnomic and theological poems of the Edda show
3526,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"a wholly different tone, which at its worst (e.g. in Lokasenna) verges"
3527,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,on bestiality.
3528,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3529,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"Lastly, we must not overlook the fact that in dignity and polish of"
3530,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,style the heroic poems far surpass any narrative works which the
3531,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,English language has to offer for many centuries later. It has been
3532,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,remarked that the composition of epic poetry requires a more or less
3533,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"professional training, and in the case of such poems as Beowulf this"
3534,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"is doubtless true, not only on account of its length but also because"
3535,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,a very large vocabulary is needed for the constant interchange of
3536,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"epithets which is one of its chief characteristics, while the allusions"
3537,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,with which it abounds point to the possession of much historical or
3538,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,traditional lore[125]. At the time when it was produced the knowledge
3539,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,and leisure necessary for such composition is scarcely likely to have
3540,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,been found outside the entourages of kings.
3541,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3542,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,On the other hand we have seen that minstrelsy of some kind was
3543,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,cultivated even by peasants in Caedmon's time. We can hardly doubt
3544,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,that such was the case to a higher degree in court circles. In Beow.
3545,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,867 ff. we find a 'king's thegn' composing an account of the hero's
3546,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"adventure immediately after its occurrence, and utilising apparently"
3547,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,by way of illustration the story of Sigemund. This person may be the
3548,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,court minstrel; but the identity of the two is scarcely certain. In
3549,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"a later passage (v. 2105 ff.), referring to the banquet after the"
3550,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"fight with Grendel, we hear of the king himself taking his turn with"
3551,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"the harp: ""There we had poetry and music. The old Scylding (Hrothgar)"
3552,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,related stories of old time out of his great store of information.
3553,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"Now the martial[126] hero would lay his hands on the joyous harp,"
3554,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"the instrument that makes good cheer; now he would recite a poem,"
3555,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,true but sad; now a story of marvel would be related in due course by
3556,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"the magnanimous king. Now again, bowed with age as he was, the old"
3557,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,warrior would begin to lament that he had lost the martial vigour of
3558,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,youth. His heart surged within him as he called to mind the manifold
3559,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"experiences of a long life."" It is held that the reference here is"
3560,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,to lyrical effusions rather than to anything in the nature of epic
3561,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,narrative[127]; but I am inclined to doubt if we are justified in
3562,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,totally excluding the latter. I would rather favour the view that the
3563,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"cultivation of minstrelsy, including narrative as well as lyric poetry,"
3564,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"was a general accomplishment in royal households, and that the office"
3565,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,of court-minstrel was an honour given to that member of the court who
3566,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,had attained the greatest proficiency in his art.
3567,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3568,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,*       *       *       *       *
3569,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3570,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,The statements of the poems as to the prevalence of court-minstrelsy
3571,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,during the Heroic Age are fully confirmed by the testimony of
3572,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,contemporary Roman writers. Perhaps the most important reference is
3573,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,a passage in Priscus' account of his visit to Attila in the year
3574,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,448. After describing the banquet given by the king to his guests he
3575,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"proceeds as follows[128]: ""When evening came on torches were lighted"
3576,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,and two barbarians stepped forth in front of Attila and recited poems
3577,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"which they had composed, recounting his victories and his valiant deeds"
3578,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"in war. The banqueters fixed their eyes upon them, some being charmed"
3579,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"with the poems, while others were roused in spirit, as the recollection"
3580,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"of their wars came back to them. Others again burst into tears, because"
3581,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,their bodies were enfeebled by age and their martial ardour had
3582,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"perforce to remain unsatisfied."""
3583,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3584,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,It will be noticed that this account bears a curious resemblance to the
3585,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,passage from Beowulf which we have just quoted. Nothing is said as to
3586,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"the language in which the poems were composed[129], but at all events"
3587,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,we need hardly doubt that in this as in other respects Attila was
3588,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,following Gothic custom. For the duet we find an interesting parallel
3589,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"in a passage of Widsith (v. 103 ff.): ""Then Scilling and I began to"
3590,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,sing with clear voices before our victorious lord; loudly rang out
3591,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,our music as we played the harp. Then it was openly confessed by many
3592,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,brave-hearted and experienced men that they had never heard a better
3593,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"song."""
3594,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3595,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,Evidence for the cultivation of minstrelsy at Teutonic courts in Gaul
3596,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"is furnished by letters of Cassiodorus (_Variarum_ II, 40 f.) and"
3597,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"Sidonius Apollinaris (_Ep._ I, 2). The former document is an answer"
3598,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"from the Ostrogothic king Theodric to a request from Clovis, king of"
3599,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"the Franks (d. 511), who had asked him to send him a skilled minstrel."
3600,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"Sidonius' letter is a very full account of Theodric II, king of the"
3601,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"Visigoths, who reigned from 453 to 466. He states that the king seldom"
3602,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"admitted jesters when he was dining, and that he took no pleasure in"
3603,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,music except when it encouraged manliness of spirit as well as pleased
3604,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,the ear. In neither of these cases however is it certain that the
3605,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,performers were Goths.
3606,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3607,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"A clearer case of Teutonic minstrelsy, dating from the same period,"
3608,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"occurs in one of Sidonius' poems (_Carm._ 12[130]), in which the"
3609,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,author complains that he has to live among troops of longhaired and
3610,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"greedy Burgundians, listening with polite attention, in spite of his"
3611,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"disgust, to their songs. More than a century later we hear of Frankish"
3612,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,court-minstrelsy in a neighbouring district. In a poem addressed to
3613,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"Lupus, duke of Aquitaine, about the year 580, Venantius Fortunatus"
3614,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"(_Carm._ VII 8. 61) says: ""Let the Roman sound your praise with his"
3615,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"lyre and the barbarian with his harp[131]""; and again: ""Let us frame"
3616,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"verses for you, while barbarian poets compose their lays; thus the hero"
3617,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"will be greeted with like honour, though in diverse strains[132]."""
3618,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,In the introduction to his poems the same author complains of the
3619,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"constant buzzing of the harp, as it resounds to the barbarian lays[133]."
3620,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3621,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,A curious case of royal minstrelsy is recorded by Procopius (_Vand._
3622,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"II 6) in his account of the siege of Mount Pappua (A.D. 534). Gelimer,"
3623,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"king of the Vandals, wrote a letter to Faras, the Herulian chief who"
3624,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"commanded the besieging army, begging him to send him a harp, a loaf"
3625,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,and a sponge. The explanation given by the messenger was that the king
3626,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,had composed a song upon his misfortunes and as he was a good minstrel
3627,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,he was anxious to accompany it with a mournful tune on the harp as he
3628,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"bewailed his fate[134]. We are again reminded of Hrothgar, but perhaps"
3629,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,still more of Hrethel's dirge over his son (Beow. 2460 f.).
3630,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3631,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,These examples are sufficient to show that minstrelsy was widely
3632,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,cultivated in the courts of the Teutonic princes who had established
3633,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,themselves in Roman territory. Taken together with the references
3634,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"in Anglo-Saxon poetry, which deals of course with the more northern"
3635,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"peoples, they leave no doubt that the prevalence of court-minstrelsy"
3636,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,was one of the characteristics of the Heroic Age. For the existence of
3637,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"professional minstrels the Roman evidence is not so clear, though we"
3638,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,may regard in this light the two 'barbarians' mentioned by Priscus (p.
3639,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,84). On the whole the impression which we gain from our authorities
3640,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,is that the cultivation of the art was more or less general as in the
3641,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,north.
3642,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3643,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,But it must certainly not be assumed that the poems of the period were
3644,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"always of an ephemeral character. Jordanes (cap. 5), in a passage to"
3645,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"which we have already referred, says that the Goths ""used to sing"
3646,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,to the strains of the harp ancient poetry dealing with the deeds of
3647,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"their ancestors, Eterparmara, Hanala, Fridigernus, Vidigoia and others"
3648,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"who are very famous in this nation[135]."" Again, when he mentions"
3649,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"the migration of the Goths to the Black Sea (cap. 4), he refers"
3650,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"to ""their ancient poems,"" where this event is commonly related in"
3651,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,almost historical style[136]. From such expressions we must conclude
3652,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"that Jordanes knew, directly or indirectly, of Gothic poems which he"
3653,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,believed to have been in existence for a considerable time.
3654,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3655,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,Jordanes' language may be compared with Einhard's reference to the
3656,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,'barbarous and very ancient poems' collected by Charlemagne (cf. p.
3657,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,62). But in reality there appears to be an essential difference between
3658,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,the minstrelsy of the Heroic Age and that of Charlemagne's time. In the
3659,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,latter period we hear only of 'very ancient poems' or of poems dealing
3660,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"with 'the deeds of the ancients,' as in the story of Bernlef. The two"
3661,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"expressions may really be more or less equivalent, for there is nothing"
3662,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,to show that Bernlef was an original composer. For the existence in
3663,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"his time of court-minstrelsy, or indeed of any poetry dealing with"
3664,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"contemporary persons and events, we have no evidence which can be"
3665,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,called satisfactory[137].
3666,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3667,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,In the Heroic Age on the other hand we have references not only to
3668,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"'ancient poems' but also to original compositions, dealing with the"
3669,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"praise or fortunes of living men. The exploits of Attila, one of the"
3670,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"leading figures of that age, were sung in his own presence, as we know"
3671,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,from an eye-witness. We need scarcely doubt therefore that Beowulf
3672,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,truly reflects the spirit of the times when it makes one of the Danish
3673,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,king's thegns compose a poem on the hero's exploit immediately after
3674,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,the event. It is to such compositions that heroic poetry--indeed in a
3675,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,sense we may say the Heroic Age itself--owes its origin.
3676,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3677,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,The beginning of the process may be seen from a few passages in
3678,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"Widsith. At the end of the poem we are told that ""he who wins praise"
3679,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,(_lof_) shall have his glory (_dom_) established on high beneath the
3680,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"sky."" The meaning of the first expression is explained by another"
3681,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"passage (v. 70 ff.): ""I have been in Italy with Alboin. No human being,"
3682,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"as far as my knowledge goes, had a readier hand than had Audoin's"
3683,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"son for the winning of praise, nor a heart more ungrudging in the"
3684,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"distribution of rings and shining bracelets."" We may compare also what"
3685,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"the poet says of his patroness, the princess Ealhhild (v. 99 ff.):"
3686,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"""Her praise spread through many lands, when I set myself to declare"
3687,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,in song where under heaven it was that I knew of a gold-adorned queen
3688,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"who lavished presents in the noblest fashion."" The chief object which"
3689,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,the characters of the Heroic Age set before themselves is to 'win
3690,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,glory'--to have their fame celebrated for all time. Thus in Beow. 1387
3691,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"ff. the hero says: ""Let him, who can, win for himself glory before he"
3692,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"dies; that is the best thing which can come to a knight in after times,"
3693,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"when he is no more."" Such glory may be won by brave deeds, as when"
3694,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,Beowulf says to Hrothgar before his second adventure (_ib._ 1490 f.):
3695,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"""I will win for myself glory with Hrunting (a sword), or death shall"
3696,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"take me,"" or again when the queen says to Beowulf (_ib._ 1221 ff.):"
3697,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"""Thou hast brought it about that men shall esteem thee far and near"
3698,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"and for all eternity, wheresoever the sea encircleth its wind-swept"
3699,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"barriers."" But the same object can be attained by generosity, which"
3700,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,will ensure one's praise being sounded from court to court.
3701,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3702,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,Now perhaps we are in a better position to understand why the Heroic
3703,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,Age ends when it does. The latest person mentioned in the heroic poems
3704,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,is Alboin who died about 572. The last Roman author who mentions
3705,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"Teutonic court-minstrelsy is Venantius Fortunatus, who wrote apparently"
3706,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,about ten years later. Is there a connection between these two facts?
3707,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,It should be remembered that we have felt some hesitation in including
3708,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"Alboin among the characters of the Heroic Age, for though his praises"
3709,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"were sung among the Saxons and Bavarians, as well as in England, he"
3710,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,does not figure in any widely known story. We may reasonably expect
3711,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,that such stories would as a rule--not necessarily--require a certain
3712,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,time in which to be elaborated. Is it possible that in Alboin's time
3713,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,the conditions favourable to such elaboration were no longer in
3714,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,existence--that court-minstrelsy was dying out or had lost its creative
3715,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,power?
3716,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3717,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,It will perhaps be urged that the absence of reference to
3718,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,court-minstrelsy after Venantius' time may be due to mere accident.
3719,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,But a short consideration of the political position will show that
3720,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,there is good reason for thinking otherwise. During the period which
3721,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,had elapsed since the time of Priscus and Sidonius--we may say roughly
3722,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,about a century and a quarter--the Teutonic world had undergone great
3723,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"changes. Many kingdoms had disappeared, among them those of the"
3724,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"Huns, Rugii, Heruli, Alamanni, Thuringians, Burgundians, Vandals and"
3725,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"Ostrogoths, and probably also the Warni and Gepidae. Of the nations"
3726,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"which survived the Visigoths and Langobardi, and to a large extent"
3727,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"the Franks also, were settled among alien peoples and thus exposed to"
3728,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"denationalising influences. This is partly true also of the Bavarians,"
3729,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,and they moreover had become subject to the Franks before the middle
3730,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,of the sixth century. Probably the only other Teutonic kingdoms which
3731,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"remained on the Continent were those of the Frisians and the Danes, for"
3732,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,there is no evidence that the Old Saxons were under kingly government
3733,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,at this time[138]. Moreover the Danes were almost cut off from the
3734,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,western peoples by the irruption of the Slavs who now occupied the
3735,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,greater part of ancient Germany. Hence we may conclude that even if
3736,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,court-minstrelsy survived in a few places the poems had now no longer
3737,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,any chance of obtaining a wide international circulation.
3738,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3739,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,The change of faith is of course another consideration which must be
3740,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,taken into account. One of its effects was to cut off the Christian
3741,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,kingdoms from those of the Frisians and Danes. Probably also it had an
3742,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"adverse influence on the cultivation of court-minstrelsy, for there can"
3743,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,be little doubt that this was originally permeated by heathen ideas.
3744,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,At all events we find in later times surprisingly few traces of heroic
3745,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"poetry in the territories of the Franks, Visigoths and Langobardi."
3746,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3747,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"Of the purely Teutonic kingdoms, excluding Denmark, that of the"
3748,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,Frisians was the last to retain both its independence and its religion.
3749,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,It can hardly be due to accident therefore that some of the most
3750,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"important of the heroic poems, such as Kûdrûn (cf. p. 34) and probably"
3751,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"also the Norse version of the story of Sigurðr (cf. p. 59), appear to"
3752,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"be derived from Frisian sources, though this region was not their"
3753,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"original home. Further, we have noticed that in Frisian law a special"
3754,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,compensation was fixed for injury done to the hand of a harpist. Still
3755,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,more significant is the fact that in the passage quoted above (p.
3756,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"80) from the Vita Liudgeri, describing Bernlef's skill in reciting"
3757,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"heroic poetry, one text adds the words _more gentis suae_. It would"
3758,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,seem then that minstrelsy of this type was regarded as a distinctive
3759,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,characteristic of the Frisians and that heroic poetry retained its hold
3760,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,upon them at a time when it was little known elsewhere.
3761,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3762,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,In England the conditions appear to have been quite different from
3763,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"those with which we have been dealing, for at the end of the sixth"
3764,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,century this country probably contained more Teutonic kingdoms than
3765,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,did the whole of western and central Europe. We have seen reason for
3766,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,believing that Beowulf was composed within about half a century of
3767,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,Venantius' time and that the other heroic poems may date from the same
3768,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,period. From the evidence which we have discussed above we should
3769,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,naturally conclude that court-minstrelsy lasted somewhat longer in
3770,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"England than elsewhere, although it dealt entirely with stories derived"
3771,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,from abroad. It is true that there is no external evidence for such
3772,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,minstrelsy; but that is fully explained by the fact that we have
3773,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,practically no literature of any kind before the last decades of the
3774,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,seventh century. Most probably its extinction was due to that wave of
3775,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,religious fervour which was started by the Kentish king Erconberht
3776,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,and which in the course of the following half century seems to have
3777,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,succeeded in enforcing conformity to the new faith throughout the whole
3778,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,country.
3779,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,

3781,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3782,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,It will be convenient now to consider briefly the court-poetry of the
3783,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,Viking Age. The history of heroic poetry in the North unfortunately
3784,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,cannot be traced in its entire course. We have seen that there is a
3785,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"long gap, extending over some two centuries and a half, in Danish"
3786,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"tradition, and also that the poems which have come down to us are"
3787,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,probably all of Norse (Norwegian-Icelandic) origin. Yet the social
3788,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,conditions of the Viking Age were very different from those which
3789,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,prevailed on the Continent during the same period and unquestionably
3790,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,nearer than the latter to those of the Heroic Age. It is not
3791,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,unreasonable therefore to expect that the court-poetry of the Viking
3792,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,Age may throw light on the earlier period.
3793,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3794,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"We saw in an earlier chapter (p. 15 f.) that, apart from the Edda, Old"
3795,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,Norse literature is rich in narrative poems of the ninth and tenth
3796,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,centuries. These are usually the work of known authors and deal for the
3797,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"most part with contemporary persons and events, though they contain"
3798,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"frequent references to characters of the Heroic Age, as well as to the"
3799,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"ancestors of reigning princes. Many of the authors, such as Thióðolfr"
3800,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"of Hvín, Thórbiörn Hornklofi and Goððormr Sindri, were what we may"
3801,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"call court-minstrels--or rather court-poets, for the harp seems not"
3802,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"to have been used by such persons, at least in the latter part of the"
3803,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,Viking Age. But they can scarcely be regarded as professionals in any
3804,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,strict sense of the term. As a rule they appear to have been men of
3805,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"good family. Thióðolfr was a familiar friend of Harold the Fair-haired,"
3806,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,who entrusted him with the education of one of his sons. Goððormr
3807,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"Sindri, who composed poems for the same king, refused to receive any"
3808,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,reward and had sufficient influence with Harold to insist on his being
3809,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,reconciled with his son Halfdan Svarti. Another poet of the same
3810,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"period, Einarr[139], commonly called Torf-Einarr, was earl of Orkney"
3811,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"and practically an independent prince. Eyvindr Skaldaspillir, who was"
3812,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"attached to the service of Haakon I and Haakon, earl of Lade, was"
3813,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,himself a descendant of Harold the Fair-haired.
3814,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3815,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,It has been mentioned that from the middle of the tenth century onwards
3816,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,most of the poems quoted in the sagas are of Icelandic authorship.
3817,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"A considerable number of them may be regarded as court-poems, since"
3818,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,they were composed in honour of princes whom the authors were visiting
3819,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,at the time. As an example we may take a verse quoted by Gunnlaugs
3820,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"Saga Ormstungu (cap. 7) from the poem composed by the hero, when he"
3821,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"visited London in 1001: ""The whole nation reveres England's generous"
3822,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"ruler as a god; all ranks, warrior prince and people alike, bow"
3823,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"down to Aethelred."" Such poems were often handsomely rewarded."
3824,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"Aethelred presented Gunnlaugr with a scarlet cloak, lined with fur and"
3825,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"embroidered with lace, while Sigtryggr, king of Dublin, gave him a"
3826,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"fur-lined cloak, a lace-embroidered tunic and a gold ring which weighed"
3827,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,a mark. It happened very frequently that men like Gunnlaugr would
3828,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,enter a king's retinue and remain with him for months and even years.
3829,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"But they would seldom consent to recognise any lordship permanently,"
3830,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"since as a rule they had lands of their own in Iceland, to which they"
3831,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,eventually returned.
3832,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3833,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,It is hardly probable that any class of persons exactly corresponding
3834,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"to this existed in the Heroic Age itself, for with the somewhat"
3835,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,doubtful exception of the Old Saxons we have no evidence for
3836,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"independent commonwealths during that period. In Widsith, it is true,"
3837,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,we have the case of a minstrel who claims to have wandered far and
3838,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"wide and to have visited many princes by whom, like Gunnlaugr, he"
3839,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,was handsomely rewarded. But Widsith had a lord at home to whom he
3840,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"subsequently returned. Indeed the introduction, if we may use it as an"
3841,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"authority, seems to make him set out at first on a definite commission"
3842,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,from that prince. The permanent lordless state was probably altogether
3843,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,foreign to the conditions of the Heroic Age. The lordless man in the
3844,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"poems is either one who has lost his lord, as in the Wanderer, or one"
3845,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"who has been dismissed from his lord's service, like Deor. Until he"
3846,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"finds another lord he has neither home nor security, and his condition"
3847,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,is pitiable in the extreme.
3848,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3849,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,But it is by no means so clear how the court-minstrels of the Heroic
3850,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,Age differed from the Norwegian poets of the Viking Age. In Kûdrûn the
3851,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,minstrel Hôrant (Heorrenda) seems to hold a position quite comparable
3852,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,with that of Thióðolfr or Goððormr Sindri; indeed he is even described
3853,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"as a relative (_mâc_) of the king[140]. Again, we may take the case of"
3854,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,Starkaðr. He is commonly regarded as the type of a roving poet-warrior
3855,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,of the Viking Age. But in reality he seems to belong to the Heroic Age;
3856,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,for however late the poems attributed to him may be in their final
3857,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"form, they had their counterparts in England probably as early as the"
3858,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,sixth century. There is no conclusive evidence for denying either that
3859,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,he was the foster-father of Ingialdr (Ingeld) or that he entered the
3860,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,service of a number of different kings.
3861,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3862,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,The story of Starkaðr is bound up with the history of heroic poetry in
3863,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"the Viking Age--a difficult problem, to which we shall have to refer"
3864,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,again shortly. We may note here however that the poems of Thióðolfr
3865,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,and Hornklofi must have been preserved for some three centuries by
3866,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,oral tradition before they were committed to writing. There seems to
3867,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,be no reason therefore for denying in principle the possibility that
3868,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,poems may have survived even from the Heroic Age. It is to be observed
3869,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"that court-poets were expected to be able to recite old poems, as well"
3870,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,as works of their own composition. Thus on the morning of the battle
3871,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,of Stiklestad (A.D. 1030) St Olaf ordered the Icelander Thórmóðr
3872,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,Kolbrúnarskald to recite the old Biarkamál. This story is interesting
3873,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,as it shows that the love of the heroic poems was strong enough to
3874,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,assert itself in an hour of supreme danger and under a most religious
3875,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,king.
3876,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3877,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,*       *       *       *       *
3878,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3879,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,In the course of this chapter we have seen that one of the
3880,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,characteristics of the Heroic Age was the prevalence of
3881,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"court-minstrelsy of a certain type, namely the recitation of metrical"
3882,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,speeches accompanied by the harp. The cultivation of such minstrelsy
3883,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"seems to have been more or less general, and it is certain that princes"
3884,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,had their praises and exploits celebrated in poems of this kind during
3885,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,their lifetime and even in their presence. But with the close of the
3886,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,Heroic Age the evidence for minstrelsy of this type apparently ceases
3887,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,altogether. In the eighth century we hear only of wandering minstrels
3888,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,who are invited into houses or perform in the streets. The minstrelsy
3889,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,of this period seems not to have been creative. At all events it deals
3890,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"only with characters belonging to former times, Ingeld or Alboin or"
3891,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,ancient kings in general. Between these two periods we have to set the
3892,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,composition of the English heroic poems and probably also those German
3893,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"poems which were regarded as ancient in Charlemagne's time. Lastly,"
3894,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,we find in Germany a series of poems dating from the twelfth and
3895,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,thirteenth centuries in which the old stories are treated again but in
3896,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,a new form.
3897,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3898,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,It appears then that the history of heroic poetry falls naturally
3899,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,into four stages. To Stage I belong the court-poems of the Heroic Age
3900,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,itself; to Stage II the epic and narrative poems based on these; to
3901,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,Stage III the popular poetry of the eighth and following centuries;
3902,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"to Stage IV the German poems of the twelfth and following centuries,"
3903,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,composed at a time when heroic subjects had again come into favour with
3904,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,the higher classes.
3905,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3906,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,To Stage I we may assign not only laudatory poems dealing with the
3907,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"victories and valour of living princes, but also such compositions"
3908,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,as Gelimer's dirge and choric songs like the funeral chant over
3909,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,Attila[141]. From this stage probably nothing has come down to
3910,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,us--though it would be difficult to point out any essential difference
3911,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,between Gelimer's dirge and the Elegy of Deor. We can form an idea
3912,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"however of these earliest poems from the poetry of the Viking Age,"
3913,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,which seems to have been composed under very similar conditions. As
3914,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,instances we may cite Gunnlaugr's poem on Aethelred II (cf. p. 91 f.)
3915,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"and Eyvindr's poem on the death of Haakon I, which we shall have to"
3916,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,discuss later.
3917,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3918,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"Stage II is represented by the Anglo-Saxon poems, which are clearly"
3919,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"products of court-life, as we have seen (p. 81 ff.). From its general"
3920,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,resemblance to these it seems probable that the Hildebrandslied belongs
3921,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,to the same class. Some writers draw a distinction between Beowulf and
3922,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"Waldhere on the one hand and Finn and the Hildebrandslied on the other,"
3923,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,classifying the former as epics and the latter as lays (Lieder). It
3924,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,may be granted that the style of the two latter poems appears to be
3925,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,more rapid and less diffuse than that of the others. Still I should
3926,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"prefer to speak of short and long epics, or rather perhaps of short"
3927,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,and long narrative poems. Very probably the earliest narrative poems
3928,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,were comparatively short. It may be that poems on the scale of Beowulf
3929,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,were first composed in England--though this can hardly be proved.
3930,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,But the difference between the two classes seems to me to be one of
3931,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,degree and not of kind. At all events no one will suggest that the
3932,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,Hildebrandslied is even approximately contemporaneous with the events
3933,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,which it professes to describe. One would expect it to be at least as
3934,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,remote from them as is the case with Beowulf.
3935,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3936,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,Stage III is directly represented only by certain ballads such as the
3937,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"Seyfridslied, which in their present form date from a time considerably"
3938,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,later than the poems belonging to Stage IV. Much indirect evidence
3939,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"however can be obtained from various sources of earlier date, e.g. from"
3940,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"Thiðreks Saga af Bern, which is largely based on the popular heroic"
3941,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"poetry of northern Germany, and from parts of Saxo's History which seem"
3942,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,to be derived from Danish ballads. So far as we can judge from our
3943,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,authorities the popular poems seem to have differed in many ways from
3944,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,those which we have been discussing. They tended to simplify complex
3945,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,stories by the loss of minor characters and to amalgamate stories
3946,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"which were originally quite unconnected. Again, they appear to have"
3947,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"had a preference for biographical sketches, whereas the court poems"
3948,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,are usually occupied with accounts of adventures which lasted only a
3949,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,few days. We may add also the absence of any detailed acquaintance
3950,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,with court-life and a general approximation to the characteristics of
3951,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"folk-tales, e.g. in the introduction of nameless characters and persons"
3952,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,of humble station.
3953,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3954,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,It must be remembered of course that our authorities knew the popular
3955,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,poems only as they existed in the twelfth century[142]. We cannot
3956,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,say with any confidence that Bernlef's poems possessed the same
3957,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,characteristics. There is nothing to show that the Hildebrandslied was
3958,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"written down before his time, and it may be to persons of his type"
3959,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,that we owe its preservation. The Anglo-Saxon poems may not have been
3960,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,committed to writing till a still later period. All that we can say is
3961,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,that they show no obvious signs of popular corruption and that their
3962,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,diction is much more archaic than that of poems which were composed
3963,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,in the eighth century. We have seen that in Iceland poems of a rather
3964,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,elaborate type could be preserved by oral tradition for over three
3965,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,centuries. This however was in a community which was largely given up
3966,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,to the cultivation of poetry. A knowledge of the old poems would be a
3967,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,necessary part of the training of those who hoped to win rewards for
3968,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,their art in foreign courts. Such favourable conditions can hardly have
3969,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,existed either in England or Germany. The process of disintegration
3970,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,which the poems underwent in the latter country points to their being
3971,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"preserved only by village minstrels, who as time went on became less"
3972,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,and less expert in their profession.
3973,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3974,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"Stage IV is represented by the Middle High German epic poems, which"
3975,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,both in form and spirit show all the characteristics of the age in
3976,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,which they were composed. In England this stage was never reached.
3977,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,There may have been a revival of interest in heroic poetry during the
3978,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"ninth and tenth centuries, but we have no evidence for the composition"
3979,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,of new poems on these subjects.
3980,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3981,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,There can be no doubt that the poems of Stage IV are derived from
3982,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,those of Stage III. But the question may be raised whether the latter
3983,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,were necessarily derived from poems of Stages I and II--whether some
3984,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,heroic poems may not have been entirely of popular origin. It may be
3985,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,freely granted that the poetry of Stage II was constantly exposed to
3986,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"popular influence, especially in the form of folk-tales. Most scholars"
3987,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"indeed hold that some of the best known heroic stories, such as those"
3988,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"of Sigurðr-Siegfried and Weland, are derived from popular mythology."
3989,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,With this problem we shall have to deal later. On the whole however I
3990,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,am inclined to doubt whether we possess a single heroic story which has
3991,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,not been treated in court-poetry at an earlier stage in its career.
3992,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
3993,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"Again, the relationship between Stage I and Stage II is not so simple"
3994,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,as the bare statement given above might seem to imply. In the first
3995,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,place it is only as a class that poems of Stage I can be regarded as
3996,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,the earlier. Individual poems may very well be later than others which
3997,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,belong to Stage II. Thus it is extremely probable that Gothic princes
3998,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,were listening to laudatory poems about themselves at a time when
3999,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"other Gothic poems, of a definitely narrative type, were coming to be"
4000,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"regarded as ancient. Then again, poems of a more or less narrative type"
4001,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,may have been composed quite soon after the events which they treat.
4002,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,Hornklofi's Hrafnsmál and the poem on the battle of Brunanburh must
4003,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"be regarded as analogous to poems of Stage I, but it is only a short"
4004,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"step from such works to purely narrative pieces. Indeed, in a sense,"
4005,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"we may almost class among narrative poems Eyvindr's Hákonarmál, which"
4006,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,describes the fall of Haakon I at the battle of Fitje. Yet the author
4007,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,was himself present at the battle. It is by no means clear then that
4008,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,poems belonging to Stage II necessarily presuppose the existence of
4009,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,earlier poems or indeed of materials of any kind beyond the author's
4010,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,personal knowledge and imagination.
4011,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
4012,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"But, more than this, we are scarcely justified in denying the"
4013,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,possibility that even epics may have been composed upon quite recent
4014,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,events. Few will deny that the poem on the battle of Maldon has a good
4015,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"claim to that title, whatever its original length may have been. The"
4016,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"extant portion contains nine speeches, by seven different persons."
4017,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"Twenty-two warriors in the English army are mentioned by name, and in"
4018,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,about a dozen cases the names of their fathers or other relatives are
4019,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,also given. The poem differs from the heroic type in the fact that it
4020,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,does not record the name of a single person among the enemy; but that
4021,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,need not prevent us from regarding it as an epic. Yet there can be no
4022,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"reasonable doubt that it was composed within a few years, possibly even"
4023,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"months, of the battle[143]."
4024,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
4025,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,It is likely enough that the author of this poem was well acquainted
4026,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,with heroic poetry and that his treatment of the subject was affected
4027,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,thereby. But is that any objection to supposing that poems of this type
4028,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,may have been composed within the Heroic Age itself? We have no reason
4029,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,whatever for denying that this age was capable of such compositions.
4030,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,Indeed there is one piece of evidence which points very much to the
4031,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,contrary.
4032,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
4033,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,This is a passage which occurs in Procopius' History of the Gothic
4034,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,War (IV 20). After describing the embassy sent to Justinian by the
4035,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"Utiguri in the year 551, the author goes on to state that 'about this"
4036,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,time' hostilities broke out between the nation of the Warni and the
4037,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,Angli (Ἀγγίλοι) who inhabit the island of Britain (Βριττία). Not long
4038,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"before the Warni had been ruled by a king named Hermegisklos who,"
4039,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"being anxious to establish his throne on a secure foundation, sought"
4040,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"and obtained in marriage a sister of Theodberht, king of the Franks."
4041,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"By a previous wife he had an only son named Radiger, who at this time"
4042,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,was betrothed to a sister of the king of the Angli and had paid her a
4043,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"large sum of money in furtherance of his suit[144]. One day, when the"
4044,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"king was riding in a certain place with the chief men of his nation, he"
4045,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"saw a bird sitting on a tree and croaking loudly. Now, whether it was"
4046,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"that he really understood what the bird said, or whether he had some"
4047,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,other source of information but pretended that the bird was uttering a
4048,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,prophecy which he understood--at all events he declared on the spot to
4049,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"his companions that he would die forty days later, for this had been"
4050,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,clearly foretold to him by the bird[145]. Thereupon he gives advice
4051,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"as to what should be done after his death, namely that Radiger should"
4052,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"marry his widow, in accordance with national custom, and dissolve"
4053,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,his engagement with the English princess. On the fortieth day the
4054,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"king died, and Radiger proceeds to carry out his injunctions. But the"
4055,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"princess, infuriated at his conduct, gathers together a fleet of four"
4056,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"hundred vessels and invades the land of the Warni with 100,000 men."
4057,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"Radiger's army is completely defeated, and he takes refuge in a dense"
4058,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"forest. The princess insists on his being taken alive at all costs, and"
4059,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,eventually he is captured and brought before her. He expects to be put
4060,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"to death, but after explaining the cause of his action, he is pardoned"
4061,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,on condition that he returns to his former engagement.
4062,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
4063,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"This story contains a number of features, such as the prophecy of the"
4064,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"bird, the payment of the 'bride-fee' and Radiger's marriage with his"
4065,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"stepmother, which show clearly that it was derived from someone who"
4066,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,was well acquainted with the peoples of northern Europe. There is no
4067,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,ground for disputing that it has a historical basis; but at the same
4068,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,time it is obviously much more than a mere record of facts. Apart from
4069,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,the incident of the bird and the gross exaggeration apparent in certain
4070,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"details[146], the pictorial character of the narrative, especially"
4071,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"in its earlier part, indicates a close affinity with heroic poetry."
4072,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,Un-heroic features are not wanting--the introduction of nameless
4073,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,persons and the political reflections of Irmingisl--but they may with
4074,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,probability be attributed to Procopius himself. I do not mean to
4075,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"suggest that his source of information was an epic poem, but I do think"
4076,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,that the intellectual atmosphere which could produce such a story must
4077,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,have been exactly of the kind most favourable to the growth of such
4078,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,compositions.
4079,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
4080,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"Procopius, as we have seen, places this war in or about the year 551,"
4081,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,and we can certainly understand the course of events more easily if
4082,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"it took place after Theodberht's death (A.D. 548). Therefore, since"
4083,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,Procopius' work appears to have been written within the next seven or
4084,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"eight years, the story had had little time to develop before it came"
4085,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,to his ears. On the other hand we must remember that it refers to a
4086,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,distant region--a fact I think not without significance for the history
4087,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,of contemporary narrative poetry. To persons who had themselves taken
4088,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,part in the events poems like that on the battle of Brunanburh would
4089,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,appeal much more strongly than purely narrative pieces. It is for
4090,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,persons who were either ignorant of the events or knew them only by
4091,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,hearsay that the latter would seem to be primarily intended.

4094,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
4095,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,In this discussion we have taken no account of the heroic poems of the
4096,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,Edda. There can be little doubt that these poems must be assigned to
4097,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,Stage IV of our scheme; for though some of them are probably three or
4098,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"four centuries older than the German poems of this class, they bear"
4099,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,fairly obvious marks of the disintegrating process which seems to
4100,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,characterise popular poetry[147]. It may be asked how such an opinion
4101,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,is compatible with the view that the story of Sigurðr was derived
4102,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,from the Continent during the seventh century (cf. p. 59). The true
4103,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"explanation is, I believe, that heroic poetry passed through Stage III"
4104,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,after it became known in Norway.
4105,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,
4106,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"We noted in an earlier chapter (pp. 30, 33) that Norway plays no part"
4107,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,in stories of the Heroic Age. On the other hand it has what we may call
4108,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,a Heroic Age of its own--namely the Viking Age. We have no poems--and
4109,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,few stories of any kind--dealing with persons of Norwegian nationality
4110,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"who lived before that period. The remoteness, poverty and mountainous"
4111,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"nature of the country doubtless retarded its development, not only"
4112,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,politically but also in the cultivation of poetry. The strophic
4113,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,character of all Norse poetry is generally held to point to a choric
4114,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"origin, and it may very well be that this primitive type of poetry"
4115,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,was the only one used in Norway when the heroic stories first became
4116,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,known there. Possibly it was to Frisian and Danish minstrels that the
4117,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,change was due[148]. But the conditions suitable for a flourishing
4118,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"court-poetry, like that of the Heroic Age, scarcely existed before the"
4119,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,"last years of the eighth century, when Norwegian princes had begun to"
4120,THE POETRY AND MINSTRELSY OF EARLY TIMES.,enrich themselves with maritime enterprises.

4252,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,which we have been discussing is probably to be found among the various
4253,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,peoples of Serbo-Croatian nationality. As an example we may take the
4254,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,poetry current among the Mohammedan population of Bosnia[149]. Since
4255,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,the occupation of that province a large number of narrative poems have
4256,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"been collected and published, though only a few are as yet accessible"
4257,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,in translations. These poems afford an interesting illustration of our
4258,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"subject, not only because they deal with similar themes--heroism in"
4259,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"battle, single combats, love and revenge--and often in quite as full"

4261,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"the conditions they reflect belong to a well-marked historical period,"
4262,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,which we may regard as a kind of Heroic Age. The period in question
4263,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"embraces the greater part of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,"
4264,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"more especially the latter, a time when the Turkish Empire was at the"
4265,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"height of its power, and when its armies were frequently engaged in"
4266,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,hostilities with the Austrians in Hungary and Croatia. Many of the
4267,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,characters mentioned in the poems are well known historical persons.
4268,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,
4269,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,But beyond all this the value of the illustration lies largely in the
4270,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"fact that we have here what may be called a living heroic poetry,"
4271,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,such as we hear of among the Teutonic peoples only through occasional
4272,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,notices in ancient records. As among the latter it is customary for the
4273,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"minstrel (_pivač_, dial. for _pjevač_) to accompany his recitation on a"
4274,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"musical instrument, the _tambura_, a kind of guitar with only two metal"
4275,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"strings. Among the Christian population the _gusle_, a primitive type"
4276,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"of fiddle, is in use."
4277,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,
4278,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,The poems vary greatly in length. Out of 320 pieces collected by
4279,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"Dr Marjanović thirty contained less than 100 verses, while fifteen"
4280,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"exceeded 2000, the longest of all amounting to over 4000. The average"
4281,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,length of the pieces described as epic is given at 873 verses; a
4282,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"hundred and three vary from 600 to 1000, and sixty-two from 1000 to"
4283,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,1500. These figures are especially important in view of their bearing
4284,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,on certain prevalent ideas as to the limits of oral poetry. It is to be
4285,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"observed that the ordinary Servian metre is decasyllabic, the verse not"
4286,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,being appreciably shorter than the average Teutonic alliterative verse.
4287,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"The minstrel begins his recitation quite slowly, but after about a"
4288,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,hundred verses he attains such a speed that not even a shorthand writer
4289,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"can keep pace with him. Such recitations are extremely fatiguing, and"
4290,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,in the longer poems it is customary to allow intervals of rest for
4291,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"refreshments, questions and criticism. It will be seen that if carried"
4292,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"out on these principles the recitation of a Teutonic poem of 2000, or"
4293,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"even 3000, verses would be nothing impossible in the course of a long"
4294,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,evening's entertainment.
4295,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,
4296,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,In the 'recitation' great freedom is allowed. A minstrel need only hear
4297,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"a poem two or three times (once, if it is sung) in order to reproduce"
4298,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,it; but the reproduction is by no means given in the same words. To
4299,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"a certain degree, says Prof. Murko, every minstrel is a more or less"
4300,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,creative poet ('Nachdichter'). But even by the same man a poem is never
4301,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,repeated in exactly the same words. In the course of years changes may
4302,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,be introduced which apparently render it almost unrecognisable. Some
4303,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"minstrels are experts in particular lines, special popularity being"
4304,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,enjoyed by those who know best how to describe a girl's dress or the
4305,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,trappings of a horse. The faculty for expansion and compression is
4306,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,also very marked. Cases are known of minstrels who have doubled and
4307,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,even trebled the length of poems which they had heard. In one instance
4308,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"two variants of a poem are known, of which one contains 1284 verses,"
4309,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"the other barely 300. Such cases, as Prof. Murko remarks, supply"
4310,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,interesting evidence for the origin of different recensions of epic
4311,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"poems--particularly, we may add, for the relationship of lays and epics."
4312,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,
4313,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,From what has been said it will be clear enough that the poems are
4314,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,preserved by oral tradition. Vague rumours of written texts are heard
4315,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"of from time to time and, though none have yet been discovered, it"
4316,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,seems probable that some poems have been committed to writing in the
4317,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,past. But the minstrels of the present day are invariably unable to
4318,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,read or write. As to the age and origin of the poems nothing is known
4319,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"for certain, though most of them are believed to be about two centuries"
4320,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,old. Four minstrels knew of an authoress--a certain 'pale-cheeked Ajka'
4321,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,from the Lika (in Croatia); but regarding her little or no information
4322,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,seems to have been obtained. The other minstrels could only give the
4323,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,names of those from whom they had themselves heard the poems.
4324,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,
4325,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,The minstrels belong to various stations of life. Some are men of good
4326,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"family, but the majority are peasant proprietors or workmen. Not many"
4327,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"carry on minstrelsy as a regular profession, except when they have"
4328,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,fallen on bad times. The recitations are given in coffee-houses or at
4329,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,any holiday gathering. Very often too the minstrels are invited to the
4330,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,residences of the Begs[150]. The case is recorded of one minstrel who
4331,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,recited over a hundred poems for a certain Beg within six weeks. The
4332,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,Mohammedan ladies are especially fond of such recitations. For his
4333,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"services the minstrel receives payment, sometimes in money, sometimes"
4334,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"in corn or livestock, sometimes only in coffee and cigarettes."
4335,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,
4336,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,It will not escape notice that a good deal of what is said here
4337,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,might be applied with considerable probability to the Frisian
4338,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,minstrel Bernlef or the English minstrels mentioned by Alcuin.
4339,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"Indeed, apart from the coffee and cigarettes, there is scarcely a"
4340,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,single feature in the description given above for which we should
4341,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,not expect to find parallels in Teutonic minstrelsy towards the
4342,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,close of the eighth century. We may therefore reasonably look for
4343,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,traces of those characteristics which distinguish Stage III in
4344,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"the history of Teutonic heroic poetry, and in point of fact there"
4345,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,seems to be abundant evidence in this direction[151]. The action is
4346,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,usually spread over a considerable time. The characters mentioned
4347,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,by name are few in number and recur again and again in different
4348,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"stories, each district apparently having a favourite hero who is"
4349,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,introduced as its representative on many different occasions[152].
4350,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"Geographical indications are very frequently erroneous, while"
4351,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,historical persons figure in quite unhistorical relationships. The
4352,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,unsympathetic characters are often guilty of atrocious brutality.
4353,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"Moreover, we constantly find repetitions of the same words or formulae"
4354,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,in consecutive verses after the manner of ballads. Indeed the
4355,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,characteristics of the poems generally--their merits as well as their
4356,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,faults--are to a large extent those of popular rather than court poetry.
4357,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,
4358,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"But, though the poems show the characteristics which we associate with"
4359,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"Stage III, it is questionable whether we are justified in including"
4360,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,them in this category; for there is no evidence that they have passed
4361,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,through anything corresponding to Stages I and II. Practically the
4362,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"only court which they know at all is that of Stamboul, and of this"
4363,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,their knowledge is naturally slight and remote. The highest personages
4364,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,with whom they are really acquainted are the Begs. It is not unlikely
4365,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,that in the days of Turkish supremacy--the sixteenth and seventeenth
4366,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,centuries--the provincial nobility were much more wealthy and
4367,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,influential than they now are; and it may be that some Begs then had
4368,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,minstrels attached to their own personal following. But their position
4369,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,can never have been comparable with that of even petty Teutonic
4370,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"princes. Hence, if we are entitled to suggest the previous existence of"
4371,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"court-poetry at all, it can only be in a very restricted sense--so far"
4372,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,at least as the extant poems are concerned.
4373,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,
4374,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"On the other hand Servian poetry has without doubt had a long history,"
4375,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,and even heroic poems are by no means the exclusive property of the
4376,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,Mohammedan population. Indeed some of the Christian poems[153] seem to
4377,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,exhibit the characteristics of Stage III to a far less degree than the
4378,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,Mohammedan ones; and they frequently deal with much earlier events.
4379,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,It is likely enough that the beginnings of heroic poetry go back to
4380,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"the fourteenth or fifteenth centuries[154], at which time its growth"
4381,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,may have been fostered by conditions much more similar to those of the
4382,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,Teutonic Heroic Age. To this question we shall have to refer again.
4383,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,The subject as a whole however is one which must be left to experts.
4384,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,In order to form a sound opinion one would have to take account of
4385,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"the history of narrative poetry among the neighbouring peoples, more"
4386,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,especially the Bulgarians and Slovenians[155]. The total change of
4387,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,subjects in the Mohammedan poems would be a necessary consequence of
4388,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,the change of faith; that heroic poetry survived such a change at all
4389,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,is probably to be attributed to the fact that a large proportion of the
4390,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,nobility in Bosnia embraced Islam.
4391,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,
4392,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,Before we leave the subject however note must be taken of one more
4393,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,important feature in the poems. The Mohammedan Bosnians were religious
4394,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"fanatics, and the spirit of religious war is generally present. It"
4395,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,is not absolutely universal; some poems even represent Moslems and
4396,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,Christians in sworn brotherhood. As a rule however the world is
4397,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"regarded as divided into two hostile camps, one under the Sultan"
4398,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"(Car), the other under the Emperor (Ćesar). In this respect, as in"
4399,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"several others, Bosnian poetry shows affinity with the Old French"
4400,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"epics, whereas in early Teutonic poetry differences of creed, and even"
4401,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"nationality, are scarcely recognised."

4405,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,In the north of Russia numerous ballads are still current which seem to
4406,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,be based on events much more remote than anything treated in Servian
4407,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,poetry. Many of them deal with stories relating to the time of Vladimir
4408,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"I, who ruled over Kiev about 980-1015, and their antiquity is rendered"
4409,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"highly probable by the fact that the same king, together with his chief"
4410,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"hero, Ilja of Murom, figures in Thiðreks Saga af Bern. In their present"
4411,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,form these ballads show the characteristics of popular poetry to such
4412,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,an extent that they are scarcely distinguishable from folk-tales. Yet
4413,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,it is possible that they are in part descended from poems which might
4414,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,fairly be brought under Stages I and II of our scheme.
4415,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,
4416,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,At all events there is some reason for suspecting that in early times
4417,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,court-poetry was not unknown in Russia. Evidence to this effect is
4418,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"supplied by the Slovo o polku Igorevě ('Story of Igor's expedition'),"
4419,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"which may be described as an epic, though it has no fixed metrical"
4420,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"form. The subject is a disastrous expedition undertaken by Igor, the"
4421,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"son of Svjatoslav, against the Polovtses on the Don in the year 1185."

4424,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"a striking resemblance to Anglo-Saxon heroic poetry. ""Igor leads his"

4431,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,It is held by many that this work was composed by a bard who belonged

4433,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,last relic of what may once have been a considerable body of poetry.
4434,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,Certainly we may note that the author repeatedly refers to a certain
4435,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"'Bojan the Wise, nightingale of ancient time,' a poet who is unknown"
4436,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"from other sources, but who apparently lived nearly a century before"
4437,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,the composition of the Slovo. This carries us back practically to what
4438,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"we may call the Russian Heroic Age, for Bojan is represented as singing"
4439,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,the praises of the sons of Vladimir I. In their time the Russian courts
4440,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,still maintained intimate relations with the Scandinavian kingdoms.

4444,NOTE IV. ON THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE SLAVONIC PEOPLES.,"in part at least, to Scandinavian influence."

4498,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,In the history of the various Celtic peoples there is evidence for
4499,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,the existence of more than one Heroic Age. In the first place we
4500,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"have some traces of heroic poetry among the ancient Gauls, though"
4501,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"unfortunately it has entirely perished, together with all their"
4502,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,vernacular records. Then again Ireland has preserved a great body of
4503,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"heroic literature, referring to a remote period. But, whatever may"
4504,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"have been their original form, these stories have come down to us for"
4505,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"the most part only in prose. Moreover, the subject is beset with so"
4506,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"many difficulties, both historical and linguistic, that it cannot be"
4507,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,approached with safety except by an expert. We shall have to confine
4508,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,our attention therefore to the heroic poetry of the Cymry.
4509,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,
4510,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,Even here the difficulties to be encountered are sufficiently serious.
4511,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,Yet it is fairly clear that many of these poems deal with events which
4512,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,are referred by the chronicles to the sixth century and the first half
4513,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,of the seventh. We may note especially four groups of poems: (1) a few
4514,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,concerned with the exploits of Arthur and his heroes; (2) a somewhat
4515,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"larger number referring to princes named Gwallawg, Urien and Rhydderch;"
4516,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,(3) certain poems dealing with _Gododin_ and _Catraeth_; (4) a few
4517,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"relating to Cadwallon. There are also two or three others, such as the"
4518,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"elegy over Cynddylan, which seem to refer to the same period, though"
4519,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,they cannot be classed under any of these headings. A number of the
4520,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"above poems, especially those included in the second and third groups,"
4521,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,are attributed to two poets named Taliessin and Aneirin.
4522,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,
4523,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,There is no doubt that Cadwallon is the well known Welsh king who
4524,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,overthrew the Northumbrian king Edwin in 633 and was himself destroyed
4525,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,by Oswald in the following year. But the poems of the second group seem
4526,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,also to have a historical basis. In the Historia Brittonum (Harleian
4527,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"text), § 63, we hear of four kings, _Urbgen et Riderch Hen et Guallanc"
4528,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"et Morcant_, who fought against the Northumbrian king Theodric and"
4529,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"his successors, Frithuwald and Hussa. Urbgen is said to have besieged"
4530,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"his opponents for three days in Lindisfarne (_Metcaud_), and to have"
4531,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,perished eventually through the jealousy of Morcant. In another passage
4532,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,(§ 62) we hear of _Neirin et Taliessin_ among other poets who composed
4533,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"British poetry in the time of a king named Dutigirn[157], who is made"
4534,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"contemporary with Ida, the father of Theodric. The origin of these"
4535,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,entries is unfortunately obscure. They are incorporated with an English
4536,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"genealogical document, dating apparently from the end of the eighth"
4537,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,century; but they may quite possibly be derived from earlier sources.
4538,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,In any case they cannot well be later than the first quarter of the
4539,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,ninth century.
4540,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,
4541,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,All the four kings mentioned in § 63 are known to us also from
4542,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"genealogies of the tenth century. But one of them, Riderch Hen, is"
4543,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"named in Adamnan's Life of St Columba, which is of course altogether"
4544,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,independent of Welsh tradition. It is there stated (I 15[158]) that
4545,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"Rodercus, king of Dumbarton, consulted St Columba as to his fate and"
4546,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,received the answer that he would die a peaceful death in his house--a
4547,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,prophecy which was subsequently fulfilled. As St Columba died probably
4548,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"in 597, the date given for Riderch Hen agrees well enough with what is"
4549,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,stated in the Historia Brittonum; for according to the most trustworthy
4550,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,records Theodric and his two immediate successors reigned from about
4551,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,572 to 592 or 593. We have no ground for doubting that the references
4552,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,to Urbgen and the rest are based on equally good tradition.
4553,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,
4554,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,For the characters mentioned in the Gododin poems no such evidence is
4555,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,available. The poems themselves however contain references to the death
4556,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"of _Dyvynwal Vrych_--doubtless the Dalriadic king Domnall Brecc, who"
4557,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,according to the Irish annals was killed by the Britons three years
4558,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"after the fall of Oswald, i.e. about the year 645. Unfortunately it"
4559,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,is not made clear in what relationship this event stands to the main
4560,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,action of the poems[159]. The few identifications which can be made
4561,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,from the genealogies seem to be compatible with a date somewhere about
4562,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,this time.
4563,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,
4564,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,There can scarcely be any doubt that we are justified in regarding
4565,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,the period covered by the poems as a kind of Heroic Age. The story of
4566,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,Arthur was the one most elaborated in later times--a process which
4567,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"must have begun before the ninth century, when it was incorporated in"
4568,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,the Historia Brittonum (§ 56). How much historical truth this story
4569,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"contains we do not know, though the chronicles refer Arthur to the"
4570,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"early part of the sixth century, i.e. the beginning of our period. To"
4571,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,a certain extent however the other stories have experienced the same
4572,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"process; for, apart from the question when the poems under discussion"
4573,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"were composed, there are others of undoubtedly later date, such as the"
4574,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"Englynion y Beddau, in which the same heroes are mentioned. Moreover it"
4575,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,must not be assumed that these were the only persons of the same period
4576,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"whose praises were celebrated in poetry. Maelgwn, king of Gwynedd, who"
4577,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"died about 548, figures prominently in traditions of later times, and"
4578,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,it is likely enough that the beginnings of these stories were due to a
4579,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,similar cause. On the other hand there is apparently no evidence for
4580,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,the composition of poems dealing with the exploits of princes who lived
4581,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,in the latter part of the seventh century or for several centuries
4582,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,later.
4583,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,
4584,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,As to the origin of the poems discussed above we have no evidence which
4585,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,can be called conclusive. Some of the poems themselves claim to be the
4586,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,work of the poets Aneirin and Taliessin. At the present time however
4587,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,it seems to be generally held[160] that they are scholastic products
4588,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"of a later age, based upon chronicles and composed with the intention"
4589,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,of glorifying the ancestry of some distinguished Welsh families. In
4590,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,support of this view it is contended that the language of the poems
4591,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,cannot possibly represent the form of Welsh spoken in the sixth or
4592,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,seventh centuries. But this argument is scarcely decisive; for it
4593,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,is clear that parts of the poems have undergone a certain amount of
4594,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"modernisation, and it is by no means incredible that the same process"
4595,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,may have been in operation for centuries. I find it difficult to
4596,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,believe that in order to celebrate the ancestry of certain families
4597,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,poems would be composed recording an action which is represented as an
4598,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"overwhelming disaster for the British forces, such as that described in"
4599,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,the Gododin poems. And can it really be proved that many of the heroes
4600,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,celebrated in these poems were claimed as ancestors by families in
4601,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,Wales?
4602,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,
4603,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,At all events it is clear that the author of the entries in the
4604,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,Historia Brittonum knew of ancient British poets. _Neirin_ and
4605,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"_Taliessin_ are only two out of five names recorded by him, the rest"
4606,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,apparently being altogether unknown from other sources[161]. It is
4607,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,true that he places all these persons about a generation before Urien
4608,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"and Rhydderch Hen, but chronological accuracy is hardly to be expected"
4609,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,in references to such a remote period. Certainly we should note that
4610,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,the last British king mentioned in these entries is a certain Cadafael
4611,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"(_Catgabail Catguommed_), who is said to have escaped alone from the"
4612,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,battle in which Penda was killed (A.D. 655). The wording of this
4613,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,passage (§ 65) seems rather to suggest acquaintance with a poem on the
4614,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,subject.
4615,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,
4616,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,We have seen now that the persons and events celebrated in the poems
4617,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,belong to a period extending roughly from 500 to 650 and that there
4618,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"are ancient records of famous British poets, who are referred to"
4619,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,the earlier part of this period and of whom two are traditionally
4620,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,associated with the poems. Next we must notice that the poems
4621,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"themselves, even in the corrupt and often unintelligible form in"
4622,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"which they are preserved, plainly show all the marks of Stage I of"
4623,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"our scheme. Their characteristics are those of court-poetry, but they"
4624,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,never attain to true narrative. For analogies to the poems which deal
4625,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,with Urien we can hardly do better than turn to the court-poetry of
4626,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"the Viking Age (cf. pp. 15 f., 91); for the Gododin poems perhaps the"
4627,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,best parallels are to be found in the Battle of Maldon and the Story
4628,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"of Igor's Expedition, though in both the latter the narrative element"
4629,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"is much more fully developed. Taking all the evidence into account,"
4630,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,it seems to me that the choice lies between two alternatives: either
4631,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"the poems really are works of Stage I, which have survived from the"
4632,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"Heroic Age itself, or they are exceedingly clever imitations of such"
4633,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"works, composed at a time when the latter were still in existence."
4634,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,The decision between these two alternatives must of course be left to
4635,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,experts. In the meantime we shall be ready to admit that the poems are
4636,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"extremely corrupt, and that in some cases perhaps we have nothing more"
4637,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,than disjecta membra of earlier pieces. But until conclusive evidence
4638,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,is brought forward it seems to me highly improbable that the original
4639,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,poems have been entirely lost[162].
4640,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,
4641,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,The history of Cumbrian heroic poetry is easily intelligible when
4642,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,taken in connection with the national history. It is probable enough
4643,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,that on the withdrawal of the legions large portions of the country
4644,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,were occupied by northern Britons from beyond the Wall--who are
4645,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,represented in tradition by Cunedda and his sons[163]. These were
4646,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,doubtless affected by Roman influence to a very much less degree
4647,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,than the inhabitants of the province; and the growth of heroic poetry
4648,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,during the sixth century may be satisfactorily accounted for by the
4649,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,wealth and prosperity which would naturally accrue to their princely
4650,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,families during the early days of their dominion. It was probably not
4651,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,until the time of Aethelfrith that their power was really broken.
4652,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"But the following half century was a most disastrous period, ending"
4653,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,in the permanent obliteration of their nationality--in a political
4654,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,sense--throughout the whole region between the Dee and the Clyde. Any
4655,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"records which survived must owe their preservation, ultimately at"
4656,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"least, to refugees who escaped into the Welsh highlands."
4657,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,
4658,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"Now we can see why so many place-names (Reged, Catraeth and dozens of"
4659,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"others) are incapable of identification. But further, the conditions in"
4660,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"Wales, the poorest and probably the most backward part of the province,"
4661,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,were doubtless highly unfavourable to the development of heroic poetry.
4662,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,Under such conditions we should expect that narrative poems would
4663,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,rapidly disintegrate into the semblance of folk-tales; and it may be
4664,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,that here we have the explanation of the medieval stories of Arthur. At
4665,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,all events they show a certain resemblance to the Russian stories of
4666,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"Vladimir and his heroes. But Arthur, as we have seen, belongs to the"
4667,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,beginning of the Heroic Age. We have no evidence for the composition
4668,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,"of poems, which can properly be called narrative, dealing with the"
4669,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,later heroes. Here the original type of poem seems to have become
4670,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,stereotyped--presumably because conditions favourable to development
4671,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,were no longer present. The only marvel is that so much has been
4672,NOTE V. THE HEROIC POETRY OF THE CELTIC PEOPLES.,preserved.

4715,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
4716,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
4717,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Most of the heroic poems and stories which have come down to us contain
4718,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"elements generally comprehended under the term 'folk-tale' (Märchen),"
4719,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,and it will be convenient at once to distinguish tales of this class
4720,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,from popular tales in general. Under the latter term we may include
4721,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,all stories which are frequently repeated without being committed to
4722,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,writing. It is on such foundations probably that all the surviving
4723,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,heroic poems are built. The lapse of time between the events narrated
4724,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,and the composition of the poem may amount to weeks or to generations;
4725,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,in certain cases the story may be wholly fictitious--but this does not
4726,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,affect our definition. When a story is put into metrical form by a
4727,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,skilful poet it becomes more or less crystallised and has a good chance
4728,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,of being preserved. In fact the result is somewhat similar to that of
4729,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,committing it to writing. Stories which are not put into poetic form
4730,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,are more liable to become obscured and forgotten.
4731,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
4732,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,The term 'folk-tale[164]' is of less wide application. Probably
4733,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,different scholars would define it in different ways; but in this
4734,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,book it is applied only to stories dealing with anonymous characters.
4735,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,The hero or heroine (villain etc.) is described either (1) as 'the
4736,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"man,' 'the girl,' etc., or (2) by some common name such as Jack or"
4737,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Hans, which conveys no means of identification, or (3) by a name"
4738,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,which is obviously made to suit his or her special circumstances or
4739,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"characteristics, such as Aschenbrödel or Sneewitchen. It will be seen"
4740,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,that this limitation would not prevent us from regarding stories about
4741,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the gods as folk-tales in origin; for most of the gods bear descriptive
4742,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"names, e.g. Thunor, Frig, Balder, Frey. Yet by the time of our earliest"
4743,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,authorities these names had come to denote definite personalities; and
4744,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"consequently we must classify such stories in a separate category,"
4745,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,namely as myths. On the other hand it must not be assumed that the
4746,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"presence of supernatural features, in some form or other, is a"
4747,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,necessary characteristic of folk-tales. Such features do indeed occur
4748,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,very frequently; but that is due merely to the fact that in illiterate
4749,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,societies the marvellous has a special attraction for men's minds.
4750,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
4751,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Into the origin of folk-tales in general we need not enter here. Some
4752,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"apparently spring from attempts to account for natural phenomena,"
4753,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,social customs or religious rites. Others are probably founded on
4754,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"adventures, real or fictitious, of individuals whose names have been"
4755,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"forgotten. Thus, to take an instance, the story of Alfred and the"
4756,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,cakes is not a folk-tale according to our standard; but if the king's
4757,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,name had been forgotten we should have no hesitation in regarding it
4758,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"as such. Again, there can be no doubt that many modern folk-tales are"
4759,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,derived ultimately from literary sources. In the same way we must
4760,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,regard it as possible that in earlier times many folk-tales were
4761,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,descended from heroic poems.
4762,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
4763,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Prof. Olrik[165] has pointed out that it is possible very often to
4764,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,distinguish between the Danish and Norse sources followed by Saxo in
4765,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,his History. One of the safest criteria is the presence or absence of
4766,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"characters whose names are not given. In stories of Norse origin, as in"
4767,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Old Norse literature generally, it is customary for every character to"
4768,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,have a name--a characteristic which also distinguishes the old heroic
4769,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,poetry. In stories derived from Danish sources on the other hand the
4770,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,characters mentioned by name are few in number. A good instance is
4771,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"to be found in the story of Ingellus (Ingeld), which in consequence"
4772,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,of the loss of proper names has been torn right away from its true
4773,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,connections--as may be seen by a comparison with Beowulf. Yet there
4774,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"can be little doubt, as we have seen, that this story is ultimately"
4775,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,derived from heroic poems. It would appear then that Danish tradition
4776,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,tended to approximate to the folk-tale.
4777,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
4778,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,If heroic stories sometimes passed into folk-tales it is still clearer
4779,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,that the latter tended to make their way into heroic stories. We
4780,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,shall see shortly that even the early heroic poems relate a number of
4781,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"incidents which seem to be derived from folk-tales, while in the later"
4782,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"forms of the stories such incidents become more and more frequent, most"
4783,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,commonly in connection with the childhood or ancestry of the hero.
4784,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,The same phenomenon occurs of course in stories of famous men which
4785,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,have nothing to do with heroic poetry. Thus there is a widely spread
4786,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"folk-tale (told of the god Thor in Old Norse literature), which relates"
4787,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"how some animal, a goat, reindeer or calf, is killed and eaten, but"
4788,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,care is taken not to break any of its bones. Then on the following day
4789,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the hero restores the animal to life. In the Historia Brittonum (cap.
4790,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"32) this story is related of St Germain, the well known bishop of"
4791,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Auxerre.
4792,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
4793,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,It is a more difficult question and one which we shall have to discuss
4794,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,later whether any of the heroic stories are wholly derived from
4795,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"folk-tales. The story of Balder bears the stamp of a folk-tale, for"
4796,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"the chief characters (Balder, Höðr, Nanna) have names with an obvious"
4797,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,meaning. But it is only in Saxo's History that this story appears in
4798,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,a heroic setting; and though his account seems to be more primitive
4799,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"in several respects than that given by the Norse authorities, there"
4800,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,is some reason for suspecting that either he himself or one of his
4801,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,(comparatively recent) predecessors was responsible for the setting.
4802,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,It should be observed however that the occurrence of one or more names
4803,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,with obvious meanings does not in itself prove that a story is derived
4804,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,from a folk-tale. Thus in the story of Heðinn and Högni the fact that
4805,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the heroine (in contrast with the other characters) bears a name which
4806,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,means 'war' does not of necessity involve her origin in a folk-tale any
4807,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"more than that of her namesake, the abbess of Whitby."
4808,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
4809,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Apart from the distinguishing feature with which we have been dealing
4810,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,folk-tales as a class have certain general characteristics which may be
4811,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,appreciated by a comparison with those of heroic poetry. In the last
4812,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,chapter (p. 82 f.) we gave a short list of the characteristics by
4813,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,which the latter is specially distinguished. To all these the typical
4814,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"folk-tale presents a marked contrast. Some of the leading characters,"
4815,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"including either the hero or the heroine or both, are usually persons"
4816,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,of humble birth. The opponents of the hero or heroine tend to be
4817,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"represented as monsters of cruelty or vice, even when they are of royal"
4818,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"rank, as is often the case. There is no inclination to avoid horrible"
4819,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,or coarse subjects. Above all we miss those detailed descriptions of
4820,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,court life upon which the heroic poems are so fond of dwelling. The
4821,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,life and thought which we find reflected in folk-tales is that not of
4822,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the court but of the village.
4823,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
4824,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,It would of course be rash to assume that folk-tales formed the
4825,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,sole intellectual pabulum of the peasantry in early times. No doubt
4826,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"we have to add 'popular tales,' similar to those which formed the"
4827,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,foundation of the heroic poems. But since these tales were not put
4828,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,into poetic form--i.e. not into such poetic form as would ensure their
4829,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,preservation[166]--they were always liable to disintegration and thus
4830,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"were constantly approximating to folk-tales. Hence, though we must make"
4831,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"allowance for influence of the one upon the other, it is probably not"
4832,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,so very far from the truth that what heroic stories were to the courts
4833,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,folk-tales were to the rest of the population.
4834,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
4835,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"In Norway court poetry flourished down to Christian times, though in"
4836,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the generation before the conversion it had come mainly into the hands
4837,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,of Icelanders. But practically nothing is known as to the existence
4838,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"of court poets in Denmark; and here we have, I think, the explanation"
4839,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,of the peculiar character of the Danish sources used by Saxo. The
4840,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"old heroic poems had been largely forgotten, and what remained was"
4841,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,preserved only in the form of ballads and popular tales--which in some
4842,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,cases practically amounted to folk-tales.
4843,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
4844,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Lastly, we must note that the existence of a folk-tale may sometimes be"
4845,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,inferred when we have no knowledge of it in its uncontaminated form.
4846,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Such is the case (e.g.) when we find the same adventure, especially"
4847,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"if it be of a supernatural character, related of several different"
4848,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"and unconnected persons, whose historical existence may be quite"
4849,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,satisfactorily authenticated. But such inferences must be used with
4850,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"caution, for it is not necessary to suppose that supernatural incidents"
4851,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,in heroic stories are always due to the influence of folk-tales. They
4852,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,may often truly reflect the belief of an age which did not clearly
4853,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,distinguish between natural and supernatural. That the supernatural is
4854,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,less prominent in heroic poetry than in folk-tales is due doubtless to
4855,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the fact that the courts of that period possessed a far higher degree
4856,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,of culture than the rest of the population. The same phenomenon is
4857,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,still more noticeable in Welsh literature than in Teutonic. In the
4858,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"early court poems the supernatural is comparatively little in evidence,"
4859,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"whereas in the Mabinogion, which are largely made up of folk-tales, it"
4860,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,is developed to a most astounding degree.

4863,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
4864,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Various kinds of supernatural beings are brought before our notice in
4865,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,heroic stories. In the Northern versions the god Othin is introduced
4866,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"not unfrequently. Thus, to give a few instances, the Völsunga Saga"
4867,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,brings him into contact with Sigmundr on two occasions: first when he
4868,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,enters Völsungr's hall at the wedding feast and plants in the tree a
4869,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"sword which Sigmundr alone is able to draw out (cap. 3), and again in"
4870,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,his last battle when the hero's sword is shattered at the touch of
4871,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Othin's javelin (cap. 11). Twice also the same saga makes him meet
4872,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,with Sigurðr: first when he chooses for him the horse Grani (cap.
4873,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"13), and later when he accompanies him on his way to attack the sons"
4874,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,of Hundingr (cap. 17; cf. also cap. 18). In all these cases alike the
4875,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"god's identity is not suspected, at least until after his departure. In"
4876,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"the poem Reginsmál, from which the last of these incidents is taken,"
4877,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,we find also a story of quite a different character and laid wholly in
4878,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"the realm of the supernatural, namely the adventures of the gods Othin,"
4879,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Hoenir and Loki with the otter and the dwarf Andvari. Of other divine
4880,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"or semi-divine beings we may mention Hlióð, the daughter of Hrímnir and"
4881,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"adopted daughter of Frigg, who became the wife of Völsungr and mother"
4882,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,of Sigmundr. As a last instance reference may be made to a passage from
4883,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"the lost Biarkamál (Saxo, p. 66), where the hero suspects that Othin is"
4884,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,present among the enemy and expresses his desire to attack him.
4885,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
4886,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"In the German heroic poems, which are entirely Christian, we find no"
4887,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,mention of the gods. Note should be taken however of an incident in the
4888,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Rabenschlacht (v. 964 ff.), where Witege in his flight from Dietrich"
4889,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,gallops into the sea and is rescued by the mermaid Wâchilt. If we were
4890,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,dealing with a Greek story we should regard this person as a goddess
4891,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,without hesitation.
4892,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
4893,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,In much earlier times a very good instance is furnished by the
4894,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,legendary history of the Langobardi. According to the story (cf. p. 9
4895,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"f.) the Langobardi, who were then called Winniles, soon after their"
4896,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,emigration from Scandinavia came into conflict with the Vandals. The
4897,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Origo Gentis Langobardorum, an anonymous tract dating from the latter"
4898,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"part of the seventh century, gives the following account of what"
4899,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"happened: Ambri and Assi, the leaders of the Vandals, asked Wodan"
4900,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,(_Godan_) that he should give them victory over the Winniles. Wodan
4901,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"replied, saying: ""Whomsoever I shall first look upon, when the sun"
4902,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"rises, to them will I give victory."" Then Gambara with her two sons"
4903,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Ibor and Aio, who were chiefs over the Winniles, asked Fria (_Frea_),"
4904,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"the wife of Wodan, that she should be gracious to the Winniles. Fria"
4905,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,then gave counsel that the Winniles should come when the sun rose and
4906,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,that their women should let down their hair about their faces after the
4907,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"fashion of a beard and should come with their husbands. Then, as it"
4908,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"became light, while the sun was rising, Fria turned the bed, on which"
4909,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Wodan lay, and put his face to the east and wakened him. And he looked"
4910,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,and saw the Winniles and their women with their hair let down about
4911,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"their faces and said: ""Who are those long-beards?"" And Fria said to"
4912,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Wodan: ""As thou hast given them a name, give them also victory."" And he"
4913,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"gave them victory, etc."
4914,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
4915,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Woden is mentioned also in the Anglo-Saxon poem on the magic herbs,"
4916,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,and Ing in the Runic poem. In strictly heroic pieces however the only
4917,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,possible case is the reference to the passionate love of Geat in the
4918,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Elegy of Deor (v. 15)[167]. Indeed, were it not for the Langobardic"
4919,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,story we might perhaps suspect that the introduction of the gods in
4920,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"heroic poetry was a Scandinavian innovation. But as the case stands,"
4921,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"although this story cannot properly be regarded as heroic, it is more"
4922,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,likely that their non-appearance in the English heroic poems is due to
4923,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,a process of expurgation or elimination. From such passages as Beow.
4924,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,175 ff. we may infer with probability that no definite reference to the
4925,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,gods would be tolerated after the courts had become Christian (cf. p.
4926,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,53 f.).

4930,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,In the poems which have come down to us the supernatural element is
4931,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,represented chiefly by what we may call monsters. This is especially
4932,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"the case in Beowulf, the main part of which is devoted to encounters"
4933,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,with such beings. We can hardly obtain a better example than the hero's
4934,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,adventures in the first part of the poem. But it will be well at the
4935,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,outset to guard against the assumption that the story of Beowulf was in
4936,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,any way typical of early heroic poetry. Thus we have no satisfactory
4937,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,evidence that either the story of Waldhere or that of Finn contained
4938,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"supernatural elements of any kind, while even in that of Siegfried they"
4939,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,are comparatively unimportant.
4940,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
4941,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,The story of Beowulf's adventures with the monsters seems to be derived
4942,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"from a folk-tale. In the Icelandic Grettis Saga, cap. 64-66, the famous"
4943,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"outlaw Grettir, who died in 1031, is credited with performing almost"
4944,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the same exploits. The resemblance between the two stories indeed
4945,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"descends in some cases even to small points of detail. These, as well"
4946,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"as the points of difference, may best be seen by giving an analysis of"
4947,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the two side by side.

5004,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,followers remain on the bank.
5005,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
5006,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,There can scarcely be any doubt that these two stories are connected in
5007,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,some way. Some scholars indeed hold that the Icelandic story is derived
5008,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,from the other; but the discrepancies seem to me to be too great for
5009,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,this to be probable. Moreover there is another Scandinavian story
5010,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,which has to be taken into account. This is contained in Orms Tháttr
5011,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Storolfssonar[169], a document which dates from the fourteenth century,"
5012,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,and also in later ballads from Sweden and the Faroes. According to the
5013,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,story Ormr was an Icelander who lived towards the end of the tenth
5014,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,century. Like Beowulf and Grettir he had a reputation for laziness in
5015,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,his youth. In his time an island called Sauðey off the coast of Norway
5016,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,was inhabited by the monster Brusi and his mother who had the form of
5017,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"a black cat. One of Ormr's friends, a Dane named Asbiörn, lost his"
5018,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,life in an attack upon them. Ormr then set out to avenge him. When he
5019,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"reached the monster's den the cat assailed him fiercely with her claws,"
5020,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,but he ultimately succeeded in destroying her. Then he had an encounter
5021,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"with Brusi, whose head he tore open with his hands, afterwards cutting"
5022,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the 'blood-eagle' upon his back. In the den he found a large amount
5023,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,of gold and silver. The later forms of the story add several features
5024,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"which recall the adventures of Beowulf, especially in regard to the"
5025,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,situation of the den and the cannibalistic propensities of the monsters.
5026,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
5027,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Here again we have in all probability only another form of the same
5028,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,story. But it is to be observed that there is no special affinity
5029,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"between the two Scandinavian versions, while the setting and the names"
5030,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,of the characters are entirely different in all three. Yet if one
5031,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,version was really the source of the others it is difficult to believe
5032,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,that every trace of its original connections could have vanished.
5033,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,With far more probability we may conclude that the story once existed
5034,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"independently, i.e. in the form of a folk-tale, and as a matter of fact"
5035,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,we possess an Icelandic folk-tale which contains most of the principal
5036,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"features, though the hero has been split up into five brothers[170]."
5037,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,In its original form the tale was probably only a specialised variety
5038,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,of the type familiar to us through Jack the Giant-killer. Stories of
5039,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,this kind seem to have been particularly popular in Norway--a fact due
5040,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,perhaps in part to the survival of isolated savage communities among
5041,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,whom cannibalism may not have been entirely unknown[171]. We meet with
5042,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,them sometimes in quite unexpected places. Thus in the account of
5043,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Thóroddr Snorrason's mission to Jemtland in St Olaf's Saga (Heimskr.),"
5044,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"cap. 151, we find a graphic and circumstantial story of a female"
5045,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,monster who killed and devoured eleven merchants in the inn where the
5046,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"envoy was resting. Thor too, the chief Norwegian deity, came to be"
5047,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"regarded essentially as a giant-killer, his origin in the thunder being"
5048,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"entirely, or almost entirely, forgotten."
5049,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
5050,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,It is no serious objection to our view that Grettir seems to be a
5051,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,perfectly historical character; for no one will contend that the story
5052,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"of his doings at Sandhaugar is true, any more than a number of other"
5053,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,exploits with which he is credited. The same remark applies to the
5054,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"story of Thóroddr, whose father, the magistrate Snorri (Grettir's"
5055,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"contemporary), was perhaps the best known and most influential man"
5056,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,in Iceland. We have seen that in the true folk-tale the hero is
5057,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,nameless; but his adventures are liable to become linked with the
5058,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,names of historical characters--just as in our own day everyone knows
5059,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,of remarkable persons who have had associated with them stories
5060,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,which really were in existence before their time. In Grettir's case
5061,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,exceptionally favourable conditions for such association were provided
5062,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"by the man's great strength, by the unruly disposition which he showed"
5063,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,from his childhood and by the many thrilling adventures which he
5064,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"doubtless did experience during his long outlawry. Indeed, though the"
5065,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,saga in its present form was not composed until nearly three centuries
5066,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"after his time, we might naturally expect that many untrue stories"
5067,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,about such a person would be in circulation even before his death.
5068,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
5069,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Just as the folk-tale became attached to the historical Grettir, so"
5070,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,it may have been associated with another person in earlier times.
5071,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Now the only character in Northern tradition who has been identified
5072,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"with Beowulf is a certain Boðvarr Biarki, a warrior in the service"
5073,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"of Hrólfr Kraki. The identification is denied by many scholars, but"
5074,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,there are two points in the story of Biarki which seem to me to lend
5075,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,great probability to it. In the first place as Beowulf goes from the
5076,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"land of the Geatas (Gautar), where his uncle is king, to the court"
5077,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"of the Danish king Hrothgar, so Biarki goes from the land of the"
5078,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Gautar, where his brother is king, to the court of Hrólfr Kraki, i.e."
5079,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Hrothwulf, Hrothgar's nephew and colleague. Secondly, at a later time"
5080,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Biarki, like Beowulf, assists the Swedish prince Aðils (Eadgils) in his"
5081,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"victorious campaign against Áli (Onela), though he is represented not"
5082,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,as king of the Gautar but as Hrólfr Kraki's emissary.
5083,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
5084,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,On the other hand it is true that no resemblance to the story of
5085,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Beowulf is shown by the Scandinavian accounts of Biarki's origin and
5086,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"death. In Hrólfs Saga Kraka[172], which dates only from the fourteenth"
5087,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"century, Biarki is said to have been born in Norway. His father was"
5088,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,called Biörn ('bear') and his mother Bera ('she-bear'). The former
5089,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"indeed was actually turned into a bear by witchcraft. Further, from the"
5090,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,time of his arrival in Denmark Biarki remained in the service of Hrólfr
5091,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,till the end and lost his life in the final attack made upon that king.
5092,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,A reminiscence of his ursine antecedents appears in the last scene.
5093,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,When the enemy are attacking the king's hall Biarki cannot be roused
5094,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"out of slumber, but a huge bear (the warrior's spirit) is seen fighting"
5095,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,among the king's knights.
5096,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
5097,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Saxo says nothing about Biarki's origin and it may be that the story
5098,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,given in the saga was unknown in his time. At all events it is
5099,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,doubtless derived from a folk-tale. In the twelfth century Vita et
5100,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Passio Waldevi[173] almost the same story is told of the father of
5101,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Siward, the famous earl of Northumbria, who died in 1055, while a"
5102,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"further parallel is to be found in the De Gestis Herwardi Saxonis[174],"
5103,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,another work of the same period. Both stories contain indications
5104,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,of Scandinavian origin and we can hardly doubt that the motif was a
5105,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,popular one in the folk-tales of the North. Indeed for the version of
5106,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"the story found in Hrólfs Saga, transformation into animal form through"
5107,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"the agency of a wicked stepmother, analogies are to be found in many"
5108,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,parts of the world.
5109,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
5110,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,In his account of the last fight Saxo quotes at great length from
5111,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the lost Biarkamál; but here again no reference is made to the bear
5112,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,motif[175]. We may note however that in this version no explanation
5113,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,is given of Biarki's behaviour in refusing to rise from his bed in
5114,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,response to the exhortations of his colleague[176]. It is scarcely
5115,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"safe therefore, I think, to assume that Saxo's account--apart from the"
5116,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,quotations which consist entirely of speeches--necessarily represents
5117,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,an earlier form of the story than that given in the saga; for in the
5118,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,latter Biarki's conduct is quite satisfactorily explained. There is
5119,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,surely at least as much to be said for supposing that the incident
5120,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,of the bear--or something which gave rise to it--has been ignored or
5121,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,forgotten by Saxo.
5122,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
5123,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Now Beowulf is represented as an enormously strong man, but his"
5124,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,strength is not altogether of a natural order. We are told that he
5125,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,was fated not to gain victory with the sword. It is not only the
5126,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,struggle with Grendel which he wins by wrestling; in v. 2506 f. we hear
5127,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,that he hugged or crushed to death the Frisian champion Daeghrefn--a
5128,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,method of warfare appropriate to a bear rather than to a man. The
5129,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,explanation is perhaps to be found in the curious phenomenon called
5130,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"_berserksgangr_[177], which is so frequently mentioned in sagas and"
5131,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,even in legal works. It is to be remembered that in popular belief this
5132,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"form of madness was connected with the werwolf idea, of which the bear"
5133,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,form was a common variety. The transition therefore to the story found
5134,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,in Hrólfs Saga is nothing very strange.
5135,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
5136,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,In conclusion mention must be made of an incident which has been
5137,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,brought into connection with the fight between Beowulf and Grendel.
5138,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"In Hrólfs Saga, cap. 23, it is stated that shortly after his arrival"
5139,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,at the Danish court Biarki encountered and slew an animal demon which
5140,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,at two successive Yules had ravaged the livestock in the king's farm.
5141,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Saxo alludes clearly to the same story when he states that Biarki won
5142,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,great fame by killing a huge bear[178]. Now it should be observed that
5143,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"the representation of Grendel is by no means clearly anthropomorphic,"
5144,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,though the human element is much more apparent in the cave scene. The
5145,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"various accounts may, I think, be satisfactorily reconciled on the"
5146,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,hypothesis that in the original story the hero killed a monster or
5147,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,demon (_iötunn_) in the form of a bear (_biarnar hamr_). In England
5148,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,this story must have been expanded and modified by the influence of the
5149,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,folk-tale of the two cannibal monsters which we have discussed above.
5150,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"In Scandinavian tradition however no such intrusion took place, though"
5151,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,a totally different folk-tale became attached to the early history of
5152,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the same hero.

5156,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Two adventures with dragons are recorded in Beowulf. The first, that of"
5157,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Sigemund, is related quite briefly (vv. 884-900), but the second forms"
5158,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"the subject of the latter part of the poem. The Older Edda (Fáfnismál),"
5159,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"followed by the prose Edda and Völsunga Saga, gives an account of"
5160,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the killing of Fáfnir by Sigurðr; and in the late Seyfridslied two
5161,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,adventures of the same kind are narrated in connection with the same
5162,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"hero. Dragons figure also occasionally in the German epics, especially"
5163,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,in the story of Wolfdietrich. Here too we must mention Saxo's accounts
5164,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,of the dragons slain by the Danish kings Frotho I and Fridleuus II. The
5165,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"two stories are almost identical, but the former (p. 38) contains a"
5166,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"description of the dragon and of the means to be used in attacking him,"
5167,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,which is given in Latin verse and may very well be derived from an old
5168,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,poem.
5169,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
5170,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,There are certain resemblances between Saxo's stories and the great
5171,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"dragon fight in Beowulf, and many scholars are inclined to the view"
5172,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,that they have a common origin. The former however in both cases
5173,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,ended successfully. Moreover in two points at least they agree rather
5174,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"with the adventure ascribed to Sigemund in Beowulf, namely (i) that"
5175,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the hero attacks and kills the dragon alone and (ii) that he carries
5176,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,away the treasure in a boat. On the other hand it is generally agreed
5177,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"that the stories of Sigemund and Sigurðr must be connected, though"
5178,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,opinion is divided as to whether the adventure was first ascribed to
5179,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the father or the son. Beowulf is at all events by far the earliest of
5180,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the authorities. Against this stands the fact that both Scandinavian
5181,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,and German tradition names Sigurðr (Siegfried) as the hero. But this
5182,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,argument could have weight only if there was reason for thinking that
5183,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the story was known in the North before the composition of Beowulf.
5184,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
5185,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Fáfnir is called _dreki_ in Völsunga Saga, but he seems always to"
5186,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,be represented rather as a reptile than a dragon. It is not at all
5187,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,clear that he is a being of the same kind as the dragon encountered
5188,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"by Beowulf, which is said to fly and breathe fire. This is perhaps to"
5189,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"be noticed, since the flying dragon is also known in the North; we"
5190,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,find it mentioned even in old poems such as Völuspá. The description
5191,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,of Sigemund's dragon is too brief to enable us to determine its
5192,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,character. It is once called _draca_ and thrice _wyrm_; but the latter
5193,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,word is used also of the flying dragon. On the other hand it is not
5194,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,certain that the word _draca_ always denotes a supernatural being. The
5195,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,_saedracan_ and _niceras_ mentioned in Beowulf 1425 ff. would seem from
5196,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the description to be animals of the seal-class.
5197,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
5198,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"One feature however is common to all the English and Northern dragons,"
5199,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,namely that they are represented as guarding hoards of gold. In the
5200,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"North this idea must have been very widespread, since expressions such"
5201,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,as 'bed of the dragon' (or 'snake') are among the commonest terms for
5202,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,gold in Old Norse poetry. In Anglo-Saxon poetry also it is generally
5203,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,recognised[179].
5204,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
5205,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,It has been mentioned above that many scholars connect the story of
5206,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Beowulf's dragon-fight with that related of Frotho I by Saxo. To me the
5207,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,affinities of the latter seem rather to lie with Sigemund's dragon;
5208,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,but the truth may be that for adventures of this kind there was a
5209,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,standard poetic description which could be applied to any number of
5210,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,cases. More important perhaps is the fact that genealogically Saxo's
5211,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Frotho I corresponds to Beowulf the son of Scyld[180]. In common with
5212,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,practically all Scandinavian genealogical texts Saxo has the series
5213,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Frotho[181]--Haldanus--Ro (Hróarr) and Helgo corresponding to the
5214,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Beowulf--Healfdene--Hrothgar and Halga of the poem[182]. Quite possibly
5215,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,therefore it is not without significance that this person is credited
5216,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,with having killed a dragon.
5217,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
5218,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,We have seen that the two stories differ essentially in regard to
5219,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the outcome of the adventure. Frotho's death is recorded by Saxo in
5220,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,quite a different connection and apparently long afterwards. But here
5221,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"we may turn to the story of the other Frotho, Saxo's Frotho III (the"
5222,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Peaceful), for there can be little doubt that the two characters were"
5223,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,originally identical. According to Saxo this latter king was killed
5224,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,in his old age by a sorceress who had taken the form of a 'sea-cow'
5225,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"(_marituma bos_), though the author does not make clear what kind of"
5226,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,creature he means by that term. It is at least a question whether this
5227,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,story does not belong to the same class as the others; for whatever
5228,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,differences there may be in other respects between a 'sea-cow' and a
5229,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"dragon, it may be observed that nearly all the dragons of Northern"
5230,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,legends make their home by the sea.
5231,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
5232,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,If there is a connection between the two stories--the dragon-fight
5233,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,of Frotho I and the death of Frotho III--their origin must surely be
5234,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,sought in myth. Fróði the Peaceful (Frotho III) is the central figure
5235,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,of Danish legend and his fame became proverbial even in Germany.
5236,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Moreover, though there is no evidence that he was regarded as a god, it"
5237,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,is clear that he was the Danish counterpart of the god Frey.
5238,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
5239,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,It may not be out of place here to cite one more of Saxo's stories
5240,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"(p. 29 f.). Hadingus, the father of Frotho I, while bathing in the"
5241,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,sea off the coast of Helsingland encountered and killed a sea-monster
5242,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,of unknown species. As he was having it carried to his camp he met a
5243,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"woman who uttered a prophecy of dire woe, saying that he had killed"
5244,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,one of the deities who was wandering about in a form not his own[183].
5245,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"In order to propitiate the gods he instituted a sacrifice to Frey,"
5246,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,which was to be repeated at regular intervals and which the Swedes call
5247,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Fröblod. This story seems to take us back to the days of theriomorphic
5248,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,religion--or perhaps one should say to a time when certain marine
5249,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,animals were regarded as divine. But is it not also connected somehow
5250,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,with the story of Frotho's death?
5251,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
5252,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"We need not enter here into a discussion of these mythical stories,"
5253,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,though it may be remarked in passing that theriomorphism plays a
5254,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,very prominent part in the religious practices and conceptions of
5255,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"primitive peoples, and, what is more, that we hear not unfrequently"
5256,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,of a struggle between a god or national hero and some theriomorphic
5257,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,being whose sanctuary or attributes he appears to have taken over[184].
5258,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,But it is perhaps worth noting that in Beowulf also the hero is
5259,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,repeatedly involved in adventures with water-monsters. This feature
5260,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,is entirely absent from the story of Biarki and can hardly have a
5261,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"historical basis. What I would suggest is that it is derived, in part"
5262,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"at least, from the same group of legends which in Danish tradition are"
5263,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,centred round the names Hadingus and Frotho. But in that case there
5264,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,is considerable probability that these stories have been transferred
5265,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"to the hero from his namesake, the son of Scyld, who belongs"
5266,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,genealogically to the same group of persons.
5267,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
5268,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,This explanation will at all events account for the discrepancy between
5269,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the English and Scandinavian accounts of the hero's death[185]. Only
5270,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the latter properly comes into consideration for Beowulf the son of
5271,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Ecgtheow. For the suggested transference we have a certain analogy in
5272,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"the various incidents which are connected sometimes with one Frotho,"
5273,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,sometimes with the other. A much better case however occurs in an
5274,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"English work of later date, the Vitae Duorum Offarum. In that work"
5275,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Drida, the wife of Offa II (the Mercian king), is represented as a"
5276,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"most desperate character, and incidents are related of her which seem"
5277,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,to be totally incompatible with what we know of this queen--whose real
5278,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,name was Cynethryth--from contemporary sources. On the other hand they
5279,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,agree very well with the brief account given in Beowulf of Thrytho
5280,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the wife of Offa I (king of Angel). We may compare too the hopeless
5281,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,confusion which prevails in the chronicles with regard to Anlaf the
5282,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,son of Sihtric (Olafr Kvaran) and Anlaf the son of Guthfrith. It can
5283,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,scarcely be doubted that heroic poetry was liable to mistakes of the
5284,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"same character, although the question has scarcely received as much"
5285,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,attention as it deserves.
5286,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
5287,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,In the explanation put forward above I do not mean of course to suggest
5288,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,that the dragon of northern heroic poetry is always a distorted form
5289,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,of some marine animal. My view is that this is one of the elements
5290,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,which have contributed to the formation of the stories--playing a part
5291,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,similar to that of the crocodile in the legends of southern lands[186].
5292,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Dragons endowed with supernatural or at least unnatural characteristics
5293,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,figure in the folk-tales of many nations throughout the world; and
5294,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,such stories are by no means restricted to maritime populations. Very
5295,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"frequently no doubt they are handed on from one people to another, and"
5296,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,their currency is perhaps assisted by works of art. We have to remember
5297,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,that the word _draca_ is derived from Latin. Yet the conception itself
5298,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,is probably much older; at all events the association of such monsters
5299,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,with hoards of gold can be traced back in northern regions to a very
5300,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,remote antiquity[187].
5301,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
5302,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,As regards the origin of this association--which is clearly unnatural
5303,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,and not due in any way to the influence of marine animals--it may be
5304,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"noted that the dragon's lair is often a tomb or barrow[188], as in"
5305,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the case of the one encountered by Beowulf. An explanation of this
5306,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,phenomenon seems to be afforded by a story relating to the tomb of
5307,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Charles Martel, which is found in a number of medieval chronicles. St"
5308,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Eucherius, bishop of Orleans, in a vision saw Charles in hell, and on"
5309,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,coming to himself begged St Boniface and others to go and inspect the
5310,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,prince's burial place. On opening the tomb they saw a dragon dart out
5311,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,suddenly and found the grave all blackened as though it had been burnt
5312,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"up. Here it would seem that the dragon--a fiery dragon, like the one in"
5313,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Beowulf--was nothing else than the spirit of the dead prince, and it is"
5314,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,permissible to suspect that such was the case elsewhere. At all events
5315,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the fact that dragons are represented as inhabiting tombs is clearly to
5316,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,be taken in connection with their character as guardians of gold; for
5317,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,in early times it was customary to bury with the dead a considerable
5318,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,amount of treasure.
5319,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
5320,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,But there is another feature which deserves notice in the story of
5321,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Charles Martel's grave. The earliest document[189] in which it is found
5322,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"dates from the year 858, i.e. about a century after the incident is"
5323,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,said to have taken place. But the closing words of the account[190]
5324,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,state quite definitely that the writer or writers had known persons
5325,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,who were present at the opening of the tomb. We have thus to deal with
5326,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"evidence which is strictly second-hand, as in the case of more than"
5327,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,one remarkable story told by Bede. The explanation lies no doubt in
5328,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the fact that the men of that age did not clearly distinguish between
5329,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the supernatural and that which is merely unusual. At such a time if a
5330,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"person asserted that he had seen a fiery dragon, his statement would be"
5331,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,received doubtless with wonder but not necessarily with incredulity. As
5332,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"a matter of fact we find it stated in the Saxon Chronicle[191], _sub"
5333,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"anno_ 793, that in that year fiery dragons were seen flying in the air."
5334,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,It cannot therefore be assumed with safety either that the killer of a
5335,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,dragon must be a fictitious person or that the adventure itself must
5336,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,have been invented long after the hero's time.

5339,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
5340,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,In conclusion we have to take account of supernatural properties
5341,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,possessed by beings which in themselves are natural. As an instance we
5342,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,may take the speeches of the birds (nuthatches) which in Fáfnismál 32
5343,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,ff. warn Sigurðr of the treachery prepared for him by Reginn. Similar
5344,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,stories occur elsewhere in Old Norse literature. Absurd as this belief
5345,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,may seem we have good contemporary evidence for its existence in
5346,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Procopius' account of the Warni, which we discussed in the last chapter"
5347,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,(p. 97 f.).
5348,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
5349,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Under the same head may be mentioned the faculty ascribed to various
5350,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,persons of being able to change into wolves or bears. As instances
5351,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,we may mention the case of Sigmundr and Sinfiötli given in Völsunga
5352,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Saga, cap. 8, and the story of Biarki discussed above. For the latter"
5353,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,we have already suggested an explanation. But though the motif may
5354,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,not have been a common one in heroic poetry--as compared with sagas
5355,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,relating to the Viking Age--there can be no doubt that the belief in
5356,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,shape-changing goes back to a remote antiquity. It is of frequent
5357,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"occurrence in poems and stories dealing with the gods, while similar"
5358,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,ideas are widely prevalent among primitive peoples at the present day.
5359,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
5360,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Among other supernatural characteristics may be mentioned that of
5361,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"invulnerability, through the use of magic which rendered all weapons"
5362,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,harmless--a feature found in Beowulf (in the case of Grendel) as well
5363,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,as in later works. Often too heroes are capable of superhuman powers
5364,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"of strength or endurance, as in Beow. 377 ff., 544 ff.[192], though"
5365,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,many of these cases may be set down to mere exaggeration. On the whole
5366,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,however such characteristics are scarcely as prominent as they are in
5367,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the heroic stories of other nations.
5368,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,
5369,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,The love of the marvellous is more strikingly displayed in Procopius'
5370,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,account of Britain (_Goth._ IV 20) than in any of the poems which have
5371,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,come down to us. In the first place he says that the whole country
5372,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,beyond the great wall (i.e. the Roman Wall) was inhabited only by
5373,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"snakes and wild beasts, and that if any man ventured there he would"
5374,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,die at once from the pestilential atmosphere. Then he goes on to say
5375,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"that Britain was the dwelling place of the spirits of the dead, and"
5376,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,describes in detail how certain people who dwelt on the Frankish coast
5377,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,ferried the souls across. As to the truth of this story Procopius
5378,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,himself expresses scepticism; yet he states that he had heard it
5379,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,from numerous witnesses. It is scarcely permissible therefore to
5380,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,suppose that he had been victimised by a humorist. More probably he is
5381,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,reporting stories actually current among the Teutonic soldiery in the
5382,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Roman army, which doubtless contained adventurers from many distant"
5383,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,lands. In short we have here to do with folk-tales[193] which had
5384,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,been localised in Britain and were believed to represent its condition
5385,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,truly at the very time when Procopius was writing. It is exceedingly
5386,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"remarkable that such stories should obtain credence at a time when,"
5387,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"as we know from more than one source, there was quite a considerable"
5388,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,amount of communication between Britain and the Continent. Indeed
5389,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,Procopius himself says that large numbers of English emigrants had
5390,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,recently settled within the Frankish dominions.

5394,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,In the course of this chapter we have seen that many of
5395,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,the heroic stories contain elements derived from myth and
5396,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,folk-tale. The distinction which we have drawn between the two
5397,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,categories is that only the former deals with definite--though
5398,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,unhistorical--personalities[194]. It is commonly held that myth is
5399,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,a necessary element in heroic stories; but this is a question which
5400,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"we must reserve for discussion in the next chapter. Further, we have"
5401,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,seen that the presence of supernatural elements does not necessarily
5402,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,mean that the stories in which they occur were composed or modified
5403,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"long after the events which they relate; that, on the contrary, such"
5404,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,elements are to be found in contemporary or almost contemporary
5405,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,narratives. They must be taken as faithful reflections of the beliefs
5406,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,and ideas of an uncritical age. But it is scarcely correct to regard
5407,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,these elements as the distinctive characteristics of heroic poetry.
5408,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"Their chief domain in reality is the folk-tale, a far more primitive"
5409,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,"form of composition, which without doubt was in existence during the"
5410,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,same period. The truly distinctive characteristics of heroic poetry are
5411,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC STORIES.,rather those which differentiate it from the folk-tale.

5576,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
5577,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
5578,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,We have now to consider the question whether myth is a necessary
5579,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,element in the formation of heroic poetry. It has been noticed that
5580,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"historical persons figure in many stories of the Heroic Age, while"
5581,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,others do not contain a single character whose historical existence
5582,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,can be authenticated. These latter stories are believed to be wholly
5583,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"mythical in origin, though they may not show any supernatural features"
5584,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,in their final form. But even in stories of the former type it is held
5585,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"that some of the characters are almost always of mythical origin,"
5586,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,and that their association with historical characters is a secondary
5587,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,development--due to confusion or to poetic imagination.
5588,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
5589,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"In the last chapter we put forward the view that Beowulf, the hero"
5590,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"of the poem, has been confused with a mythical character of the same"
5591,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"name, and that the adventure with the dragon originally belonged to the"
5592,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"latter. It can scarcely be doubted that Scyld Scefing, the father of"
5593,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"this earlier Beowulf, was also a mythical character. The only element"
5594,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,in his story common to English and Scandinavian tradition is that he is
5595,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"regarded as the ancestor of the Scyldungas or Skiöldungar, the Danish"
5596,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"royal family, and all analogies suggest that he came into existence"
5597,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"as their eponymus. The brief account of him given in the poem might,"
5598,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"except in two particulars, be applied to almost any successful king of"
5599,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the Heroic Age. One exception relates to the story of the funeral ship,"
5600,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,on which the dead king's body is sent out to sea. In spite of Prof.
5601,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Olrik's doubts[195] I cannot but think that this is a reminiscence of
5602,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"ancient custom. The other is the reference to his arrival as an infant,"
5603,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,likewise by sea--a story told more fully of Sceaf in certain English
5604,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,chronicles. The only question here is between myth and folk-tale. The
5605,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"story may fairly be classed under the latter head, though I think"
5606,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,its origin is ultimately to be sought in a ritual myth. Scandinavian
5607,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"authorities, apart from Saxo[196], record nothing distinctive of"
5608,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Skiöldr, except that he was a son of Othin and the husband of the"
5609,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,goddess Gefion[197]--which again points to myth.
5610,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
5611,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,In Scyld-Skiöldr we have the case of an eponymous ancestor appearing in
5612,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the introduction to a poem which deals largely with the fortunes of his
5613,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,descendants. But there is no evidence that his own deeds ever formed
5614,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the subject of an independent heroic poem. It would be somewhat hasty
5615,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,therefore to use this case as an argument for the origin of characters
5616,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,who are brought before us in the main action of heroic poems.
5617,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
5618,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Next we may take the story of Weland, as to the mythical origin of"
5619,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,which nearly all scholars seem to be agreed. It has indeed a historical
5620,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,or semi-historical connection in the fact that Weland is represented
5621,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"as the father of Widia (Wudga), i.e. the early Gothic hero Vidigoia"
5622,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,mentioned by Jordanes (cf. p. 27); but this is held to be a secondary
5623,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,element in the story. In its original form the story is believed to
5624,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"have dealt only with the incidents related in Völundarkviða, viz. (i)"
5625,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the adventure with the swan-maidens, (ii) Weland's imprisonment by"
5626,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Nithhad and his revenge[198]. Behind the story itself however there
5627,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,lies a widespread belief in the existence of a supernatural smith of
5628,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,this name. Several places in Germany (Westphalia and Holstein) are
5629,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"reputed to be the scene of his operations, while in this country he"
5630,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"is connected with the cromlech called Wayland Smith, near Ashdown in"
5631,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Berkshire. In its ultimate origin this belief is traced to the myth of
5632,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,a fire-demon. Certainly it is to be noted that the name _Weland_ is of
5633,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,a very exceptional type--apparently participial in form. One can hardly
5634,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"help suspecting that it once had a definite meaning, though this cannot"
5635,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,now be determined with certainty[199].
5636,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
5637,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Now there can be little doubt that the adventure with the swan-maidens
5638,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,is derived from a folk-tale. In this part of the story there is no
5639,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"indication of a fire-demon, or even of a smith, while analogies for"
5640,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the incident are fairly common both in Teutonic lands and much farther
5641,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,afield. We may confine our attention therefore to the second and better
5642,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,known part--that which deals with Weland's imprisonment and revenge.
5643,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
5644,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,It is manifest that this story departs very decidedly from the ordinary
5645,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,standard of heroic poetry--firstly in the fact that the hero is here
5646,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"clearly represented as a smith, and secondly in the cruelty, treachery"
5647,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,and vindictiveness ascribed to the chief characters. These are features
5648,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,which would be in place either in myth or folk-tale. But we may note
5649,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"further that there are analogies for part of this story, just as much"
5650,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,as for the incident of the swan-maidens. As an example we may take
5651,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Saxo's account of the robbing of Mimingus by Hotherus (p. 70 f.).
5652,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Mimingus is a _satyrus_, i.e. clearly either an elf or dwarf, who"
5653,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,dwells in a cave in an almost inaccessible forest. Hotherus surprises
5654,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,and binds him and then takes away his sword and a magical ring. A
5655,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"connection between the two stories is shown even in the name, for"
5656,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Weland's most famous sword is called Mimming[200]. For a more remote
5657,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,parallel we may compare the story of Loki and Andvari. Indeed the
5658,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"spoiling of a dwarf is quite a common motif in Northern tales, while at"
5659,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the same time such beings are constantly credited with extraordinary
5660,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"skill in metallurgy. The distinctive feature in the story of Weland,"
5661,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"apart from the revenge, is that sympathy is on the side of the smith."
5662,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
5663,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,It is the end of the story--where Weland (Völundr) rises into the air
5664,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,and flies away--that is supposed to point most clearly to a fire-myth.
5665,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,But this feature cannot be traced except in the Norse version[201].
5666,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Moreover here we have also the adventure with the flying swan-maidens,"
5667,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,in whose case there is no suspicion of such a myth. Setting aside this
5668,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,incident the story is perfectly explicable as a folk-tale founded on
5669,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,actual experience. There can be no doubt that in the Heroic Age--and
5670,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,indeed in much earlier times--princes were especially anxious to obtain
5671,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"slaves, whether foreigners or not, who were skilled in metallurgy. And"
5672,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,it is by no means incredible that such slaves were sometimes lamed in
5673,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"order to prevent any attempt at escape--although, quite apart from this"
5674,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"explanation, smith's work may be regarded as a vocation natural to the"
5675,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"lame man, just as minstrelsy to the blind. Further, it is likely enough"
5676,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"that servile smiths, when cruelly treated, would take any opportunity"
5677,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,that presented itself of avenging themselves on their masters. For
5678,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the murder of Nithhad's sons we have a somewhat striking historical
5679,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"parallel in Eugippus' Life of St Severinus (cap. 8). Feletheus, king of"
5680,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the Rugii, who were settled on the Danube in the time of Odoacer, had a"
5681,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,young son who one day was entrapped by some goldsmiths in the queen's
5682,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,service. They threatened to take his life; but the saint intervened and
5683,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,rescued the boy on condition of the smiths obtaining their freedom[202].
5684,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
5685,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,What seems to me to be really the most remarkable feature in the
5686,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,story is that a person in this position should come to be made the
5687,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,subject of heroic or semi-heroic poetry; for it is plain enough from
5688,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"many sources, especially Saxo's History, that smiths were generally"
5689,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,regarded with deep aversion. In Deor's Elegy Weland is said to be a
5690,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,more distinguished man than Nithhad; in Völundarkviða he is called a
5691,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"chief of the elves, while the introduction makes him the son of a king"
5692,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"of the Finns. Yet, except in the late Thiðreks Saga, his father's name"
5693,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"is never given, and none of our authorities credit him with possessing"
5694,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,a following of his own.
5695,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
5696,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Now is there any real necessity for the assumption that Weland's
5697,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,relationship to Widia is a secondary development? It is found in two
5698,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"of the three national versions of the story[203], and hence dates back"
5699,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,in all probability at least to the sixth century. It is not found in
5700,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the Völundarkviða; but then Widia is altogether forgotten or unknown in
5701,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Northern tradition. Moreover there is a distinct reference to offspring
5702,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,of Weland and Beaduhild at the end of the poem. Once grant that the
5703,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,relationship is old and the reason for the heroic treatment of the
5704,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,story becomes obvious. It is merely the reflection of the son's fame
5705,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,upon the father. As Widia is never said to be the son of anyone else
5706,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the probability is that he was supposed to be illegitimate, and that a"
5707,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,story was soon current as to his being the offspring of a union between
5708,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,a princess and a bondsmith. In such a case there would be a natural
5709,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,tendency to the accumulation of material from folk-tales about his
5710,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,parentage.
5711,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
5712,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,If this view is correct the story must of course come originally
5713,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,from the Goths or some neighbouring people. I cannot see that the
5714,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Westphalian traditions are any more conclusive than the Berkshire
5715,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,cromlech as to its original home. If Weland was a character of
5716,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"folk-tale and his name had at one time a definite meaning, these"
5717,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,local traditions may have been quite independent of the heroic story.
5718,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,The real difficulty seems to me to lie in determining the amount of
5719,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,material from folk-tale contained in the latter. We need not entertain
5720,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,any doubt as to the adventure with the swan-maidens. But what about
5721,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Nithhad and Beaduhild? The latter name is not obviously framed to suit
5722,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the character or circumstances of the unfortunate princess. _Nithhad_
5723,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,might be explained more easily in this way; yet a Gothic prince of
5724,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,that name is recorded by Jordanes (cap. 22). At all events there is
5725,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,no conclusive evidence in either case that these characters did not
5726,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,originally belong to the story of Widia.
5727,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
5728,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Another story which is believed to be of wholly mythical origin is
5729,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,that of Heðinn and Högni. In Kûdrûn it appears as the introduction to
5730,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"a much longer story, from which point of view it bears a superficial"
5731,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,resemblance to the story of Scyld and possibly to that of Weland. But
5732,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,since this feature is peculiar to the German poem and the second story
5733,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"seems to be entirely unknown from other sources, we can hardly do"
5734,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,otherwise than treat the story of Heðinn and Högni as an independent
5735,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,narrative.
5736,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
5737,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,This must have been one of the most popular stories of the Heroic
5738,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Age, since it can be traced in England, as well as in Germany and the"
5739,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,North. None of the characters however can be traced in any historical
5740,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"work[204], and the time to which it refers is quite uncertain. The"
5741,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Northern version of the story contains a supernatural element in the
5742,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,endless battle which forms its conclusion. It is generally held that
5743,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"this is the oldest element in the story and that Hild, whose name means"
5744,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"'war,' was really a valkyrie. The whole story then is to be regarded"
5745,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,as a myth of 'unceasing strife between conflicting powers[205].' But
5746,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"we may naturally ask whether it is truly scientific, when dealing"
5747,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"with a story known from three separate national traditions, to regard"
5748,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,as the original element a feature found in only one of the three. It
5749,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"may be urged of course that the reconciliation, which in Kûdrûn[206]"
5750,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"takes the place of the tragic ending found in the Northern version,"
5751,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,rendered it necessary to drop the mythical element; and again that we
5752,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,have extremely little information about the English form of the story.
5753,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,The latter remark is certainly true; but the little that we do know
5754,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,practically precludes the possibility of a mythical interpretation.
5755,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Strictly speaking the passage in Deor's Elegy (cf. p. 56) is not a
5756,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"reference to the story at all, but a matter of fact statement by the"
5757,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"poet that he had been in the service of the Heodeningas. Hence, in"
5758,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"view of the fact that this passage--together with Widsith, v. 21--is"
5759,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"probably by far the earliest reference to the story which we possess,"
5760,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,I cannot regard the mythical interpretation as anything more than an
5761,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,extremely doubtful hypothesis[207].
5762,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
5763,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,*       *       *       *       *
5764,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
5765,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Thus far we have been dealing with stories which are supposed to be
5766,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,of entirely mythical origin. Now we have to consider certain cases in
5767,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,which elements undoubtedly historical are believed to be blended with
5768,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,myth. As examples of this type we may take the stories of Waldhere and
5769,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Sigurðr. In both cases the historical elements are practically the same.
5770,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
5771,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,In the former case it should be mentioned that the mythical theory is
5772,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,by no means universally accepted. Those scholars however who do adopt
5773,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,this interpretation base their view upon a supposed connection between
5774,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the story of Waldhere and that of Heðinn and Högni. The chief points of
5775,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,resemblance between the two are as follows: (i) The heroine is called
5776,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"in the one case Hiltgund (Hildegyth), in the other Hildr (Hild). (ii)"
5777,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Both stories deal with abduction (so-called) and then with fighting.
5778,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"(iii) The man (Waldhere, Heðinn) who carries off the girl has in both"
5779,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,cases to fight with a man called Hagen or Högni. (iv) In both cases the
5780,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,combatants have previously been friends--though strictly this feature
5781,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,applies only to the Northern version of the Heðinn story. Now the
5782,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,first consideration carries no weight at all; for half the feminine
5783,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,names which occur in Anglo-Saxon heroic poetry contain the element
5784,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"_-hild-_ (e.g. _Beaduhild_, _Hildeburg_), while in the Continental and"
5785,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Scandinavian authorities also they are extremely common. Again, the"
5786,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"last consideration obviously has little validity, except when taken"
5787,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,in conjunction with the other two. But these (the second and third)
5788,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"points of resemblance are, it seems to me, altogether misleading."
5789,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,To begin with it is hardly correct to apply the term 'abduction' to
5790,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"an escape of hostages, such as the story of Waldhere relates; at"
5791,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,all events the conditions have nothing in common. Then the fight
5792,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"which follows is not, as in the case of Heðinn and Högni, with an"
5793,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"aggrieved father, or indeed with a pursuing force of any kind; it is an"
5794,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"unprovoked attack made by a third party in the hope of plunder. Lastly,"
5795,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the part played by the person called Hagen (Högni) is quite different
5796,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,in the two cases. In one he is the injured father who is wholly
5797,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,responsible for the fight; in the other he is a vassal of Gunther
5798,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"(Guthhere), who is only drawn into it, with great reluctance, through"
5799,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the obligation of avenging his nephew (Patufrit), who has already been"
5800,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,slain.
5801,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
5802,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,It is true that a different version of the story appears in Thiðreks
5803,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Saga af Bern[208]. Here Högni (Hagen) is represented as pursuing the
5804,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"fugitives on behalf of Attila, while Guthhere does not appear. Now it"
5805,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,has been widely assumed that this version is an independent and more
5806,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"original form of the story than that contained in Ekkehard's work, in"
5807,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,spite of the fact that it does not make its appearance till nearly
5808,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,three centuries after the latter--and probably nearly six centuries
5809,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,after the composition of the Anglo-Saxon poem. But the lapse of time in
5810,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"itself provides a perfectly adequate explanation of such divergencies,"
5811,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,especially if we bear in mind the unfavourable conditions under which
5812,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the heroic stories were preserved in Germany during the early Middle
5813,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Ages. As the stories gradually became forgotten two tendencies are
5814,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,constantly observable: (i) to connect stories or incidents which
5815,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"originally were quite distinct, (ii) within the individual story to"
5816,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,lose sight of all except the outstanding characters and incidents.
5817,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Hence it is only in accordance with what we might expect that two
5818,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,different sets of opponents of the hero should be confused. For a
5819,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,parallel we may compare the late North German ballad on Eormenric's
5820,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"death (cf. p. 9), which describes how Theodric with eleven companions"
5821,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,broke into the king's castle and slew him. It is generally agreed that
5822,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,this ballad is due to confusion of some kind with the story of Hamðir
5823,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"and Sörli[209], who were likewise enemies of Eormenric, though not"
5824,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,connected in any way with Theodric.
5825,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
5826,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,The saga itself really contains evidence which points to an earlier
5827,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,form of the story agreeing with that given by Ekkehard. For the hero
5828,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"is called Valtari af Vaskasteini[210], and there can be no doubt that"
5829,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,this expression is to be explained by the rocky defile mentioned by
5830,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Ekkehard (v. 490 ff.) in the Vosges (_saltus Vosagus_)--on the confines
5831,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,of Guthhere's dominions. Further it is to be noted that the story is
5832,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"introduced as an episode in the relations of Theodric and Eormenric,"
5833,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,and that the hero is represented as a nephew of the last named. All
5834,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,scholars are agreed that this is due to late combination--and no doubt
5835,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,rightly. Yet Waldhere is associated with Theodric and Eormenric also in
5836,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"a number of German poems which are quite independent of the saga, and"
5837,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,consequently it is by no means improbable that these combinations both
5838,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,preceded and helped to bring about the disappearance of Guthhere from
5839,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the story.
5840,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
5841,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,In its earlier form the affinities of the story with that of Heðinn and
5842,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Högni are, as we have seen, scarcely worth consideration. Yet apart"
5843,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,from this supposed connection there is no case for believing it to have
5844,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,a mythical foundation--except the assumption that myth is a necessary
5845,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,ingredient in every heroic story. Whether it is to be regarded as
5846,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,history or fiction is of course quite a different question and one
5847,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,which we shall have to consider later.
5848,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
5849,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Of all the stories of the Heroic Age probably none has been more
5850,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,frequently referred to a mythical origin than that which deals with
5851,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Sigurðr (Siegfried). It is held by the great majority of scholars
5852,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,that the Nibelungenlied and the corresponding Edda poems--or rather
5853,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the earlier poems or legends on which both were based--came into
5854,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,existence through the amalgamation of an essentially mythical story
5855,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,with historical traditions of Attila and the fall of the Burgundian
5856,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,kingdom[211]. The original elements of the former are believed to have
5857,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,been as follows: A young prince is brought up by a cunning smith in
5858,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"a forest, away from his father's home. On reaching manhood he gains"
5859,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,an immense treasure by killing a dragon; also he releases a maiden
5860,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"by overcoming difficulties and dangers, by fire or water, which were"
5861,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,insurmountable to any other person. These two adventures are connected
5862,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"by many scholars. Later, the hero falls into the hands of foes, who"
5863,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,slay him and take for themselves his wife and treasure.
5864,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
5865,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,It is held that this story was originally a myth of light and
5866,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,darkness--applying however to the course of the year as well as to
5867,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,that of the day. Sigurðr himself is a 'light-hero' and Brynhildr
5868,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"a 'sun-maiden' whom he releases at the dawn, while the treasure"
5869,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,represents the blossoms of summer which the light-hero likewise wins
5870,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"by destroying the dragon of winter. Then, in the evening or autumn, he"
5871,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,has to yield to the powers of darkness or winter. The original name
5872,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"of these powers was Niflungar or Nibelunge, a name connected with Old"
5873,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Norse _nifl_, 'mist,' _Niflheimr_, 'Hades.' Their chief representative"
5874,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"is Högni or Hagen, who, like Sigurðr and Brynhildr, belongs to the"
5875,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,mythical elements of the story. Many scholars also hold that the
5876,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,powers which destroyed the hero and appropriated his wife and treasure
5877,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,were originally identical with those from which he had won them at
5878,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the beginning; and this view seems to be more or less involved by the
5879,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"interpretation given above, since day and night, winter and summer are"
5880,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,constantly alternating with one another.
5881,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
5882,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Now it will be obvious at once that the story as thus reconstructed
5883,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,differs greatly from both the forms in which it has come down to us.
5884,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Indeed the only original feature preserved in both versions is the
5885,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,slaying of the dragon by Sigurðr. But it is only in the Norse version
5886,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,that the hero gains the treasure thereby; in the Nibelungenlied this
5887,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"is obtained by a different encounter, with two princes named Schilbung"
5888,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"and Nibelung, while in the Seyfridslied it really belonged to certain"
5889,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"dwarfs, the sons of Nybling[212]. Again, only the Norse version"
5890,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,records that Sigurðr released Brynhildr--from a perpetual sleep with
5891,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,which she had been punished; the incident is not connected with the
5892,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,dragon adventure. The Seyfridslied does relate that the hero rescued
5893,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"a maiden from a dragon; but here the maiden is Kriemhild, whom the"
5894,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"dragon has carried off from her home. Further, it is only in the German"
5895,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,version that Hagen kills the hero. In the Norse version the actual
5896,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"perpetrator of the deed is Gutthormr, but the instigator is Brynhildr"
5897,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"herself. Lastly, neither version of the story makes Brynhildr or the"
5898,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"treasure return to their former owners, although--in the German version"
5899,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,only--the first owners of the treasure bear the same name as those into
5900,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,whose possession it comes after the hero's death.
5901,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
5902,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,It appears then that the original form of this story has been greatly
5903,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"obscured in both versions. The explanation given is that, through"
5904,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"confusion with a historical tradition, the Burgundian kings, Gunnarr"
5905,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"(Gunther) and his brothers, have taken the place (as well as the name)"
5906,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"of the Niflungar. Hence, in order to form a just estimate of the theory"
5907,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,it is necessary to examine the various mythical characters separately.
5908,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"These are--in addition to the dragon--Brynhildr, Sigurðr and the"
5909,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Niflungar, including Högni."
5910,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
5911,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,The evidence for believing that Brynhildr was originally a mythical
5912,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,character lies chiefly[213] in the identification of her with the
5913,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"valkyrie Sigrdrífa (cf. p. 13), who is mentioned only in the Norse"
5914,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,version. The identity of the two characters is clearly recognised in
5915,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the Helreið Brynhildar and also in the prose authorities. On the other
5916,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"hand it is not recognised in Grípisspá, which is supposed to be a late"
5917,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"work, while the other poems leave it uncertain. The evidence therefore"
5918,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,on the whole is not very strong.
5919,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
5920,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"In the case of Sigurðr the evidence, apart from the valkyrie incident,"
5921,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,rests upon his being the slayer of the dragon. But it is agreed that
5922,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,this part of the story must be connected with the similar adventure
5923,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,attributed by Beowulf to Sigemund (Sigmundr); so that the question at
5924,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,issue is whether the exploit was first related of the father or the
5925,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,son. We have already seen (p. 123) that the argument in favour of the
5926,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,latter based on the agreement of the Norse and German authorities is
5927,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,in reality misleading. Hence the balance of probability is in favour
5928,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,of believing that the incident has been transferred to Sigurðr from
5929,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Sigemund.
5930,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
5931,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,In the case of the Niflungar the evidence depends upon the
5932,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,interpretation of the name. The use of the name is certainly somewhat
5933,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,curious. In the Seyfridslied (Part II) the dwarfs are called sons
5934,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,of Nybling. In the first half of the Nibelungenlied Nibelung is the
5935,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"name of one of the brothers slain by Siegfried in his youth, while"
5936,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the people who become subject to him, together with the treasure,"
5937,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"on the death of the brothers, are collectively called Nibelunge. In"
5938,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the latter half of the poem however the same name is applied to the
5939,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Burgundians. In the Norse version _Niflungar_ always means Gunnarr and
5940,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"his people (i.e. the Burgundians), except perhaps in the expressions"
5941,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"_arfi Niflunga_, _hodd Niflunga_ (in Atlakviða), by which the prose"
5942,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,authorities at all events understood the treasure which Sigurðr had
5943,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,taken from Fáfnir. The explanation given for this double use of the
5944,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,name is as follows. Originally it belonged to the mythical enemies of
5945,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Sigurðr, i.e. Högni and his people--whether these were identical with"
5946,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the former owners of the treasure or not. Later, when Högni became"
5947,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"associated with the historical Burgundian kings (Gunnarr etc.), the"
5948,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,use of the term was extended so as to embrace them also. But it is
5949,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,to be observed that the interpretation of the name _Niflungar_ as
5950,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,'children of mist' or 'darkness' is not free from difficulty. In the
5951,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Edda it is twice written _Hniflung-_[214], and on both occasions the"
5952,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"_H-_ alliterates, whereas alliteration with _n-_ is never found. This"
5953,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,fact suggests that the original form of the name was _Hniflungar_ and
5954,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,that the form without _H-_ is due to later influence--presumably on the
5955,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"part of scribes--from German sources, where of course the _H-_ (before"
5956,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,_-n-_) would regularly be lost at a much earlier date. If so the name
5957,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"cannot originally have had any connection with O. Norse _nifl_, etc."
5958,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
5959,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,In all these three cases then the evidence for the mythological
5960,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,interpretation of the story seems to be at best inconclusive. But
5961,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,we have yet to consider the case of Högni; and here it must be
5962,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,remarked that the demonic character of Högni is quite essential
5963,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,to the mythological theory. In the Norse version Gutthormr is a
5964,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,mere instrument and the person really responsible for the murder
5965,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,is Brynhildr herself--a feature obviously incompatible with the
5966,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,interpretation which we are discussing. Högni's mythical origin is as
5967,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,necessary for this interpretation as that of Sigurðr or Brynhildr. In
5968,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,order to maintain the theory the mythical character must be vindicated
5969,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,in all three cases alike.
5970,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
5971,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Now it has been remarked that Hagen (_Haguno_, _Hagano_ etc.) is"
5972,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,not uncommon as a personal name even in quite early times. This is
5973,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,a curious fact if the name had such associations[215]. But there
5974,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,is a much more serious difficulty. It is altogether contrary to
5975,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,reason or probability to separate Hagen the vassal of Gunther in
5976,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the Nibelungenlied from Hagen the vassal of the same Gunther in the
5977,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,story of Waldhere. His character in the two cases is certainly quite
5978,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,different. He is brave in both; but in the former he is both faithless
5979,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"and cruel, whereas in the latter he is an honourable man who is"
5980,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,reluctantly drawn by circumstances into a course of action of which
5981,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,he heartily disapproves. But this is precisely the character borne by
5982,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Högni in the Norse version of the story of Sigurðr--a fact which is
5983,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the more remarkable since this type of character is extremely rare in
5984,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,heroic poetry. The agreement between the story of Waldhere and the
5985,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Norse version seem to me to render it overwhelmingly probable that the
5986,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,character which they ascribe to Högni was that which he originally bore.
5987,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
5988,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,I am not arguing now to prove that Högni was a historical person. He
5989,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,may be of fictitious origin or even mythical (though the latter seems
5990,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,to me extremely improbable). But if so clearly he must have been taken
5991,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"either from the story of Sigurðr into that of Waldhere, or from the"
5992,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,story of Waldhere into that of Sigurðr. Which of the two he belonged
5993,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,to originally is a question of minor importance. The essential point
5994,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,is that an earlier German form of the story of Sigurðr must be the
5995,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,link between the Norse version and the story of Waldhere; for there is
5996,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,no evidence that the story of Waldhere itself was ever known in the
5997,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,North. The conclusion to which we are naturally brought is that in this
5998,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,earlier German form of the story Högni bore the same character which is
5999,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,attributed to him in the Norse version. This character however is of
6000,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"course totally incompatible with a demonic origin; and here, it seems"
6001,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"to me, the interpretation which we are discussing hopelessly breaks"
6002,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,down.
6003,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6004,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,I cannot help thinking that the investigation of the whole story has
6005,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,been greatly prejudiced by the application of wrong methods. There
6006,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,can be no doubt that a story of some kind--in which the adventures of
6007,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Sigurðr were already combined with those of the historical Burgundian
6008,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,princes--was in existence long before the date of the earliest
6009,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"extant records, and that from this story, whether it was embodied in"
6010,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"a single poem or consisted only of a mass of lays or legends, both"
6011,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the Norse and German versions are ultimately derived. It seems to me
6012,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"that, before trying to ascertain the origin of the various elements"
6013,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"contained in the story, the object should be to determine the main"
6014,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,features of this common foundation. The way to achieve this end is
6015,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,surely not by arbitrarily selecting one feature from the Norse version
6016,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"and another from the German, but by bringing together all the various"
6017,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,features which the two have in common. To carry out such a process
6018,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"systematically would be quite beyond the scope of this book, but a"
6019,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,brief outline of the scheme may not be out of place here.
6020,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6021,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,First then we will take the part of the story relating to the hero's
6022,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"early adventures, which is preserved mainly in a different set of"
6023,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,authorities from the rest. The chief German authority is the late
6024,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Seyfridslied which, as we have seen, is really made up of two"
6025,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"different ballads, inconsistent with one another. The Nibelungenlied"
6026,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"contains only allusions to this part of the story, the action proper"
6027,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,beginning shortly before the hero's arrival at Worms. The Norse version
6028,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"is given in the trilogy, Reginsmál, Fáfnismál and Sigrdrífumál, as well"
6029,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"as in Völsunga Saga, which is derived from these poems. The account"
6030,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,given in Thiðreks Saga is mainly a combination of the German and Norse
6031,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"versions, though it has one or two features peculiar to itself."
6032,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6033,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,In this part of the story the common elements are very few in number.
6034,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,(1) Sigurðr kills a dragon; (2) Sigurðr gains a great treasure.
6035,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"In the Norse version the two adventures are combined, but in the"
6036,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Nibelungenlied the treasure belonged to Nibelung and his brother
6037,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,who had quarrelled and who are both killed by the hero. It may be
6038,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,noticed that Reginn and Fáfnir are also brothers who have quarrelled
6039,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"over a treasure, and they too are both killed by Sigurðr; but Fáfnir"
6040,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"has become a dragon--or perhaps a reptile. The Seyfridslied, Part I"
6041,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"mentions only the killing of a dragon (serpent), while Part II unites"
6042,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the acquisition of the treasure with the killing of a dragon--a fiery
6043,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,dragon--but states that the hero erroneously thought that the treasure
6044,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,belonged to the dragon. Really it belonged to the three sons of the
6045,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"dwarf-king Nybling, who are friendly to the hero and not killed by"
6046,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,him. As a further common element we may mention (3) that Sigurðr
6047,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"is brought up by a smith. This story is found in the Seyfridslied,"
6048,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Part I, and in Thiðreks Saga--practically also in the Edda, since"
6049,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Reginn is represented as a smith. Again, (4) both in the ballad"
6050,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"and in Norse prose authorities Sigurðr breaks the smith's anvil,"
6051,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,though the circumstances are quite different. It is doubtful whether
6052,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"we should connect the eating of Fáfnir's heart, which enabled the"
6053,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"hero to understand the birds, with the German story that he became"
6054,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"invulnerable by bathing in the dragon's blood. Further, we have seen"
6055,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,that the awakening of the valkyrie in Sigrdrífumál has practically
6056,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,nothing in common with the rescue of the maiden (Kriemhild) from the
6057,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"dragon related in the ballad (Part II). Lastly, it is to be observed"
6058,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,that though the hero's father has the same name (Sigemund) in all
6059,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"authorities, there is great discrepancy as to his childhood. In the"
6060,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Edda he is posthumous but knows his parentage, in the Nibelungenlied"
6061,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"he is brought up at his father's court, in the ballad, Part I, he"
6062,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"leaves his home and goes to the smithy, in Part II and Thiðreks Saga"
6063,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,he does not know his parentage--in the latter indeed he is a foundling
6064,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,and suckled by a hind. It will be seen that this part of the story is
6065,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,permeated throughout by the supernatural and marvellous.
6066,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6067,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,From the time of the hero's arrival at the Burgundian court we may
6068,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"take the Nibelungenlied for the German version, while the Norse one is"
6069,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,best represented by the poems from the fragmentary Sigurðarkviða I to
6070,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Atlamál. For the earlier portion we have also to use Völsunga Saga and
6071,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the prose Edda in place of certain poems which are lost (cf. p. 13). In
6072,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,this part of the story the elements common to the two versions are far
6073,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,more numerous and striking. (1) Sigurðr comes to the Rhineland (Worms
6074,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"in the German version) and marries a sister (Guðrún, Kriemhild) of King"
6075,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Gunnarr (Gunther). (2) Sigurðr in supernatural disguise wins Brynhildr
6076,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,for Gunnarr. (3) Sigurðr again in supernatural disguise sleeps with
6077,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Brynhildr and takes from her a ring[216]. (4) Brynhildr quarrels with
6078,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Sigurðr's wife, and the latter shows her the ring[216]. (5) Brynhildr"
6079,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,bitterly resents the treatment she has received and devises the hero's
6080,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,death. (6) Sigurðr is killed by treachery; but the versions differ in
6081,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,regard to the perpetrator of the deed. (7) The hero's widow is for a
6082,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"long time irreconcilable, but eventually is married to Atli (Etzel)."
6083,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,(8) Gunnarr with Högni and many others are invited to Atli's home. (9)
6084,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,The gold is sunk in the Rhine. (10) Gunnarr and Högni are captured
6085,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,alive and the rest killed in Atli's land. (11) A demand for the gold is
6086,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,made and refused. (12) Gunnarr and Högni are killed.
6087,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6088,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,It will be seen that the supernatural is here confined to (2) and (3);
6089,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,indeed these are almost the only incidents in which it occurs in this
6090,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,part of the story. There is a difference between the two versions in
6091,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,regard to the character of the supernatural disguise. In the Norse
6092,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"version, where the two incidents are combined, Sigurðr and Gunnarr have"
6093,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"exchanged forms; in the German Gunther is present in both cases, though"
6094,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Siegfried, who has rendered himself invisible, is the real actor."
6095,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Several other important differences between the two versions have
6096,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,already been noted (p. 13 f.). In addition to these each version has of
6097,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,course many characters and incidents peculiar to itself.
6098,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6099,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Of the discrepancies enumerated on p. 13 f. the fifth is by far the
6100,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"most important, since Kriemhild's revenge for Siegfried forms the"
6101,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,central motif of the second half of the Nibelungenlied. In the Norse
6102,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,version no such central motif is to be found. In the prose piece
6103,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Dráp Niflunga Atli's conduct is attributed to revenge for the death
6104,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"of Brynhildr, while in Völsunga Saga it is ascribed to his lust for"
6105,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Sigurðr's gold. But in the poems themselves no real explanation is
6106,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"given, and the connection between this part of the story and that"
6107,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,relating to Sigurðr is scarcely more than a personal one--viz. that
6108,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Guðrún, Gunnarr and Högni figure in both. This however is a phenomenon"
6109,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"for which parallels are to be found in other heroic stories, e.g."
6110,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,those of Beowulf and Weland. It is now held--and doubtless rightly--by
6111,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the majority of scholars that the unity of interest imparted to
6112,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the Nibelungenlied by the motif of Kriemhild's revenge is a later
6113,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,improvement on the somewhat disconnected story given in the Edda. For
6114,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"our present purpose however the question is immaterial, since it is not"
6115,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,contended that this part of the story is of mythical origin.
6116,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6117,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,In spite of the discrepancies noted above it cannot be denied that
6118,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the two versions contain a remarkable number of identical features in
6119,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,this part of the story--a fact which renders all the more striking the
6120,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,very slight amount of agreement in the part dealing with the hero's
6121,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,early adventures. Unless all analogies are misleading the conclusion to
6122,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,which we are driven is that the original story began more or less where
6123,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the Nibelungenlied begins, and that the hero's youthful adventures"
6124,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"are later accretions, such as we see gathering round the childhood or"
6125,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"ancestry of other heroes, e.g. Biarki (cf. p. 120). We may add also the"
6126,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"cases of Starkaðr, Hagen in Kûdrûn and perhaps Witege (cf. p. 135)."
6127,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"They appear to be derived, in part at least, from folk-tales. One of"
6128,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,these--affecting probably only the Norse version--may be identified
6129,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"with the Scandinavian story of Svipdagr and Menglöð (cf. p. 12), a"
6130,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,variety perhaps of that of the Sleeping Beauty. Another is that of the
6131,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,forest dwarf who forges or preserves a magical sword. We may note
6132,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"that in Thiðreks Saga the smith is called Mimir, a name which recalls"
6133,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Saxo's Mimingus (cf. p. 133)[217]. The story of the treasure-guarding
6134,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"dragon may also be included in this category, though strictly perhaps"
6135,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,it belongs rather to popular belief than to folk-tale. From the fact
6136,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,that some of these elements are common to both versions we may probably
6137,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,infer that the process of accretion had begun before the story reached
6138,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the North. Yet there do seem to be some indications of a reflex
6139,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,influence[218]--from the North or some region exposed to Northern
6140,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,influence--upon the development of the story in Germany.
6141,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6142,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,In addition to folk-tales we must take into consideration also a
6143,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,tendency which is often associated with them--the desire to account for
6144,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,an obscure name. This seems to be the most reasonable explanation of
6145,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the names _Nibelung_ and _Nibelunge_ in the first part of the German
6146,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,epic and _Nybling_ in the ballad--all denoting the original owners of
6147,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the treasure. We have seen that in the Norse version, as well as in the"
6148,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"latter half of the Nibelungenlied, _Niflungar_ means the Burgundians."
6149,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,May we not suppose that it was really a dynastic name[219] like
6150,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"_Scyldungas_, _Uffingas_, _Merewioingas_? In that case of course _hodd"
6151,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Niflunga_ (_hort der Nibelunge_) ought to mean the family treasure of
6152,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the Burgundian kings. But is it quite certain that Atlakviða does not
6153,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,use it in this sense? That it is identified with Fáfnir's treasure in
6154,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,later authorities may be due to subsequent German influence. As for
6155,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the fact that the name _Nibelunge_ is used for the Burgundians only
6156,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"in the second half of the German epic, may not this spring from some"
6157,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,stylistic peculiarities of the 'common foundation'? It is not necessary
6158,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,to suppose that the latter was all the work of one author or even of
6159,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,one generation.
6160,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6161,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,In dealing with questions such as these we cannot hope to get beyond a
6162,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"reasonable hypothesis, since the paucity of common features between"
6163,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the two versions admits of few definite conclusions. But from the
6164,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,time when the hero arrives at the Burgundian court the case is quite
6165,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,different. In spite of certain discrepancies there is no difficulty in
6166,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,determining the main outline of the story. Even in the most important
6167,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,point of all--the true cause of the hero's death--the two versions are
6168,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"really in full agreement. Gutthormr does the deed in one version, Hagen"
6169,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,in the other; but in both alike it arises out of the bitter resentment
6170,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"cherished by Brynhildr, owing to the deception which has been practised"
6171,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,upon her. We have seen that this motif is incompatible with the current
6172,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"mythological interpretation of the story. But more than this, it is"
6173,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"plainly not a motif derived from mythology at all, but from real life."
6174,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6175,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,It must not be overlooked that the Brynhildr and Högni of the Norse
6176,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,version are in the nature of character-studies. Both appeal to our
6177,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"sympathies, though we do not approve of the actions which they commit"
6178,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,or allow. Here we are in a region of thought as alien as possible to
6179,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"that of the folk-tale. But it is also alien to that period of thought,"
6180,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"which was most open to the influence of folk-tales, the period which we"
6181,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,have called Stage III in the history of German poetry. In such a period
6182,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the person who destroyed the hero must necessarily be a villain as
6183,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"black as Hell. Between the instigator of the deed and the perpetrator,"
6184,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,who by this time was Hagen--whether this was so originally or not is
6185,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"immaterial--the choice was made, not unnaturally in the circumstances,"
6186,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"in favour of the latter, while the former was allowed, awkwardly"
6187,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"enough, to drop out of the story. Thus the peculiarities of the German"
6188,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,version may be explained quite naturally as modifications of an earlier
6189,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,form similar to the other--modifications necessitated by the conditions
6190,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,under which heroic poetry was preserved in Germany. The effect produced
6191,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,is somewhat similar to that which would be obtained by converting a
6192,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,modern problem play into a popular melodrama.
6193,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6194,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,The conclusion then to which we are brought is that the supposed
6195,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"traces of myth, so far as they have any foundation at all, are due"
6196,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"to late accretions to the story, while the central motif in both"
6197,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"versions alike is by no means of a mythical character, but essentially"
6198,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,human. Consequently the story of Sigurðr stands quite on a line with
6199,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the other stories of the Heroic Age. Most of them contain elements
6200,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,which may be interpreted as mythical; but these elements are always
6201,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,most prominent in the latest forms of the story. It must not escape
6202,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,notice that those scholars who most strongly uphold the mythical
6203,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,interpretation base their arguments chiefly on such works as the
6204,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Seyfridslied and Thiðreks Saga af Bern. The explanation is that
6205,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,myth is a growth which requires time to develop. Even Beowulf is no
6206,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"real exception to the general rule, for in the latter part the hero"
6207,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,is probably confused with a namesake whose story may have been of
6208,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"considerable antiquity, while the only character in the poem who is"
6209,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,quite clearly of mythical origin is the first ancestor of the Danish
6210,MYTHICAL ELEMENTS IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,royal family[220].

6343,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6344,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6345,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,The question how far the use of fiction was permitted in heroic poetry
6346,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,is of course one to which we cannot possibly hope to give a definite
6347,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,answer. All poetry which deserves the name claims to do something
6348,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,more than provide a bare record of facts. According to the ancient
6349,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,definition[221] its proper function is to express the universal rather
6350,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,than the particular--what may happen or may have happened rather
6351,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,than what has happened. Some freedom of play for the imagination is
6352,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,therefore essential. These remarks hold good for early Teutonic poetry
6353,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,just as much as for Greek. If we could recover the poems recited in
6354,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Attila's presence (cf. p. 84) we should doubtless find that they
6355,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,contained far more than a mere statement of facts. In the works which
6356,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,have come down to us however the degree to which freedom is allowed
6357,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,to the imagination varies very greatly from case to case. Thus in the
6358,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,poem on the battle of Brunanburh it is restricted within comparatively
6359,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"narrow limits, while in the almost contemporaneous Hákonarmál the"
6360,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,historical fact on which the poem is based is very largely obscured by
6361,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,a wholly fictitious narrative. We may naturally expect that the authors
6362,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"of heroic poems likewise differed in the treatment of their subjects,"
6363,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,though not necessarily to the same degree.
6364,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6365,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,As an instance of a poem which obviously contains a large amount of
6366,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,fiction we can hardly do better than take the Anglo-Saxon Widsith. The
6367,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"greater part of this poem consists, as we have seen, of a speech by a"
6368,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,minstrel enumerating the various peoples and princes with whom he was
6369,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,acquainted. Amongst others he states that he had visited the Gothic
6370,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"king Eormenric (who died before 375), the Burgundian king Guthhere"
6371,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,(who died about 437) and the Langobardic king Aelfwine (who died about
6372,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"572). Now it is commonly held that the poem is of composite formation,"
6373,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,and there can be little doubt that additions have been made to it from
6374,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,time to time. This will account for statements such as those given
6375,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"above and, though it does not prevent them from being fictitious, it"
6376,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,may enable us to form some idea as to how fiction was used. Poets of
6377,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the seventh century probably possessed no chronological tables, and"
6378,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,consequently they may not have been aware that the foreign princes of
6379,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,whom they were speaking belonged to quite different ages. Yet without
6380,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,such knowledge the visits of the minstrel may clearly be placed among
6381,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the 'things which may have happened.' What these poets certainly did
6382,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,know was that Eormenric was a prominent figure in some traditional
6383,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"stories, Guthhere in others. It did no violence to the story (μῦθος)"
6384,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,itself to bring an anonymous character into contact both with Eormenric
6385,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"and Guthhere, although doubtless no one would have done this while"
6386,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,either of the two was alive or indeed for some time after their death.
6387,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"But we must not in such cases apply the principle that, since _A_ comes"
6388,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"into contact with both _B_ and _C_, therefore _B_ may come into contact"
6389,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,with _C_--and conclude from it that poets of the seventh century
6390,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,thought it right to bring Eormenric and Guthhere together in the same
6391,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,story. That is a more advanced stage and one for which we have no
6392,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,satisfactory evidence in Anglo-Saxon poetry[222].
6393,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6394,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Now, if we turn to the Old Norse poems, which date of course from a"
6395,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"much later period, we certainly find this stage reached. Here Guðrún,"
6396,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the sister of Gunnarr (Guthhere), is represented as the mother of"
6397,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Svanhildr, the wife of Iörmunrekr (Eormenric), as well as of Hamðir"
6398,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,and Sörli who attacked that king. It is to be observed that there is
6399,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,no hint of a connection between this story and that of the Burgundian
6400,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,family except in Norse literature. Even here Guðrún is the sole
6401,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"connecting link between the two stories, and there can be little doubt"
6402,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,that the confusion is due to a mistaken identification of two different
6403,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"women. In the account of Iörmunrekr given by Saxo, who apparently"
6404,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"knows nothing of the Norse version of the story of Sigurðr, Guðrún is"
6405,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the name given not indeed to the mother of Hamðir and Sörli but to a
6406,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,sorceress consulted by them. If the wife of Sigurðr had originally the
6407,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,same name the difficulty would be capable of explanation; and it is to
6408,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,be remembered that the evidence for believing that she was originally
6409,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,called Grímhildr (Kriemhilt) is by no means of a conclusive character.
6410,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,For the identification of persons bearing the same name we may compare
6411,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the confusion which pervades Scandinavian tradition in regard to the
6412,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,various kings called Fróði[223].
6413,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6414,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,In other cases where we find two stories which seem to be wholly
6415,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"irreconcilable with one another, the difficulty can be traced to the"
6416,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,misinterpretation of an epithet. Thus the relationships and adventures
6417,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,of the Swedish kings mentioned in Beowulf differ a good deal from
6418,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,what is recorded of the same persons in Norse literature. In Beowulf
6419,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the Swedish king Ongentheow has two sons Onela and Ohthere, the"
6420,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,former of whom is married to a sister of the Danish kings Hrothgar
6421,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"and Halga[224]. Strife breaks out between Onela and his two nephews,"
6422,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Eanmund and Eadgils, the sons of Ohthere (who is perhaps dead); Eanmund"
6423,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"is slain, but Eadgils with the help of Beowulf succeeds in defeating"
6424,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,and killing his uncle and gaining for himself the throne. In Norse
6425,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"tradition Aðils (Eadgils) is the son and successor of Óttarr (Ohthere),"
6426,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,but the grandfather is called Egill and there is no mention of Eanmund.
6427,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Aðils again is married to Yrsa, who is both the wife and daughter of"
6428,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Helgi (Halga)--which is hardly compatible with the account given in
6429,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Beowulf. He engages in war with a king Áli (Onela) whom he defeats and
6430,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,kills with the help of Biarki (Beowulf) and other warriors sent to him
6431,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"by his stepson Hrólfr Kraki. But Áli is said to be a Norwegian, and"
6432,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,there is no hint of any relationship on his part to either the Swedish
6433,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,or the Danish royal family.
6434,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6435,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,In this story it seems clear that the Norse tradition has been led
6436,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,astray by a misinterpretation of the expression _hinn Upplenzki_ ('the
6437,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"man of the Uplands'), which is applied to Áli. There was a district"
6438,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"called Upplönd in Norway, but it was also the name of the Swedish"
6439,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"province in which the capital (Upsala) was situated. Since, according"
6440,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"to Beowulf, Onela was the actual king of the Swedes, there can be no"
6441,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,doubt that it was the latter to which the title originally referred.
6442,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,The erroneous identification with the Norwegian district--natural
6443,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"enough in Norse tradition--led to the idea that Áli was an invader, and"
6444,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,hence to further dislocations in the story.
6445,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6446,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,In the group of stories which cluster round Dietrich von Bern we find a
6447,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"number of unhistorical situations, which may largely be due to similar"
6448,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,mistakes rather than to deliberate invention. Thus when Dietrich
6449,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"appears at Etzel's court, as in all German authorities, including"
6450,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Thiðreks Saga af Bern, it is probable that the hero has been confused"
6451,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"with his father (Theodemir), who, as we know from Jordanes, was really"
6452,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,subject to Attila. This situation cannot be traced in Anglo-Saxon
6453,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"poetry, while in Old Norse literature (apart from Thiðreks Saga) it"
6454,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,is limited to Guðrúnarkviða III[225] and the prose introduction to
6455,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Guðrúnarkviða II, which is believed to be derived from the other poem."
6456,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,The association of Dietrich with Siegfried occurs only in Thiðreks Saga
6457,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"and some of the later German poems, which seem to invent combinations"
6458,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,quite freely[226].
6459,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6460,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"But a much larger number of authorities, including the Annals of"
6461,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Quedlinburg, bring Dietrich into connection with Ermanrich and the"
6462,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,early Gothic hero Wittich; and this combination is believed to be of
6463,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"much greater antiquity, as the names Theodric and Widia are associated"
6464,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,also in the Anglo-Saxon poem Waldhere. Here we are confronted with
6465,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,a question of great difficulty. The association of Theodric and
6466,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Eormenric is unknown to all the early Scandinavian authorities, and"
6467,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,even in Germany it cannot be traced back beyond the end of the tenth
6468,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"century; in the old Hildebrandslied Dietrich's enemy is called Otachar,"
6469,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"i.e. Odoacer. Further, apart from the passage in Waldhere, there is"
6470,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,little or no decisive evidence for a knowledge of the story of Dietrich
6471,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,von Bern in England[227]; for the statement in Deor that Theodric
6472,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,possessed the _Maeringa burg_ for thirty years may just as probably be
6473,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,applied to the exile of Wolfdietrich with Berchtung of Meran[228]. Now
6474,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Dietrich and Wolfdietrich must be confused to some extent in German
6475,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"tradition, since they are both credited with an exile of thirty years."
6476,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Perhaps this confusion goes deeper than is generally recognised. The
6477,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,true explanation may be that a considerable portion of Wolfdietrich's
6478,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,story has been transferred to his namesake. I cannot admit that the
6479,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,identification of Wolfdietrich with the Frankish king Theodberht is
6480,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,anything more than a very doubtful hypothesis; he may really have been
6481,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,an early Gothic prince[229]. Certainly the name was extremely common in
6482,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"that nation, for we meet with four Gothic kings called Theodric within"
6483,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,half a century of one another.

6487,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,So far we have been dealing with stories which have been
6488,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,distorted--apparently in quite late times--either by mistaken
6489,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,identifications or by an erroneous interpretation of some title or
6490,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,incident. The lapse of time in itself will account for some of these
6491,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"changes, especially if we bear in mind the influence of Stage III (cf."
6492,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"p. 94 ff.), through which the stories have passed both in Germany"
6493,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"and in the North. Fiction of a type however, especially the tendency"
6494,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"towards combination, is certainly not wanting. In the medieval German"
6495,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,poems indeed it is widely used and on a scale far more ambitious than
6496,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,what we have observed in Widsith. Here however we have to take into
6497,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,account the influence of romantic poetry. The nature of the use of
6498,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,fiction in the North is not so clear. If it could be proved that such
6499,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,stories as those of Oddrún and the ordeal of Guðrún originated in
6500,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the North we should certainly have to grant that it was of a fairly
6501,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,advanced type.
6502,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6503,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Now we must consider certain cases which seem to have originated in
6504,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,much earlier times. As an instance we may take the Norse story that
6505,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Atli was murdered by Guðrún. Now this story conflicts with what appear
6506,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,to be the true facts in two distinct points: (i) that Attila was
6507,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,murdered at all; (ii) that the person who was present with him when he
6508,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,died was anyone whom we can identify with Guðrún. The story that Attila
6509,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"was murdered by a woman is, as we have seen, one of great antiquity;"
6510,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,but there is nothing to show that this woman was Guðrún. It is true
6511,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,that Norse and German tradition agree in stating that Attila married a
6512,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"sister of Guthhere. This is a statement which cannot be proved, though"
6513,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,there is nothing intrinsically improbable in such a marriage. But both
6514,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,traditions represent Attila and his Burgundian wife as married for a
6515,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"number of years, and both speak of their children. Yet there can be"
6516,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,little doubt that according to the original story Attila was murdered
6517,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,by his bride (Ildico) on the night of the wedding. Hence we must surely
6518,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,trace the origin of the Norse story to a combination between two much
6519,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,earlier traditions: (1) that Attila married a sister of Guthhere;
6520,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,(2) that Attila was murdered by his wife. In view of the story of
6521,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Guthhere's death--which is common to both traditions and undoubtedly
6522,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,ancient--it required but little poetic imagination to identify the two
6523,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,women and to represent the murder as an act of vengeance. I see no
6524,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,ground for supposing that this combination took place before the Viking
6525,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Age. The other story is of course much older; but the evidence seems to
6526,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,me to point to an origin in common report rather than in poetic fiction.
6527,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6528,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"The story of Hamðir and Sörli is a somewhat different case. Here again,"
6529,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"as we have already seen, Guthhere's sister was drawn into the story"
6530,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,only in the Norse version and probably quite late. But even before this
6531,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,time it contained features which cannot be regarded as historical.
6532,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,In the Danish (Saxo's) version also Svanhildr appears as the wife of
6533,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Iörmunrekr; but there is no satisfactory evidence for this except in
6534,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the North, and it is clearly contrary to Jordanes' account. Again, the"
6535,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,North German form of the story[230] agreed with the Northern versions
6536,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,in stating that the king lost both his hands and both his feet in
6537,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the encounter. Consequently this feature may be regarded as at least
6538,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,comparatively ancient; but it seems not to be known to Jordanes. As
6539,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"in the last case, therefore, we can trace the gradual development"
6540,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"of the story more or less clearly. In its earliest known form, as"
6541,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"given by Jordanes, Svanhildr is said to have been the wife of a man"
6542,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,(apparently the prince of a dependent tribe) who deserted Eormenric
6543,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,(perhaps by joining the Huns). To punish his disloyalty the king had
6544,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,her tied to wild horses and thus torn to pieces. In an attempt to
6545,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"avenge this outrage her brothers gave him a serious wound, which was"
6546,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,partly the cause of his death[231]. In the last point Jordanes may
6547,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,have been trying to combine the tradition with another account of
6548,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Eormenric's death which he knew from historical sources. Otherwise the
6549,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,story contains nothing incredible[232]. Yet the element of fiction
6550,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,was probably present from the beginning. In the earlier stages its
6551,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,influence may be detected at least in the elaboration of the incident
6552,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"and in exaggeration of its effects, whereas in later times it shows"
6553,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,itself in the invention of relationships and in false combinations.
6554,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6555,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Next we will take the story of Beowulf's death, which has the great"
6556,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,advantage of being preserved in an early form. This story may be
6557,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,regarded in a sense as pure fiction. Strictly speaking however it
6558,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,consists of at least three distinct elements: (i) Beowulf's encounter
6559,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"with the dragon, (ii) the hero's funeral, (iii) incidental references"
6560,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"to the past history of the Geatas. The last element is in part, and"
6561,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"probably to a very large extent, founded on fact; so we will confine"
6562,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,our attention to the other two. The account of the hero's funeral is
6563,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,a good illustration of Aristotle's dictum as to the true function of
6564,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,poetry--to express the universal rather than the particular. We have
6565,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,no reason for supposing that the poet had any information regarding
6566,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Beowulf's real funeral. The description which he composed is that of
6567,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,such a funeral as might reasonably be expected for a man of Beowulf's
6568,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,rank and reputation. But the same remark is largely true also of the
6569,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,first element. Grant that the latter part of Beowulf's career was
6570,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"really unknown and that, through confusion with an earlier hero, it had"
6571,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,come to be said that he perished in an encounter with a dragon--nearly
6572,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,all the rest[233] can be attributed to the same faculty for elaboration
6573,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,which we find in the funeral scene. More imagination perhaps was
6574,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,required in this case; but it must not be supposed that our author was
6575,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the first to describe an encounter of this kind. Far more probably he
6576,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,was working upon a theme which in his time was already well worn.
6577,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6578,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,*       *       *       *       *
6579,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6580,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,We have now seen that fiction in early times shows itself especially in
6581,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the way of elaboration, or perhaps we may say in the structure of the"
6582,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,story[234]. The subject itself (the μῦθος) may be based upon fact or
6583,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,upon common report or rumour which was clearly false or even totally
6584,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"incredible, as in the last instance. But I know of no story, dealing"
6585,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"with historical characters, which can be shown to be the product of"
6586,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,deliberate and conscious invention. We have still however to consider
6587,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the most important question of all. Did the use of fiction include the
6588,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,invention of characters?
6589,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6590,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,It is not safe to assume this. We know that some of the characters are
6591,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,historical in most of the heroic stories. On the other hand it is not
6592,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,obvious that a single one of the characters mentioned in the primary
6593,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,authorities is fictitious[235]. This being so it is unreasonable to
6594,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"take the view that characters should be regarded as fictitious, unless"
6595,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"they can be proved to be historical[236]. On the contrary, until the"
6596,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,use of fictitious characters is proved there is a decided presumption
6597,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,in favour of believing any given character to be historical--unless of
6598,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,course his name or some other special circumstance gives clear ground
6599,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,for suspicion.
6600,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6601,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Wiglaf is a character known to us only in connection with the story of
6602,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Beowulf and the dragon. Consequently he may be regarded with a certain
6603,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"amount of suspicion. But in one passage it is stated that his father,"
6604,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Weoxtan, had served under the Swedish king Onela and slain Eanmund, the"
6605,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,brother of Eadgils. Now in the Kalfsvísa (cf. p. 20) we find a Vésteinn
6606,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"mentioned among those who accompanied Áli (Onela) to the 'ice,' i.e. to"
6607,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the battle on the frozen lake Vener, in which that king lost his life."
6608,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,This can hardly be a different person. But if we grant the identity
6609,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,chronological considerations render it highly improbable that he is a
6610,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,fictitious character.
6611,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6612,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,A somewhat different case is presented by another of the characters
6613,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"which figure in Beowulf, namely Unferth, the Danish king's 'spokesman.'"
6614,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"The name does not occur elsewhere in English works, and it is of an"
6615,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"unusual, though by no means unknown, type[237]. According to the"
6616,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"current explanation name and character are alike fictitious, the"
6617,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,former being framed to express the man's malevolent disposition.
6618,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"He is said (vv. 587 f., 1167 f.) to have killed his brothers, and"
6619,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,on Beowulf's arrival he soon proceeds to wrangle with him[238].
6620,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"But against this stands the fact that his father is called Ecglaf,"
6621,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"an ordinary unsymbolical name, while his quarrel with Beowulf is"
6622,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,afterwards amicably settled. It seems to me therefore that the
6623,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,hypothesis is at best uncertain. We may note that Hrothgar's other
6624,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"retainers (Wulfgar, Aeschere, Yrmenlaf) bear names which betray no"
6625,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,special significance.
6626,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6627,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"A somewhat similar interpretation, though on a more ambitious scale,"
6628,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,is applied to the story of Hamðir and Sörli[239]. The name _Sunilda_
6629,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,(for _Sōnahildi_ or _Sōnihilds_) is supposed to have been chosen for
6630,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Eormenric's victim in order to express the fact that her death was an
6631,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,'expiation' (O. High Germ. _suona_) of the offence committed by her
6632,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"husband, while Hamðir and Sörli themselves have got their names from"
6633,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"their armour (O. Norse _hamr_, A.-S. _hama_, etc.; Goth. _sarwa_,"
6634,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,A.-S. _searu_). Now an interpretation of this kind deserves careful
6635,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,consideration when it provides a reasonable and more or less simple
6636,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,explanation of the names involved; but not otherwise. In this case
6637,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"it is held, contrary to all analogies, that the name _Hamðir_ (for"
6638,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,_Hama-þius_[240]) is extended from an earlier Gothic form _Hamjis_
6639,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,(Jordanes' _Ammius_). But even then the etymology is hardly rendered
6640,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"any more probable; for _ham-_ by itself can only mean 'dress,'"
6641,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,'covering.' It is only when compounded with words meaning 'war' (as
6642,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,in A.-S. _guð-hama_) that it can be used in the sense of 'mail-coat.'
6643,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Again, _Sörli_ is regarded--and this is probably correct--as a"
6644,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"diminutive of _Sarus_, which is held to represent Goth. _sarws_, though"
6645,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,no such word is known (in any Teutonic language) except as a proper
6646,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,name. What is important to notice however is that a Gothic prince
6647,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"of this name was fighting in Italy in the year 405, i.e. little more"
6648,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"than thirty years after Eormenric's death. Lastly, we may note that"
6649,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,there appears to be no satisfactory evidence for regarding _Svan-_ (in
6650,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,_Svanhildr_) as a transformation ('Umformung') of _Sōn-_[241]. Such
6651,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,a change would be intelligible enough if the name had become known
6652,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,through a document written in Latin letters; but that is a hypothesis
6653,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"which we need not discuss. As the evidence stands, considering the"
6654,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"extremely corrupt state of the proper names given by Jordanes, it"
6655,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"is far more probable that his form has lost an _-a-_, than that the"
6656,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Northern name has been changed. The conclusion therefore to which
6657,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"we are brought is that, whether the story be fictitious or not, its"
6658,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,interpretation must be considered without regard to such etymological
6659,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,speculations as these[242].
6660,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6661,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,I am far from denying of course that the etymological interpretation is
6662,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,applicable in its proper sphere. We have a reasonably safe instance in
6663,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the name _Widsith_ (cf. p. 44), as well as in the case of characters"
6664,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,derived from folk-tale or myth. In particular we have the eponymous
6665,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,ancestors of families and even nations. But these are not characters
6666,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,invented by the poet himself. Further they are always referred to a
6667,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"more or less distant past, and their occurrence in heroic poetry is not"
6668,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,very common.
6669,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6670,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Next we will take the stories of Waldhere and Sigurðr. Here again the
6671,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"etymological interpretation is often brought forward, especially in"
6672,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,connection with the women's names; but on the whole it is of minor
6673,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"importance. Now we have seen that several of the chief characters,"
6674,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Guthhere, Hagena and Attila, are common to both these stories. There is"
6675,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,no question of course that Guthhere and Attila are historical persons;
6676,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"but for Hagena this cannot be proved. If he is fictitious, then one"
6677,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,of the two stories necessarily presupposes the other. But it is by no
6678,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,means clear to which of them we should assign the priority. There is no
6679,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,valid reason for doubting that both of them go back to the Heroic Age.
6680,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6681,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,The story of Waldhere contains no feature which can be regarded as
6682,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,intrinsically improbable if allowance be made firstly for poetic
6683,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"elaboration, and secondly for the influence of Stage III (cf. p. 94"
6684,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,ff.). To the first we may perhaps assign the account of the single
6685,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,combats; to the second probably the somewhat grotesque conclusion of
6686,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the last fight, as given by Ekkehard, and certainly the discrepancy"
6687,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,which prevails in regard to the hero's origin. Ekkehard[243] says
6688,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"that his father (Alpharius) was king of Aquitaine, while the medieval"
6689,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,German poems speak both of Spanie (Spain) and Lengers (Langres) as
6690,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,his home. Now the name _Aquitani_ cannot be taken from an old native
6691,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"poem, and the same remark is probably true of _Spanie_. Moreover, if"
6692,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,we were to suppose that the hero belonged to either of these regions
6693,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,we should have to conclude that he was a Visigoth. As a matter of fact
6694,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"this conclusion is generally accepted; but it involves, obviously"
6695,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"enough, many difficulties. Langres however is scarcely open to any"
6696,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"such objection, and it further has the advantage of proximity to"
6697,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Chalon-sur-Saône, which according to Ekkehard was the home of Hiltgund."
6698,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,These districts must have been occupied at some time by settlers from
6699,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the lower Rhine, as appears from the names _Pagus Attoariorum_ and"
6700,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"_Pagus Amauorum_, the former of which lies directly between Chalon"
6701,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,and Langres. We have no definite evidence as to when the occupation
6702,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"took place, but probably it was considerably anterior to the time of"
6703,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Clovis[244]. Small Teutonic communities of this kind were doubtless too
6704,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,insignificant to be mentioned in the scanty chronicles of that age; but
6705,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,there is nothing unlikely in the story that children belonging to their
6706,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,princely families were given as hostages to the Huns.
6707,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6708,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,The case of Sigurðr must be considered independently of the hero's
6709,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"youthful adventures, which, as we have seen, are probably to be"
6710,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,regarded as later accretions to the story. Hence it is practically
6711,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,only in connection with the Burgundian royal house that the hero is
6712,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"known[245], and as soon as we lose sight of this we drift at once into"
6713,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"fruitless speculation. The story represents Sigurðr as wealthy, brave"
6714,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,and personally attractive; but it does not credit him with achievements
6715,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,which changed the destiny of nations. Consequently he is not the
6716,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,type of person whom we could reasonably expect to find mentioned in
6717,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the chronicles of that period. Guðrún (Kriemhild) again is unknown
6718,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,to history; we do not even know that Guthhere had a sister. But we
6719,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,are certainly not justified in assuming either that such a person
6720,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,never existed or that she could not have married a prince from the
6721,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Netherlands. The same remarks, mutatis mutandis, apply to the case of"
6722,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Brynhildr, the king's wife."
6723,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6724,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,From the analysis given on p. 146 it will be seen that the original
6725,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,story appears to have contained two features which we may more or
6726,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,less safely regard as fictitious. One of course is the disguise; the
6727,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,other is the incident of the ring. In the former case the two versions
6728,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,differ--from which we may perhaps infer that this feature was not very
6729,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,clearly indicated in the original form of the story. The incident of
6730,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the ring also is introduced in quite different circumstances. But at
6731,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the same time it is really the central feature of the plot; for the
6732,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,ring is the instrument chosen to bring about the ἀναγνώρισις--the
6733,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,recognition by Brynhildr of the deception which has been played upon
6734,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,her. This is an incident such as we frequently find in modern works of
6735,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,fiction. Yet it cannot by itself be held to prove the fictitious origin
6736,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,either of the characters or of the story as a whole. It may equally
6737,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,well be regarded as a device for explaining the subsequent course of
6738,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"events, in which case we may set it down as an instance of poetic"
6739,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,elaboration.
6740,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6741,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Perhaps the objection may be raised that the sequel--Brynhildr's
6742,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,resentment against Sigurðr--necessarily presupposes the deception
6743,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,practised upon her and that this deception is in both versions of a
6744,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,supernatural character. That is doubtless true; but the explanation
6745,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,is not far to seek. Both versions of the story are really aware of a
6746,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,previous acquaintance between Sigurðr and Brynhildr. In the Völsunga
6747,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Saga[246] we hear of two distinct meetings, firstly when he awakens her"
6748,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,from the enchanted sleep (cap. 20 f.) and again when he woos her on
6749,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,his visit to Heimir (cap. 24). If Brynhildr is really to be identified
6750,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"with the sleeping valkyrie, these two accounts may be regarded as"
6751,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,variants of one original story. On the other hand the Grípisspá treats
6752,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the two events separately, like the saga, though unlike the saga it"
6753,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,does not identify Brynhildr with the valkyrie. Both forms of the story
6754,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"however agree that there had been some meeting, through which Brynhildr"
6755,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,had been led to expect marriage with Sigurðr. Now the Nibelungenlied
6756,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,says nothing of a relationship of this kind. But at the same time it
6757,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,states more than once--without any explanation--that Siegfried had
6758,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,known Brünhild and her dwelling. There is some ground therefore for
6759,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,suspecting that a portion of the story has been suppressed or lost in
6760,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the German version. If so, then the explanation of the supernatural"
6761,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"disguise becomes clear enough. It is a device, doubtless an ancient"
6762,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"device[247], for saving the hero's character. Then also we obtain a"
6763,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,much stronger motive for Brynhildr's resentment. It was a case not
6764,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,merely of deception but of faithlessness. There is nothing incredible
6765,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"in that, though in real life the ἀναγνώρισις would probably come about"
6766,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,in a different way.
6767,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6768,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"If the story is fictitious--i.e. if Sigurðr, Brynhildr, Högni, Guðrún"
6769,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,(Kriemhild) and all their doings are creations of fancy--one conclusion
6770,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"at all events must, I think, be accepted. Such a story must be the"
6771,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,product of the brain of one gifted poet; it cannot be the result of a
6772,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,fortuitous concourse of lays by different authors. The analysis shows
6773,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,that the strength of the story lies chiefly in that element which
6774,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,is common to both versions. Here we have the character-studies of
6775,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Brynhildr and Högni; for even in the Nibelungenlied, greatly defaced"
6776,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"as they are, the original outlines can still be traced. The plot too"
6777,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,conforms to the highest standard of tragic art. It has complete unity
6778,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,in itself[248]; all the characters are more or less sympathetic; and
6779,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the hero's downfall is due not to any villainy (μοχθηρία) on his
6780,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"own part, but to a great error (ἁμαρτία). Lastly, whatever view may"
6781,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,be taken as to the fate of Brynhildr--a point in which the versions
6782,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,differ--nothing could be more tragic than the grief of Guðrún
6783,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"(Kriemhild), which is common to both. For the creation of a story"
6784,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,possessing all these features--a story too which lived in different
6785,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,parts of Europe for many centuries under somewhat unfavourable
6786,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,conditions--we must surely assume not only a talented poet but also a
6787,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,poem of some considerable length.
6788,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6789,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,I do not of course regard this as a conclusive argument for believing
6790,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,that the story is based on fact. For even in that case its presentation
6791,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"would require epic form, as well as poetic talent. The decision between"
6792,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,the two interpretations rests ultimately on the question whether such a
6793,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,story is more likely to have been invented or drawn from life. It seems
6794,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,probable that some of the characters added in the Norse version are
6795,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,products of fiction. But here we have to deal with a period removed by
6796,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"many ages from the times to which the story relates, and with a people"
6797,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,who had developed the cultivation of imaginative poetry to a very
6798,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,high standard. The origin of the story however must surely date from
6799,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,a period when Guthhere and the Burgundian kingdom on the Rhine were
6800,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,still remembered. In that period we have no positive evidence for the
6801,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"composition of fiction at all, much less for fiction of this extremely"
6802,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,elaborate type. On the other hand we have in Procopius' account of
6803,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"Irmingisl and Radiger (cf. p. 97 ff.), written within six or seven"
6804,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"years of the events, practically all the materials for the composition"
6805,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,of an epic poem on a very similar subject. Indeed they can hardly be
6806,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"called merely crude materials; for certain incidents are depicted, in"
6807,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"poetic fashion, rather than related, and even the supernatural element"
6808,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,is not wanting. The evidence of this passage seems to me to tell
6809,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,decidedly in favour of the view that the story of Sigurðr is founded on
6810,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,fact[249].

6814,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,In the course of this chapter we have examined a number of heroic
6815,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,stories with a view to determining how and to what extent fiction has
6816,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,been employed in their composition. We have seen that in early times
6817,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,its influence was shown chiefly in the imaginative presentation or
6818,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"structure of stories, some of which were founded on fact, others on"
6819,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,popular report or rumour which frequently introduced elements from
6820,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"folk-tales, occasionally even from myth. All such cases however may be"
6821,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"included among the 'things that may have happened,' if we take into"
6822,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,account the spirit of the times. On the other hand for the composition
6823,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,of wholly fictitious narratives--narratives which the author himself
6824,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,knew to be fictitious--and more especially for the deliberate invention
6825,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,of characters there seems to be no conclusive evidence in the stories
6826,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,which we have considered; and I am not aware of any others for which
6827,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,a stronger case could be made out. I am not prepared of course to
6828,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,state dogmatically that such fiction was not known. The case is far
6829,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,too uncertain for such a statement as that; there is no question here
6830,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,of such gross improbabilities as those which beset the hypothesis of
6831,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,'rationalised myth.' One is certainly entitled to doubt whether all
6832,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"the characters even in early poems, such as Beowulf, are taken from"
6833,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"life. But if we grant, as I think we must, the existence of earlier"
6834,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"poems dealing with the Danish court, there is nothing incredible in the"
6835,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,supposition.
6836,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6837,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,These remarks apply of course only to poems belonging to Stage I and
6838,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Stage II. The effect of Stage III was to disintegrate the stories and
6839,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,to introduce unhistorical elements of all kinds. Hence in poems of
6840,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Stage IV we meet with numerous situations which are quite incompatible
6841,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,either with history or with the older forms of the traditions. In the
6842,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"same period we find also many fictitious characters, not only in the"
6843,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"German poems, where they may be ascribed to romantic influence, but"
6844,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,also probably in those of the North.
6845,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,
6846,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,There is one type of fiction which we have not taken into account in
6847,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,our discussion. Various scholars from time to time have put forward the
6848,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,theory that some of the chief characters of the Heroic Age are really
6849,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,well-known historical persons under fictitious names. Thus Sigurðr
6850,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,has been identified with a number of famous princes from Arminius to
6851,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,Sigebert. It cannot be said that any one of these identifications is
6852,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,of a nature to carry conviction; in no case indeed have they gained
6853,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,wide acceptance. But I cannot help thinking that an error in principle
6854,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,underlies the whole theory. It was scarcely through the greatness of
6855,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"their power, much less through the effects of their achievements on"
6856,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"after generations, that the characters of the Heroic Age acquired"
6857,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,celebrity; it was far more through the impression made upon their
6858,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"neighbours and contemporaries by their magnificence and generosity,"
6859,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,"by their personality, and perhaps above all by the adventures and"
6860,THE USE OF FICTION IN THE HEROIC POEMS.,vicissitudes of fortune which fell to their lot. This is a question to

7044,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,Greece beyond the occasional bare mention of a geographical or tribal
7045,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,name. Hence it comes about that we cannot with certainty pronounce any

7059,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"though from very ancient times, at least from the seventh century,"
7060,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,the name Homer has been associated with them. In the Alexandrian age

7066,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,its present form about the middle of the eighth century. The Odyssey is
7067,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,generally thought to be a later work. Its date is set by many as late
7068,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"as the seventh century, though it is believed to have used and probably"
7069,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"incorporated earlier poems, of the ninth or eighth century. There"
7070,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,are however still a number of scholars who both deny the composite
7071,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,authorship of the poems and also believe them to be of greater
7072,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,antiquity than the dates here given.
7073,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,
7074,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,Apart from the Iliad and Odyssey the only early heroic poem which has
7075,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"come down to us is the Shield of Heracles, a work containing 480 verses"
7076,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,and giving an account of the single combat between Heracles and Cycnos.
7077,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"It has been attributed to Hesiod by various writers, at least since the"
7078,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,Alexandrian period; indeed the Argument cites Stesichoros as authority
7079,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,for this belief. At the present time however most scholars regard it
7080,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,as the work of an unknown poet of the seventh century[250].
7081,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,
7082,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,In ancient times there were a considerable number of other early epic
7083,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"poems, of which only a few insignificant fragments now remain. Some"
7084,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"of these, the Cypria, Aithiopis, Little Iliad (Ἰλιὰς μικρά), Iliu"
7085,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"Persis and Nostoi, dealt with the same cycle of story as the Iliad"
7086,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,and Odyssey. They seem however to have been of much smaller compass
7087,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,and to have treated their subjects in a far less detailed manner. It
7088,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,is thought by many that the Cypria was composed as an introduction to
7089,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,the Iliad and the others as continuations of it--the Nostoi connecting
7090,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,on to the Odyssey. At all events they were utilised by the authors of
7091,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"the prose κύκλοι, in Alexandrian and Roman times, for the purpose of"
7092,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,presenting a connected account of the whole story[251].
7093,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,
7094,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,The authorship of these poems is attributed in late writings to a
7095,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"number of persons--Stasinos of Cyprus, Arctinos of Miletos, Lesches of"
7096,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"Lesbos and Agias of Troizen--of whom nothing definite is known, but"
7097,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,who are believed to have lived either in the eighth century or in the
7098,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,early part of the seventh. In early times however--indeed probably
7099,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,down to the fourth century--it seems to have been the general belief
7100,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"that several, possibly all, of them were by Homer. Herodotus (II 117)"
7101,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,expresses his disbelief in Homer's authorship of the Cypria; but his
7102,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,words imply that he was contesting a commonly accepted view. On the
7103,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"other hand Hellanicos[252], who was approximately contemporary with"
7104,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"Herodotus, is said to have attributed the Little Iliad (including"
7105,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,possibly the Iliu Persis) not to Lesches or Arctinos but to a certain
7106,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"Cinaithon of Lacedaemon, who is said to have lived before the middle"
7107,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"of the eighth century. Lastly we must mention the Telegoneia, a sequel"
7108,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"to the Odyssey, which is said to have been composed by Eugammon of"
7109,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"Cyrene[253], probably in the sixth century."
7110,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,
7111,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,Apart from the series of poems dealing with the siege of Troy the
7112,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"most famous of the early epics was the Thebais, which gave the story"
7113,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,of the legendary kings of Thebes. This poem was attributed to Homer by
7114,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,Callinos of Ephesus[254] who lived early in the seventh century--which
7115,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,probably implies that it was not of recent composition even then.
7116,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"It had a sequel called Epigonoi, which likewise seems to have been"
7117,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"attributed to Homer, though Herodotus (IV 32) again apparently felt"
7118,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"doubtful. In addition to these mention may be made of the Oidipodeia,"
7119,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"which also dealt with the Theban story, and of the Oichalias Halosis"
7120,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"and Phocais, which were concerned with adventures of Heracles."
7121,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,
7122,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,All the poems mentioned above were probably composed in quite early
7123,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"times, though we have practically no trustworthy data as to their age"
7124,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,or authorship. A number of other epics bore the names of persons who
7125,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"were attributed to the eighth or seventh centuries, such as Cinaithon"
7126,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"(see above), Eumelos of Corinth and Asios of Samos. These however seem"
7127,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,to have been rather of a genealogical than heroic character. Peisandros
7128,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"of Rhodes, the author of an epic on Heracles, is also referred, though"
7129,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"on rather doubtful authority, to the close of this period. But the"
7130,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,other epic poets whose names have survived seem to have belonged to
7131,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"a considerably later time. The didactic epos began, under Hesiod,"
7132,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"apparently before the end of the eighth century, while early in the"
7133,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"following century there arose new types of poetry, elegiac and iambic,"
7134,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,concerned chiefly with present topics and the personal interests of the
7135,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"poets, and seldom even referring to the Heroic Age. The last remark"
7136,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"is true also, though to a less extent, of the early lyric poetry. But"
7137,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,in the early part of the sixth century Stesichoros of Himera began to
7138,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,utilise it for presenting stories of the Heroic Age in a new form. In
7139,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"Pindar's odes too, nearly a century later, the allusions to heroic"
7140,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,stories are very frequent and often of considerable length. One ode
7141,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,indeed contains almost an epos.
7142,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,
7143,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,In the fifth century however the Heroic Age figures most prominently
7144,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,in Athenian tragedy. Of the seven extant plays of Aeschylus four or
7145,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"five[255] deal with the Heroic Age and one with contemporary history,"
7146,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,while the last is concerned exclusively with supernatural beings. Of
7147,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"the two later dramatists, Sophocles and Euripides, all the surviving"
7148,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"plays[256] take their subjects from the Heroic Age. Further, we know"
7149,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"the names of a large number of lost plays, both by these and other"
7150,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"authors, and from them it appears that the surviving pieces are fairly"
7151,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"representative, so far as choice of subjects is concerned. During the"
7152,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,same period we hear of a few epic poets whose works are now lost. Some
7153,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"of these, such as Panyasis and Antimachos, dealt with stories of the"
7154,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"Heroic Age and some, as Choirilos, with contemporary history. About"
7155,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"two centuries later heroic epic poetry was cultivated at Alexandria,"
7156,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,especially by Apollonius Rhodius.
7157,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,
7158,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,Among incidental references to the Heroic Age one of the most
7159,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"interesting occurs in Hesiod's Works and Days (vv. 156-170), where"
7160,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,an age of the heroes[257] who fell at Thebes and Troy is introduced
7161,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,between the bronze age and the iron age. Herodotus' history abounds
7162,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"with references to the Heroic Age, and even Thucydides refers to it not"
7163,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"unfrequently, though in a more critical spirit. In later times we have"
7164,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,to notice especially antiquarian writers such as Strabo and above all
7165,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,Pausanias. The last-named derived his information very largely from
7166,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,local tradition and consequently the stories which he gives may often
7167,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,be independent of the poems.

7170,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,
7171,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,We may now consider briefly the chronological aspect of the Greek
7172,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,Heroic Age. It has already been mentioned that a passage in Hesiod's
7173,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,Works and Days speaks of an age of heroes intermediate between the
7174,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"bronze and iron ages, and that it further defines these heroes as"
7175,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,those who fought at Thebes and Troy. To the latter number belong no
7176,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,doubt the various characters of the Iliad and Odyssey and the other
7177,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"poems (Cypria, etc.) which dealt with the Trojan cycle of legend,"
7178,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,while the deeds of the former must have been treated in the Thebais
7179,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,and the Epigonoi. In the surviving Attic dramas which deal with
7180,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,the Heroic Age the distribution of subjects is as follows. Sixteen
7181,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"plays (three by Aeschylus, three by Sophocles and ten by Euripides,"
7182,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,including the Cyclops and Rhesos) treat of the heroes of the Trojan
7183,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"war or their children; six plays (one by Aeschylus, three by Sophocles"
7184,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,and two by Euripides) deal with the Theban story; and six plays (one
7185,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,by Sophocles and five by Euripides) are concerned with the doings of
7186,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"Heracles, Theseus or Iason. It is to be observed that the heroes of"
7187,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,the Theban story are always represented as belonging to the generation
7188,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"immediately preceding that of the heroes of Troy, while Heracles,"
7189,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,Theseus and Iason are all loosely connected with one another and made
7190,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,roughly contemporary with the Theban heroes. The remaining three plays
7191,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"(Aeschylus' Suppliants and Euripides' Ion and Bacchai), if we are"
7192,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"justified in regarding them as heroic at all, refer to persons much"
7193,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,farther back in the genealogies.
7194,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,
7195,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,It appears then that the characters who figure most prominently in
7196,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"stories of the Heroic Age were, with few exceptions, ascribed to a"
7197,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"period covering not more than three or four generations. There are, it"
7198,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"is true, a number of stories referring to much earlier generations--in"
7199,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,addition to those treated in the three plays mentioned above--but they
7200,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,seem to have been distinctly less popular than the others. On the other
7201,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,hand there is scarcely any reference to persons later than the children
7202,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,of the heroes who fought at Troy.
7203,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,
7204,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,With the evidence at our disposal it is impossible to fix any absolute
7205,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,dates for the Heroic Age. All that we can say is that the end of that
7206,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"age appears to coincide with the movement or series of movements,"
7207,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"traditionally known as the Return of the Heracleidai, to which the"
7208,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,Dorian states in the Peloponnesos were believed to owe their origin.
7209,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"According to the story, the Return took place in the second generation"
7210,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"after the siege of Troy, and the grandsons of Agamemnon, the Achaean"
7211,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"leader at the siege, were killed or expelled by the Dorians. Certainly"
7212,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,it is to be noted that the scheme of tribal or political geography
7213,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,presented to us in the Homeric poems seems to show no trace either of
7214,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,Dorians in the Peloponnesos or of Ionic settlements in the eastern
7215,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,Aegean--another series of movements which are said to have been brought
7216,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,about by the Dorian conquest.
7217,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,
7218,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,The great majority of scholars apparently regard the story of the
7219,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"conquest as containing at least a nucleus of truth, though it refers to"
7220,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,times long anterior to what we should call the historical period. The
7221,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,ancients themselves dated the events in question back to the twelfth or
7222,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,eleventh century (B.C.). But the evidence on which their conclusions
7223,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,were based is not of a very satisfactory character and will require
7224,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,careful consideration.
7225,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,

7227,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,
7228,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,Before entering upon this question it will be convenient to notice
7229,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,briefly the scenes of the stories and the localities and peoples to
7230,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,which the various characters belong. The scene of the Iliad is laid
7231,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"in the north-west corner of Asia Minor, a short distance south of the"
7232,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,Dardanelles. But the stories introduced incidentally refer for the most
7233,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"part to places on the mainland of Greece, less frequently to localities"
7234,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,in Asia Minor or Thrace. The distribution of the principal heroes is
7235,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"as follows: Agamemnon's territories, according to the Catalogue of"
7236,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"Ships (Il. II 569 ff.), lie in the north-east of the Peloponnesos,"
7237,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,including the north-western part of what was later called Argolis
7238,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"and at least the eastern half of Achaia. Elsewhere (Il. IX 149 ff.,"
7239,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"291 ff.) he appears to have possessions in Messenia. His brother,"
7240,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"Menelaos, rules over Sparta and other places in Laconia. Nestor's"
7241,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"kingdom is on the western side of the Peloponnesos, to the south"
7242,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"of Elis. Idomeneus belongs to Crete, Achilles to southern Thessaly"
7243,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"(Phthiotis), Aias, the son of Telamon, to Salamis, his namesake to the"
7244,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"eastern Locris, Diomedes to the eastern and southern parts of Argolis"
7245,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,and Odysseus to the Ionian Isles. It must not be overlooked that most
7246,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,of these districts were of little or no political importance during the
7247,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"historical period and, further, that the territories of the kingdoms"
7248,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,appear not to have coincided as a rule with the political divisions
7249,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,which we find in later times.
7250,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,
7251,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"The scene of the Odyssey is laid chiefly in the Ionian Isles, to a much"
7252,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,smaller extent in the Peloponnesos. The wanderings of the hero himself
7253,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"appear to lie chiefly in regions to the west of Greece, though there"
7254,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,may be reminiscences of the Black Sea. Some scholars relegate them
7255,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,largely or altogether to the realm of fairyland. Incidental references
7256,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"occur to Thesprotis (Epeiros) and the Aegean, as well as to more"
7257,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,distant lands such as Egypt.
7258,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,
7259,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,Thebes was doubtless the scene of the lost Thebais and Epigonoi. The
7260,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,story of Pelops seems to have been connected chiefly with Elis and
7261,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"that of Perseus with Mycenae and Tiryns, while Minos belonged to Crete"
7262,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"and Theseus to Athens. Iason's home was in eastern Thessaly, but his"
7263,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,story is largely taken up with journeys in the Black Sea and other
7264,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,distant regions. Heracles' adventures are spread over the greater part
7265,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"of Greece and many other lands, though Boeotia and Malis are perhaps"
7266,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,the districts most prominent in his story. The scene of the Shield of
7267,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,Heracles is laid in Phthiotis.
7268,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,
7269,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,It appears then that the heroic stories are distributed over the
7270,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,greater part of the ancient Greek world. Certain districts however are
7271,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"excepted, and to these special attention should be given. In the first"
7272,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,place we have practically no reference to Greek cities in Italy or
7273,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"Sicily or to heroes belonging to them, though we do hear occasionally"
7274,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,of travellers' acquaintance with these countries. More important is
7275,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,the absence of any mention of Greek cities in Asia Minor[258] and the
7276,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"adjacent islands, except those off the coast of Caria. The legends"
7277,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,which speak of colonies led to Lesbos by Penthilos the son of Orestes
7278,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,or to Miletos and elsewhere by the sons of Codros are hardly to be
7279,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"reckoned among heroic traditions. The names indeed, at least in the"
7280,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"first case, are taken from this source, but they form the subject of"
7281,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,no connected story. Miletos is mentioned in the Trojan catalogue (Il.
7282,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"II 868), but it is said to be in the possession of the Carians. To"
7283,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"Chios there is only a geographical reference (Od. III 170 ff.), and"
7284,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,though Lesbos is mentioned more frequently its inhabitants are treated
7285,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,as enemies by the Achaeans. The only real exceptions are the southern
7286,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"islands, several of which, such as Rhodes and Cos, send contingents"
7287,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,to Agamemnon's army. Cyprus too seems to be fairly well known and its
7288,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"princes, though they take no part in the expedition, are on friendly"
7289,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,terms with the Achaeans--a fact which renders the absence of reference
7290,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,to the Ionic cities all the more striking. In Greece itself nearly
7291,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,every district has a story connected with it. Attica however is one of
7292,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,the least prominent and possesses no hero of much note except Theseus.
7293,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,
7294,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,For the tribal distinctions which figure so prominently in later Greek
7295,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,history there is extremely little evidence in stories of the Heroic
7296,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"Age. The name Αἰολέες is not mentioned in the Homeric poems, while"
7297,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"Δωριέες occurs only once, as the name of one of the five peoples of"
7298,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"Crete, and Ἰάονες once as that of a people (perhaps the Athenians)"
7299,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,associated with the Locrians and Boeotians. On the other hand the
7300,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"most frequently used of all national designations is Ἀχαιοί, a"
7301,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,name which in later times was borne only by the inhabitants of two
7302,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"comparatively unimportant districts, Phthiotis and the north coast of"
7303,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,the Peloponnesos. In the Homeric poems it appears to be a collective
7304,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,term for the inhabitants of Greece and the surrounding islands. In the
7305,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"same sense we find also Δαναοί, a name which later is used only in"
7306,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,archaistic poetry. Ἀργεῖοι and Ἕλληνες seem properly to be geographical
7307,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"terms, though the former occurs frequently (the latter only once[259],"
7308,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"in the form Πανέλληνες) as a synonym for Ἀχαιοί. Names of peoples,"
7309,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"such as Ἄβαντες, Ἐπειοί, Αἰτωλοί, are of course frequently used; but"
7310,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,they denote comparatively small sections of the nation.
7311,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,
7312,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,Though the term Ἀχαιοί is used for the inhabitants of Greece
7313,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"collectively, it may of course really be the name of a tribe or people"
7314,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,which was regarded as dominant at the time. At all events in Od. XIX
7315,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,176 we find the Achaeans mentioned as merely one of five peoples which
7316,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,inhabit Crete. As an instance of a people who were apparently never
7317,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,included among the Achaeans we may take the Pelasgoi mentioned in the
7318,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"same passage. Here however we are faced with a question of nationality,"
7319,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,for Herodotus speaks of the Pelasgoi of his own time as a barbarous
7320,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"people[260], though at the same time he holds that several Greek"
7321,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"peoples, especially the Ionians and Athenians, were sprung from them."
7322,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,No indication is given in the Homeric poems that the Pelasgoi spoke a
7323,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"foreign language; but this remark is true also of many Asiatic peoples,"
7324,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,including the Trojans.
7325,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,
7326,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,On the question of Greek nationality there is unfortunately very little
7327,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,evidence either in the Homeric poems or in other stories relating to
7328,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,the Heroic Age. We cannot even tell whether the population of the
7329,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,Greek mainland was believed to be homogeneous. Only in the case of
7330,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,Crete is detailed ethnographical information given. In a passage cited
7331,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"above we are told that this island contained five peoples, namely"
7332,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"the Achaeans, Eteocretes, Cydones, Dorians and Pelasgoi. The first"
7333,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"and fourth of these are well-known sections of the Greek nation, but"
7334,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,we have no satisfactory evidence as to the nationality of the others.
7335,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,Herodotus (I 173) says that the Lycians came originally from Crete and
7336,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,adds that the whole of the island was once possessed by barbarians.
7337,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,Interesting light on the latter statement has been thrown by the recent
7338,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"discovery of certain inscriptions at Praisos, in what is said to have"
7339,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,been the Eteocretan part of the island. These inscriptions are written
7340,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,in forms of the Greek alphabet which were current in the sixth and
7341,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"fourth centuries (B.C.) respectively, but the language is not Greek."
7342,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,Besides these numerous inscriptions dating from much earlier times
7343,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,have been found at Cnossos and elsewhere; but they have not yet been
7344,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,deciphered. All that can be said at present is that we have no reason
7345,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,for discrediting Herodotus' statement.
7346,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,
7347,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,In Greece itself we have not such clear evidence for the prevalence
7348,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,of a non-Greek language. Here we are dependent on somewhat doubtful
7349,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,inferences from place-names. Yet the majority of scholars would not
7350,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,admit that the language was indigenous. Indeed the tendency at present
7351,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,is to believe that Greece and the Aegean islands were originally
7352,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"inhabited by peoples of one stock, the existence of which can be traced"
7353,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"back in Crete for many thousands of years, and that these peoples were"
7354,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,ultimately overwhelmed and absorbed--perhaps in the course of the
7355,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,second millennium--by invaders from the north. Asia Minor is supposed
7356,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,to have had a somewhat similar history. Originally it is believed
7357,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"to have been occupied by various kindred peoples, of which the most"
7358,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,prominent were the Hittites of Cappadocia. Eventually--about 1200
7359,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,B.C. according to the most recent view[261]--there took place a great
7360,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"irruption of Thraco-Phrygian peoples from the north-west, who became"
7361,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,dominant throughout the larger part of the peninsula[262].
7362,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,
7363,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,In the Iliad the forces ranged in defence of Troy are drawn from a
7364,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"wide area, extending from the Axios (Vardar) on the west to Paphlagonia"
7365,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,on the east and Lycia on the south. The nationalities represented seem
7366,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"to be chiefly of Thraco-Phrygian stock, though a few, such as the"
7367,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"Lycians and perhaps the Carians, belong to the indigenous population."
7368,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,On the other hand there is no reason for supposing that any of the
7369,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,peoples represented in Agamemnon's army were of other than Greek
7370,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,nationality. The story may therefore be regarded as one of national
7371,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,conflict. Yet it cannot be said that this feature is ever emphasised in
7372,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"the poems themselves, although the point of view throughout is that of"
7373,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,an Achaean.
7374,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,
7375,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,For local or tribal patriotism the Homeric poems furnish us with little
7376,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,or no evidence. No Greek communities and few even of their princes are
7377,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,described otherwise than in terms of respect. We may point also to the
7378,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,old controversy regarding Homer's birthplace--a controversy which owes
7379,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,its very existence to the absence of any local patriotism in the poems.
7380,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,In this respect it will be seen that Greek heroic poetry agrees with
7381,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,Teutonic.

7384,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,
7385,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,We must now return to the consideration of the chronological problem.
7386,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"In ancient times, especially during the Alexandrian period, various"
7387,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,attempts were made to calculate the exact date of the siege of Troy. Of
7388,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"these the most generally accepted was that of Eratosthenes, which was"
7389,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,based on the length of the reigns ascribed to the kings of Sparta. This
7390,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,calculation brought the foundation of the Dorian kingdom at Sparta to
7391,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"the year 1104-3, and eighty years were added to obtain the date of the"
7392,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,fall of Troy. But it has long been pointed out that the figures given
7393,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,for the reigns of the early kings are so greatly above the average that
7394,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,they cannot be regarded with any confidence. Thus the first Olympiad
7395,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,(B.C. 776-5) was made to coincide with the tenth (or eleventh) year of
7396,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,Alcamenes and Theopompos. Alcamenes was the ninth in succession from
7397,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"Eurysthenes and Theopompos the eighth from Procles, and the number of"
7398,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,years ascribed to the previous reigns amounts on the average to over
7399,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,thirty-five years for one dynasty and over thirty-nine for the other.
7400,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,But in kingdoms for which we have reliable information extending over
7401,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,a long period of time the usual average length is apparently between
7402,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"twenty and twenty-five years[263]. Hence, if the lists of kings"
7403,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,themselves are to be trusted--and even this is very doubtful in view
7404,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,of the fact that they are almost identical with the genealogies--it is
7405,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,difficult to avoid suspecting that the total period ascribed to their
7406,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,reigns collectively is more than a century too long.
7407,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,
7408,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,More reliance is perhaps to be placed on the genealogies of the two
7409,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"royal families given by Herodotus (VII 204, VIII 131). Leonidas (r."
7410,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"488-480) and Leotychidas (r. 491-469), with whom we are on sure"
7411,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"historical ground, are represented as fifteenth in descent from"
7412,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,Eurysthenes and Procles respectively. According to all analogies
7413,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,therefore we should expect that the two latter flourished not very
7414,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,long before the middle of the tenth century. In other words the date
7415,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,given by Eratosthenes for the 'Return of the Heracleidai' would
7416,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,seem to be from a century to a century and a half too early. A very
7417,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,reasonable explanation of the difficulty has been suggested by Prof.
7418,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,Meyer who points out that several passages in Herodotus' history seem
7419,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,to imply the reckoning of a generation at forty years[264]. Among the
7420,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"figures given we find (II 145) Heracles dated about 1330. Cleomenes,"
7421,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"his descendant in the twentieth generation, was born about 530, or at"
7422,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"all events not much later. For Eurysthenes and Procles, in the fifth"
7423,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"generation from Heracles, this would give about 1130, which is not very"
7424,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,far from the date fixed by Eratosthenes.
7425,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,
7426,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,It is to be remembered in the first place that the date fixed for
7427,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"Eurysthenes and Procles is apparently that of their birth, and,"
7428,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"secondly, that Eratosthenes' scheme is probably only a modification"
7429,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"of a previously existing system, other varieties of which are quoted"
7430,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,by Prof. Meyer[265]. Indeed it would not require any great exercise
7431,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,of ingenuity to point out traces of a more or less symmetrical
7432,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,distribution of the period covered by the reigns of the early Spartan
7433,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"kings[266]. But, apart from any such speculations, we can hardly"
7434,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"doubt, in the light of Prof. Meyer's showing, that the date for"
7435,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,Eurysthenes and Procles is derived ultimately from a calculation based
7436,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,on the genealogies rather than from any contemporary written record
7437,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,or tradition. The genealogies themselves of course may represent
7438,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"tradition, so far as they are not interpolated[267], but they point,"
7439,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"as we have seen, to a much later date than that which we have been"
7440,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"discussing[268]. If we substitute 32 × 15 for 40 × 15, starting from"
7441,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"the birth of Cleomenes, we are brought to about the year 1000. That"
7442,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,must be regarded as the date really indicated by Spartan tradition for
7443,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,the birth of Eurysthenes and Procles.
7444,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,
7445,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,We may now turn for a moment to the genealogies of the other Heraclid
7446,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"families, namely those of Argos, Messenia and Corinth. The first"
7447,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"of these places Pheidon in the sixth generation, according to one"
7448,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"version, in the ninth according to another, from Temenos, the uncle"
7449,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,of Eurysthenes and Procles. Unfortunately different dates are assigned
7450,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"for Pheidon. The earliest, which is not generally accepted, places"
7451,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"his reign about the middle of the eighth century. But even this,"
7452,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"taking the longer form of the genealogy, does not carry us appreciably"
7453,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,farther back than the Agiad list. The Corinthian genealogy places the
7454,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"last king, who is said to have been killed in 747, in the thirteenth"
7455,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,generation from Heracles. This would agree with the longer form of the
7456,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,Argive genealogy; several of the names however are generally regarded
7457,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,as suspicious. The Messenian genealogy is materially shorter.
7458,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,
7459,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,Apart from these Dorian genealogies there are some notices relating
7460,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"to the ancestry of persons belonging to other parts of Greece, which"
7461,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"must not be ignored. Herodotus (II 143) states that Hecataeus, who"
7462,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"was a prominent man at the beginning of the fifth century, claimed to"
7463,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,be descended in the sixteenth (i.e. fifteenth) generation from a god.
7464,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"This probably takes us back to the Heroic Age, when divine parentage"
7465,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"is common, whereas later it appears to be almost, if not entirely,"
7466,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"unknown[269]. Again, it is believed that the genealogy of the Philaidai"
7467,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"at Athens, which actually survives, though only in a corrupt form[270],"
7468,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"placed Philaios, the son of Aias, in the twelfth generation above"
7469,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"Hippocleides, who was archon in 566. Further, according to Pausanias (I"
7470,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"11), Tharypas, king of the Molossoi, who was born soon after the middle"
7471,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"of the fifth century, claimed to be descended in the fifteenth or"
7472,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,sixteenth generation from Pyrrhos the son of Achilles. It will be seen
7473,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"that, though these genealogies do not agree exactly, the discrepancy is"
7474,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,not very great. They seem to indicate the existence of a belief that
7475,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,persons who flourished in the first half of the fifth century were
7476,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,removed by about fifteen generations from the Heroic Age.
7477,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,
7478,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,On the other hand Pindar (_Pyth._ IV 9 ff.) in an ode written in 466
7479,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"and addressed to Arcesilaos IV, king of Cyrene, places that king's"
7480,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"seventh ancestor, Battos I, in the sixteenth generation from Euphemos"
7481,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"the Argonaut, a contemporary of Heracles. This exceeds even the Agiad"
7482,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"reckoning, for Pleistarchos, the representative of that family reigning"
7483,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,"in 466, was only in the twenty-first generation from Heracles. From the"
7484,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,other non-Heraclid genealogies we should have expected that the number
7485,THE HEROIC AGE OF GREECE.,of generations to Arcesilaos would be about what is recorded for Battos
7486,I[271].,I[271].
7487,I[271].,
7488,I[271].,"Whatever may be the explanation of this case, it will be seen that"
7489,I[271].,the other non-Heraclid genealogies are shorter than that of the
7490,I[271].,"Agidai by at least three generations--if we equate Philaios, Pyrrhos"
7491,I[271].,(Neoptolemos) and the grandson of Hecataeus' god with Aristomachos
7492,I[271].,the grandfather of Eurysthenes. The dates which they indicate for the
7493,I[271].,'floruit' of these persons are in no case earlier than the middle of
7494,I[271].,the tenth century. As to the relative value of the two traditions we
7495,I[271].,"have nothing to guide us, and the same remark applies to the Greek"
7496,I[271].,genealogical evidence in general. Two points however must be insisted
7497,I[271].,"upon: (i) that the calculations of scholars of the Alexandrian age, or"
7498,I[271].,"even earlier times, are not to be interpreted as evidence of tradition;"
7499,I[271].,"(ii) that the evidence of tradition, whatever be its value, brings"
7500,I[271].,the end of the Heroic Age at least towards the close of the eleventh
7501,I[271].,century.

7504,I[271].,
7505,I[271].,"Apart from the evidence discussed above, unsatisfactory as it doubtless"
7506,I[271].,"is, chronological data for the Heroic Age itself seem to be entirely"
7507,I[271].,wanting. We know however that a highly advanced civilisation flourished
7508,I[271].,"in the Aegean in early times, and that it was succeeded by a long"
7509,I[271].,period in which both art and general culture were at a very low ebb.
7510,I[271].,"This latter period, which is commonly known as 'geometrical' from the"
7511,I[271].,"type of art which prevailed in it, lasted, so far as one can judge,"
7512,I[271].,"until about the end of the eighth century, at which time oriental"
7513,I[271].,influence began to make its appearance. The 'orientalising' period
7514,I[271].,again continued down to the beginning of the classical age. It is a
7515,I[271].,common and natural hypothesis to equate the low-watermark of culture
7516,I[271].,early in the geometrical period with the generations immediately
7517,I[271].,following the Dorian conquest of the Peloponnesos. But unfortunately
7518,I[271].,"we cannot thereby obtain any certain date for the latter, since Greece"
7519,I[271].,appears to have had little contact with the outside world during the
7520,I[271].,geometrical period.
7521,I[271].,
7522,I[271].,In recent years some advance has been made through the operations
7523,I[271].,"carried out by the British School at Sparta, which is perhaps the most"
7524,I[271].,important site for our purpose. From the stratification of the deposits
7525,I[271].,"Mr Dawkins, the director, has come to the conclusion that the earliest"
7526,I[271].,temple and altar at the sanctuary of Artemis Orthia date from the ninth
7527,I[271].,"or even the tenth century[272]. The temple, which must have been one"
7528,I[271].,"of the earliest known, appears to have been a narrow and unpretentious"
7529,I[271].,structure of crude brick and timber. Some geometrical sherds were found
7530,I[271].,"beneath the floor, a fact which shows that the sanctuary had been in"
7531,I[271].,use somewhat earlier. If the sanctuary was founded at the beginning of
7532,I[271].,the Dorian settlement at Sparta it is obvious that this result agrees
7533,I[271].,well enough with the date indicated for the conquest by tradition. No
7534,I[271].,relics of pre-geometrical times appear to have been found.
7535,I[271].,
7536,I[271].,When we turn back to the times of the earlier civilisation it is
7537,I[271].,much easier to establish chronological equations; for the presence
7538,I[271].,of Egyptian objects among Aegean remains and of Aegean objects or
7539,I[271].,representations of Aegean objects in Egypt shows that there was
7540,I[271].,frequent communication between the two areas. Thus there is little
7541,I[271].,doubt that certain Cretan remains date from periods contemporaneous
7542,I[271].,with the twelfth and Hyksos dynasties. Others again clearly belong
7543,I[271].,to the period of the eighteenth dynasty--at all events the earlier
7544,I[271].,part of it. As to the date of the destruction of the Cretan palaces
7545,I[271].,opinions still differ considerably; the most recent statement by Dr
7546,I[271].,Evans is in favour of about 1350[273]. But this catastrophe did not
7547,I[271].,bring the Aegean civilisation to an end. We find inscriptions dating
7548,I[271].,from the subsequent period (Late Minoan III) apparently quite similar
7549,I[271].,"to those discovered in the earlier stratum, and the various artistic"
7550,I[271].,"types, though decadent, show no breach of continuity. Indeed 'Mycenean'"
7551,I[271].,influence seems to have been more widespread (e.g. in Thessaly and
7552,I[271].,Italy) at this time than in any earlier period. In Egypt vases of the
7553,I[271].,same type are depicted in the wall-paintings on the tomb of Rameses
7554,I[271].,"III, who died about 1170. After this time however traces of Mycenean"
7555,I[271].,influence are rarely found in that country.
7556,I[271].,
7557,I[271].,Within the last few years it has come to be noticed that the deposits
7558,I[271].,dating from the last Mycenean period fall into two well-marked groups.
7559,I[271].,"The remarks made above, as to the art of Late Minoan III being a"
7560,I[271].,"continuation of that of the preceding period, apply properly only to"
7561,I[271].,the first of these groups--represented by the cemeteries of Zafer
7562,I[271].,"Papoura (Cnossos) and Phaistos, the late Mycenean megaron at Hagia"
7563,I[271].,Triada (also in Crete) and the late palace at Phylakopi in Melos.
7564,I[271].,"Other deposits, represented by the tombs found at Mouliana, Milatos,"
7565,I[271].,"Kavousi and Erganos (all in Crete), though they have certain features"
7566,I[271].,"in common with the former group, yet at the same time show a number of"
7567,I[271].,characteristics which are entirely new. Of these the most important are
7568,I[271].,"the practice of cremation and the use of fibulae and iron weapons, all"
7569,I[271].,of which are unknown in the Aegean before this time. From a careful
7570,I[271].,study of the pottery found in these deposits Dr D. Mackenzie[274] has
7571,I[271].,come to the conclusion that it belongs to the same period as the famous
7572,I[271].,'Warrior Vase' from Mycenae. This again is obviously contemporary with
7573,I[271].,"a painted stele, likewise representing warriors, which was found in"
7574,I[271].,one of the latest graves in the lower town at the same place. Fibulae
7575,I[271].,also were found here in the same group of graves. The importance of
7576,I[271].,these observations lies in the fact that the armature of the warriors
7577,I[271].,depicted on the vase and the stele corresponds in all essentials to
7578,I[271].,what is described in the Homeric poems. This had already been pointed
7579,I[271].,out by Prof. Ridgeway[275]; but many scholars have attributed both
7580,I[271].,objects to a much later period. Now however in view of the sequence
7581,I[271].,"which Dr Mackenzie has succeeded in tracing, in Cretan pottery and"
7582,I[271].,"other articles, from the time of the destruction of the palaces"
7583,I[271].,"onwards, it appears that the latter view can hardly be maintained."
7584,I[271].,"Lastly, Dr Mackenzie has pointed out that all the above deposits"
7585,I[271].,differ radically from those of the strict geometrical period found
7586,I[271].,in cemeteries at Cnossos and Courtes and in the 'beehive' tomb near
7587,I[271].,Kavousi (all in Crete). There are clear indications that all the latter
7588,I[271].,belong to a subsequent time.
7589,I[271].,
7590,I[271].,As a result of his investigations then Dr Mackenzie has come to the
7591,I[271].,conclusion that three well-marked periods can be distinguished in
7592,I[271].,"Cretan history, after the destruction of the palaces. But further, he"
7593,I[271].,believes that each of these periods coincides with a new settlement in
7594,I[271].,"the island--the true geometrical period with the Dorian settlement, the"
7595,I[271].,"'sub-Mycenean' with that of the Achaeans, and the last true Mycenean"
7596,I[271].,period (Late Minoan III) with a settlement of Pelasgoi. The evidence of
7597,I[271].,the deposits found at Sparta and elsewhere tends distinctly to favour
7598,I[271].,"the first of these identifications. For, though geometrical art was"
7599,I[271].,"by no means confined to the Dorians, it may be presumed that their"
7600,I[271].,settlement was the latest of those which took place in Crete. Some
7601,I[271].,"scholars hold that they came there from the Peloponnesos, while others"
7602,I[271].,place their settlement in the island prior to the invasion of the
7603,I[271].,peninsula--and ancient authority can be obtained for both views. But in
7604,I[271].,either case it is improbable that the two events were separated by a
7605,I[271].,"long interval. Again, the identification of the second or sub-Mycenean"
7606,I[271].,period with that of Achaean settlement is rendered extremely probable
7607,I[271].,by the resemblance which deposits of this period show to objects and
7608,I[271].,"customs described in the Homeric poems, e.g. in regard to armature and"
7609,I[271].,the use of fibulae and cremation. In the poems the Achaeans are clearly
7610,I[271].,"represented as dominant even in Crete, while in Greece itself, as we"
7611,I[271].,"have seen, the existence of other nationalities is practically ignored."
7612,I[271].,
7613,I[271].,In regard to the earliest of the three settlements Dr Mackenzie's
7614,I[271].,theory may be open to more serious question. The ethnical affinities
7615,I[271].,"of the Pelasgoi are still quite obscure. Again, although new types,"
7616,I[271].,"apparently derived from the mainland, do occur at this time, the break"
7617,I[271].,of continuity with the preceding age does not seem to be anything like
7618,I[271].,so marked as in the subsequent periods. It is scarcely impossible that
7619,I[271].,the destruction of the palaces may be due to naval warfare or piracy
7620,I[271].,"on a large scale, or even to commotions within the island itself. For"
7621,I[271].,our purpose however this part of Dr Mackenzie's theory is of minor
7622,I[271].,importance[276].
7623,I[271].,
7624,I[271].,In other respects at all events the theory seems to provide a very
7625,I[271].,satisfactory explanation of the phenomena. We have seen that the
7626,I[271].,"Spartan evidence, whether traditional or archaeological, affords no"
7627,I[271].,justification for dating the Dorian invasion very long before--or
7628,I[271].,after--1000 B.C. Now we find very good evidence for two distinct
7629,I[271].,periods of culture between that event and the destruction of the Cretan
7630,I[271].,"palaces, which took place probably in the fourteenth century. The"
7631,I[271].,later of these periods is the one with which we are chiefly concerned;
7632,I[271].,for Greek tradition universally places the Heroic Age in times
7633,I[271].,immediately preceding the Dorian invasion. It is therefore a fact of
7634,I[271].,great significance that the deposits of this age agree in so striking
7635,I[271].,a manner with the evidence of the Homeric poems. As to the relative
7636,I[271].,duration of the two periods (Late Minoan III and sub-Mycenean or
7637,I[271].,Achaean) archaeologists apparently have not as yet ventured to express
7638,I[271].,an opinion. But it may be observed that the poems themselves give no
7639,I[271].,indication that the Achaean dominion was believed to be of recent
7640,I[271].,"growth. The Cretan king Idomeneus is one of the oldest leaders at Troy,"
7641,I[271].,and his grandfather is said to have reigned at Cnossos before him. The
7642,I[271].,evidence of the poems then favours the idea that even in Crete Achaean
7643,I[271].,dominion lasted at least a century.
7644,I[271].,
7645,I[271].,"This brings us back nearly to times when, fortunately, historical"
7646,I[271].,"evidence is available once more, namely from the Egyptian monuments."
7647,I[271].,During the thirteenth and twelfth centuries Egypt was threatened
7648,I[271].,on several occasions by formidable armies. During the reign of
7649,I[271].,"Merenptah, probably about 1220, it was attacked by a host of Libyans"
7650,I[271].,"and ""foreign soldiers of the Libyans"" whom ""the miserable Libyan had"
7651,I[271].,"led hither[277]."" The names given to the confederates are Akaiuasha,"
7652,I[271].,"Thuirsha (Turusha), Shakalesha (Shakarusha) and Shardina. Very early"
7653,I[271].,"in the next century, during the reign of Rameses III, a fresh attack"
7654,I[271].,was made from the same quarter. A few years later Rameses encountered
7655,I[271].,"both by land and sea a great host coming from the north. ""The Isles"
7656,I[271].,"were restless, disturbed among themselves at one and the same time. No"
7657,I[271].,"land stood before them, beginning from Kheta (Cappadocia and Cilicia),"
7658,I[271].,"Kedi (the 'circling' of the Syrian coast at the Gulf of Iskanderun),"
7659,I[271].,"Carchemish, Arvad and Alashiya. They destroyed them, and assembled"
7660,I[271].,"in their camp in the midst of Amar (_Amurru_; Palestine)[278]."" The"
7661,I[271].,"invaders here are called Shardina, Pulesatha (or Purusatha), Vashasha,"
7662,I[271].,Tchakaray (Zakar) and Danaau (or Danauna)[279]. Other Shardina appear
7663,I[271].,to have been fighting on the side of the Egyptians. About a century
7664,I[271].,earlier the Hittites brought a great confederacy against Rameses II.
7665,I[271].,"Among the names given here are Luka, Pidasa, Kalakisha, Dardenui and"
7666,I[271].,Masa[280]. On this occasion also we find Shardina in the Egyptian army.
7667,I[271].,"In the Tell-el-Amarna tablets, which date from shortly before the"
7668,I[271].,"middle of the fourteenth century, we hear of Sirdana (apparently the"
7669,I[271].,"same people) serving under the Egyptians in Palestine, and of attacks"
7670,I[271].,"made upon the coast by Lukki, who are believed to be identical with the"
7671,I[271].,Luka[281].
7672,I[271].,
7673,I[271].,Unfortunately scholars have not yet been able to come to any general
7674,I[271].,agreement as to the identification of most of these names. It is
7675,I[271].,commonly held that Pulesatha and Luka denote the Philistines and
7676,I[271].,Lycians respectively. Many writers also identify the Shardina with
7677,I[271].,"the Sardinians and the Shakalesha with the Siceloi, but others"
7678,I[271].,connect these names with Sardis and Sagalassos in Asia Minor. Other
7679,I[271].,identifications which have received more or less assent are those of
7680,I[271].,"Akaiuasha, Thuirsha, Danaau, Dardenui and Masa with the Achaeans,"
7681,I[271].,"Tyrrhenians, Danaoi, Dardanoi and Mysians, and of Vashasha and Pidasa"
7682,I[271].,with the inhabitants of Oaxos (in Crete) and Pedasos (in Caria)
7683,I[271].,"respectively. It has been supposed also that the Tchakaray, who are"
7684,I[271].,"mentioned occasionally as mariners in later times, likewise belonged to"
7685,I[271].,Crete.
7686,I[271].,
7687,I[271].,In spite of the large element of doubt attaching to most of these
7688,I[271].,"identifications one important conclusion may be drawn with safety,"
7689,I[271].,namely that several of the nations mentioned had come from a
7690,I[271].,considerable distance. Even those scholars who deny the references
7691,I[271].,to Sicily and Sardinia hold that nearly all parts of the Aegean are
7692,I[271].,represented in the lists. The inscriptions frequently speak of the
7693,I[271].,invaders as coming from the sea or from islands. Thus the Pulesatha are
7694,I[271].,"said to be ""in the midst of the sea."" Again the king ""slaughtered the"
7695,I[271].,"Danauna in their isles[282]."" We find also the expressions ""Vashasha"
7696,I[271].,"of the sea,"" ""Shardina of the sea,"" ""Thuirsha of the sea[283]."" Such"
7697,I[271].,terms are said to be often used loosely; but under the eighteenth
7698,I[271].,and nineteenth dynasties the territories of the Hittite kingdom in
7699,I[271].,Syria and Cappadocia had become so well known to the Egyptians that
7700,I[271].,it is incredible that any of the peoples of that region can be meant.
7701,I[271].,"The appearance too and the armature of the Shardina, as portrayed"
7702,I[271].,"on the monuments, are quite incompatible with the supposition that"
7703,I[271].,they belonged to any of the countries round the south-east of the
7704,I[271].,Mediterranean.
7705,I[271].,
7706,I[271].,We have seen that the northern invasion repelled by Rameses III was
7707,I[271].,"preceded by 'disturbances in the isles,' while the lands of the"
7708,I[271].,Hittites and their neighbours had apparently been overrun by the
7709,I[271].,invaders before the attack upon Egypt. Now it has been noted that the
7710,I[271].,great Hittite kingdom (in Cappadocia) appears to have been destroyed
7711,I[271].,about the same time. In explanation of this the theory has recently
7712,I[271].,been put forward[284] that the invasion repelled by Rameses III was
7713,I[271].,closely connected with that irruption of Thraco-Phrygian peoples into
7714,I[271].,Asia Minor to which we have already referred (p. 178). It will be seen
7715,I[271].,that this theory has an important bearing on the Homeric question;
7716,I[271].,for in the Iliad we find the Thraco-Phrygian peoples already fully
7717,I[271].,"established in Asia Minor, and no hint is given that their settlement"
7718,I[271].,there was believed to be in any sense recent.
7719,I[271].,
7720,I[271].,But it is by no means impossible that the 'disturbances in the isles'
7721,I[271].,may refer to a displacement of population in a different quarter--which
7722,I[271].,may or may not be connected with the Phrygian settlement in Asia Minor.
7723,I[271].,"The movement against Egypt was, in part at least, a maritime one, and"
7724,I[271].,when Rameses is said to have slaughtered the invaders in their islands
7725,I[271].,"the reference can hardly be to the old Hittite kingdom, which had long"
7726,I[271].,been known to the Egyptians. Surely it is more natural to connect the
7727,I[271].,'disturbances' with those national movements in the southern Aegean
7728,I[271].,which eventually brought the Mycenean civilisation to an end. We have
7729,I[271].,seen that the last period of this civilisation is believed to have
7730,I[271].,begun in the fourteenth century and to have lasted some considerable
7731,I[271].,time. The convulsions of Rameses' time (the early years of the twelfth
7732,I[271].,century) may therefore mark a stage in the movements which brought
7733,I[271].,about its destruction.
7734,I[271].,
7735,I[271].,In any case it is from the Egyptian monuments of this period that we
7736,I[271].,obtain the clearest evidence for contact between the true Mycenean
7737,I[271].,civilisation and that 'sub-Mycenean' or 'Achaean' type which followed
7738,I[271].,it. The warriors of the invading forces[285] are represented as armed
7739,I[271].,with swords of the regular Mycenean pattern or with spears of no
7740,I[271].,very great length. Some of them--the Pulesatha and Tchakaray--wear a
7741,I[271].,"peculiar head-dress, apparently made of feathers[286], which recalls"
7742,I[271].,the type used in later times by the Lycians according to Herodotus (VII
7743,I[271].,92). On the other hand the Shardina are depicted with very elaborate
7744,I[271].,"helmets[287], which, except that they have no plumes, are almost"
7745,I[271].,identical with those borne by the figures on the Warrior Vase (cf. p.
7746,I[271].,"185). The Shardina and many of the Pulesatha also carry round shields,"
7747,I[271].,"held in one hand, as in the case of the warriors represented on the"
7748,I[271].,"Vase[288] and the Stele. This fact is especially noteworthy, since"
7749,I[271].,the round shield seems to have been totally foreign not only to the
7750,I[271].,"Egyptians themselves, but also to the Hittites and all neighbouring"
7751,I[271].,"peoples[289], while even in the Aegean area it was apparently not used"
7752,I[271].,in centres of Mycenean civilisation[290]. On the other hand both these
7753,I[271].,features correspond to the type of armature described in the Homeric
7754,I[271].,poems. It would not be correct of course to say that the portraits of
7755,I[271].,the Shardina might be taken as faithful representations of Homeric
7756,I[271].,"warriors. We find no trace of greaves, while the body-armour is of"
7757,I[271].,a less elaborate type than that described in the poems[291]. The
7758,I[271].,Homeric type of armature--represented by the Warrior Vase as well as
7759,I[271].,in the poems--belongs clearly to a later stage of development than
7760,I[271].,"the Shardina type, and therefore probably to a later age than the"
7761,I[271].,early part of the twelfth century. Yet there is sufficient resemblance
7762,I[271].,between the two to render it more than likely that the one is descended
7763,I[271].,from the other.
7764,I[271].,
7765,I[271].,Whatever may have been the causes which brought about the movement
7766,I[271].,"encountered by Rameses III, some of the other references point"
7767,I[271].,"distinctly to bands of mercenary soldiers, rather than to national"
7768,I[271].,"migrations. This is especially clear in the case of the Shardina,"
7769,I[271].,who are mentioned for the first time as serving under the Egyptians
7770,I[271].,in Palestine. But the earliest reference--in the Tell-el-Amarna
7771,I[271].,"letters--carries us back to the destruction of the Cretan palaces, if"
7772,I[271].,Dr Evans' date for this catastrophe is correct. It has been remarked
7773,I[271].,"that, in striking contrast with Mycenae and other early centres of"
7774,I[271].,"civilisation in Greece, the Cretan palaces were almost entirely"
7775,I[271].,unfortified; and the explanation commonly given of this fact is that
7776,I[271].,their owners ruled the seas. If this is true we must conclude that the
7777,I[271].,earliest maritime expeditions of the Shardina and their confederates
7778,I[271].,did not take place without their consent.
7779,I[271].,

7781,I[271].,
7782,I[271].,"In the course of this discussion we have seen that, though historical"
7783,I[271].,"evidence for the Greek Heroic Age is entirely wanting, later tradition"
7784,I[271].,points to the eleventh century as the time to which the poems and
7785,I[271].,"legends refer; and further, that, unsatisfactory as it doubtless is,"
7786,I[271].,this evidence is corroborated to a considerable extent by the results
7787,I[271].,of archaeological investigation. In much earlier times various parts
7788,I[271].,"of the Greek world possessed a high civilisation, which has left"
7789,I[271].,remains of magnificent palaces and many elaborate works of art. The
7790,I[271].,evidence of these remains does not correspond at all to the state of
7791,I[271].,society revealed in the poems. But at the close of this earlier period
7792,I[271].,"many new objects--belonging, it would seem, to a new population--make"
7793,I[271].,their appearance; and these latter do fulfil the conditions required.
7794,I[271].,"Lastly, it is of interest to note that from the fourteenth to the"
7795,I[271].,twelfth century Egypt and the Levant were frequently visited by bands
7796,I[271].,"of soldiers, who seem to have come from the Aegean or neighbouring"
7797,I[271].,regions and who outwardly bear a somewhat striking resemblance to the
7798,I[271].,warriors described in the poems. It would appear that at this time the
7799,I[271].,East must have been more familiar to the Greek world than Greek records
7800,I[271].,would lead us to expect. This is the more noteworthy since during the
7801,I[271].,following centuries the Greeks seem to have had but little contact with
7802,I[271].,foreign nations.

8038,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8039,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8040,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"It has been mentioned that, according to the theory now most commonly"
8041,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"accepted, the Homeric poems were not the work of one author or even"
8042,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of one generation--that on the contrary they grew up gradually in the
8043,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"course of several hundred years, reaching their final form (in the case"
8044,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of the Odyssey) perhaps not before the middle of the seventh century.
8045,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,We must now review briefly the evidence on which this theory is based.
8046,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8047,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,The earliest historical references to the poems reach back only to
8048,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the beginning of the sixth century, and even these are not altogether"
8049,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"satisfactory. Cleisthenes, tyrant of Sicyon, according to Herodotus (V"
8050,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"67) prohibited rhapsodists from reciting the Homeric poems, because"
8051,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,they were full of the praises of Argos and its people. But the
8052,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,reference here is perhaps rather to the Thebais or Epigonoi than the
8053,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Iliad. Again, it is said that when Athens and Megara were disputing"
8054,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"about the possession of Salamis, both parties appealed to the authority"
8055,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of Homer in support of their contentions. If this story may be trusted
8056,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,it is of importance as showing that the poems were generally venerated
8057,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"at such an early date. And though all the evidence is late[292], the"
8058,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,form in which the passage in question (Il. II 557 f.) has survived does
8059,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,clearly suggest Athenian influence.
8060,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8061,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,References in the works of other poets carry us back to a considerably
8062,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,earlier period. It has already been mentioned that Callinos is said
8063,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"to have attributed the Thebais to Homer, from which we may infer"
8064,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"that poems under this name were already known. Archilochos, who"
8065,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"likewise flourished before the middle of the seventh century, seems"
8066,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to have attributed the Margites to Homer[293]. The extant fragments
8067,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of his works also contain several passages which apparently show
8068,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Homeric influence[294]. Terpandros, probably an older contemporary"
8069,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"of Archilochos, is said to have invented a musical accompaniment"
8070,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,for the Homeric poems[295]. In Hesiodic poetry we find a number of
8071,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,references to heroic subjects. The Catalogue appears to have dealt with
8072,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"certain adventures of Odysseus, which were probably derived from the"
8073,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Odyssey[296].
8074,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8075,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"This evidence, vague and somewhat uncertain as it is, renders it"
8076,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,probable that Homeric poetry was in existence before the seventh
8077,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,century. Further than this we cannot hope for any direct external
8078,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"evidence, for the authors cited are the earliest of whom we know"
8079,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,anything worth mention. Indeed the age of the various Hesiodic poems
8080,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,themselves is very problematical. It is customary now to attribute the
8081,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Theogony and the Works and Days to the close of the eighth century and
8082,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the other poems to the seventh. But Herodotus (II 53) referred Hesiod,"
8083,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"as well as Homer, to a period about 400 years before his own time, i.e."
8084,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to about the middle of the ninth century.
8085,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8086,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Turning now to the internal evidence, we may at all events regard one"
8087,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"fact as established, namely that the subject-matter was determined at a"
8088,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,period considerably anterior to those of which we have been speaking.
8089,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,It is not merely that the persons mentioned are uniformly referred to
8090,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the Heroic Age, for we have yet to discuss the possibility that all the"
8091,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,characters of this age are fictitious. But we have also to take into
8092,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,account the ethnographical indications contained in the poems. There
8093,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"is no hint of the presence of Dorians in the Peloponnesos, nor of the"
8094,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,existence of Ionic states in Asia Minor or even in the Cyclades[297];
8095,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,indeed the scheme of tribal or political geography which they present
8096,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,is far removed from anything we find even in the earliest records of
8097,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the historical period. We shall see later that the same remark holds
8098,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"good with regard to the system of government depicted in the poems,"
8099,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"e.g. in the universal prevalence of kingship, and so also with their"
8100,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"indications as to social organisation, religion and even ethical"
8101,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,standards. Then there is the fact that in references to weapons bronze
8102,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,is far more frequently mentioned than iron; yet it is generally agreed
8103,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"that iron must have been in common use by the tenth century, while"
8104,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,some scholars would refer its introduction to a much earlier date.
8105,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Lastly, we may take note of certain passages and expressions which"
8106,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,seem to contain reminiscences of the prehistoric civilisation of the
8107,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Aegean--a civilisation which, as we have seen, had passed its zenith"
8108,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in the fourteenth century and which was probably altogether submerged
8109,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in the convulsions which accompanied the Dorian and Ionic migrations.
8110,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Among such reminiscences we may probably count the descriptions of the
8111,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,palaces of Menelaos and Alcinoos and the use of such terms as κύανος.
8112,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Of course it is not to be supposed that any part of the poems goes
8113,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,back to the period of the early civilisation. Yet the features noted
8114,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,above seem to me to point quite clearly to a time when some of the
8115,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,ancient palaces were still known and perhaps still inhabited. Hence it
8116,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,is not merely the case that the poems are concerned exclusively with
8117,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,characters of the Heroic Age. We are bound to conclude further that the
8118,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,environment in which these characters are placed is in general such as
8119,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,belonged to the same period. This of course involves the existence of
8120,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"a verbal tradition practically from the Heroic Age itself. Indeed, we"
8121,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"may say that it probably involves a poetic tradition, for we have no"
8122,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"evidence for the existence of traditional prose narratives, whereas"
8123,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,references to the cultivation of poetry in early times are fairly
8124,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,numerous.
8125,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8126,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Now it is generally agreed that the Heroic Age--or perhaps we should
8127,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,say the type of civilisation and the ethnographical conditions with
8128,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,which this age is associated--cannot have lasted much beyond the close
8129,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of the eleventh century. Hence the date accepted by many scholars for
8130,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the completion of the Odyssey (cf. p. 169) involves a period of more
8131,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"than three centuries, during which the Homeric poems were in process"
8132,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of formation. That is a long period for continued composition in one
8133,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"subject, and it will be well now to review briefly the evidence on"
8134,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,which this theory rests.
8135,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8136,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Kirchhoff[298] dated the 'later redaction' of the Odyssey between Ol.
8137,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"30 and Ol. 50, or at all events not much before Ol. 30 (B.C. 656). To"
8138,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,this conclusion he was led primarily by the reference to the voyage of
8139,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the Argo in XII 59-72. It is probable enough that this passage implies
8140,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,acquaintance with a poem dealing with Iason's adventures; but the same
8141,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"can hardly be said of Kirchhoff's further suggestion, viz. that this"
8142,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,lost poem must have been composed some considerable time after the
8143,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,colonisation of Cyzicos[299]. The accounts which we have of the travels
8144,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,and adventures of the Argonauts can scarcely be said to indicate
8145,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that the earliest poems on this subject were composed at a time when
8146,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the Black Sea was already familiar to the Greeks; on the other hand
8147,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,travellers from time to time may have penetrated into that region
8148,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,centuries before the foundation of Cyzicos[300].
8149,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8150,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Others have sought to show that the later parts of the poem betray an
8151,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"intimate acquaintance with the western seas, such as would be possible"
8152,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,only after the development of Corinthian maritime enterprise about the
8153,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"close of the eighth century, whereas the knowledge of the same regions"
8154,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,shown by the earlier parts is of the vaguest description[301]. Here the
8155,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,evidence is derived chiefly from the references to Sicily (Σικανίη)
8156,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"and the Siceloi, Alybas (traditionally placed in the Gulf of Otranto,"
8157,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"but perhaps rather a coined name) and Temesa, which is identified with"
8158,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Tempsa in Calabria. This theory seems to me to be open to much the same
8159,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,objections as the other. It is clear now that in prehistoric times the
8160,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,south of Italy was intimately connected with the eastern coast of the
8161,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Adriatic, and we have no ground for denying that the former may have"
8162,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,been known to Greek traders or pirates long before the date of the
8163,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,earliest colonies.
8164,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8165,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"A third argument, and one which has exercised a much wider influence,"
8166,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,is based on the relationship of certain portions of the poems to the
8167,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"lost Cyclic poems (Cypria, etc.). It is held for instance that the"
8168,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Catalogues in Il. II, at all events the Trojan catalogue, were taken"
8169,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"from the Cypria, and again that in the Nekyia (Od. XI) and elsewhere"
8170,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"use has been made of the Little Iliad and the Nostoi, as well as"
8171,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the Cypria. But, granting the correctness of these hypotheses, no"
8172,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,conclusions as to date can be drawn from them unless the dates of the
8173,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,lost poems themselves are established. We have seen however that such
8174,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,is not really the case; it is admitted that the attribution of these
8175,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"poems to Arctinos, Lesches and others does not occur until very late"
8176,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,times. All that can be said is that they appear to have contained
8177,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"certain 'post-Homeric' features, such as purification for manslaughter"
8178,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,(in the Aithiopis). With these we shall have to deal later. There is no
8179,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,need however to suppose that the lost poems were any more homogeneous
8180,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,than the Iliad and Odyssey.
8181,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8182,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Again it is thought that certain passages betray the influence of
8183,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Hesiodic poetry, while others indicate genealogies or relationships"
8184,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,which are at variance with statements contained in the latter[302].
8185,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Among the former we may note especially the list of women in the Nekyia
8186,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"(Od. XI 235-327[303]), which is compared with the Hesiodic Catalogue"
8187,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of heroines. This evidence would be useful for chronological purposes
8188,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"if we knew (i) when Hesiod lived, (ii) that he was the first to"
8189,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,compose catalogues of this kind. But unfortunately neither of these
8190,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,propositions can be admitted. To the first we have already referred.
8191,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,The majority of scholars hold that Hesiod cannot have lived much after
8192,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the end of the eighth century. But there is nothing to show that he did
8193,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,not live before that time; for no sound argument can be founded on the
8194,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,last verses of the Theogony. As for the Catalogue it belongs to a class
8195,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of poetry of which the beginnings may go back to a remote antiquity.
8196,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,The presumption is that it originated in times when descent was still
8197,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,traced through the mother.
8198,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8199,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,On internal grounds many arguments have been brought forward for the
8200,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,purpose of showing that the poems in their present form have undergone
8201,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,a long process of development. With discrepancies in the narrative
8202,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,itself we need not concern ourselves. They are doubtless of importance
8203,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"for determining the question of single or composite authorship,"
8204,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,but they do not necessarily point to authorship of quite different
8205,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"ages. For instance, one poet may have conceived of the Achaean camp"
8206,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"as fortified, another as without fortifications. But that does not"
8207,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"prove that the two poets were not contemporary, for it will not be"
8208,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,disputed that the people of the Heroic Age were capable of building
8209,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"fortifications. Again, it may be that the original poem on the 'Wrath"
8210,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"of Achilles' did not originally contain Books II-VII. But, apart from"
8211,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"one or two details which we shall discuss presently, there is nothing"
8212,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to suggest that these books are the product of an entirely different
8213,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,period.
8214,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8215,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"We may even take what is perhaps the most extreme case, that of the"
8216,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Doloneia. This book is joined on very loosely to what precedes, and its"
8217,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,contents are practically disregarded in the rest of the Iliad[304].
8218,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Some critics even in ancient times seem to have believed that it did
8219,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,not originally belong to the poem. Moreover it contains a number of
8220,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,features peculiar to itself and several expressions which are regarded
8221,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,as indications of lateness. In particular there are some striking
8222,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"parallels to the passages in the Odyssey, and it is held that in"
8223,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,certain cases they are due to direct influence from the latter[305].
8224,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"But, granting all this, we are still not in a position to decide"
8225,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,whether the chronological difference between the Doloneia and the
8226,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,earlier parts of the Iliad is to be reckoned at three centuries or two
8227,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,or one[306].
8228,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8229,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,As no definite results can be attained from such considerations as
8230,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,these we will now confine our attention to arguments which are founded
8231,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,upon real or supposed differences of culture. The most important class
8232,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of evidence for our purpose is that which relates to the use of the
8233,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,metals. Both bronze and iron are frequently mentioned and there can
8234,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,be no doubt that both were well known. But it has been observed that
8235,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"weapons are nearly always said to be of bronze (χαλκός, χάλκεον ἔγχος,"
8236,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"etc.[307]), whereas iron is usually mentioned either as a substance"
8237,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"or in reference to tools, especially hatchets[308]. Only in seven"
8238,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"verses do we hear of iron weapons, even if we include in this category"
8239,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the knives mentioned in Il. XVIII 34 and XXIII 30. Two verses (_ib._
8240,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"VII 141, 143 f.) speak of an iron club and one (_ib._ IV 123) of an"
8241,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"arrowhead, while the other two (Od. XVI 294, XIX 13) refer to the arms"
8242,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in Odysseus' house collectively.
8243,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8244,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,The obvious inference from the statistics is that iron tools came into
8245,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"use before iron weapons, and though this was long thought incredible it"
8246,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,has recently been shown that there is some evidence for the prevalence
8247,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of such conditions in Palestine[309]. Moreover a somewhat striking
8248,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,confirmation of the Homeric evidence was furnished by the excavations
8249,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"at Troy, where a small lump of unwrought iron was found among deposits"
8250,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"belonging apparently to the fifth stratum[310]. It has been compared,"
8251,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"and doubtless rightly, with the lump mentioned in Il. XXIII 826 ff.,"
8252,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"though the latter must have been much larger. The presumption is that,"
8253,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"like this, it was intended for some tool or agricultural implement;"
8254,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,for all the weapons found at Troy--few as they were unfortunately--up
8255,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to the seventh stratum were of bronze. It is probable therefore that
8256,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the use of the metals not only in the fifth stratum but also in the
8257,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,sixth--the great Mycenean fortress--was similar to that which is
8258,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,indicated in the Homeric poems.
8259,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8260,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,For those who believe that these poems are the work of a single author
8261,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the words ""Iron does of itself attract a man[311]"" (Od. XVI 294, XIX"
8262,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,13) present a serious difficulty. I cannot believe in view of the
8263,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,evidence given above that iron weapons were regularly employed in the
8264,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Heroic Age[312] and that the use of the word χαλκός is a piece of
8265,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,traditional poetic archaism. Otherwise however there is no alternative
8266,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,but to regard the Odyssey verse as an interpolation[313]. But in
8267,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,reality it is no great step from iron knives and arrow-heads to the use
8268,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of the same metal for spears or even swords. If we were to adopt the
8269,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,view that the age of the composition of the Homeric poems coincides
8270,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,with the period of transition between the first use of iron for cutting
8271,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,and piercing instruments to its general employment for weapons of all
8272,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"kinds, we should not necessarily require much more than a century for"
8273,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,their development. Indeed the presence of iron swords in graves of the
8274,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,sub-Mycenean period in Crete (cf. p. 185) would seem to show that the
8275,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,transition had begun within what may be regarded practically as the
8276,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Heroic Age itself.
8277,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8278,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Again, it is held that many anachronisms or chronological"
8279,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,inconsistencies appear in the battle scenes of the Iliad. Sometimes
8280,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,we find descriptions of armour and tactics which are thought to be
8281,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,copied from those of Ionic hoplites in early historical times and to
8282,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,be irreconcilable with the type of warfare depicted in other passages.
8283,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Many of the chief men are represented as armed with breast-plates,"
8284,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"for which, it is said, there is no evidence in the Mycenean"
8285,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,age[314]--though this statement is more than doubtful[315]. In regard
8286,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to the form of the shield also there is a discrepancy. Sometimes it
8287,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"is described as being of great length, 'like a tower' or 'reaching to"
8288,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the feet'--terms which would suit the long shields often depicted on
8289,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,objects of the Mycenean age. Sometimes on the other hand we hear of
8290,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"'round' shields, which suggest the comparatively small circular shield"
8291,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of the historical period.
8292,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8293,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,These inconsistencies only concern us in so far as they are supposed
8294,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to point to widely different ages. Unfortunately our information
8295,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,regarding the geometrical period is still very defective and we do not
8296,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,know how far its characteristics were the same in all parts of Greece.
8297,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,The same remarks apply with still greater force to the preceding or
8298,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"sub-Mycenean age. Hence, though it may be true that the round shield"
8299,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,does not make its appearance in Attica till the close of the eighth
8300,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"century, we cannot argue from this that it was unknown in other parts"
8301,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of Greece[316]. In the more northern parts of Europe it appears to
8302,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,be the earliest form of shield which has been found. More important
8303,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,however is the fact that the Shardina and their confederates used the
8304,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"round shield as far back as the thirteenth century, while the shields"
8305,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,represented on the Warrior Vase and the Stele from Mycenae (cf. p. 185)
8306,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,can hardly be regarded otherwise than as a variety of the same type.
8307,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Hence, whatever may be the connection between the disappearance of"
8308,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the long shield and the growing use of body armour, there is not the"
8309,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,slightest justification for supposing that the round variety was not
8310,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,used in the Heroic Age itself.
8311,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8312,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"The commonest type of Mycenean shield, the oval type contracted in the"
8313,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"middle, belongs to a class of shields which occur in various parts of"
8314,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the world. It is probably akin to the Zulu shield, though in this the"
8315,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,lateral contraction has lost its meaning and almost disappeared. The
8316,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,primary purpose of the whole class appears to be for defence against
8317,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"missile weapons (ἕρκος ἀκόντων), whether light javelins or arrows."
8318,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,But the special characteristic of the Mycenean variety is the use of
8319,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,a suspending strap (τελαμών[317]) in place of a handle. The object
8320,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of this was to leave both hands free for the use of a long spear in
8321,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,fighting at close quarters--as we see in the representation of a
8322,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,lion-hunt engraved on a dagger-blade found at Mycenae. But it is to
8323,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,be observed that the method of fighting most commonly employed by
8324,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Homeric warriors is of quite a different character. First the spear
8325,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,was hurled--apparently with one hand (cf. Il. XXII 320)--and then an
8326,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,attack was made with the sword. For both these movements the Mycenean
8327,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"shield was obviously ill adapted. Indeed for the second, which required"
8328,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"agility above everything, it would be more of an encumbrance than a"
8329,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,protection. But even when the spear was used for thrusting there is
8330,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,nothing to show that it was usually held in both hands[318]. Hence we
8331,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,can hardly avoid concluding that the Homeric tactics were due to the
8332,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"use of a different type of armature, which included a comparatively"
8333,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,small and mobile shield. We need not suppose of course that the
8334,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Mycenean shield was unknown or even uncommon. It seems fairly clear
8335,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"that Aias the son of Telamon uses one of this type[319], and so also"
8336,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Periphetes the Mycenean whose shield reached to his feet and caused
8337,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,him to stumble (Il. XV 645 ff.)[320].
8338,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8339,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,A further suggestion is that the Homeric use of the chariot was due to
8340,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the long shield[321]. The argument in this case is that such shields
8341,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"could not be carried on horseback, while their weight was too great to"
8342,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,allow them to be borne for any distance on foot. This is an extremely
8343,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,dubious theory for two reasons. In the first place the Homeric use
8344,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of the chariot is a problem which concerns not Greece alone but a
8345,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"considerable part of Europe, including countries where there is no"
8346,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"evidence for the Mycenean shield[322]. Secondly, it may be regarded as"
8347,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,a general rule that those peoples which use the long shield not only
8348,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,fight but also go to battle on foot. Moreover the evidence of the poems
8349,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,themselves does not really bear out the suggested connection. Thus
8350,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,there is no instance of the long shield more clear than that belonging
8351,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"to Aias the son of Telamon, and this hero is one of the few leading men"
8352,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,who are never said to wear breast-plates. But he is also apparently one
8353,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of the very few who do not possess chariots. Indeed a better case could
8354,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,probably be made out for connecting the chariot with the breast-plate.
8355,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8356,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,The Homeric use of the chariot gives rise to another question which
8357,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,probably deserves more careful consideration. In the action itself
8358,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,driving appears to be universal; at most we have only one doubtful
8359,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,case of riding (Il. X 513). But there are at least two incidental
8360,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"references (Il. XV 679 ff., Od. V 371) which betray acquaintance with"
8361,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the latter art. It is quite possible therefore that the knowledge
8362,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of riding was a comparatively recent accomplishment which the poet
8363,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,or poets knew to have been foreign to the Heroic Age. Unfortunately
8364,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the history of equitation is a very obscure subject. In more eastern
8365,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,countries the use of chariots--which here were war-chariots in the true
8366,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,sense--continued until quite late times. In Cyprus we hear of them at
8367,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the beginning of the fifth century; and in Italy they were introduced,"
8368,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"or re-introduced, still later. But we do not know when riding began."
8369,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,In the wall-sculptures at Karnak[323] which commemorate the victories
8370,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of Sety I and date from towards the close of the fourteenth century
8371,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"several Hittites are shown on horseback. The scene represents a battle,"
8372,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,and it may have been the artist's intention to depict what was not a
8373,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,normal custom but the last resource of fugitives whose chariots had
8374,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,broken down. But even then the possibility remains that in emergencies
8375,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,or under special conditions riding may have been practised by the
8376,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Greeks long before it was in regular use. The whole subject however
8377,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"requires further investigation, in particular the question whether"
8378,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,there is reason for supposing the Hittites to have been more skilled in
8379,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,horsemanship than other nations.
8380,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8381,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Another series of inconsistencies has been pointed out in references to
8382,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"marriage customs, particularly in regard to the use of the word ἔεδνα"
8383,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,(ἕδνα). In several passages this word evidently denotes the sum paid
8384,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,by the bridegroom to the bride's guardian; but in others it seems to
8385,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,mean presents given to the bride at marriage by her own relatives. We
8386,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,can scarcely doubt that a difference of custom is involved in these
8387,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,usages; but it does not necessarily follow that the second group
8388,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of passages belong to a later period than the first. Account must
8389,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"be taken of local divergencies, for there is hardly any subject in"
8390,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"which early Teutonic custom varied so much as in this, even from the"
8391,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"time of our oldest records. Again, it has been suggested[324] with"
8392,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,considerable probability that the inconsistencies of the Odyssey are to
8393,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,be attributed to a change of custom--not in the sense that the earlier
8394,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"parts of the poem reflect one form and the later parts another, but"
8395,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that the poem as a whole belongs to an age of transition when different
8396,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,forms of matrimonial arrangements were in vogue. This is a question
8397,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,with which we shall have to deal more fully in a later chapter.
8398,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8399,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,We have yet to consider certain inconsistencies in regard to religious
8400,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,observances. Once only (Il. VI 303) is mention made of the figure--a
8401,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"seated figure--of a deity, and consequently it is held that the passage"
8402,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in question must be late. Recent discoveries however have tended to
8403,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"throw doubt on this view; for a number of statuettes, apparently"
8404,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"representing deities, have come to light in deposits belonging both to"
8405,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the Mycenean and Geometrical periods, while primitive female figures,"
8406,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"often in a sitting position, are quite common. The finding of a larger"
8407,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"image would now scarcely call forth much surprise, though it cannot be"
8408,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,supposed that such statues were of frequent occurrence.
8409,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8410,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"In references to sanctuaries we sometimes hear of temples (νηοί), but"
8411,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,more frequently only of shrines or sacred groves. The most certain
8412,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,examples[325] of the former are those of Apollo and Athene at Troy
8413,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"(Il. V 446, VI 88, VII 83, etc.) and another of Athene at Athens (Il."
8414,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"II 549, Od. VII 81). The sanctuary of Apollo at Chryse is also once"
8415,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"described as a temple (Il. I 39), though the account of the sacrifice"
8416,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,(_ib._ 440 ff.) suggests an open-air shrine. Besides these we have
8417,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,a general reference to temples among the Phaeacians (Od. VI 10) and
8418,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,a vow made by Odysseus' followers to construct a temple to Helios
8419,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,on their return home (_ib._ XII 346). Now it is held that all these
8420,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,passages belong to a late stage in the growth of the poems and that in
8421,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,their original form temples were unknown. Sanctuaries of the earlier
8422,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,period are described only by such terms as ἄλσος or τέμενος βωμός τε
8423,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,θυήεις. There can be little doubt that the grove and the open-air
8424,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,shrine represent more primitive types of sanctuary than the temple.
8425,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,But the advocates of this theory seem to have overlooked the fact that
8426,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,among many peoples the more primitive and the more developed forms of
8427,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,sanctuary are found existing side by side[326]. Thus beside the great
8428,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"temple at Upsala, the chief sanctuary of the North, there stood a grove"
8429,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"which appears to have been regarded with still greater veneration,"
8430,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,even down to the very end of heathen times. Close by was a spring in
8431,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,which human victims were sacrificed[327]. This case shows how entirely
8432,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"unjustifiable it is to assume the non-existence of a temple, when"
8433,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,only a shrine or sacred grove happens to be mentioned. We may cite
8434,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,as an example the proposed sacrifice to Spercheios in Il. XXIII 145
8435,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,ff.[328] In general however the Homeric evidence clearly suggests
8436,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that temples--and the same may possibly be the case with images--were
8437,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"chiefly to be found in cities, while the more primitive forms of"
8438,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,sanctuary remained in less populous places.
8439,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8440,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,I cannot but think that to any student of comparative religion the
8441,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,argument derived from the references to sanctuaries will appear
8442,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,entirely worthless. The argument against the antiquity of the round
8443,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,shield also can hardly be maintained. Of the rest all except the one
8444,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,based on the use of the metals contain a certain element of doubt.
8445,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,But even if we grant their validity in every case it cannot be said
8446,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that either individually or collectively they necessitate the lapse
8447,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of a long interval between the earlier and later portions of the
8448,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,poems. If the interval had amounted to anything like three centuries
8449,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,discrepancies of a far more striking character must have come to light.
8450,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8451,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,*       *       *       *       *
8452,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8453,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,As yet we have taken no account of linguistic inconsistencies. The
8454,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,poems as we have them present a medley of forms belonging to different
8455,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,ages and different dialects. But these inconsistencies appear
8456,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,everywhere; it is not the case that certain portions of the poems
8457,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,contain only early forms and others only late ones. The Odyssey is
8458,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"said to contain a certain number of apparently late usages, especially"
8459,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"of prepositions and conjunctions, which are wanting or only occur"
8460,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,rarely in the Iliad. It is held also that within the poems themselves
8461,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,earlier and later portions can be distinguished to a certain extent by
8462,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,similar differences of usage. But the evidence on the whole is slight
8463,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,and generally somewhat ambiguous[329]; and consequently linguistic
8464,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,criteria have as a rule played only a subordinate part in the attempts
8465,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,which have been made to determine the stratification of the poems. We
8466,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,must conclude then either that the later parts were composed in an
8467,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"artificial type of language, thoroughly permeated with archaisms, or"
8468,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that the earlier parts have undergone a very considerable amount of
8469,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,modernisation. Indeed the latter explanation must be admitted to some
8470,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,extent in any case; for relatively modern forms occur frequently in
8471,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,what are usually regarded as the very earliest parts of the poems. But
8472,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,if the preservation of the poems was dependent on oral tradition for
8473,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,any considerable length of time it is very difficult to set a limit to
8474,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the operations of such a process. In Anglo-Saxon poems--even in those
8475,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,which were not entirely dependent on oral tradition--modernisation
8476,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,prevailed to such an extent that archaic forms disappeared practically
8477,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"everywhere, while substitutions of one word for another were very"
8478,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,frequent. The more elaborate character of Greek metre doubtless acted
8479,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"as a check on this tendency to change, but at the same time I cannot"
8480,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,help thinking that its importance in the history of Homeric poetry has
8481,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,been greatly underrated.
8482,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8483,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,On the question of dialect something more must be said. It is true no
8484,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,doubt that the language of the poems as we have them must be regarded
8485,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,as Ionic--but only with certain reservations. In the first place
8486,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"we have to note the regular preservation of _h-_, which in strict"
8487,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Ionic--the language of the Asiatic coast--was lost in the seventh
8488,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"century, if not earlier. Again, we find a considerable number of forms"
8489,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"which cannot be assigned to any Ionic dialect, e.g. such as contain"
8490,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"_-ā-_ (λαός, Ἀτρείδαο, αἰχμητάων). Special attention must be paid to"
8491,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"forms which are definitely Aeolic, such as πίσυρες, ἄμμε, ἐρεβεννός."
8492,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Whatever may be the explanation of the preservation of _h-_, it is"
8493,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,universally agreed that the Aeolic element is deeply rooted in the
8494,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,history of Homeric poetry. Some scholars indeed hold that the poems
8495,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,were originally composed in Aeolic and that their present form is
8496,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,practically an Ionic translation. The more general view however is that
8497,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Ionic was the language of epic composition from the beginning and that
8498,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,such forms as πίσυρες and ἄμμε are derived from early Aeolic lays on
8499,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,which the epics were for the most part based.
8500,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8501,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,The legends as to Homer's birthplace are perhaps not without
8502,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"significance for this question. In ancient times, from Pindar[330]"
8503,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"downwards, Smyrna's claim to this honour was the one most generally"
8504,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"recognised, and the majority of modern scholars are inclined to the"
8505,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,view that the birthplace of Homeric poetry is to be sought in or
8506,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"around that city. Now Smyrna was originally an Aeolic state, but was"
8507,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"captured by the Ionians of Colophon[331], apparently towards the close"
8508,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"of the eighth century, from which time onwards it appears as Ionic."
8509,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,The mixture of dialect found in the poems--an older stratum of Aeolic
8510,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,underlying a later stratum of Ionic--would therefore be perfectly
8511,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"in accord with what we know of the history of the city, although"
8512,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,unfortunately no early inscriptions are extant[332].
8513,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8514,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"The most serious competitor of Smyrna was Chios, the claim of which"
8515,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,found favour with several of our earliest authorities. Especially
8516,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,important is the fact that in a fragment published among the remains of
8517,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Simonides of Ceos (fragm. 85, Bergk), but now frequently attributed to"
8518,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Semonides of Samos, who lived about the middle of the seventh century,"
8519,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,a verse of the Iliad (VI 146) is ascribed to the 'man of Chios.' In
8520,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,this island also there dwelt in later times a clan called Ὁμηρίδαι[333]
8521,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,who claimed descent from the poet. But here again there is a tradition
8522,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"that the population was at least in part Aeolic[334]. Moreover, though"
8523,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the language of the earliest extant inscriptions is Ionic in its main
8524,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"features, it possesses certain Aeolic characteristics, especially"
8525,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the change of _ō̆n_ to _ō̆i_[335] before _s_ (e.g. πρήξοισι, λάβωισι"
8526,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"against Ion. πρήξουσι, λάβωσι). There is no record of an Ionic conquest"
8527,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"of the island, as in the case of Smyrna, but we know that it did not"
8528,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"enter the Ionic confederation until a comparatively late period,"
8529,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,probably the seventh century[336].
8530,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8531,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,It appears then that the peculiarities of Homeric language can be
8532,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,satisfactorily accounted for by the history of either Smyrna or
8533,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Chios[337]. But now we are confronted with a very grave difficulty.
8534,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,The same scholars who hold that Smyrna was the birthplace of Homeric
8535,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,poetry yet insist that the language of the epics themselves was never
8536,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"anything else than Ionic, although they allow that the Iliad was nearly"
8537,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,complete some considerable time before the conquest of Smyrna. This
8538,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"position is quite incomprehensible to me. The only explanation offered,"
8539,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"so far as I am aware, is that the language of this district may have"
8540,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,been of a mixed character[338]. It is no doubt true that when the coast
8541,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,was first occupied settlers may have come from many different quarters.
8542,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,But when Mimnermos speaks of the capture of 'Aeolic Smyrna' we are
8543,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,surely not justified in assuming that the city had become Ionicised
8544,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,before that time. On the other hand the supposition that the two
8545,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,dialects were not yet differentiated to any considerable extent appears
8546,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to me to be irreconcilable with the evidence of the poems themselves as
8547,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,well as with all that we know of the history of the Greek dialects.
8548,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8549,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,The question which we are discussing is one which concerns not only
8550,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the Iliad and Odyssey, together perhaps with certain Hymns and other"
8551,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Homeric poems, but also the various works attributed to Hesiod. In"
8552,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"particular we may note the Works and Days and the Theogony, both of"
8553,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,which claim to be of Boeotian origin. Whether by chance or not they
8554,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"contain few forms[339] which are peculiar to Aeolic proper, i.e. the"
8555,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,dialect of Asiatic Aeolis. But in all other respects their language is
8556,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"of the Homeric type, i.e. generally speaking Ionic, though with certain"
8557,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"reservations, notably that ϝ is generally kept and _ᾱ_ frequently"
8558,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"occurs before ο, ω. Now it cannot be contended seriously that this"
8559,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,extraordinary mixed dialect sprang up naturally on both sides of the
8560,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Aegean. The only alternative however is to suppose that Boeotian poets
8561,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,borrowed it from Asia. But is this really probable at such a time?
8562,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8563,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Before leaving this subject we must notice briefly the alternative
8564,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,theory that the Homeric poems were originally composed in Aeolic.
8565,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,According to the form in which this theory has become most widely known
8566,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,they were translated into Ionic at a comparatively late date--towards
8567,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the close of the sixth century[340]. It is rather a serious objection
8568,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to this hypothesis that the poems contain no trace of late Aeolic
8569,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"characteristics, such as the change of _n_ to _i_ before _s_ (e.g."
8570,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"τοίς, παῖσα). Further, if the poems had been known so long in Aeolic,"
8571,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"though doubt might have prevailed as to Homer's birthplace, the fact"
8572,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that he was an Aeolian could never have been called in question. Above
8573,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,all it is difficult to see how the need of a translation could have
8574,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"arisen at such a date, for the Aeolic dialect was then well known"
8575,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,throughout the Greek world through the poems of Alcaeus and Sappho.
8576,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8577,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,On the other hand there can be no possible objection in principle to
8578,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the idea that the poems have undergone a change of dialect. We have
8579,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,seen that a large proportion of Anglo-Saxon poetry has passed through
8580,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"a similar process, generally from one English dialect to another,"
8581,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"but occasionally, as in the case of Genesis (vv. 235-851), from a"
8582,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,continental to an English dialect. In some few cases we still have
8583,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"parallel texts preserved in different dialects[341]. Indeed, when"
8584,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the poetry of one community becomes current in another community, it"
8585,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,would seem that under certain conditions such changes were not merely
8586,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,possible but even inevitable. This is a question to which we shall have
8587,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to return in the course of the next few pages.
8588,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8589,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,*       *       *       *       *
8590,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8591,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,There is still one vexed question which we have not as yet touched
8592,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"upon, namely the relationship of the Homeric poems to the art of"
8593,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,writing. Wolf and his immediate successors held that the art was
8594,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,unknown when these poems came into existence. Among more recent
8595,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,scholars however the general tendency has been to regard this view as
8596,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,mistaken. Some leading authorities even hold that considerable portions
8597,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of the poems were written down from the time of their composition.
8598,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8599,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"The poems themselves contain only one reference to writing, namely in"
8600,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Il. VI 168 ff., where it is stated that Proitos sent Bellerophon to"
8601,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Lycia ""and gave him baneful tokens, writing many deadly things in a"
8602,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"folded tablet, which he bade him show to his (Proitos') father-in-law,"
8603,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"with a view to his own destruction[342]."" So long as no further"
8604,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,evidence was forthcoming there was a natural inclination either to
8605,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,regard this passage as an interpolation or to interpret it as denoting
8606,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,something which could not properly be called writing. But of late years
8607,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"archaeological investigation has brought to light, especially in Crete,"
8608,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"numerous inscriptions dating from very remote times, and there cannot"
8609,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,now be any question as to the antiquity of writing in the southern
8610,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Aegean. Moreover the Homeric poets themselves can hardly have been
8611,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"ignorant of the existence of such an art, for rock-hewn figures with"
8612,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,inscriptions dating from pre-Homeric times--including one which has
8613,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,been identified with the figure of 'Niobe' mentioned in Il. XXIV 614
8614,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,ff.--are to be found quite close to the Asiatic coast.
8615,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8616,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Yet in spite of all this it is a very remarkable fact that the whole
8617,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"28,000 verses of the Iliad and Odyssey contain only one reference to"
8618,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,writing. The significance of this may be appreciated by turning to
8619,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"modern Servian poetry, which abounds with allusions to letters and"
8620,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"written orders, although the minstrels themselves are quite ignorant"
8621,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,both of reading and writing. It is true that in Beowulf we find only
8622,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,one direct reference to writing. But the Iliad and Odyssey together
8623,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,contain nearly nine times as many verses as Beowulf.
8624,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8625,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,On the whole it seems to me that the evidence for the antiquity
8626,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of writing given above does not prove exactly what it is commonly
8627,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,supposed to do. The inscriptions on the rock-hewn figures are Hittite.
8628,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"The ancient Cretan inscriptions have not yet been deciphered, and"
8629,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in view of the later inscriptions found at Praisos the probability
8630,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,as yet is distinctly against their being in the Greek language. But
8631,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"in any case they date from ages long anterior to Homeric times, and"
8632,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,there is nothing to prove their continuity with the writing of the
8633,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,historical period. With regard to the passage in Il. VI 168 ff. it
8634,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,is to be observed firstly that Proitos is one of the very earliest
8635,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,persons mentioned in the poems--some three generations removed from
8636,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the characters of the Trojan story--and secondly that the curious
8637,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,phraseology seems rather to suggest that the poet was speaking of
8638,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,something which he did not clearly understand. On the whole then it is
8639,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,much to be doubted whether writing was a current and native practice
8640,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,during the period when the poems were composed.
8641,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8642,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,A reservation should perhaps be made with regard to the latest elements
8643,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"in the poems. Although definite evidence is wanting, the beginnings of"
8644,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the Greek alphabet may quite probably go back to the ninth century, and"
8645,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,it may very well be that the poems had not then attained their final
8646,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,form. But it should not be assumed that the alphabet was introduced
8647,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,simultaneously throughout the Greek world. Some districts may have
8648,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"acquired it generations before others, and Aeolis (including even Chios"
8649,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"and Smyrna) was probably not one of the more advanced. Further, we must"
8650,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,admit that in all probability its use was at first very limited. From
8651,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"all analogies we should expect that it was employed for inscriptions,"
8652,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"correspondence, etc. for a very long time before it was made to serve"
8653,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,any literary purpose. Such apparently was the case with the alphabet of
8654,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,ancient Rome and with the Runic alphabet almost throughout its history.
8655,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Unless the conditions in Greece were quite exceptional we should not
8656,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,expect the alphabet to come into contact with heroic poetry for a
8657,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,considerable time.
8658,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8659,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,The theory that certain portions of the poems were written down from
8660,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the beginning presupposes of course a use of writing quite different
8661,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,from that which is brought before us in the story of Bellerophon. This
8662,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"theory[343] is, and necessarily must be, bound up with another theory,"
8663,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"which we have already discussed, that these portions date from a period"
8664,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,not earlier than the seventh century. Our discussion has led us to the
8665,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,conclusion that the evidence for the latter theory is unsatisfactory.
8666,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"But, apart from this, it is inconceivable that the 'literary' portions,"
8667,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"which are said to amount to several thousand verses, should contain no"
8668,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"reference, direct or indirect, to the use of writing. In Beowulf we"
8669,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,find only one direct reference to writing (v. 1694 f.)--an inscription
8670,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in Runic letters such as had long been in use. But in the Christian
8671,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,additions or 'interpolations' we meet with three examples of the verb
8672,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"_scrifan_ (_forscrifan_, _gescrifan_--from Lat. _scribere_), which"
8673,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"of course is indirect evidence for the use of writing, though in a"
8674,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,different language[344]. If large portions of the Homeric poems were
8675,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,really of literary origin the authors could scarcely have failed to
8676,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"betray themselves by usages of this kind, even though they deliberately"
8677,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,avoided all mention of writing.
8678,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8679,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,In addition to this general consideration we have to take account of
8680,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the linguistic difficulties discussed above. We have seen that Hesiod's
8681,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"works show almost the same form of language as the Homeric poems,"
8682,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,although the Boeotian dialect was quite different from anything spoken
8683,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"on the other side of the Aegean. Did Hesiod, who lived in the eighth"
8684,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"century, probably before the Ionian conquest of Smyrna, really employ"
8685,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the 'impure Ionic' in which his poems have come down to us? He himself
8686,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,says (W. and D. 650 ff.) that he had never crossed the sea except
8687,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,(once apparently) to Chalcis. Presumably then his knowledge of heroic
8688,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"poetry was derived either from Boeotia, where he lived, or from Cyme in"
8689,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Aeolis, from whence his father had emigrated. But Cyme never came into"
8690,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Ionian hands. Are we to suppose then that either here or in Boeotia
8691,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,poets were already employing as their vehicle a form of language which
8692,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,according to the theory under discussion owed its existence (whether
8693,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in ordinary speech or only in poetry) to certain political changes in
8694,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,a third district--changes too which had hardly begun much before the
8695,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,time of Hesiod? This hypothesis seems to me quite incredible[345].
8696,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8697,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,On the other hand if Hesiod's poems have undergone a change of dialect
8698,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,since their original composition may not the Homeric poems have
8699,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,passed through the same process? In this case of course such a change
8700,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,would come about quite naturally if Smyrna or Chios was the original
8701,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,home of the poems. But here we must notice a curious feature in the
8702,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,'epic dialect' to which we have already referred. Except in Aeolic
8703,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,forms--and this exception deserves to be remarked--the poems almost
8704,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,always preserve initial _h-_[346]. This is a characteristic which the
8705,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,'epic dialect' shares with western or European Ionic but not with the
8706,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,language of the Asiatic coast[347]. Its presence raises a distinct
8707,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,difficulty in the way of supposing that the poems were Ionicised in
8708,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,their original home.
8709,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8710,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Now if the Homeric poems had been written down in Aeolic and preserved
8711,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in literary form we can hardly doubt that they would have retained
8712,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"their original dialect, just like the works of Alcman, Alcaeus, and"
8713,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Sappho. It must not be argued that Ionic was the proper language of
8714,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the epic, Doric and Aeolic of the lyric; for if the Homeric poems had"
8715,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,become generally known in Aeolic nothing could have prevented this
8716,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,dialect from becoming the language of the epic also. We may assume then
8717,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that they were not transmitted in written Aeolic. But the same argument
8718,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,really militates against the theory that they were written in Asiatic
8719,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Ionic[348], though in this case the difference of dialect is less"
8720,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,striking.
8721,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8722,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,A form of language practically identical with that of the epics
8723,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,appears in the remains of several poets of the seventh and sixth
8724,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"centuries, such as Archilochos and Solon. The only noticeable"
8725,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,difference is in the proportion of non-Ionic forms which they use. Now
8726,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"since these authors belonged to quite different districts we must, if"
8727,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"we are to trust our evidence, infer the existence of a kind of literary"
8728,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,language at this time. Its difference from Asiatic Ionic is of course
8729,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"comparatively slight, and in the texts which have come down to us it is"
8730,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,not always carefully observed[349]. Still there is a sufficient amount
8731,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of regularity to show that it was generally recognised.
8732,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8733,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"The true home of this literary language must not be sought in Athens,"
8734,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,but rather in Euboea or the Cyclades; and we may probably attribute
8735,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"its spread, in part at least, to the influence of the poems of"
8736,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Archilochos. But it certainly affected the writing of Attic for some
8737,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"two centuries, and there can be little doubt that it was thoroughly"
8738,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,domiciled in Athens at quite an early date--probably in the seventh
8739,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,century. I cannot see any objection therefore to supposing that it
8740,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,was in Athens that both the Homeric and Hesiodic poems acquired those
8741,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,peculiar linguistic characteristics which we comprehend under the
8742,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,term 'epic dialect.' This of course brings us back to the story that
8743,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the poems were collected or written down by order of Peisistratos.
8744,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"The evidence for the story is late, and its truth is hotly contested"
8745,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,by many scholars. But at all events it has the merit of providing a
8746,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,satisfactory explanation of the linguistic phenomena.
8747,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8748,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Certainly, if we may judge from the analogy of other peoples, heroic"
8749,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,poetry would not by any means be among the first species of literature
8750,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to get committed to writing. There is no reason whatever for supposing
8751,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that anything of this kind was written down in England before the
8752,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"eighth century, i.e. at least a century after the language was first"
8753,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"applied to literary purposes, in Aethelberht's time. The same remark"
8754,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"seems to be true of Ireland, Germany and the North, while Bosnian"
8755,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"heroic poetry is being written down only in our own generation, and not"
8756,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,by natives of the country. It is only natural therefore to expect that
8757,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the Homeric poems would be written down according to an orthography
8758,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,which was already well established.
8759,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8760,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,This orthography no doubt represents more or less truly the form in
8761,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,which the poems were recited in Athens at the time. But does it also
8762,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,represent the form in which they were recited at (let us say) Sicyon?
8763,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,That is a question upon which we have no direct evidence. But it is
8764,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,worth noting that in Doric and other non-Ionic states we find a number
8765,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of ancient inscriptions in hexameters or elegiacs which contain epic
8766,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"words and forms. We may note especially the Gen. sg. ending -οιο, e.g."
8767,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"κασιγνετοιο, οδοιο, Αραθθοιο, and above all false imitations of epic"
8768,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"forms, such as Τλασκιαϝο[350]. But in all these inscriptions Ionic"
8769,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,characteristics are conspicuously absent[351]. Does this mean that
8770,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,wherever the heroic poems were introduced the rhapsodists tried to
8771,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"accommodate them, as far as possible, to the language of the district?"
8772,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"But if so, is it possible that the Ionic element in our texts is"
8773,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,wholly due to the rhapsodists? A Chalcidian or Naxian or Athenian
8774,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,audience would certainly experience at least as much difficulty in
8775,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,following a purely Aeolic Iliad as a southern English audience would
8776,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,have in listening to a purely Northumbrian or Mercian Beowulf. On the
8777,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,other hand an Iliad Ionicised in Chalcis or Naxos would be easily
8778,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,intelligible in Athens[352].
8779,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8780,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,At all events we have seen that there is a very serious objection on
8781,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,chronological grounds to the view that Hesiod's poems were composed
8782,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in a form of 'impure Ionic' borrowed from the Asiatic coast. In this
8783,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,case it is surely far more probable that the Ionic element is due
8784,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"to the rhapsodists, whether in Chalcis or Athens. But is there any"
8785,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,real reason for denying that the Homeric poems may have had a similar
8786,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,experience? This is a question which I do not feel qualified to answer.
8787,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,But it seems to me to deserve more attention from scholars than it has
8788,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,received as yet.
8789,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8790,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,*       *       *       *       *
8791,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8792,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,In this chapter we have seen that the Homeric poems contain elements
8793,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of great antiquity. Although we have no means of fixing an exact date
8794,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"for these elements, we can hardly doubt that they originated at a"
8795,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,time before iron had come into general use for weapons. According to
8796,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the prevailing opinion of archaeologists this innovation cannot have
8797,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,taken place after the tenth century. We need not suppose that any
8798,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,considerable portions of the poems in their present form date from such
8799,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"an early period. But the 'type' must have been fixed by that time, and"
8800,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to a considerable extent also the subject-matter.
8801,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8802,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Still more clearly we have seen that there is no ground for supposing
8803,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that the earlier and later elements are separated from one another
8804,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,by a wide interval. For the idea that the earlier elements reflect
8805,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the conditions of the last age of Mycenean splendour--probably about
8806,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the thirteenth century--while the later elements betray acquaintance
8807,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"with conditions of the seventh century, we have not been able to find"
8808,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,any justification. The period intervening between the Mycenean age
8809,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,and the beginning of the classical age is certainly one which has as
8810,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,yet yielded comparatively little to archaeological research. But our
8811,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,discussion has led us to infer that the conditions of life reflected
8812,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"in the poems throughout belong to some part of this period, rather"
8813,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,than that they are due to a combination taken from the preceding and
8814,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,following ages[353] with a more or less blank interval of some five or
8815,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,six centuries.
8816,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8817,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,I have spoken advisedly of earlier and later 'elements' rather than of
8818,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"earlier and later 'portions' in the poems. Elaborate analyses, such as"
8819,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"that proposed for the Odyssey by Prof. von Wilamowitz-Möllendorff, are"
8820,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,admittedly hopeless unless we assent to the hypothesis that the person
8821,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,responsible for the final form of the poem possessed a written text;
8822,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,and we have seen that this hypothesis is open to grave objections. The
8823,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,existence of different strata in the work must doubtless be conceded.
8824,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,We may even allow that it is built up out of shorter epics. But I
8825,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,cannot admit that such a poem as the Odyssey can be successfully
8826,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"constructed out of shorter ones by stringing the latter together,"
8827,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,even if we do grant that the additions made by the editor amount to
8828,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,a sixth part of the whole[354]. It is questionable therefore whether
8829,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,we are justified in regarding the last stratum as the work of an
8830,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,'editor'--whether we ought not rather to regard this person as the
8831,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"'author' of our poem. He must have used earlier pieces, and he may have"
8832,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,incorporated them in large mass in his work. But we have no guarantee
8833,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that he did not greatly expand his materials as well as provide
8834,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,connecting links between them.
8835,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
8836,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,In the Iliad we are confronted to a certain extent with the same
8837,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,problems. But the process of unification does not appear to have
8838,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,been carried out so thoroughly and the proportion of early matter
8839,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,incorporated is probably much greater. The point however which I would
8840,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,especially emphasise in both cases alike is that the unification
8841,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,process cannot be used as an argument for lateness of date. If we bear
8842,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"in mind the undoubtedly archaic character of both poems, the paucity of"
8843,THE HOMERIC POEMS.,inconsistencies points to an entirely opposite conclusion. The greater

9201,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9202,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9203,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,In Chapter V we saw that four well-marked stages may be distinguished
9204,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,in the history of Teutonic heroic poetry. The first is that of strictly
9205,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"contemporary court poetry, dealing with the praises or the adventures"
9206,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"of living men. The second is that of epic or narrative court poetry,"
9207,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"which celebrates the deeds of heroes of the past, though not of a very"
9208,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"remote past. The third is the popular stage, during which the same"
9209,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,stories were handled by village minstrels. The last stage is that in
9210,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,which the old subjects again found favour with the nobility in Germany
9211,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,and were treated in a new form which reflected the conditions of the
9212,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,age of chivalry. We must now see whether any such stages can be traced
9213,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,in the history of Greek heroic poetry.
9214,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9215,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,For the first stage plenty of evidence is supplied by the Homeric
9216,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,poems. In the Odyssey we meet with several persons who seem to be
9217,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,professional court minstrels. Such are Demodocos at the court of
9218,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"Alcinoos and Phemios at that of Odysseus, while others are mentioned at"
9219,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the courts of Agamemnon and Menelaos. Both Demodocos and Phemios are
9220,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"represented as singing of recent events, namely the adventures of the"
9221,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"Achaeans on their return from Troy, though the former also produces"
9222,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,one song upon a mythical subject. The song or recitation is invariably
9223,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"accompanied upon a lyre, probably much in the same way as the Teutonic"
9224,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,minstrel used his harp[356].
9225,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9226,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"As among the Teutonic peoples, we hear also occasionally of royal"
9227,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"minstrels. Paris appears to be a skilful musician (Il. III 54), while"
9228,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Achilles is amusing himself by singing the 'glories of heroes' (κλέα
9229,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,ἀνδρῶν) when he is visited by Aias and Odysseus (_ib._ IX 189). But the
9230,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"status of even the professional minstrel was, sometimes at least, one"
9231,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"of considerable importance. Agamemnon, on his departure to Troy, is"
9232,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,said to have entrusted his queen to the care of a certain minstrel (Od.
9233,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,III 267 f.)--a case which may be compared with several Teutonic stories
9234,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,relating both to the Heroic Age and the Viking Age. The Phaeacian
9235,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"minstrel Demodocos is blind, like the Frisian Bernlef; but, unlike the"
9236,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"latter, he seems to have a recognised position at Alcinoos' court."
9237,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,He is evidently regarded as a person of distinction; in VIII 483 we
9238,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"find him described as ἥρως, a term frequently applied to princes. For"
9239,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,minstrels of Bernlef's type we have no clear evidence in the Homeric
9240,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,poems. In Od. XVII 382 ff. we hear of invitations given to minstrels;
9241,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,but the reference may be to persons of Widsith's class. The same seems
9242,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,to be true of the Thracian minstrel Thamyris mentioned in Il. II 595
9243,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,ff.; for it is stated that he was coming from Eurytos of Oichalia when
9244,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,disaster befell him.
9245,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9246,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,On the whole then the court minstrelsy of the Homeric poems bears a
9247,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"striking resemblance to that of the Teutonic Heroic Age. We cannot,"
9248,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"it is true, obtain any corroborative evidence for its existence from"
9249,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,contemporary historical documents. But the negative evidence is almost
9250,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,as decisive. Even in the earliest times of which we have record no
9251,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,trace of such an institution is to be found in Greece. We hear of
9252,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,rhapsodists at Sicyon as early as the beginning of the sixth century;
9253,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"but they are clearly persons of Bernlef's type, reciting 'Homeric'"
9254,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"poems, i.e. stories of ancient times. Moreover they were viewed with"
9255,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,disfavour by the ruler. Another type of professional poet may be seen
9256,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,in such persons as Alcman. These were what may be called 'state-poets';
9257,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,sometimes they were trainers of the state choruses. But there is
9258,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"nothing to show that they were court poets. We hear also of poets,"
9259,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"sometimes men of noble birth, like Eumelos, who composed hymns for"
9260,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,festal occasions. But these too worked for the glorification of the
9261,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"state, or indeed for that of any state which employed them, and their"
9262,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,position was essentially different from that of the court minstrel who
9263,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,composes for his lord's gratification. Minstrelsy of the Homeric type
9264,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"is conceivable only in an age of real kingship, and it is incredible"
9265,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,that such a type could have been invented after that institution had
9266,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,ceased to exist. Indeed the nearest Greek analogy to it is probably to
9267,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,be found in such poets as Anacreon who flourished at the courts of the
9268,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,later tyrants. Their poems however dealt with an entirely different
9269,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,class of subjects.
9270,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9271,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,It is true that minstrels are mentioned beside kings in a passage
9272,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"in Hesiod's Theogony (v. 94 ff.), both being said to derive their"
9273,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,endowment from divine sources[357]. But there is nothing to show that
9274,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,these were court minstrels. At all events it is clear enough from
9275,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"another passage in the same poem (v. 22 ff.), as well as from the Works"
9276,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"and Days, that Hesiod himself was not a man of this type. Moreover,"
9277,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the subjects with which the minstrels are said to deal are the 'famous
9278,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,deeds (glories) of men of old' (κλέεα προτέρων ἀνθρώπων). The reference
9279,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"then is to heroic poetry, but in a stage not earlier than Stage II of"
9280,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,our scheme. The passage however is undoubtedly interesting as showing a
9281,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,stage intermediate between Homeric minstrels and the later rhapsodists.
9282,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,From the word κιθαρισταί we may perhaps infer that the musical
9283,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"accompaniment, which the latter seem to have discarded, was still in"
9284,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,use.

9287,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9288,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Probably no one will suggest that the Homeric poems themselves are
9289,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,products of the type of minstrelsy (Stage I) which we have been
9290,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,considering. Now therefore we must try to ascertain which of the other
9291,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,three stages they correspond to. Curiously enough no such question as
9292,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,this appears to have been discussed in any of the numerous Homeric
9293,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,researches which the last half century has produced. Nearly all writers
9294,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,have completely ignored the existence of the Anglo-Saxon heroic poems.
9295,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"On the other hand medieval German poems, such as the Nibelungenlied,"
9296,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"have been freely used in illustration of Homeric problems, and there"
9297,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,can be no question that in many respects the supposed analogy has had
9298,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,far-reaching influence on their interpretation. In the application of
9299,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,these illustrations as a rule no account whatever has been taken of
9300,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,what we may call the stratification of Teutonic heroic poetry.
9301,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9302,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Let us now consider briefly the history of the Nibelungenlied. We have
9303,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,seen that the origin of the story is to be sought in poems composed
9304,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"probably within memory of certain events with which it deals, and that"
9305,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the subject appears to have been worked up into a somewhat elaborate
9306,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,form within the next two centuries. It can scarcely be doubted that
9307,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,these early poems were products of court-minstrelsy and that their
9308,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,form was that of the old Teutonic alliterative verse. Later however
9309,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,there came a time when all heroic poetry passed out of fashion among
9310,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"the higher classes, and when this story, like the rest, must have been"
9311,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"preserved only by village minstrels. Then, after a lapse of several"
9312,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"centuries, it appears again in an entirely different metrical form,"
9313,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,and permeated through and through with the ideas and customs of the
9314,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,age of chivalry. Little beyond the bare outlines of the story can have
9315,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"been inherited from the original poems, and even these appear to have"
9316,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,undergone considerable modification.
9317,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9318,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"Now if the history of Homeric poetry is really parallel to this, we"
9319,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,shall have to suppose that the stories were first treated in court
9320,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,poetry about the close of the pre-migration period; that after
9321,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,flourishing for a while they fell out of favour in royal circles and
9322,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"were preserved only by village minstrels, at whose hands they underwent"
9323,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,a long process of disintegration; and that finally they formed the
9324,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,basis of new aristocratic poems some six or seven centuries after they
9325,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,first saw the light. In order to present a complete parallel the later
9326,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"poems must use a new metrical form, of foreign derivation, which will"
9327,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,preclude the possibility of their containing a single verse of the
9328,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,original poems. The customs and ideas too which they reflect must be
9329,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"wholly, or almost wholly, those of their own period, and not those of"
9330,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the Heroic Age.
9331,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9332,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,But it is manifest that this description will not fit the Homeric
9333,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,poems in any way. According to the opinion held by the majority of
9334,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,scholars the customs and ideas reflected by the Homeric poems are
9335,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"inconsistent--sometimes they are those of the Heroic Age, sometimes"
9336,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,those of the poets' own age. Indeed many scholars hold that the
9337,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,former type predominates. Personally I am not ready to admit that
9338,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the difference between the two ages was anything like so great as is
9339,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,commonly assumed. But in any case it must be granted that in some
9340,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"respects, e.g. in regard to political geography and the use of the"
9341,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"metals, the conditions of the Heroic Age are truly reflected almost"
9342,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,everywhere. Further it is commonly held that considerable portions of
9343,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"the poems go back, more or less in their present form, not perhaps"
9344,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"to the Heroic Age itself, but at all events a long distance in that"
9345,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"direction. We must conclude therefore that, unless modern criticism has"
9346,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"gone hopelessly astray, the Nibelungenlied presents no true analogy to"
9347,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the history of the Homeric poems.
9348,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9349,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Now let us take the Anglo-Saxon heroic poems. It is obvious enough that
9350,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,here there is at all events a superficial resemblance between the two
9351,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"cases, although the Greek poems are on a much larger scale. Both sets"
9352,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"of poems are the work of colonists who had crossed the sea, and both"
9353,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,equally suppress all reference to the existence of such settlements. It
9354,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,is true that the scene of the Iliad is laid in a district not far from
9355,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,that in which it appears to have been composed. But this district is
9356,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,represented as being in possession of an alien people. The compatriots
9357,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,of the poets--who clearly speak from the Achaean side--are uniformly
9358,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,represented as dwelling on the west of the Aegean. But these after all
9359,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,are merely accidental coincidences. Far more important for us is the
9360,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"fact, which we have already noted, that both sets of poems carry the"
9361,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,history of heroic poetry back to court minstrels who are represented as
9362,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,living in the Heroic Age itself. The question which we have to face is
9363,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,whether or not the Iliad and Odyssey likewise resemble the Anglo-Saxon
9364,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,poems in being themselves products of court-minstrelsy in direct
9365,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,continuation of that which they depict as existing in the Heroic Age.
9366,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9367,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"If this question is incapable of being answered we must, I think,"
9368,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,conclude that the historical study of early Greek poetry is futile. No
9369,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,impartial observer can fail to have been struck by the immense strides
9370,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"made within the last generation by Greek archaeology, as compared with"
9371,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the very small amount of progress made from the literary side--at
9372,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,least if progress is to be judged by the attainment of any general
9373,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,consensus of opinion. Experienced archaeologists can now very soon
9374,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,determine whether the remains which they find are those of a village
9375,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"or a palace, and whether they belong to (let us say) the classical"
9376,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"or the geometrical or the Mycenean period. Again, in the case of"
9377,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,sites long occupied they can easily detect the existence of different
9378,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,strata--especially if a palace has been built on the site of an
9379,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"earlier village, or if a village settlement has intervened between two"
9380,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,'palace-periods.' Is it really impossible to distinguish such strata
9381,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"in the history of poetry, or is the absence of progress which we have"
9382,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,noted to be attributed to other causes--perhaps that the criticism has
9383,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,been of too subjective a character?
9384,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9385,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Now it is almost universally agreed that the Homeric poems are
9386,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,considerably older than any other form of Greek literature which has
9387,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,come down to us. Some scholars indeed hold that the latest portions of
9388,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the Odyssey belong to the seventh century; but we have seen that the
9389,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,evidence for this view is by no means satisfactory. Certainly by the
9390,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"middle of the seventh century, and probably somewhat earlier, we meet"
9391,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,with totally different types of poetry. In the first place we find a
9392,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"number of new metrical forms, elegiac, iambic and trochaic, not to"
9393,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,speak of the numerous varieties of lyric metre. In matter and in spirit
9394,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,too the difference is just as marked as it is in form. The new poets
9395,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,are primarily concerned with the affairs of their own day. Callinos and
9396,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Tyrtaios are inspired by national patriotism. Their fragments may be
9397,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"compared with the poem on the battle of Brunanburh, though even this is"
9398,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,nearer to the heroic spirit. Archilochos again is almost entirely taken
9399,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,up with his own experiences and passions. A good analogy for his case
9400,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,is to be found in the Icelandic adventurer Egill Skallagrímsson. In all
9401,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,respects then the poetry of this age is as far removed as possible from
9402,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the heroic type of poetry.
9403,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9404,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Yet traces of an intermediate or transitional stage are not altogether
9405,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,wanting. From the fragments of the Hesiodic Catalogue and other works
9406,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,which are attributed to the close of the eighth and the early part
9407,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,of the seventh centuries it is clear that--apart from hymns--the old
9408,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,hexameter metre was retained for a time in a class of poetry which
9409,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,appears to have been largely genealogical in character. In matter
9410,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"also, as well as in form, this class had certain elements in common"
9411,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"with Homeric poetry, since both were concerned with the far past. But"
9412,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,in spirit its affinities were rather with the poetry of the following
9413,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,age; for its object seems clearly to have been the glorification of the
9414,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,state.
9415,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9416,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,These observations lead us to conclude that a sequence can be traced
9417,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"in the history of poetry, as in that of art. It is at least a natural"
9418,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,hypothesis that the great development of original poetry in the age of
9419,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Callinos and Archilochos was connected in some way with those political
9420,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,and social movements which so greatly affected the Greek world during
9421,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the eighth and seventh centuries--changing almost every kingdom into
9422,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,a republic. Moreover the existence of the transitional (genealogical)
9423,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,type of poetry which we have noted is altogether favourable to this
9424,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,idea; for the form of government which took the place of kingship
9425,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,was at first that of a strictly limited aristocracy. But have we any
9426,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,ground for believing that heroic poetry was the poetry of the age of
9427,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,kingship? How far is such an equation in accord with the chronological
9428,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,data at our disposal? In Greece itself kingship generally seems to
9429,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,have come to an end about the middle of the eighth century. In Aeolis
9430,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"however, with which we are primarily concerned, the change was in"
9431,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,all probability somewhat later; for the Phrygian king Midas (Mita of
9432,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"Muski), who perished in the Cimmerian invasion about the beginning of"
9433,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"the seventh century, is said to have married a daughter of Agamemnon,"
9434,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,king of Cyme. But few will deny that the great bulk of Homeric poetry
9435,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,was in existence by this time. The equation therefore seems to be fully
9436,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"justified. Survivals and imitations may occur in later times, as in the"
9437,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"case of art; but, broadly speaking, it appears that heroic poetry is"
9438,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,properly the poetry of the age of kingship.
9439,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9440,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,We must not assume forthwith however that it was the only type of
9441,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,poetry which existed during this age. Certain passages in Hesiod's
9442,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"poems (Theog. 80 ff., W. and D. 38 f.) render it clear that kingship"
9443,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,in some form or other still existed when they were composed; yet they
9444,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,differ very greatly from the Homeric type. Our next object therefore
9445,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,must be to try to ascertain the true provenance of Homeric poetry.
9446,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"Was it court poetry or popular poetry, or are we to trace its origin"
9447,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,to conditions which cannot well be brought under either of these
9448,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,categories?
9449,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9450,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"It cannot seriously be contended, I think, that the Homeric poems"
9451,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,are of popular origin. In the first place their length is scarcely
9452,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,compatible with such a hypothesis[358]. Their metrical form also is
9453,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,clearly the product of a long artistic development; it is inconceivable
9454,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,that popular poetry could be capable of creating anything so elaborate.
9455,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Again they are by no means in the nature of biographical sketches (cf.
9456,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,p. 95); in spite of their great length the action in both cases extends
9457,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"over quite a brief period of time. Further, there is little or no"
9458,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,definite evidence--certainly none which can be called conclusive--for
9459,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,that confusion of different stories which characterises popular poetry.
9460,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,The heroes who figure in the Homeric poems are scarcely the most
9461,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,famous representatives of their states. Most of them are little known
9462,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,elsewhere. Popular poetry could hardly have failed to introduce into
9463,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"the action such persons as Heracles, Theseus, Peirithoos, Minos, Iason"
9464,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,or Adrastos. Then again we may note the presence of nearly all those
9465,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,features which distinguish the heroic poetry of the Teutonic peoples
9466,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,(cf. p. 82 f.). The characters brought before us in the Iliad are
9467,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,almost invariably either princes or persons attached to the retinues of
9468,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"princes, and themselves apparently of what we may call knightly rank."
9469,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,The chief exception (Thersites) is described in a way which only proves
9470,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the rule. It is true that this principle is not so strictly observed
9471,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,in the latter part of the Odyssey. Several persons of humble rank
9472,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"are introduced here, though it is to be noted that the most prominent"
9473,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"of them (Eumaios, the swineherd) is said to be of princely birth. In"
9474,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,other respects however the Odyssey conforms to the rules of Teutonic
9475,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,court poetry just as much as the Iliad. Thus it is fond of describing
9476,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,in detail the movements of kings and queens in their palaces and the
9477,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"conventions observed in the reception of strangers. Again, persons of"
9478,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,princely rank are seldom spoken of with disrespect in either poem.
9479,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"Dialogues must of course be excepted, and also references (especially"
9480,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,in the Nekyia) to persons of the far past--precisely as in Teutonic
9481,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,poetry. But in general there is a noteworthy absence of any display
9482,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,of feeling against the opponents of the poet's heroes--as much in the
9483,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,case of Penelope's suitors as in that of the Trojans. Perhaps the most
9484,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,striking instance is the semi-apologetic account of Clytaimnestra's
9485,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"conduct given by Nestor (Od. III 263-272), a passage which may be"
9486,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,compared with the story of Offa's wife in Beowulf. We may note also
9487,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the surprisingly lenient treatment of Paris in the Iliad. Indeed the
9488,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,characters represented in the most unfavourable light are gods--a
9489,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"phenomenon for which we have analogies in Old Norse poetry. Lastly,"
9490,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,we must observe the strict avoidance of coarseness and of things not
9491,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,mentioned in polite society.
9492,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9493,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Before we proceed further it will be convenient to turn for a moment
9494,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,to Hesiod's poems. For these also early Teutonic literature presents
9495,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,a number of fairly close parallels. In particular the proverbial
9496,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"part of the Works and Days has many analogies in gnomic poetry, both"
9497,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,English and Scandinavian. As an example we may cite the first and last
9498,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,portions of Hávamál. Again the precepts on husbandry and the calendar
9499,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,resemble several Anglo-Saxon works both in prose and verse. For the
9500,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Theogony the closest Teutonic parallel--and it is very close--is the
9501,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"prose Gylfaginning; but earlier poetical works, such as Völuspá and"
9502,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"Hyndlulióð, run on somewhat similar lines. There is evidence too that"
9503,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"subjects of the same kind were once popular in England[359]. Lastly,"
9504,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the verses (22 ff.) which relate how the poet received his inspiration
9505,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,may be compared with the story of Caedmon.
9506,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9507,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Now if we compare the characteristics of Hesiodic and Homeric poetry
9508,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,we cannot fail to notice that they present a very striking contrast in
9509,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"several respects, even apart from the absence of a common theme. In the"
9510,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"first place Hesiod takes no pains to conceal his personality. Again,"
9511,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"his poems contain little in the way of detailed description, except"
9512,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"where the occupations of a farmer's life are discussed. Thirdly, they"
9513,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"show no tendency to avoid indelicate subjects. Lastly, they betray no"
9514,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"acquaintance with court life. Kings are occasionally mentioned, though"
9515,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"not by name, but all the references are to their public appearances, as"
9516,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,judges or mediators. We may notice too that though in the Theogony (v.
9517,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"80 ff.) they are spoken of with respect, in the Works and Days (v. 38"
9518,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,f.) the title is coupled with an opprobrious epithet (δωροφάγους). No
9519,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,one can fail to observe that in nearly all these respects[360] Hesiod
9520,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,shows the characteristics which commonly distinguish popular poetry.
9521,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9522,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,But we have to remember that in spite of all these differences Hesiod
9523,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,uses the same metrical form and to a large extent the same style of
9524,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,language as the Homeric poems. There can be little doubt that priority
9525,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,lies with the latter; indeed Hesiod frequently betrays acquaintance
9526,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,with Homeric poetry. But it must not be assumed that his themes were
9527,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,new; they are far more primitive than anything of the heroic type. If
9528,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Hesiod was the founder of a new era in poetry we must conclude that his
9529,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,innovation consisted in the application of the forms of heroic poetry
9530,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,to purposes for which they had not previously been used. The heroic
9531,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,hexameter is the only form of metre which can be traced back beyond the
9532,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"seventh century, and we can hardly doubt that it is the oldest form of"
9533,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,cultivated Greek poetry. But less elaborate forms of verse--perhaps
9534,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,rude precursors of the iambic and lyric metres--must also have been in
9535,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"popular use for ages in ballads, songs and hymns. We may infer then"
9536,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,that what Hesiod did was to turn to popular use the form of poetry
9537,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,which represented the highest standard of art in his day.
9538,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9539,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,But what were the conditions which produced this elaborate and highly
9540,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,artificial type of poetry? The characteristics of Homeric poetry
9541,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,enumerated above are conclusive evidence that it was not of popular
9542,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,origin. Some of them are extremely difficult to account for unless its
9543,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,true home was in the king's courts. It may be objected that Hesiod was
9544,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"familiar with Homeric poetry, though he knew nothing of court life."
9545,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"But Hesiod probably belonged to the last days of the kingly period,"
9546,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,when that institution was losing its power and popularity. It is only
9547,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,in accordance with what we might expect that in such an age court
9548,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,poets--in view of Theog. 94 f. we should perhaps say minstrels--would
9549,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,frequently try to get a hearing from a wider circle. Hesiod's own
9550,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,activity falls in with this explanation perfectly well. His popularity
9551,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,was due to the fact that he preserved the artistic form of court
9552,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"poetry, while at the same time he discarded its conventions and turned"
9553,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,to subjects which were more in accordance with the tastes and interests
9554,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,of his own class.
9555,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9556,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Apart from the courts it is difficult to see where conditions
9557,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,favourable to the growth of Homeric poetry could have existed. Aeolis
9558,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,in the eighth century must have differed very greatly from the city
9559,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,states of the sixth and fifth centuries. Hesiod himself belonged
9560,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,to a family which was possessed of some property. His father was a
9561,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,merchant; but we can hardly suppose that this class was either numerous
9562,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"or wealthy, in a land which consisted essentially of agricultural"
9563,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"communities. We shall hardly go astray, I think, in believing that the"
9564,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,conditions here at the time of which we are speaking bore far more
9565,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,resemblance to those which prevailed in Teutonic kingdoms some twelve
9566,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,or thirteen centuries later than to those of cities like Miletos or
9567,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Athens at their prime. There as here the wealth was probably to a large
9568,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,extent in the possession of the kings. Indeed from the story of Midas'
9569,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,relations with Agamemnon of Cyme (cf. p. 227) we may perhaps infer that
9570,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the kings retained a certain amount of influence even in the latter
9571,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,part of the eighth century. On the other hand the name of this king
9572,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,may certainly be taken as evidence that the courts were interested in
9573,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,heroic poetry[361].
9574,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9575,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,We have now seen that Homeric poetry goes back to the age of
9576,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"kingship and that it is not of popular origin (Stage III), but in"
9577,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,all probability a product of court life. Our next object must be
9578,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,to consider whether this poetry was a direct continuation of the
9579,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"court-minstrelsy of the Heroic Age (Stage I), represented by Demodocos"
9580,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,and Phemios--in which case of course it will correspond to Stage II of
9581,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,our scheme--or whether it is rather a secondary outgrowth from popular
9582,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"poetry (Stage IV). The problem, it will be seen, is essentially one of"
9583,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"stratification. If we may, in archaeological language, speak of the"
9584,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Homeric poems as a 'palace-structure'--it ought surely to be possible
9585,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,to determine whether traces of a 'village settlement' lie immediately
9586,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,beneath it.
9587,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9588,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,It has been pointed out above (p. 224 f.) that the Nibelungenlied
9589,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,cannot furnish any true analogy to the history of Homeric poetry. The
9590,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,other type of Stage IV which we have considered (p. 99 f.) is that of
9591,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the Edda poems. But I do not think that anyone will seriously expect
9592,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,to find a strict parallel here. In that case we should have to suppose
9593,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"that heroic poetry was originally unknown to the Aeolians, whether in"
9594,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Asia or Thessaly. But the Thessalian element--including as it does such
9595,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,striking conceptions as the location of the gods on Mount Olympos--is
9596,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,too deeply engrained in this class of poetry to render such a
9597,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,hypothesis probable. We shall see shortly that a better analogy for the
9598,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,history of the Edda poems is perhaps to be found in quite a different
9599,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,quarter.
9600,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9601,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,The theory which obtains most currency at the present time is that
9602,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Homeric poetry grew up in the Greek settlements on the Asiatic coast
9603,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,on the basis of ballads derived from Thessaly--perhaps also from other
9604,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,parts of Greece. This theory does not exactly answer to our definition
9605,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"of Stage IV; but we may treat it under the same heading, as it likewise"
9606,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,involves the development of heroic poetry out of popular poetry.
9607,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,According to any explanation of this kind we must of course assume that
9608,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the court-minstrelsy depicted in the poems is a reflection of court
9609,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"life in the Asiatic settlements. This is conceivable enough in itself,"
9610,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,provided that the requisite conditions are carried back at least to
9611,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"the ninth century. But is the theory probable? No one will suggest, I"
9612,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"suppose, that the wealth or culture of the Aeolic settlements during"
9613,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the tenth and ninth centuries was superior to that of the Greek
9614,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,kingdoms in general towards the close of the Achaean period. Briefly
9615,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,stated then the current theory comes to this: the wealthier and more
9616,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"cultured period produced nothing but popular ballads, while the poorer"
9617,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,and ruder period produced a most elaborate and magnificent court poetry.
9618,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9619,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,We have seen that Homeric poetry possesses certain characteristics
9620,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,which are incompatible with the idea that it is itself of popular
9621,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,origin. But a closer inspection will show that some of these
9622,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,characteristics are almost as difficult to account for on the
9623,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,hypothesis that it was a recent outgrowth from popular poetry. In
9624,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"particular this is true of their metrical form, if we are justified"
9625,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,in believing that the Homeric type of verse presupposes a long
9626,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"artistic development. Again, the confusion of different stories which"
9627,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,characterises popular poetry (Stage III) will not be removed in its
9628,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,more cultivated successor (Stage IV); Dietrich von Bern (Theodric)
9629,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,remains by the side of Etzel (Attila) in the Nibelungenlied. The same
9630,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,remark too applies to those changes of character which popular poetry
9631,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,is apt to produce. In the Nibelungenlied Hagen remains as cruel and
9632,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Kriemhild as passionately vindictive as popular fancy had painted
9633,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,them. The poets of a later age will not trouble themselves to save the
9634,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,characters of persons who lived long ago. We shall see shortly that
9635,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,this is true of Greek poetry just as much as of German. But the Homeric
9636,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,poems--except perhaps in the Nekyia--will not supply us with examples.
9637,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9638,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"Finally, we must bear in mind those reminiscences of Mycenean--or"
9639,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,rather 'sub-Mycenean'--splendour which the poems contain and their
9640,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,almost invariable use of bronze as the material for weapons--not to
9641,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,mention the fact that the political and national boundaries which they
9642,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,record are totally different from those which existed in the ninth
9643,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,century. Will anyone seriously maintain that such traditions could be
9644,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,preserved through the medium of popular ballads alone? I confess that
9645,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,such a hypothesis is altogether incredible to me.
9646,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9647,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"Now let us take the alternative explanation, suggested by the"
9648,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Anglo-Saxon poems. It is generally agreed that the Aeolic settlements
9649,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,are older than the Ionic in Asia; but since even the former are ignored
9650,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,in the poems it is hardly probable that they came into existence
9651,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,until towards the close of the Achaean period. When the storms broke
9652,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"upon Greece crowds of refugees, not only from Thessaly but also from"
9653,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"many other parts of the country, fled to the new Aeolic settlements"
9654,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"across the Aegean. Among them, according to the suggested analogy,"
9655,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"were many court minstrels, of the type represented by Demodocos and"
9656,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"Phemios, who brought with them not only a poetic technique matured"
9657,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"by long experience but also a number of poems, of which the newest"
9658,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,would probably be the most in favour. This poetry was developed
9659,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,and expanded by the court minstrels of subsequent generations;
9660,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,but the subject-matter became stereotyped and--precisely as in
9661,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,England--everything relating to the new settlements was completely
9662,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,ignored. This is the conclusion to which all the evidence at our
9663,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,disposal seems to me to point.

9666,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9667,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,We must now turn for a moment to the Cyclic poems. And here it is to be
9668,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"remembered in the first place that our information is very defective,"
9669,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,if not actually misleading. Herodotus (II 117) doubted Homer's
9670,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,authorship of the Cypria on the ground that it contained a statement
9671,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"in direct contradiction with the Iliad, namely that Alexandros arrived"
9672,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"at Troy with Helen on the third day after leaving Sparta, whereas it"
9673,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,is stated in the Iliad (VI 290 ff.) that he wandered out of his course
9674,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,(to Sidon) when he brought her. But the epitome of the Cypria which has
9675,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,come down to us states expressly that Alexandros did go to Sidon. Hence
9676,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,we can only conclude that its trustworthiness as an authority for the
9677,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,contents of the poem is open to serious doubt.
9678,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9679,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Taking the evidence as it stands we can detect at once an important
9680,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,difference between the Cypria and the Nostoi on the one hand and the
9681,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Iliad and the Odyssey on the other. In the two former poems the action
9682,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"seems to have been spread over a considerable number of years, while"
9683,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"in the latter it was limited to a few days or weeks. Again, as far as"
9684,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"we can judge, the two former treated a much larger number of events,"
9685,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,in proportion to their length--events too which were not so closely
9686,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,connected with one another. Indeed they seem to have been almost in
9687,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the nature of chronicles. These however are characteristics of popular
9688,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,rather than court poetry.
9689,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9690,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"The story of the Cypria, as we know it, bears a curious resemblance"
9691,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,to the Edda trilogy Reginsmál--Fáfnismál--Sigrdrífumál (cf. p. 13).
9692,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Both the Cyclic poem and the trilogy served as introductions to famous
9693,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,stories. Both stories were essentially concerned with the adventures
9694,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,and passions of human beings; but in both cases the introduction begins
9695,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"with the gods, and the origin of the tragic events which follow is"
9696,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"traced ultimately to irresponsible, not to say mischievous, conduct"
9697,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,on the part of certain deities. There can be no doubt that the whole
9698,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"theme of the Northern poems is a late addition to the story of Sigurðr,"
9699,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,and that the poems themselves were composed as an introduction to this
9700,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,story. Is it not possible that the Cypria was of somewhat similar
9701,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"origin? The latter part of the poem, if we are to trust the epitome,"
9702,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,contained some extraordinary features. The story of Odysseus' pretended
9703,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,madness and how he was eventually compelled to join the expedition is
9704,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"difficult to reconcile with the general tone of Homeric poetry. Again,"
9705,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the army is represented as assembling twice at Aulis and twice starting
9706,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,for Troy. The account of the first of these incidents agrees with what
9707,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"is stated in the Iliad (II 303 ff.), while the second contains the"
9708,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"story of the sacrifice of Iphigeneia, according to the version in which"
9709,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,she was rescued by Artemis. On the other hand it is worth bearing in
9710,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,mind that the poem is said to have ended with a catalogue of the Trojan
9711,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"allies, presumably the same list which we find in the Iliad (II 816"
9712,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"ff., or perhaps 840 ff.)--and this can hardly be regarded as a late"
9713,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,composition.
9714,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9715,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,The chief characteristic of the Nostoi seems to have been absence of
9716,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"unity. Beginning with the departure of the Achaeans from Troy, it"
9717,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,narrated the adventures which befell various heroes on their return.
9718,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"These formed, as far as we can tell, a number of quite distinct"
9719,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"stories, unconnected with one another except at the beginning. If we"
9720,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,may judge from the number of books contained in the poem--five as
9721,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"against eleven in the Cypria--these stories must have been very short,"
9722,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,and consequently it is perhaps questionable whether we are justified
9723,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"in regarding the Nostoi as an epic at all, except in the same sense"
9724,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,in which that term is applied to Hesiodic poetry. Indeed it seems to
9725,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,have had an affinity with the latter in more than one respect; for
9726,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the stories of the various heroes were probably not uninfluenced by
9727,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,genealogical interests. In the same light we may perhaps regard the
9728,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,fact that one scene is laid in an Ionic city (Colophon). All these
9729,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,features suggest that the poem came into existence at a fairly late
9730,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,period. If the Cypria was designed as an introduction to the story
9731,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,of the siege of Troy there can be little doubt that the Nostoi was
9732,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,composed as an epilogue to the same. On the other hand many scholars
9733,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,hold that it has been used by the Odyssey. But it is at least
9734,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,questionable whether the references in question do not come from the
9735,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,sources of the poem rather than the work itself[362].
9736,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9737,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"The other poems of the Trojan series--the Aithiopis, Little Iliad and"
9738,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Iliu Persis--resembled the Cypria and the Nostoi in the fact that
9739,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,they dealt with a considerable number of separate episodes[363]. But
9740,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the resemblance was perhaps only superficial; for these episodes were
9741,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,apparently represented as following one another in regular sequence. If
9742,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,we had only a fragmentary epitome of the Iliad we might gather from it
9743,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"much the same impression. All these poems were on a small scale, eleven"
9744,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"books in all; but, unlike the Cypria and the Nostoi, the action covered"
9745,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,only a short interval of time. Several incidents which they related
9746,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,are referred to or even told at length in the Odyssey; but we have not
9747,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,sufficient information to enable us to determine whether the references
9748,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,are taken from the poems themselves. The chief argument to the contrary
9749,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,is that these poems seem to have contained certain 'post-Homeric'
9750,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"features, notably the rite of purification from bloodshed, in the"
9751,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"Aithiopis, and the sacrifice of a virgin (Polyxene), in the Iliu"
9752,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"Persis. The former case is especially significant, because--in"
9753,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,striking contrast with the spirit of later Greek poetry--the ideas of
9754,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,pollution and purification seem to be entirely ignored in the Iliad and
9755,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Odyssey[364].
9756,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9757,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,These so-called post-Homeric features are of course really
9758,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"characteristics of a more primitive religion, and it would be better to"
9759,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,describe them as 'non-Homeric' or 'non-heroic.' But the fact that such
9760,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"practices are ignored in the Iliad and Odyssey, while later poets had"
9761,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"a special affection for them, renders it probable that their presence"
9762,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,in the Cyclic poems is due to popular influence. Are we then justified
9763,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,in assigning these poems to Stage IV of our scheme? That is a question
9764,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"which, considering the evidence at our disposal, I feel a good deal of"
9765,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,hesitation in answering. Certainly they cannot have differed from the
9766,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Iliad and Odyssey in anything like the same degree that the medieval
9767,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,German poems or even the heroic poems of the Edda differ from Beowulf.
9768,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,They may actually have incorporated a good deal of ancient matter. On
9769,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the whole the balance of probability seems to me to incline towards the
9770,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,view that the Cyclic poems are derived ultimately from the same body of
9771,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,early heroic court poetry upon which the Iliad and Odyssey themselves
9772,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"are based; but that their composition took place in later times, when"
9773,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the 'Homeric' standard was no longer preserved in its purity.
9774,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9775,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Whatever may be the case with the Cyclic poems there are other poetic
9776,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,works which may be assigned to Stage IV without hesitation. For our
9777,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,purpose it will perhaps be best to take an illustration from the drama;
9778,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"for, though such works are only secondary authorities, they are on the"
9779,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,whole less open to objection than lost poems on which our information
9780,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"may be misleading. A good example is furnished by Aeschylus' Oresteia,"
9781,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,a series of plays which deals with a subject treated at some length in
9782,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the Odyssey. The chief incidents are the murder of Agamemnon by his
9783,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"wife Clytaimnestra, the vengeance taken upon her by her son Orestes,"
9784,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"the persecution of the matricide by the Erinyes, his purification"
9785,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"by Apollo, and his trial by Athene and the citizens of Athens. In"
9786,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"the Odyssey the first of these incidents, the murder, is ascribed"
9787,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"to Aigisthos, Clytaimnestra's paramour. As regards the second we"
9788,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,have nothing but a passing reference to Clytaimnestra's funeral. The
9789,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"other incidents are not mentioned at all. Again, in Aeschylus' work"
9790,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,prominence is given to an attempt on Clytaimnestra's part to placate
9791,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"the dead Agamemnon, to an invocation of him for vengeance by his"
9792,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"children, and to the instigation of the Erinyes by Clytaimnestra's"
9793,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,ghost. These features too are unknown in the Odyssey; indeed they are
9794,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,directly opposed to all that we know of Homeric religion. Then again
9795,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,we find frequent and detailed allusions to tragic events which had
9796,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,occurred previously in the history of Agamemnon's family--especially
9797,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the 'banquet of Thyestes' and the sacrifice of Iphigeneia. On these
9798,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,matters too both the Iliad and the Odyssey are completely silent. Yet
9799,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,in the latter case this silence cannot be due to accident. Either the
9800,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"poets were ignorant of the story, or they deliberately suppressed it."
9801,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9802,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Few modern readers can fail to appreciate the Oresteia as an almost
9803,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"unrivalled masterpiece of poetic art, in spite of the fact that the"
9804,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,ideas with which it is permeated are largely strange and unreal to us.
9805,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,But what would have been the effect if such a work had been recited at
9806,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,one of those courts in which Homeric poetry was patronised in early
9807,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"times? There can scarcely be any doubt, I think, that the recitation"
9808,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,would not have been tolerated. To such an audience the poet's religious
9809,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"conceptions would have been intelligible enough, but only as products"
9810,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"of a degraded and baneful superstition, while his skilful presentation"
9811,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,of various painful incidents in the history of a royal house--the most
9812,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,distinguished in Greece--would have appeared not merely an offence
9813,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,against good manners but rather a wanton insult to the kingly class in
9814,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,general.
9815,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9816,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,The social conditions and the ethical standard of Aeschylus' time
9817,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,differed no doubt very greatly from those of the Homeric age. This is a
9818,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,subject with which we shall have to deal later. It should be observed
9819,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,however that nearly all the special features which characterise
9820,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Aeschylus' treatment of this story can be paralleled from Scandinavian
9821,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,works which we may assign to Stage IV. A very close analogy for the
9822,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"'banquet of Thyestes' is furnished by the story of Guðrún, Atli and"
9823,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"their children; and it is to be remembered that, though Atli at least"
9824,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"was a historical character, this story cannot possibly have any"
9825,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,foundation in fact. The persecution of Orestes by the Erinyes may
9826,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,be compared with Saxo's story (p. 246) of the curse inflicted upon
9827,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"Haldanus[365], likewise as a result of the shedding of 'kindred blood.'"
9828,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,With the sacrifice of Iphigeneia we may compare that of Vikarr in
9829,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"Gautreks Saga (cap. 7), which was also brought about by the prevalence"
9830,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,of contrary winds. Invocation of the dead is not uncommon in such
9831,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,works. On the other hand it is extremely doubtful whether any of those
9832,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,features would have been permissible in early heroic poetry. They do
9833,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,not occur in the extant poems of Stage II.
9834,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9835,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,There is sufficient evidence that most of the characteristic features
9836,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"of Aeschylus' story were not invented by him, though as to his sources"
9837,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,our information is not very satisfactory. The lost Oresteia of
9838,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"Stesichoros was doubtless one of his chief authorities, and there is"
9839,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,some reason for believing that the version given in this work differed
9840,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,from the Homeric account quite as much as that of Aeschylus. Beyond
9841,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"Stesichoros we may perhaps think of the Cyclic poems, especially the"
9842,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Nostoi; but it is very doubtful if they would have furnished such a
9843,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,very markedly divergent form of the story. Stesichoros himself is said
9844,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,to have treated his authorities with great freedom. But some of the
9845,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,non-Homeric features can hardly be due to deliberate alteration. We
9846,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,may notice especially the differences in the personal relations of
9847,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Agamemnon's family. In the Iliad he is the son of Atreus; Stesichoros
9848,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,and others call him son of Pleisthenes. In the Iliad he has three
9849,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"daughters, Laodice, Chrysothemis and Iphianassa; Aeschylus gives him"
9850,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"two, Electra and Iphigeneia, the latter of whom seems to have figured"
9851,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,also in the Cypria[366]. There is also a good deal of discrepancy in
9852,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,regard to the scene of the events. In the Iliad and Odyssey Agamemnon
9853,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,belongs to Mycenae; in Aeschylus' account this place is forgotten
9854,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"and the story transferred to Argos, while Pindar, apparently also"
9855,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"Stesichoros and Simonides[367], placed it at Amyclai (close to Sparta)."
9856,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Now these are just the kind of corruptions and discrepancies which
9857,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,characterise popular poetry everywhere. Taken together with the other
9858,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,non-Homeric features discussed above they seem to me to afford ground
9859,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,for suspecting that Stesichoros and his followers drew upon a popular
9860,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,and perhaps Doric or Peloponnesian version of the story[368] which was
9861,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,independent of Homeric poetry. Their work then would be similar in more
9862,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,than one respect to that of those Norse poets who rehabilitated the
9863,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,old story of Sigurðr and Guðrún after the (strophic) type of their own
9864,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,national poetry.
9865,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9866,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,*       *       *       *       *
9867,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9868,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,The course of our discussion has led us to conclude that the Homeric
9869,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,poems are products of court poetry or minstrelsy in direct continuation
9870,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,of that type of minstrelsy which we considered at the beginning of the
9871,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,chapter. As yet however we have expressed no definite opinion as to the
9872,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"length of time involved in their development, although we have noticed"
9873,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,that the evidence commonly adduced in favour of a long interval between
9874,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the earliest and latest portions of the poems is highly unsatisfactory.
9875,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,It must be admitted that beyond a certain point the evidence at
9876,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,our disposal does not admit of anything more than an estimation of
9877,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,probability.
9878,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9879,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,We have seen that there is good reason for believing that the history
9880,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,of heroic poetry in Aeolis and in England proceeded on similar lines
9881,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"in several respects, and also that the chief monument of English"
9882,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,heroic poetry was probably composed within not much more than a
9883,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,century after certain events which it records. Now in any comparison
9884,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,between English and Greek heroic poetry we must of course leave out
9885,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,of account the frequent Christian allusions which occur in the former
9886,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,(cf. p. 47 ff.); for there is no reason whatever for supposing that
9887,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,any change comparable with the introduction of Christianity came over
9888,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the Greek world during the times which saw the development of Homeric
9889,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,poetry. Apart from this element anachronisms are not very numerous or
9890,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,marked; but they do occur. Thus the road which leads to the Danish
9891,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"king's dwelling is described as a Roman road (_straet_), paved with"
9892,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"stone (Beow. 320), while the members of the same king's court (_ib._"
9893,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,768) are termed 'inhabitants of a chester' (_ceasterbuendum_). Such
9894,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,cases may be compared with the Homeric inconsistencies discussed in
9895,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the last chapter--e.g. perhaps the occasional use of iron for weapons.
9896,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"It can hardly be maintained, I think, that the latter are of greater"
9897,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,significance than the anachronisms in English heroic poetry.
9898,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9899,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,This absence of striking anachronisms decidedly favours the view that
9900,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the period involved in the development of Homeric poetry was not very
9901,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,long. Against such a conclusion it may of course be urged that there is
9902,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,a constantly recurring phrase (οἷοι νῦν βροτοί εἰσι) which contrasts
9903,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"the 'men of the present day,' i.e. the men of the poet's own time, with"
9904,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"the heroes of the siege of Troy, emphasizing the superior strength"
9905,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,of the latter. But it is quite unnecessary to suppose that a long
9906,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,interval of time is intended here. The old Nestor uses almost the same
9907,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"expression in Il. I 272 (τῶν οἳ νῦν βροτοί εἰσιν ἐπιχθόνιοι), when he"
9908,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,compares the men among whom he was then living with those he had known
9909,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"in his youth. Again, in Od. VIII 122 f., Odysseus contrasts the 'men of"
9910,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the present day' (ὅσσοι νῦν βροτοί εἰσιν ἐπὶ χθονὶ) with the 'men of
9911,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,old' (ἀνδράσι προτέροισιν); but by the latter phrase he means persons
9912,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,belonging to the generation next above his own (Heracles and Eurytos).
9913,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,The same usage occurs elsewhere. Thus in Il. IX 524 Phoinix speaks of
9914,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the 'glories of those heroes that were of old' (τῶν πρόσθεν ἐπευθόμεθα
9915,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,κλέα ἀνδρῶν ἡρώων); but the story which he proceeds to relate is of
9916,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"Meleagros, the uncle of Diomedes. Indeed persons of more than two"
9917,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,generations back are seldom mentioned in the Homeric poems.
9918,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9919,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,An expression very similar to the one last quoted is used by Hesiod
9920,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"(Theog. 99 ff.) when he speaks of the minstrel as singing the ""glories"
9921,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"of men of old and the blessed gods who hold Olympos[369]."" Here of"
9922,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"course the reference is not to persons of the last generation, but to"
9923,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"the heroes of Homeric poetry. In the Works and Days, vv. 156 ff., 174"
9924,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"ff., the Heroic Age is distinguished with all possible clearness from"
9925,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the period in which the poet himself lived. It is not to be overlooked
9926,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,that antiquarian interest forms a prominent feature in all Hesiodic
9927,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"poetry. Even in the Works and Days it is obvious enough, although"
9928,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,such topics have little in common with the main theme of the poem. In
9929,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"the Catalogue we meet with such characters as Hellen and Doros, who"
9930,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,owe their existence to speculations in tribal origins. The poetry of
9931,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the following period seems to have been essentially of a genealogical
9932,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,character.
9933,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9934,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"For such antiquarian interest the Homeric poems furnish no evidence,"
9935,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,except perhaps in the Nekyia. Not only are the genealogies of the
9936,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"heroes seldom carried back more than two generations, but--what is more"
9937,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"important--there is scarcely any reference to their descendants, beyond"
9938,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"the first generation. Again, Achilles is said to have been singing the"
9939,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,'glories of heroes' (κλέα ἀνδρῶν) when he received the embassy (Il.
9940,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,IX 189); but it is not stated that these were heroes of former times.
9941,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,The songs of Demodocos and Phemios deal with the adventures of the
9942,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Achaeans at Troy and on their return home. That this is no accident is
9943,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"shown by Od. I 351 f., where Telemachos pleads in excuse for Phemios"
9944,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"that ""men always prize that song the most which rings newest in their"
9945,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"ears."" No sentiment could well be more foreign to the tone of Hesiodic"
9946,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,or post-Hesiodic poetry than this. If any poet of that school had
9947,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,interested himself in contemporary history our knowledge of the eighth
9948,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,century would not be the blank which unfortunately it is. Clearly the
9949,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,only heroic poetry known to them was the κλέεα προτέρων ἀνθρώπων. That
9950,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,means very much the same thing as Einhard's _ueterum regum actus et
9951,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,bella_ or the _antiquorum actus regumque certamina_ sung by Bernlef
9952,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"(cf. pp. 80, 87). At such a time if anyone was composing a heroic poem"
9953,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,it would probably have seemed natural enough to use the formulae with
9954,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"which several of the Edda poems begin: ""It was long ago,"" or ""It was in"
9955,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"early times that,"" etc. On the other hand Telemachos' remark would be"
9956,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,perfectly appropriate in the earlier stages of Teutonic poetry. We have
9957,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,seen (p. 85) that in Beowulf one of the Danish king's knights begins to
9958,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,compose a poem on the hero's adventure within a few hours of the event.
9959,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Procopius' account of Hermegisklos and Radiger (p. 97 ff.) must also be
9960,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,"borne in mind, although this story may not have attained the form of an"
9961,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,epic poem.
9962,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,
9963,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,The conclusion then to which the Teutonic evidence leads us is that at
9964,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,all events the type of narrative was fixed very early. The growth of
9965,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,the Homeric poems may or may not have taken longer than that of their
9966,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,Teutonic counterparts. Records of the eighth century B.C. speak of
9967,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,κλέεα προτέρων ἀνθρώπων; records of the eighth century A.D. speak of
9968,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,_antiquorum actus_. But in neither case do the poems themselves give
9969,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,expression to a consciousness of the antiquity of the events which they
9970,EARLY GREEK POETRY AND MINSTRELSY.,relate.

10049,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,
10050,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,
10051,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,In the last chapter we have endeavoured to estimate in general terms
10052,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,the position of the Homeric poems relatively to the poetry of the
10053,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,Heroic Age itself on the one hand and to Hesiod and genealogical poetry
10054,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,on the other. I have avoided entering into details in regard to the
10055,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,relationship between the extant poems and the lost Cyclic poems because
10056,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"I did not wish to load the discussion with matter which, owing to the"
10057,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"fragmentary nature of the evidence, must largely be of a hypothetical"
10058,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,character. At the same time I am inclined to think that the Trojan
10059,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,Catalogue (Il. II 816 ff.) does contain some indications which may
10060,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,permit the date of its composition to be determined with a fair amount
10061,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,of probability.
10062,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,
10063,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,According to Proclus' Chrestomathy[370] the Cypria contained
10064,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"(apparently at the end) a κατάλογος τῶν τοῖς Τρωσὶ συμμαχησάντων,"
10065,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,and it is commonly believed[371] that this is the list which has
10066,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"been incorporated in our text of the Iliad. Proclus' words, taken"
10067,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"literally, would seem to indicate that the list did not include the"
10068,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"Trojans themselves. The 'allies' proper begin perhaps at v. 840, and"
10069,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,consequently it has been held that vv. 816-839 are a later addition.
10070,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"Considering the nature of the evidence, this view can scarcely be"
10071,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,regarded as beyond question. But there certainly are noticeable
10072,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"differences between the first and second portions of the list, apart"
10073,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,from the fact that the former contains no national names except Τρῶες
10074,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,and Δαρδάνιοι. The first part is much more dependent on the Iliad than
10075,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,is the second. Thus all the personal names which occur in it are to
10076,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"be found in other parts of the poem, while several passages (eight"
10077,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,verses[372] out of the twenty-four) have been borrowed practically
10078,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"verbatim. On the other hand, out of the twenty-five persons mentioned"
10079,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,in the second part of the list eleven are not met with elsewhere in the
10080,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"Iliad, while four of the others are not elsewhere associated with the"
10081,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"nations (Mysians, Phrygians and Meiones) to which they belong here."
10082,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"Again, though several verses show acquaintance with other passages in"
10083,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"the Iliad, there is apparently no single verse which has been borrowed"
10084,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,entire. The most striking fact however is that in two cases we have
10085,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,references to heroes who are said to have been slain by Achilles in
10086,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,the river. Neither of these persons is mentioned in the account of the
10087,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,river fight given in the Iliad. In explanation of this it has been
10088,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,suggested that another scene of this kind occurred in the Aithiopis;
10089,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"but we have no evidence to this effect, and it is surely at least as"
10090,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,probable that they are derived from a different version of the river
10091,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,fight described in the Iliad.
10092,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,
10093,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,In both parts of the list we meet with a considerable number of
10094,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"geographical names--of cities, rivers and mountains--many of which"
10095,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,(five in the first part and twelve in the second) do not occur
10096,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,elsewhere in the Iliad. The majority of the names mentioned belong to
10097,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"the immediate neighbourhood of the coast, and it is a fact worth noting"
10098,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"that these almost all fall into three distinct groups--in Paphlagonia,"
10099,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,the Troad and Caria respectively. There is a great gap covering
10100,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,apparently the whole of the Bithynian coast and another embracing the
10101,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,coast of the Aegean from Troy itself to Mycale. In explanation of this
10102,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,fact it has been suggested[373] that the names in the coast-districts
10103,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,are derived from an early poem or poems on the voyage of the Argo. This
10104,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,hypothesis might certainly account for the mention of the Paphlagonian
10105,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,names in v. 852 ff. But they are the only names in the second part of
10106,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,the list for which it gives any explanation; for the suggestion that
10107,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,the references to the Carian localities in v. 868 f. are connected
10108,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,in any way with the story of the Argo can hardly be taken seriously.
10109,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"Hence, if we are to trust the hypothesis in any form, it is more"
10110,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,probable that v. 853 ff. are a subsequent addition to the list. But
10111,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,even in the first part the evidence in its favour is of the most
10112,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,slender description[374]. Of the thirteen place-names which occur
10113,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,in this section eight are found elsewhere in the Iliad; of the rest
10114,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,only two apparently are mentioned in the accounts of the voyage of
10115,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,the Argo which have come down to us. What is more important however
10116,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,is that these accounts do mention a considerable number of Bithynian
10117,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"localities[375], both on the coast of the Sea of Marmara and on that"
10118,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"of the Black Sea, as well as several peoples who do not appear in"
10119,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,the Catalogue. We must conclude then that this hypothesis in no way
10120,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,accounts for the peculiarities of the Catalogue.
10121,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,
10122,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,The true explanation is not far to seek. It was well known to the
10123,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,ancients that the Bithynians were an intrusive Thracian people who
10124,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"had crossed over from Europe. Again, the Aegean coast, at all events"
10125,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"from the Gulf of Adramyttion southwards[376], was covered with Aeolic"
10126,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,and Ionic settlements. Greek tradition unanimously held that these
10127,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"settlements were planted subsequently to the Trojan War, and we have"
10128,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,no reason for supposing that the author of the Catalogue thought
10129,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,differently. At the same time we may infer from his silence that he did
10130,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,not claim to know what peoples had occupied these regions previously.
10131,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,On the other hand he did claim such knowledge of the previous
10132,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,occupants not only of the Troad but also of the Carian coast.
10133,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,
10134,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,This fact surely furnishes the means of dating the composition of the
10135,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,Catalogue with a fair amount of probability. It is generally agreed
10136,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,that the Ionic settlements were later than the Aeolic; but probably
10137,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,no one will contend that the Greek occupation of Miletos and Mycale
10138,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,began appreciably later than the end of the tenth century. It is not
10139,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,necessary of course to suppose that these places were still in Carian
10140,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,hands when the Catalogue was composed. But at the same time the memory
10141,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,of their former possessors is not likely to have been perpetuated in
10142,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,an incidental reference like this much more than a century after they
10143,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,became Greek settlements. The more northern part of the list contains
10144,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,at all events nothing incompatible with the view that it was drawn
10145,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,up in the first half of the eighth century. The excavations in the
10146,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,Troad have certainly brought to light the fact that that district was
10147,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,overrun by barbarians. But there is nothing to show that this took
10148,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"place at the time of the Bithynian invasion, whether the two movements"
10149,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,were connected in any way or not. The evidence on the whole seems to
10150,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,indicate that the barbarian occupation occurred not very long before
10151,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,the foundation of the Ionic colonies on the Hellespont. There is
10152,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,nothing very remarkable in the fact that the places mentioned in the
10153,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,Catalogue lie chiefly on the coast; for such places would naturally be
10154,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"the most familiar to the Asiatic Greeks, who must have been a seafaring"
10155,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,people to some extent from the beginning.
10156,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,
10157,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,Now in other parts of the Iliad we find mention of several peoples
10158,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,which apparently occupied the districts left blank in the Catalogue.
10159,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"Thus in X 429, XX 329 we hear of the Caucones, who seem to have"
10160,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"belonged to Bithynia[377]. In XXI 86 f., VI 396 f. (cf. II 691, etc.)"
10161,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"we meet with peoples called Leleges and Cilices, the positions of which"
10162,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,are quite definitely stated. The former are said to have dwelt in the
10163,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"valley of the Satnioeis, in the south of the Troad, the latter somewhat"
10164,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"further to the east, about the Gulf of Adramyttion. Again, in Od. XI"
10165,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"519 ff. we hear of a certain Eurypylos the son of Telephos, chief of"
10166,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,the Ceteioi. Telephos and his son figured in the Cypria and the Little
10167,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,Iliad; and Greek tradition placed their home (Teuthrania) in the region
10168,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,between the Gulf of Adramyttion and the Hermos. The name Κήτειοι has
10169,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,been connected with that of the Hittites (Kheta); but without going
10170,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,into this question we may probably follow Strabo (XIII 1. 70) in
10171,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"tracing a reminiscence of them in the name of a stream called Ceteios,"
10172,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,a tributary of the Caicos. The Catalogue contains no reference to any
10173,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"of these peoples, presumably because their names were not familiar"
10174,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"to the author. In later times we hear no more of the Ceteioi, while"
10175,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,Cilices are found only in Cilicia. The Leleges indeed are mentioned
10176,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"frequently and on both sides of the Aegean, but only as a people of the"
10177,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,past.
10178,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,
10179,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,It is an easy and popular method of interpretation to discredit
10180,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,evidence for which no obvious explanation is forthcoming; and following
10181,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,this method many scholars have regarded the names under discussion as
10182,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,phantoms. The point against which adverse criticism has chiefly been
10183,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,directed is the location of the Cilices in the Gulf of Adramyttion.
10184,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,It is to be remembered however that we have no evidence earlier than
10185,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,the seventh century for the presence of a people called Cilices in
10186,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,the land which ultimately bore their name. In the eighth century this
10187,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,people apparently dwelt to the north of the Taurus. In earlier times
10188,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"we hear of them, so far as I am aware, only in the 'Poem of Pentaur,'"
10189,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,a work which celebrates the battle fought at Kadesh early in the
10190,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"thirteenth century, between Rameses II and the Hittites. It is there"
10191,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"stated that the ""chief of Kheta had come, having gathered together all"
10192,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"countries from the ends of the sea to the land of Kheta, which came"
10193,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"entire[378]."" In addition to a number of Syrian names which occur in"
10194,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,the accounts of earlier wars the poem contains a group of new names
10195,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"of peoples, consisting of _Pidasa_, _Dardenui_, _Masa_, _Kalakisha_"
10196,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"and _Luka_, with two others[379]. The last two of these names are"
10197,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"almost universally identified with the Cilices and Lycians, and the"
10198,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"first is usually connected with the name Πήδασος or Πήδασα, while many"
10199,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,scholars accept the identification of the second and third with the
10200,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,Dardanoi and Mysians respectively. If the names _Pidasa_ and Πήδασος
10201,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"are connected we are brought to the Aegean, where we find both Pedasos"
10202,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,on the Satnioeis and Pedasa[380] in Caria. Evidence to the same effect
10203,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,is furnished by the procession of ten warriors depicted on one of the
10204,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,monuments[381]. Of these five are of the Hittite type and two Semitic;
10205,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,but the other three are of Aegean physiognomy and wear different
10206,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,varieties of that feather head-dress which is known in Crete from much
10207,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,earlier times[382]. When we find that this earliest reference to the
10208,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"Cilices associates them with a group of peoples[383], of whom some"
10209,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"clearly belong to the west of Asia Minor, and some quite probably to"
10210,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"the north-west corner of the peninsula, it must be admitted that we"
10211,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,have no valid ground for discrediting the evidence of the Iliad as to
10212,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,their presence around the Gulf of Adramyttion.
10213,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,
10214,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,On the other hand it must not be overlooked that later authorities
10215,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,know nothing of Cilices in this region; neither do they mention Leleges
10216,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,in the south of the Troad or Ceteioi anywhere. If these peoples had
10217,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,survived the Aeolic invasion it is difficult to believe that they
10218,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,could have perished subsequently without leaving some trace of their
10219,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,existence in Greek tradition. The Pelasgoi of Larissa in the valley of
10220,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"the Hermos[384] appear to have been remembered in tradition, although"
10221,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,their territories were occupied by the Aeolians--probably at quite an
10222,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,early date. The presumption then is that the other peoples had already
10223,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,been destroyed by Greek raids--as is stated in the Iliad--or else that
10224,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,they had been expelled or absorbed by the surrounding nations before
10225,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,the Greek colonies were fully established. In either case we shall have
10226,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,to carry back the poetic traditions relating to them practically to the
10227,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,beginning of the first millennium.
10228,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,
10229,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,We have seen that it is difficult to date the composition of the Trojan
10230,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,Catalogue--at all events the latter part of it--after about the middle
10231,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,of the eighth century. I am not aware of any valid reason for denying
10232,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,that the Cypria as a whole may have been composed about this time or
10233,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,for supposing that the Catalogue ever existed independently. It is
10234,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,in the preceding period--presumably between the eleventh and eighth
10235,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"centuries--that we must place the composition of the Iliad, though"
10236,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,its form may not have been finally settled when the Cypria came into
10237,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,existence. Any more definite conclusion is rendered difficult by the
10238,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,unsatisfactory nature of our information regarding the Cypria. But
10239,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,the general impression conveyed by the epitome is that an appreciable
10240,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,portion of the poem was derived from incidental references in the
10241,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"Iliad, and that as a whole it possessed to a considerable degree the"
10242,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,characteristics of popular poetry. If this impression is correct we
10243,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,must conclude that heroic court-poetry was in its decadence when the
10244,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,Cypria was composed; and consequently we shall do well to place the
10245,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,"flourishing period, which produced the great epics, at least a century"
10246,NOTE VI. THE TROJAN CATALOGUE.,earlier.

10315,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10316,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10317,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,In Chapter VI we saw that the heroic poetry of the Teutonic peoples
10318,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,was very largely affected by folk-tales; that supernatural beings were
10319,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"frequently introduced, while ordinary human beings or animals were"
10320,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,credited with supernatural properties--in short that the distinction
10321,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,between natural and supernatural was not clearly drawn. We saw further
10322,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that these features were by no means confined to the later stages of
10323,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,heroic poetry--that on the contrary some of them were prominent even
10324,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"in the Anglo-Saxon poems, while the others appeared to be of equal"
10325,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,antiquity.
10326,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10327,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,The same phenomena appear in Greek heroic poetry. Mythical beings and
10328,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,features obviously derived from folk-tales figure quite as frequently
10329,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,as in the Teutonic poems. Their presence is often regarded as a proof
10330,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that the stories into which they enter and the persons with whom they
10331,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,are brought into contact are themselves products of myth or fiction.
10332,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,This is a question with which we shall have to deal in the following
10333,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,chapters. For the present it will be sufficient to quote what may be
10334,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,regarded as a typical expression of the attitude of more cautious
10335,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"scholars towards the problem of the story of Troy[385]: ""It is"
10336,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,fantastic to treat the siege of Troy as merely a solar myth--to explain
10337,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the abduction of Helen by Paris as the extinction of the sunlight in
10338,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the West, and Troy as the region of the dawn beset and possessed by the"
10339,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"sunrise. It is equally fantastic, and more illogical, to follow the"
10340,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"rationalising method--to deduct the supernatural element, and claim"
10341,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the whole residuum as historical fact. Homer says that Achilles slew
10342,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Hector with the aid of Athene. We are not entitled to omit Athene, and"
10343,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"still to affirm that Achilles slew Hector."""
10344,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10345,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,It may be observed that the gods are introduced in the Homeric poems in
10346,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,many different ways. The incident just cited--where Athene takes the
10347,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,form of Deiphobos (Il. XXII 226 ff.)--belongs to one of the commonest
10348,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"types, and one which requires comparatively little imagination, if we"
10349,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,are prepared to grant the existence of a belief that the gods were
10350,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,capable of disguising themselves in human form. Sometimes again deities
10351,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"render themselves visible only to certain individuals out of a crowd,"
10352,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"as in Il. I 194 ff., where Athene intervenes in order to stay Achilles"
10353,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,from drawing his sword upon Agamemnon. Another type is the disguise of
10354,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"gods as birds, as when we find Athene and Apollo sitting upon an oak in"
10355,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the form of vultures, before the combat of Hector and Aias (_ib._ VII"
10356,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,58 ff.). On other occasions birds are sent by a god as a sign of his
10357,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"favour or protection, as in Il. XXIV 315 ff. and many other passages."
10358,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Somewhat akin to this type is the dream sent by Zeus to Agamemnon in
10359,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Il. II 5 ff.
10360,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10361,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,It has been remarked that in such cases as these a sceptical person
10362,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,might have accounted for everything that passed without reference to
10363,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,any intervention on the part of a deity. But there are a number of
10364,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,other cases where the action is affected by gods in ways which could
10365,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,not be accounted for on any rationalistic hypothesis. We may refer to
10366,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Il. III 380 ff., where Aphrodite snatches Paris away from Menelaos and"
10367,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,conveys him to his own house in Troy. Or again to several passages in
10368,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the Diomedeia where deities show themselves almost or quite without
10369,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,disguise and even take an active part in the fighting. A still greater
10370,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,amount of imagination perhaps is required for the scenes which depict
10371,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the quarrels and amusements of the gods in Olympos, and their schemes"
10372,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,for helping or destroying the combatants. It has been held that all
10373,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,such passages as these belong to a later period than those of the less
10374,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,imaginative types described above.
10375,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10376,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"In Teutonic stories of the Heroic Age, as we have already seen, very"
10377,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,few notices relating to the gods have been preserved. The appearances
10378,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of Othin in Völsunga Saga (cf. p. 114) may be compared with those of
10379,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Apollo in the Iliad or Athene in the Odyssey; for his divinity is not
10380,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"recognised at once, though he does not take the form of a person known"
10381,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"to his favourites. Again, though I know no exact Homeric parallel"
10382,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"to the incident in Sigmundr's last battle, when the hero's sword is"
10383,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"shattered at the touch of Othin's javelin, the idea is in complete"
10384,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"harmony with several passages in the Diomedeia (e.g. V 129 ff., 438"
10385,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"ff., VI 128 ff., 306 f.). It is true that we do not know whether these"
10386,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,incidents in Völsunga Saga are based on old tradition or not. But a
10387,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,good parallel for the last of the Homeric types is furnished by the
10388,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Langobardic story of Wodan and Fria and the victory granted by them
10389,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to the Winniles (cf. p. 115). The similarity between this story and
10390,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the incident related of Zeus and Hera in Il. XIV 153-353 gives us
10391,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,some ground for suspecting that the heathen poetry of the Teutonic
10392,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Heroic Age may have possessed decided 'Homeric' characteristics in its
10393,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,treatment of the gods.
10394,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10395,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,As the case stands however we shall have to take our illustrations from
10396,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,stories of the Viking Age. A somewhat curious parallel to the incident
10397,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of Athene and Hector in Il. XXII 226 ff. is to be found in the story
10398,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"of Haraldr Hilditönn, as told in Saxo's History, pp. 255, 263. Haraldr"
10399,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"had a confidential servant named Bruno, whom he employed to drive his"
10400,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,chariot and to carry messages to his nephew Ringo (Sigurðr Hringr).
10401,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"This man eventually was drowned; but Othin took his place and form, and"
10402,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,exerted himself to sow discord between the two kings. It was not until
10403,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the battle at Bravalla had begun that Haraldr had any suspicion of the
10404,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,treachery which had been played upon him. Then suddenly recognising
10405,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the identity of his charioteer he begged him to grant him victory. But
10406,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Othin threw him out of the chariot and slew him.
10407,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10408,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"The story of Haraldr Hilditönn refers, it is true, to times for"
10409,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,which we have no historical records. But a still more graphic story
10410,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of intervention on the part of divine beings occurs in connection
10411,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,with a well-known event--the expedition made against Norway by the
10412,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Jómsvíkingar. In the latter part of the tenth century a number of
10413,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Scandinavian adventurers had established and fortified a settlement at
10414,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Jómsborg on the island of Wollin at the mouth of the Oder. About the
10415,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"year 994 their leaders, Sigvaldi and Búi, made a vow to attack Haakon,"
10416,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"earl of Lade, who then ruled Norway. The earl was taken by surprise"
10417,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,and had not been able to muster all his forces when he encountered the
10418,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"hostile fleet at Hiörungavágr, near the mouth of the Romsdal Fjord."
10419,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"The battle at first went against him; and, according to the story, he"
10420,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,took advantage of a respite in the fighting to retire to one of the
10421,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,islands and pray to Thórgerðr Hölgabrúðr. He was not able to obtain
10422,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,her assistance until he had sacrificed to her his youngest son. When
10423,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"he resumed the fight, the weather, which had been hot, underwent a"
10424,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,complete change. A snow-storm came from the north and beat in the
10425,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"faces of the pirates, so that they were numbed with the cold and could"
10426,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"neither move nor see. But worse was to come. ""It is said that Hávarðr,"
10427,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"one of Búi's companions, was the first to see Thórgerðr in Haakon's"
10428,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"fleet; but soon she was seen by many, both those who had second sight"
10429,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,and those who had not. When the snow abated a little they saw also
10430,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"that arrows were flying, as it seemed, from every one of the demon's"
10431,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"fingers, and each arrow brought about a man's death."" Then they tell"
10432,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Sigvaldi, who says: ""It seems to me that we have got to fight today not"
10433,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"against men, but against the worst of devils."" Still he continues the"
10434,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,fight. When Haakon saw that the snow was abating he cried with all his
10435,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"might to Thórgerðr and her sister Irpa, reminding them how much he had"
10436,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"given up to them in sacrificing his son. Then the storm began again,"
10437,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"and soon Hávarðr saw two female figures on Haakon's ship, both acting"
10438,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,as the one had done previously. Then Sigvaldi said that he would now
10439,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"take to flight and that all his men were to do likewise, for they had"
10440,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,made no vow to fight against devils[386].
10441,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10442,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Here also we may cite a story connected with another historical event,"
10443,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,which took place about ten years before the battle of Hiörungavágr.
10444,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Eric the Victorious, king of Sweden, expelled his nephew Styrbiörn from"
10445,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the kingdom; and the latter invaded the country with the help of the
10446,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Danish king Harold Blue-tooth. On the eve of the battle Eric went into
10447,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Othin's temple and in order to obtain victory promised to give himself
10448,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,up dead at the end of ten years. Soon afterwards he saw a big man
10449,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"with a long hood, who put a cane into his hand and told him to throw"
10450,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"it over Styrbiörn's army saying: ""You all belong to Othin."" When he"
10451,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,threw the cane it seemed to turn into a javelin and brought blindness
10452,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,upon Styrbiörn and all his host. On the same occasion Thor was seen
10453,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in Styrbiörn's camp[387]. Such cases are by no means isolated. Olafr
10454,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Tryggvason, who reigned over Norway from 995 to 1000, is said to have"
10455,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,been visited both by Othin and Thor[388].
10456,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10457,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Of dreams perhaps the most interesting case is a story told of an
10458,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Icelander named Glúmr, a contemporary of Earl Haakon of Lade. A"
10459,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,certain Thórkell possessed an estate which he was compelled to sell to
10460,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Glúmr. Before leaving he went to Frey's temple, sacrificed an ox and"
10461,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,prayed that Glúmr likewise might be forced to give up the estate. This
10462,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"actually came to pass. But before he left, Glúmr dreamed that he saw a"
10463,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"great crowd on the river banks coming to see Frey, who was seated on"
10464,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,a chair. In his dream he asked who they were. They replied that they
10465,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,were his departed relatives and that they were praying Frey that he
10466,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,(Glúmr) should not be driven from his estate. But it was of no use;
10467,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Frey answered curtly and angrily, remembering the ox which Thórkell had"
10468,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,given him[389].
10469,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10470,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,For the action of Homeric deities in sending birds as a mark of favour
10471,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,or omen of success a good parallel is to be found in another incident
10472,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in the life of Earl Haakon of Lade. When Jutland was invaded by the
10473,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Emperor Otto II in 974 Harold Blue-tooth summoned Haakon to his
10474,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,assistance. After the campaign the Danish king adopted Christianity
10475,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,and compelled Haakon to do likewise. But the latter set off with his
10476,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"fleet as soon as possible and, landing on the coast of Östergötland,"
10477,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,proceeded to offer a great sacrifice. Thereupon there came two ravens
10478,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,flying by and screaming loud. The earl interpreted this as a sign that
10479,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Othin had accepted the sacrifice and that he would have a favourable
10480,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,time for battle[390].
10481,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10482,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,The importance of the last case is enhanced by the fact that it is
10483,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"derived from a contemporary poem, the Vellekla (cf. p. 16), in which"
10484,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the ravens are mentioned. In the other cases given above no such early
10485,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"authority is extant, and our texts themselves are separated by a period"
10486,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of from two to three centuries from the events which they relate. But
10487,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,there is no reason for doubting that the stories had long been in
10488,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,existence. It is questionable indeed whether the account of the battle
10489,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of Hiörungavágr could have been invented after all recollection of
10490,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Haakon and his religious observances had died away. The earl's devotion
10491,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to the worship of Thórgerðr Hölgabrúðr is known from other sources;
10492,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,but she seems not to have been a generally recognised member of the
10493,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Northern Pantheon.
10494,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10495,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"However that may be, no doubt can be entertained with regard to the"
10496,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"poem Hákonarmál, which deals with the death of King Haakon I at the"
10497,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"battle of Fitje in 961 (cf. p. 15). The author, Eyvindr Skaldaspillir,"
10498,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,was himself present at the battle. The poem relates how Göndul and
10499,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Skögul were sent by Othin to select a prince of Yngvi's line, who"
10500,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"should go and dwell with him in Valhöll. Then, after a short account of"
10501,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the battle, we are told that ""the princes sat with their swords drawn,"
10502,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,with scarred shields and mail-coats pierced; in no cheerful mood was
10503,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the host which had to make its way to Valhöll. Then said Göndul, as she"
10504,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"leaned upon her spear: 'Now will the forces of the gods be increased,"
10505,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,since they have summoned Haakon to their abodes with a great host.'
10506,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,The prince heard what the noble Valkyries were saying. Thoughtful was
10507,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"their mien, as they sat on their steeds, with helmets upon their heads"
10508,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,and holding their shields before them. 'Why hast thou thus decided the
10509,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"battle, Skögul? Surely we have deserved success from the gods.' 'We"
10510,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,have brought it about that thou hast won the day and that thy foes
10511,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"have fled. Now,' said the mighty Skögul, 'we must ride to the green"
10512,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"homes of the gods, to tell Othin that a monarch is coming to enter his"
10513,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"presence.'"" Then the scene changes to Valhöll; and Othin sends Hermóðr"
10514,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,and Bragi out to meet the king and bid him welcome[391].
10515,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10516,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Such poems as Hákonarmál and Eiríksmál must be regarded as products of
10517,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,vivid poetic imagination. They are clearly in the nature of conscious
10518,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"fiction, though it should not be assumed that the pictures of the"
10519,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,gods and their abode which they present were conceptions altogether
10520,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,unreal to the poets' audiences. I suppose that ultimately this type of
10521,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"composition is derived from visions or dreams, such as the story of"
10522,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Glúmr given above. For, though the latter in its present form dates"
10523,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,from a period at least two centuries later than Hákonarmál--both
10524,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,referring to persons who lived more or less about the same time--it
10525,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,will probably be agreed that the conception there is far more primitive.
10526,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10527,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Now we have good evidence that visions which took the form of visits
10528,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to the home of the gods did really obtain credence in the Viking Age.
10529,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"When St Ansgar visited Sweden for the second time, not long after 850,"
10530,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,he found that the success of his mission was seriously endangered. A
10531,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"man had come to Birca (Biörkö, on the Mälar), where the king, Olaf,"
10532,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"was residing, and stated that he had been present at an assembly"
10533,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"of the gods, who had sent him to deliver a message to the king and"
10534,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,nation. This was to the effect that the gods had long been gracious
10535,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to the Swedes and had preserved their land in peace and prosperity.
10536,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Yet now the Swedes were abandoning their accustomed sacrifices and
10537,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,introducing a strange god. If they wished to retain their favour the
10538,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"sacrifices must be resumed on a larger scale, and the new god must"
10539,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"be refused admittance. ""But if you desire to have more gods, and we"
10540,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"are not sufficient for you, we unanimously enrol in our body Eric who"
10541,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"was formerly your king, so that he shall be counted among the gods."""
10542,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"This story created a profound impression among the inhabitants. ""They"
10543,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"founded a temple in honour of the above-mentioned king, who had long"
10544,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"been dead, and began to offer prayers and sacrifices to him as a"
10545,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"god[392]."""
10546,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10547,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"The Life of St Ansgar, from which this story is taken, is practically a"
10548,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"contemporary authority. It was written by St Rembert, one of Ansgar's"
10549,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"disciples, who succeeded him as Archbishop of Hamburg in 865 and died"
10550,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in 888. In face of such evidence we have no reason for doubting that
10551,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,stories such as that of Glúmr would readily obtain credence. Indeed
10552,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,it seems scarcely impossible that the doings of Thórgerðr Hölgabrúðr
10553,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,at Hiörungavágr may have been believed by persons who were alive at
10554,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the time. Yet credulity was no special characteristic of the Northern
10555,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,peoples. We learn from inscriptions that Asclepios was in the habit
10556,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of showing himself to pilgrims in his temple at Epidauros. Still
10557,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,more striking evidence is furnished by Herodotus' story (I 60) that
10558,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Peisistratos recovered the tyranny at Athens by dressing up a woman
10559,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to personate Athene and accompanying her in a chariot to the city.
10560,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Herodotus himself remarks that this took place at a time when the
10561,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Greek race had long been distinguished from the rest of mankind by its
10562,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,superior sagacity and freedom from silly credulity--and in a state too
10563,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,which was held to be intellectually supreme among the Greeks. Whatever
10564,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,doubt may be entertained as to the truth of the story it is significant
10565,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"enough that Herodotus should record it, apparently without any"
10566,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"hesitation, in less than a century after Peisistratos' death. Some four"
10567,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,centuries earlier men may well have been ready to hear that the gods
10568,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"took an active part in the battles of their fathers or grandfathers,"
10569,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,while the latter themselves may have been quite as ready to attribute
10570,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,their success or failure to the disguised agency of the same powers.
10571,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10572,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,It is clear at all events that the Scandinavian evidence fails to
10573,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,provide any justification for the view that poems which introduce the
10574,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,gods must date from times far removed from the events which they claim
10575,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to commemorate. In the contemporary Hákonarmál we find two of the most
10576,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"advanced Homeric types. First, we have deities participating without"
10577,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,disguise in battle; then a change of scene carries us to the actual
10578,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,home of the gods. The second scene in Hákonarmál--which is likewise the
10579,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,scene of Eiríksmál--may be compared both with the various 'Olympic'
10580,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"episodes and also with the two Nekyiai. For, since Othin is a god of"
10581,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the dead, his abode corresponds in a sense both to Olympos and the"
10582,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,home of Hades. On the whole perhaps the nearest affinities of the two
10583,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Norwegian poems are with the second Nekyia (Od. XXIV 1-204), which is"
10584,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,commonly regarded as one of the latest portions of the Odyssey.
10585,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10586,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Lastly, the Scandinavian evidence gives no support to the belief that"
10587,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the more imaginative types of divine intervention necessarily belong to
10588,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,a later date than the others. In principle of course it may be admitted
10589,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that they are less primitive. But in Old Norse literature it so happens
10590,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that they occur in both earlier and more nearly contemporary works. The
10591,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,explanation lies doubtless in the fact that the theological apparatus
10592,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of Norse poetry was fully developed before the time of our earliest
10593,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"authorities. So far as I can see, there is no good reason for denying"
10594,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that the same remark holds good for the Homeric poems. But if so it is
10595,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,futile to use evidence of this kind as a criterion for determining the
10596,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,date of the various portions.
10597,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10598,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,*       *       *       *       *
10599,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10600,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Monsters and theriomorphic demons are by no means unknown in Greek
10601,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"heroic stories, though in the poems which have come down to us they"
10602,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,figure prominently only in episodes dealing with past events. The
10603,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,nearest Homeric analogies to Beowulf's adventures are perhaps to be
10604,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,found in the stories of Bellerophon and Meleagros[393] (Il. VI 178 ff.;
10605,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"IX 538 ff.). It may be that these stories and others, such as that of"
10606,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Perseus, themselves once formed the main themes of heroic poems, and"
10607,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"that the backward position which they ultimately came to occupy, as"
10608,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"compared with stories of anthropomorphic deities, is due to the growth"
10609,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of poetic art and humanistic tendencies. But on the other hand we have
10610,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to remember that heroic poetry is always liable to the intrusion of
10611,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"folk-tales, in which adventures with monsters form one of the favourite"
10612,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,themes.
10613,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10614,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,The chief store-house of folk-tales in the Homeric poems is the
10615,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,narrative of his adventures given by Odysseus to the Phaeacians (Od.
10616,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"IX-XII). This narrative contains a considerable number of incidents, of"
10617,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,which ten may be regarded as more or less distinct: (i) the encounter
10618,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"with the Cicones, (ii) the visit to the land of the Lotus-eaters, (iii)"
10619,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the adventure with Polyphemos, (iv) the two visits to Aiolos, (v) the"
10620,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"disaster in the land of the Laistrygones, (vi) the two visits to Circe,"
10621,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"(vii) the journey to the home of Hades, (viii) the singing of the"
10622,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Sirens, (ix) the adventure with Scylla and Charybdis, (x) the slaughter"
10623,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of the cattle of Helios.
10624,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10625,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,The first of these incidents bears no obvious traces of derivation or
10626,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,influence from a folk-tale; but it is the only one of the series of
10627,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,which this can be stated with any confidence. The adventures with the
10628,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Lotus-eaters and the Laistrygones should perhaps be regarded rather as
10629,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,travellers' stories--founded possibly on actual experience of foreign
10630,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,peoples--yet the latter at least contains certain distorted features
10631,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,which may fairly bring it within our category. As to the origin of the
10632,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,adventure with Polyphemos there can be little doubt. It appears to be
10633,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,found with slight variants in many different parts of the world[394].
10634,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10635,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,The last incident of the series is perhaps the one least widely known;
10636,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,but a parallel may be cited from one of Saxo's stories (p. 286 f.). A
10637,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,certain Danish king named Gormo[395] was an ardent explorer. Above all
10638,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"he desired to visit the abode of Geruthus (Geirröðr), which lay beyond"
10639,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the ocean in a land of perpetual darkness. Taking with him as guide an
10640,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"experienced traveller, named Thorkillus, he set sail with three ships"
10641,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"and made his way beyond Halogaland (the north of Norway). There, having"
10642,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"lost its way in a storm, the expedition came to be in want of food."
10643,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Eventually they arrived at an island which contained herds of extremely
10644,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,tame cattle. Against the advice of Thorkillus the mariners slaughtered
10645,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,a large number of these. The following night they were attacked by
10646,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"monsters, one of whom declared that they would not be allowed to sail"
10647,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,away until they made compensation for the losses they had inflicted on
10648,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the herd of the gods. In order to save themselves they had to give up
10649,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,one man from each ship.
10650,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10651,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,It will be seen that this incident bears a general resemblance to the
10652,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"slaughtering of the cattle of Helios, and we need scarcely hesitate"
10653,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to regard both stories as variant forms of a folk-tale. As to its
10654,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,origin we are not altogether without evidence in the Northern case. In
10655,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Alcuin's _Vita Willebrordi_, I cap. 10, it is stated that a certain"
10656,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,island (now Heligoland) was entirely sacred to a god named Fosite.
10657,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,So great was the sanctity with which it was regarded that no one
10658,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,ventured to touch any of the animals which grazed upon the island. The
10659,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"violation of the sanctuary, in this and other respects, cost one of St"
10660,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Willebrord's companions his life. Hence there is no need to doubt that
10661,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,a basis of fact underlies the stories of islands in which animal life
10662,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,was held sacred--just as in holy woods throughout the north of Europe.
10663,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,It is scarcely impossible that similar island sanctuaries may once have
10664,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,been known in the Mediterranean.
10665,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10666,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,The subsequent course of the story has a certain affinity with that
10667,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of Circe. After leaving the island Gormo and his men sailed in safety
10668,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"to the farther part of Permland, where they were met by a giant named"
10669,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Guthmundus[396], the brother of Geruthus, who invited them to his"
10670,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,house. Thorkillus strictly enjoined his companions to abstain from all
10671,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"food and drink offered them, even from the fruits which grew in the"
10672,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"garden, and to avoid contact with members of the household. Those who"
10673,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"yielded to temptation, as a few eventually did, would have to spend the"
10674,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,rest of their lives among monsters. There is no actual transformation
10675,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,as in the story of Circe; but this in itself is a widely known incident
10676,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in folk-tales.
10677,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10678,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"When the travellers at length reach the abode of Geruthus the scene,"
10679,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"though horrible in every way, seems to be a variety of the Enchanted"
10680,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Castle rather than a parallel to the home of Hades[397]. We have
10681,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,seen above that the poems Hákonarmál and Eiríksmál may in a sense be
10682,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,compared with the two Nekyiai; for Valhöll is the abode not only of
10683,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the chief god but also of the spirits of fallen warriors. But here
10684,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,we have to deal with elaborate conceptions of court poetry which are
10685,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,further removed from the spirit of the true folk-tale than either of
10686,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the passages in the Odyssey[398]. A better parallel to the first Nekyia
10687,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,is perhaps to be found in another of Saxo's stories (p. 31). Once upon
10688,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"a time, when King Hadingus was feasting, there appeared to him a woman"
10689,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,who was carrying hemlocks. She wrapped him in her mantle and took him
10690,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,with her underground in order to show him where the hemlocks grew. On
10691,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the way they passed through a dark cloud and then along a well-worn
10692,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"path, where they saw many men richly attired. After viewing the sunny"
10693,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"regions where the hemlocks grew, they crossed a rapid river and then"
10694,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,saw two armies engaged in desperate conflict. The woman told Hadingus
10695,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that these were men who had been slain by the sword and continually
10696,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,rehearsed the manner of their death. They are obviously to be connected
10697,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,with the _einheriar_ of Old Norse poetry--the slain warriors who dwell
10698,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in Valhöll and spend their days in combat--though possibly this passage
10699,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,represents a more primitive form of the idea. It is to be observed that
10700,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Saxo himself explicitly interprets the story as a visit to the region
10701,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of the dead.
10702,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10703,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Stories of this kind are to be found in many parts of the world--among
10704,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"peoples as widely apart as the Algonquins, the Zulus and the"
10705,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Maoris[399]. There can be little doubt that to a large extent the first
10706,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Nekyia belongs to the same category. At the same time of course I do
10707,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,not mean to imply that it is wholly to be regarded as a folk-tale.
10708,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,In the interview with Agamemnon and his companions (vv. 385-564) we
10709,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,find ourselves in much the same world of ideas as is presented to us
10710,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"in Eiríksmál and Hákonarmál. Again, it is to be remembered that the"
10711,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"object of Odysseus' journey was to consult the spirit of Teiresias, and"
10712,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,this is perhaps the original kernel of the story. Such an idea however
10713,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,may be derived from ancient religious observances rather than from a
10714,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"folk-tale. Herodotus (V 92) records that Periandros, tyrant of Corinth,"
10715,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"about the close of the sixth century, sent an embassy to the oracle of"
10716,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the dead (νεκυομαντήϊον) on the river Acheron in Thesprotis, in order"
10717,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to consult the spirit of his wife Melissa. After making all allowance
10718,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,for antiquarian and etymological speculation[400] it seems probable
10719,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that this oracle did influence the conceptions of the home of the dead
10720,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,current in Greek poetry.
10721,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10722,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,It would appear then that in the composition of the first Nekyia we
10723,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,have to take account of the influence of at least three different
10724,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"elements--court poetry, folk-tale and religious (necromantic)"
10725,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,observances. If we are right in supposing that Aeolis was the true
10726,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"home of all Homeric poetry, the absence of any precise geographical"
10727,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,indications is easily accounted for. During the centuries which
10728,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,intervened between the end of the Heroic Age and the beginning of
10729,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the historical period there is extremely little evidence, whether"
10730,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"traditional or archaeological, for communication with distant lands;"
10731,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,and it is likely enough that at that time Thesprotis was as unfamiliar
10732,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,as Egypt to the inhabitants of Aeolis. Few scholars will dispute
10733,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that the geographical indications throughout the story of Odysseus'
10734,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,wanderings are both vague and contradictory. Sometimes he appears
10735,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to be in the west; sometimes again he is following the track of the
10736,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Argo--presumably in the Black Sea. That is after all the kind of
10737,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,confusion which might reasonably be expected from poets who were
10738,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,dealing with traditions of voyages made long before in regions now
10739,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,altogether forgotten.

10743,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,The ascription of supernatural properties to men or animals is not a
10744,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,very striking feature in Homeric poetry--unless we include under this
10745,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,head stories of exaggerated prowess. As an example we may cite Il.
10746,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"XIX 404 ff., where one of Achilles' horses speaks and prophesies his"
10747,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,master's death. Incidents such as the flame on the same hero's head in
10748,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Il. XVIII 205 ff. and the changes in Odysseus' appearance (Od. XIII 429
10749,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"ff., etc.) are attributed to the direct action of deities. On the other"
10750,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,hand exaggeration is common and often carried out systematically. Among
10751,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,such cases we must include the feats of valour performed by some of the
10752,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"combatants, and also presumably the numbers of the forces stated in the"
10753,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"catalogues, if we admit that the story of the siege of Troy has any"
10754,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,historical foundation.
10755,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10756,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,On the whole it appears that those elements in the Homeric poems
10757,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,which may quite safely be derived from myth or folk-tale resemble
10758,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the corresponding elements in Teutonic heroic poetry very closely.
10759,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,We may perhaps doubt whether the gods ever figured so conspicuously
10760,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in Teutonic poetry as they do in the Iliad and Odyssey; but the
10761,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,difference between the two cases is one of degree only. In the use made
10762,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of folk-tales the difference is very slight. It remains for us now
10763,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to consider whether the remaining elements in the poems--their main
10764,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,groundwork in fact--should be regarded as of similar origin in both
10765,SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,cases.

10837,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"It is commonly held that history, myth and fiction have all contributed"
10838,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to the formation of the Greek heroic stories; but opinions differ
10839,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,widely as to the relative importance to be attributed to the three
10840,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,elements. Among modern scholars the general tendency has been to assign
10841,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the chief weight to myth. By many indeed the heroes of the Trojan War
10842,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,are believed to be as mythical in origin as the gods themselves.
10843,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10844,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,One conclusion may safely be drawn from the Northern evidence discussed
10845,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in the last chapter: we must definitely dismiss the argument that the
10846,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Homeric heroes cannot have been men of flesh and blood because they
10847,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,are brought into contact with the gods. No one will be so hardy as to
10848,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"suggest that King Haakon or his namesake, the famous earl of Lade,"
10849,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,were products of myth or poetic imagination. Yet Göndul is as much
10850,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,responsible for the death of King Haakon as Athene is for that of
10851,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Hector. There is certainly this difference between the two cases, that"
10852,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,we have no historical evidence for the existence of the Homeric heroes.
10853,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,But the fact that deities participate in their destruction does not in
10854,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,itself prove that they are themselves products of myth or fiction.
10855,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10856,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"There was a time, not so very long ago, when most of the characters"
10857,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of the Greek Heroic Age were believed to owe their origin to
10858,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"nature-myth--personifications of light, darkness and so forth. At the"
10859,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,present time however it is only in some few cases that this view is
10860,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,generally maintained. Its chief stronghold is the case of Achilles; and
10861,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,here we are invariably referred for proof to the story of Sigurðr. The
10862,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,two characters have of course a good deal in common. Both are more
10863,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"or less idealised types of youthful strength and valour, and both die"
10864,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,prematurely. But it would be pure folly to regard these features as
10865,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in themselves proofs of mythical origin. In order to prove this it is
10866,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"necessary to point to features which can only be mythical, and to show"
10867,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that such features formed an original element in the stories.
10868,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10869,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Now we have seen (p. 140 ff.) that the current explanation with
10870,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,regard to Sigurðr is open to the most serious--in my opinion
10871,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,fatal--objections. On the other hand there certainly was a tendency for
10872,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,myth to grow up in later times round this hero. As an instance we may
10873,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"take his invulnerability, a feature which is peculiar to the German"
10874,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,version of the story. Achilles possesses the same characteristic--but
10875,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,not in the Iliad or Odyssey. It is as much unknown in the Homeric
10876,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,account of Achilles as in the Norse account of Sigurðr. Indeed the only
10877,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,essentially mythical feature which the poems themselves record in the
10878,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,case of Achilles--and it is by no means peculiar to his case--is that
10879,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,he is the son of a deity[401]. But divine descent was claimed also by
10880,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"many Teutonic princes, though the heroes of our stories are usually"
10881,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,separated from their divine ancestors by two or three generations[402].
10882,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Whatever may be the explanation of this phenomenon it is doubtless to
10883,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,be connected with the stories of conjugal relations between human and
10884,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,divine beings which we find both in Greece and in northern Europe.
10885,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,This is a subject to which we shall have to return in a later chapter.
10886,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Above all, however, we have to take account of the influence of"
10887,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"folk-tales[403] and popular beliefs, which, as we have seen from the"
10888,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Teutonic evidence, may make itself felt even in the description of very"
10889,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,recent events.
10890,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10891,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,The story of the abduction of Helen is another case for which many
10892,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,scholars still claim a mythical origin. It is perfectly true that
10893,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,stories of (e.g.) the abduction of the sun or the incontinence of the
10894,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"moon[404] do occur, though examples of this type are by no means so"
10895,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,common or widespread as many writers have assumed[405]. But what is apt
10896,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to be overlooked is that these stories arise from a personification of
10897,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the sun or moon, and that it is in consequence of this personification"
10898,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that the heavenly bodies are believed to be exposed to perils and
10899,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,passions such as affect human beings. It is surely nothing less than an
10900,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,inversion of the natural order of things to suppose that the numerous
10901,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,class of folk-tales which deal with the abduction of a girl or wife
10902,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,originated in the type--a comparatively rare type--in which this motif
10903,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,is applied to the sun. There can be no reasonable doubt that the
10904,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,prevalence of such folk-tales is due to the innumerable occurrences of
10905,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,abduction in real life. But the theory we are discussing involves not
10906,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,merely the personification of heavenly bodies and natural phenomena but
10907,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,their complete anthropomorphisation[406]--a very doubtful process in
10908,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the best of cases--whereas the story which it seeks to explain bears no
10909,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,trace even of derivation from a folk-tale. In other words we are asked
10910,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to assume a most complex and precarious hypothesis in order to account
10911,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,for a story for which parallels are to be found very frequently in
10912,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,almost all stages of human society.
10913,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10914,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Of course I do not mean to say that the story of Helen is entirely
10915,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"devoid of mythical elements. On the contrary, it is a most instructive"
10916,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"example of the growth of myth, and as such it furnishes an interesting"
10917,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,parallel to the history of similar stories in the north of Europe. In
10918,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the Iliad Helen possesses no mythical characteristics, except that she"
10919,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,is the offspring of a divine father. In the Cypria she had apparently
10920,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,also acquired a divine mother (Nemesis). By the seventh century we find
10921,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,her figuring in quite a different story of abduction--a story which
10922,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"seems to have been treated by Alcman and Stesichoros, as well as on the"
10923,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"'Chest of Cypselos.' This time she is carried off by Theseus, with the"
10924,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"help of Peirithoos, and rescued by her brothers, the Dioscoroi[407]."
10925,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Somewhat later we find a new version of the story of her abduction by
10926,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Paris. Now it is said to be only her εἴδωλον which is carried off by
10927,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Paris; Helen herself is taken by Hermes to Egypt[408]. There seems
10928,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to be little reason for doubting that the εἴδωλον was a deliberate
10929,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"invention of Stesichoros, though in other respects this version of the"
10930,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"story may well have been influenced by the Egyptian version, recorded"
10931,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,by Herodotus (II 112 ff.). The latter again comes in all probability
10932,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"from Greek settlers in Egypt, who connected the narrative of Helen's"
10933,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"sojourn in Egypt, related in the Odyssey (IV 125 ff., 351 ff.), with"
10934,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,a cult which they found existing in that country. This version of the
10935,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,story then should perhaps be regarded as a product of fiction rather
10936,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"than myth. The other story however--that of Theseus, Peirithoos and the"
10937,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Dioscoroi--is doubtless of popular origin. It is important to notice
10938,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that both these pairs of heroes are connected with other stories of
10939,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,abduction[409]. Moreover in both cases these stories have certain
10940,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,elements in common with that of Persephone. There can be little doubt
10941,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,therefore that we have to deal with a folk-tale. The introduction
10942,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of Helen into the story may be due partly to her kinship with the
10943,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Dioscoroi and partly to the influence of the story of her abduction by
10944,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Paris.
10945,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,

10947,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10948,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,At the present time it appears to be the more general opinion that the
10949,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Homeric heroes originated mainly not in personifications of natural
10950,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"phenomena, but in tribal divinities or personified conceptions of"
10951,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,peoples ('hypostasierte Volksindividualitäten'). Now we have seen (p.
10952,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,131 f.) that in Teutonic heroic poetry we occasionally meet with the
10953,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"mythical eponymous ancestors of families, though such persons are"
10954,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,referred to the past and not introduced into the main action of the
10955,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,stories. Similar characters are to be found in the Homeric poems.
10956,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Perhaps the best example occurs in a speech of Aineias (Il. XX 200
10957,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"ff.), where the names Δάρδανος, Τρῶς, and Ἶλος are included in the"
10958,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"hero's genealogy. The Cadmos of Od. V 333 is probably to be regarded,"
10959,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"in some sense or other, as the eponymous ancestor of the Cadmeioi,"
10960,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"though he is not mentioned in connection with Thebes. Again, in Od."
10961,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"XVII 207 we have a reference to eponymous heroes of places, Ithacos"
10962,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"and Neritos. They are perhaps creatures of the poet's own imagination,"
10963,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,i.e. fictitious rather than mythical beings; but it is probable that
10964,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,they were modelled upon existing types. Other examples of both types
10965,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,may be found elsewhere in the poems[410]. Yet it cannot be said that
10966,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"they are common. In Greece, as in northern Europe, the true home of"
10967,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"eponymous ancestors (Hellen, Doros, Achaios, etc.[411]) is to be found"
10968,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"in post-heroic, or at least non-heroic, literature."
10969,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10970,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,In recent years however several scholars have put forward the theory
10971,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that the characters who figure in the main action of the Iliad are
10972,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,tribal heroes in disguise. For a simple example of this theory we may
10973,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"refer to the interpretation put upon Il. V 43 ff., where the Cretan"
10974,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,leader Idomeneus is represented as slaying a man named Phaistos
10975,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,(Φαῖστος). Now there was in Crete a well-known city called Phaistos
10976,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"(Φαιστός). According to Prof. E. Bethe (_Neue Jahrbücher_, VII 669)"
10977,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,it cannot be disputed that the man Phaistos is the 'eponym' of the
10978,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,city and that we have here the remains of an ancient Cretan heroic
10979,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,lay. But the origin of the man is stated explicitly enough in the poem
10980,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,(_l.c._): he is the son of Boros the Maeonian and had come from a place
10981,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,called Tarne. Before we can assume that he was the 'eponym' of a Cretan
10982,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,city we must surely ask how he came to be represented as a Maeonian
10983,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,(Lydian). Is it inconceivable that a name identical with that of a city
10984,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,should be borne by anyone except the eponymous hero of the city?
10985,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10986,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,This is not the only case of the kind which has been brought forward.
10987,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,In Il. V 706 we hear of an Aetolian named Trechos slain by Hector and
10988,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in Il. XX 455 of a Trojan named Dryops slain by Achilles. Here we are
10989,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,said to have 'eponyms' of Trachis and the Dryopes. In England during
10990,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the centuries immediately following the Heroic Age we find mention in
10991,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"historical documents of princes or ecclesiastics called Walh, Cumbra,"
10992,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Seaxa, Dene, Fronca, etc. Are we to suppose that these persons are the"
10993,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"eponymous heroes of the Welsh or Cymry, the Saxons, Danes and Franks?"
10994,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,But national names of this type seem to have been just as frequently
10995,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"used by the Greeks, at least in historical times. We may mention"
10996,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Achaios of Eretria, Ion of Chios and Dorieus the brother of Leonidas."
10997,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Is there any reason for denying their use in earlier times[412]?
10998,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
10999,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,The evidence of these names has been brought forward in support of
11000,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,a far-reaching theory--that the conflicts which we find described
11001,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in the Iliad are echoes of tribal struggles which once took place
11002,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"in Greece, and that the warriors, Trojans as well as Greeks, are in"
11003,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,reality mythical heroes in whom the various contending tribes have
11004,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,become personified. If this theory is sound it will be obvious that the
11005,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,resemblance between Greek and Teutonic heroic poetry must be merely
11006,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,superficial--that the two groups of poems spring from essentially
11007,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,different sources. It will be well then to examine somewhat carefully
11008,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the evidence on which the theory is based.
11009,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11010,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,The first argument in its favour is derived from a story quoted by
11011,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Plutarch (_Theseus_, cap. 34) from Istros, a writer of the third"
11012,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"century, to the effect that Alexandros (Paris) was overcome by Achilles"
11013,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,and Patroclos on the banks of the Spercheios. In confirmation of this
11014,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,story it is pointed out that the warriors with whom Paris fights
11015,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"in the Iliad mostly belong to Thessaly, while his sister Alexandra"
11016,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,(Cassandra) was worshipped by the Locrians. Another argument rests on
11017,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"a story derived from the Little Iliad, that Andromache was brought"
11018,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to Pharsalos after the fall of Troy. The inference that she belonged
11019,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,originally to this region is supported by the proposed identification
11020,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"of Thebe Hypoplacie, her home in the Iliad, with the Phthiotic Thebes,"
11021,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to the east of Pharsalos. Yet a further argument relates to Hector.
11022,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"It is noted that he was worshipped as a hero at Thebes in Boeotia,"
11023,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"and that most of the persons associated with him, either as friends"
11024,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"or foes, are connected with Boeotia, Thessaly and the intervening"
11025,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"districts. In Prof. Bethe's words ""Hector's tracks lead from southern"
11026,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Thessaly, through Phocis and Boeotia, to the Cadmean Thebes."" ""In other"
11027,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"words Hector, or rather the tribe which honoured Hector as their hero,"
11028,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"migrated by this road. More accurately, the tribe gradually, in how"
11029,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"many centuries none can tell, moved in a south-easterly direction,"
11030,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,driven by a pressure which was no doubt exerted by the Aeolic tribe
11031,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"represented in the Epos by Achilles[413]."""
11032,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11033,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Now it is manifest that the argument derived from Istros' story
11034,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,can have validity only if it can be shown that there is reason for
11035,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"believing it to be based on genuine native tradition, independent of"
11036,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the Homeric poems. For everyone who has studied the history of Teutonic
11037,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,heroic poetry knows that in the later forms of the stories the scene is
11038,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,liable to be changed to entirely different countries. Thus the fight
11039,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of Heðinn and Högni is located in the Orkneys in the Norse version of
11040,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"their story, while in Kûdrûn Hagen is made a king in Ireland. Again,"
11041,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in the Vitae Duorum Offarum the whole story of Offa and his single
11042,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"combat is transplanted to the English Mercia, the home of the hero's"
11043,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,descendants. Yet in the case of Istros' story the requisite evidence
11044,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,seems to be altogether wanting. If the story really comes from local
11045,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,tradition it may very well be due to an imperfect acquaintance with the
11046,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Homeric poems. But the context, which mentions Hector as well as Paris,"
11047,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,suggests rather that Istros was referring not to the story of the Iliad
11048,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,at all but to an early adventure of the two brothers[414]--presumably
11049,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"one of those accretions to the old heroic cycles, for which so many"
11050,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,parallels can be found in late Teutonic authorities like Thiðreks Saga
11051,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,af Bern.
11052,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11053,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,The argument relating to the Locrian cult of Alexandra (Cassandra)
11054,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"need scarcely be considered at length; for, however ancient this cult"
11055,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"may have been, it was always connected with the sanctuary of Athene"
11056,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,at Troy[415]. The cult of Hector at Thebes likewise seems to have
11057,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"been derived from the same quarter, perhaps in comparatively late"
11058,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"times[416]. Again, the identification of Andromache's home with Thebes"
11059,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in Phthiotis is admittedly nothing more than a conjecture.
11060,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11061,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"One argument still remains for consideration, namely that the persons"
11062,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,brought into contact with Hector come chiefly from the north-eastern
11063,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,parts of Greece and those encountered by Paris chiefly from Thessaly.
11064,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Now it is to be observed that several of the persons whose names
11065,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"figure in Prof. Bethe's lists (_op. cit._, p. 670 ff.) are not said"
11066,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"to come from Thessaly, Boeotia, etc. in the Iliad itself. That they"
11067,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,were derived from this quarter is merely an inference from the fact
11068,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"that other persons belonging to Thessaly, Boeotia, etc. bear the same"
11069,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"names. It cannot for a moment be suspected that in V. 705, XV. 547 ff."
11070,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the poets themselves were thinking of Orestes the son of Agamemnon or
11071,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of Melanippos the famous Theban hero. But surely nothing can be more
11072,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,absurd than the proposition that persons who bear the same name must
11073,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,necessarily be identical in origin. In the Teutonic Heroic Age we know
11074,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"from historical sources of five kings named Theodric, all of whom were"
11075,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,living within half a century of one another. Have we any reason for
11076,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,supposing that the ancient Greeks were more careful to avoid the use of
11077,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,names which had already been appropriated?[417]
11078,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11079,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Again, the lists given by Prof. Bethe contain merely a selection of"
11080,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the warriors encountered by Paris and Hector. The former fights in
11081,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the Iliad not only with the Thessalian heroes Machaon, Eurypylos and"
11082,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Menesthios, but also with Menelaos from Sparta, Diomedes from Argos and"
11083,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Euchenor from Corinth. Hector's antagonists include, among others, Aias"
11084,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"from Salamis, Stichios from Athens, Periphetes from Mycenae, Lycophron"
11085,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,from Cythera and Amphimachos from Elis. On the other hand Melanippos is
11086,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"merely one, and by no means the most conspicuous, of the same hero's"
11087,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,supporters. Considering the evidence as a whole therefore I fail to see
11088,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that this argument is worth any more than the others.
11089,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11090,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,It appears then that the evidence adduced in favour of the theory which
11091,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,we are discussing is open to serious objection at every point[418].
11092,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"But, leaving questions of detail, we have yet to notice that the theory"
11093,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,as a whole consists of two main propositions. The first of these is
11094,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"that the warriors of the Iliad are really 'tribal heroes,' i.e. in some"
11095,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,sense or other personifications of tribes. In other words the contests
11096,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,described in the poem were originally conflicts of tribes and not of
11097,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,individuals. The second proposition is that these conflicts must have
11098,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,taken place between neighbouring tribes. It will be seen that this
11099,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,proposition depends very largely upon the first. If the conflicts of
11100,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the Iliad really took place, as the poem states, between individual"
11101,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"warriors or bands of soldiers, there is no occasion for supposing that"
11102,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the combatants were necessarily neighbours. As far back as the twelfth
11103,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"and thirteenth centuries Egyptian monuments testify, as we have seen,"
11104,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to enterprises far more distant than the expedition against Troy.
11105,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11106,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Now the first proposition is of course nothing new in itself. On the
11107,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"contrary, Prof. Bethe's theory is an outgrowth from a view which has"
11108,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,been long and widely current--that the conflicts recorded in the Iliad
11109,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,are a reflection of the Aeolic settlement of the Asiatic coast. His
11110,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,purpose has been to show that only a comparatively small portion of the
11111,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"story comes from this source[419], and that the bulk is derived from"
11112,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"reminiscences of earlier tribal struggles in Greece, which have become"
11113,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,embedded in the story of Troy. The two theories differ very greatly in
11114,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the explanations which they give of the origin of various incidents
11115,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,and characters. But it is not to be overlooked that the principle of
11116,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,interpretation is the same in both cases.
11117,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11118,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,No one will deny that the personification of tribes and nationalities
11119,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,is to be found in both the poetry and the prose literature of many
11120,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,peoples. In certain passages of the Old Testament this principle
11121,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of interpretation has been recognised from ancient times. But the
11122,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,authorities in which these passages occur cannot be described as
11123,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,heroic poems. Again Greek literature itself also yields plenty of
11124,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"obvious examples, such as the stories of Hellen and his sons and"
11125,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Danaos, several of which can be traced back to quite early poems."
11126,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"But these poems appear to have been of the Hesiodic, and not of the"
11127,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Homeric school. If we turn to the Teutonic peoples, evidence for"
11128,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"such personification is abundant, and some of it belongs to our very"
11129,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"earliest records. But, except in genealogical references such as we"
11130,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"have dealt with above (p. 267), examples are not to be found in heroic"
11131,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,poetry. The idea that the characters who are brought before us in
11132,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the poems--let us say Beowulf or Sigurðr or Witege--are themselves
11133,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,personifications of tribes is one which probably no scholar would
11134,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,entertain.
11135,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11136,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Now in the Homeric poems, as we have them, just as much as in Teutonic"
11137,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"heroic poetry, the interest of the poets lies in the fortunes of"
11138,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"individual heroes, not in those of the communities to which they"
11139,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,belong. Even in those Teutonic stories which have the least claim to
11140,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,be regarded as historical there is no reason for doubting that such
11141,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,was the case from the very beginning. On the other hand the current
11142,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,hypothesis with regard to the origin of the Greek heroic stories
11143,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,postulates what can only be described as a complete revolution in the
11144,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,interests of the poets and their audiences. This however is a postulate
11145,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"which ought not to be accepted, unless decisive evidence is forthcoming"
11146,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in its favour.
11147,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11148,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,In the first place it must be observed that the existence of a poem or
11149,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,story which deals with reminiscences of tribal conflicts necessarily
11150,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,presupposes an absorbing interest in tribal history. It will probably
11151,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,be admitted by everyone that this interest can hardly have been of
11152,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"an academic character; indeed, we may assume, I think, that it must"
11153,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"be inspired by patriotic motives. If so, the foremost place will"
11154,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,naturally be taken by that tribe or community with which the story
11155,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,originated. Now it is generally agreed that the Homeric poems contain
11156,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"both Aeolic and Ionic elements. Further, though opinions differ"
11157,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"widely as to the relative importance of the two, there is a practical"
11158,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,unanimity in believing that the Aeolic element is the earlier one. The
11159,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"tribal interest then, at least in the earlier elements in the poems,"
11160,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,should be essentially Aeolic. For 'Aeolic' we may practically say
11161,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Thessalian (using the term of course in a geographical sense); for the
11162,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Aeolic settlements, mainly at least, had proceeded from Thessaly. But"
11163,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Achilles, the chief hero of the Iliad, himself belongs to Thessaly; and"
11164,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"so all is well. Further, many scholars hold that the later or Ionic"
11165,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,elements in the poem are marked by the introduction of Nestor. There
11166,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"was, apparently, a tradition current in Colophon that the inhabitants"
11167,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of that city had originally come from Pylos. Nestor therefore may be
11168,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"regarded as typifying the later or Ionic interests of the Iliad, just"
11169,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,as Achilles typifies its earlier or Aeolic interests. This opinion
11170,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,however is by no means so widely entertained as the other.
11171,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11172,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,So much for the Iliad; now let us turn to the Odyssey. Here we are
11173,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,confronted with a serious difficulty. Odysseus is at least as much the
11174,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,hero of the Odyssey as Achilles is of the Iliad. But Odysseus belongs
11175,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to the Ionian Isles; and there is no trace of either an Aeolic or an
11176,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Ionic population in these islands. It is not surprising then that
11177,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the Odyssey is put aside by the advocates of the theory which we are
11178,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,discussing. The tendency is to regard it as a later work--originating
11179,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,perhaps at a time when tribal interests had become forgotten. We must
11180,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,confine our attention therefore to the Iliad.
11181,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11182,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,As applied to the Iliad the theory was long ago seen to be open to
11183,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,one serious objection. Achilles is the only one of the chief Achaean
11184,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,leaders who can be referred to Thessaly. His nearest neighbour is the
11185,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Locrian Aias; but the Locrians, in spite of their connection with Troy,"
11186,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,cannot be regarded as an Aeolic people. All the other Achaean leaders
11187,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,who may be termed 'heroes of the first rank' belong to the southern
11188,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,and western parts of Greece. Their positions geographically cannot be
11189,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,reconciled with the theory of Aeolic tribal wars. In order to obviate
11190,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,this difficulty various suggestions have been put forward. On the one
11191,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"hand we have Prof. Bethe's hypothesis which brings the Trojan leaders,"
11192,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Hector and Paris, to the north-eastern parts of Greece. Upon this"
11193,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,enough has been said above. On the other hand there is an older and
11194,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"still very popular hypothesis, according to which some of the southern"
11195,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"leaders, Agamemnon in particular, originally belonged to the northern"
11196,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,parts of the country. It is to this that we must now turn our attention.
11197,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11198,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,In the Iliad Mycenae is represented as being the home of Agamemnon.
11199,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,But it has been observed that this place is comparatively seldom
11200,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"mentioned, and that sometimes Agamemnon is said to rule over 'Argos.'"
11201,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Unfortunately there is a considerable amount of ambiguity in the use
11202,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of the latter name. Occasionally it denotes the well-known city in
11203,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Argolis; but more often it is clearly used in a much wider sense, for"
11204,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the Peloponnesos or the whole of Greece. Once however (II 681) we find
11205,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the expression τὸ Πελασγικὸν Ἄργος as a name for the home of Achilles.
11206,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,In ancient times the meaning of this expression was not known. Some
11207,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"authorities believed it to be the name of a city, while others"
11208,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,understood it as a designation for the plain of Thessaly. Many modern
11209,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"scholars have adopted the latter interpretation. But further, they"
11210,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"hold that this was the original Argos, and that the application of that"
11211,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,name to the Peloponnesos or any part of it is due to a misunderstanding
11212,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"on the part of later (Ionic) poets, by whose time the northern Argos"
11213,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,had been forgotten.
11214,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11215,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,In favour of this view Prof. Cauer[420] brings forward the following
11216,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"arguments. ""If Agamemnon, as well as Achilles, belongs to the oldest"
11217,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"elements in the story, he also must come from a land in which Aeolic"
11218,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,was spoken; and indeed not Aeolic in the extended sense which the
11219,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,ancients gave the term--where the name includes Elean and Arcadian--but
11220,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Lesbian-Aeolic. This was, as inscriptions show, the language of the"
11221,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"original inhabitants of Thessaly."" Again ""Agamemnon started with his"
11222,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,fleet from Aulis.... He was associated with Achilles in the story from
11223,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the beginning. His Argeioi are the companions of the Achaeans led by
11224,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Achilles. The two tribal names are used for one another indifferently,"
11225,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,and either of them can be employed as a designation for the forces
11226,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,which fought at Troy. Consequently the Argeioi and the Achaeans
11227,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"must have been neighbours."" Further, it is urged by Prof. Cauer"
11228,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that the epithet ἱππόβοτον as applied to the Peloponnesian Argos is
11229,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"inappropriate. This state possessed no cavalry in the fifth century,"
11230,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,and none of consequence at any time. On the other hand it is a very
11231,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,suitable epithet for the plain of the Peneios; Thessalian cavalry were
11232,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"famous. Lastly, it is argued that the expression καθ' (ἀν') Ἑλλάδα καὶ"
11233,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"μέσον Ἄργος, which occurs four times in the Odyssey, must originally"
11234,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"have denoted two neighbouring districts, though in the passages in"
11235,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,question it is used in a very wide sense--perhaps for all Greece.
11236,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11237,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,The last argument does not seem to me to have any decisive bearing
11238,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"upon the question under discussion. If we admit, as I think we must,"
11239,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that Homeric poetry is essentially Aeolic and that Aeolis was settled
11240,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"mainly from Thessaly, it is only natural that the poems should preserve"
11241,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"traces of traditional Thessalian phraseology, just as they preserve"
11242,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,poetic conceptions which must have originated in the same country.
11243,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"But, though we grant that the phrases in question may possibly have"
11244,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"been used originally of the Thessalian Argos mentioned in II 681, we"
11245,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,are not bound thereby to conclude that this was the only Argos known
11246,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"to the earliest poems on the siege of Troy. Again, it is scarcely"
11247,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,inconceivable that the traditional epithet ἱππόβοτον may have been
11248,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"transferred from one Argos to the other, though on the other hand there"
11249,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,seems to be good reason for doubting whether the application of this
11250,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,term to the Peloponnesian Argos is as much out of place as has been
11251,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,alleged[421]. Still less cogent is the argument relating to Aulis. For
11252,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the assembling of such a fleet as the story describes the choice of a
11253,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,convenient central position in sheltered waters would be suggested by
11254,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the most elementary notions of strategy.
11255,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11256,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,All these however are comparatively minor considerations. I doubt if
11257,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,they would have been seriously brought forward except as reinforcements
11258,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"to the main contention--viz. that Agamemnon, like Achilles, must have"
11259,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"come from an Aeolic district, if he belongs to the oldest elements in"
11260,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the story. It is surprising to see how this principle appears to have
11261,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,commanded the assent of Homeric scholars. To anyone who has made a
11262,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,study of Teutonic heroic poetry such an argument seems nothing less
11263,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,than absurd. Out of 132 personal names which occur in the Anglo-Saxon
11264,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"heroic poems only three or four, so far as we know, belong to persons"
11265,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of English nationality (cf. p. 32 ff.). Beowulf is concerned almost
11266,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"exclusively with the doings of princes of the Danes, Götar and Swedes."
11267,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"In Waldhere, another English poem, the characters are Burgundians and"
11268,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,(perhaps) Franks; in the German Hildebrandslied they are apparently
11269,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Goths. The Norse poems of the Older Edda are occupied chiefly with the
11270,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"adventures of Huns, Burgundians and Goths. What need then is there"
11271,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,for supposing that Agamemnon must have belonged to the same branch
11272,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of the Greek race as Achilles? And what need is there for supposing
11273,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that an Aeolic poem must contain any Aeolic characters at all? In the
11274,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Odyssey it is not the case. In the Iliad, as we have it, only a small"
11275,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,proportion of the characters at most can be regarded as Aeolic[422].
11276,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11277,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,The reason why Agamemnon must belong to an Aeolic district is
11278,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,clearly to be found in the assumption that both he and Achilles were
11279,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,originally not individuals but personifications of tribes. Starting
11280,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,from this assumption we become involved in a series of hypotheses each
11281,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of which is dependent upon the preceding one. i. The sources of the
11282,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Iliad were concerned only, or at least chiefly, with the fortunes of"
11283,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"tribes (though in point of fact the Iliad, as it stands, is concerned"
11284,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,only with the fortunes of individuals). ii. These tribes belonged
11285,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to adjacent districts (though in fact the heroes of the Iliad are
11286,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,represented as coming from nearly all parts of Greece). iii. Since
11287,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Achilles belongs to an Aeolic district, Agamemnon and the Argos over"
11288,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,which he rules must be located in the same quarter. But the third
11289,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,hypothesis is by no means the only one which is dependent upon the
11290,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"second. Menelaos must have been transferred from the north, i.e. from"
11291,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Thessaly, with his brother. Again, Pylos lies far away from any Aeolic"
11292,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,district. Here we have a choice between two hypotheses. Some hold that
11293,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Nestor, like Agamemnon, belonged originally to Thessaly (the district"
11294,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of the river Enipeus); others that he is a late and Ionic addition
11295,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to the story. With Diomedes the case is somewhat similar. He cannot
11296,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"have ruled over Argos even in the second stage of the story; for then,"
11297,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"before Mycenae was introduced, Argos belonged to Agamemnon. Either"
11298,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"then he has been transferred from Aetolia, the home of his ancestors;"
11299,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"or he is a late addition, due to Ionic poets. Again, Idomeneus' case"
11300,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,is due to 'attraction'; originally he belonged to quite a different
11301,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"cycle of story, like Tlepolemos. Aias, the son of Telamon, is clearly"
11302,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,a 'doublet' of the Locrian Aias; and so forth. By this process we are
11303,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,enabled to dispose satisfactorily of all the southern Greek heroes.
11304,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11305,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,It will be seen that according to some scholars only a few of the
11306,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"leading heroes belonged to the original form of the story, and that"
11307,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,their number has grown by gradual accretions. According to others the
11308,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,majority were there from the beginning; but they belonged originally
11309,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"to the northern parts of Greece, more especially the Aeolic districts."
11310,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,With reference to this latter view it may be observed that the Aeolic
11311,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,districts are by no means unrepresented in the Iliad as we have it.
11312,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,On the contrary we find a considerable number of leaders both from
11313,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Thessaly and Boeotia; but they are all what we may term 'heroes of the
11314,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,second rank.' Are we to suppose that these are 'Ionic' substitutions
11315,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"for the original heroes, when the latter were transferred to the"
11316,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,southern parts of Greece?
11317,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11318,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,But we have yet to consider a more important question than this. In
11319,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the Iliad itself only two of the leading heroes, namely Achilles and"
11320,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the Locrian Aias, are represented as coming from the northern parts"
11321,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of Greece. But the Locrians cannot be regarded as an Aeolic people.
11322,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Achilles then is the only leading hero whose Aeolic nationality
11323,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"rests on any solid evidence, and it is, as we have seen, chiefly"
11324,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,owing to their association with him that the same nationality is
11325,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,claimed by hypothesis for Agamemnon and the rest. But before we bring
11326,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,our discussion to a close it will be well to ask whether Achilles'
11327,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,nationality really is established beyond question by the evidence.
11328,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11329,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,It has been mentioned above that 'the Pelasgian Argos' is said to be
11330,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the home of Achilles, though unfortunately neither ancient nor modern"
11331,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,scholars have been able to determine with certainty what is meant by
11332,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that name. Of the other places recorded in the same context (Il. II 681
11333,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"ff.[423])--viz. Alos, Alope, Trechis, Phthia and Hellas--all except the"
11334,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,third are involved in somewhat similar obscurity. Phthia--whether it
11335,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,be a city or a district--was generally located between Mt Othrys and
11336,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the Malian Gulf. Hellas was believed to be in the same neighbourhood,"
11337,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,if not actually identical with Phthia; some placed it on the north
11338,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"side of Othrys, a short distance away. The names Ἄλος and Ἀλόπη were"
11339,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"borne in historical times by places in Locris, and also by other places"
11340,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"in Phthiotis, on the Pagasean Gulf and the Malian Gulf respectively."
11341,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Opinion was divided as to which of these were the places mentioned in
11342,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the Iliad. Trechis (Trachis) lay on the south of the Spercheios.
11343,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11344,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"It must not be overlooked that, except the indefinite Hellas and"
11345,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Phthia, all these places, including 'the Pelasgian Argos,' are"
11346,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"mentioned only in the Catalogue of Ships, a section of the poem which"
11347,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,is commonly regarded with very little respect. Indeed the same scholars
11348,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,who lay so much stress upon the Pelasgian Argos as the home of Achilles
11349,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,have no hesitation about rejecting the evidence of the Catalogue as
11350,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"to the homes of Agamemnon, Menelaos, Nestor, Diomedes and others."
11351,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Yet the Thessalian section of the Catalogue is admittedly far more
11352,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,difficult to understand than any other. It is scarcely credible that
11353,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the poet responsible for it can have been personally acquainted with
11354,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the places he was enumerating. Now in other parts of the poem Achilles
11355,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,and his followers are associated with the Spercheios or Ellada; from
11356,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"XVI 173 ff., XXIII 144 ff. it is quite clear that his home was supposed"
11357,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to be in the immediate neighbourhood of that river. According to
11358,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"IX 484 his vassal Phoinix rules over the Dolopes, a people who, at"
11359,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"least in historical times, inhabited the mountainous country to the"
11360,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"north-west[424]. These indications, it will be seen, agree perfectly"
11361,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,well with the only place in the Catalogue which can be identified with
11362,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"certainty, namely Trechis. On the whole also they favour the view that"
11363,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,'Alope' is the Phthiotic Alope. Achilles' country then is the basin of
11364,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the Spercheios, together probably with the coast lands on the Malian"
11365,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Gulf between the mountains of Oite and Othrys. It may have included the
11366,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"northern slopes of the latter, in the territory of the Dolopes; but"
11367,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,neither the evidence of the Catalogue itself nor references in other
11368,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,parts of the Iliad give us any warrant for supposing that it extended
11369,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,into the plain of Larissa[425].
11370,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11371,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Now there is not a particle of evidence that an Aeolic dialect was
11372,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,ever spoken either in the basin of the Spercheios or in the districts
11373,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,bordering on the coasts of the Malian Gulf. A form (Μαχαειος) which may
11374,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,be an Aeolic patronymic occurs in an inscription from Melitaia[426];
11375,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"but the inscription in other respects is definitely non-Aeolic,"
11376,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,although Melitaia lies to the north of Othrys. A similar form
11377,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"(Ευβιοτεια) occurs in an inscription found near Pteleon[427], which"
11378,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,is too short for us to determine its character; but Pteleon lies in
11379,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the extreme east of Phthiotis, outside the Malian Gulf, and according"
11380,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to the Catalogue belonged to Protesilaos. The only inscription of
11381,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,definitely Aeolic (Thessalian) character as yet found in Phthiotis
11382,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"comes from near Eretria, just inside the boundary. This place is not"
11383,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"mentioned in the Catalogue, or elsewhere in the Iliad; but Strabo"
11384,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,(IX 5. 10) conjectured that it belonged to Achilles' territories. If
11385,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,we are to follow the indications given by the Catalogue the question
11386,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,would seem to lie between the territories of Protesilaos and those of
11387,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Eurypylos; there is nothing to show that Achilles' country was believed
11388,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to extend so far. It is most surprising therefore to find Prof.
11389,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Cauer[428] concluding from such evidence as this that ""we are justified"
11390,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in claiming the valley of the Spercheios also as an Aeolic district and
11391,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Achilles as a hero of Aeolic nationality."""
11392,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11393,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,For the language of Achilles' country itself we are by no means without
11394,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,evidence. Fairly long inscriptions have been found at Hypate in the
11395,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"valley of the Spercheios and at Lamia, to the north of the Malian"
11396,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Gulf--to which may be added an inscription, apparently of the Oitaioi,"
11397,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,at Drymaia in Phocis. All these show the form of language usually known
11398,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"as 'north-west Greek,' and the same is true of other inscriptions found"
11399,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"in the north and east of Phthiotis. Although they are all late, there"
11400,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,is no valid reason for doubting that this language is indigenous[429].
11401,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Only two inscriptions[430], so far as I know, contain references to"
11402,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Aetolian magistrates. The dialect is almost identical not only with
11403,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"that of the Aetolian inscriptions, but also with those of the Locrians"
11404,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"and Phocians, the former of which is well known from much earlier"
11405,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,times. Greek communities as a general rule were slow to change their
11406,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"language, and the influence of the Aetolian League was scarcely of such"
11407,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,a character as to favour the permanent extension of its dialect[431].
11408,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11409,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"If we are to trust all the evidence which we possess Othrys, and not"
11410,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Oite, was the southern limit of the Aeolic (Thessalian) dialect. The"
11411,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"communities of Phthiotis were politically dependent upon Thessaly,"
11412,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,but they seem never to have been subjugated in the same way as
11413,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the Aeolic population north of the mountains[432]. They had their
11414,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,own troops and sent a separate contingent to Xerxes' army. Indeed
11415,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Herodotus (VII 173, 196 ff.) clearly distinguishes between 'Thessaly'"
11416,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,and 'Achaia' (i.e. Phthiotis). Moreover it appears to have been the
11417,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,general opinion among the Greeks themselves that this district was
11418,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the original home of the Achaeans of the Peloponnesos. Pausanias (VII
11419,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"1. 6) traces the Peloponnesian Achaeans to Archandros and Architeles,"
11420,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the sons of Achaios, who had come from Phthiotis[433]. Herodotus (II"
11421,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"98) was evidently familiar with some form of this story, though he"
11422,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,calls Archandros son of Phthios and grandson of Achaios. The supposed
11423,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,connection therefore goes back at least to the fifth century. How far
11424,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,these genealogies were constructed upon linguistic affinities is a
11425,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,question which needs some discussion. We may remark in passing however
11426,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"that the dialect of the Peloponnesian Achaia, so far as it is known to"
11427,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"us[434], shows but little difference from the dialects north of the"
11428,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Gulf of Corinth. It is commonly included in the list of 'north-west
11429,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Greek' dialects.
11430,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11431,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,In the meantime we may notice an argument which has sometimes been
11432,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,brought forward in support of the hypothesis that Aeolic was once
11433,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,spoken much further south. This is the presence of an Aeolic or
11434,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,semi-Aeolic form of language in Boeotia. The ancients themselves
11435,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,believed that the Boeotians were not indigenous. Thucydides (I 12)
11436,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,states that they had been expelled by the Thessalians from 'Arne'
11437,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,after the Trojan War; but this was not the only form of the story. On
11438,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the other hand many modern scholars have adopted the view that the
11439,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"'north-western' dialects of Locris and Phocis were intrusive[435], and"
11440,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that the non-Aeolic characteristics of the Boeotian dialect itself
11441,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,were due to an extension of the same movement--in short that Aeolic
11442,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,was the earliest form of Greek spoken throughout the whole region
11443,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,from Thessaly down to the borders of Attica. For such a displacement
11444,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of population[436] no evidence is to be found either in history or
11445,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,tradition. Moreover this hypothesis has opposed to it the evidence of
11446,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,what may be called linguistic geography. The Ionic dialects of Euboea
11447,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,and Attica have much more in common with the 'north-western' dialects
11448,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of Locris and Phocis than they have with Boeotian. The latter indeed
11449,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,stands quite isolated in many respects among the dialects of this part
11450,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of Greece. It will be sufficient here to notice the close pronunciation
11451,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of _ē_ (e.g. in Gen. sg. μεινός) and the open pronunciation of _ŏ_
11452,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,(e.g. in Acc. pl. τώς)--both of which are probably to be regarded
11453,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,as Aeolic characteristics--the use of Aeolic patronymics in _-ios_
11454,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,(e.g. Ἵππων Ἀθανοδώριος) and more especially the Aeolic tendency
11455,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"to change labiovelar explosives into labials before _ē̆_, which we"
11456,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"find exemplified at both extremities of the Boeotian area (Βελφοί,"
11457,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Πευματτός). The last peculiarity is doubtless one of the earliest
11458,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,cases of dialectal variation which can be traced in the Greek language;
11459,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,but it is impossible to date. All this evidence tends to show that
11460,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Aeolic was the intrusive element--in other words, to confirm the"
11461,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,tradition that Boeotia was at some time invaded by settlers from an
11462,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Aeolic-speaking district[437].
11463,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11464,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,In recent years there has been a tendency to classify the Greek
11465,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,dialects in two main groups--'East Greek' and 'West Greek.' In the
11466,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"former are included Arcadian, Cypriot, Ionic (with Attic) and the"
11467,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Aeolic dialects, i.e. Thessalian and Lesbian-Aeolic, together with the"
11468,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Aeolic element in Boeotian. To the latter are referred the remaining
11469,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"dialects, i.e. the Doric dialects and all the dialects of the mainland"
11470,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"of Greece except Arcadian, Attic, Thessalian and Boeotian, so far as"
11471,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Boeotian can be regarded as Aeolic. It may be doubted whether this
11472,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"classification is altogether satisfactory, since the affinities of"
11473,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Aeolic with Ionic and Arcadian are by no means close; as much perhaps
11474,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,might be said for a division into 'North Greek' (Aeolic) and 'South
11475,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Greek' (non-Aeolic). But there can be no doubt that the 'West Greek'
11476,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"dialects, i.e. Doric and north-western Greek, except perhaps Elean, do"
11477,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,really form a homogeneous group. Indeed it can hardly be maintained
11478,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that the Doric dialects as a whole show any divergence from the other
11479,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"members of the group[438], though there are marked differences between"
11480,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,one Doric dialect and another. It is this West Greek group which
11481,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"specially requires our attention, for according to all the evidence we"
11482,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,possess it included the dialects of both the Phthiotic Achaeans and the
11483,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Peloponnesian Achaeans.
11484,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11485,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Now let us return to the genealogical problem. We have seen that
11486,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Herodotus was familiar with a story which traced the descent of the
11487,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Peloponnesian Achaeans from Phthios the son of Achaios. The same writer
11488,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"elsewhere (I 56, etc.) draws a distinction between 'Hellenic' and"
11489,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,'Pelasgian' peoples. Among the former he includes the Dorians; among
11490,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the latter the Athenians (I 56, VIII 44), the Ionians (VII 94), the"
11491,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Arcadians (I 146) and the Aeolians (VII 95). By Αἰολέες he means here
11492,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the inhabitants of the Asiatic Aeolis. But in view of other passages (I
11493,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"57, VII 176) it can scarcely be doubted that he would have included the"
11494,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,earlier population of Thessaly in the same category.
11495,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11496,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Now Herodotus himself believed the Pelasgoi to have been a barbarous
11497,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,nation. The peoples of whom he is speaking here were regarded by
11498,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,him as 'Hellenized' Pelasgoi. Some modern writers think that he was
11499,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"mistaken in this view, and that the Pelasgoi were a Greek people from"
11500,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the beginning[439]. Some hold also that the term Πελασγοί in most of
11501,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,these cases is due simply to the influence of genealogies[440]. It is
11502,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,a serious objection to this latter view that the well-known genealogy
11503,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"in which the descent of Ion, as well as Aiolos, is traced from Hellen,"
11504,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,goes back at least two or three centuries before the time of Herodotus.
11505,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,But we are not primarily concerned here with Herodotus' opinions;
11506,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,for it is clear from the expressions which he uses (e.g. VII 95: τὸ
11507,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"πάλαι καλεόμενοι Πελασγοὶ, ὡς Ἑλλήνων λόγος) that the distinction"
11508,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,between Πελασγοί and Ἕλληνες was one which was generally recognised in
11509,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,his time. Some of his contemporaries may have regarded the Pelasgoi
11510,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"as Greeks, others as barbarians. What was generally agreed was that"
11511,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the term Ἕλληνες was originally applied only to a portion of the
11512,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"inhabitants of Greece. We may refer to Thucydides (I 3[441]): ""The"
11513,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"different tribes, of which the Pelasgian was the most widely spread,"
11514,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,gave their own names to different districts. But when Hellen and his
11515,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"sons became powerful in Phthiotis, their aid was invoked by other"
11516,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"cities, and those who were associated with them gradually began to be"
11517,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"called Hellenes, though a long time elapsed before the name prevailed"
11518,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,over the whole country. Of this Homer affords the best evidence;
11519,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"for he, although he lived long after the Trojan War, nowhere uses"
11520,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"this name collectively, but confines it to the followers of Achilles"
11521,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"from Phthiotis, who were the original Hellenes."" In a certain sense"
11522,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"therefore we may regard Πελασγοί as a term of negative value, i.e."
11523,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,'non-Hellenic.'
11524,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11525,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Herodotus does not expressly describe any people as 'Hellenic,' in the"
11526,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"narrower sense, except the Dorians. But we are surely not justified"
11527,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in concluding from this that he regarded the Dorians as the only true
11528,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Hellenes[442]. He is interested in pointing out that certain Greek
11529,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,(Hellenic) peoples were believed to be of Pelasgian origin. Doubtless
11530,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,he considered it unnecessary to say that those for whom no such origin
11531,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"was claimed were really Hellenes, except in such a passage as I 56,"
11532,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,where a 'Hellenic' and a 'Pelasgian' people are specially contrasted
11533,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,with each other. In general then the presumption is rather that a
11534,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"people was believed to be truly Hellenic, unless we have a statement to"
11535,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the contrary. In particular however it is incredible that the Achaeans
11536,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"were regarded as Pelasgian, for it was in the Achaean Phthiotis--more"
11537,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,properly perhaps in 'Phthia'--that traditional belief located the
11538,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"eponymous Hellen. Thucydides, as we have seen, observes that this"
11539,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,belief was confirmed by the evidence of the Homeric poems. The term
11540,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,'Hellenic' belongs essentially to the followers of Achilles (οἵπερ καὶ
11541,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,πρῶτοι Ἕλληνες ἦσαν).
11542,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11543,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,It can hardly be contended either that the story of Hellen is derived
11544,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"from the Homeric usage, or that the Homeric usage is derived from"
11545,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the story of Hellen. Both alike are based on the common knowledge or
11546,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,belief that the names Ἕλληνες and Ἑλλάς belonged originally to Phthia.
11547,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"It is not difficult to see why names from such a district, obscure"
11548,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"and remote as it was, should come to be applied to the whole nation."
11549,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,The valley of the Spercheios was regarded as the gate of Greece.
11550,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Certain peoples, such as the Boeotians and Eleans, may have come into"
11551,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,possession of their territories by maritime invasions. But there can
11552,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"be little doubt that in prehistoric, as in historical times--we may"
11553,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,refer to the Persians and the Gauls--great invasions usually made
11554,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,their way through the pass of Thermopylai. That is true probably not
11555,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"only of the later invasions of the 'West Greek' peoples (the Achaeans,"
11556,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Locrians, Dorians, etc.) but also of those much earlier movements by"
11557,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,which the first Greek populations--the ancestors of the Ionians and
11558,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Arcadians--were introduced into the peninsula. But if we are to trust
11559,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,all the evidence at our disposal it was with the later movements that
11560,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the names Ἑλλάς[443] and Ἕλληνες[444] were originally connected.
11561,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11562,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,The results of our discussion may now be summarised as follows: (i)
11563,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,According to current hypotheses the language of the Achaeans of
11564,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Phthiotis was Aeolic, while that of the Peloponnesian Achaeans was"
11565,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,perhaps Arcadian; but in point of fact all the linguistic evidence
11566,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,which we have from both districts (including the colonies of the
11567,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Peloponnesian Achaeans) is definitely West Greek. In all probability
11568,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the valley of the Spercheios was one of the first, if not actually the"
11569,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"very first, of the districts occupied by the West Greeks in the eastern"
11570,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,and southern parts of the peninsula. (ii) According to a belief current
11571,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"in the fifth century certain Greek peoples were truly 'Hellenic,' while"
11572,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"others were of 'Pelasgian' origin. The former category coincided,"
11573,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"at least to a large extent, with the 'West Greek' linguistic"
11574,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"division, the latter with the 'East Greek' division, or--to speak"
11575,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"more accurately--with the northern, eastern and southern groups of"
11576,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"dialects. In certain cases, owing to the silence of our authorities, it"
11577,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,may be permissible to doubt whether a people was regarded as 'Hellenic'
11578,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"or 'Pelasgian'; but no such doubt applies to the followers of Achilles,"
11579,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,'who were the original Hellenes.' It was in Phthia that much earlier
11580,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,tradition located the eponymous Hellen; and from the same district
11581,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"came Archandros and Architeles, the legendary progenitors of the"
11582,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Peloponnesian Achaeans, several generations before the Trojan War. It"
11583,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,is clear then that the 'West Greek' language of the extant inscriptions
11584,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,is in perfect agreement with the belief of the fifth century Greeks
11585,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that this community was essentially Hellenic. We may dismiss therefore
11586,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,as totally without foundation the hypothesis that Achilles was an
11587,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Aeolic (or Pelasgian) hero[445].
11588,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11589,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Now let us drop hypotheses and consider briefly the evidence actually
11590,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,furnished by the Iliad. The poem leaves us in no doubt as to who are
11591,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,regarded as the principal persons in the Achaean army. In II 404 ff.
11592,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Agamemnon is represented as calling together ""the elders, the chiefs of"
11593,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the whole Achaean host"" (γέροντας ἀριστῆας Παναχαιῶν). They are Nestor,"
11594,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Idomeneus, Aias the son of Telamon and his Locrian namesake, Diomedes,"
11595,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Odysseus and Menelaos. In another council (X 194 ff.) we find the same
11596,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"party together with three additional persons, Thrasymedes, Meriones and"
11597,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Meges. In the debates, which occur so frequently, the leading speakers"
11598,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"are almost always Agamemnon, Nestor, Diomedes, Odysseus and Menelaos."
11599,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,In the battle scenes the aged Nestor naturally does not play an active
11600,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"part. The other four heroes however, together with Idomeneus, Aias the"
11601,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"son of Telamon and (to a somewhat less extent) the Locrian Aias, are by"
11602,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,far the most conspicuous figures in the army. In response to Hector's
11603,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"challenge, from which Menelaos has been forced to retire, all the other"
11604,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"six come forward, together with Meriones, Eurypylos and Thoas. There"
11605,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,can be no doubt then that the eight leading men are Agamemnon and his
11606,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"brother, Nestor, Idomeneus, the two Aiantes, Diomedes and Odysseus. To"
11607,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"these we must certainly add Achilles, who is in retirement throughout"
11608,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the greater part of the poem.

11634,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11635,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Hypothesis after hypothesis has been tried in order to claim an Aeolic
11636,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,or Ionic origin for most of these heroes. The plain fact is that all
11637,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,except one[446] belong to communities which in the fifth century were
11638,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,regarded as truly 'Hellenic'--or at all events to districts where
11639,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,dialects of the West Greek type prevailed in historical times. The
11640,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"leading Aeolic hero is Eurypylos; but he ranks only with Meriones, the"
11641,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Cretan second-in-command, Thoas the Aetolian and Nestor's sons. The"
11642,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,other Aeolic and Ionic leaders are distinctly less prominent.
11643,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11644,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"From the evidence at our disposal it seems to me that, if the poets"
11645,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"of the Iliad, or rather their predecessors, were interested in any"
11646,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"nationality at all, that nationality must have been West Greek or"
11647,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"'Hellenic.' Of the two chief leaders one belongs to Achaia Phthiotis,"
11648,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the other to the Peloponnesian Achaeans; the Catalogue of Ships (Il.
11649,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,II 569 ff.) assigns to him territories which in the main coincide
11650,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"with the later Achaia, though they cover a somewhat larger area. We"
11651,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,have scarcely any evidence worth consideration that either Achaia
11652,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Phthiotis or the Peloponnesian Achaia was ever held by a different
11653,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,nationality within the period embraced by history and tradition[447].
11654,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,The territories of the other chief Peloponnesian leaders were occupied
11655,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in historical times by the Dorians. But it was the unanimous belief of
11656,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the ancient world that the Dorian period had been preceded by an age
11657,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"of Achaean domination in the east, south and west of the peninsula."
11658,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Lastly, the Odyssey (XIX 175), in a passage which is commonly believed"
11659,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"to preserve a true ethnographical record, speaks of the presence"
11660,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of Achaeans in Crete. Thus at least six[448] of the nine principal
11661,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,leaders come from regions with an Achaean population. In view of this
11662,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,fact is it any wonder that Ἀχαιοί is by far the commonest term applied
11663,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in the poems to the Greeks collectively[449]? This then must be the
11664,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,nationality in which the poets were interested. But the Achaeans of
11665,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"historical times, as we have seen, everywhere used a form of language"
11666,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"which is West Greek. Moreover, it is to the northern Achaeans that we"
11667,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,first find the name Ἕλληνες applied (Il. II 684). The facts noted seem
11668,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to indicate that the Achaeans were the dominant people of the West
11669,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Greeks--indeed, we may say, of the Greeks generally--during the Heroic"
11670,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Age, a position in which they were eventually succeeded by the Dorians."
11671,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
11672,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,But the poems themselves are of Aeolic origin. It is this
11673,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"fact--supported by speculations of writers of the Roman period, who"
11674,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"included under the term 'Aeolic' every dialect not obviously Doric,"
11675,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Ionic or Attic[450]--which has led to the unfortunate equation
11676,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,'Achaean' = 'Aeolic.' In reality the heroes and the poems belong to
11677,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,two entirely different sections of the Greek nation. Shall we then set
11678,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,up another hypothesis--that the original poems were Achaean? But then
11679,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,we should only be repeating the old error of building hypothesis upon
11680,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"hypothesis. For it is a hypothesis, and nothing more, that the original"
11681,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,poems were concerned with tribal or national interests; the poems which
11682,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,have come down to us deal with the fortunes of individuals. Moreover
11683,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,we should not thereby save the theory that the Iliad is a reflection
11684,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of the Greek settlement of the north-western coast of Asia Minor; for
11685,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that settlement was not Achaean but Aeolic. The truth is that the
11686,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,initial hypothesis is entirely unjustified. We have no more reason for
11687,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,supposing that the heroes must be Aeolic if the poems are Aeolic--or
11688,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that the poems must be Achaean if the heroes are Achaean--than we have
11689,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,for assuming that the Anglo-Saxon poems were of Danish or Gothic origin
11690,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,because Danes and Goths figure in them more prominently than persons
11691,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of English nationality. It is likely enough that poems once existed
11692,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"dealing with Aeolic heroes, such as Iason, perhaps also Peirithoos and"
11693,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"others. But the reason for the prominence assigned to Achaean heroes,"
11694,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"at all events in the poems which have survived, is to be found not in"
11695,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the national sympathies or interests of the poets, but in the fact that"
11696,MYTH IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,during the Heroic Age the Achaeans were the dominant people in Greece.

11796,FOOTNOTES:,[422] It must be clearly understood that I am using the term 'Aeolic'
11797,FOOTNOTES:,in the modern (linguistic) sense. I am under the impression that Prof.
11798,FOOTNOTES:,"Cauer uses the term in the same sense. The only difference, so far as"
11799,FOOTNOTES:,"I can see, between his terminology and mine is that--in accordance,"
11800,FOOTNOTES:,"I think, with general usage--I would include Boeotian as well as"
11801,FOOTNOTES:,Thessalian and Lesbian-Aeolic in this category. Some ancient writers of
11802,FOOTNOTES:,course use the terms Αἰολεῖς and Αἰολίς in a totally different sense.
11803,FOOTNOTES:,Thus Thucydides (III 102) applies the name Αἰολίς to the district
11804,FOOTNOTES:,"about Pleuron and Calydon, and again (IV 42) he speaks of the ancient"
11805,FOOTNOTES:,inhabitants of Corinth as Αἰολῆς. There may be some difference of
11806,FOOTNOTES:,opinion as to whether the use of these names in such cases is due to
11807,FOOTNOTES:,the influence of genealogies--in the former case through Aethlios and
11808,FOOTNOTES:,"Endymion, in the latter through Sisyphos--or whether the genealogies"
11809,FOOTNOTES:,"themselves are due to a current use of the names Αἰολεῖς, Αἰολίς, etc."
11810,FOOTNOTES:,"The form Αἰολίδης in Il. VI 154, Od. XI 237 rather suggests that these"
11811,FOOTNOTES:,names may have belonged to a family (or possibly a clan) before they
11812,FOOTNOTES:,came to be applied to a people; but into this question we need not
11813,FOOTNOTES:,enter. The term 'Aeolic' (in its linguistic sense) belongs properly to
11814,FOOTNOTES:,"the Asiatic Aeolis, and this name itself is derived in all probability"
11815,FOOTNOTES:,"from the Thessalian Aeolis (cf. Herod. VII 176), the fatherland of the"
11816,FOOTNOTES:,Asiatic Aeolians. There may possibly have been some connection between
11817,FOOTNOTES:,"the reigning families of the Thessalian Aeolis and those at Calydon,"
11818,FOOTNOTES:,Corinth and elsewhere which claimed descent from Aiolos; but there is
11819,FOOTNOTES:,not the slightest evidence that an Aeolic dialect (in the modern sense)
11820,FOOTNOTES:,was ever spoken at either Calydon or Corinth. It may be added that
11821,FOOTNOTES:,nothing but confusion of thought can arise from introducing into this
11822,FOOTNOTES:,discussion the terminology of writers of the Roman age (cf. especially
11823,FOOTNOTES:,"Strabo VIII 1. 2), who apply the name 'Aeolic' to every dialect which"

11847,FOOTNOTES:,"suggest a connection between this name and Ἄργος. But if so, it is more"

11868,FOOTNOTES:,Thessalian (Aeolic) characteristics in the proportion of about 7:3 (or

11870,FOOTNOTES:,of the hypothesis that the introduction of north-western Greek into
11871,FOOTNOTES:,this region was due to the influence of the Aetolian League. Even the

11881,FOOTNOTES:,
11882,FOOTNOTES:,"[432] According to the generally accepted view, which there seems to"

11885,FOOTNOTES:,"population. The name 'Thessalian' however, properly speaking, belonged"

11887,FOOTNOTES:,
11888,FOOTNOTES:,[433] Strabo (VIII 5. 5) likewise connects the Peloponnesian Achaeans
11889,FOOTNOTES:,with Phthiotis; but he attributes their settlement in the Peloponnesos
11890,FOOTNOTES:,to an invasion by Pelops. In this passage (as in many others) it is
11891,FOOTNOTES:,greatly to be questioned whether Strabo (or the authority whom he
11892,FOOTNOTES:,followed) was recording genuine tradition--whether he was not rather
11893,FOOTNOTES:,endeavouring to provide an explanation of the traditions.
11894,FOOTNOTES:,
11895,FOOTNOTES:,[434] The inscriptions are late; but their evidence as to the
11896,FOOTNOTES:,general character of the dialect is confirmed by some short but
11897,FOOTNOTES:,early inscriptions from the Achaean settlements in Italy. It is
11898,FOOTNOTES:,assumed by many scholars that Arcadian was the original language of
11899,FOOTNOTES:,the Peloponnesian Achaeans; but I am not aware that any evidence
11900,FOOTNOTES:,worth consideration has been adduced in support of this view. No
11901,FOOTNOTES:,"ancient authorities, so far as I know, connect the Arcadians with the"
11902,FOOTNOTES:,"Achaeans, nor do the Arcadians themselves appear to have claimed such a"
11903,FOOTNOTES:,connection.
11904,FOOTNOTES:,
11905,FOOTNOTES:,[435] This theory is of course quite distinct from the theory which
11906,FOOTNOTES:,traces the language of the Phthiotic inscriptions to the influence of
11907,FOOTNOTES:,the Aetolian League. The two are scarcely reconcilable if it be held
11908,FOOTNOTES:,that the Locrians and Phocians came from the north-west; for in that
11909,FOOTNOTES:,"case their route must have lain through the valley of the Spercheios,"
11910,FOOTNOTES:,a district which would not readily be neglected by peoples seeking new

11912,FOOTNOTES:,
11913,FOOTNOTES:,[436] I.e. in times subsequent to the Heroic Age. I do not mean
11914,FOOTNOTES:,of course to suggest that the north-west Greek dialects belonged
11915,FOOTNOTES:,originally to these districts; but I see no reason for supposing
11916,FOOTNOTES:,that the previous language was Aeolic. The Ainianes may have moved
11917,FOOTNOTES:,southwards later. But the language of their inscriptions (at Hypate)
11918,FOOTNOTES:,is indistinguishable from that of the surrounding peoples. It is to be

11920,FOOTNOTES:,themselves had come from a district within this area.
11921,FOOTNOTES:,
11922,FOOTNOTES:,[437] It may be added that the fertile plains of Boeotia are more

11965,FOOTNOTES:,
11966,FOOTNOTES:,[445] It is scarcely necessary to notice the subsidiary arguments which
11967,FOOTNOTES:,have been adduced in favour of the hypothesis--e.g. that Achilles had

11969,FOOTNOTES:,from Pelion. They are sufficiently accounted for by the fact that the
11970,FOOTNOTES:,poems are of Aeolic origin. The suggestion that Peleus himself is the
11971,FOOTNOTES:,eponymus of Pelion belongs to a class which has been sufficiently
11972,FOOTNOTES:,discussed above (p. 267 ff.).
11973,FOOTNOTES:,
11974,FOOTNOTES:,[446] The exceptional case is that of Aias the son of Telamon. But we
11975,FOOTNOTES:,have no information relating to Salamis before its conquest by the

11979,FOOTNOTES:,[447] In the case of the Peloponnesian Achaia it is conceivable that
11980,FOOTNOTES:,a genuine tradition of a conquest of earlier (Ionic) inhabitants may

11982,FOOTNOTES:,connected with the Dorian invasion can hardly be due to anything but
11983,FOOTNOTES:,'combination'; and traces of such a process can be distinguished
11984,FOOTNOTES:,plainly enough in Herodotus' account. The important fact is that the
11985,FOOTNOTES:,author of the Catalogue of Ships evidently knew nothing of the story.
11986,FOOTNOTES:,
11987,FOOTNOTES:,[448] We may probably add Odysseus. In the Odyssey the hero's subjects
11988,FOOTNOTES:,are regularly described as Ἀχαιοί. They are not called Ἀργεῖοι or
11989,FOOTNOTES:,"Δαναοί, although the three names are used interchangeably as collective"
11990,FOOTNOTES:,terms for the Greek army before Troy. Regarding the national affinities
11991,FOOTNOTES:,of the inhabitants of the Ionian Isles in later times we have little
11992,FOOTNOTES:,information; but the language was clearly of the 'north-west Greek'

12010,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"conscious, deliberate invention, was permitted in the composition of"
12011,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Greek heroic poetry. This question gave us considerable difficulty
12012,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,when we were discussing the Teutonic poems. It is assuredly not less
12013,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,difficult here. The higher artistic level of the Greek poems cannot but
12014,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,pre-dispose us in favour of the view that their use of fiction is of a
12015,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,more advanced type. This expectation is fully realised in the elaborate
12016,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"presentation of many of the scenes, whether the actors be human beings"
12017,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"who may or may not have taken part in the events described, or divine"
12018,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,beings whose mythical origin no one will dispute. In the σύστασις τῶν
12019,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,πραγμάτων the art of poetic invention is developed to a high degree of
12020,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,perfection.
12021,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
12022,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,The chief difference between our present problem and the one which
12023,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,we had to consider in Chapter VIII lies in the fact that here we are
12024,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,entirely without that contemporary historical evidence which enables
12025,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,us to recognise some characters or events in nearly all the Teutonic
12026,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,poems. The way lies open therefore for regarding the whole story of
12027,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the siege of Troy as a product of fiction; and this is a view which
12028,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,many modern scholars have adopted. For an example we can scarcely do
12029,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,better than quote the words of the late Sir R. C. Jebb (_Introduction
12030,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"to Homer_, p. 147): ""The tale of Troy, as we have it in Homer, is"
12031,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"essentially a poetic creation; and the poet is the sole witness."""
12032,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"The same scholar was prepared to grant that ""some memorable capture"
12033,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"of a town in the Troad had probably been made by Greek warriors"";"
12034,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"but, he adds, ""beyond this we cannot safely go."" This attitude is"
12035,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,doubtless perfectly correct from the historian's point of view. But
12036,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,if we approach the problem from the ethnologist's side we cannot
12037,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,rest satisfied with an attitude of scepticism owing to the absence
12038,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of historical evidence. Our duty includes the question how far we
12039,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,are justified in admitting the use of fiction. The Iliad would still
12040,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,be a great monument of human genius even if all the characters and
12041,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"events in it could be proved to be historical. But if it is wholly, or"
12042,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"almost wholly, a work of fiction we shall have to conclude that the"
12043,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Homeric poets had developed the inventive faculty to a degree which has
12044,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,scarcely been equalled even in our own days. That is a conclusion which
12045,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"we shall do well to adopt only after careful consideration, seeing"
12046,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that we are dealing with the earliest monument of European literature.
12047,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Scepticism is required in this direction therefore just as much as in
12048,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the other.
12049,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
12050,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,At the outset we are confronted by two considerations which amply
12051,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,justify this attitude. The first is the evidence of the Teutonic poems.
12052,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Here, as we have seen, myth and folk-tale both play their parts, the"
12053,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,latter often a very important part. But we have no proof that any one
12054,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of the stories is a product of conscious fiction. Wherever we can
12055,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"put it to the test, the setting is found to be historical, at least"
12056,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in the earlier forms of the stories. In medieval poetry we meet with
12057,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"many fictitious stories of wars waged by imaginary kings of, let us"
12058,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"say, Byzantium or Britain. But in poetry which is entirely free from"
12059,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"scholastic influence, such as the old heroic poems or the poems of the"
12060,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Viking Age, we shall look in vain for trustworthy examples. The same"
12061,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,remark is probably true of Slavonic and Cumbrian heroic poetry.
12062,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
12063,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,The other consideration is still more serious. It is the opinion of the
12064,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,ancient Greeks themselves. Here again we may quote Sir R. C. Jebb's
12065,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"work (p. 84): ""They held that his events and his persons were, in the"
12066,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"main, real.... Thucydides differs from Herodotus in bringing down the"
12067,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Homeric heroes more nearly to the level of common men. But the basis
12068,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"of fact in Homer is fully as real to Thucydides as to Herodotus."" The"
12069,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"current hypothesis assumes that both were deceived, and with them"
12070,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the universal consensus of educated Greek opinion. But is not this a
12071,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,strange assumption? Those who hold that the Homeric poems are wholly
12072,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the work of one author may cherish the belief that this person was so
12073,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,gifted as to be able to perpetrate a hoax upon his countrymen which
12074,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in their most enlightened days they never succeeded in detecting.
12075,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,But I do not see how any such idea can be reconciled with the theory
12076,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"of evolution. The story was invented, we must presume, by the first"
12077,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,poet and elaborated by his successors. Were these latter persons
12078,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"cognisant of the deception? If not, we must regard their contributions"
12079,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,as negligible; and consequently we are brought back virtually to the
12080,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,theory of single authorship. And yet no one will suggest that the
12081,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,poets of several generations were accomplices in such a deception. The
12082,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"only alternative then, which remains, is that the poets invented and"
12083,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"elaborated a romance, which they did not intend to be taken seriously."
12084,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,How greatly then has the history of Greek thought been misunderstood!
12085,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,It appears now that the period between the ninth and the fifth
12086,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,centuries was characterised not by intellectual emancipation but by the
12087,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,growth of credulity.
12088,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
12089,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,In view of these considerations the burden of proof must be held to lie
12090,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,with those who hold that the story is fictitious. Until such proof is
12091,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,forthcoming it seems to me that the only reasonable course is to follow
12092,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the opinion of the ancients, except in so far as we have good reason"
12093,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,for believing that they were mistaken. The ancients not only accepted
12094,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the siege of Troy as a historical fact; they were prepared also to
12095,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,point out the site of the city. The correctness of this identification
12096,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"was indeed disputed by Demetrios of Scepsis, a native antiquary of"
12097,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the second century, who fixed upon another site, some four miles"
12098,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,away; while modern scholars until recently believed that both were
12099,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,wrong. This is why in the passage quoted above Sir R. C. Jebb used the
12100,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"expression ""a city in the Troad."" But about five or six years after the"
12101,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,publication of his book the traditional site was fully vindicated by
12102,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the excavations of Dr Dörpfeld, which brought to light the remains of"
12103,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"a fortress dating, approximately at least, from the period indicated"
12104,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,by the story. It was made clear also that this fortress had been
12105,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"destroyed, presumably by enemies. That the destroyers were Greeks"
12106,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,could not of course be proved by the excavations. But the evidence of
12107,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the poems in this respect is confirmed by the fact that the district
12108,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,was inhabited by Greeks in later times[451].
12109,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
12110,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,It is held by many scholars that the story of the siege of Troy is a
12111,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,reflection of the Aeolic colonisation of the Asiatic coast. We have
12112,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,already discussed the principle underlying this theory and found no
12113,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,evidence in its favour. But it does not follow from this that the two
12114,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,events were unconnected. One of the most famous stories[452] recorded
12115,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,by Scandinavian tradition is that of the expedition to England which
12116,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,was undertaken by the sons of Lothbrok for the purpose of exacting
12117,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,vengeance for their father's death. Now we have an account of this
12118,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"invasion from a contemporary historical work (the Saxon Chronicle),"
12119,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"which gives the names of two of the princes (Inwaer and Healfdene),"
12120,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,as well as that of the Northumbrian king Aella against whom the
12121,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,expedition was directed. We know also that Lothbrok's sons were by
12122,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,no means contented with the overthrow of Aella; that on the contrary
12123,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,they ravaged the greater part of England. Long after they were all
12124,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,dead or departed the eastern half of the country remained Scandinavian
12125,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,territory. According to the Iliad Achilles did not confine his energies
12126,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to Troy; he is said to have ravaged Lesbos and several places in the
12127,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,country round the Gulf of Adramyttion. Is there any valid reason for
12128,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,denying that the Greek occupation of these lands may have originated
12129,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in such events? We need not suppose of course that the conquered lands
12130,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,were fully occupied at once. But the first settlers may well have
12131,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,secured enough to serve as a refuge for those of their countrymen who
12132,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"fled from the Thessalian invasion, probably no long time afterwards."
12133,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,A good parallel is furnished by the Scandinavian settlements in the
12134,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"British Isles, which served as a retreat for many Norwegians who"
12135,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,refused to bow to the encroachments of Harold the Fair-haired.
12136,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
12137,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"The Greek settlements in this region were Aeolic, a fact due probably,"
12138,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"as we have said, to the Thessalian invasion. But Achilles was an"
12139,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Achaean, and the same is true of most of the other chief heroes. The"
12140,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Iliad does not represent Troy as being attacked merely 'by Greeks,' but"
12141,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,by an army gathered together from nearly all parts of Greece. This is
12142,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,one of the features in the story to which objection has been taken most
12143,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,generally. We may grant freely that no parallel for such an undertaking
12144,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"is to be found in historical times. Indeed, the objection itself"
12145,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,contains a weak point here; for from all that we know of the earliest
12146,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,historical period it is scarcely credible that such an idea could have
12147,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"suggested itself, even in a work of fiction. On the other hand in the"
12148,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"thirteenth and twelfth centuries the monuments of Rameses II, Merenptah"
12149,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,and Rameses III give us information of expeditions which were on at
12150,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,least as large a scale and covered much greater distances. We have no
12151,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,reason for doubting that such an undertaking was possible also in the
12152,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,eleventh century.
12153,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
12154,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"But if the expedition itself is nothing incredible in such a period,"
12155,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,what shall we say with regard to its motive? The reason assigned by the
12156,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,poem--that it was brought about by Paris' escapade--is one of those
12157,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,features which have been put aside by modern scholars as unworthy of
12158,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,consideration. This attitude is due partly to the application of modern
12159,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,political theories to a state of society in which they are quite out
12160,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of place. With this question we shall have to deal in the following
12161,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,chapter. But it is due still more to the absurd hallucination that a
12162,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,story of abduction must have originated in the 'hypostasis' of natural
12163,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,phenomena. According to Scandinavian tradition the expedition of
12164,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Lothbrok's sons was inspired by a purely personal motive--the desire to
12165,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,exact vengeance for their father's death. But in the Heroic Age itself
12166,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,we have from a strictly contemporary authority (cf. p. 97 f.) the story
12167,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"of the great expedition of the Angli against the Warni, which was"
12168,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,caused by a breach of promise of marriage.
12169,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
12170,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"It appears then on examination that the central feature of the story,"
12171,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"namely the destruction of Troy, rests upon fact, while the other main"
12172,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,features gain in probability the more one takes into account the
12173,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,conditions of the age and the analogies furnished by similar stories
12174,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,elsewhere. These considerations tend to support the view that the
12175,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,employment of fiction is to be seen rather in the presentation than in
12176,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the conception of the story. But the term 'presentation' here, just as"
12177,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"in Chapter VIII, must be interpreted in a very liberal sense."
12178,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
12179,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,What has been said above applies of course properly only to the Iliad.
12180,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,With the Odyssey the case is quite otherwise. In the first place we
12181,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,have to note that the ancients themselves took a different view with
12182,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,regard to this poem--at all events that part of it which relates to
12183,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the hero's wanderings. The credibility of the various incidents was
12184,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,frequently and warmly debated; but many of them were defended only by
12185,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,an allegorical interpretation. Then again the conditions are similar
12186,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to those in which we find the most pronounced use of fiction in early
12187,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Teutonic poetry. Sigemund is expressly said to have been alone when
12188,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"he attacked the dragon, and most of Beowulf's marvellous exploits are"
12189,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,performed when he is either alone or with a single companion. The motif
12190,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of the lonely wanderer in distant lands is not prominent in the remains
12191,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"of our poetry, but from what is said of Sigemund in Beow. 876 ff. we"
12192,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,can scarcely doubt that it would have been utilised for the exercise of
12193,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the inventive faculty.
12194,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
12195,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Now we have seen (p. 258 ff.) that the hero's narrative in Od. IX-XII
12196,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,is evidently derived from an accumulation of folk-tales. Here the art
12197,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of fiction is shown chiefly in the poet's adaptation of this material
12198,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to his own purpose. But there are other parts of the poem--notably the
12199,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,preceding three books (VI-VIII)--which obviously require a different
12200,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,explanation. It is frequently assumed that the Phaeacians are wholly a
12201,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,creation of the poet's fancy. Without going so far as this[453] we may
12202,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,seriously doubt whether they were a Greek people and whether there was
12203,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,any foundation in history or tradition for the account given here--with
12204,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"a quite exceptional amount of detail--of their princes, their city and"
12205,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,institutions. If this part of the story is to be regarded as fiction
12206,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,it is certainly a more elaborate type of fiction than anything which
12207,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,we meet with in the early heroic poetry of the Teutonic peoples. But
12208,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the false stories told by Odysseus in the latter part of the poem at
12209,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,all events go far towards showing that such fiction was not beyond the
12210,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,power of Homeric poets.
12211,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
12212,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,According to our explanation the extensive use of fiction in the story
12213,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of Odysseus is due to the fact that in this case the poet or poets
12214,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"had a free hand, whereas elsewhere, more particularly in the Iliad,"
12215,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,they were bound down by tradition. It is not to be overlooked however
12216,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that the Iliad itself contains many incidents which may similarly be
12217,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,regarded as products of invention--additions to the story which did
12218,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,not conflict with anything that had been 'handed down.' As a likely
12219,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,instance of this kind we may cite the Doloneia. But since we can seldom
12220,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"or never get beyond a hypothesis with such cases, it will be more"
12221,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"profitable, I think, now to turn our attention to another question,"
12222,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,namely whether the use of fiction also included the invention of
12223,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,characters--and if so to what extent.
12224,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
12225,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,In our consideration of the Teutonic stories we came to the conclusion
12226,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that there was no really satisfactory evidence for such invention. In
12227,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the Homeric poems the evidence is much stronger. We will first take the
12228,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,case of names which appear to have been coined with an obvious meaning.
12229,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"A good example occurs in Od. VIII 111 ff., where the Phaeacian"
12230,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,athletes are enumerated:
12231,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
12232,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,ὦρτο μὲν Ἀκρόνεώς τε καὶ Ὠκύαλος καὶ Ἐλατρεὺς
12233,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Ναυτεύς τε Πρυμνεύς τε καὶ Ἀγχίαλος καὶ Ἐρετμεὺς
12234,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Ποντεύς τε Πρωρεύς τε, Θόων Ἀναβησίνεώς τε"
12235,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Ἀμφίαλός θ' υἱὸς Πολυνήου Τεκτονίδαο·
12236,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"ἂν δὲ καὶ Εὐρύαλος βροτολοιγῷ ἶσος Ἄρηι,"
12237,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Ναυβολίδης θ', κ.τ.λ."
12238,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
12239,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Other Phaeacians have names of the same type, e.g. Ναυσίθοος,"
12240,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Ναυσικάα, Ἅλιος, Κλυτόνηος, Ἐχένηος, Ποντόνοος. In such a case as"
12241,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,this the poet can scarcely have intended to deceive his audience.
12242,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Indeed the principle is clearly admitted in another passage (XXIV
12243,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"305), where Odysseus in a false story describes himself as υἱὸς"
12244,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Ἀφείδαντος Πολυπημονίδαο ἄνακτος. We need not doubt then that other
12245,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"names are constructed on the same plan, e.g. that of the minstrel,"
12246,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Φήμιος Τερπιάδης, perhaps also those of the shipowner, Νοήμων son of"
12247,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Φρόνιος, and Menelaos' pilot, Φρόντις Ὀνητορίδης. Similar cases may"
12248,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"be found also in the Iliad[454], e.g. (V 59 ff.) Φέρεκλον ... Τέκτονος"
12249,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"υἱὸν Ἁρμονίδεω, ὃς χερσὶν ἐπίστατο δαίδαλα πάντα τεύχειν, or the name"
12250,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"of a Trojan herald (XVII 323 f.) Περίφαντι Ἠπυτίδῃ, probably also the"
12251,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,spy Δόλων Εὐμήδεος υἱός (X 314). This list of course makes no claim to
12252,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,be exhaustive. But on the whole it can hardly be said that the type
12253,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"is really common in either poem, except the section dealing with the"
12254,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Phaeacians.
12255,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
12256,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,It is far more difficult to form an opinion with regard to the origin
12257,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of characters whose names bear no such obvious mark. Few probably would
12258,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,be inclined to doubt that the names of Helen's handmaidens (Od. IV
12259,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,123 ff.) were coined by the poet. But what shall we say with regard
12260,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"to the suitors of Penelope[455]? The argument may not be a sound one,"
12261,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,but it is not easy to see under what conditions historical names could
12262,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"have been preserved in such a connection. And again, what about the"
12263,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,numerous names which figure in the ἀνδροκτασίαι? Even though many of
12264,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the names do recur again and again, their number is surprising[456]. It"
12265,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,is difficult to doubt that the poets gave free rein to their inventive
12266,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,faculties in such scenes.
12267,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
12268,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,But what limits are we to set to this process? If we regard the chief
12269,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,heroes themselves as products of fiction we shall be involved in much
12270,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the same difficulties as if we interpreted the story as a whole in this
12271,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,way. In a sense indeed the difficulties will be increased; for it is
12272,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,scarcely conceivable that a heroic story should come into existence
12273,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,without heroes[457]. No one can reasonably doubt that the list of
12274,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Phaeacian athletes is the invention of one man[458]. In the case
12275,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of Penelope's suitors this is not so clear. Yet personally I cannot
12276,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"understand the Odyssey if it is not, in its present form, largely the"
12277,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"work of an individual brain, however much it may have utilised and even"
12278,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,incorporated older matter. This 'redactor' or 'author' or whatever he
12279,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,may be called may well have invented the names of most of the suitors;
12280,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,they are not essential to the story. But how can any such explanation
12281,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,be applied to the heroes of the siege of Troy? These were not obscure
12282,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,chieftains in a distant group of islands without external connections.
12283,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Many of them are represented as rulers of what were once certainly
12284,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the chief states in Greece, and they were universally recognised as"
12285,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,historical persons from the earliest times of which we have any record.
12286,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"In some cases they were even honoured with worship, and distinguished"
12287,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"families claimed to be descended from them. Mythical characters, such"
12288,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"as Scyld or Dardanos, may come to be regarded as historical. But these"
12289,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"are products of many minds rather than of one, and of reflection"
12290,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"rather than imagination. Their personification is a gradual process,"
12291,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,and even when it is accomplished they figure only in the background of
12292,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"heroic stories, without any definite individual characterisation. The"
12293,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,hypothesis which we are now testing has no relation to such figures as
12294,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"these--for Agamemnon, Achilles and their companions are not eponymous"
12295,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,heroes. If they are creations of one man's imagination we must ask how
12296,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"this person, however gifted he may have been, succeeded in passing"
12297,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,off his romance as history. On the other hand if they were gradually
12298,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,'evolved' by a succession of poets we must ask at what stage and by
12299,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,what process so great a misunderstanding of their real character
12300,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,originated.
12301,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
12302,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,It is a great assumption that every local record relating to the
12303,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"heroes of the Trojan War owes its origin, directly or indirectly, to"
12304,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the influence of Homeric poetry; and yet that is what is involved
12305,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,by the hypothesis under discussion. There is no doubt that heroic
12306,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,poetry can influence local tradition in an age given to antiquarian
12307,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,speculation; but where shall we find any parallel for such a result as
12308,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,this? Pausanias (II 16. 5) states that the tombs of Agamemnon and his
12309,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,household were to be seen at Mycenae. It is likely enough that in this
12310,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"case the local belief was derived ultimately from the poems, although"
12311,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"it seems to have contained some unorthodox features. But in Pindar,"
12312,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Aeschylus and other early poets we find forms of the story which
12313,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,differ much more widely from the Homeric account. These authorities
12314,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,also give us a good deal of information regarding other members of
12315,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the family, Pelops, Atreus and Orestes--persons who seem not to have"
12316,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,figured prominently in any Homeric poems that we know of. Particularly
12317,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,we should notice that according to Pausanias (III 19. 5) the Spartans
12318,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"also possessed a tomb of Agamemnon (at Amyclai), and that in early"
12319,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,times they appear to have claimed him as one of their own kings. To
12320,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,this we have already referred (p. 240). The problem as a whole is
12321,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,surely one which requires considerably more investigation than it has
12322,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"yet received. But I should be much surprised if such investigations,"
12323,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"carried out in an impartial spirit, did not bring to light many traces"
12324,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"of stories relating to the Heroic Age, which were independent of"
12325,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,anything that we may fairly call 'Homeric' poetry.
12326,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
12327,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Perhaps it may be said that we can safely claim a fictitious origin for
12328,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,some of the leading characters without committing ourselves to the view
12329,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"that all of them were sprung from this source. The case of Agamemnon,"
12330,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"which we have mentioned above, is scarcely one of the most promising."
12331,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"We will now take what is generally regarded as the most certain case,"
12332,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"namely that of Aias[459]. There are two heroes of this name, of whom"
12333,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"one is a Locrian, while the other belongs to Salamis. The theory now"
12334,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,most usually held is that one of the two--preferably the latter--is a
12335,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"fictitious character, derived from the other. This theory rests on the"
12336,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"following arguments: (i) that the two heroes are often found together,"
12337,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"(ii) that Salamis is only mentioned in two passages, (iii) that, apart"
12338,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"from his brother Teucros, the connections of Aias of Salamis are"
12339,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,themselves obviously fictitious. The distinctive characteristic of
12340,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,this Aias is his enormous shield; and this gave birth both to the name
12341,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"of his father Τελαμών ('Strap'), and to that of his son, Εὐρυσάκης"
12342,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,('Broad-shield'). The appropriateness of the latter name is evident
12343,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,enough; but it does not occur in the Homeric poems. The evidence seems
12344,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to indicate that this person is a genealogical creation of much later
12345,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,times--possibly due to the misunderstanding of an epithet. On the other
12346,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,hand the force of the name Τελαμών does not strike me as particularly
12347,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"obvious. Aias' distinguishing characteristic was not his shield-strap,"
12348,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"but the shield itself. Several heroes, Agamemnon, Diomedes and others,"
12349,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,are said to have shield-straps; indeed from Il. II 388 f. we may infer
12350,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"that they were commonly, if not generally, used. Moreover the word"
12351,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,τελαμών does not necessarily mean 'shield-strap'; we find it used
12352,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"also, in several passages, for 'sword-strap.' Its original meaning"
12353,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,appears to have been 'supporter'; and we have no reason for supposing
12354,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"that such a word was inadmissible as a proper name[460]. Again, the"
12355,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,argument that Salamis is only mentioned twice loses its force when
12356,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the general usage of the Iliad is taken into account. Except in three
12357,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,cases--due largely to certain stereotyped formulae--it is not customary
12358,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to refer to the home or nationality of the Achaean leaders[461]. Even
12359,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"if the genuineness of Il. VII 199 be doubted, there can scarcely be"
12360,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,any question that Aias was localised at Salamis by the time when the
12361,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Homeric poems first obtained general currency in Greece; for the
12362,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,post-Homeric (or non-Homeric) genealogy of the Aiacidai and their
12363,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,connection with Aegina go back probably beyond the seventh century.
12364,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,There remains then only the fact that two friends and colleagues have
12365,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the same name. That is doubtless a curious coincidence; but not more
12366,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,curious than many such cases which occur in real life. On the whole I
12367,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,cannot help thinking that the readiness with which this theory has been
12368,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,received is due to the prevalent enthusiasm for such hypotheses. When
12369,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,soberly considered the evidence in its favour is of the slightest.
12370,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
12371,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"In conclusion we must take account of another hypothesis, which seems"
12372,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to be particularly popular at present--namely that many characters have
12373,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"been attracted into the Trojan cycle from different quarters, some from"
12374,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"other cycles of heroic poetry, and some from local tradition. Strictly"
12375,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,speaking we have here to do with two different hypotheses; but they
12376,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,may conveniently be taken together. Both are credible enough under
12377,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,certain conditions. In the first place we must assume the existence of
12378,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,a nucleus of original matter sufficient to provide the 'attractive'
12379,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"force. Secondly, the poets' audience must not have such knowledge"
12380,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,either of the original or the subsidiary stories as would check their
12381,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,readiness to allow the amalgamation. Thus no audience of the fifth
12382,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,century would have consented to see Heracles introduced into a drama
12383,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,dealing with Orestes. But medieval German poems do bring Dietrich von
12384,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Bern into association both with Attila and Eormenric, although we know"
12385,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that the three heroes belonged originally to quite distinct stories.
12386,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,This parallel has frequently been urged in support of the contention
12387,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that Agamemnon or Nestor or Idomeneus may once have belonged to
12388,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,separate stories before they were associated with Achilles or Aias the
12389,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Locrian or whoever it was who was first connected with the siege of
12390,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Troy.
12391,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
12392,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,In Chapter XI we discussed the supposed analogy between Homeric and
12393,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,medieval German poetry and came to the conclusion that it had no
12394,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,foundation. The roots of the latter doubtless go back to court-poetry.
12395,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,But for centuries it was preserved only by popular minstrels; and
12396,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,during this period it underwent not only a process of disintegration
12397,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"in regard to subject-matter, but also a complete change both in"
12398,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,spirit and metrical form. Our discussion led us to conclude that
12399,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,there was no ground for supposing the Homeric poems to have passed
12400,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,through such a stage as this--that on the contrary they appear to
12401,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,have been preserved by court poets until they attained their final
12402,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,form. But heroic court-poetry is everywhere bound by convention. The
12403,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,poet must be a master of traditional lore as well as of form; but he
12404,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"must not be a revolutionary. He may borrow descriptions, incidents,"
12405,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"probably also minor characters, from other stories and even from"
12406,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,folk-tales--especially when he is dealing with the adventures of a
12407,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"solitary wanderer in unknown lands[462]. But, since his audience"
12408,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,likewise consists of persons who are more or less trained in the same
12409,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"kind of lore, he will find considerable difficulty in transferring a"
12410,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,well-known hero from one story to another--more difficulty indeed than
12411,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in inventing the hero outright. He would probably have just about as
12412,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,much chance of success as a modern dramatist who wished to introduce
12413,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Cromwell into a serious play dealing with Napoleon Bonaparte. We must
12414,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,have good evidence before we can believe that the court poets of
12415,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,ancient Greece were able to indulge in such flights of imagination.
12416,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
12417,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,But no such evidence appears to be forthcoming[463]. One of the cases
12418,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,most commonly cited is the fight of Tlepolemos and Sarpedon. This case
12419,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,rests partly on the fact that the two combatants are represented as
12420,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"coming from districts, both remote from Troy but not very distant from"
12421,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"one another, and partly on the groundless assumption that opponents"
12422,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,must be near neighbours. Unfortunately Sarpedon himself is killed by
12423,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Patroclos, a hero from Phthiotis. To meet this difficulty we find a"
12424,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"further hypothesis, which need not be discussed here. I do not say"
12425,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that it is impossible that Tlepolemos and Sarpedon have been taken
12426,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,from a different story. My view is that until it is supported by
12427,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,evidence[464] such a conjecture does not deserve serious consideration.
12428,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,The same remark applies to the case of Idomeneus which has likewise
12429,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,been cited in this connection. Indeed it is surely a fatal objection to
12430,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"this hypothesis as a whole that, with one exception[465], the heroes"
12431,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of the Iliad are persons who are known practically only in connection
12432,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,with the siege of Troy. The force of this objection may be appreciated
12433,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,by the fact that both poems contain many incidental allusions to heroes
12434,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"who are well known to us from other sources, as well as to persons of"
12435,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,whom we know little or nothing at all. If the personnel of the Iliad
12436,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,has really grown up through a process of attraction how is it that
12437,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Heracles, Iason, Peirithoos, Theseus, Minos and Adrastos have not been"
12438,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,drawn into the net? Some of them certainly have sons or grandsons who
12439,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"figure in the Iliad; but it deserves to be remarked that, with the"
12440,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"exception of Idomeneus, these are all persons of little importance."
12441,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,On the other hand the fathers of the principal heroes are themselves
12442,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in no case--unless we count Tydeus--'heroes of the first rank.' Can
12443,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,any one seriously argue that such a result as this would be produced
12444,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"by an artificial scheme--a scheme, that is to say, in the framing of"
12445,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,which poets had a free command of their material? On the contrary the
12446,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"only conclusion, I think, to which an unbiassed study of the evidence"
12447,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"can lead, is that the poets never enjoyed such freedom; that the later"
12448,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"poets were bound by the work of their predecessors, and these again by"
12449,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,something which bears a suspicious resemblance to facts of real life.
12450,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
12451,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,*       *       *       *       *
12452,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
12453,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,In the course of this and the preceding chapters we have reviewed
12454,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,briefly a number of hypotheses which have been brought forward from
12455,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,time to time with the object of explaining the origin of the characters
12456,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,and events treated in the Homeric poems. These hypotheses may be
12457,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"grouped summarily under four headings: (i) nature-myths, (ii) tribal"
12458,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"heroes, (iii) fiction, (iv) transference. In dealing with the first"
12459,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,group we have restricted ourselves to the consideration of two cases
12460,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,which appear as yet not to have fallen into the same discredit as the
12461,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,rest. Our conclusion however is that they rest on equally unsubstantial
12462,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"foundations. The second group is more popular just now, and this we"
12463,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,have examined at length. We find that--apart from some genealogical
12464,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"names--this group of hypotheses rests upon a number of assumptions,"
12465,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"some of which are incapable of proof, while others are demonstrably"
12466,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,incorrect. The third group has a much better case. We find that the
12467,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,use of fiction appears to be shown not only in the presentation of
12468,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the stories (as in Teutonic poetry) but also in the invention of
12469,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,minor characters. The extent to which it is used is a problem which
12470,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,requires further investigation. The last remark applies also to the
12471,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,fourth group. In principle it is only reasonable to expect that both
12472,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,characters and incidents may have been transferred from one story to
12473,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,another. But the instances which have been suggested are tainted with
12474,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the 'tribal hero' hypothesis and the evidence on which they rest is
12475,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"altogether inconclusive. Lastly, we have noted that, if our view of"
12476,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the history of Homeric poetry is correct, the use of both fiction"
12477,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,(invention) and 'transference' must have been confined within certain
12478,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,limits[466].
12479,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
12480,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,It may perhaps be said that these conclusions show an inadequate
12481,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,recognition of the results attained by modern investigations in the
12482,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,history of Greek heroic tradition. But we may fairly ask how many
12483,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"definite results have been attained in this field--results, I mean,"
12484,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"which command the unanimous approval, or anything like the unanimous"
12485,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"approval, of present-day scholars. It is a common opinion, at least in"
12486,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"this country, that the general effect has been rather to obscure than"
12487,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to solve the real problems presented by the poems. If we put aside the
12488,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,opinions of more conservative scholars we may indeed find a common
12489,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,element--namely the belief that the attitude of the ancients themselves
12490,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to stories of the Heroic Age was mistaken. But this belief cannot be
12491,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,regarded as a result established by the investigations; it is rather
12492,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,their starting point.
12493,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
12494,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,By 'the ancients' I do not mean merely the poets and mythographers of
12495,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"antiquity. It is admitted that ""the basis of fact in Homer is fully"
12496,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"as real to Thucydides as to Herodotus."" Now the work undertaken by"
12497,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Thucydides was not a history of the Trojan War; but he had evidently
12498,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,considered that story. Apparently it did not occur to him to doubt
12499,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"that the war had taken place, or even that the expedition had been"
12500,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"commanded by Agamemnon, king of Mycenae. What he had reflected on was"
12501,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the question whether the expedition was really on so large a scale as
12502,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,is stated in the Iliad; and the result to which his reflections brought
12503,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,him was that there was not a sufficient case for scepticism (οὔκουν
12504,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,ἀπιστεῖν εἰκός). We are at liberty to form a different opinion. Yet
12505,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Thucydides was a man no whit inferior intellectually to the best of
12506,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,modern scholars. Moreover he had the advantage of being a native; and
12507,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"he was separated from the Heroic Age by some six centuries, whereas we"
12508,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,are separated from it by nearly thirty. There can be little doubt that
12509,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"many sources of information were open to him--traditions, poems and"
12510,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,even monuments--which are entirely lost to us. It seems to me therefore
12511,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that before we disregard the opinions of such persons we shall do well
12512,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to consider carefully in what respects we are better qualified for
12513,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,forming a judgment.
12514,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
12515,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,So far as I can see we have the advantage in two respects only.
12516,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Firstly, there is the evidence of the Egyptian monuments and of that"
12517,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,prehistoric Aegean civilisation which has been revealed to us by the
12518,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"discoveries of Schliemann, Dörpfeld, Evans, Halbherr and many others."
12519,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,It is at least improbable that Thucydides was as well acquainted with
12520,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,either of these sources of information as we are. If he had seen
12521,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Dr Dörpfeld's excavations at Troy he might perhaps have modified
12522,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"his opinion about the numbers of the Achaean army, although he had"
12523,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,noted the dimensions of Mycenae. But that after all is a trifle. Can
12524,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,it be said that the general effect of the new evidence has been to
12525,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,discredit the tradition? The records of Rameses II and his successors
12526,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,have definitely disposed of the idea that Agamemnon's expedition was
12527,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"anything impossible, while the discoveries in Crete have shown once for"
12528,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,all that 'early' does not mean the same thing as 'primitive.' It is a
12529,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,significant fact therefore that in many investigations of the type we
12530,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,are discussing little or no use has been made of this new evidence.
12531,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,The evidence on which they rely is evidence which was at least as
12532,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,accessible to Thucydides as it is to us.
12533,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
12534,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Secondly, it is in our power, probably far more than it was in that of"
12535,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Thucydides and his contemporaries, to compare the Homeric stories with"
12536,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,others of the same type. It is here that our great advantage lies. But
12537,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,can it be said that this advantage has been turned to account by modern
12538,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,writers? Many works contain no reference to any poetry other than Greek
12539,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"and Latin--the latter of which, owing to its dependence upon Greek, is"
12540,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"of little value for our purpose. Many others, it is true, have used the"
12541,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,evidence of Teutonic heroic poetry. But only by taking a single poem
12542,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"belonging to the latest stratum, without reference to its history or"
12543,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"its connections in the poetry of other Teutonic peoples, and by using"
12544,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,precarious hypotheses as to the origin of the story as a foundation
12545,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,for similar hypotheses in relation to the Homeric stories. The earlier
12546,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,strata of Teutonic heroic poetry have been ignored as much as the
12547,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,heroic poetry of other European peoples.
12548,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
12549,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,I have no doubt that much which is obscure in Homeric poetry and
12550,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,tradition may be illuminated by a historical study of heroic poetry
12551,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"elsewhere--not merely Teutonic but also Celtic, Slavonic and even"
12552,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,non-European. For the story of the Iliad in particular I suspect that
12553,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,a fairly close parallel--perhaps the closest of all--is to be found
12554,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in those Servian poems which deal with the battle of Kossovo[467].
12555,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,My object however in this book is to bring to light the relations of
12556,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Greek and Teutonic heroic poetry--or rather to make a start in that
12557,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"direction, for the object is by no means one which can be accomplished"
12558,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in a single attempt. So much however may be said with confidence even
12559,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"now: all that we know, apart from hypotheses, with regard to the"
12560,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,origin of the Teutonic heroic stories corresponds to the views held by
12561,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Thucydides and his contemporaries.
12562,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
12563,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,With the affinities between Homeric poetry and the old Teutonic
12564,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,court-poetry we shall have to deal in the next chapter. I do not think
12565,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that any true analogy to the medieval German poems is to be found in
12566,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Greek literature; but I have ventured to suggest (p. 239 f.) that the
12567,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,poems of the Edda have something in common with those of Stesichoros
12568,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"and his followers. Apart from the poems however, Greek literature"
12569,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"preserves numerous records of the Heroic Age, frequently, though not"
12570,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"always, in the form of local traditions. Some of these are doubtless"
12571,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,due to the influence of Homeric or 'Stesichoric' poetry; but we have
12572,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,no right to assume that this is universally true. There are a number
12573,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"which appear to be of popular origin, whether they come from poems of"
12574,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Stage III (cf. p. 94 ff.) or from poems which were 'popular' from the
12575,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,beginning or from stories which never were clothed in poetic form.
12576,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
12577,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"As an example we will take the story of Minos. So far as I know, there"
12578,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,is no evidence that this hero figured prominently in any early poems
12579,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"of which we have record, though incidental allusions to him occur both"
12580,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,in the Iliad and the Odyssey. Yet there is no doubt that the Greeks
12581,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,regarded him as one of the very greatest figures of the far past. The
12582,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,most striking tradition recorded of him is that he possessed a powerful
12583,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"fleet, which enabled him to subdue the islands, to put down piracy and"
12584,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,thus to secure safety for navigation. This thalassocracy is mentioned
12585,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"both by Herodotus (I 171, III 122) and Thucydides (I 4, 8); and the"
12586,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,former adds that no such attempt to command the sea was made again
12587,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"until the time of Polycrates of Samos, in the latter part of the sixth"
12588,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,century. Later writers relate the famous story of the Minotaur; they
12589,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"represent Minos also as the founder of cities, including Cnossos and"
12590,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Phaistos, the great prehistoric palaces lately excavated, and as a"
12591,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,legislator or judge. In what is commonly regarded as one of the latest
12592,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,additions to the Odyssey (XI 568 ff.) we find him giving judgments
12593,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,among the dead.
12594,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
12595,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,It is obvious enough that the story of Minos contains many mythical
12596,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,features. But do these features constitute the original kernel of
12597,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"the story, or are they accretions, due to folk-tales or popular"
12598,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"belief? We need not enter here into the story of the Minotaur, upon"
12599,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,which Dr Evans' discoveries have thrown such a curious light. But
12600,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,there are other features in the story which may be illustrated from
12601,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,medieval beliefs regarding Dietrich von Bern. Sometimes we find
12602,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"this hero represented as the leader of the 'Wild Hunt,' the army of"
12603,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,ghosts[468]--a position elsewhere occupied by Wodan or other mythical
12604,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,beings. In medieval German homilies and other religious works he
12605,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,is credited with having been the founder of several famous Roman
12606,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"buildings, such as the Amphitheatre at Verona and the Castle of St"
12607,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Angelo at Rome[469]. In such beliefs we have a close enough parallel
12608,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to the traditions of Minos. There is no reason for supposing that
12609,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the Greeks were better acquainted with the prehistoric Cretans than
12610,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the Germans were with the ancient Romans. In both cases doubtless it
12611,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,seemed natural to attribute the foundation of venerable buildings
12612,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,to a prominent hero of their own race[470]. But Dietrich von Bern
12613,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"(Theodric, king of the Ostrogoths) was not originally a mythical being."
12614,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,
12615,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Nor need the tradition of Minos' thalassocracy be regarded as
12616,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,altogether incredible. We have seen that in the reigns of Merenptah
12617,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,and Rameses III Egypt and the neighbouring lands were invaded by large
12618,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,forces from the Aegean or even more remote regions. After the time
12619,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"of Rameses III we hear little of these peoples, though it is clear"
12620,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,that they had formed settlements on the coast of Palestine. From
12621,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,the following centuries we have apparently only one detailed piece
12622,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"of information relating to the Mediterranean, namely the story of a"
12623,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"certain Unuamen (or Wenamon), an official belonging to the temple of"
12624,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Amen at Thebes, who had been sent to the Lebanon to buy timber[471]."
12625,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,From this story we may infer with some probability that the eastern end
12626,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,of the Mediterranean was policed or controlled by the fleets of some
12627,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Aegean nation[472]. The time to which the story refers is either the
12628,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,reign of Herhor or that of his predecessor Rameses XII[473]--about the
12629,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,beginning of the eleventh century. That seems to be approximately the
12630,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,time indicated for Minos by Greek tradition; for according to Il. XIII
12631,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,451 f. and Od. XIX 178 ff. he was the grandfather of Idomeneus. It is
12632,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,scarcely impossible that an ambitious Greek prince of this age may have
12633,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,been animated by the desire of regaining the supremacy of the ancient
12634,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,"Cretans, just as Theodric was inspired by the idea of restoring under"
12635,FICTION IN THE HOMERIC POEMS.,Gothic rule the power formerly held by the Roman emperors.

12639,FOOTNOTES:,[451] It has been held that the Aeolic settlements in the Troad

12658,FOOTNOTES:,"in Chaonia, i.e. opposite the island of Corfu, which was usually"
12659,FOOTNOTES:,identified with Scheria in ancient times. It has been remarked by
12660,FOOTNOTES:,several scholars that the name Βαιάκη is obviously independent of
12661,FOOTNOTES:,Homeric poetry. We may infer also (i) that it was derived from a
12662,FOOTNOTES:,non-Greek source and (ii) that if Βαιακ- and Φαιηκ- are identical the
12663,FOOTNOTES:,latter name must have become known to the Greeks in very early times.
12664,FOOTNOTES:,It is not impossible that in the Heroic Age the Greeks may have been

12667,FOOTNOTES:,civilisation on the Albanian coast--such as we find depicted in Od.
12668,FOOTNOTES:,VI-VIII. Until such evidence is forthcoming probability is in favour
12669,FOOTNOTES:,of the view that the picture drawn of the Phaeacian community in the
12670,FOOTNOTES:,Odyssey is derived from a different region--most likely from the Aegean.
12671,FOOTNOTES:,
12672,FOOTNOTES:,[454] Possibly Θερσίτης is another example of this type. It seems to
12673,FOOTNOTES:,"me more probable however that it is a nickname, similar to Ἶρος (Od."

12676,FOOTNOTES:,"p. 53). But I cannot see any justification for the hypothesis (_ib._,"
12677,FOOTNOTES:,p. 57) that the practices described by Pausanias (III 14. 8 f.; XIX 7
12678,FOOTNOTES:,"f.; XX 2. 8) represent a contest between Enyalios and Achilles, or for"
12679,FOOTNOTES:,connecting them in any way with the story of the killing of Thersites

12689,FOOTNOTES:,
12690,FOOTNOTES:,[456] Under the head of fiction I think we may probably include many
12691,FOOTNOTES:,"national names and names derived from cities, rivers, etc. It has been"
12692,FOOTNOTES:,"remarked above (p. 268, note) that these names occur chiefly among the"

12695,FOOTNOTES:,"Ἰδαῖος, Σκαμάνδριος, Θηβαῖος, Θυμβραῖος. I do not mean of course to"
12696,FOOTNOTES:,suggest that all such names are necessarily fictitious. The type
12697,FOOTNOTES:,"doubtless was ancient, but it possessed obvious facilities for the"
12698,FOOTNOTES:,formation of names for fictitious characters of foreign nationality.
12699,FOOTNOTES:,
12700,FOOTNOTES:,[457] This point seems to me to be of fundamental importance; but it
12701,FOOTNOTES:,is apparently not always recognised. Prof. Meyer (_Geschichte des
12702,FOOTNOTES:,"Alterthums_, II p. 207) holds, rightly as I think, that there is no"
12703,FOOTNOTES:,valid reason for doubting that Troy actually was destroyed by a king of
12704,FOOTNOTES:,"Mycenae. Yet elsewhere (_ib._, p. 186 f., etc.) he regards Agamemnon"
12705,FOOTNOTES:,himself as a Spartan deity and most of the other chief Achaean heroes
12706,FOOTNOTES:,as mythical or fictitious or at least unconnected originally with the
12707,FOOTNOTES:,"story of Troy. According to my view the interest in heroic poetry,"
12708,FOOTNOTES:,"Greek as well as Teutonic, Welsh or Servian, was from the beginning"
12709,FOOTNOTES:,"essentially bound up with individual characters, e.g. not with a"
12710,FOOTNOTES:,(nameless) king of Mycenae--which is comparatively seldom mentioned
12711,FOOTNOTES:,(cf. p. 274)--but with King Agamemnon. It is true that under certain
12712,FOOTNOTES:,conditions one name occasionally does displace another in heroic
12713,FOOTNOTES:,stories; but we have seen no reason for believing that the conditions
12714,FOOTNOTES:,favourable to such changes ever prevailed in the history of Greek
12715,FOOTNOTES:,heroic poetry. Neither the name Ἀγαμέμνων nor the later inferences to
12716,FOOTNOTES:,Ζεύς Ἀγαμέμνων seem to me to afford any valid ground for doubting that
12717,FOOTNOTES:,Agamemnon was the king of Mycenae originally concerned in the story.
12718,FOOTNOTES:,
12719,FOOTNOTES:,[458] Note should be taken also of the fact that the peculiar type
12720,FOOTNOTES:,of nomenclature which we find among the Phaeacians (cf. p. 299) is
12721,FOOTNOTES:,not confined to the list of athletes but spread over the whole of
12722,FOOTNOTES:,this section of the poem. It is quite possible of course that the few
12723,FOOTNOTES:,"exceptional names, such as Ἀλκίνοος, may be derived from tradition or"

12764,FOOTNOTES:,depends largely upon the question whether the Doloneia formed an
12765,FOOTNOTES:,original part of the story of the Iliad. That is a view which would
12766,FOOTNOTES:,probably gain the assent of few scholars--even of those who believe
12767,FOOTNOTES:,that the Doloneia is not much later than the rest of the Iliad in its
12768,FOOTNOTES:,final form. The other arguments are of little consequence. Diomedes
12769,FOOTNOTES:,displays a propensity for capturing chariots--a feature which perhaps
12770,FOOTNOTES:,gave rise to the adventure with Rhesos; but the same remark is true of
12771,FOOTNOTES:,"Antilochos. He fights also with the 'Thracian' god Ares, as well as"
12772,FOOTNOTES:,with Aphrodite. But it is clear that the feud with these deities really
12773,FOOTNOTES:,"belongs to Athene, Diomedes' hereditary guardian. In later stories,"
12774,FOOTNOTES:,"relating to the east of Italy, there may have been a confusion between"
12775,FOOTNOTES:,the two heroes; and it is scarcely impossible that here and there
12776,FOOTNOTES:,Diomedes of Argos took over a cult belonging to his namesake. If so we
12777,FOOTNOTES:,shall have to suppose that the Bistonian Diomedes was originally an

12888,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,representing himself to be a deserter. Murad gave orders that he was to
12889,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,be allowed to come near and say what he wished. But when he reached the
12890,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"door of the Sultan's tent he threw his spear and slew Murad, meeting"
12891,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,with his own death immediately afterwards. Laonicos however also says
12892,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,that the Turks gave quite a different account of the affair--namely
12893,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"that as Murad was pursuing the enemy a Servian (ἄνδρα Τριβαλλόν), who"
12894,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"was on foot, turned and transfixed him with a javelin. Ducas' version"
12895,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,of the story (p. 15) resembles that given by the poems in the fact that
12896,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"the assassin uses a dagger. His name is not given, but he is said to"
12897,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,have been a young and distinguished Servian and to have asked to see
12898,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,Murad as a deserter with important information.
12899,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,
12900,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,Closer affinity with the poems is shown by the anonymous translation
12901,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"of Ducas' history (p. 352 ff.), which contains much additional"
12902,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,matter. Indeed it is scarcely possible to doubt that the additions
12903,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"are partly derived from poems, though these may not have been exactly"
12904,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"identical with any which are now extant. When Miloš ('Milos Cobilichio,"
12905,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"capetanio de Lazaro') reaches the Sultan's tent we are told, as in the"
12906,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"poems[477], that he is bidden to kiss Murad's foot 'according to the"
12907,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,usage of his kingdom[478].' Far more striking however is the account
12908,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"of the banquet on the preceding day, which in places appears to be"
12909,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,little more than a free translation of a fragmentary poem published in
12910,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"Karadžić's collection[479]: ""El zorno precedente a quello che seguì"
12911,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"la iniqua et infelice bataglia, Lazaro convocati tutti i signori et"

12924,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"Signoria."""
12925,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,
12926,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"This translation is believed to be of Dalmatian origin[484] and,"
12927,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"according to Prof. Bury[485], itself dates from the fifteenth"
12928,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,century. We are bound to conclude therefore that Miloš' exploit was
12929,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,treated in poems--from which some of the extant pieces are ultimately
12930,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,descended--within a century of the battle. The earliest direct
12931,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,reference to poems dealing with _Khobilouitz_ (i.e. Miloš Kobilović)
12932,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"goes back to the first half of the sixteenth century, at which time"
12933,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,they are said to have been numerous[486]. It may be however that the
12934,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,accounts given by Ducas himself and by Laonicos are also derived
12935,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,ultimately from poems[487]. But if so the poetic treatment of the
12936,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,subject must have begun within living memory of the battle; for it is
12937,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,clear from the evidence of these authors that by the middle of the
12938,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,fifteenth century the story had come to the Greeks in more than one
12939,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,form and that it had even attained great celebrity among them[488].
12940,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,
12941,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,The Kossovo poems certainly give us some evidence for the phenomenon
12942,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,which we have above (p. 307) called 'transference.' In one poem
12943,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"(Karadžić, II 46, v. 59 ff.) we find it stated that King Vukašin"
12944,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,entered into the battle and met with his death. In reality he was
12945,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,killed at (or shortly after) the battle of the Marica in 1371. The same
12946,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"poem also, immediately afterwards (v. 71 ff.), introduces Erceg Stepan,"
12947,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,who lived nearly a century later. But this poem[489] is of a very
12948,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,peculiar type--distinctly non-heroic--and it is not legitimate to draw
12949,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,conclusions from it as to the poems in general. It would be of far more
12950,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,importance for our purpose if we knew that Jug Bogdan was attracted
12951,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"into the story. He must certainly have been an old man in 1389, since"
12952,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"he had his territories granted to him by Dušan, who died in 1356. But"
12953,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,he is regularly described as 'the old' (_stari_) in the poems. The fact
12954,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,also that he had been a vassal of Murad from 1372 onwards is hardly
12955,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,conclusive; for it is clear that a great effort was made in 1389 to
12956,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"unite the various Servian princes. On the whole the evidence, so far"
12957,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"as it is known to me, does not seem to indicate that attraction or"
12958,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,transference has played an important part in the story.
12959,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,
12960,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"For the invention of characters there is, so far as I know, no"
12961,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,absolutely decisive evidence. But probably few would be inclined to
12962,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"regard such a person as Vaistina, the servant or squire (_sluga_) of"
12963,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"Musić Stefan[490] (Karadžić, II 47), otherwise than as a product of"
12964,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,fiction; and the same remark applies to the squire Milutin who brings
12965,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,the news of Lazar's death to the queen (_ib._ 45. 146 ff.). It is a
12966,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,more difficult matter to form an opinion as to whether any of the
12967,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,more important characters are fictitious. Several of them appear to
12968,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,be unknown from contemporary historical works. Among these we may
12969,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"mention Musić Stefan himself and more especially Banović Strahinja, the"
12970,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"hero of the longest poem in the cycle (_ib._ 44). So far as I know,"
12971,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"the earliest reference to the latter is in the Chronicle of Tronoša,"
12972,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"which mentions incidentally the destruction of his palace[491]. Again,"
12973,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,according to the poems Miloš was accompanied on his errand to Murad by
12974,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"two of his friends, Milan Toplica and Ivan Kosančić. Both these persons"
12975,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"are mentioned in the same connection by the Chronicle of Tronoša,"
12976,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"which adds that at the banquet on the preceding night they, as well as"
12977,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"Miloš, had been charged with disloyalty by the king. This chronicle is"
12978,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,believed to be derived from a MS. of the sixteenth century; but there
12979,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,is practically no doubt that it has drawn largely from poetic sources.
12980,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"Our earliest authorities, Laonicos and Ducas, together with the"
12981,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"translation of the latter, seem to imply distinctly that Miloš carried"
12982,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,out his exploit alone. That however does not prove that the characters
12983,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"themselves are fictitious. On the whole, considering the limited amount"
12984,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"of information which early records furnish, it would probably be wise"
12985,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,to hesitate before adopting the view that any of the more important
12986,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,characters are invented--at all events those which can be traced back
12987,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,to within two centuries of the battle.
12988,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,
12989,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,There seems to be no evidence for the introduction of what can properly
12990,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,be called mythical beings in poems of the Kossovo cycle[492]. But
12991,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"sometimes we certainly find supernatural incidents. In Karadžić, II"
12992,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,45. 119 ff. two crows from the field of Kossovo bring to the queen the
12993,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,first news of the battle and of Lazar's death. A more extravagant case
12994,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,occurs in the opening verses of (_ibid._) II 46--a poem to which we
12995,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,have already referred. Lazar is here made to receive a letter dropped
12996,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,by a swallow (which is carried by a falcon) offering him the choice
12997,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,between the heavenly and earthly kingdoms. In another (Croatian) poem
12998,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"(Karadžić, II 48[493]) the mother of the Jugovići prays that she may"
12999,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,receive the eyes of a falcon and the wings of a swan. Her prayer is
13000,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"answered, and she flies to the field of Kossovo and sees the dead"
13001,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,bodies of her sons and husband. This poem is largely taken up with the
13002,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,marvellous throughout and has little in common with heroic poetry.
13003,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,
13004,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,But it is from the point of view of their presentation of the story
13005,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,that the Kossovo poems chiefly merit our attention. This presentation
13006,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,contains many features which may be included under the head of fiction.
13007,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,Yet in certain cases it is a question whether we have not rather what
13008,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,may be called a growth of myth. By this I mean the introduction and
13009,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"development of motives which, though incorrect historically, can hardly"
13010,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"be regarded, at least in their entirety, as conscious inventions of an"
13011,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,individual. They would seem rather to have originated in rumour and
13012,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,popular misconceptions. As examples we may take what are perhaps the
13013,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,two most salient features in the story--the exploit of Miloš and his
13014,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,confederates and the treachery of Vuk Branković.
13015,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,
13016,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,We have already dealt with the first of these incidents. The poems
13017,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,make Miloš and his companions perform prodigies of valour before they
13018,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,are overcome. But our earliest authorities state that Miloš was killed
13019,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,almost immediately; and they imply that he was alone. Indeed we know
13020,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,that the Turks gave quite a different account of Murad's death. It is
13021,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,not at all clear that between the two the Servian account possesses the
13022,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,greater probability. But it may very well have been believed among the
13023,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"Servians from the very beginning, whether its origin is to be traced"
13024,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,to genuine information derived from the Turkish camp or merely to idle
13025,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,rumour.
13026,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,
13027,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"Again, the treachery of Vuk Branković is proclaimed again and again in"
13028,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,the poems. But there is no evidence earlier than the sixteenth century
13029,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,to substantiate the charge[494]. The first reference to treachery in
13030,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,Lazar's army occurs in the translation of Ducas' history (p. 354); but
13031,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"here the traitor is called 'Dragossavo Probiscio, capitaneo del campo"
13032,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,del dispoto.' It has been suggested that Vuk's unenviable celebrity in
13033,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"the poems is due to the unpopularity of his son, George Branković, who"
13034,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,ruled over Servia from 1427 to 1457[495].

13037,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,
13038,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,The above brief sketch will probably be sufficient to show that these
13039,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,poems are capable of throwing a good deal of light upon the origin
13040,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"and development of a heroic story. The period is one for which,"
13041,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"comparatively speaking, a fair amount of information is available; and"
13042,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,quite possibly more might be obtained by a careful investigation of
13043,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,the documents of that age. It is to be remembered of course that after
13044,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,the middle of the fifteenth century nothing like court poetry can have
13045,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,existed in Servia. We should expect then that from this time onwards
13046,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,the poems would become more and more permeated by those characteristics
13047,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,which we have assigned to Stage III of our scheme. As a matter of fact
13048,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,some of the poems show these characteristics only to a comparatively
13049,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,slight degree. This is especially the case with the poem on the
13050,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"banquet (Karadžić, II 50 iii); but part of this poem, as we have seen,"
13051,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,can be traced back to the fifteenth century. On the other hand the
13052,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,characteristics of Stage III are very strongly marked in Karadžić II 46
13053,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,and 48. I should expect that these poems are late compositions.
13054,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,
13055,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,So far as I have been able to deal with the subject the result of
13056,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,the discussion has been that there is little or no definite evidence
13057,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,for the invention of characters. That is a result which can scarcely
13058,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"be regarded as surprising, in view of the history of Servian poetry."
13059,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,On the other hand the conditions were such as we should expect to
13060,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,be exceptionally favourable to the development of transference or
13061,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,attraction. Yet there is but little satisfactory evidence in this
13062,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,direction. I am inclined therefore to think that the force of this
13063,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,principle has been considerably overestimated by recent writers. What
13064,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,the Kossovo poems do seem to suggest is--not that the characters of the
13065,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,"Iliad were invented or attracted from other quarters, but that their"
13066,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,exploits and their relations with one another may in reality have been
13067,NOTE VII. THE BATTLE OF KOSSOVO IN SERVIAN POETRY.,very different from what we find depicted in the poem.

13189,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13190,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13191,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Our review of the Homeric poems has led us to conclude that their
13192,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,origin and early history was in many respects analogous to that of the
13193,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"English heroic poems; and further, that there is no valid reason for"
13194,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"regarding the stories with which they deal as mythical or fictitious,"
13195,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"although we cannot, as in the case of the English poems, actually prove"
13196,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,that they rest upon a historical basis. We must now endeavour to see
13197,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,what common elements the two series of poems contain in regard to style
13198,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,and spirit. This will enable us to determine whether the term 'Heroic
13199,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"Age,' as applied to the two cases in common, can be held to mean"
13200,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"anything more than an age of 'heroes,' whose deeds were celebrated in"
13201,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,poetry.
13202,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13203,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,The most cursory glance at the two groups of poems will be sufficient
13204,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,to show that they contain many common features in regard to style. In
13205,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"both we find the constant repetition of the same formulae, e.g. in"
13206,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,the introduction of speeches. Thus in the first part of Beowulf eight
13207,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,speeches out of thirteen by the hero himself are introduced by the
13208,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"formula: _Beowulf maþelode bearn Ecgþeowes_, while three of Hrothgar's"
13209,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,seven speeches follow the words: _Hroðgar maþelode helm Scyldinga_.
13210,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,In the Iliad we may compare the constant repetition of such formulae
13211,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,as: τὸν δ' ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη κρείων Ἀγαμέμνων or: τὸν δ' ἠμείβετ'
13212,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,ἔπειτα Γερήνιος ἱππότα Νέστωρ. The explanation of such formulae is
13213,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,probably to be found in the fact that both sets of poems were designed
13214,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,for preservation by oral tradition. In literary poems such as the
13215,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Aeneid they seem to be avoided. Indeed the words introducing a speech
13216,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,are here seldom allowed to occupy a whole verse.
13217,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13218,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Another feature common to the two groups of poems is the love of
13219,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,describing somewhat minutely the details of a transaction which in
13220,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,itself is nothing unusual. Often in such cases they use very similar
13221,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,language. Thus in Od. IV 778 ff. Antinoos' preparations are described
13222,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"as follows: ""With these words he picked out twenty men who were the"
13223,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"best, and they went on their way to the swift ship and the sea-shore."
13224,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,First of all they pushed out the ship into deep water; and they placed
13225,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,the mast and the sails in the black ship and made ready the oars in
13226,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"the leathern rowlocks, each in its proper place, and spread out the"
13227,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,white sails. And high-hearted squires carried their arms. The ship
13228,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,they moored afloat in the roadstead; but they themselves disembarked.
13229,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"There they took their supper and waited for the approach of evening."""
13230,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"With this passage we may compare Beow. 205 ff.: ""The hero had with him"
13231,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"picked champions of the men of the Geatas, the bravest he could find;"
13232,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,so with fourteen companions he made his way to the vessel. A skilful
13233,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,pilot was the man who pointed out the features of the coast. When due
13234,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"time had elapsed the ship was afloat beneath the lee of the cliff, and"
13235,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"the warriors all prepared ascended the prow, where the waves of the sea"
13236,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,were playing upon the sand. Into the bosom of the craft men bore their
13237,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"bright treasures, even their resplendent armour. The company pushed off"
13238,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"their timbered craft and started on the adventure of their choice."""
13239,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13240,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Again the movements of royal personages in their palaces are sometimes
13241,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"rather carefully noted. In Od. I 328 ff. we are told that ""Icarios'"
13242,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"daughter, thoughtful Penelope, became conscious of the glorious song"
13243,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,in her upper chamber; and she descended the lofty staircase of her
13244,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"dwelling, but not alone, for two attendant maidens accompanied her. Now"
13245,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,when the noble lady drew near the suitors she stood beside the pillar
13246,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"of the well built house, holding her shining veil before her face; and"
13247,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"one of her trusty attendants stood by her on either side."" With this we"
13248,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"may compare Beow. 921 ff.: ""As for the king himself, the guardian of"
13249,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"the ring-hoards, famed for his sterling qualities--he likewise strode"
13250,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,majestically from his bedchamber with a great following; and with him
13251,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"his queen traversed the ascent to the mead-hall, accompanied by a band"
13252,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,of maidens. When Hrothgar arrived at the hall he stood by the pillar
13253,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"(?), gazing on the lofty roof, adorned with gold, and on Grendel's arm."""
13254,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13255,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Both poems also elaborate the various stages in the arrival and
13256,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,reception of visitors. As an example we may take the account of
13257,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"Telemachos' arrival at Menelaos' palace in Od. IV 20 ff.: ""At this"
13258,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,time the hero Telemachos and Nestor's distinguished son had drawn
13259,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,up with their horses in the vestibule of the palace. Now the lord
13260,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"Eteoneus, renowned Menelaos' active squire, came forward and saw them."
13261,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,And he went on his way through the building to give the news to the
13262,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,shepherd of the people; and standing beside him addressed him with
13263,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"winged words."" Menelaos replies that the strangers are to be brought"
13264,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,in at once. The arrival of Beowulf at the Danish king's palace is
13265,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"described at much greater length. First, he is greeted by Wulfgar, the"
13266,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"king's herald and henchman. Then he replies, and Wulfgar promises to"
13267,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"take his message. ""Quickly then he sped to where Hrothgar was sitting,"
13268,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"aged and grey-haired, among his retinue of nobles. Exulting in his"
13269,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,prowess he passed on until he took his stand at the side of the prince
13270,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"of the Danes; for he knew the usage of chivalry."" After this we have"
13271,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"still three more speeches--first by Wulfgar to the king, then the"
13272,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,latter's reply and finally Wulfgar's answer to Beowulf--before the
13273,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,visitors enter.
13274,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13275,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,We may compare also the formulae used in greetings to strangers. Thus
13276,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,in Od. I 169 ff. Telemachos addresses the disguised Athene as follows:
13277,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"""Now come, tell me this and declare it plainly: Who of men art thou,"
13278,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,and whence? Where are thy city and thy parents? And (tell me) upon
13279,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"what sort of a ship thou hast come""--with several other questions."
13280,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"Another case occurs in III 71 ff., where Nestor is greeting Telemachos:"
13281,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"""Sirs, who are ye, and whence do ye sail the watery paths? Is it upon"
13282,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"some enterprise, or do ye wander over the sea at random, like pirates"
13283,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"who rove, risking their lives and bringing evil to men of other"
13284,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"lands?"" Beowulf receives a somewhat similar greeting from the Danish"
13285,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"coast-guard, when he lands (v. 237 ff.): ""What warriors are ye that"
13286,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"thus have come clad in coats of mail, bringing hither your lofty ship"
13287,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"over the waters along the high road of the sea?"" And again, shortly"
13288,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"afterwards (v. 251 ff): ""Now must I know your origin, before ye start"
13289,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,hence and proceed further as spies into the land of the Danes. Ye
13290,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"dwellers afar, ye who traverse the sea, hear now my fixed resolve. Best"
13291,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"is it with speed to make known whence ye are come."""
13292,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13293,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"Again, both poems like to dwell upon the emotions felt in greeting or"
13294,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,bidding farewell to friends. Thus in Od. XVI 14 ff. it is stated that
13295,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"Eumaios ""came up to his lord and kissed his head and both his fair eyes"
13296,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"and both his hands, and the hot tears fell from him. As an affectionate"
13297,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,father greets his son when he returns from a distant land after nine
13298,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"years absence--an only son and well loved (?), for whose sake he has"
13299,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,endured many hardships--even so then did the noble swineherd kiss
13300,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"godlike Telemachos all over and embrace him as one escaped from death."""
13301,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,With this we may compare the account of Hrothgar's farewell to Beowulf
13302,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"(v. 1870 ff.): ""Then did the king of noble lineage, the prince of the"
13303,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"Scyldingas, kiss that best of squires and clasp him round the neck."
13304,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"Tears fell from him, as he stood there with his grey hair. Aged and"
13305,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"venerable as he was, he felt uncertain, indeed he thought it unlikely,"
13306,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,that they would ever meet again in spirited converse. So dear was this
13307,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,man to him that he could not restrain his heart's emotion; but in his
13308,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"breast, fast bound within his heart, a secret longing for the beloved"
13309,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"man burnt in his blood."""
13310,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13311,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"The frequent use of similes, as in the last passage from the Odyssey,"
13312,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,is one of the chief features in which Greek heroic poetry differs from
13313,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Teutonic. Sometimes however the same kind of picture is brought before
13314,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,us in a different way. Thus among the commonest Homeric similes are
13315,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,those derived from hunting scenes. A typical example occurs in Il. XV
13316,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"271 ff.: ""As when hounds and men of the country chase a horned stag or"
13317,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"a wild goat, and it is saved by a precipitous rock or dense wood, and"
13318,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"they cannot succeed in finding it,"" etc. With this may be compared a"
13319,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,passage in Beowulf describing the pool in which the demons had made
13320,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"their lair (v. 1369 ff.): ""Though the heath-ranger, the stag of mighty"
13321,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"horns, may make his way to the forest when beset by hounds after a long"
13322,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"chase, he will yield up his spirit and his life on the brink before he"
13323,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"will be willing to shelter his head therein."""
13324,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13325,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"Occasionally we meet with similes of a more ambitious, not to say"
13326,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"extravagant, character, as in Il. II 455 ff., where the gleam arising"
13327,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,from the bronze armour of the Achaean army is compared to the blaze
13328,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,produced by a forest fire. For this also we find parallels in Teutonic
13329,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"poetry, e.g. Finn 35 f.: ""A gleam arose from the swords, as though"
13330,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"Finn's fortress were all on fire."""
13331,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13332,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,In the use of epithets and poetical expressions many remarkable
13333,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,parallels are to be found. Some of these are merely of a descriptive
13334,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"character, e.g. ἄκριας ἠνεμοέσσας (Od. XVI 365) beside _windige"
13335,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"naessas_ (Beow. 1359), and some are little more than circumlocutions,"
13336,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"e.g. υἷες Ἀχαιῶν, _Geata bearn_, for Ἀχαιοί, _Geatas_. In other cases"
13337,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"however a distinct metaphor is involved, as when ships are called ἁλὸς"
13338,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"ἵπποι (Od. IV 708), corresponding to the Anglo-Saxon _brimhengest_,"
13339,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"which is probably an epic word, though it does not occur in the extant"
13340,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,fragments. In particular note should be taken of the metaphorical terms
13341,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"applied to kings, e.g. ποιμὴν λαῶν which may be compared with _folces"
13342,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"hyrde_, ἕρκος Ἀχαιῶν with _eodur Scyldinga_, and perhaps also οὖρος"
13343,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Ἀχαιῶν with the very common expression _eorla hleo_.

13347,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,The characteristics which we have been discussing up till now affect
13348,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,only the language and style of the two groups of poems. But it is to be
13349,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,observed that they possess also certain common features which appear
13350,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,to be of deeper significance. Thus such expressions as ὄλβον ἐπέκλωσαν
13351,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,or _wigspeda gewiofu_ ('the webs of success in war') are probably to
13352,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"be traced to a primitive religious conception, which may be seen more"
13353,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"clearly in Od. VII 196 ff.: ""There he shall experience afterwards"
13354,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,whatever Fate and the stern Κλῶθες ('spinning women') spun for him

13365,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,cf. XXIV 37 f.) and undoubtedly had a religious significance. This may
13366,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"be seen especially from the speech of Elpenor in Od. XI 71 ff.: ""There"

13374,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"It will be observed that this passage, apart from its religious"

13376,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,may not be forgotten. Here we are brought to one of the most striking
13377,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"characteristics of heroic poetry, both Greek and Teutonic, namely"
13378,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"the constantly expressed thirst for fame, both during one's own life"
13379,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,and in after times. As a typical example we may take a passage from
13380,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"Hector's speech before his combat with Aias (Il. VII 85 ff.): ""I will"

13400,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13401,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,The summit of a hero's ambition is to have his glory celebrated
13402,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,everywhere and for all time. Odysseus himself says (Od. IX 20) that his
13403,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,glory reaches to heaven. His wife bewails her troubles in the following

13426,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,The last passage introduces us to another prominent characteristic of

13429,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"Sometimes this is represented as taking place in the banqueting hall,"
13430,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"as in Il. XX 83 ff., where the disguised Apollo thus taunts Aineias:"
13431,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"""Aineias, thou counseller of the Trojans, where now is thy boasting,"
13432,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"in which thou didst vow to the princes of the Trojans, when quaffing"

13434,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"Achilles son of Peleus!"" We may compare Beow. 480 ff.: ""Often enough"
13435,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"have scions of combat vowed over the ale-cup, when drunken with beer,"
13436,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,that they would abide Grendel's onset in the hall with their terrible
13437,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"swords."" Beowulf himself indulges in a similar boast (v. 636 ff.): ""I"

13440,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13441,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"Again, it is by boasting of much the same kind that warriors make"
13442,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,themselves known to one another when they meet in battle. A typical
13443,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"example occurs in Finn 24 ff.: ""Sigeferth is my name. I am a prince of"
13444,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,the Secgan and a rover known far and wide. Many hardships and stern
13445,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,encounters have I endured. Here too thou shalt have for certain (i.e.
13446,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,I shall not draw back from) whichever course (i.e. war or peace) thou

13454,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"Trojans."""
13455,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13456,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,It will be seen that in this passage Idomeneus prides himself as much
13457,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,on his ancestry[497] as on his own prowess. The idea of inherited
13458,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"valour finds expression again in Il. V 252 ff., where Diomedes says"
13459,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"to Sthenelos: ""Exhort me not to flight, for I am sure thou wilt not"
13460,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"persuade me. Nowise inbred in me is it to fight a runaway battle,"
13461,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"neither to cower in fear. My courage is steadfast still."" Practically"
13462,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"the same idea appears in Beow. 2694 ff.: ""Then, as I have been told,"
13463,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,in the national king's dire need the knight stood upright and showed
13464,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"forth his prowess--strength and valour such as was inbred in him."""
13465,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13466,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,The feeling of pride in a noble family becomes clearly noticeable also
13467,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,on occasions when the family is threatened with extinction. Beowulf's
13468,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"farewell words to Wiglaf are (v. 2814 ff.): ""Thou art the last remnant"

13471,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"We may compare Od. XIV 180 f., though here the speaker, Eumaios, is"
13472,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"only a dependent of the house: ""On his return home the illustrious"
13473,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"suitors are lying in wait for him, in order that the seed of godlike"

13475,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13476,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"Lastly, the heroic spirit shows itself in the exhortations of"
13477,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,princes to their followers. As an instance we may quote a verse
13478,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"which occurs several times, in speeches of Hector and Patroclos:"
13479,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"""Be men, my friends, and set your minds upon impetuous valour."" The"
13480,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"same exhortation, though in a more elaborate form, occurs in Finn 10"
13481,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"ff.: ""But awake now, my warriors, have your hands ready (or 'take"
13482,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"your mail-coats'), be mindful of your prowess, leap forth in the"
13483,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"forefront (?), be stout of heart."""
13484,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13485,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,It is true that these last two passages would in themselves be
13486,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,appropriate in any martial poetry. But we must take the context into
13487,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"account. Patroclos immediately (XVI 271 f.) adds the words ""in order"
13488,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"that we may do honour to the son of Peleus, who is by far the best"
13489,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"of the men of Argos."" So in Finn 40 f. we are told that ""never was a"
13490,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,nobler recompense paid for sweet mead than was (then) rendered to Hnaef
13491,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"by his bachelors."" The same thought occurs elsewhere in the English"
13492,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"poems, e.g. in Beow. 2634 ff., where Wiglaf is exhorting his comrades:"
13493,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"""I remember the time when we were receiving mead, when in the beer-hall"
13494,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"we pledged ourselves to our lord who gave us these bracelets, that"
13495,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"if need like this befell him we would repay the battle-harness, the"
13496,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"helmets and sharp swords."" And again, shortly afterwards (v. 2646 ff.):"
13497,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"""Now is the day come that our liege-lord needs the strength of brave"
13498,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"warriors. Let us draw near to help our war-chief, so long as the heat"
13499,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"of the fierce and terrible flames shall last."""
13500,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13501,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,The underlying idea is clearly that which is described by Tacitus
13502,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,(_Germ._ 14) in his account of the comitatus of the ancient Germans:
13503,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"""The _principes_ fight for victory, but the _comites_ fight for their"
13504,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"_princeps_[498]."" And this description is probably true of the Homeric"
13505,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Greeks just as much as of the Teutonic heroes. The terms used in the
13506,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"two sets of poems (θεράπων--_þegn_, i.e. _comes_; ἄναξ--_dryhten_, i.e."
13507,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"_princeps_), seem to correspond to one another almost exactly, though"
13508,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,it is not easy to find a satisfactory rendering for them in modern
13509,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"English. For kings too, especially such as are of preeminent position,"
13510,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,we find in each case a very similar expression (ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν--_eorla
13511,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"dryhten_), which properly denotes the relationship of liege-lord."
13512,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13513,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,In both cases alike the leading idea of the Heroic Age may be fittingly
13514,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,summed up in the phrase κλέα ἀνδρῶν. This is practically equivalent
13515,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"to the Anglo-Saxon _dom_, with which we have dealt above (p. 87 f.)."
13516,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,It is essential to notice that the object so much prized is personal
13517,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,glory. In Hector's speech before his combat with Aias (cf. p. 325) the
13518,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,glory which would result from the combat to the hero or his opponent is
13519,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,the only subject touched upon. No consideration is taken of any effect
13520,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,which might be produced thereby upon the fortunes of the war.
13521,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13522,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,The same characteristic appears throughout the passages which we have
13523,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,quoted and countless others. Occasionally we hear also of pride of
13524,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"family, but scarcely ever of any truly national feeling. Patroclos"
13525,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,exhorts his men to bravery (Il. XVI 270 ff.) in order that they may
13526,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,win glory not for the Achaean nation but for their own personal lord;
13527,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,and he adds further that by so doing they will bring shame upon the
13528,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,national leader. Achilles himself retires from the conflict owing to a
13529,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"personal wrong, and only returns to it in order to avenge his friend."
13530,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,The same phenomena appear in the English poems. That Wiglaf whose
13531,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,bravery is said to be 'inbred' (cf. p. 328) was the son of a certain
13532,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"Weohstan, whose great achievement was the slaying of the Swedish prince"
13533,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Eanmund. Yet Eanmund was at this time apparently under the protection
13534,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"of Heardred, king of the Geatas, who also lost his life in the same"
13535,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"war. Weohstan however, though he belonged to the Geatas, was in the"
13536,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"service of Onela, their enemy. It would seem then that he was fighting"
13537,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,against his own nation. Such cases appear to have been by no means
13538,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,uncommon in the Teutonic Heroic Age. For it was customary at that time
13539,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,for young noblemen to take service under foreign princes; and the
13540,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,obligations which personal service imposed were held to be superior to
13541,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,all others.
13542,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13543,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Love of home and zeal in its defence are of course frequently mentioned
13544,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,in both groups of poems. We may refer to the common phrase φίλην ἐς
13545,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"πατρίδα γαῖαν. Most frequently however, as we might expect, these"
13546,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"features appear in connection with the Trojans. In Il. XII 243, when"
13547,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"Pulydamas has urged retreat in consequence of an omen, Hector replies:"
13548,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"""The best of all omens is to fight in defence of our country."" Priam"
13549,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"uses the same expression (_ib._, XXIV 499 f.) when he comes to plead"
13550,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"with Achilles for his son's body: ""He preserved my city and its"
13551,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"inhabitants, even Hector whom thou hast now slain as he fought in"
13552,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"defence of his country."" These feelings may be regarded as forms of"
13553,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"patriotism; but it is patriotism of a distinctly practical kind, as may"
13554,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"be seen from Il. XV 494 ff., where Hector is addressing his followers:"
13555,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"""Now fight in close formation at the ships. Whosoever of you through"
13556,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"shot or blow meets with death and fate, let him die. Not unseemly is it"
13557,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,for him to die fighting in defence of this country. He will leave his
13558,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"wife and children in safety, his house also and his estate unharmed,"
13559,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"if the Achaeans depart with their ships to their own dear fatherland."""
13560,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Much the same feelings are expressed in the English poems. As an
13561,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"example we may take Beow. 520 ff., where Unferth is describing the"
13562,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"return of Breca after his swimming contest: ""Welcome to his subjects"
13563,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"was he when he made his way to his own dear home, the land of the"
13564,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"Brondingas and his beautiful sacred city[499] where people, city and"
13565,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"treasures belonged to him."" We may refer also to Widsith, v. 119 ff.:"
13566,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"""I have visited Wulfhere and Wyrmhere. Often enough did they wage war"

13573,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13574,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Such passages as these afford abundant evidence for patriotism of the
13575,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,practical kind. But this is not the same thing as national pride. We
13576,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,shall best be able to appreciate the special characteristics of heroic
13577,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"poetry in this respect by comparing it with other martial poems, dating"
13578,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,from later times. An excellent example of national pride is furnished
13579,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,by the well-known epitaph on Leonidas and the Spartans who perished
13580,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,at Thermopylai. We may also quote the 'Laconian Embaterion' commonly
13581,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"included among the fragments of Tyrtaios: ""O ye youths, whose fathers"
13582,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"have been citizens of Sparta, the home of heroes, come, hold forth the"
13583,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,shield in your left hand and cast the spear with good courage. Regard
13584,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"not your life, for so to do is not Sparta's ancestral custom."" Other"
13585,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,good examples may be found in the works of the early elegiac poets.
13586,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13587,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,What perhaps deserves notice above all in poetry of this type is the
13588,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,use of the first person plural with reference to exploits performed
13589,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,by the poet's nation in bygone times--a form of speech which seems
13590,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,to be quite foreign to heroic poetry. An example occurs in Tyrtaios'
13591,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"Eunomia (fragm. 2): ""This city has been given to the Heracleidai by"
13592,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"Zeus himself, the son of Cronos and husband of fair-crowned Hera."
13593,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Together with them we forsook breezy Erineos and made our way to
13594,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"Pelops' broad island."" Here the reference is to the first arrival of"
13595,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,the Dorians in the Peloponnesos. Another case may be found in the poem
13596,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"on the Messenian war (fragm. 5): ""... our king Theopompos dear to the"
13597,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"gods, by whose help we captured spacious Messene.... Round about it"
13598,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"(or 'for its sake') war was waged for nineteen years, ever without"
13599,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"ceasing, by the fathers of our fathers, warriors who possessed the"
13600,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"spirit of endurance."" A similar usage appears in Mimnermos, fragm. 9:"
13601,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"""On quitting steep Pylos, the town of Neleus, we came in ships to the"
13602,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"pleasant land of Asia, and at fair Colophon with overmastering strength"
13603,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"we took up our abode, beginning the arduous assault. Thence in turn,"
13604,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"starting from the river Aleis, by the will of the gods we took Aeolian"
13605,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"Smyrna[501]."" Both the foundation of Colophon and the capture of Smyrna"
13606,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,took place long before the poet's time.
13607,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13608,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,The same patriotic sentiment is to be found in the martial poetry of
13609,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,later times in England. Thus in the poem on the battle of Brunanburh
13610,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"(v. 20 ff.) we are told that ""throughout the whole day the West Saxons"
13611,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,with troops of horse pressed on in pursuit of the enemy's forces.
13612,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Fiercely they cut down the fugitives from behind with swords sharpened
13613,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,on the grindstone. Nor did the Mercians refuse stern hand-to-hand
13614,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,combat to any of the warriors who in the ship's bosom had followed
13615,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"Anlaf over the rolling waters to our land, to meet their doom in"
13616,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,battle. On the field of action lay five young kings stretched lifeless
13617,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"by the sword; and with them seven of Anlaf's earls, and a countless"
13618,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"host both of the seamen and the Scots."" And again (v. 65 ff.):"
13619,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"""Never in this island before now, so far as the books of our ancient"
13620,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"historians can tell us, has greater slaughter been made of an army by"
13621,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,the edge of the sword--since the time when the Angles and Saxons made
13622,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"their way hither from the east over the wide seas, invading Britain,"
13623,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"when warriors eager for glory, proud forgers of war, overcame the Welsh"
13624,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"and won for themselves a country."""
13625,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13626,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,We need not hesitate to interpret the last part of this quotation as
13627,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"an expression of national consciousness, just as much as in the poem"
13628,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"of Mimnermos given above, although it does not use the first person"
13629,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,with reference to the achievements of the Saxon invaders. But the poem
13630,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,as a whole differs essentially from the heroic type owing to the fact
13631,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,that--though the princes are mentioned incidentally--it is permeated
13632,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,throughout by the sense of national rather than individual glory.
13633,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13634,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Thus far we have been dealing with individual passages in the poems.
13635,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Now we must consider briefly the motives of the stories and the
13636,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,characteristics for which the heroes are celebrated. The story of
13637,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Beowulf consists of a series of adventures in which the hero seeks to
13638,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"display his prowess in encounters with monsters. The story of Finn, if"
13639,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"we may form an opinion from the fragmentary evidence at our disposal,"
13640,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"dealt with a fatal quarrel between two brothers-in-law, followed by"
13641,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"revenge. The theme of Waldhere's story is the elopement, or rather"
13642,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"escape, of lovers and the bravery shown by the hero in defence of his"
13643,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,bride. The term elopement may more properly be applied to the story
13644,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"of Heðinn and Högni, whatever was the original form of its ending. A"
13645,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"counterpart to this is furnished by the story of Hagbarðr and Signý,"
13646,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,which ended tragically in the death of the lovers. The story of Sigurðr
13647,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"deals with a woman's revenge, brought about by disappointed love. The"
13648,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,theme of the story of Hamðir and Sörli is the revenge undertaken by
13649,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,them for the death of their sister. Revenge is likewise the theme of
13650,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Ingeld's story--in this case for the death of a father. The story of
13651,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Offa is an instance of heroism in single combat. In the various stories
13652,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,connected with Dietrich von Bern attention is centred chiefly on the
13653,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"bravery, loyalty and resourcefulness of the hero and his knights."
13654,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13655,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,It will be seen that throughout the heroic poetry of the Teutonic
13656,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"peoples, in episodes as well as in the main stories, the chief motif"
13657,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,is almost invariably love or revenge or personal bravery. The same
13658,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,remark applies obviously enough to Greek heroic poetry--to the Iliad
13659,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"and Odyssey, as well as to the stories of Heracles, Iason and the"
13660,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,rest. The characteristics too for which the heroes are distinguished
13661,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"are on the whole very much the same in both cases--strength, courage,"
13662,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"resourcefulness, generosity, hospitality. The characters of Beowulf and"
13663,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"Hrothgar may appeal to us more than those of Achilles and Nestor, but"
13664,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,the main outlines are very similar. If there is any difference worth
13665,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,noting in this respect between the two sets of poems it is that the
13666,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Greek attach more importance to personal beauty--a feature which only
13667,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,becomes prominent in the later forms of the Teutonic stories.
13668,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13669,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Now let us turn for a moment to the heroes of 'post-heroic' times.
13670,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,During the centuries which immediately followed the Heroic Age we
13671,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,hear of many princes and other persons who rose to fame both in
13672,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,England and on the Continent. Sometimes this fame was acquired through
13673,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,successful warfare; but it is as generals rather than as warriors
13674,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,that such persons are celebrated. More frequently they are known to
13675,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"us as legislators, founders of institutions, promoters of religion"
13676,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,and protectors of the public peace. In this country we may think of
13677,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"such persons as the Kentish king Aethelberht, the Northumbrian kings"
13678,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"Edwin and Oswald, the Mercian king Offa, and, above all, of Alfred"
13679,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,the Great--not to mention numerous prominent ecclesiastics. In Greece
13680,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,the number of names known to us during the corresponding period is
13681,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,extremely small. Yet the most prominent names which we meet with at
13682,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,the dawn of the historical period are those of legislators and public
13683,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"benefactors, such as Zaleucos and Solon. In earlier times by far the"
13684,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"best known name is that of the Spartan legislator Lycurgos, whether he"
13685,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,was really a historical person or a character of mythical origin. We
13686,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"may perhaps compare him with that Wiger Spa, 'a heathen in the heathen"
13687,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"age,' whose authority is referred to in King Byrger's preamble to the"
13688,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Law of the Uppland Swedes.
13689,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13690,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,A similar character is borne by the traditional heroes of nations which
13691,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,have no Heroic Age. We may instance Bruteno and Widowuto the legendary
13692,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,founders and legislators of the state of the ancient Prussians. The
13693,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"same is true of the early kings of Rome, Romulus, Numa, Servius"
13694,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Tullius and the founders of the Republic. The essential feature which
13695,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,distinguishes these characters from those of the Heroic Age is the fact
13696,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"that they are known chiefly, not for what they performed or experienced"
13697,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"during their lives, but for the effects of their doings upon later"
13698,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,generations.
13699,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13700,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,The explanation of this difference is no doubt to be sought largely
13701,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,in the nature of the records. For a modern analogy to the stories of
13702,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Sigurðr or Achilles we should turn naturally to a romance or novel;
13703,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,for those of Offa or Lycurgos analogy would be sought rather in the
13704,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,biography of a statesman[502]. But it must be clearly recognised that
13705,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,the difference here does not lie between historical and unhistorical.
13706,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"Attila was a man of flesh and blood, no less certainly than Offa,"
13707,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,while the historical existence of Lycurgos is as much debated as
13708,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,that of Achilles. And what shall we say with regard to such a
13709,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,character as Romulus? The difference lies rather between political
13710,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"and non-political, or--to speak more accurately--between national"
13711,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,and non-national. Offa's fame is inseparably bound up with the
13712,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,aggrandisement and reorganisation of the Mercian kingdom. Lycurgos and
13713,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Romulus are scarcely conceivable without Sparta or Rome. But Sigurðr
13714,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,and Achilles might belong to any Teutonic or Greek community; in the
13715,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,former case indeed the hero's nationality is not known for certain.
13716,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,We have seen that the heroic poetry of the Teutonic peoples had what
13717,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,may be called an international circulation from the beginning; and we
13718,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,have no reason for doubting that in the Heroic Age itself the same was
13719,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,the case in Greece. On the other hand the memory of the later heroes
13720,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"and their achievements was preserved only, or almost only, in the"
13721,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,records and traditions of individual states. The interest to which
13722,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,stories of this latter group appeal is in general limited to the hero's
13723,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,own state; we have no evidence that such stories were international
13724,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,property[503]. It is the fact that the interest of the heroic stories
13725,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,was both individual and universal--i.e. that it lay in individuals not
13726,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,essentially bound up with a given community--which fitted them for
13727,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,international circulation.
13728,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13729,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,But this difference of interest is itself a matter which calls for
13730,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,explanation. If we are to trust the evidence of the records it is
13731,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,due to differences in the ideas which animated heroic and non-heroic
13732,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,society[504]. Among these we may note especially an essential
13733,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,difference in the conception of the state. With this question we shall
13734,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,have to deal more fully in a later chapter. It may be indicated here
13735,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,however that in the Heroic Age the state appears to have been regarded
13736,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,as little more than the property of an individual--or rather perhaps
13737,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"of a family, which itself was intimately connected with a number of"
13738,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,other families in similar positions. The decline and disappearance
13739,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,of kingship in Greece during the eighth century presupposes of course
13740,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,that such a conception had long ceased to retain its vitality. And even
13741,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"among the Teutonic peoples, which usually preserved the institution of"
13742,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"kingship, we find abundant evidence for a similar change of view. Among"
13743,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,the Franks kingship had long been a mere shadow when the non-royal
13744,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Pippin took the throne in 752. In England we do not meet with non-royal
13745,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,kings until more than a century later; but even by Bede's time it is
13746,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,clear that the kingdom had come to be looked upon as something more
13747,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,than the property of the royal family.
13748,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13749,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,*       *       *       *       *
13750,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13751,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,When once the characteristics of the spirit of the Heroic Age have
13752,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,been fully recognised they will be found to explain several features
13753,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,in the stories which have often been regarded as incredible. One of
13754,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,these is the fact that wars are generally represented as arising out
13755,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"of the personal quarrels or jealousies of princes, or out of wrongs"
13756,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,perpetrated by one prince upon another. Thus it has been assumed by
13757,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,many scholars that the story of the abduction of Helen is of mythical
13758,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"origin, not on account of any intrinsic improbability contained in"
13759,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"it, but because it is founded on a motif which is extremely common in"
13760,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,folk-tales. But it has been pointed out above (p. 265) that the reason
13761,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,why the abduction motif is common in folk-tales lies in the fact that
13762,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,under unsettled social conditions such occurrences were common in real
13763,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"life. The conditions of the Heroic Age, whether Greek or Teutonic, were"
13764,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,doubtless not normally so unsettled that the abduction of a queen or
13765,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,princess could fail to attract attention. In the case of the wife of a
13766,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,distinguished king it can scarcely be doubted that such an event would
13767,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"produce a profound sensation; and it is to this, we may presume, that"
13768,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,the story in the first place owed its celebrity. But the part played
13769,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,by women in international quarrels during the Teutonic Heroic Age must
13770,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,not be overlooked. In addition to the stories of which love adventures
13771,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,form the main theme (cf. p. 333) we may allude to such cases as Beow.
13772,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"2930 ff., where Haethcyn is said to have carried off the Swedish queen"
13773,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,with consequences disastrous to himself. Above all however it is well
13774,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,to bear in mind the story of the war between the Angli and the Warni
13775,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"(cf. p. 97 f.), a war which owed its origin to Radiger's repudiation"
13776,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,of his marriage contract with the English king's sister. We have seen
13777,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"that this story comes not from a poem, but from the work of a strictly"
13778,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,contemporary Roman historian.
13779,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13780,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Nor can it be said that this case stands alone. According to Gregory
13781,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,of Tours (III 6) the overthrow of the Burgundian kingdom was due to
13782,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"the instigation of Hrothhild, who implored her sons to exact vengeance"
13783,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,for the murder of her parents--a case not unlike the Norse version
13784,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,of the story of Hamðir and Sörli. Hildeberht's invasion of Spain was
13785,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"undertaken in answer to messages from his sister Hlothhild, who had"
13786,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"been illtreated by her husband, the Visigothic king Amalaric (_ib._,"
13787,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,III 10). The dissensions which eventually brought about the downfall
13788,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,of the Thuringian kingdom had their origin in the proud and jealous
13789,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"character of Amalaberga, the wife of Irminfrith (_ib._, III 4). Unless"
13790,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,we are prepared to shut our eyes to the plain evidence of history
13791,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,we are bound to recognise that the personal feelings of queens and
13792,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,princesses were among the very strongest of the factors by which the
13793,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,politics of the Heroic Age were governed.
13794,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13795,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,There has undoubtedly been a tendency among modern historians
13796,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,to neglect the personal element in early Teutonic history and
13797,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,to concentrate attention upon the movements of peoples and upon
13798,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,'constitutional' changes. The feature with which we have just been
13799,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,dealing is only one of several which owing to this neglect have been
13800,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"regarded as essentially 'poetic' motives, the origin of which must"
13801,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,be sought in myth or fiction. Decisive evidence to the contrary is
13802,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,furnished by writers of the sixth century. Certainly the picture of
13803,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Teutonic court life which they give produces a different impression
13804,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,from that which we gain from the poems. The atmosphere suggested
13805,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"by the latter is one of adventure and romance, whereas the former"
13806,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,convey an idea of reckless brutality. Yet it is only necessary to
13807,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,place the two sets of records side by side in order to see that the
13808,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,one is complementary to the other--that the difference lies not in
13809,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,the subjects treated but in the point of view from which they are
13810,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,regarded. Gregory (II 28) records without comment or explanation that
13811,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,the Burgundian king Gundobad slew his brother Hilperic (Hrothhild's
13812,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,father) with the sword and drowned his wife with a stone tied to her
13813,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,neck. If this incident had been treated in heroic poetry we should
13814,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,doubtless gain a very different impression. Different too would be
13815,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"the impression conveyed by the story of Sigurðr, if we had it from a"
13816,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Roman historian. But when the two stories are compared it cannot be
13817,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,said that the picture which the poems present of the Burgundian kingdom
13818,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,under Guthhere is incompatible with the picture which history gives
13819,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"us of the Burgundian kingdom under Gundobad, some fifty years later."
13820,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,No true impression of the Heroic Age can be obtained by crediting the
13821,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,youthful kings of unlearned communities with a knowledge of political
13822,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,principles which we have acquired from long study of the history of
13823,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,many nations; and it is equally futile to seek for grounds of policy in
13824,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,actions which very frequently were dictated solely by passion. Ambition
13825,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"was no doubt a factor, as in all stages of society. But the form which"
13826,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,it seems to have taken as a rule was purely personal and directed
13827,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,towards the acquisition of wealth or glory rather than with any view of
13828,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,establishing the kingdom upon a permanent basis[505].
13829,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13830,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Another feature to which exception has been taken is the fact that
13831,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,in battle scenes the fighting is generally represented as a series
13832,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,of single combats between the various leading men. Here again the
13833,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,objection seems to be based on a misunderstanding of the conditions
13834,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,of heroic warfare. In the first place we have no reason for doubting
13835,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,that in both the periods with which we are dealing the leaders were
13836,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,far better armed than the rank and file of the forces. In hand to hand
13837,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"fighting the possession of defensive armour, helmet and mail-coat,"
13838,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"constitutes an overwhelming advantage. Secondly, the passion for"
13839,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"personal glory, which is so prominent in the poems, must have prompted"
13840,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,the ambitious man to pick out the most distinguished opponents. If
13841,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,he was a 'squire' success would bring rich rewards[506]. But even
13842,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"the leaders themselves, as among the Germans of Tacitus' time[507],"
13843,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,were doubtless expected to distinguish themselves by preeminence in
13844,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"bravery, rather than by skilful generalship. Thirdly, and this is the"
13845,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"most important point, the general object aimed at in a battle was not"
13846,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,to gain a strategic advantage but to kill the leaders. Very often this
13847,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,meant the destruction of the enemy's organisation. At times indeed it
13848,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,appears that the death or capture of a king led forthwith to the end of
13849,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"hostilities. Thus in the battle of Strassburg in 357, when the Romans"
13850,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"captured the Alamannic king Chonodomarius, his personal retinue, to"
13851,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"the number of two hundred, gave themselves up voluntarily to share"
13852,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,his captivity[508]. And in Beowulf we see from more than one passage
13853,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,that when the king was slain the heart of the resistance was broken.
13854,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Under such conditions we may well believe that the direction to 'fight
13855,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"neither with small nor great, save only with the king,' was a piece of"
13856,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,perfectly sound policy.
13857,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13858,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"We have to take account moreover of another element, somewhat strange"
13859,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"to modern ideas, namely the intense eagerness to get possession of a"
13860,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,fallen enemy's arms. In the battle scenes of the Iliad this feature is
13861,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,constantly to the fore; indeed the most severe conflicts usually take
13862,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,place over the bodies of warriors. In the English poems it is much
13863,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"the same. We may quote Beow. 2985 ff.: ""Thereupon the warrior (Eofor)"
13864,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,despoiled his opponent. He took from Ongentheo his iron mail-coat and
13865,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"his sharp and hilted sword, together with his helmet, and brought the"
13866,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"old man's accoutrements to Hygelac."" And again v. 2613 ff.: ""To him"
13867,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,(Eanmund) Weohstan brought death in combat by the sword's edge; and
13868,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"to his kinsmen he presented the burnished helmet, the ring-formed"
13869,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,mail-coat and the ancient sword of giant workmanship--though the latter
13870,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"was returned to him by Onela."" It will be seen that the Teutonic"
13871,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"warriors, who in both these cases are 'squires,' render up the spoils"
13872,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"to their lords, whereas the Greek princes keep them for themselves; but"
13873,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,we need not doubt that they expected an equivalent reward.
13874,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13875,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,The article chiefly coveted seems to have been the coat of mail. In
13876,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"Wald. II 16 ff. the hero says to Guthhere: ""Take from me the grey"
13877,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"mail-coat, if thou dare; for thou seest how I am worn out with battle."
13878,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Upon my shoulders here stands an heirloom from Aelfhere; good it is
13879,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"and ..., adorned with gold, a superb garment for a prince to possess,"
13880,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"when his hand is defending life's treasure from his foes."" Such"
13881,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"articles were doubtless very costly, and often, as in this case, they"
13882,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,were handed on from generation to generation. Beowulf's coat of mail
13883,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"had belonged to his grandfather, and was believed to be the workmanship"
13884,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,of Weland. Before his encounter with Grendel he charges the king of the
13885,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Danes to send it back to Hygelac in the event of his death. A coat of
13886,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,mail which was found intact at Vi in Fyn contains about twenty thousand
13887,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"rings, and it has been calculated that such an article would take a"
13888,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,single workman nearly a whole year to make[509].
13889,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13890,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"It is to be remembered further that wealthy princes, prompted no doubt"
13891,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"by love of display, were in the habit of carrying about their persons"
13892,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,a considerable amount of gold. Glaucos indeed is said to have gone to
13893,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"battle in golden armour worth a hundred oxen (Il. VI 235 f.). Hygelac,"
13894,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"when he was slain, was wearing the magnificent necklet which Wealhtheo"
13895,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,had given to Beowulf (v. 1195 ff.). Historical records give evidence to
13896,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,the same effect[510]; and there can be little doubt that the spoils of
13897,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"such kings often amounted to a considerable fortune. If, in addition"
13898,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"to spoils of this kind, account is taken of the chances of booty and"
13899,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"ransoms, not only after a general victory but also in incidental and"
13900,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"more or less private forays[511], it will be seen that warfare of"
13901,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"the heroic type offered very substantial inducements, apart from the"
13902,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,acquisition of glory.
13903,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13904,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,It is not to be supposed that such warfare was really of an effective
13905,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,character. Even in the Iliad itself (VI 67 ff.) a warning is raised
13906,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"against it by the old Nestor, who is represented (_ib._ II 555) as an"
13907,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"exceptionally skilful general, but his advice seems to be unheeded."
13908,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"Between two armies of the heroic type the issue had to be decided, if"
13909,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"at all, by a pitched battle. Sheltered behind fortifications, even"
13910,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,an inferior army had not much to fear. In that case the people most
13911,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,exposed to danger were what we should call non-combatants--not only
13912,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,the women and children and unwarlike dependents of the combatants
13913,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"themselves[512], but also any neighbouring communities who might be"
13914,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,caught unawares by bands of hungry warriors.
13915,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,
13916,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"On the other hand against organised forces, like those of the later"
13917,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"Spartans or the Romans, at all events if commanded by generals who"
13918,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"followed a definite plan of campaign, the Homeric Achaeans would have"
13919,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,had no chance after the first encounter. This may be seen especially
13920,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"from the history of the campaigns against the Italian Gauls, who appear"
13921,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,to have employed a very similar method of warfare. The Saxons and
13922,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,other northern peoples owed their successes largely to the rapidity
13923,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"of their movements, combined with the fact that they had command of"
13924,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"the sea. But, so far as we know, they seldom or never had to deal with"
13925,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,any considerable Roman army. In Britain their procedure was probably
13926,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,similar to that followed by the Scandinavian invaders in the Viking
13927,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Age; but the latter were unable to cope with prolonged and organised
13928,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"resistance, such as was offered by Alfred the Great. The armies of the"
13929,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,Goths at the height of their power were doubtless more formidable; but
13930,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"they had probably learnt much from long experience of the Romans, both"
13931,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,as foes and allies. It is not to be forgotten however that supremacy
13932,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,"came ultimately to the Franks, who of all the Teutonic peoples seem to"
13933,THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF TEUTONIC AND GREEK HEROIC POETRY.,have been least affected by the spirit of the Heroic Age.

13970,FOOTNOTES:,[502] This analogy applies perhaps also to the objects aimed at in
13971,FOOTNOTES:,the two sets of records. Within certain limitations it may be said
13972,FOOTNOTES:,that the object of the heroic stories is to entertain and that of
13973,FOOTNOTES:,unheroic records to instruct. The latter remark holds good not only for
13974,FOOTNOTES:,historical works but also for tribal traditions and tribal law. It is
13975,FOOTNOTES:,likely that opportunity was taken to impart instruction of this type at

13985,FOOTNOTES:,which the reader may be referred to Dr Schütte's interesting book
13986,FOOTNOTES:,"_Oldsagn om Godtjod_ (especially pp. 118-197). But in heroic poetry,"
13987,FOOTNOTES:,"whether Teutonic or Greek, references to the early traditions of a"

13990,FOOTNOTES:,parallels we must turn to works of the Hesiodic school and the elegiac

13992,FOOTNOTES:,
13993,FOOTNOTES:,With regard to historical works we have to remember that all records
13994,FOOTNOTES:,dating from the Heroic Age are of foreign origin. But it is certainly
13995,FOOTNOTES:,to be noted that the interest of the stories given by Gregory of Tours
13996,FOOTNOTES:,and other writers of the sixth century--in so far as they relate to
13997,FOOTNOTES:,"persons of Teutonic blood--is essentially personal, and similar to that"
13998,FOOTNOTES:,which characterises the poems. This is the more noteworthy since these
13999,FOOTNOTES:,stories are related from a totally different point of view (cf. p. 338
14000,FOOTNOTES:,f.).
14001,FOOTNOTES:,
14002,FOOTNOTES:,[503] Except in so far as (in the case of Teutonic stories) they are
14003,FOOTNOTES:,connected with the Church.
14004,FOOTNOTES:,
14005,FOOTNOTES:,[504] I would call attention here to an interesting paper by Prof.
14006,FOOTNOTES:,"Heusler (_S.-B. d. Akad. d. Wiss. zu Berlin_, 1909, p. 920 ff.),"
14007,FOOTNOTES:,in which he seeks to show that the historical element in Teutonic
14008,FOOTNOTES:,heroic poetry has been exaggerated. The evidence adduced in favour
14009,FOOTNOTES:,"of this view consists in the first place of unhistorical situations,"
14010,FOOTNOTES:,"chronological dislocations, etc. Most of the examples are taken from"
14011,FOOTNOTES:,the later forms of the stories (Stage IV of our scheme). We have
14012,FOOTNOTES:,"already discussed these phenomena (p. 152 ff.), and here I would only"
14013,FOOTNOTES:,"add that the observation quoted from Prof. Murko's paper on p. 936,"
14014,FOOTNOTES:,"note, may be applied, _mutatis mutandis_, to chronological as well"
14015,FOOTNOTES:,as geographical relations. What interests us here however is the
14016,FOOTNOTES:,second piece of evidence brought forward by Prof. Heusler (p. 924
14017,FOOTNOTES:,"f.). He fully recognises and admirably expresses the individualistic,"
14018,FOOTNOTES:,non-national spirit of Teutonic heroic poetry--as contrasted with that
14019,FOOTNOTES:,"of the Old French epics: ""Es herrschen in unsrer Sage die persönlichen"
14020,FOOTNOTES:,"Ideen"".... ""Die germanische Sage kennt keinen Nationalfeind,"" etc."
14021,FOOTNOTES:,Yet apparently he regards this phenomenon ('die persönliche Fabel')
14022,FOOTNOTES:,"as a characteristic of the poetry only, and not of the society which"
14023,FOOTNOTES:,produced it. Now in order to prove that this is an 'unhistorical'
14024,FOOTNOTES:,element evidence must be brought to show that the attitude of the
14025,FOOTNOTES:,poems--the early poems (Stage II)--does not faithfully reflect the
14026,FOOTNOTES:,spirit of the age. I know of no evidence to justify so startling a
14027,FOOTNOTES:,conclusion; on the contrary we shall see in the following chapters that
14028,FOOTNOTES:,contemporary historical works frequently testify to the prevalence
14029,FOOTNOTES:,of the same ideas which we find expressed in the poems. Even the
14030,FOOTNOTES:,statement that Teutonic heroic poetry is 'unpolitical' seems to me to
14031,FOOTNOTES:,require some reservation. Certainly it knows nothing of modern ideas of
14032,FOOTNOTES:,politics. But have we any ground for disputing that it represents the
14033,FOOTNOTES:,"politics current in the courts in which it grew up? Lastly, objection"
14034,FOOTNOTES:,must be taken to the contrast drawn on p. 933 between Teutonic and
14035,FOOTNOTES:,Greek heroic poetry. So far as the Homeric evidence is concerned the
14036,FOOTNOTES:,observations made here apply not to the poems as we have them but to
14037,FOOTNOTES:,"certain hypotheses regarding their 'pre-history,' with which we have"
14038,FOOTNOTES:,dealt above (p. 267 ff.).
14039,FOOTNOTES:,
14040,FOOTNOTES:,[505] As a typical case we may cite the story of the Frankish prince
14041,FOOTNOTES:,"Hlothric (Greg. Tur., II 40), who at Clovis' suggestion caused his own"
14042,FOOTNOTES:,"father to be murdered. He offered Clovis a share of the treasures, but"

14044,FOOTNOTES:,over his father's treasure-chest.
14045,FOOTNOTES:,
14046,FOOTNOTES:,"[506] In Beow. 2991 ff. we are told that Eofor, who slew the Swedish"

14052,FOOTNOTES:,to be doubted that princes of the Heroic Age did seek to display
14053,FOOTNOTES:,their prowess in single combats. The story of Theodric's combat with
14054,FOOTNOTES:,"an Avar champion named Xerxer (Fredegar, _Chron._ II 57) appears"
14055,FOOTNOTES:,to be based on an exploit for which we have contemporary evidence
14056,FOOTNOTES:,"in Ennodius' Panegyric (p. 266 in Hartel's edition; cf. Jiriczek,"
14057,FOOTNOTES:,"_Deutsche Heldensagen_, I p. 140 f.), where the defeated warrior is"
14058,FOOTNOTES:,called _Bulgarum ductor_. It is well known also that the princes of the

14095,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14096,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14097,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The evidence of the German poems for the social and political
14098,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,conditions of the Heroic Age cannot be regarded as trustworthy owing to
14099,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the lateness of the period in which they were composed. In principle
14100,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the same is true also of the Norse poems. These reflect the conditions
14101,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of the Viking Age rather than those of the Heroic Age, though, as"
14102,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"we have already noted, the difference here is less marked. On the"
14103,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"other hand, in addition to the Anglo-Saxon poems and the works of"
14104,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"contemporary Roman historians, such as Ammianus Marcellinus, Jordanes"
14105,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"and Procopius, we have valuable evidence from the early Teutonic codes"
14106,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of law. Some of these, such as the Lex Salica and the Lex Burgundionum,"
14107,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"date from the first half of the sixth century or earlier, i.e. from"
14108,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the Heroic Age itself, while a number of others--in particular we may"
14109,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,note the earliest English laws--belong to the following two centuries
14110,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,and show probably little deviation from the custom of the Heroic Age.
14111,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,All the codes of course contain certain Roman or Christian elements;
14112,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,but this influence in some cases goes back to the fifth century or even
14113,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,further.
14114,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14115,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The chief forces which governed the social system of that age were
14116,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the bonds of kinship and allegiance. The influence of the former
14117,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"extended not merely, as with us, to rights of succession and duties"
14118,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of guardianship over children and women. It was also the power by
14119,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,which the security of the property and person of each member of the
14120,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"community was guaranteed. If a man received injury or insult, his"
14121,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,kindred were bound to assist him to obtain redress. If he were slain
14122,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,they had to exact vengeance or compensation from the slayer. On the
14123,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,other hand not only the slayer himself but every member of his kindred
14124,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"became liable to vengeance, and each had to pay his quota towards the"
14125,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"compensation (wergeld), just as it was divided among the kindred of the"
14126,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,slain--the proportion varying in both cases according to the degree of
14127,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,relationship. In case of bloodshed a certain sum had also to be paid
14128,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"to the king, even in the earliest times of which we have record; but"
14129,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"this sum seldom exceeded half the wergeld, and as a rule amounted to"
14130,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,considerably less.
14131,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14132,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The character and size of the kindred appear to have varied in
14133,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,different nations. Some laws speak of claims to succession as remote
14134,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"as the seventh degree, while the rights and duties connected with the"
14135,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,payment and receipt of wergelds seem generally to have extended as far
14136,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"as third cousins, i.e. the descendants of great-great-grandparents."
14137,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Again, we hear sometimes of royal or noble families which bore a"
14138,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"common name derived from some ancestor, real or mythical, from whom"
14139,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,their power or prerogatives were believed to be inherited. Such were
14140,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the Oescingas, the Wuffingas and the Icelingas, the royal families"
14141,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of Kent, East Anglia and Mercia respectively; so also the Scyldungas"
14142,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"(Skiöldungar) among the Danes, the Merovingi among the Franks,"
14143,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,and the Agilolfinga and other noble families among the Bavarians.
14144,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Persons belonging to these families had probably--in some cases
14145,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,certainly--special wergelds; and the throne or principality seems to
14146,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,have been regarded as in some sense family property. Some writers
14147,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,believe that kindreds in general were permanent organisations of this
14148,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"kind, and that originally they held land, and possibly other property"
14149,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"also, in common. But this view goes a good deal beyond what the facts"
14150,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"warrant, at all events for the period with which we are dealing."
14151,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,It is clear that at this time kinship on both sides was recognised
14152,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,everywhere; maternal relatives shared in the payment and receipt of
14153,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"wergelds with those on the father's side, though not always in the"
14154,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,same proportion. Moreover the idea that the inclusion of the maternal
14155,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"relatives was due to an innovation cannot be maintained. Thus, in"
14156,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,spite of the fact that the Frankish kings claimed the throne by direct
14157,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"descent in the male line from Merovechus, there are clear indications"
14158,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that Frankish law in its earliest form gave priority to the mother's
14159,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,side. No doubt on the whole the agnatic system of relationship had
14160,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,become predominant almost everywhere in the Heroic Age; but sufficient
14161,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,traces of the opposite system remain to render it probable that a
14162,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,change had taken place not so very far back[513].
14163,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14164,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Any such change of course involves--or rather perhaps implies--a
14165,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,weakening in the force of the bonds of kinship; and of this we have
14166,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,very clear evidence in the Heroic Age. Now it has often been pointed
14167,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,out that early Teutonic custom seems to have made no provision for the
14168,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,case of homicide within the kindred. In such a case the persons on whom
14169,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"vengeance devolved would be identical, in part at least, with those"
14170,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,against whom it would be directed--and so also with the compensation.
14171,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,It is generally held that homicide of this kind was extremely rare and
14172,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"that, when it did occur, the slayer was outlawed. That would no doubt"
14173,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,be in accordance with primitive custom. Indeed in a state of society
14174,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,based on blood-relationship the life of a kinsman must be sacred above
14175,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"all else. Further, it is clear enough that the shedding of kindred"
14176,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,blood was regarded with abhorrence in the Heroic Age. Thus Procopius
14177,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"(_Goth._ II 14), describing the euthanasia practised by the Heruli,"
14178,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"states that when the dying man has been laid upon the top of the pyre,"
14179,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,one of his countrymen goes up with a dagger and stabs him; but he adds
14180,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"explicitly that this man must not be related to his victim[514]. Again,"
14181,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"to take another point of view, perhaps the saddest passage in Beowulf"
14182,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,is that which relates how Herebald was accidentally killed by his
14183,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,brother Haethcyn. But the aspect of the case which first strikes the
14184,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"poet is not one which would appeal to a man of modern times. ""That was"
14185,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"a slaughter without compensation,"" he says (v. 2441 ff.), ""the prince"
14186,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"had to lose his life unavenged."""
14187,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14188,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Yet, in spite of all this, instances of the slaying of kinsmen seem"
14189,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to have been by no means uncommon in the Heroic Age. In Beowulf the
14190,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"spokesman of the Danish kings, Unferth, is said to have killed his"
14191,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"brothers, and though the fact was a reproach to him, it apparently did"
14192,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,not prevent him from holding an important office at court. In the same
14193,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"poem we hear of dissensions within the Swedish royal family, which"
14194,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,ended in death for both Onela and Eanmund. According to the legends
14195,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,preserved in Ynglingatal this family had had a very bad record for such
14196,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"quarrels in the past. Among the Goths we have the case of Eormenric,"
14197,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,who put his nephews Embrica and Fritla to death. And it is by no means
14198,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,only in poetry or tradition that we meet with such cases; historians
14199,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,also furnish numerous examples. Thus according to Gregory of Tours (II
14200,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"28) the Burgundian king Hilperic was killed by his brother Gundobad,"
14201,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"while Sigismund, son of the latter, had his own son, Sigiric, put"
14202,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to death (III 5). The Thuringian king Irminfrith slew his brother
14203,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Berhthari (III 4); the Frankish king Sigiberht was murdered by the
14204,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,orders of his son Hlothric (II 40). Clovis is said to have put to death
14205,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"a number of his relatives, while his sons and grandsons were repeatedly"
14206,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,involved in deadly strife[515].
14207,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14208,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,In view of such evidence we must conclude that the primitive sanctity
14209,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of the family was giving way in the Heroic Age. For the change of
14210,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,feeling which was taking place one passage in Beowulf is particularly
14211,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,instructive. In the struggle between Onela and Eanmund the latter was
14212,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,slain by one of the king's knights named Weohstan. He stripped the dead
14213,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,man of his arms and brought them to Onela who presented them to him and
14214,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"""said nothing about that deed of guilt although it was his brother's"
14215,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"son whom he (Weohstan) had laid low[516]."" To the modern reader the"
14216,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,poet's reflection seems strange; for Onela had been relieved of a
14217,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"dangerous foe, who was trying to deprive him of the kingdom. Yet there"
14218,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,can be no doubt that according to primitive tribal custom he ought to
14219,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,have taken vengeance upon his knight.
14220,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14221,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,It is clear then that primitive custom was breaking down even in
14222,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,countries far removed from contact with Christianity and Roman
14223,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"civilisation. We cannot tell indeed how far the change was general,"
14224,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,since our knowledge is practically limited to the princely families.
14225,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,It is by no means unlikely that the lower strata of society were more
14226,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,conservative in many respects.
14227,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14228,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"The principle which had now become dominant, at least in the higher"
14229,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"ranks, was that of personal allegiance. This principle was of course"
14230,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,by no means new. Even in Tacitus' works we hear of the _comites_ who
14231,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,lived and fought in their lord's service and thought it a disgrace to
14232,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,survive his death. In the Heroic Age however it is probable that among
14233,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the more northern peoples every man, except the king himself, had a"
14234,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,lord. In the Anglo-Saxon laws the lord shares with the kindred the
14235,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"duty of protecting his men, and when one of them is slain he receives"
14236,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,a special payment (the _manbot_) when the wergeld was paid to the
14237,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"relatives. Also, when any of his men die, at all events a man of the"
14238,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"higher classes, he is entitled to the heriot, i.e. the arms of the dead"
14239,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"man, which in theory at least the latter had originally received from"
14240,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,him[517].
14241,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14242,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"But in the poems, as is natural, we hear most frequently of the knights"
14243,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,who formed the courts and retinues of kings and princes. As a summary
14244,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of the services rendered by such persons to their lord, Tacitus' brief"
14245,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,description (_Germ._ 13) still holds good: their presence gave him
14246,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,dignity in time of peace and protection in war. They dwelt and served
14247,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"him at his court and joined him in hunting and other amusements,"
14248,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,while he rewarded their services with gifts of treasure and arms. In
14249,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the descriptions of kings which we meet with in the poems there is
14250,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,no characteristic--not even personal bravery--which receives more
14251,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,commendation than that of generosity to their followers. In return
14252,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the knight was expected to give up to his lord whatever he gained by
14253,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,his own exploits--just as Beowulf renders up to Hygelac and his queen
14254,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the valuable gifts which he had received from the king of the Danes.
14255,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,As an instance of personal devotion in time of war we may cite the
14256,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,surrender of Chonodomarius' retinue at the battle of Strassburg--an
14257,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,incident to which we have already referred (p. 340). So also in the
14258,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,various accounts of the fall of Hrólfr Kraki given by Scandinavian
14259,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,authorities the king's knights are said to have perished to a man. The
14260,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"same spirit survived in England in later times, as we see from the"
14261,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"story of Cynewulf's death, when in each of the two encounters only one"
14262,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,member of the defeated party was left alive. It was also thoroughly in
14263,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the spirit of the Heroic Age that Edwin's knight, Lilla, acted when he"
14264,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,threw himself between the king and the assassin and received a mortal
14265,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,wound in so doing.
14266,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14267,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,It was customary for the sons of noblemen to enter the king's service
14268,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,at an early age. Beowulf went to Hrethel's court when he was only
14269,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"seven years old; but this case may have been exceptional, as he was"
14270,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the king's grandson. When they reached manhood[518] the king was
14271,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"expected to provide them with estates or jurisdiction over land, which"
14272,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,would enable them to marry and support a household of their own. Thus
14273,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Beowulf, after proving his prowess at the Danish court, is presented"
14274,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,by Hygelac on his return with seven thousand hides--a considerable
14275,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,province--together with a residence and a prince's authority. The
14276,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"grant is accompanied by the gift of a sword, signifying that the bond"
14277,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of personal allegiance was still preserved. Beowulf in turn presents
14278,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,his young relative Wiglaf with the dwelling-place of their family and
14279,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the public rights appertaining thereto. The court minstrels Widsith
14280,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,and Deor receive grants of land from their lords. In two of these
14281,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,cases (those of Wiglaf and Widsith) we are told that the estate had
14282,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,previously been in the possession of the recipient's father; and we may
14283,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,probably assume that such cases were not uncommon. Yet it is plain that
14284,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,such practices must very largely have destroyed the tribal custom of
14285,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,succession--at least in the higher ranks of society.
14286,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14287,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Those who had received grants of land or jurisdiction did not
14288,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,thereupon cease to attend the court. In the English courts of the
14289,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"seventh century Bede distinguishes between the _comites_, who already"
14290,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"held office, and the _ministri_ or _milites_, who seem in general"
14291,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to have been young knights without such official positions. The
14292,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Anglo-Saxon version of the Ecclesiastical History translates _comes_
14293,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,by _gesið_ and _minister_ or _miles_ by _þegn_. In poetry both these
14294,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"words are of frequent occurrence, though they appear to be used more or"
14295,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,less indiscriminately. It should be observed that the word _þegn_ means
14296,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,properly no more than 'servant[519]' though (like _knight_ in later
14297,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"times) it came to be specialised, while _gesið_ is almost an exact"
14298,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,equivalent of _comes_[520]. In Beowulf however we meet with the same
14299,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"classes under the collective terms _geogoð_ and _duguð_, i.e. youths"
14300,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,and men of tried valour respectively. To the latter may be assigned
14301,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"such persons as Aeschere, Hrothgar's ""confidant and counsellor,"" who"
14302,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,had stood by his side on the battlefield; but the former class were
14303,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,probably as a rule in the majority.
14304,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14305,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Another characteristic of these retinues, which deserves notice, is the"
14306,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,fact that they were not always composed of born subjects of the king.
14307,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Bede (_H. E._ III 14) says that Oswine, the popular king of Deira,"
14308,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,attracted young noblemen to his service from all sides; and in the
14309,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Heroic Age such cases appear to have been frequent. Perhaps the most
14310,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"striking case in the poems is that of Weohstan, who took service under"
14311,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the Swedish king Onela and consequently became involved in hostilities
14312,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,against his own nation. It is probably due to the same custom that we
14313,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,find so many Teutonic chieftains serving under the Romans during the
14314,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Heroic Age. Among them we may mention Arbogastes, Stilicho, Ricimer"
14315,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,and Odoacer. Most frequently perhaps the men who sought service abroad
14316,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,were those who had either lost their lords or had had to leave their
14317,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,homes through vendetta. Such cases occur frequently in the Anglo-Saxon
14318,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,poems; we may refer especially to the Wanderer and the Husband's
14319,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Message. Further, it appears from the story of Waldhere and Hagena"
14320,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that even hostages were expected to fight for the prince to whom they
14321,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,had been given. In later times we may compare the case of the British
14322,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,hostage who was wounded in the fight following Cynewulf's murder. But
14323,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,there are a number of other stories which seem to indicate that it was
14324,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,at one time a regular custom for young princes to set out from their
14325,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"homes, on reaching manhood, and to seek the court of some foreign king"
14326,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,with a view to marrying his daughter and thereby acquiring a share in
14327,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the sovereignty. Such incidents are of the commonest occurrence in
14328,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"folk-tales; and we find them also in works, such as Hervarar Saga and"
14329,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Ynglinga Saga, which claim to be based on genuine tradition. It is in"
14330,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,this light too that all northern authorities represent the position of
14331,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Sigurðr at the home of Guðrún.
14332,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14333,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,What has been said above applies primarily of course to the more
14334,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,northern peoples. The Goths were early exposed to Christian and Roman
14335,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"influence, and the same is true also of the Burgundians, especially"
14336,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,after their settlement in Gaul. The Franks were no doubt less affected
14337,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,at first; but their customs seem from the beginning to have differed
14338,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,a good deal from those which we have been considering. They too had
14339,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,retinues of warriors (_antrustiones_ or _homines in truste regis_)
14340,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,attached to the kings by personal service; but the prevalence of
14341,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,lordship in the lower ranks of society is by no means so clear. The
14342,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,possession of land also seems to have been governed at first by tribal
14343,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,principles and later by that of succession in the male line--without
14344,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,reference to the will of a superior. These differences are doubtless
14345,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,connected with certain features which distinguished the social
14346,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,organisation of the Franks from that of the other Teutonic peoples.
14347,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14348,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Every one of the early Teutonic nations possessed a more or less
14349,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"elaborate social system, with various class gradations. These"
14350,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,gradations may be seen most clearly in the sums of money fixed for
14351,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"wergelds, for the compensations fixed for various injuries and"
14352,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,insults and for fines; in some cases also they show themselves in the
14353,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"relative value attached to oaths. Apart from slaves, who do not come"
14354,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"into consideration in these matters, the classes usually met with"
14355,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"are those of nobles, freemen and freedmen. Sometimes however a class"
14356,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,is subdivided; sometimes again one class is wanting altogether. Thus
14357,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"in the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, except Kent, there were two grades of"
14358,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"nobility, apparently landowning and landless, while freedmen did not"
14359,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,form a distinct class. Among the Franks on the other hand we find no
14360,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,noble class. In general the freeman's wergeld is about double that of
14361,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the freedman, while that of the noble is twice or thrice as great as"
14362,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the former; and the other payments usually follow more or less the same
14363,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,proportion. The actual sums fixed in the various laws differ greatly in
14364,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"each case, owing to the employment of different systems of currency."
14365,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,But it may be regarded as extremely probable that the normal wergeld
14366,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of the freeman was originally a hundred head of cattle. Some nations,"
14367,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"further, had special wergelds for certain high officials. Among the"
14368,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Franks persons _in truste regis_ had threefold wergelds, and the same"
14369,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,applied to the ordinary freeman when engaged in military service.
14370,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"In England the existence of special official wergelds is uncertain,"
14371,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"at least before the great Danish invasion, though such persons were"
14372,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,entitled to higher compensations in other respects. But in this country
14373,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,members of the royal families had wergelds six times as great as those
14374,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of the higher class of nobles.
14375,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14376,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,All the above classes (excluding officials of course) seem to have
14377,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,been as a rule hereditary. In some nations indeed the descendants
14378,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of freedmen did become freemen. But it is scarcely probable that
14379,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,this class everywhere consisted only of manumitted slaves or their
14380,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"offspring. Sometimes we find the terms _litus_, _latus_, _lazzus_"
14381,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,(_laet_ in the Kentish laws) in place of _libertus_; and there is good
14382,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,reason for believing that this class was largely derived from subject
14383,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,populations. Its numbers seem to have been very large. As to the
14384,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,numbers of the nobility there was apparently great difference between
14385,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,one nation and another. Among the Bavarians it consisted only of six
14386,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"families, including that of the duke, whereas in England it appears to"
14387,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,have formed a considerable element in the population. The term applied
14388,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"to it here was _gesiðcund_, i.e. of _gesið_ origin (cf. p. 350), which"
14389,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,indicates clearly a hereditary official or rather military class.
14390,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Indeed the evidence seems to show that the population consisted of
14391,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"two clearly defined classes, which we may describe as military and"
14392,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"agricultural, and that all serious fighting was left to the former."
14393,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,This is another feature in which Anglo-Saxon custom differed from
14394,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"that of the Franks, whose armies in the sixth century appear to have"
14395,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,been of a more truly national or even tribal character. With regard
14396,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to the other nations we have less information; but it is probable
14397,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that the military organisation of the Danes and other Baltic peoples
14398,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,approximated more nearly to the English type.

14401,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14402,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,In Homeric society we find the same forces operative as in that of the
14403,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Teutonic Heroic Age. The duty of protecting or avenging one's relatives
14404,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,is frequently mentioned. Thus in Od. XVI 97 f. the disguised Odysseus
14405,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"says to Telemachos: ""Hast thou fault to find with thy brethren, for"
14406,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"it is in them that a man trusts to do battle, even if a great quarrel"
14407,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"takes place?"" Telemachos replies (v. 115 ff.): ""Nor have I fault to"
14408,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"find with my brethren, in whom a man trusts to do battle, even if a"
14409,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,great quarrel takes place. For our family has been reduced to one man
14410,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"by the son of Cronos, as I will tell thee. Arceisios begat one only son"
14411,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Laertes, and Odysseus again was the only son begotten by his father;"
14412,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,but Odysseus begat me only and left me in his palace without profit to
14413,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"himself. Hence there are now innumerable enemies in our house."""
14414,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14415,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The duty of vengeance is clearly recognised by Nestor in Od. III 196
14416,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"ff.: ""How good a thing it is for even a dead man's child to survive!"
14417,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"For he (Orestes) also took vengeance on his father's slayer, the crafty"
14418,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Aigisthos, who killed his famous father."" It was in order to escape"
14419,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,such a fate that Theoclymenos besought Telemachos to take him on his
14420,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"ship (_ib._ XV 272 ff.): ""I also have left my country, having killed"
14421,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"a man of my own tribe (or 'people'). And in Argos, the pastureland of"
14422,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"horses, he had many brethren and kinsmen who hold great authority among"
14423,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the Achaeans. I have taken to flight and so evaded death and black fate
14424,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,at their hands; for it is still my lot to wander among men. Now take
14425,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"me on thy ship, since I have come to thee as a fugitive and suppliant,"
14426,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"lest they kill me outright; for I am sure they are in pursuit."" We"
14427,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"are reminded here of the story of Ecgtheo, the father of Beowulf, who"
14428,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,fled for protection to the Danish king Hrothgar owing to a similar
14429,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,cause (Beow. 459 ff.). Another case of such exile occurs in Il. XIII
14430,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"695 ff. (XV 334 ff.): ""He (Medon) dwelt in Phylace, away from his own"
14431,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"fatherland; for he had slain a man, the kinsman of his stepmother"
14432,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Eriopis, whom Oileus had to wife."" We may compare also Il. XV 430 ff."
14433,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"where Hector slays ""Lycophron, the son of Mastor, the Cytherian squire"
14434,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of Aias, who dwelt with him; for he had slain a man in divine Cythera."""
14435,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14436,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Among the Homeric Greeks, as in northern Europe, compensation for"
14437,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,manslaughter could be made to the dead man's relatives. Thus in Il. IX
14438,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"632 ff. Aias says to Achilles: ""And yet one accepts compensation from"
14439,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,a man who has slain one's brother or for the death of a son. Hence it
14440,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"comes to pass that the one, when he has paid a large compensation,"
14441,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"remains in his own land, while the other, after he has accepted the"
14442,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"compensation, restrains his feelings and his proud spirit."" Again, in"
14443,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the description of Achilles' shield we find a scene (_ib._ XVIII 497
14444,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"ff.) representing a dispute over the payment of a wergeld. ""The folk"
14445,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"were gathered in the assembly place; for there a strife was arisen,"
14446,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,two men striving about the blood-price of a man slain; the one claimed
14447,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"to pay full atonement, expounding to the people, but the other denied"
14448,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,him and would take naught; and both were fain to receive arbitrament
14449,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"at the hand of a daysman[521]."" In this case the transaction takes"
14450,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"place before certain elders, one of whom is to receive a payment of two"
14451,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"talents, apparently as a reward for bringing about an agreement. There"
14452,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,is no mention of any payment to the king[522].
14453,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14454,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,From the passage relating to Theoclymenos quoted above (v. 273: πολλοὶ
14455,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,κασίγνητοί τε ἔται τε) we may probably infer that the duty of vengeance
14456,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,extended beyond the brothers of the slain man; and evidence to the same
14457,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,effect is given by the story of Tlepolemos (Il. II 661 ff.). But it is
14458,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,not at all clear how many degrees of relationship were either involved
14459,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,in this duty or entitled to compensation. Indeed the poems give us very
14460,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,little information regarding the character of the kindred. Patronymic
14461,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,forms such as Ἀτρείδης[523] are very common and correspond in use
14462,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"to Anglo-Saxon forms such as _Hreðling_, _Wonreding_. But they are"
14463,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"almost always used of individuals or of a pair of brothers (Ἀτρείδα,"
14464,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"δοιοὶ Ἱππασίδαι). Collective names for families, such as Ἡρακλείδαι,"
14465,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Πελοπίδαι, seem not to occur in the Homeric poems[524]. Indeed the"
14466,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,patronymic is nearly always derived from the name of the father. Cases
14467,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"where they are taken from the grandfather's name, e.g. Αἰακίδης for"
14468,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Achilles, appear to be quite exceptional. This is a feature in which"
14469,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Homeric usage differs not only from Teutonic but also, still more,"
14470,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"from that of later times in Greece, where we frequently find families"
14471,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,or kindreds bearing patronymic names derived from a remote ancestor.
14472,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,As examples we may mention the Aigeidai at Sparta and the Philaidai at
14473,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Athens.
14474,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14475,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,But the difference between Homeric and later usage in this respect does
14476,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,not seem to be one of nomenclature only. At Athens we find later an
14477,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"elaborate system of 'tribes' (φυλαί), phratries or 'clans' (φράτραι)"
14478,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"and 'kindreds' (γένη), of which the last at all events were supposed"
14479,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"to rest on a basis of blood-relationship, involving common religious"
14480,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,rites. Divisions of a more or less similar type seem to have existed in
14481,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the other Greek states. In the Homeric poems however we find extremely
14482,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,little evidence for anything of this kind. The clearest case is in Il.
14483,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"II 362 f., where Nestor instructs Agamemnon as follows: ""Divide thy men"
14484,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"according to tribes and clans, Agamemnon, that clan may render succour"
14485,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"to clan and tribe to tribe[525]."" In the battle scenes we hear little"
14486,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of any such organisation, though this may be due to the fact that"
14487,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,attention is entirely concentrated upon the leaders. But it is worth
14488,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"noting that the word φρήτρη occurs only in this passage[526]. Again,"
14489,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"φυλή does not occur at all, except possibly in the form καταφυλαδόν"
14490,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"(Il. II 668), while φῦλον is a word of very vague significance, ranging"
14491,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"from φῦλα ἀνθρώπων etc. to the φῦλον Ἀρκεισίου, i.e. the descendants of"
14492,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,a man whose son is still alive[527]. The same is true also of γένος.
14493,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Lastly, there is no evidence for any religious rites peculiar to"
14494,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,certain families or clans.
14495,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14496,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,It would be rash of course to conclude from this that the clan and
14497,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,family system of later times was unknown in the age of the poems; for
14498,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,in itself it bears every mark of antiquity. But there must be some
14499,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,reason for the neglect with which it is treated in the poems. If we
14500,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,examine individual cases we find that scarcely any heroes claim an
14501,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,ancestry of more than three generations. The Achaean families with the
14502,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"longest history are those of Agamemnon and Odysseus; but, if we are"
14503,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"to believe post-Homeric tradition, the former changed its territories"
14504,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,after the time of Pelops.
14505,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14506,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,This brings us to the question of succession. In Ithaca the throne
14507,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"seems to pass in the regular paternal line; and, though there is really"
14508,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"no king after the retirement of Laertes, it is generally expected that"
14509,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the young Telemachos will eventually take his place (Od. I 386 f., II"
14510,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"14). Similarly Nestor has succeeded his father Neleus, while Idomeneus"
14511,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"apparently occupies the throne formerly held by his father's father,"
14512,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Minos. On the other hand, according to the story told by Glaucos (Il."
14513,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"VI 192 f.), Bellerophon, a stranger, received half the kingly rights in"
14514,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Lycia with the hand of the king's daughter. Moreover all post-Homeric
14515,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,authorities agree that Menelaos received the throne of Sparta by
14516,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"marriage, from his father-in-law Tyndareos. Similar stories are told"
14517,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of Tydeus, Telamon, Peleus, Teucros and many others[528]. It is to"
14518,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"be observed that, though these stories do not occur in the Iliad and"
14519,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Odyssey, they do not conflict with any evidence to be found there. Many"
14520,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of them can be traced back to the seventh century, indeed probably to"
14521,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the eighth.
14522,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14523,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,If we are to trust post-Homeric authorities it would seem that the
14524,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,wife remained in her parents' home quite as often as she went to that
14525,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of her husband. This state of things however points to the prevalence
14526,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of a cognatic organisation of society. In the case of Bellerophon
14527,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,indeed there can scarcely be any doubt; for the Lycians reckoned
14528,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,descent through the mother down to the time of Herodotus. The historian
14529,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,himself (I 173) remarks on the custom as strange and without parallel
14530,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,elsewhere--from which we may probably infer that it had disappeared
14531,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,altogether from Greece before his time. Yet in one Greek community we
14532,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"have evidence almost as explicit. According to Polybius, XII 5, the"
14533,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Epizephyrian Locrians stated that with them all ancestral honours were
14534,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"derived from women and not from men, and that even then (i.e. in the"
14535,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,second century) their nobility traced their descent from certain women
14536,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of 'the hundred families' who had taken part in the foundation of the
14537,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,colony. 'The hundred families' were those which before this time had
14538,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,been selected by the Locrians (i.e. the Hypocnemidian Locrians) as the
14539,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,families from which they were to choose the virgins who were to be sent
14540,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to Ilion. This story seems to imply that cognatic organisation survived
14541,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,in Locris down to the beginning of the seventh century[529]. In other
14542,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"states[530], so far as I am aware, we find only traces of the former"
14543,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,existence of such an institution. Some of these however suggest that
14544,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the change may not have been of any very great antiquity[531].
14545,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14546,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"The Homeric poems themselves contain some further evidence, which"
14547,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,points in the same direction. We may note that a number of heroes are
14548,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,said to be sons of gods. But it can hardly be without significance that
14549,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the Lycian prince Sarpedon (daughter's son of Bellerophon) is the only
14550,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"son of Zeus, who belongs to the story of the Trojan war, whereas in the"
14551,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,earlier generations examples are comparatively common. In post-Homeric
14552,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,genealogies the succession of son to father seems to become less
14553,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,frequent the farther one goes back.
14554,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14555,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,In regard to marriage customs the poems show a remarkable absence of
14556,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,uniformity. The story of Bellerophon is by no means the only case
14557,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"in which the wife remains at home, even if we leave out of account"
14558,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"such marriages as those of Menelaos and Tydeus, upon which the poems"
14559,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,themselves are silent. Alcinoos proposes a union of this kind to
14560,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Odysseus (Od. VII 311 ff.)[532], and the wife of Iphidamas the son of"
14561,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Antenor appears to remain with her father (Il. XI 225 f.). On the whole
14562,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,however the other type seems to be decidedly more common. Then we have
14563,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to take into account the use of the word ἔεδνα. It is commonly held
14564,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that this originally denoted the 'bride-price' paid by the bridegroom
14565,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to the relatives of the bride; and there is no doubt that the word
14566,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,is so used in several passages. In others however it may at least
14567,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,equally well denote presents made to the bride herself; occasionally
14568,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,indeed it appears to mean presents (i.e. a dowry) given by the bride's
14569,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,parents. By far the most prominent case of course is that of Penelope;
14570,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,and here the question is complicated apparently by a doubt as to the
14571,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,proper person entitled to bestow the bride--who is presumed to be a
14572,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"widow. Sometimes the decision seems to rest with her son, Telemachos,"
14573,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,sometimes with her father--never with Laertes; but in the end she takes
14574,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the matter into her own hands, after exacting presents for herself from"
14575,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,all the suitors. It has been well suggested[533] that the ambiguity in
14576,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the situation is due to a real change of custom. But I am by no means
14577,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"convinced that the ancient custom, now being superseded, was one of"
14578,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"real purchase. It is made fairly clear (Od. I 396 ff., XV 518 ff., XXII"
14579,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"49 ff., etc.) that at least some of the suitors have ulterior objects"
14580,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,in view. That the throne should be conveyed through Penelope seems to
14581,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,us no doubt illogical; for Odysseus himself had not acquired it by his
14582,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"marriage. But, if we are right in believing that the type of marriage"
14583,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"represented in the story of Bellerophon is earlier than the other, the"
14584,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,situation depicted in the Odyssey is one for which ancient custom could
14585,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,not have made provision; indeed in such a situation traditional feeling
14586,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"might very well incline towards regarding the queen, even though a"
14587,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"stranger, as the proper channel for conveying the succession. Add to"
14588,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,this the practical consideration that Penelope is apparently the person
14589,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"actually in command of the treasury; and we have no reason, so far as I"
14590,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"am aware, for doubting that treasury and kingdom were as closely bound"
14591,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,up together in Heroic Greece as they were in the Heroic Age of the
14592,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,northern peoples[534]. It has often been remarked that the position of
14593,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,women in the Homeric poems appears to be one of greater influence and
14594,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,responsibility than anything we find in later times. But nowhere is
14595,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,this responsibility made so clear as in the absence of all evidence for
14596,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the constitution of a regency when the king is away from home.
14597,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14598,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,If the view put forward above is correct we must conclude that a change
14599,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"had been taking place in the organisation of society, and indeed"
14600,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that it was as yet by no means complete[535]. We have noticed that
14601,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the conditions seem to have been somewhat similar in the Heroic Age
14602,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of the Teutonic peoples. But we saw also that there the change was
14603,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"apparently accompanied by a relaxation in the bonds of kinship, which"
14604,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,shows itself especially in fatal strife between relatives. The same
14605,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,phenomenon appears in the Homeric poems. Thus according to Il. II 662
14606,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"f. Tlepolemos slew his father's mother's brother, Licymnios, and had"
14607,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to leave his country in consequence. Among Achilles' followers (_ib._
14608,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,XVI 570 ff.) was a certain Epeigeus who had taken refuge with Peleus
14609,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,because he had killed a cousin or kinsman (ἀνεψιός) in his own city.
14610,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Again in Il. IX 566 f. it is at least implied that Meleagros slew his
14611,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,mother's brothers (in accordance with the story found later). In the
14612,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,same speech (V 458 ff.) Phoinix confesses that he had been on the point
14613,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of killing his own father. Then there is the tragic history of the
14614,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,house of Pelops. The facts stated in the Odyssey are that Aigisthos
14615,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"slew Agamemnon, his father's brother's son, and that Orestes, the son"
14616,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of Agamemnon, eventually slew Aigisthos. The most important feature in"
14617,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,this story is that here we have not only homicide but also vengeance
14618,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,within the kindred. It is not actually stated that Orestes slew his
14619,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,mother; but from Od. III 310 we may infer at least that she perished at
14620,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the same time as Aigisthos. This is one of the cases in which I suspect
14621,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that disagreeable incidents connected with royal families have been
14622,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,suppressed (cf. p. 238). Later authorities add many more instances of
14623,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"homicide within the kindred. Some of these, such as the 'banquet of"
14624,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Thyestes,' bear a close resemblance to Teutonic stories which we know"
14625,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to be unhistorical. Others again may have been invented to account
14626,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,for the presence of heroes in districts far from their native place.
14627,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Yet from the fact that this motive is so frequently employed we may
14628,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,conclude that the murder of relatives was nothing very rare.
14629,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14630,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,In this respect then the Greek evidence agrees entirely with the
14631,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Teutonic. In both cases alike the bonds of kinship seem to have lost
14632,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,their force to a great extent[536]. But it is to be remembered that
14633,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,among the Teutonic peoples we have in general no evidence except for
14634,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the families of kings and royal officials; in other ranks of society
14635,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the kindred may have retained much more vitality--as indeed the
14636,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,laws seem to imply. Such may also have been the case in Greece; for
14637,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the Homeric poems are concerned almost exclusively with persons of
14638,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,princely rank. Certainly the strength and sanctity possessed by the
14639,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,kindred in early historical times is most easily to be explained on the
14640,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,supposition that the tendency which we have been discussing affected
14641,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,only a limited element in society[537].
14642,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14643,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The second of the two principles which we find dominant in early
14644,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Teutonic society, namely that of personal allegiance, seems at first"
14645,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,sight to play by no means so important a part in the life of heroic
14646,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Greece. But for the lack of prominence assigned to it there are special
14647,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"reasons--a different reason in the case of each poem. In the Iliad,"
14648,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"which deals with campaign life, the stage is so crowded with kings that"
14649,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,there is little room left for persons of humbler station. The only
14650,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,force indeed of which we have any account at all is that of Achilles.
14651,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"This was divided into five troops, each under a leader of its own, in"
14652,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,addition to Patroclos and Automedon. We saw in the last chapter that
14653,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the speech in which Patroclos exhorts his men to battle is entirely in
14654,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the spirit of the Teutonic _comitatus_. The appeal which he makes to
14655,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"them is not to any feeling of patriotism, but entirely to the effect"
14656,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that they should show their devotion to their own lord. We may note
14657,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"that several of the chief men, at all events Patroclos, Automedon and"
14658,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Phoinix, seem to share Achilles' hut. The passionate friendship of"
14659,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Achilles and Patroclos appears to be a stronger bond than any other
14660,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,relationship that we meet with in the Homeric poems. But even if we
14661,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"set this on one side as something exceptional, the devotion shown to"
14662,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Achilles by Phoinix is quite in accordance with the best traditions of
14663,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Teutonic thegnship.
14664,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14665,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The Odyssey presents us with the picture of a king's house in time of
14666,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"peace. But, though Penelope has not less than fifty women in the house,"
14667,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the only men apparently, besides the suitors and their followers, are"
14668,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Telemachos himself, the herald Medon and the minstrel Phemios, together"
14669,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"with the swineherd, neatherd and goatherd who come with provisions"
14670,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,each day from a distance. But the conditions here are abnormal; the
14671,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"king himself has been away from home for many years, and his son is"
14672,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,only just reaching manhood. It is scarcely credible that a Teutonic
14673,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,_comitatus_ could have existed under such conditions. Menelaos appears
14674,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to have something of a retinue at his court. In IV 22 f. we hear of a
14675,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"θεράπων named Eteoneus, who seems to be a person of some rank, as he is"
14676,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"called κρείων. In v. 216 f. another θεράπων, Asphalion, is mentioned,"
14677,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"while v. 37 f. speak of several of such persons, though their number"
14678,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,is not stated. All that is said of them seems to indicate that their
14679,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,position was much the same as that of the thegns in early Teutonic
14680,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,courts. The picture of the Phaeacian court also bears a general
14681,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,resemblance to that of the Danish court as described in Beowulf.
14682,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14683,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The use of the word θεράπων appears to correspond almost exactly to
14684,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that of _þegn_[538]. In both cases the general meaning is 'servant';
14685,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"but, just as we find Beowulf described as _Hygelaces þegn_, so in the"
14686,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Iliad the term θεράπων is applied to such distinguished persons as
14687,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Meriones and Patroclos. The converse term ἄναξ also seems to correspond
14688,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,almost as closely to the English _dryhten_. Like the latter it is used
14689,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"for the master of a slave (e.g. Od. XV 557), while on the other hand"
14690,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"it is applied, again like _dryhten_, to the most important kings--and"
14691,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,even deities--in relation to all who recognise their authority. We
14692,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,have already noticed (p. 329) that the phrase ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν seems to
14693,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,correspond very closely to the English phrase _eorla dryhten_.
14694,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14695,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,There is little or no evidence to show whether it was customary for the
14696,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,sons of leading men to be brought up at the king's court. Patroclos was
14697,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,declared to be the θεράπων of Achilles at an early age (Il. XXIII 89
14698,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,f.); but the circumstances were exceptional. Certainly the θεράποντες
14699,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,often came from beyond the king's dominions. Thus Patroclos had come
14700,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"from Opus (_ib._ XXIII 85 ff.) and Lycophron, Aias' squire, from"
14701,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Cythera (_ib._ XV 430 f.). It is true that both these persons had had
14702,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to leave their homes owing to homicides which they had committed; and
14703,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,no doubt many such cases were due to circumstances which rendered a
14704,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,change of abode advisable. Thus Phoinix had sought the protection of
14705,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Peleus owing to a deadly quarrel with his father. Yet apart from such
14706,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,emergencies the protection and friendship of a wealthy and powerful
14707,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,king probably offered considerable attractions. We may refer to a
14708,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"somewhat remarkable passage in the Odyssey (IV 174 ff.), where Menelaos"
14709,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"says that it had been his wish to bring Odysseus to his own country,"
14710,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"with his son and his followers and possessions, adding that in order to"
14711,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,make a home for him he would have ejected the inhabitants from one of
14712,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the neighbouring cities which were under his lordship.
14713,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14714,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Menelaos' intention seems to have been to put Odysseus in the position
14715,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of a dependent prince. We have seen that Teutonic kings were in the
14716,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,habit of rewarding their knights with grants of jurisdiction; and the
14717,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,same appears to have been the case with the kings of Homeric times.
14718,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Thus in Il. IX 483 f. Phoinix says that Peleus had made him rich and
14719,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"granted him many followers, and that he had made his dwelling in a"
14720,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,frontier district as lord over the Dolopes. This passage seems to
14721,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,furnish almost an exact parallel to the treatment of Beowulf by Hygelac
14722,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"(cf. p. 349). A similar case perhaps was that of Medon, the son of"
14723,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Oileus, who according to Il. II 727 commanded the forces from Methone"
14724,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"and the adjacent districts, in the absence of Philoctetes, and who,"
14725,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"like Phoinix, was a fugitive from his native land (cf. XIII 695 ff.)."
14726,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Here too we may mention the case of Phyleus, who had left his own"
14727,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,country and gone to Dulichion owing to a quarrel with his father (_ib._
14728,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"II 629), and whose son Meges commanded the forces from that island."
14729,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,In many such cases of course there may have been a marriage with a
14730,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,princess of the native royal family; but it is hardly necessary to
14731,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,assume that this was universal. In the case of Phoinix indeed such an
14732,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,assumption is improbable.
14733,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14734,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,There seems to be no actual record of a Homeric hero who left his
14735,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"home except under stress of circumstances; and hence, after making"
14736,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"all deductions, we are bound, I think, to conclude that the system"
14737,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of the _comitatus_ was not so highly developed as in the north of
14738,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Europe. This is in full conformity with the fact that kingly families
14739,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,were apparently much more numerous. Among the suitors of Penelope
14740,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"twelve princes belong to Ithaca alone, an island of no great size and"
14741,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,probably never thickly populated[539].
14742,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14743,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,For a class of nobility distinct from the princely families we have no
14744,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"clear evidence[540]. Persons like Eteoneus, the squire of Menelaos, may"
14745,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,belong to such a class; but it is quite possible that they are princes.
14746,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,We may refer also to the false story told by Odysseus in Od. XIII 256
14747,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"ff., from which it appears that chiefs with small followings might be"
14748,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,expected to place themselves in the position of θεράποντες to more
14749,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,powerful chiefs. But Odysseus does not here make clear what rank he
14750,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,claims to have possessed in Crete. Quite possibly the practice referred
14751,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to might be somewhat analogous to what we find in the Saga of Harold
14752,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the Fair-haired, where a number of petty kings submit to Harold and"
14753,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,take the rank of earls.
14754,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14755,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The same want of definiteness occurs in regard to the humbler ranks of
14756,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"society. Even the slave's status is not made particularly clear, while"
14757,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,there is no reference to the existence of freedmen or to the practice
14758,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of manumission[541]. Slaves are apparently able to buy other slaves
14759,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,on their own account (cf. Od. XIV 449 ff.). In other respects however
14760,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,their position seems to be very similar to that of slaves in early
14761,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Teutonic society[542]. Still less do we hear of differences of rank
14762,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,or status within the free population[543]. But it should be observed
14763,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that the Anglo-Saxon poems give us no more information on such matters.
14764,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Were it not for the early laws and foreign authorities we should know
14765,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"nothing of the distinction between land-holding and landless peasants,"
14766,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"nor even of the great classes of noble, freeman, slave, etc. The true"
14767,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,explanation seems to be that both sets of poems alike are interested
14768,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,only in persons of royal rank.
14769,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14770,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,No light is thrown on the social system by the passages which mention
14771,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the payment of wergelds; for we are not informed whether these were
14772,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,fixed by custom or whether they formed the subject of bargaining in
14773,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,each individual case. In Il. XXI 79 f. Lycaon says that Achilles had
14774,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,sold him into Lemnos for a hundred oxen and that he had been ransomed
14775,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,from thence for three hundred. Even the smaller of these sums is of
14776,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,course much too great for an ordinary slave's price. In the light of
14777,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Teutonic custom it is possible that both represent standard wergelds,"
14778,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,regarded as man-values in general; but one can hardly say that it is
14779,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,more than a possibility. The silence of the poems upon this subject is
14780,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"nothing surprising, for the Teutonic poems yield us no more information."
14781,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14782,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,*       *       *       *       *
14783,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14784,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,We may now briefly summarise the results of this discussion. The
14785,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"salient characteristic of the Heroic Age, both in Greece and in"
14786,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"northern Europe, appears to be the disintegration of the bonds of"
14787,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"kinship, a process which shows itself chiefly in the prevalence of"
14788,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"strife between relatives, and which in both cases is probably connected"
14789,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,with a change in the organisation of the kindred--agnatic relationship
14790,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,having come gradually to take the place of cognatic. How far this
14791,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"process affected society as a whole we cannot tell, since our evidence"
14792,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,is generally limited to the royal families. The binding force formerly
14793,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,possessed by kinship was now largely transferred to the relationship
14794,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"between 'lord' and 'man' (_dryhten_--_þegn_, ἄναξ--θεράπων), between"
14795,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,whom no bond of blood-relationship was necessary. The _comitatus_
14796,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,was probably not developed in Greece to the same extent as it was in
14797,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,northern Europe; indeed in regard to social development generally
14798,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the conditions in Greece seem to have been more primitive. Yet in
14799,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,individual cases the bond between lord and man was apparently the
14800,SOCIETY IN THE HEROIC AGE.,strongest force of which we know.

14897,FOOTNOTES:,
14898,FOOTNOTES:,[535] That the type of organisation which prevailed during the growth

14903,FOOTNOTES:,Cretans used μητρίς for πατρίς. Evidence for the prevalence of cognatic
14904,FOOTNOTES:,organisation in early times is furnished by certain words denoting
14905,FOOTNOTES:,"relationship, especially ἀδελφός (originally 'uterine brother'), and a"
14906,FOOTNOTES:,relic of the feeling that this form of relationship was closer seems to
14907,FOOTNOTES:,be preserved in Il. XXI 95. We may also take into account the formation
14908,FOOTNOTES:,"of patronymics in -ιδᾱ, which appear to be extended from the feminine"
14909,FOOTNOTES:,suffix -ιδ- by another suffix (-ᾱ-) also properly feminine. In the
14910,FOOTNOTES:,north-western dialects these names were declined as feminines (e.g. N.
14911,FOOTNOTES:,"sg. Εχσοιδα, G. sg. Προκλειδας). One can hardly help suspecting that"

14913,FOOTNOTES:,
14914,FOOTNOTES:,[536] It is possibly due to the same cause that we meet with some

14957,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14958,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14959,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,During the Heroic Age of the Teutonic peoples kingship appears to have
14960,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,been practically universal. The Old Saxons may have formed a solitary
14961,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,exception to the general rule; but our knowledge of this people really
14962,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,begins only towards the close of the seventh century.
14963,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14964,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Much has been written about the various powers possessed by the kings,"
14965,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"but it is still by no means clear what they could not do, so long as"
14966,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,they had a powerful and contented body of personal followers. If they
14967,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,forfeited the allegiance of their retinues by violence or outrage their
14968,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,power of course was gone at once. In the course of the eighth century
14969,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,several English kings were killed or expelled by their retinues; and
14970,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,in Beowulf (v. 902 ff.; cf. v. 1709 ff.) we hear that a former king
14971,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of the Danes named Heremod had met with a similar fate. But in early
14972,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"times such cases do not seem to have been common. Again, the numbers"
14973,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of the retinue might decrease through want of generosity or excessive
14974,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"love of peace on the king's part, and he would then be exposed to"
14975,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the attack of any aggressive neighbour or of some member of his own
14976,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,family whom he had offended. The only definite statement however
14977,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,which we possess regarding a limitation of the king's authority is a
14978,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,passage in Ammianus Marcellinus' history (XXVIII 5. 14) referring to
14979,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the Burgundians--before their conversion--according to which kings
14980,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,were regularly deposed as a consequence of unsuccessful war or famine.
14981,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"The context, though not plainly expressed, seems to suggest that this"
14982,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,deposition was carried out by the decision or through the agency of a
14983,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,high-priest whose authority was permanent.
14984,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
14985,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The statement that the kings of the Burgundians were deposed on account
14986,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of famine points to the survival of a primitive idea of kingship,"
14987,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,which credited the ruler with superhuman powers. The kings of the
14988,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Swedes also, according to Ynglinga Saga, cap. 47, were believed to"
14989,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"have control over the seasons[544], like the god Frey from whom they"
14990,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,claimed descent; and it is said that two of them were sacrificed in
14991,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"times of famine. In the same saga, cap. 20, it is stated that the"
14992,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"members of this dynasty individually were called Yngvi, a name of the"
14993,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,ancestral god[545]--which seems to indicate that they were regarded
14994,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,as his representatives. How far such ideas were general during the
14995,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Heroic Age it is impossible to say, owing to the fact that we have"
14996,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,few records dating in their present form from heathen times. Note
14997,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,may be taken however of the peculiar position occupied by the later
14998,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Merovingian kings[546]. During the last century of their existence as
14999,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,a dynasty their power was entirely taken from them and transferred
15000,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to a viceroy (commonly known as _maior domus_)--whose office became
15001,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,practically hereditary in one family. The only duties which were
15002,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"retained by the kings were certain ceremonial functions, which point to"
15003,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"a more or less sacral character, so far as was possible in a Christian"
15004,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,community. We may note further that in the North there is no evidence
15005,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,for a specifically priestly class; temporal and spiritual power were
15006,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,apparently united in the same person. Among the Angli on the other hand
15007,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"there was such a class, though, in contrast with the Burgundians, the"
15008,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,high-priest seems to have been subordinate to the king[547].
15009,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15010,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"In Sweden there was a form of election for kings, which may have had"
15011,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,a religious significance. The electors (the lawman and twelve others
15012,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"from each province) stood on huge stones (Morastenar), fixed in the"
15013,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"earth, which may still be seen at Hammarby near Upsala. Saxo (p. 10"
15014,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,f.) records the former existence of a similar custom in Denmark. On
15015,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the other hand the Frankish custom of hoisting a new king on a shield
15016,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"probably meant no more than a proclamation of lordship, as may be"
15017,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,seen from the first recorded instance[548]. Whatever the formalities
15018,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"employed, it appears that in practice the reigning king was usually"
15019,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,able to secure the succession for his son; but failing such the nearest
15020,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,male relative acceptable to the court would normally be chosen[549]. It
15021,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,was not an unknown thing even for minors to succeed[550]. Frequently we
15022,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"find the kingdom shared by two or more brothers, just like any other"
15023,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,property; and on the death of one of them his son was sometimes allowed
15024,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"to take his place, as in the well-known case of Hrothgar and Hrothwulf."
15025,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"On the other hand the survivor might, and apparently often did, refuse"
15026,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,any such concession; and consequently struggles between relatives for
15027,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the possession of the throne were of not infrequent occurrence.
15028,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15029,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,National or tribal assemblies figure prominently in Tacitus' account
15030,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of the ancient Germans, and among several of the Continental Teutonic"
15031,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,peoples they survived down to the seventh or eighth century. At this
15032,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,time they were generally held in the early spring--whence the name
15033,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,_Campus Martius_ applied to the assembly of the Franks. After the
15034,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,adoption of Christianity however they had come to be little more than
15035,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"military reviews for the most part, though at the same time a meeting"
15036,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of dignitaries, lay and ecclesiastical, was held for the transaction"
15037,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of business. In much later times we meet with national assemblies in
15038,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the North also, especially in Sweden, and there can be little doubt"
15039,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that these had long been in existence. They were used by the kings for
15040,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the purpose of publishing proclamations, and at the same time they"
15041,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,presented an opportunity for coercing or overthrowing a king who had
15042,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,aroused popular resentment in any way. But they appear to have been
15043,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"primarily religious gatherings, for the great annual sacrifices at the"
15044,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,chief national sanctuary. It is more than probable however that such
15045,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,was the case also with the assemblies of the ancient Germans[551].
15046,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"At all events there is nothing to show that, apart from special"
15047,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"emergencies, they met more than once, or possibly twice, in the year."
15048,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,In England evidence seems to be altogether wanting for any assemblies
15049,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,which could properly be called national; nor do we find any reference
15050,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to such an institution in the poems.
15051,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15052,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,It is true that we hear not unfrequently of discussions and
15053,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,deliberations in works dating from the Heroic Age. But although precise
15054,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,information as to the size and constitution of these meetings is seldom
15055,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"given, they appear to be those of comparatively small bodies, similar"
15056,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to the royal councils of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. The latter however
15057,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,were nothing more than meetings of the court from the earliest times
15058,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to which our records go back. When important questions were discussed
15059,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,care may have been taken to summon all the leading men; and no doubt
15060,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"age and high rank ensured priority of hearing, as in the assemblies"
15061,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of Tacitus' day. But still they remained essentially meetings of the
15062,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"king's personal dependents. So far as I am aware, there is no reason"
15063,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,for supposing that gatherings like that described by Procopius (_Vand._
15064,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"I 22), when Genseric received the embassy from his compatriots in"
15065,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Europe, differed in any way from the meeting called by Edwin in 625 to"
15066,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,discuss the adoption of Christianity. Often indeed the persons present
15067,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"are described as οἱ λόγιμοι or λογιμώτατοι. Again, in Beowulf we hear"
15068,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"more than once of Danish councillors (_witan Scyldinga_), but there is"
15069,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,nothing to show that these were a different body from the members of
15070,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the court who entertained Beowulf; and it is clear from vv. 778 ff.,"
15071,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,936 ff. that their meetings were held in the same building. The old
15072,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,and distinguished councillor who persuaded Genseric to reject the
15073,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,petition of the envoys would seem to have been just such another person
15074,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"as Aeschere, Hrothgar's trusted adviser (cf. p. 350). In the story of"
15075,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Hermegisklos and Radiger also (cf. p. 97 f.) it is clear that the same
15076,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"'distinguished men of the nation' (οἱ λόγιμοι, λογιμώτατοι) act both as"
15077,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,companions of the old king and advisers of his young successor.
15078,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15079,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,In spite of what has been said above there is some evidence for the
15080,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"existence of councils consisting of a fixed number of men, namely"
15081,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"twelve, whose position may have differed somewhat from that of the"
15082,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,ordinary members of the court[552]. The Old Saxons had a council of
15083,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"twelve which met annually at a place called Marklo, on the Weser; but"
15084,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"this case stands by itself, as the Old Saxons had no king. In Sweden"
15085,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,however we meet with such councils both in tradition and in historical
15086,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"times, and what we know of them indicates that they were composed"
15087,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of the chief men. Moreover councils of twelve for judicial purposes
15088,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,occur both in provinces and small districts in various parts of the
15089,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Scandinavian peninsula, as well as in the Scandinavian settlements in"
15090,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the British Isles. The gods too were credited with possessing a council
15091,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of twelve which had both judicial and sacrificial duties[553]--a fact
15092,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,which is interesting as it points to a connection between the councils
15093,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of which we have been speaking and bodies of twelve with sacrificial
15094,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"duties, of which we hear in stories relating to heathen times. If we"
15095,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,take into account the legend of the twelve Frisian judges (_asegen_)
15096,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,and the fact that councils of twelve are known to have existed among
15097,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the Celts and other European peoples, we can scarcely doubt that"
15098,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,this type is of great antiquity. Yet there is nothing to show that
15099,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,such councils were at all general during the Heroic Age; in England
15100,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,they seem to be entirely unknown before the period of Scandinavian
15101,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"influence. It is probable therefore that in this, as in other respects,"
15102,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the Swedes had preserved an institution which other kingdoms had
15103,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,discarded.
15104,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15105,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,From the stories quoted above we see that it was customary for the king
15106,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to consult his council or court when any question involving difficulty
15107,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,or danger arose; and there can be little doubt that he would feel his
15108,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,position strengthened by so doing. But we have no reason for supposing
15109,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that the opinion of the council possessed anything more than moral
15110,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,force; and consequently it would depend upon the king's strength of
15111,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,character or the security of his position whether he felt himself bound
15112,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to follow their advice or not. Procopius (_Goth._ I 2) states that
15113,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Amalaswintha was coerced by the leading men of the Goths with regard
15114,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"to her son's education; but she was only a regent at this time. Again,"
15115,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"in another passage (_ib._ IV 27) he relates how Hildigisl, a claimant"
15116,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"to the Langobardic throne, fled for refuge to Thorisin (Turisindus),"
15117,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"king of the Gepidae. Audoin, king of the Langobardi, demanded that"
15118,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,he should be given up; and his request was supported by Justinian.
15119,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Thorisin consulted his distinguished men (οἱ λόγιμοι), but they replied"
15120,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that it would be better for the whole nation of the Gepidae to perish
15121,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"than to commit such an act of sacrilege. The king now, says Procopius,"
15122,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,felt himself to be in a great difficulty. For he could not carry out
15123,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"what was demanded against the will of his subjects, and at the same"
15124,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,time he was afraid to go to war against the Romans and Langobardi. So
15125,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"he contrived to get the fugitive murdered secretly, obtaining a _quid"
15126,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,pro quo_ in the murder of one of his own rivals. It must be observed
15127,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that Thorisin himself had obtained the throne by violence. So the young
15128,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Radiger, when he was captured and brought before the English princess,"
15129,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,pleaded that he had been forced to renounce his promise to her by
15130,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,his father's commands and the insistence of the leading men (τὴν τῶν
15131,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,ἀρχόντων σπουδήν). Genseric on the other hand dismissed the envoys in
15132,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,accordance with the old councillor's advice; but we are told that both
15133,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of them were ridiculed by the rest of the Vandals for so doing. Plainly
15134,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,then there was no question of having to follow the opinion of the
15135,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,majority.
15136,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15137,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,It might naturally be expected that the authority of the council would
15138,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,make itself felt most on the occasion of the king's death; and the
15139,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,story of Radiger seems to bear this out. Yet it is worth noticing what
15140,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"is recorded in Beowulf on an occasion of great emergency. Hygelac,"
15141,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"king of the Geatas, lost his life in the disastrous expedition against"
15142,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the Frisians and left an only son, Heardred, who seems to have been"
15143,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"scarcely more than a child. Beowulf escaped from the slaughter, and"
15144,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"on his return (v. 2369 ff.) ""Hygd offered him the treasury and the"
15145,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"government, the rings and the throne. She trusted not that her child"
15146,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"would be able to hold his patrimony against foreign nations, now that"
15147,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Hygelac was dead."" There is no reference to any action on the part"
15148,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of the council or court; but the queen offers the throne to the late
15149,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,king's nephew. The whole passage seems to indicate that the throne
15150,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,with all its rights was regarded very much like any ordinary family
15151,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"property. Its disposition is arranged by the family itself, without"
15152,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,any notion of responsibility to others; and the members of the court
15153,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,are not taken into account any more than the servants in a private
15154,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,household.
15155,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15156,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,It may perhaps be argued that court poets would be apt to exaggerate
15157,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the power of the royal family and consequently that the picture of
15158,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"its authority given here is misleading. Yet Amalaswintha, who was a"
15159,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"contemporary of Hygelac, appears to have acted on her own authority"
15160,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"when she associated Theodahath, the nephew of Theodric, in the"
15161,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,sovereignty with herself after her son's death. There is other evidence
15162,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,also which goes to show that this passage truly reflects the spirit
15163,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of the times. In the story of Radiger we see how a young princess
15164,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,was able to gather together a huge army and bring about a sanguinary
15165,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,struggle between two nations on account of an insult offered to her
15166,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"by a neighbouring king. Again, Paulus Diaconus (_Hist. Lang._ I 20)"
15167,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,states that the war between the Heruli and the Langobardi was due to
15168,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the murder of the Herulian king's brother by a Langobardic princess.
15169,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Even if this story is untrue, it is significant enough that it should"
15170,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,obtain credit. To the prominent part played by women in determining the
15171,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,destinies of nations we have already alluded (p. 337 f.). In particular
15172,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"we may call attention to the position of Fredegond and Brunhild, who"
15173,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,after the deaths of their husbands practically ruled the kingdom of
15174,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the Franks. In the seventh century Hygd's action in disposing of the
15175,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"kingdom is easily outdone by Sexburg, the widow of the West Saxon king"
15176,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Coenwalh, who is said to have kept the throne for herself."
15177,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15178,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,There is no doubt of course that the ease with which kings and princes
15179,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,were able to draw their nations into war was due largely to the
15180,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,restless spirit which animated their retinues. Sometimes indeed they
15181,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,appear to have been drawn into war against their own inclination.
15182,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Procopius (_Goth._ II 14) differs from Paulus Diaconus in the cause
15183,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,which he assigns for the outbreak of the war between the Heruli and
15184,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Langobardi. According to him it was due entirely to the fact that the
15185,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Heruli could not endure a peace of more than three years duration,"
15186,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,and consequently forced their king into hostilities. The Frankish
15187,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,king Lothair I is said by Gregory (IV 14) to have been driven into a
15188,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,disastrous campaign against the Saxons from the same cause. In this
15189,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,direction then we may certainly recognise the influence of the court;
15190,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"but the pressure probably came not from the old councillors, but from"
15191,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the younger men who hoped to gain riches and glory thereby.
15192,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15193,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,This brings us to the question of international relations. What is
15194,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"said in the opening verses of Beowulf regarding Scyld Scefing, the"
15195,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"eponymous ancestor of the Danish royal family, may probably be taken as"
15196,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,a standard description of a typical successful king of the Heroic Age:
15197,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"""He deprived many dynasties of their banqueting halls ... and gained"
15198,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"glory after glory, until every one of his neighbours across the whale's"
15199,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"road had to obey him and pay him tribute."" With increasing wealth"
15200,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"however the love of peace frequently reasserted itself, especially"
15201,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"perhaps towards the end of the period, by which time the kingdoms had"
15202,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,materially decreased in number and consequently increased in size.
15203,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,We now see alliances more and more taking the place of conquest.
15204,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Theodric organised an alliance not only with the Visigoths but also
15205,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"with the kings of the Thuringians, Heruli and Warni, which extended his"
15206,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,influence from the Mediterranean to the North Sea; and his name seems
15207,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to have carried weight as far as the eastern part of the Baltic. In
15208,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Beowulf too we see the nations of the Baltic dealing with one another
15209,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,for the most part on friendly terms.
15210,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15211,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,That such alliances were primarily of a personal rather than a national
15212,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,character is shown in two ways. In the first place they were often
15213,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,cemented by marriage. Thus two of Theodric's daughters were married to
15214,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Alaric, king of the Visigoths, and Sigismund, king of the Burgundians,"
15215,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"respectively, his sister to Thrasamund, king of the Vandals, and his"
15216,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"niece to Irminfrith, king of the Thuringians, while Theodric himself"
15217,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,married a sister of Clovis. We have seen (p. 98) that similar marriages
15218,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"were contracted by the kings of the Warni, while the Frankish royal"
15219,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,family was intermarried with those of practically all the surrounding
15220,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"nations. In the North the same custom seems to have prevailed, for"
15221,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"in Beowulf one of the Swedish kings, probably Onela, is married to a"
15222,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,sister of the Danish king Hrothgar. The term _friðuwebbe_ (usually
15223,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"interpreted as 'weaver of peace'), which we find applied to ladies of"
15224,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"royal rank in Anglo-Saxon poetry, probably owes its origin to this bond"
15225,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of union between kingly families. Such marriages seem to have sometimes
15226,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"taken place after a war, as in the case of Ingeld and Freawaru in"
15227,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Beowulf.
15228,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15229,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Secondly, we hear of kings entering into a relationship called"
15230,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,'fatherhood' and 'sonship' with other kings. For an example we may
15231,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"cite one of Cassiodorus' letters (_Var._ IV 2), addressed to a king"
15232,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of the Heruli and informing him that Theodric creates him his 'son in
15233,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"arms' (_filius per arma_), which is a great honour[554]. The letter is"
15234,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,accompanied by a valuable present of arms and horses. Parallels are to
15235,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"be found in much later times. We may refer to the Saxon Chronicle, ann."
15236,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"924, where the Scottish king (Constantine II) and several other princes"
15237,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,in northern Britain accept Edward the Elder as 'father and lord.' It
15238,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,is scarcely to be doubted that in such cases the 'son' is expected
15239,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to render assistance to the 'father' when required. The king of the
15240,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Heruli appears to have been in alliance with Theodric[555], while"
15241,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Malcolm I, the successor of Constantine II, was under an engagement"
15242,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"with Edmund to be his ""cooperator both by sea and by land[556]."" The"
15243,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,_imperium_ which Bede (_H. E._ II 5) ascribes to several English kings
15244,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,in all probability involved somewhat similar obligations; and it rested
15245,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"without doubt upon an acceptance of lordship, if not of fatherhood."
15246,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15247,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,After the establishment of overlordship the next stage is that in
15248,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,which the smaller kingdoms are annexed and incorporated by the larger
15249,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,ones--generally in consequence of a revolt. The place of the native
15250,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,king or kings is often taken at first by a member of the victorious
15251,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"dynasty; but such arrangements were seldom lasting, and before long the"
15252,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,national organisation was abolished. The completion of this process
15253,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,on the Continent belongs of course to times subsequent to the Heroic
15254,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Age, while in this country it took place still later. But we can see"
15255,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,such changes going on within the Heroic Age itself. At the end of the
15256,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,period the number of Teutonic kingdoms on the Continent was quite
15257,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"small. Several however, such as those of the Alamanni, the Burgundians"
15258,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"and the Thuringians, had disappeared within the last half century; in"
15259,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the fourth century they were probably far more numerous. Many of them
15260,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"may have been quite insignificant, like the petty kingdoms which are"
15261,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,said to have existed in Norway--eight apparently in the district of
15262,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Trondhjem alone--down to the time of Harold the Fair-haired. Several
15263,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of the nations which figure prominently in Tacitus' works had perhaps
15264,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,disappeared still earlier. At all events they are never mentioned
15265,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,either in historical works or traditions referring to the Heroic Age.
15266,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15267,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The reverse process cannot be traced so clearly. The division of a
15268,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,kingdom between brothers or other relatives does not seem as a rule to
15269,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,have led to a permanent partition. Very often indeed it was apparently
15270,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,no more than a temporary distribution of estates and spheres of
15271,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"jurisdiction, not necessarily in solid blocks[557]. In such cases the"
15272,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"kingdom was still regarded as one property, of which the kings were"
15273,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,joint possessors. But there can be no question that many kingdoms
15274,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"established on alien soil, e.g. in Britain, were offshoots from other"
15275,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,kingdoms.
15276,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15277,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,This consideration brings us to the much debated question of the
15278,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,relationship between kingdom and nation. It has been assumed by
15279,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,many scholars that among the Teutonic peoples the kingdom was a
15280,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,comparatively late outgrowth from the nation or tribe. In reality
15281,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,this problem seems to me to have much in common with that of the hen
15282,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,and the egg. With the earliest kingdoms of all we are not concerned
15283,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,here; it will be enough to mention that our earliest historical
15284,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"notices testify to the prevalence of kingship, though not always to"
15285,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,monarchy in the strict sense of the term. In the Heroic Age however we
15286,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"certainly find kingdoms springing up where no nation or tribe, properly"
15287,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"speaking, can be said to have existed previously. We may cite the"
15288,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"case of Odoacer, who in 476 made himself king in Italy with the help"
15289,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of his troops. In principle we may regard him as the _princeps_ of a
15290,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,_comitatus_. Then we have to consider the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.
15291,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"The Mercian royal family traced their descent from Offa, the ancient"
15292,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"king of Angel, while the West Saxon dynasty claimed to be sprung from"
15293,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"that Wig, the son of Freawine, who was earl of Slesvig under Offa's"
15294,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"father, according to the story preserved by Saxo. But to the origin of"
15295,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the rest the genealogies give us no clue. If they were all of royal
15296,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,origin--and apparently they did claim divine descent--the Angli must
15297,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,have possessed a numerous royal class; and we are scarcely justified
15298,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,in denying that this may have been the case[558]. On the other hand it
15299,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,is by no means impossible that some of them were sprung from foreign
15300,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"peoples, such as the Danes, Swedes or Warni. But what we may regard as"
15301,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,practically certain is that the individual kingdoms did not rest upon
15302,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,a national or tribal foundation. There is not the slightest ground
15303,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,for supposing that (e.g.) the East Anglians as a people belonged to
15304,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,a different nation or tribe from the Northumbrians. It is scarcely
15305,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,credible that the first kings were anything else than _principes_ in
15306,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"command of _comitatus_, whether they set out from the homeland in this"
15307,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,position or established themselves at a later date by severing their
15308,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,allegiance from other kings in Britain itself.
15309,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15310,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Nor is there any reason for supposing that this phenomenon was peculiar
15311,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to Britain. The story of Waldhere tells of the presence of small
15312,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Teutonic communities in eastern Gaul, each under a royal family"
15313,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of its own. And not only heroic stories but also historical works
15314,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,relating to the earlier part of the Heroic Age frequently refer to
15315,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,comparatively small bands of warriors--such as that led by the Goth
15316,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Sarus in Stilicho's time--in various parts of the Roman empire, and"
15317,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,even beyond its borders[559]. Such bands may very well have produced
15318,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,communities like the one ruled by Waldhere's father[560]; but it would
15319,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,be absurd to speak of them as nations or tribes. They have clearly far
15320,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,more in common with the military kingship established by Odoacer. The
15321,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,peculiarity of his position indeed lies only in the magnitude of the
15322,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,power to which he attained.
15323,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15324,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,In brief we have to distinguish between two classes of kingdoms in the
15325,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Heroic Age. In the new kingdoms, settled on foreign soil, we find an"
15326,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"essentially military kingship, an _imperium_ vested in a particular"
15327,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"family. These kings either established themselves in Roman cities,"
15328,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"such as Ravenna, Langres or York, or moved about from one royal estate"
15329,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to another. Of national assemblies we have frequently no trace at
15330,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"all, while the council is identical with the _comitatus_ and consists"
15331,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of relatives and nominees of the king. Such kingdoms often rest on
15332,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,no national or tribal foundations; the king and his _comitatus_ form
15333,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the nucleus of the organism. On the other hand the older kingdoms,"
15334,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"especially in the North, retained many features of a more primitive"
15335,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"constitution. The king's position had a religious significance, and"
15336,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"his capital, e.g. at Leire or Gamla Upsala, was the chief national"
15337,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"sanctuary, at which assemblies, primarily religious but possessing"
15338,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"considerable political influence, took place from time to time. It is"
15339,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,likely too that the councils here were originally permanent bodies with
15340,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"more or less fixed prerogatives--essentially religious, but yet by no"
15341,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,means without political power. Between these two types of kingdoms we
15342,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"find others of an intermediate character, especially in nations which"
15343,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,had migrated _en masse_; and there can be little doubt that during
15344,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the Heroic Age even the most conservative of the older kingdoms were
15345,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,influenced by the newer type. It is the newer type of course which we
15346,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,must regard as truly characteristic of the Heroic Age.
15347,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15348,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,In post-heroic times again we find a reversion to the national idea
15349,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of a kingdom, though on a much larger scale. In English history this"
15350,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,tendency can be traced from the seventh century onwards. In Bede's
15351,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,works it is clear that such an expression as _Merciorum gens_ (_Myrcna
15352,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,maegþ_) had come to mean something more than the royal family of the
15353,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Mercians with their property and dependents. By the ninth and tenth
15354,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,centuries however this feeling is much more clearly perceptible. We
15355,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"may cite King Alfred's will, where it is clearly recognised that the"
15356,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,kingdom should not be divided up as a family property. But it is not
15357,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,until the time of Aethelred II that the full sense of the king's
15358,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,responsibility to the nation finds expression in definite terms.
15359,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15360,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,*       *       *       *       *
15361,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15362,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The form of government which we find depicted in the Homeric poems
15363,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,seems to be not unlike that which we have discussed above. Here
15364,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,too kingship is universal--apparently also without any recognised
15365,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,constitutional limitations to the royal authority. The murder or
15366,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,expulsion of a prince is not unknown; but such cases are due to strife
15367,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,within the royal family. Any differences which we can detect between
15368,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the authority of Homeric kings and that wielded by early Teutonic
15369,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,rulers may be ascribed partly to the much smaller size of the kingdoms
15370,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"and partly to a social feature noted in the last chapter (p. 363 f.),"
15371,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,namely that in many Greek communities kingly or princely rank seems to
15372,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,have been claimed by a number of different families.
15373,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15374,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The last consideration is especially prominent in the Odyssey[561]. The
15375,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,throne of Ithaca has been in the possession of one family for three
15376,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,generations. Yet in I 394 ff. Telemachos says that there are many kings
15377,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of the Achaeans, both young and old, in the island, and he expects that"
15378,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"one of them will take the sovreignty, now that Odysseus is dead. In"
15379,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Scheria also we hear of twelve sceptre-bearing kings under Alcinoos;
15380,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,but to this case we shall have to return shortly. That a king was not
15381,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,necessarily a person of great magnificence may be inferred also from
15382,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"one of the scenes depicted on Achilles' shield (Il. XVIII 556 ff.),"
15383,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,where we find a king in the harvest-field watching the work of the
15384,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,reapers and feasting on the spot. We are reminded here of the story of
15385,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the Norwegian king Sigurðr Sýr who was summoned from the harvest-field
15386,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"to greet his stepson, St Olaf, and whose state-robes had to be sent to"
15387,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,him there in order to enable him to make a suitable appearance[562].
15388,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15389,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,In this connection it is perhaps worth noting that according to the
15390,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Catalogue of Ships the contingents supplied by several communities were
15391,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,under a number of different princes. Thus the Epeioi have four leaders
15392,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"and the Boeotians five, without counting those from Orchomenos and"
15393,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Aspledon. The troops from Argolis (exclusive of Agamemnon's dominions)
15394,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"are led by three princes, all of whom according to later authorities"
15395,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"were related--two of them, Diomedes and Sthenelos, being sons of"
15396,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Adrastos' daughters, while the third, Euryalos, was his brother's"
15397,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"son[563]. Diomedes is said to be the commander-in-chief, but as"
15398,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Sthenelos is his charioteer the relations between them are evidently of
15399,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,an intimate character. It is not stated whether all these princes were
15400,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"actually reigning kings, or merely leaders selected for the expedition;"
15401,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,but Diomedes and Sthenelos at least have no fathers living.
15402,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15403,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"There is no evidence, so far as I am aware, for any form of election"
15404,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"for kings. In the case of Bellerophon we are told that ""the Lycians"
15405,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"apportioned him a demesne"" (τέμενος τάμον); but it was the king who"
15406,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,granted him half the royal rights. And similarly in all other cases the
15407,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,kingly power seems to have been obtained from some relative by blood
15408,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,or marriage. This renders it more easily intelligible that the plural
15409,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"kingship--if such it was--of which we have spoken above, may be due"
15410,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,ultimately to family arrangements. It is scarcely necessary to suppose
15411,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that in such cases the kingdom was always divided into geographical
15412,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,halves and quarters. As to the relationship between the various kings
15413,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,under such an arrangement--e.g. whether the phrase συμπάντων ἡγεῖτο
15414,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,applied to Diomedes in Il. II 567 means a formal recognition of
15415,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,lordship on the part of his colleagues--we have apparently no precise

15417,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15418,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The religious aspect of kingship is not very prominent in the Homeric
15419,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,poems. When the armies are gathered together to perform a sacrifice
15420,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Agamemnon acts as priest (Il. III 271 ff.) with the cooperation of
15421,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Priam, and Nestor seems to take the chief part in sacrifices at Pylos"
15422,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,(Od. III 444 ff.). There is no reason for supposing that such cases
15423,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,are exceptional; as in the North (cf. p. 367) the king or chief
15424,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,person seems likewise to have acted as priest. We do occasionally
15425,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"hear of priests of sanctuaries, such as Chryseus at the opening of"
15426,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the Iliad; but no mention is made of state-priests or tribal priests.
15427,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,In historical times the case was otherwise. Thus Athens possessed
15428,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,a state-priest known as βασιλεύς. The name of the office itself
15429,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,shows that it was a relic of the kingship which had been gradually
15430,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,stripped of all except its religious duties. Political power here was
15431,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"transferred at first to an official called ὁ ἄρχων, whose origin may"
15432,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,have been similar to that of the Frankish _maior domus_. We may note
15433,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"also that at Sparta, where the institution of kingship was preserved"
15434,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"in a modified form, priestly functions were among the chief duties"
15435,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,preserved by the kings.
15436,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15437,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The poems themselves do not make it clear that the religious aspect
15438,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of kingship amounts to more than priestly position, for such phrases"
15439,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,as θεὸς ὣς τίετο δήμῳ are scarcely free from ambiguity. But later
15440,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,authorities give us much more information in this respect. In the first
15441,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"place we may notice certain legends, such as that of the impious king"
15442,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Salmoneus, who aspired to the functions of Zeus--a story which is now"
15443,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,thought by many scholars to have arisen from a misunderstanding. More
15444,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,than one of the early Attic kings also seem to have been regarded
15445,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,as at least partly divine[564]. But above all we have to take into
15446,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,account the statement of Clement of Alexandria (_Protr._ II 38) that
15447,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the Spartans worshipped a certain Ζεὺς Ἀγαμέμνων, which has led"
15448,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,some writers to assume that Agamemnon was originally a god. In all
15449,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"probability the true explanation is furnished by Tzetzes[565], who"
15450,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,says that in early times kings regularly bore the name Ζεύς. We have
15451,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"an interesting parallel here to the usage of the ancient Swedes[566],"
15452,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,whose kings are said to have been called Yngvi (cf. p. 367). In both
15453,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,cases we may probably infer that the king was regarded in some sense
15454,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,as the god's representative; possibly he personated him on certain
15455,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,occasions. Yet it must be remembered that this aspect of kingship is
15456,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,not brought forward in the poems[567]. If our sketch of the history of
15457,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Homeric poetry is correct in its main outlines, we must conclude that"
15458,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the divinity of kings was not a doctrine to which supreme importance
15459,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,was attached in the courts themselves.
15460,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15461,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,National or tribal assemblies are not often mentioned. In Od. VIII
15462,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,26 ff. Alcinoos addresses the Phaeacians in their assembly (ἀγορή)
15463,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"and declares to them his resolve to assist Odysseus. Again, in II 6"
15464,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,ff. Telemachos calls an assembly in Ithaca. But on this occasion the
15465,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"first speaker, Aigyptios, says that the assembly has not met since"
15466,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the departure of Odysseus, some twenty years before, and further that"
15467,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,he wonders who it is who has called them together now. The former
15468,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"statement seems to indicate that such meetings were not held regularly,"
15469,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,while the latter at first sight suggests that it was open to anyone
15470,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"to call them, and consequently that they were of a quite informal"
15471,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,character--in spite of certain rules of procedure which seem to have
15472,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,been usually followed. But the conditions here are abnormal. The king
15473,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,has disappeared and no one has yet taken his place; Aigyptios is
15474,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,perhaps scarcely prepared to expect that the young Telemachos would
15475,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,summon the assembly. It is true that in Il. I 54 ff. the Achaeans
15476,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"are called together by Achilles, not Agamemnon; but here we have to"
15477,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"deal with a confederate army in the field[568], and with a prince who"
15478,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,shortly afterwards sets Agamemnon's authority at open defiance. There
15479,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,is scarcely sufficient ground for supposing that a similar course would
15480,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"have been possible at home, when the king was on the spot. Further, it"
15481,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,is to be noted that on all the above occasions the notice served is
15482,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,so short that only those in the immediate neighbourhood could attend.
15483,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,On the whole then we are probably justified in doubting whether any
15484,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"definite rules existed as to when the assembly should be called, and"
15485,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,indeed whether this body had much in common with the constitutionally
15486,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,regulated assemblies of historical times[569]. It seems rather to be
15487,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,a more or less fortuitous gathering called together on the spot by
15488,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,criers when the king wishes to bring something before the notice of the
15489,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,public[570].
15490,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15491,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,In Od. III 5 ff. we certainly do hear of a great public
15492,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,gathering--indeed we may probably say a national gathering--of a kind
15493,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,which can only have taken place at definitely fixed times. But it
15494,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,is clear that this was essentially a religious festival[571]. Such
15495,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"gatherings may of course have been used for political purposes, as in"
15496,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the North; but we have no information on this subject.
15497,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15498,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The Achaean 'council of elders' (βουλὴ γερόντων) in the Iliad seems to
15499,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,be a body of quite as informal character as the assembly. On several
15500,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"occasions Agamemnon calls together a small number of princes, namely"
15501,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Nestor, Idomeneus, the two Aiantes, Diomedes and Odysseus, together"
15502,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,with his brother Menelaos. This number of course forms only a small
15503,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,proportion of the leading men in the army. Occasionally however we find
15504,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"others summoned, such as Meges and even Thrasymedes and Meriones, who"
15505,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,are not the chiefs of contingents. The council of an expeditionary army
15506,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,however is an exceptional case. On the Trojan side we hear of a number
15507,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of δημογέροντες with Priam (Il. III 146 ff.), seven of whom are named."
15508,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Three of them are brothers of the king, while others are fathers of"
15509,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the most distinguished Trojan warriors. They are described as eloquent
15510,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"orators, but no account is given of their deliberations. In the Odyssey"
15511,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,references to councils are very rare. No mention is made of such a body
15512,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,in Ithaca. In Scheria however Alcinoos has twelve kings under him (VII
15513,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"390 f.), who clearly form his council and are to be identified with the"
15514,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,'leaders and rulers of the Phaeacians' Φαιήκων ἡγήτορες ἠδὲ μέδοντες
15515,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"who feasted in his hall (VII 98 f., 186; VIII 26, 41, 46 f.), though on"
15516,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Odysseus' arrival they were apparently not all present (VII 189). It
15517,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,may be observed that in the account of the Phaeacian assembly Alcinoos
15518,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,uses the same formula as when he is addressing the princes in his hall:
15519,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"""Hearken, ye leaders and rulers of the Phaeacians."" His speech then"
15520,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,is directed primarily to the princes--a fact which seems to indicate
15521,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that council and assembly were not very clearly distinguished. In this
15522,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"connection we may note that in the assemblies of the Iliad, as in those"
15523,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of the ancient Germans, the speaking is almost invariably left to the"
15524,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,princes.
15525,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15526,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,So far as the councils of the Iliad are concerned little can be said
15527,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,against the view that Agamemnon calls together from time to time those
15528,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of the leaders in whom he has most confidence. The same may be true of
15529,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Alcinoos' council[572]. But on the whole it seems more probable that
15530,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"this is a permanent institution, with definitely fixed numbers and"
15531,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"privileges. The 'sceptre-bearing' under-kings are twelve in number,"
15532,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,like the councils of so many European peoples in ancient times. The
15533,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"agora where they meet, with its polished stones, is clearly a place"
15534,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,specially constructed for such functions and similar apparently to
15535,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the one described in the trial scene depicted on Achilles' shield (Il.
15536,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"XVIII 497 ff.), where the elders are seated on polished stones 'in a"
15537,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,sacred circle.' We are reminded here of the Northern council of the
15538,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"gods--especially as described in Gautreks Saga, cap. 7[573]--and of the"
15539,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"'circle of judgement' (_domhringr_), which we find at 'chief-places'"
15540,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,(i.e. centres of jurisdiction) in Iceland. Possibly too we should refer
15541,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to the stones used in the election of Scandinavian kings (cf. p. 368).
15542,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,If we take the evidence as a whole it can hardly be denied that the
15543,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Phaeacian council does seem to show the characteristics of a primitive
15544,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,communal organisation[574]. But it would be unwise to assume that
15545,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,councils of this type were universal in the Heroic Age.
15546,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15547,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"The actual power possessed by the council, whatever its constitution,"
15548,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,does not seem to amount to much. Agamemnon is often ready to take
15549,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"advice from some of his colleagues, especially Nestor; and in Od."
15550,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,VII 167 ff. Alcinoos acts on the suggestion of the old Echeneos.
15551,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Both these cases may be compared with the story of Genseric (cf. p.
15552,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,369 f.[575]). But it is clearly as individuals that the councillors
15553,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,have influence. In the Iliad Achilles acts on his own initiative and
15554,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,withdraws from the war in open defiance of Agamemnon. But even in the
15555,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,case of home councils--I mean councils of the kingdoms--we never hear
15556,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of organised action. In Ithaca, where the king is away, no council"
15557,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,seems to exist. Nor is any mention made of a council in the story
15558,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of Agamemnon's death and Orestes' vengeance. This fact deserves to
15559,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,be remarked all the more because we find apparently just the same
15560,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"phenomenon in Anglo-Saxon poetry, e.g. in Beowulf where the proceedings"
15561,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,after Hygelac's death are related. The natural inference to be drawn
15562,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,from the evidence is that the councillors were essentially advisers to
15563,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the king and that after his death or disappearance their standing was
15564,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,gone. But here again caution is necessary. It is difficult to believe
15565,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that such a description can be true of a council like that of the
15566,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Phaeacians, however ready they may seem to follow the king in ordinary"
15567,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,circumstances.
15568,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15569,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The cases of emergency arising out of the misfortunes of Odysseus
15570,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"and Agamemnon bring to our attention another curious feature, again"
15571,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"possibly analogous to the conditions described in Beowulf, namely"
15572,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that the king does not seem to appoint a regent in his absence[576].
15573,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Odysseus has entrusted his household to Mentor (Od. II 226 f.), and"
15574,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Agamemnon has put his wife in charge of a minstrel (_ib._ III 267 f.);
15575,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,but nothing is said of the kingdom in either case. Are we to suppose
15576,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"that the queen is the person in authority? Presumably, like Hygd, she"
15577,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,has command over the treasury; for (as also perhaps in the North) the
15578,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,treasury seems to be connected with the queen's chamber. If it be
15579,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,objected that the absence of any national control apart from the king's
15580,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"(or queen's) personal authority must have been productive of strife, we"
15581,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"have only to refer to the stories to see that dissensions, especially"
15582,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"between members of the same family, were by no means of rare occurrence."
15583,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15584,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,With regard to international relations warfare between different
15585,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,kingdoms does not seem to be particularly common. Apart from the siege
15586,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of Troy we hear incidentally of a number of struggles, such as the"
15587,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"two expeditions against Thebes, the war of the Aetolians against the"
15588,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Curetes, and those of the Arcadians and the Epeioi against Pylos, while"
15589,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,references to buccaneering exploits are frequent. But on the whole the
15590,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,normal state of relations between the various kingdoms is one of peace.
15591,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15592,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"As in the Teutonic Heroic Age, we hear frequently of marriages between"
15593,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,different royal families. Agamemnon's offer of one of his daughters to
15594,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Achilles is part of his attempt at reconciliation and may be compared
15595,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,with the marriage of Ingeld and Freawaru. Menelaos marries his daughter
15596,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to Achilles' son. Both these cases show that such marriages were not
15597,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,limited to neighbouring families. So also Penelope the daughter of
15598,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Icarios (whose home is not stated in the poems) has married the king of
15599,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Ithaca, while her sister is the wife of Eumelos at Pherai in Thessaly"
15600,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,(Od. IV 795 ff.). Such marriages would doubtless do much towards
15601,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,promoting friendly relations between the various royal families.
15602,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Indeed visits paid by one prince to another seem to be nothing very
15603,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"unusual[577]. Autolycos visits his son-in-law Laertes in Ithaca,"
15604,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,and Odysseus later goes to stay with Autolycos in the neighbourhood
15605,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of Parnassos. Helen recognises several of the Achaean princes from
15606,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the walls of Troy and remarks (Il. III 232 f.) that Idomeneus had
15607,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,frequently been entertained by Menelaos in her old home.
15608,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15609,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Again, it can scarcely be doubted that the expedition against Troy"
15610,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,involves the existence of relations of some kind between Agamemnon and
15611,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the other kings. But the character of Agamemnon's position in Greece
15612,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,itself is never clearly defined in the poems. According to Od. XXIV 115
15613,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,ff. he has considerable difficulty in persuading Odysseus to take part
15614,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,in the expedition. On the other hand in Il. XIII 669 we hear of a fine
15615,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,(θωή) for those who refused to serve[578]. This passage however refers
15616,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"to a native of Corinth, who was doubtless a much nearer neighbour."
15617,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Indeed the Catalogue of Ships (Il. II 569 ff.) represents the
15618,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Corinthian contingent as under Agamemnon's immediate command. According
15619,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to this section of the poem Agamemnon's own territories consist of
15620,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the north-western part of Argolis, together with at least the eastern"
15621,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"half of Achaia, while the rest of Argolis belongs to Diomedes and his"
15622,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,colleagues. But in IX 149 ff. (291 ff.) it is clear that Agamemnon
15623,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"possesses part of Messenia, bordering apparently on Pylos (the"
15624,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"territory of Nestor). Further, we have to take into account that, apart"
15625,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"from the Catalogue, neither poem gives evidence for the existence of"
15626,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"anything which can fairly be called a kingdom in the Peloponnesos,"
15627,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"except Pylos, Elis and the territories of the two brothers[579]. Taking"
15628,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the positive and negative evidence together it seems probable that
15629,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Agamemnon and his brother were regarded as ruling over the greater
15630,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"part of the peninsula, though certain cities and districts remained in"
15631,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"possession of native princes, perhaps in a dependent position. Again,"
15632,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,I am not aware that there is any evidence apart from the Catalogue
15633,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,for supposing that the territories of the two brothers were regarded
15634,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"as definitely marked off from one another. From Il. IX 149 ff., taken"
15635,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"together with the references to Sparta and Mycenae, we may infer the"
15636,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,contrary. On the whole it seems more probable that we have here to do
15637,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"with a case of divided kingship, as so frequently among the Teutonic"
15638,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"peoples, rather than with two separate kingdoms. In that case too we"
15639,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,shall obtain a satisfactory explanation of the later tradition (cf. p.
15640,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,240) which claimed Agamemnon for Sparta or Amyclai.
15641,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15642,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Beyond his own territories Agamemnon's authority does not seem
15643,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to be represented as anything more than a somewhat indefinite
15644,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,hegemony--comparable probably with the relationship of Theodric the
15645,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Ostrogoth to his northern allies (cf. p. 373 f.). The army which he
15646,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,leads against Troy is furnished partly by his own subjects and partly
15647,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,by a number of princes whose positions may have varied from complete
15648,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,dependence to something which may best be described as alliance. A
15649,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,good parallel is to be found in the army led by the Mercian king Penda
15650,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"against Oswio, which according to Bede (_H. E._ III 24) consisted of"
15651,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,thirty _legiones_ under _regii duces_. Among these were the king of
15652,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,East Anglia and several Welsh kings.
15653,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15654,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,How Agamemnon acquired his imperial position we are not told; for
15655,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,scarcely anything is recorded of his doings before the Trojan war.
15656,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,From Il. II 104 ff. we may perhaps infer that his family had held a
15657,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"preeminent position before him[580], although Pelops was located by"
15658,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,later tradition in a different part of the peninsula[581]. Nor again
15659,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,is it made clear whether the hegemony remained with the family after
15660,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Agamemnon's death. All that can be said is that the Odyssey represents
15661,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Menelaos as a very wealthy king and that neither the poems nor later
15662,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,tradition give any hint of the rise of a new power in the Peloponnesos
15663,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,before the 'Return of the Heracleidai.' What may be regarded as certain
15664,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"is that no individual Greek prince attained to such a supremacy again,"
15665,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,for many centuries after the close of the Heroic Age.
15666,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15667,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,In conclusion we must consider briefly the question how far the Homeric
15668,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,kingdoms rested upon a national or tribal basis (cf. p. 375 ff.). Upon
15669,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,this question the nomenclature of the poems seems to throw some light.
15670,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"In the north of Greece, except the plain of Thessaly, the inhabitants"
15671,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of the various kingdoms bear what are apparently national or tribal
15672,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"names, e.g. Βοιωτοί, Λοκροί, Δόλοπες, Ἐνιῆνες, Μάγνητες, Αἰτωλοί,"
15673,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Ἄβαντες--probably also Φωκῆες and Μυρμιδόνες (Ἕλληνες). The same is
15674,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"true of kingdoms outside Greece, e.g. Φαίηκες, Τρῶες and the various"
15675,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Trojan allies. But in the Peloponnesos the only names of this type are
15676,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Ἐπειοί, Ἀρκάδες and Καύκωνες; for Πύλιοι and Ἀργεῖοι are not primary"
15677,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"national names but derivatives of Πύλος and Ἄργος, while Ἀχαιοί is"
15678,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"a name, like _Engle_, applied to the inhabitants of many kingdoms."
15679,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"This evidence, so far as it goes, tends to indicate that the southern"
15680,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,kingdoms rested on a political or military rather than a tribal
15681,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,basis--which is natural enough if we are right in believing that the
15682,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Peloponnesian Achaeans were an offshoot from the Achaeans of northern
15683,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Greece. It would seem then that these kingdoms are to be compared with
15684,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the newer kingdoms of the Teutonic Heroic Age, the nucleus of which"
15685,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,consisted of the kings with their military followings; and I am not
15686,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,aware of the existence of any evidence inconsistent with this view. I
15687,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,do not mean of course that these kingdoms were necessarily areas carved
15688,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"out by the sword, like the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. What I mean is that"
15689,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,we have no reason for supposing that Agamemnon's subjects believed
15690,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,themselves to be of a different nationality from Nestor's subjects or
15691,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the rest of the Achaeans and that each of these kingdoms had a separate
15692,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,tribal organisation and tradition of its own.
15693,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15694,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,If our observation is correct it is important to notice that several
15695,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of the chief Achaean leaders belong to kingdoms which apparently
15696,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,rest on a non-national basis. Among them we have to include not only
15697,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Agamemnon, Menelaos and Nestor, but also probably Idomeneus; for the"
15698,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,name Κρῆτες in the Homeric poems can scarcely mean anything else than
15699,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"inhabitants of Crete. The followers of Diomedes and of Aias, the son"
15700,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of Telamon, likewise appear to bear no national names. The case of"
15701,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Odysseus is doubtful, since his subjects are described both as Ἀχαιοί"
15702,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,and Κεφαλλῆνες. The question is whether he is king of the Cephallenes
15703,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"in general or only king of Ithaca, with a temporary lordship over the"
15704,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,rest of the nation. The only 'heroes of the first rank' who clearly
15705,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,represent national kingdoms are Achilles and Aias the son of Oileus.

15709,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,In the course of this chapter we have noticed many remarkable
15710,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,resemblances between the Homeric and the early Teutonic systems of
15711,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,government. Not all of these however can be regarded as characteristic
15712,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of the Heroic Age; some have been inherited in all probability
15713,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,from an earlier stage of development. Such are the religious type
15714,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of kingship, the council of twelve and the national gathering for"
15715,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,religious (sacrificial) purposes[582]. The form of government
15716,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,truly characteristic of the Heroic Age in both areas alike is an
15717,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"irresponsible type of kingship, resting not upon tribal or national"
15718,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,law--which is of little account--but upon military prestige. Such
15719,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,kingdoms are often of recent origin and without roots in any national
15720,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"organisation. The assembly here, so far as it exists at all, is a"
15721,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"gathering summoned at the king's pleasure, while the council consists"
15722,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of an indefinite number of his trusted followers, whose advice he may"
15723,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"wish to have from time to time. Lastly, we may observe in both cases"
15724,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,a very strong tendency to develop intercourse between one kingdom and
15725,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,another--partly by royal marriages and partly by the cultivation of
15726,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"personal relations between the kings, which generally take the form of"
15727,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"a recognition of overlordship, though in varying degree. The general"
15728,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,effect of this intercourse must have been to produce something in the
15729,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"nature of an international royal caste, and to break down tribal and"
15730,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"local prejudices, at least in the highest ranks of society."
15731,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
15732,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,With the end of the Heroic Age the lines followed by Teutonic and
15733,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Greek political history part company. In both cases, it is true, we"
15734,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,find a revival of national feeling. Among the Teutonic peoples however
15735,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the kingdoms constantly tend to decrease in number and increase in
15736,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,size--partly by the process sketched above (p. 375) and partly by
15737,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,pressure from without. In Greece on the other hand this tendency was
15738,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"brought to an abrupt end[583] by the Thessalian and Dorian conquests,"
15739,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,by which the richest parts of the country were brought into the power
15740,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of populations in a lower stage of civilisation and governed largely
15741,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,by tribal principles and prejudices. The general effect of these
15742,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,movements was to isolate the various communities--not only in the
15743,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"conquered provinces but also in those districts, such as Attica, which"
15744,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,remained entirely or comparatively untouched. This isolation in turn
15745,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,was probably favourable to the growth of internal dissensions. In the
15746,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,end at all events no king succeeded in maintaining a personal lordship
15747,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"over the rest of his class[584], even within the smallest communities."
15748,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The title came to denote an official with constantly diminishing
15749,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"powers, often indeed of an exclusively religious character, while the"
15750,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,allegiance formerly owed to an individual was now transferred to the
15751,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"state and its constitution[585]. At a later date, it is true, most of"
15752,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the Greek states again came for a time into the power of individual
15753,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"rulers. But it is not until the days of Philip II, king of the"
15754,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Macedonians, that we find any single man holding an authority over the"
15755,GOVERNMENT IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Greek world such as the poems attribute to Agamemnon.

15842,FOOTNOTES:,England down to the end of the seventh century and in the North much
15843,FOOTNOTES:,later--the title of king was applied to sons and other relatives of
15844,FOOTNOTES:,"kings, as well as to dependent princes. The only qualifications for"
15845,FOOTNOTES:,"the title were (i) royal birth, (ii) the possession of some kind of"
15846,FOOTNOTES:,authority or 'lordship' (τιμή). How small this authority might be can
15847,FOOTNOTES:,"be seen from St Olaf's Saga (Heimskr.), cap. 4, where we are told that"
15848,FOOTNOTES:,"Olaf had the title of king given to him by his followers; ""for it was"

15877,FOOTNOTES:,[566] The parallel must not be pressed too far of course. According to

15882,FOOTNOTES:,to the Homeric epithet διοτρεφής (possibly also διογενής) which is

15884,FOOTNOTES:,"but not the chief of the gods, though he is sometimes in poetry called"
15885,FOOTNOTES:,"_folkvaldi goða_, which Saxo translates by _satrapa deorum_."
15886,FOOTNOTES:,
15887,FOOTNOTES:,[567] A trace of the belief that kings had power over the seasons (cf.

15889,FOOTNOTES:,
15890,FOOTNOTES:,[568] I cannot help thinking that evidence derived from the Achaean
15891,FOOTNOTES:,gatherings in the Iliad is somewhat precarious ground on which to build
15892,FOOTNOTES:,up a theory regarding the constitutional rights possessed by the ἀγορή
15893,FOOTNOTES:,"at home. The same remark applies to such a passage as Od. XII 297,"
15894,FOOTNOTES:,"where an important constitutional change (cf. Fanta, _op. cit._, p. 91)"
15895,FOOTNOTES:,has been inferred from the mutinous behaviour of a ship's crew.
15896,FOOTNOTES:,
15897,FOOTNOTES:,[569] It cannot fairly be argued from Od. II 192 f. that the assembly

15899,FOOTNOTES:,are relying not upon any 'constitutional' rights but on force majeure.

15906,FOOTNOTES:,is very far from convincing. We may refer to such passages as Od. XII

15932,FOOTNOTES:,assuming this to be the case. The features noted here are such as we

15988,FOOTNOTES:,[581] Thucydides (I 9) relates how Atreus acquired the sovereignty

16004,FOOTNOTES:,[583] It is important to notice that the tendency appears to have been
16005,FOOTNOTES:,by no means so far developed as in the Teutonic Heroic Age. We cannot
16006,FOOTNOTES:,"tell, it is true, how far the various dependent cities and districts"
16007,FOOTNOTES:,remained in the hands of native royal families and how far they were
16008,FOOTNOTES:,governed by officials. In the latter category we may include such a
16009,FOOTNOTES:,person as Phoinix (Il. IX 483 f.). But it is clear that the royal

16024,FOOTNOTES:,of short duration. Earlier cases may be found among the Cherusci and
16025,FOOTNOTES:,other peoples of western Germany during the first century--where it is
16026,FOOTNOTES:,to be noted that Tacitus' _principes_ and _regnum_ correspond to Bede's
16027,FOOTNOTES:,_subreguli_ and _imperium_ respectively. I cannot help thinking that

16051,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16052,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16053,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,In the course of the Heroic Age many of the Teutonic peoples were
16054,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,converted to Christianity. The change of faith began among the Goths
16055,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,soon after the middle of the fourth century and must have spread
16056,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,very quickly to the Vandals. The Gepidae and Langobardi seem to
16057,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,have followed the example of these peoples in the course of the
16058,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,following century. At the time of Justinian's accession the Heruli
16059,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,were probably the only Teutonic people in eastern central Europe who
16060,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,remained heathen. In the west the Burgundians accepted Christianity
16061,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"apparently about the beginning of the fifth century, and the Franks"
16062,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,before its close. The conversion of England took place in the seventh
16063,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,century; that of the Frisians and Old Saxons for the most part in the
16064,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,eighth. The Northern Kingdoms in general were little affected by the
16065,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"change until towards the close of the tenth century, though the first"
16066,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,missionary efforts in Denmark and Sweden began before the middle of the
16067,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,ninth. In parts of Sweden the heathen religion lingered on until late
16068,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,in the eleventh century.
16069,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16070,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"In the Nibelungenlied it is clearly recognised, perhaps through"
16071,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"scholastic influence, that the multitude assembled at Attila's court"
16072,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,included both Christians and heathens; but no such distinction is
16073,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,drawn in the English and Norse poems. In the former all the characters
16074,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"are made to speak as Christians, though they observe heathen rites;"
16075,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,in the latter no indication is given that any of the characters were
16076,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Christians. In point of fact there can be little doubt that most of
16077,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the persons who figure in the heroic stories were heathens. In all
16078,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"probability such was the case with the earlier Goths, Eormenric"
16079,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"and his contemporaries, as well as with all the characters of the"
16080,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Danish cycles. On the other hand the later Goths, Theodric and his"
16081,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"contemporaries, were certainly Christians, and so also were the"
16082,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Burgundians, Guthhere and his brothers, as well as Alboin, king of the"
16083,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Langobardi.
16084,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16085,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"With the Christian religion we are not concerned here; for, greatly"
16086,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"as it influenced the Teutonic peoples, it was in no sense native. It"
16087,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,is to the religion which Christianity displaced that we must give our
16088,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,attention. Unfortunately however the records which have come down to us
16089,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"from the Heroic Age itself are entirely of foreign authorship, and on"
16090,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the whole they give us extremely little information on this subject. We
16091,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,are bound therefore to base our account of Teutonic religion upon the
16092,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"comparatively abundant evidence preserved in Scandinavian literature,"
16093,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,though we must not assume that the religion of the Heroic Age possessed
16094,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the characteristics which we find in the North some five centuries
16095,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,later. When we have given a brief summary of the chief features of
16096,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,this later religion we shall have to discuss in somewhat more detail
16097,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the small amount of information available for the earlier period. This
16098,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,is rendered all the more necessary by the fact that in works dealing
16099,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,with the subject the religion of the Heroic Age has not generally been
16100,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,distinguished from that of the Germans of Tacitus' time.
16101,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16102,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Now the feature which will probably strike any one most forcibly from
16103,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,a careful study of Northern religion is an extraordinary discrepancy
16104,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,between the mythical stories contained in the Edda and elsewhere on
16105,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the one hand and references to actual religious observances on the
16106,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,other. In the former we find the gods grouped together in an organised
16107,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"community, of which Othin is the recognised head. Frigg is his wife,"
16108,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Thor and many of the other gods his sons. Most of the mythical stories
16109,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"deal with Othin's exploits and adventures, and serve to illustrate his"
16110,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,power and wisdom. On the other hand the references to religious rites
16111,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"point in quite a different direction. In Iceland, for which our records"
16112,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"are most full, there is practically no evidence for the worship of"
16113,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Othin. Thor is by far the most prominent figure, and after him Frey;"
16114,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,occasionally also we hear of Niörðr[586]. References to the worship
16115,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of other supernatural beings, elves and landvættir (_genii locorum_),"
16116,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,are not unfrequent. In notices referring to Norway the evidence is
16117,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,not very different. We do indeed sometimes hear of worship paid to
16118,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Othin, especially in legendary stories, relating to early times; but in"
16119,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,references to what may be called the historical period--the tenth and
16120,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,eleventh centuries--Thor and Frey are distinctly more prominent.
16121,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16122,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Two explanations have been given of this curious phenomenon. One is
16123,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that the cult of Othin was introduced into the North at a comparatively
16124,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,late period and that it had not yet obtained a real hold at the time
16125,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,when Iceland was settled. This explanation has no foundation in
16126,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,tradition. Indeed the evidence of the stories points to an entirely
16127,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,opposite conclusion. Moreover it is worth noting that according to
16128,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Procopius (_Goth._ II 15) the inhabitants of 'Thule' (i.e. Scandinavia)
16129,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,worshipped 'Ares' more than any other god. Since Othin is essentially a
16130,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"god of war it is natural to suppose that he is the deity meant, rather"
16131,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,than the somewhat obscure Týr.
16132,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16133,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The other explanation is that the cults of Othin and Thor belonged
16134,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"to two different classes of the community, the former to princely"
16135,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"families and their retinues, the latter to the country people, more"
16136,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,especially the (non-official) landowners. This explanation seems to be
16137,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,in complete accordance with the facts. There is no evidence for the
16138,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,worship of Othin either in early or late times except by princes or
16139,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"persons attached to their courts, while there are very few instances"
16140,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of the worship of Thor by such persons. Further we may note that while
16141,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"names compounded with _Thór-_ (e.g. _Thórkell_, _Thórolfr_) are about"
16142,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the commonest type of all among the ordinary free population, both in"
16143,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Norway and Iceland--and such names are significant since they denote
16144,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that the persons who bore them were dedicated to the god--they are
16145,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,practically unknown in royal families. It will be convenient now to
16146,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,give a short sketch of the two deities and their cults.
16147,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16148,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Thor is represented as a middle-aged man of immense bodily strength.
16149,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,He is well disposed towards the human race and looked upon as their
16150,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"protector against harmful demons, to whom he is an implacable foe. In"
16151,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the poems Thrymskviða and Hýmiskviða and in a number of prose stories
16152,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"we have descriptions of Thor's adventures with giants, in which he is"
16153,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,generally represented as breaking their skulls with his hammer. He uses
16154,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"no weapon except the hammer, and when he travels he either walks or"
16155,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,drives in a car drawn by goats. When he comes to the assembly of the
16156,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,gods he is said to wade through certain rivers on the way. His escort
16157,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,never consists of more than three persons; very often he goes alone.
16158,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The picture which the stories give us is clearly that of an idealised
16159,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Norwegian countryman of primitive times. There are scarcely any traces
16160,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of his original connection with the thunder, though in Sweden it was"
16161,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,clearly remembered.
16162,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16163,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The portraiture of Othin offers the greatest possible contrast to that
16164,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of Thor. He is represented as an old man, generally with one eye, and"
16165,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,he gains his ends not by bravery or physical strength but by wisdom and
16166,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"cunning. Sometimes we find him coming, usually in disguise, to giants"
16167,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"or witches, in order to gain from them some magical power or knowledge"
16168,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of the future; sometimes he imparts his knowledge, again generally"
16169,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"magical, to men. He presents his favourites with weapons and instructs"
16170,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,them in the art of war. Above all he is the god who gives victory in
16171,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,battle.
16172,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16173,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Othin's chief dwelling is called Valhöll (the 'hall of the slain'),"
16174,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,and all persons who fall in battle were believed to go to him there.
16175,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Hence we find such expressions as 'to go to lodge with Othin' or 'to
16176,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,go to Valhalla' used as euphemisms for 'to be killed.' Before joining
16177,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,battle it is said to have been customary to throw a javelin over the
16178,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,enemy with the words 'Othin has you all.' After a battle prisoners
16179,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"were commonly sacrificed to Othin, and on such occasions, and indeed"
16180,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"at all human sacrifices, the formula regularly used was: 'I give thee"
16181,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to Othin.' The usual method of sacrifice was by hanging or stabbing
16182,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,or a combination of both. With this practice we may probably connect
16183,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"a somewhat obscure myth recorded in Hávamál, str. 138, according to"
16184,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"which Othin was sacrificed to himself, by hanging and stabbing, on the"
16185,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,world-tree. Certainly it is to be noted that the sacrifices to Othin
16186,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,seem to have been invariably human. They were clearly rites of quite a
16187,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,different character from the sacrificial feasts frequently mentioned
16188,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"in the sagas, where the victims consisted of horses, oxen and other"
16189,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"edible animals, part of which was offered to the gods, while the rest"
16190,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,was consumed by the worshippers. We do sometimes hear of horses being
16191,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"sacrificed with men, but on such occasions dogs and hawks are also"
16192,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"mentioned, and there is no evidence that any of the victims were eaten."
16193,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,There are very few records of human sacrifices to any god except Othin.
16194,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16195,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The picture of Valhalla presented to us in the poems is a glorified
16196,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,copy of a military king's court[587]. The vast number of slain warriors
16197,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,assembled there in Othin's service spend their days in single combats
16198,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,and their evenings in feasting. Beside them we find the Valkyriur
16199,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"('choosers of the slain'), Othin's adopted daughters, who distribute"
16200,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,ale to the feasters. These also are sent out by Othin to decide the
16201,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,issue of battles and to select warriors for Valhalla. It is noteworthy
16202,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that the term _Valkyriur_ seems to be applied both to supernatural
16203,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,beings--what may perhaps be called minor divinities--and also to living
16204,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"women endowed with supernatural powers, such as that of flying. Thus"
16205,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"both Brynhildr and Sigrún, the wife of Helgi Hundingsbani, are called"
16206,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Valkyries; and it was for deciding a fight contrary to Othin's command
16207,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that the former was punished with perpetual sleep.
16208,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16209,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"In Ynglinga Saga, cap. 8, Othin is said to have ordained ""that all dead"
16210,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,men should be burnt and brought on to the pyre with their property.
16211,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,He said that every dead man should come to Valhöll with such property
16212,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,as he had on the pyre.... But the ashes were to be cast out into the
16213,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"sea or buried down in the earth."" Valhalla seems to be represented"
16214,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,as a spirit world somewhat far away and not connected at all with
16215,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the burial place. This observation brings us to another remarkable
16216,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,discrepancy between the traditions and the customs which we find
16217,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,actually prevailing in the North. We know both from descriptions in
16218,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the sagas and from discoveries made in modern times that in the last
16219,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,few centuries before the adoption of Christianity it was customary
16220,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to bury the dead in their ships or in elaborately constructed wooden
16221,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,chambers--the whole being covered with a barrow of considerable size.
16222,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,In the Prologue to Snorri's Heimskringla this custom is said to be
16223,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of later date than the one attributed to Othin; first was the age of
16224,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"burning, then the age of barrows. Now there is evidence both from"
16225,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the discoveries and from the sagas themselves that the barrows were
16226,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,regarded as sacred and that the spirits of the dead were believed
16227,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to dwell either within them or in the immediate neighbourhood. Not
16228,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,unfrequently we hear of persons coming to a barrow to consult the
16229,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"spirit. Sometimes the ghost, embodied in the corpse, even defends"
16230,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,his property against grave-robbers. The activities of the dead are
16231,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,often represented as injurious; but this is by no means always the
16232,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,case. On one occasion we hear of a dispute between several different
16233,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,districts for the possession of the body of a king whose reign had been
16234,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,distinguished by great prosperity.
16235,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16236,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,On the whole then it is clear that the cult of the dead was practised
16237,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,in the North very much as in most other parts of the world. Yet modern
16238,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,discoveries have brought to light abundant evidence for cremation in
16239,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the early iron age--sometimes in spots which are marked by no external
16240,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,monument--so that the statements of Ynglinga Saga may be regarded
16241,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,as based on good tradition. We are driven to conclude therefore
16242,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"that in their conception of immortality, as in their theology, the"
16243,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"inhabitants of the North held two wholly inconsistent views--or,"
16244,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"perhaps it would be more correct to say, two entirely opposite views"
16245,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,as to the desirability of retaining the souls of the dead. In Iceland
16246,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the practice of cremation seems to have been extremely rare, but when"
16247,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,it was resorted to the object is said to have been to get rid of a
16248,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,troublesome ghost. The one view of immortality was by no means so
16249,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,closely bound up with the cult of Thor as the other was with that of
16250,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Othin. But it certainly prevailed among Thor's worshippers.
16251,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16252,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The next most important deity after Othin and Thor was Frey. His cult
16253,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,was widely spread in Norway and Iceland; yet according to tradition
16254,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,its true home was Sweden[588]. The Swedish royal family and nobility
16255,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"traced their descent from Frey, and Upsala, their capital and the chief"
16256,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"sanctuary of the North, was believed to have been founded by him. In"
16257,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Ynglinga Saga, cap. 12 f., we have an account of him which is worth"
16258,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,quoting as an illustration of Northern manes-worship. Frey is here
16259,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,represented as a prince whose reign was characterised by unparalleled
16260,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,prosperity. His death was concealed for three years. But when it became
16261,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"known, the Swedes would not burn him; for they believed that prosperity"
16262,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,and peace would last as long as Frey was in Sweden. They made a great
16263,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,barrow for him therefore and poured into it the tribute which they had
16264,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,been wont to pay him; and they worshipped him for prosperity and peace
16265,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,ever afterwards. A very similar account is given of the Danish king
16266,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Fróði the Peaceful--from which we may infer that in Frey we have to
16267,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,deal not with a deified man but with a mythical character--a 'king of
16268,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the golden age.' His name originally seems to have meant 'prince' or
16269,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"'lord' (Ang.-Sax. _frea_, cf. ἄναξ); very probably it was at one time a"
16270,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,title of the Swedish kings[589].
16271,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16272,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Frey appears to be regarded as a youthful god. The blessings for which
16273,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"he was worshipped were peace and fertility, both of the crops and"
16274,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"livestock, as well as of the human race. His power of controlling the"
16275,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,weather may be accounted for by his association with the Swedish kings
16276,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,(cf. p. 367); but it is clear that his character contains elements
16277,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"drawn from more than one source. His father Niörðr, who is sometimes"
16278,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"associated with him, possesses much the same characteristics, though"
16279,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,he appears to be more particularly connected with the sea. There can
16280,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,be little doubt however that both he and his son have inherited the
16281,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,attributes of an ancient earth-goddess. Although there has been a
16282,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"change of sex, Niörðr's name is identical with that of Nerthus (_id"
16283,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"est Terra Mater_), a deity who according to Tacitus, _Germ._ 40, was"
16284,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,worshipped on 'an island in the ocean'--in all probability Sjælland.
16285,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Niörðr also has a daughter called Freyia (i.e. ἄνασσα, Δέσποινα), who"
16286,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,is represented as a female counterpart of Frey. It is worth noting
16287,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that she is sometimes associated with the next world. According to
16288,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Grímnismál, str. 14, she shares the slain equally with Othin."
16289,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16290,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The deities with which we have just been dealing were collectively
16291,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,known as Vanir. They were held to be of a quite different stock from
16292,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the Aesir, to whom Othin and Thor belonged, and according to the"
16293,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,mythology had been given to the latter as hostages. Of the other
16294,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,deities those who figure most prominently in mythical stories are Frigg
16295,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"(Othin's wife), Ullr, Hoenir, Týr, Heimdallr, Iðun, Gefion and Balder;"
16296,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,but we seldom hear of worship paid to any of these.
16297,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16298,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,In the Edda all the gods together form a regularly organised community.
16299,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Their home is called Ásgarðr, and they hold their meetings beside the"
16300,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"'world-tree,' Yggdrasill's Ash. It is to be observed that Ásgarðr is a"
16301,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,totally different conception from Valhalla[590]; it is not an abode of
16302,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the slain. Indeed in this connection Othin himself does not appear to
16303,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,be represented as a god of the dead. But apart from Ásgarðr each god
16304,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"has a special abode of his own--Thor at Thrúðheimr, Ullr at Ýdalir,"
16305,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Niörðr at Noatún, Balder at Breiðablik, etc. All these localities"
16306,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,are mythical--or at all events incapable of identification. It is a
16307,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,striking characteristic of Northern mythology that the gods are not
16308,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,associated with any known localities. Practically the only exceptions
16309,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"are Frey and Gefion, who are connected by tradition with Upsala and"
16310,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Sjælland respectively; and neither of these connections is preserved
16311,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,in the poems of the Edda. In order to understand this feature we must
16312,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of course bear in mind the fact that our mythological records are
16313,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"almost entirely derived from Iceland, which lies far away from the old"
16314,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,national sanctuaries.
16315,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16316,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,It is probably due to the same cause that we hear but little of
16317,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"special cults. In Iceland the only noteworthy exception is that,"
16318,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"beside the more usually prevailing cult of Thor, we find a number of"
16319,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,persons who are devoted to the service of Frey. Certain chiefs bear
16320,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the title _Freysgoði_ ('priest of Frey'); in one case a whole family
16321,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,bore the surname _Freysgyðlingar_. Temples apparently sometimes
16322,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"contained the figures of a number of gods, though Thor's or Frey's is"
16323,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,usually the only one mentioned by name. In Norway however the case is
16324,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"somewhat different. We hear frequently of temples and statues of Thor,"
16325,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,occasionally also of those of Frey. But in addition to these there are
16326,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,notices of sanctuaries belonging to other deities--though not to Othin.
16327,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"In Friðþiófs Saga, cap. 1 (and passim), mention is made of a temple and"
16328,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,image of Balder in the district of Sogn. It is the fashion to treat
16329,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,this incident as a product of antiquarian speculation; but there is
16330,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"little in the story itself to justify such a view, and the fact that"
16331,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the worship of Balder is not found elsewhere proves nothing. More
16332,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,important however is the fact that in a number of records we hear of
16333,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"statues and temples of Thórgerðr Hölgabrúðr, with whom her sister Irpa"
16334,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,is sometimes associated. There can be no doubt that under the rule of
16335,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Earl Haakon of Lade the cult of Thórgerðr was more prominent than that
16336,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of any other deity, at least in the district of Trondhjem. This fact is"
16337,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the more remarkable because Thórgerðr and Irpa are never associated in
16338,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,any way with the rest of the gods; in the poems of the Edda and even in
16339,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Gylfaginning their existence is ignored.
16340,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16341,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,A very interesting illustration of the practice of special cults occurs
16342,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"in Niáls Saga, cap. 88, which describes a temple owned in common by"
16343,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Earl Haakon and Guðbrandr, a powerful _hersir_ (hereditary local chief)"
16344,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,in the highlands. This temple contained figures of Thórgerðr and Irpa
16345,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,and also of Thor in his car[591]. We know from other sources that the
16346,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,cult of Thor was hereditary in the family of Guðbrandr. Indeed it
16347,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,appears to be generally true that families adhered to the same cult
16348,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"from generation to generation[592], though in one case we do hear of"
16349,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"an Icelander bearing the title Freysgoði, who belonged to a family"
16350,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,distinguished for its service to Thor.
16351,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16352,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The relations between the worshipper and his deity were of a personal
16353,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"and intimate character; he regarded the latter as friend, counsellor"
16354,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,and protector. Where the two are of different sexes the relationship
16355,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"is apt to take a conjugal form. Thus in the Flateyiarbók, I p. 107"
16356,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"f., Olafr Tryggvason, after robbing one of Earl Haakon's temples, and"
16357,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"carrying off the image, calls out in derision: ""Who wants to buy a"
16358,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"wife? I think Thórkell and I are now responsible for this woman, since"
16359,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,she has had the misfortune to lose her husband who was exceedingly dear
16360,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"to her."" One of the bystanders then addresses the image: ""How is it,"
16361,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Thórgerðr, that thou art now so humiliated and stripped in unseemly"
16362,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,wise of the splendid apparel wherewith Earl Haakon had thee clothed
16363,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"when he loved thee?"" So in the poem Hyndlulióð Freyia speaks of her"
16364,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"devoted worshipper, Óttarr the son of Innsteinn, as her husband. We"
16365,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"may compare with this the fact that in the Flateyiarbók, I 337 f., the"
16366,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,priestess in charge of Frey's temple in Sweden is said to have been
16367,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,called his wife. I see no reason therefore for supposing that Snorri
16368,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"was giving rein to his imagination when he stated (Yngl. Saga, cap. 5)"
16369,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"that Gefion was the wife of Skiöldr who, though a mythical character"
16370,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"(cf. p. 131 f.), was not a god."
16371,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16372,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Sometimes again we meet with a definitely hostile attitude towards
16373,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,a deity--generally Othin--and it must not be supposed that such
16374,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,ideas first arose after the introduction of Christianity. In Saxo's
16375,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,translation of the lost Biarkamál the hero suspects that Othin is
16376,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,among the enemy and expresses his eagerness to attack him. If once
16377,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"he can catch sight of him, he says, the god will not escape from"
16378,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Leire unharmed[593]. Such ideas can only be explained by a vivid
16379,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,anthropomorphic conception of the deities.
16380,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16381,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"The same attitude appears elsewhere. In Gautreks Saga, cap. 7--a story"
16382,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,which contains many archaic features--we find the destiny of a man
16383,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"being determined by Othin and Thor, the former of whom is friendly"
16384,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"to him, the latter hostile. In the introduction to Grímnismál as the"
16385,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,result of a disagreement with Othin Frigg plays a trick upon him which
16386,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,leads him into serious trouble. Nor is the married life of Niörðr and
16387,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Skaði as happy as might be wished. But the chief cause of discord among
16388,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the gods is the malicious Loki. In the poem Lokasenna he charges most
16389,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of the chief goddesses with unfaithfulness or unchastity, while at the"
16390,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,same time he reproaches the gods with unseemly conduct or with being
16391,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,involved in humiliating positions. The picture of the divine community
16392,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,which the poem presents to us is anything but pleasant. No doubt Loki
16393,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,is representing every circumstance in the most unfavourable light
16394,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,possible; but there appears to be a definite mythical foundation for
16395,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,most of his charges.
16396,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16397,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Loki serves as a connecting link between the gods and the iötnar
16398,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"('giants'), a class of beings who are represented as generally hostile"
16399,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to both gods and men. Yet there are exceptions to this rule; and some
16400,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of the gods, e.g. Niörðr and Frey, have wives from the iötnar. Next"
16401,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"to them we must mention the dwarfs, who are distinguished for their"
16402,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,cunning and skill in metallurgy. Neither of these classes however
16403,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,can properly be regarded as objects of worship. Elves were certainly
16404,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"worshipped, but only collectively, as far as we know. In early records"
16405,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,they are scarcely ever spoken of as individuals. Most probably their
16406,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"origin is to be sought in animistic conceptions, connected with the"
16407,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,cult of the dead. On this last subject enough has been said above;
16408,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,we need only add that the formal deification of dead men was not
16409,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,unknown[594]. Sacred trees and groves also figure as prominently as in
16410,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,other parts of Europe.

16413,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16414,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Thus far we have been dealing with the religion of the Viking Age,"
16415,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,primarily as we know of it in Iceland and Norway. But we have seen
16416,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that the actual records of religion in Iceland agree in no way with
16417,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the theology of the Edda. Nor can it truly be said that the evidence
16418,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,for Norway shows a better case. Here too we find the worship of Thor
16419,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"and Frey. But for the worship of Othin, Niörðr, Freyia and Balder the"
16420,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,evidence is slight and generally doubtful. For that of the rest of the
16421,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,gods there is no evidence at all. On the other hand we find that the
16422,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,deity who after Thor figures most prominently of all in these records
16423,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,is one who is entirely unknown to the theology of the Edda. The only
16424,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,conclusion which it seems to me legitimate to draw from these facts is
16425,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that the mythology of the Edda is not a true reflection of Norwegian
16426,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"religion, at all events as it existed in the Viking Age."
16427,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16428,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Now let us consider the various deities individually. It will be
16429,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,convenient to begin with those whom we know to have been worshipped in
16430,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Norway or Iceland. There is no question that Thor was known not only
16431,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"in Sweden and Denmark but also in Germany and England, under the forms"
16432,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,_Donar_ and _Thunor_ respectively. Apart from local nomenclature and
16433,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the use of his name (as a translation of _dies Iouis_) in the fifth day
16434,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of the week, there are a few direct references to worship of him--e.g."
16435,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,in the inscription on a brooch found at Nordendorf in Bavaria and in a
16436,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Low German renunciation formula for the use of converts. His cult goes
16437,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"back without doubt to the Heroic Age and probably much earlier, though"
16438,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,he is apparently not mentioned by Tacitus.
16439,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16440,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"The cult of Frey was believed to have come from Sweden, as we have"
16441,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,seen. How old it was there we do not know; but there is some reason
16442,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,for believing that it was not originally confined to that country. The
16443,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Slavonic inhabitants of eastern Holstein worshipped a deity of the same
16444,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,name[595]; and the presumption is that they found the cult in existence
16445,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,when they occupied that district--not later than the seventh century.
16446,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,But the name _Yngvi_ has a much longer history and can be traced in
16447,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,various records back to the time of Tacitus. From what is said of Ing
16448,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,in the Anglo-Saxon Runic Poem it is clear that he was a perfectly
16449,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"definite, though doubtless mythical, personality[596]."
16450,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16451,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,We have already noticed that Niörðr can be traced back to a goddess
16452,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Nerthus, who was worshipped in the first century by the Angli and other"
16453,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,peoples in the south-western part of the Baltic. When the change of sex
16454,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,took place we do not know. The feminine form of the deity is probably
16455,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"preserved in Freyia, who under the name _Skialf_ seems to have her"
16456,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,roots in early Swedish tradition.
16457,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16458,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,With Othin we shall have to deal presently. There is abundant evidence
16459,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that he was known not only in Sweden and Denmark but also in England
16460,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,and at least the greater part of Germany. In the two latter countries
16461,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,he bore the names _Woden_ and _Wodan_ respectively. Even in Tacitus'
16462,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,time he appears (under the name _Mercurius_) as the chief god.
16463,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16464,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Balder's history is not so clear. From Saxo's account (p. 70 ff.)
16465,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,there can be little doubt that he was known in Denmark. The question
16466,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,whether he was recognised in Germany[597] depends practically upon the
16467,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"interpretation of the (second) Merseburg charm, to which we shall have"
16468,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to refer again shortly.
16469,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16470,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Now let us take the deities who are known to us only from the
16471,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,mythology. Both Frigg and Týr were certainly known in England and
16472,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Germany. Their names are preserved in the sixth and third days of
16473,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the week. Frigg (_Frea_) also figures, as the wife of Wodan, in the"
16474,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Langobardic story quoted above (p. 115), while Týr (_Mars_) is"
16475,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,mentioned more than once by Tacitus.
16476,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16477,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Of Ullr traces are preserved in local nomenclature both in Denmark
16478,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,and Sweden. From Saxo (p. 81 f.) it appears that he was remembered in
16479,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Danish tradition. Gefion's association with Sjælland (cf. p. 400) is
16480,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"recorded by Bragi Boddason, the earliest Scandinavian poet of whom"
16481,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,anything has been preserved. Both her name and that of Iðun can be
16482,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,traced in local nomenclature in the same island[598].
16483,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16484,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,There remain of course a large number of less important deities who
16485,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,cannot be traced outside the mythology of the Edda. Many scholars hold
16486,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that these were invented by Norwegian or Icelandic poets during the
16487,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Viking Age; but it is at least equally possible that our inability
16488,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to trace them elsewhere is due in part to the extreme poverty of our
16489,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,information. One piece of evidence which tells in favour of the latter
16490,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,view is that the Merseburg charm preserves the name of one of the least
16491,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"prominent of these deities--Fulla, the handmaid of Frigg. The fact"
16492,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,too that these poets made no attempt to incorporate Thórgerðr in the
16493,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,pantheon seems to show that in their time[599] the theological system
16494,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of the Edda was more or less crystallised. At all events it is clear
16495,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"that, with the exception of Thórgerðr and Irpa, all the deities whose"
16496,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"worship is attested were known beyond Norway, and that most of them can"
16497,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,be traced back to the Heroic Age or still earlier times.
16498,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16499,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,There is a further reason for doubting whether the theology of the
16500,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Edda was a product of late Norwegian poetry. Perhaps the most striking
16501,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"conception in this theology is that of the 'world-tree,' Yggdrasill's"
16502,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Ash. I have pointed out elsewhere[600] that this conception is largely
16503,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,derived from a tree-sanctuary and that a fairly close parallel to it
16504,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,is furnished by the description of the Upsala sanctuary given in
16505,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Adam of Bremen's history (IV 26 f.) and the annexed scholia. Similar
16506,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,sanctuaries may have existed in Norway; but we have no record of
16507,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"one which possessed the same characteristics, and it is extremely"
16508,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,improbable that any of them ever attained an importance comparable with
16509,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"that possessed by the Swedish capital. Again, there are features in the"
16510,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,picture of the 'world-tree'--I would allude especially to the presence
16511,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of snakes--for which no parallels can be found in any Scandinavian
16512,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,sanctuary of which we have record. Yet such features do occur in the
16513,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"tree-sanctuaries of more primitive peoples, especially among the"
16514,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Prussians and Lithuanians. From this it appears to me highly probable
16515,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that the conception of the world-tree dates from a comparatively
16516,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,early period. The idea of universality which it embodied cannot be
16517,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,held to prove the contrary; for this idea was possessed also by the
16518,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Irminsul[601], the sacred pillar of the Old Saxons. We have no reason"
16519,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,for doubting that a philosophical conception such as this was possible
16520,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,before the Viking Age.
16521,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16522,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,I am inclined therefore to think that the theological system of the
16523,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Edda in its main features dates from times anterior to the Viking Age.
16524,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,From earlier sources--the works of Tacitus and various German and
16525,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,English authorities--we know altogether the names of about a score of
16526,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"deities, half of whom belong to either sex. It is probable however"
16527,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that a much larger number have been lost. At all events there can be
16528,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,no doubt that the religion of the Heroic Age was a highly developed
16529,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"polytheism. Procopius (_Goth._ II 15), speaking of the inhabitants of"
16530,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"'Thule' (Scandinavia), says that they worship many gods and demons"
16531,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"(δαίμονας), both in the heavens and in the atmosphere, in the earth and"
16532,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"in the sea, besides certain other spirits (δαιμόνια) which are said to"
16533,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"be in the waters of springs and rivers. Again, in the preceding chapter"
16534,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,he states that the Heruli of central Europe worshipped a great crowd of
16535,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"gods (πολύν τινα νομίζοντες θεῶν ὅμιλον), whom they thought it right to"
16536,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,appease even with human sacrifices. Procopius' evidence is important
16537,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,not only because it is almost contemporary but also because he clearly
16538,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,distinguishes between the religion of the Teutonic peoples and that of
16539,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the Slavs. Of the latter he says (_ib._ III 14) that ""they consider"
16540,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"one god, the creator of the lightning, to have sole control over all"
16541,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"things, and they sacrifice to him oxen and offerings of all kinds...."
16542,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Yet they also reverence rivers and nymphs and some other spirits
16543,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"(δαιμόνια), and sacrifice to them all, using divination in these"
16544,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"sacrifices."" It will be seen that this type of religion is not very far"
16545,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,removed from what we find among the Thor-worshippers of Iceland.
16546,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16547,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,In an earlier chapter (p. 255) we quoted from the Life of St Ansgar
16548,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the story of a man who claimed to have been present at an assembly of
16549,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the gods. From this story it is clear that in Sweden not very long
16550,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,after the beginning of the Viking Age the gods were believed to form
16551,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,an organised community. For earlier times no such explicit information
16552,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,is to be found; but we can scarcely doubt that some similar belief
16553,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,prevailed during the Heroic Age. In the Langobardic story quoted above
16554,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"(p. 115) Fria (Frigg) is the wife of Wodan, as in the Edda. In the"
16555,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,(second) Merseburg charm we find a number of deities taking part in
16556,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,an incantation. Of the goddesses Sunna is said to be the sister of
16557,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Sinthgunt, and Volla the sister of Fria. Evidence to the same effect is"
16558,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"furnished by a letter of Bishop Daniel of Winchester to St Boniface,"
16559,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,in which the writer speaks of a genealogy of the gods and advises
16560,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,his correspondent to put awkward questions to the heathen regarding
16561,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the origin, numbers and relationships of their deities[602]. It may"
16562,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"be noted that the earlier Anglo-Saxon genealogies, which go back"
16563,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"probably to the seventh century, trace Woden's ancestry back for five"
16564,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,generations.
16565,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16566,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Of course it is not to be denied that some of the deities of whom
16567,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,we hear may have been recognised only locally or by certain nations
16568,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,or confederacies. Such an explanation is very likely in the case of
16569,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"more than one deity mentioned by Tacitus, whom we cannot identify"
16570,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,with any probability. In later times the same may be true of the
16571,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"god Fosite[603], to whom an island in the North Sea--identified with"
16572,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Heligoland by Adam of Bremen--was wholly dedicated. It is quite
16573,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"possible too that the god Seaxneat (_Saxnote_), who is mentioned in the"
16574,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Renunciation Formula and from whom the kings of Essex claimed descent,"
16575,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,was worshipped only by the Saxons.
16576,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16577,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,But even if such evidence was a good deal stronger than it actually is
16578,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,we should not be justified in inferring from it that the religion of
16579,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the Heroic Age was of an essentially national rather than universal
16580,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,character. It is not only in Northern records of the Viking Age or the
16581,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Christian period that we hear of families which were supposed to be
16582,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,descended from Othin (Woden). Out of the eight royal genealogies of the
16583,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,English kingdoms which have come down to us seven are traced back to
16584,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the same deity; and it is highly probable that most of these date from
16585,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,before the conversion[604]--i.e. from within a century of the Heroic
16586,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Age. But Woden was not a national but a universal deity.
16587,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16588,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Moreover what little we do know of this god from English and German
16589,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,sources is in full conformity with the character which he bears
16590,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,in Northern records. In the Anglo-Saxon poem on the Nine Herbs
16591,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,he is skilled in magic; in the Merseburg poem he is an expert in
16592,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,incantations. In the Langobardic story we find him represented as the
16593,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,giver of victory. In Tacitus' time he was already worshipped above the
16594,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,other gods; and human victims were offered to him. The same author
16595,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,(_Ann._ XIII 57) records the custom of dedicating a hostile army to
16596,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Mars and Mercurius--a vow which entailed the total destruction of
16597,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,everything belonging to the enemy. The great deposits of antiquities
16598,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"which have been found at Thorsbjærg, Nydam, Vi and elsewhere are"
16599,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"commonly believed to be relics of such dedicatory spoils. Finally,"
16600,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,later popular belief often placed Woden at the head of the Wild Hunt
16601,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,or ghostly army. For the existence of a conception corresponding to
16602,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Valhalla we have no explicit evidence[605]. But such a doctrine would
16603,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,clearly be in full accord with all that we know of the cult.
16604,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16605,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,In funeral rites both inhumation and cremation were practised. The
16606,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,latter custom however seems to have died out almost everywhere before
16607,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the introduction of Christianity--in England about the middle of
16608,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the sixth century, among the Franks and Alamanni much earlier. Only"
16609,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,among the Old Saxons it lingered apparently until towards the close
16610,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of the eighth century, when it was rigorously put down after their"
16611,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,subjugation[606]. How far the two practices were associated with
16612,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"different conceptions of immortality, as in the North, it is impossible"
16613,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to tell. In Beowulf (cf. p. 54) cremation is regarded as a pious duty
16614,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,owed to the dead; but all heathen references to the destiny of the soul
16615,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,hereafter have been removed from the poem. On the other hand there is
16616,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"evidence from later times for offerings at the grave, necromancy and"
16617,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,all other practices usually associated with the cult of the dead[607].
16618,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16619,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The most important piece of evidence however on this subject is
16620,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,furnished by Procopius' account of the Heruli (_Goth._ II 14). He
16621,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,states that with them it was not lawful for a man to die of old age
16622,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,or disease. When he felt himself to be dying he had to request his
16623,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,relatives to make away with him as soon as possible. They had then to
16624,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,construct a huge pyre and set the dying man in the highest part of
16625,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"it. A compatriot, though not a relative (cf. p. 346), is then sent up"
16626,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"to stab the man, and on his return the wood is immediately kindled."
16627,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,When the fire is burnt out the remains are collected and buried
16628,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"forthwith, and the widow is required to strangle herself at the tomb."
16629,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Such rites as this are commonly ascribed to the desire to set the soul
16630,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,free while in possession of its faculties. But in view of the fact
16631,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that in Northern tradition cremation is bound up with the doctrine of
16632,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Valhalla[608]--a doctrine which is in no way inconsistent with this
16633,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,explanation--it is certainly significant that the two rites should be
16634,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"associated here, more especially since the Heruli were an essentially"
16635,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,military people. On the whole the evidence of this passage is
16636,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,distinctly favourable to the view that a belief closely approximating
16637,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to the doctrine of Valhalla was prevalent during the Heroic Age.
16638,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16639,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Valkyries (_walcyrgan_) are not unfrequently mentioned in Anglo-Saxon
16640,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"literature[609], and it is clear that similar beings were known in"
16641,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Germany, though this word does not occur in extant records. In England,"
16642,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"as in the North, both human and supernatural beings were included"
16643,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"under this term, though they are not always clearly distinguished from"
16644,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"witches. But, more than this, the poetic description of valkyries"
16645,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,which we find in the Edda[610] can likewise be traced in Anglo-Saxon
16646,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,poetry. In a charm against sudden pains we hear of mighty women who
16647,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"rode over the hill, mustered their host and cast their spears. The"
16648,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,idea that sudden pains were due to the agency of such beings[611]
16649,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,comes doubtless from popular belief; but the description cannot be
16650,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"accounted for in this way. Again, in the (first) Merseburg charm we"
16651,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,find supernatural women (_idisi_) taking part in a battle; and it is to
16652,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,be remembered that the word _walcyrge_ can hardly mean anything else
16653,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,than 'chooser of the slain.' Certainly we have no evidence to prove--or
16654,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,disprove--that the valkyries were associated with Woden in early times.
16655,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,But the features noted here again point clearly to the existence of a
16656,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"conception akin to Valhalla and, what is more, to the poetic treatment"
16657,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of such a conception.
16658,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16659,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,In the course of this discussion[612] I have endeavoured to point out
16660,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that the theological system of the Edda cannot properly be regarded as
16661,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"an invention of (Norwegian-Icelandic) poets of the Viking Age--that, on"
16662,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the contrary, it is derived in great measure from much earlier times."
16663,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,I do not mean to deny that the growth of the system has been very
16664,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,largely influenced by poetry. But the evidence seems to me to show that
16665,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the poetic treatment of the subject had begun--and probably more than
16666,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,begun--in the Heroic Age and among many of the Teutonic peoples. It
16667,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,is perfectly true that the notices of Teutonic religion contained in
16668,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Tacitus' works convey the impression that religion was regarded as a
16669,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,very serious matter and that the general attitude towards the gods was
16670,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,highly reverential. The same impression is conveyed by Alcuin's account
16671,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of Fositesland; and probably no one will deny that the euthanasia of
16672,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the Heruli was based upon a very real conception of immortality. But
16673,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to compare such records with the poetry of the Edda would manifestly
16674,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,be absurd. For analogies to them we must turn to notices relating to
16675,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"actual religion, and here we shall find evidence that the people of the"
16676,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Viking Age were no less religious than those of earlier times. We may
16677,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,instance the reverence shown by Thórolfr of Mostr to his holy hill and
16678,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Earl Haakon's devotion to Thórgerðr Hölgabrúðr.
16679,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16680,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,On the other hand the attitude towards the gods shown in the Edda finds
16681,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,an exact analogy in the only record of 'theological' poetry which has
16682,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,survived from the Heroic Age. In the Langobardic story (cf. p. 115) the
16683,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,anthropomorphisation of the deities is already complete; and the chief
16684,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,god[613] is duped by his wife. We could scarcely wish for a better
16685,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,parallel to the account given in the introduction to Grímnismál. In
16686,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"view of this story it is scarcely possible to doubt that familiarity,"
16687,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"not to say levity, in the treatment of the gods characterised the"
16688,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"poetry of the Heroic Age, just as much as that of the Viking Age."
16689,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16690,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,It would be well to hesitate however before assuming that the gods of
16691,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Tacitus' time were treated in the same way. His account shows that
16692,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Teutonic theology had then passed beyond the purely tribal stage,"
16693,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"and that certain deities were worshipped by a number of peoples, if"
16694,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,not universally. But it does not suggest the existence of a highly
16695,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,anthropomorphic conception of the gods. Further we have to bear in mind
16696,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that Tacitus is separated only by a century and a half from Caesar.
16697,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The account of German religion given by the latter (_B. Gall._ VI 21)
16698,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,is difficult to account for by any explanation. But unless we are to
16699,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,believe that Caesar was thoroughly imposed upon we must conclude that
16700,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,nothing in the nature of a developed polytheism can have existed in his
16701,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,day. To the theology of the Heroic Age his account of the Gaulish gods
16702,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,(_ib._ VI 17) would be far more applicable than what he says regarding
16703,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the worship of the Germans.
16704,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16705,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The question we have been discussing appears to throw some light
16706,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,upon the rapidity with which most of the Teutonic peoples accepted
16707,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Christianity. The facts which we know with regard to the conversion are
16708,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,as follows: (1) that it almost invariably began in the king's court;
16709,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"(2) that violent opposition was offered only in kingless communities,"
16710,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"as among the Old Saxons, or in defiance of the king's authority, as in"
16711,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Norway; (3) that after the conversion the gods (in general) disappear
16712,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,at once and for good; (4) that magical practices and the belief in
16713,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"spirits and even in certain female agricultural deities ('Erce,' Holda,"
16714,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Berhta, etc.) lasted among the country people for many centuries. From"
16715,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,(4) we may probably infer that the religion of the country people
16716,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"was chiefly animistic--similar no doubt to what we find in Iceland,"
16717,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,with the exception that we have little evidence for the cult of the
16718,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"thunder-god. Again, the explanation of (3) hangs together with (1);"
16719,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,for the statements of ecclesiastical writers render it clear that the
16720,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,religion of the courts was essentially theistic. But it is plain from
16721,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the discussion in the Northumbrian council recorded by Bede (_H. E._
16722,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,II 13)--the only discussion of this kind of which we have any detailed
16723,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,account--that here at least this religion retained little vital
16724,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"force[614]. This fact is fully explained if, as I have endeavoured to"
16725,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"point out, theology had largely passed from the realm of dogma into"
16726,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that of poetry.
16727,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16728,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"The conclusion then to which we are brought is that Teutonic religion,"
16729,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"at all events in the courts, underwent a profound change in the course"
16730,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of the Heroic Age. It is to be observed that in the earlier part of
16731,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"that age--as in the earlier part of the Viking Age--we find, especially"
16732,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"among the more northern peoples, a fanatical devotion to warfare"
16733,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"for its own sake, accompanied by lust for destruction and apparently"
16734,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,also by a vivid conception of a life hereafter. In the latter part
16735,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of the Heroic Age these phenomena disappear, except among the Heruli"
16736,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"who, according to Procopius, differed from all the rest of mankind."
16737,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The ideal which the princes of the later period set before themselves
16738,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,may be gathered both from Beowulf and from Roman authorities; it was
16739,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to enjoy wealth and splendour in this life and to have their fame
16740,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,celebrated by future generations. For their attitude towards a future
16741,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,life the speech of the Northumbrian councillor recorded by Bede
16742,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,(_l.c._) may probably be regarded as typical[615].

16746,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,In a work such as this it is scarcely necessary to give even a brief
16747,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"summary of the characteristics of Greek religion, since the main"
16748,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,outlines of the subject are probably much more familiar than those
16749,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of even the later religion of the North. At the same time the amount
16750,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of information which has been preserved is so great and the unsolved
16751,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,problems presented by the subject so numerous that it is clearly
16752,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,better left in the hands of experts. I shall attempt no more therefore
16753,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,than to call attention to the salient points in which the religion of
16754,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the Homeric poems differs from that of later times and to the chief
16755,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,characteristics in which the former resembles or differs from the
16756,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,religion of the Teutonic Heroic Age and the Viking Age.
16757,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16758,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The various objects of worship recognised in Greece belong in general
16759,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to much the same categories as those which we have noticed above. They
16760,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"may be classified roughly as gods, genii locorum and manes. In the last"
16761,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"class we may perhaps include the 'heroes,' though the position occupied"
16762,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,by them is somewhat peculiar. They were for the most part characters
16763,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of the Heroic Age, and sometimes we find the cult of the same hero"
16764,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,recognised in a number of different states. In general the worship of
16765,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the gods took a different form from that paid to the manes and heroes,"
16766,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,though occasionally the cult of a deity seems to have been associated
16767,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"with, or superimposed upon, that of a hero."
16768,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16769,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,In the Homeric poems the gods figure much more prominently than the
16770,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"other classes. The most frequently mentioned of them are Zeus, Hera,"
16771,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Poseidon, Athene, Apollo, Artemis, Hephaistos, Aphrodite, Ares and"
16772,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Hermes. Zeus, as head of the divine community, corresponds to Othin"
16773,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,(Woden); but in other respects there is little resemblance between the
16774,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"two. As god of the thunder his affinities are rather with Thor. Hera,"
16775,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"as wife of the chief god, may be compared with Frigg, while Poseidon,"
16776,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"as god of the sea, has an element in common with Niörðr; but he is also"
16777,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"an earthquake god, which the latter is not. His characterisation also"
16778,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"is much more clearly marked. Apollo and Artemis, as a pair of young"
16779,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"deities, brother and sister, with certain characteristics in common,"
16780,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"bear some resemblance to Frey and Freyia; but the sexual element, so"
16781,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"prominent in the Northern deities, is wanting in the Homeric poems."
16782,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,On the whole the translator of the Icelandic New Testament seems
16783,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to have been happily inspired in rendering _Diana_ (Artemis) by
16784,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"_Gefion_[616], while Freyia's true counterpart is rather to be found"
16785,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"in Aphrodite[617]. Hephaistos, the smith of the divine community, has"
16786,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,no Northern god corresponding to him; as the maker of heroes' armour
16787,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"and other metal objects he plays the same part as Weland. Ares, as god"
16788,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of war, has an element in common with Týr. The Homeric Hermes bears no"
16789,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,resemblance to Othin; his duties are to a certain extent discharged
16790,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,by the valkyries in Northern mythology. Athene is a character totally
16791,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,foreign to Northern theology.
16792,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16793,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"All the above deities, together with a number of others less important,"
16794,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"form a regularly organised community, like the Aesir. Their home"
16795,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,is located on Mount Olympos in the north of Thessaly--a conception
16796,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"probably more primitive than Ásgarðr, which is never represented as a"
16797,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"place known to the human race. But, though Olympos is the home of the"
16798,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"gods collectively, most of them (like the Northern deities) have also"
16799,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"one or more dwelling-places of their own, often in distant localities."
16800,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Thus Poseidon's home is at Aigai and Apollo's at Delphoi, though he"
16801,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,is also connected with several localities on the eastern side of the
16802,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Aegean--Chryse, Cille, Tenedos, etc. Athene has a home at Athens, while"
16803,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Hephaistos is connected with Lemnos, Ares with Thrace and Aphrodite"
16804,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"with Paphos in Cyprus. Zeus himself, apart from Olympos, has abodes at"
16805,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Dodona and Ida.
16806,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16807,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The belief that the gods had homes of their own in various localities
16808,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,is clearly to be taken in connection with the fact that they are said
16809,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"to have sanctuaries in the same places. Thus Aigai is mentioned,"
16810,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"together with Helice, as a place where sacrifices were offered to"
16811,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Poseidon (Il. VIII 203 f.). Zeus' home at Dodona is his sanctuary
16812,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"(_ib._, XVI 233 ff.), and it is to her sanctuary at Paphos that"
16813,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Aphrodite goes (Od. VIII 362 f.). We need not doubt therefore that,"
16814,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"as in later times, the cults of the various deities were largely of"
16815,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,a local character. It is a different question of course whether the
16816,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,cults--or rather the deities themselves--were of local or tribal
16817,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,origin; but in certain cases such an explanation appears to be by no
16818,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,means improbable. Many scholars believe that Ares was originally a
16819,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Thracian deity; and the fact that he is represented as the father of
16820,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Boeotian heroes can scarcely be regarded as conclusive evidence to the
16821,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"contrary. In Il. IV 51 f. Hera states that three cities, Argos, Mycenae"
16822,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"and Sparta, are specially dear to her; and there is little evidence"
16823,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that her cult was ever prominent in any other part of the Greek
16824,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,mainland. If the same explanation is true of such deities as Apollo
16825,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,and Aphrodite we must suppose either that their cults have spread
16826,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,from one locality to another or that deities belonging to different
16827,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"localities have been identified. The local origin of river gods, such"
16828,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"as Spercheios and Scamandros, is of course clear enough; but these are"
16829,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,little more than genii locorum.
16830,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16831,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,But the really important feature in Homeric theology is that the
16832,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"various deities, whether of local origin or not, are all brought"
16833,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"together as members of one community, or rather family, and that as"
16834,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,such they are represented as meeting with universal recognition.
16835,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Indeed, they are not regarded even as peculiar to the Greek race; the"
16836,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Trojans recognise the same divinities, and Poseidon goes to receive"
16837,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"sacrifices even from the Ethiopians. A similar, though less important,"
16838,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"community is that of the marine deities, one of whom, Thetis, figures"
16839,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,prominently in the Iliad.
16840,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16841,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The spirit in which the gods are treated is in general very similar to
16842,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"what we find in the Edda, and in no way more reverential. Sometimes the"
16843,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"treatment is humorous, as in Thrymskviða; sometimes again the deities"
16844,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,are represented in a very unfavourable light. For the trick played
16845,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,upon Wodan by Fria in the Langobardic story (cf. p. 115) we have an
16846,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"interesting parallel in Il. XIV 292-353, where Hera distracts Zeus'"
16847,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,attention from the war and coaxes him to sleep. But this is only one
16848,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of a number of incidents which give a generally unpleasant picture of
16849,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the domestic life of this pair, much more so than is the case with"
16850,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Othin and Frigg in the Edda. Again, the story of Ares and Aphrodite,"
16851,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"which forms the subject of Demodocos' lay (Od. VIII 266-366), is very"
16852,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,much what we should expect to find in a poem dealing at length with the
16853,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,scandalous charges brought against the goddesses in Lokasenna. Ares'
16854,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,speech in v. 292 ff.--as also Hermes' remarks in v. 339 ff.--may be
16855,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,compared with those of Frey in Skírnismál. In the Iliad the same two
16856,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,deities are more than once treated contemptuously.
16857,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16858,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The same spirit is shown in the treatment of the relations of gods with
16859,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,men. It is frequently recognised that deities ought to show gratitude
16860,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"to their worshippers for the sacrifices offered to them, as Freyia does"
16861,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"in Hyndlulióð, though at the same time they are at liberty to refuse a"
16862,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"petition, as in Il. VI 311--a case which may be compared with Frey's"
16863,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,conduct in Víga-Glúms Saga (cf. p. 253). In the Iliad we find several
16864,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"deities taking an active interest in the fortunes of the war--Poseidon,"
16865,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Hera and Athene on the side of the Achaeans, and Apollo, Ares and"
16866,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Aphrodite on that of the Trojans. Poseidon more than once comes to
16867,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"rouse the Achaeans, when he thinks they are becoming slack. Apollo and"
16868,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Athene interfere in the struggle in a manner which strikes the reader
16869,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,as unfair; indeed the latter is frequently guilty of flagrantly mean
16870,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,and dishonourable conduct towards her opponents. The attitude of the
16871,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,heroes themselves to the gods is quite in keeping with the way in which
16872,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the latter treat them. Achilles openly abuses Apollo for deceiving
16873,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,him (Il. XXII 15 ff.); and Diomedes attacks and wounds both Ares and
16874,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Aphrodite, but only after assurances or assistance from Athene. In"
16875,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,this respect the Homeric princes are not quite so bold as the hero of
16876,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Biarkamál (cf. p. 402 f.).
16877,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16878,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,But it is by no means only towards communities that the deities
16879,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,display their favour or hatred. Indeed their attitude towards the
16880,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,contending forces at Troy seems to be largely determined by their
16881,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"relations with certain individuals, especially Helen and Paris. In"
16882,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the Odyssey Poseidon is represented as persecuting Odysseus, one of"
16883,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the Achaean leaders, for many years on account of the injury done"
16884,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,by him to Polyphemos. On the other hand both this hero and Diomedes
16885,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,enjoy the special favour of Athene. It is worth noting that Diomedes
16886,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,appears to have inherited this favour from his father (cf. Il. V 800
16887,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"ff.), and the same may be true in the case of Odysseus (cf. Od. XXIV"
16888,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"367 ff., 517 ff.); at all events it is continued towards his son."
16889,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"In neither of these cases is any hint given of conjugal relations,"
16890,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,such as we find in the North; indeed the sexual element seems to be
16891,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,practically absent from Athene. Elsewhere however such relations are
16892,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"clearly involved, e.g. in the cases of Aineias and Achilles, who are"
16893,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the sons of Aphrodite and Thetis respectively. In the Odyssey (V 119
16894,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,ff.) the principle is stated plainly; and the hero himself has conjugal
16895,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"relations with Circe and Calypso, both of whom are described as"
16896,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,goddesses.
16897,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16898,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Of other mythical beings the genii locorum are perhaps the most
16899,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,prominent. The distinction between them and the class with which we
16900,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,have been dealing is by no means so clearly drawn as in the north of
16901,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Europe (cf. p. 407 f.). Many of them are even described as gods (θεοί).
16902,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"River gods, such as Spercheios and Axios, are represented as the"
16903,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"fathers or ancestors of several heroes. Among other, less important,"
16904,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,beings of the same type we may mention the nymphs[618] to whom certain
16905,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"caves and springs were sacred (e.g. Od. XIII 347 ff., XVII 205 ff., 240"
16906,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,ff.).
16907,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16908,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,References to chthonic deities are not very frequent. The Erinyes
16909,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"are mentioned several times, especially in curses; but they are"
16910,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"not individualised, though the singular is occasionally used. The"
16911,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"most important person in the under-world appears to be the queen,"
16912,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Persephoneia; but she is never actually brought upon the scene. Hades
16913,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,himself is seldom more than a name.
16914,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16915,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The sacrifices to the gods mentioned in the Homeric poems are as a rule
16916,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,similar to the sacrificial feasts of which we hear in the North.[619]
16917,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"A portion of the victims, usually bulls or rams, was offered to the"
16918,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"deity, while the rest was consumed by the worshippers. On the other"
16919,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,hand we hear occasionally of victims which were given wholly to the
16920,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,gods. Such appears to have been the case with the victims sacrificed
16921,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,on the occasion of a solemn oath; thus in Il. XIX 267 f. the boar is
16922,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,thrown into the sea[620]. It is perhaps worth noting that both here and
16923,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"in III 276 ff. the oath refers to chthonic deities[621], as well as to"
16924,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Zeus, the Sun and Earth. Victims sacrificed to the dead likewise seem"
16925,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to be offered entire (e.g. Od. XI 44 ff.; Il. XXIII 166 ff.). Moreover
16926,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,it is only in connection with funeral rites that we hear of human
16927,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"sacrifices, namely when Achilles puts to death twelve Trojan youths"
16928,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"at the pyre of Patroclos (_ib._, 175 f.). Horses and dogs are also"
16929,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"sacrificed on this occasion, as well as oxen and sheep, and the whole"
16930,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,scene is in accordance with Northern custom. No mention is made in the
16931,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"poems of sacrifices such as that of Polyxene, which form so favourite a"
16932,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,theme with the dramatists; but in view of the Northern evidence[622] we
16933,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,are entitled to doubt whether they are altogether inventions of later
16934,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,times.
16935,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16936,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,The theology of the Homeric poems received formal recognition in
16937,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Greece down to the acceptance of Christianity; but there is no evidence
16938,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,that the system as a whole possessed any vital force even in the
16939,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,earliest times of which we have record. From the sixth century onwards
16940,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,poets and philosophers began to regard Zeus as much more than the chief
16941,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of the gods; but even in popular religion it appears that each state
16942,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"honoured certain deities, while the rest were largely or altogether"
16943,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,neglected. Thus at Athens more prominence seems to have been given to
16944,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Athene, and perhaps also to Poseidon, than to Zeus, while Hera was"
16945,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"predominant at Argos and Samos, and Apollo at Delphoi, etc. This is"
16946,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"a feature for which the Homeric poems themselves give evidence, as"
16947,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"we have seen, and there is no reason whatever for supposing it to be"
16948,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of later growth. Sometimes too we find prominence given to deities,"
16949,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"such as Demeter and Dionysos, who seem to be of little consequence in"
16950,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the Homeric poems, while other cults, such as that of Serapis, were"
16951,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,introduced from abroad in comparatively late times.
16952,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16953,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Chthonic deities are more prominent in later literature than in the
16954,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Homeric poems; and many authors describe the worship paid to them down
16955,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,to a comparatively late period. Yet the rites seem to have been of
16956,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,a primitive character. But perhaps the most striking element in the
16957,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,religion of classical Greece was the worship of 'heroes.' Every city
16958,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"possessed shrines (ἡρῷα), at which sacrifices were offered to heroes"
16959,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,with rites similar in general to those used in the worship of chthonic
16960,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,deities. Originally these heroes seem to have been local persons and
16961,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the shrines their tombs; but characters prominent in heroic poetry
16962,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,sometimes received worship in many different states.
16963,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16964,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,In the Homeric poems there is no evidence for this hero-worship. Indeed
16965,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"these poems contain few traces of a cult of the manes at all, except"
16966,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,in funeral ceremonies and in connection with the necromantic sacrifice
16967,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of Odysseus. This fact has been connected with the Homeric doctrine
16968,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"of immortality[623], and in view of the Northern evidence (cf. p. 397"
16969,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,ff.) there can be little doubt that the true explanation is to be found
16970,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"herein. The method used in the disposal of the dead is cremation,"
16971,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"and, as in the North, it was believed that this sent the spirit away"
16972,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,from the body to a place of the dead--not a separate place for each
16973,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,particular family or community but a common home for the souls of the
16974,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,whole Greek race. In Il. XXIII 65 ff. the spirit of Patroclos comes and
16975,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"exhorts Achilles to pay him the last rites: ""Never again shall I return"
16976,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"from Hades, when ye have allotted me the due of fire"" (V. 75 f.). So"
16977,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,also when Odysseus visits the home of Hades the first spirit he meets
16978,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"is that of his follower Elpenor, who reproaches him with not attending"
16979,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"to his obsequies and begs him, when he returns to Circe's island, to"
16980,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"""burn him up with his arms, all that he possesses."" The idea is clearly"
16981,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the same as in Ynglinga Saga, cap. 8. The honourable way therefore to"
16982,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"treat a fallen foe is not to strip him but to burn him with his armour,"
16983,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,as in Il. VI 417 ff.[624] Even at the beginning of the historical
16984,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,period this belief seems not to have entirely died out. According to
16985,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the story told by Herodotus (v. 92), when Periandros sent to consult"
16986,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the spirit of his wife Melissa, she complained that the clothes which"
16987,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,he had given her at her funeral were of no use because they had not
16988,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,been burnt.
16989,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
16990,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,It has already been mentioned (p. 261) that this story seems to show
16991,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"that at one time the home of the dead was located in a definite, though"
16992,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"probably not very well known, region; and the vague indications given"
16993,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,as to the hero's wanderings in the Odyssey can hardly be regarded as
16994,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,evidence to the contrary. If this is correct the home of Hades is in
16995,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"one respect probably a more primitive conception than Valhalla, just as"
16996,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Olympos is more primitive than Ásgarðr. A reasonable explanation would
16997,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,be offered if we had evidence that part of the population of Greece
16998,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,was believed to have come from that region[625]. An idea of this kind
16999,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,was certainly in Snorri's mind when he wrote the Ynglinga Saga; but
17000,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"unfortunately the account which he has given is obviously, at least to"
17001,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"a large extent, of scholastic origin."
17002,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
17003,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,In other respects however the Homeric conception of immortality
17004,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"appears to be less simple than the doctrine of Valhalla, as we find"
17005,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,it in certain Northern records. The use of the verbs θάπτειν and
17006,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,ταρχύσουσι is probably capable of a different explanation; but there
17007,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"are certain other words and expressions, e.g. κατῆλθεν, ἔνεροι, Ζεὺς"
17008,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"καταχθόνιος (Hades; cf. also Il. XX 61 ff.), which seem to point to"
17009,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,a belief that the world of the dead was beneath the earth. That is
17010,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the conception implied in certain local beliefs which we meet with in
17011,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"later times, at Hermione and elsewhere, where a deep cavern or lake was"
17012,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,supposed to lead thither. More important however is the fact that the
17013,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,home of Hades is totally devoid of the attractiveness of Valhalla; the
17014,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,gloomy picture which is drawn of it accords rather with the Northern
17015,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"home of Hel. The burning of the body, together with armour and funeral"
17016,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"sacrifices, appears to procure little real advantage to the soul; it"
17017,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"is regarded, as in Beowulf, rather in the nature of an honour due to"
17018,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the deceased. Yet in view of the parallels which we possess, both from"
17019,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"the North and elsewhere[626], we can scarcely doubt that the custom had"
17020,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"its origin in a much stronger motive, the force of which was scarcely"
17021,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"appreciated in later times. For a change of feeling, if not of actual"
17022,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"faith, positive evidence is supplied by the reprobation expressed in"
17023,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Il. XXIII 176--a passage as significant in its way as the homiletic
17024,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,verses which follow the reference to heathen sacrifices in Beow. 175

17028,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
17029,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,In the course of this chapter we have noticed a considerable number
17030,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of features common to Greek and Teutonic religion. Many of them are
17031,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"to be found in other religions also, and these we need not discuss"
17032,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,further. Here we are concerned only to determine what may be regarded
17033,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,as characteristic of the Heroic Age. In this category we may probably
17034,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,include the following features.
17035,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
17036,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"1. The religion was predominantly a worship of gods, rather than of"
17037,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,spirits. Herein lies the chief contrast with the religion of later
17038,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,times in both regions[627]. In Classical Greece chthonic worship and
17039,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,hero worship seem on the whole to be more prominent than that of the
17040,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,gods. The same is true of Scandinavian countries in the latest heathen
17041,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"period, though Thor is still prominent and hero worship is scarcely"
17042,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"distinguished from manes worship. In Germany and England, where"
17043,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Christianity was adopted during the Heroic Age or soon afterwards, the"
17044,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"gods disappear at once, while forms of chthonic worship survive for"
17045,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,centuries.
17046,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
17047,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"2. The same gods were, to a large extent at least, recognised"
17048,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,everywhere. Whether by borrowing or by identification of cults they had
17049,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,ceased to be merely tribal deities. How far back this feature goes in
17050,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Greece we cannot tell. Among the Teutonic peoples we can trace it in
17051,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,part back to Tacitus' time; but it was probably intensified during the
17052,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Heroic Age.
17053,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
17054,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,3. The conception of the gods was definitely anthropomorphic. For
17055,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the Teutonic Heroic Age this is made clear by the Langobardic story.
17056,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,There is no absolutely conclusive proof that the gods in general were
17057,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"regarded as forming a regularly organised community, as in the Edda and"
17058,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the Homeric poems; but all the evidence which we have (cf. p. 407 f.)
17059,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,points in this direction.
17060,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
17061,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,4. The relations between gods and human beings are of a somewhat
17062,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,peculiar character both in Teutonic poetry and in the Homeric poems;
17063,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,but they are almost identical in the two cases. The gods are not
17064,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,treated with any very great reverence. The conduct attributed to them
17065,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"is not unfrequently reprehensible, their purposes can often be thwarted"
17066,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"by the help of other gods, and the bravest warriors are sometimes even"
17067,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,ready to attack them openly. Yet the human and the divine are not
17068,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"confused; a man is not a god, though many heroes, both Teutonic and"
17069,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"Greek, are sprung from gods. It should be observed that the deity from"
17070,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"whom most English princes claimed descent is Woden, a universal and not"
17071,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,a tribal god. This belief must be regarded as an anti-tribal force.
17072,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
17073,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,5. Both in Northern tradition and in the Homeric poems the practice of
17074,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,cremation was associated with the belief in a common home for the souls
17075,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of the dead. This practice does not appear to have been common even
17076,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,in the earlier part of the Viking Age; and consequently the tradition
17077,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"probably comes down from the Heroic Age, at which time we know that"
17078,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,cremation was widely prevalent. The cheerless home of Hades[628]
17079,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"differs considerably from Valhalla, though there is some ground for"
17080,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,suspecting that the Greeks of the Heroic Age had once cherished a
17081,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,belief endowed with greater vitality. But both conceptions possess
17082,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"certain essential features in common, namely the removal of the soul to"
17083,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,a distant place--a belief really incompatible with the local worship of
17084,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,heroes or manes--and the fact that this distant place of souls was a
17085,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,universal home and not reserved for the souls of one tribe. This belief
17086,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,again was doubtless an anti-tribal force of considerable importance.
17087,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,
17088,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,Briefly then we may define as the predominant characteristic of
17089,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"heroic religion, both Greek and Teutonic, the subordination of"
17090,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"chthonic and tribal cults, which as a rule go together, to the worship"
17091,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,of a number of universally recognised and highly anthropomorphic
17092,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,deities--coupled with the belief in a common and distant land of souls.
17093,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"These characteristics, at all events among the Teutonic peoples,"
17094,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,seem properly to have belonged only to the religion of the royal and
17095,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"military classes. Hence, when the royal families are converted to a new"
17096,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,"faith, as in England, or when kingless states grow up, as in Iceland,"
17097,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,we find in all cases more or less of a reversion to the more primitive
17098,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,forms of religion. It is on the same principle that I would account for
17099,RELIGION IN THE HEROIC AGE.,the differences in religion between heroic and historical Greece.

17377,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,
17378,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,
17379,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,In the last three chapters we have confined our attention almost
17380,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,exclusively to the Teutonic and Greek Heroic Ages. It is not to be
17381,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,overlooked however that similar phenomena occur elsewhere. The closest
17382,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"and most interesting parallels, at least in Europe, are probably to be"
17383,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,found in the history of the ancient Gauls.
17384,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,
17385,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,It has been mentioned above that Gaulish literature has entirely
17386,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,perished. We are dependent therefore for our information upon a few
17387,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,scattered references in the works of Greek and Roman writers. These
17388,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,however are sufficient to show that the Gauls possessed a well-known
17389,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"and influential class of professional minstrels (βάρδοι), whose chief"
17390,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,occupation seems to have been the composition of heroic poetry[629].
17391,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,Like the minstrels of the Teutonic and Greek Heroic Ages these persons
17392,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"were attached to the courts of kings, and their poems dealt with the"
17393,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,praises of living princes as well as with the deeds of heroes of the
17394,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"past[630]. With the disappearance of kingship, early in the first"
17395,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"century (B.C.), their standing seems to have been impaired. At all"
17396,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"events they are never mentioned by Caesar, who has so much to say about"
17397,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,the Druids.
17398,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,
17399,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,It is probable therefore that by this time what may be termed the
17400,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,Gaulish Heroic Age was already at an end. How long it had lasted we
17401,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"cannot tell, since all the stories have perished. We may certainly note"
17402,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,however that the accounts of Gaulish life which have come down to us
17403,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,from the time before the nation became Romanised show a most striking
17404,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,resemblance to the conditions described in Teutonic and Greek heroic
17405,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,poetry. The longest of these accounts is the one given by Diodoros
17406,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"(V 26 ff.), where their customs are described with a considerable"
17407,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,amount of detail. The picture which he draws of their methods of
17408,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"fighting, their love of boasting[631], their habits in entertaining"
17409,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,strangers[632] and many other particulars furnishes a parallel to
17410,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,Homeric life closer perhaps than may be found even in Anglo-Saxon
17411,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,poetry.
17412,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,
17413,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,The principle of personal allegiance seems to have been developed among
17414,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"the Gauls to a very high degree, although our information dates chiefly"
17415,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,from times when kingship had almost entirely disappeared. We have
17416,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,scarcely sufficient evidence for determining whether the development
17417,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,of this principle had been accompanied by a relaxation of the bonds
17418,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"of kindred. But Caesar's statement (_Gall._, VI 11) regarding the"
17419,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,universal prevalence of party spirit points in this direction[633]; and
17420,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,it is perhaps worth noting that attempts were made upon the lives of
17421,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,more than one of the princes who had submitted to him. There is reason
17422,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"for suspecting that among the Celtic peoples, as among the Teutonic,"
17423,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"the organisation of the kindred had undergone a change, probably at"
17424,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,no very remote period. The Picts adhered to succession in the female
17425,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"line, at all events in the royal family, down to the eighth century;"
17426,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,and there are said to be traces of the same type of succession in
17427,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,Ireland. It is commonly assumed that the Pictish succession was a
17428,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,pre-Celtic institution; but no evidence worth consideration has been
17429,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,adduced in favour of this view. We need not doubt the existence of
17430,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,pre-Celtic inhabitants in Scotland. But the same remark applies to the
17431,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"rest of the British Isles and at least a considerable part of Gaul,"
17432,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,and I see no reason why in Scotland alone (or Scotland and Ireland) so
17433,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,important a change should have been taken over from the aborigines. In
17434,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,Gaul succession certainly passed in the male line in the first century
17435,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,(B.C.). But in the earliest Gaulish tradition of which we have record
17436,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"the title to sovereignty seems to go, as among the Picts, to the sons"
17437,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,of the king's sister[634].
17438,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,
17439,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,The political organisation of the Gauls appears to have been similar
17440,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"to that of the Teutonic peoples, though kingship was dying out in"
17441,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,the first century. We find a considerable number of comparatively
17442,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"small nations (_ciuitates_), each of which apparently possessed a"
17443,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,royal family of its own. From time to time one of these acquired a
17444,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,position of supremacy over all or many of the others. Sometimes too
17445,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,sections of the same nation appear in widely different regions. Thus
17446,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"we find Senones and Lingones both in Gaul and Italy, Boii in Bavaria"
17447,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"(Bohemia) and Italy, Volcae Tectosages in Germany and the south of"
17448,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,Gaul--Tectosages also in Galatia. There is little doubt that in such
17449,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,cases one of these sections is an offshoot from the other and owes its
17450,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,origin to some military expedition.
17451,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,
17452,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"In regard to religion Caesar (_ib._, VI 21) draws a striking contrast"
17453,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"between the Gauls and the Germans, though his account of the latter in"
17454,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,this respect will not hold good for the Heroic Age. Gaulish religion
17455,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,was polytheistic and highly anthropomorphic; it would seem also that
17456,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,the gods were regarded as forming an organised community. The method
17457,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,employed in the disposal of the dead was cremation; and here too this
17458,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,practice was associated with a vivid conception of immortality. In
17459,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,all these respects Gaulish religion seems to have differed little
17460,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"from the types which we find in the Teutonic and Greek Heroic Ages,"
17461,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,although apparently the belief in immortality largely took the form of
17462,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,metempsychosis. Only in one particular can we detect a really important
17463,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"difference between Gaulish religion and the others, namely in the"
17464,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,influence of the priesthood. This feature however seems to have been
17465,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,peculiar to Gaul itself and Britain; at all events we hear nothing of
17466,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,Druids elsewhere. Indeed according to Caesar (VI 13) the institution
17467,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,was believed to have originated in Britain; and it is by no means
17468,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,impossible that some of its characteristic features may have developed
17469,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"in this country. More than this we cannot safely say, since there is"
17470,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,an obvious--and probably by no means superficial--resemblance between
17471,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,Druidism and the priesthood of the Prussians and Lithuanians.

17474,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,
17475,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,In previous Notes (p. 101 ff.) we spoke of two other Heroic Ages--those
17476,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"of the Bosnian Mohammedans, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,"
17477,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"and of the Cumbrian Welsh, about a thousand years earlier. In Note VII"
17478,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,we discussed briefly one of the leading incidents in the (Christian)
17479,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"Servian Heroic Age, of the fourteenth century. In all these cases the"
17480,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,question of religion is better left out of account; for though the form
17481,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,taken by Christianity or Mohammedanism was doubtless influenced to some
17482,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"extent by national characteristics, the two religions were essentially"
17483,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,of foreign origin.
17484,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,
17485,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,Among the Bosnians however the influence of Mohammedanism affected also
17486,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"the organisation of society, while the government was in the hands of"
17487,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,pashas sent from Constantinople. On the whole the conditions appear to
17488,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,have little in common with those of the Teutonic and Greek Heroic Ages.
17489,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,Even the principle of personal allegiance is not much in evidence.
17490,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,
17491,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,On the other hand this principle is very prominent in the Christian
17492,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"Servian poems, at all events in those which deal with the battle of"
17493,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,Kossovo. It is exemplified both in the relations of squires (such
17494,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,as Vaistina) with their lords and in those of the latter with the
17495,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"king. In the poem on the banquet (Karadžić, II 50 iii), which we have"
17496,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"discussed above (p. 315), it is to this principle alone that Lazar"
17497,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"appeals, when he reproaches Miloš for his suspected disloyalty; and"
17498,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,though the latter in his reply does mention that he intends to die for
17499,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"the Christian faith, he too evidently regards loyalty to his king as"
17500,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,his primary duty. My knowledge of this subject is unfortunately not
17501,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,sufficient to enable me to form an opinion as to whether the growth
17502,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,of the bond of allegiance was accompanied by a relaxation of the
17503,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,bonds of kinship. In the lower ranks of society however the kindred
17504,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,has preserved down to the present time perhaps greater vitality
17505,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,among the Servians than in any other European nation. The type of
17506,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,government which we find prevailing in the fourteenth century is far
17507,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"removed from that democratic system which Procopius (_Goth._, III 14)"
17508,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,ascribes to the Slavs some six centuries previously. The governors whom
17509,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,Dušan appointed in various parts of his dominions became practically
17510,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"independent princes after his death, although their principalities"
17511,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,rested apparently on no national basis. Both in Servia proper and
17512,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,elsewhere the control of affairs seems to have been very largely in the
17513,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,hands of the royal family.
17514,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,
17515,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,For the Cumbrian Heroic Age our information is sadly deficient. The
17516,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,evidence of the poems leaves no doubt as to the potency of the force of
17517,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"personal allegiance. With regard to the kindred I know of no evidence,"
17518,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"unless we take account of the Welsh laws, which belong to a different"
17519,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,region and to a period several centuries later. The kingdoms seem to
17520,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"have been fairly numerous, and there is nothing to show that their"
17521,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,organisation differed much from that of Teutonic kingdoms of the Heroic
17522,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,Age. Whether they rested on any national basis we cannot tell; but it
17523,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,is to be noted that practically all their territories had once been
17524,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,included within the Roman frontiers[635].
17525,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,
17526,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,Both these cases then appear to show a number of the features which
17527,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,"characterise the Teutonic and Greek Heroic Ages, though scarcely to"
17528,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,the same degree as is the case with the civilisation of the ancient
17529,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,Gauls. Analogies may also be found in the French and Russian Heroic
17530,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,Ages; but I am not aware that either of these presents any remarkable
17531,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,characteristics which do not occur in one or other of those with which
17532,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,we have dealt. On the other hand I have no doubt that many interesting
17533,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,features are to be found in the Irish Heroic Age (or rather perhaps
17534,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,Heroic Ages[636]). This subject however is beset with such extreme
17535,CELTIC AND SLAVONIC HEROIC AGES.,difficulties of every kind that I dare not touch it.

17578,(I 18).,[635] The rise of the Cumbrian kingdoms presents a difficulty which
17579,(I 18).,historians do not seem to me to have sufficiently realised. During the
17580,(I 18).,fourth and fifth centuries the northern parts of the province were
17581,(I 18).,repeatedly menaced and ravaged by Pictish invaders. Yet after the fifth
17582,(I 18).,century we hear practically nothing more of Picts in the south of
17583,(I 18).,Scotland (except in Galloway). On the other hand it was in this region
17584,(I 18).,that the Britons offered the most determined resistance to the English.
17585,(I 18).,"In the latter part of the sixth century Urien is said (_Hist. Br._, §"
17586,(I 18).,63) to have besieged them on one occasion in Lindisfarne (_Metcaud_);
17587,(I 18).,"and in Strathclyde the Britons maintained their independence, except"
17588,(I 18).,"for one or two brief intervals, until long after the disappearance"
17589,(I 18).,"of the Northumbrian kingdom. It is often assumed, though on somewhat"
17590,(I 18).,"slender grounds, that the Britons held only the south-west of Scotland"
17591,(I 18).,"and that the south-east (Lothian, etc.) was Pictish before the English"
17592,(I 18).,conquest. But this hypothesis does not get rid of the difficulties; for
17593,(I 18).,"it is from _Manau Guotodin_, a district always regarded as Pictish,"
17594,(I 18).,"that Cunedda is said to have come (_ib._, § 62). I suspect that the"
17595,(I 18).,distinction between Picts and Britons was not so rigid as is commonly
17596,(I 18).,supposed. Unfortunately Celtic scholars have not yet been able to come
17597,(I 18).,to any agreement as to the character of the Pictish language. Some hold
17598,(I 18).,"that it was British (Brythonic), others Gaelic (Goidelic), others again"
17599,(I 18).,non-Celtic. Possibly all these views may contain a certain amount of
17600,(I 18).,truth. At all events it seems to me quite incredible that Gaelic was
17601,(I 18).,not introduced into Scotland before the sixth century. All indications
17602,(I 18).,appear to me to favour the view that this language belonged to a wave
17603,(I 18).,of Celtic invasion earlier than the British. Yet I see no objection to
17604,(I 18).,supposing that in pre-Roman times the true (Gaelic) Picts--who probably
17605,(I 18).,included a non-Celtic substratum--may have been overlaid in part by a
17606,(I 18).,"British element. If so, it is far from improbable that the south of"
17607,(I 18).,"Scotland in its turn received a 'Pictish' element, when that district"
17608,(I 18).,was abandoned by the Romans. A mixed population of this kind would
17609,(I 18).,readily enough coalesce with the native (British) inhabitants.
17610,(I 18).,
17611,(I 18).,[636] So also in the Heroic Ages of non-European peoples. Important
17612,(I 18).,parallels are certainly furnished by Sanskrit epic poetry.

17620,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
17621,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
17622,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,In the course of the last three chapters we have observed many
17623,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,remarkable resemblances between the Teutonic and Greek Heroic Ages--in
17624,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"social organisation, in the forms of government and in religious"
17625,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,conceptions. Further we have seen that in the former case the testimony
17626,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,of the poems is fully substantiated by contemporary historical
17627,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,authorities. In the latter case we possess no evidence which affords us
17628,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,ground for doubting that the poems give an equally faithful reflection
17629,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,of conditions and ideas which prevailed in real life. Our next and
17630,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,final object is to enquire into the nature of the causes to which the
17631,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,common characteristics of the two Heroic Ages are due.
17632,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
17633,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,I do not think that any one will seriously suggest the possibility
17634,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"of a historical connection between the two Heroic Ages, separated as"
17635,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,they are from one another by an interval of some fourteen or fifteen
17636,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,centuries. It is perhaps conceivable that one or other of the common
17637,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,elements which we have noted may have originated in Greece and worked
17638,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,its way round until it appears after so long a lapse of time in the
17639,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,north of Europe[637]. But for the phenomena as a whole any such
17640,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,explanation is incredible.
17641,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
17642,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Another explanation is suggested by the fact that the Greek and
17643,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Teutonic peoples are ultimately related, at least linguistically--both"
17644,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,being members of the Indo-European family. It is only reasonable
17645,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,therefore to expect that they may have inherited common
17646,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,characteristics. But this explanation does not in itself account for
17647,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the fact that the Heroic Age begins in one case some fourteen or
17648,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,fifteen centuries after the other. Moreover the Heroic Age of the
17649,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Southern Slavs begins about a thousand years later than that of the
17650,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Teutonic peoples, while we have no evidence that the Lithuanians ever"
17651,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,had a Heroic Age. Yet both of these equally belong to the Indo-European
17652,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,linguistic family.
17653,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
17654,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Again it may be suggested that the causes responsible for the Heroic
17655,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Age are to be found not so much in ethnical affinity as in the
17656,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,possession of a similar stage of culture. The term 'Early Iron Age' is
17657,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,customarily applied to both the Teutonic and Greek Heroic Ages. But
17658,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,this common application of the term is misleading. In the Greek Heroic
17659,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Age the use of iron, at all events for weapons, seems to have been only"
17660,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"beginning, whereas the Teutonic peoples had been using iron weapons for"
17661,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,at least seven or eight centuries before their Heroic Age. Moreover
17662,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,both the Lithuanians and the Southern Slavs have passed through similar
17663,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,stages of culture--in the latter case many centuries before the first
17664,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Servian Heroic Age.
17665,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
17666,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,The suggestions put forward above may doubtless help to account for
17667,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,certain features in both the Teutonic and the Greek Heroic Ages;
17668,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"but it cannot be contended that they are capable, whether singly or"
17669,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"collectively, of explaining the phenomena as a whole. If we are to"
17670,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,obtain a more satisfactory explanation we shall do well in the first
17671,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,place to give our attention to the outstanding characteristics of that
17672,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,period of history which coincides with the Teutonic Heroic Age.
17673,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
17674,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,This period was a momentous time in Teutonic history. In the first
17675,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,place it saw the conversion of most of the Continental peoples to
17676,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Christianity. But probably no one will suggest that the Heroic Age was
17677,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,an outcome of this change. On the other hand the same period witnessed
17678,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the fall of the Western Empire and the occupation of almost all its
17679,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,territories by Teutonic peoples. The effect of these movements must
17680,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"have been enormous, and in them we may reasonably expect to find at"
17681,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,least one of the chief causes of the phenomena which we are discussing.
17682,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"At the same time it is to be remembered that the Vandals and Visigoths,"
17683,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"who penetrated farthest into the empire, do not figure in stories of"
17684,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"the Heroic Age, while even the Franks are less conspicuous than the"
17685,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Danes, who took no part in these movements."
17686,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
17687,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,In the case of the Greek Heroic Age we have unfortunately to depend
17688,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"upon inferences, since no historical evidence is obtainable. Not many"
17689,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"years ago Prof. Ridgeway[638] advanced a very interesting theory, which"
17690,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"has greatly influenced subsequent opinion, at least in this country."
17691,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"This theory, stated briefly, is to the effect that the Achaeans were a"
17692,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,people from Central Europe who had made their way into Greece by way
17693,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"of Epeiros, not very long before the Heroic Age, and conquered the"
17694,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"indigenous inhabitants, whom he calls Pelasgians. In support of this"
17695,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,view he has brought forward a large number of arguments relating to
17696,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"physical characteristics, habits, dress, armour, social organisation,"
17697,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"religion, funeral customs, etc., in which he shows that the affinities"
17698,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,of the Homeric Achaeans lie with the Celtic peoples rather than with
17699,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the earlier inhabitants of Greece.
17700,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
17701,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,It is impossible here to enter into a detailed discussion of Prof.
17702,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Ridgeway's theory. The first objection which may be raised against it
17703,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,lies in the absence of traditional evidence for the great movement
17704,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,of population which it involves--evidence such as we possess for the
17705,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Dorian conquest and the Ionic migration. The force of this objection
17706,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"depends of course a good deal upon what may be called details, e.g. the"
17707,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"date of the invasion, the numerical strength of the invaders and the"
17708,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,method by which the conquest was effected. A more serious objection
17709,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,is perhaps to be found in the conditions postulated by Prof. Ridgeway
17710,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,for Central Europe. Probably few who have given much attention to the
17711,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,subject will be inclined to dispute that the affinities of Homeric
17712,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"civilisation lie in many respects with that of the Celtic peoples,"
17713,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,rather than with the earlier civilisation of the Aegean. But all
17714,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the evidence at our disposal seems to indicate that among the Celtic
17715,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,peoples this type of civilisation belongs to a much later period. There
17716,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,is nothing to show that even at Hallstatt and elsewhere in the Eastern
17717,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Alps the earliest use of iron[639] goes back to the beginning of the
17718,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"first millennium, and it is extremely doubtful whether these deposits"
17719,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,are of Celtic origin[640]. In order to prove that Homeric civilisation
17720,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,came from Central Europe evidence must be adduced showing that the
17721,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,chronology usually accepted by archaeologists is mistaken and that a
17722,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,civilisation of the same type prevailed in that region far back in the
17723,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,second millennium. Until such evidence is forthcoming it appears more
17724,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,probable that both the civilisation of Central and Western Europe and
17725,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the non-Mycenean elements in Homeric civilisation have radiated from a
17726,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"common centre, the true home of which has not yet been discovered."
17727,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
17728,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,These considerations however must not be allowed to obscure the fact
17729,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,that Prof. Ridgeway's observations have thrown light on a number of
17730,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,serious difficulties in early Greek history. In the first place he has
17731,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,rightly insisted upon a recognition of the great differences noticeable
17732,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,between Homeric and Mycenean civilisation--differences which can hardly
17733,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,be accounted for except by some such explanation as that which he has
17734,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,brought forward. It is now admitted by the majority of scholars that
17735,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the Aegean civilisation cannot have originated with the Achaeans; but
17736,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,there is still great difference of opinion as to the nature of its
17737,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,relations with this people. Some hold that the prehistoric civilisation
17738,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"of Crete was non-Achaean--and indeed non-Greek--until its fall, and yet"
17739,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,believe that Mycenae and the other cities of the mainland were always
17740,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Achaean. Others again hold that the later remains both on the mainland
17741,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"and in Crete are Achaean, while the earlier ones, at all events in"
17742,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Crete, were non-Achaean. But neither of these theories accounts for"
17743,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the differences between Mycenean and Homeric civilisation[641]. Both
17744,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,alike involve the assumption that the latter is a reflection of the
17745,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"conditions of a later age--an assumption which, as we have seen, can"
17746,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,scarcely be reconciled with the evidence of the poems on the use of the
17747,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,metals and other matters discussed above.
17748,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
17749,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Secondly, Prof. Ridgeway has pointed out the groundlessness of the"
17750,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,prevalent hypothesis that the Achaeans were the first Greek-speaking
17751,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,inhabitants of Greece. He has rightly insisted on the antiquity of the
17752,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Arcadians and Athenians, together with certain other peoples, Ionians"
17753,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"and Cypriotes, who had emigrated from Greece, and at the same time"
17754,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,called attention to the fact--which is commonly overlooked--that none
17755,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,of these peoples claimed to be of Achaean origin[642]. The Achaean
17756,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"communities of historical times used dialects of the West Greek type,"
17757,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"as distinct from Ionic or Arcadian as they are from Aeolic, and we"
17758,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,have no evidence that they ever spoke a different type of language.
17759,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,On this subject however enough has been said above (p. 281 ff.). The
17760,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"name 'Pelasgian,' which Prof. Ridgeway applies to the earlier Greek"
17761,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"inhabitants, seems to me to be open to objection; yet the evidence of"
17762,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Herodotus can be adduced in its favour.
17763,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
17764,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Thirdly, when Prof. Ridgeway holds that the route by which the"
17765,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Achaeans made their way southwards was through Epeiros he has in
17766,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,his favour an argument of considerable weight in the antiquity and
17767,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"importance of the sanctuary at Dodona, which in historical times lay"
17768,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"on the extreme edge of the Greek world. But, apart from this, the"
17769,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,linguistic geography of Greece is unintelligible to me unless dialects
17770,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,of the Arcadian and Ionic types were once spoken over a much larger
17771,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,area in Greece proper than that in which we find them in historical
17772,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,times. All indications seem to point to the region west of Pindos
17773,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,as the home of that West Greek group to which the Achaean dialects
17774,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,belong[643].
17775,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
17776,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Lastly it must be regarded as improbable that Epeiros was solely
17777,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,responsible for those elements in Homeric or Achaean civilisation
17778,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,which differentiate it from that of the Mycenean age and at the same
17779,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,time connect it with the civilisations of Central and Western Europe.
17780,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,In historical times this country had passed almost entirely into the
17781,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"possession of barbarian peoples owing to pressure from the north,"
17782,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,and we have no reason for supposing that this process was new. It is
17783,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,commonly held that in the period preceding the Heroic Age[644] there
17784,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,had been great movements of population from the Balkan peninsula into
17785,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the north-west of Asia Minor--a process which likewise was repeated
17786,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,in later times. What little evidence we have for the civilisation of
17787,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,these peoples does not suggest any great difference between their
17788,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,civilisation and that of the Homeric Greeks. The Homeric poems in
17789,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,particular seem to draw little or no distinction in this respect
17790,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,between the Achaeans on the one hand and the Trojans and their allies
17791,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"on the other. Hence, whatever may be our attitude to the arguments"
17792,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"based on physical characteristics, etc., on which Prof. Ridgeway lays"
17793,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"so much weight, we cannot, I think, reasonably regard it as improbable"
17794,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,that Epeiros had long been affected by movements from the same quarter.
17795,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Indeed the existence of considerable 'Illyrian' or semi-Illyrian
17796,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"populations in Italy, which certainly date from prehistoric times,"
17797,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"shows that these movements took a south-westerly, as well as a"
17798,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"south-easterly, course. A common centre of disturbance may be found in"
17799,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"the highlands of Albania and Upper Macedonia, though I do not mean to"
17800,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,deny that this area itself may have been affected by movements from
17801,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,more northern regions.
17802,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
17803,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,It may be that in the volumes of his work which have still to appear
17804,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Prof. Ridgeway will be able to bring forward some stronger evidence
17805,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,in favour of the northern origin of the Achaeans. But even with
17806,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the reservations expressed above it will be seen that this theory
17807,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,provides a parallel on a small scale to those historical movements
17808,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,which characterised the Heroic Age of the Teutonic peoples. And some
17809,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"such explanation is certainly required, even apart from the Homeric"
17810,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"poems, in order to account for the archaeological phenomena and the"
17811,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,ethnic and linguistic geography of Greece in the historical period.
17812,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,It is Prof. Ridgeway's great service to have pointed out that the
17813,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,'Homeric question' is only a part of a much greater problem. Towards
17814,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the solution of this problem little progress can be made by hypotheses
17815,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,like those which we have discussed in Chapters XIII and XIV--according
17816,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"to which one hero is derived from a god or 'tribal personification,'"
17817,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,while another is a fictitious character which a credulous public has
17818,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,come to regard as historical. Even in the best of cases it is only the
17819,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,surface of the problem which can be touched by such investigations.
17820,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Prof. Ridgeway has shown that the real problem which lies behind the
17821,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Homeric poems is not, as has been said, the development of Greek heroic"
17822,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,tradition ('die Entwickelung der griechischen Heldensage') but the
17823,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,character and origin of the Greek Heroic Age. This in its turn must
17824,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,be regarded as only one of a series of phenomena which we meet with
17825,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,among various peoples and at various periods of the world's history.
17826,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,In short the real problem presented by the Homeric poems is one not of
17827,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,literature but of anthropology.
17828,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,

17830,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
17831,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,We have seen that the Teutonic Heroic Age was a time of great national
17832,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,movements and that something of the same kind appears to have taken
17833,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,place in or shortly before the Greek Heroic Age. But it is obvious
17834,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,enough that such movements in themselves will not account for the
17835,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,common characteristics of the two Heroic Ages which we have discussed
17836,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,in the last three chapters. In order to obtain an explanation of these
17837,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,phenomena we shall have to take the evidence of other Heroic Ages into
17838,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,consideration.
17839,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
17840,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,In the course of our discussion we have had occasion to refer to four
17841,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"other Heroic Ages, namely those of the Mohammedan and the Christian"
17842,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Servians, the Cumbrian Welsh and the ancient Gauls. Taking account of"
17843,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,these and all other similar cases of which I have any knowledge I am
17844,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,not clear that the essential conditions requisite for a Heroic Age
17845,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,need involve more than may conveniently be summed up in the phrase
17846,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,'Mars and the Muses.' It is to poetry that we owe the preservation
17847,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,of the stories--and indeed much more than this; for wherever we have
17848,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,any evidence as to its character heroic poetry seems to have aimed at
17849,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,something more than a mere record of facts. Indeed there can be little
17850,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,doubt that it exercised a considerable influence upon the spirit of the
17851,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,times.
17852,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
17853,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,The part played by 'Mars' is perhaps not so obvious; for it is
17854,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,clear from Beowulf and the Odyssey that a state of actual war is
17855,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,not a necessary condition either for heroic society or even for the
17856,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,formation of a heroic story. Yet I cannot call to mind a single story
17857,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"in which the hero, i.e. the leading sympathetic character, is not"
17858,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,distinguished for personal bravery; and usually the main action of the
17859,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,story turns upon a situation in which opportunity is given for the
17860,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,display of this quality. It appears to me incredible that the types of
17861,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,character most prominent in all these forms of heroic poetry could have
17862,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,flourished in times of profound international peace and settled social
17863,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,conditions[645]. Indeed I cannot but think that under such conditions
17864,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,most of our heroes would sooner or later have found themselves in
17865,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,prison.
17866,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
17867,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,On the whole warfare is the state of affairs most commonly involved in
17868,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,heroic stories. It is a fact worth noting however that this warfare
17869,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,almost invariably takes the form of hand-to-hand fighting and very
17870,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,frequently that of a series of single combats. The national aspect
17871,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,of war is seldom brought into much prominence. With the Teutonic and
17872,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Greek evidence on this subject we have already dealt (pp. 329 f., 339"
17873,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,ff.); and we may perhaps remark that all the other Heroic Ages ended in
17874,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,periods of failure or even disaster. In the Welsh and Servian Heroic
17875,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Ages the warfare certainly has a religious side; but this aspect is not
17876,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,always so prominent in the poems as one might have expected. We know
17877,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,too from historical sources that Welsh princes often fought in alliance
17878,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,with the heathen English during the first part of the seventh century.
17879,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Similar events were by no means unknown in Servian history. The chief
17880,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"hero of the Southern Slavs, Kraljević Marko, was in alliance with the"
17881,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Turks, if he did not actually fight on their side at the battle of"
17882,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Kossovo.
17883,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
17884,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,The triumphs for which the heroes of heroic poetry hope and for
17885,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,which they are celebrated in the poems are primarily of a personal
17886,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"character and gained by personal prowess, even in times of national"
17887,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,war; and all the stories alike are permeated by the spirit of personal
17888,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,adventure. Sometimes we find this spirit indulged with a reckless
17889,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"disregard of consequences, as when Odysseus seeks out the Cyclops in"
17890,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"his cave[646], or when the Beg Ljubović visits the white city of Zara."
17891,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Not unfrequently of course the object with which such adventures are
17892,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,undertaken is the acquisition of wealth. But wealth itself is desired
17893,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,not so much in order to ensure a life of comfort or even a position
17894,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"of influence, but rather for the sake of display--that the hero may"
17895,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,be able to outshine all his rivals in splendour. Desire of personal
17896,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,glory--often coupled with love of adventure for its own sake--appears
17897,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,to be the leading motive in all the various types of heroic poetry
17898,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,which we have considered.
17899,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
17900,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Now it has often been remarked that the savage is in many respects like
17901,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,a child. We are certainly not justified in describing the people of any
17902,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,of the Heroic Ages treated above as savages; but it would be an equally
17903,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"great error to regard their civilisation, even in the best case,"
17904,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,as mature. And in this respect I cannot help thinking that modern
17905,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,historians have tended to fall into a mistake similar to that which has
17906,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,sometimes been made by European governors of savage or semi-civilised
17907,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,communities. It is a mistake for which our historical authorities
17908,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,themselves are doubtless partly responsible; for we need not suppose
17909,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"that Greeks or Romans of the past, whether scholars or statesmen,"
17910,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,were better able to understand the motives of heroic societies than
17911,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,are similar persons in our own days. The qualities exhibited by these
17912,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"societies, virtues and defects alike, are clearly those of adolescence."
17913,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Further, we may note in this connection that the evidence of history"
17914,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,gives us no ground for supposing that the 'heroic' spirit is an innate
17915,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,and permanent characteristic of certain peoples. It may be possible to
17916,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,point to communities in which the Heroic Age has persisted for many
17917,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"centuries, just as numerous peoples in different parts of the world"
17918,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,have remained in a state of 'infancy' or savagery down to the present
17919,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,time. In Europe however the Heroic Age has been a transient phase.
17920,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"The sequel has sometimes been disastrous, sometimes comparatively"
17921,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,prosperous; but in every case the ideas which animated the Heroic Age
17922,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,have ceased to retain their hold.
17923,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
17924,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Thus far we have been seeking to find characteristics common to
17925,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,various Heroic Ages. It will be convenient here to refer briefly to
17926,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the conclusions at which we arrived in the last three chapters. We saw
17927,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,(p. 365) that in regard to social organisation the outstanding feature
17928,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,both of the Teutonic and Greek Heroic Ages was the weakening of the
17929,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,ties of kindred and the growth of the bond of allegiance. In political
17930,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,organisation (p. 390 f.) the chief feature of both periods was the
17931,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,development of an irresponsible type of kingship resting upon military
17932,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"prestige, the formation of kingdoms with no national basis and the"
17933,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,growth of relations between one kingdom and another. In religion (p.
17934,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,425) the predominant characteristic in both cases was the subordination
17935,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,of chthonic and tribal cults to the worship of a number of universally
17936,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"recognised and highly anthropomorphic deities, together with the belief"
17937,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"in a common and distant land of souls. Lastly, we observed (in Note"
17938,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,VIII) that the Gaulish Heroic Age appears to have possessed almost all
17939,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"the same characteristics, while in regard to social and political"
17940,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,organisation analogies are also to be found in the Heroic Ages of the
17941,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Cumbrian Welsh and the Christian Servians, though hardly--or only to a"
17942,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,very slight extent--in that of the Mohammedan Servians.
17943,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
17944,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Now it deserves to be remarked that these characteristics are in no
17945,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,sense primitive. In social organisation the distinguishing feature
17946,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,of the Heroic Age is in the nature of a revolt or emancipation from
17947,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,those tribal obligations and ideas by which the society of primitive
17948,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,peoples is everywhere governed. The same remark applies in principle to
17949,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,political organisation; the princes of the Heroic Age appear to have
17950,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,freed themselves to a large extent from any public control on the part
17951,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,of the tribe or community. The changes which we have noted in religion
17952,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,have a similar tendency. Tribal ideas give way to universalism both
17953,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,in the cult of higher powers and in the conception of immortality;
17954,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,and in both the Teutonic and Greek Heroic Ages these changes seem
17955,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,to be associated with a weakening in the force of religion. Briefly
17956,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"expressed, the characteristic feature of both periods is emancipation,"
17957,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"social, political and religious, from the bonds of tribal law."
17958,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
17959,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,It will be seen that the emancipation of which we are speaking is
17960,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,partly of an intellectual character. This applies both to religion and
17961,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,to those ideas which govern social relations. On the other hand it is
17962,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"also partly in the nature of a freedom from outside control, both in"
17963,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,social relations and in government. The force formerly exercised by
17964,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"the kindred is now largely transferred to the comitatus, a body of"
17965,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,chosen adherents pledged to personal loyalty to their chief. So also in
17966,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,government the council of the tribe or community has come to be nothing
17967,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,more than a comitatus or court. The result of the change is that the
17968,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,man who possesses a comitatus becomes largely free from the control
17969,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"of his kindred, while the chief similarly becomes free from control"
17970,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,within his community. In both cases the only opposition that he now has
17971,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,to fear is from rivals who desire to take his place or from persons
17972,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,outside the kindred or community and in a similar position to himself.
17973,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Certainly this freedom applies only to the case of kings or princes
17974,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,with followings of their own. But there is no reason for supposing that
17975,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,intellectual emancipation made much headway except among such persons
17976,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,and their entourages.
17977,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
17978,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,We have seen above that the characteristics of Heroic Ages in
17979,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,general are those neither of infancy nor of maturity--that the
17980,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,typical man of the Heroic Age is to be compared rather with a youth.
17981,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,The characteristics which we are now discussing are by no means
17982,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"inconsistent with such a view, though clearly they will not hold good"
17983,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,for adolescence in general. For a true analogy we must turn to the
17984,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,case of a youth who has outgrown both the ideas and the control of his
17985,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,parents--such a case as may be found among the sons of unsophisticated
17986,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"parents, who through outside influence, at school or elsewhere, have"
17987,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,acquired knowledge which places them in a position of superiority to
17988,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,their surroundings.
17989,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
17990,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,If we examine the history of the Teutonic Heroic Age we shall see that
17991,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,this analogy holds good both for individual princes and for the class
17992,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,as a whole. From the first century to the fifth--we may take the cases
17993,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,of Italicus the son of Flavus and of Theodric the Ostrogoth--it was
17994,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,customary for the Romans to demand the youthful sons of Teutonic kings
17995,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,as hostages. That the accession of such persons to power in later life
17996,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,would open up a channel for the introduction of foreign ideas needs
17997,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,probably no demonstration. But this was doubtless only one of a number
17998,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,of such channels. There is scarcely a single considerable deposit of
17999,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"antiquities dating from the first four centuries, not only in the south"
18000,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"and west of Germany but even in Denmark and other Baltic lands, which"
18001,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,does not contain a large proportion of Roman[647] articles. Among such
18002,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"articles we may mention coins, works of art (glass vases, statuettes,"
18003,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"etc.) and, perhaps above all, armour and weapons. We may refer in"
18004,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,particular to the Roman helmets and the large number of Roman swords
18005,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,and shield-bosses found in deposits on the east side of the province
18006,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,of Slesvig--a district remote from the Roman frontiers. The linguistic
18007,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,evidence too is in full agreement with that of the antiquities. Of
18008,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the immense number of Latin loan-words which found their way into the
18009,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Teutonic languages it is probable that quite a considerable proportion
18010,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,were borrowed in or before the Heroic Age.
18011,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
18012,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Among the various channels through which Roman goods and Roman
18013,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"influence found entry into the Teutonic world we may mention trade,"
18014,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"presents and subsidies, and booty gained by wars and piratical raids."
18015,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,But the most potent influence of all perhaps was the Roman practice
18016,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,of employing Teutonic mercenary soldiers--of which we hear both from
18017,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,inscriptions and literary works. This practice had begun as early as
18018,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"the first century, and it is noteworthy that those German princes who"
18019,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"gave the Romans most trouble, such as Arminius and Civilis, were men"
18020,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,who had previously served with their own armies. In the early part
18021,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,of the Heroic Age it appears that a very considerable proportion not
18022,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,only of the troops but also of the generals in the imperial service
18023,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,were of Teutonic nationality. Such forces were contributed largely by
18024,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"communities which had settled within the boundaries of the empire,"
18025,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,such as the Goths and Vandals in the basin of the Danube and those
18026,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,smaller communities that we hear of incidentally in the east of Gaul.
18027,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,But it was by no means only from these dependent or semi-dependent
18028,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,principalities that the auxiliary troops were drawn. In the reigns
18029,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,of Constantius and Valentinian I the Roman army in Britain contained
18030,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,troops of Heruli--a nation which probably occupied the basin of the
18031,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Elbe and had never been under Roman sovereignty, although a portion of"
18032,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,it submitted to Justinian long afterwards. We have reason for believing
18033,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,that in the sixth century persons from the farthest parts of the
18034,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Teutonic world were fighting in Italy. Otherwise it is difficult to
18035,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,account for the knowledge of Norway and Sweden shown by both Jordanes
18036,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,and Procopius.
18037,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
18038,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,It would be a mistake no doubt to suppose that the comitatus owes its
18039,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,origin to this mercenary service. The evidence for its existence goes
18040,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"back so far that a Gaulish derivation would be more probable, if it is"
18041,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,not of native origin. But there can scarcely be any question that this
18042,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,form of service tended to promote its development. Here too we find a
18043,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,satisfactory explanation of other phenomena noticeable in the Heroic
18044,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Age, in particular of that military type of kingship which rests on no"
18045,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"national basis. Further, it needs no demonstration that such service"
18046,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,would contribute very largely to sweep away tribal prejudices and
18047,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,national patriotism.
18048,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
18049,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,On the whole then the conclusion to which we are brought is that the
18050,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,characteristics of the Heroic Age owe their origin not so much to
18051,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the national movements which brought about the destruction of the
18052,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Western Empire as to the long-standing relations between the two
18053,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"peoples, and perhaps more especially to the influence exercised by"
18054,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,mercenary service. Now we obtain a more satisfactory explanation of
18055,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the effects produced on the more northern peoples. It is by no means
18056,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"improbable that warriors even from Denmark fought in the Roman armies,"
18057,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"while others again may have entered the service of Eormenric, Attila"
18058,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"or Theodric. At all events we can hardly doubt that, directly or"
18059,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"indirectly, the northern peoples were affected to no small degree by"
18060,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the influence of Roman civilisation and the Roman army.
18061,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
18062,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,I do not suppose that anyone will be inclined to question the influence
18063,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,of the same civilisation upon the Welsh Heroic Age. The greater part
18064,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"of Britain had been under the Romans for more than three centuries,"
18065,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,though some considerable time elapsed between their retirement and
18066,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the beginning of the Heroic Age. But it is to be noted that the
18067,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,characters who figure in heroic poetry belong partly to the west but
18068,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"chiefly to the north, i.e. to those parts of the country which had"
18069,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,been less Romanised than the rest. Moreover Welsh tradition traced
18070,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the ancestry of the most important western families to a certain
18071,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Cunedda who, according to a statement in the Historia Brittonum which"
18072,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"most historians seem disposed to accept, had come from a region in"
18073,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the north beyond the Wall about--or very shortly before--the time
18074,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,when the Romans evacuated Britain. The chief northern families also
18075,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"belonged, at least mainly, to districts which appear to have been"
18076,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"abandoned by the Romans early in the third century, and which had"
18077,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"probably never been effectively occupied. Dumbarton, their principal"
18078,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"stronghold, lay far from the frontier of the later province--indeed"
18079,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,on the extreme edge of the earlier frontier. All the evidence at our
18080,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,disposal therefore indicates that the Heroic Age was not a product of
18081,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the Romanised part of Britain but of those communities which remained
18082,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"more or less independent, more especially in the region beyond the"
18083,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,northern frontier. At the same time it cannot be denied that even these
18084,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,districts must have been greatly affected by Roman influence--probably
18085,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,in much the same way and to at least the same degree as the Teutonic
18086,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,peoples adjacent to the Roman frontiers on the Continent. There is
18087,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,little doubt too that the inhabitants of these districts served as
18088,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,mercenary soldiers[648]. The conditions then appear to have been very
18089,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,similar to those of the Teutonic Heroic Age. First we find Roman
18090,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"influence, doubtless both civil and military, affecting the communities"
18091,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"beyond the frontier. Then, on the fall of the Roman power, these"
18092,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"communities, or rather their princes, step in and take possession of"
18093,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,part of the province. The chief difference between the two cases is
18094,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,that here the new rulers were of the same nationality and spoke the
18095,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,same language as the previous inhabitants.
18096,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
18097,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,The origin of the earlier Servian Heroic Age presents in some
18098,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,respects rather an interesting parallel to the case we have just
18099,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,been considering. Like the northern Britons the Servians occupied
18100,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,territories which had formerly been within the frontiers of the Roman
18101,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Empire. Their possession of these territories was recognised by the
18102,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,emperor Heraclius (610-640) not long after their settlement; and from
18103,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,this time onwards they were governed by a number of petty princes of
18104,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"their own in a state of semi-dependence, often merely nominal, on the"
18105,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Greek Empire for about six centuries. During the whole of this period,"
18106,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"except perhaps for a few short intervals, when they were subject to the"
18107,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Bulgarians, they were constantly exposed to the influence of Greek"
18108,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,civilisation. It is probable too that they were frequently employed in
18109,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"war by the Greek emperors, first against the Avars and later against"
18110,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"the Magyars. On the death of Manuel I (1180), when the Empire rapidly"
18111,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"went to ruin, Stefan Nemanja united the various principalities and"
18112,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,formed a powerful Servian state. His work was continued and extended
18113,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"by several of his successors, especially by Uroš I (1242-1276) and"
18114,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Dušan (1331-1356), the latter of whom brought nearly the whole of"
18115,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"the Balkan peninsula under his rule. Here again therefore, as in the"
18116,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Teutonic and Cumbrian Heroic Ages, we have the case of a semi-civilised"
18117,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,and 'juvenile' nation exposed for a long period to the influence of a
18118,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"civilised but decaying empire. Again too, when the older power gives"
18119,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"way, the younger nation asserts itself and takes possession of its"
18120,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,neighbour's territories. In this respect however the affinities of the
18121,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Servian state are rather with the kingdoms of the Ostrogoths in Italy
18122,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,or the Franks in Gaul than with the Cumbrian Welsh; for the latter
18123,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,apparently never succeeded in establishing a united state--at least not
18124,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,until their territories had been greatly diminished.
18125,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
18126,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,The history of the later Servian (Bosnian) Heroic Age was of a very
18127,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"different kind. After the Turkish conquest (1459 in Servia proper,"
18128,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,somewhat later in the west) a large proportion of the inhabitants
18129,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,embraced Islam. From this time onwards their condition was somewhat
18130,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"comparable with that of their ancestors under the Greeks, though they"
18131,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,were in much closer subjection to the suzerain power than the latter
18132,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"had ever been. Moreover, though they enjoyed a certain amount of"
18133,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,prosperity during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries when the
18134,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Turkish empire was at the height of its power, they never again formed"
18135,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,an independent state. There can be no question that during the whole of
18136,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"this period the Mohammedan Servians were exposed to foreign influence,"
18137,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,probably to a greater extent than any of the cases with which we have
18138,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,dealt above. But this influence was of a very different character from
18139,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"the others and little calculated to produce emancipation, whether"
18140,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,intellectual or otherwise. In estimating the value of the resemblances
18141,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,which their heroic poetry shows to the types discussed above account
18142,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,must be taken of the consideration that much has doubtless been
18143,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,inherited--not merely in metre and phraseology--from that of the
18144,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,earlier period.
18145,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
18146,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,In dealing with the Gauls we are placed at a disadvantage through not
18147,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,knowing when the Heroic Age began. But all that we do know of their
18148,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,early history bears a most striking resemblance to the Heroic Age of
18149,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the Teutonic peoples. Our first trustworthy references to the Gauls
18150,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"(Κελτοί) go back to the fifth century, at which time they appear to"
18151,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,have occupied France and some parts at least of western Germany. It is
18152,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,commonly held also that they had already penetrated into Spain; and
18153,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,there can be no doubt that by this time a considerable part of the
18154,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,British Isles was in the possession of Celtic peoples. By the beginning
18155,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"of the fourth century, if not earlier, they had effected settlements"
18156,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"in the plain of northern Italy, from whence military expeditions"
18157,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,frequently made their way far into the peninsula. In the latter part of
18158,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"the same century we hear of Gauls in the Eastern Alps, probably in the"
18159,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,basin of the Danube. Early in the following century Gaulish armies were
18160,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,making expeditions throughout the greater part of the Balkan peninsula
18161,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"and even into Greece, while one force effected a settlement in Asia"
18162,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Minor.
18163,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
18164,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,There is no evidence that any civilised power had acquired even a
18165,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,nominal authority over the Gauls before their subjugation by the
18166,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Romans. But it is quite clear that for many centuries they had felt
18167,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"the influence of the Etruscan and Greek civilisations, more especially"
18168,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"the former. Linguistic evidence is not available here, since we know"
18169,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,nothing of the Etruscan language and little of the Gaulish. But the
18170,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,fact is placed beyond doubt by the large variety of articles of
18171,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Etruscan origin or Etruscan types, which have been found throughout"
18172,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the territories of the Gauls and even in more northern regions. The
18173,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,evidence seems to indicate that the influence of this civilisation was
18174,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,comparable with that exercised in later times by Roman civilisation
18175,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,on the Teutonic peoples. Unfortunately however we have no historical
18176,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,record of those movements which first brought the Gauls into southern
18177,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Europe. All that can be said with certainty is that in the earliest
18178,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,times for which we have trustworthy evidence they appear usually as
18179,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,auxiliaries or mercenaries in the service of the Etruscans. Sometimes
18180,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"also they were employed by the Greeks, Carthaginians and Samnites."
18181,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,And it was not only the Gauls settled in Italy who were used in this
18182,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"way. Occasionally we hear also of Transalpine Gauls or 'Gaisatoi,'"
18183,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,who came to their assistance. Polybius (II 22) states that the latter
18184,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,name means 'mercenaries' (διὰ τὸ μισθοῦ στρατεύειν); and even if
18185,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"his interpretation is incorrect, it is significant enough of the"
18186,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,opinion generally entertained as to the character of these warriors.
18187,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Evidence to the same effect is afforded by the consideration that in
18188,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the fourth and third centuries at least half of Europe (exclusive of
18189,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Russia) appears to have been under Celtic rule, while some five or six"
18190,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,centuries later Celtic nationality had vanished almost everywhere. Such
18191,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,phenomena are scarcely explicable unless the Celtic conquests were
18192,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"largely in the nature of military occupations, like those of the Goths,"
18193,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Visigoths and Vandals in later times.
18194,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
18195,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,We have left the Greek Heroic Age until the end because in this case
18196,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,historical information is wanting. Here also it is clear that a high
18197,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,civilisation had existed in a portion of the area then occupied by
18198,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the Achaeans; and there can be no doubt that the latter were deeply
18199,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,affected thereby. The difficulty lies in determining the relationship
18200,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,of the Achaeans to this civilisation. Prof. Ridgeway's theory on the
18201,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,question has already been discussed. At the same time however it was
18202,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,mentioned that there are other scholars who hold that the Achaeans
18203,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,themselves were partly responsible for this civilisation. Some believe
18204,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,that the prehistoric civilisation of Crete was non-Achaean until
18205,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"its fall, and yet claim an Achaean origin for the fortresses on the"
18206,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"mainland (Mycenae, Tiryns, etc.)[649], while others attribute to the"
18207,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Achaeans not only the buildings on the mainland but also the later
18208,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,palaces in Crete[650]. It is recognised by the advocates of this latter
18209,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,view that a different type of civilisation appears in other--more
18210,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,western--districts which have at least as good a claim to be regarded
18211,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,as Achaean lands. The explanation given is that the more primitive
18212,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,pottery and less elaborate buildings of these districts are true
18213,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"products of Achaean art and handicraft, while the remains found at"
18214,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Mycenae and elsewhere are due to native, or rather Cretan, craftsmen"
18215,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"and builders, who worked for Achaean lords."
18216,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
18217,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Both these explanations are open, as we have seen, to the serious"
18218,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,objection that they fail to account for the differences between Homeric
18219,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,and Mycenean (Late Minoan) civilisation. It has been observed that in
18220,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,regard to armature the affinities of the former lie apparently rather
18221,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"with the Warrior Vase (cf. p. 185), which belongs to a later period"
18222,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,than the true Mycenean age. All indications favour the view that this
18223,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,type of armature is derived from that of the Shardina rather than
18224,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"from earlier Mycenean or Cretan types. Again, I do not see that the"
18225,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,presence of vases of 'Late Minoan II' style in the tombs found at
18226,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Kakovatos--which is identified with the Homeric Pylos--can fairly be
18227,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"held to prove that these tombs date from that period[651]; for, when"
18228,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the manufacture of such vases had ceased they may very well have been
18229,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,preserved as precious heirlooms for a considerable time. Nor can it be
18230,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"said with certainty that these tombs date from the Achaean period[652],"
18231,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,or at all events from the last days of it[653]. The evidence of the
18232,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,pottery[654] found in the ruins of the citadel seems rather to suggest
18233,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,that this site was inhabited at a later date than the tombs[655].
18234,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
18235,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,In the Homeric poems we certainly find the Achaeans in possession of
18236,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the chief centres of the prehistoric civilisation both in Crete and on
18237,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the mainland. Mycenae itself is represented as the principal seat of
18238,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the most important of the Achaean dynasties. But the poems themselves
18239,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,do not tell us by whom these places had been founded--though the origin
18240,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,of Troy does seem to be known. If we are right in believing that only
18241,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the stratum represented by the Warrior Vase and the Stele corresponds
18242,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"truly to the conditions depicted in the poems, it is a probable"
18243,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,inference that the Achaeans came into possession of Mycenae at a very
18244,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,late period in its history. In that case the presence of Agamemnon in
18245,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,this city would be a phenomenon somewhat parallel to that of Theodric
18246,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"(Dietrich von Bern) in Ravenna. In later times, it is true, we meet"
18247,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,with stories according to which Tiryns and Mycenae were founded by
18248,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Proitos and Perseus, though it is not made clear whether these persons"
18249,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,were regarded as Achaeans. But have we any reason for believing that
18250,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,such stories are more trustworthy than the medieval traditions which
18251,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,attribute the foundation of famous Roman buildings to Dietrich von
18252,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Bern? In view of the parallel cases, both Teutonic and other, which we"
18253,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"have discussed in earlier chapters, it seems to me a highly improbable"
18254,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,hypothesis that the men of the Greek Heroic Age had long been in
18255,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,possession of an advanced civilisation--still more that they had
18256,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,themselves initiated the construction of great palace-fortresses such
18257,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,as those of Tiryns and Mycenae.
18258,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
18259,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,The problem which we are considering has been complicated by the
18260,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,prevalent assumption that the Achaeans were the first Greek-speaking
18261,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,inhabitants of the land--an assumption which seems to me to be
18262,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,incompatible with the evidence of linguistic geography. The objections
18263,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,noted above to the Achaean origin of Mycenean civilisation would not
18264,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,apply with the same force to the hypothesis that this civilisation had
18265,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"been taken over from an earlier branch of the Greek race, represented"
18266,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,perhaps in later times by the Arcadians and Ionians. For such an
18267,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,explanation a certain parallel might be found in the occupation of the
18268,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,(Roman) cities in Britain by British chiefs from the north and west
18269,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"(cf. p. 446 f.). But in this case, if we wish to press the analogy,"
18270,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,we must bear in mind that the civilisation of the British cities was
18271,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,not of native origin but superimposed on the country by invaders from
18272,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,overseas. It is by no means impossible that such may have been the
18273,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,case also in Greece. Yet on the whole the complete break between the
18274,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,prehistoric civilisation and that of historical times must be regarded
18275,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,as an argument--not conclusive of course but weighty--against any
18276,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,form of the theory that the possessors of the former were of Greek
18277,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,nationality.
18278,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
18279,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,It may be convenient now to recapitulate briefly the various points
18280,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,at issue. In the first place account must be taken of the undoubted
18281,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"existence of the prehistoric civilisation, regarding the character of"
18282,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"which evidence is still gradually accumulating. Further, it is scarcely"
18283,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,open to question that the Achaeans were brought into contact with
18284,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"that civilisation in some form or other, though almost all scholars"
18285,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,are agreed that it did not originate with them. The chief questions
18286,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,which remain to be settled are (i) whether the civilisation was
18287,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"native or introduced from abroad (Crete or elsewhere), (ii) whether"
18288,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"its possessors were Greeks or non-Greeks, (iii) whether its monuments"
18289,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,were constructed under Achaean domination or before the centres of
18290,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,civilisation fell into Achaean hands. The first of these questions can
18291,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"only be settled by a thorough examination of the various sites, such"
18292,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,as is now being conducted[656]. All that can be said as yet is that
18293,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the buildings in several cases show work belonging to more than one
18294,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,period. It is now believed that the earlier parts of the fortresses
18295,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,at Tiryns and Mycenae go back at least to the beginning of 'Late
18296,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Minoan' times, i.e. probably to the sixteenth century. On the second"
18297,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,question something has been said above. But until further evidence is
18298,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,forthcoming a dogmatic expression of opinion would be out of place.
18299,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,With regard to the third it appears to me that such evidence as we
18300,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"have favours Prof. Ridgeway's view, viz. that the Achaeans came into"
18301,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,contact with this civilisation only at its fall. In that case moreover
18302,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the Greek Heroic Age will fall into line with all the other Heroic Ages
18303,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,which we have discussed above.
18304,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
18305,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Lastly, it seems to me of essential importance that the relationship"
18306,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"of the Achaeans to the 'sea-peoples,' more especially the Shardina,"
18307,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,should not be overlooked. We cannot with certainty determine whether
18308,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,or not the Achaeans were actually descended from the Shardina. But the
18309,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,resemblance between the two in regard to armature scarcely leaves room
18310,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,for doubt that the one had at least come greatly under the influence
18311,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"of the other. Consequently, whatever may be thought as to the proposed"
18312,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"identification of the Akaiuasha (cf. p. 188 f.), it is highly probable"
18313,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,that the ancestors of the Achaeans had once been associated with the
18314,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,'sea-peoples[657].'
18315,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
18316,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"We have seen that among the Teutonic peoples, as also among the Gauls"
18317,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"and elsewhere, mercenary service was a factor of supreme importance"
18318,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,in the development of those features which give to the Heroic Age
18319,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,its distinctive character. Now it is as mercenary soldiers that the
18320,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,'sea-peoples' come before our notice from the time when they are first
18321,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,mentioned down to their disappearance. We know from the Tell-el-Amarna
18322,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,tablets that Shardina had entered the Egyptian service in the reign
18323,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"of Amenhotep IV or his predecessor, i.e. in the first half of the"
18324,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,fourteenth century. Later we find them fighting under both Rameses
18325,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,II and Rameses III. The references therefore extend over a period of
18326,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,nearly two centuries. Nor was it only to the Egyptians that they lent
18327,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,their services. The army of the Hittites encountered by Rameses II at
18328,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Kadesh is said to have contained Shardina, and warriors of the same"
18329,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,stock were present in the Libyan army defeated by Merenptah.
18330,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
18331,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,With the Shardina we usually find a number of other peoples
18332,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,associated[658]; and there is no reason for doubting that these were
18333,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,employed in the same way. Reference may be made to the description
18334,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"of the allies of the Hittites in the Poem of Pentaur, where this is"
18335,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,expressed quite clearly[659]. The Pulesatha also represented on the
18336,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,monuments of Rameses III are evidently well-disciplined professional
18337,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,soldiers.
18338,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
18339,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"There can be no question then that professional military service, very"
18340,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"frequently in the employment of foreign nations, was the vocation of"
18341,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,those bands of warriors whom we have to regard as the predecessors
18342,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,of the Achaeans of the Heroic Age. But we can scarcely suppose that
18343,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,this mercenary service first began in regions so distant as Egypt. It
18344,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,has been mentioned above that the earliest reference to Shardina in
18345,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the Egyptian service goes back to a time when the Cretan palaces were
18346,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"probably still standing (cf. p. 184). If so and if, as is commonly"
18347,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"believed, the absence of fortifications in Crete was due to the"
18348,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"possession of a thalassocracy by its rulers, we must conclude that"
18349,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,these rulers permitted the early expeditions of the 'sea-peoples.'
18350,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,That can scarcely mean anything else than that the Shardina and their
18351,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,confederates were first employed as mercenaries by the Cretans
18352,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,themselves[660]. In that case the relations of these peoples with the
18353,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,civilised states of the Aegean were in all probability very similar to
18354,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,those of the Teutonic peoples with Rome before and after the fall of
18355,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the Western Empire.
18356,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
18357,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,The ultimate origin of the Shardina and their confederates is
18358,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,a question which as yet can hardly be regarded as ripe for
18359,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,discussion[661]. Later discoveries may show that they were the
18360,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,inhabitants of the western or northern parts of Greece; or on the other
18361,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,hand they may confirm the view that these peoples had come in part from
18362,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the western Mediterranean. All that can be said at present is that some
18363,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,of these peoples--the Pulesatha type--appear to have long been settled
18364,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,in the Aegean area[662] and that the resemblances and differences
18365,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,between these and the Shardina are of such a kind as to suggest that
18366,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"the two were peoples racially distinct[663], yet living in adjacent"
18367,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"regions and following a similar mode of life, at least so far as the"
18368,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,military element is concerned. On the whole the balance of probability
18369,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,seems at present to be in favour of the following propositions: (1)
18370,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,that the Shardina element was intrusive; (2) that its true home is
18371,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,to be looked for rather in the north than in the west[664]; (3) that
18372,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,its presence or influence in the Greek world is not unconnected with
18373,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,that series of national movements which introduced Thraco-Phrygian
18374,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,populations into Asia Minor[665].
18375,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
18376,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,It is by no means impossible that the Shardina were the direct
18377,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,ancestors of the Achaeans. On the other hand they may have belonged
18378,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,to an earlier wave of Greek invasion. Or again they may have been
18379,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,a non-Greek (perhaps Thraco-Phrygian) people whose relations with
18380,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"the Achaeans were rather in the nature of influence, however deeply"
18381,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,this may have penetrated. That the Achaeans also were an essentially
18382,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,military people is shown by the tone of Homeric poetry throughout and
18383,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"by the story of the Iliad as a whole, as well as by many incidental"
18384,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,passages in the Odyssey. We have good reason too for believing that
18385,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,their occupation was in the nature of a military rather than a tribal
18386,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,settlement. That is shown not only by the social and political
18387,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,conditions reflected in the Homeric poems[666] but also by the
18388,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"fact that, except in two comparatively unimportant districts, they"
18389,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,disappeared after the Heroic Age as completely as the Ostrogoths.
18390,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,

18392,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
18393,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,The course of our investigations has led us to conclude that there is
18394,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,no reason for regarding the Greek Heroic Age as an exception to the
18395,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,general rule applying to such phenomena. Neither here nor in any other
18396,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,case are we justified in believing that the Heroic Age was a native
18397,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,outgrowth from an ancient and highly developed civilisation. It does
18398,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"not appear that a Heroic Age can arise from such conditions, any more"
18399,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,than from conditions which may properly be called primitive. In four of
18400,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the six cases which we have considered--and we need scarcely hesitate
18401,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,to reckon the Greek case as a fifth--the Heroic Age can be traced
18402,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"back to a similar series of causes. Firstly, we find a long period"
18403,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"of 'education,' in which a semi-civilised people has been profoundly"
18404,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,affected from without by the influence of a civilised people. Then a
18405,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,time has come in which the semi-civilised people has attained to a
18406,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"dominant position and possessed itself, at least to some extent, of"
18407,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,its neighbour's property. The phenomena which we have recognised as
18408,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,characteristic of the Heroic Age appear to be the effects produced upon
18409,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the semi-civilised people by these conditions.
18410,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
18411,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,For the exceptional case--that of the Mohammedan Servians--a special
18412,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,explanation has been suggested. Whether this explanation be correct
18413,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"or not, I do not mean to assert that the Heroic Age is universally"
18414,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,due to the same conditions. They can scarcely hold good for the Irish
18415,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Heroic Age; and outside Europe also there are cases, e.g. among the"
18416,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Bantu peoples, of societies which may be called 'heroic' and yet would"
18417,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,probably require a different explanation. All such cases doubtless
18418,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,postulate conditions so far advanced as to permit the existence of
18419,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,a class of persons who have the opportunity and the ambition to
18420,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,assert their individuality among and above their compatriots. To deal
18421,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,adequately with these cases however would require a greater amount of
18422,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,ethnological knowledge than I possess. I have ventured above to suggest
18423,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,that 'Mars and the Muses' are necessary for the formation of a Heroic
18424,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Age. But beyond this I will not attempt to formulate a definition of
18425,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the elements which constitute a Heroic Age in general. My object has
18426,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,been to call attention to certain common characteristics exhibited by a
18427,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,limited number of epochs in European history.
18428,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
18429,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,The various Heroic Ages of Europe are usually connected with
18430,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,considerable movements of population. There is some reason for
18431,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,suspecting that this may be true even of the Irish Heroic Age. But such
18432,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,movements do not necessarily produce a Heroic Age. We have no evidence
18433,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,for the existence of a Heroic Age resulting from the great movement
18434,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,of the Slavs into eastern Germany during the fifth and following
18435,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,centuries[667]. Presumably the antecedent conditions were wanting.
18436,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,So also with the Dorians. It was only the wreckage of the old Aegean
18437,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,civilisation with which they were brought into contact. The days of
18438,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"mercenary service too, with all its civilising and at the same time"
18439,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"denationalising influence, had apparently passed away long before they"
18440,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,came to the front.
18441,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
18442,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,The general direction taken by these movements--though here the Irish
18443,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,case is an exception--was towards the culture lands of the south--i.e.
18444,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the direction taken by movements of population was the opposite of
18445,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,that taken by movements of culture. The effect of the movements which
18446,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,took place in the Teutonic Heroic Age was to produce a series of
18447,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,inclined or tilted strata of population over a large part of Europe.
18448,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Thus the Franks formed a ruling aristocracy in Gaul; but the subjects
18449,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"(_coloni_, _lati_) of the Old Saxons were in all probability largely of"
18450,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Frankish blood. Again, the Vandals in Africa were the wealthiest and"

18452,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,time (cf. p. 369) there still remained a Vandal population in the old
18453,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"home of the nation, of which all traces had disappeared within the"
18454,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,next century. Presumably they had been overwhelmed by the surrounding
18455,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,peoples. Similar phenomena are to be found among the Goths and other
18456,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"Teutonic peoples, and in earlier times among the Gauls and Greeks. In"
18457,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the latter case we may cite as an instance the Cynurioi (on the east
18458,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"coast of the Peloponnesos), who were believed to be Ionians, though"
18459,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,they had been absorbed by the Dorians of Argos. The fact therefore that
18460,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,we hear of no people called Achaeans in Epeiros cannot be held to prove
18461,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,that the Achaeans had never inhabited that region.
18462,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
18463,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,We hear sometimes from legends of national migrations caused by
18464,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,insufficiency of food. Historical records seem to show that such
18465,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,movements were more frequently due to pressure from neighbouring
18466,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,peoples. But it is greatly to be doubted whether these movements
18467,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,usually involved a total displacement of population. Cases like that
18468,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,of the Vandals indeed indicate that frequently the more enterprising
18469,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,part of the community were the first to move and that the chief impulse
18470,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,came from the attractions offered by the chance of living upon the
18471,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"fruits of others' labour, whether in the form of plunder or tribute."
18472,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"So far as our records go back, we find among the Teutonic peoples, as"
18473,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"among the Gauls and the early Greeks, a numerous class who prefer the"
18474,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,military life to the labour involved in agriculture. Indeed one of the
18475,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,most remarkable features of the Teutonic Heroic Age--and probably of
18476,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the Gaulish also[669]--is the ease with which immense hosts of warriors
18477,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,could be gathered for an enterprise of plunder or conquest. It is
18478,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,certain that these hosts were frequently drawn from far and wide. If
18479,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the national kings would not embark on such enterprises their subjects
18480,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"were ready to embrace the service of neighbouring princes, or even that"
18481,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"of distant or alien nations, such as the Romans. It is the existence of"
18482,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,this military element which in various epochs of European history and
18483,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,under similar cultural conditions has produced the phenomena comprised
18484,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,under the term 'Heroic Age.' For the special characteristics however to
18485,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,which we have called attention above--emancipation from primitive ideas
18486,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,and absence of national feeling--the explanation is to be found in
18487,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"contact with civilised communities, especially in the form of mercenary"
18488,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,service. The military life further had the effect of making the kings
18489,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,regard themselves primarily as commanders of armies. It was for their
18490,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,warriors that consideration was required rather than for the tillers of
18491,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"the soil, who were largely of alien nationality."
18492,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
18493,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,When this is realised it becomes easy to understand the instability of
18494,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"heroic society. The military followers of a peace-loving king, unless"
18495,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"he was very wealthy and generous, were liable to drift away, while the"
18496,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,bulk of the population counted for nothing. In the absence of any truly
18497,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,national organisation or national feeling all depended on the personal
18498,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,qualities of the leaders. Under Theodric the Ostrogoths were the chief
18499,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,power in Europe; but within thirty years of his death they disappear
18500,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,and are not heard of again. Under Dušan the Servians seemed destined
18501,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,to absorb all that was left of the Greek empire; after his death they
18502,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,failed to offer any effective resistance to the Turks. The kingdoms
18503,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,of the Greek Heroic Age seem to have succumbed to much less formidable
18504,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,antagonists. So numerous indeed are cases of this kind that one is
18505,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,perhaps justified in regarding national disaster as the normal ending
18506,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,of such epochs.

18510,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"The Heroic Age, both Greek and Teutonic, presents us with the picture"
18511,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,of a society largely free from restraint of any kind. In the higher
18512,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,ranks tribal law has ceased to maintain its force; and its decay leaves
18513,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the individual free from obligations both to the kindred and to the
18514,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,community. He may disregard the bonds of kinship even to the extent of
18515,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,taking a kinsman's life; and he recognises no authority beyond that of
18516,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the lord whose service he has entered. The same freedom is exhibited in
18517,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,his attitude to the deities.
18518,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
18519,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,It is of course in princes that we find these features most strongly
18520,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,developed. That which they prize above all else is the ability to
18521,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,indulge their desires to the full--in feasting and every form of
18522,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"enjoyment for themselves, in unlimited generosity to their friends, in"
18523,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"ferocious vindictiveness towards their foes. The hero of the Odyssey,"
18524,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"when his opportunity arrives, sets no limit to the vengeance which he"
18525,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"exacts, from prince, goatherd and maidservant. Achilles, the chief hero"
18526,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"of the Iliad, is transformed into a savage when he gets possession of"
18527,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the dead body of his enemy. His story furnishes a fitting parallel
18528,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"to that of Alboin, whose brutal conduct brought upon him so swift a"
18529,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,retribution. And it is to be remembered that this Alboin's generosity
18530,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,was a theme of poetry from Italy to England.
18531,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
18532,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,The best side of heroic kingship may be seen in such a character as
18533,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Hrothgar. His conception of the duties of a national ruler may have
18534,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,been of a somewhat elementary character. But it is rather as the
18535,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,head of a large household that we have to regard him; and as such
18536,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,he commands our esteem. Even in the Merovingian family--we may cite
18537,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,Gregory's description (III 25) of Theodberht--there were princes who
18538,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,won the respect of Roman ecclesiastics. In the courts of such princes
18539,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,the conditions of life were probably as good as at any time for many
18540,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,centuries later. We have no reason for supposing that the case was
18541,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,otherwise in the Heroic Age of Greece.
18542,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,
18543,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,But above all we have to remember the heroic poems. It is not
18544,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"reasonable to regard the Anglo-Saxon poems, much less the Homeric"
18545,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"poems, as products of barbarism. The courts which gave birth to such"
18546,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"poetry must have appropriated to a considerable extent the culture,"
18547,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"as well as the wealth and luxury, of earlier civilisations. It is to"
18548,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,be remarked however that the hold which these poems have exercised
18549,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"on subsequent ages, in very different stages of culture, is due not"
18550,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,only to their artistic qualities but also to the absorbing interest
18551,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,of the situations which they depict. This interest arises very
18552,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,largely from the extraordinary freedom from restraint enjoyed by the
18553,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,characters in the gratification of their feelings and desires and
18554,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,from the tremendous and sudden vicissitudes of fortune to which they
18555,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,are exposed. The pictures presented to us are those of persons by no
18556,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,means ignorant of the pleasures and even the refinements of civilised
18557,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"life, yet dominated by the pride and passions which spring from an"
18558,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,entirely reckless individualism and untrained by experience to exercise
18559,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,moderation. According to the view put forward above the explanation of
18560,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,such features is to be found not so much in any peculiarly fertile gift
18561,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,of imagination by which the conventional court poetry of these periods
18562,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,"was inspired, but rather in the circumstances of the times and in the"
18563,THE CAUSES AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEROIC AGE,character of the courts which produced that poetry.

18580,FOOTNOTES:,it. I do not myself regard the use of iron weapons as an essential
18581,FOOTNOTES:,characteristic of the Heroic Age. The evidence seems to me to indicate
18582,FOOTNOTES:,that such weapons came into use only towards the close of the period
18583,FOOTNOTES:,(cf. p. 199 ff.).
18584,FOOTNOTES:,

18587,FOOTNOTES:,"racial (physical), rather than linguistic, characteristics in view. But"
18588,FOOTNOTES:,I am not clear whether he means to include among his 'Celts' peoples
18589,FOOTNOTES:,who used other than Celtic languages.
18590,FOOTNOTES:,
18591,FOOTNOTES:,[641] What I mean by the term 'Homeric civilisation' will probably be
18592,FOOTNOTES:,clear from Chapters X and XI. I cannot admit that a satisfactory case
18593,FOOTNOTES:,has been made out for believing the civilisation of the Heroic Age to
18594,FOOTNOTES:,have differed widely from that of the poets' own times. The excavations
18595,FOOTNOTES:,at Cnossos have brought to light the existence (in 'Late Minoan' times)
18596,FOOTNOTES:,"of a highly organised bureaucratic system, for which analogies enough"
18597,FOOTNOTES:,are to be found in Egyptian records of the same period. But the poems
18598,FOOTNOTES:,themselves do not give the slightest hint of acquaintance with such a
18599,FOOTNOTES:,system. The absence of striking inconsistencies which has been remarked
18600,FOOTNOTES:,above (p. 241) is unintelligible unless the civilisation with which
18601,FOOTNOTES:,the poets themselves were acquainted--presumably in Aeolis--was a more
18602,FOOTNOTES:,or less direct continuation of that of the Heroic Age. Such changes as
18603,FOOTNOTES:,"had taken place were in general probably of a retrograde character,"
18604,FOOTNOTES:,in spite of the growing use of iron and possibly also of riding. But
18605,FOOTNOTES:,"there is no ground, so far as I can see, for supposing that the Homeric"

18614,FOOTNOTES:,[643] Aristotle (_Meteorolog._ I 14. 21 f.) applies the term Ἑλλὰς ἡ

18616,FOOTNOTES:,held that in this he was following a late Molossian story relating to
18617,FOOTNOTES:,"Dodona, rather than a genuine tradition. Yet the part played by the"
18618,FOOTNOTES:,Acheron in Greek religion and poetry (cf. p. 422) suggests that this
18619,FOOTNOTES:,region was at one time traditionally regarded by a portion of the Greek
18620,FOOTNOTES:,race as its homeland.
18621,FOOTNOTES:,
18622,FOOTNOTES:,"[644] A different view is taken by Prof. Meyer (_Gesch. d. Alt._², I §"
18623,FOOTNOTES:,"473, note) who accepts the statement of the Lydian historian Xanthos"
18624,FOOTNOTES:,"(quoted by Strabo, XIV 5. 29; cf. XII 8. 3) that the Phrygian invasion"
18625,FOOTNOTES:,took place μετὰ τὰ Τρωικά. He holds that this statement is confirmed
18626,FOOTNOTES:,"by a passage in Proclus' epitome of the Telegony (cf. Kinkel, _Epic."
18627,FOOTNOTES:,"Gr. Fragm._, p. 57), where the Thesprotoi are represented as being at"
18628,FOOTNOTES:,war with the Brygoi. But the latter are clearly the Brygoi of Albania;
18629,FOOTNOTES:,and there is nothing in the context to suggest that the Phrygians (of
18630,FOOTNOTES:,Asia) were believed to be still with their kinsfolk in the west. It
18631,FOOTNOTES:,"seems to me that the statement of a fifth century writer, who is known"
18632,FOOTNOTES:,"only from fragments, requires stronger confirmation than this before"
18633,FOOTNOTES:,it can be accepted as evidence for the chronological relationship
18634,FOOTNOTES:,of events which took place some seven centuries before his time.
18635,FOOTNOTES:,Especially is this the case when such a statement is directly opposed
18636,FOOTNOTES:,"to several passages in the Iliad, which clearly recognise the presence"
18637,FOOTNOTES:,of the Phrygians in Asia. In view of the fact that the queen (Hecabe)
18638,FOOTNOTES:,is said to be a Phrygian it is scarcely safe to assume that these
18639,FOOTNOTES:,"elements are unessential or late additions to the story. But, more than"
18640,FOOTNOTES:,"this, Xanthos' account itself does not appear to be free from Homeric"
18641,FOOTNOTES:,influence. The names Βερεκύντων and Ἀσκανίας may possibly be derived
18642,FOOTNOTES:,from Phrygian tradition--perhaps ultimately from the same source as
18643,FOOTNOTES:,Il. II 862 f.--but the leader's name (Σκαμάνδριος) is not only Homeric
18644,FOOTNOTES:,"but obviously a derivative of Σκαμάνδρος, the name of a river in the"
18645,FOOTNOTES:,Troad. It may be observed that a hero of the same name (Hector's son)
18646,FOOTNOTES:,figures in a somewhat similar story recorded by Strabo elsewhere (XIII
18647,FOOTNOTES:,1. 52); and for my part I see no reason for attaching more importance
18648,FOOTNOTES:,to Xanthos' account than to this. The expression ἐκ ... τῶν ἀριστερῶν
18649,FOOTNOTES:,τοῦ Πόντου clearly suggests that he had confused the tradition of the
18650,FOOTNOTES:,"Phrygian invasion with certain much later movements (of the Bithynians,"
18651,FOOTNOTES:,"Thynoi, etc.), some of which do seem to have proceeded from the"
18652,FOOTNOTES:,quarter indicated. On the other hand all the evidence which we have
18653,FOOTNOTES:,"(cf. Herodotus, VII 73 and VIII 138, and the position of the Brygoi in"
18654,FOOTNOTES:,historical times) points to the western part of the Balkan peninsula as
18655,FOOTNOTES:,the original home of the Phrygians.
18656,FOOTNOTES:,
18657,FOOTNOTES:,As to the nationality of the Trojans themselves--the Homeric
18658,FOOTNOTES:,Trojans--Prof. Meyer does not appear to have expressed an opinion.
18659,FOOTNOTES:,The question will doubtless be discussed in the next volume of his
18660,FOOTNOTES:,work. His theory however would seem to involve that any historical
18661,FOOTNOTES:,events which may underlie the story of the Iliad must be referred at
18662,FOOTNOTES:,least to the thirteenth century; for the date which he gives for the
18663,FOOTNOTES:,"Phrygian invasion is about, or shortly after, 1200. Here again however"
18664,FOOTNOTES:,I cannot help thinking that the evidence is far from conclusive. There
18665,FOOTNOTES:,"may very well be a connection between the fall of the Hittite kingdom,"
18666,FOOTNOTES:,"which apparently did take place about this time, and the invasion"
18667,FOOTNOTES:,encountered by Rameses III (cf. p. 188). But I am by no means clear
18668,FOOTNOTES:,why it is necessary to conclude that the Phrygian invasion immediately
18669,FOOTNOTES:,preceded these events. If the Masa and Dardenui of the Poem of Pentaur
18670,FOOTNOTES:,are rightly identified with the Mysians and Dardanoi we shall probably
18671,FOOTNOTES:,have to date the earliest settlements at least a century before this
18672,FOOTNOTES:,time. As for the Dardanoi--who apparently were regarded as the parent
18673,FOOTNOTES:,stock of the Homeric Trojans (cf. Il. XX 215 ff.)--I see no reason for
18674,FOOTNOTES:,doubting their European origin any more than that of the Phrygians
18675,FOOTNOTES:,"(Brygoi) and the Mysians (Moisoi), whose neighbours they were both in"
18676,FOOTNOTES:,Asia and in the Balkans. But at the same time there seems to me to be
18677,FOOTNOTES:,equally little reason for referring the events on which the Iliad is
18678,FOOTNOTES:,based to times anterior to the eleventh century.
18679,FOOTNOTES:,
18680,FOOTNOTES:,[645] Under such conditions the nearest approach to the heroic spirit
18681,FOOTNOTES:,is afforded by athletic contests. Such contests have at times produced
18682,FOOTNOTES:,what we may call 'heroic' poetry of Stage I (cf. p. 94). But the motive
18683,FOOTNOTES:,for further elaboration of the stories is wanting.

18691,FOOTNOTES:,from the provinces than from Italy itself. In many cases it would

18700,FOOTNOTES:,the Attacotti were a British people; and they are mentioned by Ammianus

18707,FOOTNOTES:,[649] This appears to be the view taken by Prof. Meyer (_Gesch. d.

18709,FOOTNOTES:,fully in his next volume. Here I need only mention that the recent
18710,FOOTNOTES:,discoveries of wall-paintings at Tiryns and elsewhere seem to me to

18742,FOOTNOTES:,"[655] This explanation is rejected by Dr Dörpfeld (_Ath. Mitt._, XXXIII"

18766,FOOTNOTES:,burning a man's personal effects--presumably at death--in a hole cut in

18830,FOOTNOTES:,XIII 576 f. we may probably infer that the Thracian peoples had early
18831,FOOTNOTES:,become famous for the manufacture of weapons. Influence from this

18833,FOOTNOTES:,But it should be observed that Homeric poetry shows some acquaintance

18837,FOOTNOTES:,not without significance that the two latter of these occur in the most

18839,FOOTNOTES:,guaranteed by the aspirate (as against Δυέσται).
18840,FOOTNOTES:,
18841,FOOTNOTES:,[665] The extent of these movements may be estimated by the number
18842,FOOTNOTES:,of names which occur both in the Balkan peninsula and on the east

18850,FOOTNOTES:,seem to indicate that the movements from the Balkan peninsula were not
18851,FOOTNOTES:,confined to the Asiatic mainland. Even in Asia Minor itself however
18852,FOOTNOTES:,the Thraco-Phrygian movements may at first have affected a much larger
18853,FOOTNOTES:,area than that in which languages of this type survived in historical
18854,FOOTNOTES:,times. Herodotus (I 171) states that on the ground of common ancestry
18855,FOOTNOTES:,the Carians allowed Lydians and Mysians to use the temple at Mylasa--a
18856,FOOTNOTES:,"privilege which they did not concede to other peoples, even to those"
18857,FOOTNOTES:,who spoke the same language as themselves. This passage is usually
18858,FOOTNOTES:,interpreted as pointing to a traditional religious federation of the
18859,FOOTNOTES:,indigenous peoples. But it is a serious objection to this view that
18860,FOOTNOTES:,the Mysians were clearly of European origin. If the Lydian and Carian
18861,FOOTNOTES:,"languages were non-Indo-European, as is commonly believed, they may"
18862,FOOTNOTES:,"have been taken over from indigenous peoples such as the Caunioi,"
18863,FOOTNOTES:,whose language was similar to that of the Carians and who seem to
18864,FOOTNOTES:,have been among the peoples excluded from the temple at Mylasa. The
18865,FOOTNOTES:,possibility that the Carian language belonged originally to the Caunioi
18866,FOOTNOTES:,is suggested by Herodotus himself.

18907,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,recently been somewhat facilitated by Richter's _Chronologische Studien
18908,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"zur ags. Literatur_ (Halle, 1910). The general effect of Dr Richter's"
18909,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,investigations is to confirm the view put forward by Prof. Sarazzin
18910,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"(_Engl. Stud._, XVIII 170 ff.) as to the antiquity of Genesis A."
18911,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"Unfortunately I fear that the statistics are not complete and, further,"
18912,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,that the evidence is not always treated with strict impartiality.
18913,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,Thus in Beowulf such half-verses as _to widan feore_ are regarded as
18914,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,proofs of shortening (through loss of _h_) and reckoned in the final
18915,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"statistics (pp. 9, 85); but in Genesis A the metrically equivalent _on"
18916,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"fyore lifde_ is not so reckoned (pp. 24, 89). The half-verse _geseon"
18917,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"meahton_ is cited in Beowulf without qualification (p. 15), but in"
18918,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,Exodus as doubtful (p. 18). In Beowulf _-wundor seon_ is taken to be
18919,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"-×- (pp. 13, 15), but in Daniel A it is treated as doubtful (p. 32)."
18920,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,Dr Richter's conclusion that Genesis A is an earlier poem than Beowulf
18921,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,is certainly not substantiated by the treatment of _feore_ or of
18922,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"postconsonantal _r_, _l_, _m_, _n_[670], or again by that of _frea_,"
18923,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"_don_, _gan_, _sie_[670]; while compounds such as _þreanyd_ obviously"
18924,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,do not stand on the same footing as case-forms like _þrea_. It is only
18925,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,in the treatment of intervocalic _h_ that Genesis A apparently shows
18926,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,a more archaic character than Beowulf. In the former poem Dr Richter
18927,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"cites only one case of contraction (p. 28), and even this is doubtful;"
18928,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,but the same remark applies to at least 18 of the 24 (genuine) cases
18929,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,which he cites for Beowulf (p. 15). Out of the five or six probable
18930,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,cases of contraction in this poem three occur in practically the same
18931,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"phrase--_in_ (_on_, _to_) _sele þam hean_--while two of the others"
18932,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,occur in consecutive verses (910 f.). The conclusion to which the
18933,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,evidence seems to me to point is that both Genesis A and Beowulf (even
18934,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"in its Christianised form) date from the seventh century, but that the"
18935,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,former has been somewhat better preserved than the latter. As Genesis A
18936,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"is doubtless of monastic origin, we may reasonably expect that it was"
18937,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,committed to writing at an earlier date. In the intervening period the
18938,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,text of Beowulf may have suffered many changes (such as the insertion
18939,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,of the article) at the hands of minstrels.
18940,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,
18941,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"The further question raised by Prof. Sarazzin (_op. cit._, p. 192 ff.)"
18942,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,as to the relationship of Genesis A to Caedmon cannot be discussed
18943,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,here. But in view of the evidence brought forward I do think it
18944,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,would be worth while to examine and compare the characteristics of
18945,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,the various 'Caedmonic' poems from all points of view. Apart from
18946,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,the extremely improbable dating of certain sound-changes proposed by
18947,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,Prof. Morsbach (cf. p. 66 ff. above) and accepted both by Sarazzin
18948,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"and Richter, I see no reason for supposing that Caedmon's poems have"
18949,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,entirely perished.

18953,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"Page 61, l. 4 ff. Throughout this book I have followed the view"
18954,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,generally held by scholars in the past that the expression _geongum
18955,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,cempan_ in Beow. 2044 refers to Ingeld. In recent years several
18956,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"scholars have adopted a different interpretation, viz. that it means"
18957,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,not the prince himself but a nameless member of his retinue. This
18958,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"interpretation is due primarily to v. 2061 f., where it has been"
18959,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"assumed, somewhat hastily in my opinion, (1) that _se oðer_ must"
18960,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,denote the slayer and (2) that Ingeld's own country is the scene
18961,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,of the tragedy. On the basis of this interpretation Prof. Olrik
18962,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"(_Danmarks Heltedigtning_, II p. 30 ff., especially p. 37 ff.) has"
18963,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,now put forward a theory that the episode in Beowulf has little more
18964,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"than the names in common with Saxo's story of Ingellus' revenge, and"
18965,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,that the latter is in its main features the creation of a Danish poet
18966,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,of Harold Bluetooth's time. His explanation is certainly interesting
18967,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,and ingenious; but at the same time it appears to me to be open to
18968,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,serious objections. Thus he has to admit (p. 39) that in the only
18969,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,other reference to the bridal tragedy ('bryllupskampen') contained
18970,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,in the poem (v. 82 ff.) the scene is laid in the Danish king's hall.
18971,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,His explanation is that here we have a variant form of the story (cf.
18972,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"Widsith, v. 45 ff), emanating from a different poet. But surely one"
18973,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,cannot place much confidence in an interpretation which involves the
18974,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,assumption of such an inconsistency as this[671]. Still more important
18975,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,is the reference to Ingeld (_Hinieldus_) in Alcuin's letter to Hygebald
18976,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"(cf. p. 41), which Prof. Olrik seems to have entirely ignored. From"
18977,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,this passage it would seem that Ingeld's fame was as great in England
18978,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,in the eighth century as it ever became in Denmark; and such fame
18979,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,is scarcely compatible with the passive rôle assigned to him by the
18980,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"theory under discussion. But, more than this, have we any ground for"
18981,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,supposing that Alcuin did not exercise his judgment in taking Ingeld
18982,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,as his example of a _perditus rex_? If the story of Ingeld known to
18983,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"him was substantially identical with that recorded by Saxo, as I"
18984,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"myself believe, he could hardly have found a case in which Christian"
18985,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,and heathen obligations presented a more glaring contrast. To the
18986,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,heathen this hero appealed as the pious son who exacts vengeance for
18987,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"his father's death; but to the Christian he was doubly abhorrent, not"
18988,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,merely as a heathen but also as a murderer and a truce-breaker.
18989,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,
18990,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,Like other heroic stories recorded by Saxo and Icelandic authors the
18991,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,story of Ingellus has without doubt a long poetic history behind it.
18992,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,Prof. Olrik's investigations have rendered it probable that an element
18993,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,in this poetry dates from the tenth century. It may be that the poem
18994,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,used by Saxo was actually composed--or recast--at that time. But I must
18995,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,confess to some scepticism as to the possibility of determining with
18996,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,certainty what proportion of the material is to be assigned to the
18997,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,various periods intermediate between the sixth and twelfth centuries;
18998,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,and I am disposed to think that in general Prof. Olrik has underrated
18999,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,the significance of the earlier elements.

19011,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,found only on coins. My impression from a perusal of the material
19012,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,collected in Mr Searle's _Onomasticon Anglo-Saxonicum_ is that this
19013,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,element will not appreciably affect the statistics.

19033,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,a careful and detailed examination of the Märchen in question.
19034,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"Unfortunately I have not been able to use this work, as it did not"
19035,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,come into my hands until the first eight chapters of my book were in
19036,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"print. In regard to those points on which I have chiefly laid stress,"
19037,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,viz. that Beowulf is to be identified with Biarki and that he appears
19038,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"to be a historical character, Prof. Panzer's views (pp. 368 ff., 390"
19039,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,ff.) are practically identical with those expressed above. On the
19040,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,other hand he holds that the story of Biarki--the portion dealing with
19041,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"his origin, as well as the adventure at Leire--comes from the same"
19042,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,folk-tale as the story of Beowulf and Grendel. His theory as a whole
19043,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,gives rise to important questions regarding the origin and distribution
19044,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"of folk-tales, which cannot be discussed here. Thus I should like to"
19045,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,know how far the same folk-tale can arise independently in different
19046,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"regions. Again, the Märchen with which he deals seem to me to be highly"
19047,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"composite structures, which I should be inclined to regard rather"
19048,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,as aggregations of folk-tales. This is true more especially of the
19049,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,"elements common to the stories of Beowulf, Grettir and Ormr, the close"
19050,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,affinities of which have been brought into a much clearer light by
19051,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,Prof. Panzer's researches. It may be that the elaborate story which
19052,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,underlies all three was treated in poetry at an early date; but I see
19053,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,no more reason now than before for believing that the two Icelandic
19054,ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.,stories have been affected by any poem dealing with Beowulf himself.
