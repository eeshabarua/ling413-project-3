43,M DCCC LXXXIX,
44,M DCCC LXXXIX,
45,M DCCC LXXXIX,The epic poem of Gu-drun is one of the most important early literary
46,M DCCC LXXXIX,works of the German race. It is attributed to the latter part of the
47,M DCCC LXXXIX,"twelfth or the beginning of the thirteenth century, and to a date a"
48,M DCCC LXXXIX,little subsequent to that of the Nibelungen Lied. It was first brought to
49,M DCCC LXXXIX,"the notice of the modern world in the year 1817, the only original"
50,M DCCC LXXXIX,manuscript now known to exist having been discovered about that time in
51,M DCCC LXXXIX,"the castle Ambras in the Tyrol, among other manuscripts which had been"
52,M DCCC LXXXIX,collected by the Emperor Maximilian I. (1493-1519). The manuscript is now
53,M DCCC LXXXIX,in the Imperial Library at Vienna. It has been several times edited and
54,M DCCC LXXXIX,"printed in the original Middle High German, with critical annotations;"
55,M DCCC LXXXIX,various translations into modern German have also been published: but so
56,M DCCC LXXXIX,"far as I can learn, no complete metrical version in the English language"
57,M DCCC LXXXIX,has been made public.
58,M DCCC LXXXIX,
59,M DCCC LXXXIX,The name of the author is unknown; it is generally thought to have been
60,M DCCC LXXXIX,"constructed, in great measure, from earlier legends which had been"
61,M DCCC LXXXIX,"repeated by wandering singers. According to the late Karl Bartsch, the"
62,M DCCC LXXXIX,"distinguished critic and editor of Mediæval German literature, the tale"
63,M DCCC LXXXIX,"shows affinity to legends of the Scalds of Norway and Denmark, and to"
64,M DCCC LXXXIX,those of the Shetland Isles. Traces of resemblance are said to be found
65,M DCCC LXXXIX,among the relics of Anglo-Saxon literature. The supposition that the poem
66,M DCCC LXXXIX,was constructed from various early legends explains some of the
67,M DCCC LXXXIX,"marvellous incidents of the tale, and those chronological inconsistencies"
68,M DCCC LXXXIX,where the rude habits and ideas of earlier times are combined with the
69,M DCCC LXXXIX,later knightly usages of the Middle Ages and with Christian belief.
70,M DCCC LXXXIX,
71,M DCCC LXXXIX,"The scene of the poem is laid principally on the shores of the North Sea,"
72,M DCCC LXXXIX,"and includes Ireland and Normandy, as well as Holland, Denmark, and"
73,M DCCC LXXXIX,"Friesland. Very vague ideas of geography were, however, entertained by"
74,M DCCC LXXXIX,"the poet. Some names of places are thought to be fabulous, and critics"
75,M DCCC LXXXIX,disagree with regard to the modern countries designated by other names
76,M DCCC LXXXIX,used.
77,M DCCC LXXXIX,
78,M DCCC LXXXIX,"The poem is founded upon the themes of love and war, and properly"
79,M DCCC LXXXIX,"consists of three parts. The first portion, embracing four tales, relates"
80,M DCCC LXXXIX,"the adventures of Hagen, the grandfather of Gu-drun; the second part"
81,M DCCC LXXXIX,"gives the story of the wooing and abduction of Hilda, his daughter, the"
82,M DCCC LXXXIX,mother of Gu-drun. The proper story of Gu-drun begins only with the ninth
83,M DCCC LXXXIX,tale.
84,M DCCC LXXXIX,
85,M DCCC LXXXIX,"The narrative gives a vivid picture of the ideas, manners, and customs of"
86,M DCCC LXXXIX,"the age of the author; of the dwellings, dress, and ornaments in use; of"
87,M DCCC LXXXIX,the weapons and warfare; of the ships and sea-life; and of the
88,M DCCC LXXXIX,tournaments and court festivities. From it we see the nature of the
89,M DCCC LXXXIX,"intellectual amusement enjoyed by the northern nations, at that period of"
90,M DCCC LXXXIX,their mental development when literary entertainment in the modern sense
91,M DCCC LXXXIX,"was yet unknown, and its place was supplied by listening to the recitals"
92,M DCCC LXXXIX,of wandering bards.
93,M DCCC LXXXIX,
94,M DCCC LXXXIX,Modern German critics agree in assigning a high literary value to the
95,M DCCC LXXXIX,"poem of Gu-drun, and compare it not unfavorably with the Nibelungen Lied."
96,M DCCC LXXXIX,"Bartsch, the critic above named, says: ""The general impression which the"
97,M DCCC LXXXIX,"poem gives is one of greater beauty, though not always of equal grandeur"
98,M DCCC LXXXIX,with that of the Nibelungen; it is a worthy companion-piece. The two are
99,M DCCC LXXXIX,"justly compared, as are the Iliad and the Odyssey. In the Nibelungen as"
100,M DCCC LXXXIX,"in the Iliad the fate of a whole people is decided by the sword, and the"
101,M DCCC LXXXIX,"ruling house, consisting of noble heroes, meets destruction before our"
102,M DCCC LXXXIX,eyes; but the conquerors do not fully rejoice in their success. The whole
103,M DCCC LXXXIX,"breathes a tragic spirit, even more than the Greek epic. '_Nach Freude"
104,M DCCC LXXXIX,Leid_'--'after joy comes sorrow'--is the earnest tone throughout.
105,M DCCC LXXXIX,"Gu-drun, like the Odyssey, closes more tenderly and in a spirit of"
106,M DCCC LXXXIX,reconciliation. Although pitiless fate has destroyed the happiness of
107,M DCCC LXXXIX,"those for whom the poet has awakened our sympathy, and we see a noble"
108,M DCCC LXXXIX,"being suffer in the most shameful manner, yet we are sustained by hope,"
109,M DCCC LXXXIX,and a happy end compensates for woes endured. '_Aus Leid
110,M DCCC LXXXIX,Freude_'--'sorrows end in joy'--is the final conclusion.... All the
111,M DCCC LXXXIX,"characters are worked out in the most minute and careful manner, and are"
112,M DCCC LXXXIX,"developed consistently.... The best traits of the German nature, fearless"
113,M DCCC LXXXIX,"bravery, unfaltering fidelity, and unswerving integrity, are presented."
114,M DCCC LXXXIX,"The nobility of a feminine soul which, inspired by pure love, in the"
115,M DCCC LXXXIX,"distress of a hard captivity, preserves its fidelity to its beloved,"
116,M DCCC LXXXIX,perhaps in no poem of the German middle ages is so strikingly shown as in
117,M DCCC LXXXIX,the character of Gu-drun.... The descriptions both of battle and scenery
118,M DCCC LXXXIX,"are masterly, and are painted with a few decisive strokes."""
119,M DCCC LXXXIX,
120,M DCCC LXXXIX,The metrical form of Gu-drun is similar to that of the Nibelungen. In
121,M DCCC LXXXIX,"both, the accentuation is determined by the logical sense, as in prose,"
122,M DCCC LXXXIX,"and not always by the number of syllables, as in most modern verse. In"
123,M DCCC LXXXIX,"both, the lines are metrically divided, giving three accents to each"
124,M DCCC LXXXIX,"half-line of the stanza, except in the fourth line, in which Gu-drun"
125,M DCCC LXXXIX,differs from the Nibelungen in having five accents instead of four on the
126,M DCCC LXXXIX,concluding half-line.
127,M DCCC LXXXIX,
128,M DCCC LXXXIX,"The translator has adhered to the original rhythm, and has endeavored in"
129,M DCCC LXXXIX,"each stanza to convey strictly the ideas of the author, being careful not"
130,M DCCC LXXXIX,"to introduce anything, in thought or simile, foreign to the poem, and, as"
131,M DCCC LXXXIX,"far as the verse would permit, to give a verbal rendering."
132,M DCCC LXXXIX,
133,M DCCC LXXXIX,The translation has been made from Bartsch's edition of the original
134,M DCCC LXXXIX,"Middle High German (Brockhaus, Leipzig, 1874). He, like the other"
135,M DCCC LXXXIX,"editors, has supplied some omissions in the manuscript, an instance of"
136,M DCCC LXXXIX,which may be seen in the sixth line of the fac-simile given. The drawings
137,M DCCC LXXXIX,introduced are copied from mediæval German printed books.
138,M DCCC LXXXIX,
139,M DCCC LXXXIX,I wish to acknowledge my obligation to my brother for careful revision
140,M DCCC LXXXIX,and for many important improvements throughout the translation.

152,M. P. N.,"Tale I. Sigeband, king of Ireland, after the death of his father,"
153,M. P. N.,"marries a princess of Norway, who bears him a son, Hagen."
154,M. P. N.,"During the celebration of a court festival, Hagen, now"
155,M. P. N.,"seven years old, while outside the castle in the care of"
156,M. P. N.,"his attendants, is caught up by a griffin, and borne to"
157,M. P. N.,his nest in a distant land.   Stanzas 1-66.
158,M. P. N.,"Tale II. Hagen, falling from the grasp of one of the young"
159,M. P. N.,"griffins, crawls into a cave, where he finds three young"
160,M. P. N.,"daughters of kings, who had also been carried off by the"
161,M. P. N.,"griffins. He grows up in their company. At last, one day,"
162,M. P. N.,"he wanders with them to the seashore, where he finds a"
163,M. P. N.,"ship whose master, a lord from Karadie, he persuades to"
164,M. P. N.,rescue them from their exile.   67-113.
165,M. P. N.,Tale III. The master of the ship inquires of Hagen and the
166,M. P. N.,"maidens concerning their country, and learns that Hagen"
167,M. P. N.,is the son of an old enemy. He threatens to keep him as a
168,M. P. N.,"hostage, but Hagen seizes thirty of the sailors, and"
169,M. P. N.,"flings them into the sea, and compels the others to steer"
170,M. P. N.,"towards his home. There, he sends messengers to announce"
171,M. P. N.,"his arrival to his father and mother, who come down to"
172,M. P. N.,the shore to meet him.   114-150.
173,M. P. N.,Tale IV. Hagen reconciles his father to the men who had brought
174,M. P. N.,"him home, and receives from his father the government of"
175,M. P. N.,"the kingdom. He marries one of the three maidens, Hilda,"
176,M. P. N.,"from India. She gives birth to a daughter, likewise named"
177,M. P. N.,"Hilda. When she is grown up, her many suitors are"
178,M. P. N.,rejected by her father.   151-203.
179,M. P. N.,"Tale V. Hettel, king of the Hegelings, a suitor for Hilda,"
180,M. P. N.,"summons his vassals, Wâ-te, Horant, and Fru-te, and sends"
181,M. P. N.,"them to obtain her for his wife. They go, purporting to"
182,M. P. N.,"be merchants, carrying seven hundred warriors concealed"
183,M. P. N.,"in the hold of the ship. They send rich gifts to Hagen,"
184,M. P. N.,"and at the request of his daughter, Hilda, they are"
185,M. P. N.,kindly received at court.   204-371.
186,M. P. N.,"Tale VI. Horant delights the court with his singing, and he with"
187,M. P. N.,his friend Morunc are introduced to the bower of Hilda.
188,M. P. N.,"He tells her of Hettel's suit, which she, charmed by the"
189,M. P. N.,"singing of Horant, receives with favor. They invite her"
190,M. P. N.,"to visit their ship, with her father and mother, and the"
191,M. P. N.,invitation is accepted.   372-439.
192,M. P. N.,"Tale VII. Hilda, with her father and mother and her maidens,"
193,M. P. N.,rides down to the shore; she and the maidens go on board
194,M. P. N.,"the ship. While Hagen's attention is occupied, the vessel"
195,M. P. N.,"sets sail, and they arrive in Hettel's land.   440-486."
196,M. P. N.,"Tale VIII. Hagen and his warriors follow in their ships, in order"
197,M. P. N.,"to rescue Hilda, and reach the Hegeling land: a battle"
198,M. P. N.,"takes place on the seashore. At Hilda's entreaty, peace"
199,M. P. N.,"is made, and Hagen consents to her marriage with Hettel."
200,M. P. N.,"Hagen returns home, leaving Hilda and her maidens in"
201,M. P. N.,Hettel's kingdom.   487-562.
202,M. P. N.,"Tale IX. Wâ-te, Horant, and the other vassals of Hettel go back"
203,M. P. N.,"to their homes. Hilda bears to Hettel a son, Ortwin, and"
204,M. P. N.,"a daughter, Gu-drun, who is afterwards sought by"
205,M. P. N.,"Siegfried, king of Moorland. He is rejected by her"
206,M. P. N.,"father, Hettel, and retires in anger.   563-586."
207,M. P. N.,"Tale X. Hartmut, a Norman prince, son of Ludwig and Gerlind,"
208,M. P. N.,"hears of the beauty of Gu-drun, and resolves to woo her."

211,M. P. N.,"Tale XI. Herwic, king of Sealand, sends suitors for the hand of"
212,M. P. N.,"Gu-drun, who are also rejected. Hartmut of Normandy comes"
213,M. P. N.,"to woo her in person, and is kindly received by her; she,"
214,M. P. N.,"however, begs him, if he values his life, to leave the"
215,M. P. N.,"court. He returns to Normandy, resolved to win her by"
216,M. P. N.,force.   617-629.
217,M. P. N.,"Tale XII. Herwic, being forbidden by Hettel to woo his daughter,"

220,M. P. N.,"Tale XIII. Siegfried, a rival suitor for Gu-drun, invades the"

226,M. P. N.,"Gu-drun, his daughter, his success in the fight with"
227,M. P. N.,"Siegfried. Hartmut, the Norman, takes advantage of the"
228,M. P. N.,"absence of both Hettel and Herwic, and invades the"
229,M. P. N.,Hegeling kingdom.   725-752.
230,M. P. N.,Tale XV. Hartmut sends messengers again to Gu-drun to ask her
231,M. P. N.,"hand, and threatens to take her by force if she still"
232,M. P. N.,rejects his suit. She answers that she is betrothed to
233,M. P. N.,"Herwic, and refuses him. Hartmut and Ludwig bring an army"
234,M. P. N.,"and capture the Hegeling castle, and carry away Gu-drun"
235,M. P. N.,with her hand-maidens.   753-809.
236,M. P. N.,"Tale XVI. Hettel and Herwic, being informed of their losses by"
237,M. P. N.,"Hilda, make peace with Siegfried, and release him on"
238,M. P. N.,condition that he will unite with them in war against
239,M. P. N.,Hartmut. They take possession of the ships of a pilgrim
240,M. P. N.,"band, and pursue Hartmut.   810-846."
241,M. P. N.,"Tale XVII. Ludwig and Hartmut, on their way to Normandy with"
242,M. P. N.,"Gu-drun, stop at a desert island, called Wulpensand;"

244,M. P. N.,battle ensues.   847-879.
245,M. P. N.,"Tale XVIII. Ludwig, king of the Normans, slays Hettel, and his"
246,M. P. N.,army steals away with the maidens in the night. The
247,M. P. N.,"Hegelings discover their departure, bury the dead, and"
248,M. P. N.,erect a hospital and cloister in their memory.   880-918.
249,M. P. N.,"Tale XIX. The Hegelings return, and announce to Queen Hilda the"
250,M. P. N.,death of her husband and their ill-success. They decide
251,M. P. N.,"to wait till the young knights become old enough for war,"
252,M. P. N.,and then to make a second campaign against the Normans.
253,M. P. N.,919-950.
254,M. P. N.,Tale XX. The Normans reach their land with Gu-drun and her
255,M. P. N.,"maidens; she refuses to marry Hartmut, and is placed in"
256,M. P. N.,"the care of Gerlind, his mother, who treats her harshly"
257,M. P. N.,"and obliges her to perform menial service. Ortrun, the"
258,M. P. N.,"sister of Hartmut, shows kindness to Gu-drun.   951-1040."
259,M. P. N.,"Tale XXI. Gu-drun receives better treatment, but, still refusing"
260,M. P. N.,"to marry Hartmut, she is sent to wash clothes on the"
261,M. P. N.,"seashore. Hildeburg, one of her maidens, obtains"
262,M. P. N.,"permission to share her labors, which are continued"
263,M. P. N.,through many years.   1041-1070.
264,M. P. N.,Tale XXII. Hilda summons her vassals to make an expedition
265,M. P. N.,against the Normans. After visiting the graves of their
266,M. P. N.,"kinsmen on the Wulpensand, they pass in safety the"
267,M. P. N.,"magnetic rocks at Givers, and arrive on the coast of"
268,M. P. N.,Normandy.   1071-1141.
269,M. P. N.,"Tale XXIII. Herwic and Ortwin, the brother of Gu-drun, agree to"
270,M. P. N.,go forward in advance to procure intelligence in regard
271,M. P. N.,to her and her maidens.   1142-1164.
272,M. P. N.,Tale XXIV. While Gu-drun and Hildeburg are washing on the
273,M. P. N.,"seashore, a swan announces to them the approach of Queen"
274,M. P. N.,"Hilda's army for their rescue, and tells them that two"
275,M. P. N.,knights will come the next morning to inform them still
276,M. P. N.,further of this.   1165-1206.
277,M. P. N.,"Tale XXV. Herwic and Ortwin, coming in a boat, see the maidens"
278,M. P. N.,"washing on the shore, recognize them, and make themselves"
279,M. P. N.,known. Thinking it dishonorable to take the maids away
280,M. P. N.,"without winning them in fight, the knights return to"
281,M. P. N.,"bring their army. The maidens go back to Gerlind, and,"
282,M. P. N.,"feeling sure of her speedy rescue, Gu-drun pretends to"
283,M. P. N.,"agree to Hartmut's suit, and is restored to favor."
284,M. P. N.,1207-1334.
285,M. P. N.,"Tale XXVI. On their return to their friends, Herwic and Ortwin"
286,M. P. N.,make known the result of their search. The Hegeling army
287,M. P. N.,"arrives before the Norman castle, and is discovered by"
288,M. P. N.,Ludwig and Hartmut.   1335-1365.
289,M. P. N.,Tale XXVII. Hartmut names to Ludwig the banners of the coming
290,M. P. N.,knights. On learning that the Hegeling army is
291,M. P. N.,"approaching, Gerlind counsels her son, Hartmut, to await"
292,M. P. N.,"a siege; but he chooses to sally forth, with Ludwig and"
293,M. P. N.,"their followers, and a battle ensues, in which Ludwig"
294,M. P. N.,overthrows Herwic.   1366-1440.
295,M. P. N.,"Tale XXVIII. Herwic, feeling mortified that Gu-drun from the"
296,M. P. N.,"castle should see his fall, returns to the fight, and"
297,M. P. N.,slays Ludwig. Gerlind bribes one of her men to put
298,M. P. N.,"Gu-drun to death, but he is prevented by the threats of"
299,M. P. N.,"Hartmut. Hartmut is taken prisoner, and carried on board"
300,M. P. N.,a ship.   1441-1493.
301,M. P. N.,"Tale XXIX. The Hegelings obtain possession of the castle, and"
302,M. P. N.,spare neither old nor young. Ortrun seeks refuge with
303,M. P. N.,"Gu-drun, and Gerlind also implores her protection, but"
304,M. P. N.,she is recognized and killed by Wâ-te. The Hegeling army
305,M. P. N.,devastate the land: Hartmut and Ortrun are held captive.
306,M. P. N.,1494-1560.
307,M. P. N.,"Tale XXX. The Hegeling army returns home, bringing Gu-drun and"
308,M. P. N.,"her maidens, with the Norman captives. Hilda welcomes the"
309,M. P. N.,"returning ships, and embraces her daughter, whom she does"
310,M. P. N.,"not at first recognize, after her long absence. By"
311,M. P. N.,"Gu-drun's request, Hilda is reconciled to Hartmut and"
312,M. P. N.,"Ortrun, and Ortwin takes Ortrun for his bride. Hartmut"
313,M. P. N.,"and his men are set free, on their promise not to escape,"
314,M. P. N.,and Hartmut agrees to wed Hildeburg. Herwic's sister is
315,M. P. N.,"sent for, and betrothed to Siegfried.    1561-1666."
316,M. P. N.,"Tale XXXI. A great wedding festival is held, at which the four"
317,M. P. N.,"kings, Herwic, Ortwin, Hartmut, and Siegfried, try to"
318,M. P. N.,surpass each other in generous giving. Hartmut with his
319,M. P. N.,"bride, Hildeburg, leaves for Normandy.   1667-1695."
320,M. P. N.,"Tale XXXII. Siegfried, king of Moorland, goes home, taking his"
321,M. P. N.,"bride, Herwic's sister. Herwic returns to his home with"
322,M. P. N.,"Gu-drun, after she has bidden farewell to her mother,"
323,M. P. N.,"Hilda, and to her brother, Ortwin, and Ortrun, his wife."

887,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,Of how their stay was ended    I will speak no longer here;
888,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"Now I tell you further    of the rushing flight in the air,"
889,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,That the child with the angry griffin    far away was bearing.
890,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,For this his friends and kinsmen    long in their hearts were heavy

892,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,
893,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,[68]
894,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,Because the Lord so willed it    the child was not yet dead;
895,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"But, none the less, he later    a life of sadness led,"
896,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,After the harsh old griffin    back to his nestlings bore him.
897,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"When on their prey they gloated,    hard toil enough the boy had now"

899,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,
900,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,[69]
901,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"Soon as the bird that bore him    did on his nest alight,"
902,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"He dropped the boy he carried,    and in his claws held tight;"
903,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,One of the young ones caught him:    that he did not devour him
904,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"Thanks to God thereafter    were given, far and wide, for the watch"

909,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"Now listen all with wonder,    and his bitter sorrow learn:"
910,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,Hear how the king of Ireland    then from death was shielded;
911,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"Him a young bird now carried,    strongly clutched, and naught of his"
912,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,grip he yielded.
913,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,
914,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,[71]
915,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,From tree to tree in the forest    he with the boy took flight;
916,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,The bird a little too boldly    trusted his strength and might.
917,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"Upon a branch he lighted,    but now to the ground must flutter,"
918,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,For he was much too heavy;    in the nest to have longer staid had
919,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,methinks been better.
920,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,
921,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,[72]
922,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"The child, while the bird was falling,    broke from him away,"
923,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"And hid among the bushes,    a little, lorn estray;"
924,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"Well-nigh was he to starving,    'twas long since food he tasted."
925,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,Yet on a day long after    the hopes of women in Ireland on him rested.

927,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,[73]
928,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"God doth many a wonder,    truly one may say."
929,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"By the craft of the mighty griffin,    it came to pass one day,"
930,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"Three daughters fair of princes    had been taken thither,"
931,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,And now near by were dwelling.    No man can tell how there they lived

933,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,
934,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,[74]
935,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"And how, thro' days so many,    their lives to them were spared,"

937,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,Hagen now no longer    need live  without a fellow;
938,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,Those good and lovely maidens    soon found the little waif in a rocky

940,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,
941,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,[75]
942,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"When, crawling to his hiding,    they the child did see,"
943,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"It might, so thought the maidens,    a dwarfish goblin be,"
944,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"Or perhaps it was a water-oaf,    from out the sea up-driven;"
945,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"But when the boy came near them,    at once a welcome kind to him was"
946,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,given.
947,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,
948,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,[76]
949,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"Hagen was ware of the maidens,    as into their cave they stole,"
950,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"While with fear and sadness    their little hearts were full,"
951,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,Before they yet had knowledge    that they a Christian greeted.
952,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,But the care they later showed him    lifted the pain from many hearts

954,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,
955,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,[77]
956,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"First spake the eldest maiden:    ""How darest thou in our cave,"

961,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,
962,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,[78]
963,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"The high-born child then answered:    ""I pray you let me stay;"

965,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"One of the griffins seized me,    and to the cave did carry;"

968,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,
969,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,[79]
970,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,Then to the child so friendless    they loving welcome gave;
971,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,But they of his worth thereafter    did better knowledge have.
972,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"They now could ask him only,    whence he had been stolen;"
973,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"But, such was then his hunger,    in telling his tale, his heart was"
974,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,full and swollen.
975,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,
976,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,[80]
977,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"Then spake the little foundling:    ""Food I sorely need;"

982,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,
983,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,[81]
984,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"Then answered one of the maidens:    ""Our lot it so hath been,"

986,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"Neither our lordly steward,    who should food to us be giving."""
987,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"Still they praised God's goodness;    altho' their years were few, they"

989,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,
990,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,[82]
991,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"A search they soon were making    for roots and herbage wild,"

993,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,Such food as they had lived on    they gave to him most freely;
994,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"To him 'twas a meal unwonted,    but such as they long time had eaten"

996,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,
997,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,[83]
998,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"Yet he needs must eat it,    for hunger sore he hath,"

1000,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"Thro' all the days so dreary,    while with the maidens dwelling,"

1005,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"They, too, had him in keeping,    that can I say for truth;"

1018,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,[86]
1019,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,Soon the ship was shattered;    not one his life could save.
1020,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,Quickly the stern old griffins    came down beside the wave;

1035,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"He thought, among the wreckage,    food might still lie hidden;"
1036,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"But, through fear of the wicked griffins,    he softly crept to the"

1039,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,[89]
1040,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"No one could he find there,    but a body in armor alone;"
1041,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,Thereby the wild old griffin    hard work would give him soon.
1042,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"Out from his armor he shook him,    nor did he spurn to wear it:"
1043,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"He found a bow and weapons,    by its side, on the sandy shore, lying"

1045,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,
1046,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,[90]
1047,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"With these himself he girded,    that simple little child;"

1049,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"He wished that he had loitered,    the sorry little master;"
1050,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,But quickly came the griffin;    to the sheltering cavern fain would he
1051,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,flee the faster.
1052,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,
1053,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,[91]
1054,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,The bird swung down in anger    to the sandy beach and foam;
1055,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"The little playmate and fellow    of the young it left at home,"
1056,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,Would by the angry griffin    have at once been swallowed;
1057,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,But now the bold young Hagen    the ways of a daring foeman bravely
1058,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,followed.
1059,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,
1060,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,[92]
1061,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"He with strength but youthful    the tightened string drew out,"
1062,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,And arrows swift and many    from the well-bent bow he shot.
1063,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,Alas! he did not hit him;    what hope of his ill-luck turning?
1064,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,Then he of the sword bethought him;    he heard the maids bewailing him
1065,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,and mourning.
1066,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,
1067,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,[93]
1068,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"Tho' his years were not yet many,    he still was brave enough;"
1069,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"A wing from the angry griffin    he struck at the shoulder off,"
1070,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,And in the leg he smote him    a heavier blow and stronger;
1071,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,So that his wounded body    the bird away from the spot could drag no

1073,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,
1074,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,[94]
1075,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,The boy was now the winner;    one of his foes lay dead;

1089,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"His call they kindly welcomed,    and many times, forsooth,"
1090,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,The boy by the lovely maidens    was kissed upon the mouth.

1094,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,
1095,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,[97]
1096,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"By help of the boy, from sorrow    they now were wholly free;"

1112,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,"To catch them it were easy,    but yet he did not get them,"
1113,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,For with fire his kitchen smoked not.    Daily his sorrow grew that he

1116,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,[100]
1117,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,Oft from his rocky shelter    to the forest he would roam;

1129,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,
1130,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,[102]
1131,HOW HAGEN SLEW THE GRIFFIN.,Then with the skin of the monster    he wrapped himself around;

3586,KINGDOM.,wasted.
3587,KINGDOM.,
3588,KINGDOM.,[451]
3589,KINGDOM.,"Onward came King Hagen;    his fighting-gear he wore,"
3590,KINGDOM.,"And a heavy sword, the sharpest,    he proudly with him bore;"
3591,KINGDOM.,But now the aged Wâ-te    almost too long had waited;
3592,KINGDOM.,"Wild and grim was Hagen,    and high his spear he raised 'gainst his"
3593,KINGDOM.,foe belated.
3594,KINGDOM.,
3595,KINGDOM.,[452]
3596,KINGDOM.,"Loudly then he shouted,    and bade his men make haste;"
3597,KINGDOM.,"None of all his followers    would he allow to rest,"
3598,KINGDOM.,"Hoping these guests, now fleeing,    who had been such traitors,"
3599,KINGDOM.,"Might be with speed o'ertaken,    and either should be slain, or bound"
3600,KINGDOM.,in fetters.
3601,KINGDOM.,
3602,KINGDOM.,[453]
3603,KINGDOM.,"The king had now about him    fighters many and brave,"
3604,KINGDOM.,But yet he could not follow    across the wild sea-wave;
3605,KINGDOM.,"His ships were all unready,    and many of them leaking,"
3606,KINGDOM.,When now he would be sailing;    of Hagen's blame for this were all
3607,KINGDOM.,soon speaking.
3608,KINGDOM.,
3609,KINGDOM.,[454]
3610,KINGDOM.,"On the gravelly sea-shore standing,    no other way he knew"
3611,KINGDOM.,"But that more ships be builded    for him and his liegemen true,"
3612,KINGDOM.,"And workmen called together,    who must therein be speedy:"
3613,KINGDOM.,"All came who now were able,    and these he found to be both skilled"
3614,KINGDOM.,and ready.
3615,KINGDOM.,
3616,KINGDOM.,[455]
3617,KINGDOM.,"Upon the seventh morning,    there left the Irish land"
3618,KINGDOM.,"The men sent forth by Hettel    to ask for Hilda's hand,"
3619,KINGDOM.,And bring to him the lady.    They were a thousand barely;
3620,KINGDOM.,"Hagen brought against them    thirty hundred men, if reckoned fairly."
3621,KINGDOM.,
3622,KINGDOM.,[456]
3623,KINGDOM.,"The daring knights of Denmark    sent men home before,"
3624,KINGDOM.,"To carry word to Hettel    that Hagen's child they bore,"
3625,KINGDOM.,"And to his land would bring her,    with honor him befitting."
3626,KINGDOM.,"Though now they little thought it,    still harder work erelong must"
3627,KINGDOM.,they be meeting.
3628,KINGDOM.,
3629,KINGDOM.,[457]
3630,KINGDOM.,"To them their master, Hettel,    in happy mood then spoke:"
3631,KINGDOM.,"""My sorrows now are over.    Great toils my liegemen took"
3632,KINGDOM.,"For me in Hagen's kingdom,    and now have brought me gladness;"
3633,KINGDOM.,"Since they on their errand left me,    fear for their doom has filled"
3634,KINGDOM.,my heart with sadness.
3635,KINGDOM.,
3636,KINGDOM.,[458]
3637,KINGDOM.,"""Dear friends, if with your tidings    you have not me betrayed,"
3638,KINGDOM.,And do not tell me falsely    that you have seen the maid
3639,KINGDOM.,"Near to my land and kingdom,    and in my friends' safe-keeping,"
3640,KINGDOM.,"For your tale will I reward you,    and gladly will your praise be ever"
3641,KINGDOM.,"speaking."""
3642,KINGDOM.,
3643,KINGDOM.,[459]
3644,KINGDOM.,"They said: ""No lie we tell you,    that we the maid have seen;"
3645,KINGDOM.,"But when we miles had measured,    the daughter of the queen"
3646,KINGDOM.,"Sadly said, for our welfare    she feared, and was heavy-hearted,"
3647,KINGDOM.,"Lest the king, her father,    to follow with his ships e'en then had"
3648,KINGDOM.,"started."""
3649,KINGDOM.,
3650,KINGDOM.,[460]
3651,KINGDOM.,"For the tidings, Hettel gave them    a hundred marks in worth;"
3652,KINGDOM.,"For all his knights there gathered,    men at once brought forth"
3653,KINGDOM.,"Swords as well as helmets,    and shields for them were bidden:"
3654,KINGDOM.,"Thus from Hettel's castle    they went, as if to court, to bring the"
3655,KINGDOM.,maiden.
3656,KINGDOM.,
3657,KINGDOM.,[461]
3658,KINGDOM.,All the men he was able    Hettel for this now sought;
3659,KINGDOM.,"Greatly was he hoping,    and much thereof he thought,"
3660,KINGDOM.,"So great a host to muster,    and these so well outfitted,"
3661,KINGDOM.,That never to king's fair daughter    so fine a welcome might again be
3662,KINGDOM.,meted.
3663,KINGDOM.,
3664,KINGDOM.,[462]
3665,KINGDOM.,In haste were all then bidden    who ought with him to go;
3666,KINGDOM.,"They still made ready slowly,    till gifts he should bestow"
3667,KINGDOM.,Of all things that they needed;    they for this were waiting.
3668,KINGDOM.,"At length by him were gathered    a thousand men or more, for Hilda's"
3669,KINGDOM.,greeting.
3670,KINGDOM.,
3671,KINGDOM.,[463]
3672,KINGDOM.,"Gay were they in clothing,--    'gainst this could none say nay,--"
3673,KINGDOM.,Poor as well as wealthy    were shining in war-array:
3674,KINGDOM.,To bring the lovely ladies    to their new home and dwelling
3675,KINGDOM.,Were Hettel's lieges earnest;    with lofty hopes of this their hearts
3676,KINGDOM.,were swelling.
3677,KINGDOM.,
3678,KINGDOM.,[464]
3679,KINGDOM.,"Soon as they left the castle,    shouts the land did fill,"
3680,KINGDOM.,As they their way were making    thro' lowland and o'er hill;
3681,KINGDOM.,Men saw upon the pathways    crowds still thronging nearer:
3682,KINGDOM.,"Hettel hastened forward,    to see the maid, than every other dearer."
3683,KINGDOM.,
3684,KINGDOM.,[465]
3685,KINGDOM.,"At last the aged Wâ-te,    the knight from the Sturmisch land,"
3686,KINGDOM.,Had reached the Waalisch marches    and stepped upon the sand.
3687,KINGDOM.,"There on the shore were gathered    the sailors, water-weary;"
3688,KINGDOM.,"Shelter they sought for Hilda,    and in a friendly land were glad to"
3689,KINGDOM.,tarry.
3690,KINGDOM.,
3691,KINGDOM.,[466]
3692,KINGDOM.,Stakes for tents were driven    near to the broad sea-flood
3693,KINGDOM.,By the followers of Wâ-te;    they were in happy mood.
3694,KINGDOM.,"Erelong the news was bruited,    and soon to them was given,"
3695,KINGDOM.,"That Hettel, king of the Hegelings,    had left his home, and now was"
3696,KINGDOM.,near them even;
3697,KINGDOM.,
3698,KINGDOM.,[467]
3699,KINGDOM.,"And that he with many liegemen    was riding down to the shore,"
3700,KINGDOM.,To meet his well-belovéd.    Now hoped the maids the more
3701,KINGDOM.,"That she with greatest honor    should, as her birth befitted,"
3702,KINGDOM.,Be brought into his kingdom.    No more the thought of strife their
3703,KINGDOM.,hearts affrighted.
3704,KINGDOM.,
3705,KINGDOM.,[468]
3706,KINGDOM.,"The guests for nothing wanted,    they had both wine and food;"
3707,KINGDOM.,Those who were living near them    freely on them bestowed
3708,KINGDOM.,The best that they were able;    the wants of all they heeded;
3709,KINGDOM.,"Whate'er they had they gave them,    and left them not to lack for"
3710,KINGDOM.,aught they needed.
3711,KINGDOM.,
3712,KINGDOM.,[469]
3713,KINGDOM.,Hettel now drew nearer    to those who had reached his land;
3714,KINGDOM.,"And with him, gathered hastily,    the strong and goodly band,"
3715,KINGDOM.,"Drawn from his father's kingdom.    They came bedecked so gaily,"
3716,KINGDOM.,"And in such glittering armor,    the guests looked on full glad, and"
3717,KINGDOM.,praised them freely.
3718,KINGDOM.,
3719,KINGDOM.,[470]
3720,KINGDOM.,"Then the men of the Hegelings    came down upon the plain,"
3721,KINGDOM.,And soon the rushing riders    a tilting-match began;
3722,KINGDOM.,All with youthful boldness    for knightly prizes striving:
3723,KINGDOM.,"Then came the Danish Fru-te,    and with him Wâ-te, wise as any living."
3724,KINGDOM.,
3725,KINGDOM.,[471]
3726,KINGDOM.,They were seen from afar by Hettel;    happy in heart was he.
3727,KINGDOM.,His horse he set a-prancing;    right glad was he to see
3728,KINGDOM.,"Two of his bravest liegemen,    sent by him o'er the water,"
3729,KINGDOM.,"With fighters bold to Ireland,    in hopes to win for him wild Hagen's"
3730,KINGDOM.,daughter.
3731,KINGDOM.,
3732,KINGDOM.,[472]
3733,KINGDOM.,"On him, too, looked they gladly,    their worthy king, so good;"
3734,KINGDOM.,Each day they spent there with him    found them in happy mood.
3735,KINGDOM.,"Wâ-te with all his fellows,    while far away they were living,"
3736,KINGDOM.,Had known much bitter hardship:    for this would Hettel now reward be
3737,KINGDOM.,giving.
3738,KINGDOM.,
3739,KINGDOM.,[473]
3740,KINGDOM.,"As he met his friendly liegemen,    King Hettel wore a smile;"
3741,KINGDOM.,"Then said he to them kindly:    ""Much have I feared erewhile"
3742,KINGDOM.,"For you, my faithful helpers,    and a heavy heart was bearing,"
3743,KINGDOM.,"Lest in Hagen's castles    my men were held, and all were bondage"
3744,KINGDOM.,"sharing."""
3745,KINGDOM.,
3746,KINGDOM.,[474]
3747,KINGDOM.,"Then for love he kissed them,    both those gray old men;"
3748,KINGDOM.,"His eyes had never rested    on so glad a sight as then,"
3749,KINGDOM.,"Nor on a fairer pasture    had fed, with longing fonder."
3750,KINGDOM.,I ween that never to Hettel    was aught so full of bliss and sudden
3751,KINGDOM.,wonder.
3752,KINGDOM.,
3753,KINGDOM.,[475]
3754,KINGDOM.,Then spake the aged Wâ-te:    No harm to us was done;
3755,KINGDOM.,"But yet a sway so mighty    I ne'er before have known,"
3756,KINGDOM.,As this that wild King Hagen    over his lands now wieldeth:
3757,KINGDOM.,"His followers bear them proudly,    and he himself in strength to no"
3758,KINGDOM.,one yieldeth.
3759,KINGDOM.,
3760,KINGDOM.,[476]
3761,KINGDOM.,"""It was a day as happy    as ever could be thought,"
3762,KINGDOM.,"When we to you sent tidings    that we had Hilda brought,"
3763,KINGDOM.,"The loveliest of maidens    (no falsehood have I spoken,"
3764,KINGDOM.,Believe the tale I tell you)    that ever in this world my eyes did
3765,KINGDOM.,"look on."""
3766,KINGDOM.,
3767,KINGDOM.,[477]
3768,KINGDOM.,"The high-born knight then added:    ""Belike with greatest speed"
3769,KINGDOM.,Will come these daring foemen;    for this should you take heed
3770,KINGDOM.,Lest the angry Hagen    soon shall overtake us
3771,KINGDOM.,"Here within your marches;    if so, his hatred bitter woe will make"
3772,KINGDOM.,"us."""
3773,KINGDOM.,
3774,KINGDOM.,[478]
3775,KINGDOM.,Then Wâ-te and Sir Fru-te    down to the shore did bring
3776,KINGDOM.,"Many worthy followers,    knights of Hettel, the king,"
3777,KINGDOM.,"There to see fair Hilda,    and there must they await her."
3778,KINGDOM.,Upon their shining bucklers    many a spear-shaft crashed in battle
3779,KINGDOM.,later.
3780,KINGDOM.,
3781,KINGDOM.,[479]
3782,KINGDOM.,"Now came the fair young maiden,    under a comely hat;"
3783,KINGDOM.,Then all the men of the Hegelings    who on their horses sat
3784,KINGDOM.,"By the side of the king, their master,    upon the grass alighted."
3785,KINGDOM.,With merry hearts then gladly    the well-bred throng their love and
3786,KINGDOM.,friendship plighted.
3787,KINGDOM.,
3788,KINGDOM.,[480]
3789,KINGDOM.,"Irold, he of Ortland,    and Morunc of the Frisian land,"
3790,KINGDOM.,"Both of those brave champions,    one on either hand,"
3791,KINGDOM.,"Came with lovely Hilda,    and Hettel soon were meeting;"
3792,KINGDOM.,Worthy was she of praises.    Now thought the maid to give the king her
3793,KINGDOM.,greeting.
3794,KINGDOM.,
3795,KINGDOM.,[481]
3796,KINGDOM.,"With her there came young maidens,    twenty or even more,"
3797,KINGDOM.,"All clad in fair white linen,--    whiter none e'er wore,--"
3798,KINGDOM.,"Or best of silken clothing,    that could be found by any:"
3799,KINGDOM.,"Proud were they to wear them,    and, gaily decked, they there were"
3800,KINGDOM.,seen by many.
3801,KINGDOM.,
3802,KINGDOM.,[482]
3803,KINGDOM.,"The king, both good and stately,    then began to greet"
3804,KINGDOM.,"With well-bred, seemly bearing,    the maid he thought was meet"
3805,KINGDOM.,To wear the crown hereafter.    He gazed on her with yearning;
3806,KINGDOM.,"Her in his arms he folded,    and fondly kissed the maid, her face"
3807,KINGDOM.,upturning.
3808,KINGDOM.,
3809,KINGDOM.,[483]
3810,KINGDOM.,Then one by one he welcomed    all the maidens fair;
3811,KINGDOM.,But one there was among them    so lofty in her air
3812,KINGDOM.,She might of birth be kingly:    in nought her kin were lacking.
3813,KINGDOM.,She was one of the maidens    who with the griffin long her home was
3814,KINGDOM.,making.
3815,KINGDOM.,
3816,KINGDOM.,[484]
3817,KINGDOM.,"She bore the name of Hildeburg:    from Hilda, Hagen's wife,"
3818,KINGDOM.,She ever had won the honor    befitting her worthy life;
3819,KINGDOM.,"Born in the land of Portugal,    thence had she been taken."
3820,KINGDOM.,She now saw many strangers:    a longing sad for her friends did this
3821,KINGDOM.,awaken.
3822,KINGDOM.,
3823,KINGDOM.,[485]
3824,KINGDOM.,"Hettel to all the maidens    gave a welcome free,"
3825,KINGDOM.,Yet was their lot no brighter;    for when they thought to see
3826,KINGDOM.,"An end of all their sadness,    upon the coming morrow,"
3827,KINGDOM.,"Soon as the day was dawning,    there came to them again as great a"
3828,KINGDOM.,sorrow.
3829,KINGDOM.,
3830,KINGDOM.,[486]
3831,KINGDOM.,Her throng of high-born followers    were greeted on every side;
3832,KINGDOM.,"Near to Hagen's daughter    on a flowery meadow wide,"
3833,KINGDOM.,"Under silken awnings,    many there were seated."
3834,KINGDOM.,But Hagen was now too near them;    to them from him must many ills be
3835,KINGDOM.,meted.
