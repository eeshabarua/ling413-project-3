46,CANTO XIII,
47,CANTO XIII,"ERE Nessus yet had reach'd the other bank,"
48,CANTO XIII,"We enter'd on a forest, where no track"
49,CANTO XIII,Of steps had worn a way.  Not verdant there
50,CANTO XIII,"The foliage, but of dusky hue; not light"
51,CANTO XIII,"The boughs and tapering, but with knares deform'd"
52,CANTO XIII,"And matted thick: fruits there were none, but thorns"
53,CANTO XIII,"Instead, with venom fill'd. Less sharp than these,"
54,CANTO XIII,"Less intricate the brakes, wherein abide"
55,CANTO XIII,"Those animals, that hate the cultur'd fields,"
56,CANTO XIII,Betwixt Corneto and Cecina's stream.
57,CANTO XIII,
58,CANTO XIII,"Here the brute Harpies make their nest, the same"
59,CANTO XIII,Who from the Strophades the Trojan band
60,CANTO XIII,Drove with dire boding of their future woe.
61,CANTO XIII,"Broad are their pennons, of the human form"
62,CANTO XIII,"Their neck and count'nance, arm'd with talons keen"
63,CANTO XIII,"The feet, and the huge belly fledge with wings"
64,CANTO XIII,These sit and wail on the drear mystic wood.
65,CANTO XIII,
66,CANTO XIII,The kind instructor in these words began:
67,CANTO XIII,"""Ere farther thou proceed, know thou art now"
68,CANTO XIII,"I' th' second round, and shalt be, till thou come"
69,CANTO XIII,Upon the horrid sand: look therefore well
70,CANTO XIII,"Around thee, and such things thou shalt behold,"
71,CANTO XIII,"As would my speech discredit.""  On all sides"
72,CANTO XIII,"I heard sad plainings breathe, and none could see"
73,CANTO XIII,From whom they might have issu'd.  In amaze
74,CANTO XIII,"Fast bound I stood.  He, as it seem'd, believ'd,"
75,CANTO XIII,That I had thought so many voices came
76,CANTO XIII,"From some amid those thickets close conceal'd,"
77,CANTO XIII,"And thus his speech resum'd: ""If thou lop off"
78,CANTO XIII,"A single twig from one of those ill plants,"
79,CANTO XIII,"The thought thou hast conceiv'd shall vanish quite."""
80,CANTO XIII,
81,CANTO XIII,"Thereat a little stretching forth my hand,"
82,CANTO XIII,"From a great wilding gather'd I a branch,"
83,CANTO XIII,"And straight the trunk exclaim'd: ""Why pluck'st thou me?"""
84,CANTO XIII,
85,CANTO XIII,"Then as the dark blood trickled down its side,"
86,CANTO XIII,"These words it added: ""Wherefore tear'st me thus?"
87,CANTO XIII,Is there no touch of mercy in thy breast?
88,CANTO XIII,"Men once were we, that now are rooted here."
89,CANTO XIII,"Thy hand might well have spar'd us, had we been"
90,CANTO XIII,"The souls of serpents.""  As a brand yet green,"
91,CANTO XIII,That burning at one end from the' other sends
92,CANTO XIII,"A groaning sound, and hisses with the wind"
93,CANTO XIII,"That forces out its way, so burst at once,"
94,CANTO XIII,Forth from the broken splinter words and blood.
95,CANTO XIII,
96,CANTO XIII,"I, letting fall the bough, remain'd as one"
97,CANTO XIII,"Assail'd by terror, and the sage replied:"
98,CANTO XIII,"""If he, O injur'd spirit! could have believ'd"
99,CANTO XIII,"What he hath seen but in my verse describ'd,"
100,CANTO XIII,He never against thee had stretch'd his hand.
101,CANTO XIII,"But I, because the thing surpass'd belief,"
102,CANTO XIII,"Prompted him to this deed, which even now"
103,CANTO XIII,"Myself I rue.  But tell me, who thou wast;"
104,CANTO XIII,"That, for this wrong to do thee some amends,"
105,CANTO XIII,In the upper world (for thither to return
106,CANTO XIII,"Is granted him) thy fame he may revive."""
107,CANTO XIII,
108,CANTO XIII,"""That pleasant word of thine,"" the trunk replied"
109,CANTO XIII,"""Hath so inveigled me, that I from speech"
110,CANTO XIII,"Cannot refrain, wherein if I indulge"
111,CANTO XIII,"A little longer, in the snare detain'd,"
112,CANTO XIII,"Count it not grievous.  I it was, who held"
113,CANTO XIII,"Both keys to Frederick's heart, and turn'd the wards,"
114,CANTO XIII,"Opening and shutting, with a skill so sweet,"
115,CANTO XIII,"That besides me, into his inmost breast"
116,CANTO XIII,Scarce any other could admittance find.
117,CANTO XIII,"The faith I bore to my high charge was such,"
118,CANTO XIII,It cost me the life-blood that warm'd my veins.
119,CANTO XIII,"The harlot, who ne'er turn'd her gloating eyes"
120,CANTO XIII,"From Caesar's household, common vice and pest"
121,CANTO XIII,"Of courts, 'gainst me inflam'd the minds of all;"
122,CANTO XIII,"And to Augustus they so spread the flame,"
123,CANTO XIII,That my glad honours chang'd to bitter woes.
124,CANTO XIII,"My soul, disdainful and disgusted, sought"
125,CANTO XIII,"Refuge in death from scorn, and I became,"
126,CANTO XIII,"Just as I was, unjust toward myself."
127,CANTO XIII,"By the new roots, which fix this stem, I swear,"
128,CANTO XIII,"That never faith I broke to my liege lord,"
129,CANTO XIII,"Who merited such honour; and of you,"
130,CANTO XIII,"If any to the world indeed return,"
131,CANTO XIII,"Clear he from wrong my memory, that lies"
132,CANTO XIII,"Yet prostrate under envy's cruel blow."""
133,CANTO XIII,
134,CANTO XIII,"First somewhat pausing, till the mournful words"
135,CANTO XIII,"Were ended, then to me the bard began:"
136,CANTO XIII,"""Lose not the time; but speak and of him ask,"
137,CANTO XIII,"If more thou wish to learn.""  Whence I replied:"
138,CANTO XIII,"""Question thou him again of whatsoe'er"
139,CANTO XIII,"Will, as thou think'st, content me; for no power"
140,CANTO XIII,"Have I to ask, such pity' is at my heart."""
141,CANTO XIII,
142,CANTO XIII,"He thus resum'd; ""So may he do for thee"
143,CANTO XIII,"Freely what thou entreatest, as thou yet"
144,CANTO XIII,"Be pleas'd, imprison'd Spirit! to declare,"
145,CANTO XIII,How in these gnarled joints the soul is tied;
146,CANTO XIII,And whether any ever from such frame
147,CANTO XIII,"Be loosen'd, if thou canst, that also tell."""
148,CANTO XIII,
149,CANTO XIII,"Thereat the trunk breath'd hard, and the wind soon"
150,CANTO XIII,Chang'd into sounds articulate like these;
151,CANTO XIII,
152,CANTO XIII,"""Briefly ye shall be answer'd.  When departs"
153,CANTO XIII,"The fierce soul from the body, by itself"
154,CANTO XIII,"Thence torn asunder, to the seventh gulf"
155,CANTO XIII,"By Minos doom'd, into the wood it falls,"
156,CANTO XIII,"No place assign'd, but wheresoever chance"
157,CANTO XIII,"Hurls it, there sprouting, as a grain of spelt,"
158,CANTO XIII,"It rises to a sapling, growing thence"
159,CANTO XIII,"A savage plant.  The Harpies, on its leaves"
160,CANTO XIII,"Then feeding, cause both pain and for the pain"
161,CANTO XIII,"A vent to grief.  We, as the rest, shall come"
162,CANTO XIII,"For our own spoils, yet not so that with them"
163,CANTO XIII,We may again be clad; for what a man
164,CANTO XIII,Takes from himself it is not just he have.
165,CANTO XIII,Here we perforce shall drag them; and throughout
166,CANTO XIII,"The dismal glade our bodies shall be hung,"
167,CANTO XIII,"Each on the wild thorn of his wretched shade."""
168,CANTO XIII,
169,CANTO XIII,Attentive yet to listen to the trunk
170,CANTO XIII,"We stood, expecting farther speech, when us"
171,CANTO XIII,"A noise surpris'd, as when a man perceives"
172,CANTO XIII,The wild boar and the hunt approach his place
173,CANTO XIII,"Of station'd watch, who of the beasts and boughs"
174,CANTO XIII,Loud rustling round him hears.  And lo! there came
175,CANTO XIII,"Two naked, torn with briers, in headlong flight,"
176,CANTO XIII,That they before them broke each fan o' th' wood.
177,CANTO XIII,"""Haste now,"" the foremost cried, ""now haste thee death!"""
178,CANTO XIII,
179,CANTO XIII,"The' other, as seem'd, impatient of delay"
180,CANTO XIII,"Exclaiming, ""Lano! not so bent for speed"
181,CANTO XIII,"Thy sinews, in the lists of Toppo's field."""
182,CANTO XIII,"And then, for that perchance no longer breath"
183,CANTO XIII,"Suffic'd him, of himself and of a bush"
184,CANTO XIII,One group he made.  Behind them was the wood
185,CANTO XIII,"Full of black female mastiffs, gaunt and fleet,"
186,CANTO XIII,As greyhounds that have newly slipp'd the leash.
187,CANTO XIII,"On him, who squatted down, they stuck their fangs,"
188,CANTO XIII,And having rent him piecemeal bore away
189,CANTO XIII,"The tortur'd limbs.  My guide then seiz'd my hand,"
190,CANTO XIII,"And led me to the thicket, which in vain"
191,CANTO XIII,"Mourn'd through its bleeding wounds: ""O Giacomo"
192,CANTO XIII,"Of Sant' Andrea! what avails it thee,"""
193,CANTO XIII,"It cried, ""that of me thou hast made thy screen?"
194,CANTO XIII,"For thy ill life what blame on me recoils?"""
195,CANTO XIII,
196,CANTO XIII,"When o'er it he had paus'd, my master spake:"
197,CANTO XIII,"""Say who wast thou, that at so many points"
198,CANTO XIII,"Breath'st out with blood thy lamentable speech?"""
199,CANTO XIII,
200,CANTO XIII,"He answer'd: ""Oh, ye spirits: arriv'd in time"
201,CANTO XIII,"To spy the shameful havoc, that from me"
202,CANTO XIII,"My leaves hath sever'd thus, gather them up,"
203,CANTO XIII,And at the foot of their sad parent-tree
204,CANTO XIII,"Carefully lay them.  In that city' I dwelt,"
205,CANTO XIII,"Who for the Baptist her first patron chang'd,"
206,CANTO XIII,Whence he for this shall cease not with his art
207,CANTO XIII,To work her woe: and if there still remain'd not
208,CANTO XIII,"On Arno's passage some faint glimpse of him,"
209,CANTO XIII,"Those citizens, who rear'd once more her walls"
210,CANTO XIII,"Upon the ashes left by Attila,"
211,CANTO XIII,Had labour'd without profit of their toil.
212,CANTO XIII,"I slung the fatal noose from my own roof."""
213,CANTO XIII,

215,CANTO XIII,
216,CANTO XIII,
217,CANTO XIV,CANTO XIV
218,CANTO XIV,
219,CANTO XIV,SOON as the charity of native land
220,CANTO XIV,"Wrought in my bosom, I the scatter'd leaves"
221,CANTO XIV,"Collected, and to him restor'd, who now"
222,CANTO XIV,Was hoarse with utt'rance.  To the limit thence
223,CANTO XIV,"We came, which from the third the second round"
224,CANTO XIV,"Divides, and where of justice is display'd"
225,CANTO XIV,Contrivance horrible.  Things then first seen
226,CANTO XIV,"Clearlier to manifest, I tell how next"
227,CANTO XIV,"A plain we reach'd, that from its sterile bed"
228,CANTO XIV,Each plant repell'd. The mournful wood waves round
229,CANTO XIV,"Its garland on all sides, as round the wood"
230,CANTO XIV,"Spreads the sad foss.  There, on the very edge,"
231,CANTO XIV,Our steps we stay'd.  It was an area wide
232,CANTO XIV,"Of arid sand and thick, resembling most"
233,CANTO XIV,The soil that erst by Cato's foot was trod.
234,CANTO XIV,
235,CANTO XIV,Vengeance of Heav'n!  Oh! how shouldst thou be fear'd
236,CANTO XIV,"By all, who read what here my eyes beheld!"
237,CANTO XIV,
238,CANTO XIV,"Of naked spirits many a flock I saw,"
239,CANTO XIV,"All weeping piteously, to different laws"
240,CANTO XIV,"Subjected: for on the' earth some lay supine,"
241,CANTO XIV,"Some crouching close were seated, others pac'd"
242,CANTO XIV,"Incessantly around; the latter tribe,"
243,CANTO XIV,"More numerous, those fewer who beneath"
244,CANTO XIV,"The torment lay, but louder in their grief."
245,CANTO XIV,
246,CANTO XIV,O'er all the sand fell slowly wafting down
247,CANTO XIV,"Dilated flakes of fire, as flakes of snow"
248,CANTO XIV,"On Alpine summit, when the wind is hush'd."
249,CANTO XIV,"As in the torrid Indian clime, the son"
250,CANTO XIV,Of Ammon saw upon his warrior band
251,CANTO XIV,"Descending, solid flames, that to the ground"
252,CANTO XIV,Came down: whence he bethought him with his troop
253,CANTO XIV,To trample on the soil; for easier thus
254,CANTO XIV,"The vapour was extinguish'd, while alone;"
255,CANTO XIV,"So fell the eternal fiery flood, wherewith"
256,CANTO XIV,"The marble glow'd underneath, as under stove"
257,CANTO XIV,"The viands, doubly to augment the pain."
258,CANTO XIV,
259,CANTO XIV,"Unceasing was the play of wretched hands,"
260,CANTO XIV,"Now this, now that way glancing, to shake off"
261,CANTO XIV,"The heat, still falling fresh.  I thus began:"
262,CANTO XIV,"""Instructor! thou who all things overcom'st,"
263,CANTO XIV,"Except the hardy demons, that rush'd forth"
264,CANTO XIV,"To stop our entrance at the gate, say who"
265,CANTO XIV,"Is yon huge spirit, that, as seems, heeds not"
266,CANTO XIV,"The burning, but lies writhen in proud scorn,"
267,CANTO XIV,"As by the sultry tempest immatur'd?"""
268,CANTO XIV,
269,CANTO XIV,"Straight he himself, who was aware I ask'd"
270,CANTO XIV,"My guide of him, exclaim'd: ""Such as I was"
271,CANTO XIV,"When living, dead such now I am.  If Jove"
272,CANTO XIV,"Weary his workman out, from whom in ire"
273,CANTO XIV,"He snatch'd the lightnings, that at my last day"
274,CANTO XIV,"Transfix'd me, if the rest be weary out"
275,CANTO XIV,At their black smithy labouring by turns
276,CANTO XIV,"In Mongibello, while he cries aloud;"
277,CANTO XIV,"""Help, help, good Mulciber!"" as erst he cried"
278,CANTO XIV,"In the Phlegraean warfare, and the bolts"
279,CANTO XIV,"Launch he full aim'd at me with all his might,"
280,CANTO XIV,"He never should enjoy a sweet revenge."""
281,CANTO XIV,
282,CANTO XIV,"Then thus my guide, in accent higher rais'd"
283,CANTO XIV,"Than I before had heard him: ""Capaneus!"
284,CANTO XIV,"Thou art more punish'd, in that this thy pride"
285,CANTO XIV,"Lives yet unquench'd: no torrent, save thy rage,"
286,CANTO XIV,"Were to thy fury pain proportion'd full."""
287,CANTO XIV,
288,CANTO XIV,Next turning round to me with milder lip
289,CANTO XIV,"He spake: ""This of the seven kings was one,"
290,CANTO XIV,"Who girt the Theban walls with siege, and held,"
291,CANTO XIV,"As still he seems to hold, God in disdain,"
292,CANTO XIV,And sets his high omnipotence at nought.
293,CANTO XIV,"But, as I told him, his despiteful mood"
294,CANTO XIV,Is ornament well suits the breast that wears it.
295,CANTO XIV,Follow me now; and look thou set not yet
296,CANTO XIV,"Thy foot in the hot sand, but to the wood"
297,CANTO XIV,"Keep ever close.""  Silently on we pass'd"
298,CANTO XIV,To where there gushes from the forest's bound
299,CANTO XIV,"A little brook, whose crimson'd wave yet lifts"
300,CANTO XIV,"My hair with horror.  As the rill, that runs"
301,CANTO XIV,"From Bulicame, to be portion'd out"
302,CANTO XIV,Among the sinful women; so ran this
303,CANTO XIV,"Down through the sand, its bottom and each bank"
304,CANTO XIV,"Stone-built, and either margin at its side,"
305,CANTO XIV,Whereon I straight perceiv'd our passage lay.
306,CANTO XIV,
307,CANTO XIV,"""Of all that I have shown thee, since that gate"
308,CANTO XIV,"We enter'd first, whose threshold is to none"
309,CANTO XIV,"Denied, nought else so worthy of regard,"
310,CANTO XIV,"As is this river, has thine eye discern'd,"
311,CANTO XIV,"O'er which the flaming volley all is quench'd."""
312,CANTO XIV,
313,CANTO XIV,"So spake my guide; and I him thence besought,"
314,CANTO XIV,"That having giv'n me appetite to know,"
315,CANTO XIV,"The food he too would give, that hunger crav'd."
316,CANTO XIV,
317,CANTO XIV,"""In midst of ocean,"" forthwith he began,"
318,CANTO XIV,"""A desolate country lies, which Crete is nam'd,"
319,CANTO XIV,Under whose monarch in old times the world
320,CANTO XIV,"Liv'd pure and chaste.  A mountain rises there,"
321,CANTO XIV,"Call'd Ida, joyous once with leaves and streams,"
322,CANTO XIV,Deserted now like a forbidden thing.
323,CANTO XIV,"It was the spot which Rhea, Saturn's spouse,"
324,CANTO XIV,Chose for the secret cradle of her son;
325,CANTO XIV,"And better to conceal him, drown'd in shouts"
326,CANTO XIV,"His infant cries.  Within the mount, upright"
327,CANTO XIV,"An ancient form there stands and huge, that turns"
328,CANTO XIV,"His shoulders towards Damiata, and at Rome"
329,CANTO XIV,As in his mirror looks.  Of finest gold
330,CANTO XIV,"His head is shap'd, pure silver are the breast"
331,CANTO XIV,And arms; thence to the middle is of brass.
332,CANTO XIV,"And downward all beneath well-temper'd steel,"
333,CANTO XIV,"Save the right foot of potter's clay, on which"
334,CANTO XIV,"Than on the other more erect he stands,"
335,CANTO XIV,"Each part except the gold, is rent throughout;"
336,CANTO XIV,"And from the fissure tears distil, which join'd"
337,CANTO XIV,Penetrate to that cave.  They in their course
338,CANTO XIV,Thus far precipitated down the rock
339,CANTO XIV,"Form Acheron, and Styx, and Phlegethon;"
340,CANTO XIV,Then by this straiten'd channel passing hence
341,CANTO XIV,"Beneath, e'en to the lowest depth of all,"
342,CANTO XIV,"Form there Cocytus, of whose lake (thyself"
343,CANTO XIV,"Shall see it) I here give thee no account."""
344,CANTO XIV,
345,CANTO XIV,"Then I to him: ""If from our world this sluice"
346,CANTO XIV,Be thus deriv'd; wherefore to us but now
347,CANTO XIV,"Appears it at this edge?""  He straight replied:"
348,CANTO XIV,"""The place, thou know'st, is round; and though great part"
349,CANTO XIV,"Thou have already pass'd, still to the left"
350,CANTO XIV,"Descending to the nethermost, not yet"
351,CANTO XIV,Hast thou the circuit made of the whole orb.
352,CANTO XIV,"Wherefore if aught of new to us appear,"
353,CANTO XIV,"It needs not bring up wonder in thy looks."""
354,CANTO XIV,
355,CANTO XIV,"Then I again inquir'd: ""Where flow the streams"
356,CANTO XIV,Of Phlegethon and Lethe? for of one
357,CANTO XIV,"Thou tell'st not, and the other of that shower,"
358,CANTO XIV,"Thou say'st, is form'd.""  He answer thus return'd:"
359,CANTO XIV,"""Doubtless thy questions all well pleas'd I hear."
360,CANTO XIV,Yet the red seething wave might have resolv'd
361,CANTO XIV,"One thou proposest.  Lethe thou shalt see,"
362,CANTO XIV,"But not within this hollow, in the place,"
363,CANTO XIV,"Whither to lave themselves the spirits go,"
364,CANTO XIV,"Whose blame hath been by penitence remov'd."""
365,CANTO XIV,"He added: ""Time is now we quit the wood."
366,CANTO XIV,Look thou my steps pursue: the margins give
367,CANTO XIV,"Safe passage, unimpeded by the flames;"
368,CANTO XIV,"For over them all vapour is extinct."""
369,CANTO XIV,
370,CANTO XIV,
371,CANTO XIV,
372,CANTO XIV,
373,CANTO XV,CANTO XV
374,CANTO XV,
375,CANTO XV,One of the solid margins bears us now
376,CANTO XV,"Envelop'd in the mist, that from the stream"
377,CANTO XV,"Arising, hovers o'er, and saves from fire"
378,CANTO XV,Both piers and water.  As the Flemings rear
379,CANTO XV,"Their mound, 'twixt Ghent and Bruges, to chase back"
380,CANTO XV,"The ocean, fearing his tumultuous tide"
381,CANTO XV,"That drives toward them, or the Paduans theirs"
382,CANTO XV,"Along the Brenta, to defend their towns"
383,CANTO XV,"And castles, ere the genial warmth be felt"
384,CANTO XV,"On Chiarentana's top; such were the mounds,"
385,CANTO XV,"So fram'd, though not in height or bulk to these"
386,CANTO XV,"Made equal, by the master, whosoe'er"
387,CANTO XV,"He was, that rais'd them here.  We from the wood"
388,CANTO XV,"Were not so far remov'd, that turning round"
389,CANTO XV,"I might not have discern'd it, when we met"
390,CANTO XV,"A troop of spirits, who came beside the pier."
391,CANTO XV,
392,CANTO XV,"They each one ey'd us, as at eventide"
393,CANTO XV,"One eyes another under a new moon,"
394,CANTO XV,"And toward us sharpen'd their sight as keen,"
395,CANTO XV,As an old tailor at his needle's eye.
396,CANTO XV,
397,CANTO XV,"Thus narrowly explor'd by all the tribe,"
398,CANTO XV,"I was agniz'd of one, who by the skirt"
399,CANTO XV,"Caught me, and cried, ""What wonder have we here!"""
400,CANTO XV,
401,CANTO XV,"And I, when he to me outstretch'd his arm,"
402,CANTO XV,"Intently fix'd my ken on his parch'd looks,"
403,CANTO XV,"That although smirch'd with fire, they hinder'd not"
404,CANTO XV,But I remember'd him; and towards his face
405,CANTO XV,"My hand inclining, answer'd: ""Sir!  Brunetto!"
406,CANTO XV,
407,CANTO XV,"""And art thou here?""  He thus to me: ""My son!"
408,CANTO XV,"Oh let it not displease thee, if Brunetto"
409,CANTO XV,Latini but a little space with thee
410,CANTO XV,"Turn back, and leave his fellows to proceed."""
411,CANTO XV,
412,CANTO XV,"I thus to him replied: ""Much as I can,"
413,CANTO XV,"I thereto pray thee; and if thou be willing,"
414,CANTO XV,"That I here seat me with thee, I consent;"
415,CANTO XV,"His leave, with whom I journey, first obtain'd."""

419,CANTO XV,"No fan to ventilate him, when the fire"
420,CANTO XV,Smites sorest.  Pass thou therefore on.  I close
421,CANTO XV,"Will at thy garments walk, and then rejoin"
422,CANTO XV,"My troop, who go mourning their endless doom."""
423,CANTO XV,
424,CANTO XV,I dar'd not from the path descend to tread
425,CANTO XV,"On equal ground with him, but held my head"
426,CANTO XV,"Bent down, as one who walks in reverent guise."
427,CANTO XV,
428,CANTO XV,"""What chance or destiny,"" thus he began,"
429,CANTO XV,"""Ere the last day conducts thee here below?"
430,CANTO XV,"And who is this, that shows to thee the way?"""
431,CANTO XV,
432,CANTO XV,"""There up aloft,"" I answer'd, ""in the life"
433,CANTO XV,"Serene, I wander'd in a valley lost,"
434,CANTO XV,Before mine age had to its fullness reach'd.
435,CANTO XV,But yester-morn I left it: then once more
436,CANTO XV,"Into that vale returning, him I met;"
437,CANTO XV,"And by this path homeward he leads me back."""
438,CANTO XV,
439,CANTO XV,"""If thou,"" he answer'd, ""follow but thy star,"
440,CANTO XV,Thou canst not miss at last a glorious haven:
441,CANTO XV,Unless in fairer days my judgment err'd.
442,CANTO XV,"And if my fate so early had not chanc'd,"
443,CANTO XV,"Seeing the heav'ns thus bounteous to thee, I"
444,CANTO XV,Had gladly giv'n thee comfort in thy work.
445,CANTO XV,"But that ungrateful and malignant race,"
446,CANTO XV,"Who in old times came down from Fesole,"
447,CANTO XV,"Ay and still smack of their rough mountain-flint,"
448,CANTO XV,Will for thy good deeds shew thee enmity.
449,CANTO XV,Nor wonder; for amongst ill-savour'd crabs
450,CANTO XV,It suits not the sweet fig-tree lay her fruit.
451,CANTO XV,"Old fame reports them in the world for blind,"
452,CANTO XV,"Covetous, envious, proud.  Look to it well:"
453,CANTO XV,Take heed thou cleanse thee of their ways.  For thee
454,CANTO XV,"Thy fortune hath such honour in reserve,"
455,CANTO XV,That thou by either party shalt be crav'd
456,CANTO XV,With hunger keen: but be the fresh herb far
457,CANTO XV,From the goat's tooth.  The herd of Fesole
458,CANTO XV,"May of themselves make litter, not touch the plant,"
459,CANTO XV,"If any such yet spring on their rank bed,"
460,CANTO XV,"In which the holy seed revives, transmitted"

462,CANTO XV,"When it was made the nest of so much ill."""
463,CANTO XV,
464,CANTO XV,"""Were all my wish fulfill'd,"" I straight replied,"
465,CANTO XV,"""Thou from the confines of man's nature yet"
466,CANTO XV,Hadst not been driven forth; for in my mind
467,CANTO XV,"Is fix'd, and now strikes full upon my heart"
468,CANTO XV,"The dear, benign, paternal image, such"
469,CANTO XV,"As thine was, when so lately thou didst teach me"
470,CANTO XV,The way for man to win eternity;
471,CANTO XV,"And how I priz'd the lesson, it behooves,"
472,CANTO XV,"That, long as life endures, my tongue should speak,"
473,CANTO XV,"What of my fate thou tell'st, that write I down:"
474,CANTO XV,And with another text to comment on
475,CANTO XV,"For her I keep it, the celestial dame,"
476,CANTO XV,"Who will know all, if I to her arrive."
477,CANTO XV,This only would I have thee clearly note:
478,CANTO XV,That so my conscience have no plea against me;
479,CANTO XV,"Do fortune as she list, I stand prepar'd."
480,CANTO XV,Not new or strange such earnest to mine ear.
481,CANTO XV,"Speed fortune then her wheel, as likes her best,"
482,CANTO XV,"The clown his mattock; all things have their course."""
483,CANTO XV,
484,CANTO XV,Thereat my sapient guide upon his right
485,CANTO XV,"Turn'd himself back, then look'd at me and spake:"
486,CANTO XV,"""He listens to good purpose who takes note."""
487,CANTO XV,
488,CANTO XV,"I not the less still on my way proceed,"
489,CANTO XV,"Discoursing with Brunetto, and inquire"
490,CANTO XV,Who are most known and chief among his tribe.
491,CANTO XV,
492,CANTO XV,"""To know of some is well;"" thus he replied,"
493,CANTO XV,"""But of the rest silence may best beseem."
494,CANTO XV,Time would not serve us for report so long.
495,CANTO XV,"In brief I tell thee, that all these were clerks,"
496,CANTO XV,"Men of great learning and no less renown,"
497,CANTO XV,By one same sin polluted in the world.
498,CANTO XV,"With them is Priscian, and Accorso's son"
499,CANTO XV,Francesco herds among that wretched throng:
500,CANTO XV,"And, if the wish of so impure a blotch"
501,CANTO XV,"Possess'd thee, him thou also might'st have seen,"
502,CANTO XV,Who by the servants' servant was transferr'd
503,CANTO XV,"From Arno's seat to Bacchiglione, where"
504,CANTO XV,"His ill-strain'd nerves he left.  I more would add,"
505,CANTO XV,But must from farther speech and onward way
506,CANTO XV,"Alike desist, for yonder I behold"
507,CANTO XV,A mist new-risen on the sandy plain.
508,CANTO XV,"A company, with whom I may not sort,"
509,CANTO XV,"Approaches.  I commend my TREASURE to thee,"
510,CANTO XV,"Wherein I yet survive; my sole request."""
511,CANTO XV,
512,CANTO XV,"This said he turn'd, and seem'd as one of those,"
513,CANTO XV,Who o'er Verona's champain try their speed
514,CANTO XV,"For the green mantle, and of them he seem'd,"
515,CANTO XV,Not he who loses but who gains the prize.

522,CANTO XVI,"NOW came I where the water's din was heard,"
523,CANTO XVI,"As down it fell into the other round,"
524,CANTO XVI,Resounding like the hum of swarming bees:
525,CANTO XVI,"When forth together issu'd from a troop,"
526,CANTO XVI,"That pass'd beneath the fierce tormenting storm,"
527,CANTO XVI,"Three spirits, running swift.  They towards us came,"
528,CANTO XVI,"And each one cried aloud, ""Oh do thou stay!"
529,CANTO XVI,Whom by the fashion of thy garb we deem
530,CANTO XVI,"To be some inmate of our evil land."""
531,CANTO XVI,
532,CANTO XVI,"Ah me! what wounds I mark'd upon their limbs,"
533,CANTO XVI,"Recent and old, inflicted by the flames!"

535,CANTO XVI,
536,CANTO XVI,"Attentive to their cry my teacher paus'd,"
537,CANTO XVI,"And turn'd to me his visage, and then spake;"
538,CANTO XVI,"""Wait now! our courtesy these merit well:"

541,CANTO XVI,"That haste had better suited thee than them."""
542,CANTO XVI,
543,CANTO XVI,"They, when we stopp'd, resum'd their ancient wail,"
544,CANTO XVI,"And soon as they had reach'd us, all the three"
545,CANTO XVI,Whirl'd round together in one restless wheel.
546,CANTO XVI,"As naked champions, smear'd with slippery oil,"
547,CANTO XVI,Are wont intent to watch their place of hold
548,CANTO XVI,"And vantage, ere in closer strife they meet;"
549,CANTO XVI,"Thus each one, as he wheel'd, his countenance"

557,CANTO XVI,"Incline thee to inform us who thou art,"
558,CANTO XVI,That dost imprint with living feet unharm'd
559,CANTO XVI,"The soil of Hell.  He, in whose track thou see'st"
560,CANTO XVI,"My steps pursuing, naked though he be"

565,CANTO XVI,"Achiev'd, both by his wisdom and his sword."
566,CANTO XVI,"The other, next to me that beats the sand,"
567,CANTO XVI,"Is Aldobrandi, name deserving well,"
568,CANTO XVI,"In the' upper world, of honour; and myself"
569,CANTO XVI,"Who in this torment do partake with them,"
570,CANTO XVI,"Am Rusticucci, whom, past doubt, my wife"

575,CANTO XVI,Would have restrain'd my going; but that fear
576,CANTO XVI,"Of the dire burning vanquish'd the desire,"
577,CANTO XVI,Which made me eager of their wish'd embrace.
578,CANTO XVI,
579,CANTO XVI,"I then began: ""Not scorn, but grief much more,"

595,CANTO XVI,"Dwell in our city, or have vanish'd clean?"
596,CANTO XVI,"For one amidst us late condemn'd to wail,"

605,CANTO XVI,"Look'd at each other, as men look when truth"
606,CANTO XVI,"Comes to their ear.  ""If thou at other times,"""
607,CANTO XVI,"They all at once rejoin'd, ""so easily"

612,CANTO XVI,"When thou with pleasure shalt retrace the past,"
613,CANTO XVI,"See that of us thou speak among mankind."""
614,CANTO XVI,
615,CANTO XVI,"This said, they broke the circle, and so swift"
616,CANTO XVI,"Fled, that as pinions seem'd their nimble feet."
617,CANTO XVI,
618,CANTO XVI,Not in so short a time might one have said
619,CANTO XVI,"""Amen,"" as they had vanish'd. Straight my guide"
620,CANTO XVI,Pursu'd his track.  I follow'd; and small space
621,CANTO XVI,"Had we pass'd onward, when the water's sound"
622,CANTO XVI,"Was now so near at hand, that we had scarce"
623,CANTO XVI,Heard one another's speech for the loud din.
624,CANTO XVI,
625,CANTO XVI,"E'en as the river, that holds on its course"
626,CANTO XVI,"Unmingled, from the mount of Vesulo,"
627,CANTO XVI,"On the left side of Apennine, toward"
628,CANTO XVI,"The east, which Acquacheta higher up"
629,CANTO XVI,"They call, ere it descend into the vale,"
630,CANTO XVI,"At Forli by that name no longer known,"
631,CANTO XVI,"Rebellows o'er Saint Benedict, roll'd on"
632,CANTO XVI,"From the' Alpine summit down a precipice,"
633,CANTO XVI,Where space enough to lodge a thousand spreads;
634,CANTO XVI,"Thus downward from a craggy steep we found,"
635,CANTO XVI,"That this dark wave resounded, roaring loud,"
636,CANTO XVI,So that the ear its clamour soon had stunn'd.
637,CANTO XVI,
638,CANTO XVI,"I had a cord that brac'd my girdle round,"
639,CANTO XVI,Wherewith I erst had thought fast bound to take
640,CANTO XVI,The painted leopard.  This when I had all
641,CANTO XVI,Unloosen'd from me (so my master bade)
642,CANTO XVI,"I gather'd up, and stretch'd it forth to him."
643,CANTO XVI,"Then to the right he turn'd, and from the brink"
644,CANTO XVI,"Standing few paces distant, cast it down"
645,CANTO XVI,"Into the deep abyss.  ""And somewhat strange,"""
646,CANTO XVI,"Thus to myself I spake, ""signal so strange"
647,CANTO XVI,"Betokens, which my guide with earnest eye"
648,CANTO XVI,"Thus follows.""  Ah! what caution must men use"
649,CANTO XVI,"With those who look not at the deed alone,"
650,CANTO XVI,But spy into the thoughts with subtle skill!
651,CANTO XVI,
652,CANTO XVI,"""Quickly shall come,"" he said, ""what I expect,"

655,CANTO XVI,"Which but the semblance of a falsehood wears,"
656,CANTO XVI,"A man, if possible, should bar his lip;"
657,CANTO XVI,"Since, although blameless, he incurs reproach."
658,CANTO XVI,But silence here were vain; and by these notes
659,CANTO XVI,"Which now I sing, reader!  I swear to thee,"
660,CANTO XVI,So may they favour find to latest times!
661,CANTO XVI,That through the gross and murky air I spied
662,CANTO XVI,"A shape come swimming up, that might have quell'd"
663,CANTO XVI,"The stoutest heart with wonder, in such guise"
664,CANTO XVI,"As one returns, who hath been down to loose"
665,CANTO XVI,"An anchor grappled fast against some rock,"
666,CANTO XVI,"Or to aught else that in the salt wave lies,"
667,CANTO XVI,Who upward springing close draws in his feet.

674,CANTO XVII,"""LO! the fell monster with the deadly sting!"
675,CANTO XVII,"Who passes mountains, breaks through fenced walls"
676,CANTO XVII,"And firm embattled spears, and with his filth"
677,CANTO XVII,"Taints all the world!""  Thus me my guide address'd,"
678,CANTO XVII,"And beckon'd him, that he should come to shore,"
679,CANTO XVII,Near to the stony causeway's utmost edge.
680,CANTO XVII,
681,CANTO XVII,"Forthwith that image vile of fraud appear'd,"
682,CANTO XVII,"His head and upper part expos'd on land,"
683,CANTO XVII,But laid not on the shore his bestial train.
684,CANTO XVII,"His face the semblance of a just man's wore,"
685,CANTO XVII,So kind and gracious was its outward cheer;
686,CANTO XVII,The rest was serpent all: two shaggy claws
687,CANTO XVII,"Reach'd to the armpits, and the back and breast,"
688,CANTO XVII,"And either side, were painted o'er with nodes"
689,CANTO XVII,And orbits.  Colours variegated more
690,CANTO XVII,Nor Turks nor Tartars e'er on cloth of state
691,CANTO XVII,"With interchangeable embroidery wove,"
692,CANTO XVII,Nor spread Arachne o'er her curious loom.
693,CANTO XVII,"As ofttimes a light skiff, moor'd to the shore,"
694,CANTO XVII,"Stands part in water, part upon the land;"
695,CANTO XVII,"Or, as where dwells the greedy German boor,"
696,CANTO XVII,The beaver settles watching for his prey;
697,CANTO XVII,"So on the rim, that fenc'd the sand with rock,"
698,CANTO XVII,Sat perch'd the fiend of evil.  In the void
699,CANTO XVII,"Glancing, his tail upturn'd its venomous fork,"
700,CANTO XVII,With sting like scorpion's arm'd.  Then thus my guide:
701,CANTO XVII,"""Now need our way must turn few steps apart,"
702,CANTO XVII,"Far as to that ill beast, who couches there."""
703,CANTO XVII,
704,CANTO XVII,Thereat toward the right our downward course
705,CANTO XVII,"We shap'd, and, better to escape the flame"
706,CANTO XVII,"And burning marle, ten paces on the verge"
707,CANTO XVII,"Proceeded.  Soon as we to him arrive,"
708,CANTO XVII,A little further on mine eye beholds
709,CANTO XVII,"A tribe of spirits, seated on the sand"
710,CANTO XVII,Near the wide chasm.  Forthwith my master spake:
711,CANTO XVII,"""That to the full thy knowledge may extend"
712,CANTO XVII,"Of all this round contains, go now, and mark"
713,CANTO XVII,The mien these wear: but hold not long discourse.
714,CANTO XVII,"Till thou returnest, I with him meantime"
715,CANTO XVII,"Will parley, that to us he may vouchsafe"
716,CANTO XVII,"The aid of his strong shoulders.""  Thus alone"
717,CANTO XVII,Yet forward on the' extremity I pac'd
718,CANTO XVII,"Of that seventh circle, where the mournful tribe"
719,CANTO XVII,Were seated.  At the eyes forth gush'd their pangs.
720,CANTO XVII,Against the vapours and the torrid soil
721,CANTO XVII,Alternately their shifting hands they plied.
722,CANTO XVII,Thus use the dogs in summer still to ply
723,CANTO XVII,"Their jaws and feet by turns, when bitten sore"
724,CANTO XVII,"By gnats, or flies, or gadflies swarming round."
725,CANTO XVII,
726,CANTO XVII,"Noting the visages of some, who lay"
727,CANTO XVII,"Beneath the pelting of that dolorous fire,"
728,CANTO XVII,"One of them all I knew not; but perceiv'd,"
729,CANTO XVII,That pendent from his neck each bore a pouch
730,CANTO XVII,"With colours and with emblems various mark'd,"
731,CANTO XVII,On which it seem'd as if their eye did feed.
732,CANTO XVII,
733,CANTO XVII,"And when amongst them looking round I came,"
734,CANTO XVII,"A yellow purse I saw with azure wrought,"
735,CANTO XVII,That wore a lion's countenance and port.
736,CANTO XVII,"Then still my sight pursuing its career,"
737,CANTO XVII,"Another I beheld, than blood more red."
738,CANTO XVII,A goose display of whiter wing than curd.
739,CANTO XVII,"And one, who bore a fat and azure swine"
740,CANTO XVII,"Pictur'd on his white scrip, addressed me thus:"
741,CANTO XVII,"""What dost thou in this deep?  Go now and know,"
742,CANTO XVII,"Since yet thou livest, that my neighbour here"
743,CANTO XVII,Vitaliano on my left shall sit.
744,CANTO XVII,A Paduan with these Florentines am I.
745,CANTO XVII,"Ofttimes they thunder in mine ears, exclaiming"
746,CANTO XVII,'O haste that noble knight! he who the pouch
747,CANTO XVII,"With the three beaks will bring!'""  This said, he writh'd"
748,CANTO XVII,"The mouth, and loll'd the tongue out, like an ox"
749,CANTO XVII,"That licks his nostrils.  I, lest longer stay"
750,CANTO XVII,"He ill might brook, who bade me stay not long,"
751,CANTO XVII,Backward my steps from those sad spirits turn'd.
752,CANTO XVII,
753,CANTO XVII,My guide already seated on the haunch
754,CANTO XVII,Of the fierce animal I found; and thus
755,CANTO XVII,"He me encourag'd.  ""Be thou stout; be bold."
756,CANTO XVII,Down such a steep flight must we now descend!
757,CANTO XVII,Mount thou before: for that no power the tail
758,CANTO XVII,"May have to harm thee, I will be i' th' midst."""
759,CANTO XVII,
760,CANTO XVII,"As one, who hath an ague fit so near,"
761,CANTO XVII,"His nails already are turn'd blue, and he"
762,CANTO XVII,"Quivers all o'er, if he but eye the shade;"
763,CANTO XVII,Such was my cheer at hearing of his words.
764,CANTO XVII,"But shame soon interpos'd her threat, who makes"
765,CANTO XVII,The servant bold in presence of his lord.
766,CANTO XVII,
767,CANTO XVII,"I settled me upon those shoulders huge,"
768,CANTO XVII,"And would have said, but that the words to aid"
769,CANTO XVII,"My purpose came not, ""Look thou clasp me firm!"""
770,CANTO XVII,
771,CANTO XVII,"But he whose succour then not first I prov'd,"
772,CANTO XVII,"Soon as I mounted, in his arms aloft,"
773,CANTO XVII,"Embracing, held me up, and thus he spake:"
774,CANTO XVII,"""Geryon! now move thee! be thy wheeling gyres"
775,CANTO XVII,"Of ample circuit, easy thy descent."
776,CANTO XVII,"Think on th' unusual burden thou sustain'st."""
777,CANTO XVII,
778,CANTO XVII,"As a small vessel, back'ning out from land,"
779,CANTO XVII,"Her station quits; so thence the monster loos'd,"
780,CANTO XVII,"And when he felt himself at large, turn'd round"
781,CANTO XVII,"There where the breast had been, his forked tail."
782,CANTO XVII,"Thus, like an eel, outstretch'd at length he steer'd,"
783,CANTO XVII,Gath'ring the air up with retractile claws.
784,CANTO XVII,
785,CANTO XVII,Not greater was the dread when Phaeton
786,CANTO XVII,"The reins let drop at random, whence high heaven,"
787,CANTO XVII,"Whereof signs yet appear, was wrapt in flames;"
788,CANTO XVII,"Nor when ill-fated Icarus perceiv'd,"
789,CANTO XVII,"By liquefaction of the scalded wax,"
790,CANTO XVII,"The trusted pennons loosen'd from his loins,"
791,CANTO XVII,"His sire exclaiming loud, ""Ill way thou keep'st!"""
792,CANTO XVII,"Than was my dread, when round me on each part"
793,CANTO XVII,"The air I view'd, and other object none"
794,CANTO XVII,"Save the fell beast.  He slowly sailing, wheels"
795,CANTO XVII,"His downward motion, unobserv'd of me,"
796,CANTO XVII,"But that the wind, arising to my face,"
797,CANTO XVII,Breathes on me from below.  Now on our right
798,CANTO XVII,I heard the cataract beneath us leap
799,CANTO XVII,"With hideous crash; whence bending down to' explore,"
800,CANTO XVII,New terror I conceiv'd at the steep plunge:
801,CANTO XVII,
802,CANTO XVII,"For flames I saw, and wailings smote mine ear:"
803,CANTO XVII,"So that all trembling close I crouch'd my limbs,"
804,CANTO XVII,"And then distinguish'd, unperceiv'd before,"
805,CANTO XVII,By the dread torments that on every side
806,CANTO XVII,"Drew nearer, how our downward course we wound."
807,CANTO XVII,
808,CANTO XVII,"As falcon, that hath long been on the wing,"
809,CANTO XVII,"But lure nor bird hath seen, while in despair"
810,CANTO XVII,"The falconer cries, ""Ah me! thou stoop'st to earth!"""
811,CANTO XVII,"Wearied descends, and swiftly down the sky"
812,CANTO XVII,"In many an orbit wheels, then lighting sits"
813,CANTO XVII,At distance from his lord in angry mood;
814,CANTO XVII,So Geryon lighting places us on foot
815,CANTO XVII,"Low down at base of the deep-furrow'd rock,"
816,CANTO XVII,"And, of his burden there discharg'd, forthwith"
817,CANTO XVII,"Sprang forward, like an arrow from the string."

858,CANTO XVIII,THERE is a place within the depths of hell
859,CANTO XVIII,"Call'd Malebolge, all of rock dark-stain'd"
860,CANTO XVIII,"With hue ferruginous, e'en as the steep"
861,CANTO XVIII,That round it circling winds.  Right in the midst
862,CANTO XVIII,"Of that abominable region, yawns"
863,CANTO XVIII,"A spacious gulf profound, whereof the frame"
864,CANTO XVIII,"Due time shall tell.  The circle, that remains,"
865,CANTO XVIII,"Throughout its round, between the gulf and base"
866,CANTO XVIII,"Of the high craggy banks, successive forms"
867,CANTO XVIII,"Ten trenches, in its hollow bottom sunk."
868,CANTO XVIII,
869,CANTO XVIII,"As where to guard the walls, full many a foss"
870,CANTO XVIII,"Begirds some stately castle, sure defence"
871,CANTO XVIII,"Affording to the space within, so here"
872,CANTO XVIII,Were model'd these; and as like fortresses
873,CANTO XVIII,"E'en from their threshold to the brink without,"
874,CANTO XVIII,Are flank'd with bridges; from the rock's low base
875,CANTO XVIII,"Thus flinty paths advanc'd, that 'cross the moles"
876,CANTO XVIII,"And dikes, struck onward far as to the gulf,"
877,CANTO XVIII,That in one bound collected cuts them off.
878,CANTO XVIII,"Such was the place, wherein we found ourselves"
879,CANTO XVIII,From Geryon's back dislodg'd. The bard to left
880,CANTO XVIII,"Held on his way, and I behind him mov'd."
881,CANTO XVIII,
882,CANTO XVIII,"On our right hand new misery I saw,"
883,CANTO XVIII,"New pains, new executioners of wrath,"
884,CANTO XVIII,That swarming peopled the first chasm.  Below
885,CANTO XVIII,"Were naked sinners.  Hitherward they came,"
886,CANTO XVIII,"Meeting our faces from the middle point,"
887,CANTO XVIII,With us beyond but with a larger stride.
888,CANTO XVIII,"E'en thus the Romans, when the year returns"
889,CANTO XVIII,"Of Jubilee, with better speed to rid"
890,CANTO XVIII,"The thronging multitudes, their means devise"
891,CANTO XVIII,For such as pass the bridge; that on one side
892,CANTO XVIII,"All front toward the castle, and approach"
893,CANTO XVIII,"Saint Peter's fane, on th' other towards the mount."
894,CANTO XVIII,
895,CANTO XVIII,"Each divers way along the grisly rock,"
896,CANTO XVIII,"Horn'd demons I beheld, with lashes huge,"
897,CANTO XVIII,That on their back unmercifully smote.
898,CANTO XVIII,Ah! how they made them bound at the first stripe!
899,CANTO XVIII,
900,CANTO XVIII,None for the second waited nor the third.
901,CANTO XVIII,
902,CANTO XVIII,"Meantime as on I pass'd, one met my sight"
903,CANTO XVIII,"Whom soon as view'd; ""Of him,"" cried I, ""not yet"
904,CANTO XVIII,"Mine eye hath had his fill.""  With fixed gaze"
905,CANTO XVIII,I therefore scann'd him.  Straight the teacher kind
906,CANTO XVIII,"Paus'd with me, and consented I should walk"
907,CANTO XVIII,"Backward a space, and the tormented spirit,"
908,CANTO XVIII,"Who thought to hide him, bent his visage down."
909,CANTO XVIII,But it avail'd him nought; for I exclaim'd:
910,CANTO XVIII,"""Thou who dost cast thy eye upon the ground,"
911,CANTO XVIII,"Unless thy features do belie thee much,"
912,CANTO XVIII,Venedico art thou.  But what brings thee
913,CANTO XVIII,"Into this bitter seas'ning?"" He replied:"
914,CANTO XVIII,"""Unwillingly I answer to thy words."
915,CANTO XVIII,"But thy clear speech, that to my mind recalls"
916,CANTO XVIII,"The world I once inhabited, constrains me."
917,CANTO XVIII,Know then 'twas I who led fair Ghisola
918,CANTO XVIII,"To do the Marquis' will, however fame"
919,CANTO XVIII,The shameful tale have bruited.  Nor alone
920,CANTO XVIII,Bologna hither sendeth me to mourn
921,CANTO XVIII,Rather with us the place is so o'erthrong'd
922,CANTO XVIII,"That not so many tongues this day are taught,"
923,CANTO XVIII,"Betwixt the Reno and Savena's stream,"
924,CANTO XVIII,To answer SIPA in their country's phrase.
925,CANTO XVIII,"And if of that securer proof thou need,"
926,CANTO XVIII,"Remember but our craving thirst for gold."""
927,CANTO XVIII,
928,CANTO XVIII,"Him speaking thus, a demon with his thong"
929,CANTO XVIII,"Struck, and exclaim'd, ""Away! corrupter! here"
930,CANTO XVIII,"Women are none for sale.""  Forthwith I join'd"
931,CANTO XVIII,"My escort, and few paces thence we came"
932,CANTO XVIII,To where a rock forth issued from the bank.
933,CANTO XVIII,"That easily ascended, to the right"
934,CANTO XVIII,"Upon its splinter turning, we depart"
935,CANTO XVIII,"From those eternal barriers. When arriv'd,"
936,CANTO XVIII,Where underneath the gaping arch lets pass
937,CANTO XVIII,"The scourged souls: ""Pause here,"" the teacher said,"
938,CANTO XVIII,"""And let these others miserable, now"
939,CANTO XVIII,"Strike on thy ken, faces not yet beheld,"
940,CANTO XVIII,"For that together they with us have walk'd."""
941,CANTO XVIII,
942,CANTO XVIII,"From the old bridge we ey'd the pack, who came"
943,CANTO XVIII,"From th' other side towards us, like the rest,"
944,CANTO XVIII,"Excoriate from the lash.  My gentle guide,"
945,CANTO XVIII,"By me unquestion'd, thus his speech resum'd:"
946,CANTO XVIII,"""Behold that lofty shade, who this way tends,"
947,CANTO XVIII,And seems too woe-begone to drop a tear.
948,CANTO XVIII,How yet the regal aspect he retains!
949,CANTO XVIII,"Jason is he, whose skill and prowess won"
950,CANTO XVIII,The ram from Colchos. To the Lemnian isle
951,CANTO XVIII,"His passage thither led him, when those bold"
952,CANTO XVIII,And pitiless women had slain all their males.
953,CANTO XVIII,There he with tokens and fair witching words
954,CANTO XVIII,"Hypsipyle beguil'd, a virgin young,"
955,CANTO XVIII,Who first had all the rest herself beguil'd.
956,CANTO XVIII,Impregnated he left her there forlorn.
957,CANTO XVIII,Such is the guilt condemns him to this pain.
958,CANTO XVIII,Here too Medea's inj'ries are avenged.
959,CANTO XVIII,"All bear him company, who like deceit"
960,CANTO XVIII,To his have practis'd.  And thus much to know
961,CANTO XVIII,"Of the first vale suffice thee, and of those"
962,CANTO XVIII,"Whom its keen torments urge.""  Now had we come"
963,CANTO XVIII,"Where, crossing the next pier, the straighten'd path"
964,CANTO XVIII,Bestrides its shoulders to another arch.
965,CANTO XVIII,
966,CANTO XVIII,"Hence in the second chasm we heard the ghosts,"
967,CANTO XVIII,"Who jibber in low melancholy sounds,"
968,CANTO XVIII,"With wide-stretch'd nostrils snort, and on themselves"
969,CANTO XVIII,Smite with their palms.  Upon the banks a scurf
970,CANTO XVIII,"From the foul steam condens'd, encrusting hung,"
971,CANTO XVIII,That held sharp combat with the sight and smell.
972,CANTO XVIII,
973,CANTO XVIII,"So hollow is the depth, that from no part,"
974,CANTO XVIII,"Save on the summit of the rocky span,"
975,CANTO XVIII,Could I distinguish aught.  Thus far we came;
976,CANTO XVIII,"And thence I saw, within the foss below,"
977,CANTO XVIII,"A crowd immers'd in ordure, that appear'd"
978,CANTO XVIII,Draff of the human body.  There beneath
979,CANTO XVIII,"Searching with eye inquisitive, I mark'd"
980,CANTO XVIII,"One with his head so grim'd, 't were hard to deem,"
981,CANTO XVIII,If he were clerk or layman.  Loud he cried:
982,CANTO XVIII,"""Why greedily thus bendest more on me,"
983,CANTO XVIII,"Than on these other filthy ones, thy ken?"""
984,CANTO XVIII,
985,CANTO XVIII,"""Because if true my mem'ry,"" I replied,"
986,CANTO XVIII,"""I heretofore have seen thee with dry locks,"
987,CANTO XVIII,And thou Alessio art of Lucca sprung.
988,CANTO XVIII,"Therefore than all the rest I scan thee more."""
989,CANTO XVIII,
990,CANTO XVIII,Then beating on his brain these words he spake:
991,CANTO XVIII,"""Me thus low down my flatteries have sunk,"
992,CANTO XVIII,"Wherewith I ne'er enough could glut my tongue."""
993,CANTO XVIII,
994,CANTO XVIII,"My leader thus: ""A little further stretch"
995,CANTO XVIII,"Thy face, that thou the visage well mayst note"
996,CANTO XVIII,"Of that besotted, sluttish courtezan,"
997,CANTO XVIII,"Who there doth rend her with defiled nails,"
998,CANTO XVIII,"Now crouching down, now risen on her feet."
999,CANTO XVIII,
1000,CANTO XVIII,"""Thais is this, the harlot, whose false lip"
1001,CANTO XVIII,"Answer'd her doting paramour that ask'd,"
1002,CANTO XVIII,"'Thankest me much!'--'Say rather wondrously,'"
1003,CANTO XVIII,"And seeing this here satiate be our view."""
1004,CANTO XVIII,
1005,CANTO XVIII,
1006,CANTO XVIII,
1007,CANTO XVIII,
1008,CANTO XIX,CANTO XIX
1009,CANTO XIX,
1010,CANTO XIX,"WOE to thee, Simon Magus! woe to you,"
1011,CANTO XIX,"His wretched followers! who the things of God,"
1012,CANTO XIX,"Which should be wedded unto goodness, them,"
1013,CANTO XIX,"Rapacious as ye are, do prostitute"
1014,CANTO XIX,For gold and silver in adultery!
1015,CANTO XIX,"Now must the trumpet sound for you, since yours"
1016,CANTO XIX,Is the third chasm.  Upon the following vault
1017,CANTO XIX,"We now had mounted, where the rock impends"
1018,CANTO XIX,Directly o'er the centre of the foss.
1019,CANTO XIX,
1020,CANTO XIX,"Wisdom Supreme! how wonderful the art,"
1021,CANTO XIX,"Which thou dost manifest in heaven, in earth,"
1022,CANTO XIX,"And in the evil world, how just a meed"
1023,CANTO XIX,Allotting by thy virtue unto all!
1024,CANTO XIX,
1025,CANTO XIX,"I saw the livid stone, throughout the sides"
1026,CANTO XIX,"And in its bottom full of apertures,"
1027,CANTO XIX,"All equal in their width, and circular each,"
1028,CANTO XIX,Nor ample less nor larger they appear'd
1029,CANTO XIX,Than in Saint John's fair dome of me belov'd
1030,CANTO XIX,"Those fram'd to hold the pure baptismal streams,"
1031,CANTO XIX,"One of the which I brake, some few years past,"
1032,CANTO XIX,To save a whelming infant; and be this
1033,CANTO XIX,A seal to undeceive whoever doubts
1034,CANTO XIX,The motive of my deed.  From out the mouth
1035,CANTO XIX,"Of every one, emerg'd a sinner's feet"
1036,CANTO XIX,And of the legs high upward as the calf
1037,CANTO XIX,The rest beneath was hid.  On either foot
1038,CANTO XIX,"The soles were burning, whence the flexile joints"
1039,CANTO XIX,"Glanc'd with such violent motion, as had snapt"
1040,CANTO XIX,"Asunder cords or twisted withs.  As flame,"
1041,CANTO XIX,"Feeding on unctuous matter, glides along"
1042,CANTO XIX,"The surface, scarcely touching where it moves;"
1043,CANTO XIX,"So here, from heel to point, glided the flames."
1044,CANTO XIX,
1045,CANTO XIX,"""Master! say who is he, than all the rest"
1046,CANTO XIX,"Glancing in fiercer agony, on whom"
1047,CANTO XIX,"A ruddier flame doth prey?""  I thus inquir'd."
1048,CANTO XIX,
1049,CANTO XIX,"""If thou be willing,"" he replied, ""that I"
1050,CANTO XIX,"Carry thee down, where least the slope bank falls,"
1051,CANTO XIX,"He of himself shall tell thee and his wrongs."""
1052,CANTO XIX,
1053,CANTO XIX,"I then: ""As pleases thee to me is best."
1054,CANTO XIX,Thou art my lord; and know'st that ne'er I quit
1055,CANTO XIX,"Thy will: what silence hides that knowest thou."""
1056,CANTO XIX,"Thereat on the fourth pier we came, we turn'd,"
1057,CANTO XIX,"And on our left descended to the depth,"
1058,CANTO XIX,A narrow strait and perforated close.
1059,CANTO XIX,"Nor from his side my leader set me down,"
1060,CANTO XIX,"Till to his orifice he brought, whose limb"
1061,CANTO XIX,"Quiv'ring express'd his pang.  ""Whoe'er thou art,"
1062,CANTO XIX,"Sad spirit! thus revers'd, and as a stake"
1063,CANTO XIX,"Driv'n in the soil!""  I in these words began,"
1064,CANTO XIX,"""If thou be able, utter forth thy voice."""
1065,CANTO XIX,
1066,CANTO XIX,"There stood I like the friar, that doth shrive"
1067,CANTO XIX,"A wretch for murder doom'd, who e'en when fix'd,"
1068,CANTO XIX,"Calleth him back, whence death awhile delays."
1069,CANTO XIX,
1070,CANTO XIX,"He shouted: ""Ha! already standest there?"
1071,CANTO XIX,"Already standest there, O Boniface!"
1072,CANTO XIX,By many a year the writing play'd me false.
1073,CANTO XIX,"So early dost thou surfeit with the wealth,"
1074,CANTO XIX,For which thou fearedst not in guile to take
1075,CANTO XIX,"The lovely lady, and then mangle her?"""
1076,CANTO XIX,
1077,CANTO XIX,"I felt as those who, piercing not the drift"
1078,CANTO XIX,"Of answer made them, stand as if expos'd"
1079,CANTO XIX,"In mockery, nor know what to reply,"
1080,CANTO XIX,"When Virgil thus admonish'd: ""Tell him quick,"
1081,CANTO XIX,"I am not he, not he, whom thou believ'st."""
1082,CANTO XIX,
1083,CANTO XIX,"And I, as was enjoin'd me, straight replied."
1084,CANTO XIX,
1085,CANTO XIX,"That heard, the spirit all did wrench his feet,"
1086,CANTO XIX,And sighing next in woeful accent spake:
1087,CANTO XIX,"""What then of me requirest?  If to know"
1088,CANTO XIX,"So much imports thee, who I am, that thou"
1089,CANTO XIX,"Hast therefore down the bank descended, learn"
1090,CANTO XIX,"That in the mighty mantle I was rob'd,"
1091,CANTO XIX,"And of a she-bear was indeed the son,"
1092,CANTO XIX,"So eager to advance my whelps, that there"
1093,CANTO XIX,"My having in my purse above I stow'd,"
1094,CANTO XIX,And here myself.  Under my head are dragg'd
1095,CANTO XIX,"The rest, my predecessors in the guilt"
1096,CANTO XIX,Of simony.  Stretch'd at their length they lie
1097,CANTO XIX,Along an opening in the rock.  'Midst them
1098,CANTO XIX,"I also low shall fall, soon as he comes,"
1099,CANTO XIX,"For whom I took thee, when so hastily"
1100,CANTO XIX,I question'd.  But already longer time
1101,CANTO XIX,"Hath pass'd, since my souls kindled, and I thus"
1102,CANTO XIX,"Upturn'd have stood, than is his doom to stand"
1103,CANTO XIX,"Planted with fiery feet.  For after him,"
1104,CANTO XIX,"One yet of deeds more ugly shall arrive,"
1105,CANTO XIX,"From forth the west, a shepherd without law,"
1106,CANTO XIX,Fated to cover both his form and mine.
1107,CANTO XIX,"He a new Jason shall be call'd, of whom"
1108,CANTO XIX,In Maccabees we read; and favour such
1109,CANTO XIX,"As to that priest his king indulgent show'd,"
1110,CANTO XIX,"Shall be of France's monarch shown to him."""
1111,CANTO XIX,
1112,CANTO XIX,"I know not if I here too far presum'd,"
1113,CANTO XIX,"But in this strain I answer'd: ""Tell me now,"
1114,CANTO XIX,What treasures from St. Peter at the first
1115,CANTO XIX,"Our Lord demanded, when he put the keys"
1116,CANTO XIX,Into his charge?  Surely he ask'd no more
1117,CANTO XIX,"But, Follow me!  Nor Peter nor the rest"
1118,CANTO XIX,"Or gold or silver of Matthias took,"
1119,CANTO XIX,When lots were cast upon the forfeit place
1120,CANTO XIX,Of the condemned soul.  Abide thou then;
1121,CANTO XIX,Thy punishment of right is merited:
1122,CANTO XIX,"And look thou well to that ill-gotten coin,"
1123,CANTO XIX,Which against Charles thy hardihood inspir'd.
1124,CANTO XIX,"If reverence of the keys restrain'd me not,"
1125,CANTO XIX,"Which thou in happier time didst hold, I yet"
1126,CANTO XIX,Severer speech might use.  Your avarice
1127,CANTO XIX,"O'ercasts the world with mourning, under foot"
1128,CANTO XIX,"Treading the good, and raising bad men up."
1129,CANTO XIX,"Of shepherds, like to you, th' Evangelist"
1130,CANTO XIX,"Was ware, when her, who sits upon the waves,"
1131,CANTO XIX,"With kings in filthy whoredom he beheld,"
1132,CANTO XIX,"She who with seven heads tower'd at her birth,"
1133,CANTO XIX,"And from ten horns her proof of glory drew,"
1134,CANTO XIX,Long as her spouse in virtue took delight.
1135,CANTO XIX,"Of gold and silver ye have made your god,"
1136,CANTO XIX,"Diff'ring wherein from the idolater,"
1137,CANTO XIX,"But he that worships one, a hundred ye?"
1138,CANTO XIX,"Ah, Constantine! to how much ill gave birth,"
1139,CANTO XIX,"Not thy conversion, but that plenteous dower,"
1140,CANTO XIX,"Which the first wealthy Father gain'd from thee!"""
1141,CANTO XIX,
1142,CANTO XIX,"Meanwhile, as thus I sung, he, whether wrath"
1143,CANTO XIX,"Or conscience smote him, violent upsprang"
1144,CANTO XIX,Spinning on either sole.  I do believe
1145,CANTO XIX,"My teacher well was pleas'd, with so compos'd"
1146,CANTO XIX,"A lip, he listen'd ever to the sound"
1147,CANTO XIX,Of the true words I utter'd.  In both arms
1148,CANTO XIX,"He caught, and to his bosom lifting me"
1149,CANTO XIX,Upward retrac'd the way of his descent.
1150,CANTO XIX,
1151,CANTO XIX,"Nor weary of his weight he press'd me close,"
1152,CANTO XIX,"Till to the summit of the rock we came,"
1153,CANTO XIX,Our passage from the fourth to the fifth pier.
1154,CANTO XIX,His cherish'd burden there gently he plac'd
1155,CANTO XIX,"Upon the rugged rock and steep, a path"
1156,CANTO XIX,Not easy for the clamb'ring goat to mount.
1157,CANTO XIX,
1158,CANTO XIX,Thence to my view another vale appear'd
1159,CANTO XIX,
1160,CANTO XIX,
1161,CANTO XIX,
1162,CANTO XIX,
1163,CANTO XX,CANTO XX
1164,CANTO XX,
1165,CANTO XX,"AND now the verse proceeds to torments new,"
1166,CANTO XX,Fit argument of this the twentieth strain
1167,CANTO XX,"Of the first song, whose awful theme records"
1168,CANTO XX,The spirits whelm'd in woe.  Earnest I look'd
1169,CANTO XX,"Into the depth, that open'd to my view,"
1170,CANTO XX,"Moisten'd with tears of anguish, and beheld"
1171,CANTO XX,"A tribe, that came along the hollow vale,"
1172,CANTO XX,In silence weeping: such their step as walk
1173,CANTO XX,Quires chanting solemn litanies on earth.
1174,CANTO XX,
1175,CANTO XX,"As on them more direct mine eye descends,"
1176,CANTO XX,Each wondrously seem'd to be revers'd
1177,CANTO XX,"At the neck-bone, so that the countenance"
1178,CANTO XX,Was from the reins averted: and because
1179,CANTO XX,"None might before him look, they were compell'd"
1180,CANTO XX,To' advance with backward gait.  Thus one perhaps
1181,CANTO XX,"Hath been by force of palsy clean transpos'd,"
1182,CANTO XX,But I ne'er saw it nor believe it so.
1183,CANTO XX,
1184,CANTO XX,"Now, reader! think within thyself, so God"
1185,CANTO XX,Fruit of thy reading give thee! how I long
1186,CANTO XX,"Could keep my visage dry, when I beheld"
1187,CANTO XX,"Near me our form distorted in such guise,"
1188,CANTO XX,That on the hinder parts fall'n from the face
1189,CANTO XX,The tears down-streaming roll'd.  Against a rock
1190,CANTO XX,"I leant and wept, so that my guide exclaim'd:"
1191,CANTO XX,"""What, and art thou too witless as the rest?"
1192,CANTO XX,"Here pity most doth show herself alive,"
1193,CANTO XX,"When she is dead.  What guilt exceedeth his,"
1194,CANTO XX,Who with Heaven's judgment in his passion strives?
1195,CANTO XX,"Raise up thy head, raise up, and see the man,"
1196,CANTO XX,"Before whose eyes earth gap'd in Thebes, when all"
1197,CANTO XX,"Cried out, 'Amphiaraus, whither rushest?"
1198,CANTO XX,'Why leavest thou the war?'  He not the less
1199,CANTO XX,"Fell ruining far as to Minos down,"
1200,CANTO XX,Whose grapple none eludes.  Lo! how he makes
1201,CANTO XX,"The breast his shoulders, and who once too far"
1202,CANTO XX,"Before him wish'd to see, now backward looks,"
1203,CANTO XX,"And treads reverse his path.  Tiresias note,"
1204,CANTO XX,"Who semblance chang'd, when woman he became"
1205,CANTO XX,"Of male, through every limb transform'd, and then"
1206,CANTO XX,Once more behov'd him with his rod to strike
1207,CANTO XX,"The two entwining serpents, ere the plumes,"
1208,CANTO XX,"That mark'd the better sex, might shoot again."
1209,CANTO XX,
1210,CANTO XX,"""Aruns, with more his belly facing, comes."
1211,CANTO XX,"On Luni's mountains 'midst the marbles white,"
1212,CANTO XX,"Where delves Carrara's hind, who wons beneath,"
1213,CANTO XX,"A cavern was his dwelling, whence the stars"
1214,CANTO XX,And main-sea wide in boundless view he held.

1216,CANTO XX,"""The next, whose loosen'd tresses overspread"
1217,CANTO XX,"Her bosom, which thou seest not (for each hair"
1218,CANTO XX,"On that side grows) was Manto, she who search'd"
1219,CANTO XX,"Through many regions, and at length her seat"
1220,CANTO XX,"Fix'd in my native land, whence a short space"
1221,CANTO XX,My words detain thy audience.  When her sire
1222,CANTO XX,"From life departed, and in servitude"
1223,CANTO XX,"The city dedicate to Bacchus mourn'd,"
1224,CANTO XX,Long time she went a wand'rer through the world.
1225,CANTO XX,Aloft in Italy's delightful land
1226,CANTO XX,"A lake there lies, at foot of that proud Alp,"
1227,CANTO XX,"That o'er the Tyrol locks Germania in,"
1228,CANTO XX,"Its name Benacus, which a thousand rills,"
1229,CANTO XX,"Methinks, and more, water between the vale"
1230,CANTO XX,Camonica and Garda and the height
1231,CANTO XX,Of Apennine remote.  There is a spot
1232,CANTO XX,"At midway of that lake, where he who bears"
1233,CANTO XX,"Of Trento's flock the past'ral staff, with him"
1234,CANTO XX,"Of Brescia, and the Veronese, might each"
1235,CANTO XX,Passing that way his benediction give.
1236,CANTO XX,A garrison of goodly site and strong
1237,CANTO XX,"Peschiera stands, to awe with front oppos'd"
1238,CANTO XX,"The Bergamese and Brescian, whence the shore"

1240,CANTO XX,"Benacus' bosom holds not, tumbling o'er"
1241,CANTO XX,"Down falls, and winds a river flood beneath"
1242,CANTO XX,Through the green pastures.  Soon as in his course
1243,CANTO XX,"The steam makes head, Benacus then no more"
1244,CANTO XX,"They call the name, but Mincius, till at last"
1245,CANTO XX,Reaching Governo into Po he falls.
1246,CANTO XX,"Not far his course hath run, when a wide flat"
1247,CANTO XX,"It finds, which overstretchmg as a marsh"
1248,CANTO XX,"It covers, pestilent in summer oft."
1249,CANTO XX,"Hence journeying, the savage maiden saw"
1250,CANTO XX,'Midst of the fen a territory waste

1260,CANTO XX,"Nor ask'd another omen for the name,"
1261,CANTO XX,"Wherein more numerous the people dwelt,"
1262,CANTO XX,Ere Casalodi's madness by deceit
1263,CANTO XX,Was wrong'd of Pinamonte.  If thou hear

1278,CANTO XX,"The cradles were supplied, the seer was he"
1279,CANTO XX,"In Aulis, who with Calchas gave the sign"
1280,CANTO XX,When first to cut the cable.  Him they nam'd
1281,CANTO XX,"Eurypilus: so sings my tragic strain,"
1282,CANTO XX,"In which majestic measure well thou know'st,"
1283,CANTO XX,"Who know'st it all.  That other, round the loins"

1339,CANTO XXI,"In act how bitter did he seem, with wings"
1340,CANTO XXI,Buoyant outstretch'd and feet of nimblest tread!
1341,CANTO XXI,His shoulder proudly eminent and sharp
1342,CANTO XXI,Was with a sinner charg'd; by either haunch

1357,CANTO XXI,"Cried ""Here the hallow'd visage saves not: here"

1361,CANTO XXI,"They grappled him with more than hundred hooks,"

1409,CANTO XXI,"Thus issuing from Caprona, once I saw"
1410,CANTO XXI,"Th' infantry dreading, lest his covenant"

1423,CANTO XXI,"He added: ""Further footing to your step"

1557,CANTO XXII,"Committed to his keeping, play'd the part"
1558,CANTO XXII,Of barterer to the height:  with him doth herd
1559,CANTO XXII,"The chief of Logodoro, Michel Zanche."
1560,CANTO XXII,"Sardinia is a theme, whereof their tongue"
1561,CANTO XXII,Is never weary.  Out! alas! behold
1562,CANTO XXII,"That other, how he grins!  More would I say,"
1563,CANTO XXII,"But tremble lest he mean to maul me sore."""
1564,CANTO XXII,
1565,CANTO XXII,"Their captain then to Farfarello turning,"
1566,CANTO XXII,"Who roll'd his moony eyes in act to strike,"
1567,CANTO XXII,"Rebuk'd him thus: ""Off! cursed bird!  Avaunt!""--"
1568,CANTO XXII,
1569,CANTO XXII,"""If ye desire to see or hear,"" he thus"
1570,CANTO XXII,"Quaking with dread resum'd, ""or Tuscan spirits"
1571,CANTO XXII,"Or Lombard, I will cause them to appear."
1572,CANTO XXII,"Meantime let these ill talons bate their fury,"
1573,CANTO XXII,"So that no vengeance they may fear from them,"
1574,CANTO XXII,"And I, remaining in this self-same place,"
1575,CANTO XXII,"Will for myself but one, make sev'n appear,"
1576,CANTO XXII,When my shrill whistle shall be heard; for so
1577,CANTO XXII,"Our custom is to call each other up."""
1578,CANTO XXII,
1579,CANTO XXII,"Cagnazzo at that word deriding grinn'd,"
1580,CANTO XXII,"Then wagg'd the head and spake: ""Hear his device,"
1581,CANTO XXII,"Mischievous as he is, to plunge him down."""
1582,CANTO XXII,
1583,CANTO XXII,"Whereto he thus, who fail'd not in rich store"
1584,CANTO XXII,"Of nice-wove toils; ""Mischief forsooth extreme,"
1585,CANTO XXII,"Meant only to procure myself more woe!"""
1586,CANTO XXII,
1587,CANTO XXII,"No longer Alichino then refrain'd,"
1588,CANTO XXII,"But thus, the rest gainsaying, him bespake:"
1589,CANTO XXII,"""If thou do cast thee down, I not on foot"
1590,CANTO XXII,"Will chase thee, but above the pitch will beat"
1591,CANTO XXII,"My plumes.  Quit we the vantage ground, and let"
1592,CANTO XXII,"The bank be as a shield, that we may see"
1593,CANTO XXII,"If singly thou prevail against us all."""
1594,CANTO XXII,
1595,CANTO XXII,"Now, reader, of new sport expect to hear!"
1596,CANTO XXII,
1597,CANTO XXII,"They each one turn'd his eyes to the' other shore,"
1598,CANTO XXII,"He first, who was the hardest to persuade."
1599,CANTO XXII,"The spirit of Navarre chose well his time,"
1600,CANTO XXII,"Planted his feet on land, and at one leap"
1601,CANTO XXII,Escaping disappointed their resolve.
1602,CANTO XXII,
1603,CANTO XXII,"Them quick resentment stung, but him the most,"
1604,CANTO XXII,Who was the cause of failure; in pursuit
1605,CANTO XXII,"He therefore sped, exclaiming; ""Thou art caught."""
1606,CANTO XXII,
1607,CANTO XXII,But little it avail'd: terror outstripp'd
1608,CANTO XXII,"His following flight: the other plung'd beneath,"
1609,CANTO XXII,And he with upward pinion rais'd his breast:
1610,CANTO XXII,"E'en thus the water-fowl, when she perceives"
1611,CANTO XXII,"The falcon near, dives instant down, while he"
1612,CANTO XXII,Enrag'd and spent retires.  That mockery
1613,CANTO XXII,"In Calcabrina fury stirr'd, who flew"
1614,CANTO XXII,"After him, with desire of strife inflam'd;"
1615,CANTO XXII,"And, for the barterer had 'scap'd, so turn'd"
1616,CANTO XXII,His talons on his comrade. O'er the dyke
1617,CANTO XXII,In grapple close they join'd; but the' other prov'd
1618,CANTO XXII,A goshawk able to rend well his foe;
1619,CANTO XXII,
1620,CANTO XXII,And in the boiling lake both fell.  The heat
1621,CANTO XXII,"Was umpire soon between them, but in vain"
1622,CANTO XXII,"To lift themselves they strove, so fast were glued"
1623,CANTO XXII,"Their pennons.  Barbariccia, as the rest,"
1624,CANTO XXII,"That chance lamenting, four in flight dispatch'd"
1625,CANTO XXII,"From the' other coast, with all their weapons arm'd."
1626,CANTO XXII,"They, to their post on each side speedily"
1627,CANTO XXII,"Descending, stretch'd their hooks toward the fiends,"
1628,CANTO XXII,"Who flounder'd, inly burning from their scars:"
1629,CANTO XXII,And we departing left them to that broil.

1670,CANTO XXIII,"IN silence and in solitude we went,"
1671,CANTO XXIII,"One first, the other following his steps,"
1672,CANTO XXIII,As minor friars journeying on their road.
1673,CANTO XXIII,
1674,CANTO XXIII,The present fray had turn'd my thoughts to muse
1675,CANTO XXIII,"Upon old Aesop's fable, where he told"
1676,CANTO XXIII,What fate unto the mouse and frog befell.
1677,CANTO XXIII,"For language hath not sounds more like in sense,"
1678,CANTO XXIII,"Than are these chances, if the origin"
1679,CANTO XXIII,And end of each be heedfully compar'd.
1680,CANTO XXIII,"And as one thought bursts from another forth,"
1681,CANTO XXIII,"So afterward from that another sprang,"
1682,CANTO XXIII,Which added doubly to my former fear.
1683,CANTO XXIII,"For thus I reason'd: ""These through us have been"
1684,CANTO XXIII,"So foil'd, with loss and mock'ry so complete,"
1685,CANTO XXIII,As needs must sting them sore.  If anger then
1686,CANTO XXIII,"Be to their evil will conjoin'd, more fell"
1687,CANTO XXIII,"They shall pursue us, than the savage hound"
1688,CANTO XXIII,"Snatches the leveret, panting 'twixt his jaws."""
1689,CANTO XXIII,
1690,CANTO XXIII,Already I perceiv'd my hair stand all
1691,CANTO XXIII,"On end with terror, and look'd eager back."
1692,CANTO XXIII,
1693,CANTO XXIII,"""Teacher,"" I thus began, ""if speedily"
1694,CANTO XXIII,"Thyself and me thou hide not, much I dread"
1695,CANTO XXIII,Those evil talons.  Even now behind
1696,CANTO XXIII,They urge us: quick imagination works
1697,CANTO XXIII,"So forcibly, that I already feel them."""
1698,CANTO XXIII,
1699,CANTO XXIII,"He answer'd: ""Were I form'd of leaded glass,"
1700,CANTO XXIII,I should not sooner draw unto myself
1701,CANTO XXIII,"Thy outward image, than I now imprint"
1702,CANTO XXIII,That from within.  This moment came thy thoughts
1703,CANTO XXIII,"Presented before mine, with similar act"
1704,CANTO XXIII,"And count'nance similar, so that from both"
1705,CANTO XXIII,I one design have fram'd.  If the right coast
1706,CANTO XXIII,"Incline so much, that we may thence descend"
1707,CANTO XXIII,"Into the other chasm, we shall escape"
1708,CANTO XXIII,"Secure from this imagined pursuit."""
1709,CANTO XXIII,
1710,CANTO XXIII,"He had not spoke his purpose to the end,"
1711,CANTO XXIII,When I from far beheld them with spread wings
1712,CANTO XXIII,Approach to take us.  Suddenly my guide
1713,CANTO XXIII,"Caught me, ev'n as a mother that from sleep"
1714,CANTO XXIII,"Is by the noise arous'd, and near her sees"
1715,CANTO XXIII,"The climbing fires, who snatches up her babe"
1716,CANTO XXIII,"And flies ne'er pausing, careful more of him"
1717,CANTO XXIII,"Than of herself, that but a single vest"
1718,CANTO XXIII,Clings round her limbs.  Down from the jutting beach
1719,CANTO XXIII,"Supine he cast him, to that pendent rock,"
1720,CANTO XXIII,Which closes on one part the other chasm.
1721,CANTO XXIII,
1722,CANTO XXIII,Never ran water with such hurrying pace
1723,CANTO XXIII,"Adown the tube to turn a landmill's wheel,"
1724,CANTO XXIII,"When nearest it approaches to the spokes,"
1725,CANTO XXIII,"As then along that edge my master ran,"
1726,CANTO XXIII,"Carrying me in his bosom, as a child,"
1727,CANTO XXIII,Not a companion.  Scarcely had his feet
1728,CANTO XXIII,"Reach'd to the lowest of the bed beneath,"
1729,CANTO XXIII,
1730,CANTO XXIII,When over us the steep they reach'd; but fear
1731,CANTO XXIII,"In him was none; for that high Providence,"
1732,CANTO XXIII,"Which plac'd them ministers of the fifth foss,"
1733,CANTO XXIII,Power of departing thence took from them all.
1734,CANTO XXIII,
1735,CANTO XXIII,"There in the depth we saw a painted tribe,"
1736,CANTO XXIII,"Who pac'd with tardy steps around, and wept,"
1737,CANTO XXIII,Faint in appearance and o'ercome with toil.
1738,CANTO XXIII,"Caps had they on, with hoods, that fell low down"
1739,CANTO XXIII,"Before their eyes, in fashion like to those"
1740,CANTO XXIII,Worn by the monks in Cologne.  Their outside
1741,CANTO XXIII,"Was overlaid with gold, dazzling to view,"
1742,CANTO XXIII,"But leaden all within, and of such weight,"
1743,CANTO XXIII,That Frederick's compar'd to these were straw.
1744,CANTO XXIII,"Oh, everlasting wearisome attire!"
1745,CANTO XXIII,
1746,CANTO XXIII,We yet once more with them together turn'd
1747,CANTO XXIII,"To leftward, on their dismal moan intent."
1748,CANTO XXIII,"But by the weight oppress'd, so slowly came"
1749,CANTO XXIII,"The fainting people, that our company"
1750,CANTO XXIII,Was chang'd at every movement of the step.
1751,CANTO XXIII,
1752,CANTO XXIII,"Whence I my guide address'd: ""See that thou find"
1753,CANTO XXIII,"Some spirit, whose name may by his deeds be known,"
1754,CANTO XXIII,"And to that end look round thee as thou go'st."""
1755,CANTO XXIII,
1756,CANTO XXIII,"Then one, who understood the Tuscan voice,"
1757,CANTO XXIII,"Cried after us aloud: ""Hold in your feet,"
1758,CANTO XXIII,Ye who so swiftly speed through the dusk air.
1759,CANTO XXIII,"Perchance from me thou shalt obtain thy wish."""
1760,CANTO XXIII,
1761,CANTO XXIII,"Whereat my leader, turning, me bespake:"
1762,CANTO XXIII,"""Pause, and then onward at their pace proceed."""
1763,CANTO XXIII,
1764,CANTO XXIII,"I staid, and saw two Spirits in whose look"
1765,CANTO XXIII,Impatient eagerness of mind was mark'd
1766,CANTO XXIII,To overtake me; but the load they bare
1767,CANTO XXIII,And narrow path retarded their approach.
1768,CANTO XXIII,
1769,CANTO XXIII,"Soon as arriv'd, they with an eye askance"
1770,CANTO XXIII,"Perus'd me, but spake not: then turning each"
1771,CANTO XXIII,"To other thus conferring said: ""This one"
1772,CANTO XXIII,"Seems, by the action of his throat, alive."
1773,CANTO XXIII,"And, be they dead, what privilege allows"
1774,CANTO XXIII,"They walk unmantled by the cumbrous stole?"""
1775,CANTO XXIII,
1776,CANTO XXIII,"Then thus to me: ""Tuscan, who visitest"
1777,CANTO XXIII,"The college of the mourning hypocrites,"
1778,CANTO XXIII,"Disdain not to instruct us who thou art."""
1779,CANTO XXIII,
1780,CANTO XXIII,"""By Arno's pleasant stream,"" I thus replied,"
1781,CANTO XXIII,"""In the great city I was bred and grew,"
1782,CANTO XXIII,And wear the body I have ever worn.
1783,CANTO XXIII,"but who are ye, from whom such mighty grief,"
1784,CANTO XXIII,"As now I witness, courseth down your cheeks?"
1785,CANTO XXIII,"What torment breaks forth in this bitter woe?"""
1786,CANTO XXIII,"""Our bonnets gleaming bright with orange hue,"""
1787,CANTO XXIII,"One of them answer'd, ""are so leaden gross,"
1788,CANTO XXIII,That with their weight they make the balances
1789,CANTO XXIII,"To crack beneath them.  Joyous friars we were,"
1790,CANTO XXIII,"Bologna's natives, Catalano I,"
1791,CANTO XXIII,"He Loderingo nam'd, and by thy land"
1792,CANTO XXIII,"Together taken, as men used to take"
1793,CANTO XXIII,"A single and indifferent arbiter,"
1794,CANTO XXIII,"To reconcile their strifes.  How there we sped,"
1795,CANTO XXIII,"Gardingo's vicinage can best declare."""
1796,CANTO XXIII,
1797,CANTO XXIII,"""O friars!""  I began, ""your miseries--"""
1798,CANTO XXIII,"But there brake off, for one had caught my eye,"
1799,CANTO XXIII,Fix'd to a cross with three stakes on the ground:
1800,CANTO XXIII,"He, when he saw me, writh'd himself, throughout"
1801,CANTO XXIII,"Distorted, ruffling with deep sighs his beard."
1802,CANTO XXIII,"And Catalano, who thereof was 'ware,"
1803,CANTO XXIII,
1804,CANTO XXIII,"Thus spake: ""That pierced spirit, whom intent"
1805,CANTO XXIII,"Thou view'st, was he who gave the Pharisees"
1806,CANTO XXIII,"Counsel, that it were fitting for one man"
1807,CANTO XXIII,To suffer for the people.  He doth lie
1808,CANTO XXIII,"Transverse; nor any passes, but him first"
1809,CANTO XXIII,Behoves make feeling trial how each weighs.
1810,CANTO XXIII,In straits like this along the foss are plac'd
1811,CANTO XXIII,"The father of his consort, and the rest"
1812,CANTO XXIII,"Partakers in that council, seed of ill"
1813,CANTO XXIII,"And sorrow to the Jews.""  I noted then,"
1814,CANTO XXIII,"How Virgil gaz'd with wonder upon him,"
1815,CANTO XXIII,Thus abjectly extended on the cross
1816,CANTO XXIII,In banishment eternal.  To the friar
1817,CANTO XXIII,"He next his words address'd: ""We pray ye tell,"
1818,CANTO XXIII,"If so be lawful, whether on our right"
1819,CANTO XXIII,"Lies any opening in the rock, whereby"
1820,CANTO XXIII,"We both may issue hence, without constraint"
1821,CANTO XXIII,"On the dark angels, that compell'd they come"
1822,CANTO XXIII,"To lead us from this depth.""  He thus replied:"
1823,CANTO XXIII,"""Nearer than thou dost hope, there is a rock"
1824,CANTO XXIII,"From the next circle moving, which o'ersteps"
1825,CANTO XXIII,"Each vale of horror, save that here his cope"
1826,CANTO XXIII,Is shatter'd.  By the ruin ye may mount:
1827,CANTO XXIII,"For on the side it slants, and most the height"
1828,CANTO XXIII,"Rises below.""  With head bent down awhile"
1829,CANTO XXIII,"My leader stood, then spake: ""He warn'd us ill,"
1830,CANTO XXIII,"Who yonder hangs the sinners on his hook."""
1831,CANTO XXIII,
1832,CANTO XXIII,To whom the friar: At Bologna erst
1833,CANTO XXIII,"""I many vices of the devil heard,"
1834,CANTO XXIII,"Among the rest was said, 'He is a liar,"
1835,CANTO XXIII,"And the father of lies!'""  When he had spoke,"
1836,CANTO XXIII,"My leader with large strides proceeded on,"
1837,CANTO XXIII,Somewhat disturb'd with anger in his look.
1838,CANTO XXIII,
1839,CANTO XXIII,"I therefore left the spirits heavy laden,"
1840,CANTO XXIII,"And following, his beloved footsteps mark'd."

1850,CANTO XXIV,When as the rime upon the earth puts on
1851,CANTO XXIV,"Her dazzling sister's image, but not long"
1852,CANTO XXIV,"Her milder sway endures, then riseth up"
1853,CANTO XXIV,"The village hind, whom fails his wintry store,"
1854,CANTO XXIV,And looking out beholds the plain around
1855,CANTO XXIV,"All whiten'd, whence impatiently he smites"
1856,CANTO XXIV,"His thighs, and to his hut returning in,"
1857,CANTO XXIV,"There paces to and fro, wailing his lot,"
1858,CANTO XXIV,As a discomfited and helpless man;
1859,CANTO XXIV,"Then comes he forth again, and feels new hope"
1860,CANTO XXIV,"Spring in his bosom, finding e'en thus soon"
1861,CANTO XXIV,"The world hath chang'd its count'nance, grasps his crook,"

1863,CANTO XXIV,So me my guide dishearten'd when I saw
1864,CANTO XXIV,"His troubled forehead, and so speedily"
1865,CANTO XXIV,That ill was cur'd; for at the fallen bridge
1866,CANTO XXIV,"Arriving, towards me with a look as sweet,"
1867,CANTO XXIV,"He turn'd him back, as that I first beheld"
1868,CANTO XXIV,At the steep mountain's foot.  Regarding well
1869,CANTO XXIV,"The ruin, and some counsel first maintain'd"
1870,CANTO XXIV,"With his own thought, he open'd wide his arm"
1871,CANTO XXIV,"And took me up.  As one, who, while he works,"
1872,CANTO XXIV,"Computes his labour's issue, that he seems"
1873,CANTO XXIV,"Still to foresee the' effect, so lifting me"
1874,CANTO XXIV,"Up to the summit of one peak, he fix'd"
1875,CANTO XXIV,"His eye upon another.  ""Grapple that,"""
1876,CANTO XXIV,"Said he, ""but first make proof, if it be such"
1877,CANTO XXIV,"As will sustain thee.""  For one capp'd with lead"
1878,CANTO XXIV,"This were no journey.  Scarcely he, though light,"
1879,CANTO XXIV,"And I, though onward push'd from crag to crag,"
1880,CANTO XXIV,Could mount.  And if the precinct of this coast
1881,CANTO XXIV,"Were not less ample than the last, for him"
1882,CANTO XXIV,"I know not, but my strength had surely fail'd."
1883,CANTO XXIV,But Malebolge all toward the mouth
1884,CANTO XXIV,"Inclining of the nethermost abyss,"
1885,CANTO XXIV,"The site of every valley hence requires,"
1886,CANTO XXIV,"That one side upward slope, the other fall."
1887,CANTO XXIV,
1888,CANTO XXIV,At length the point of our descent we reach'd
1889,CANTO XXIV,"From the last flag: soon as to that arriv'd,"
1890,CANTO XXIV,"So was the breath exhausted from my lungs,"
1891,CANTO XXIV,"I could no further, but did seat me there."
1892,CANTO XXIV,
1893,CANTO XXIV,"""Now needs thy best of man;"" so spake my guide:"
1894,CANTO XXIV,"""For not on downy plumes, nor under shade"

1898,CANTO XXIV,As smoke in air or foam upon the wave.
1899,CANTO XXIV,Thou therefore rise: vanish thy weariness
1900,CANTO XXIV,"By the mind's effort, in each struggle form'd"
1901,CANTO XXIV,"To vanquish, if she suffer not the weight"
1902,CANTO XXIV,Of her corporeal frame to crush her down.
1903,CANTO XXIV,A longer ladder yet remains to scale.

1906,CANTO XXIV,
1907,CANTO XXIV,"I straightway rose, and show'd myself less spent"

1910,CANTO XXIV,"Our way we held, more rugged than before,"
1911,CANTO XXIV,Narrower and steeper far to climb.  From talk

1913,CANTO XXIV,Least faint; whereat a voice from the other foss
1914,CANTO XXIV,"Did issue forth, for utt'rance suited ill."

1916,CANTO XXIV,"What were the words I knew not, but who spake"
1917,CANTO XXIV,"Seem'd mov'd in anger.  Down I stoop'd to look,"
1918,CANTO XXIV,But my quick eye might reach not to the depth
1919,CANTO XXIV,For shrouding darkness; wherefore thus I spake:
1920,CANTO XXIV,"""To the next circle, Teacher, bend thy steps,"

1926,CANTO XXIV,
1927,CANTO XXIV,"We from the bridge's head descended, where"
1928,CANTO XXIV,"To the eighth mound it joins, and then the chasm"
1929,CANTO XXIV,"Opening to view, I saw a crowd within"
1930,CANTO XXIV,"Of serpents terrible, so strange of shape"
1931,CANTO XXIV,"And hideous, that remembrance in my veins"
1932,CANTO XXIV,Yet shrinks the vital current.  Of her sands
1933,CANTO XXIV,"Let Lybia vaunt no more: if Jaculus,"
1934,CANTO XXIV,"Pareas and Chelyder be her brood,"
1935,CANTO XXIV,"Cenchris and Amphisboena, plagues so dire"

1937,CANTO XXIV,"Not with all Ethiopia, and whate'er"
1938,CANTO XXIV,Above the Erythraean sea is spawn'd.
1939,CANTO XXIV,
1940,CANTO XXIV,Amid this dread exuberance of woe
1941,CANTO XXIV,"Ran naked spirits wing'd with horrid fear,"
1942,CANTO XXIV,"Nor hope had they of crevice where to hide,"
1943,CANTO XXIV,Or heliotrope to charm them out of view.
1944,CANTO XXIV,"With serpents were their hands behind them bound,"
1945,CANTO XXIV,Which through their reins infix'd the tail and head
1946,CANTO XXIV,Twisted in folds before.  And lo! on one
1947,CANTO XXIV,"Near to our side, darted an adder up,"
1948,CANTO XXIV,"And, where the neck is on the shoulders tied,"
1949,CANTO XXIV,Transpierc'd him.  Far more quickly than e'er pen
1950,CANTO XXIV,"Wrote O or I, he kindled, burn'd, and chang'd"
1951,CANTO XXIV,"To ashes, all pour'd out upon the earth."
1952,CANTO XXIV,"When there dissolv'd he lay, the dust again"
1953,CANTO XXIV,"Uproll'd spontaneous, and the self-same form"
1954,CANTO XXIV,"Instant resumed.  So mighty sages tell,"
1955,CANTO XXIV,"The' Arabian Phoenix, when five hundred years"
1956,CANTO XXIV,"Have well nigh circled, dies, and springs forthwith"
1957,CANTO XXIV,Renascent.  Blade nor herb throughout his life
1958,CANTO XXIV,"He tastes, but tears of frankincense alone"
1959,CANTO XXIV,And odorous amomum: swaths of nard
1960,CANTO XXIV,"And myrrh his funeral shroud.  As one that falls,"
1961,CANTO XXIV,"He knows not how, by force demoniac dragg'd"
1962,CANTO XXIV,"To earth, or through obstruction fettering up"
1963,CANTO XXIV,"In chains invisible the powers of man,"
1964,CANTO XXIV,"Who, risen from his trance, gazeth around,"
1965,CANTO XXIV,Bewilder'd with the monstrous agony
1966,CANTO XXIV,"He hath endur'd, and wildly staring sighs;"
1967,CANTO XXIV,So stood aghast the sinner when he rose.
1968,CANTO XXIV,
1969,CANTO XXIV,"Oh! how severe God's judgment, that deals out"
1970,CANTO XXIV,Such blows in stormy vengeance!  Who he was
1971,CANTO XXIV,"My teacher next inquir'd, and thus in few"
1972,CANTO XXIV,"He answer'd: ""Vanni Fucci am I call'd,"
1973,CANTO XXIV,Not long since rained down from Tuscany
1974,CANTO XXIV,To this dire gullet.  Me the beastial life
1975,CANTO XXIV,"And not the human pleas'd, mule that I was,"
1976,CANTO XXIV,"Who in Pistoia found my worthy den."""
1977,CANTO XXIV,
1978,CANTO XXIV,"I then to Virgil: ""Bid him stir not hence,"
1979,CANTO XXIV,And ask what crime did thrust him hither: once
1980,CANTO XXIV,"A man I knew him choleric and bloody."""
1981,CANTO XXIV,
1982,CANTO XXIV,"The sinner heard and feign'd not, but towards me"
1983,CANTO XXIV,"His mind directing and his face, wherein"
1984,CANTO XXIV,"Was dismal shame depictur'd, thus he spake:"
1985,CANTO XXIV,"""It grieves me more to have been caught by thee"
1986,CANTO XXIV,"In this sad plight, which thou beholdest, than"
1987,CANTO XXIV,When I was taken from the other life.
1988,CANTO XXIV,I have no power permitted to deny
1989,CANTO XXIV,What thou inquirest.  I am doom'd thus low
1990,CANTO XXIV,"To dwell, for that the sacristy by me"
1991,CANTO XXIV,"Was rifled of its goodly ornaments,"
1992,CANTO XXIV,And with the guilt another falsely charged.
1993,CANTO XXIV,"But that thou mayst not joy to see me thus,"
1994,CANTO XXIV,So as thou e'er shalt 'scape this darksome realm
1995,CANTO XXIV,Open thine ears and hear what I forebode.
1996,CANTO XXIV,"Reft of the Neri first Pistoia pines,"
1997,CANTO XXIV,Then Florence changeth citizens and laws.
1998,CANTO XXIV,"From Valdimagra, drawn by wrathful Mars,"
1999,CANTO XXIV,"A vapour rises, wrapt in turbid mists,"
2000,CANTO XXIV,And sharp and eager driveth on the storm
2001,CANTO XXIV,"With arrowy hurtling o'er Piceno's field,"
2002,CANTO XXIV,"Whence suddenly the cloud shall burst, and strike"
2003,CANTO XXIV,Each helpless Bianco prostrate to the ground.
2004,CANTO XXIV,"This have I told, that grief may rend thy heart."""
2005,CANTO XXIV,
2006,CANTO XXIV,
2007,CANTO XXIV,
2008,CANTO XXIV,
2009,CANTO XXV,CANTO XXV
2010,CANTO XXV,
2011,CANTO XXV,"WHEN he had spoke, the sinner rais'd his hands"
2012,CANTO XXV,"Pointed in mockery, and cried: ""Take them, God!"
2013,CANTO XXV,"I level them at thee!""  From that day forth"
2014,CANTO XXV,The serpents were my friends; for round his neck
2015,CANTO XXV,"One of then rolling twisted, as it said,"
2016,CANTO XXV,"""Be silent, tongue!""  Another to his arms"
2017,CANTO XXV,"Upgliding, tied them, riveting itself"
2018,CANTO XXV,"So close, it took from them the power to move."
2019,CANTO XXV,
2020,CANTO XXV,Pistoia!  Ah Pistoia! why dost doubt
2021,CANTO XXV,"To turn thee into ashes, cumb'ring earth"
2022,CANTO XXV,"No longer, since in evil act so far"
2023,CANTO XXV,"Thou hast outdone thy seed?  I did not mark,"
2024,CANTO XXV,"Through all the gloomy circles of the' abyss,"
2025,CANTO XXV,"Spirit, that swell'd so proudly 'gainst his God,"
2026,CANTO XXV,"Not him, who headlong fell from Thebes.  He fled,"
2027,CANTO XXV,Nor utter'd more; and after him there came
2028,CANTO XXV,"A centaur full of fury, shouting, ""Where"
2029,CANTO XXV,"Where is the caitiff?""  On Maremma's marsh"
2030,CANTO XXV,"Swarm not the serpent tribe, as on his haunch"
2031,CANTO XXV,"They swarm'd, to where the human face begins."
2032,CANTO XXV,"Behind his head upon the shoulders lay,"
2033,CANTO XXV,"With open wings, a dragon breathing fire"
2034,CANTO XXV,On whomsoe'er he met.  To me my guide:
2035,CANTO XXV,"""Cacus is this, who underneath the rock"
2036,CANTO XXV,Of Aventine spread oft a lake of blood.
2037,CANTO XXV,"He, from his brethren parted, here must tread"
2038,CANTO XXV,"A different journey, for his fraudful theft"
2039,CANTO XXV,"Of the great herd, that near him stall'd; whence found"
2040,CANTO XXV,"His felon deeds their end, beneath the mace"
2041,CANTO XXV,"Of stout Alcides, that perchance laid on"
2042,CANTO XXV,"A hundred blows, and not the tenth was felt."""
2043,CANTO XXV,
2044,CANTO XXV,"While yet he spake, the centaur sped away:"
2045,CANTO XXV,"And under us three spirits came, of whom"
2046,CANTO XXV,"Nor I nor he was ware, till they exclaim'd;"
2047,CANTO XXV,"""Say who are ye?""  We then brake off discourse,"
2048,CANTO XXV,Intent on these alone.  I knew them not;
2049,CANTO XXV,"But, as it chanceth oft, befell, that one"
2050,CANTO XXV,"Had need to name another.  ""Where,"" said he,"
2051,CANTO XXV,"""Doth Cianfa lurk?""  I, for a sign my guide"
2052,CANTO XXV,"Should stand attentive, plac'd against my lips"
2053,CANTO XXV,"The finger lifted.  If, O reader! now"
2054,CANTO XXV,"Thou be not apt to credit what I tell,"
2055,CANTO XXV,No marvel; for myself do scarce allow
2056,CANTO XXV,The witness of mine eyes.  But as I looked
2057,CANTO XXV,"Toward them, lo! a serpent with six feet"
2058,CANTO XXV,"Springs forth on one, and fastens full upon him:"
2059,CANTO XXV,"His midmost grasp'd the belly, a forefoot"
2060,CANTO XXV,Seiz'd on each arm (while deep in either cheek
2061,CANTO XXV,He flesh'd his fangs); the hinder on the thighs
2062,CANTO XXV,"Were spread, 'twixt which the tail inserted curl'd"
2063,CANTO XXV,Upon the reins behind.  Ivy ne'er clasp'd
2064,CANTO XXV,"A dodder'd oak, as round the other's limbs"
2065,CANTO XXV,The hideous monster intertwin'd his own.
2066,CANTO XXV,"Then, as they both had been of burning wax,"
2067,CANTO XXV,"Each melted into other, mingling hues,"
2068,CANTO XXV,That which was either now was seen no more.
2069,CANTO XXV,"Thus up the shrinking paper, ere it burns,"
2070,CANTO XXV,"A brown tint glides, not turning yet to black,"
2071,CANTO XXV,And the clean white expires.  The other two
2072,CANTO XXV,"Look'd on exclaiming: ""Ah, how dost thou change,"
2073,CANTO XXV,"Agnello!  See!  Thou art nor double now,"
2074,CANTO XXV,
2075,CANTO XXV,"""Nor only one.""  The two heads now became"
2076,CANTO XXV,"One, and two figures blended in one form"
2077,CANTO XXV,"Appear'd, where both were lost.  Of the four lengths"
2078,CANTO XXV,Two arms were made: the belly and the chest
2079,CANTO XXV,"The thighs and legs into such members chang'd,"
2080,CANTO XXV,As never eye hath seen.  Of former shape
2081,CANTO XXV,All trace was vanish'd.  Two yet neither seem'd
2082,CANTO XXV,"That image miscreate, and so pass'd on"
2083,CANTO XXV,With tardy steps.  As underneath the scourge
2084,CANTO XXV,"Of the fierce dog-star, that lays bare the fields,"
2085,CANTO XXV,"Shifting from brake to brake, the lizard seems"
2086,CANTO XXV,"A flash of lightning, if he thwart the road,"
2087,CANTO XXV,So toward th' entrails of the other two
2088,CANTO XXV,"Approaching seem'd, an adder all on fire,"
2089,CANTO XXV,"As the dark pepper-grain, livid and swart."
2090,CANTO XXV,"In that part, whence our life is nourish'd first,"
2091,CANTO XXV,One he transpierc'd; then down before him fell
2092,CANTO XXV,Stretch'd out.  The pierced spirit look'd on him
2093,CANTO XXV,"But spake not; yea stood motionless and yawn'd,"
2094,CANTO XXV,As if by sleep or fev'rous fit assail'd.
2095,CANTO XXV,"He ey'd the serpent, and the serpent him."
2096,CANTO XXV,"One from the wound, the other from the mouth"
2097,CANTO XXV,"Breath'd a thick smoke, whose vap'ry columns join'd."
2098,CANTO XXV,
2099,CANTO XXV,"Lucan in mute attention now may hear,"
2100,CANTO XXV,"Nor thy disastrous fate, Sabellus! tell,"
2101,CANTO XXV,"Nor shine, Nasidius!  Ovid now be mute."
2102,CANTO XXV,What if in warbling fiction he record
2103,CANTO XXV,"Cadmus and Arethusa, to a snake"
2104,CANTO XXV,"Him chang'd, and her into a fountain clear,"
2105,CANTO XXV,I envy not; for never face to face
2106,CANTO XXV,"Two natures thus transmuted did he sing,"
2107,CANTO XXV,Wherein both shapes were ready to assume
2108,CANTO XXV,The other's substance.  They in mutual guise
2109,CANTO XXV,"So answer'd, that the serpent split his train"
2110,CANTO XXV,"Divided to a fork, and the pierc'd spirit"
2111,CANTO XXV,"Drew close his steps together, legs and thighs"
2112,CANTO XXV,"Compacted, that no sign of juncture soon"
2113,CANTO XXV,Was visible: the tail disparted took
2114,CANTO XXV,"The figure which the spirit lost, its skin"
2115,CANTO XXV,"Soft'ning, his indurated to a rind."
2116,CANTO XXV,"The shoulders next I mark'd, that ent'ring join'd"
2117,CANTO XXV,"The monster's arm-pits, whose two shorter feet"
2118,CANTO XXV,"So lengthen'd, as the other's dwindling shrunk."
2119,CANTO XXV,The feet behind then twisting up became
2120,CANTO XXV,"That part that man conceals, which in the wretch"
2121,CANTO XXV,Was cleft in twain.  While both the shadowy smoke
2122,CANTO XXV,"With a new colour veils, and generates"
2123,CANTO XXV,"Th' excrescent pile on one, peeling it off"
2124,CANTO XXV,"From th' other body, lo! upon his feet"
2125,CANTO XXV,"One upright rose, and prone the other fell."
2126,CANTO XXV,Not yet their glaring and malignant lamps
2127,CANTO XXV,"Were shifted, though each feature chang'd beneath."
2128,CANTO XXV,"Of him who stood erect, the mounting face"
2129,CANTO XXV,"Retreated towards the temples, and what there"
2130,CANTO XXV,"Superfluous matter came, shot out in ears"
2131,CANTO XXV,"From the smooth cheeks, the rest, not backward dragg'd,"
2132,CANTO XXV,Of its excess did shape the nose; and swell'd
2133,CANTO XXV,Into due size protuberant the lips.
2134,CANTO XXV,"He, on the earth who lay, meanwhile extends"
2135,CANTO XXV,"His sharpen'd visage, and draws down the ears"
2136,CANTO XXV,"Into the head, as doth the slug his horns."
2137,CANTO XXV,His tongue continuous before and apt
2138,CANTO XXV,"For utt'rance, severs; and the other's fork"
2139,CANTO XXV,Closing unites.  That done the smoke was laid.
2140,CANTO XXV,"The soul, transform'd into the brute, glides off,"
2141,CANTO XXV,"Hissing along the vale, and after him"
2142,CANTO XXV,The other talking sputters; but soon turn'd
2143,CANTO XXV,"His new-grown shoulders on him, and in few"
2144,CANTO XXV,"Thus to another spake: ""Along this path"
2145,CANTO XXV,"Crawling, as I have done, speed Buoso now!"""
2146,CANTO XXV,
2147,CANTO XXV,So saw I fluctuate in successive change
2148,CANTO XXV,Th' unsteady ballast of the seventh hold:
2149,CANTO XXV,"And here if aught my tongue have swerv'd, events"
2150,CANTO XXV,So strange may be its warrant.  O'er mine eyes
2151,CANTO XXV,"Confusion hung, and on my thoughts amaze."
2152,CANTO XXV,
2153,CANTO XXV,"Yet 'scap'd they not so covertly, but well"
2154,CANTO XXV,I mark'd Sciancato: he alone it was
2155,CANTO XXV,"Of the three first that came, who chang'd not: thou,"
2156,CANTO XXV,"The other's fate, Gaville, still dost rue."
2157,CANTO XXV,
2158,CANTO XXV,
2159,CANTO XXV,
2160,CANTO XXV,
2161,CANTO XXVI,CANTO XXVI
2162,CANTO XXVI,
2163,CANTO XXVI,FLORENCE exult! for thou so mightily
2164,CANTO XXVI,"Hast thriven, that o'er land and sea thy wings"
2165,CANTO XXVI,"Thou beatest, and thy name spreads over hell!"
2166,CANTO XXVI,Among the plund'rers such the three I found
2167,CANTO XXVI,"Thy citizens, whence shame to me thy son,"
2168,CANTO XXVI,And no proud honour to thyself redounds.
2169,CANTO XXVI,
2170,CANTO XXVI,"But if our minds, when dreaming near the dawn,"
2171,CANTO XXVI,"Are of the truth presageful, thou ere long"
2172,CANTO XXVI,"Shalt feel what Prato, (not to say the rest)"
2173,CANTO XXVI,Would fain might come upon thee; and that chance
2174,CANTO XXVI,"Were in good time, if it befell thee now."
2175,CANTO XXVI,"Would so it were, since it must needs befall!"
2176,CANTO XXVI,"For as time wears me, I shall grieve the more."
2177,CANTO XXVI,
2178,CANTO XXVI,We from the depth departed; and my guide
2179,CANTO XXVI,"Remounting scal'd the flinty steps, which late"
2180,CANTO XXVI,"We downward trac'd, and drew me up the steep."
2181,CANTO XXVI,Pursuing thus our solitary way
2182,CANTO XXVI,"Among the crags and splinters of the rock,"
2183,CANTO XXVI,Sped not our feet without the help of hands.
2184,CANTO XXVI,
2185,CANTO XXVI,"Then sorrow seiz'd me, which e'en now revives,"
2186,CANTO XXVI,"As my thought turns again to what I saw,"
2187,CANTO XXVI,"And, more than I am wont, I rein and curb"
2188,CANTO XXVI,"The powers of nature in me, lest they run"
2189,CANTO XXVI,Where Virtue guides not; that if aught of good
2190,CANTO XXVI,"My gentle star, or something better gave me,"
2191,CANTO XXVI,I envy not myself the precious boon.
2192,CANTO XXVI,
2193,CANTO XXVI,"As in that season, when the sun least veils"
2194,CANTO XXVI,"His face that lightens all, what time the fly"
2195,CANTO XXVI,"Gives way to the shrill gnat, the peasant then"
2196,CANTO XXVI,"Upon some cliff reclin'd, beneath him sees"
2197,CANTO XXVI,"Fire-flies innumerous spangling o'er the vale,"
2198,CANTO XXVI,"Vineyard or tilth, where his day-labour lies:"
2199,CANTO XXVI,With flames so numberless throughout its space
2200,CANTO XXVI,"Shone the eighth chasm, apparent, when the depth"
2201,CANTO XXVI,"Was to my view expos'd. As he, whose wrongs"
2202,CANTO XXVI,"The bears aveng'd, at its departure saw"
2203,CANTO XXVI,"Elijah's chariot, when the steeds erect"
2204,CANTO XXVI,"Rais'd their steep flight for heav'n; his eyes meanwhile,"
2205,CANTO XXVI,"Straining pursu'd them, till the flame alone"
2206,CANTO XXVI,Upsoaring like a misty speck he kenn'd;
2207,CANTO XXVI,"E'en thus along the gulf moves every flame,"
2208,CANTO XXVI,"A sinner so enfolded close in each,"
2209,CANTO XXVI,That none exhibits token of the theft.
2210,CANTO XXVI,
2211,CANTO XXVI,"Upon the bridge I forward bent to look,"
2212,CANTO XXVI,"And grasp'd a flinty mass, or else had fall'n,"
2213,CANTO XXVI,"Though push'd not from the height.  The guide, who mark'd"
2214,CANTO XXVI,"How I did gaze attentive, thus began:"
2215,CANTO XXVI,
2216,CANTO XXVI,"""Within these ardours are the spirits, each"
2217,CANTO XXVI,"Swath'd in confining fire.""--""Master, thy word,"""
2218,CANTO XXVI,"I answer'd, ""hath assur'd me; yet I deem'd"
2219,CANTO XXVI,"Already of the truth, already wish'd"
2220,CANTO XXVI,"To ask thee, who is in yon fire, that comes"
2221,CANTO XXVI,"So parted at the summit, as it seem'd"
2222,CANTO XXVI,"Ascending from that funeral pile, where lay"
2223,CANTO XXVI,"The Theban brothers?""  He replied: ""Within"
2224,CANTO XXVI,Ulysses there and Diomede endure
2225,CANTO XXVI,"Their penal tortures, thus to vengeance now"
2226,CANTO XXVI,"Together hasting, as erewhile to wrath."
2227,CANTO XXVI,These in the flame with ceaseless groans deplore
2228,CANTO XXVI,"The ambush of the horse, that open'd wide"
2229,CANTO XXVI,"A portal for that goodly seed to pass,"
2230,CANTO XXVI,Which sow'd imperial Rome; nor less the guile
2231,CANTO XXVI,"Lament they, whence of her Achilles 'reft"
2232,CANTO XXVI,Deidamia yet in death complains.
2233,CANTO XXVI,"And there is rued the stratagem, that Troy"
2234,CANTO XXVI,"Of her Palladium spoil'd.""--""If they have power"
2235,CANTO XXVI,"Of utt'rance from within these sparks,"" said I,"
2236,CANTO XXVI,"""O master! think my prayer a thousand fold"
2237,CANTO XXVI,"In repetition urg'd, that thou vouchsafe"
2238,CANTO XXVI,"To pause, till here the horned flame arrive."
2239,CANTO XXVI,"See, how toward it with desire I bend."""
2240,CANTO XXVI,
2241,CANTO XXVI,"He thus: ""Thy prayer is worthy of much praise,"
2242,CANTO XXVI,And I accept it therefore: but do thou
2243,CANTO XXVI,"Thy tongue refrain: to question them be mine,"
2244,CANTO XXVI,"For I divine thy wish: and they perchance,"
2245,CANTO XXVI,"For they were Greeks, might shun discourse with thee."""
2246,CANTO XXVI,
2247,CANTO XXVI,"When there the flame had come, where time and place"
2248,CANTO XXVI,"Seem'd fitting to my guide, he thus began:"
2249,CANTO XXVI,"""O ye, who dwell two spirits in one fire!"
2250,CANTO XXVI,"If living I of you did merit aught,"
2251,CANTO XXVI,"Whate'er the measure were of that desert,"
2252,CANTO XXVI,"When in the world my lofty strain I pour'd,"
2253,CANTO XXVI,"Move ye not on, till one of you unfold"
2254,CANTO XXVI,"In what clime death o'ertook him self-destroy'd."""
2255,CANTO XXVI,
2256,CANTO XXVI,Of the old flame forthwith the greater horn
2257,CANTO XXVI,"Began to roll, murmuring, as a fire"
2258,CANTO XXVI,"That labours with the wind, then to and fro"
2259,CANTO XXVI,"Wagging the top, as a tongue uttering sounds,"
2260,CANTO XXVI,"Threw out its voice, and spake: ""When I escap'd"
2261,CANTO XXVI,"From Circe, who beyond a circling year"
2262,CANTO XXVI,"Had held me near Caieta, by her charms,"
2263,CANTO XXVI,"Ere thus Aeneas yet had nam'd the shore,"
2264,CANTO XXVI,"Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence"
2265,CANTO XXVI,"Of my old father, nor return of love,"
2266,CANTO XXVI,"That should have crown'd Penelope with joy,"
2267,CANTO XXVI,Could overcome in me the zeal I had
2268,CANTO XXVI,"T' explore the world, and search the ways of life,"
2269,CANTO XXVI,Man's evil and his virtue.  Forth I sail'd
2270,CANTO XXVI,"Into the deep illimitable main,"
2271,CANTO XXVI,"With but one bark, and the small faithful band"
2272,CANTO XXVI,"That yet cleav'd to me.  As Iberia far,"
2273,CANTO XXVI,"Far as Morocco either shore I saw,"
2274,CANTO XXVI,And the Sardinian and each isle beside
2275,CANTO XXVI,Which round that ocean bathes.  Tardy with age
2276,CANTO XXVI,"Were I and my companions, when we came"
2277,CANTO XXVI,"To the strait pass, where Hercules ordain'd"
2278,CANTO XXVI,The bound'ries not to be o'erstepp'd by man.
2279,CANTO XXVI,"The walls of Seville to my right I left,"
2280,CANTO XXVI,On the' other hand already Ceuta past.
2281,CANTO XXVI,
2282,CANTO XXVI,"""O brothers!""  I began, ""who to the west"
2283,CANTO XXVI,"Through perils without number now have reach'd,"
2284,CANTO XXVI,"To this the short remaining watch, that yet"
2285,CANTO XXVI,"Our senses have to wake, refuse not proof"
2286,CANTO XXVI,"Of the unpeopled world, following the track"
2287,CANTO XXVI,Of Phoebus. Call to mind from whence we sprang:
2288,CANTO XXVI,Ye were not form'd to live the life of brutes
2289,CANTO XXVI,But virtue to pursue and knowledge high.
2290,CANTO XXVI,With these few words I sharpen'd for the voyage
2291,CANTO XXVI,"The mind of my associates, that I then"
2292,CANTO XXVI,Could scarcely have withheld them.  To the dawn
2293,CANTO XXVI,"Our poop we turn'd, and for the witless flight"
2294,CANTO XXVI,"Made our oars wings, still gaining on the left."
2295,CANTO XXVI,"Each star of the' other pole night now beheld,"
2296,CANTO XXVI,"And ours so low, that from the ocean-floor"
2297,CANTO XXVI,"It rose not.  Five times re-illum'd, as oft"
2298,CANTO XXVI,Vanish'd the light from underneath the moon
2299,CANTO XXVI,"Since the deep way we enter'd, when from far"
2300,CANTO XXVI,"Appear'd a mountain dim, loftiest methought"
2301,CANTO XXVI,"Of all I e'er beheld.  Joy seiz'd us straight,"
2302,CANTO XXVI,But soon to mourning changed.  From the new land
2303,CANTO XXVI,"A whirlwind sprung, and at her foremost side"

2688,CANTO XXIX,
2689,CANTO XXIX,So we discours'd to where the rock first show'd
2690,CANTO XXIX,"The other valley, had more light been there,"
2691,CANTO XXIX,E'en to the lowest depth.  Soon as we came
2692,CANTO XXIX,O'er the last cloister in the dismal rounds
2693,CANTO XXIX,"Of Malebolge, and the brotherhood"
2694,CANTO XXIX,"Were to our view expos'd, then many a dart"
2695,CANTO XXIX,"Of sore lament assail'd me, headed all"
2696,CANTO XXIX,"With points of thrilling pity, that I clos'd"
2697,CANTO XXIX,Both ears against the volley with mine hands.
2698,CANTO XXIX,
2699,CANTO XXIX,"As were the torment, if each lazar-house"
2700,CANTO XXIX,"Of Valdichiana, in the sultry time"
2701,CANTO XXIX,"'Twixt July and September, with the isle"
2702,CANTO XXIX,"Sardinia and Maremma's pestilent fen,"
2703,CANTO XXIX,Had heap'd their maladies all in one foss
2704,CANTO XXIX,Together; such was here the torment: dire
2705,CANTO XXIX,"The stench, as issuing steams from fester'd limbs."
2706,CANTO XXIX,
2707,CANTO XXIX,We on the utmost shore of the long rock
2708,CANTO XXIX,Descended still to leftward.  Then my sight
2709,CANTO XXIX,"Was livelier to explore the depth, wherein"
2710,CANTO XXIX,"The minister of the most mighty Lord,"
2711,CANTO XXIX,"All-searching Justice, dooms to punishment"
2712,CANTO XXIX,The forgers noted on her dread record.
2713,CANTO XXIX,
2714,CANTO XXIX,More rueful was it not methinks to see
2715,CANTO XXIX,"The nation in Aegina droop, what time"
2716,CANTO XXIX,"Each living thing, e'en to the little worm,"
2717,CANTO XXIX,"All fell, so full of malice was the air"
2718,CANTO XXIX,"(And afterward, as bards of yore have told,"
2719,CANTO XXIX,The ancient people were restor'd anew
2720,CANTO XXIX,From seed of emmets) than was here to see
2721,CANTO XXIX,"The spirits, that languish'd through the murky vale"
2722,CANTO XXIX,"Up-pil'd on many a stack.  Confus'd they lay,"
2723,CANTO XXIX,"One o'er the belly, o'er the shoulders one"
2724,CANTO XXIX,Roll'd of another; sideling crawl'd a third
2725,CANTO XXIX,Along the dismal pathway.  Step by step
2726,CANTO XXIX,"We journey'd on, in silence looking round"
2727,CANTO XXIX,"And list'ning those diseas'd, who strove in vain"
2728,CANTO XXIX,"To lift their forms.  Then two I mark'd, that sat"
2729,CANTO XXIX,"Propp'd 'gainst each other, as two brazen pans"
2730,CANTO XXIX,"Set to retain the heat.  From head to foot,"
2731,CANTO XXIX,A tetter bark'd them round. Nor saw I e'er
2732,CANTO XXIX,"Groom currying so fast, for whom his lord"
2733,CANTO XXIX,"Impatient waited, or himself perchance"
2734,CANTO XXIX,"Tir'd with long watching, as of these each one"
2735,CANTO XXIX,"Plied quickly his keen nails, through furiousness"
2736,CANTO XXIX,Of ne'er abated pruriency.  The crust
2737,CANTO XXIX,"Came drawn from underneath in flakes, like scales"
2738,CANTO XXIX,Scrap'd from the bream or fish of broader mail.

3051,CANTO XXXI,"As his to others, understood by none."""
3052,CANTO XXXI,
3053,CANTO XXXI,"Then to the leftward turning sped we forth,"
3054,CANTO XXXI,And at a sling's throw found another shade
3055,CANTO XXXI,Far fiercer and more huge.  I cannot say
3056,CANTO XXXI,What master hand had girt him; but he held
3057,CANTO XXXI,"Behind the right arm fetter'd, and before"
3058,CANTO XXXI,"The other with a chain, that fasten'd him"
3059,CANTO XXXI,"From the neck down, and five times round his form"
3060,CANTO XXXI,"Apparent met the wreathed links.  ""This proud one"
3061,CANTO XXXI,Would of his strength against almighty Jove
3062,CANTO XXXI,"Make trial,"" said my guide; ""whence he is thus"
3063,CANTO XXXI,Requited: Ephialtes him they call.
3064,CANTO XXXI,
3065,CANTO XXXI,"""Great was his prowess, when the giants brought"
3066,CANTO XXXI,"Fear on the gods: those arms, which then he piled,"
3067,CANTO XXXI,"Now moves he never.""  Forthwith I return'd:"
3068,CANTO XXXI,"""Fain would I, if 't were possible, mine eyes"
3069,CANTO XXXI,Of Briareus immeasurable gain'd
3070,CANTO XXXI,"Experience next.""  He answer'd: ""Thou shalt see"
3071,CANTO XXXI,"Not far from hence Antaeus, who both speaks"
3072,CANTO XXXI,"And is unfetter'd, who shall place us there"
3073,CANTO XXXI,Where guilt is at its depth.  Far onward stands
3074,CANTO XXXI,"Whom thou wouldst fain behold, in chains, and made"
3075,CANTO XXXI,"Like to this spirit, save that in his looks"
3076,CANTO XXXI,"More fell he seems.""  By violent earthquake rock'd"
3077,CANTO XXXI,"Ne'er shook a tow'r, so reeling to its base,"
3078,CANTO XXXI,As Ephialtes.  More than ever then
3079,CANTO XXXI,"I dreaded death, nor than the terror more"
3080,CANTO XXXI,"Had needed, if I had not seen the cords"
3081,CANTO XXXI,"That held him fast.  We, straightway journeying on,"
3082,CANTO XXXI,"Came to Antaeus, who five ells complete"
3083,CANTO XXXI,"Without the head, forth issued from the cave."
3084,CANTO XXXI,
3085,CANTO XXXI,"""O thou, who in the fortunate vale, that made"
3086,CANTO XXXI,"Great Scipio heir of glory, when his sword"
3087,CANTO XXXI,"Drove back the troop of Hannibal in flight,"
3088,CANTO XXXI,Who thence of old didst carry for thy spoil
3089,CANTO XXXI,An hundred lions; and if thou hadst fought
3090,CANTO XXXI,"In the high conflict on thy brethren's side,"
3091,CANTO XXXI,"Seems as men yet believ'd, that through thine arm"
3092,CANTO XXXI,"The sons of earth had conquer'd, now vouchsafe"
3093,CANTO XXXI,"To place us down beneath, where numbing cold"
3094,CANTO XXXI,Locks up Cocytus.  Force not that we crave
3095,CANTO XXXI,Or Tityus' help or Typhon's.  Here is one
3096,CANTO XXXI,Can give what in this realm ye covet.  Stoop
3097,CANTO XXXI,"Therefore, nor scornfully distort thy lip."
3098,CANTO XXXI,He in the upper world can yet bestow
3099,CANTO XXXI,"Renown on thee, for he doth live, and looks"
3100,CANTO XXXI,"For life yet longer, if before the time"
3101,CANTO XXXI,"Grace call him not unto herself.""  Thus spake"
3102,CANTO XXXI,"The teacher.  He in haste forth stretch'd his hands,"
3103,CANTO XXXI,And caught my guide.  Alcides whilom felt
3104,CANTO XXXI,That grapple straighten'd score.  Soon as my guide
3105,CANTO XXXI,"Had felt it, he bespake me thus: ""This way"
3106,CANTO XXXI,"That I may clasp thee;"" then so caught me up,"
3107,CANTO XXXI,That we were both one burden.  As appears
3108,CANTO XXXI,"The tower of Carisenda, from beneath"
3109,CANTO XXXI,"Where it doth lean, if chance a passing cloud"
3110,CANTO XXXI,"So sail across, that opposite it hangs,"
3111,CANTO XXXI,"Such then Antaeus seem'd, as at mine ease"
3112,CANTO XXXI,I mark'd him stooping.  I were fain at times
3113,CANTO XXXI,"T' have pass'd another way.  Yet in th' abyss,"
3114,CANTO XXXI,"That Lucifer with Judas low ingulfs,"
3115,CANTO XXXI,"Lightly he plac'd us; nor there leaning stay'd,"
3116,CANTO XXXI,But rose as in a bark the stately mast.

3174,CANTO XXXII,"But lower far than they, and I did gaze"
3175,CANTO XXXII,"Still on the lofty battlement, a voice"
3176,CANTO XXXII,"Bespoke me thus: ""Look how thou walkest.  Take"
3177,CANTO XXXII,"Good heed, thy soles do tread not on the heads"
3178,CANTO XXXII,"Of thy poor brethren.""  Thereupon I turn'd,"
3179,CANTO XXXII,And saw before and underneath my feet
3180,CANTO XXXII,"A lake, whose frozen surface liker seem'd"
3181,CANTO XXXII,To glass than water.  Not so thick a veil
3182,CANTO XXXII,In winter e'er hath Austrian Danube spread
3183,CANTO XXXII,"O'er his still course, nor Tanais far remote"

3187,CANTO XXXII,Not e'en its rim had creak'd. As peeps the frog

3190,CANTO XXXII,"So, to where modest shame appears, thus low"
3191,CANTO XXXII,"Blue pinch'd and shrin'd in ice the spirits stood,"
3192,CANTO XXXII,Moving their teeth in shrill note like the stork.
3193,CANTO XXXII,"His face each downward held; their mouth the cold,"
3194,CANTO XXXII,Their eyes express'd the dolour of their heart.
3195,CANTO XXXII,
3196,CANTO XXXII,"A space I look'd around, then at my feet"
3197,CANTO XXXII,"Saw two so strictly join'd, that of their head"
3198,CANTO XXXII,"The very hairs were mingled.  ""Tell me ye,"
3199,CANTO XXXII,"Whose bosoms thus together press,"" said I,"
3200,CANTO XXXII,"""Who are ye?""  At that sound their necks they bent,"
3201,CANTO XXXII,"And when their looks were lifted up to me,"
3202,CANTO XXXII,"Straightway their eyes, before all moist within,"
3203,CANTO XXXII,"Distill'd upon their lips, and the frost bound"
3204,CANTO XXXII,The tears betwixt those orbs and held them there.
3205,CANTO XXXII,Plank unto plank hath never cramp clos'd up
3206,CANTO XXXII,So stoutly.  Whence like two enraged goats
3207,CANTO XXXII,They clash'd together; them such fury seiz'd.
3208,CANTO XXXII,
3209,CANTO XXXII,"And one, from whom the cold both ears had reft,"
3210,CANTO XXXII,"Exclaim'd, still looking downward: ""Why on us"
3211,CANTO XXXII,Dost speculate so long?  If thou wouldst know
3212,CANTO XXXII,"Who are these two, the valley, whence his wave"
3213,CANTO XXXII,"Bisenzio slopes, did for its master own"
3214,CANTO XXXII,"Their sire Alberto, and next him themselves."
3215,CANTO XXXII,They from one body issued; and throughout
3216,CANTO XXXII,"Caina thou mayst search, nor find a shade"
3217,CANTO XXXII,"More worthy in congealment to be fix'd,"

3220,CANTO XXXII,"No not this spirit, whose o'erjutting head"

3222,CANTO XXXII,"Of Mascheroni: Tuscan if thou be,"
3223,CANTO XXXII,Well knowest who he was: and to cut short
3224,CANTO XXXII,"All further question, in my form behold"
3225,CANTO XXXII,What once was Camiccione.  I await
3226,CANTO XXXII,"Carlino here my kinsman, whose deep guilt"
3227,CANTO XXXII,"Shall wash out mine.""  A thousand visages"
3228,CANTO XXXII,"Then mark'd I, which the keen and eager cold"
3229,CANTO XXXII,Had shap'd into a doggish grin; whence creeps
3230,CANTO XXXII,"A shiv'ring horror o'er me, at the thought"
3231,CANTO XXXII,Of those frore shallows.  While we journey'd on
3232,CANTO XXXII,"Toward the middle, at whose point unites"
3233,CANTO XXXII,"All heavy substance, and I trembling went"
3234,CANTO XXXII,"Through that eternal chillness, I know not"
3235,CANTO XXXII,"If will it were or destiny, or chance,"
3236,CANTO XXXII,"But, passing 'midst the heads, my foot did strike"
3237,CANTO XXXII,With violent blow against the face of one.
3238,CANTO XXXII,
3239,CANTO XXXII,"""Wherefore dost bruise me?"" weeping, he exclaim'd,"
3240,CANTO XXXII,"""Unless thy errand be some fresh revenge"
3241,CANTO XXXII,"For Montaperto, wherefore troublest me?"""
3242,CANTO XXXII,
3243,CANTO XXXII,"I thus: ""Instructor, now await me here,"
3244,CANTO XXXII,That I through him may rid me of my doubt.
3245,CANTO XXXII,"Thenceforth what haste thou wilt.""  The teacher paus'd,"
3246,CANTO XXXII,"And to that shade I spake, who bitterly"
3247,CANTO XXXII,"Still curs'd me in his wrath.  ""What art thou, speak,"
3248,CANTO XXXII,"That railest thus on others?""  He replied:"
3249,CANTO XXXII,"""Now who art thou, that smiting others' cheeks"
3250,CANTO XXXII,"Through Antenora roamest, with such force"
3251,CANTO XXXII,"As were past suff'rance, wert thou living still?"""
3252,CANTO XXXII,
3253,CANTO XXXII,"""And I am living, to thy joy perchance,"""
3254,CANTO XXXII,"Was my reply, ""if fame be dear to thee,"
3255,CANTO XXXII,"That with the rest I may thy name enrol."""
3256,CANTO XXXII,
3257,CANTO XXXII,"""The contrary of what I covet most,"""
3258,CANTO XXXII,"Said he, ""thou tender'st: hence; nor vex me more."
3259,CANTO XXXII,"Ill knowest thou to flatter in this vale."""
3260,CANTO XXXII,
3261,CANTO XXXII,"Then seizing on his hinder scalp, I cried:"
3262,CANTO XXXII,"""Name thee, or not a hair shall tarry here."""
3263,CANTO XXXII,
3264,CANTO XXXII,"""Rend all away,"" he answer'd, ""yet for that"
3265,CANTO XXXII,"I will not tell nor show thee who I am,"
3266,CANTO XXXII,"Though at my head thou pluck a thousand times."""
3267,CANTO XXXII,
3268,CANTO XXXII,"Now I had grasp'd his tresses, and stript off"
3269,CANTO XXXII,"More than one tuft, he barking, with his eyes"
3270,CANTO XXXII,"Drawn in and downward, when another cried,"
3271,CANTO XXXII,"""What ails thee, Bocca?  Sound not loud enough"
3272,CANTO XXXII,"Thy chatt'ring teeth, but thou must bark outright?"
3273,CANTO XXXII,"What devil wrings thee?""--""Now,"" said I, ""be dumb,"
3274,CANTO XXXII,Accursed traitor! to thy shame of thee
3275,CANTO XXXII,"True tidings will I bear.""--""Off,"" he replied,"
3276,CANTO XXXII,"""Tell what thou list; but as thou escape from hence"
3277,CANTO XXXII,"To speak of him whose tongue hath been so glib,"
3278,CANTO XXXII,Forget not: here he wails the Frenchman's gold.
3279,CANTO XXXII,"'Him of Duera,' thou canst say, 'I mark'd,"
3280,CANTO XXXII,Where the starv'd sinners pine.'  If thou be ask'd
3281,CANTO XXXII,"What other shade was with them, at thy side"
3282,CANTO XXXII,"Is Beccaria, whose red gorge distain'd"
3283,CANTO XXXII,"The biting axe of Florence.  Farther on,"
3284,CANTO XXXII,"If I misdeem not, Soldanieri bides,"
3285,CANTO XXXII,"With Ganellon, and Tribaldello, him"
3286,CANTO XXXII,"Who op'd Faenza when the people slept."""
3287,CANTO XXXII,
3288,CANTO XXXII,"We now had left him, passing on our way,"
3289,CANTO XXXII,When I beheld two spirits by the ice
3290,CANTO XXXII,"Pent in one hollow, that the head of one"
3291,CANTO XXXII,Was cowl unto the other; and as bread
3292,CANTO XXXII,"Is raven'd up through hunger, th' uppermost"
3293,CANTO XXXII,"Did so apply his fangs to th' other's brain,"
3294,CANTO XXXII,Where the spine joins it.  Not more furiously
3295,CANTO XXXII,"On Menalippus' temples Tydeus gnaw'd,"
3296,CANTO XXXII,Than on that skull and on its garbage he.
3297,CANTO XXXII,
3298,CANTO XXXII,"""O thou who show'st so beastly sign of hate"
3299,CANTO XXXII,"'Gainst him thou prey'st on, let me hear,"" said I"
3300,CANTO XXXII,"""The cause, on such condition, that if right"
3301,CANTO XXXII,"Warrant thy grievance, knowing who ye are,"
3302,CANTO XXXII,"And what the colour of his sinning was,"
3303,CANTO XXXII,"I may repay thee in the world above,"
3304,CANTO XXXII,"If that, wherewith I speak be moist so long."""
3305,CANTO XXXII,
3306,CANTO XXXII,
3307,CANTO XXXII,
3308,CANTO XXXII,
3309,CANTO XXXIII,CANTO XXXIII
3310,CANTO XXXIII,
3311,CANTO XXXIII,"HIS jaws uplifting from their fell repast,"
3312,CANTO XXXIII,"That sinner wip'd them on the hairs o' th' head,"
3313,CANTO XXXIII,"Which he behind had mangled, then began:"
3314,CANTO XXXIII,"""Thy will obeying, I call up afresh"
3315,CANTO XXXIII,"Sorrow past cure, which but to think of wrings"
3316,CANTO XXXIII,"My heart, or ere I tell on't. But if words,"
3317,CANTO XXXIII,"That I may utter, shall prove seed to bear"
3318,CANTO XXXIII,"Fruit of eternal infamy to him,"
3319,CANTO XXXIII,"The traitor whom I gnaw at, thou at once"
3320,CANTO XXXIII,Shalt see me speak and weep.  Who thou mayst be
3321,CANTO XXXIII,"I know not, nor how here below art come:"
3322,CANTO XXXIII,"But Florentine thou seemest of a truth,"
3323,CANTO XXXIII,When I do hear thee.  Know I was on earth
3324,CANTO XXXIII,"Count Ugolino, and th' Archbishop he"
3325,CANTO XXXIII,"Ruggieri.  Why I neighbour him so close,"
3326,CANTO XXXIII,Now list.  That through effect of his ill thoughts
3327,CANTO XXXIII,"In him my trust reposing, I was ta'en"
3328,CANTO XXXIII,"And after murder'd, need is not I tell."
3329,CANTO XXXIII,"What therefore thou canst not have heard, that is,"
3330,CANTO XXXIII,"How cruel was the murder, shalt thou hear,"
3331,CANTO XXXIII,And know if he have wrong'd me.  A small grate
3332,CANTO XXXIII,"Within that mew, which for my sake the name"
3333,CANTO XXXIII,"Of famine bears, where others yet must pine,"
3334,CANTO XXXIII,Already through its opening sev'ral moons
3335,CANTO XXXIII,"Had shown me, when I slept the evil sleep,"
3336,CANTO XXXIII,That from the future tore the curtain off.
3337,CANTO XXXIII,"This one, methought, as master of the sport,"
3338,CANTO XXXIII,Rode forth to chase the gaunt wolf and his whelps
3339,CANTO XXXIII,"Unto the mountain, which forbids the sight"
3340,CANTO XXXIII,Of Lucca to the Pisan.  With lean brachs
3341,CANTO XXXIII,"Inquisitive and keen, before him rang'd"
3342,CANTO XXXIII,Lanfranchi with Sismondi and Gualandi.
3343,CANTO XXXIII,After short course the father and the sons
3344,CANTO XXXIII,"Seem'd tir'd and lagging, and methought I saw"
3345,CANTO XXXIII,The sharp tusks gore their sides.  When I awoke
3346,CANTO XXXIII,"Before the dawn, amid their sleep I heard"
3347,CANTO XXXIII,My sons (for they were with me) weep and ask
3348,CANTO XXXIII,"For bread.  Right cruel art thou, if no pang"
3349,CANTO XXXIII,Thou feel at thinking what my heart foretold;
3350,CANTO XXXIII,"And if not now, why use thy tears to flow?"
3351,CANTO XXXIII,Now had they waken'd; and the hour drew near
3352,CANTO XXXIII,When they were wont to bring us food; the mind
3353,CANTO XXXIII,"Of each misgave him through his dream, and I"
3354,CANTO XXXIII,"Heard, at its outlet underneath lock'd up"
3355,CANTO XXXIII,The' horrible tower: whence uttering not a word
3356,CANTO XXXIII,I look'd upon the visage of my sons.
3357,CANTO XXXIII,I wept not: so all stone I felt within.
3358,CANTO XXXIII,"They wept: and one, my little Anslem, cried:"
3359,CANTO XXXIII,"""Thou lookest so!  Father what ails thee?""  Yet"
3360,CANTO XXXIII,"I shed no tear, nor answer'd all that day"
3361,CANTO XXXIII,"Nor the next night, until another sun"
3362,CANTO XXXIII,Came out upon the world.  When a faint beam
3363,CANTO XXXIII,"Had to our doleful prison made its way,"
3364,CANTO XXXIII,And in four countenances I descry'd
3365,CANTO XXXIII,"The image of my own, on either hand"
3366,CANTO XXXIII,"Through agony I bit, and they who thought"
3367,CANTO XXXIII,"I did it through desire of feeding, rose"
3368,CANTO XXXIII,"O' th' sudden, and cried, 'Father, we should grieve"
3369,CANTO XXXIII,"Far less, if thou wouldst eat of us: thou gav'st"
3370,CANTO XXXIII,"These weeds of miserable flesh we wear,"
3371,CANTO XXXIII,
3372,CANTO XXXIII,'And do thou strip them off from us again.'
3373,CANTO XXXIII,"Then, not to make them sadder, I kept down"
3374,CANTO XXXIII,My spirit in stillness.  That day and the next
3375,CANTO XXXIII,"We all were silent.  Ah, obdurate earth!"
3376,CANTO XXXIII,Why open'dst not upon us?  When we came
3377,CANTO XXXIII,"To the fourth day, then Geddo at my feet"
3378,CANTO XXXIII,"Outstretch'd did fling him, crying, 'Hast no help"
3379,CANTO XXXIII,"For me, my father!'  There he died, and e'en"
3380,CANTO XXXIII,"Plainly as thou seest me, saw I the three"
3381,CANTO XXXIII,Fall one by one 'twixt the fifth day and sixth:
3382,CANTO XXXIII,
3383,CANTO XXXIII,"""Whence I betook me now grown blind to grope"
3384,CANTO XXXIII,"Over them all, and for three days aloud"
3385,CANTO XXXIII,Call'd on them who were dead.  Then fasting got
3386,CANTO XXXIII,"The mastery of grief.""  Thus having spoke,"
3387,CANTO XXXIII,
3388,CANTO XXXIII,Once more upon the wretched skull his teeth
3389,CANTO XXXIII,"He fasten'd, like a mastiff's 'gainst the bone"
3390,CANTO XXXIII,Firm and unyielding.  Oh thou Pisa! shame
3391,CANTO XXXIII,"Of all the people, who their dwelling make"
3392,CANTO XXXIII,"In that fair region, where th' Italian voice"
3393,CANTO XXXIII,"Is heard, since that thy neighbours are so slack"
3394,CANTO XXXIII,"To punish, from their deep foundations rise"
3395,CANTO XXXIII,"Capraia and Gorgona, and dam up"
3396,CANTO XXXIII,"The mouth of Arno, that each soul in thee"
3397,CANTO XXXIII,May perish in the waters!  What if fame
3398,CANTO XXXIII,Reported that thy castles were betray'd
3399,CANTO XXXIII,"By Ugolino, yet no right hadst thou"
3400,CANTO XXXIII,"To stretch his children on the rack.  For them,"
3401,CANTO XXXIII,"Brigata, Ugaccione, and the pair"
3402,CANTO XXXIII,"Of gentle ones, of whom my song hath told,"
3403,CANTO XXXIII,"Their tender years, thou modern Thebes! did make"
3404,CANTO XXXIII,"Uncapable of guilt.  Onward we pass'd,"
3405,CANTO XXXIII,Where others skarf'd in rugged folds of ice
3406,CANTO XXXIII,"Not on their feet were turn'd, but each revers'd."
3407,CANTO XXXIII,
3408,CANTO XXXIII,There very weeping suffers not to weep;
3409,CANTO XXXIII,For at their eyes grief seeking passage finds
3410,CANTO XXXIII,"Impediment, and rolling inward turns"
3411,CANTO XXXIII,For increase of sharp anguish: the first tears
3412,CANTO XXXIII,"Hang cluster'd, and like crystal vizors show,"
3413,CANTO XXXIII,Under the socket brimming all the cup.
3414,CANTO XXXIII,
3415,CANTO XXXIII,Now though the cold had from my face dislodg'd
3416,CANTO XXXIII,"Each feeling, as 't were callous, yet me seem'd"
3417,CANTO XXXIII,"Some breath of wind I felt.  ""Whence cometh this,"""
3418,CANTO XXXIII,"Said I, ""my master?  Is not here below"
3419,CANTO XXXIII,"All vapour quench'd?""--""'Thou shalt be speedily,"""
3420,CANTO XXXIII,"He answer'd, ""where thine eye shall tell thee whence"
3421,CANTO XXXIII,"The cause descrying of this airy shower."""
3422,CANTO XXXIII,
3423,CANTO XXXIII,Then cried out one in the chill crust who mourn'd:
3424,CANTO XXXIII,"""O souls so cruel! that the farthest post"
3425,CANTO XXXIII,"Hath been assign'd you, from this face remove"
3426,CANTO XXXIII,"The harden'd veil, that I may vent the grief"
3427,CANTO XXXIII,"Impregnate at my heart, some little space"
3428,CANTO XXXIII,"Ere it congeal again!""  I thus replied:"
3429,CANTO XXXIII,"""Say who thou wast, if thou wouldst have mine aid;"
3430,CANTO XXXIII,"And if I extricate thee not, far down"
3431,CANTO XXXIII,"As to the lowest ice may I descend!"""
3432,CANTO XXXIII,
3433,CANTO XXXIII,"""The friar Alberigo,"" answered he,"
3434,CANTO XXXIII,"""Am I, who from the evil garden pluck'd"
3435,CANTO XXXIII,"Its fruitage, and am here repaid, the date"
3436,CANTO XXXIII,"More luscious for my fig.""--""Hah!""  I exclaim'd,"
3437,CANTO XXXIII,"""Art thou too dead!""--""How in the world aloft"
3438,CANTO XXXIII,"It fareth with my body,"" answer'd he,"
3439,CANTO XXXIII,"""I am right ignorant.  Such privilege"
3440,CANTO XXXIII,"Hath Ptolomea, that ofttimes the soul"
3441,CANTO XXXIII,"Drops hither, ere by Atropos divorc'd."
3442,CANTO XXXIII,And that thou mayst wipe out more willingly
3443,CANTO XXXIII,"The glazed tear-drops that o'erlay mine eyes,"
3444,CANTO XXXIII,"Know that the soul, that moment she betrays,"
3445,CANTO XXXIII,"As I did, yields her body to a fiend"
3446,CANTO XXXIII,"Who after moves and governs it at will,"
3447,CANTO XXXIII,Till all its time be rounded; headlong she
3448,CANTO XXXIII,Falls to this cistern.  And perchance above
3449,CANTO XXXIII,"Doth yet appear the body of a ghost,"
3450,CANTO XXXIII,"Who here behind me winters.  Him thou know'st,"
3451,CANTO XXXIII,If thou but newly art arriv'd below.
3452,CANTO XXXIII,"The years are many that have pass'd away,"
3453,CANTO XXXIII,"Since to this fastness Branca Doria came."""
3454,CANTO XXXIII,
3455,CANTO XXXIII,"""Now,"" answer'd I, ""methinks thou mockest me,"
3456,CANTO XXXIII,"For Branca Doria never yet hath died,"
3457,CANTO XXXIII,"But doth all natural functions of a man,"
3458,CANTO XXXIII,"Eats, drinks, and sleeps, and putteth raiment on."""
3459,CANTO XXXIII,
3460,CANTO XXXIII,"He thus: ""Not yet unto that upper foss"
3461,CANTO XXXIII,"By th' evil talons guarded, where the pitch"
3462,CANTO XXXIII,"Tenacious boils, had Michael Zanche reach'd,"
3463,CANTO XXXIII,When this one left a demon in his stead
3464,CANTO XXXIII,"In his own body, and of one his kin,"
3465,CANTO XXXIII,Who with him treachery wrought.  But now put forth
3466,CANTO XXXIII,"Thy hand, and ope mine eyes.""  I op'd them not."
3467,CANTO XXXIII,Ill manners were best courtesy to him.
3468,CANTO XXXIII,
3469,CANTO XXXIII,"Ah Genoese! men perverse in every way,"
3470,CANTO XXXIII,"With every foulness stain'd, why from the earth"
3471,CANTO XXXIII,Are ye not cancel'd?  Such an one of yours
3472,CANTO XXXIII,"I with Romagna's darkest spirit found,"
3473,CANTO XXXIII,As for his doings even now in soul
3474,CANTO XXXIII,"Is in Cocytus plung'd, and yet doth seem"
3475,CANTO XXXIII,In body still alive upon the earth.
3476,CANTO XXXIII,
3477,CANTO XXXIII,
3478,CANTO XXXIII,
3479,CANTO XXXIII,
3480,CANTO XXXIV,CANTO XXXIV
3481,CANTO XXXIV,
3482,CANTO XXXIV,"""THE banners of Hell's Monarch do come forth"
3483,CANTO XXXIV,"Towards us; therefore look,"" so spake my guide,"
3484,CANTO XXXIV,"""If thou discern him.""  As, when breathes a cloud"
3485,CANTO XXXIV,"Heavy and dense, or when the shades of night"
3486,CANTO XXXIV,"Fall on our hemisphere, seems view'd from far"
3487,CANTO XXXIV,"A windmill, which the blast stirs briskly round,"
3488,CANTO XXXIV,"Such was the fabric then methought I saw,"
3489,CANTO XXXIV,
3490,CANTO XXXIV,"To shield me from the wind, forthwith I drew"
3491,CANTO XXXIV,Behind my guide: no covert else was there.
3492,CANTO XXXIV,
3493,CANTO XXXIV,Now came I (and with fear I bid my strain
3494,CANTO XXXIV,Record the marvel) where the souls were all
3495,CANTO XXXIV,"Whelm'd underneath, transparent, as through glass"
3496,CANTO XXXIV,"Pellucid the frail stem.  Some prone were laid,"
3497,CANTO XXXIV,"Others stood upright, this upon the soles,"
3498,CANTO XXXIV,"That on his head, a third with face to feet"
3499,CANTO XXXIV,"Arch'd like a bow.  When to the point we came,"
3500,CANTO XXXIV,Whereat my guide was pleas'd that I should see
3501,CANTO XXXIV,"The creature eminent in beauty once,"
3502,CANTO XXXIV,He from before me stepp'd and made me pause.
3503,CANTO XXXIV,
3504,CANTO XXXIV,"""Lo!""  he exclaim'd, ""lo Dis! and lo the place,"
3505,CANTO XXXIV,"Where thou hast need to arm thy heart with strength."""
3506,CANTO XXXIV,
3507,CANTO XXXIV,"How frozen and how faint I then became,"
3508,CANTO XXXIV,"Ask me not, reader! for I write it not,"
3509,CANTO XXXIV,Since words would fail to tell thee of my state.
3510,CANTO XXXIV,I was not dead nor living.  Think thyself
3511,CANTO XXXIV,"If quick conception work in thee at all,"
3512,CANTO XXXIV,"How I did feel.  That emperor, who sways"
3513,CANTO XXXIV,"The realm of sorrow, at mid breast from th' ice"
3514,CANTO XXXIV,Stood forth; and I in stature am more like
3515,CANTO XXXIV,"A giant, than the giants are in his arms."
3516,CANTO XXXIV,"Mark now how great that whole must be, which suits"
3517,CANTO XXXIV,With such a part.  If he were beautiful
3518,CANTO XXXIV,"As he is hideous now, and yet did dare"
3519,CANTO XXXIV,"To scowl upon his Maker, well from him"
3520,CANTO XXXIV,May all our mis'ry flow.  Oh what a sight!
3521,CANTO XXXIV,"How passing strange it seem'd, when I did spy"
3522,CANTO XXXIV,Upon his head three faces: one in front
3523,CANTO XXXIV,"Of hue vermilion, th' other two with this"
3524,CANTO XXXIV,Midway each shoulder join'd and at the crest;
3525,CANTO XXXIV,The right 'twixt wan and yellow seem'd: the left
3526,CANTO XXXIV,"To look on, such as come from whence old Nile"
3527,CANTO XXXIV,Stoops to the lowlands.  Under each shot forth
3528,CANTO XXXIV,"Two mighty wings, enormous as became"
3529,CANTO XXXIV,A bird so vast.  Sails never such I saw
3530,CANTO XXXIV,"Outstretch'd on the wide sea.  No plumes had they,"
3531,CANTO XXXIV,"But were in texture like a bat, and these"
3532,CANTO XXXIV,"He flapp'd i' th' air, that from him issued still"
3533,CANTO XXXIV,"Three winds, wherewith Cocytus to its depth"
3534,CANTO XXXIV,Was frozen.  At six eyes he wept: the tears
3535,CANTO XXXIV,Adown three chins distill'd with bloody foam.
3536,CANTO XXXIV,At every mouth his teeth a sinner champ'd
3537,CANTO XXXIV,"Bruis'd as with pond'rous engine, so that three"
3538,CANTO XXXIV,Were in this guise tormented.  But far more
3539,CANTO XXXIV,"Than from that gnawing, was the foremost pang'd"
3540,CANTO XXXIV,"By the fierce rending, whence ofttimes the back"
3541,CANTO XXXIV,"Was stript of all its skin.  ""That upper spirit,"
3542,CANTO XXXIV,"Who hath worse punishment,"" so spake my guide,"
3543,CANTO XXXIV,"""Is Judas, he that hath his head within"
3544,CANTO XXXIV,"And plies the feet without.  Of th' other two,"
3545,CANTO XXXIV,"Whose heads are under, from the murky jaw"
3546,CANTO XXXIV,"Who hangs, is Brutus: lo! how he doth writhe"
3547,CANTO XXXIV,"And speaks not!  Th' other Cassius, that appears"
3548,CANTO XXXIV,"So large of limb.  But night now re-ascends,"
3549,CANTO XXXIV,"And it is time for parting.  All is seen."""
3550,CANTO XXXIV,
3551,CANTO XXXIV,"I clipp'd him round the neck, for so he bade;"
3552,CANTO XXXIV,"And noting time and place, he, when the wings"
3553,CANTO XXXIV,"Enough were op'd, caught fast the shaggy sides,"
3554,CANTO XXXIV,And down from pile to pile descending stepp'd
3555,CANTO XXXIV,Between the thick fell and the jagged ice.
3556,CANTO XXXIV,
3557,CANTO XXXIV,"Soon as he reach'd the point, whereat the thigh"
3558,CANTO XXXIV,"Upon the swelling of the haunches turns,"
3559,CANTO XXXIV,My leader there with pain and struggling hard
3560,CANTO XXXIV,"Turn'd round his head, where his feet stood before,"
3561,CANTO XXXIV,"And grappled at the fell, as one who mounts,"
3562,CANTO XXXIV,That into hell methought we turn'd again.
3563,CANTO XXXIV,
3564,CANTO XXXIV,"""Expect that by such stairs as these,"" thus spake"
3565,CANTO XXXIV,"The teacher, panting like a man forespent,"
3566,CANTO XXXIV,"""We must depart from evil so extreme."""
3567,CANTO XXXIV,"Then at a rocky opening issued forth,"
3568,CANTO XXXIV,"And plac'd me on a brink to sit, next join'd"
3569,CANTO XXXIV,"With wary step my side.  I rais'd mine eyes,"
3570,CANTO XXXIV,Believing that I Lucifer should see
3571,CANTO XXXIV,"Where he was lately left, but saw him now"
3572,CANTO XXXIV,"With legs held upward.  Let the grosser sort,"
3573,CANTO XXXIV,"Who see not what the point was I had pass'd,"
3574,CANTO XXXIV,Bethink them if sore toil oppress'd me then.
3575,CANTO XXXIV,
3576,CANTO XXXIV,"""Arise,"" my master cried, ""upon thy feet."
3577,CANTO XXXIV,"The way is long, and much uncouth the road;"
3578,CANTO XXXIV,And now within one hour and half of noon
3579,CANTO XXXIV,"The sun returns.""  It was no palace-hall"
3580,CANTO XXXIV,"Lofty and luminous wherein we stood,"
3581,CANTO XXXIV,But natural dungeon where ill footing was
3582,CANTO XXXIV,"And scant supply of light.  ""Ere from th' abyss"
3583,CANTO XXXIV,"I sep'rate,"" thus when risen I began,"
3584,CANTO XXXIV,"""My guide! vouchsafe few words to set me free"
3585,CANTO XXXIV,From error's thralldom.  Where is now the ice?
3586,CANTO XXXIV,How standeth he in posture thus revers'd?
3587,CANTO XXXIV,And how from eve to morn in space so brief
3588,CANTO XXXIV,"Hath the sun made his transit?""  He in few"
3589,CANTO XXXIV,"Thus answering spake: ""Thou deemest thou art still"
3590,CANTO XXXIV,"On th' other side the centre, where I grasp'd"
3591,CANTO XXXIV,"Th' abhorred worm, that boreth through the world."
3592,CANTO XXXIV,"Thou wast on th' other side, so long as I"
3593,CANTO XXXIV,"Descended; when I turn'd, thou didst o'erpass"
3594,CANTO XXXIV,"That point, to which from ev'ry part is dragg'd"
3595,CANTO XXXIV,All heavy substance.  Thou art now arriv'd
3596,CANTO XXXIV,"Under the hemisphere opposed to that,"
3597,CANTO XXXIV,"Which the great continent doth overspread,"
3598,CANTO XXXIV,And underneath whose canopy expir'd
3599,CANTO XXXIV,"The Man, that was born sinless, and so liv'd."
3600,CANTO XXXIV,"Thy feet are planted on the smallest sphere,"
3601,CANTO XXXIV,Whose other aspect is Judecca.  Morn
3602,CANTO XXXIV,"Here rises, when there evening sets: and he,"
3603,CANTO XXXIV,"Whose shaggy pile was scal'd, yet standeth fix'd,"
3604,CANTO XXXIV,As at the first.  On this part he fell down
3605,CANTO XXXIV,"From heav'n; and th' earth, here prominent before,"
3606,CANTO XXXIV,"Through fear of him did veil her with the sea,"
3607,CANTO XXXIV,And to our hemisphere retir'd.  Perchance
3608,CANTO XXXIV,To shun him was the vacant space left here
3609,CANTO XXXIV,"By what of firm land on this side appears,"
3610,CANTO XXXIV,"That sprang aloof.""  There is a place beneath,"
3611,CANTO XXXIV,"From Belzebub as distant, as extends"
3612,CANTO XXXIV,"The vaulted tomb, discover'd not by sight,"
3613,CANTO XXXIV,"But by the sound of brooklet, that descends"
3614,CANTO XXXIV,"This way along the hollow of a rock,"
3615,CANTO XXXIV,"Which, as it winds with no precipitous course,"
3616,CANTO XXXIV,The wave hath eaten.  By that hidden way
3617,CANTO XXXIV,"My guide and I did enter, to return"
3618,CANTO XXXIV,To the fair world: and heedless of repose
3619,CANTO XXXIV,"We climbed, he first, I following his steps,"
3620,CANTO XXXIV,Till on our view the beautiful lights of heav'n
3621,CANTO XXXIV,Dawn'd through a circular opening in the cave:
3622,CANTO XXXIV,Thus issuing we again beheld the stars.
