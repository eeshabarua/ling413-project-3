133,INTRODUCTION.,INTRODUCTION.
134,INTRODUCTION.,
135,INTRODUCTION.,
136,INTRODUCTION.,"Scepticism is as much the result of knowledge, as knowledge is of"
137,INTRODUCTION.,"scepticism. To be content with what we at present know, is, for the"
138,INTRODUCTION.,"most part, to shut our ears against conviction; since, from the very"
139,INTRODUCTION.,"gradual character of our education, we must continually forget, and"
140,INTRODUCTION.,"emancipate ourselves from, knowledge previously acquired; we must set"
141,INTRODUCTION.,"aside old notions and embrace fresh ones; and, as we learn, we must be"
142,INTRODUCTION.,daily unlearning something which it has cost us no small labour and
143,INTRODUCTION.,anxiety to acquire.
144,INTRODUCTION.,
145,INTRODUCTION.,And this difficulty attaches itself more closely to an age in which
146,INTRODUCTION.,"progress has gained a strong ascendency over prejudice, and in which"
147,INTRODUCTION.,"persons and things are, day by day, finding their real level, in lieu"
148,INTRODUCTION.,of their conventional value. The same principles which have swept away
149,INTRODUCTION.,"traditional abuses, and which are making rapid havoc among the revenues"
150,INTRODUCTION.,"of sinecurists, and stripping the thin, tawdry veil from attractive"
151,INTRODUCTION.,"superstitions, are working as actively in literature as in society. The"
152,INTRODUCTION.,"credulity of one writer, or the partiality of another, finds as"
153,INTRODUCTION.,powerful a touchstone and as wholesome a chastisement in the healthy
154,INTRODUCTION.,"scepticism of a temperate class of antagonists, as the dreams of"
155,INTRODUCTION.,"conservatism, or the impostures of pluralist sinecures in the Church."
156,INTRODUCTION.,"History and tradition, whether of ancient or comparatively recent"
157,INTRODUCTION.,"times, are subjected to very different handling from that which the"
158,INTRODUCTION.,indulgence or credulity of former ages could allow. Mere statements are
159,INTRODUCTION.,"jealously watched, and the motives of the writer form as important an"
160,INTRODUCTION.,"ingredient in the analysis of his history, as the facts he records."
161,INTRODUCTION.,Probability is a powerful and troublesome test; and it is by this
162,INTRODUCTION.,troublesome standard that a large portion of historical evidence is
163,INTRODUCTION.,sifted. Consistency is no less pertinacious and exacting in its
164,INTRODUCTION.,"demands. In brief, to write a history, we must know more than mere"
165,INTRODUCTION.,"facts. Human nature, viewed under an induction of extended experience,"
166,INTRODUCTION.,is the best help to the criticism of human history. Historical
167,INTRODUCTION.,characters can only be estimated by the standard which human
168,INTRODUCTION.,"experience, whether actual or traditionary, has furnished. To form"
169,INTRODUCTION.,correct views of individuals we must regard them as forming parts of a
170,INTRODUCTION.,great whole—we must measure them by their relation to the mass of
171,INTRODUCTION.,"beings by whom they are surrounded, and, in contemplating the incidents"
172,INTRODUCTION.,"in their lives or condition which tradition has handed down to us, we"
173,INTRODUCTION.,"must rather consider the general bearing of the whole narrative, than"
174,INTRODUCTION.,the respective probability of its details.
175,INTRODUCTION.,
176,INTRODUCTION.,"It is unfortunate for us, that, of some of the greatest men, we know"
177,INTRODUCTION.,"least, and talk most. Homer, Socrates, and Shakespere[1] have, perhaps,"
178,INTRODUCTION.,contributed more to the intellectual enlightenment of mankind than any
179,INTRODUCTION.,"other three writers who could be named, and yet the history of all"
180,INTRODUCTION.,"three has given rise to a boundless ocean of discussion, which has left"
181,INTRODUCTION.,us little save the option of choosing which theory or theories we will
182,INTRODUCTION.,"follow. The personality of Shakespere is, perhaps, the only thing in"
183,INTRODUCTION.,which critics will allow us to believe without controversy; but upon
184,INTRODUCTION.,"everything else, even down to the authorship of plays, there is more or"
185,INTRODUCTION.,less of doubt and uncertainty. Of Socrates we know as little as the
186,INTRODUCTION.,contradictions of Plato and Xenophon will allow us to know. He was one
187,INTRODUCTION.,of the _dramatis personæ_ in two dramas as unlike in principles as in
188,INTRODUCTION.,style. He appears as the enunciator of opinions as different in their
189,INTRODUCTION.,tone as those of the writers who have handed them down. When we have
190,INTRODUCTION.,"read Plato _or_ Xenophon, we think we know something of Socrates; when"
191,INTRODUCTION.,"we have fairly read and examined both, we feel convinced that we are"
192,INTRODUCTION.,something worse than ignorant.
193,INTRODUCTION.,
194,INTRODUCTION.,"It has been an easy, and a popular expedient, of late years, to deny"
195,INTRODUCTION.,the personal or real existence of men and things whose life and
196,INTRODUCTION.,condition were too much for our belief. This system—which has often
197,INTRODUCTION.,"comforted the religious sceptic, and substituted the consolations of"
198,INTRODUCTION.,Strauss for those of the New Testament—has been of incalculable value
199,INTRODUCTION.,to the historical theorists of the last and present centuries. To
200,INTRODUCTION.,"question the existence of Alexander the Great, would be a more"
201,INTRODUCTION.,"excusable act, than to believe in that of Romulus. To deny a fact"
202,INTRODUCTION.,"related in Herodotus, because it is inconsistent with a theory"
203,INTRODUCTION.,developed from an Assyrian inscription which no two scholars read in
204,INTRODUCTION.,"the same way, is more pardonable, than to believe in the good-natured"
205,INTRODUCTION.,old king whom the elegant pen of Florian has idealized—_Numa
206,INTRODUCTION.,Pompilius._
207,INTRODUCTION.,
208,INTRODUCTION.,"Scepticism has attained its culminating point with respect to Homer,"
209,INTRODUCTION.,and the state of our Homeric knowledge may be described as a free
210,INTRODUCTION.,"permission to believe any theory, provided we throw overboard all"
211,INTRODUCTION.,"written tradition, concerning the author or authors of the Iliad and"
212,INTRODUCTION.,"Odyssey. What few authorities exist on the subject, are summarily"
213,INTRODUCTION.,"dismissed, although the arguments appear to run in a circle. “This"
214,INTRODUCTION.,"cannot be true, because it is not true; and, that is not true, because"
215,INTRODUCTION.,"it cannot be true.” Such seems to be the style, in which testimony upon"
216,INTRODUCTION.,"testimony, statement upon statement, is consigned to denial and"
217,INTRODUCTION.,oblivion.
218,INTRODUCTION.,
219,INTRODUCTION.,"It is, however, unfortunate that the professed biographies of Homer are"
220,INTRODUCTION.,"partly forgeries, partly freaks of ingenuity and imagination, in which"
221,INTRODUCTION.,truth is the requisite most wanting. Before taking a brief review of
222,INTRODUCTION.,"the Homeric theory in its present conditions, some notice must be taken"
223,INTRODUCTION.,of the treatise on the Life of Homer which has been attributed to
224,INTRODUCTION.,Herodotus.
225,INTRODUCTION.,
226,INTRODUCTION.,"According to this document, the city of Cumæ in Æolia, was, at an"
227,INTRODUCTION.,"early period, the seat of frequent immigrations from various parts of"
228,INTRODUCTION.,"Greece. Among the immigrants was Menapolus, the son of Ithagenes."
229,INTRODUCTION.,"Although poor, he married, and the result of the union was a girl named"
230,INTRODUCTION.,"Critheïs. The girl was left an orphan at an early age, under the"
231,INTRODUCTION.,"guardianship of Cleanax, of Argos. It is to the indiscretion of this"
232,INTRODUCTION.,maiden that we “are indebted for so much happiness.” Homer was the
233,INTRODUCTION.,"first fruit of her juvenile frailty, and received the name of"
234,INTRODUCTION.,"Melesigenes, from having been born near the river Meles, in Bœotia,"
235,INTRODUCTION.,whither Critheïs had been transported in order to save her reputation.
236,INTRODUCTION.,
237,INTRODUCTION.,"“At this time,” continues our narrative, “there lived at Smyrna a man"
238,INTRODUCTION.,"named Phemius, a teacher of literature and music, who, not being"
239,INTRODUCTION.,"married, engaged Critheïs to manage his household, and spin the flax he"
240,INTRODUCTION.,received as the price of his scholastic labours. So satisfactory was
241,INTRODUCTION.,"her performance of this task, and so modest her conduct, that he made"
242,INTRODUCTION.,"proposals of marriage, declaring himself, as a further inducement,"
243,INTRODUCTION.,"willing to adopt her son, who, he asserted, would become a clever man,"
244,INTRODUCTION.,if he were carefully brought up.”
245,INTRODUCTION.,
246,INTRODUCTION.,They were married; careful cultivation ripened the talents which nature
247,INTRODUCTION.,"had bestowed, and Melesigenes soon surpassed his schoolfellows in every"
248,INTRODUCTION.,"attainment, and, when older, rivalled his preceptor in wisdom. Phemius"
249,INTRODUCTION.,"died, leaving him sole heir to his property, and his mother soon"
250,INTRODUCTION.,followed. Melesigenes carried on his adopted father’s school with great
251,INTRODUCTION.,"success, exciting the admiration not only of the inhabitants of Smyrna,"
252,INTRODUCTION.,"but also of the strangers whom the trade carried on there, especially"
253,INTRODUCTION.,"in the exportation of corn, attracted to that city. Among these"
254,INTRODUCTION.,"visitors, one Mentes, from Leucadia, the modern Santa Maura, who"
255,INTRODUCTION.,"evinced a knowledge and intelligence rarely found in those times,"
256,INTRODUCTION.,"persuaded Melesigenes to close his school, and accompany him on his"
257,INTRODUCTION.,"travels. He promised not only to pay his expenses, but to furnish him"
258,INTRODUCTION.,"with a further stipend, urging, that, “While he was yet young, it was"
259,INTRODUCTION.,fitting that he should see with his own eyes the countries and cities
260,INTRODUCTION.,which might hereafter be the subjects of his discourses.” Melesigenes
261,INTRODUCTION.,"consented, and set out with his patron, “examining all the curiosities"
262,INTRODUCTION.,"of the countries they visited, and informing himself of everything by"
263,INTRODUCTION.,"interrogating those whom he met.” We may also suppose, that he wrote"
264,INTRODUCTION.,memoirs of all that he deemed worthy of preservation.[2] Having set
265,INTRODUCTION.,"sail from Tyrrhenia and Iberia, they reached Ithaca. Here Melesigenes,"
266,INTRODUCTION.,"who had already suffered in his eyes, became much worse, and Mentes,"
267,INTRODUCTION.,"who was about to leave for Leucadia, left him to the medical"
268,INTRODUCTION.,"superintendence of a friend of his, named Mentor, the son of Alcinor."
269,INTRODUCTION.,"Under his hospitable and intelligent host, Melesigenes rapidly became"
270,INTRODUCTION.,"acquainted with the legends respecting Ulysses, which afterwards formed"
271,INTRODUCTION.,"the subject of the Odyssey. The inhabitants of Ithaca assert, that it"
272,INTRODUCTION.,"was here that Melesigenes became blind, but the Colophomans make their"
273,INTRODUCTION.,"city the seat of that misfortune. He then returned to Smyrna, where he"
274,INTRODUCTION.,applied himself to the study of poetry.[3]
275,INTRODUCTION.,
276,INTRODUCTION.,But poverty soon drove him to Cumæ. Having passed over the Hermæan
277,INTRODUCTION.,"plain, he arrived at Neon Teichos, the New Wall, a colony of Cumæ."
278,INTRODUCTION.,Here his misfortunes and poetical talent gained him the friendship of
279,INTRODUCTION.,"one Tychias, an armourer. “And up to my time,” continued the author,"
280,INTRODUCTION.,“the inhabitants showed the place where he used to sit when giving a
281,INTRODUCTION.,"recitation of his verses, and they greatly honoured the spot. Here also"
282,INTRODUCTION.,"a poplar grew, which they said had sprung up ever since Melesigenes"
283,INTRODUCTION.,arrived”.[4]
284,INTRODUCTION.,
285,INTRODUCTION.,"But poverty still drove him on, and he went by way of Larissa, as being"
286,INTRODUCTION.,"the most convenient road. Here, the Cumans say, he composed an epitaph"
287,INTRODUCTION.,"on Gordius, king of Phrygia, which has however, and with greater"
288,INTRODUCTION.,"probability, been attributed to Cleobulus of Lindus.[5]"
289,INTRODUCTION.,
290,INTRODUCTION.,"Arrived at Cumæ, he frequented the _converzationes_[6] of the old men,"
291,INTRODUCTION.,and delighted all by the charms of his poetry. Encouraged by this
292,INTRODUCTION.,"favourable reception, he declared that, if they would allow him a"
293,INTRODUCTION.,"public maintenance, he would render their city most gloriously"
294,INTRODUCTION.,renowned. They avowed their willingness to support him in the measure
295,INTRODUCTION.,"he proposed, and procured him an audience in the council. Having made"
296,INTRODUCTION.,"the speech, with the purport of which our author has forgotten to"
297,INTRODUCTION.,"acquaint us, he retired, and left them to debate respecting the answer"
298,INTRODUCTION.,to be given to his proposal.
299,INTRODUCTION.,
300,INTRODUCTION.,The greater part of the assembly seemed favourable to the poet’s
301,INTRODUCTION.,"demand, but one man observed that “if they were to feed _Homers_, they"
302,INTRODUCTION.,would be encumbered with a multitude of useless people.” “From this
303,INTRODUCTION.,"circumstance,” says the writer, “Melesigenes acquired the name of"
304,INTRODUCTION.,"Homer, for the Cumans call blind men _Homers_.”[7] With a love of"
305,INTRODUCTION.,"economy, which shows how similar the world has always been in its"
306,INTRODUCTION.,"treatment of literary men, the pension was denied, and the poet vented"
307,INTRODUCTION.,his disappointment in a wish that Cumæa might never produce a poet
308,INTRODUCTION.,capable of giving it renown and glory.
309,INTRODUCTION.,
310,INTRODUCTION.,"At Phocœa, Homer was destined to experience another literary distress."
311,INTRODUCTION.,"One Thestorides, who aimed at the reputation of poetical genius, kept"
312,INTRODUCTION.,"Homer in his own house, and allowed him a pittance, on condition of the"
313,INTRODUCTION.,verses of the poet passing in his name. Having collected sufficient
314,INTRODUCTION.,"poetry to be profitable, Thestorides, like some would-be-literary"
315,INTRODUCTION.,"publishers, neglected the man whose brains he had sucked, and left him."
316,INTRODUCTION.,"At his departure, Homer is said to have observed: “O Thestorides, of"
317,INTRODUCTION.,"the many things hidden from the knowledge of man, nothing is more"
318,INTRODUCTION.,unintelligible than the human heart.”[8]
319,INTRODUCTION.,
320,INTRODUCTION.,"Homer continued his career of difficulty and distress, until some Chian"
321,INTRODUCTION.,"merchants, struck by the similarity of the verses they heard him"
322,INTRODUCTION.,"recite, acquainted him with the fact that Thestorides was pursuing a"
323,INTRODUCTION.,profitable livelihood by the recital of the very same poems. This at
324,INTRODUCTION.,once determined him to set out for Chios. No vessel happened then to be
325,INTRODUCTION.,"setting sail thither, but he found one ready to start for Erythræ, a"
326,INTRODUCTION.,"town of Ionia, which faces that island, and he prevailed upon the"
327,INTRODUCTION.,"seamen to allow him to accompany them. Having embarked, he invoked a"
328,INTRODUCTION.,"favourable wind, and prayed that he might be able to expose the"
329,INTRODUCTION.,"imposture of Thestorides, who, by his breach of hospitality, had drawn"
330,INTRODUCTION.,down the wrath of Jove the Hospitable.
331,INTRODUCTION.,
332,INTRODUCTION.,"At Erythræ, Homer fortunately met with a person who had known him in"
333,INTRODUCTION.,"Phocœa, by whose assistance he at length, after some difficulty,"
334,INTRODUCTION.,"reached the little hamlet of Pithys. Here he met with an adventure,"
335,INTRODUCTION.,which we will continue in the words of our author. “Having set out from
336,INTRODUCTION.,"Pithys, Homer went on, attracted by the cries of some goats that were"
337,INTRODUCTION.,"pasturing. The dogs barked on his approach, and he cried out. Glaucus"
338,INTRODUCTION.,"(for that was the name of the goat-herd) heard his voice, ran up"
339,INTRODUCTION.,"quickly, called off his dogs, and drove them away from Homer. For some"
340,INTRODUCTION.,time he stood wondering how a blind man should have reached such a
341,INTRODUCTION.,"place alone, and what could be his design in coming. He then went up to"
342,INTRODUCTION.,"him, and inquired who he was, and how he had come to desolate places"
343,INTRODUCTION.,"and untrodden spots, and of what he stood in need. Homer, by recounting"
344,INTRODUCTION.,"to him the whole history of his misfortunes, moved him with compassion;"
345,INTRODUCTION.,"and he took him, and led him to his cot, and having lit a fire, bade"
346,INTRODUCTION.,him sup.[9]
347,INTRODUCTION.,
348,INTRODUCTION.,"“The dogs, instead of eating, kept barking at the stranger, according"
349,INTRODUCTION.,to their usual habit. Whereupon Homer addressed Glaucus thus: O
350,INTRODUCTION.,"Glaucus, my friend, prythee attend to my behest. First give the dogs"
351,INTRODUCTION.,"their supper at the doors of the hut: for so it is better, since,"
352,INTRODUCTION.,"whilst they watch, nor thief nor wild beast will approach the fold."
353,INTRODUCTION.,
354,INTRODUCTION.,"Glaucus was pleased with the advice, and marvelled at its author."
355,INTRODUCTION.,"Having finished supper, they banqueted[10] afresh on conversation,"
356,INTRODUCTION.,"Homer narrating his wanderings, and telling of the cities he had"
357,INTRODUCTION.,visited.
358,INTRODUCTION.,
359,INTRODUCTION.,"At length they retired to rest; but on the following morning, Glaucus"
360,INTRODUCTION.,"resolved to go to his master, and acquaint him with his meeting with"
361,INTRODUCTION.,"Homer. Having left the goats in charge of a fellow-servant, he left"
362,INTRODUCTION.,"Homer at home, promising to return quickly. Having arrived at Bolissus,"
363,INTRODUCTION.,"a place near the farm, and finding his mate, he told him the whole"
364,INTRODUCTION.,story respecting Homer and his journey. He paid little attention to
365,INTRODUCTION.,"what he said, and blamed Glaucus for his stupidity in taking in and"
366,INTRODUCTION.,"feeding maimed and enfeebled persons. However, he bade him bring the"
367,INTRODUCTION.,stranger to him.
368,INTRODUCTION.,
369,INTRODUCTION.,"Glaucus told Homer what had taken place, and bade him follow him,"
370,INTRODUCTION.,assuring him that good fortune would be the result. Conversation soon
371,INTRODUCTION.,showed that the stranger was a man of much cleverness and general
372,INTRODUCTION.,"knowledge, and the Chian persuaded him to remain, and to undertake the"
373,INTRODUCTION.,charge of his children.[11]
374,INTRODUCTION.,
375,INTRODUCTION.,Besides the satisfaction of driving the impostor Thestorides from the
376,INTRODUCTION.,"island, Homer enjoyed considerable success as a teacher. In the town of"
377,INTRODUCTION.,Chios he established a school where he taught the precepts of poetry.
378,INTRODUCTION.,"“To this day,” says Chandler,[12] “the most curious remaining is that"
379,INTRODUCTION.,"which has been named, without reason, the School of Homer. It is on the"
380,INTRODUCTION.,"coast, at some distance from the city, northward, and appears to have"
381,INTRODUCTION.,"been an open temple of Cybele, formed on the top of a rock. The shape"
382,INTRODUCTION.,"is oval, and in the centre is the image of the goddess, the head and an"
383,INTRODUCTION.,"arm wanting. She is represented, as usual, sitting. The chair has a"
384,INTRODUCTION.,"lion carved on each side, and on the back. The area is bounded by a low"
385,INTRODUCTION.,"rim, or seat, and about five yards over. The whole is hewn out of the"
386,INTRODUCTION.,"mountain, is rude, indistinct, and probably of the most remote"
387,INTRODUCTION.,antiquity.”
388,INTRODUCTION.,
389,INTRODUCTION.,"So successful was this school, that Homer realised a considerable"
390,INTRODUCTION.,"fortune. He married, and had two daughters, one of whom died single,"
391,INTRODUCTION.,the other married a Chian.
392,INTRODUCTION.,
393,INTRODUCTION.,The following passage betrays the same tendency to connect the
394,INTRODUCTION.,"personages of the poems with the history of the poet, which has already"
395,INTRODUCTION.,been mentioned:—
396,INTRODUCTION.,
397,INTRODUCTION.,“In his poetical compositions Homer displays great gratitude towards
398,INTRODUCTION.,"Mentor of Ithaca, in the Odyssey, whose name he has inserted in his"

400,INTRODUCTION.,him when afflicted with blindness. He also testifies his gratitude to

402,INTRODUCTION.,
403,INTRODUCTION.,"His celebrity continued to increase, and many persons advised him to"
404,INTRODUCTION.,"visit Greece, whither his reputation had now extended. Having, it is"
405,INTRODUCTION.,"said, made some additions to his poems calculated to please the vanity"
406,INTRODUCTION.,"of the Athenians, of whose city he had hitherto made no mention,[14] he"
407,INTRODUCTION.,"sent out for Samos. Here being recognized by a Samian, who had met with"
408,INTRODUCTION.,"him in Chios, he was handsomely received, and invited to join in"
409,INTRODUCTION.,"celebrating the Apaturian festival. He recited some verses, which gave"
410,INTRODUCTION.,"great satisfaction, and by singing the Eiresione at the New Moon"
411,INTRODUCTION.,"festivals, he earned a subsistence, visiting the houses of the rich,"
412,INTRODUCTION.,with whose children he was very popular.
413,INTRODUCTION.,
414,INTRODUCTION.,"In the spring he sailed for Athens, and arrived at the island of Ios,"
415,INTRODUCTION.,"now Ino, where he fell extremely ill, and died. It is said that his"
416,INTRODUCTION.,"death arose from vexation, at not having been able to unravel an enigma"
417,INTRODUCTION.,proposed by some fishermen’s children.[15]
418,INTRODUCTION.,
419,INTRODUCTION.,"Such is, in brief, the substance of the earliest life of Homer we"
420,INTRODUCTION.,"possess, and so broad are the evidences of its historical"
421,INTRODUCTION.,"worthlessness, that it is scarcely necessary to point them out in"
422,INTRODUCTION.,detail. Let us now consider some of the opinions to which a
423,INTRODUCTION.,"persevering, patient, and learned—but by no means consistent—series of"
424,INTRODUCTION.,"investigations has led. In doing so, I profess to bring forward"
425,INTRODUCTION.,"statements, not to vouch for their reasonableness or probability."
426,INTRODUCTION.,
427,INTRODUCTION.,“Homer appeared. The history of this poet and his works is lost in
428,INTRODUCTION.,"doubtful obscurity, as is the history of many of the first minds who"
429,INTRODUCTION.,"have done honour to humanity, because they rose amidst darkness. The"
430,INTRODUCTION.,"majestic stream of his song, blessing and fertilizing, flows like the"
431,INTRODUCTION.,"Nile, through many lands and nations; and, like the sources of the"
432,INTRODUCTION.,"Nile, its fountains will ever remain concealed.”"
433,INTRODUCTION.,
434,INTRODUCTION.,Such are the words in which one of the most judicious German critics
435,INTRODUCTION.,has eloquently described the uncertainty in which the whole of the
436,INTRODUCTION.,Homeric question is involved. With no less truth and feeling he
437,INTRODUCTION.,proceeds:—
438,INTRODUCTION.,
439,INTRODUCTION.,“It seems here of chief importance to expect no more than the nature of
440,INTRODUCTION.,things makes possible. If the period of tradition in history is the
441,INTRODUCTION.,"region of twilight, we should not expect in it perfect light. The"
442,INTRODUCTION.,"creations of genius always seem like miracles, because they are, for"
443,INTRODUCTION.,"the most part, created far out of the reach of observation. If we were"
444,INTRODUCTION.,"in possession of all the historical testimonies, we never could wholly"
445,INTRODUCTION.,"explain the origin of the Iliad and the Odyssey; for their origin, in"
446,INTRODUCTION.,"all essential points, must have remained the secret of the poet.”[16]"
447,INTRODUCTION.,
448,INTRODUCTION.,"From this criticism, which shows as much insight into the depths of"
449,INTRODUCTION.,human nature as into the minute wire-drawings of scholastic
450,INTRODUCTION.,"investigation, let us pass on to the main question at issue. Was Homer"
451,INTRODUCTION.,an individual?[17] or were the Iliad and Odyssey the result of an
452,INTRODUCTION.,ingenious arrangement of fragments by earlier poets?
453,INTRODUCTION.,
454,INTRODUCTION.,Well has Landor remarked: “Some tell us there were twenty Homers; some
455,INTRODUCTION.,deny that there was ever one. It were idle and foolish to shake the
456,INTRODUCTION.,"contents of a vase, in order to let them settle at last. We are"
457,INTRODUCTION.,"perpetually labouring to destroy our delights, our composure, our"
458,INTRODUCTION.,devotion to superior power. Of all the animals on earth we least know
459,INTRODUCTION.,"what is good for us. My opinion is, that what is best for us is our"
460,INTRODUCTION.,admiration of good. No man living venerates Homer more than I do.”[18]
461,INTRODUCTION.,
462,INTRODUCTION.,"But, greatly as we admire the generous enthusiasm which rests contented"
463,INTRODUCTION.,with the poetry on which its best impulses had been nurtured and
464,INTRODUCTION.,"fostered, without seeking to destroy the vividness of first impressions"
465,INTRODUCTION.,by minute analysis—our editorial office compels us to give some
466,INTRODUCTION.,attention to the doubts and difficulties with which the Homeric
467,INTRODUCTION.,"question is beset, and to entreat our reader, for a brief period, to"
468,INTRODUCTION.,"prefer his judgment to his imagination, and to condescend to dry"
469,INTRODUCTION.,details.
470,INTRODUCTION.,
471,INTRODUCTION.,"Before, however, entering into particulars respecting the question of"
472,INTRODUCTION.,"this unity of the Homeric poems, (at least of the Iliad,) I must"
473,INTRODUCTION.,express my sympathy with the sentiments expressed in the following
474,INTRODUCTION.,remarks:—
475,INTRODUCTION.,
476,INTRODUCTION.,“We cannot but think the universal admiration of its unity by the
477,INTRODUCTION.,"better, the poetic age of Greece, almost conclusive testimony to its"
478,INTRODUCTION.,original composition. It was not till the age of the grammarians that
479,INTRODUCTION.,its primitive integrity was called in question; nor is it injustice to
480,INTRODUCTION.,"assert, that the minute and analytical spirit of a grammarian is not"
481,INTRODUCTION.,"the best qualification for the profound feeling, the comprehensive"
482,INTRODUCTION.,conception of an harmonious whole. The most exquisite anatomist may be
483,INTRODUCTION.,no judge of the symmetry of the human frame: and we would take the
484,INTRODUCTION.,opinion of Chantrey or Westmacott on the proportions and general beauty
485,INTRODUCTION.,"of a form, rather than that of Mr. Brodie or Sir Astley Cooper."
486,INTRODUCTION.,
487,INTRODUCTION.,"“There is some truth, though some malicious exaggeration, in the lines"
488,INTRODUCTION.,of Pope.—
489,INTRODUCTION.,
490,INTRODUCTION.,“‘The critic eye—that microscope of wit
491,INTRODUCTION.,"Sees hairs and pores, examines bit by bit,"
492,INTRODUCTION.,"How parts relate to parts, or they to whole,"
493,INTRODUCTION.,"The body’s harmony, the beaming soul,"
494,INTRODUCTION.,"Are things which Kuster, Burmann, Wasse, shall see,"
495,INTRODUCTION.,When man’s whole frame is obvious to a flea.’”[19]
496,INTRODUCTION.,
497,INTRODUCTION.,
498,INTRODUCTION.,Long was the time which elapsed before any one dreamt of questioning
499,INTRODUCTION.,the unity of the authorship of the Homeric poems. The grave and
500,INTRODUCTION.,"cautious Thucydides quoted without hesitation the Hymn to Apollo,[20]"
501,INTRODUCTION.,the authenticity of which has been already disclaimed by modern
502,INTRODUCTION.,"critics. Longinus, in an oft quoted passage, merely expressed an"
503,INTRODUCTION.,opinion touching the comparative inferiority of the Odyssey to the
504,INTRODUCTION.,"Iliad,[21] and, among a mass of ancient authors, whose very names[22]"
505,INTRODUCTION.,"it would be tedious to detail, no suspicion of the personal"
506,INTRODUCTION.,"non-existence of Homer ever arose. So far, the voice of antiquity seems"
507,INTRODUCTION.,to be in favour of our early ideas on the subject; let us now see what
508,INTRODUCTION.,are the discoveries to which more modern investigations lay claim.
509,INTRODUCTION.,
510,INTRODUCTION.,"At the end of the seventeenth century, doubts had begun to awaken on"
511,INTRODUCTION.,"the subject, and we find Bentley remarking that “Homer wrote a sequel"
512,INTRODUCTION.,"of songs and rhapsodies, to be sung by himself, for small comings and"
513,INTRODUCTION.,"good cheer, at festivals and other days of merriment. These loose songs"
514,INTRODUCTION.,"were not collected together, in the form of an epic poem, till about"
515,INTRODUCTION.,"Peisistratus’ time, about five hundred years after.”[23]"
516,INTRODUCTION.,
517,INTRODUCTION.,Two French writers—Hedelin and Perrault—avowed a similar scepticism on
518,INTRODUCTION.,"the subject; but it is in the “Scienza Nuova” of Battista Vico, that we"
519,INTRODUCTION.,"first meet with the germ of the theory, subsequently defended by Wolf"
520,INTRODUCTION.,"with so much learning and acuteness. Indeed, it is with the Wolfian"
521,INTRODUCTION.,"theory that we have chiefly to deal, and with the following bold"
522,INTRODUCTION.,"hypothesis, which we will detail in the words of Grote:—[24]"
523,INTRODUCTION.,
524,INTRODUCTION.,"“Half a century ago, the acute and valuable Prolegomena of F. A. Wolf,"
525,INTRODUCTION.,"turning to account the Venetian Scholia, which had then been recently"
526,INTRODUCTION.,"published, first opened philosophical discussion as to the history of"
527,INTRODUCTION.,the Homeric text. A considerable part of that dissertation (though by
528,INTRODUCTION.,"no means the whole) is employed in vindicating the position, previously"
529,INTRODUCTION.,"announced by Bentley, amongst others, that the separate constituent"
530,INTRODUCTION.,portions of the Iliad and Odyssey had not been cemented together into
531,INTRODUCTION.,"any compact body and unchangeable order, until the days of"
532,INTRODUCTION.,"Peisistratus, in the sixth century before Christ. As a step towards"
533,INTRODUCTION.,"that conclusion, Wolf maintained that no written copies of either poem"
534,INTRODUCTION.,"could be shown to have existed during the earlier times, to which their"
535,INTRODUCTION.,"composition is referred; and that without writing, neither the perfect"
536,INTRODUCTION.,symmetry of so complicated a work could have been originally conceived
537,INTRODUCTION.,"by any poet, nor, if realized by him, transmitted with assurance to"
538,INTRODUCTION.,"posterity. The absence of easy and convenient writing, such as must be"
539,INTRODUCTION.,"indispensably supposed for long manuscripts, among the early Greeks,"
540,INTRODUCTION.,was thus one of the points in Wolf’s case against the primitive
541,INTRODUCTION.,"integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey. By Nitzsch, and other leading"
542,INTRODUCTION.,"opponents of Wolf, the connection of the one with the other seems to"
543,INTRODUCTION.,have been accepted as he originally put it; and it has been considered
544,INTRODUCTION.,incumbent on those who defended the ancient aggregate character of the
545,INTRODUCTION.,"Iliad and Odyssey, to maintain that they were written poems from the"
546,INTRODUCTION.,beginning.
547,INTRODUCTION.,
548,INTRODUCTION.,"“To me it appears, that the architectonic functions ascribed by Wolf to"
549,INTRODUCTION.,"Peisistratus and his associates, in reference to the Homeric poems, are"
550,INTRODUCTION.,nowise admissible. But much would undoubtedly be gained towards that
551,INTRODUCTION.,"view of the question, if it could be shown, that, in order to"
552,INTRODUCTION.,"controvert it, we were driven to the necessity of admitting long"
553,INTRODUCTION.,"written poems, in the ninth century before the Christian æra. Few"
554,INTRODUCTION.,"things, in my opinion, can be more improbable; and Mr. Payne Knight,"
555,INTRODUCTION.,"opposed as he is to the Wolfian hypothesis, admits this no less than"
556,INTRODUCTION.,"Wolf himself. The traces of writing in Greece, even in the seventh"
557,INTRODUCTION.,"century before the Christian æra, are exceedingly trifling. We have no"
558,INTRODUCTION.,"remaining inscription earlier than the fortieth Olympiad, and the early"
559,INTRODUCTION.,inscriptions are rude and unskilfully executed; nor can we even assure
560,INTRODUCTION.,"ourselves whether Archilochus, Simonidês of Amorgus, Kallinus,"
561,INTRODUCTION.,"Tyrtæus, Xanthus, and the other early elegiac and lyric poets,"
562,INTRODUCTION.,"committed their compositions to writing, or at what time the practice"
563,INTRODUCTION.,of doing so became familiar. The first positive ground which authorizes
564,INTRODUCTION.,"us to presume the existence of a manuscript of Homer, is in the famous"
565,INTRODUCTION.,"ordinance of Solôn, with regard to the rhapsodies at the Panathenæa:"
566,INTRODUCTION.,"but for what length of time previously manuscripts had existed, we are"
567,INTRODUCTION.,unable to say.
568,INTRODUCTION.,
569,INTRODUCTION.,“Those who maintain the Homeric poems to have been written from the
570,INTRODUCTION.,"beginning, rest their case, not upon positive proofs, nor yet upon the"
571,INTRODUCTION.,existing habits of society with regard to poetry—for they admit
572,INTRODUCTION.,"generally that the Iliad and Odyssey were not read, but recited and"
573,INTRODUCTION.,"heard,—but upon the supposed necessity that there must have been"
574,INTRODUCTION.,manuscripts to ensure the preservation of the poems—the unassisted
575,INTRODUCTION.,memory of reciters being neither sufficient nor trustworthy. But here
576,INTRODUCTION.,we only escape a smaller difficulty by running into a greater; for the
577,INTRODUCTION.,"existence of trained bards, gifted with extraordinary memory,[25] is"
578,INTRODUCTION.,"far less astonishing than that of long manuscripts, in an age"
579,INTRODUCTION.,"essentially non-reading and non-writing, and when even suitable"
580,INTRODUCTION.,"instruments and materials for the process are not obvious. Moreover,"
581,INTRODUCTION.,there is a strong positive reason for believing that the bard was under
582,INTRODUCTION.,no necessity of refreshing his memory by consulting a manuscript; for
583,INTRODUCTION.,"if such had been the fact, blindness would have been a disqualification"
584,INTRODUCTION.,"for the profession, which we know that it was not, as well from the"
585,INTRODUCTION.,"example of Demodokus, in the Odyssey, as from that of the blind bard of"
586,INTRODUCTION.,"Chios, in the Hymn to the Delian Apollo, whom Thucydides, as well as"
587,INTRODUCTION.,"the general tenor of Grecian legend, identifies with Homer himself. The"
588,INTRODUCTION.,"author of that hymn, be he who he may, could never have described a"
589,INTRODUCTION.,"blind man as attaining the utmost perfection in his art, if he had been"
590,INTRODUCTION.,conscious that the memory of the bard was only maintained by constant
591,INTRODUCTION.,reference to the manuscript in his chest.”
592,INTRODUCTION.,
593,INTRODUCTION.,"The loss of the digamma, that _crux_ of critics, that quicksand upon"
594,INTRODUCTION.,"which even the acumen of Bentley was shipwrecked, seems to prove beyond"
595,INTRODUCTION.,"a doubt, that the pronunciation of the Greek language had undergone a"
596,INTRODUCTION.,considerable change. Now it is certainly difficult to suppose that the
597,INTRODUCTION.,"Homeric poems could have suffered by this change, had written copies"
598,INTRODUCTION.,"been preserved. If Chaucer’s poetry, for instance, had not been"
599,INTRODUCTION.,"written, it could only have come down to us in a softened form, more"
600,INTRODUCTION.,"like the effeminate version of Dryden, than the rough, quaint, noble"
601,INTRODUCTION.,original.
602,INTRODUCTION.,
603,INTRODUCTION.,"“At what period,” continues Grote, “these poems, or indeed any other"
604,INTRODUCTION.,"Greek poems, first began to be written, must be matter of conjecture,"
605,INTRODUCTION.,though there is ground for assurance that it was before the time of
606,INTRODUCTION.,"Solôn. If, in the absence of evidence, we may venture upon naming any"
607,INTRODUCTION.,"more determinate period, the question at once suggests itself, What"
608,INTRODUCTION.,"were the purposes which, in that state of society, a manuscript at its"
609,INTRODUCTION.,first commencement must have been intended to answer? For whom was a
610,INTRODUCTION.,written Iliad necessary? Not for the rhapsodes; for with them it was
611,INTRODUCTION.,"not only planted in the memory, but also interwoven with the feelings,"
612,INTRODUCTION.,and conceived in conjunction with all those flexions and intonations of
613,INTRODUCTION.,"voice, pauses, and other oral artifices which were required for"
614,INTRODUCTION.,"emphatic delivery, and which the naked manuscript could never"
615,INTRODUCTION.,reproduce. Not for the general public—they were accustomed to receive
616,INTRODUCTION.,"it with its rhapsodic delivery, and with its accompaniments of a solemn"
617,INTRODUCTION.,and crowded festival. The only persons for whom the written Iliad would
618,INTRODUCTION.,be suitable would be a select few; studious and curious men; a class of
619,INTRODUCTION.,readers capable of analyzing the complicated emotions which they had
620,INTRODUCTION.,"experienced as hearers in the crowd, and who would, on perusing the"
621,INTRODUCTION.,"written words, realize in their imaginations a sensible portion of the"
622,INTRODUCTION.,impression communicated by the reciter. Incredible as the statement may
623,INTRODUCTION.,"seem in an age like the present, there is in all early societies, and"
624,INTRODUCTION.,"there was in early Greece, a time when no such reading class existed."
625,INTRODUCTION.,If we could discover at what time such a class first began to be
626,INTRODUCTION.,"formed, we should be able to make a guess at the time when the old epic"
627,INTRODUCTION.,poems were first committed to writing. Now the period which may with
628,INTRODUCTION.,the greatest probability be fixed upon as having first witnessed the
629,INTRODUCTION.,"formation even of the narrowest reading class in Greece, is the middle"
630,INTRODUCTION.,of the seventh century before the Christian æra (B.C. 660 to B.C.
631,INTRODUCTION.,"630), the age of Terpander, Kallinus, Archilochus, Simonidês of"
632,INTRODUCTION.,"Amorgus, &c. I ground this supposition on the change then operated in"
633,INTRODUCTION.,the character and tendencies of Grecian poetry and music—the elegiac
634,INTRODUCTION.,and the iambic measures having been introduced as rivals to the
635,INTRODUCTION.,"primitive hexameter, and poetical compositions having been transferred"
636,INTRODUCTION.,from the epical past to the affairs of present and real life. Such a
637,INTRODUCTION.,change was important at a time when poetry was the only known mode of
638,INTRODUCTION.,"publication (to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable, yet the"
639,INTRODUCTION.,nearest approaching to the sense). It argued a new way of looking at
640,INTRODUCTION.,the old epical treasures of the people as well as a thirst for new
641,INTRODUCTION.,"poetical effect; and the men who stood forward in it, may well be"
642,INTRODUCTION.,"considered as desirous to study, and competent to criticize, from their"
643,INTRODUCTION.,"own individual point of view, the written words of the Homeric"
644,INTRODUCTION.,"rhapsodies, just as we are told that Kallinus both noticed and"
645,INTRODUCTION.,"eulogized the Thebaïs as the production of Homer. There seems,"
646,INTRODUCTION.,"therefore, ground for conjecturing that (for the use of this"
647,INTRODUCTION.,"newly-formed and important, but very narrow class), manuscripts of the"
648,INTRODUCTION.,"Homeric poems and other old epics,—the Thebaïs and the Cypria, as well"
649,INTRODUCTION.,"as the Iliad and the Odyssey,—began to be compiled towards the middle"
650,INTRODUCTION.,of the seventh century (B.C. 1); and the opening of Egypt to Grecian
651,INTRODUCTION.,"commerce, which took place about the same period, would furnish"
652,INTRODUCTION.,increased facilities for obtaining the requisite papyrus to write upon.
653,INTRODUCTION.,"A reading class, when once formed, would doubtless slowly increase, and"
654,INTRODUCTION.,the number of manuscripts along with it; so that before the time of
655,INTRODUCTION.,"Solôn, fifty years afterwards, both readers and manuscripts, though"
656,INTRODUCTION.,"still comparatively few, might have attained a certain recognized"
657,INTRODUCTION.,"authority, and formed a tribunal of reference against the carelessness"
658,INTRODUCTION.,of individual rhapsodes.”[26]
659,INTRODUCTION.,
660,INTRODUCTION.,But even Peisistratus has not been suffered to remain in possession of
661,INTRODUCTION.,"the credit, and we cannot help feeling the force of the following"
662,INTRODUCTION.,observations—
663,INTRODUCTION.,
664,INTRODUCTION.,"“There are several incidental circumstances which, in our opinion,"
665,INTRODUCTION.,throw some suspicion over the whole history of the Peisistratid
666,INTRODUCTION.,"compilation, at least over the theory, that the Iliad was cast into its"
667,INTRODUCTION.,present stately and harmonious form by the directions of the Athenian
668,INTRODUCTION.,"ruler. If the great poets, who flourished at the bright period of"
669,INTRODUCTION.,"Grecian song, of which, alas! we have inherited little more than the"
670,INTRODUCTION.,"fame, and the faint echo, if Stesichorus, Anacreon, and Simonidês were"
671,INTRODUCTION.,"employed in the noble task of compiling the Iliad and Odyssey, so much"
672,INTRODUCTION.,"must have been done to arrange, to connect, to harmonize, that it is"
673,INTRODUCTION.,"almost incredible, that stronger marks of Athenian manufacture should"
674,INTRODUCTION.,"not remain. Whatever occasional anomalies may be detected, anomalies"
675,INTRODUCTION.,which no doubt arise out of our own ignorance of the language of the
676,INTRODUCTION.,"Homeric age, however the irregular use of the digamma may have"
677,INTRODUCTION.,"perplexed our Bentleys, to whom the name of Helen is said to have"
678,INTRODUCTION.,caused as much disquiet and distress as the fair one herself among the
679,INTRODUCTION.,"heroes of her age, however Mr. Knight may have failed in reducing the"
680,INTRODUCTION.,"Homeric language to its primitive form; however, finally, the Attic"
681,INTRODUCTION.,dialect may not have assumed all its more marked and distinguishing
682,INTRODUCTION.,"characteristics—still it is difficult to suppose that the language,"
683,INTRODUCTION.,"particularly in the joinings and transitions, and connecting parts,"
684,INTRODUCTION.,should not more clearly betray the incongruity between the more ancient
685,INTRODUCTION.,and modern forms of expression. It is not quite in character with such
686,INTRODUCTION.,"a period to imitate an antique style, in order to piece out an"
687,INTRODUCTION.,"imperfect poem in the character of the original, as Sir Walter Scott"
688,INTRODUCTION.,has done in his continuation of Sir Tristram.
689,INTRODUCTION.,
690,INTRODUCTION.,"“If, however, not even such faint and indistinct traces of Athenian"
691,INTRODUCTION.,"compilation are discoverable in the language of the poems, the total"
692,INTRODUCTION.,absence of Athenian national feeling is perhaps no less worthy of
693,INTRODUCTION.,"observation. In later, and it may fairly be suspected in earlier times,"
694,INTRODUCTION.,the Athenians were more than ordinarily jealous of the fame of their
695,INTRODUCTION.,"ancestors. But, amid all the traditions of the glories of early Greece"
696,INTRODUCTION.,"embodied in the Iliad, the Athenians play a most subordinate and"
697,INTRODUCTION.,insignificant part. Even the few passages which relate to their
698,INTRODUCTION.,"ancestors, Mr. Knight suspects to be interpolations. It is possible,"
699,INTRODUCTION.,"indeed, that in its leading outline, the Iliad may be true to historic"
700,INTRODUCTION.,"fact, that in the great maritime expedition of western Greece against"
701,INTRODUCTION.,"the rival and half-kindred empire of the Laomedontiadæ, the chieftain"
702,INTRODUCTION.,"of Thessaly, from his valour and the number of his forces, may have"
703,INTRODUCTION.,been the most important ally of the Peloponnesian sovereign; the
704,INTRODUCTION.,preeminent value of the ancient poetry on the Trojan war may thus have
705,INTRODUCTION.,forced the national feeling of the Athenians to yield to their taste.
706,INTRODUCTION.,"The songs which spoke of their own great ancestor were, no doubt, of"
707,INTRODUCTION.,"far inferior sublimity and popularity, or, at first sight, a Theseid"
708,INTRODUCTION.,would have been much more likely to have emanated from an Athenian
709,INTRODUCTION.,"synod of compilers of ancient song, than an Achilleid or an Olysseid."
710,INTRODUCTION.,"Could France have given birth to a Tasso, Tancred would have been the"
711,INTRODUCTION.,"hero of the Jerusalem. If, however, the Homeric ballads, as they are"
712,INTRODUCTION.,"sometimes called, which related the wrath of Achilles, with all its"
713,INTRODUCTION.,"direful consequences, were so far superior to the rest of the poetic"
714,INTRODUCTION.,"cycle, as to admit no rivalry,—it is still surprising, that throughout"
715,INTRODUCTION.,the whole poem the callida junctura should never betray the workmanship
716,INTRODUCTION.,"of an Athenian hand, and that the national spirit of a race, who have"
717,INTRODUCTION.,at a later period not inaptly been compared to our self admiring
718,INTRODUCTION.,"neighbours, the French, should submit with lofty self denial to the"
719,INTRODUCTION.,"almost total exclusion of their own ancestors—or, at least, to the"
720,INTRODUCTION.,questionable dignity of only having produced a leader tolerably skilled
721,INTRODUCTION.,in the military tactics of his age.”[27]
722,INTRODUCTION.,
723,INTRODUCTION.,"To return to the Wolfian theory. While it is to be confessed, that"
724,INTRODUCTION.,Wolf’s objections to the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey
725,INTRODUCTION.,"have never been wholly got over, we cannot help discovering that they"
726,INTRODUCTION.,"have failed to enlighten us as to any substantial point, and that the"
727,INTRODUCTION.,"difficulties with which the whole subject is beset, are rather"
728,INTRODUCTION.,"augmented than otherwise, if we admit his hypothesis. Nor is"
729,INTRODUCTION.,Lachmann’s[28] modification of his theory any better. He divides the
730,INTRODUCTION.,"first twenty-two books of the Iliad into sixteen different songs, and"
731,INTRODUCTION.,treats as ridiculous the belief that their amalgamation into one
732,INTRODUCTION.,regular poem belongs to a period earlier than the age of Peisistratus.
733,INTRODUCTION.,"This, as Grote observes, “explains the gaps and contradictions in the"
734,INTRODUCTION.,"narrative, but it explains nothing else.” Moreover, we find no"
735,INTRODUCTION.,"contradictions warranting this belief, and the so-called sixteen poets"
736,INTRODUCTION.,concur in getting rid of the following leading men in the first battle
737,INTRODUCTION.,"after the secession of Achilles: Elphenor, chief of the Eubœans;"
738,INTRODUCTION.,"Tlepolemus, of the Rhodians; Pandarus, of the Lycians; Odius, of the"
739,INTRODUCTION.,"Halizonians; Pirous and Acamas, of the Thracians. None of these heroes"
740,INTRODUCTION.,"again make their appearance, and we can but agree with Colonel Mure,"
741,INTRODUCTION.,that “it seems strange that any number of independent poets should have
742,INTRODUCTION.,so harmoniously dispensed with the services of all six in the sequel.”
743,INTRODUCTION.,"The discrepancy, by which Pylæmenes, who is represented as dead in the"
744,INTRODUCTION.,"fifth book, weeps at his son’s funeral in the thirteenth, can only be"
745,INTRODUCTION.,regarded as the result of an interpolation.
746,INTRODUCTION.,
747,INTRODUCTION.,"Grote, although not very distinct in stating his own opinions on the"
748,INTRODUCTION.,"subject, has done much to clearly show the incongruity of the Wolfian"
749,INTRODUCTION.,"theory, and of Lachmann’s modifications with the character of"
750,INTRODUCTION.,"Peisistratus. But he has also shown, and we think with equal success,"
751,INTRODUCTION.,"that the two questions relative to the primitive unity of these poems,"
752,INTRODUCTION.,"or, supposing that impossible, the unison of these parts by"
753,INTRODUCTION.,"Peisistratus, and not before his time, are essentially distinct. In"
754,INTRODUCTION.,"short, “a man may believe the Iliad to have been put together out of"
755,INTRODUCTION.,"pre-existing songs, without recognising the age of Peisistratus as the"
756,INTRODUCTION.,period of its first compilation.” The friends or literary _employês_ of
757,INTRODUCTION.,"Peisistratus must have found an Iliad that was already ancient, and the"
758,INTRODUCTION.,silence of the Alexandrine critics respecting the Peisistratic
759,INTRODUCTION.,"“recension,” goes far to prove, that, among the numerous manuscripts"
760,INTRODUCTION.,"they examined, this was either wanting, or thought unworthy of"
761,INTRODUCTION.,attention.
762,INTRODUCTION.,
763,INTRODUCTION.,"“Moreover,” he continues, “the whole tenor of the poems themselves"
764,INTRODUCTION.,"confirms what is here remarked. There is nothing, either in the Iliad"
765,INTRODUCTION.,"or Odyssey, which savours of modernism, applying that term to the age"
766,INTRODUCTION.,of Peisistratus—nothing which brings to our view the alterations
767,INTRODUCTION.,"brought about by two centuries, in the Greek language, the coined"
768,INTRODUCTION.,"money, the habits of writing and reading, the despotisms and republican"
769,INTRODUCTION.,"governments, the close military array, the improved construction of"
770,INTRODUCTION.,"ships, the Amphiktyonic convocations, the mutual frequentation of"
771,INTRODUCTION.,"religious festivals, the Oriental and Egyptian veins of religion, &c.,"
772,INTRODUCTION.,"familiar to the latter epoch. These alterations Onomakritus, and the"
773,INTRODUCTION.,"other literary friends of Peisistratus, could hardly have failed to"
774,INTRODUCTION.,"notice, even without design, had they then, for the first time,"
775,INTRODUCTION.,undertaken the task of piecing together many self existent epics into
776,INTRODUCTION.,"one large aggregate. Everything in the two great Homeric poems, both in"
777,INTRODUCTION.,"substance and in language, belongs to an age two or three centuries"
778,INTRODUCTION.,"earlier than Peisistratus. Indeed, even the interpolations (or those"
779,INTRODUCTION.,"passages which, on the best grounds, are pronounced to be such) betray"
780,INTRODUCTION.,"no trace of the sixth century before Christ, and may well have been"
781,INTRODUCTION.,heard by Archilochus and Kallinus—in some cases even by Arktinus and
782,INTRODUCTION.,Hesiod—as genuine Homeric matter.[29] As far as the evidences on the
783,INTRODUCTION.,"case, as well internal as external, enable us to judge, we seem"
784,INTRODUCTION.,warranted in believing that the Iliad and Odyssey were recited
785,INTRODUCTION.,substantially as they now stand (always allowing for partial
786,INTRODUCTION.,"divergences of text and interpolations) in 776 B.C., our first"
787,INTRODUCTION.,"trustworthy mark of Grecian time; and this ancient date, let it be"
788,INTRODUCTION.,"added, as it is the best-authenticated fact, so it is also the most"
789,INTRODUCTION.,"important attribute of the Homeric poems, considered in reference to"
790,INTRODUCTION.,Grecian history; for they thus afford us an insight into the
791,INTRODUCTION.,"anti-historical character of the Greeks, enabling us to trace the"
792,INTRODUCTION.,"subsequent forward march of the nation, and to seize instructive"
793,INTRODUCTION.,contrasts between their former and their later condition.”[30]
794,INTRODUCTION.,
795,INTRODUCTION.,"On the whole, I am inclined to believe, that the labours of"
796,INTRODUCTION.,"Peisistratus were wholly of an editorial character, although, I must"
797,INTRODUCTION.,"confess, that I can lay down nothing respecting the extent of his"
798,INTRODUCTION.,"labours. At the same time, so far from believing that the composition"
799,INTRODUCTION.,"or primary arrangement of these poems, in their present form, was the"
800,INTRODUCTION.,"work of Peisistratus, I am rather persuaded that the fine taste and"
801,INTRODUCTION.,elegant mind of that Athenian[31] would lead him to preserve an ancient
802,INTRODUCTION.,"and traditional order of the poems, rather than to patch and"
803,INTRODUCTION.,re-construct them according to a fanciful hypothesis. I will not repeat
804,INTRODUCTION.,"the many discussions respecting whether the poems were written or not,"
805,INTRODUCTION.,or whether the art of writing was known in the time of their reputed
806,INTRODUCTION.,"author. Suffice it to say, that the more we read, the less satisfied we"
807,INTRODUCTION.,are upon either subject.
808,INTRODUCTION.,
809,INTRODUCTION.,"I cannot, however, help thinking, that the story which attributes the"
810,INTRODUCTION.,"preservation of these poems to Lycurgus, is little else than a version"
811,INTRODUCTION.,"of the same story as that of Peisistratus, while its historical"
812,INTRODUCTION.,probability must be measured by that of many others relating to the
813,INTRODUCTION.,Spartan Confucius.
814,INTRODUCTION.,
815,INTRODUCTION.,"I will conclude this sketch of the Homeric theories, with an attempt,"
816,INTRODUCTION.,"made by an ingenious friend, to unite them into something like"
817,INTRODUCTION.,consistency. It is as follows:—
818,INTRODUCTION.,
819,INTRODUCTION.,"“No doubt the common soldiers of that age had, like the common sailors"
820,INTRODUCTION.,"of some fifty years ago, some one qualified to ‘discourse in excellent"
821,INTRODUCTION.,"music’ among them. Many of these, like those of the negroes in the"
822,INTRODUCTION.,"United States, were extemporaneous, and allusive to events passing"
823,INTRODUCTION.,around them. But what was passing around them? The grand events of a
824,INTRODUCTION.,"spirit-stirring war; occurrences likely to impress themselves, as the"
825,INTRODUCTION.,"mystical legends of former times had done, upon their memory; besides"
826,INTRODUCTION.,"which, a retentive memory was deemed a virtue of the first water, and"
827,INTRODUCTION.,"was cultivated accordingly in those ancient times. Ballads at first,"
828,INTRODUCTION.,"and down to the beginning of the war with Troy, were merely"
829,INTRODUCTION.,"recitations, with an intonation. Then followed a species of recitative,"
830,INTRODUCTION.,"probably with an intoned burden. Tune next followed, as it aided the"
831,INTRODUCTION.,memory considerably.
832,INTRODUCTION.,
833,INTRODUCTION.,"“It was at this period, about four hundred years after the war, that a"
834,INTRODUCTION.,"poet flourished of the name of Melesigenes, or Mœonides, but most"
835,INTRODUCTION.,probably the former. He saw that these ballads might be made of great
836,INTRODUCTION.,utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the social position of
837,INTRODUCTION.,"Hellas, and, as a collection, he published these lays, connecting them"
838,INTRODUCTION.,"by a tale of his own. This poem now exists, under the title of the"
839,INTRODUCTION.,"‘Odyssea.’ The author, however, did not affix his own name to the poem,"
840,INTRODUCTION.,"which, in fact, was, great part of it, remodelled from the archaic"
841,INTRODUCTION.,"dialect of Crete, in which tongue the ballads were found by him. He"
842,INTRODUCTION.,"therefore called it the poem of Homeros, or the Collector; but this is"
843,INTRODUCTION.,"rather a proof of his modesty and talent, than of his mere drudging"
844,INTRODUCTION.,"arrangement of other people’s ideas; for, as Grote has finely observed,"
845,INTRODUCTION.,"arguing for the unity of authorship, ‘a great poet might have re-cast"
846,INTRODUCTION.,pre-existing separate songs into one comprehensive whole; but no mere
847,INTRODUCTION.,arrangers or compilers would be competent to do so.’
848,INTRODUCTION.,
849,INTRODUCTION.,"“While employed on the wild legend of Odysseus, he met with a ballad,"
850,INTRODUCTION.,recording the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon. His noble mind seized
851,INTRODUCTION.,"the hint that there presented itself, and the Achilleïs[32] grew under"
852,INTRODUCTION.,"his hand. Unity of design, however, caused him to publish the poem"
853,INTRODUCTION.,under the same pseudonyme as his former work: and the disjointed lays
854,INTRODUCTION.,"of the ancient bards were joined together, like those relating to the"
855,INTRODUCTION.,"Cid, into a chronicle history, named the Iliad. Melesigenes knew that"
856,INTRODUCTION.,"the poem was destined to be a lasting one, and so it has proved; but,"
857,INTRODUCTION.,"first, the poems were destined to undergo many vicissitudes and"
858,INTRODUCTION.,"corruptions, by the people who took to singing them in the streets,"
859,INTRODUCTION.,"assemblies, and agoras. However, Solôn first, and then Peisistratus,"
860,INTRODUCTION.,"and afterwards Aristoteles and others, revised the poems, and restored"
861,INTRODUCTION.,the works of Melesigenes Homeros to their original integrity in a great
862,INTRODUCTION.,measure.”[33]
863,INTRODUCTION.,
864,INTRODUCTION.,Having thus given some general notion of the strange theories which
865,INTRODUCTION.,"have developed themselves respecting this most interesting subject, I"
866,INTRODUCTION.,must still express my conviction as to the unity of the authorship of
867,INTRODUCTION.,the Homeric poems. To deny that many corruptions and interpolations
868,INTRODUCTION.,"disfigure them, and that the intrusive hand of the poetasters may here"
869,INTRODUCTION.,and there have inflicted a wound more serious than the negligence of
870,INTRODUCTION.,"the copyist, would be an absurd and captious assumption, but it is to a"
871,INTRODUCTION.,"higher criticism that we must appeal, if we would either understand or"
872,INTRODUCTION.,enjoy these poems. In maintaining the authenticity and personality of
873,INTRODUCTION.,"their one author, be he Homer or Melesigenes, _quocunque nomine vocari"
874,INTRODUCTION.,"eum jus fasque sit_, I feel conscious that, while the whole weight of"
875,INTRODUCTION.,historical evidence is against the hypothesis which would assign these
876,INTRODUCTION.,"great works to a plurality of authors, the most powerful internal"
877,INTRODUCTION.,"evidence, and that which springs from the deepest and most immediate"
878,INTRODUCTION.,"impulse of the soul, also speaks eloquently to the contrary."
879,INTRODUCTION.,
880,INTRODUCTION.,The minutiæ of verbal criticism I am far from seeking to despise.
881,INTRODUCTION.,"Indeed, considering the character of some of my own books, such an"
882,INTRODUCTION.,"attempt would be gross inconsistency. But, while I appreciate its"
883,INTRODUCTION.,"importance in a philological view, I am inclined to set little store on"
884,INTRODUCTION.,"its æsthetic value, especially in poetry. Three parts of the"
885,INTRODUCTION.,"emendations made upon poets are mere alterations, some of which, had"
886,INTRODUCTION.,"they been suggested to the author by his Mæcenas or Africanus, he"
887,INTRODUCTION.,"would probably have adopted. Moreover, those who are most exact in"
888,INTRODUCTION.,"laying down rules of verbal criticism and interpretation, are often"
889,INTRODUCTION.,least competent to carry out their own precepts. Grammarians are not
890,INTRODUCTION.,"poets by profession, but may be so _per accidens_. I do not at this"
891,INTRODUCTION.,"moment remember two emendations on Homer, calculated to substantially"
892,INTRODUCTION.,"improve the poetry of a passage, although a mass of remarks, from"
893,INTRODUCTION.,"Herodotus down to Loewe, have given us the history of a thousand minute"
894,INTRODUCTION.,"points, without which our Greek knowledge would be gloomy and jejune."
895,INTRODUCTION.,
896,INTRODUCTION.,"But it is not on words only that grammarians, mere grammarians, will"
897,INTRODUCTION.,exercise their elaborate and often tiresome ingenuity. Binding down an
898,INTRODUCTION.,heroic or dramatic poet to the block upon which they have previously
899,INTRODUCTION.,"dissected his words and sentences, they proceed to use the axe and the"
900,INTRODUCTION.,"pruning knife by wholesale, and inconsistent in everything but their"
901,INTRODUCTION.,"wish to make out a case of unlawful affiliation, they cut out book"
902,INTRODUCTION.,"after book, passage after passage, till the author is reduced to a"
903,INTRODUCTION.,"collection of fragments, or till those, who fancied they possessed the"
904,INTRODUCTION.,"works of some great man, find that they have been put off with a vile"
905,INTRODUCTION.,counterfeit got up at second hand. If we compare the theories of
906,INTRODUCTION.,"Knight, Wolf, Lachmann, and others, we shall feel better satisfied of"
907,INTRODUCTION.,the utter uncertainty of criticism than of the apocryphal position of
908,INTRODUCTION.,Homer. One rejects what another considers the turning-point of his
909,INTRODUCTION.,theory. One cuts a supposed knot by expunging what another would
910,INTRODUCTION.,explain by omitting something else.
911,INTRODUCTION.,
912,INTRODUCTION.,Nor is this morbid species of sagacity by any means to be looked upon
913,INTRODUCTION.,"as a literary novelty. Justus Lipsius, a scholar of no ordinary skill,"
914,INTRODUCTION.,"seems to revel in the imaginary discovery, that the tragedies"
915,INTRODUCTION.,"attributed to Seneca are by _four_ different authors.[34] Now, I will"
916,INTRODUCTION.,"venture to assert, that these tragedies are so uniform, not only in"
917,INTRODUCTION.,their borrowed phraseology—a phraseology with which writers like
918,INTRODUCTION.,Boethius and Saxo Grammaticus were more charmed than ourselves—in their
919,INTRODUCTION.,"freedom from real poetry, and last, but not least, in an ultra-refined"
920,INTRODUCTION.,"and consistent abandonment of good taste, that few writers of the"
921,INTRODUCTION.,"present day would question the capabilities of the same gentleman, be"
922,INTRODUCTION.,"he Seneca or not, to produce not only these, but a great many more"
923,INTRODUCTION.,"equally bad. With equal sagacity, Father Hardouin astonished the world"
924,INTRODUCTION.,"with the startling announcement that the Æneid of Virgil, and the"
925,INTRODUCTION.,"satires of Horace, were literary deceptions. Now, without wishing to"
926,INTRODUCTION.,"say one word of disrespect against the industry and learning—nay, the"
927,INTRODUCTION.,"refined acuteness—which scholars, like Wolf, have bestowed upon this"
928,INTRODUCTION.,"subject, I must express my fears, that many of our modern Homeric"
929,INTRODUCTION.,"theories will become matter for the surprise and entertainment, rather"
930,INTRODUCTION.,"than the instruction, of posterity. Nor can I help thinking, that the"
931,INTRODUCTION.,literary history of more recent times will account for many points of
932,INTRODUCTION.,difficulty in the transmission of the Iliad and Odyssey to a period so
933,INTRODUCTION.,remote from that of their first creation.
934,INTRODUCTION.,
935,INTRODUCTION.,I have already expressed my belief that the labours of Peisistratus
936,INTRODUCTION.,were of a purely editorial character; and there seems no more reason
937,INTRODUCTION.,why corrupt and imperfect editions of Homer may not have been abroad in
938,INTRODUCTION.,"his day, than that the poems of Valerius Flaccus and Tibullus should"
939,INTRODUCTION.,"have given so much trouble to Poggio, Scaliger, and others. But, after"
940,INTRODUCTION.,"all, the main fault in all the Homeric theories is, that they demand"
941,INTRODUCTION.,too great a sacrifice of those feelings to which poetry most powerfully
942,INTRODUCTION.,"appeals, and which are its most fitting judges. The ingenuity which has"
943,INTRODUCTION.,"sought to rob us of the name and existence of Homer, does too much"
944,INTRODUCTION.,"violence to that inward emotion, which makes our whole soul yearn with"
945,INTRODUCTION.,love and admiration for the blind bard of Chios. To believe the author
946,INTRODUCTION.,"of the Iliad a mere compiler, is to degrade the powers of human"
947,INTRODUCTION.,invention; to elevate analytical judgment at the expense of the most
948,INTRODUCTION.,ennobling impulses of the soul; and to forget the ocean in the
949,INTRODUCTION.,"contemplation of a polypus. There is a catholicity, so to speak, in the"
950,INTRODUCTION.,very name of Homer. Our faith in the author of the Iliad may be a
951,INTRODUCTION.,"mistaken one, but as yet nobody has taught us a better."
952,INTRODUCTION.,
953,INTRODUCTION.,"While, however, I look upon the belief in Homer as one that has nature"
954,INTRODUCTION.,herself for its mainspring; while I can join with old Ennius in
955,INTRODUCTION.,"believing in Homer as the ghost, who, like some patron saint, hovers"
956,INTRODUCTION.,"round the bed of the poet, and even bestows rare gifts from that wealth"
957,INTRODUCTION.,"of imagination which a host of imitators could not exhaust,—still I am"
958,INTRODUCTION.,far from wishing to deny that the author of these great poems found a
959,INTRODUCTION.,"rich fund of tradition, a well-stocked mythical storehouse from whence"
960,INTRODUCTION.,he might derive both subject and embellishment. But it is one thing to
961,INTRODUCTION.,"_use_ existing romances in the embellishment of a poem, another to"
962,INTRODUCTION.,patch up the poem itself from such materials. What consistency of style
963,INTRODUCTION.,"and execution can be hoped for from such an attempt? or, rather, what"
964,INTRODUCTION.,bad taste and tedium will not be the infallible result?
965,INTRODUCTION.,
966,INTRODUCTION.,"A blending of popular legends, and a free use of the songs of other"
967,INTRODUCTION.,"bards, are features perfectly consistent with poetical originality. In"
968,INTRODUCTION.,"fact, the most original writer is still drawing upon outward"
969,INTRODUCTION.,"impressions—nay, even his own thoughts are a kind of secondary agents"
970,INTRODUCTION.,which support and feed the impulses of imagination. But unless there be
971,INTRODUCTION.,"some grand pervading principle—some invisible, yet most distinctly"
972,INTRODUCTION.,"stamped archetypus of the great whole, a poem like the Iliad can never"
973,INTRODUCTION.,"come to the birth. Traditions the most picturesque, episodes the most"
974,INTRODUCTION.,"pathetic, local associations teeming with the thoughts of gods and"
975,INTRODUCTION.,"great men, may crowd in one mighty vision, or reveal themselves in more"
976,INTRODUCTION.,"substantial forms to the mind of the poet; but, except the power to"
977,INTRODUCTION.,"create a grand whole, to which these shall be but as details and"
978,INTRODUCTION.,"embellishments, be present, we shall have nought but a scrap-book, a"
979,INTRODUCTION.,parterre filled with flowers and weeds strangling each other in their
980,INTRODUCTION.,"wild redundancy: we shall have a cento of rags and tatters, which will"
981,INTRODUCTION.,require little acuteness to detect.
982,INTRODUCTION.,
983,INTRODUCTION.,"Sensible as I am of the difficulty of disproving a negative, and aware"
984,INTRODUCTION.,"as I must be of the weighty grounds there are for opposing my belief,"
985,INTRODUCTION.,it still seems to me that the Homeric question is one that is reserved
986,INTRODUCTION.,for a higher criticism than it has often obtained. We are not by nature
987,INTRODUCTION.,"intended to know all things; still less, to compass the powers by which"
988,INTRODUCTION.,the greatest blessings of life have been placed at our disposal. Were
989,INTRODUCTION.,"faith no virtue, then we might indeed wonder why God willed our"
990,INTRODUCTION.,ignorance on any matter. But we are too well taught the contrary
991,INTRODUCTION.,lesson; and it seems as though our faith should be especially tried
992,INTRODUCTION.,touching the men and the events which have wrought most influence upon
993,INTRODUCTION.,the condition of humanity. And there is a kind of sacredness attached
994,INTRODUCTION.,"to the memory of the great and the good, which seems to bid us repulse"
995,INTRODUCTION.,the scepticism which would allegorize their existence into a pleasing
996,INTRODUCTION.,"apologue, and measure the giants of intellect by an homeopathic"
997,INTRODUCTION.,dynameter.
998,INTRODUCTION.,
999,INTRODUCTION.,Long and habitual reading of Homer appears to familiarize our thoughts
1000,INTRODUCTION.,"even to his incongruities; or rather, if we read in a right spirit and"
1001,INTRODUCTION.,"with a heartfelt appreciation, we are too much dazzled, too deeply"
1002,INTRODUCTION.,"wrapped in admiration of the whole, to dwell upon the minute spots"
1003,INTRODUCTION.,which mere analysis can discover. In reading an heroic poem we must
1004,INTRODUCTION.,"transform ourselves into heroes of the time being, we in imagination"
1005,INTRODUCTION.,"must fight over the same battles, woo the same loves, burn with the"
1006,INTRODUCTION.,"same sense of injury, as an Achilles or a Hector. And if we can but"
1007,INTRODUCTION.,attain this degree of enthusiasm (and less enthusiasm will scarcely
1008,INTRODUCTION.,"suffice for the reading of Homer), we shall feel that the poems of"
1009,INTRODUCTION.,"Homer are not only the work of one writer, but of the greatest writer"
1010,INTRODUCTION.,that ever touched the hearts of men by the power of song.
1011,INTRODUCTION.,
1012,INTRODUCTION.,And it was this supposed unity of authorship which gave these poems
1013,INTRODUCTION.,"their powerful influence over the minds of the men of old. Heeren, who"
1014,INTRODUCTION.,"is evidently little disposed in favour of modern theories, finely"
1015,INTRODUCTION.,observes:—
1016,INTRODUCTION.,
1017,INTRODUCTION.,“It was Homer who formed the character of the Greek nation. No poet has
1018,INTRODUCTION.,"ever, as a poet, exercised a similar influence over his countrymen."
1019,INTRODUCTION.,"Prophets, lawgivers, and sages have formed the character of other"
1020,INTRODUCTION.,nations; it was reserved to a poet to form that of the Greeks. This is
1021,INTRODUCTION.,a feature in their character which was not wholly erased even in the
1022,INTRODUCTION.,period of their degeneracy. When lawgivers and sages appeared in
1023,INTRODUCTION.,"Greece, the work of the poet had already been accomplished; and they"
1024,INTRODUCTION.,paid homage to his superior genius. He held up before his nation the
1025,INTRODUCTION.,"mirror, in which they were to behold the world of gods and heroes no"
1026,INTRODUCTION.,"less than of feeble mortals, and to behold them reflected with purity"
1027,INTRODUCTION.,and truth. His poems are founded on the first feeling of human nature;
1028,INTRODUCTION.,"on the love of children, wife, and country; on that passion which"
1029,INTRODUCTION.,"outweighs all others, the love of glory. His songs were poured forth"
1030,INTRODUCTION.,from a breast which sympathized with all the feelings of man; and
1031,INTRODUCTION.,"therefore they enter, and will continue to enter, every breast which"
1032,INTRODUCTION.,"cherishes the same sympathies. If it is granted to his immortal spirit,"
1033,INTRODUCTION.,"from another heaven than any of which he dreamed on earth, to look down"
1034,INTRODUCTION.,"on his race, to see the nations from the fields of Asia to the forests"
1035,INTRODUCTION.,"of Hercynia, performing pilgrimages to the fountain which his magic"
1036,INTRODUCTION.,wand caused to flow; if it is permitted to him to view the vast
1037,INTRODUCTION.,"assemblage of grand, of elevated, of glorious productions, which had"
1038,INTRODUCTION.,been called into being by means of his songs; wherever his immortal
1039,INTRODUCTION.,"spirit may reside, this alone would suffice to complete his"
1040,INTRODUCTION.,happiness.”[35]
1041,INTRODUCTION.,
1042,INTRODUCTION.,"Can we contemplate that ancient monument, on which the “Apotheosis of"
1043,INTRODUCTION.,"Homer”[36] is depictured, and not feel how much of pleasing"
1044,INTRODUCTION.,"association, how much that appeals most forcibly and most distinctly to"
1045,INTRODUCTION.,"our minds, is lost by the admittance of any theory but our old"
1046,INTRODUCTION.,"tradition? The more we read, and the more we think—think as becomes the"
1047,INTRODUCTION.,"readers of Homer,—the more rooted becomes the conviction that the"
1048,INTRODUCTION.,"Father of Poetry gave us this rich inheritance, whole and entire."
1049,INTRODUCTION.,"Whatever were the means of its preservation, let us rather be thankful"
1050,INTRODUCTION.,"for the treasury of taste and eloquence thus laid open to our use, than"
1051,INTRODUCTION.,seek to make it a mere centre around which to drive a series of
1052,INTRODUCTION.,"theories, whose wildness is only equalled by their inconsistency with"
1053,INTRODUCTION.,each other.
1054,INTRODUCTION.,
1055,INTRODUCTION.,"As the hymns, and some other poems usually ascribed to Homer, are not"
1056,INTRODUCTION.,"included in Pope’s translation, I will content myself with a brief"
1057,INTRODUCTION.,"account of the Battle of the Frogs and Mice, from the pen of a writer"
1058,INTRODUCTION.,who has done it full justice[37]:—
1059,INTRODUCTION.,
1060,INTRODUCTION.,"“This poem,” says Coleridge, “is a short mock-heroic of ancient date."
1061,INTRODUCTION.,"The text varies in different editions, and is obviously disturbed and"
1062,INTRODUCTION.,corrupt to a great degree; it is commonly said to have been a juvenile
1063,INTRODUCTION.,"essay of Homer’s genius; others have attributed it to the same Pigrees,"
1064,INTRODUCTION.,"mentioned above, and whose reputation for humour seems to have invited"
1065,INTRODUCTION.,"the appropriation of any piece of ancient wit, the author of which was"
1066,INTRODUCTION.,"uncertain; so little did the Greeks, before the age of the Ptolemies,"
1067,INTRODUCTION.,know or care about that department of criticism employed in determining
1068,INTRODUCTION.,the genuineness of ancient writings. As to this little poem being a
1069,INTRODUCTION.,"youthful profusion of Homer, it seems sufficient to say that from the"
1070,INTRODUCTION.,"beginning to the end it is a plain and palpable parody, not only of the"
1071,INTRODUCTION.,"general spirit, but of the numerous passages of the Iliad itself; and"
1072,INTRODUCTION.,"even, if no such intention to parody were discernible in it, the"
1073,INTRODUCTION.,"objection would still remain, that to suppose a work of mere burlesque"
1074,INTRODUCTION.,"to be the primary effort of poetry in a simple age, seems to reverse"
1075,INTRODUCTION.,"that order in the development of national taste, which the history of"
1076,INTRODUCTION.,"every other people in Europe, and of many in Asia, has almost"
1077,INTRODUCTION.,ascertained to be a law of the human mind; it is in a state of society
1078,INTRODUCTION.,"much more refined and permanent than that described in the Iliad, that"
1079,INTRODUCTION.,any popularity would attend such a ridicule of war and the gods as is
1080,INTRODUCTION.,contained in this poem; and the fact of there having existed three
1081,INTRODUCTION.,"other poems of the same kind attributed, for aught we can see, with as"
1082,INTRODUCTION.,"much reason to Homer, is a strong inducement to believe that none of"
1083,INTRODUCTION.,them were of the Homeric age. Knight infers from the usage of the word
1084,INTRODUCTION.,"deltos, “writing tablet,” instead of διφθέρα, “skin,” which, according"
1085,INTRODUCTION.,"to Herod. 5, 58, was the material employed by the Asiatic Greeks for"
1086,INTRODUCTION.,"that purpose, that this poem was another offspring of Attic ingenuity;"
1087,INTRODUCTION.,and generally that the familiar mention of the cock (v. 191) is a
1088,INTRODUCTION.,strong argument against so ancient a date for its composition.”
1089,INTRODUCTION.,
1090,INTRODUCTION.,Having thus given a brief account of the poems comprised in Pope’s
1091,INTRODUCTION.,"design, I will now proceed to make a few remarks on his translation,"
1092,INTRODUCTION.,and on my own purpose in the present edition.
1093,INTRODUCTION.,
1094,INTRODUCTION.,"Pope was not a Grecian. His whole education had been irregular, and his"
1095,INTRODUCTION.,earliest acquaintance with the poet was through the version of Ogilby.
1096,INTRODUCTION.,It is not too much to say that his whole work bears the impress of a
1097,INTRODUCTION.,"disposition to be satisfied with the general sense, rather than to dive"
1098,INTRODUCTION.,deeply into the minute and delicate features of language. Hence his
1099,INTRODUCTION.,whole work is to be looked upon rather as an elegant paraphrase than a
1100,INTRODUCTION.,"translation. There are, to be sure, certain conventional anecdotes,"
1101,INTRODUCTION.,"which prove that Pope consulted various friends, whose classical"
1102,INTRODUCTION.,"attainments were sounder than his own, during the undertaking; but it"
1103,INTRODUCTION.,is probable that these examinations were the result rather of the
1104,INTRODUCTION.,"contradictory versions already existing, than of a desire to make a"
1105,INTRODUCTION.,"perfect transcript of the original. And in those days, what is called"
1106,INTRODUCTION.,literal translation was less cultivated than at present. If something
1107,INTRODUCTION.,like the general sense could be decorated with the easy gracefulness of
1108,INTRODUCTION.,a practised poet; if the charms of metrical cadence and a pleasing
1109,INTRODUCTION.,fluency could be made consistent with a fair interpretation of the
1110,INTRODUCTION.,"poet’s meaning, his _words_ were less jealously sought for, and those"
1111,INTRODUCTION.,who could read so good a poem as Pope’s Iliad had fair reason to be
1112,INTRODUCTION.,satisfied.
1113,INTRODUCTION.,
1114,INTRODUCTION.,"It would be absurd, therefore, to test Pope’s translation by our own"
1115,INTRODUCTION.,advancing knowledge of the original text. We must be content to look at
1116,INTRODUCTION.,"it as a most delightful work in itself,—a work which is as much a part"
1117,INTRODUCTION.,of English literature as Homer himself is of Greek. We must not be torn
1118,INTRODUCTION.,"from our kindly associations with the old Iliad, that once was our most"
1119,INTRODUCTION.,"cherished companion, or our most looked-for prize, merely because"
1120,INTRODUCTION.,"Buttmann, Loewe, and Liddell have made us so much more accurate as to"
1121,INTRODUCTION.,"ἀμφικύπελλον being an adjective, and not a substantive. Far be it from"
1122,INTRODUCTION.,"us to defend the faults of Pope, especially when we think of Chapman’s"
1123,INTRODUCTION.,"fine, bold, rough old English;—far be it from us to hold up his"
1124,INTRODUCTION.,translation as what a translation of Homer _might_ be. But we can still
1125,INTRODUCTION.,"dismiss Pope’s Iliad to the hands of our readers, with the"
1126,INTRODUCTION.,consciousness that they must have read a very great number of books
1127,INTRODUCTION.,before they have read its fellow.
1128,INTRODUCTION.,
1129,INTRODUCTION.,"As to the Notes accompanying the present volume, they are drawn up"
1130,INTRODUCTION.,"without pretension, and mainly with the view of helping the general"
1131,INTRODUCTION.,reader. Having some little time since translated all the works of Homer
1132,INTRODUCTION.,"for another publisher, I might have brought a large amount of"
1133,INTRODUCTION.,"accumulated matter, sometimes of a critical character, to bear upon the"
1134,INTRODUCTION.,text. But Pope’s version was no field for such a display; and my
1135,INTRODUCTION.,"purpose was to touch briefly on antiquarian or mythological allusions,"
1136,INTRODUCTION.,"to notice occasionally _some_ departures from the original, and to give"
1137,INTRODUCTION.,"a few parallel passages from our English Homer, Milton. In the latter"
1138,INTRODUCTION.,"task I cannot pretend to novelty, but I trust that my other"
1139,INTRODUCTION.,"annotations, while utterly disclaiming high scholastic views, will be"
1140,INTRODUCTION.,"found to convey as much as is wanted; at least, as far as the necessary"
1141,INTRODUCTION.,limits of these volumes could be expected to admit. To write a
1142,INTRODUCTION.,commentary on Homer is not my present aim; but if I have made Pope’s
1143,INTRODUCTION.,translation a little more entertaining and instructive to a mass of
1144,INTRODUCTION.,"miscellaneous readers, I shall consider my wishes satisfactorily"
1145,INTRODUCTION.,accomplished.

1157,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1158,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,Homer is universally allowed to have had the greatest invention of any
1159,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,writer whatever. The praise of judgment Virgil has justly contested
1160,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"with him, and others may have their pretensions as to particular"
1161,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,excellences; but his invention remains yet unrivalled. Nor is it a
1162,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"wonder if he has ever been acknowledged the greatest of poets, who most"
1163,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,excelled in that which is the very foundation of poetry. It is the
1164,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"invention that, in different degrees, distinguishes all great geniuses:"
1165,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"the utmost stretch of human study, learning, and industry, which"
1166,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"masters everything besides, can never attain to this. It furnishes art"
1167,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"with all her materials, and without it judgment itself can at best but"
1168,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,“steal wisely:” for art is only like a prudent steward that lives on
1169,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,managing the riches of nature. Whatever praises may be given to works
1170,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"of judgment, there is not even a single beauty in them to which the"
1171,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"invention must not contribute: as in the most regular gardens, art can"
1172,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"only reduce beauties of nature to more regularity, and such a figure,"
1173,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"which the common eye may better take in, and is, therefore, more"
1174,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"entertained with. And, perhaps, the reason why common critics are"
1175,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,inclined to prefer a judicious and methodical genius to a great and
1176,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"fruitful one, is, because they find it easier for themselves to pursue"
1177,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"their observations through a uniform and bounded walk of art, than to"
1178,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,comprehend the vast and various extent of nature.
1179,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1180,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Our author’s work is a wild paradise, where, if we cannot see all the"
1181,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"beauties so distinctly as in an ordered garden, it is only because the"
1182,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"number of them is infinitely greater. It is like a copious nursery,"
1183,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"which contains the seeds and first productions of every kind, out of"
1184,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"which those who followed him have but selected some particular plants,"
1185,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"each according to his fancy, to cultivate and beautify. If some things"
1186,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,are too luxuriant it is owing to the richness of the soil; and if
1187,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"others are not arrived to perfection or maturity, it is only because"
1188,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,they are overrun and oppressed by those of a stronger nature.
1189,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1190,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,It is to the strength of this amazing invention we are to attribute
1191,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"that unequalled fire and rapture which is so forcible in Homer, that no"
1192,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,man of a true poetical spirit is master of himself while he reads him.
1193,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,What he writes is of the most animated nature imaginable; every thing
1194,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"moves, every thing lives, and is put in action. If a council be called,"
1195,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"or a battle fought, you are not coldly informed of what was said or"
1196,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,done as from a third person; the reader is hurried out of himself by
1197,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"the force of the poet’s imagination, and turns in one place to a"
1198,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"hearer, in another to a spectator. The course of his verses resembles"
1199,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"that of the army he describes,"
1200,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1201,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Οἵδ’ ἄῤ ἴσαν, ὡσεί τε πυρὶ χθὼν πἆσα νέμοιτο."
1202,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1203,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,“They pour along like a fire that sweeps the whole earth before it.” It
1204,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"is, however, remarkable, that his fancy, which is everywhere vigorous,"
1205,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,is not discovered immediately at the beginning of his poem in its
1206,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,fullest splendour: it grows in the progress both upon himself and
1207,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"others, and becomes on fire, like a chariot-wheel, by its own rapidity."
1208,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Exact disposition, just thought, correct elocution, polished numbers,"
1209,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"may have been found in a thousand; but this poetic fire, this “vivida"
1210,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"vis animi,” in a very few. Even in works where all those are imperfect"
1211,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"or neglected, this can overpower criticism, and make us admire even"
1212,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"while we disapprove. Nay, where this appears, though attended with"
1213,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"absurdities, it brightens all the rubbish about it, till we see nothing"
1214,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"but its own splendour. This fire is discerned in Virgil, but discerned"
1215,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"as through a glass, reflected from Homer, more shining than fierce, but"
1216,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,everywhere equal and constant: in Lucan and Statius it bursts out in
1217,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"sudden, short, and interrupted flashes: In Milton it glows like a"
1218,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,furnace kept up to an uncommon ardour by the force of art: in
1219,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Shakspeare it strikes before we are aware, like an accidental fire from"
1220,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"heaven: but in Homer, and in him only, it burns everywhere clearly and"
1221,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,everywhere irresistibly.
1222,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1223,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,I shall here endeavour to show how this vast invention exerts itself in
1224,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,a manner superior to that of any poet through all the main constituent
1225,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,parts of his work: as it is the great and peculiar characteristic which
1226,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,distinguishes him from all other authors.
1227,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1228,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"This strong and ruling faculty was like a powerful star, which, in the"
1229,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"violence of its course, drew all things within its vortex. It seemed"
1230,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"not enough to have taken in the whole circle of arts, and the whole"
1231,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"compass of nature, to supply his maxims and reflections; all the inward"
1232,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"passions and affections of mankind, to furnish his characters: and all"
1233,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,the outward forms and images of things for his descriptions: but
1234,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"wanting yet an ampler sphere to expatiate in, he opened a new and"
1235,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"boundless walk for his imagination, and created a world for himself in"
1236,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,the invention of fable. That which Aristotle calls “the soul of
1237,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"poetry,” was first breathed into it by Homer. I shall begin with"
1238,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"considering him in his part, as it is naturally the first; and I speak"
1239,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"of it both as it means the design of a poem, and as it is taken for"
1240,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,fiction.
1241,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1242,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1243,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Fable may be divided into the probable, the allegorical, and the"
1244,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"marvellous. The probable fable is the recital of such actions as,"
1245,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"though they did not happen, yet might, in the common course of nature;"
1246,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"or of such as, though they did, became fables by the additional"
1247,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,episodes and manner of telling them. Of this sort is the main story of
1248,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"an epic poem, “The return of Ulysses, the settlement of the Trojans in"
1249,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Italy,” or the like. That of the Iliad is the “anger of Achilles,” the"
1250,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,most short and single subject that ever was chosen by any poet. Yet
1251,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"this he has supplied with a vaster variety of incidents and events, and"
1252,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"crowded with a greater number of councils, speeches, battles, and"
1253,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"episodes of all kinds, than are to be found even in those poems whose"
1254,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,schemes are of the utmost latitude and irregularity. The action is
1255,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"hurried on with the most vehement spirit, and its whole duration"
1256,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"employs not so much as fifty days. Virgil, for want of so warm a"
1257,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"genius, aided himself by taking in a more extensive subject, as well as"
1258,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"a greater length of time, and contracting the design of both Homer’s"
1259,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"poems into one, which is yet but a fourth part as large as his. The"
1260,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"other epic poets have used the same practice, but generally carried it"
1261,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"so far as to superinduce a multiplicity of fables, destroy the unity of"
1262,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"action, and lose their readers in an unreasonable length of time. Nor"
1263,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,is it only in the main design that they have been unable to add to his
1264,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"invention, but they have followed him in every episode and part of"
1265,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"story. If he has given a regular catalogue of an army, they all draw up"
1266,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"their forces in the same order. If he has funeral games for Patroclus,"
1267,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Virgil has the same for Anchises, and Statius (rather than omit them)"
1268,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,destroys the unity of his actions for those of Archemorus. If Ulysses
1269,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"visit the shades, the Æneas of Virgil and Scipio of Silius are sent"
1270,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,after him. If he be detained from his return by the allurements of
1271,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Calypso, so is Æneas by Dido, and Rinaldo by Armida. If Achilles be"
1272,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"absent from the army on the score of a quarrel through half the poem,"
1273,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,Rinaldo must absent himself just as long on the like account. If he
1274,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"gives his hero a suit of celestial armour, Virgil and Tasso make the"
1275,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,same present to theirs. Virgil has not only observed this close
1276,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"imitation of Homer, but, where he had not led the way, supplied the"
1277,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"want from other Greek authors. Thus the story of Sinon, and the taking"
1278,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"of Troy, was copied (says Macrobius) almost word for word from"
1279,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Pisander, as the loves of Dido and Æneas are taken from those of Medea"
1280,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"and Jason in Apollonius, and several others in the same manner."
1281,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1282,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1283,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,To proceed to the allegorical fable—If we reflect upon those
1284,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"innumerable knowledges, those secrets of nature and physical philosophy"
1285,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"which Homer is generally supposed to have wrapped up in his allegories,"
1286,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,what a new and ample scene of wonder may this consideration afford us!
1287,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"How fertile will that imagination appear, which was able to clothe all"
1288,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"the properties of elements, the qualifications of the mind, the virtues"
1289,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"and vices, in forms and persons, and to introduce them into actions"
1290,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,agreeable to the nature of the things they shadowed! This is a field in
1291,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"which no succeeding poets could dispute with Homer, and whatever"
1292,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"commendations have been allowed them on this head, are by no means for"
1293,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"their invention in having enlarged his circle, but for their judgment"
1294,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,in having contracted it. For when the mode of learning changed in the
1295,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"following ages, and science was delivered in a plainer manner, it then"
1296,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"became as reasonable in the more modern poets to lay it aside, as it"
1297,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,was in Homer to make use of it. And perhaps it was no unhappy
1298,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"circumstance for Virgil, that there was not in his time that demand"
1299,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,upon him of so great an invention as might be capable of furnishing all
1300,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,those allegorical parts of a poem.
1301,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1302,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1303,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"The marvellous fable includes whatever is supernatural, and especially"
1304,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,the machines of the gods. If Homer was not the first who introduced the
1305,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"deities (as Herodotus imagines) into the religion of Greece, he seems"
1306,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"the first who brought them into a system of machinery for poetry, and"
1307,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,such a one as makes its greatest importance and dignity: for we find
1308,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"those authors who have been offended at the literal notion of the gods,"
1309,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,constantly laying their accusation against Homer as the chief support
1310,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,of it. But whatever cause there might be to blame his machines in a
1311,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"philosophical or religious view, they are so perfect in the poetic,"
1312,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,that mankind have been ever since contented to follow them: none have
1313,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,been able to enlarge the sphere of poetry beyond the limits he has set:
1314,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,every attempt of this nature has proved unsuccessful; and after all the
1315,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"various changes of times and religions, his gods continue to this day"
1316,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,the gods of poetry.
1317,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1318,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1319,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,We come now to the characters of his persons; and here we shall find no
1320,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"author has ever drawn so many, with so visible and surprising a"
1321,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"variety, or given us such lively and affecting impressions of them."
1322,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Every one has something so singularly his own, that no painter could"
1323,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"have distinguished them more by their features, than the poet has by"
1324,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,their manners. Nothing can be more exact than the distinctions he has
1325,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,observed in the different degrees of virtues and vices. The single
1326,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,quality of courage is wonderfully diversified in the several characters
1327,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,of the Iliad. That of Achilles is furious and intractable; that of
1328,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Diomede forward, yet listening to advice, and subject to command; that"
1329,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"of Ajax is heavy and self-confiding; of Hector, active and vigilant:"
1330,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,the courage of Agamemnon is inspirited by love of empire and ambition;
1331,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,that of Menelaus mixed with softness and tenderness for his people: we
1332,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,find in Idomeneus a plain direct soldier; in Sarpedon a gallant and
1333,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,generous one. Nor is this judicious and astonishing diversity to be
1334,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,found only in the principal quality which constitutes the main of each
1335,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"character, but even in the under parts of it, to which he takes care to"
1336,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,give a tincture of that principal one. For example: the main characters
1337,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"of Ulysses and Nestor consist in wisdom; and they are distinct in this,"
1338,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"that the wisdom of one is artificial and various, of the other natural,"
1339,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"open, and regular. But they have, besides, characters of courage; and"
1340,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,this quality also takes a different turn in each from the difference of
1341,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"his prudence; for one in the war depends still upon caution, the other"
1342,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,upon experience. It would be endless to produce instances of these
1343,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,kinds. The characters of Virgil are far from striking us in this open
1344,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"manner; they lie, in a great degree, hidden and undistinguished; and,"
1345,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,where they are marked most evidently affect us not in proportion to
1346,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,those of Homer. His characters of valour are much alike; even that of
1347,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Turnus seems no way peculiar, but, as it is, in a superior degree; and"
1348,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,we see nothing that differences the courage of Mnestheus from that of
1349,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Sergestus, Cloanthus, or the rest. In like manner it may be remarked of"
1350,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Statius’s heroes, that an air of impetuosity runs through them all; the"
1351,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"same horrid and savage courage appears in his Capaneus, Tydeus,"
1352,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Hippomedon, &c. They have a parity of character, which makes them seem"
1353,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,brothers of one family. I believe when the reader is led into this
1354,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"tract of reflection, if he will pursue it through the epic and tragic"
1355,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"writers, he will be convinced how infinitely superior, in this point,"
1356,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,the invention of Homer was to that of all others.
1357,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1358,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1359,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,The speeches are to be considered as they flow from the characters;
1360,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"being perfect or defective as they agree or disagree with the manners,"
1361,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,of those who utter them. As there is more variety of characters in the
1362,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Iliad, so there is of speeches, than in any other poem. “Everything in"
1363,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"it has manner” (as Aristotle expresses it), that is, everything is"
1364,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"acted or spoken. It is hardly credible, in a work of such length, how"
1365,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,small a number of lines are employed in narration. In Virgil the
1366,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"dramatic part is less in proportion to the narrative, and the speeches"
1367,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"often consist of general reflections or thoughts, which might be"
1368,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,equally just in any person’s mouth upon the same occasion. As many of
1369,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"his persons have no apparent characters, so many of his speeches escape"
1370,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,being applied and judged by the rule of propriety. We oftener think of
1371,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"the author himself when we read Virgil, than when we are engaged in"
1372,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Homer, all which are the effects of a colder invention, that interests"
1373,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"us less in the action described. Homer makes us hearers, and Virgil"
1374,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,leaves us readers.
1375,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1376,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1377,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"If, in the next place, we take a view of the sentiments, the same"
1378,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,presiding faculty is eminent in the sublimity and spirit of his
1379,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"thoughts. Longinus has given his opinion, that it was in this part"
1380,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,Homer principally excelled. What were alone sufficient to prove the
1381,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"grandeur and excellence of his sentiments in general, is, that they"
1382,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"have so remarkable a parity with those of the Scripture. Duport, in his"
1383,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Gnomologia Homerica, has collected innumerable instances of this sort."
1384,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"And it is with justice an excellent modern writer allows, that if"
1385,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Virgil has not so many thoughts that are low and vulgar, he has not so"
1386,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,many that are sublime and noble; and that the Roman author seldom rises
1387,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,into very astonishing sentiments where he is not fired by the Iliad.
1388,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1389,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1390,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"If we observe his descriptions, images, and similes, we shall find the"
1391,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,invention still predominant. To what else can we ascribe that vast
1392,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"comprehension of images of every sort, where we see each circumstance"
1393,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"of art, and individual of nature, summoned together by the extent and"
1394,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"fecundity of his imagination to which all things, in their various"
1395,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"views presented themselves in an instant, and had their impressions"
1396,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"taken off to perfection at a heat? Nay, he not only gives us the full"
1397,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"prospects of things, but several unexpected peculiarities and side"
1398,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"views, unobserved by any painter but Homer. Nothing is so surprising as"
1399,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"the descriptions of his battles, which take up no less than half the"
1400,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Iliad, and are supplied with so vast a variety of incidents, that no"
1401,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"one bears a likeness to another; such different kinds of deaths, that"
1402,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"no two heroes are wounded in the same manner, and such a profusion of"
1403,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"noble ideas, that every battle rises above the last in greatness,"
1404,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"horror, and confusion. It is certain there is not near that number of"
1405,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"images and descriptions in any epic poet, though every one has assisted"
1406,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,himself with a great quantity out of him; and it is evident of Virgil
1407,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"especially, that he has scarce any comparisons which are not drawn from"
1408,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,his master.
1409,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1410,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1411,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"If we descend from hence to the expression, we see the bright"
1412,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,imagination of Homer shining out in the most enlivened forms of it. We
1413,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,acknowledge him the father of poetical diction; the first who taught
1414,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,that “language of the gods” to men. His expression is like the
1415,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"colouring of some great masters, which discovers itself to be laid on"
1416,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"boldly, and executed with rapidity. It is, indeed, the strongest and"
1417,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"most glowing imaginable, and touched with the greatest spirit."
1418,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Aristotle had reason to say, he was the only poet who had found out"
1419,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,“living words;” there are in him more daring figures and metaphors than
1420,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"in any good author whatever. An arrow is “impatient” to be on the wing,"
1421,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"a weapon “thirsts” to drink the blood of an enemy, and the like, yet"
1422,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"his expression is never too big for the sense, but justly great in"
1423,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,proportion to it. It is the sentiment that swells and fills out the
1424,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"diction, which rises with it, and forms itself about it, for in the"
1425,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"same degree that a thought is warmer, an expression will be brighter,"
1426,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"as that is more strong, this will become more perspicuous; like glass"
1427,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"in the furnace, which grows to a greater magnitude, and refines to a"
1428,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"greater clearness, only as the breath within is more powerful, and the"
1429,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,heat more intense.
1430,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1431,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1432,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"To throw his language more out of prose, Homer seems to have affected"
1433,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,the compound epithets. This was a sort of composition peculiarly proper
1434,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"to poetry, not only as it heightened the diction, but as it assisted"
1435,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"and filled the numbers with greater sound and pomp, and likewise"
1436,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,conduced in some measure to thicken the images. On this last
1437,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,consideration I cannot but attribute these also to the fruitfulness of
1438,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"his invention, since (as he has managed them) they are a sort of"
1439,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,supernumerary pictures of the persons or things to which they were
1440,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,joined. We see the motion of Hector’s plumes in the epithet
1441,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Κορυθαίολος, the landscape of Mount Neritus in that of Εἰνοσίφυλλος,"
1442,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"and so of others, which particular images could not have been insisted"
1443,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,upon so long as to express them in a description (though but of a
1444,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,single line) without diverting the reader too much from the principal
1445,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"action or figure. As a metaphor is a short simile, one of these"
1446,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,epithets is a short description.
1447,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1448,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1449,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Lastly, if we consider his versification, we shall be sensible what a"
1450,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,share of praise is due to his invention in that also. He was not
1451,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,satisfied with his language as he found it settled in any one part of
1452,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Greece, but searched through its different dialects with this"
1453,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"particular view, to beautify and perfect his numbers he considered"
1454,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"these as they had a greater mixture of vowels or consonants, and"
1455,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,accordingly employed them as the verse required either a greater
1456,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"smoothness or strength. What he most affected was the Ionic, which has"
1457,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"a peculiar sweetness, from its never using contractions, and from its"
1458,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"custom of resolving the diphthongs into two syllables, so as to make"
1459,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,the words open themselves with a more spreading and sonorous fluency.
1460,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"With this he mingled the Attic contractions, the broader Doric, and the"
1461,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"feebler Æolic, which often rejects its aspirate, or takes off its"
1462,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"accent, and completed this variety by altering some letters with the"
1463,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"licence of poetry. Thus his measures, instead of being fetters to his"
1464,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"sense, were always in readiness to run along with the warmth of his"
1465,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"rapture, and even to give a further representation of his notions, in"
1466,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,the correspondence of their sounds to what they signified. Out of all
1467,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,these he has derived that harmony which makes us confess he had not
1468,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"only the richest head, but the finest ear in the world. This is so"
1469,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"great a truth, that whoever will but consult the tune of his verses,"
1470,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,even without understanding them (with the same sort of diligence as we
1471,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"daily see practised in the case of Italian operas), will find more"
1472,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"sweetness, variety, and majesty of sound, than in any other language of"
1473,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,poetry. The beauty of his numbers is allowed by the critics to be
1474,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"copied but faintly by Virgil himself, though they are so just as to"
1475,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,ascribe it to the nature of the Latin tongue: indeed the Greek has some
1476,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"advantages both from the natural sound of its words, and the turn and"
1477,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"cadence of its verse, which agree with the genius of no other language."
1478,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Virgil was very sensible of this, and used the utmost diligence in"
1479,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,working up a more intractable language to whatsoever graces it was
1480,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"capable of, and, in particular, never failed to bring the sound of his"
1481,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,line to a beautiful agreement with its sense. If the Grecian poet has
1482,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"not been so frequently celebrated on this account as the Roman, the"
1483,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"only reason is, that fewer critics have understood one language than"
1484,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,the other. Dionysius of Halicarnassus has pointed out many of our
1485,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"author’s beauties in this kind, in his treatise of the Composition of"
1486,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Words. It suffices at present to observe of his numbers, that they flow"
1487,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"with so much ease, as to make one imagine Homer had no other care than"
1488,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"to transcribe as fast as the Muses dictated, and, at the same time,"
1489,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"with so much force and inspiriting vigour, that they awaken and raise"
1490,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"us like the sound of a trumpet. They roll along as a plentiful river,"
1491,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"always in motion, and always full; while we are borne away by a tide of"
1492,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"verse, the most rapid, and yet the most smooth imaginable."
1493,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1494,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1495,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Thus on whatever side we contemplate Homer, what principally strikes us"
1496,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,is his invention. It is that which forms the character of each part of
1497,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,his work; and accordingly we find it to have made his fable more
1498,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"extensive and copious than any other, his manners more lively and"
1499,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"strongly marked, his speeches more affecting and transported, his"
1500,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"sentiments more warm and sublime, his images and descriptions more full"
1501,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"and animated, his expression more raised and daring, and his numbers"
1502,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"more rapid and various. I hope, in what has been said of Virgil, with"
1503,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"regard to any of these heads, I have no way derogated from his"
1504,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"character. Nothing is more absurd or endless, than the common method of"
1505,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,comparing eminent writers by an opposition of particular passages in
1506,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"them, and forming a judgment from thence of their merit upon the whole."
1507,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,We ought to have a certain knowledge of the principal character and
1508,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,distinguishing excellence of each: it is in that we are to consider
1509,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"him, and in proportion to his degree in that we are to admire him. No"
1510,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,author or man ever excelled all the world in more than one faculty; and
1511,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"as Homer has done this in invention, Virgil has in judgment. Not that"
1512,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"we are to think that Homer wanted judgment, because Virgil had it in a"
1513,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"more eminent degree; or that Virgil wanted invention, because Homer"
1514,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,possessed a larger share of it; each of these great authors had more of
1515,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"both than perhaps any man besides, and are only said to have less in"
1516,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"comparison with one another. Homer was the greater genius, Virgil the"
1517,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"better artist. In one we most admire the man, in the other the work."
1518,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,Homer hurries and transports us with a commanding impetuosity; Virgil
1519,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,leads us with an attractive majesty; Homer scatters with a generous
1520,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"profusion; Virgil bestows with a careful magnificence; Homer, like the"
1521,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Nile, pours out his riches with a boundless overflow; Virgil, like a"
1522,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"river in its banks, with a gentle and constant stream. When we behold"
1523,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"their battles, methinks the two poets resemble the heroes they"
1524,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"celebrate. Homer, boundless and resistless as Achilles, bears all"
1525,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"before him, and shines more and more as the tumult increases; Virgil,"
1526,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"calmly daring, like Æneas, appears undisturbed in the midst of the"
1527,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"action; disposes all about him, and conquers with tranquillity. And"
1528,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"when we look upon their machines, Homer seems like his own Jupiter in"
1529,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"his terrors, shaking Olympus, scattering the lightnings, and firing the"
1530,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"heavens: Virgil, like the same power in his benevolence, counselling"
1531,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"with the gods, laying plans for empires, and regularly ordering his"
1532,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,whole creation.
1533,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1534,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1535,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"But after all, it is with great parts, as with great virtues, they"
1536,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,naturally border on some imperfection; and it is often hard to
1537,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"distinguish exactly where the virtue ends, or the fault begins. As"
1538,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"prudence may sometimes sink to suspicion, so may a great judgment"
1539,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,decline to coldness; and as magnanimity may run up to profusion or
1540,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"extravagance, so may a great invention to redundancy or wildness. If we"
1541,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"look upon Homer in this view, we shall perceive the chief objections"
1542,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,against him to proceed from so noble a cause as the excess of this
1543,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,faculty.
1544,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1545,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1546,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Among these we may reckon some of his marvellous fictions, upon which"
1547,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"so much criticism has been spent, as surpassing all the bounds of"
1548,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"probability. Perhaps it may be with great and superior souls, as with"
1549,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"gigantic bodies, which, exerting themselves with unusual strength,"
1550,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"exceed what is commonly thought the due proportion of parts, to become"
1551,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"miracles in the whole; and, like the old heroes of that make, commit"
1552,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"something near extravagance, amidst a series of glorious and inimitable"
1553,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,performances. Thus Homer has his “speaking horses;” and Virgil his
1554,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,“myrtles distilling blood;” where the latter has not so much as
1555,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,contrived the easy intervention of a deity to save the probability.
1556,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1557,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1558,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"It is owing to the same vast invention, that his similes have been"
1559,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,thought too exuberant and full of circumstances. The force of this
1560,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"faculty is seen in nothing more, than in its inability to confine"
1561,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,itself to that single circumstance upon which the comparison is
1562,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"grounded: it runs out into embellishments of additional images, which,"
1563,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"however, are so managed as not to overpower the main one. His similes"
1564,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"are like pictures, where the principal figure has not only its"
1565,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"proportion given agreeable to the original, but is also set off with"
1566,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,occasional ornaments and prospects. The same will account for his
1567,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"manner of heaping a number of comparisons together in one breath, when"
1568,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,his fancy suggested to him at once so many various and correspondent
1569,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,images. The reader will easily extend this observation to more
1570,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,objections of the same kind.
1571,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1572,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1573,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,If there are others which seem rather to charge him with a defect or
1574,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"narrowness of genius, than an excess of it, those seeming defects will"
1575,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,be found upon examination to proceed wholly from the nature of the
1576,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,times he lived in. Such are his grosser representations of the gods;
1577,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,and the vicious and imperfect manners of his heroes; but I must here
1578,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"speak a word of the latter, as it is a point generally carried into"
1579,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"extremes, both by the censurers and defenders of Homer. It must be a"
1580,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"strange partiality to antiquity, to think with Madame Dacier,[38] “that"
1581,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"those times and manners are so much the more excellent, as they are"
1582,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,more contrary to ours.” Who can be so prejudiced in their favour as to
1583,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"magnify the felicity of those ages, when a spirit of revenge and"
1584,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"cruelty, joined with the practice of rapine and robbery, reigned"
1585,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,through the world: when no mercy was shown but for the sake of lucre;
1586,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"when the greatest princes were put to the sword, and their wives and"
1587,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"daughters made slaves and concubines? On the other side, I would not be"
1588,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"so delicate as those modern critics, who are shocked at the servile"
1589,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,offices and mean employments in which we sometimes see the heroes of
1590,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Homer engaged. There is a pleasure in taking a view of that simplicity,"
1591,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,in opposition to the luxury of succeeding ages: in beholding monarchs
1592,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"without their guards; princes tending their flocks, and princesses"
1593,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"drawing water from the springs. When we read Homer, we ought to reflect"
1594,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,that we are reading the most ancient author in the heathen world; and
1595,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"those who consider him in this light, will double their pleasure in the"
1596,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,perusal of him. Let them think they are growing acquainted with nations
1597,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,and people that are now no more; that they are stepping almost three
1598,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"thousand years back into the remotest antiquity, and entertaining"
1599,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,themselves with a clear and surprising vision of things nowhere else to
1600,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"be found, the only true mirror of that ancient world. By this means"
1601,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,alone their greatest obstacles will vanish; and what usually creates
1602,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"their dislike, will become a satisfaction."
1603,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1604,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,This consideration may further serve to answer for the constant use of
1605,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,the same epithets to his gods and heroes; such as the “far-darting
1606,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Phœbus,” the “blue-eyed Pallas,” the “swift-footed Achilles,” &c.,"
1607,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"which some have censured as impertinent, and tediously repeated. Those"
1608,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,of the gods depended upon the powers and offices then believed to
1609,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,belong to them; and had contracted a weight and veneration from the
1610,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,rites and solemn devotions in which they were used: they were a sort of
1611,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,attributes with which it was a matter of religion to salute them on all
1612,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"occasions, and which it was an irreverence to omit. As for the epithets"
1613,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"of great men, Mons. Boileau is of opinion, that they were in the nature"
1614,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"of surnames, and repeated as such; for the Greeks having no names"
1615,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"derived from their fathers, were obliged to add some other distinction"
1616,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"of each person; either naming his parents expressly, or his place of"
1617,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"birth, profession, or the like: as Alexander the son of Philip,"
1618,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Herodotus of Halicarnassus, Diogenes the Cynic, &c. Homer, therefore,"
1619,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"complying with the custom of his country, used such distinctive"
1620,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"additions as better agreed with poetry. And, indeed, we have something"
1621,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"parallel to these in modern times, such as the names of Harold"
1622,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Harefoot, Edmund Ironside, Edward Longshanks, Edward the Black Prince,"
1623,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,&c. If yet this be thought to account better for the propriety than for
1624,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"the repetition, I shall add a further conjecture. Hesiod, dividing the"
1625,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"world into its different ages, has placed a fourth age, between the"
1626,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"brazen and the iron one, of “heroes distinct from other men; a divine"
1627,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"race who fought at Thebes and Troy, are called demi-gods, and live by"
1628,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,the care of Jupiter in the islands of the blessed.”[39] Now among the
1629,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"divine honours which were paid them, they might have this also in"
1630,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"common with the gods, not to be mentioned without the solemnity of an"
1631,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"epithet, and such as might be acceptable to them by celebrating their"
1632,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"families, actions or qualities."
1633,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1634,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"What other cavils have been raised against Homer, are such as hardly"
1635,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"deserve a reply, but will yet be taken notice of as they occur in the"
1636,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,course of the work. Many have been occasioned by an injudicious
1637,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"endeavour to exalt Virgil; which is much the same, as if one should"
1638,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,think to raise the superstructure by undermining the foundation: one
1639,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"would imagine, by the whole course of their parallels, that these"
1640,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,critics never so much as heard of Homer’s having written first; a
1641,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,consideration which whoever compares these two poets ought to have
1642,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,always in his eye. Some accuse him for the same things which they
1643,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,overlook or praise in the other; as when they prefer the fable and
1644,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"moral of the Æneis to those of the Iliad, for the same reasons which"
1645,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"might set the Odyssey above the Æneis; as that the hero is a wiser man,"
1646,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,and the action of the one more beneficial to his country than that of
1647,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,the other; or else they blame him for not doing what he never designed;
1648,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"as because Achilles is not as good and perfect a prince as Æneas, when"
1649,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,the very moral of his poem required a contrary character: it is thus
1650,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,that Rapin judges in his comparison of Homer and Virgil. Others select
1651,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,those particular passages of Homer which are not so laboured as some
1652,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,that Virgil drew out of them: this is the whole management of Scaliger
1653,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,in his Poetics. Others quarrel with what they take for low and mean
1654,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"expressions, sometimes through a false delicacy and refinement, oftener"
1655,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"from an ignorance of the graces of the original, and then triumph in"
1656,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,the awkwardness of their own translations: this is the conduct of
1657,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Perrault in his Parallels. Lastly, there are others, who, pretending to"
1658,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"a fairer proceeding, distinguish between the personal merit of Homer,"
1659,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,and that of his work; but when they come to assign the causes of the
1660,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"great reputation of the Iliad, they found it upon the ignorance of his"
1661,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"times, and the prejudice of those that followed; and in pursuance of"
1662,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"this principle, they make those accidents (such as the contention of"
1663,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"the cities, &c.) to be the causes of his fame, which were in reality"
1664,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,the consequences of his merit. The same might as well be said of
1665,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Virgil, or any great author whose general character will infallibly"
1666,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,raise many casual additions to their reputation. This is the method of
1667,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,Mons. de la Mott; who yet confesses upon the whole that in whatever age
1668,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Homer had lived, he must have been the greatest poet of his nation, and"
1669,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,that he may be said in his sense to be the master even of those who
1670,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,surpassed him.
1671,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1672,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,In all these objections we see nothing that contradicts his title to
1673,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,the honour of the chief invention: and as long as this (which is indeed
1674,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,the characteristic of poetry itself) remains unequalled by his
1675,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"followers, he still continues superior to them. A cooler judgment may"
1676,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"commit fewer faults, and be more approved in the eyes of one sort of"
1677,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,critics: but that warmth of fancy will carry the loudest and most
1678,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,universal applauses which holds the heart of a reader under the
1679,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"strongest enchantment. Homer not only appears the inventor of poetry,"
1680,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"but excels all the inventors of other arts, in this, that he has"
1681,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,swallowed up the honour of those who succeeded him. What he has done
1682,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"admitted no increase, it only left room for contraction or regulation."
1683,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,He showed all the stretch of fancy at once; and if he has failed in
1684,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"some of his flights, it was but because he attempted everything. A work"
1685,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"of this kind seems like a mighty tree, which rises from the most"
1686,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"vigorous seed, is improved with industry, flourishes, and produces the"
1687,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,finest fruit: nature and art conspire to raise it; pleasure and profit
1688,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"join to make it valuable: and they who find the justest faults, have"
1689,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,only said that a few branches which run luxuriant through a richness of
1690,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"nature, might be lopped into form to give it a more regular appearance."
1691,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1692,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Having now spoken of the beauties and defects of the original, it"
1693,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"remains to treat of the translation, with the same view to the chief"
1694,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"characteristic. As far as that is seen in the main parts of the poem,"
1695,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"such as the fable, manners, and sentiments, no translator can prejudice"
1696,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,it but by wilful omissions or contractions. As it also breaks out in
1697,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"every particular image, description, and simile, whoever lessens or too"
1698,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"much softens those, takes off from this chief character. It is the"
1699,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,first grand duty of an interpreter to give his author entire and
1700,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"unmaimed; and for the rest, the diction and versification only are his"
1701,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"proper province, since these must be his own, but the others he is to"
1702,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,take as he finds them.
1703,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1704,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,It should then be considered what methods may afford some equivalent in
1705,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,our language for the graces of these in the Greek. It is certain no
1706,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,literal translation can be just to an excellent original in a superior
1707,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,language: but it is a great mistake to imagine (as many have done) that
1708,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,a rash paraphrase can make amends for this general defect; which is no
1709,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"less in danger to lose the spirit of an ancient, by deviating into the"
1710,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"modern manners of expression. If there be sometimes a darkness, there"
1711,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"is often a light in antiquity, which nothing better preserves than a"
1712,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"version almost literal. I know no liberties one ought to take, but"
1713,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"those which are necessary to transfusing the spirit of the original,"
1714,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,and supporting the poetical style of the translation: and I will
1715,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"venture to say, there have not been more men misled in former times by"
1716,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"a servile, dull adherence to the letter, than have been deluded in ours"
1717,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"by a chimerical, insolent hope of raising and improving their author."
1718,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"It is not to be doubted, that the fire of the poem is what a translator"
1719,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"should principally regard, as it is most likely to expire in his"
1720,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"managing: however, it is his safest way to be content with preserving"
1721,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"this to his utmost in the whole, without endeavouring to be more than"
1722,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"he finds his author is, in any particular place. It is a great secret"
1723,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"in writing, to know when to be plain, and when poetical and figurative;"
1724,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"and it is what Homer will teach us, if we will but follow modestly in"
1725,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"his footsteps. Where his diction is bold and lofty, let us raise ours"
1726,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"as high as we can; but where his is plain and humble, we ought not to"
1727,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,be deterred from imitating him by the fear of incurring the censure of
1728,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,a mere English critic. Nothing that belongs to Homer seems to have been
1729,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,more commonly mistaken than the just pitch of his style: some of his
1730,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,translators having swelled into fustian in a proud confidence of the
1731,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"sublime; others sunk into flatness, in a cold and timorous notion of"
1732,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"simplicity. Methinks I see these different followers of Homer, some"
1733,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,sweating and straining after him by violent leaps and bounds (the
1734,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"certain signs of false mettle), others slowly and servilely creeping in"
1735,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"his train, while the poet himself is all the time proceeding with an"
1736,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"unaffected and equal majesty before them. However, of the two extremes"
1737,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,one could sooner pardon frenzy than frigidity; no author is to be
1738,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"envied for such commendations, as he may gain by that character of"
1739,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"style, which his friends must agree together to call simplicity, and"
1740,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,the rest of the world will call dulness. There is a graceful and
1741,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"dignified simplicity, as well as a bold and sordid one; which differ as"
1742,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,much from each other as the air of a plain man from that of a sloven:
1743,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"it is one thing to be tricked up, and another not to be dressed at all."
1744,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,Simplicity is the mean between ostentation and rusticity.
1745,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1746,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,This pure and noble simplicity is nowhere in such perfection as in the
1747,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Scripture and our author. One may affirm, with all respect to the"
1748,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"inspired writings, that the Divine Spirit made use of no other words"
1749,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"but what were intelligible and common to men at that time, and in that"
1750,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"part of the world; and, as Homer is the author nearest to those, his"
1751,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,style must of course bear a greater resemblance to the sacred books
1752,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,than that of any other writer. This consideration (together with what
1753,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"has been observed of the parity of some of his thoughts) may, methinks,"
1754,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"induce a translator, on the one hand, to give in to several of those"
1755,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"general phrases and manners of expression, which have attained a"
1756,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,veneration even in our language from being used in the Old Testament;
1757,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"as, on the other, to avoid those which have been appropriated to the"
1758,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Divinity, and in a manner consigned to mystery and religion."
1759,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1760,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"For a further preservation of this air of simplicity, a particular care"
1761,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,should be taken to express with all plainness those moral sentences and
1762,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,proverbial speeches which are so numerous in this poet. They have
1763,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"something venerable, and as I may say, oracular, in that unadorned"
1764,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,gravity and shortness with which they are delivered: a grace which
1765,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,would be utterly lost by endeavouring to give them what we call a more
1766,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"ingenious (that is, a more modern) turn in the paraphrase."
1767,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1768,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,Perhaps the mixture of some Græcisms and old words after the manner of
1769,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Milton, if done without too much affectation, might not have an ill"
1770,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"effect in a version of this particular work, which most of any other"
1771,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"seems to require a venerable, antique cast. But certainly the use of"
1772,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"modern terms of war and government, such as “platoon, campaign, junto,”"
1773,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"or the like, (into which some of his translators have fallen) cannot be"
1774,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,allowable; those only excepted without which it is impossible to treat
1775,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,the subjects in any living language.
1776,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1777,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"There are two peculiarities in Homer’s diction, which are a sort of"
1778,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,marks or moles by which every common eye distinguishes him at first
1779,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,sight; those who are not his greatest admirers look upon them as
1780,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"defects, and those who are, seemed pleased with them as beauties. I"
1781,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"speak of his compound epithets, and of his repetitions. Many of the"
1782,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,former cannot be done literally into English without destroying the
1783,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,purity of our language. I believe such should be retained as slide
1784,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"easily of themselves into an English compound, without violence to the"
1785,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"ear or to the received rules of composition, as well as those which"
1786,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"have received a sanction from the authority of our best poets, and are"
1787,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,become familiar through their use of them; such as “the
1788,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"cloud-compelling Jove,” &c. As for the rest, whenever any can be as"
1789,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,fully and significantly expressed in a single word as in a compounded
1790,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"one, the course to be taken is obvious."
1791,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1792,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Some that cannot be so turned, as to preserve their full image by one"
1793,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"or two words, may have justice done them by circumlocution; as the"
1794,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"epithet einosiphyllos to a mountain, would appear little or ridiculous"
1795,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"translated literally “leaf-shaking,” but affords a majestic idea in the"
1796,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,periphrasis: “the lofty mountain shakes his waving woods.” Others that
1797,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"admit of different significations, may receive an advantage from a"
1798,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"judicious variation, according to the occasions on which they are"
1799,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"introduced. For example, the epithet of Apollo, ἑκηβόλος or"
1800,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"“far-shooting,” is capable of two explications; one literal, in respect"
1801,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"of the darts and bow, the ensigns of that god; the other allegorical,"
1802,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"with regard to the rays of the sun; therefore, in such places where"
1803,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Apollo is represented as a god in person, I would use the former"
1804,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"interpretation; and where the effects of the sun are described, I would"
1805,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"make choice of the latter. Upon the whole, it will be necessary to"
1806,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,avoid that perpetual repetition of the same epithets which we find in
1807,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Homer, and which, though it might be accommodated (as has been already"
1808,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"shown) to the ear of those times, is by no means so to ours: but one"
1809,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"may wait for opportunities of placing them, where they derive an"
1810,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,additional beauty from the occasions on which they are employed; and in
1811,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"doing this properly, a translator may at once show his fancy and his"
1812,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,judgment.
1813,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1814,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"As for Homer’s repetitions, we may divide them into three sorts: of"
1815,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"whole narrations and speeches, of single sentences, and of one verse or"
1816,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"hemistitch. I hope it is not impossible to have such a regard to these,"
1817,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"as neither to lose so known a mark of the author on the one hand, nor"
1818,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,to offend the reader too much on the other. The repetition is not
1819,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"ungraceful in those speeches, where the dignity of the speaker renders"
1820,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,it a sort of insolence to alter his words; as in the messages from gods
1821,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"to men, or from higher powers to inferiors in concerns of state, or"
1822,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"where the ceremonial of religion seems to require it, in the solemn"
1823,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"forms of prayers, oaths, or the like. In other cases, I believe the"
1824,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"best rule is, to be guided by the nearness, or distance, at which the"
1825,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"repetitions are placed in the original: when they follow too close, one"
1826,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"may vary the expression; but it is a question, whether a professed"
1827,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"translator be authorized to omit any: if they be tedious, the author is"
1828,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,to answer for it.
1829,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1830,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,It only remains to speak of the versification. Homer (as has been said)
1831,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"is perpetually applying the sound to the sense, and varying it on every"
1832,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,new subject. This is indeed one of the most exquisite beauties of
1833,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"poetry, and attainable by very few: I only know of Homer eminent for it"
1834,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"in the Greek, and Virgil in the Latin. I am sensible it is what may"
1835,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"sometimes happen by chance, when a writer is warm, and fully possessed"
1836,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"of his image: however, it may reasonably be believed they designed"
1837,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"this, in whose verse it so manifestly appears in a superior degree to"
1838,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,all others. Few readers have the ear to be judges of it: but those who
1839,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"have, will see I have endeavoured at this beauty."
1840,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1841,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Upon the whole, I must confess myself utterly incapable of doing"
1842,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,justice to Homer. I attempt him in no other hope but that which one may
1843,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"entertain without much vanity, of giving a more tolerable copy of him"
1844,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,than any entire translation in verse has yet done. We have only those
1845,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"of Chapman, Hobbes, and Ogilby. Chapman has taken the advantage of an"
1846,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"immeasurable length of verse, notwithstanding which, there is scarce"
1847,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,any paraphrase more loose and rambling than his. He has frequent
1848,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,interpolations of four or six lines; and I remember one in the
1849,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"thirteenth book of the Odyssey, ver. 312, where he has spun twenty"
1850,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"verses out of two. He is often mistaken in so bold a manner, that one"
1851,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"might think he deviated on purpose, if he did not in other places of"
1852,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,his notes insist so much upon verbal trifles. He appears to have had a
1853,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,strong affectation of extracting new meanings out of his author;
1854,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"insomuch as to promise, in his rhyming preface, a poem of the mysteries"
1855,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,he had revealed in Homer; and perhaps he endeavoured to strain the
1856,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,obvious sense to this end. His expression is involved in fustian; a
1857,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"fault for which he was remarkable in his original writings, as in the"
1858,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"tragedy of Bussy d’Amboise, &c. In a word, the nature of the man may"
1859,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"account for his whole performance; for he appears, from his preface and"
1860,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"remarks, to have been of an arrogant turn, and an enthusiast in poetry."
1861,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"His own boast, of having finished half the Iliad in less than fifteen"
1862,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"weeks, shows with what negligence his version was performed. But that"
1863,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"which is to be allowed him, and which very much contributed to cover"
1864,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"his defects, is a daring fiery spirit that animates his translation,"
1865,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,which is something like what one might imagine Homer himself would have
1866,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,writ before he arrived at years of discretion.
1867,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1868,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,Hobbes has given us a correct explanation of the sense in general; but
1869,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"for particulars and circumstances he continually lops them, and often"
1870,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,omits the most beautiful. As for its being esteemed a close
1871,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"translation, I doubt not many have been led into that error by the"
1872,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"shortness of it, which proceeds not from his following the original"
1873,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"line by line, but from the contractions above mentioned. He sometimes"
1874,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,omits whole similes and sentences; and is now and then guilty of
1875,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"mistakes, into which no writer of his learning could have fallen, but"
1876,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"through carelessness. His poetry, as well as Ogilby’s, is too mean for"
1877,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,criticism.
1878,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1879,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,It is a great loss to the poetical world that Mr. Dryden did not live
1880,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"to translate the Iliad. He has left us only the first book, and a small"
1881,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,part of the sixth; in which if he has in some places not truly
1882,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"interpreted the sense, or preserved the antiquities, it ought to be"
1883,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,excused on account of the haste he was obliged to write in. He seems to
1884,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"have had too much regard to Chapman, whose words he sometimes copies,"
1885,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,and has unhappily followed him in passages where he wanders from the
1886,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"original. However, had he translated the whole work, I would no more"
1887,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,have attempted Homer after him than Virgil: his version of whom
1888,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,(notwithstanding some human errors) is the most noble and spirited
1889,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,translation I know in any language. But the fate of great geniuses is
1890,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,like that of great ministers: though they are confessedly the first in
1891,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"the commonwealth of letters, they must be envied and calumniated only"
1892,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,for being at the head of it.
1893,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1894,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"That which, in my opinion, ought to be the endeavour of any one who"
1895,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"translates Homer, is above all things to keep alive that spirit and"
1896,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"fire which makes his chief character: in particular places, where the"
1897,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"sense can bear any doubt, to follow the strongest and most poetical, as"
1898,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,most agreeing with that character; to copy him in all the variations of
1899,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"his style, and the different modulations of his numbers; to preserve,"
1900,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"in the more active or descriptive parts, a warmth and elevation; in the"
1901,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"more sedate or narrative, a plainness and solemnity; in the speeches, a"
1902,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"fulness and perspicuity; in the sentences, a shortness and gravity; not"
1903,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"to neglect even the little figures and turns on the words, nor"
1904,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,sometimes the very cast of the periods; neither to omit nor confound
1905,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,any rites or customs of antiquity: perhaps too he ought to include the
1906,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,whole in a shorter compass than has hitherto been done by any
1907,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,translator who has tolerably preserved either the sense or poetry. What
1908,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"I would further recommend to him is, to study his author rather from"
1909,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"his own text, than from any commentaries, how learned soever, or"
1910,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,whatever figure they may make in the estimation of the world; to
1911,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,consider him attentively in comparison with Virgil above all the
1912,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"ancients, and with Milton above all the moderns. Next these, the"
1913,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,Archbishop of Cambray’s Telemachus may give him the truest idea of the
1914,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,spirit and turn of our author; and Bossu’s admirable Treatise of the
1915,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Epic Poem the justest notion of his design and conduct. But after all,"
1916,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"with whatever judgment and study a man may proceed, or with whatever"
1917,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"happiness he may perform such a work, he must hope to please but a few;"
1918,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"those only who have at once a taste of poetry, and competent learning."
1919,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"For to satisfy such a want either, is not in the nature of this"
1920,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,undertaking; since a mere modern wit can like nothing that is not
1921,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"modern, and a pedant nothing that is not Greek."
1922,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1923,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,What I have done is submitted to the public; from whose opinions I am
1924,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"prepared to learn; though I fear no judges so little as our best poets,"
1925,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"who are most sensible of the weight of this task. As for the worst,"
1926,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"whatever they shall please to say, they may give me some concern as"
1927,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"they are unhappy men, but none as they are malignant writers. I was"
1928,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"guided in this translation by judgments very different from theirs, and"
1929,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"by persons for whom they can have no kindness, if an old observation be"
1930,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"true, that the strongest antipathy in the world is that of fools to men"
1931,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,of wit. Mr. Addison was the first whose advice determined me to
1932,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,undertake this task; who was pleased to write to me upon that occasion
1933,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,in such terms as I cannot repeat without vanity. I was obliged to Sir
1934,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,Richard Steele for a very early recommendation of my undertaking to the
1935,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,public. Dr. Swift promoted my interest with that warmth with which he
1936,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,always serves his friend. The humanity and frankness of Sir Samuel
1937,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,Garth are what I never knew wanting on any occasion. I must also
1938,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"acknowledge, with infinite pleasure, the many friendly offices, as well"
1939,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"as sincere criticisms, of Mr. Congreve, who had led me the way in"
1940,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"translating some parts of Homer. I must add the names of Mr. Rowe, and"
1941,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Dr. Parnell, though I shall take a further opportunity of doing justice"
1942,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"to the last, whose good nature (to give it a great panegyric), is no"
1943,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,less extensive than his learning. The favour of these gentlemen is not
1944,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,entirely undeserved by one who bears them so true an affection. But
1945,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,what can I say of the honour so many of the great have done me; while
1946,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"the first names of the age appear as my subscribers, and the most"
1947,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,distinguished patrons and ornaments of learning as my chief
1948,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"encouragers? Among these it is a particular pleasure to me to find,"
1949,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,that my highest obligations are to such who have done most honour to
1950,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,the name of poet: that his grace the Duke of Buckingham was not
1951,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,displeased I should undertake the author to whom he has given (in his
1952,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"excellent Essay), so complete a praise:"
1953,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1954,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"“Read Homer once, and you can read no more;"
1955,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"For all books else appear so mean, so poor,"
1956,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Verse will seem prose: but still persist to read,"
1957,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,And Homer will be all the books you need.”
1958,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1959,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1960,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,That the Earl of Halifax was one of the first to favour me; of whom it
1961,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,is hard to say whether the advancement of the polite arts is more owing
1962,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,to his generosity or his example: that such a genius as my Lord
1963,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"Bolingbroke, not more distinguished in the great scenes of business,"
1964,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"than in all the useful and entertaining parts of learning, has not"
1965,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"refused to be the critic of these sheets, and the patron of their"

1967,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"continued his partiality to me, from my writing pastorals to my"
1968,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"attempting the Iliad. I cannot deny myself the pride of confessing,"
1969,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,that I have had the advantage not only of their advice for the conduct
1970,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"in general, but their correction of several particulars of this"
1971,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,translation.
1972,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1973,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,I could say a great deal of the pleasure of being distinguished by the
1974,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,Earl of Carnarvon; but it is almost absurd to particularize any one
1975,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,generous action in a person whose whole life is a continued series of
1976,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"them. Mr. Stanhope, the present secretary of state, will pardon my"
1977,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,desire of having it known that he was pleased to promote this affair.
1978,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,The particular zeal of Mr. Harcourt (the son of the late Lord
1979,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,Chancellor) gave me a proof how much I am honoured in a share of his
1980,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,friendship. I must attribute to the same motive that of several others
1981,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,of my friends: to whom all acknowledgments are rendered unnecessary by
1982,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,the privileges of a familiar correspondence; and I am satisfied I can
1983,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,no way better oblige men of their turn than by my silence.
1984,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,
1985,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"In short, I have found more patrons than ever Homer wanted. He would"
1986,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,have thought himself happy to have met the same favour at Athens that
1987,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"has been shown me by its learned rival, the University of Oxford. And I"
1988,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"can hardly envy him those pompous honours he received after death, when"
1989,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"I reflect on the enjoyment of so many agreeable obligations, and easy"
1990,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"friendships, which make the satisfaction of life. This distinction is"
1991,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"the more to be acknowledged, as it is shown to one whose pen has never"
1992,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"gratified the prejudices of particular parties, or the vanities of"
1993,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,"particular men. Whatever the success may prove, I shall never repent of"
1994,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,an undertaking in which I have experienced the candour and friendship
1995,POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER,of so many persons of merit; and in which I hope to pass some of those

7523,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"descend from Olympus, joins her near the Scæan gate. They agree to put"
7524,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"off the general engagement for that day, and incite Hector to challenge"
7525,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,the Greeks to a single combat. Nine of the princes accepting the
7526,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"challenge, the lot is cast and falls upon Ajax. These heroes, after"
7527,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"several attacks, are parted by the night. The Trojans calling a"
7528,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"council, Antenor purposes the delivery of Helen to the Greeks, to which"
7529,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Paris will not consent, but offers to restore them her riches. Priam"

7533,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"erect a fortification to protect their fleet and camp, flanked with"

7538,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"The three and twentieth day ends with the duel of Hector and Ajax,"

7733,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Nor aught the warrior’s thundering mace avail’d.
7734,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Supine he fell: those arms which Mars before
7735,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Had given the vanquish’d, now the victor bore:"
7736,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"But when old age had dimm’d Lycurgus’ eyes,"
7737,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,To Ereuthalion he consign’d the prize.
7738,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Furious with this he crush’d our levell’d bands,"
7739,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,And dared the trial of the strongest hands;
7740,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Nor could the strongest hands his fury stay:
7741,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"All saw, and fear’d, his huge tempestuous sway"
7742,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Till I, the youngest of the host, appear’d,"
7743,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"And, youngest, met whom all our army fear’d."
7744,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,I fought the chief: my arms Minerva crown’d:
7745,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Prone fell the giant o’er a length of ground.
7746,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"What then I was, O were your Nestor now!"
7747,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Not Hector’s self should want an equal foe.
7748,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"But, warriors, you that youthful vigour boast,"
7749,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"The flower of Greece, the examples of our host,"
7750,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Sprung from such fathers, who such numbers sway,"
7751,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Can you stand trembling, and desert the day?”"
7752,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,
7753,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,His warm reproofs the listening kings inflame;
7754,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"And nine, the noblest of the Grecian name,"
7755,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Up-started fierce: but far before the rest
7756,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,The king of men advanced his dauntless breast:
7757,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Then bold Tydides, great in arms, appear’d;"
7758,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,And next his bulk gigantic Ajax rear’d;
7759,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Oïleus follow’d; Idomen was there,[180]"
7760,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"And Merion, dreadful as the god of war:"
7761,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"With these Eurypylus and Thoas stand,"
7762,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,And wise Ulysses closed the daring band.
7763,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"All these, alike inspired with noble rage,"
7764,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Demand the fight. To whom the Pylian sage:
7765,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,
7766,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"“Lest thirst of glory your brave souls divide,"
7767,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"What chief shall combat, let the gods decide."
7768,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Whom heaven shall choose, be his the chance to raise"
7769,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"His country’s fame, his own immortal praise.”"
7770,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,
7771,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"The lots produced, each hero signs his own:"
7772,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Then in the general’s helm the fates are thrown,[181]"
7773,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"The people pray, with lifted eyes and hands,"
7774,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,And vows like these ascend from all the bands:
7775,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"“Grant, thou Almighty! in whose hand is fate,"
7776,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,A worthy champion for the Grecian state:
7777,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"This task let Ajax or Tydides prove,"
7778,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Or he, the king of kings, beloved by Jove.”"
7779,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Old Nestor shook the casque. By heaven inspired,"
7780,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Leap’d forth the lot, of every Greek desired."
7781,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"This from the right to left the herald bears,"
7782,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Held out in order to the Grecian peers;
7783,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Each to his rival yields the mark unknown,"
7784,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Till godlike Ajax finds the lot his own;
7785,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Surveys the inscription with rejoicing eyes,"
7786,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Then casts before him, and with transport cries:"
7787,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,
7788,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"“Warriors! I claim the lot, and arm with joy;"
7789,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Be mine the conquest of this chief of Troy.
7790,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Now while my brightest arms my limbs invest,"
7791,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,To Saturn’s son be all your vows address’d:
7792,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"But pray in secret, lest the foes should hear,"
7793,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,And deem your prayers the mean effect of fear.
7794,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Said I in secret? No, your vows declare"
7795,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"In such a voice as fills the earth and air,"
7796,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Lives there a chief whom Ajax ought to dread?
7797,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Ajax, in all the toils of battle bred!"
7798,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"From warlike Salamis I drew my birth,"
7799,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"And, born to combats, fear no force on earth.”"
7800,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,
7801,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"He said. The troops with elevated eyes,"
7802,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Implore the god whose thunder rends the skies:
7803,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"“O father of mankind, superior lord!"
7804,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,On lofty Ida’s holy hill adored:
7805,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Who in the highest heaven hast fix’d thy throne,"
7806,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Supreme of gods! unbounded and alone:
7807,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Grant thou, that Telamon may bear away"
7808,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,The praise and conquest of this doubtful day;
7809,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Or, if illustrious Hector be thy care,"
7810,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"That both may claim it, and that both may share.”"
7811,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,
7812,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Now Ajax braced his dazzling armour on;
7813,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Sheathed in bright steel the giant-warrior shone:
7814,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,He moves to combat with majestic pace;
7815,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"So stalks in arms the grisly god of Thrace,[182]"
7816,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"When Jove to punish faithless men prepares,"
7817,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"And gives whole nations to the waste of wars,"
7818,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Thus march’d the chief, tremendous as a god;"
7819,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Grimly he smiled; earth trembled as he strode:[183]
7820,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"His massy javelin quivering in his hand,"
7821,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"He stood, the bulwark of the Grecian band."
7822,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Through every Argive heart new transport ran;
7823,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,All Troy stood trembling at the mighty man:
7824,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Even Hector paused; and with new doubt oppress’d,"
7825,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Felt his great heart suspended in his breast:
7826,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"’Twas vain to seek retreat, and vain to fear;"
7827,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Himself had challenged, and the foe drew near."
7828,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,
7829,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Stern Telamon behind his ample shield,"
7830,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"As from a brazen tower, o’erlook’d the field."
7831,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Huge was its orb, with seven thick folds o’ercast,"
7832,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Of tough bull-hides; of solid brass the last,"
7833,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"(The work of Tychius, who in Hylè dwell’d"
7834,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"And in all arts of armoury excell’d,)"
7835,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"This Ajax bore before his manly breast,"
7836,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"And, threatening, thus his adverse chief address’d:"
7837,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,
7838,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"“Hector! approach my arm, and singly know"
7839,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"What strength thou hast, and what the Grecian foe."
7840,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Achilles shuns the fight; yet some there are,"
7841,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Not void of soul, and not unskill’d in war:"
7842,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Let him, unactive on the sea-beat shore,"
7843,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Indulge his wrath, and aid our arms no more;"
7844,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Whole troops of heroes Greece has yet to boast,"
7845,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"And sends thee one, a sample of her host,"
7846,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Such as I am, I come to prove thy might;"
7847,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"No more—be sudden, and begin the fight.”"
7848,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,
7849,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"“O son of Telamon, thy country’s pride!"
7850,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,(To Ajax thus the Trojan prince replied)
7851,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Me, as a boy, or woman, wouldst thou fright,"
7852,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"New to the field, and trembling at the fight?"
7853,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Thou meet’st a chief deserving of thy arms,"
7854,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"To combat born, and bred amidst alarms:"
7855,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"I know to shift my ground, remount the car,"

7857,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"To right, to left, the dexterous lance I wield,"
7858,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,And bear thick battle on my sounding shield/
7859,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"But open be our fight, and bold each blow;"
7860,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,I steal no conquest from a noble foe.”
7861,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,
7862,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"He said, and rising, high above the field"
7863,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Whirl’d the long lance against the sevenfold shield.
7864,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Full on the brass descending from above
7865,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Through six bull-hides the furious weapon drove,"
7866,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Till in the seventh it fix’d. Then Ajax threw;
7867,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Through Hector’s shield the forceful javelin flew,"
7868,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"His corslet enters, and his garment rends,"
7869,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"And glancing downwards, near his flank descends."
7870,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"The wary Trojan shrinks, and bending low"
7871,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Beneath his buckler, disappoints the blow."
7872,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"From their bored shields the chiefs their javelins drew,"
7873,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Then close impetuous, and the charge renew;"
7874,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Fierce as the mountain-lions bathed in blood,"
7875,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Or foaming boars, the terror of the wood."
7876,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"At Ajax, Hector his long lance extends;"
7877,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,The blunted point against the buckler bends;
7878,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"But Ajax, watchful as his foe drew near,"
7879,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Drove through the Trojan targe the knotty spear;
7880,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"It reach’d his neck, with matchless strength impell’d!"
7881,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Spouts the black gore, and dims his shining shield."
7882,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Yet ceased not Hector thus; but stooping down,"
7883,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"In his strong hand up-heaved a flinty stone,"
7884,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Black, craggy, vast: to this his force he bends;"
7885,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Full on the brazen boss the stone descends;
7886,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,The hollow brass resounded with the shock:
7887,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Then Ajax seized the fragment of a rock,"
7888,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Applied each nerve, and swinging round on high,"
7889,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"With force tempestuous, let the ruin fly;"
7890,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,The huge stone thundering through his buckler broke:
7891,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,His slacken’d knees received the numbing stroke;
7892,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Great Hector falls extended on the field,"
7893,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,His bulk supporting on the shatter’d shield:
7894,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Nor wanted heavenly aid: Apollo’s might
7895,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Confirm’d his sinews, and restored to fight."
7896,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,And now both heroes their broad falchions drew
7897,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,In flaming circles round their heads they flew;
7898,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,But then by heralds’ voice the word was given.
7899,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,The sacred ministers of earth and heaven:
7900,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Divine Talthybius, whom the Greeks employ,"
7901,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"And sage Idæus on the part of Troy,"
7902,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Between the swords their peaceful sceptres rear’d;
7903,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,And first Idæus’ awful voice was heard:
7904,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,
7905,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,
7906,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,[Illustration: ] HECTOR AND AJAX SEPARATED BY THE HERALDS

7915,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,
7916,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,To whom great Ajax his high soul express’d:

7918,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Let him, who first provoked our chiefs to fight,"

7928,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Some future day shall lengthen out the strife,"
7929,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,And let the gods decide of death or life!
7930,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Since, then, the night extends her gloomy shade,"

7936,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"But let us, on this memorable day,"

7944,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,A radiant belt that rich with purple glow’d.
7945,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Then with majestic grace they quit the plain;

7947,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,
7948,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"The Trojan bands returning Hector wait,"

7970,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"“How dear, O kings! this fatal day has cost,"
7971,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,What Greeks are perish’d! what a people lost!

7976,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Some space at least permit the war to breathe,"
7977,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"While we to flames our slaughter’d friends bequeath,"
7978,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"From the red field their scatter’d bodies bear,"

7980,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"So decent urns their snowy bones may keep,"
7981,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,And pious children o’er their ashes weep.
7982,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Here, where on one promiscuous pile they blazed,"

8001,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Let Sparta’s treasures be this hour restored,"
8002,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,And Argive Helen own her ancient lord.
8003,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"The ties of faith, the sworn alliance, broke,"
8004,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Our impious battles the just gods provoke.
8005,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"As this advice ye practise, or reject,"

8007,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,
8008,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,The senior spoke and sate. To whom replied

8013,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Thy words express the purpose of thy heart,"
8014,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Thou, in thy time, more sound advice hast given;"
8015,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"But wisdom has its date, assign’d by heaven."
8016,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Then hear me, princes of the Trojan name!"
8017,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Their treasures I’ll restore, but not the dame;"
8018,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"My treasures too, for peace, I will resign;"
8019,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,But be this bright possession ever mine.”
8020,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,
8021,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"’Twas then, the growing discord to compose,"

8025,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,
8026,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"“Ye Trojans, Dardans, and auxiliar bands!"
8027,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Now take refreshment as the hour demands;
8028,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Guard well the walls, relieve the watch of night."
8029,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Till the new sun restores the cheerful light.
8030,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Then shall our herald, to the Atrides sent,"
8031,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Before their ships proclaim my son’s intent.
8032,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Next let a truce be ask’d, that Troy may burn"
8033,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Her slaughter’d heroes, and their bones inurn;"
8034,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"That done, once more the fate of war be tried,"
8035,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"And whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide!”"
8036,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,
8037,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,The monarch spoke: the warriors snatch’d with haste
8038,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,(Each at his post in arms) a short repast.
8039,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Soon as the rosy morn had waked the day,"
8040,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,To the black ships Idæus bent his way;
8041,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"There, to the sons of Mars, in council found,"
8042,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,He raised his voice: the host stood listening round.
8043,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,
8044,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"“Ye sons of Atreus, and ye Greeks, give ear!"
8045,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"The words of Troy, and Troy’s great monarch, hear."
8046,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Pleased may ye hear (so heaven succeed my prayers)
8047,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"What Paris, author of the war, declares."
8048,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,The spoils and treasures he to Ilion bore
8049,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,(Oh had he perish’d ere they touch’d our shore!)
8050,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,He proffers injured Greece: with large increase
8051,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Of added Trojan wealth to buy the peace.
8052,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"But to restore the beauteous bride again,"
8053,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"This Greece demands, and Troy requests in vain."
8054,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Next, O ye chiefs! we ask a truce to burn"
8055,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Our slaughter’d heroes, and their bones inurn."
8056,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"That done, once more the fate of war be tried,"

8058,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,
8059,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"The Greeks gave ear, but none the silence broke;"
8060,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"At length Tydides rose, and rising spoke:"
8061,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"“Oh, take not, friends! defrauded of your fame,"
8062,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Their proffer’d wealth, nor even the Spartan dame."
8063,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Let conquest make them ours: fate shakes their wall,"
8064,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,And Troy already totters to her fall.”
8065,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,
8066,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"The admiring chiefs, and all the Grecian name,"
8067,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,With general shouts return’d him loud acclaim.
8068,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Then thus the king of kings rejects the peace:
8069,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,“Herald! in him thou hear’st the voice of Greece

8072,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Go search your slaughtered chiefs on yonder plain,"
8073,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,And gratify the manes of the slain.
8074,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Be witness, Jove, whose thunder rolls on high!”"
8075,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"He said, and rear’d his sceptre to the sky."

8079,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"He came, and standing in the midst, explain’d"
8080,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"The peace rejected, but the truce obtain’d."
8081,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Straight to their several cares the Trojans move,"
8082,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Some search the plains, some fell the sounding grove:"
8083,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Nor less the Greeks, descending on the shore,"
8084,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Hew’d the green forests, and the bodies bore."
8085,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"And now from forth the chambers of the main,"
8086,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"To shed his sacred light on earth again,"
8087,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Arose the golden chariot of the day,"
8088,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,And tipp’d the mountains with a purple ray.
8089,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,In mingled throngs the Greek and Trojan train
8090,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Through heaps of carnage search’d the mournful plain.
8091,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Scarce could the friend his slaughter’d friend explore,"
8092,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"With dust dishonour’d, and deformed with gore."
8093,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"The wounds they wash’d, their pious tears they shed,"
8094,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"And, laid along their cars, deplored the dead."
8095,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Sage Priam check’d their grief: with silent haste
8096,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,The bodies decent on the piles were placed:
8097,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"With melting hearts the cold remains they burn’d,"
8098,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"And, sadly slow, to sacred Troy return’d."
8099,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Nor less the Greeks their pious sorrows shed,"
8100,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,And decent on the pile dispose the dead;
8101,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,The cold remains consume with equal care;
8102,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"And slowly, sadly, to their fleet repair."
8103,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Now, ere the morn had streak’d with reddening light"
8104,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"The doubtful confines of the day and night,"
8105,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"About the dying flames the Greeks appear’d,"
8106,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,And round the pile a general tomb they rear’d.
8107,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Then, to secure the camp and naval powers,"
8108,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,They raised embattled walls with lofty towers:[186]
8109,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"From space to space were ample gates around,"
8110,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"For passing chariots, and a trench profound"
8111,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Of large extent; and deep in earth below,"
8112,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Strong piles infix’d stood adverse to the foe.
8113,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,
8114,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"So toil’d the Greeks: meanwhile the gods above,"
8115,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"In shining circle round their father Jove,"
8116,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Amazed beheld the wondrous works of man:
8117,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Then he, whose trident shakes the earth, began:"
8118,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,
8119,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"“What mortals henceforth shall our power adore,"
8120,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Our fanes frequent, our oracles implore,"
8121,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,If the proud Grecians thus successful boast
8122,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Their rising bulwarks on the sea-beat coast?
8123,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"See the long walls extending to the main,"
8124,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"No god consulted, and no victim slain!"
8125,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Their fame shall fill the world’s remotest ends,"
8126,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Wide as the morn her golden beam extends;
8127,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"While old Laomedon’s divine abodes,"
8128,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Those radiant structures raised by labouring gods,"
8129,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Shall, razed and lost, in long oblivion sleep.”"
8130,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Thus spoke the hoary monarch of the deep.
8131,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,
8132,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"The almighty Thunderer with a frown replies,"
8133,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"That clouds the world, and blackens half the skies:"
8134,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"“Strong god of ocean! thou, whose rage can make"
8135,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,The solid earth’s eternal basis shake!
8136,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,What cause of fear from mortal works could move[187]
8137,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,The meanest subject of our realms above?
8138,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Where’er the sun’s refulgent rays are cast,"
8139,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Thy power is honour’d, and thy fame shall last."
8140,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"But yon proud work no future age shall view,"
8141,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,No trace remain where once the glory grew.
8142,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"The sapp’d foundations by thy force shall fall,"
8143,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"And, whelm’d beneath the waves, drop the huge wall:"
8144,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Vast drifts of sand shall change the former shore:

8146,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,
8147,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Thus they in heaven: while, o’er the Grecian train,"
8148,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,The rolling sun descending to the main
8149,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Beheld the finish’d work. Their bulls they slew;
8150,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Back from the tents the savoury vapour flew.
8151,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"And now the fleet, arrived from Lemnos’ strands,"
8152,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,With Bacchus’ blessings cheered the generous bands.
8153,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Of fragrant wines the rich Eunaeus sent
8154,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,A thousant measures to the royal tent.
8155,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"(Eunaeus, whom Hypsipyle of yore"

8157,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"The rest they purchased at their proper cost,"
8158,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,And well the plenteous freight supplied the host:
8159,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Each, in exchange, proportion’d treasures gave;[188]"
8160,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Some, brass or iron; some, an ox, or slave."

8163,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"But Jove averse the signs of wrath display’d,"
8164,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,And shot red lightnings through the gloomy shade:
8165,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,"Humbled they stood; pale horror seized on all,"
8166,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,While the deep thunder shook the aerial hall.
8167,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,Each pour’d to Jove before the bowl was crown’d;
8168,THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.,And large libations drench’d the thirsty ground:

8986,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Nestor further prevails upon him to send ambassadors to Achilles, in"
8987,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,order to move him to a reconciliation. Ulysses and Ajax are made choice

9690,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,And mutual deaths were dealt with mutual chance.
9691,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"The silver Cynthia bade contention rise,"
9692,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,In vengeance of neglected sacrifice;
9693,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"On Œneus fields she sent a monstrous boar,"
9694,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"That levell’d harvests, and whole forests tore:"
9695,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,This beast (when many a chief his tusks had slain)
9696,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Great Meleager stretch’d along the plain,"
9697,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Then, for his spoils, a new debate arose,"
9698,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,The neighbour nations thence commencing foes.
9699,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Strong as they were, the bold Curetes fail’d,"

9701,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,Till rage at length inflamed his lofty breast
9702,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,(For rage invades the wisest and the best).

9714,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"To her the chief retired from stern debate,"
9715,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,But found no peace from fierce Althaea’s hate:
9716,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Althaea’s hate the unhappy warrior drew,"
9717,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,Whose luckless hand his royal uncle slew;
9718,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"She beat the ground, and call’d the powers beneath"

9751,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Thy friend, believe me, no such gifts demands,"
9752,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,And asks no honours from a mortal’s hands;

9754,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"His pleasure guides me, and his will confines;"
9755,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,And here I stay (if such his high behest)
9756,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,While life’s warm spirit beats within my breast.
9757,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Yet hear one word, and lodge it in thy heart:"
9758,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,No more molest me on Atrides’ part:
9759,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Is it for him these tears are taught to flow,"

9761,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"A generous friendship no cold medium knows,"

9763,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,One should our interests and our passions be;
9764,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,My friend must hate the man that injures me.
9765,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Do this, my Phœnix, ’tis a generous part;"
9766,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"And share my realms, my honours, and my heart."
9767,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Let these return: our voyage, or our stay,"
9768,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,Rest undetermined till the dawning day.”
9769,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
9770,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,He ceased; then order’d for the sage’s bed
9771,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,A warmer couch with numerous carpets spread.
9772,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"With that, stern Ajax his long silence broke,"
9773,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"And thus, impatient, to Ulysses spoke:"
9774,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
9775,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,“Hence let us go—why waste we time in vain?
9776,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,See what effect our low submissions gain!

9788,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,And cursed thee with a mind that cannot yield.
9789,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,One woman-slave was ravish’d from thy arms:
9790,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Lo, seven are offer’d, and of equal charms."
9791,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Then hear, Achilles! be of better mind;"
9792,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Revere thy roof, and to thy guests be kind;"

9803,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,The glorious combat is no more my care;
9804,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Not till, amidst yon sinking navy slain,"
9805,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,The blood of Greeks shall dye the sable main;
9806,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Not till the flames, by Hector’s fury thrown,"
9807,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Consume your vessels, and approach my own;"

9810,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
9811,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"This said, each prince a double goblet crown’d,"
9812,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,And cast a large libation on the ground;
9813,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Then to their vessels, through the gloomy shades,"
9814,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,The chiefs return; divine Ulysses leads.
9815,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Meantime Achilles’ slaves prepared a bed,"
9816,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"With fleeces, carpets, and soft linen spread:"
9817,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"There, till the sacred morn restored the day,"
9818,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,In slumber sweet the reverend Phœnix lay.
9819,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"But in his inner tent, an ampler space,"
9820,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,Achilles slept; and in his warm embrace
9821,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,Fair Diomede of the Lesbian race.
9822,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Last, for Patroclus was the couch prepared,"
9823,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,Whose nightly joys the beauteous Iphis shared;
9824,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,Achilles to his friend consign’d her charms
9825,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,When Scyros fell before his conquering arms.
9826,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
9827,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"And now the elected chiefs whom Greece had sent,"
9828,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Pass’d through the hosts, and reach’d the royal tent."
9829,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Then rising all, with goblets in their hands,"
9830,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,The peers and leaders of the Achaian bands
9831,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,Hail’d their return: Atrides first begun:

9833,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,“Say what success? divine Laertes’ son!
9834,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,Achilles’ high resolves declare to all:
9835,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Returns the chief, or must our navy fall?”"
9836,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
9837,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,“Great king of nations! (Ithacus replied)
9838,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Fix’d is his wrath, unconquer’d is his pride;"
9839,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"He slights thy friendship, thy proposals scorns,"
9840,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"And, thus implored, with fiercer fury burns."
9841,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"To save our army, and our fleets to free,"
9842,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,Is not his care; but left to Greece and thee.
9843,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Your eyes shall view, when morning paints the sky,"
9844,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,Beneath his oars the whitening billows fly;
9845,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Us too he bids our oars and sails employ,"
9846,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,Nor hope the fall of heaven-protected Troy;
9847,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"For Jove o’ershades her with his arm divine,"
9848,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Inspires her war, and bids her glory shine."
9849,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Such was his word: what further he declared,"
9850,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,These sacred heralds and great Ajax heard.
9851,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"But Phœnix in his tent the chief retains,"
9852,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,Safe to transport him to his native plains
9853,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"When morning dawns; if other he decree,"
9854,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"His age is sacred, and his choice is free.”"
9855,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
9856,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Ulysses ceased: the great Achaian host,"
9857,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"With sorrow seized, in consternation lost,"
9858,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,Attend the stern reply. Tydides broke
9859,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"The general silence, and undaunted spoke."
9860,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"“Why should we gifts to proud Achilles send,"
9861,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,Or strive with prayers his haughty soul to bend?
9862,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"His country’s woes he glories to deride,"
9863,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,And prayers will burst that swelling heart with pride.
9864,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Be the fierce impulse of his rage obey’d,"
9865,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,Our battles let him or desert or aid;
9866,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,Then let him arm when Jove or he think fit:
9867,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"That, to his madness, or to Heaven commit:"
9868,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"What for ourselves we can, is always ours;"

9878,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,
9879,THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.,"Shouts of acclaim the listening heroes raise,"

15402,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Let Greece, redeem’d from this destructive strait,"

15411,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Great Jove with conquest crown’d the Trojan band.
15412,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Ajax no more the sounding storm sustain’d,"

15414,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",On his tired arm the weighty buckler hung;
15415,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",His hollow helm with falling javelins rung;
15416,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","His breath, in quick short pantings, comes and goes;"
15417,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",And painful sweat from all his members flows.
15418,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Spent and o’erpower’d, he barely breathes at most;"

15420,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Dangers on dangers all around him glow,"

15428,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Full on the lance a stroke so justly sped,"
15429,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",That the broad falchion lopp’d its brazen head;
15430,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",His pointless spear the warrior shakes in vain;
15431,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",The brazen head falls sounding on the plain.
15432,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Great Ajax saw, and own’d the hand divine;"
15433,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Confessing Jove, and trembling at the sign,"
15434,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Warn’d he retreats. Then swift from all sides pour

15447,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",
15448,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",He cased his limbs in brass; and first around

15651,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Close to the stern of that famed ship which bore
15652,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Unbless’d Protesilaus to Ilion’s shore,"
15653,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","The great Pæonian, bold Pyrechmes stood;"
15654,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",(Who led his bands from Axius’ winding flood;)
15655,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",His shoulder-blade receives the fatal wound;
15656,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",The groaning warrior pants upon the ground.
15657,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","His troops, that see their country’s glory slain,"
15658,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Fly diverse, scatter’d o’er the distant plain."
15659,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Patroclus’ arm forbids the spreading fires,"
15660,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",And from the half-burn’d ship proud Troy retires;
15661,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Clear’d from the smoke the joyful navy lies;
15662,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",In heaps on heaps the foe tumultuous flies;
15663,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Triumphant Greece her rescued decks ascends,"
15664,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",And loud acclaim the starry region rends.
15665,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","So when thick clouds enwrap the mountain’s head,"
15666,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",O’er heaven’s expanse like one black ceiling spread;
15667,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Sudden the Thunderer, with a flashing ray,"
15668,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Bursts through the darkness, and lets down the day:"
15669,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","The hills shine out, the rocks in prospect rise,"
15670,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","And streams, and vales, and forests, strike the eyes;"
15671,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","The smiling scene wide opens to the sight,"
15672,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",And all the unmeasured ether flames with light.
15673,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",
15674,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","But Troy repulsed, and scatter’d o’er the plains,"
15675,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Forced from the navy, yet the fight maintains."
15676,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Now every Greek some hostile hero slew,"
15677,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","But still the foremost, bold Patroclus flew:"
15678,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","As Areilycus had turn’d him round,"
15679,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Sharp in his thigh he felt the piercing wound;
15680,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","The brazen-pointed spear, with vigour thrown,"
15681,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","The thigh transfix’d, and broke the brittle bone:"
15682,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Headlong he fell. Next, Thoas was thy chance;"
15683,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Thy breast, unarm’d, received the Spartan lance."
15684,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Phylides’ dart (as Amphidus drew nigh)
15685,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","His blow prevented, and transpierced his thigh,"
15686,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Tore all the brawn, and rent the nerves away;"
15687,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","In darkness, and in death, the warrior lay."
15688,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",
15689,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","In equal arms two sons of Nestor stand,"
15690,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",And two bold brothers of the Lycian band:
15691,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","By great Antilochus, Atymnius dies,"
15692,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Pierced in the flank, lamented youth! he lies,"
15693,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Kind Maris, bleeding in his brother’s wound,"
15694,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Defends the breathless carcase on the ground;
15695,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Furious he flies, his murderer to engage:"
15696,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","But godlike Thrasimed prevents his rage,"
15697,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Between his arm and shoulder aims a blow;
15698,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",His arm falls spouting on the dust below:
15699,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","He sinks, with endless darkness cover’d o’er:"
15700,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","And vents his soul, effused with gushing gore."
15701,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",
15702,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Slain by two brothers, thus two brothers bleed,"
15703,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Sarpedon’s friends, Amisodarus’ seed;"
15704,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Amisodarus, who, by Furies led,"
15705,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","The bane of men, abhorr’d Chimaera bred;"
15706,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Skill’d in the dart in vain, his sons expire,"
15707,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",And pay the forfeit of their guilty sire.
15708,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",
15709,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Stopp’d in the tumult Cleobulus lies,"
15710,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Beneath Oïleus’ arm, a living prize;"
15711,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",A living prize not long the Trojan stood;
15712,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",The thirsty falchion drank his reeking blood:
15713,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Plunged in his throat the smoking weapon lies;
15714,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Black death, and fate unpitying, seal his eyes."
15715,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",
15716,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Amid the ranks, with mutual thirst of fame,"
15717,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Lycon the brave, and fierce Peneleus came;"
15718,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","In vain their javelins at each other flew,"
15719,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Now, met in arms, their eager swords they drew."
15720,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",On the plumed crest of his Bœotian foe
15721,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",The daring Lycon aim’d a noble blow;
15722,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","The sword broke short; but his, Peneleus sped"
15723,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Full on the juncture of the neck and head:
15724,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","The head, divided by a stroke so just,"
15725,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Hung by the skin; the body sunk to dust.
15726,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",
15727,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","O’ertaken Neamas by Merion bleeds,"
15728,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Pierced through the shoulder as he mounts his steeds;
15729,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Back from the car he tumbles to the ground:
15730,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",His swimming eyes eternal shades surround.
15731,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",
15732,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Next Erymas was doom’d his fate to feel,"
15733,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",His open’d mouth received the Cretan steel:
15734,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Beneath the brain the point a passage tore,"
15735,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Crash’d the thin bones, and drown’d the teeth in gore:"
15736,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","His mouth, his eyes, his nostrils, pour a flood;"
15737,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",He sobs his soul out in the gush of blood.
15738,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",
15739,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","As when the flocks neglected by the swain,"
15740,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Or kids, or lambs, lie scatter’d o’er the plain,"
15741,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","A troop of wolves the unguarded charge survey,"
15742,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","And rend the trembling, unresisting prey:"
15743,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Thus on the foe the Greeks impetuous came;
15744,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Troy fled, unmindful of her former fame."
15745,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",
15746,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","But still at Hector godlike Ajax aim’d,"
15747,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Still, pointed at his breast, his javelin flamed."
15748,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","The Trojan chief, experienced in the field,"
15749,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","O’er his broad shoulders spread the massy shield,"
15750,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Observed the storm of darts the Grecians pour,"
15751,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",And on his buckler caught the ringing shower:
15752,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","He sees for Greece the scale of conquest rise,"
15753,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Yet stops, and turns, and saves his loved allies."
15754,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",
15755,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","As when the hand of Jove a tempest forms,"
15756,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","And rolls the cloud to blacken heaven with storms,"
15757,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Dark o’er the fields the ascending vapour flies,"
15758,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","And shades the sun, and blots the golden skies:"
15759,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","So from the ships, along the dusky plain,"
15760,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Dire Flight and Terror drove the Trojan train.
15761,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Even Hector fled; through heads of disarray
15762,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",The fiery coursers forced their lord away:
15763,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",While far behind his Trojans fall confused;
15764,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Wedged in the trench, in one vast carnage bruised:"
15765,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Chariots on chariots roll: the clashing spokes
15766,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Shock; while the madding steeds break short their yokes.
15767,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",In vain they labour up the steepy mound;
15768,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Their charioteers lie foaming on the ground.
15769,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Fierce on the rear, with shouts Patroclus flies;"
15770,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Tumultuous clamour fills the fields and skies;
15771,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Thick drifts of dust involve their rapid flight;
15772,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Clouds rise on clouds, and heaven is snatch’d from sight."
15773,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","The affrighted steeds their dying lords cast down,"
15774,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Scour o’er the fields, and stretch to reach the town."
15775,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Loud o’er the rout was heard the victor’s cry,"
15776,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Where the war bleeds, and where the thickest die,"
15777,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Where horse and arms, and chariots lie o’erthrown,"
15778,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",And bleeding heroes under axles groan.
15779,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","No stop, no check, the steeds of Peleus knew:"
15780,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",From bank to bank the immortal coursers flew.
15781,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","High-bounding o’er the fosse, the whirling car"
15782,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Smokes through the ranks, o’ertakes the flying war,"
15783,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","And thunders after Hector; Hector flies,"
15784,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Patroclus shakes his lance; but fate denies.
15785,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Not with less noise, with less impetuous force,"
15786,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","The tide of Trojans urge their desperate course,"
15787,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Than when in autumn Jove his fury pours,"
15788,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",And earth is loaden with incessant showers;
15789,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","(When guilty mortals break the eternal laws,"
15790,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Or judges, bribed, betray the righteous cause;)"
15791,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","From their deep beds he bids the rivers rise,"
15792,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",And opens all the flood-gates of the skies:
15793,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","The impetuous torrents from their hills obey,"
15794,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Whole fields are drown’d, and mountains swept away;"
15795,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Loud roars the deluge till it meets the main;
15796,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",And trembling man sees all his labours vain!
15797,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",
15798,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",And now the chief (the foremost troops repell’d)
15799,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Back to the ships his destined progress held,"
15800,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Bore down half Troy in his resistless way,"
15801,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",And forced the routed ranks to stand the day.
15802,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Between the space where silver Simois flows,"
15803,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Where lay the fleets, and where the rampires rose,"
15804,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","All grim in dust and blood Patroclus stands,"
15805,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",And turns the slaughter on the conquering bands.
15806,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","First Pronous died beneath his fiery dart,"
15807,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Which pierced below the shield his valiant heart.
15808,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Thestor was next, who saw the chief appear,"
15809,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",And fell the victim of his coward fear;
15810,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Shrunk up he sat, with wild and haggard eye,"
15811,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Nor stood to combat, nor had force to fly;"
15812,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Patroclus mark’d him as he shunn’d the war,"
15813,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","And with unmanly tremblings shook the car,"
15814,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","And dropp’d the flowing reins. Him ’twixt the jaws,"
15815,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","The javelin sticks, and from the chariot draws."
15816,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","As on a rock that overhangs the main,"
15817,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","An angler, studious of the line and cane,"
15818,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Some mighty fish draws panting to the shore:
15819,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Not with less ease the barbed javelin bore
15820,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","The gaping dastard; as the spear was shook,"
15821,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","He fell, and life his heartless breast forsook."
15822,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",
15823,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Next on Eryalus he flies; a stone,"
15824,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Large as a rock, was by his fury thrown:"
15825,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Full on his crown the ponderous fragment flew,"
15826,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","And burst the helm, and cleft the head in two:"
15827,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Prone to the ground the breathless warrior fell,"
15828,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",And death involved him with the shades of hell.
15829,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Then low in dust Epaltes, Echius, lie;"
15830,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Ipheas, Evippus, Polymelus, die;"
15831,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Amphoterus and Erymas succeed;
15832,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",And last Tlepolemus and Pyres bleed.
15833,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Where’er he moves, the growing slaughters spread"
15834,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",In heaps on heaps a monument of dead.
15835,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",
15836,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",When now Sarpedon his brave friends beheld
15837,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Grovelling in dust, and gasping on the field,"
15838,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",With this reproach his flying host he warms:
15839,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",“Oh stain to honour! oh disgrace to arms!
15840,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Forsake, inglorious, the contended plain;"
15841,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",This hand unaided shall the war sustain:
15842,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","The task be mine this hero’s strength to try,"
15843,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Who mows whole troops, and makes an army fly.”"
15844,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",
15845,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","He spake: and, speaking, leaps from off the car:"
15846,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Patroclus lights, and sternly waits the war."
15847,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",As when two vultures on the mountain’s height
15848,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Stoop with resounding pinions to the fight;
15849,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","They cuff, they tear, they raise a screaming cry;"
15850,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","The desert echoes, and the rocks reply:"
15851,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","The warriors thus opposed in arms, engage"
15852,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","With equal clamours, and with equal rage."
15853,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",
15854,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Jove view’d the combat: whose event foreseen,"
15855,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",He thus bespoke his sister and his queen:
15856,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","“The hour draws on; the destinies ordain,[245]"
15857,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",My godlike son shall press the Phrygian plain:
15858,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Already on the verge of death he stands,"
15859,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","His life is owed to fierce Patroclus’ hands,"
15860,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",What passions in a parent’s breast debate!
15861,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Say, shall I snatch him from impending fate,"
15862,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","And send him safe to Lycia, distant far"
15863,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",From all the dangers and the toils of war;
15864,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Or to his doom my bravest offspring yield,"
15865,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","And fatten, with celestial blood, the field?”"
15866,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",
15867,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Then thus the goddess with the radiant eyes:
15868,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","“What words are these, O sovereign of the skies!"
15869,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Short is the date prescribed to mortal man;
15870,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Shall Jove for one extend the narrow span,"
15871,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Whose bounds were fix’d before his race began?
15872,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","How many sons of gods, foredoom’d to death,"
15873,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Before proud Ilion must resign their breath!
15874,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Were thine exempt, debate would rise above,"
15875,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",And murmuring powers condemn their partial Jove.
15876,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Give the bold chief a glorious fate in fight;
15877,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","And when the ascending soul has wing’d her flight,"
15878,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Let Sleep and Death convey, by thy command,"
15879,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",The breathless body to his native land.
15880,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","His friends and people, to his future praise,"
15881,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","A marble tomb and pyramid shall raise,"
15882,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",And lasting honours to his ashes give;
15883,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",His fame (’tis all the dead can have) shall live.”
15884,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",
15885,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","She said: the cloud-compeller, overcome,"
15886,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Assents to fate, and ratifies the doom."
15887,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Then touch’d with grief, the weeping heavens distill’d"
15888,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",A shower of blood o’er all the fatal field:
15889,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","The god, his eyes averting from the plain,"
15890,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Laments his son, predestined to be slain,"
15891,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Far from the Lycian shores, his happy native reign."
15892,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Now met in arms, the combatants appear;"
15893,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Each heaved the shield, and poised the lifted spear;"
15894,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","From strong Patroclus’ hand the javelin fled,"
15895,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",And pass’d the groin of valiant Thrasymed;
15896,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","The nerves unbraced no more his bulk sustain,"
15897,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","He falls, and falling bites the bloody plain."
15898,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Two sounding darts the Lycian leader threw:
15899,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","The first aloof with erring fury flew,"
15900,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","The next transpierced Achilles’ mortal steed,"
15901,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",The generous Pedasus of Theban breed:
15902,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Fix’d in the shoulder’s joint, he reel’d around,"
15903,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Roll’d in the bloody dust, and paw’d the slippery ground."
15904,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",His sudden fall the entangled harness broke;
15905,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Each axle crackled, and the chariot shook:"
15906,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","When bold Automedon, to disengage"
15907,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","The starting coursers, and restrain their rage,"
15908,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Divides the traces with his sword, and freed"
15909,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",The encumbered chariot from the dying steed:
15910,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","The rest move on, obedient to the rein:"
15911,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",The car rolls slowly o’er the dusty plain.
15912,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",
15913,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",The towering chiefs to fiercer fight advance:
15914,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","And first Sarpedon whirl’d his weighty lance,"
15915,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Which o’er the warrior’s shoulder took its course,"
15916,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",And spent in empty air its dying force.
15917,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Not so Patroclus’ never-erring dart;
15918,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Aim’d at his breast it pierced a mortal part,"
15919,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Where the strong fibres bind the solid heart.
15920,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Then as the mountain oak, or poplar tall,"
15921,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Or pine (fit mast for some great admiral)
15922,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Nods to the axe, till with a groaning sound"
15923,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","It sinks, and spreads its honours on the ground,"
15924,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Thus fell the king; and laid on earth supine,"
15925,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Before his chariot stretch’d his form divine:
15926,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","He grasp’d the dust distain’d with streaming gore,"
15927,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","And, pale in death, lay groaning on the shore."
15928,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","So lies a bull beneath the lion’s paws,"
15929,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",While the grim savage grinds with foamy jaws
15930,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","The trembling limbs, and sucks the smoking blood;"
15931,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Deep groans, and hollow roars, rebellow through the wood."
15932,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",
15933,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Then to the leader of the Lycian band
15934,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",The dying chief address’d his last command;
15935,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","“Glaucus, be bold; thy task be first to dare"
15936,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","The glorious dangers of destructive war,"
15937,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","To lead my troops, to combat at their head,"
15938,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Incite the living, and supply the dead."
15939,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Tell them, I charged them with my latest breath"
15940,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Not unrevenged to bear Sarpedon’s death.
15941,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","What grief, what shame, must Glaucus undergo,"
15942,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",If these spoil’d arms adorn a Grecian foe!
15943,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Then as a friend, and as a warrior fight;"
15944,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Defend my body, conquer in my right:"
15945,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","That, taught by great examples, all may try"
15946,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Like thee to vanquish, or like me to die.”"
15947,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","He ceased; the Fates suppress’d his labouring breath,"
15948,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",And his eyes darken’d with the shades of death.
15949,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",The insulting victor with disdain bestrode
15950,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","The prostrate prince, and on his bosom trod;"
15951,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Then drew the weapon from his panting heart,"
15952,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",The reeking fibres clinging to the dart;
15953,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","From the wide wound gush’d out a stream of blood,"
15954,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",And the soul issued in the purple flood.
15955,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","His flying steeds the Myrmidons detain,"
15956,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Unguided now, their mighty master slain."
15957,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","All-impotent of aid, transfix’d with grief,"
15958,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Unhappy Glaucus heard the dying chief:
15959,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","His painful arm, yet useless with the smart"
15960,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Inflicted late by Teucer’s deadly dart,"
15961,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Supported on his better hand he stay’d:
15962,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",To Phœbus then (’twas all he could) he pray’d:
15963,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",
15964,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","“All-seeing monarch! whether Lycia’s coast,"
15965,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Or sacred Ilion, thy bright presence boast,"
15966,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Powerful alike to ease the wretch’s smart;
15967,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",O hear me! god of every healing art!
15968,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Lo! stiff with clotted blood, and pierced with pain,"
15969,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","That thrills my arm, and shoots through every vein,"
15970,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","I stand unable to sustain the spear,"
15971,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","And sigh, at distance from the glorious war."
15972,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Low in the dust is great Sarpedon laid,"
15973,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Nor Jove vouchsafed his hapless offspring aid;
15974,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","But thou, O god of health! thy succour lend,"
15975,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",To guard the relics of my slaughter’d friend:
15976,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","For thou, though distant, canst restore my might,"
15977,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","To head my Lycians, and support the fight.”"
15978,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",
15979,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Apollo heard; and, suppliant as he stood,"
15980,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",His heavenly hand restrain’d the flux of blood;
15981,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","He drew the dolours from the wounded part,"
15982,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",And breathed a spirit in his rising heart.
15983,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Renew’d by art divine, the hero stands,"
15984,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",And owns the assistance of immortal hands.
15985,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","First to the fight his native troops he warms,"
15986,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Then loudly calls on Troy’s vindictive arms;
15987,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",With ample strides he stalks from place to place;
15988,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Now fires Agenor, now Polydamas:"
15989,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Æneas next, and Hector he accosts;"
15990,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Inflaming thus the rage of all their hosts.
15991,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",
15992,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","“What thoughts, regardless chief! thy breast employ?"
15993,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Oh too forgetful of the friends of Troy!
15994,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Those generous friends, who, from their country far,"
15995,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Breathe their brave souls out in another’s war.
15996,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","See! where in dust the great Sarpedon lies,"
15997,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","In action valiant, and in council wise,"
15998,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Who guarded right, and kept his people free;"
15999,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","To all his Lycians lost, and lost to thee!"
16000,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Stretch’d by Patroclus’ arm on yonder plains,"
16001,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",O save from hostile rage his loved remains!
16002,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Ah let not Greece his conquer’d trophies boast,"
16003,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Nor on his corse revenge her heroes lost!”
16004,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",
16005,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",He spoke: each leader in his grief partook:
16006,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Troy, at the loss, through all her legions shook."
16007,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Transfix’d with deep regret, they view o’erthrown"
16008,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","At once his country’s pillar, and their own;"
16009,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","A chief, who led to Troy’s beleaguer’d wall"
16010,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","A host of heroes, and outshined them all."
16011,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Fired, they rush on; first Hector seeks the foes,"
16012,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",And with superior vengeance greatly glows.
16013,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",
16014,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","But o’er the dead the fierce Patroclus stands,"
16015,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","And rousing Ajax, roused the listening bands:"
16016,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",
16017,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","“Heroes, be men; be what you were before;"
16018,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Or weigh the great occasion, and be more."
16019,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","The chief who taught our lofty walls to yield,"
16020,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Lies pale in death, extended on the field."
16021,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",To guard his body Troy in numbers flies;
16022,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",’Tis half the glory to maintain our prize.
16023,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Haste, strip his arms, the slaughter round him spread,"
16024,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",And send the living Lycians to the dead.”
16025,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",
16026,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",The heroes kindle at his fierce command;
16027,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",The martial squadrons close on either hand:
16028,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Here Troy and Lycia charge with loud alarms,"
16029,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Thessalia there, and Greece, oppose their arms."
16030,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",With horrid shouts they circle round the slain;
16031,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",The clash of armour rings o’er all the plain.
16032,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Great Jove, to swell the horrors of the fight,"
16033,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","O’er the fierce armies pours pernicious night,"
16034,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","And round his son confounds the warring hosts,"
16035,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",His fate ennobling with a crowd of ghosts.
16036,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",
16037,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Now Greece gives way, and great Epigeus falls;"
16038,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Agacleus’ son, from Budium’s lofty walls;"
16039,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Who chased for murder thence a suppliant came
16040,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","To Peleus, and the silver-footed dame;"
16041,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Now sent to Troy, Achilles’ arms to aid,"
16042,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",He pays due vengeance to his kinsman’s shade.
16043,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Soon as his luckless hand had touch’d the dead,"
16044,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",A rock’s large fragment thunder’d on his head;
16045,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Hurl’d by Hectorean force it cleft in twain
16046,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","His shatter’d helm, and stretch’d him o’er the slain."
16047,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",
16048,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Fierce to the van of fight Patroclus came,"
16049,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","And, like an eagle darting at his game,"
16050,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Sprung on the Trojan and the Lycian band.
16051,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","What grief thy heart, what fury urged thy hand,"
16052,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","O generous Greek! when with full vigour thrown,"
16053,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","At Sthenelaus flew the weighty stone,"
16054,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Which sunk him to the dead: when Troy, too near"
16055,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","That arm, drew back; and Hector learn’d to fear."
16056,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Far as an able hand a lance can throw,"
16057,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Or at the lists, or at the fighting foe;"
16058,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",So far the Trojans from their lines retired;
16059,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Till Glaucus, turning, all the rest inspired."
16060,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Then Bathyclaeus fell beneath his rage,"
16061,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",The only hope of Chalcon’s trembling age;
16062,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Wide o’er the land was stretch’d his large domain,"
16063,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","With stately seats, and riches blest in vain:"
16064,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Him, bold with youth, and eager to pursue"
16065,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","The flying Lycians, Glaucus met and slew;"
16066,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Pierced through the bosom with a sudden wound,"
16067,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","He fell, and falling made the fields resound."
16068,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",The Achaians sorrow for their heroes slain;
16069,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","With conquering shouts the Trojans shake the plain,"
16070,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",And crowd to spoil the dead: the Greeks oppose;
16071,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",An iron circle round the carcase grows.
16072,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",
16073,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","Then brave Laogonus resign’d his breath,"
16074,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Despatch’d by Merion to the shades of death:
16075,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","On Ida’s holy hill he made abode,"
16076,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","The priest of Jove, and honour’d like his god."
16077,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Between the jaw and ear the javelin went;
16078,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","The soul, exhaling, issued at the vent."
16079,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","His spear Æneas at the victor threw,"
16080,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Who stooping forward from the death withdrew;
16081,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","The lance hiss’d harmless o’er his covering shield,"
16082,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","And trembling struck, and rooted in the field;"
16083,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","There yet scarce spent, it quivers on the plain,"
16084,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Sent by the great Æneas’ arm in vain.
16085,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",“Swift as thou art (the raging hero cries)
16086,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","And skill’d in dancing to dispute the prize,"
16087,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS","My spear, the destined passage had it found,"
16088,"THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS",Had fix’d thy active vigour to the ground.”

16175,LYCIA,
16176,LYCIA,"Apollo bows, and from mount Ida’s height,"
16177,LYCIA,Swift to the field precipitates his flight;
16178,LYCIA,"Thence from the war the breathless hero bore,"
16179,LYCIA,"Veil’d in a cloud, to silver Simois’ shore;"
16180,LYCIA,"There bathed his honourable wounds, and dress’d"
16181,LYCIA,His manly members in the immortal vest;
16182,LYCIA,And with perfumes of sweet ambrosial dews
16183,LYCIA,"Restores his freshness, and his form renews."
16184,LYCIA,"Then Sleep and Death, two twins of winged race,"
16185,LYCIA,"Of matchless swiftness, but of silent pace,"
16186,LYCIA,"Received Sarpedon, at the god’s command,"
16187,LYCIA,And in a moment reach’d the Lycian land;
16188,LYCIA,"The corse amidst his weeping friends they laid,"
16189,LYCIA,Where endless honours wait the sacred shade.
16190,LYCIA,
16191,LYCIA,"Meanwhile Patroclus pours along the plains,"
16192,LYCIA,"With foaming coursers, and with loosen’d reins."
16193,LYCIA,"Fierce on the Trojan and the Lycian crew,"
16194,LYCIA,Ah blind to fate! thy headlong fury flew:
16195,LYCIA,"Against what fate and powerful Jove ordain,"
16196,LYCIA,"Vain was thy friend’s command, thy courage vain."
16197,LYCIA,"For he, the god, whose counsels uncontroll’d"
16198,LYCIA,"Dismay the mighty, and confound the bold;"
16199,LYCIA,"The god who gives, resumes, and orders all,"
16200,LYCIA,"He urged thee on, and urged thee on to fall."
16201,LYCIA,
16202,LYCIA,"Who first, brave hero! by that arm was slain,"
16203,LYCIA,Who last beneath thy vengeance press’d the plain;
16204,LYCIA,"When heaven itself thy fatal fury led,"
16205,LYCIA,And call’d to fill the number of the dead?
16206,LYCIA,Adrestus first; Autonous then succeeds;
16207,LYCIA,"Echeclus follows; next young Megas bleeds,"
16208,LYCIA,"Epistor, Melanippus, bite the ground;"
16209,LYCIA,"The slaughter, Elasus and Mulius crown’d:"
16210,LYCIA,Then sunk Pylartes to eternal night;
16211,LYCIA,"The rest, dispersing, trust their fates to flight."
16212,LYCIA,
16213,LYCIA,"Now Troy had stoop’d beneath his matchless power,"
16214,LYCIA,But flaming Phœbus kept the sacred tower.
16215,LYCIA,Thrice at the battlements Patroclus strook;[246]
16216,LYCIA,His blazing ægis thrice Apollo shook;
16217,LYCIA,"He tried the fourth; when, bursting from the cloud,"
16218,LYCIA,A more than mortal voice was heard aloud.
16219,LYCIA,
16220,LYCIA,“Patroclus! cease; this heaven-defended wall
16221,LYCIA,Defies thy lance; not fated yet to fall;
16222,LYCIA,"Thy friend, thy greater far, it shall withstand,"
16223,LYCIA,Troy shall not stoop even to Achilles’ hand.”
16224,LYCIA,
16225,LYCIA,So spoke the god who darts celestial fires;
16226,LYCIA,"The Greek obeys him, and with awe retires."
16227,LYCIA,"While Hector, checking at the Scæan gates"
16228,LYCIA,"His panting coursers, in his breast debates,"
16229,LYCIA,"Or in the field his forces to employ,"
16230,LYCIA,Or draw the troops within the walls of Troy.
16231,LYCIA,"Thus while he thought, beside him Phœbus stood,"
16232,LYCIA,"In Asius’ shape, who reigned by Sangar’s flood;"
16233,LYCIA,"(Thy brother, Hecuba! from Dymas sprung,"
16234,LYCIA,"A valiant warrior, haughty, bold, and young;)"
16235,LYCIA,Thus he accosts him. “What a shameful sight!
16236,LYCIA,God! is it Hector that forbears the fight?
16237,LYCIA,Were thine my vigour this successful spear
16238,LYCIA,Should soon convince thee of so false a fear.
16239,LYCIA,"Turn thee, ah turn thee to the field of fame,"
16240,LYCIA,And in Patroclus’ blood efface thy shame.
16241,LYCIA,"Perhaps Apollo shall thy arms succeed,"
16242,LYCIA,And heaven ordains him by thy lance to bleed.”
16243,LYCIA,
16244,LYCIA,"So spoke the inspiring god; then took his flight,"
16245,LYCIA,And plunged amidst the tumult of the fight.
16246,LYCIA,He bids Cebrion drive the rapid car;
16247,LYCIA,"The lash resounds, the coursers rush to war."
16248,LYCIA,"The god the Grecians’ sinking souls depress’d,"
16249,LYCIA,And pour’d swift spirits through each Trojan breast.
16250,LYCIA,"Patroclus lights, impatient for the fight;"
16251,LYCIA,"A spear his left, a stone employs his right:"
16252,LYCIA,With all his nerves he drives it at the foe.
16253,LYCIA,"Pointed above, and rough and gross below:"
16254,LYCIA,"The falling ruin crush’d Cebrion’s head,"
16255,LYCIA,The lawless offspring of king Priam’s bed;
16256,LYCIA,"His front, brows, eyes, one undistinguish’d wound:"
16257,LYCIA,The bursting balls drop sightless to the ground.
16258,LYCIA,"The charioteer, while yet he held the rein,"
16259,LYCIA,"Struck from the car, falls headlong on the plain."
16260,LYCIA,"To the dark shades the soul unwilling glides,"
16261,LYCIA,While the proud victor thus his fall derides.
16262,LYCIA,
16263,LYCIA,“Good heaven! what active feats yon artist shows!
16264,LYCIA,What skilful divers are our Phrygian foes!
16265,LYCIA,Mark with what ease they sink into the sand!
16266,LYCIA,Pity that all their practice is by land!”
16267,LYCIA,
16268,LYCIA,"Then rushing sudden on his prostrate prize,"
16269,LYCIA,To spoil the carcase fierce Patroclus flies:
16270,LYCIA,"Swift as a lion, terrible and bold,"
16271,LYCIA,"That sweeps the field, depopulates the fold;"
16272,LYCIA,"Pierced through the dauntless heart, then tumbles slain,"
16273,LYCIA,And from his fatal courage finds his bane.
16274,LYCIA,"At once bold Hector leaping from his car,"
16275,LYCIA,"Defends the body, and provokes the war."
16276,LYCIA,"Thus for some slaughter’d hind, with equal rage,"
16277,LYCIA,Two lordly rulers of the wood engage;
16278,LYCIA,"Stung with fierce hunger, each the prey invades,"
16279,LYCIA,And echoing roars rebellow through the shades.
16280,LYCIA,"Stern Hector fastens on the warrior’s head,"
16281,LYCIA,And by the foot Patroclus drags the dead:
16282,LYCIA,"While all around, confusion, rage, and fright,"
16283,LYCIA,Mix the contending hosts in mortal fight.
16284,LYCIA,"So pent by hills, the wild winds roar aloud"
16285,LYCIA,In the deep bosom of some gloomy wood;
16286,LYCIA,"Leaves, arms, and trees, aloft in air are blown,"
16287,LYCIA,"The broad oaks crackle, and the Sylvans groan;"
16288,LYCIA,"This way and that, the rattling thicket bends,"
16289,LYCIA,And the whole forest in one crash descends.
16290,LYCIA,"Not with less noise, with less tumultuous rage,"
16291,LYCIA,In dreadful shock the mingled hosts engage.
16292,LYCIA,"Darts shower’d on darts, now round the carcase ring;"
16293,LYCIA,Now flights of arrows bounding from the string:
16294,LYCIA,"Stones follow stones; some clatter on the fields,"
16295,LYCIA,"Some hard, and heavy, shake the sounding shields."
16296,LYCIA,"But where the rising whirlwind clouds the plains,"
16297,LYCIA,"Sunk in soft dust the mighty chief remains,"
16298,LYCIA,"And, stretch’d in death, forgets the guiding reins!"
16299,LYCIA,
16300,LYCIA,"Now flaming from the zenith, Sol had driven"
16301,LYCIA,His fervid orb through half the vault of heaven;
16302,LYCIA,While on each host with equal tempests fell
16303,LYCIA,"The showering darts, and numbers sank to hell."
16304,LYCIA,"But when his evening wheels o’erhung the main,"
16305,LYCIA,Glad conquest rested on the Grecian train.
16306,LYCIA,"Then from amidst the tumult and alarms,"
16307,LYCIA,They draw the conquer’d corse and radiant arms.
16308,LYCIA,"Then rash Patroclus with new fury glows,"
16309,LYCIA,"And breathing slaughter, pours amid the foes."
16310,LYCIA,"Thrice on the press like Mars himself he flew,"
16311,LYCIA,And thrice three heroes at each onset slew.
16312,LYCIA,There ends thy glory! there the Fates untwine
16313,LYCIA,"The last, black remnant of so bright a line:"
16314,LYCIA,Apollo dreadful stops thy middle way;
16315,LYCIA,"Death calls, and heaven allows no longer day!"
16316,LYCIA,
16317,LYCIA,"For lo! the god in dusky clouds enshrined,"
16318,LYCIA,Approaching dealt a staggering blow behind.
16319,LYCIA,The weighty shock his neck and shoulders feel;
16320,LYCIA,"His eyes flash sparkles, his stunn’d senses reel"
16321,LYCIA,"In giddy darkness; far to distance flung,"
16322,LYCIA,His bounding helmet on the champaign rung.
16323,LYCIA,Achilles’ plume is stain’d with dust and gore;
16324,LYCIA,That plume which never stoop’d to earth before;
16325,LYCIA,"Long used, untouch’d, in fighting fields to shine,"
16326,LYCIA,And shade the temples of the mad divine.
16327,LYCIA,Jove dooms it now on Hector’s helm to nod;
16328,LYCIA,"Not long—for fate pursues him, and the god."
16329,LYCIA,
16330,LYCIA,His spear in shivers falls; his ample shield
16331,LYCIA,Drops from his arm: his baldric strows the field:
16332,LYCIA,The corslet his astonish’d breast forsakes:
16333,LYCIA,Loose is each joint; each nerve with horror shakes;
16334,LYCIA,"Stupid he stares, and all-assistless stands:"
16335,LYCIA,Such is the force of more than mortal hands!
16336,LYCIA,
16337,LYCIA,"A Dardan youth there was, well known to fame,"
16338,LYCIA,"From Panthus sprung, Euphorbus was his name;"
16339,LYCIA,"Famed for the manage of the foaming horse,"
16340,LYCIA,"Skill’d in the dart, and matchless in the course:"
16341,LYCIA,"Full twenty knights he tumbled from the car,"
16342,LYCIA,While yet he learn’d his rudiments of war.
16343,LYCIA,His venturous spear first drew the hero’s gore;
16344,LYCIA,"He struck, he wounded, but he durst no more."
16345,LYCIA,"Nor, though disarm’d, Patroclus’ fury stood:"
16346,LYCIA,But swift withdrew the long-protended wood.
16347,LYCIA,"And turn’d him short, and herded in the crowd."
16348,LYCIA,"Thus, by an arm divine, and mortal spear,"
16349,LYCIA,"Wounded, at once, Patroclus yields to fear,"
16350,LYCIA,"Retires for succour to his social train,"
16351,LYCIA,"And flies the fate, which heaven decreed, in vain."
16352,LYCIA,"Stern Hector, as the bleeding chief he views,"
16353,LYCIA,"Breaks through the ranks, and his retreat pursues:"
16354,LYCIA,The lance arrests him with a mortal wound;
16355,LYCIA,"He falls, earth thunders, and his arms resound."
16356,LYCIA,With him all Greece was sunk; that moment all
16357,LYCIA,Her yet-surviving heroes seem’d to fall.
16358,LYCIA,"So, scorch’d with heat, along the desert score,"
16359,LYCIA,"The roaming lion meets a bristly boar,"
16360,LYCIA,"Fast by the spring; they both dispute the flood,"
16361,LYCIA,"With flaming eyes, and jaws besmear’d with blood;"
16362,LYCIA,At length the sovereign savage wins the strife;
16363,LYCIA,And the torn boar resigns his thirst and life.
16364,LYCIA,"Patroclus thus, so many chiefs o’erthrown,"
16365,LYCIA,"So many lives effused, expires his own."
16366,LYCIA,"As dying now at Hector’s feet he lies,"
16367,LYCIA,"He sternly views him, and triumphant cries:"
16368,LYCIA,
16369,LYCIA,"“Lie there, Patroclus! and with thee, the joy"
16370,LYCIA,"Thy pride once promised, of subverting Troy;"
16371,LYCIA,"The fancied scenes of Ilion wrapt in flames,"
16372,LYCIA,And thy soft pleasures served with captive dames.
16373,LYCIA,"Unthinking man! I fought those towers to free,"
16374,LYCIA,And guard that beauteous race from lords like thee:
16375,LYCIA,But thou a prey to vultures shalt be made;
16376,LYCIA,Thy own Achilles cannot lend thee aid;
16377,LYCIA,"Though much at parting that great chief might say,"
16378,LYCIA,"And much enjoin thee, this important day."
16379,LYCIA,
16380,LYCIA,"‘Return not, my brave friend (perhaps he said),"
16381,LYCIA,Without the bloody arms of Hector dead.’
16382,LYCIA,"He spoke, Patroclus march’d, and thus he sped.”"
16383,LYCIA,
16384,LYCIA,"Supine, and wildly gazing on the skies,"
16385,LYCIA,"With faint, expiring breath, the chief replies:"
16386,LYCIA,
16387,LYCIA,"“Vain boaster! cease, and know the powers divine!"
16388,LYCIA,"Jove’s and Apollo’s is this deed, not thine;"
16389,LYCIA,"To heaven is owed whate’er your own you call,"
16390,LYCIA,And heaven itself disarm’d me ere my fall.
16391,LYCIA,"Had twenty mortals, each thy match in might,"
16392,LYCIA,"Opposed me fairly, they had sunk in fight:"
16393,LYCIA,"By fate and Phœbus was I first o’erthrown,"
16394,LYCIA,Euphorbus next; the third mean part thy own.
16395,LYCIA,"But thou, imperious! hear my latest breath;"
16396,LYCIA,"The gods inspire it, and it sounds thy death:"
16397,LYCIA,"Insulting man, thou shalt be soon as I;"
16398,LYCIA,"Black fate o’erhangs thee, and thy hour draws nigh;"
16399,LYCIA,"Even now on life’s last verge I see thee stand,"
16400,LYCIA,"I see thee fall, and by Achilles’ hand.”"
16401,LYCIA,
16402,LYCIA,"He faints: the soul unwilling wings her way,"
16403,LYCIA,(The beauteous body left a load of clay)
16404,LYCIA,"Flits to the lone, uncomfortable coast;"
16405,LYCIA,"A naked, wandering, melancholy ghost!"
16406,LYCIA,
16407,LYCIA,"Then Hector pausing, as his eyes he fed"
16408,LYCIA,"On the pale carcase, thus address’d the dead:"
16409,LYCIA,
16410,LYCIA,"“From whence this boding speech, the stern decree"
16411,LYCIA,"Of death denounced, or why denounced to me?"
16412,LYCIA,Why not as well Achilles’ fate be given
16413,LYCIA,To Hector’s lance? Who knows the will of heaven?”
16414,LYCIA,
16415,LYCIA,Pensive he said; then pressing as he lay
16416,LYCIA,"His breathless bosom, tore the lance away;"
16417,LYCIA,And upwards cast the corse: the reeking spear
16418,LYCIA,"He shakes, and charges the bold charioteer."
16419,LYCIA,But swift Automedon with loosen’d reins
16420,LYCIA,"Rapt in the chariot o’er the distant plains,"
16421,LYCIA,Far from his rage the immortal coursers drove;
16422,LYCIA,The immortal coursers were the gift of Jove.

18525,THE RECONCILIATION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON.,The sacred herald rolls the victim slain
18526,THE RECONCILIATION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON.,(A feast for fish) into the foaming main.
18527,THE RECONCILIATION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON.,
18528,THE RECONCILIATION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON.,"Then thus Achilles: “Hear, ye Greeks! and know"

19683,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Not till proud Hector, guardian of her wall,"
19684,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Or stain this lance, or see Achilles fall.”"
19685,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],
19686,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],He said; and drove with fury on the foe.
19687,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],Then to the godhead of the silver bow
19688,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],The yellow flood began: “O son of Jove!
19689,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],Was not the mandate of the sire above
19690,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Full and express, that Phœbus should employ"
19691,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"His sacred arrows in defence of Troy,"
19692,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"And make her conquer, till Hyperion’s fall"
19693,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],In awful darkness hide the face of all?”
19694,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],
19695,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],He spoke in vain—The chief without dismay
19696,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],Ploughs through the boiling surge his desperate way.
19697,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Then rising in his rage above the shores,"
19698,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"From all his deep the bellowing river roars,"
19699,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Huge heaps of slain disgorges on the coast,"
19700,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],And round the banks the ghastly dead are toss’d.
19701,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"While all before, the billows ranged on high,"
19702,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"(A watery bulwark,) screen the bands who fly."
19703,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Now bursting on his head with thundering sound,"
19704,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],The falling deluge whelms the hero round:
19705,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],His loaded shield bends to the rushing tide;
19706,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"His feet, upborne, scarce the strong flood divide,"
19707,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Sliddering, and staggering. On the border stood"
19708,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"A spreading elm, that overhung the flood;"
19709,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"He seized a bending bough, his steps to stay;"
19710,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],The plant uprooted to his weight gave way.[270]
19711,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Heaving the bank, and undermining all;"
19712,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],Loud flash the waters to the rushing fall
19713,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],Of the thick foliage. The large trunk display’d
19714,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],Bridged the rough flood across: the hero stay’d
19715,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"On this his weight, and raised upon his hand,"
19716,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Leap’d from the channel, and regain’d the land."
19717,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],Then blacken’d the wild waves: the murmur rose:
19718,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"The god pursues, a huger billow throws,"
19719,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"And bursts the bank, ambitious to destroy"
19720,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],The man whose fury is the fate of Troy.
19721,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],He like the warlike eagle speeds his pace
19722,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],(Swiftest and strongest of the aerial race);
19723,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Far as a spear can fly, Achilles springs;"
19724,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],At every bound his clanging armour rings:
19725,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Now here, now there, he turns on every side,"
19726,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],And winds his course before the following tide;
19727,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"The waves flow after, wheresoe’er he wheels,"
19728,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"And gather fast, and murmur at his heels."
19729,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],So when a peasant to his garden brings
19730,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Soft rills of water from the bubbling springs,"
19731,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"And calls the floods from high, to bless his bowers,"
19732,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],And feed with pregnant streams the plants and flowers:
19733,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Soon as he clears whate’er their passage stay’d,"
19734,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"And marks the future current with his spade,"
19735,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Swift o’er the rolling pebbles, down the hills,"
19736,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],Louder and louder purl the falling rills;
19737,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Before him scattering, they prevent his pains,"
19738,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],And shine in mazy wanderings o’er the plains.
19739,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],
19740,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Still flies Achilles, but before his eyes"
19741,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],Still swift Scamander rolls where’er he flies:
19742,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],Not all his speed escapes the rapid floods;
19743,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"The first of men, but not a match for gods."
19744,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Oft as he turn’d the torrent to oppose,"
19745,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],And bravely try if all the powers were foes;
19746,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"So oft the surge, in watery mountains spread,"
19747,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Beats on his back, or bursts upon his head."
19748,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Yet dauntless still the adverse flood he braves,"
19749,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],And still indignant bounds above the waves.
19750,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Tired by the tides, his knees relax with toil;"
19751,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],Wash’d from beneath him slides the slimy soil;
19752,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],When thus (his eyes on heaven’s expansion thrown)
19753,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],Forth bursts the hero with an angry groan:
19754,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],
19755,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"“Is there no god Achilles to befriend,"
19756,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],No power to avert his miserable end?
19757,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Prevent, O Jove! this ignominious date,[271]"
19758,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],And make my future life the sport of fate.
19759,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Of all heaven’s oracles believed in vain,"
19760,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],But most of Thetis must her son complain;
19761,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"By Phœbus’ darts she prophesied my fall,"
19762,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],In glorious arms before the Trojan wall.
19763,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Oh! had I died in fields of battle warm,"
19764,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Stretch’d like a hero, by a hero’s arm!"
19765,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Might Hector’s spear this dauntless bosom rend,"
19766,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],And my swift soul o’ertake my slaughter’d friend.
19767,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Ah no! Achilles meets a shameful fate,"
19768,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],Oh how unworthy of the brave and great!
19769,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Like some vile swain, whom on a rainy day,"
19770,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Crossing a ford, the torrent sweeps away,"
19771,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],An unregarded carcase to the sea.”
19772,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],
19773,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Neptune and Pallas haste to his relief,"
19774,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],And thus in human form address’d the chief:
19775,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"The power of ocean first: “Forbear thy fear,"
19776,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"O son of Peleus! Lo, thy gods appear!"
19777,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Behold! from Jove descending to thy aid,"
19778,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Propitious Neptune, and the blue-eyed maid."
19779,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Stay, and the furious flood shall cease to rave"
19780,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],’Tis not thy fate to glut his angry wave.
19781,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"But thou, the counsel heaven suggests, attend!"
19782,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Nor breathe from combat, nor thy sword suspend,"
19783,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Till Troy receive her flying sons, till all"
19784,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],Her routed squadrons pant behind their wall:
19785,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Hector alone shall stand his fatal chance,"
19786,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],And Hector’s blood shall smoke upon thy lance.
19787,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],Thine is the glory doom’d.” Thus spake the gods:
19788,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],Then swift ascended to the bright abodes.
19789,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],
19790,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Stung with new ardour, thus by heaven impell’d,"
19791,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"He springs impetuous, and invades the field:"
19792,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],O’er all the expanded plain the waters spread;
19793,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Heaved on the bounding billows danced the dead,"
19794,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],Floating ’midst scatter’d arms; while casques of gold
19795,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],And turn’d-up bucklers glitter’d as they roll’d.
19796,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"High o’er the surging tide, by leaps and bounds,"
19797,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"He wades, and mounts; the parted wave resounds."
19798,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Not a whole river stops the hero’s course,"
19799,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],While Pallas fills him with immortal force.
19800,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"With equal rage, indignant Xanthus roars,"
19801,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"And lifts his billows, and o’erwhelms his shores."
19802,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],
19803,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Then thus to Simois! “Haste, my brother flood;"
19804,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],And check this mortal that controls a god;
19805,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Our bravest heroes else shall quit the fight,"
19806,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],And Ilion tumble from her towery height.
19807,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Call then thy subject streams, and bid them roar,"
19808,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"From all thy fountains swell thy watery store,"
19809,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"With broken rocks, and with a load of dead,"
19810,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Charge the black surge, and pour it on his head."
19811,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Mark how resistless through the floods he goes,"
19812,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],And boldly bids the warring gods be foes!
19813,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"But nor that force, nor form divine to sight,"
19814,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Shall aught avail him, if our rage unite:"
19815,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Whelm’d under our dark gulfs those arms shall lie,"
19816,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],That blaze so dreadful in each Trojan eye;
19817,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"And deep beneath a sandy mountain hurl’d,"
19818,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],Immersed remain this terror of the world.
19819,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Such ponderous ruin shall confound the place,"
19820,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"No Greeks shall e’er his perish’d relics grace,"
19821,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"No hand his bones shall gather, or inhume;"

19850,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],The power ignipotent her word obeys:

20201,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"Who ’scaped by flight, or who by battle fell."
20202,THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269],"’Twas tumult all, and violence of flight;"

20219,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"The Trojans being safe within the walls, Hector only stays to oppose"
20220,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Achilles. Priam is struck at his approach, and tries to persuade his"
20221,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"son to re-enter the town. Hecuba joins her entreaties, but in vain."
20222,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Hector consults within himself what measures to take; but at the
20223,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"advance of Achilles, his resolution fails him, and he flies. Achilles"
20224,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,pursues him thrice round the walls of Troy. The gods debate concerning
20225,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,the fate of Hector; at length Minerva descends to the aid of Achilles.
20226,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"She deludes Hector in the shape of Deiphobus; he stands the combat, and"
20227,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,is slain. Achilles drags the dead body at his chariot in the sight of
20228,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Priam and Hecuba. Their lamentations, tears, and despair. Their cries"
20229,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"reach the ears of Andromache, who, ignorant of this, was retired into"
20230,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"the inner part of the palace: she mounts up to the walls, and beholds"
20231,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,her dead husband. She swoons at the spectacle. Her excess of grief and
20232,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,lamentation.
20233,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"The thirtieth day still continues. The scene lies under the walls,"
20234,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,and on the battlements of Troy.

20236,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20237,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Thus to their bulwarks, smit with panic fear,"
20238,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,The herded Ilians rush like driven deer:
20239,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"There safe they wipe the briny drops away,"
20240,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,And drown in bowls the labours of the day.

20242,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Beneath one roof of well-compacted shields,"
20243,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"March, bending on, the Greeks’ embodied powers,"
20244,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Far stretching in the shade of Trojan towers.
20245,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Great Hector singly stay’d: chain’d down by fate
20246,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,There fix’d he stood before the Scæan gate;
20247,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Still his bold arms determined to employ,"
20248,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,The guardian still of long-defended Troy.

20253,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,With mortal speed a godhead to pursue?
20254,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"For not to thee to know the gods is given,"
20255,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Unskill’d to trace the latent marks of heaven.
20256,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"What boots thee now, that Troy forsook the plain?"
20257,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Vain thy past labour, and thy present vain:"
20258,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Safe in their walls are now her troops bestow’d,"
20259,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,While here thy frantic rage attacks a god.”
20260,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20261,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,The chief incensed—“Too partial god of day!
20262,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,To check my conquests in the middle way:
20263,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,How few in Ilion else had refuge found!
20264,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,What gasping numbers now had bit the ground!
20265,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Thou robb’st me of a glory justly mine,"
20266,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Powerful of godhead, and of fraud divine:"
20267,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Mean fame, alas! for one of heavenly strain,"

20270,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Then to the city, terrible and strong,"

20274,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Him, as he blazing shot across the field,"
20275,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,The careful eyes of Priam first beheld.
20276,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Not half so dreadful rises to the sight,[274]"
20277,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Through the thick gloom of some tempestuous night,"
20278,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Orion’s dog (the year when autumn weighs),"
20279,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,And o’er the feebler stars exerts his rays;
20280,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Terrific glory! for his burning breath
20281,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Taints the red air with fevers, plagues, and death."
20282,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,So flamed his fiery mail. Then wept the sage:
20283,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"He strikes his reverend head, now white with age;"
20284,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,He lifts his wither’d arms; obtests the skies;
20285,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,He calls his much-loved son with feeble cries:
20286,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"The son, resolved Achilles’ force to dare,"
20287,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Full at the Scæan gates expects the war;
20288,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"While the sad father on the rampart stands,"
20289,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,And thus adjures him with extended hands:
20290,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20291,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"“Ah stay not, stay not! guardless and alone;"
20292,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Hector! my loved, my dearest, bravest son!"
20293,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Methinks already I behold thee slain,"
20294,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,And stretch’d beneath that fury of the plain.
20295,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Implacable Achilles! might’st thou be
20296,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,To all the gods no dearer than to me!
20297,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Thee, vultures wild should scatter round the shore,"
20298,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,And bloody dogs grow fiercer from thy gore.
20299,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"How many valiant sons I late enjoy’d,"
20300,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Valiant in vain! by thy cursed arm destroy’d:
20301,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Or, worse than slaughtered, sold in distant isles"
20302,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"To shameful bondage, and unworthy toils."
20303,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Two, while I speak, my eyes in vain explore,"
20304,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Two from one mother sprung, my Polydore,"
20305,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,And loved Lycaon; now perhaps no more!
20306,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Oh! if in yonder hostile camp they live,"
20307,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"What heaps of gold, what treasures would I give!"
20308,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"(Their grandsire’s wealth, by right of birth their own,"
20309,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Consign’d his daughter with Lelegia’s throne:)
20310,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"But if (which Heaven forbid) already lost,"
20311,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,All pale they wander on the Stygian coast;
20312,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"What sorrows then must their sad mother know,"
20313,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,What anguish I? unutterable woe!
20314,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Yet less that anguish, less to her, to me,"
20315,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Less to all Troy, if not deprived of thee."
20316,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Yet shun Achilles! enter yet the wall;
20317,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"And spare thyself, thy father, spare us all!"
20318,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Save thy dear life; or, if a soul so brave"
20319,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Neglect that thought, thy dearer glory save."
20320,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Pity, while yet I live, these silver hairs;"
20321,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"While yet thy father feels the woes he bears,"
20322,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Yet cursed with sense! a wretch, whom in his rage"
20323,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,(All trembling on the verge of helpless age)
20324,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Great Jove has placed, sad spectacle of pain!"
20325,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,The bitter dregs of fortune’s cup to drain:
20326,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"To fill with scenes of death his closing eyes,"
20327,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,And number all his days by miseries!
20328,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"My heroes slain, my bridal bed o’erturn’d,"
20329,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"My daughters ravish’d, and my city burn’d,"
20330,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,My bleeding infants dash’d against the floor;
20331,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"These I have yet to see, perhaps yet more!"
20332,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Perhaps even I, reserved by angry fate,"
20333,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"The last sad relic of my ruin’d state,"
20334,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"(Dire pomp of sovereign wretchedness!) must fall,"
20335,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,And stain the pavement of my regal hall;
20336,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Where famish’d dogs, late guardians of my door,"
20337,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Shall lick their mangled master’s spatter’d gore.
20338,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Yet for my sons I thank ye, gods! ’tis well;"
20339,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Well have they perish’d, for in fight they fell."
20340,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Who dies in youth and vigour, dies the best,"
20341,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Struck through with wounds, all honest on the breast."
20342,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"But when the fates, in fulness of their rage,"
20343,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Spurn the hoar head of unresisting age,"
20344,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"In dust the reverend lineaments deform,"
20345,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,And pour to dogs the life-blood scarcely warm:
20346,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"This, this is misery! the last, the worse,"
20347,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"That man can feel! man, fated to be cursed!”"
20348,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20349,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"He said, and acting what no words could say,"
20350,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Rent from his head the silver locks away.
20351,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,With him the mournful mother bears a part;
20352,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Yet all her sorrows turn not Hector’s heart.
20353,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"The zone unbraced, her bosom she display’d;"
20354,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"And thus, fast-falling the salt tears, she said:"
20355,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20356,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"“Have mercy on me, O my son! revere"
20357,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,The words of age; attend a parent’s prayer!
20358,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"If ever thee in these fond arms I press’d,"
20359,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Or still’d thy infant clamours at this breast;
20360,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Ah do not thus our helpless years forego,"
20361,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"But, by our walls secured, repel the foe."
20362,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Against his rage if singly thou proceed,"
20363,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Should’st thou, (but Heaven avert it!) should’st thou bleed,"
20364,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Nor must thy corse lie honour’d on the bier,"
20365,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Nor spouse, nor mother, grace thee with a tear!"
20366,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Far from our pious rites those dear remains
20367,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Must feast the vultures on the naked plains.”
20368,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20369,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"So they, while down their cheeks the torrents roll;"

20371,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Resolved he stands, and with a fiery glance"
20372,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Expects the hero’s terrible advance.
20373,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"So, roll’d up in his den, the swelling snake"

20375,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,When fed with noxious herbs his turgid veins
20376,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Have gather’d half the poisons of the plains;
20377,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"He burns, he stiffens with collected ire,"
20378,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,And his red eyeballs glare with living fire.
20379,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Beneath a turret, on his shield reclined,"
20380,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"He stood, and question’d thus his mighty mind:[275]"
20381,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20382,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,“Where lies my way? to enter in the wall?
20383,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Honour and shame the ungenerous thought recall:
20384,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Shall proud Polydamas before the gate

20386,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Which timely follow’d but the former night,"
20387,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,What numbers had been saved by Hector’s flight?
20388,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"That wise advice rejected with disdain,"
20389,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,I feel my folly in my people slain.
20390,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Methinks my suffering country’s voice I hear,"
20391,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"But most her worthless sons insult my ear,"
20392,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"On my rash courage charge the chance of war,"
20393,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,And blame those virtues which they cannot share.
20394,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"No—if I e’er return, return I must"
20395,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Glorious, my country’s terror laid in dust:"
20396,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Or if I perish, let her see me fall"
20397,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"In field at least, and fighting for her wall."
20398,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"And yet suppose these measures I forego,"
20399,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Approach unarm’d, and parley with the foe,"
20400,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"The warrior-shield, the helm, and lance, lay down,"
20401,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,And treat on terms of peace to save the town:
20402,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"The wife withheld, the treasure ill-detain’d"
20403,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"(Cause of the war, and grievance of the land)"
20404,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,With honourable justice to restore:
20405,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"And add half Ilion’s yet remaining store,"
20406,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Which Troy shall, sworn, produce; that injured Greece"
20407,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"May share our wealth, and leave our walls in peace."
20408,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"But why this thought? Unarm’d if I should go,"
20409,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"What hope of mercy from this vengeful foe,"
20410,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"But woman-like to fall, and fall without a blow?"
20411,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"We greet not here, as man conversing man,"
20412,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Met at an oak, or journeying o’er a plain;"
20413,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"No season now for calm familiar talk,"
20414,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Like youths and maidens in an evening walk:
20415,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"War is our business, but to whom is given"
20416,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"To die, or triumph, that, determine Heaven!”"
20417,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20418,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Thus pondering, like a god the Greek drew nigh;"
20419,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,His dreadful plumage nodded from on high;
20420,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"The Pelian javelin, in his better hand,"
20421,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Shot trembling rays that glitter’d o’er the land;
20422,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"And on his breast the beamy splendour shone,"
20423,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Like Jove’s own lightning, or the rising sun."
20424,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"As Hector sees, unusual terrors rise,"
20425,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Struck by some god, he fears, recedes, and flies."
20426,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"He leaves the gates, he leaves the wall behind:"
20427,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Achilles follows like the winged wind.
20428,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Thus at the panting dove a falcon flies
20429,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"(The swiftest racer of the liquid skies),"
20430,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Just when he holds, or thinks he holds his prey,"
20431,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Obliquely wheeling through the aerial way,"
20432,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"With open beak and shrilling cries he springs,"
20433,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"And aims his claws, and shoots upon his wings:"
20434,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"No less fore-right the rapid chase they held,"
20435,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"One urged by fury, one by fear impell’d:"
20436,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Now circling round the walls their course maintain,"
20437,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Where the high watch-tower overlooks the plain;
20438,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Now where the fig-trees spread their umbrage broad,"
20439,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"(A wider compass,) smoke along the road."
20440,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Next by Scamander’s double source they bound,"
20441,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Where two famed fountains burst the parted ground;
20442,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"This hot through scorching clefts is seen to rise,"
20443,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,With exhalations steaming to the skies;
20444,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"That the green banks in summer’s heat o’erflows,"
20445,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Like crystal clear, and cold as winter snows:"
20446,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Each gushing fount a marble cistern fills,"
20447,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Whose polish’d bed receives the falling rills;
20448,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Where Trojan dames (ere yet alarm’d by Greece)
20449,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Wash’d their fair garments in the days of peace.[276]
20450,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"By these they pass’d, one chasing, one in flight:"
20451,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"(The mighty fled, pursued by stronger might:)"
20452,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Swift was the course; no vulgar prize they play,"
20453,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,No vulgar victim must reward the day:
20454,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,(Such as in races crown the speedy strife:)
20455,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,The prize contended was great Hector’s life.
20456,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,As when some hero’s funerals are decreed
20457,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,In grateful honour of the mighty dead;
20458,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Where high rewards the vigorous youth inflame
20459,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"(Some golden tripod, or some lovely dame)"
20460,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"The panting coursers swiftly turn the goal,"
20461,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,And with them turns the raised spectator’s soul:
20462,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Thus three times round the Trojan wall they fly.
20463,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,The gazing gods lean forward from the sky;
20464,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"To whom, while eager on the chase they look,"
20465,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,The sire of mortals and immortals spoke:
20466,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20467,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"“Unworthy sight! the man beloved of heaven,"
20468,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Behold, inglorious round yon city driven!"
20469,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,My heart partakes the generous Hector’s pain;
20470,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Hector, whose zeal whole hecatombs has slain,"
20471,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Whose grateful fumes the gods received with joy,"
20472,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"From Ida’s summits, and the towers of Troy:"
20473,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Now see him flying; to his fears resign’d,"
20474,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"And fate, and fierce Achilles, close behind."
20475,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Consult, ye powers! (’tis worthy your debate)"
20476,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Whether to snatch him from impending fate,"
20477,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Or let him bear, by stern Pelides slain,"
20478,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,(Good as he is) the lot imposed on man.”

20503,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"From the high turrets might oppress the foe,)"
20504,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,So oft Achilles turns him to the plain:
20505,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"He eyes the city, but he eyes in vain."

20514,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,With fate itself so long to hold the course?
20515,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Phœbus it was; who, in his latest hour,"
20516,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Endued his knees with strength, his nerves with power:"
20517,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"And great Achilles, lest some Greek’s advance"
20518,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Should snatch the glory from his lifted lance,"
20519,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Sign’d to the troops to yield his foe the way,"
20520,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,And leave untouch’d the honours of the day.
20521,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20522,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Jove lifts the golden balances, that show"
20523,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"The fates of mortal men, and things below:"
20524,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Here each contending hero’s lot he tries,"
20525,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"And weighs, with equal hand, their destinies."
20526,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Low sinks the scale surcharged with Hector’s fate;
20527,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Heavy with death it sinks, and hell receives the weight."
20528,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20529,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Then Phœbus left him. Fierce Minerva flies
20530,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"To stern Pelides, and triumphing, cries:"
20531,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"“O loved of Jove! this day our labours cease,"
20532,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,And conquest blazes with full beams on Greece.
20533,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Great Hector falls; that Hector famed so far,"
20534,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Drunk with renown, insatiable of war,"
20535,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Falls by thy hand, and mine! nor force, nor flight,"
20536,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Shall more avail him, nor his god of light."
20537,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"See, where in vain he supplicates above,"
20538,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Roll’d at the feet of unrelenting Jove;
20539,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Rest here: myself will lead the Trojan on,"
20540,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,And urge to meet the fate he cannot shun.”
20541,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20542,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Her voice divine the chief with joyful mind
20543,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Obey’d; and rested, on his lance reclined"
20544,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,While like Deiphobus the martial dame
20545,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"(Her face, her gesture, and her arms the same),"
20546,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"In show an aid, by hapless Hector’s side"
20547,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Approach’d, and greets him thus with voice belied:"
20548,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20549,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"“Too long, O Hector! have I borne the sight"
20550,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Of this distress, and sorrow’d in thy flight:"
20551,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"It fits us now a noble stand to make,"
20552,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"And here, as brothers, equal fates partake.”"
20553,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20554,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Then he: “O prince! allied in blood and fame,"
20555,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Dearer than all that own a brother’s name;
20556,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Of all that Hecuba to Priam bore,"
20557,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Long tried, long loved: much loved, but honoured more!"
20558,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Since you, of all our numerous race alone"
20559,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Defend my life, regardless of your own.”"
20560,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20561,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Again the goddess: “Much my father’s prayer,"
20562,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"And much my mother’s, press’d me to forbear:"
20563,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"My friends embraced my knees, adjured my stay,"
20564,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"But stronger love impell’d, and I obey."
20565,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Come then, the glorious conflict let us try,"
20566,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Let the steel sparkle, and the javelin fly;"
20567,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Or let us stretch Achilles on the field,"
20568,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Or to his arm our bloody trophies yield.”
20569,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20570,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Fraudful she said; then swiftly march’d before:
20571,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,The Dardan hero shuns his foe no more.
20572,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Sternly they met. The silence Hector broke:
20573,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,His dreadful plumage nodded as he spoke:
20574,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20575,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"“Enough, O son of Peleus! Troy has view’d"
20576,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Her walls thrice circled, and her chief pursued."
20577,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,But now some god within me bids me try
20578,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Thine, or my fate: I kill thee, or I die."
20579,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Yet on the verge of battle let us stay,"
20580,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,And for a moment’s space suspend the day;
20581,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Let Heaven’s high powers be call’d to arbitrate
20582,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"The just conditions of this stern debate,"
20583,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"(Eternal witnesses of all below,"
20584,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,And faithful guardians of the treasured vow!)
20585,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"To them I swear; if, victor in the strife,"
20586,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Jove by these hands shall shed thy noble life,"
20587,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,No vile dishonour shall thy corse pursue;
20588,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Stripp’d of its arms alone (the conqueror’s due)
20589,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,The rest to Greece uninjured I’ll restore:
20590,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Now plight thy mutual oath, I ask no more.”"
20591,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20592,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"“Talk not of oaths (the dreadful chief replies,"
20593,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"While anger flash’d from his disdainful eyes),"
20594,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Detested as thou art, and ought to be,"
20595,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Nor oath nor pact Achilles plights with thee:
20596,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Such pacts as lambs and rabid wolves combine,"
20597,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Such leagues as men and furious lions join,"
20598,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,To such I call the gods! one constant state
20599,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Of lasting rancour and eternal hate:
20600,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"No thought but rage, and never-ceasing strife,"
20601,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Till death extinguish rage, and thought, and life."
20602,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Rouse then thy forces this important hour,"
20603,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Collect thy soul, and call forth all thy power."
20604,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"No further subterfuge, no further chance;"
20605,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"’Tis Pallas, Pallas gives thee to my lance."
20606,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Each Grecian ghost, by thee deprived of breath,"
20607,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Now hovers round, and calls thee to thy death.”"
20608,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20609,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"He spoke, and launch’d his javelin at the foe;"
20610,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,But Hector shunn’d the meditated blow:
20611,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"He stoop’d, while o’er his head the flying spear"
20612,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Sang innocent, and spent its force in air."
20613,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Minerva watch’d it falling on the land,"
20614,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Then drew, and gave to great Achilles’ hand,"
20615,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Unseen of Hector, who, elate with joy,"
20616,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Now shakes his lance, and braves the dread of Troy."
20617,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20618,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"“The life you boasted to that javelin given,"
20619,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Prince! you have miss’d. My fate depends on Heaven,"
20620,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"To thee, presumptuous as thou art, unknown,"
20621,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Or what must prove my fortune, or thy own."
20622,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Boasting is but an art, our fears to blind,"
20623,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,And with false terrors sink another’s mind.
20624,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"But know, whatever fate I am to try,"
20625,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,By no dishonest wound shall Hector die.
20626,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"I shall not fall a fugitive at least,"
20627,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,My soul shall bravely issue from my breast.
20628,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"But first, try thou my arm; and may this dart"
20629,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"End all my country’s woes, deep buried in thy heart.”"
20630,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20631,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"The weapon flew, its course unerring held,"
20632,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Unerring, but the heavenly shield repell’d"
20633,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,The mortal dart; resulting with a bound
20634,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"From off the ringing orb, it struck the ground."
20635,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Hector beheld his javelin fall in vain,"
20636,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Nor other lance, nor other hope remain;"
20637,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"He calls Deiphobus, demands a spear—"
20638,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"In vain, for no Deiphobus was there."
20639,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"All comfortless he stands: then, with a sigh;"
20640,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"“’Tis so—Heaven wills it, and my hour is nigh!"
20641,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"I deem’d Deiphobus had heard my call,"
20642,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,But he secure lies guarded in the wall.
20643,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"A god deceived me; Pallas, ’twas thy deed,"
20644,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Death and black fate approach! ’tis I must bleed.
20645,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"No refuge now, no succour from above,"
20646,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Great Jove deserts me, and the son of Jove,"
20647,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Propitious once, and kind! Then welcome fate!"
20648,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"’Tis true I perish, yet I perish great:"
20649,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Yet in a mighty deed I shall expire,"
20650,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Let future ages hear it, and admire!”"
20651,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20652,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Fierce, at the word, his weighty sword he drew,"
20653,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"And, all collected, on Achilles flew."
20654,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"So Jove’s bold bird, high balanced in the air,"
20655,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Stoops from the clouds to truss the quivering hare.
20656,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Nor less Achilles his fierce soul prepares:
20657,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Before his breast the flaming shield he bears,"
20658,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Refulgent orb! above his fourfold cone
20659,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,The gilded horse-hair sparkled in the sun.
20660,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Nodding at every step: (Vulcanian frame!)
20661,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"And as he moved, his figure seem’d on flame."
20662,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"As radiant Hesper shines with keener light,[277]"
20663,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Far-beaming o’er the silver host of night,"
20664,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,When all the starry train emblaze the sphere:
20665,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,So shone the point of great Achilles’ spear.
20666,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"In his right hand he waves the weapon round,"
20667,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Eyes the whole man, and meditates the wound;"
20668,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,But the rich mail Patroclus lately wore
20669,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Securely cased the warrior’s body o’er.
20670,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"One space at length he spies, to let in fate,"
20671,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Where ’twixt the neck and throat the jointed plate
20672,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Gave entrance: through that penetrable part
20673,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Furious he drove the well-directed dart:
20674,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Nor pierced the windpipe yet, nor took the power"
20675,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Of speech, unhappy! from thy dying hour."
20676,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Prone on the field the bleeding warrior lies,"
20677,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"While, thus triumphing, stern Achilles cries:"
20678,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20679,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"“At last is Hector stretch’d upon the plain,"
20680,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Who fear’d no vengeance for Patroclus slain:
20681,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Then, prince! you should have fear’d, what now you feel;"
20682,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Achilles absent was Achilles still:
20683,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Yet a short space the great avenger stayed,"
20684,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Then low in dust thy strength and glory laid.
20685,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Peaceful he sleeps, with all our rites adorn’d,"
20686,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"For ever honour’d, and for ever mourn’d:"
20687,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"While cast to all the rage of hostile power,"
20688,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Thee birds shall mangle, and the gods devour.”"
20689,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20690,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Then Hector, fainting at the approach of death:"
20691,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,“By thy own soul! by those who gave thee breath!
20692,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,By all the sacred prevalence of prayer;
20693,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Ah, leave me not for Grecian dogs to tear!"
20694,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"The common rites of sepulture bestow,"
20695,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,To soothe a father’s and a mother’s woe:
20696,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Let their large gifts procure an urn at least,"
20697,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,And Hector’s ashes in his country rest.”
20698,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20699,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"“No, wretch accursed! relentless he replies;"
20700,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"(Flames, as he spoke, shot flashing from his eyes;)"
20701,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Not those who gave me breath should bid me spare,"
20702,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Nor all the sacred prevalence of prayer.
20703,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Could I myself the bloody banquet join!
20704,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,No—to the dogs that carcase I resign.
20705,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Should Troy, to bribe me, bring forth all her store,"
20706,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"And giving thousands, offer thousands more;"
20707,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Should Dardan Priam, and his weeping dame,"
20708,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Drain their whole realm to buy one funeral flame:
20709,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Their Hector on the pile they should not see,"
20710,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Nor rob the vultures of one limb of thee.”
20711,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20712,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Then thus the chief his dying accents drew:
20713,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"“Thy rage, implacable! too well I knew:"
20714,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"The Furies that relentless breast have steel’d,"
20715,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,And cursed thee with a heart that cannot yield.
20716,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Yet think, a day will come, when fate’s decree"
20717,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,And angry gods shall wreak this wrong on thee;
20718,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Phœbus and Paris shall avenge my fate,"
20719,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,And stretch thee here before the Scæan gate.”[278]
20720,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20721,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"He ceased. The Fates suppress’d his labouring breath,"
20722,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,And his eyes stiffen’d at the hand of death;
20723,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"To the dark realm the spirit wings its way,"
20724,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"(The manly body left a load of clay,)"
20725,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"And plaintive glides along the dreary coast,"
20726,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"A naked, wandering, melancholy ghost!"
20727,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20728,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Achilles, musing as he roll’d his eyes"
20729,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"O’er the dead hero, thus unheard, replies:"
20730,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"“Die thou the first! When Jove and heaven ordain,"
20731,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"I follow thee”—He said, and stripp’d the slain."
20732,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Then forcing backward from the gaping wound
20733,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"The reeking javelin, cast it on the ground."
20734,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,The thronging Greeks behold with wondering eyes
20735,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,His manly beauty and superior size;
20736,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"While some, ignobler, the great dead deface"
20737,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"With wounds ungenerous, or with taunts disgrace:"
20738,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20739,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"“How changed that Hector, who like Jove of late"
20740,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Sent lightning on our fleets, and scatter’d fate!”"
20741,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20742,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"High o’er the slain the great Achilles stands,"
20743,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Begirt with heroes and surrounding bands;
20744,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"And thus aloud, while all the host attends:"
20745,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,“Princes and leaders! countrymen and friends!
20746,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Since now at length the powerful will of heaven
20747,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"The dire destroyer to our arm has given,"
20748,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Is not Troy fallen already? Haste, ye powers!"
20749,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"See, if already their deserted towers"
20750,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Are left unmann’d; or if they yet retain
20751,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"The souls of heroes, their great Hector slain."
20752,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"But what is Troy, or glory what to me?"
20753,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Or why reflects my mind on aught but thee,"
20754,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Divine Patroclus! Death hath seal’d his eyes;
20755,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Unwept, unhonour’d, uninterr’d he lies!"
20756,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Can his dear image from my soul depart,"
20757,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Long as the vital spirit moves my heart?
20758,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"If in the melancholy shades below,"
20759,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"The flames of friends and lovers cease to glow,"
20760,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Yet mine shall sacred last; mine, undecay’d,"
20761,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Burn on through death, and animate my shade."
20762,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Meanwhile, ye sons of Greece, in triumph bring"
20763,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"The corpse of Hector, and your pæans sing."
20764,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Be this the song, slow-moving toward the shore,"
20765,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"“Hector is dead, and Ilion is no more.””"
20766,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20767,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Then his fell soul a thought of vengeance bred;
20768,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"(Unworthy of himself, and of the dead;)"
20769,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"The nervous ancles bored, his feet he bound"
20770,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,With thongs inserted through the double wound;
20771,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"These fix’d up high behind the rolling wain,"
20772,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,His graceful head was trail’d along the plain.
20773,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Proud on his car the insulting victor stood,"
20774,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"And bore aloft his arms, distilling blood."
20775,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,He smites the steeds; the rapid chariot flies;
20776,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,The sudden clouds of circling dust arise.
20777,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Now lost is all that formidable air;
20778,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"The face divine, and long-descending hair,"
20779,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Purple the ground, and streak the sable sand;"
20780,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Deform’d, dishonour’d, in his native land,"
20781,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Given to the rage of an insulting throng,"
20782,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"And, in his parents’ sight, now dragg’d along!"
20783,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20784,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,The mother first beheld with sad survey;
20785,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"She rent her tresses, venerable grey,"
20786,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"And cast, far off, the regal veils away."
20787,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"With piercing shrieks his bitter fate she moans,"
20788,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"While the sad father answers groans with groans,"
20789,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Tears after tears his mournful cheeks o’erflow,"
20790,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,And the whole city wears one face of woe:
20791,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"No less than if the rage of hostile fires,"
20792,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"From her foundations curling to her spires,"
20793,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"O’er the proud citadel at length should rise,"
20794,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,And the last blaze send Ilion to the skies.
20795,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"The wretched monarch of the falling state,"
20796,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Distracted, presses to the Dardan gate."
20797,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Scarce the whole people stop his desperate course,"
20798,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,While strong affliction gives the feeble force:
20799,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Grief tears his heart, and drives him to and fro,"
20800,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,In all the raging impotence of woe.
20801,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"At length he roll’d in dust, and thus begun,"
20802,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Imploring all, and naming one by one:"
20803,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"“Ah! let me, let me go where sorrow calls;"
20804,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"I, only I, will issue from your walls"
20805,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"(Guide or companion, friends! I ask ye none),"
20806,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,And bow before the murderer of my son.
20807,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,My grief perhaps his pity may engage;
20808,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Perhaps at least he may respect my age.
20809,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,He has a father too; a man like me;
20810,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"One, not exempt from age and misery"
20811,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"(Vigorous no more, as when his young embrace"
20812,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Begot this pest of me, and all my race)."
20813,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"How many valiant sons, in early bloom,"
20814,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Has that cursed hand sent headlong to the tomb!
20815,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Thee, Hector! last: thy loss (divinely brave)"
20816,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Sinks my sad soul with sorrow to the grave.
20817,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"O had thy gentle spirit pass’d in peace,"
20818,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"The son expiring in the sire’s embrace,"
20819,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"While both thy parents wept the fatal hour,"
20820,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"And, bending o’er thee, mix’d the tender shower!"
20821,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Some comfort that had been, some sad relief,"
20822,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,To melt in full satiety of grief!”
20823,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20824,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Thus wail’d the father, grovelling on the ground,"
20825,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,And all the eyes of Ilion stream’d around.
20826,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,
20827,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,Amidst her matrons Hecuba appears:
20828,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"(A mourning princess, and a train in tears;)"
20829,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"“Ah why has Heaven prolong’d this hated breath,"
20830,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Patient of horrors, to behold thy death?"
20831,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"O Hector! late thy parents’ pride and joy,"
20832,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,The boast of nations! the defence of Troy!
20833,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,To whom her safety and her fame she owed;
20834,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,"Her chief, her hero, and almost her god!"
20835,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,O fatal change! become in one sad day
20836,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,A senseless corse! inanimated clay!”
20837,THE DEATH OF HECTOR.,

21114,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Confused he wakes; amazement breaks the bands
21115,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Of golden sleep, and starting from the sands,"
21116,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Pensive he muses with uplifted hands:
21117,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],
21118,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"“’Tis true, ’tis certain; man, though dead, retains"

21120,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"The form subsists without the body’s aid,"
21121,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Aerial semblance, and an empty shade!"
21122,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"This night my friend, so late in battle lost,"
21123,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Stood at my side, a pensive, plaintive ghost:"
21124,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Even now familiar, as in life, he came;"
21125,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Alas! how different! yet how like the same!”
21126,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],
21127,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Thus while he spoke, each eye grew big with tears:"
21128,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"And now the rosy-finger’d morn appears,"
21129,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Shows every mournful face with tears o’erspread,"
21130,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],And glares on the pale visage of the dead.
21131,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"But Agamemnon, as the rites demand,"
21132,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],With mules and waggons sends a chosen band
21133,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"To load the timber, and the pile to rear;"
21134,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],A charge consign’d to Merion’s faithful care.
21135,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"With proper instruments they take the road,"
21136,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Axes to cut, and ropes to sling the load."
21137,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"First march the heavy mules, securely slow,"
21138,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"O’er hills, o’er dales, o’er crags, o’er rocks they go:[285]"
21139,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Jumping, high o’er the shrubs of the rough ground,"
21140,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Rattle the clattering cars, and the shock’d axles bound."
21141,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"But when arrived at Ida’s spreading woods,[286]"
21142,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"(Fair Ida, water’d with descending floods,)"
21143,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Loud sounds the axe, redoubling strokes on strokes;"
21144,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],On all sides round the forest hurls her oaks
21145,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Headlong. Deep echoing groan the thickets brown;
21146,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Then rustling, crackling, crashing, thunder down."
21147,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"The wood the Grecians cleave, prepared to burn;"
21148,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],And the slow mules the same rough road return.
21149,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],The sturdy woodmen equal burdens bore
21150,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],(Such charge was given them) to the sandy shore;
21151,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"There on the spot which great Achilles show’d,"
21152,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"They eased their shoulders, and disposed the load;"
21153,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Circling around the place, where times to come"
21154,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Shall view Patroclus’ and Achilles’ tomb.
21155,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],The hero bids his martial troops appear
21156,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],High on their cars in all the pomp of war;
21157,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Each in refulgent arms his limbs attires,"
21158,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"All mount their chariots, combatants and squires."
21159,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"The chariots first proceed, a shining train;"
21160,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Then clouds of foot that smoke along the plain;
21161,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Next these the melancholy band appear;
21162,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Amidst, lay dead Patroclus on the bier;"
21163,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],O’er all the corse their scattered locks they throw;
21164,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Achilles next, oppress’d with mighty woe,"
21165,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Supporting with his hands the hero’s head,"
21166,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Bends o’er the extended body of the dead.
21167,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Patroclus decent on the appointed ground
21168,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"They place, and heap the sylvan pile around."
21169,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"But great Achilles stands apart in prayer,"
21170,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],And from his head divides the yellow hair;
21171,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Those curling locks which from his youth he vow’d,[287]"
21172,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"And sacred grew, to Sperchius’ honour’d flood:"
21173,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Then sighing, to the deep his locks he cast,"
21174,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],And roll’d his eyes around the watery waste:
21175,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],
21176,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],“Sperchius! whose waves in mazy errors lost
21177,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Delightful roll along my native coast!
21178,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"To whom we vainly vow’d, at our return,"
21179,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"These locks to fall, and hecatombs to burn:"
21180,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Full fifty rams to bleed in sacrifice,"
21181,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Where to the day thy silver fountains rise,"
21182,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],And where in shade of consecrated bowers
21183,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Thy altars stand, perfumed with native flowers!"
21184,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"So vow’d my father, but he vow’d in vain;"

21186,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"In that vain hope these hairs no longer grow,"
21187,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Patroclus bears them to the shades below.”
21188,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],
21189,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Thus o’er Patroclus while the hero pray’d,"
21190,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],On his cold hand the sacred lock he laid.
21191,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Once more afresh the Grecian sorrows flow:
21192,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],And now the sun had set upon their woe;
21193,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],But to the king of men thus spoke the chief:
21194,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"“Enough, Atrides! give the troops relief:"
21195,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Permit the mourning legions to retire,"
21196,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],And let the chiefs alone attend the pyre;
21197,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"The pious care be ours, the dead to burn—”"
21198,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],He said: the people to their ships return:

21200,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Heap with a rising pyramid the plain.[288]
21201,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"A hundred foot in length, a hundred wide,"
21202,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],The growing structure spreads on every side;
21203,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"High on the top the manly corse they lay,"
21204,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],And well-fed sheep and sable oxen slay:
21205,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Achilles covered with their fat the dead,"
21206,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],And the piled victims round the body spread;
21207,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Then jars of honey, and of fragrant oil,"
21208,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Suspends around, low-bending o’er the pile."
21209,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Four sprightly coursers, with a deadly groan"
21210,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Pour forth their lives, and on the pyre are thrown."
21211,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Of nine large dogs, domestic at his board,"
21212,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Fall two, selected to attend their lord,"
21213,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Then last of all, and horrible to tell,"
21214,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Sad sacrifice! twelve Trojan captives fell.[289]
21215,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"On these the rage of fire victorious preys,"
21216,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Involves and joins them in one common blaze.
21217,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Smear’d with the bloody rites, he stands on high,"
21218,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],And calls the spirit with a dreadful cry:[290]
21219,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],
21220,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"“All hail, Patroclus! let thy vengeful ghost"
21221,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Hear, and exult, on Pluto’s dreary coast."
21222,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Behold Achilles’ promise fully paid,"
21223,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Twelve Trojan heroes offer’d to thy shade;
21224,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"But heavier fates on Hector’s corse attend,"
21225,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Saved from the flames, for hungry dogs to rend.”"
21226,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],
21227,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"So spake he, threatening: but the gods made vain"
21228,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"His threat, and guard inviolate the slain:"
21229,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Celestial Venus hover’d o’er his head,"
21230,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"And roseate unguents, heavenly fragrance! shed:"
21231,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"She watch’d him all the night and all the day,"
21232,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],And drove the bloodhounds from their destined prey.
21233,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Nor sacred Phœbus less employ’d his care;
21234,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"He pour’d around a veil of gather’d air,"
21235,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"And kept the nerves undried, the flesh entire,"

21485,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],She breaks his rival’s chariot from the yoke:
21486,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],No more their way the startled horses held;
21487,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],The car reversed came rattling on the field;

21497,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"The next, though distant, Menelaus succeeds;"

21499,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"“Now, now, my generous pair, exert your force;"
21500,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Not that we hope to match Tydides’ horse,"
21501,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Since great Minerva wings their rapid way,"
21502,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],And gives their lord the honours of the day;
21503,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],But reach Atrides! shall his mare outgo
21504,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Your swiftness? vanquish’d by a female foe?

21511,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],
21512,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Thus he. The coursers at their master’s threat
21513,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],With quicker steps the sounding champaign beat.
21514,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],And now Antilochus with nice survey
21515,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Observes the compass of the hollow way.
21516,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"’Twas where, by force of wintry torrents torn,"
21517,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Fast by the road a precipice was worn:
21518,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Here, where but one could pass, to shun the throng"
21519,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],The Spartan hero’s chariot smoked along.

21523,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],And wonders at the rashness of his foe.
21524,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"“Hold, stay your steeds—What madness thus to ride"
21525,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"This narrow way! take larger field (he cried),"
21526,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Or both must fall.”—Atrides cried in vain;
21527,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"He flies more fast, and throws up all the rein."
21528,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Far as an able arm the disk can send,"
21529,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"When youthful rivals their full force extend,"
21530,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"So far, Antilochus! thy chariot flew"
21531,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Before the king: he, cautious, backward drew"
21532,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],His horse compell’d; foreboding in his fears
21533,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"The rattling ruin of the clashing cars,"
21534,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"The floundering coursers rolling on the plain,"
21535,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],And conquest lost through frantic haste to gain.
21536,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],But thus upbraids his rival as he flies:
21537,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"“Go, furious youth! ungenerous and unwise!"
21538,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Go, but expect not I’ll the prize resign;"
21539,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Add perjury to fraud, and make it thine—”"
21540,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Then to his steeds with all his force he cries,"
21541,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"“Be swift, be vigorous, and regain the prize!"
21542,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Your rivals, destitute of youthful force,"
21543,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"With fainting knees shall labour in the course,"
21544,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],And yield the glory yours.”—The steeds obey;
21545,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Already at their heels they wing their way,"
21546,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],And seem already to retrieve the day.
21547,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],
21548,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Meantime the Grecians in a ring beheld
21549,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],The coursers bounding o’er the dusty field.
21550,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],The first who mark’d them was the Cretan king;
21551,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"High on a rising ground, above the ring,"
21552,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],The monarch sat: from whence with sure survey
21553,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"He well observed the chief who led the way,"
21554,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"And heard from far his animating cries,"
21555,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],And saw the foremost steed with sharpen’d eyes;
21556,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"On whose broad front a blaze of shining white,"
21557,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Like the full moon, stood obvious to the sight."
21558,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"He saw; and rising, to the Greeks begun:"
21559,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],“Are yonder horse discern’d by me alone?
21560,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Or can ye, all, another chief survey,"
21561,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],And other steeds than lately led the way?
21562,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Those, though the swiftest, by some god withheld,"
21563,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Lie sure disabled in the middle field:
21564,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"For, since the goal they doubled, round the plain"
21565,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"I search to find them, but I search in vain."
21566,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Perchance the reins forsook the driver’s hand,"
21567,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"And, turn’d too short, he tumbled on the strand,"
21568,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Shot from the chariot; while his coursers stray
21569,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],With frantic fury from the destined way.
21570,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Rise then some other, and inform my sight,"
21571,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"For these dim eyes, perhaps, discern not right;"
21572,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Yet sure he seems, to judge by shape and air,"
21573,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"The great Ætolian chief, renown’d in war.”"
21574,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],
21575,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],“Old man! (Oïleus rashly thus replies)
21576,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Thy tongue too hastily confers the prize;

21830,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Officious with the cincture girds him round;
21831,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],And to his wrist the gloves of death are bound.
21832,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Amid the circle now each champion stands,"
21833,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],And poises high in air his iron hands;
21834,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"With clashing gauntlets now they fiercely close,"
21835,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Their crackling jaws re-echo to the blows,"
21836,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],And painful sweat from all their members flows.
21837,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],At length Epeus dealt a weighty blow
21838,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Full on the cheek of his unwary foe;
21839,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Beneath that ponderous arm’s resistless sway
21840,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Down dropp’d he, nerveless, and extended lay."
21841,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"As a large fish, when winds and waters roar,"
21842,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"By some huge billow dash’d against the shore,"
21843,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Lies panting; not less batter’d with his wound,"
21844,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],The bleeding hero pants upon the ground.
21845,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"To rear his fallen foe, the victor lends,"
21846,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Scornful, his hand; and gives him to his friends;"
21847,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Whose arms support him, reeling through the throng,"
21848,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],And dragging his disabled legs along;
21849,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Nodding, his head hangs down his shoulder o’er;"
21850,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],His mouth and nostrils pour the clotted gore;[292]
21851,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Wrapp’d round in mists he lies, and lost to thought;"
21852,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"His friends receive the bowl, too dearly bought."
21853,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],
21854,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"The third bold game Achilles next demands,"
21855,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],And calls the wrestlers to the level sands:
21856,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"A massy tripod for the victor lies,"
21857,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Of twice six oxen its reputed price;
21858,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"And next, the loser’s spirits to restore,"
21859,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"A female captive, valued but at four."
21860,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Scarce did the chief the vigorous strife propose
21861,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],When tower-like Ajax and Ulysses rose.
21862,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Amid the ring each nervous rival stands,"
21863,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Embracing rigid with implicit hands.
21864,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Close lock’d above, their heads and arms are mix’d:"
21865,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Below, their planted feet at distance fix’d;"
21866,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Like two strong rafters which the builder forms,"
21867,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Proof to the wintry winds and howling storms,"
21868,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Their tops connected, but at wider space"
21869,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Fix’d on the centre stands their solid base.
21870,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Now to the grasp each manly body bends;
21871,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],The humid sweat from every pore descends;
21872,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Their bones resound with blows: sides, shoulders, thighs"
21873,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Swell to each gripe, and bloody tumours rise."
21874,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Nor could Ulysses, for his art renown’d,"
21875,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],O’erturn the strength of Ajax on the ground;
21876,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Nor could the strength of Ajax overthrow
21877,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],The watchful caution of his artful foe.
21878,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"While the long strife even tired the lookers on,"
21879,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Thus to Ulysses spoke great Telamon:
21880,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"“Or let me lift thee, chief, or lift thou me:"
21881,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Prove we our force, and Jove the rest decree.”"
21882,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],
21883,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"He said; and, straining, heaved him off the ground"
21884,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],With matchless strength; that time Ulysses found
21885,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"The strength to evade, and where the nerves combine"
21886,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],His ankle struck: the giant fell supine;
21887,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Ulysses, following, on his bosom lies;"
21888,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Shouts of applause run rattling through the skies.
21889,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Ajax to lift Ulysses next essays;
21890,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"He barely stirr’d him, but he could not raise:"
21891,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"His knee lock’d fast, the foe’s attempt denied;"
21892,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"And grappling close, they tumbled side by side."
21893,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Defiled with honourable dust they roll,"
21894,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Still breathing strife, and unsubdued of soul:"
21895,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Again they rage, again to combat rise;"
21896,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],When great Achilles thus divides the prize:
21897,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],
21898,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"“Your noble vigour, O my friends, restrain;"
21899,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Nor weary out your generous strength in vain.
21900,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Ye both have won: let others who excel,"
21901,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Now prove that prowess you have proved so well.”
21902,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],
21903,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"The hero’s words the willing chiefs obey,"
21904,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"From their tired bodies wipe the dust away,"
21905,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"And, clothed anew, the following games survey."
21906,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],
21907,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],And now succeed the gifts ordain’d to grace
21908,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],The youths contending in the rapid race:
21909,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"A silver urn that full six measures held,"
21910,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],By none in weight or workmanship excell’d:
21911,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Sidonian artists taught the frame to shine,"
21912,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Elaborate, with artifice divine;"

21916,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"The glorious gift; and, for Lycaon spared,"
21917,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],To brave Patroclus gave the rich reward:
21918,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Now, the same hero’s funeral rites to grace,"
21919,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],It stands the prize of swiftness in the race.
21920,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],A well-fed ox was for the second placed;
21921,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],And half a talent must content the last.
21922,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Achilles rising then bespoke the train:
21923,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"“Who hope the palm of swiftness to obtain,"
21924,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Stand forth, and bear these prizes from the plain.”"
21925,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],
21926,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"The hero said, and starting from his place,"
21927,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Oilean Ajax rises to the race;
21928,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Ulysses next; and he whose speed surpass’d
21929,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"His youthful equals, Nestor’s son, the last."

21932,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],All start at once; Oïleus led the race;
21933,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"The next Ulysses, measuring pace with pace;"
21934,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Behind him, diligently close, he sped,"
21935,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],As closely following as the running thread
21936,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"The spindle follows, and displays the charms"
21937,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Of the fair spinster’s breast and moving arms:

21941,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],The admiring Greeks loud acclamations raise:
21942,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"To him they give their wishes, hearts, and eyes,"

21945,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],The panting chief to Pallas lifts his soul:
21946,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"“Assist, O goddess!” thus in thought he pray’d!"
21947,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],And present at his thought descends the maid.
21948,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Buoy’d by her heavenly force, he seems to swim,"
21949,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],And feels a pinion lifting every limb.
21950,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"All fierce, and ready now the prize to gain,"
21951,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Unhappy Ajax stumbles on the plain

21980,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],Achilles only boasts a swifter pace:
21981,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"For who can match Achilles? He who can,"
21982,FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280],"Must yet be more than hero, more than man.”"

22805,THE REDEMPTION OF THE BODY OF HECTOR.,"Each look’d on other, none the silence broke,"
22806,THE REDEMPTION OF THE BODY OF HECTOR.,Till thus at last the kingly suppliant spoke:

23498,"275, A.","[25] It is, indeed not easy to calculate the height to which the"
23499,"275, A.","memory may be cultivated. To take an ordinary case, we might refer to"
23500,"275, A.","that of any first rate actor, who must be prepared, at a very short"
23501,"275, A.","warning, to ‘rhapsodize,’ night after night, parts which when laid"
23502,"275, A.","together, would amount to an immense number of lines. But all this is"
23503,"275, A.",nothing to two instances of our own day. Visiting at Naples a
23504,"275, A.","gentleman of the highest intellectual attainments, and who held a"
23505,"275, A.","distinguished rank among the men of letters in the last century, he"
23506,"275, A.",informed us that the day before he had passed much time in examining a
23507,"275, A.","man, not highly educated, who had learned to repeat the whole"
23508,"275, A.","Gierusalemme of Tasso, not only to recite it consecutively, but also"
23509,"275, A.","to repeat those stanzas in utter defiance of the sense, either"
23510,"275, A.","forwards or backwards, or from the eighth line to the first,"
23511,"275, A.","alternately the odd and even lines—in short, whatever the passage"
23512,"275, A.","required; the memory, which seemed to cling to the words much more"
23513,"275, A.","than to the sense, had it at such perfect command, that it could"
23514,"275, A.",produce it under any form. Our informant went on to state that this
23515,"275, A.",singular being was proceeding to learn the Orlando Furioso in the same
23516,"275, A.",manner. But even this instance is less wonderful than one as to which
23517,"275, A.",we may appeal to any of our readers that happened some twenty years
23518,"275, A.","ago to visit the town of Stirling, in Scotland. No such person can"
23519,"275, A.","have forgotten the poor, uneducated man Blind Jamie who could actually"
23520,"275, A.","repeat, after a few minutes consideration any verse required from any"
23521,"275, A.",part of the Bible—even the obscurest and most unimportant enumeration
23522,"275, A.",of mere proper names not excepted. We do not mention these facts as
23523,"275, A.","touching the more difficult part of the question before us, but facts"
23524,"275, A.",they are; and if we find so much difficulty in calculating the extent
23525,"275, A.","to which the mere memory may be cultivated, are we, in these days of"

23578,"275, A.","particulars, is translated from Bitaubé, and is, perhaps, the neatest"
23579,"275, A.","summary that has ever been drawn up:—“A hero, injured by his general,"
23580,"275, A.","and animated with a noble resentment, retires to his tent; and for a"
23581,"275, A.",season withdraws himself and his troops from the war. During this
23582,"275, A.","interval, victory abandons the army, which for nine years has been"
23583,"275, A.","occupied in a great enterprise, upon the successful termination of"
23584,"275, A.","which the honour of their country depends. The general, at length"
23585,"275, A.","opening his eyes to the fault which he had committed, deputes the"
23586,"275, A.","principal officers of his army to the incensed hero, with commission"
23587,"275, A.","to make compensation for the injury, and to tender magnificent"
23588,"275, A.","presents. The hero, according to the proud obstinacy of his character,"
23589,"275, A.","persists in his animosity; the army is again defeated, and is on the"
23590,"275, A.",verge of entire destruction. This inexorable man has a friend; this
23591,"275, A.","friend weeps before him, and asks for the hero’s arms, and for"
23592,"275, A.",permission to go to the war in his stead. The eloquence of friendship
23593,"275, A.",prevails more than the intercession of the ambassadors or the gifts of
23594,"275, A.","the general. He lends his armour to his friend, but commands him not"
23595,"275, A.","to engage with the chief of the enemy’s army, because he reserves to"
23596,"275, A.","himself the honour of that combat, and because he also fears for his"
23597,"275, A.",friend’s life. The prohibition is forgotten; the friend listens to
23598,"275, A.","nothing but his courage; his corpse is brought back to the hero, and"
23599,"275, A.","the hero’s arms become the prize of the conqueror. Then the hero,"
23600,"275, A.","given up to the most lively despair, prepares to fight; he receives"
23601,"275, A.","from a divinity new armour, is reconciled with his general and,"
23602,"275, A.","thirsting for glory and revenge, enacts prodigies of valour, recovers"
23603,"275, A.","the victory, slays the enemy’s chief, honours his friend with superb"
23604,"275, A.","funeral rites, and exercises a cruel vengeance on the body of his"
23605,"275, A.",destroyer; but finally appeased by the tears and prayers of the father
23606,"275, A.","of the slain warrior, restores to the old man the corpse of his son,"
23607,"275, A.","which he buries with due solemnities.’—Coleridge, p. 177, sqq."

23763,"275, A.","ship so often represented on Egyptian monuments, and the return of the"
23764,"275, A.","deity from Ethiopia after some days’ absence, serves to show the"
23765,"275, A.","Ethiopian origin of Thebes, and of the worship of Jupiter Ammon. “I"
23766,"275, A.","think,” says Heeren, after quoting a passage from Diodorus about the"
23767,"275, A.","holy ship, “that this procession is represented in one of the great"

23934,"275, A.",[86] This sentiment used to be a popular one with some of the greatest
23935,"275, A.","tyrants, who abused it into a pretext for unlimited usurpation of"

23941,"275, A.","[87] It may be remarked, that the character of Thersites, revolting"
23942,"275, A.","and contemptible as it is, serves admirably to develop the disposition"
23943,"275, A.","of Ulysses in a new light, in which mere cunning is less prominent. Of"
23944,"275, A.","the gradual and individual development of Homer’s heroes, Schlegel"
23945,"275, A.","well observes, “In bas-relief the figures are usually in profile, and"
23946,"275, A.",in the epos all are characterized in the simplest manner in relief;
23947,"275, A.","they are not grouped together, but follow one another; so Homer’s"
23948,"275, A.","heroes advance, one by one, in succession before us. It has been"
23949,"275, A.","remarked that the _Iliad_ is not definitively closed, but that we are"
23950,"275, A.",left to suppose something both to precede and to follow it. The
23951,"275, A.","bas-relief is equally without limit, and may be continued _ad"
23952,"275, A.","infinitum_, either from before or behind, on which account the"
23953,"275, A.",ancients preferred for it such subjects as admitted of an indefinite
23954,"275, A.","extension, sacrificial processions, dances, and lines of combatants,"
23955,"275, A.","and hence they also exhibit bas-reliefs on curved surfaces, such as"
23956,"275, A.","vases, or the frieze of a rotunda, where, by the curvature, the two"
23957,"275, A.","ends are withdrawn from our sight, and where, while we advance, one"
23958,"275, A.",object appears as another disappears. Reading Homer is very much like
23959,"275, A.","such a circuit; the present object alone arresting our attention, we"
23960,"275, A.","lose sight of what precedes, and do not concern ourselves about what"
23961,"275, A.","is to follow.”—“Dramatic Literature,” p. 75."
23962,"275, A.",
23963,"275, A.",[88] “There cannot be a clearer indication than this description —so
23964,"275, A.",graphic in the original poem—of the true character of the Homeric
23965,"275, A.","agora. The multitude who compose it are listening and acquiescent, not"
23966,"275, A.","often hesitating, and never refractory to the chief. The fate which"
23967,"275, A.","awaits a presumptuous critic, even where his virulent reproaches are"
23968,"275, A.","substantially well-founded, is plainly set forth in the treatment of"
23969,"275, A.",Thersites; while the unpopularity of such a character is attested even
23970,"275, A.",more by the excessive pains which Homer takes to heap upon him
23971,"275, A.","repulsive personal deformities, than by the chastisement of Odysseus"
23972,"275, A.","he is lame, bald, crook-backed, of misshapen head, and squinting"

23989,"275, A.","“Particular animals were, at a later time, consecrated to particular"
23990,"275, A.","deities. To Jupiter, Ceres, Juno, Apollo, and Bacchus victims of"

23992,"275, A.","especially acceptable to Jupiter. A black bull, a ram, or a boar pig,"
23993,"275, A.","were offerings for Neptune. A heifer, or a sheep, for Minerva. To"
23994,"275, A.","Ceres a sow was sacrificed, as an enemy to corn. The goat to Bacchus,"
23995,"275, A.",because he fed on vines. Diana was propitiated with a stag; and to
23996,"275, A.",Venus the dove was consecrated. The infernal and evil deities were to
23997,"275, A.",be appeased with black victims. The most acceptable of all sacrifices
23998,"275, A.","was the heifer of a year old, which had never borne the yoke. It was"
23999,"275, A.","to be perfect in every limb, healthy, and without blemish.”—“Elgin"

25087,"275, A.","“One of the noblest and most amiable sides of the Greek character,"
25088,"275, A.",is the readiness with which it lent itself to construct intimate
25089,"275, A.","and durable friendships, and this is a feature no less prominent in"
25090,"275, A.",the earliest than in later times. It was indeed connected with the
25091,"275, A.",comparatively low estimation in which female society was held; but
25092,"275, A.",the devotedness and constancy with which these attachments were
25093,"275, A.","maintained, was not the less admirable and engaging. The heroic"
25094,"275, A.",companions whom we find celebrated partly by Homer and partly in
25095,"275, A.","traditions which, if not of equal antiquity, were grounded on the"
25096,"275, A.","same feeling, seem to have but one heart and soul, with scarcely a"
25097,"275, A.","wish or object apart, and only to live as they are always ready to"
25098,"275, A.",die for one another. It is true that the relation between them is
25099,"275, A.",not always one of perfect equality; but this is a circumstance
25100,"275, A.","which, while it often adds a peculiar charm to the poetical"
25101,"275, A.","description, detracts little from the dignity of the idea which it"
25102,"275, A.","presents. Such were the friendships of Hercules and Iolaus, of"
25103,"275, A.","Theseus and Pirithous, of Orestes and Pylades; and though These may"
25104,"275, A.",owe the greater part of their fame to the later epic or even
25105,"275, A.","dramatic poetry, the moral groundwork undoubtedly subsisted in the"
25106,"275, A.",period to which the traditions are referred. The argument of the
25107,"275, A.","Iliad mainly turns on the affection of Achilles for Patroclus,"
25108,"275, A.",whose love for the greater hero is only tempered by reverence for
25109,"275, A.",his higher birth and his unequalled prowess. But the mutual regard
25110,"275, A.","which united Idomeneus and Meriones, Diomedes and Sthenelus,"
25111,"275, A.","though, as the persons themselves are less important, it is kept"
25112,"275, A.","more in the back-ground, is manifestly viewed by the poet in the"
25113,"275, A.",same light. The idea of a Greek hero seems not to have been thought
25114,"275, A.","complete, without such a brother in arms by his side.”—Thirlwall,"

25127,"275, A.","purely Pagan as it is, we discover one important truth unconsciously"
25128,"275, A.","involved, which was almost entirely lost from view amidst the nearly"
25129,"275, A.",equal scepticism and credulity of subsequent ages. Zeus or Jupiter is
25130,"275, A.",popularly to be taken as omnipotent. No distinct empire is assigned to
25131,"275, A.",fate or fortune; the will of the father of gods and men is absolute
25132,"275, A.",and uncontrollable. This seems to be the true character of the Homeric
25133,"275, A.","deity, and it is very necessary that the student of Greek literature"
25134,"275, A.",should bear it constantly in mind. A strong instance in the Iliad
25135,"275, A.","itself to illustrate this position, is the passage where Jupiter"
25136,"275, A.",laments to Juno the approaching death of Sarpedon. ‘Alas me!’ says he
25137,"275, A.","‘since it is fated (moira) that Sarpedon, dearest to me of men, should"
25138,"275, A.","be slain by Patroclus, the son of Menoetius! Indeed, my heart is"
25139,"275, A.","divided within me while I ruminate it in my mind, whether having"
25140,"275, A.","snatched him up from out of the lamentable battle, I should not at"
25141,"275, A.","once place him alive in the fertile land of his own Lycia, or whether"
25142,"275, A.",I should now destroy him by the hands of the son of Menoetius!’ To
25143,"275, A.","which Juno answers—‘Dost thou mean to rescue from death a mortal man,"
25144,"275, A.","long since destined by fate (palai pepromenon)? You may do it—but we,"
25145,"275, A.","the rest of the gods, do not sanction it.’ Here it is clear from both"
25146,"275, A.","speakers, that although Sarpedon is said to be fated to die, Jupiter"
25147,"275, A.","might still, if he pleased, save him, and place him entirely out of"
25148,"275, A.","the reach of any such event, and further, in the alternative, that"

25271,"275, A.",compared this with the description of the shield of Hercules by
25272,"275, A.","Hesiod. He remarks that, “with two or three exceptions, the imagery"
25273,"275, A.",differs in little more than the names and arrangements; and the
25274,"275, A.",difference of arrangement in the Shield of Hercules is altogether for
25275,"275, A.",the worse. The natural consecution of the Homeric images needs no
25276,"275, A.",exposition: it constitutes in itself one of the beauties of the work.
25277,"275, A.",The Hesiodic images are huddled together without connection or
25278,"275, A.",congruity: Mars and Pallas are awkwardly introduced among the Centaurs
25279,"275, A.",and Lapithae;— but the gap is wide indeed between them and Apollo with
25280,"275, A.","the Muses, waking the echoes of Olympus to celestial harmonies; whence"
25281,"275, A.","however, we are hurried back to Perseus, the Gorgons, and other images"

25283,"275, A.","fugitive fishes, and the fisherman on the shore with his casting net,"
25284,"275, A.","are minutely represented. As to the Hesiodic images themselves, the"
25285,"275, A.","leading remark is, that they catch at beauty by ornament, and at"
25286,"275, A.",sublimity by exaggeration; and upon the untenable supposition of the
25287,"275, A.","genuineness of this poem, there is this curious peculiarity, that, in"
25288,"275, A.","the description of scenes of rustic peace, the superiority of Homer is"
25289,"275, A.","decisive—while in those of war and tumult it may be thought, perhaps,"

25573,"275, A.",With rapid force they bear him down the skies

25584,"275, A.","[295] In reference to the whole scene that follows, the remarks of"
25585,"275, A.",Coleridge are well worth reading:—
25586,"275, A.","“By a close study of life, and by a true and natural mode of"
25587,"275, A.","expressing everything, Homer was enabled to venture upon the most"
25588,"275, A.","peculiar and difficult situations, and to extricate himself from"
25589,"275, A.",them with the completest success. The whole scene between Achilles
25590,"275, A.","and Priam, when the latter comes to the Greek camp for the purpose"
25591,"275, A.","of redeeming the body of Hector, is at once the most profoundly"
25592,"275, A.","skilful, and yet the simplest and most affecting passage in the"
25593,"275, A.",Iliad. Quinctilian has taken notice of the following speech of
25594,"275, A.","Priam, the rhetorical artifice of which is so transcendent, that if"
25595,"275, A.","genius did not often, especially in oratory, unconsciously fulfil"
25596,"275, A.","the most subtle precepts of criticism, we might be induced, on this"
25597,"275, A.","account alone, to consider the last book of the Iliad as what is"
25598,"275, A.","called spurious, in other words, of later date than the rest of the"
25599,"275, A.",poem. Observe the exquisite taste of Priam in occupying the mind of
25600,"275, A.","Achilles, from the outset, with the image of his father; in"
25601,"275, A.","gradually introducing the parallel of his own situation; and,"
25602,"275, A.","lastly, mentioning Hector’s name when he perceives that the hero is"
25603,"275, A.","softened, and then only in such a manner as to flatter the pride of"
25604,"275, A.","the conqueror. The ego d’eleeinoteros per, and the apusato aecha"
25605,"275, A.","geronta, are not exactly like the tone of the earlier parts of the"
25606,"275, A.",Iliad. They are almost too fine and pathetic. The whole passage
25607,"275, A.","defies translation, for there is that about the Greek which has no"
25608,"275, A.","name, but which is of so fine and ethereal a subtlety that it can"
25609,"275, A.","only be felt in the original, and is lost in an attempt to"
25610,"275, A.","transfuse it into another language.”—Coleridge, p. 195."
25611,"275, A.",
25612,"275, A.",[296] “Achilles’ ferocious treatment of the corpse of Hector cannot
25613,"275, A.",but offend as referred to the modern standard of humanity. The heroic
25614,"275, A.","age, however, must be judged by its own moral laws. Retributive"
25615,"275, A.","vengeance on the dead, as well as the living, was a duty inculcated by"
25616,"275, A.",the religion of those barbarous times which not only taught that evil
25617,"275, A.",inflicted on the author of evil was a solace to the injured man; but
25618,"275, A.",made the welfare of the soul after death dependent on the fate of the
25619,"275, A.",body from which it had separated. Hence a denial of the rites
25620,"275, A.",essential to the soul’s admission into the more favoured regions of
25621,"275, A.",the lower world was a cruel punishment to the wanderer on the dreary
25622,"275, A.",shores of the infernal river. The complaint of the ghost of Patroclus
25623,"275, A.","to Achilles, of but a brief postponement of his own obsequies, shows"
25624,"275, A.",how efficacious their refusal to the remains of his destroyer must
25625,"275, A.","have been in satiating the thirst of revenge, which, even after death,"
25626,"275, A.",was supposed to torment the dwellers in Hades. Hence before yielding
25627,"275, A.","up the body of Hector to Priam, Achilles asks pardon of Patroclus for"
25628,"275, A.","even this partial cession of his just rights of retribution.”—Mure,"

25638,"275, A.",[298] The following observations of Coleridge furnish a most gallant
25639,"275, A.",and interesting view of Helen’s character—
25640,"275, A.",“Few things are more interesting than to observe how the same hand
25641,"275, A.","that has given us the fury and inconsistency of Achilles, gives us"
25642,"275, A.",also the consummate elegance and tenderness of Helen. She is
25643,"275, A.","through the Iliad a genuine lady, graceful in motion and speech,"
25644,"275, A.","noble in her associations, full of remorse for a fault for which"
25645,"275, A.","higher powers seem responsible, yet grateful and affectionate"
25646,"275, A.",towards those with whom that fault had committed her. I have always
25647,"275, A.","thought the following speech in which Helen laments Hector, and"
25648,"275, A.","hints at her own invidious and unprotected situation in Troy, as"
25649,"275, A.",almost the sweetest passage in the poem. It is another striking
25650,"275, A.",instance of that refinement of feeling and softness of tone which
25651,"275, A.",so generally distinguish the last book of the Iliad from the
25652,"275, A.","rest.”—Classic Poets, p. 198, seq."
25653,"275, A.",
25654,"275, A.",[299] “And here we part with Achilles at the moment best calculated to
25655,"275, A.",exalt and purify our impression of his character. We had accompanied
25656,"275, A.","him through the effervescence, undulations, and final subsidence of"
25657,"275, A.",his stormy passions. We now leave him in repose and under the full
25658,"275, A.","influence of the more amiable affections, while our admiration of his"
25659,"275, A.","great qualities is chastened by the reflection that, within a few"
25660,"275, A.",short days the mighty being in whom they were united was himself to be
25661,"275, A.",suddenly cut off in the full vigour of their exercise.
25662,"275, A.","The frequent and touching allusions, interspersed throughout the"
25663,"275, A.","Iliad, to the speedy termination of its hero’s course, and the"
25664,"275, A.","moral on the vanity of human life which they indicate, are among"
25665,"275, A.",the finest evidences of the spirit of ethic unity by which the
25666,"275, A.","whole framework of the poem is united.”—Mure, vol. i. p 201."
25667,"275, A.",
25668,"275, A.","[300] Cowper says,—“I cannot take my leave of this noble poem without"
25669,"275, A.",expressing how much I am struck with the plain conclusion of it. It is
25670,"275, A.","like the exit of a great man out of company, whom he has entertained"
25671,"275, A.","magnificently; neither pompous nor familiar; not contemptuous, yet"
25672,"275, A.","without much ceremony.” Coleridge, p. 227, considers the termination"
25673,"275, A.",of “Paradise Lost” somewhat similar.
