67,PREFATORY NOTE.,The execution of this version of the _Iliad_ has been entrusted to the
68,PREFATORY NOTE.,three Translators in the following three parts:
69,PREFATORY NOTE.,
70,PREFATORY NOTE.,Books I.—IX. . . . . W. LEAF.
71,PREFATORY NOTE.,Books X.—XVI. . . . . A. LANG.
72,PREFATORY NOTE.,Books XVII.—XXIV. . . . . E. MYERS.
73,PREFATORY NOTE.,
74,PREFATORY NOTE.,
75,PREFATORY NOTE.,Each Translator is therefore responsible for his own portion; but the
76,PREFATORY NOTE.,"whole has been revised by all three Translators, and the rendering of"
77,PREFATORY NOTE.,passages or phrases recurring in more than one portion has been
78,PREFATORY NOTE.,"determined after deliberation in common. Even in these, however, a"
79,PREFATORY NOTE.,certain elasticity has been deemed desirable.
80,PREFATORY NOTE.,
81,PREFATORY NOTE.,"On a few doubtful points, though very rarely, the opinion of two of the"
82,PREFATORY NOTE.,translators has had to be adopted to the suppression of that held by
83,PREFATORY NOTE.,"the third. Thus, for instance, the Translator of Books X.—XVI. Would"
84,PREFATORY NOTE.,have preferred “c” and “us” to “k” and “os” in the spelling of all
85,PREFATORY NOTE.,proper names.
86,PREFATORY NOTE.,
87,PREFATORY NOTE.,"The text followed has been that of La Roche (Leipzig, 1873), except"
88,PREFATORY NOTE.,where the adoption of a different reading has been specified in a
89,PREFATORY NOTE.,"footnote. Where the balance of evidence, external and internal, has"
90,PREFATORY NOTE.,"seemed to the Translator to be against the genuineness of the passage,"
91,PREFATORY NOTE.,such passage has been enclosed in brackets [].
92,PREFATORY NOTE.,
93,PREFATORY NOTE.,"The Translator of Books X.—XVI. has to thank Mr. R.W. RAPER, Fellow of"
94,PREFATORY NOTE.,"Trinity College, Oxford, for his valuable aid in revising the"
95,PREFATORY NOTE.,proof-sheets of these Books.

99,NOTE TO REVISED EDITION,In the present Edition the translation has been carefully revised
100,NOTE TO REVISED EDITION,"throughout, and numerous minor corrections have been made. The Notes at"
101,NOTE TO REVISED EDITION,"the end of the volume have been, with a few exceptions, omitted; one of"
102,NOTE TO REVISED EDITION,the Translators hopes to publish very shortly a Companion to the Iliad
103,NOTE TO REVISED EDITION,"for English readers, which will deal fully with most of the points"
104,NOTE TO REVISED EDITION,therein referred to.
105,NOTE TO REVISED EDITION,
106,NOTE TO REVISED EDITION,The use of square brackets has in this edition been restricted to
107,NOTE TO REVISED EDITION,"passages where there is external evidence, such as absence from the"
108,NOTE TO REVISED EDITION,"best MSS., for believing in interpolation. One or two departures from"
109,NOTE TO REVISED EDITION,this rule are noticed in footnotes.

162,BOOK I.,
163,BOOK I.,
164,BOOK I.,How Agamemnon and Achilles fell out at the siege of Troy; and Achilles
165,BOOK I.,"withdrew himself from battle, and won from Zeus a pledge that his wrong"
166,BOOK I.,should be avenged on Agamemnon and the Achaians.
167,BOOK I.,
168,BOOK I.,
169,BOOK I.,"Sing, goddess, the wrath of Achilles Peleus’ son, the ruinous wrath"
170,BOOK I.,"that brought on the Achaians woes innumerable, and hurled down into"
171,BOOK I.,"Hades many strong souls of heroes, and gave their bodies to be a prey"
172,BOOK I.,to dogs and all winged fowls; and so the counsel of Zeus wrought out
173,BOOK I.,its accomplishment from the day when first strife parted Atreides king
174,BOOK I.,of men and noble Achilles.
175,BOOK I.,
176,BOOK I.,Who then among the gods set the twain at strife and variance? Even the
177,BOOK I.,son of Leto and of Zeus; for he in anger at the king sent a sore plague
178,BOOK I.,"upon the host, that the folk began to perish, because Atreides had done"
179,BOOK I.,dishonour to Chryses the priest. For he had come to the Achaians’ fleet
180,BOOK I.,"ships to win his daughter’s freedom, and brought a ransom beyond"
181,BOOK I.,telling; and bare in his hands the fillet of Apollo the Far-darter upon
182,BOOK I.,"a golden staff; and made his prayer unto all the Achaians, and most of"
183,BOOK I.,"all to the two sons of Atreus, orderers of the host: “Ye sons of Atreus"
184,BOOK I.,"and all ye well-greaved Achaians, now may the gods that dwell in the"
185,BOOK I.,"mansions of Olympus grant you to lay waste the city of Priam, and to"
186,BOOK I.,"fare happily homeward; only set ye my dear child free, and accept the"
187,BOOK I.,"ransom in reverence to the son of Zeus, far-darting Apollo.”"
188,BOOK I.,
189,BOOK I.,"Then all the other Achaians cried assent, to reverence the priest and"
190,BOOK I.,accept his goodly ransom; yet the thing pleased not the heart of
191,BOOK I.,"Agamemnon son of Atreus, but he roughly sent him away, and laid stern"
192,BOOK I.,"charge upon him, saying: “Let me not find thee, old man, amid the"
193,BOOK I.,"hollow ships, whether tarrying now or returning again hereafter, lest"
194,BOOK I.,the staff and fillet of the god avail thee naught. And her will I not
195,BOOK I.,"set free; nay, ere that shall old age come on her in our house, in"
196,BOOK I.,"Argos, far from her native land, where she shall ply the loom and serve"
197,BOOK I.,"my couch. But depart, provoke me not, that thou mayest the rather go in"
198,BOOK I.,peace.”
199,BOOK I.,
200,BOOK I.,"So said he, and the old man was afraid and obeyed his word, and fared"
201,BOOK I.,silently along the shore of the loud-sounding sea. Then went that aged
202,BOOK I.,"man apart and prayed aloud to king Apollo, whom Leto of the fair locks"
203,BOOK I.,"bare: “Hear me, god of the silver bow, that standest over Chryse and"
204,BOOK I.,"holy Killa, and rulest Tenedos with might, O Smintheus! If ever I built"
205,BOOK I.,"a temple gracious in thine eyes, or if ever I burnt to thee fat flesh"
206,BOOK I.,"of thighs of bulls or goats, fulfil thou this my desire; let the"
207,BOOK I.,Danaans pay by thine arrows for my tears.”
208,BOOK I.,
209,BOOK I.,"So spake he in prayer, and Phoebus Apollo heard him, and came down from"
210,BOOK I.,"the peaks of Olympus wroth at heart, bearing on his shoulders his bow"
211,BOOK I.,"and covered quiver. And the arrows clanged upon his shoulders in wrath,"
212,BOOK I.,as the god moved; and he descended like to night. Then he sate him
213,BOOK I.,"aloof from the ships, and let an arrow fly; and there was heard a dread"
214,BOOK I.,clanging of the silver bow. First did he assail the mules and fleet
215,BOOK I.,"dogs, but afterward, aiming at the men his piercing dart, he smote; and"
216,BOOK I.,the pyres of the dead burnt continually in multitude.
217,BOOK I.,
218,BOOK I.,Now for nine days ranged the god’s shafts through the host; but on the
219,BOOK I.,"tenth Achilles summoned the folk to assembly, for in his mind did"
220,BOOK I.,"goddess Hera of the white arms put the thought, because she had pity on"
221,BOOK I.,the Danaans when she beheld them perishing. Now when they had gathered
222,BOOK I.,"and were met in assembly, then Achilles fleet of foot stood up and"
223,BOOK I.,"spake among them: “Son of Atreus, now deem I that we shall return"
224,BOOK I.,wandering home again—if verily we might escape death—if war at once and
225,BOOK I.,"pestilence must indeed ravage the Achaians. But come, let us now"
226,BOOK I.,"inquire of some soothsayer or priest, yea, or an interpreter of"
227,BOOK I.,dreams—seeing that a dream too is of Zeus—who shall say wherefore
228,BOOK I.,"Phoebus Apollo is so wroth, whether he blame us by reason of vow or"
229,BOOK I.,hecatomb; if perchance he would accept the savour of lambs or
230,BOOK I.,"unblemished goats, and so would take away the pestilence from us.”"
231,BOOK I.,
232,BOOK I.,So spake he and sate him down; and there stood up before them Kalchas
233,BOOK I.,"son of Thestor, most excellent far of augurs, who knew both things that"
234,BOOK I.,"were and that should be and that had been before, and guided the ships"
235,BOOK I.,of the Achaians to Ilios by his soothsaying that Phoebus Apollo
236,BOOK I.,bestowed on him. He of good intent made harangue and spake amid them:
237,BOOK I.,"“Achilles, dear to Zeus, thou biddest me tell the wrath of Apollo, the"
238,BOOK I.,king that smiteth afar. Therefore will I speak; but do thou make
239,BOOK I.,"covenant with me, and swear that verily with all thy heart thou wilt"
240,BOOK I.,aid me both by word and deed. For of a truth I deem that I shall
241,BOOK I.,"provoke one that ruleth all the Argives with might, and whom the"
242,BOOK I.,Achaians obey. For a king is more of might when he is wroth with a
243,BOOK I.,"meaner man; even though for the one day he swallow his anger, yet doth"
244,BOOK I.,he still keep his displeasure thereafter in his breast till he
245,BOOK I.,"accomplish it. Consider thou, then, if thou wilt hold me safe.”"
246,BOOK I.,
247,BOOK I.,"And Achilles fleet of foot made answer and spake to him: “Yea, be of"
248,BOOK I.,"good courage, speak whatever soothsaying thou knowest; for by Apollo"
249,BOOK I.,"dear to Zeus, him by whose worship thou, O Kalchas, declarest thy"
250,BOOK I.,"soothsaying to the Danaans, no man while I live and behold light on"
251,BOOK I.,"earth shall lay violent hands upon thee amid the hollow ships, no man"
252,BOOK I.,"of all the Danaans, not even if thou mean Agamemnon, that now avoweth"
253,BOOK I.,him to be greatest far of the Achaians.”
254,BOOK I.,
255,BOOK I.,"Then was the noble seer of good courage, and spake: “Neither by reason"
256,BOOK I.,"of a vow is he displeased, nor for any hecatomb, but for his priest’s"
257,BOOK I.,"sake to whom Agamemnon did despite, and set not his daughter free and"
258,BOOK I.,accepted not the ransom; therefore hath the Far-darter brought woes
259,BOOK I.,"upon us, yea, and will bring. Nor will he ever remove the loathly"
260,BOOK I.,pestilence from the Danaans till we have given the bright-eyed damsel
261,BOOK I.,"to her father, unbought, unransomed, and carried a holy hecatomb to"
262,BOOK I.,Chryse; then might we propitiate him to our prayer.”
263,BOOK I.,
264,BOOK I.,"So said he and sate him down, and there stood up before them the hero"
265,BOOK I.,"son of Atreus, wide-ruling Agamemnon, sore displeased; and his dark"
266,BOOK I.,"heart within him was greatly filled with anger, and his eyes were like"
267,BOOK I.,flashing fire. To Kalchas first spake he with look of ill: “Thou seer
268,BOOK I.,"of evil, never yet hast thou told me the thing that is pleasant. Evil"
269,BOOK I.,"is ever the joy of thy heart to prophesy, but never yet didst thou tell"
270,BOOK I.,any good matter nor bring to pass. And now with soothsaying thou makest
271,BOOK I.,"harangue among the Danaans, how that the Far-darter bringeth woes upon"
272,BOOK I.,"them because, forsooth, I would not take the goodly ransom of the"
273,BOOK I.,"damsel Chryseis, seeing I am the rather fain to keep her own self"
274,BOOK I.,"within mine house. Yea, I prefer her before Klytaimnestra my wedded"
275,BOOK I.,"wife; in no wise is she lacking beside her, neither in favour nor"
276,BOOK I.,"stature, nor wit nor skill. Yet for all this will I give her back, if"
277,BOOK I.,that is better; rather would I see my folk whole than perishing. Only
278,BOOK I.,"make ye me ready a prize of honour forthwith, lest I alone of all the"
279,BOOK I.,"Argives be disprized, which thing beseemeth not; for ye all behold how"
280,BOOK I.,my prize is departing from me.”
281,BOOK I.,
282,BOOK I.,To him then made answer fleet-footed goodly Achilles: “Most noble son
283,BOOK I.,"of Atreus, of all men most covetous, how shall the great-hearted"
284,BOOK I.,Achaians give thee a meed of honour? We know naught of any wealth of
285,BOOK I.,"common store, but what spoil soe’er we took from captured cities hath"
286,BOOK I.,"been apportioned, and it beseemeth not to beg all this back from the"
287,BOOK I.,"folk. Nay, yield thou the damsel to the god, and we Achaians will pay"
288,BOOK I.,"thee back threefold and fourfold, if ever Zeus grant us to sack some"
289,BOOK I.,well-walled town of Troy-land.”*
290,BOOK I.,
291,BOOK I.,Reading with Cobet Τρῳήν for Τροίην.
292,BOOK I.,
293,BOOK I.,
294,BOOK I.,"To him lord Agamemnon made answer and said: “Not in this wise, strong"
295,BOOK I.,"as thou art, O godlike Achilles, beguile thou me by craft; thou shalt"
296,BOOK I.,"not outwit me nor persuade me. Dost thou wish, that thou mayest keep"
297,BOOK I.,"thy meed of honour, for me to sit idle in bereavement, and biddest me"
298,BOOK I.,"give her back? Nay, if the great-hearted Achaians will give me a meed"
299,BOOK I.,"suited to my mind, that the recompense be equal—but if they give it"
300,BOOK I.,"not, then I myself will go and take a meed of honour, thine be it or"
301,BOOK I.,"Aias’, or Odysseus’ that I will take unto me; wroth shall he be to"
302,BOOK I.,whomsoever I come. But for this we will take counsel hereafter; now let
303,BOOK I.,"us launch a black ship on the great sea, and gather picked oarsmen, and"
304,BOOK I.,"set therein a hecatomb, and embark Chryseis of the fair cheeks herself,"
305,BOOK I.,"and let one of our counsellors be captain, Aias or Idomeneus or goodly"
306,BOOK I.,"Odysseus, or thou, Peleides, most redoubtable of men, to do sacrifice"
307,BOOK I.,for us and propitiate the Far-darter.”
308,BOOK I.,
309,BOOK I.,"Then Achilles fleet of foot looked at him scowling and said: “Ah me,"
310,BOOK I.,"thou clothed in shamelessness, thou of crafty mind, how shall any"
311,BOOK I.,"Achaian hearken to thy bidding with all his heart, be it to go a"
312,BOOK I.,journey or to fight the foe amain? Not by reason of the Trojan spearmen
313,BOOK I.,"came I hither to fight, for they have not wronged me; never did they"
314,BOOK I.,"harry mine oxen nor my horses, nor ever waste my harvest in deep-soiled"
315,BOOK I.,"Phthia, the nurse of men; seeing there lieth between us long space of"
316,BOOK I.,"shadowy mountains and sounding sea; but thee, thou shameless one,"
317,BOOK I.,"followed we hither to make thee glad, by earning recompense at the"
318,BOOK I.,"Trojans’ hands for Menelaos and for thee, thou dog-face! All this thou"
319,BOOK I.,"threatenest thyself to take my meed of honour, wherefor I travailed"
320,BOOK I.,"much, and the sons of the Achaians gave it me. Never win I meed like"
321,BOOK I.,"unto thine, when the Achaians sack any populous citadel of Trojan men;"
322,BOOK I.,"my hands bear the brunt of furious war, but when the apportioning"
323,BOOK I.,"cometh then is thy meed far ampler, and I betake me to the ships with"
324,BOOK I.,"some small thing, yet mine own, when I have fought to weariness. Now"
325,BOOK I.,"will I depart to Phthia, seeing it is far better to return home on my"
326,BOOK I.,beaked ships; nor am I minded here in dishonour to draw thee thy fill
327,BOOK I.,of riches and wealth.”
328,BOOK I.,
329,BOOK I.,"Then Agamemnon king of men made answer to him “Yea, flee, if thy soul"
330,BOOK I.,be set thereon. It is not I that beseech thee to tarry for my sake; I
331,BOOK I.,"have others by my side that shall do me honour, and above all Zeus,"
332,BOOK I.,"lord of counsel. Most hateful art thou to me of all kings, fosterlings"
333,BOOK I.,of Zeus; thou ever lovest strife and wars and fightings. Though thou be
334,BOOK I.,"very strong, yet that I ween is a gift to thee of God. Go home with thy"
335,BOOK I.,ships and company and lord it among thy Myrmidons; I reck not aught of
336,BOOK I.,thee nor care I for thine indignation; and all this shall be my threat
337,BOOK I.,"to thee: seeing Phoebus Apollo bereaveth me of Chryseis, her with my"
338,BOOK I.,ship and my company will I send back; and mine own self will I go to
339,BOOK I.,"thy hut and take Briseis of the fair cheeks, even that thy meed of"
340,BOOK I.,"honour, that thou mayest well know how far greater I am than thou, and"
341,BOOK I.,so shall another hereafter abhor to match his words with mine and rival
342,BOOK I.,me to my face.”
343,BOOK I.,
344,BOOK I.,"So said he, and grief came upon Peleus’ son, and his heart within his"
345,BOOK I.,"shaggy breast was divided in counsel, whether to draw his keen blade"
346,BOOK I.,"from his thigh and set the company aside and so slay Atreides, or to"
347,BOOK I.,assuage his anger and curb his soul. While yet he doubted thereof in
348,BOOK I.,"heart and soul, and was drawing his great sword from his sheath, Athene"
349,BOOK I.,"came to him from heaven, sent forth of the white-armed goddess Hera,"
350,BOOK I.,whose heart loved both alike and had care for them. She stood behind
351,BOOK I.,"Peleus’ son and caught him by his golden hair, to him only visible, and"
352,BOOK I.,"of the rest no man beheld her. Then Achilles marvelled, and turned him"
353,BOOK I.,"about, and straightway knew Pallas Athene; and terribly shone her eyes."
354,BOOK I.,"He spake to her winged words, and said: “Why now art thou come hither,"
355,BOOK I.,thou daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus? Is it to behold the insolence of
356,BOOK I.,"Agamemnon, son of Atreus. Yea, I will tell thee that I deem shall even"
357,BOOK I.,be brought to pass: by his own haughtinesses shall he soon lose his
358,BOOK I.,life.”
359,BOOK I.,
360,BOOK I.,Then the bright-eyed goddess Athene spake to him again: “I came from
361,BOOK I.,"heaven to stay thine anger, if perchance thou wilt hearken to me, being"
362,BOOK I.,"sent forth if the white-armed goddess Hera, that loveth you twain alike"
363,BOOK I.,"and careth for you. Go to now, cease from strife, and let not thine"
364,BOOK I.,"hand draw the sword; yet with words indeed revile him, even as it shall"
365,BOOK I.,"come to pass. For thus will I say to thee, and so it shall be"
366,BOOK I.,"fulfilled; hereafter shall goodly gifts come to thee, yea in threefold"
367,BOOK I.,"measure, by reason of this despite; hold thou thine hand, and hearken"
368,BOOK I.,to us.”
369,BOOK I.,
370,BOOK I.,"And Achilles fleet of foot made answer and said to her: “Goddess, needs"
371,BOOK I.,"must a man observe the saying of you twain, even though he be very"
372,BOOK I.,"wroth at heart; for so is the better way. Whosoever obeyeth the gods,"
373,BOOK I.,to him they gladly hearken.”
374,BOOK I.,
375,BOOK I.,"He said, and stayed his heavy hand on the silver hilt, and thrust the"
376,BOOK I.,"great sword back into the sheath, and was not disobedient to the saying"
377,BOOK I.,"of Athene; and she forthwith was departed to Olympus, to the other gods"
378,BOOK I.,in the palace of aegis-bearing Zeus.
379,BOOK I.,
380,BOOK I.,"Then Peleus’ son spake again with bitter words to Atreus’ son, and in"
381,BOOK I.,"no wise ceased from anger: “Thou heavy with wine, thou with face of dog"
382,BOOK I.,"and heart of deer, never didst thou take courage to arm for battle"
383,BOOK I.,among thy folk or to lay ambush with the princes of the Achaians; that
384,BOOK I.,"to thee were even as death. Far better booteth it, forsooth, to seize"
385,BOOK I.,for thyself the meed of honour of every man through the wide host of
386,BOOK I.,the Achaians that speaketh contrary to thee. Folk-devouring king!
387,BOOK I.,"seeing thou rulest men of naught; else were this despite, thou son of"
388,BOOK I.,"Atreus, thy last. But I will speak my word to thee, and swear a mighty"
389,BOOK I.,oath therewith: verily by this staff that shall no more put forth leaf
390,BOOK I.,"or twig, seeing it hath for ever left its trunk among the hills,"
391,BOOK I.,"neither shall it grow green again, because the axe hath stripped it of"
392,BOOK I.,leaves and bark; and now the sons of the Achaians that exercise
393,BOOK I.,"judgment bear it in their hands, even they that by Zeus’ command watch"
394,BOOK I.,over the traditions—so shall this be a mighty oath in thine eyes—verily
395,BOOK I.,shall longing for Achilles come hereafter upon the sons of the Achaians
396,BOOK I.,"one and all; and then wilt thou in no wise avail to save them, for all"
397,BOOK I.,"thy grief, when multitudes fall dying before manslaying Hector. Then"
398,BOOK I.,shalt thou tear thy heart within thee for anger that thou didst in no
399,BOOK I.,wise honour the best of the Achaians.”
400,BOOK I.,
401,BOOK I.,So said Peleides and dashed to earth the staff studded with golden
402,BOOK I.,"nails, and himself sat down; and over against him Atreides waxed"
403,BOOK I.,"furious. Then in their midst rose up Nestor, pleasant of speech, the"
404,BOOK I.,"clear-voiced orator of the Pylians, he from whose tongue flowed"
405,BOOK I.,discourse sweeter than honey. Two generations of mortal men already had
406,BOOK I.,"he seen perish, that had been of old time born and nurtured with him in"
407,BOOK I.,"goodly Pylos, and he was king among the third. He of good intent made"
408,BOOK I.,"harangue to them and said: “Alas, of a truth sore lamentation cometh"
409,BOOK I.,"upon the land of Achaia. Verily Priam would be glad and Priam’s sons,"
410,BOOK I.,"and all the Trojans would have great joy of heart, were they to hear"
411,BOOK I.,all this tale of strife between you twain that are chiefest of the
412,BOOK I.,"Danaans in counsel and chiefest in battle. Nay, hearken to me; ye are"
413,BOOK I.,younger both than I. Of old days held I converse with better men even
414,BOOK I.,"than you, and never did they make light of me. Yea, I never beheld such"
415,BOOK I.,"warriors, nor shall behold, as were Peirithoos and Dryas shepherd of"
416,BOOK I.,the host and Kaineus and Exadios and godlike Polyphemos [and Theseus
417,BOOK I.,"son of Aigeus, like to the immortals]. Mightiest of growth were they of"
418,BOOK I.,all men upon the earth; mightiest they were and with the mightiest
419,BOOK I.,"fought they, even the wild tribes of the mountain caves, and destroyed"
420,BOOK I.,"them utterly. And with these held I converse, being come from Pylos,"
421,BOOK I.,from a distant land afar; for of themselves they summoned me. So I
422,BOOK I.,played my part in fight; and with them could none of men that are now
423,BOOK I.,on earth do battle. And they laid to heart my counsels and hearkened to
424,BOOK I.,"my voice. Even so hearken ye also, for better is it to hearken. Neither"
425,BOOK I.,"do thou, though thou art very great, seize from him his damsel, but"
426,BOOK I.,leave her as she was given at the first by the sons of the Achaians to
427,BOOK I.,"be a meed of honour; nor do thou, son of Peleus, think to strive with a"
428,BOOK I.,"king, might against might; seeing that no common honour pertaineth to a"
429,BOOK I.,"sceptred king to whom Zeus apportioneth glory. Though thou be strong,"
430,BOOK I.,"and a goddess mother bare thee, yet his is the greater place, for he is"
431,BOOK I.,"king over more. And thou, Atreides, abate thy fury; nay, it is even I"
432,BOOK I.,"that beseech thee to let go thine anger with Achilles, who is made unto"
433,BOOK I.,all the Achaians a mighty bulwark of evil war.”
434,BOOK I.,
435,BOOK I.,"Then lord Agamemnon answered and said: “Yea verily, old man, all this"
436,BOOK I.,thou sayest is according unto right. But this fellow would be above all
437,BOOK I.,"others, he would be lord of all and king among all and captain to all;"
438,BOOK I.,wherein I deem none will hearken to him. Though the immortal gods made
439,BOOK I.,"him a spearman, do they therefore put revilings in his mouth for him to"
440,BOOK I.,utter?”
441,BOOK I.,
442,BOOK I.,"Then goodly Achilles brake in on him and answered: “Yea, for I should"
443,BOOK I.,"be called coward and man of naught, if I yield to thee in every matter,"
444,BOOK I.,"howsoe’er thou bid. To others give now thine orders, not to me [play"
445,BOOK I.,"master; for thee I deem that I shall no more obey]. This, moreover,"
446,BOOK I.,"will I say to thee, and do thou lay it to thy heart. Know that not by"
447,BOOK I.,"violence will I strive for the damsel’s sake, neither with thee nor any"
448,BOOK I.,other; ye gave and ye have taken away. But of all else that is mine
449,BOOK I.,"beside my fleet black ship, thereof shalt thou not take anything or"
450,BOOK I.,"bear it away against my will. Yea, go to now, make trial, that all"
451,BOOK I.,these may see; forthwith thy dark blood shall gush about my spear.”
452,BOOK I.,
453,BOOK I.,"Now when the twain had thus finished the battle of violent words, they"
454,BOOK I.,stood up and dissolved the assembly beside the Achaian ships. Peleides
455,BOOK I.,went his way to his huts and trim ships with Menoitios’ son* and his
456,BOOK I.,"company; and Atreides launched a fleet ship on the sea, and picked"
457,BOOK I.,"twenty oarsmen therefor, and embarked the hecatomb for the god, and"
458,BOOK I.,brought Chryseis of the fair cheeks and set her therein; and Odysseus
459,BOOK I.,of many devices went to be their captain.
460,BOOK I.,
461,BOOK I.,* Patroklos
462,BOOK I.,
463,BOOK I.,
464,BOOK I.,So these embarked and sailed over the wet ways; and Atreides bade the
465,BOOK I.,"folk purify themselves. So they purified themselves, and cast the"
466,BOOK I.,"defilements into the sea and did sacrifice to Apollo, even unblemished"
467,BOOK I.,"hecatombs of bulls and goats, along the shore of the unvintaged sea;"
468,BOOK I.,and the sweet savour arose to heaven eddying amid the smoke.
469,BOOK I.,
470,BOOK I.,Thus were they busied throughout the host; but Agamemnon ceased not
471,BOOK I.,from the strife wherewith he threatened Achilles at the first; he spake
472,BOOK I.,to Talthybios and Eurybates that were his heralds and nimble squires:
473,BOOK I.,"“Go ye to the tent of Achilles Peleus’ son, and take Briseis of the"
474,BOOK I.,"fair cheeks by the hand and lead her hither; and if he give her not,"
475,BOOK I.,"then will I myself go, and more with me, and seize her; and that will"
476,BOOK I.,be yet more grievous for him.”
477,BOOK I.,
478,BOOK I.,"So saying he sent them forth, and laid stern charge upon them."
479,BOOK I.,"Unwillingly went they along the beach of the unvintaged sea, and came"
480,BOOK I.,to the huts and ships of the Myrmidons. Him found they sitting beside
481,BOOK I.,his hut and black ship; nor when he saw them was Achilles glad. So they
482,BOOK I.,"in dread and reverence of the king stood, and spake to him no word, nor"
483,BOOK I.,"questioned him. But he knew in his heart, and spake to them: “All hail,"
484,BOOK I.,"ye heralds, messengers of Zeus and men, come near; ye are not guilty in"
485,BOOK I.,"my sight, but Agamemnon that sent you for the sake of the damsel"
486,BOOK I.,"Briseis. Go now, heaven-sprung Patroklos, bring forth the damsel, and"
487,BOOK I.,"give them her to lead away. Moreover, let the twain themselves be my"
488,BOOK I.,"witnesses before the face of the blessed gods and mortal men, yea and"
489,BOOK I.,"of him, that king untoward, against the day when there cometh need of"
490,BOOK I.,me hereafter to save them all from shameful wreck. Of a truth he raveth
491,BOOK I.,"with baleful mind, and hath not knowledge to look before and after,"
492,BOOK I.,that so his Achaians might battle in safety beside their ships.”
493,BOOK I.,
494,BOOK I.,"So said he, and Patroklos hearkened to his dear comrade, and led forth"
495,BOOK I.,"from the hut Briseis of the fair cheeks, and gave them her to lead"
496,BOOK I.,"away. So these twain took their way back along the Achaians’ ships, and"
497,BOOK I.,"with them went the woman all unwilling. Then Achilles wept anon, and"
498,BOOK I.,"sat him down apart, aloof from his comrades on the beach of the grey"
499,BOOK I.,"sea, gazing across the boundless main; he stretched forth his hands and"
500,BOOK I.,"prayed instantly to his dear mother: “Mother, seeing thou didst of a"
501,BOOK I.,"truth bear me to so brief span of life, honour at the least ought the"
502,BOOK I.,"Olympian to have granted me, even Zeus that thundereth on high; but now"
503,BOOK I.,"doth he not honour me, no, not one whit. Verily Atreus’ son,"
504,BOOK I.,"wide-ruling Agamemnon, hath done me dishonour; for he hath taken away"
505,BOOK I.,my meed of honour and keepeth her of his own violent deed.”
506,BOOK I.,
507,BOOK I.,"So spake he weeping, and his lady mother heard him as she sate in the"
508,BOOK I.,sea-depths beside her aged sire. With speed arose she from the grey
509,BOOK I.,"sea, like a mist, and sate her before the face of her weeping son, and"
510,BOOK I.,"stroked him with her hand, and spake and called on his name: “My child,"
511,BOOK I.,why weepest thou? What sorrow hath entered into they heart? Speak it
512,BOOK I.,"forth, hide it not in thy mind, that both may know it.”"
513,BOOK I.,
514,BOOK I.,Then with heavy moan Achilles fleet of foot spake to her: “Thou knowest
515,BOOK I.,it; why should I tell this to thee that knowest all! We had fared to
516,BOOK I.,"Thebe, the holy city of Eëtion, and laid it waste and carried hither"
517,BOOK I.,all the spoils. So the sons of the Achaians divided among them all
518,BOOK I.,aright; and for Atreides they set apart Chryseis of the fair cheeks.
519,BOOK I.,"But Chryses, priest of Apollo the Far-darter, came unto the fleet ships"
520,BOOK I.,"of the mail-clad Achaians to win his daughter’s freedom, and brought a"
521,BOOK I.,"ransom beyond telling, and bare in his hands the fillet of Apollo the"
522,BOOK I.,"Far-darter upon a golden staff, and made his prayer unto all the"
523,BOOK I.,"Achaians, and most of all to the two sons of Atreus, orderers of the"
524,BOOK I.,"host. Then all the other Achaians cried assent, to reverence the priest"
525,BOOK I.,and accept his goodly ransom; yet the thing pleased not the heart of
526,BOOK I.,"Agamemnon son of Atreus, but he roughly sent him away and laid stern"
527,BOOK I.,charge upon him. So the old man went back in anger; and Apollo heard
528,BOOK I.,"his prayers, seeing he loved him greatly, and he aimed against the"
529,BOOK I.,"Argives his deadly darts. So the people began to perish in multitudes,"
530,BOOK I.,and the god’s shafts ranged everywhither throughout the wide host of
531,BOOK I.,the Achaians. Then of full knowledge the seer declared to us the oracle
532,BOOK I.,of the Far-darter. Forthwith I first bade propitiate the god; but wrath
533,BOOK I.,"gat hold upon Atreus’ son thereat, and anon he stood up and spake a"
534,BOOK I.,"threatening word, that hath now been accomplished. Her the"
535,BOOK I.,"glancing-eyed Achaians are bringing on their fleet ship to Chryse, and"
536,BOOK I.,bear with them offerings to the king; and the other but now the heralds
537,BOOK I.,"went and took from my hut, even the daughter of Briseus, whom the sons"
538,BOOK I.,"of the Achaians gave me. Thou therefore, if indeed thou canst, guard"
539,BOOK I.,thine own* son; betake thee to Olympus and beseech Zeus by any deed or
540,BOOK I.,word whereby thou ever didst make glad his heart. For oft have I heard
541,BOOK I.,thee proclaiming in my father’s halls and telling that thou alone amid
542,BOOK I.,"the immortals didst save the son of Kronos, lord of the storm-cloud,"
543,BOOK I.,"from shameful wreck, when all the other Olympians would have bound him,"
544,BOOK I.,"even Hera and Poseidon and Pallas Athene. Then didst thou, O goddess,"
545,BOOK I.,"enter in and loose him from his bonds, having with speed summoned to"
546,BOOK I.,"high Olympus him of the hundred arms whom gods call Briareus, but all"
547,BOOK I.,men call Aigaion; for he is mightier even than his father—so he sate
548,BOOK I.,"him by Kronion’s side rejoicing in his triumph, and the blessed gods"
549,BOOK I.,feared him withal and bound not Zeus. This bring thou to his
550,BOOK I.,"remembrance and sit by him and clasp his knees, if perchance he will"
551,BOOK I.,"give succour to the Trojans; and for the Achaians, hem them among their"
552,BOOK I.,"ships’ sterns about the bay, given over to slaughter; that they may"
553,BOOK I.,"make trial of their king, and that even Atreides, wide-ruling"
554,BOOK I.,"Agamemnon, may perceive his blindness, in that he honoured not at all"
555,BOOK I.,the best of the Achaians.”
556,BOOK I.,
557,BOOK I.,* Reading ἑοῖο.
558,BOOK I.,
559,BOOK I.,
560,BOOK I.,"Then Thetis weeping made answer to him: “Ah me, my child, why reared I"
561,BOOK I.,"thee, cursed in my motherhood? Would thou hadst been left tearless and"
562,BOOK I.,"griefless amid the ships, seeing thy lot is very brief and endureth no"
563,BOOK I.,long while; but now art thou made short-lived alike and lamentable
564,BOOK I.,beyond all men; in an evil hour I bare thee in our halls. But I will go
565,BOOK I.,"myself to snow-clad Olympus to tell this thy saying to Zeus, whose joy"
566,BOOK I.,"is in the thunder*, if perchance he may hearken to me. But tarry thou"
567,BOOK I.,"now amid thy fleet-faring ships, and continue wroth with the Achaians,"
568,BOOK I.,"and refrain utterly from battle: for Zeus went yesterday to Okeanos,"
569,BOOK I.,"unto the noble Ethiopians for a feast, and all the gods followed with"
570,BOOK I.,"him; but on the twelfth day will he return to Olympus, and then will I"
571,BOOK I.,"fare to Zeus’ palace of the bronze threshold, and will kneel to him and"
572,BOOK I.,think to win him.”
573,BOOK I.,
574,BOOK I.,"* perhaps rather, “hurler of the thunderbolt.”"
575,BOOK I.,
576,BOOK I.,
577,BOOK I.,"So saying she went her way and left him there, vexed in spirit for the"
578,BOOK I.,"fair-girdled woman’s sake, whom they had taken perforce despite his"
579,BOOK I.,will: and meanwhile Odysseus came to Chryse with the holy hecatomb.
580,BOOK I.,"When they were now entered within the deep haven, they furled their"
581,BOOK I.,"sails and laid them in the black ship, and lowered the mast by the"
582,BOOK I.,"forestays and brought it to the crutch with speed, and rowed her with"
583,BOOK I.,oars to the anchorage. Then they cast out the mooring stones and made
584,BOOK I.,"fast the hawsers, and so themselves went forth on to the sea-beach, and"
585,BOOK I.,"forth they brought the hecatomb for the Far-darter Apollo, and forth"
586,BOOK I.,came Chryseis withal from the seafaring ship. Then Odysseus of many
587,BOOK I.,"counsels brought her to the altar and gave her into her father’s arms,"
588,BOOK I.,"and spake unto him: “Chryses, Agamemnon king of men sent me hither to"
589,BOOK I.,"bring thee thy daughter, and to offer to Phoebus a holy hecatomb on the"
590,BOOK I.,"Danaans’ behalf, wherewith to propitiate the king that hath now brought"
591,BOOK I.,sorrow and lamentation on the Argives.”
592,BOOK I.,
593,BOOK I.,"So saying he gave her to his arms, and he gladly took his dear child;"
594,BOOK I.,and anon they set in order for the god the holy hecatomb about his
595,BOOK I.,well-builded altar; next washed they their hands and took up the barley
596,BOOK I.,meal. Then Chryses lifted up his hands and prayed aloud for them:
597,BOOK I.,"“Hearken to me, god of the silver bow that standest over Chryse and"
598,BOOK I.,"holy Killa, and rulest Tenedos with might; even as erst thou heardest"
599,BOOK I.,"my prayer, and didst me honour, and mightily afflictest the people of"
600,BOOK I.,"the Achaians, even so now fulfil me this my desire: remove thou from"
601,BOOK I.,the Danaans forthwith the loathly pestilence.”
602,BOOK I.,
603,BOOK I.,"So spake he in prayer, and Phoebus Apollo heard him. Now when they had"
604,BOOK I.,"prayed and sprinkled the barley meal, first they drew back the victims’"
605,BOOK I.,"heads and slaughtered them and flayed them, and cut slices from the"
606,BOOK I.,"thighs and wrapped them in fat, making a double fold, and laid raw"
607,BOOK I.,"collops thereon, and the old man burnt them on cleft wood and made"
608,BOOK I.,libation over them of gleaming wine; and at his side the young men in
609,BOOK I.,their hands held five-pronged forks. Now when the thighs were burnt and
610,BOOK I.,"they had tasted the vitals, then sliced they all the rest and pierced"
611,BOOK I.,"it through with spits, and roasted it carefully, and drew all off"
612,BOOK I.,again. So when they had rest from the task and had made ready the
613,BOOK I.,"banquet, they feasted, nor was their heart aught stinted of the fair"
614,BOOK I.,banquet. But when they had put away from them the desire of meat and
615,BOOK I.,"drink, the young men crowned the bowls with wine, and gave each man his"
616,BOOK I.,portion after the drink-offering had been poured into the cups. So all
617,BOOK I.,"day long worshipped they the god with music, singing the beautiful"
618,BOOK I.,"paean, the sons of the Achaians making music to the Far-darter;* and"
619,BOOK I.,his heart was glad to hear. And when the sun went down and darkness
620,BOOK I.,"came on them, they laid them to sleep beside the ship’s hawsers; and"
621,BOOK I.,"when rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, the child of morning, then set they"
622,BOOK I.,sail for the wide camp of the Achaians; and Apollo the Far-darter sent
623,BOOK I.,them a favouring gale. They set up their mast and spread the white
624,BOOK I.,"sails forth, and the wind filled the sail’s belly and the dark wave"
625,BOOK I.,"sang loud about the stem as the ship made way, and she sped across the"
626,BOOK I.,"wave, accomplishing her journey. So when they were now come to the wide"
627,BOOK I.,"camp of the Achaians, they drew up their black ship to land high upon"
628,BOOK I.,"the sands, and set in line the long props beneath her; and themselves"
629,BOOK I.,were scattered amid their huts and ships.

632,BOOK I.,
633,BOOK I.,
634,BOOK I.,"But he sat by his swift-faring ships, still wroth, even the"
635,BOOK I.,"heaven-sprung son of Peleus, Achilles fleet of foot; he betook him"
636,BOOK I.,"neither to the assembly that is the hero’s glory, neither to war, but"
637,BOOK I.,"consumed his heart in tarrying in his place, and yearned for the"
638,BOOK I.,war-cry and for battle.
639,BOOK I.,
640,BOOK I.,"Now when the twelfth morn thereafter was come, then the gods that are"
641,BOOK I.,"for ever fared to Olympus all in company, led of Zeus. And Thetis"
642,BOOK I.,"forgat not her son’s charge, but rose up from the sea-wave, and at"
643,BOOK I.,early morn mounted up to great heaven and Olympus. There found she
644,BOOK I.,Kronos’ son of the far-sounding voice sitting apart from all on the
645,BOOK I.,topmost peak of many-ridged Olympus. So she sat before his face and
646,BOOK I.,"with her left hand clasped his knees, and with her right touched him"
647,BOOK I.,"beneath his chin, and spake in prayer to king Zeus son of Kronos:"
648,BOOK I.,"“Father Zeus, if ever I gave thee aid amid the immortal gods, whether"
649,BOOK I.,"by word or deed, fulfil thou this my desire: do honour to my son, that"
650,BOOK I.,is doomed to earliest death of all men: now hath Agamemnon king of men
651,BOOK I.,"done him dishonour, for he hath taken away his meed of honour and"
652,BOOK I.,"keepeth her of his own violent deed. But honour thou him, Zeus of"
653,BOOK I.,"Olympus, lord of counsel; grant thou victory to the Trojans the while"
654,BOOK I.,until the Achaians do my son honour and exalt him with recompense.”
655,BOOK I.,
656,BOOK I.,"So spake she; but Zeus the cloud-gatherer said no word to her, and sat"
657,BOOK I.,"long time in silence. But even as Thetis had clasped his knees, so held"
658,BOOK I.,"she by him clinging, and questioned him yet a second time: “Promise me"
659,BOOK I.,"now this thing verily, and bow thy head thereto; or else deny me,"
660,BOOK I.,seeing there is naught for thee to fear; that I may know full well how
661,BOOK I.,I among all gods am least in honour.”
662,BOOK I.,
663,BOOK I.,"Then Zeus the cloud-gatherer, sore troubled, spake to her: “Verily it"
664,BOOK I.,"is a sorry matter, if thou wilt set me at variance with Hera, whene’er"
665,BOOK I.,she provoketh me with taunting words. Even now she upbraideth me ever
666,BOOK I.,"amid the immortal gods, and saith that I aid the Trojans in battle. But"
667,BOOK I.,"do thou now depart again, lest Hera mark aught; and I will take thought"
668,BOOK I.,"for these things to fulfil them. Come now, I will bow my head to thee,"
669,BOOK I.,"that thou mayest be of good courage; for that, of my part, is the"
670,BOOK I.,surest token amid the immortals; no word of mine is revocable nor false
671,BOOK I.,nor unfulfilled when the bowing of my head hath pledged it.”
672,BOOK I.,
673,BOOK I.,"Kronion spake, and bowed his dark brow, and the ambrosial locks waved"
674,BOOK I.,from the king’s immortal head; and he made great Olympus quake.
675,BOOK I.,
676,BOOK I.,Thus the twain took counsel and parted; she leapt therewith into the
677,BOOK I.,"deep sea from glittering Olympus, and Zeus fared to his own palace. All"
678,BOOK I.,the gods in company arose from their seats before their father’s face;
679,BOOK I.,"neither ventured any to await his coming, but stood up all before him."
680,BOOK I.,"So he sate him there upon his throne; but Hera saw, and was not"
681,BOOK I.,"ignorant how that the daughter of the Ancient of the sea, Thetis the"
682,BOOK I.,"silver-footed, had devised counsel with him. Anon with taunting words"
683,BOOK I.,"spake she to Zeus the son of Kronos: “Now who among the gods, thou"
684,BOOK I.,"crafty of mind, hath devised counsel with thee? It is ever thy good"
685,BOOK I.,pleasure to hold aloof from me and in secret meditation to give thy
686,BOOK I.,"judgments, nor of thine own good will hast thou ever brought thyself to"
687,BOOK I.,declare unto me the thing thou purposest.”
688,BOOK I.,
689,BOOK I.,"Then the father of gods and men made answer her: “Hera, think not thou"
690,BOOK I.,"to know all my sayings; hard they are for thee, even though thou art my"
691,BOOK I.,"wife. But whichsoever it is seemly for thee to hear, none sooner than"
692,BOOK I.,"thou shall know, be he god or man. Only when I will to take thought"
693,BOOK I.,"aloof from the gods, then do not thou ask of every matter nor make"
694,BOOK I.,question.”
695,BOOK I.,
696,BOOK I.,Then Hera the ox-eyed queen made answer to him. “Most dread son of
697,BOOK I.,"Kronos, what word is this thou hast spoken? Yea, surely of old I have"
698,BOOK I.,"not asked thee nor made question, but in my heart sore afraid lest thou"
699,BOOK I.,"have been won over by silver-footed Thetis, daughter of the Ancient of"
700,BOOK I.,"the sea, for she at early morn sat by thee and clasped thy knees. To"
701,BOOK I.,her I deem thou gavest a sure pledge that thou wilt do honour to
702,BOOK I.,"Achilles, and lay many low beside the Achaians’ ships.”"
703,BOOK I.,
704,BOOK I.,"To her made answer Zeus the cloud-gatherer: “Lady, Good lack! ever art"
705,BOOK I.,"thou imagining, nor can I escape thee; yet shalt thou in no wise have"
706,BOOK I.,"power to fulfil, but wilt be the further from my heart; that shall be"
707,BOOK I.,"even the worse for thee. And if it be so, then such must my good"
708,BOOK I.,"pleasure be. Abide thou in silence and hearken to my bidding, lest all"
709,BOOK I.,"the gods that are in Olympus keep not off from thee my visitation, when"
710,BOOK I.,I put forth my hands unapproachable against thee.”
711,BOOK I.,
712,BOOK I.,"He said, and Hera the ox-eyed queen was afraid, and sat in silence,"
713,BOOK I.,curbing her heart; but throughout Zeus’ palace the gods of heaven were
714,BOOK I.,troubled. Then Hephaistos the famed craftsman began to make harangue
715,BOOK I.,"among them, to do kindness to his mother, white-armed Hera: “Verily"
716,BOOK I.,"this will be a sorry matter, neither any more endurable, if ye twain"
717,BOOK I.,"thus fight for mortals’ sakes, and bring wrangling among the gods;"
718,BOOK I.,"neither will there any more be joy of the goodly feast, seeing that"
719,BOOK I.,"evil triumpheth. So I give counsel to my mother, though herself is"
720,BOOK I.,"wise, to do kindness to our dear father Zeus, that our father upbraid"
721,BOOK I.,"us not again and cast the banquet in confusion. What if the Olympian,"
722,BOOK I.,"the lord of the lightning, will to dash us from our seats! for he is"
723,BOOK I.,"strongest far. Nay, approach thou him with gentle words, then will the"
724,BOOK I.,Olympian forthwith be gracious unto us.”
725,BOOK I.,
726,BOOK I.,So speaking he rose up and sat in his dear mother’s hand the
727,BOOK I.,"twy-handled cup, and spake to her: “Be of good courage, mother mine,"
728,BOOK I.,"and endure, though thou art vexed, lest I behold thee, thou art so"
729,BOOK I.,"dear, chastised before mine eyes, and then shall I not be able for all"
730,BOOK I.,"my sorrow to save thee; for the Olympian is a hard foe to face. Yea,"
731,BOOK I.,"once ere this, when I was fain to save thee, he caught me by my foot"
732,BOOK I.,"and hurled me from the heavenly threshold; all day I flew, and at the"
733,BOOK I.,"set of sun I fell in Lemnos, and little life was in me. There did the"
734,BOOK I.,Sintian folk forthwith tend me for my fall.”
735,BOOK I.,
736,BOOK I.,"He spake, and the white-armed goddess Hera smiled, and smiling took the"
737,BOOK I.,cup at her son’s hand. Then he poured wine to all the other gods from
738,BOOK I.,"right to left, ladling the sweet nectar from the bowl. And laughter"
739,BOOK I.,unquenchable arose amid the blessed gods to see Hephaistos bustling
740,BOOK I.,through the palace.
741,BOOK I.,
742,BOOK I.,So feasted they all day till the setting of the sun; nor was their soul
743,BOOK I.,"aught stinted of the fair banquet, nor of the beauteous lyre that"
744,BOOK I.,"Apollo held, and the Muses singing alternately with sweet voice."
745,BOOK I.,
746,BOOK I.,"Now when the bright light of the sun was set, these went each to his"
747,BOOK I.,"own house to sleep, where each one had his palace made with cunning"
748,BOOK I.,"device by famed Hephaistos the lame god; and Zeus the Olympian, the"
749,BOOK I.,"lord of lightning, departed to his couch where he was wont of old to"
750,BOOK I.,"take his rest, whenever sweet sleep visited him. There went he up and"
751,BOOK I.,"slept, and beside him was Hera of the golden throne."
752,BOOK I.,
753,BOOK I.,
754,BOOK I.,
755,BOOK I.,
756,BOOK II.,BOOK II.
757,BOOK II.,
758,BOOK II.,
759,BOOK II.,How Zeus beguiled Agamemnon by a dream; and of the assembly of the
760,BOOK II.,Achaians and their marching forth to battle. And of the names and
761,BOOK II.,numbers of the hosts of the Achaians and the Trojans.
762,BOOK II.,
763,BOOK II.,
764,BOOK II.,"Now all other gods and chariot-driving men slept all night long, only"
765,BOOK II.,Zeus was not holden of sweet sleep; rather was he pondering in his
766,BOOK II.,heart how he should do honour to Achilles and destroy many beside the
767,BOOK II.,"Achaians’ ships. And this design seemed to his mind the best, to wit,"
768,BOOK II.,"to send a baneful dream upon Agamemnon son of Atreus. So he spake, and"
769,BOOK II.,"uttered to him winged words: “Come now, thou baneful Dream, go to the"
770,BOOK II.,"Achaians’ fleet ships, enter into the hut of Agamemnon son of Atreus,"
771,BOOK II.,and tell him every word plainly as I charge thee. Bid him call to arms
772,BOOK II.,"the flowing-haired Achaians with all speed, for that now he may take"
773,BOOK II.,the wide-wayed city of the Trojans. For the immortals that dwell in the
774,BOOK II.,"halls of Olympus are no longer divided in counsel, since Hera hath"
775,BOOK II.,"turned the minds of all by her beseeching, and over the Trojans sorrows"
776,BOOK II.,hang.”
777,BOOK II.,
778,BOOK II.,"So spake he, and the Dream went his way when he had heard the charge."
779,BOOK II.,"With speed he came to the Achaians’ fleet ships, and went to Agamemnon"
780,BOOK II.,"son of Atreus, and found him sleeping in his hut, and ambrosial slumber"
781,BOOK II.,poured over him. So he stood over his head in seeming like unto the son
782,BOOK II.,"of Neleus, even Nestor, whom most of all the elders Agamemnon honoured;"
783,BOOK II.,in his likeness spake to him the heavenly Dream:
784,BOOK II.,
785,BOOK II.,"“Sleepest thou, son of wise Atreus tamer of horses? To sleep all night"
786,BOOK II.,"through beseemeth not one that is a counsellor, to whom peoples are"
787,BOOK II.,"entrusted and so many cares belong. But now hearken straightway to me,"
788,BOOK II.,"for I am a messenger to thee from Zeus, who though he be afar yet hath"
789,BOOK II.,great care for thee and pity. He biddeth thee call to arms the
790,BOOK II.,"flowing-haired Achaians with all speed, for that now thou mayest take"
791,BOOK II.,the wide-wayed city of the Trojans. For the immortals that dwell in the
792,BOOK II.,"halls of Olympus are no longer divided in counsel, since Hera hath"
793,BOOK II.,"turned the minds of all by her beseeching, and over the Trojans sorrows"
794,BOOK II.,"hang by the will of Zeus. But do thou keep this in thy heart, not let"
795,BOOK II.,forgetfulness come upon thee when honeyed sleep shall leave thee.”
796,BOOK II.,
797,BOOK II.,"So spake the Dream, and departed and left him there, deeming in his"
798,BOOK II.,mind things that were not to be fulfilled. For indeed he thought to
799,BOOK II.,"take Priam’s city that very day; fond man, in that he knew not the"
800,BOOK II.,"plans that Zeus had in mind, who was willed to bring yet more grief and"
801,BOOK II.,wailing on Trojans alike and Danaans throughout the course of stubborn
802,BOOK II.,"fights. Then woke he from sleep, and the heavenly voice was in his"
803,BOOK II.,"ears. So he rose up sitting, and donned his soft tunic, fair and"
804,BOOK II.,"bright, and cast around him his great cloak, and beneath his glistering"
805,BOOK II.,"feet he bound his fair sandals, and over his shoulders cast his"
806,BOOK II.,"silver-studded sword, and grasped his sires’ sceptre, imperishable for"
807,BOOK II.,"ever, wherewith he took his way amid the mail-clad Achaians’ ships."
808,BOOK II.,
809,BOOK II.,"Now went the goddess Dawn to high Olympus, foretelling daylight to Zeus"
810,BOOK II.,and all the immortals; and the king bade the clear-voiced heralds
811,BOOK II.,summon to the assembly the flowing-haired Achaians. So did those
812,BOOK II.,"summon, and these gathered with speed."
813,BOOK II.,
814,BOOK II.,But first the council of the great-hearted elders met beside the ship
815,BOOK II.,of king Nestor the Pylos-born. And he that had assembled them framed
816,BOOK II.,"his cunning counsel: “Hearken, my friends. A dream from heaven came to"
817,BOOK II.,"me in my sleep through the ambrosial night, and chiefly to goodly"
818,BOOK II.,Nestor was very like in shape and bulk and stature. And it stood over
819,BOOK II.,"my head and charged me saying: ‘Sleepest thou, son of wise Atreus tamer"
820,BOOK II.,of horses? To sleep all night through beseemeth not one that is a
821,BOOK II.,"counsellor, to whom peoples are entrusted and so many cares belong. But"
822,BOOK II.,"now hearken straightway to me, for I am a messenger to thee from Zeus,"
823,BOOK II.,who though he be afar yet hath great care for thee and pity. He biddeth
824,BOOK II.,"thee call to arms the flowing-haired Achaians with all speed, for that"
825,BOOK II.,now thou mayest take the wide-wayed city of the Trojans. For the
826,BOOK II.,immortals that dwell in the palaces of Olympus are no longer divided in
827,BOOK II.,"counsel, since Hera hath turned the minds of all by her beseeching, and"
828,BOOK II.,over the Trojans sorrows hang by the will of Zeus. But do thou keep
829,BOOK II.,"this in thy heart.’ So spake the dream and was flown away, and sweet"
830,BOOK II.,"sleep left me. So come, let us now call to arms as we may the sons of"
831,BOOK II.,the Achaians. But first I will speak to make trial of them as is
832,BOOK II.,"fitting, and bid them flee with their benched ships; only do ye from"
833,BOOK II.,this side and from that speak to hold them back.”
834,BOOK II.,
835,BOOK II.,"So spake he and sate him down; and there stood up among them Nestor,"
836,BOOK II.,who was king of sandy Pylos. He of good intent made harangue to them
837,BOOK II.,"and said: “My friends, captains and rulers of the Argives, had any"
838,BOOK II.,other of the Achaians told us this dream we might deem it a false
839,BOOK II.,"thing, and rather turn away therefrom; but now he hath seen it who of"
840,BOOK II.,"all Achaians avoweth himself far greatest. So come, let us call to arms"
841,BOOK II.,as we may the sons of the Achaians.”
842,BOOK II.,
843,BOOK II.,"So spake he, and led the way forth from the council, and all the other"
844,BOOK II.,sceptred chiefs rose with him and obeyed the shepherd of the host; and
845,BOOK II.,the people hastened to them. Even as when the tribes of thronging bees
846,BOOK II.,"issue from the hollow rock, ever in fresh procession, and fly"
847,BOOK II.,"clustering among the flowers of spring, and some on this hand and some"
848,BOOK II.,on that fly thick; even so from ships and huts before the low beach
849,BOOK II.,marched forth their many tribes by companies to the place of assembly.
850,BOOK II.,"And in their midst blazed forth Rumour, messenger of Zeus, urging them"
851,BOOK II.,to go; and so they gathered. And the place of assemblage was in an
852,BOOK II.,"uproar, and the earth echoed again as the hosts sate them down, and"
853,BOOK II.,"there was turmoil. Nine heralds restrained them with shouting, if"
854,BOOK II.,"perchance they might refrain from clamour, and hearken to their kings,"
855,BOOK II.,"the fosterlings of Zeus. And hardly at the last would the people sit,"
856,BOOK II.,and keep them to their benches and cease from noise. Then stood up lord
857,BOOK II.,"Agamemnon bearing his sceptre, that Hephaistos had wrought curiously."
858,BOOK II.,"Hephaistos gave it to king Zeus son of Kronos, and then Zeus gave it to"
859,BOOK II.,the messenger-god the slayer of Argus;* and king Hermes gave it to
860,BOOK II.,"Pelops the charioteer, and Pelops again gave it to Atreus shepherd of"
861,BOOK II.,"the host. And Atreus dying left it to Thyestes rich in flocks, and"
862,BOOK II.,"Thyestes in his turn left it to Agamemnon to bear, that over many"
863,BOOK II.,islands and all Argos he should be lord. Thereon he leaned and spake
864,BOOK II.,his saying to the Argives:
865,BOOK II.,
866,BOOK II.,"* Or, possibly, “the swift-appearing”"
867,BOOK II.,
868,BOOK II.,
869,BOOK II.,"“My friends, Danaan warriors, men of Ares’ company, Zeus Kronos’ son"
870,BOOK II.,hath bound me with might in grievous blindness of soul; hard of heart
871,BOOK II.,"is he, for that erewhile he promised me and pledged his nod that not"
872,BOOK II.,till I had wasted well-walled Ilios should I return; but now see I that
873,BOOK II.,"he planned a cruel wile and biddeth me return to Argos dishonoured,"
874,BOOK II.,with the loss of many of my folk. So meseems it pleaseth most mighty
875,BOOK II.,"Zeus, who hath laid low the head of many a city, yea, and shall lay"
876,BOOK II.,low; for his is highest power. Shame is this even for them that come
877,BOOK II.,after to hear; how so goodly and great a folk of the Achaians thus
878,BOOK II.,"vainly warred a bootless war, and fought scantier enemies, and no end"
879,BOOK II.,"thereof is yet seen. For if perchance we were minded, both Achaians and"
880,BOOK II.,"Trojans, to swear a solemn truce, and to number ourselves, and if the"
881,BOOK II.,Trojans should gather together all that have their dwellings in the
882,BOOK II.,"city, and we Achaians should marshal ourselves by tens, and every"
883,BOOK II.,"company choose a Trojan to pour their wine, then would many tens lack a"
884,BOOK II.,"cup-bearer: so much, I say, do the sons of the Achaians outnumber the"
885,BOOK II.,"Trojans that dwell within the city. But allies from many cities, even"
886,BOOK II.,"warriors that wield the spear, are therein, and they hinder me"
887,BOOK II.,"perforce, and for all my will suffer me not to waste the populous"
888,BOOK II.,"citadel of Ilios. Already have nine years of great Zeus passed away,"
889,BOOK II.,and our ships’ timbers have rotted and the tackling is loosed; while
890,BOOK II.,there our wives and little children sit in our halls awaiting us; yet
891,BOOK II.,"is our task utterly unaccomplished wherefor we came hither. So come,"
892,BOOK II.,even as I bid let us all obey. Let us flee with our ships to our dear
893,BOOK II.,native land; for now shall we never take wide-wayed Troy.”
894,BOOK II.,
895,BOOK II.,"So spake he, and stirred the spirit in the breasts of all throughout"
896,BOOK II.,"the multitude, as many as had not heard the council. And the assembly"
897,BOOK II.,swayed like high sea-waves of the Icarian Main that east wind and south
898,BOOK II.,"wind raise, rushing upon them from the clouds of father Zeus; and even"
899,BOOK II.,as when the west wind cometh to stir a deep cornfield with violent
900,BOOK II.,"blast, and the ears bow down, so was all the assembly stirred, and they"
901,BOOK II.,with shouting hasted toward the ships; and the dust from beneath their
902,BOOK II.,feet rose and stood on high. And they bade each man his neighbor to
903,BOOK II.,"seize the ships and drag them into the bright salt sea, and cleared out"
904,BOOK II.,"the launching-ways, and the noise went up to heaven of their hurrying"
905,BOOK II.,homewards; and they began to take the props from beneath the ships.
906,BOOK II.,
907,BOOK II.,Then would the Argives have accomplished their return against the will
908,BOOK II.,"of fate, but that Hera spake a word to Athene: “Out on it, daughter of"
909,BOOK II.,"aegis-bearing Zeus, unwearied maiden! Shall the Argives thus indeed"
910,BOOK II.,flee homeward to their dear native land over the sea’s broad back? But
911,BOOK II.,"they would leave to Priam and the Trojans their boast, even Helen of"
912,BOOK II.,"Argos, for whose sake many an Achaian hath perished in Troy, far away"
913,BOOK II.,from his dear native land. But go thou now amid the host of the
914,BOOK II.,"mail-clad Achaians; with thy gentle words refrain thou every man,"
915,BOOK II.,neither suffer them to draw their curved ships down to the salt sea.”
916,BOOK II.,
917,BOOK II.,"So spake she, and the bright-eyed goddess Athene disregarded not; but"
918,BOOK II.,"went darting down from the peaks of Olympus, and came with speed to the"
919,BOOK II.,"fleet ships of the Achaians. There found she Odysseus standing, peer of"
920,BOOK II.,"Zeus in counsel, neither laid he any hand upon his decked black ship,"
921,BOOK II.,because grief had entered into his heart and soul. And bright-eyed
922,BOOK II.,"Athene stood by him and said: “Heaven-sprung son of Laertes, Odysseus"
923,BOOK II.,"of many devices, will ye indeed fling yourselves upon your benched"
924,BOOK II.,ships to flee homeward to your dear native land? But ye would leave to
925,BOOK II.,"Priam and the Trojans their boast, even Helen of Argos, for whose sake"
926,BOOK II.,"many an Achaian hath perished in Troy, far from his dear native land."
927,BOOK II.,"But go thou now amid the host of the Achaians, and tarry not; and with"
928,BOOK II.,"gentle words refrain every man, neither suffer them to draw their"
929,BOOK II.,curved ships down to the salt sea.”
930,BOOK II.,
931,BOOK II.,"So said she, and he knew the voice of the goddess speaking to him, and"
932,BOOK II.,"set him to run, and cast away his mantle, the which his herald gathered"
933,BOOK II.,"up, even Eurybates of Ithaca, that waited on him. And himself he went"
934,BOOK II.,"to meet Agamemnon son of Atreus, and at his hand received the sceptre"
935,BOOK II.,"of his sires, imperishable for ever, wherewith he took his way amid the"
936,BOOK II.,ships of the mail-clad Achaians.
937,BOOK II.,
938,BOOK II.,"Whenever he found one that was a captain and a man of mark, he stood by"
939,BOOK II.,"his side, and refrained him with gentle words: “Good sir, it is not"
940,BOOK II.,"seemly to affright thee like a coward, but do thou sit thyself and make"
941,BOOK II.,all thy folk sit down. For thou knowest not yet clearly what is the
942,BOOK II.,"purpose of Atreus’ son; now is he but making trial, and soon he will"
943,BOOK II.,afflict the sons of the Achaians. And heard we not all of us what he
944,BOOK II.,spake in the council? Beware lest in his anger he evilly entreat the
945,BOOK II.,sons of the Achaians. For proud is the soul of heaven-fostered kings;
946,BOOK II.,"because their honour is of Zeus, and the god of counsel loveth them.”*"
947,BOOK II.,
948,BOOK II.,Reading διοτρεφέων βασιλήων with Zenodotos.
949,BOOK II.,
950,BOOK II.,
951,BOOK II.,"But whatever man of the people he saw and found him shouting, him he"
952,BOOK II.,"drave with his sceptre and chode him with loud words: “Good sir, sit"
953,BOOK II.,still and hearken to the words of others that are thy betters; but thou
954,BOOK II.,"art no warrior, and a weakling, never reckoned whether in battle or in"
955,BOOK II.,council. In no wise can we Achaians all be kings here. A multitude of
956,BOOK II.,"masters is no good thing; let there be one master, one king, to whom"
957,BOOK II.,"the son of crooked-counselling Kronos hath granted it, [even the"
958,BOOK II.,"sceptre and judgments, that he may rule among you”]."
959,BOOK II.,
960,BOOK II.,So masterfully ranged he the host; and they hasted back to the assembly
961,BOOK II.,"from ships and huts, with noise as when a wave of loud-sounding sea"
962,BOOK II.,roareth on the long beach and the main resoundeth.
963,BOOK II.,
964,BOOK II.,"Now all the rest sat down and kept their place upon the benches, only"
965,BOOK II.,"Thersites still chattered on, the uncontrolled of speech, whose mind"
966,BOOK II.,"was full of words many and disorderly, wherewith to strive against the"
967,BOOK II.,"chiefs idly and in no good order, but even as he deemed that he should"
968,BOOK II.,make the Argives laugh. And he was ill-favored beyond all men that came
969,BOOK II.,"to Ilios. Bandy-legged was he, and lame of one foot, and his two"
970,BOOK II.,"shoulders rounded, arched down upon his chest; and over them his head"
971,BOOK II.,"was warped, and a scanty stubble sprouted on it. Hateful was he to"
972,BOOK II.,"Achilles above all and to Odysseus, for them he was wont to revile. But"
973,BOOK II.,now with shrill shout he poured forth his upbraidings upon goodly
974,BOOK II.,Agamemnon. With him the Achaians were sore vexed and had indignation in
975,BOOK II.,their souls. But he with loud shout spake and reviled Agamemnon:
976,BOOK II.,"“Atreides, for what art thou now ill content and lacking? Surely thy"
977,BOOK II.,"huts are full of bronze and many women are in they huts, the chosen"
978,BOOK II.,"spoils that we Achaians give thee first of all, whene’er we take a"
979,BOOK II.,"town. Can it be that thou yet wantest gold as well, such as some one of"
980,BOOK II.,"the horse-taming Trojans may bring from Ilios to ransom his son, whom I"
981,BOOK II.,perchance or some other Achaian have led captive; or else some young
982,BOOK II.,"girl, to know in love, whom thou mayest keep apart to thyself? But it"
983,BOOK II.,is not seemly for one that is their captain to bring the sons of the
984,BOOK II.,"Achaians to ill. Soft fools, base things of shame, ye women of Achaia"
985,BOOK II.,"and men no more, let us depart home with our ships, and leave this"
986,BOOK II.,"fellow here in Troy-land to gorge him with meeds of honour, that he may"
987,BOOK II.,see whether our aid avail him aught or no; even he that hath now done
988,BOOK II.,"dishonour to Achilles, a far better man than he; for he hath taken away"
989,BOOK II.,his meed of honour and keepeth it by his own violent deed. Of a very
990,BOOK II.,"surety is there no wrath at all in Achilles’ mind, but he is slack;"
991,BOOK II.,"else this despite, thou son of Atreus, were thy last.”"
992,BOOK II.,
993,BOOK II.,"So spake Thersites, reviling Agamemnon shepherd of the host. But goodly"
994,BOOK II.,"Odysseus came straight to his side, and looking sternly at him with"
995,BOOK II.,"hard words rebuked him: “Thersites, reckless in words, shrill orator"
996,BOOK II.,"though thou art, refrain thyself, nor aim to strive singly against"
997,BOOK II.,kings. For I deem that no mortal is baser than thou of all that with
998,BOOK II.,the sons of Atreus came before Ilios. Therefore were it well that thou
999,BOOK II.,"shouldest not have kings in thy mouth as thou talkest, and utter"
1000,BOOK II.,revilings against them and be on the watch for departure. We know not
1001,BOOK II.,"yet clearly how these things shall be, whether we sons of the Achaians"
1002,BOOK II.,shall return for good or for ill. Therefore now dost thou revile
1003,BOOK II.,"continually Agamemnon son of Atreus, shepherd of the host, because the"
1004,BOOK II.,"Danaan warriors give him many gifts, and so thou talkest tauntingly."
1005,BOOK II.,"But I will tell thee plain, and that I say shall even be brought to"
1006,BOOK II.,"pass: if I find thee again raving as now thou art, then may Odysseus’"
1007,BOOK II.,"head no longer abide upon his shoulders, nor may I any more be called"
1008,BOOK II.,"father of Telemachos, if I take thee not and strip from thee thy"
1009,BOOK II.,"garments, thy mantle and tunic that cover thy nakedness, and for"
1010,BOOK II.,"thyself send thee weeping to the fleet ships, and beat thee out of the"
1011,BOOK II.,assembly with shameful blows.”
1012,BOOK II.,
1013,BOOK II.,"So spake he, and with his staff smote his back and shoulders: and he"
1014,BOOK II.,"bowed down and a big tear fell from him, and a bloody weal stood up"
1015,BOOK II.,from his back beneath the golden sceptre. Then he sat down and was
1016,BOOK II.,"amazed, and in pain with helpless look wiped away the tear. But the"
1017,BOOK II.,"rest, though they were sotty, laughed lightly at him, and thus would"
1018,BOOK II.,"one speak looking at another standing by: “Go to, of a truth Odysseus"
1019,BOOK II.,"hath wrought good deeds without number ere now, standing foremost in"
1020,BOOK II.,"wise counsels and setting battle in array, but now is this thing the"
1021,BOOK II.,"best by far that he hath wrought among the Argives, to wit, that he"
1022,BOOK II.,"hath stayed this prating railer from his harangues. Never again,"
1023,BOOK II.,"forsooth, will his proud soul henceforth bid him revile the kings with"
1024,BOOK II.,slanderous words.”
1025,BOOK II.,
1026,BOOK II.,"So said the common sort; but up rose Odysseus waster of cities, with"
1027,BOOK II.,sceptre in his hand. And by his side bright-eyed Athene in the likeness
1028,BOOK II.,"of a herald bade the multitude keep silence, that the sons of the"
1029,BOOK II.,"Achaians, both the nearest and the farthest, might hear his words"
1030,BOOK II.,together and give heed to his counsel. He of good intent made harangue
1031,BOOK II.,"to them and said: “Atreides, now surely are the Achaians for making"
1032,BOOK II.,"thee, O king, most despised among all mortal men, nor will they fulfil"
1033,BOOK II.,the promise that they pledged thee when they still were marching hither
1034,BOOK II.,from horse-pasturing Argos; that thou shouldest not return till thou
1035,BOOK II.,hadst laid well-walled Ilios waste. For like young children or widow
1036,BOOK II.,"women do they wail each to the other of returning home. Yea, here is"
1037,BOOK II.,toil to make a man depart disheartened. For he that stayeth away but
1038,BOOK II.,one single month far from his wife in his benched ship fretteth himself
1039,BOOK II.,"when winter storms and the furious sea imprison him; but for us, the"
1040,BOOK II.,ninth year of our stay here is upon us in its course. Therefore do I
1041,BOOK II.,not marvel that the Achaians should fret beside their beaked ships; yet
1042,BOOK II.,nevertheless is it shameful to wait long and to depart empty. Be of
1043,BOOK II.,"good heart, my friends, and wait a while, until we learn whether"
1044,BOOK II.,Kalchas be a true prophet or no. For this thing verily we know well in
1045,BOOK II.,"our hearts, and ye all are witnesses thereof, even as many as the fates"
1046,BOOK II.,of death have not borne away. It was as it were but yesterday or the
1047,BOOK II.,"day before that the Achaians’ ships were gathering in Aulis, freighted"
1048,BOOK II.,with trouble for Priam and the Trojans; and we round about a spring
1049,BOOK II.,were offering on the holy altars unblemished hecatombs to the
1050,BOOK II.,"immortals, beneath a fair plane-tree whence flowed bright water, when"
1051,BOOK II.,"there was seen a great portent: a snake blood-red on the back,"
1052,BOOK II.,"terrible, whom the god of Olympus himself had sent forth to the light"
1053,BOOK II.,"of day, sprang from beneath the altar and darted to the plane-tree. Now"
1054,BOOK II.,"there were there the brood of a sparrow, tender little ones, upon the"
1055,BOOK II.,"topmost branch, nestling beneath the leaves; eight were they and the"
1056,BOOK II.,"mother of the little ones was the ninth, and the snake swallowed these"
1057,BOOK II.,cheeping pitifully. And the mother fluttered around wailing for her
1058,BOOK II.,dear little ones; but he coiled himself and caught her by the wing as
1059,BOOK II.,she screamed about him. Now when he had swallowed the sparrow’s little
1060,BOOK II.,"ones and the mother with them, the god who revealed him made of him a"
1061,BOOK II.,"sign; for the son of crooked-counselling Kronos turned him to stone,"
1062,BOOK II.,and we stood by and marvelled to see what was done. So when the dread
1063,BOOK II.,"portent brake in upon the hecatombs of the gods, then did Kalchas"
1064,BOOK II.,"forthwith prophesy, and said: ‘Why hold ye your peace, ye"
1065,BOOK II.,flowing-haired Achaians? To us hath Zeus the counsellor shown this
1066,BOOK II.,"great sign, late come, of late fulfilment, the fame whereof shall never"
1067,BOOK II.,"perish. Even as he swallowed the sparrow’s little ones and herself, the"
1068,BOOK II.,"eight wherewith the mother that bare the little ones was the ninth, so"
1069,BOOK II.,"shall we war there so many years, but in the tenth year shall we take"
1070,BOOK II.,the wide-wayed city.’ So spake the seer; and now are all these things
1071,BOOK II.,"being fulfilled. So come, abide ye all, ye well-greaved Achaians, even"
1072,BOOK II.,"where ye are, until we have taken the great city of Priam.”"
1073,BOOK II.,
1074,BOOK II.,"So spake he, and the Argives shouted aloud, and all round the ships"
1075,BOOK II.,echoed terribly to the voice of the Achaians as they praised the saying
1076,BOOK II.,of god-like Odysseus. And then spake among them knightly Nestor of
1077,BOOK II.,Gerenia: “Out on it; in very truth ye hold assembly like silly boys
1078,BOOK II.,that have no care for deeds of war. What shall come of our covenants
1079,BOOK II.,and our oaths? Let all counsels be cast into the fire and all devices
1080,BOOK II.,of warriors and the pure drink-offerings and the right hands of
1081,BOOK II.,fellowship wherein we trusted. For we are vainly striving with words
1082,BOOK II.,"nor can we find any device at all, for all our long tarrying here. Son"
1083,BOOK II.,"of Atreus, do thou still, as erst, keep steadfast purpose and lead the"
1084,BOOK II.,"Argives amid the violent fray; and for these, let them perish, the one"
1085,BOOK II.,or two Achaians that take secret counsel—though fulfilment shall not
1086,BOOK II.,"come thereof—to depart to Argos first, before they know whether the"
1087,BOOK II.,"promise of aegis-bearing Zeus be a lie or no. Yea, for I say that most"
1088,BOOK II.,mighty Kronion pledged us his word that day when the Argives embarked
1089,BOOK II.,"upon their fleet ships, bearing unto the Trojans death and fate; for by"
1090,BOOK II.,his lightning upon our right he manifested signs of good. Therefore let
1091,BOOK II.,Trojan’s wife and paid back his strivings and groans for Helen’s sake.
1092,BOOK II.,"But if any man is overmuch desirous to depart homewards, let him lay"
1093,BOOK II.,"his hand upon his decked black ship, that before all men he may"
1094,BOOK II.,"encounter death and fate. But do thou, my king, take good counsel"
1095,BOOK II.,"thyself, and hearken to another that shall give it; the word that I"
1096,BOOK II.,"speak, whate’er it be, shall not be cast away. Separate thy warriors by"
1097,BOOK II.,"tribes and by clans, Agamemnon, that clan may give aid to clan and"
1098,BOOK II.,"tribe to tribe. If thou do thus and the Achaians hearken to thee, then"
1099,BOOK II.,wilt thou know who among thy captains and who of the common sort is a
1100,BOOK II.,"coward, and who too is brave; for they will fight each after their"
1101,BOOK II.,sort. So wilt thou know whether it is even by divine command that thou
1102,BOOK II.,"shalt not take the city, or by the baseness of thy warriors and their"
1103,BOOK II.,ill skill in battle.”
1104,BOOK II.,
1105,BOOK II.,And lord Agamemnon answered and said to him: “Verily hast thou again
1106,BOOK II.,"outdone the sons of the Achaians in speech, old man. Ah, father Zeus"
1107,BOOK II.,"and Athene and Apollo, would that among the Achaians I had ten such"
1108,BOOK II.,councillors; then would the city of king Priam soon bow beneath our
1109,BOOK II.,"hands, captive and wasted. But aegis-bearing Zeus, the son of Kronos,"
1110,BOOK II.,"hath brought sorrows upon me, in that he casteth my lot amid fruitless"
1111,BOOK II.,wranglings and strifes. For in truth I and Achilles fought about a
1112,BOOK II.,"damsel with violent words, and I was first to be angry; but if we can"
1113,BOOK II.,"only be at one in council, then will there no more be any putting off"
1114,BOOK II.,"the day of evil for the Trojans, no not for an instant. But now go ye"
1115,BOOK II.,to your meal that we may join battle. Let each man sharpen well his
1116,BOOK II.,"spear and bestow well his shield, and let him well give his"
1117,BOOK II.,"fleet-footed steeds their meal, and look well to his chariot on every"
1118,BOOK II.,"side and take thought for battle, that all day long we may contend in"
1119,BOOK II.,"hateful war. For of respite shall there intervene no, not a whit, only"
1120,BOOK II.,that the coming of night shall part the fury of warriors. On each man’s
1121,BOOK II.,"breast shall the baldrick of his covering shield be wet with sweat, and"
1122,BOOK II.,"his hand shall grow faint about the spear, and each man’s horse shall"
1123,BOOK II.,sweat as he draweth the polished chariot. And whomsoever I perceive
1124,BOOK II.,"minded to tarry far from the fight beside the beaked ships, for him"
1125,BOOK II.,shall there be no hope hereafter to escape the dogs and birds of prey.”
1126,BOOK II.,
1127,BOOK II.,"So spake he, and the Argives shouted aloud, like to a wave on a steep"
1128,BOOK II.,"shore, when the south wind cometh and stirreth it; even on a jutting"
1129,BOOK II.,"rock, that is never left at peace by the waves of all winds that rise"
1130,BOOK II.,from this side and from that. And they stood up and scattered in haste
1131,BOOK II.,"throughout the ships, and made fires in the huts and took their meal."
1132,BOOK II.,"And they did sacrifice each man to one of the everlasting gods, praying"
1133,BOOK II.,for escape from death and the tumult of battle. But Agamemnon king of
1134,BOOK II.,"men slew a fat bull of five years to most mighty Kronion, and called"
1135,BOOK II.,"the elders, the princes of the Achaian host, Nestor first and king"
1136,BOOK II.,"Idomeneus, and then the two Aiantes and Tydeus’ son, and sixthly"
1137,BOOK II.,Odysseus peer of Zeus in counsel. And Menelaos of the loud war-cry came
1138,BOOK II.,"to him unbidden, for he knew in his heart how his brother toiled. Then"
1139,BOOK II.,stood they around the bull and took the barley-meal. And Agamemnon made
1140,BOOK II.,"his prayer in their midst and said: “Zeus, most glorious, most great,"
1141,BOOK II.,"god of the storm-cloud, that dwellest in the heaven, vouchsafe that the"
1142,BOOK II.,"sun set not upon us nor the darkness come near, till I have laid low"
1143,BOOK II.,"upon the earth Priam’s palace smirched with smoke, and burnt the"
1144,BOOK II.,"doorways thereof with consuming fire, and rent on Hector’s breast his"
1145,BOOK II.,doublet cleft with the blade; and about him may full many of his
1146,BOOK II.,comrades prone in the dust bite the earth.”
1147,BOOK II.,
1148,BOOK II.,"So spake he, but not as yet would Kronion grant him fulfilment; he"
1149,BOOK II.,"accepted the sacrifice, but made toil to wax increasingly."
1150,BOOK II.,
1151,BOOK II.,Now when they had prayed and sprinkled the barley-meal they first drew
1152,BOOK II.,"back the bull’s head and cut his throat and flayed him, and cut slices"
1153,BOOK II.,"from the thighs and wrapped them in fat, making a double fold, and laid"
1154,BOOK II.,raw collops thereon. And these they burnt on cleft wood stript of
1155,BOOK II.,"leaves, and spitted the vitals and held them over Hephaistos’ flame."
1156,BOOK II.,"Now when the thighs were burnt and they had tasted the vitals, then"
1157,BOOK II.,"sliced they all the rest and pierced it through with spits, and roasted"
1158,BOOK II.,it carefully and drew all off again. So when they had rest from the
1159,BOOK II.,"task and had made ready the banquet, they feasted, nor was their heart"
1160,BOOK II.,aught stinted of the fair banquet. But when they had put away from them
1161,BOOK II.,"the desire of meat and drink, then did knightly Nestor of Gerenia open"
1162,BOOK II.,"his saying to them: “Most noble son of Atreus, Agamemnon king of men,"
1163,BOOK II.,"let us not any more hold long converse here, nor for long delay the"
1164,BOOK II.,"work that god putteth in our hands; but come, let the heralds of the"
1165,BOOK II.,mail-clad Achaians make proclamation to the folk and gather them
1166,BOOK II.,throughout the ships; and let us go thus in concert through the wide
1167,BOOK II.,"host of the Achaians, that the speedier we may arouse keen war.”"
1168,BOOK II.,
1169,BOOK II.,So spake he and Agamemnon king of men disregarded not. Straightway he
1170,BOOK II.,bade the clear-voiced heralds summon to battle the flowing-haired
1171,BOOK II.,Achaians. So those summoned and these gathered with all speed. And the
1172,BOOK II.,"kings, the fosterlings of Zeus that were about Atreus’ son, eagerly"
1173,BOOK II.,"marshalled them, and bright-eyed Athene in the midst, bearing the holy"
1174,BOOK II.,"aegis that knoweth neither age nor death, whereon wave an hundred"
1175,BOOK II.,"tassels of pure gold, all deftly woven and each one an hundred oxen"
1176,BOOK II.,"worth. Therewith she passed dazzling through the Achaian folk, urging"
1177,BOOK II.,them forth; and in every man’s heart she roused strength to battle
1178,BOOK II.,without ceasing and to fight. So was war made sweeter to them than to
1179,BOOK II.,depart in their hollow ships to their dear native land. Even as
1180,BOOK II.,"ravaging fire kindleth a boundless forest on a mountain’s peaks, and"
1181,BOOK II.,"the blaze is seen from afar, even so as they marched went the dazzling"
1182,BOOK II.,gleam from the innumerable bronze through the sky even unto the
1183,BOOK II.,heavens.
1184,BOOK II.,
1185,BOOK II.,"And as the many tribes of feathered birds, wild geese or cranes or"
1186,BOOK II.,"long-necked swans, on the Asian mead by Kaystrios’ stream, fly hither"
1187,BOOK II.,"and thither joying in their plumage, and with loud cries settle ever"
1188,BOOK II.,"onwards, and the mead resounds; even so poured forth the many tribes of"
1189,BOOK II.,warriors from ships and huts into the Skamandrian plain. And the earth
1190,BOOK II.,echoed terribly beneath the tread of men and horses. So stood they in
1191,BOOK II.,"the flowery Skamandrian plain, unnumbered as are leaves and flowers in"
1192,BOOK II.,their season. Even as the many tribes of thick flies that hover about a
1193,BOOK II.,"herdsman’s steading in the spring season, when milk drencheth the"
1194,BOOK II.,"pails, even in like number stood the flowing-haired Achaians upon the"
1195,BOOK II.,"plain in face of the Trojans, eager to rend them asunder. And even as"
1196,BOOK II.,the goatherds easily divide the ranging flocks of goats when they
1197,BOOK II.,"mingle in the pasture, so did their captains marshal them on this side"
1198,BOOK II.,"and that, to enter into the fray, and in their midst lord Agamemnon,"
1199,BOOK II.,"his head and eyes like unto Zeus whose joy is in the thunder, and his"
1200,BOOK II.,waist like unto Ares and his breast unto Poseidon. Even as a bull
1201,BOOK II.,"standeth out far foremost amid the herd, for he is pre-eminent amid the"
1202,BOOK II.,"pasturing kine, even such did Zeus make Atreides on that day,"
1203,BOOK II.,pre-eminent among many and chief amid heroes.
1204,BOOK II.,
1205,BOOK II.,"Tell me now, ye Muses that dwell in the mansions of Olympus—seeing that"
1206,BOOK II.,"ye are goddesses and are at hand and know all things, but we hear only"
1207,BOOK II.,a rumour and know not anything—who were the captains of the Danaans and
1208,BOOK II.,"their lords. But the common sort could I not number nor name, nay, not"
1209,BOOK II.,"if ten tongues were mine and ten mouths, and a voice unwearied, and my"
1210,BOOK II.,"heart of bronze within me, did not the Muses of Olympus, daughters of"
1211,BOOK II.,"aegis-bearing Zeus, put into my mind all that came to Ilios. So will I"
1212,BOOK II.,tell the captains of the ships and all the ships in order.
1213,BOOK II.,
1214,BOOK II.,"Of the Boiotians Peneleos and Leitos were captains, and Arkesilaos and"
1215,BOOK II.,Prothoënor and Klonios; these were they that dwelt in Hyria and rocky
1216,BOOK II.,"Aulis and Schoinos and Skolos and Eteonos full of ridges, Thespeia and"
1217,BOOK II.,Graia and Mykalessos with wide lawns; and that dwelt about Harma and
1218,BOOK II.,"Eilesion and Erythrai, and they that possessed Eleon and Peteon and"
1219,BOOK II.,"Hyle, Okalea and the stablished fortress of Medeon, Kopai and Eutresis"
1220,BOOK II.,"and Thisbe haunt of doves; and they of Koroneia and grassy Haliartos,"
1221,BOOK II.,"and that possessed Plataia and that dwelt in Glisas, and that possessed"
1222,BOOK II.,"the stablished fortress of lesser Thebes and holy Onchestos, Poseidon’s"
1223,BOOK II.,"bright grove; and that possessed Arne rich in vineyards, and Mideia and"
1224,BOOK II.,sacred Nisa and Anthedon on the furthest borders. Of these there came
1225,BOOK II.,"fifty ships, and in each one embarked young men of the Boiotians an"
1226,BOOK II.,hundred and twenty. And they that dwelt in Aspledon and Orchomenos of
1227,BOOK II.,"the Minyai were led of Askalaphos and Ialmenos, sons of Ares, whom"
1228,BOOK II.,Astyoche conceived of the mighty god in the palace of Aktor son of
1229,BOOK II.,"Azeus, having entered her upper chamber, a stately maiden; for mighty"
1230,BOOK II.,Ares lay with her privily. And with them sailed thirty hollow ships.
1231,BOOK II.,
1232,BOOK II.,"And the Phokians were led of Schedios and Epistrophos, sons of"
1233,BOOK II.,great-hearted Iphitos son of Naubolos; these were they that possessed
1234,BOOK II.,"Kyparissos and rocky Pytho and sacred Krisa and Daulis and Panopeus,"
1235,BOOK II.,"and they that dwelt about Anemoreia and Hyampolis, yea, and they that"
1236,BOOK II.,lived by the goodly river Kephisos and possessed Lilaia by Kephisos’
1237,BOOK II.,springs. And with them followed forty black ships. So they marshalled
1238,BOOK II.,"the ranks of the Phokians diligently, and had their station hard by the"
1239,BOOK II.,Boiotians on the left.
1240,BOOK II.,
1241,BOOK II.,"And of the Lokrians the fleet son of Oileus was captain, Aias the less,"
1242,BOOK II.,that was not so great as was the Telamonian Aias but far less. Small
1243,BOOK II.,"was he, with linen corslet, but with the spear he far outdid all the"
1244,BOOK II.,Hellenes and Achaians. These were they that dwelt in Kynos and Opus and
1245,BOOK II.,Kalliaros and Bessa and Skarphe and lovely Augeiai and Tarphe and
1246,BOOK II.,"Thronion, about the streams of Boagrios. And with Aias followed forty"
1247,BOOK II.,black ships of the Lokrians that dwell over against holy Euboia.
1248,BOOK II.,
1249,BOOK II.,"And the Abantes breathing fury, they that possessed Euboia and Chalkis"
1250,BOOK II.,"and Eiretria and Histiaia rich in vines, and Kerinthos by the sea and"
1251,BOOK II.,"the steep fortress of Dios, and they that possessed Karytos, and they"
1252,BOOK II.,"that dwelt in Styra, all these again were led of Elephenor of the stock"
1253,BOOK II.,"of Ares, even the son of Chalkodon, and captain of the proud Abantes."
1254,BOOK II.,"And with him followed the fleet Abantes with hair flowing behind,"
1255,BOOK II.,spearmen eager with ashen shafts outstretched to tear the corslets on
1256,BOOK II.,the breasts of the foes. And with him forty black ships followed.
1257,BOOK II.,
1258,BOOK II.,"And they that possessed the goodly citadel of Athens, the domain of"
1259,BOOK II.,"Erechtheus the high-hearted, whom erst Athene daughter of Zeus fostered"
1260,BOOK II.,"when Earth, the grain-giver, brought him to birth;—and she gave him a"
1261,BOOK II.,resting-place in Athens in her own rich sanctuary; and there the sons
1262,BOOK II.,of the Athenians worship him with bulls and rams as the years turn in
1263,BOOK II.,their courses—these again were led of Menestheus son of Peteos. And
1264,BOOK II.,there was no man upon the face of earth that was like him for the
1265,BOOK II.,marshalling of horsemen and warriors that bear the shield. Only Nestor
1266,BOOK II.,"rivalled him, for he was the elder by birth. And with him rivalled him,"
1267,BOOK II.,for he was the elder by birth. And with him fifty black ships followed.
1268,BOOK II.,
1269,BOOK II.,"And Aias led twelve ships from Salamis, [and brought them and set them"
1270,BOOK II.,where the battalions of the Athenians stood.]
1271,BOOK II.,
1272,BOOK II.,"And they that possessed Argos and Tiryns of the great walls, Hermione"
1273,BOOK II.,"and Asine that enfold the deep gulf, Troizen and Eïonai and Epidauros"
1274,BOOK II.,"full of vines, and the youths of the Achaians that possessed Aigina and"
1275,BOOK II.,"Mases, these were led of Diomedes of the loud war-cry and Sthenelos,"
1276,BOOK II.,"dear son of famous Kapaneus. And the third with them came Euryalos, a"
1277,BOOK II.,"godlike warrior, the son of king Mekisteus son of Talaos. But Diomedes"
1278,BOOK II.,of the loud war-cry was lord over all. And with them eighty black ships
1279,BOOK II.,followed.
1280,BOOK II.,
1281,BOOK II.,And of them that possessed the stablished fortress of Mykene and
1282,BOOK II.,"wealthy Corinth and stablished Kleonai, and dwelt in Orneiai and lovely"
1283,BOOK II.,"Araithyrea and Sikyon, wherein Adrestos was king at the first; and of"
1284,BOOK II.,"them that possessed Hyperesie and steep Gonoessa and Pellene, and dwelt"
1285,BOOK II.,"about Aigion and through all the coast-land and about broad Helike, of"
1286,BOOK II.,them did lord Agamemnon son of Atreus lead an hundred ships. With him
1287,BOOK II.,followed most and goodliest folk by far; and in their midst himself was
1288,BOOK II.,"clad in flashing bronze, all glorious, and was pre-eminent amid all"
1289,BOOK II.,"warriors, because he was goodliest and led folk far greatest in number."
1290,BOOK II.,
1291,BOOK II.,"And of them that possessed Lakedaimon lying low amid the rifted hills,"
1292,BOOK II.,"and Pharis and Sparta and Messe, the haunt of doves, and dwelt in"
1293,BOOK II.,"Bryseiai and lovely Augeiai, and of them too that possessed Amyklai and"
1294,BOOK II.,"the sea-coast fortress of Helos, and that possessed Laas and dwelt"
1295,BOOK II.,"about Oitylos, of these was the king’s brother leader, even Menelaos of"
1296,BOOK II.,"the loud war-cry, leader of sixty ships, and these were arrayed apart."
1297,BOOK II.,"And himself marched among them confident in his zeal, urging his men to"
1298,BOOK II.,battle: and his heart most of all was set to take vengeance for his
1299,BOOK II.,strivings and groans for Helen’s sake.*
1300,BOOK II.,
1301,BOOK II.,"* Or, “for Helen’s searchings of heart and groans.”"
1302,BOOK II.,
1303,BOOK II.,
1304,BOOK II.,And of them that dwelt in Pylos and lovely Arene and Thryon the
1305,BOOK II.,"fording-place of Alpheios, and in established Aipy, and were"
1306,BOOK II.,inhabitants of Kyparisseis and Amphigeneia and Pteleos and Helos and
1307,BOOK II.,"Dorion—where the Muses met Thamyris the Thracian, and made an end of"
1308,BOOK II.,"his singing, as he was faring from Oichalia, from Eurytos the"
1309,BOOK II.,"Oichalian; for he averred with boasting that he would conquer, even did"
1310,BOOK II.,"the Muses themselves sing against him, the daughters of aegis-bearing"
1311,BOOK II.,"Zeus; but they in their anger maimed him, moreover they took from him"
1312,BOOK II.,the high gift of song and made him to forget his harping—of all these
1313,BOOK II.,"was knightly Nestor of Gerenia leader, and with him sailed ninety"
1314,BOOK II.,hollow ships.
1315,BOOK II.,
1316,BOOK II.,And of them that possessed Arkadia beneath the steep mountain of
1317,BOOK II.,"Kyllene, beside the tomb of Aipytos, where are warriors that fight hand"
1318,BOOK II.,to hand; and of them that dwelt in Pheneos and Orchomenos abounding in
1319,BOOK II.,"flocks, and Rhipe and Stratie and windy Enispe, and that possessed"
1320,BOOK II.,"Tegea and lovely Mantineia, and possessed Stymphelos and dwelt in"
1321,BOOK II.,"Parrhasie, of these was Ankaios’ son lord Agapenor leader, even of"
1322,BOOK II.,sixty ships; and in each ship embarked many Arkadian warriors skilled
1323,BOOK II.,in fight. For Agamemnon king of men himself gave them benched ships
1324,BOOK II.,"wherewith to cross the wine-dark sea, even he the son of Atreus; for"
1325,BOOK II.,matters of seafaring concerned them not.
1326,BOOK II.,
1327,BOOK II.,"And they too that inhabited Bouprasion and goodly Elis, so much thereof"
1328,BOOK II.,as Hyrmine and Myrsinos upon the borders and the Olenian rock and
1329,BOOK II.,"Aleision bound between them, of these men there were four captains, and"
1330,BOOK II.,"ten swift ships followed each one, and many Epeians embarked thereon."
1331,BOOK II.,"So some were led of Amphimachos and Thalpios, of the lineage of Aktor,"
1332,BOOK II.,sons one of Kteatos and one of Eurytos; and of some was stalwart Diores
1333,BOOK II.,"captain, son of Amarynkes; and of the fourth company godlike Polyxeinos"
1334,BOOK II.,"was captain, son of king Agasthenes Augeias’ son."
1335,BOOK II.,
1336,BOOK II.,And them of Doulichion and the holy Echinean Isles that stand beyond
1337,BOOK II.,"the sea over against Elis, even these did Meges lead, the peer of Ares,"
1338,BOOK II.,"Phyleides to wit, for he was begotten of knightly Phyleus dear to Zeus,"
1339,BOOK II.,him that erst changed his habitation to Doulichion for anger against
1340,BOOK II.,his father. And with him followed forty black ships.
1341,BOOK II.,
1342,BOOK II.,"And Odysseus led the great-hearted Kephallenians, them that possessed"
1343,BOOK II.,"Ithaka and Neriton with quivering leafage, and dwelt in Krokyleia and"
1344,BOOK II.,"rugged Aigilips, and them that possessed Zakynthos and that dwelt in"
1345,BOOK II.,"Samos, and possessed the mainland and dwelt in the parts over against"
1346,BOOK II.,"the isles. Them did Odysseus lead, the peer of Zeus in counsel, and"
1347,BOOK II.,with him followed twelve ships with vermillion prow.
1348,BOOK II.,
1349,BOOK II.,"And of the Aitolians Thoas was captain, the son of Andraimon, even of"
1350,BOOK II.,"them that dwelt in Pleuron and Olenos and Pylene, and Chalkis on the"
1351,BOOK II.,sea-shore and rocky Kalydon. For the sons of great-hearted Oineus were
1352,BOOK II.,"no more, neither did he still live, and golden-haired Meleagros was"
1353,BOOK II.,"dead, to whose hands all had been committed, for him to be king of the"
1354,BOOK II.,Aitolians. And with Thoas there followed forty black ships.
1355,BOOK II.,
1356,BOOK II.,"And of the Cretans Idomeneus the famous spearman was leader, even of"
1357,BOOK II.,"them that possessed Knosos and Gortys of the great walls, Lyktos and"
1358,BOOK II.,"Miletos and chalky Lykastos and Phaistos and Rhytion, stablished cities"
1359,BOOK II.,all; and of all others that dwelt in Crete of the hundred cities. Of
1360,BOOK II.,"these men was Idomeneus the famous spearman leader, and Meriones peer"
1361,BOOK II.,of the man-slaying war-god. With these followed eighty black ships.
1362,BOOK II.,
1363,BOOK II.,"And Tlepolemmos, Herakles’ son goodly and tall, led from Rhodes nine"
1364,BOOK II.,"ships of the lordly Rhodians, that dwelt in Rhodes in threefold"
1365,BOOK II.,"ordering, in Lindos and Ialysos and chalky Kameiros. These were led of"
1366,BOOK II.,"Tlepolemos the famous spearman, that was born to great Herakles by"
1367,BOOK II.,"Astyocheia, whom he had brought away from Ephyre by the river Selleëis,"
1368,BOOK II.,"when he laid waste many cities of strong men, fosterlings of Zeus. Now"
1369,BOOK II.,"when Tlepolemos had grown to manhood within the strong palace walls,"
1370,BOOK II.,"anon he slew his own father’s dear uncle, an old man now, Likymnios of"
1371,BOOK II.,the stock of Ares. Then with speed built he ships and gathered much
1372,BOOK II.,"folk together, and went fleeing across the deep, because the other sons"
1373,BOOK II.,and grandsons of great Herakles threatened him. So he came to Rhodes a
1374,BOOK II.,"wanderer, enduring hardships, and his folk settled by kinship in three"
1375,BOOK II.,"tribes, and were loved of Zeus that is king among gods and men; and"
1376,BOOK II.,Kronion poured upon them exceeding great wealth.
1377,BOOK II.,
1378,BOOK II.,"Nireus, moreover, led three trim ships from Syme, Nireus son of Aglaia"
1379,BOOK II.,"and king Charopos, Nireus the most beauteous man that came up under"
1380,BOOK II.,"Ilios of all the Danaans, after the noble son of Peleus. Howbeit he was"
1381,BOOK II.,"a weakling, and a scanty host followed him."
1382,BOOK II.,
1383,BOOK II.,And of them that possessed Nisyros and Krapathos and Kasos and Kos the
1384,BOOK II.,"city of Eurypylos, and the Kalydnian Isles, of them Pheidippos and"
1385,BOOK II.,"Antiphos were leaders, the two sons of king Thessalos son of Herakles."
1386,BOOK II.,With them were arrayed thirty hollow ships.
1387,BOOK II.,
1388,BOOK II.,Now all moreover that dwelt in the Pelasgian Argos and inhabited Alos
1389,BOOK II.,and Alope and Trachis and possessed Phthia and Hellas the home of fair
1390,BOOK II.,"women, and were called Myrmidons and Hellenes and Achaians; of all"
1391,BOOK II.,"these, even fifty ships, Achilles was captain. But these took no"
1392,BOOK II.,thought of noisy war; for there was no man to array them in line of
1393,BOOK II.,"battle. For fleet-footed goodly Achilles lay idle amid the ships, wroth"
1394,BOOK II.,"for the sake of a damsel, Briseis of the lovely hair, whom he had won"
1395,BOOK II.,"from Lyrnessos with much travail, what time he laid waste Lyrnessos and"
1396,BOOK II.,"the walls of Thebe, and overthrew Mynes and Epistrophos, warriors that"
1397,BOOK II.,"bare the spear, sons of king Euenos Selepos’ son. For her sake lay"
1398,BOOK II.,Achilles sorrowing; but soon was he to arise again.
1399,BOOK II.,
1400,BOOK II.,"And of them that possessed Phylake and flowery Pyrasos, Demeter’s"
1401,BOOK II.,"sanctuary, and Iton mother of flocks, and Antron by the sea-shore and"
1402,BOOK II.,"Pteleos couched in grass, of all these was warlike Protesilaos leader"
1403,BOOK II.,while yet he lived; but now ere this the black earth held him fast. His
1404,BOOK II.,"wife with marred visage was left alone in Phylake, yea, and his bridal"
1405,BOOK II.,chamber half builded; for a Dardanian warrior slew him as he leapt from
1406,BOOK II.,his ship far first of the Achaians. Yet neither were his men
1407,BOOK II.,"leaderless, though they sorrowed for their leader; for Podarkes of the"
1408,BOOK II.,"stock of Ares marshalled them, son of Phylakos’ son Iphiklos was he,"
1409,BOOK II.,"the lord of many flocks, own brother of great-hearted Protesilaos, and"
1410,BOOK II.,"younger-born than he: but the other was alike the elder and the braver,"
1411,BOOK II.,"even Protesilaos, that mighty man of war. Yet did not the host lack at"
1412,BOOK II.,"all a leader, only they yearned for the noble dead. With him followed"
1413,BOOK II.,forty black ships.
1414,BOOK II.,
1415,BOOK II.,"And of them that dwelt in Pherai by the Boibeian mere, in Boibe and"
1416,BOOK II.,"Glaphyre and stablished Iolkos, of them, even eleven ships, Admetos’"
1417,BOOK II.,"dear son was leader, Eumelos whom Alkestis, fair among women, bare to"
1418,BOOK II.,"Admetos, she that was most beauteous to look upon of the daughters of"
1419,BOOK II.,Pelias.
1420,BOOK II.,
1421,BOOK II.,"And of them that dwelt in Methone and Thaumakie, and possessed Meliboia"
1422,BOOK II.,"and rugged Olizon, of these, even seven ships, was Philoktetes leader,"
1423,BOOK II.,the cunning archer; and in each ship sailed fifty oarsmen skilled to
1424,BOOK II.,fight amain with the bow. But their captain lay enduring sore pain in
1425,BOOK II.,"the isle of goodly Lemnos, where the sons of the Achaians left him sick"
1426,BOOK II.,of a grievous wound from a deadly water-snake. There lay he pining; yet
1427,BOOK II.,were the Argives soon to bethink them beside their ships of king
1428,BOOK II.,"Philoktetes. Yet neither were his men leaderless, only they sorrowed"
1429,BOOK II.,"for their leader; but Medon marshalled them, Oileus’ bastard son, whom"
1430,BOOK II.,Rhene bare to Oileus waster of cities.
1431,BOOK II.,
1432,BOOK II.,And of them that possessed Trikke and terraced Ithome and that
1433,BOOK II.,"possessed Oichalia city of Eurytos the Oichalian, of these again"
1434,BOOK II.,"Asklepios’ two sons were leaders, the cunning leeches Podaleirios and"
1435,BOOK II.,Machaon. And with them were arrayed thirty hollow ships.
1436,BOOK II.,
1437,BOOK II.,"And of them that possessed Ormenios and the fountain of Hypereia, and"
1438,BOOK II.,"possessed Asterion and the white crests of Titanos, of these was"
1439,BOOK II.,"Eurypylos leader, Euaimon’s glorious son; and with him forty black"
1440,BOOK II.,ships followed.
1441,BOOK II.,
1442,BOOK II.,"And of them that possessed Argissa and dwelt in Gyrtona, Orthe and"
1443,BOOK II.,"Elone and the white city of Oloosson, of these was captain unflinching"
1444,BOOK II.,"Polypoites, son of Peirithoos that immortal Zeus begat: and Polypoites"
1445,BOOK II.,did famed Hippodameia conceive of Peirithoos on that day when he took
1446,BOOK II.,"vengeance of the shaggy wild folk, and thrust them forth from Pelion"
1447,BOOK II.,"and drave them to the Aithikes. And Polypoites ruled not alone, but"
1448,BOOK II.,"with him was Leonteus of the stock of Ares, son of high-hearted Koronos"
1449,BOOK II.,Kaineus’s son. And with them forty black ships followed.
1450,BOOK II.,
1451,BOOK II.,"And Gouneus from Kyphos led two-and-twenty ships, and with him followed"
1452,BOOK II.,the Enienes and unflinching Peraibians that had pitched their homes
1453,BOOK II.,"about wintry Dodona, and dwelt on the tilth about lovely Titaresios"
1454,BOOK II.,that poureth his fair-flowing stream into Peneios. Yet doth he not
1455,BOOK II.,"mingle with the silver eddies of Peneios, but floweth on over him like"
1456,BOOK II.,"unto oil, seeing that he is an offspring from the water of Styx, the"
1457,BOOK II.,dread river of the oath.
1458,BOOK II.,
1459,BOOK II.,"And the Magnetes were led of Prothoos son of Tenthredon, even they that"
1460,BOOK II.,dwelt about Peneios and Pelion with trembling leafage. These did fleet
1461,BOOK II.,"Prothoos lead, and with him forty black ships followed."
1462,BOOK II.,
1463,BOOK II.,So these were the leaders of the Danaans and their captains. Now tell
1464,BOOK II.,"me, O Muse, who among them was first and foremost, of warriors alike"
1465,BOOK II.,and horses that followed the sons of Atreus. Of horses they of Pheres’
1466,BOOK II.,"son were far goodliest, those that Eumelos drave, swift as birds, like"
1467,BOOK II.,"of coat, like of age, matched to the measure of a levelling line across"
1468,BOOK II.,"their backs. These were reared in Peraia by Apollo of the silver bow,"
1469,BOOK II.,two mares carrying onward the terror of battle. But of warriors far
1470,BOOK II.,"best was the Telamonian Aias, while the wrath of Achilles yet endured;"
1471,BOOK II.,"for he was greatest of all, he and his horses that bore him, even"
1472,BOOK II.,"Peleus’ noble son. But he lay idle among his seafaring ships, in sore"
1473,BOOK II.,"wrath against Agamemnon Atreus’ son, shepherd of the host; and his folk"
1474,BOOK II.,along the sea-shore sported with quoits and with casting of javelins
1475,BOOK II.,"and archery; and the horses each beside his own chariot stood idle,"
1476,BOOK II.,"champing clover and parsley of the marsh, and their lords’ chariots lay"
1477,BOOK II.,"well covered up within the huts, while the men yearned for their"
1478,BOOK II.,"warrior chief, and wandered hither and thither through the camp and"
1479,BOOK II.,fought not.
1480,BOOK II.,
1481,BOOK II.,So marched they then as though all the land were consuming with fire;
1482,BOOK II.,and the earth groaned beneath them as at the wrath of Zeus whose joy is
1483,BOOK II.,"in the thunder, when he lasheth the earth about Typhoeus in the country"
1484,BOOK II.,"of the Arimoi, where men say is Typhoeus’ couch. Even so groaned the"
1485,BOOK II.,earth aloud at their tread as they went: and with speed advanced they
1486,BOOK II.,across the plain.
1487,BOOK II.,
1488,BOOK II.,"Now fleet Iris the wind-footed went to the Trojans, a messenger from"
1489,BOOK II.,"aegis-bearing Zeus, with a grievous message. These were holding"
1490,BOOK II.,"assembly at Priam’s gate, being gathered all together both young men"
1491,BOOK II.,and old. And fleet-footed Iris stood hard by and spake to them; and she
1492,BOOK II.,"made her voice like to the voice of Polites son of Priam, who was the"
1493,BOOK II.,sentinel of the Trojans and was wont to sit trusting in his fleetness
1494,BOOK II.,"upon the barrow of Aisyetes of old, and on the top thereof wait the"
1495,BOOK II.,sallying of the Achaians forth from their ships. Even in his likeness
1496,BOOK II.,"did fleet-footed Iris speak to Priam: “Old man, words beyond number are"
1497,BOOK II.,still pleasant to thee as erst in the days of peace; but war without
1498,BOOK II.,respite is upon us. Of a truth have I very oft ere now entered into
1499,BOOK II.,"battles of the warriors, yet have I never seen so goodly a host and so"
1500,BOOK II.,great; for in the very likeness of the leaves of the forest or the
1501,BOOK II.,sands of the sea are they marching along the plain to fight against the
1502,BOOK II.,"city. But Hector, thee do I charge beyond all to do even as I shall"
1503,BOOK II.,say. Seeing that the allies are very many throughout Priam’s great
1504,BOOK II.,"city, and diverse men, being scattered abroad, have diverse tongues;"
1505,BOOK II.,"therefore let each one give the word to those whose chieftain he is,"
1506,BOOK II.,and them let him lead forth and have the ordering of his countrymen.”
1507,BOOK II.,
1508,BOOK II.,"So spake she, and Hector failed not to know the voice of the goddess,"
1509,BOOK II.,"and straightway dismissed the assembly, and they rushed to arms. And"
1510,BOOK II.,"the gates were thrown open wide, and the host issued forth, footmen and"
1511,BOOK II.,"horsemen, and mighty din arose."
1512,BOOK II.,
1513,BOOK II.,"Now there is before the city a certain steep mound apart in the plain,"
1514,BOOK II.,with a clear way about it on this side and on that; and men indeed call
1515,BOOK II.,"this “Batieia,” but the immortals call it “The tomb of lithe Myrine.”"
1516,BOOK II.,There did the Trojans and their allies divide their companies.
1517,BOOK II.,
1518,BOOK II.,"Amid the Trojans great Hector of the glancing helm was leader, the son"
1519,BOOK II.,of Priam; with him the greatest hosts by far and the goodliest were
1520,BOOK II.,"arrayed, eager warriors of the spear."
1521,BOOK II.,
1522,BOOK II.,"But the Dardanians were led of the princely son of Anchises, Aineias,"
1523,BOOK II.,"whom bright Aphrodite conceived to Anchises amids the spurs of Ida, a"
1524,BOOK II.,goddess wedded to a mortal. Neither was he alone; with him were
1525,BOOK II.,"Antenor’s two sons, Archelochos and Akamas, well skilled in all the"
1526,BOOK II.,ways of war.
1527,BOOK II.,
1528,BOOK II.,"And of them that dwelt in Zeleia beneath the nethermost foot of Ida,"
1529,BOOK II.,"the men of substance that drink the dark waters of Aisepos, even the"
1530,BOOK II.,"Troes; of these Lykaon’s glorious son was leader, Pandaros, to whom"
1531,BOOK II.,Apollo himself gave the bow.
1532,BOOK II.,
1533,BOOK II.,And of them that possessed Adresteia and the land of Apaisos and
1534,BOOK II.,"possessed Pityeia and the steep hill of Tereia, of these Adrestos was"
1535,BOOK II.,"captain, and Amphios of the linen corslet, the two sons of Merops of"
1536,BOOK II.,"Perkote, that beyond all men knew soothsaying, and would have hindered"
1537,BOOK II.,"his children marching to murderous war. But they gave him no heed, for"
1538,BOOK II.,the fates of black death led them on.
1539,BOOK II.,
1540,BOOK II.,And they that dwelt about Perkote and Praktios and possessed Sestos and
1541,BOOK II.,"Abydos and bright Arisbe, these were led of Hyrtakos’ son Asios, a"
1542,BOOK II.,"prince of men, Asios son of Hyrtakos, whom his tall sorrel steeds"
1543,BOOK II.,"brought from Arisbe, from the river Selleëis."
1544,BOOK II.,
1545,BOOK II.,"And Hippothoos led the tribes of the Pelasgians that fight with spears,"
1546,BOOK II.,them that inhabited deep-soiled Larisa. These were led of Hippothoos
1547,BOOK II.,"and Pylaios of the stock of Ares, twain sons of Pelasgian Lethos son of"
1548,BOOK II.,Teutamos.
1549,BOOK II.,
1550,BOOK II.,"And the Thracians were led of Akamas and hero Peiroos, even all they"
1551,BOOK II.,that the strong stream of Hellespont shutteth in. And Euphemos was
1552,BOOK II.,"captain of the Kikonian spearmen, the son of Troizenos Keos’ son,"
1553,BOOK II.,fosterling of Zeus.
1554,BOOK II.,
1555,BOOK II.,"But Pyraichmes led the Paionians with curving bows, from far away in"
1556,BOOK II.,"Amydon, from the broad stream of Axios, Axios whose water is the"
1557,BOOK II.,fairest that floweth over the face of the earth.
1558,BOOK II.,
1559,BOOK II.,And Pylaimenes of rugged heart led the Paphlagonians from the land of
1560,BOOK II.,"the Eneti, whence is the breed of wild mules. This folk were they that"
1561,BOOK II.,"possessed Kytoros and dwelt about Sesamon, and inhabited their famed"
1562,BOOK II.,dwellings round the river Parthenios and Kromna and Aigialos and lofty
1563,BOOK II.,Erythini.
1564,BOOK II.,
1565,BOOK II.,"And the Alizones were led of Odios and Epistrophos, from far away in"
1566,BOOK II.,"Alybe, where is the birthplace of silver."
1567,BOOK II.,
1568,BOOK II.,"And the Mysians were led of Chromis and Ennomos the augur, yet with all"
1569,BOOK II.,"his auguries warded he not black fate from him, but was vanguished by"
1570,BOOK II.,"the hand of fleet-footed Aiakides in the river, when he made havoc of"
1571,BOOK II.,the Trojans there and of the rest.
1572,BOOK II.,
1573,BOOK II.,"And Phorkys and godlike Askanios led the Phrygians from far Askania,"
1574,BOOK II.,and these were eager to fight in the battle-throng.
1575,BOOK II.,
1576,BOOK II.,"And the Maionians were commanded of Mesthles and Antiphos, Talaimenes’"
1577,BOOK II.,"two sons, whose mother was the Gygaian mere. So these led the"
1578,BOOK II.,"Maionians, whose birthplace was under Tmolos."
1579,BOOK II.,
1580,BOOK II.,"But Nastes led the Karians, uncouth of speech, that possessed Miletos"
1581,BOOK II.,"and the mountain of Phthires, of leafage numberless, and the streams of"
1582,BOOK II.,Maiandros and the steep crest of Mykale. These were led of Amphimachos
1583,BOOK II.,and Nastes: Nastes and Amphimachos the glorious children of Nomion. And
1584,BOOK II.,"he came, forsooth, to battle with golden attire like a girl—fond man:"
1585,BOOK II.,"that held not back in any wise grievous destruction, but he was"
1586,BOOK II.,"vanguished by the hands of fleet-footed Aiakides in the river, and"
1587,BOOK II.,wise-hearted Achilles carried away his gold.
1588,BOOK II.,
1589,BOOK II.,And Sarpedon and blameless Glaukos led the Lykians from far away in
1590,BOOK II.,Lykia by eddying Xanthos.
1591,BOOK II.,
1592,BOOK II.,
1593,BOOK II.,
1594,BOOK II.,
1595,BOOK III.,BOOK III.
1596,BOOK III.,
1597,BOOK III.,
1598,BOOK III.,How Menelaos and Paris fought in single combat; and Aphrodite rescued
1599,BOOK III.,Paris. And how Helen and Priam beheld the Achaian host from the walls
1600,BOOK III.,of Troy.
1601,BOOK III.,
1602,BOOK III.,
1603,BOOK III.,"Now when they were arrayed, each company with their captains, the"
1604,BOOK III.,"Trojans marched with clamour and with shouting like unto birds, even as"
1605,BOOK III.,when there goeth up before heaven a clamour of cranes which flee from
1606,BOOK III.,"the coming of winter and sudden rain, and fly with clamour towards the"
1607,BOOK III.,"streams of ocean, bearing slaughter and fate to the Pigmy men, and in"
1608,BOOK III.,early morn offer cruel battle. But on the other side marched the
1609,BOOK III.,"Achaians in silence breathing courage, eager at heart to give succour"
1610,BOOK III.,man to man.
1611,BOOK III.,
1612,BOOK III.,Even as when the south wind sheddeth mist over the crests of a
1613,BOOK III.,"mountain, mist unwelcome to the shepherd, but to the robber better than"
1614,BOOK III.,"night, and a man can see no further than he casteth a stone; even so"
1615,BOOK III.,thick arose the gathering dust-clouds at their tread as they went; and
1616,BOOK III.,with all speed they advanced across the plain.
1617,BOOK III.,
1618,BOOK III.,"So when they were now come nigh in onset on each other, godlike"
1619,BOOK III.,"Alexandros played champion to the Trojans, wearing upon his shoulders"
1620,BOOK III.,panther-skin and curved bow and sword; and he brandished two
1621,BOOK III.,bronze-headed spears and challenged all the chieftains of the Argives
1622,BOOK III.,to fight him man to man in deadly combat. But when Menelaos dear to
1623,BOOK III.,Ares marked him coming in the forefront of the multitude with long
1624,BOOK III.,"strides, then even as a lion is glad when he lighteth upon a great"
1625,BOOK III.,"carcase, a horned stag, or a wild goat that he hath found, being an"
1626,BOOK III.,"hungered; and so he devoureth it amain, even though the fleet hounds"
1627,BOOK III.,and lusty youths set upon him; even thus was Menelaos glad when his
1628,BOOK III.,eyes beheld godlike Alexandros; for he thought to take vengeance upon
1629,BOOK III.,the sinner. So straightway he leapt in his armour from his chariot to
1630,BOOK III.,the ground.
1631,BOOK III.,
1632,BOOK III.,"But when godlike Alexandros marked him appear amid the champions, his"
1633,BOOK III.,"heart was smitten, and he shrank back into the host of his comrades,"
1634,BOOK III.,avoiding death. And even as a man that hath seen a serpent in a
1635,BOOK III.,mountain glade starteth backward and trembling seizeth his feet beneath
1636,BOOK III.,"him, and he retreateth back again, and paleness hath hold of his"
1637,BOOK III.,"cheeks, even so did godlike Alexandros for fear of Atreus’ son shrink"
1638,BOOK III.,back into the throng of lordly Trojans. But Hector beheld and upbraided
1639,BOOK III.,"him with scornful words: “Ill Paris, most fair in semblance, thou"
1640,BOOK III.,"deceiver woman-mad, would thou hadst been unborn and died unwed. Yea,"
1641,BOOK III.,"that were my desire, and it were far better than thus to be our shame"
1642,BOOK III.,and looked at askance of all men. I ween that the flowing-haired
1643,BOOK III.,"Achaians laugh, deeming that a prince is our champion only because a"
1644,BOOK III.,goodly favour is his; but in his heart is there no strength nor any
1645,BOOK III.,courage. Art thou indeed such an one that in thy seafaring ships thou
1646,BOOK III.,"didst sail over the deep with the company of thy trusty comrades, and"
1647,BOOK III.,in converse with strangers didst bring back a fair woman from a far
1648,BOOK III.,"country, one that was by marriage daughter to warriors that bear the"
1649,BOOK III.,"spear, that she might be a sore mischief to thy father and city and all"
1650,BOOK III.,"the realm, but to our foes a rejoicing, and to thyself a hanging of the"
1651,BOOK III.,head? And canst thou not indeed abide Menelaos dear to Ares? Thou
1652,BOOK III.,mightest see what sort of warrior is he whose lovely wife thou hast.
1653,BOOK III.,"Thy lyre will not avail thee nor the gifts of Aphrodite, those thy"
1654,BOOK III.,"locks and fair favour, when thou grovellest in the dust. But the"
1655,BOOK III.,Trojans are very cowards: else ere this hadst thou donned a robe of
1656,BOOK III.,stone* for all the ill thou hast wrought.”
1657,BOOK III.,
1658,BOOK III.,"* _i.e_., been stoned by the people."
1659,BOOK III.,
1660,BOOK III.,
1661,BOOK III.,"And godlike Alexandros made answer to him again: “Hector, since in"
1662,BOOK III.,"measure thou chidest me and not beyond measure—thy heart is ever keen,"
1663,BOOK III.,even as an axe that pierceth a beam at the hand of a man that shapeth a
1664,BOOK III.,"ship’s timber with skill, and thereby is the man’s blow strengthened;"
1665,BOOK III.,even such is thy heart undaunted in thy breast. Cast not in my teeth
1666,BOOK III.,the lovely gifts of golden Aphrodite; not to be flung aside are the
1667,BOOK III.,gods’ glorious gifts that of their own good will they give; for by his
1668,BOOK III.,desire can no man win them. But now if thou wilt have me do battle and
1669,BOOK III.,"fight, make the other Trojans sit down and all the Achaians, and set ye"
1670,BOOK III.,"me in the midst, and Menelaos dear to Ares, to fight for Helen and all"
1671,BOOK III.,"her wealth. And whichsoever shall vanquish and gain the upper hand, let"
1672,BOOK III.,"him take all the wealth aright, and the woman, and bear them home. And"
1673,BOOK III.,let the rest pledge friendship and sure oaths; so may ye dwell in
1674,BOOK III.,"deep-soiled Troy, and let them depart to Argos pasture-land of horses,"
1675,BOOK III.,and Achaia home of fair women.”
1676,BOOK III.,
1677,BOOK III.,"So spake he, and Hector rejoiced greatly to hear his saying, and went"
1678,BOOK III.,"into the midst and restrained the battalions of the Trojans, with his"
1679,BOOK III.,spear grasped by the middle; and they all sate them down. But the
1680,BOOK III.,"flowing-haired Achaians kept shooting at him, aiming with arrows and"
1681,BOOK III.,"casting stones. But Agamemnon king of men cried aloud: “Refrain, ye"
1682,BOOK III.,"Argives; shoot not, ye sons of the Achaians; for Hector of the glancing"
1683,BOOK III.,helm hath set himself to say somewhat.”
1684,BOOK III.,
1685,BOOK III.,"So spake he, and they refrained from battle and made silence speedily."
1686,BOOK III.,"And Hector spake between the two hosts, “Hear of me, Trojans and"
1687,BOOK III.,"well-greaved Achaians, the saying of Alexandros, for whose sake strife"
1688,BOOK III.,hath come about. He biddeth the other Trojans and all the Achaians to
1689,BOOK III.,"lay down their goodly armour on the bounteous earth, and himself in the"
1690,BOOK III.,midst and Menelaos dear to Ares to fight alone for Helen and all her
1691,BOOK III.,"wealth. And whichsoever shall vanquish and gain the upper hand, let him"
1692,BOOK III.,"take all the wealth aright, and the woman, and bear them home; but let"
1693,BOOK III.,all of us pledge friendship and sure oaths.”
1694,BOOK III.,
1695,BOOK III.,"So spake he, and they all kept silence and were still. Then in their"
1696,BOOK III.,"midst spake Menelaos of the loud war-cry: “Hearken ye now to me, too;"
1697,BOOK III.,for into my heart most of all is grief entered; and I deem that the
1698,BOOK III.,parting of Argives and Trojans hath come at last; seeing ye have
1699,BOOK III.,endured many ills because of my quarrel and the first sin of
1700,BOOK III.,"Alexandros. And for whichsoever of us death and fate are prepared, let"
1701,BOOK III.,"him lie dead: and be ye all parted with speed. Bring ye two lambs, one"
1702,BOOK III.,"white ram and one black ewe, for earth and sun; and let us bring one"
1703,BOOK III.,"for Zeus. And call hither great Priam, that he may pledge the oath"
1704,BOOK III.,"himself, seeing he hath sons that are overweening and faithless, lest"
1705,BOOK III.,any by transgression do violence to the oath of Zeus; for young men’s
1706,BOOK III.,"hearts are ever lifted up. But wheresoever an old man entereth in, he"
1707,BOOK III.,"looketh both before and after, whereby the best issue shall come for"
1708,BOOK III.,either side.”
1709,BOOK III.,
1710,BOOK III.,"So spake he, and Achaians and Trojans were glad, deeming that they"
1711,BOOK III.,should have rest from grievous war. So they refrained their chariots to
1712,BOOK III.,"the ranks, and themselves alighted and doffed their arms. And these"
1713,BOOK III.,"they laid upon the earth each close to each, and there was but small"
1714,BOOK III.,"space between. And Hector sent two heralds to the city will all speed,"
1715,BOOK III.,"to bring the lambs, and to call Priam. And lord Agamemnon sent forth"
1716,BOOK III.,"Talthybios to go to the hollow ships, and bade him bring a ram; and he"
1717,BOOK III.,was not disobedient to noble Agamemnon.
1718,BOOK III.,
1719,BOOK III.,Now Iris went with a message to white-armed Helen in the likeness of
1720,BOOK III.,"her husband’s sister, the spouse of Antenor’s son, even her that lord"
1721,BOOK III.,"Helikaon Antenor’s son had to wife, Laodike fairest favoured of Priam’s"
1722,BOOK III.,daughters. And in the hall she found Helen weaving a great purple web
1723,BOOK III.,"of double fold, and embroidering thereon many battles of horse-taming"
1724,BOOK III.,"Trojans and mail-clad Achaians, that they had endured for her sake at"
1725,BOOK III.,the hands of Ares. So fleet-footed Iris stood by her side and said:
1726,BOOK III.,"“Come hither, dear sister, that thou mayest see the wondrous doings of"
1727,BOOK III.,horse-taming Trojans and mail-clad Achaians. They that erst waged
1728,BOOK III.,"tearful war upon each other in the plain, eager for deadly battle, even"
1729,BOOK III.,"they sit now in silence, and the tall spears are planted by their"
1730,BOOK III.,sides. But Alexandros and Menelaos dear to Ares will fight with their
1731,BOOK III.,tall spears for thee; and thou wilt be declared the dear wife of him
1732,BOOK III.,that conquereth.”
1733,BOOK III.,
1734,BOOK III.,"So spake the goddess, and put into her heart sweet longing for her"
1735,BOOK III.,former husband and her city and parents.
1736,BOOK III.,
1737,BOOK III.,"Forthwith she veiled her face in shining linen, and hastened from her"
1738,BOOK III.,"chamber, letting fall a round tear; not unattended, for there followed"
1739,BOOK III.,"with her two handmaidens, Aithre daughter of Pittheus and ox-eyed"
1740,BOOK III.,Klymene. Then came she straightway to the place of the Skaian gates.
1741,BOOK III.,And they that were with Priam and Panthoos and Thymoites and Lampos and
1742,BOOK III.,"Klytios and Hiketaon of the stock of Ares, Oukalegon withal and"
1743,BOOK III.,"Antenor, twain sages, being elders of the people, sat at the Skaian"
1744,BOOK III.,"gates. These had now ceased from battle for old age, yet were they"
1745,BOOK III.,"right good orators, like grasshoppers that in a forest sit upon a tree"
1746,BOOK III.,and utter their lily-like* voice; even so sat the elders of the Trojans
1747,BOOK III.,upon the tower. Now when they saw Helen coming to the tower they softly
1748,BOOK III.,spake winged words one to the other: “Small blame is it that Trojans
1749,BOOK III.,and well-greaved Achaians should for such a woman long time suffer
1750,BOOK III.,hardships; marvellously like is she to the immortal goddesses to look
1751,BOOK III.,"upon. Yet even so, though she be so goodly, let her go upon their ships"
1752,BOOK III.,and not stay to vex us and our children after us.”
1753,BOOK III.,
1754,BOOK III.,* Supposed to mean “delicate” or “tender”.
1755,BOOK III.,
1756,BOOK III.,
1757,BOOK III.,"So said they, and Priam lifted up his voice and called to Helen: “Come"
1758,BOOK III.,"hither, dear child, and sit before me, that thou mayest see thy former"
1759,BOOK III.,husband and they kinsfolk and thy friends. I hold thee not to blame;
1760,BOOK III.,"nay, I hold the gods to blame who brought on me the dolorous war of the"
1761,BOOK III.,"Achaians—so mayest thou now tell me who is this huge hero, this Achaian"
1762,BOOK III.,warrior so goodly and great. Of a truth there are others even taller by
1763,BOOK III.,a head; yet mine eyes never behold a man so beautiful nor so royal; for
1764,BOOK III.,he is like unto one that is a king.”
1765,BOOK III.,
1766,BOOK III.,"And Helen, fair among women, spake and answered him: “Reverend art thou"
1767,BOOK III.,"to me and dread, dear father of my lord; would that sore death had been"
1768,BOOK III.,"my pleasure when I followed thy son hither, and left my home and my"
1769,BOOK III.,kinsfolk and my daughter in her girlhood and the lovely company of mine
1770,BOOK III.,"age-fellows. But that was not so, wherefore I pine with weeping. Now"
1771,BOOK III.,will I tell thee that whereof thou askest me and enquirest. This is
1772,BOOK III.,"Atreides, wide-ruling Agamemnon, one that is both a goodly king and"
1773,BOOK III.,"mighty spearman. And he was my husband’s brother to me, ah shameless"
1774,BOOK III.,me; if ever such an one there was.”
1775,BOOK III.,
1776,BOOK III.,"So said she, and the old man marvelled at him, and said: “Ah, happy"
1777,BOOK III.,"Atreides, child of fortune, blest of heaven; now know I that many sons"
1778,BOOK III.,"of the Achaians are subject to thee. Erewhile fared I to Phrygia, the"
1779,BOOK III.,"land of vines, and there saw I that the men of Phrygia, they of the"
1780,BOOK III.,"nimble steeds, were very many, even the hosts of Otreus and godlike"
1781,BOOK III.,"Mygdon, that were then encamped along the banks of Sangarios. For I too"
1782,BOOK III.,being their ally was numbered among them on the day that the Amazons
1783,BOOK III.,"came, the peers of men. Yet were not even they so many as are the"
1784,BOOK III.,glancing-eyed Achaians.”
1785,BOOK III.,
1786,BOOK III.,"And next the old man saw Odysseus, and asked: “Come now, tell me of"
1787,BOOK III.,"this man too, dear child, who is he, shorter by a head than Agamemnon"
1788,BOOK III.,"son of Atreus, but broader of shoulder and of chest to behold? His"
1789,BOOK III.,"armour lieth upon the bounteous earth, and himself like a bell-wether"
1790,BOOK III.,"rangeth the ranks of warriors. Yea, I liken him to a thick-fleeced ram"
1791,BOOK III.,ordering a great flock of ewes.”
1792,BOOK III.,
1793,BOOK III.,Then Helen sprung of Zeus made answer to him: “Now this is Laertes’
1794,BOOK III.,"son, crafty Odysseus, that was reared in the realm of Ithaka, rugged"
1795,BOOK III.,"though it be, and skilled in all the ways of wile and cunning device.”"
1796,BOOK III.,
1797,BOOK III.,"Then sage Antenor made answer to her: “Lady, verily the thing thou"
1798,BOOK III.,"sayest is true indeed, for erst came goodly Odysseus hither also on an"
1799,BOOK III.,"embassage for thee, in the company of Menelaos dear to Ares; and I gave"
1800,BOOK III.,"them entertainment and welcomed them in my halls, and learnt the aspect"
1801,BOOK III.,of both and their wise devices. Now when they mingled with the Trojans
1802,BOOK III.,"in the assembly, while all stood up Menelaos overpassed them all by the"
1803,BOOK III.,"measure of his broad shoulders; but when both sat down, Odysseus was"
1804,BOOK III.,the more stately. And when they began to weave the web of words and
1805,BOOK III.,"counsel in the face of all, then Menelaos harangued fluently, in few"
1806,BOOK III.,"words, but very clearly, seeing he was not long of speech, neither"
1807,BOOK III.,"random, though in years he was the younger. But whenever Odysseus full"
1808,BOOK III.,"of wiles rose up, he stood and looked down, with eyes fixed upon the"
1809,BOOK III.,"ground, and waved not his staff whether backwards or forwards, but held"
1810,BOOK III.,"it stiff, like to a man of no understanding; one would deem him to be"
1811,BOOK III.,"churlish, and naught but a fool. But when he uttered his great voice"
1812,BOOK III.,"from his chest, and words like unto the snowflakes of winter, then"
1813,BOOK III.,could no mortal man contend with Odysseus; then marvelled we not thus
1814,BOOK III.,to behold Odysseus’ aspect.”
1815,BOOK III.,
1816,BOOK III.,"And thirdly the old man say Aias, and asked: “Who then is this other"
1817,BOOK III.,"Achaian warrior, goodly and great, preeminent among the Archives by the"
1818,BOOK III.,measure of his head and broad shoulders?”
1819,BOOK III.,
1820,BOOK III.,"And long-robed Helen, fair among women, answered: “This is huge Aias,"
1821,BOOK III.,bulwark of the Achaians. And on the other side amid the Cretans
1822,BOOK III.,"standeth Idomeneus like a god, and about him are gathered the captains"
1823,BOOK III.,of the Cretans. Oft did Menelaos dear to Ares entertain him in our
1824,BOOK III.,house whene’er he came from Crete. And now behold I all the other
1825,BOOK III.,"glancing-eyed Achaians, whom well I could discern and tell their names;"
1826,BOOK III.,"but two captains of the host can I not see, even Kastor tamer of horses"
1827,BOOK III.,"and Polydeukes the skilful boxer, mine own brethren, whom the same"
1828,BOOK III.,mother bare. Either they came not in the company from lovely
1829,BOOK III.,"Lakedaimon; or they came hither indeed in their seafaring ships, but"
1830,BOOK III.,"now will not enter into the battle of the warriors, for fear of the"
1831,BOOK III.,many scornings and revilings that are mine.”
1832,BOOK III.,
1833,BOOK III.,So said she; but them the life-giving earth held fast there in
1834,BOOK III.,"Lakedaimon, in their dear native land."
1835,BOOK III.,
1836,BOOK III.,Meanwhile were the heralds bearing through the city the holy
1837,BOOK III.,"oath-offerings, two lambs and strong-hearted wine, the fruit of the"
1838,BOOK III.,"earth, in a goat-skin bottle. And the herald Idaios bare the shining"
1839,BOOK III.,bowl and golden cups; and came to the old man and summoned him and
1840,BOOK III.,"said: “Rise, thou son of Laomedon. The chieftains of the horse-taming"
1841,BOOK III.,"Trojans and mail-clad Achaians call on thee to go down into the plain,"
1842,BOOK III.,that ye may pledge a trusty oath. But Alexandros and Menelaos dear to
1843,BOOK III.,Ares will fight with their long spears for the lady’s sake; and let
1844,BOOK III.,lady and treasure go with him that shall conquer. And may we that are
1845,BOOK III.,"left pledge friendship and trusty oaths and dwell in deep-soiled Troy,"
1846,BOOK III.,and they shall depart to Argos pasture-land of horses and Achaia home
1847,BOOK III.,of fair women.”
1848,BOOK III.,
1849,BOOK III.,"So said he, and the old man shuddered and base his companions yoke the"
1850,BOOK III.,horses; and they with speed obeyed. Then Priam mounted and drew back
1851,BOOK III.,"the reins, and by his side Antenor mounted the splendid chariot. So the"
1852,BOOK III.,two drave the fleet horses through the Skaian gates to the plain. And
1853,BOOK III.,"when they had come even to the Trojans and Achaians, they went down"
1854,BOOK III.,"from the chariots upon the bounteous earth, and marched into the midst"
1855,BOOK III.,"of Trojans and Achaians. Then forthwith rose up Agamemnon king of men,"
1856,BOOK III.,and up rose Odysseus the man of wiles; and the lordly heralds gathered
1857,BOOK III.,"together the holy oath-offerings of the gods, and mingled the wine in a"
1858,BOOK III.,"bowl, and poured water over the princes’ hands. And Atreides put forth"
1859,BOOK III.,his hand and drew his knife that hung ever beside his sword’s great
1860,BOOK III.,"sheath, and cut the hair from off the lambs’ heads; and then the"
1861,BOOK III.,heralds portioned it among the chief of the Trojans and Achaians. Then
1862,BOOK III.,in their midst Atreus’ son lifted up his hands and prayed aloud:
1863,BOOK III.,"“Father Zeus, that rulest from Ida, most glorious, most great, and thou"
1864,BOOK III.,"Sun that seest all things and hearest all things, and ye Rivers and"
1865,BOOK III.,"thou Earth, and ye that in the underworld punish men outworn, whosoever"
1866,BOOK III.,"sweareth falsely; be ye witnesses, and watch over the faithful oath. If"
1867,BOOK III.,"Alexandros slay Menelaos, then let him have Helen to himself and all"
1868,BOOK III.,her possessions; and we will depart on our seafaring ships. But if
1869,BOOK III.,"golden-haired Menelaos slay Alexandros, then let the Trojans give back"
1870,BOOK III.,Helen and all her possessions and pay the Argives the recompense that
1871,BOOK III.,"is seemly, such as shall live among men that shall be hereafter. But if"
1872,BOOK III.,so be that Priam and Priam’s sons will not pay the recompense unto me
1873,BOOK III.,"when Alexandros falleth, then will I fight on thereafter for the price"
1874,BOOK III.,"of sin, and abide here till I compass the end of war.”"
1875,BOOK III.,
1876,BOOK III.,"So said he, and cut the lambs’ throats with the pitiless knife. Them he"
1877,BOOK III.,"laid gasping upon the ground, failing of breath, for the knife had"
1878,BOOK III.,taken their strength from them; and next they drew the wine from the
1879,BOOK III.,"bowl into the cups, and poured it forth and prayed to the gods that"
1880,BOOK III.,live for ever. And thus would say many an one of Achaians and Trojans:
1881,BOOK III.,"“Zeus most glorious, most great, and all ye immortal gods, which folk"
1882,BOOK III.,"soe’er be first to sin against the oaths, may their brains be so poured"
1883,BOOK III.,"forth upon the earth even as this wine, theirs and their children’s;"
1884,BOOK III.,and let their wives be made subject unto strangers.”
1885,BOOK III.,
1886,BOOK III.,"So spake they, but the son of Kronos vouchsafed not yet fulfilment. And"
1887,BOOK III.,in their midst Priam of the seed of Dardanos uttered his saying:
1888,BOOK III.,"“Hearken to me, Trojans and well-greaved Achaians. I verily will return"
1889,BOOK III.,"back to windy Ilios, seeing that I can in no wise bear to behold with"
1890,BOOK III.,mine eyes my dear son fighting with Menelaos dear to Ares. But Zeus
1891,BOOK III.,"knoweth, and all the immortal gods, for whether of the twain the doom"
1892,BOOK III.,of death is appointed.”
1893,BOOK III.,
1894,BOOK III.,"So spake the godlike man, and laid the lambs in his chariot, and"
1895,BOOK III.,"entered in himself, and drew back the reins; and by his side Antenor"
1896,BOOK III.,mounted the splendid chariot. So they departed back again to Ilios; and
1897,BOOK III.,"Hector son of Priam and goodly Odysseus first meted out a space, and"
1898,BOOK III.,"then they took the lots, and shook them in a bronze-bound helmet, to"
1899,BOOK III.,know whether of the twain should first cast his spear of bronze. And
1900,BOOK III.,the people prayed and lifted up their hands to the gods; and thus would
1901,BOOK III.,"say many an one of Achaians and Trojans: “Father Zeus, that rulest from"
1902,BOOK III.,"Ida, most glorious, most great; whichsoe’er it be that brought this"
1903,BOOK III.,"trouble upon both peoples, vouchsafe that he may die and enter the"
1904,BOOK III.,house of Hades; that so for us peace may be assured and trusty oaths.”
1905,BOOK III.,
1906,BOOK III.,"So said they; and great Hector of the glancing plume shook the helmet,"
1907,BOOK III.,looking behind him; and quickly leapt forth the lot of Paris. Then the
1908,BOOK III.,people sat them down by ranks where each man’s high-stepping horses and
1909,BOOK III.,inwrought armour lay. And upon his shoulders goodly Alexandros donned
1910,BOOK III.,"his beauteous armour, even he that was lord to Helen of the lovely"
1911,BOOK III.,"hair. First upon his legs set he his greaves, beautiful, fastened with"
1912,BOOK III.,silver ankle-clasps; next upon his breast he donned the corslet of his
1913,BOOK III.,"brother Lykaon, and fitted it upon himself. And over his shoulders cast"
1914,BOOK III.,"he his silver-studded sword of bronze, and then a shield great and"
1915,BOOK III.,sturdy. And on his mighty head he set a wrought helmet of horse-hair
1916,BOOK III.,"crest, whereover the plume nodded terribly, and he took him a strong"
1917,BOOK III.,spear fitted to his grasp. And in like wise warlike Menelaos donned his
1918,BOOK III.,armour.
1919,BOOK III.,
1920,BOOK III.,"So when they had armed themselves on either side in the throng, they"
1921,BOOK III.,"strode between Trojans and Achaians, fierce of aspect, and wonder came"
1922,BOOK III.,"on them that beheld, both on the Trojans tamers of horses and on the"
1923,BOOK III.,well-greaved Achaians. Then took they their stand near together in the
1924,BOOK III.,"measured space, brandishing their spears in wrath each against other."
1925,BOOK III.,"First Alexandros hurled his far shadowing spear, and smote on Atreides’"
1926,BOOK III.,"round shield; but the bronze brake not through, for its point was"
1927,BOOK III.,turned in the stout shield. Next Menelaos son of Atreus lifted up his
1928,BOOK III.,"hand to cast, and made prayer to father Zeus: “King Zeus, grant me"
1929,BOOK III.,"revenge on him that was first to do me wrong, even on goodly"
1930,BOOK III.,"Alexandros, and subdue thou him at my hands; so that many an one of men"
1931,BOOK III.,that shall be hereafter may shudder to wrong his host that hath shown
1932,BOOK III.,him kindness.”
1933,BOOK III.,
1934,BOOK III.,"So said he, and poised his far-shadowing spear, and hurled, and smote"
1935,BOOK III.,on the round shield of the son of Priam. Through the bright shield went
1936,BOOK III.,the ponderous spear and through the inwrought breastplate it pressed
1937,BOOK III.,"on; and straight beside his flank the spear rent the tunic, but he"
1938,BOOK III.,swerved and escaped black death. Then Atreides drew his silver-studded
1939,BOOK III.,"sword, and lifted up his hand and smote the helmet-ridge; but the sword"
1940,BOOK III.,"shattered upon it into three, yea four, and fell from his hand. Thereat"
1941,BOOK III.,"Atreides looked up to the wide heaven and cried: “Father Zeus, surely"
1942,BOOK III.,none of the gods is crueller than thou. Verily I thought to have gotten
1943,BOOK III.,"vengeance on Alexandros for his wickedness, but now my sword breaketh"
1944,BOOK III.,"in my hand, and my spear sped from my grasp in vain, and I have not"
1945,BOOK III.,smitten him.”
1946,BOOK III.,
1947,BOOK III.,"So saying, he leapt upon him and caught him by his horse-hair crest,"
1948,BOOK III.,and swinging him round dragged him towards the well-greaved Achaians;
1949,BOOK III.,"and he was strangled by the embroidered strap beneath his soft throat,"
1950,BOOK III.,drawn tight below his chin to hold his helm. Now would Menelaos have
1951,BOOK III.,"dragged him away and won glory unspeakable, but that Zeus’ daughter"
1952,BOOK III.,"Aphrodite was swift to mark, and tore asunder for him the strap of"
1953,BOOK III.,slaughtered ox’s hide; so the helmet came away empty in his stalwart
1954,BOOK III.,hand. Thereat Menelaos cast it with a swing toward the well-greaved
1955,BOOK III.,"Achaians, and his trusty comrades took it up; and himself sprang back"
1956,BOOK III.,again eager to slay him with spear of bronze. But Aphrodite snatched up
1957,BOOK III.,"Paris, very easily as a goddess may, and hid him in thick darkness, and"
1958,BOOK III.,sent him down in his fragrant perfumed chamber; and herself went to
1959,BOOK III.,"summon Helen. Her she found on the high tower, and about her the Trojan"
1960,BOOK III.,women thronged. So with her hand she plucked her perfumed raiment and
1961,BOOK III.,"shook it and spake to her in the likeness of an aged dame, a woolcomber"
1962,BOOK III.,"that was wont to work for her fair wool when she dwelt in Lakedaimon,"
1963,BOOK III.,whom too she greatly loved. Even in her likeness fair Aphrodite spake:
1964,BOOK III.,“Come hither; Alexandros summoneth thee to go homeward. There is he in
1965,BOOK III.,"his chamber and inlaid bed, radiant in beauty and vesture; nor wouldst"
1966,BOOK III.,"thou deem him to be come from fighting his foe, but rather to be faring"
1967,BOOK III.,"to the dance, or from the dance to be just resting and set down.”"
1968,BOOK III.,
1969,BOOK III.,"So said she, and stirred Helen’s soul within her breast; and when now"
1970,BOOK III.,she marked the fair neck and lovely breast and sparkling eyes of the
1971,BOOK III.,"goddess, she marvelled straightway and spake a word and called upon her"
1972,BOOK III.,"name: “Strange queen, why art thou desirous now to beguile me? Verily"
1973,BOOK III.,thou wilt lead me further on to some one of the people cities of
1974,BOOK III.,"Phrygia or lovely Maionia, if there too thou hast perchance some other"
1975,BOOK III.,"darling among mortal men, because even now Menelaos hath conquered"
1976,BOOK III.,"goodly Alexandros, and will lead me, accursed me, to his home."
1977,BOOK III.,Therefore thou comest hither with guileful intent. Go and sit thou by
1978,BOOK III.,"his side, and depart from the way of the gods; neither let thy feet"
1979,BOOK III.,"ever bear thee back to Olympus, but still be vexed for his sake and"
1980,BOOK III.,guard him till he make thee his wife or perchance his slave. But
1981,BOOK III.,thither will I not go— that were a sinful thing—to array the bed of
1982,BOOK III.,him; all the women of Troy will blame me hereafter; and I have griefs
1983,BOOK III.,untold within my soul.”
1984,BOOK III.,
1985,BOOK III.,"Then in wrath bright Aphrodite spake to her: “Provoke me not, rash"
1986,BOOK III.,"woman, lest in mine anger I desert thee, and hate thee even as now I"
1987,BOOK III.,"love thee beyond measure, and lest I devise grievous enmities between"
1988,BOOK III.,"both, even betwixt Trojans and Achaians, and so thou perish in evil"
1989,BOOK III.,wise.”
1990,BOOK III.,
1991,BOOK III.,"So said she, and Helen sprung of Zeus was afraid, and went wrapped in"
1992,BOOK III.,"her bright radiant vesture, silently, and the Trojan women marked her"
1993,BOOK III.,not; and the goddess led the way.
1994,BOOK III.,
1995,BOOK III.,Now when they were come to the beautiful house of Alexandros the
1996,BOOK III.,"handmaidens turned straightway to their tasks, and the fair lady went"
1997,BOOK III.,to the high-roofed chamber; and laughter-loving Aphrodite took for her
1998,BOOK III.,"a chair and brought it, even she the goddess, and set it before the"
1999,BOOK III.,"face of Paris. There Helen took her seat, the child of aegis-bearing"
2000,BOOK III.,"Zeus, and with eyes turned askance spake and chode her lord: “Thou"
2001,BOOK III.,"comest back from battle; would thou hadst perished there, vanquished of"
2002,BOOK III.,that great warrior that was my former husband. Verily it was once thy
2003,BOOK III.,"boast that thou wast a better man than Menelaos dear to Ares, in the"
2004,BOOK III.,"might of thine arm and thy spear. But go now, challenge Menelaos, dear"
2005,BOOK III.,"to Ares to fight thee again face to face. Nay, but I, even I, bid thee"
2006,BOOK III.,"refrain, nor fight a fight with golden-haired Menelaos man to man,"
2007,BOOK III.,"neither attack him recklessly, lest perchance thou fall to his spear"
2008,BOOK III.,anon.”
2009,BOOK III.,
2010,BOOK III.,"And Paris made answer to her and said: “Chide not my soul, lady, with"
2011,BOOK III.,cruel taunts. For now indeed hath Menelaos vanquished me with Athene’s
2012,BOOK III.,"aid, but another day may I do so unto him; for we too have gods with"
2013,BOOK III.,"us. But come now, let us have joy of love upon our couch; for never yet"
2014,BOOK III.,hath love so enwrapped my heart—not even then when first I snatched
2015,BOOK III.,"thee from lovely Lakedaimon and sailed with thee on my seafaring ships,"
2016,BOOK III.,and in the isle of Kranaë had converse with thee upon thy couch in
2017,BOOK III.,love—as I love thee now and sweet desire taketh hold upon me.” So
2018,BOOK III.,"saying he led the way to the couch, and the lady followed with him."
2019,BOOK III.,
2020,BOOK III.,Thus laid they them upon their fretted couch; but Atreides the while
2021,BOOK III.,"strode through the host like to a wild beast, if anywhere he might set"
2022,BOOK III.,eyes on godlike Alexandros. But none of the Trojans or their famed
2023,BOOK III.,allies could discover Alexandros to Menelaos dear to Ares. Yet surely
2024,BOOK III.,"did they in no wise hide him for kindliness, could any have seen him;"
2025,BOOK III.,for he was hated of all even as black death. So Agamemnon king of men
2026,BOOK III.,"spake among them there: “Hearken to me, Trojans and Dardanians and"
2027,BOOK III.,allies. Now is victory declared for Menelaos dear to Ares; give ye back
2028,BOOK III.,"Helen of Argos and the possessions with her, and pay ye the recompense"
2029,BOOK III.,"such as is seemly, that it may live even among men that shall be"
2030,BOOK III.,"hereafter.” So said Atreides, and all the Achaians gave assent."
2031,BOOK III.,

2034,BOOK III.,
2035,BOOK IV.,BOOK IV.
2036,BOOK IV.,
2037,BOOK IV.,
2038,BOOK IV.,How Pandaros wounded Menelaos by treachery; and Agamemnon exhorted his
2039,BOOK IV.,chief captains to battle.
2040,BOOK IV.,
2041,BOOK IV.,
2042,BOOK IV.,"Now the gods sat by Zeus and held assembly on the golden floor, and in"
2043,BOOK IV.,the midst the lady Hebe poured them their nectar: they with golden
2044,BOOK IV.,"goblets pledged one another, and gazed upon the city of the Trojans."
2045,BOOK IV.,"Then did Kronos’ son essay to provoke Hera with vexing words, and spake"
2046,BOOK IV.,"maliciously: “Twain goddesses hath Menelaos for his helpers, even Hera"
2047,BOOK IV.,of Argos and Alalkomenean Athene. Yet these sit apart and take their
2048,BOOK IV.,pleasure in beholding; but beside that other ever standeth
2049,BOOK IV.,"laughter-loving Aphrodite and wardeth off fate from him, and now hath"
2050,BOOK IV.,she saved him as he thought to perish. But of a truth the victory is to
2051,BOOK IV.,Menelaos dear to Ares; so let us take thought how these things shall
2052,BOOK IV.,"be; whether once more we shall arouse ill war and the dread battle-din,"
2053,BOOK IV.,or put friendship between the foes. Moreover if this were welcome to
2054,BOOK IV.,"all and well pleasing, may the city of king Priam yet be an habitation,"
2055,BOOK IV.,and Menelaos take back Helen of Argos.”
2056,BOOK IV.,
2057,BOOK IV.,"So said he, but Athene and Hera murmured thereat, who were sitting by"
2058,BOOK IV.,him and devising ills for the Trojans. Now Athene held her peace and
2059,BOOK IV.,"said not anything, for wrath at father Zeus, and fierce anger gat hold"
2060,BOOK IV.,"upon her: But Hera’s breast contained not her anger, and she spake:"
2061,BOOK IV.,"“Most dread son of Kronos, what word is this thou hast spoken? How hast"
2062,BOOK IV.,"thou the will to make my labour void and of none effect, and the sweat"
2063,BOOK IV.,"of my toil that I sweated, when my horses were wearied with my"
2064,BOOK IV.,"summoning of the host, to be the plague of Priam and his sons? Do as"
2065,BOOK IV.,thou wilt; but we other gods do not all approve thee.”
2066,BOOK IV.,
2067,BOOK IV.,"Then in sore anger Zeus the cloud-gatherer spake to her: “Good lack,"
2068,BOOK IV.,how have Priam and Priam’s sons done thee such great wrong that thou
2069,BOOK IV.,art furiously minded to sack the stablished citadel of Ilios? Perchance
2070,BOOK IV.,wert thou to enter within the gates and long walls and devour Priam
2071,BOOK IV.,"raw, and Priam’s sons and all the Trojans, then mightest thou assuage"
2072,BOOK IV.,"thine anger. Do as thou art minded, only let not this quarrel hereafter"
2073,BOOK IV.,be to me and thee a sore strife between us both. And this moreover will
2074,BOOK IV.,"I say to thee, and do thou lay it to thy heart; whene’er I too be of"
2075,BOOK IV.,eager mind to lay waste a city where is the race of men that are dear
2076,BOOK IV.,"to thee, hinder thou not my wrath, but let me be, even as I yield to"
2077,BOOK IV.,"thee of free will, yet with soul unwilling. For of all cities beneath"
2078,BOOK IV.,"sun and starry heaven that are the dwelling of mortal men, holy Ilios"
2079,BOOK IV.,"was most honoured of my heart, and Priam and the folk of Priam of the"
2080,BOOK IV.,"good ashen spear. For never did mine altar lack the seemly feast, even"
2081,BOOK IV.,"drink-offering and burnt-offering, the worship that is our due.”"
2082,BOOK IV.,
2083,BOOK IV.,Then Helen the ox-eyed queen made answer to him: “Of a surety three
2084,BOOK IV.,"cities are there that be dearest far to me, Argos and Sparta and"
2085,BOOK IV.,wide-wayed Mykene; these lay thou waste whene’er they are found hateful
2086,BOOK IV.,"to thy heart; not for them will I stand forth, nor do I grudge thee"
2087,BOOK IV.,"them. For even if I be jealous and would forbid thee to overthrow them,"
2088,BOOK IV.,"yet will my jealousy not avail, seeing that thou art stronger far than"
2089,BOOK IV.,I. Still must my labour too not be made of none effect; for I also am a
2090,BOOK IV.,"god, and my lineage is even as thine, and Kronos the crooked counsellor"
2091,BOOK IV.,"begat me to the place of honour in double wise, by birthright, and"
2092,BOOK IV.,"because I am named thy spouse, and thou art king among all the"
2093,BOOK IV.,"immortals. Let us indeed yield each to other herein, I to thee and thou"
2094,BOOK IV.,"to me, and the rest of the immortal gods will follow with us; and do"
2095,BOOK IV.,thou with speed charge Athene to betake her to the fierce battle din of
2096,BOOK IV.,"Trojans and Achaians, and to essay that the Trojans may first take upon"
2097,BOOK IV.,"them to do violence to the Achaians in their triumph, despite the"
2098,BOOK IV.,oaths.”
2099,BOOK IV.,
2100,BOOK IV.,"So said she, and the father of men and gods disregarded not; forthwith"
2101,BOOK IV.,he spake to Athene winged words: “Betake thee with all speed to the
2102,BOOK IV.,"host, to the midst of Trojans and Achaians, and essay that the Trojans"
2103,BOOK IV.,may first take upon them to do violence to the Achaians in their
2104,BOOK IV.,"triumph, despite the oaths.”"
2105,BOOK IV.,
2106,BOOK IV.,"So spake he, and roused Athene that already was set thereon; and from"
2107,BOOK IV.,Olympus’ heights she darted down. Even as the son of Kronos the crooked
2108,BOOK IV.,"counsellor sendeth a star, a portent for mariners or a wide host of"
2109,BOOK IV.,"men, bright shining, and therefrom are scattered sparks in multitude;"
2110,BOOK IV.,"even in such guise sped Pallas Athene to earth, and leapt into their"
2111,BOOK IV.,"midst; and astonishment came on them that beheld, on horse-taming"
2112,BOOK IV.,"Trojans and well-greaved Achaians. And thus would many an one say,"
2113,BOOK IV.,looking at his neighbor: “Of a surety either shall sore war and the
2114,BOOK IV.,fierce battle din return again; or else Zeus doth stablish peace
2115,BOOK IV.,"between the foes, even he that is men’s dispenser of battle.”"
2116,BOOK IV.,
2117,BOOK IV.,Thus would many an one of Achaians and Trojans say. Then the goddess
2118,BOOK IV.,"entered the throng of Trojans in the likeness of a man, even Antenor’s"
2119,BOOK IV.,"son Laodokos, a stalwart warrior, and sought for godlike Pandaros, if"
2120,BOOK IV.,"haply she might find him. Lykaon’s son found she, the noble and"
2121,BOOK IV.,"stalwart, standing, and about him the stalwart ranks of the"
2122,BOOK IV.,shield-bearing host that followed him from the streams of Aisepos. So
2123,BOOK IV.,"she came near and spake winged words: “Wilt thou now hearken to me,"
2124,BOOK IV.,thou wise son of Lykaon? Then wouldst thou take heart to shoot a swift
2125,BOOK IV.,"arrow at Menelaos, and wouldst win favour and glory before all the"
2126,BOOK IV.,"Trojans, and before king Alexandros most of all. Surely from him first"
2127,BOOK IV.,"of any wouldst thou receive glorious gifts, if perchance he see"
2128,BOOK IV.,"Menelaos, Atreus’ warrior son, vanquished by thy dart and brought to"
2129,BOOK IV.,"the grievous pyre. Go to now, shoot at glorious Menelaos, and vow to"
2130,BOOK IV.,"Apollo, the son of light,* the lord of archery, to sacrifice a goodly"
2131,BOOK IV.,"hecatomb of firstling lambs when thou art returned to thy home, in the"
2132,BOOK IV.,city of holy Zeleia.”
2133,BOOK IV.,
2134,BOOK IV.,"* Or, perhaps, “the Wolf-born.”"
2135,BOOK IV.,
2136,BOOK IV.,
2137,BOOK IV.,"So spake Athene, and persuaded his fool’s heart. Forthwith he"
2138,BOOK IV.,unsheathed his polished bow of horn of a wild ibex that he himself had
2139,BOOK IV.,"erst smitten beneath the breast as it came forth from a rock, the while"
2140,BOOK IV.,"he awaited in a lurking-place; and had pierced it in the chest, so that"
2141,BOOK IV.,it fell backward on the rock. Now from its head sprang there horns of
2142,BOOK IV.,"sixteen palms; these the artificer, even the worker in horn, joined"
2143,BOOK IV.,"cunningly together, and polished them all well and set the top of gold"
2144,BOOK IV.,"thereon. So he laid it down when he had well strung it, by resting it"
2145,BOOK IV.,upon the ground; and his staunch comrades held their shields before
2146,BOOK IV.,"him, lest the warrior sons of the Achaians should first set on them,"
2147,BOOK IV.,"ere Menelaos, Atreus’ warrior son, were smitten. Then opened he the lid"
2148,BOOK IV.,"of his quiver and took forth a feathered arrow, never yet shot, a"
2149,BOOK IV.,source of grievous pangs; and anon he laid the bitter dart upon the
2150,BOOK IV.,"string and vowed to Apollo, the son of light, the lord of archery, to"
2151,BOOK IV.,sacrifice a goodly hecatomb of firstling lambs when he should have
2152,BOOK IV.,returned to his home in the city of holy Zeleia. Then he took the notch
2153,BOOK IV.,"and string of oxes’ sinew together, and drew, bringing to his breast"
2154,BOOK IV.,"the string, and to the bow the iron head. So when he had now bent the"
2155,BOOK IV.,"great bow into a round, the horn twanged, and the string sang aloud,"
2156,BOOK IV.,and the keen arrow leapt eager to wing his way amid the throng.
2157,BOOK IV.,
2158,BOOK IV.,"But the blessed gods immortal forgat not thee, Menelaos; and before all"
2159,BOOK IV.,"the daughter of Zeus, the driver of the spoil, who stood before thee"
2160,BOOK IV.,and warded off the piercing dart. She turned it just aside from the
2161,BOOK IV.,"flesh, even as a mother driveth a fly from her child that lieth in"
2162,BOOK IV.,sweet slumber; and with her own hand guided it where the golden buckles
2163,BOOK IV.,of the belt were clasped and the doubled breastplate met them. So the
2164,BOOK IV.,bitter arrow lighted upon the firm belt; through the inwrought belt it
2165,BOOK IV.,sped and through the curiously wrought breastplate it pressed on and
2166,BOOK IV.,"through the taslet* he wore to shield his flesh, a barrier against"
2167,BOOK IV.,"darts; and this best shielded him, yet it passed on even through this."
2168,BOOK IV.,"Then did the arrow graze the warrior’s outermost flesh, and forthwith"
2169,BOOK IV.,the dusky blood flowed from the wound.
2170,BOOK IV.,
2171,BOOK IV.,"* An apron or belt set with metal, worn below the corslet."
2172,BOOK IV.,
2173,BOOK IV.,
2174,BOOK IV.,"As when some woman of Maionia or Karia staineth ivory with purple, to"
2175,BOOK IV.,"make a cheek-piece for horses, and it is laid up in the treasure"
2176,BOOK IV.,"chamber, and many a horseman prayeth for it to wear; but it is laid up"
2177,BOOK IV.,"to be a king’s boast, alike an adornment for his horse and a glory for"
2178,BOOK IV.,"his charioteer; even in such wise, Menelaos, were thy shapely thighs"
2179,BOOK IV.,stained with blood and thy legs and thy fair ankles beneath.
2180,BOOK IV.,
2181,BOOK IV.,Thereat shuddered Agamemnon king of men when he saw the black blood
2182,BOOK IV.,flowing from the wound. And Menelaos dear to Ares likewise shuddered;
2183,BOOK IV.,"but when he saw how thread* and barbs were without, his spirit was"
2184,BOOK IV.,"gathered in his breast again. Then lord Agamemnon moaned deep, and"
2185,BOOK IV.,"spake among them, holding Menelaos by the hand; and his comrades made"
2186,BOOK IV.,"moan the while: “Dear brother, to thy death, meseemeth, pledged I these"
2187,BOOK IV.,"oaths, setting thee forth to fight the Trojans alone before the face of"
2188,BOOK IV.,"the Achaians; seeing that the Trojans have so smitten thee, and trodden"
2189,BOOK IV.,"under foot the trusty oaths. Yet in no wise is an oath of none effect,"
2190,BOOK IV.,and the blood of lambs and pure drink-offerings and the right hands of
2191,BOOK IV.,fellowship wherein we trusted. For even if the Olympian bring not about
2192,BOOK IV.,"the fulfilment forthwith, yet doth he fulfil at last, and men make dear"
2193,BOOK IV.,"amends, even with their own heads and their wives and little ones. Yea"
2194,BOOK IV.,of a surety I know this in heart and soul; the day shall come for holy
2195,BOOK IV.,"Ilios to be laid low, and Priam and the folk of Priam of the good ashen"
2196,BOOK IV.,"spear; and Zeus the son of Kronos enthroned on high, that dwelleth in"
2197,BOOK IV.,"the heaven, himself shall brandish over them all his lowring aegis, in"
2198,BOOK IV.,indignation at this deceit. Then shall all this not be void; yet shall
2199,BOOK IV.,"I have sore sorrow for thee, Menelaos, if thou die and fulfil the lot"
2200,BOOK IV.,"of life. Yea in utter shame should I return to thirsty Argos, seeing"
2201,BOOK IV.,"that the Achaians will forthwith bethink them of their native land, and"
2202,BOOK IV.,"so should we leave to Priam and the Trojans their boast, even Helen of"
2203,BOOK IV.,Argos. And the earth shall rot thy bones as thou liest in Troy with thy
2204,BOOK IV.,task unfinished: and thus shall many an overweening Trojan say as he
2205,BOOK IV.,leapeth upon the tomb of glorious Menelaos: ‘Would to God Agamemnon
2206,BOOK IV.,"might so fulfil his wrath in every matter, even as now he led hither"
2207,BOOK IV.,"the host of the Achaians for naught, and hath gone home again to his"
2208,BOOK IV.,"dear native land with empty ships, and hath left noble Menelaos"
2209,BOOK IV.,behind.’ Thus shall men say hereafter: in that day let the wide earth
2210,BOOK IV.,gape for me.”
2211,BOOK IV.,
2212,BOOK IV.,* By which the iron head was attached to the shaft.
2213,BOOK IV.,
2214,BOOK IV.,
2215,BOOK IV.,But golden-haired Menelaos encouraged him and said: “Be of good
2216,BOOK IV.,"courage, neither dismay at all the host of the Achaians. The keen dart"
2217,BOOK IV.,"lighted not upon a deadly spot; my glistening belt in front stayed it,"
2218,BOOK IV.,"and the kirtle of mail beneath, and the taslet that the coppersmiths"
2219,BOOK IV.,fashioned.”
2220,BOOK IV.,
2221,BOOK IV.,"Then lord Agamemnon answered him and said: “Would it may be so, dear"
2222,BOOK IV.,"Menelaos. But the leech shall feel the wound, and lay thereon drugs"
2223,BOOK IV.,that shall assuage thy dire pangs.”
2224,BOOK IV.,
2225,BOOK IV.,"So saying he spake to godlike Talthybios, his herald: “Talthybios, with"
2226,BOOK IV.,"all speed call Machaon hither, the hero son of Asklepios the noble"
2227,BOOK IV.,"leech, to see Menelaos, Atreus’ warrior son, whom one well skilled in"
2228,BOOK IV.,"archery, some Trojan or Lykian, hath wounded with a bow-shot, to his"
2229,BOOK IV.,glory and our grief.”
2230,BOOK IV.,
2231,BOOK IV.,"So said he, and the herald heard him and disregarded not, and went his"
2232,BOOK IV.,way through the host of mail-clad Achaians to spy out the hero Machaon.
2233,BOOK IV.,"Him he found standing, and about him the stalwart ranks of the"
2234,BOOK IV.,"shield-bearing host that followed him from Trike, pasture land of"
2235,BOOK IV.,"horses. So he came near and spake his winged words: “Arise, thou son of"
2236,BOOK IV.,"Asklepios. Lord Agamemnon calleth thee to see Menelaos, captain of the"
2237,BOOK IV.,"Achaians, whom one well skilled in archery, some Trojan or Lykian, hath"
2238,BOOK IV.,"wounded with a bow-shot, to his glory and our grief.”"
2239,BOOK IV.,
2240,BOOK IV.,"So saying he aroused his spirit in his breast, and they went their way"
2241,BOOK IV.,"amid the throng, through the wide host of the Achaians. And when they"
2242,BOOK IV.,"were now come where was golden-haired Menelaos wounded, and all as many"
2243,BOOK IV.,"as were chieftains gathered around him in a circle, the godlike hero"
2244,BOOK IV.,"came and stood in their midst, and anon drew forth the arrow from the"
2245,BOOK IV.,clasped belt; and as it was drawn forth the keen barbs were broken
2246,BOOK IV.,backwards. Then he loosed the glistering belt and kirtle of mail
2247,BOOK IV.,beneath and taslet that the coppersmiths fashioned; and when he saw the
2248,BOOK IV.,"wound where the bitter arrow had lighted, he sucked out the blood and"
2249,BOOK IV.,"cunningly spread thereon soothing drugs, such as Cheiron of his good"
2250,BOOK IV.,will had imparted to his sire.
2251,BOOK IV.,
2252,BOOK IV.,"While these were tending Menelaos of the loud war-cry, the ranks of"
2253,BOOK IV.,shield-bearing Trojans came on; so the Achaians donned their arms
2254,BOOK IV.,"again, and bethought them of the fray. Now wouldest thou not see noble"
2255,BOOK IV.,"Agamemnon slumbering, nor cowering, nor unready to fight, but very"
2256,BOOK IV.,eager for glorious battle. He left his horses and his chariot adorned
2257,BOOK IV.,"with bronze; and his squire, even Eurymedon son of Ptolemaios"
2258,BOOK IV.,"Peiraieus’ son, kept apart the snorting steeds; and he straitly charged"
2259,BOOK IV.,him to have them at hand whenever weariness should come upon his limbs
2260,BOOK IV.,with marshalling so many; and thus on foot ranged he through the ranks
2261,BOOK IV.,of warriors. And whomsoever of all the fleet-horsed Danaans he found
2262,BOOK IV.,"eager, he stood by them and by his words encouraged them: “Ye Argives,"
2263,BOOK IV.,relax not in any wise your impetuous valour; for father Zeus will be no
2264,BOOK IV.,"helper of liars, but as these were first to transgress against the"
2265,BOOK IV.,"oaths, so shall their own tender flesh be eaten of the vultures, and we"
2266,BOOK IV.,"shall bear away their dear wives and little children in our ships, when"
2267,BOOK IV.,once we take the stronghold.”
2268,BOOK IV.,
2269,BOOK IV.,"But whomsoever he found shrinking from hateful battle, these he chode"
2270,BOOK IV.,"sore with angry words: “Ye Argives, warriors of the bow, ye men of"
2271,BOOK IV.,"dishonour, have ye no shame? Why stand ye thus dazed like fawns that"
2272,BOOK IV.,"are weary with running over the long plain and so stand still, and no"
2273,BOOK IV.,"valour is found in their hearts at all? Even thus stand ye dazed, and"
2274,BOOK IV.,fight not. Is it that ye wait for the Trojans to come near where your
2275,BOOK IV.,"good ships’ sterns are drawn up on the shore of the grey sea, to see if"
2276,BOOK IV.,Kronion will stretch his arm over you indeed?”
2277,BOOK IV.,
2278,BOOK IV.,So masterfully ranged he through the ranks of warriors. Then came he to
2279,BOOK IV.,the Cretans as he went through the throng of warriors; and these were
2280,BOOK IV.,"taking arms around wise Idomeneus; Idomeneus amid the foremost, valiant"
2281,BOOK IV.,"as a wild boar, and Meriones the while was hastening his hindermost"
2282,BOOK IV.,"battalions. Then Agamemnon king of men rejoiced to see them, and anon"
2283,BOOK IV.,"spake to Idomeneus with kindly words: “Idomeneus, more than all the"
2284,BOOK IV.,"fleet-horsed Danaans do I honour thee, whether in war or in task of"
2285,BOOK IV.,"other sort or in the feast, when the chieftains of the Argives mingle"
2286,BOOK IV.,in the bowl the gleaming wine of the counsellor. For even though all
2287,BOOK IV.,"the other flowing-haired Achaians drink one allotted portion, yet thy"
2288,BOOK IV.,"cup standeth ever full even as mine, to drink as oft as they soul"
2289,BOOK IV.,biddeth thee. Now arouse thee to war like such an one as thou avowest
2290,BOOK IV.,thyself to be of old.”
2291,BOOK IV.,
2292,BOOK IV.,"And Idomeneus the captain of the Cretans made answer to him: “Atreides,"
2293,BOOK IV.,of very truth will I be to thee a trusty comrade even as at the first I
2294,BOOK IV.,promised and gave my pledge; but do thou urge on all the flowing-haired
2295,BOOK IV.,"Achaians, that we may fight will all speed, seeing the Trojans have"
2296,BOOK IV.,disannulled the oaths. But for all that death and sorrow hereafter
2297,BOOK IV.,"shall be their lot, because they were the first to transgress against"
2298,BOOK IV.,the oaths.”
2299,BOOK IV.,
2300,BOOK IV.,"So said he, and Agamemnon passed on glad at heart. Then came he to the"
2301,BOOK IV.,Aiantes as he went through the throng of warriors; and these twain were
2302,BOOK IV.,"arming, and a cloud of footmen followed with them. Even as when a"
2303,BOOK IV.,goatherd from a place of outlook seeth a cloud coming across the deep
2304,BOOK IV.,before the blast of the west wind; and to him being afar it seemeth
2305,BOOK IV.,"ever blacker, even as pitch, as it goeth along the deep, and bringeth a"
2306,BOOK IV.,"great whirlwind, and he shuddereth to see it and driveth his flock"
2307,BOOK IV.,beneath a cave; even in such wise moved the serried battalions of young
2308,BOOK IV.,"men, the fosterlings of Zeus, by the side of the Aiantes into furious"
2309,BOOK IV.,"war, battalions dark of line, bristling with shields and spears. And"
2310,BOOK IV.,"lord Agamemnon rejoiced to see them and spake to them winged words, and"
2311,BOOK IV.,"said: “Aiantes, leaders of the mail-clad Argives, to you twain, seeing"
2312,BOOK IV.,"it is not seemly to urge you, give I no charge; for of your own selves"
2313,BOOK IV.,"ye do indeed bid your folk to fight amain. Ah, father Zeus and Athene"
2314,BOOK IV.,"and Apollo, would that all had like spirit in their breasts; then would"
2315,BOOK IV.,king Priam’s city soon bow captive and wasted beneath our hands.”
2316,BOOK IV.,
2317,BOOK IV.,"So saying he left them there, and went to others. Then found he Nestor,"
2318,BOOK IV.,"the clear-voiced orator of the Pylians, arraying his comrades, and"
2319,BOOK IV.,"urging them to fight, around great Pelagon and Alastor and Chromios and"
2320,BOOK IV.,lord Haimon and Bias shepherd of the host. And first he arrayed the
2321,BOOK IV.,"horsemen with horses and chariots, and behind them the footmen many and"
2322,BOOK IV.,"brave, to be a bulwark of battle; but the cowards he drave into the"
2323,BOOK IV.,"midst, that every man, even though he would not, yet of necessity must"
2324,BOOK IV.,fight. First he laid charge upon the horsemen; these he bade hold in
2325,BOOK IV.,"their horses nor be entangled in the throng. “Neither let any man,"
2326,BOOK IV.,"trusting in his horsemanship and manhood, be eager to fight the Trojans"
2327,BOOK IV.,"alone before the rest, nor yet let him draw back, for so will ye be"
2328,BOOK IV.,enfeebled. But whomsoever a warrior from the place of his own car can
2329,BOOK IV.,"come at a chariot of the foe, let him thrust forth with his spear; even"
2330,BOOK IV.,so is the far better way. Thus moreover did men of old time lay low
2331,BOOK IV.,"cities and walls, because they had this mind and spirit in their"
2332,BOOK IV.,breasts.”
2333,BOOK IV.,
2334,BOOK IV.,"So did the old man charge them, being well skilled of yore in battles."
2335,BOOK IV.,"And lord Agamemnon rejoiced to see hem, and spake to him winged words,"
2336,BOOK IV.,"and said: “Old man, would to god that, even as thy spirit is in thine"
2337,BOOK IV.,"own breast, thy limbs might obey and thy strength be unabated. But the"
2338,BOOK IV.,common lot of age is heavy upon thee; would that it had come upon some
2339,BOOK IV.,"other man, and thou wert amid the young.”"
2340,BOOK IV.,
2341,BOOK IV.,"Then knightly Nestor of Gerenia answered him: “Atreides, I verily, even"
2342,BOOK IV.,"I too, would wish to be as on the day when I slew noble Ereuthalion."
2343,BOOK IV.,But the gods in no wise grant men all things at once. As I was then a
2344,BOOK IV.,"youth, so doth old age now beset me. Yet even so will I abide among the"
2345,BOOK IV.,horsemen and urge them by counsel and words; for that is the right of
2346,BOOK IV.,"elders. But the young men shall wield the spear, they that are more"
2347,BOOK IV.,youthful than I and have confidence in their strength.”
2348,BOOK IV.,
2349,BOOK IV.,"So spake he, and Atreides passed on glad at heart. He found Menestheus"
2350,BOOK IV.,"the charioteer, the son of Peteos, standing still, and round him were"
2351,BOOK IV.,"the Athenians, masters of the battle-cry. And hard by stood crafty"
2352,BOOK IV.,"Odysseus, and round about him the ranks of Kephallenians, no feeble"
2353,BOOK IV.,"folk, stood still; for their host had not yet heard the battle-cry,"
2354,BOOK IV.,seeing the battalions of horse-taming Trojans and Achaians had but just
2355,BOOK IV.,bestirred them to move; so these stood still tarrying till some other
2356,BOOK IV.,column of the Achaians should advance to set upon the Trojans and begin
2357,BOOK IV.,"the battle. But when Agamemnon king of men saw it, he upbraided them,"
2358,BOOK IV.,"and spake to them winged words, saying: “O son of king Peteos"
2359,BOOK IV.,"fosterling of Zeus, and thou skilled in evil wiles, thou cunning of"
2360,BOOK IV.,"mind, why stand ye shrinking apart, and tarry for others? You beseemeth"
2361,BOOK IV.,it to stand in your place amid the foremost and to front the fiery
2362,BOOK IV.,"battle; for ye are the first to hear my bidding to the feast, as oft as"
2363,BOOK IV.,we Achaians prepare a feast for the counsellors. Then are ye glad to
2364,BOOK IV.,eat roast meat and drink your cups of honey-sweet wine as long as ye
2365,BOOK IV.,"will. But now would ye gladly behold it, yea, if ten columns of"
2366,BOOK IV.,Achaians in front of you were fighting with the pitiless sword.”
2367,BOOK IV.,
2368,BOOK IV.,But Odysseus of many counsels looked fiercely at him and said:
2369,BOOK IV.,"“Atreides, what word is this that hath escaped the barrier of thy lips?"
2370,BOOK IV.,How sayest thou that we are slack in battle? When once our* Achaians
2371,BOOK IV.,"launch furious war on the Trojans, tamers of horses, then shalt thou,"
2372,BOOK IV.,"if thou wilt, and if thou hast any care therefor, behold Telemachos’"
2373,BOOK IV.,"dear father mingling with the champions of the Trojans, the tamers of"
2374,BOOK IV.,horses. But that thou sayest is empty as air.”
2375,BOOK IV.,
2376,BOOK IV.,"* Or, “that we are slack in battle, when once we Achaians,” putting the"
2377,BOOK IV.,note of interrogation after “tamers of horses.”
2378,BOOK IV.,
2379,BOOK IV.,
2380,BOOK IV.,"Then lord Agamemnon spake to him smiling, seeing how he was wroth, and"
2381,BOOK IV.,"took back his saying: “Heaven-sprung son of Laertes, Odysseus full of"
2382,BOOK IV.,"devices, neither do I chide thee beyond measure nor urge thee; for I"
2383,BOOK IV.,know that thy heart within thy breast is kindly disposed; for thy
2384,BOOK IV.,"thoughts are as my thoughts. Go to, we will make amends hereafter, if"
2385,BOOK IV.,any ill word hath been spoken now; may the gods bring it all to none
2386,BOOK IV.,effect.”
2387,BOOK IV.,
2388,BOOK IV.,So saying he left them there and went on to others. The son of Tydeus
2389,BOOK IV.,"found he, high-hearted Diomedes, standing still with horses and chariot"
2390,BOOK IV.,well compact; and by him stood Sthenelos son of Kapaneus. Him lord
2391,BOOK IV.,"Agamemnon saw and upbraided, and spake to him winged words, and said:"
2392,BOOK IV.,"“Ah me, thou son of wise Tydeus tamer of horses, why shrinkest thou,"
2393,BOOK IV.,why gazest thou at the highways of the battle? Not thus was Tydeus wont
2394,BOOK IV.,"to shrink, but rather to fight his enemies far in front of his dear"
2395,BOOK IV.,"comrades, as they say that beheld him at the task; for never did I meet"
2396,BOOK IV.,"him nor behold him, but men say that he was preeminent amid all. Of a"
2397,BOOK IV.,"truth he came to Mykene, not in enmity, but as a guest with godlike"
2398,BOOK IV.,"Polyneikes, to raise him an army for the war that they were levying"
2399,BOOK IV.,against the holy walls of Thebes; and they besought earnestly that
2400,BOOK IV.,"valiant allies might be given them, and our folk were fain to grant"
2401,BOOK IV.,"them and made assent to their entreaty, only Zeus showed omens of ill"
2402,BOOK IV.,and turned their minds. So when these were departed and were come on
2403,BOOK IV.,"their way, and had attained to Asopos deep in rushes, that maketh his"
2404,BOOK IV.,"bed in grass, there did the Achaians appoint Tydeus to be their"
2405,BOOK IV.,ambassador. So he went and found the multitude of the sons of Kadmos
2406,BOOK IV.,"feasting in the palace of mighty Eteokles. Yet was knightly Tydeus,"
2407,BOOK IV.,"even though a stranger, not afraid, being alone amid the multitude of"
2408,BOOK IV.,"the Kadmeians, but challenged them all to feats of strength, and in"
2409,BOOK IV.,every one vanquished he them easily; so present a helper was Athene
2410,BOOK IV.,"unto him. But the Kadmeians, the urgers of horses, were wroth, and as"
2411,BOOK IV.,"he fared back again they brought and set a strong ambush, even fifty"
2412,BOOK IV.,"young men, whose leaders were twain, Maion son of Haimon, like to the"
2413,BOOK IV.,"immortals, and Autophonos’ son Polyphontes staunch in battle. Still"
2414,BOOK IV.,"even on the Tydeus brought shameful death; he slew them all, save one"
2415,BOOK IV.,that he sent home alone; Maion to wit he sent away in obedience to the
2416,BOOK IV.,omens of heaven. Such was Tydeus of Aitolia; but he begat a son that in
2417,BOOK IV.,battle is worse than he; only in harangue is he the better.”
2418,BOOK IV.,
2419,BOOK IV.,"So said he, and stalwart Diomedes made no answer, but had respect to"
2420,BOOK IV.,the chiding of the king revered. But the son of glorious Kapaneus
2421,BOOK IV.,"answered him: “Atreides, utter not falsehood, seeing thou knowest how"
2422,BOOK IV.,to speak truly. We avow ourselves to be better men by far than our
2423,BOOK IV.,"fathers were: we did take the seat of Thebes the seven gated, though we"
2424,BOOK IV.,"led a scantier host against a stronger wall, because we followed the"
2425,BOOK IV.,omens of the gods and the salvation of Zeus; but they perished by their
2426,BOOK IV.,own iniquities. Do not thou therefore in any wise have our fathers in
2427,BOOK IV.,like honour with us.”
2428,BOOK IV.,
2429,BOOK IV.,"But stalwart Diomedes looked sternly at him, and said: “Brother, sit"
2430,BOOK IV.,silent and obey my saying. I grudge not that Agamemnon shepherd of the
2431,BOOK IV.,host should urge on the well-greaved Achaians to fight; for him the
2432,BOOK IV.,glory will attend if the Achaians lay the Trojans low and take holy
2433,BOOK IV.,Ilios; and his will be the great sorrow if the Achaians be laid low. Go
2434,BOOK IV.,"to now, let us too bethink us of impetuous valour.”"
2435,BOOK IV.,
2436,BOOK IV.,"He spake and leapt in his armour from the chariot to earth, and"
2437,BOOK IV.,terribly rang the bronze upon the chieftain’s breast as he moved;
2438,BOOK IV.,thereat might fear have come even upon one stout-hearted.
2439,BOOK IV.,
2440,BOOK IV.,As when on the echoing beach the sea-wave lifteth up itself in close
2441,BOOK IV.,array before the driving of the west wind; out on the deep doth it
2442,BOOK IV.,"first raise its head, and then breaketh upon the land and belloweth"
2443,BOOK IV.,"aloud and goeth with arching crest about the promontories, and speweth"
2444,BOOK IV.,the foaming brine afar; even so in close array moved the battalions of
2445,BOOK IV.,the Danaans without pause to battle. Each captain gave his men the
2446,BOOK IV.,"word, and the rest went silently; thou wouldest not deem that all the"
2447,BOOK IV.,great host following them had any voice within their breasts; in
2448,BOOK IV.,silence feared they their captains. On every man glittered the
2449,BOOK IV.,"inwrought armour wherewith they went clad. But for the Trojans, like"
2450,BOOK IV.,sheep beyond number that stand in the courtyard of a man of great
2451,BOOK IV.,"substance, to be milked of their white milk, and bleat without ceasing"
2452,BOOK IV.,"to hear their lambs’ cry, even so arose the clamour of the Trojans"
2453,BOOK IV.,through the wide host. For they had not all like speech nor one
2454,BOOK IV.,"language, but their tongues were mingled, and they were brought from"
2455,BOOK IV.,"many lands. These were urged on of Ares, and those of bright-eyed"
2456,BOOK IV.,"Athene, and Terror and Rout, and Strife whose fury wearieth not, sister"
2457,BOOK IV.,"and friend of murderous Ares; her crest is but lowly at the first, but"
2458,BOOK IV.,afterward she holdeth up her head in heaven and her feet walk upon the
2459,BOOK IV.,"earth. She now cast common discord in their midst, as she fared through"
2460,BOOK IV.,the throng and made the lamentation of men to wax.
2461,BOOK IV.,
2462,BOOK IV.,"Now when they were met together and come unto one spot, then clashed"
2463,BOOK IV.,they targe and spear and fury of bronze-clad warrior; the bossed
2464,BOOK IV.,shields pressed each on each and mighty din arose. Then were heard the
2465,BOOK IV.,voice of groaning and the voice of triumph together of the slayers and
2466,BOOK IV.,"the slain, and the earth streamed with blood. As when two winter"
2467,BOOK IV.,torrents flow down the mountains to a watersmeet and join their furious
2468,BOOK IV.,"flood within the deep ravine from their great springs, and the shepherd"
2469,BOOK IV.,heareth the roaring far off among the hills: even so from the joining
2470,BOOK IV.,of battle came there forth shouting and travail. Antilochos first slew
2471,BOOK IV.,"a Trojan warrior in full array, valiant amid the champions, Echepolos"
2472,BOOK IV.,son of Thalysios; him was he first to smite upon the ridge of his
2473,BOOK IV.,"crested helmet, and he drave the spear into his brow and the point of"
2474,BOOK IV.,"bronze passed within the bone; darkness clouded his eyes, and he"
2475,BOOK IV.,crashed like a tower amid the press of fight. As he fell lord Elephenor
2476,BOOK IV.,"caught him by the foot, Chalkodon’s son, captain of the great-hearted"
2477,BOOK IV.,"Abantes, and dragged him from beneath the darts, eager with all speed"
2478,BOOK IV.,to despoil him of his armour. Yet but for a little endured his essay;
2479,BOOK IV.,"great-hearted Agenor saw him haling away the corpse, and where his side"
2480,BOOK IV.,"was left uncovered of his buckler as he bowed him down, there smote he"
2481,BOOK IV.,him with bronze-tipped spear-shaft and unstrung his limbs. So his life
2482,BOOK IV.,"departed from him, and over his corpse the task of Trojans and Achaians"
2483,BOOK IV.,"grew hot; like wolves leapt they one at another, and man lashed at man."
2484,BOOK IV.,
2485,BOOK IV.,"Next Telamonian Aias smote Anthemion’s son, the lusty stripling"
2486,BOOK IV.,"Simoeisios, whose erst his mother bare beside the banks of Simoeis on"
2487,BOOK IV.,the way down from Ida whither she had followed with her parents to see
2488,BOOK IV.,"their flocks. Therefore they called him Simoeisios, but he repaid not"
2489,BOOK IV.,his dear parents the recompense of his nurture; scanty was his span of
2490,BOOK IV.,life by reason of the spear of great-hearted Aias that laid him low.
2491,BOOK IV.,For as he went he first was smitten on his right breast beside the pap;
2492,BOOK IV.,"straight through his shoulder passed the spear of bronze, and he fell"
2493,BOOK IV.,"to the ground in the dust like a poplar-tree, that hath grown up smooth"
2494,BOOK IV.,"in the lowland of a great marsh, and its branches grow upon the top"
2495,BOOK IV.,"thereof; this hath a wainwright felled with gleaming steel, to bend him"
2496,BOOK IV.,"a felloe for a goodly chariot, and so it lies drying by a river’s"
2497,BOOK IV.,banks. In such a fashion did heaven-sprung Aias slay Simoeisios son of
2498,BOOK IV.,"Anthemion; then at him Antiphos of the glancing corslet, Priam’s son,"
2499,BOOK IV.,"made a cast with his keen javelin across the throng. Him he missed, but"
2500,BOOK IV.,smote Odysseus’ valiant comrade Leukos in the groin as he drew the
2501,BOOK IV.,"corpse his way, so that he fell upon it and the body dropped from his"
2502,BOOK IV.,"hands. Then Odysseus was very wroth at heart for the slaying of him,"
2503,BOOK IV.,and strode through the forefront of the battle harnessed in flashing
2504,BOOK IV.,"bronze, and went and stood hard by and glanced around him, and cast his"
2505,BOOK IV.,bright javelin; and the Trojans shrank before the casting of the hero.
2506,BOOK IV.,"He sped not the dart in vain, but smote Demokoon, Priam’s bastard son"
2507,BOOK IV.,that had come to him from tending his fleet mares in Abydos. Him
2508,BOOK IV.,"Odysseus, being wroth for his comrade’s sake, smote with his javelin on"
2509,BOOK IV.,"one temple; and through both temples passed the point of bronze, and"
2510,BOOK IV.,"darkness clouded his eyes, and he fell with a crash and his armour"
2511,BOOK IV.,"clanged upon him. Then the forefighters and glorious Hector yielded,"
2512,BOOK IV.,"and the Argives shouted aloud, and drew the bodies unto them, and"
2513,BOOK IV.,"pressed yet further onward. But Apollo looked down from Pergamos, and"
2514,BOOK IV.,"had indignation, and with a shout called to the Trojans: “Arise, ye"
2515,BOOK IV.,"Trojans, tamers of horses; yield not to the Argives in fight; not of"
2516,BOOK IV.,"stone nor iron is their flesh, that it should resist the piercing"
2517,BOOK IV.,"bronze when they are smitten. Moreover Achilles, son of Thetis of the"
2518,BOOK IV.,"fair tresses, fighteth not, but amid the ships broodeth on his bitter"
2519,BOOK IV.,anger.”
2520,BOOK IV.,
2521,BOOK IV.,So spake the dread god from the city; and the Achaians likewise were
2522,BOOK IV.,"urged on of Zeus’ daughter the Triton-born, most glorious, as she"
2523,BOOK IV.,passed through the throng wheresoever she beheld them slackening.
2524,BOOK IV.,
2525,BOOK IV.,Next was Diores son of Amrynkeus caught in the snare of fate; for he
2526,BOOK IV.,"was smitten by a jagged stone on the right leg hard by the ankle, and"
2527,BOOK IV.,"the caster thereof was captain of the men of Thrace, Peiroös son of"
2528,BOOK IV.,Imbrasos that had come from Ainos. The pitiless stone crushed utterly
2529,BOOK IV.,"the two sinews and the bones; back fell he in the dust, and stretched"
2530,BOOK IV.,"out both his hands to his dear comrades, gasping out his soul. Then he"
2531,BOOK IV.,"that smote him, even Peiroos, sprang at him and pierced him with a"
2532,BOOK IV.,"spear beside the navel; so all his bowels gushed forth upon the ground,"
2533,BOOK IV.,and darkness clouded his eyes. But even as Peiroos departed from him
2534,BOOK IV.,"Thoas of Aitolia smote with a spear his chest above the pap, and the"
2535,BOOK IV.,"point fixed in his lung. Then Thoas came close, and plucked out from"
2536,BOOK IV.,"his breast the ponderous spear, and drew his sharp sword, wherewith he"
2537,BOOK IV.,"smote his belly in the midst, and took his life. Yet he stripped not"
2538,BOOK IV.,"off his armour; for his comrades, the men of Thrace that wear the"
2539,BOOK IV.,"top-knot, stood around, their long spears in their hands, and albeit he"
2540,BOOK IV.,was great and valiant and proud they drave him off from them and he
2541,BOOK IV.,gave ground reeling. So were the two captains stretched in the dust
2542,BOOK IV.,"side by side, he of the Thracians and he of the mail-clad Epeians; and"
2543,BOOK IV.,around them were many others likewise slain.
2544,BOOK IV.,
2545,BOOK IV.,"Now would none any more enter in and make light of the battle, could it"
2546,BOOK IV.,be that a man yet unwounded by dart or thrust of keen bronze might roam
2547,BOOK IV.,"in the midst, being led of Pallas Athene by the hand, and by her"
2548,BOOK IV.,guarded from the flying shafts. For many Trojans that day and many
2549,BOOK IV.,Achaians were laid side by side upon their faces in the dust.
2550,BOOK IV.,
2551,BOOK IV.,
2552,BOOK IV.,
2553,BOOK IV.,
2554,BOOK V.,BOOK V.
2555,BOOK V.,
2556,BOOK V.,
2557,BOOK V.,"How Diomedes by his great valour made havoc of the Trojans, and wounded"
2558,BOOK V.,even Aphrodite and Ares by the help of Athene.
2559,BOOK V.,
2560,BOOK V.,
2561,BOOK V.,"But now to Tydeus’ son Diomedes Pallas Athene gave might and courage,"
2562,BOOK V.,for him to be pre-eminent amid all the Argives and win glorious renown.
2563,BOOK V.,"She kindled flame unwearied from his helmet and shield, like to the"
2564,BOOK V.,star of summer that above all others glittereth bright after he hath
2565,BOOK V.,bathed in the ocean stream. In such wise kindled she flame from his
2566,BOOK V.,"head and shoulders and sent him into the midst, where men thronged the"
2567,BOOK V.,thickest.
2568,BOOK V.,
2569,BOOK V.,"Now there was amid the Trojans one Dares, rich and noble, priest of"
2570,BOOK V.,"Hephaistos; and he had two sons, Phegeus and Idaios, well skilled in"
2571,BOOK V.,all the art of battle. These separated themselves and assailed him face
2572,BOOK V.,"to face, they setting on him from their car and he on foot upon the"
2573,BOOK V.,"ground. And when they were now come near in onset on each other, first"
2574,BOOK V.,Phegeus hurled his far-shadowing spear; and over Tydeides’ left
2575,BOOK V.,"shoulder the spear point passed, and smote not his body. Then next"
2576,BOOK V.,"Tydeides made a spear-cast, and the javelin sped not from his hand in"
2577,BOOK V.,"vain, but smote his breast between the nipples, and thrust him from the"
2578,BOOK V.,"chariot. So Idaios sprang away, leaving his beautiful car, and dared"
2579,BOOK V.,not to bestride his slain brother; else had neither he himself escaped
2580,BOOK V.,black fate: but Hephaistos guarded him and saved him in a veil of
2581,BOOK V.,"darkness, that he might not have his aged priest all broken with"
2582,BOOK V.,sorrow. And the son of great-hearted Tydeus drave away the horses and
2583,BOOK V.,gave them to his men to take to the hollow ships. But when the
2584,BOOK V.,"great-hearted Trojans beheld the sons of Dares, how one was fled, and"
2585,BOOK V.,"one was slain beside his chariot, the spirit of all was stirred. But"
2586,BOOK V.,bright-eyed Athene took impetuous Ares by the hand and spake to him and
2587,BOOK V.,"said: “Ares, Ares, blood-stained bane of mortals, thou stormer of"
2588,BOOK V.,"walls, can we not now leave the Trojans and Achaians to fight, on"
2589,BOOK V.,whichsoever it be that father Zeus bestoweth glory? But let us twain
2590,BOOK V.,"give place, and escape the wrath of Zeus.”"
2591,BOOK V.,
2592,BOOK V.,So saying she led impetuous Ares from the battle. Then she made him sit
2593,BOOK V.,"down beside loud Skamandros, and the Danaans pushed the Trojans back."
2594,BOOK V.,Each one of the captains slew his man; first Agamemnon king of men
2595,BOOK V.,"thrust from his chariot the lord of the Halizonians, great Odios; for"
2596,BOOK V.,as he first turned to flight Agamemnon thrust his dart into his back
2597,BOOK V.,"between his shoulders, and drave it through his breast. And he fell"
2598,BOOK V.,"with a crash, and his armour clanged upon him."
2599,BOOK V.,
2600,BOOK V.,"And Idomeneus slew Phaistos son of Boros the Maionian, that came from"
2601,BOOK V.,deep-soiled Tarne. Him in the act to mount upon his car spear-famed
2602,BOOK V.,Idomeneus pierced with his long dart through his right shoulder; and he
2603,BOOK V.,fell from the car and hateful darkness gat hold of him.
2604,BOOK V.,
2605,BOOK V.,"Him then Idomeneus’ squires despoiled; and Skamandrios, son of"
2606,BOOK V.,"Strophios, cunning in the chase, fell to the keen-pointed spear of"
2607,BOOK V.,"Menelaos son of Atreus; even he the mighty hunter, whom Artemis herself"
2608,BOOK V.,had taught to shoot all manner of wild things that the mountain forest
2609,BOOK V.,breedeth. But now did Archer Artemis avail him naught nor all his
2610,BOOK V.,marksmanship wherein of old time he excelled; but spear-famed Menelaos
2611,BOOK V.,"son of Atreus smote him with his dart as he fled before him, in his"
2612,BOOK V.,"back [between his shoulders, and pierced through his breast]. So he"
2613,BOOK V.,fell prone and his armour clanged upon him.
2614,BOOK V.,
2615,BOOK V.,"And Meriones slew Phereklos, son of Tekton Harmon’s son, whose hands"
2616,BOOK V.,were cunning to make all manner of curious work; for Pallas Athene
2617,BOOK V.,loved him more than all men. He likewise built Alexandros the trim
2618,BOOK V.,"ships, source of ills, that were made the bane of all the Trojans and"
2619,BOOK V.,"of himself, because he knew not the oracles of heaven. Him Meriones"
2620,BOOK V.,"pursued, and overtaking him smote him in the right buttock, and right"
2621,BOOK V.,through passed the point straight to the bladder beneath the bone; and
2622,BOOK V.,"he fell to his knees with a cry, and death overshadowed him."
2623,BOOK V.,
2624,BOOK V.,"Then Meges slew Pedaios Antenor’s son, that was a bastard; yet goodly"
2625,BOOK V.,"Theano nurtured him carefully like to her own children, to do her"
2626,BOOK V.,"husband pleasure. To him Phyleus’ spear-famed son came near, and with"
2627,BOOK V.,keen dart smote him upon the sinew of the head; and right through amid
2628,BOOK V.,the teeth the point of bronze cleft the tongue’s root. So he fell in
2629,BOOK V.,"the dust, and bit the cold bronze with his teeth."
2630,BOOK V.,
2631,BOOK V.,"And by Eurypylos, Euaimon’s son, noble Hypsenor son of high-hearted"
2632,BOOK V.,Dolopion that was appointed Skamandros’ priest and like to a god was
2633,BOOK V.,"held in honour of the folk—by Eurypylos Euaimon’s glorious son, he as"
2634,BOOK V.,he fled before him was pursued and smitten on the shoulder with a
2635,BOOK V.,"sword-thrust, and his heavy arm was shorn away. All bleeding the arm"
2636,BOOK V.,fell upon the earth; and over his eyes came gloomy death and forceful
2637,BOOK V.,fate.
2638,BOOK V.,
2639,BOOK V.,So laboured these in the violent mellay; but of Tydeides man could not
2640,BOOK V.,"tell with whom he were joined, whether he consorted with Trojans or"
2641,BOOK V.,with Achaians. For he stormed across the plain like a winter torrent at
2642,BOOK V.,"the full, that in swift course scattereth the causeys; neither can the"
2643,BOOK V.,"long lines of* causeys hold it in, nor the fences of fruitful orchards"
2644,BOOK V.,stay its sudden coming when the rain of heaven driveth it; and so
2645,BOOK V.,before it perish in multitudes the fair works of the sons of men. Thus
2646,BOOK V.,"before Tydeides the serried battalions of the Trojans were overthrown,"
2647,BOOK V.,and they abode him not for all they were so many.
2648,BOOK V.,
2649,BOOK V.,"* Reading ἐερμέναι, with Aristarchos."
2650,BOOK V.,
2651,BOOK V.,
2652,BOOK V.,"But when Lykaon’s glorious son marked him storming across the plain,"
2653,BOOK V.,"overthrowing battalions before him, anon he bent his crooked bow"
2654,BOOK V.,"against Tydeides, and smote him as he sped onwards, hitting hard by his"
2655,BOOK V.,right shoulder the plate of his corslet; the bitter arrow flew through
2656,BOOK V.,"and held straight upon its way, and the corslet was dabbled with blood."
2657,BOOK V.,"Over him then loudly shouted Lykaon’s glorious son: “Bestir you,"
2658,BOOK V.,"great-hearted Trojans, urgers of horses; the best man of the Achaians"
2659,BOOK V.,"is wounded, and I deem that he shall not for long endure the violent"
2660,BOOK V.,"dart, if verily the king, the son of Zeus,* sped me on my way from"
2661,BOOK V.,Lykia.”
2662,BOOK V.,
2663,BOOK V.,* Apollo
2664,BOOK V.,
2665,BOOK V.,
2666,BOOK V.,So spake he boasting; yet was the other not vanquished of the swift
2667,BOOK V.,"dart, only he gave place and stood before his horses and his chariot"
2668,BOOK V.,"and spake to Sthenelos son of Kapaneus: “Haste thee, dear son of"
2669,BOOK V.,"Kapaneus; descend from thy chariot, to draw me from my shoulder the"
2670,BOOK V.,bitter arrow.”
2671,BOOK V.,
2672,BOOK V.,"So said he, and Sthenelos leapt from his chariot to earth and stood"
2673,BOOK V.,"beside him and drew the swift shaft right through, out of his shoulder;"
2674,BOOK V.,and the blood darted up through the pliant tunic. Then Diomedes of the
2675,BOOK V.,"loud war-cry prayed thereat: “Hear me, daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus,"
2676,BOOK V.,unwearied maiden! If ever in kindly mood thou stoodest by my father in
2677,BOOK V.,"the heat of battle, even so now be thou likewise kind to me, Athene."
2678,BOOK V.,"Grant me to slay this man, and bring within my spear-cast him that took"
2679,BOOK V.,"advantage to shoot me, and boasteth over me, deeming that not for long"
2680,BOOK V.,shall I see the bright light of the sun.”
2681,BOOK V.,
2682,BOOK V.,"So spake he in prayer, and Pallas Athene heard him, and made his limbs"
2683,BOOK V.,"nimble, his feet and his hands withal, and came near and spake winged"
2684,BOOK V.,"words: “Be of good courage now, Diomedes, to fight the Trojans; for in"
2685,BOOK V.,"thy breast I have set thy father’s courage undaunted, even as it was in"
2686,BOOK V.,"knightly Tydeus, wielder of the buckler. Moreover I have taken from"
2687,BOOK V.,"thine eyes the mist that erst was on them, that thou mayest well"
2688,BOOK V.,discern both god and man. Therefore if any god come hither to make
2689,BOOK V.,"trial of thee, fight not thou face to face with any of the immortal"
2690,BOOK V.,"gods; save only if Aphrodite daughter of Zeus enter into the battle,"
2691,BOOK V.,her smite thou with the keen bronze.”
2692,BOOK V.,
2693,BOOK V.,So saying bright-eyed Athene went her way and Tydeides returned and
2694,BOOK V.,entered the forefront of the battle; even though erst his soul was
2695,BOOK V.,"eager to do battle with the Trojans, yet now did threefold courage come"
2696,BOOK V.,"upon him, as upon a lion whom some shepherd in the field guarding his"
2697,BOOK V.,"fleecy sheep hath wounded, being sprung into the fold, yet hath not"
2698,BOOK V.,"vanquished him; he hath roused his might, and then cannot beat him"
2699,BOOK V.,"back, but lurketh amid the steading, and his forsaken flock is"
2700,BOOK V.,"affrighted; so the sheep are cast in heaps, one upon the other, and the"
2701,BOOK V.,lion in his fury leapeth out of the high fold; even so in fury mingled
2702,BOOK V.,mighty Diomedes with the Trojans.
2703,BOOK V.,
2704,BOOK V.,There slew he Astynoos and Hypeiron shepherd of the host; the one he
2705,BOOK V.,"pierced above the nipple with his bronze-shod dart, the other with his"
2706,BOOK V.,"great sword upon the collar-bone beside the shoulder he smote, and"
2707,BOOK V.,"severed the shoulder from neck and back. Them left he there, and"
2708,BOOK V.,"pursued after Abas and Polyidos, sons of old Eurydamas dreamer of"
2709,BOOK V.,"dreams; yet discerned he no dreams for them when they went,* but"
2710,BOOK V.,"stalwart Diomedes despoiled them. Then went he after Xanthos and Thoon,"
2711,BOOK V.,"sons of Phainops, striplings both; but their father was outworn of"
2712,BOOK V.,"grievous age, and begat no other son for his possessions after him."
2713,BOOK V.,"Then Diomedes slew them and bereft the twain of their dear life, and"
2714,BOOK V.,"for their father left only lamentation and sore distress, seeing he"
2715,BOOK V.,welcomed them not alive returned from battle; and kinsmen divided his
2716,BOOK V.,substance.
2717,BOOK V.,
2718,BOOK V.,"* Or, “yet came they not home for him to discern dreams for them.”"
2719,BOOK V.,
2720,BOOK V.,
2721,BOOK V.,"Then caught he two sons of Priam of the seed of Dardanos, riding in one"
2722,BOOK V.,"chariot, Echemmon and Chromios. As a lion leapeth among the kine and"
2723,BOOK V.,"breaketh the neck of cow or heifer grazing in a woodland pasture, so"
2724,BOOK V.,Tydeus’ son thrust in ill wise from their chariot both of them
2725,BOOK V.,"unwilling, and thereafter despoiled them of their arms; and the horses"
2726,BOOK V.,gave he to his comrades to drive them to the ships.
2727,BOOK V.,
2728,BOOK V.,"Him Aineias beheld making havoc of the ranks of warriors, and went his"
2729,BOOK V.,"way along the battle and amid the hurtling of spears, seeking godlike"
2730,BOOK V.,"Pandaros, if haply he might find him. Lykaon’s son he found, the noble"
2731,BOOK V.,"and stalwart, and stood before his face, and spake a word unto him."
2732,BOOK V.,"“Pandaros, where now are thy bow and thy winged arrows, and the fame"
2733,BOOK V.,"wherein no man of this land rivalleth thee, nor any in Lykia boasteth"
2734,BOOK V.,"to be thy better? Go to now, lift thy hands in prayer to Zeus and shoot"
2735,BOOK V.,"thy dart at this fellow, whoe’er he be that lordeth it here and hath"
2736,BOOK V.,"already wrought the Trojans much mischief, seeing he hath unstrung the"
2737,BOOK V.,knees of many a brave man; if indeed it be not some god wroth with the
2738,BOOK V.,"Trojans, in anger by reason of sacrifices; the wrath of god is a sore"
2739,BOOK V.,thing to fall on men.”*
2740,BOOK V.,
2741,BOOK V.,"* Or, “and the wrath of gods be heavy upon us.”"
2742,BOOK V.,
2743,BOOK V.,
2744,BOOK V.,"And Lykaon’s glorious son made answer to him: “Aineias, counsellor of"
2745,BOOK V.,"the mail-clad Trojans, in everything liken I him to the wise son of"
2746,BOOK V.,"Tydeus; I discern him by his shield and crested helmet, and by the"
2747,BOOK V.,aspect of his horses; yet know I not surely if it be not a god. But if
2748,BOOK V.,"it be the man I deem, even the wise son of Tydeus, then not without"
2749,BOOK V.,"help of a god is he thus furious, but some immortal standeth beside him"
2750,BOOK V.,with a cloud wrapped about his shoulders and turned aside from him my
2751,BOOK V.,swift dart even as it lighted. For already have I shot my dart at him
2752,BOOK V.,and smote his right shoulder right through the breastplate of his
2753,BOOK V.,"corslet, yea and I thought to hurl him headlong to Aidoneus, yet I"
2754,BOOK V.,vanquished him not; surely it is some wrathful god. And I have no
2755,BOOK V.,steeds at hand nor any chariot whereon to mount—yet in Lykaon’s halls
2756,BOOK V.,"are eleven fair chariots, new wrought, with gear all fresh, and cloths"
2757,BOOK V.,"spread over them; and beside each standeth a yoke of horses, champing"
2758,BOOK V.,white barley and spelt. Moreover Lykaon the aged spearman at my
2759,BOOK V.,departing laid instant charge upon me in our well-builded house; he
2760,BOOK V.,bade me mount horse and chariot to lead the Trojans in the violent
2761,BOOK V.,mellay; but I obeyed him not—far better had that been!—but spared the
2762,BOOK V.,horses lest in the great crowd of men they should lack fodder that had
2763,BOOK V.,been wont to feed their fill. Therefore I left them and am come on foot
2764,BOOK V.,"to Ilios, trusting to my bow; and now must my bow not help me! Already"
2765,BOOK V.,"have I aimed at two princes, Tydeus’ and Atreus’ sons, and both I smote"
2766,BOOK V.,"and surely drew forth blood, yet only roused them the more. Therefore"
2767,BOOK V.,in an evil hour I took from the peg my curved bow on that day when I
2768,BOOK V.,"led my Trojans to lovely Ilios, to do noble Hector pleasure. But if I"
2769,BOOK V.,return and mine eyes behold my native land and wife and great palace
2770,BOOK V.,"lofty-roofed, then may an alien forthwith cut my head from me if I"
2771,BOOK V.,break not this bow with mine hands and cast it upon the blazing fire;
2772,BOOK V.,worthless is its service to me as air.”
2773,BOOK V.,
2774,BOOK V.,"Then Aineias captain of the Trojans answered him: “Nay, talk not thus;"
2775,BOOK V.,naught shall be mended before that we with horses and chariot have gone
2776,BOOK V.,"to face this man, and made trial of him in arms. Come then, mount upon"
2777,BOOK V.,"my car that thou mayest see of what sort are the steeds of Tros, well"
2778,BOOK V.,skilled for following or for fleeing hither or thither very fleetly
2779,BOOK V.,"across the plain; they will e’en bring us to the city safe and sound,"
2780,BOOK V.,even though Zeus hereafter give victory to Diomedes son of Tydeus. Come
2781,BOOK V.,"therefore, take thou the lash and shining reins, and I will stand upon"
2782,BOOK V.,"the car to fight;* or else withstand thou him, and to the horses will I"
2783,BOOK V.,look.”
2784,BOOK V.,
2785,BOOK V.,"* Reading ἐπιβήσομαι, with Zenodotos."
2786,BOOK V.,
2787,BOOK V.,
2788,BOOK V.,"To him made answer Lykaon’s glorious son: “Aineias, take thou thyself"
2789,BOOK V.,the reins and thine own horses; better will they draw the curved car
2790,BOOK V.,"for their wonted charioteer, if perchance it hap that we must flee from"
2791,BOOK V.,Tydeus’ son; lest they go wild for fear and will not take us from the
2792,BOOK V.,"fight, for lack of thy voice, and so the son of great-hearted Tydeus"
2793,BOOK V.,attack us and slay us both and drive away the whole-hooved horses. So
2794,BOOK V.,"drive thou thyself thy chariot and thy horses, and I will await his"
2795,BOOK V.,onset with my keen spear.” So saying mounted they upon the well-dight
2796,BOOK V.,"chariot, and eagerly drave the fleet horses against Tydeides. And"
2797,BOOK V.,"Sthenelos, the glorious son of Kapaneus, saw them, and anon spake to"
2798,BOOK V.,"Tydeides winged words: “Diomedes son of Tydeus, dear to mine heart, I"
2799,BOOK V.,"behold two stalwart warriors eager to fight against thee, endued with"
2800,BOOK V.,"might beyond measure. The one is well skilled in the bow, even"
2801,BOOK V.,"Pandaros, and he moreover boasteth him to be Lykaon’s son; and Aineias"
2802,BOOK V.,"boasteth himself to be born son of great-hearted Anchises, and his"
2803,BOOK V.,"mother is Aphrodite. Come now, let us give place upon the chariot,"
2804,BOOK V.,"neither rage thou thus, I pray thee, in the forefront of battle, lest"
2805,BOOK V.,perchance thou lose thy life.”
2806,BOOK V.,
2807,BOOK V.,Then stalwart Diomedes looked sternly at him and said: “Speak to me no
2808,BOOK V.,"word of flight, for I ween that thou shalt not at all persuade me; not"
2809,BOOK V.,in my blood is it to fight a skulking fight or cower down; my force is
2810,BOOK V.,"steadfast still. I have no mind to mount the chariot, nay, even as I am"
2811,BOOK V.,will I go to face them; Pallas Athene biddeth me not be afraid. And as
2812,BOOK V.,"for these, their fleet horses shall not take both back from us again,"
2813,BOOK V.,"even if one or other escape. And this moreover tell I thee, and lay"
2814,BOOK V.,"thou it to heart: if Athene rich in counsel grant me this glory, to"
2815,BOOK V.,"slay them both, then refrain thou here these my fleet horses, and bind"
2816,BOOK V.,the reins tight to the chariot rim; and be mindful to leap upon
2817,BOOK V.,"Aineias’ horses, and drive them forth from the Trojans amid the"
2818,BOOK V.,well-greaved Achaians. For they are of that breed whereof farseeing*
2819,BOOK V.,"Zeus gave to Tros recompense for Ganymede his child, because they were"
2820,BOOK V.,the best of all horses beneath the daylight and the sun. That blood
2821,BOOK V.,"Anchises king of men stole of Laomedon, privily putting mares to them."
2822,BOOK V.,"Thereof a stock was born him in his palace, even six; four kept he"
2823,BOOK V.,"himself and reared them at the stall, and the other twain gave he to"
2824,BOOK V.,"Aineias deviser of rout.** Them could we seize, we should win us great"
2825,BOOK V.,renown.”

2831,BOOK V.,
2832,BOOK V.,
2833,BOOK V.,"In such wise talked they one to the other, and anon those other twain"
2834,BOOK V.,"came near, driving their fleet horses. First to him spake Lykaon’s"
2835,BOOK V.,"glorious son: “O thou strong-souled and cunning, son of proud Tydeus,"
2836,BOOK V.,"verily my swift dart vanquished thee not, the bitter arrow; so now will"
2837,BOOK V.,I make trial with my spear if I can hit thee.”
2838,BOOK V.,
2839,BOOK V.,"He spake and poised and hurled his far-shadowing spear, and smote upon"
2840,BOOK V.,Tydeides’ shield; right through it sped the point of bronze and reached
2841,BOOK V.,the breastplate. So over him shouted loudly Lykaon’s glorious son:
2842,BOOK V.,"“Thou art smitten on the belly right through, and I ween thou shalt not"
2843,BOOK V.,long hold up thine head; so thou givest me great renown.”
2844,BOOK V.,
2845,BOOK V.,"But mighty Diomedes unaffrighted answered him: “Thou hast missed, and"
2846,BOOK V.,not hit; but ye twain I deem shall not cease till one or other shall
2847,BOOK V.,have fallen and glutted with blood Ares the stubborn god of war.”
2848,BOOK V.,
2849,BOOK V.,So spake he and hurled; and Athene guided the dart upon his nose beside
2850,BOOK V.,"the eye, and it pierced through his white teeth. So the hard bronze cut"
2851,BOOK V.,through his tongue at the root and the point issued forth by the base
2852,BOOK V.,"of the chin. He fell from his chariot, and his splendid armour gleaming"
2853,BOOK V.,"clanged upon him, and the fleet-footed horses swerved aside; so there"
2854,BOOK V.,his soul and strength were unstrung.
2855,BOOK V.,
2856,BOOK V.,"Then Aineias leapt down with shield and long spear, fearing lest"
2857,BOOK V.,perchance the Achaians might take from him the corpse; and strode over
2858,BOOK V.,"him like a lion confident in his strength, and held before him his"
2859,BOOK V.,"spear and the circle of his shield, eager to slay whoe’er should come"
2860,BOOK V.,"to face him, crying his terrible cry. Then Tydeides grasped in his hand"
2861,BOOK V.,"a stone—a mighty deed—such as two men, as men now are, would not avail"
2862,BOOK V.,to lift; yet he with ease wielded it all alone. Therewith he smote
2863,BOOK V.,"Aineias on the hip where the thigh turneth in the hip-joint, and this"
2864,BOOK V.,"men call the “cup-bone.” So he crushed his cup-bone, and brake both"
2865,BOOK V.,"sinews withal, and the jagged stone tore apart the skin. Then the hero"
2866,BOOK V.,stayed fallen upon his knees and with stout hand leant upon the earth;
2867,BOOK V.,and the darkness of night veiled his eyes. And now might Aineias king
2868,BOOK V.,"of men have perished, but that Aphrodite daughter of Zeus was swift to"
2869,BOOK V.,"mark, even his mother that conceived him by Anchises as he tended the"
2870,BOOK V.,"kine. About her dear son wound she her white arms, and spread before"
2871,BOOK V.,"his face a fold of her radiant vesture, to be a covering from the"
2872,BOOK V.,"darts, lest any of the fleet-horsed Danaans might hurl the spear into"
2873,BOOK V.,his breast and take away his life.
2874,BOOK V.,
2875,BOOK V.,So was she bearing her dear son away from battle; but the son of
2876,BOOK V.,Kapaneus forgat not the behest that Diomedes of the loud war-cry had
2877,BOOK V.,laid upon him; he refrained his own whole-hooved horses away from the
2878,BOOK V.,"tumult, binding the reins tight to the chariot-rim, and leapt on the"
2879,BOOK V.,"sleek-coated horses of Aineias, and drave them from the Trojans to the"
2880,BOOK V.,"well-greaved Achaians, and gave them to Deïpylos his dear comrade whom"
2881,BOOK V.,"he esteemed above all that were his age-fellows, because he was"
2882,BOOK V.,like-minded with himself; and bade him drive them to the hollow ships.
2883,BOOK V.,Then did the hero mount his own chariot and take the shining reins and
2884,BOOK V.,"forthwith drive his strong-hooved horses in quest of Tydeides, eagerly."
2885,BOOK V.,"Now Tydeides had made onslaught with pitiless weapon on Kypris,*"
2886,BOOK V.,knowing how she was a coward goddess and none of those that have
2887,BOOK V.,mastery in battle of the warriors—no Athene she nor Enyo waster of
2888,BOOK V.,cities. Now when he had pursued her through the dense throng and come
2889,BOOK V.,"on her, then great-hearted Tydeus’ son thrust with his keen spear, and"
2890,BOOK V.,leapt on her and wounded the skin of her weak hand; straight through
2891,BOOK V.,the ambrosial raiment that the Graces themselves had woven her pierced
2892,BOOK V.,"the dart into the flesh, above the springing of the palm. Then flowed"
2893,BOOK V.,"the goddess’s immortal blood, such ichor as floweth in the blessed"
2894,BOOK V.,"gods; for they eat no bread neither drink they gleaming wine, wherefore"
2895,BOOK V.,they are bloodless and are named immortals. And she with a great cry
2896,BOOK V.,let fall her son: him Phoebus Apollo took into his arms and saved him
2897,BOOK V.,"in a dusky cloud, lest any of the fleet-horsed Danaans might hurl the"
2898,BOOK V.,spear into his breast and take away his life. But over her Diomedes of
2899,BOOK V.,"the loud war-cry shouted afar: “Refrain thee, thou daughter of Zeus,"
2900,BOOK V.,from war and fighting. Is it not enough that thou beguilest feeble
2901,BOOK V.,"women? But if in battle thou wilt mingle, verily I deem that thou shalt"
2902,BOOK V.,"shudder at the name of battle, if thou hear it even afar off.”"
2903,BOOK V.,
2904,BOOK V.,* Aphrodite.
2905,BOOK V.,
2906,BOOK V.,
2907,BOOK V.,"So spake he, and she departed in amaze and was sore troubled: and"
2908,BOOK V.,wind-footed Iris took her and led her from the throng tormented with
2909,BOOK V.,"her pain, and her fair skin was stained. There found she impetuous Ares"
2910,BOOK V.,"sitting, on the battle’s left; and his spear rested upon a cloud, and"
2911,BOOK V.,his fleet steeds. Then she fell on her knees and with instant prayer
2912,BOOK V.,besought of her dear brother his golden-frontleted steeds: “Dear
2913,BOOK V.,"brother, save me and give me thy steeds, that I may win to Olympus,"
2914,BOOK V.,where is the habitation of the immortals. Sorely am I afflicted with a
2915,BOOK V.,"wound wherewith a mortal smote me, even Tydeides, who now would fight"
2916,BOOK V.,even with father Zeus.”
2917,BOOK V.,
2918,BOOK V.,"So spake she, and Ares gave her his golden-frontleted steeds, and she"
2919,BOOK V.,"mounted on the chariot sore at heart. By her side mounted Iris, and in"
2920,BOOK V.,her hands grasped the reins and lashed the horses to start them; and
2921,BOOK V.,they flew onward nothing loth. Thus soon they came to the habitation of
2922,BOOK V.,"the gods, even steep Olympus. There wind-footed fleet Iris loosed the"
2923,BOOK V.,"horses from the chariot and stabled them, and set ambrosial forage"
2924,BOOK V.,before them; but fair Aphrodite fell upon Dione’s knees that was her
2925,BOOK V.,mother. She took her daughter in her arms and stroked her with her
2926,BOOK V.,"hand, and spake and called upon her name: “Who now of the sons of"
2927,BOOK V.,"heaven, dear child, hath entreated thee thus wantonly, as though thou"
2928,BOOK V.,wert a wrong-doer in the face of all?”
2929,BOOK V.,
2930,BOOK V.,Then laughter-loving Aphrodite made answer to her: “Tydeus’ son wounded
2931,BOOK V.,"me, high-hearted Diomedes, because I was saving from the battle my dear"
2932,BOOK V.,"son Aineias, who to me is dearest far of all men. For no more is the"
2933,BOOK V.,"fierce battle-cry for Trojans and Achaians, but the Danaans now are"
2934,BOOK V.,fighting even the immortals.”
2935,BOOK V.,
2936,BOOK V.,"Then the fair goddess Dione answered her: “Be of good heart, my child,"
2937,BOOK V.,and endure for all thy pain; for many of us that inhabit the mansions
2938,BOOK V.,"of Olympus have suffered through men, in bringing grievous woes one"
2939,BOOK V.,"upon another. So suffered Ares, when Otos and stalwart Ephialtes, sons"
2940,BOOK V.,"of Aloeus, bound him in a strong prison-house; yea in a vessel of"
2941,BOOK V.,bronze lay he bound thirteen months. Then might Ares insatiate of
2942,BOOK V.,"battle have perished, but that the step-mother of Aloeus’ sons, fair"
2943,BOOK V.,"Eëriboia, gave tidings to Hermes, and he stole away Ares, already"
2944,BOOK V.,pining; for the grievous prison-house was wearing him out. So suffered
2945,BOOK V.,Hera when Amphitryon’s stalwart son smote her on the right breast with
2946,BOOK V.,"a three-barbed arrow, so that pain unassuageable gat hold of her"
2947,BOOK V.,"likewise. So suffered awful Hades a swift arrow like the rest, when"
2948,BOOK V.,"this same man, the son of aegis-bearing Zeus, smote him in Pylos* amid"
2949,BOOK V.,the dead and gave him over to anguish. And he went to the mansion of
2950,BOOK V.,"Zeus and to high Olympus, grieved at heart, pierced through with"
2951,BOOK V.,"anguish; for the arrow was driven into his stout shoulder, and vexed"
2952,BOOK V.,his soul. But Paieon spread soothing drugs upon the wound and healed
2953,BOOK V.,him; seeing that verily he was of no mortal substance. Headstrong man
2954,BOOK V.,"and violent of deed, that recked not of his evil doings, and with his"
2955,BOOK V.,archery vexed the gods that dwell in Olympus! So upon thee was this man
2956,BOOK V.,sent by the bright-eyed goddess Athene; fond man—for the heart of
2957,BOOK V.,"Tydeus’ son knoweth not this, that he of a surety is not long-lived"
2958,BOOK V.,"that fighteth with immortals, nor ever do his children prattle upon his"
2959,BOOK V.,knees at his returning from war and terrible fray. Therefore now let
2960,BOOK V.,"Tydeides, though he be very mighty, beware lest one better than thou"
2961,BOOK V.,"encounter him; and so Aigialeia, wise daughter of Adrestos, wake from"
2962,BOOK V.,"sleep with lamentations all her household, bewailing her wedded lord,"
2963,BOOK V.,"the best man of the Achaians, even she that is the brave wife of"

2970,BOOK V.,"comforted, and the grievous pangs assuaged. But Athene and Hera beheld,"
2971,BOOK V.,and with bitter words provoked Zeus the son of Kronos. Of them was the
2972,BOOK V.,"bright-eyed goddess Athene first to speak: “Father Zeus, wilt thou"
2973,BOOK V.,indeed be wroth with me whate’er I say? Verily I ween that Kypris was
2974,BOOK V.,urging some woman of Achaia to join her unto the Trojans whom she so
2975,BOOK V.,marvellously loveth; and stroking such an one of the fair-robed women
2976,BOOK V.,"of Achaia, she tore upon the golden brooch her delicate hand.”"
2977,BOOK V.,
2978,BOOK V.,"So spake she, and the father of gods and men smiled, and called unto"
2979,BOOK V.,"him golden Aphrodite and said: “Not unto thee, my child, are given the"
2980,BOOK V.,"works of war; but follow thou after the loving tasks of wedlock, and to"
2981,BOOK V.,all these things shall fleet Ares and Athene look.”
2982,BOOK V.,
2983,BOOK V.,"Now while they thus spake in converse one with the other, Diomedes of"
2984,BOOK V.,"the loud war-cry leapt upon Aineias, knowing full well that Apollo"
2985,BOOK V.,himself had spread his arms over him; yet reverenced he not even the
2986,BOOK V.,"great god, but still was eager to slay Aineias and strip from him his"
2987,BOOK V.,"glorious armour. So thrice he leapt on him, fain to slay him, and"
2988,BOOK V.,thrice Apollo beat back his glittering shield. And when the fourth time
2989,BOOK V.,"he sprang at him like a god, then Apollo the Far-darter spake to him"
2990,BOOK V.,"with terrible shout: “Think, Tydeides, and shrink, nor desire to match"
2991,BOOK V.,thy spirit with gods; seeing there is no comparison of the race of
2992,BOOK V.,immortal gods and of men that walk upon the earth.”
2993,BOOK V.,
2994,BOOK V.,"So said he, and Tydeides shrank a short space backwards, to avoid the"
2995,BOOK V.,wrath of Apollo the Far-darter. Then Apollo set Aineias away from the
2996,BOOK V.,throng in holy Pergamos where his temple stood. There Leto and Archer
2997,BOOK V.,"Artemis healed him in the mighty sanctuary, and gave him glory; but"
2998,BOOK V.,"Apollo of the silver bow made a wraith like unto Aineias’ self, and in"
2999,BOOK V.,such armour as his; and over the wraith Trojans and goodly Achaians
3000,BOOK V.,"each hewed the others’ bucklers on their breasts, their round shields"
3001,BOOK V.,and fluttering targes.
3002,BOOK V.,
3003,BOOK V.,"Then to impetuous Ares said Phoebus Apollo: “Ares, Ares, blood-stained"
3004,BOOK V.,"bane of mortals, thou stormer of walls, wilt thou not follow after this"
3005,BOOK V.,"man and withdraw him from the battle, this Tydeides, who now would"
3006,BOOK V.,fight even with father Zeus? First in close fight he wounded Kypris in
3007,BOOK V.,"her hand hard by the wrist, and then sprang he upon myself like unto a"
3008,BOOK V.,god.”
3009,BOOK V.,
3010,BOOK V.,"So saying he sate himself upon the height of Pergamos, and baleful Ares"
3011,BOOK V.,entered among the Trojan ranks and aroused them in the likeness of
3012,BOOK V.,"fleet Akamas, captain of the Thracians. On the heaven-nurtured sons of"
3013,BOOK V.,"Priam he called saying: “O ye sons of Priam, the heaven-nurtured king,"
3014,BOOK V.,how long will ye yet suffer your host to be slain of the Achaians?
3015,BOOK V.,Shall it be even until they fight about our well-builded gates? Low
3016,BOOK V.,"lieth the warrior whom we esteemed like unto goodly Hector, even"
3017,BOOK V.,"Aineias son of Anchises great of heart. Go to now, let us save from the"
3018,BOOK V.,tumult our valiant comrade.”
3019,BOOK V.,
3020,BOOK V.,So saying he aroused the spirit and soul of every man. Thereat Sarpedon
3021,BOOK V.,"sorely chode noble Hector: “Hector, where now is the spirit gone that"
3022,BOOK V.,erst thou hadst? Thou saidst forsooth that without armies or allies
3023,BOOK V.,"thou wouldest hold the city, alone with thy sisters’ husbands and thy"
3024,BOOK V.,"brothers; but now can I not see any of these neither perceive them, but"
3025,BOOK V.,they are cowering like hounds about a lion; and we are fighting that
3026,BOOK V.,are but allies among you. Yea I being an ally am come from very far;
3027,BOOK V.,"far off is Lykia upon eddying Xanthos, where I left my dear wife and"
3028,BOOK V.,"infant son, and left my great wealth that each one coveteth that is in"
3029,BOOK V.,"need. Yet for all that I urge on my Lykians, and myself am eager to"
3030,BOOK V.,"fight my man, though here is naught of mine such as the Achaians might"
3031,BOOK V.,"plunder or harry. But thou standest, nay thou dost not even urge all"
3032,BOOK V.,"thine hosts to abide and guard their wives. Only beware lest, as though"
3033,BOOK V.,"tangled in meshes of all-ensnaring flax, ye be made unto your foemen a"
3034,BOOK V.,prey and a spoil; and they will soon lay waste your well-peopled city.
3035,BOOK V.,Thee it behoveth to give thought to all these things both by night and
3036,BOOK V.,"day, and to beseech the captains of thy far-famed allies to hold on"
3037,BOOK V.,unflinchingly; and so shalt thou put away their sore rebuking from
3038,BOOK V.,thee.”
3039,BOOK V.,
3040,BOOK V.,"So spake Sarpedon, and his word stung Hector to the heart, Forthwith he"
3041,BOOK V.,"leapt from his chariot in his armour to the earth, and brandishing two"
3042,BOOK V.,"keen spears went everywhere through the host, urging them to fight, and"
3043,BOOK V.,roused the dread battle-cry. So they were rallied and stood to face the
3044,BOOK V.,Achaians: and the Argives withstood them in close array and fled not.
3045,BOOK V.,Even as a wind carrieth the chaff about the sacred threshing-floors
3046,BOOK V.,"when men are winnowing, what time golden-haired Demeter in rush of wind"
3047,BOOK V.,"maketh division of grain and chaff, and so the chaff-heaps grow"
3048,BOOK V.,white—so now grew the Achaians white with falling dust which in their
3049,BOOK V.,"midst the horses’ hooves beat up into the brazen heaven, as fight was"
3050,BOOK V.,"joined again, and the charioteers wheeled round. Thus bare they forward"
3051,BOOK V.,the fury of their hands: and impetuous Ares drew round them a veil of
3052,BOOK V.,"night to aid the Trojans in the battle,* ranging everywhere; so"
3053,BOOK V.,"fulfilled he the behest of Phoebus Apollo of the golden sword, who bade"
3054,BOOK V.,him rouse the Trojans’ spirit when he beheld Pallas Athene departed;
3055,BOOK V.,for she was helper to the Danaans. And Apollo himself sent forth
3056,BOOK V.,"Aineias from his rich sanctuary and put courage in the heart of him,"
3057,BOOK V.,"shepherd of the hosts. So Aineias took his place amid his comrades, and"
3058,BOOK V.,they were glad to see him come among them alive and sound and full of
3059,BOOK V.,"valiant spirit. Yet they questioned him not at all, for all the toil"
3060,BOOK V.,forbade them that the god of the silver bow was stirring and Ares bane
3061,BOOK V.,of men and Strife raging insatiably.
3062,BOOK V.,
3063,BOOK V.,"* Or, drew round the battle a veil of night to help the Trojans."
3064,BOOK V.,
3065,BOOK V.,
3066,BOOK V.,And on the other side the two Aiantes and Odysseus and Diomedes stirred
3067,BOOK V.,the Danaans to fight; yet these of themselves feared neither the
3068,BOOK V.,"Trojans’ violence nor assaults, but stood like mists that Kronos’ son"
3069,BOOK V.,"setteth in windless air on the mountain tops, at peace, while the might"
3070,BOOK V.,of the north wind sleepeth and of all the violent winds that blow with
3071,BOOK V.,keen breath and scatter apart the shadowing clouds. Even so the Danaans
3072,BOOK V.,withstood the Trojans steadfastly and fled not. And Atreides ranged
3073,BOOK V.,"through the throng exhorting instantly: “My friends, quit you like men"
3074,BOOK V.,"and take heart of courage, and shun dishonour in one another’s eyes"
3075,BOOK V.,amid the stress of battle. Of men that shun dishonour more are saved
3076,BOOK V.,"than slain, but for them that flee is neither glory found nor any"
3077,BOOK V.,safety.”
3078,BOOK V.,
3079,BOOK V.,So saying he darted swiftly with his javelin and smote a foremost
3080,BOOK V.,"warrior, even great-hearted Aineias’ comrade Deïkoon son of Pergasos,"
3081,BOOK V.,"whom the Trojans held in like honour with Priam’s sons, because he was"
3082,BOOK V.,swift to do battle amid the foremost. Him lord Agamemnon smote with his
3083,BOOK V.,"dart upon the shield, and it stayed not the spear, but the point passed"
3084,BOOK V.,"through, so that he drave it through the belt into his nethermost"
3085,BOOK V.,belly: and he fell with a crash and his armour clanged upon him.
3086,BOOK V.,
3087,BOOK V.,"Then did Aineias slay two champions of the Danaans, even the sons of"
3088,BOOK V.,"Diokles, Krethon and Orsilochos, whose father dwelt in stablished"
3089,BOOK V.,"Phere, a man full of substance, whose lineage was of the river"
3090,BOOK V.,"Alpheios, that floweth in broad stream through the land of the Pylians;"
3091,BOOK V.,"Alpheios begat Orsilochos to be king of many men, and Orsilochos begat"
3092,BOOK V.,"great-hearted Diokles, and of Diokles were born twin sons, even Krethon"
3093,BOOK V.,"and Orsilochos, well skilled in all the ways of war. Now when these"
3094,BOOK V.,"were of full age, they bare the Argives company on their black ships to"
3095,BOOK V.,"Ilios home of horses, to win recompense for Atreus’ sons, Agamemnon and"
3096,BOOK V.,"Menelaos; but now the issue of death shrouded them about. Like them,"
3097,BOOK V.,two lions on the mountain tops are nurtured by their dam in the deep
3098,BOOK V.,forest thickets; and these harry the kine and goodly sheep and make
3099,BOOK V.,"havoc of the farmsteads of men, till in their turn they too are slain"
3100,BOOK V.,at men’s hands with the keen bronze; in such wise were these twain
3101,BOOK V.,vanquished at Aineias’ hands and fell like tall pine-trees.
3102,BOOK V.,
3103,BOOK V.,"But Menelaos dear to Ares had pity of them in their fall, and strode"
3104,BOOK V.,"through the forefront, harnessed in flashing bronze, brandishing his"
3105,BOOK V.,"spear; and Ares stirred his courage, with intent that he might fall"
3106,BOOK V.,"beneath Aineias’ hand. But Antilochos, great-hearted Nestor’s son,"
3107,BOOK V.,"beheld him, and strode through the forefront; because he feared"
3108,BOOK V.,"exceedingly for the shepherd of the host, lest aught befall him and"
3109,BOOK V.,disappoint them utterly of their labour. So those two were now holding
3110,BOOK V.,"forth their hands and sharp spears each against the other, eager to do"
3111,BOOK V.,battle; when Antilochos came and stood hard by the shepherd of the
3112,BOOK V.,"host. But Aineias faced them not, keen warrior though he was, when he"
3113,BOOK V.,beheld two men abiding side by side; so these haled away the corpses to
3114,BOOK V.,"the Achaians’ host, and laid the hapless twain in their comrades’ arms,"
3115,BOOK V.,and themselves turned back and fought on amid the foremost.
3116,BOOK V.,
3117,BOOK V.,"Then slew they Pylaimenes, peer of Ares, captain of the great-hearted"
3118,BOOK V.,"Paphlagonians bearers of the shield. Him as he stood still Atreus’ son,"
3119,BOOK V.,"spear-famed Menelaos, pierced with his javelin, smiting upon the"
3120,BOOK V.,"collar-bone; and Antilochos hurled at Mydon, his squire and charioteer,"
3121,BOOK V.,"Atymnios’ brave son, even as he was wheeling the whole-hooved horses,"
3122,BOOK V.,and with a stone smote his elbow in the midst; so the reins white with
3123,BOOK V.,"ivory fell from his hands to earth, even into the dust. Then Antilochos"
3124,BOOK V.,"sprang on him and drave the sword into his temple, and he fell gasping"
3125,BOOK V.,from the well-wrought chariot headlong in the dust on crown and
3126,BOOK V.,"shoulders. A while he stood there, being lighted on deep sand, until"
3127,BOOK V.,"his horses spurned him and cast him to earth, even in the dust; and"
3128,BOOK V.,"them Antilochos lashed, and drave them to the Achaians’ host."
3129,BOOK V.,
3130,BOOK V.,"But Hector marked them across the ranks, and sprang on them with a"
3131,BOOK V.,"shout, and the battalions of the Trojans followed him in their might:"
3132,BOOK V.,"and Ares led them on and dread Enyo, she bringing ruthless turmoil of"
3133,BOOK V.,"war, the while Ares wielded in his hands his monstrous spear, and"
3134,BOOK V.,"ranged now before Hector’s face, and now behind."
3135,BOOK V.,
3136,BOOK V.,Then Diomedes of the loud war-cry shuddered to behold him; and even as
3137,BOOK V.,a shiftless man crossing a great plain cometh on a swift-streaming
3138,BOOK V.,"river flowing on to the sea, and seeing it boil with foam springeth"
3139,BOOK V.,"backwards, even so now Tydeides shrank back and spake to the host:"
3140,BOOK V.,"“Friends, how marvel we that noble Hector is a spearman and bold man of"
3141,BOOK V.,war! Yet ever is there beside him some god that wardeth off
3142,BOOK V.,destruction; even as now Ares is there by him in likeness of a mortal
3143,BOOK V.,"man. But with faces towards the Trojans still give ground backwards,"
3144,BOOK V.,neither be desirous to fight amain with gods.”
3145,BOOK V.,
3146,BOOK V.,"So said he, and the Trojans came very close upon them. Then Hector slew"
3147,BOOK V.,"two that knew well the battle joy, riding in one chariot, even"
3148,BOOK V.,Menesthes and Anchialos. And the great Telamonian Aias had pity of them
3149,BOOK V.,"in their fall, and came hard by and darted with his bright javelin, and"
3150,BOOK V.,"smote Amphios son of Selagos, that dwelt in Paisos, a man rich in"
3151,BOOK V.,"substance, rich in meadow land; but fate led him to bring succour to"
3152,BOOK V.,"Priam and his sons. Him Telamonian Aias smote upon the belt, and in his"
3153,BOOK V.,nether belly the far-shadowing spear stuck and he fell with a crash.
3154,BOOK V.,"Then glorious Aias ran at him to strip him of his armour, and the"
3155,BOOK V.,"Trojans rained on him keen javelins glittering, and his shield caught"
3156,BOOK V.,many thereof. But he set his heel upon the corpse and plucked forth the
3157,BOOK V.,spear of bronze; only he could not strip from his shoulders all the
3158,BOOK V.,"fair armour therewith, being overwhelmed of spears. Moreover he feared"
3159,BOOK V.,"the haughty Trojans’ stout defence, they being many and brave that with"
3160,BOOK V.,"their spears pressed on him, so that for all he was so great and"
3161,BOOK V.,valiant and proud they thrust him from them; and he was shaken and
3162,BOOK V.,shrank back.
3163,BOOK V.,
3164,BOOK V.,"Thus toiled these in violent battle; and Tlepolemos son of Herakles,"
3165,BOOK V.,"valiant and tall, was driven of forceful fate against godlike Sarpedon."
3166,BOOK V.,"Then when the twain were come nigh in onset on each other, even the son"
3167,BOOK V.,"and grandson of Zeus the cloud-gatherer, then first to the other spake"
3168,BOOK V.,"Tlepolemos: “Sarpedon, counsellor of the Lykians, why must thou be"
3169,BOOK V.,"skulking here, being a man unskilled in battle? Falsely do men say that"
3170,BOOK V.,"thou art offspring of aegis-bearing Zeus, seeing thou art found lacking"
3171,BOOK V.,"greatly beside those men that in days of old were born of Zeus. Ah,"
3172,BOOK V.,"what an one do men say* was mighty Herakles, even my father the"
3173,BOOK V.,"steadfast lion-heart, who erst came hither for Laomedon’s mares with"
3174,BOOK V.,"but six ships and a scantier host, yet sacked the city of Ilios and"
3175,BOOK V.,"made her highways desolate. But thine is a base spirit, and thy folk"
3176,BOOK V.,are minishing. I ween that thou art in no wise come from Lykia to be a
3177,BOOK V.,"bulwark unto the Trojans, for all thy great strength, but that thou"
3178,BOOK V.,shalt be vanquished at my hand and pass the gates of Hades.”
3179,BOOK V.,
3180,BOOK V.,"* Or, “of other sort, men say,” if we read ἀλλοῖον for ἀλλ’ οῖον."
3181,BOOK V.,
3182,BOOK V.,
3183,BOOK V.,"Then Sarpedon captain of the Lykians answered him: “Tlepolemos, he"
3184,BOOK V.,"verily overthrew holy Ilios by the folly of the proud man Laomedon,"
3185,BOOK V.,"that rewarded his good deed with harsh upbraiding, and paid him not the"
3186,BOOK V.,steeds wherefor he came from afar. And for thee I say that slaughter
3187,BOOK V.,and black death shall come about here at my hands; vanquished by my
3188,BOOK V.,"spear thou shalt yield to me my glory, and thy life to Hades of the"
3189,BOOK V.,goodly steeds.”
3190,BOOK V.,
3191,BOOK V.,"So spake Sarpedon, and Tlepolemos lifted his ashen spear, and both"
3192,BOOK V.,their long javelins sped from their hands together. Sarpedon smote the
3193,BOOK V.,"midst of his neck, and the grievous point past right through, and the"
3194,BOOK V.,darkness of night fell on his eyes and shrouded him: and Tlepolemos
3195,BOOK V.,"with long spear smote the other’s left thigh, and the point sped"
3196,BOOK V.,"through furiously, grazing the bone; but his father yet warded off"
3197,BOOK V.,destruction.
3198,BOOK V.,
3199,BOOK V.,"So his goodly comrades bare away godlike Sarpedon from the battle, but"
3200,BOOK V.,"the long spear dragging was heavy upon him, and no man marked it or"
3201,BOOK V.,took thought in their haste to draw the ashen spear out from his thigh
3202,BOOK V.,that he might stand upright; such labour had they in tending him. And
3203,BOOK V.,over against them the well-greaved Achaians bare Tlepolemos from the
3204,BOOK V.,"battle. And noble Odysseus of the patient soul marked it, and his heart"
3205,BOOK V.,was stirred within him. Then doubted he in mind and soul whether first
3206,BOOK V.,"to pursue the son of Zeus the loud thunderer, or take the lives of the"
3207,BOOK V.,common sort of the Lykians. But it was not destined to great-hearted
3208,BOOK V.,Odysseus to slay with his keen blade the mighty son of Zeus; so Athene
3209,BOOK V.,turned his fury upon the multitude of the Lykians. Then slew he
3210,BOOK V.,Koiranos and Alastor and Chromios and Alkandros and Halios and Noëmon
3211,BOOK V.,and Prytanis; and yet more Lykians had noble Odysseus slain but that
3212,BOOK V.,"great Hector of the glancing helm was swift to mark him, and strode"
3213,BOOK V.,"through the forefront of battle, harnessed in flashing bronze, and"
3214,BOOK V.,brought terror to the Danaans; but Sarpedon the son of Zeus was glad at
3215,BOOK V.,"his coming, and spake to him a word of pain: “O son of Priam, let me"
3216,BOOK V.,"not now be left a prey unto the Danaans, but bring me succour; howbeit"
3217,BOOK V.,"thereafter let my life depart from me in your city, seeing it might not"
3218,BOOK V.,"be that I should return home to my dear native land, to make glad my"
3219,BOOK V.,dear wife and infant son.”
3220,BOOK V.,
3221,BOOK V.,"So said he, but Hector of the glancing helm spake no word to him, but"
3222,BOOK V.,"hastened on, desirous with all speed to thrust back the Argives and"
3223,BOOK V.,take the lives of many. So his goodly comrades made godlike Sarpedon to
3224,BOOK V.,"sit beneath a fair oak-tree of aegis-bearing Zeus, and valiant Pelagon"
3225,BOOK V.,that was his dear comrade thrust forth from his thigh the ashen spear;
3226,BOOK V.,and his spirit failed him and mist overspread his eyes. Then breathed
3227,BOOK V.,"he again, and the breath of the north wind blew round about him and"
3228,BOOK V.,brought him to life from the grievous swoon of his soul.
3229,BOOK V.,
3230,BOOK V.,Now the Argives before the face of Ares and mail-clad Hector neither
3231,BOOK V.,"turned them round about toward their black ships, nor charged forward"
3232,BOOK V.,"in battle, but still fell backward, when they heard of Ares amid the"
3233,BOOK V.,"Trojans. And now who first was slaughtered, and who last, by Hector son"
3234,BOOK V.,"of Priam and brazen Ares? Even godlike Teuthras, and thereafter Orestes"
3235,BOOK V.,"the charioteer, and Trechos spearman of Aitolia, and Oinomaos and"
3236,BOOK V.,"Helenos son of Oinops and Oresbios with gleaming taslets, who dwelt in"
3237,BOOK V.,"Hyle and had great care of his substance, lying beside the Kephisian"
3238,BOOK V.,"mere; and near him dwelt all the Boiotians, inhabiters of a full rich"
3239,BOOK V.,domain.
3240,BOOK V.,
3241,BOOK V.,Now when the white-armed goddess Hera marked them making havoc of the
3242,BOOK V.,"Argives in the press of battle, anon she spake winged words to Athene:"
3243,BOOK V.,"“Out on it, thou daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus, unwearied maiden! Was"
3244,BOOK V.,"it for naught we pledged our word to Menelaos, that he should not"
3245,BOOK V.,"depart till he had laid waste well-walled Ilios,—if thus we let baleful"
3246,BOOK V.,"Ares rage? Go to now, let us twain also take thought of impetuous"
3247,BOOK V.,valour.”
3248,BOOK V.,
3249,BOOK V.,"So said she, and the bright-eyed goddess Athene disregarded not. So"
3250,BOOK V.,"Hera the goddess queen, daughter of Kronos, went her way to harness the"
3251,BOOK V.,gold-frontleted steeds; and Hebe quickly put to the car the curved
3252,BOOK V.,"wheels of bronze, eight-spoked, upon their axle-tree of iron. Golden is"
3253,BOOK V.,"their felloe, imperishable, and tires of bronze are fitted thereover, a"
3254,BOOK V.,"marvel to look upon; and the naves are of silver, to turn about on"
3255,BOOK V.,"either side. And the car is plaited tight with gold and silver thongs,"
3256,BOOK V.,and two rails run round about it. And the silver pole stood out
3257,BOOK V.,"therefrom; upon the end bound she the fair golden yoke, and set thereon"
3258,BOOK V.,"the fair breaststraps of gold, and Hera led beneath the yoke the horses"
3259,BOOK V.,"fleet of foot, and hungered for strife and the battle-cry. And Athene,"
3260,BOOK V.,"daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus, cast down at her father’s threshold her"
3261,BOOK V.,"woven vesture many-coloured, that herself had wrought and her hands had"
3262,BOOK V.,"fashioned, and put on her the tunic of Zeus the cloud-gatherer, and"
3263,BOOK V.,arrayed her in her armour for dolorous battle. About her shoulders cast
3264,BOOK V.,"she the tasselled aegis terrible, whereon is Panic as a crown all round"
3265,BOOK V.,"about, and Strife is therein and Valour and horrible Onslaught withal,"
3266,BOOK V.,"and therein is the dreadful monster’s Gorgon head, dreadful and grim,"
3267,BOOK V.,portent of aegis-bearing Zeus. Upon her head set she the two-crested
3268,BOOK V.,"golden helm with fourfold plate, bedecked with men-at-arms of a hundred"
3269,BOOK V.,"cities. Upon the flaming chariot set she her foot, and grasped her"
3270,BOOK V.,"heavy spear, great and stout, wherewith she vanquisheth the ranks of"
3271,BOOK V.,"men, even of heroes with whom she of the awful sire is wroth. Then Hera"
3272,BOOK V.,swiftly smote the horses with the lash; self-moving groaned upon their
3273,BOOK V.,"hinges the gates of heaven whereof the Hours are warders, to whom is"
3274,BOOK V.,"committed great heaven and Olympus, whether to throw open the thick"
3275,BOOK V.,cloud or set it to. There through the gates guided they their horses
3276,BOOK V.,patient of the lash. And they found the son of Kronos sitting apart
3277,BOOK V.,from all the gods on the topmost peak of many-ridged Olympus. Then the
3278,BOOK V.,white-armed goddess Hera stayed her horses and questioned the most high
3279,BOOK V.,"Zeus, the son of Kronos, and said: “Father Zeus, hast thou no"
3280,BOOK V.,indignation with Ares for these violent deeds? How great and goodly a
3281,BOOK V.,"company of Achaians hath he destroyed recklessly and in unruly wise,"
3282,BOOK V.,unto my sorrow. But here in peace Kypris and Apollo of the silver bow
3283,BOOK V.,"take their pleasure, having set on this mad one that knoweth not any"
3284,BOOK V.,"law. Father Zeus, wilt thou at all be wroth with me if I smite Ares and"
3285,BOOK V.,chase him from the battle in sorry plight?”
3286,BOOK V.,
3287,BOOK V.,"And Zeus the cloud-gatherer answered and said to her: “Go to now, set"
3288,BOOK V.,"upon him Athene driver of the spoil, who most is wont to bring sore"
3289,BOOK V.,pain upon him.”
3290,BOOK V.,
3291,BOOK V.,"So spake he, and the white-armed goddess Hera disregarded not, and"
3292,BOOK V.,lashed her horses; they nothing loth flew on between earth and starry
3293,BOOK V.,heaven. As far as a man seeth with his eyes into the haze of distance
3294,BOOK V.,"as he sitteth on a place of outlook and gazeth over the wine-dark sea,"
3295,BOOK V.,so far leap the loudly neighing horses of the gods. Now when they came
3296,BOOK V.,"to Troy and the two flowing rivers, even to where Simoeis and"
3297,BOOK V.,"Skamandros join their streams, there the white-armed goddess Hera"
3298,BOOK V.,stayed her horses and loosed them from the car and poured thick mist
3299,BOOK V.,"round about them, and Simoeis made ambrosia spring up for them to"
3300,BOOK V.,graze. So the goddesses went their way with step like unto
3301,BOOK V.,"turtle-doves, being fain to bring succour to the men of Argos. And when"
3302,BOOK V.,"they were now come where the most and most valiant stood, thronging"
3303,BOOK V.,"about mighty Diomedes tamer of horses, in the semblance of ravening"
3304,BOOK V.,"lions or wild boars whose strength is nowise feeble, then stood the"
3305,BOOK V.,white-armed goddess Hera and shouted in the likeness of great-hearted
3306,BOOK V.,"Stentor with voice of bronze, whose cry was loud as the cry of fifty"
3307,BOOK V.,"other men: “Fie upon you, Argives, base things of shame, so brave in"
3308,BOOK V.,"semblance! While yet noble Achilles entered continually into battle,"
3309,BOOK V.,then issued not the Trojans even from the Dardanian gate; for they had
3310,BOOK V.,dread of his terrible spear. But now fight they far from the city at
3311,BOOK V.,the hollow ships.”
3312,BOOK V.,
3313,BOOK V.,So saying she aroused the spirit and soul of every man. And to
3314,BOOK V.,Tydeides’ side sprang the bright-eyed goddess Athene. That lord she
3315,BOOK V.,"found beside his horses and chariot, cooling the wound that Pandaros"
3316,BOOK V.,"with his dart had pierced, for his sweat vexed it by reason of the"
3317,BOOK V.,broad baldrick of his round shield; therewith was he vexed and his arm
3318,BOOK V.,"grew weary, so he was lifting up the baldrick and wiping away the dusky"
3319,BOOK V.,"blood. Then the goddess laid her hand on his horses’ yoke, and said:"
3320,BOOK V.,“Of a truth Tydeus begat a son little after his own likeness. Tydeus
3321,BOOK V.,"was short of stature, but a man of war; yea even when I would not have"
3322,BOOK V.,him fight nor make display—what time he came apart from the Achaians on
3323,BOOK V.,"an embassage to Thebes, to the midst of the multitude of the Kadmeians,"
3324,BOOK V.,"I bade him feast in their halls at peace; but he, possessing his"
3325,BOOK V.,"valiant soul as of old time, challenged the young men of the Kadmeians"
3326,BOOK V.,and in everything vanquished them [easily; so sure a helper was I unto
3327,BOOK V.,"him]. But for thee, beside thee stand I and guard thee and with all my"
3328,BOOK V.,heart bid thee fight the Trojans; yet either hath weariness of much
3329,BOOK V.,"striving entered into thy limbs, or disheartening terror hath taken"
3330,BOOK V.,"hold of thee. If that be so, no offspring art thou of Tydeus, the wise"
3331,BOOK V.,son of Oineus.”
3332,BOOK V.,
3333,BOOK V.,"And stalwart Diomedes made answer to her and said: “I know thee,"
3334,BOOK V.,goddess daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus: therefore with my whole heart
3335,BOOK V.,will I tell thee my thought and hide it not. Neither hath disheartening
3336,BOOK V.,"terror taken hold upon me, nor any faintness, but I am still mindful of"
3337,BOOK V.,thy behest that thou didst lay upon me. Thou forbadest me to fight face
3338,BOOK V.,"to face with all the blessed gods, save only if Zeus’ daughter"
3339,BOOK V.,"Aphrodite should enter into battle, then to wound her with the keen"
3340,BOOK V.,bronze. Therefore do I now give ground myself and have bidden all the
3341,BOOK V.,Argives likewise to gather here together; for I discern Ares lording it
3342,BOOK V.,in the fray.”
3343,BOOK V.,
3344,BOOK V.,Then the bright-eyed goddess Athene answered him: “Diomedes son of
3345,BOOK V.,"Tydeus, thou joy of mine heart, fear thou, for that, neither Ares nor"
3346,BOOK V.,"any other of the immortals; so great a helper am I to thee. Go to now,"
3347,BOOK V.,"at Ares first guide thou thy whole-hooved horses, and smite him hand to"
3348,BOOK V.,"hand, nor have any awe of impetuous Ares, raving here, a curse"
3349,BOOK V.,"incarnate, the renegade that of late in converse with me and Hera"
3350,BOOK V.,pledged him to fight against the Trojans and give succour to the
3351,BOOK V.,"Argives, but now consorteth with the Trojans and hath forgotten these.”"
3352,BOOK V.,
3353,BOOK V.,"So speaking, with her hand she drew back Sthenelos and thrust him from"
3354,BOOK V.,"the chariot to earth, and instantly leapt he down; so the goddess"
3355,BOOK V.,mounted the car by noble Diomedes’ side right eagerly. The oaken axle
3356,BOOK V.,"creaked loud with its burden, bearing the dread goddess and the man of"
3357,BOOK V.,might. Then Pallas Athene grasped the whip and reins; forthwith against
3358,BOOK V.,Ares first guided she the whole-hooved horses. Now he was stripping
3359,BOOK V.,"huge Periphas, most valiant far of the Aitolians, Ochesios’ glorious"
3360,BOOK V.,son. Him was blood-stained Ares stripping; and Athene donned the helm
3361,BOOK V.,"of Hades, that terrible Ares might not behold her. Now when Ares"
3362,BOOK V.,"scourge of mortals beheld noble Diomedes, he left huge Periphas lying"
3363,BOOK V.,"there, where at the first he had slain him and taken away his life, and"
3364,BOOK V.,made straight at Diomedes tamer of horses. Now when they were come nigh
3365,BOOK V.,"in onset on one another, first Ares thrust over the yoke and horse’s"
3366,BOOK V.,"reins with spear of bronze, eager to take away his life. But the"
3367,BOOK V.,bright-eyed goddess Athene with her hand seized the spear and thrust it
3368,BOOK V.,"up over* the car, to spend itself in vain. Next Diomedes of the loud"
3369,BOOK V.,war-cry attacked with spear of bronze; and Pallas Athene drave it home
3370,BOOK V.,"against Ares’ nethermost belly, where his taslets were girt about him."
3371,BOOK V.,"There smote he him and wounded him, rending through his fair skin, and"
3372,BOOK V.,plucked forth the spear again. Then brazen Ares bellowed loud as nine
3373,BOOK V.,thousand warriors or ten thousand cry in battle as they join in strife
3374,BOOK V.,"and fray. Thereat trembling gat hold of Achaians and Trojans for fear,"
3375,BOOK V.,so mightily bellowed Ares insatiate of battle.

3379,BOOK V.,
3380,BOOK V.,Even as gloomy mist appeareth from the clouds when after heat a stormy
3381,BOOK V.,"wind ariseth, even so to Tydeus’ son Diomedes brazen Ares appeared amid"
3382,BOOK V.,"clouds, faring to wide heaven. Swiftly came he to the gods’ dwelling,"
3383,BOOK V.,"steep Olympus, and sat beside Zeus son of Kronos with grief at heart,"
3384,BOOK V.,"and shewed the immortal blood flowing from the wound, and piteously"
3385,BOOK V.,"spake to him winged words: “Father Zeus, hast thou no indignation to"
3386,BOOK V.,behold these violent deeds? For ever cruelly suffer we gods by one
3387,BOOK V.,"another’s devices, in shewing men grace. With thee are we all at"
3388,BOOK V.,"variance, because thou didst beget that reckless maiden and baleful,"
3389,BOOK V.,whose thought is ever of iniquitous deeds. For all the other gods that
3390,BOOK V.,"are in Olympus hearken to thee, and we are subject every one; only her"
3391,BOOK V.,"thou chastenest not, neither in deed nor word, but settest her on,"
3392,BOOK V.,because this pestilent one is thine own offspring. Now hath she urged
3393,BOOK V.,"on Tydeus’ son, even overweening Diomedes, to rage furiously against"
3394,BOOK V.,"the immortal gods. Kypris first he wounded in close fight, in the wrist"
3395,BOOK V.,"of her hand, and then assailed he me, even me, with the might of a god."
3396,BOOK V.,Howbeit my swift feet bare me away; else had I long endured anguish
3397,BOOK V.,"there amid the grisly heaps of dead, or else had lived strengthless"
3398,BOOK V.,from the smitings of the spear.”
3399,BOOK V.,
3400,BOOK V.,"Then Zeus the cloud-gatherer looked sternly at him and said: “Nay, thou"
3401,BOOK V.,"renegade, sit not by me and whine. Most hateful to me art thou of all"
3402,BOOK V.,gods that dwell in Olympus: thou ever lovest strife and wars and
3403,BOOK V.,"battles. Truly thy mother’s spirit is intolerable, unyielding, even"
3404,BOOK V.,Hera’s; her can I scarce rule with words. Therefore I deem that by her
3405,BOOK V.,prompting thou art in this plight. Yet will I no longer endure to see
3406,BOOK V.,"thee in anguish; mine offspring art thou, and to me thy mother bare"
3407,BOOK V.,"thee. But wert thou born of any other god unto this violence, long ere"
3408,BOOK V.,this hadst thou been lower than the sons of Heaven.”*

3415,BOOK V.,So spake he and bade Paieon heal him. And Paieon laid assuaging drugs
3416,BOOK V.,upon the wound [and healed him; seeing he was verily of no mortal

3418,BOOK V.,"is liquid but curdleth speedily as a man stirreth, even so swiftly"
3419,BOOK V.,"healed he impetuous Ares. And Hebe bathed him, and clothed him in"
3420,BOOK V.,"gracious raiment, and he sate him down by Zeus son of Kronos, glorying"
3421,BOOK V.,in his might.
3422,BOOK V.,
3423,BOOK V.,"Then fared the twain back to the mansion of great Zeus, even Hera of"

3447,BOOK VI.,"drave into his forehead, so that the point of bronze pierced into the"
3448,BOOK VI.,bone; and darkness shrouded his eyes.
3449,BOOK VI.,
3450,BOOK VI.,Then Diomedes of the loud wrar-cry slew Axylos Teuthranos’ son that
3451,BOOK VI.,"dwelt in stablished Arisbe, a man of substance dear to his fellows; for"
3452,BOOK VI.,his dwelling was by the roadside and he entertained all men. Howbeit of
3453,BOOK VI.,all these was there then not one to meet the foe before his face and
3454,BOOK VI.,save him from fell destruction; but Diomedes took the life of both of
3455,BOOK VI.,"them, even of him and Kalesios his squire that now was the driver of"
3456,BOOK VI.,his chariot; so passed both below the earth.
3457,BOOK VI.,
3458,BOOK VI.,"And Euryalos slew Dresos and Opheltios, and followed after Aisepos and"
3459,BOOK VI.,Pedasos whom erst the fountain-nymph Abarbarea bare to noble Boukolion.
3460,BOOK VI.,"Now Boukolion was son of proud Laomedon, his eldest born, begotten of a"
3461,BOOK VI.,mother unwedded; and as he tended his flocks he had converse with the
3462,BOOK VI.,"nymph in love, and she conceived and bare twin sons. And lo, the"
3463,BOOK VI.,"strength of these and their glorious limbs Mekisteus’ son unstrung, and"
3464,BOOK VI.,stripped the armour from their shoulders. And stubborn Polypoites slew
3465,BOOK VI.,"Astyalos, and Odysseus with spear of bronze laid low Pidytes of"
3466,BOOK VI.,"Perkote, and so did Teukros to goodly Aretaon. Then was Ableros killed"
3467,BOOK VI.,"by the glistening spear of Antilochos, Nestor’s son, and Elatos by"
3468,BOOK VI.,Agamemnon king of men; beside the banks of fair-flowing Satnioeis dwelt
3469,BOOK VI.,"he in steep Pedasos. And Leïtos the warrior caught Phylakos, as he"
3470,BOOK VI.,fled; and Eurypylos slew Melanthios.
3471,BOOK VI.,
3472,BOOK VI.,Now did Menelaos of the loud war-cry take Adrestos alive; for his
3473,BOOK VI.,"horses took flight across the plain, and stumbling in a tamarisk bough"
3474,BOOK VI.,brake the curved car at the pole’s foot; so they themselves fared
3475,BOOK VI.,"towards the city where the rest were fleeing in rout, and their lord"
3476,BOOK VI.,"rolled from out the car beside the wheel, prone in the dust upon his"
3477,BOOK VI.,face. Then came Atreus’ son Menelaos to his side bearing his far-
3478,BOOK VI.,shadowing spear. Thereat Adrestos caught him by his knees and besought
3479,BOOK VI.,"him: “Take me captive, thou son of Atreus, and accept a worthy ransom;"
3480,BOOK VI.,"many a treasure is stored up in my father’s rich palace, bronze and"
3481,BOOK VI.,gold and smithied iron; thereof would my father yield thee ransom
3482,BOOK VI.,"beyond the telling, if he but heard that I am alive at the ships of the"
3483,BOOK VI.,Achaians.”
3484,BOOK VI.,
3485,BOOK VI.,"So spake he, and moved the spirit in his breast. And now had he"
3486,BOOK VI.,forthwith given him to his squire to lead him to the Achaians’ fleet
3487,BOOK VI.,"ships, but that Agamemnon came running to meet him, and spake a word of"
3488,BOOK VI.,"chiding to him: “Good Menelaos, why art thou so careful of the foemen?"
3489,BOOK VI.,Have then such good deeds been wrought thee in thy house by Trojans? Of
3490,BOOK VI.,"them let not one escape sheer destruction at our hands, not even the"
3491,BOOK VI.,"man-child that the mother beareth in her womb; let not even him escape,"
3492,BOOK VI.,"but all perish together out of Ilios, uncared for and unknown.”"
3493,BOOK VI.,
3494,BOOK VI.,So spake the hero and turned his brother’s mind with righteous
3495,BOOK VI.,"persuasion; so with his hand he thrust the hero Adrestos from him, and"
3496,BOOK VI.,"lord Agamemnon smote him in the flank, and he was overthrown, and"
3497,BOOK VI.,Atreus’ son set his heel upon his chest and plucked forth his ashen
3498,BOOK VI.,spear.
3499,BOOK VI.,
3500,BOOK VI.,"Then Nestor called to the Argives with far-reaching shout: “My friends,"
3501,BOOK VI.,"Danaan warriors, men of Ares’ company, let no man now take thought of"
3502,BOOK VI.,"spoils to tarry behind, that he may bring the greatest burden to the"
3503,BOOK VI.,ships; but let us slay the foemen. Thereafter shall ye at your ease
3504,BOOK VI.,also strip of their spoil the dead corpses about the plain.”
3505,BOOK VI.,
3506,BOOK VI.,So spake he and stirred the spirit and soul of every man. Now had the
3507,BOOK VI.,"Trojans been chased again by the Achaians, dear to Ares, up into Ilios,"
3508,BOOK VI.,"in their weakness overcome, but that Priam’s son Helenos, far best of"
3509,BOOK VI.,"augurs, stood by Aineias’ side and Hector’s, and spake to them:"
3510,BOOK VI.,"“Aineias and Hector, seeing that on you lieth the task of war in chief"
3511,BOOK VI.,"of Trojans and Lykians, because for every issue ye are foremost both"
3512,BOOK VI.,"for fight and counsel, stand ye your ground, and range the host"
3513,BOOK VI.,"everywhither to rally them before the gates, ere yet they fall fleeing"
3514,BOOK VI.,"in their women’s arms, and be made a rejoicing to the foe. Then when ye"
3515,BOOK VI.,have aroused all our battalions we will abide here and fight the
3516,BOOK VI.,"Danaans, though in sore weariness; for necessity presseth us hard: but"
3517,BOOK VI.,"thou, Hector, go into the city, and speak there to thy mother and mine;"
3518,BOOK VI.,let her gather the aged wives to bright-eyed Athene’s temple in the
3519,BOOK VI.,"upper city, and with her key open the doors of the holy house; and let"
3520,BOOK VI.,"her lay the robe, that seemeth to her the most gracious and greatest in"
3521,BOOK VI.,"her hall and far dearest unto herself, upon the knees of"
3522,BOOK VI.,beauteous-haired Athene; and vow to her to sacrifice in her temple
3523,BOOK VI.,"twelve sleek kine, that have not felt the goad, if she will have mercy"
3524,BOOK VI.,on the city and the Trojans’ wives and little children. So may she
3525,BOOK VI.,"perchance hold back Tydeus’ son from holy Ilios, the furious spearman,"
3526,BOOK VI.,"the mighty deviser of rout, whom in good sooth I deem to have proved"
3527,BOOK VI.,himself mightiest of the Achaians. Never in this wise feared we
3528,BOOK VI.,"Achilles, prince of men, who they say is born of a goddess; nay, but he"
3529,BOOK VI.,that we see is beyond measure furious; none can match him for might.”
3530,BOOK VI.,
3531,BOOK VI.,"So spake he, and Hector disregarded not his brother’s word, but leapt"
3532,BOOK VI.,"forthwith from his chariot in his armour to earth, and brandishing two"
3533,BOOK VI.,"sharp spears passed everywhere through the host, rousing them to"
3534,BOOK VI.,"battle, and stirred the dread war-cry. So they were rallied and stood"
3535,BOOK VI.,"to face the Achaians, and the Argives gave ground and ceased from"
3536,BOOK VI.,"slaughter, and deemed that some immortal had descended from starry"
3537,BOOK VI.,"heaven to bring the Trojans succour, in such wise rallied they. Then"
3538,BOOK VI.,Hector called to the Trojans with far-reaching shout: “O high-souled
3539,BOOK VI.,"Trojans and ye far-famed allies, quit you like men, my friends, and"
3540,BOOK VI.,"take thought of impetuous courage, while I depart to Ilios and bid the"
3541,BOOK VI.,elders of the council and our wives pray to the gods and vow them
3542,BOOK VI.,hecatombs.”
3543,BOOK VI.,
3544,BOOK VI.,"So saying Hector of the glancing helm departed, and the black hide beat"
3545,BOOK VI.,"on either side against his ankles and his neck, even the rim that ran"
3546,BOOK VI.,uttermost about his bossed shield.
3547,BOOK VI.,
3548,BOOK VI.,Now Glaukos son of Hippolochos and Tydeus’ son met in the mid-space of
3549,BOOK VI.,"the foes, eager to do battle. Thus when the twain were come nigh in"
3550,BOOK VI.,"onset on each other, to him first spake Diomedes of the loud war-cry:"
3551,BOOK VI.,"“Who art thou, noble sir, of mortal men? For never have I beheld thee"
3552,BOOK VI.,"in glorious battle ere this, yet now hast thou far outstripped all men"
3553,BOOK VI.,"in thy hardihood, seeing thou abidest my far-shadowing spear. Luckless"
3554,BOOK VI.,are the fathers whose children face my might. But if thou art some
3555,BOOK VI.,"immortal come down from heaven, then will not I fight with heavenly"
3556,BOOK VI.,gods. Nay moreover even Dryas’ son mighty Lykurgos was not for long
3557,BOOK VI.,"when he strove with heavenly gods, he that erst chased through the"
3558,BOOK VI.,goodly land of Nysa the nursing-mothers of frenzied Dionysos; and they
3559,BOOK VI.,"all cast their wands upon the ground, smitten with murderous Lykurgos’"
3560,BOOK VI.,"ox-goad. Then Dionysos fled and plunged beneath the salt sea-wave, and"
3561,BOOK VI.,"Thetis took him to her bosom, affrighted, for a mighty trembling had"
3562,BOOK VI.,seized him at his foe’s rebuke. But with Lykurgos the gods that live at
3563,BOOK VI.,"ease were wroth, and Kronos’ son made him blind, and he was not for"
3564,BOOK VI.,"long, because he was hated of all the immortal gods. So would neither I"
3565,BOOK VI.,be fain to fight the blessed gods. But if thou art of men that eat the
3566,BOOK VI.,"fruit of the field, come nigh, that anon thou mayest enter the toils of"
3567,BOOK VI.,destruction.”
3568,BOOK VI.,
3569,BOOK VI.,Then Hippolochos’ glorious son made answer to him: “Great-hearted
3570,BOOK VI.,"Tydeides, why enquirest thou of my generation? Even as are the"
3571,BOOK VI.,generations of leaves such are those likewise of men; the leaves that
3572,BOOK VI.,"be the wind scattereth on the earth, and the forest buddeth and putteth"
3573,BOOK VI.,"forth more again, when the season of spring is at hand; so of the"
3574,BOOK VI.,generations of men one putteth forth and another ceaseth. Yet if thou
3575,BOOK VI.,"wilt, have thine answer, that thou mayest well know our lineage,"
3576,BOOK VI.,whereof many men have knowledge. There is a city Ephyre in the heart of
3577,BOOK VI.,"Argos, pasture land of horses, and there dwelt Sisyphos that was"
3578,BOOK VI.,"craftiest of men, Sisyphos son of Aiolos; and he begat a son, even"
3579,BOOK VI.,"Glaukos, and Glaukos begat noble Bellerophon. To him the gods granted"
3580,BOOK VI.,beauty and lovely manhood; but Proitos in his heart devised ill for
3581,BOOK VI.,"him, and being mightier far drave him from the land of the Argives,"
3582,BOOK VI.,"whom Zeus had made subject to his sceptre.* Now Proitos’ wife, goodly"
3583,BOOK VI.,"Anteia, lusted after him, to have converse in secret love, but no whit"
3584,BOOK VI.,"prevailed she, for the uprightness of his heart, on wise Bellerophon."
3585,BOOK VI.,"Then spake she lyingly to king Proitos: “Die, Proitos, or else slay"
3586,BOOK VI.,"Bellerophon, that would have converse in love with me against my will.”"
3587,BOOK VI.,"So spake she, and anger gat hold upon the king at that he heard. To"
3588,BOOK VI.,"slay him he forbare, for his soul had shame of that; but he sent him to"
3589,BOOK VI.,"Lykia, and gave him tokens of woe, graving in a folded tablet many"
3590,BOOK VI.,"deadly things, and bade him shew these to Anteia’s father, that he"
3591,BOOK VI.,might be slain. So fared he to Lykia by the blameless convoy of the
3592,BOOK VI.,"gods. Now when he came to Lykia and the stream of Xanthos, then did the"
3593,BOOK VI.,king of wide Lykia honour him with all his heart; nine days he
3594,BOOK VI.,entertained him and killed nine oxen. And when on the tenth day
3595,BOOK VI.,"rosy-fingered dawn appeared, then he questioned him and asked to see"
3596,BOOK VI.,"what token he bare from his son-in-law, even Proitos. Now when he had"
3597,BOOK VI.,"received of him Proitos’ evil token, first he bade him slay Chimaira"
3598,BOOK VI.,"the unconquerable. Of divine birth was she and not of men, in front a"
3599,BOOK VI.,"lion, and behind a serpent, and in the midst a goat; and she breathed"
3600,BOOK VI.,"dread fierceness of blazing fire. And her he slew, obedient to the"
3601,BOOK VI.,"signs of heaven. Next fought he with the famed Solymi; this, said he,"
3602,BOOK VI.,was the mightiest battle of warriors wherein he entered. And thirdly he
3603,BOOK VI.,"slew the Amazons, women peers of men. And as he turned back therefrom,"
3604,BOOK VI.,the king devised another cunning wile; he picked from wide Lykia the
3605,BOOK VI.,"bravest men, and set an ambush. But these returned nowise home again;"
3606,BOOK VI.,for noble Bellerophon slew them all. So when the king now knew that he
3607,BOOK VI.,"was the brave offspring of a god, he kept him there, and plighted him"
3608,BOOK VI.,"his daughter, and gave him the half of all the honour of his kingdom;"
3609,BOOK VI.,"moreover the Lykians meted him a domain preeminent above all, fair with"
3610,BOOK VI.,vineyards and tilth to possess it.** And his wife bare wise Bellerophon
3611,BOOK VI.,"three children, Isandros and Hippolochos and Laodameia. With Laodameia"
3612,BOOK VI.,"lay Zeus the lord of counsel, and she bare godlike Sarpedon, the"
3613,BOOK VI.,warrior with arms of bronze. But when even Bellerophon came to be hated
3614,BOOK VI.,"of all the gods, then wandered he alone in the Aleian plain, devouring"
3615,BOOK VI.,"his own soul, and avoiding the paths of men; and Isandros his son was"
3616,BOOK VI.,"slain by Ares insatiate of battle, as he fought against the famed"
3617,BOOK VI.,"Solymi, and his daughter was slain in wrath of gold-gleaming***"
3618,BOOK VI.,"Artemis. But Hippolochos begat me, and of him do I declare me to be"
3619,BOOK VI.,sprung; he sent me to Troy and bade me very instantly to be ever the
3620,BOOK VI.,"best and to excel all other men, nor put to shame the lineage of my"
3621,BOOK VI.,fathers that were of noblest blood in Ephyre and in wide Lykia. This is
3622,BOOK VI.,the lineage and blood whereof I avow myself to be.”
3623,BOOK VI.,
3624,BOOK VI.,"* Or, “for Zeus had brought him [Bellerophon] under his sceptre’s"
3625,BOOK VI.,sway.”
3626,BOOK VI.,
3627,BOOK VI.,
3628,BOOK VI.,"** Or, if we read πυροφόροιο, “tilth of wheat-land.”"
3629,BOOK VI.,
3630,BOOK VI.,
3631,BOOK VI.,"*** Or, “Artemis of the golden reins.”"
3632,BOOK VI.,
3633,BOOK VI.,
3634,BOOK VI.,"So said he, and Diomedes of the loud war-cry was glad. He planted his"
3635,BOOK VI.,spear in the bounteous earth and with soft words spake to the shepherd
3636,BOOK VI.,of the host: “Surely then thou art to me a guest-friend of old times
3637,BOOK VI.,through my father: for goodly Oineus of yore entertained noble
3638,BOOK VI.,Bellerophon in his halls and kept him twenty days. Moreover they gave
3639,BOOK VI.,each the other goodly gifts of friendship; Oineus gave a belt bright
3640,BOOK VI.,"with purple, and Bellerophon a gold twy-handled cup, the which when I"
3641,BOOK VI.,"came I left in my palace. But of Tydeus I remember naught, seeing I was"
3642,BOOK VI.,"yet little when he left me, what time the Achaian host perished at"
3643,BOOK VI.,Thebes. Therefore now am I to thee a dear guest-friend in midmost
3644,BOOK VI.,"Argos, and thou in Lykia, whene’er I fare to your land. So let us shun"
3645,BOOK VI.,"each other’s spears, even amid the throng; Trojans are there in"
3646,BOOK VI.,"multitudes and famous allies for me to slay, whoe’er it be that God"
3647,BOOK VI.,vouchsafeth me and my feet overtake; and for thee are there Achaians in
3648,BOOK VI.,"multitude, to slay whome’er thou canst. But let us make exchange of"
3649,BOOK VI.,"arms between us, that these also may know how we avow ourselves to be"
3650,BOOK VI.,guest-friends by lineage.”
3651,BOOK VI.,
3652,BOOK VI.,"So spake the twain, and leaping from their cars clasped each the other"
3653,BOOK VI.,"by his hand, and pledged their faith. But now Zeus son of Kronos took"
3654,BOOK VI.,"from Glaukos his wits, in that he made exchange with Diomedes Tydeus’"
3655,BOOK VI.,"son of golden armour for bronze, the price of five score oxen for the"
3656,BOOK VI.,price of nine.
3657,BOOK VI.,
3658,BOOK VI.,"Now when Hector came to the Skaian gates and to the oak-tree, there"
3659,BOOK VI.,"came running round about him the Trojans’ wives and daughters,"
3660,BOOK VI.,enquiring of sons and brethren and friends and husbands. But he bade
3661,BOOK VI.,them thereat all in turn pray to the gods; but sorrow hung over many.
3662,BOOK VI.,
3663,BOOK VI.,"But when he came to Priam’s beautiful palace, adorned with polished"
3664,BOOK VI.,"colonnades—and in it were fifty chambers of polished stone, builded"
3665,BOOK VI.,"hard by one another, wherein Priam’s sons slept beside their wedded"
3666,BOOK VI.,wives; and for his daughters over against them on the other side within
3667,BOOK VI.,the courtyard were twelve roofed chambers of polished stone builded
3668,BOOK VI.,"hard by one another, wherein slept Priam’s sons-in-law beside their"
3669,BOOK VI.,"chaste wives—then came there to meet him his bountiful mother, leading"
3670,BOOK VI.,"with her Laodike, fairest of her daughters to look on; and she clasped"
3671,BOOK VI.,"her hand in his, and spake, and called upon his name: “My son, why hast"
3672,BOOK VI.,thou left violent battle to come hither? Surely the sons of the
3673,BOOK VI.,"Achaians—name of evil!—press thee hard in fight about thy city, and so"
3674,BOOK VI.,"thy spirit hath brought thee hither, to come and stretch forth thy"
3675,BOOK VI.,hands to Zeus from the citadel. But tarry till I bring thee honey-sweet
3676,BOOK VI.,"wine, that thou mayest pour libation to Zeus and all the immortals"
3677,BOOK VI.,"first, and then shalt thou thyself also be refreshed if thou wilt"
3678,BOOK VI.,"drink. When a man is awearied wine greatly maketh his strength to wax,"
3679,BOOK VI.,even as thou art awearied in fighting for thy fellows.”
3680,BOOK VI.,
3681,BOOK VI.,Then great Hector of the glancing helm answered her: “Bring me no
3682,BOOK VI.,"honey-hearted wine, my lady mother, lest thou cripple me of my courage"
3683,BOOK VI.,and I be forgetful of my might.* Moreover I have awe to make libation
3684,BOOK VI.,of gleaming wine to Zeus with hands unwashen; nor can it be in any wise
3685,BOOK VI.,"that one should pray to the son of Kronos, god of storm-cloud, all"
3686,BOOK VI.,"defiled with blood and filth. But go thou to the temple of Athene,"
3687,BOOK VI.,"driver of the spoil, with offerings, and gather the aged wives"
3688,BOOK VI.,together; and the robe that seemeth to thee the most gracious and
3689,BOOK VI.,"greatest in thy palace, and dearest unto thyself, that lay thou upon"
3690,BOOK VI.,"the knees of beauteous-haired Athene, and vow to her to sacrifice in"
3691,BOOK VI.,"her temple twelve sleek kine, that have not felt the goad, if she will"
3692,BOOK VI.,have mercy on the city and the Trojans’ wives and little children. So
3693,BOOK VI.,"may she perchance hold back Tydeus’ son from holy Ilios, the furious"
3694,BOOK VI.,"spearman, the mighty deviser of rout. So go thou to the temple of"
3695,BOOK VI.,"Athene, driver of the spoil; and I will go after Paris, to summon him,"
3696,BOOK VI.,if perchance he will hearken to my voice. Would that the earth
3697,BOOK VI.,forthwith might swallow him up! The Olympian fostered him to be a sore
3698,BOOK VI.,"bane to the Trojans and to great-hearted Priam, and to Priam’s sons. If"
3699,BOOK VI.,"I but saw him going down to the gates of death, then might I deem that"
3700,BOOK VI.,my heart had forgotten its sorrow.”**

3707,BOOK VI.,
3708,BOOK VI.,
3709,BOOK VI.,"So said he, and she went unto the hall, and called to her handmaidens,"
3710,BOOK VI.,and they gathered the aged wives throughout the city. Then she herself
3711,BOOK VI.,"went down to her fragrant chamber where were her embroidered robes, the"
3712,BOOK VI.,"work of Sidonian women, whom godlike Alexandros himself brought from"
3713,BOOK VI.,"Sidon, when he sailed over the wide sea, that journey wherein he"
3714,BOOK VI.,brought home high-born Helen. Of these Hekabe took one to bear for an
3715,BOOK VI.,"offering to Athene, the one that was fairest for adornment and"
3716,BOOK VI.,"greatest, and shone like a star, and lay nethermost of all. Then went"
3717,BOOK VI.,she her way and the multitude of aged wives hasted after her.
3718,BOOK VI.,
3719,BOOK VI.,"Now when they came to the temple of Athene in the citadel, fair-cheeked"
3720,BOOK VI.,"Theano opened them the doors, even Kisseus’ daughter, wife of"
3721,BOOK VI.,horse-taming Antenor; for her the Trojans had made priestess of Athene.
3722,BOOK VI.,Then lifted they all their hands to Athene with lamentation: and
3723,BOOK VI.,fair-cheeked Theano took the robe and laid it on the knees of
3724,BOOK VI.,"beauteous-haired Athene, and lifted up her voice and prayed to the"
3725,BOOK VI.,"daughter of great Zeus: “Lady Athene, saviour of the city, fair among"
3726,BOOK VI.,"goddesses, break now Diomedes’ spear, and grant moreover that himself"
3727,BOOK VI.,may fall prone before the Skaian gates; that we may sacrifice thee now
3728,BOOK VI.,"forthwith in thy temple twelve sleek kine, that have not felt the goad,"
3729,BOOK VI.,if thou wilt have mercy on the city and the Trojans’ wives and little
3730,BOOK VI.,"children.” So spake she praying, but Pallas Athene denied the prayer."
3731,BOOK VI.,
3732,BOOK VI.,So were these praying to the daughter of great Zeus; and Hector was
3733,BOOK VI.,"come to Alexandros’ fair palace, that himself had builded with them"
3734,BOOK VI.,that were most excellent carpenters then in deep-soiled Troy-land;
3735,BOOK VI.,these made him his chamber and hall and courtyard hard by to Priam and
3736,BOOK VI.,"Hector, in the upper city. There entered in Hector dear to Zeus, and"
3737,BOOK VI.,"his hand bare his spear, eleven cubits long: before his face glittered"
3738,BOOK VI.,"the bronze spear-point, and a ring of gold ran round about it. And he"
3739,BOOK VI.,"found Paris in his chamber busied with his beauteous arms, his shield"
3740,BOOK VI.,"and breastplate, and handling his curved bow; and Helen of Argos sate"
3741,BOOK VI.,among her serving-women and appointed brave handiwork for her
3742,BOOK VI.,handmaidens. Then when Hector saw him he rebuked him with scornful
3743,BOOK VI.,"words: “Good sir, thou dost not well to cherish this rancour in thy"
3744,BOOK VI.,"heart. The folk are perishing about the city and high wall in battle,"
3745,BOOK VI.,and for thy sake the battle-cry is kindled and war around this city;
3746,BOOK VI.,"yea thyself wouldest thou fall out with another, didst thou see him"
3747,BOOK VI.,"shrinking from hateful war. Up then, lest the city soon be scorched"
3748,BOOK VI.,with burning fire.”
3749,BOOK VI.,
3750,BOOK VI.,"And godlike Alexandros answered him: “Hector, since in measure thou"
3751,BOOK VI.,"chidest me and not beyond measure, therefore will I tell thee; lay thou"
3752,BOOK VI.,it to thine heart and hearken to me. Not by reason so much of the
3753,BOOK VI.,"Trojans, for wrath and indignation, sate I me in my chamber, but fain"
3754,BOOK VI.,would I yield me to my sorrow. Even now my wife hath persuaded me with
3755,BOOK VI.,"soft words, and urged me into battle; and I moreover, even I, deem that"
3756,BOOK VI.,"it will be better so; for victory shifteth from man to man. Go to then,"
3757,BOOK VI.,"tarry awhile, let me put on my armour of war; or else fare thou forth,"
3758,BOOK VI.,and I will follow; and I think to overtake thee.”
3759,BOOK VI.,
3760,BOOK VI.,"So said he, but Hector of the glancing helm answered him not a word."
3761,BOOK VI.,"But Helen spake to him with gentle words: “My brother, even mine that"
3762,BOOK VI.,"am a dog, mischievous and abominable, would that on the day when my"
3763,BOOK VI.,"mother bare me at the first, an evil storm-wind had caught me away to a"
3764,BOOK VI.,"mountain or a billow of the loud-sounding sea, where the billow might"
3765,BOOK VI.,"have swept me away before all these things came to pass. Howbeit,"
3766,BOOK VI.,"seeing the gods devised all these ills in this wise, would that then I"
3767,BOOK VI.,"had been mated with a better man, that felt dishonour and the multitude"
3768,BOOK VI.,"of men’s reproachings. But as for him, neither hath he now sound heart,"
3769,BOOK VI.,nor ever will have; thereof deem I moreover that he will reap the
3770,BOOK VI.,"fruit. But now come, enter in and sit thee here upon this bench, my"
3771,BOOK VI.,"brother, since thy heart chiefly trouble hath encompassed, for the sake"
3772,BOOK VI.,"of me, that am a dog, and for Alexandros’ sin; on whom Zeus bringeth"
3773,BOOK VI.,"evil doom, that even in days to come we may be a song in the ears of"
3774,BOOK VI.,men that shall be hereafter.”
3775,BOOK VI.,
3776,BOOK VI.,"Then great Hector of the glancing helm answered her: “Bid me not sit,"
3777,BOOK VI.,"Helen, of thy love; thou wilt not persuade me. Already my heart is set"
3778,BOOK VI.,"to succour the men of Troy, that have great desire for me that am not"
3779,BOOK VI.,"with them. But rouse thou this fellow, yea let himself make speed, to"
3780,BOOK VI.,overtake me yet within the city. For I shall go into mine house to
3781,BOOK VI.,"behold my housefolk and my dear wife, and infant boy; for I know not if"
3782,BOOK VI.,"I shall return home to them again, or if the gods will now overthrow me"
3783,BOOK VI.,at the hands of the Achaians.”
3784,BOOK VI.,
3785,BOOK VI.,So spake Hector of the glancing helm and departed; and anon he came to
3786,BOOK VI.,his well stablished house. But he found not white-armed Andromache in
3787,BOOK VI.,the halls; she with her boy and fair-robed handmaiden had taken her
3788,BOOK VI.,"stand upon the tower, weeping and wailing. And when Hector found not"
3789,BOOK VI.,"his noble wife within, he came and stood upon the threshold and spake"
3790,BOOK VI.,"amid the serving women: “Come tell me now true, my serving women."
3791,BOOK VI.,Whither went white-armed Andromache forth from the hall? Hath she gone
3792,BOOK VI.,"out to my sisters or unto my brothers’ fair-robed wives, or to Athene’s"
3793,BOOK VI.,"temple, where all the fair-tressed Trojan women propitiate the awful"
3794,BOOK VI.,goddess?”
3795,BOOK VI.,
3796,BOOK VI.,"Then a busy housedame spake in answer to him: “Hector, seeing thou"
3797,BOOK VI.,"straitly chargest us tell thee true, neither hath she gone out to any"
3798,BOOK VI.,"of thy sisters or thy brothers’ fair-robed wives, neither to Athene’s"
3799,BOOK VI.,"temple, where all the fair-tressed Trojan women are propitiating the"
3800,BOOK VI.,"awful goddess; but she went to the great tower of Ilios, because she"
3801,BOOK VI.,"heard the Trojans were hard pressed, and great victory was for the"
3802,BOOK VI.,"Achaians. So hath she come in haste to the wall, like unto one"
3803,BOOK VI.,frenzied; and the nurse with her beareth the child.”
3804,BOOK VI.,
3805,BOOK VI.,"So spake the housedame, and Hector hastened from his house back by the"
3806,BOOK VI.,same way down the well-builded streets. When he had passed through the
3807,BOOK VI.,"great city and was come to the Skaian gates, whereby he was minded to"
3808,BOOK VI.,"issue upon the plain, then came his dear-won* wife, running to meet"
3809,BOOK VI.,"him, even Andromache daughter of great-hearted Eëtion, Eëtion that"
3810,BOOK VI.,"dwelt beneath wooded Plakos, in Thebe under Plakos, and was king of the"
3811,BOOK VI.,men of Kilikia; for his daughter was wife to bronze-harnessed Hector.
3812,BOOK VI.,"So she met him now, and with her went the handmaid bearing in her bosom"
3813,BOOK VI.,"the tender boy, the little child, Hector’s loved son, like unto a"
3814,BOOK VI.,"beautiful star. Him Hector called Skamandrios, but all the folk"
3815,BOOK VI.,Astyanax; for only Hector guarded Ilios.** So now he smiled and gazed
3816,BOOK VI.,"at his boy silently, and Andromache stood by his side weeping, and"
3817,BOOK VI.,"clasped her hand in his, and spake and called upon his name. “Dear my"
3818,BOOK VI.,"lord, this thy hardihood will undo thee, neither hast thou any pity for"
3819,BOOK VI.,"thine infant boy, nor for me forlorn that soon shall be thy widow; for"
3820,BOOK VI.,soon will the Achaians all set upon thee and slay thee. But it were
3821,BOOK VI.,better for me to go down to the grave if I lose thee; for never more
3822,BOOK VI.,"will any comfort be mine, when once thou, even thou, hast met thy fate,"
3823,BOOK VI.,but only sorrow. Moreover I have no father nor lady mother: my father
3824,BOOK VI.,"was slain of goodly Achilles, for he wasted the populous city of the"
3825,BOOK VI.,"Kilikians, even high-gated Thebe, and slew Eëtion; yet he despoiled him"
3826,BOOK VI.,"not, for his soul had shame of that, but he burnt him in his inlaid"
3827,BOOK VI.,armour and raised a barrow over him; and all about were elm-trees
3828,BOOK VI.,"planted by the mountain nymphs, daughters of aegis-bearing Zeus. And"
3829,BOOK VI.,"the seven brothers that were mine within our halls, all these on the"
3830,BOOK VI.,selfsame day went within the house of Hades; for fleet-footed goodly
3831,BOOK VI.,Achilles slew them all amid their kine of trailing gait and
3832,BOOK VI.,"white-fleeced sheep. And my mother, that was queen beneath wooded"
3833,BOOK VI.,"Plakos, her brought he hither with the other spoils, but afterward took"
3834,BOOK VI.,a ransom untold to set her free; but in her father’s halls was she
3835,BOOK VI.,"smitten by the Archer Artemis. Nay, Hector, thou art to me father and"
3836,BOOK VI.,"lady mother, yea and brother, even as thou art my goodly husband. Come"
3837,BOOK VI.,"now, have pity and abide here upon the tower, lest thou make thy child"
3838,BOOK VI.,"an orphan and thy wife a widow. And stay thy folk beside the fig-tree,"
3839,BOOK VI.,where best the city may be scaled and the wall is assailable. Thrice
3840,BOOK VI.,came thither the most valiant that are with the two Aiantes and famed
3841,BOOK VI.,"Idomeneus and the sons of Atreus and Tydeus’ valiant son, and essayed"
3842,BOOK VI.,"to enter; whether one skilled in soothsaying revealed it to them, or"
3843,BOOK VI.,whether their own spirit urgeth and biddeth them on.”
3844,BOOK VI.,
3845,BOOK VI.,"* Or, “bounteous.”"
3846,BOOK VI.,
3847,BOOK VI.,
3848,BOOK VI.,** Astyanax = “City King.”
3849,BOOK VI.,
3850,BOOK VI.,
3851,BOOK VI.,Then great Hector of the glancing helm answered her: “Surely I take
3852,BOOK VI.,"thought for all these things, my wife; but I have very sore shame of"
3853,BOOK VI.,"the Trojans and Trojan dames with trailing robes, if like a coward I"
3854,BOOK VI.,"shrink away from battle. Moreover mine own soul forbiddeth me, seeing I"
3855,BOOK VI.,have learnt ever to be valiant and fight in the forefront of the
3856,BOOK VI.,"Trojans, winning my father’s great glory and mine own. Yea of a surety"
3857,BOOK VI.,I know this in heart and soul; the day shall come for holy Ilios to be
3858,BOOK VI.,"laid low, and Priam and the folk of Priam of the good ashen spear. Yet"
3859,BOOK VI.,"doth the anguish of the Trojans hereafter not so much trouble me,"
3860,BOOK VI.,"neither Hekabe’s own, neither king Priam’s, neither my brethren’s, the"
3861,BOOK VI.,"many and brave that shall fall in the dust before their foemen, as doth"
3862,BOOK VI.,thine anguish in the day when some mail-clad Achaian shall lead thee
3863,BOOK VI.,weeping and rob thee of the light of freedom. So shalt thou abide in
3864,BOOK VI.,"Argos and ply the loom at another woman’s bidding, and bear water from"
3865,BOOK VI.,"fount Messeis or Hypereia, being grievously entreated, and sore"
3866,BOOK VI.,constraint shall be laid upon thee. And then shall one say that
3867,BOOK VI.,"beholdeth thee weep: ‘This is the wife of Hector, that was foremost in"
3868,BOOK VI.,battle of the horse-taming Trojans when men fought about Ilios.’ Thus
3869,BOOK VI.,"shall one say hereafter, and fresh grief will be thine for lack of such"
3870,BOOK VI.,an husband as thou hadst to ward off the day of thraldom. But me in
3871,BOOK VI.,"death may the heaped-up earth be covering, ere I hear thy crying and"
3872,BOOK VI.,thy carrying into captivity.”
3873,BOOK VI.,
3874,BOOK VI.,"So spake glorious Hector, and stretched out his arm to his boy. But the"
3875,BOOK VI.,"child shrunk crying to the bosom of his fair-girdled nurse, dismayed at"
3876,BOOK VI.,"his dear father’s aspect, and in dread at the bronze and horse-hair"
3877,BOOK VI.,crest that he beheld nodding fiercely from the helmet’s top. Then his
3878,BOOK VI.,"dear father laughed aloud, and his lady mother; forthwith glorious"
3879,BOOK VI.,"Hector took the helmet from his head, and laid it, all gleaming, upon"
3880,BOOK VI.,"the earth; then kissed he his dear son and dandled him in his arms, and"
3881,BOOK VI.,"spake in prayer to Zeus and all the gods, “O Zeus and all ye gods,"
3882,BOOK VI.,"vouchsafe ye that this my son may likewise prove even as I, pre-eminent"
3883,BOOK VI.,"amid the Trojans, and as valiant in might, and be a great king of"
3884,BOOK VI.,"Ilios. Then may men say of him, ‘Far greater is he than his father’ as"
3885,BOOK VI.,he returneth home from battle; and may he bring with him blood-stained
3886,BOOK VI.,"spoils from the foeman he hath slain, and may his mother’s heart be"
3887,BOOK VI.,glad.”
3888,BOOK VI.,
3889,BOOK VI.,"So spake he, and laid his son in his dear wife’s arms; and she took him"
3890,BOOK VI.,"to her fragrant bosom, smiling tearfully. And her husband had pity to"
3891,BOOK VI.,"see her, and caressed her with his hand, and spake and called upon her"
3892,BOOK VI.,"name: “Dear one, I pray thee be not of oversorrowful heart; no man"
3893,BOOK VI.,"against my fate shall hurl me to Hades; only destiny, I ween, no man"
3894,BOOK VI.,"hath escaped, be he coward or be he valiant, when once he hath been"
3895,BOOK VI.,"born. But go thou to thine house and see to thine own tasks, the loom"
3896,BOOK VI.,"and distaff, and bid thine handmaidens ply their work; but for war"
3897,BOOK VI.,"shall men provide, and I in chief of all men that dwell in Ilios.”"
3898,BOOK VI.,
3899,BOOK VI.,"So spake glorious Hector, and took up his horse-hair crested helmet;"
3900,BOOK VI.,"and his dear wife departed to her home, oft looking back, and letting"
3901,BOOK VI.,fall big tears. Anon she came to the well-stablished house of
3902,BOOK VI.,"man-slaying Hector, and found therein her many handmaidens, and stirred"
3903,BOOK VI.,"lamentation in them all. So bewailed they Hector, while yet he lived,"
3904,BOOK VI.,within his house: for they deemed that he would no more come back to
3905,BOOK VI.,"them from battle, nor escape the fury of the hands of the Achaians."
3906,BOOK VI.,
3907,BOOK VI.,"Neither lingered Paris long in his lofty house, but clothed on him his"
3908,BOOK VI.,"brave armour, bedight with bronze, and hasted through the city,"
3909,BOOK VI.,"trusting to his nimble feet. Even as when a stalled horse, full-fed at"
3910,BOOK VI.,"the manger, breaketh his tether and speedeth at the gallop across the"
3911,BOOK VI.,"plain, being wont to bathe him in the fair-flowing stream, exultingly;"
3912,BOOK VI.,"and holdeth his head on high, and his mane floateth about his"
3913,BOOK VI.,"shoulders, and he trusteth in his glory, and nimbly his limbs bear him"
3914,BOOK VI.,"to the haunts and pasturages of mares; even so Priam’s son Paris,"
3915,BOOK VI.,"glittering in his armour like the shining sun, strode down from high"
3916,BOOK VI.,"Pergamos laughingly, and his swift feet bare him. Forthwith he overtook"
3917,BOOK VI.,"his brother noble Hector, even as he was on the point to turn him away"
3918,BOOK VI.,from the spot where he had dallied with his wife. To him first spake
3919,BOOK VI.,"godlike Alexandros: “Sir, in good sooth I have delayed thee in thine"
3920,BOOK VI.,"haste by my tarrying, and came not rightly as thou badest me.”"
3921,BOOK VI.,
3922,BOOK VI.,"And Hector of the glancing helm answered him and said: “Good brother,"
3923,BOOK VI.,"no man that is rightminded could make light of thy doings in fight,"
3924,BOOK VI.,seeing thou art strong: but thou art wilfully remiss and hast no care;
3925,BOOK VI.,"and for this my heart is grieved within me, that I hear shameful words"
3926,BOOK VI.,"concerning thee in the Trojans’ mouths, who for thy sake endure much"
3927,BOOK VI.,"toil. But let us be going; all this will we make good hereafter, if"
3928,BOOK VI.,Zeus ever vouchsafe us to set before the heavenly gods that are for
3929,BOOK VI.,"everlasting the cup of deliverance in our halls, when we have chased"
3930,BOOK VI.,out of Troy-land the well-greaved Achaians.”
3931,BOOK VI.,
3932,BOOK VI.,
3933,BOOK VI.,
3934,BOOK VI.,
3935,BOOK VII.,BOOK VII.
3936,BOOK VII.,
3937,BOOK VII.,
3938,BOOK VII.,"Of the single combat between Aias and Hector, and of the burying of the"
3939,BOOK VII.,"dead, and the building of a wall about the Achaian ships."
3940,BOOK VII.,
3941,BOOK VII.,
3942,BOOK VII.,"So spake glorious Hector and issued from the gates, and with him went"
3943,BOOK VII.,his brother Alexandros; and both were eager of soul for fight and
3944,BOOK VII.,battle. Even as God giveth to longing seamen fair wind when they have
3945,BOOK VII.,"grown weary of beating the main with polished oars, and their limbs are"
3946,BOOK VII.,"fordone with toil, even so appeared these to the longing Trojans."
3947,BOOK VII.,
3948,BOOK VII.,"Then the one of them slew king Areïthoös’ son, Menesthios dwelling in"
3949,BOOK VII.,"Arne, whom Areïthoös the Mace-man and ox-eyed Phylomedusa begat; and"
3950,BOOK VII.,"the other, even Hector, with his sharp spear smote Eïoneus’ neck"
3951,BOOK VII.,"beneath his bronze helmet-rim, and unstrung his limbs. And Glaukos son"
3952,BOOK VII.,"of Hippolochos, captain of the men of Lykia, cast his spear at Iphinoos"
3953,BOOK VII.,"through the press of battle, even at the son of Dexios, as he sprang up"
3954,BOOK VII.,"behind his fleet mares, and smote his shoulder; so fell he from his"
3955,BOOK VII.,chariot to earth and his limbs were unstrung.
3956,BOOK VII.,
3957,BOOK VII.,Now when the goddess bright-eyed Athene marked them making havoc of the
3958,BOOK VII.,"Argives in the press of battle, she darted down from the crests of"
3959,BOOK VII.,"Olympus to holy Ilios. But Apollo rose to meet her, for he beheld her"
3960,BOOK VII.,"from Pergamos, and would have victory for the Trojans. So the twain met"
3961,BOOK VII.,each the other by the oak-tree. To her spake first king Apollo son of
3962,BOOK VII.,"Zeus: “Why now art thou come thus eagerly from Olympus, thou daughter"
3963,BOOK VII.,"of great Zeus, and why hath thy high heart sent thee? Surely it is to"
3964,BOOK VII.,give the Danaans unequal victory in battle! seeing thou hast no mercy
3965,BOOK VII.,"on the Trojans, that perish. But if thou wouldest hearken to me—and it"
3966,BOOK VII.,were far better so—let us now stay battle and warring for the day;
3967,BOOK VII.,"hereafter shall they fight again, till they reach the goal of Ilios,"
3968,BOOK VII.,"since thus it seemeth good to your hearts, goddesses immortal, to lay"
3969,BOOK VII.,waste this city.”
3970,BOOK VII.,
3971,BOOK VII.,"And the goddess bright-eyed Athene made answer to him: “So be it,"
3972,BOOK VII.,Far-darter; in this mind I likewise came from Olympus to the midst of
3973,BOOK VII.,"Trojans and Achaians. But come, how thinkest thou to stay the battle of"
3974,BOOK VII.,the warriors?”
3975,BOOK VII.,
3976,BOOK VII.,"And king Apollo, son of Zeus, made answer to her: “Let us arouse the"
3977,BOOK VII.,"stalwart spirit of horse-taming Hector, if so be he will challenge some"
3978,BOOK VII.,one of the Danaans in single fight man to man to meet him in deadly
3979,BOOK VII.,combat. So shall the bronze-greaved Achaians be jealous and stir up one
3980,BOOK VII.,to fight singly with goodly Hector.”
3981,BOOK VII.,
3982,BOOK VII.,So spake he and the bright-eyed goddess Athene disregarded not. Now
3983,BOOK VII.,Helenos Priam’s dear son understood in spirit their resolve that the
3984,BOOK VII.,gods in counsel had approved; and he went to Hector and stood beside
3985,BOOK VII.,"him, and spake a word to him: “Hector son of Priam, peer of Zeus in"
3986,BOOK VII.,"counsel, wouldest thou now hearken at all to me? for I am thy brother."
3987,BOOK VII.,"Make the other Trojans sit, and all the Achaians, and thyself challenge"
3988,BOOK VII.,him that is best of the Achaians to meet thee man to man in deadly
3989,BOOK VII.,combat. It is not yet thy destiny to die and meet thy doom; for thus
3990,BOOK VII.,heard I the voice of the gods that are from everlasting.”
3991,BOOK VII.,
3992,BOOK VII.,"So said he, and Hector rejoiced greatly to hear his saying, and went"
3993,BOOK VII.,into the midst and refrained the battalions of the Trojans with his
3994,BOOK VII.,spear grasped by the middle; and they all sate them down: and Agamemnon
3995,BOOK VII.,made the well-greaved Achaians sit. And Athene withal and Apollo of the
3996,BOOK VII.,"silver bow, in the likeness of vulture birds, sate them upon a tall oak"
3997,BOOK VII.,"holy to aegis-bearing father Zeus, rejoicing in their warriors; and the"
3998,BOOK VII.,"ranks of all of them sate close together, bristling with shields and"
3999,BOOK VII.,plumes and spears. Even as there spreadeth across the main the ripple
4000,BOOK VII.,"of the west wind newly risen, and the sea grows black beneath it, so"
4001,BOOK VII.,sate the ranks of Achaians and Trojans upon the plain. And Hector spake
4002,BOOK VII.,"between both hosts: “Hearken to me, Trojans and well-greaved Achaians,"
4003,BOOK VII.,that I may speak what my mind within my breast biddeth me. Our oaths of
4004,BOOK VII.,"truce Kronos’ son, enthroned on high, accomplished not; but evil is his"
4005,BOOK VII.,"intent and ordinance for both our hosts, until either ye take"
4006,BOOK VII.,fair-towered Troy or yourselves be vanquished beside your seafaring
4007,BOOK VII.,ships. But in the midst of you are the chiefest of all the Achaians;
4008,BOOK VII.,therefore now let the man whose heart biddeth him fight with me come
4009,BOOK VII.,hither from among you all to be your champion against goodly Hector.
4010,BOOK VII.,"And this declare I, and be Zeus our witness thereto; if that man slay"
4011,BOOK VII.,"me with the long-edged sword, let him spoil me of my armour and bear it"
4012,BOOK VII.,"to the hollow ships, but give back my body to my home, that Trojans and"
4013,BOOK VII.,Trojans’ wives may give me my due of burning in my death. But if I slay
4014,BOOK VII.,"him and Apollo vouchsafe me glory, I will spoil him of his armour and"
4015,BOOK VII.,bear it to holy Ilios and hang it upon the temple of far-darting
4016,BOOK VII.,"Apollo, but his corpse will I render back to the well-decked ships,"
4017,BOOK VII.,"that the flowing-haired Achaians may entomb him, and build him a barrow"
4018,BOOK VII.,"beside wide Hellespont. So shall one say even of men that be late born,"
4019,BOOK VII.,as he saileth in his benched ship over the wine-dark sea: ‘This is the
4020,BOOK VII.,"barrow of a man that died in days of old, a champion whom glorious"
4021,BOOK VII.,"Hector slew.’ So shall a man say hereafter, and this my glory shall"
4022,BOOK VII.,never die.”
4023,BOOK VII.,
4024,BOOK VII.,So spake he and they all were silent and held their peace; to deny him
4025,BOOK VII.,"they were ashamed, and feared to meet him. But at the last stood up"
4026,BOOK VII.,"Menelaos and spake amid them and chiding upbraided them, and groaned"
4027,BOOK VII.,"deep at heart: “Ah me, vain threateners, ye women of Achaia and no more"
4028,BOOK VII.,"men, surely all this shall be a shame, evil of evil, if no one of the"
4029,BOOK VII.,"Danaans now goeth to meet Hector. Nay, turn ye all to earth and water,"
4030,BOOK VII.,"sitting there each man disheartened, helplessly inglorious; against him"
4031,BOOK VII.,will I myself array me; and from on high the threads of victory are
4032,BOOK VII.,guided of the immortal gods.”
4033,BOOK VII.,
4034,BOOK VII.,"So spake he and donned his fair armour. And now, O Menelaos, had the"
4035,BOOK VII.,"end of life appeared for thee at Hector’s hands, seeing he was stronger"
4036,BOOK VII.,"far, but that the princes of the Achaians started up and caught thee."
4037,BOOK VII.,"And Atreus’ son himself, wide-ruling Agamemnon, took him by his right"
4038,BOOK VII.,"hand and spake a word and called upon his name: “Thou doest madly,"
4039,BOOK VII.,Menelaos fosterling of Zeus; yet is it no time for this thy madness.
4040,BOOK VII.,"Draw back, though it be with pain, nor think for contention’s sake to"
4041,BOOK VII.,"fight with one better than thou, with Hector Priam’s son, whom others"
4042,BOOK VII.,"beside thee abhor. Yea, this man even Achilles dreadeth to meet in"
4043,BOOK VII.,"battle, wherein is the warrior’s glory; and Achilles is better far than"
4044,BOOK VII.,thou. Go therefore now and sit amid the company of thy fellows; against
4045,BOOK VII.,him shall the Achaians put forth another champion. Fearless though he
4046,BOOK VII.,"be and insatiate of turmoil, I ween that he shall be fain to rest his"
4047,BOOK VII.,"knees, if he escape from the fury of war and terrible fray.”"
4048,BOOK VII.,
4049,BOOK VII.,So spake the hero and persuaded his brother’s heart with just counsel;
4050,BOOK VII.,and he obeyed. So his squires thereat with gladness took his armour
4051,BOOK VII.,from his shoulders; and Nestor stood up and spake amid the Argives:
4052,BOOK VII.,"“Fie upon it, verily sore lamentation cometh on the land of Achaia."
4053,BOOK VII.,"Verily old Peleus driver of chariots would groan sore, that goodly"
4054,BOOK VII.,"counsellor of the Myrmidons and orator, who erst questioned me in his"
4055,BOOK VII.,"house, and rejoiced greatly, inquiring of the lineage and birth of all"
4056,BOOK VII.,the Argives. If he heard now of those that all were cowering before
4057,BOOK VII.,"Hector, then would he lift his hands to the immortals, instantly"
4058,BOOK VII.,praying that his soul might depart from his limbs down to the house of
4059,BOOK VII.,Hades. Ah would to father Zeus and Athene and Apollo I were young as
4060,BOOK VII.,when beside swift-flowing Keladon the Pylians gathered together to
4061,BOOK VII.,"battle and the Arkadians that bear the spear, beneath the walls of"
4062,BOOK VII.,"Pheia, about the streams of Iardanos. Then stood up for their champion"
4063,BOOK VII.,"Ereuthalion, a man the peer of gods, bearing upon his shoulders the"
4064,BOOK VII.,"armour of king Areïthoös, goodly Areïthoös that by men and fair-girdled"
4065,BOOK VII.,"women was surnamed the Mace-man, because he fought not with bow and"
4066,BOOK VII.,"long spear, but with an iron mace clave the battalions. Him Lykurgos"
4067,BOOK VII.,"slew by guile, and not by strength, in a narrow way, where his mace of"
4068,BOOK VII.,"iron saved him not from destruction: ere that, Lykurgos came on him"
4069,BOOK VII.,"unawares and pierced him through the midst with his dart, and he was"
4070,BOOK VII.,hurled backward upon the earth. Then Lykurgos despoiled him of his arms
4071,BOOK VII.,that brazen Ares had given him; and these himself he bare thereafter
4072,BOOK VII.,into the mellay of war. But when Lykurgos grew old within his halls he
4073,BOOK VII.,gave them to Ereuthalion his dear squire to wear. So with his arms upon
4074,BOOK VII.,"him he challenged all our best; but they trembled sore and were afraid,"
4075,BOOK VII.,and no man took heart. But me my hardy spirit aroused to meet him in my
4076,BOOK VII.,confidence;* yet was I youngest in years of all. So fought I with him
4077,BOOK VII.,and Athene vouchsafed me glory. Tallest was he and strongest of men
4078,BOOK VII.,that I have slain; as one of huge bulk he lay spread this way and that.
4079,BOOK VII.,Would to God I were thus young and my strength were sound; then would
4080,BOOK VII.,Hector of the glancing helm soon find his combat. But of those of you
4081,BOOK VII.,"that be chieftains of the host of the Achaians, yet desireth no man of"
4082,BOOK VII.,good heart to meet Hector face to face.”
4083,BOOK VII.,
4084,BOOK VII.,"* Or, “to meet his might,” according to the usual interpretation of ᾦ."
4085,BOOK VII.,
4086,BOOK VII.,
4087,BOOK VII.,"So the old man upbraided them, and there stood up nine in all. Far"
4088,BOOK VII.,"first arose Agamemnon king of men, and after him rose Tydeus’ son"
4089,BOOK VII.,"stalwart Diomedes, and after them the Aiantes clothed with impetuous"
4090,BOOK VII.,"might, and after them Idomeneus and Idomeneus’ brother-in-arms"
4091,BOOK VII.,"Meriones, peer of Enyalios slayer of men, and after them Eurypylos"
4092,BOOK VII.,Euaimon’s glorious son; and up rose Thoas Andraimon’s son and goodly
4093,BOOK VII.,Odysseus. So all these were fain to fight with goodly Hector. And among
4094,BOOK VII.,them spake again knightly Nestor of Gerenia: “Now cast ye the lot from
4095,BOOK VII.,"the first unto the last, for him that shall be chosen; for he shall in"
4096,BOOK VII.,"truth profit the well-greaved Achaians, yea and he shall have profit of"
4097,BOOK VII.,"his own soul, if he escape from the fury of war and terrible fray.”"
4098,BOOK VII.,
4099,BOOK VII.,"So said he, and they marked each man his lot and cast them in the"
4100,BOOK VII.,helmet of Agamemnon Atreus’ son; and the hosts prayed and lifted up
4101,BOOK VII.,"their hands to the gods. And thus would one say, looking up to wide"
4102,BOOK VII.,"heaven: “O father Zeus, vouchsafe that the lot fall upon Aias or"
4103,BOOK VII.,"Tydeus’ son, or else on the king of Mykene rich in gold.”"
4104,BOOK VII.,
4105,BOOK VII.,"So spake they, and knightly Nestor of Gerenia shook the helmet, and"
4106,BOOK VII.,"there leapt forth the lot that themselves desired, even the lot of"
4107,BOOK VII.,"Aias. The herald bare it everywhither through the throng, shewing it"
4108,BOOK VII.,from right to left to all the princes of the Achaians; but they knew it
4109,BOOK VII.,"not, and every man denied it. But when he came, bearing it everywhither"
4110,BOOK VII.,"through the throng, to him that had marked it and cast it in the helm,"
4111,BOOK VII.,"even glorious Aias, then he held forth his hand, and the herald stood"
4112,BOOK VII.,by him and put it therein. And Aias saw and knew the token upon the
4113,BOOK VII.,"lot, and rejoiced in heart. He cast it by his foot upon the earth, and"
4114,BOOK VII.,"spake: “My friends, verily the lot is mine, yea and myself am glad at"
4115,BOOK VII.,"heart, because I deem that I shall vanquish goodly Hector. But come"
4116,BOOK VII.,"now, while I clothe me in my armour of battle, pray ye the while to"
4117,BOOK VII.,"Kronos’ son king Zeus, in silence to yourselves, that the Trojans hear"
4118,BOOK VII.,"you not—nay rather, openly if ye will, for we have no fear of any man"
4119,BOOK VII.,"soever. For none by force shall chase me, he willing me unwilling,"
4120,BOOK VII.,"neither by skill; seeing I hope that not so skill-less, either, was I"
4121,BOOK VII.,born in Salamis nor nurtured.”
4122,BOOK VII.,
4123,BOOK VII.,"So said he, and they prayed to Kronos’ son, king Zeus; and thus would"
4124,BOOK VII.,"one speak, looking up to wide heaven: “O father Zeus that rulest from"
4125,BOOK VII.,"Ida, most glorious, most great, vouchsafe to Aias victory and the"
4126,BOOK VII.,"winning of great glory. But if thou so lovest Hector indeed, and carest"
4127,BOOK VII.,"for him, grant unto either equal prowess and renown.”"
4128,BOOK VII.,
4129,BOOK VII.,"So said they, while Aias arrayed him in flashing bronze. And when he"
4130,BOOK VII.,"had now clothed upon his flesh all his armour, then marched he as huge"
4131,BOOK VII.,"Ares coming forth, when he goeth to battle amid heroes whom Kronos’ son"
4132,BOOK VII.,setteth to fight in fury of heart-consuming strife. So rose up huge
4133,BOOK VII.,"Aias, bulwark of the Achaians, with a smile on his grim face: and went"
4134,BOOK VII.,"with long strides of his feet beneath him, shaking his far-shadowing"
4135,BOOK VII.,"spear. Then moreover the Argives rejoiced to look upon him, but sore"
4136,BOOK VII.,"trembling came upon the Trojans, on the limbs of every man, and"
4137,BOOK VII.,Hector’s own heart beat within his breast. But in no wise could he now
4138,BOOK VII.,"flee nor shrink back into the throng of the host, seeing he had"
4139,BOOK VII.,challenged him to battle. And Aias came near bearing his tower-like
4140,BOOK VII.,"shield of bronze, with sevenfold ox-hide, that Tychios had wrought him"
4141,BOOK VII.,"cunningly; Tychios far best of curriers, that had his home in Hyle, who"
4142,BOOK VII.,"made him his glancing shield, of sevenfold hides of stalwart bulls, and"
4143,BOOK VII.,overlaid the seven with bronze. This bare Telamonian Aias before his
4144,BOOK VII.,"breast, and stood near to Hector, and spake to him threatening:"
4145,BOOK VII.,"“Hector, now verily shalt thou well know, man to man, what manner of"
4146,BOOK VII.,"princes the Danaans likewise have among them, even after Achilles,"
4147,BOOK VII.,"render of men, the lion-hearted. But he amid his beaked seafaring ships"
4148,BOOK VII.,lieth in sore wrath with Agamemnon shepherd of the host; yet are we
4149,BOOK VII.,"such as to face thee, yea and many of us. But make thou beginning of"
4150,BOOK VII.,war and battle.”
4151,BOOK VII.,
4152,BOOK VII.,And great Hector of the glancing helm answered him: “Aias of the seed
4153,BOOK VII.,"of Zeus, son of Telamon, chieftain of the host, tempt not thou me like"
4154,BOOK VII.,some puny boy or woman that knoweth not deeds of battle. But I well
4155,BOOK VII.,"know wars and slaughterings. To right know I, to left know I the"
4156,BOOK VII.,wielding of my tough targe; therein I deem is stalwart soldiership. And
4157,BOOK VII.,"I know how to charge into the mellay of fleet chariots, and how in"
4158,BOOK VII.,"close battle to join in furious Ares’ dance. Howbeit, I have no mind to"
4159,BOOK VII.,"smite thee, being such an one as thou art, by spying thee unawares; but"
4160,BOOK VII.,"rather openly, if perchance I may hit thee.”"
4161,BOOK VII.,
4162,BOOK VII.,"He spake, and poised his far-shadowing spear, and hurled and smote"
4163,BOOK VII.,"Aias’ dread shield of sevenfold hide upon the uttermost bronze, the"
4164,BOOK VII.,eighth layer that was thereon. Through six folds went the stubborn
4165,BOOK VII.,"bronze cleaving, but in the seventh hide it stayed. Then heaven-sprung"
4166,BOOK VII.,"Aias hurled next his far-shadowing spear, and smote upon the circle of"
4167,BOOK VII.,the shield of Priam’s son. Through the bright shield passed the violent
4168,BOOK VII.,"spear, and through the curiously wrought corslet pressed it on; and"
4169,BOOK VII.,straight forth beside the flank the spear rent his doublet; but he
4170,BOOK VII.,swerved aside and escaped black death. Then both together with their
4171,BOOK VII.,hands plucked forth their long spears and fell to like ravening lions
4172,BOOK VII.,or wild boars whose might is nowise feeble. Then Priam’s son smote the
4173,BOOK VII.,"shield’s midst with his dart, but the bronze brake not through, for the"
4174,BOOK VII.,"point turned back; but Aias leapt on him and pierced his buckler, and"
4175,BOOK VII.,"straight through went the spear and staggered him in his onset, and"
4176,BOOK VII.,"cleft its way unto his neck, so that the dark blood gushed up. Yet even"
4177,BOOK VII.,"then did not Hector of the glancing helm cease from fight, but yielded"
4178,BOOK VII.,"ground and with stout hand seized a stone lying upon the plain, black"
4179,BOOK VII.,and rugged and great; therewith hurled he and smote Aias’ dread shield
4180,BOOK VII.,"of sevenfold ox-hide in the midst upon the boss, and the bronze"
4181,BOOK VII.,"resounded. Next Aias lifted a far greater stone, and swung and hurled"
4182,BOOK VII.,"it, putting might immeasurable therein. So smote he the buckler and"
4183,BOOK VII.,"burst it inwards with the rock like unto a millstone, and beat down his"
4184,BOOK VII.,"knees; and he was stretched upon his back, pressed into his shield; but"
4185,BOOK VII.,Apollo straightway raised him up. And now had they been smiting hand to
4186,BOOK VII.,"hand with swords, but that the heralds, messengers of gods and men,"
4187,BOOK VII.,"came, one from the Trojans, one from the mail-clad Achaians, even"
4188,BOOK VII.,"Talthybios and Idaios, both men discreet. Between the two held they"
4189,BOOK VII.,"their staves, and herald Idaios spake a word, being skilled in wise"
4190,BOOK VII.,"counsel: “Fight ye no more, dear sons, neither do battle; seeing Zeus"
4191,BOOK VII.,"the cloud-gatherer loveth you both, and both are men of war; that"
4192,BOOK VII.,verily know we all. But night already is upon us: it is well withal to
4193,BOOK VII.,obey the hest of night.”
4194,BOOK VII.,
4195,BOOK VII.,"Then Telamonian Aias answered and said to him: “Idaios, bid ye Hector"
4196,BOOK VII.,to speak those words; of his own self he challenged to combat all our
4197,BOOK VII.,"best. Let him be first, and I will surely follow as he saith.”"
4198,BOOK VII.,
4199,BOOK VII.,"Then great Hector of the glancing helm said to him: “Aias, seeing God"
4200,BOOK VII.,"gave thee stature and might and wisdom, and with the spear thou art"
4201,BOOK VII.,"excellent above all the Achaians, let us now cease from combat and"
4202,BOOK VII.,battle for the day; but hereafter will we fight until God judge between
4203,BOOK VII.,"us, giving to one of us the victory. But night already is upon us; it"
4204,BOOK VII.,is well withal to obey the hest of night; that so thou mayest rejoice
4205,BOOK VII.,"all the Achaians beside their ships, and chiefly the kinsmen and"
4206,BOOK VII.,fellows that are thine; and I throughout the great city of king Priam
4207,BOOK VII.,"will rejoice the Trojan men and Trojan dames with trailing robes, that"
4208,BOOK VII.,"with prayer I ween will enter the holy assemblage. But come, let us"
4209,BOOK VII.,"give each the other famous gifts, that men may thus say, Achaians alike"
4210,BOOK VII.,"and Trojans: ‘These, having fought for sake of heart-consuming strife,"
4211,BOOK VII.,parted again reconciled in friendship.’”
4212,BOOK VII.,
4213,BOOK VII.,"So said he, and gave him his silver-studded sword, with scabbard and"
4214,BOOK VII.,well-cut baldrick; and Aias gave his belt bright with purple. So they
4215,BOOK VII.,"parted, and one went to the Achaian host, and one betook him to the"
4216,BOOK VII.,throng of Trojans. And these rejoiced to behold him come to them alive
4217,BOOK VII.,"and sound, escaped from the fury of Aias and his hands unapproachable;"
4218,BOOK VII.,and they brought him to the city saved beyond their hope. And Aias on
4219,BOOK VII.,"their side the well-greaved Achaians brought to noble Agamemnon,"
4220,BOOK VII.,exulting in his victory.
4221,BOOK VII.,
4222,BOOK VII.,"So when these were come unto the huts of Atreides, then did Agamemnon"
4223,BOOK VII.,"king of men slay them an ox, a male of five years old, for the most"
4224,BOOK VII.,"mighty son of Kronos. This they flayed and made ready, and divided it"
4225,BOOK VII.,"all, and minced it cunningly, and pierced it through with spits, and"
4226,BOOK VII.,"roasted it carefully, and drew all off again. Then as soon as they had"
4227,BOOK VII.,"rest from the task and had made ready the meal, they began the feast,"
4228,BOOK VII.,nor was their soul aught stinted of the equal banquet. And the hero son
4229,BOOK VII.,"of Atreus, wide-ruling Agamemnon, gave to Aias slices of the chine’s"
4230,BOOK VII.,full length for his honour. And when they had put from them the desire
4231,BOOK VII.,"of meat and drink, then first the old man began to weave the web of"
4232,BOOK VII.,"counsel, even Nestor whose rede of old time was proved most excellent."
4233,BOOK VII.,He of good intent made harangue among them and said: “Son of Atreus and
4234,BOOK VII.,"ye other princes of the Achaians, seeing that many flowing-haired"
4235,BOOK VII.,"Achaians are dead, and keen Ares hath spilt their dusky blood about"
4236,BOOK VII.,"fair-flowing Skamandros, and their souls have gone down to the house of"
4237,BOOK VII.,Hades; therefore it behoveth thee to make the battle of the Achaians
4238,BOOK VII.,cease with daybreak; and we will assemble to wheel hither the corpses
4239,BOOK VII.,"with oxen and mules; so let us burn them [a little way from the ships,"
4240,BOOK VII.,"that each man may bear their bones home to their children, whene’er we"
4241,BOOK VII.,return again to our native land]; and let us heap one barrow about the
4242,BOOK VII.,"pyre, rearing it from the plain for all alike; and thereto build with"
4243,BOOK VII.,"speed high towers, a bulwark for our ships and for ourselves. In the"
4244,BOOK VII.,"midst thereof let us make gates well compact, that through them may be"
4245,BOOK VII.,"a way for chariot-driving. And without let us dig a deep foss hard by,"
4246,BOOK VII.,"to be about it and to hinder horses and footmen, lest the battle of the"
4247,BOOK VII.,lordly Trojans be heavy on us hereafter.”
4248,BOOK VII.,
4249,BOOK VII.,So spake he and all the chiefs gave assent. But meanwhile there was in
4250,BOOK VII.,"the high town of Ilios an assembly of the Trojans, fierce, confused,"
4251,BOOK VII.,beside Priam’s gate. To them discreet Antenor began to make harangue:
4252,BOOK VII.,"“Hearken to me, Trojans and Dardanians and allies, that I may tell you"
4253,BOOK VII.,"that my soul within my breast commandeth me. Lo, go to now, let us give"
4254,BOOK VII.,Helen of Argos and the wealth with her for the sons of Atreus to take
4255,BOOK VII.,away. Now fight we in guilt against the oaths of faith; therefore is
4256,BOOK VII.,"there no profit for us that I hope to see fulfilled, unless we do"
4257,BOOK VII.,thus.”
4258,BOOK VII.,
4259,BOOK VII.,So spake he and sate him down; and there stood up among them noble
4260,BOOK VII.,"Alexandros, lord of Helen beautiful-haired; he made him answer and"
4261,BOOK VII.,"spake winged words: “Antenor, these words from thee are no longer to my"
4262,BOOK VII.,pleasure; yet thou hast it in thee to devise other sayings more
4263,BOOK VII.,"excellent than this. But if indeed thou sayest this in earnest, then"
4264,BOOK VII.,verily the gods themselves have destroyed thy wit. But I will speak
4265,BOOK VII.,"forth amid the horse-taming Trojans, and declare outright; my wife will"
4266,BOOK VII.,"I not give back; but the wealth I brought from Argos to our home, all"
4267,BOOK VII.,"that I have a mind to give, and add more of mine own substance.”"
4268,BOOK VII.,
4269,BOOK VII.,"So spake he and sate him down, and there stood up among them Priam of"
4270,BOOK VII.,"the seed of Dardanos, the peer of gods in counsel; he made harangue to"
4271,BOOK VII.,"them, and said: “Hearken to me, Trojans and Dardanians and allies, that"
4272,BOOK VII.,I may tell you that my soul within my breast commandeth me. Now eat
4273,BOOK VII.,"your supper throughout the city as of old, and take thought to keep"
4274,BOOK VII.,"watch, and be wakeful every man. And at dawn let Idaios fare to the"
4275,BOOK VII.,hollow ships to tell to Atreus’ sons Agamemnon and Menelaos the saying
4276,BOOK VII.,"of Alexandros, for whose sake strife is come about: and likewise to ask"
4277,BOOK VII.,"them this wise word, whether they are minded to refrain from noisy war"
4278,BOOK VII.,"till we have burned our dead; afterwards will we fight again, till"
4279,BOOK VII.,heaven part us and give one or other victory.”
4280,BOOK VII.,
4281,BOOK VII.,"So spake he, and they hearkened diligently to him and obeyed; [then"
4282,BOOK VII.,"took they their supper throughout the host by ranks,] and at dawn"
4283,BOOK VII.,"Idaios fared to the hollow ships. He found the Danaans in assembly, the"
4284,BOOK VII.,"men of Ares’ company, beside the stern of Agamemnon’s ship; and so the"
4285,BOOK VII.,loud-voiced herald stood in their midst and said unto them: “Atreides
4286,BOOK VII.,"and ye other princes of the Achaians, Priam and all the noble Trojans"
4287,BOOK VII.,bade me tell you—if perchance it might find favour and acceptance with
4288,BOOK VII.,"you—the saying of Alexandros, for whose sake strife hath come about."
4289,BOOK VII.,The wealth that Alexandros brought in his hollow ships to Troy—would he
4290,BOOK VII.,"had perished first!—all that he hath a mind to give, and to add more"
4291,BOOK VII.,thereto of his substance. But the wedded wife of glorious Menelaos he
4292,BOOK VII.,saith he will not give; yet verily the Trojans bid him do it. Moreover
4293,BOOK VII.,they bade me ask this thing of you; whether ye are minded to refrain
4294,BOOK VII.,from noisy war until we have burned our dead; afterwards will we fight
4295,BOOK VII.,"again, till heaven part us and give one or other victory.”"
4296,BOOK VII.,
4297,BOOK VII.,So said he and they all kept silence and were still. But at the last
4298,BOOK VII.,spake Diomedes of the loud war-cry in their midst: “Let no man now
4299,BOOK VII.,"accept Alexandros’ substance, neither Helen’s self; known is it, even"
4300,BOOK VII.,"to him that hath no wit at all, how that the issues of destruction hang"
4301,BOOK VII.,already over the Trojans.”
4302,BOOK VII.,
4303,BOOK VII.,"So spake he, and all the sons of the Achaians shouted, applauding the"
4304,BOOK VII.,saying of horse-taming Diomedes. And then lord Agamemnon spake to
4305,BOOK VII.,"Idaios: “Idaios, thyself thou hearest the saying of the Achaians, how"
4306,BOOK VII.,they answer thee; and the like seemeth good to me. But as concerning
4307,BOOK VII.,"the dead, I grudge you not to burn them; for dead corpses is there no"
4308,BOOK VII.,"stinting; when they once are dead, of the swift propitiation of fire."
4309,BOOK VII.,"And for the oaths let Zeus be witness, the loud-thundering lord of"
4310,BOOK VII.,Hera.”
4311,BOOK VII.,
4312,BOOK VII.,"So saying he lifted up his sceptre in the sight of all the gods, and"
4313,BOOK VII.,Idaios departed back to holy Ilios. Now Trojans and Dardanians sate in
4314,BOOK VII.,"assembly, gathered all together to wait till Idaios should come; and he"
4315,BOOK VII.,came and stood in their midst and declared his message. Then they made
4316,BOOK VII.,"them ready very swiftly for either task, some to bring the dead, and"
4317,BOOK VII.,some to seek for wood. And on their part the Argives hasted from their
4318,BOOK VII.,"well-decked ships, some to bring the dead and some to seek for wood."
4319,BOOK VII.,
4320,BOOK VII.,Now the sun was newly beating on the fields as he climbed heaven from
4321,BOOK VII.,"the deep stream of gently-flowing Ocean, when both sides met together."
4322,BOOK VII.,Then was it a hard matter to know each man again; but they washed them
4323,BOOK VII.,"with water clean of clotted gore, and with shedding of hot tears lifted"
4324,BOOK VII.,them upon the wains. But great Priam bade them not wail aloud; so in
4325,BOOK VII.,"silence heaped they the corpses on the pyre, stricken at heart; and"
4326,BOOK VII.,when they had burned them with fire departed to holy Ilios. And in like
4327,BOOK VII.,manner on their side the well-greaved Achaians heaped the corpses on
4328,BOOK VII.,"the pyre, stricken at heart, and when they had burned them with fire"
4329,BOOK VII.,departed to the hollow ships.
4330,BOOK VII.,
4331,BOOK VII.,"And when day was not yet, but still twilight of night, then was the"
4332,BOOK VII.,"chosen folk of the Achaians gathered together* around the pyre, and"
4333,BOOK VII.,"made one barrow about it, rearing it from the plain for all alike; and"
4334,BOOK VII.,"thereto built they a wall and lofty towers, a bulwark for their ships"
4335,BOOK VII.,and for themselves. In the midst thereof made they gates
4336,BOOK VII.,"well-compacted, that through them might be a way for chariot-driving."
4337,BOOK VII.,"And without they dug a deep foss beside it, broad and great, and"
4338,BOOK VII.,planted a palisade therein.
4339,BOOK VII.,
4340,BOOK VII.,Reading ἤγρετο for ἔγρετο.
4341,BOOK VII.,
4342,BOOK VII.,
4343,BOOK VII.,"Thus toiled the flowing-haired Achaians: and the gods sate by Zeus, the"
4344,BOOK VII.,"lord of lightning, and marvelled at the great work of the mail-clad"
4345,BOOK VII.,Achaians. And Poseidon shaker of earth spake first to them: “O father
4346,BOOK VII.,"Zeus, is there any man throughout the boundless earth that will any"
4347,BOOK VII.,more declare to the immortals his mind and counsel? Seest thou not how
4348,BOOK VII.,the flowing-haired Achaians have now again built them a wall before
4349,BOOK VII.,"their ships, and drawn a foss around it, but gave not excellent"
4350,BOOK VII.,hecatombs to the gods? Verily the fame thereof shall reach as far as
4351,BOOK VII.,"the dawn spreadeth, and men will forget the wall that I and Phoebus"
4352,BOOK VII.,Apollo built with travail for the hero Laomedon.”
4353,BOOK VII.,
4354,BOOK VII.,"And Zeus the cloud-gatherer said to him, sore troubled: “Out on it,"
4355,BOOK VII.,"far-swaying Shaker of earth, for this thing thou sayest. Well might"
4356,BOOK VII.,"some other god fear this device, one that were far feebler than thou in"
4357,BOOK VII.,the might of his hands: but thine shall be the fame as far as the dawn
4358,BOOK VII.,"spreadeth. Go to now, hereafter when the flowing-haired Achaians be"
4359,BOOK VII.,"departed upon their ships to their dear native land, then burst thou"
4360,BOOK VII.,"this wall asunder and scatter it all into the sea, and cover the great"
4361,BOOK VII.,"sea-beach over with sand again, that the great wall of the Achaians be"
4362,BOOK VII.,brought to naught.”
4363,BOOK VII.,
4364,BOOK VII.,"Such converse held these one with the other, and the sun went down, and"
4365,BOOK VII.,the work of the Achaians was accomplished; and they slaughtered oxen
4366,BOOK VII.,"amid the huts, and took supper. And many ships from Lemnos, bearing"
4367,BOOK VII.,"wine, were at hand, sent of Jason’s son Euneos, whom Hypsipyle bare to"
4368,BOOK VII.,"Jason shepherd of the host. And specially for Atreus’ sons, Agamemnon"
4369,BOOK VII.,"and Menelaos, Jason’s son gave a freight of wine, even a thousand"
4370,BOOK VII.,"measures. So the flowing-haired Achaians bought them wine thence, some"
4371,BOOK VII.,"for bronze and some for gleaming iron, and some with hides and some"
4372,BOOK VII.,"with whole kine, and some with captives; and they set a rich feast"
4373,BOOK VII.,"before them. Then all night long feasted the flowing-haired Achaians,"
4374,BOOK VII.,and in the city the Trojans and allies; and all night long Zeus the
4375,BOOK VII.,lord of counsel devised them ill with terrible thunderings. Then pale
4376,BOOK VII.,"fear gat hold upon them, and they spilt wine from their cups upon the"
4377,BOOK VII.,"earth, neither durst any drink till he had made libation to most mighty"
4378,BOOK VII.,Kronion. Then laid they them to rest and took the boon of sleep.

4384,BOOK VIII.,
4385,BOOK VIII.,
4386,BOOK VIII.,How Zeus bethought him of his promise to avenge Achilles’ wrong on
4387,BOOK VIII.,"Agamemnon: and therefore bade the gods refrain from war, and gave"
4388,BOOK VIII.,victory to the Trojans.
4389,BOOK VIII.,
4390,BOOK VIII.,
4391,BOOK VIII.,"Now Dawn the saffron-robed was spreading over all the earth, and Zeus"
4392,BOOK VIII.,whose joy is in the thunder let call an assembly of the gods upon the
4393,BOOK VIII.,"topmost peak of many-ridged Olympus, and himself made harangue to them"
4394,BOOK VIII.,"and all the gods gave ear: “Hearken to me, all gods and all ye"
4395,BOOK VIII.,"goddesses, that I may tell you what my heart within my breast"
4396,BOOK VIII.,"commandeth me. One thing let none essay, be it goddess or be it god, to"
4397,BOOK VIII.,"wit, to thwart my saying; approve ye it all together, that with all"
4398,BOOK VIII.,speed I may accomplish these things. Whomsoever I shall perceive minded
4399,BOOK VIII.,"to go, apart from the gods, to succour Trojans or Danaans, chastened in"
4400,BOOK VIII.,"no seemly wise shall he return to Olympus, or I will take and cast him"
4401,BOOK VIII.,"into misty Tartaros, right far away, where is the deepest gulf beneath"
4402,BOOK VIII.,"the earth; there are the gate of iron and threshold of bronze, as far"
4403,BOOK VIII.,beneath Hades as heaven is high above the earth: then shall he know how
4404,BOOK VIII.,"far I am mightiest of all gods. Go to now, ye gods, make trial that ye"
4405,BOOK VIII.,"all may know. Fasten ye a rope of gold from heaven, and all ye gods lay"
4406,BOOK VIII.,hold thereof and all goddesses; yet could ye not drag from heaven to
4407,BOOK VIII.,"earth Zeus, counsellor supreme, not though ye toiled sore. But once I"
4408,BOOK VIII.,"likewise were minded to draw with all my heart, then should I draw you"
4409,BOOK VIII.,up with very earth and sea withal. Thereafter would I bind the rope
4410,BOOK VIII.,"about a pinnacle of Olympus, and so should all those things be hung in"
4411,BOOK VIII.,air. By so much am I beyond gods and beyond men.”
4412,BOOK VIII.,
4413,BOOK VIII.,"So said he, and they all kept silence and were still, marvelling at his"
4414,BOOK VIII.,saying; for he spake very masterfully. But at the last there spake to
4415,BOOK VIII.,"them the bright-eyed goddess Athene: “O our father Kronides, supreme of"
4416,BOOK VIII.,"lords, well we know, even we, that thy might is unyielding; yet still"
4417,BOOK VIII.,"have we pity for the Danaan spearmen, that now shall perish and fulfil"
4418,BOOK VIII.,"a grievous fate. Yet will we refrain from battle as thou biddest us,"
4419,BOOK VIII.,"but counsel will we offer to the Argives for their profit, that they"
4420,BOOK VIII.,perish not all at thy wrath.”
4421,BOOK VIII.,
4422,BOOK VIII.,Then Zeus the cloud-gatherer smiled at her and said: “Be of good
4423,BOOK VIII.,"comfort, dear child, Trito-born; I speak not at all of earnest purpose,"
4424,BOOK VIII.,but I am minded to be kindly to thee”
4425,BOOK VIII.,
4426,BOOK VIII.,"So saying he let harness to his chariot his bronze-shod horses, fleet"
4427,BOOK VIII.,"of foot, with flowing manes of gold; and himself clad him with gold"
4428,BOOK VIII.,"upon his flesh, and grasped the whip of gold, well-wrought, and mounted"
4429,BOOK VIII.,"upon his car, and lashed the horses to start them; they nothing loth"
4430,BOOK VIII.,sped on between earth and starry heaven. So fared he to many-fountained
4431,BOOK VIII.,"Ida, mother of wild beasts, even unto Gargaros, where is his demesne"
4432,BOOK VIII.,and fragrant altar. There did the father of men and gods stay his
4433,BOOK VIII.,"horses, and unloose them from the car, and cast thick mist about them;"
4434,BOOK VIII.,"and himself sate on the mountain-tops rejoicing in his glory, to behold"
4435,BOOK VIII.,the city of the Trojans and ships of the Achaians.
4436,BOOK VIII.,
4437,BOOK VIII.,Now the flowing-haired Achaians took meat hastily among the huts and
4438,BOOK VIII.,thereafter arrayed themselves. Likewise the Trojans on their side armed
4439,BOOK VIII.,"them throughout the town—a smaller host, yet for all that were they"
4440,BOOK VIII.,"eager to fight in battle, of forceful need, for their children’s sake"
4441,BOOK VIII.,and their wives’. And the gates were opened wide and the host issued
4442,BOOK VIII.,"forth, footmen and horsemen; and mighty din arose."
4443,BOOK VIII.,
4444,BOOK VIII.,"So when they were met together and come unto one spot, then clashed"
4445,BOOK VIII.,they targe and spear and fury of bronze-clad warrior; the bossed
4446,BOOK VIII.,"shields pressed each on each, and mighty din arose. Then were heard the"
4447,BOOK VIII.,voice of groaning and the voice of triumph together of the slayers and
4448,BOOK VIII.,"the slain, and the earth streamed with blood."
4449,BOOK VIII.,
4450,BOOK VIII.,"Now while it yet was morn and the divine day waxed, so long from either"
4451,BOOK VIII.,side lighted the darts amain and the people fell. But when the sun
4452,BOOK VIII.,"bestrode mid-heaven, then did the Father balance his golden scales, and"
4453,BOOK VIII.,"put therein two fates of death that layeth men at their length,* one"
4454,BOOK VIII.,"for horse-taming Trojans, one for mail-clad Achaians; and he took the"
4455,BOOK VIII.,"scale-yard by the midst and lifted it, and the Achaians’ day of destiny"
4456,BOOK VIII.,"sank down. So lay the Achaians’ fates on the bounteous earth, and the"
4457,BOOK VIII.,Trojans’ fates were lifted up towards wide heaven. And the god
4458,BOOK VIII.,"thundered aloud from Ida, and sent his blazing flash amid the host of"
4459,BOOK VIII.,"the Achaians; and they saw and were astonished, and pale fear gat hold"
4460,BOOK VIII.,upon all.
4461,BOOK VIII.,
4462,BOOK VIII.,* Perhaps rather “death that bringeth long woe.”
4463,BOOK VIII.,
4464,BOOK VIII.,
4465,BOOK VIII.,"Then had Idomeneus no heart to stand, neither Agamemnon, neither stood"
4466,BOOK VIII.,"the twain Aiantes, men of Ares’ company. Only Nestor of Gerenia stood"
4467,BOOK VIII.,"his ground, he the Warden of the Achaians; neither he of purpose, but"
4468,BOOK VIII.,"his horse was fordone, which noble Alexandros, beauteous-haired Helen’s"
4469,BOOK VIII.,"lord, had smitten with an arrow upon the top of the crest where the"
4470,BOOK VIII.,foremost hairs of horses grow upon the skull; and there is the most
4471,BOOK VIII.,deadly spot. So the horse leapt up in anguish and the arrow sank into
4472,BOOK VIII.,"his brain, and he brought confusion on the steeds as he writhed upon"
4473,BOOK VIII.,the dart. While the old man leapt forth and with his sword began to hew
4474,BOOK VIII.,"the traces, came Hector’s fleet horses through the tumult, bearing a"
4475,BOOK VIII.,"bold charioteer, even Hecktor. And now had the old man lost his life,"
4476,BOOK VIII.,but that Diomedes of the loud war-cry was swift to mark. Terribly
4477,BOOK VIII.,"shouted he, summoning Odysseus: “Heaven-born son of Laertes, Odysseus"
4478,BOOK VIII.,"of many wiles, whither fleest thou with thy back turned, like a coward"
4479,BOOK VIII.,in the throng? Beware lest as thou fleest one plant a spear between thy
4480,BOOK VIII.,"shoulders. Nay, stand thy ground, till we thrust back from the old man"
4481,BOOK VIII.,his furious foe.”
4482,BOOK VIII.,
4483,BOOK VIII.,"So spake he, but much-enduring noble Odysseus heard him not, but"
4484,BOOK VIII.,"hastened by to the hollow ships of the Achaians. Yet Tydeides, though"
4485,BOOK VIII.,"but one, mingled amid the fighters in the forefront, and took his stand"
4486,BOOK VIII.,"before the steeds of the old man, Neleus’ son, and spake to him winged"
4487,BOOK VIII.,"words, and said: “Old man, of a truth young warriors beset thee hard;"
4488,BOOK VIII.,"and thy force is abated, and old age is sore upon thee, and thy squire"
4489,BOOK VIII.,"is but a weakling, and thy steeds are slow. Come then, mount upon my"
4490,BOOK VIII.,"car, that thou mayest see of what sort are the steeds of Tros, well"
4491,BOOK VIII.,skilled for following or fleeing hither or thither very fleetly across
4492,BOOK VIII.,"the plain, even those that erst I took from Aineias inspirer of fear.*"
4493,BOOK VIII.,"Thine let our squires tend, and these let us guide straight against the"
4494,BOOK VIII.,"horse-taming Trojans, that even Hector may know whether my spear also"
4495,BOOK VIII.,rageth in my hands.”
4496,BOOK VIII.,
4497,BOOK VIII.,* Reading μήστωρα. See Book V. 272.
4498,BOOK VIII.,
4499,BOOK VIII.,
4500,BOOK VIII.,"So said he, and knightly Nestor of Gerenia disregarded not. Then the"
4501,BOOK VIII.,"two squires tended Nestor’s horses, even Sthenelos the valiant and"
4502,BOOK VIII.,kindly Eurymedon: and the other twain both mounted upon Diomedes’ car.
4503,BOOK VIII.,"And Nestor took into his hands the shining reins, and lashed the"
4504,BOOK VIII.,horses; and soon they drew nigh Hector. Then Tydeus’ son hurled at him
4505,BOOK VIII.,"as he charged straight upon them: him missed he, but his squire that"
4506,BOOK VIII.,"drave his chariot, Eniopeus, high-hearted Thebaios’ son, even him as he"
4507,BOOK VIII.,"held the reins, he smote upon the breast beside the nipple. So he fell"
4508,BOOK VIII.,"from out the car, and his fleet-footed horses swerved aside; and there"
4509,BOOK VIII.,his soul and spirit were unstrung. Then sore grief encompassed Hector’s
4510,BOOK VIII.,"soul for sake of his charioteer. Yet left he him there lying, though he"
4511,BOOK VIII.,"sorrowed for his comrade, and drave in quest of a bold charioteer; and"
4512,BOOK VIII.,"his horses lacked not long a master, for anon he found Iphitos’ son,"
4513,BOOK VIII.,"bold Archeptolemos, and him he made mount behind his fleet horses, and"
4514,BOOK VIII.,gave the reins into his hands.
4515,BOOK VIII.,
4516,BOOK VIII.,"Then had destruction come and deeds beyond remedy been wrought, and so"
4517,BOOK VIII.,"had they been penned in Ilios like lambs, had not the father of gods"
4518,BOOK VIII.,and men been swift to mark. So he thundered terribly and darted his
4519,BOOK VIII.,white lightning and hurled it before Diomedes’ steeds to earth; and
4520,BOOK VIII.,"there arose a terrible flame of sulphur burning, and the two horses"
4521,BOOK VIII.,were affrighted and cowered beneath the car. And the shining reins
4522,BOOK VIII.,"dropped from Nestor’s hands, and he was afraid at heart and spake to"
4523,BOOK VIII.,"Diomedes: “Come now Tydeides, turn back thy whole-hooved horses to"
4524,BOOK VIII.,flight: seest thou not that victory from Zeus attendeth not on thee?
4525,BOOK VIII.,"Now doth Kronos’ son vouchsafe glory to this Hector, for the day;"
4526,BOOK VIII.,"hereafter shall he grant it us likewise, if he will. A man may not at"
4527,BOOK VIII.,"all ward off the will of Zeus, not though one be very valiant; he"
4528,BOOK VIII.,verily is mightier far.”
4529,BOOK VIII.,
4530,BOOK VIII.,"Then Diomedes of the loud war-cry answered him: “Yea verily, old man,"
4531,BOOK VIII.,all this thou sayest is according unto right. But this is the sore
4532,BOOK VIII.,grief that entereth my heart and soul; Hector some day shall say as he
4533,BOOK VIII.,maketh harangue amid the Trojans: ‘Tydeides betook him to the ships in
4534,BOOK VIII.,flight before my face.’ So shall he boast—in that day let the wide
4535,BOOK VIII.,earth yawn for me.”
4536,BOOK VIII.,
4537,BOOK VIII.,"Then knightly Nestor of Gerenia answered him: “Ah me, thou son of wise"
4538,BOOK VIII.,"Tydeus, that thou shouldest speak on this wise! Even though Hector call"
4539,BOOK VIII.,"thee a base man and coward, yet will not the Trojans hearken to him nor"
4540,BOOK VIII.,"the Dardanians, neither the wives of the great-hearted men of Troy,"
4541,BOOK VIII.,"bearers of the shield, the wives whose lusty bedfellows thou hast laid"
4542,BOOK VIII.,low in the dust.”
4543,BOOK VIII.,
4544,BOOK VIII.,"So spake he and turned the whole-hooved horses to flight, back through"
4545,BOOK VIII.,the tumult; and the Trojans and Hector with wondrous uproar poured upon
4546,BOOK VIII.,them their dolorous darts. And over him shouted loudly great Hector of
4547,BOOK VIII.,"the glancing helm: “Tydeides, the fleet-horsed Danaans were wont to"
4548,BOOK VIII.,"honour thee with the highest place, and meats, and cups brimful, but"
4549,BOOK VIII.,now will they disdain thee; thou art after all no better than a woman.
4550,BOOK VIII.,"Begone, poor puppet; not for my flinching shalt thou climb on our"
4551,BOOK VIII.,"towers, neither carry our wives away upon thy ships; ere that will I"
4552,BOOK VIII.,deal thee thy fate.”
4553,BOOK VIII.,
4554,BOOK VIII.,"So said he, and Tydeides was of divided mind, whether to wheel his"
4555,BOOK VIII.,"horses and fight him face to face. Thrice doubted he in heart and soul,"
4556,BOOK VIII.,"and thrice from Ida’s mountains thundered Zeus the lord of counsel, and"
4557,BOOK VIII.,"gave to the Trojans a sign, the turning of the course of battle. And"
4558,BOOK VIII.,Hector with loud shout called to the Trojans: “Trojans and Lykians and
4559,BOOK VIII.,"Dardanians that love close fight, be men, my friends, and bethink you"
4560,BOOK VIII.,of impetuous valour. I perceive that of good will Kronion vouchsafest
4561,BOOK VIII.,"me victory and great glory, and to the Danaans destruction. Fools, that"
4562,BOOK VIII.,devised these walls weak and of none account; they shall not withhold
4563,BOOK VIII.,"our fury, and lightly shall our steeds overleap the delved foss. But"
4564,BOOK VIII.,"when I be once come amid the hollow ships, then be thought taken of"
4565,BOOK VIII.,"consuming fire, that with fire I may burn the ships and slay the men,"
4566,BOOK VIII.,"even the Argives amid their ships, in confusion beneath the smoke.”"
4567,BOOK VIII.,
4568,BOOK VIII.,"So spake he and shouted to his steeds, and said: “Xanthos, and thou"
4569,BOOK VIII.,"Podargos, and Aithon and goodly Lampos, now pay me back your tending,"
4570,BOOK VIII.,"even the abundance that Andromache, great-hearted Eëtion’s daughter,"
4571,BOOK VIII.,"set before you of honey-hearted wheat, and mingled wine to drink at the"
4572,BOOK VIII.,"heart’s bidding, sooner than for me, that verily avow me to be her"
4573,BOOK VIII.,"lusty spouse. Pursue ye now and haste, that we may seize Nestor’s"
4574,BOOK VIII.,"shield, the fame whereof now reacheth unto heaven, how that it is of"
4575,BOOK VIII.,"gold throughout, armrods and all; and may seize moreover from"
4576,BOOK VIII.,horse-taming Diomedes’ shoulders his richly dight breastplate that
4577,BOOK VIII.,"Hephaistos wrought cunningly. Could we but take these, then might I"
4578,BOOK VIII.,hope this very night to make the Achaians to embark on their fleet
4579,BOOK VIII.,ships.”
4580,BOOK VIII.,
4581,BOOK VIII.,"So spake he boastfully, and queen Hera had indignation, and stirred her"
4582,BOOK VIII.,"upon her throne and made high Olympus quake, and answered and said to"
4583,BOOK VIII.,"the great god Poseidon: “Out on it, far-swaying Shaker of Earth; not"
4584,BOOK VIII.,even thine heart within thy breast hath pity on the Danaans perishing.
4585,BOOK VIII.,Yet bring they to thee in Helike and Aigai offerings many and gracious:
4586,BOOK VIII.,"wish thou them victory. Did we but will, we that are confederate with"
4587,BOOK VIII.,"the Danaans, to drive the Trojans back and withhold far-seeing Zeus,"
4588,BOOK VIII.,then would he vex himself that he should sit there alone in Ida.”
4589,BOOK VIII.,
4590,BOOK VIII.,Then was the lord the Shaker of earth sore troubled and made answer:
4591,BOOK VIII.,"“Hera headstrong in speech, what is this thing thou sayest? I am not he"
4592,BOOK VIII.,"that would fain see us all at strife with Zeus Kronion, for he verily"
4593,BOOK VIII.,is mightier far.”
4594,BOOK VIII.,
4595,BOOK VIII.,Thus spake they to each other; and now was all the space that from the
4596,BOOK VIII.,"ships the moat enclosed, even unto the wall, filled full of horses"
4597,BOOK VIII.,together and shield-bearing warriors pent: so pent them Hector Priam’s
4598,BOOK VIII.,"son, peer of fleet Ares, now that Zeus vouchsafed him glory. And now"
4599,BOOK VIII.,"had he burned the trim ships with blazing fire, but that queen Hera put"
4600,BOOK VIII.,it in Agamemnon’s heart himself to bestir him and swiftly arouse the
4601,BOOK VIII.,"Achaians. So he went his way along the huts and ships of the Achaians,"
4602,BOOK VIII.,"holding a great cloak of purple in his stalwart hand, and stood by"
4603,BOOK VIII.,"Odysseus’ black ship of mighty burden, that was in the midst, so that a"
4604,BOOK VIII.,"voice could be heard to either end, whether to the huts of Aias son of"
4605,BOOK VIII.,"Telamon, or of Achilles; for these had drawn their trim ships up at the"
4606,BOOK VIII.,"uttermost ends, trusting to their valour and to the might of their"
4607,BOOK VIII.,"hands. Then shouted he in a piercing voice, and called to the Danaans"
4608,BOOK VIII.,"aloud: “Fie upon you, Argives, ye sorry things of shame, so brave in"
4609,BOOK VIII.,semblance! Whither are gone our boastings when we said that we were
4610,BOOK VIII.,"bravest, the boasts ye uttered vaingloriously when in Lemnos, as ye ate"
4611,BOOK VIII.,your fill of flesh of tall-horned oxen and drank goblets crowned with
4612,BOOK VIII.,"wine, and said that every man should stand in war to face fivescore yea"
4613,BOOK VIII.,"tenscore Trojans? yet now can we not match one, even this Hector that"
4614,BOOK VIII.,"anon will burn our ships with flame of fire. O Father Zeus, didst ever"
4615,BOOK VIII.,"thou blind with such a blindness any mighty king, and rob him of great"
4616,BOOK VIII.,glory? Yet I ween that never in my benched ship passed I by a fair
4617,BOOK VIII.,"altar of thine on my mad way hither, but upon all I burnt fat and"
4618,BOOK VIII.,"thighs of oxen, being eager to lay waste well-walled Troy. Nay, Zeus,"
4619,BOOK VIII.,this hope fulfil thou me; suffer that we ourselves at least flee and
4620,BOOK VIII.,"escape, neither suffer that the Achaians be thus vanquished of the"
4621,BOOK VIII.,Trojans.”
4622,BOOK VIII.,
4623,BOOK VIII.,"So spake he, and the Father had pity on him as he wept, and vouchsafed"
4624,BOOK VIII.,him that his folk should be saved and perish not. Forthwith sent he an
4625,BOOK VIII.,"eagle—surest sign among winged fowl—holding in his claws a fawn, the"
4626,BOOK VIII.,young of a fleet hind; beside the beautiful altar of Zeus he let fall
4627,BOOK VIII.,"the fawn, where the Achaians did sacrifice unto Zeus lord of all"
4628,BOOK VIII.,"oracles. So when they saw that the bird was come from Zeus, they sprang"
4629,BOOK VIII.,the more upon the Trojans and bethought them of the joy of battle.
4630,BOOK VIII.,
4631,BOOK VIII.,"Now could no man of the Danaans, for all they were very many, boast"
4632,BOOK VIII.,"that he before Tydeus’ son had guided his fleet horses forth, and"
4633,BOOK VIII.,driven them across the trench and fought man to man; first by far was
4634,BOOK VIII.,"Tydeides to slay a warrior of the Trojans in full array, even Agelaos"
4635,BOOK VIII.,son of Phradmon. Now he had turned his steeds to flee; but as he
4636,BOOK VIII.,wheeled the other plunged the spear into his back between his
4637,BOOK VIII.,"shoulders, and drave it through his breast. So fell he from his"
4638,BOOK VIII.,"chariot, and his armour clanged upon him."
4639,BOOK VIII.,
4640,BOOK VIII.,"And after him came Atreus’ sons, even Agamemnon and Menelaos, and after"
4641,BOOK VIII.,"them the Aiantes clothed upon with impetuous valour, and after them"
4642,BOOK VIII.,"Idomeneus and Idomeneus’ brother in arms Meriones, peer of Enyalios"
4643,BOOK VIII.,"slayer of men, and after them Eurypylos, Euaimon’s glorious son. And"
4644,BOOK VIII.,"ninth came Teukros, stretching his back-bent bow, and took his stand"
4645,BOOK VIII.,beneath the shield of Aias son of Telamon. And so Aias would stealthily
4646,BOOK VIII.,"withdraw the shield, and Teukros would spy his chance; and when he had"
4647,BOOK VIII.,"shot and smitten one in the throng, then fell such an one and gave up"
4648,BOOK VIII.,"the ghost, and Teukros would return, and as a child beneath his mother,"
4649,BOOK VIII.,so gat he him to Aias; who hid him with the shining shield.
4650,BOOK VIII.,
4651,BOOK VIII.,Now who first of the Trojans was slain of noble Teukros? Orsilochos
4652,BOOK VIII.,first and Ormenos and Ophelestes and Daitor and Chromios and godlike
4653,BOOK VIII.,Lykophontes and Amopaon Polyaimon’s son and Melanippos; all these in
4654,BOOK VIII.,turn laid he upon the bounteous earth. And Agamemnon king of men
4655,BOOK VIII.,rejoiced to behold him making havoc with his stalwart bow of the
4656,BOOK VIII.,"battalions of the Trojans, and he came and stood by his side and spake"
4657,BOOK VIII.,"to him, saying: “Teukros, dear heart, thou son of Telamon, prince of"
4658,BOOK VIII.,"the host, shoot on in this wise, if perchance thou mayest be found the"
4659,BOOK VIII.,salvation of the Danaans and glory of thy father Telamon; who nurtured
4660,BOOK VIII.,"thee when thou wast little, and reared thee, though a bastard, in his"
4661,BOOK VIII.,"house; exalt thou him to honour, though he be afar. Moreover I will say"
4662,BOOK VIII.,to thee that which shall indeed be fulfilled. If aegis-bearing Zeus and
4663,BOOK VIII.,"Athene vouchsafe me to lay waste the stablished city of Ilios, in thine"
4664,BOOK VIII.,"hand first, after myself, will I bestow the meed of honour, be it a"
4665,BOOK VIII.,"tripod or two steeds with their chariot, or a woman that shall go up"
4666,BOOK VIII.,into thy bed.”
4667,BOOK VIII.,
4668,BOOK VIII.,And noble Teukros made answer and said to him: “Most noble son of
4669,BOOK VIII.,"Atreus, why urgest thou me that myself am eager? Verily with such"
4670,BOOK VIII.,"strength as is in me forbear I not, but ever since we drave them"
4671,BOOK VIII.,towards Ilios I watch with my bow to slay the foemen. Eight long-barbed
4672,BOOK VIII.,"arrows have I now sped, and all are buried in the flesh of young men"
4673,BOOK VIII.,swift in battle; only this mad dog can I not smite.”
4674,BOOK VIII.,
4675,BOOK VIII.,"He said, and shot another arrow from the string right against Hector;"
4676,BOOK VIII.,"and his heart was fain to smite him. Yet him he missed, but noble"
4677,BOOK VIII.,"Gorgythion, Priam’s good son, he smote with an arrow in the breast, him"
4678,BOOK VIII.,"born of a mother wedded from Aisyme, even fair Kastianeira, of favour"
4679,BOOK VIII.,like unto the gods. Even as in a garden a poppy droopeth its head
4680,BOOK VIII.,"aside, being heavy with fruit and the showers of spring; so bowed he"
4681,BOOK VIII.,aside his head laden with his helm.
4682,BOOK VIII.,
4683,BOOK VIII.,"And Teukros shot another arrow from the string, right against Hector,"
4684,BOOK VIII.,"and his heart was fain to smite him. Yet missed he once again, for"
4685,BOOK VIII.,"Apollo turned the dart away; but Archeptolemos, Hector’s bold"
4686,BOOK VIII.,"charioteer, he smote on the breast beside the nipple as he hasted into"
4687,BOOK VIII.,battle: so he fell from his car and his fleet-footed horses swerved
4688,BOOK VIII.,aside; and there his soul and spirit were unstrung. Then sore grief
4689,BOOK VIII.,"encompassed Hector’s soul for his charioteer’s sake; yet left he him,"
4690,BOOK VIII.,"though he sorrowed for his comrade, and bade Kebriones his own brother,"
4691,BOOK VIII.,"being hard by, take the chariot reins; and he heard and disregarded"
4692,BOOK VIII.,"not. And himself he leapt to earth from the resplendent car, with a"
4693,BOOK VIII.,"terrible shout; and in his hand he caught a stone, and made right at"
4694,BOOK VIII.,"Teukros, and his heart bade him smite him. Now Teukros had plucked"
4695,BOOK VIII.,"forth from his quiver a keen arrow, and laid it on the string; but even"
4696,BOOK VIII.,"as he drew it back, Hector of the glancing helm smote him with the"
4697,BOOK VIII.,"jagged stone, as he aimed eagerly against him, even beside his"
4698,BOOK VIII.,"shoulder, where the collar-bone fenceth off neck and breast, and where"
4699,BOOK VIII.,"is the most deadly spot; and he brake the bowstring,* and his hand from"
4700,BOOK VIII.,"the wrist grew numb, and he stayed fallen upon his knee, and his bow"
4701,BOOK VIII.,"dropped from his hand. But Aias disregarded not his brother’s fall, but"
4702,BOOK VIII.,ran and strode across him and hid him with his shield. Then two trusty
4703,BOOK VIII.,"comrades bent down to him, even Mekisteus son of Echios and goodly"
4704,BOOK VIII.,"Alastor, and bare him, groaning sorely, to the hollow ships. And once"
4705,BOOK VIII.,again the Olympian aroused the spirit of the Trojans. So they drove the
4706,BOOK VIII.,"Achaians straight toward the deep foss, and amid the foremost went"
4707,BOOK VIII.,Hector exulting in his strength. And even as when a hound behind wild
4708,BOOK VIII.,"boar or lion, with swift feet pursuing snatcheth at him, at flank or"
4709,BOOK VIII.,"buttock, and watcheth for him as he wheeleth, so Hector pressed hard on"
4710,BOOK VIII.,"the flowing-haired Achaians, slaying ever the hindmost, and they fled"
4711,BOOK VIII.,"on. But when they were passed in flight through palisade and foss, and"
4712,BOOK VIII.,"many were fallen beneath the Trojans’ hands, then halted they and"
4713,BOOK VIII.,"tarried beside the ships, calling one upon another, and lifting up"
4714,BOOK VIII.,their hands to all the gods prayed each one instantly. But Hector
4715,BOOK VIII.,"wheeled round his beauteous-maned steeds this way and that, and his"
4716,BOOK VIII.,eyes were as the eyes of Gorgon or Ares bane of mortals.
4717,BOOK VIII.,
4718,BOOK VIII.,* νευρήν may mean “the sinew of his arm.”
4719,BOOK VIII.,
4720,BOOK VIII.,
4721,BOOK VIII.,"Now at the sight of them the white-armed goddess Hera had compassion,"
4722,BOOK VIII.,"and anon spake winged words to Athene: “Out on it, thou child of"
4723,BOOK VIII.,"aegis-bearing Zeus, shall not we twain any more take thought for the"
4724,BOOK VIII.,"Danaans that perish, if only for this last time? Now will they fill up"
4725,BOOK VIII.,the measure of evil destiny and perish by one man’s onslaught; seeing
4726,BOOK VIII.,"that he is furious now beyond endurance, this Hector son of Priam, and"
4727,BOOK VIII.,verily hath wrought many a deed of ill.”
4728,BOOK VIII.,
4729,BOOK VIII.,"And the bright-eyed goddess Athene made answer to her, “Yea in good"
4730,BOOK VIII.,"sooth, may this fellow yield up strength and life, and perish at the"
4731,BOOK VIII.,"Argives’ hands in his native land; only mine own sire is furious, with"
4732,BOOK VIII.,"no good intent, headstrong, ever sinful, the foiler of my purposes."
4733,BOOK VIII.,Neither remembereth he at all those many times and oft that I saved his
4734,BOOK VIII.,son fordone with Eurystheus’ tasks. For he would make lament toward
4735,BOOK VIII.,"heaven, and me would Zeus speed forth from heaven to succour him. Had I"
4736,BOOK VIII.,"but known all this in my prudent heart, what time Eurystheus sent him"
4737,BOOK VIII.,"forth to the house of Hades the Warder of the Gate, to bring from"
4738,BOOK VIII.,"Erebos the hound of loathed Hades, then had he not escaped the sheer"
4739,BOOK VIII.,"stream of the water of Styx. But now Zeus hateth me, and fulfilleth the"
4740,BOOK VIII.,"purposes of Thetis, that kissed his knees and with her hand touched his"
4741,BOOK VIII.,"beard, beseeching him to do honour to Achilles waster of cities. Verily"
4742,BOOK VIII.,the day shall come when he shall call me again his bright-eyed darling.
4743,BOOK VIII.,"But now make thou ready our whole-hooved horses, while I enter into the"
4744,BOOK VIII.,"palace of aegis-bearing Zeus and gird me in my armour for battle, that"
4745,BOOK VIII.,"I may see if Priam’s son, Hector of the glancing helm, shall be glad at"
4746,BOOK VIII.,the appearing of us twain amid the highways of the battle. Surely shall
4747,BOOK VIII.,"many a Trojan likewise glut dogs and birds with fat and flesh, fallen"
4748,BOOK VIII.,dead at the ships of the Achaians.”
4749,BOOK VIII.,
4750,BOOK VIII.,"So said she, and the white-armed goddess Hera disregarded not. So Hera,"
4751,BOOK VIII.,"the goddess queen, daughter of great Kronos, went her way and harnessed"
4752,BOOK VIII.,"the golden-frontleted steeds; and Athene, daughter of aegis-bearing"
4753,BOOK VIII.,"Zeus, cast down at her father’s threshold her woven vesture"
4754,BOOK VIII.,"many-coloured, that herself had wrought and her hands had fashioned;"
4755,BOOK VIII.,"and put on her the tunic of Zeus the cloud-gatherer, and arrayed her in"
4756,BOOK VIII.,her armour for dolorous battle. Upon the flaming chariot set she her
4757,BOOK VIII.,"foot, and grasped her heavy spear great and stout, wherewith she"
4758,BOOK VIII.,"vanquisheth the ranks of men, even of heroes with whom she of the awful"
4759,BOOK VIII.,sire is wroth. Then Hera swiftly smote the horses with the lash;
4760,BOOK VIII.,self-moving groaned upon their hinges the gates of heaven whereof the
4761,BOOK VIII.,"Hours are warders, to whom is committed great heaven and Olympus,"
4762,BOOK VIII.,whether to throw open the thick cloud or set it to. There through the
4763,BOOK VIII.,gates guided they their horses patient of the lash.
4764,BOOK VIII.,
4765,BOOK VIII.,"But when father Zeus beheld from Ida, he was sore wroth, and sped Iris"
4766,BOOK VIII.,"golden-winged to bear a message: “Go thy way, fleet Iris, turn them"
4767,BOOK VIII.,back neither suffer them to face me; for in no happy wise shall we join
4768,BOOK VIII.,"in combat. For thus will I declare, and even so shall the fulfilment"
4769,BOOK VIII.,"be; I will maim their fleet horses in the chariot, and them will I hurl"
4770,BOOK VIII.,"out from the car, and will break in pieces the chariot; neither within"
4771,BOOK VIII.,the courses of ten years shall they heal them of the wounds the
4772,BOOK VIII.,thunderbolt shall tear; that the bright-eyed one may know the end when
4773,BOOK VIII.,she striveth against her father. But with Hera have I not so great
4774,BOOK VIII.,"indignation nor wrath: seeing it ever is her wont to thwart me,"
4775,BOOK VIII.,whate’er I have decreed.”
4776,BOOK VIII.,
4777,BOOK VIII.,"So said he, and whirlwind-footed Iris arose to bear the message, and"
4778,BOOK VIII.,departed from the mountains of Ida unto high Olympus. And even at the
4779,BOOK VIII.,entrance of the gates of Olympus many-folded she met them and stayed
4780,BOOK VIII.,"them, and told them the saying of Zeus: “Whither hasten ye? Why are"
4781,BOOK VIII.,your hearts furious within your breasts? Kronides forbiddeth you to
4782,BOOK VIII.,"give the Argives succour. For thus the son of Kronos threateneth, even"
4783,BOOK VIII.,"as he will fulfil; to wit, to maim your fleet horses in the chariot,"
4784,BOOK VIII.,"and you will he hurl out from the car, and break the chariot in pieces;"
4785,BOOK VIII.,neither within the courses of ten years shall ye heal you of the wounds
4786,BOOK VIII.,"that the thunderbolt shall tear; that thou, bright-eyed goddess, mayst"
4787,BOOK VIII.,know the end when thou strivest against thy father. But with Hera hath
4788,BOOK VIII.,he not so great indignation nor wrath; seeing it ever is her wont to
4789,BOOK VIII.,"thwart him, whate’er he have decreed. But most fell art thou, reckless"
4790,BOOK VIII.,vixen! if thou indeed wilt dare to lift thy huge spear against the face
4791,BOOK VIII.,of Zeus.”
4792,BOOK VIII.,
4793,BOOK VIII.,"So said fleet-footed Iris, and departed; but Hera spake to Athene and"
4794,BOOK VIII.,"said: “Out on it, thou child of aegis-bearing Zeus, I verily would no"
4795,BOOK VIII.,more have us war against Zeus for mortals’ sake. Of them let one man
4796,BOOK VIII.,"perish and another live, even as the lot falleth; and for him, let him"
4797,BOOK VIII.,"take counsel for himself in his heart, and give judgment for Trojans"
4798,BOOK VIII.,"and for Danaans, as is meet.”"
4799,BOOK VIII.,
4800,BOOK VIII.,So saying she turned back her whole-hooved horses. Then the Hours
4801,BOOK VIII.,"unyoked them their beauteous-maned horses, and tethered them to their"
4802,BOOK VIII.,"ambrosial mangers, and leant the chariots against the shining faces of"
4803,BOOK VIII.,the gateway; and the goddesses sate them upon their golden thrones amid
4804,BOOK VIII.,"the throng of all the gods, and were grieved at heart."
4805,BOOK VIII.,
4806,BOOK VIII.,And father Zeus drave from Ida his fair-wheeled chariot and horses unto
4807,BOOK VIII.,"Olympus, and came unto the session of the gods. For him also the noble"
4808,BOOK VIII.,"Shaker of Earth unyoked the steeds, and set the car upon the stand, and"
4809,BOOK VIII.,spread a cloth thereover; and far-seeing Zeus himself sate upon his
4810,BOOK VIII.,"golden throne, and beneath his feet great Olympus quaked. Only Athene"
4811,BOOK VIII.,"and Hera sate apart from Zeus, and spake no word to him neither"
4812,BOOK VIII.,"questioned him. But he was ware thereof in his heart, and said, “Why"
4813,BOOK VIII.,"are ye thus vexed, Athene and Hera? Surely ye are not wearied of making"
4814,BOOK VIII.,"havoc in glorious battle of the Trojans, for whom ye cherish bitter"
4815,BOOK VIII.,"hate! Howsoever, seeing that my might is so great and my hands"
4816,BOOK VIII.,"invincible, all the gods that are in Olympus could not turn me: and for"
4817,BOOK VIII.,"you twain, trembling erst gat hold upon your bright limbs ere that ye"
4818,BOOK VIII.,"beheld war and war’s fell deeds. For thus will I declare, and even so"
4819,BOOK VIII.,"had the fulfilment been—never had ye, once smitten with the"
4820,BOOK VIII.,"thunderbolt, fared on your chariots back unto Olympus where is the"
4821,BOOK VIII.,habitation of the immortals.”
4822,BOOK VIII.,
4823,BOOK VIII.,"So spake he, and Athene and Hera murmured, that were sitting by him and"
4824,BOOK VIII.,"devising ills for the Trojans. Now Athene held her peace, and said not"
4825,BOOK VIII.,"anything, for wrath at father Zeus, and fierce anger gat hold upon her;"
4826,BOOK VIII.,"but Hera’s heart contained not her anger, and she spake: “Most dread"
4827,BOOK VIII.,"son of Kronos, what word is this thou hast said? Well know we, even we,"
4828,BOOK VIII.,that thy might is no wise puny; yet still have we pity for the Danaan
4829,BOOK VIII.,"spearmen, that now shall perish and fill up the measure of grievous"
4830,BOOK VIII.,"fate. Yet will we refrain from battle, if thou biddest us; but counsel"
4831,BOOK VIII.,"will we offer to the Argives, such as shall profit them, that they"
4832,BOOK VIII.,perish not all at thy wrath.”
4833,BOOK VIII.,
4834,BOOK VIII.,And Zeus the cloud-gatherer answered and said: “At morn shalt thou
4835,BOOK VIII.,"behold most mighty Kronion, if thou wilt have it so, O Hera, ox-eyed"
4836,BOOK VIII.,"queen, making yet more havoc of the vast army of Argive spearmen; for"
4837,BOOK VIII.,headlong Hector shall not refrain from battle till that Peleus’ son
4838,BOOK VIII.,"fleet of foot have arisen beside the ships, that day when these shall"
4839,BOOK VIII.,"fight amid the sterns in most grievous stress, around Patroklos fallen."
4840,BOOK VIII.,"Such is the doom of heaven. And for thine anger reck I not, not even"
4841,BOOK VIII.,"though thou go to the nethermost bounds of earth and sea, where sit"
4842,BOOK VIII.,Iapetos and Kronos and have no joy in the beams of Hyperion the
4843,BOOK VIII.,"Sun-god, neither in any breeze, but deep Tartaros is round about them."
4844,BOOK VIII.,"Though thou shouldest wander till thou come even thither, yet reck I"
4845,BOOK VIII.,"not of thy vexation, seeing there is no thing more unabashed than"
4846,BOOK VIII.,thou.”
4847,BOOK VIII.,
4848,BOOK VIII.,"So said he, but white-armed Hera spake him no word. And the sun’s"
4849,BOOK VIII.,"bright light dropped into Ocean, drawing black night across Earth the"
4850,BOOK VIII.,"grain-giver. Against the Trojans’ will daylight departed, but welcome,"
4851,BOOK VIII.,"thrice prayed for, to the Achaians came down the murky night."
4852,BOOK VIII.,
4853,BOOK VIII.,"Now glorious Hector made an assembly of the Trojans, taking them apart"
4854,BOOK VIII.,"from the ships, beside the eddying river, in an open space where was"
4855,BOOK VIII.,found a spot clear of dead. And they came down from their chariots to
4856,BOOK VIII.,"the ground to hear the word that Hector, dear unto Zeus, proclaimed. He"
4857,BOOK VIII.,in his hand held his spear eleven cubits long; before his face gleamed
4858,BOOK VIII.,"the spear-head of bronze, and a ring of gold ran round about it."
4859,BOOK VIII.,"Thereon he leaned and spake to the Trojans, saying: “Hearken to me,"
4860,BOOK VIII.,Trojans and Dardanians and allies. I thought but now to make havoc of
4861,BOOK VIII.,the ships and all the Achaians and depart back again to windy Ilios;
4862,BOOK VIII.,"but dusk came too soon, and that in chief hath now saved the Argives"
4863,BOOK VIII.,and the ships beside the beach of the sea. So let us now yield to black
4864,BOOK VIII.,"night, and make our supper ready; unyoke ye from the chariots your"
4865,BOOK VIII.,"fair-maned horses, and set fodder beside them. And from the city bring"
4866,BOOK VIII.,kine and goodly sheep with speed; and provide you with honey-hearted
4867,BOOK VIII.,"wine, and corn from your houses, and gather much wood withal, that all"
4868,BOOK VIII.,"night long until early-springing dawn we may burn many fires, and the"
4869,BOOK VIII.,gleam may reach to heaven; lest perchance even by night the
4870,BOOK VIII.,flowing-haired Achaians strive to take flight over the broad back of
4871,BOOK VIII.,"the sea. Verily must they not embark upon their ships unvexed, at ease:"
4872,BOOK VIII.,"but see ye that many a one of them have a wound to nurse even at home,"
4873,BOOK VIII.,being stricken with arrow or keen-pointed spear as he leapeth upon his
4874,BOOK VIII.,ship; that so many another man may dread to wage dolorous war on the
4875,BOOK VIII.,horse-taming men of Troy. And let the heralds dear to Zeus proclaim
4876,BOOK VIII.,throughout the city that young maidens and old men of hoary heads camp
4877,BOOK VIII.,round the city on the battlements builded of the gods; and let the
4878,BOOK VIII.,women folk burn a great fire each in her hall; and let there be a sure
4879,BOOK VIII.,"watch set, lest an ambush enter the city when the host is absent. Thus"
4880,BOOK VIII.,"be it, great-hearted Trojans, as I proclaim; the counsel that now is"
4881,BOOK VIII.,"sound, let that stand spoken; further will I proclaim at dawn amid the"
4882,BOOK VIII.,horse-taming men of Troy. I pray with good hope to Zeus and all the
4883,BOOK VIII.,"gods, to drive from hence these dogs borne onward by the fates, them"
4884,BOOK VIII.,that the fates bear on in the black ships. Howbeit for the night will
4885,BOOK VIII.,"we guard our own selves, and at morn by daybreak, arrayed in our"
4886,BOOK VIII.,"armour, let us awake keen battle at the hollow ships. I will know"
4887,BOOK VIII.,whether Tydeus’ son stalwart Diomedes shall thrust me from the ships
4888,BOOK VIII.,"back to the wall, or I shall lay him low with my spear and bear away"
4889,BOOK VIII.,"his gory spoils. Tomorrow shall he prove his valour, whether he can"
4890,BOOK VIII.,"abide the onslaught of my spear. But he amid the foremost, I ween,"
4891,BOOK VIII.,"shall lie stricken, and many comrades round about their lord at the"
4892,BOOK VIII.,rising of tomorrow’s sun. Would that I were immortal and ageless all my
4893,BOOK VIII.,"days and honoured like as Athene is honoured and Apollo, so surely as"
4894,BOOK VIII.,this day bringeth the Argives ill.”
4895,BOOK VIII.,
4896,BOOK VIII.,"So Hector made harangue, and the Trojans clamoured applause. And they"
4897,BOOK VIII.,"loosed their sweating steeds from the yoke, and tethered them with"
4898,BOOK VIII.,"thongs, each man beside his chariot; and from the city they brought"
4899,BOOK VIII.,"kine and goodly sheep with speed, and provided them with honey-hearted"
4900,BOOK VIII.,"wine and corn from their houses, and gathered much wood withal; and"
4901,BOOK VIII.,sacrificed to the immortals unblemished hecatombs. And from the plain
4902,BOOK VIII.,the winds bare into heaven the sweet savour. But the blessed gods
4903,BOOK VIII.,regaled not themselves nor would they aught thereof; for sore was holy
4904,BOOK VIII.,"Ilios hated of them, and Priam and the folk of Priam of the good ashen"
4905,BOOK VIII.,spear. But these with high hopes sate them all night along the highways
4906,BOOK VIII.,"of the battle, and their watchfires burned in multitude. Even as when"
4907,BOOK VIII.,"in heaven the stars about the bright moon shine clear to see, when the"
4908,BOOK VIII.,"air is windless, and all the peaks appear and the tall headlands and"
4909,BOOK VIII.,"glades, and from heaven breaketh open the infinite air, and all stars"
4910,BOOK VIII.,"are seen, and the shepherd’s heart is glad; even in like multitude"
4911,BOOK VIII.,between the ships and the streams of Xanthos appeared the watchfires
4912,BOOK VIII.,that the Trojans kindled in front of Ilios. A thousand fires burned in
4913,BOOK VIII.,the plain and by the side of each sate fifty in the gleam of blazing
4914,BOOK VIII.,"fire. And the horses champed white barley and spelt, and standing by"
4915,BOOK VIII.,their chariots waited for the throned Dawn.
4916,BOOK VIII.,

4919,BOOK VIII.,
4920,BOOK IX.,BOOK IX.
4921,BOOK IX.,
4922,BOOK IX.,
4923,BOOK IX.,"How Agamemnon sent an embassage to Achilles, beseeching him to be"
4924,BOOK IX.,appeased; and how Achilles denied him.
4925,BOOK IX.,
4926,BOOK IX.,
4927,BOOK IX.,Thus kept the Trojans watch; but the Achaians were holden of
4928,BOOK IX.,"heaven-sent panic, handmaid of palsying fear, and all their best were"
4929,BOOK IX.,stricken to the heart with grief intolerable. Like as two winds stir up
4930,BOOK IX.,"the main, the home of fishes, even the north wind and the west wind"
4931,BOOK IX.,"that blow from Thrace, coming suddenly; and the dark billow straightway"
4932,BOOK IX.,lifteth up its crest and casteth much tangle out along the sea; even so
4933,BOOK IX.,was the Achaians’ spirit troubled in their breast.
4934,BOOK IX.,
4935,BOOK IX.,"But Atreides was stricken to the heart with sore grief, and went about"
4936,BOOK IX.,bidding the clear-voiced heralds summon every man by name to the
4937,BOOK IX.,"assembly, but not to shout aloud; and himself he toiled amid the"
4938,BOOK IX.,"foremost. So they sat sorrowful in assembly, and Agamemnon stood up"
4939,BOOK IX.,weeping like unto a fountain of dark water that from a beetling cliff
4940,BOOK IX.,poureth down its black stream; even so with deep groaning he spake amid
4941,BOOK IX.,"the Argives and said: “My friends, leaders and captains of the Argives,"
4942,BOOK IX.,Zeus son of Kronos hath bound me with might in grievous blindness of
4943,BOOK IX.,"soul; hard of heart is he, for that erewhile he promised and gave his"
4944,BOOK IX.,pledge that not till I had laid waste well-walled Ilios should I
4945,BOOK IX.,"depart, but now hath planned a cruel wile, and biddeth me return in"
4946,BOOK IX.,dishonour to Argos with the loss of many of my folk. Such meseemeth is
4947,BOOK IX.,"the good pleasure of most mighty Zeus, that hath laid low the heads of"
4948,BOOK IX.,"many cities, yea and shall lay low; for his is highest power. So come,"
4949,BOOK IX.,even as I shall bid let us all obey; let us flee with our ships to our
4950,BOOK IX.,"dear native land, for now shall we never take wide-wayed Troy.”"
4951,BOOK IX.,
4952,BOOK IX.,"So said he, and they all held their peace and kept silence. Long time"
4953,BOOK IX.,"were the sons of the Achaians voiceless for grief, but at the last"
4954,BOOK IX.,Diomedes of the loud war-cry spake amid them and said: “Atreides: with
4955,BOOK IX.,"thee first in thy folly will I contend, where it is just, O king, even"
4956,BOOK IX.,in the assembly; be not thou wroth therefor. My valour didst thou blame
4957,BOOK IX.,"in chief amid the Danaans, and saidst that I was no man of war but a"
4958,BOOK IX.,coward; and all this know the Argives both young and old. But the son
4959,BOOK IX.,of crooked-counselling Kronos hath endowed thee but by halves; he
4960,BOOK IX.,"granted thee to have the honour of the sceptre above all men, but"
4961,BOOK IX.,"valour he gave thee not, wherein is highest power. Sir, deemest thou"
4962,BOOK IX.,that the sons of the Achaians are thus indeed cowards and weaklings as
4963,BOOK IX.,"thou sayest? If thine own heart be set on departing, go thy way; the"
4964,BOOK IX.,"way is before thee, and thy ships stand beside the sea, even the great"
4965,BOOK IX.,multitude that followed thee from Mykene. But all the other
4966,BOOK IX.,"flowing-haired Achaians will tarry here until we lay waste Troy. Nay,"
4967,BOOK IX.,let them too flee on their ships to their dear native land; yet will we
4968,BOOK IX.,"twain, even I and Sthenelos, fight till we attain the goal of Ilios;"
4969,BOOK IX.,for in God’s name are we come.”
4970,BOOK IX.,
4971,BOOK IX.,"So said he, and all the sons of the Achaians shouted aloud, applauding"
4972,BOOK IX.,the saying of horse-taming Diomedes. Then knightly Nestor arose and
4973,BOOK IX.,"said amid them: “Tydeides, in battle art thou passing mighty, and in"
4974,BOOK IX.,council art thou best among thine equals in years; none of all the
4975,BOOK IX.,Achaians will make light of thy word nor gainsay it; but thou hast not
4976,BOOK IX.,"made a full end of thy words. Moreover thou art a young man indeed, and"
4977,BOOK IX.,"mightest even be my son, my youngest-born; yet thou counsellest"
4978,BOOK IX.,"prudently the princes of the Achaians, because thou speakest according"
4979,BOOK IX.,"unto right. But lo, I that avow me to be older than thou will speak"
4980,BOOK IX.,"forth and expound everything; neither shall any man despise my saying,"
4981,BOOK IX.,"not even the lord Agamemnon. A tribeless, lawless, homeless man is he"
4982,BOOK IX.,that loveth bitter civil strife. Howbeit now let us yield to black
4983,BOOK IX.,night and make ready now let us yield to black night and make ready our
4984,BOOK IX.,meal; and let the sentinels bestow them severally along the deep-delved
4985,BOOK IX.,"foss without the wall. This charge give I to the young men; and thou,"
4986,BOOK IX.,"Atreides, lead then the way, for thou art the most royal. Spread thou a"
4987,BOOK IX.,feast for the councillors; that is thy place and seemly for thee. Thy
4988,BOOK IX.,huts are full of wine that the ships of the Achaians bring thee by day
4989,BOOK IX.,"from Thrace across the wide sea; all entertainment is for thee, being"
4990,BOOK IX.,king over many. In the gathering of many shalt thou listen to him that
4991,BOOK IX.,deviseth the most excellent counsel; sore need have all the Achaians of
4992,BOOK IX.,"such as is good and prudent, because hard by the ships our foemen are"
4993,BOOK IX.,burning their watch-fires in multitude; what man can rejoice thereat?
4994,BOOK IX.,This night shall either destroy or save the host.”
4995,BOOK IX.,
4996,BOOK IX.,"So said he, and they gladly hearkened to him and obeyed. Forth sallied"
4997,BOOK IX.,"the sentinels in their harness, around Thrasymedes Nestor’s son,"
4998,BOOK IX.,"shepherd of the host, and Askalaphos and Ialmenos sons of Ares, and"
4999,BOOK IX.,Meriones and Aphareus and Deïpyros and Kreion’s son noble Lykomedes.
5000,BOOK IX.,"Seven were the captains of the sentinels, and with each went fivescore"
5001,BOOK IX.,young men bearing their long spears in their hands; and they took post
5002,BOOK IX.,"midway betwixt foss and wall, and kindled a fire and made ready each"
5003,BOOK IX.,man his meal.
5004,BOOK IX.,
5005,BOOK IX.,"Then Atreides gathered the councillors of the Achaians, and led them to"
5006,BOOK IX.,"his hut, and spread before them an abundant feast. So they put forth"
5007,BOOK IX.,their hands to the good cheer that lay before them. And when they had
5008,BOOK IX.,"put away from them the desire of meat and drink, then the old man first"
5009,BOOK IX.,"began to weave his counsel, even Nestor, whose rede of old time was"
5010,BOOK IX.,approved the best. He of good intent spake to them and said: “Most
5011,BOOK IX.,"noble son of Atreus, Agamemnon king of men, in thy name will I end and"
5012,BOOK IX.,"with thy name begin, because thou art king over many hosts, and to thy"
5013,BOOK IX.,"hand Zeus hath entrusted sceptre and law, that thou mayest take counsel"
5014,BOOK IX.,for thy folk. Thee therefore more than any it behoveth both to speak
5015,BOOK IX.,"and hearken, and to accomplish what another than thou may say, when his"
5016,BOOK IX.,heart biddeth him speak for profit: wheresoever thou leadest all shall
5017,BOOK IX.,"turn on thee, so I will speak as meseemeth best. No other man shall"
5018,BOOK IX.,have a more excellent thought than this that I bear in mind from old
5019,BOOK IX.,"time even until now, since the day when thou, O heaven-sprung king,"
5020,BOOK IX.,didst go and take the damsel Briseis from angry Achilles’ hut by no
5021,BOOK IX.,"consent of ours. Nay, I right heartily dissuaded thee; but thou"
5022,BOOK IX.,"yieldedst to thy proud spirit, and dishonouredst a man of valour whom"
5023,BOOK IX.,even the immortals honoured; for thou didst take and keepest from him
5024,BOOK IX.,his meed of valour. Still let us even now take thought how we may
5025,BOOK IX.,appease him and persuade him with gifts of friendship and kindly
5026,BOOK IX.,words.”
5027,BOOK IX.,
5028,BOOK IX.,"And Agamemnon king of men answered and said to him: “Old sir, in no"
5029,BOOK IX.,"false wise hast thou accused my folly. Fool was I, I myself deny it"
5030,BOOK IX.,"not. Worth many hosts is he whom Zeus loveth in his heart, even as now"
5031,BOOK IX.,he honoureth this man and destroyeth the host of the Achaians. But
5032,BOOK IX.,"seeing I was a fool in that I yielded to my sorry passion, I will make"
5033,BOOK IX.,amends and give a recompense beyond telling. In the midst of you all I
5034,BOOK IX.,"will name the excellent gifts; seven tripods untouched of fire, and ten"
5035,BOOK IX.,"talents of gold and twenty gleaming caldrons, and twelve stalwart"
5036,BOOK IX.,"horses, winners in the race, that have taken prizes by their speed. No"
5037,BOOK IX.,"lackwealth were that man, neither undowered of precious gold, whose"
5038,BOOK IX.,substance were as great as the prizes my whole-hooved steeds have borne
5039,BOOK IX.,"me off. And seven women will I give, skilled in excellent handiwork,"
5040,BOOK IX.,Lesbians whom I chose me from the spoils the day that he himself took
5041,BOOK IX.,"stablished Lesbos, surpassing womankind in beauty. These will I give"
5042,BOOK IX.,"him, and with them shall be she whom erst I took from him, even the"
5043,BOOK IX.,daughter of Briseus; moreover I will swear a great oath that never I
5044,BOOK IX.,went up into her bed nor had with her converse as is the wont of
5045,BOOK IX.,"mankind, even of men and women. All these things shall be set"
5046,BOOK IX.,straightway before him; and if hereafter the gods grant us to lay waste
5047,BOOK IX.,"the great city of Priam, then let him enter in when we Achaians be"
5048,BOOK IX.,"dividing the spoil, and lade his ship full of gold and bronze, and"
5049,BOOK IX.,"himself choose twenty Trojan women, the fairest that there be after"
5050,BOOK IX.,"Helen of Argos. And if we win to the richest of lands, even Achaian"
5051,BOOK IX.,"Argos, he shall be my son and I will hold him in like honour with"
5052,BOOK IX.,"Orestes, my stripling boy that is nurtured in all abundance. Three"
5053,BOOK IX.,"daughters are mine in my well-builded hall, Chrysothemis and Laodike"
5054,BOOK IX.,"and Iphianassa; let him take of them which he will, without gifts of"
5055,BOOK IX.,"wooing, to Peleus’ house; and I will add a great dower such as no man"
5056,BOOK IX.,ever yet gave with his daughter. And seven well-peopled cities will I
5057,BOOK IX.,"give him, Kardamyle and Enope and grassy Hire and holy Pherai and"
5058,BOOK IX.,"Antheia deep in meads, and fair Aipeia and Pedasos land of vines. And"
5059,BOOK IX.,"all are nigh to the salt sea, on the uttermost border of sandy Pylos;"
5060,BOOK IX.,"therein dwell men abounding in flocks and kine, men that shall worship"
5061,BOOK IX.,"him like a god with gifts, and beneath his sway fulfil his prosperous"
5062,BOOK IX.,ordinances. All this will I accomplish so he but cease from wrath. Let
5063,BOOK IX.,"him yield; Hades I ween is not to be softened neither overcome, and"
5064,BOOK IX.,"therefore is he hatefullest of all gods to mortals. Yea, let him be"
5065,BOOK IX.,"ruled by me, inasmuch as I am more royal and avow me to be the elder in"
5066,BOOK IX.,years.”
5067,BOOK IX.,
5068,BOOK IX.,Then knightly Nestor of Gerenia answered and said: “Most noble son of
5069,BOOK IX.,"Atreus, Agamemnon king of men, now are these gifts not lightly to be"
5070,BOOK IX.,"esteemed that thou offerest king Achilles. Come therefore, let us speed"
5071,BOOK IX.,forth picked men to go with all haste to the hut of Peleus’ son
5072,BOOK IX.,"Achilles. Lo now, whomsoever I appoint let them consent. First let"
5073,BOOK IX.,"Phoinix dear to Zeus lead the way, and after him great Aias and noble"
5074,BOOK IX.,Odysseus; and for heralds let Odios and Eurybates be their companions.
5075,BOOK IX.,"And now bring water for our hands, and bid keep holy silence, that we"
5076,BOOK IX.,"may pray unto Zeus the son of Kronos, if perchance he will have mercy"
5077,BOOK IX.,upon us.”
5078,BOOK IX.,
5079,BOOK IX.,"So said he, and spake words that were well-pleasing unto all. Forthwith"
5080,BOOK IX.,"the heralds poured water on their hands, and the young men crowned the"
5081,BOOK IX.,bowls with drink and gave each man his portion after they had poured
5082,BOOK IX.,the libation in the cups. And when they had made libation and drunk as
5083,BOOK IX.,"their heart desired, they issued forth from the hut of Agamemnon son of"
5084,BOOK IX.,"Atreus. And knightly Nestor of Gerenia gave them full charge, with many"
5085,BOOK IX.,"a glance to each, and chiefest to Odysseus, how they should essay to"
5086,BOOK IX.,prevail on Peleus’ noble son.
5087,BOOK IX.,
5088,BOOK IX.,"So the twain went along the shore of the loud-sounding sea, making"
5089,BOOK IX.,"instant prayer to the earth-embracer, the Shaker of the Earth, that"
5090,BOOK IX.,they might with ease prevail on Aiakides’ great heart. So they came to
5091,BOOK IX.,"the huts and ships of the Myrmidons, and found their king taking his"
5092,BOOK IX.,"pleasure of a loud lyre, fair, of curious work, with a silver cross-bar"
5093,BOOK IX.,upon it; one that he had taken from the spoils when he laid Eëtion’s
5094,BOOK IX.,"city waste. Therein he was delighting his soul, and singing the glories"
5095,BOOK IX.,"of heroes. And over against him sate Patroklos alone in silence,"
5096,BOOK IX.,watching till Aiakides should cease from singing. So the twain came
5097,BOOK IX.,"forward, and noble Odysseus led the way, and they stood before his"
5098,BOOK IX.,"face; and Achilles sprang up amazed with the lyre in his hand, and left"
5099,BOOK IX.,"the seat where he was sitting, and in like manner Patroklos when he"
5100,BOOK IX.,beheld the men arose. Then Achilles fleet of foot greeted them and
5101,BOOK IX.,said: “Welcome; verily ye are friends that are come—sore indeed is the
5102,BOOK IX.,need—even ye that are dearest of the Achaians to me even in my wrath.”
5103,BOOK IX.,
5104,BOOK IX.,"So spake noble Achilles and led them forward, and made them sit on"
5105,BOOK IX.,settles and carpets of purple; and anon he spake to Patroklos being
5106,BOOK IX.,"near: “Bring forth a greater bowl, thou son of Menoitios; mingle"
5107,BOOK IX.,"stronger drink, and prepare each man a cup, for dearest of men are"
5108,BOOK IX.,these that are under my roof.”
5109,BOOK IX.,
5110,BOOK IX.,"So said he, and Patroklos hearkened to his dear comrade. He cast down a"
5111,BOOK IX.,"great fleshing-block in the fire-light, and laid thereon a sheep’s back"
5112,BOOK IX.,"and a fat goat’s, and a great hog’s chine rich with fat. And Automedon"
5113,BOOK IX.,"held them for him, while Achilles carved. Then he sliced well the meat"
5114,BOOK IX.,"and pierced it through with spits, and Menoitios’ son, that godlike"
5115,BOOK IX.,"hero, made the fire burn high. Then when the fire was burned down and"
5116,BOOK IX.,"the flame waned, he scattered the embers and laid the spits thereover,"
5117,BOOK IX.,"resting them on the spit-racks, when he had sprinkled them with holy"
5118,BOOK IX.,salt. Then when he had roasted the meat and apportioned it in the
5119,BOOK IX.,"platters, Patroklos took bread and dealt it forth on the table in fair"
5120,BOOK IX.,"baskets, and Achilles dealt the meat. And he sate him over against"
5121,BOOK IX.,"godlike Odysseus by the other wall, and bade his comrade Patroklos do"
5122,BOOK IX.,sacrifice to the gods; so he cast the first-fruits into the fire. Then
5123,BOOK IX.,put they forth their hands to the good cheer lying before them. And
5124,BOOK IX.,"when they had put from them the desire of meat and drink, Aias nodded"
5125,BOOK IX.,"to Phoinix. But noble Odysseus marked it, and filled a cup with wine"
5126,BOOK IX.,"and pledged Achilles: “Hail, O Achilles! The fair feast lack we not"
5127,BOOK IX.,either in the hut of Agamemnon son of Atreus neither now in thine; for
5128,BOOK IX.,"feasting is there abundance to our heart’s desire, but our thought is"
5129,BOOK IX.,"not for matters of the delicious feast; nay, we behold very sore"
5130,BOOK IX.,"destruction, thou fosterling of Zeus, and are afraid. Now is it in"
5131,BOOK IX.,"doubt whether we save the benched ships or behold them perish, if thou"
5132,BOOK IX.,put not on thy might. Nigh unto ships and wall have the high-hearted
5133,BOOK IX.,"Trojans and famed allies pitched their camp, and kindled many fires"
5134,BOOK IX.,"throughout their host, and ween that they shall no more be withheld but"
5135,BOOK IX.,will fall on our black ships. And Zeus son of Kronos sheweth them signs
5136,BOOK IX.,"upon the right by lightning, and Hector greatly exulteth in his might"
5137,BOOK IX.,"and rageth furiously, trusting in Zeus, and recketh not of god nor man,"
5138,BOOK IX.,for mighty madness hath possessed him. He prayeth bright Dawn to shine
5139,BOOK IX.,"forth with all speed, for he bath passed his word to smite off from the"
5140,BOOK IX.,"ships the ensigns’ tops, and to fire the hulls with devouring flame,"
5141,BOOK IX.,and hard thereby to make havoc of the Achaians confounded by the smoke.
5142,BOOK IX.,Therefore am I sore afraid in my heart lest the gods fulfil his
5143,BOOK IX.,"boastings, and it be fated for us to perish here in Troy-land, far from"
5144,BOOK IX.,Argos pasture-land of horses. Up then! if thou art minded even at the
5145,BOOK IX.,last to save the failing sons of the Achaians from the war-din of the
5146,BOOK IX.,"Trojans. Thyself shalt have grief hereafter, and when the ill is done"
5147,BOOK IX.,is there no way to find a cure therefor; in good time rather take thou
5148,BOOK IX.,"thought to ward the evil day from the Danaans. Friend, surely to thee"
5149,BOOK IX.,thy father Peleus gave commandment the day he sent thee to Agamemnon
5150,BOOK IX.,"forth from Phthia: ‘My son, strength shall Athene and Hera give thee if"
5151,BOOK IX.,"they will; but do thou refrain thy proud soul in thy breast, for"
5152,BOOK IX.,gentlemindedness is the better part; and withdraw from mischievous
5153,BOOK IX.,"strife, that so the Argives may honour thee the more, both young and"
5154,BOOK IX.,"old.’ Thus the old man charged thee, but thou forgettest. Yet cease now"
5155,BOOK IX.,"at the last, and eschew thy grievous wrath; Agamemnon offereth thee"
5156,BOOK IX.,"worthy gifts, so thou wilt cease from anger. Lo now, hearken thou to"
5157,BOOK IX.,"me, and I will tell thee all the gifts that in his hut Agamemnon"
5158,BOOK IX.,"promised thee: seven tripods untouched of fire, and ten talents of gold"
5159,BOOK IX.,"and twenty gleaming caldrons and twelve stalwart horses, winners in the"
5160,BOOK IX.,"race, that have taken prizes by their speed. No lackwealth were that"
5161,BOOK IX.,"man, neither undowered of precious gold, whose substance were as great"
5162,BOOK IX.,as the prizes Agamemnon’s steeds have borne him off. And seven women
5163,BOOK IX.,"will he give, skilled in excellent handiwork, Lesbians whom he chose"
5164,BOOK IX.,"him from the spoils the day that thou thyself tookest Lesbos,"
5165,BOOK IX.,"surpassing womankind in beauty. These will he give thee, and with them"
5166,BOOK IX.,"shall be she whom erst he took from thee, even the daughter of Briseus;"
5167,BOOK IX.,moreover he will swear a great oath that never he went up into her bed
5168,BOOK IX.,"nor had with her converse as is the wont of mankind, O king, even of"
5169,BOOK IX.,men and women. All these things shall be set straightway before thee;
5170,BOOK IX.,and if hereafter the gods grant us to lay waste the great city of
5171,BOOK IX.,"Priam, then enter thou in when we Achaians be dividing the spoil, and"
5172,BOOK IX.,"lade thy ship full of gold and bronze, and thyself choose twenty Trojan"
5173,BOOK IX.,"women, the fairest that there be after Helen of Argos. And if we win to"
5174,BOOK IX.,"the richest of lands, even Achaian Argos, thou shalt be his son and he"
5175,BOOK IX.,"will hold thee in like honour with Orestes, his stripling boy that is"
5176,BOOK IX.,nurtured in all abundance. Three daughters are his in his well-builded
5177,BOOK IX.,"hall, Chrysothemis and Laodike and Iphianassa; take thou of them which"
5178,BOOK IX.,"thou wilt, without gifts of wooing, to Peleus’ house; and he will add a"
5179,BOOK IX.,great dower such as no man ever yet gave with his daughter. And seven
5180,BOOK IX.,"well-peopled cities will he give thee, Kardamyle and Enope and grassy"
5181,BOOK IX.,"Hire and holy Pherai and Antheia deep in meads, and fair Aipeia and"
5182,BOOK IX.,"Pedasos land of vines. And all are nigh to the sea, on the uttermost"
5183,BOOK IX.,"border of sandy Pylos; therein dwell men abounding in flocks and kine,"
5184,BOOK IX.,"men that shall worship thee like a god with gifts, and beneath thy sway"
5185,BOOK IX.,fulfil thy prosperous ordinances. All this will he accomplish so thou
5186,BOOK IX.,"but cease from wrath. But and if Agamemnon be too hateful to thy heart,"
5187,BOOK IX.,"both he and his gifts, yet have thou pity on all the Achaians that"
5188,BOOK IX.,"faint throughout the host; these shall honour thee as a god, for verily"
5189,BOOK IX.,thou wilt earn exceeding great glory at their hands. Yea now mightest
5190,BOOK IX.,"thou slay Hector, for he would come very near thee in his deadly"
5191,BOOK IX.,"madness, because he deemeth that there is no man like unto him among"
5192,BOOK IX.,the Danaans that the ships brought hither.”
5193,BOOK IX.,
5194,BOOK IX.,And Achilles fleet of foot answered and said unto him: “Heaven-sprung
5195,BOOK IX.,"son of Laertes, Odysseus of many wiles, in openness must I now declare"
5196,BOOK IX.,"unto you my saying, even as I am minded and as the fulfilment thereof"
5197,BOOK IX.,"shall be, that ye may not sit before me and coax this way and that. For"
5198,BOOK IX.,hateful to me even as the gates of hell is he that hideth one thing in
5199,BOOK IX.,his heart and uttereth another: but I will speak what meseemeth best.
5200,BOOK IX.,"Not me, I ween, shall Agamemnon son of Atreus persuade, nor the other"
5201,BOOK IX.,"Danaans, seeing we were to have no thank for battling with the foemen"
5202,BOOK IX.,ever without respite. He that abideth at home hath equal share with him
5203,BOOK IX.,"that fighteth his best, and in like honour are held both the coward and"
5204,BOOK IX.,the brave; death cometh alike to the untoiling and to him that hath
5205,BOOK IX.,toiled long. Neither have I any profit for that I endured tribulation
5206,BOOK IX.,"of soul, ever staking my life in fight. Even as a hen bringeth her"
5207,BOOK IX.,"unfledged chickens each morsel as she winneth it, and with herself it"
5208,BOOK IX.,"goeth hard, even so I was wont to watch out many a sleepless night and"
5209,BOOK IX.,"pass through many bloody days of battle, warring with folk for their"
5210,BOOK IX.,"women’s sake. Twelve cities of men have I laid waste from ship-board,"
5211,BOOK IX.,"and from land eleven, I do you to wit, throughout deep-soiled"
5212,BOOK IX.,Troy-land; out of all these took I many goodly treasures and would
5213,BOOK IX.,"bring and give them all to Agamemnon son of Atreus, and he staying"
5214,BOOK IX.,behind amid the fleet ships would take them and portion out some few
5215,BOOK IX.,but keep the most. Now some he gave to be meeds of honour to the
5216,BOOK IX.,"princes and the kings, and theirs are left untouched; only from me of"
5217,BOOK IX.,all the Achaians took he my darling lady and keepeth her—let him sleep
5218,BOOK IX.,beside her and take his joy! But why must the Argives make war on the
5219,BOOK IX.,Trojans? why hath Atreides gathered his host and led them hither? is it
5220,BOOK IX.,not for lovely-haired Helen’s sake? Do then the sons of Atreus alone of
5221,BOOK IX.,mortal men love their wives? surely whatsoever man is good and sound of
5222,BOOK IX.,"mind loveth his own and cherisheth her, even as I too loved mine with"
5223,BOOK IX.,"all my heart, though but the captive of my spear. But now that he hath"
5224,BOOK IX.,"taken my meed of honour from mine arms and hath deceived me, let him"
5225,BOOK IX.,"not tempt me that know him full well; he shall not prevail. Nay,"
5226,BOOK IX.,"Odysseus, let him take counsel with thee and all the princes to ward"
5227,BOOK IX.,from the ships the consuming fire. Verily without mine aid he hath
5228,BOOK IX.,"wrought many things, and built a wall and dug a foss about it wide and"
5229,BOOK IX.,"deep, and set a palisade therein; yet even so can he not stay murderous"
5230,BOOK IX.,"Hector’s might. But so long as I was fighting amid the Achaians, Hector"
5231,BOOK IX.,"had no mind to array his battle far from the wall, but scarce came unto"
5232,BOOK IX.,the Skaian gates and to the oak-tree; there once he awaited me alone
5233,BOOK IX.,"and scarce escaped my onset. But now, seeing I have no mind to fight"
5234,BOOK IX.,"with noble Hector, I will to-morrow do sacrifice to Zeus and all the"
5235,BOOK IX.,"gods, and store well my ships when I have launched them on the salt"
5236,BOOK IX.,"sea—then shalt thou see, if thou wilt and hast any care therefor, my"
5237,BOOK IX.,"ships sailing at break of day over Hellespont, the fishes’ home, and my"
5238,BOOK IX.,men right eager at the oar; and if the great Shaker of the Earth grant
5239,BOOK IX.,"me good journey, on the third day should I reach deep-soiled Phthia."
5240,BOOK IX.,There are my great possessions that I left when I came hither to my
5241,BOOK IX.,"hurt; and yet more gold and ruddy bronze shall I bring from hence, and"
5242,BOOK IX.,"fair-girdled women and grey iron, all at least that were mine by lot;"
5243,BOOK IX.,only my meed of honour hath he that gave it me taken back in his
5244,BOOK IX.,"despitefulness, even lord Agamemnon son of Atreus. To him declare ye"
5245,BOOK IX.,"everything even as I charge you, openly, that all the Achaians likewise"
5246,BOOK IX.,"may have indignation, if haply he hopeth to beguile yet some other"
5247,BOOK IX.,"Danaan, for that he is ever clothed in shamelessness. Verily not in my"
5248,BOOK IX.,"face would he dare to look, though he have the front of a dog. Neither"
5249,BOOK IX.,"will I devise counsel with him nor any enterprise, for utterly he hath"
5250,BOOK IX.,deceived me and done wickedly; but never again shall he beguile me with
5251,BOOK IX.,fair speech—let this suffice him. Let him begone in peace; Zeus the
5252,BOOK IX.,"lord of counsel hath taken away his wits. Hateful to me are his gifts,"
5253,BOOK IX.,"and I hold him at a straw’s worth. Not even if he gave me ten times,"
5254,BOOK IX.,"yea twenty, all that now is his, and all that may come to him"
5255,BOOK IX.,"otherwhence, even all the revenue of Orchomenos or Egyptian Thebes"
5256,BOOK IX.,where the treasure-houses are stored fullest—Thebes of the hundred
5257,BOOK IX.,"gates, whence sally forth two hundred warriors through each with horses"
5258,BOOK IX.,"and chariots—nay, nor gifts in number as sand or dust; not even so"
5259,BOOK IX.,shall Agamemnon persuade my soul till he have paid me back all the
5260,BOOK IX.,bitter despite. And the daughter of Agamemnon son of Atreus will I not
5261,BOOK IX.,"wed, not were she rival of golden Aphrodite for fairness and for"
5262,BOOK IX.,handiwork matched bright-eyed Athene—not even then will I wed her; let
5263,BOOK IX.,him choose him of the Achaians another that is his peer and is more
5264,BOOK IX.,royal than I. For if the gods indeed preserve me and I come unto my
5265,BOOK IX.,"home, then will Peleus himself seek me a wife. Many Achaian maidens are"
5266,BOOK IX.,"there throughout Hellas and Phthia, daughters of princes that ward"
5267,BOOK IX.,their cities; whomsoever of these I wish will I make my dear lady. Very
5268,BOOK IX.,"often was my high soul moved to take me there a wedded wife, a help"
5269,BOOK IX.,"meet for me, and have joy of the possessions that the old man Peleus"
5270,BOOK IX.,possesseth. For not of like worth with life hold I even all the wealth
5271,BOOK IX.,that men say was possessed of the well-peopled city of Ilios in days of
5272,BOOK IX.,"peace gone by, before the sons of the Achaians came; neither all the"
5273,BOOK IX.,treasure that the stone threshold of the archer Phoebus Apollo
5274,BOOK IX.,encompasseth in rocky Pytho. For kine and goodly flocks are to be had
5275,BOOK IX.,"for the harrying, and tripods and chestnut horses for the purchasing;"
5276,BOOK IX.,but to bring back man’s life neither harrying nor earning availeth when
5277,BOOK IX.,once it hath passed the barrier of his lips. For thus my goddess mother
5278,BOOK IX.,"telleth me, Thetis the silver-footed, that twain fates are bearing me"
5279,BOOK IX.,"to the issue of death. If I abide here and besiege the Trojans’ city,"
5280,BOOK IX.,"then my returning home is taken from me, but my fame shall be"
5281,BOOK IX.,"imperishable; but if I go home to my dear native land, my high fame is"
5282,BOOK IX.,"taken from me, but my life shall endure long while, neither shall the"
5283,BOOK IX.,issue of death soon reach me. Moreover I would counsel you all to set
5284,BOOK IX.,"sail homeward, seeing ye shall never reach your goal of steep Ilios; of"
5285,BOOK IX.,a surety far-seeing Zeus holdeth his hand over her and her folk are of
5286,BOOK IX.,good courage. So go your way and tell my answer to the princes of the
5287,BOOK IX.,"Achaians, even as is the office of elders, that they may devise in"
5288,BOOK IX.,"their hearts some other better counsel, such as shall save them their"
5289,BOOK IX.,ships and the host of the Achaians amid the hollow ships: since this
5290,BOOK IX.,"counsel availeth them naught that they have now devised, by reason of"
5291,BOOK IX.,"my fierce wrath. But let Phoinix now abide with us and lay him to rest,"
5292,BOOK IX.,that he may follow with me on my ships to our dear native land
5293,BOOK IX.,"to-morrow, if he will; for I will not take him perforce.”"
5294,BOOK IX.,
5295,BOOK IX.,"So spake he, and they all held their peace and were still, and"
5296,BOOK IX.,marvelled at his saying; for he denied them very vehemently. But at the
5297,BOOK IX.,"last spake to them the old knight Phoinix, bursting into tears, because"
5298,BOOK IX.,he was sore afraid for the ships of the Achaians: “If indeed thou
5299,BOOK IX.,"ponderest departure in thy heart, glorious Achilles, and hast no mind"
5300,BOOK IX.,"at all to save the fleet ships from consuming fire, because that wrath"
5301,BOOK IX.,"hath entered into thy heart; how can I be left of thee, dear son, alone"
5302,BOOK IX.,thereafter? To thee did the old knight Peleus send me the day he sent
5303,BOOK IX.,"thee to Agamemnon forth from Phthia, a stripling yet unskilled in equal"
5304,BOOK IX.,war and in debate wherein men wax pre-eminent. Therefore sent he me to
5305,BOOK IX.,"teach thee all these things, to be both a speaker of words and a doer"
5306,BOOK IX.,"of deeds. So would I not be left alone of thee, dear son, not even if"
5307,BOOK IX.,"god himself should take on him to strip my years from me, and make me"
5308,BOOK IX.,fresh and young as in the day when first I left Hellas the home of fair
5309,BOOK IX.,"women, fleeing from strife against my father Amyntor son of Ormenos:"
5310,BOOK IX.,for he was sore angered with me by reason of his lovely-haired
5311,BOOK IX.,"concubine, whom he ever cherished and wronged his wife my mother. So"
5312,BOOK IX.,she besought me continually by my knees to go in first unto the
5313,BOOK IX.,"concubine, that the old man might be hateful to her. I hearkened to her"
5314,BOOK IX.,and did the deed; but my sire was ware thereof forthwith and cursed me
5315,BOOK IX.,"mightily, and called the dire Erinyes to look that never should any"
5316,BOOK IX.,dear son sprung of my body sit upon my* knees: and the gods fulfilled
5317,BOOK IX.,"his curse, even Zeus of the underworld and dread Persephone. [Then took"
5318,BOOK IX.,I counsel to slay him with the keen sword; but some immortal stayed
5319,BOOK IX.,"mine anger, bringing to my mind the people’s voice and all the"
5320,BOOK IX.,"reproaches of men, lest I should be called a father-slayer amid the"
5321,BOOK IX.,Achaians.] Then would my soul no more be refrained at all within my
5322,BOOK IX.,breast to tarry in the halls of mine angered father. Now my fellows and
5323,BOOK IX.,"my kinsmen came about me with many prayers, and refrained me there"
5324,BOOK IX.,"within the halls, and slaughtered many goodly sheep and shambling kine"
5325,BOOK IX.,with crooked horns; and many swine rich with fat were stretched to
5326,BOOK IX.,"singe over the flames of Hephaistos, and wine from that old man’s jars"
5327,BOOK IX.,was drunken without stint. Nine nights long slept they all night around
5328,BOOK IX.,"my body; they kept watch in turn, neither were the fires quenched, one"
5329,BOOK IX.,beneath the colonnade of the fenced courtyard and another in the porch
5330,BOOK IX.,before the chamber doors. But when the tenth dark night was come upon
5331,BOOK IX.,"me, then burst I my cunningly fitted chamber doors, and issued forth"
5332,BOOK IX.,"and overleapt the courtyard fence lightly, unmarked of watchmen and"
5333,BOOK IX.,"handmaidens. Then fled I far through Hellas of wide lawns, and came to"
5334,BOOK IX.,"deep-soiled Phthia, mother of flocks, even unto king Peleus; and he"
5335,BOOK IX.,received me kindly and cherished me as a father cherisheth his only
5336,BOOK IX.,"son, his stripling heir of great possessions; and he made me rich and"
5337,BOOK IX.,"gave much people to me, and I dwelt in the uttermost part of Phthia and"
5338,BOOK IX.,"was king over the Dolopians. Yea, I reared thee to this greatness, thou"
5339,BOOK IX.,"godlike Achilles, with my heart’s love; for with none other wouldest"
5340,BOOK IX.,"thou go unto the feast, neither take meat in the hall, till that I had"
5341,BOOK IX.,set thee upon my knees and stayed thee with the savoury morsel cut
5342,BOOK IX.,"first for thee, and put the wine-cup to thy lips. Oft hast thou stained"
5343,BOOK IX.,the doublet on my breast with sputtering of wine in thy sorry
5344,BOOK IX.,"helplessness. Thus I suffered much with thee and much I toiled, being"
5345,BOOK IX.,mindful that the gods in nowise created any issue of my body; but I
5346,BOOK IX.,"made thee my son, thou godlike Achilles, that thou mayest yet save me"
5347,BOOK IX.,"from grievous destruction. Therefore, Achilles, rule thy high spirit;"
5348,BOOK IX.,"neither beseemeth it thee to have a ruthless heart. Nay, even the very"
5349,BOOK IX.,"gods can bend, and theirs withal is loftier majesty and honour and"
5350,BOOK IX.,might. Their hearts by incense and reverent vows and drink-offering and
5351,BOOK IX.,"burnt-offering men turn with prayer, so oft as any transgresseth and"
5352,BOOK IX.,"doeth sin. Moreover Prayers of penitence are daughters of great Zeus,"
5353,BOOK IX.,"halting and wrinkled and of eyes askance, that have their task withal"
5354,BOOK IX.,"to go in the steps of Sin. For Sin is strong and fleet of foot,"
5355,BOOK IX.,"wherefore she far outrunneth all prayers, and goeth before them over"
5356,BOOK IX.,"all the earth making men fall, and Prayers follow behind to heal the"
5357,BOOK IX.,"harm. Now whosoever reverenceth Zeus’ daughters when they draw near,"
5358,BOOK IX.,him they greatly bless and hear his petitions; but when one denieth
5359,BOOK IX.,"them and stiffly refuseth, then depart they and make prayer unto Zeus"
5360,BOOK IX.,"the son of Kronos that sin may come upon such an one, that he may fall"
5361,BOOK IX.,"and pay the price. Nay, Achilles, look thou too that there attend upon"
5362,BOOK IX.,the daughters of Zeus the reverence that bendeth the heart of all men
5363,BOOK IX.,that be right-minded. For if Atreides brought thee not gifts and
5364,BOOK IX.,"foretold thee not more hereafter, but were ever furiously wroth, then I"
5365,BOOK IX.,were not he that should bid thee cast aside thine anger and save the
5366,BOOK IX.,"Argives, even in their sore need of thee. But now he both offereth thee"
5367,BOOK IX.,"forthwith many gifts, and promiseth thee more hereafter, and hath sent"
5368,BOOK IX.,"heroes to beseech thee, the best men chosen throughout the host of the"
5369,BOOK IX.,Achaians and that to thyself are dearest of the Argives; dishonour not
5370,BOOK IX.,thou their petition nor their journey hither; though erst it were no
5371,BOOK IX.,wrong that thou wast wroth. Even in like manner have we heard the fame
5372,BOOK IX.,"of those heroes that were of old, as oft as furious anger came on any;"
5373,BOOK IX.,they might be won by gifts and prevailed upon by speech. This tale have
5374,BOOK IX.,"I in mind of old time and not of yesterday, even as it was; and I will"
5375,BOOK IX.,tell it among you that all are friends. The Kuretes** fought and the
5376,BOOK IX.,"staunch Aitolians about the city of Kalydon, and slew one another, the"
5377,BOOK IX.,"Aitolians defending lovely Kalydon, the Kuretes eager to lay it waste"
5378,BOOK IX.,in war. For Artemis of the golden throne had brought a plague upon
5379,BOOK IX.,"them, in wrath that Oineus offered her not the harvest first-fruits on"
5380,BOOK IX.,the fat of his garden land; for all the other gods had their feast of
5381,BOOK IX.,"hecatombs, and only to the daughter of great Zeus offered he not,"
5382,BOOK IX.,whether he forgat or marked it not; and therein sinned he sore in his
5383,BOOK IX.,heart. So the Archer-goddess was wroth and sent against him a creature
5384,BOOK IX.,"of heaven, a fierce wild boar, white-tusked, that wrought sore ill"
5385,BOOK IX.,continually on Oineus’ garden land; many a tall tree laid he low
5386,BOOK IX.,"utterly, even root and apple blossom therewith. But him slew Meleagros"
5387,BOOK IX.,"the son of Oineus, having gathered together from many cities huntsmen"
5388,BOOK IX.,"and hounds; for not of few men could the boar be slain, so mighty was"
5389,BOOK IX.,he; and many an one brought he to the grievous pyre. But the goddess
5390,BOOK IX.,made much turmoil over him and tumult concerning the boar’s head and
5391,BOOK IX.,"shaggy hide, between the Kuretes and great-hearted Aitolians. Now so"
5392,BOOK IX.,"long as Meleagros dear to Ares fought, so long it went ill with the"
5393,BOOK IX.,"Kuretes, neither dared they face him without their city walls, for all"
5394,BOOK IX.,"they were very many. But when Meleagros grew full of wrath, such as"
5395,BOOK IX.,"swelleth the hearts of others likewise in their breasts, though they be"
5396,BOOK IX.,"wise of mind, then in anger of heart at his dear mother Althaia he"
5397,BOOK IX.,"tarried beside his wedded wife, fair Kleopatra, daughter of Marpessa"
5398,BOOK IX.,"fair-ankled daughter of Euenos, and of Ides that was strongest of men"
5399,BOOK IX.,that were then upon the earth; he it was that took the bow to face the
5400,BOOK IX.,king Phoebus Apollo for sake of the fair-ankled damsel***. And she was
5401,BOOK IX.,"called Alkyone of her father and lady mother by surname in their hall,"
5402,BOOK IX.,because her mother in the plight of the plaintive halcyon-bird wept
5403,BOOK IX.,when the far-darter Phoebus Apollo snatched her away. By her side lay
5404,BOOK IX.,"Meleagros, brooding on his grievous anger, being wroth by reason of his"
5405,BOOK IX.,"mother’s curses: for she, grieved for her brethren’s death, prayed"
5406,BOOK IX.,"instantly to the gods, and with her hands likewise beat instantly upon"
5407,BOOK IX.,"the fertile earth, calling on Hades and dread Persephone, while she"
5408,BOOK IX.,"knelt upon her knees and made her bosom wet with tears, to bring her"
5409,BOOK IX.,"son to death; and Erinnys that walketh in darkness, whose heart knoweth"
5410,BOOK IX.,"not ruth, heard her from Erebos, Now was the din of foemen about their"
5411,BOOK IX.,"gates quickly risen, and a noise of battering of towers; and the elders"
5412,BOOK IX.,of the Aitolians sent the best of the gods’ priests and besought him to
5413,BOOK IX.,"come forth and save them, with promise of a mighty gift; to wit, they"
5414,BOOK IX.,"bade him, where the plain of lovely Kalydon was fattest, to choose him"
5415,BOOK IX.,"out a fair demesne of fifty plough-gates, the half thereof vine-land"
5416,BOOK IX.,"and the half open plough-land, to be cut from out the plain. And old"
5417,BOOK IX.,"knightly Oineus prayed him instantly, and stood upon the threshold of"
5418,BOOK IX.,"his high-roofed chamber, and shook the morticed doors to beseech his"
5419,BOOK IX.,son; him too his sisters and his lady mother prayed instantly—but he
5420,BOOK IX.,"denied them yet more—instantly too his comrades prayed, that were"
5421,BOOK IX.,nearest him and dearest of all men. Yet even so persuaded they not his
5422,BOOK IX.,"heart within his breast, until his chamber was now hotly battered and"
5423,BOOK IX.,the Kuretes were climbing upon the towers and firing the great city.
5424,BOOK IX.,"Then did his fair-girdled wife pray Meleagros with lamentation, and"
5425,BOOK IX.,told him all the woes that come on men whose city is taken; the
5426,BOOK IX.,"warriors are slain, and the city is wasted of fire, and the children"
5427,BOOK IX.,and the deep-girdled women are led captive of strangers. And his soul
5428,BOOK IX.,"was stirred to hear the grievous tale, and he went his way and donned"
5429,BOOK IX.,"his glittering armour. So he saved the Aitolians from the evil day,"
5430,BOOK IX.,obeying his own will; but they paid him not now the gifts many and
5431,BOOK IX.,gracious; yet nevertheless he drave away destruction. But be not thine
5432,BOOK IX.,"heart thus minded, neither let heaven so guide thee, dear son; that"
5433,BOOK IX.,"were a hard thing, to save the ships already burning. Nay, come for the"
5434,BOOK IX.,gifts; the Achaians shall honour thee even as a god. But if without
5435,BOOK IX.,"gifts thou enter into battle the bane of men, thou wilt not be held in"
5436,BOOK IX.,"like honour, even though thou avert the fray.”"

5447,BOOK IX.,And Achilles fleet of foot made answer and said to him: “Phoinix my
5448,BOOK IX.,"father, thou old man fosterling of Zeus, such honour need I in no wise;"
5449,BOOK IX.,"for I deem that I have been honoured by the judgment of Zeus, which"
5450,BOOK IX.,shall abide upon me amid my beaked ships as long as breath tarrieth in
5451,BOOK IX.,my body and my limbs are strong. Moreover I will say this thing to thee
5452,BOOK IX.,and lay thou it to thine heart; trouble not my soul by weeping and
5453,BOOK IX.,"lamentation, to do the pleasure of warrior Atreides; neither beseemeth"
5454,BOOK IX.,"it thee to cherish him, lest thou be hated of me that cherish thee. It"
5455,BOOK IX.,were good that thou with me shouldest vex him that vexeth me. Be thou
5456,BOOK IX.,"king even as I, and share my sway by halves, but these shall bear my"
5457,BOOK IX.,"message. So tarry thou here and lay thee to rest in a soft bed, and"
5458,BOOK IX.,"with break of day will we consider whether to depart unto our own, or"
5459,BOOK IX.,to abide.”
5460,BOOK IX.,
5461,BOOK IX.,"He spake, and nodded his brow in silence unto Patroklos to spread for"
5462,BOOK IX.,"Phoinix a thick couch, that the others might bethink them to depart"
5463,BOOK IX.,"from the hut with speed. Then spake to them Aias, Telamon’s godlike"
5464,BOOK IX.,"son, and said: “Heaven-sprung son of Laertes, Odysseus of many wiles,"
5465,BOOK IX.,let us go hence; for methinks the purpose of our charge will not by
5466,BOOK IX.,"this journey be accomplished; and we must tell the news, though it be"
5467,BOOK IX.,"no wise good, with all speed unto the Danaans, that now sit awaiting."
5468,BOOK IX.,But Achilles hath wrought his proud soul to fury within him—stubborn
5469,BOOK IX.,"man, that recketh naught of his comrades’ love, wherein we worshipped"
5470,BOOK IX.,him beyond all men amid the ships—unmerciful! Yet doth a man accept
5471,BOOK IX.,recompense of his brother’s murderer or for his dead son; and so the
5472,BOOK IX.,"man-slayer for a great price abideth in his own land, and the kinsman’s"
5473,BOOK IX.,"heart is appeased, and his proud soul, when he hath taken the"
5474,BOOK IX.,"recompense. But for thee, the gods have put within thy breast a spirit"
5475,BOOK IX.,"implacable and evil, by reason of one single damsel. And now we offer"
5476,BOOK IX.,"thee seven damsels, far best of all, and many other gifts besides;"
5477,BOOK IX.,"entertain thou then a kindly spirit, and have respect unto thine home;"
5478,BOOK IX.,"because we are guests of thy roof, sent of the multitude of Danaans,"
5479,BOOK IX.,and we would fain be nearest to thee and dearest beyond all other
5480,BOOK IX.,"Achaians, as many as there be.”"
5481,BOOK IX.,
5482,BOOK IX.,And Achilles fleet of foot made answer and said to him: “Aias sprung of
5483,BOOK IX.,"Zeus, thou son of Telamon, prince of the folk, thou seemest to speak"
5484,BOOK IX.,all this almost after mine own mind; but my heart swelleth with wrath
5485,BOOK IX.,"as oft as I bethink me of those things, how Atreides entreated me"
5486,BOOK IX.,"arrogantly among the Argives, as though I were some worthless"
5487,BOOK IX.,sojourner. But go ye and declare my message; I will not take thought of
5488,BOOK IX.,"bloody war until that wise Priam’s son, noble Hector, come to the"
5489,BOOK IX.,"Myrmidons’ huts and ships, slaying the Argives, and smirch the ships"
5490,BOOK IX.,"with fire. But about mine hut and black ship I ween that Hector, though"
5491,BOOK IX.,"he be very eager for battle, shall be refrained.”"
5492,BOOK IX.,
5493,BOOK IX.,"So said he, and they took each man a two-handled cup, and made libation"
5494,BOOK IX.,and went back along the line of ships; and Odysseus led the way. And
5495,BOOK IX.,Patroklos bade his fellows and handmaidens spread with all speed a
5496,BOOK IX.,thick couch for Phoinix; and they obeyed and spread a couch as he
5497,BOOK IX.,"ordained, fleeces and rugs and fine flock of linen. Then the old man"
5498,BOOK IX.,laid him down and tarried for bright Dawn. And Achilles slept in the
5499,BOOK IX.,"corner of the morticed hut, and by his side lay a woman that he brought"
5500,BOOK IX.,"from Lesbos, even Phorbas’ daughter fair-cheeked Diomede. And on the"
5501,BOOK IX.,"other side Patroklos lay, and by his side likewise fair-girdled Iphis,"
5502,BOOK IX.,"whom noble Achilles gave him at the taking of steep Skyros, the city of"
5503,BOOK IX.,Enyeus.
5504,BOOK IX.,
5505,BOOK IX.,
5506,BOOK IX.,"Now when those were come unto Atreides’ huts, the sons of the Achaians"
5507,BOOK IX.,"stood up on this side and on that, and pledged them in cups of gold,"
5508,BOOK IX.,and questioned them; and Agamemnon king of men asked them first: “Come
5509,BOOK IX.,"now, tell me, Odysseus full of praise, thou great glory of the"
5510,BOOK IX.,"Achaians; will he save the ships from consuming fire, or said he nay,"
5511,BOOK IX.,and hath wrath yet hold of his proud spirit?”
5512,BOOK IX.,
5513,BOOK IX.,"And steadfast goodly Odysseus answered him: “Most noble son of Atreus,"
5514,BOOK IX.,"Agamemnon king of men, he yonder hath no mind to quench his wrath, but"
5515,BOOK IX.,"is yet more filled of fury, and spurneth thee and thy gifts. He biddeth"
5516,BOOK IX.,"thee take counsel for thyself amid the Argives, how to save the ships"
5517,BOOK IX.,and folk of the Achaians. And for himself he threateneth that at break
5518,BOOK IX.,of day he will launch upon the sea his trim well-benched ships.
5519,BOOK IX.,"Moreover he said that he would counsel all to sail for home, because ye"
5520,BOOK IX.,now shall never reach your goal of steep Ilios; surely far-seeing Zeus
5521,BOOK IX.,holdeth his hand over her and her folk are of good courage. Even so
5522,BOOK IX.,"said he, and here are also these to tell the tale that were my"
5523,BOOK IX.,"companions, Aias and the two heralds, both men discreet. But the old"
5524,BOOK IX.,"man Phoinix laid him there to rest, even as Achilles bade him, that he"
5525,BOOK IX.,"may follow with him on his ships to his dear native land to-morrow, if"
5526,BOOK IX.,he will; for he will not take him perforce.”
5527,BOOK IX.,
5528,BOOK IX.,"So said he, and they all held their peace and were still, marvelling at"
5529,BOOK IX.,"his saying, for he harangued very vehemently. Long were the sons of the"
5530,BOOK IX.,"Achaians voiceless for grief, but at the last Diomedes of the loud"
5531,BOOK IX.,"war-cry spake amid them: “Most noble son of Atreus, Agamemnon king of"
5532,BOOK IX.,"men, would thou hadst never besought Peleus’ glorious son with offer of"
5533,BOOK IX.,"gifts innumerable; proud is he at any time, but now hast thou yet far"
5534,BOOK IX.,"more encouraged him in his haughtiness. Howbeit we will let him bide,"
5535,BOOK IX.,"whether he go or tarry; hereafter he shall fight, whenever his heart"
5536,BOOK IX.,"within him biddeth and god arouseth him. Come now, even as I shall say"
5537,BOOK IX.,"let us all obey. Go ye now to rest, full to your hearts’ desire of meat"
5538,BOOK IX.,"and wine, wherein courage is and strength; but when fair rosy-fingered"
5539,BOOK IX.,"Dawn appeareth, array thou with all speed before the ships thy folk and"
5540,BOOK IX.,"horsemen, and urge them on; and fight thyself amid the foremost.”"
5541,BOOK IX.,
5542,BOOK IX.,"So said he, and all the princes gave assent, applauding the saying of"
5543,BOOK IX.,Diomedes tamer of horses. And then they made libation and went every
5544,BOOK IX.,"man to his hut, and there laid them to rest and took the boon of sleep."
5545,BOOK IX.,
5546,BOOK IX.,
5547,BOOK IX.,
5548,BOOK IX.,
5549,BOOK X.,BOOK X.
5550,BOOK X.,
5551,BOOK X.,
5552,BOOK X.,"How Diomedes and Odysseus slew Dolon, a spy of the Trojans, and"
5553,BOOK X.,"themselves spied on the Trojan camp, and took the horses of Rhesos, the"
5554,BOOK X.,Thracian king.
5555,BOOK X.,
5556,BOOK X.,
5557,BOOK X.,Now beside the ships the other leaders of the whole Achaian host were
5558,BOOK X.,"sleeping all night long, by soft Sleep overcome, but Agamemnon son of"
5559,BOOK X.,"Atreus, shepherd of the host, sweet Sleep held not, so many things he"
5560,BOOK X.,debated in his mind. And even as when the lord of fair-tressed Hera
5561,BOOK X.,"lighteneth, fashioning either a mighty rain unspeakable, or hail, or"
5562,BOOK X.,"snow, when the flakes sprinkle all the ploughed lands, or fashioning"
5563,BOOK X.,"perchance the wide mouth of bitter war, even so oft in his breast"
5564,BOOK X.,"groaned Agamemnon, from the very deep of his heart, and his spirits"
5565,BOOK X.,"trembled within him. And whensoever he looked toward that Trojan plain,"
5566,BOOK X.,"he marvelled at the many fires that blazed in front of Ilios, and at"
5567,BOOK X.,"the sound of flutes and pipes, and the noise of men; but whensoever to"
5568,BOOK X.,"the ships he glanced and the host of the Achaians, then rent he many a"
5569,BOOK X.,"lock clean forth from his head, to Zeus that is above, and greatly"
5570,BOOK X.,groaned his noble heart.
5571,BOOK X.,
5572,BOOK X.,"And this in his soul seemed to him the best counsel, to go first of all"
5573,BOOK X.,"to Nestor son of Neleus, if perchance he might contrive with him some"
5574,BOOK X.,right device that should be for the warding off of evil from all the
5575,BOOK X.,Danaans.
5576,BOOK X.,
5577,BOOK X.,"Then he rose, and did on his doublet about his breast, and beneath his"
5578,BOOK X.,"shining feet he bound on fair sandals, and thereafter clad him in the"
5579,BOOK X.,"tawny skin of a lion fiery and great, a skin that reached to the feet,"
5580,BOOK X.,and he grasped his spear.
5581,BOOK X.,
5582,BOOK X.,"And even in like wise did trembling fear take hold on Menelaos, (for"
5583,BOOK X.,"neither on his eyelids did Sleep settle down,) lest somewhat should"
5584,BOOK X.,"befall the Argives, who verily for his sake over wide waters were come"
5585,BOOK X.,"to Troy-land, with fierce war in their thoughts."
5586,BOOK X.,
5587,BOOK X.,"With a dappled pard’s skin first he covered his broad shoulders, and he"
5588,BOOK X.,"raised and set on his head a casque of bronze, and took a spear in his"
5589,BOOK X.,"strong hand. Then went he on his way to rouse his brother, that"
5590,BOOK X.,"mightily ruled over all the Argives, and as a god was honoured by the"
5591,BOOK X.,"people. Him found he harnessing his goodly gear about his shoulders, by"
5592,BOOK X.,"the stern of the ship, and glad to his brother was his coming. Then"
5593,BOOK X.,"Menelaos of the loud war-cry first accosted him: “Wherefore thus, dear"
5594,BOOK X.,"brother, art thou arming? Wilt thou speed forth any of thy comrades to"
5595,BOOK X.,"spy on the Trojans? Nay, terribly I fear lest none should undertake for"
5596,BOOK X.,"thee this deed, even to go and spy out the foeman alone through the"
5597,BOOK X.,ambrosial night; needs must he be a man right hardy of heart.”
5598,BOOK X.,
5599,BOOK X.,Then the lord Agamemnon answered him and spake: “Need of good counsel
5600,BOOK X.,"have I and thou, Menelaos fosterling of Zeus, of counsel that will help"
5601,BOOK X.,"and save the Argives and the ships, since the heart of Zeus hath turned"
5602,BOOK X.,again. Surely on the sacrifices of Hector hath he set his heart rather
5603,BOOK X.,"than on ours. For never did I see, nor heard any tell, that one man"
5604,BOOK X.,"devised so many terrible deeds in one day, as Hector, dear to Zeus,"
5605,BOOK X.,"hath wrought on the sons of the Achaians, unaided; though no dear son"
5606,BOOK X.,"of a goddess is he, nor of a god. He hath done deeds that methinks will"
5607,BOOK X.,"be a sorrow to the Argives, lasting and long, such evils hath he"
5608,BOOK X.,"devised against the Achaians. But go now, run swiftly by the ships, and"
5609,BOOK X.,"summon Aias and Idomeneus, but I will betake me to noble Nestor, and"
5610,BOOK X.,"bid him arise, if perchance he will be fain to go to the sacred company"
5611,BOOK X.,of the sentinels and lay on them his command. For to him above others
5612,BOOK X.,"would they listen, for his own son is chief among the sentinels, he and"
5613,BOOK X.,"the brother in arms of Idomeneus, even Meriones, for to them above all"
5614,BOOK X.,we entrusted this charge.”
5615,BOOK X.,
5616,BOOK X.,Then Menelaos of the loud war-cry answered him: “How meanest thou this
5617,BOOK X.,word wherewith thou dost command and exhort me? Am I to abide there
5618,BOOK X.,"with them, waiting till thou comest, or run back again to thee when I"
5619,BOOK X.,have well delivered to them thy commandment?”
5620,BOOK X.,
5621,BOOK X.,"Then the king of men, Agamemnon, answered him again: “There do thou"
5622,BOOK X.,"abide lest we miss each other as we go, for many are the paths through"
5623,BOOK X.,"the camp. But call aloud, wheresoever thou goest, and bid men awake,"
5624,BOOK X.,"naming each man by his lineage, and his father’s name, and giving all"
5625,BOOK X.,"their dues of honour, nor be thou proud of heart. Nay rather let us"
5626,BOOK X.,"ourselves be labouring, for even thus did Zeus from our very birth"
5627,BOOK X.,dispense to us the heaviness of toil.”
5628,BOOK X.,
5629,BOOK X.,"So he spake, and sent his brother away, having clearly laid on him his"
5630,BOOK X.,"commandment. Then went he himself after Nestor, the shepherd of the"
5631,BOOK X.,"host, whom he found by his hut and black ship, in his soft bed: beside"
5632,BOOK X.,"him lay his fair dight arms, a shield, and two spears, and a shining"
5633,BOOK X.,helmet. Beside him lay his glittering girdle wherewith the old man was
5634,BOOK X.,"wont to gird himself when he harnessed him for war, the bane of men,"
5635,BOOK X.,"and led on the host, for he yielded not to grievous old age. Then he"
5636,BOOK X.,"raised him on his elbow, lifting his head, and spake to the son of"
5637,BOOK X.,"Atreus, inquiring of him with this word: “Who art thou that farest"
5638,BOOK X.,"alone by the ships, through the camp in the dark night, when other"
5639,BOOK X.,"mortals are sleeping? Seekest thou one of thy mules, or of thy"
5640,BOOK X.,"comrades? speak, and come not silently upon me. What need hast thou?”"
5641,BOOK X.,
5642,BOOK X.,"Then the king of men, Agamemnon, answered him: “O Nestor, son of"
5643,BOOK X.,"Neleus, great glory of the Achaians, thou shalt know Agamemnon, son of"
5644,BOOK X.,"Atreus, whom above all men Zeus hath planted for ever among labours,"
5645,BOOK X.,"while my breath abides within my breast, and my knees move. I wander"
5646,BOOK X.,"thus, for that sweet sleep rests not on mine eyes, but war is my care,"
5647,BOOK X.,"and the troubles of the Achaians. Yea, greatly I fear for the sake of"
5648,BOOK X.,"the Danaans, nor is my heart firm, but I am tossed to and fro, and my"
5649,BOOK X.,"heart is leaping from my breast, and my good knees tremble beneath me."
5650,BOOK X.,"But if thou wilt do aught, since neither on thee cometh sleep, let us"
5651,BOOK X.,"go thither to the sentinels, that we may see them, lest they be fordone"
5652,BOOK X.,"with toil and drowsihead, and so are slumbering, and have quite"
5653,BOOK X.,"forgotten to keep watch. And hostile men camp hard by, nor know we at"
5654,BOOK X.,all but that they are keen to do battle in the night.”
5655,BOOK X.,
5656,BOOK X.,Then knightly Nestor of Gerenia answered him: “Most renowned son of
5657,BOOK X.,"Atreus, Agamemnon king of men, assuredly not all his designs will"
5658,BOOK X.,"wise-counselling Zeus fulfil for Hector, even all that now he thinketh;"
5659,BOOK X.,nay methinks he will contend with even more troubles if but Achilles
5660,BOOK X.,turn back his heart from grievous anger. And verily will I follow after
5661,BOOK X.,"thee, but let us also rouse others again, both the son of Tydeus,"
5662,BOOK X.,"spearman renowned, and Odysseus, and swift Aias, and the strong son of"
5663,BOOK X.,"Phyleus. But well it would be if one were to go and call those also,"
5664,BOOK X.,"the godlike Aias, and Idomeneus the prince; for their ships are"
5665,BOOK X.,"furthest of all, and nowise close at hand. But Menelaos will I blame,"
5666,BOOK X.,"dear as he is and worshipful, yea, even if thou be angry with me, nor"
5667,BOOK X.,"will I hide my thought, for that he slumbereth, and to thee alone hath"
5668,BOOK X.,left the toil; now should he be toiling among all the chiefs and
5669,BOOK X.,"beseeching them, for need no longer tolerable is coming upon us.”"
5670,BOOK X.,
5671,BOOK X.,"And the king of men, Agamemnon, answered him again: “Old man, another"
5672,BOOK X.,"day I even bid thee blame him, for often is he slack, and willeth not"
5673,BOOK X.,"to labour, yielding neither to unreadiness nor heedlessness of heart,"
5674,BOOK X.,"but looking toward me, and expecting mine instance. But now he awoke"
5675,BOOK X.,"far before me, and came to me, and him I sent forward to call those"
5676,BOOK X.,"concerning whom thou inquirest. But let us be gone, and them shall we"
5677,BOOK X.,"find before the gates, among the sentinels, for there I bade them"
5678,BOOK X.,gather.”
5679,BOOK X.,
5680,BOOK X.,Then knightly Nestor of Gerenia answered him: “So will none of the
5681,BOOK X.,"Argives be wroth with him or disobey him, when soever he doth urge any"
5682,BOOK X.,"one, and give him his commands.”"
5683,BOOK X.,
5684,BOOK X.,"So spake he and did on his doublet about his breast, and beneath his"
5685,BOOK X.,"bright feet he bound goodly shoon, and all around him buckled a purple"
5686,BOOK X.,"cloak, with double folds and wide, and thick down all over it."
5687,BOOK X.,
5688,BOOK X.,"And he took a strong spear, pointed with sharp bronze, and he went"
5689,BOOK X.,"among the ships of the mail-clad Achaians. Then Odysseus first, the"
5690,BOOK X.,"peer of Zeus in counsel, did knightly Gerenian Nestor arouse out of"
5691,BOOK X.,"sleep, with his voice, and quickly the cry came all about his heart,"
5692,BOOK X.,and he came forth from the hut and spake to them saying: “Wherefore
5693,BOOK X.,"thus among the ships and through the camp do ye wander alone, in the"
5694,BOOK X.,ambrosial night; what so great need cometh upon you?”
5695,BOOK X.,
5696,BOOK X.,"Then knightly Nestor of Gerenia answered him: “Laertes’ son, of the"
5697,BOOK X.,"seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many a wile, be not wroth, for great trouble"
5698,BOOK X.,"besetteth the Achaians. Nay follow, that we may arouse others too, even"
5699,BOOK X.,"all that it behoveth to take counsel, whether we should fly, or fight.”"
5700,BOOK X.,
5701,BOOK X.,"So spake he, and Odysseus of the many counsels came to the hut, and"
5702,BOOK X.,"cast a shield  bedight about his shoulders, and went after them."
5703,BOOK X.,
5704,BOOK X.,"And they went to seek Diomedes, son of Tydeus, and him they found"
5705,BOOK X.,"outside his hut, with his arms, and around him his comrades were"
5706,BOOK X.,"sleeping with their shields beneath their heads, but their spears were"
5707,BOOK X.,"driven into the ground erect on the spikes of the butts, and afar shone"
5708,BOOK X.,"the bronze, like the lightning of father Zeus. Now that hero was"
5709,BOOK X.,"asleep, and under him was strewn the hide of an ox of the field, but"
5710,BOOK X.,beneath his head was stretched a shining carpet. Beside him went and
5711,BOOK X.,stood knightly Nestor of Gerenia and stirred him with a touch of his
5712,BOOK X.,"foot, and aroused him, chiding him to his face, saying: “Wake, son of"
5713,BOOK X.,"Tydeus, why all night long dost thou sleep? Knowest thou not that the"
5714,BOOK X.,"Trojans on the high place of the plain are camped near the ships, and"
5715,BOOK X.,but a little space holdeth them apart?”
5716,BOOK X.,
5717,BOOK X.,"So spake he, and Diomedes sprang swiftly up out of sleep, and spake to"
5718,BOOK X.,"him winged words: “Hard art thou, old man, and from toil thou never"
5719,BOOK X.,"ceasest. Now are there not other younger sons of the Achaians, who"
5720,BOOK X.,"might rouse when there is need each of the kings, going all around the"
5721,BOOK X.,"host? but thou, old man, art indomitable.”"
5722,BOOK X.,
5723,BOOK X.,"And him knightly Nestor of Gerenia answered again, “Nay verily, my son,"
5724,BOOK X.,"all this that thou sayest is according unto right. Noble sons have I,"
5725,BOOK X.,"and there be many of the host, of whom each man might go and call the"
5726,BOOK X.,others. But a right great need hath assailed the Achaians. For now to
5727,BOOK X.,"all of us it standeth on a razor’s edge, either pitiful ruin for the"
5728,BOOK X.,"Achaians, or life. But come now, if indeed thou dost pity me, rouse"
5729,BOOK X.,"swift Aias, and the son of Phyleus, for thou art younger than I.”"
5730,BOOK X.,
5731,BOOK X.,"So spake he, and Diomedes cast round his shoulders the skin of a great"
5732,BOOK X.,"fiery lion, that reached to his feet, and he grasped his spear, and"
5733,BOOK X.,"started on his way, and roused the others from their place and led them"
5734,BOOK X.,on.
5735,BOOK X.,
5736,BOOK X.,"Now when they had come among the assembled sentinels, they found not"
5737,BOOK X.,"the leaders of the sentinels asleep, but they all sat wide awake with"
5738,BOOK X.,their arms. And even as hounds keep difficult guard round the sheep in
5739,BOOK X.,"a fold, having heard a hardy wild beast that cometh through the wood"
5740,BOOK X.,"among the hills, and much clamour riseth round him of hounds and men,"
5741,BOOK X.,"and sleep perisheth from them, even so sweet sleep did perish from"
5742,BOOK X.,"their eyes, as they watched through the wicked night, for ever were"
5743,BOOK X.,"they turning toward the plains, when they heard the Trojans moving."
5744,BOOK X.,
5745,BOOK X.,"And that old man was glad when he saw them, and heartened them with his"
5746,BOOK X.,"saying, and calling out to them he spake winged words: “Even so now,"
5747,BOOK X.,"dear children, do ye keep watch, nor let sleep take any man, lest we"
5748,BOOK X.,become a cause of rejoicing to them that hate us.”
5749,BOOK X.,
5750,BOOK X.,"So saying he sped through the moat, and they followed with him, the"
5751,BOOK X.,"kings of the Argives, who had been called to the council. And with them"
5752,BOOK X.,"went Meriones, and the glorious son of Nestor, for they called them to"
5753,BOOK X.,"share their counsel. So they went clean out of the delved foss, and sat"
5754,BOOK X.,"down in the open, where the mid-space was clear of dead men fallen,"
5755,BOOK X.,"where fierce Hector had turned again from destroying the Argives, when"
5756,BOOK X.,"night covered all. There sat they down, and declared their saying each"
5757,BOOK X.,"to the other, and to them knightly Nestor of Gerenia began discourse:"
5758,BOOK X.,"“O friends, is there then no man that would trust to his own daring"
5759,BOOK X.,"spirit, to go among the great-hearted Trojans, if perchance he might"
5760,BOOK X.,"take some straggler of the enemy, yea, or hear perchance some rumour"
5761,BOOK X.,"among the Trojans, and what things they devise among themselves,"
5762,BOOK X.,"whether they are fain to abide there by the ships, away from the city,"
5763,BOOK X.,"or will retreat again to the city, now that they have conquered the"
5764,BOOK X.,"Achaians? All this might such an one learn, and back to us come"
5765,BOOK X.,"scathless: great would be his fame under heaven among all men, and a"
5766,BOOK X.,goodly gift will be given him. For all the best men that bear sway by
5767,BOOK X.,"the ships, each and all of them will give him a black ewe, with her"
5768,BOOK X.,"lamb at her foot,—no chattel may compare with her,—and ever will he be"
5769,BOOK X.,present at feasts and clan-drinkings.”
5770,BOOK X.,
5771,BOOK X.,"So spake he, and thereon were they all silent, holding their peace, but"
5772,BOOK X.,"to them spake Diomedes of the loud war-cry: “Nestor, my heart and"
5773,BOOK X.,"manful spirit urge me to enter the camp of the foemen hard by, even of"
5774,BOOK X.,"the Trojans: but and if some other man will follow with me, more"
5775,BOOK X.,"comfort and more courage will there be. If two go together, one before"
5776,BOOK X.,"another perceiveth a matter, how there may be gain therein; but if one"
5777,BOOK X.,"alone perceive aught, even so his wit is shorter, and weak his device.”"
5778,BOOK X.,
5779,BOOK X.,"So spake he, and many were they that wished to follow Diomedes. The two"
5780,BOOK X.,"Aiantes were willing, men of Ares’ company, and Meriones was willing,"
5781,BOOK X.,"and right willing the son of Nestor, and the son of Atreus, Menelaos,"
5782,BOOK X.,"spearman renowned, yea and the hardy Odysseus was willing to steal into"
5783,BOOK X.,"the throng of Trojans, for always daring was his heart within him. But"
5784,BOOK X.,"among them spake the king of men, Agamemnon: “Diomedes son of Tydeus,"
5785,BOOK X.,"joy of mine heart, thy comrade verily shalt thou choose, whomsoever"
5786,BOOK X.,"thou wilt, the best of them that be here, for many are eager. But do"
5787,BOOK X.,"not thou, out of reverent heart, leave the better man behind, and give"
5788,BOOK X.,"thyself the worse companion, yielding to regard for any, and looking to"
5789,BOOK X.,"their lineage, even if one be more kingly born.”"
5790,BOOK X.,
5791,BOOK X.,"So spake he, but was in fear for the sake of fair-haired Menelaos. But"
5792,BOOK X.,to them again answered Diomedes of the loud war-cry: “If indeed ye bid
5793,BOOK X.,"me choose myself a comrade, how then could I be unmindful of godlike"
5794,BOOK X.,"Odysseus, whose heart is passing eager, and his spirit so manful in all"
5795,BOOK X.,manner of toils; and Pallas Athene loveth him. But while he cometh with
5796,BOOK X.,"me, even out of burning fire might we both return, for he excelleth in"
5797,BOOK X.,understanding.”
5798,BOOK X.,
5799,BOOK X.,"Then him again answered the steadfast noble Odysseus: “Son of Tydeus,"
5800,BOOK X.,"praise me not overmuch, neither blame me aught, for thou speakest thus"
5801,BOOK X.,"among the Argives that themselves know all. But let us be going, for"
5802,BOOK X.,"truly the night is waning, and near is the dawn, and the stars have"
5803,BOOK X.,"gone onward, and the night has advanced more than two watches, but the"
5804,BOOK X.,third watch is yet left.”
5805,BOOK X.,
5806,BOOK X.,"So spake they, and harnessed them in their dread armour. To the son of"
5807,BOOK X.,Tydeus did Thrasymedes steadfast in war give a two-edged sword (for his
5808,BOOK X.,"own was left by his ship) and a shield, and about his head set a helm"
5809,BOOK X.,"of bull’s hide, without cone or crest, that is called a skull-cap, and"
5810,BOOK X.,keeps the heads of stalwart youths. And Meriones gave Odysseus a bow
5811,BOOK X.,"and a quiver, and a sword, and on his head set a helm made of leather,"
5812,BOOK X.,"and with many a thong was it stiffly wrought within, while without the"
5813,BOOK X.,white teeth of a boar of flashing tusks were arrayed thick set on
5814,BOOK X.,"either side, well and cunningly, and in the midst was fixed a cap of"
5815,BOOK X.,"felt. This casque Autolykos once stole from Amyntor son of Ormenos, out"
5816,BOOK X.,"of Eleon, breaking into his well-builded house; and he gave it to"
5817,BOOK X.,Amphidamas of Kythera to take to Skandeia and Amphidamas gave it for a
5818,BOOK X.,"guest-gift to Molos, who gave it to his own son Meriones to wear, and"
5819,BOOK X.,now it was set to cover the head of Odysseus.
5820,BOOK X.,
5821,BOOK X.,"So when these twain had harnessed them in their dread armour, they set"
5822,BOOK X.,"forth to go, and left there all the best of the host. And to them did"
5823,BOOK X.,"Pallas Athene send forth an omen on the right, a heron hard by the way,"
5824,BOOK X.,"and they beheld it not with their eyes, through the dark night, but"
5825,BOOK X.,they heard its shrill cry. And Odysseus was glad in the omen of the
5826,BOOK X.,"bird, and prayed to Athene: “Listen to me, thou child of aegis-bearing"
5827,BOOK X.,"Zeus, that ever in all toils dost stand by me, nor doth any motion of"
5828,BOOK X.,"mine escape thee: but now again above all be thou friendly to me,"
5829,BOOK X.,"Athene, and grant that we come back with renown to the ships, having"
5830,BOOK X.,"wrought a great work, that shall be sorrow to the Trojans.”"
5831,BOOK X.,
5832,BOOK X.,Next again prayed Diomedes of the loud war-cry: “Listen now likewise to
5833,BOOK X.,"me, thou child of Zeus, unwearied maiden, and follow with me as when"
5834,BOOK X.,"with my father thou didst follow, even noble Tydeus, into Thebes, when"
5835,BOOK X.,he went forth as a messenger from the Achaians. And them he left by the
5836,BOOK X.,"Asopos, the mail-clad Achaians, and a honeyed word he bare to the"
5837,BOOK X.,Kadmeians in that place; but on his backward way he devised right
5838,BOOK X.,"terrible deeds, with thee, fair goddess, for eager didst thou stand by"
5839,BOOK X.,"him. Even so now stand thou by me willingly, and protect me. And to"
5840,BOOK X.,"thee will I sacrifice a yearling heifer, broad of brow, unbroken, that"
5841,BOOK X.,"never yet hath man led below the yoke. Her will I sacrifice to thee,"
5842,BOOK X.,and gild her horns with gold.”
5843,BOOK X.,
5844,BOOK X.,"So spake they in their prayer, and Pallas Athene heard them. And when"
5845,BOOK X.,"they had prayed to the daughter of mighty Zeus, they went forth on"
5846,BOOK X.,"their way, like two lions, through the dark night, amid the slaughter,"
5847,BOOK X.,"amid the slain men, through the arms and the black blood."
5848,BOOK X.,
5849,BOOK X.,"Nay, nor the stout-hearted Trojans did Hector suffer to sleep, but he"
5850,BOOK X.,"called together all the best of them, all that were chiefs and leaders"
5851,BOOK X.,"of the Trojans, them did he call together, and contrived a crafty"
5852,BOOK X.,"counsel: “Who is there that would promise and perform for me this deed,"
5853,BOOK X.,for a great gift? yea his reward shall be sufficient. For I will give
5854,BOOK X.,"him a chariot, and two horses of arching neck, the best that be at the"
5855,BOOK X.,"swift ships of the Achaians, to whosoever shall dare the deed, and for"
5856,BOOK X.,himself shall win glory. And the deed is this; to go near the
5857,BOOK X.,"swift-faring ships, and seek out whether the swift ships are guarded,"
5858,BOOK X.,"as of old, or whether already, being subdued beneath our hands, the"
5859,BOOK X.,"foes are devising of flight among themselves, and have no care to watch"
5860,BOOK X.,"through the night, being fordone with dread weariness.”"
5861,BOOK X.,
5862,BOOK X.,"So spake he, but they were all silent and held their peace. Now there"
5863,BOOK X.,"was among the Trojans one Dolon, the son of Eumedes the godlike herald,"
5864,BOOK X.,"and he was rich in gold, and rich in bronze: and verily he was ill"
5865,BOOK X.,"favoured to look upon, but swift of foot; now he was an only son among"
5866,BOOK X.,five sisters. So he spake then a word to the Trojans and to Hector:
5867,BOOK X.,"“Hector, my heart and manful spirit urge me to go near the swift-faring"
5868,BOOK X.,"ships, and spy out all. But come, I pray thee, hold up the staff, and"
5869,BOOK X.,"swear to me, that verily thou wilt give me the horses and the chariots"
5870,BOOK X.,bedight with bronze that bear the noble son of Peleus. But to thee I
5871,BOOK X.,"will prove no vain spy, nor disappoint thy hope. For I will go straight"
5872,BOOK X.,"to the camp, until I may come to the ship of Agamemnon, where surely"
5873,BOOK X.,"the chiefs are like to hold council, whether to fight or flee.”"
5874,BOOK X.,
5875,BOOK X.,"So spake he, and Hector took the staff in his hand, and sware to him:"
5876,BOOK X.,"“Now let Zeus himself be witness, the loud-thundering lord of Hera,"
5877,BOOK X.,"that no other man of the Trojans shall mount those horses, but thou, I"
5878,BOOK X.,"declare, shalt rejoice in them for ever.”"
5879,BOOK X.,
5880,BOOK X.,"So spake he, and sware a bootless oath thereto, and aroused Dolon to"
5881,BOOK X.,"go. And straightway he cast on his shoulders his crooked bow, and did"
5882,BOOK X.,"on thereover the skin of a grey wolf, and on his head a helm of"
5883,BOOK X.,"ferret-skin, and took a sharp javelin, and went on his way to the ships"
5884,BOOK X.,from the host. But he was not like to come back from the ships and
5885,BOOK X.,bring word to Hector.
5886,BOOK X.,
5887,BOOK X.,"But when he had left the throng of men and horses, he went forth"
5888,BOOK X.,"eagerly on the way, and Odysseus of the seed of Zeus was ware of him as"
5889,BOOK X.,"he approached, and said unto Diomedes: “Lo, here is some man, Diomedes,"
5890,BOOK X.,"coming from the camp, I know not whether as a spy to our ships, or to"
5891,BOOK X.,strip certain of the dead men fallen. But let us suffer him to pass by
5892,BOOK X.,"us a little way on the plain, and thereafter may we rush on him and"
5893,BOOK X.,"take him speedily, and if it chance that he outrun us by speed of foot,"
5894,BOOK X.,"ever do thou hem him in towards the ships and away from the camp,"
5895,BOOK X.,"rushing on him with thy spear, lest in any wise he escape towards the"
5896,BOOK X.,city.”
5897,BOOK X.,
5898,BOOK X.,"So they spake, and turning out of the path they lay down among the"
5899,BOOK X.,bodies of the dead; and swiftly Dolon ran past them in his witlessness.
5900,BOOK X.,But when he was as far off as is the length of the furrow made by
5901,BOOK X.,"mules, (for better far are they than kine, tho drag the jointed plough"
5902,BOOK X.,"through the deep fallow,) these twain ran after him, and he stood still"
5903,BOOK X.,"when he heard the sound, supposing in his heart that they were friends"
5904,BOOK X.,"come from among the Trojans to turn him back, at the countermand of"
5905,BOOK X.,"Hector. But when they were about a spear-cast off, or even less, he"
5906,BOOK X.,"knew them for foemen, and stirred his swift limbs to fly, and speedily"
5907,BOOK X.,they started in pursuit.
5908,BOOK X.,
5909,BOOK X.,"And as when two sharp-toothed hounds, well skilled in the chase, press"
5910,BOOK X.,"ever hard on a doe or a hare through a wooded land, and it runs"
5911,BOOK X.,"screaming before them, even so Tydeus’ son and Odysseus the sacker of"
5912,BOOK X.,"cities cut Dolon off from the host, and ever pursued hard after him."
5913,BOOK X.,"But when he was just about to come among the sentinels, in his flight"
5914,BOOK X.,"towards the ships, then Athene poured strength into the son of Tydeus,"
5915,BOOK X.,that none of the mail-clad Achaians might boast himself the first to
5916,BOOK X.,"smite, and he come second. And strong Diomedes leaped upon him with the"
5917,BOOK X.,"spear, and said: “Stand, or I shall overtake thee with the spear, and"
5918,BOOK X.,methinks that thou shalt not long avoid sheer destruction at my hand.”
5919,BOOK X.,
5920,BOOK X.,"So spake he, and threw his spear, but of his own will he missed the"
5921,BOOK X.,"man, and passing over his right shoulder the point of the polished"
5922,BOOK X.,"spear stuck fast in the ground: and Dolon stood still, in great dread"
5923,BOOK X.,"and trembling, and the teeth chattered in his mouth, and he was green"
5924,BOOK X.,"with fear. Then the twain came up with him, panting, and gripped his"
5925,BOOK X.,"hands, and weeping he spake: “Take me alive, and I will ransom myself,"
5926,BOOK X.,"for within our house there is bronze, and gold, and smithied iron,"
5927,BOOK X.,"wherefrom my father would do you grace with ransom untold, if he should"
5928,BOOK X.,learn that I am alive among the ships of the Achaians.”
5929,BOOK X.,
5930,BOOK X.,Then Odysseus of the many counsels answered him and said: “Take
5931,BOOK X.,"courage, let not death be in thy mind, but come speak and tell me truly"
5932,BOOK X.,"all the tale, why thus from the host lost thou come all alone among the"
5933,BOOK X.,"ships, through the black night, when other mortals are sleeping? Comest"
5934,BOOK X.,"thou to strip certain of the dead men fallen, or did Hector send thee"
5935,BOOK X.,"forth to spy out everything at the hollow ships, or did thine own"
5936,BOOK X.,spirit urge thee on?”
5937,BOOK X.,
5938,BOOK X.,"Then Dolon answered him, his limbs trembling beneath him: “With many a"
5939,BOOK X.,"blind hope did Hector lead my wits astray, who vowed to give me the"
5940,BOOK X.,"whole-hooved horses of the proud son of Peleus, and his car bedight"
5941,BOOK X.,"with bronze: and he bade me fare through the swift black night, and"
5942,BOOK X.,"draw nigh the foemen, and seek out whether the swift ships are guarded,"
5943,BOOK X.,"as of old, or whether, already, being subdued beneath our hands, they"
5944,BOOK X.,"are devising of flight among themselves, and have no care to watch"
5945,BOOK X.,"through the night, being fordone with dread weariness.”"
5946,BOOK X.,
5947,BOOK X.,And smiling thereat did Odysseus of the many counsels make him answer:
5948,BOOK X.,"“Verily now thy soul was set on great rewards, even the horses of the"
5949,BOOK X.,"wise son of Aiakos, but hard are they for mortal men to master, and"
5950,BOOK X.,"hard to drive, for any but Achilles only, whom a deathless mother bare."
5951,BOOK X.,"But come, tell me all this truly, all the tale: where when thou camest"
5952,BOOK X.,"hither didst thou leave Hector, shepherd of the host, and where lie his"
5953,BOOK X.,"warlike gear, and where his horses? And how are disposed the watches,"
5954,BOOK X.,and the beds of the other Trojans? And what counsel take they among
5955,BOOK X.,"themselves; are they fain to abide there nigh the ships, afar from the"
5956,BOOK X.,"city, or will they return to the city again, seeing that they have"
5957,BOOK X.,subdued unto them the Achaians?”
5958,BOOK X.,
5959,BOOK X.,"Then Dolon son of Eumedes made him answer again: “Lo, now all these"
5960,BOOK X.,things will I recount to thee most truly. Hector with them that are
5961,BOOK X.,"counsellors holdeth council by the barrow of godlike Ilos, apart from"
5962,BOOK X.,"the din, but as for the guards whereof thou askest, oh hero, no chosen"
5963,BOOK X.,watch nor guard keepeth the host. As for all the watch fires of the
5964,BOOK X.,"Trojans—on them is necessity, so that they watch and encourage each"
5965,BOOK X.,"other to keep guard; but, for the allies called from many lands, they"
5966,BOOK X.,"are sleeping and to the Trojans they leave it to keep watch, for no"
5967,BOOK X.,wise near dwell the children and wives of the allies.”
5968,BOOK X.,
5969,BOOK X.,Then Odysseus of the many counsels answered him and said: “How stands
5970,BOOK X.,"it now, do they sleep amidst the horse-taming Trojans, or apart? tell"
5971,BOOK X.,"me clearly, that I may know.”"
5972,BOOK X.,
5973,BOOK X.,Then answered him Dolon son of Eumedes: “Verily all this likewise will
5974,BOOK X.,"I recount to thee truly. Towards the sea lie the Karians, and Paionians"
5975,BOOK X.,"of the bended bow, and the Leleges and Kaukones, and noble Pelasgoi."
5976,BOOK X.,"And towards Thymbre the Lykians have their place, and the haughty"
5977,BOOK X.,"Mysians, and the Phrygians that fight from chariots, and Maionians"
5978,BOOK X.,lords of chariots. But wherefore do ye inquire of me throughly
5979,BOOK X.,concerning all these things? for if ye desire to steal into the throng
5980,BOOK X.,"of Trojans, lo, there be those Thracians, new comers, at the furthest"
5981,BOOK X.,"point apart from the rest, and among them their king Rhesos, son of"
5982,BOOK X.,"Eïoneus. His be the fairest horses that ever I beheld, and the"
5983,BOOK X.,"greatest, whiter than snow, and for speed like the winds. And his"
5984,BOOK X.,"chariot is fashioned well with gold and silver, and golden is his"
5985,BOOK X.,"armour that he brought with him, marvellous, a wonder to behold; such"
5986,BOOK X.,"as it is in no wise fit for mortal men to bear, but for the deathless"
5987,BOOK X.,"gods. But bring me now to the swift ships, or leave me here, when ye"
5988,BOOK X.,"have bound me with a ruthless bond, that ye may go and make trial of me"
5989,BOOK X.,"whether I have spoken to you truth, or lies.”"
5990,BOOK X.,
5991,BOOK X.,"Then strong Diomedes, looking grimly on him, said: “Put no thought of"
5992,BOOK X.,"escape, Dolon, in thy heart, for all the good tidings thou hast"
5993,BOOK X.,"brought, since once thou hast come into our hands. For if now we"
5994,BOOK X.,"release thee or let thee go, on some later day wilt thou come to the"
5995,BOOK X.,"swift ships of the Achaians, either to play the spy, or to fight in"
5996,BOOK X.,"open war, but if subdued beneath my hands thou lose thy life, never"
5997,BOOK X.,again wilt thou prove a bane to the Argives.”
5998,BOOK X.,
5999,BOOK X.,"He spake, and that other with strong hand was about to touch his chin,"
6000,BOOK X.,"and implore his mercy, but Diomedes smote him on the midst of the neck,"
6001,BOOK X.,"rushing on him with the sword, and cut through both the sinews, and the"
6002,BOOK X.,head of him still speaking was mingled with the dust. And they stripped
6003,BOOK X.,"him of the casque of ferret’s skin from off his head, and of his"
6004,BOOK X.,"wolf-skin, and his bended bow, and his long spear, and these to Athene"
6005,BOOK X.,"the Giver of Spoil did noble Odysseus hold aloft in his hand, and he"
6006,BOOK X.,"prayed and spake a word: “Rejoice, O goddess, in these, for to thee"
6007,BOOK X.,"first of all the Immortals in Olympus will we call for aid; nay, but"
6008,BOOK X.,yet again send us on against the horses and the sleeping places of the
6009,BOOK X.,Thracian men.”
6010,BOOK X.,
6011,BOOK X.,"So spake he aloud, and lifted from him the spoils on high, and set them"
6012,BOOK X.,"on a tamarisk bush, and raised thereon a mark right plain to see,"
6013,BOOK X.,"gathering together reeds, and luxuriant shoots of tamarisk, lest they"
6014,BOOK X.,should miss the place as they returned again through the swift dark
6015,BOOK X.,night.
6016,BOOK X.,
6017,BOOK X.,"So the twain went forward through the arms, and the black blood, and"
6018,BOOK X.,quickly they came to the company of Thracian men. Now they were
6019,BOOK X.,"slumbering, fordone with toil, but their goodly weapons lay by them on"
6020,BOOK X.,"the ground, all orderly, in three rows, and by each man his pair of"
6021,BOOK X.,"steeds. And Rhesos slept in the midst, and beside him his swift horses"
6022,BOOK X.,were bound with thongs to the topmost rim of the chariot. Him Odysseus
6023,BOOK X.,"spied from afar, and showed him unto Diomedes: “Lo, Diomedes, this is"
6024,BOOK X.,"the man, and these are the horses whereof Dolon that we slew did give"
6025,BOOK X.,"us tidings. But come now, put forth thy great strength; it doth not"
6026,BOOK X.,"behove thee to stand idle with thy weapons: nay, loose the horses; or"
6027,BOOK X.,"do thou slay the men, and of the horses will I take heed.”"
6028,BOOK X.,
6029,BOOK X.,"So spake he, and into that other bright-eyed Athene breathed might, and"
6030,BOOK X.,"he began slaying on this side and on that, and hideously went up their"
6031,BOOK X.,"groaning, as they were smitten with the sword, and the earth was"
6032,BOOK X.,reddened with blood. And like as a lion cometh on flocks without a
6033,BOOK X.,"herdsman, on goats or sheep, and leaps upon them with evil will, so set"
6034,BOOK X.,"the son of Tydeus on the men of Thrace, till he had slain twelve. But"
6035,BOOK X.,"whomsoever the son of Tydeus drew near and smote with the sword, him"
6036,BOOK X.,"did Odysseus of the many counsels seize by the foot from behind, and"
6037,BOOK X.,"drag him out of the way, with this design in his heart, that the"
6038,BOOK X.,"fair-maned horses might lightly issue forth, and not tremble in spirit,"
6039,BOOK X.,when they trod over the dead; for they were not yet used to dead men.
6040,BOOK X.,"But when the son of Tydeus came upon the king, he was the thirteenth"
6041,BOOK X.,"from whom he took sweet life away, as he was breathing hard, for an"
6042,BOOK X.,"evil dream stood above his head that night, even the seed of Oineus,"
6043,BOOK X.,through the device of Athene. Meanwhile the hardy Odysseus loosed the
6044,BOOK X.,"whole-hooved horses, and bound them together with thongs, and drave"
6045,BOOK X.,"them out of the press, smiting them with his bow, since he had not"
6046,BOOK X.,taken thought to lift the shining whip with his hands from the
6047,BOOK X.,well-dight chariot: then he whistled for a sign to noble Diomedes.
6048,BOOK X.,
6049,BOOK X.,"But Diomedes stood and pondered what most daring deed he might do,"
6050,BOOK X.,"whether he should take the chariot, where lay the fair-dight armour,"
6051,BOOK X.,"and drag it out by the pole, or lift it upon high, and so bear it"
6052,BOOK X.,"forth, or whether he should take the life away from yet more of the"
6053,BOOK X.,"Thracians. And while he was pondering this in his heart, then Athene"
6054,BOOK X.,"drew near, and stood, and spake to noble Diomedes: “Bethink thee of"
6055,BOOK X.,"returning, O son of great-hearted Tydeus, to the hollow ships, lest"
6056,BOOK X.,"perchance thou come thither in flight, and perchance another god rouse"
6057,BOOK X.,up the Trojans likewise.”
6058,BOOK X.,
6059,BOOK X.,"So spake she, and he observed the voice of the utterance of the"
6060,BOOK X.,"goddess, and swiftly he sprang upon the steeds, and Odysseus smote them"
6061,BOOK X.,"with his bow, and they sped to the swift ships of the Achaians."
6062,BOOK X.,
6063,BOOK X.,"Nay, nor a vain watch kept Apollo of the silver bow, when he beheld"
6064,BOOK X.,Athene caring for the son of Tydeus; in wrath against her he stole
6065,BOOK X.,"among the crowded press of Trojans, and aroused a counsellor of the"
6066,BOOK X.,"Thracians, Hippokoon, the noble kinsman of Rhesos. And he started out"
6067,BOOK X.,"of sleep, when he beheld the place desolate where the swift horses had"
6068,BOOK X.,"stood, and beheld the men gasping in the death struggle; then he"
6069,BOOK X.,"groaned aloud, and called out by name to his comrade dear. And a"
6070,BOOK X.,"clamour arose and din unspeakable of the Trojans hasting together, and"
6071,BOOK X.,"they marvelled at the terrible deeds, even all that the heroes had"
6072,BOOK X.,"wrought, and had gone thereafter to the hollow ships."
6073,BOOK X.,
6074,BOOK X.,But when those others came to the place where they had slain the spy of
6075,BOOK X.,"Hector, there Odysseus, dear to Zeus, checked the swift horses, and"
6076,BOOK X.,"Tydeus’ son, leaping to the ground, set the bloody spoil in the hands"
6077,BOOK X.,"of Odysseus, and again mounted, and lashed the horses, and they sped"
6078,BOOK X.,"onward nothing loth. [to the hollow ships, for there they fain would"
6079,BOOK X.,"be]. But Nestor first heard the sound, and said: “O friends, leaders"
6080,BOOK X.,"and counsellors of the Argives, shall I be wrong or speak sooth? for my"
6081,BOOK X.,heart bids me speak. The sound of swift-footed horses strikes upon mine
6082,BOOK X.,ears. Would to god that Odysseus and that strong Diomedes may even
6083,BOOK X.,instantly be driving the whole-hooved horses from among the Trojans;
6084,BOOK X.,but terribly I fear in mine heart lest the bravest of the Argives
6085,BOOK X.,suffer aught through the Trojans’ battle din.”
6086,BOOK X.,
6087,BOOK X.,"Not yet was his whole word spoken, when they came themselves, and"
6088,BOOK X.,"leaped down to earth, but gladly the others welcomed them with"
6089,BOOK X.,"hand-clasping, and with honeyed words. And first did knightly Nestor of"
6090,BOOK X.,"Gerenia make question: “Come, tell me now, renowned Odysseus, great"
6091,BOOK X.,"glory of the Achaians, how ye twain took those horses? Was it by"
6092,BOOK X.,"stealing into the press of Trojans? Or did some god meet you, and give"
6093,BOOK X.,you them? Wondrous like are they to rays of the sun. Ever with the
6094,BOOK X.,"Trojans do I mix in fight, nor methinks do I tarry by the ships, old"
6095,BOOK X.,"warrior as I am. But never yet saw I such horses, nor deemed of such."
6096,BOOK X.,"Nay, methinks some god must have encountered you and given you these."
6097,BOOK X.,"For both of you doth Zeus the cloud-gatherer love, and the maiden of"
6098,BOOK X.,"aegis-bearing Zeus, bright-eyed Athene.”"
6099,BOOK X.,
6100,BOOK X.,"And him answered Odysseus of the many counsels: “O Nestor, son of"
6101,BOOK X.,"Neleus, great glory of the Achaians, lightly could a god, if so he"
6102,BOOK X.,"would, give even better steeds than these, for the gods are far"
6103,BOOK X.,"stronger than we. But as for these new come horses, whereof, old man,"
6104,BOOK X.,"thou askest me, they are Thracian, but their lord did brave Diomedes"
6105,BOOK X.,"slay, and beside him all the twelve best men of his company. The"
6106,BOOK X.,"thirteenth man was a spy we took near the ships, one that Hector and"
6107,BOOK X.,the other haughty Trojans sent forth to pry upon our camp.”
6108,BOOK X.,
6109,BOOK X.,"So spake he, and drave the whole-hooved horses through the fosse,"
6110,BOOK X.,laughing; and the other Achaians went with him joyfully. But when they
6111,BOOK X.,"had come to the well-built hut of the son of Tydeus, they bound the"
6112,BOOK X.,"horses with well-cut thongs, at the mangers where the swift horses of"
6113,BOOK X.,Diomedes stood eating honey-sweet barley.
6114,BOOK X.,
6115,BOOK X.,And Odysseus placed the bloody spoils of Dolon in the stern of the
6116,BOOK X.,"ship, that they might make ready a sacred offering to Athene. But for"
6117,BOOK X.,"themselves, they went into the sea, and washed off the thick sweat from"
6118,BOOK X.,"shins, and neck, and thighs. But when the wave of the sea had washed"
6119,BOOK X.,"the thick sweat from their skin, and their hearts revived again, they"
6120,BOOK X.,"went into polished baths, and were cleansed."
6121,BOOK X.,
6122,BOOK X.,"And when they had washed, and anointed them with olive oil, they sat"
6123,BOOK X.,"down at supper, and from the full mixing bowl they drew off the"
6124,BOOK X.,"honey-sweet wine, and poured it forth to Athene."

6132,BOOK XI.,"Despite the glorious deeds of Agamemnon, the Trojans press hard on the"
6133,BOOK XI.,"Achaians, and the beginning of evil comes on Patroklos."
6134,BOOK XI.,
6135,BOOK XI.,
6136,BOOK XI.,"Now Dawn arose from her couch beside proud Tithonos, to bring light to"
6137,BOOK XI.,the Immortals and to mortal men. But Zeus sent forth fierce Discord
6138,BOOK XI.,"unto the fleet ships of the Achaians, and in her hands she held the"
6139,BOOK XI.,"signal of war. And she stood upon the huge black ship of Odysseus, that"
6140,BOOK XI.,"was in the midst, to make her voice heard on either side, both to the"
6141,BOOK XI.,"huts of Aias, son of Telamon, and to the huts of Achilles, for these"
6142,BOOK XI.,"twain, trusting in their valour and the might of their hands, had drawn"
6143,BOOK XI.,up their trim ships at the two ends of the line. There stood the
6144,BOOK XI.,"goddess and cried shrilly in a great voice and terrible, and mighty"
6145,BOOK XI.,"strength she set in the heart of each of the Achaians, to war and fight"
6146,BOOK XI.,unceasingly. And straightway to them war grew sweeter than to depart in
6147,BOOK XI.,the hollow ships to their dear native land.
6148,BOOK XI.,
6149,BOOK XI.,"Then the son of Atreus cried aloud, and bade the Argives arm them, and"
6150,BOOK XI.,himself amid them did on the flashing bronze. First he fastened fair
6151,BOOK XI.,"greaves about his legs, fitted with ankle-clasps of silver; next again"
6152,BOOK XI.,"he did his breastplate about his breast, the breastplate that in time"
6153,BOOK XI.,past Kinyras gave him for a guest-gift. For afar in Cyprus did Kinyras
6154,BOOK XI.,hear the mighty rumour how that the Achaians were about to sail forth
6155,BOOK XI.,"to Troy in their ships, wherefore did Kinyras give him the breastplate,"
6156,BOOK XI.,to do pleasure to the king. Now therein were ten courses of black
6157,BOOK XI.,"cyanus, and twelve of gold, and twenty of tin, and dark blue snakes"
6158,BOOK XI.,"writhed up towards the neck, three on either side, like rainbows that"
6159,BOOK XI.,"the son of Kronos hath set in the clouds, a marvel of the mortal tribes"
6160,BOOK XI.,"of men. And round his shoulders he cast his sword, wherein shone studs"
6161,BOOK XI.,"of gold, but the scabbard about it was silver, fitted with golden"
6162,BOOK XI.,chains. And he took the richly-dight shield of his valour that covereth
6163,BOOK XI.,"all the body of a man, a fair shield, and round about it were ten"
6164,BOOK XI.,"circles of bronze, and thereon were twenty white bosses of tin, and one"
6165,BOOK XI.,in the midst of black cyanus. And thereon was embossed the Gorgon fell
6166,BOOK XI.,"of aspect glaring terribly, and about her were Dread and Terror. And"
6167,BOOK XI.,"from the shield was hung a baldric of silver, and thereon was curled a"
6168,BOOK XI.,"snake of cyanus; three heads interlaced had he, growing out of one"
6169,BOOK XI.,neck. And on his head Agamemnon set a two-crested helm with fourfold
6170,BOOK XI.,"plate, and plume of horse-hair, and terribly the crest nodded from"
6171,BOOK XI.,"above. And he grasped two strong spears, shod with bronze and keen, and"
6172,BOOK XI.,far forth from him into the heaven shone the bronze; and thereat Hera
6173,BOOK XI.,"and Athene thundered, honouring the king of Mykene rich in gold."
6174,BOOK XI.,
6175,BOOK XI.,"Then each man gave in charge his horses to his charioteer, to hold them"
6176,BOOK XI.,"in by the fosse, well and orderly, and themselves as heavy men at arms"
6177,BOOK XI.,"were hasting about, being harnessed in their gear, and unquenchable the"
6178,BOOK XI.,cry arose into the Dawn. And long before the charioteers were they
6179,BOOK XI.,"arrayed at the fosse, but after them a little way came up the drivers."
6180,BOOK XI.,"And among them the son of Kronos aroused an evil din, and from above"
6181,BOOK XI.,"rained down dew danked with blood out of the upper air, for that he was"
6182,BOOK XI.,about to send many strong men down to Hades.
6183,BOOK XI.,
6184,BOOK XI.,"But the Trojans on the other side, on the high ground of the plain,"
6185,BOOK XI.,"gathered them around great Hector, and noble Polydamus, and Aineias"
6186,BOOK XI.,"that as a god was honoured by the people of the Trojans, and the three"
6187,BOOK XI.,"sons of Antenor, Polybos, and noble Agenor, and young Akamas like unto"
6188,BOOK XI.,the Immortals. And Hector in the foremost rank bare the circle of his
6189,BOOK XI.,shield. And as from amid the clouds appeareth glittering a baneful
6190,BOOK XI.,"star, and then again sinketh within the shadowy clouds, even so Hector"
6191,BOOK XI.,"would now appear among the foremost ranks, and again would be giving"
6192,BOOK XI.,"command in the rear, and all in bronze he shone, like the lightning of"
6193,BOOK XI.,aegis-bearing father Zeus.
6194,BOOK XI.,
6195,BOOK XI.,And even as when reapers over against each other drive their swaths
6196,BOOK XI.,"through a rich man’s field of wheat or barley, and thick fall the"
6197,BOOK XI.,"handfuls, even so the Trojans and Achaians leaped upon each other,"
6198,BOOK XI.,"destroying, and neither side took thought of ruinous flight; and equal"
6199,BOOK XI.,"heads had the battle, and they rushed on like wolves. And woful Discord"
6200,BOOK XI.,"was glad at the sight, for she alone of the gods was with them in the"
6201,BOOK XI.,"war; for the other gods were not beside them, but in peace they sat"
6202,BOOK XI.,"within their halls, where the goodly mansion of each was builded in the"
6203,BOOK XI.,"folds of Olympus. And they all were blaming the son of Kronos, lord of"
6204,BOOK XI.,"the storm-cloud, for that he willed to give glory to the Trojans. But"
6205,BOOK XI.,"of them took the father no heed, but aloof from the others he sat"
6206,BOOK XI.,"apart, glad in his glory, looking toward the city of the Trojans, and"
6207,BOOK XI.,"the ships of the Achaians, and the glitter of bronze, and the slayers"
6208,BOOK XI.,and the slain.
6209,BOOK XI.,
6210,BOOK XI.,"So long as morning was, and the sacred day still waxed, so long did the"
6211,BOOK XI.,"shafts of both hosts strike, and the folk fell, but about the hour when"
6212,BOOK XI.,"a woodman maketh ready his meal, in the dells of a mountain, when he"
6213,BOOK XI.,"hath tired his hands with felling tall trees, and weariness cometh on"
6214,BOOK XI.,"his soul, and desire of sweet food taketh his heart, even then the"
6215,BOOK XI.,"Danaans by their valour brake the battalions, and called on their"
6216,BOOK XI.,"comrades through the lines. And in rushed Agamemnon first of all, and"
6217,BOOK XI.,"slew a man, even Bienor, shepherd of the hosts, first himself, and next"
6218,BOOK XI.,"his comrade Oïleus, the charioteer. He verily leaped from the chariot"
6219,BOOK XI.,"and stood and faced Agamemnon, but the king smote the brow of him with"
6220,BOOK XI.,"the sharp spear as he came eagerly on, and his vizor heavy with bronze"
6221,BOOK XI.,"held not off the spear, but through vizor and bone it sped, and the"
6222,BOOK XI.,"brain within was all scattered, and so was Oïleus overcome despite his"
6223,BOOK XI.,eagerness.
6224,BOOK XI.,
6225,BOOK XI.,"And them did Agamemnon king of men leave in that place, with their"
6226,BOOK XI.,"breasts gleaming, when he had stripped them of their corslets, and he"
6227,BOOK XI.,"went on to destroy Isos and Antiphos, two sons of Priam, one born in"
6228,BOOK XI.,"wedlock, the other a bastard, and both were in one chariot: the bastard"
6229,BOOK XI.,"held the reins, but renowned Antiphos was fighting by him. These twain"
6230,BOOK XI.,"did Achilles on the spurs of Ida once bind with fresh withes, taking"
6231,BOOK XI.,"them as they herded the sheep, and he ransomed them for a price. But"
6232,BOOK XI.,"now Agamemnon, son of Atreus, of the wide domain, smote Isos on the"
6233,BOOK XI.,"breast, above the nipple, with his spear, but Antiphos he struck hard"
6234,BOOK XI.,"by the ear, with the sword, and dashed him from the chariot. Then made"
6235,BOOK XI.,"he haste, and stripped from them their goodly harness, well knowing who"
6236,BOOK XI.,"they were, for he had seen them before beside the fleet ships when"
6237,BOOK XI.,swift-footed Achilles led them from Ida. And as a lion easily crusheth
6238,BOOK XI.,"the young fawns of a swift hind, when that he hath seized them in his"
6239,BOOK XI.,"strong teeth, and hath come to their lair, and taketh their tender life"
6240,BOOK XI.,"away,—and the hind, even if she chance to be near at hand, cannot help"
6241,BOOK XI.,"them, for on herself too cometh dread terror, and swiftly she speedeth"
6242,BOOK XI.,"through the thick coppice and the woodland, hasting and sweating before"
6243,BOOK XI.,"the onslaught of the mighty beast,—even so not one of the Trojans did"
6244,BOOK XI.,"avail to save them from their bane, but themselves were fleeing in fear"
6245,BOOK XI.,before the Argives.
6246,BOOK XI.,
6247,BOOK XI.,"Next took he Peisandros and Hippolochos, steadfast in fight. These were"
6248,BOOK XI.,"sons of wise-hearted Antimachos, who chiefly had taken the gold of"
6249,BOOK XI.,"Alexandros, goodly gifts, and therefore never would consent to give"
6250,BOOK XI.,"Helen to fair-haired Menelaos. His two sons then lord Agamemnon took,"
6251,BOOK XI.,"both being in one car, and together they were driving the swift steeds;"
6252,BOOK XI.,"for the shining reins had fallen from their hands, and the horses were"
6253,BOOK XI.,"all distraught with dread, and he set on against them, like a"
6254,BOOK XI.,"lion,—even the son of Atreus,—but from their chariot the twain did"
6255,BOOK XI.,"supplicate him: “Take us alive, O son of Atreus, and receive worthy"
6256,BOOK XI.,"ransom, for in the halls of Antimachos lie many possessions, bronze,"
6257,BOOK XI.,"and gold, and smithied iron; out of these could our father do thee"
6258,BOOK XI.,"grace with ransom past telling, if he heard that we twain were alive by"
6259,BOOK XI.,the ships of the Achaians.”
6260,BOOK XI.,
6261,BOOK XI.,"So did the twain weeping beseech the king with soft words, but they"
6262,BOOK XI.,heard a voice wherein was no softness at all: “If indeed ye be the sons
6263,BOOK XI.,"of wise Antimachos, who once in the assembly of the Trojans bade slay"
6264,BOOK XI.,"Menelaos there, when he came on an embassy with godlike Odysseus, nor"
6265,BOOK XI.,"ever let him return to the Achaians, now verily shall ye pay the price"
6266,BOOK XI.,of your father’s foul shame.”
6267,BOOK XI.,
6268,BOOK XI.,"He spake and dashed Peisandros from his chariot to the earth, smiting"
6269,BOOK XI.,"him with the spear upon the breast, and he lay supine on the ground."
6270,BOOK XI.,"But Hippolochos rushed away, and him too he smote to earth, and cut off"
6271,BOOK XI.,"his arms and his neck with the sword, then tossed him like a ball of"
6272,BOOK XI.,"stone to roll through the throng. Then left he them, and where thickest"
6273,BOOK XI.,"clashed the battalions, there he set on, and with him all the"
6274,BOOK XI.,well-greaved Achaians. Footmen kept slaying footmen as they were driven
6275,BOOK XI.,"in flight, and horsemen slaying horsemen with the sword, and from"
6276,BOOK XI.,"beneath them rose up the dust from the plain, stirred by the thundering"
6277,BOOK XI.,"hooves of horses. And the lord Agamemnon, ever slaying, followed after,"
6278,BOOK XI.,calling on the Argives. And as when ruinous fire falleth on dense
6279,BOOK XI.,"woodland, and the whirling wind beareth it everywhere, and the thickets"
6280,BOOK XI.,"fall utterly before it, being smitten by the onset of the fire, even so"
6281,BOOK XI.,beneath Agamemnon son of Atreus fell the heads of the Trojans as they
6282,BOOK XI.,fled; and many strong-necked horses rattled empty cars along the
6283,BOOK XI.,"highways of the battle, lacking their noble charioteers; but they on"
6284,BOOK XI.,"the earth were lying, far more dear to the vultures than to their"
6285,BOOK XI.,wives.
6286,BOOK XI.,
6287,BOOK XI.,"But Hector did Zeus draw forth from the darts and the dust, from the"
6288,BOOK XI.,"man-slaying, and the blood, and the din, and the son of Atreus followed"
6289,BOOK XI.,"on, crying eagerly to the Danaans. And past the tomb of ancient Ilos,"
6290,BOOK XI.,"son of Dardanos, across the mid plain, past the place of the wild"
6291,BOOK XI.,"fig-tree they sped, making for the city, and ever the son of Atreus"
6292,BOOK XI.,"followed shouting, and his invincible hands were defiled with gore. But"
6293,BOOK XI.,"when they were come to the Skaian gates, and the oak-tree, there then"
6294,BOOK XI.,"they halted, and awaited each other. But some were still in full flight"
6295,BOOK XI.,"through the mid plain, like kine that a lion hath scattered, coming on"
6296,BOOK XI.,"them in the dead of night; all hath he scattered, but to one sheer"
6297,BOOK XI.,"death appeareth instantly, and he breaketh her neck first, seizing her"
6298,BOOK XI.,"with strong teeth, and thereafter swalloweth greedily the blood and all"
6299,BOOK XI.,the guts; even so lord Agamemnon son of Atreus followed hard on the
6300,BOOK XI.,"Trojans, ever slaying the hindmost man, and they were scattered in"
6301,BOOK XI.,"flight, and on face or back many of them fell from their chariots"
6302,BOOK XI.,"beneath the hands of Agamemnon, for mightily he raged with the spear."
6303,BOOK XI.,"But when he was now about coming below the city, and the steep wall,"
6304,BOOK XI.,then did the father of men and gods sit him down on the crests of
6305,BOOK XI.,"many-fountained Ida, from heaven descending, with the thunderbolt in"
6306,BOOK XI.,his hands.
6307,BOOK XI.,
6308,BOOK XI.,"Then sent he forth Iris of the golden wings, to bear his word: “Up and"
6309,BOOK XI.,"go, swift Iris, and tell this word unto Hector: So long as he sees"
6310,BOOK XI.,"Agamemnon, shepherd of the host, raging among the foremost fighters,"
6311,BOOK XI.,"and ruining the ranks of men, so long let him hold back, but bid the"
6312,BOOK XI.,"rest of the host war with the foe in strong battle. But when, or"
6313,BOOK XI.,"smitten with the spear or wounded with arrow shot, Agamemnon leapeth"
6314,BOOK XI.,"into his chariot, then will I give Hector strength to slay till he come"
6315,BOOK XI.,"even to the well-timbered ships, and the sun go down, and sacred"
6316,BOOK XI.,darkness draw on.”
6317,BOOK XI.,
6318,BOOK XI.,"So spake he, and wind-footed swift Iris disobeyed him not, but she went"
6319,BOOK XI.,"down from the hills of Ida to sacred Ilios, and she found the son of"
6320,BOOK XI.,"wise-hearted Priam, noble Hector, standing among the horses, and"
6321,BOOK XI.,"firm-bound chariots, and swift-footed Iris drew near and spake to him:"
6322,BOOK XI.,"“Hector, son of Priam, peer of Zeus in counsel; lo, Zeus the father"
6323,BOOK XI.,"hath sent me forth, to bear thee this command: So long as thou seest"
6324,BOOK XI.,"Agamemnon, the shepherd of the host, raging among the foremost"
6325,BOOK XI.,"fighters, and ruining the ranks of men, so long hold back from the"
6326,BOOK XI.,"fight, but bid the rest of the host war with the foe in strong battle."
6327,BOOK XI.,"But when, or smitten with the spear or wounded with arrow shot,"
6328,BOOK XI.,"Agamemnon leapeth into his chariot, then will Zeus give thee strength"
6329,BOOK XI.,"to slay till thou come even to the well-timbered ships, and the sun go"
6330,BOOK XI.,down and sacred darkness draw on.”
6331,BOOK XI.,
6332,BOOK XI.,"So spake swift-footed Iris and departed, but Hector with his harness"
6333,BOOK XI.,"leaped from the chariot to the ground, and, shaking his sharp spears"
6334,BOOK XI.,"went through all the host, stirring up his men to fight, and he roused"
6335,BOOK XI.,"the dread din of battle. And they wheeled round, and stood and faced"
6336,BOOK XI.,"the Achaians, while the Argives on the other side strengthened their"
6337,BOOK XI.,"battalions. And battle was made ready, and they stood over against each"
6338,BOOK XI.,"other, and Agamemnon first rushed in, being eager to fight far in front"
6339,BOOK XI.,of all.
6340,BOOK XI.,
6341,BOOK XI.,"Tell me now, ye Muses that inhabit mansions in Olympus, who was he that"
6342,BOOK XI.,"first encountered Agamemnon, whether of the Trojans themselves, or of"
6343,BOOK XI.,"their allies renowned? It was Iphidamas, son of Antenor, great and"
6344,BOOK XI.,"mighty, who was nurtured in Thrace rich of soil, the mother of sheep,"
6345,BOOK XI.,"and Kisses his mother’s father reared him in the halls, while he was"
6346,BOOK XI.,"but a little child,—even the father of Theano fair of face. Then when"
6347,BOOK XI.,"he came to the measure of glorious youth, he tried to keep him there,"
6348,BOOK XI.,"and offered him his own daughter; but a bridegroom new wed, he went"
6349,BOOK XI.,from his bridal chamber after the tidings of the coming of the
6350,BOOK XI.,"Achaians, with twelve beaked ships that followed after him. These trim"
6351,BOOK XI.,"ships he left in Perkote, but himself came by land to Ilios; he it was"
6352,BOOK XI.,that then encountered Agamemnon son of Atreus. And when they were come
6353,BOOK XI.,"near in onset against each other, Atreus’ son missed, and his spear was"
6354,BOOK XI.,"turned aside, but Iphidamas smote him on the girdle, below the corslet,"
6355,BOOK XI.,"and himself pressed on, trusting to his heavy hand, but pierced not the"
6356,BOOK XI.,"gleaming girdle, for long ere that the point struck on the silver, and"
6357,BOOK XI.,was bent like lead. Then wide-ruling Agamemnon caught the spear with
6358,BOOK XI.,"his hand and drew it toward him furiously, like a lion, and snatched it"
6359,BOOK XI.,"out of the hand of Iphidamas, and smote his neck with the sword, and"
6360,BOOK XI.,"unstrung his limbs. So even there he fell, and slept a sleep of bronze"
6361,BOOK XI.,"most piteously, far from his wedded wife, helping the folk of the"
6362,BOOK XI.,"city,—far from his bride, of whom he had known no joy, and much had he"
6363,BOOK XI.,"given for her: first a hundred kine he gave, and thereafter promised a"
6364,BOOK XI.,"thousand, goats and sheep together, whereof he had herds unspeakable."
6365,BOOK XI.,"Then did Agamemnon son of Atreus strip him, and went bearing his goodly"
6366,BOOK XI.,harness into the throng of the Achaians.
6367,BOOK XI.,
6368,BOOK XI.,"Now when Koön beheld him, Koön Antenor’s eldest son, illustrious among"
6369,BOOK XI.,"men, strong sorrow came on him, covering his eyes, for his brother’s"
6370,BOOK XI.,"fall: and he stood on one side with his spear, and unmarked of noble"
6371,BOOK XI.,"Agamemnon smote him on the mid-arm, beneath the elbow, and clean"
6372,BOOK XI.,through went the point of the shining spear. Then Agamemnon king of men
6373,BOOK XI.,"shuddered, yet not even so did he cease from battle and war, but rushed"
6374,BOOK XI.,"against Koön, grasping his wind-nurtured spear. Verily then Koön seized"
6375,BOOK XI.,"right lustily by the foot Iphidamas, his brother, and his father’s son,"
6376,BOOK XI.,"and called to all the best of his men; but him, as he dragged the dead"
6377,BOOK XI.,"through the press, beneath his bossy shield Agamemnon wounded with a"
6378,BOOK XI.,"bronze-shod spear, and unstrung his limbs, and drew near and cut off"
6379,BOOK XI.,"his head over Iphidamas. There the sons of Antenor, at the hands of"
6380,BOOK XI.,"Agamemnon the king, filled up the measure of their fate, and went down"
6381,BOOK XI.,within the house of Hades.
6382,BOOK XI.,
6383,BOOK XI.,"But Agamemnon ranged among the ranks of men, with spear, and sword, and"
6384,BOOK XI.,"great stones for throwing, while yet the blood welled warm from his"
6385,BOOK XI.,"wound. But when the wound waxed dry, and the blood ceased to flow, then"
6386,BOOK XI.,keen pangs came on the might of the son of Atreus. And even as when the
6387,BOOK XI.,"keen shaft cometh upon a woman in her travail, the piercing shaft that"
6388,BOOK XI.,"the goddesses of the birth-pangs send, even the Eilithyiai, the"
6389,BOOK XI.,"daughters of Hera that have hitter pangs in their gift, even so keen"
6390,BOOK XI.,pains sank into the might of the son of Atreus. Then leaped he into his
6391,BOOK XI.,"chariot, and bade his charioteer drive to the hollow ships, for he was"
6392,BOOK XI.,"sore vexed at heart. And he called in a piercing voice, and shouted to"
6393,BOOK XI.,"the Danaans: “O friends, leaders and counsellors of the Argives, do ye"
6394,BOOK XI.,"now ward from the seafaring ships the harsh din of battle, for Zeus the"
6395,BOOK XI.,counsellor suffers me not all day to war with the Trojans.”
6396,BOOK XI.,
6397,BOOK XI.,"So spake he, and his charioteer lashed the fair-maned steeds toward the"
6398,BOOK XI.,"hollow ships, and they flew onward nothing loth, and their breasts were"
6399,BOOK XI.,"covered with foam, and their bellies were stained with dust, as they"
6400,BOOK XI.,bore the wounded king away from the war.
6401,BOOK XI.,
6402,BOOK XI.,"But Hector, when he beheld Agamemnon departed, cried to the Trojans and"
6403,BOOK XI.,"Lykians with a loud shout: “Ye Trojans and Lykians, and Dardanians that"
6404,BOOK XI.,"war in close fight, be men, my friends, and be mindful of your"
6405,BOOK XI.,impetuous valour. The best man of them hath departed and to me hath
6406,BOOK XI.,"Zeus, the son of Kronos, given great renown. But straightway drive ye"
6407,BOOK XI.,"the whole-hooved horses against the mighty Danaans, that ye may be the"
6408,BOOK XI.,masters and bear away the higher glory.”
6409,BOOK XI.,
6410,BOOK XI.,"So spake he, and aroused the might and spirit of every man. And even as"
6411,BOOK XI.,when some hunter tars on his white-toothed hounds against a boar of the
6412,BOOK XI.,"wild, or a lion, even so did Hector, son of Priam, like unto Ares the"
6413,BOOK XI.,"bane of men, tar on the great-hearted Trojans against the Achaians."
6414,BOOK XI.,"Himself with high thoughts he fared among the foremost, and fell upon"
6415,BOOK XI.,"the fight; like a roaring blast, that leapeth down and stirreth the"
6416,BOOK XI.,"violet-coloured deep. There whom first, whom last did he slay, even"
6417,BOOK XI.,"Hector, son of Priam, when Zeus vouchsafed him renown?"
6418,BOOK XI.,
6419,BOOK XI.,"Asaios first, and Autonoos, and Opites, and Dolops, son of Klytios, and"
6420,BOOK XI.,"Opheltios, and Agelaos, and Aisymnos, and Oros, and Hipponoos steadfast"
6421,BOOK XI.,"in the fight; these leaders of the Danaans he slew, and thereafter"
6422,BOOK XI.,"smote the multitude, even as when the West Wind driveth the clouds of"
6423,BOOK XI.,"the white South Wind, smiting with deep storm, and the wave swelleth"
6424,BOOK XI.,"huge, rolling onward, and the spray is scattered on high beneath the"
6425,BOOK XI.,rush of the wandering wind; even so many heads of the host were smitten
6426,BOOK XI.,by Hector.
6427,BOOK XI.,
6428,BOOK XI.,"There had ruin begun, and deeds remedeless been wrought, and now would"
6429,BOOK XI.,"all the Achaians have fled and fallen among the ships, if Odysseus had"
6430,BOOK XI.,"not called to Diomedes, son of Tydeus: “Tydeus’ son, what ails us that"
6431,BOOK XI.,"we forget our impetuous valour? Nay, come hither, friend, and take thy"
6432,BOOK XI.,"stand by me, for verily it will be shame if Hector of the glancing helm"
6433,BOOK XI.,take the ships.”
6434,BOOK XI.,
6435,BOOK XI.,And to him strong Diomedes spake in answer: “Verily will I abide and
6436,BOOK XI.,"endure, but short will be all our profit, for Zeus, the cloud-gatherer,"
6437,BOOK XI.,clearly desireth to give victory to the Trojans rather than to us.”
6438,BOOK XI.,
6439,BOOK XI.,"He spake, and drave Thymbraios from his chariot to the ground, smiting"
6440,BOOK XI.,"him with the spear in the left breast, and Odysseus smote Molion the"
6441,BOOK XI.,"god-like squire of that prince. These then they let be, when they had"
6442,BOOK XI.,"made them cease from war, and then the twain fared through the crowd"
6443,BOOK XI.,"with a din, as when two boars full of valour fall on the hunting"
6444,BOOK XI.,"hounds; so rushed they on again, and slew the Trojans, while gladly the"
6445,BOOK XI.,Achaians took breath again in their flight from noble Hector.
6446,BOOK XI.,
6447,BOOK XI.,"There took they a chariot and two of the best men of the people, two"
6448,BOOK XI.,"sons of Merops of Perkote, who above all men was skilled in"
6449,BOOK XI.,"soothsaying, nor would he suffer his children to go to ruinous war; but"
6450,BOOK XI.,"in nowise did the twain obey him, for the Fates of black death led them"
6451,BOOK XI.,"on. Them did the son of Tydeus, Diomedes, spearman renowned, deprive of"
6452,BOOK XI.,"life and spirit, and took away their glorious harness. And Odysseus"
6453,BOOK XI.,stripped Hippodamos and Hypeirochos. Then Kronion stretched for them
6454,BOOK XI.,"the line of battle level, as he looked down from Ida, and they kept"
6455,BOOK XI.,"slaying each other. Then Tydeus’ son smote the hero Agastrophos, son of"
6456,BOOK XI.,"Paion, on the hip-joint, with his spear; nor were his horses near, for"
6457,BOOK XI.,"him to flee, and great blindness was on his spirit; for the squire held"
6458,BOOK XI.,"them aloof, but on foot he was charging through the foremost fighters,"
6459,BOOK XI.,"till he lost his life. But Hector quickly spied them among the ranks,"
6460,BOOK XI.,"and rushed upon them shouting, and with him followed the battalions of"
6461,BOOK XI.,"the Trojans. And beholding him, Diomedes of the loud war-cry shuddered,"
6462,BOOK XI.,"and straightway spake to Odysseus that was hard by: “Lo, on us this"
6463,BOOK XI.,"ruin, even mighty Hector, is rolling: let us stand, and await him, and"
6464,BOOK XI.,ward off his onset.”
6465,BOOK XI.,
6466,BOOK XI.,"So spake he, and swayed and sent forth his far-shadowing spear, and"
6467,BOOK XI.,"smote him nor missed, for he aimed at the head, on the summit of the"
6468,BOOK XI.,"crest, and bronze by bronze was turned, nor reached his fair flesh, for"
6469,BOOK XI.,"it was stopped by the threefold helm with its socket, that Phoebus"
6470,BOOK XI.,"Apollo to Hector gave. But Hector sprang back a wondrous way, and"
6471,BOOK XI.,"mingled with the throng, and he rested, fallen on his knee, and leaned"
6472,BOOK XI.,"on the ground with his stout hand, and dark night veiled his eyes."
6473,BOOK XI.,
6474,BOOK XI.,"But while Tydeus’ son was following after his spear-cast, far through"
6475,BOOK XI.,"the foremost fighters, where he saw it sink into the earth, Hector gat"
6476,BOOK XI.,"breath again, and leaping back into his chariot drave out into the"
6477,BOOK XI.,"throng, and avoided black Fate. Then rushing on with his spear mighty"
6478,BOOK XI.,"Diomedes spake to him: “Dog, thou art now again escaped from death; yet"
6479,BOOK XI.,"came ill very nigh thee: but now hath Phoebus Apollo saved thee, to"
6480,BOOK XI.,whom thou must surely pray when thou goest amid the clash of spears.
6481,BOOK XI.,"Verily I will slay thee yet when I meet thee hereafter, if any god is"
6482,BOOK XI.,"helper of me too. Now will I make after the rest, whomsoever I may"
6483,BOOK XI.,seize.”
6484,BOOK XI.,
6485,BOOK XI.,"So spake he, and stripped the son of Paeon, spearman renowned. But"
6486,BOOK XI.,"Alexandros, the lord of fair-tressed Helen, aimed with his arrows at"
6487,BOOK XI.,"Tydeides, shepherd of the host; leaning as he aimed against a pillar on"
6488,BOOK XI.,"the barrow, by men fashioned, of Ilos, son of Dardanos, an elder of the"
6489,BOOK XI.,people in time gone by. Now Diomedes was stripping the shining corslet
6490,BOOK XI.,"of strong Agastrophos from about his breast, and the shield from his"
6491,BOOK XI.,"shoulders, and his strong helmet, when Paris drew the centre of his"
6492,BOOK XI.,"bow; nor vainly did the shaft fly from his hand, for he smote the flat"
6493,BOOK XI.,"of the right foot of Diomedes, and the arrow went clean through, and"
6494,BOOK XI.,stood fixed in the earth; and right sweetly laughing Paris leaped up
6495,BOOK XI.,"from his lair, and boasted, and said: “Thou art smitten, nor vainly"
6496,BOOK XI.,hath the dart flown forth; would that I had smitten thee in the nether
6497,BOOK XI.,"belly, and taken thy life away. So should the Trojans have breathed"
6498,BOOK XI.,"again from their trouble, they that shudder at thee, as bleating goats"
6499,BOOK XI.,at a lion.”
6500,BOOK XI.,
6501,BOOK XI.,"But him answered strong Diomedes, no wise dismayed: “Bowman, reviler,"
6502,BOOK XI.,"proud in thy bow of horn*, thou gaper after girls, verily if thou"
6503,BOOK XI.,"madest trial in full harness, man to man, thy bow and showers of shafts"
6504,BOOK XI.,"would nothing avail thee, but now thou boastest vainly, for that thou"
6505,BOOK XI.,"hast grazed the sole of my foot. I care not, more than if a woman had"
6506,BOOK XI.,"struck me or a senseless boy, for feeble is the dart of a craven man"
6507,BOOK XI.,"and a worthless. In other wise from my hand, yea, if it do but touch,"
6508,BOOK XI.,"the sharp shaft flieth, and straightway layeth low its man, and torn"
6509,BOOK XI.,"are the cheeks of his wife, and fatherless his children, and he,"
6510,BOOK XI.,"reddening the earth with his blood, doth rot away, more birds than"
6511,BOOK XI.,women round him.”
6512,BOOK XI.,
6513,BOOK XI.,"* Or, rather, “resplendent with thy lovelock.”"
6514,BOOK XI.,
6515,BOOK XI.,
6516,BOOK XI.,"So spake he, and Odysseus, spearman renowned, drew near, and stood in"
6517,BOOK XI.,"front of him, and Diomedes sat down behind him, and drew the sharp"
6518,BOOK XI.,"arrow from his foot, and a sore pang passed through his flesh. Then"
6519,BOOK XI.,"sprang he into his car, and bade his charioteer drive back to the"
6520,BOOK XI.,"hollow ships, for he was hurt at heart. Then Odysseus, spearman"
6521,BOOK XI.,"renowned, was left alone, nor did one of the Argives abide by him, for"
6522,BOOK XI.,fear had fallen on them all. Then in heaviness he spoke to his own
6523,BOOK XI.,"great-hearted spirit: “Ah me, what thing shall befall me! A great evil"
6524,BOOK XI.,"it is if I flee, in dread of the throng; yet worse is this, if I be"
6525,BOOK XI.,"taken all alone, for the other Danaans hath Kronion scattered in"
6526,BOOK XI.,flight. But wherefore doth my heart thus converse with herself? for I
6527,BOOK XI.,"know that they are cowards, who flee the fight, but whosoever is a hero"
6528,BOOK XI.,"in war, him it mainly behoves to stand stubbornly, whether he be"
6529,BOOK XI.,"smitten, or whether he smite another.”"
6530,BOOK XI.,
6531,BOOK XI.,"While he pondered thus in heart and spirit, the ranks came on of the"
6532,BOOK XI.,"Trojans under shield, and hemmed him in the midst, setting among them"
6533,BOOK XI.,their own bane. And even as when hounds and young men in their bloom
6534,BOOK XI.,"press round a boar, and he cometh forth from his deep lair, whetting"
6535,BOOK XI.,"his white tusk between crooked jaws, and round him they rush, and the"
6536,BOOK XI.,"sound of the gnashing of tusks ariseth, and straightway they await his"
6537,BOOK XI.,"assault, so dread as he is, even so then round Odysseus, dear to Zeus,"
6538,BOOK XI.,"rushed the Trojans. And first he wounded noble Deïopites, from above,"
6539,BOOK XI.,"in the shoulder, leaping on him with sharp spear, and next he slew"
6540,BOOK XI.,"Thoon and Ennomos, and next Chersidamas, being leapt down from his"
6541,BOOK XI.,"chariot, he smote with the spear on the navel beneath the bossy shield,"
6542,BOOK XI.,and he fell in the dust and clutched the ground with the hollow of his
6543,BOOK XI.,"hand. These left he, and wounded Charops, son of Hippasos, with the"
6544,BOOK XI.,"spear, the brother of high-born Sokos. And to help him came Sokos, a"
6545,BOOK XI.,"godlike man, and stood hard by him, and spake saying: “O renowned"
6546,BOOK XI.,"Odysseus, insatiable of craft and toil, to-day shalt thou either boast"
6547,BOOK XI.,"over two sons of Hippasos, as having slain two such men of might, and"
6548,BOOK XI.,"stripped their harness, or smitten by my spear shalt lose thy life.”"
6549,BOOK XI.,
6550,BOOK XI.,"So spake he, and smote him on the circle of his shield; through the"
6551,BOOK XI.,"shining shield passed the strong spear, and through the fair-dight"
6552,BOOK XI.,"corslet it was thrust, and tore clean off the flesh of the flanks, but"
6553,BOOK XI.,"Pallas Athene did not suffer it to mingle with the bowels of the hero,"
6554,BOOK XI.,"and Odysseus knew that the dart had in nowise lighted on a deadly spot,"
6555,BOOK XI.,"and drawing backward, he spake unto Sokos: “Ah, wretched one, verily"
6556,BOOK XI.,sheer destruction is come upon thee. Surely thou hast made me to cease
6557,BOOK XI.,"from warring among the Trojans, but here to thee I declare that slaying"
6558,BOOK XI.,"and black Fate will be upon thee this day, and beneath my spear"
6559,BOOK XI.,"overthrown shalt thou give glory to me, and thy soul to Hades of the"
6560,BOOK XI.,noble steeds.”
6561,BOOK XI.,
6562,BOOK XI.,"He spake, and the other turned, and started to flee, and in his back as"
6563,BOOK XI.,"he turned he fixed the spear, between the shoulders, and drave it"
6564,BOOK XI.,"through the breast. Then he fell with a crash, and noble Odysseus"
6565,BOOK XI.,"boasted over him: “Ah, Sokos, son of wise-hearted Hippasos the tamer of"
6566,BOOK XI.,"horses, the end of death hath come upon and caught thee, nor hast thou"
6567,BOOK XI.,"avoided. Ah, wretch, thy father and lady mother shall not close thine"
6568,BOOK XI.,"eyes in death, but birds that eat flesh raw shall tear thee, shrouding"
6569,BOOK XI.,"thee in the multitude of their wings. But to me, if I die, the noble"
6570,BOOK XI.,Achaians will yet give due burial.”
6571,BOOK XI.,
6572,BOOK XI.,"So spake he, and drew the mighty spear of wise-hearted Sokos forth from"
6573,BOOK XI.,"his flesh, and from his bossy shield, and his blood flowed forth when"
6574,BOOK XI.,"the spear was drawn away, and afflicted his spirit. And the"
6575,BOOK XI.,"great-hearted Trojans when they beheld the blood of Odysseus, with"
6576,BOOK XI.,clamour through the throng came all together against him. But he gave
6577,BOOK XI.,"ground, and shouted unto his comrades: thrice he shouted then, as loud"
6578,BOOK XI.,"as man’s mouth might cry, and thrice did Menelaos dear to Zeus hear his"
6579,BOOK XI.,"call, and quickly he spake to Aias that was hard by him: “Aias, of the"
6580,BOOK XI.,"seed of Zeus, child of Telamon, lord of the hosts, the shout of"
6581,BOOK XI.,"Odysseus of the hardy heart rings round me, like as though the Trojans"
6582,BOOK XI.,"were oppressing him alone among them, and had cut him off in the strong"
6583,BOOK XI.,"battle. Nay, let us speed into the throng, for better it is to rescue"
6584,BOOK XI.,"him. I fear lest he suffer some evil, being alone among the Trojans, so"
6585,BOOK XI.,"brave as he is, and lest great sorrow for his loss come upon the"
6586,BOOK XI.,Danaans.”
6587,BOOK XI.,
6588,BOOK XI.,"So spake he, and led the way, and the other followed him, a godlike"
6589,BOOK XI.,"man. Then found they Odysseus dear to Zeus, and the Trojans beset him"
6590,BOOK XI.,"like tawny jackals from the hills round a wounded horned stag, that a"
6591,BOOK XI.,"man hath smitten with an arrow from the bow-string, and the stag hath"
6592,BOOK XI.,"fled from him by speed of foot, as long as the blood is warm and his"
6593,BOOK XI.,"limbs are strong, but when the swift arrow hath overcome him, then do"
6594,BOOK XI.,"the ravening jackals rend him in the hills, in a dark wood, and then"
6595,BOOK XI.,"god leadeth a murderous lion thither, and the jackals flee before him,"
6596,BOOK XI.,"but he rendeth them, so then, round wise-hearted Odysseus of the crafty"
6597,BOOK XI.,"counsels, did the Trojans gather, many and mighty, but that hero"
6598,BOOK XI.,thrusting on with the spear held off the pitiless day. Then Aias drew
6599,BOOK XI.,"near, bearing his shield like a tower, and stood thereby, and the"
6600,BOOK XI.,"Trojans fled from him, where each man might. Then warlike Menelaos led"
6601,BOOK XI.,"Odysseus out of the press, holding him by the hand, till the squire"
6602,BOOK XI.,drave up the horses.
6603,BOOK XI.,
6604,BOOK XI.,"Then Aias leaped on the Trojans, and slew Doyrklos, bastard son of"
6605,BOOK XI.,"Priam, and thereafter wounded he Pandokos, and he wounded Lysandros,"
6606,BOOK XI.,"and Pyrasos, and Pylartes. And as when a brimming river cometh down"
6607,BOOK XI.,"upon the plain, in winter flood from the hills, swollen by the rain of"
6608,BOOK XI.,"Zeus, and many dry oaks and many pines it sucketh in, and much soil it"
6609,BOOK XI.,"casteth into the sea, even so renowned Aias charged them, pursuing"
6610,BOOK XI.,"through the plain, slaying horses and men. Nor wist Hector thereof at"
6611,BOOK XI.,"all, for he was fighting on the left of all the battle, by the banks of"
6612,BOOK XI.,"the river Skamandros, whereby chiefly fell the heads of men, and an"
6613,BOOK XI.,"unquenchable cry arose, around great Nestor and warlike Idomeneus. And"
6614,BOOK XI.,"Hector with them was warring, and terrible things did he, with the"
6615,BOOK XI.,"spear and in horsemanship, and he ravaged the battalions of the young"
6616,BOOK XI.,"men. Nor would the noble Achaians have yet given ground from the path,"
6617,BOOK XI.,"if Alexandros, the lord of fair-tressed Helen, had not stayed Machaon"
6618,BOOK XI.,"shepherd of the host in his valorous deeds, and smitten him on the"
6619,BOOK XI.,"right shoulder with a three-barbed arrow. Therefore were the Achaians,"
6620,BOOK XI.,"breathing valour, in great fear, lest men should seize Machaon in the"
6621,BOOK XI.,turning of the fight.
6622,BOOK XI.,
6623,BOOK XI.,"Then Idomeneus spake to noble Nestor: “O Nestor, son of Neleus, great"
6624,BOOK XI.,"glory of the Achaians, arise, get thee up into thy chariot, and with"
6625,BOOK XI.,"thee let Machaon go, and swiftly drive to the ships the whole-hooved"
6626,BOOK XI.,"horses. For a leech is worth many other men, to cut out arrows, and"
6627,BOOK XI.,spread soothing medicaments.”
6628,BOOK XI.,
6629,BOOK XI.,"So spake he, nor did knightly Nestor of Gerenia disobey him, but"
6630,BOOK XI.,"straightway gat up into his chariot, and with him went Machaon, son of"
6631,BOOK XI.,"Asklepios the good leech, and he lashed the horses, and willingly flew"
6632,BOOK XI.,"they forward to the hollow ships, where they desired to be."
6633,BOOK XI.,
6634,BOOK XI.,"But Kebriones, the charioteer of Hector, beheld the Trojans driven in"
6635,BOOK XI.,"flight, and spake to him, and said: “Hector, here do we contend with"
6636,BOOK XI.,"the Danaans, at the limit of the wailful war, but, lo, the other"
6637,BOOK XI.,"Trojans are driven in flight confusedly, men and horses. And Aias son"
6638,BOOK XI.,"of Telamon is driving them; well I know him, for wide is the shield"
6639,BOOK XI.,"round his shoulders. Nay, let us too urge thither the horses and"
6640,BOOK XI.,"chariot, there where horsemen and footmen thickest in the forefront of"
6641,BOOK XI.,"evil strife are slaying each other, and the cry goes up unquenchable.”"
6642,BOOK XI.,
6643,BOOK XI.,"So spake he, and smote the fair-maned horses with the shrill-sounding"
6644,BOOK XI.,"whip, and they felt the lash, and fleetly bore the swift chariot among"
6645,BOOK XI.,"the Trojans and Achaians, treading on the dead, and the shields, and"
6646,BOOK XI.,"with blood was sprinkled all the axle-tree beneath, and the rims round"
6647,BOOK XI.,"the car with the drops from the hooves of the horses, and with drops"
6648,BOOK XI.,from the tires about the wheels. And Hector was eager to enter the
6649,BOOK XI.,"press of men, and to leap in and break through, and evil din of battle"
6650,BOOK XI.,"he brought among the Danaans, and brief space rested he from smiting"
6651,BOOK XI.,"with the spear. Nay, but he ranged among the ranks of other men, with"
6652,BOOK XI.,"spear, and sword, and with great stones, but he avoided the battle of"
6653,BOOK XI.,"Aias son of Telamon, [for Zeus would have been wroth with him, if he"
6654,BOOK XI.,fought with a better man than himself].
6655,BOOK XI.,
6656,BOOK XI.,"Now father Zeus, throned in the highest, roused dread in Aias, and he"
6657,BOOK XI.,"stood in amaze, and cast behind him his sevenfold shield of bull’s"
6658,BOOK XI.,"hide, and gazed round in fear upon the throng, like a wild beast,"
6659,BOOK XI.,"turning this way and that, and slowly retreating step by step. And as"
6660,BOOK XI.,when hounds and country folk drive a tawny lion from the mid-fold of
6661,BOOK XI.,"the kine, and suffer him not to carry away the fattest of the herd; all"
6662,BOOK XI.,"night they watch, and he in great desire for the flesh maketh his"
6663,BOOK XI.,"onset, but takes nothing thereby, for thick the darts fly from strong"
6664,BOOK XI.,"hands against him, and the burning brands, and these he dreads for all"
6665,BOOK XI.,"his fury, and in the dawn he departeth with vexed heart; even so at"
6666,BOOK XI.,"that time departed Aias, vexed at heart, from among the Trojans, right"
6667,BOOK XI.,"unwillingly, for he feared sore for the ships of the Achaians. And as"
6668,BOOK XI.,when a lazy ass going past a field hath the better of the boys with
6669,BOOK XI.,"him, an ass that hath had many a cudgel broken about his sides, and he"
6670,BOOK XI.,"fareth into the deep crop, and wasteth it, while the boys smite him"
6671,BOOK XI.,"with cudgels, and feeble is the force of them, but yet with might and"
6672,BOOK XI.,"main they drive him forth, when he hath had his fill of fodder, even so"
6673,BOOK XI.,"did the high-hearted Trojans and allies, called from many lands, smite"
6674,BOOK XI.,"great Aias, son of Telamon, with darts on the centre of his shield, and"
6675,BOOK XI.,ever followed after him. And Aias would now be mindful of his impetuous
6676,BOOK XI.,"valour, and turn again, and hold at bay the battalions of the"
6677,BOOK XI.,"horse-taming Trojans, and once more he would turn him again to flee."
6678,BOOK XI.,"Yet he hindered them all from making their way to the fleet ships, and"
6679,BOOK XI.,"himself stood and smote between the Trojans and the Achaians, and the"
6680,BOOK XI.,"spears from strong hands stuck some of them in his great shield, fain"
6681,BOOK XI.,"to win further, and many or ever they reached his white body stood fast"
6682,BOOK XI.,"halfway in the earth, right eager to sate themselves with his flesh."
6683,BOOK XI.,
6684,BOOK XI.,"But when Eurypylos, the glorious son of Euaimon, beheld him oppressed"
6685,BOOK XI.,"by showers of darts, he went and took his stand by him, and cast with"
6686,BOOK XI.,"his shining spear, and smote Apisaon, son of Phausios, shepherd of the"
6687,BOOK XI.,"host, in the liver, below the midriff, and straightway loosened his"
6688,BOOK XI.,"knees; and Eurypylos sprang on him, and stripped the harness from his"
6689,BOOK XI.,shoulders.
6690,BOOK XI.,
6691,BOOK XI.,But when godlike Alexandros beheld him stripping the harness from
6692,BOOK XI.,"Apisaon, straightway he drew his bow against Eurypylos, and smote him"
6693,BOOK XI.,"with a shaft on the right thigh, and the reed of the shaft brake, and"
6694,BOOK XI.,weighed down the thigh. Then Eurypylos withdrew back into the host of
6695,BOOK XI.,"his comrades, avoiding fate, and with a piercing voice he shouted to"
6696,BOOK XI.,"the Danaans: “O friends, leaders and counsellors of the Argives, turn"
6697,BOOK XI.,"and stand and ward off the pitiless day from Aias, that is oppressed"
6698,BOOK XI.,"with darts, nor methinks will he escape out of the evil din of battle."
6699,BOOK XI.,"Nay, stand ye the rather at bay round great Aias, son of Telamon.”"
6700,BOOK XI.,
6701,BOOK XI.,"So spake Eurypylos being wounded, and they stood close together beside"
6702,BOOK XI.,"him, sloping the shields on their shoulders, and holding up their"
6703,BOOK XI.,"spears, and Aias came to meet them, and turned and stood when he"
6704,BOOK XI.,reached the host of his comrades.
6705,BOOK XI.,
6706,BOOK XI.,So they fought like unto burning fire.
6707,BOOK XI.,
6708,BOOK XI.,"But the mares of Neleus all sweating bare Nestor out of the battle, and"
6709,BOOK XI.,"also carried they Machaon, shepherd of the host. Then the noble"
6710,BOOK XI.,"Achilles, swift of foot, beheld and was ware of him, for Achilles was"
6711,BOOK XI.,"standing by the stern of his great ship, watching the dire toil, and"
6712,BOOK XI.,"the woful rout of battle. And straightway he spake to his own comrade,"
6713,BOOK XI.,"Patroklos, calling to him from beside the ship, and he heard, and from"
6714,BOOK XI.,"the hut he came, like unto Ares; and this to him was the beginning of"
6715,BOOK XI.,evil. Then the strong son of Menoitios spake first to Achilles: “Why
6716,BOOK XI.,"dost thou call me, Achilles, what need hast thou of me?”"
6717,BOOK XI.,
6718,BOOK XI.,Then swift-footed Achilles answered him and spake: “Noble son of
6719,BOOK XI.,"Menoitios, dear to my heart, now methinks that the Achaians will stand"
6720,BOOK XI.,"in prayer about my knees, for need no longer tolerable cometh upon"
6721,BOOK XI.,"them. But go now, Patroklos dear to Zeus, and ask Nestor who is this"
6722,BOOK XI.,that he bringeth wounded from the war. Verily from behind he is most
6723,BOOK XI.,"like Machaon, that child of Asklepios, but I beheld not the eyes of the"
6724,BOOK XI.,"man, for the horses sped past me, straining forward eagerly.”"
6725,BOOK XI.,
6726,BOOK XI.,"So spake he and Patroklos obeyed his dear comrade, and started and ran"
6727,BOOK XI.,"past the ships, and the huts of the Achaians."
6728,BOOK XI.,
6729,BOOK XI.,"Now when they came to the hut of the son of Neleus, they lighted down"
6730,BOOK XI.,"on the bounteous earth, and the squire, Eurymedon, loosed the horses of"
6731,BOOK XI.,"that old man from the car, and they dried the sweat from their"
6732,BOOK XI.,"doublets, standing before the breeze, by the shore of the sea, and"
6733,BOOK XI.,"thereafter came they to the hut, and sat them down on chairs. And"
6734,BOOK XI.,"fair-tressed Hekamede mixed for them a mess, Hekamede that the old man"
6735,BOOK XI.,"won from Tenedos, when Achilles sacked it, and she was the daughter of"
6736,BOOK XI.,"great-hearted Arsinoos, and her the Achaians chose out for him, because"
6737,BOOK XI.,always in counsel he excelled them all. First she drew before them a
6738,BOOK XI.,"fair table, polished well, with feet of cyanus, and thereon a vessel of"
6739,BOOK XI.,"bronze, with onion, for relish to the drink, and pale honey, and the"
6740,BOOK XI.,"grain of sacred barley, and beside it a right goodly cup, that the old"
6741,BOOK XI.,"man brought from home, embossed with studs of gold, and four handles"
6742,BOOK XI.,"there were to it, and round each two golden doves were feeding, and to"
6743,BOOK XI.,the cup were two feet below. Another man could scarce have lifted the
6744,BOOK XI.,"cup from the table, when it was full, but Nestor the Old raised it"
6745,BOOK XI.,"easily. In this cup the woman, like unto the goddesses, mixed a mess"
6746,BOOK XI.,"for them, with Pramnian wine, and therein grated cheese of goats’ milk,"
6747,BOOK XI.,"with a grater of bronze, and scattered white barley thereover, and bade"
6748,BOOK XI.,"them drink, whenas she had made ready the mess."
6749,BOOK XI.,
6750,BOOK XI.,"So when the twain had drunk, and driven away parching thirst, they took"
6751,BOOK XI.,"their pleasure in discourse, speaking each to the other. Now Patroklos"
6752,BOOK XI.,"stood at the doors, a godlike man, and when the old man beheld him, he"
6753,BOOK XI.,"arose from his shining chair, and took him by the hand, and led him in,"
6754,BOOK XI.,"and bade him be seated. But Patroklos, from over against him, was for"
6755,BOOK XI.,"refusing, and spake and said: “No time to sit have I, old man,"
6756,BOOK XI.,"fosterling of Zeus, nor wilt thou persuade me. Revered and dreaded is"
6757,BOOK XI.,he that sent me forth to ask thee who this man is that thou bringest
6758,BOOK XI.,"home wounded. Nay, but I know myself, for I see Machaon, shepherd of"
6759,BOOK XI.,"the host. And now will I go back again, a messenger, to speak a word to"
6760,BOOK XI.,"Achilles. And well dost thou know, old man, fosterling of Zeus, how"
6761,BOOK XI.,terrible a man he is; lightly would he blame even one that is
6762,BOOK XI.,blameless.”
6763,BOOK XI.,
6764,BOOK XI.,Then knightly Nestor of Gerenia answered him again: “Wherefore is
6765,BOOK XI.,"Achilles thus sorry for the sons of the Achaians, for as many as are"
6766,BOOK XI.,wounded with darts? He knoweth not at all what grief hath arisen in the
6767,BOOK XI.,"camp: for the best men lie in the ships, wounded by shaft or smitten by"
6768,BOOK XI.,"spear. Wounded with the shaft is strong Diomedes, son of Tydeus, and"
6769,BOOK XI.,"smitten is Odysseus, spearman renowned, and Agamemnon, [and Eurypylos"
6770,BOOK XI.,"hath been shot with an arrow in the thigh], and this other have I but"
6771,BOOK XI.,"newly carried out of battle, wounded with an arrow from the bowstring."
6772,BOOK XI.,"But Achilles, for all his valiance, careth not for the Danaans, nor"
6773,BOOK XI.,pities them at all. Doth he wait till the fleet ships hard by the shore
6774,BOOK XI.,"shall burn, maugre the Archives, in the consuming fire, and till we be"
6775,BOOK XI.,slain one upon another? For my strength is no longer what it was before
6776,BOOK XI.,"in my supple limbs. Would that I were in such youth, and my might as"
6777,BOOK XI.,"steadfast, as when a strife was set between the Eleians and ourselves,"
6778,BOOK XI.,"about a raid on the kine; what time I slew Itymoneus, the brave son of"
6779,BOOK XI.,"Hypeirochos, a dweller in Elis, when I was driving the spoil. And in"
6780,BOOK XI.,fighting for his kine was he smitten in the foremost rank by a spear
6781,BOOK XI.,"from my hand, and he fell, and about him were the country folk in great"
6782,BOOK XI.,fear. And a prey exceeding abundant did we drive together out of the
6783,BOOK XI.,"plain, fifty herds of kine, and as many flocks of sheep, and as many"
6784,BOOK XI.,"droves of swine, and as many wide flocks of goats, and chestnut horses"
6785,BOOK XI.,"a hundred and fifty, all mares, and many with their foals at their"
6786,BOOK XI.,"feet. And these by night we drave within Neleian Pylos to the citadel,"
6787,BOOK XI.,"and Neleus was glad at heart, for that so much wealth came to me, the"
6788,BOOK XI.,"first time I went to war. And the heralds cried aloud, with the coming"
6789,BOOK XI.,"of the dawn, that all men should meet that had a debt owing to them in"
6790,BOOK XI.,goodly Elis. And the men that were leaders of the Pylians gathered
6791,BOOK XI.,"together and divided all, for to many did the Epeians owe a debt, for"
6792,BOOK XI.,"few we were, and oppressed, that dwelt in Pylos. For the mighty"
6793,BOOK XI.,"Herakles had come and oppressed us, in the former years, and all our"
6794,BOOK XI.,"best men were slain. For twelve sons were we of noble Neleus, whereof I"
6795,BOOK XI.,"alone was left, and all the others perished. And being lifted up with"
6796,BOOK XI.,"pride because of these things, the mail-clad Epeians did us despite,"
6797,BOOK XI.,"and devised deeds of violence. And out of the spoil that old man, even"
6798,BOOK XI.,"Neleus, took him a herd of kine, and a great flock of sheep, choosing"
6799,BOOK XI.,"three hundred, and the shepherds with them. For to him was a great debt"
6800,BOOK XI.,"owing in goodly Elis: four horses, winners of prizes, with their"
6801,BOOK XI.,"chariot had gone to the games, and were to run for a tripod; but these"
6802,BOOK XI.,"did Augeias, king of men, hold in bond in that place, but sent away the"
6803,BOOK XI.,driver sorrowing for the horses. By which words and deeds was the old
6804,BOOK XI.,"man angered, so he chose out much booty, uncountable, and the rest he"
6805,BOOK XI.,"gave to the people to divide, lest any man should depart deprived by"
6806,BOOK XI.,"him of his equal share. So we ordered each thing, and offered victims"
6807,BOOK XI.,to the gods about the city; and on the third day all the Eleians came
6808,BOOK XI.,"together, many men and whole-hooved horses in full array, and with them"
6809,BOOK XI.,"the two Moliones in their harness, being still but lads, nor yet well"
6810,BOOK XI.,"skilled in impetuous valour. Now there is a certain city, Thryoessa, a"
6811,BOOK XI.,"steep burg, far off on Alpheios, the uttermost city of sandy Pylos,"
6812,BOOK XI.,"round this they pitched their camp, being eager to raze it utterly. But"
6813,BOOK XI.,"when they had passed through all the plain, to us came Athene by night"
6814,BOOK XI.,"rushing down from Olympus, with the message that we should arm us. Nor"
6815,BOOK XI.,"were the folk unwilling that she gathered in Pylos, but right eager for"
6816,BOOK XI.,"war. Now Neleus would not suffer me to arm myself, but hid my horses"
6817,BOOK XI.,"away, for he deemed that I knew naught as yet of the deeds of war. Yet"
6818,BOOK XI.,"even so did I shine among our horsemen, on foot though I was, for so"
6819,BOOK XI.,"Athene led the fight. There is a river Minyeïos, that falleth into the"
6820,BOOK XI.,"sea near Arene, where the horsemen of us Pylians waited the fair dawn,"
6821,BOOK XI.,"and thither those ranks of footmen flowed onward. Thence in full array,"
6822,BOOK XI.,"and harnessed in our gear, we came at midday to the sacred stream of"
6823,BOOK XI.,Alpheios. There to Zeus pre-eminent in might we sacrificed goodly
6824,BOOK XI.,"victims, and a bull to Alpheios, and a bull to Poseidon, but to"
6825,BOOK XI.,"bright-eyed Athene a heifer of the herd, and thereafter took we supper"
6826,BOOK XI.,"in ranks throughout the camp, and lay down to sleep each man in his"
6827,BOOK XI.,"arms, about the streams of the river. Now the great-hearted Epeians"
6828,BOOK XI.,"were gathered round the citadel, being eager to sack it utterly. But"
6829,BOOK XI.,"ere that might be, there appeared unto them a great deed of war. For"
6830,BOOK XI.,"when the bright sun came up above the earth, we joined battle, with"
6831,BOOK XI.,"prayer to Zeus, and Athene. But when the strife of the Pylians and"
6832,BOOK XI.,"Epeians began, I was the first that slew a man, and got me his"
6833,BOOK XI.,"whole-hooved steeds,—the warrior Mulios was he, who had to wife"
6834,BOOK XI.,"fair-haired Agamede, the eldest daughter of Augeias, and she knew all"
6835,BOOK XI.,drugs that the wide earth nourisheth. Him as he came on I smote with a
6836,BOOK XI.,"bronze-shod spear, and he fell in the dust and I leaped into the car,"
6837,BOOK XI.,and stood among the foremost fighters. But the great-hearted Epeians
6838,BOOK XI.,"fled this way and that when they saw the man fall, even the leader of"
6839,BOOK XI.,"the horsemen, who excelled in battle. But I sprang upon them, like a"
6840,BOOK XI.,"black tempest, and fifty chariots I took, and beside each chariot two"
6841,BOOK XI.,"men bit the earth with their teeth, subdued beneath my spear. And now"
6842,BOOK XI.,"should I have overthrown the twin Moliones, sons of Aktor, if their"
6843,BOOK XI.,"sire, the Earthshaker of wide sway, had not saved them out of the"
6844,BOOK XI.,"battle, and covered them with a thick mist.* There Zeus gave great"
6845,BOOK XI.,"might to the Pylians, for we followed through the wide plain, slaying"
6846,BOOK XI.,"the foe and gathering their goodly arms, even till we brought our"
6847,BOOK XI.,"horses to Bouprasion, rich in wheat, and the rock Olenian, and where is"
6848,BOOK XI.,"the hill called the hill of Alision, whence Athene turned the people"
6849,BOOK XI.,"again. There slew I the last man and left him there, but the Achaians"
6850,BOOK XI.,"drave back their swift horses from Bouprasion to Pylos, and all gave"
6851,BOOK XI.,"praise, among the gods to Zeus, and among men to Nestor. Such was I, if"
6852,BOOK XI.,ever among men I was such an one. But Achilles is for reaping alone the
6853,BOOK XI.,"reward of his valour; surely methinks that he will repent, and lament"
6854,BOOK XI.,"sore when the host perisheth. O friend, surely Menoitios thus gave thee"
6855,BOOK XI.,"command, on that day when he sent thee out of Phthia to Agamemnon. And"
6856,BOOK XI.,"we twain were within the house, I and goodly Odysseus, and in the halls"
6857,BOOK XI.,heard we all things even as he commanded thee. For we had come to the
6858,BOOK XI.,"fair-set halls of Peleus, gathering the host throughout Achaia of the"
6859,BOOK XI.,"fair dames. There then we found the hero Menoitios within, and thee,"
6860,BOOK XI.,"and with thee Achilles. And Peleus the Old, the lord of horses, was"
6861,BOOK XI.,"burning the fat thighs of kine to Zeus, whose joy is in the thunder, in"
6862,BOOK XI.,"the precinct of his court, and held in his hand a chalice of gold,"
6863,BOOK XI.,pouring forth the bright wine upon the burning offerings. And ye were
6864,BOOK XI.,"busy about the flesh of the ox, and then stood we in the doorway, and"
6865,BOOK XI.,"Achilles leaped up in amazement, and took us by the hand, and led us"
6866,BOOK XI.,"in, and bade us be seated, and set before us well the entertainment of"
6867,BOOK XI.,"strangers, all that is their due. But when we had taken delight in"
6868,BOOK XI.,"eating and drinking, I began the discourse, and bade you follow with"
6869,BOOK XI.,"us, and ye were right eager, and those twain laid on you many commands."
6870,BOOK XI.,"Peleus the Old bade his son Achilles be ever the boldest in fight, and"
6871,BOOK XI.,"pre-eminent over others, but to thee did Menoitios thus give command,"
6872,BOOK XI.,"the son of Aktor: ‘My child, of lineage is Achilles higher than thou,"
6873,BOOK XI.,"and thou art elder, but in might he is better far. But do thou speak to"
6874,BOOK XI.,"him well a word of wisdom, and put it to him gently, and show him what"
6875,BOOK XI.,"things he should do, and he will obey thee to his profit.’ So did the"
6876,BOOK XI.,"old man give thee command, but thou art forgetful. Nay, but even now"
6877,BOOK XI.,"speak thou thus and thus to wise-hearted Achilles, if perchance he will"
6878,BOOK XI.,"obey thee. Who knows but that, God helping, thou mightst stir his"
6879,BOOK XI.,spirit with thy persuading? and good is the persuasion of a friend. But
6880,BOOK XI.,"if in his heart he be shunning some oracle of God, and his lady mother"
6881,BOOK XI.,"hath told him somewhat from Zeus, natheless let him send forth thee,"
6882,BOOK XI.,"and let the rest of the host of the Myrmidons follow with thee, if"
6883,BOOK XI.,perchance any light shall arise from thee to the Danaans; and let him
6884,BOOK XI.,"give thee his fair harness, to bear into the war, if perchance the"
6885,BOOK XI.,"Trojans may take thee for him, and withhold them from the strife, and"
6886,BOOK XI.,"the warlike sons of the Achaians might take breath, being wearied; for"
6887,BOOK XI.,"brief is the breathing time in battle. And lightly might ye, being"
6888,BOOK XI.,"unwearied, drive men wearied in the war unto the city, away from the"
6889,BOOK XI.,ships and the huts.”
6890,BOOK XI.,
6891,BOOK XI.,"* Aktor was the putative, Poseidon the real father of the Moliones."
6892,BOOK XI.,
6893,BOOK XI.,
6894,BOOK XI.,"So spake he, and roused his heart within his breast, and he started and"
6895,BOOK XI.,ran by the ships to Achilles of the seed of Aiakos. But when Patroklos
6896,BOOK XI.,"came in his running to the ships of godlike Odysseus, where was their"
6897,BOOK XI.,"assembly and place of law, and whereby also were their altars of the"
6898,BOOK XI.,"gods established, there did Eurypylos meet him, Euaimon’s son, of the"
6899,BOOK XI.,"seed of Zeus, wounded in the thigh with an arrow, and limping out of"
6900,BOOK XI.,"the battle. And sweat ran down streaming from his head and shoulders,"
6901,BOOK XI.,"and from his cruel wound the black blood was welling, but his mind was"
6902,BOOK XI.,unshaken. And the strong son of Menoitios had pity on him when he
6903,BOOK XI.,"beheld him, and lamenting he spake winged words: “Ah, wretched men, ye"
6904,BOOK XI.,"leaders and counsellors of the Danaans. How are ye now doomed, far from"
6905,BOOK XI.,"your friends and your own country, to feed full with your white fat the"
6906,BOOK XI.,"swift hounds in Troia! But come, tell me this, Eurypylos, hero and"
6907,BOOK XI.,"fosterling of Zeus, will the Achaians yet in any wise restrain mighty"
6908,BOOK XI.,"Hector, or will they perish even now, subdued beneath his spear?”"
6909,BOOK XI.,
6910,BOOK XI.,"And to him again did the wounded Eurypylos make answer: “No more,"
6911,BOOK XI.,"Patroklos of the seed of Zeus, will there be any defence of the"
6912,BOOK XI.,"Achaians, but they will fall among the black ships. For verily all of"
6913,BOOK XI.,"them, that afore were bravest, are lying in the ships wounded and"
6914,BOOK XI.,"smitten by the hands of the Trojans, whose strength is waxing always."
6915,BOOK XI.,"But me do thou succour, and lead me to the black ship, and cut the"
6916,BOOK XI.,"arrow out of my thigh, and wash away the black blood from it with warm"
6917,BOOK XI.,"water, and smear soft healing drugs thereover, these good herbs whereof"
6918,BOOK XI.,"they say that thou hast learned from Achilles, whom Cheiron taught, the"
6919,BOOK XI.,"most righteous of the Centaurs. For of the leeches, Podaleirios and"
6920,BOOK XI.,"Machaon, one methinks, is wounded in the huts, and himself hath need of"
6921,BOOK XI.,"a good leech, and the other on the plain abideth the keen battle of the"
6922,BOOK XI.,Trojans.”
6923,BOOK XI.,
6924,BOOK XI.,Then the strong son of Menoitios answered him again: “How should these
6925,BOOK XI.,"things be? what shall we do, hero Eurypylos? I am on my way to carry a"
6926,BOOK XI.,"saying to wise-hearted Achilles, even the command of Nestor of Gerenia,"
6927,BOOK XI.,"warden of the Achaians; nay, but not even so will I be heedless of thee"
6928,BOOK XI.,that art wounded.”
6929,BOOK XI.,
6930,BOOK XI.,"So spake he, and clasped the shepherd of the host below the breast, and"
6931,BOOK XI.,led him to the hut; and the squire when he beheld them cast on the
6932,BOOK XI.,"ground the skins of oxen. There he stretched him at length, and cut"
6933,BOOK XI.,"with a knife the sharp arrow from his thigh, and washed from it the"
6934,BOOK XI.,black blood with warm water. And thereon he cast a bitter root rubbing
6935,BOOK XI.,"it between his hands, a root that took pain away, and ended all his"
6936,BOOK XI.,"anguish, and the wound began to dry, and the blood ceased."
6937,BOOK XI.,

6941,BOOK XII.,BOOK XII.
6942,BOOK XII.,
6943,BOOK XII.,
6944,BOOK XII.,How the Trojans and allies broke within the wall of the Achaians.
6945,BOOK XII.,
6946,BOOK XII.,
6947,BOOK XII.,So in the huts the strong son of Menoitios was tending the wounded
6948,BOOK XII.,"Eurypylos, but still they fought confusedly, the Argives and Trojans."
6949,BOOK XII.,"Nor were the fosse of the Danaans and their wide wall above, long to"
6950,BOOK XII.,"protect them, the wall they had builded for defence of the ships, and"
6951,BOOK XII.,the fosse they had drawn round about; for neither had they given goodly
6952,BOOK XII.,"hecatombs to the gods, that it might guard with its bounds their swift"
6953,BOOK XII.,"ships, and rich spoil. Nay, maugre the deathless gods was it builded,"
6954,BOOK XII.,"wherefore it abode steadfast for no long time. While Hector yet lived,"
6955,BOOK XII.,"and yet Achilles kept his wrath, and unsacked was the city of Priam the"
6956,BOOK XII.,"king, so long the great wall of the Achaians likewise abode steadfast."
6957,BOOK XII.,"But when all the bravest of the Trojans died, and many of the"
6958,BOOK XII.,"Argives,—some were taken, and some were left,—and the city of Priam was"
6959,BOOK XII.,"sacked in the tenth year, and the Argives had gone back in their ships"
6960,BOOK XII.,"to their own dear country, then verily did Poseidon and Apollo take"
6961,BOOK XII.,"counsel to wash away the wall, bringing in the might of the rivers, of"
6962,BOOK XII.,"all that flow from the hills of Ida to the sea. Rhesos there was, and"
6963,BOOK XII.,"Heptaporos, and Karesos, and Rhodios, Grenikos, and Aisepos, and goodly"
6964,BOOK XII.,"Skamandros, and Simoeis, whereby many shields and helms fell in the"
6965,BOOK XII.,"dust, and the generation of men half divine; the mouths of all these"
6966,BOOK XII.,"waters did Phoebus Apollo turn together, and for nine days he drave"
6967,BOOK XII.,"their stream against the wall; and still Zeus rained unceasingly, that"
6968,BOOK XII.,the quicker he might mingle the wall with the salt sea. And the Shaker
6969,BOOK XII.,"of the earth, with his trident in his hands, was himself the leader,"
6970,BOOK XII.,and sent forth into the waves all the foundations of beams and stones
6971,BOOK XII.,"that the Achaians had laid with toil, and made all smooth by the strong"
6972,BOOK XII.,"current of the Hellespont, and covered again the great beach with sand,"
6973,BOOK XII.,"when he had swept away the wall, and turned the rivers back to flow in"
6974,BOOK XII.,"their channel, where of old they poured down their fair flow of water."
6975,BOOK XII.,
6976,BOOK XII.,So were Poseidon and Apollo to do in the aftertime; but then war and
6977,BOOK XII.,"the din of war sounded about the well-builded wall, and the beams of"
6978,BOOK XII.,"the towers rang beneath the strokes; while the Argives, subdued by the"
6979,BOOK XII.,"scourge of Zeus, were penned and driven in by the hollow ships, in"
6980,BOOK XII.,"dread of Hector, the mighty maker of flight, but he, as aforetime,"
6981,BOOK XII.,"fought like a whirlwind. And as when, among hounds and hunting men, a"
6982,BOOK XII.,"boar or lion wheeleth him about, raging in his strength, and these"
6983,BOOK XII.,"array themselves in fashion like a tower, and stand up against him,"
6984,BOOK XII.,casting many javelins from their hands; but never is his stout heart
6985,BOOK XII.,"confused nor afraid, and his courage is his bane, and often he wheeleth"
6986,BOOK XII.,"him about, and maketh trial of the ranks of men, and wheresoever he"
6987,BOOK XII.,"maketh onset there the ranks of men give way, even so Hector went and"
6988,BOOK XII.,"besought his comrades through the press, and spurred them on to cross"
6989,BOOK XII.,"the dyke. But his swift-footed horses dared not, but loud they neighed,"
6990,BOOK XII.,"standing by the sheer edge, for the wide fosse affrighted them, neither"
6991,BOOK XII.,"easy to leap from hard by, nor to cross, for overhanging banks stood"
6992,BOOK XII.,"round about it all on either hand, and above it was furnished with"
6993,BOOK XII.,"sharp stakes that the sons of the Achaians had planted there, thick set"
6994,BOOK XII.,"and great, a bulwark against hostile men. Thereby not lightly might a"
6995,BOOK XII.,"horse enter, drawing a well-wheeled chariot; but the footmen were"
6996,BOOK XII.,"eager, if they might accomplish it. Then Polydamas drew near valiant"
6997,BOOK XII.,"Hector, and spake to him: “Hector and ye other leaders of the Trojans"
6998,BOOK XII.,"and allies, foolishly do we drive our fleet horses through the dyke;"
6999,BOOK XII.,"nay right hard it is to cross, for sharp stakes stand in it, and over"
7000,BOOK XII.,against them the wall of the Achaians. Thereby none may go down and
7001,BOOK XII.,"fight in chariots, for strait is the place wherein, methinks, we might"
7002,BOOK XII.,come by a mischief. For if Zeus that thunders on high is utterly to
7003,BOOK XII.,"destroy them in his evil will, and is minded to help the Trojans,"
7004,BOOK XII.,"verily then I too would desire that even instantly this might be, that"
7005,BOOK XII.,the Achaians should perish here nameless far from Argos: but and if
7006,BOOK XII.,"they turn again, and we flee back from among the ships, and rush into"
7007,BOOK XII.,"the delved ditch, then methinks that not even one from among us to bear"
7008,BOOK XII.,the tidings will win back to the city before the force of the Achaians
7009,BOOK XII.,"when they rally. But come as I declare, let us all obey. Let our"
7010,BOOK XII.,"squires hold the horses by the dyke, while we being harnessed in our"
7011,BOOK XII.,"gear as foot soldiers follow all together with Hector, and the Achaians"
7012,BOOK XII.,"will not withstand us, if indeed the bands of death be made fast upon"
7013,BOOK XII.,them.”
7014,BOOK XII.,
7015,BOOK XII.,"So spake Polydamas, and his wise word pleased Hector well, and"
7016,BOOK XII.,straightway in his harness he leaped from his chariot to the ground.
7017,BOOK XII.,"Nor were the other Trojans gathered upon the chariots, but they all"
7018,BOOK XII.,"leaped forth, when they beheld goodly Hector. There each gave it into"
7019,BOOK XII.,"the charge of his own charioteer, to keep the horses orderly there by"
7020,BOOK XII.,"the fosse. And they divided, and arrayed themselves, and ordered in"
7021,BOOK XII.,five companies they followed with the leaders.
7022,BOOK XII.,
7023,BOOK XII.,"Now they that went with Hector and noble Polydamas, these were most,"
7024,BOOK XII.,"and bravest, and most were eager to break the wall, and fight by the"
7025,BOOK XII.,"hollow ships; and with them followed Kebriones for the third, for"
7026,BOOK XII.,"Hector had left another man with his chariot, a weaker warrior than"
7027,BOOK XII.,"Kebriones. The second company Paris led, and Alkathoos, and Agenor: and"
7028,BOOK XII.,"the third company Helenos led, and godlike Deiphobos,—two sons of"
7029,BOOK XII.,"Priam,—the third was the warrior Asios, Asios Hyrtakos’ son, whom his"
7030,BOOK XII.,"tall sorrel steeds brought out of Arisbe, from the river Selleëis. And"
7031,BOOK XII.,"of the fourth company was the brave son of Anchises leader, even"
7032,BOOK XII.,"Aineias; and with him were two sons of Antenor, Archelochos and Akamas,"
7033,BOOK XII.,both well skilled in all warfare.
7034,BOOK XII.,
7035,BOOK XII.,"And Sarpedon led the glorious allies, and to be with him he chose"
7036,BOOK XII.,"Glaukos and warlike Asteropaios, for they seemed to him to be"
7037,BOOK XII.,"manifestly the bravest of all after himself but he was excellent, yea,"
7038,BOOK XII.,above all the host. And these when they had arrayed one another with
7039,BOOK XII.,"well-fashioned shields of bulls’ hide, went straight and eager against"
7040,BOOK XII.,"the Danaans, nor deemed that they could longer resist them, but that"
7041,BOOK XII.,themselves should fall on the black ships.
7042,BOOK XII.,
7043,BOOK XII.,Then the rest of the Trojans and the far-famed allies obeyed the
7044,BOOK XII.,"counsel of blameless Polydamas, but Asios, son of Hyrtakos, leader of"
7045,BOOK XII.,"men, willed not to leave his horses there, and his squire the"
7046,BOOK XII.,"charioteer, but with them he drew near the swift ships, fond man! for"
7047,BOOK XII.,"never was he, avoiding evil Fates, to return, rejoicing in his horses"
7048,BOOK XII.,"and chariot, back from the ships to windy Ilios. Nay, ere that the Fate"
7049,BOOK XII.,"of ill name overshadowed him, by the spear of Idomeneus, the haughty"
7050,BOOK XII.,"son of Deukalion. For Asios went against the left flank of the ships,"
7051,BOOK XII.,whereby the Achaians returned out of the plain with chariots and
7052,BOOK XII.,"horses: there he drave through his horses and his car, nor found he the"
7053,BOOK XII.,"doors shut on the gates, and the long bar, but men were holding them"
7054,BOOK XII.,open if perchance they might save any of their comrades fleeing out of
7055,BOOK XII.,the battle towards the ships. Straight thereby held he his horses with
7056,BOOK XII.,"unswerving aim, and his men followed him, crying shrilly, for they"
7057,BOOK XII.,"deemed that the Achaians could no longer hold them off, but that"
7058,BOOK XII.,"themselves would fall on the black ships: fools, for in the gates they"
7059,BOOK XII.,"found two men of the bravest, the high-hearted sons of the warrior"
7060,BOOK XII.,"Lapithae, one the son of Peirithoos, strong Polypoites, and one"
7061,BOOK XII.,"Leonteus, peer of Ares the bane of men. These twain stood in front of"
7062,BOOK XII.,"the lofty gates, like high-crested oak trees in the hills, that for"
7063,BOOK XII.,"ever abide the wind and rain, firm fixed with roots great and long;"
7064,BOOK XII.,"even so these twain, trusting to the mightiness of their hands, abode"
7065,BOOK XII.,"the coming of great Asios, and fled not. But straight came the Trojans"
7066,BOOK XII.,"against the well-builded wall, holding their shields of dry bulls’ hide"
7067,BOOK XII.,"on high, with mighty clamour, round the prince Asios, and Iamenos, and"
7068,BOOK XII.,"Orestes, and Adamas, son of Asios, and Thoon, and Oinomaos. But the"
7069,BOOK XII.,"other twain for a while, being within the wall, urged the well-greaved"
7070,BOOK XII.,Achaians to fight for the ships; but when they saw the Trojans
7071,BOOK XII.,"assailing the wall, while the Danaans cried and turned in flight, then"
7072,BOOK XII.,"forth rushed the twain, and fought in front of the gates like wild"
7073,BOOK XII.,"boars that in the mountains abide the assailing crew of men and dogs,"
7074,BOOK XII.,"and charging on either flank they crush the wood around them, cutting"
7075,BOOK XII.,"it at the root, and the clatter of their tusks waxes loud, till one"
7076,BOOK XII.,smite them and take their life away: so clattered the bright bronze on
7077,BOOK XII.,"the breasts of the twain, as they were smitten in close fight, for"
7078,BOOK XII.,"right hardily they fought, trusting to the host above them, and to"
7079,BOOK XII.,their own strength.
7080,BOOK XII.,
7081,BOOK XII.,For the men above were casting with stones from the well-builded towers
7082,BOOK XII.,"in defence of themselves and of the huts, and of the swift-faring"
7083,BOOK XII.,"ships. And like snowflakes the stones fell earthward, flakes that a"
7084,BOOK XII.,"tempestuous wind, as it driveth the dark clouds, rains thickly down on"
7085,BOOK XII.,the bounteous earth: so thick fell the missiles from the hands of
7086,BOOK XII.,"Achaians and Trojans alike, and their helms rang harsh and their bossy"
7087,BOOK XII.,"shields, being smitten with mighty stones. Verily then Asios, son of"
7088,BOOK XII.,"Hyrtakos, groaned and smote both his thighs, and indignantly he spake:"
7089,BOOK XII.,"“Father Zeus, verily thou too dost greatly love a lie, for I deemed not"
7090,BOOK XII.,that the Achaian heroes could withstand our might and our hands
7091,BOOK XII.,"invincible. But they like wasps of nimble body, or bees that have made"
7092,BOOK XII.,"their dwellings in a rugged path, and leave not their hollow hold, but"
7093,BOOK XII.,"abide and keep the hunters at bay for the sake of their little ones,"
7094,BOOK XII.,"even so these men have no will to give ground from the gates, though"
7095,BOOK XII.,"they are but two, ere they slay or be slain.”"
7096,BOOK XII.,
7097,BOOK XII.,"So spake he, nor with his speech did he persuade the mind of Zeus, for"
7098,BOOK XII.,his will was to give renown to Hector.
7099,BOOK XII.,
7100,BOOK XII.,"[But the others were fighting about the other gates, and hard it were"
7101,BOOK XII.,"for me like a god to tell all these things, for everywhere around the"
7102,BOOK XII.,"wall of stone rose the fire divine; the Argives, for all their sorrow,"
7103,BOOK XII.,defending the ships of necessity; and all the gods were grieved at
7104,BOOK XII.,"heart, as many as were defenders of the Danaans in battle. And together"
7105,BOOK XII.,the Lapithae waged war and strife.]
7106,BOOK XII.,
7107,BOOK XII.,"There the son of Peirithoos, mighty Polypoites, smote Damasos with the"
7108,BOOK XII.,"spear, through the helmet with cheekpieces of bronze; nor did the"
7109,BOOK XII.,"bronze helm stay the spear, but the point of bronze brake clean through"
7110,BOOK XII.,"the bone, and all the brain within was scattered, and the spear"
7111,BOOK XII.,overcame him in his eagerness. Thereafter he slew Pylon and Ormenos.
7112,BOOK XII.,"And Leonteus of the stock of Ares smote Hippomachos, son of Antimachos,"
7113,BOOK XII.,"with the spear, striking him on the girdle. Then again he drew his"
7114,BOOK XII.,"sharp sword from the sheath, and smote Antiphates first in close fight,"
7115,BOOK XII.,"rushing on him through the throng, that he fell on his back on the"
7116,BOOK XII.,"ground; and thereafter he brought down Menon, and Iamenos, and Orestes"
7117,BOOK XII.,"one after the other, to the bounteous earth."
7118,BOOK XII.,
7119,BOOK XII.,"While they were stripping from these the shining arms, the young men"
7120,BOOK XII.,"who followed with Polydamas and Hector, they that were most in number"
7121,BOOK XII.,"and bravest, and most were eager to break the wall and set the ships on"
7122,BOOK XII.,"fire, these still stood doubtful by the fosse, for as they were eager"
7123,BOOK XII.,"to pass over a bird had appeared to them, an eagle of lofty flight,"
7124,BOOK XII.,skirting the host on the left hand. In its talons it bore a blood-red
7125,BOOK XII.,"monstrous snake, alive, and struggling still; yea, not yet had it"
7126,BOOK XII.,"forgotten the joy of battle, but writhed backward and smote the bird"
7127,BOOK XII.,"that held it on the breast, beside the neck, and the bird cast it from"
7128,BOOK XII.,"him down to the earth, in sore pain, and dropped it in the midst of the"
7129,BOOK XII.,throng; then with a cry sped away down the gusts of the wind. And the
7130,BOOK XII.,Trojans shuddered when they saw the gleaming snake lying in the midst
7131,BOOK XII.,of them; an omen of aegis-bearing Zeus.
7132,BOOK XII.,
7133,BOOK XII.,"Then verily Polydamas stood by brave Hector, and spake: “Hector, ever"
7134,BOOK XII.,"dost thou rebuke me in the assemblies, though I counsel wisely; since"
7135,BOOK XII.,"it by no means beseemeth one of the people to speak contrary to thee,"
7136,BOOK XII.,"in council or in war, but always to increase thy power; but now again"
7137,BOOK XII.,will I say all that seemeth to me to be best. Let us not advance and
7138,BOOK XII.,"fight with the Danaans for the ships. For even thus, methinks, the end"
7139,BOOK XII.,"will be, if indeed this bird hath come for the Trojans when they were"
7140,BOOK XII.,"eager to cross the dyke, this eagle of lofty flight, skirting the host"
7141,BOOK XII.,"on the left hand, bearing in his talons a blood-red monstrous snake,"
7142,BOOK XII.,"yet living; then straightway left he hold of him, before he reached his"
7143,BOOK XII.,"own nest, nor brought him home in the end to give to his nestlings."
7144,BOOK XII.,"Even so shall we, though we burst with mighty force the gates and wall"
7145,BOOK XII.,"of the Achaians, and the Achaians give ground, even so we shall return"
7146,BOOK XII.,in disarray from the ships by the way we came; for many of the Trojans
7147,BOOK XII.,"shall we leave behind, whom the Achaians will slay with the sword, in"
7148,BOOK XII.,defence of the ships. Even so would a soothsayer interpret that in his
7149,BOOK XII.,"heart had clear knowledge of omens, and whom the people obeyed.”"
7150,BOOK XII.,
7151,BOOK XII.,"Then Hector of the glancing helm lowered on him and said: “Polydamas,"
7152,BOOK XII.,"that thou speakest is no longer pleasing to me; yea, thou knowest how"
7153,BOOK XII.,to conceive another counsel better than this. But if thou verily
7154,BOOK XII.,"speakest thus in earnest, then the gods themselves have utterly"
7155,BOOK XII.,destroyed thy wits; thou that bidst us forget the counsels of
7156,BOOK XII.,"loud-thundering Zeus, that himself promised me, and confirmed with a"
7157,BOOK XII.,"nod of his head! But thou bidst us be obedient to birds long of wing,"
7158,BOOK XII.,"whereto I give no heed, nor take any care thereof, whether they fare to"
7159,BOOK XII.,"the right, to the dawn and to the sun, or to the left, to mist and"
7160,BOOK XII.,"darkness. Nay, for us, let us trust to the counsel of mighty Zeus, who"
7161,BOOK XII.,"is king over all mortals and immortals. One omen is best, to fight for"
7162,BOOK XII.,our own country. And wherefore dost thou fear war and battle? For if
7163,BOOK XII.,"all the rest of us be slain by the ships of the Argives, yet needst"
7164,BOOK XII.,"thou not fear to perish, for thy heart is not warlike, nor enduring in"
7165,BOOK XII.,"battle. But if thou dost hold aloof from the fight, or winnest any"
7166,BOOK XII.,"other with thy words to turn him from war, straightway by my spear"
7167,BOOK XII.,"shalt thou be smitten, and lose thy life.”"
7168,BOOK XII.,
7169,BOOK XII.,"So spake he, and led on, and they followed with a wondrous din; and"
7170,BOOK XII.,Zeus that joyeth in the thunder roused from the hills of Ida a blast of
7171,BOOK XII.,"wind, which bare the dust straight against the ships; and he made weak"
7172,BOOK XII.,"the heart of the Achaians, but gave renown to the Trojans and to"
7173,BOOK XII.,"Hector. Trusting then in his omens, and their might, they strove to"
7174,BOOK XII.,break the great wall of the Achaians. They dragged down the
7175,BOOK XII.,"machicolations of the towers, and overthrew the battlements, and heaved"
7176,BOOK XII.,"up the projecting buttresses, that the Achaians set first in the earth,"
7177,BOOK XII.,"to be the props of the towers. These they overthrew, and hoped to break"
7178,BOOK XII.,the wall of the Achaians. Nor even now did the Danaans give ground from
7179,BOOK XII.,"the path, but closed up the battlements with shields of bulls’ hides,"
7180,BOOK XII.,and cast from them at the foemen as they went below the walls.
7181,BOOK XII.,
7182,BOOK XII.,"Now the two Aiantes went everywhere on the towers, ever urging, and"
7183,BOOK XII.,arousing the courage of the Achaians. One they would accost with
7184,BOOK XII.,"honeyed words, another with hard words they would rebuke, whomsoever"
7185,BOOK XII.,"they saw utterly giving ground from the fight: “O friends, whosoever is"
7186,BOOK XII.,"eminent, or whosoever is of middle station among the Argives, ay, or"
7187,BOOK XII.,"lower yet, for in no wise are all men equal in war, now is there work"
7188,BOOK XII.,"for all, and this yourselves well know. Let none turn back to the"
7189,BOOK XII.,"ships, for that he hath heard one threatening aloud; nay, get ye"
7190,BOOK XII.,"forward, and cheer another on, if perchance Olympian Zeus, the lord of"
7191,BOOK XII.,"lightning, will grant us to drive back the assault, and push the foe to"
7192,BOOK XII.,the city.”
7193,BOOK XII.,
7194,BOOK XII.,"So these twain shouted in the front, and aroused the battle of the"
7195,BOOK XII.,"Achaians. But as flakes of snow fall thick on a winter day, when Zeus"
7196,BOOK XII.,"the Counsellor hath begun to snow, showing forth these arrows of his to"
7197,BOOK XII.,"men, and he hath lulled the winds, and he snoweth continually, till he"
7198,BOOK XII.,"hath covered the crests of the high hills, and the uttermost headlands,"
7199,BOOK XII.,"and the grassy plains, and rich tillage of men; and the snow is"
7200,BOOK XII.,"scattered over the havens and shores of the grey sea, and only the wave"
7201,BOOK XII.,"as it rolleth in keeps off the snow, but all other things are swathed"
7202,BOOK XII.,"over, when the shower of Zeus cometh heavily, so from both sides their"
7203,BOOK XII.,"stones flew thick, some towards the Trojans, and some from the Trojans"
7204,BOOK XII.,"against the Achaians, while both sides were smitten, and over all the"
7205,BOOK XII.,wall the din arose.
7206,BOOK XII.,
7207,BOOK XII.,"Yet never would the Trojans, then, and renowned Hector have broken the"
7208,BOOK XII.,"gates of the wall, and the long bar, if Zeus the Counsellor had not"
7209,BOOK XII.,"roused his son Sarpedon against the Argives, like a lion against the"
7210,BOOK XII.,"kine of crooked horn. Straightway he held forth his fair round shield,"
7211,BOOK XII.,"of hammered bronze, that the bronze-smith had hammered out, and within"
7212,BOOK XII.,"had stitched many bulls’ hides with rivets of gold, all round the"
7213,BOOK XII.,"circle, this held he forth, and shook two spears; and sped on his way,"
7214,BOOK XII.,"like a mountain-nurtured lion, that long lacketh meat, and his brave"
7215,BOOK XII.,"spirit urgeth him to make assail on the sheep, and come even against a"
7216,BOOK XII.,"well-builded homestead. Nay, even if he find herdsmen thereby, guarding"
7217,BOOK XII.,"the sheep with hounds and spears, yet hath he no mind to be driven"
7218,BOOK XII.,"without an effort from the steading, but he either leapeth on a sheep,"
7219,BOOK XII.,"and seizeth it, or himself is smitten in the foremost place with a dart"
7220,BOOK XII.,from a strong hand. So did his heart then urge on the godlike Sarpedon
7221,BOOK XII.,"to rush against the wall, and break through the battlements. And"
7222,BOOK XII.,"instantly he spake to Glaukos, son of Hippolochos: “Glaukos, wherefore"
7223,BOOK XII.,"have we twain the chiefest honour,—seats of honour, and messes, and"
7224,BOOK XII.,"full cups in Lykia, and all men look on us as gods? And wherefore hold"
7225,BOOK XII.,"we a great demesne by the banks of Xanthos, a fair demesne of"
7226,BOOK XII.,"orchard-land, and wheat-bearing tilth? Therefore now it behoveth us to"
7227,BOOK XII.,"take our stand in the first rank of the Lykians, and encounter fiery"
7228,BOOK XII.,"battle, that certain of the well-corsleted Lykians may say, ‘Verily our"
7229,BOOK XII.,"kings that rule Lykia be no inglorious men, they that eat fat sheep,"
7230,BOOK XII.,"and drink the choice wine honey-sweet: nay, but they are also of"
7231,BOOK XII.,"excellent might, for they war in the foremost ranks of the Lykians.’"
7232,BOOK XII.,"Ah, friend, if once escaped from this battle we were for ever to be"
7233,BOOK XII.,"ageless and immortal, neither would I fight myself in the foremost"
7234,BOOK XII.,"ranks, nor would I send thee into the war that giveth men renown, but"
7235,BOOK XII.,"now—for assuredly ten thousand fates of death do every way beset us,"
7236,BOOK XII.,"and these no mortal may escape nor avoid—now let us go forward, whether"
7237,BOOK XII.,"we shall give glory to other men, or others to us.”"
7238,BOOK XII.,
7239,BOOK XII.,"So spake he, and Glaukos turned not apart, nor disobeyed him, and they"
7240,BOOK XII.,"twain went straight forward, leading the great host of the Lykians."
7241,BOOK XII.,
7242,BOOK XII.,"Then Menestheus son of Peteos shuddered when he beheld them, for"
7243,BOOK XII.,"against his tower they went, bringing with them ruin; and he looked"
7244,BOOK XII.,along the tower of the Achaians if perchance he might see any of the
7245,BOOK XII.,"leaders, that would ward off destruction from his comrades, and he"
7246,BOOK XII.,"beheld the two Aiantes, insatiate of war, standing there, and Teukros"
7247,BOOK XII.,"hard by, newly come from his hut; but he could not cry to be heard of"
7248,BOOK XII.,"them, so great was the din, and the noise went up unto heaven of"
7249,BOOK XII.,"smitten shields and helms with horse-hair crests, and of the gates, for"
7250,BOOK XII.,"they had all been shut, and the Trojans stood beside them, and strove"
7251,BOOK XII.,"by force to break them, and enter in. Swiftly then to Aias he sent the"
7252,BOOK XII.,"herald Thoötes: “Go, noble Thoötes, and run, and call Aias: or rather"
7253,BOOK XII.,"the twain, for that will be far the best of all, since quickly here"
7254,BOOK XII.,will there be wrought utter ruin. For hereby press the leaders of the
7255,BOOK XII.,"Lykians, who of old are fierce in strong battle. But if beside them too"
7256,BOOK XII.,"war and toil arise, yet at least let the strong Telamonian Aias come"
7257,BOOK XII.,"alone, and let Teukros the skilled bowman follow with him.”"
7258,BOOK XII.,
7259,BOOK XII.,"So spake he, and the herald listened and disobeyed him not, but started"
7260,BOOK XII.,"and ran by the wall of the mail-clad Achaians, and came, and stood by"
7261,BOOK XII.,"the Aiantes, and straightway spake: “Ye twain Aiantes, leaders of the"
7262,BOOK XII.,"mail-clad Achaians, the dear son of Peteos, fosterling of Zeus, biddeth"
7263,BOOK XII.,"you go thither, that, if it be but for a little while, ye may take your"
7264,BOOK XII.,"part in battle: both of you he more desireth, for that will be far the"
7265,BOOK XII.,"best of all, since quickly there will there be wrought utter ruin. For"
7266,BOOK XII.,"thereby press the leaders of the Lykians, who of old are fierce in"
7267,BOOK XII.,"strong battle. But if beside you too war and toil arise, yet at least"
7268,BOOK XII.,"let the strong Telamonian Aias come alone, and let Teukros the skilled"
7269,BOOK XII.,bowman follow with him.”
7270,BOOK XII.,
7271,BOOK XII.,"So spake he, nor did the strong Telamonian Aias disobey, but instantly"
7272,BOOK XII.,"spake winged words to the son of Oileus: “Aias, do ye twain stand here,"
7273,BOOK XII.,"thyself and strong Lykomedes, and urge the Danaans to war with all"
7274,BOOK XII.,"their might; but I go thither, to take my part in battle, and quickly"
7275,BOOK XII.,"will I come again, when I have well aided them.”"
7276,BOOK XII.,
7277,BOOK XII.,"So spake Telamonian Aias and departed, and Teukros went with him, his"
7278,BOOK XII.,"brother by the same father, and with them Pandion bare the bended bow"
7279,BOOK XII.,of Teukros.
7280,BOOK XII.,
7281,BOOK XII.,"Now when they came to the tower of great-hearted Menestheus, passing"
7282,BOOK XII.,"within the wall,—and to men sore pressed they came,—the foe were"
7283,BOOK XII.,"climbing upon the battlements, like a dark whirlwind, even the strong"
7284,BOOK XII.,leaders and counsellors of the Lykians; and they hurled together into
7285,BOOK XII.,the war and the battle-cry arose. Now first did Aias Telamon’s son slay
7286,BOOK XII.,"a man, Epikles great of heart, the comrade of Sarpedon. With a jagged"
7287,BOOK XII.,"stone he smote him, a great stone that lay uppermost within the wall,"
7288,BOOK XII.,"by the battlements. Not lightly could a man hold it in both hands,"
7289,BOOK XII.,"however strong in his youth, of such mortals as now are, but Aias"
7290,BOOK XII.,"lifted it, and cast it from above, and shattered the helm of fourfold"
7291,BOOK XII.,"crest, and broke the bones of the head, and he fell like a diver from"
7292,BOOK XII.,"the lofty tower, and his life left his bones. And Teukros smote"
7293,BOOK XII.,"Glaukos, the strong son of Hippolochos, as he came on, with an arrow"
7294,BOOK XII.,"from the lofty wall; even where he saw his shoulder bare he smote him,"
7295,BOOK XII.,and made him cease from delight in battle. Back from the wall he leapt
7296,BOOK XII.,"secretly, lest any of the Achaians should see him smitten, and speak"
7297,BOOK XII.,"boastfully. But sorrow came on Sarpedon when Glaukos departed, so soon"
7298,BOOK XII.,"as he was aware thereof, but he forgot not the joy of battle. He aimed"
7299,BOOK XII.,"at Alkmaon, son of Thestor, with the spear, and smote him, and drew out"
7300,BOOK XII.,"the spear. And Alkmaon following the spear fell prone, and his"
7301,BOOK XII.,bronze-dight arms rang round him. Then Sarpedon seized with strong
7302,BOOK XII.,"hands the battlement, and dragged, and it all gave way together, while"
7303,BOOK XII.,"above the wall was stripped bare, and made a path for many."
7304,BOOK XII.,
7305,BOOK XII.,Then Aias and Teukros did encounter him: Teukros smote him with an
7306,BOOK XII.,"arrow, on the bright baldric of his covering shield, about the breast,"
7307,BOOK XII.,"but Zeus warded off the Fates from his son, that he should not be"
7308,BOOK XII.,overcome beside the ships’ sterns. Then Aias leaped on and smote his
7309,BOOK XII.,"shield, nor did the spear pass clean through, yet shook he Sarpedon in"
7310,BOOK XII.,"his eagerness. He gave ground a little way from the battlement, yet"
7311,BOOK XII.,"retreated not wholly, since his heart hoped to win renown. Then he"
7312,BOOK XII.,"turned and cried to the godlike Lykians: “O Lykians, wherefore thus are"
7313,BOOK XII.,"ye slack in impetuous valour. Hard it is for me, stalwart as I am,"
7314,BOOK XII.,"alone to break through, and make a path to the ships, nay, follow hard"
7315,BOOK XII.,"after me, for the more men, the better work.”"
7316,BOOK XII.,
7317,BOOK XII.,"So spake he, and they, dreading the rebuke of their king, pressed on"
7318,BOOK XII.,the harder around the counsellor and king. And the Argives on the other
7319,BOOK XII.,"side made strong their battalions within the wall, and mighty toil"
7320,BOOK XII.,began for them. For neither could the strong Lykians burst through the
7321,BOOK XII.,"wall of the Danaans, and make a way to the ships, nor could the warlike"
7322,BOOK XII.,"Danaans drive back the Lykians from the wall, when once they had drawn"
7323,BOOK XII.,"near thereto. But as two men contend about the marches of their land,"
7324,BOOK XII.,"with measuring rods in their hands, in a common field, when in narrow"
7325,BOOK XII.,"space they strive for equal shares, even so the battlements divided"
7326,BOOK XII.,"them, and over those they smote the round shields of ox hide about the"
7327,BOOK XII.,"breasts of either side, and the fluttering bucklers. And many were"
7328,BOOK XII.,"wounded in the flesh with the ruthless bronze, whensoever the back of"
7329,BOOK XII.,"any of the warriors was laid bare as he turned, ay, and many clean"
7330,BOOK XII.,"through the very shield. Yea, everywhere the towers and battlements"
7331,BOOK XII.,"swam with the blood of men shed on either side, by Trojans and"
7332,BOOK XII.,"Achaians. But even so they could not put the Argives to rout, but they"
7333,BOOK XII.,"held their ground, as an honest woman that laboureth with her hands"
7334,BOOK XII.,"holds the balance, and raises the weight and the wool together,"
7335,BOOK XII.,"balancing them, that she may win scant wages for her children; so"
7336,BOOK XII.,"evenly was strained their war and battle, till the moment when Zeus"
7337,BOOK XII.,"gave the greater renown to Hector, son of Priam, who was the first to"
7338,BOOK XII.,leap within the wall of the Achaians. In a piercing voice he cried
7339,BOOK XII.,"aloud to the Trojans: “Rise, ye horse-taming Trojans, break the wall of"
7340,BOOK XII.,"the Argives, and cast among the ships fierce blazing fire.”"
7341,BOOK XII.,
7342,BOOK XII.,"So spake he, spurring them on, and they all heard him with their ears,"
7343,BOOK XII.,"and in one mass rushed straight against the wall, and with sharp spears"
7344,BOOK XII.,in their hands climbed upon the machicolations of the towers. And
7345,BOOK XII.,"Hector seized and carried a stone that lay in front of the gates, thick"
7346,BOOK XII.,"in the hinder part, but sharp at point: a stone that not the two best"
7347,BOOK XII.,"men of the people, such as mortals now are, could lightly lift from the"
7348,BOOK XII.,"ground on to a wain, but easily he wielded it alone, for the son of"
7349,BOOK XII.,crooked-counselling Kronos made it light for him. And as when a
7350,BOOK XII.,"shepherd lightly beareth the fleece of a ram, taking it in one hand,"
7351,BOOK XII.,"and little doth it burden him, so Hector lifted the stone, and bare it"
7352,BOOK XII.,straight against the doors that closely guarded the stubborn-set
7353,BOOK XII.,"portals, double gates and tall, and two cross bars held them within,"
7354,BOOK XII.,"and one bolt fastened them. And he came, and stood hard by, and firmly"
7355,BOOK XII.,"planted himself, and smote them in the midst, setting his legs well"
7356,BOOK XII.,"apart, that his cast might lack no strength. And he brake both the"
7357,BOOK XII.,"hinges, and the stone fell within by reason of its weight, and the"
7358,BOOK XII.,"gates rang loud around, and the bars held not, and the doors burst this"
7359,BOOK XII.,way and that beneath the rush of the stone. Then glorious Hector leaped
7360,BOOK XII.,"in, with face like the sudden night, shining in wondrous mail that was"
7361,BOOK XII.,"clad about his body, and with two spears in his hands. No man that met"
7362,BOOK XII.,him could have held him back when once he leaped within the gates: none
7363,BOOK XII.,"but the gods, and his eyes shone with fire. Turning towards the throng"
7364,BOOK XII.,"he cried to the Trojans to overleap the wall, and they obeyed his"
7365,BOOK XII.,"summons, and speedily some overleaped the wall, and some poured into"
7366,BOOK XII.,"the fair-wrought gateways, and the Danaans fled in fear among the"
7367,BOOK XII.,"hollow ships, and a ceaseless clamour arose."

7378,BOOK XIII.,
7379,BOOK XIII.,"Now Zeus, after that he had brought the Trojans and Hector to the"
7380,BOOK XIII.,"ships, left them to their toil and endless labour there, but otherwhere"
7381,BOOK XIII.,"again he turned his shining eyes, and looked upon the land of the"
7382,BOOK XIII.,"Thracian horsebreeders, and the Mysians, fierce fighters hand to hand,"
7383,BOOK XIII.,"and the proud Hippemolgoi that drink mare’s milk, and the Abioi, the"
7384,BOOK XIII.,most righteous of men. To Troy no more at all he turned his shining
7385,BOOK XIII.,"eyes, for he deemed in his heart that not one of the Immortals would"
7386,BOOK XIII.,"draw near, to help either Trojans or Danaans."
7387,BOOK XIII.,
7388,BOOK XIII.,"But the mighty Earthshaker held no blind watch, who sat and marvelled"
7389,BOOK XIII.,"on the war and strife, high on the topmost crest of wooded Samothrace,"
7390,BOOK XIII.,for thence all Ida was plain to see; and plain to see were the city of
7391,BOOK XIII.,"Priam, and the ships of the Achaians. Thither did he go from the sea"
7392,BOOK XIII.,"and sate him down, and he had pity on the Achaians, that they were"
7393,BOOK XIII.,"subdued to the Trojans, and strong was his anger against Zeus."
7394,BOOK XIII.,
7395,BOOK XIII.,"Then forthwith he went down from the rugged hill, faring with swift"
7396,BOOK XIII.,"steps, and the high hills trembled, and the woodland, beneath the"
7397,BOOK XIII.,"immortal footsteps of Poseidon as he moved. Three strides he made, and"
7398,BOOK XIII.,"with the fourth he reached his goal, even Aigae, and there was his"
7399,BOOK XIII.,"famous palace in the deeps of the mere, his glistering golden mansions"
7400,BOOK XIII.,"builded, imperishable for ever. Thither went he, and let harness to the"
7401,BOOK XIII.,"car his bronze-hooved horses, swift of flight, clothed with their"
7402,BOOK XIII.,"golden manes. He girt his own golden array about his body, and seized"
7403,BOOK XIII.,"the well-wrought lash of gold, and mounted his chariot, and forth he"
7404,BOOK XIII.,"drove across the waves. And the sea beasts frolicked beneath him, on"
7405,BOOK XIII.,"all sides out of the deeps, for well they knew their lord, and with"
7406,BOOK XIII.,"gladness the sea stood asunder, and swiftly they sped, and the axle of"
7407,BOOK XIII.,"bronze was not wetted beneath, and the bounding steeds bare him on to"
7408,BOOK XIII.,the ships of the Achaians.
7409,BOOK XIII.,
7410,BOOK XIII.,"Now there is a spacious cave in the depths of the deep mere, between"
7411,BOOK XIII.,"Tenedos and rugged Imbros; there did Poseidon, the Shaker of the earth,"
7412,BOOK XIII.,"stay his horses, and loosed them out of the chariot, and cast before"
7413,BOOK XIII.,"them ambrosial food to graze withal, and golden tethers he bound about"
7414,BOOK XIII.,"their hooves, tethers neither to be broken nor loosed, that there the"
7415,BOOK XIII.,horses might continually await their lord’s return. And he went to the
7416,BOOK XIII.,host of the Achaians.
7417,BOOK XIII.,
7418,BOOK XIII.,"Now the Trojans like flame or storm-wind were following in close array,"
7419,BOOK XIII.,"with fierce intent, after Hector, son of Priam. With shouts and cries"
7420,BOOK XIII.,"they came, and thought to take the ships of the Achaians, and to slay"
7421,BOOK XIII.,"thereby all the bravest of the host. But Poseidon, that girdleth the"
7422,BOOK XIII.,"world, the Shaker of the earth, was urging on the Argives, and forth he"
7423,BOOK XIII.,"came from the deep salt sea, in form and untiring voice like unto"
7424,BOOK XIII.,"Kalchas. First he spake to the two Aiantes, that themselves were eager"
7425,BOOK XIII.,"for battle: “Ye Aiantes twain, ye shall save the people of the"
7426,BOOK XIII.,"Achaians, if ye are mindful of your might, and reckless of chill fear."
7427,BOOK XIII.,For verily I do not otherwhere dread the invincible hands of the
7428,BOOK XIII.,"Trojans, that have climbed the great wall in their multitude, nay, the"
7429,BOOK XIII.,well-greaved Achaians will hold them all at bay; but hereby verily do I
7430,BOOK XIII.,"greatly dread lest some evil befall us, even here where that furious"
7431,BOOK XIII.,"one is leading like a flame of fire, Hector, who boasts him to be son"
7432,BOOK XIII.,"of mighty Zeus. Nay, but here may some god put it into the hearts of"
7433,BOOK XIII.,"you twain, to stand sturdily yourselves, and urge others to do the"
7434,BOOK XIII.,"like; thereby might ye drive him from the fleet-faring ships, despite"
7435,BOOK XIII.,"his eagerness, yea, even if the Olympian himself is rousing him to"
7436,BOOK XIII.,war.”
7437,BOOK XIII.,
7438,BOOK XIII.,"Therewith the Shaker of the world, the girdler of the earth, struck the"
7439,BOOK XIII.,"twain with his staff, and filled them with strong courage, and their"
7440,BOOK XIII.,"limbs he made light, and their feet, and their hands withal. Then, even"
7441,BOOK XIII.,"as a swift-winged hawk speeds forth to fly, poised high above a tall"
7442,BOOK XIII.,"sheer rock, and swoops to chase some other bird across the plain, even"
7443,BOOK XIII.,"so Poseidon sped from them, the Shaker of the world. And of the twain"
7444,BOOK XIII.,"Oileus’ son, the swift-footed Aias, was the first to know the god, and"
7445,BOOK XIII.,"instantly he spake to Aias, son of Telamon: “Aias, since it is one of"
7446,BOOK XIII.,"the gods who hold Olympus, that in the semblance of a seer commands us"
7447,BOOK XIII.,"now to fight beside the ships—not Kalchas is he, the prophet and"
7448,BOOK XIII.,"soothsayer, for easily I knew the tokens of his feet and knees as he"
7449,BOOK XIII.,"turned away, and the gods are easy to discern—lo, then mine own heart"
7450,BOOK XIII.,"within my breast is more eagerly set on war and battle, and my feet"
7451,BOOK XIII.,beneath and my hands above are lusting for the fight.”
7452,BOOK XIII.,
7453,BOOK XIII.,"Then Aias, son of Telamon, answered him saying: “Even so, too, my hands"
7454,BOOK XIII.,"invincible now rage about the spear-shaft, and wrath has risen within"
7455,BOOK XIII.,"me, and both my feet are swift beneath me; yea, I am keen to meet, even"
7456,BOOK XIII.,"in single fight, the ceaseless rage of Hector son of Priam.”"
7457,BOOK XIII.,
7458,BOOK XIII.,"So they spake to each other, rejoicing in the delight of battle, which"
7459,BOOK XIII.,the god put in their heart. Then the girdler of the earth stirred up
7460,BOOK XIII.,the Achaians that were in the rear and were renewing their strength
7461,BOOK XIII.,beside the swift ships. Their limbs were loosened by their grievous
7462,BOOK XIII.,"toil, yea, and their souls filled with sorrow at the sight of the"
7463,BOOK XIII.,"Trojans, that had climbed over the great wall in their multitude. And"
7464,BOOK XIII.,"they looked on them, and shed tears beneath their brows, thinking that"
7465,BOOK XIII.,never would they escape destruction. But the Shaker of the earth right
7466,BOOK XIII.,"easily came among them, and urged on the strong battalions of warriors."
7467,BOOK XIII.,"Teukros first he came and summoned, and Leïtos, and the hero Peneleos,"
7468,BOOK XIII.,"and Thoas, and Deïpyros, and Meriones, and Antilochos, lords of the"
7469,BOOK XIII.,"war-cry, all these he spurred on with winged words: “Shame on you,"
7470,BOOK XIII.,"Argives, shame, ye striplings, in your battle had I trusted for the"
7471,BOOK XIII.,"salvation of our ships. But if you are to withdraw from grievous war,"
7472,BOOK XIII.,now indeed the day doth shine that shall see us conquered by the
7473,BOOK XIII.,"Trojans. Out on it, for verily a great marvel is this that mine eyes"
7474,BOOK XIII.,"behold, a terrible thing that methought should never come to pass, the"
7475,BOOK XIII.,Trojans advancing against our ships! Of yore they were like fleeting
7476,BOOK XIII.,"hinds, that in the wild wood are the prey of jackals, and pards, and"
7477,BOOK XIII.,"wolves, and wander helpless, strengthless, empty of the joy of battle."
7478,BOOK XIII.,Even so the Trojans of old cared never to wait and face the wrath and
7479,BOOK XIII.,"the hands of the Achaians, not for a moment. But now they are fighting"
7480,BOOK XIII.,"far from the town, by the hollow ships, all through the baseness of our"
7481,BOOK XIII.,"leader and the remissness of the people, who, being at strife with the"
7482,BOOK XIII.,"chief, have no heart to defend the swift-faring ships, nay, thereby"
7483,BOOK XIII.,"they are slain. But if indeed and in truth the hero Agamemnon, the"
7484,BOOK XIII.,"wide-ruling son of Atreus, is the very cause of all, for that he did"
7485,BOOK XIII.,"dishonour the swift-footed son of Peleus, not even so may we refrain in"
7486,BOOK XIII.,"any wise from war. Nay, let us right our fault with speed, for easily"
7487,BOOK XIII.,righted are the hearts of the brave. No longer do ye well to refrain
7488,BOOK XIII.,"from impetuous might, all ye that are the best men of the host. I"
7489,BOOK XIII.,"myself would not quarrel with one that, being a weakling, abstained"
7490,BOOK XIII.,"from war, but with you I am heartily wroth. Ah, friends, soon shall ye"
7491,BOOK XIII.,"make the mischief more through this remissness,—but let each man"
7492,BOOK XIII.,"conceive shame in his heart, and indignation, for verily great is the"
7493,BOOK XIII.,"strife that hath arisen. Lo, the mighty Hector of the loud war-cry is"
7494,BOOK XIII.,"fighting at the ships, and the gates and the long bar he hath burst in"
7495,BOOK XIII.,sunder.”
7496,BOOK XIII.,
7497,BOOK XIII.,On this wise did the Earth-enfolder call to and spur on the Achaians.
7498,BOOK XIII.,"And straightway they made a stand around the two Aiantes, strong bands"
7499,BOOK XIII.,"that Ares himself could not enter and make light of, nor Athene that"
7500,BOOK XIII.,"marshals the host. Yea, they were the chosen best that abode the"
7501,BOOK XIII.,"Trojans and goodly Hector, and spear on spear made close-set fence, and"
7502,BOOK XIII.,"shield on serried shield, buckler pressed on buckler, and helm on helm,"
7503,BOOK XIII.,and man on man. The horse-hair crests on the bright helmet-ridges
7504,BOOK XIII.,"touched each other as they nodded, so close they stood each by other,"
7505,BOOK XIII.,and spears brandished in bold hands were interlaced; and their hearts
7506,BOOK XIII.,were steadfast and lusted for battle.
7507,BOOK XIII.,
7508,BOOK XIII.,"Then the Trojans drave forward in close array, and Hector led them,"
7509,BOOK XIII.,"pressing straight onwards, like a rolling rock from a cliff, that the"
7510,BOOK XIII.,"winter-swollen water thrusteth from the crest of a hill, having broken"
7511,BOOK XIII.,the foundations of the stubborn rock with its wondrous flood; leaping
7512,BOOK XIII.,"aloft it flies, and the wood echoes under it, and unstayed it runs its"
7513,BOOK XIII.,"course, till it reaches the level plain, and then it rolls no more for"
7514,BOOK XIII.,"all its eagerness,—even so Hector for a while threatened lightly to win"
7515,BOOK XIII.,"to the sea through the huts and the ships of the Achaians, slaying as"
7516,BOOK XIII.,"he came, but when he encountered the serried battalions, he was stayed"
7517,BOOK XIII.,"when he drew near against them. But they of the other part, the sons of"
7518,BOOK XIII.,"the Achaians, thrust with their swords and double-pointed spears, and"
7519,BOOK XIII.,"drave him forth from them, that he gave ground and reeled backward."
7520,BOOK XIII.,"Then he cried with a piercing voice, calling on the Trojans: “Trojans,"
7521,BOOK XIII.,"and Lykians, and close-fighting Dardanians, hold your ground, for the"
7522,BOOK XIII.,"Achaians will not long ward me off, nay, though they have arrayed"
7523,BOOK XIII.,"themselves in fashion like a tower. Rather, methinks, they will flee"
7524,BOOK XIII.,"back before the spear, if verily the chief of gods has set me on, the"
7525,BOOK XIII.,loud-thundering lord of Hera.”
7526,BOOK XIII.,
7527,BOOK XIII.,Therewith he spurred on the heart and spirit of each man; and
7528,BOOK XIII.,"Deïphobos, the son of Priam, strode among them with high thoughts, and"
7529,BOOK XIII.,"held in front of him the circle of his shield, and lightly he stepped"
7530,BOOK XIII.,"with his feet, advancing beneath the cover of his shield. Then Meriones"
7531,BOOK XIII.,"aimed at him with a shining spear, and struck, and missed not, but"
7532,BOOK XIII.,"smote the circle of the bulls’-hide shield, yet no whit did he pierce"
7533,BOOK XIII.,"it; nay, well ere that might be, the long spear-shaft snapped in the"
7534,BOOK XIII.,"socket. Now Deiphobos was holding off from him the bulls’-hide shield,"
7535,BOOK XIII.,"and his heart feared the lance of wise Meriones, but that hero shrunk"
7536,BOOK XIII.,"back among the throng of his comrades, greatly in wrath both for the"
7537,BOOK XIII.,"loss of victory, and of his spear, that he had shivered. So he set"
7538,BOOK XIII.,"forth to go to the huts and the ships of the Achaians, to bring a long"
7539,BOOK XIII.,"spear, that he had left in his hut."
7540,BOOK XIII.,
7541,BOOK XIII.,"Meanwhile the others were fighting on, and there arose an"
7542,BOOK XIII.,"inextinguishable cry. First Teukros, son of Telamon, slew a man, the"
7543,BOOK XIII.,"spearman Imbrios, the son of Mentor rich in horses. In Pedaion he"
7544,BOOK XIII.,"dwelt, before the coming of the sons of the Achaians, and he had for"
7545,BOOK XIII.,"wife a daughter of Priam, born out of wedlock, Medesikaste; but when"
7546,BOOK XIII.,"the curved ships of the Danaans came, he returned again to Ilios, and"
7547,BOOK XIII.,"was pre-eminent among the Trojans, and dwelt with Priam, who honoured"
7548,BOOK XIII.,him like his own children. Him the son of Telemon pierced below the ear
7549,BOOK XIII.,"with his long lance, and plucked back the spear. Then he fell like an"
7550,BOOK XIII.,ash that on the crest of a far-seen hill is smitten with the axe of
7551,BOOK XIII.,"bronze, and brings its delicate foliage to the ground; even so he fell,"
7552,BOOK XIII.,and round him rang his armour bedight with bronze. Then Teukros rushed
7553,BOOK XIII.,"forth, most eager to strip his armour, and Hector cast at him as he"
7554,BOOK XIII.,"came with his shining spear. But Teukros, steadily regarding him,"
7555,BOOK XIII.,"avoided by a little the spear of bronze; so Hector struck Amphimachos,"
7556,BOOK XIII.,"son of Kteatos, son of Aktor, in the breast with the spear, as he was"
7557,BOOK XIII.,"returning to the battle. With a crash he fell, and his armour rang upon"
7558,BOOK XIII.,him.
7559,BOOK XIII.,
7560,BOOK XIII.,Then Hector sped forth to tear from the head of great-hearted
7561,BOOK XIII.,"Amphimachos the helmet closely fitted to his temples, but Aias aimed at"
7562,BOOK XIII.,"Hector as he came, with a shining spear, yet in no wise touched his"
7563,BOOK XIII.,"body, for he was all clad in dread armour of bronze; but he smote the"
7564,BOOK XIII.,"boss of his shield, and drave him back by main force, and he gave place"
7565,BOOK XIII.,"from behind the two dead men, and the Achaians drew them out of the"
7566,BOOK XIII.,"battle. So Stichios and goodly Menestheus, leaders of the Athenians,"
7567,BOOK XIII.,"conveyed Amphimachos back among the host of the Achaians, but Imbrios"
7568,BOOK XIII.,"the two Aiantes carried, with hearts full of impetuous might. And as"
7569,BOOK XIII.,"when two lions have snatched away a goat from sharp-toothed hounds, and"
7570,BOOK XIII.,"carry it through the deep thicket, holding the body on high above the"
7571,BOOK XIII.,"ground in their jaws, so the two warrior Aiantes held Imbrios aloft and"
7572,BOOK XIII.,spoiled his arms. Then the son of Oileus cut his head from his delicate
7573,BOOK XIII.,"neck, in wrath for the sake of Amphimachos, and sent it rolling like a"
7574,BOOK XIII.,"ball through the throng, and it dropped in the dust before the feet of"
7575,BOOK XIII.,Hector.
7576,BOOK XIII.,
7577,BOOK XIII.,"Then verily was Poseidon wroth at heart, when his son’s son fell in the"
7578,BOOK XIII.,terrible fray.* So he set forth to go by the huts and the ships of the
7579,BOOK XIII.,"Achaians, to spur on the Danaans, and sorrows he was contriving for the"
7580,BOOK XIII.,"Trojans. Then Idomeneus, spearman renowned, met him on his way from his"
7581,BOOK XIII.,"comrade that had but newly returned to him out of the battle, wounded"
7582,BOOK XIII.,"on the knee with the sharp bronze. Him his comrades carried forth, and"
7583,BOOK XIII.,"Idomeneus gave charge to the leeches, and so went on to his hut, for he"
7584,BOOK XIII.,still was eager to face the war. Then the mighty Shaker of the earth
7585,BOOK XIII.,"addressed him, in the voice of Thoas, son of Andraimon, that ruled over"
7586,BOOK XIII.,"the Aitolians in all Pleuron, and mountainous Kalydon, and was honoured"
7587,BOOK XIII.,"like a god by the people: “Idomeneus, thou counsellor of the Cretans,"
7588,BOOK XIII.,"say, whither have thy threats fared, wherewith the sons of the Achaians"
7589,BOOK XIII.,threatened the Trojans?”
7590,BOOK XIII.,
7591,BOOK XIII.,"* Kteatos, father of Amphimachos, was Poseidon’s son."
7592,BOOK XIII.,
7593,BOOK XIII.,
7594,BOOK XIII.,"Then Idomeneus, leader of the Cretans, answered him again: “O Thaos,"
7595,BOOK XIII.,"now is there no man to blame, that I wot of, for we all are skilled in"
7596,BOOK XIII.,"war. Neither is there any man that spiritless fear holds aloof, nor any"
7597,BOOK XIII.,"that gives place to cowardice, and shuns the cruel war, nay, but even"
7598,BOOK XIII.,"thus, methinks, must it have seemed good to almighty Kronion, even that"
7599,BOOK XIII.,"the Achaians should perish nameless here, far away from Argos. But"
7600,BOOK XIII.,"Thoas, seeing that of old thou wert staunch, and dost spur on some"
7601,BOOK XIII.,"other man, wheresoever thou mayst see any give ground, therefore"
7602,BOOK XIII.,"slacken not now, but call aloud to every warrior.”"
7603,BOOK XIII.,
7604,BOOK XIII.,"Then Poseidon, the Shaker of the earth, answered him again: “Idomeneus,"
7605,BOOK XIII.,"never may that man go forth out of Troy-land, but here may he be the"
7606,BOOK XIII.,"sport of dogs, who this day wilfully is slack in battle. Nay, come,"
7607,BOOK XIII.,"take thy weapons and away: herein we must play the man together, if any"
7608,BOOK XIII.,"avail there may be, though we are no more than two. Ay, and very"
7609,BOOK XIII.,"cowards get courage from company, but we twain know well how to battle"
7610,BOOK XIII.,even with the brave.”
7611,BOOK XIII.,
7612,BOOK XIII.,"Therewith the god went back again into the strife of men, but"
7613,BOOK XIII.,"Idomeneus, so soon as he came to his well-builded hut, did on his fair"
7614,BOOK XIII.,"armour about his body, and grasped two spears, and set forth like the"
7615,BOOK XIII.,lightning that Kronion seizes in his hand and brandishes from radiant
7616,BOOK XIII.,"Olympus, showing forth a sign to mortal men, and far seen are the"
7617,BOOK XIII.,flames thereof. Even so shone the bronze about the breast of Idomeneus
7618,BOOK XIII.,"as he ran, and Meriones, his good squire, met him, while he was still"
7619,BOOK XIII.,"near his hut,—he was going to bring his spear of bronze,—and mighty"
7620,BOOK XIII.,"Idomeneus spake to him: “Meriones son of Molos, fleet of foot, dearest"
7621,BOOK XIII.,"of my company, wherefore hast thou come hither and left the war and"
7622,BOOK XIII.,"strife? Art thou wounded at all, and vexed by a dart’s point, or dost"
7623,BOOK XIII.,thou come with a message for me concerning aught? Verily I myself have
7624,BOOK XIII.,"no desire to sit in the huts, but to fight.”"
7625,BOOK XIII.,
7626,BOOK XIII.,"Then wise Meriones answered him again, saying: “[Idomeneus, thou"
7627,BOOK XIII.,"counsellor of the mail-clad Cretans,] I have come to fetch a spear, if"
7628,BOOK XIII.,"perchance thou hast one left in the huts, for that which before I"
7629,BOOK XIII.,carried I have shivered in casting at the shield of proud Deiphobos.”
7630,BOOK XIII.,
7631,BOOK XIII.,"Then Idomeneus, leader of the Cretans, answered him again: “Spears, if"
7632,BOOK XIII.,"thou wilt, thou shalt find, one, ay, and twenty, standing in the hut,"
7633,BOOK XIII.,"against the shining side walls, spears of the Trojans whereof I have"
7634,BOOK XIII.,"spoiled their slain. Yea, it is not my mood to stand and fight with"
7635,BOOK XIII.,"foemen from afar, wherefore I have spears, and bossy shields, and"
7636,BOOK XIII.,"helms, and corslets of splendid sheen.”"
7637,BOOK XIII.,
7638,BOOK XIII.,"Then wise Meriones answered him again: “Yea, and in mine own hut and my"
7639,BOOK XIII.,"black ship are many spoils of the Trojans, but not ready to my hand."
7640,BOOK XIII.,"Nay, for methinks that neither am I forgetful of valour; but stand"
7641,BOOK XIII.,"forth among the foremost to face the glorious war, whensoever ariseth"
7642,BOOK XIII.,"the strife of battle. Any other, methinks, of the mail-clad Achaians"
7643,BOOK XIII.,"should sooner forget my prowess, but thou art he that knoweth it.”"
7644,BOOK XIII.,
7645,BOOK XIII.,"Then Idomeneus, leader of the Cretans, answered him again: “I know what"
7646,BOOK XIII.,"a man of valour thou art, wherefore shouldst thou tell me thereof? Nay,"
7647,BOOK XIII.,if now beside the ships all the best of us were being chosen for an
7648,BOOK XIII.,"ambush—wherein the valour of men is best discerned; there the coward,"
7649,BOOK XIII.,and the brave man most plainly declare themselves: for the colour of
7650,BOOK XIII.,"the coward changes often, and his spirit cannot abide firm within him,"
7651,BOOK XIII.,"but now he kneels on one knee, now on the other, and rests on either"
7652,BOOK XIII.,"foot, and his heart beats noisily in his breast, as he thinks of doom,"
7653,BOOK XIII.,and his teeth chatter loudly. But the colour of the brave man does not
7654,BOOK XIII.,"change, nor is he greatly afraid, from the moment that he enters the"
7655,BOOK XIII.,"ambush of heroes, but his prayer is to mingle instantly in woful war."
7656,BOOK XIII.,"Were we being chosen for such an ambush, I say, not even then would any"
7657,BOOK XIII.,"man reckon lightly of thy courage and thy strength. Nay, and even if"
7658,BOOK XIII.,"thou wert stricken in battle from afar, or smitten in close fight, the"
7659,BOOK XIII.,"dart would not strike thee in the hinder part of the neck, nor in the"
7660,BOOK XIII.,"back, but would encounter thy breast or belly, as thou dost press on,"
7661,BOOK XIII.,"towards the gathering of the foremost fighters. But come, no more let"
7662,BOOK XIII.,"us talk thus, like children, loitering here, lest any man be vehemently"
7663,BOOK XIII.,"wroth, but go thou to the hut, and bring the strong spear.”"
7664,BOOK XIII.,
7665,BOOK XIII.,"Thus he spake, and Meriones, the peer of swift Ares, quickly bare the"
7666,BOOK XIII.,"spear of bronze from the hut, and went after Idomeneus, with high"
7667,BOOK XIII.,"thoughts of battle. And even as Ares, the bane of men, goes forth into"
7668,BOOK XIII.,"the war, and with him follows his dear son Panic, stark and fearless,"
7669,BOOK XIII.,"that terrifies even the hardy warrior; and these twain leave Thrace,"
7670,BOOK XIII.,"and harness them for fight with the Ephyri, or the great-hearted"
7671,BOOK XIII.,"Phlegyans, yet hearken not to both peoples, but give honour to one"
7672,BOOK XIII.,"only; like these gods did Meriones and Idomeneus, leaders of men, set"
7673,BOOK XIII.,"forth into the fight, harnessed in gleaming bronze. And Meriones spake"
7674,BOOK XIII.,"first to Idomeneus saying: “Child of Deukalion, whither art thou eager"
7675,BOOK XIII.,"to enter into the throng: on the right of all the host, or in the"
7676,BOOK XIII.,"centre, or on the left? Ay, and no other where, methinks, are the"
7677,BOOK XIII.,flowing-haired Achaians so like to fail in fight.”
7678,BOOK XIII.,
7679,BOOK XIII.,"Then Idomeneus, the leader of the Cretans, answered him again: “In the"
7680,BOOK XIII.,"centre of the ships there are others to bear the brunt, the two"
7681,BOOK XIII.,"Aiantes, and Teukros, the best bowman of the Achaians, ay, and a good"
7682,BOOK XIII.,"man in close fight; these will give Hector Priam’s son toil enough,"
7683,BOOK XIII.,"howsoever keen he be for battle; yea, though he be exceeding stalwart."
7684,BOOK XIII.,"Hard will he find it, with all his lust for war, to overcome their"
7685,BOOK XIII.,"strength and their hands invincible, and to fire the ships, unless"
7686,BOOK XIII.,Kronion himself send down on the swift ships a burning brand. But not
7687,BOOK XIII.,"to a man would he yield, the great Telamonian Aias, to a man that is"
7688,BOOK XIII.,"mortal and eateth Demeter’s grain, and may be cloven with the sword of"
7689,BOOK XIII.,"bronze, and with hurling of great stones. Nay, not even to Achilles the"
7690,BOOK XIII.,"breaker of the ranks of men would he give way, not in close fight; but"
7691,BOOK XIII.,for speed of foot none may in any wise strive with Achilles. But guide
7692,BOOK XIII.,"us twain, as thou sayest, to the left hand of the host, that speedily"
7693,BOOK XIII.,"we may learn whether we are to win glory from others, or other men from"
7694,BOOK XIII.,us.”
7695,BOOK XIII.,
7696,BOOK XIII.,"So he spake, and Meriones, the peer of swift Ares, led the way, till"
7697,BOOK XIII.,"they came to the host, in that place whither he bade him go."
7698,BOOK XIII.,
7699,BOOK XIII.,"And when the Trojans saw Idomeneus, strong as flame, and his squire"
7700,BOOK XIII.,"with him, and their glorious armour, they all shouted and made for him"
7701,BOOK XIII.,"through the press. Then their mellay began, by the sterns of the ships."
7702,BOOK XIII.,"And as the gusts speed on, when shrill winds blow, on a day when dust"
7703,BOOK XIII.,"lies thickest on the roads, and the winds raise together a great cloud"
7704,BOOK XIII.,"of dust, even so their battle clashed together, and all were fain of"
7705,BOOK XIII.,heart to slay each other in the press with the keen bronze. And the
7706,BOOK XIII.,"battle, the bane of men, bristled with the long spears, the piercing"
7707,BOOK XIII.,"spears they grasped, and the glitter of bronze from gleaming helmets"
7708,BOOK XIII.,"dazzled the eyes, and the sheen of new-burnished corslets, and shining"
7709,BOOK XIII.,"shields, as the men thronged all together. Right hardy of heart would"
7710,BOOK XIII.,he have been that joyed and sorrowed not at the sight of this labour of
7711,BOOK XIII.,battle.
7712,BOOK XIII.,
7713,BOOK XIII.,"Thus the two mighty sons of Kronos, with contending will, were"
7714,BOOK XIII.,contriving sorrow and anguish for the heroes. Zeus desired victory for
7715,BOOK XIII.,"the Trojans and Hector, giving glory to swift-footed Achilles; yet he"
7716,BOOK XIII.,"did not wish the Achaian host to perish utterly before Ilios, but only"
7717,BOOK XIII.,to give renown to Thetis and her strong-hearted son. But Poseidon went
7718,BOOK XIII.,"among the Argives and stirred them to war, stealing secretly forth from"
7719,BOOK XIII.,the grey salt sea: for he was sore vexed that they were overcome by the
7720,BOOK XIII.,"Trojans, and was greatly in wrath against Zeus. Verily both were of the"
7721,BOOK XIII.,"same lineage and the same place of birth, but Zeus was the elder and"
7722,BOOK XIII.,"the wiser. Therefore also Poseidon avoided to give open aid, but"
7723,BOOK XIII.,"secretly ever he spurred them on, throughout the host, in the likeness"
7724,BOOK XIII.,of a man. These twain had strained the ends of the cords of strong
7725,BOOK XIII.,"strife and equal war, and had stretched them over both Trojans and"
7726,BOOK XIII.,"Achaians, a knot that none might break nor undo, for the loosening of"
7727,BOOK XIII.,the knees of many.
7728,BOOK XIII.,
7729,BOOK XIII.,"Even then Idomeneus, though his hair was flecked with grey, called on"
7730,BOOK XIII.,"the Danaans, and leaping among the Trojans, roused their terror. For he"
7731,BOOK XIII.,"slew Othryoneus of Kabesos, a sojourner there, who but lately had"
7732,BOOK XIII.,"followed after the rumour of war, and asked in marriage the fairest of"
7733,BOOK XIII.,"the daughters of Priam, Kassandra, without gifts of wooing, but with"
7734,BOOK XIII.,"promise of mighty deed, namely that he would drive perforce out of"
7735,BOOK XIII.,Troy-land the sons of the Achaians. To him the old man Priam promised
7736,BOOK XIII.,"and appointed that he would give her, so he fought trusting in his"
7737,BOOK XIII.,"promises. And Idomeneus aimed at him with a bright spear, and cast and"
7738,BOOK XIII.,"smote him as he came proudly striding on, and the corslet of bronze"
7739,BOOK XIII.,"that he wore availed not, but the lance struck in the midst of his"
7740,BOOK XIII.,"belly. And he fell with a crash, and Idomeneus boasted over him, and"
7741,BOOK XIII.,"lifted up his voice, saying: “Othryoneus, verily I praise thee above"
7742,BOOK XIII.,"all mortal men, if indeed thou shalt accomplish all that thou hast"
7743,BOOK XIII.,"promised to Priam, son of Dardanos, that promised thee again his own"
7744,BOOK XIII.,"daughter. Yea, and we likewise would promise as much to thee, and"
7745,BOOK XIII.,"fulfil it, and would give thee the fairest daughter of the son of"
7746,BOOK XIII.,"Atreus, and bring her from Argos, and wed her to thee, if only thou"
7747,BOOK XIII.,"wilt aid us to take the fair-set citadel of Ilios. Nay, follow us that"
7748,BOOK XIII.,"we may make a covenant of marriage by the seafaring ships, for we are"
7749,BOOK XIII.,no hard exacters of gifts of wooing.”
7750,BOOK XIII.,
7751,BOOK XIII.,Therewith the hero Idomeneus dragged him by the foot across the fierce
7752,BOOK XIII.,"mellay. But Asios came to his aid, on foot before his horses that the"
7753,BOOK XIII.,charioteer guided so that still their breath touched the shoulders of
7754,BOOK XIII.,"Asios. And the desire of his heart was to cast at Idomeneus, who was"
7755,BOOK XIII.,"beforehand with him, and smote him with the spear in the throat, below"
7756,BOOK XIII.,"the chin, and drove the point straight through. And he fell as an oak"
7757,BOOK XIII.,"falls, or a poplar, or tall pine tree, that craftsmen have felled on"
7758,BOOK XIII.,"the hills with new whetted axes, to be a ship’s timber, even so he lay"
7759,BOOK XIII.,"stretched out before the horses and the chariot, groaning, and"
7760,BOOK XIII.,"clutching the bloody dust. And the charioteer was amazed, and kept not"
7761,BOOK XIII.,"his wits, as of old, and dared not turn his horses and avoid out of the"
7762,BOOK XIII.,"hands of foemen; and Antilochos the steadfast in war smote him, and"
7763,BOOK XIII.,pierced the middle of his body with a spear. Nothing availed the
7764,BOOK XIII.,"corslet of bronze he was wont to wear, but he planted the spear fast in"
7765,BOOK XIII.,the midst of his belly. Therewith he fell gasping from the well-wrought
7766,BOOK XIII.,"chariot, and Antilochos, the son of great-hearted Nestor, drave the"
7767,BOOK XIII.,"horses out from the Trojans, among the well-greaved Achaians. Then"
7768,BOOK XIII.,"Deiphobos, in sorrow for Asios, drew very nigh Idomeneus, and cast at"
7769,BOOK XIII.,"him with his shining spear. But Idomeneus steadily watching him,"
7770,BOOK XIII.,"avoided the spear of bronze, being hidden beneath the circle of his"
7771,BOOK XIII.,"shield, the shield covered about with ox-hide and gleaming bronze, that"
7772,BOOK XIII.,"he allows bore, fitted with two arm-rods: under this he crouched"
7773,BOOK XIII.,"together, and the spear of bronze flew over. And his shield rang"
7774,BOOK XIII.,"sharply, as the spear grazed thereon. Yet it flew not vainly from the"
7775,BOOK XIII.,"heavy hand of Deiphobos, but smote Hypsenor, son of Hippasos, the"
7776,BOOK XIII.,"shepherd of the hosts, in the liver, beneath the midriff, and instantly"
7777,BOOK XIII.,"unstrung his knees. And Deiphobos boasted over him terribly, crying"
7778,BOOK XIII.,"aloud: “Ah, verily, not unavenged lies Asios, nay, methinks, that even"
7779,BOOK XIII.,"on his road to Hades, strong Warden of the gate, he will rejoice at"
7780,BOOK XIII.,"heart, since, lo, I have sent him escort for the way!”"
7781,BOOK XIII.,
7782,BOOK XIII.,"So spake he, but grief came on the Argives by reason of his boast, and"
7783,BOOK XIII.,"stirred above all the soul of the wise-hearted Antilochos, yet, despite"
7784,BOOK XIII.,"his sorrow, he was not heedless of his dear comrade, but ran and stood"
7785,BOOK XIII.,"over him, and covered him with his buckler. Then two trusty companions,"
7786,BOOK XIII.,"Mekisteus, son of Echios, and goodly Alastor, stooped down and lifted"
7787,BOOK XIII.,"him, and with heavy groaning bare him to the hollow ships."
7788,BOOK XIII.,
7789,BOOK XIII.,"And Idomeneus relaxed not his mighty force, but ever was striving,"
7790,BOOK XIII.,"either to cover some one of the Trojans with black night, or himself to"
7791,BOOK XIII.,fall in warding off death from the Achaians. There the dear son of
7792,BOOK XIII.,"Aisyetes, fosterling of Zeus, even the hero Alkathoos, was slain, who"
7793,BOOK XIII.,"was son-in-law of Anchises, and had married the eldest of his"
7794,BOOK XIII.,"daughters, Hippodameia, whom her father and her lady mother dearly"
7795,BOOK XIII.,"loved in the halls, for she excelled all the maidens of her age in"
7796,BOOK XIII.,"beauty, and skill, and in wisdom, wherefore the best man in wide Troy"
7797,BOOK XIII.,"took her to wife. This Alkathoos did Poseidon subdue to Idomeneus,"
7798,BOOK XIII.,"throwing a spell over his shining eyes, and snaring his glorious limbs;"
7799,BOOK XIII.,"so that he might neither flee backwards, nor avoid the stroke, but"
7800,BOOK XIII.,"stood steady as a pillar, or a tree with lofty crown of leaves, when"
7801,BOOK XIII.,"the hero Idomeneus smote him in the midst of the breast with the spear,"
7802,BOOK XIII.,"and rent the coat of bronze about him, that aforetime warded death from"
7803,BOOK XIII.,"his body, but now rang harsh as it was rent by the spear. And he fell"
7804,BOOK XIII.,"with a crash, and the lance fixed in his heart, that, still beating,"
7805,BOOK XIII.,shook the butt-end of the spear. Then at length mighty Ares spent its
7806,BOOK XIII.,"fury there; but Idomeneus boasted terribly, and cried aloud:"
7807,BOOK XIII.,"“Deiphobos, are we to deem it fair acquittal that we have slain three"
7808,BOOK XIII.,"men for one, since thou boastest thus? Nay, sir, but stand thou up also"
7809,BOOK XIII.,"thyself against me, that thou mayst know what manner of son of Zeus am"
7810,BOOK XIII.,"I that have come hither! For Zeus first begat Minos, the warden of"
7811,BOOK XIII.,"Crete, and Minos got him a son, the noble Deukalion, and Deukalion"
7812,BOOK XIII.,"begat me, a prince over many men in wide Crete, and now have the ships"
7813,BOOK XIII.,"brought me hither, a bane to thee and thy father, and all the Trojans.”"
7814,BOOK XIII.,
7815,BOOK XIII.,"Thus he spake, but the thoughts of Deiphobos were divided, whether he"
7816,BOOK XIII.,"should retreat, and call to his aid some one of the great-hearted"
7817,BOOK XIII.,"Trojans, or should try the adventure alone. And on this wise to his"
7818,BOOK XIII.,"mind it seemed the better, to go after Aineias, whom he found standing"
7819,BOOK XIII.,"the last in the press, for Aineias was ever wroth against goodly Priam,"
7820,BOOK XIII.,"for that Priam gave him no honour, despite his valour among men. So"
7821,BOOK XIII.,"Deiphobos stood by him, and spake winged words to him: “Aineias, thou"
7822,BOOK XIII.,"counsellor of the Trojans, now verily there is great need that thou"
7823,BOOK XIII.,"shouldst succour thy sister’s husband, if any care for kin doth touch"
7824,BOOK XIII.,"thee. Nay follow, let us succour Alkathoos, thy sister’s husband, who"
7825,BOOK XIII.,"of old did cherish thee in his hall, while thou wert but a little one,"
7826,BOOK XIII.,"and now, lo, spear-famed Idomeneus hath stripped him of his arms!”"
7827,BOOK XIII.,
7828,BOOK XIII.,"So he spake, and roused the spirit in the breast of Aineias, who went"
7829,BOOK XIII.,"to seek Idomeneus, with high thoughts of war. But fear took not hold"
7830,BOOK XIII.,"upon Idomeneus, as though he had been some tender boy, but he stood at"
7831,BOOK XIII.,"bay, like a boar on the hills that trusteth to his strength, and abides"
7832,BOOK XIII.,"the great assailing throng of men in a lonely place, and he bristles up"
7833,BOOK XIII.,"his back, and his eyes shine with fire, while he whets his tusks, and"
7834,BOOK XIII.,is right eager to keep at bay both men and hounds. Even so stood
7835,BOOK XIII.,"spear-famed Idomeneus at bay against Aineias, that came to the rescue,"
7836,BOOK XIII.,"and gave ground no whit, but called on his comrades, glancing to"
7837,BOOK XIII.,"Askalaphos, and Aphareus, and Deipyros, and Meriones, and Antilochos,"
7838,BOOK XIII.,"all masters of the war-cry; them he spurred up to battle, and spake"
7839,BOOK XIII.,"winged words: “Hither, friends, and rescue me, all alone as I am, and"
7840,BOOK XIII.,"terribly I dread the onslaught of swift-footed Aineias, that is"
7841,BOOK XIII.,"assailing me; for he is right strong to destroy men in battle, and he"
7842,BOOK XIII.,"hath the flower of youth, the greatest avail that may be. Yea, if he"
7843,BOOK XIII.,"and I were of like age, and in this spirit whereof now we are, speedily"
7844,BOOK XIII.,should he or I achieve high victory.”
7845,BOOK XIII.,
7846,BOOK XIII.,"So he spake, and they all, being of one spirit in their hearts, stood"
7847,BOOK XIII.,"hard by each other, with buckler laid on shoulder. But Aineias, on the"
7848,BOOK XIII.,"other side, cried to his comrades, glancing to Deiphobos, and Paris,"
7849,BOOK XIII.,"and noble Agenor, that with him were leaders of the Trojans; and then"
7850,BOOK XIII.,"the hosts followed them, as sheep follow their leader to the water from"
7851,BOOK XIII.,"the pasture, and the shepherd is glad at heart; even so the heart of"
7852,BOOK XIII.,"Aineias was glad in his breast, when he saw the hosts of the people"
7853,BOOK XIII.,following to aid him.
7854,BOOK XIII.,
7855,BOOK XIII.,Then they rushed in close fight around Alkathoos with their long
7856,BOOK XIII.,"spears, and round their breasts the bronze rang terribly, as they aimed"
7857,BOOK XIII.,"at each other in the press, while two men of war beyond the rest,"
7858,BOOK XIII.,"Aineias and Idomeneus, the peers of Ares, were each striving to hew the"
7859,BOOK XIII.,flesh of the other with the pitiless bronze. Now Aineias first cast at
7860,BOOK XIII.,"Idomeneus, who steadily watching him avoided the spear of bronze, and"
7861,BOOK XIII.,"the point of Aineias went quivering in the earth, since vainly it had"
7862,BOOK XIII.,flown from his stalwart hand. But Idomeneus smote Oinomaos in the midst
7863,BOOK XIII.,"of the belly, and brake the plate of his corslet, and the bronze let"
7864,BOOK XIII.,"forth the bowels through the corslet, and he fell in the dust and"
7865,BOOK XIII.,clutched the earth in his palms. And Idomeneus drew forth the
7866,BOOK XIII.,"far-shadowing spear from the dead, but could not avail to strip the"
7867,BOOK XIII.,"rest of the fair armour from his shoulders, for the darts pressed hard"
7868,BOOK XIII.,"on him. Nay, and his feet no longer served him firmly in a charge, nor"
7869,BOOK XIII.,"could he rush after his own spear, nor avoid the foe. Wherefore in"
7870,BOOK XIII.,"close fight he still held off the pitiless day of destiny, but in"
7871,BOOK XIII.,retreat his feet no longer bore him swiftly from the battle. And as he
7872,BOOK XIII.,"was slowly departing, Deiphobos aimed at him with his shining spear,"
7873,BOOK XIII.,"for, verily he ever cherished a steadfast hatred against Idomeneus. But"
7874,BOOK XIII.,"this time, too, he missed him, and smote Askalaphos, the son of"
7875,BOOK XIII.,"Enyalios, with his dart, and the strong spear passed through his"
7876,BOOK XIII.,"shoulder, and he fell in the dust, and clutched the earth in his"
7877,BOOK XIII.,outstretched hand. But loud-voiced awful Ares was not yet aware at all
7878,BOOK XIII.,"that his son had fallen in strong battle, but he was reclining on the"
7879,BOOK XIII.,"peak of Olympus, beneath the golden clouds, being held there by the"
7880,BOOK XIII.,"design of Zeus, where also were the other deathless gods, restrained"
7881,BOOK XIII.,from the war.
7882,BOOK XIII.,
7883,BOOK XIII.,"Now the people rushed in close fight around Askalaphos, and Deiphobos"
7884,BOOK XIII.,"tore from Askalaphos his shining helm, but Meriones, the peer of swift"
7885,BOOK XIII.,"Ares, leaped forward and smote the arm of Deiphobos with his spear, and"
7886,BOOK XIII.,from his hand the vizored casque fell clanging to the ground. And
7887,BOOK XIII.,"Meriones sprang forth instantly, like a vulture, and drew the strong"
7888,BOOK XIII.,"spear from the shoulder of Deiphobos, and fell back among the throng of"
7889,BOOK XIII.,"his comrades. But the own brother of Deiphobos, Polites, stretched his"
7890,BOOK XIII.,"hands round his waist, and led him forth from the evil din of war, even"
7891,BOOK XIII.,"till he came to the swift horses, that waited for him behind the battle"
7892,BOOK XIII.,"and the fight, with their charioteer, and well-dight chariot. These"
7893,BOOK XIII.,"bore him heavily groaning to the city, worn with his hurt, and the"
7894,BOOK XIII.,blood ran down from his newly wounded arm.
7895,BOOK XIII.,
7896,BOOK XIII.,"But the rest still were fighting, and the war-cry rose unquenched."
7897,BOOK XIII.,"There Aineias rushed on Aphareus, son of Kaletor, and struck his"
7898,BOOK XIII.,"throat, that chanced to be turned to him, with the keen spear, and his"
7899,BOOK XIII.,"head dropped down and his shield and helm fell with him, and death that"
7900,BOOK XIII.,slays the spirit overwhelmed him. And Antilochos watched Thoon as he
7901,BOOK XIII.,"turned the other way, and leaped on him, and wounded him, severing all"
7902,BOOK XIII.,the vein that runs up the back till it reaches the neck; this he
7903,BOOK XIII.,"severed clean, and Thoon fell on his back in the dust, stretching out"
7904,BOOK XIII.,"both his hands to his comrades dear. Then Antilochos rushed on, and"
7905,BOOK XIII.,"stripped the armour from his shoulders, glancing around while the"
7906,BOOK XIII.,"Trojans gathered from here and there, and smote his wide shining"
7907,BOOK XIII.,"shield, yet did not avail to graze, behind the shield, the delicate"
7908,BOOK XIII.,"flesh of Antilochos with the pitiless bronze. For verily Poseidon, the"
7909,BOOK XIII.,"Shaker of the earth, did guard on every side the son of Nestor, even in"
7910,BOOK XIII.,the midst of the javelins. And never did Antilochos get free of the
7911,BOOK XIII.,"foe, but turned him about among them, nor ever was his spear at rest,"
7912,BOOK XIII.,"but always brandished and shaken, and the aim of his heart was to smite"
7913,BOOK XIII.,"a foeman from afar, or to set on him at close quarters. But as he was"
7914,BOOK XIII.,"aiming through the crowd, he escaped not the ken of Adamas, son of"
7915,BOOK XIII.,"Asios, who smote the midst of his shield with the sharp bronze, setting"
7916,BOOK XIII.,on nigh at hand; but Poseidon of the dark locks made his shaft of no
7917,BOOK XIII.,"avail, grudging him the life of Antilochos. And part of the spear abode"
7918,BOOK XIII.,"there, like a burned stake, in the shield of Antilochos, and half lay"
7919,BOOK XIII.,"on the earth, and back retreated Adamas to the ranks of his comrades,"
7920,BOOK XIII.,"avoiding Fate. But Meriones following after him as he departed, smote"
7921,BOOK XIII.,"him with a spear between the privy parts and the navel, where a wound"
7922,BOOK XIII.,is most baneful to wretched mortals. Even there he fixed the spear in
7923,BOOK XIII.,"him and he fell, and writhed about the spear, even as a bull that"
7924,BOOK XIII.,herdsmen on the hills drag along perforce when they have bound him with
7925,BOOK XIII.,"withes, so he when he was smitten writhed for a moment, not for long,"
7926,BOOK XIII.,"till the hero Meriones came near, and drew the spear out of his body."
7927,BOOK XIII.,And darkness covered his eyes.
7928,BOOK XIII.,
7929,BOOK XIII.,"And Helenos in close fight smote Deipyros on the temple, with a great"
7930,BOOK XIII.,"Thracian sword, and tore away the helm, and the helm, being dislodged,"
7931,BOOK XIII.,"fell on the ground, and one of the Achaians in the fight picked it up"
7932,BOOK XIII.,as it rolled between his feet. But dark night covered the eyes of
7933,BOOK XIII.,Deipyros.
7934,BOOK XIII.,
7935,BOOK XIII.,"Then grief took hold of the son of Atreus, Menelaos of the loud"
7936,BOOK XIII.,"war-cry, and he went with a threat against the warrior Helenos, the"
7937,BOOK XIII.,"prince, shaking his sharp spear, while the other drew the centre-piece"
7938,BOOK XIII.,"of his bow. And both at once were making ready to let fly, one with his"
7939,BOOK XIII.,"sharp spear, the other with the arrow from the string. Then the son of"
7940,BOOK XIII.,"Priam smote Menelaos on the breast with his arrow, on the plate of the"
7941,BOOK XIII.,"corslet, and off flew the bitter arrow. Even as from a broad shovel in"
7942,BOOK XIII.,"a great threshing floor, fly the black-skinned beans and pulse, before"
7943,BOOK XIII.,"the whistling wind, and the stress of the winnower’s shovel, even so"
7944,BOOK XIII.,from the corslet of the renowned Menelaos flew glancing far aside the
7945,BOOK XIII.,"bitter arrow. But the son of Atreus, Menelaos of the loud war-cry,"
7946,BOOK XIII.,"smote the hand of Helenos wherein he held the polished bow, and into"
7947,BOOK XIII.,"the bow, clean through the hand, was driven the spear of bronze. Back"
7948,BOOK XIII.,"he withdrew to the ranks of his comrades, avoiding Fate, with his hand"
7949,BOOK XIII.,"hanging down at his side, for the ashen spear dragged after him. And"
7950,BOOK XIII.,"the great-hearted Agenor drew the spear from his hand, and himself"
7951,BOOK XIII.,"bound up the hand with a band of twisted sheep’s-wool, a sling that a"
7952,BOOK XIII.,"squire carried for him, the shepherd of the host."
7953,BOOK XIII.,
7954,BOOK XIII.,"Then Peisandros made straight for renowned Menelaos, but an evil Fate"
7955,BOOK XIII.,"was leading him to the end of Death; by thee, Menelaos, to be overcome"
7956,BOOK XIII.,in the dread strife of battle. Now when the twain had come nigh in
7957,BOOK XIII.,"onset upon each other, the son of Atreus missed, and his spear was"
7958,BOOK XIII.,"turned aside, but Peisandros smote the shield of renowned Menelaos, yet"
7959,BOOK XIII.,"availed not to drive the bronze clean through, for the wide shield"
7960,BOOK XIII.,"caught it, and the spear brake in the socket, yet Peisandros rejoiced"
7961,BOOK XIII.,"in his heart, and hoped for the victory. But the son of Atreus drew his"
7962,BOOK XIII.,"silver-studded sword, and leaped upon Peisandros. And Peisandros, under"
7963,BOOK XIII.,"his shield, clutched his goodly axe of fine bronze, with long and"
7964,BOOK XIII.,"polished haft of olive-wood, and the twain set upon each other. Then"
7965,BOOK XIII.,"Peisandros smote the crest of the helmet shaded with horse hair, close"
7966,BOOK XIII.,"below the very plume, but Menelaos struck the other, as he came"
7967,BOOK XIII.,"forward, on the brow, above the base of the nose, and the bones"
7968,BOOK XIII.,"cracked, and the eyes, all bloody, fell at his feet in the dust. Then"
7969,BOOK XIII.,"he bowed and fell, and Menelaos set his foot on his breast, and"
7970,BOOK XIII.,"stripped him of his arms, and triumphed, saying: “Even thus then"
7971,BOOK XIII.,"surely, ye will leave the ships of the Danaans of the swift steeds, ye"
7972,BOOK XIII.,"Trojans overweening, insatiate of the dread din of war. Yea, and ye"
7973,BOOK XIII.,"shall not lack all other reproof and shame, wherewith ye made me"
7974,BOOK XIII.,"ashamed, ye hounds of evil, having no fear in your hearts of the strong"
7975,BOOK XIII.,"wrath of loud-thundering Zeus, the god of guest and host, who one day"
7976,BOOK XIII.,will destroy your steep citadel. O ye that wantonly carried away my
7977,BOOK XIII.,"wedded wife and many of my possessions, when ye were entertained by"
7978,BOOK XIII.,"her, now again ye are fain to throw ruinous fire on the seafaring"
7979,BOOK XIII.,"ships, and to slay the Achaian heroes. Nay, but ye will yet refrain you"
7980,BOOK XIII.,"from battle, for as eager as ye be. O father Zeus, verily they say that"
7981,BOOK XIII.,"thou dost excel in wisdom all others, both gods and men, and all these"
7982,BOOK XIII.,things are from thee. How wondrously art thou favouring men of
7983,BOOK XIII.,"violence, even the Trojans, whose might is ever iniquitous, nor can"
7984,BOOK XIII.,they have their fill of the din of equal war. Of all things there is
7985,BOOK XIII.,"satiety, yea, even of love and sleep, and of sweet song, and dance"
7986,BOOK XIII.,"delectable, whereof a man would sooner have his fill than of war, but"
7987,BOOK XIII.,the Trojans are insatiable of battle.”
7988,BOOK XIII.,
7989,BOOK XIII.,"Thus noble Menelaos spake, and stripped the bloody arms from the body,"
7990,BOOK XIII.,"and gave them to his comrades, and instantly himself went forth again,"
7991,BOOK XIII.,"and mingled in the forefront of the battle. Then Harpalion, the son of"
7992,BOOK XIII.,"king Pylaimenes, leaped out against him, Harpalion that followed his"
7993,BOOK XIII.,"dear father to Troy, to the war, nor ever came again to his own"
7994,BOOK XIII.,country. He then smote the middle of the shield of Atreus’ son with his
7995,BOOK XIII.,"spear, in close fight, yet availed not to drive the bronze clean"
7996,BOOK XIII.,"through, but fell back into the host of his comrades, avoiding Fate,"
7997,BOOK XIII.,"glancing round every way, lest one should wound his flesh with the"
7998,BOOK XIII.,bronze. But Meriones shot at him as he retreated with a bronze-shod
7999,BOOK XIII.,"arrow, and smote him in the right buttock, and the arrow went right"
8000,BOOK XIII.,"through the bladder and came out under the bone. And sitting down, even"
8001,BOOK XIII.,"there, in the arms of his dear comrades, he breathed away his soul,"
8002,BOOK XIII.,"lying stretched like a worm on the earth, and out flowed the black"
8003,BOOK XIII.,"blood, and wetted the ground. And the Paphlagonians great of heart,"
8004,BOOK XIII.,"tended him busily, and set him in a chariot, and drove him to sacred"
8005,BOOK XIII.,"Ilios sorrowing, and with them went his father, shedding tears, and"
8006,BOOK XIII.,there was no atonement for his dead son.
8007,BOOK XIII.,
8008,BOOK XIII.,"Now Paris was very wroth at heart by reason of his slaying, for he had"
8009,BOOK XIII.,"been his host among the many Paphlagonions, wherefore, in wrath for his"
8010,BOOK XIII.,"sake, he let fly a bronze-shod arrow. Now there was a certain Euchenor,"
8011,BOOK XIII.,"the son of Polyidos the seer, a rich man and a good, whose dwelling was"
8012,BOOK XIII.,"in Corinth. And well he knew his own ruinous fate, when he went on"
8013,BOOK XIII.,"ship-board, for often would the old man, the good Polyidos, tell him,"
8014,BOOK XIII.,"that he must either perish of a sore disease in his halls, or go with"
8015,BOOK XIII.,"the ships of the Achaians, and be overcome by the Trojans. Wherefore he"
8016,BOOK XIII.,"avoided at once the heavy war-fine of the Achaians, and the hateful"
8017,BOOK XIII.,"disease, that so he might not know any anguish. This man did Paris"
8018,BOOK XIII.,"smite beneath the jaw and under the ear, and swiftly his spirit"
8019,BOOK XIII.,"departed from his limbs, and, lo, dread darkness overshadowed him."
8020,BOOK XIII.,
8021,BOOK XIII.,"So they fought like flaming fire, but Hector, beloved of Zeus, had not"
8022,BOOK XIII.,"heard nor knew at all that, on the left of the ships, his host was"
8023,BOOK XIII.,"being subdued by the Argives, and soon would the Achaians have won"
8024,BOOK XIII.,"renown, so mighty was the Holder and Shaker of the earth that urged on"
8025,BOOK XIII.,"the Argives; yea, and himself mightily defended them. But Hector kept"
8026,BOOK XIII.,"where at first he had leaped within the walls and the gate, and broken"
8027,BOOK XIII.,"the serried ranks of shield-bearing Danaans, even where were the ships"
8028,BOOK XIII.,"of Aias and Protesilaos, drawn up on the beach of the hoary sea, while"
8029,BOOK XIII.,"above the wall was builded lowest, and thereby chiefly the heroes and"
8030,BOOK XIII.,their horses were raging in battle.
8031,BOOK XIII.,
8032,BOOK XIII.,"There the Boiotians, and Ionians with trailing tunics, and Lokrians and"
8033,BOOK XIII.,Phthians and illustrious Epeians scarcely availed to stay his onslaught
8034,BOOK XIII.,"on the ships, nor yet could they drive back from them noble Hector,"
8035,BOOK XIII.,like a flame of fire. And there were the picked men of the Athenians;
8036,BOOK XIII.,among them Menestheus son of Peteos was the leader; and there followed
8037,BOOK XIII.,"with him Pheidas and Stichios, and brave Bias, while the Epeians were"
8038,BOOK XIII.,"led by Meges, son of Phyleus, and Amphion and Drakios, and in front of"
8039,BOOK XIII.,"the Phthians were Medon, and Podarkes resolute in war. Now the one,"
8040,BOOK XIII.,"Medon, was the bastard son of noble Oileus, and brother of Aias, and he"
8041,BOOK XIII.,"dwelt in Phylake, far from his own country, for that he had slain a"
8042,BOOK XIII.,"man, the brother of his stepmother Eriopis, wife of Oileus. But the"
8043,BOOK XIII.,"other, Podarkes, was the son of Iphiklos son of Phylakos, and they in"
8044,BOOK XIII.,"their armour, in the van of the great-hearted Phthians, were defending"
8045,BOOK XIII.,"the ships, and fighting among the Boiotians."
8046,BOOK XIII.,
8047,BOOK XIII.,"Now never at all did Aias, the swift son of Oileus, depart from the"
8048,BOOK XIII.,"side of Aias, son of Telamon, nay, not for an instant, but even as in"
8049,BOOK XIII.,fallow land two wine-dark oxen with equal heart strain at the shapen
8050,BOOK XIII.,"plough, and round the roots of their horns springeth up abundant sweat,"
8051,BOOK XIII.,"and nought sunders them but the polished yoke, as they labour through"
8052,BOOK XIII.,"the furrow, till the end of the furrow brings them up, so stood the two"
8053,BOOK XIII.,Aiantes close by each other. Now verily did many and noble hosts of his
8054,BOOK XIII.,"comrades follow with the son of Telamon, and bore his shield when"
8055,BOOK XIII.,labour and sweat came upon his limbs. But the Lokrians followed not
8056,BOOK XIII.,"with the high-hearted son of Oileus, for their hearts were not"
8057,BOOK XIII.,"steadfast in close brunt of battle, seeing that they had no helmets of"
8058,BOOK XIII.,"bronze, shadowy with horse-hair plumes, nor round shields, nor ashen"
8059,BOOK XIII.,"spears, but trusting in bows and well-twisted slings of sheep’s wool,"
8060,BOOK XIII.,"they followed with him to Ilios. Therewith, in the war, they shot thick"
8061,BOOK XIII.,"and fast, and brake the ranks of the Trojans. So the one party in"
8062,BOOK XIII.,"front, with their well-dight arms contended with the Trojans, and with"
8063,BOOK XIII.,"Hector arrayed in bronze, while the others from behind kept shooting"
8064,BOOK XIII.,"from their ambush, and the Trojans lost all memory of the joy of"
8065,BOOK XIII.,"battle, for the arrows confounded them."
8066,BOOK XIII.,
8067,BOOK XIII.,There then right ruefully from the ships and the huts would the Trojans
8068,BOOK XIII.,"have withdrawn to windy Ilios, had not Polydamas come near valiant"
8069,BOOK XIII.,"Hector and said: “Hector, thou art hard to be persuaded by them that"
8070,BOOK XIII.,would counsel thee; for that god has given thee excellence in the works
8071,BOOK XIII.,"of war, therefore in council also thou art fain to excel other men in"
8072,BOOK XIII.,knowledge. But in nowise wilt thou be able to take everything on
8073,BOOK XIII.,"thyself. For to one man has god given for his portion the works of war,"
8074,BOOK XIII.,"[to another the dance, to another the lute and song,] but in the heart"
8075,BOOK XIII.,"of yet another hath far-seeing Zeus placed an excellent understanding,"
8076,BOOK XIII.,"whereof many men get gain, yea he saveth many an one, and himself best"
8077,BOOK XIII.,"knoweth it. But, lo, I will speak even as it seemeth best to me. Behold"
8078,BOOK XIII.,"all about thee the circle of war is blazing, but the great-hearted"
8079,BOOK XIII.,"Trojans, now that they have got down the wall, are some with their arms"
8080,BOOK XIII.,"standing aloof and some are fighting, few men against a host, being"
8081,BOOK XIII.,"scattered among the ships. Nay, withdraw thee, and call hither all the"
8082,BOOK XIII.,"best of the warriors. Thereafter shall we take all counsel carefully,"
8083,BOOK XIII.,"whether we should fall on the ships of many benches, if indeed god"
8084,BOOK XIII.,"willeth to give us victory, or after counsel held, should return"
8085,BOOK XIII.,unharmed from the ships. For verily I fear lest the Achaians repay
8086,BOOK XIII.,"their debt of yesterday, since by the ships there tarrieth a man"
8087,BOOK XIII.,"insatiate of war, and never, methinks, will he wholly stand aloof from"
8088,BOOK XIII.,battle.”
8089,BOOK XIII.,
8090,BOOK XIII.,"So spake Polydamas, and his safe counsel pleased Hector well, who"
8091,BOOK XIII.,"[straightaway sprang to earth from the chariot with his arms, and]"
8092,BOOK XIII.,"spake to him winged words and said: “Polydamas, do thou stay here all"
8093,BOOK XIII.,"the best of the host, but I will go thither to face the war, and"
8094,BOOK XIII.,"swiftly will return again, when I have straitly laid on them my"
8095,BOOK XIII.,commands.”
8096,BOOK XIII.,
8097,BOOK XIII.,"So he spake, and set forth, in semblance like a snowy mountain, and"
8098,BOOK XIII.,shouting aloud he flew through the Trojans and allies. And they all
8099,BOOK XIII.,"sped to Polydamas, the kindly son of Panthoos, when they heard the"
8100,BOOK XIII.,"voice of Hector. But he went seeking Deiphobos, and the strong prince"
8101,BOOK XIII.,"Helenos, and Adamas son of Asios, and Asios son of Hyrtakos, among the"
8102,BOOK XIII.,"warriors in the foremost line, if anywhere he might find them. But them"
8103,BOOK XIII.,"he found not at all unharmed, nor free of bane, but, lo, some among the"
8104,BOOK XIII.,"sterns of the ships of the Achaians lay lifeless, slain by the hands of"
8105,BOOK XIII.,"the Argives, and some were within the wall wounded by thrust or cast."
8106,BOOK XIII.,"But one he readily found, on the left of the dolorous battle, goodly"
8107,BOOK XIII.,"Alexandros, the lord of fair-tressed Helen, heartening his comrades and"
8108,BOOK XIII.,"speeding them to war. And he drew near to him, and addressed him with"
8109,BOOK XIII.,"words of shame: “Thou evil Paris, fairest of face, thou that lustest"
8110,BOOK XIII.,"for women, thou seducer, where, prithee, are Deiphobos, and the strong"
8111,BOOK XIII.,"prince Helenos, and Adamas son of Asios, and Asios son of Hyrtakos, and"
8112,BOOK XIII.,"where is Othryoneus? Now hath all high Ilios perished utterly. Now,"
8113,BOOK XIII.,"too, thou seest, is sheer destruction sure.”"
8114,BOOK XIII.,
8115,BOOK XIII.,"Then godlike Alexandros answered him again saying: “Hector, since thy"
8116,BOOK XIII.,"mind is to blame one that is blameless, some other day might I rather"
8117,BOOK XIII.,"withdraw me from the war, since my mother bare not even me wholly a"
8118,BOOK XIII.,coward. For from the time that thou didst gather the battle of thy
8119,BOOK XIII.,"comrades about the ships, from that hour do we abide here, and war with"
8120,BOOK XIII.,the Danaans ceaselessly; and our comrades concerning whom thou
8121,BOOK XIII.,inquirest are slain. Only Deiphobos and the strong prince Helenos have
8122,BOOK XIII.,"both withdrawn, both of them being wounded in the hand with long"
8123,BOOK XIII.,"spears, for Kronion kept death away from them. But now lead on,"
8124,BOOK XIII.,"wheresoever thy heart and spirit bid thee, and we will follow with thee"
8125,BOOK XIII.,"eagerly, nor methinks shall we lack for valour, as far as we have"
8126,BOOK XIII.,"strength; but beyond his strength may no man fight, howsoever eager he"
8127,BOOK XIII.,be.”
8128,BOOK XIII.,
8129,BOOK XIII.,"So spake the hero, and persuaded his brother’s heart, and they went"
8130,BOOK XIII.,"forth where the war and din were thickest, round Kebriones, and noble"
8131,BOOK XIII.,"Polydamas, and Phalkes, and Orthaios, and godlike Polyphetes, and"
8132,BOOK XIII.,"Palmys, and Askanios, and Morys, son of Hippotion, who had come in"
8133,BOOK XIII.,"their turn, out of deep-soiled Askanie, on the morn before, and now"
8134,BOOK XIII.,Zeus urged them to fight. And these set forth like the blast of violent
8135,BOOK XIII.,"winds, that rushes earthward beneath the thunder of father Zeus, and"
8136,BOOK XIII.,"with marvellous din doth mingle with the salt sea, and therein are many"
8137,BOOK XIII.,"swelling waves of the loud roaring sea, arched over and white with"
8138,BOOK XIII.,"foam, some vanward, others in the rear; even so the Trojans arrayed in"
8139,BOOK XIII.,"van and rear and shining with bronze, followed after their leaders. And"
8140,BOOK XIII.,"Hector son of Priam was leading them, the peer of Ares, the bane of"
8141,BOOK XIII.,"men. In front he held the circle of his shield, thick with hides, and"
8142,BOOK XIII.,"plates of beaten bronze, and on his temples swayed his shining helm."
8143,BOOK XIII.,"And everywhere he went in advance and made trial of the ranks, if"
8144,BOOK XIII.,perchance they would yield to him as he charged under cover of his
8145,BOOK XIII.,shield. But he could not confound the heart within the breast of the
8146,BOOK XIII.,"Achaians. And Aias, stalking with long strides, challenged him first:"
8147,BOOK XIII.,"“Sir, draw nigh, wherefore dost thou vainly try to dismay the Argives?"
8148,BOOK XIII.,"We are in no wise ignorant of war, but by the cruel scourge of Zeus are"
8149,BOOK XIII.,we Achaians vanquished. Surely now thy heart hopes utterly to spoil the
8150,BOOK XIII.,"ships, but we too have hands presently to hold our own. Verily your"
8151,BOOK XIII.,peopled city will long ere that beneath our hands be taken and sacked.
8152,BOOK XIII.,"But for thee, I tell thee that the time is at hand, when thou shalt"
8153,BOOK XIII.,"pray in thy flight to father Zeus, and the other immortal gods, that"
8154,BOOK XIII.,thy fair-maned steeds may be fleeter than falcons: thy steeds that are
8155,BOOK XIII.,"to bear thee to the city, as they storm in dust across the plain.”"
8156,BOOK XIII.,
8157,BOOK XIII.,"And even as he spake, a bird flew forth on the right hand, an eagle of"
8158,BOOK XIII.,"lofty flight, and the host of the Achaians shouted thereat, encouraged"
8159,BOOK XIII.,"by the omen, but renowned Hector answered: “Aias, thou blundering"
8160,BOOK XIII.,"boaster, what sayest thou! Would that indeed I were for ever as surely"
8161,BOOK XIII.,"the son of aegis-bearing Zeus, and that my mother were lady Hera, and"
8162,BOOK XIII.,"that I were held in such honour as Apollo and Athene, as verily this"
8163,BOOK XIII.,day is to bring utter evil on all the Argives! And thou among them
8164,BOOK XIII.,"shalt be slain, if thou hast the heart to await my long spear, which"
8165,BOOK XIII.,"shall rend thy lily skin, and thou shalt glut with thy fat and flesh"
8166,BOOK XIII.,"the birds and dogs of the Trojans, falling among the ships of the"
8167,BOOK XIII.,Achaians.”
8168,BOOK XIII.,
8169,BOOK XIII.,"So he spake and led the way, and they followed with wondrous din, and"
8170,BOOK XIII.,the whole host shouted behind. And the Argives on the other side
8171,BOOK XIII.,"answered with a shout, and forgot not their valiance, but abode the"
8172,BOOK XIII.,onslaught of the bravest of the Trojans. And the cry of the two hosts
8173,BOOK XIII.,"went up through the higher air, to the splendour of Zeus."
8174,BOOK XIII.,
8175,BOOK XIII.,
8176,BOOK XIII.,
8177,BOOK XIII.,
8178,BOOK XIV.,BOOK XIV.
8179,BOOK XIV.,
8180,BOOK XIV.,
8181,BOOK XIV.,"How Sleep and Hera beguiled Zeus to slumber on the heights of Ida, and"
8182,BOOK XIV.,"Poseidon spurred on the Achaians to resist Hector, and how Hector was"
8183,BOOK XIV.,wounded.
8184,BOOK XIV.,
8185,BOOK XIV.,
8186,BOOK XIV.,"Yet the cry of battle escaped not Nestor, albeit at his wine, but he"
8187,BOOK XIV.,"spake winged words to the son of Asklepios: “Bethink thee, noble"
8188,BOOK XIV.,"Machaon, what had best be done; lo, louder waxes the cry of the strong"
8189,BOOK XIV.,"warriors by the ships. Nay, now sit where thou art, and drink the"
8190,BOOK XIV.,"bright wine, till Hekamede of the fair tresses shall heat warm water"
8191,BOOK XIV.,"for the bath, and wash away the clotted blood, but I will speedily go"
8192,BOOK XIV.,forth and come to a place of outlook.”
8193,BOOK XIV.,
8194,BOOK XIV.,"Therewith he took the well-wrought shield of his son, horse-taming"
8195,BOOK XIV.,"Thrasymedes, which was lying in the hut, all glistering with bronze,"
8196,BOOK XIV.,"for the son had the shield of his father. And he seized a strong spear,"
8197,BOOK XIV.,"with a point of keen bronze, and stood outside the hut, and straightway"
8198,BOOK XIV.,"beheld a deed of shame, the Achaians fleeing in rout, and the"
8199,BOOK XIV.,"high-hearted Trojans driving them, and the wall of the Achaians was"
8200,BOOK XIV.,"overthrown. And as when the great sea is troubled with a dumb wave, and"
8201,BOOK XIV.,"dimly bodes the sudden paths of the shrill winds, but is still unmoved"
8202,BOOK XIV.,"nor yet rolled forward or to either side, until some steady gale comes"
8203,BOOK XIV.,"down from Zeus, even so the old man pondered,—his mind divided this way"
8204,BOOK XIV.,"and that,—whether he should fare into the press of the Danaans of the"
8205,BOOK XIV.,"swift steeds, or go after Agamemnon, son of Atreus, shepherd of the"
8206,BOOK XIV.,"host. And thus as he pondered, it seemed to him the better counsel to"
8207,BOOK XIV.,go to the son of Atreus. Meanwhile they were warring and slaying each
8208,BOOK XIV.,"other, and the stout bronze rang about their bodies as they were thrust"
8209,BOOK XIV.,with swords and double-pointed spears.
8210,BOOK XIV.,
8211,BOOK XIV.,"Now the kings, the fosterlings of Zeus, encountered Nestor, as they"
8212,BOOK XIV.,"went up from the ships, even they that were wounded with the bronze,"
8213,BOOK XIV.,"Tydeus’ son, and Odysseus, and Agamemnon, son of Atreus. For far apart"
8214,BOOK XIV.,"from the battle were their ships drawn up, on the shore of the grey"
8215,BOOK XIV.,"sea, for these were the first they had drawn up to the plain, but had"
8216,BOOK XIV.,builded the wall in front of the hindmost. For in no wise might the
8217,BOOK XIV.,"beach, for as wide as it was, hold all the ships, and the host was"
8218,BOOK XIV.,"straitened. Wherefore they drew up the ships row within row, and filled"
8219,BOOK XIV.,up the wide mouth of all the shore that the headlands held between
8220,BOOK XIV.,"them. Therefore the kings were going together, leaning on their spears,"
8221,BOOK XIV.,"to look on the war and fray, and the heart of each was sore within his"
8222,BOOK XIV.,"breast. And the old man met them, even Nestor, and caused the spirit to"
8223,BOOK XIV.,fail within the breasts of the Achaians.
8224,BOOK XIV.,
8225,BOOK XIV.,"And mighty Agamemnon spake and accosted him: “O Nestor, son of Neleus,"
8226,BOOK XIV.,"great glory of the Achaians, wherefore dost thou come hither and hast"
8227,BOOK XIV.,"deserted the war, the bane of men? Lo, I fear the accomplishment of the"
8228,BOOK XIV.,"word that dread Hector spake, and the threat wherewith he threatened"
8229,BOOK XIV.,"us, speaking in the assembly of the Trojans, namely, that never would"
8230,BOOK XIV.,"he return to Ilios from the ships, till he had burned the ships with"
8231,BOOK XIV.,"fire, and slain the men. Even so he spake, and, lo, now all these"
8232,BOOK XIV.,"things are being fulfilled. Alas, surely even the other well-greaved"
8233,BOOK XIV.,"Achaians store wrath against me in their hearts, like Achilles, and"
8234,BOOK XIV.,have no desire to fight by the rearmost ships.”
8235,BOOK XIV.,
8236,BOOK XIV.,Then Nestor of Gerenia the knight answered him saying “Verily these
8237,BOOK XIV.,"things are now at hand, and being accomplished, nor otherwise could"
8238,BOOK XIV.,"Zeus himself contrive them, he that thundereth on high. For, lo, the"
8239,BOOK XIV.,"wall is overthrown, wherein we trusted that it should be an unbroken"
8240,BOOK XIV.,bulwark of the ships and of our own bodies. And these men by the swift
8241,BOOK XIV.,"ships have endless battle without sparing, and no more couldst thou"
8242,BOOK XIV.,"tell, howsoever closely thou mightst spy, from what side the Achaians"
8243,BOOK XIV.,"are driven in rout, so confusedly are they slain, and the cry of battle"
8244,BOOK XIV.,"goeth up to heaven. But let us take counsel, how these things may best"
8245,BOOK XIV.,"be done, if wit may do aught: but into the war I counsel not that we"
8246,BOOK XIV.,"should go down, for in no wise may a wounded man do battle.”"
8247,BOOK XIV.,
8248,BOOK XIV.,"Then Agamemnon king of men answered him again: “Nestor, for that they"
8249,BOOK XIV.,"are warring by the rearmost ships, and the well-builded wall hath"
8250,BOOK XIV.,"availed not, nor the trench, whereat the Achaians endured so much"
8251,BOOK XIV.,"labour, hoping in their hearts that it should be the unbroken bulwark"
8252,BOOK XIV.,"of the ships, and of their own bodies—such it seemeth must be the will"
8253,BOOK XIV.,"of Zeus supreme, [that the Achaians should perish here nameless far"
8254,BOOK XIV.,"from Argos]. For I knew it when he was forward to aid the Danaans, and"
8255,BOOK XIV.,now I know that he is giving to the Trojans glory like that of the
8256,BOOK XIV.,"blessed gods, and hath bound our hands and our strength. But come, as I"
8257,BOOK XIV.,"declare, let us all obey. Let us drag down the ships that are drawn up"
8258,BOOK XIV.,"in the first line near to the sea, and speed them all forth to the salt"
8259,BOOK XIV.,"sea divine, and moor them far out with stones, till the divine night"
8260,BOOK XIV.,"comes, if even at night the Trojans will refrain from war, and then"
8261,BOOK XIV.,might we drag down all the ships. For there is no shame in fleeing from
8262,BOOK XIV.,"ruin, yea, even in the night. Better doth he fare who flees from"
8263,BOOK XIV.,"trouble, than he that is overtaken.”"
8264,BOOK XIV.,
8265,BOOK XIV.,"Then, looking on him sternly, spake Odysseus of many counsels: “Atreus’"
8266,BOOK XIV.,"son, what word hath passed the door of thy lips? Man of mischief, sure"
8267,BOOK XIV.,"thou shouldst lead some other inglorious army, not be king among us, to"
8268,BOOK XIV.,"whom Zeus hath given it, from youth even unto age, to wind the skein of"
8269,BOOK XIV.,"grievous wars, till every man of us perish. Art thou indeed so eager to"
8270,BOOK XIV.,"leave the wide-wayed city of the Trojans, the city for which we endure"
8271,BOOK XIV.,"with sorrow so many evils? Be silent, lest some other of the Achaians"
8272,BOOK XIV.,"hear this word, that no man should so much as suffer to pass through"
8273,BOOK XIV.,"his mouth, none that understandeth in his heart how to speak fit"
8274,BOOK XIV.,"counsel, none that is a sceptred king, and hath hosts obeying him so"
8275,BOOK XIV.,many as the Argives over whom thou reignest. And now I wholly scorn thy
8276,BOOK XIV.,"thoughts, such a word as thou hast uttered, thou that, in the midst of"
8277,BOOK XIV.,"war and battle, dost bid us draw down the well-timbered ships to the"
8278,BOOK XIV.,"sea, that even more than ever the Trojans may possess their desire,"
8279,BOOK XIV.,"albeit they win the mastery even now, and sheer destruction fall upon"
8280,BOOK XIV.,"us. For the Achaians will not make good the war, when the ships are"
8281,BOOK XIV.,"drawn down to the salt sea, but will look round about to flee, and"
8282,BOOK XIV.,"withdraw from battle. There will thy counsel work a mischief, O marshal"
8283,BOOK XIV.,of the host!”
8284,BOOK XIV.,
8285,BOOK XIV.,"Then the king of men, Agamemnon, answered him: “Odysseus, right sharply"
8286,BOOK XIV.,"hast thou touched my heart with thy stern reproof: nay, I do not bid"
8287,BOOK XIV.,"the sons of the Achaians to drag, against their will, the well-timbered"
8288,BOOK XIV.,ships to the salt sea. Now perchance there may be one who will utter a
8289,BOOK XIV.,"wiser counsel than this of mine,—a young man or an old,—welcome would"
8290,BOOK XIV.,it be to me.”
8291,BOOK XIV.,
8292,BOOK XIV.,Then Diomedes of the loud war-cry spake also among them: “The man is
8293,BOOK XIV.,"near,—not long shall we seek him, if ye be willing to be persuaded of"
8294,BOOK XIV.,"me, and each of you be not resentful at all, because in years I am the"
8295,BOOK XIV.,"youngest among you. Nay, but I too boast me to come by lineage of a"
8296,BOOK XIV.,"noble sire, Tydeus, whom in Thebes the piled-up earth doth cover. For"
8297,BOOK XIV.,"Portheus had three well-born children, and they dwelt in Pleuron, and"
8298,BOOK XIV.,"steep Kalydon, even Agrios and Melas, and the third was Oineus the"
8299,BOOK XIV.,"knight, the father of my father, and in valour he excelled the others."
8300,BOOK XIV.,"And there he abode, but my father dwelt at Argos, whither he had"
8301,BOOK XIV.,"wandered, for so Zeus and the other gods willed that it should be. And"
8302,BOOK XIV.,"he wedded one of the daughters of Adrastos, and dwelt in a house full"
8303,BOOK XIV.,"of livelihood, and had wheat-bearing fields enow, and many orchards of"
8304,BOOK XIV.,"trees apart, and many sheep were his, and in skill with the spear he"
8305,BOOK XIV.,"excelled all the Achaians: these things ye must have heard, if I speak"
8306,BOOK XIV.,sooth. Therefore ye could not say that I am weak and a coward by
8307,BOOK XIV.,"lineage, and so dishonour my spoken counsel, that well I may speak. Let"
8308,BOOK XIV.,"us go down to the battle, wounded as we are, since we needs must; and"
8309,BOOK XIV.,"then might we hold ourselves aloof from the battle, beyond the range of"
8310,BOOK XIV.,"darts, lest any take wound upon wound; but the others will we spur on,"
8311,BOOK XIV.,"even them that aforetime gave place to their passion, and stand apart,"
8312,BOOK XIV.,and fight not.”
8313,BOOK XIV.,
8314,BOOK XIV.,"So he spake, and they all heard him readily, and obeyed him. And they"
8315,BOOK XIV.,"set forth, led by Agamemnon the king of men."
8316,BOOK XIV.,
8317,BOOK XIV.,"Now the renowned Earth-shaker held no vain watch, but went with them in"
8318,BOOK XIV.,"the guise of an ancient man, and he seized the right hand of Agamemnon,"
8319,BOOK XIV.,"Atreus’ son, and uttering winged words he spake to him, saying:"
8320,BOOK XIV.,"“Atreides, now methinks the ruinous heart of Achilles rejoices in his"
8321,BOOK XIV.,"breast, as he beholds the slaughter and flight of the Achaians, since"
8322,BOOK XIV.,"he hath no wisdom, not a grain. Nay, even so may he perish likewise,"
8323,BOOK XIV.,"and god mar him. But with thee the blessed gods are not utterly wroth,"
8324,BOOK XIV.,"nay, even yet methinks the leaders and rulers of the Trojans will cover"
8325,BOOK XIV.,"the wide plain with dust, and thyself shalt see them fleeing to the"
8326,BOOK XIV.,city from the ships and the huts.”
8327,BOOK XIV.,
8328,BOOK XIV.,"So spake he, and shouted mightily, as he sped over the plain. And loud"
8329,BOOK XIV.,"as nine thousand men, or ten thousand cry in battle, when they join the"
8330,BOOK XIV.,"strife of war, so mighty was the cry that the strong Shaker of the"
8331,BOOK XIV.,"earth sent forth from his breast, and great strength he put into the"
8332,BOOK XIV.,"heart of each of the Achaians, to strive and war unceasingly."
8333,BOOK XIV.,
8334,BOOK XIV.,"Now Hera of the golden throne stood on the peak of Olympus, and saw"
8335,BOOK XIV.,"with her eyes, and anon knew him that was her brother and her lord’s"
8336,BOOK XIV.,"going to and fro through the glorious fight, and she rejoiced in her"
8337,BOOK XIV.,heart. And she beheld Zeus sitting on the topmost crest of
8338,BOOK XIV.,"many-fountained Ida, and to her heart he was hateful. Then she took"
8339,BOOK XIV.,"thought, the ox-eyed lady Hera, how she might beguile the mind of"
8340,BOOK XIV.,aegis-bearing Zeus. And this seemed to her in her heart to be the best
8341,BOOK XIV.,"counsel, namely to fare to Ida, when she had well adorned herself, if"
8342,BOOK XIV.,perchance he would desire to sleep beside her and embrace her body in
8343,BOOK XIV.,"love, and a sweet sleep and a kindly she could pour on his eye lids and"
8344,BOOK XIV.,"his crafty wits. And she set forth to her bower, that her dear son"
8345,BOOK XIV.,"Hephaistos had fashioned, and therein had made fast strong doors on the"
8346,BOOK XIV.,"pillars, with a secret bolt, that no other god might open. There did"
8347,BOOK XIV.,she enter in and closed the shining doors. With ambrosia first did she
8348,BOOK XIV.,"cleanse every stain from her winsome body, and anointed her with olive"
8349,BOOK XIV.,"oil, ambrosial, soft, and of a sweet savour; if it were but shaken, in"
8350,BOOK XIV.,"the bronze-floored mansion of Zeus, the savour thereof went right forth"
8351,BOOK XIV.,"to earth and heaven. Therewith she anointed her fair body, and combed"
8352,BOOK XIV.,"her hair, and with her hands plaited her shining tresses, fair and"
8353,BOOK XIV.,"ambrosial, flowing from her immortal head. Then she clad her in her"
8354,BOOK XIV.,"fragrant robe that Athene wrought delicately for her, and therein set"
8355,BOOK XIV.,"many things beautifully made, and fastened it over her breast with"
8356,BOOK XIV.,clasps of gold. And she girdled it with a girdle arrayed with a hundred
8357,BOOK XIV.,"tassels, and she set earrings in her pierced ears, earrings of three"
8358,BOOK XIV.,"drops, and glistering, therefrom shone grace abundantly. And with a"
8359,BOOK XIV.,"veil over all the peerless goddess veiled herself, a fair new veil,"
8360,BOOK XIV.,"bright as the sun, and beneath her shining feet she bound goodly"
8361,BOOK XIV.,"sandals. But when she had adorned her body with all her array, she went"
8362,BOOK XIV.,"forth from her bower, and called Aphrodite apart from the other gods,"
8363,BOOK XIV.,"and spake to her, saying: “Wilt thou obey me, dear child, in that which"
8364,BOOK XIV.,"I shall tell thee? or wilt thou refuse, with a grudge in thy heart,"
8365,BOOK XIV.,"because I succour the Danaans, and thou the Trojans?”"
8366,BOOK XIV.,
8367,BOOK XIV.,"Then Aphrodite the daughter of Zeus answered her: “Hera, goddess queen,"
8368,BOOK XIV.,"daughter of mighty Kronos, say the thing that is in thy mind, my heart"
8369,BOOK XIV.,"bids me fulfil it, if fulfil it I may, and if it may be accomplished.”"
8370,BOOK XIV.,
8371,BOOK XIV.,Then with crafty purpose the lady Hera answered her: “Give me now Love
8372,BOOK XIV.,"and Desire wherewith thou dost overcome all the Immortals, and mortal"
8373,BOOK XIV.,"men. For I am going to visit the limits of the bountiful Earth, and"
8374,BOOK XIV.,"Okeanos, father of the gods, and mother Tethys, who reared me well and"
8375,BOOK XIV.,"nourished me in their halls, having taken me from Rhea, when far-seeing"
8376,BOOK XIV.,Zeus imprisoned Kronos beneath the earth and the unvintaged sea. Them
8377,BOOK XIV.,"am I going to visit, and their endless strife will I loose, for already"
8378,BOOK XIV.,"this long time they hold apart from each other, apart from love and the"
8379,BOOK XIV.,"marriage bed, since wrath hath settled in their hearts. If with words I"
8380,BOOK XIV.,"might persuade their hearts, and bring them back to love and the"
8381,BOOK XIV.,"marriage bed, ever should I be called dear to them and worshipful.”"
8382,BOOK XIV.,
8383,BOOK XIV.,"Then laughter-loving Aphrodite answered her again: “It may not be, nor"
8384,BOOK XIV.,"seemly were it, to deny that thou askest, for thou sleepest in the arms"
8385,BOOK XIV.,"of Zeus, the chief of gods.”"
8386,BOOK XIV.,
8387,BOOK XIV.,"Therewith from her breast she loosed the broidered girdle,"
8388,BOOK XIV.,"fair-wrought, wherein are all her enchantments; therein are love, and"
8389,BOOK XIV.,"desire, and loving converse, that steals the wits even of the wise."
8390,BOOK XIV.,"This girdle she laid in her hands, and spake, and said: “Lo now, take"
8391,BOOK XIV.,"this girdle and lay it up in thy bosom, this fair-wrought girdle,"
8392,BOOK XIV.,wherein all things are fashioned; methinks thou wilt not return with
8393,BOOK XIV.,"that unaccomplished, which in thy heart thou desirest.”"
8394,BOOK XIV.,
8395,BOOK XIV.,"So spake she, and the ox-eyed lady Hera smiled, and smiling laid up the"
8396,BOOK XIV.,zone within her breast.
8397,BOOK XIV.,
8398,BOOK XIV.,"Then the daughter of Zeus, Aphrodite, went to her house, and Hera,"
8399,BOOK XIV.,"rushing down, left the peak of Olympus, and touched on Pieria and"
8400,BOOK XIV.,"pleasant Emathia, and sped’ over the snowy hills of the Thracian"
8401,BOOK XIV.,"horsemen, even over the topmost crests, nor grazed the ground with her"
8402,BOOK XIV.,"feet, and from Athos she fared across the foaming sea, and came to"
8403,BOOK XIV.,"Lemnos, the city of godlike Thoas. There she met Sleep, the brother of"
8404,BOOK XIV.,"Death, and clasped her hand in his, and spake and called him by name:"
8405,BOOK XIV.,"“Sleep, lord of all gods and of all men, if ever thou didst hear my"
8406,BOOK XIV.,"word, obey me again even now, and I will be grateful to thee always."
8407,BOOK XIV.,"Lull me, I pray thee, the shining eyes of Zeus beneath his brows, so"
8408,BOOK XIV.,soon as I have laid me down by him in love. And gifts I will give to
8409,BOOK XIV.,"thee, even a fair throne, imperishable for ever, a golden throne, that"
8410,BOOK XIV.,"Hephaistos the Lame, mine own child, shall fashion skilfully, and will"
8411,BOOK XIV.,"set beneath it a footstool for the feet, for thee to set thy shining"
8412,BOOK XIV.,"feet upon, when thou art at a festival.”"
8413,BOOK XIV.,
8414,BOOK XIV.,"Then sweet Sleep answered her and said: “Hera, goddess and queen,"
8415,BOOK XIV.,"daughter of mighty Kronos, another of the eternal gods might I lightly"
8416,BOOK XIV.,"lull to slumber, yea, were it the streams of Okeanos himself, that is"
8417,BOOK XIV.,the father of them all. But to Zeus the son of Kronos might I not draw
8418,BOOK XIV.,"near, nor lull him to slumber, unless himself commanded it. For ere now"
8419,BOOK XIV.,"did a behest of thine teach me a lesson, on the day when that famed"
8420,BOOK XIV.,"high-hearted son of Zeus sailed from Ilios, when he had sacked the city"
8421,BOOK XIV.,"of the Trojans. Then verily I lulled the soul of aegis-bearing Zeus,"
8422,BOOK XIV.,"with my sweet influence poured about him, and thou didst contrive evil"
8423,BOOK XIV.,"against him in thy heart, and didst rouse over the sea the blasts of"
8424,BOOK XIV.,"violent winds, and Herakles thou then didst bear to well-peopled Kos,"
8425,BOOK XIV.,"far from all his friends. But Zeus, when he wakened, was wrathful, and"
8426,BOOK XIV.,"dashed the gods about his mansion, and me above all he sought, and he"
8427,BOOK XIV.,"would have cast me from the upper air to perish in the deep, if Night"
8428,BOOK XIV.,"had not saved me, Night, that subdues both gods and men. To her I came"
8429,BOOK XIV.,"as a suppliant in my flight, and he ceased from pursuing, wrathful as"
8430,BOOK XIV.,"he was, for he was in awe of doing aught displeasing to swift Night."
8431,BOOK XIV.,And now again thou biddest me accomplish this other task that may not
8432,BOOK XIV.,be accomplished.”
8433,BOOK XIV.,
8434,BOOK XIV.,"Then the ox-eyed lady Hera answered him again: “Sleep, wherefore dost"
8435,BOOK XIV.,thou consider these things in thy heart? dost thou deem that Zeus of
8436,BOOK XIV.,the far-borned voice will succour the Trojans even as he was wroth for
8437,BOOK XIV.,"the sake of Herakles, his own child? Nay come, and I will give thee one"
8438,BOOK XIV.,"of the younger of the Graces, to wed and to be called thy wife [even"
8439,BOOK XIV.,"Pasithea, that ever thou longest for all thy days].”"
8440,BOOK XIV.,
8441,BOOK XIV.,"So she spake, and Sleep was glad, and answered and said: “Come now,"
8442,BOOK XIV.,"swear to me by the inviolable water of Styx, and with one of thy hands"
8443,BOOK XIV.,"grasp the bounteous earth, and with the other the shining sea, that all"
8444,BOOK XIV.,"may be witnesses to us, even all the gods below that are with Kronos,"
8445,BOOK XIV.,"that verily thou wilt give me one of the younger of the Graces, even"
8446,BOOK XIV.,"Pasithea, that myself do long for all my days.”"
8447,BOOK XIV.,
8448,BOOK XIV.,"So spake he, nor did she disobey, the white-armed goddess Hera; she"
8449,BOOK XIV.,"sware as he bade her, and called all the gods by name, even those below"
8450,BOOK XIV.,Tartaros that are called Titans. But when she had sworn and ended that
8451,BOOK XIV.,"oath, the twain left the citadel of Lemnos, and of Imbros, clothed on"
8452,BOOK XIV.,"in mist, and swiftly they accomplished the way. To many-fountained Ida"
8453,BOOK XIV.,"they came, the mother of wild beasts, to Lekton, where first they left"
8454,BOOK XIV.,"the sea, and they twain fared above the dry land, and the topmost"
8455,BOOK XIV.,"forest waved beneath their feet. There Sleep halted, ere the eyes of"
8456,BOOK XIV.,"Zeus beheld him, and alighted on a tall pine tree, the loftiest pine"
8457,BOOK XIV.,that then in all Ida rose through the nether to the upper air. Therein
8458,BOOK XIV.,"sat he, hidden by the branches of the pine, in the likeness of the"
8459,BOOK XIV.,"shrill brid that on the mountains the gods call _chalkis_, but men"
8460,BOOK XIV.,"_kymindis_.* But Hera swiftly drew nigh to topmost Gargaros, the"
8461,BOOK XIV.,"highest crest of Ida, and Zeus the cloud-gatherer beheld her. And as he"
8462,BOOK XIV.,"saw her, so love came over his deep heart, even as when first they"
8463,BOOK XIV.,"mingled with each other in delight, and went together to the couch,"
8464,BOOK XIV.,"their dear parents knowing it not. And he stood before her, and spoke,"
8465,BOOK XIV.,"and said: “Hera, with what desire comest thou thus hither from Olympus,"
8466,BOOK XIV.,"and thy horses and chariot are not here, whereon thou mightst ascend?”"
8467,BOOK XIV.,
8468,BOOK XIV.,"* The names of Night-jar, Goat-sucker, Doehawk, and Fern-owl are given"
8469,BOOK XIV.,"in Bewick for this bird, which is really a kind of swift. - R. W. R."
8470,BOOK XIV.,
8471,BOOK XIV.,
8472,BOOK XIV.,Then with crafty purpose lady Hera answered him: “I am going to visit
8473,BOOK XIV.,"the limits of the bountiful Earth, and Okeanos, father of the gods, and"
8474,BOOK XIV.,"mother Tethys, who reared me well and cherished me in their halls. Them"
8475,BOOK XIV.,"am I going to visit, and their endless strife will I loose, for already"
8476,BOOK XIV.,"this long time they hold apart from each other, from love and the"
8477,BOOK XIV.,"marriage bed, since wrath hath settled in their hearts. But my horses"
8478,BOOK XIV.,"are standing at the foot of many-fountained Ida, my horses that shall"
8479,BOOK XIV.,bear me over wet and dry. And now it is because of thee that I am thus
8480,BOOK XIV.,"come hither, down from Olympus, lest perchance thou mightest be wroth"
8481,BOOK XIV.,"with me hereafter, if silently I were gone to the mansion of"
8482,BOOK XIV.,deep-flowing Okeanos.”
8483,BOOK XIV.,
8484,BOOK XIV.,"Then Zeus, the gatherer of the clouds, answered her and said: “Hera,"
8485,BOOK XIV.,thither mayst thou go on a later day. But come let us twain take
8486,BOOK XIV.,pleasure in the bed of love. For never once as thus did the love of
8487,BOOK XIV.,goddess or woman so mightily overflow and conquer the heart within my
8488,BOOK XIV.,"breast. Not when I loved the wife of Ixion, who bore Pirithoos, the"
8489,BOOK XIV.,"peer of gods in counsel, nor when I loved Danae of the fair ankles,"
8490,BOOK XIV.,"daughter of Akrisios, who bore Perseus, most renowned of all men, nor"
8491,BOOK XIV.,"when I loved the famed daughter of Phoinix, who bore me Minos, and"
8492,BOOK XIV.,"godlike Rhadamanthys, nay, nor even when I loved Semele, nor Alkmene in"
8493,BOOK XIV.,"Thebes, and she bore Herakles, a child hardy of heart, but Semele bore"
8494,BOOK XIV.,"Dionysos, a delight to mortals, nay, nor when I loved the fair-tressed"
8495,BOOK XIV.,"queen, Demeter, nor renowned Leto, nay, nor thy very self, as now I"
8496,BOOK XIV.,"love thee, and sweet desire possesses me.”"
8497,BOOK XIV.,
8498,BOOK XIV.,And him the lady Hera answered with craft purpose: “Most dread son of
8499,BOOK XIV.,"Kronos, what a word thou hast spoken! If now thou dost long to be"
8500,BOOK XIV.,"couched in love on the crests of Ida, and all stands plain to view, how"
8501,BOOK XIV.,"would it be if someone of the eternal gods should see us slumbering,"
8502,BOOK XIV.,and go and tell it to all the gods? It is not I that could arise from
8503,BOOK XIV.,"the couch and go again to thy house, nay, it would be a thing for"
8504,BOOK XIV.,"righteous anger. But if thou wilt, and it is dear to thy heart, thou"
8505,BOOK XIV.,"hast a chamber that thine own son Hephaistos builded, and fastened"
8506,BOOK XIV.,"strong doors to the pillars, thither let us go and lie down, if the"
8507,BOOK XIV.,couch be thy desire.”
8508,BOOK XIV.,
8509,BOOK XIV.,"Then Zeus the cloud-gatherer answered her and said: “Hera, fear not"
8510,BOOK XIV.,"lest any god, or any man should spy the thing, so great a golden cloud"
8511,BOOK XIV.,"will I cast all over thee. Nay, methinks not even the sun might see"
8512,BOOK XIV.,"through it, the sun, whose light is keenest of all to behold.”"
8513,BOOK XIV.,
8514,BOOK XIV.,"So spake he, and the son of Kronos clasped his consort in his arms. And"
8515,BOOK XIV.,"beneath them the divine earth sent forth fresh new grass, and dewy"
8516,BOOK XIV.,"lotus, and crocus, and hyacinth, thick and soft, that raised them aloft"
8517,BOOK XIV.,"from the ground. Therein they lay, and were clad on with a fair golden"
8518,BOOK XIV.,"cloud, whence fell drops of glittering dew."
8519,BOOK XIV.,
8520,BOOK XIV.,"Thus slept the Father in quiet on the crest of Gargaros, by Sleep and"
8521,BOOK XIV.,"love overcome, with his bedfellow in his arms. But sweet Sleep started"
8522,BOOK XIV.,"and ran to the ships of the Achaians, to tell his tidings to the god"
8523,BOOK XIV.,"that holdeth and shaketh the earth. And he stood near him, and spake"
8524,BOOK XIV.,"winged words: “Eagerly now, Poseidon, do thou aid the Danaans, and give"
8525,BOOK XIV.,"them glory for a little space, while yet Zeus sleepeth, for over him"
8526,BOOK XIV.,"have I shed soft slumber, and Hera hath beguiled him to couch in love.”"
8527,BOOK XIV.,
8528,BOOK XIV.,"So he spake, and passed to the renowned tribes of men, and still the"
8529,BOOK XIV.,"more did he set on Poseidon to aid the Danaans, who straightway sprang"
8530,BOOK XIV.,"far afront of the foremost, and called to them: “Argives, are we again"
8531,BOOK XIV.,"to yield the victory to Hector, son of Priam, that he may take our"
8532,BOOK XIV.,"ships and win renown? Nay, even so he saith and declareth that he will"
8533,BOOK XIV.,"do, for that Achilles by the hollow ships abides angered at heart. But"
8534,BOOK XIV.,"for him there will be no such extreme regret, if we spur us on to aid"
8535,BOOK XIV.,"each the other. Nay come, as I command, let us all obey. Let us harness"
8536,BOOK XIV.,"us in the best shields that are in the host, and the greatest, and"
8537,BOOK XIV.,"cover our heads with shining helms, and take the longest spears in our"
8538,BOOK XIV.,"hands, and so go forth. Yea, and I will lead the way, and methinks that"
8539,BOOK XIV.,"Hector, son of Priam, will not long await us, for all his eagerness."
8540,BOOK XIV.,"And whatsoever man is steadfast in battle, and hath a small buckler on"
8541,BOOK XIV.,"his shoulder, let him give it to a worse man, and harness him in a"
8542,BOOK XIV.,larger shield.”
8543,BOOK XIV.,
8544,BOOK XIV.,"So spake he, and they heard him eagerly and obeyed him. And them the"
8545,BOOK XIV.,"kings themselves arrayed, wounded as they were, Tydeus’ son, and"
8546,BOOK XIV.,"Odysseus, and Agamemnon, son of Atreus. They went through all the host,"
8547,BOOK XIV.,and made exchange of weapons of war. The good arms did the good warrior
8548,BOOK XIV.,"harness him in, the worse he gave to the worse. But when they had done"
8549,BOOK XIV.,"on the shining bronze about their bodies, they started on the march,"
8550,BOOK XIV.,"and Poseidon led them, the Shaker of the earth, with a dread sword of"
8551,BOOK XIV.,"fine edge in his strong hand, like unto lightning; wherewith it is not"
8552,BOOK XIV.,"permitted that any should mingle in woful war, but fear holds men afar"
8553,BOOK XIV.,therefrom. But the Trojans on the other side was renowned Hector
8554,BOOK XIV.,"arraying. Then did they now strain the fiercest strife of war, even"
8555,BOOK XIV.,"dark-haired Poseidon and glorious Hector, one succouring the Trojans,"
8556,BOOK XIV.,the other with the Argives. And the sea washed up to the huts and ships
8557,BOOK XIV.,"of the Argives, and they gathered together with a mighty cry. Not so"
8558,BOOK XIV.,"loudly bellows the wave of the sea against the land, stirred up from"
8559,BOOK XIV.,"the deep by the harsh breath of the north wind, nor so loud is the roar"
8560,BOOK XIV.,"of burning fire in the glades of a mountain, when it springs to burn up"
8561,BOOK XIV.,"the forest, nor calls the wind so loudly in the high leafy tresses of"
8562,BOOK XIV.,"the trees, when it rages and roars its loudest, as then was the cry of"
8563,BOOK XIV.,"the Trojans and Achaians, shouting dreadfully as they rushed upon each"
8564,BOOK XIV.,other.
8565,BOOK XIV.,
8566,BOOK XIV.,"First glorious Hector cast with his spear at Aias, who was facing him"
8567,BOOK XIV.,"full, and did not miss, striking him where two belts were stretched"
8568,BOOK XIV.,"across his breast, the belt of his shield, and of his silver-studded"
8569,BOOK XIV.,sword; these guarded his tender flesh. And Hector was enraged because
8570,BOOK XIV.,"his swift spear had flown vainly from his hand, and he retreated into"
8571,BOOK XIV.,"the throng of his fellows, avoiding Fate."
8572,BOOK XIV.,
8573,BOOK XIV.,Then as he was departing the great Telamonian Aias smote him with a
8574,BOOK XIV.,"huge stone; for many stones, the props of swift ships, were rolled"
8575,BOOK XIV.,"among the feet of the fighters; one of these he lifted, and smote"
8576,BOOK XIV.,"Hector on the breast, over the shield-rim, near the neck, and made him"
8577,BOOK XIV.,"spin like a top with the blow, that he reeled round and round. And even"
8578,BOOK XIV.,"as when an oak falls uprooted beneath the stroke of father Zeus, and a"
8579,BOOK XIV.,"dread savour of brimstone arises therefrom, and whoso stands near and"
8580,BOOK XIV.,"beholds it has no more courage, for dread is the bolt of great Zeus,"
8581,BOOK XIV.,even so fell mighty Hector straightway in the dust. And the spear fell
8582,BOOK XIV.,"from his hand, but his shield and helm were made fast to him, and round"
8583,BOOK XIV.,him rang his arms adorned with bronze.
8584,BOOK XIV.,
8585,BOOK XIV.,"Then with a loud cry they ran up, the sons of the Achaians, hoping to"
8586,BOOK XIV.,"drag him away, and they cast showers of darts. But not one availed to"
8587,BOOK XIV.,"wound or smite the shepherd of the host, before that might be the"
8588,BOOK XIV.,"bravest gathered about him, Polydamas, and Aineias, and goodly Agenor,"
8589,BOOK XIV.,"and Sarpedon, leader of the Lykians, and noble Glaukos, and of the rest"
8590,BOOK XIV.,"not one was heedless of him, but they held their round shields in front"
8591,BOOK XIV.,"of him, and his comrades lifted him in their arms, and bare him out of"
8592,BOOK XIV.,"the battle, till he reached his swift horses that were standing waiting"
8593,BOOK XIV.,"for him, with the charioteer and the fair-dight chariot at the rear of"
8594,BOOK XIV.,the combat and the war. These toward the city bore him heavily moaning.
8595,BOOK XIV.,"Now when they came to the ford of the fair-flowing river, of eddying"
8596,BOOK XIV.,"Xanthos, that immortal Zeus begat, there they lifted him from the"
8597,BOOK XIV.,"chariot to the ground, and poured water over him, and he gat back his"
8598,BOOK XIV.,"breath, and looked up with his eyes, and sitting on his heels kneeling,"
8599,BOOK XIV.,"he vomited black blood. Then again he sank back on the ground, and"
8600,BOOK XIV.,"black night covered his eyes, the stroke still conquering his spirit."
8601,BOOK XIV.,
8602,BOOK XIV.,Now the Argives when they saw Hector departed rushed yet the more upon
8603,BOOK XIV.,"the Trojans, and were mindful of the delight of battle. There far the"
8604,BOOK XIV.,"foremost did swift Aias, son of Oileus, leap on Satnios, son of Enops,"
8605,BOOK XIV.,and wounded him with his sharp spear; Satnios whom the fair Naiad-nymph
8606,BOOK XIV.,bore to Enops as he herded his flocks by the banks of Satnioeis. Him
8607,BOOK XIV.,"did the spear-famed son of Oileus draw nigh, and wounded him on the"
8608,BOOK XIV.,"flank, and he fell, and round him did Trojans and Danaans join in"
8609,BOOK XIV.,"strong battle. Then to his aid came Polydamas, the wielder of the"
8610,BOOK XIV.,"spear, son of Panthoos, and smote Prothoenor on the right shoulder,"
8611,BOOK XIV.,"Prothoenor, son of Areïlykos, and through his shoulder went the mighty"
8612,BOOK XIV.,"spear, and he fell in the dust, and clutched the earth with his palm."
8613,BOOK XIV.,"And Polydamas boasted over him terribly, crying aloud: “Verily methinks"
8614,BOOK XIV.,"that again from the strong hand of the high-hearted son of Panthoos,"
8615,BOOK XIV.,"the spear hath not leaped in vain. Nay, one of the Argives hath caught"
8616,BOOK XIV.,"it in his flesh, and leaning thereon for a staff, methinks that he will"
8617,BOOK XIV.,go down within the house of Hades.”
8618,BOOK XIV.,
8619,BOOK XIV.,"So spake he, and sorrow came on the Argives by reason of his boasting."
8620,BOOK XIV.,"And chiefly he roused the wrath of the wise son of Telamon, Aias, for"
8621,BOOK XIV.,"the man fell close by him. Swiftly he cast at the other, as he"
8622,BOOK XIV.,"departed, with his shining spear. And Polydamas himself avoided black"
8623,BOOK XIV.,"Fate, starting to one side, but Archelochos, son of Antenor, received"
8624,BOOK XIV.,"the spear, for the gods had willed his death. Him the spear struck at"
8625,BOOK XIV.,"the meeting of the head and neck, on the last joint of the spine, and"
8626,BOOK XIV.,"cut in twain both the tendons. And his head, and mouth, and nose, as he"
8627,BOOK XIV.,"fell, reached the earth long before his legs and knees, and Aias again"
8628,BOOK XIV.,"shouted to noble Polydamas: “Consider, Polydamas, and tell me truly,"
8629,BOOK XIV.,whether thou sayst not that this man is worth slaying in place of
8630,BOOK XIV.,"Prothoenor: he seems to me no coward, nor born of cowards, but a"
8631,BOOK XIV.,"brother of horse-taming Antenor, or a child, for he most closely"
8632,BOOK XIV.,favoureth his house.”
8633,BOOK XIV.,
8634,BOOK XIV.,"So he spake, knowing the truth right well, and sorrow seized the hearts"
8635,BOOK XIV.,of the Trojans. Then Akamas wounded Promachos the Boiotian with his
8636,BOOK XIV.,"spear, from where he stodd above his brother, that Promachos was"
8637,BOOK XIV.,"dragging away by the feet. Over him Akamas boasted terribly, shouting"
8638,BOOK XIV.,"aloud: “Ye Argive bowmen, insatiate of threats, verily not for us alone"
8639,BOOK XIV.,"shall there be struggle and toil, nay, but even as we shall ye likewise"
8640,BOOK XIV.,"perish. Consider how your Promachos sleepeth, vanquished by my spear,"
8641,BOOK XIV.,that my brother's blood-price may not be long unpaid. Even for this it
8642,BOOK XIV.,"is that a man may well pray to leave some kinsman in his halls, that"
8643,BOOK XIV.,will avenge his fall.”
8644,BOOK XIV.,
8645,BOOK XIV.,"So he spake, and sorrow came on the Argives at his boast. And chiefly"
8646,BOOK XIV.,"he stirred the heart of the wise Peneleos, who made for Akamas, and"
8647,BOOK XIV.,Akamas abode not the onset of the prince Peneleos. But Peneleos wounded
8648,BOOK XIV.,"Ilioneus, the son of Phorbas, rich in herds, that Hermes loved most"
8649,BOOK XIV.,"dearly of all the Trojans, and gave him wealth. Now his mother bare"
8650,BOOK XIV.,"Ilioneus, an only child, to Phorbas. Him did Peneleos wound beneath the"
8651,BOOK XIV.,"brows, at the bases of the eye, and drave out the eyeball, and the"
8652,BOOK XIV.,"spear went clean through the eye and through the nape of the neck, and"
8653,BOOK XIV.,"he fell back, stretching out both his hands. And Peneleos, drawing"
8654,BOOK XIV.,"forth his sharp sword, smote him on the middle of the neck, and smote"
8655,BOOK XIV.,"off even to the ground the head with the helmet, and still the strong"
8656,BOOK XIV.,"spear stood in the eye, and lifting it up like a poppy head, he showed"
8657,BOOK XIV.,"it to the Trojans, and spoke his boastful words: “Ye Trojans, I pray"
8658,BOOK XIV.,you bid the dear father and the mother of proud Ilioneus to wail in
8659,BOOK XIV.,"their halls, for neither will the wife of Promachos, son of Alegenor,"
8660,BOOK XIV.,"rejoice in her dear husband's coming, in that hour when we youths of"
8661,BOOK XIV.,the Achaians return with our ships out of Troy-land.”
8662,BOOK XIV.,
8663,BOOK XIV.,"So he spake, and fear fell on the limbs of all of them; and each man"
8664,BOOK XIV.,looked about to see where he might flee sheer destruction.
8665,BOOK XIV.,
8666,BOOK XIV.,"Tell me now, ye Muses, that dwell in the mansions of Olympus, who was"
8667,BOOK XIV.,"the first of the Achaians to lift the bloody spoils, when once the"
8668,BOOK XIV.,renowned Shaker of the earth turned the battle.
8669,BOOK XIV.,
8670,BOOK XIV.,"Verily it was Aias, son of Telamon, that first wounded Hyrtios, the son"
8671,BOOK XIV.,"of Gyrtias, the leader of the Mysians strong of heart, and Antilochos"
8672,BOOK XIV.,"stripped the spoils from Phalkes and Mermeros, and Meriones slew Morys"
8673,BOOK XIV.,"and Hippotion, and Teukros slew Prothoon and Periphetes, and next"
8674,BOOK XIV.,"Atreus' son wounded in the flank Hyperenor, the shepherd of the host,"
8675,BOOK XIV.,"and the bronze point tore through and let out the entrails, and the"
8676,BOOK XIV.,"soul through the stricken wound fled hastily, and darkness covered his"
8677,BOOK XIV.,"eyes. But most men did Aias slay, the swift-footed son of Oileus, for"
8678,BOOK XIV.,"there was none so speedy of foot as he, to follow when men fled, when"
8679,BOOK XIV.,Zeus sent terror among them.
8680,BOOK XIV.,
8681,BOOK XIV.,
8682,BOOK XIV.,
8683,BOOK XIV.,
8684,BOOK XV.,BOOK XV.
8685,BOOK XV.,
8686,BOOK XV.,
8687,BOOK XV.,"Zeus awakening, biddeth Apollo revive Hector, and restore the fortunes"
8688,BOOK XV.,of the Trojans. Fire is thrown on the ship of Protesilaos.
8689,BOOK XV.,
8690,BOOK XV.,
8691,BOOK XV.,"Now when they had sped in flight across the palisade and trench, and"
8692,BOOK XV.,"many were overcome at the hands of the Danaans, the rest were stayed,"
8693,BOOK XV.,"and abode beside the chariots in confusion, and pale with terror, and"
8694,BOOK XV.,"Zeus awoke, on the peaks of Ida, beside Hera of the golden throne. Then"
8695,BOOK XV.,"he leaped up, and stood, and beheld the Trojans and Achaians, those in"
8696,BOOK XV.,"flight, and these driving them on from the rear, even the Argives, and"
8697,BOOK XV.,"among them the prince Poseidon. And Hector he saw lying on the plain,"
8698,BOOK XV.,"and around him sat his comrades, and he was gasping with difficult"
8699,BOOK XV.,"breath, and his mind wandering, and was vomiting blood, for it was not"
8700,BOOK XV.,"the weakest of the Achaians that had smitten him. Beholding him, the"
8701,BOOK XV.,"father of men and gods had pity on him, and terribly he spoke to Hera,"
8702,BOOK XV.,"with fierce look: “O thou ill to deal with, Hera, verily it is thy"
8703,BOOK XV.,"crafty wile that has made noble Hector cease from the fight, and has"
8704,BOOK XV.,"terrified the host. Nay, but yet I know not whether thou mayst not be"
8705,BOOK XV.,"the first to reap the fruits of thy cruel treason, and I beat thee with"
8706,BOOK XV.,"stripes. Dost thou not remember, when thou wert hung from on high, and"
8707,BOOK XV.,"from thy feet I suspended two anvils, and round thy hands fastened a"
8708,BOOK XV.,golden bond that might not be broken? And thou didst hang in the clear
8709,BOOK XV.,"air and the clouds, and the gods were wroth in high Olympus, but they"
8710,BOOK XV.,could not come round and unloose thee.”
8711,BOOK XV.,
8712,BOOK XV.,"So spake he, and the ox-eyed lady Hera shuddered, and spake unto him"
8713,BOOK XV.,"winged words, saying: “Let earth now be witness hereto, and wide heaven"
8714,BOOK XV.,"above, and that falling water of Styx, the greatest oath and the most"
8715,BOOK XV.,"terrible to the blessed gods, and thine own sacred head, and our own"
8716,BOOK XV.,"bridal bed, whereby never would I forswear myself, that not by my will"
8717,BOOK XV.,"does earth-shaking Poseidon trouble the Trojans and Hector, and succour"
8718,BOOK XV.,"them of the other part. Nay, it is his own soul that urgeth and"
8719,BOOK XV.,"commandeth him, and he had pity on the Achaians, when he beheld them"
8720,BOOK XV.,hard pressed beside the ships. I would even counsel him also to go even
8721,BOOK XV.,"where thou, lord of the storm-cloud, mayst lead him.”"
8722,BOOK XV.,
8723,BOOK XV.,"So spake she, and the father of gods and men smiled, and answering her"
8724,BOOK XV.,"he spake winged words: “If thou, of a truth, O ox-eyed lady Hera,"
8725,BOOK XV.,"wouldst hereafter abide of one mind with me among the immortal gods,"
8726,BOOK XV.,"thereon would Poseidon, howsoever much his wish be contrariwise,"
8727,BOOK XV.,"quickly turn his mind otherwhere, after thy heart and mine. But if"
8728,BOOK XV.,"indeed thou speakest the truth and soothly, go thou now among the"
8729,BOOK XV.,"tribes of the gods, and call Iris to come hither, and Apollo, the"
8730,BOOK XV.,"renowned archer, that Iris may go among the host of mail-clad Achaians"
8731,BOOK XV.,"and tell Poseidon the prince to cease from the war, and get him unto"
8732,BOOK XV.,"his own house. But let Phoebus Apollo spur Hector on to the war, and"
8733,BOOK XV.,"breathe strength into him again, and make him forget his anguish, that"
8734,BOOK XV.,"now wears down his heart, and drive the Achaians back again, when he"
8735,BOOK XV.,hath stirred in them craven fear. Let them flee and fall among the
8736,BOOK XV.,"many-benched ships of Achilles son of Peleus, and he shall rouse his"
8737,BOOK XV.,"own comrade, Patroklos; and him shall renowned Hector slay with the"
8738,BOOK XV.,"spear, in front of Ilios, after that he has slain many other youths,"
8739,BOOK XV.,"and among them my son, noble Sarpedon. In wrath therefor shall goodly"
8740,BOOK XV.,Achilles slay Hector. From that hour verily will I cause a new pursuit
8741,BOOK XV.,"from the ships, that shall endure continually, even until the Achaians"
8742,BOOK XV.,"take steep Ilios, through the counsels of Athene. But before that hour"
8743,BOOK XV.,"neither do I cease in my wrath, nor will I suffer any other of the"
8744,BOOK XV.,"Immortals to help the Danaans there, before I accomplish that desire of"
8745,BOOK XV.,"the son of Peleus, as I promised him at the first, and confirmed the"
8746,BOOK XV.,"same with a nod of my head, on that day when the goddess Thetis clasped"
8747,BOOK XV.,"my knees, imploring me to honour Achilles, the sacker of cities.”"
8748,BOOK XV.,
8749,BOOK XV.,"So spake he, nor did the white-armed goddess Hera disobey him, and she"
8750,BOOK XV.,"sped down from the hills of Ida to high Olympus, and went among the"
8751,BOOK XV.,gathering of the immortal gods. And she called Apollo without the hall
8752,BOOK XV.,"and Iris, that is the messenger of the immortal gods, and she spake"
8753,BOOK XV.,"winged words, and addressed them, saying: “Zeus bids you go to Ida as"
8754,BOOK XV.,"swiftly as may be, and when ye have gone, and looked on the face of"
8755,BOOK XV.,"Zeus, do ye whatsoever he shall order and command.”"
8756,BOOK XV.,
8757,BOOK XV.,"And these twain came before the face of Zeus the cloud gatherer, and"
8758,BOOK XV.,"stood there, and he was nowise displeased at heart when he beheld them,"
8759,BOOK XV.,for that speedily they had obeyed the words of his dear wife. And to
8760,BOOK XV.,"Iris first he spake winged words: “Go, get thee, swift Iris, to the"
8761,BOOK XV.,"prince Poseidon, and tell him all these things, nor be a false"
8762,BOOK XV.,"messenger. Command him to cease from war and battle, and to go among"
8763,BOOK XV.,"the tribes of the gods, or into the bright sea. But if he will not obey"
8764,BOOK XV.,"my words, but will hold me in no regard, then let him consider in his"
8765,BOOK XV.,"heart and mind, lest he dare not for all his strength to abide me when"
8766,BOOK XV.,"I come against him, since I deem me to be far mightier than he, and"
8767,BOOK XV.,elder born.”
8768,BOOK XV.,
8769,BOOK XV.,"So spake he, nor did the wind-footed fleet Iris disobey him, but went"
8770,BOOK XV.,down the hills of Ida to sacred Ilios. And as when snow or chill hail
8771,BOOK XV.,fleets from the clouds beneath the stress of the North Wind born in the
8772,BOOK XV.,"clear air, so fleetly she fled in her eagerness, swift Iris, and drew"
8773,BOOK XV.,near the renowned Earth-shaker and spake to him the message of Zeus.
8774,BOOK XV.,"And he left the host of the Achaians, and passed to the sea, and sank,"
8775,BOOK XV.,"and sorely they missed him, the heroes of the Achaians."
8776,BOOK XV.,
8777,BOOK XV.,"Then Zeus, the gatherer of the clouds, spake to Apollo, saying: “Go"
8778,BOOK XV.,"now, dear Phoebus, to Hector of the helm of bronze. Let glorious Hector"
8779,BOOK XV.,"be thy care, and rouse in him great wrath even till the Achaians come"
8780,BOOK XV.,"in their flight to the ships, and the Hellespont. And from that moment"
8781,BOOK XV.,will I devise word and deed wherewithal the Achaians may take breath
8782,BOOK XV.,again from their toil.”
8783,BOOK XV.,
8784,BOOK XV.,"So spake he, nor was Apollo deaf to the word of the Father, but he went"
8785,BOOK XV.,"down the hills of Ida like a fleet falcon, the bane of doves, that is"
8786,BOOK XV.,the swiftest of flying things. And he found the son of wise-hearted
8787,BOOK XV.,"Priam, noble Hector, sitting up, no longer lying, for he had but late"
8788,BOOK XV.,"got back his life, and knew the comrades around him, and his gasping"
8789,BOOK XV.,"and his sweat had ceased, from the moment when the will of"
8790,BOOK XV.,aegis-bearing Zeus began to revive him. Then far-darting Apollo stood
8791,BOOK XV.,"near him, and spake to him: “Hector, son of Priam, why dost thou sit"
8792,BOOK XV.,fainting apart from the others? Is it perchance that some trouble
8793,BOOK XV.,cometh upon thee?”
8794,BOOK XV.,
8795,BOOK XV.,"Then, with faint breath answered him Hector of the glancing helm: “Nay,"
8796,BOOK XV.,"but who art thou, best of the gods, who enquirest of me face to face?"
8797,BOOK XV.,Dost thou not know that by the hindmost row of the ships of the
8798,BOOK XV.,"Achaians, Aias of the loud war-cry smote me on the breast with a stone,"
8799,BOOK XV.,"as I was slaying his comrades, and made me cease from mine impetuous"
8800,BOOK XV.,might? And verily I deemed that this very day I should pass to the
8801,BOOK XV.,"dead, and the house of Hades, when I had gasped my life away.”"
8802,BOOK XV.,
8803,BOOK XV.,Then prince Apollo the Far-darter answered him again: “Take courage
8804,BOOK XV.,"now, so great an ally hath the son of Kronos sent thee out of Ida, to"
8805,BOOK XV.,"stand by thee and defend thee, even Phoebus Apollo of the golden sword,"
8806,BOOK XV.,"me who of old defend thee, thyself and the steep citadel. But come now,"
8807,BOOK XV.,bid thy many charioteers drive their swift steeds against the hollow
8808,BOOK XV.,"ships, and I will go before and make smooth all the way for the"
8809,BOOK XV.,"chariots, and will put to flight the Achaian heroes.”"
8810,BOOK XV.,
8811,BOOK XV.,"So he spake, and breathed great might into the shepherd of the host,"
8812,BOOK XV.,"and even as when a stalled horse, full fed at the manger, breaks his"
8813,BOOK XV.,"tether and speedeth at the gallop over the plain exultingly, being wont"
8814,BOOK XV.,"to bathe in the fair-flowing stream, and holds his head on high, and"
8815,BOOK XV.,"the mane floweth about his shoulders, and he trusteth in his glory, and"
8816,BOOK XV.,"nimbly his knees bear him to the haunts and pasture of the mares, even"
8817,BOOK XV.,"so Hector lightly moved his feet and knees, urging on his horsemen,"
8818,BOOK XV.,when he heard the voice of the god. But as when hounds and country folk
8819,BOOK XV.,"pursue a horned stag, or a wild goat, that steep rock and shady wood"
8820,BOOK XV.,"save from them, nor is it their lot to find him, but at their clamour a"
8821,BOOK XV.,"bearded lion hath shown himself on the way, and lightly turned them all"
8822,BOOK XV.,"despite their eagerness, even so the Danaans for a while followed on"
8823,BOOK XV.,"always in their companies, smiting with swords and double-pointed"
8824,BOOK XV.,"spears, but when they saw Hector going up and down the ranks of men,"
8825,BOOK XV.,"then were they afraid, and the hearts of all fell to their feet."
8826,BOOK XV.,
8827,BOOK XV.,"Then to them spake Thoas, son of Andraimon, far the best of the"
8828,BOOK XV.,"Aitolians, skilled in throwing the dart, and good in close fight, and"
8829,BOOK XV.,"in council did few of the Achaians surpass him, when the young men were"
8830,BOOK XV.,"striving in debate; he made harangue and spake among them: “Alas, and"
8831,BOOK XV.,"verily a great marvel is this I behold with mine eyes, how he hath"
8832,BOOK XV.,"again arisen, and hath avoided the Fates, even Hector. Surely each of"
8833,BOOK XV.,"us hoped in his heart, that he had died beneath the hand of Aias, son"
8834,BOOK XV.,of Telamon. But some one of the gods again hath delivered and saved
8835,BOOK XV.,"Hector, who verily hath loosened the knees of many of the Danaans, as"
8836,BOOK XV.,"methinks will befall even now, for not without the will of"
8837,BOOK XV.,"loud-thundering Zeus doth he rise in the front ranks, thus eager for"
8838,BOOK XV.,"battle. But come, as I declare let us all obey. Let us bid the throng"
8839,BOOK XV.,"turn back to the ships, but let us as many as avow us to be the best in"
8840,BOOK XV.,"the host, take our stand, if perchance first we may meet him, and hold"
8841,BOOK XV.,"him off with outstretched spears, and he, methinks, for all his"
8842,BOOK XV.,"eagerness, will fear at heart to enter into the press of the Danaans.”"
8843,BOOK XV.,
8844,BOOK XV.,"So spake he, and they heard him eagerly, and obeyed him. They that were"
8845,BOOK XV.,"with Aias and the prince Idomeneus, and Teukros, and Neriones, and"
8846,BOOK XV.,"Meges the peer of Ares, called to all the best of the warriors and"
8847,BOOK XV.,"sustained the fight with Hector and the Trojans, but behind them the"
8848,BOOK XV.,multitude returned to the ships of the Achaians.
8849,BOOK XV.,
8850,BOOK XV.,"Now the Trojans drave forward in close ranks, and with long strides"
8851,BOOK XV.,"Hector led them, while in front of him went Phoebus Apollo, his"
8852,BOOK XV.,"shoulders wrapped in cloud, and still he held the fell aegis, dread,"
8853,BOOK XV.,"circled with a shaggy fringe, and gleaming, that Hephaistos the smith"
8854,BOOK XV.,"gave to Zeus, to bear for the terror of men; with this in his hands did"
8855,BOOK XV.,he lead the host.
8856,BOOK XV.,
8857,BOOK XV.,"Now the Argives abode them in close ranks, and shrill the cry arose on"
8858,BOOK XV.,"both sides, and the arrows leaped from the bow-strings, and many spears"
8859,BOOK XV.,"from stalwart hands, whereof some stood fast in the flesh of young men"
8860,BOOK XV.,"swift in fight, but many halfway, ere ever they reached the white"
8861,BOOK XV.,"flesh, stuck in the ground, longing to glut themselves with flesh. Now"
8862,BOOK XV.,"so long as Phoebus Apollo held the aegis unmoved in his hands, so long"
8863,BOOK XV.,"the darts smote either side amain, and the folk fell. But when he"
8864,BOOK XV.,"looked face to face on the Danaans of the swift steeds, and shook the"
8865,BOOK XV.,"aegis, and himself shouted mightily, he quelled their heart in their"
8866,BOOK XV.,"breast, and they forgot their impetuous valour. And as when two wild"
8867,BOOK XV.,"beasts drive in confusion a herd of kine, or a great flock of sheep, in"
8868,BOOK XV.,"the dark hour of black night, coming swiftly on them when the herdsman"
8869,BOOK XV.,"is not by, even so were the Achaians terror-stricken and strengthless,"
8870,BOOK XV.,"for Apollo sent a panic among them, but still gave renown to the"
8871,BOOK XV.,Trojans and Hector.
8872,BOOK XV.,
8873,BOOK XV.,"And Hector smote his horses on the shoulder with the lash, and called"
8874,BOOK XV.,"aloud on the Trojans along the ranks. And they all cried out, and level"
8875,BOOK XV.,"with his held the steeds that drew their chariots, with a marvellous"
8876,BOOK XV.,"din, and in front of them Phoebus Apollo lightly dashed down with his"
8877,BOOK XV.,"feet the banks of the deep ditch, and cast them into the midst thereof,"
8878,BOOK XV.,"making a bridgeway long and wide as is a spear-cast, when a man throws"
8879,BOOK XV.,to make trial of his strength. Thereby the Trojans poured forward in
8880,BOOK XV.,"their battalions, while in their van Apollo held the splendid aegis."
8881,BOOK XV.,"And most easily did he cast down the wall of the Achaians, as when a"
8882,BOOK XV.,"boy scatters the sand beside the sea, first making sand buildings for"
8883,BOOK XV.,"sport in his childishness, and then again, in his sport, confounding"
8884,BOOK XV.,"them with his feet and hands; even so didst thou, archer Apollo,"
8885,BOOK XV.,"confound the long toil and labour of the Argives, and among them rouse"
8886,BOOK XV.,a panic fear.
8887,BOOK XV.,
8888,BOOK XV.,"So they were halting, and abiding by the ships, calling each to other;"
8889,BOOK XV.,"and lifting their hands to all the gods did each man pray vehemently,"
8890,BOOK XV.,"and chiefly prayed Nestor, the Warden of the Achaians, stretching his"
8891,BOOK XV.,"hand towards the starry heaven: “O father Zeus, if ever any one of us"
8892,BOOK XV.,"in wheat-bearing Argos did burn to thee fat thighs of bull or sheep,"
8893,BOOK XV.,"and prayed that he might return, and thou didst promise and assent"
8894,BOOK XV.,"thereto, of these things be thou mindful, and avert, Olympian, the"
8895,BOOK XV.,"pitiless day, nor suffer the Trojans thus to overcome the Achaians.”"
8896,BOOK XV.,
8897,BOOK XV.,"So spake he in his prayer, and Zeus, the Lord of counsel, thundered"
8898,BOOK XV.,"loudly, hearing the prayers of the ancient son of Neleus."
8899,BOOK XV.,
8900,BOOK XV.,"But the Trojans when they heard the thunder of aegis-bearing Zeus,"
8901,BOOK XV.,"rushed yet the more eagerly upon the Argives, and were mindful of the"
8902,BOOK XV.,joy of battle. And as when a great wave of the wide sea sweeps over the
8903,BOOK XV.,"bulwarks of a ship, the might of the wind constraining it, which"
8904,BOOK XV.,"chiefly swells the waves, even so did the Trojans with a great cry"
8905,BOOK XV.,"bound over the wall, and drave their horses on, and at the hindmost row"
8906,BOOK XV.,"of the ships were fighting hand to hand with double-pointed spears, the"
8907,BOOK XV.,"Trojans from the chariots, but the Achaians climbing up aloft, from the"
8908,BOOK XV.,black ships with long pikes that they had lying in the ships for battle
8909,BOOK XV.,"at sea, jointed pikes shod at the head with bronze."
8910,BOOK XV.,
8911,BOOK XV.,"Now the Trojans, like ravening lions, rushed upon the ships, fulfilling"
8912,BOOK XV.,"the behests of Zeus, that ever was rousing their great wrath, but"
8913,BOOK XV.,"softened the temper of the Argives, and took away their glory, while he"
8914,BOOK XV.,spurred on the others. For the heart of Zeus was set on giving glory to
8915,BOOK XV.,"Hector, the son of Priam, that withal he might cast fierce-blazing"
8916,BOOK XV.,"fire, unwearied, upon the beaked ships, and so fulfil all the"
8917,BOOK XV.,"presumptuous prayer of Thetis; wherefore wise-counselling Zeus awaited,"
8918,BOOK XV.,till his eyes should see the glare of a burning ship. For even from
8919,BOOK XV.,that hour was he to ordain the backward chase of the Trojans from the
8920,BOOK XV.,"ships, and to give glory to the Danaans. With this design was he"
8921,BOOK XV.,"rousing Hector, Priam’s son, that himself was right eager, against the"
8922,BOOK XV.,"hollow ships. For short of life was he to be, yea, and already Pallas"
8923,BOOK XV.,"Athene was urging against him the day of destiny, at the hand of the"
8924,BOOK XV.,"son of Peleus. And fain he was to break the ranks of men, trying them"
8925,BOOK XV.,"wheresoever he saw the thickest press, and the goodliest harness. Yet"
8926,BOOK XV.,"not even so might he break them for all his eagerness. Nay, they stood"
8927,BOOK XV.,"firm, and embattled like a steep rock and a great, hard by the hoary"
8928,BOOK XV.,"sea, a rock that abides the swift paths of the shrill winds, and the"
8929,BOOK XV.,swelling waves that roar against it. Even so the Danaans steadfastly
8930,BOOK XV.,abode the Trojans and fled not away. But Hector shining with fire on
8931,BOOK XV.,"all sides leaped on the throng, and fell upon them, as when beneath the"
8932,BOOK XV.,"storm-clouds a fleet wave reared of the winds falls on a swift ship,"
8933,BOOK XV.,"and she is all hidden with foam, and the dread blast of the wind roars"
8934,BOOK XV.,"against the sail, and the sailors fear, and tremble in their hearts,"
8935,BOOK XV.,"for by but a little way are they borne forth from death, even so the"
8936,BOOK XV.,spirit was torn in the breasts of the Achaians.
8937,BOOK XV.,
8938,BOOK XV.,So again keen battle was set by the ships. Thou wouldst deem that
8939,BOOK XV.,"unwearied and unworn they met each other in war, so eagerly they"
8940,BOOK XV.,fought. And in their striving they were minded thus; the Achaians
8941,BOOK XV.,"verily deemed that never would they flee from the danger, but perish"
8942,BOOK XV.,"there, but the heart of each Trojan hoped in his breast, that they"
8943,BOOK XV.,"should fire the ships, and slay the heroes of the Achaians. With these"
8944,BOOK XV.,"imaginations they stood to each other, and Hector seized the stern of a"
8945,BOOK XV.,"seafaring ship, a fair ship, swift on the brine, that had borne"
8946,BOOK XV.,"Protesilaos to Troia, but brought him not back again to his own"
8947,BOOK XV.,country. Now round his ship the Achaians and Trojans warred on each
8948,BOOK XV.,"other hand to hand, nor far apart did they endure the flights of"
8949,BOOK XV.,"arrows, nor of darts, but standing hard each by other, with one heart,"
8950,BOOK XV.,"with sharp axes and hatchets they fought, and with great swords, and"
8951,BOOK XV.,"double-pointed spears. And many fair brands, dark-scabbarded and"
8952,BOOK XV.,"hilted, fell to the ground, some from the hands, some from off the"
8953,BOOK XV.,"shoulders of warring men, and the black earth ran with blood. But"
8954,BOOK XV.,"Hector, after that once he had seized the ship’s stern, left not his"
8955,BOOK XV.,"hold, keeping the ensign in his hands, and he called to the Trojans:"
8956,BOOK XV.,"“Bring fire, and all with one voice do ye raise the war-cry; now hath"
8957,BOOK XV.,"Zeus given us the dearest day of all,—to take the ships that came"
8958,BOOK XV.,"hither against the will of the gods, and brought many woes upon us, by"
8959,BOOK XV.,"the cowardice of the elders, who withheld me when I was eager to fight"
8960,BOOK XV.,"at the sterns of the ships, and kept back the host. But if even then"
8961,BOOK XV.,"far-seeing Zeus did harm our wits, now he himself doth urge and command"
8962,BOOK XV.,"us onwards.” So spake he, and they set yet the fiercer on the Argives."
8963,BOOK XV.,"And Aias no longer abode their onset, for he was driven back by the"
8964,BOOK XV.,"darts, but he withdrew a little,—thinking that now he should die,—on to"
8965,BOOK XV.,"the oarsman’s bench of seven feet long, and he left the decks of the"
8966,BOOK XV.,"trim ship. There then he stood on the watch, and with his spear he ever"
8967,BOOK XV.,"drave the Trojans from the ships, whosoever brought unwearied fire, and"
8968,BOOK XV.,"ever he shouted terribly, calling to the Danaans: “O friends, Danaan"
8969,BOOK XV.,"heroes, men of Ares’ company, play the man, my friends, and be mindful"
8970,BOOK XV.,"of impetuous valour. Do we deem that there be allies at our backs, or"
8971,BOOK XV.,some wall stronger than this to ward off death from men? Verily there
8972,BOOK XV.,"is not hard by any city arrayed with towers, whereby we might defend"
8973,BOOK XV.,"ourselves, having a host that could turn the balance of battle. Nay,"
8974,BOOK XV.,"but we are set down in the plain of the mailed men of Troy, with our"
8975,BOOK XV.,"backs against the sea, and far off from our own land. Therefore is"
8976,BOOK XV.,"safety in battle, and not in slackening from the fight.” So spake he,"
8977,BOOK XV.,"and rushed on ravening for battle, with his keen spear. And whosoever"
8978,BOOK XV.,"of the Trojans was coming against the ship with blazing fire, to"
8979,BOOK XV.,"pleasure Hector at his urging, him would Aias wound, awaiting him with"
8980,BOOK XV.,"his long spear, and twelve men in front of the ships at close quarters"
8981,BOOK XV.,did he wound.
8982,BOOK XV.,
8983,BOOK XV.,
8984,BOOK XV.,
8985,BOOK XV.,
8986,BOOK XVI.,BOOK XVI.
8987,BOOK XVI.,
8988,BOOK XVI.,
8989,BOOK XVI.,"How Patroklos fought in the armour of Achilles, and drove the Trojans"
8990,BOOK XVI.,"from the ships, but was slain at last by Hector."
8991,BOOK XVI.,
8992,BOOK XVI.,
8993,BOOK XVI.,"So they were warring round the well-timbered ship, but Patroklos drew"
8994,BOOK XVI.,"near Achilles, shepherd of the host, and he shed warm tears, even as a"
8995,BOOK XVI.,fountain of dark water that down a steep cliff pours its cloudy stream.
8996,BOOK XVI.,And noble swift-footed Achilles when he beheld him was grieved for his
8997,BOOK XVI.,"sake, and accosted him, and spake winged words, saying: “Wherefore"
8998,BOOK XVI.,"weepest thou, Patroklos, like a fond little maid, that runs by her"
8999,BOOK XVI.,"mother’s side, and bids her mother take her up, snatching at her gown,"
9000,BOOK XVI.,"and hinders her in her going, and tearfully looks at her, till the"
9001,BOOK XVI.,"mother takes her up? like her, Patroklos, dost thou let fall soft"
9002,BOOK XVI.,"tears. Hast thou aught to tell to the Myrmidons, or to me myself, or is"
9003,BOOK XVI.,it some tidings out of Phthia that thou alone hast beard? Or dost thou
9004,BOOK XVI.,"lament for the sake of the Argives,—how they perish by the hollow ships"
9005,BOOK XVI.,"through their own transgression? Speak out, and hide it not within thy"
9006,BOOK XVI.,"spirit, that we may both know all.”"
9007,BOOK XVI.,
9008,BOOK XVI.,"But with a heavy groan didst thou speak unto him, O knight Patroklos:"
9009,BOOK XVI.,"“O Achilles, son of Peleus, far the bravest of the Achaians, be not"
9010,BOOK XVI.,"wroth, seeing that so great calamity has beset the Achaians. For verily"
9011,BOOK XVI.,"all of them that aforetime were the best are lying among the ships,"
9012,BOOK XVI.,"smitten and wounded. Smitten is the son of Tydeus, strong Diomedes, and"
9013,BOOK XVI.,"wounded is Odysseus, spearman renowned, and Agamemnon; and smitten is"
9014,BOOK XVI.,Eurypylos on the thigh with an arrow. And about them the leeches
9015,BOOK XVI.,"skilled in medicines are busy, healing their wounds, but thou art hard"
9016,BOOK XVI.,"to reconcile, Achilles. Never then may such wrath take hold of me as"
9017,BOOK XVI.,that thou nursest; thou brave to the hurting of others. What other men
9018,BOOK XVI.,"later born shall have profit of thee, if thou dost not ward off base"
9019,BOOK XVI.,"ruin from the Argives? Pitiless that thou art, the knight Peleus was"
9020,BOOK XVI.,"not then thy father, nor Thetis thy mother, but the grey sea bare thee,"
9021,BOOK XVI.,"and the sheer cliffs, so untoward is thy spirit. But if in thy heart"
9022,BOOK XVI.,"thou art shunning some oracle, and thy lady mother hath told thee"
9023,BOOK XVI.,"somewhat from Zeus, yet me do thou send forth quickly, and make the"
9024,BOOK XVI.,"rest of the host of the Myrmidons follow me, if yet any light may arise"
9025,BOOK XVI.,from me to the Danaans. And give me thy harness to buckle about my
9026,BOOK XVI.,"shoulders, if perchance the Trojans may take me for thee, and so"
9027,BOOK XVI.,"abstain from battle, and the warlike sons of the Achaians may take"
9028,BOOK XVI.,"breath, wearied as they be, for brief is the breathing in war. And"
9029,BOOK XVI.,lightly might we that are fresh drive men wearied with the battle back
9030,BOOK XVI.,"to the citadel, away from the ships and the huts.”"
9031,BOOK XVI.,
9032,BOOK XVI.,"So he spake and besought him, in his unwittingness, for truly it was to"
9033,BOOK XVI.,be his own evil death and fate that he prayed for. Then to him in great
9034,BOOK XVI.,"heaviness spake swift-footed Achilles: “Ah me, Patroklos of the seed of"
9035,BOOK XVI.,"Zeus, what word hast thou spoken? Neither take I heed of any oracle"
9036,BOOK XVI.,"that I wot of, nor yet has my lady mother told me somewhat from Zeus,"
9037,BOOK XVI.,"but this dread sorrow comes upon my heart and spirit, from the hour"
9038,BOOK XVI.,"that a man wishes to rob me who am his equal, and to take away my"
9039,BOOK XVI.,"prize, for that he excels me in power. A dread sorrow to me is this,"
9040,BOOK XVI.,after all the toils that my heart hath endured. The maiden that the
9041,BOOK XVI.,"sons of the Achaians chose out for me as my prize, and that I won with"
9042,BOOK XVI.,"my spear when I sacked a well-walled city, her has mighty Agamemnon the"
9043,BOOK XVI.,"son of Atreus taken back out of my hands, as though I were but some"
9044,BOOK XVI.,sojourner dishonourable. But we will let bygones be bygones. No man may
9045,BOOK XVI.,"be angry of heart for ever, yet verily I said that I would not cease"
9046,BOOK XVI.,"from my wrath, until that time when to mine own ships should come the"
9047,BOOK XVI.,"war-cry and the battle. But do thou on thy shoulders my famous harness,"
9048,BOOK XVI.,"and lead the war-loving Myrmidons to the fight, to ward off destruction"
9049,BOOK XVI.,"from the ships, lest they even burn the ships with blazing fire, and"
9050,BOOK XVI.,take away our desired return. But when thou hast driven them from the
9051,BOOK XVI.,"ships, return, and even if the loud-thundering lord of Hera grant thee"
9052,BOOK XVI.,"to win glory, yet long not thou apart from me to fight with the"
9053,BOOK XVI.,war-loving Trojans; thereby wilt thou minish mine honour. Neither do
9054,BOOK XVI.,"thou, exulting in war and strife, and slaying the Trojans, lead on"
9055,BOOK XVI.,"toward Ilios, lest one of the eternal gods from Olympus come against"
9056,BOOK XVI.,"thee; right dearly doth Apollo the Far-darter love them. Nay, return"
9057,BOOK XVI.,"back when thou halt brought safety to the ships, and suffer the rest to"
9058,BOOK XVI.,"fight along the plain. For would, O father Zeus, and Athene, and"
9059,BOOK XVI.,"Apollo, would that not one of all the Trojans might escape death, nor"
9060,BOOK XVI.,"one of the Argives, but that we twain might avoid destruction, that"
9061,BOOK XVI.,alone we might undo the sacred coronal of Troy.”
9062,BOOK XVI.,
9063,BOOK XVI.,"So spake they each to other, but Aias no longer abode the onset, for he"
9064,BOOK XVI.,"was overpowered by darts; the counsel of Zeus was subduing him, and the"
9065,BOOK XVI.,"shafts of the proud Trojans; and his bright helmet, being smitten, kept"
9066,BOOK XVI.,ringing terribly about his temples: for always it was smitten upon the
9067,BOOK XVI.,"fair-wrought cheek-pieces. Moreover his left shoulder was wearied, as"
9068,BOOK XVI.,"steadfastly he held up his glittering shield, nor yet could they make"
9069,BOOK XVI.,"him give ground, as they pressed on with their darts around him. And"
9070,BOOK XVI.,"ever he was worn out with difficult breath, and much sweat kept running"
9071,BOOK XVI.,"from all his limbs, nor had he a moment to draw breath, so on all sides"
9072,BOOK XVI.,was evil heaped on evil.
9073,BOOK XVI.,
9074,BOOK XVI.,"Tell me now, ye Muses that have mansions in Olympus, how first fire"
9075,BOOK XVI.,"fell on the ships of the Achaians. Hector drew near, and the ashen"
9076,BOOK XVI.,"spear of Aias he smote with his great sword, hard by the socket, behind"
9077,BOOK XVI.,"the point, and shore it clean away, and the son of Telamon brandished"
9078,BOOK XVI.,"in his hand no more than a pointless spear, and far from him the head"
9079,BOOK XVI.,of bronze fell ringing on the ground.
9080,BOOK XVI.,
9081,BOOK XVI.,"And Aias knew in his noble heart, and shuddered at the deeds of the"
9082,BOOK XVI.,"gods, even how Zeus that thundereth on high did utterly cut off from"
9083,BOOK XVI.,"him avail in war, and desired victory for the Trojans. Then Aias gave"
9084,BOOK XVI.,back out of the darts. But the Trojans cast on the swift ship
9085,BOOK XVI.,"unwearying fire, and instantly the inextinguishable flame streamed over"
9086,BOOK XVI.,"her: so the fire begirt the stern, whereon Achilles smote his thighs,"
9087,BOOK XVI.,"and spake to Patroklos: “Arise, Patroklos of the seed of Zeus,"
9088,BOOK XVI.,"commander of the horsemen, for truly I see by the ships the rush of the"
9089,BOOK XVI.,"consuming fire. Up then, lest they take the ships, and there be no more"
9090,BOOK XVI.,"retreat; do on thy harness speedily, and I will summon the host.”"
9091,BOOK XVI.,
9092,BOOK XVI.,"So spake he, while Patroklos was harnessing him in shining bronze. His"
9093,BOOK XVI.,"goodly greaves, fitted with silver clasps, he first girt round his"
9094,BOOK XVI.,"legs, and next did on around his breast the well-dight starry corslet"
9095,BOOK XVI.,of the swift-footed son of Aiakos. And round his shoulders he cast a
9096,BOOK XVI.,"sword of bronze, with studs of silver, and next took the great and"
9097,BOOK XVI.,"mighty shield, and on his proud head set a well-wrought helm with a"
9098,BOOK XVI.,"horse-hair crest, and terribly nodded the crest from above. Then seized"
9099,BOOK XVI.,"he two strong lances that fitted his grasp, only he took not the spear"
9100,BOOK XVI.,"of the noble son of Aiakos, heavy, and huge, and stalwart, that none"
9101,BOOK XVI.,other of the Achaians could wield. And Patroklos bade Automedon to yoke
9102,BOOK XVI.,"the horses speedily, even Automedon whom most he honoured after"
9103,BOOK XVI.,"Achilles, the breaker of the ranks of men, and whom he held trustiest"
9104,BOOK XVI.,in battle to abide his call. And for him Automedon led beneath the yoke
9105,BOOK XVI.,"the swift horses, Xanthos and Balios, that fly as swift as the winds,"
9106,BOOK XVI.,"the horses that the harpy Podarge bare to the West Wind, as she grazed"
9107,BOOK XVI.,on the meadow by the stream of Okeanos. And in the side-traces he put
9108,BOOK XVI.,"the goodly Pedasos, that Achilles carried away, when he took the city"
9109,BOOK XVI.,"of Eetion; and being but a mortal steed, he followed with the immortal"
9110,BOOK XVI.,horses.
9111,BOOK XVI.,
9112,BOOK XVI.,Meanwhile Achilles went and harnessed all the Myrmidons in the huts
9113,BOOK XVI.,"with armour, and they gathered like ravening wolves with strength in"
9114,BOOK XVI.,their hearts unspeakable. And among them all stood warlike Achilles
9115,BOOK XVI.,urging on the horses and the targeteers. And he aroused the heart and
9116,BOOK XVI.,"valour of each of them, and the ranks were yet the closer serried when"
9117,BOOK XVI.,they heard the prince. And as when a man builds the wall of a high
9118,BOOK XVI.,"house with close-set stones, to avoid the might of the winds, even so"
9119,BOOK XVI.,"close were arrayed the helmets and bossy shields, and shield pressed on"
9120,BOOK XVI.,"shield, helm on helm, and man on man, and the horse-hair crests on the"
9121,BOOK XVI.,"bright helmet-ridges touched each other when they nodded, so close they"
9122,BOOK XVI.,stood by each other.
9123,BOOK XVI.,
9124,BOOK XVI.,And straightway they poured forth like wasps that have their dwelling
9125,BOOK XVI.,"by the wayside, and that boys are ever wont to vex, always tormenting"
9126,BOOK XVI.,"them in their nests beside the way in childish sport, and a common evil"
9127,BOOK XVI.,they make for many. With heart and spirit like theirs the Myrmidons
9128,BOOK XVI.,"poured out now from the ships, and a cry arose unquenchable, and"
9129,BOOK XVI.,"Patroklos called on his comrades, shouting aloud: “Myrmidons, ye"
9130,BOOK XVI.,"comrades of Achilles son of Peleus, be men, my friends, and be mindful"
9131,BOOK XVI.,"of your impetuous valour, that so we may win honour for the son of"
9132,BOOK XVI.,"Peleus, that is far the bravest of the Argives by the ships, and whose"
9133,BOOK XVI.,close-fighting squires are the best. And let wide-ruling Agamemnon the
9134,BOOK XVI.,"son of Atreus learn his own blindness of heart, in that he nothing"
9135,BOOK XVI.,honoured the best of the Achaians.”
9136,BOOK XVI.,
9137,BOOK XVI.,"So spake he, and aroused each man’s heart and courage, and all in a"
9138,BOOK XVI.,"mass they fell on the Trojans, and the ships around echoed wondrously"
9139,BOOK XVI.,to the cry of the Achaians. But when the Trojans beheld the strong son
9140,BOOK XVI.,"of Menoitios, himself and his squire, shining in their armour, the"
9141,BOOK XVI.,"heart was stirred in all of them, and the companies wavered, for they"
9142,BOOK XVI.,deemed that by the ships the swift-footed son of Peleus had cast away
9143,BOOK XVI.,"his wrath, and chosen reconcilement: then each man glanced round, to"
9144,BOOK XVI.,see where he might flee sheer destruction.
9145,BOOK XVI.,
9146,BOOK XVI.,"But Patroklos first with a shining spear cast straight into the press,"
9147,BOOK XVI.,"where most men were thronging, even by the stern of the ship of"
9148,BOOK XVI.,"great-hearted Protesilaos, and he smote Pyraichmes, who led his"
9149,BOOK XVI.,"Paionian horsemen out of Amydon, from the wide water of Axios; him he"
9150,BOOK XVI.,"smote on the right shoulder, and he fell on his back in the dust with a"
9151,BOOK XVI.,"groan, and his comrades around him, the Paionians, were afraid, for"
9152,BOOK XVI.,"Patroklos sent fear among them all, when he slew their leader that was"
9153,BOOK XVI.,"ever the best in fight. Then he drove them out from the ships, and"
9154,BOOK XVI.,"quenched the burning fire. And the half-burnt ship was left there, and"
9155,BOOK XVI.,"the Trojans fled, with a marvellous din, and the Danaans poured in"
9156,BOOK XVI.,"among the hollow ships, and ceaseless was the shouting. And as when"
9157,BOOK XVI.,"from the high crest of a great hill Zeus, the gatherer of the"
9158,BOOK XVI.,"lightning, hath stirred a dense cloud, and forth shine all the peaks,"
9159,BOOK XVI.,"and sharp promontories, and glades, and from heaven the infinite air"
9160,BOOK XVI.,"breaks open, even so the Danaans, having driven the blazing fire from"
9161,BOOK XVI.,"the ships, for a little while took breath, but there was no pause in"
9162,BOOK XVI.,the battle. For not yet were the Trojans driven in utter rout by the
9163,BOOK XVI.,"Achaians, dear to Ares, from the black ships, but they still stood up"
9164,BOOK XVI.,"against them, and only perforce gave ground from the ships. But even as"
9165,BOOK XVI.,"robber wolves fall on the lambs or kids, choosing them out of the"
9166,BOOK XVI.,"herds, when they are scattered on hills by the witlessness of the"
9167,BOOK XVI.,"shepherd, and the wolves behold it, and speedily harry the younglings"
9168,BOOK XVI.,"that have no heart of courage,—even so the Danaans fell on the Trojans,"
9169,BOOK XVI.,"and they were mindful of ill-sounding flight, and forgot their"
9170,BOOK XVI.,impetuous valour.
9171,BOOK XVI.,
9172,BOOK XVI.,But that great Aias ever was fain to cast his spear at Hector of the
9173,BOOK XVI.,"helm of bronze, but he, in his cunning of war, covered his broad"
9174,BOOK XVI.,"shoulders with his shield of bulls’ hide, and watched the hurtling of"
9175,BOOK XVI.,"the arrows, and the noise of spears. And verily well he knew the change"
9176,BOOK XVI.,"in the mastery of war, but even so he abode, and was striving to rescue"
9177,BOOK XVI.,his trusty comrades.
9178,BOOK XVI.,
9179,BOOK XVI.,"And as when from Olympus a cloud fares into heaven, from the sacred"
9180,BOOK XVI.,"air, when Zeus spreadeth forth the tempest, even so from the ships came"
9181,BOOK XVI.,"the war-cry and the rout, nor in order due did they cross the ditch"
9182,BOOK XVI.,"again. But his swift-footed horses bare Hector forth with his arms, and"
9183,BOOK XVI.,"he left the host of Troy, whom the delved trench restrained against"
9184,BOOK XVI.,their will. And in the trench did many swift steeds that draw the car
9185,BOOK XVI.,"break the fore-part of the pole, and leave the chariots of their"
9186,BOOK XVI.,masters.
9187,BOOK XVI.,
9188,BOOK XVI.,"But Patroklos followed after, crying fiercely to the Danaans, and full"
9189,BOOK XVI.,"of evil will against the Trojans, while they with cries and flight"
9190,BOOK XVI.,"filled all the ways, for they were scattered, and on high the storm of"
9191,BOOK XVI.,"dust was scattered below the clouds, and the whole-hooved horses"
9192,BOOK XVI.,"strained back towards the city, away from the ships and the huts."
9193,BOOK XVI.,
9194,BOOK XVI.,"But even where Patroklos saw the folk thickest in the rout, thither did"
9195,BOOK XVI.,"he guide his horses with a cry, and under his axle-trees men fell prone"
9196,BOOK XVI.,"from their chariots, and the cars were overturned with a din of"
9197,BOOK XVI.,"shattering. But straight over the ditch, in forward flight, leaped the"
9198,BOOK XVI.,"swift horses. And the heart of Patroklos urged him against Hector, for"
9199,BOOK XVI.,"he was eager to smite him, but his swift steeds bore Hector forth and"
9200,BOOK XVI.,"away. And even as beneath a tempest the whole black earth is oppressed,"
9201,BOOK XVI.,"on an autumn day, when Zeus pours forth rain most vehemently, and all"
9202,BOOK XVI.,"the rivers run full, and many a scaur the torrents tear away, and down"
9203,BOOK XVI.,"to the dark sea they rush headlong from the hills, roaring mightily,"
9204,BOOK XVI.,"and minished are the works of men, even so mighty was the roar of the"
9205,BOOK XVI.,Trojan horses as they ran.
9206,BOOK XVI.,
9207,BOOK XVI.,"Now Patroklos when he had cloven the nearest companies, drave them"
9208,BOOK XVI.,"backward again to the ships, nor suffered them to approach the city,"
9209,BOOK XVI.,"despite their desire, but between the ships, and the river, and the"
9210,BOOK XVI.,"lofty wall, he rushed on them, and slew them, and avenged many a"
9211,BOOK XVI.,"comrade slain. There first he smote Pronoos with a shining spear, where"
9212,BOOK XVI.,"the shield left bare the breast, and loosened his limbs, and he fell"
9213,BOOK XVI.,"with a crash. Then Thestor the son of Enops he next assailed, as he sat"
9214,BOOK XVI.,"crouching in the polished chariot, for he was struck distraught, and"
9215,BOOK XVI.,"the reins flew from his hands. Him he drew near, and smote with the"
9216,BOOK XVI.,"lance on the right jaw, and clean pierced through his teeth. And"
9217,BOOK XVI.,Patroklos caught hold of the spear and dragged him over the rim of the
9218,BOOK XVI.,"car, as when a man sits on a jutting rock, and drags a sacred fish"
9219,BOOK XVI.,"forth from the sea, with line and glittering hook of bronze; so on the"
9220,BOOK XVI.,"bright spear dragged he Thestor gaping from the chariot, and cast him"
9221,BOOK XVI.,"down on his face and life left him as he fell. Next, as Euryalos came"
9222,BOOK XVI.,"on, he smote him on the midst of the head with a stone, and all his"
9223,BOOK XVI.,"head was shattered within the strong helmet, and prone on the earth he"
9224,BOOK XVI.,"fell, and death that slayeth the spirit overwhelmed him. Next Erymas,"
9225,BOOK XVI.,"and Amphoteros, and Epaltes and Tlepolemos son of Damastor, and Echios"
9226,BOOK XVI.,"and Pyris, and Ipheus and Euippos, and Polymelos son of Argeas, all"
9227,BOOK XVI.,these in turn he brought low to the bounteous earth. But when Sarpedon
9228,BOOK XVI.,"beheld his comrades with ungirdled doublets, subdued beneath the hands"
9229,BOOK XVI.,"of Patroklos son of Menoitios, he cried aloud, upbraiding the godlike"
9230,BOOK XVI.,"Lykians: “Shame, ye Lykians, whither do ye flee? Now be ye strong, for"
9231,BOOK XVI.,"I will encounter this man that I may know who he is that conquers here,"
9232,BOOK XVI.,"and verily many evils hath he wrought the Trojans, in that he hath"
9233,BOOK XVI.,loosened the knees of many men and noble.”
9234,BOOK XVI.,
9235,BOOK XVI.,"So spake he, and leaped with his arms from the chariot to the ground."
9236,BOOK XVI.,"But Patroklos, on the other side, when he beheld him leaped from his"
9237,BOOK XVI.,"chariot. And they, like vultures of crooked talons and curved beaks,"
9238,BOOK XVI.,"that war with loud yells on some high cliff, even so they rushed with"
9239,BOOK XVI.,cries against each other. And beholding then the son of Kronos of the
9240,BOOK XVI.,"crooked counsels took pity on them, and he spake to Hera, his sister"
9241,BOOK XVI.,"and wife: “Ah woe is me for that it is fated that Sarpedon, the"
9242,BOOK XVI.,"best-beloved of men to me, shall be subdued under Patroklos son of"
9243,BOOK XVI.,"Menoitios. And in two ways my heart within my breast is divided, as I"
9244,BOOK XVI.,"ponder whether I should catch him up alive out of the tearful war, and"
9245,BOOK XVI.,"set him down in the rich land of Lykia, or whether I should now subdue"
9246,BOOK XVI.,him beneath the hands of the son of Menoitios.”
9247,BOOK XVI.,
9248,BOOK XVI.,Then the ox-eyed lady Hera made answer to him: “Most dread son of
9249,BOOK XVI.,"Kronos, what word is this thou hast spoken? A mortal man long doomed to"
9250,BOOK XVI.,fate dost thou desire to deliver again from death of evil name? Work
9251,BOOK XVI.,"thy will, but all we other gods will in no wise praise thee. And"
9252,BOOK XVI.,"another thing I will tell thee, and do thou lay it up in thy heart; if"
9253,BOOK XVI.,"thou dost send Sarpedon living to his own house, consider lest thereon"
9254,BOOK XVI.,some other god likewise desire to send his own dear son away out of the
9255,BOOK XVI.,strong battle. For round the great citadel of Priam war many sons of
9256,BOOK XVI.,"the Immortals, and among the Immortals wilt thou send terrible wrath."
9257,BOOK XVI.,"But if he be dear to thee, and thy heart mourns for him, truly then"
9258,BOOK XVI.,suffer him to be subdued in the strong battle beneath the hands of
9259,BOOK XVI.,"Patroklos son of Menoitios, but when his soul and life leave that"
9260,BOOK XVI.,"warrior, send Death and sweet Sleep to bear him, even till they come to"
9261,BOOK XVI.,"the land of wide Lykia, there will his kindred and friends bury him,"
9262,BOOK XVI.,"with a barrow and a pillar, for this is the due of the dead.”"
9263,BOOK XVI.,
9264,BOOK XVI.,"So spake she, nor did the father of gods and men disregard her. But he"
9265,BOOK XVI.,"shed bloody raindrops on the earth, honouring his dear son, that"
9266,BOOK XVI.,"Patroklos was about to slay in the deep-soiled land of Troia, far off"
9267,BOOK XVI.,"from his own country. Now when they were come near each other in onset,"
9268,BOOK XVI.,"there verily did Patroklos smite the renowned Thrasymelos, the good"
9269,BOOK XVI.,"squire of the prince Sarpedon, on the lower part of the belly, and"
9270,BOOK XVI.,"loosened his limbs. But Sarpedon missed him with his shining javelin,"
9271,BOOK XVI.,"as he in turn rushed on, but wounded the horse Pedasos on the right"
9272,BOOK XVI.,"shoulder with the spear, and he shrieked as he breathed his life away,"
9273,BOOK XVI.,"and fell crying in the dust, and his spirit fled from him. But the"
9274,BOOK XVI.,"other twain reared this way and that, and the yoke creaked, and the"
9275,BOOK XVI.,"reins were confused on them, when their trace-horse lay in the dust."
9276,BOOK XVI.,"But thereof did Automedon, the spearman renowned, find a remedy, and"
9277,BOOK XVI.,"drawing his long-edged sword from his stout thigh, he leaped forth, and"
9278,BOOK XVI.,"cut adrift the horse, with no delay, and the pair righted themselves,"
9279,BOOK XVI.,"and strained in the reins, and they met again in life-devouring war."
9280,BOOK XVI.,
9281,BOOK XVI.,"Then again Sarpedon missed with his shining dart, and the point of the"
9282,BOOK XVI.,"spear flew over the left shoulder of Patroklos and smote him not, but"
9283,BOOK XVI.,"he in turn arose with the bronze, and his javelin flew not vainly from"
9284,BOOK XVI.,"his hand, but struck Sarpedon even where the midriff clasps the beating"
9285,BOOK XVI.,"heart. And he fell as falls an oak, or a silver poplar, or a slim pine"
9286,BOOK XVI.,"tree, that on the hills the shipwrights fell with whetted axes, to be"
9287,BOOK XVI.,timber for ship-building; even so before the horses and chariot he lay
9288,BOOK XVI.,"at length, moaning aloud, and clutching at the bloody dust. And as when"
9289,BOOK XVI.,"a lion hath fallen on a herd, and slain a bull, tawny and high of"
9290,BOOK XVI.,"heart, among the kine of trailing gait, and he perishes groaning"
9291,BOOK XVI.,"beneath the claws of the lion, even so under Patroklos did the leader"
9292,BOOK XVI.,"of the Lykian shieldmen rage, even in death, and he called to his dear"
9293,BOOK XVI.,"comrade: “Dear Glaukos, warrior among warlike men, now most doth it"
9294,BOOK XVI.,"behove thee to be a spearman, and a hardy fighter: now let baneful war"
9295,BOOK XVI.,"be dear to thee, if indeed thou art a man of might. First fare all"
9296,BOOK XVI.,"about and urge on the heroes that be leaders of the Lykians, to fight"
9297,BOOK XVI.,"for Sarpedon, and thereafter thyself do battle for me with the sword."
9298,BOOK XVI.,For to thee even in time to come shall I be shame and disgrace for
9299,BOOK XVI.,"ever, all thy days, if the Achaians strip me of mine armour, fallen in"
9300,BOOK XVI.,"the gathering of the ships. Nay, hold out manfully, and spur on all the"
9301,BOOK XVI.,host.”
9302,BOOK XVI.,
9303,BOOK XVI.,"Even as he spake thus, the end of death veiled over his eyes and his"
9304,BOOK XVI.,"nostrils, but Patroklos, setting foot on his breast drew the spear out"
9305,BOOK XVI.,"of his flesh, and the midriff followed with the spear, so that he drew"
9306,BOOK XVI.,"forth together the spear point, and the soul of Sarpedon; and the"
9307,BOOK XVI.,"Myrmidons held there his panting steeds, eager to fly afar, since the"
9308,BOOK XVI.,chariot was reft of its lords.
9309,BOOK XVI.,
9310,BOOK XVI.,"Then dread sorrow came on Glaukos, when he heard the voice of Sarpedon,"
9311,BOOK XVI.,"and his heart was stirred, that he availed not to succour him. And with"
9312,BOOK XVI.,"his hand he caught and held his arm, for the wound galled him, the"
9313,BOOK XVI.,"wound of the arrow wherewith, as he pressed on towards the lofty wall,"
9314,BOOK XVI.,"Teukros had smitten him, warding off destruction from his fellows. Then"
9315,BOOK XVI.,"in prayer spake Glaukos to far-darting Apollo: “Hear, O Prince that art"
9316,BOOK XVI.,"somewhere in the rich land of Lykia, or in Troia, for thou canst listen"
9317,BOOK XVI.,"everywhere to the man that is in need, as even now need cometh upon me."
9318,BOOK XVI.,"For I have this stark wound, and mine arm is thoroughly pierced with"
9319,BOOK XVI.,"sharp pains, nor can my blood be stanched, and by the wound is my"
9320,BOOK XVI.,"shoulder burdened, and I cannot hold my spear firm, nor go and fight"
9321,BOOK XVI.,"against the enemy. And the best of men has perished, Sarpedon, the son"
9322,BOOK XVI.,"of Zeus, and he succours not even his own child. But do thou, O Prince,"
9323,BOOK XVI.,"heal me this stark wound, and lull my pains, and give me strength, that"
9324,BOOK XVI.,"I may call on my Lykian kinsmen, and spur them to the war, and myself"
9325,BOOK XVI.,may fight about the dead man fallen.”
9326,BOOK XVI.,
9327,BOOK XVI.,"So spake he in his prayer, and Phoebus Apollo heard him. Straightway he"
9328,BOOK XVI.,"made his pains to cease, and in the grievous wound stanched the black"
9329,BOOK XVI.,"blood, and put courage into his heart. And Glaukos knew it within him,"
9330,BOOK XVI.,"and was glad, for that the great god speedily heard his prayer. First"
9331,BOOK XVI.,went he all about and urged on them that were leaders of the Lykians to
9332,BOOK XVI.,"fight around Sarpedon, and thereafter he went with long strides among"
9333,BOOK XVI.,"the Trojans, to Polydamas son of Panthoos and noble Agenor, and he went"
9334,BOOK XVI.,"after Aineias, and Hector of the helm of bronze, and standing by them"
9335,BOOK XVI.,"spake winged words: “Hector, now surely art thou utterly forgetful of"
9336,BOOK XVI.,"the allies, that for thy sake, far from their friends and their own"
9337,BOOK XVI.,"country, breathe their lives away! but thou carest not to aid them!"
9338,BOOK XVI.,"Sarpedon lies low, the leader of the Lykian shieldmen, he that defended"
9339,BOOK XVI.,"Lykia by his dooms and his might, yea him hath mailed Ares subdued"
9340,BOOK XVI.,"beneath the spear of Patroklos. But, friends, stand by him, and be"
9341,BOOK XVI.,"angry in your hearts lest the Myrmidons strip him of his harness, and"
9342,BOOK XVI.,"dishonour the dead, in wrath for the sake of the Danaans, even them"
9343,BOOK XVI.,"that perished, whom we slew with spears by the swift ships.”"
9344,BOOK XVI.,
9345,BOOK XVI.,"So spake he, and sorrow seized the Trojans utterly, ungovernable and"
9346,BOOK XVI.,"not to be borne; for Sarpedon was ever the stay of their city, all a"
9347,BOOK XVI.,"stranger as he was, for many people followed with him, and himself the"
9348,BOOK XVI.,best warrior of them all. Then they made straight for the Danaans
9349,BOOK XVI.,"eagerly, and Hector led them, being wroth for Sarpedon’s sake. But the"
9350,BOOK XVI.,fierce heart of Patrokloa son of Menoitios urged on the Achaians. And
9351,BOOK XVI.,he spake first to the twain Aiantes that themselves were right eager:
9352,BOOK XVI.,"“Aiantes, now let defence be your desire, and be such as afore ye were"
9353,BOOK XVI.,"among men, or even braver yet. That man lies low who first leaped on to"
9354,BOOK XVI.,"the wall of the Achaians, even Sarpedon. Nay, let us strive to take"
9355,BOOK XVI.,"him, and work his body shame, and strip the harness from his shoulders,"
9356,BOOK XVI.,and many a one of his comrades fighting for his sake let us subdue with
9357,BOOK XVI.,the pitiless bronze.”
9358,BOOK XVI.,
9359,BOOK XVI.,"So spake he, and they themselves were eager in defence. So on both"
9360,BOOK XVI.,"sides they strengthened the companies, Trojans and Lykians, Myrmidons"
9361,BOOK XVI.,"and Achaians, and they joined battle to fight around the dead man"
9362,BOOK XVI.,"fallen; terribly they shouted, and loud rang the harness of men. And as"
9363,BOOK XVI.,"the din ariseth of woodcutters in the glades of a mountain, and the"
9364,BOOK XVI.,"sound thereof is heard far away, so rose the din of them from the"
9365,BOOK XVI.,"wide-wayed earth, the noise of bronze and of well-tanned bulls’ hides"
9366,BOOK XVI.,smitten with swords and double-pointed spears. And now not even a
9367,BOOK XVI.,"clear-sighted man could any longer have known noble Sarpedon, for with"
9368,BOOK XVI.,darts and blood and dust was he covered wholly from head to foot. And
9369,BOOK XVI.,"ever men thronged about the dead, as in a steading flies buzz around"
9370,BOOK XVI.,"the full milk-pails, in the season of spring, when the milk drenches"
9371,BOOK XVI.,"the bowls, even so thronged they about the dead. Nor ever did Zeus turn"
9372,BOOK XVI.,"from the strong fight his shining eyes, but ever looked down on them,"
9373,BOOK XVI.,"and much in his heart he debated of the slaying of Patroklos, whether"
9374,BOOK XVI.,there and then above divine Sarpedon glorious Hector should slay him
9375,BOOK XVI.,"likewise in strong battle with the sword, and strip his harness from"
9376,BOOK XVI.,"his shoulders, or whether to more men yet he should deal sheer labour"
9377,BOOK XVI.,"of war. And thus to him as he pondered it seemed the better way, that"
9378,BOOK XVI.,"the gallant squire of Achilles, Peleus’ son, should straightway drive"
9379,BOOK XVI.,"the Trojans and Hector of the helm of bronze towards the city, and"
9380,BOOK XVI.,should rob many of their life. And in Hector first he put a weakling
9381,BOOK XVI.,"heart, and leaping into his car Hector turned in flight, and cried on"
9382,BOOK XVI.,"the rest of the Trojans to flee, for he knew the turning of the sacred"
9383,BOOK XVI.,"scales of Zeus. Thereon neither did the strong Lykians abide, but fled"
9384,BOOK XVI.,"all in fear, when they beheld their king stricken to the heart, lying"
9385,BOOK XVI.,"in the company of the dead, for many had fallen above him, when Kronion"
9386,BOOK XVI.,made fierce the fight. Then the others stripped from the shoulders of
9387,BOOK XVI.,"Sarpedon his shining arms of bronze, and these the strong son of"
9388,BOOK XVI.,Menoitios gave to his comrades to bear to the hollow ships. Then Zeus
9389,BOOK XVI.,"that gathereth the clouds spake to Apollo: “Prithee, dear Phoebus, go"
9390,BOOK XVI.,"take Sarpedon out of range of darts, and cleanse the black blood from"
9391,BOOK XVI.,"him, and thereafter bear him far away, and bathe him in the streams of"
9392,BOOK XVI.,"the river, and anoint him with ambrosia, and clothe him in garments"
9393,BOOK XVI.,"that wax not old, and send him to be wafted by fleet convoy, by the"
9394,BOOK XVI.,"twin brethren Sleep and Death, that quickly will set him in the rich"
9395,BOOK XVI.,land of wide Lykia. There will his kinsmen and clansmen give him
9396,BOOK XVI.,"burial, with barrow and pillar, for such is the due of the dead.”"
9397,BOOK XVI.,
9398,BOOK XVI.,"So spake he, nor was Apollo disobedient to his father. He went down the"
9399,BOOK XVI.,"hills of Ida to the dread battle din, and straight way bore goodly"
9400,BOOK XVI.,"Sarpedon out of the darts, and carried him far away and bathed him in"
9401,BOOK XVI.,"the streams of the river, and anointed him with ambrosia, and clad him"
9402,BOOK XVI.,"in garments that wax not old, and sent him to be wafted by fleet"
9403,BOOK XVI.,"convoy, the twin brethren Sleep and Death, that swiftly set him down in"
9404,BOOK XVI.,the rich land of wide Lykia. But Patroklos cried to his horses and
9405,BOOK XVI.,"Automedon, and after the Trojans and Lykians went he, and so was"
9406,BOOK XVI.,"blindly forgetful, in his witlessness, for if he had kept the saying of"
9407,BOOK XVI.,"the son of Peleus, verily he should have escaped the evil fate of black"
9408,BOOK XVI.,"death. But ever is the wit of Zeus stronger than the wit of men, so now"
9409,BOOK XVI.,"he roused the spirit of Patroklos in his breast. There whom first, whom"
9410,BOOK XVI.,"last didst thou slay, Patroklos, when the gods called thee deathward?"
9411,BOOK XVI.,"Adrestos first, and Autonoos, and Echeklos, and Perimos, son of Megas,"
9412,BOOK XVI.,"and Epistor, and Melanippos, and thereafter Elasos, and Moulios, and"
9413,BOOK XVI.,"Pylartes; these he slew, but the others were each man of them fain of"
9414,BOOK XVI.,"flight. Then would the sons of the Achaians have taken high-gated Troy,"
9415,BOOK XVI.,"by the hands of Patroklos, for around and before him he raged with the"
9416,BOOK XVI.,"spear, but that Phoebus Apollo stood on the well-builded wall, with"
9417,BOOK XVI.,"baneful thoughts towards Patroklos, and succouring the Trojans. Thrice"
9418,BOOK XVI.,"clomb Patroklos on the corner of the lofty wall, and thrice did Apollo"
9419,BOOK XVI.,force him back and smote the shining shield with his immortal hands.
9420,BOOK XVI.,"But when for the fourth time he came on like a god, then cried"
9421,BOOK XVI.,"far-darting Apollo terribly, and spake winged words: “Give back,"
9422,BOOK XVI.,Patroklos of the seed of Zeus! Not beneath thy spear is it fated that
9423,BOOK XVI.,"the city of the valiant Trojans shall fall, nay nor beneath Achilles, a"
9424,BOOK XVI.,man far better than thou.”
9425,BOOK XVI.,
9426,BOOK XVI.,"So spake he, and Patroklos retreated far back, avoiding the wrath of"
9427,BOOK XVI.,far-darting Apollo. But Hector within the Skaian gates was restraining
9428,BOOK XVI.,"his whole-hooved horses, pondering whether he should drive again into"
9429,BOOK XVI.,"the din and fight, or should call unto the host to gather to the wall."
9430,BOOK XVI.,"While thus he was thinking, Phoebus Apollo stood by him in the guise of"
9431,BOOK XVI.,"a young man and a strong, Asios, who was the mother’s brother of"
9432,BOOK XVI.,"horse-taming Hector, being own brother of Hekabe, and son of Dymas, who"
9433,BOOK XVI.,"dwelt in Phrygia, on the streams of Sangarios. In his guise spake"
9434,BOOK XVI.,"Apollo, son of Zeus, to Hector: “Hector, wherefore dost thou cease from"
9435,BOOK XVI.,fight? It doth not behove thee. Would that I were as much stronger than
9436,BOOK XVI.,"thou as I am weaker, thereon quickly shouldst thou stand aloof from war"
9437,BOOK XVI.,"to thy hurt. But come, turn against Patroklos thy strong-hooved horses,"
9438,BOOK XVI.,"if perchance thou mayst slay him, and Apollo give thee glory.”"
9439,BOOK XVI.,
9440,BOOK XVI.,"So spake the god, and went back again into the moil of men. But"
9441,BOOK XVI.,renowned Hector bade wise-hearted Kebriones to lash his horses into the
9442,BOOK XVI.,"war. Then Apollo went and passed into the press, and sent a dread panic"
9443,BOOK XVI.,"among the Argives, but to the Trojans and Hector gave he renown. And"
9444,BOOK XVI.,"Hector let the other Argives be, and slew none of them, but against"
9445,BOOK XVI.,"Patroklos he turned his strong-hooved horses, and Patroklos on the"
9446,BOOK XVI.,"other side leaped from his chariot to the ground, with a spear in his"
9447,BOOK XVI.,"left hand, and in his other hand grasped a shining jagged stone, that"
9448,BOOK XVI.,"his hand covered. Firmly he planted himself and hurled it, nor long did"
9449,BOOK XVI.,"he shrink from his foe, nor was his cast in vain, but he struck"
9450,BOOK XVI.,"Kebriones the charioteer of Hector, the bastard son of renowned Priam,"
9451,BOOK XVI.,"on the brow with the sharp stone, as he held the reins of the horses."
9452,BOOK XVI.,"Both his brows the stone drave together, and his bone held not, but his"
9453,BOOK XVI.,"eyes fell to the ground in the dust, there, in front of his feet. Then"
9454,BOOK XVI.,"he, like a diver, fell from the well-wrought car, and his spirit left"
9455,BOOK XVI.,"his bones. Then taunting him didst thou address him, knightly"
9456,BOOK XVI.,"Patroklos: “Out on it, how nimble a man, how lightly he diveth! Yea, if"
9457,BOOK XVI.,"perchance he were on the teeming deep, this man would satisfy many by"
9458,BOOK XVI.,"seeking for oysters, leaping from the ship, even if it were stormy"
9459,BOOK XVI.,"weather, so lightly now he diveth from the chariot into the plain."
9460,BOOK XVI.,Verily among the Trojans too there be diving men.”
9461,BOOK XVI.,
9462,BOOK XVI.,"So speaking he set on the hero Kebriones with the rush of a lion, that"
9463,BOOK XVI.,"while wasting the cattle-pens is smitten in the breast, and his own"
9464,BOOK XVI.,"valour is his bane, even so against Kebriones, Patroklos, didst thou"
9465,BOOK XVI.,"leap furiously. But Hector, on the other side, leaped from his chariot"
9466,BOOK XVI.,"to the ground. And these twain strove for Kebriones like lions, that on"
9467,BOOK XVI.,"the mountain peaks fight, both hungering, both high of heart, for a"
9468,BOOK XVI.,slain hind. Even so for Kebriones’ sake these two masters of the
9469,BOOK XVI.,"war-cry, Patroklos son of Menoitios, and renowned Hector, were eager"
9470,BOOK XVI.,each to hew the other’s flesh with the ruthless bronze.
9471,BOOK XVI.,
9472,BOOK XVI.,"Hector then seized him by the head, and slackened not hold, while"
9473,BOOK XVI.,"Patroklos on the other side grasped him by the foot, and thereon the"
9474,BOOK XVI.,"others, Trojans and Danaans, joined strong battle. And as the East wind"
9475,BOOK XVI.,and the South contend with one another in shaking a deep wood in the
9476,BOOK XVI.,"dells of a mountain, shaking beech, and ash, and smooth-barked cornel"
9477,BOOK XVI.,"tree, that clash against each other their long boughs with marvellous"
9478,BOOK XVI.,"din, and a noise of branches broken, so the Trojans and Achaians were"
9479,BOOK XVI.,"leaping on each other and slaying, nor had either side any thought of"
9480,BOOK XVI.,"ruinous flight. And many sharp darts were fixed around Kebriones, and"
9481,BOOK XVI.,"winged arrows leaping from the bow-string, and many mighty stones smote"
9482,BOOK XVI.,the shields of them that fought around him. But he in the whirl of dust
9483,BOOK XVI.,"lay mighty and mightily fallen, forgetful of his chivalry."
9484,BOOK XVI.,
9485,BOOK XVI.,"Now while the sun was going about mid-heaven, so long the darts smote"
9486,BOOK XVI.,"either side, and the host fell, but when the sun turned to the time of"
9487,BOOK XVI.,"the loosing of oxen, lo, then beyond their doom the Achaians proved the"
9488,BOOK XVI.,"better. The hero Kebriones drew they forth from the darts, out of the"
9489,BOOK XVI.,"tumult of the Trojans, and stripped the harness from his shoulders, and"
9490,BOOK XVI.,"with ill design against the Trojans, Patroklos rushed upon them. Three"
9491,BOOK XVI.,"times then rushed he on, peer of swift Ares, shouting terribly, and"
9492,BOOK XVI.,thrice he slew nine men. But when the fourth time he sped on like a
9493,BOOK XVI.,"god, thereon to thee, Patroklos, did the end of life appear, for"
9494,BOOK XVI.,"Phoebus met thee in the strong battle, in dreadful wise. And Patroklos"
9495,BOOK XVI.,"was not ware of him coming through the press, for hidden in thick mist"
9496,BOOK XVI.,"did he meet him, and stood behind him, and smote his back and broad"
9497,BOOK XVI.,"shoulders with a down-stroke of his hand, and his eyes were dazed. And"
9498,BOOK XVI.,from his head Phoebus Apollo smote the helmet that rolled rattling away
9499,BOOK XVI.,"with a din beneath the hooves of the horses, the helm with upright"
9500,BOOK XVI.,"socket, and the crests were defiled with blood and dust. And all the"
9501,BOOK XVI.,"long-shadowed spear was shattered in the hands of Patroklos, the spear"
9502,BOOK XVI.,"great and heavy and strong, and sharp, while from his shoulders the"
9503,BOOK XVI.,tasselled shield with the baldric fell to the ground.
9504,BOOK XVI.,
9505,BOOK XVI.,"And the prince Apollo, son of Zeus, loosed his corslet, and blindness"
9506,BOOK XVI.,"seized his heart and his shining limbs were unstrung, and he stood in"
9507,BOOK XVI.,"amaze, and at close quarters from behind a Dardanian smote him on the"
9508,BOOK XVI.,"back, between the shoulders, with a sharp spear, even Euphorbos, son of"
9509,BOOK XVI.,"Panthoos, who excelled them of his age in casting the spear, and in"
9510,BOOK XVI.,"horsemanship, and in speed of foot. Even thus, verily, had he cast down"
9511,BOOK XVI.,"twenty men from their chariots, though then first had he come with his"
9512,BOOK XVI.,car to learn the lesson of war. He it was that first smote a dart into
9513,BOOK XVI.,"thee, knightly Patroklos, nor overcame thee, but ran back again and"
9514,BOOK XVI.,"mingled with the throng, first drawing forth from the flesh his ashen"
9515,BOOK XVI.,"spear, nor did he abide the onset of Patroklos, unarmed as he was, in"
9516,BOOK XVI.,"the strife. But Patroklos, being overcome by the stroke of the god, and"
9517,BOOK XVI.,"by the spear, gave ground, and retreated to the host of his comrades,"
9518,BOOK XVI.,"avoiding Fate. But Hector, when he beheld great-hearted Patroklos give"
9519,BOOK XVI.,"ground, being smitten with the keen bronze, came nigh unto him through"
9520,BOOK XVI.,"the ranks, and wounded him with a spear, in the lowermost part of the"
9521,BOOK XVI.,"belly, and drave the bronze clean through. And he fell with a crash,"
9522,BOOK XVI.,and sorely grieved the host of Achaians. And as when a lion hath
9523,BOOK XVI.,"overcome in battle an untiring boar, they twain fighting with high"
9524,BOOK XVI.,"heart on the crests of a hill, about a little well, and both are"
9525,BOOK XVI.,"desirous to drink, and the lion hath by force overcome the boar that"
9526,BOOK XVI.,draweth difficult breath; so after that he had slain many did Hector
9527,BOOK XVI.,"son of Priam take the life away from the strong son of Menoitios,"
9528,BOOK XVI.,smiting him at close quarters with the spear; and boasting over him he
9529,BOOK XVI.,"spake winged words: “Patroklos, surely thou saidst that thou wouldst"
9530,BOOK XVI.,"sack my town, and from Trojan women take away the day of freedom, and"
9531,BOOK XVI.,"bring them in ships to thine own dear country: fool! nay, in front of"
9532,BOOK XVI.,these were the swift horses of Hector straining their speed for the
9533,BOOK XVI.,fight; and myself in wielding the spear excel among the war-loving
9534,BOOK XVI.,"Trojans, even I who ward from them the day of destiny: but thee shall"
9535,BOOK XVI.,"vultures here devour. Ah, wretch, surely Achilles for all his valour,"
9536,BOOK XVI.,"availed thee not, who straitly charged thee as thou camest, he abiding"
9537,BOOK XVI.,"there, saying, ‘Come not to me, Patroklos lord of steeds, to the hollow"
9538,BOOK XVI.,"ships, till thou hast torn the gory doublet of man-slaying Hector about"
9539,BOOK XVI.,"his breast;’ so, surely, he spake to thee, and persuaded the wits of"
9540,BOOK XVI.,thee in thy witlessness.”
9541,BOOK XVI.,
9542,BOOK XVI.,"Then faintly didst thou answer him, knightly Patroklos: “Boast greatly,"
9543,BOOK XVI.,"as now, Hector, for to thee have Zeus, son of Kronos, and Apollo given"
9544,BOOK XVI.,"the victory, who lightly have subdued me; for themselves stripped my"
9545,BOOK XVI.,harness from my shoulders. But if twenty such as thou had encountered
9546,BOOK XVI.,"me, here had they all perished, subdued beneath my spear. But me have"
9547,BOOK XVI.,"ruinous Fate and the son of Leto slain, and of men Euphorbos, but thou"
9548,BOOK XVI.,"art the third in my slaying. But another thing will I tell thee, and do"
9549,BOOK XVI.,"thou lay it up in thy heart: verily thou thyself art not long to live,"
9550,BOOK XVI.,"but already doth Death stand hard by thee, and strong Fate, that thou"
9551,BOOK XVI.,"art to be subdued by the hands of noble Achilles, of the seed of"
9552,BOOK XVI.,Aiakos.”
9553,BOOK XVI.,
9554,BOOK XVI.,"Even as so he spake the end of death overshadowed him. And his soul,"
9555,BOOK XVI.,"fleeting from his limbs, went down to the house of Hades, wailing its"
9556,BOOK XVI.,"own doom, leaving manhood and youth."
9557,BOOK XVI.,
9558,BOOK XVI.,"Then renowned Hector spake to him even in his death: “Patroklos,"
9559,BOOK XVI.,wherefore to me dolt thou prophesy sheer destruction? who knows but
9560,BOOK XVI.,"that Achilles, the child of fair-tressed Thetis, will first be smitten"
9561,BOOK XVI.,"by my spear, and lose his life?”"
9562,BOOK XVI.,
9563,BOOK XVI.,"So spake he, and drew the spear of bronze from the wound, setting his"
9564,BOOK XVI.,"foot on the dead, and cast him off on his back from the spear. And"
9565,BOOK XVI.,"straightway with the spear he went after Automedon, the godlike squire"
9566,BOOK XVI.,"of the swift-footed Aiakides, for he was eager to smite him; but his"
9567,BOOK XVI.,"swift-footed immortal horses bare him out of the battle, horses that"
9568,BOOK XVI.,"the gods gave to Peleus, a splendid gift."
9569,BOOK XVI.,
9570,BOOK XVI.,
9571,BOOK XVI.,
9572,BOOK XVI.,
9573,BOOK XVII.,BOOK XVII.
9574,BOOK XVII.,
9575,BOOK XVII.,
9576,BOOK XVII.,Of the battle around the body of Patroklos.
9577,BOOK XVII.,
9578,BOOK XVII.,
9579,BOOK XVII.,"But Atreus’ son, Menelaos dear to Ares, was not unaware of the slaying"
9580,BOOK XVII.,of Patroklos by the Trojans in the fray. He went up through the front
9581,BOOK XVII.,"of the fight harnessed in flashing bronze, and strode over the body as"
9582,BOOK XVII.,above a first-born calf standeth lowing its mother. Thus above
9583,BOOK XVII.,"Patroklos strode fair-haired Menelaos, and before him held his spear"
9584,BOOK XVII.,"and the circle of his shield, eager to slay whoever should encounter"
9585,BOOK XVII.,him. Then was Panthoos’ son of the stout ashen spear not heedless of
9586,BOOK XVII.,"noble Patroklos as he lay, and he smote on the circle of the shield of"
9587,BOOK XVII.,"Menelaos, but the bronze spear brake it not, but the point was bent"
9588,BOOK XVII.,back in the stubborn shield. And Menelaos Atreus’ son in his turn made
9589,BOOK XVII.,"at him with his bronze spear, having prayed unto father Zeus, and as he"
9590,BOOK XVII.,"gave back pierced the nether part of his throat, and threw his weight"
9591,BOOK XVII.,"into the stroke, following his heavy hand; and sheer through the tender"
9592,BOOK XVII.,"neck went the point of the spear. And he fell with a crash, and his"
9593,BOOK XVII.,armour rang upon him. In blood was his hair drenched that was like unto
9594,BOOK XVII.,"the hair of the Graces, and his tresses closely knit with bands of"
9595,BOOK XVII.,silver and gold.
9596,BOOK XVII.,
9597,BOOK XVII.,Then easily would the son of Atreus have borne off the noble spoils of
9598,BOOK XVII.,"Panthoos’ son, had not Phoebus Apollo grudged it to him, and aroused"
9599,BOOK XVII.,"against him Hector peer of swift Ares, putting on the semblance of a"
9600,BOOK XVII.,"man, of Mentes chief of the Kikones. And he spake aloud to him winged"
9601,BOOK XVII.,"words: “Hector, now art thou hasting after things unattainable, even"
9602,BOOK XVII.,the horses of wise Aiakides; for hard are they to be tamed or driven by
9603,BOOK XVII.,"mortal man, save only Achilles whom an immortal mother bare. Meanwhile"
9604,BOOK XVII.,hath warlike Menelaos Atreus’ son stridden over Patroklos and slain the
9605,BOOK XVII.,"best of the Trojans there, even Panthoos’ son Euphorbos, and hath"
9606,BOOK XVII.,stayed him in his impetuous might.”
9607,BOOK XVII.,
9608,BOOK XVII.,"Thus saying the god went back into the strife of men, but dire grief"
9609,BOOK XVII.,"darkened Hectors inmost soul, and then he gazed searchingly along the"
9610,BOOK XVII.,"lines, and straightway was aware of the one man stripping off the noble"
9611,BOOK XVII.,"arms, and the other lying on the earth; and blood was flowing about the"
9612,BOOK XVII.,gaping wound. Then he went through the front of the fight harnessed in
9613,BOOK XVII.,"flashing bronze, crying a shrill cry, like unto Hephaistos’ flame"
9614,BOOK XVII.,"unquenchable. Not deaf to his shrill cry was Atreus’ son, and sore"
9615,BOOK XVII.,"troubled he spake to his great heart: “Ay me, if I shall leave behind"
9616,BOOK XVII.,"me these goodly arms, and Patroklos who here lieth for my vengeance’"
9617,BOOK XVII.,"sake, I fear lest some Danaan beholding it be wroth against me. But if"
9618,BOOK XVII.,"for honour’s sake I do battle alone with Hector and the Trojans, I fear"
9619,BOOK XVII.,lest they come about me many against one; for all the Trojans is
9620,BOOK XVII.,bright-helmed Hector leading hither. But if I might somewhere find Aias
9621,BOOK XVII.,"of the loud war-cry, then both together would we go and be mindful of"
9622,BOOK XVII.,"battle even were it against the power of heaven, if haply we might save"
9623,BOOK XVII.,his dead for Achilles Peleus’ son: that were best among these ills.”
9624,BOOK XVII.,
9625,BOOK XVII.,"While thus he communed with his mind and heart, therewithal the Trojan"
9626,BOOK XVII.,"ranks came onward, and Hector at their head. Then Menelaos gave"
9627,BOOK XVII.,"backward, and left the dead man, turning himself ever about like a"
9628,BOOK XVII.,deep-waned lion which men and dogs chase from a fold with spears and
9629,BOOK XVII.,"cries; and his strong heart within him groweth chill, and loth goeth he"
9630,BOOK XVII.,"from the steading; so from Patroklos went fair-haired Menelaos, and"
9631,BOOK XVII.,"turned and stood, when he came to the host of his comrades, searching"
9632,BOOK XVII.,for mighty Aias Telamon’s son. Him very speedily he espied on the left
9633,BOOK XVII.,"of the whole battle, cheering his comrades and rousing them to fight,"
9634,BOOK XVII.,for great terror had Phoebus Apollo sent on them; and he hasted him to
9635,BOOK XVII.,"run, and straightway stood by him and said: “This way, beloved Aias;"
9636,BOOK XVII.,"let us bestir us for the dead Patroklos, if haply his naked corpse at"
9637,BOOK XVII.,"least we may carry to Achilles, though his armour is held by Hector of"
9638,BOOK XVII.,the glancing helm.”
9639,BOOK XVII.,
9640,BOOK XVII.,"Thus spake he, and aroused the heart of wise Aias. And he went up"
9641,BOOK XVII.,"through the front of the fight, and with him fair-haired Menelaos. Now"
9642,BOOK XVII.,"Hector, when he had stripped from Patroklos his noble armour, was"
9643,BOOK XVII.,dragging him thence that he might cut off the head from the shoulders
9644,BOOK XVII.,with the keen bronze and carry his body to give to the dogs of Troy.
9645,BOOK XVII.,"But Aias came anigh, and the shield that he bare was as a tower; then"
9646,BOOK XVII.,"Hector gave back into the company of his comrades, and sprang into his"
9647,BOOK XVII.,chariot; and the goodly armour he gave to the Trojans to carry to the
9648,BOOK XVII.,"city, to be great glory unto him. But Aias spread his broad shield over"
9649,BOOK XVII.,the son of Menoitios and stood as it were a lion before his whelps when
9650,BOOK XVII.,huntsmen in a forest encounter him as he leadeth his young. And by his
9651,BOOK XVII.,"side stood Atreus’ son, Menelaos dear to Ares, nursing great sorrow in"
9652,BOOK XVII.,his breast.
9653,BOOK XVII.,
9654,BOOK XVII.,Then Hector called on the Trojans with a mighty shout; “Trojans and
9655,BOOK XVII.,"Lykians and Dardanians that fight hand to hand, be men, my friends, and"
9656,BOOK XVII.,"bethink you of impetuous valour, until I do on me the goodly arms of"
9657,BOOK XVII.,noble Achilles that I stripped from brave Patroklos when I slew him.”
9658,BOOK XVII.,
9659,BOOK XVII.,Thus having spoken went Hector of the glancing helm forth out of the
9660,BOOK XVII.,"strife of war, and ran and speedily with fleet feet following overtook"
9661,BOOK XVII.,"his comrades, not yet far off, who were bearing to the city Peleides’"
9662,BOOK XVII.,glorious arms. And standing apart from the dolorous battle he changed
9663,BOOK XVII.,his armour; his own he gave the warlike Trojans to carry to sacred
9664,BOOK XVII.,"Ilios, and he put on the divine arms of Achilles, Peleus’ son."
9665,BOOK XVII.,
9666,BOOK XVII.,But when Zeus that gathereth the clouds beheld from afar off Hector
9667,BOOK XVII.,"arming him in the armour of Peleus’ godlike son, he shook his head and"
9668,BOOK XVII.,"spake thus unto his soul: “Ah, hapless man, no thought is in thy heart"
9669,BOOK XVII.,of death that yet draweth nigh unto thee; thou doest on thee the divine
9670,BOOK XVII.,"armour of a peerless man before whom the rest have terror. His comrade,"
9671,BOOK XVII.,"gentle and brave, thou hast slain, and unmeetly hast stripped the"
9672,BOOK XVII.,armour from his head and shoulders; yet now for a while at least I will
9673,BOOK XVII.,"give into thy hands great might, in recompense for this, even that"
9674,BOOK XVII.,"nowise shalt thou come home out of the battle, for Andromache to"
9675,BOOK XVII.,receive from thee Peleides’ glorious arms.”
9676,BOOK XVII.,
9677,BOOK XVII.,"Thus spake the son of Kronos, and bowed his dark brows therewithal."
9678,BOOK XVII.,
9679,BOOK XVII.,"But the armour fitted itself unto Hectors body, and Ares the dread"
9680,BOOK XVII.,"war-god entered into him, and his limbs were filled within with valour"
9681,BOOK XVII.,"and strength. Then he sped among the noble allies with a mighty cry,"
9682,BOOK XVII.,and in the flashing of his armour he seemed to all of them like unto
9683,BOOK XVII.,Peleus’ great-hearted son. And he came to each and encouraged him with
9684,BOOK XVII.,his words—Mesthles and Glaukos and Medon and Thersilochos and
9685,BOOK XVII.,Asteropaios and Deisenor and Hippothoos and Phorkys and Chromios and
9686,BOOK XVII.,the augur Ennomos—these encouraged he and spake to them winged words:
9687,BOOK XVII.,"“Listen, ye countless tribes of allies that dwell round about. It was"
9688,BOOK XVII.,not for mere numbers that I sought or longed when I gathered each of
9689,BOOK XVII.,"you from your cities, but that ye might zealously guard the Trojans’"
9690,BOOK XVII.,wives and infant little ones from the war-loving Achaians. For this end
9691,BOOK XVII.,"am I wearying my people by taking gifts and food from them, and nursing"
9692,BOOK XVII.,thereby the courage of each of you. Now therefore let all turn straight
9693,BOOK XVII.,"against the foe and live or die, for such is the dalliance of war. And"
9694,BOOK XVII.,"whoso shall drag Patroklos, dead though he be, among the horse-taming"
9695,BOOK XVII.,"men of Troy, and make Aias yield, to him will I award half the spoils"
9696,BOOK XVII.,and keep half myself; so shall his glory be great as mine.”
9697,BOOK XVII.,
9698,BOOK XVII.,"Thus spake he, and they against the Danaans charged with all their"
9699,BOOK XVII.,"weight, levelling their spears, and their hearts were high of hope to"
9700,BOOK XVII.,"drag the corpse from under Aias, Telamon’s son. Fond men! from full"
9701,BOOK XVII.,many reft he life over that corpse. And then spake Aias to Menelaos of
9702,BOOK XVII.,"the loud war-cry: “Dear Menelaos, fosterling of Zeus, no longer count I"
9703,BOOK XVII.,that we two of ourselves shall return home out of the war. Nor have I
9704,BOOK XVII.,"so much dread for the corpse of Patroklos, that shall soon glut the"
9705,BOOK XVII.,"dogs and birds of the men of Troy, as for thy head and mine lest some"
9706,BOOK XVII.,"evil fall thereon, for all is shrouded by a storm-cloud of war, even by"
9707,BOOK XVII.,"Hector, and sheer doom stareth in our face. But come, call thou to the"
9708,BOOK XVII.,"best men of the Danaans, if haply any hear.”"
9709,BOOK XVII.,
9710,BOOK XVII.,"Thus spake he, and Menelaos of the loud war-cry disregarded him not,"
9711,BOOK XVII.,"but shouted unto the Danaans, crying a far-heard cry: “O friends, ye"
9712,BOOK XVII.,"leaders and counsellors of the Argives, who by the side of the sons of"
9713,BOOK XVII.,"Atreus, Agamemnon and Menelaos, drink at the common cost and are all"
9714,BOOK XVII.,"commanders of the host, on whom wait glory and honour from Zeus, hard"
9715,BOOK XVII.,is it for me to distinguish each chief amid the press—such blaze is
9716,BOOK XVII.,there of the strife of war. But let each go forward of himself and be
9717,BOOK XVII.,wroth at heart that Patroklos should become a sport among the dogs of
9718,BOOK XVII.,Troy.”
9719,BOOK XVII.,
9720,BOOK XVII.,"Thus spake he, and Oileus’ son fleet Aias heard him clearly, and was"
9721,BOOK XVII.,"first to run along the mellay to meet him, and after him Idomeneus, and"
9722,BOOK XVII.,"Idomeneus’ brother-in-arms, Meriones, peer of the man-slaying war-god."
9723,BOOK XVII.,"And who shall of his own thought tell the names of the rest, even of"
9724,BOOK XVII.,all that after these aroused the battle of the Achaians?
9725,BOOK XVII.,
9726,BOOK XVII.,"Now the Trojans charged forward in close array, and Hector led them."
9727,BOOK XVII.,And as when at the mouth of some heaven-born river a mighty wave
9728,BOOK XVII.,"roareth against the stream, and arouseth the high cliffs’ echo as the"
9729,BOOK XVII.,"salt sea belloweth on the beach, so loud was the cry wherewith the"
9730,BOOK XVII.,Trojans came. But the Achaians stood firm around Menoitios’ son with
9731,BOOK XVII.,"one soul all, walled in with shields of bronze. And over their bright"
9732,BOOK XVII.,"helmets the son of Kronos shed thick darkness, for in the former time"
9733,BOOK XVII.,"was Menoitios’ son not unloved of him, while he was yet alive and"
9734,BOOK XVII.,squire of Aiakides. So was Zeus loth that he should become a prey of
9735,BOOK XVII.,"the dogs of his enemies at Troy, and stirred his comrades to do battle"
9736,BOOK XVII.,for him.
9737,BOOK XVII.,
9738,BOOK XVII.,"Now first the Trojans thrust back the glancing-eyed Achaians, who"
9739,BOOK XVII.,"shrank before them and left the dead, yet the proud Trojans slew not"
9740,BOOK XVII.,"any of them with spears, though they were fain, but set to hale the"
9741,BOOK XVII.,"corpse. But little while would the Achaians hold back therefrom, for"
9742,BOOK XVII.,"very swiftly Aias rallied them, Aias the first in presence and in deeds"
9743,BOOK XVII.,of all the Danaans after the noble son of Peleus. Right through the
9744,BOOK XVII.,fighters in the forefront rushed he like a wild boar in his might that
9745,BOOK XVII.,in the mountains when he turneth at bay scattereth lightly dogs and
9746,BOOK XVII.,lusty young men through the glades. Thus did proud Telamon’s son the
9747,BOOK XVII.,"glorious Aias press on the Trojan battalions and lightly scatter them,"
9748,BOOK XVII.,as they had bestrode Patroklos and were full fain to drag him to their
9749,BOOK XVII.,city and win renown.
9750,BOOK XVII.,
9751,BOOK XVII.,Then would the Trojans in their turn in their weakness overcome have
9752,BOOK XVII.,"been driven back into Ilios by the Achaians dear to Ares, and the"
9753,BOOK XVII.,Argives would have won glory even against the appointment of Zeus by
9754,BOOK XVII.,"their power and might. But Apollo himself aroused Aineias, putting on"
9755,BOOK XVII.,"the semblance of Periphas the herald, the son of Epytos, who grew old"
9756,BOOK XVII.,"with his old father in his heraldship, of friendly thought toward"
9757,BOOK XVII.,"Aineias. In his similitude spake Apollo, son of Zeus: “Aineias, how"
9758,BOOK XVII.,could ye ever guard high Ilios if it were against the will of God?
9759,BOOK XVII.,Other men have I seen that trust in their own might and power and
9760,BOOK XVII.,"valour, and in their host, even though they have scant folk to lead."
9761,BOOK XVII.,"But here, albeit Zeus is fainer far to give victory to us than to the"
9762,BOOK XVII.,"Danaans, yet ye are dismayed exceedingly and fight not.”"
9763,BOOK XVII.,
9764,BOOK XVII.,"Thus spake he, and Aineias knew far-darting Apollo when he looked upon"
9765,BOOK XVII.,"his face, and spake unto Hector, shouting loud “Hector and ye other"
9766,BOOK XVII.,"leaders of the Trojans and their allies, shame were this if in our"
9767,BOOK XVII.,weakness overcome we were driven back into Ilios by the Achaians dear
9768,BOOK XVII.,"to Ares. Nay, thus saith a god, who standeth by my side: Zeus, highest"
9769,BOOK XVII.,"Orderer, is our helper in this fight. Therefore let us go right onward"
9770,BOOK XVII.,against the Danaans. Not easily at least let them take the dead
9771,BOOK XVII.,Patroklos to the ships.”
9772,BOOK XVII.,
9773,BOOK XVII.,"Thus spake he, and leapt forth far before the fighters in the front."
9774,BOOK XVII.,And the Trojans rallied and stood up against the Achaians. Thus strove
9775,BOOK XVII.,"they as it had been fire, nor wouldst thou have thought there was still"
9776,BOOK XVII.,"sun or moon, for over all the battle where the chiefs stood around the"
9777,BOOK XVII.,"slain son of Menoitios they were shrouded in darkness, while the other"
9778,BOOK XVII.,"Trojans and well-greaved Achaians fought at ease in the clear air, and"
9779,BOOK XVII.,"piercing sunlight was spread over them, and on all the earth and hills"
9780,BOOK XVII.,"there was no cloud seen; and they ceased fighting now sad again,"
9781,BOOK XVII.,avoiding each other’s dolorous darts and standing far apart. But they
9782,BOOK XVII.,who were in the midst endured affliction of the darkness and the
9783,BOOK XVII.,"battle, and all the best men of them were wearied by the pitiless"
9784,BOOK XVII.,weight of their bronze arms.
9785,BOOK XVII.,
9786,BOOK XVII.,Thus all day long waxed the mighty fray of their sore strife; and
9787,BOOK XVII.,unabatingly ever with the sweat of toil were the knees and legs and
9788,BOOK XVII.,feet of each man and arms anal eyes bedewed as the two hosts did battle
9789,BOOK XVII.,around the brave squire of fleet Aiakides. And as when a man giveth the
9790,BOOK XVII.,"hide of a great bull to his folk to stretch, all soaked in fat, and"
9791,BOOK XVII.,"they take and stretch it standing in a circle, and straightway the"
9792,BOOK XVII.,moisture thereof departeth and the fat entereth in under the haling of
9793,BOOK XVII.,"many hands, and it is all stretched throughout,—thus they on both sides"
9794,BOOK XVII.,"haled the dead man this way and that in narrow space, for their hearts"
9795,BOOK XVII.,"were high of hope, the Trojans that they should drag him to Ilios and"
9796,BOOK XVII.,"the Achaians to the hollow ships; and around him the fray waxed wild,"
9797,BOOK XVII.,"nor might Ares rouser of hosts nor Athene despise the sight thereof,"
9798,BOOK XVII.,albeit their anger were exceeding great.
9799,BOOK XVII.,
9800,BOOK XVII.,Such was the grievous travail of men and horses over Patroklos that
9801,BOOK XVII.,Zeus on that day wrought. But not as yet knew noble Achilles aught of
9802,BOOK XVII.,"Patroklos’ death, for far away from the swift ships they were fighting"
9803,BOOK XVII.,beneath the wall of the men of Troy. Therefore never deemed he in his
9804,BOOK XVII.,"heart that he was dead, but that he should come back alive, after that"
9805,BOOK XVII.,he had touched the gates; for neither that other thought had he
9806,BOOK XVII.,"anywise, that Patroklos should sack the stronghold without his aid."
9807,BOOK XVII.,
9808,BOOK XVII.,Now the rest continually around the dead man with their keen spears
9809,BOOK XVII.,made onset relentlessly and slew each the other. And thus would one
9810,BOOK XVII.,"speak among the mail-clad Achaians: “Friends, it were verily not"
9811,BOOK XVII.,glorious for us to go back to the hollow ships; rather let the black
9812,BOOK XVII.,earth yawn for us all beneath our feet. Far better were that
9813,BOOK XVII.,straightway for us if we suffer the horse-taming Trojans to hale this
9814,BOOK XVII.,man to their city and win renown.”
9815,BOOK XVII.,
9816,BOOK XVII.,And thus on the other side would one of the great-hearted Trojans say:
9817,BOOK XVII.,"“Friends, though it were our fate that all together we be slain beside"
9818,BOOK XVII.,"this man, let none yet give backward from the fray.”"
9819,BOOK XVII.,
9820,BOOK XVII.,"Thus would one speak, and rouse the spirit of each. So they fought on,"
9821,BOOK XVII.,and the iron din went up through the high desert air unto the brazen
9822,BOOK XVII.,heaven. But the horses of Aiakides that were apart from the battle were
9823,BOOK XVII.,"weeping, since first they were aware that their charioteer was fallen"
9824,BOOK XVII.,"in the dust beneath the hand of man-slaying Hector. Verily Automedon,"
9825,BOOK XVII.,"Diores’ valiant son, plied them oft with blows of the swift lash, and"
9826,BOOK XVII.,"oft with gentle words he spake to them and oft with chiding, yet would"
9827,BOOK XVII.,they neither go back to the ships at the broad Hellespont nor yet to
9828,BOOK XVII.,"the battle after the Achaians, but as a pillar abideth firm that"
9829,BOOK XVII.,"standeth on the tomb of a man or woman dead, so abode they immovably"
9830,BOOK XVII.,"with the beautiful chariot, abasing their heads unto the earth. And hot"
9831,BOOK XVII.,tears flowed from their eyes to the ground as they mourned in sorrow
9832,BOOK XVII.,"for their charioteer, and their rich manes were soiled as they drooped"
9833,BOOK XVII.,from beneath the yoke-cushion on both sides beside the yoke. And when
9834,BOOK XVII.,"the son of Kronos beheld them mourning he had compassion on them, and"
9835,BOOK XVII.,"shook his head and spake to his own heart: “Ah, hapless pair, why gave"
9836,BOOK XVII.,"we you to king Peleus, a mortal man, while ye are deathless and ever"
9837,BOOK XVII.,young? Was it that ye should suffer sorrows among ill-fated men? For
9838,BOOK XVII.,methinketh there is nothing more piteous than a man among all things
9839,BOOK XVII.,that breathe and creep upon the earth. But verily Hector Priam’s son
9840,BOOK XVII.,shall not drive you and your deftly-wrought car; that will I not
9841,BOOK XVII.,suffer. Is it a small thing that he holdeth the armour and vaunteth
9842,BOOK XVII.,"himself vainly thereupon? Nay, I will put courage into your knees and"
9843,BOOK XVII.,heart that ye may bring Automedon also safe out of the war to the
9844,BOOK XVII.,hollow ships. For yet further will I increase victory to the men of
9845,BOOK XVII.,"Troy, so that they slay until they come unto the well-timbered ships,"
9846,BOOK XVII.,and the sun set and divine night come down.”
9847,BOOK XVII.,
9848,BOOK XVII.,Thus saying he breathed good courage into the horses. And they shook to
9849,BOOK XVII.,"earth the dust from their manes, and lightly bare the swift car amid"
9850,BOOK XVII.,"Trojans and Achaians. And behind them fought Automedon, albeit in grief"
9851,BOOK XVII.,"for his comrade, swooping with his chariot as a vulture on wild geese;"
9852,BOOK XVII.,for lightly he would flee out of the onset of the Trojans and lightly
9853,BOOK XVII.,"charge, pursuing them through the thick mellay. Yet could he not slay"
9854,BOOK XVII.,"any man as he halted to pursue them, for it was impossible that being"
9855,BOOK XVII.,alone in his sacred car he should at once assail them with the spear
9856,BOOK XVII.,"and hold his fleet horses. Then at last espied him a comrade, even"
9857,BOOK XVII.,"Alkimedon son of Laerkes, son of Haimon, and he halted behind the car"
9858,BOOK XVII.,"and spake unto Automedon: “Automedon, what god hath put into thy breast"
9859,BOOK XVII.,"unprofitable counsel and taken from thee wisdom, that thus alone thou"
9860,BOOK XVII.,art fighting against the Trojans in the forefront of the press? Thy
9861,BOOK XVII.,"comrade even now was slain, and Hector goeth proudly, wearing on his"
9862,BOOK XVII.,own shoulders the armour of Aiakides.”
9863,BOOK XVII.,
9864,BOOK XVII.,"And Automedon son of Diores answered him, saying: “Alkimedon, what"
9865,BOOK XVII.,"other Achaian hath like skill to guide the spirit of immortal steeds,"
9866,BOOK XVII.,"save only Patroklos, peer of gods in counsel, while he yet lived? but"
9867,BOOK XVII.,now have death and fate overtaken him. But take thou the lash and
9868,BOOK XVII.,"shining reins, and I will get me down from my horses, that I may"
9869,BOOK XVII.,fight.”
9870,BOOK XVII.,
9871,BOOK XVII.,"Thus spake he, and Alkimedon leapt on the fleet war-chariot and swiftly"
9872,BOOK XVII.,"took the lash and reins in his hands, and Automedon leapt down. And"
9873,BOOK XVII.,"noble Hector espied them, and straightway spake unto Aineias as he"
9874,BOOK XVII.,"stood near: “Aineias, counsellor of mail-clad Trojans, I espy here the"
9875,BOOK XVII.,two horses of fleet Aiakides come forth to battle with feeble
9876,BOOK XVII.,charioteers. Therefore might I hope to take them if thou in thy heart
9877,BOOK XVII.,"art willing, since they would not abide our onset and stand to do"
9878,BOOK XVII.,battle against us.”
9879,BOOK XVII.,
9880,BOOK XVII.,"Thus spake he, and the brave son of Anchises disregarded him not. And"
9881,BOOK XVII.,"they twain went right onward, their shoulders shielded by ox-hides"
9882,BOOK XVII.,"dried and tough, and bronze thick overlaid. And with them went both"
9883,BOOK XVII.,"Chromios and godlike Aretos, and their hearts were of high hope to slay"
9884,BOOK XVII.,"the men and drive off the strong-necked horses—fond hope, for not"
9885,BOOK XVII.,without blood lost were they to get them back from Automedon. He
9886,BOOK XVII.,praying to father Zeus was filled in his inmost heart with valour and
9887,BOOK XVII.,"strength. And straightway he spake to Alkimedon, his faithful comrade:"
9888,BOOK XVII.,"“Alkimedon, hold the horses not far from me, but with their very breath"
9889,BOOK XVII.,upon my back; for I deem that Hector the son of Priam will not refrain
9890,BOOK XVII.,him from his fury until he mount behind Achilles’ horses of goodly
9891,BOOK XVII.,"manes after slaying us twain, and dismay the ranks of Argive men, or"
9892,BOOK XVII.,else himself fall among the foremost.”
9893,BOOK XVII.,
9894,BOOK XVII.,"Thus said he, and called upon the Aiantes and Menelaos: “Aiantes,"
9895,BOOK XVII.,"leaders of the Argives, and Menelaos, lo now, commit ye the corpse unto"
9896,BOOK XVII.,"whoso may best avail to bestride it and resist the ranks of men, and"
9897,BOOK XVII.,"come ye to ward the day of doom from us who are yet alive, for here in"
9898,BOOK XVII.,"the dolorous war are Hector and Aineias, the best men of the Trojans,"
9899,BOOK XVII.,pressing hard. Yet verily these issues lie in the lap of the gods: I
9900,BOOK XVII.,"too will cast my spear, and the rest shall Zeus decide.”"
9901,BOOK XVII.,
9902,BOOK XVII.,"He said, and poised his far-shadowing spear and hurled it, and smote on"
9903,BOOK XVII.,"the circle of the shield of Aretos, and the shield sustained not the"
9904,BOOK XVII.,"spear, but right through went the bronze, and he forced it into his"
9905,BOOK XVII.,belly low down through his belt. And as when a strong man with a sharp
9906,BOOK XVII.,axe smiting behind the horns of an ox of the homestead cleaveth the
9907,BOOK XVII.,"sinew asunder, and the ox leapeth forward and falleth, so leapt Aretos"
9908,BOOK XVII.,forward and fell on his back; and the spear in his entrails very
9909,BOOK XVII.,piercingly quivering unstrung his limbs. And Hector hurled at Automedon
9910,BOOK XVII.,"with his bright spear, but he looked steadfastly on the bronze javelin"
9911,BOOK XVII.,"as it came at him and avoided it, for he stooped forward, and the long"
9912,BOOK XVII.,"spear fixed itself in the ground behind, and the javelin-butt quivered,"
9913,BOOK XVII.,and there dread Ares took away its force. And then had they lashed at
9914,BOOK XVII.,"each other with their swords hand to hand, had not the Aiantes parted"
9915,BOOK XVII.,"them in their fury, when they were come through the mellay at their"
9916,BOOK XVII.,comrades’ call. Before them Hector and Aineias and godlike Chromios
9917,BOOK XVII.,shrank backward and gave ground and left Aretos wounded to the death as
9918,BOOK XVII.,"he lay. And Automedon, peer of swift Ares, stripped off the armour of"
9919,BOOK XVII.,"the dead, and spake exultingly: “Verily, I have a little eased my heart"
9920,BOOK XVII.,"of grief for the death of Menoitios’ son, albeit a worse man than him"
9921,BOOK XVII.,have I slain.”
9922,BOOK XVII.,
9923,BOOK XVII.,"Thus saying he took up the gory spoils and set them in his car, and gat"
9924,BOOK XVII.,"him thereon, with feet and hands all bloody, as a lion that hath"
9925,BOOK XVII.,devoured a bull.
9926,BOOK XVII.,
9927,BOOK XVII.,Now great-hearted Aias and Menelaos were aware of Zeus how he gave the
9928,BOOK XVII.,Trojans their turn to victory. First of these to speak was great Aias
9929,BOOK XVII.,"son of Telamon: “Ay me, now may any man, even though he be a very fool,"
9930,BOOK XVII.,"know that father Zeus himself is helping the Trojans. Come, let us"
9931,BOOK XVII.,"ourselves devise some excellent means, that we may both hale the corpse"
9932,BOOK XVII.,"away and ourselves return home to the joy of our friends, who grieve as"
9933,BOOK XVII.,they look hitherward and deem that no longer shall the fury of
9934,BOOK XVII.,"man-slaying Hector’s unapproachable hand refrain itself, but fall upon"
9935,BOOK XVII.,the black ships. And would there were some comrade to carry tidings
9936,BOOK XVII.,"with all speed unto the son of Peleus, since I deem that he hath not"
9937,BOOK XVII.,"even heard the grievous tidings, how his dear comrade is slain. But"
9938,BOOK XVII.,"nowhere can I behold such an one among the Achaians, for themselves and"
9939,BOOK XVII.,"their horses likewise are wrapped in darkness. O father Zeus, deliver"
9940,BOOK XVII.,"thou the sons of the Achaians from the darkness, and make clear sky and"
9941,BOOK XVII.,"vouchsafe sight unto our eyes. In the light be it that thou slayest us,"
9942,BOOK XVII.,since it is thy good pleasure that we die.”
9943,BOOK XVII.,
9944,BOOK XVII.,"Then fair-haired Menelaos departed glancing everywhither, as an eagle"
9945,BOOK XVII.,"which men say hath keenest sight of all birds under heaven, and though"
9946,BOOK XVII.,he be far aloft the fleet-footed hare eludeth him not by crouching
9947,BOOK XVII.,"beneath a leafy bush, but the eagle swoopeth thereon and swiftly"
9948,BOOK XVII.,"seizeth her and taketh her life. Thus in that hour, Menelaos fosterling"
9949,BOOK XVII.,"of Zeus, ranged thy shining eyes everywhither through the multitude of"
9950,BOOK XVII.,"the host of thy comrades, if haply they might behold Nestor’s son yet"
9951,BOOK XVII.,"alive. Him quickly he perceived at the left of the whole battle,"
9952,BOOK XVII.,heartening his comrades and rousing them to fight. And fair-haired
9953,BOOK XVII.,"Menelaos came and stood nigh and said unto him: “Antilochos, fosterling"
9954,BOOK XVII.,"of Zeus, come hither that thou mayest learn woful tidings—would it had"
9955,BOOK XVII.,"never been. Ere now, I ween, thou too hast known by thy beholding that"
9956,BOOK XVII.,"God rolleth mischief upon the Danaans, and with the Trojans is victory."
9957,BOOK XVII.,"And slain is the best man of the Achaians, Patroklos, and great sorrow"
9958,BOOK XVII.,is wrought for the Danaans. But run thou to the ships of the Achaians
9959,BOOK XVII.,"and quickly tell this to Achilles, if haply he may straightway rescue"
9960,BOOK XVII.,to his ship the naked corpse: but his armour is held by Hector of the
9961,BOOK XVII.,glancing helmet.”
9962,BOOK XVII.,
9963,BOOK XVII.,"Thus spake he, and Antilochos had horror of the word he heard. And long"
9964,BOOK XVII.,"time speechlessness possessed him, and his eyes were filled with tears,"
9965,BOOK XVII.,and his full voice choked. Yet for all this disregarded he not the
9966,BOOK XVII.,"bidding of Menelaos, but set him to run, when he had given his armour"
9967,BOOK XVII.,"to a noble comrade, Laodokos, who close anigh him was wheeling his"
9968,BOOK XVII.,whole-hooved horses.
9969,BOOK XVII.,
9970,BOOK XVII.,"So him his feet bare out of the battle weeping, to Achilles son of"
9971,BOOK XVII.,"Peleus carrying an evil tale. But thy heart, Menelaos fosterling of"
9972,BOOK XVII.,"Zeus, chose not to stay to aid the wearied comrades from whom"
9973,BOOK XVII.,"Antilochos departed, and great sorrow was among the Pylians. But to"
9974,BOOK XVII.,"them Menelaos sent noble Thrasymedes, and himself went again to"
9975,BOOK XVII.,bestride the hero Patroklos. And he hasted and stood beside the Aiantes
9976,BOOK XVII.,and straightway spake to them: “So have I sent that man to the swift
9977,BOOK XVII.,ships to go to fleet-footed Achilles. Yet deem I not that he will now
9978,BOOK XVII.,"come, for all his wrath against noble Hector, for he could not fight"
9979,BOOK XVII.,unarmed against the men of Troy. But let us ourselves devise some
9980,BOOK XVII.,"excellent means, both how we may hale the dead away, and how we"
9981,BOOK XVII.,ourselves may escape death and fate amid the Trojans’ battle-cry.”
9982,BOOK XVII.,
9983,BOOK XVII.,"Then answered him great Aias Telamon’s son, saying: “All this hast thou"
9984,BOOK XVII.,"said well, most noble Menelaos. But do thou and Meriones put your"
9985,BOOK XVII.,shoulders beneath the dead and lift him and bear him swiftly out of the
9986,BOOK XVII.,"fray, while we twain behind you shall do battle with the Trojans and"
9987,BOOK XVII.,"noble Hector, one in heart as we are in name, for from of old time we"
9988,BOOK XVII.,are wont to await fierce battle side by side.”
9989,BOOK XVII.,
9990,BOOK XVII.,"Thus spake he, and the others took the dead man in their arms and"
9991,BOOK XVII.,lifted him mightily on high. But the Trojan host behind cried aloud
9992,BOOK XVII.,"when they saw the Achaians lifting the corpse, and charged like hounds"
9993,BOOK XVII.,"that spring in front of hunter-youths upon a wounded wild boar, and for"
9994,BOOK XVII.,"a while run in haste to rend him, but when he wheeleth round among"
9995,BOOK XVII.,"them, trusting in his might, then they give ground and shrink back here"
9996,BOOK XVII.,and there. Thus for a while the Trojans pressed on with all their
9997,BOOK XVII.,"power, striking with swords and double-headed spears, but when the"
9998,BOOK XVII.,"Aiantes turned about and halted over against them, then they changed"
9999,BOOK XVII.,"colour, and none dared farther onset to do battle around the dead."
10000,BOOK XVII.,
10001,BOOK XVII.,
10002,BOOK XVII.,
10003,BOOK XVII.,
10004,BOOK XVIII.,BOOK XVIII.
10005,BOOK XVIII.,
10006,BOOK XVIII.,
10007,BOOK XVIII.,"How Achilles grieved for Patroklos, and how Thetis asked for him new"
10008,BOOK XVIII.,armour of Hephaistos; and of the making of the armour.
10009,BOOK XVIII.,
10010,BOOK XVIII.,
10011,BOOK XVIII.,"Thus fought the rest in the likeness of blazing fire, while to Achilles"
10012,BOOK XVIII.,"came Antilochos, a messenger fleet of foot. Him found he in front of"
10013,BOOK XVIII.,"his ships of upright horns, boding in his soul the things which even"
10014,BOOK XVIII.,now were accomplished. And sore troubled he spake to his great heart:
10015,BOOK XVIII.,"“Ay me, wherefore again are the flowing-haired Achaians flocking to the"
10016,BOOK XVIII.,ships and flying in rout over the plain? May the gods not have wrought
10017,BOOK XVIII.,"against me the grievous fears at my heart, even as my mother revealed"
10018,BOOK XVIII.,and told me that while I am yet alive the best man of the Myrmidons
10019,BOOK XVIII.,must by deed of the men of Troy forsake the light of the sun. Surely
10020,BOOK XVIII.,now must Menoitios’ valiant son be dead—foolhardy! surely I bade him
10021,BOOK XVIII.,when he should have beaten off the fire of the foe to come back to the
10022,BOOK XVIII.,ships nor with Hector fight amain.”
10023,BOOK XVIII.,
10024,BOOK XVIII.,"While thus he held debate in his heart and soul, there drew nigh unto"
10025,BOOK XVIII.,"him noble Nestor’s son, shedding hot tears, and spake his grievous"
10026,BOOK XVIII.,"tidings: “Ay me, wise Peleus’ son, very bitter tidings must thou hear,"
10027,BOOK XVIII.,"such as I would had never been. Fallen is Patroklos, and they are"
10028,BOOK XVIII.,"fighting around his body, naked, for his armour is held by Hector of"
10029,BOOK XVIII.,the glancing helm.”
10030,BOOK XVIII.,
10031,BOOK XVIII.,"Thus spake he, and a black cloud of grief enwrapped Achilles, and with"
10032,BOOK XVIII.,both hands he took dark dust and poured it over his head and defiled
10033,BOOK XVIII.,"his comely face, and on his fragrant doublet black ashes fell. And"
10034,BOOK XVIII.,"himself in the dust lay mighty and mightily fallen, and with his own"
10035,BOOK XVIII.,"hands tore and marred his hair. And the handmaidens, whom Achilles and"
10036,BOOK XVIII.,"Patroklos took captive, cried aloud in the grief of their hearts, and"
10037,BOOK XVIII.,"ran forth around valiant Achilles, and all beat on their breasts with"
10038,BOOK XVIII.,"their hands, and the knees of each of them were unstrung. And"
10039,BOOK XVIII.,"Antilochos on the other side wailed and shed tears, holding Achilles’"
10040,BOOK XVIII.,"hands while he groaned in his noble heart, for he feared lest he should"
10041,BOOK XVIII.,cleave his throat with the sword. Then terribly moaned Achilles; and
10042,BOOK XVIII.,his lady mother heard him as she sate in the depths of the sea beside
10043,BOOK XVIII.,"her ancient sire. And thereon she uttered a cry, and the goddesses"
10044,BOOK XVIII.,"flocked around her, all the daughters of Nereus that were in the deep"
10045,BOOK XVIII.,"of the sea. With these the bright cave was filled, and they all beat"
10046,BOOK XVIII.,"together on their breasts, and Thetis led the lament: “Listen, sister"
10047,BOOK XVIII.,"Nereids, that ye all hear and know well what sorrows are in my heart."
10048,BOOK XVIII.,"Ay me unhappy, ay me that bare to my sorrow the first of men! For after"
10049,BOOK XVIII.,"I had borne a son noble and strong, the chief of heroes, and he shot up"
10050,BOOK XVIII.,"like a young branch, then when I had reared him as a plant in a very"
10051,BOOK XVIII.,fruitful field I sent him in beaked ships to Ilios to fight against the
10052,BOOK XVIII.,"men of Troy; but never again shall I welcome him back to his home, to"
10053,BOOK XVIII.,the house of Peleus. And while he yet liveth in my sight and beholdeth
10054,BOOK XVIII.,"the light of the sun, he sorroweth, neither can I help him any whit"
10055,BOOK XVIII.,"though I go unto him. But I will go, that I may look upon my dear"
10056,BOOK XVIII.,"child, and learn what sorrow hath come to him though he abide aloof"
10057,BOOK XVIII.,from the war.”
10058,BOOK XVIII.,
10059,BOOK XVIII.,"Thus spake she and left the cave; and the nymphs went with her weeping,"
10060,BOOK XVIII.,and around them the surge of the sea was sundered. And when they came
10061,BOOK XVIII.,"to deep-soiled Troy-land they went up upon the shore in order, where"
10062,BOOK XVIII.,the ships of the Myrmidons were drawn up thickly around fleet Achilles.
10063,BOOK XVIII.,"And as he groaned heavily his lady mother stood beside him, and with a"
10064,BOOK XVIII.,"shrill cry clasped the bead of her child, and spake unto him winged"
10065,BOOK XVIII.,"words of lamentation: “My child, why weepest thou? what sorrow hath"
10066,BOOK XVIII.,"come to thy heart? Tell it forth, hide it not. One thing at least hath"
10067,BOOK XVIII.,"been accomplished of Zeus according to the prayer thou madest, holding"
10068,BOOK XVIII.,"up to him thy hands, that the sons of the Achaians should all be pent"
10069,BOOK XVIII.,"in at the ships, through lack of thee, and should suffer hateful"
10070,BOOK XVIII.,things.”
10071,BOOK XVIII.,
10072,BOOK XVIII.,Then groaning heavily spake unto her Achilles fleet of foot: “My
10073,BOOK XVIII.,"mother, that prayer truly hath the Olympian accomplished for me. But"
10074,BOOK XVIII.,"what delight have I therein, since my dear comrade is dead, Patroklos,"
10075,BOOK XVIII.,whom I honoured above all my comrades as it were my very self! Him have
10076,BOOK XVIII.,"I lost, and Hector that slew him hath stripped from him the armour"
10077,BOOK XVIII.,"great and fair, a wonder to behold, that the gods gave to Peleus a"
10078,BOOK XVIII.,"splendid gift, on the day when they laid thee in the bed of a mortal"
10079,BOOK XVIII.,"man. Would thou hadst abode among the deathless daughters of the sea,"
10080,BOOK XVIII.,"and Peleus had wedded a mortal bride! But now, that thou mayest have"
10081,BOOK XVIII.,"sorrow a thousand fold in thy heart for a dead son, never shalt thou"
10082,BOOK XVIII.,"welcome him back home, since my soul biddeth me also live no longer nor"
10083,BOOK XVIII.,"abide among men, if Hector be not first smitten by my spear and yield"
10084,BOOK XVIII.,"his life, and pay for his slaughter of Patroklos, Menoitios’ son.”"
10085,BOOK XVIII.,
10086,BOOK XVIII.,"Then answered unto him Thetis shedding tears: “Short-lived, I ween,"
10087,BOOK XVIII.,"must thou be then, my child, by what thou sayest, for straightway after"
10088,BOOK XVIII.,Hector is death appointed unto thee.”
10089,BOOK XVIII.,
10090,BOOK XVIII.,Then mightily moved spake unto her Achilles fleet of foot: “Straightway
10091,BOOK XVIII.,"may I die, since I might not succour my comrade at his slaying. He hath"
10092,BOOK XVIII.,fallen afar from his country and lacked my help in his sore need. Now
10093,BOOK XVIII.,"therefore, since I go not back to my dear native land, neither have at"
10094,BOOK XVIII.,all been succour to Patroklos nor to all my other comrades that have
10095,BOOK XVIII.,"been slain by noble Hector, but I sit beside my ships a profitless"
10096,BOOK XVIII.,"burden of the earth, I that in war am such an one as is none else of"
10097,BOOK XVIII.,"the mail-clad Achaians, though in council are others better—may strife"
10098,BOOK XVIII.,"perish utterly among gods and men, and wrath that stirreth even a wise"
10099,BOOK XVIII.,"man to be vexed, wrath that far sweeter than trickling honey waxeth"
10100,BOOK XVIII.,"like smoke in the breasts of men, even as I was wroth even now against"
10101,BOOK XVIII.,"Agamemnon king of men. But bygones will we let be, for all our pain,"
10102,BOOK XVIII.,"curbing the heart in our breasts under necessity. Now go I forth, that"
10103,BOOK XVIII.,"I may light on the destroyer of him I loved, on Hector: then will I"
10104,BOOK XVIII.,accept my death whensoever Zeus willeth to accomplish it and the other
10105,BOOK XVIII.,"immortal gods. For not even the mighty Herakles escaped death, albeit"
10106,BOOK XVIII.,"most dear to Kronian Zeus the king, but Fate overcame him and Hera’s"
10107,BOOK XVIII.,"cruel wrath. So also shall I, if my fate hath been fashioned likewise,"
10108,BOOK XVIII.,"lie low when I am dead. But now let me win high renown, let me set some"
10109,BOOK XVIII.,"Trojan woman, some deep-bosomed daughter of Dardanos, staunching with"
10110,BOOK XVIII.,"both hands the tears upon her tender cheeks and wailing bitterly; yea,"
10111,BOOK XVIII.,"let them know that I am come back, though I tarried long from the war."
10112,BOOK XVIII.,"Hold not me then from the battle in thy love, for thou shalt not"
10113,BOOK XVIII.,prevail with me.”
10114,BOOK XVIII.,
10115,BOOK XVIII.,"Then Thetis the silver-footed goddess answered him, saying: “Yea"
10116,BOOK XVIII.,"verily, my child, no blame is in this, that thou ward sheer destruction"
10117,BOOK XVIII.,from thy comrades in their distress. But thy fair glittering armour of
10118,BOOK XVIII.,bronze is held among the Trojans. Hector of the glancing helm beareth
10119,BOOK XVIII.,"it on his shoulders in triumph, yet not for long, I ween, shall he"
10120,BOOK XVIII.,"glory therein, for death is hard anigh him. But thou, go not yet down"
10121,BOOK XVIII.,into the mellay of war until thou see me with thine eyes come hither.
10122,BOOK XVIII.,"In the morning will I return, at the coming up of the sun, bearing fair"
10123,BOOK XVIII.,armour from the king Hephaistos.”
10124,BOOK XVIII.,
10125,BOOK XVIII.,"Thus spake she and turned to go from her son, and as she turned she"
10126,BOOK XVIII.,spake among her sisters of the sea: “Ye now go down within the wide
10127,BOOK XVIII.,"bosom of the deep, to visit the Ancient One of the Sea and our father’s"
10128,BOOK XVIII.,"house, and tell him all. I am going to high Olympus to Hephaistos of"
10129,BOOK XVIII.,"noble skill, if haply he will give unto my son noble armour shining"
10130,BOOK XVIII.,gloriously.”
10131,BOOK XVIII.,
10132,BOOK XVIII.,"Thus spake she, and they forthwith went down beneath the surge of the"
10133,BOOK XVIII.,sea. And the silver-footed goddess Thetis went on to Olympus that she
10134,BOOK XVIII.,might bring noble armour to her son.
10135,BOOK XVIII.,
10136,BOOK XVIII.,So her unto Olympus her feet bore. But the Achaians with terrible cries
10137,BOOK XVIII.,were fleeing before man-slaying Hector till they came to the ships and
10138,BOOK XVIII.,to the Hellespont. Nor might the well-greaved Achaians drag the corpse
10139,BOOK XVIII.,"of Patroklos Achilles’ squire out of the darts, for now again overtook"
10140,BOOK XVIII.,"him the host and the horses of Troy, and Hector son of Priam, in might"
10141,BOOK XVIII.,as it were a flame of fire. Thrice did glorious Hector seize him from
10142,BOOK XVIII.,"behind by the feet, resolved to drag him away, and mightily called upon"
10143,BOOK XVIII.,"the men of Troy. Thrice did the two Aiantes, clothed on with impetuous"
10144,BOOK XVIII.,"might, beat him off from the dead man, but he nathless, trusting in his"
10145,BOOK XVIII.,"might, anon would charge into the press, anon would stand and cry"
10146,BOOK XVIII.,"aloud, but he gave ground never a whit. As when shepherds in the field"
10147,BOOK XVIII.,avail nowise to chase a fiery lion in fierce hunger away from a
10148,BOOK XVIII.,"carcase, so availed not the two warrior Aiantes to scare Hector son of"
10149,BOOK XVIII.,Priam from the dead. And now would he have won the body and gained
10150,BOOK XVIII.,"renown unspeakable, had not fleet wind-footed Iris come speeding from"
10151,BOOK XVIII.,"Olympus with a message to the son of Peleus to array him, unknown of"
10152,BOOK XVIII.,"Zeus and the other gods, for Hera sent her. And she stood anigh and"
10153,BOOK XVIII.,"spake to him winged words: “Rouse thee, son of Peleus, of all men most"
10154,BOOK XVIII.,"redoubtable! Succour Patroklos, for whose body is terrible battle afoot"
10155,BOOK XVIII.,"before the ships. There slay they one another, these guarding the dead"
10156,BOOK XVIII.,"corpse, while the men of Troy are fierce to hale him unto windy Ilios,"
10157,BOOK XVIII.,"and chiefliest noble Hector is fain to drag him, and his heart biddeth"
10158,BOOK XVIII.,him fix the head on the stakes of the wall when he hath sundered it
10159,BOOK XVIII.,"from the tender neck. But arise, lie thus no longer! let awe enter thy"
10160,BOOK XVIII.,heart to forbid that Patroklos become the sport of dogs of Troy. Thine
10161,BOOK XVIII.,were the shame if he go down mangled amid the dead.”
10162,BOOK XVIII.,
10163,BOOK XVIII.,"Then answered her fleet-footed noble Achilles: “Goddess Iris, what god"
10164,BOOK XVIII.,sent thee a messenger unto me?”
10165,BOOK XVIII.,
10166,BOOK XVIII.,And to him again spake wind-footed fleet Iris: “It was Hera that sent
10167,BOOK XVIII.,"me, the wise wife of Zeus, nor knoweth the high-throned son of Kronos"
10168,BOOK XVIII.,nor any other of the Immortals that on snowy Olympus have their
10169,BOOK XVIII.,dwelling-place.”
10170,BOOK XVIII.,
10171,BOOK XVIII.,And Achilles fleet of foot made answer to her and said: “And how may I
10172,BOOK XVIII.,go into the fray? The Trojans hold my arms; and my dear mother bade me
10173,BOOK XVIII.,"forbear to array me until I behold her with my eyes returned, for she"
10174,BOOK XVIII.,promised to bring fair armour from Hephaistos. Other man know I none
10175,BOOK XVIII.,"whose noble armour I might put on, save it were the shield of Aias"
10176,BOOK XVIII.,"Telamon’s son. But himself, I ween, is in the forefront of the press,"
10177,BOOK XVIII.,dealing death with his spear around Patroklos dead.”
10178,BOOK XVIII.,
10179,BOOK XVIII.,Then again spake unto him wind-footed fleet Iris: “Well are we also
10180,BOOK XVIII.,aware that thy noble armour is held from thee. But go forth unto the
10181,BOOK XVIII.,"trench as thou art and show thyself to the men of Troy, if haply they"
10182,BOOK XVIII.,"will shrink back and refrain them from battle, and the warlike sons of"
10183,BOOK XVIII.,the Achaians take breath.”
10184,BOOK XVIII.,
10185,BOOK XVIII.,Thus spake fleet-footed Iris and went her way. But Achilles dear to
10186,BOOK XVIII.,"Zeus arose, and around his strong shoulders Athene cast her tasselled"
10187,BOOK XVIII.,"aegis, and around his head the bright goddess set a crown of a golden"
10188,BOOK XVIII.,"cloud, and kindled therefrom a blazing flame. And as when a smoke"
10189,BOOK XVIII.,"issueth from a city and riseth up into the upper air, from an island"
10190,BOOK XVIII.,"afar off that foes beleaguer, while the others from their city fight"
10191,BOOK XVIII.,"all day in hateful war,—but with the going down of the sun blaze out"
10192,BOOK XVIII.,"the beacon-fires in line, and high aloft rusheth up the glare for"
10193,BOOK XVIII.,"dwellers round about to behold, if haply they may come with ships to"
10194,BOOK XVIII.,help in need—thus from the head of Achilles soared that blaze toward
10195,BOOK XVIII.,"the heavens. And he went and stood beyond the wall beside the trench,"
10196,BOOK XVIII.,"yet mingled not among the Achaians, for he minded the wise bidding of"
10197,BOOK XVIII.,"his mother. There stood he and shouted aloud, and afar off Pallas"
10198,BOOK XVIII.,"Athene uttered her voice, and spread terror unspeakable among the men"
10199,BOOK XVIII.,of Troy. Clear as the voice of a clarion when it soundeth by reason of
10200,BOOK XVIII.,"slaughterous foemen that beleaguer a city, so clear rang forth the"
10201,BOOK XVIII.,"voice of Aiakides. And when they heard the brazen voice of Aiakides,"
10202,BOOK XVIII.,"the souls of all of them were dismayed, and the horses of goodly manes"
10203,BOOK XVIII.,"were fain to turn the chariots backward, for they boded anguish in"
10204,BOOK XVIII.,"their hearts, And the charioteers were amazed when they saw the"
10205,BOOK XVIII.,unwearying fire blaze fierce on the head of the great-hearted son of
10206,BOOK XVIII.,"Peleus, for the bright-eyed goddess Athene made it blaze. Thrice from"
10207,BOOK XVIII.,"over the trench shouted mightily noble Achilles, and thrice were the"
10208,BOOK XVIII.,men of Troy confounded and their proud allies. Yea there and then
10209,BOOK XVIII.,perished twelve men of their best by their own chariot wheels and
10210,BOOK XVIII.,spears. But the Achaians with joy drew Patroklos forth of the darts and
10211,BOOK XVIII.,"laid him on a litter, and his dear comrades stood around lamenting him;"
10212,BOOK XVIII.,"and among them followed fleet-footed Achilles, shedding hot tears, for"
10213,BOOK XVIII.,"his true comrade he saw lying on the bier, mangled by the keen bronze."
10214,BOOK XVIII.,"Him sent he forth with chariot and horses unto the battle, but home"
10215,BOOK XVIII.,again welcomed never more.
10216,BOOK XVIII.,
10217,BOOK XVIII.,Then Hera the ox-eyed queen sent down the unwearying Sun to be gone
10218,BOOK XVIII.,"unwillingly unto the streams of Ocean. So the Sun set, and the noble"
10219,BOOK XVIII.,Achaians made pause from the stress of battle and the hazardous war.
10220,BOOK XVIII.,
10221,BOOK XVIII.,But the Achaians all night made moan in lamentation for Patroklos. And
10222,BOOK XVIII.,"first of them in the loud lamentation was the son of Peleus, laying"
10223,BOOK XVIII.,upon the breast of his comrade his man-slaying hands and moaning very
10224,BOOK XVIII.,"sore, even as a deep-bearded lion whose whelps some stag-hunter hath"
10225,BOOK XVIII.,snatched away out of a deep wood; and the lion coming afterward
10226,BOOK XVIII.,grieveth and through many glens he rangeth on the track of the
10227,BOOK XVIII.,"footsteps of the man, if anywhere he might find him, for most bitter"
10228,BOOK XVIII.,anger seizeth him;—thus Achilles moaning heavily spake among the
10229,BOOK XVIII.,"Myrmidons: “Ay me, vain verily was the word I uttered on that day when"
10230,BOOK XVIII.,I cheered the hero Menoitios in his halls and said that I would bring
10231,BOOK XVIII.,back to Opoeis his son in glory from the sack of Ilios with the share
10232,BOOK XVIII.,of spoil that should fall unto him. Not all the purposes of men doth
10233,BOOK XVIII.,Zeus accomplish for them. It is appointed that both of us redden the
10234,BOOK XVIII.,"same earth with our blood here in Troy-land, for neither shall the old"
10235,BOOK XVIII.,"knight Peleus welcome me back home within his halls, nor my mother"
10236,BOOK XVIII.,"Thetis, but even here shall earth keep hold on me. Yet now, O"
10237,BOOK XVIII.,"Patroklos, since I follow thee under earth, I will not hold thy funeral"
10238,BOOK XVIII.,"till I have brought hither the armour and the head of Hector, thy"
10239,BOOK XVIII.,"high-hearted slayer, and before thy pyre I will cut the throats of"
10240,BOOK XVIII.,"twelve noble sons of the men of Troy, for mine anger thou art slain."
10241,BOOK XVIII.,"Till then beside the beaked ships shalt thou lie as thou art, and"
10242,BOOK XVIII.,"around thee deep-bosomed women, Trojan and Dardanian, shall mourn thee"
10243,BOOK XVIII.,"weeping night and day, even they whom we toiled to win by our strength"
10244,BOOK XVIII.,"and, our long spears when we sacked rich cities of mortal men.”"
10245,BOOK XVIII.,
10246,BOOK XVIII.,"Thus spake noble Achilles, and bade his comrades set a great tripod on"
10247,BOOK XVIII.,"the fire, that with all speed they might wash from Patroklos the bloody"
10248,BOOK XVIII.,"gore. So they set a tripod of ablution on the burning fire, and poured"
10249,BOOK XVIII.,therein water and took wood and kindled it beneath; and the fire
10250,BOOK XVIII.,"wrapped the belly of the tripod, and the water grew hot. And when the"
10251,BOOK XVIII.,"water boiled in the bright bronze, then washed they him and anointed"
10252,BOOK XVIII.,"with olive oil, and filled his wounds with fresh ointment, and laid him"
10253,BOOK XVIII.,"on a bier and covered him with soft cloth from head to foot, and"
10254,BOOK XVIII.,thereover a white robe. Then all night around Achilles fleet of foot
10255,BOOK XVIII.,the Myrmidons made lament and moan for Patroklos.
10256,BOOK XVIII.,
10257,BOOK XVIII.,Meanwhile Zeus spake unto Hera his sister and wife: “Thou hast
10258,BOOK XVIII.,"accomplished this, O Hera, ox-eyed queen, thou hast aroused Achilles"
10259,BOOK XVIII.,fleet of foot. Verily of thine own children must the flowing-haired
10260,BOOK XVIII.,Achaians be.”
10261,BOOK XVIII.,
10262,BOOK XVIII.,Then answered unto him Hera the ox-eyed queen: “Most dread son of
10263,BOOK XVIII.,"Kronos, what is this word thou hast said? Truly even a man, I ween, is"
10264,BOOK XVIII.,"to accomplish what he may for another man, albeit he is mortal and hath"
10265,BOOK XVIII.,not wisdom as we. How then was I who avow me the first of goddesses
10266,BOOK XVIII.,"both by birth and for that I am called thy wife, and thou art king"
10267,BOOK XVIII.,among all Immortals—how was I not in mine anger to devise evil against
10268,BOOK XVIII.,the men of Troy?”
10269,BOOK XVIII.,
10270,BOOK XVIII.,So debated they on this wise with one another. But Thetis of the silver
10271,BOOK XVIII.,"feet came unto the house of Hephaistos, imperishable, starlike, far"
10272,BOOK XVIII.,"seen among the dwellings of Immortals, a house of bronze, wrought by"
10273,BOOK XVIII.,the crook-footed god himself. Him found she sweating in toil and busy
10274,BOOK XVIII.,"about his bellows, for he was forging tripods twenty in all to stand"
10275,BOOK XVIII.,"around the wall of his stablished hall, and beneath the base of each he"
10276,BOOK XVIII.,"had set golden wheels, that of their own motion they might enter the"
10277,BOOK XVIII.,"assembly of the gods and again return unto his house, a marvel to look"
10278,BOOK XVIII.,upon. Thus much were they finished that not yet were away from the
10279,BOOK XVIII.,"fire, and gathered all his gear wherewith he worked into a silver"
10280,BOOK XVIII.,chest; and with a sponge he wiped his face and hands and sturdy neck
10281,BOOK XVIII.,"and shaggy breast, and did on his doublet, and took a stout staff and"
10282,BOOK XVIII.,went forth limping; but there were handmaidens of gold that moved to
10283,BOOK XVIII.,"help their lord, the semblances of living maids. In them is"
10284,BOOK XVIII.,"understanding at their hearts, in them are voice and strength, and they"
10285,BOOK XVIII.,"have skill of the immortal gods. These moved beneath their lord, and he"
10286,BOOK XVIII.,"gat him haltingly near to where Thetis was, and set him on a bright"
10287,BOOK XVIII.,"seat, and clasped her hand in his and spake and called her by her name:"
10288,BOOK XVIII.,"“Wherefore, long-robed Thetis, comest thou to our house, honoured that"
10289,BOOK XVIII.,thou art and dear? No frequent comer art thou hitherto. Speak what thou
10290,BOOK XVIII.,hast at heart; my soul is fain to accomplish it; if accomplish it I
10291,BOOK XVIII.,"can, and if it be appointed for accomplishment.”"
10292,BOOK XVIII.,
10293,BOOK XVIII.,"Then answered unto him Thetis shedding tears: “Hephaistos, hath there"
10294,BOOK XVIII.,verily been any of all goddesses in Olympus that hath endured so many
10295,BOOK XVIII.,grievous sorrows at heart as are the woes that Kronian Zeus hath laid
10296,BOOK XVIII.,upon me above all others? He chose me from among the sisters of the sea
10297,BOOK XVIII.,"to enthrall me to a man, even Peleus Aiakos’ son, and with a man I"
10298,BOOK XVIII.,endured wedlock sore against my will. Now lieth he in his halls
10299,BOOK XVIII.,"forspent with grievous age, but other griefs are mine. A son he gave me"
10300,BOOK XVIII.,"to bear and nourish, the chief of heroes, and he shot up like a young"
10301,BOOK XVIII.,branch. Like a plant in a very fruitful field I reared him and sent him
10302,BOOK XVIII.,"forth on beaked ships to Ilios to fight against the men of Troy, but"
10303,BOOK XVIII.,never again shall I welcome him back to his home within the house of
10304,BOOK XVIII.,Peleus. And while he yet liveth in my sight and beholdeth the light of
10305,BOOK XVIII.,"the sun, he sorroweth, neither can I help him any whit though I go unto"
10306,BOOK XVIII.,him. The maiden whom the sons of the Achaians chose out to be his
10307,BOOK XVIII.,"prize, her hath the lord Agamemnon taken back out of his hands. In"
10308,BOOK XVIII.,"grief for her wasted he his heart, while the men of Troy were driving"
10309,BOOK XVIII.,"the Achaians on their ships, nor suffered them to come forth. And the"
10310,BOOK XVIII.,"elders of the Argives entreated him, and told over many noble gifts."
10311,BOOK XVIII.,"Then albeit himself he refused to ward destruction from them, he put"
10312,BOOK XVIII.,"his armour on Patroklos and sent him to the war, and much people with"
10313,BOOK XVIII.,him. All day they fought around the Skaian gates and that same day had
10314,BOOK XVIII.,"sacked the town, but that when now Menoitios’ valiant son had wrought"
10315,BOOK XVIII.,"much harm, Apollo slew him in the forefront of the battle, and gave"
10316,BOOK XVIII.,"glory unto Hector. Therefore now come I a suppliant unto thy knees, if"
10317,BOOK XVIII.,"haply thou be willing to give my short-lived son shield and helmet, and"
10318,BOOK XVIII.,"goodly greaves fitted with ankle-pieces, and cuirass. For the armour"
10319,BOOK XVIII.,"that he had erst, his trusty comrade lost when he fell beneath the men"
10320,BOOK XVIII.,of Troy; and my son lieth on the earth with anguish in his soul.”
10321,BOOK XVIII.,
10322,BOOK XVIII.,Then made answer unto her the lame god of great renown: “Be of good
10323,BOOK XVIII.,"courage, let not these things trouble thy heart. Would that so might I"
10324,BOOK XVIII.,"avail to hide him far from dolorous death, when dread fate cometh upon"
10325,BOOK XVIII.,"him, as surely shall goodly armour be at his need, such as all men"
10326,BOOK XVIII.,"afterward shall marvel at, whatsoever may behold.”"
10327,BOOK XVIII.,
10328,BOOK XVIII.,Thus saying he left her there and went unto his bellows and turned them
10329,BOOK XVIII.,"upon the fire and bade them work. And the bellows, twenty in all, blew"
10330,BOOK XVIII.,"on the crucibles, sending deft blasts on every side, now to aid his"
10331,BOOK XVIII.,labour and now anon howsoever Hephaistos willed and the work went on.
10332,BOOK XVIII.,"And he threw bronze that weareth not into the fire, and tin and"
10333,BOOK XVIII.,"precious gold and silver, and next he set on an anvil-stand a great"
10334,BOOK XVIII.,"anvil, and took in his hand a sturdy hammer, and in the other he took"
10335,BOOK XVIII.,the tongs.
10336,BOOK XVIII.,
10337,BOOK XVIII.,"First fashioned he a shield great and strong, adorning it all over, and"
10338,BOOK XVIII.,"set thereto a shining rim, triple, bright-glancing, and therefrom a"
10339,BOOK XVIII.,silver baldric. Five were the folds of the shield itself; and therein
10340,BOOK XVIII.,fashioned he much cunning work from his wise heart.
10341,BOOK XVIII.,
10342,BOOK XVIII.,"There wrought he the earth, and the heavens, and the sea, and the"
10343,BOOK XVIII.,"unwearying sun, and the moon waxing to the full, and the signs every"
10344,BOOK XVIII.,"one wherewith the heavens are crowned, Pleiads and Hyads and Orion’s"
10345,BOOK XVIII.,"might, and the Bear that men call also the Wain, her that turneth in"
10346,BOOK XVIII.,"her place and watcheth Orion, and alone hath no part in the baths of"
10347,BOOK XVIII.,Ocean.
10348,BOOK XVIII.,
10349,BOOK XVIII.,Also he fashioned therein two fair cities of mortal men. In the one
10350,BOOK XVIII.,"were espousals and marriage feasts, and beneath the blaze of torches"
10351,BOOK XVIII.,"they were leading the brides from their chambers through the city, and"
10352,BOOK XVIII.,"loud arose the bridal song. And young men were whirling in the dance,"
10353,BOOK XVIII.,and among them flutes and viols sounded high; and women standing each
10354,BOOK XVIII.,at her door were marvelling. But the folk were gathered in the assembly
10355,BOOK XVIII.,"place; for there a strife was arisen, two men striving about the"
10356,BOOK XVIII.,"blood-price of a man slain; the one claimed to pay full atonement,"
10357,BOOK XVIII.,"expounding to the people, but the other denied him and would take"
10358,BOOK XVIII.,"naught. And the folk were cheering both, as they took part on either"
10359,BOOK XVIII.,"side. And heralds kept order among the folk, while the elders on"
10360,BOOK XVIII.,"polished stones were sitting in the sacred circle, and holding in their"
10361,BOOK XVIII.,hands staves from the loud-voiced heralds. Then before the people they
10362,BOOK XVIII.,rose up and gave judgment each in turn. And in the midst lay two
10363,BOOK XVIII.,"talents of gold, to be given unto him who should plead among them most"
10364,BOOK XVIII.,righteously.
10365,BOOK XVIII.,
10366,BOOK XVIII.,But around the other city were two armies in siege with glittering
10367,BOOK XVIII.,"arms. And two counsels found favour among them, either to sack the town"
10368,BOOK XVIII.,or to share all with the townsfolk even whatsoever substance the fair
10369,BOOK XVIII.,"city held within. But the besieged were not yet yielding, but arming"
10370,BOOK XVIII.,for an ambushment. On the wall there stood to guard it their dear wives
10371,BOOK XVIII.,"and infant children, and with these the old men; but the rest went"
10372,BOOK XVIII.,"forth, and their leaders were Ares and Pallas Athene, both wrought in"
10373,BOOK XVIII.,"gold, and golden was the vesture they had on. Goodly and great were"
10374,BOOK XVIII.,"they in their armour, even as gods, far seen around, and the folk at"
10375,BOOK XVIII.,their feet were smaller. And when they came where it seemed good to
10376,BOOK XVIII.,"them to lay ambush, in a river bed where there was a common"
10377,BOOK XVIII.,"watering-place of herds, there they set them, clad in glittering"
10378,BOOK XVIII.,bronze. And two scouts were posted by them afar off to spy the coming
10379,BOOK XVIII.,of flocks and of oxen with crooked horns. And presently came the
10380,BOOK XVIII.,"cattle, and with them two herdsmen playing on pipes, that took no"
10381,BOOK XVIII.,thought of the guile. Then the others when they beheld these ran upon
10382,BOOK XVIII.,them and quickly cut off the herds of oxen and fair flocks of white
10383,BOOK XVIII.,"sheep, and slew the shepherds withal. But the besiegers, as they sat"
10384,BOOK XVIII.,before the speech-places [from which the orators spoke] and heard much
10385,BOOK XVIII.,"din among the oxen, mounted forthwith behind their high-stepping"
10386,BOOK XVIII.,"horses, and came up with speed. Then they arrayed their battle and"
10387,BOOK XVIII.,"fought beside the river banks, and smote one another with bronze-shod"
10388,BOOK XVIII.,"spears. And among them mingled Strife and Tumult, and fell Death,"
10389,BOOK XVIII.,"grasping one man alive fresh-wounded, another without wound, and"
10390,BOOK XVIII.,dragging another dead through the mellay by the feet; and the raiment
10391,BOOK XVIII.,on her shoulders was red with the blood of men. Like living mortals
10392,BOOK XVIII.,"they hurled together and fought, and haled the corpses each of the"
10393,BOOK XVIII.,other’s slain.
10394,BOOK XVIII.,
10395,BOOK XVIII.,"Furthermore he set in the shield a soft fresh-ploughed field, rich"
10396,BOOK XVIII.,"tilth and wide, the third time ploughed; and many ploughers therein"
10397,BOOK XVIII.,drave their yokes to and fro as they wheeled about. Whensoever they
10398,BOOK XVIII.,"came to the boundary of the field and turned, then would a man come to"
10399,BOOK XVIII.,"each and give into his hands a goblet of sweet wine, while others would"
10400,BOOK XVIII.,"be turning back along the furrows, fain to reach the boundary of the"
10401,BOOK XVIII.,deep tilth. And the field grew black behind and seemed as it were
10402,BOOK XVIII.,"a-ploughing, albeit of gold, for this was the great marvel of the work."
10403,BOOK XVIII.,
10404,BOOK XVIII.,"Furthermore he set therein the demesne-land of a king, where hinds were"
10405,BOOK XVIII.,reaping with sharp sickles in their hands. Some armfuls along the
10406,BOOK XVIII.,"swathe were falling in rows to the earth, whilst others the"
10407,BOOK XVIII.,sheaf-binders were binding in twisted bands of straw. Three
10408,BOOK XVIII.,"sheaf-binders stood over them, while behind boys gathering corn and"
10409,BOOK XVIII.,bearing it in their arms gave it constantly to the binders; and among
10410,BOOK XVIII.,"them the king in silence was standing at the swathe with his staff,"
10411,BOOK XVIII.,rejoicing in his heart. And henchmen apart beneath an oak were making
10412,BOOK XVIII.,"ready a feast, and preparing a great ox they had sacrificed; while the"
10413,BOOK XVIII.,women were strewing much white barley to be a supper for the hinds.
10414,BOOK XVIII.,
10415,BOOK XVIII.,"Also he set therein a vineyard teeming plenteously with clusters,"
10416,BOOK XVIII.,"wrought fair in gold; black were the grapes, but the vines hung"
10417,BOOK XVIII.,"throughout on silver poles. And around it he ran a ditch of cyanus, and"
10418,BOOK XVIII.,"round that a fence of tin; and one single pathway led to it, whereby"
10419,BOOK XVIII.,the vintagers might go when they should gather the vintage. And maidens
10420,BOOK XVIII.,and striplings in childish glee bare the sweet fruit in plaited
10421,BOOK XVIII.,baskets. And in the midst of them a boy made pleasant music on a
10422,BOOK XVIII.,"clear-toned viol, and sang thereto a sweet Linos-song [probably a"
10423,BOOK XVIII.,lament for departing summer] with delicate voice; while the rest with
10424,BOOK XVIII.,feet falling together kept time with the music and song.
10425,BOOK XVIII.,
10426,BOOK XVIII.,"Also he wrought therein a herd of kine with upright horns, and the kine"
10427,BOOK XVIII.,"were fashioned of gold and tin, and with lowing they hurried from the"
10428,BOOK XVIII.,"byre to pasture beside a murmuring river, beside the waving reed. And"
10429,BOOK XVIII.,"herdsmen of gold were following with the kine, four of them, and nine"
10430,BOOK XVIII.,dogs fleet of foot came after them. But two terrible lions among the
10431,BOOK XVIII.,foremost kine had seized a loud-roaring bull that bellowed mightily as
10432,BOOK XVIII.,"they haled him, and the dogs and the young men sped after him. The"
10433,BOOK XVIII.,lions rending the great bull’s hide were devouring his vitals and his
10434,BOOK XVIII.,black blood; while the herdsmen in vain tarred on their fleet dogs to
10435,BOOK XVIII.,"set on, for they shrank from biting the lions but stood hard by and"
10436,BOOK XVIII.,barked and swerved away.
10437,BOOK XVIII.,
10438,BOOK XVIII.,"Also the glorious lame god wrought therein a pasture in a fair glen, a"
10439,BOOK XVIII.,"great pasture of white sheep, and a steading, and roofed huts, and"
10440,BOOK XVIII.,folds.
10441,BOOK XVIII.,
10442,BOOK XVIII.,Also did the glorious lame god devise a dancing-place like unto that
10443,BOOK XVIII.,which once in wide Knosos Daidalos wrought for Ariadne of the lovely
10444,BOOK XVIII.,"tresses. There were youths dancing and maidens of costly wooing, their"
10445,BOOK XVIII.,"hands upon one another’s wrists. Fine linen the maidens had on, and the"
10446,BOOK XVIII.,youths well-woven doublets faintly glistening with oil. Fair wreaths
10447,BOOK XVIII.,"had the maidens, and the youths daggers of gold hanging from silver"
10448,BOOK XVIII.,baldrics. And now would they run round with deft feet exceeding
10449,BOOK XVIII.,"lightly, as when a potter sitting by his wheel that fitteth between his"
10450,BOOK XVIII.,hands maketh trial of it whether it run: and now anon they would run in
10451,BOOK XVIII.,lines to meet each other. And a great company stood round the lovely
10452,BOOK XVIII.,"dance in joy; and through the midst of them, leading the measure, two"
10453,BOOK XVIII.,tumblers whirled.
10454,BOOK XVIII.,
10455,BOOK XVIII.,Also he set therein the great might of the River of Ocean around the
10456,BOOK XVIII.,uttermost rim of the cunningly-fashioned shield.
10457,BOOK XVIII.,
10458,BOOK XVIII.,"Now when he had wrought the shield great and strong, then wrought he"
10459,BOOK XVIII.,"him a corslet brighter than a flame of fire, and he wrought him a"
10460,BOOK XVIII.,"massive helmet to fit his brows, goodly and graven, and set thereon a"
10461,BOOK XVIII.,"crest of gold, and he wrought him greaves of pliant tin."
10462,BOOK XVIII.,
10463,BOOK XVIII.,"So when the renowned lame god had finished all the armour, he took and"
10464,BOOK XVIII.,laid it before the mother of Achilles. Then she like a falcon sprang
10465,BOOK XVIII.,"down from snowy Olympus, bearing from Hephaistos the glittering arms."
10466,BOOK XVIII.,
10467,BOOK XVIII.,
10468,BOOK XVIII.,
10469,BOOK XVIII.,
10470,BOOK XIX.,BOOK XIX.
10471,BOOK XIX.,
10472,BOOK XIX.,
10473,BOOK XIX.,How Achilles and Agamemnon were reconciled before the assembly of the
10474,BOOK XIX.,"Achaians, and Achilles went forth with them to battle."
10475,BOOK XIX.,
10476,BOOK XIX.,
10477,BOOK XIX.,Now Morning saffron-robed arose from the streams of Ocean to bring
10478,BOOK XIX.,"light to gods and men, and Thetis came to the ships, bearing his gift"
10479,BOOK XIX.,from the god. Her dear son she found fallen about Patroklos and
10480,BOOK XIX.,uttering loud lament; and round him many of his company made moan. And
10481,BOOK XIX.,"the bright goddess stood beside him in their midst, and clasped her"
10482,BOOK XIX.,"hand in his and spake and called upon his name: “My child, him who"
10483,BOOK XIX.,"lieth here we must let be, for all our pain, for by the will of gods"
10484,BOOK XIX.,from the beginning was he brought low. But thou take from Hephaistos
10485,BOOK XIX.,"arms of pride, arms passing goodly, such as no man on his shoulders yet"
10486,BOOK XIX.,hath borne.”
10487,BOOK XIX.,
10488,BOOK XIX.,"Thus spake the goddess and in front of Aehifies laid the arms, and they"
10489,BOOK XIX.,"rang all again in their glory. And awe fell on all the Myrmidons, nor"
10490,BOOK XIX.,"dared any to gaze thereon, for they were awe-stricken. But when"
10491,BOOK XIX.,"Achilles looked thereon, then came fury upon him the more, and his eyes"
10492,BOOK XIX.,blazed terribly forth as it were a flame beneath their lids: glad was
10493,BOOK XIX.,he as he held in his hands that splendid gift of a god. But when he had
10494,BOOK XIX.,"satisfied his soul in gazing on the glory of the arms, straightway to"
10495,BOOK XIX.,"his mother spake he winged words: “My mother, the arms the god has"
10496,BOOK XIX.,"given are such as it beseemeth that the work of Immortals should be,"
10497,BOOK XIX.,and that no mortal man should have wrought. Now therefore will I arm me
10498,BOOK XIX.,"in them, but I have grievous fear lest meantime on the gashed wounds of"
10499,BOOK XIX.,"Menoitios’ valiant son flies light and breed worms therein, and defile"
10500,BOOK XIX.,his corpse—for the life is slain out of him—and so all his flesh shall
10501,BOOK XIX.,rot.”
10502,BOOK XIX.,
10503,BOOK XIX.,"Then answered him Thetis, goddess of the silver feet: “Child, have no"
10504,BOOK XIX.,care for this within thy mind. I will see to ward from him the cruel
10505,BOOK XIX.,tribes of flies which prey on men slain in fight: for even though he
10506,BOOK XIX.,"lie till a whole year’s course be run, yet his flesh shall be sound"
10507,BOOK XIX.,"continually, or better even than now. But call thou the Achaian"
10508,BOOK XIX.,"warriors to the place of assembly, and unsay thy wrath against"
10509,BOOK XIX.,"Agamemnon shepherd of the host, and then arm swiftly for battle, and"
10510,BOOK XIX.,clothe thee with thy strength.”
10511,BOOK XIX.,
10512,BOOK XIX.,"Thus saying she filled him with adventurous might, while on Patroklos"
10513,BOOK XIX.,"she shed ambrosia and red nectar through his nostrils, that his flesh"
10514,BOOK XIX.,might abide the same continually.
10515,BOOK XIX.,
10516,BOOK XIX.,"But noble Achilles went down the beach of the sea, crying his terrible"
10517,BOOK XIX.,"cry, and roused the Achaian warriors. And they who before were wont to"
10518,BOOK XIX.,"abide in the circle of the ships, and they who were helmsmen and kept"
10519,BOOK XIX.,"the steerage of the ships, or were stewards there and dealt out food,"
10520,BOOK XIX.,"even these came then to the place of assembly, because Achilles was"
10521,BOOK XIX.,"come forth, after long ceasing from grievous war. Limping came two of"
10522,BOOK XIX.,"Ares’ company, Tydeus’ son staunch in fight and noble Odysseus, each"
10523,BOOK XIX.,"leaning on his spear, for their wounds were grievous still; and they"
10524,BOOK XIX.,went and sate them down in the forefront of the assembly. And last came
10525,BOOK XIX.,"Agamemnon king of men, with his wound upon him, for him too in the"
10526,BOOK XIX.,stress of battle Kooen Antenor’s son had wounded with his bronze-tipped
10527,BOOK XIX.,"spear. But when all the Achaians were gathered, then uprose"
10528,BOOK XIX.,"fleet-footed Achilles and spake in their midst: “Son of Atreus, was"
10529,BOOK XIX.,"this in any wise the better way for both thee and me, what time with"
10530,BOOK XIX.,grief at our hearts we waxed fierce in soul-devouring strife for the
10531,BOOK XIX.,sake of a girl? Would that Artemis had slain her with her arrow at the
10532,BOOK XIX.,"ships, on the day whereon I took her to me, when I had spoiled"
10533,BOOK XIX.,Lyrnessos; so should not then so many Achaians have bitten the wide
10534,BOOK XIX.,"earth beneath their enemies’ hands, by reason of my exceeding wrath. It"
10535,BOOK XIX.,"hath been well for Hector and the Trojans, but the Achaians I think"
10536,BOOK XIX.,shall long remember the strife that was betwixt thee and me. But
10537,BOOK XIX.,"bygones will we let be, for all our pain, and curb under necessity the"
10538,BOOK XIX.,spirit within our breasts. I now will stay my anger: it beseems me not
10539,BOOK XIX.,implacably for ever to be wroth; but come rouse speedily to the fight
10540,BOOK XIX.,"the flowing-haired Achaians, that I may go forth against the men of"
10541,BOOK XIX.,"Troy and put them yet again to the proof, if they be fain to couch hard"
10542,BOOK XIX.,by the ships. Methinks that some among them shall be glad to rest their
10543,BOOK XIX.,"knees when they are fled out of the fierceness of the battle, and from"
10544,BOOK XIX.,before our spear.”
10545,BOOK XIX.,
10546,BOOK XIX.,"He spake, and the well-greaved Achaians rejoiced that the great-hearted"
10547,BOOK XIX.,son of Peleus had made renouncement of his wrath. Then among them spake
10548,BOOK XIX.,"Agamemnon king of men, speaking from the place where he sat, not arisen"
10549,BOOK XIX.,"to stand forth in their midst: “O Danaan friends and heroes, men of"
10550,BOOK XIX.,"Ares’ company, seemly is it to listen to him who standeth up to speak,"
10551,BOOK XIX.,nor behoveth it to break in upon his words: even toward a skilled man
10552,BOOK XIX.,"that were hard. For amid the uproar of many men how should one listen,"
10553,BOOK XIX.,or yet speak? even the clearest-voiced speech is marred. To the son of
10554,BOOK XIX.,"Peleus I will declare myself, but ye other Argives give heed, and each"
10555,BOOK XIX.,"mark well my word. Oft have the Achaians spoken thus to me, and"
10556,BOOK XIX.,"upbraided me; but it is not I who am the cause, but Zeus and Destiny"
10557,BOOK XIX.,"and Erinys that walketh in the darkness, who put into my soul fierce"
10558,BOOK XIX.,"madness on the day when in the assembly I, even I, bereft Achilles of"
10559,BOOK XIX.,his meed. What could I do? it is God who accomplisheth all. Eldest
10560,BOOK XIX.,"daughter of Zeus is Ate who blindeth all, a power of bane: delicate are"
10561,BOOK XIX.,"her feet, for not upon the earth she goeth, but walketh over the heads"
10562,BOOK XIX.,"of men, making men fall; and entangleth this one or that. Ye even Zeus"
10563,BOOK XIX.,"was blinded upon a time, he who they say is greatest among gods and"
10564,BOOK XIX.,"men; yet even him Hera with a female wile deceived, on the day when"
10565,BOOK XIX.,Alkmene in fair-crowned Thebes was to bring forth the strength of
10566,BOOK XIX.,Herakles. For then proclaimed he solemnly among the gods: ‘Here me ye
10567,BOOK XIX.,"all, both gods and goddesses, while I utter the council of my soul"
10568,BOOK XIX.,"within my heart. This day shall Eileithuia, the help of travailing"
10569,BOOK XIX.,"women, bring to the light a man who shall be lord over all that dwell"
10570,BOOK XIX.,"round about, among the raise of men who are sprung of me by blood.’ And"
10571,BOOK XIX.,to him in subtlety queen Hera spake: ‘Though wilt play the cheat and
10572,BOOK XIX.,"not accomplish thy word. Come now, Olympian, swear me a firm oath that"
10573,BOOK XIX.,verily and indeed shall that man be lord over all that dwell round
10574,BOOK XIX.,"about, who this day shall fall between a woman’s feet, even he among"
10575,BOOK XIX.,"all men who are of the lineage of thy blood.’ So spake she, and Zeus no"
10576,BOOK XIX.,"wise perceived her subtlety but sware a mighty oath, and therewith was"
10577,BOOK XIX.,he sore blinded. For Hera darted from Olympus’ peak and came swiftly to
10578,BOOK XIX.,"Achaian Argus, were she knew was the stately wife of Sthenelos son of"
10579,BOOK XIX.,"Perseus, who was also great with child, and her seventh month had come."
10580,BOOK XIX.,"Her son Hera brought to the light, though his tale of months was"
10581,BOOK XIX.,"untold, but she stayed Alkmene’s bearing and kept the Eileithuiai from"
10582,BOOK XIX.,her aid. Then she brought the tidings herself and to Kronos’ son Zeus
10583,BOOK XIX.,"she spake: ‘Father Zeus of the bright lightning, a word will I speak to"
10584,BOOK XIX.,thee for my heed. Today is born a man of valor who shall rule among the
10585,BOOK XIX.,"Archives, Eurystheus, son of Sthenelos the son of Perseus, of thy"
10586,BOOK XIX.,"lineage; not unmeet is it that he be lord among Argives.’ She said, but"
10587,BOOK XIX.,"sharp pain smote him in the depths of his soul, and straightway he"
10588,BOOK XIX.,"seized Ate by her bright-haired head in the anger of his soul, and"
10589,BOOK XIX.,sware a mighty oath that never again to Olympus and the starry heaven
10590,BOOK XIX.,"should Ate come, who blindeth all alike. He said, and whirling her in"
10591,BOOK XIX.,"his hand flung her from the starry heaven, and quickly came she down"
10592,BOOK XIX.,among the works of men. Yet ever he groaned against her when he beheld
10593,BOOK XIX.,"his beloved son in cruel travail at Eurystheus’ hest. Thus also I, what"
10594,BOOK XIX.,time great Hector of the glancing helm was slaying Argives at the
10595,BOOK XIX.,"sterns of our ships, could not be unmindful of Ate, who blinded me at"
10596,BOOK XIX.,"the first. But since thus blinded was I, and Zeus bereft me of my wit,"
10597,BOOK XIX.,"fain am I to make amends, and recompense manifold for the wrong. Only"
10598,BOOK XIX.,arise thou to the battle and rouse the rest of the host. Gifts am I
10599,BOOK XIX.,"ready to offer, even all that noble Odysseus went yesterday to promise"
10600,BOOK XIX.,"in thy hut. So, if thou wilt, stay awhile, though eager, from battle,"
10601,BOOK XIX.,"and squires shall take the gifts from my ship and carry them to thee,"
10602,BOOK XIX.,that thou mayest see that what I give sufficeth thee.”
10603,BOOK XIX.,
10604,BOOK XIX.,"Then answered him Achilles swift of foot: “Most noble son of Atreus,"
10605,BOOK XIX.,"Agamemnon king of men, for the gifts, to give them as it beseemeth, if"
10606,BOOK XIX.,"so thou wilt, or to withhold, is in thy choice. But now let us bethink"
10607,BOOK XIX.,us of battle with all speed; this is no time to dally here with
10608,BOOK XIX.,"subtleties, for a great work is yet undone. Once more must Achilles be"
10609,BOOK XIX.,"seen in the forefront of the battle, laying waste with his brazen spear"
10610,BOOK XIX.,the battalions of the men of Troy. Thereof let each of you think as he
10611,BOOK XIX.,fighteth with his man.”
10612,BOOK XIX.,
10613,BOOK XIX.,"Then Odysseus of many counsels answered him and said: “Nay yet, for all"
10614,BOOK XIX.,"thy valour, godlike Achilles, not against Ilios lead thou the sons of"
10615,BOOK XIX.,"Achaians fasting to fight the men of Troy, since not of short spell"
10616,BOOK XIX.,"shall the battle be, when once the ranks of men are met, and God shall"
10617,BOOK XIX.,breathe valour into both. But bid the Achaians taste at the swift ships
10618,BOOK XIX.,food and wine; for thence is vigour and might. For no man fasting from
10619,BOOK XIX.,food shall be able to fight with the foe all day till the going down of
10620,BOOK XIX.,the sun; for though his spirit be eager for battle yet his limbs
10621,BOOK XIX.,"unaware grow weary, and thirst besetteth him, and hunger, and his knees"
10622,BOOK XIX.,in his going fail. But the man who having his fill of food and wine
10623,BOOK XIX.,"fighteth thus all day against the enemy, his heart is of good cheer"
10624,BOOK XIX.,"within him, nor anywise tire his limbs, ere all give back from battle."
10625,BOOK XIX.,"So come, disperse the host and bid them make ready their meal. And the"
10626,BOOK XIX.,gifts let Agamemnon king of men bring forth into the midst of the
10627,BOOK XIX.,"assembly, that all Achaians may behold them with their eyes, and thou"
10628,BOOK XIX.,"be glad at heart. And let him swear to thee an oath, standing in the"
10629,BOOK XIX.,"midst of the Argives, that he hath never gone up into the damsel’s bed"
10630,BOOK XIX.,"or lain with her, [O prince, as is the wont of man with woman]; and let"
10631,BOOK XIX.,thine own spirit be placable within thy breast. Then let him make thee
10632,BOOK XIX.,"a rich feast of reconcilement in his hut, that thou have nothing"
10633,BOOK XIX.,"lacking of thy right. And thou, son of Atreus, toward others also shalt"
10634,BOOK XIX.,be more righteous hereafter; for no shame it is that a man that is a
10635,BOOK XIX.,king should make amends if he have been the first to deal violently.”
10636,BOOK XIX.,
10637,BOOK XIX.,"Then to him spake Agamemnon king of men: “Son of Laertes, I rejoice to"
10638,BOOK XIX.,listen to thy speech; for rightfully hast thou told over all. And the
10639,BOOK XIX.,"oath I am willing to swear, yea my heart biddeth it, nor will I"
10640,BOOK XIX.,"forswear myself before God. Let Achilles abide for a space, eager for"
10641,BOOK XIX.,"battle though he be, and all ye others abide together, until the gifts"
10642,BOOK XIX.,"come forth from my hut, and we make faithful oath with sacrifice. But"
10643,BOOK XIX.,"thee thyself I thus charge and bid. Choose thee young men, princes of"
10644,BOOK XIX.,"the Achaian folk, and bear my gifts from my ship, even all that we"
10645,BOOK XIX.,"promised yesterday to Achilles, and take with thee the women. And let"
10646,BOOK XIX.,Talthybios speedily make me ready a boar-swine in the midst of the wide
10647,BOOK XIX.,"Achaian host, to sacrifice to Zeus and to the Sun.”"
10648,BOOK XIX.,
10649,BOOK XIX.,And to him in answer swift-footed Achilles spake: “Most noble son of
10650,BOOK XIX.,"Atreus, Agamemnon king of men, at some other time were it even better"
10651,BOOK XIX.,"ye should be busied thus, when haply there shall be some pause of war,"
10652,BOOK XIX.,and the spirit within my breast shall be less fierce. But now they lie
10653,BOOK XIX.,"mangled on the field—even they whom Hector son of Priam slew, when Zeus"
10654,BOOK XIX.,gave him glory—and ye call men to their food. Verily for my part I
10655,BOOK XIX.,"would bid the sons of the Achaians to fight now unfed and fasting, and"
10656,BOOK XIX.,"with the setting sun make ready a mighty meal, when we shall have"
10657,BOOK XIX.,avenged the shame. Till then down my throat at least nor food nor drink
10658,BOOK XIX.,"shall go, since my comrade is dead, who in my hut is lying mangled by"
10659,BOOK XIX.,"the sharp spear, with his feet toward the door, and round him our"
10660,BOOK XIX.,"comrades mourn, wherefore in my heart to no thought of those matters,"
10661,BOOK XIX.,"but of slaying, and blood, and grievous moans of men.”"
10662,BOOK XIX.,
10663,BOOK XIX.,"Then answered him Odysseus of many counsels: “O Achilles, Peleus’ son,"
10664,BOOK XIX.,"mightiest of Achaians far, better and mightier not a little art thou"
10665,BOOK XIX.,"than I with the spear, but in counsel I may surpass thee greatly, since"
10666,BOOK XIX.,I was born first and know more things: wherefore let thy heart endure
10667,BOOK XIX.,"to listen to my speech. Quickly have men surfeit of battle, of that"
10668,BOOK XIX.,"wherein the sword streweth most straw yet is the harvest scantiest,"
10669,BOOK XIX.,"[i.e., in a pitched battle there is little plunder, the hope of which"
10670,BOOK XIX.,might help to sustain men’s efforts in storming a town] when Zeus
10671,BOOK XIX.,"inclineth his balance, who is disposer of the wars of men. But it"
10672,BOOK XIX.,cannot be that the Achaians fast to mourn a corpse; for exceeding many
10673,BOOK XIX.,and thick fall such on every day; when then should there be rest from
10674,BOOK XIX.,"toil? Nay, it behoveth to bury him who is dead, steeling our hearts,"
10675,BOOK XIX.,when once we have wept him for a day; but such as are left alive from
10676,BOOK XIX.,"hateful war must take thought of meat and drink, that yet more against"
10677,BOOK XIX.,"our foes we may fight relentlessly ever, clad in unyielding bronze."
10678,BOOK XIX.,Then let none of the host hold back awaiting other summons; this is the
10679,BOOK XIX.,"summons, and ill shall it be for whoso is left behind at the Argive"
10680,BOOK XIX.,ships; but all together as one we will rouse against the horse-taming
10681,BOOK XIX.,Trojans the fury of war.”
10682,BOOK XIX.,
10683,BOOK XIX.,"He spoke, and took with him the sons of noble Nestor, and Meges son of"
10684,BOOK XIX.,"Phyleus, and Thoas, and Meriones, and Lykomedes son of Kreiontes, and"
10685,BOOK XIX.,"Melanippos. And they went on their way to the hut of Agamemnon, Atreus’"
10686,BOOK XIX.,son. Forthwith as the word was spoken so was the deed done. Seven
10687,BOOK XIX.,"tripods they bare from the hut, as he promised him, and twenty bright"
10688,BOOK XIX.,"caldrons, and twelve horses, and anon they led forth women skilled in"
10689,BOOK XIX.,"goodly arts, seven, and the eighth was fair-faced Briseis. Then"
10690,BOOK XIX.,"Odysseus, having weighed ten talents of gold in all, led the way, and"
10691,BOOK XIX.,with him young men of the Achaians bare the gifts. These they set in
10692,BOOK XIX.,"the midst of the place of assembly, and Agamemnon rose up, and beside"
10693,BOOK XIX.,"that shepherd of the host stood Talthybios, whose voice was like a"
10694,BOOK XIX.,"god’s, and held a boar between his hands. And the son of Atreus drawing"
10695,BOOK XIX.,"with his hands his knife, which ever hung beside the mighty scabbard of"
10696,BOOK XIX.,"his sword, cut off the first hairs from the boar, and lifting up his"
10697,BOOK XIX.,"hands he prayed to Zeus, and all the Argives sat silent in their"
10698,BOOK XIX.,"places, duly hearkening to the king. And he prayed aloud, looking up to"
10699,BOOK XIX.,"the wide heaven: “Be Zeus before all witness, highest and best of the"
10700,BOOK XIX.,"gods, and Earth, and Sun, and Erinyes, who under earth take vengeance"
10701,BOOK XIX.,"upon men, whosoever for-sweareth himself, that never have I laid hand"
10702,BOOK XIX.,"on the damsel Briseis, neither to lie with her nor anywise else, but"
10703,BOOK XIX.,she has abode untouched within my huts. And if aught that I swear be
10704,BOOK XIX.,"false, may the gods give me all sorrows manifold, that they send on him"
10705,BOOK XIX.,who sinneth against them in his oath.”
10706,BOOK XIX.,
10707,BOOK XIX.,"He said, and cut the boar’s throat with the pitiless knife. And the"
10708,BOOK XIX.,"body Taithybios whirled and threw into the great wash of the hoary sea,"
10709,BOOK XIX.,to be the food of fishes; but Achilles arose up and spake in the midst
10710,BOOK XIX.,"of the warrior Argives: “Father Zeus, sore madness dealest thou verily"
10711,BOOK XIX.,to men. Never could the son of Atreus have stirred the soul within my
10712,BOOK XIX.,"breast, nor led off the damsel implacably against my will, had not Zeus"
10713,BOOK XIX.,willed that on many of the Achaians death should come. But now go forth
10714,BOOK XIX.,"to your meal, that we may join battle thereupon.”"
10715,BOOK XIX.,
10716,BOOK XIX.,Thus he spake and dispersed the assembly with all speed. The rest were
10717,BOOK XIX.,"scattered each to his own ship, but the great-hearted Myrmidons took up"
10718,BOOK XIX.,"the gifts, and bare them to the ship of godlike Achilles. And they laid"
10719,BOOK XIX.,"them in the huts and set the women there, and gallant squires drave the"
10720,BOOK XIX.,horses among their troop.
10721,BOOK XIX.,
10722,BOOK XIX.,"But Briseis that was like unto golden Aphrodite, when she beheld"
10723,BOOK XIX.,"Patroklos mangled by the keen spear, fell about him and made shrill"
10724,BOOK XIX.,"lament, and tore with her hands her breast and tender neck, and"
10725,BOOK XIX.,"beautiful face. And she spake amid her weeping, that woman like unto"
10726,BOOK XIX.,"goddesses: “Patroklos, dearest to my hapless heart, alive I left thee"
10727,BOOK XIX.,"when I left this hut, but now, O prince of the people, I am come back"
10728,BOOK XIX.,"to find thee dead; thus evil ever followeth evil in my lot. My husband,"
10729,BOOK XIX.,"unto whom my father and lady mother gave me, I beheld before our city"
10730,BOOK XIX.,"mangled with the keen spear, and my three brothers whom my own mother"
10731,BOOK XIX.,"bore, my near and dear, who all met their day of doom. But thou, when"
10732,BOOK XIX.,"swift Achilles slew my husband and wasted godlike Mynes’ city, wouldest"
10733,BOOK XIX.,"ever that I should not even weep, and saidest that thou wouldst make me"
10734,BOOK XIX.,"godlike Achilles’ wedded wife, and that ye would take me in your ships"
10735,BOOK XIX.,to Phthia and make me a marriage feast among the Myrmidons. Therefore
10736,BOOK XIX.,"with all my soul I mourn thy death, for thou wert ever kind.”"
10737,BOOK XIX.,
10738,BOOK XIX.,"Thus spake she weeping, and thereon the women wailed, in semblance for"
10739,BOOK XIX.,"Patroklos, but each for her own woe. But round Achilles gathered the"
10740,BOOK XIX.,"elders of the Achaians, praying him that he would eat; but he denied"
10741,BOOK XIX.,"them with a groan: “I pray you, if any kind comrade will hearken to me,"
10742,BOOK XIX.,"bid me not sate my heart with meat and drink, since terrible grief is"
10743,BOOK XIX.,"come upon me. Till the sun go down I will abide, and endure continually"
10744,BOOK XIX.,until then.”
10745,BOOK XIX.,
10746,BOOK XIX.,"He spoke, and his speech made the other chiefs depart, but the two sons"
10747,BOOK XIX.,"of Atreus stayed, and noble Odysseus, and Nestor and Idomeneus and"
10748,BOOK XIX.,"Phoinox, ancient knight, soothing him in his exceeding sorrow, but he"
10749,BOOK XIX.,could no whit be soothed until he had entered the mouth of bloody war.
10750,BOOK XIX.,"And bethinking him he sighed very heavily and spake aloud: “Thou too, O"
10751,BOOK XIX.,"hapless, dearest of my friends, thyself wouldst verily of yore set"
10752,BOOK XIX.,"forth in out hut with ready speed a savoury meal, what time the"
10753,BOOK XIX.,Achaians hasted to wage against the horse-taming Trojans dolorous war.
10754,BOOK XIX.,"But now thou liest mangled, and my heart will none of meat and drink,"
10755,BOOK XIX.,"that stand within, for desire of thee. Nought worse than this could I"
10756,BOOK XIX.,"endure, not though I should hear of my father’s death, who now I ween"
10757,BOOK XIX.,"in Phthia is shedding big tears for lack of a son so dear, even me that"
10758,BOOK XIX.,in an alien land for sake of baleful Helen do battle with the men of
10759,BOOK XIX.,Troy; nor though it were my beloved son who is reared for me in Skyros
10760,BOOK XIX.,(if still at least is godlike Neoptolemos alive). For hitherto had my
10761,BOOK XIX.,soul within me trusted that I alone should perish far from
10762,BOOK XIX.,"horse-pasturing Argos, here in the Trojan land, but that thou shouldest"
10763,BOOK XIX.,"return to Phthia, so that thou mightest take me the child in thy swift"
10764,BOOK XIX.,black ship from Skyros and show him everything—my substance and
10765,BOOK XIX.,"servants, and high-roofed mighty hall. For Peleus I ween already must"
10766,BOOK XIX.,"be dead and gone, or else in feeble life he hath sorrow of age, and of"
10767,BOOK XIX.,"waiting ever for bitter news of me, till he hear that I am dead.”"
10768,BOOK XIX.,
10769,BOOK XIX.,"Thus spake he weeping, and the elders mourned with him, bethinking them"
10770,BOOK XIX.,what each had left at home. And when the son of Kronos beheld them
10771,BOOK XIX.,"sorrowing he pitied them, and forthwith to Athene spake he winged"
10772,BOOK XIX.,"words: “My child, thou hast then left utterly the man of thy heart."
10773,BOOK XIX.,Hath Achilles then no longer a place within thy thought? He before the
10774,BOOK XIX.,steep-prowed ships sits mourning his dear comrade; the rest are gone to
10775,BOOK XIX.,"their meal, but he is fasting and unfed. But go, distil into his breast"
10776,BOOK XIX.,"nectar and pleasant ambrosia, that no pains of hunger come on him.”"
10777,BOOK XIX.,
10778,BOOK XIX.,"Thus saying he sped forward Athene who before was fain. And she, like a"
10779,BOOK XIX.,"falcon wide-winged and shrill-voiced, hurled herself forth from heaven"
10780,BOOK XIX.,through the upper air. So while the Achaians were arming presently
10781,BOOK XIX.,"throughout the camp, she in Achilles’ breast distilled nectar and"
10782,BOOK XIX.,"pleasant ambrosia, that grievous hunger might not assail his knees, and"
10783,BOOK XIX.,then herself was gone to the firm house of her mighty father. Then the
10784,BOOK XIX.,Achaians poured forth from the swift ships. As when thick snowflakes
10785,BOOK XIX.,"flutter down from Zeus, chill beneath the blast of Boreas born in the"
10786,BOOK XIX.,"upper air, so thick from the ships streamed forth bright glittering"
10787,BOOK XIX.,"helms and bossy shields, strong-plaited cuirasses and ashen spears. And"
10788,BOOK XIX.,the sheen thereof went up to heaven and all the earth around laughed in
10789,BOOK XIX.,"the flash of bronze, and there went a sound beneath the feet of the"
10790,BOOK XIX.,"men, and in the midst of them noble Achilles harnessed him. His teeth"
10791,BOOK XIX.,"gnashed together, and his eyes blazed as it were the flame of a fire,"
10792,BOOK XIX.,for into his heart was intolerable anguish entered in. Thus wroth
10793,BOOK XIX.,"against the men of Troy he put on the gift of the god, which Hephaistos"
10794,BOOK XIX.,wrought him by his art. First on his legs he set the fair greaves
10795,BOOK XIX.,"fitted with silver ankle-pieces, and next he donned the cuirass about"
10796,BOOK XIX.,his breast. Then round his shoulders he slung the bronze sword
10797,BOOK XIX.,"silver-studded; then lastly he took the great and strong shield, and"
10798,BOOK XIX.,its brightness shone afar off as the moon’s. Or as when over the sea
10799,BOOK XIX.,"there appeareth to sailors the brightness of a burning fire, and it"
10800,BOOK XIX.,burneth on high among the mountains in some lonely steading—sailors
10801,BOOK XIX.,"whom storm-blasts bear unwilling over the sea, the home of fishes, afar"
10802,BOOK XIX.,from them they love:— so from Achilles’ goodly well-dight shield the
10803,BOOK XIX.,brightness thereof shot up toward heaven. And he lifted the stout
10804,BOOK XIX.,"helmet and set it on his head, and like a star it shone, the horse-hair"
10805,BOOK XIX.,"crested helmet, and around it waved plumes of gold that Hephaistos had"
10806,BOOK XIX.,set thick about the crest. Then noble Achilles proved him in his armour
10807,BOOK XIX.,"to know whether it fitted unto him, and whether his glorious limbs ran"
10808,BOOK XIX.,"free; and it became to him as it were wings, and buoyed up the shepherd"
10809,BOOK XIX.,of hosts.
10810,BOOK XIX.,
10811,BOOK XIX.,"And forth from its stand he drew his father’s spear, heavy and great"
10812,BOOK XIX.,"and strong: that spear could none other of the Achaians wield, but"
10813,BOOK XIX.,"Achilles alone awaited to wield it, the Pelian ashen spear that Cheiron"
10814,BOOK XIX.,"gave to his father dear, from a peak of Pelion, to be the death of"
10815,BOOK XIX.,"warriors. And Automedon and Alkimos went about to yoke the horses, and"
10816,BOOK XIX.,"put on them fair breast-straps, and bits within their jaws, and"
10817,BOOK XIX.,stretched the reins behind to the firm-built chariot. Then Automedon
10818,BOOK XIX.,"took the bright lash, fitted to his hand, and sprang up behind the"
10819,BOOK XIX.,"horses, and after him mounted Achilles armed, effulgent in his armour"
10820,BOOK XIX.,like bright Hyperion. And terribly he called upon the horses of his
10821,BOOK XIX.,"sire: “Xanthos and Balios, famed children of Podarge, in other sort"
10822,BOOK XIX.,"take heed to bring your charioteer safe back to the Danaan host, when"
10823,BOOK XIX.,"we have done with battle, and leave him not as ye left Patroklos to lie"
10824,BOOK XIX.,there dead.”
10825,BOOK XIX.,
10826,BOOK XIX.,Then the horse Xanthos of glancing feet made answer unto him from
10827,BOOK XIX.,"beneath the yoke;—and he bowed with his head, and all his mane fell"
10828,BOOK XIX.,from the yoke-cushion beside the yoke and touched the ground;—for the
10829,BOOK XIX.,"white-armed goddess Hera gave him speech: “Yea verily for this hour,"
10830,BOOK XIX.,"dread Achilles, we will still bear thee safe, yet is thy death day nigh"
10831,BOOK XIX.,"at hand, neither shall we be cause thereof, but a mighty god, and"
10832,BOOK XIX.,forceful Fate. For not through sloth or heedlessness of ours did the
10833,BOOK XIX.,"men of Troy from Patrokios’ shoulders strip his arms, but the best of"
10834,BOOK XIX.,"the gods, whom bright-haired Leto bore, slew him in the forefront of"
10835,BOOK XIX.,"the battle, and to Hector gave renown. We even with the wind of Zephyr,"
10836,BOOK XIX.,"swiftest, they say, of all winds, well might run; nathless to thee"
10837,BOOK XIX.,thyself it is appointed to be slain in fight by a god and by a man.”
10838,BOOK XIX.,
10839,BOOK XIX.,Now when he had thus spoken the Erinyes stayed his voice. And sore
10840,BOOK XIX.,"troubled did fleet-footed Achilles answer him: “Xanthos, why"
10841,BOOK XIX.,prophesiest thou my death? no wise behoveth it thee. Well know I of
10842,BOOK XIX.,"myself that it is appointed me to perish here, far from my father dear"
10843,BOOK XIX.,and mother; howbeit anywise I will not refrain till I give the Trojans
10844,BOOK XIX.,surfeit of war.”
10845,BOOK XIX.,
10846,BOOK XIX.,"He said, and with a cry among the foremost held on his whole-hooved"
10847,BOOK XIX.,steeds.
10848,BOOK XIX.,

10853,BOOK XX.,
10854,BOOK XX.,
10855,BOOK XX.,How Achilles made havoc among the men of Troy.
10856,BOOK XX.,
10857,BOOK XX.,
10858,BOOK XX.,"So by the beaked ships around thee, son of Peleus, hungry for war, the"
10859,BOOK XX.,"Achaians armed; and over against them the men of Troy, upon the high"
10860,BOOK XX.,ground of the plain.
10861,BOOK XX.,
10862,BOOK XX.,But Zeus bade Themis call the gods to council from many-folded Olympus’
10863,BOOK XX.,brow; and she ranged all about and bade them to the house of Zeus.
10864,BOOK XX.,"There was no River came not up, save only Ocean, nor any nymph, of all"
10865,BOOK XX.,that haunt fair thickets and springs of rivers and grassy
10866,BOOK XX.,water-meadows. And they came to the house of Zeus who gathereth the
10867,BOOK XX.,"clouds, and sat them down in the polished colonnades which Hephaistos"
10868,BOOK XX.,in the cunning of his heart had wrought for father Zeus.
10869,BOOK XX.,
10870,BOOK XX.,Thus gathered they within the doors of Zeus; nor was the Earthshaker
10871,BOOK XX.,"heedless of the goddess’ call, but from the salt sea came up after the"
10872,BOOK XX.,"rest, and set him in the midst, and inquired concerning the purpose of"
10873,BOOK XX.,"Zeus: “Wherefore, O Lord of the bright lightning, hast thou called the"
10874,BOOK XX.,"gods again to council? Say, ponderest thou somewhat concerning the"
10875,BOOK XX.,"Trojans and Achaians? for lo, the war and the fighting of them are"
10876,BOOK XX.,kindled very nigh.”
10877,BOOK XX.,
10878,BOOK XX.,"And Zeus, who gathered the clouds, answered him, saying: “Thou knowest,"
10879,BOOK XX.,"O Earthshaker, the purpose within my breast, wherefor I gathered you"
10880,BOOK XX.,hither; even in their perishing have I regard unto them. But for me I
10881,BOOK XX.,"will abide here, sitting within a fold of Olympus, where I will gladden"
10882,BOOK XX.,my heart with gazing; but go all ye forth that ye come among the
10883,BOOK XX.,"Trojans and Achaians and succour these or those, howsoever each of you"
10884,BOOK XX.,"hath a mind. For if Achilles alone shall fight against the Trojans, not"
10885,BOOK XX.,"even a little while shall they hold back the son of Peleus, the fleet"
10886,BOOK XX.,"of foot. Nay, but even aforetime they trembled when they looked upon"
10887,BOOK XX.,him; now therefore that his wrath for his friend is waxen terrible I
10888,BOOK XX.,"fear me lest he overleap the bound of fate, and storm the wall.”"
10889,BOOK XX.,
10890,BOOK XX.,"Thus spake the son of Kronos, and roused unabating war. For on this"
10891,BOOK XX.,side and on that the gods went forth to war: to the company of the
10892,BOOK XX.,"ships went Hera, and Pallas Athene, and Poseidon, Earth-enfolder, and"
10893,BOOK XX.,"the Helper Hermes, pro-eminent in subtle thoughts; and with these went"
10894,BOOK XX.,"Hephaistos in the greatness of his strength, halting, but his shrunk"
10895,BOOK XX.,legs moved nimbly under him: but to the Trojans went Ares of the
10896,BOOK XX.,"glancing helm, and with him Phoebus of the unshorn hair, and archer"
10897,BOOK XX.,"Artemis, and Leto and Xanthos and laughter-loving Aphrodite."
10898,BOOK XX.,
10899,BOOK XX.,"Now for so long as gods were afar from mortal men, so long waxed the"
10900,BOOK XX.,"Achaians glorious, for that Achilles was come forth among them, and his"
10901,BOOK XX.,long ceasing from grim battle was at an end. And the Trojans were
10902,BOOK XX.,"smitten with sore trembling in the limbs of every one of them, in"
10903,BOOK XX.,"terror when they beheld the son of Peleus, fleet of foot, blazing in"
10904,BOOK XX.,"his arms, peer of man-slaying Ares. But when among the mellay of men"
10905,BOOK XX.,"the Olympians were come down, then leapt up in her might Strife, rouser"
10906,BOOK XX.,"of hosts, then sent forth Athene a cry, now standing by the hollowed"
10907,BOOK XX.,"trench without the wall, and now on the echoing shores she shouted"
10908,BOOK XX.,"aloud. And a shout uttered Ares against her, terrible as the blackness"
10909,BOOK XX.,"of the storm, now from the height of the city to the Trojans calling"
10910,BOOK XX.,"clear, or again along Simois shore over Kallikolon he sped."
10911,BOOK XX.,
10912,BOOK XX.,"So urged the blessed gods both hosts to battle, then themselves burst"
10913,BOOK XX.,into fierce war. And terribly thundered the father of gods and men from
10914,BOOK XX.,heaven above; and from beneath Poseidon made the vast earth shake and
10915,BOOK XX.,the steep mountain tops. Then trembled all the spurs of many-fountained
10916,BOOK XX.,"Ida, and all her crests, and the city of the Trojans, and the ships of"
10917,BOOK XX.,"the Achaians. And the Lord of the Underworld, Aiedoneus, had terror in"
10918,BOOK XX.,"hell, and leapt from his throne in that terror and cried aloud, lest"
10919,BOOK XX.,"the world be cloven above him by Poseidon, Shaker of earth, and his"
10920,BOOK XX.,"dwelling-place be laid bare to mortals and immortals—grim halls, and"
10921,BOOK XX.,"vast, and lothly to the gods. So loud the roar rose of that battle of"
10922,BOOK XX.,gods. For against King Poseidon stood Phoebus Apollo with his winged
10923,BOOK XX.,"arrows, and against Enyalios stood Athene, bright-eyed goddess, and"
10924,BOOK XX.,"against Hera she of the golden shafts and echoing chase, even archer"
10925,BOOK XX.,"Artemis, sister of the Far-darter; and against Leto the strong Helper"
10926,BOOK XX.,"Hermes, and against Hephaistos the great deep-eddying River, whom gods"
10927,BOOK XX.,call Xanthos and men Skamandros.
10928,BOOK XX.,
10929,BOOK XX.,Thus gods with gods were matched. Meanwhile Achilles yearned above all
10930,BOOK XX.,"to meet Hector, son of Priam, in the fray; for with that blood"
10931,BOOK XX.,"chiefliest his spirit bade him sate Ares, stubborn lord of war. But"
10932,BOOK XX.,"straightway Apollo, rouser of hosts, moved Aineias to go to meet the"
10933,BOOK XX.,"son of Peleus, and filled him with brave spirit: and he made his own"
10934,BOOK XX.,voice like the voice of Lykaon the son of Priam; in his semblance spake
10935,BOOK XX.,"Apollo, son of Zeus: “Aineias, counsellor of Trojans, where now are thy"
10936,BOOK XX.,"threats wherewith thou didst boast to the Trojan lords over thy wine,"
10937,BOOK XX.,"saying thou wouldest stand up in battle against Achilles, Peleus’ son?”"
10938,BOOK XX.,
10939,BOOK XX.,"And to him Aineias answered and said: “Son of Priam, why biddest thou"
10940,BOOK XX.,"me thus face the fierce son of Peleus in battle, though I be not fain"
10941,BOOK XX.,"thereto? Not for the first time now shall I match me with Achilles,"
10942,BOOK XX.,"fleet of foot; once before drave he me with his spear from Ida, when he"
10943,BOOK XX.,harried our kine and wasted Lyrnessos and Pedasos; but Zeus delivered
10944,BOOK XX.,me out of his hand and put strength into my knees that they were swift.
10945,BOOK XX.,"Else had I fallen beneath the hands of Achilles, and of Athene who went"
10946,BOOK XX.,"before and gave him light, and urged him to slay Leleges and Trojans"
10947,BOOK XX.,with his spear of bronze. Therefore it is impossible for man to face
10948,BOOK XX.,"Achilles in fight, for that ever some god is at his side to ward off"
10949,BOOK XX.,"death. Ay, and at any time his spear flieth straight, neither ceaseth"
10950,BOOK XX.,till it have pierced through flesh of man. But if God once give us fair
10951,BOOK XX.,"field of battle, not lightly shall he overcome me, not though he boast"
10952,BOOK XX.,him made of bronze throughout.”
10953,BOOK XX.,
10954,BOOK XX.,"And to him in answer spake Apollo son of Zeus: “Yea, hero, pray thou"
10955,BOOK XX.,"too to the everliving gods; for thou too, men say, wast born of"
10956,BOOK XX.,"Aphrodite daughter of Zeus, and Achilles’ mother is of less degree"
10957,BOOK XX.,"among the gods. For thy mother is child of Zeus, his but of the Ancient"
10958,BOOK XX.,"One of the Sea. Come, bear up thy unwearying spear against him, let him"
10959,BOOK XX.,no wise turn thee back with revilings and bitter words.”
10960,BOOK XX.,
10961,BOOK XX.,"He said, and breathed high spirit into the shepherd of the host, and he"
10962,BOOK XX.,"went onward through the forefront of the fighting, harnessed in"
10963,BOOK XX.,flashing bronze. But white-armed Hera failed not to discern Anchises’
10964,BOOK XX.,"son as he went through the press of men to meet the son of Peleus, and"
10965,BOOK XX.,gathering the gods about her she spake among them thus: “Consider ye
10966,BOOK XX.,"twain, Poseidon and Athene, within your hearts, what shall come of"
10967,BOOK XX.,these things that are done. Here is Aineias gone forth harnessed in
10968,BOOK XX.,"flashing bronze, to meet the son of Peleus, and it is Phoebus Apollo"
10969,BOOK XX.,"that hath sent him. Come then, be it ours to turn him back straightway;"
10970,BOOK XX.,or else let some one of us stand likewise beside Achilles and give him
10971,BOOK XX.,"mighty power, so that he fail not in his spirit, but know that they who"
10972,BOOK XX.,"love him are the best of the Immortals, and that they who from of old"
10973,BOOK XX.,ward war and fighting from the Trojans are vain as wind. All we from
10974,BOOK XX.,Olympus are come down to mingle in this fight that he take no hurt
10975,BOOK XX.,among the Trojans on this day—afterward he shall suffer whatsoever
10976,BOOK XX.,"things Fate span for him with her thread, at his beginning, when his"
10977,BOOK XX.,"mother bare him. If Achilles learn not this from voice divine, then"
10978,BOOK XX.,shall he be afraid when some god shall come against him in the battle;
10979,BOOK XX.,for gods revealed are hard to look upon.”
10980,BOOK XX.,
10981,BOOK XX.,"Then to her made answer Poseidon, Shaker of the earth: “Hera, be not"
10982,BOOK XX.,fierce beyond wisdom; it behoveth thee not. Not fain am I at least to
10983,BOOK XX.,match gods with gods in strife. Let us go now into some high place
10984,BOOK XX.,"apart and seat us there to watch, and battle shall be left to men. Only"
10985,BOOK XX.,"if Ares or Phoebus Apollo fall to fighting, or put constraint upon"
10986,BOOK XX.,"Achilles and hinder him from fight, then straightway among us too shall"
10987,BOOK XX.,"go up the battle-cry of strife; right soon, methinks, shall they hie"
10988,BOOK XX.,them from the issue of the fray back to Olympus to the company of the
10989,BOOK XX.,"gods, overcome by the force of our hands.”"
10990,BOOK XX.,
10991,BOOK XX.,"Thus spake the blue-haired god, and led the way to the mounded wall of"
10992,BOOK XX.,"heaven-sprung Herakles, that lofty wall built him by the Trojans and"
10993,BOOK XX.,"Pallas Athene, that he might escape the monster and be safe from him,"
10994,BOOK XX.,what time he should make his onset from the beach to the plain. There
10995,BOOK XX.,"sate them down Poseidon and the other gods, and clothed their shoulders"
10996,BOOK XX.,with impenetrable cloud. And they of the other part sat down on the
10997,BOOK XX.,"brows of Kallikolon around thee, Archer Phoebus, and Ares waster of"
10998,BOOK XX.,"cities. Thus they on either side sat devising counsels, but shrank all"
10999,BOOK XX.,"from falling to grievous war, and Zeus from his high seat commanded"
11000,BOOK XX.,them.
11001,BOOK XX.,
11002,BOOK XX.,Meanwhile the whole plain was filled with men and horses and ablaze
11003,BOOK XX.,with bronze; and the earth rang with the feet of them as they rushed
11004,BOOK XX.,together in the fray. Two men far better than the rest were meeting in
11005,BOOK XX.,"the midst between the hosts, eager for battle, Aineias, Anchises’ son,"
11006,BOOK XX.,"and noble Achilles. First came on Aineias threateningly, tossing his"
11007,BOOK XX.,"strong helm; his rapid shield he held before his breast, and brandished"
11008,BOOK XX.,his bronze spear. And on the other side the son of Peleus rushed to
11009,BOOK XX.,"meet him like a lion, a ravaging lion whom men desire to slay, a whole"
11010,BOOK XX.,"tribe assembled: and first he goeth his way unheeding, but when some"
11011,BOOK XX.,"warrior youth hath smitten him with a spear, the he gathereth himself"
11012,BOOK XX.,"open-mouthed, and foam cometh forth about his teeth, and his stout"
11013,BOOK XX.,"spirit groaneth in his heart, and with his tail he scourgeth either"
11014,BOOK XX.,"side his ribs and flanks and goadeth himself on to fight, and glaring"
11015,BOOK XX.,"is borne straight on them by his passion, to try whether he shall slay"
11016,BOOK XX.,"some man of them, or whether himself shall perish in the forefront of"
11017,BOOK XX.,the throng: thus was Achilles driven of his passion and valiant spirit
11018,BOOK XX.,to go forth to meet Aineias great of heart. And when they were come
11019,BOOK XX.,"near against each other, then first to Aineias spake fleet-footed noble"
11020,BOOK XX.,"Achilles: “Aineias, wherefore hast thou so far come forward from the"
11021,BOOK XX.,crowd to stand against me: doth thy heart bid thee fight with me in
11022,BOOK XX.,hope of holding Priam’s honour and lordship among the horse-taming
11023,BOOK XX.,"Trojans? Nay, though thou slay me, not for that will Priam lay his"
11024,BOOK XX.,"kingdom in thy hands, for he hath sons, and is sound and of unshaken"
11025,BOOK XX.,mind. Or have the Trojans allotted thee some lot of ground more choice
11026,BOOK XX.,"than all the rest, fair land of tilth and orchard, that thou mayest"
11027,BOOK XX.,"dwell therein, if thou slay me? But methinks thou wilt find the slaying"
11028,BOOK XX.,"hard; for once before, I ween, have I made thee flee before my spear."
11029,BOOK XX.,"Host thou forgotten the day when thou wert alone with the kine, and I"
11030,BOOK XX.,made thee run swift-footed down Ida’s steeps in haste?—then didst thou
11031,BOOK XX.,"not look behind thee in thy flight. Thence fleddest thou to Lernessos,"
11032,BOOK XX.,"but I wasted it, having fought against it with the help of Athene and"
11033,BOOK XX.,"of father Zeus, and carried away women captive, bereaving them of their"
11034,BOOK XX.,"day of freedom: only thee Zeus shielded, and other gods. But not this"
11035,BOOK XX.,"time, methinks, shall they shield thee, as thou imaginest in thy heart:"
11036,BOOK XX.,therefore I bid thee go back into the throng and come not forth against
11037,BOOK XX.,"me, while as yet thou art unhurt—after the event even a fool is wise.”"
11038,BOOK XX.,
11039,BOOK XX.,"Then to him in answer again Aineias spake: “Son of Peleus, think not"
11040,BOOK XX.,"with words to affright me as a child, since I too well know myself how"
11041,BOOK XX.,to speak taunts and unjust speech. We know each other’s race and
11042,BOOK XX.,"lineage in that we have heard the fame proclaimed by mortal men, but"
11043,BOOK XX.,"never hast thou set eyes on my parents, or I on thine. Thou, they say,"
11044,BOOK XX.,"art son of nobie Peleus, and of Thetis of the fair tresses, the"
11045,BOOK XX.,"daughter of the sea: the sire I boast is Anchises great of heart, and"
11046,BOOK XX.,my mother is Aphrodite. Of these shall one pair or the other mourn
11047,BOOK XX.,their dear son today; for verily not with idle words shall we two
11048,BOOK XX.,"satisfy our strife and depart out of the battle. But, if thou wilt,"
11049,BOOK XX.,"learn also this, that thou mayest well know our lineage, known to full"
11050,BOOK XX.,"many men: First Zeus the cloud-gatherer begat Dardanos, and he"
11051,BOOK XX.,"stablished Dardania, for not yet was holy Ilios built upon the plain to"
11052,BOOK XX.,"be a city of mortal men, but still they dwelt on slopes of"
11053,BOOK XX.,"many-fountained Ida. Then Dardanos begat a son, king Erichthonios, who"
11054,BOOK XX.,became richest of mortal men. Three thousand mares had he that pastured
11055,BOOK XX.,"along the marsh meadow, rejoicing in their tender foals. Of them was"
11056,BOOK XX.,"Boreas enamoured as they grazed, and in semblance of a dark-maned horse"
11057,BOOK XX.,he covered them: then they having conceived bare twelve fillies. These
11058,BOOK XX.,when they bounded over Earth the grain-giver would run upon the topmost
11059,BOOK XX.,ripened ears of corn and break them not; and when they bounded over the
11060,BOOK XX.,broad backs of the sea they would run upon the crests of the breakers
11061,BOOK XX.,of the hoary brine. Then Erichthonios begat Tros to be load over the
11062,BOOK XX.,"Trojans, and to Tros three noble sons were born, Ilos and Assarakos and"
11063,BOOK XX.,"godlike Ganymedes, who became the most beautiful of mortal men. Him the"
11064,BOOK XX.,"gods caught up to be cupbearer to Zeus, for sake of his beauty, that he"
11065,BOOK XX.,"might dwell among immortals. Then Ilos again begat a son, noble"
11066,BOOK XX.,"Laomedon, and Laomedon begat Tithonos and Priam and Lamppos and Klytios"
11067,BOOK XX.,"and Hiketaon, of the stock of Ares. And Assarakos begat Kapys, and"
11068,BOOK XX.,"Kapys Anchises, and Anchises me; but Priam begat the goodly Hector."
11069,BOOK XX.,
11070,BOOK XX.,“Lo then of this blood and lineage declare I myself unto thee. But for
11071,BOOK XX.,"valour, Zeus increaseth it in men or minisheth it according as he will,"
11072,BOOK XX.,"for he is lord of all. But come, let us talk thus together no longer"
11073,BOOK XX.,"like children, standing in mid onset of war. For there are revilings in"
11074,BOOK XX.,plenty for both of us to utter—a hundred-thwarted ship would not
11075,BOOK XX.,"suffice for the load of them. Glib is the tongue of man, and many words"
11076,BOOK XX.,"are therein of every kind, and wide is the range of his speech hither"
11077,BOOK XX.,"and thither. Whatsoever word thou speak, such wilt thou hear in answer."
11078,BOOK XX.,But what need that we should bandy strife and wrangling each against
11079,BOOK XX.,"each. Not by speech shalt thou turn me from the battle that I desire,"
11080,BOOK XX.,"until we have fought together, point to point: come then, and"
11081,BOOK XX.,straightway we will each try the other with bronze-headed spears.”
11082,BOOK XX.,
11083,BOOK XX.,"He said, and against that other’s dread and mighty shield hurled his"
11084,BOOK XX.,"great spear, and the shield rang loud beneath the spear-point. And the"
11085,BOOK XX.,"son of Peleus held away the shield from him with his stout hand, in"
11086,BOOK XX.,"fear, for he thought that the far-shadowing spear of Aineias great of"
11087,BOOK XX.,"heart would lightly pierce it through—fond man, and knew not in his"
11088,BOOK XX.,mind and heart that not lightly do the glorious gifts of gods yield to
11089,BOOK XX.,force of mortal men. So did not the great spear of wise Aineias pierce
11090,BOOK XX.,"that shield, for the gold resisted it, even the gift of the god. Yet"
11091,BOOK XX.,"through two folds he drave it, but three remained, for five folds had"
11092,BOOK XX.,"the lame god welded, two bronze, and two inside of tin, and one of"
11093,BOOK XX.,gold; therein was stayed the ashen spear.
11094,BOOK XX.,
11095,BOOK XX.,"Then Achilles in his turn hurled his far-shadowing spear, and smote"
11096,BOOK XX.,"upon the circle of the shield of Aineias, beneath the edge of the rim,"
11097,BOOK XX.,"where the bronze ran thinnest round, and the bull-hide was thinnest"
11098,BOOK XX.,"thereon; and right through sped the Pelian ashen spear, and the shield"
11099,BOOK XX.,cracked under it. And Aineias crouched and held up the shield away from
11100,BOOK XX.,him in dread; and the spear flew over his back and fixed itself in the
11101,BOOK XX.,"earth, having divided asunder the two circles of the sheltering shield."
11102,BOOK XX.,"And having escaped the long spear he stood still, and a vast anguish"
11103,BOOK XX.,"drowned his eyes, affrighted that the spear was planted by him so nigh."
11104,BOOK XX.,"But Achilles drew his sharp sword and furiously made at him, crying his"
11105,BOOK XX.,terrible cry: then Aineias grasped in his hand a stone (a mighty deed)
11106,BOOK XX.,"such as two men, as men now are, would not avail to lift, but he with"
11107,BOOK XX.,ease wielded it all alone. Then would Aineias have smitten him with the
11108,BOOK XX.,"stone as he charged, either on helm or shield, which had warded from"
11109,BOOK XX.,"him bitter death, and then would the son of Peleus have closed and"
11110,BOOK XX.,"slain him with his sword, had not Poseidon, Shaker of earth, marked it"
11111,BOOK XX.,"with speed, and straightway spoken among the immortal gods: “Alas, woe"
11112,BOOK XX.,"is me for Aineias great of heart, who quickly will go down to Hades"
11113,BOOK XX.,"slain by the son of Peleus, for that he will obey the words of Apollo"
11114,BOOK XX.,"the far-darter, fond man, but nowise shall the god help him from"
11115,BOOK XX.,"grievous death. But wherefore now is he to suffer ill in his innocence,"
11116,BOOK XX.,"causelessly for others’ wickedness, yet welcome ever are his offerings"
11117,BOOK XX.,"to the gods who inhabit the spacious heaven? Come, let us guide him out"
11118,BOOK XX.,"of death’s way, lest the son of Kronos be wroth, if Achilles slay him;"
11119,BOOK XX.,"for it is appointed to him to escape, that the race of Dardanos perish"
11120,BOOK XX.,"not without seed or sign, even Dardanos whom the son of Kronos loved"
11121,BOOK XX.,above all the children born to him from the daughters of men. For the
11122,BOOK XX.,race of Priam hath Zeus already hated. But thus shall the might of
11123,BOOK XX.,"Aineias reign among the Trojans, and his children’s children, who shall"
11124,BOOK XX.,be born in the aftertime.”
11125,BOOK XX.,
11126,BOOK XX.,"And him then answered Hera the ox-eyed queen: “Shaker of earth, thyself"
11127,BOOK XX.,"with thine own mind take counsel, whether thou wilt save Aineias, or"
11128,BOOK XX.,"leave him [to be slain, brave though he be, by Achilles, Peleus’ son]."
11129,BOOK XX.,"For by many oaths among all the Immortals have we two sworn, even"
11130,BOOK XX.,"Pallas Athene and I, never to help the Trojans from their evil day, not"
11131,BOOK XX.,"even when all Troy shall burn in the burning of fierce fire, and they"
11132,BOOK XX.,that burn her shall be the warlike sons of the Achaians.”
11133,BOOK XX.,
11134,BOOK XX.,"Now when Poseidon Shaker of earth heard that, he went up amid the"
11135,BOOK XX.,"battle and the clash of spears, and came where Aineias and renowned"
11136,BOOK XX.,"Achilles were. Then presently he shed mist over the eyes of Achilles,"
11137,BOOK XX.,"Peleus’ son, and drew the bronze-headed ashen spear from the shield of"
11138,BOOK XX.,"Aineias great of heart, and set it before Achilles’ feet, and lifted"
11139,BOOK XX.,Aineias and swung him high from off the earth. Over many ranks of
11140,BOOK XX.,"warriors, of horses many, sprang Aineias soaring in the hand of the"
11141,BOOK XX.,"god, and lighted at the farthest verge of the battle of many onsets,"
11142,BOOK XX.,where the Kaukones were arraying them for the fight. Then hard beside
11143,BOOK XX.,"him came Poseidon, Shaker of earth, and spake aloud to him winged"
11144,BOOK XX.,"words: “Aineias, what god is it that biddeth thee fight infatuate"
11145,BOOK XX.,"against Peleus’ vehement son, who is both a better man than thou and"
11146,BOOK XX.,dearer to Immortals? Rather withdraw thee whensoever thou fallest in
11147,BOOK XX.,"with him, lest even contrary to thy fate thou enter the house of Hades."
11148,BOOK XX.,"But when Achilles shall have met his death and doom, then be thou of"
11149,BOOK XX.,"good courage to fight among the foremost, for there shall none other of"
11150,BOOK XX.,the Achaians slay thee.”
11151,BOOK XX.,
11152,BOOK XX.,"He spoke, and left him there, when he had shown him all these things."
11153,BOOK XX.,Then quickly from Achilles’ eyes he purged the magic mist; and he
11154,BOOK XX.,"stared with wide eyes, and in trouble spake unto his proud soul: “Ha!"
11155,BOOK XX.,verily a great marvel behold I here with mine eyes. My spear lieth here
11156,BOOK XX.,"upon the ground, nor can I anywise see the man at whom I hurled it with"
11157,BOOK XX.,intent to slay him. Truly then is Aineias likewise dear to the immortal
11158,BOOK XX.,"gods, howbeit I deemed that his boosting thereof was altogether vanity."
11159,BOOK XX.,"Away with him! not again will he find heart to make trial of me, now"
11160,BOOK XX.,"that once more he has escaped death to his joy. But come, I will call"
11161,BOOK XX.,on the warlike Danaans and go forth to make trial of some other Trojan
11162,BOOK XX.,face to face.”
11163,BOOK XX.,
11164,BOOK XX.,"He said, and leapt along the lines, and called upon each man: “No"
11165,BOOK XX.,"longer stand afar from the men of Troy, noble Achaians, but come let"
11166,BOOK XX.,"man match man and throw his soul into the fight. Hard is it for me,"
11167,BOOK XX.,"though I be strong, to assail so vast a folk and fight them all: not"
11168,BOOK XX.,"even Ares, though an immortal god, nor Athene, could plunge into the"
11169,BOOK XX.,jaws of such a fray and toil therein. But to my utmost power with hands
11170,BOOK XX.,"and feet and strength no whit, I say, will I be slack, nay, never so"
11171,BOOK XX.,"little, but right through their line will I go forward, nor deem I that"
11172,BOOK XX.,any Trojan shall be glad who shall come nigh my spear.”
11173,BOOK XX.,
11174,BOOK XX.,Thus spake he urging them. But to the Trojans glorious Hector called
11175,BOOK XX.,"aloud, and proclaimed that he would go forth against Achilles:"
11176,BOOK XX.,"“High-hearted Trojans, fear not Peleus’ son. I too in words could fight"
11177,BOOK XX.,"even Immortals, but with the spear it were hard, for they are stronger"
11178,BOOK XX.,"far. Neither shall Achilles accomplish all his talk, but part thereof"
11179,BOOK XX.,"he is to accomplish, and part to break asunder in the midst. And"
11180,BOOK XX.,"against him will I go forth, though the hands of him be even as fire,"
11181,BOOK XX.,yea though his hands be as fire and his fierceness as the flaming
11182,BOOK XX.,steel.”
11183,BOOK XX.,
11184,BOOK XX.,"Thus spake he urging them, and the Trojans raised their spears for"
11185,BOOK XX.,"battle; and their fierceness was mingled confusedly, and the battle-cry"
11186,BOOK XX.,"arose. Then Phoebus Apollo stood by Hector and spake to him: “Hector,"
11187,BOOK XX.,"no longer challenge Achilles at all before the lines, but in the throng"
11188,BOOK XX.,"await him and from amid the roar of the battle, lest haply he spear"
11189,BOOK XX.,thee or come near and smite thee with his sword.”
11190,BOOK XX.,
11191,BOOK XX.,"Thus spake he, and Hector again fell back into the crowd of men, for he"
11192,BOOK XX.,was amazed when he heard the sound of a god’s voice.
11193,BOOK XX.,
11194,BOOK XX.,"But Achilles sprang in among the Trojans, his heart clothed with"
11195,BOOK XX.,"strength, crying his terrible cry, and first he took Iphition,"
11196,BOOK XX.,"Otrynteus’ valiant son, a leader of much people, born of a Naiad nymph"
11197,BOOK XX.,"to Otrynteus waster of cities, beneath snowy Tmolos, in Hyde’s rich"
11198,BOOK XX.,domain. Him as he came right on did goodly Achilles smite with his
11199,BOOK XX.,"hurled spear, down through the midst of his head, and it was rent"
11200,BOOK XX.,"asunder utterly. And he fell with a crash, and goodly Achilles exulted"
11201,BOOK XX.,"over him; “here is thy death, thy birth was on the Gygaian lake, where"
11202,BOOK XX.,"is thy sire’s demesne, by Hyllos rich in fish and eddying Hermos.”"
11203,BOOK XX.,
11204,BOOK XX.,"Thus spake he exultant, but darkness fell upon the eyes of Iphition:"
11205,BOOK XX.,him the chariots of the Achaians clave with their tires asunder in the
11206,BOOK XX.,"forefront of the battle, and over him Achilles pierced in the temples,"
11207,BOOK XX.,"through his bronze-cheeked helmet, Demoleon, brave stemmer of battle,"
11208,BOOK XX.,"Antenor’s son. No stop made the bronze helmet, but therethrough sped"
11209,BOOK XX.,"the spear-head and clave the bone, and the brain within was all"
11210,BOOK XX.,"scattered: that stroke made ending of his zeal. Then Hippodamas, as he"
11211,BOOK XX.,"leapt from his chariot and fled before him, Achilles wounded in the"
11212,BOOK XX.,"back with his spear: and he breathed forth his spirit with a roar, as"
11213,BOOK XX.,when a dragged bull roareth that the young men drag to the altar of the
11214,BOOK XX.,Lord of Helike; for in such hath the Earthshaker his delight: thus
11215,BOOK XX.,roared Hippodamas as from his bones fled forth his haughty spirit. But
11216,BOOK XX.,"Achilles with his spear went on after godlike Polydoros, Priam’s son."
11217,BOOK XX.,"Him would his sire continually forbid to fight, for that among his"
11218,BOOK XX.,"children he was youngest born and best beloved, and overcame all in"
11219,BOOK XX.,"fleetness of foot. Just then in boyish folly, displaying the swiftness"
11220,BOOK XX.,"of his feet, he was rushing through the forefighters, until he lost his"
11221,BOOK XX.,life. Him in the midst did fleet-footed noble Achilles smite with a
11222,BOOK XX.,"javelin, in his back as he darted by, where his belt’s golden buckles"
11223,BOOK XX.,"clasped, and the breast and back plates overlapped: and right through"
11224,BOOK XX.,"beside the navel went the spear-head, and he fell on his knee with a"
11225,BOOK XX.,"cry, and dark cloud covered him round about, and he clasped his bowels"
11226,BOOK XX.,to him with his hands as he sank.
11227,BOOK XX.,
11228,BOOK XX.,Then when Hector saw his brother Polydoros clasping his bowels with his
11229,BOOK XX.,"hands, and sinking to the earth, a mist fell over his eyes, nor longer"
11230,BOOK XX.,"might he endure to range so far apart, but he came up against Achilles"
11231,BOOK XX.,"brandishing his sharp spear, and like flame of fire. And Achilles when"
11232,BOOK XX.,"he saw him, sprang up, and spake exultingly: “Behold the man who hath"
11233,BOOK XX.,"deepest stricken into my soul, who slew my dear-prized friend; not long"
11234,BOOK XX.,shall we now shrink from each other along the highways of the war.”
11235,BOOK XX.,
11236,BOOK XX.,"He said, and looking grimly spake unto goodly Hector: “Come thou near,"
11237,BOOK XX.,that the sooner thou mayest arrive at the goal of death.”
11238,BOOK XX.,
11239,BOOK XX.,"Then to him, unterrified, said Hector of the glancing helm: “Son of"
11240,BOOK XX.,"Peleus, think not with words to affright me as a child, since I too"
11241,BOOK XX.,know myself how to speak taunts and unjust speech. And I know that thou
11242,BOOK XX.,"art a man of might, and a far better man than I. Yet doth this issue"
11243,BOOK XX.,"lie in the lap of the gods, whether I though weaker shall take thy life"
11244,BOOK XX.,"with my hurled spear, for mine too hath been found keen ere now.”"
11245,BOOK XX.,
11246,BOOK XX.,"He said, and poised his spear and hurled it, and Athene with a breath"
11247,BOOK XX.,"turned it back from glorious Achilles, breathing very lightly; and it"
11248,BOOK XX.,"came back to goodly Hector, and fell there before his feet. Then"
11249,BOOK XX.,"Achilles set fiercely upon him, eager to slay him, crying his terrible"
11250,BOOK XX.,"cry. But Apollo caught Hector up, very easily, as a god may, and hid"
11251,BOOK XX.,him in thick mist. Thrice then did fleet-footed noble Achilles make
11252,BOOK XX.,"onset with his spear of bronze, and thrice smote the thick mist. [But"
11253,BOOK XX.,"when the fourth time he had come godlike on,] then with dread shout he"
11254,BOOK XX.,"spake to him winged words: “Dog, thou art now again escaped from death;"
11255,BOOK XX.,"yet came ill very nigh thee; but now hath Phoebus Apollo saved thee, to"
11256,BOOK XX.,whom thou must surely pray when thou goest forth amid the clash of
11257,BOOK XX.,"spears. Verily I will slay thee yet when I meet thee hereafter, if any"
11258,BOOK XX.,"god is helper of me too. Now will I make after the rest, whomsoever I"
11259,BOOK XX.,may seize.”
11260,BOOK XX.,
11261,BOOK XX.,Thus speaking he pierced Dryops in the midst of his neck with his
11262,BOOK XX.,"spear, and he fell down before his feet. But he left him where he lay,"
11263,BOOK XX.,"and hurled at Demuchos Philetor’s son, a good man and a tall, and"
11264,BOOK XX.,stayed him with a stroke upon his knees; then smote him with his mighty
11265,BOOK XX.,"sword and reft him of life. Then springing on Laogonos and Dardanos,"
11266,BOOK XX.,"sons of Bias, he thrust both from their chariot to the ground, one with"
11267,BOOK XX.,a spear-cast smiting and the other in close battle with his sword. Then
11268,BOOK XX.,"Tros, Alastor’s son—he came and clasped his knees to pray him to spare"
11269,BOOK XX.,"him, and let him live, and slay him not, having compassion on his like"
11270,BOOK XX.,"age, fond fool, and knew not that he might not gain his prayers; for"
11271,BOOK XX.,"nowise soft of heart or tender was that man, but of fierce mood—with"
11272,BOOK XX.,"his hands he touched Achilles’ knees, eager to entreat him, but he"
11273,BOOK XX.,"smote him in the liver with his sword, and his liver fell from him, and"
11274,BOOK XX.,"black blood therefrom filled his bosom, and he swooned, and darkness"
11275,BOOK XX.,"covered his eyes. Then Achilles came near and struck Mulios in the ear,"
11276,BOOK XX.,and right through the other ear went the bronze spear-head. Then he
11277,BOOK XX.,smote Agenor’s son Echeklos on the midst of the head with his hilted
11278,BOOK XX.,"sword, and all the sword grew hot thereat with blood; and dark death"
11279,BOOK XX.,"seized his eyes, and forceful fate. Then next Deukalion, just where the"
11280,BOOK XX.,"sinews of the elbow join, there pierced he him through the forearm with"
11281,BOOK XX.,"his bronze spear-head; so abode he with his arm weighed down, beholding"
11282,BOOK XX.,death before him; and Achilles smiting the neck with his sword swept
11283,BOOK XX.,"far both head and helm, and the marrow rose out of the backbone, and"
11284,BOOK XX.,the corpse lay stretched upon the earth. Then went he onward after
11285,BOOK XX.,"Peires’ noble son, Rhigmos, who had come from deep-soiled Thrace: him"
11286,BOOK XX.,"in the midst he smote with his hurled javelin, and the point fixed in"
11287,BOOK XX.,"his lung, and he fell forth of his chariot. And Areithoos his squire,"
11288,BOOK XX.,"as he turned the horses round, he pierced in the back with his sharp"
11289,BOOK XX.,"spear, and thrust him from the car, and the horse ran wild with fear."
11290,BOOK XX.,
11291,BOOK XX.,"As through deep glens rageth fierce fire on some parched mountain-side,"
11292,BOOK XX.,"and the deep forest burneth, and the wind driving it whirleth every way"
11293,BOOK XX.,"the flame, so raged he every way with his spear, as it had been a god,"
11294,BOOK XX.,pressing hard on the men he slew; and the black earth ran with blood.
11295,BOOK XX.,For even as when one yoketh wide-browed bulls to tread white barley in
11296,BOOK XX.,"a stablished threshing-floor, and quickly is it trodden out beneath the"
11297,BOOK XX.,"feet of the loud-lowing bulls, thus beneath great-hearted Achilles his"
11298,BOOK XX.,whole-hooved horses trampled corpses and shields together; and with
11299,BOOK XX.,blood all the axletree below was sprinkled and the rims that ran around
11300,BOOK XX.,"the car, for blood-drops from the horses’ hooves splashed them, and"
11301,BOOK XX.,blood-drops from the tires of the wheels. But the son of Peleus pressed
11302,BOOK XX.,"on to win him glory, flecking with gore his irresistible hands."
11303,BOOK XX.,

11306,BOOK XX.,
11307,BOOK XXI.,BOOK XXI.
11308,BOOK XXI.,
11309,BOOK XXI.,
11310,BOOK XXI.,"How Achilles fought with the River, and chased the men of Troy within"
11311,BOOK XXI.,their gates.
11312,BOOK XXI.,
11313,BOOK XXI.,
11314,BOOK XXI.,"But when now they came unto the ford of the fair-flowing river, even"
11315,BOOK XXI.,"eddying Xanthos, whom immortal Zeus begat, there sundering them he"
11316,BOOK XXI.,"chased the one part to the plain toward the city, even where the"
11317,BOOK XXI.,"Achaians were flying in affright the day before, when glorious Hector"
11318,BOOK XXI.,"was in his fury—thither poured some in flight, and Hera spread before"
11319,BOOK XXI.,them thick mist to hinder them:—but half were pent into the
11320,BOOK XXI.,"deep-flowing silver eddied river, and fell therein with a mighty noise,"
11321,BOOK XXI.,"and the steep channel sounded, and the banks around rang loudly; for"
11322,BOOK XXI.,with shouting they swam therein hither and thither whirled round the
11323,BOOK XXI.,eddies. And as when at the rush of fire locusts take wing to fly unto a
11324,BOOK XXI.,"river, and the unwearying fire flameth forth on them with sudden onset,"
11325,BOOK XXI.,and they huddle in the water; so before Achilles was the stream of
11326,BOOK XXI.,deep-eddying Xanthos filled with the roar and the throng of horses and
11327,BOOK XXI.,men.
11328,BOOK XXI.,
11329,BOOK XXI.,"Then the seed of Zeus left behind him his spear upon the bank, leant"
11330,BOOK XXI.,"against tamarisk bushes, and leapt in, as it were a god, keeping his"
11331,BOOK XXI.,"sword alone, and devised grim work at heart, and smote as he turned him"
11332,BOOK XXI.,every way about: and their groaning went up ghastly as they were
11333,BOOK XXI.,"stricken by the sword, and the water reddened with blood. As before a"
11334,BOOK XXI.,dolphin of huge maw fly other fish and fill the nooks of some
11335,BOOK XXI.,"fair-havened bay, in terror, for he devoureth amain whichsoever of them"
11336,BOOK XXI.,he may catch; so along the channels of that dread stream the Trojans
11337,BOOK XXI.,crouched beneath the precipitous sides. And when his hands were weary
11338,BOOK XXI.,"of slaughter he chose twelve young men alive out of the river, an"
11339,BOOK XXI.,"atonement for Patroklos, Menoitios’ son that was dead. These brought he"
11340,BOOK XXI.,"forth amazed like fawns, and bound behind them their hands with"
11341,BOOK XXI.,"well-cut thongs, which they themselves wore on their pliant doublets,"
11342,BOOK XXI.,and gave them to his comrades to lead down to the hollow ships. Then
11343,BOOK XXI.,"again he made his onset, athirst for slaying."
11344,BOOK XXI.,
11345,BOOK XXI.,"There met he a son of Dardanid Priam, in flight out of the river,"
11346,BOOK XXI.,"Lykaon, whom once himself he took and brought unwilling out of his"
11347,BOOK XXI.,"father’s orchard, in a night assault; he was cutting with keen bronze"
11348,BOOK XXI.,"young shoots of a wild fig tree, to be hand-rails of a chariot; but to"
11349,BOOK XXI.,him an unlooked-for bane came goodly Achilles. And at that time he sold
11350,BOOK XXI.,"him into well-peopled Lemnos, sending him on ship board, and the son of"
11351,BOOK XXI.,Jason gave a price for him; and thence a guest friend freed him with a
11352,BOOK XXI.,"great ransom, Eetion of Imbros, and sent him to goodly Arisbe; whence"
11353,BOOK XXI.,flying secretly he came to his father’s house. Eleven days he rejoiced
11354,BOOK XXI.,"among his friends after he was come from Lemnos, but on the twelfth"
11355,BOOK XXI.,"once more God brought him into the hands of Achilles, who was to send"
11356,BOOK XXI.,him to the house of Hades though nowise fain to go. Him when
11357,BOOK XXI.,"fleet-footed noble Achilles saw bare of helm and shield, neither had he"
11358,BOOK XXI.,"a spear, but had thrown all to the ground; for he sweated grievously as"
11359,BOOK XXI.,"he tried to flee out of the river, and his knees were failing him for"
11360,BOOK XXI.,weariness: then in wrath spake Achilles to his great heart: “Ha! verily
11361,BOOK XXI.,great marvel is this that I behold with my eyes. Surely then will the
11362,BOOK XXI.,proud Trojans whom I have slain rise up again from beneath the murky
11363,BOOK XXI.,"gloom, since thus hath this man come back escaped from his pitiless"
11364,BOOK XXI.,"fate, though sold into goodly Lemnos, neither hath the deep of the"
11365,BOOK XXI.,"hoary sea stayed him, that holdeth many against their will. But come"
11366,BOOK XXI.,"then, of our spear’s point shall he taste, that I may see and learn in"
11367,BOOK XXI.,"my mind whether likewise he shall come back even from beneath, or"
11368,BOOK XXI.,"whether the life-giving Earth shall hold him down, she that holdeth so"
11369,BOOK XXI.,even the strong.”
11370,BOOK XXI.,
11371,BOOK XXI.,"Thus pondered he in his place; but the other came near amazed, fain to"
11372,BOOK XXI.,"touch his knees, for his soul longed exceedingly to flee from evil"
11373,BOOK XXI.,death and black destruction. Then goodly Achilles lifted his long spear
11374,BOOK XXI.,"with intent to smite him, but he stooped and ran under it and caught"
11375,BOOK XXI.,"his knees; and the spear went over his back and stood in the ground,"
11376,BOOK XXI.,"hungering for flesh of men. Then Lykaon besought him, with one hand"
11377,BOOK XXI.,"holding his knees, while with the other he held the sharp spear and"
11378,BOOK XXI.,"loosed it not, and spake to him winged words: “I cry thee mercy,"
11379,BOOK XXI.,"Achilles; have thou regard and pity for me: to thee, O fosterling of"
11380,BOOK XXI.,"Zeus, am I in the bonds of suppliantship. For at thy table first I"
11381,BOOK XXI.,tasted meal of Demeter on the day when thou didst take me captive in
11382,BOOK XXI.,"the well-ordered orchard, and didst sell me away from my father and my"
11383,BOOK XXI.,"friends unto goodly Lemnos, and I fetched thee the price of a hundred"
11384,BOOK XXI.,"oxen. And now have I been ransomed for thrice that, and this is my"
11385,BOOK XXI.,twelfth morn since I came to Ilios after much pain. Now once again hath
11386,BOOK XXI.,ruinous fate delivered me unto thy hands; surely I must be hated of
11387,BOOK XXI.,"father Zeus, that he hath given me a second time unto thee; and to"
11388,BOOK XXI.,"short life my mother bare me, Laothoe, old Altes’ daughter—Altes who"
11389,BOOK XXI.,"ruleth among the war-loving Leleges, holding steep Pedasos on the"
11390,BOOK XXI.,"Satnioeis. His daughter Priam had to wife, with many others, and of her"
11391,BOOK XXI.,"were we two born, and thou wilt butcher both. Him among the foremost of"
11392,BOOK XXI.,"the foot-soldiers didst thou lay low, even godlike Polydoros, when thou"
11393,BOOK XXI.,smotest him with they sharp spear: and now will it go hard with me
11394,BOOK XXI.,"here, for no hope have I to escape thy hands, since God hath delivered"
11395,BOOK XXI.,"me thereunto. Yet one thing will I tell thee, and do thou lay it to"
11396,BOOK XXI.,"heart: slay me not, since I am not of the same mother as Hector, who"
11397,BOOK XXI.,slew thy comrade the gentle and brave.”
11398,BOOK XXI.,
11399,BOOK XXI.,"Thus spake to him the noble son of Priam, beseeching him with words,"
11400,BOOK XXI.,"but he heard a voice implacable: “Fond fool, proffer me no ransom, nor"
11401,BOOK XXI.,"these words. Until Patroklos met his fated day, then was it welcomer to"
11402,BOOK XXI.,"my soul to spare the men of Troy, and many I took alive and sold beyond"
11403,BOOK XXI.,"the sea: but now there is none shall escape death, whomsoever before"
11404,BOOK XXI.,"Ilios God shall deliver into my hands—yes, even among all Trojans, but"
11405,BOOK XXI.,"chiefest among Priam’s sons. Ay, friend, thou too must die: why"
11406,BOOK XXI.,"lamentest thou? Patroklos is dead, who was better far than thou. Seest"
11407,BOOK XXI.,thou not also what manner of man am I for might and goodliness? and a
11408,BOOK XXI.,"good man was my father, and a goddess mother bare me. Yet over me too"
11409,BOOK XXI.,hang death and forceful fate. There cometh morn or eve or some noonday
11410,BOOK XXI.,"when my life too some man shall take in battle, whether with spear he"
11411,BOOK XXI.,smite or arrow from the string.”
11412,BOOK XXI.,
11413,BOOK XXI.,"Thus spake he, and the other’s knees and heart were unstrung. He let go"
11414,BOOK XXI.,"Achilles’ spear, and sat with both hands outspread. But Achilles drew"
11415,BOOK XXI.,"his sharp sword and smote on the collar-bone beside the neck, and all"
11416,BOOK XXI.,"the two-edged sword sank into him, and he lay stretched prone upon the"
11417,BOOK XXI.,"earth, and blood flowed dark from him and soaked the earth. Him seized"
11418,BOOK XXI.,"Achilles by the foot and sent him down the stream, and over him"
11419,BOOK XXI.,"exulting spake winged words: “There lie thou among the fishes, which"
11420,BOOK XXI.,"shall lick off thy wound’s blood heedlessly, nor shall thy mother lay"
11421,BOOK XXI.,"thee on a bed and mourn for thee, but Skamandros shall bear thee on his"
11422,BOOK XXI.,eddies into the broad bosom of the sea. Leaping along the wave shall
11423,BOOK XXI.,many a fish dart up to the dark ripple to eat of the white flesh of
11424,BOOK XXI.,"Lykaon. So perish all, until we reach the citadel of sacred Ilios, ye"
11425,BOOK XXI.,"flying and I behind destroying. Nor even the River, fair-flowing,"
11426,BOOK XXI.,"silver-eddied, shall avail you, to whom long time forsooth ye sacrifice"
11427,BOOK XXI.,"many bulls, and among his eddies throw whole-hooved horses down alive."
11428,BOOK XXI.,"For all this yet shall ye die the death, until ye pay all for"
11429,BOOK XXI.,Patroklos’ slaying and the slaughter of Achaians whom at the swift
11430,BOOK XXI.,ships ye slew while I tarried afar.”
11431,BOOK XXI.,
11432,BOOK XXI.,"Thus spake he, but the River waxed ever more wroth in his heart, and"
11433,BOOK XXI.,"sought in his soul how he should stay goodly Achilles from his work,"
11434,BOOK XXI.,and ward destruction from the Trojans. Meanwhile the son of Peleus with
11435,BOOK XXI.,"his far-shadowing spear leapt, fain to slay him, upon Asteropaios son"
11436,BOOK XXI.,"of Pelegon, whom wide-flowing Axios begat of Periboia eldest of the"
11437,BOOK XXI.,"daughters of Akessamenos. Upon him set Achilles, and Asteropaios stood"
11438,BOOK XXI.,"against him from the river, holding two spears; for Xanthos put courage"
11439,BOOK XXI.,"into his heart, being angered for the slaughtered youths whom Achilles"
11440,BOOK XXI.,was slaughtering along the stream and had no pity on them. Then when
11441,BOOK XXI.,"the twain were come nigh in onset on each other, unto him first spake"
11442,BOOK XXI.,"fleet-footed noble Achilles: “Who and whence art thou of men, that"
11443,BOOK XXI.,darest to come against me? Ill-fated are they whose children match them
11444,BOOK XXI.,with my might.”
11445,BOOK XXI.,
11446,BOOK XXI.,"And to him, made answer Pelegon’s noble son: “High-hearted son of"
11447,BOOK XXI.,"Peleus, why askest thou my lineage? I come from deep-soiled Paionia, a"
11448,BOOK XXI.,"land far off, leading Paionian men with their long spears, and this now"
11449,BOOK XXI.,is the eleventh morn since I am come to Ilios. My lineage is of
11450,BOOK XXI.,"wide-flowing Axios, who begat Pelegon famous with the spear, and he,"
11451,BOOK XXI.,"men say, was my father. Now fight we, noble Achilles!”"
11452,BOOK XXI.,
11453,BOOK XXI.,"Thus spake he in defiance, and goodly Achilles lifted the Pelian ash:"
11454,BOOK XXI.,"but the warrior Asteropaios hurled with both spears together, for he"
11455,BOOK XXI.,"could use both hands alike, and with the one spear smote the shield,"
11456,BOOK XXI.,"but pierced it not right through, for the gold stayed it, the gift of a"
11457,BOOK XXI.,"god; and with the other he grazed the elbow of Achilles’ right arm, and"
11458,BOOK XXI.,"there leapt forth dark blood, but the point beyond him fixed itself in"
11459,BOOK XXI.,"the earth, eager to batten on flesh. Then in his turn Achilles hurled"
11460,BOOK XXI.,"on Asteropaios his straight-flying ash, fain to have slain him, but"
11461,BOOK XXI.,"missed the man and struck the high bank, and quivering half its length"
11462,BOOK XXI.,in the bank he left the ashen spear. Then the son of Peleus drew his
11463,BOOK XXI.,"sharp sword from his thigh and leapt fiercely at him, and he availed"
11464,BOOK XXI.,not to draw with his stout hand Achilles’ ashen shaft from the steep
11465,BOOK XXI.,"bank. Thrice shook he it striving to draw it forth, and thrice gave up"
11466,BOOK XXI.,"the strain, but the fourth time he was fain to bend and break the ashen"
11467,BOOK XXI.,"spear of the seed of Aiakos, but ere that Achilles closing on him reft"
11468,BOOK XXI.,him of life with his sword. For in the belly he smote him beside the
11469,BOOK XXI.,"navel, and all his bowels gushed out to the earth, and darkness covered"
11470,BOOK XXI.,his eyes as he lay gasping. Then Achilles trampling on his breast
11471,BOOK XXI.,stripped off his armour and spake exultingly: “Lie there! It is hard to
11472,BOOK XXI.,"strive against children of Kronos’ mighty son, even though one be"
11473,BOOK XXI.,sprung from a River-god. Thou truly declarest thyself the seed of a
11474,BOOK XXI.,"wide-flowing River, but I avow me of the linkage of great Zeus. My sire"
11475,BOOK XXI.,"is a man ruling many Myrmidons, Peleus the son of Aiakos, and Aiakos"
11476,BOOK XXI.,was begotten of Zeus. As Zeus is mightier than seaward-murmuring
11477,BOOK XXI.,"rivers, so is the seed of Zeus made mightier than the seed of a river."
11478,BOOK XXI.,"Nay, there is hard beside thee a great river, if he may anywise avail;"
11479,BOOK XXI.,but against Zeus the son of Kronos it is not possible to fight. For him
11480,BOOK XXI.,"not even king Acheloios is match, nor yet the great strength of"
11481,BOOK XXI.,"deep-flowing Ocean, from whom all rivers flow and every sea, and all"
11482,BOOK XXI.,"springs and deep wells: yea, even he hath fear of the lightning of"
11483,BOOK XXI.,"great Zeus and his dread thunder, when it pealeth out of heaven.”"
11484,BOOK XXI.,
11485,BOOK XXI.,"He said, and from the steep bank drew his bronze spear, and left there"
11486,BOOK XXI.,"Asteropaios whom he had slain, lying in the sands, and the dark water"
11487,BOOK XXI.,"flooded him. Around him eels and fishes swarmed, tearing and gnawing"
11488,BOOK XXI.,the fat about his kidneys. But Achilles went on after the charioted
11489,BOOK XXI.,"Paiones who still along the eddying river huddled in fear, when they"
11490,BOOK XXI.,saw their best man in the stress of battle slain violently by the hands
11491,BOOK XXI.,and the sword of the son of Peleus. There slew he Thersilochos and
11492,BOOK XXI.,Mydon and Astypylos and Mnesos and Thrasios and Ainios and Ophelestes;
11493,BOOK XXI.,"and more yet of the Paiones would swift Achilles have slain, had not"
11494,BOOK XXI.,"the deep-eddying River called unto him in wrath, in semblance of a man,"
11495,BOOK XXI.,"and from an eddy’s depth sent forth a voice: “O Achilles, thy might and"
11496,BOOK XXI.,thy evil work are beyond the measure of men; for gods themselves are
11497,BOOK XXI.,ever helping thee. If indeed the son of Kronos hath delivered thee all
11498,BOOK XXI.,"the Trojans to destroy, at least drive them forth from me and do thy"
11499,BOOK XXI.,"grim deeds on the plain, for filled with dead men is my pleasant bed,"
11500,BOOK XXI.,"nor can I pour my stream to the great sea, being choked with dead, and"
11501,BOOK XXI.,"thou slayest ruthlessly. Come then, let be; I am astonished, O captain"
11502,BOOK XXI.,of hosts.”
11503,BOOK XXI.,
11504,BOOK XXI.,"And to him answered Achilles fleet of foot: “So be it, heaven-sprung"
11505,BOOK XXI.,"Skamandros, even as thou biddest. But the proud Trojans I will not"
11506,BOOK XXI.,"cease from slaying until I have driven them into their city, and have"
11507,BOOK XXI.,made trial with Hector face to face whether he is to vanquish me or I
11508,BOOK XXI.,him.”
11509,BOOK XXI.,
11510,BOOK XXI.,"Thus saying, he set upon the Trojans, like a god. Then unto Apollo"
11511,BOOK XXI.,"spake the deep-eddying River: “Out on it, lord of the silver bow, child"
11512,BOOK XXI.,"of Zeus, thou hast not kept the ordinance of Kronos’ son, who charged"
11513,BOOK XXI.,"thee straitly to stand by the Trojans and to help them, until eve come"
11514,BOOK XXI.,"with light late-setting, and darken the deep-soiled earth.”"
11515,BOOK XXI.,
11516,BOOK XXI.,"He said, and spear-famed Achilles sprang from the bank and leapt into"
11517,BOOK XXI.,"his midst; but he rushed on him in a furious wave, and stirred up all"
11518,BOOK XXI.,"his streams in tumult, and swept down the many dead who lay thick in"
11519,BOOK XXI.,"him, slain by Achilles; these out to land he cast with bellowing like a"
11520,BOOK XXI.,"bull, and saved the living under his fair streams, hiding them within"
11521,BOOK XXI.,eddies deep and wide. But terribly around Achilles arose his tumultuous
11522,BOOK XXI.,"wave, and the stream smote violently against his shield, nor availed he"
11523,BOOK XXI.,"to stand firm upon his feet. Then he grasped a tall fair-grown elm, and"
11524,BOOK XXI.,"it fell uprooted and tore away all the bank, and reached over the fair"
11525,BOOK XXI.,"river bed with its thick shoots, and stemmed the River himself, falling"
11526,BOOK XXI.,"all within him: and Achilles, struggling out of the eddy, made haste to"
11527,BOOK XXI.,"fly over the plain with his swift feet, for he was afraid. But the"
11528,BOOK XXI.,"great god ceased not, but arose upon him with darkness on his crest,"
11529,BOOK XXI.,"that he might stay noble Achilles from slaughter, and ward destruction"
11530,BOOK XXI.,from the men of Troy. And the son of Peleus rushed away a spear’s
11531,BOOK XXI.,"throw, with the swoop of a black eagle, the mighty hunter, strongest at"
11532,BOOK XXI.,"once and swiftest of winged birds. Like him he sped, and on his breast"
11533,BOOK XXI.,"the bronze rang terribly as he fled from beneath the onset, and behind"
11534,BOOK XXI.,him the River rushed on with a mighty roar. As when a field-waterer
11535,BOOK XXI.,from a dark spring leadeth water along a bed through crops and garden
11536,BOOK XXI.,"grounds, a mattock in his hands, casting forth hindrances from the"
11537,BOOK XXI.,"ditch, and as it floweth all pebbles are swept down, and swiftly"
11538,BOOK XXI.,"gliding it murmureth down a sloping place, and outrunneth him that is"
11539,BOOK XXI.,its guide:—thus ever the river wave caught up Achilles for all his
11540,BOOK XXI.,speed; for gods are mightier than men. For whensoever fleet-footed
11541,BOOK XXI.,"noble Achilles struggled to stand against it, and know whether all"
11542,BOOK XXI.,"immortals be upon him who inhabit spacious heaven, then would a great"
11543,BOOK XXI.,"wave of the heaven-sprung River beat upon his shoulders from above, and"
11544,BOOK XXI.,"he sprang upward with his feet, sore vexed at heart; and the River was"
11545,BOOK XXI.,"wearying his knees with violent rush beneath, devouring the earth from"
11546,BOOK XXI.,"under his feet. Then the son of Peleus cried aloud, looking up to the"
11547,BOOK XXI.,"broad heaven: “Zeus, Father, how doth none of the gods take it on him"
11548,BOOK XXI.,in pity to save me from the River! after that let come to me what may.
11549,BOOK XXI.,"None other of the inhabitants of Heaven is chargeable so much, but only"
11550,BOOK XXI.,"my dear mother, who beguiled me with false words, saying that under the"
11551,BOOK XXI.,wall of the mail-clad men of Troy I must die by the swift arrows of
11552,BOOK XXI.,"Apollo. Would that Hector had slain me, the best of men bred here: then"
11553,BOOK XXI.,"brave had been the slayer, and a brave man had he slain. But now by a"
11554,BOOK XXI.,"sorry death am I doomed to die, pent in this mighty river, like a"
11555,BOOK XXI.,swineherd boy whom a torrent sweepeth down as he essayeth to cross it
11556,BOOK XXI.,in a storm.”
11557,BOOK XXI.,
11558,BOOK XXI.,"Thus spake he, and quickly Poseidon and Athene came near and stood"
11559,BOOK XXI.,"beside him, in the likeness of men, and taking his hands in theirs"
11560,BOOK XXI.,"pledged him in words. And the first that spake was Poseidon, Shaker of"
11561,BOOK XXI.,"the earth: “Son of Peleus, tremble not, neither be afraid; such helpers"
11562,BOOK XXI.,"of thee are we from the gods, approved of Zeus, even Pallas Athene and"
11563,BOOK XXI.,"I, for to be vanquished of a river is not appointed thee, but he will"
11564,BOOK XXI.,"soon give back, and thou wilt thyself perceive it: but we will give"
11565,BOOK XXI.,"thee wise counsel, if thou wilt obey it; hold not thy hand from"
11566,BOOK XXI.,hazardous battle until within Ilios’ famous walls thou have pent the
11567,BOOK XXI.,"Trojan host, even all that flee before thee. But do thou, when thou"
11568,BOOK XXI.,"hast taken the life of Hector, go back unto the ships; this glory we"
11569,BOOK XXI.,give unto thee to win.”
11570,BOOK XXI.,
11571,BOOK XXI.,"They having thus spoken departed to the immortals, but he toward the"
11572,BOOK XXI.,plain—for the bidding of gods was strong upon him—went onward; and all
11573,BOOK XXI.,"the plain was filled with water-flood, and many beautiful arms and"
11574,BOOK XXI.,corpses of slain youths were drifting there. So upward sprang his knees
11575,BOOK XXI.,"as he rushed against the stream right on, nor stayed him the"
11576,BOOK XXI.,"wide-flowing River, for Athene put great strength in him. Neither did"
11577,BOOK XXI.,"Skamandros slacken his fierceness, but yet more raged against the son"
11578,BOOK XXI.,"of Peleus, and he curled crestwise the billow of his stream, lifting"
11579,BOOK XXI.,"himself on high, and on Simoeis he called with a shout: “Dear brother,"
11580,BOOK XXI.,"the strength of this man let us both join to stay, since quickly he"
11581,BOOK XXI.,"will lay waste the great city of king Priam, and the Trojans abide not"
11582,BOOK XXI.,"in the battle. Help me with speed, and fill thy streams with water from"
11583,BOOK XXI.,"thy springs, and urge on all thy torrents, and raise up a great wave,"
11584,BOOK XXI.,"and stir huge roaring of tree-stumps and stones, that we may stay the"
11585,BOOK XXI.,"fierce man who now is lording it, and deeming himself match for gods."
11586,BOOK XXI.,"For neither, I ween, will strength avail him nor comeliness anywise,"
11587,BOOK XXI.,"nor that armour beautiful, which deep beneath the flood shall be"
11588,BOOK XXI.,"o’erlaid with slime, and himself I will wrap him in my sands and pour"
11589,BOOK XXI.,"round him countless shingle without stint, nor shall the Achaians know"
11590,BOOK XXI.,"where to gather his bones, so vast a shroud of silt will I heap over"
11591,BOOK XXI.,"them. Where he dieth there shall be his tomb, neither shall he have"
11592,BOOK XXI.,"need of any barrow to be raised, when the Achaians make his funeral.”"
11593,BOOK XXI.,
11594,BOOK XXI.,"He said, and rushed in tumult on Achilles, raging from on high,"
11595,BOOK XXI.,thundering with foam and blood and bodies of dead men. Then did a dark
11596,BOOK XXI.,wave of the heaven-sprung River stand towering up and overwhelm the son
11597,BOOK XXI.,"of Peleus. But Hera cried aloud in terror of Achilles, lest the great"
11598,BOOK XXI.,"deep-eddying River sweep him away, and straightway she called to"
11599,BOOK XXI.,"Hephaistos, her dear son: “Rise, lame god, O my son; it was against"
11600,BOOK XXI.,thee we thought that eddying Xanthos was matched in fight. Help with
11601,BOOK XXI.,"all speed, put forth large blast of flame. Then will I go to raise a"
11602,BOOK XXI.,strong storm out of the sea of the west wind and the white south which
11603,BOOK XXI.,"shall utterly consume the dead Trojans and their armour, blowing the"
11604,BOOK XXI.,angry flame. Thou along Xanthos’ banks burn up his trees and wrap
11605,BOOK XXI.,"himself in fire, nor let him anywise turn thee back by soft words or by"
11606,BOOK XXI.,"threat, nor stay thy rage—only when I cry to thee with my voice, then"
11607,BOOK XXI.,hold the unwearying fire.”
11608,BOOK XXI.,
11609,BOOK XXI.,"Thus spake she, and Hephaistos made ready fierce-blazing fire. First on"
11610,BOOK XXI.,"the plain fire blazed, and burnt the many dead who lay there thick,"
11611,BOOK XXI.,slain by Achilles; and all the plain was parched and the bright water
11612,BOOK XXI.,stayed. And as when in late summer the north wind swiftly parcheth a
11613,BOOK XXI.,"new watered orchard, and he that tilleth it is glad, thus was the whole"
11614,BOOK XXI.,"plain parched, and Hephaistos consumed the dead; then against the river"
11615,BOOK XXI.,he turned his gleaming flame. Elms burnt and willow trees and
11616,BOOK XXI.,"tamarisks, and lotos burnt and rush and galingale which round the fair"
11617,BOOK XXI.,streams of the river grew in multitude. And the eels and fishes beneath
11618,BOOK XXI.,"the eddies were afflicted, which through the fair streams tumbled this"
11619,BOOK XXI.,"way and that, in anguish at the blast of crafty Hephaistos. And the"
11620,BOOK XXI.,"strong River burned, and spake and called to him by name: “Hephaistos,"
11621,BOOK XXI.,"there is no god can match with thee, nor will I fight thee thus ablaze"
11622,BOOK XXI.,"with fire. Cease strife, yea, let noble Achilles drive the Trojans"
11623,BOOK XXI.,forthwith out of their city; what have I to do with strife and
11624,BOOK XXI.,succour?”
11625,BOOK XXI.,
11626,BOOK XXI.,"Thus spake he, burnt with fire, for his fair streams were bubbling. And"
11627,BOOK XXI.,"as a cauldron boileth within, beset with much fire, melting the lard of"
11628,BOOK XXI.,"some fatted hog spurting up on all sides, and logs of firewood lie"
11629,BOOK XXI.,"thereunder,—so burned his fair streams in the fire, and the water"
11630,BOOK XXI.,"boiled. He had no mind to flow, but refrained him, for the breath of"
11631,BOOK XXI.,"cunning Hephaistos violently afflicted him. Then unto Hera, earnestly"
11632,BOOK XXI.,"beseeching her,’ he spake winged words: “Hera, wherefore hath thy son"
11633,BOOK XXI.,assailed my stream to vex it above others? I am less chargeable than
11634,BOOK XXI.,"all the rest that are helpers of the Trojans. But lo, I will give over,"
11635,BOOK XXI.,"if thou wilt, and let thy son give over too. And I further will swear"
11636,BOOK XXI.,"even this, that never will I ward the day of evil from the Trojans, not"
11637,BOOK XXI.,"even when all Troy is burning in the blaze of hungry fire, and the"
11638,BOOK XXI.,warlike sons of Achaians are the burners thereof.”
11639,BOOK XXI.,
11640,BOOK XXI.,"Then when the white-armed goddess Hera heard his speech, straightway"
11641,BOOK XXI.,"she spake unto Hephaistos her dear son: “Hephaistos, hold, famed son;"
11642,BOOK XXI.,it befitteth not thus for mortals’ sake to do violence to an immortal
11643,BOOK XXI.,god.”
11644,BOOK XXI.,
11645,BOOK XXI.,"Thus said she and Hephaistos quenched the fierce-blazing fire, and the"
11646,BOOK XXI.,wave once more rolled down the fair river-bed.
11647,BOOK XXI.,
11648,BOOK XXI.,"So when the rage of Xanthos was overcome, both ceased, for Hera stayed"
11649,BOOK XXI.,"them, though in wrath. But among the other gods fell grievous bitter"
11650,BOOK XXI.,"strife, and their hearts were carried diverse in their breasts. And"
11651,BOOK XXI.,"they clashed together with a great noise, and the wide earth groaned,"
11652,BOOK XXI.,and the clarion of great Heaven rang around. Zeus heard as he sate upon
11653,BOOK XXI.,"Olympus, and his heart within him laughed pleasantly when he beheld"
11654,BOOK XXI.,"that strife of gods. Then no longer stood they asunder, for Ares"
11655,BOOK XXI.,piercer of shields began the battle and first made for Athene with his
11656,BOOK XXI.,"bronze spear, and spake a taunting word: “Wherefore, O dogfly, dost"
11657,BOOK XXI.,"thou match gods with gods in strife, with stormy daring, as thy great"
11658,BOOK XXI.,spirit moveth thee? Rememberest thou not how thou movedst Diomedes
11659,BOOK XXI.,"Tydeus’ son to wound me, and thyself didst take a visible spear and"
11660,BOOK XXI.,thrust it straight at me and pierce through my fair skin? Therefore
11661,BOOK XXI.,deem I now that thou shalt pay me for all that thou hast done.”
11662,BOOK XXI.,
11663,BOOK XXI.,Thus saying he smote on the dread tasselled aegis that not even the
11664,BOOK XXI.,lightning of Zeus can overcome—thereon smote bloodstained Ares with his
11665,BOOK XXI.,"long spear. But she, giving back, grasped with stout hand a stone that"
11666,BOOK XXI.,"lay upon the plain, black, rugged, huge, which men of old time set to"
11667,BOOK XXI.,"be the landmark of a field; this hurled she, and smote impetuous Ares"
11668,BOOK XXI.,"on the neck, and unstrung his limbs. Seven roods he covered in his"
11669,BOOK XXI.,"fall, and soiled his hair with dust, and his armour rang upon him. And"
11670,BOOK XXI.,"Pallas Athene laughed, and spake to him winged words exultingly: “Fool,"
11671,BOOK XXI.,"not even yet hast thou learnt how far better than thou I claim to be,"
11672,BOOK XXI.,that thus thou matchest thy might with mine. Thus shalt thou satisfy
11673,BOOK XXI.,"thy mother’s curses, who deviseth mischief against thee in her wrath,"
11674,BOOK XXI.,for that thou hast left the Achaians and givest the proud Trojan’s
11675,BOOK XXI.,aid.”
11676,BOOK XXI.,
11677,BOOK XXI.,Thus having said she turned from him her shining eyes. Him did
11678,BOOK XXI.,"Aphrodite daughter of Zeus take by the hand and lead away, groaning"
11679,BOOK XXI.,"continually, for scarce gathered he his spirit back to him. But when"
11680,BOOK XXI.,"the white-armed goddess Hera was aware of them, straightway she spake"
11681,BOOK XXI.,"unto Athene winged words: “Out on it, child of aegis-bearing Zeus,"
11682,BOOK XXI.,"maiden invincible, lo there the dogfly is leading Ares destroyer of men"
11683,BOOK XXI.,"out of the fray of battle down the throng—nay then, pursue her.”"
11684,BOOK XXI.,
11685,BOOK XXI.,"She said, and Athene sped after her with heart exultant, and made at"
11686,BOOK XXI.,"her and smote her with stout hand upon the breast, and straightway her"
11687,BOOK XXI.,knees and heart were unstrung. So they twain lay on the bounteous
11688,BOOK XXI.,"earth, and she spake winged words exultingly: “Such let all be who give"
11689,BOOK XXI.,the Trojans aid when they fight against the mailed Argives. Be they
11690,BOOK XXI.,even so bold and brave as Aphrodite when she came to succour Ares and
11691,BOOK XXI.,"defied my might. Then should we long ago have ceased from war, having"
11692,BOOK XXI.,laid waste the stablished citadel of Ilios.”
11693,BOOK XXI.,
11694,BOOK XXI.,"[She said, and the white-armed goddess Hera smiled.] Then to Apollo"
11695,BOOK XXI.,"spake the earth-shaking lord: “Phoebus, why stand we apart? It"
11696,BOOK XXI.,befitteth not after the rest have begun: that were the more shameful if
11697,BOOK XXI.,without fighting we should go to Olympus to the bronze-thresholded
11698,BOOK XXI.,"house of Zeus. Begin, for thou art younger; it were not meet for me,"
11699,BOOK XXI.,"since I was born first and know more. Fond god, how foolish is thy"
11700,BOOK XXI.,heart! Thou rememberest not all the ills we twain alone of gods endured
11701,BOOK XXI.,"at Ilios, when by ordinance of Zeus we came to proud Laomedon and"
11702,BOOK XXI.,"served him through a year for promised recompense, and he laid on us"
11703,BOOK XXI.,"his commands. I round their city built the Trojans a wall, wide and"
11704,BOOK XXI.,"most fair, that the city might be unstormed, and thou Phoebus, didst"
11705,BOOK XXI.,herd shambling crook-horned kine among the spurs of woody many-folded
11706,BOOK XXI.,"Ida. But when the joyous seasons were accomplishing the term of hire,"
11707,BOOK XXI.,"then redoubtable Laomedon robbed us of all hire, and sent us off with"
11708,BOOK XXI.,threats. He threatened that he would bind together our feet and hands
11709,BOOK XXI.,"and sell us into far-off isles, and the ears of both of us he vowed to"
11710,BOOK XXI.,"shear off with the sword. So we went home with angry hearts, wroth for"
11711,BOOK XXI.,the hire he promised and gave us not. To his folk not thou showest
11712,BOOK XXI.,"favour, nor essayest with us how the proud Trojans may be brought low"
11713,BOOK XXI.,and perish miserably with their children and noble wives.”
11714,BOOK XXI.,
11715,BOOK XXI.,"Then to him answered King Apollo the Far-darter: “Shaker of the earth,"
11716,BOOK XXI.,of no sound mind wouldst thou repute me if I should fight against thee
11717,BOOK XXI.,"for the sake of pitiful mortals, who like unto leaves now live in"
11718,BOOK XXI.,"glowing life, consuming the fruit of the earth, and now again pine into"
11719,BOOK XXI.,"death. Let us with all speed cease from combat, and let them do battle"
11720,BOOK XXI.,by themselves.”
11721,BOOK XXI.,
11722,BOOK XXI.,"Thus saying he turned away, for he felt shame to deal in blows with his"
11723,BOOK XXI.,"father’s brother. But his sister upbraided him sore, the queen of wild"
11724,BOOK XXI.,"beasts, huntress Artemis, and spake a taunting word: “So then thou"
11725,BOOK XXI.,"fleest, Far-darter, hast quite yielded to Poseidon the victory, and"
11726,BOOK XXI.,"given him glory for naught! Fond god, why bearest thou an ineffectual"
11727,BOOK XXI.,bow in vain? Let me not hear thee again in the halls of our sire boast
11728,BOOK XXI.,as before among the immortal gods thou wouldst stand up to fight
11729,BOOK XXI.,against Poseidon.”
11730,BOOK XXI.,
11731,BOOK XXI.,"Thus spake she, but far-darting Apollo answered her not. But angrily"
11732,BOOK XXI.,the noble spouse of Zeus [upbraided the Archer Queen with taunting
11733,BOOK XXI.,"words:] “How now art thou fain, bold vixen, to set thyself against me?"
11734,BOOK XXI.,"Hard were it for thee to match my might, bow-bearer though thou art,"
11735,BOOK XXI.,"since against women Zeus made thee a lion, and giveth thee to slay"
11736,BOOK XXI.,whomso of them thou wilt. Truly it is better on the mountains to slay
11737,BOOK XXI.,wild beasts and deer than to fight amain with mightier than thou. But
11738,BOOK XXI.,"if thou wilt, try war, that thou mayest know well how far stronger am"
11739,BOOK XXI.,"I, since thou matchest thy might with mine.”"
11740,BOOK XXI.,
11741,BOOK XXI.,"She said, and with her left hand caught both the other’s hands by the"
11742,BOOK XXI.,"wrist, and with her right took the bow from off her shoulders, and"
11743,BOOK XXI.,"therewith, smiling, beat her on the ears as she turned this way and"
11744,BOOK XXI.,that; and the swift arrows fell out of her quiver. And weeping from
11745,BOOK XXI.,before her the goddess fled like a dove that from before a falcon
11746,BOOK XXI.,"flieth to a hollow rock, a cleft—for she was not fated to be"
11747,BOOK XXI.,"caught;—thus Artemis fled weeping, and left her bow and arrows where"
11748,BOOK XXI.,"they lay. Then to Leto spake the Guide, the slayer of Argus: “Leto,"
11749,BOOK XXI.,with thee will I no wise fight; a grievous thing it is to come to blows
11750,BOOK XXI.,with wives of cloud-gathering Zeus; but boast to thy heart’s content
11751,BOOK XXI.,among the immortal gods that thou didst vanquish me by might and main.”
11752,BOOK XXI.,
11753,BOOK XXI.,"Thus said he, and Leto gathered up the curved bow and arrows fallen"
11754,BOOK XXI.,hither and thither amid the whirl of dust: so taking her daughter’s bow
11755,BOOK XXI.,"she went back. And the maiden came to Olympus, to the"
11756,BOOK XXI.,"bronze-thresholded house of Zeus, and weeping set herself on her"
11757,BOOK XXI.,"father’s knee, while round her her divine vesture quivered: and her"
11758,BOOK XXI.,"father, Kronos’ son, took her to him and asked of her, laughing gently:"
11759,BOOK XXI.,"“Who of the inhabitants of heaven, dear child, hath dealt with thee"
11760,BOOK XXI.,"thus [hastily, as though thou hadst been doing some wrong thing"
11761,BOOK XXI.,openly]?”
11762,BOOK XXI.,
11763,BOOK XXI.,And to him in answer spake the fair-crowned queen of the echoing chase:
11764,BOOK XXI.,"“It was thy wife that buffeted me, father, the white-armed Hera, from"
11765,BOOK XXI.,whom are strife and contention come upon the immortals.”
11766,BOOK XXI.,
11767,BOOK XXI.,Thus talked they unto one another. Then Phoebus Apollo entered into
11768,BOOK XXI.,"sacred Ilios, for he was troubled for the wall of the well-builded"
11769,BOOK XXI.,"city, lest the Danaans waste it before its hour upon that day. But the"
11770,BOOK XXI.,"other ever-living gods went to Olympus, some angry and some greatly"
11771,BOOK XXI.,"triumphing, and sat down beside Zeus who hideth himself in dark clouds."
11772,BOOK XXI.,
11773,BOOK XXI.,"Now Achilles was still slaying the Trojans, both themselves and their"
11774,BOOK XXI.,"whole-hooved horses. And as when a smoke goeth up to the broad heaven,"
11775,BOOK XXI.,"when a city burneth, kindled by the wrath of gods, and causeth toil to"
11776,BOOK XXI.,"all, and griefs to many, thus caused Achilles toil and griefs to the"
11777,BOOK XXI.,"Trojans. And the old man Priam stood on the sacred tower, and was aware"
11778,BOOK XXI.,"of dread Achilles, how before him the Trojans thronged in rout, nor was"
11779,BOOK XXI.,"any succour found of them. Then with a cry he went down from the tower,"
11780,BOOK XXI.,to rouse the gallant warders along the walls: “Hold open the gates in
11781,BOOK XXI.,"your hands until the folk come to the city in their rout, for closely"
11782,BOOK XXI.,is Achilles chasing them—now trow I there will be deadly deeds. And
11783,BOOK XXI.,"when they are gathered within the wall and are taking breath, then"
11784,BOOK XXI.,again shut back the gate-wings firmly builded; for I fear lest that
11785,BOOK XXI.,murderous man spring in within the wall.”
11786,BOOK XXI.,
11787,BOOK XXI.,"Thus spake he, and they opened the gates and thrust back the bolts; and"
11788,BOOK XXI.,the gates flung back gave safety. Then Apollo leapt forth to the front
11789,BOOK XXI.,that he might ward destruction from the Trojans. They straight for the
11790,BOOK XXI.,"city and the high wall were fleeing, parched with thirst and"
11791,BOOK XXI.,"dust-grimed from the plain, and Achilles chased them vehemently with"
11792,BOOK XXI.,"his spear, for strong frenzy possessed his heart continually, and he"
11793,BOOK XXI.,thirsted to win him renown. Then would the sons of the Achaians have
11794,BOOK XXI.,"taken high-gated Troy, had not Phoebus Apollo aroused goodly Agenor,"
11795,BOOK XXI.,"Antenor’s son, a princely man and strong. In his heart he put good"
11796,BOOK XXI.,"courage, and himself stood by his side that he might ward off the"
11797,BOOK XXI.,"grievous visitations of death, leaning against the oak, and he was"
11798,BOOK XXI.,shrouded in thick mist. So when Agenor was aware of Achilles waster of
11799,BOOK XXI.,"cities, he halted, and his heart much wavered as he stood; and in"
11800,BOOK XXI.,"trouble he spake to his great heart: “Ay me, if I flee before mighty"
11801,BOOK XXI.,"Achilles, there where the rest are driven terror-struck, nathless will"
11802,BOOK XXI.,he overtake me and slaughter me as a coward. Or what if I leave these
11803,BOOK XXI.,"to be driven before Achilles the son of Peleus, and flee upon my feet"
11804,BOOK XXI.,"from the wall by another way to the Ileian plain, until I come to the"
11805,BOOK XXI.,"spurs of Ida, and hide me in the underwood? So then at evening, having"
11806,BOOK XXI.,"bathed in the river and refreshed me of sweat, I might return to Ilios."
11807,BOOK XXI.,"Nay, why doth my heart debate thus within me? Lest he might be aware of"
11808,BOOK XXI.,"me as I get me from the city for the plain, and speeding after overtake"
11809,BOOK XXI.,me with swift feet; then will it no more be possible to avoid the
11810,BOOK XXI.,"visitation of death, for he is exceeding mighty above all mankind. What"
11811,BOOK XXI.,then if in front of the city I go forth to meet him? Surely his flesh
11812,BOOK XXI.,"too is penetrable by sharp bronze, and there is but one life within,"
11813,BOOK XXI.,"and men say he is mortal, howbeit Zeus the son of Kronos giveth him"
11814,BOOK XXI.,renown.”
11815,BOOK XXI.,
11816,BOOK XXI.,"Thus saying, he gathered himself to await Achilles, and within him his"
11817,BOOK XXI.,stout heart was set to strive and fight. As a leopardess goeth forth
11818,BOOK XXI.,"from a deep thicket to affront a huntsman, nor is afraid at heart, nor"
11819,BOOK XXI.,fleeth when she heareth the bay of hounds; for albeit the man first
11820,BOOK XXI.,"smite her with thrust or throw, yet even pierced through with the spear"
11821,BOOK XXI.,"she ceaseth not from her courage until she either grapple or be slain,"
11822,BOOK XXI.,"so noble Antenor’s son, goodly Agenor, refused to flee till he should"
11823,BOOK XXI.,"put Achilles to the proof, but held before him the circle of his"
11824,BOOK XXI.,"shield, and aimed at him with his spear, and cried aloud: “Doubtless"
11825,BOOK XXI.,"thou hopest in thy heart, noble Achilles, on this day to sack the city"
11826,BOOK XXI.,"of the proud men of Troy. Fond man, there shall many woful things yet"
11827,BOOK XXI.,"be wrought before it, for within it we are many men and staunch, who in"
11828,BOOK XXI.,front of our parents dear and wives and sons keep Ilios safe; but thou
11829,BOOK XXI.,"shalt here meet death, albeit so redoubtable and bold a man of war.”"
11830,BOOK XXI.,
11831,BOOK XXI.,"He said, and hurled his sharp spear with weighty hand, and smote him on"
11832,BOOK XXI.,"the leg beneath the knee, nor missed his mark, and the greave of"
11833,BOOK XXI.,new-wrought tin rang terribly on him; but the bronze bounded back from
11834,BOOK XXI.,"him it smote, nor pierced him, for the god’s gift drave it back. Then"
11835,BOOK XXI.,"the son of Peleus in his turn made at godlike Agenor, but Apollo"
11836,BOOK XXI.,"suffered him not to win renown, but caught away Agenor, and shrouded"
11837,BOOK XXI.,"him in thick mist, and sent him in peace to be gone out of the war."
11838,BOOK XXI.,"Then by wile kept the son of Peleus away from the folk, for in complete"
11839,BOOK XXI.,"semblance of Agenor himself he stood before the feet of Achilles, who"
11840,BOOK XXI.,hasted to run upon him and chase him. And while he chased him over the
11841,BOOK XXI.,"wheat-bearing plain, edging him toward the deep-eddying river"
11842,BOOK XXI.,"Skamandros, as he ran but a little in front of him (for by wile Apollo"
11843,BOOK XXI.,"beguiled him that he kept ever hoping to overtake him in the race),"
11844,BOOK XXI.,meantime the other Trojans in common rout came gladly unto their
11845,BOOK XXI.,"fastness, and the city was filled with the throng of them. Neither had"
11846,BOOK XXI.,"they heart to await one another outside the city and wall, and to know"
11847,BOOK XXI.,"who might have escaped and who had perished in the fight, but"
11848,BOOK XXI.,"impetuously they poured into the city, whomsoever of them his feet and"
11849,BOOK XXI.,knees might save.
11850,BOOK XXI.,
11851,BOOK XXI.,
11852,BOOK XXI.,
11853,BOOK XXI.,
11854,BOOK XXII.,BOOK XXII.
11855,BOOK XXII.,
11856,BOOK XXII.,
11857,BOOK XXII.,"How Achilles fought with Hector, and slew him, and brought his body to"
11858,BOOK XXII.,the ships.
11859,BOOK XXII.,
11860,BOOK XXII.,
11861,BOOK XXII.,"Thus they throughout the city, scared like fawns, were cooling their"
11862,BOOK XXII.,"sweat and drinking and slaking their thirst, leaning on the fair"
11863,BOOK XXII.,"battlements, while the Achaians drew near the wall, setting shields to"
11864,BOOK XXII.,"shoulders. But Hector deadly fate bound to abide in his place, in front"
11865,BOOK XXII.,of Ilios and the Skaian gates. Then to the son of Peleus spake Phoebus
11866,BOOK XXII.,"Apollo: “Wherefore, son of Peleus, pursuest thou me with swift feet,"
11867,BOOK XXII.,thyself being mortal and I a deathless god? Thou hast not even yet
11868,BOOK XXII.,"known me, that I am a god, but strivest vehemently. Truly thou"
11869,BOOK XXII.,regardest not thy task among the affliction of the Trojans whom thou
11870,BOOK XXII.,"affrightedst, who now are gathered into the city, while thou heat"
11871,BOOK XXII.,"wandered hither. Me thou wilt never slay, for I am not subject unto"
11872,BOOK XXII.,death.”
11873,BOOK XXII.,
11874,BOOK XXII.,Then mightily moved spake unto him Achilles fleet of foot: “Thou hast
11875,BOOK XXII.,"baulked me, Far-darter, most mischievous of all the gods, in that thou"
11876,BOOK XXII.,hast turned me hither from the wall: else should full many yet have
11877,BOOK XXII.,bitten the dust or ever within Ilios had they come. Now hast thou
11878,BOOK XXII.,"robbed me of great renown, and lightly hast saved them, because thou"
11879,BOOK XXII.,hadst no vengeance to fear thereafter. Verily I would avenge me on
11880,BOOK XXII.,"thee, had I but the power.”"
11881,BOOK XXII.,
11882,BOOK XXII.,"Thus saying toward the city he was gone in pride of heart, rushing like"
11883,BOOK XXII.,"some victorious horse in a chariot, that runneth lightly at full speed"
11884,BOOK XXII.,over the plain; so swiftly plied Achilles his feet and knees. Him the
11885,BOOK XXII.,"old man Priam first beheld as he sped across the plain, blazing as the"
11886,BOOK XXII.,"star that cometh forth at harvest-time, and plain seen his rays shine"
11887,BOOK XXII.,"forth amid the host of stars in the darkness of night, the star whose"
11888,BOOK XXII.,"name men call Orion’s Dog. Brightest of all is he, yet for an evil sign"
11889,BOOK XXII.,"is he set, and bringeth much fever upon hapless men. Even so on"
11890,BOOK XXII.,Achilles’ breast the bronze gleamed as he ran. And the old man cried
11891,BOOK XXII.,"aloud and beat upon his head with his hands, raising them on high, and"
11892,BOOK XXII.,with a cry called aloud beseeching his dear son; for he before the
11893,BOOK XXII.,"gates was standing, all hot for battle with Achilles. And the old man"
11894,BOOK XXII.,"spake piteously unto him, stretching forth his hands: “Hector, beloved"
11895,BOOK XXII.,"son, I pray thee await not this man alone with none beside thee, lest"
11896,BOOK XXII.,"thou quickly meet thy doom, slain by the son of Peleus, since he is"
11897,BOOK XXII.,"mightier far, a merciless man. Would the gods loved him even as do I!"
11898,BOOK XXII.,then quickly would dogs and vultures devour him on the field—thereby
11899,BOOK XXII.,would cruel pain go from my heart—the man who hath bereft me of many
11900,BOOK XXII.,"valiant sons, slaying them and selling them captive into far-off isles."
11901,BOOK XXII.,"Ay even now twain of my children, Lykaon and Polydoros, I cannot see"
11902,BOOK XXII.,"among the Trojans that throng into the fastness, sons whom Laothoe bare"
11903,BOOK XXII.,"me, a princess among women. If they be yet alive amid the enemy’s host,"
11904,BOOK XXII.,"then will we ransom them with bronze and gold, for there is store"
11905,BOOK XXII.,"within, for much goods gave the old man famous Altes to his child. If"
11906,BOOK XXII.,"they be dead, then even in the house of Hades shall they be a sorrow to"
11907,BOOK XXII.,"my soul and to their mother, even to us who gave them birth, but to the"
11908,BOOK XXII.,"rest of the folk a briefer sorrow, if but thou die not by Achilles’"
11909,BOOK XXII.,"hand. Nay, come within the wall, my child, that thou preserve the men"
11910,BOOK XXII.,"and women of Troy, neither give great triumph to the son of Peleus, and"
11911,BOOK XXII.,"be thyself bereft of sweet life. Have compassion also on me, the"
11912,BOOK XXII.,"helpless one, who still can feel, ill-fated; whom the father, Kronos’"
11913,BOOK XXII.,"son, will bring to naught by a grievous doom in the path of old age,"
11914,BOOK XXII.,"having seen full many ills, his sons perishing and his daughters"
11915,BOOK XXII.,"carried away captive, and his chambers laid waste and infant children"
11916,BOOK XXII.,"hurled to the ground in terrible war, and his sons’ wives dragged away"
11917,BOOK XXII.,by the ruinous hands of the Achaians. Myself then last of all at the
11918,BOOK XXII.,"street door will ravening dogs tear, when some one by stroke or throw"
11919,BOOK XXII.,of the sharp bronze hath bereft my limbs of life—even the dogs I reared
11920,BOOK XXII.,"in my halls about my table and to guard my door, which then having"
11921,BOOK XXII.,"drunk my blood, maddened at heart shall lie in the gateway. A young man"
11922,BOOK XXII.,"all beseemeth, even to be slain in war, to be torn by the sharp bronze"
11923,BOOK XXII.,"and lie on the field; though he be dead yet is all honourable to him,"
11924,BOOK XXII.,whate’er be seen: but when dogs defile the hoary head and hoary beard
11925,BOOK XXII.,"of an old man slain, this is the most piteous thing that cometh upon"
11926,BOOK XXII.,hapless men.”
11927,BOOK XXII.,
11928,BOOK XXII.,"Thus spake the old man, and grasped his hoary hairs, plucking them from"
11929,BOOK XXII.,"his head, but he persuaded not Hector’s soul. Then his mother in her"
11930,BOOK XXII.,"turn wailed tearfully, loosening the folds of her robe, while with the"
11931,BOOK XXII.,other hand she showed her breast; and through her tears spake to him
11932,BOOK XXII.,"winged words: “Hector, my child, have regard unto this bosom and pity"
11933,BOOK XXII.,"me, if ever I gave thee consolation of my breast. Think of it, dear"
11934,BOOK XXII.,"child, and from this side the wall drive back the foe, nor stand in"
11935,BOOK XXII.,front to meet him. He is merciless; if he slay thee it will not be on a
11936,BOOK XXII.,"bed that I or thy wife shall bewail thee, my own dear child, but far"
11937,BOOK XXII.,away from us by the ships of the Argives will swift dogs devour thee.”
11938,BOOK XXII.,
11939,BOOK XXII.,"Thus they with wailing spake to their dear son, beseeching him sore,"
11940,BOOK XXII.,"yet they persuaded not Hector’s soul, but he stood awaiting Achilles as"
11941,BOOK XXII.,he drew nigh in giant might. As a serpent of the mountains upon his den
11942,BOOK XXII.,"awaiteth a man, having fed on evil poisons, and fell wrath hath entered"
11943,BOOK XXII.,"into him, and terribly he glared as he coileth himself about his den,"
11944,BOOK XXII.,"so Hector with courage unquenchable gave not back, leaning his shining"
11945,BOOK XXII.,shield against a jutting tower. Then sore troubled he spake to his
11946,BOOK XXII.,"great heart: “Ay me, if I go within the gates and walls, Polydamas will"
11947,BOOK XXII.,"be first to bring reproach against me, since he bade me lead the"
11948,BOOK XXII.,"Trojans to the city during this ruinous night, when noble Achilles"
11949,BOOK XXII.,"arose. But I regarded him not, yet surely it had been better far. And"
11950,BOOK XXII.,"now that I have undone the host by my wantonness, I am ashamed before"
11951,BOOK XXII.,"the men of Troy and women of trailing robes, lest at any time some"
11952,BOOK XXII.,worse man than I shall say: ‘Hector by trusting his own might undid the
11953,BOOK XXII.,host.’ So will they speak; then to me would it be better far to face
11954,BOOK XXII.,"Achilles and either slay him and go home, or myself die gloriously"
11955,BOOK XXII.,before the city. Or what if I lay down my bossy shield and my stout
11956,BOOK XXII.,"helm, and lean my spear against the wall, and go of myself to meet"
11957,BOOK XXII.,"noble Achilles and promise him that Helen, and with her all possessions"
11958,BOOK XXII.,"that Alexandros brought in hollow ships to Troy, the beginning of"
11959,BOOK XXII.,"strife, we will give to the Sons of Atreus to take away, and"
11960,BOOK XXII.,therewithal to divide in half with the Achaians all else that this city
11961,BOOK XXII.,holdeth: and if thereafter I obtain from the Trojans an oath of the
11962,BOOK XXII.,Elders that they will hide nothing but divide all in twain [whatever
11963,BOOK XXII.,wealth the pleasant city hold within]? But wherefore doth my heart
11964,BOOK XXII.,debate thus? I might come unto him and he would not pity or regard me
11965,BOOK XXII.,"at all, but presently slay me unarmed as it were but a woman, if I put"
11966,BOOK XXII.,off my armour. No time is it now to dally with him from oaktree or from
11967,BOOK XXII.,"rock, like youth with maiden, as youth and maiden hold dalliance one"
11968,BOOK XXII.,with another. Better is it to join battle with all speed: let us know
11969,BOOK XXII.,upon which of us twain the Olympian shall bestow renown.”
11970,BOOK XXII.,
11971,BOOK XXII.,"Thus pondered he as he stood, but nigh on him came Achilles, peer of"
11972,BOOK XXII.,"Enyalios warrior of the waving helm, brandishing from his right"
11973,BOOK XXII.,"shoulder the Pelian ash, his terrible spear; and all around the bronze"
11974,BOOK XXII.,on him flashed like the gleam of blazing fire or of the Sun as he
11975,BOOK XXII.,"ariseth. And trembling seized Hector as he was aware of him, nor"
11976,BOOK XXII.,"endured he to abide in his place, but left the gates behind him and"
11977,BOOK XXII.,"fled in fear. And the son of Peleus darted after him, trusting in his"
11978,BOOK XXII.,"swift feet. As a falcon upon the mountains, swiftest of winged things,"
11979,BOOK XXII.,"swoopeth fleetly after a trembling dove; and she before him fleeth,"
11980,BOOK XXII.,"while he with shrill screams hard at hand still darteth at her, for his"
11981,BOOK XXII.,heart urgeth him to seize her; so Achilles in hot haste flew straight
11982,BOOK XXII.,"for him, and Hector fled beneath the Trojans’ wall, and plied swift"
11983,BOOK XXII.,knees. They past the watch-place and wind-waved wild fig-tree sped
11984,BOOK XXII.,"ever, away from under the wall, along the waggon-track, and came to the"
11985,BOOK XXII.,"two fair-flowing springs, where two fountains rise that feed"
11986,BOOK XXII.,"deep-eddying Skamandros. The one floweth with warm water, and smoke"
11987,BOOK XXII.,"goeth up therefrom around as it were from a blazing fire, while the"
11988,BOOK XXII.,other even in summer floweth forth like cold hail or snow or ice that
11989,BOOK XXII.,water formeth. And there beside the springs are broad washing-troughs
11990,BOOK XXII.,"hard by, fair troughs of stone, where wives and fair daughters of the"
11991,BOOK XXII.,"men of Troy were wont to wash bright raiment, in the old time of peace,"
11992,BOOK XXII.,"before the sons of the Achaians came. Thereby they ran, he flying, he"
11993,BOOK XXII.,pursuing. Valiant was the flier but far mightier he who fleetly pursued
11994,BOOK XXII.,him. For not for beast of sacrifice or for an oxhide were they
11995,BOOK XXII.,"striving, such as are prizes for men’s speed of foot, but for the life"
11996,BOOK XXII.,of horse-taming Hector was their race. And as when victorious
11997,BOOK XXII.,"whole-hooved horses run rapidly round the turning-points, and some"
11998,BOOK XXII.,"great prize lieth in sight, be it a tripod or a woman, in honour of a"
11999,BOOK XXII.,"man that is dead, so thrice around Priam’s city circled those twain"
12000,BOOK XXII.,"with flying feet, and all the gods were gazing on them. Then among them"
12001,BOOK XXII.,"spake first the father of gods and men: “Ay me, a man beloved I see"
12002,BOOK XXII.,"pursued around the wall. My heart is woe for Hector, who hath burnt for"
12003,BOOK XXII.,"me many thighs of oxen amid the crests of many-folded Ida, and other"
12004,BOOK XXII.,times on the city-height; but now is goodly Achilles pursuing him with
12005,BOOK XXII.,"swift feet round Priam’s town. Come, give your counsel, gods, and"
12006,BOOK XXII.,"devise whether we shall save him from death or now at last slay him,"
12007,BOOK XXII.,"valiant though he be, by the hand of Achilles Peleus’ son.”"
12008,BOOK XXII.,
12009,BOOK XXII.,"Then to him answered the bright-eyed goddess Athene: “O Father, Lord of"
12010,BOOK XXII.,"the bright lightning and the dark cloud, what is this thou hast said? A"
12011,BOOK XXII.,"man that is a mortal, doomed long ago by fate, wouldst thou redeem back"
12012,BOOK XXII.,"from ill-boding death? Do it, but not all we other gods approve.”"
12013,BOOK XXII.,
12014,BOOK XXII.,"And unto her in answer spake cloud-gathering Zeus: “Be of good cheer,"
12015,BOOK XXII.,"Trito-born, dear child: not in full earnest speak I, and I would fain"
12016,BOOK XXII.,"be kind to thee. Do as seemeth good to thy mind, and draw not back.”"
12017,BOOK XXII.,
12018,BOOK XXII.,"Thus saying he roused Athene, that already was set thereon, and from"
12019,BOOK XXII.,the crests of Olympus she darted down.
12020,BOOK XXII.,
12021,BOOK XXII.,But after Hector sped fleet Achilles chasing him vehemently. And as
12022,BOOK XXII.,"when on the mountains a hound hunteth the fawn of a deer, having"
12023,BOOK XXII.,"started it from its covert, through glens and glades, and if it crouch"
12024,BOOK XXII.,"to baffle him under a bush, yet scenting it out the hound runneth"
12025,BOOK XXII.,constantly until he find it; so Hector baffled not Peleus’ fleet-footed
12026,BOOK XXII.,son. Oft as he set himself to dart under the well-built walls over
12027,BOOK XXII.,"against the Dardanian gates, if haply from above they might succour him"
12028,BOOK XXII.,"with darts, so oft would Achilles gain on him and turn him toward the"
12029,BOOK XXII.,"plain, while himself he sped ever on the city-side. And as in a dream"
12030,BOOK XXII.,"one faileth in chase of a flying man, the one faileth in his flight and"
12031,BOOK XXII.,"the other in his chase—so failed Achilles to overtake him in the race,"
12032,BOOK XXII.,and Hector to escape. And thus would Hector have avoided the visitation
12033,BOOK XXII.,"of death, had not this time been utterly the last wherein Apollo came"
12034,BOOK XXII.,"nigh to him, who nerved his strength and his swift knees. For to the"
12035,BOOK XXII.,"host did noble Achilles sign with his head, and forbade them to hurl"
12036,BOOK XXII.,"bitter darts against Hector, lest any smiting him should gain renown,"
12037,BOOK XXII.,and he himself come second. But when the fourth time they had reached
12038,BOOK XXII.,"the springs, then the Father hung his golden balances, and set therein"
12039,BOOK XXII.,"two lots of dreary death, one of Achilles, one of horse-taming Hector,"
12040,BOOK XXII.,and held them by the midst and poised. Then Hector’s fated day sank
12041,BOOK XXII.,"down, and fell to the house of Hades, and Phoebus Apollo left him. But"
12042,BOOK XXII.,"to Peleus’ son came the bright-eyed goddess Athene, and standing near"
12043,BOOK XXII.,"spake to him winged words: “Now verily, glorious Achilles dear to Zeus,"
12044,BOOK XXII.,I have hope that we twain shall carry off great glory to the ships for
12045,BOOK XXII.,"the Achaians, having slain Hector, for all his thirst for fight. No"
12046,BOOK XXII.,"longer is it possible for him to escape us, not even though far-darting"
12047,BOOK XXII.,"Apollo should travail sore, grovelling before the Father, aegis-bearing"
12048,BOOK XXII.,"Zeus. But do thou now stand and take breath, and I will go and persuade"
12049,BOOK XXII.,this man to confront thee in fight.”
12050,BOOK XXII.,
12051,BOOK XXII.,"Thus spake Athene, and he obeyed, and was glad at heart, and stood"
12052,BOOK XXII.,leaning on his bronze-pointed ashen-spear. And she left him and came to
12053,BOOK XXII.,"noble Hector, like unto Deiphobos in shape and in strong voice, and"
12054,BOOK XXII.,"standing near spake to him winged words: “Dear brother, verily fleet"
12055,BOOK XXII.,"Achilles doth thee violence, chasing thee round Priam’s town with swift"
12056,BOOK XXII.,feet: but come let us make a stand and await him on our defence.”
12057,BOOK XXII.,
12058,BOOK XXII.,"Then answered her great Hector of the glancing helm: “Deiphobos, verily"
12059,BOOK XXII.,"aforetime wert thou far dearest of my brothers, but now methinks I"
12060,BOOK XXII.,"shall honour thee even more, in that thou hast dared for my sake, when"
12061,BOOK XXII.,"thou sawest me, to come forth of the wall, while the others tarry"
12062,BOOK XXII.,within.”
12063,BOOK XXII.,
12064,BOOK XXII.,"Then to him again spake the bright-eyed goddess Athene: “Dear brother,"
12065,BOOK XXII.,of a truth my father and lady mother and my comrades around besought me
12066,BOOK XXII.,"much, entreating me in turn, to tarry there, so greatly do they all"
12067,BOOK XXII.,tremble before him; but my heart within was sore with dismal grief. And
12068,BOOK XXII.,now fight we with straight-set resolve and let there be no sparing of
12069,BOOK XXII.,"spears, that we may know whether Achilles is to slay us and carry our"
12070,BOOK XXII.,"bloody spoils to the hollow ships, or whether he might be vanquished by"
12071,BOOK XXII.,thy spear.”
12072,BOOK XXII.,
12073,BOOK XXII.,Thus saying Athene in her subtlety led him on. And when they were come
12074,BOOK XXII.,"nigh in onset on one another, to Achilles first spake great Hector of"
12075,BOOK XXII.,"the glancing helm: “No longer, son of Peleus, will I fly thee, as"
12076,BOOK XXII.,"before I thrice ran round the great town of Priam, and endured not to"
12077,BOOK XXII.,await thy onset. Now my heart biddeth me stand up against thee; I will
12078,BOOK XXII.,either slay or be slain. But come hither and let us pledge us by our
12079,BOOK XXII.,"gods, for they shall be best witnesses and beholders of covenants: I"
12080,BOOK XXII.,"will entreat thee in no outrageous sort, if Zeus grant me to outstay"
12081,BOOK XXII.,"thee, and if I take thy life, but when I have despoiled thee of thy"
12082,BOOK XXII.,"glorious armour, O Achilles, I will give back thy dead body to the"
12083,BOOK XXII.,"Achaians, and do thou the same.”"
12084,BOOK XXII.,
12085,BOOK XXII.,"But unto him with grim gaze spake Achilles fleet of foot: “Hector, talk"
12086,BOOK XXII.,"not to me, thou madman, of covenants. As between men and lions there is"
12087,BOOK XXII.,"no pledge of faith, nor wolves and sheep can be of one mind, but"
12088,BOOK XXII.,"imagine evil continually against each other, so is it impossible for"
12089,BOOK XXII.,"thee and me to be friends, neither shall be any pledge between us until"
12090,BOOK XXII.,"one or other shall have fallen and glutted with blood Ares, the"
12091,BOOK XXII.,stubborn god of war. Bethink thee of all thy soldiership: now behoveth
12092,BOOK XXII.,it thee to quit thee as a good spearman and valiant man of war. No
12093,BOOK XXII.,"longer is there way of escape for thee, but Pallas Athene will"
12094,BOOK XXII.,straightway subdue thee to my spear; and now in one hour shalt thou pay
12095,BOOK XXII.,back for all my sorrows for my friends whom thou hast slain in the fury
12096,BOOK XXII.,of thy spear.”
12097,BOOK XXII.,
12098,BOOK XXII.,"He said, and poised his far-shadowing spear and hurled. And noble"
12099,BOOK XXII.,Hector watched the coming thereof and avoided it; for with his eye on
12100,BOOK XXII.,"it he crouched, and the bronze spear flew over him, and fixed itself in"
12101,BOOK XXII.,"the earth; but Pallas Athene caught it up and gave it back to Achilles,"
12102,BOOK XXII.,unknown of Hector shepherd of hosts. Then Hector spake unto the noble
12103,BOOK XXII.,"son of Peleus: “Thou hast missed, so no wise yet, godlike Achilles, has"
12104,BOOK XXII.,"thou known from Zeus the hour of my doom, though thou thoughtest it."
12105,BOOK XXII.,"Cunning of tongue art thou and a deceiver in speech, that fearing thee"
12106,BOOK XXII.,I might forget my valour and strength. Not as I flee shalt thou plant
12107,BOOK XXII.,"thy spear in my reins, but drive it straight through my breast as I set"
12108,BOOK XXII.,"on thee, if God hath given thee to do it. Now in thy turn avoid my"
12109,BOOK XXII.,spear of bronze. O that thou mightst take it all into thy flesh! Then
12110,BOOK XXII.,"would the war be lighter to the Trojans, if but thou wert dead, for"
12111,BOOK XXII.,thou art their greatest bane.”
12112,BOOK XXII.,
12113,BOOK XXII.,"He said, and poised his long-shadowed spear and hurled it, and smote"
12114,BOOK XXII.,"the midst of the shield of Peleus’ son, and missed him not: but far"
12115,BOOK XXII.,from the shield the spear leapt back. And Hector was wroth that his
12116,BOOK XXII.,"swift weapon had left his hand in vain, and he stood downcast, for he"
12117,BOOK XXII.,had no second ashen spear. And he called with a loud shout to Deiphobos
12118,BOOK XXII.,"of the white shield, and asked of him a long spear, but he was no wise"
12119,BOOK XXII.,"nigh. Then Hector knew he truth in his heart, and spake and said: “Ay"
12120,BOOK XXII.,"me, now verily the gods have summoned me to death. I deemed the warrior"
12121,BOOK XXII.,"Deiphobos was by my side, but he is within the wall, and it was Athene"
12122,BOOK XXII.,"who played me false. Now therefore is evil death come very nigh me, not"
12123,BOOK XXII.,"far off, nor is there way of escape. This then was from of old the"
12124,BOOK XXII.,"pleasure of Zeus and of the far-darting son of Zeus, who yet before"
12125,BOOK XXII.,were fain to succour me: but now my fate hath found me. At least let me
12126,BOOK XXII.,"not die without a struggle or ingloriously, but in some great deed of"
12127,BOOK XXII.,arms whereof men yet to be born shall hear.”
12128,BOOK XXII.,
12129,BOOK XXII.,Thus saying he drew his sharp sword that by his flank hung great and
12130,BOOK XXII.,"strong, and gathered himself and swooped like a soaring eagle that"
12131,BOOK XXII.,darteth to the plain through the dark clouds to seize a tender lamb or
12132,BOOK XXII.,"crouching hare. So Hector swooped, brandishing his sharp sword. And"
12133,BOOK XXII.,"Achilles made at him, for his heart was filled with wild fierceness,"
12134,BOOK XXII.,"and before his breast he made a covering with his fair graven shield,"
12135,BOOK XXII.,and tossed his bright four-plated helm; and round it waved fair golden
12136,BOOK XXII.,plumes [that Hephaistos had set thick about the crest.]. As a star
12137,BOOK XXII.,"goeth among stars in the darkness of night, Hesperos, fairest of all"
12138,BOOK XXII.,"stars set in heaven, so flashed there forth a light from the keen spear"
12139,BOOK XXII.,"Achilles poised in his right hand, devising mischief against noble"
12140,BOOK XXII.,"Hector, eyeing his fair flesh to find the fittest place. Now for the"
12141,BOOK XXII.,rest of him his flesh was covered by the fair bronze armour he stripped
12142,BOOK XXII.,"from strong Patroklos when he slew him, but there was an opening where"
12143,BOOK XXII.,"the collar bones coming from the shoulders clasp the neck, even at the"
12144,BOOK XXII.,"gullet, where destruction of life cometh quickliest; there, as he came"
12145,BOOK XXII.,"on, noble Achilles drave at him with his spear, and right through the"
12146,BOOK XXII.,tender neck went the point. Yet the bronze-weighted ashen spear clave
12147,BOOK XXII.,"not the windpipe, so that he might yet speak words of answer to his"
12148,BOOK XXII.,"foe. And he fell down in the dust, and noble Achilles spake exultingly:"
12149,BOOK XXII.,"“Hector, thou thoughtest, whilst thou wert spoiling Patroklos, that"
12150,BOOK XXII.,"thou wouldst be safe, and didst reck nothing of me who was afar, thou"
12151,BOOK XXII.,"fool. But away among the hollow ships his comrade, a mightier far, even"
12152,BOOK XXII.,"I, was left behind, who now have unstrung thy knees. Thee shall dogs"
12153,BOOK XXII.,"and birds tear foully, but his funeral shall the Achaians make.”"
12154,BOOK XXII.,
12155,BOOK XXII.,Then with faint breath spake unto him Hector of the glancing helm: “I
12156,BOOK XXII.,pray thee by thy life and knees and parents leave me not for dogs of
12157,BOOK XXII.,"the Achaians to devour by the ships, but take good store of bronze and"
12158,BOOK XXII.,"gold, gifts that my father and lady mother shall give to thee, and give"
12159,BOOK XXII.,"them home my body back again, that the Trojans and Trojans’ wives give"
12160,BOOK XXII.,me my due of fire after my death.”
12161,BOOK XXII.,
12162,BOOK XXII.,But unto him with grim gaze spake Achilles fleet of foot: “Entreat me
12163,BOOK XXII.,"not, dog, by knees or parents. Would that my heart’s desire could so"
12164,BOOK XXII.,"bid me myself to carve and eat raw thy flesh, for the evil thou hast"
12165,BOOK XXII.,"wrought me, as surely is there none that shall keep the dogs from thee,"
12166,BOOK XXII.,not even should they bring ten or twenty fold ransom and here weigh it
12167,BOOK XXII.,"out, and promise even more, not even were Priam Dardanos’ son to bid"
12168,BOOK XXII.,"pay thy weight in gold, not even so shall thy lady mother lay thee on a"
12169,BOOK XXII.,"bed to mourn her son, but dogs and birds shall devour thee utterly.”"
12170,BOOK XXII.,
12171,BOOK XXII.,Then dying spake unto him Hector of the glancing helm: “Verily I know
12172,BOOK XXII.,"thee and behold thee as thou art, nor was I destined to persuade thee;"
12173,BOOK XXII.,truly thy heart is iron in thy breast. Take heed now lest I draw upon
12174,BOOK XXII.,"thee wrath of gods, in the day when Paris and Phoebus Apollo slay thee,"
12175,BOOK XXII.,"for all thy valour, at the Skaian gate.”"
12176,BOOK XXII.,
12177,BOOK XXII.,"He ended, and the shadow of death came down upon him, and his soul flew"
12178,BOOK XXII.,"forth of his limbs and was gone to the house of Hades, wailing her"
12179,BOOK XXII.,"fate, leaving her vigour and youth. Then to the dead man spake noble"
12180,BOOK XXII.,"Achilles: “Die: for my death, I will accept it whensoever Zeus and the"
12181,BOOK XXII.,other immortal gods are minded to accomplish it.”
12182,BOOK XXII.,
12183,BOOK XXII.,"He said, and from the corpse drew forth his bronze spear, and set it"
12184,BOOK XXII.,"aside, and stripped the bloody armour from the shoulders. And other"
12185,BOOK XXII.,"sons of Achaians ran up around, who gazed upon the stature and"
12186,BOOK XXII.,"marvellous goodliness of Hector. Nor did any stand by but wounded him,"
12187,BOOK XXII.,"and thus would many a man say looking toward his neighbour: “Go to, of"
12188,BOOK XXII.,a truth far easier to handle is Hector now than when he burnt the ships
12189,BOOK XXII.,"with blazing fire.” Thus would many a man say, and wound him as he"
12190,BOOK XXII.,"stood hard by. And when fleet noble Achilles had despoiled him, he"
12191,BOOK XXII.,"stood up among the Achaians and spake winged words: “Friends, chiefs"
12192,BOOK XXII.,"and counsellors of the Argives, since the gods have vouchsafed us to"
12193,BOOK XXII.,vanquish this man who hath done us more evil than all the rest
12194,BOOK XXII.,"together, come let us make trial in arms round about the city, that we"
12195,BOOK XXII.,"may know somewhat of the Trojans’ purpose, whether since he hath fallen"
12196,BOOK XXII.,"they will forsake the citadel, or whether they are minded to abide,"
12197,BOOK XXII.,albeit Hector is no more. But wherefore doth my heart debate thus?
12198,BOOK XXII.,"There lieth by the ships a dead man unbewailed, unburied, Patroklos;"
12199,BOOK XXII.,"him will I not forget, while I abide among the living and my knees can"
12200,BOOK XXII.,"stir. Nay if even in the house of Hades the dead forget their dead, yet"
12201,BOOK XXII.,"will I even there be mindful of my dear comrade. But come, ye sons of"
12202,BOOK XXII.,"the Achaians, let us now, singing our song of victory, go back to the"
12203,BOOK XXII.,hollow ships and take with us our foe. Great glory have we won; we have
12204,BOOK XXII.,"slain the noble Hector, unto whom the Trojans prayed throughout their"
12205,BOOK XXII.,"city, as he had been a god.”"
12206,BOOK XXII.,
12207,BOOK XXII.,"He said, and devised foul entreatment of noble Hector. The tendons of"
12208,BOOK XXII.,"both feet behind he slit from heel to ankle-joint, and thrust"
12209,BOOK XXII.,"therethrough thongs of ox-hide, and bound him to his chariot, leaving"
12210,BOOK XXII.,his head to trail. And when he had mounted the chariot and lifted
12211,BOOK XXII.,"therein the famous armour, he lashed his horses to speed, and they"
12212,BOOK XXII.,"nothing loth flew on. And dust rose around him that was dragged, and"
12213,BOOK XXII.,"his dark hair flowed loose on either side, and in the dust lay all his"
12214,BOOK XXII.,"once fair head, for now had Zeus given him over to his foes to entreat"
12215,BOOK XXII.,foully in his own native land.
12216,BOOK XXII.,
12217,BOOK XXII.,Thus was his head all grimed with dust. But his mother when she beheld
12218,BOOK XXII.,"her son, tore her hair and cast far from her her shining veil, and"
12219,BOOK XXII.,cried aloud with an exceeding bitter cry. And piteously moaned his
12220,BOOK XXII.,"father, and around them the folk fell to crying and moaning throughout"
12221,BOOK XXII.,the town. Most like it seemed as though all beetling Ilios were burning
12222,BOOK XXII.,utterly in fire. Scarcely could the folk keep back the old man in his
12223,BOOK XXII.,hot desire to get him forth of the Dardanian gates. For he besought
12224,BOOK XXII.,"them all, casting himself down in the mire, and calling on each man by"
12225,BOOK XXII.,"his name: “Hold, friends, and though you love me leave me to get me"
12226,BOOK XXII.,forth of the city alone and go unto the ships of the Achaians. Let me
12227,BOOK XXII.,"pray this accursed horror-working man, if haply he may feel shame"
12228,BOOK XXII.,before his age-fellows and pity an old man. He also hath a father such
12229,BOOK XXII.,"as I am, Peleus, who begat and reared him to be a bane of Trojans—and"
12230,BOOK XXII.,most of all to me hath he brought woe. So many sons of mine hath he
12231,BOOK XXII.,slain in their flower—yet for all my sorrow for the rest I mourn them
12232,BOOK XXII.,"all less than this one alone, for whom my sharp grief will bring me"
12233,BOOK XXII.,down to the house of Hades—even Hector. Would that he had died in my
12234,BOOK XXII.,"arms; then would we have wept and wailed our fill, his mother who bore"
12235,BOOK XXII.,"him to her ill hap, and I myself.”"
12236,BOOK XXII.,
12237,BOOK XXII.,"Thus spake he wailing, and all the men of the city made moan with him."
12238,BOOK XXII.,"And among the women of Troy, Hekabe led the wild lament: “My child, ah,"
12239,BOOK XXII.,"woe is me! wherefore should I live in my pain, now thou art dead, who"
12240,BOOK XXII.,"night and day wert my boast through the city, and blessing to all, both"
12241,BOOK XXII.,"men and women of Troy throughout the town, who hailed thee as a god,"
12242,BOOK XXII.,for verily an exceeding glory to them wert thou in thy life:—now death
12243,BOOK XXII.,and fate have overtaken thee.”
12244,BOOK XXII.,
12245,BOOK XXII.,"Thus spake she wailing. But Hector’s wife knew not as yet, for no true"
12246,BOOK XXII.,"messenger had come to tell her how her husband abode without the gates,"
12247,BOOK XXII.,but in an inner chamber of the lofty house she was weaving a double
12248,BOOK XXII.,"purple web, and broidering therein manifold flowers. Then she called to"
12249,BOOK XXII.,her goodly-haired handmaids through the house to set a great tripod on
12250,BOOK XXII.,"the fire, that Hector might have warm washing when he came home out of"
12251,BOOK XXII.,"the battle fond heart, and was unaware how, far from all washings,"
12252,BOOK XXII.,bright-eyed Athene had slain him by the hand of Achilles. But she heard
12253,BOOK XXII.,"shrieks and groans from the battlements, and her limbs reeled, and the"
12254,BOOK XXII.,shuttle fell from her hands to earth. Then again among her
12255,BOOK XXII.,goodly-haired maids she spake: “Come two of ye this way with me that I
12256,BOOK XXII.,may see what deeds are done. It was the voice of my husband’s noble
12257,BOOK XXII.,"mother that I heard, and in my own breast my heart leapeth to my mouth"
12258,BOOK XXII.,and my knees are numbed beneath me: surely some evil thing is at hand
12259,BOOK XXII.,against the children of Priam. Would that such word might never reach
12260,BOOK XXII.,my ear! yet terribly I dread lest noble Achilles have cut off bold
12261,BOOK XXII.,Hector from the city by himself and chased him to the plain and ere
12262,BOOK XXII.,"this ended his perilous pride that possessed him, for never would he"
12263,BOOK XXII.,"tarry among the throng of men but ran out before them far, yielding"
12264,BOOK XXII.,place to no man in his hardihood.”
12265,BOOK XXII.,
12266,BOOK XXII.,"Thus saying she sped through the chamber like one mad, with beating"
12267,BOOK XXII.,"heart, and with her went her handmaidens. But when she came to the"
12268,BOOK XXII.,"battlements and the throng of men, she stood still upon the wall and"
12269,BOOK XXII.,"gazed, and beheld him dragged before the city:—swift horses dragged him"
12270,BOOK XXII.,recklessly toward the hollow ships of the Achaians. Then dark night
12271,BOOK XXII.,"came on her eyes and shrouded her, and she fell backward and gasped"
12272,BOOK XXII.,forth her spirit. From off her head she shook the bright attiring
12273,BOOK XXII.,"thereof, frontlet and net and woven band, and veil, the veil that"
12274,BOOK XXII.,golden Aphrodite gave her on the day when Hector of the glancing helm
12275,BOOK XXII.,"led her forth of the house of Eetion, having given bride-gifts untold."
12276,BOOK XXII.,"And around her thronged her husband’s sisters and his brothers’ wives,"
12277,BOOK XXII.,"who held her up among them, distraught even to death. But when at last"
12278,BOOK XXII.,"she came to herself and her soul returned into her breast, then wailing"
12279,BOOK XXII.,"with deep sobs she spake among the women of Troy: “O Hector, woe is me!"
12280,BOOK XXII.,"to one fate then were we both born, thou in Troy in the house of Priam,"
12281,BOOK XXII.,"and I in Thebe under woody Plakos, in the house of Eetion, who reared"
12282,BOOK XXII.,"me from a little one—ill-fated sire of cruel-fated child. Ah, would he"
12283,BOOK XXII.,have begotten me not. Now thou to the house of Hades beneath the secret
12284,BOOK XXII.,"places of the earth departest, and me in bitter mourning thou leavest a"
12285,BOOK XXII.,widow in thy halls: and thy son is but an infant child—son of unhappy
12286,BOOK XXII.,"parents, thee and me—nor shalt thou profit him, Hector, since thou art"
12287,BOOK XXII.,"dead, neither he thee. For even if he escape the Achaians’ woful war,"
12288,BOOK XXII.,"yet shall labour and sorrow cleave unto him hereafter, for other men"
12289,BOOK XXII.,shall seize his lands. The day of orphanage sundereth a child from his
12290,BOOK XXII.,"fellows, and his head is bowed down ever, and his cheeks are wet with"
12291,BOOK XXII.,"tears. And in his need the child seeketh his father’s friends, plucking"
12292,BOOK XXII.,"this one by cloak and that by coat, and one of them that pity him"
12293,BOOK XXII.,"holdeth his cup a little to his mouth, and moisteneth his lips, but his"
12294,BOOK XXII.,palate he moisteneth not. And some child unorphaned thrusteth him from
12295,BOOK XXII.,"the feast with blows and taunting words, ‘Out with thee! no father of"
12296,BOOK XXII.,thine is at our board.’ Then weeping to his widowed mother shall he
12297,BOOK XXII.,"return, even Astyanax, who erst upon his father’s knee ate only marrow"
12298,BOOK XXII.,and fat flesh of sheep; and when sleep fell on him and he ceased from
12299,BOOK XXII.,"childish play, then in bed in his nurse’s arms he would slumber softly"
12300,BOOK XXII.,"nested, having satisfied his heart with good things; but now that he"
12301,BOOK XXII.,"hath lost his father he will suffer many ills, Astyanax—that name the"
12302,BOOK XXII.,"Trojans gave him, because thou only wet the defence of their gates and"
12303,BOOK XXII.,"their long walls. But now by the beaked ships, far from thy parents,"
12304,BOOK XXII.,"shall coiling worms devour thee when the dogs have had their fill, as"
12305,BOOK XXII.,"thou liest naked; yet in these halls lieth raiment of thine, delicate"
12306,BOOK XXII.,"and fair, wrought by the hands of women. But verily all these will I"
12307,BOOK XXII.,"consume with burning fire—to thee no profit, since thou wilt never lie"
12308,BOOK XXII.,"therein, yet that his be honour to thee from the men and the women of"
12309,BOOK XXII.,Troy.”
12310,BOOK XXII.,
12311,BOOK XXII.,"Thus spake she wailing, and the women joined their moan."
12312,BOOK XXII.,
12313,BOOK XXII.,
12314,BOOK XXII.,
12315,BOOK XXII.,
12316,BOOK XXIII.,BOOK XXIII.
12317,BOOK XXIII.,
12318,BOOK XXIII.,
12319,BOOK XXIII.,"Of the funeral of Patroklos, and the funeral games."
12320,BOOK XXIII.,
12321,BOOK XXIII.,
12322,BOOK XXIII.,Thus they throughout the city made moan: but the Achaians when they
12323,BOOK XXIII.,were come to the ships and to the Hellespont were scattered each to his
12324,BOOK XXIII.,"own ship: only the Myrmidons Achilles suffered not to be scattered, but"
12325,BOOK XXIII.,spake among his comrades whose delight was in war: “Fleet-horsed
12326,BOOK XXIII.,"Myrmidons, my trusty comrades, let us not yet unyoke our whole-hooved"
12327,BOOK XXIII.,"steeds from their cars, but with horses and chariots let us go near and"
12328,BOOK XXIII.,"mourn Patroklos, for such is the honour of the dead. Then when we have"
12329,BOOK XXIII.,"our fill of grievous wailing, we will unyoke the horses and all sup"
12330,BOOK XXIII.,here.”
12331,BOOK XXIII.,
12332,BOOK XXIII.,"He said, and they with one accord made lamentation, and Achilles led"
12333,BOOK XXIII.,their mourning. So thrice around the dead they drave their well-maned
12334,BOOK XXIII.,"steeds, moaning; and Thetis stirred among them desire of wailing."
12335,BOOK XXIII.,"Bedewed were the sands with tears, bedewed the warriors’ arms; so great"
12336,BOOK XXIII.,"a lord of fear they sorrowed for. And Peleus’ son led their loud wail,"
12337,BOOK XXIII.,"laying his man-slaying hands on his comrade’s breast: “All hail,"
12338,BOOK XXIII.,"Patroklos, even in the house of Hades; for all that I promised thee"
12339,BOOK XXIII.,"before am I accomplishing, seeing I have dragged hither Hector to give"
12340,BOOK XXIII.,"raw unto dogs to devour, and twelve noble children of the Trojans to"
12341,BOOK XXIII.,"slaughter before thy pyre, because of mine anger at thy slaying.”"
12342,BOOK XXIII.,
12343,BOOK XXIII.,"He said, and devised foul entreatment of noble Hector, stretching him"
12344,BOOK XXIII.,prone in the dust beside the bier of Menoitios’ son. And the rest put
12345,BOOK XXIII.,"off each his glittering bronze arms, and unyoked their high-neighing"
12346,BOOK XXIII.,"horses, and sate them down numberless beside the ship of fleet-footed"
12347,BOOK XXIII.,"Aiakides, and he gave them ample funeral feast. Many sleek oxen were"
12348,BOOK XXIII.,"stretched out, their throats cut with steel, and many sheep and"
12349,BOOK XXIII.,"bleating goats, and many white-tusked boars well grown in fat were"
12350,BOOK XXIII.,spitted to singe in the flame of Hephaistos; so on all sides round the
12351,BOOK XXIII.,corpse in cupfuls blood was flowing.
12352,BOOK XXIII.,
12353,BOOK XXIII.,"But the fleet-footed prince, the son of Peleus, was brought to noble"
12354,BOOK XXIII.,"Agamemnon by the Achaian chiefs, hardly persuading him thereto, for his"
12355,BOOK XXIII.,heart was wroth for his comrade. And when they were come to Agamemnon’s
12356,BOOK XXIII.,"hut, forthwith they bade clear-voiced heralds set a great tripod on the"
12357,BOOK XXIII.,"fire, if haply they might persuade the son of Peleus to wash from him"
12358,BOOK XXIII.,"the bloody gore. But he denied them steadfastly, and sware moreover an"
12359,BOOK XXIII.,"oath: “Nay, verily by Zeus, who is highest and best of gods, not lawful"
12360,BOOK XXIII.,is it that water should come nigh my head or ever I shall have laid
12361,BOOK XXIII.,"Patroklos on the fire, and heaped a barrow, and shaved my hair, since"
12362,BOOK XXIII.,"never again shall second grief thus reach my heart, while I remain"
12363,BOOK XXIII.,among the living. Yet now for the present let us yield us to our
12364,BOOK XXIII.,"mournful meal: but with the morning, O king of men Agamemnon, rouse the"
12365,BOOK XXIII.,folk to bring wood and furnish all that it beseemeth a dead man to have
12366,BOOK XXIII.,"when he goeth beneath the misty gloom, to the end that untiring fire"
12367,BOOK XXIII.,"may burn him quickly from sight, and the host betake them to their"
12368,BOOK XXIII.,work.”
12369,BOOK XXIII.,
12370,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus spake he, and they listened readily to him and obeyed, and eagerly"
12371,BOOK XXIII.,"making ready each his meal they supped, and no lack had their soul of"
12372,BOOK XXIII.,equal feast. But when they had put off from them the desire of meat and
12373,BOOK XXIII.,"drink, the rest went down each man to his tent to take his rest, but"
12374,BOOK XXIII.,the son of Peleus upon the beach of the sounding sea lay groaning
12375,BOOK XXIII.,"heavily, amid the host of Myrmidons, in an open place, where waves were"
12376,BOOK XXIII.,"breaking on the shore. Now when sleep took hold on him, easing the"
12377,BOOK XXIII.,"cares of his heart, deep sleep that fell about him, (for sore tired"
12378,BOOK XXIII.,"were his glorious knees with onset upon Hector toward windy Ilios),"
12379,BOOK XXIII.,"then came there unto him the spirit of hapless Patroklos, in all things"
12380,BOOK XXIII.,"like his living self, in stature, and fair eyes, and voice, and the"
12381,BOOK XXIII.,raiment of his body was the same; and he stood above Achilles’ head and
12382,BOOK XXIII.,"spake to him: “Thou sleepest, and hast forgotten me, O Achilles. Not in"
12383,BOOK XXIII.,"my life wast thou ever unmindful of me, but in my death. Bury me with"
12384,BOOK XXIII.,"all speed, that I pass the gates of Hades. Far off the spirits banish"
12385,BOOK XXIII.,"me, the phantoms of men outworn, nor suffer me to mingle with them"
12386,BOOK XXIII.,"beyond the River, but vainly I wander along the wide-gated dwelling of"
12387,BOOK XXIII.,"Hades. Now give me, I pray pitifully of thee, thy hand, for never more"
12388,BOOK XXIII.,"again shall I come back from Hades, when ye have given me my due of"
12389,BOOK XXIII.,fire. Never among the living shall we sit apart from our dear comrades
12390,BOOK XXIII.,"and take counsel together, but me hath the harsh fate swallowed up"
12391,BOOK XXIII.,"which was appointed me even from my birth. Yea and thou too thyself,"
12392,BOOK XXIII.,"Achilles peer of gods, beneath the wall of the noble Trojans art doomed"
12393,BOOK XXIII.,"to die. Yet one thing will I say, and charge thee, if haply thou wilt"
12394,BOOK XXIII.,"have regard thereto. Lay not my bones apart from thine, Achilles, but"
12395,BOOK XXIII.,"together, even as we were nurtured in your house, when Menoitios"
12396,BOOK XXIII.,brought me yet a little one from Opoeis to your country by reason of a
12397,BOOK XXIII.,"grievous man-slaying, on the day when I slew Amphidamas’ son, not"
12398,BOOK XXIII.,"willing it, in childish wrath over the dice. Then took me the knight"
12399,BOOK XXIII.,Peleus into his house and reared me kindly and named me thy squire: so
12400,BOOK XXIII.,"therefore let one coffer hide our bones [a golden coffer, two handled,"
12401,BOOK XXIII.,thy lady mother’s gift].”
12402,BOOK XXIII.,
12403,BOOK XXIII.,"Then made answer unto him Achilles fleet of foot: “Wherefore, O my"
12404,BOOK XXIII.,"brother, hast thou come hither, and chargest me everything that I"
12405,BOOK XXIII.,"should do? Verily I will accomplish all, and have regard unto thy"
12406,BOOK XXIII.,bidding. But stand more nigh me; for one moment let us throw our arms
12407,BOOK XXIII.,"around each other, and take our fill of dolorous lament.”"
12408,BOOK XXIII.,
12409,BOOK XXIII.,"He spake, and reached forth with his hands, but clasped him not; for"
12410,BOOK XXIII.,like a vapour the spirit was gone beneath the earth with a faint
12411,BOOK XXIII.,"shriek. And Achilles sprang up marvelling, and smote his hands"
12412,BOOK XXIII.,"together, and spake a word of woe: “Ay me, there remaineth then even in"
12413,BOOK XXIII.,"the house of Hades a spirit and phantom of the dead, albeit the life be"
12414,BOOK XXIII.,not anywise therein: for all night long hath the spirit of hapless
12415,BOOK XXIII.,"Patroklos stood over me, wailing and making moan, and charged me"
12416,BOOK XXIII.,"everything that I should do, and wondrous like his living self it"
12417,BOOK XXIII.,seemed.”
12418,BOOK XXIII.,
12419,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus said he, and stirred in all of them yearning to make lament; and"
12420,BOOK XXIII.,rosy-fingered Morn shone forth on them while they still made moan
12421,BOOK XXIII.,around the piteous corpse. Then lord Agamemnon sped mules and men from
12422,BOOK XXIII.,"all the huts to fetch wood; and a man of valour watched thereover, even"
12423,BOOK XXIII.,"Meriones, squire of kindly Idomeneus. And they went forth with"
12424,BOOK XXIII.,"wood-cutting axes in their hands and well-woven ropes, and before them"
12425,BOOK XXIII.,"went the mules, and uphill and downhill and sideways and across they"
12426,BOOK XXIII.,"went. But when they came to the spurs of many-fountained Ida,"
12427,BOOK XXIII.,straightway they set them lustily to hew high-foliaged oaks with the
12428,BOOK XXIII.,"long-edged bronze, and with loud noise fell the trees. Then splitting"
12429,BOOK XXIII.,"them asunder the Achaians bound them behind the mules, and they tore up"
12430,BOOK XXIII.,the earth with their feet as they made for the plain through the thick
12431,BOOK XXIII.,"underwood. And all the wood-cutters bare logs; for thus bade Meriones,"
12432,BOOK XXIII.,squire of kindly Idomeneus. And on the Shore they threw them down in
12433,BOOK XXIII.,"line, where Achilles purposed a mighty tomb for Patroklos and for"
12434,BOOK XXIII.,himself.
12435,BOOK XXIII.,
12436,BOOK XXIII.,"Then when they had laid down all about great piles of wood, they sate"
12437,BOOK XXIII.,them down all together and abode. Then straightway Achilles bade the
12438,BOOK XXIII.,warlike Myrmidons gird on their arms and each yoke the horses to his
12439,BOOK XXIII.,"chariot; and they arose and put their armour on, and mounted their"
12440,BOOK XXIII.,"chariots, both fighting men and charioteers. In front were the men in"
12441,BOOK XXIII.,"chariots, and a cloud of footmen followed after, numberless; and in the"
12442,BOOK XXIII.,midst his comrades bare Patroklos. And they heaped all the corpse with
12443,BOOK XXIII.,their hair that they cut off and threw thereon; and behind did goodly
12444,BOOK XXIII.,"Achilles bear the head, sorrowing; for a noble comrade was he speeding"
12445,BOOK XXIII.,forth unto the realm of Hades.
12446,BOOK XXIII.,
12447,BOOK XXIII.,"And when they came to the place where Achilles had bidden them, they"
12448,BOOK XXIII.,"set down the dead, and piled for him abundant wood. Then fleet-footed"
12449,BOOK XXIII.,noble Achilles bethought him of one thing more: standing apart from the
12450,BOOK XXIII.,"pyre he shore off a golden lock, the lock whose growth he nursed to"
12451,BOOK XXIII.,"offer unto the River Spercheios, and sore troubled spake be, looking"
12452,BOOK XXIII.,"forth over the wine-dark sea: “Spercheios, in other wise vowed my"
12453,BOOK XXIII.,father Peleus unto thee that I returning thither to my native land
12454,BOOK XXIII.,"should shear my hair for thee and offer a holy hecatomb, and fifty rams"
12455,BOOK XXIII.,"should sacrifice there above thy springs, where is the sacred close and"
12456,BOOK XXIII.,"altar burning spice. So vowed the old man, but thou hast not"
12457,BOOK XXIII.,accomplished him his desire. And now since I return not to my dear
12458,BOOK XXIII.,"native land, unto the hero Patroklos I may give this hair to take"
12459,BOOK XXIII.,away.”
12460,BOOK XXIII.,
12461,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus saying he set the hair in the hands of his dear comrade, and"
12462,BOOK XXIII.,stirred in all of them yearning to make lament. And so would the light
12463,BOOK XXIII.,"of the sun have gone down on their lamentation, had not Achilles said"
12464,BOOK XXIII.,quickly to Agamemnon as he stood beside him: “Son of Atreus—for to thy
12465,BOOK XXIII.,words most will the host of the Achaians have regard—of lamentation
12466,BOOK XXIII.,they may sate them to the full. But now disperse them from the burning
12467,BOOK XXIII.,"and bid them make ready their meal, and we to whom the dead is dearest"
12468,BOOK XXIII.,will take pains for these things; yet let the chiefs tarry nigh unto
12469,BOOK XXIII.,us.”
12470,BOOK XXIII.,
12471,BOOK XXIII.,"Then when Agamemnon king of men heard that, he forthwith dispersed the"
12472,BOOK XXIII.,"host among the trim ships, but the nearest to the dead tarried there"
12473,BOOK XXIII.,"and piled the wood, and made a pyre a hundred feet this way and that,"
12474,BOOK XXIII.,"and on the pyre’s top set the corpse, with anguish at their hearts. And"
12475,BOOK XXIII.,many lusty sheep and shambling crook-horned oxen they flayed and made
12476,BOOK XXIII.,"ready before the pyre; and taking from all of them the fat, great"
12477,BOOK XXIII.,"hearted Achilles wrapped the corpse therein from head to foot, and"
12478,BOOK XXIII.,heaped the flayed bodies round. And he set therein two-handled jars of
12479,BOOK XXIII.,"honey and oil, leaning them against the bier; and four strong-necked"
12480,BOOK XXIII.,"horses he threw swiftly on the pyre, and groaned aloud. Nine house-dogs"
12481,BOOK XXIII.,had the dead chief: of them did Achilles slay twain and throw them on
12482,BOOK XXIII.,the pyre. And twelve valiant sons of great-hearted Trojans he slew with
12483,BOOK XXIII.,the sword—for he devised mischief in his heart and he set to the
12484,BOOK XXIII.,"merciless might of the fire, to feed thereon. Then moaned he aloud, and"
12485,BOOK XXIII.,"called on his dear comrade by his name: “All hail to thee, O Patroklos,"
12486,BOOK XXIII.,"even in the house of Hades, for all that I promised thee before am I"
12487,BOOK XXIII.,"now accomplishing. Twelve valiant sons of great-hearted Trojans, behold"
12488,BOOK XXIII.,these all in company with thee the fire devoureth: but Hector son of
12489,BOOK XXIII.,"Priam will I nowise give to the fire to feed upon, but to dogs.”"
12490,BOOK XXIII.,
12491,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus spake he threatening, but no dogs might deal with Hector, for day"
12492,BOOK XXIII.,"and night Aphrodite daughter of Zeus kept off the dogs, and anointed"
12493,BOOK XXIII.,him with rose-sweet oil ambrosial that Achilles might not tear him when
12494,BOOK XXIII.,he dragged him. And over him Phoebus Apollo brought a dark cloud from
12495,BOOK XXIII.,"heaven to earth and covered all that place whereon the dead man lay,"
12496,BOOK XXIII.,lest meanwhile the sun’s strength shrivel his flesh round about upon
12497,BOOK XXIII.,his sinews and limbs.
12498,BOOK XXIII.,
12499,BOOK XXIII.,But the pyre of dead Patroklos kindled not. Then fleet-footed noble
12500,BOOK XXIII.,Achilles had a further thought: standing aside from the pyre he prayed
12501,BOOK XXIII.,"to the two Winds of North and West, and promised them fair offerings,"
12502,BOOK XXIII.,"and pouring large libations from a golden cup besought them to come,"
12503,BOOK XXIII.,"that the corpses might blaze up speedily in the fire, and the wood make"
12504,BOOK XXIII.,"haste to be enkindled. Then Iris, when she heard his prayer, went"
12505,BOOK XXIII.,swiftly with the message to the Winds. They within the house of the
12506,BOOK XXIII.,"gusty West Wind were feasting all together at meat, when Iris sped"
12507,BOOK XXIII.,"thither, and halted on the threshold of stone. And when they saw her"
12508,BOOK XXIII.,"with their eyes, they sprang up and called to her every one to sit by"
12509,BOOK XXIII.,"him. But she refused to sit, and spake her word: “No seat for me; I"
12510,BOOK XXIII.,"must go back to the streams of Ocean, to the Ethiopians’ land where"
12511,BOOK XXIII.,"they sacrifice hecatombs to the immortal gods, that I too may feast at"
12512,BOOK XXIII.,their rites. But Achilles is praying the North Wind and the loud West
12513,BOOK XXIII.,"to come, and promising them fair offerings, that ye may make the pyre"
12514,BOOK XXIII.,"be kindled whereon lieth Patroklos, for whom all the Achaians are"
12515,BOOK XXIII.,making moan.”
12516,BOOK XXIII.,
12517,BOOK XXIII.,"She having thus said departed, and they arose with a mighty sound,"
12518,BOOK XXIII.,rolling the clouds before them. And swiftly they came blowing over the
12519,BOOK XXIII.,"sea, and the wave rose beneath their shrill blast; and they came to"
12520,BOOK XXIII.,"deep-soiled Troy, and fell upon the pile, and loudly roared the mighty"
12521,BOOK XXIII.,"fire. So all night drave they the flame of the pyre together, blowing"
12522,BOOK XXIII.,"shrill; and all night fleet Achilles, holding a two-handled cup, drew"
12523,BOOK XXIII.,"wine from a golden bowl, and poured it forth and drenched the earth,"
12524,BOOK XXIII.,calling upon the spirit of hapless Patroklos. As a father waileth when
12525,BOOK XXIII.,"he burneth the bones of his son, new-married, whose death is woe to his"
12526,BOOK XXIII.,"hapless parents, so wailed Achilles as he burnt the bones of his"
12527,BOOK XXIII.,"comrade, going heavily round the burning pile, with many moans."
12528,BOOK XXIII.,
12529,BOOK XXIII.,But at the hour when the Morning star goeth forth to herald light upon
12530,BOOK XXIII.,"the earth, the star that saffron-mantled Dawn cometh after, and"
12531,BOOK XXIII.,"spreadeth over the salt sea, then grew the burning faint, and the flame"
12532,BOOK XXIII.,died down. And the Winds went back again to betake them home over the
12533,BOOK XXIII.,"Thracian main, and it roared with a violent swell. Then the son of"
12534,BOOK XXIII.,"Peleus turned away from the burning and lay down wearied, and sweet"
12535,BOOK XXIII.,sleep leapt on him. But they who were with Atreus’ son gathered all
12536,BOOK XXIII.,"together, and the noise and clash of their approach aroused him; and he"
12537,BOOK XXIII.,sate upright and spake a word to them: “Son of Atreus and ye other
12538,BOOK XXIII.,"chiefs of the Achaians, first quench with gleaming wine all the burning"
12539,BOOK XXIII.,"so far as the fire’s strength hath reached, and then let us gather up"
12540,BOOK XXIII.,"the bones of Patroklos, Menoitios’ son, singling them well, and easy"
12541,BOOK XXIII.,"are they to discern, for he lay in the middle of the pyre, while the"
12542,BOOK XXIII.,"rest apart at the edge burnt-confusedly, horses and men. And his bones"
12543,BOOK XXIII.,"let us put within a golden urn, and double-folded fat, until that I"
12544,BOOK XXIII.,myself be hidden in Hades. But no huge barrow I bid you toil to raise—a
12545,BOOK XXIII.,"seemly one, no more: then afterward do ye Achaians build it broad and"
12546,BOOK XXIII.,"high, whosoever of you after I am gone may be left in the benched"
12547,BOOK XXIII.,ships.”
12548,BOOK XXIII.,
12549,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus spake he, and they hearkened to the fleet-footed son of Peleus."
12550,BOOK XXIII.,First quenched they with gleaming wine the burning so far as the flame
12551,BOOK XXIII.,"went, and the ash had settled deep: then with lamentation they gathered"
12552,BOOK XXIII.,up the white bones of their gentle comrade into a golden urn and
12553,BOOK XXIII.,"double-folded fat, and placed the urn in the hut and covered it with a"
12554,BOOK XXIII.,"linen veil. And they marked the circle of the barrow, and set the"
12555,BOOK XXIII.,"foundations thereof around the pyre, and straightway heaped thereon a"
12556,BOOK XXIII.,heap of earth. Then when they had heaped up the barrow they were for
12557,BOOK XXIII.,"going back. But Achilles stayed the folk in that place, and made them"
12558,BOOK XXIII.,"sit in wide assembly, and from his ships he brought forth prizes,"
12559,BOOK XXIII.,"caldrons and tripods, and horses and mules and strong oxen, and"
12560,BOOK XXIII.,"fair-girdled women, and grey iron."
12561,BOOK XXIII.,
12562,BOOK XXIII.,"First for fleet chariot-racers he ordained a noble prize, a woman"
12563,BOOK XXIII.,"skilled in fair handiwork for the winner to lead home, and an eared"
12564,BOOK XXIII.,tripod that held two-and-twenty measures; these for the first man; and
12565,BOOK XXIII.,for the second he ordained a six-year-old mare unbroke with a mule foal
12566,BOOK XXIII.,in her womb; and for the third he gave a goodly caldron yet untouched
12567,BOOK XXIII.,"by fire, holding four measures, bright as when first made; and for the"
12568,BOOK XXIII.,fourth he ordained two talents of gold; and for the fifth a two-handled
12569,BOOK XXIII.,"urn untouched of fire, Then he stood up and spake a word among the"
12570,BOOK XXIII.,"Argives: “Son of Atreus and ye other well-greaved Achaians, for the"
12571,BOOK XXIII.,chariot-racers these prizes lie awaiting them in the lists. If in some
12572,BOOK XXIII.,"other’s honour we Achaians were now holding our games, it would be I"
12573,BOOK XXIII.,who should win the first prize and bear it to my hut; for ye know how
12574,BOOK XXIII.,"far my pair of horses are first in excellence, for they are immortal"
12575,BOOK XXIII.,"and Poseidon gave them to my father Peleus, and he again to me. But"
12576,BOOK XXIII.,"verily I will abide, I and my whole-hooved horses, so glorious a"
12577,BOOK XXIII.,"charioteer have they lost, and one so kind, who on their manes full"
12578,BOOK XXIII.,"often poured smooth oil, when he had washed them in clear water. For"
12579,BOOK XXIII.,"him they stand and mourn, and their manes are trailing on the ground,"
12580,BOOK XXIII.,and there stand they with sorrow at their hearts. But ye others
12581,BOOK XXIII.,"throughout the host get ye to your places, whosoever of the Achalans"
12582,BOOK XXIII.,hath trust in his horses and firm-jointed car.”
12583,BOOK XXIII.,
12584,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus spake the son of Peleus, and the fleet chariot-racers were"
12585,BOOK XXIII.,"gathered. First of all arose up Eumelos king of men, Admetos’ son, a"
12586,BOOK XXIII.,"skilful charioteer; and next to him arose Tydeus’ son, valiant"
12587,BOOK XXIII.,"Diomedes, and yoked his horses of the breed of Tros, which on a time he"
12588,BOOK XXIII.,"seized from Aineias, when Apollo saved their lord. And after him arose"
12589,BOOK XXIII.,"Atreus’ son, fair-haired heaven-sprung Menelaos, and yoked him a swift"
12590,BOOK XXIII.,"pair Aithe, Agamemnon’s mare, and his own horse Podargos. Her unto"
12591,BOOK XXIII.,"Agamemnon did Anchises’ son Echepolos give in fee, that he might escape"
12592,BOOK XXIII.,from following him to windy Ilios and take his pleasure at home; for
12593,BOOK XXIII.,"great wealth had Zeus given him, and he dwelt in Sikyon of spacious"
12594,BOOK XXIII.,"lawns:— so Menelaos yoked her, and she longed exceedingly for the race."
12595,BOOK XXIII.,"And fourth, Antilochos made ready his fair-maned horses, even the noble"
12596,BOOK XXIII.,"son of Nestor, high-hearted king, who was the son of Neleus; and fleet"
12597,BOOK XXIII.,horses bred at Pylos drew his car. And his father standing by his side
12598,BOOK XXIII.,"spake counselling him to his profit, though himself was well advised:"
12599,BOOK XXIII.,"“Antilochos, verily albeit thou art young, Zeus and Poseidon have loved"
12600,BOOK XXIII.,thee and taught thee all skill with horses; wherefore to teach thee is
12601,BOOK XXIII.,"no great need, for thou well knowest how to wheel round the post; yet"
12602,BOOK XXIII.,are thy horses very slow in the race: therefore methinks there will be
12603,BOOK XXIII.,"sad work for thee. For the horses of the others are fleeter, yet the"
12604,BOOK XXIII.,"men know not more cunning than thou hast. So come, dear son, store thy"
12605,BOOK XXIII.,"mind with all manner of cunning, that the prize escape thee not. By"
12606,BOOK XXIII.,cunning is a woodman far better than by force; by cunning doth a
12607,BOOK XXIII.,helmsman on the wine-dark deep steer his swift ship buffeted by winds;
12608,BOOK XXIII.,by cunning hath charioteer the better of charioteer. For whoso trusting
12609,BOOK XXIII.,"in his horses and car alone wheeleth heedlessly and wide at either end,"
12610,BOOK XXIII.,"his horses swerve on the course, and he keepeth them not in hand. But"
12611,BOOK XXIII.,"whoso is of crafty mind, though he drive worse horses, he ever keeping"
12612,BOOK XXIII.,"his eye upon the post turneth closely by it, neither is unaware how far"
12613,BOOK XXIII.,"at first to force his horses by the ox-hide reins, but holdeth them"
12614,BOOK XXIII.,safe in hand and watcheth the leader in the race. Now will I tell thee
12615,BOOK XXIII.,"a certain sign, and it shall not escape thee. A fathom’s height above"
12616,BOOK XXIII.,"the ground standeth a withered stump, whether of oak or pine: it"
12617,BOOK XXIII.,"decayeth not in the rain, and two white stones on either side thereof"
12618,BOOK XXIII.,"are fixed at the joining of the track, and all round it is smooth"
12619,BOOK XXIII.,"driving ground. Whether it be a monument of some man dead long ago, or"
12620,BOOK XXIII.,"have been made their goal in the race by ancient men, this now is the"
12621,BOOK XXIII.,mark fixed by fleet-footed Achilles. Wherefore do thou drive close and
12622,BOOK XXIII.,"bear thy horses and chariot hard thereon, and lean thy body on the"
12623,BOOK XXIII.,"well-knit car slightly to their left, and call upon the off-horse with"
12624,BOOK XXIII.,"voice and lash, and give him rein from thy hand. But let the near horse"
12625,BOOK XXIII.,hug the post so that the nave of the well-wrought wheel seem to graze
12626,BOOK XXIII.,"it—yet beware of touching the stone, lest thou wound the horses and"
12627,BOOK XXIII.,break the chariot; so would that be triumph to the rest and reproach
12628,BOOK XXIII.,"unto thyself. But, dear son, be wise and on thy guard; for if at the"
12629,BOOK XXIII.,"turning-post thou drive past the rest, there is none shall overtake"
12630,BOOK XXIII.,"thee from behind or pass thee by, not though he drave the goodly Arion"
12631,BOOK XXIII.,"in pursuit, the fleet horse of Adrastos, of divine descent, or the"
12632,BOOK XXIII.,"horses of Laomedon, best of all bred in this land.”"
12633,BOOK XXIII.,
12634,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus spake Neleian Nestor and sate him down again in his place, when he"
12635,BOOK XXIII.,had told his son the sum of every matter.
12636,BOOK XXIII.,
12637,BOOK XXIII.,And Meriones was the fifth to make ready his sleek-coated steeds. Then
12638,BOOK XXIII.,"went they up into their chariots, and cast in the lots: and Achilles"
12639,BOOK XXIII.,"shook them, and forth leapt the lot of Antilochos Nestor’s son, and the"
12640,BOOK XXIII.,"next lot had lord Eumelos, and next to him the son of Atreus,"
12641,BOOK XXIII.,"spear-famed Menelaos, and next to him drew Meriones his place; then"
12642,BOOK XXIII.,"lastly Tydeides, far the best of all, drew his lot for his chariot’s"
12643,BOOK XXIII.,"place. Then they stood side by side, and Achilles showed to them the"
12644,BOOK XXIII.,"turning post, far off in the smooth plain; and beside it he placed an"
12645,BOOK XXIII.,"umpire, godlike Phoinix, his father’s follower, that he might note the"
12646,BOOK XXIII.,running and tell the truth thereof.
12647,BOOK XXIII.,
12648,BOOK XXIII.,"Then all together lifted the lash above their steeds, and smote them"
12649,BOOK XXIII.,"with the reins, and called on them eagerly with words: and they"
12650,BOOK XXIII.,"forthwith sped swiftly over the plain, leaving the ships behind; and"
12651,BOOK XXIII.,"beneath their breasts stood the rising dust like a cloud or whirlwind,"
12652,BOOK XXIII.,and their manes waved on the blowing wind. And the chariots ran
12653,BOOK XXIII.,"sometimes on the bounteous earth, and other whiles would bound into the"
12654,BOOK XXIII.,"air. And the drivers stood in the cars, and the heart of every man beat"
12655,BOOK XXIII.,"in desire of victory, and they called every man to his horses, that"
12656,BOOK XXIII.,flew amid their dust across the plain.
12657,BOOK XXIII.,
12658,BOOK XXIII.,"But when the fleet horses were now running the last part of the course,"
12659,BOOK XXIII.,"back toward the grey sea, then was manifest the prowess of each, and"
12660,BOOK XXIII.,the horses strained in the race; and presently to the front rushed the
12661,BOOK XXIII.,"fleet mares of Pheres’ grandson, and next to them Diomedes’ stallions"
12662,BOOK XXIII.,"of the breed of Tros, not far apart, but hard anigh, for they seemed"
12663,BOOK XXIII.,"ever as they would mount Eumelos’ car, and with their breath his back"
12664,BOOK XXIII.,"was warm and his broad shoulders, for they bent their heads upon him as"
12665,BOOK XXIII.,they flew along. Thus would Tydeus’ son have either outstripped the
12666,BOOK XXIII.,"other or made it a dead heat, had not Phoebus Apollo been wroth with"
12667,BOOK XXIII.,him and smitten from his hand the shining lash. Then from his eyes ran
12668,BOOK XXIII.,"tears of anger, for that he saw the mares still at speed, even"
12669,BOOK XXIII.,"swiftlier than before, while his own horses were thrown out, as running"
12670,BOOK XXIII.,without spur. But Athene was not unaware of Apollo’s guile against
12671,BOOK XXIII.,"Tydeides, and presently sped after the shepherd of hosts, and gave him"
12672,BOOK XXIII.,"back the lash, and put spirit into his steeds. Then in wrath after the"
12673,BOOK XXIII.,"son of Admetos was the goddess gone, and brake his steeds’ yoke, and"
12674,BOOK XXIII.,"the mares ran sideways off the course, and the pole was twisted to the"
12675,BOOK XXIII.,"ground. And Eumelos was hurled out of the car beside the wheel, and his"
12676,BOOK XXIII.,"elbows and mouth and nose were flayed, and his forehead bruised above"
12677,BOOK XXIII.,his eyebrows; and his eyes filled with tears and his lusty voice was
12678,BOOK XXIII.,"choked. Then Tydeides held his whole-hooved horses on one side, darting"
12679,BOOK XXIII.,"far out before the rest, for Athene put spirit into his steeds and shed"
12680,BOOK XXIII.,glory on himself. Now next after him came golden-haired Menelaos
12681,BOOK XXIII.,Atreus’ son. But Antilochos called to his father’s horses: “Go ye too
12682,BOOK XXIII.,"in, strain to your fleetest pace. Truly I nowise bid you strive with"
12683,BOOK XXIII.,"those, the horses of wise Tydeides, unto which Athene hath now given"
12684,BOOK XXIII.,"speed, and shed glory on their charioteer. But overtake Atreides’"
12685,BOOK XXIII.,"horses with all haste, and be not outstripped by them, lest Aithe that"
12686,BOOK XXIII.,"is but a mare pour scorn on you. Why are ye outstripped, brave steeds?"
12687,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus will I tell you, and verily it shall be brought to pass—ye will"
12688,BOOK XXIII.,"find no tendance with Nestor shepherd of hosts, but straightway he will"
12689,BOOK XXIII.,slay you with the edge of the sword if through heedlessness we win but
12690,BOOK XXIII.,"the worse prize. Have after them at your utmost speed, and I for my"
12691,BOOK XXIII.,"part will devise a plan to pass them in the strait part of the course,"
12692,BOOK XXIII.,and this shall fail me not.”
12693,BOOK XXIII.,
12694,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus spake he, and they fearing the voice of the prince ran swiftlier"
12695,BOOK XXIII.,some little while; and presently did the good warrior Antilochos espy a
12696,BOOK XXIII.,"strait place in a sunk part of the way. There was a rift in the earth,"
12697,BOOK XXIII.,"where torrent water gathered and brake part of the track away, and"
12698,BOOK XXIII.,"hollowed all the place; there drave Menelaos, shunning the encounter of"
12699,BOOK XXIII.,the wheels. But Antilochos turned his whole-hooved horses out of the
12700,BOOK XXIII.,"track, and followed him a little at one side. And the son of Atreus"
12701,BOOK XXIII.,"took alarm and shouted to Antilochos: “Antilochos, thou art driving"
12702,BOOK XXIII.,"recklessly—hold in thy horses! The road is straitened, soon thou mayest"
12703,BOOK XXIII.,"pass me in a wider place, lest thou foul my chariot and undo us both.”"
12704,BOOK XXIII.,
12705,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus spake he, but Antilochos drave even fiercelier than before, plying"
12706,BOOK XXIII.,"his lash, as though he heard him not. As far as is the range of a disk"
12707,BOOK XXIII.,"swung from the shoulder when a young man hurleth it, making trial of"
12708,BOOK XXIII.,"his force, even so far ran they on; then the mares of Atreus’ son gave"
12709,BOOK XXIII.,"back, for he ceased of himself to urge them on, lest the whole-hooved"
12710,BOOK XXIII.,"steeds should encounter on the track, and overset the well-knit cars,"
12711,BOOK XXIII.,and the drivers fall in the dust in their zeal for victory. So
12712,BOOK XXIII.,"upbraiding Antilochos spake golden-haired Menelaos: “Antilochos, no"
12713,BOOK XXIII.,"mortal man is more malicious than thou. Go thy mad way, since falsely"
12714,BOOK XXIII.,have we Achaians called thee wise. Yet even so thou shalt not bear off
12715,BOOK XXIII.,the prize unchallenged to an oath.”
12716,BOOK XXIII.,
12717,BOOK XXIII.,Thus saying he called aloud to his horses: “Hold ye not back nor stand
12718,BOOK XXIII.,still with sorrow at heart. Their feet and knees will grow weary before
12719,BOOK XXIII.,"yours, for they both lack youth.”"
12720,BOOK XXIII.,
12721,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus spake he, and they fearing the voice of the prince sped faster on,"
12722,BOOK XXIII.,and were quickly close upon the others.
12723,BOOK XXIII.,
12724,BOOK XXIII.,"Now the Argives sitting in concourse were gazing at the horses, and"
12725,BOOK XXIII.,they came flying amid their dust over the plain. And the first aware of
12726,BOOK XXIII.,"them was Idomeneus, chief of the Cretans, for he was sitting outside"
12727,BOOK XXIII.,"the concourse in the highest place of view, and when he heard the voice"
12728,BOOK XXIII.,"of one that shouted, though afar off, he knew it; and he was aware of a"
12729,BOOK XXIII.,"horse showing plainly in the front, a chestnut all the rest of him, but"
12730,BOOK XXIII.,in the forehead marked with a white star round like the moon. And he
12731,BOOK XXIII.,"stood upright and spoke among the Argives: “Friends, chiefs, and"
12732,BOOK XXIII.,"counsellors of the Argives, is it I alone who see the horses, or do ye"
12733,BOOK XXIII.,"also? A new pair seem to me now to be in front, and a new charioteer"
12734,BOOK XXIII.,appeareth; the mares which led in the outward course must have been
12735,BOOK XXIII.,thrown out there in the plain. For I saw them turning first the hither
12736,BOOK XXIII.,"post, but now can see them nowhere, though my eyes are gazing"
12737,BOOK XXIII.,everywhere along the Trojan plain. Did the reins escape the charioteer
12738,BOOK XXIII.,so that he could not drive aright round the post and failed in the
12739,BOOK XXIII.,"turn? There, methinks, must he have been cast forth, and have broken"
12740,BOOK XXIII.,"his chariot, and the mares must have left the course, in the wildness"
12741,BOOK XXIII.,"of their heart. But stand up ye too and look, for myself I discern not"
12742,BOOK XXIII.,"certainly, but the first man seemeth to me one of Aitolian race, and he"
12743,BOOK XXIII.,"ruleth among Argives, the son of horse-taming Tydeus, stalwart"
12744,BOOK XXIII.,Diomedes.”
12745,BOOK XXIII.,
12746,BOOK XXIII.,"Then fleet Aias Oileus’ son rebuked him in unseemly sort: “Idomeneus,"
12747,BOOK XXIII.,why art thou a braggart of old? As yet far off the high-stepping mares
12748,BOOK XXIII.,are coursing over the wide plain. Neither art thou so far the youngest
12749,BOOK XXIII.,"among the Argives, nor do thy eyes look so far the keenliest from thy"
12750,BOOK XXIII.,"head, yet continually braggest thou. It beseemeth thee not to be a"
12751,BOOK XXIII.,"braggart, for there are here better men. And the mares leading are they"
12752,BOOK XXIII.,"that led before, Eumelos’ mares, and he standeth and holdeth the reins"
12753,BOOK XXIII.,within the car.”
12754,BOOK XXIII.,
12755,BOOK XXIII.,"Then wrathfully in answer spake the chief of Cretans: “Aias, master of"
12756,BOOK XXIII.,"railing, ill-counselled, in all else art thou behind other Argives, for"
12757,BOOK XXIII.,"thy mind is unfriendly. Come then let us wager a tripod or caldron, and"
12758,BOOK XXIII.,"make Agamemnon Atreus’ son our umpire, which mares are leading, that"
12759,BOOK XXIII.,thou mayest pay and learn.”
12760,BOOK XXIII.,
12761,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus said he, and straightway fleet Aias Oileus’ son arose angrily to"
12762,BOOK XXIII.,answer with harsh words: and strife between the twain would have gone
12763,BOOK XXIII.,"further, had not Achilles himself stood up and spake a word: “No longer"
12764,BOOK XXIII.,"answer each other with harsh words, Aias and Idomeneus, ill words, for"
12765,BOOK XXIII.,it beseemeth not. Surely ye are displeased with any other who should do
12766,BOOK XXIII.,thus. Sit ye in the concourse and keep your eyes upon the horses; soon
12767,BOOK XXIII.,"they in zeal for victory will come hither, and then shall ye know each"
12768,BOOK XXIII.,"of you the Argives’ horses, which follow, and which lead.”"
12769,BOOK XXIII.,
12770,BOOK XXIII.,"He said, and the son of Tydeus came driving up, and with his lash smote"
12771,BOOK XXIII.,"now and again from the shoulder, and his horses were stepping high as"
12772,BOOK XXIII.,they sped swiftly on their way. And sprinklings of dust smote ever the
12773,BOOK XXIII.,"charioteer, and his chariot overlaid with gold and tin ran behind his"
12774,BOOK XXIII.,"fleet-footed steeds, and small trace was there of the wheel-tires"
12775,BOOK XXIII.,"behind in the fine dust, as they flew speeding on. Then he drew up in"
12776,BOOK XXIII.,"the mid concourse, and much sweat poured from the horses’ heads and"
12777,BOOK XXIII.,"chests to the ground. And Diomedes leapt to earth from the shining car,"
12778,BOOK XXIII.,and leant his lash against the yoke. Then stalwart Sthenelos tarried
12779,BOOK XXIII.,"not, but promptly took the prize, and gave to his proud comrades the"
12780,BOOK XXIII.,"woman to lead and the eared tripod to bear away, and he loosed the"
12781,BOOK XXIII.,horses from the yoke.
12782,BOOK XXIII.,
12783,BOOK XXIII.,"And next after him drave Neleian Antilochos his horses, by craft, not"
12784,BOOK XXIII.,"swiftness, having passed by Menelaos; yet even now Menelaos held his"
12785,BOOK XXIII.,"swift steeds hard anigh. As far as a horse is from the wheel, which"
12786,BOOK XXIII.,"draweth his master, straining with the car over the plain—his hindmost"
12787,BOOK XXIII.,"tail-hairs touch the tire, for the wheel runneth hard anigh nor is much"
12788,BOOK XXIII.,"space between, as he speedeth far over the plain—by so much was"
12789,BOOK XXIII.,"Menelaos behind high-born Antilochos, howbeit at first he was a whole"
12790,BOOK XXIII.,"disk-cast behind, but quickly he was catching Antilochos up, for the"
12791,BOOK XXIII.,"high mettle of Agamemnon’s mare, sleek-coated Aithe, was rising in her."
12792,BOOK XXIII.,And if yet further both had had to run he would have passed his rival
12793,BOOK XXIII.,"nor left it even a dead heat. But Meriones, stout squire of Idomeneus,"
12794,BOOK XXIII.,"came in a spear-throw behind famous Menelaos, for tardiest of all were"
12795,BOOK XXIII.,"his sleek-coated horses, and slowest he himself to drive a chariot in"
12796,BOOK XXIII.,"the race. Last of them all came Admetos’ son, dragging his goodly car"
12797,BOOK XXIII.,driving his steeds in front. Him when fleet-footed noble Achilles
12798,BOOK XXIII.,"beheld he pitied him, and he stood up and spake winged words among the"
12799,BOOK XXIII.,Argives: “Last driveth his whole-hooved horses the best man of them
12800,BOOK XXIII.,"all. But come let us give him a prize, as is seemly, prize for the"
12801,BOOK XXIII.,"second place, but the first let the son of Tydeus take.”"
12802,BOOK XXIII.,
12803,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus spake he, and all applauded that he bade. And he would have given"
12804,BOOK XXIII.,"him the mare, for the Achaians applauded, had not Antilochos, son of"
12805,BOOK XXIII.,great-hearted Nestor; risen up and answered Peleian Achilles on behalf
12806,BOOK XXIII.,"of his right: “O Achilles, I shall be sore angered with thee if thou"
12807,BOOK XXIII.,"accomplish this word, for thou art minded to take away my prize,"
12808,BOOK XXIII.,"because thou thinkest of how his chariot and fleet steeds miscarried,"
12809,BOOK XXIII.,"and himself withal, good man though he be. Nay, it behoved him to pray"
12810,BOOK XXIII.,"to the Immortals, then would he not have come in last of all in the"
12811,BOOK XXIII.,"race. But if thou pitiest him and he be dear to thy heart, there is"
12812,BOOK XXIII.,"much gold in thy hut, bronze is there and sheep, hand-maids are there"
12813,BOOK XXIII.,and whole-hooved horses. Thereof take thou and give unto him afterward
12814,BOOK XXIII.,"even a richer prize, or even now at once, that the Achaians may applaud"
12815,BOOK XXIII.,thee. But the mare I will not yield; for her let what man will essay
12816,BOOK XXIII.,the battle at my hands.”
12817,BOOK XXIII.,
12818,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus spake he, and fleet-footed noble Achilles smiled, pleased with"
12819,BOOK XXIII.,"Antilochos, for he was his dear comrade; and spake in answer to him"
12820,BOOK XXIII.,"winged words: “Antilochos, if thou wouldst have me give Eumelos some"
12821,BOOK XXIII.,"other thing beside from out my house, that also will I do. I will give"
12822,BOOK XXIII.,"unto him a breast-plate that I took from Asteropaios, of bronze,"
12823,BOOK XXIII.,"whereon a casting of bright tin is overlaid, and of great worth will it"
12824,BOOK XXIII.,"be to him.” He said, and bade his dear comrade Automedon bring it from"
12825,BOOK XXIII.,"the hut, and he went and brought it. [Then he placed it in Eumelos’"
12826,BOOK XXIII.,"hands, and he received it gladly.]"
12827,BOOK XXIII.,
12828,BOOK XXIII.,"But Menelaos also arose among them, sore at heart, angered exceedingly"
12829,BOOK XXIII.,"against Antilochos; and the herald set the staff in his hand, and"
12830,BOOK XXIII.,called for silence among the Argives; then spake among them that
12831,BOOK XXIII.,"godlike man: “Antilochos, who once wert wise, what thing is this thou"
12832,BOOK XXIII.,"hast done? Thou hast shamed my skill and made my horses fail, thrusting"
12833,BOOK XXIII.,"thine own in front that are far worse. Come now, ye chiefs and"
12834,BOOK XXIII.,"counsellors of the Argives, give judgment between us both, and favour"
12835,BOOK XXIII.,neither: lest some one of the mail-clad Achalans say at any time: ‘By
12836,BOOK XXIII.,constraining Antilochos through false words hath Menelaos gone off with
12837,BOOK XXIII.,"the mare, for his horses were far worse, howbeit he hath advantage in"
12838,BOOK XXIII.,"rank and power.’ Nay, I myself will bring the issue about, and I deem"
12839,BOOK XXIII.,"that none other of the Danaans shall reproach me, for the trial shall"
12840,BOOK XXIII.,"be just. Antilochos, fosterling of Zeus, come thou hither and as it is"
12841,BOOK XXIII.,ordained stand up before thy horses and chariot and take in thy hand
12842,BOOK XXIII.,"the pliant lash wherewith thou dravest erst, and touching thy horses"
12843,BOOK XXIII.,swear by the Enfolder and Shaker of the earth that not wilfully didst
12844,BOOK XXIII.,thou hinder my chariot by guile.”
12845,BOOK XXIII.,
12846,BOOK XXIII.,"Then answered him wise Antilochos: “Bear with me now, for far younger"
12847,BOOK XXIII.,"am I than thou, king Menelaos, and thou art before me and my better."
12848,BOOK XXIII.,"Thou knowest how a young man’s transgressions come about, for his mind"
12849,BOOK XXIII.,"is hastier and his counsel shallow. So let thy heart suffer me, and I"
12850,BOOK XXIII.,"will of myself give to thee the mare I have taken. Yea, if thou"
12851,BOOK XXIII.,"shouldst ask some other greater thing from my house, I were fain to"
12852,BOOK XXIII.,"give it thee straightway, rather than fall for ever from my place in"
12853,BOOK XXIII.,"thy heart, O fosterling of Zeus, and become a sinner against the gods.”"
12854,BOOK XXIII.,
12855,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus spake great-hearted Nestor’s son, and brought the mare and put her"
12856,BOOK XXIII.,in the hand of Menelaos. And his heart was gladdened as when the dew
12857,BOOK XXIII.,"cometh upon the ears of ripening harvest-corn, what time the fields are"
12858,BOOK XXIII.,"bristling. So gladdened was thy soul, Menelaos, within thy heart. And"
12859,BOOK XXIII.,"he spake unto Antilochos and uttered winged words: “Antilochos, now"
12860,BOOK XXIII.,"will I of myself put away mine anger against thee, since no wise"
12861,BOOK XXIII.,"formerly wert thou flighty or light-minded, howbeit now thy reason was"
12862,BOOK XXIII.,overcome of youthfulness. Another time be loth to outwit better men.
12863,BOOK XXIII.,"Not easily should another of the Achaians have persuaded me, but thou"
12864,BOOK XXIII.,"hast suffered and toiled greatly, and thy brave father and brother, for"
12865,BOOK XXIII.,"my sake: therefore will I hearken to thy prayer, and will even give"
12866,BOOK XXIII.,"unto thee the mare, though she is mine, that these also may know that"
12867,BOOK XXIII.,my heart was never overweening or implacable.”
12868,BOOK XXIII.,
12869,BOOK XXIII.,"He said, and gave the mare to Noemon Antilochos’ comrade to lead away,"
12870,BOOK XXIII.,and then took the shining caldron. And Meriones took up the two talents
12871,BOOK XXIII.,"of gold in the fourth place, as he had come in. So the fifth prize was"
12872,BOOK XXIII.,"left unclaimed, a two-handled cup; to Nester gave Achilles this,"
12873,BOOK XXIII.,"bearing it to him through the concourse of Argives, and stood by him"
12874,BOOK XXIII.,"and said: “Lo now for thee too, old man, be this a treasure, a memorial"
12875,BOOK XXIII.,of Patroklos’ burying; for no more shalt thou behold him among the
12876,BOOK XXIII.,"Argives. Now give I thee this prize unwon, for not in boxing shalt thou"
12877,BOOK XXIII.,"strive, neither wrestle, nor enter on the javelin match, nor race with"
12878,BOOK XXIII.,thy feet; for grim old age already weigheth on thee.”
12879,BOOK XXIII.,
12880,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus saying he placed it in his hand, and Nestor received it gladly,"
12881,BOOK XXIII.,"and spake unto him winged words: “Ay, truly all this, my son, thou hast"
12882,BOOK XXIII.,"meetly said; for no longer are my limbs, friend, firm, nor my feet, nor"
12883,BOOK XXIII.,do my arms at all swing lightly from my shoulders either side. Would
12884,BOOK XXIII.,that my youth were such and my force so firm as when the Epeians were
12885,BOOK XXIII.,"burying lord Amarynkes at Buprasion, and his sons held the king’s"
12886,BOOK XXIII.,"funeral games. Then was no man found like me, neither of the Epeians"
12887,BOOK XXIII.,nor of the Pylians themselves or the great-hearted Aitolians. In boxing
12888,BOOK XXIII.,"I overcame Klytomedes, son of Enops, and in wrestling Ankaios of"
12889,BOOK XXIII.,"Pleuron, who stood up against me, and in the foot-race I outran"
12890,BOOK XXIII.,"Iphiklos, a right good man, and with the spear outthrew Phyleus and"
12891,BOOK XXIII.,Polydoros; only in the chariot-race the two sons of Aktor beat me [by
12892,BOOK XXIII.,"crowding their horses in front of me, jealous for victory, because the"
12893,BOOK XXIII.,chief prizes were left at home.] Now they were twins—one ever held the
12894,BOOK XXIII.,"reins, the reins he ever held, the other called on the horses with the"
12895,BOOK XXIII.,"lash. Thus was I once, but now let younger men join in such feats; I"
12896,BOOK XXIII.,"must bend to grievous age, but then was I of mark among heroes. But"
12897,BOOK XXIII.,come hold funeral for thy comrade too with with games. This gift do I
12898,BOOK XXIII.,"accept with gladness, and my heart rejoiceth that thou rememberest ever"
12899,BOOK XXIII.,my friendship to thee—(nor forget I thee)—and the honour wherewith it
12900,BOOK XXIII.,is meet that I be honoured among the Achaians. And may the gods for
12901,BOOK XXIII.,this grant thee due grace.”
12902,BOOK XXIII.,
12903,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus spake he, and Peleides was gone down the full concourse of"
12904,BOOK XXIII.,"Achaians, when he had hearkened to all the thanks of Neleus’ son. Then"
12905,BOOK XXIII.,he ordained prizes of the violent boxing match; a sturdy mule he led
12906,BOOK XXIII.,"forth and tethered amid the assembly, a six-year mule unbroken, hardest"
12907,BOOK XXIII.,of all to break; and for the loser set a two-handled cup. Then he stood
12908,BOOK XXIII.,up and spake a word among the Argives: “Son of Atreus and ye other
12909,BOOK XXIII.,"well-greaved Achaians, for these rewards we summon two men of the best"
12910,BOOK XXIII.,to lift up their hands to box amain. He to whom Apollo shall grant
12911,BOOK XXIII.,"endurance to the end, and all the Achaians acknowledge it, let him take"
12912,BOOK XXIII.,the sturdy mule and return with her to his hut; and the loser shall
12913,BOOK XXIII.,take with him the two-handled-cup.”
12914,BOOK XXIII.,
12915,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus spake he, and forthwith arose a man great and valiant and skilled"
12916,BOOK XXIII.,"in boxing, Epeios son of Panopeus, and laid his hand on the sturdy mule"
12917,BOOK XXIII.,and said aloud: “Let one come nigh to bear off the two-handled cup; the
12918,BOOK XXIII.,mule I say none other of the Achaians shall take for victory with his
12919,BOOK XXIII.,"fists, for I claim to be the best man here. Sufficeth it not that I"
12920,BOOK XXIII.,fall short of you in battle? Not possible is it that in all arts a man
12921,BOOK XXIII.,"be skilled. Thus proclaim I, and it shall be accomplished: I will"
12922,BOOK XXIII.,"utterly bruise mine adversary’s flesh and break his bones, so let his"
12923,BOOK XXIII.,friends abide together here to bear him forth when vanquished by my
12924,BOOK XXIII.,hands.”
12925,BOOK XXIII.,
12926,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus spake he, and they all kept deep silence. And alone arose against"
12927,BOOK XXIII.,"him Euryalos, a godlike man, son of king Mekisteus the son of Talaos,"
12928,BOOK XXIII.,"Mekisteus, who came on a time to Thebes when Oedipus had fallen, to his"
12929,BOOK XXIII.,"burial, and there he overcame all the sons of Kadmos. Thus Tydeides"
12930,BOOK XXIII.,"famous with the spear made ready Euryalos for the fight, cheering him"
12931,BOOK XXIII.,"with speech, and greatly desired for him victory. And first he cast"
12932,BOOK XXIII.,"about him a girdle, and next gave him well-cut thongs of the hide of an"
12933,BOOK XXIII.,ox of the field. And the two boxers being girt went into the midst of
12934,BOOK XXIII.,"the ring, and both lifting up their stalwart hands fell to, and their"
12935,BOOK XXIII.,hands joined battle grievously. Then was there terrible grinding of
12936,BOOK XXIII.,"teeth, and sweat flowed from all their limbs. And noble Epeios came on,"
12937,BOOK XXIII.,"and as the other spied for an opening, smote him on the cheek, nor"
12938,BOOK XXIII.,"could he much more stand, for his limbs failed straightway under him."
12939,BOOK XXIII.,And as when beneath the North Wind’s ripple a fish leapeth on a
12940,BOOK XXIII.,"tangle-covered beach, and then the black wave hideth it, so leapt up"
12941,BOOK XXIII.,Euryalos at that blow. But great-hearted Epeios took him in his hands
12942,BOOK XXIII.,"and set him upright, and his dear comrades stood around him, and led"
12943,BOOK XXIII.,"him through the ring with trailing feet, spitting out clotted blood,"
12944,BOOK XXIII.,"drooping his head awry, and they set him down in his swoon among them"
12945,BOOK XXIII.,and themselves went forth and fetched the two-handled cup.
12946,BOOK XXIII.,
12947,BOOK XXIII.,"Then Peleus’ son ordained straightway the prizes for a third contest,"
12948,BOOK XXIII.,"offering them to the Danaans, for the grievous wrestling match: for the"
12949,BOOK XXIII.,"winner a great tripod for standing on the fire, prized by the Achaians"
12950,BOOK XXIII.,among them at twelve oxens’ worth; and for the loser he brought a woman
12951,BOOK XXIII.,"into the midst, skilled in manifold work, and they prized her at four"
12952,BOOK XXIII.,"oxen. And he stood up and spake a word among the Argives: “Rise, ye who"
12953,BOOK XXIII.,will essay this match.”
12954,BOOK XXIII.,
12955,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus said he, and there arose great Aias son of Telamon, and Odysseus"
12956,BOOK XXIII.,"of many wiles stood up, the crafty-minded. And the twain being girt"
12957,BOOK XXIII.,"went into the midst of the ring, and clasped each the other in his arms"
12958,BOOK XXIII.,"with stalwart hands, like gable rafters of a lofty house which some"
12959,BOOK XXIII.,"famed craftsman joineth, that he may baffle the wind’s force. And their"
12960,BOOK XXIII.,"backs creaked, gripped firmly under the vigorous hands, and sweat ran"
12961,BOOK XXIII.,"down in streams, and frequent weals along their ribs and shoulders"
12962,BOOK XXIII.,"sprang up, red with blood, while ever they strove amain for victory, to"
12963,BOOK XXIII.,win the wrought tripod. Neither could Odysseus trip Aias and bear him
12964,BOOK XXIII.,"to the ground, nor Aias him, for Odysseus’ strength withheld him. But"
12965,BOOK XXIII.,"when they began to irk the well-greaved Achaians, then said to Odysseus"
12966,BOOK XXIII.,"great Aias, Telamon’s son: “Heaven-sprung son of Laertes, Odysseus of"
12967,BOOK XXIII.,"many wiles, or lift thou me, or I will thee, and the issue shall be"
12968,BOOK XXIII.,with Zeus.”
12969,BOOK XXIII.,
12970,BOOK XXIII.,"Having thus said he lifted him, but Odysseus was not unmindful of his"
12971,BOOK XXIII.,"craft. He smote deftly from behind the hollow of Aias’ knee, and loosed"
12972,BOOK XXIII.,"his limbs, and threw him down backward, and Odysseus fell upon his"
12973,BOOK XXIII.,"chest, and the folk gazed and marvelled. Then in his turn much-enduring"
12974,BOOK XXIII.,"noble Odysseus tried to lift, and moved him a little from the ground,"
12975,BOOK XXIII.,"but lifted him not, so he crooked his knee within the other’s, and both"
12976,BOOK XXIII.,"fell on the ground nigh to each other, and were soiled with dust, And"
12977,BOOK XXIII.,"now starting up again a third time would they have wrestled, had not"
12978,BOOK XXIII.,Achilles himself arisen and held them back: “No longer press each the
12979,BOOK XXIII.,"other, nor wear you out with pain. Victory is with both; take equal"
12980,BOOK XXIII.,"prizes and depart, that other Achaians may contend.”"
12981,BOOK XXIII.,
12982,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus spake he, and they were fain to hear and to obey, and wiped the"
12983,BOOK XXIII.,dust from them and put their doublets on.
12984,BOOK XXIII.,
12985,BOOK XXIII.,Then straightway the son of Peleus set forth other prizes for fleetness
12986,BOOK XXIII.,"of foot; a mixing-bowl of silver, chased; six measures it held, and in"
12987,BOOK XXIII.,"beauty it was far the best in all the earth, for artificers of Sidon"
12988,BOOK XXIII.,"wrought it cunningly, and men of the Phoenicians brought it over the"
12989,BOOK XXIII.,"misty sea, and landed it in harbour, and gave it a gift to Thoas; and"
12990,BOOK XXIII.,Euneos son of Jason gave it to the hero Patroklos a ransom for Lykaon
12991,BOOK XXIII.,Priam’s son. Now this cup did Achilles set forth as a prize in honour
12992,BOOK XXIII.,"of his friend, for whoso should be fleetest in speed of foot. For the"
12993,BOOK XXIII.,"second he set an ox great and very fat, and for the last prize half a"
12994,BOOK XXIII.,talent of gold. And he stood up and spake a word among the Argives:
12995,BOOK XXIII.,"“Rise, ye who will essay this match.”"
12996,BOOK XXIII.,
12997,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus spake he, and straightway arose fleet Aias Oileus’ son, and"
12998,BOOK XXIII.,"Odysseus of many wiles, and after them Nestor’s son Antilochos, for he"
12999,BOOK XXIII.,was best of all the youth in the foot-race. Then they stood side by
13000,BOOK XXIII.,"side, and Achilles showed to them the goal. Right eager was the running"
13001,BOOK XXIII.,"from the start, but Oileus’ son forthwith shot to the front, and close"
13002,BOOK XXIII.,"behind him came noble Odysseus, as close as is a weaving-rod to a"
13003,BOOK XXIII.,"fair-girdled woman’s breast when she pulleth it deftly with her hands,"
13004,BOOK XXIII.,"drawing the spool along the warp, and holdeth the rod nigh her breast—"
13005,BOOK XXIII.,so close ran Odysseus behind Aias and trod in his footsteps or ever the
13006,BOOK XXIII.,"dust had settled there, and on his head fell the breath of noble"
13007,BOOK XXIII.,"Odysseus as he ran ever lightly on, and all the Achaians applauded his"
13008,BOOK XXIII.,struggle for the victory and called on him as he laboured hard. But
13009,BOOK XXIII.,"when they were running the last part of the course, forthwith Odysseus"
13010,BOOK XXIII.,"prayed in his soul to bright-eyed Athene: “Hearken, goddess, come thou"
13011,BOOK XXIII.,a good helper of my feet.”
13012,BOOK XXIII.,
13013,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus prayed he, and Pallas Athene hearkened to him, and made his limbs"
13014,BOOK XXIII.,"feel light, both feet and hands. But when they, were now nigh darting"
13015,BOOK XXIII.,"on the prize, then Aias slipped as he ran, for Athene marred his race,"
13016,BOOK XXIII.,where filth was strewn from the slaughter of loud-bellowing oxen that
13017,BOOK XXIII.,fleet Achilles slew in honour of Patroklos: and Aias’ mouth and
13018,BOOK XXIII.,nostrils were filled with that filth of oxen. So much-enduring noble
13019,BOOK XXIII.,"Odysseus, as he came in first, took up the mixing-bowl, and famous Aias"
13020,BOOK XXIII.,took the ox. And he stood holding in his hand the horn of the ox of the
13021,BOOK XXIII.,"field, sputtering away the filth, and spake among the Argives: “Out on"
13022,BOOK XXIII.,"it, it was the goddess who marred my running, she who from of old like"
13023,BOOK XXIII.,a mother standeth by Odysseus’ side and helpeth him.”
13024,BOOK XXIII.,
13025,BOOK XXIII.,"So spake he, but they all laughed pleasantly to behold him. Then"
13026,BOOK XXIII.,"Antilochos smiling bore off the last prize, and spake his word among"
13027,BOOK XXIII.,"the Argives: “Friends, ye will all bear me witness when I say that even"
13028,BOOK XXIII.,herein also the immortals favour elder men. For Aias is a little older
13029,BOOK XXIII.,"than I, but Odysseus of an earlier generation and earlier race of men."
13030,BOOK XXIII.,"A green old age is his, they say, and hard were it for any Achaian to"
13031,BOOK XXIII.,"rival him in speed, save only Achilles.”"
13032,BOOK XXIII.,
13033,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus spake he, and gave honour to the fleet son of Peleus. And Achilles"
13034,BOOK XXIII.,"answered him and said: “Antilochos, not unheeded shall thy praise be"
13035,BOOK XXIII.,"given; a half-talent of gold I will give thee over and above.” He said,"
13036,BOOK XXIII.,"and set it in his hands, and Antilochos received it gladly."
13037,BOOK XXIII.,
13038,BOOK XXIII.,Then Peleus’ son brought and set in the ring a far-shadowing spear and
13039,BOOK XXIII.,"a chaldron that knew not the fire, an ox’s worth, embossed with"
13040,BOOK XXIII.,flowers; and men that were casters of the javelin arose up. There rose
13041,BOOK XXIII.,"Atreus’ son wide-ruling Agamemnon, and Meriones, Idomeneus’ brave"
13042,BOOK XXIII.,squire. And swift-footed noble Achilles spake among them: “Son of
13043,BOOK XXIII.,"Atreus, for that we know how far thou excellest all, and how far the"
13044,BOOK XXIII.,"first thou art in the might of thy throw, take thou this prize with"
13045,BOOK XXIII.,"thee to the hollow ships, and to the hero Meriones let us give the"
13046,BOOK XXIII.,"spear, if thou art willing in thy heart: thus I at least advise.”"
13047,BOOK XXIII.,
13048,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus spake he, nor disregarded him Agamemnon king of men. So to"
13049,BOOK XXIII.,"Meriones he gave the spear of bronze, but to the herald Talthybios the"
13050,BOOK XXIII.,hero gave the goodliest prize.
13051,BOOK XXIII.,
13052,BOOK XXIII.,
13053,BOOK XXIII.,
13054,BOOK XXIII.,
13055,BOOK XXIV.,BOOK XXIV.
13056,BOOK XXIV.,
13057,BOOK XXIV.,
13058,BOOK XXIV.,"How the body of Hector was ransomed, and of his funeral."
13059,BOOK XXIV.,
13060,BOOK XXIV.,
13061,BOOK XXIV.,"Then the assembly was broken up, and the tribes were scattered to"
13062,BOOK XXIV.,betake them each to their own swift ships. The rest bethought them of
13063,BOOK XXIV.,"supper and sweet sleep to have joy thereof; but Achilles wept,"
13064,BOOK XXIV.,"remembering his dear comrade, nor did sleep that conquereth all take"
13065,BOOK XXIV.,"hold on him, but he kept turning him to this side and to that, yearning"
13066,BOOK XXIV.,"for Patroklos’ manhood and excellent valour, and all the toils he"
13067,BOOK XXIV.,"achieved with him and the woes he bare, cleaving the battles of men and"
13068,BOOK XXIV.,"the grievous waves. As he thought thereon be shed big tears, now lying"
13069,BOOK XXIV.,"on his side, now on his back, now on his face; and then anon he would"
13070,BOOK XXIV.,arise upon his feet and roam wildly beside the beach of the salt sea.
13071,BOOK XXIV.,Nor would he be unaware of the Dawn when she arose over the sea and
13072,BOOK XXIV.,shores. But when he had yoked the swift steeds to his car he would bind
13073,BOOK XXIV.,Hector behind his chariot to drag him withal; and having thrice drawn
13074,BOOK XXIV.,him round the barrow of the dead son of Menoitios he rested again in
13075,BOOK XXIV.,"his hut, and left Hector lying stretched on his face in the dust. But"
13076,BOOK XXIV.,"Apollo kept away all defacement from his flesh, for he had pity on him"
13077,BOOK XXIV.,"even in death, and covered him all with his golden aegis, that Achilles"
13078,BOOK XXIV.,might not tear him when he dragged him.
13079,BOOK XXIV.,
13080,BOOK XXIV.,Thus Achilles in his anger entreated noble Hector shamefully; but the
13081,BOOK XXIV.,"blessed gods when they beheld him pitied him, and urged the"
13082,BOOK XXIV.,clear-sighted slayer of Argus to steal the corpse away. So to all the
13083,BOOK XXIV.,"others seemed it good, yet not to Hera or Poseidon or the bright-eyed"
13084,BOOK XXIV.,"Maiden, but they continued as when at the beginning sacred Ilios became"
13085,BOOK XXIV.,"hateful to them, and Priam and his people, by reason of the sin of"
13086,BOOK XXIV.,Alexandros in that he contemned those goddesses when they came to his
13087,BOOK XXIV.,"steading, and preferred her who brought him deadly lustfulness. But"
13088,BOOK XXIV.,"when the twelfth morn from that day arose, then spake among the"
13089,BOOK XXIV.,"Immortals Phoebus Apollo: “Hard of heart are ye, O gods, and cruel Hath"
13090,BOOK XXIV.,Hector never burnt for you thigh-bones of unblemished bulls and goats?
13091,BOOK XXIV.,Now have ye not taken heart to rescue even his corpse for his wife to
13092,BOOK XXIV.,look upon and his mother and his child and his father Priam and his
13093,BOOK XXIV.,"people, who speedily would burn him in the fire and make his funeral."
13094,BOOK XXIV.,"But fell Achilles, O gods, ye are fain to abet, whose mind is nowise"
13095,BOOK XXIV.,"just nor the purpose in his breast to be turned away, but he is cruelly"
13096,BOOK XXIV.,minded as a lion that in great strength and at the bidding of his proud
13097,BOOK XXIV.,heart goeth forth against men’s flocks to make his meal; even thus
13098,BOOK XXIV.,"Achilles hath cast out pity, neither hath he shame, that doth both harm"
13099,BOOK XXIV.,and profit men greatly. It must be that many a man lose even some
13100,BOOK XXIV.,"dearer one than was this, a brother of the same womb born or perchance"
13101,BOOK XXIV.,"a son; yet bringeth he his wailing and lamentation to an end, for an"
13102,BOOK XXIV.,enduring soul have the Fates given unto men. But Achilles after
13103,BOOK XXIV.,bereaving noble Hector of his life bindeth him behind his horses and
13104,BOOK XXIV.,"draggeth him around the tomb of his dear comrade: not, verily, is that"
13105,BOOK XXIV.,more honourable or better for him. Let him take heed lest we wax wroth
13106,BOOK XXIV.,"with him, good man though he be, for in his fury he is entreating"
13107,BOOK XXIV.,shamefully the senseless clay.”
13108,BOOK XXIV.,
13109,BOOK XXIV.,Then in anger spake unto him white-armed Hera: “Even thus mightest thou
13110,BOOK XXIV.,"speak, O Lord of the silver bow, if ye are to give equal honour to"
13111,BOOK XXIV.,Achilles and to Hector. Hector is but a mortal and was suckled at a
13112,BOOK XXIV.,"woman’s breast, but Achilles is child of a goddess whom I myself bred"
13113,BOOK XXIV.,"up and reared and gave to a man to be his wife, even to Peleus who was"
13114,BOOK XXIV.,dearest of all men to the Immortals’ heart. And all ye gods came to her
13115,BOOK XXIV.,"bridal, and thou among them wert feasting with thy lyre, O lover of ill"
13116,BOOK XXIV.,"company, faithless ever.”"
13117,BOOK XXIV.,
13118,BOOK XXIV.,"Then to her in answer spake Zeus who gathereth the clouds: “Hera, be"
13119,BOOK XXIV.,not wroth utterly with the gods: for these men’s honour is not to be
13120,BOOK XXIV.,"the same, yet Hector also was dearest to the gods of all mortals that"
13121,BOOK XXIV.,"are in Ilios. So was he to me at least, for nowise failed he in the"
13122,BOOK XXIV.,"gifts I loved. Never did my altar lack seemly feast, drink-offering and"
13123,BOOK XXIV.,"the steam of sacrifice, even the honour that falleth to our due. But"
13124,BOOK XXIV.,"verily we will say no more of stealing away brave Hector, for it cannot"
13125,BOOK XXIV.,"be hidden from Achilles, for his mother abideth ever nigh to him night"
13126,BOOK XXIV.,and day. But I were fain that some one of the gods would call Thetis to
13127,BOOK XXIV.,"come near to me, that I may speak unto her a wise word, so that"
13128,BOOK XXIV.,Achilles may take gifts from Priam and give Hector back.” Thus spake
13129,BOOK XXIV.,"he, and airy-footed Iris sped forth upon the errand and between"
13130,BOOK XXIV.,"Samothrace and rocky Imbros leapt into the black sea, and the waters"
13131,BOOK XXIV.,closed above her with a noise. And she sped to the bottom like a weight
13132,BOOK XXIV.,of lead that mounted on horn of a field-ox goeth down bearing death to
13133,BOOK XXIV.,ravenous fishes. And she found Thetis in a hollow cave; about her sat
13134,BOOK XXIV.,gathered other goddesses of the seas and she in their midst was wailing
13135,BOOK XXIV.,"for the fate of her noble son who must perish in deep-soiled Troy, far"
13136,BOOK XXIV.,"from his native land. And standing near, fleet-footed Iris spake to"
13137,BOOK XXIV.,"her: “Rise, Thetis; Zeus of immortal counsels calleth thee.”"
13138,BOOK XXIV.,
13139,BOOK XXIV.,And to her made answer Thetis the silver-footed goddess: “Wherefore
13140,BOOK XXIV.,"biddeth me that mighty god? I shrink from mingling among the Immortals,"
13141,BOOK XXIV.,"for I have countless woes at heart. Yet go I, nor shall his word be in"
13142,BOOK XXIV.,"vain, whatsoever he saith.”"
13143,BOOK XXIV.,
13144,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus having said the noble goddess took to her a dark-hued robe, no"
13145,BOOK XXIV.,"blacker raiment was there found than that. Then she went forth, and"
13146,BOOK XXIV.,"wind-footed swift Iris led the way before her, and around them the"
13147,BOOK XXIV.,surge of the sea was sundered. And when they had come forth upon the
13148,BOOK XXIV.,"shore they sped up to heaven, and found the far-seeing son of Kronos,"
13149,BOOK XXIV.,and round him sat gathered all the other blessed gods that are for
13150,BOOK XXIV.,"ever. Then she sat down beside father Zeus, and Athene gave her place."
13151,BOOK XXIV.,"And Hera set a fair golden cup in her hand and cheered her with words,"
13152,BOOK XXIV.,"and Thetis drank, and gave back the cup. Then began speech to them the"
13153,BOOK XXIV.,"father of gods and men: “Thou art come to Olympus, divine Thetis, in"
13154,BOOK XXIV.,"thy sorrow, with violent grief at thy heart; I know it of myself."
13155,BOOK XXIV.,Nevertheless will I tell thee wherefore I called thee hither. Nine days
13156,BOOK XXIV.,hath dispute arisen among the Immortals concerning the corpse of Hector
13157,BOOK XXIV.,and Achilles waster of cities. Fain are they to send clear-sighted
13158,BOOK XXIV.,"Hermes to steal the body away, but now hear what glory I accord herein"
13159,BOOK XXIV.,"to Achilles, that I may keep through times to come thy honour and good"
13160,BOOK XXIV.,will. Go with all speed to the host and bear to thy son my bidding. Say
13161,BOOK XXIV.,"to him that the gods are displeased at him, and that I above all"
13162,BOOK XXIV.,"Immortals am wroth, because with furious heart be holdeth Hector at the"
13163,BOOK XXIV.,"beaked ships and hath not given him back, if haply he may fear me and"
13164,BOOK XXIV.,give Hector back. But I will send Iris to great-hearted Priam to bid
13165,BOOK XXIV.,"him go to the ships of the Achaians to ransom his dear son, and carry"
13166,BOOK XXIV.,gifts to Achilles that may gladden his heart.”
13167,BOOK XXIV.,
13168,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus spake he, and Thetis the silver-footed goddess was not disobedient"
13169,BOOK XXIV.,"to his word, and sped darting upon her way down from the peaks of"
13170,BOOK XXIV.,Olympus. And she came to her son’s hut; there found she him making
13171,BOOK XXIV.,"grievous moan, and his dear comrades round were swiftly making ready"
13172,BOOK XXIV.,"and furnishing their early meal, and a sheep great and fleecy was being"
13173,BOOK XXIV.,sacrificed in the hut. Then his lady-mother sate her down close beside
13174,BOOK XXIV.,"him, and stroked him with her hand and spake to him by his name: “My"
13175,BOOK XXIV.,"child, how long with lamentation and woe wilt thou devour thine heart,"
13176,BOOK XXIV.,taking thought of neither food nor rest? good were even a woman’s
13177,BOOK XXIV.,"embrace, for not long shalt thou be left alive to me; already death and"
13178,BOOK XXIV.,"forceful fate are standing nigh thee. But hearken forthwith unto me,"
13179,BOOK XXIV.,for I am the messenger of Zeus to thee. He saith that the gods are
13180,BOOK XXIV.,"displeased at thee, and that himself above all Immortals is wroth,"
13181,BOOK XXIV.,because with furious heart thou holdest Hector at the beaked ships and
13182,BOOK XXIV.,"hast not given him back. But come restore him, and take ransom for the"
13183,BOOK XXIV.,dead.”
13184,BOOK XXIV.,
13185,BOOK XXIV.,Then to her in answer spake fleet-footed Achilles: “So be it: whoso
13186,BOOK XXIV.,"bringeth ransom let him take back the dead, if verily with heart’s"
13187,BOOK XXIV.,intent the Olympian biddeth it himself.”
13188,BOOK XXIV.,
13189,BOOK XXIV.,"So they in the assembly of the ships, mother and son, spake to each"
13190,BOOK XXIV.,other many winged words. But the son of Kronos thus bade Iris go to
13191,BOOK XXIV.,"holy Ilios: “Go forth, fleet Iris, leave the abode of Olympus and bear"
13192,BOOK XXIV.,my message within Ilios to great-hearted Priam that he go to the ships
13193,BOOK XXIV.,of the Achaians and ransom his dear son and carry gifts to Achilles
13194,BOOK XXIV.,"that may gladden his heart; let him go alone, and no other man of the"
13195,BOOK XXIV.,Trojans go with him. Only let some elder herald attend on him to guide
13196,BOOK XXIV.,the mules and smooth-wheeled waggon and carry back to the city the dead
13197,BOOK XXIV.,man whom noble Achilles slew. Let not death be in his thought nor any
13198,BOOK XXIV.,"fear; such guide will we give unto him, even the slyer of Argus who"
13199,BOOK XXIV.,shall lead him until his leading bring him to Achilles. And when he
13200,BOOK XXIV.,"shall have led him within the hut, neither shall Achilles himself slay"
13201,BOOK XXIV.,"him nor suffer any other herein, for not senseless is he or"
13202,BOOK XXIV.,"unforeseeing or wicked, but with all courtesy he will spare a suppliant"
13203,BOOK XXIV.,man.”
13204,BOOK XXIV.,
13205,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus spake he, and airy-footed Iris sped forth upon the errand. And she"
13206,BOOK XXIV.,"came to the house of Priam, and found therein crying and moan. His"
13207,BOOK XXIV.,children sitting around their father within the court were bedewing
13208,BOOK XXIV.,"their raiment with their tears, and the old man in their midst was"
13209,BOOK XXIV.,close wrapped all over in his cloak; and on his head and neck was much
13210,BOOK XXIV.,mire that he had gathered in his hands as he grovelled upon the earth.
13211,BOOK XXIV.,And his daughters and his sons’ wives were wailing throughout the
13212,BOOK XXIV.,"house, bethinking them of all those valiant men who had lost their"
13213,BOOK XXIV.,lives at the hands of the Argives and were lying low. And the messenger
13214,BOOK XXIV.,"of Zeus stood beside Priam and spake softly unto him, and trembling"
13215,BOOK XXIV.,"came upon his limbs: “Be of good cheer in thy heart, O Priam son of"
13216,BOOK XXIV.,"Dardanos, and be not dismayed for anything, for no evil come I hither"
13217,BOOK XXIV.,"to forebode to thee, but with good will. I am the messenger of Zeus to"
13218,BOOK XXIV.,"thee, who, though he be afar off, hath great care and pity for thee."
13219,BOOK XXIV.,The Olympian biddeth thee ransom noble Hector and carry gifts to
13220,BOOK XXIV.,"Achilles that may gladden his heart: go thou alone, let none other of"
13221,BOOK XXIV.,the Trojans go with thee. Only let some elder herald attend on thee to
13222,BOOK XXIV.,guide the mules and the smooth-wheeled waggon to carry back to the city
13223,BOOK XXIV.,"the dead man whom noble Achilles slew. Let not death be in thy thought,"
13224,BOOK XXIV.,"nor any fear; such guide shall go with thee, even the slayer of Argus,"
13225,BOOK XXIV.,who shall lead thee until his leading bring thee to Achilles. And when
13226,BOOK XXIV.,"he shall have led thee into the hut, neither shall Achilles himself"
13227,BOOK XXIV.,"slay thee, nor suffer any other herein, for not senseless is he or"
13228,BOOK XXIV.,"unforeseeing or wicked, but with all courtesy he will spare a suppliant"
13229,BOOK XXIV.,man.”
13230,BOOK XXIV.,
13231,BOOK XXIV.,Thus having spoken fleet Iris departed from him; and he bade his sons
13232,BOOK XXIV.,"make ready the smooth-wheeled mule waggon, and bind the wicker carriage"
13233,BOOK XXIV.,"thereon. And himself he went down to his fragrant chamber, of cedar"
13234,BOOK XXIV.,"wood, high-roofed, that held full many jewels: and to Hekabe his wife"
13235,BOOK XXIV.,"he called and spake: “Lady, from Zeus hath an Olympian messenger come"
13236,BOOK XXIV.,"to me, that I go to the ships of the Achaians and ransom my dear son,"
13237,BOOK XXIV.,and carry gifts to Achilles that may gladden his heart. Come tell me
13238,BOOK XXIV.,"how seemeth it to thy mind, for of myself at least my desire and heart"
13239,BOOK XXIV.,bid me mightily to go thither to the ships and enter the wide camp of
13240,BOOK XXIV.,the Achaians.”
13241,BOOK XXIV.,
13242,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus spake he, but his wife lamented aloud and made answer to him: “Woe"
13243,BOOK XXIV.,"is me, whither is gone thy mind whereby aforetime thou wert famous"
13244,BOOK XXIV.,among stranger men and among them thou rulest? How art thou fain to go
13245,BOOK XXIV.,"alone to the ships of the Achaians, to meet the eyes of the man who"
13246,BOOK XXIV.,hath slain full many of thy brave sons? of iron verily is thy heart.
13247,BOOK XXIV.,"For if he light on thee and behold thee with his eyes, a savage and"
13248,BOOK XXIV.,"ill-trusted man is this, and he will not pity thee, neither reverence"
13249,BOOK XXIV.,"thee at all. Nay, now let us sit in the hall and make lament afar off."
13250,BOOK XXIV.,Even thus did forceful Fate erst spin for Hector with her thread at his
13251,BOOK XXIV.,"beginning when I bare him, even I, that he should glut fleet-footed"
13252,BOOK XXIV.,"dogs, far from his parents, in the dwelling of a violent man whose"
13253,BOOK XXIV.,inmost vitals I were fain to fasten and feed upon; then would his deeds
13254,BOOK XXIV.,"against my son be paid again to him, for not playing the coward was he"
13255,BOOK XXIV.,"slain of him, but championing the men and deep-bosomed women of Troy,"
13256,BOOK XXIV.,neither bethought he him of shelter or of flight.”
13257,BOOK XXIV.,
13258,BOOK XXIV.,"The to her in answer spake the old man godlike Priam: “Stay me not, for"
13259,BOOK XXIV.,"I am fain to go, neither be thyself a bird of ill boding in my halls,"
13260,BOOK XXIV.,for thou wilt not change my mind. Were it some other and a child of
13261,BOOK XXIV.,"earth that bade me this, whether some seer or of the priests that"
13262,BOOK XXIV.,"divine from sacrifice, then would we declare it false and have no part"
13263,BOOK XXIV.,"therein; but now, since I have heard the voice of the goddess myself"
13264,BOOK XXIV.,"and looked upon her face, I will go forth, and her word shall not be"
13265,BOOK XXIV.,void. And if it be my fate to die by the ships of the mail-clad
13266,BOOK XXIV.,"Achaians, so would I have it; let Achilles slay me with all speed, when"
13267,BOOK XXIV.,"once I have taken in my arms my son, and have satisfied my desire with"
13268,BOOK XXIV.,moan.”
13269,BOOK XXIV.,
13270,BOOK XXIV.,"He spake, and opened fair lids of chests wherefrom he chose twelve very"
13271,BOOK XXIV.,goodly women’s robes and twelve cloaks of single fold and of coverlets
13272,BOOK XXIV.,"a like number and of fair sheets, and of doublets thereupon. And he"
13273,BOOK XXIV.,"weighed and brought forth talents of gold ten in all, and two shining"
13274,BOOK XXIV.,"tripods and four caldrons, and a goblet exceeding fair that men of"
13275,BOOK XXIV.,"Thrace had given him when he went thither on an embassy, a chattel of"
13276,BOOK XXIV.,"great price, yet not that even did the old man grudge from his halls,"
13277,BOOK XXIV.,for he was exceeding fain at heart to ransom his dear son. Then he
13278,BOOK XXIV.,"drave out all the Trojans from the colonnade, chiding them with words"
13279,BOOK XXIV.,"of rebuke: “Begone, ye that dishonour and do me shame! Have ye no"
13280,BOOK XXIV.,mourning of your own at home that ye come to vex me here? Think ye it a
13281,BOOK XXIV.,"small thing that Zeus Kronos’ son hath given me this sorrow, to lose"
13282,BOOK XXIV.,"him that was the best man of my sons? Nay, but ye too shall feel it,"
13283,BOOK XXIV.,for easier far shall ye be to the Achaians to slay now he is dead. But
13284,BOOK XXIV.,"for me, ere I behold with mine eyes the city sacked and wasted, let me"
13285,BOOK XXIV.,go down into the house of Hades.”
13286,BOOK XXIV.,
13287,BOOK XXIV.,"He said, and with his staff chased forth the men, and they went forth"
13288,BOOK XXIV.,"before the old man in his haste. Then he called unto his sons, chiding"
13289,BOOK XXIV.,"Helenos and Paris and noble Agathon and Pammon and Antiphonos, and"
13290,BOOK XXIV.,"Polites of the loud war-cry, and Deiphobos and Hippothoos and proud"
13291,BOOK XXIV.,Dios; nine were they whom the old man called and bade unto him: “Haste
13292,BOOK XXIV.,"ye, ill sons, my shame; would that ye all in Hector’s stead had been"
13293,BOOK XXIV.,"slain at the swift ships! Woe is me all unblest, since I begat sons the"
13294,BOOK XXIV.,"best men in wide Troy-land, but none of them is left for me to claim,"
13295,BOOK XXIV.,"neither godlike Mestor, nor Troilos with his chariot of war, nor Hector"
13296,BOOK XXIV.,"who was a god among men, neither seemed he as the son of a mortal man"
13297,BOOK XXIV.,"but of a god:—all these hath Ares slain, and here are my shames all"
13298,BOOK XXIV.,"left to me, false-tongued, light-heeled, the heroes of dance,"
13299,BOOK XXIV.,plunderers of your own people’s sheep and kids. Will ye not make me
13300,BOOK XXIV.,"ready a wain with all speed, and lay all these thereon, that we get us"
13301,BOOK XXIV.,forward on our way?”
13302,BOOK XXIV.,
13303,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus spake he, and they fearing their father’s voice brought forth the"
13304,BOOK XXIV.,"smooth-running mule chariot, fair and new, and bound the body thereof"
13305,BOOK XXIV.,"on the frame; and from its peg they took down the mule yoke, a boxwood"
13306,BOOK XXIV.,yoke with knob well fitted with guiding-rings; and they brought forth
13307,BOOK XXIV.,the yoke-band of nine cubits with the yoke. The yoke they set firmly on
13308,BOOK XXIV.,"the polished pole on the rest at the end thereof, and slipped the ring"
13309,BOOK XXIV.,"over the upright pin, which with three turns of the band they lashed to"
13310,BOOK XXIV.,"the knob, and then belayed it close round the pole and turned the"
13311,BOOK XXIV.,tongue thereunder. Then they brought from the chamber and heaped on the
13312,BOOK XXIV.,"polished wain the countless ransom of Hector’s head, and yoked"
13313,BOOK XXIV.,"strong-hooved harness mules, which on a time the Mysians gave to Priam,"
13314,BOOK XXIV.,a splendid gift. But to Priam’s car they yoked the horses that the old
13315,BOOK XXIV.,man kept for his use and reared at the polished crib.
13316,BOOK XXIV.,
13317,BOOK XXIV.,Thus in the high palace were Priam and the herald letting yoke their
13318,BOOK XXIV.,"cars, with wise thoughts at their hearts, when nigh came Hekabe sore at"
13319,BOOK XXIV.,"heart, with honey-sweet wine in her right hand in a golden cup that"
13320,BOOK XXIV.,they might make libation ere they went. And she stood before the horses
13321,BOOK XXIV.,and spake a word to Priam by name: “Lo now make libation to father Zeus
13322,BOOK XXIV.,"and pray that thou mayest come back home from among the enemy, since"
13323,BOOK XXIV.,"thy heart speedeth thee forth to the ships, though fain were I thou"
13324,BOOK XXIV.,"wentest not. And next pray to Kronion of the Storm-cloud, the gods of"
13325,BOOK XXIV.,"Ida, that beholdeth all Troy-land beneath, and ask of him a bird of"
13326,BOOK XXIV.,"omen, even the swift messenger that is dearest of all birds to him and"
13327,BOOK XXIV.,"of mightiest strength, to appear upon thy right, that seeing the sign"
13328,BOOK XXIV.,with thine own eyes thou mayest go in trust thereto unto the ships of
13329,BOOK XXIV.,the fleet-horsed Danaans. But if far-seeing Zeus shall not grant unto
13330,BOOK XXIV.,"thee his messenger, I at least shall not bid thee on to go among the"
13331,BOOK XXIV.,ships of the Achaians how fain soever thou mayest be.”
13332,BOOK XXIV.,
13333,BOOK XXIV.,"Then answered and spake unto her godlike Priam: “Lady, I will not"
13334,BOOK XXIV.,"disregard this hest of thine, for good it is to lift up hands to Zeus,"
13335,BOOK XXIV.,if haply he will have pity.”
13336,BOOK XXIV.,
13337,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus spake the old man, and bade a house-dame that served him pour pure"
13338,BOOK XXIV.,water on his hands; and she came near to serve him with water in a ewer
13339,BOOK XXIV.,to wash withal. And when he had washed his hands he took a goblet from
13340,BOOK XXIV.,his wife: then he stood in the midst of the court and prayed and poured
13341,BOOK XXIV.,"forth wine as he looked up to heaven, and spake a word aloud: “Father"
13342,BOOK XXIV.,"Zeus that bearest sway from Ida, most glorious and most great, grant"
13343,BOOK XXIV.,"that I find welcome and pity under Achilles’ roof, and send a bird of"
13344,BOOK XXIV.,"omen, even the swift messenger that is dearest of all birds to thee and"
13345,BOOK XXIV.,"of mightiest strength, to appear upon the right, that seeing this sign"
13346,BOOK XXIV.,with mine eyes I may go trusting therein unto the ships of the
13347,BOOK XXIV.,fleet-horsed Danaans.”
13348,BOOK XXIV.,
13349,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus spake he praying, and Zeus of wise counsels hearkened unto him,"
13350,BOOK XXIV.,"and straightway sent forth an eagle, surest omen of winged birds, the"
13351,BOOK XXIV.,"dusky hunter called of men the Black Eagle. Wide as the door, well"
13352,BOOK XXIV.,"locking, fitted close, of some rich man’s high-roofed hall, so wide"
13353,BOOK XXIV.,were his wings either way; and he appeared to them speeding on the
13354,BOOK XXIV.,right hand above the city. And when they saw the eagle they rejoiced
13355,BOOK XXIV.,and all their hearts were glad within their breasts.
13356,BOOK XXIV.,
13357,BOOK XXIV.,"Then the old man made haste to go up into his car, and drave forth from"
13358,BOOK XXIV.,the doorway and the echoing portico. In front the mules drew the
13359,BOOK XXIV.,"four-wheeled wain, and wise Idaios drave them; behind came the horses"
13360,BOOK XXIV.,which the old man urged with the lash at speed along the city: and his
13361,BOOK XXIV.,friends all followed lamenting loud as though he were faring to his
13362,BOOK XXIV.,death. And when they were come down from the city and were now on the
13363,BOOK XXIV.,"plain, then went back again to Ilios his sons and marriage kin. But the"
13364,BOOK XXIV.,two coming forth upon the plain were not unbeheld of far-seeing Zeus.
13365,BOOK XXIV.,"But he looked upon the old man and had compassion on him, and"
13366,BOOK XXIV.,"straightway spake unto Hermes his dear son: “Hermes, since unto thee"
13367,BOOK XXIV.,"especially is it dear to companion men, and thou hearest whomsoever"
13368,BOOK XXIV.,"thou wilt, go forth and so guide Priam to the hollow ships of the"
13369,BOOK XXIV.,"Achaians that no man behold or be aware of him, among all the Danaans’"
13370,BOOK XXIV.,"host, until he come to the son of Peleus.”"
13371,BOOK XXIV.,
13372,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus spake he, and the Messenger, the slayer of Argus, was not"
13373,BOOK XXIV.,disobedient unto his word. Straightway beneath his feet he bound on his
13374,BOOK XXIV.,"fair sandals, golden, divine, that bare him over wet sea and over the"
13375,BOOK XXIV.,boundless land with the breathings of the wind. And he took up his wand
13376,BOOK XXIV.,"wherewith he entranceth the eyes of such men as he will, and others he"
13377,BOOK XXIV.,likewise waketh out of sleep: this did the strong slayer of Argus take
13378,BOOK XXIV.,"in his hand, and flew. And quickly came he to Troy-land and the"
13379,BOOK XXIV.,"Hellespont, and went on his way in semblance as a young man that is a"
13380,BOOK XXIV.,"prince, with the new down on his chin, as when the youth of men is the"
13381,BOOK XXIV.,comeliest.
13382,BOOK XXIV.,
13383,BOOK XXIV.,"Now the others, when they had driven beyond the great barrow of Ilios,"
13384,BOOK XXIV.,halted the mules and horses at the river to drink; for darkness was
13385,BOOK XXIV.,"come down over the earth. Then the herald beheld Hermes from hard by,"
13386,BOOK XXIV.,"and marked him, and spake and said to Priam: “Consider, son of"
13387,BOOK XXIV.,"Dardanos; this is matter of prudent thought. I see a man, methinks we"
13388,BOOK XXIV.,"shall full soon be rent in pieces. Come, let us flee in our chariot, or"
13389,BOOK XXIV.,else at least touch his knees and entreat him that he have mercy on
13390,BOOK XXIV.,us.”
13391,BOOK XXIV.,
13392,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus spake he, and the old man was confounded, and he was dismayed"
13393,BOOK XXIV.,"exceedingly, and the hair on his pliant limbs stood up, and he stood"
13394,BOOK XXIV.,still amazed. But the Helper came nigh of himself and took the old
13395,BOOK XXIV.,"man’s hand, and spake and questioned him: “Whither, father, dost thou"
13396,BOOK XXIV.,"thus guide these horses and mules through the divine night, when other"
13397,BOOK XXIV.,mortals are asleep? Hadst thou no fear of the fierce-breathing
13398,BOOK XXIV.,"Achaians, thy bitter foes that are hard anigh thee? If one of them"
13399,BOOK XXIV.,"should espy thee carrying such treasures through the swift black night,"
13400,BOOK XXIV.,"what then would be thy thought? Neither art thou young thyself, and thy"
13401,BOOK XXIV.,"companion here is old, that ye should make defence against a man that"
13402,BOOK XXIV.,"should assail thee first. But I will no wise harm thee, yea I will keep"
13403,BOOK XXIV.,any other from thy hurt: for the similitude of my dear father I see in
13404,BOOK XXIV.,thee.”
13405,BOOK XXIV.,
13406,BOOK XXIV.,"And to him in answer spake the old man, godlike Priam: “Even so, kind"
13407,BOOK XXIV.,"son, are all these things as thou sayest. Nevertheless hath some god"
13408,BOOK XXIV.,stretched forth his hand even over me in that he hath sent a wayfarer
13409,BOOK XXIV.,"such as thou to meet me, a bearer of good luck, by the nobleness of thy"
13410,BOOK XXIV.,form and semblance; and thou art wise of heart and of blessed parents
13411,BOOK XXIV.,art thou sprung.”
13412,BOOK XXIV.,
13413,BOOK XXIV.,"And to him again spake the Messenger, the slayer of Argus: “All this,"
13414,BOOK XXIV.,"old sire, hast thou verily spoken aright. But come say this and tell me"
13415,BOOK XXIV.,truly whether thou art taking forth a great and goodly treasure unto
13416,BOOK XXIV.,"alien men, where it may abide for thee in safety, or whether by this ye"
13417,BOOK XXIV.,are all forsaking holy Ilios in fear; so far the best man among you
13418,BOOK XXIV.,"hath perished, even thy son; for of battle with the Achaians abated he"
13419,BOOK XXIV.,never a jot.”
13420,BOOK XXIV.,
13421,BOOK XXIV.,"And to him in answer spake the old man, godlike Priam, “Who art thou,"
13422,BOOK XXIV.,"noble sir, and of whom art born? For meetly hast thou spoken of the"
13423,BOOK XXIV.,fate of my hapless son.”
13424,BOOK XXIV.,
13425,BOOK XXIV.,"And to him again spake the Messenger, the slayer of Argus: “Thou art"
13426,BOOK XXIV.,"proving me, old sire, in asking me of noble Hector. Him have I full oft"
13427,BOOK XXIV.,"seen with mine eyes in glorious battle, and when at the ships he was"
13428,BOOK XXIV.,"slaying the Argives he drave thither, piercing them with the keen"
13429,BOOK XXIV.,"bronze, and we stood still and marvelled thereat, for Achilles suffered"
13430,BOOK XXIV.,"us not to fight, being wroth against Atreus’ son. His squire am I, and"
13431,BOOK XXIV.,"came in the same well-wrought ship. From the Myrmidons I come, and my"
13432,BOOK XXIV.,"father is Polyktor. Wealthy is he, and an old man even as thou, and six"
13433,BOOK XXIV.,"other sons hath he, and I am his seventh. With the others I cast lots,"
13434,BOOK XXIV.,and it fell to me to fare hither with the host. And now am I come from
13435,BOOK XXIV.,"the ships to the plain, for at day-break the glancing-eyed Achaians"
13436,BOOK XXIV.,will set the battle in array around the town. For it chafeth them to be
13437,BOOK XXIV.,"sitting here, nor can the Achaian lords hold in their fury for the"
13438,BOOK XXIV.,fray.”
13439,BOOK XXIV.,
13440,BOOK XXIV.,"And the old man, godlike Priam, answered him, saying: “If verily thou"
13441,BOOK XXIV.,"art a squire of Achilles Peleus’ son, come tell me all the truth,"
13442,BOOK XXIV.,"whether still my son is by the ships, or whether ere now Achilles hath"
13443,BOOK XXIV.,riven him limb from limb and cast him to the dogs.”
13444,BOOK XXIV.,
13445,BOOK XXIV.,"Then to him again spake the Messenger the slayer of Argus: “Old sire,"
13446,BOOK XXIV.,"not yet have dogs or birds devoured him, but there lieth he still by"
13447,BOOK XXIV.,"Achilles’ ship, even as he fell, among the huts, and the twelfth morn"
13448,BOOK XXIV.,"now hath risen upon him, nor doth his flesh corrupt at all, neither"
13449,BOOK XXIV.,"worms consume it, such as devour men slain in war. Truly Achilles"
13450,BOOK XXIV.,draggeth him recklessly around the barrow of his dear comrade so oft as
13451,BOOK XXIV.,"divine day dawneth, yet marreth he him not; thou wouldst marvel if thou"
13452,BOOK XXIV.,"couldst go see thyself how dewy fresh he lieth, and is washed clean of"
13453,BOOK XXIV.,"blood, nor anywhere defiled; and all his wounds wherewith he was"
13454,BOOK XXIV.,"stricken are closed; howbeit many of thy son, though he be but a dead"
13455,BOOK XXIV.,"corpse, for they held him dear at heart.”"
13456,BOOK XXIV.,
13457,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus spake he, and the old man rejoiced, and answered him, saying: “My"
13458,BOOK XXIV.,"son, it is verily a good thing to give due offerings withal to the"
13459,BOOK XXIV.,"Immortals, for never did my child—if that child indeed I had—forget in"
13460,BOOK XXIV.,our halls the gods who inhabit Olympus. Therefore have they remembered
13461,BOOK XXIV.,"this for him, albeit his portion is death. But come now take from me"
13462,BOOK XXIV.,"this goodly goblet, and guard me myself and guide me, under Heaven,"
13463,BOOK XXIV.,that I may come unto the hut of Peleus’ son.”
13464,BOOK XXIV.,
13465,BOOK XXIV.,Then spake unto him again the Messenger the slayer of Argus: “Thou art
13466,BOOK XXIV.,"proving me, old sire, who am younger than thou, but thou wilt not"
13467,BOOK XXIV.,"prevail upon me, in that thou biddest me take gifts from thee without"
13468,BOOK XXIV.,"Achilles’ privity. I were afraid and shamed at heart to defraud him,"
13469,BOOK XXIV.,lest some evil come to pass on me hereafter. But as thy guide I would
13470,BOOK XXIV.,"go even unto famous Argos, accompanying thee courteously in swift ship"
13471,BOOK XXIV.,or on foot. Not from scorn of thy guide would any assail thee then.”
13472,BOOK XXIV.,
13473,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus spake the Helper, and leaping on the chariot behind the horses he"
13474,BOOK XXIV.,"swiftly took lash and reins into his hand, and breathed brave spirit"
13475,BOOK XXIV.,into horses and mules. But when they were come to the towers and trench
13476,BOOK XXIV.,"of the ships, there were the sentinels just busying them about their"
13477,BOOK XXIV.,"supper. Then the Messenger, the slayer of Argus, shed sleep upon them"
13478,BOOK XXIV.,"all, and straightway opened the gates and thrust back the bars, and"
13479,BOOK XXIV.,brought within Priam and the splendid gifts upon his wain. And they
13480,BOOK XXIV.,"came to the lofty hut of the son of Peleus, which the Myrmidons made"
13481,BOOK XXIV.,"for their king and hewed therefor timber of the pine, and thatched it"
13482,BOOK XXIV.,"with downy thatching-rush that they mowed in the meadows, and around it"
13483,BOOK XXIV.,made for him their lord a great court with close-set palisades; and the
13484,BOOK XXIV.,door was barred by a single bolt of pine that three Achaians wont to
13485,BOOK XXIV.,"drive home, and three drew back that mighty bar—three of the rest, but"
13486,BOOK XXIV.,Achilles by himself would drive it home. Then opened the Helper Hermes
13487,BOOK XXIV.,"the door for the old man, and brought in the splendid gifts for Peleus’"
13488,BOOK XXIV.,"fleet-footed son, and descended from the chariot to the earth and spake"
13489,BOOK XXIV.,"aloud: “Old sire, I that have come to thee am an immortal god, even"
13490,BOOK XXIV.,"Hermes, for my father sent me to companion thee on thy way. But now"
13491,BOOK XXIV.,will I depart from thee nor come within Achilles’ sight; it were cause
13492,BOOK XXIV.,of wrath that an immortal god should thus show favour openly unto
13493,BOOK XXIV.,mortals. But thou go in and clasp the knees of Peleus’ son and entreat
13494,BOOK XXIV.,him for his father’s sake and his mother’s of the lovely hair and for
13495,BOOK XXIV.,his child’s sake that thou mayest move his soul.”
13496,BOOK XXIV.,
13497,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus Hermes spake, and departed unto high Olympus. But Priam leapt from"
13498,BOOK XXIV.,"the car to the earth, and left Idaios in his place; he stayed to mind"
13499,BOOK XXIV.,the horses and mules; but the old man made straight for the house where
13500,BOOK XXIV.,Achilles dear to Zeus was wont to sit. And therein he found the man
13501,BOOK XXIV.,"himself, and his comrades sate apart: two only, the hero Automedon and"
13502,BOOK XXIV.,"Alkimos, of the stock of Ares, were busy in attendance; and he was"
13503,BOOK XXIV.,"lately ceased from meat, even from eating and drinking: and still the"
13504,BOOK XXIV.,table stood beside him. But they were unaware of great Priam as he came
13505,BOOK XXIV.,"in, and so stood he anigh and clasped in his hands the knees of"
13506,BOOK XXIV.,"Achilles, and kissed his hands, terrible, man-slaying, that slew many"
13507,BOOK XXIV.,of Priam’s sons. And as when a grievous curse cometh upon a man who in
13508,BOOK XXIV.,"his own country hath slain another and escapeth to a land of strangers,"
13509,BOOK XXIV.,"to the house of some rich man, and wonder possesseth them that look on"
13510,BOOK XXIV.,"him—so Achilles wondered when he saw godlike Priam, and the rest"
13511,BOOK XXIV.,"wondered likewise, and looked upon one another. Then Priam spake and"
13512,BOOK XXIV.,"entreated him, saying: “Bethink thee, O Achilles like to gods, of thy"
13513,BOOK XXIV.,"father that is of like years with me, on the grievous pathway of old"
13514,BOOK XXIV.,"age. Him haply are the dwellers round about entreating evilly, nor is"
13515,BOOK XXIV.,there any to ward from him ruin and bane. Nevertheless while he heareth
13516,BOOK XXIV.,"of thee as yet alive he rejoiceth in his heart, and hopeth withal day"
13517,BOOK XXIV.,after day that he shall see his dear son returning from Troy-land. But
13518,BOOK XXIV.,"I, I am utterly unblest, since I begat sons the best men in wide"
13519,BOOK XXIV.,"Troy-land, but declare unto thee that none of them is left. Fifty I"
13520,BOOK XXIV.,"had, when the sons of the Achaians came; nineteen were born to me of"
13521,BOOK XXIV.,"one mother, and concubines bare the rest within my halls. Now of the"
13522,BOOK XXIV.,"more part had impetuous Ares unstrung the knees, and he who was yet"
13523,BOOK XXIV.,"left and guarded city and men, him slewest thou but now as he fought"
13524,BOOK XXIV.,"for his country, even Hector. For his sake come I unto the ships of the"
13525,BOOK XXIV.,"Achaians that I may win him back from thee, and I bring with me untold"
13526,BOOK XXIV.,"ransom. Yea, fear thou the gods, Achilles, and have compassion on me,"
13527,BOOK XXIV.,"even me, bethinking thee of thy father. Lo, I am yet more piteous than"
13528,BOOK XXIV.,"he, and have braved what none other man on earth hath braved before, to"
13529,BOOK XXIV.,stretch forth my hand toward the face of the slayer of my sons.”
13530,BOOK XXIV.,
13531,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus spake he, and stirred within Achilles desire to make lament for"
13532,BOOK XXIV.,his father. And he touched the old man’s hand and gently moved him
13533,BOOK XXIV.,"back. And as they both bethought them of their dead, so Priam for"
13534,BOOK XXIV.,"man-slaying Hector wept sore as he was fallen before Achilles’ feet,"
13535,BOOK XXIV.,"and Achilles wept for his own father, and now again for Patroklos, and"
13536,BOOK XXIV.,their moan went up throughout the house. But when noble Achilles had
13537,BOOK XXIV.,"satisfied him with lament, and the desire thereof departed from his"
13538,BOOK XXIV.,"heart and limbs, straightway he sprang from his seat and raised the old"
13539,BOOK XXIV.,"man by his hand, pitying his hoary head and hoary beard, and spake unto"
13540,BOOK XXIV.,him winged words and said: “Ah hapless! many ill things verily thou
13541,BOOK XXIV.,hast endured in thy heart. How durst thou come alone to the ships of
13542,BOOK XXIV.,the Achaians and to meet the eyes of the man who hath slain full many
13543,BOOK XXIV.,of the brave sons? of iron verily is thy heart. But come then set thee
13544,BOOK XXIV.,"on a seat, and we will let our sorrows lie quiet in our hearts for all"
13545,BOOK XXIV.,"our pain, for no avail cometh of chill lament. This is the lot the gods"
13546,BOOK XXIV.,"have spun for miserable men, that they should live in pain; yet"
13547,BOOK XXIV.,themselves are sorrowless. For two urns stand upon the floor of Zeus
13548,BOOK XXIV.,"filled with his evil gifts, and one with blessings. To whomsoever Zeus"
13549,BOOK XXIV.,"whose joy is in the lightning dealeth a mingled lot, that man chanceth"
13550,BOOK XXIV.,"now upon ill and now again on good, but to whom he giveth but of the"
13551,BOOK XXIV.,"bad kind him he bringeth to scorn, and evil famine chaseth him over the"
13552,BOOK XXIV.,"goodly earth, and he is a wanderer honoured of neither gods nor men."
13553,BOOK XXIV.,"Even thus to Peleus gave the gods splendid gifts from his birth, for he"
13554,BOOK XXIV.,"excelled all men in good fortune and wealth, and was king of the"
13555,BOOK XXIV.,"Myrmidons, and mortal though he was the gods gave him a goddess to be"
13556,BOOK XXIV.,"his bride. Yet even on him God brought evil, seeing that there arose to"
13557,BOOK XXIV.,"him no offspring of princely sons in his halls, save that he begat one"
13558,BOOK XXIV.,"son to an untimely death. Neither may I tend him as he groweth old,"
13559,BOOK XXIV.,"since very far from my country I am dwelling in Troy-land, to vex thee"
13560,BOOK XXIV.,"and thy children. And of thee, old sire, we have heard how of old time"
13561,BOOK XXIV.,"thou wert happy, even how of all that Lesbos, seat of Makar, boundeth"
13562,BOOK XXIV.,to the north thereof and Phrygia farther up and the vast Hellespont—of
13563,BOOK XXIV.,"all these folk, men say, thou wert the richest in wealth and in sons,"
13564,BOOK XXIV.,"but after that the Powers of Heaven brought this bane on thee, ever are"
13565,BOOK XXIV.,"battles and man-slayings around thy city. Keep courage, and lament not"
13566,BOOK XXIV.,unabatingly in thy heart. For nothing wilt thou avail by grieving for
13567,BOOK XXIV.,"thy son, neither shalt thou bring him back to life or ever some new"
13568,BOOK XXIV.,evil come upon thee.”
13569,BOOK XXIV.,
13570,BOOK XXIV.,"Then made answer unto him the old man, godlike Priam: “Bid me not to a"
13571,BOOK XXIV.,"seat, O fosterling of Zeus, so long as Hector lieth uncared for at the"
13572,BOOK XXIV.,"huts, but straightway give him back that I may behold him with mine"
13573,BOOK XXIV.,eyes; and accept thou the great ransom that we bring. So mayest thou
13574,BOOK XXIV.,"have pleasure thereof, and come unto thy native land, since thou hast"
13575,BOOK XXIV.,spared me from the first.”
13576,BOOK XXIV.,
13577,BOOK XXIV.,Then fleet-footed Achilles looked sternly upon him and said: “No longer
13578,BOOK XXIV.,"chafe me, old sire; of myself am I minded to give Hector back to thee,"
13579,BOOK XXIV.,"for there came to me a messenger from Zeus, even my mother who bare me,"
13580,BOOK XXIV.,"daughter of the Ancient One of the Sea. And I know, O Priam, in my"
13581,BOOK XXIV.,"mind, nor am unaware that some god it is that hath guided thee to the"
13582,BOOK XXIV.,"swift ships of the Achaians. For no mortal man, even though in prime of"
13583,BOOK XXIV.,"youth, would dare to come among the host, for neither could he escape"
13584,BOOK XXIV.,"the watch, nor easily thrust back the bolt of our doors. Therefore now"
13585,BOOK XXIV.,"stir my heart no more amid my troubles, lest I leave not even thee in"
13586,BOOK XXIV.,"peace, old sire, within my hut, albeit thou art my suppliant, and lest"
13587,BOOK XXIV.,I transgress the commandment of Zeus.”
13588,BOOK XXIV.,
13589,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus spake he, and the old man feared, and obeyed his word. And the son"
13590,BOOK XXIV.,"of Peleus leapt like a lion through the door of the house, not alone,"
13591,BOOK XXIV.,"for with him went two squires, the hero Automedon and Alkimos, they"
13592,BOOK XXIV.,"whom above all his comrades Achilles honoured, save only Patroklos that"
13593,BOOK XXIV.,"was dead. They then loosed from under the yoke the horses and mules,"
13594,BOOK XXIV.,"and led in the old man’s crier-herald and set him on a chair, and from"
13595,BOOK XXIV.,the wain of goodly felloes they took the countless ransom set on
13596,BOOK XXIV.,"Hector’s head. But they left two robes and a well-spun doublet, that"
13597,BOOK XXIV.,Achilles might wrap the dead therein when he gave him to be carried
13598,BOOK XXIV.,home. And he called forth handmaids and bade them wash and anoint him
13599,BOOK XXIV.,"when they had borne him apart, so that Priam should not look upon his"
13600,BOOK XXIV.,"son, lest he should not refrain the wrath at his sorrowing heart when"
13601,BOOK XXIV.,"he should look upon his son, and lest Achilles’ heart be vexed thereat"
13602,BOOK XXIV.,and he slay him and transgress the commandment of Zeus. So when the
13603,BOOK XXIV.,"handmaids had washed the body and anointed it with oil, and had thrown"
13604,BOOK XXIV.,"over it a fair robe and a doublet, then Achilles himself lifted it and"
13605,BOOK XXIV.,"laid it on a bier, and his comrades with him lifted it on to the"
13606,BOOK XXIV.,polished waggon. Then he groaned aloud and called on his dear comrade
13607,BOOK XXIV.,"by his name: “Patroklos, be not vexed with me if thou hear even in the"
13608,BOOK XXIV.,house of Hades that I have given back noble Hector unto his dear
13609,BOOK XXIV.,"father, for not unworthy is the ransom he hath given me, whereof I will"
13610,BOOK XXIV.,deal to thee again thy rightful share.”
13611,BOOK XXIV.,
13612,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus spake noble Achilles, and went back into the hut, and sate him"
13613,BOOK XXIV.,down on the cunningly-wrought couch whence he had arisen by the
13614,BOOK XXIV.,"opposite wall, and spake a word to Priam: “Thy son, old sire, is given"
13615,BOOK XXIV.,"back as thou wouldest and lieth on a bier, and with the break of day"
13616,BOOK XXIV.,thou shalt see him thyself as thou carriest him. But now bethink we us
13617,BOOK XXIV.,"of supper. For even fair-haired Niobe bethought her of meat, she whose"
13618,BOOK XXIV.,"twelve children perished in her halls, six daughters and six lusty"
13619,BOOK XXIV.,"sons. The sons Apollo, in his anger against Niobe, slew with arrows"
13620,BOOK XXIV.,"from his silver bow, and the daughters archer Artemis, for that Niobe"
13621,BOOK XXIV.,"matched herself against fair-cheeked Leto, saying that the goddess bare"
13622,BOOK XXIV.,but twain but herself many children: so they though they were but twain
13623,BOOK XXIV.,"destroyed the other all. Nine days they lay in their blood, nor was"
13624,BOOK XXIV.,"there any to bury them, for Kronion turned the folk to stones. Yet on"
13625,BOOK XXIV.,"the tenth day the gods of heaven buried them, and she then bethought"
13626,BOOK XXIV.,"her of meat, when she was wearied out with weeping tears. And somewhere"
13627,BOOK XXIV.,"now among the cliffs, on the lonely mountains, even on Sipylos, where"
13628,BOOK XXIV.,"they say are the couching-places of nymphs that dance around Acheloos,"
13629,BOOK XXIV.,"there she, albeit a stone, broodeth still over her troubles from the"
13630,BOOK XXIV.,"gods. But come let us too, noble father, take thought of meat, and"
13631,BOOK XXIV.,afterward thou shalt mourn over thy dear son as thou carriest him to
13632,BOOK XXIV.,Ilios; and many tears shall be his due.”
13633,BOOK XXIV.,
13634,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus spake fleet Achilles, and sprang up, and slew a pure white sheep,"
13635,BOOK XXIV.,"and his comrades skinned and made it ready in seemly fashion, and"
13636,BOOK XXIV.,"divided it cunningly and pierced it with spits, and roasted it"
13637,BOOK XXIV.,carefully and drew all off. And Automedon took bread and served it on a
13638,BOOK XXIV.,"table in fair baskets, while Achilles dealt out the flesh. And they"
13639,BOOK XXIV.,stretched forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them.
13640,BOOK XXIV.,"But when they had put off the desire of meat and drink, then Priam son"
13641,BOOK XXIV.,of Dardanos marvelled at Achilles to see how great he was and how
13642,BOOK XXIV.,"goodly, for he was like a god to look upon. And Achilles marvelled at"
13643,BOOK XXIV.,"Priam son of Dardanos, beholding his noble aspect and hearkening to his"
13644,BOOK XXIV.,"words. But when they had gazed their fill upon one another, then first"
13645,BOOK XXIV.,"spake the old man, godlike Priam, to Achilles: “Now presently give me"
13646,BOOK XXIV.,"whereon to lie, fosterling of Zeus, that of sweet sleep also we may now"
13647,BOOK XXIV.,take our fill at rest: for never yet have mine eyes closed beneath
13648,BOOK XXIV.,"their lids since at thy hands my son lost his life, but I continually"
13649,BOOK XXIV.,"mourn and brood over countless griefs, grovelling in the"
13650,BOOK XXIV.,courtyard-close amid the mire. Now at last have I tasted bread and
13651,BOOK XXIV.,"poured bright wine down my throat, but till now I had tasted naught.”"
13652,BOOK XXIV.,
13653,BOOK XXIV.,"He said, and Achilles bade his comrades and handmaids to set a bedstead"
13654,BOOK XXIV.,"beneath the portico, and to cast thereon fair shining rugs and spread"
13655,BOOK XXIV.,coverlets above and thereon to lay thick mantles to be a clothing over
13656,BOOK XXIV.,all. And the maids went forth from the inner hail with torches in their
13657,BOOK XXIV.,"hands, and quickly spread two beds in haste. Then with bitter meaning"
13658,BOOK XXIV.,[in his reference to Agamemnon] said fleet-footed Achilles unto Priam:
13659,BOOK XXIV.,"“Lie thou without, dear sire, lest there come hither one of the"
13660,BOOK XXIV.,"counsellors of the Achaians, such as ever take counsel with me by my"
13661,BOOK XXIV.,"side, as custom is. If any of such should behold thee through the swift"
13662,BOOK XXIV.,"black night, forthwith he might haply tell it to Agamemnon shepherd of"
13663,BOOK XXIV.,"the host, and thus would there be delay in giving back the dead. But"
13664,BOOK XXIV.,"come say this to me and tell it true, how many days’ space thou art"
13665,BOOK XXIV.,"fain to make funeral for noble Hector, so that for so long I may myself"
13666,BOOK XXIV.,abide and may keep back the host.”
13667,BOOK XXIV.,
13668,BOOK XXIV.,"And the old man, godlike Priam, answered him, saying: “If thou art"
13669,BOOK XXIV.,"verily willing that I accomplish noble Hector’s funeral, by doing as"
13670,BOOK XXIV.,"thou sayest, O Achilles, thou wilt do me grace. For thou knowest how we"
13671,BOOK XXIV.,"are pent within the city, and wood from the mountain is far to fetch,"
13672,BOOK XXIV.,and the Trojans are much in fear. Nine days will we make moan for him
13673,BOOK XXIV.,"in our halls, and on the tenth we will hold funeral and the folk shall"
13674,BOOK XXIV.,"feast, and on the eleventh we will make, a barrow over him, and on the"
13675,BOOK XXIV.,twelfth we will do battle if need be.”
13676,BOOK XXIV.,
13677,BOOK XXIV.,"Then again spake the fleet noble Achilles unto him, saying: “All this,"
13678,BOOK XXIV.,"O ancient Priam, shall be as thou biddest; for I will hold back the"
13679,BOOK XXIV.,battle even so long a time as thou tellest me.”
13680,BOOK XXIV.,
13681,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus speaking he clasped the old man’s right hand at the wrist, lest he"
13682,BOOK XXIV.,should be anywise afraid at heart. So they in the forepart of the house
13683,BOOK XXIV.,"laid them down, Priam and the herald, with wise thoughts at their"
13684,BOOK XXIV.,"hearts, but Achilles slept in a recess of the firm-wrought hut, and"
13685,BOOK XXIV.,beside him lay fair-cheeked Briseis.
13686,BOOK XXIV.,
13687,BOOK XXIV.,"Now all other gods and warriors lords of chariots slumbered all night,"
13688,BOOK XXIV.,by soft sleep overcome. But not on the Helper Hermes did sleep take
13689,BOOK XXIV.,hold as he sought within his heart how he should guide forth king Priam
13690,BOOK XXIV.,from the ships unespied of the trusty sentinels. And he stood above his
13691,BOOK XXIV.,"head and spake a word to him: “Old sire, no thought then hast thou of"
13692,BOOK XXIV.,"any evil, seeing thou yet sleepest among men that are thine enemies,"
13693,BOOK XXIV.,for that Achilles spared thee. Truly now hast thou won back thy dear
13694,BOOK XXIV.,"son, and at great price. But for thy life will thy sons thou hast left"
13695,BOOK XXIV.,"behind be offering threefold ransom, if but Agamemnon Atreus’ son be"
13696,BOOK XXIV.,"aware of thee, and aware be all the Achaians.”"
13697,BOOK XXIV.,
13698,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus spake he, and the old man feared, and roused the herald. And"
13699,BOOK XXIV.,"Hermes yoked the horses and mules for them, and himself drave them"
13700,BOOK XXIV.,"lightly through the camp, and none was aware of them."
13701,BOOK XXIV.,
13702,BOOK XXIV.,"But when they came to the ford of the fair-flowing river, [even eddying"
13703,BOOK XXIV.,"Xanthos, begotten of immortal Zeus,] then Hermes departed up to high"
13704,BOOK XXIV.,"Olympus, and Morning of the saffron robe spread over all the earth. And"
13705,BOOK XXIV.,"they with wail and moan drave the horses to the city, and the mules"
13706,BOOK XXIV.,drew the dead. Nor marked them any man or fair-girdled woman until
13707,BOOK XXIV.,"Kassandra, peer of golden Aphrodite, having gone up upon Pergamos, was"
13708,BOOK XXIV.,"aware of her dear father as he stood in the car, and the herald that"
13709,BOOK XXIV.,was crier to the town. Then beheld she him that lay upon the bier
13710,BOOK XXIV.,"behind the mules, and thereat she wailed and cried aloud throughout all"
13711,BOOK XXIV.,"the town: “O men and women of Troy, come ye hither and look upon"
13712,BOOK XXIV.,"Hector, if ever while he was alive ye rejoiced when he came back from"
13713,BOOK XXIV.,"battle, since great joy was he to the city and all the folk.”"
13714,BOOK XXIV.,
13715,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus spake she, nor was man or woman left within the city, for upon all"
13716,BOOK XXIV.,came unendurable grief. And near the gates they met Priam bringing home
13717,BOOK XXIV.,"the dead. First bewailed him his dear wife and lady mother, as they"
13718,BOOK XXIV.,cast them on the fair-wheeled wain and touched his head; and around
13719,BOOK XXIV.,them stood the throng and wept. So all day long unto the setting of the
13720,BOOK XXIV.,"sun they had lamented Hector in tears without the gate, had not the old"
13721,BOOK XXIV.,man spoken from the car among the folk: “Give me place for the mules to
13722,BOOK XXIV.,"pass through; hereafter ye shall have your fill of wailing, when I have"
13723,BOOK XXIV.,brought him unto his home.”
13724,BOOK XXIV.,
13725,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus spake he, and they parted asunder and gave place to the wain. And"
13726,BOOK XXIV.,"the others when they had brought him to the famous house, laid him on a"
13727,BOOK XXIV.,"fretted bed, and set beside him minstrel leaders of the dirge, who"
13728,BOOK XXIV.,"wailed a mournful lay, while the women made moan with them. And among"
13729,BOOK XXIV.,"the women white-armed Andromache led the lamentation, while in her"
13730,BOOK XXIV.,"hands she held the head of Hector slayer of men: “Husband, thou art"
13731,BOOK XXIV.,"gone young from life, and leavest me a widow in thy halls. And the"
13732,BOOK XXIV.,"child is yet but a little one, child of ill-fated parents, thee and me;"
13733,BOOK XXIV.,"nor methinks shall he grow up to manhood, for ere then shall this city"
13734,BOOK XXIV.,be utterly destroyed. For thou art verily perished who didst watch over
13735,BOOK XXIV.,"it, who guardedst it and keptest safe its noble wives and infant little"
13736,BOOK XXIV.,"ones. These soon shall be voyaging in the hollow ships, yea and I too"
13737,BOOK XXIV.,"with them, and thou, my child, shalt either go with me unto a place"
13738,BOOK XXIV.,"where thou shalt toil at unseemly tasks, labouring before the face of"
13739,BOOK XXIV.,"some harsh lord, or else some Achaian will take thee by the arm and"
13740,BOOK XXIV.,"hurl thee from the battlement, a grievous death, for that he is wroth"
13741,BOOK XXIV.,"because Hector slew his brother or father or son, since full many of"
13742,BOOK XXIV.,the Achaians in Hector’s hands have bitten the firm earth. For no light
13743,BOOK XXIV.,hand had thy father in the grievous fray. Therefore the folk lament him
13744,BOOK XXIV.,"throughout the city, and woe unspeakable and mourning hast thou left to"
13745,BOOK XXIV.,"thy parents, Hector, but with me chiefliest shall grievous pain abide."
13746,BOOK XXIV.,"For neither didst thou stretch thy hands to me from a bed in thy death,"
13747,BOOK XXIV.,neither didst speak to me some memorable word that I might have thought
13748,BOOK XXIV.,on evermore as my tears fall night and day.”
13749,BOOK XXIV.,
13750,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus spake she wailing, and the women joined their moan. And among them"
13751,BOOK XXIV.,"Hekabe again led the loud lament: “Hector, of all my children far"
13752,BOOK XXIV.,"dearest to my heart, verily while thou wert alive dear wert thou to the"
13753,BOOK XXIV.,"gods, and even in thy doom of death have they had care for thee. For"
13754,BOOK XXIV.,other sons of mine whom he took captive would fleet Achilles sell
13755,BOOK XXIV.,"beyond the unvintaged sea unto Samos and Imbros and smoking Lemnos, but"
13756,BOOK XXIV.,when with keen-edged bronze he had bereft thee of thy life he was fain
13757,BOOK XXIV.,"to drag thee oft around the tomb of his comrade, even Patroklos whom"
13758,BOOK XXIV.,"thou slewest, yet might he not raise him up thereby. But now all dewy"
13759,BOOK XXIV.,"and fresh thou liest in our halls, like one on whom Apollo, lord of the"
13760,BOOK XXIV.,"silver bow, hath descended and slain him with his gentle darts.”"
13761,BOOK XXIV.,
13762,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus spake she wailing, and stirred unending moan. Then thirdly Helen"
13763,BOOK XXIV.,"led their sore lament: “Hector, of all my brethren of Troy far dearest"
13764,BOOK XXIV.,to my heart! Truly my lord is godlike Alexandros who brought me to
13765,BOOK XXIV.,Troy-land—would I had died ere then. For this is now the twentieth year
13766,BOOK XXIV.,"since I went thence and am gone from my own native land, but never yet"
13767,BOOK XXIV.,"heard I evil or despiteful word from thee; nay, if any other haply"
13768,BOOK XXIV.,"upbraided me in the palace-halls, whether brother or sister of thine or"
13769,BOOK XXIV.,"brother’s fair-robed wife, or thy mother—but thy father is ever kind to"
13770,BOOK XXIV.,me as he were my own—then wouldst thou soothe such with words and
13771,BOOK XXIV.,"refrain them, by the gentleness of thy spirit and by thy gentle words."
13772,BOOK XXIV.,"Therefore bewail I thee with pain at heart, and my hapless self with"
13773,BOOK XXIV.,"thee, for no more is any left in wide Troy-land to be my friend and"
13774,BOOK XXIV.,"kind to me, but all men shudder at me.”"
13775,BOOK XXIV.,
13776,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus spake she wailing, and therewith the great multitude of the people"
13777,BOOK XXIV.,groaned. But the old man Priam spake a word among the folk: “Bring
13778,BOOK XXIV.,"wood, men of Troy, unto the city, and be not anywise afraid at heart of"
13779,BOOK XXIV.,a crafty ambush of the Achaians; for this message Achilles gave me when
13780,BOOK XXIV.,"he sent me from the black ships, that they should do us no hurt until"
13781,BOOK XXIV.,the twelfth morn arise.”
13782,BOOK XXIV.,
13783,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus spake he, and they yoked oxen and mules to wains, and quickly then"
13784,BOOK XXIV.,they flocked before the city. So nine days they gathered great store of
13785,BOOK XXIV.,"wood. But when the tenth morn rose with light for men, then bare they"
13786,BOOK XXIV.,"forth brave Hector, weeping tears, and on a lofty pyre they laid the"
13787,BOOK XXIV.,"dead man, and thereon cast fire."
13788,BOOK XXIV.,
13789,BOOK XXIV.,"But when the daughter of Dawn, rosy-fingered Morning, shone forth, then"
13790,BOOK XXIV.,gathered the folk around glorious Hector’s pyre. First quenched they
13791,BOOK XXIV.,"with bright wine all the burning, so far as the fire’s strength went,"
13792,BOOK XXIV.,"and then his brethren and comrades gathered his white bones lamenting,"
13793,BOOK XXIV.,and big tears flowed down their cheeks. And the bones they took and
