34,CANTO XV,
35,CANTO XV,"True love, that ever shows itself as clear"
36,CANTO XV,"In kindness, as loose appetite in wrong,"
37,CANTO XV,"Silenced that lyre harmonious, and still'd"
38,CANTO XV,"The sacred chords, that are by heav'n's right hand"
39,CANTO XV,"Unwound and tighten'd, flow to righteous prayers"
40,CANTO XV,"Should they not hearken, who, to give me will"
41,CANTO XV,"For praying, in accordance thus were mute?"
42,CANTO XV,"He hath in sooth good cause for endless grief,"
43,CANTO XV,"Who, for the love of thing that lasteth not,"
44,CANTO XV,Despoils himself forever of that love.
45,CANTO XV,
46,CANTO XV,"As oft along the still and pure serene,"
47,CANTO XV,"At nightfall, glides a sudden trail of fire,"
48,CANTO XV,Attracting with involuntary heed
49,CANTO XV,"The eye to follow it, erewhile at rest,"
50,CANTO XV,"And seems some star that shifted place in heav'n,"
51,CANTO XV,"Only that, whence it kindles, none is lost,"
52,CANTO XV,"And it is soon extinct; thus from the horn,"
53,CANTO XV,"That on the dexter of the cross extends,"
54,CANTO XV,"Down to its foot, one luminary ran"
55,CANTO XV,From mid the cluster shone there; yet no gem
56,CANTO XV,Dropp'd from its foil; and through the beamy list
57,CANTO XV,"Like flame in alabaster, glow'd its course."
58,CANTO XV,
59,CANTO XV,So forward stretch'd him (if of credence aught
60,CANTO XV,Our greater muse may claim) the pious ghost
61,CANTO XV,"Of old Anchises, in the' Elysian bower,"
62,CANTO XV,"When he perceiv'd his son.  ""O thou, my blood!"
63,CANTO XV,"O most exceeding grace divine! to whom,"
64,CANTO XV,"As now to thee, hath twice the heav'nly gate"
65,CANTO XV,"Been e'er unclos'd?"" so spake the light; whence I"
66,CANTO XV,Turn'd me toward him; then unto my dame
67,CANTO XV,"My sight directed, and on either side"
68,CANTO XV,Amazement waited me; for in her eyes
69,CANTO XV,"Was lighted such a smile, I thought that mine"
70,CANTO XV,Had div'd unto the bottom of my grace
71,CANTO XV,And of my bliss in Paradise.  Forthwith
72,CANTO XV,"To hearing and to sight grateful alike,"
73,CANTO XV,The spirit to his proem added things
74,CANTO XV,"I understood not, so profound he spake;"
75,CANTO XV,Yet not of choice but through necessity
76,CANTO XV,Mysterious; for his high conception scar'd
77,CANTO XV,Beyond the mark of mortals.  When the flight
78,CANTO XV,"Of holy transport had so spent its rage,"
79,CANTO XV,That nearer to the level of our thought
80,CANTO XV,"The speech descended, the first sounds I heard"
81,CANTO XV,"Were, ""Best he thou, Triunal Deity!"
82,CANTO XV,"That hast such favour in my seed vouchsaf'd!"""
83,CANTO XV,"Then follow'd: ""No unpleasant thirst, tho' long,"
84,CANTO XV,"Which took me reading in the sacred book,"
85,CANTO XV,"Whose leaves or white or dusky never change,"
86,CANTO XV,"Thou hast allay'd, my son, within this light,"
87,CANTO XV,From whence my voice thou hear'st; more thanks to her.
88,CANTO XV,Who for such lofty mounting has with plumes
89,CANTO XV,Begirt thee.  Thou dost deem thy thoughts to me
90,CANTO XV,"From him transmitted, who is first of all,"
91,CANTO XV,E'en as all numbers ray from unity;
92,CANTO XV,"And therefore dost not ask me who I am,"
93,CANTO XV,"Or why to thee more joyous I appear,"
94,CANTO XV,Than any other in this gladsome throng.
95,CANTO XV,The truth is as thou deem'st; for in this hue
96,CANTO XV,"Both less and greater in that mirror look,"
97,CANTO XV,"In which thy thoughts, or ere thou think'st, are shown."
98,CANTO XV,"But, that the love, which keeps me wakeful ever,"
99,CANTO XV,"Urging with sacred thirst of sweet desire,"
100,CANTO XV,"May be contended fully, let thy voice,"
101,CANTO XV,"Fearless, and frank and jocund, utter forth"
102,CANTO XV,"Thy will distinctly, utter forth the wish,"
103,CANTO XV,"Whereto my ready answer stands decreed."""
104,CANTO XV,
105,CANTO XV,I turn'd me to Beatrice; and she heard
106,CANTO XV,"Ere I had spoken, smiling, an assent,"
107,CANTO XV,That to my will gave wings; and I began
108,CANTO XV,"""To each among your tribe, what time ye kenn'd"
109,CANTO XV,"The nature, in whom naught unequal dwells,"
110,CANTO XV,Wisdom and love were in one measure dealt;
111,CANTO XV,"For that they are so equal in the sun,"
112,CANTO XV,"From whence ye drew your radiance and your heat,"
113,CANTO XV,"As makes all likeness scant.  But will and means,"
114,CANTO XV,"In mortals, for the cause ye well discern,"
115,CANTO XV,With unlike wings are fledge.  A mortal I
116,CANTO XV,"Experience inequality like this,"
117,CANTO XV,"And therefore give no thanks, but in the heart,"
118,CANTO XV,For thy paternal greeting.  This howe'er
119,CANTO XV,"I pray thee, living topaz! that ingemm'st"
120,CANTO XV,"This precious jewel, let me hear thy name."""
121,CANTO XV,
122,CANTO XV,"""I am thy root, O leaf! whom to expect"
123,CANTO XV,"Even, hath pleas'd me:"" thus the prompt reply"
124,CANTO XV,"Prefacing, next it added; ""he, of whom"
125,CANTO XV,"Thy kindred appellation comes, and who,"
126,CANTO XV,"These hundred years and more, on its first ledge"
127,CANTO XV,"Hath circuited the mountain, was my son"
128,CANTO XV,"And thy great grandsire.  Well befits, his long"
129,CANTO XV,Endurance should be shorten'd by thy deeds.
130,CANTO XV,
131,CANTO XV,"""Florence, within her ancient limit-mark,"
132,CANTO XV,"Which calls her still to matin prayers and noon,"
133,CANTO XV,"Was chaste and sober, and abode in peace."
134,CANTO XV,"She had no armlets and no head-tires then,"
135,CANTO XV,"No purfled dames, no zone, that caught the eye"
136,CANTO XV,"More than the person did.  Time was not yet,"
137,CANTO XV,When at his daughter's birth the sire grew pale.
138,CANTO XV,For fear the age and dowry should exceed
139,CANTO XV,On each side just proportion.  House was none
140,CANTO XV,Void of its family; nor yet had come
141,CANTO XV,"Hardanapalus, to exhibit feats"
142,CANTO XV,Of chamber prowess.  Montemalo yet
143,CANTO XV,O'er our suburban turret rose; as much
144,CANTO XV,"To be surpass in fall, as in its rising."
145,CANTO XV,I saw Bellincione Berti walk abroad
146,CANTO XV,In leathern girdle and a clasp of bone;
147,CANTO XV,"And, with no artful colouring on her cheeks,"
148,CANTO XV,His lady leave the glass.  The sons I saw
149,CANTO XV,Of Nerli and of Vecchio well content
150,CANTO XV,With unrob'd jerkin; and their good dames handling
151,CANTO XV,The spindle and the flax; O happy they!
152,CANTO XV,"Each sure of burial in her native land,"
153,CANTO XV,And none left desolate a-bed for France!
154,CANTO XV,"One wak'd to tend the cradle, hushing it"
155,CANTO XV,With sounds that lull'd the parent's infancy:
156,CANTO XV,"Another, with her maidens, drawing off"
157,CANTO XV,"The tresses from the distaff, lectur'd them"
158,CANTO XV,Old tales of Troy and Fesole and Rome.
159,CANTO XV,A Salterello and Cianghella we
160,CANTO XV,"Had held as strange a marvel, as ye would"
161,CANTO XV,A Cincinnatus or Cornelia now.
162,CANTO XV,
163,CANTO XV,"""In such compos'd and seemly fellowship,"
164,CANTO XV,"Such faithful and such fair equality,"
165,CANTO XV,"In so sweet household, Mary at my birth"
166,CANTO XV,"Bestow'd me, call'd on with loud cries; and there"
167,CANTO XV,"In your old baptistery, I was made"
168,CANTO XV,Christian at once and Cacciaguida; as were
169,CANTO XV,"My brethren, Eliseo and Moronto."
170,CANTO XV,
171,CANTO XV,"""From Valdipado came to me my spouse,"
172,CANTO XV,And hence thy surname grew.  I follow'd then
173,CANTO XV,The Emperor Conrad; and his knighthood he
174,CANTO XV,Did gird on me; in such good part he took
175,CANTO XV,My valiant service.  After him I went
176,CANTO XV,"To testify against that evil law,"
177,CANTO XV,"Whose people, by the shepherd's fault, possess"
178,CANTO XV,"Your right, usurping.  There, by that foul crew"
179,CANTO XV,"Was I releas'd from the deceitful world,"
180,CANTO XV,"Whose base affection many a spirit soils,"
181,CANTO XV,"And from the martyrdom came to this peace."""
182,CANTO XV,
183,CANTO XV,
184,CANTO XV,
185,CANTO XV,
186,CANTO XVI,CANTO XVI
187,CANTO XVI,
188,CANTO XVI,O slight respect of man's nobility!
189,CANTO XVI,"I never shall account it marvelous,"
190,CANTO XVI,That our infirm affection here below
191,CANTO XVI,"Thou mov'st to boasting, when I could not choose,"
192,CANTO XVI,"E'en in that region of unwarp'd desire,"
193,CANTO XVI,"In heav'n itself, but make my vaunt in thee!"
194,CANTO XVI,"Yet cloak thou art soon shorten'd, for that time,"
195,CANTO XVI,"Unless thou be eked out from day to day,"
196,CANTO XVI,Goes round thee with his shears.  Resuming then
197,CANTO XVI,"With greeting such, as Rome, was first to bear,"
198,CANTO XVI,But since hath disaccustom'd I began;
199,CANTO XVI,"And Beatrice, that a little space"
200,CANTO XVI,"Was sever'd, smil'd reminding me of her,"
201,CANTO XVI,Whose cough embolden'd (as the story holds)
202,CANTO XVI,To first offence the doubting Guenever.
203,CANTO XVI,
204,CANTO XVI,"""You are my sire,"" said I, ""you give me heart"
205,CANTO XVI,Freely to speak my thought: above myself
206,CANTO XVI,You raise me.  Through so many streams with joy
207,CANTO XVI,"My soul is fill'd, that gladness wells from it;"
208,CANTO XVI,"So that it bears the mighty tide, and bursts not"
209,CANTO XVI,"Say then, my honour'd stem! what ancestors"
210,CANTO XVI,"Where those you sprang from, and what years were mark'd"
211,CANTO XVI,"In your first childhood?  Tell me of the fold,"
212,CANTO XVI,"That hath Saint John for guardian, what was then"
213,CANTO XVI,"Its state, and who in it were highest seated?"""
214,CANTO XVI,
215,CANTO XVI,"As embers, at the breathing of the wind,"
216,CANTO XVI,"Their flame enliven, so that light I saw"
217,CANTO XVI,"Shine at my blandishments; and, as it grew"
218,CANTO XVI,"More fair to look on, so with voice more sweet,"
219,CANTO XVI,"Yet not in this our modern phrase, forthwith"
220,CANTO XVI,"It answer'd: ""From the day, when it was said"
221,CANTO XVI,"'Hail Virgin!' to the throes, by which my mother,"
222,CANTO XVI,"Who now is sainted, lighten'd her of me"
223,CANTO XVI,"Whom she was heavy with, this fire had come,"
224,CANTO XVI,"Five hundred fifty times and thrice, its beams"
225,CANTO XVI,To reilumine underneath the foot
226,CANTO XVI,"Of its own lion.  They, of whom I sprang,"
227,CANTO XVI,"And I, had there our birth-place, where the last"
228,CANTO XVI,Partition of our city first is reach'd
229,CANTO XVI,"By him, that runs her annual game.  Thus much"
230,CANTO XVI,"Suffice of my forefathers: who they were,"
231,CANTO XVI,"And whence they hither came, more honourable"
232,CANTO XVI,It is to pass in silence than to tell.
233,CANTO XVI,"All those, who in that time were there from Mars"
234,CANTO XVI,"Until the Baptist, fit to carry arms,"
235,CANTO XVI,Were but the fifth of them this day alive.
236,CANTO XVI,"But then the citizen's blood, that now is mix'd"
237,CANTO XVI,"From Campi and Certaldo and Fighine,"
238,CANTO XVI,Ran purely through the last mechanic's veins.
239,CANTO XVI,"O how much better were it, that these people"
240,CANTO XVI,"Were neighbours to you, and that at Galluzzo"
241,CANTO XVI,"And at Trespiano, ye should have your bound'ry,"
242,CANTO XVI,"Than to have them within, and bear the stench"
243,CANTO XVI,"Of Aguglione's hind, and Signa's, him,"
244,CANTO XVI,That hath his eye already keen for bart'ring!
245,CANTO XVI,"Had not the people, which of all the world"
246,CANTO XVI,"Degenerates most, been stepdame unto Caesar,"
247,CANTO XVI,"But, as a mother, gracious to her son;"
248,CANTO XVI,"Such one, as hath become a Florentine,"
249,CANTO XVI,"And trades and traffics, had been turn'd adrift"
250,CANTO XVI,"To Simifonte, where his grandsire ply'd"
251,CANTO XVI,The beggar's craft.  The Conti were possess'd
252,CANTO XVI,Of Montemurlo still: the Cerchi still
253,CANTO XVI,Were in Acone's parish; nor had haply
254,CANTO XVI,From Valdigrieve past the Buondelmonte.
255,CANTO XVI,The city's malady hath ever source
256,CANTO XVI,"In the confusion of its persons, as"
257,CANTO XVI,"The body's, in variety of food:"
258,CANTO XVI,"And the blind bull falls with a steeper plunge,"
259,CANTO XVI,Than the blind lamb; and oftentimes one sword
260,CANTO XVI,"Doth more and better execution,"
261,CANTO XVI,"Than five.  Mark Luni, Urbisaglia mark,"
262,CANTO XVI,"How they are gone, and after them how go"
263,CANTO XVI,Chiusi and Sinigaglia; and 't will seem
264,CANTO XVI,"No longer new or strange to thee to hear,"
265,CANTO XVI,"That families fail, when cities have their end."
266,CANTO XVI,"All things, that appertain t' ye, like yourselves,"
267,CANTO XVI,Are mortal: but mortality in some
268,CANTO XVI,"Ye mark not, they endure so long, and you"
269,CANTO XVI,Pass by so suddenly.  And as the moon
270,CANTO XVI,"Doth, by the rolling of her heav'nly sphere,"
271,CANTO XVI,Hide and reveal the strand unceasingly;
272,CANTO XVI,So fortune deals with Florence.  Hence admire not
273,CANTO XVI,"At what of them I tell thee, whose renown"
274,CANTO XVI,"Time covers, the first Florentines.  I saw"
275,CANTO XVI,"The Ughi, Catilini and Filippi,"
276,CANTO XVI,"The Alberichi, Greci and Ormanni,"
277,CANTO XVI,"Now in their wane, illustrious citizens:"
278,CANTO XVI,"And great as ancient, of Sannella him,"
279,CANTO XVI,"With him of Arca saw, and Soldanieri"
280,CANTO XVI,"And Ardinghi, and Bostichi.  At the poop,"
281,CANTO XVI,"That now is laden with new felony,"
282,CANTO XVI,"So cumb'rous it may speedily sink the bark,"
283,CANTO XVI,"The Ravignani sat, of whom is sprung"
284,CANTO XVI,"The County Guido, and whoso hath since"
285,CANTO XVI,His title from the fam'd Bellincione ta'en.
286,CANTO XVI,Fair governance was yet an art well priz'd
287,CANTO XVI,By him of Pressa: Galigaio show'd
288,CANTO XVI,"The gilded hilt and pommel, in his house."
289,CANTO XVI,"The column, cloth'd with verrey, still was seen"
290,CANTO XVI,"Unshaken: the Sacchetti still were great,"
291,CANTO XVI,"Giouchi, Sifanti, Galli and Barucci,"
292,CANTO XVI,With them who blush to hear the bushel nam'd.
293,CANTO XVI,Of the Calfucci still the branchy trunk
294,CANTO XVI,Was in its strength: and to the curule chairs
295,CANTO XVI,Sizii and Arigucci yet were drawn.
296,CANTO XVI,"How mighty them I saw, whom since their pride"
297,CANTO XVI,Hath undone! and in all her goodly deeds
298,CANTO XVI,Florence was by the bullets of bright gold
299,CANTO XVI,"O'erflourish'd.  Such the sires of those, who now,"
300,CANTO XVI,"As surely as your church is vacant, flock"
301,CANTO XVI,"Into her consistory, and at leisure"
302,CANTO XVI,"There stall them and grow fat.  The o'erweening brood,"
303,CANTO XVI,"That plays the dragon after him that flees,"
304,CANTO XVI,"But unto such, as turn and show the tooth,"
305,CANTO XVI,"Ay or the purse, is gentle as a lamb,"
306,CANTO XVI,"Was on its rise, but yet so slight esteem'd,"
307,CANTO XVI,That Ubertino of Donati grudg'd
308,CANTO XVI,His father-in-law should yoke him to its tribe.
309,CANTO XVI,Already Caponsacco had descended
310,CANTO XVI,Into the mart from Fesole: and Giuda
311,CANTO XVI,And Infangato were good citizens.
312,CANTO XVI,"A thing incredible I tell, tho' true:"
313,CANTO XVI,"The gateway, named from those of Pera, led"
314,CANTO XVI,Into the narrow circuit of your walls.
315,CANTO XVI,"Each one, who bears the sightly quarterings"
316,CANTO XVI,Of the great Baron (he whose name and worth
317,CANTO XVI,The festival of Thomas still revives)
318,CANTO XVI,His knighthood and his privilege retain'd;
319,CANTO XVI,"Albeit one, who borders them With gold,"
320,CANTO XVI,This day is mingled with the common herd.
321,CANTO XVI,"In Borgo yet the Gualterotti dwelt,"
322,CANTO XVI,And Importuni: well for its repose
323,CANTO XVI,Had it still lack'd of newer neighbourhood.
324,CANTO XVI,"The house, from whence your tears have had their spring,"
325,CANTO XVI,Through the just anger that hath murder'd ye
326,CANTO XVI,"And put a period to your gladsome days,"
327,CANTO XVI,"Was honour'd, it, and those consorted with it."
328,CANTO XVI,O Buondelmonte! what ill counseling
329,CANTO XVI,Prevail'd on thee to break the plighted bond
330,CANTO XVI,"Many, who now are weeping, would rejoice,"
331,CANTO XVI,"Had God to Ema giv'n thee, the first time"
332,CANTO XVI,Thou near our city cam'st.  But so was doom'd:
333,CANTO XVI,"On that maim'd stone set up to guard the bridge,"
334,CANTO XVI,"At thy last peace, the victim, Florence! fell."
335,CANTO XVI,"With these and others like to them, I saw"
336,CANTO XVI,"Florence in such assur'd tranquility,"
337,CANTO XVI,She had no cause at which to grieve: with these
338,CANTO XVI,"Saw her so glorious and so just, that ne'er"
339,CANTO XVI,"The lily from the lance had hung reverse,"
340,CANTO XVI,"Or through division been with vermeil dyed."""
341,CANTO XVI,
342,CANTO XVI,
343,CANTO XVI,
344,CANTO XVI,
345,CANTO XVII,CANTO XVII
346,CANTO XVII,
347,CANTO XVII,"Such as the youth, who came to Clymene"
348,CANTO XVII,"To certify himself of that reproach,"
349,CANTO XVII,"Which had been fasten'd on him, (he whose end"
350,CANTO XVII,"Still makes the fathers chary to their sons),"
351,CANTO XVII,E'en such was I; nor unobserv'd was such
352,CANTO XVII,"Of Beatrice, and that saintly lamp,"
353,CANTO XVII,Who had erewhile for me his station mov'd;
354,CANTO XVII,"When thus by lady: ""Give thy wish free vent,"
355,CANTO XVII,"That it may issue, bearing true report"
356,CANTO XVII,Of the mind's impress; not that aught thy words
357,CANTO XVII,"May to our knowledge add, but to the end,"
358,CANTO XVII,That thou mayst use thyself to own thy thirst
359,CANTO XVII,"And men may mingle for thee when they hear."""
360,CANTO XVII,
361,CANTO XVII,"""O plant! from whence I spring! rever'd and lov'd!"
362,CANTO XVII,"Who soar'st so high a pitch, thou seest as clear,"
363,CANTO XVII,As earthly thought determines two obtuse
364,CANTO XVII,"In one triangle not contain'd, so clear"
365,CANTO XVII,"Dost see contingencies, ere in themselves"
366,CANTO XVII,"Existent, looking at the point whereto"
367,CANTO XVII,"All times are present, I, the whilst I scal'd"
368,CANTO XVII,"With Virgil the soul purifying mount,"
369,CANTO XVII,"And visited the nether world of woe,"
370,CANTO XVII,Touching my future destiny have heard
371,CANTO XVII,"Words grievous, though I feel me on all sides"
372,CANTO XVII,Well squar'd to fortune's blows.  Therefore my will
373,CANTO XVII,"Were satisfied to know the lot awaits me,"
374,CANTO XVII,"The arrow, seen beforehand, slacks its flight."""
375,CANTO XVII,
376,CANTO XVII,"So said I to the brightness, which erewhile"
377,CANTO XVII,"To me had spoken, and my will declar'd,"
378,CANTO XVII,"As Beatrice will'd, explicitly."
379,CANTO XVII,"Nor with oracular response obscure,"
380,CANTO XVII,"Such, as or ere the Lamb of God was slain,"
381,CANTO XVII,"Beguil'd the credulous nations; but, in terms"
382,CANTO XVII,"Precise and unambiguous lore, replied"
383,CANTO XVII,"The spirit of paternal love, enshrin'd,"
384,CANTO XVII,Yet in his smile apparent; and thus spake:
385,CANTO XVII,"""Contingency, unfolded not to view"
386,CANTO XVII,"Upon the tablet of your mortal mold,"
387,CANTO XVII,Is all depictur'd in the' eternal sight;
388,CANTO XVII,"But hence deriveth not necessity,"
389,CANTO XVII,"More then the tall ship, hurried down the flood,"
390,CANTO XVII,"Doth from the vision, that reflects the scene."
391,CANTO XVII,"From thence, as to the ear sweet harmony"
392,CANTO XVII,"From organ comes, so comes before mine eye"
393,CANTO XVII,The time prepar'd for thee.  Such as driv'n out
394,CANTO XVII,"From Athens, by his cruel stepdame's wiles,"
395,CANTO XVII,"Hippolytus departed, such must thou"
396,CANTO XVII,"Depart from Florence.  This they wish, and this"
397,CANTO XVII,"Contrive, and will ere long effectuate, there,"
398,CANTO XVII,"Where gainful merchandize is made of Christ,"
399,CANTO XVII,"Throughout the livelong day.  The common cry,"
400,CANTO XVII,"Will, as 't is ever wont, affix the blame"
401,CANTO XVII,Unto the party injur'd: but the truth
402,CANTO XVII,"Shall, in the vengeance it dispenseth, find"

425,CANTO XVII,"So strongly from this star, that of his deeds"
426,CANTO XVII,The nations shall take note.  His unripe age
427,CANTO XVII,Yet holds him from observance; for these wheels
428,CANTO XVII,Only nine years have compass him about.
429,CANTO XVII,"But, ere the Gascon practice on great Harry,"

432,CANTO XVII,"His bounty shall be spread abroad so widely,"
433,CANTO XVII,As not to let the tongues e'en of his foes
434,CANTO XVII,Be idle in its praise.  Look thou to him
435,CANTO XVII,And his beneficence: for he shall cause
436,CANTO XVII,"Reversal of their lot to many people,"
437,CANTO XVII,Rich men and beggars interchanging fortunes.
438,CANTO XVII,And thou shalt bear this written in thy soul

796,CANTO XX,"The world's enlightener vanishes, and day"
797,CANTO XX,"On all sides wasteth, suddenly the sky,"
798,CANTO XX,"Erewhile irradiate only with his beam,"
799,CANTO XX,"Is yet again unfolded, putting forth"
800,CANTO XX,Innumerable lights wherein one shines.
801,CANTO XX,"Of such vicissitude in heaven I thought,"
802,CANTO XX,"As the great sign, that marshaleth the world"
803,CANTO XX,"And the world's leaders, in the blessed beak"
804,CANTO XX,"Was silent; for that all those living lights,"
805,CANTO XX,"Waxing in splendour, burst forth into songs,"
806,CANTO XX,Such as from memory glide and fall away.
807,CANTO XX,
808,CANTO XX,"Sweet love! that dost apparel thee in smiles,"
809,CANTO XX,"How lustrous was thy semblance in those sparkles,"
810,CANTO XX,Which merely are from holy thoughts inspir'd!
811,CANTO XX,
812,CANTO XX,"After the precious and bright beaming stones,"
813,CANTO XX,"That did ingem the sixth light, ceas'd the chiming"
814,CANTO XX,Of their angelic bells; methought I heard
815,CANTO XX,"The murmuring of a river, that doth fall"
816,CANTO XX,"From rock to rock transpicuous, making known"
817,CANTO XX,The richness of his spring-head: and as sound
818,CANTO XX,"Of cistern, at the fret-board, or of pipe,"
819,CANTO XX,"Is, at the wind-hole, modulate and tun'd;"
820,CANTO XX,"Thus up the neck, as it were hollow, rose"
821,CANTO XX,"That murmuring of the eagle, and forthwith"
822,CANTO XX,"Voice there assum'd, and thence along the beak"
823,CANTO XX,"Issued in form of words, such as my heart"
824,CANTO XX,"Did look for, on whose tables I inscrib'd them."
825,CANTO XX,
826,CANTO XX,"""The part in me, that sees, and bears the sun,,"
827,CANTO XX,"In mortal eagles,"" it began, ""must now"
828,CANTO XX,"Be noted steadfastly: for of the fires,"
829,CANTO XX,"That figure me, those, glittering in mine eye,"
830,CANTO XX,"Are chief of all the greatest.  This, that shines"
831,CANTO XX,"Midmost for pupil, was the same, who sang"
832,CANTO XX,"The Holy Spirit's song, and bare about"
833,CANTO XX,The ark from town to town; now doth he know
834,CANTO XX,The merit of his soul-impassion'd strains
835,CANTO XX,"By their well-fitted guerdon.  Of the five,"
836,CANTO XX,"That make the circle of the vision, he"
837,CANTO XX,"Who to the beak is nearest, comforted"
838,CANTO XX,The widow for her son: now doth he know
839,CANTO XX,"How dear he costeth not to follow Christ,"
840,CANTO XX,"Both from experience of this pleasant life,"
841,CANTO XX,"And of its opposite.  He next, who follows"
842,CANTO XX,"In the circumference, for the over arch,"
843,CANTO XX,By true repenting slack'd the pace of death:
844,CANTO XX,"Now knoweth he, that the degrees of heav'n"
845,CANTO XX,"Alter not, when through pious prayer below"
846,CANTO XX,Today's is made tomorrow's destiny.
847,CANTO XX,"The other following, with the laws and me,"
848,CANTO XX,"To yield the shepherd room, pass'd o'er to Greece,"
849,CANTO XX,From good intent producing evil fruit:
850,CANTO XX,"Now knoweth he, how all the ill, deriv'd"
851,CANTO XX,"From his well doing, doth not helm him aught,"
852,CANTO XX,Though it have brought destruction on the world.
853,CANTO XX,"That, which thou seest in the under bow,"
854,CANTO XX,"Was William, whom that land bewails, which weeps"
855,CANTO XX,For Charles and Frederick living: now he knows
856,CANTO XX,"How well is lov'd in heav'n the righteous king,"
857,CANTO XX,Which he betokens by his radiant seeming.
858,CANTO XX,"Who in the erring world beneath would deem,"
859,CANTO XX,That Trojan Ripheus in this round was set
860,CANTO XX,Fifth of the saintly splendours?  now he knows
861,CANTO XX,"Enough of that, which the world cannot see,"
862,CANTO XX,"The grace divine, albeit e'en his sight"

864,CANTO XX,"That warbling in the air expatiates long,"
865,CANTO XX,"Then, trilling out his last sweet melody,"
866,CANTO XX,Drops satiate with the sweetness; such appear'd
867,CANTO XX,"That image stampt by the' everlasting pleasure,"
868,CANTO XX,Which fashions like itself all lovely things.
869,CANTO XX,
870,CANTO XX,"I, though my doubting were as manifest,"
871,CANTO XX,"As is through glass the hue that mantles it,"
872,CANTO XX,In silence waited not: for to my lips
873,CANTO XX,"""What things are these?""  involuntary rush'd,"
874,CANTO XX,And forc'd a passage out: whereat I mark'd
875,CANTO XX,A sudden lightening and new revelry.
876,CANTO XX,The eye was kindled: and the blessed sign
877,CANTO XX,"No more to keep me wond'ring and suspense,"
878,CANTO XX,"Replied: ""I see that thou believ'st these things,"
879,CANTO XX,"Because I tell them, but discern'st not how;"
880,CANTO XX,So that thy knowledge waits not on thy faith:
881,CANTO XX,"As one who knows the name of thing by rote,"
882,CANTO XX,"But is a stranger to its properties,"
883,CANTO XX,Till other's tongue reveal them.  Fervent love
884,CANTO XX,And lively hope with violence assail
885,CANTO XX,"The kingdom of the heavens, and overcome"
886,CANTO XX,The will of the Most high; not in such sort
887,CANTO XX,"As man prevails o'er man; but conquers it,"
888,CANTO XX,"Because 't is willing to be conquer'd, still,"
889,CANTO XX,"Though conquer'd, by its mercy conquering."
890,CANTO XX,
891,CANTO XX,"""Those, in the eye who live the first and fifth,"
892,CANTO XX,"Cause thee to marvel, in that thou behold'st"
893,CANTO XX,The region of the angels deck'd with them.
894,CANTO XX,"They quitted not their bodies, as thou deem'st,"
895,CANTO XX,"Gentiles but Christians, in firm rooted faith,"
896,CANTO XX,"This of the feet in future to be pierc'd,"
897,CANTO XX,That of feet nail'd already to the cross.
898,CANTO XX,"One from the barrier of the dark abyss,"
899,CANTO XX,"Where never any with good will returns,"
900,CANTO XX,Came back unto his bones.  Of lively hope
901,CANTO XX,"Such was the meed; of lively hope, that wing'd"
902,CANTO XX,"The prayers sent up to God for his release,"
903,CANTO XX,And put power into them to bend his will.
904,CANTO XX,"The glorious Spirit, of whom I speak to thee,"
905,CANTO XX,"A little while returning to the flesh,"
906,CANTO XX,"Believ'd in him, who had the means to help,"
907,CANTO XX,"And, in believing, nourish'd such a flame"
908,CANTO XX,"Of holy love, that at the second death"
909,CANTO XX,He was made sharer in our gamesome mirth.
910,CANTO XX,"The other, through the riches of that grace,"
911,CANTO XX,"Which from so deep a fountain doth distil,"
912,CANTO XX,"As never eye created saw its rising,"
913,CANTO XX,Plac'd all his love below on just and right:
914,CANTO XX,Wherefore of grace God op'd in him the eye
915,CANTO XX,To the redemption of mankind to come;
916,CANTO XX,"Wherein believing, he endur'd no more"
917,CANTO XX,"The filth of paganism, and for their ways"
918,CANTO XX,"Rebuk'd the stubborn nations.  The three nymphs,"
919,CANTO XX,"Whom at the right wheel thou beheldst advancing,"
920,CANTO XX,Were sponsors for him more than thousand years
921,CANTO XX,"Before baptizing.  O how far remov'd,"
922,CANTO XX,Predestination! is thy root from such
923,CANTO XX,"As see not the First cause entire: and ye,"
924,CANTO XX,O mortal men! be wary how ye judge:
925,CANTO XX,"For we, who see our Maker, know not yet"
926,CANTO XX,The number of the chosen: and esteem
927,CANTO XX,Such scantiness of knowledge our delight:
928,CANTO XX,For all our good is in that primal good
929,CANTO XX,"Concentrate, and God's will and ours are one."""
930,CANTO XX,
931,CANTO XX,"So, by that form divine, was giv'n to me"
932,CANTO XX,"Sweet medicine to clear and strengthen sight,"
933,CANTO XX,"And, as one handling skillfully the harp,"
934,CANTO XX,Attendant on some skilful songster's voice
935,CANTO XX,"Bids the chords vibrate, and therein the song"
936,CANTO XX,"Acquires more pleasure; so, the whilst it spake,"
937,CANTO XX,"It doth remember me, that I beheld"
938,CANTO XX,The pair of blessed luminaries move.
939,CANTO XX,"Like the accordant twinkling of two eyes,"
940,CANTO XX,"Their beamy circlets, dancing to the sounds."
941,CANTO XX,
942,CANTO XX,
943,CANTO XX,
944,CANTO XX,
945,CANTO XXI,CANTO XXI
946,CANTO XXI,
947,CANTO XXI,"Again mine eyes were fix'd on Beatrice,"
948,CANTO XXI,"And with mine eyes my soul, that in her looks"
949,CANTO XXI,Found all contentment.  Yet no smile she wore
950,CANTO XXI,"And, ""Did I smile,"" quoth she, ""thou wouldst be straight"
951,CANTO XXI,Like Semele when into ashes turn'd:
952,CANTO XXI,"For, mounting these eternal palace-stairs,"
953,CANTO XXI,"My beauty, which the loftier it climbs,"
954,CANTO XXI,"As thou hast noted, still doth kindle more,"
955,CANTO XXI,"So shines, that, were no temp'ring interpos'd,"
956,CANTO XXI,Thy mortal puissance would from its rays
957,CANTO XXI,"Shrink, as the leaf doth from the thunderbolt."
958,CANTO XXI,"Into the seventh splendour are we wafted,"
959,CANTO XXI,That underneath the burning lion's breast
960,CANTO XXI,"Beams, in this hour, commingled with his might,"
961,CANTO XXI,Thy mind be with thine eyes: and in them mirror'd
962,CANTO XXI,"The shape, which in this mirror shall be shown."""
963,CANTO XXI,"Whoso can deem, how fondly I had fed"
964,CANTO XXI,"My sight upon her blissful countenance,"
965,CANTO XXI,"May know, when to new thoughts I chang'd, what joy"
966,CANTO XXI,To do the bidding of my heav'nly guide:
967,CANTO XXI,In equal balance poising either weight.
968,CANTO XXI,
969,CANTO XXI,"Within the crystal, which records the name,"
970,CANTO XXI,(As its remoter circle girds the world)
971,CANTO XXI,"Of that lov'd monarch, in whose happy reign"
972,CANTO XXI,"No ill had power to harm, I saw rear'd up,"
973,CANTO XXI,In colour like to sun-illumin'd gold.
974,CANTO XXI,
975,CANTO XXI,"A ladder, which my ken pursued in vain,"
976,CANTO XXI,So lofty was the summit; down whose steps
977,CANTO XXI,I saw the splendours in such multitude
978,CANTO XXI,"Descending, ev'ry light in heav'n, methought,"
979,CANTO XXI,"Was shed thence.  As the rooks, at dawn of day"
980,CANTO XXI,"Bestirring them to dry their feathers chill,"
981,CANTO XXI,"Some speed their way a-field, and homeward some,"
982,CANTO XXI,"Returning, cross their flight, while some abide"
983,CANTO XXI,And wheel around their airy lodge; so seem'd
984,CANTO XXI,"That glitterance, wafted on alternate wing,"
985,CANTO XXI,"As upon certain stair it met, and clash'd"
986,CANTO XXI,"Its shining. And one ling'ring near us, wax'd"
987,CANTO XXI,"So bright, that in my thought: said: ""The love,"
988,CANTO XXI,"Which this betokens me, admits no doubt."""
989,CANTO XXI,
990,CANTO XXI,"Unwillingly from question I refrain,"
991,CANTO XXI,"To her, by whom my silence and my speech"
992,CANTO XXI,"Are order'd, looking for a sign: whence she,"
993,CANTO XXI,"Who in the sight of Him, that seeth all,"
994,CANTO XXI,"Saw wherefore I was silent, prompted me"
995,CANTO XXI,T' indulge the fervent wish; and I began:
996,CANTO XXI,"""I am not worthy, of my own desert,"
997,CANTO XXI,"That thou shouldst answer me; but for her sake,"
998,CANTO XXI,"Who hath vouchsaf'd my asking, spirit blest!"
999,CANTO XXI,"That in thy joy art shrouded! say the cause,"
1000,CANTO XXI,"Which bringeth thee so near: and wherefore, say,"
1001,CANTO XXI,Doth the sweet symphony of Paradise
1002,CANTO XXI,"Keep silence here, pervading with such sounds"
1003,CANTO XXI,"Of rapt devotion ev'ry lower sphere?"""
1004,CANTO XXI,"""Mortal art thou in hearing as in sight;"""
1005,CANTO XXI,"Was the reply: ""and what forbade the smile"
1006,CANTO XXI,Of Beatrice interrupts our song.
1007,CANTO XXI,"Only to yield thee gladness of my voice,"
1008,CANTO XXI,"And of the light that vests me, I thus far"
1009,CANTO XXI,Descend these hallow'd steps: not that more love
1010,CANTO XXI,"Invites me; for lo! there aloft, as much"
1011,CANTO XXI,Or more of love is witness'd in those flames:
1012,CANTO XXI,"But such my lot by charity assign'd,"
1013,CANTO XXI,"That makes us ready servants, as thou seest,"
1014,CANTO XXI,"To execute the counsel of the Highest."""
1015,CANTO XXI,"""That in this court,"" said I, ""O sacred lamp!"
1016,CANTO XXI,"Love no compulsion needs, but follows free"
1017,CANTO XXI,"Th' eternal Providence, I well discern:"
1018,CANTO XXI,"This harder find to deem, why of thy peers"
1019,CANTO XXI,"Thou only to this office wert foredoom'd."""
1020,CANTO XXI,"I had not ended, when, like rapid mill,"
1021,CANTO XXI,Upon its centre whirl'd the light; and then
1022,CANTO XXI,"The love, that did inhabit there, replied:"
1023,CANTO XXI,"""Splendour eternal, piercing through these folds,"
1024,CANTO XXI,"Its virtue to my vision knits, and thus"
1025,CANTO XXI,"Supported, lifts me so above myself,"
1026,CANTO XXI,"That on the sov'ran essence, which it wells from,"
1027,CANTO XXI,"I have the power to gaze: and hence the joy,"
1028,CANTO XXI,"Wherewith I sparkle, equaling with my blaze"
1029,CANTO XXI,"The keenness of my sight.  But not the soul,"
1030,CANTO XXI,"That is in heav'n most lustrous, nor the seraph"
1031,CANTO XXI,"That hath his eyes most fix'd on God, shall solve"
1032,CANTO XXI,What thou hast ask'd: for in th' abyss it lies
1033,CANTO XXI,"Of th' everlasting statute sunk so low,"
1034,CANTO XXI,That no created ken may fathom it.
1035,CANTO XXI,"And, to the mortal world when thou return'st,"
1036,CANTO XXI,Be this reported; that none henceforth dare
1037,CANTO XXI,Direct his footsteps to so dread a bourn.
1038,CANTO XXI,"The mind, that here is radiant, on the earth"
1039,CANTO XXI,"Is wrapt in mist.  Look then if she may do,"
1040,CANTO XXI,"Below, what passeth her ability,"
1041,CANTO XXI,"When she is ta'en to heav'n.""  By words like these"
1042,CANTO XXI,"Admonish'd, I the question urg'd no more;"
1043,CANTO XXI,And of the spirit humbly sued alone
1044,CANTO XXI,"T' instruct me of its state.  ""'Twixt either shore"
1045,CANTO XXI,"Of Italy, nor distant from thy land,"
1046,CANTO XXI,"A stony ridge ariseth, in such sort,"
1047,CANTO XXI,"The thunder doth not lift his voice so high,"
1048,CANTO XXI,They call it Catria: at whose foot a cell
1049,CANTO XXI,"Is sacred to the lonely Eremite,"
1050,CANTO XXI,"For worship set apart and holy rites."""
1051,CANTO XXI,"A third time thus it spake; then added: ""There"
1052,CANTO XXI,"So firmly to God's service I adher'd,"
1053,CANTO XXI,That with no costlier viands than the juice
1054,CANTO XXI,"Of olives, easily I pass'd the heats"
1055,CANTO XXI,"Of summer and the winter frosts, content"
1056,CANTO XXI,In heav'n-ward musings.  Rich were the returns
1057,CANTO XXI,"And fertile, which that cloister once was us'd"
1058,CANTO XXI,To render to these heavens: now 't is fall'n
1059,CANTO XXI,"Into a waste so empty, that ere long"
1060,CANTO XXI,Detection must lay bare its vanity
1061,CANTO XXI,Pietro Damiano there was I yclept:
1062,CANTO XXI,"Pietro the sinner, when before I dwelt"
1063,CANTO XXI,"Beside the Adriatic, in the house"
1064,CANTO XXI,Of our blest Lady.  Near upon my close
1065,CANTO XXI,"Of mortal life, through much importuning"
1066,CANTO XXI,I was constrain'd to wear the hat that still
1067,CANTO XXI,From bad to worse it shifted.--Cephas came;
1068,CANTO XXI,"He came, who was the Holy Spirit's vessel,"
1069,CANTO XXI,"Barefoot and lean, eating their bread, as chanc'd,"
1070,CANTO XXI,At the first table.  Modern Shepherd's need
1071,CANTO XXI,"Those who on either hand may prop and lead them,"
1072,CANTO XXI,So burly are they grown: and from behind
1073,CANTO XXI,Others to hoist them.  Down the palfrey's sides
1074,CANTO XXI,"Spread their broad mantles, so as both the beasts"
1075,CANTO XXI,Are cover'd with one skin.  O patience! thou
1076,CANTO XXI,"That lookst on this and doth endure so long."""
1077,CANTO XXI,I at those accents saw the splendours down
1078,CANTO XXI,"From step to step alight, and wheel, and wax,"
1079,CANTO XXI,"Each circuiting, more beautiful.  Round this"
1080,CANTO XXI,"They came, and stay'd them; uttered them a shout"
1081,CANTO XXI,"So loud, it hath no likeness here: nor I"
1082,CANTO XXI,"Wist what it spake, so deaf'ning was the thunder."
