20,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,
21,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,There are few modern poems of any country so perfect in their
22,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"kind as the ""Hermann and Dorothea"" of Goethe. In clearness"
23,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"of characterization, in unity of tone, in the adjustment of"
24,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"background and foreground, in the conduct of the narrative,"
25,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,it conforms admirably to the strict canons of art; yet it
26,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,preserves a freshness and spontaneity in its emotional appeal
27,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,that are rare in works of so classical a perfection in form.
28,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,
29,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,The basis of the poem is a historical incident. In the year 1731
30,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,the Archbishop of Salzburg drove out of his diocese a thousand
31,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"Protestants, who took refuge in South Germany, and among whom"
32,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,was a girl who became the bride of the son of a rich burgher.
33,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,The occasion of the girl's exile was changed by Goethe to more
34,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"recent times, and in the poem she is represented as a German from"
35,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,the west bank of the Rhine fleeing from the turmoil caused by the
36,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"French Revolution. The political element is not a mere background,"
37,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"but is woven into the plot with consummate skill, being used,"
38,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"at one point, for example, in the characterization of Dorothea,"
39,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,who before the time of her appearance in the poem has been
40,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"deprived of her first betrothed by the guillotine; and, at another,"
41,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,in furnishing a telling contrast between the revolutionary uproar
42,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,in France and the settled peace of the German village.
43,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,
44,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,The characters of the father and the minister Goethe took over
45,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"from the original incident, the mother he invented, and the"
46,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,apothecary he made to stand for a group of friends. But all of
47,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"these persons, as well as the two lovers, are recreated, and this"
48,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,so skillfully that while they are made notably familiar to us as
49,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"individuals, they are no less significant as permanent types of"
50,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"human nature. The hexameter measure which he employed, and which"
51,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"is retained in the present translation, he handled with such"
52,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,charm that it has since seemed the natural verse for the domestic
53,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"idyl--witness the obvious imitation of this, as of other"
54,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"features of the poem, in Longfellow's ""Evangeline."""
55,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,
56,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"Taken as a whole, with its beauty of form, its sentiment, tender"
57,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"yet restrained, and the compelling pathos of its story, ""Hermann"
58,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"and Dorothea"" appeals to a wider public than perhaps any other"
59,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,product of its author.

70,FATE AND SYMPATHY,
71,FATE AND SYMPATHY,
72,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"""Truly, I never have seen the market and street so deserted!"
73,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"How as if it were swept looks the town, or had perished! Not fifty"
74,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Are there, methinks, of all our inhabitants in it remaining,"
75,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"What will not curiosity do! here is every one running,"
76,FATE AND SYMPATHY,Hurrying to gaze on the sad procession of pitiful exiles.
77,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Fully a league it must be to the causeway they have to pass over,"
78,FATE AND SYMPATHY,Yet all are hurrying down in the dusty heat of the noonday.
79,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"I, in good sooth, would not stir from my place to witness the sorrows"
80,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Borne by good, fugitive people, who now, with their rescued possessions,"
81,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Driven, alas! from beyond the Rhine, their beautiful country,"
82,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Over to us are coming, and through the prosperous corner"
83,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Roam of this our luxuriant valley, and traverse its windings."
84,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Well hast thou done, good wife, our son in thus kindly dispatching,"
85,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Laden with something to eat and to drink, and with store of old linen,"
86,FATE AND SYMPATHY,'Mongst the poor folk to distribute; for giving belongs to the wealthy.
87,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"How the youth drives, to be sure! What control he has over the horses!"
88,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Makes not our carriage a handsome appearance,--the new one? With comfort,"
89,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Four could be seated within, with a place on the box for the coachman."
90,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"This time, he drove by himself. How lightly it rolled round the corner!"""
91,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Thus, as he sat at his ease in the porch of his house on the market,"
92,FATE AND SYMPATHY,Unto his wife was speaking mine host of the Golden Lion.
93,FATE AND SYMPATHY,
94,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Thereupon answered and said the prudent, intelligent housewife:"
95,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"""Father, I am not inclined to be giving away my old linen:"
96,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Since it serves many a purpose; and cannot be purchased for money,"
97,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"When we may want it. To-day, however, I gave, and with pleasure,"
98,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Many a piece that was better, indeed, in shirts and in bed-clothes;"
99,FATE AND SYMPATHY,For I was told of the aged and children who had to go naked.
100,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"But wilt thou pardon me, father? thy wardrobe has also been plundered."
101,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"And, in especial, the wrapper that has the East-Indian flowers,"
102,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Made of the finest of chintz, and lined with delicate flannel,"
103,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Gave I away: it was thin and old, and quite out of the fashion."""
104,FATE AND SYMPATHY,
105,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Thereupon answered and said, with a smile, the excellent landlord:"
106,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"""Faith! I am sorry to lose it, my good old calico wrapper,"
107,FATE AND SYMPATHY,Real East-Indian stuff: I never shall get such another.
108,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Well, I had given up wearing it: nowadays, custom compels us"
109,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Always to go in surtout, and never appear but in jacket;"
110,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Always to have on our boots; forbidden are night-cap and slippers."""
111,FATE AND SYMPATHY,
112,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"""See!"" interrupted the wife; ""even now some are yonder returning,"
113,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Who have beheld the procession: it must, then, already be over."
114,FATE AND SYMPATHY,Look at the dust on their shoes! and see how their faces are glowing!
115,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Every one carries his kerchief, and with it is wiping the sweat off."
116,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Not for a sight like that would I run so far and so suffer,"
117,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Through such a heat; in sooth, enough shall I have in the telling."""
118,FATE AND SYMPATHY,
119,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Thereupon answered and said, with emphasis, thus, the good father:"
120,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"""Rarely does weather like this attend such a harvest as this is."
121,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"We shall be bringing our grain in dry, as the hay was before it."
122,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Not the least cloud to be seen, so perfectly clear is the heaven;"
123,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"And, with delicious coolness, the wind blows in from the eastward."
124,FATE AND SYMPATHY,That is the weather to last! over-ripe are the cornfields already;
125,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"We shall begin on the morrow to gather our copious harvest."""
126,FATE AND SYMPATHY,
127,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Constantly, while he thus spoke, the crowds of men and of women"
128,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Grew, who their homeward way were over the market-place wending;"
129,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"And, with the rest, there also returned, his daughters beside him,"
130,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Back to his modernized house on the opposite side of the market,"
131,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Foremost merchant of all the town, their opulent neighbor,"
132,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Rapidly driving his open barouche,--it was builded in Landau."
133,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Lively now grew the streets, for the city was handsomely peopled."
134,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Many a trade was therein carried on, and large manufactures."
135,FATE AND SYMPATHY,
136,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Under their doorway thus the affectionate couple were sitting,"
137,FATE AND SYMPATHY,Pleasing themselves with many remarks on the wandering people.
138,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Finally broke in, however, the worthy housewife, exclaiming:"
139,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"""Yonder our pastor, see! is hitherward coming, and with him"
140,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Comes our neighbor the doctor, so they shall every thing tell us;"
141,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"All they have witnessed abroad, and which 'tis a sorrow to look on."""
142,FATE AND SYMPATHY,
143,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Cordially then the two men drew nigh, and saluted the couple;"
144,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Sat themselves down on the benches of wood that were placed in the doorway,"
145,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Shaking the dust from their feet, and fanning themselves with their kerchiefs."
146,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Then was the doctor, as soon as exchanged were the mutual greetings,"
147,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"First to begin, and said, almost in a tone of vexation:"
148,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"""Such is mankind, forsooth! and one man is just like another,"
149,FATE AND SYMPATHY,Liking to gape and to stare when ill-luck has befallen his neighbor.
150,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Every one hurries to look at the flames, as they soar in destruction;"
151,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Runs to behold the poor culprit, to execution conducted:"
152,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Now all are sallying forth to gaze on the need of these exiles,"
153,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Nor is there one who considers that he, by a similar fortune,"
154,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"May, in the future, if not indeed next, be likewise o'ertaken."
155,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Levity not to be pardoned, I deem; yet it lies in man's nature."""
156,FATE AND SYMPATHY,
157,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Thereupon answered and said the noble, intelligent pastor;"
158,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Ornament he of the town, still young, in the prime of his manhood."
159,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"He was acquainted with life,--with the needs of his hearers acquainted;"
160,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Deeply imbued he was with the Holy Scriptures' importance,"
161,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"As they reveal man's destiny to us, and man's disposition;"
162,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Thoroughly versed, besides, in best of secular writings."
163,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"""I should be loath,"" he replied, ""to censure an innocent instinct,"
164,FATE AND SYMPATHY,Which to mankind by good mother Nature has always been given.
165,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"What understanding and reason may sometimes fail to accomplish,"
166,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Oft will such fortunate impulse, that bears us resistlessly with it."
167,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Did curiosity draw not man with its potent attraction,"
168,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Say, would he ever have learned how harmoniously fitted together"
169,FATE AND SYMPATHY,Worldly experiences are? For first what is novel he covets;
170,FATE AND SYMPATHY,Then with unwearying industry follows he after the useful;
171,FATE AND SYMPATHY,Finally longs for the good by which he is raised and ennobled.
172,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"While he is young, such lightness of mind is a joyous companion,"
173,FATE AND SYMPATHY,Traces of pain-giving evil effacing as soon as 'tis over.
174,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"He is indeed to be praised, who, out of this gladness of temper,"
175,FATE AND SYMPATHY,Has in his ripening years a sound understanding developed;
176,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Who, in good fortune or ill, with zeal and activity labors:"
177,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Such an one bringeth to pass what is good, and repaireth the evil."""
178,FATE AND SYMPATHY,
179,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Then broke familiarly in the housewife impatient, exclaiming:"
180,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"""Tell us of what ye have seen; for that I am longing to hear of!"""
181,FATE AND SYMPATHY,
182,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"""Hardly,"" with emphasis then the village doctor made answer,"
183,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"""Can I find spirits so soon after all the scenes I have witnessed."
184,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Oh, the manifold miseries! who shall be able to tell them?"
185,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"E'en before crossing the meadows, and while we were yet at a distance,"
186,FATE AND SYMPATHY,Saw we the dust; but still from hill to hill the procession
187,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Passed away out of our sight, and we could distinguish but little,"
188,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"But when at last we were come to the street that crosses the valley,"
189,FATE AND SYMPATHY,Great was the crowd and confusion of persons on foot and of wagons.
190,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"There, alas! saw we enough of these poor unfortunates passing,"
191,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"And could from some of them learn how bitter the sorrowful flight was,"
192,FATE AND SYMPATHY,Yet how joyful the feeling of life thus hastily rescued.
193,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Mournful it was to behold the most miscellaneous chattels,--"
194,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"All those things which are housed in every well-furnished dwelling,"
195,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"All by the house-keeper's care set up in their suitable places,"
196,FATE AND SYMPATHY,Always ready for use; for useful is each and important.--
197,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Now these things to behold, piled up on all manner of wagons,"
198,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"One on the top of another, as hurriedly they had been rescued."
199,FATE AND SYMPATHY,Over the chest of drawers were the sieve and wool coverlet lying;
200,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Thrown in the kneading-trough lay the bed, and the sheets on the mirror."
201,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Danger, alas! as we learned ourselves in our great conflagration"
202,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Twenty years since, will take from a man all power of reflection,"
203,FATE AND SYMPATHY,So that he grasps things worthless and leaves what is precious behind him.
204,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Here, too, with unconsidering care they were carrying with them"
205,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Pitiful trash, that only encumbered the horses and oxen;"
206,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Such as old barrels and boards, the pen for the goose, and the bird-cage."
207,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Women and children, too, went toiling along with their bundles,"
208,FATE AND SYMPATHY,
209,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"""Panting 'neath baskets and tubs, full of things of no manner of value:"
210,FATE AND SYMPATHY,So unwilling is man to relinquish his meanest possession.
211,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Thus on the dusty road the crowded procession moved forward,"
212,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"All confused and disordered. The one whose beasts were the weaker,"
213,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Wanted more slowly to drive, while faster would hurry another."
214,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Presently went up a scream from the closely squeezed women and children,"
215,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"And with the yelping of dogs was mingled the lowing of cattle,"
216,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Cries of distress from the aged and sick, who aloft on the wagon,"
217,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Heavy and thus overpacked, upon beds were sitting and swaying."
218,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Pressed at last from the rut and out to the edge of the highway,"
219,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Slipped the creaking wheel; the cart lost its balance, and over"
220,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Fell in the ditch. In the swing the people were flung to a distance,"
221,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Far off into the field, with horrible screams; by good fortune"
222,FATE AND SYMPATHY,Later the boxes were thrown and fell more near to the wagon.
223,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Verily all who had witnessed the fall, expected to see them"
224,FATE AND SYMPATHY,Crushed into pieces beneath the weight of trunks and of presses.
225,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"So lay the cart all broken to fragments, and helpless the people."
226,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Keeping their onward way, the others drove hastily by them,"
227,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Each thinking only of self, and carried away by the current."
228,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Then we ran to the spot, and found the sick and the aged,--"
229,FATE AND SYMPATHY,Those who at home and in bed could before their lingering ailments
230,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Scarcely endure,--lying bruised on the ground, complaining and groaning,"
231,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Choked by the billowing dust, and scorched by the heat of the noonday."""
232,FATE AND SYMPATHY,
233,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Thereupon answered and said the kind-hearted landlord, with feeling:"
234,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"""Would that our Hermann might meet them and give them refreshment and clothing!"
235,FATE AND SYMPATHY,Loath should I be to behold them: the looking on suffering pains me.
236,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Touched by the earliest tidings of their so cruel afflictions,"
237,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Hastily sent we a mite from out of our super-abundance,"
238,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Only that some might be strengthened, and we might ourselves be made easy."
239,FATE AND SYMPATHY,But let us now no longer renew these sorrowful pictures
240,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Knowing how readily fear steals into the heart of us mortals,"
241,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"And anxiety, worse to me than the actual evil."
242,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Come with me into the room behind, our cool little parlor,"
243,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Where no sunbeam e'er shines, and no sultry breath ever enters"
244,FATE AND SYMPATHY,Through its thickness of wall. There mother will bring us a flagon
245,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Of our old eighty-three, with which we may banish our fancies."
246,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Here 'tis not cosey to drink: the flies so buzz round the glasses."""
247,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Thither adjourned they then, and all rejoiced in the coolness."
248,FATE AND SYMPATHY,
249,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Carefully brought forth the mother the clear and glorious vintage,"
250,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Cased in a well-polished flask, on a waiter of glittering pewter,"
251,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Set round with large green glasses, the drinking cups meet for the Rhine Wine."
252,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"So sat the three together about the highly waxed table,"
253,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Gleaming and round and brown, that on mighty feet was supported,"
254,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Joyously rang at once the glasses of landlord and pastor,"
255,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"But his motionless held the third, and sat lost in reflection,"
256,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Until with words of good-humor the landlord challenged him, saying,--"
257,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"""Come, sir neighbor, empty your glass, for God in his mercy"
258,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Thus far has kept us from evil, and so in the future will keep us."
259,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"For who acknowledges not, that since our dread conflagration,"
260,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"When he so hardly chastised us, he now is continually blessing,"
261,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Constantly shielding, as man the apple of his eye watches over,"
262,FATE AND SYMPATHY,Holding it precious and dear above all the rest of his members?
263,FATE AND SYMPATHY,Shall he in time to come not defend us and furnish us succor?
264,FATE AND SYMPATHY,Only when danger is nigh do we see how great is his power.
265,FATE AND SYMPATHY,Shall he this blooming town which he once by industrious burghers
266,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Built up afresh from its ashes, and afterwards blessed with abundance,"
267,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Now demolish again, and bring all the labor to nothing?"""
268,FATE AND SYMPATHY,
269,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Cheerfully said in reply the excellent pastor, and kindly:"
270,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"""Keep thyself firm in the faith, and firm abide in this temper;"
271,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"For it makes steadfast and wise when fortune is fair, and when evil,"
272,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Furnishes sweet consolation and animates hopes the sublimest."""
273,FATE AND SYMPATHY,
274,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Then made answer the landlord, with thoughts judicious and manly:"
275,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"""Often the Rhine's broad stream have I with astonishment greeted,"
276,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"As I have neared it again, after travelling abroad upon business."
277,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Always majestic it seemed, and my mind and spirit exalted."
278,FATE AND SYMPATHY,But I could never imagine its beautiful banks would so shortly
279,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Be to a rampart transformed, to keep from our borders the Frenchman,"
280,FATE AND SYMPATHY,And its wide-spreading bed be a moat all passage to hinder.
281,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"See! thus nature protects, the stout-hearted Germans protect us,"
282,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"And thus protects us the Lord, who then will he weakly despondent?"
283,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Weary already the combatants, all indications are peaceful."
284,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Would it might be that when that festival, ardently longed for,"
285,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Shall in our church be observed, when the sacred Te Deum is rising,"
286,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Swelled by the pealing of organ and bells, and the blaring of trumpets,--"
287,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Would it might be that that day should behold my Hermann, sir pastor,"
288,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Standing, his choice now made, with his bride before thee at the altar,"
289,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Making that festal day, that through every land shall be honored,"
290,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"My anniversary, too, henceforth of domestic rejoicing!"
291,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"But I observe with regret, that the youth so efficient and active"
292,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Ever in household affairs, when abroad is timid and backward."
293,FATE AND SYMPATHY,Little enjoyment he finds in going about among others;
294,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Nay, he will even avoid young ladies' society wholly;"
295,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Shuns the enlivening dance which all young persons delight in."""
296,FATE AND SYMPATHY,
297,FATE AND SYMPATHY,Thus he spoke and listened; for now was heard in the distance
298,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Clattering of horses' hoofs drawing near, and the roll of the wagon,"
299,FATE AND SYMPATHY,"Which, with furious haste, came thundering under the gateway."

307,HERMANN,
308,HERMANN,"Now when of comely mien the son came into the chamber,"
309,HERMANN,"Turned with a searching look the eyes of the preacher upon him,"
310,HERMANN,"And, with the gaze of the student, who easily fathoms expression,"
311,HERMANN,Scrutinized well his face and form and his general bearing.
312,HERMANN,"Then with a smile he spoke, and said in words of affection:"
313,HERMANN,"""Truly a different being thou comest! I never have seen thee"
314,HERMANN,"Cheerful as now, nor ever beheld I thy glances so beaming."
315,HERMANN,"Joyous thou comest, and happy: 'tis plain that among the poor people"
316,HERMANN,"Thou hast been sharing thy gifts, and receiving their blessings upon thee."""
317,HERMANN,
318,HERMANN,"Quietly then, and with serious words, the son made him answer:"
319,HERMANN,"""If I have acted as ye will commend, I know not; but I followed"
320,HERMANN,"That which my heart bade me do, as I shall exactly relate you."
321,HERMANN,"Thou wert, mother, so long in rummaging 'mong thy old pieces,"
322,HERMANN,"Picking and choosing, that not until late was thy bundle together;"
323,HERMANN,Then too the wine and the beer took care and time in the packing.
324,HERMANN,"When I came forth through the gateway at last, and out on the high-road,"
325,HERMANN,"Backward the crowd of citizens streamed with women and children,"
326,HERMANN,Coming to meet me; for far was already the band of the exiles.
327,HERMANN,"Quicker I kept on my way, and drove with speed to the village,"
328,HERMANN,"Where they were meaning to rest, as I heard, and tarry till morning."
329,HERMANN,"Thitherward up the new street as I hasted, a stout-timbered wagon,"
330,HERMANN,"Drawn by two oxen, I saw, of that region the largest and strongest;"
331,HERMANN,"While, with vigorous steps, a maiden was walking beside them,"
332,HERMANN,"And, a long staff in her hand, the two powerful creatures was guiding,"
333,HERMANN,"Urging them now, now holding them back; with skill did she drive them."
334,HERMANN,"Soon as the maiden perceived me, she calmly drew near to the horses,"
335,HERMANN,And in these words she addressed me: 'Not thus deplorable always
336,HERMANN,"Has our condition been, as to-day on this journey thou seest."
337,HERMANN,"I am not yet grown used to asking gifts of a stranger,"
338,HERMANN,"Which he will often unwillingly give, to be rid of the beggar."
339,HERMANN,"But necessity drives me to speak; for here, on the straw, lies"
340,HERMANN,"Newly delivered of child, a rich land-owner's wife, whom I scarcely"
341,HERMANN,"Have in her pregnancy, safe brought off with the oxen and wagon."
342,HERMANN,"Naked, now in her arms the new-born infant is lying,"
343,HERMANN,"And but little the help our friends will be able to furnish,"
344,HERMANN,"If in the neighboring village, indeed, where to-day we would rest us,"
345,HERMANN,Still we shall find them; though much do I fear they already have passed it.
346,HERMANN,"Shouldst thou have linen to spare of any description, provided"
347,HERMANN,"Thou of this neighborhood art, to the poor in charity give it.'"
348,HERMANN,
349,HERMANN,"""Thus she spoke, and the pale-faced mother raised herself feebly"
350,HERMANN,"Up from the straw, and towards me looked. Then said I in answer:"
351,HERMANN,"'Surely unto the good, a spirit from heaven oft speaketh,"
352,HERMANN,Making them feel the distress that threatens a suffering brother.
353,HERMANN,"For thou must know that my mother, already presaging thy sorrows,"
354,HERMANN,"Gave me a bundle to use it straightway for the need of the naked,'"
355,HERMANN,"Then I untied the knots of the string, and the wrapper of father's"
356,HERMANN,"Unto her gave, and gave her as well the shirts and the linen."
357,HERMANN,"And she thanked me with joy, and cried: 'The happy believe not"
358,HERMANN,Miracles yet can be wrought: for only in need we acknowledge
359,HERMANN,"God's own hand and finger, that leads the good to show goodness,"
360,HERMANN,"What unto us he has done through thee, may he do to thee also!"
361,HERMANN,"And I beheld with what pleasure the sick woman handled the linens,"
362,HERMANN,But with especial delight the dressing-gown's delicate flannel.
363,HERMANN,"'Let us make haste,' the maid to her said, 'and come to the village,"
364,HERMANN,Where our people will halt for the night and already are resting.
365,HERMANN,"There these clothes for the children I, one and all, straightway will portion.'"
366,HERMANN,"Then she saluted again, her thanks most warmly expressing,"
367,HERMANN,"Started the oxen; the wagon went on; but there I still lingered,"
368,HERMANN,Still held the horses in check; for now my heart was divided
369,HERMANN,"Whether to drive with speed to the village, and there the provisions"
370,HERMANN,"Share 'mong the rest of the people, or whether I here to the maiden"
371,HERMANN,"All should deliver at once, for her discreetly to portion."
372,HERMANN,"And in an instant my heart had decided, and quietly driving"
373,HERMANN,"After the maiden, I soon overtook her, and said to her quickly:"
374,HERMANN,"'Hearken, good maiden;--my mother packed up not linen-stuffs only"
375,HERMANN,"Into the carriage, that I should have clothes to furnish the naked;"
376,HERMANN,"Wine and beer she added besides, and supply of provisions:"
377,HERMANN,Plenty of all these things I have in the box of the carriage.
378,HERMANN,But now I feel myself moved to deliver these offerings also
379,HERMANN,Into thy hand; for so shall I best fulfil my commission.
380,HERMANN,"Thou wilt divide them with judgment, while I must by chance be directed.'"
381,HERMANN,Thereupon answered the maiden: 'I will with faithfulness portion
382,HERMANN,"These thy gifts, that all shall bring comfort to those who are needy.'"
383,HERMANN,"Thus she spoke, and quickly the box of the carriage I opened,"
384,HERMANN,"Brought forth thence the substantial hams, and brought out the breadstuffs,"
385,HERMANN,"Bottles of wine and beer, and one and all gave to the maiden."
386,HERMANN,"Willingly would I have given her more, but the carriage was empty."
387,HERMANN,"All she packed at the sick woman's feet, and went on her journey."
388,HERMANN,"I, with my horses and carriage, drove rapidly back to the city."""
389,HERMANN,
390,HERMANN,"Instantly now, when Hermann had ceased, the talkative neighbor"
391,HERMANN,"Took up the word, and cried: ""Oh happy, in days like the present,"
392,HERMANN,"Days of flight and confusion, who lives by himself in his dwelling,"
393,HERMANN,Having no wife nor child to be clinging about him in terror!
394,HERMANN,"Happy I feel myself now, and would not for much be called father;"
395,HERMANN,"Would not have wife and children to-day, for whom to be anxious."
396,HERMANN,Oft have I thought of this flight before; and have packed up together
397,HERMANN,"All my best things already, the chains and old pieces of money"
398,HERMANN,"That were my sainted mother's, of which not one has been sold yet."
399,HERMANN,"Much would be left behind, it is true, not easily gotten."
400,HERMANN,"Even the roots and the herbs, that were with such industry gathered,"
401,HERMANN,"I should be sorry to lose, though the worth of the goods is but trifling."
402,HERMANN,"If my purveyor remained, I could go from my dwelling contented."
403,HERMANN,"When my cash I have brought away safe, and have rescued my person,"
404,HERMANN,"All is safe: none find it so easy to fly as the single."""
405,HERMANN,
406,HERMANN,"""Neighbor,"" unto his words young Hermann with emphasis answered:"
407,HERMANN,"""I can in no wise agree with thee here, and censure thy language."
408,HERMANN,"Is he indeed a man to be prized, who, in good and in evil,"
409,HERMANN,"Takes no thought but for self, and gladness and sorrow with others"
410,HERMANN,"Knows not how to divide, nor feels his heart so impel him?"
411,HERMANN,Rather than ever to-day would I make up my mind to be married:
412,HERMANN,"Many a worthy maiden is needing a husband's protection,"
413,HERMANN,"And the man needs an inspiriting wife when ill is impending."""
414,HERMANN,
415,HERMANN,"Thereupon smiling the father replied: ""Thus love I to hear thee!"
416,HERMANN,"That is a sensible word such as rarely I've known thee to utter."""
417,HERMANN,"Straightway, however, the mother broke in with quickness, exclaiming:"
418,HERMANN,"""Son, to be sure, thou art right! we parents have set the example;"
419,HERMANN,Seeing that not in our season of joy did we choose one another;
420,HERMANN,Rather the saddest of hours it was that bound us together.
421,HERMANN,Monday morning--I mind it well; for the day that preceded
422,HERMANN,Came that terrible fire by which our city was ravaged--
423,HERMANN,Twenty years will have gone. The day was a Sunday as this is;
424,HERMANN,Hot and dry was the season; the water was almost exhausted.
425,HERMANN,"All the people were strolling abroad in their holiday dresses,"
426,HERMANN,"'Mong the villages partly, and part in the mills and the taverns."
427,HERMANN,"And at the end of the city the flames began, and went coursing"
428,HERMANN,"Quickly along the streets, creating a draught in their passage."
429,HERMANN,Burned were the barns where the copious harvest already was garnered;
430,HERMANN,"Burned were the streets as far as the market; the house of my father,"
431,HERMANN,"Neighbor to this, was destroyed, and this one also fell with it."
432,HERMANN,"Little we managed to save. I sat, that sorrowful night through,"
433,HERMANN,"Outside the town on the common, to guard the beds and the boxes."
434,HERMANN,"Sleep overtook me at last, and when I again was awakened,"
435,HERMANN,"Feeling the chill of the morning that always descends before sunrise,"
436,HERMANN,"There were the smoke and the glare, and the walls and chimneys in ruins."
437,HERMANN,Then fell a weight on my heart; but more majestic than ever
438,HERMANN,"Came up the sun again, inspiring my bosom with courage."
439,HERMANN,"Then I rose hastily up, with a yearning the place to revisit"
440,HERMANN,"Whereon our dwelling had stood, and to see if the hens had been rescued,"
441,HERMANN,"Which I especially loved, for I still was a child in my feelings."
442,HERMANN,Thus as I over the still-smoking timbers of house and of court-yard
443,HERMANN,"Picked my way, and beheld the dwelling so ruined and wasted,"
444,HERMANN,"Thou camest up to examine the place, from the other direction."
445,HERMANN,Under the ruins thy horse in his stall had been buried; the rubbish
446,HERMANN,Lay on the spot and the glimmering beams; of the horse we saw nothing.
447,HERMANN,"Thoughtful and grieving we stood there thus, each facing the other,"
448,HERMANN,Now that the wall was fallen that once had divided our court-yards.
449,HERMANN,"Thereupon thou by the hand didst take me, and speak to me, saying,--"
450,HERMANN,"'Lisa, how earnest thou hither? Go back! thy soles must be burning;"
451,HERMANN,"Hot the rubbish is here: it scorches my boots, which are stronger.'"
452,HERMANN,"And thou didst lift me up, and carry me out through thy court-yard."
453,HERMANN,"There was the door of the house left standing yet with its archway,"
454,HERMANN,"Just as 'tis standing now, the one thing only remaining."
455,HERMANN,Then thou didst set me down and kiss me; to that I objected;
456,HERMANN,But thou didst answer and say with kindly significant language:
457,HERMANN,'See! my house lies in ruins: remain here and help me rebuild it;
458,HERMANN,So shall my help in return be given to building thy father's.'
459,HERMANN,Yet did I not comprehend thee until thou sentest thy mother
460,HERMANN,"Unto my father, and quick were the happy espousals accomplished."
461,HERMANN,"E'en to this day I remember with joy those half-consumed timbers,"
462,HERMANN,And I can see once more the sun coming up in such splendor;
463,HERMANN,"For 'twas the day that gave me my husband; and, ere the first season"
464,HERMANN,"Passed of that wild desolation, a son to my youth had been given."
465,HERMANN,"Therefore I praise thee, Hermann, that thou, with an honest assurance,"
466,HERMANN,"Shouldst, in these sorrowful days, be thinking thyself of a maiden,"
467,HERMANN,"And amid ruins and war shouldst thus have the courage to woo her."""
468,HERMANN,
469,HERMANN,"Straightway, then, and with warmth, the father replied to her, saying:"
470,HERMANN,"""Worthy of praise is the feeling, and truthful also the story,"
471,HERMANN,"Mother, that thou hast related; for so indeed everything happened."
472,HERMANN,"Better, however, is better. It is not the business of all men"
473,HERMANN,Thus their life and estate to begin from the very foundation:
474,HERMANN,Every one needs not to worry himself as we and the rest did.
475,HERMANN,"Oh, how happy is he whose father and mother shall give him,"
476,HERMANN,"Furnished and ready, a house which he can adorn with his increase."
477,HERMANN,Every beginning is hard; but most the beginning a household.
478,HERMANN,"Many are human wants, and every thing daily grows dearer,"
479,HERMANN,So that a man must consider the means of increasing his earnings.
480,HERMANN,"This I hope therefore of thee, my Hermann, that into our dwelling"
481,HERMANN,Thou wilt be bringing ere long a bride who is handsomely dowered;
482,HERMANN,For it is meet that a gallant young man have an opulent maiden.
483,HERMANN,"Great is the comfort of home whene'er, with the woman elected,"
484,HERMANN,"Enter the useful presents, besides, in box and in basket."
485,HERMANN,Not for this many a year in vain has the mother been busy
486,HERMANN,Making her daughter's linens of strong and delicate texture;
487,HERMANN,"God-parents have not in vain been giving their vessels of silver,"
488,HERMANN,And the father laid by in his desk the rare pieces of money;
489,HERMANN,"For there a day will come when she, with her gifts and possessions,"
490,HERMANN,Shall that youth rejoice who has chosen her out of all others.
491,HERMANN,"Well do I know how good in a house is a woman's position,"
492,HERMANN,"Who her own furniture round her knows, in kitchen and chamber;"
493,HERMANN,Who herself the bed and herself the table has covered.
494,HERMANN,Only a well-dowered bride should I like to receive to my dwelling.
495,HERMANN,"She who is poor is sure, in the end, to be scorned by her husband;"
496,HERMANN,"And will as servant be held, who as servant came in with her bundle."
497,HERMANN,Men will remain unjust when the season of love is gone over.
498,HERMANN,"Yes, my Hermann, thy father's old age thou greatly canst gladden,"
499,HERMANN,"If thou a daughter-in-law will speedily bring to my dwelling,"
500,HERMANN,"Out of the neighborhood here,--from the house over yonder, the green one."
501,HERMANN,"Rich is the man, I can tell thee. His manufactures and traffic"
502,HERMANN,Daily are making him richer; for whence draws the merchant not profit?
503,HERMANN,"Three daughters only he has, to divide his fortune among them."
504,HERMANN,True that the eldest already is taken; but there is the second
505,HERMANN,"Still to be had, as well as the third; and not long so, it may be."
506,HERMANN,"I would never have lingered till now, had I been in thy place;"
507,HERMANN,"But had fetched one of the maidens, as once I bore off thy dear mother."""
508,HERMANN,Modestly then did the son to the urgent father answer;
509,HERMANN,"""Truly 'twas my wish too, as well as thine own, to have chosen"
510,HERMANN,"One of our neighbor's daughters, for we had been brought up together;"
511,HERMANN,"Played, in the early days, about the market-place fountain;"
512,HERMANN,"And, from the other boys' rudeness, I often have been their defender."
513,HERMANN,"That, though, is long since past: the girls, as they grew to be older,"
514,HERMANN,"Properly stayed in the house, and shunned the more boisterous pastimes."
515,HERMANN,"Well brought up are they, surely! I used sometimes to go over,"
516,HERMANN,"Partly to gratify thee, and because of our former acquaintance:"
517,HERMANN,But no pleasure I ever could take in being among them;
518,HERMANN,For I was always obliged to endure their censures upon me.
519,HERMANN,"Quite too long was my coat, the cloth too coarse, and the color"
520,HERMANN,"Quite too common; my hair was not cropped, as it should be, and frizzled."
521,HERMANN,"I was resolved, at last, that I, also, would dress myself finely,"
522,HERMANN,"Just as those office-boys do who always are seen there on Sundays,"
523,HERMANN,"Wearing in summer their half-silken flaps, that dangled about them;"
524,HERMANN,"But I discovered, betimes, they made ever a laughing-stock of me."
525,HERMANN,"And I was vexed when I saw it,--it wounded my pride; but more deeply"
526,HERMANN,Felt I aggrieved that they the good-will should so far misinterpret
527,HERMANN,"That in my heart I bore them,--especially Minna the youngest."
528,HERMANN,It was on Easter-day that last I went over to see them;
529,HERMANN,"Wearing my best new coat, that is now hanging up in the closet,"
530,HERMANN,"And having frizzled my hair, like that of the other young fellows."
531,HERMANN,"Soon as I entered, they tittered; but that not at me, as I fancied."
532,HERMANN,"Minna before the piano was seated; the father was present,"
533,HERMANN,"Hearing his daughters sing, and full of delight and good-humor."
534,HERMANN,Much I could not understand of all that was said in the singing;
535,HERMANN,"But of Pamina I often heard, and oft of Tamino:"
536,HERMANN,"And I, besides, could not stay there dumb; so, as soon as she ended,"
537,HERMANN,"Something about the words I asked, and about the two persons."
538,HERMANN,Thereupon all were silent and smiled; but the father made answer:
539,HERMANN,"'Thou knowest no one, my friend, I believe, but Adam and Eve?'"
540,HERMANN,"No one restrained himself longer, but loud laughed out then the maidens,"
541,HERMANN,"Loud laughed out the boys, the old man held his sides for his laughing."
542,HERMANN,"I, in embarrassment, dropped my hat, and the giggling continued,"
543,HERMANN,"On and on and on, for all they kept playing and singing."
544,HERMANN,"Back to the house here I hurried, o'ercome with shame and vexation,"
545,HERMANN,"Hung up my coat in the closet, and pulled out the curls with my fingers,"
546,HERMANN,Swearing that never again my foot should cross over that threshold.
547,HERMANN,"And I was perfectly right; for vain are the maidens, and heartless."
548,HERMANN,"E'en to this day, as I hear, I am called by them ever 'Tamino.'"""
549,HERMANN,
550,HERMANN,"Thereupon answered the mother, and said: ""Thou shouldest not, Hermann,"
551,HERMANN,"Be so long vexed with the children: indeed, they are all of them children."
552,HERMANN,"Minna, believe me, is good, and was always disposed to thee kindly."
553,HERMANN,"'Twas not long since she was asking about thee. Let her be thy chosen!"""
554,HERMANN,
555,HERMANN,"Thoughtfully answered the son: ""I know not. That mortification"
556,HERMANN,"Stamped itself in me so deeply, I never could bear to behold her"
557,HERMANN,"Seated before the piano or listen again to her singing."""
558,HERMANN,
559,HERMANN,"Forth broke the father then, and in words of anger made answer:"
560,HERMANN,"""Little of joy will my life have in thee! I said it would be so"
561,HERMANN,When I perceived that thy pleasure was solely in horses and farming:
562,HERMANN,"Work which a servant, indeed, performs for an opulent master,"
563,HERMANN,"That thou doest; the father meanwhile must his son be deprived of,"
564,HERMANN,"Who should appear as his pride, in the sight of the rest of the townsmen."
565,HERMANN,"Early with empty hopes thy mother was wont to deceive me,"
566,HERMANN,"When in the school thy studies, thy reading and writing, would never"
567,HERMANN,"As with the others succeed, but thy seat would be always the lowest."
568,HERMANN,"That comes about, forsooth, when a youth has no feeling of honor"
569,HERMANN,"Dwelling within his breast, nor the wish to raise himself higher."
570,HERMANN,Had but my father so cared for me as thou hast been cared for;
571,HERMANN,"If he had sent me to school, and provided me thus with instructors,"
572,HERMANN,"I should be other, I trow, than host of the Golden Lion!"""
573,HERMANN,
574,HERMANN,"Then the son rose from his seat and noiselessly moved to the doorway,"
575,HERMANN,"Slowly, and speaking no word. The father, however; in passion"
576,HERMANN,"After him called, ""Yes, go, thou obstinate fellow! I know thee!"
577,HERMANN,"Go and look after the business henceforth, that I have not to chide thee;"
578,HERMANN,But do thou nowise imagine that ever a peasant-born maiden
579,HERMANN,"Thou for a daughter-in-law shalt bring into my dwelling, the hussy!"
580,HERMANN,"Long have I lived in the world, and know how mankind should be dealt with;"
581,HERMANN,Know how to entertain ladies and gentlemen so that contented
582,HERMANN,"They shall depart from my house, and strangers agreeably can flatter."
583,HERMANN,"Yet I'm resolved that some day I one will have for a daughter,"
584,HERMANN,Who shall requite me in kind and sweeten my manifold labors;
585,HERMANN,"Who the piano shall play to me, too; so that there shall with pleasure"
586,HERMANN,"All the handsomest people in town and the finest assemble,"
587,HERMANN,"As they on Sundays do now in the house of our neighbor."" Here Hermann"
588,HERMANN,"Softly pressed on the latch, and so went out from the chamber."
589,HERMANN,
590,HERMANN,
591,HERMANN,
592,HERMANN,
593,THALIA,THALIA
594,THALIA,
595,THE CITIZENS,THE CITIZENS
596,THE CITIZENS,
597,THE CITIZENS,Thus did the modest son slip away from the angry upbraiding;
598,THE CITIZENS,"But in the tone he had taken at first, the father continued:"
599,THE CITIZENS,"""That comes not out of a man which he has not in him; and hardly"
600,THE CITIZENS,Shall the joy ever be mine of seeing my dearest wish granted:
601,THE CITIZENS,"That my son may not as his father be, but a better."
602,THE CITIZENS,"What would become of the house, and what of the city if each one"
603,THE CITIZENS,"Were not with pleasure and always intent on maintaining, renewing,"
604,THE CITIZENS,"Yea, and improving, too, as time and the foreigner teach us!"
605,THE CITIZENS,"Man is not meant, forsooth, to grow from the ground like a mushroom,"
606,THE CITIZENS,"Quickly to perish away on the spot of ground that begot him,"
607,THE CITIZENS,Leaving no trace behind of himself and his animate action!
608,THE CITIZENS,"As by the house we straightway can tell the mind of the master,"
609,THE CITIZENS,"So, when we walk through a city, we judge of the persons who rule it."
610,THE CITIZENS,For where the towers and walls are falling to ruin; where offal
611,THE CITIZENS,"Lies in heaps in the gutters, and alleys with offal are littered;"
612,THE CITIZENS,"Where from its place has started the stone, and no one resets it;"
613,THE CITIZENS,"Where the timbers are rotting away, and the house is awaiting"
614,THE CITIZENS,"Vainly its new supports,--that place we may know is ill governed."
615,THE CITIZENS,"Since if not from above work order and cleanliness downward,"
616,THE CITIZENS,Easily grows the citizen used to untidy postponement;
617,THE CITIZENS,Just as the beggar grows likewise used to his ragged apparel.
618,THE CITIZENS,Therefore I wished that our Hermann might early set out on some travels;
619,THE CITIZENS,"That he at least might behold the cities of Strasburg and Frankfort,"
620,THE CITIZENS,"Friendly Mannheim, too, that is cheerful and evenly builded."
621,THE CITIZENS,"He that has once beheld cities so cleanly and large, never after"
622,THE CITIZENS,"Ceases his own native city, though small it may be, to embellish."
623,THE CITIZENS,"Do not the strangers who come here commend the repairs in our gateway,"
624,THE CITIZENS,"Notice our whitewashed tower, and the church we have newly rebuilded?"
625,THE CITIZENS,"Are not all praising our pavement? the covered canals full of water,"
626,THE CITIZENS,"Laid with a wise distribution, which furnish us profit and safety,"
627,THE CITIZENS,So that no sooner does fire break out than 'tis promptly arrested?
628,THE CITIZENS,Has not all this come to pass since the time of our great conflagration?
629,THE CITIZENS,"Builder I six times was named by the council, and won the approval,"
630,THE CITIZENS,"Won moreover the heartfelt thanks of all the good burghers,"
631,THE CITIZENS,"Actively carrying out what I planned, and also fulfilling"
632,THE CITIZENS,"What had by upright men been designed, and left uncompleted."
633,THE CITIZENS,Finally grew the same zeal in every one of the council;
634,THE CITIZENS,"All now labor together, and firmly decided already"
635,THE CITIZENS,Stands it to build the new causeway that shall with the highroad connect us.
636,THE CITIZENS,But I am sorely afraid that will not be the way with our children.
637,THE CITIZENS,Some think only of pleasure and perishable apparel;
638,THE CITIZENS,"Others will cower at home, and behind the stove will sit brooding."
639,THE CITIZENS,"One of this kind, as I fear, we shall find to the last in our Hermann."""
640,THE CITIZENS,
641,THE CITIZENS,Straightway answered and said the good and intelligent mother:
642,THE CITIZENS,"""Why wilt thou always, father, be doing our son such injustice?"
643,THE CITIZENS,That least of all is the way to bring thy wish to fulfilment.
644,THE CITIZENS,We have no power to fashion our children as suiteth our fancy;
645,THE CITIZENS,"As they are given by God, we so must have them and love them;"
646,THE CITIZENS,"Teach them as best we can, and let each of them follow his nature."
647,THE CITIZENS,"One will have talents of one sort, and different talents another."
648,THE CITIZENS,"Every one uses his own; in his own individual fashion,"
649,THE CITIZENS,Each must be happy and good. I will not have my Hermann found fault with;
650,THE CITIZENS,"For he is worthy, I know, of the goods he shall one day inherit;"
651,THE CITIZENS,"Will be an excellent landlord, a pattern to burghers and builders;"
652,THE CITIZENS,"Neither in council, as I can foresee, will he be the most backward."
653,THE CITIZENS,"But thou keepest shut up in his breast all the poor fellow's spirit,"
654,THE CITIZENS,"Finding such fault with him daily, and censuring as thou but now hast."""
655,THE CITIZENS,"And on the instant she quitted the room, and after him hurried,"
656,THE CITIZENS,"Hoping she somewhere might find him, and might with her words of affection"
657,THE CITIZENS,"Cheer him again, her excellent son, for well he deserved it."
658,THE CITIZENS,
659,THE CITIZENS,"Thereupon when she was gone, the father thus smiling continued:"
660,THE CITIZENS,"""What a strange folk, to be sure, are these women; and just like the children;"
661,THE CITIZENS,"Both of them bent upon living according as suiteth their pleasure,"
662,THE CITIZENS,While we others must never do aught but flatter and praise them.
663,THE CITIZENS,Once for all time holds good the ancients' trustworthy proverb:
664,THE CITIZENS,"'Whoever goes not forward comes backward.' So must it be always."""
665,THE CITIZENS,
666,THE CITIZENS,"Thereupon answered and said, in a tone of reflection, the doctor:"
667,THE CITIZENS,"""That, sir neighbor, I willingly grant; for myself I am always"
668,THE CITIZENS,"Casting about for improvement,--things new, so they be not too costly."
669,THE CITIZENS,"But what profits a man, who has not abundance of money,"
670,THE CITIZENS,"Being thus active and stirring, and bettering inside and outside?"
671,THE CITIZENS,"Only too much is the citizen cramped: the good, though he know it,"
672,THE CITIZENS,"Has he no means to acquire because too slender his purse is,"
673,THE CITIZENS,While his needs are too great; and thus is he constantly hampered.
674,THE CITIZENS,Many the things I had done; but then the cost of such changes
675,THE CITIZENS,"Who does not fear, especially now in this season of danger?"
676,THE CITIZENS,Long since my house was smiling upon me in modish apparel!
677,THE CITIZENS,Long since great panes of glass were gleaming in all of the windows!
678,THE CITIZENS,"But who can do as the merchant does, who, with his resources,"
679,THE CITIZENS,Knows the methods as well by which the best is arrived at?
680,THE CITIZENS,"Look at that house over yonder,--the new one; behold with what splendor"
681,THE CITIZENS,'Gainst the background of green stand out the white spirals of stucco!
682,THE CITIZENS,"Great are the panes in the windows; and how the glass sparkles and glitters,"
683,THE CITIZENS,Casting quite into the shade the rest of the market-place houses!
684,THE CITIZENS,"Yet just after the fire were our two houses the finest,"
685,THE CITIZENS,"This of the Golden Lion, and mine of the sign of the Angel."
686,THE CITIZENS,"So was my garden, too, throughout the whole neighborhood famous:"
687,THE CITIZENS,"Every traveller stopped and gazed through the red palisadoes,"
688,THE CITIZENS,Caught by the beggars there carved in stone and the dwarfs of bright colors.
689,THE CITIZENS,"Then whosoever had coffee served in the beautiful grotto,--"
690,THE CITIZENS,"Standing there now all covered with dust and Partly in ruins,--"
691,THE CITIZENS,Used to be mightily pleased with the glimmering light of the mussels
692,THE CITIZENS,Spread out in beautiful order; and even the eye of the critic
693,THE CITIZENS,Used by the sight of my corals and potter's ore to be dazzled.
694,THE CITIZENS,"So in my parlor, too, they would always admire the painting,"
695,THE CITIZENS,"Where in a garden are gaily dressed ladies and gentlemen walking,"
696,THE CITIZENS,And with their taper fingers are plucking and holding the flowers.
697,THE CITIZENS,"But who would look at it now! In sooth, so great my vexation"
698,THE CITIZENS,"Scarcely I venture abroad. All now must be other and tasteful,"
699,THE CITIZENS,So they call it; and white are the laths and benches of wood-work;
700,THE CITIZENS,Everything simple and smooth; no carving longer or gilding
701,THE CITIZENS,"Can be endured, and the woods from abroad are of all the most costly."
702,THE CITIZENS,"Well, I too should be glad could I get for myself something novel;"
703,THE CITIZENS,"Glad to keep up with the times, and be changing my furniture often;"
704,THE CITIZENS,Yet must we all be afraid of touching the veriest trifle.
705,THE CITIZENS,For who among us has means for paying the work-people's wages
706,THE CITIZENS,"Lately I had an idea of giving the Archangel Michael,"
707,THE CITIZENS,"Making the sign of my shop, another fresh coating of gilding,"
708,THE CITIZENS,And to the terrible dragon about his feet that is winding;
709,THE CITIZENS,"But I e'en let him stay browned as he is: I dreaded the charges."""

717,MOTHER AND SON,
718,MOTHER AND SON,"Thus entertaining themselves, the men sat talking. The mother"
719,MOTHER AND SON,"Went meanwhile to look for her son in front of the dwelling,"
720,MOTHER AND SON,"First on the settle of stone, whereon 'twas his wont to be seated."
721,MOTHER AND SON,"When she perceived him not there, she went farther to look in the stable,"
722,MOTHER AND SON,"If he were caring perhaps for his noble horses, the stallions,"
723,MOTHER AND SON,"Which he as colts had bought, and whose care he intrusted to no one."
724,MOTHER AND SON,And by the servant she there was told: He is gone to the garden.
725,MOTHER AND SON,"Then with a nimble step she traversed the long, double courtyards,"
726,MOTHER AND SON,"Leaving the stables behind, and the well-builded barns, too, behind her;"
727,MOTHER AND SON,"Entered the garden, that far as the walls of the city extended;"
728,MOTHER AND SON,"Walked through its length, rejoiced as she went in every thing growing;"
729,MOTHER AND SON,Set upright the supports on which were resting the branches
730,MOTHER AND SON,"Heavily laden with apples, and burdening boughs of the pear-tree."
731,MOTHER AND SON,"Next some caterpillars removed from a stout, swelling cabbage;"
732,MOTHER AND SON,For an industrious woman allows no step to be wasted.
733,MOTHER AND SON,"Thus was she come at last to the end of the far-reaching garden,"
734,MOTHER AND SON,"Where stood the arbor embowered in woodbine; nor there did she find him,"
735,MOTHER AND SON,More than she had hitherto in all her search through the garden.
736,MOTHER AND SON,"But the wicket was standing ajar, which out of the arbor,"
737,MOTHER AND SON,"Once by particular favor, had been through the walls of the city"
738,MOTHER AND SON,"Cut by a grandsire of hers, the worshipful burgomaster."
739,MOTHER AND SON,"So the now dried-up moat she next crossed over with comfort,"
740,MOTHER AND SON,"Where, by the side of the road, direct the well-fenced vineyard,"
741,MOTHER AND SON,"Rose with a steep ascent, its slope exposed to the sunshine."
742,MOTHER AND SON,"Up this also she went, and with pleasure as she was ascending"
743,MOTHER AND SON,"Marked the wealth of the clusters, that scarce by their leafage were hidden."
744,MOTHER AND SON,"Shady and covered the way through the lofty middlemost alley,"
745,MOTHER AND SON,Which upon steps that were made of unhewn blocks you ascended.
746,MOTHER AND SON,"There were the Muscatel, and there were the Chasselas hanging"
747,MOTHER AND SON,"Side by side, of unusual size and colored with purple,"
748,MOTHER AND SON,All set out with the purpose of decking the visitor's table;
749,MOTHER AND SON,"While with single vine-stocks the rest of the hillside was covered,"
750,MOTHER AND SON,"Bearing inferior clusters, from which the delicate wine comes."
751,MOTHER AND SON,"Thus up the slope she went, enjoying already the vintage,"
752,MOTHER AND SON,"And that festive day on which the whole country, rejoicing,"
753,MOTHER AND SON,"Picks and tramples the grapes, and gathers the must into vessels:"
754,MOTHER AND SON,"Fireworks, when it is evening, from every direction and corner"
755,MOTHER AND SON,"Crackle and blaze, and so the fairest of harvests is honored."
756,MOTHER AND SON,"But more uneasy she went, her son after twice or thrice calling,"
757,MOTHER AND SON,"And no answer receiving, except from the talkative echo,"
758,MOTHER AND SON,That with many repeats rang back from the towers of the city.
759,MOTHER AND SON,
760,MOTHER AND SON,Strange it was for her to seek him; he never had gone to a distance
761,MOTHER AND SON,"That he told her not first, to spare his affectionate mother"
762,MOTHER AND SON,"Every anxious thought, and fear that aught ill had befallen."
763,MOTHER AND SON,"Still did she constantly hope that, if further she went, she should find him;"
764,MOTHER AND SON,"For the two doors of the vineyard, the lower as well as the upper,"
765,MOTHER AND SON,"Both were alike standing open. So now she entered the cornfield,"
766,MOTHER AND SON,That with its broad expanse the ridge of the hill covered over.
767,MOTHER AND SON,"Still was the ground that she walked on her own; and the crops she rejoiced in,--"
768,MOTHER AND SON,"All of them still were hers, and hers was the proud-waving grain, too,"
769,MOTHER AND SON,Over the whole broad field in golden strength that was stirring.
770,MOTHER AND SON,"Keeping the ridgeway, the footpath, between the fields she went onward,"
771,MOTHER AND SON,"Having the lofty pear-tree in view, which stood on the summit,"
772,MOTHER AND SON,And was the boundary-mark of the fields that belonged to her dwelling.
773,MOTHER AND SON,"Who might have planted it, none could know, but visible was it"
774,MOTHER AND SON,Far and wide through the country; the fruit of the pear-tree was famous.
775,MOTHER AND SON,"'Neath it the reapers were wont to enjoy their meal at the noon-day,"
776,MOTHER AND SON,And the shepherds were used to tend their flocks in its shadow.
777,MOTHER AND SON,Benches of unhewn stones and of turf they found set about it.
778,MOTHER AND SON,"And she had not been mistaken, for there sat her Hermann, and rested,--"
779,MOTHER AND SON,"Sat with his head on his hand, and seemed to be viewing the landscape"
780,MOTHER AND SON,That to the mountains lay: his back was turned to his mother.
781,MOTHER AND SON,"Towards him softly she crept, and lightly touched on the shoulder;"
782,MOTHER AND SON,Quick he turned himself round: there were tears in his eyes as he met her.
783,MOTHER AND SON,
784,MOTHER AND SON,"""Mother, how hast thou surprised me!"" he said in confusion; and quickly"
785,MOTHER AND SON,"Wiped the high-spirited youth his tears away. But the mother,"
786,MOTHER AND SON,"""What! do I find thee weeping, my son?"" exclaimed in amazement."
787,MOTHER AND SON,"""Nay, that is not like thyself: I never before have so seen thee!"
788,MOTHER AND SON,"Tell me, what burdens thy heart? what drives thee here, to be sitting"
789,MOTHER AND SON,"Under the pear-tree alone? These tears in thine eyes, what has brought them?"""
790,MOTHER AND SON,
791,MOTHER AND SON,"Then, collecting himself, the excellent youth made her answer:"
792,MOTHER AND SON,"""Truly no heart can that man have in his bosom of iron,"
793,MOTHER AND SON,Who is insensible now to the needs of this emigrant people;
794,MOTHER AND SON,"He has no brains in his head, who not for his personal safety,"
795,MOTHER AND SON,"Not for his fatherland's weal, in days like the present is anxious."
796,MOTHER AND SON,Deeply my heart had been touched by the sights and sounds of the morning;
797,MOTHER AND SON,Then I went forth and beheld the broad and glorious landscape
798,MOTHER AND SON,"Spreading its fertile slopes in every direction about us,"
799,MOTHER AND SON,"Saw the golden grain inclining itself to the reapers,"
800,MOTHER AND SON,And the promise of well-filled barns from the plentiful harvest.
801,MOTHER AND SON,"But, alas, how near is the foe! The Rhine with its waters"
802,MOTHER AND SON,"Guards us, indeed; but, ah, what now are rivers and mountains"
803,MOTHER AND SON,'Gainst that terrible people that onward bears like a tempest!
804,MOTHER AND SON,"For they summon their youths from every quarter together,"
805,MOTHER AND SON,"Call up their old men too, and press with violence forward."
806,MOTHER AND SON,Death cannot frighten the crowd: one multitude follows another.
807,MOTHER AND SON,And shall a German dare to linger behind in his homestead?
808,MOTHER AND SON,Hopes he perhaps to escape the everywhere threatening evil?
809,MOTHER AND SON,"Nay, dear mother, I tell thee, to-day has made me regretful"
810,MOTHER AND SON,"That I was lately exempt, when out of our townsmen were chosen"
811,MOTHER AND SON,"Those who should serve in the army. An only son I am truly,"
812,MOTHER AND SON,"Also our business is great, and the charge of our household is weighty."
813,MOTHER AND SON,"Yet were it better, I deem, in the front to offer resistance"
814,MOTHER AND SON,"There on the border, than here to await disaster and bondage."
815,MOTHER AND SON,"So has my spirit declared, and deep in my innermost bosom"
816,MOTHER AND SON,"Courage and longing have now been aroused to live for my country,"
817,MOTHER AND SON,"Yea, and to die, presenting to others a worthy example."
818,MOTHER AND SON,If but the strength of Germany's youth were banded together
819,MOTHER AND SON,"There on the frontier, resolved that it never would yield to the stranger,"
820,MOTHER AND SON,"Ah, he should not on our glorious soil be setting his foot-steps,"
821,MOTHER AND SON,"Neither consuming before our eyes the fruit of our labor,"
822,MOTHER AND SON,"Ruling our men, and making his prey of our wives and our daughters."
823,MOTHER AND SON,"Hark to me, mother: for I in the depths of my heart am determined"
824,MOTHER AND SON,"Quickly to do, and at once, what appears to me right and in reason;"
825,MOTHER AND SON,For he chooses not always the best who longest considers.
826,MOTHER AND SON,"Hearken, I shall not again return to the house; but directly"
827,MOTHER AND SON,"Go from this spot to the city, and there present to the soldiers"
828,MOTHER AND SON,"This right arm and this heart, to be spent in the fatherland's service."
829,MOTHER AND SON,Then let my father say if there be no feeling of honor
830,MOTHER AND SON,"Dwelling within my breast, nor a wish to raise myself higher."""
831,MOTHER AND SON,"Then with significant words spoke the good and intelligent mother,"
832,MOTHER AND SON,While from her eyes the quick-starting tears were silently falling:
833,MOTHER AND SON,"""Son, what change has come o'er thee to-day, and over thy temper,"
834,MOTHER AND SON,"That thou speakest no more, as thou yesterday didst, and hast always,"
835,MOTHER AND SON,"Open and free, to thy mother, and tellest exactly thy wishes?"
836,MOTHER AND SON,"Any one else, had he heard thee thus speak, would in sooth have commended,"
837,MOTHER AND SON,"And this decision of thine would have highly approved as most noble,"
838,MOTHER AND SON,Being misled by thy tone and by thy significant language.
839,MOTHER AND SON,Yet have I nothing but censure to speak; for better I know thee.
840,MOTHER AND SON,"Thou concealest thy heart, and thy thoughts are not such as thou tellest."
841,MOTHER AND SON,"Well do I know that it is not the drum, not the trumpet that calls thee:"
842,MOTHER AND SON,Neither in uniform wouldst thou figure in sight of the maidens;
843,MOTHER AND SON,"Since, for all thou art honest and brave, it is thy vocation"
844,MOTHER AND SON,Here in quiet to care for the farm and provide for the household.
845,MOTHER AND SON,"Tell me honestly, therefore, what goads thee to such a decision?"""
846,MOTHER AND SON,
847,MOTHER AND SON,"Earnestly answered the son: ""Nay, thou art mistaken, dear mother:"
848,MOTHER AND SON,One day is not like another. The youth matures into manhood:
849,MOTHER AND SON,Better in stillness oft ripening to deeds than when in the tumult
850,MOTHER AND SON,"Wildering and wild of existence, that many a youth has corrupted."
851,MOTHER AND SON,"And, for as still as I am and was always, there yet in my bosom"
852,MOTHER AND SON,Has such a heart been shaped as abhors all wrong and injustice;
853,MOTHER AND SON,And I have learned aright between worldly things to distinguish.
854,MOTHER AND SON,"Arm and foot, besides, have been mightily strengthened by labor."
855,MOTHER AND SON,"All this, I feel, is true: I dare with boldness maintain it."
856,MOTHER AND SON,"Yet dost thou blame me with reason, O mother! for thou hast surprised me"
857,MOTHER AND SON,Using a language half truthful and half that of dissimulation.
858,MOTHER AND SON,"For, let me honestly own,--it is not the near danger that calls me"
859,MOTHER AND SON,Forth from my father's house; nor is it the lofty ambition
860,MOTHER AND SON,"Helpful to be to my country, and terrible unto the foeman."
861,MOTHER AND SON,They were but words that I spoke: they only were meant for concealing
862,MOTHER AND SON,Those emotions from thee with which my heart is distracted;
863,MOTHER AND SON,"And so leave me, O mother! for, since the wishes are fruitless"
864,MOTHER AND SON,"Which in my bosom I cherish, my life must go fruitlessly over."
865,MOTHER AND SON,"For, as I know, he injures himself who is singly devoted,"
866,MOTHER AND SON,"When for the common cause the whole are not working together."""
867,MOTHER AND SON,
868,MOTHER AND SON,"""Hesitate not,"" replied thereupon the intelligent mother,"
869,MOTHER AND SON,"""Every thing to relate me, the smallest as well as the greatest."
870,MOTHER AND SON,"Men will always be hasty, their thoughts to extremes ever running:"
871,MOTHER AND SON,Easily out of their course the hasty are turned by a hindrance.
872,MOTHER AND SON,"Whereas a woman is clever in thinking of means, and will venture"
873,MOTHER AND SON,"E'en on a roundabout way, adroitly to compass her object."
874,MOTHER AND SON,"Let me know every thing, then; say wherefore so greatly excited"
875,MOTHER AND SON,"'As I ne'er saw thee before, why thy blood is coursing so hotly,"
876,MOTHER AND SON,"Wherefore, against thy will, tears are filling thine eyes to o'erflowing."""
877,MOTHER AND SON,
878,MOTHER AND SON,"Then he abandoned himself, the poor boy, to his sorrow, and weeping,"
879,MOTHER AND SON,"Weeping aloud on his kind mother's breast, he brokenly answered:"
880,MOTHER AND SON,"""Truly my father's words to-day have wounded me sorely,--"
881,MOTHER AND SON,"Words which I have not deserved; not to-day, nor at any time have I:"
882,MOTHER AND SON,For it was early my greatest delight to honor my parents.
883,MOTHER AND SON,"No one knew more, so I deemed, or was wiser than those who begot me,"
884,MOTHER AND SON,And had with strictness ruled throughout the dark season of childhood.
885,MOTHER AND SON,"Many the things, in truth, I with patience endured from my playmates,"
886,MOTHER AND SON,When the good-will that I bore them they often requited with malice.
887,MOTHER AND SON,Often I suffered their flings and their blows to pass unresented;
888,MOTHER AND SON,"But if they ventured to ridicule father, when he of a Sunday"
889,MOTHER AND SON,"Home from Church would come, with his solemn and dignified bearing;"
890,MOTHER AND SON,"If they made fun of his cap-string, or laughed at the flowers of the wrapper"
891,MOTHER AND SON,"He with such stateliness wore, which was given away but this morning,--"
892,MOTHER AND SON,Threateningly doubled my fist in an instant; with furious passion
893,MOTHER AND SON,"Fell I upon them, and struck out and hit, assailing them blindly,"
894,MOTHER AND SON,Seeing not where. They howled as the blood gushed out from their noses:
895,MOTHER AND SON,Scarcely they made their escape from my passionate kicking and beating.
896,MOTHER AND SON,"Then, as I older grew, I had much to endure from my father;"
897,MOTHER AND SON,"Violent words he oft vented on me, instead of on others,"
898,MOTHER AND SON,"When, at the board's last session, the council had roused his displeasure,"
899,MOTHER AND SON,And I was made to atone for the quarrels and wiles of his colleagues.
900,MOTHER AND SON,"Thou has pitied me often thyself; for much did I suffer,"
901,MOTHER AND SON,"Ever remembering with cordial respect the kindness of parents,"
902,MOTHER AND SON,"Solely intent on increasing for us their goods and possessions,"
903,MOTHER AND SON,Much denying themselves in order to save for their children.
904,MOTHER AND SON,"But, alas! saving alone, for the sake of a tardy enjoyment,--"
905,MOTHER AND SON,"That is not happiness: pile upon pile, and acre on acre,"
906,MOTHER AND SON,"Make us not happy, no matter how fair our estates may be rounded."
907,MOTHER AND SON,"For the father grows old, and with him will grow old the children,"
908,MOTHER AND SON,"Losing the joy of the day, and bearing the care of tomorrow."
909,MOTHER AND SON,"Look thou below, and see how before us in glory are lying,"
910,MOTHER AND SON,"Fair and abundant, the corn-fields; beneath them, the vineyard and garden;"
911,MOTHER AND SON,Yonder the stables and barns; our beautiful line of possessions.
912,MOTHER AND SON,"But when I look at the dwelling behind, where up in the gable"
913,MOTHER AND SON,We can distinguish the window that marks my room in the attic;
914,MOTHER AND SON,"When I look back, and remember how many a night from that window"
915,MOTHER AND SON,"I for the moon have watched; for the sun, how many a morning!"
916,MOTHER AND SON,"When the healthful sleep of a few short hours sufficed me,--"
917,MOTHER AND SON,"Ah, so lonely they seem to me then, the chamber and courtyard,"
918,MOTHER AND SON,"Garden and glorious field, away o'er the hill that is stretching;"
919,MOTHER AND SON,"All so desert before me lie: 'tis the wife that is wanting."""
920,MOTHER AND SON,
921,MOTHER AND SON,"Thereupon spoke the good mother, and thus with intelligence answered:"
922,MOTHER AND SON,"""Son, not greater thy wish to bring thee a bride to thy chamber,"
923,MOTHER AND SON,"That thou mayst find thy nights a beautiful part of existence,"
924,MOTHER AND SON,"And that the work of the day may gain independence and freedom,"
925,MOTHER AND SON,"Than is thy father's wish too, and thy mother's. We always have counselled,--"
926,MOTHER AND SON,"Yea, we have even insisted,--that thou shouldst select thee a maiden."
927,MOTHER AND SON,"But I was ever aware, and now my heart gives me assurance,"
928,MOTHER AND SON,"That till the hour appointed is come, and the maiden appointed"
929,MOTHER AND SON,"Shall with the hour appear, the choice will be left for the future,"
930,MOTHER AND SON,While more strong than all else will be fear of grasping the wrong one.
931,MOTHER AND SON,"If I may say it, my son, I believe thou already hast chosen;"
932,MOTHER AND SON,"For thy heart has been touched, and been made more than wontedly tender."
933,MOTHER AND SON,"Speak it out honestly, then; for my soul has told me beforehand:"
934,MOTHER AND SON,"That same maiden it is, the exile, whom thou hast elected."""
935,MOTHER AND SON,
936,MOTHER AND SON,"""Thou has said, mother!"" the son thereupon with eagerness answered."
937,MOTHER AND SON,"""Yes, it is she; and if I to-day as my bride do not bring her"
938,MOTHER AND SON,"Home to our dwelling, she from me will go, perhaps vanish for ever,"
939,MOTHER AND SON,Lost in the war's confusion and sad movings hither and thither.
940,MOTHER AND SON,"Mother, for ever in vain would then our abundant possessions"
941,MOTHER AND SON,"Prosper before me, and seasons to come be in vain to me fruitful."
942,MOTHER AND SON,"Yea, I should hold in aversion the wonted house and the garden:"
943,MOTHER AND SON,"Even my mother's love, alas! would not comfort my sorrow."
944,MOTHER AND SON,"Every tie, so I feel in my heart, by love is unloosened"
945,MOTHER AND SON,Soon as she fastens her own; and not the maid is it only
946,MOTHER AND SON,"Leaves behind father and mother, to follow the man she has chosen."
947,MOTHER AND SON,"He too, the youth, no longer knows aught of mother and father,"
948,MOTHER AND SON,"When he the maiden, his only beloved, sees vanishing from him."
949,MOTHER AND SON,"Suffer me, then, to go hence wherever despair shall impel me:"
950,MOTHER AND SON,Since by my father himself the decisive words have been spoken;
951,MOTHER AND SON,"Since his house can no longer be mine if he shut out the maiden,"
952,MOTHER AND SON,"Her whom alone as my bride I desire to bring to our dwelling."""
953,MOTHER AND SON,
954,MOTHER AND SON,Thereupon quickly made answer the good and intelligent mother:
955,MOTHER AND SON,"""How like to rocks, forsooth, two men will stand facing each other!"
956,MOTHER AND SON,"Proud and not to be moved, will neither draw near to his fellow;"
957,MOTHER AND SON,Neither will stir his tongue to utter the first word of kindness.
958,MOTHER AND SON,"Therefore I tell thee, my son, a hope yet lives in my bosom,"
959,MOTHER AND SON,"So she be honest and good, thy father will let thee espouse her,"
960,MOTHER AND SON,"Even though poor, and against a poor girl so decisive his sentence."
961,MOTHER AND SON,Many a thing he is wont to speak out in his violent fashion
962,MOTHER AND SON,Which he yet never performs; and so what he denies will consent to.
963,MOTHER AND SON,"Yet he requires a kindly word, and is right to require it: He is the father!"
964,MOTHER AND SON,"Besides we know that his wrath after dinner,--"
965,MOTHER AND SON,"When he most hastily speaks, and questions all others' opinions,--"
966,MOTHER AND SON,Signifies naught; the full force of his violent will is excited
967,MOTHER AND SON,"Then by the wine, which lets him not heed the language of others;"
968,MOTHER AND SON,"None but himself does he see and feel. But now is come evening,"
969,MOTHER AND SON,Talk upon various subjects has passed between him and his neighbors.
970,MOTHER AND SON,"Gentle, he is; I am sure now his little excitement is over,"
971,MOTHER AND SON,And he can feel how unjust his passion has made him to others.
972,MOTHER AND SON,"Come, let us venture at once: success is alone to the valiant!"
973,MOTHER AND SON,"Further we need the friends, still sitting together there with him;"
974,MOTHER AND SON,"And in especial the worthy pastor will give us assistance."""
975,MOTHER AND SON,
976,MOTHER AND SON,"Thus she hastily spoke, and up from the stone then arising,"
977,MOTHER AND SON,"Drew from his seat her son, who willingly followed. In silence"
978,MOTHER AND SON,"Both descended the hill, their important purpose revolving."

988,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"With mine host of the Lion, the village doctor, and pastor;"
989,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"And their talk was still on the same unvarying subject,"
990,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Turning it this way and that, and viewing from every direction."
991,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,But with his sober judgment the excellent pastor made answer:

993,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Striving for that which is better; indeed, as we see, he is reaching"

995,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"But be careful ye go not too far, for with this disposition"
996,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Nature has given us pleasure in holding to what is familiar;
997,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Taught us in that to delight to which we have long been accustomed.

1003,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Ever untiring to roam; who takes delight in the riches,"
1004,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Heaping in generous abundance about himself and his children.
1005,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Yet not unprized by me is the quiet citizen also,"
1006,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Making the noiseless round of his own inherited acres,"
1007,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Tilling the ground as the ever-returning seasons command him.
1008,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Not with every year is the soil transfigured about him;
1009,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Not in haste does the tree stretch forth, as soon as 'tis planted,"
1010,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Full-grown arms towards heaven and decked with plenteous blossoms.
1011,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"No: man has need of patience, and needful to him are also"
1012,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Calmness and clearness of mind, and a pure and right understanding."
1013,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Few are the seeds he intrusts to earth's all-nourishing bosom;
1014,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Few are the creatures he knows how to raise and bring to perfection.
1015,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Centred are all his thoughts alone on that which is useful.
1016,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Happy to whom by nature a mind of such temper is given,"
1017,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"For he supports us all! And hail, to the man whose abode is"
1018,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Where in a town the country pursuits with the city are blended.
1019,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"On him lies not the pressure that painfully hampers the farmer,"
1020,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Nor is he carried away by the greedy ambition of cities;
1021,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Where they of scanty possessions too often are given to aping,"
1022,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Wives and daughters especially, those who are higher and richer."
1023,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Blessed be therefore thy son in his life of quiet employment;
1024,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Blessed the wife, of like mind with himself, whom he one day shall choose him."""
1025,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,
1026,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Thus he spoke; and scarce had he ended when entered the mother,"
1027,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Holding her son by the hand, and so led him up to her husband."
1028,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"""Father,"" she said, ""how oft when we two have been chatting together,"
1029,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Have we rejoiced in the thought of Hermann's future espousal,"
1030,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,When he should bring his bride to be the light of our dwelling!
1031,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Over and over again the matter we pondered: this maiden
1032,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Fixing upon for him first, and then that, with the gossip of parents."
1033,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,But that day is now come; and Heaven at last has the maiden
1034,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Brought to him hither, and shown him; and now his heart has decided."
1035,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Said we not always then he should have his own choice in the matter?
1036,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Was it not just now thy wish that he might with lively affection
1037,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Feel himself drawn to some maiden? The hour is come that we hoped for.
1038,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Yes; he has felt and has chosen and come to a manly decision.
1039,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"That same maiden it is that met him this morning, the stranger:"
1040,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Say he may have her, or else, as he swears, his life shall be single."""
1041,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,
1042,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"""Give her me, father,"" so added the son: ""my heart has elected"
1043,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Clear and sure; she will be to you both the noblest of daughters."""
1044,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,
1045,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"But the father was silent. Then hastily rose the good pastor,"
1046,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Took up the word and said: ""The moment alone is decisive;"
1047,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Fixes the life of man, and his future destiny settles."
1048,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"After long taking of counsel, yet only the work of a moment"
1049,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Every decision must be; and the wise alone seizes the right one.
1050,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Dangerous always it is comparing the one with the other
1051,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"When we are making our choice, and so confusing our feelings."
1052,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Hermann is pure. From childhood up I have known him, and never"
1053,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,E'en as a boy was he wont to be reaching for this and the other:
1054,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"What he desired was best for him too, and he held to it firmly."
1055,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Be not surprised and alarmed that now has appeared of a sudden,"
1056,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,What thou hast wished for so long. It is true that the present appearance
1057,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Bears not the form of the wish, exactly as thou hadst conceived it:"
1058,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,For our wishes oft hide from ourselves the object we wish for;
1059,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Gifts come down from above in the shapes appointed by Heaven.
1060,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Therefore misjudge not the maiden who now of thy dearly beloved,"
1061,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Good and intelligent son has been first to touch the affections:
1062,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Happy to whom at once his first love's hand shall be given,"
1063,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,And in whose heart no tenderest wish must secretly languish.
1064,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Yes: his whole bearing assures me that now his fate is decided.
1065,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Genuine love matures in a moment the youth into manhood;
1066,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"He is not easily moved; and I fear that if this be refused him,"
1067,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Sadly his years will go by, those years that should be the fairest,"""
1068,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,
1069,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Straightway then in a thoughtful tone the doctor made answer,"
1070,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,On whose tongue for a long time past the words had been trembling:
1071,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"""Pray let us here as before pursue the safe middle course only."
1072,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Make haste slowly: that was Augustus the emperor's motto.
1073,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Willingly I myself place at my well-beloved neighbor's disposal,"
1074,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Ready to do him what service I can with my poor understanding.
1075,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Youth most especially stands in need of some one to guide it.
1076,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Let me therefore go forth that I may examine the maiden,"
1077,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,And may question the people among whom she lives and who know her.
1078,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Me 'tis not easy to cheat: I know how words should be valued."""
1079,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,
1080,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Straightway the son broke in, and with wing'ed words made he answer:"
1081,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"""Do so, neighbor, and go and make thine inquiries; but with thee"
1082,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,I should be glad if our minister here were joined in the errand:
1083,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Two such excellent men would be irreproachable judges.
1084,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"O my father! believe me, she's none of those wandering maidens,"
1085,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Not one of those who stroll through the land in search of adventure,"
1086,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,And who seek to ensnare inexperienced youth in their meshes.
1087,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"No: the hard fortunes of war, that universal destroyer,"
1088,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Which is convulsing the earth and has hurled from its deep foundations
1089,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Many a structure already, have sent the poor girl into exile."
1090,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Are not now men of high birth, the most noble, in misery roaming?"
1091,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Princes fly in disguise and kings are in banishment living.
1092,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"So alas! also is she, the best among all of her sisters,"
1093,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Driven an exile from home; yet, her personal sorrows forgetting,"
1094,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"She is devoted to others; herself without help, she is helpful."
1095,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Great is the want and the suffering over the earth that are spreading:
1096,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Shall not some happiness, too, be begotten of all this affliction,"
1097,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"And shall not I in the arms of my wife, my trusted companion,"
1098,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Look back with joy to the war, as do ye to the great conflagration?"""
1099,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,
1100,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Outspoke the father then in a tone of decision, and answered:"
1101,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"""Strangely thy tongue has been loosened, my son, which many a year past"
1102,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Seemed to have stuck in thy mouth, and only to move on compulsion!"
1103,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"I must experience to-day, it would seem, what threatens all fathers,"
1104,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"That the son's headstrong will the mother with readiness favors,"
1105,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Showing too easy indulgence; and every neighbor sides with them
1106,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,When there is aught to be carried against the father and husband.
1107,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"But I will not oppose you, thus banded together: how could I?"
1108,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,For I already perceive here tears and defiance beforehand.
1109,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Go ye therefore, inquire, in God's name, bring me the daughter."
1110,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"But if not so, then the boy is to think no more of the maiden."""
1111,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,
1112,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Thus the father. The son cried out with joyful demeanor,"
1113,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"""Ere it is evening the noblest of daughters shall hither be brought you,"
1114,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Such as no man with sound sense in his breast can fail to be pleased with.
1115,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Happy, I venture to hope, will be also the excellent maiden."
1116,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Yes; she will ever be grateful for having had father and mother
1117,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Given once more in you, and such as a child most delights in."
1118,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Now I will tarry no longer, but straightway harness the horses,"
1119,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Drive forth our friends at once on the footsteps of my beloved,"
1120,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Leaving them then to act for themselves, as their wisdom shall dictate,"
1121,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Guide myself wholly, I promise, according to what they determine,"
1122,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"And, until I may call her my own, ne'er look on the maiden."""
1123,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Thus he went forth: the others meanwhile remained in discussion,"
1124,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Rapid and earnest, considering deeply their great undertaking."
1125,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,
1126,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Hermann hasted straightway to the stable, where quietly standing"
1127,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Found he the spirited stallions, the clean oats quickly devouring,"
1128,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,And the well-dried hay that was cut from the richest of meadows.
1129,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"On them without delay the shining bits he adjusted,"
1130,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Hastily drew the straps through the buckles of beautiful plating,"
1131,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Firmly fastened then the long broad reins, and the horses"
1132,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Led without to the court-yard, whither the willing assistant"
1133,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Had with ease, by the pole, already drawn forward the carriage."
1134,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Next to the whipple-tree they with care by the neatly kept traces
1135,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Joined the impetuous strength of the freely travelling horses.
1136,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Whip in hand took Hermann his seat and drove under the doorway.
1137,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Soon as the friends straightway their commodious places had taken,"
1138,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Quickly the carriage rolled off, and left the pavement behind it,"
1139,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Left behind it the walls of the town and the fresh-whitened towers.
1140,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Thus drove Hermann on till he came to the well-known causeway.
1141,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Rapidly, loitering nowhere, but hastening up hill and down hill."
1142,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"But as he now before him perceived the spire of the village,"
1143,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"And no longer remote the garden-girt houses were lying,"
1144,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Then in himself he thought that here he would rein up the horses.
1145,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,
1146,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Under the solemn shade of lofty linden-trees lying,"
1147,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Which for centuries past upon this spot had been rooted,"
1148,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Spread in front of the village a broad and grass-covered common,"
1149,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Favorite place of resort for the peasants and neighboring townsfolk.
1150,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Here, at the foot of the trees, sunk deep in the ground was a well-spring;"
1151,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"When you descended the steps, stone benches you found at the bottom,"
1152,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Stationed about the spring, whose pure, living waters were bubbling"
1153,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Ceaselessly forth, hemmed in by low walls for convenience of drawing."
1154,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Hermann resolved that here he would halt, with his horses and carriage,"
1155,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Under the shade of the trees. He did so, and said to the others;"
1156,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"""Here alight, my friends, and go your ways to discover"
1157,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Whether the maiden in truth be worthy the hand that I offer.
1158,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"That, she is so, I believe; naught new or strange will ye tell me."
1159,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Had I to act for myself, I should go with speed to the village,"
1160,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Where a few words from the maiden's own lips should determine my fortune.
1161,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Ye will with readiness single her out from all of the others,"
1162,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,For there can scarcely be one that to her may be likened in bearing.
1163,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"But I will give you, besides, her modest attire for a token:"
1164,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Mark, then, the stomacher's scarlet, that sets off the arch of her bosom,"
1165,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Prettily laced, and the bodice of black fitting close to her figure;"
1166,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Neatly the edge of her kerchief is plaited into a ruffle,"
1167,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Which with a simple grace her chin's rounded outline encircles;
1168,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Freely and lightly rises above it the head's dainty oval;
1169,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,And her luxuriant hair over silver bodkins is braided;
1170,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Down from under her bodice, the full, blue petticoat falling,"
1171,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Wraps itself, when she is walking, about her neatly shaped ankles."
1172,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Yet one thing will I say, and would make it my earnest petition,--"
1173,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Speak not yourselves with the maiden, nor let your intent be discovered;"
1174,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Rather inquire of others, and hearken to what they may tell you."
1175,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"When ye have tidings enough to satisfy father and mother,"
1176,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Then return to me here, and we will consider what further."
1177,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"So did I plan it all out in my mind while driving you hither."""
1178,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,
1179,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Thus he spoke. The friends thereupon went their way to the village,"
1180,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Where, in the houses and gardens and barns, the people were swarming;"
1181,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Wagons on wagons stood crowded together along the broad highway.
1182,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Men for the harnessed horses and lowing cattle were caring,"
1183,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"While the women were busy in drying their clothes on the hedges,"
1184,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,And in the running brook the children were merrily splashing.
1185,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Making their way through the pressure of wagons, of people and cattle,"
1186,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Went the commissioned spies, and to right and to left looked about them,"
1187,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,If they a figure might see that answered the maiden's description;
1188,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,But not one of them all appeared the beautiful damsel.
1189,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Denser soon grew the press. A contest arose round the wagons
1190,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"'Mongst the threatening men, wherein blended the cries of the women."
1191,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Rapidly then to the spot, and with dignified step, came an elder,"
1192,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Joined the clamoring group, and straightway the uproar was silenced,"
1193,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"As he commanded peace, and rebuked with a fatherly sternness."
1194,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"""Has, then, misfortune,"" he cried, ""not yet so bound us together,"
1195,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"That we have finally learned to bear and forbear one another,"
1196,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Though each one, it may be, do not measure his share of the labor?"
1197,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"He that is happy, forsooth, is contentious! Will sufferings never"
1198,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Teach you to cease from your brawls of old between brother and brother?
1199,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Grudge not one to another a place on the soil of the stranger;
1200,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Rather divide what ye have, as yourselves, ye would hope to find mercy."""
1201,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,
1202,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Thus spoke the man and all became silent: restored to good humor,"
1203,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Peaceably then the people arranged their cattle and wagons.
1204,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"But when the clergyman now had heard what was said by the stranger,"
1205,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"And had the steadfast mind of the foreign justice discovered,"
1206,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,He to the man drew near and with words of meaning addressed him:
1207,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"""True it is, father, that when in prosperity people are living,"
1208,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Feeding themselves from the earth, which far and wide opens her bosom,"
1209,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"And in the years and months renews the coveted blessings,--"
1210,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"All goes on of itself, and each himself deems the wisest,"
1211,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Deems the best, and so they continue abiding together,"
1212,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,He of greatest intelligence ranking no higher than others;
1213,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"All that occurs, as if of itself, going quietly forward."
1214,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"But let disaster unsettle the usual course of existence,"
1215,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Tear down the buildings about us, lay waste the crops and the garden,"
1216,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Banish the husband and wife from their old, familiar-grown dwelling,"
1217,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Drive them to wander abroad through nights and days of privation,--"
1218,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Then, ah then! we look round us to see what man is the wisest,"
1219,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,And no longer in vain his glorious words will be spoken.
1220,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Tell me, art thou not judge among this fugitive people,"
1221,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Father, who thus in an instant canst bid their passions be quiet?"
1222,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Thou dost appear to-day as one of those earliest leaders,"
1223,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Who through deserts and wanderings guided the emigrant nations.
1224,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Yea, I could even believe I were speaking with Joshua or Moses."""
1225,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,
1226,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Then with serious look the magistrate answered him, saying:"
1227,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"""Truly our times might well be compared with all others in strangeness,"
1228,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Which are in history mentioned, profane or sacred tradition;"
1229,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"For who has yesterday lived and to-day in times like the present,"
1230,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"He has already lived years, events are so crowded together."
1231,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"If I look back but a little, it seems that my head must be hoary"
1232,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Under the burden of years, and yet my strength is still active."
1233,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Well may we of this day compare ourselves unto that people
1234,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Who, from the burning bush, beheld in the hour of their danger"
1235,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"God the Lord: we also in cloud and in fire have beheld him."""
1236,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,
1237,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Seeing the priest was inclined to speak yet more with the stranger,"
1238,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"And was desirous of learning his story and that of his people,"
1239,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,Privately into his ear his companion hastily whispered:
1240,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"""Talk with the magistrate further, and lead him to speak of the maiden."
1241,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"I, however, will wander in search, and as soon as I find her,"
1242,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"Come and report to thee here."" The minister nodded, assenting;"
1243,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,"And through the gardens, hedges, and barns, went the spy on his errand."
1244,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,
1245,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,
1246,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,
1247,THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,
1248,CLIO,CLIO
1249,CLIO,
1250,THE AGE,THE AGE
1251,THE AGE,
1252,THE AGE,Now when the foreign judge had been by the minister questioned
1253,THE AGE,"As to his people's distress, and how long their exile had lasted,"
1254,THE AGE,"Thus made answer the man: ""Of no recent date are our sorrows;"
1255,THE AGE,"Since of the gathering bitter of years our people have drunken,--"
1256,THE AGE,Bitterness all the more dreadful because such fair hope had been blighted.
1257,THE AGE,"Who will pretend to deny that his heart swelled high in his bosom,"
1258,THE AGE,And that his freer breast with purer pulses was beating;
1259,THE AGE,"When we beheld the new sun arise in his earliest splendor,"
1260,THE AGE,"When of the rights of men we heard, which to all should be common,"
1261,THE AGE,"Were of a righteous equality told, and inspiriting freedom?"
1262,THE AGE,"Every one hoped that then he should live his own life, and the fetters,"
1263,THE AGE,"Binding the various lands, appeared their hold to be loosing,--"
1264,THE AGE,Fetters that had in the hand of sloth been held and self-seeking.
1265,THE AGE,"Looked not the eyes of all nations, throughout that calamitous season,"
1266,THE AGE,"Towards the world's capital city, for so it had long been considered,"
1267,THE AGE,"And of that glorious title was now, more than ever, deserving?"
1268,THE AGE,
1269,THE AGE,"""Were not the names of those men who first delivered the message,"
1270,THE AGE,Names to compare with the highest that under the heavens are spoken?
1271,THE AGE,"Did not, in every man, grow courage and spirit and language?"
1272,THE AGE,"And, as neighbors, we, first of all, were zealously kindled."
1273,THE AGE,"Thereupon followed the war, and armed bodies of Frenchmen"
1274,THE AGE,Pressed to us nearer; yet nothing but friendship they seemed to be bringing;
1275,THE AGE,"Ay, and they brought it too; for exalted the spirit within them:"
1276,THE AGE,"They with rejoicing the festive trees of liberty planted,"
1277,THE AGE,"Promising every man what was his own, and to each his own ruling."
1278,THE AGE,"High beat the heart of the youths, and even the aged were joyful;"
1279,THE AGE,Gaily the dance began about the newly raised standard.
1280,THE AGE,"Thus had they speedily won, these overmastering Frenchmen,"
1281,THE AGE,"First the spirits of men by the fire and dash of their bearing,"
1282,THE AGE,Then the hearts of the women with irresistible graces.
1283,THE AGE,"Even the pressure of hungry war seemed to weigh on us lightly,"
1284,THE AGE,"So before our vision did hope hang over the future,"
1285,THE AGE,Luring our eyes abroad into newly opening pathways.
1286,THE AGE,"Oh, how joyful the time when with her belov'ed the maiden"
1287,THE AGE,"Whirls in the dance, the longed-for day of their union awaiting!"
1288,THE AGE,But more glorious that day on which to our vision the highest
1289,THE AGE,Heart of man can conceive seemed near and attainable to us.
1290,THE AGE,"Loosened was every tongue, and men--the aged, the stripling--"
1291,THE AGE,Spoke aloud in words that were full of high feeling and wisdom.
1292,THE AGE,"Soon, however, the sky was o'ercast. A corrupt generation"
1293,THE AGE,"Fought for the right of dominion, unworthy the good to establish;"
1294,THE AGE,"So that they slew one another, their new-made neighbors and brothers"
1295,THE AGE,"Held in subjection, and then sent the self-seeking masses against us."
1296,THE AGE,"Chiefs committed excesses and wholesale plunder upon us,"
1297,THE AGE,While those lower plundered and rioted down to the lowest:
1298,THE AGE,Every one seemed but to care that something be left for the morrow.
1299,THE AGE,"Great past endurance the need, and daily grew the oppression:"
1300,THE AGE,They were the lords of the day; there was none to hear our complaining.
1301,THE AGE,Then fell trouble and rage upon even the quietest spirit.
1302,THE AGE,"One thought only had all, and swore for their wrongs to have vengeance,"
1303,THE AGE,And for the bitter loss of their hope thus doubly deluded.
1304,THE AGE,"Presently Fortune turned and declared on the side of the German,"
1305,THE AGE,And with hurried marches the French retreated before us.
1306,THE AGE,Ah! then as never before did we feel the sad fortunes of warfare:
1307,THE AGE,"He that is victor is great and good,--or at least he appears SO,--"
1308,THE AGE,"And he, as one of his own, will spare the man he has conquered,"
1309,THE AGE,"Him whose service he daily needs, and whose property uses."
1310,THE AGE,"But no law the fugitive knows, save of self-preservation,"
1311,THE AGE,"And, with a reckless greed, consumes all the possessions about him;"
1312,THE AGE,Then are his passions also inflamed: the despair that is in him
1313,THE AGE,"Out of his heart breaks forth, and takes shape in criminal action."
1314,THE AGE,Nothing is further held sacred; but all is for plunder. His craving
1315,THE AGE,"Turns in fury on woman, and pleasure is changed into horror."
1316,THE AGE,"Death he sees everywhere round him, and madly enjoys his last moments,"
1317,THE AGE,
1318,THE AGE,"""Taking delight in blood, in the shrieking of anguish exulting."
1319,THE AGE,Thereupon fiercely arose in our men the stern resolution
1320,THE AGE,"What had been lost to avenge, and defend whate'er was remaining,"
1321,THE AGE,"Every man sprang to his arms, by the flight of the foeman encouraged,"
1322,THE AGE,"And by his blanching cheeks, and his timorous, wavering glances."
1323,THE AGE,Ceaselessly now rang out the clanging peal of the tocsin.
1324,THE AGE,Thought of no danger to come restrained their furious anger.
1325,THE AGE,Quick into weapons of war the husbandman's peaceful utensils
1326,THE AGE,All were converted; dripped with blood the scythe and the ploughshare.
1327,THE AGE,Quarter was shown to none: the enemy fell without mercy.
1328,THE AGE,Fury everywhere raged and the cowardly cunning of weakness.
1329,THE AGE,Ne'er may I men so carried away by injurious passion
1330,THE AGE,See again! the sight of the raging wild beast would be better.
1331,THE AGE,"Let not man prattle of freedom, as if himself he could govern!"
1332,THE AGE,"Soon as the barriers are torn away, then all of the evil"
1333,THE AGE,"Seems let loose, that by law had been driven deep back into corners."""
1334,THE AGE,
1335,THE AGE,"""Excellent man!"" thereupon with emphasis answered the pastor:"
1336,THE AGE,"""Though thou misjudgest mankind, yet can I not censure thee for it."
1337,THE AGE,"Evil enough, I confess, thou hast had to endure from man's passions,"
1338,THE AGE,"Yet wouldst thou look behind over this calamitous season,"
1339,THE AGE,Thou wouldst acknowledge thyself how much good thou also hast witnessed.
1340,THE AGE,"How many excellent things that would in the heart have hidden,"
1341,THE AGE,"Had not danger aroused them, and did not necessity's pressure"
1342,THE AGE,"Bring forth the angel in man, and make him a god of deliv'rance."""
1343,THE AGE,
1344,THE AGE,"Thereupon answered and said the reverend magistrate, smiling:"
1345,THE AGE,"""There thou remindest me aptly of how we console the poor fellow,"
1346,THE AGE,"After his house has been burned, by recounting the gold and the silver"
1347,THE AGE,"Melted and scattered abroad in the rubbish, that still is remaining."
1348,THE AGE,"Little enough, it is true; but even that little is precious."
1349,THE AGE,Then will the poor wretch after it dig and rejoice if he find it.
1350,THE AGE,Thus I likewise with happier thoughts will gratefully turn me
1351,THE AGE,Towards the few beautiful deeds of which I preserve the remembrance.
1352,THE AGE,"Yes, I will not deny, I have seen old quarrels forgotten,"
1353,THE AGE,"Ill to avert from the state; I also have witnessed how friendship,"
1354,THE AGE,"Love of parent and child, can impossibilities venture;"
1355,THE AGE,Seen how the stripling at once matured into man; how the aged
1356,THE AGE,"Grew again young; and even the child into youth was developed,"
1357,THE AGE,"Yea, and the weaker sex too, as we are accustomed to call it,"
1358,THE AGE,Showed itself brave and strong and ready for every emergence.
1359,THE AGE,"Foremost among them all, one beautiful deed let me mention,"
1360,THE AGE,"Bravely performed by the hand of a girl, an excellent maiden;"
1361,THE AGE,"Who, with those younger than she, had been left in charge of a farmhouse,"
1362,THE AGE,"Since there, also, the men had marched against the invader."
1363,THE AGE,"Suddenly fell on the house a fugitive band of marauders,"
1364,THE AGE,"Eager for booty, who crowded straightway to the room of the women."
1365,THE AGE,
1366,THE AGE,"""There they beheld the beautiful form of the fully grown maiden,"
1367,THE AGE,"Looked on the charming young girls, who rather might still be called children."
1368,THE AGE,Savage desire possessed them; at once with merciless passion
1369,THE AGE,They that trembling band assailed and the high-hearted maiden.
1370,THE AGE,"But she had snatched in an instant the sword of one from its scabbard,"
1371,THE AGE,"Felled him with might to the ground, and stretched him bleeding before her."
1372,THE AGE,"Then with vigorous strokes she bravely delivered the maidens,"
1373,THE AGE,Smiting yet four of the robbers; who saved themselves only by flying.
1374,THE AGE,"Then she bolted the gates, and, armed, awaited assistance."""
1375,THE AGE,
1376,THE AGE,"Now when this praise the minister heard bestowed on the maiden,"
1377,THE AGE,"Rose straightway for his friend a feeling of hope in his bosom,"
1378,THE AGE,"And he had opened his lips to inquire what further befell her,"
1379,THE AGE,If on this mournful flight she now with her people were present;
1380,THE AGE,"When with a hasty step the village doctor approached them,"
1381,THE AGE,"Twitched the clergyman's coat, and said in his ear in a whisper:"
1382,THE AGE,"""I have discovered the maiden at last among several hundreds;"
1383,THE AGE,"By the description I knew her, so come, let thine own eyes behold her!"
1384,THE AGE,"Bring too the magistrate with thee, that so we may hear him yet further."""
1385,THE AGE,"But as they turned to go, the justice was summoned to leave them,"
1386,THE AGE,Sent for by some of his people by whom his counsel was needed.
1387,THE AGE,
1388,THE AGE,"Straightway the preacher, however, the lead of the doctor had followed"
1389,THE AGE,Up to a gap in the fence where his finger he meaningly pointed.
1390,THE AGE,"""Seest thou the maiden?"" he said: ""she has made some clothes for the baby"
1391,THE AGE,"Out of the well-known chintz,--I distinguish it plainly; and further"
1392,THE AGE,There are the covers of blue that Hermann gave in his bundle.
1393,THE AGE,"Well and quickly, forsooth, she has turned to advantage the presents."
1394,THE AGE,"Evident tokens are these, and all else answers well the description."
1395,THE AGE,"Mark how the stomacher's scarlet sets off the arch of her bosom,"
1396,THE AGE,"Prettily laced, and the bodice of black fits close to her figure;"
1397,THE AGE,"Neatly the edge of her kerchief is plaited into a ruffle,"
1398,THE AGE,"Which, with a simple grace, her chin's rounded outline encircles;"
1399,THE AGE,"Freely and lightly rises above it the bead's dainty oval,"
1400,THE AGE,And her luxuriant hair over silver bodkins is braided.
1401,THE AGE,"Now she is sitting, yet still we behold her majestical stature,"
1402,THE AGE,"And the blue petticoat's ample plaits, that down from her bosom"
1403,THE AGE,"Hangs in abundant folds about her neatly shaped ankles,"
1404,THE AGE,"She without question it is; come, therefore, and let us discover"
1405,THE AGE,"Whether she honest and virtuous be, a housewifely maiden."""
1406,THE AGE,
1407,THE AGE,"Then, as the seated figure he studied, the pastor made answer:"
1408,THE AGE,"""Truly, I find it no wonder that she so enchanted the stripling,"
1409,THE AGE,"Since, to a man's experienced eye, she seems lacking in nothing."
1410,THE AGE,Happy to whom mother Nature a shape harmonious has given!
1411,THE AGE,
1412,THE AGE,"""Such will always commend him, and he can be nowhere a stranger."
1413,THE AGE,"All approach with delight, and all are delighted to linger,"
1414,THE AGE,If to the outward shape correspond but a courteous spirit.
1415,THE AGE,"I can assure thee, in her the youth has found him a maiden,"
1416,THE AGE,"Who, in the days to come, his life shall gloriously brighten,"
1417,THE AGE,Standing with womanly strength in every necessity by him.
1418,THE AGE,"Surely the soul must be pure that inhabits a body so perfect,"
1419,THE AGE,"And of a happy old age such vigorous youth is the promise."""
1420,THE AGE,
1421,THE AGE,Thereupon answered and said the doctor in language of caution:
1422,THE AGE,"""Often appearances cheat; I like not to trust to externals."
1423,THE AGE,For I have oft seen put to the test the truth of the proverb:
1424,THE AGE,"Till thou a bushel of salt with a new acquaintance hast eaten,"
1425,THE AGE,Be not too ready to trust him; for time alone renders thee certain
1426,THE AGE,"How ye shall fare with each other, and how well your friendship shall prosper."
1427,THE AGE,Let us then rather at first make inquiries among the good people
1428,THE AGE,"By whom the maiden is known, and who can inform us about her."""
1429,THE AGE,
1430,THE AGE,"""Much I approve of thy caution,"" the preacher replied as he followed."
1431,THE AGE,"""Not for ourselves is the suit, and 'tis delicate wooing for others."""
1432,THE AGE,
1433,THE AGE,"Towards the good magistrate, then, the men directed their footsteps,"
1434,THE AGE,Who was again ascending the street in discharge of his duties.
1435,THE AGE,
1436,THE AGE,Him the judicious pastor at once addressed and with caution.
1437,THE AGE,"""Look! we a maiden have here descried in the neighboring garden,"
1438,THE AGE,"Under an apple-tree sitting, and making up garments for children"
1439,THE AGE,
1440,THE AGE,"""Out of second-hand stuff that somebody doubtless has given;"
1441,THE AGE,And we were pleased with her aspect: she seems like a girl to be trusted.
1442,THE AGE,"Tell us whatever thou knowest: we ask it with honest intentions."""
1443,THE AGE,
1444,THE AGE,"Soon as the magistrate nearer had come, and looked into the garden,"
1445,THE AGE,"""Her thou knowest already,"" he said; ""for when I was telling"
1446,THE AGE,"Of the heroic deed performed by the hand of that maiden,"
1447,THE AGE,"When she snatched the man's sword, and delivered herself and her charges,"
1448,THE AGE,"This was the one! she is vigorous born, as thou seest by her stature;"
1449,THE AGE,"Yet she is good as strong, for her aged kinsman she tended"
1450,THE AGE,"Until the day of his death, which was finally hastened by sorrow"
1451,THE AGE,"Over his city's distress, and his own endangered possessions."
1452,THE AGE,"Also, with quiet submission, she bore the death of her lover,"
1453,THE AGE,"Who a high-spirited youth, in the earliest flush of excitement,"
1454,THE AGE,"Kindled by lofty resolve to fight for a glorious freedom,"
1455,THE AGE,"Hurried to Paris, where early a terrible death he encountered."
1456,THE AGE,"For as at home, so there, his foes were deceit and oppression."""
1457,THE AGE,
1458,THE AGE,"Thus the magistrate spoke. The others saluted and thanked him,"
1459,THE AGE,And from his purse a gold-piece the pastor drew forth:--for the silver
1460,THE AGE,"He had some hours before already in charity given,"
1461,THE AGE,When he in mournful groups had seen the poor fugitives passing;--
1462,THE AGE,"And to the magistrate handed it, saying: ""Apportion the money"
1463,THE AGE,"'Mongst thy destitute people, and God vouchsafe it an increase."""
1464,THE AGE,"But the stranger declined it, and, answering, said: ""We have rescued"
1465,THE AGE,"Many a dollar among us, with clothing and other possessions,"
1466,THE AGE,"And shall return, as I hope, ere yet our stock is exhausted."""
1467,THE AGE,
1468,THE AGE,"Then the pastor replied, and pressed the money upon him:"
1469,THE AGE,"""None should be backward in giving in days like the present, and no one"
1470,THE AGE,Ought to refuse to accept those gifts which in kindness are offered.
1471,THE AGE,"None can tell how long he may hold what in peace he possesses,"
1472,THE AGE,"None how much longer yet he shall roam through the land of the stranger,"
1473,THE AGE,"And of his farm be deprived, and deprived of the garden that feeds him."""
1474,THE AGE,
1475,THE AGE,"""Ay, to be sure!"" in his bustling way interrupted the doctor:"
1476,THE AGE,"""If I had only some money about me, ye surely should have it,"
1477,THE AGE,Little and big; for certainly many among you must need it.
1478,THE AGE,"Yet I'll not go without giving thee something to show what my will is,"
1479,THE AGE,"Even though sadly behind my good-will must lag the performance."""
1480,THE AGE,"Thus, as he spoke, by its straps his embroidered pocket of leather,"
1481,THE AGE,"Where his tobacco was kept, he drew forth,--enough was now in it"
1482,THE AGE,"Several pipes to fill,--and daintily opened, and portioned."
1483,THE AGE,"""Small is the gift,"" he added. The justice, however, made answer:"
1484,THE AGE,"""Good tobacco can ne'er to the traveller fail to be welcome."""
1485,THE AGE,Then did the village doctor begin to praise his canister.
1486,THE AGE,
1487,THE AGE,"But the clergyman drew him away, and they quitted the justice."
1488,THE AGE,"""Let us make haste,"" said the thoughtful man: ""the youth's waiting in torture;"
1489,THE AGE,"Come I let him hear, as soon as he may, the jubilant tidings."""
1490,THE AGE,
1491,THE AGE,"So they hastened their steps, and came to where under the lindens"
1492,THE AGE,Hermann against the carriage was leaning. The horses were stamping
1493,THE AGE,"Wildly the turf; he held them in check, and, buried in musing,"
1494,THE AGE,"Stood, into vacancy gazing before him; nor saw the two envoys,"
1495,THE AGE,"Till, as they came, they called out and made to him signals of triumph."
1496,THE AGE,"E'en as far off as they then were, the doctor began to address him;"
1497,THE AGE,But they were presently nearer come and then the good pastor
1498,THE AGE,"Grasped his hand and exclaimed, interrupting the word of his comrade:"
1499,THE AGE,"""Hail to thee, O young man! thy true eye and heart have well chosen;"
1500,THE AGE,Joy be to thee and the wife of thy youth; for of thee she is worthy.
1501,THE AGE,"Come then and turn us the wagon, and drive straightway to the village,"
1502,THE AGE,"There the good maid to woo, and soon bring her home to thy dwelling."""
1503,THE AGE,
1504,THE AGE,"Still, however, the young man stood, without sign of rejoicing"
1505,THE AGE,"Hearing his messenger's words, though heavenly they were and consoling."
1506,THE AGE,"Deeply he sighed as he said: ""With hurrying wheels we came hither,"
1507,THE AGE,"And shall be forced, perchance, to go mortified homeward and slowly."
1508,THE AGE,"For disquiet has fallen upon me since here I've been waiting,"
1509,THE AGE,Doubt and suspicion and all that can torture the heart of a lover.
1510,THE AGE,"Think ye we have but to come, and that then the maiden will follow"
1511,THE AGE,"Merely because we are rich, while she is poor and an exile?"
1512,THE AGE,
1513,THE AGE,"""Poverty, too, makes proud, when it comes unmerited! Active"
1514,THE AGE,"Seems she to be, and contented, and so of the world is she mistress."
1515,THE AGE,"Think ye a maiden like her, with the manners and beauty that she has,"
1516,THE AGE,"Can into woman have grown, and no worthy man's love have attracted?"
1517,THE AGE,Think ye that love until now can have been shut out from her bosom?
1518,THE AGE,Drive not thither too rashly: we might to our mortification
1519,THE AGE,Have to turn softly homewards our horses' heads. For my fear is
1520,THE AGE,That to some youth already this heart has been given; already
1521,THE AGE,"This brave hand has been clasped, has pledged faith to some fortunate lover."
1522,THE AGE,"Then with my offer, alas! I should stand in confusion before her."""
1523,THE AGE,
1524,THE AGE,"Straightway the pastor had opened his lips to speak consolation,"
1525,THE AGE,"When his companion broke in, and said in his voluble fashion:"
1526,THE AGE,"""Years ago, forsooth, unknown had been such a dilemma."
1527,THE AGE,All such affairs were then conducted in regular fashion.
1528,THE AGE,"Soon as a bride for their son had been by the parents selected,"
1529,THE AGE,"First some family friend they into their councils would summon,"
1530,THE AGE,Whom they afterwards sent as a suitor to visit the parents
1531,THE AGE,"Of the elected bride. Arrayed in his finest apparel,"
1532,THE AGE,"Soon after dinner on Sunday he sought the respectable burgher,"
1533,THE AGE,"When some friendly words were exchanged upon general subjects,"
1534,THE AGE,He knowing how to direct the discourse as suited his purpose.
1535,THE AGE,"After much circumlocution he finally mentioned the daughter,"
1536,THE AGE,Praising her highly; and praising the man and the house that had sent him.
1537,THE AGE,"Persons of tact perceived his intent, and the politic envoy"
1538,THE AGE,"Readily saw how their minds were disposed, and explained himself further."
1539,THE AGE,"Then were the offer declined, e'en the 'no' brought not mortification;"
1540,THE AGE,"But did it meet with success, the suitor was ever thereafter"
1541,THE AGE,Made the chief guest in the house on every festive occasion.
1542,THE AGE,"For, through the rest of their lives, the couple ne'er failed to remember"
1543,THE AGE,That 'twas by his experienced hand the first knot had been gathered.
1544,THE AGE,"All that, however, is changed, and, with many another good custom,"
1545,THE AGE,Quite fallen out of the fashion; for every man woos for himself now.
1546,THE AGE,"Therefore let every man hear to his face pronounced the refusal,"
1547,THE AGE,"If a refusal there be, and stand shamed in the sight of the maiden!"""
1548,THE AGE,
1549,THE AGE,"""Let that be as it may!"" made answer the youth, who had scarcely"
1550,THE AGE,Unto the words paid heed; but in silence had made his decision.
1551,THE AGE,"""I will go thither myself, will myself hear my destiny spoken"
1552,THE AGE,Out of the lips of a maiden in whom I a confidence cherish
1553,THE AGE,Greater than heart of man has e'er before cherished in woman.
1554,THE AGE,"Say what she will, 'twill be good and wise; of that I am certain."
1555,THE AGE,"Should I behold her never again, yet this once will I see her;"
1556,THE AGE,"Yet this once the clear gaze of those dark eyes will encounter,"
1557,THE AGE,"If I must press her ne'er to my heart, yet that neck and that bosom"
1558,THE AGE,"Will I behold once more, that my arm so longs to encircle;"
1559,THE AGE,"Once more that mouth will see, whose kiss and whose 'yes' would for ever"
1560,THE AGE,"Render me happy, from which a 'no' will for ever destroy me."
1561,THE AGE,But ye must leave me alone. Do not wait for me here; but return ye
1562,THE AGE,"Back to my father and mother again, and give them the knowledge"
1563,THE AGE,"That their son has not been deceived, that the maiden is worthy."
1564,THE AGE,So then leave me alone! I shall follow the footpath that crosses
1565,THE AGE,"Over the hill by the pear-tree, and thence descends through our vineyard,"
1566,THE AGE,"Taking a shorter way home. And oh, may I bring to our dwelling,"
1567,THE AGE,Joyful and quick my beloved! but perhaps I alone may come creeping
1568,THE AGE,"Over that path to the house, and ne'er again tread it with gladness."""
1569,THE AGE,
1570,THE AGE,"Thus he spoke, and gave up the reins to the hand of the pastor,"
1571,THE AGE,"Who understandingly grasped them, the foaming horses controlling,"
1572,THE AGE,"Speedily mounted the carriage, and sat in the seat of the driver."
1573,THE AGE,
1574,THE AGE,"But thou didst hesitate, provident neighbor, and say in remonstrance:"
1575,THE AGE,"""Heart and soul and spirit, my friend, I willingly trust thee;"
1576,THE AGE,"But as for life and limb, they are not in the safest of keeping,"
1577,THE AGE,"When the temporal reins are usurped by the hand of the clergy."""
1578,THE AGE,
1579,THE AGE,"But thou didst laugh at his words, intelligent pastor, and answer:"
1580,THE AGE,"""Sit thee down, and contentedly trust me both body and spirit;"
1581,THE AGE,"For, in holding the reins, my hand grew long ago skilful,"
1582,THE AGE,Long has my eye been trained in making the nicest of turnings;
1583,THE AGE,"For we were practised well in driving the carriage in Strasburg,"
1584,THE AGE,When I the youthful baron accompanied thither; then daily
1585,THE AGE,"Rolled the carriage, guided by me, through the echoing gateway,"
1586,THE AGE,"Out over dusty roads till we reached the meadows and lindens,"
1587,THE AGE,"Steering through groups of the town's-folk beguiling the day there with walking."""
1588,THE AGE,
1589,THE AGE,"Thereupon, half-reassured, the neighbor ascended the wagon,"
1590,THE AGE,"Sat like one who for a prudent leap is holding him ready,"
1591,THE AGE,"And the stallions sped rapidly homeward, desiring their stable."
1592,THE AGE,Clouds of dust whirled up from under their powerful hoofbeats.
1593,THE AGE,"Long the youth stood there yet, and saw the dust in its rising,"
1594,THE AGE,Saw the dust as it settled again: he stood there unheeding.
1595,THE AGE,
1596,THE AGE,
1597,THE AGE,
1598,THE AGE,
1599,ERATO,ERATO
1600,ERATO,
1601,DOROTHEA,DOROTHEA
1602,DOROTHEA,
1603,DOROTHEA,"Like as the traveller, who, when the sun is approaching its setting,"
1604,DOROTHEA,"Fixes his eyes on it once again ere quickly it vanish,"
1605,DOROTHEA,"Then on the sides of the rocks, and on all the darkening bushes,"
1606,DOROTHEA,Sees its hovering image; whatever direction he look in
1607,DOROTHEA,"That hastes before, and flickers and gleams in radiant colors,--"
1608,DOROTHEA,So before Hermann's eyes moved the beautiful shape of the maiden
1609,DOROTHEA,"Softly, and seeming to follow the path that led into the cornfield."
1610,DOROTHEA,But he aroused from his wildering dream and turned himself slowly
1611,DOROTHEA,Towards where the village lay and was wildered again; for again came
1612,DOROTHEA,Moving to meet him the lofty form of the glorious maiden.
1613,DOROTHEA,Fixedly gazed he upon her; herself it was and no phantom.
1614,DOROTHEA,"Bearing in either hand a larger jar and a smaller,"
1615,DOROTHEA,"Each by the handle, with busy step she came on to the fountain."
1616,DOROTHEA,Joyfully then he hastened to meet her; the sight of her gave him
1617,DOROTHEA,Courage and strength; and thus the astonished girl he accosted:
1618,DOROTHEA,"""Do I then find thee, brave-hearted maiden, so soon again busy,"
1619,DOROTHEA,"Rendering aid unto others, and happy in bringing them comfort?"
1620,DOROTHEA,"Say why thou comest alone to this well which lies at such a distance,"
1621,DOROTHEA,When all the rest are content with the water they find in the village?
1622,DOROTHEA,"This has peculiar virtues, 'tis true; and the taste is delicious."
1623,DOROTHEA,"Thou to that mother wouldst bring it, I trow, whom thy faithfulness rescued."""
1624,DOROTHEA,
1625,DOROTHEA,Straightway with cordial greeting the kindly maiden made answer:
1626,DOROTHEA,"""Here has my walk to the spring already been amply rewarded,"
1627,DOROTHEA,Since I have found the good friend who bestowed so abundantly on us;
1628,DOROTHEA,For a pleasure not less than the gifts is the sight of the giver.
1629,DOROTHEA,"Come, I pray thee, and see for thyself who has tasted thy bounty;"
1630,DOROTHEA,"Come, and the quiet thanks receive of all it has solaced."
1631,DOROTHEA,But that thou straightway the reason mayst know for which I am hither
1632,DOROTHEA,"Come to draw, where pure and unfailing the water is flowing,"
1633,DOROTHEA,"This I must tell thee,--that all the water we have in the village"
1634,DOROTHEA,Has by improvident people been troubled with horses and oxen
1635,DOROTHEA,Wading direct through the source which brings the inhabitants water.
1636,DOROTHEA,And furthermore they have also made foul with their washings and rinsings
1637,DOROTHEA,"All the troughs of the village, and all the fountains have sullied;"
1638,DOROTHEA,"For but one thought is in all, and that how to satisfy quickest"
1639,DOROTHEA,"Self and the need of the moment, regardless of what may come after."""
1640,DOROTHEA,
1641,DOROTHEA,"Thus she spoke, and the broad stone steps meanwhile had descended"
1642,DOROTHEA,"With her companion beside her, and on the low wall of the fountain"
1643,DOROTHEA,"Both sat them down. She bent herself over to draw, and he also"
1644,DOROTHEA,"Took in his hand the jar that remained, and bent himself over,"
1645,DOROTHEA,"And in the blue of the heavens, they, seeing their image reflected,"
1646,DOROTHEA,Friendly greetings and nods exchanged in the quivering mirror.
1647,DOROTHEA,
1648,DOROTHEA,"""Give me to drink,"" the youth thereupon in his gladness petitioned,"
1649,DOROTHEA,"And she handed the pitcher. Familiarly sat they and rested,"
1650,DOROTHEA,"Both leaning over their jars, till she presently asked her companion:"
1651,DOROTHEA,"""Tell me, why I find thee here, and without thy horses and wagon,"
1652,DOROTHEA,"Far from the place where I met thee at first? how camest thou hither?"""
1653,DOROTHEA,
1654,DOROTHEA,"Thoughtful he bent his eyes on the ground, then quietly raised them"
1655,DOROTHEA,"Up to her face, and, meeting with frankness the gaze of the maiden,"
1656,DOROTHEA,"Felt himself solaced and stilled. But then impossible was it,"
1657,DOROTHEA,"That he of love should speak; her eye told not of affection,"
1658,DOROTHEA,"Only of clear understanding, requiring intelligent answer."
1659,DOROTHEA,"And he composed himself quickly, and cordially said to the maiden:"
1660,DOROTHEA,"""Hearken to me, my child, and let me reply to thy question."
1661,DOROTHEA,'Twas for thy sake that hither I came; why seek to conceal it?
1662,DOROTHEA,"Know I live happy at home with both my affectionate parents,"
1663,DOROTHEA,"Faithfully giving my aid their house and estates in directing,"
1664,DOROTHEA,"Being an only son, and because our affairs are extensive."
1665,DOROTHEA,Mine is the charge of the farm; my father bears rule in the household;
1666,DOROTHEA,While the presiding spirit of all is the diligent mother.
1667,DOROTHEA,"But thine experience doubtless has taught thee how grievously servants,"
1668,DOROTHEA,"Now through deceit, and now through their carelessness, harass the mistress,"
1669,DOROTHEA,Forcing her ever to change and replace one fault with another.
1670,DOROTHEA,"Long for that reason my mother has wished for a maid in the household,"
1671,DOROTHEA,"Who not with hand alone, but with heart, too, will lend her assistance,"
1672,DOROTHEA,"Taking the daughter's place, whom, alas! she was early deprived of."
1673,DOROTHEA,"How when to-day by the wagon I saw thee, so ready and cheerful,"
1674,DOROTHEA,"Witnessed the strength of thine arms, and thy limbs of such healthful proportion,"
1675,DOROTHEA,"When thy intelligent speech I heard, I was smitten with wonder."
1676,DOROTHEA,"Hastening homeward, I there to my parents and neighbors the stranger"
1677,DOROTHEA,Praised as she well deserved. But I now am come hither to tell thee
1678,DOROTHEA,"What is their wish as mine.--Forgive me my stammering language."""
1679,DOROTHEA,
1680,DOROTHEA,"""Hesitate not,"" she, answering, said, ""to tell me what follows."
1681,DOROTHEA,Thou dost not give me offence; I have listened with gratitude to thee:
1682,DOROTHEA,Speak it out honestly therefore; the sound of it will not alarm me.
1683,DOROTHEA,"Thou wouldst engage me as servant to wait on thy father and mother,"
1684,DOROTHEA,And to look after the well-ordered house of which ye are the owners;
1685,DOROTHEA,"And thou thinkest in me to find them a capable servant,"
1686,DOROTHEA,"One who is skilled in her work, and not of a rude disposition."
1687,DOROTHEA,"Short thy proposal has been, and short shall be also my answer."
1688,DOROTHEA,"Yes, I will go with thee home, and the call of fate I will follow."
1689,DOROTHEA,Here my duty is done: I have brought the newly made mother
1690,DOROTHEA,"Back to her kindred again, who are all in her safety rejoicing."
1691,DOROTHEA,Most of our people already are gathered; the others will follow.
1692,DOROTHEA,All think a few days more will certainly see them returning
1693,DOROTHEA,Unto their homes; for such is the exile's constant delusion.
1694,DOROTHEA,But by no easy hope do I suffer myself to be cheated
1695,DOROTHEA,During these sorrowful days which promise yet more days of sorrow.
1696,DOROTHEA,"All the bands of the world have been loosed, and what shall unite them,"
1697,DOROTHEA,"Saving alone the need, the need supreme, that is on us?"
1698,DOROTHEA,"If in a good man's house I can earn my living by service,"
1699,DOROTHEA,"Under the eye of an excellent mistress, I gladly will do it;"
1700,DOROTHEA,"Since of doubtful repute, must be always a wandering maiden."
1701,DOROTHEA,"Yes, I will go with thee, soon as I first shall have carried the pitchers"
1702,DOROTHEA,"Back to my friends, and prayed the good people to give me their blessing."
1703,DOROTHEA,"Come thou must see them thyself, and from their hands must receive me."""
1704,DOROTHEA,
1705,DOROTHEA,"Joyfully hearkened the youth to the willing maiden's decision,"
1706,DOROTHEA,Doubtful whether he ought not at once to make honest confession.
1707,DOROTHEA,"Yet it appeared to him best to leave her awhile in her error,"
1708,DOROTHEA,"Nor for her love to sue, before leading her home to his dwelling."
1709,DOROTHEA,"Ah! and the golden ring he perceived on the hand of the maiden,"
1710,DOROTHEA,"Wherefore he let her speak on, and gave diligent ear to her language."
1711,DOROTHEA,
1712,DOROTHEA,"""Come,"" she presently said, ""Let us back to the village; for maidens"
1713,DOROTHEA,Always are sure to be blamed if they tarry too long at the fountain.
1714,DOROTHEA,"Yet how delightful it is to chat by the murmuring water!"""
1715,DOROTHEA,
1716,DOROTHEA,"Then from their seats they rose, and both of them turned to the fountain"
1717,DOROTHEA,"One more look behind, and a tender longing possessed them."
1718,DOROTHEA,"Both of the water-jars then in silence she took by the handle,"
1719,DOROTHEA,"Carried them up the steps, while behind her followed her lover."
1720,DOROTHEA,One of the pitchers he begged her to give him to lighten the burden.
1721,DOROTHEA,"""Nay, let it be!"" she said: ""I carry them better so balanced."
1722,DOROTHEA,"Nor shall the master, who is to command, be doing me service."
1723,DOROTHEA,"Look not so gravely upon me, as thinking my fortune a hard one."
1724,DOROTHEA,"Early a woman should learn to serve, for that is her calling;"
1725,DOROTHEA,"Since through service alone she finally comes to the headship,"
1726,DOROTHEA,Comes to the due command that is hers of right in the household.
1727,DOROTHEA,"Early the sister must wait on her brother, and wait on her parents;"
1728,DOROTHEA,"Life must be always with her a perpetual coming and going,"
1729,DOROTHEA,"Or be a fetching and carrying, making and doing for others."
1730,DOROTHEA,"Happy for her be she wonted to think no way is too grievous,"
1731,DOROTHEA,And if the hours of the night be to her as the hours of the daytime;
1732,DOROTHEA,"If she find never a needle too fine, nor a labor too trifling;"
1733,DOROTHEA,"Wholly forgetful of self, and caring to live but in others!"
1734,DOROTHEA,"For she will surely, as mother, have need of every virtue,"
1735,DOROTHEA,"When, in the time of her illness, the cries of her infant arouse her"
1736,DOROTHEA,"Calling for food from her weakness, and cares are to suffering added."
1737,DOROTHEA,Twenty men bound into one were not able to bear such a burden;
1738,DOROTHEA,"Nor is it meant that they should, yet should they with gratitude view it."""
1739,DOROTHEA,
1740,DOROTHEA,"Thus she spoke, and was come, meanwhile, with her silent companion,"
1741,DOROTHEA,"Far as the floor of the barn, at the furthermost end of the garden,"
1742,DOROTHEA,"Where was the sick woman lying, whom, glad, she had left with her daughters,"
1743,DOROTHEA,Those late rescued maidens: fair pictures of innocence were they.
1744,DOROTHEA,"Both of them entered the barn; and, e'en as they did so, the justice,"
1745,DOROTHEA,"Leading a child in each hand, came in from the other direction."
1746,DOROTHEA,"These had been lost, hitherto, from the sight of their sorrowing mother;"
1747,DOROTHEA,But in the midst of the crowd the old man now had descried them.
1748,DOROTHEA,"Joyfully sprang they forward to meet their dear mother's embraces,"
1749,DOROTHEA,"And to salute with delight their brother, their unknown companion."
1750,DOROTHEA,"Next upon Dorothea they sprang with affectionate greeting,"
1751,DOROTHEA,"Asking for bread and fruit, but more than all else for some water."
1752,DOROTHEA,So then she handed the water about; and not only the children
1753,DOROTHEA,"Drank, but the sick woman too, and her daughters, and with them the justice."
1754,DOROTHEA,"All were refreshed, and highly commended the glorious water;"
1755,DOROTHEA,"Acid it was to the taste, and reviving, and wholesome to drink of."
1756,DOROTHEA,
1757,DOROTHEA,"Then with a serious face the maiden replied to them, saying:"
1758,DOROTHEA,"""Friends, for the last time now to your mouth have I lifted my pitcher;"
1759,DOROTHEA,And for the last time by me have your lips been moistened with water.
1760,DOROTHEA,"But henceforth in the heat of the day when the draught shall refresh you,"
1761,DOROTHEA,"When in the shade ye enjoy your rest beside a clear fountain,"
1762,DOROTHEA,"Think of me then sometimes and of all my affectionate service,"
1763,DOROTHEA,Prompted more by my love than the duty I owed you as kindred.
1764,DOROTHEA,I shall acknowledge as long as I live the kindness ye've shown me.
1765,DOROTHEA,"'Tis with regret that I leave you; but every one now is a burden,"
1766,DOROTHEA,"More than a help to his neighbor, and all must be finally scattered"
1767,DOROTHEA,"Far through a foreign land, if return to our homes be denied us."
1768,DOROTHEA,"See, here stands the youth to whom we owe thanks for the presents."
1769,DOROTHEA,"He gave the cloak for the baby, and all these welcome provisions."
1770,DOROTHEA,"Now he is come, and has asked me if I will make one in his dwelling,"
1771,DOROTHEA,That I may serve therein his wealthy and excellent parents.
1772,DOROTHEA,And I refuse not the offer; for maidens must always be serving;
1773,DOROTHEA,Burdensome were it for them to rest and be served in the household.
1774,DOROTHEA,"Therefore I follow him gladly. A youth of intelligence seems he,"
1775,DOROTHEA,"And so will also the parents be, as becometh the wealthy."
1776,DOROTHEA,"So then farewell, dear friend; and mayst thou rejoice in thy nursling,"
1777,DOROTHEA,"Living, and into thy face already so healthfully looking!"
1778,DOROTHEA,"When thou shalt press him against thy breast in these gay-colored wrappings,"
1779,DOROTHEA,"Oh, then remember the kindly youth who bestowed them upon us,"
1780,DOROTHEA,"And who me also henceforth, thy sister, will shelter and nourish."
1781,DOROTHEA,"Thou, too, excellent man!"" she said as she turned to the justice;"
1782,DOROTHEA,"""Take my thanks that in many a need I have found thee a father."""
1783,DOROTHEA,"Then she knelt down on the floor by the side of the newly made mother,"
1784,DOROTHEA,"Kissing the weeping woman, and taking her low-whispered blessing."
1785,DOROTHEA,"Thou, meanwhile, worshipful justice, wast speaking to Hermann and saying:"
1786,DOROTHEA,"""Justly mayst thou, my friend, be counted among the good masters,"
1787,DOROTHEA,Careful to manage their household affairs with capable servants.
1788,DOROTHEA,"For I have often observed how in sheep, as in horses and oxen,"
1789,DOROTHEA,"Men conclude never a bargain without making closest inspection,"
1790,DOROTHEA,"While with a servant who all things preserves, if honest and able,"
1791,DOROTHEA,"And who will every thing lose and destroy, if he set to work falsely,"
1792,DOROTHEA,"Him will a chance or an accident make us admit to our dwelling,"
1793,DOROTHEA,"And we are left, when too late, to repent an o'er hasty decision."
1794,DOROTHEA,"Thou understandest the matter it seems; because thou hast chosen,"
1795,DOROTHEA,"Thee and thy parents to serve in the house, a maid who is honest."
1796,DOROTHEA,"Hold her with care; for as long as thy household is under her keeping,"
1797,DOROTHEA,"Thou shalt not want for a sister, nor yet for a daughter thy parents."""
1798,DOROTHEA,
1799,DOROTHEA,"Many were come, meanwhile, near relatives all of the mother,"
1800,DOROTHEA,"Bringing her various gifts, and more suitable quarters announcing."
1801,DOROTHEA,"All of them, hearing the maiden's decision, gave Hermann their blessing,"
1802,DOROTHEA,"Coupled with glances of meaning, while each made his special reflections."
1803,DOROTHEA,Hastily one and another would say in the ear of his neighbor:
1804,DOROTHEA,"""If in the master a lover she find, right well were she cared for."""
1805,DOROTHEA,"Hermann took her at last by the hand, and said as he did so:"
1806,DOROTHEA,"""Let us be going; the day is declining, and distant the city."""
1807,DOROTHEA,Eager and voluble then the women embraced Dorothea;
1808,DOROTHEA,Hermann drew her away; but other adieus must be spoken:
1809,DOROTHEA,"Lastly the children with cries fell upon her and terrible weeping,"
1810,DOROTHEA,"Clung to her garments, and would not their dear second mother should leave them."
1811,DOROTHEA,"But in a tone of command the women said, one and another:"
1812,DOROTHEA,"""Hush now, children, she's going to the town, and will presently bring you"
1813,DOROTHEA,Plenty of nice sweet cake that was by your brother bespoken
1814,DOROTHEA,When by the stork just now he was brought past the shop of the baker.
1815,DOROTHEA,"Soon you will see her come back with sugar-plums splendidly gilded."""
1816,DOROTHEA,"Then did the little ones loose their hold, and Hermann, though hardly,"
1817,DOROTHEA,"Tore her from further embraces away, and far-waving kerchiefs."
1818,DOROTHEA,
1819,DOROTHEA,
1820,DOROTHEA,
1821,DOROTHEA,
1822,MELPOMENE,MELPOMENE
1823,MELPOMENE,
1824,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA
1825,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,
1826,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,Towards the setting sun the two thus went on their journey:
1827,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,Close he had wrapped himself round with clouds portending a tempest.
1828,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Out from the veil, now here and now there, with fiery flashes,"
1829,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,Gleaming over the field shot forth the ominous lightning.
1830,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"""May not these threatening heavens,"" said Hermann, ""be presently sending"
1831,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Hailstones upon us and violent rains; for fair is the harvest."""
1832,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,And in the waving luxuriant grain they delighted together:
1833,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,Almost as high it reached as the lofty shapes that moved through it.
1834,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,
1835,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Thereupon spoke the maiden, and said to her guide and companion:"
1836,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"""Friend, unto whom I soon am to owe so kindly a fortune,"
1837,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Shelter and home, while many an exile's exposed to the tempest,"
1838,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Tell me concerning thy parents, I pray thee, and teach me to know them,"
1839,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,Them whom with all my heart I desire to serve in the future.
1840,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Who understands his master, more easily gives satisfaction,"
1841,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Having regard to the things which to him seem chief in importance,"
1842,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,And on the doing of which his firm-set mind is determined.
1843,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Tell me therefore, I pray, how to win thy father and mother."""
1844,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,
1845,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,And to her question made answer the good and intelligent Hermann:
1846,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"""Ah, what wisdom thou showest, thou good, thou excellent maiden,"
1847,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,Asking thus first of all concerning the tastes of my parents!
1848,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Know that in vain hitherto I have labored in serving my father,"
1849,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Taking upon me as were it my own, the charge of the household;"
1850,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Early and late at work in the fields, and o'erseeing the vineyard."
1851,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"But my mother I fully content, who can value my service;"
1852,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"And thou wilt also appear in her eyes the worthiest of maidens,"
1853,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"If for the house thou carest, as were it thine own thou wast keeping."
1854,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Otherwise is it with father, who cares for the outward appearance."
1855,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Do not regard me, good maiden, as one who is cold and unfeeling,"
1856,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,That unto thee a stranger I straightway discover my father.
1857,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Nay, I assure thee that never before have words such as these are"
1858,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Freely dropped from my tongue, which is not accustomed to prattle;"
1859,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,But from out of my bosom thou lurest its every secret.
1860,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Some of the graces of life my good father covets about him,"
1861,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Outward signs of affection he wishes, as well as of honor;"
1862,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"And an inferior servant might possibly give satisfaction,"
1863,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Who could turn these to account, while he might be displeased with a better."""
1864,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,
1865,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Thereupon said she with joy, the while her hastening footsteps"
1866,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,Over the darkening pathway with easy motion she quickened:
1867,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"""Truly I hope to them both I shall equally give satisfaction:"
1868,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"For in thy mother's nature I find such an one as mine own is,"
1869,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,And to the outward graces I've been from my childhood accustomed.
1870,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Greatly was courtesy valued among our neighbors the Frenchmen,"
1871,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"During their earlier days; it was common to noble and burgher,"
1872,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"As to the peasant, and every one made it the rule of his household."
1873,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"So, on the side of us Germans, the children were likewise accustomed"
1874,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Daily to bring to their parents, with kissing of hands and with curtseys,"
1875,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Morning good-wishes, and all through the day to be prettily mannered."
1876,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Every thing thus that I learned, and to which I've been used from my childhood,"
1877,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"All that my heart shall suggest, shall be brought into play for thy father."
1878,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"But who shall tell me of thee, and how thyself shouldst be treated,"
1879,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Thou the only son of the house, and henceforth my master?"""
1880,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,
1881,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Thus she said, and e'en as she spoke they stood under the pear-tree."
1882,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,Down from the heavens the moon at her full was shedding her splendor.
1883,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Night had come on, and wholly obscured was the last gleam of sunlight,"
1884,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"So that contrasting masses lay side by side with each other,"
1885,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Clear and bright as the day, and black with the shadows of midnight;"
1886,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,Gratefully fell upon Hermann's ear the kindly asked question
1887,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Under the shade of the glorious tree, the spot he so treasured,"
1888,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,Which but this morning had witnessed the tears he had shed for the exile.
1889,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"And while they sat themselves down to rest them here for a little,"
1890,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Thus spoke the amorous youth, as he grasped the hand of the maiden:"
1891,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"""Suffer thy heart to make answer, and follow it freely in all things."""
1892,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,Yet naught further he ventured to say although so propitious
1893,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,Seemed the hour: he feared he should only haste on a refusal.
1894,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Ah, and he felt besides the ring on her finger, sad token!"
1895,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Therefore they sat there, silent and still, beside one another."
1896,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,
1897,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"First was the maiden to speak: ""How sweet is this glorious moonlight!"""
1898,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Said she at length: ""It is as the light of the day in its brightness."
1899,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"There in the city I plainly can see the houses and courtyards,"
1900,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"And in the gable--methinks I can number its panes-is a window."""
1901,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,
1902,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"""What thou seest,"" the modest youth thereupon made her answer,--"
1903,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"""What thou seest is our dwelling, to which I am leading thee downward,"
1904,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"And that window yonder belongs to my room in the attic,"
1905,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Which will be thine perhaps, for various changes are making."
1906,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"All these fields, too, are ours; they are ripe for the harvest to-morrow."
1907,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Here in the shade we will rest, and partake of our noontide refreshment."
1908,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,But it is time we began our descent through the vineyard and garden;
1909,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"For dost thou mark how yon threatening storm-cloud comes nearer and nearer,"
1910,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Charged with lightning, and ready our fair full moon to extinguish?"""
1911,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,
1912,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"So they arose from their seats, and over the cornfields descended,"
1913,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Through the luxuriant grain, enjoying the brightness of evening,"
1914,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Until they came to the vineyard, and so entered into its shadow."
1915,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Then he guided her down o'er the numerous blocks that were lying,"
1916,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Rough and unhewn on the pathway, and served as the steps of the alley."
1917,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Slowly the maiden descended, and leaning her hands on his shoulder,"
1918,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"While with uncertain beams, the moon through the leaves overlooked them,"
1919,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Ere she was veiled by the cloud, and so left the couple in darkness."
1920,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,Carefully Hermann's strength supported the maid that hung o'er him;
1921,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"But, not knowing the path and the rough-hewn steps that led down it,"
1922,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Missed she her footing, her ankle turned, and she surely had fallen,"
1923,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Had not the dexterous youth his arm outstretched in an instant,"
1924,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,And his beloved upheld. She gently sank on his shoulder;
1925,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Breast was pressed against breast, and cheek against cheek. Thus he stood there"
1926,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Fixed as a marble statue, the force of will keeping him steadfast,"
1927,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Drew her not to him more closely, but braced himself under her pressure."
1928,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Thus he the glorious burden felt, the warmth of her bosom,"
1929,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"And the perfume of her breath, that over his lips was exhaling;"
1930,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,Bore with the heart of a man the majestic form of the woman.
1931,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,
1932,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"But she with playfulness said, concealing the pain that she suffered:"
1933,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"""That is a sign of misfortune, so timorous persons would tell us,"
1934,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,When on approaching a house we stumble not far from the threshold;
1935,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"And for myself, I confess, I could wish for a happier omen."
1936,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Let us here linger awhile that thy parents may not have to blame thee,"
1937,HERMANN AND DOROTHEA,"Seeing a limping maid, and thou seem an incompetent landlord."""

1955,PROSPECT,"Spoke of the gathering storm, and the moonlight's rapid obscuring;"
1956,PROSPECT,Then of her son's late tarrying abroad and the dangers of nightfall;
1957,PROSPECT,"Sharply upbraided her friends that without having speech of the maiden,"
1958,PROSPECT,"And without urging his suit, they had parted from Hermann so early."
1959,PROSPECT,
1960,PROSPECT,"""Make it not worse than it is,"" the father replied with displeasure."
1961,PROSPECT,"""For, as thou seest, we tarry ourselves and are waiting the issue."""
1962,PROSPECT,
1963,PROSPECT,"Calmly, however, from where he was sitting the neighbor made answer:"
1964,PROSPECT,"""Never in hours of disquiet like this do I fail to be grateful"
1965,PROSPECT,"Unto my late, blessed father, who every root of impatience"
1966,PROSPECT,"Tore from my heart when a child, and left no fibre remaining;"
1967,PROSPECT,"So that I learned on the instant to wait as do none of your sages."""
1968,PROSPECT,
1969,PROSPECT,"""Tell us,"" the pastor returned, ""what legerdemain he made use of."""
1970,PROSPECT,"""That will I gladly relate, for all may draw from it a lesson;"""
1971,PROSPECT,"So made the neighbor reply. ""When a boy I once stood of a Sunday"
1972,PROSPECT,"Full of impatience, and looking with eagerness out for the carriage"
1973,PROSPECT,Which was to carry us forth to the spring that lies under the lindens.
1974,PROSPECT,"Still the coach came not. I ran, like a weasel, now hither, now thither,"
1975,PROSPECT,"Up stairs and down, and forward and back, 'twixt the door and the window;"
1976,PROSPECT,"Even my fingers itched to be moving; I scratched on the tables,"
1977,PROSPECT,"Went about pounding and stamping, and hardly could keep me from weeping."
1978,PROSPECT,All was observed by the calm-tempered man; but at last when my folly
1979,PROSPECT,"Came to be carried too far, by the arm he quietly took me,"
1980,PROSPECT,"Led me away to the window, and spoke in this serious language:"
1981,PROSPECT,'Seest thou yonder the carpenter's shop that is closed for the Sunday?
1982,PROSPECT,"He will re-open to-morrow, when plane and saw will be started,"
1983,PROSPECT,And will keep on through the hours of labor from morning till evening.
1984,PROSPECT,"But consider you this,--a day will be presently coming"
1985,PROSPECT,"When that man shall himself be astir and all of his workmen,"
1986,PROSPECT,Making a coffin for thee to be quickly and skilfully finished.
1987,PROSPECT,"Then that house of boards they will busily bring over hither,"
1988,PROSPECT,"Which must at last receive alike the impatient and patient,"
1989,PROSPECT,And which is destined soon with close-pressing roof to be covered.'
1990,PROSPECT,Straightway I saw the whole thing in my mind as if it were doing;
1991,PROSPECT,"Saw the boards fitting together, and saw the black color preparing,"
1992,PROSPECT,"Sat me down patiently then, and in quiet awaited the carriage."
1993,PROSPECT,"Now when others I see, in seasons of anxious expectance,"
1994,PROSPECT,"Running distracted about, I cannot but think of the coffin."""
1995,PROSPECT,
1996,PROSPECT,"Smiling, the pastor replied: ""The affecting picture of death stands"
1997,PROSPECT,"Not as a dread to the wise, and not as an end to the pious."
1998,PROSPECT,"Those it presses again into life, and teaches to use it;"
1999,PROSPECT,These by affliction it strengthens in hope to future salvation.
2000,PROSPECT,Death becomes life unto both. Thy father was greatly mistaken
2001,PROSPECT,When to a sensitive boy he death in death thus depicted.
2002,PROSPECT,"Let us the value of nobly ripe age, point out to the young man,"
2003,PROSPECT,"And to the aged the youth, that in the eternal progression"
2004,PROSPECT,"Both may rejoice, and life may in life thus find its completion."""
2005,PROSPECT,
2006,PROSPECT,"But the door was now opened, and showed the majestical couple."
2007,PROSPECT,"Filled with amaze were the friends, and amazed the affectionate parents,"
2008,PROSPECT,Seeing the form of the maid so well matched with that of her lover.
2009,PROSPECT,"Yea, the door seemed too low to allow the tall figures to enter,"
2010,PROSPECT,As they together now appeared coming over the threshold.
2011,PROSPECT,
2012,PROSPECT,"Hermann, with hurried words, presented her thus to his parents:"
2013,PROSPECT,"""Here is a maiden,"" he said; ""such a one as ye wish in the household."
2014,PROSPECT,"Kindly receive her, dear father: she merits it well; and thou, mother,"
2015,PROSPECT,"Question her straightway on all that belongs to a housekeeper's duty,"
2016,PROSPECT,"That ye may see how well she deserves to ye both to be nearer."""
2017,PROSPECT,
2018,PROSPECT,"Quickly he then drew aside the excellent clergyman, saying:"
2019,PROSPECT,"""Help me, O worthy sir, and speedily out of this trouble;"
2020,PROSPECT,"Loosen, I pray thee, this knot, at whose untying I tremble."
2021,PROSPECT,Know that 'tis not as a lover that I have brought hither the maiden;
2022,PROSPECT,"But she believes that as servant she comes to the house, and I tremble"
2023,PROSPECT,Lest in displeasure she fly as soon as there's mention of marriage.
2024,PROSPECT,But be it straightway decided; for she no longer in error
2025,PROSPECT,"Thus shall be left, and I this suspense no longer can suffer."
2026,PROSPECT,"Hasten and show us in this a proof of the wisdom we honor."""
2027,PROSPECT,
2028,PROSPECT,Towards the company then the clergyman instantly turned him;
2029,PROSPECT,"But already, alas! had the soul of the maiden been troubled,"
2030,PROSPECT,"Hearing the father's speech; for he, in his sociable fashion,"
2031,PROSPECT,"Had in these playful words, with the kindest intention addressed her:"
2032,PROSPECT,"""Ay, this is well, my child! with delight I perceive that my Hermann"
2033,PROSPECT,"Has the good taste of his father, who often showed his in his young days,"
2034,PROSPECT,"Leading out always the fairest to dance, and bringing the fairest"
2035,PROSPECT,Finally home as his wife; our dear little mother here that was.
2036,PROSPECT,"For by the bride that a man shall elect we can judge what himself is,"
2037,PROSPECT,"Tell what the spirit is in him, and whether he feel his own value."
2038,PROSPECT,"Nor didst thou need for thyself, I'll engage, much time for decision;"
2039,PROSPECT,"For, in good sooth, methinks, he's no difficult person to follow."""
2040,PROSPECT,
2041,PROSPECT,"Hermann had heard but in part; his limbs were inwardly trembling,"
2042,PROSPECT,And of a sudden a stillness had fallen on all of the circle.
2043,PROSPECT,
2044,PROSPECT,"But by these words of derision, for such she could not but deem them,"
2045,PROSPECT,"Wounded, and stung to the depths of her soul, the excellent maiden,"
2046,PROSPECT,"Stood, while the fugitive blood o'er her cheeks and e'en to her bosom,"
2047,PROSPECT,"Poured its flush. But she governed herself, and her courage collecting,"
2048,PROSPECT,"Answered the old man thus, her pain not wholly concealing:"
2049,PROSPECT,"""Truly for such a reception thy son had in no wise prepared me,"
2050,PROSPECT,"When he the ways of his father described, the excellent burgher."
2051,PROSPECT,"Thou art a man of culture, I know, before whom I am standing;"
2052,PROSPECT,"Dealest with every one wisely, according as suits his position;"
2053,PROSPECT,"But thou hast scanty compassion, it seems, on one such as I am,"
2054,PROSPECT,"Who, a poor girl, am now crossing thy threshold with purpose to serve thee;"
2055,PROSPECT,"Else, with such bitter derision, thou wouldst not have made me remember"
2056,PROSPECT,How far removed my fortune from that of thyself and thy son is.
2057,PROSPECT,"True, I come poor to thy house, and bring with me naught but my bundle"
2058,PROSPECT,Here where is every abundance to gladden the prosperous inmates.
2059,PROSPECT,"Yet I know well myself; I feel the relations between us,"
2060,PROSPECT,"Say, is it noble, with so much of mockery straightway to greet me,"
2061,PROSPECT,"That I am sent from the house while my foot is scarce yet on the threshold?"""
2062,PROSPECT,
2063,PROSPECT,Anxiously Hermann turned and signed to his ally the pastor
2064,PROSPECT,That he should rush to the rescue and straightway dispel the delusion.
2065,PROSPECT,Then stepped the wise man hastily forward and looked on the maiden's
2066,PROSPECT,"Tearful eyes, her silent pain and repressed indignation,"
2067,PROSPECT,"And in his heart was impelled not at once to clear up the confusion,"
2068,PROSPECT,Rather to put to the test the girl's disquieted spirit.
2069,PROSPECT,Therefore he unto her said in language intended to try her:
2070,PROSPECT,"""Surely, thou foreign-born maiden, thou didst not maturely consider,"
2071,PROSPECT,"When thou too rashly decidedst to enter the service of strangers,"
2072,PROSPECT,All that is meant by the placing thyself 'neath the rule of a master;
2073,PROSPECT,"For by our hand to a bargain the fate of the year is determined,"
2074,PROSPECT,And but a single 'yea' compels to much patient endurance.
2075,PROSPECT,"Not the worst part of the service the wearisome steps to be taken,"
2076,PROSPECT,Neither the bitter sweat of a labor that presses unceasing;
2077,PROSPECT,Since the industrious freeman must toil as well as the servant.
2078,PROSPECT,"But 'tis to bear with the master's caprice when he censures unjustly,"
2079,PROSPECT,"Or when, at variance with self, he orders now this, now the other;"
2080,PROSPECT,"Bear with the petulance, too, of the mistress, easily angered,"
2081,PROSPECT,"And with the rude, overbearing ways of unmannerly children."
2082,PROSPECT,"All this is hard to endure, and yet to go on with thy duties"
2083,PROSPECT,"Quickly, without delay, nor thyself grow sullen and stubborn."
2084,PROSPECT,"Yet thou appearest ill fitted for this, since already so deeply"
2085,PROSPECT,Stung by the father's jests: whereas there is nothing more common
2086,PROSPECT,"Than for a girl to be teased on account of a youth she may fancy."""
2087,PROSPECT,
2088,PROSPECT,"Thus he spoke. The maiden had felt the full force of his language,"
2089,PROSPECT,And she restrained her no more; but with passionate outburst her feelings
2090,PROSPECT,"Made themselves way; a sob broke forth from her now heaving bosom,"
2091,PROSPECT,"And, while the scalding tears poured down, she straightway made answer:"
2092,PROSPECT,"""Ah, that rational man who thinks to advise us in sorrow,"
2093,PROSPECT,Knows not how little of power his cold words have in relieving
2094,PROSPECT,Ever a heart from that woe which a sovereign fate has inflicted.
2095,PROSPECT,Ye are prosperous and glad; how then should a pleasantry wound you?
2096,PROSPECT,Yet but the lightest touch is a source of pain to the sick man.
2097,PROSPECT,"Nay, concealment itself, if successful, had profited nothing."
2098,PROSPECT,"Better show now what had later increased to a bitterer anguish,"
2099,PROSPECT,And to an inward consuming despair might perhaps have reduced me.
2100,PROSPECT,Let me go back! for here in this house I can tarry no longer.
2101,PROSPECT,"I will away, and wander in search of my hapless companions,"
2102,PROSPECT,Whom I forsook in their need; for myself alone choosing the better.
2103,PROSPECT,"This is my firm resolve, and I therefore may make a confession"
2104,PROSPECT,Which might for years perhaps have else lain hid in my bosom.
2105,PROSPECT,Deeply indeed was I hurt by the father's words of derision;
2106,PROSPECT,"Not that I'm sensitive, proud beyond what is fitting a servant;"
2107,PROSPECT,But that my heart in truth had felt itself stirred with affection
2108,PROSPECT,Towards the youth who to-day had appeared to my eyes as a savior.
2109,PROSPECT,"When he first left me there on the road, he still remained present,"
2110,PROSPECT,Haunting my every thought; I fancied the fortunate maiden
2111,PROSPECT,"Whom as a bride, perhaps, his heart had already elected."
2112,PROSPECT,"When at the fountain I met him again, the sight of him wakened"
2113,PROSPECT,Pleasure as great as if there had met me an angel from heaven;
2114,PROSPECT,"And with what gladness I followed, when asked to come as his servant."
2115,PROSPECT,"True, that I flattered myself in my heart,--I will not deny it,--"
2116,PROSPECT,"While we were hitherward coming, I might peradventure deserve him,"
2117,PROSPECT,Should I become at last the important stay of the household.
2118,PROSPECT,"Now I, alas! for the first time see what risk I was running,"
2119,PROSPECT,When I would make my home so near to the secretly loved one;
2120,PROSPECT,Now for the first time feel how far removed a poor maiden
2121,PROSPECT,"Is from an opulent youth, no matter how great her deserving."
2122,PROSPECT,"All this I now confess, that my heart ye may not misinterpret,"
2123,PROSPECT,In that 'twas hurt by a chance to which I owe my awaking.
2124,PROSPECT,"Hiding my secret desires, this dread had been ever before me,"
2125,PROSPECT,That at some early day he would bring him a bride to his dwelling;
2126,PROSPECT,"And ah, how could I then my inward anguish have suffered!"
2127,PROSPECT,"Happily I have been warned, and happily now has my bosom"
2128,PROSPECT,"Been of its secret relieved, while yet there is cure for the evil."
2129,PROSPECT,But no more; I have spoken; and now shall nothing detain me
2130,PROSPECT,"Longer here in a house where I stay but in shame and confusion,"
2131,PROSPECT,Freely confessing my love and that foolish hope that I cherished.
2132,PROSPECT,Not the night which abroad is covered with lowering storm clouds;
2133,PROSPECT,Not the roll of the thunder--I hear its peal--shall deter me;
2134,PROSPECT,Not the pelt of the rain which without is beating in fury;
2135,PROSPECT,Neither the blustering tempest; for all these things have I suffered
2136,PROSPECT,"During our sorrowful flight, and while the near foe was pursuing."
2137,PROSPECT,"Now I again go forth, as I have so long been accustomed,"
2138,PROSPECT,"Carried away by the whirl of the times, and from every thing parted."
2139,PROSPECT,"Fare ye well! I tarry no longer; all now is over."""
2140,PROSPECT,
2141,PROSPECT,"Thus she spoke and back to the door she hastily turned her,"
2142,PROSPECT,"Still bearing under her arm, as she with her had brought it, her bundle."
2143,PROSPECT,"But with both of her arms the mother seized hold of the maiden,"
2144,PROSPECT,"Clasping her round the waist, and exclaiming, amazed and bewildered:"
2145,PROSPECT,"""Tell me, what means all this? and these idle tears, say, what mean they?"
2146,PROSPECT,"I will not let thee depart: thou art the betrothed of my Hermann."""
2147,PROSPECT,
2148,PROSPECT,"But still the father stood, observing the scene with displeasure,"
2149,PROSPECT,"Looked on the weeping girl, and said in a tone of vexation:"
2150,PROSPECT,"""This then must be the return that I get for all my indulgence,"
2151,PROSPECT,That at the close of the day this most irksome of all things should happen!
2152,PROSPECT,"For there is naught I can tolerate less than womanish weeping,"
2153,PROSPECT,"Violent outcries, which only involve in disorder and passion,"
2154,PROSPECT,What with a little of sense had been more smoothly adjusted.
2155,PROSPECT,Settle the thing for yourselves: I'm going to bed; I've no patience
2156,PROSPECT,"Longer to be a spectator of these your marvellous doings."""
2157,PROSPECT,"Quickly he turned as he spoke, and hastened to go to the chamber"
2158,PROSPECT,"Where he was wonted to rest, and his marriage bed was kept standing,"
2159,PROSPECT,"But he was held by his son, who said in a tone of entreaty:"
2160,PROSPECT,"""Father, hasten not from us, and be thou not wroth with the maiden."
2161,PROSPECT,"I, only I, am to blame as the cause of all this confusion,"
2162,PROSPECT,Which by his dissimulation our friend unexpectedly heightened.
2163,PROSPECT,"Speak, O worthy sir; for to thee my cause I intrusted."
2164,PROSPECT,"Heap not up sorrow and anger, but rather let all this be ended;"
2165,PROSPECT,"For I could hold thee never again in such high estimation,"
2166,PROSPECT,"If thou shouldst show but delight in pain, not superior wisdom."""
2167,PROSPECT,
2168,PROSPECT,"Thereupon answered and said the excellent clergyman, smiling:"
2169,PROSPECT,"""Tell me, what other device could have drawn this charming confession"
2170,PROSPECT,"Out of the good maiden's lips, and thus have revealed her affection?"
2171,PROSPECT,Has not thy trouble been straightway transformed into gladness and rapture?
2172,PROSPECT,"Therefore speak up for thyself; what need of the tongue of another?"""
2173,PROSPECT,
2174,PROSPECT,"Thereupon Hermann came forward, and spoke in these words of affection:"
2175,PROSPECT,"""Do not repent of thy tears, nor repent of these passing distresses;"
2176,PROSPECT,"For they complete my joy, and--may I not hope it-thine also?"
2177,PROSPECT,"Not to engage the stranger, the excellent maid, as a servant,"
2178,PROSPECT,Unto the fountain I came; but to sue for thy love I came thither.
2179,PROSPECT,"Only, alas! my timorous look could thy heart's inclination"
2180,PROSPECT,"Nowise perceive; I read in thine eyes of nothing but kindness,"
2181,PROSPECT,As from the fountain's tranquil mirror thou gavest me greeting.
2182,PROSPECT,"Might I but bring thee home, the half of my joy was accomplished."
2183,PROSPECT,"But thou completest it unto me now; oh, blest be thou for it!"""
2184,PROSPECT,Then with a deep emotion the maiden gazed on the stripling;
2185,PROSPECT,"Neither forbade she embrace and kiss, the summit of rapture,"
2186,PROSPECT,"When to a loving pair they come as the longed-for assurance,"
2187,PROSPECT,"Pledge of a lifetime of bliss, that appears to them now never-ending."
2188,PROSPECT,
2189,PROSPECT,"Unto the others, meanwhile, the pastor had made explanation."
2190,PROSPECT,"But with feeling and grace the maid now advanced to the father,"
2191,PROSPECT,"Bent her before him, and kissing the hand he would fain have withholden,"
2192,PROSPECT,"Said: ""Thou wilt surely be just and forgive one so startled as I was,"
2193,PROSPECT,"First for my tears of distress, and now for the tears of my gladness."
2194,PROSPECT,"That emotion forgive me, and oh! forgive me this also."
2195,PROSPECT,For I can scarce comprehend the happiness newly vouchsafed me.
2196,PROSPECT,"Yes, let that first vexation of which I, bewildered, was guilty"
2197,PROSPECT,Be too the last. Whatever the maid of affectionate service
2198,PROSPECT,"Faithfully promised, shall be to thee now performed by the daughter."""
2199,PROSPECT,"Straightway then, concealing his tears, the father embraced her,"
2200,PROSPECT,"Cordially, too, the mother came forward and kissed her with fervor,"
2201,PROSPECT,Pressing her hands in her own: the weeping women were silent.
2202,PROSPECT,
2203,PROSPECT,"Thereupon quickly he seized, the good and intelligent pastor,"
2204,PROSPECT,"First the father's hand, and the wedding-ring drew from his finger,--"
2205,PROSPECT,"Not so easily either: the finger was plump and detained it,--"
2206,PROSPECT,"Next took the mother's ring also, and with them betrothed he the children,"
2207,PROSPECT,"Saying: ""These golden circlets once more their office performing"
2208,PROSPECT,"Firmly a tie shall unite, which in all things shall equal the old one,"
2209,PROSPECT,"Deeply is this young man imbued with love of the maiden,"
2210,PROSPECT,"And, as the maiden confesses, her heart is gone out to him also."
2211,PROSPECT,"Here do I therefore betroth you and bless for the years that are coming,"
2212,PROSPECT,"With the consent of the parents, and having this friend as a witness."""
2213,PROSPECT,
2214,PROSPECT,"Then the neighbor saluted at once, and expressed his good wishes;"
2215,PROSPECT,But when the clergyman now the golden circlet was drawing
2216,PROSPECT,"Over the maiden's hand, he observed with amazement the other,"
2217,PROSPECT,Which had already by Hermann been anxiously marked at the fountain.
2218,PROSPECT,And with a kindly raillery thus thereupon he addressed her:
2219,PROSPECT,"""So, then thy second betrothal is this? let us hope the first bridegroom"
2220,PROSPECT,"May not appear at the altar, and so prohibit the marriage."""
2221,PROSPECT,
2222,PROSPECT,"But she, answering, said: ""Oh, let me to this recollection"
2223,PROSPECT,"Yet one moment devote; for so much is due the good giver,"
2224,PROSPECT,"Him who bestowed it at parting, and never came back to his kindred."
2225,PROSPECT,"All that should come he foresaw, when in haste the passion for freedom,"
2226,PROSPECT,"When a desire in the newly changed order of things to be working,"
2227,PROSPECT,"Urged him onward to Paris, where chains and death he encountered."
2228,PROSPECT,"'Fare thee well,' were his words; 'I go, for all is in motion"
2229,PROSPECT,"Now for a time on the earth, and every thing seems to be parting."
2230,PROSPECT,E'en in the firmest states fundamental laws are dissolving;
2231,PROSPECT,Property falls away from the hand of the ancient possessor;
2232,PROSPECT,Friend is parted from friend; and so parts lover from lover.
2233,PROSPECT,"Here I leave thee, and where I shall find thee again, or if ever,"
2234,PROSPECT,Who can tell? Perhaps these words are our last ones together.
2235,PROSPECT,"Man's but a stranger here on the earth, we are told and with reason;"
2236,PROSPECT,And we are each of us now become more of strangers than ever.
2237,PROSPECT,"Ours no more is the soil, and our treasures are all of them changing:"
2238,PROSPECT,Silver and gold are melting away from their time-honored patterns.
2239,PROSPECT,All is in motion as though the already-shaped world into chaos
2240,PROSPECT,"Meant to resolve itself backward into night, and to shape itself over."
2241,PROSPECT,"Mine thou wilt keep thine heart, and should we be ever united"
2242,PROSPECT,"Over the ruins of earth, it will be as newly made creatures,"
2243,PROSPECT,"Beings transformed and free, no longer dependent on fortune;"
2244,PROSPECT,For can aught fetter the man who has lived through days such as these are!
2245,PROSPECT,"But if it is not to be, that, these dangers happily over,"
2246,PROSPECT,"Ever again we be granted the bliss of mutual embraces,"
2247,PROSPECT,"Oh, then before thy thoughts so keep my hovering image"
2248,PROSPECT,That with unshaken mind thou be ready for good or for evil!
2249,PROSPECT,"Should new ties allure thee again, and a new habitation,"
2250,PROSPECT,Enter with gratitude into the joys that fate shall prepare thee;
2251,PROSPECT,Love those purely who love thee; be grateful to them who show kindness.
2252,PROSPECT,"But thine uncertain foot should yet be planted but lightly,"
2253,PROSPECT,For there is lurking the twofold pain of a new separation.
2254,PROSPECT,Blessings attend thy life; but value existence no higher
2255,PROSPECT,"Than thine other possessions, and all possessions are cheating!'"
2256,PROSPECT,"Thus spoke the noble youth, and never again I beheld him."
2257,PROSPECT,"Meanwhile I lost my all, and a thousand times thought of his warning."
2258,PROSPECT,"Here, too, I think of his words, when love is sweetly preparing"
2259,PROSPECT,"Happiness for me anew, and glorious hopes are reviving,"
2260,PROSPECT,"Oh forgive me, excellent friend, that e'en while I hold thee"
2261,PROSPECT,Close to my side I tremble! So unto the late-landed sailor
2262,PROSPECT,"Seem the most solid foundations of firmest earth to be rocking."""
2263,PROSPECT,
2264,PROSPECT,"Thus she spoke, and placed the two rings on her finger together."
2265,PROSPECT,But her lover replied with a noble and manly emotion:
2266,PROSPECT,"""So much the firmer then, amid these universal convulsions,"
2267,PROSPECT,"Be, Dorothea, our union! We two will hold fast and continue,"
2268,PROSPECT,"Firmly maintaining ourselves, and the right to our ample possessions."
2269,PROSPECT,"For that man, who, when times are uncertain, is faltering in spirit,"
2270,PROSPECT,"Only increases the evil, and further and further transmits it;"
2271,PROSPECT,"While he refashions the world, who keeps himself steadfastly minded."
2272,PROSPECT,Poorly becomes it the German to give to these fearful excitements
2273,PROSPECT,"Aught of continuance, or to be this way and that way inclining."
2274,PROSPECT,"This is our own! let that be our word, and let us maintain it!"
2275,PROSPECT,"For to those resolute peoples respect will be ever accorded,"
2276,PROSPECT,"Who for God and the laws, for parents, women and children,"
2277,PROSPECT,"Fought and died, as together they stood with their front to the foeman."
2278,PROSPECT,"Thou art mine own; and now what is mine, is mine more than ever."
2279,PROSPECT,"Not with anxiety will I preserve it, and trembling enjoyment;"
2280,PROSPECT,"Rather with courage and strength. To-day should the enemy threaten,"
2281,PROSPECT,"Or in the future, equip me thyself and hand me my weapons."
2282,PROSPECT,"Let me but know that under thy care are my house and dear parents,"
2283,PROSPECT,Oh! I can then with assurance expose my breast to the foeman.
