799,SECT. I.,"Though the poems of Homer are replete, perhaps beyond any others, with"
800,SECT. I.,"refined and often latent adaptations, yet it may be observed in general"
801,SECT. I.,"of the modes of representation used by him, that they are preeminently"
802,SECT. I.,"the reverse of systematic. Institutions or characters, which are in"
803,SECT. I.,"themselves consistent, probably gain by this method of proceeding,"
804,SECT. I.,provided the execution be not unworthy of the design. For it secures
805,SECT. I.,"their exhibition in more, and more varied, points of view, than can"
806,SECT. I.,possibly be covered by the more didactic process. But the possession of
807,SECT. I.,"this advantage depends upon the fact, that there is in them a harmony,"
808,SECT. I.,"which is their base, and which we have only to discover. Whereas, if"
809,SECT. I.,"that harmony be wanting, if in lieu of it there be a groundwork of"
810,SECT. I.,"fundamental discrepancy, then the conditions of effect are wholly"
811,SECT. I.,changed. The multiplied variety of view becomes a multiplication
812,SECT. I.,of incongruity; each new aspect offers a new problem: and the more
813,SECT. I.,"masterly the hand of the artist, the more arduous becomes the attempt"
814,SECT. I.,to comprehend and present in their mutual bearings the pictures he has
815,SECT. I.,"drawn, and the suggestions he has conveyed."
816,SECT. I.,
817,SECT. I.,"Thus it has been with that which, following German example, I have"
818,SECT. I.,denominated the Theo-mythology of Homer. By that term it seems not
819,SECT. I.,"improper to designate a mixture of theology and mythology, as these two"
820,SECT. I.,"words are commonly understood. Theology I suppose to mean, a system"
821,SECT. I.,"dealing with the knowledge of God and the unseen world: mythology, a"
822,SECT. I.,system conversant with the inventions of man concerning them. In the
823,SECT. I.,Homeric poems I find both of these largely displayed: but with this
824,SECT. I.,"difference, that the first was in visible decline, the second in such"
825,SECT. I.,"rapid and prolific development, that, while Homer is undoubtedly a"
826,SECT. I.,"witness to older fable, which had already in his time become settled"
827,SECT. I.,"tradition, he is also in this department himself evidently and largely"
828,SECT. I.,"a Maker and Inventor, and the material of the Greek mythology comes out"
829,SECT. I.,"of his hands far more fully moulded, and far more diversified, than it"
830,SECT. I.,entered them.
831,SECT. I.,
832,SECT. I.,Of the fact that the Homeric religion does not present a consistent and
833,SECT. I.,"homogeneous whole, we have abundant evidence in the difficulties with"
834,SECT. I.,"which, so soon as the literary age of Greece began, expositors found"
835,SECT. I.,themselves incumbered; and which drove them sometimes upon allegory
836,SECT. I.,"as a resource, sometimes, as in the case of Plato, upon censure and"

848,SECT. I.,of dealing with the Homeric poems in this cardinal respect have been
849,SECT. I.,eminently unsatisfactory. Those who have found in Homer the elements of
850,SECT. I.,"religious truth, have resorted to the far-fetched and very extravagant"
851,SECT. I.,"supposition, that he had learned them from the contemporary Hebrews,"
852,SECT. I.,or from the law of Moses. The more common and popular opinion[2] has
853,SECT. I.,"perhaps been one, which has put all such elements almost or altogether"
854,SECT. I.,out of view; one which has treated the Immortals in Homer as so many
855,SECT. I.,"impersonations of the powers of nature, or else magnified men, and"
856,SECT. I.,their social life as in substance no more than as a reflection of his
857,SECT. I.,"picture of heroic life, only gilded with embellishments, and enlarged"
858,SECT. I.,"in scale, in proportion to the superior elevation of its sphere. Few,"
859,SECT. I.,"comparatively, have been inclined to recognise in the Homeric poems the"
860,SECT. I.,"vestiges of a real traditional knowledge, derived from the epoch when"
861,SECT. I.,"the covenant of God with man, and the promise of a Messiah, had not yet"
862,SECT. I.,"fallen within the contracted forms of Judaism for shelter, but entered"

873,SECT. I.,"But surely there is nothing improbable in the supposition, that in"
874,SECT. I.,the poems of Homer such vestiges may be found. Every recorded form of
875,SECT. I.,society bears some traces of those by which it has been preceded: and
876,SECT. I.,"in that highly primitive form, which Homer has been the instrument"
877,SECT. I.,"of embalming for all posterity, the law of general reason obliges us"
878,SECT. I.,to search for elements and vestiges belonging to one more primitive
879,SECT. I.,"still. And, if we are to inquire in the Iliad and the Odyssey for"
880,SECT. I.,"what belongs to antecedent manners and ideas, on what ground can it be"
881,SECT. I.,"pronounced improbable, that no part of these earlier traditions should"
882,SECT. I.,"be old enough to carry upon them the mark of belonging to the religion,"
883,SECT. I.,which the Book of Genesis represents as brought by our first parents
884,SECT. I.,"from Paradise, and as delivered by them to their immediate descendants"
885,SECT. I.,"in general? The Hebrew Chronology, considered in connection with the"
886,SECT. I.,"probable date of Homer, would even render it difficult or irrational"
887,SECT. I.,"to proceed upon any other supposition: nor if, as by the Septuagint"
888,SECT. I.,"or otherwise, a larger period is allowed for the growth of our race,"
889,SECT. I.,will the state of this case be materially altered. For the facts must
890,SECT. I.,"remain, that the form of society exhibited by Homer was itself in"
891,SECT. I.,"many points essentially patriarchal, that it contains, in matter not"
892,SECT. I.,"religious, such, for instance, as the episode of the Cyclops, clear"
893,SECT. I.,traces of a yet earlier condition yet more significant of a relation
894,SECT. I.,"to that name, and that there is no broadly marked period of human"
895,SECT. I.,"experience, or form of manners, which we can place between the great"
896,SECT. I.,"trunk of human history in Holy Scripture, and this famed Homeric"
897,SECT. I.,"branch, which of all literary treasures appears to be its eldest born."
898,SECT. I.,"Standing next to the patriarchal histories of Holy Scripture, why"
899,SECT. I.,"should it not bear, how can it not bear, traces of the religion under"

902,SECT. I.,The immense longevity of the early generations of mankind was eminently

905,SECT. I.,"transmissions from father to son, would observe or share in ten times"
906,SECT. I.,"as many. According to the Hebrew Chronology, Lamech the father of"
907,SECT. I.,Noah was of mature age before Adam died: and Abraham was of mature
908,SECT. I.,"age before Noah died. Original or early witnesses, remaining so long"

922,SECT. I.,"the revelation of the Mosaic law, which was like the erection of a"
923,SECT. I.,"temporary shelter for truths that had ranged at large over the plain,"
924,SECT. I.,and that were apparently in danger of being totally absorbed in the
925,SECT. I.,"mass of human inventions. But before this vineyard was planted, and"
926,SECT. I.,"likewise outside its fence, there were remains, smaller or greater,"
927,SECT. I.,of the knowledge of God; and there was a recognised relation between

932,SECT. I.,"The latest of these indications, such as the visit of the Wise Men from"

938,SECT. I.,"of the Gentiles. Yet even the interest, which probably led to such"
939,SECT. I.,"communications from the Jew, must have had its own root in relics of"
940,SECT. I.,"prior tradition, which attested the common concern of mankind in Him"
941,SECT. I.,"that was to come. But in earlier times, and when the Jewish nation"
942,SECT. I.,"was more concentrated, and was certainly obscure, the vestiges of"
943,SECT. I.,extra-patriarchal and extra-judaical relations between God and man
944,SECT. I.,are undeniable. They have been traced with clearness and ability in a
945,SECT. I.,popular treatise by the hand of Bishop Horsley[4].

952,SECT. I.,"Let us take, for instance, that case of extreme wickedness, which most"
953,SECT. I.,severely tries the general proposition. The punishment of Sodom and
954,SECT. I.,Gomorrah for their sins was preceded by a declaration from the Most
955,SECT. I.,"High, importing a direct relation with those guilty cities[5]; and two"
956,SECT. I.,"angels, who had visited Abraham on the plains of Mamre, ‘came to Sodom"
957,SECT. I.,"at even.’ Ruth the Moabitess was an ancestress, through king David,"
958,SECT. I.,"of our Lord. Rahab in Jericho, ‘by faith,’ as the Apostle assures us,"
959,SECT. I.,"entertained the spies of the Israelites. Job, living in a country"
960,SECT. I.,"where the worship of the sun was practised, had, as had his friends,"
961,SECT. I.,"the knowledge of the true God. Melchizedek, the priest of On, whose"
962,SECT. I.,"daughter Joseph married, and Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, are"
963,SECT. I.,"other conspicuous instances. Later in time, Nineveh, the great Assyrian"
964,SECT. I.,"capital, received the message of the prophet Jonah, and repented at his"
965,SECT. I.,preaching. Here the teaching organ was supplied from among the Jews:
966,SECT. I.,but Balaam exhibits to us the gift of inspiration beyond their bounds.
967,SECT. I.,"Once more; many centuries after the Homeric manners had disappeared,"
968,SECT. I.,"and during the captivity, we find not only a knowledge of God, but"
969,SECT. I.,"dreams and signs vouchsafed to Assyrian kings, and interpreted for"
970,SECT. I.,"them by the prophet Daniel. We have, in short, mingling with the whole"
971,SECT. I.,"course of the Old Testament, a stream of evidence which shows the"
972,SECT. I.,"partial remnants of the knowledge of God, apart from that main current"
973,SECT. I.,of it which is particularly traced for us in the patriarchal and
974,SECT. I.,"Mosaic histories. Again, many centuries after Homer, when all traces"
975,SECT. I.,"of primitive manners had long vanished, still in the Prometheus of"
976,SECT. I.,"Æschylus, and in the Pollio of Virgil, we have signs, though I grant"
977,SECT. I.,"they are faint ones, that the celestial rays had not even then ‘faded"
978,SECT. I.,into the light of common day’ for the heathen world. It would really
979,SECT. I.,"be strange, and that in a high degree, if a record like that of Homer,"
980,SECT. I.,"with so many resemblances to the earliest manners in other points, had"
981,SECT. I.,no link to connect it with them in their most vital part.

993,SECT. I.,which Christendom receives them: and the question immediately before
994,SECT. I.,us is one of pure historical probability. The descent of mankind from
995,SECT. I.,"a single pair, the lapse of that pair from original righteousness,"
996,SECT. I.,are apart from and ulterior to it. We have traced the Greek nation
997,SECT. I.,"to a source, and along a path of migration, which must in all"
998,SECT. I.,"likelihood have placed its ancestry, at some point or points, in close"
999,SECT. I.,local relations with the scenes of the earliest Mosaic records: the
1000,SECT. I.,"retentiveness of that people equalled its receptiveness, and its close"
1001,SECT. I.,and fond association with the past made it prone indeed to incorporate
1002,SECT. I.,"novel matter into its religion, but prone also to keep it there after"
1003,SECT. I.,its incorporation.
1004,SECT. I.,
1005,SECT. I.,"If such traditions existed, and if the laws which guide historical"
1006,SECT. I.,inquiry require or lead us to suppose that the forefathers of the
1007,SECT. I.,"Greeks must have lived within their circle, then the burden of proof"
1008,SECT. I.,must lie not so properly with those who assert that the traces of them
1009,SECT. I.,"are to be found in the earliest, that is, the Homeric, form of the"
1010,SECT. I.,"Greek mythology, as with those who deny it. What became of those old"
1011,SECT. I.,"traditions? They must have decayed and disappeared, not by a sudden"
1012,SECT. I.,"process, but by a gradual accumulation of the corrupt accretions, in"
1013,SECT. I.,which at length they were so completely interred as to be invisible
1014,SECT. I.,"and inaccessible. Some period therefore there must have been, at which"
1015,SECT. I.,"they would remain clearly perceptible, though in conjunction with much"
1016,SECT. I.,"corrupt matter. Such a period might be made the subject of record, and"
1017,SECT. I.,"if such there were, we might naturally expect to find it in the oldest"
1018,SECT. I.,known work of the ancient literature.
1019,SECT. I.,
1020,SECT. I.,"If the poems of Homer do, however, contain a picture, even though a"
1021,SECT. I.,"defaced picture, of the primeval religious traditions, it is obvious"

1023,SECT. I.,"the Holy Scripture, considered as a document of history. Still we must"
1024,SECT. I.,not allow the desire of gaining this advantage to bias the mind in an
1025,SECT. I.,"inquiry, which can only be of value if it is conducted according to the"
1026,SECT. I.,strictest rules of rational criticism.
1027,SECT. I.,
1028,SECT. I.,~_Invention combined with tradition._~
1029,SECT. I.,
1030,SECT. I.,"We may then, in accordance with those rules, be prepared to expect"
1031,SECT. I.,that the Hellenic religion will prove to have been in part constructed
1032,SECT. I.,"from traditional knowledge. The question arises next, Of what other"
1033,SECT. I.,materials in addition was it composed? The answer can be but one;
1034,SECT. I.,Such materials would be supplied by invention. But invention cannot
1035,SECT. I.,absolutely create; it can only work upon what it finds already provided
1036,SECT. I.,to its hand. The provision made in this instance was simply that with
1037,SECT. I.,which the experience of man supplied him. It was mediate or immediate:
1038,SECT. I.,"mediate, where the Greek received matter from abroad, and wrought upon"
1039,SECT. I.,"it: immediate, where he conceived it for himself. That experience lay"
1040,SECT. I.,"in two spheres--the sphere of external nature, and the sphere of life."
1041,SECT. I.,"Each of these would afford for the purpose the elements of Power,"
1042,SECT. I.,"Grandeur, Pleasure, Beauty, Utility; and such would be the elements"
1043,SECT. I.,suited to the work of constructing or developing a system that was to
1044,SECT. I.,present objects for his worship. We may therefore reasonably expect
1045,SECT. I.,to find in the religion features referable to these two departments
1046,SECT. I.,"for their origin;--first, the powerful forces and attractive forms of"
1047,SECT. I.,"outward nature; secondly, the faculties and propensities of man, and"
1048,SECT. I.,"those relations to his fellow-men, amidst which his lot is cast, and"
1049,SECT. I.,his character formed.
1050,SECT. I.,
1051,SECT. I.,"If this be so, then, in the result thus compounded out of tradition"
1052,SECT. I.,"purporting to be revealed, and out of invention strictly human, we"
1053,SECT. I.,"ought to recognise, so long as both classes of ingredients are in"
1054,SECT. I.,"effective coexistence, not strictly a false theology, but a true"
1055,SECT. I.,"theology falsified: a true religion, into which falsehood has entered,"
1056,SECT. I.,and in which it is gradually overlaying and absorbing the original
1057,SECT. I.,"truth, until, when the process has at length reached a certain point,"
1058,SECT. I.,"it is wholly hidden and borne down by countervailing forces, so that"
1059,SECT. I.,"the system has for practical purposes become a false one, and both may"
1060,SECT. I.,and should be so termed and treated.
1061,SECT. I.,
1062,SECT. I.,I admit that very different modes of representing the case have been
1063,SECT. I.,in vogue. Sometimes by those to whom the interest of Christianity
1064,SECT. I.,"is precious, and sometimes in indifference or hostility to its"
1065,SECT. I.,"fortunes, it is held that the basis of the Greek mythology is laid in"
1066,SECT. I.,the deification of the powers of nature. The common assumptions have
1067,SECT. I.,been such as the following: That the starting-point of the religion
1068,SECT. I.,"of the heroic age is to be sought only in the facts of the world, in"
1069,SECT. I.,"the ideas and experience of man. That nature-worship, the deification"
1070,SECT. I.,"of elemental and other physical powers, was the original and proper"
1071,SECT. I.,"basis of the system. That this system, presumably self-consistent,"
1072,SECT. I.,"as having been founded on a given principle, was broken up by the"
1073,SECT. I.,"intervention of theogonic revolutions. That the system, of which"
1074,SECT. I.,"Jupiter was at the head, was an imperfect reconstruction of a scheme of"
1075,SECT. I.,"divine rule out of the fragments of an earlier religion, and that it"
1076,SECT. I.,"supplanted the elder gods. In short, the Greek mythology is represented"
1077,SECT. I.,"as a corrupt edition, not of original revealed religion, but of a"
1078,SECT. I.,"Nature-worship which, as it seems to be assumed, was separated by a"
1079,SECT. I.,"gulf never measured, and never passed, from the primitive religious"
1080,SECT. I.,"traditions of our race. Further it seems to be held, that the faults"
1081,SECT. I.,and imperfections of the pagan religion have their root only in a
1082,SECT. I.,radical inability of the human mind to produce pure deity; that they do
1083,SECT. I.,"not represent the depravation of an ancient and divine gift, but rather"
1084,SECT. I.,"the simple failure of man in a work of invention. Indeed, we need not"
1085,SECT. I.,"wonder that it should fail in a process which, critically considered,"
1086,SECT. I.,can mean little else than mere exaggeration of itself and from its own
1087,SECT. I.,"experience[6], and which must be so apt to become positive caricature."

1095,SECT. I.,"Again, Dean Prideaux, in his Connection of Sacred and Profane History,"
1096,SECT. I.,"gives the following genesis of the Greek mythology. From the beginning,"
1097,SECT. I.,"he says, there was a general notion among men, founded on a sense that"
1098,SECT. I.,"they were impure, of the necessity of a mediator with God. There being"
1099,SECT. I.,"no mediator clearly revealed, man chose mediators for himself, and took"
1100,SECT. I.,"the sun, moon, and stars, as high intelligences well fitted for the"
1101,SECT. I.,"purpose. Hence we find Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Apollo, Mercury, Venus,"
1102,SECT. I.,"and Diana, to be first ranked in the polytheism of the ancients: for"
1103,SECT. I.,they were their first gods[7].
1104,SECT. I.,
1105,SECT. I.,"[7] Prideaux, i. 3. vol. i. p. 198."
1106,SECT. I.,
1107,SECT. I.,This theory is not in correspondence with the facts of the heroic age.
1108,SECT. I.,There is no sense whatever of an impurity disabling men from access
1109,SECT. I.,to God; no clear or general opinion of the necessity of mediation; no
1110,SECT. I.,glimpse even of a god superior to Jupiter and the rest with whom they
1111,SECT. I.,were on behalf of man to mediate.
1112,SECT. I.,
1113,SECT. I.,"And, again, the opinion, that the origin of the religion lay in"
1114,SECT. I.,"Nature-worship, has had the support both of high and also of recent"
1115,SECT. I.,"authorities. The eminent and learned Dr. Döllinger, in his ‘Heidenthum"
1116,SECT. I.,"und Judenthum,’ says, that the deification of Nature, its forces,"
1117,SECT. I.,"or the particular objects it offered to the senses, constituted the"
1118,SECT. I.,"groundwork of the Greek, as well as of the other heathen religions. The"
1119,SECT. I.,"idea of God continued to be powerful even when it had been darkened,"
1120,SECT. I.,"and the godhead was felt as present, and active everywhere in the"
1121,SECT. I.,physical order. In working out his general rule for each mythological
1122,SECT. I.,"deity in particular, this author conceives the original form of their"
1123,SECT. I.,"existence to have been that of a Nature-power, even where the vestiges"
1124,SECT. I.,"of such a conception have, under subsequent handling, become faint"
1125,SECT. I.,"or imperceptible. Thus Juno, Minerva, Latona, Diana, and others in"
1126,SECT. I.,"succession, are referred to such an origin[8]."

1129,SECT. I.,
1130,SECT. I.,"Now in dealing with this hypothesis, I would ask, what then has become"
1131,SECT. I.,of the old Theistic and Messianic traditions? and how has it happened
1132,SECT. I.,they have been amputated by a process so violent as to make them to
1133,SECT. I.,"leave, even while the state of society continued still primitive, no"
1134,SECT. I.,trace behind them? But further. I would urge with confidence that the
1135,SECT. I.,"ample picture of the religion of the heroic ages, as we have it in"
1136,SECT. I.,"Homer, which is strictly for this purpose in the nature of a fact,"
1137,SECT. I.,cannot be made to harmonize with the hypothesis which refers it to
1138,SECT. I.,such a source. The proof of this statement must depend mainly on the
1139,SECT. I.,examination which we have to institute in detail: but I am anxious
1140,SECT. I.,"at once to bring it into view, and to refer briefly to some of the"
1141,SECT. I.,"grounds on which it rests, because it is susceptible of demonstration"
1142,SECT. I.,"by evidence as contradistinguished from theory. On the other hand,"
1143,SECT. I.,"when I proceed farther, evidence and theory must of necessity be mixed"
1144,SECT. I.,up together; and dissent from a particular mode of tracing out the
1145,SECT. I.,association between the traditional and inventive elements of the
1146,SECT. I.,"system might unawares betray the reader into the conclusion, that no"
1147,SECT. I.,"such distinct traditional elements were to be found, but that all,"
1148,SECT. I.,"or nearly all, was pure fable. I say, then, there is much in the"
1149,SECT. I.,"theo-mythology of Homer, which, if it had been a system founded in"
1150,SECT. I.,"fable, could not have appeared there. It stands before us like one of"
1151,SECT. I.,"our old churches, having different parts of its fabric in the different"
1152,SECT. I.,"styles of architecture, each of which speaks for itself, and which we"
1153,SECT. I.,"know to belong to the several epochs in the history of the art, when"
1154,SECT. I.,their characteristic combinations were respectively in vogue.
1155,SECT. I.,
1156,SECT. I.,~_Nor is the system from invention only._~
1157,SECT. I.,
1158,SECT. I.,"While on the one hand it has deities, such as Latona, without any"
1159,SECT. I.,"attributes at all, on the other hand, we find in it both gods and"
1160,SECT. I.,"goddesses, with an assemblage of such attributes and functions as have"
1161,SECT. I.,no common link by which invention could have fastened them together.
1162,SECT. I.,"They are such, likewise, as to bring about cross divisions and cross"
1163,SECT. I.,"purposes, that the Greek force of imagination, and the Greek love of"
1164,SECT. I.,"symmetry, would have alike eschewed. How could invention have set"
1165,SECT. I.,"up Pallas as the goddess at once of peace and its industries, of"
1166,SECT. I.,"wisdom, and of war? Its object would clearly have been to impersonate"
1167,SECT. I.,"attributes; and to associate even distinct, much less conflicting"
1168,SECT. I.,"attributes, in the same deity, would have been simply to confuse them."
1169,SECT. I.,"How again could it have combined in Apollo, who likewise turns the"
1170,SECT. I.,"courses of rivers by his might, the offices of destruction, music,"
1171,SECT. I.,"poetry, prophecy, archery, and medicine? Again, if he is the god of"
1172,SECT. I.,"medicine, why have we Paieon? if of poetry, why have we the Muses? If"
1173,SECT. I.,"Minerva be (as she is) goddess of war, why have we Mars? if of the work"
1174,SECT. I.,"of the Artificer, why have we also Vulcan? if of prudence and sagacity,"
1175,SECT. I.,"and even craft[9], why Mercury?"
1176,SECT. I.,
1177,SECT. I.,[9] Il. xxii. 247.
1178,SECT. I.,
1179,SECT. I.,"And again, the theory is, that the chief personages of the mythology"
1180,SECT. I.,are representatives of the great powers of the physical universe. I
1181,SECT. I.,"ask, therefore, how it happens that in the Homeric, or, as we may call"
1182,SECT. I.,"it, primitive form of the system, these great powers of the universe"
1183,SECT. I.,"are for the most part very indistinctly and partially personified,"
1184,SECT. I.,whereas we see in vivid life and constant movement another set of
1185,SECT. I.,"figures, having either an obscure or partial relation, or no relation"
1186,SECT. I.,"at all, to those powers? Such a state of the evidence surely strikes"
1187,SECT. I.,at the very root of the hypothesis we are considering: but it is
1188,SECT. I.,the state of the evidence which we actually find before us. Take for
1189,SECT. I.,"instance Time, Ocean, Earth, Sun, Moon, Stars, Air; all these prime"
1190,SECT. I.,"natural objects and agents are either not personified at all in Homer,"
1191,SECT. I.,or so indistinctly and mutely personified that they are the mere
1192,SECT. I.,"zoophytes of his supernatural world, of which the gorgeous life and"
1193,SECT. I.,brilliant movement are sustained by a separate set of characters.
1194,SECT. I.,"Of these more effective agents, some are such as it is impossible"
1195,SECT. I.,rationally to set down for mere impersonations of ideas; while others
1196,SECT. I.,"are plainly constituted as lords over, and not beings derivative from,"
1197,SECT. I.,"those powers or provinces of nature, with which they are placed in"
1198,SECT. I.,special relations. It cannot for instance rationally be said that the
1199,SECT. I.,"Homeric Jupiter is a mere impersonation of the air which he rules, or"
1200,SECT. I.,"the Homeric Neptune of the sea, or the Homeric Aidoneus (or Aides) of"
1201,SECT. I.,"the nether world. For to the first of these three, many functions are"
1202,SECT. I.,"assigned having no connection with the air. As for example, when he"
1203,SECT. I.,"gives swiftness of foot to Æneas on Mount Ida, that he might escape"
1204,SECT. I.,"the pursuit of Achilles[10]. In the case of the second, there is a"
1205,SECT. I.,"rival figure, namely, Nereus, who never that we know of leaves the sea,"
1206,SECT. I.,"who is the father of the Sea-nymphs, and who evidently fulfils the"
1207,SECT. I.,"conditions of Sea impersonated far better than does Neptune; Neptune,"
1208,SECT. I.,"who marched upon the battle-field in Troas, and who, with Apollo, had"
1209,SECT. I.,"himself built the walls of Ilium. Besides all this, the sea, to which"
1210,SECT. I.,"Neptune belongs, is itself not one of the great elemental powers of"
1211,SECT. I.,"the universe, but is derived, like rivers, springs, and wells, from"
1212,SECT. I.,"Father Ocean, who fears indeed the thunderbolt of Jupiter, but is not"
1213,SECT. I.,bound to attendance even in the great chapter of Olympus[11]. As
1214,SECT. I.,"to Aidoneus, he can hardly impersonate the nether world, because in"
1215,SECT. I.,"Homer he does not represent or govern it, but only has to do with that"
1216,SECT. I.,"portion of it, which is inhabited by the souls of departed men. For,"
1217,SECT. I.,"as far beneath his realm as Earth is beneath Heaven, lies the dark"
1218,SECT. I.,"Tartarus of Homer, peopled with Κρόνος and his Titans. Nor, on the"
1219,SECT. I.,"other hand, do we know that the Elysian fields of the West were subject"
1220,SECT. I.,"to his sway. The elemental powers are in Homer, though not altogether,"
1221,SECT. I.,"yet almost altogether, extrinsic to his grand Olympian system."

1244,SECT. I.,"transmission of ritual, depending upon outward action, is more easy"
1245,SECT. I.,than that of ideas. But the fact that there was a transmission of
1246,SECT. I.,"something proves that there was a channel for it, open and continuous:"

1273,SECT. I.,by sketching in outline the actual mode of handling the material at
1274,SECT. I.,"command, which resulted in the creation of the Homeric or Olympian"

1279,SECT. I.,
1280,SECT. I.,"So long as either the Sacred Records, or the Light which supplied"
1281,SECT. I.,"them, remained within reach, there were specific means either in"
1282,SECT. I.,"operation, or at least accessible, which, as far as their range"
1283,SECT. I.,"extended, would serve to check error, whether of practice or"
1284,SECT. I.,"speculation, and to clear up uncertainty, as the sundial verifies"
1285,SECT. I.,"or corrects the watch. But the stream darkened more and more, as it"
1286,SECT. I.,got farther from the source. The Pagan religion could boast of its
1287,SECT. I.,"unbroken traditions; like some forms of Christianity, and like the"
1288,SECT. I.,government of France until 1789. But its uninterrupted course was
1289,SECT. I.,really an uninterrupted aberration from the line of truth; and to
1290,SECT. I.,boast of the evenness of its motion was in effect to boast of the
1291,SECT. I.,"deadness of the conscience of mankind, which had not virtue enough even"
1292,SECT. I.,to disturb progressive degeneracy by occasional reproach. In later
1293,SECT. I.,"times, the Pagan system had its three aspects: it was one thing for"
1294,SECT. I.,"the populace, another for statesmen, and a third for philosophers."
1295,SECT. I.,But in Homer’s time it had suffered no criticism and no analysis: the
1296,SECT. I.,human self-consciousness was scarcely awakened; introspection had
1297,SECT. I.,not begun its work. Imagination and affection continually exercised
1298,SECT. I.,their luxuriant energies in enlarging and developing the system of
1299,SECT. I.,preternatural being and action. However copiously the element of
1300,SECT. I.,"fiction, nay, of falsehood, entered into it, yet for the masses of"
1301,SECT. I.,mankind it was still subjectively true[13].

1309,SECT. I.,ardour of its energies in the work of construction: construction of
1310,SECT. I.,"art, construction of manners, construction of polity, construction of"
1311,SECT. I.,"religion. This is what we see, in glowing heat, throughout the poems of"
1312,SECT. I.,"Homer, and it is perhaps the master key to their highest interest. They"
1313,SECT. I.,"show us, in the province we are now considering, heroes earning their"

1315,SECT. I.,"the scheme of supernatural impersonations, and religion allied to the"
1316,SECT. I.,"human imagination, as closely as it was afterwards by Mahomet wedded"
1317,SECT. I.,"to the sword. Everywhere we see that which is properly called myth,"
1318,SECT. I.,in the process of formation. Early mythology is the simple result of
1319,SECT. I.,"the working of the human mind, in a spirit of belief or of credulity,"

1358,SECT. I.,"the uses of power, both mental and physical. Accordingly, the Godhead"
1359,SECT. I.,is for him preternaturally endowed with intelligence and force. But
1360,SECT. I.,how was he to keep alive from his own resources the moral elements

1395,SECT. I.,their supreme perfection to scales of degree: established finite and

1427,SECT. I.,On the one side lay the proposition handed down from the

1430,SECT. I.,was in man what was of Him. It was obvious to look for Him in the
1431,SECT. I.,"mighty agencies, and in the sublime objects of Nature, which, though"
1432,SECT. I.,"(so thought might run,) they did not reveal Him entirely, yet disclosed"
1433,SECT. I.,nothing that was not worthy to belong to Him. Here is a germ of
1434,SECT. I.,"Nature-worship. Hence it is that we find Aristotle, at a period when"
1435,SECT. I.,"thought was alike acute, deliberate, and refined, declare it to be"
1436,SECT. I.,beyond all doubt that the heavenly bodies are far more divine than

1467,SECT. I.,"remote from man, and from his actual state. He therefore lightened the"
1468,SECT. I.,"idea, as it were, by dividing it from one into many; and he brought it"
1469,SECT. I.,"nearer to himself, nearer to his sympathies, by humanizing its form and"
1470,SECT. I.,"attributes. By this process he in time destroyed indeed his reverence,"

1597,SECT. I.,respective functions brought them of necessity to a common ground and
1598,SECT. I.,"a common form of proceeding. Homer saw, heard, or felt the action of"
1599,SECT. I.,"the sun, the moon, the stars, the atmosphere, the winds, the sea, the"
1600,SECT. I.,"rivers, the fountains, the soil; and he knew of family affections, of"
1601,SECT. I.,"governing powers, of a healing art, of a gift and skill of mechanical"
1602,SECT. I.,"construction. Action, in each of these departments, could not but be"
1603,SECT. I.,referred to a power. How was that power to be expressed?

1609,SECT. I.,"At least for the Greek mind, less subtle, as Aristotle has observed,"
1610,SECT. I.,"than the Oriental, it was more natural to deal with persons, than"
1611,SECT. I.,with metaphysical abstractions. It was foreign to the mental habit of
1612,SECT. I.,the heroic age to conceive of abstract essences; as it still remains
1613,SECT. I.,"difficult, more difficult perhaps than, in the looseness of our"
1614,SECT. I.,"mental processes, we suppose, for the men of our own generation. Even"
1615,SECT. I.,"now, in the old age of the world, we have many signs of this natural"
1616,SECT. I.,"difficulty, which formerly was a kind of impossibility. Especially we"
1617,SECT. I.,"have that one which leads all communities, and above all their least"
1618,SECT. I.,"instructed classes, to apply the personal pronouns _he_ or _she_ to a"
1619,SECT. I.,"vast multitude of inanimate objects, both natural, and the products of"
1620,SECT. I.,human skill and labour. These objects are generally such as stand in a
1621,SECT. I.,"certain relation to action: they either do, suffer, or contain."
1622,SECT. I.,
1623,SECT. I.,"If then the Nature-forces could not be expressed, or at least could"
1624,SECT. I.,"not be understood as abstractions, to express them as persons was the"
1625,SECT. I.,only other course open to the poet. It was not an effort to follow
1626,SECT. I.,this method: it would have required great effort to adopt any other.
1627,SECT. I.,How spontaneous was the impulse which thus generated the mythological
1628,SECT. I.,"system, we may observe from this, that it not only personified in cases"
1629,SECT. I.,"where, an agency being seen, its fountain was concealed from view, but"
1630,SECT. I.,it likewise went very far towards personification even in cases where
1631,SECT. I.,"inanimate instruments were wielded by human beings, and where, as the"
1632,SECT. I.,"source of the phenomenon was perceived, there was no occasion to clothe"
1633,SECT. I.,it with a separate vitality. Hence that copious vivifying power which
1634,SECT. I.,Homer has poured like a flood through his verse. Hence his bitter
1635,SECT. I.,"arrow (πικρὸς), his darts hungry for human blood (λιλαιόμενα χρόος"
1636,SECT. I.,"ἆσαι), his ground laughing in the blaze of the gleaming armour (γέλασσε"
1637,SECT. I.,δὲ πᾶσα περὶ χθὼν χαλκοῦ ὑπὸ στεροπῆς). Hence again his free use of
1638,SECT. I.,"sensible imagery to illustrate metaphysical ideas: for example, his"
1639,SECT. I.,"black cloud of grief, his black pains, his purple death[21]. Hence that"
1640,SECT. I.,singularly beautiful passage on the weeping of the deathless horses of
1641,SECT. I.,"Achilles for Patroclus[22]. Hence too it is, that he does not scruple"
1642,SECT. I.,"to carry imagery, drawn from the sphere of one sense, into the domain"
1643,SECT. I.,"of another, an operation which later poets have found so difficult and"
1644,SECT. I.,"hazardous. He has an iron din[23], a brazen voice[24], a brazen or iron"
1645,SECT. I.,"heaven[25], a howling or shouting fire, a blaze of lamentation[26]."
1646,SECT. I.,"Hence, by a system of figure bolder perhaps than has been used by"
1647,SECT. I.,"any other poet, he invests the works of high art in metal with the"
1648,SECT. I.,attributes of life and motion. This daring system reaches its climax
1649,SECT. I.,"in the damsel satellites[27] of gold, that support the limping gait of"
1650,SECT. I.,"Vulcan: in the dogs of metal, that guard the palace of Alcinous: in the"
1651,SECT. I.,"elastic arms of Achilles, which, so far from being a weight upon him,"
1652,SECT. I.,themselves lift him from the ground: and in the animated ships of the
1653,SECT. I.,"Phæacians, which are taught by instinct to speed across the sea, and to"
1654,SECT. I.,pilot their own course to the points of their destination[28]. On every
1655,SECT. I.,"side we see a redundance of life, shaping, and even forcing, for itself"
1656,SECT. I.,new channels: and thus it becomes more easy for us to conceive the
1657,SECT. I.,"important truth that, when he impersonates, he simply takes what was"
1658,SECT. I.,for him the easiest and the most effective way to describe. Every where
1659,SECT. I.,he is carrying on a double process of action and reaction: on the one

1683,SECT. I.,"in recent controversies the use has been so frequent, is capable of"
1684,SECT. I.,being viewed under either of two principal aspects.
1685,SECT. I.,
1686,SECT. I.,"In one of these, it signifies a story which is not contemporary with"
1687,SECT. I.,"the date of the facts it purports to relate, but is in reality an"
1688,SECT. I.,"after-view of them, which colours its subject, and exaggerates, _ad"
1689,SECT. I.,"libitum_, according to conditions of thought and feeling which have"
1690,SECT. I.,arisen in the interval.
1691,SECT. I.,
1692,SECT. I.,"In the other of these senses, it is an allegory which has simply"
1693,SECT. I.,"lost its counterpart: it was true, but by separation from that which"
1694,SECT. I.,"attached it to fact, it has become untrue: being now of necessity"
1695,SECT. I.,"handled, if handled at all, as a substantive existence, it has passed"
1696,SECT. I.,"into a fable, and is only distinguished from pure fable, in that it"
1697,SECT. I.,"once indicated truths contemporary with itself, though probably truths"
1698,SECT. I.,lying in a different region from its own.
1699,SECT. I.,
1700,SECT. I.,"It is in this last sense that the term myth is chiefly, and most"

1703,SECT. I.,in the former sense.

1713,SECT. I.,with a part of it which in the poems themselves carries a cluster of
1714,SECT. I.,"distinctive marks, not to be explained except by the discovery of this"

1720,SECT. I.,"In his learned and acute Essay[29] on Comparative Mythology, Professor"

1722,SECT. I.,exact opposite of Mr. Grote’s ‘Past which was never present.’ If I
1723,SECT. I.,"understand him rightly, there was at some one time a present for every"
1724,SECT. I.,"portion of the reputed past[30]: so that, by a reference to eastern"
1725,SECT. I.,"sources, the nature of that present, and of the original consistent"
1726,SECT. I.,meaning for what afterwards on becoming unintelligible is justly called
1727,SECT. I.,"a myth, has in many cases been, and may yet in many more come to be,"
1728,SECT. I.,"unveiled. Originally impersonations of ideas and natural powers, the"
1729,SECT. I.,"heathen gods never represented demons or evil spirits[31], and were"
1730,SECT. I.,"‘masks without an actor,’ ‘names without being:’ while their reality,"
1731,SECT. I.,"consisting in their relation to the facts of the universe, faded and"
1732,SECT. I.,escaped from perception in the course of time. The myths of the Veda
1733,SECT. I.,are still in the stage of growth: Hesiod and Homer too are of the
1734,SECT. I.,"‘later Greeks,’ and not only the Theogony of Hesiod is ‘a distorted"

1760,SECT. I.,
1761,SECT. I.,"Upon the other hand, as there was already a true religion in the world"
1762,SECT. I.,"when an untrue one began to gather upon and incrust it, there must"
1763,SECT. I.,"arise the question already put; what, according to the theory before"

1765,SECT. I.,"there was no wilful renunciation of it by single or specific acts,"
1766,SECT. I.,no sharp line drawn between it and the false; but the human element
1767,SECT. I.,"was gradually more and more imported into the divine, operating by"
1768,SECT. I.,continual and successive disintegrations of the original ideas. If
1769,SECT. I.,"so, then there seems to be nothing unreasonable in the belief that"

1773,SECT. I.,
1774,SECT. I.,"No doubt it would be unreasonable to look for such traces in Homer,"

1777,SECT. I.,with a mythological system of which his nation had already had its
1778,SECT. I.,"use, from which the creative principle had departed, and which was on"
1779,SECT. I.,the road from ripeness to decay. I am far from saying that there are

1781,SECT. I.,to be discernible: but I shall seek to show that the contrary may be
1782,SECT. I.,"confidently averred, and fully shown, with respect to the great bulk"
1783,SECT. I.,"of his mythology, and that we see in him two systems, both alive, and"
1784,SECT. I.,"in impact and friction, though with very unequal forces, one upon the"
1785,SECT. I.,"other; the first, that of traditional truth, and the second, of the"
1786,SECT. I.,inventive impersonation of nature both material and invisible. And
1787,SECT. I.,"certainly it is very striking that, with one or two very insignificant"
1788,SECT. I.,"exceptions, all those ancient fables, which Professor Müller treats as"
1789,SECT. I.,"having become unintelligible without the key of the Veda, and which he"
1790,SECT. I.,"explains by means of it, are fables unknown to Homer, and drawn from"

1794,SECT. I.,
1795,SECT. I.,"The general view, then, which will be given in these pages of the"
1796,SECT. I.,Homeric Theo-mythology is as follows: That its basis is not to be
1797,SECT. I.,found either in any mere human instinct gradually building it up
1798,SECT. I.,"from the ground, or in the already formed system of any other nation"
1799,SECT. I.,of antiquity; but that its true point of origin lies in the ancient
1800,SECT. I.,"Theistic and Messianic traditions, which we know to have subsisted"
1801,SECT. I.,"among the patriarchs, and which their kin and contemporaries must have"
1802,SECT. I.,"carried with them as they dispersed, although their original warmth"
1803,SECT. I.,"and vitality could not but fall into a course of gradual efflux, with"
1804,SECT. I.,the gradually widening distance from their source. To travel beyond the
1805,SECT. I.,reach of the rays proceeding from that source was to make the first
1806,SECT. I.,decisive step from religion to mythology.
1807,SECT. I.,
1808,SECT. I.,"To this divine tradition, then, were added, in rank abundance, elements"
1809,SECT. I.,"of merely human fabrication, which, while intruding themselves, could"
1810,SECT. I.,not but also extrude the higher and prior parts of religion. But the
1811,SECT. I.,"divine tradition, as it was divine, would not admit of the accumulation"
1812,SECT. I.,of human materials until it had itself been altered. Even before men
1813,SECT. I.,"could add, it was necessary that they should take away. This impairing"
1814,SECT. I.,and abstraction of elements from the divine tradition may be called
1815,SECT. I.,disintegration.
1816,SECT. I.,
1817,SECT. I.,"Before the time of Homer, it had already wrought great havock. Its"
1818,SECT. I.,"first steps, as far as the genesis of the mythology throws light upon"
1819,SECT. I.,"them, would appear to have been as follows: objectively, a fundamental"
1820,SECT. I.,"corruption of the idea of God; who, instead of an Omnipotent wisdom and"
1821,SECT. I.,"holiness, now in the main represented on a large scale, in personal"
1822,SECT. I.,"character, the union of appetite and power; subjectively, the primary"
1823,SECT. I.,"idea of religion was wholly lost. Adam, says Lord Bacon, was not"
1824,SECT. I.,content with universal obedience to the Divine Will as his rule of
1825,SECT. I.,"action, but would have another standard. This offence, though not"
1826,SECT. I.,"exaggerated into the hideousness of human depravity in its later forms,"
1827,SECT. I.,is represented without mitigation in the principles of action current
1828,SECT. I.,"in the heroic age. Human life, as it is there exhibited, has much in"
1829,SECT. I.,it that is noble and admirable; but nowhere is it a life of simple
1830,SECT. I.,obedience to God.
1831,SECT. I.,
1832,SECT. I.,"This disintegration of primitive traditions forms the second stage, a"
1833,SECT. I.,"negative one, in the process which produced the Homeric Theo-mythology."
1834,SECT. I.,
1835,SECT. I.,"When the divine idea, and also the idea of the relation between man and"
1836,SECT. I.,"his Maker, had once been fundamentally changed, there was now room for"
1837,SECT. I.,the introduction without limit of what was merely human into religion.
1838,SECT. I.,"Instead of man’s being formed in the image of God, God was formed in"
1839,SECT. I.,the image of man. The ancient traditions were made each to assume a
1840,SECT. I.,separate individual form; and these shapes were fashioned by magnifying
1841,SECT. I.,and modifying processes from the pattern that human nature afforded.
1842,SECT. I.,
1843,SECT. I.,"Again, as man does not exist alone and individually, but in the family,"
1844,SECT. I.,so the _nexus_ of the family was introduced as the basis of a divine
1845,SECT. I.,"order. This we may call, resting on the etymology of the word, the"
1846,SECT. I.,divine Œconomy of the Homeric religion.
1847,SECT. I.,
1848,SECT. I.,"But as with man, so with the supernatural world, on which his own"
1849,SECT. I.,"genius was now powerfully reflected, families themselves, when"
1850,SECT. I.,"multiplied, required a political order; and therefore, among the gods"
1851,SECT. I.,"also a State and government are formed, a divine polity. Human care, by"
1852,SECT. I.,"a strange inversion, makes parental provision for the good government"
1853,SECT. I.,of those deities whom it has called into being.
1854,SECT. I.,
1855,SECT. I.,"The propagation, for which a physical provision was made among men,"
1856,SECT. I.,"takes place within the mythological circle also, under the laws of his"
1857,SECT. I.,intelligent nature. The ranks of the Immortals are filled with persons
1858,SECT. I.,metaphysically engendered. These persons they represent concrete
1859,SECT. I.,"forms given to abstract ideas, or, to state nearly the same thing in"
1860,SECT. I.,"other words, personal modes of existence assigned to powers which"
1861,SECT. I.,"man saw as it were alive and at work in the universe, physical or"
1862,SECT. I.,"intelligent, around him. But here too a distinction is to be observed."
1863,SECT. I.,"Sometimes the deity was set above the natural power, as its governor"
1864,SECT. I.,and controller: sometimes he merely signified the power itself put in
1865,SECT. I.,action. The former mode commonly points to tradition; the latter always
1866,SECT. I.,to invention.
1867,SECT. I.,
1868,SECT. I.,"And lastly, when a supernatural κοσμὸς or order had thus been"
1869,SECT. I.,"constructed, the principles of affinity between it and the order here"
1870,SECT. I.,below exercised a reciprocally attractive force. The gods were more and
1871,SECT. I.,"more humanized, man was more and more invested with deity: deity was"
1872,SECT. I.,"made cheap and common among men, and the interval from earth to heaven"
1873,SECT. I.,"was bridged over by various means. These means were principally; first,"
1874,SECT. I.,"the translation of men into the company of the immortals; secondly, the"
1875,SECT. I.,"introduction of intermediate races; and, thirdly and most of all, the"
1876,SECT. I.,deification of heroes.
1877,SECT. I.,
1878,SECT. I.,"Subordinate to this general view, there arises another question: how"
1879,SECT. I.,are we to subdivide the inventive parts of the Homeric mythology? What
1880,SECT. I.,"general statements can be propounded, or criteria supplied, to show how"
1881,SECT. I.,"much Greece fabricated or moulded for herself, and what she owed to"
1882,SECT. I.,"Egypt, or to Phœnicia, or to other lands in the East, whose traditions"
1883,SECT. I.,she had either inherited or received?
1884,SECT. I.,
1885,SECT. I.,~_Sources of the inventive portions._~
1886,SECT. I.,
1887,SECT. I.,A deep obscurity hangs over this subject. We do not know all that
1888,SECT. I.,was contained in each of the various religions of the East at any
1889,SECT. I.,"one epoch, much less at all the periods within which they may have"
1890,SECT. I.,contributed materials to the gorgeous fabric of Homer. Many things
1891,SECT. I.,"were probably common to several of them: and where this was so,"
1892,SECT. I.,circumstantial evidence cannot avail for determining the source at
1893,SECT. I.,which the Poet or his nation borrowed.
1894,SECT. I.,
1895,SECT. I.,"But several propositions may be laid down, which will tend towards"
1896,SECT. I.,describing the path of our inquiry.
1897,SECT. I.,
1898,SECT. I.,"First, the accounts which, transmitted by Herodotus, represent Egypt as"
1899,SECT. I.,"the fountain-head of the Greek religion in its mass, are not sustained"
1900,SECT. I.,by the evidence of Homer. And even with respect to many points where
1901,SECT. I.,the nucleus of the Greek system has something corresponding with it
1902,SECT. I.,"in the Egyptian, it neither follows that it was originally drawn from"
1903,SECT. I.,"Egypt by the Greeks, nor that those from whom the Greeks received"
1904,SECT. I.,it had obtained it there. Yet there remains room for very important
1905,SECT. I.,"communications, such, for example, as the oracle of Dodona, or the"
1906,SECT. I.,"worship of Minerva, which may be an historic token of an Egyptian"
1907,SECT. I.,colony at Athens.
1908,SECT. I.,
1909,SECT. I.,"Secondly, the correspondences between the Homeric system and the"
1910,SECT. I.,"Eastern religions, as we know them, are commonly latent, rather than"
1911,SECT. I.,"broad or palpable. This may, in part, be owing to the circumstance that"
1912,SECT. I.,our accounts of these religions are in great part so much later than
1913,SECT. I.,"Homer; and a greater resemblance, than is now to be traced, may have"
1914,SECT. I.,subsisted in his time.
1915,SECT. I.,
1916,SECT. I.,~_Originality of the Olympian system._~
1917,SECT. I.,
1918,SECT. I.,"But, thirdly, the differences are not differences of detail or degree."
1919,SECT. I.,"A different spirit pervades the Homeric creed and worship, from that"
1920,SECT. I.,"which we find in Egyptian, or Median, or Persian systems. One has"
1921,SECT. I.,"grovelling animalism, another has metaphysical aspirations, that we"
1922,SECT. I.,do not find in the Greek: but this is not all. If the Homeric scheme
1923,SECT. I.,"is capable of being described, as to its inventive part, by any one"
1924,SECT. I.,"epithet, it will be this, that it is intensely human. I do not speak"
1925,SECT. I.,"of the later mythology; nor of Hesiod, whose Theogony so marvellously"
1926,SECT. I.,"spoils what it systematizes; but of Homer, in whom the ideal Olympus"
1927,SECT. I.,attained its perfection at a stroke. In his preternatural κοσμὸς there
1928,SECT. I.,"is, as far as I can see, much more of what is truly Divine, much more"
1929,SECT. I.,"of the residue of primeval tradition, than we can find collected"
1930,SECT. I.,elsewhere: but there is also much more of what is human. The moral
1931,SECT. I.,form is corrupt: but I am now also speaking of it as a work of human
1932,SECT. I.,"genius, and certainly as one of the most wonderful and splendid of"
1933,SECT. I.,"its products. The deep sympathy with Nature, the refined perception"
1934,SECT. I.,"of beauty, the freedom, the buoyancy, the elastic movement of every"
1935,SECT. I.,"figure on the scene, the intimate sense of association between the"
1936,SECT. I.,"denizens of Olympus and the generations of mortal men, the imposing"
1937,SECT. I.,"development of a Polity on high, the vivid nationality that riveted"
1938,SECT. I.,"its hold on Greece, the richness and inexhaustible diversity of those"
1939,SECT. I.,"embellishments which a vigorous fancy knows how to provide, combine to"
1940,SECT. I.,"make good the title I have asserted, and, if we are to believe that"
1941,SECT. I.,"Homer, in no small part, made what he described, must place his share"
1942,SECT. I.,in the formation of the system in the very foremost rank even of his
1943,SECT. I.,achievements.
1944,SECT. I.,
1945,SECT. I.,"At any rate, this one thing, I think, is clear; that whatever Greece"
1946,SECT. I.,"borrowed from the East, she fairly made her own. All was thrown"
1947,SECT. I.,"into the crucible; all came out again from the fire recast, in such"
1948,SECT. I.,"combinations, and clothed in such forms and hues, as the specific"
1949,SECT. I.,exigencies of the Greek mind required. Hence we must beware of all
1950,SECT. I.,"precipitate identifications. We must take good heed, for example,"
1951,SECT. I.,"not to assume, that because Athene may be Neith by metathesis,"
1952,SECT. I.,therefore the features of the Homeric Pallas were really gathered
1953,SECT. I.,together in the Egyptian prototype of her name[33]. The strong hand
1954,SECT. I.,of a transmuting fancy and intelligence passed as a preliminary
1955,SECT. I.,"condition upon everything foreign, not only to modify, but probably"
1956,SECT. I.,"also to resolve into parts, and then to reconstruct. So that the"
1957,SECT. I.,"preternatural system of Homer is, above all others, both national and"
1958,SECT. I.,"original, and has, by its own vital energies, helped to maintain those"
1959,SECT. I.,characteristics even in the deteriorated copies which were made from it
1960,SECT. I.,by so many after-generations.

1977,SECT. II.,
1978,SECT. II.,From the general expectation which prevailed in the East at the
1979,SECT. II.,"period of the Advent, and from the prophecies collected and carefully"
1980,SECT. II.,"preserved in Rome under the name of the Sibylline books, we are at"
1981,SECT. II.,"once led to presume, that the knowledge of the early promise of a"
1982,SECT. II.,Deliverer had not been confined to the Jewish nation. Their exclusive
1983,SECT. II.,"character, and that of their religion; their small significance in the"
1984,SECT. II.,political system and intellectual movement of the world; and the false
1985,SECT. II.,as well as imperfect notions which seem to have prevailed elsewhere
1986,SECT. II.,respecting them and their law[34]; all make it highly improbable that
1987,SECT. II.,these expectations and predictions should have been drawn from them
1988,SECT. II.,"and their sacred books exclusively. Further, Holy Scripture distinctly"
1989,SECT. II.,exhibits to us the existence of channels of traditional knowledge
1990,SECT. II.,severed from theirs. Thus much we learn particularly from the cases of
1991,SECT. II.,"Job, who was a prophet and servant of God, though he lived in a country"
1992,SECT. II.,"where idolatry was practised[35]; and of Balaam, who, not being an"
1993,SECT. II.,"Israelite, nor an upright man, was nevertheless a prophet also. Our"
1994,SECT. II.,"Lord, in his answer respecting God as the God of Abraham[36], points"
1995,SECT. II.,"to a great article of belief, not expressly propounded in the Mosaic"
1996,SECT. II.,"books. And again, there are traditions adopted in the New Testament by"
1997,SECT. II.,"apostolic authority, which prove to us that there were some fragments"
1998,SECT. II.,"at least of early tradition remaining, even at a late date, among the"
1999,SECT. II.,"Jews themselves, over and above what had been committed to writing"
2000,SECT. II.,in the older Scriptures. Such are those given by St. Jude respecting
2001,SECT. II.,"Balaam himself, the body of Moses, and the prophecy of Enoch[37]. Such"
2002,SECT. II.,"is the record mentioned by St. Paul[38] of Jannes and Jambres, who are"
2003,SECT. II.,"believed to have been the chief magicians of Pharaoh, referred to in"
2004,SECT. II.,"Exodus, c. vii: and whose names are mentioned by Pliny, and, according"
2005,SECT. II.,"to Eusebius, by Numenius the Philosopher[39]. But it is not necessary,"
2006,SECT. II.,"and it might not be safe, to make any large assumption respecting a"
2007,SECT. II.,traditional knowledge of any parts of early revelation beyond what
2008,SECT. II.,Scripture actually contains.

2031,SECT. II.,"And first, as to the Deliverer of man. The Redeemer promised was to"
2032,SECT. II.,"be human, for He was to be of human birth. As death was the type of"
2033,SECT. II.,"the primeval curse, so it was from death that He was to deliver."
2034,SECT. II.,"Again, the woman became a portion of the prophecy, for He was to be"
2035,SECT. II.,the seed of the woman: and while He is thus plainly indicated to us as
2036,SECT. II.,"incarnate, He is, on the other hand, mysteriously identified with the"
2037,SECT. II.,"Λόγος, the Divine Word or Wisdom, existing before the world and the"
2038,SECT. II.,"race with which He was to be numbered, and invested with the attributes"
2039,SECT. II.,of supreme Deity. Although from a certain period the Wisdom and the
2040,SECT. II.,"Deliverer appear to stand visibly identified, yet the earliest forms of"
2041,SECT. II.,"the traditions, as they stand in Holy Writ, are, to a certain extent,"
2042,SECT. II.,ideally separate or separable; and the personality of the former is

2044,SECT. II.,
2045,SECT. II.,It was always the prevailing tendency of the speculative religions of
2046,SECT. II.,the East to withdraw the Supreme Being from direct relations with the
2047,SECT. II.,"world, and to assign its ordinary government to the Wisdom, more or"
2048,SECT. II.,"less directly impersonated. ‘This,’ says Dean Milman, ‘was the doctrine"
2049,SECT. II.,"from the Ganges, or even the shores of the Yellow Sea, to the Ilissus:"
2050,SECT. II.,it was the fundamental principle of the Indian religion and Indian
2051,SECT. II.,philosophy; it was the basis of Zoroastrianism: it was pure Platonism:

2067,SECT. II.,~_Sum of the primitive traditions._~
2068,SECT. II.,
2069,SECT. II.,We may venture rudely to sum up these principal traditions of the first
2070,SECT. II.,ages as follows:
2071,SECT. II.,
2072,SECT. II.,"First, with respect to the Deity."
2073,SECT. II.,
2074,SECT. II.,1. The Unity and supremacy of the Godhead.
2075,SECT. II.,
2076,SECT. II.,"2. A combination with this Unity of a Trinity, in which Trinity the"
2077,SECT. II.,"several Persons, in whatever way their personality be understood, and"
2078,SECT. II.,"whatever distinctions may obtain between them, are in some way of"
2079,SECT. II.,coequal honour.
2080,SECT. II.,
2081,SECT. II.,"Secondly, with respect to the Redeemer, or Messiah."
2082,SECT. II.,
2083,SECT. II.,"1. A Redeemer from the curse of death, invested with full humanity,"
2084,SECT. II.,"by whom the divine kingdom was to be vindicated and reestablished, in"
2085,SECT. II.,despite of its enemies.
2086,SECT. II.,
2087,SECT. II.,"2. A Wisdom, which is personal as well as divine, the highest and"
2088,SECT. II.,"first in order, concerned in the foundation and continuing government"
2089,SECT. II.,of the world[42]. This is the Wisdom which ‘the Lord possessed from
2090,SECT. II.,"everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was[43].’ ‘I Wisdom"
2091,SECT. II.,dwell with prudence; and find out knowledge of witty inventions[44].’
2092,SECT. II.,‘This is with all flesh according to his gift: and he hath given her to
2093,SECT. II.,them that love him[45].’
2094,SECT. II.,
2095,SECT. II.,[42] Proverbs i. 20-33.
2096,SECT. II.,
2097,SECT. II.,[43] Proverbs iii. 19.
2098,SECT. II.,
2099,SECT. II.,[44] See Proverbs viii. _passim_.
2100,SECT. II.,
2101,SECT. II.,"[45] Ecclus. i. 8-10. iv. 11-19, _et alibi._ See also Wisdom of"
2102,SECT. II.,"Solomon, i. 6. vi. 12, and seqq. vii.-x. _passim_."
2103,SECT. II.,
2104,SECT. II.,3. The connection of the Redeemer with our race through his descent
2105,SECT. II.,from the woman.
2106,SECT. II.,
2107,SECT. II.,"Thirdly, with respect to the Evil One."
2108,SECT. II.,
2109,SECT. II.,1. A rebellion of great angels or powers against the Supreme Being; the
2110,SECT. II.,"defeat of the rebels, and their being cast into the abyss."
2111,SECT. II.,
2112,SECT. II.,2. The going forth among men of a power who tempts them to their
2113,SECT. II.,destruction.
2114,SECT. II.,
2115,SECT. II.,"A tradition of minor moment, but clearly declared in the earliest"
2116,SECT. II.,"Scripture, may be added: namely,"
2117,SECT. II.,
2118,SECT. II.,"The announcement of the rainbow, as a token which was to convey an"
2119,SECT. II.,"assurance or covenant from God to man, with respect to the annual order"
2120,SECT. II.,of nature; an order on which the continuance of the human race depends.
2121,SECT. II.,
2122,SECT. II.,"It is impossible to survey these traditions, in their outline, without"
2123,SECT. II.,"seeing how easy it was to find a way from them, by the aid of ideas on"
2124,SECT. II.,"which they seemed to border, and which they brought within easy reach"
2125,SECT. II.,"of wayward thought, towards the principal corruptions of heathenism."
2126,SECT. II.,"They shadow forth, as they stand, the great dogmas of the Trinity and"
2127,SECT. II.,"the Incarnation: but from the doctrine of the Trinity, thus shadowed"
2128,SECT. II.,"forth, the next step might be into polytheism; while in the doctrine of"
2129,SECT. II.,"the Incarnation, similarly projected, seemed to be laid the foundation"
2130,SECT. II.,"of the Greek anthropomorphism, or the reflection of humanity upon"
2131,SECT. II.,the supernatural world. Abstract truth has not been found sufficient
2132,SECT. II.,to sustain itself among mankind: and in the dispensations of the
2133,SECT. II.,All-Wise the promulgation of it has always been associated with the
2134,SECT. II.,"establishment of a teaching organ, which should bear living witness to"
2135,SECT. II.,its authority.
2136,SECT. II.,
2137,SECT. II.,Let us now observe how these traditions severally find their imperfect
2138,SECT. II.,and deranged counterparts in the heroic age of Greece.
2139,SECT. II.,
2140,SECT. II.,"First, as to the Godhead."
2141,SECT. II.,
2142,SECT. II.,"Its unity and supremacy is represented in Jupiter, as the administrator"
2143,SECT. II.,of sovereign power.
2144,SECT. II.,
2145,SECT. II.,The combination of Trinity with Unity is reproduced in the three
2146,SECT. II.,"Kronid brothers, Jupiter, Neptune, Pluto or Aidoneus; all born of the"
2147,SECT. II.,"same parents, and having different regions of the material creation"
2148,SECT. II.,severally assigned to them by lot.
2149,SECT. II.,
2150,SECT. II.,Next as to the Redeemer.
2151,SECT. II.,
2152,SECT. II.,The first form of this tradition is represented chiefly in Apollo.
2153,SECT. II.,But neither the various attributes which were conceived as belonging
2154,SECT. II.,"to the Deliverer, nor the twofold manifestation of his character"
2155,SECT. II.,"as it appears in Holy Writ, could, we must conclude, be held in"
2156,SECT. II.,"combination by the heathen mind. The character, therefore, underwent a"
2157,SECT. II.,marked disintegration by severance into distinct parts: and while it
2158,SECT. II.,"continues, in the main, to form the groundwork of the Homeric Apollo,"
2159,SECT. II.,certain of its qualities are apparently transferred to his sister
2160,SECT. II.,"Diana, and others of them are, as it were, repeated in her."
2161,SECT. II.,
2162,SECT. II.,"The second form of the tradition is that of the Wisdom, or Λόγος, of"
2163,SECT. II.,the Gospel of Saint John; and this appears to be represented in the
2164,SECT. II.,sublime Minerva of the Homeric system.
2165,SECT. II.,
2166,SECT. II.,"Lastly, Latona, the mother of the twin deities, Apollo and Diana,"
2167,SECT. II.,"appears to represent the tradition of the woman, from whom the"
2168,SECT. II.,Deliverer was to descend.
2169,SECT. II.,
2170,SECT. II.,"Thirdly, with respect to the Evil One."
2171,SECT. II.,
2172,SECT. II.,"As the derivative idea of sin depended upon that of goodness, and as"
2173,SECT. II.,the shadow ceases to be visible when the object shadowed has become
2174,SECT. II.,"more dim, we might well expect that the contraction and obscuration of"
2175,SECT. II.,the true idea of goodness would bring about a more than proportionate
2176,SECT. II.,loss of knowledge concerning the true nature of evil. The impersonation
2177,SECT. II.,"of evil could only be upheld in a lively or effectual manner, as the"
2178,SECT. II.,opposite of the impersonation of good: and when the moral standard of
2179,SECT. II.,"godhead had so greatly degenerated, as we find to be the case even in"
2180,SECT. II.,"the works of Homer, the negation of that standard could not but cease"
2181,SECT. II.,to be either interesting or intelligible.
2182,SECT. II.,
2183,SECT. II.,~_Traditions of the Evil One in Homer._~
2184,SECT. II.,
2185,SECT. II.,"Accordingly we find that the process of disintegration, followed"
2186,SECT. II.,"by that of arbitrary reassortment and combination of elements, had"
2187,SECT. II.,proceeded to a more advanced stage with respect to the tradition of the
2188,SECT. II.,"Evil One, than in the other cases."
2189,SECT. II.,
2190,SECT. II.,The general form of the disintegration is this: that the idea of a
2191,SECT. II.,"rebellion, menacing the divine dominion with violence, is now clothed"
2192,SECT. II.,in a variety of detached and more or less conflicting forms: while
2193,SECT. II.,the far more subtle idea of an influence acting immediately on the
2194,SECT. II.,"spirit of man, and aiming a blow at the glory of the Deity through his"
2195,SECT. II.,"creatures, whose allegiance it seeks by the perversion of their own"
2196,SECT. II.,"spontaneous agency to withdraw, remains in Homer, still indeed both"
2197,SECT. II.,"visible and single, but enfeebled and obscured to such a degree, that"
2198,SECT. II.,"it, as it were, stands on tiptoe, ready for its final flight from the"
2199,SECT. II.,sphere of the common perceptions of mankind.
2200,SECT. II.,
2201,SECT. II.,"The first, the idea of evil acting by violence, is represented, not"
2202,SECT. II.,"indeed exclusively, but most conspicuously, in the Titans and Giants."
2203,SECT. II.,
2204,SECT. II.,"The second, or the idea of evil acting by deceit, is represented in the"
2205,SECT. II.,Ἄτη of Homer.
2206,SECT. II.,
2207,SECT. II.,Lastly: the rainbow of Holy Scripture is represented in the Homeric
2208,SECT. II.,Iris.
2209,SECT. II.,
2210,SECT. II.,"These, then, speaking generally, are the principal remnants from"
2211,SECT. II.,"primitive traditions, of which, if of any thing of the kind, we may"
2212,SECT. II.,expect to find the vestiges within the Olympian Court.
2213,SECT. II.,
2214,SECT. II.,~_Varying degrees of the traditive character._~
2215,SECT. II.,
2216,SECT. II.,"In order to throw a fuller light upon the subject, I shall chiefly"
2217,SECT. II.,"examine the characters of the Homeric deities, and of the more"
2218,SECT. II.,"important among them in particular, not as a body but individually."
2219,SECT. II.,An opposite practice has for the most part prevailed. It has been
2220,SECT. II.,"assumed that they are homogeneous; they have been treated as a class,"
2221,SECT. II.,"subject to the same laws; and variations, not to be accounted for"
2222,SECT. II.,"from mythological _data_, have been viewed as mere solecisms in the"
2223,SECT. II.,"conception of the class. This has mainly tended, I believe, to thrust"
2224,SECT. II.,the truth of the case into dark corners. But the properties which
2225,SECT. II.,distinguish the Homeric Immortals in common from men are in reality
2226,SECT. II.,less important than those which establish rules of discrimination
2227,SECT. II.,"within their own body, and which point to the very different sources"
2228,SECT. II.,that have supplied the materials incorporated into different portions
2229,SECT. II.,of the scheme.
2230,SECT. II.,
2231,SECT. II.,"In the enumeration which it will be requisite to make, it might be"
2232,SECT. II.,"allowable to treat Neptune and Pluto as traditive divinities, because"
2233,SECT. II.,"in their relation to Jupiter, which abstractedly is one of equal birth"
2234,SECT. II.,"and equal honour, they appear to share in representing the primitive"
2235,SECT. II.,"tradition, which combined a trine personality with unity in the"
2236,SECT. II.,godhead. Effect was given to this tradition by supposing the existence
2237,SECT. II.,"of three deities, who were united by the bond of brotherhood, and of"
2238,SECT. II.,whom each had an important portion of the universe assigned to his
2239,SECT. II.,immediate superintendence. But for the assignment of attributes to
2240,SECT. II.,"these personages, when severally constituted, tradition seems to have"
2241,SECT. II.,"afforded no aid. Jupiter, as the eldest and most powerful, became heir"
2242,SECT. II.,"general, as it were, to whatever ideas were current respecting the one"
2243,SECT. II.,"supreme God: or the point might be otherwise stated, as for instance"
2244,SECT. II.,"thus, that the conception which the Greeks derived from elsewhere of a"
2245,SECT. II.,"supreme God, they, on taking it over, shaped into the Eldest Brother of"
2246,SECT. II.,their Trinity. But the concentration of ideas of supremacy upon him was
2247,SECT. II.,"at variance with, and enfeebled the notion of, the trine combination."
2248,SECT. II.,"The tradition itself, moreover, did not determine provinces for"
2249,SECT. II.,"Neptune or Pluto; and consequently, though these deities may be"
2250,SECT. II.,"considered traditional with regard to their basis, they belonged to"
2251,SECT. II.,"the invented class as respects character and attributes, and it is in"
2252,SECT. II.,conjunction with that class that I propose to consider them.
2253,SECT. II.,
2254,SECT. II.,"Again, Jupiter does not fully represent any one specific tradition: but"
2255,SECT. II.,he assembles irregularly around him the fragments of such traditions as
2256,SECT. II.,belonged to the relation between men and the One Ruler of the universe.
2257,SECT. II.,On the one hand he is in competition with other impersonations; on the
2258,SECT. II.,"other hand, with abstractions, which, if they wanted the life, yet had"
2259,SECT. II.,not forfeited the purity of godhead.
2260,SECT. II.,
2261,SECT. II.,"Latona, again, will be known rather by relative and negative, than by"
2262,SECT. II.,"absolute and positive, signs; except as to the point of her maternity."
2263,SECT. II.,
2264,SECT. II.,"So Diana does not equally divide with Apollo, her twin brother, the"
2265,SECT. II.,substance of the tradition that they jointly represent; but rather is
2266,SECT. II.,"the figure of a person on whom the residue, consisting of properties"
2267,SECT. II.,"that the Homeric Apollo could not receive, is bestowed. It is mainly in"
2268,SECT. II.,her ancillary relation to Apollo that she should be viewed.
2269,SECT. II.,
2270,SECT. II.,"It will of course be my object to bring out, as clearly and fully as"
2271,SECT. II.,"I can, that portion of the evidence, which proves the presence of a"
2272,SECT. II.,strong traditive element in the Theomythology of Homer.
2273,SECT. II.,
2274,SECT. II.,But it is not free from difficulty to determine the best mode of
2275,SECT. II.,proceeding with this view. The traditive part of the materials is not
2276,SECT. II.,separated by a broad and direct line from the inventive; nor has it
2277,SECT. II.,been lodged without admixture in any of the members of the Olympian
2278,SECT. II.,"system. Like the fables of the East, it has undergone the transforming"
2279,SECT. II.,"action of the Greek mind, and it is throughout the scheme variously"
2280,SECT. II.,mingled and combined with ideas of human manufacture. There is scarcely
2281,SECT. II.,any element of the old revelation that is presented to our view under
2282,SECT. II.,"unaltered conditions: scarcely any personage of the divine order, as"
2283,SECT. II.,"represented by the Poet, stands in the same relation of resemblance"
2284,SECT. II.,"to those primeval traditions, which are to be traced in his figure"
2285,SECT. II.,and attributes. The ancient truths are not merely imperfect; they
2286,SECT. II.,"are dislocated, and, with heavy waste of material in the process,"
2287,SECT. II.,afterwards recast.
2288,SECT. II.,
2289,SECT. II.,"On account of this bewildering diversity, it will, I conceive, be most"
2290,SECT. II.,conducive to my purpose if I commence the inquiry with those deities in
2291,SECT. II.,whom the propositions I maintain are best represented: for the present
2292,SECT. II.,"putting aside others, in whom the representation of tradition, either"
2293,SECT. II.,"from the overpowering presence of other elements, or from the general"
2294,SECT. II.,"insignificance of the character, is less effective."
2295,SECT. II.,
2296,SECT. II.,"I have spoken, thus far, of the ancient traditions, as they are"
2297,SECT. II.,delivered either in the ancient or in the more recent books of the
2298,SECT. II.,"Bible. And I hope it will not be thought to savour of mere paradox,"
2299,SECT. II.,if the result of my search into the text of Homer shall be to exhibit
2300,SECT. II.,"the religion of the Greeks, in the heroic age, as possessed of more"
2301,SECT. II.,"resemblances to a primitive revelation, than those religions of the"
2302,SECT. II.,"East from which they must have borrowed largely, and which we presume"
2303,SECT. II.,to have stood between them and the fountain-head.
2304,SECT. II.,
2305,SECT. II.,"We have doubtless to consider the Greeks, as to their religion, in"
2306,SECT. II.,"three capacities: first, as receivers of the remains of pristine"
2307,SECT. II.,"tradition; secondly, as having imported, along with it, from abroad"
2308,SECT. II.,"the depraved forms of human fable; thirdly, as themselves powerful"
2309,SECT. II.,"inventors, working upon and adding to both descriptions of material."
2310,SECT. II.,"But, before we conclude that the religion of Homer must needs be"
2311,SECT. II.,"farther from that of the patriarchs than the religions, as we now read"
2312,SECT. II.,"them, of Persia, Assyria, or Egypt, we ought to be assured that the"
2313,SECT. II.,"editions, so to speak, in which we study those religions, are older"
2314,SECT. II.,"than the Homeric poems. Whereas, with respect to the great bulk of the"
2315,SECT. II.,"records at our command, this, I apprehend, is the very reverse of the"
2316,SECT. II.,truth.
2317,SECT. II.,
2318,SECT. II.,~_Messianic traditions of the Hebrews._~
2319,SECT. II.,
2320,SECT. II.,"There is, however, one source to which we may legitimately repair, as"
2321,SECT. II.,next in authority to the Holy Scriptures themselves with respect to the
2322,SECT. II.,forms of primitive tradition: I mean the earliest and most authentic
2323,SECT. II.,sacred literature of the Hebrews. Not that in kind it can resemble
2324,SECT. II.,the sacred records; but that it is at least likely to indicate what
2325,SECT. II.,"were the earliest forms of development, and the initial tendencies to"
2326,SECT. II.,deviation.
2327,SECT. II.,
2328,SECT. II.,"Since that nation became unhappily committed, through its chief"
2329,SECT. II.,"traditional authorities, to the repudiation of the Redeemer, a sinister"
2330,SECT. II.,"bias has operated upon its retrospective, as well as upon its present"
2331,SECT. II.,and prospective theology. There are nevertheless three depositaries
2332,SECT. II.,"of knowledge from which we may hope to learn what were the views,"
2333,SECT. II.,"entertained by the ancient Hebrews themselves, with regard to the"
2334,SECT. II.,all-absorbing subject of the Messianic traditions.
2335,SECT. II.,
2336,SECT. II.,"In the first place it would appear, from the very nature of the"
2337,SECT. II.,"prophecies of the Old Testament, that there must, in all likelihood,"
2338,SECT. II.,have existed along with them a system of authoritative contemporary
2339,SECT. II.,"exposition, in order that holy men might be enabled to derive from them"
2340,SECT. II.,"the consolation and instruction which, apart from their other purposes,"
2341,SECT. II.,they were divinely intended to convey. The highly figurative character
2342,SECT. II.,"and frequent obscurity of their language supports, if it does not"
2343,SECT. II.,"require, this belief: and the constant practice, attested by the later"
2344,SECT. II.,"Scriptures, of public explanation of the sacred Books, including the"
2345,SECT. II.,"Prophets, in the synagogues of the Jews, brings it as near as such a"
2346,SECT. II.,case admits to demonstration.
2347,SECT. II.,
2348,SECT. II.,"These expositions of the Sacred Text began, as it appears, to be"
2349,SECT. II.,committed to writing about the time of the Babylonish captivity;
2350,SECT. II.,"when the Chaldee tongue became the vernacular, and the old Hebrew"
2351,SECT. II.,disappeared from common use. They were collected in the Paraphrases
2352,SECT. II.,"or _Targumim_: and the fragments of the oldest of them, which had"
2353,SECT. II.,"consisted of marginal notes, were consolidated into a continuous Targum"
2354,SECT. II.,"by Onkelos, Jonathan, and others[46]."

2358,SECT. II.,
2359,SECT. II.,"Apart from the Targumim, the sacred literature of the Jews appears,"
2360,SECT. II.,"from the time of the captivity onwards, to have run in two main"
2361,SECT. II.,channels. One class of teachers and writers rested chiefly on the dry
2362,SECT. II.,"traditionary system condemned by our Saviour in the Gospels, and gave"
2363,SECT. II.,"less and less heed, as time went on, to the doctrine of Scripture, and"
2364,SECT. II.,"of their forefathers, concerning the Messiah. In the second century"
2365,SECT. II.,"after Christ, this traditionary system was reduced by the Rabbi Jehuda"
2366,SECT. II.,"into a volume called the Mischna. And in the sixth or seventh, there"
2367,SECT. II.,"was composed a larger work, the Gemara or Talmud, which purported"
2368,SECT. II.,"in part to comment on the Mischna, and which also presented a more"
2369,SECT. II.,extensive and more promiscuous collection of Rabbinical traditions. In
2370,SECT. II.,"the midst of the ordure of this work, says Schöttgen, are to be found"
2371,SECT. II.,here and there certain pearls[47].
2372,SECT. II.,
2373,SECT. II.,"[47] Schöttgen Præf. 17. B. I. c. iii. 7, 8. and Rabbin. Lect. B. I. c."
2374,SECT. II.,5.
2375,SECT. II.,
2376,SECT. II.,"Parallel with this stream of chiefly spurious learning, there was a"
2377,SECT. II.,"succession of pious writers, who both searched the Scriptures, and"
2378,SECT. II.,studied to maintain and propagate the Messianic interpretations of
2379,SECT. II.,them. Of this succession the Rabbi Simeon Ben Jochai was the great
2380,SECT. II.,"ornament; and by his disciples was compiled, some sixty years after"
2381,SECT. II.,"his death, or about A. D. 170, the work termed the Sohar, which is so"
2382,SECT. II.,"Christian in its sense, as to have convinced Schöttgen that Simeon"
2383,SECT. II.,"was himself a Christian; although, perhaps from not being understood,"
2384,SECT. II.,he was not repudiated by the Jews[48]. Upon this work was founded the
2385,SECT. II.,Cabbalistic or mystical learning.
2386,SECT. II.,
2387,SECT. II.,"[48] Schöttgen Præf. 12-15. B. I. and II. c. ii. c. iii. 6, 7. Rabb."
2388,SECT. II.,Lect. I. c. vi.
2389,SECT. II.,
2390,SECT. II.,From these sources may be derived many Messianic ideas and
2391,SECT. II.,interpretations that were current among the ancient Jews.
2392,SECT. II.,
2393,SECT. II.,"Of them I proceed to extract some, from the work of Schöttgen, which"
2394,SECT. II.,may throw light upon the interior system of the Homeric mythology in
2395,SECT. II.,its most important aspects.
2396,SECT. II.,
2397,SECT. II.,"1. First and foremost, these traditions appear to bear witness to the"
2398,SECT. II.,"extraordinary elevation of the Messiah, and they fully recognise his"
2399,SECT. II.,title to the great Tetragrammaton[49].
2400,SECT. II.,
2401,SECT. II.,"[49] Schöttgen, I. i. 1."
2402,SECT. II.,
2403,SECT. II.,"2. Next, that introduction of the female principle into the sphere"
2404,SECT. II.,"of deity, which the Greeks seem to have adopted, after their"
2405,SECT. II.,"anthropophuistic manner, with a view to the family order among the"
2406,SECT. II.,"Immortals rather than as a mere metaphysical conception, appears to"
2407,SECT. II.,have its prototype in the Hebrew traditions.
2408,SECT. II.,
2409,SECT. II.,"When in the Holy Scriptures we find wisdom personified in the feminine,"
2410,SECT. II.,"we regard this only as a mode of speech, though as one evidently"
2411,SECT. II.,tending to account for the sex of Minerva. But the Jewish traditions
2412,SECT. II.,went far beyond this[50]. The two natures of our Lord would appear
2413,SECT. II.,from the Sohar to have been distinguished under the figure of mother
2414,SECT. II.,"and daughter. The Schechina, or ‘glory of God,’ is of the feminine"
2415,SECT. II.,gender: and the relation of His divinity to His humanity is set forth
2416,SECT. II.,under the figure of a marriage. He is therefore called mother and
2417,SECT. II.,"matron; _temporibus futuris omnes hostes tradentur in manus Matronæ_,"
2418,SECT. II.,as Schöttgen renders the Sohar[51].
2419,SECT. II.,
2420,SECT. II.,"[50] Schöttgen, I. i. 3."
2421,SECT. II.,
2422,SECT. II.,"[51] Ibid. I. i. 12, 18."
2423,SECT. II.,
2424,SECT. II.,"The Λόγος, or Word of the Lord, is also shown to have been, according"
2425,SECT. II.,"to the genuine traditions of the Jews, a common expression for the"
2426,SECT. II.,Messiah. The relation thus exhibited is in marked analogy with that
2427,SECT. II.,between Minerva and Jupiter. This expression of the Targums of Jonathan
2428,SECT. II.,"and Onkelos is also in correspondence with the language of Philo, De"
2429,SECT. II.,"Confusione Linguarum, pp. 255, 267[52]."
2430,SECT. II.,
2431,SECT. II.,[52] Ibid. I. i. 2.
2432,SECT. II.,
2433,SECT. II.,4. The ideas of sonship and primogeniture[53] are likewise recognised
2434,SECT. II.,"among the titles of the Messiah, according to the Sohar and other"
2435,SECT. II.,Jewish authorities. We shall have to inquire what Homeric deities there
2436,SECT. II.,"are, who, by the distinction between their mode and time of birth, and"
2437,SECT. II.,"that of others, may appear to represent these characteristics."
2438,SECT. II.,
2439,SECT. II.,"[53] Ib. I. i. 5, 9."
2440,SECT. II.,
2441,SECT. II.,"5. The Lord of Hosts, or Zebaoth[54], is another title of the Messiah:"
2442,SECT. II.,"and we may therefore expect, in any traditionary remnant found"
2443,SECT. II.,"elsewhere, to discover some strong and commanding martial development."
2444,SECT. II.,
2445,SECT. II.,[54] Ib. I. i. 6.
2446,SECT. II.,
2447,SECT. II.,6. The Messiah was preeminently conceived of by the Jews as being the
2448,SECT. II.,Light[55]. This property is in immediate connection with the idea of
2449,SECT. II.,"the Λόγος. It cannot fail to be observed, how vividly such an idea"
2450,SECT. II.,"is represented in the ancient name Φοῖβος attaching to Apollo, and"
2451,SECT. II.,probably also in that of Λυκηγένης or ‘light-born.’ The same idea
2452,SECT. II.,"appears in the characteristic epithet Γλαυκῶπις, as it is now rightly"
2453,SECT. II.,"interpreted, for Minerva. This indeed is not merely an epithet, but it"
2454,SECT. II.,forms one of her titles: as in Il. viii. 406.
2455,SECT. II.,
2456,SECT. II.,"[55] Ibid. II. Loc. Gen. xiii. xciv. _et alibi_, and I. iii. 10, 23."
2457,SECT. II.,
2458,SECT. II.,"7. Again, the name Metatron[56] is one of those properly applied to"
2459,SECT. II.,the Messiah by the Jews. It is supposed to have denoted originally the
2460,SECT. II.,"sense of the Latin word _metator_, as having reference to the guiding"
2461,SECT. II.,"of the Israelites through the desert, and the marking or measuring out"
2462,SECT. II.,of their camps there. But it appears to have acquired afterwards the
2463,SECT. II.,"sense of Mediator, as implying that the Messiah was the organ, through"
2464,SECT. II.,whom the counsels of the Most High God took effect upon man.
2465,SECT. II.,
2466,SECT. II.,"[56] Schöttgen, I. i. 30."
2467,SECT. II.,
2468,SECT. II.,8. The performance of miracles was to be a peculiar mark of the
2469,SECT. II.,Messiah[57].
2470,SECT. II.,
2471,SECT. II.,[57] Ibid. III. Thes. iii. 2.
2472,SECT. II.,
2473,SECT. II.,"9. Another was the conquest he was to achieve over Satan, and the"
2474,SECT. II.,liberation of the dead from the grave and from the power of hell[58].
2475,SECT. II.,
2476,SECT. II.,[58] Ibid. III. Thes. ii.
2477,SECT. II.,
2478,SECT. II.,With these great gifts and powers was associated an assemblage of the
2479,SECT. II.,most winning and endearing moral qualities. ‘The Schechina (or Messiah)
2480,SECT. II.,"is the image of God; as He is gentle, so is She: as He is gracious, so"
2481,SECT. II.,"is She: as He is mighty, so is She mistress over all nations: He is"
2482,SECT. II.,"truth, She is faith: He the prophet, She the prophetess: He the just,"
2483,SECT. II.,"She the just: He the king, She the queen: He wise, She wisdom: He"
2484,SECT. II.,"intelligent, She His intelligence: He the crown, She the diadem[59].’"
2485,SECT. II.,
2486,SECT. II.,"[59] From the translation of the Sohar by Sommer, in Schöttgen, III."
2487,SECT. II.,iii.
2488,SECT. II.,
2489,SECT. II.,"The central idea of these old traditions, as we conceive it, and as it"
2490,SECT. II.,"stands apart from simple theism, was that of redemption by means of a"
2491,SECT. II.,"person clothed in the attributions of humanity, but also invested with"
2492,SECT. II.,"the nature and powers of Godhead. Of these two sides of the tradition,"
2493,SECT. II.,"one was exhibited in the Word or Wisdom of God, and the other in the"
2494,SECT. II.,"Seed of the woman. The first is appropriated to Minerva, and the second"
2495,SECT. II.,in the main to Apollo. But as the divine and human could not in the
2496,SECT. II.,"tradition long continue completely harmonized and united, so neither"
2497,SECT. II.,are they wholly severed. The Wisdom assumes a human configuration: the
2498,SECT. II.,Seed of the woman does not cease to be divine. Now Pallas and Apollo
2499,SECT. II.,"preserve, relatively to one another, the place of their prototypes in"
2500,SECT. II.,these two cardinal respects. As the tradition of the Λόγος was more
2501,SECT. II.,"immediately divine, so Pallas is more copiously invested with the"
2502,SECT. II.,"higher powers, prerogatives, and offices of deity. On the other hand,"
2503,SECT. II.,as the deliverance was to be wrought out by the immediate agency of the
2504,SECT. II.,"Seed of the woman, so Apollo is more human, and is invested with the"
2505,SECT. II.,"larger and more varied assemblage of active endowments, appertaining to"
2506,SECT. II.,"the health, welfare, safety, purification, and chastisement of mankind."
2507,SECT. II.,And one main reason of the anthropomorphous character of the Greek
2508,SECT. II.,"mythology as a whole may very probably be found in the fact, that it"
2509,SECT. II.,was an old and a pure tradition which first gave to men the idea of God
2510,SECT. II.,"in human form; the idea which, when once more purified, became that of"
2511,SECT. II.,"Emmanuel, God with us[60]."
2512,SECT. II.,
2513,SECT. II.,[60] Matt. i. 23.
2514,SECT. II.,
2515,SECT. II.,The personages of the Homeric Theo-mythology who might most reasonably
2516,SECT. II.,be distinguished as having their basis in tradition are:
2517,SECT. II.,
2518,SECT. II.,1. Jupiter.
2519,SECT. II.,2. Minerva.
2520,SECT. II.,3. Apollo.
2521,SECT. II.,4. Diana.
2522,SECT. II.,5. Latona.
2523,SECT. II.,6. Iris.
2524,SECT. II.,7. The Titans and kindred traditions.
2525,SECT. II.,"8. Ἄτη, the Temptress."
2526,SECT. II.,
2527,SECT. II.,"Of these, Jupiter is so mixed a conception, and has such important"
2528,SECT. II.,"relations to the whole genesis of the Greek mythology, that I place"
2529,SECT. II.,"him in another class, and postpone the attempt to give a view of his"
2530,SECT. II.,"person and offices until we have gone through the deities, in whom the"
2531,SECT. II.,traditional element is less disguised and also less contaminated.
2532,SECT. II.,
2533,SECT. II.,~_Minerva and Apollo the key._~
2534,SECT. II.,
2535,SECT. II.,"And of these I commence with Minerva and Apollo, not only because they"
2536,SECT. II.,"are the most dignified, but also as they are the most characteristic"
2537,SECT. II.,"representatives of the class, and because it is in their persons that"
2538,SECT. II.,we may best test the amount and quality of the evidence in support of
2539,SECT. II.,"the assertion, that a traditional basis for the religion of the heroic"
2540,SECT. II.,age of Greece is still traceable in the poems of Homer.
2541,SECT. II.,
2542,SECT. II.,Again: it is the effect of this evidence in general both to separate
2543,SECT. II.,Minerva and Apollo by many important differences from the general mass
2544,SECT. II.,"of the Olympian deities, and likewise to associate them together in a"
2545,SECT. II.,great number of common signs and properties.
2546,SECT. II.,
2547,SECT. II.,For these reasons I shall begin by considering them jointly: and I
2548,SECT. II.,believe that in a just comprehension of their position lies the key to
2549,SECT. II.,the whole Homeric system.
2550,SECT. II.,
2551,SECT. II.,"The lines of description for these two deities will, however, cross and"
2552,SECT. II.,recross one another. Their strong and pervading essential resemblances
2553,SECT. II.,do not preclude much diversity of detail; and it will not unfrequently
2554,SECT. II.,"be found to happen, either that a given sign, perhaps even one of"
2555,SECT. II.,"peculiar elevation, and thus of traditive origin, is found in one of"
2556,SECT. II.,"the two and not in the other, or else that such a sign is developed"
2557,SECT. II.,"more fully in one than in the other, or that the properties of an idea"
2558,SECT. II.,"are divided between them, as if it was felt that, where the one was,"
2559,SECT. II.,the other must in greater or less measure be.
2560,SECT. II.,
2561,SECT. II.,"It will also be remembered that I do not aim at including, even in this"
2562,SECT. II.,"detailed discussion, all that is ascribed by Homer to his Apollo and"
2563,SECT. II.,"his Minerva; but only at exhibiting, with such fulness and clearness as"
2564,SECT. II.,"I can, the distinctive character which on the whole they may be said"
2565,SECT. II.,"to possess in common, and which I believe to constitute both the most"
2566,SECT. II.,"curious, and by far the most important feature of the whole Homeric"
2567,SECT. II.,Theo-mythology.
2568,SECT. II.,
2569,SECT. II.,"The signs which appear to mark these great deities of tradition, and"
2570,SECT. II.,"which accompany them with a deliberate consistency through the poems,"
2571,SECT. II.,present themselves with various bearings. Some affect their position in
2572,SECT. II.,"the Olympian system, others their individual characters; and lastly, a"
2573,SECT. II.,"third class appertain to their dealings with man, and to their place"
2574,SECT. II.,and power in regard to the sphere of nature both animal and inanimate.
2575,SECT. II.,"Or more briefly, we may regard them in their Olympian relations, their"
2576,SECT. II.,"personal characters, and their terrestrial aspects. We will begin with"
2577,SECT. II.,the first of these three divisions.
2578,SECT. II.,
2579,SECT. II.,~_Their rank in the Olympian system._~
2580,SECT. II.,
2581,SECT. II.,"1. Their position in the Olympian system, if we are to adopt the common"
2582,SECT. II.,"genesis of the Olympian system, is one of hopeless and unaccountable"
2583,SECT. II.,solecism.
2584,SECT. II.,
2585,SECT. II.,The gods of Olympus are arranged generally in two generations. If we
2586,SECT. II.,"put Apollo and Minerva out of view, then, with the exception of a deity"
2587,SECT. II.,"like Dione, introduced to serve as a mere vehicle of maternity, and"
2588,SECT. II.,"inferior in weight, if not in rank, to her own offspring, the majesty"
2589,SECT. II.,"and might of Olympus, following the order of nature, are entirely in"
2590,SECT. II.,"the elder of these generations, and reside with Jupiter, Juno, Neptune,"
2591,SECT. II.,and Aidoneus or Pluto. The greater spheres have been shared among
2592,SECT. II.,"these divinities; nothing, except what is secondary, remains for the"
2593,SECT. II.,rest. But the position of Apollo and Minerva is in no respect inferior
2594,SECT. II.,"to those of the elder gods, save Jupiter alone: in many points it is"
2595,SECT. II.,"higher; it has approximations to the very summit, which they have"
2596,SECT. II.,"not; nay, in particular points, Jupiter himself is exceeded. It is so"
2597,SECT. II.,entirely different as a whole from that of the other deities of the
2598,SECT. II.,"second generation, that we must seek out a cause for the difference."
2599,SECT. II.,"Now it cannot be made to depend, at least in the case of Apollo, on the"
2600,SECT. II.,"paramount magnitude of any one of his functions, such as the bow, the"
2601,SECT. II.,"lyre, or even the gift of divination. It would have been natural to"
2602,SECT. II.,"anticipate that war, which is the business of Mars, might have made a"
2603,SECT. II.,"greater deity than divination, had both started from the same point. In"
2604,SECT. II.,"later times, perhaps, it did so; but in Homer the inferiority of Mars"
2605,SECT. II.,is immeasurable. Now if we cannot account for this and other cases of
2606,SECT. II.,"inferiority to Apollo in the heroic age by function, we must, I think,"
2607,SECT. II.,of necessity look for it in difference of origin.
2608,SECT. II.,
2609,SECT. II.,2. Although the relation of Apollo and Minerva to Jupiter places them
2610,SECT. II.,"in the generation next to his, (all the Homeric divinities alike are"
2611,SECT. II.,"subject to the condition of being conceived to have a beginning,) yet"
2612,SECT. II.,"there are marked differences in antiquity between these two, and all"
2613,SECT. II.,"the other deities who, like them, stand as children to Jupiter: while"
2614,SECT. II.,"the simple fact, that they stand as his children, is precisely what the"
2615,SECT. II.,"ancient traditions would have led us to expect, with a difference which"
2616,SECT. II.,we find represented in the respective modes of their derivation from
2617,SECT. II.,him.
2618,SECT. II.,
2619,SECT. II.,"Of the other deities of the same generation, there are some so recent,"
2620,SECT. II.,"as Greek deities, that their childhood is made matter of record: there"
2621,SECT. II.,is not one who bears any mark that will throw him back to the period
2622,SECT. II.,"when the Pelasgians ruled in Greece, like Jupiter as the father of the"
2623,SECT. II.,"old Hellic houses and the Dodonæan worship, or Neptune as the parent"
2624,SECT. II.,of Neleus and of Actor; or indeed that in any manner suggests great
2625,SECT. II.,antiquity. But now let us look at Minerva and Apollo. That Minerva was
2626,SECT. II.,"born from the head of Jupiter, is a legend which I apprehend signifies"
2627,SECT. II.,"that, in the oldest mythology, she had no mother: that, even if not in"
2628,SECT. II.,"the Olympian order, yet in the history of her worship she was prior"
2629,SECT. II.,"to Juno. She would otherwise have been the daughter of Juno, or of"
2630,SECT. II.,"some other mother; and the sole parentage of Jupiter is a proof, that"
2631,SECT. II.,the tradition she represented was in vogue before motherhood among
2632,SECT. II.,"the Immortals was invented. So strictly is this true, that, as the"
2633,SECT. II.,"constructive process went on, a mother was found for Minerva under"
2634,SECT. II.,the name of Metis[61]; who was at the same time placed as the oldest
2635,SECT. II.,"among the wives of Jupiter. In Homer, whether Tritogeneia is to be"
2636,SECT. II.,"interpreted head-born[62] or not, it is indubitable that Minerva has no"
2637,SECT. II.,"mother named, and is not the child of any known female divinity: and"
2638,SECT. II.,the sole parentage of Jupiter appears to be declared with sufficient
2639,SECT. II.,clearness in the expostulation of Mars to Jupiter[63];
2640,SECT. II.,
2641,SECT. II.,"[61] See Hes. Theog. 886-900. Apollod. i. 3, 6."

2648,SECT. II.,
2649,SECT. II.,"This is the only sense, so far as I can see, that can properly be given"
2650,SECT. II.,to the word αὐτός.
2651,SECT. II.,
2652,SECT. II.,"Apollo, on the other hand, is the son of Λήτω or Latona. For her name"
2653,SECT. II.,"there appears to be but one satisfactory meaning, and it is this; that"
2654,SECT. II.,"her origin was before the memory of man, that is, before the period"
2655,SECT. II.,within which the Greek mythological system had been constructed.
2656,SECT. II.,
2657,SECT. II.,"It cannot fail to be remarked, that the relation between the mythical"
2658,SECT. II.,origin of Apollo and that of Minerva exhibit a difference entirely
2659,SECT. II.,analogous to that found in the traditions which they represent
2660,SECT. II.,"respectively; and which would give to Apollo a mother, but to Minerva"
2661,SECT. II.,"none. In both, however, we may here trace a strong resemblance to the"
2662,SECT. II.,Messianic traditions of Holy Scripture and of the Jews.
2663,SECT. II.,
2664,SECT. II.,"3. These deities have a great variety of functions, of which the"
2665,SECT. II.,"secondary forms, or the executive applications, are delegated to"
2666,SECT. II.,"others, of less power and pre-eminence, but still also in most cases"
2667,SECT. II.,strictly Olympian gods. These satellite-divinities it may be convenient
2668,SECT. II.,to designate by the name of Secondaries.

2673,SECT. II.,"as a class, a distinct consideration."
2674,SECT. II.,
2675,SECT. II.,They are as follows:
2676,SECT. II.,
2677,SECT. II.,"First, for Minerva, in her great characters as goddess of wisdom, of"
2678,SECT. II.,"war, of polity, and of industrial art."
2679,SECT. II.,
2680,SECT. II.,"In the first, Mercury is her Secondary: for both are presiding"
2681,SECT. II.,"divinities or patrons of that calculating faculty applied to conduct,"
2682,SECT. II.,"which, on the side of virtue, reads as prudence, and which in its"
2683,SECT. II.,degenerate form is craft (κέρδεα or κερδοσύνη).
2684,SECT. II.,
2685,SECT. II.,"In treating the god Mercury, with respect to this capital particular,"
2686,SECT. II.,"as a secondary of Minerva, I do not mean that he is nothing else:"
2687,SECT. II.,"but that the traditions about Hermes were found capable of, and were"
2688,SECT. II.,"allowed to bear, such a form, that it is impossible to describe fully"
2689,SECT. II.,the function of the one deity without including something that is also
2690,SECT. II.,"annexed to the other, or to draw any clear line between them."
2691,SECT. II.,
2692,SECT. II.,"In later times Mercury at Athens was, according to Müller[64], a"
2693,SECT. II.,"Secondary also to Apollo, charged with the exoteric and material parts"
2694,SECT. II.,"of several among his functions. And in Homer it seems probable, that"
2695,SECT. II.,his office with respect to the dead ought to be viewed as ministerial
2696,SECT. II.,to that of Apollo.
2697,SECT. II.,

2699,SECT. II.,
2700,SECT. II.,"In the next of her great offices, as goddess of war, Mars is a"
2701,SECT. II.,Secondary to Minerva; and he is absolutely nothing more. It may be
2702,SECT. II.,enough in this place to refer to what will be said of him in the next
2703,SECT. II.,Section.
2704,SECT. II.,
2705,SECT. II.,"The Minerva of polity, the λαοσσόος, ἀγελείη, and ἐρυσιπτόλις, is"
2706,SECT. II.,represented by Themis as a Secondary: whose name betokens her character
2707,SECT. II.,"as a simple personification of the idea of political and social rights,"
2708,SECT. II.,reflected from earth upon the Olympian life.
2709,SECT. II.,
2710,SECT. II.,"In the last of the four functions, Vulcan is her Secondary. It is"
2711,SECT. II.,"true that the traditions do not exactly square. He is something more,"
2712,SECT. II.,"because he is the element of fire, as well as the workman who operates"
2713,SECT. II.,"by it: and he is also something less, because he has no concern with"
2714,SECT. II.,"tissues, which fire has no share in creating, and which in Greece,"
2715,SECT. II.,"but not in Egypt[65], were exclusively the business of women. But the"
2716,SECT. II.,relation between the two is indisputable: nor is it less plain that
2717,SECT. II.,"in that relation he fills, taken generally, the place of Olympian"
2718,SECT. II.,"workman, she of a presiding mind operating upon man. And again, she is"
2719,SECT. II.,the goddess of construction; he has relations only with one particular
2720,SECT. II.,department of it.

2730,SECT. II.,"Paieon; who disappears from the later and less refined Greek mythology,"
2731,SECT. II.,"and is replaced by an Æsculapius, reflected from the purely human"
2732,SECT. II.,"Asclepius of Homer. Paieon is a simply executive officer, and exercises"
2733,SECT. II.,"his gift, or as we should now say practises, exclusively, as does"
2734,SECT. II.,"Vulcan, except on special occasions, for the benefit of the Olympian"
2735,SECT. II.,"community; while the original possession of the gift, and the power of"
2736,SECT. II.,"distributing it, is with Apollo."
2737,SECT. II.,
2738,SECT. II.,There is a further and more subtle relation between this deity and
2739,SECT. II.,"Apollo, indicated by the use of the name παιήων for the hymn of"
2740,SECT. II.,"victory[66]. Whatever be the ground of this usage, it supplies another"
2741,SECT. II.,"point, in which Paieon reflects Apollo the god of help, and so far"
2742,SECT. II.,tends to exhibit Apollo as also the god of victory. Paieon heals by the
2743,SECT. II.,"use of his hands, like an ordinary surgeon; Apollo without personal"
2744,SECT. II.,"presence, and without the use of second causes, in answer to prayer[67]."

2753,SECT. II.,"Their relation to him, and the combination in themselves of the plural"
2754,SECT. II.,"with the singular, are very curious. His immediate concern is with"
2755,SECT. II.,"the lyre, theirs with the voice. They sometimes appear as one; for"
2756,SECT. II.,"instance, in the first verse of each of the poems: sometimes as many;"
2757,SECT. II.,"for instance, in the invocation before the Catalogue. Even their action"
2758,SECT. II.,"is so combined, that what at one time they do as one, at others they do"
2759,SECT. II.,"as many. It is the Muses who maim Thamyris: it is the Muse, who greatly"
2760,SECT. II.,"loves Demodocus, who lays upon him the burden of blindness, but endows"

2767,SECT. II.,with them as to many distinct impersonations: or at least we must not
2768,SECT. II.,follow out that idea to its consequences. And for this reason; they
2769,SECT. II.,"were not in contact with the popular mind, and formed no part of the"
2770,SECT. II.,"public religion: they were formations of the Poet for his own purposes,"
2771,SECT. II.,"whom he might make and unmake at his will, and the conditions of whose"
2772,SECT. II.,"existence he might modify, without being bound to any further degree"
2773,SECT. II.,of consistency than might for the occasion answer the purpose of his
2774,SECT. II.,"art. We must not, then, ask him whether he really means his Muse to be"
2775,SECT. II.,"one or many, and if many, how many (it is, indeed, only in the second"
2776,SECT. II.,"νεκυΐα that he mentions them as nine[69]), but must simply take them as"

2780,SECT. II.,
2781,SECT. II.,"And here we at once perceive both the ground of their plurality, and"
2782,SECT. II.,"their ministerial relation to Apollo. The former, probably, lay in the"
2783,SECT. II.,"nature of harmony, or simultaneous combination of tones, requiring,"
2784,SECT. II.,"of course, a combination of different voices, to effect what on the"
2785,SECT. II.,"instrument is done by different strings. And if it did not spring from,"
2786,SECT. II.,"it was at least suited to, that succession of alternate parts, which"
2787,SECT. II.,"was, as we know, used in Israel even more anciently than in Homer’s"
2788,SECT. II.,"time, and which may, though I do not, for one, feel certain that it"
2789,SECT. II.,"must, have been signified by the term ἀμειβόμεναι, a name clearly"
2790,SECT. II.,relating to part-singing in one sense or another. Their subordinate
2791,SECT. II.,relation to Apollo is represented in the combination[70] of the voice
2792,SECT. II.,"with the instrument. He, as the Original, remains in possession of"
2793,SECT. II.,the indivisible gift: they assist him in one which is essentially
2794,SECT. II.,"distributive. And as they share in his music, so also in his knowledge:"
2795,SECT. II.,but only in that which relates to the past: with the future they have
2796,SECT. II.,"no concern[71]. But as either Minerva or Vulcan can teach a smith, so"

2806,SECT. II.,
2807,SECT. II.,"Such then are the Olympian Secondaries. None of them, it will be"
2808,SECT. II.,"observed, are properly derivative beings. All of them represent, in"
2809,SECT. II.,"some sense, traditions, or imaginations, distinct from those respecting"
2810,SECT. II.,their principal deity: nor are they in the same kind of subservience to
2811,SECT. II.,"them as the Eilithuiæ to Juno, who have no worship paid them, and are"
2812,SECT. II.,of doubtful personality; or as the metal handmaids to Vulcan himself.
2813,SECT. II.,"But they are deities, each of whom singly in a particular province"
2814,SECT. II.,"administers a function, which also belongs to a deity of higher"
2815,SECT. II.,dignity. And though a difference is clearly discernible in the form of
2816,SECT. II.,"the possession and administration, yet there still remains a clear and"
2817,SECT. II.,"manifest duplication, a lapping over of divinities, which is entirely"
2818,SECT. II.,at variance with the symmetry that we might reckon upon finding in an
2819,SECT. II.,homogeneous conception of the Greeks.
2820,SECT. II.,
2821,SECT. II.,"This irregular duplication is kept in some degree out of view, if"
2822,SECT. II.,we set out with the determination to refer the Homeric deities to a
2823,SECT. II.,"single origin, to make a regular division of duties among them, and to"
2824,SECT. II.,"pare down this, or enlarge that, till we have brought them and their"
2825,SECT. II.,"supposed gifts into the requisite order. But as it stands in Homer,"
2826,SECT. II.,"free from later admixtures, and from prepossessions of ours, it is"
2827,SECT. II.,"a most curious and significant fact, and raises at once a serious"
2828,SECT. II.,inquiry as to its cause.
2829,SECT. II.,
2830,SECT. II.,I submit that it may be referred to the joint operation of two
2831,SECT. II.,"circumstances. First, to the particular form of the early traditions"
2832,SECT. II.,"that were incorporated into the invented or Olympian system. Secondly,"
2833,SECT. II.,"to the principle of economy, or family and social order, reflected back"
2834,SECT. II.,from the human community upon the divine.
2835,SECT. II.,
2836,SECT. II.,"If the primitive tradition, even when disfigured by the lapse of"
2837,SECT. II.,"time, yet on its arrival in Greece still visibly appropriated to one"
2838,SECT. II.,"sublime person, distinguishable from the supreme God, and femininely"
2839,SECT. II.,"conceived, the attributes of sovereign wisdom, strength, and skill;"
2840,SECT. II.,"and to another, in the form of man, the gifts of knowledge, reaching"
2841,SECT. II.,"before and after, and identified in early times with that of Song, as"
2842,SECT. II.,well as that of healing or deliverance from pain and death; then we
2843,SECT. II.,"can understand why it is that, when these great personages take their"
2844,SECT. II.,"places as of right in the popular mythology, they continue to keep hold"
2845,SECT. II.,"on certain great functions, in which their attributes are primarily"
2846,SECT. II.,developed.
2847,SECT. II.,
2848,SECT. II.,~_Picture of human society in Olympus._~
2849,SECT. II.,
2850,SECT. II.,"But on the other hand, the divine society must be cast into the form of"
2851,SECT. II.,the human; and this especially must take effect in three great organic
2852,SECT. II.,"particulars. First, by means of the family, which brings the members"
2853,SECT. II.,"of the body into being: secondly, by political association, involving"
2854,SECT. II.,"the necessity of a head, and of a deliberative organ: thirdly, by the"
2855,SECT. II.,"existence of certain professions, which by the use of intellectual"
2856,SECT. II.,gifts provide for the exigencies of the community. The merely labouring
2857,SECT. II.,"classes, in whose place and idea there is nothing of the governing"
2858,SECT. II.,"function, are naturally without representation, in the configuration of"
2859,SECT. II.,"the divine community, as to the forms of their particular employments:"
2860,SECT. II.,though the people at large bear a rude analogy to the mass of inferior
2861,SECT. II.,"deities not included in the ordinary meeting of the gods, yet summoned"
2862,SECT. II.,"to the great Chapter or Parliament. Olympus must, in short, have its"
2863,SECT. II.,δημιόεργοι.

2873,SECT. II.,
2874,SECT. II.,"Here, indeed, there is no representation of the principle of gain"
2875,SECT. II.,"or commerce, which does not appear as yet to have formed a class in"
2876,SECT. II.,"Greece, though the Ithacans habitually sacrificed to Mercury[74]."
2877,SECT. II.,"But that formation was on the way; for the class was already known,"
2878,SECT. II.,"doubtless as a Phœnician one, under the name of πρηκτῆρες, men of"
2879,SECT. II.,"business, apt to degenerate into τρωκταὶ, or sharpers. Nor was"
2880,SECT. II.,there a class of soldiers; but every citizen became a soldier upon
2881,SECT. II.,"occasion. With these additions, it is curious to observe how faithfully"
2882,SECT. II.,the Olympian copy is modelled upon the human original. The five
2883,SECT. II.,"professions, or demioergic functions, are,"

2892,SECT. II.,
2893,SECT. II.,Now all these were actually represented in Apollo and Minerva; the
2894,SECT. II.,"first, second, and fourth by Apollo, the third and fifth by Minerva,"
2895,SECT. II.,who was also the highest type of war. But this union of several
2896,SECT. II.,human professions in one divine person would have been fatal to
2897,SECT. II.,"the fidelity and effectiveness of the Olympian picture, to which a"
2898,SECT. II.,"division of labour, analogous to the division existing in actual"
2899,SECT. II.,"society, was essential. Therefore the accumulation was to be reduced."
2900,SECT. II.,"And in order to make this practicable, there were distinct traditions"
2901,SECT. II.,"ready, on which could be laid the superfluous or most easily separable"
2902,SECT. II.,attributes of Apollo and Minerva. So Apollo keeps unimpaired his gift
2903,SECT. II.,"of foreknowledge, and Minerva hers of sublime wisdom. With these no one"
2904,SECT. II.,is permitted to interfere. But the ἰήτηρ is represented in Paieon: the
2905,SECT. II.,"τέκτων (into Olympus however no inferior material enters, and all work"
2906,SECT. II.,"is evidently in metal, of which the celestial Smith[75] constructs the"
2907,SECT. II.,"buildings themselves, that on earth would be made of wood) is exhibited"
2908,SECT. II.,"in Vulcan: the ἀοιδὸς in the Muses, the πρήκτηρ in Mercury, and the man"
2909,SECT. II.,of war in Mars.

2915,SECT. II.,3. Though Minerva cannot contest with Juno the honour of mere
2916,SECT. II.,"precedence in the Olympian court, yet, as regards substantial dignity,"
2917,SECT. II.,"she by no means yields even to the queen of heaven. Sometimes,"
2918,SECT. II.,"undoubtedly, when she moves in the interest of the Greeks, it is upon"
2919,SECT. II.,"the suggestion of Juno made to herself, as in Il. i. 195; or through"
2920,SECT. II.,"Jupiter, as in Il. iv. 64. But it is probable that this should be"
2921,SECT. II.,"referred, not to greater eminence or authority, but simply to the more"
2922,SECT. II.,"intensely and more narrowly Hellenized character of Juno. There are, at"
2923,SECT. II.,"any rate, beyond all doubt, some arrangements adopted by the poet, with"
2924,SECT. II.,"the special intent, to all appearance, of indicating a full equality,"
2925,SECT. II.,"if not an actual pre-eminence, for Minerva. Twice the two goddesses"
2926,SECT. II.,descend together from Olympus to the field of battle. Both times it
2927,SECT. II.,"is in the chariot of Juno. Now Iris, as on one occasion, at least,"
2928,SECT. II.,"she acts at Juno’s bidding, and as on another we find her unyoking the"
2929,SECT. II.,"chariot of Mars, might with propriety have been employed to discharge"
2930,SECT. II.,this function at a moment when the two greatest goddesses are about
2931,SECT. II.,"to set out together. It is not so, however. Juno herself yokes the"
2932,SECT. II.,"horses, and also plays the part of driver, while Minerva mounts as the"
2933,SECT. II.,"warrior beside her[76]. To be the charioteer is generally, though not"
2934,SECT. II.,"quite invariably, the note of the inferior. But irrespectively of this"
2935,SECT. II.,"official distinction, Minerva with her Ægis is the conspicuous, and"
2936,SECT. II.,Juno evidently the subordinate figure in the group.

2960,SECT. II.,"Yet once more. The same train of ideas, which explains how Olympus"
2961,SECT. II.,"is fitted with a set of Secondaries, also shows to us why these"
2962,SECT. II.,Secondaries have only the lower or subsidiary form of their several
2963,SECT. II.,gifts. It is because these gifts were already in the possession
2964,SECT. II.,"of higher personages, before the introduction of the more recent"
2965,SECT. II.,"traditions represented by the Secondaries: traditions, of which the"
2966,SECT. II.,"whole, (except that of Paieon, who is not worshipped at all, and exists"
2967,SECT. II.,"only in and for Olympus,) bear upon them, as received in Greece, the"
2968,SECT. II.,"marks of modernism[78]. They naturally submit to the conditions,"
2969,SECT. II.,"anterior to themselves, of the hierarchy into which they are"
2970,SECT. II.,"introduced. But, on the one hand, their existence, together with the"
2971,SECT. II.,"peculiar relation of their work and attributes, rather than themselves,"
2972,SECT. II.,"to the great deities of tradition, Apollo and Minerva, constitutes"
2973,SECT. II.,of itself a strong argument for the separate and more ancient origin
2974,SECT. II.,"of those divinities. On the other hand, they bear powerful testimony"
2975,SECT. II.,"to the force of that principle, which reflected on the Achæan heaven"
2976,SECT. II.,the experience of earth. For there is not a single dignified and
2977,SECT. II.,"intellectual occupation known to and in use among the Hellenic tribes,"
2978,SECT. II.,"properly so called, which has not, as far as may be, counterpart on"
2979,SECT. II.,Olympus. Not even the priesthood is a real exception; especially if
2980,SECT. II.,"I am right in believing it to be Pelasgian, and not yet to have been"
2981,SECT. II.,"adopted in the time of Homer as one of the Hellenic institutions. But,"
2982,SECT. II.,"even if it had been so adopted, it could not, from the nature of the"
2983,SECT. II.,"case, have been carried into the Olympian system, since there were no"
2984,SECT. II.,"beings above themselves to whom the gods could offer sacrifice, and"
2985,SECT. II.,"since, according to the depraved idea of it which had begun to prevail,"
2986,SECT. II.,in offering it they would have parted with something that was of value
2987,SECT. II.,to themselves.

2993,SECT. II.,"conspicuous honour, that, when either of them enters the assembled"
2994,SECT. II.,"Court, all the other deities rise up[79]. It is plain that Homer"
2995,SECT. II.,included in the picture before his mental eye ideas relating to that
2996,SECT. II.,"external order which we term precedence: and it may be shown, that"
2997,SECT. II.,"Minerva had the precedence over the other gods, or what we should term"
2998,SECT. II.,"the seat of honour; that place which was occupied, in the human family,"
2999,SECT. II.,"by the eldest son. Juno we must presume, as the reflection of Jupiter,"

3044,SECT. II.,"between Jupiter and these two, as compared with his other children."

3049,SECT. II.,"note, because it might have been expected that other divinities rather"
3050,SECT. II.,"than these, for example, Mercury on account of his youth, or Venus for"
3051,SECT. II.,"her beauty and blandishments, would have been the preferable objects of"
3052,SECT. II.,"these phrases. But there is nothing of the sort in the case of Mercury,"
3053,SECT. II.,"and in that of Venus, the nearest approach is τέκνον ἐμόν (Il. v. 428)."
3054,SECT. II.,"She is only addressed as φίλον τέκος by Juno, who was not her mother,"

3064,SECT. II.,"of full obedience, but then she is strong in the self-consciousness"
3065,SECT. II.,of right as well as in power. She goes all lengths in thwarting
3066,SECT. II.,"Jupiter in the Iliad, excites his wrath, and draws down on herself"
3067,SECT. II.,his menaces[85]. But her general aim is to give effect to a design
3068,SECT. II.,"so unequivocally approved in Olympus, that Jupiter himself has been"
3069,SECT. II.,"constrained to give way to it; namely, the vindication of justice by"
3070,SECT. II.,"the fall of Troy. And consequently, upon the slightest indication from"
3071,SECT. II.,"her of a conciliatory disposition, Jupiter shows himself appeased, and"
3072,SECT. II.,seems to regret his own rigour[86].

3078,SECT. II.,The case of Apollo stands alone as an exhibition of entire harmony with
3079,SECT. II.,the will of Jupiter. On no single occasion does he act or speak in a
3080,SECT. II.,different sense from that of his parent. In the Olympian Council of the
3081,SECT. II.,"Twenty-Fourth Iliad, having to make a strong remonstrance respecting"
3082,SECT. II.,"the dishonoured condition of the body of Hector, he is careful to"
3083,SECT. II.,"address it not to Jupiter, but to the body of gods present[87];"

3088,SECT. II.,
3089,SECT. II.,"And consequently, when Juno follows with a sharp invective aimed at"
3090,SECT. II.,"him, Jupiter immediately checks her[88], and gives effect to the"
3091,SECT. II.,counsel of Apollo. Generally throughout the poem he is the organ
3092,SECT. II.,"of Jupiter for all that is about to be effected on behalf of Troy,"
3093,SECT. II.,"but never for any purpose which is to prove abortive. When, under"
3094,SECT. II.,"the divine decree, Hector is about to be slain by Achilles, Apollo"
3095,SECT. II.,"withdraws from the doomed warrior, and Minerva joins the favoured one."
3096,SECT. II.,
3097,SECT. II.,[88] Ibid. 65.
3098,SECT. II.,
3099,SECT. II.,This union of the will of Apollo with that of Jupiter must not be
3100,SECT. II.,lightly passed by. It is in truth one of the very strongest arguments
3101,SECT. II.,to show the presence of traditionary elements in this great conception.
3102,SECT. II.,"For wide as is the prevalence of the law of discord upon earth, that"
3103,SECT. II.,evil is hardly less rife in Olympus. Not only do menaces form the
3104,SECT. II.,supreme sanction by which in many cases its government is carried
3105,SECT. II.,"on, but every kind of personal grudge and quarrel abounds, as well"
3106,SECT. II.,as a general tendency to intrigue and insubordination. So that it
3107,SECT. II.,"does not sound strange to us, when Jupiter uses to his son Mars what"
3108,SECT. II.,nevertheless upon examination we must allow to be an astonishing
3109,SECT. II.,expression;
3110,SECT. II.,
3111,SECT. II.,"ἔχθιστος δέ μοί ἐσσι θεῶν, οἳ Ὄλυμπον ἔχουσιν[89]."

3117,SECT. II.,"action, either as between any one of them and Jupiter, or as among"
3118,SECT. II.,themselves. I therefore take it as a very strong indication that
3119,SECT. II.,"materials were brought for this tradition, so different in kind from"
3120,SECT. II.,"what Olympus yielded, out of a source higher than Olympus."

3132,SECT. II.,propose to scale it by piling the mountains. And this they would have
3133,SECT. II.,"accomplished, had they attained to their proper age and full size"
3134,SECT. II.,(ἥβη): but Apollo destroyed them first[90].
3135,SECT. II.,
3136,SECT. II.,[90] Od. xi. 307-20.
3137,SECT. II.,
3138,SECT. II.,This is a tradition which cannot properly belong to Greek invention:
3139,SECT. II.,"for what has Apollo to do, when so regarded, either with the wielding"
3140,SECT. II.,"of vast physical force, or with laying it prostrate? Neither as"
3141,SECT. II.,"physician, harper, poet, prophet, archer, nor angel of Death, does"
3142,SECT. II.,he appear to have been the person who would have been chosen for
3143,SECT. II.,this purpose. The thunderbolt of Jupiter is the weapon we should
3144,SECT. II.,"have expected to be employed in preference, or the mighty spear and"
3145,SECT. II.,"terrifying Ægis of Minerva, or even the brute bulk of Mars. The gentle"
3146,SECT. II.,"death, which it was Apollo’s mythological office to bring about, is"
3147,SECT. II.,totally unsuited to the subject.
3148,SECT. II.,
3149,SECT. II.,It is only when we expand that mild conception into the character
3150,SECT. II.,"of the Avenger, partially exhibited in the First Iliad, that Apollo"
3151,SECT. II.,becomes the fitting destroyer of Otus and Ephialtes. This tradition in
3152,SECT. II.,aftertimes was apparently combined with a larger one relating to the
3153,SECT. II.,"Giants, at which Homer darkly glances[91]."
3154,SECT. II.,
3155,SECT. II.,"[91] Od. vii. 56, 60."
3156,SECT. II.,
3157,SECT. II.,Ovid makes Jupiter his own defender[92]: a fine passage in Horace
3158,SECT. II.,"introduces many divine combatants, but retains a rather prominent place"
3159,SECT. II.,"for Apollo, while it gives another to Minerva; and these two with"
3160,SECT. II.,Jupiter appear to bear the brunt of the battle[93].

3165,SECT. II.,
3166,SECT. II.,"It admits of but one satisfactory explanation, namely that, coming from"
3167,SECT. II.,"a source higher than the mythology, it does not, so to speak, wear the"
3168,SECT. II.,"livery of that system: and that this performance is assigned to Apollo,"
3169,SECT. II.,either because he represented the Person to whom all power was to
3170,SECT. II.,"belong in heaven and earth both for destruction and for deliverance, or"
3171,SECT. II.,else because tradition actually assigned to that same Person the glory
3172,SECT. II.,of having already overcome a rebellion of powerful beings against the
3173,SECT. II.,Most High.
3174,SECT. II.,
3175,SECT. II.,"There is no precise parallel supplied by Homer, in the case of"
3176,SECT. II.,"Minerva, to the tradition which makes Apollo the destroyer of the"
3177,SECT. II.,"rebels. But though not the defender of the divine order at large, she"
3178,SECT. II.,"is the champion of Hercules, the favourite son of Jupiter, under"
3179,SECT. II.,"circumstances when apparently, but for her, his divinity would have"
3180,SECT. II.,"been at fault. ‘What!’ says Minerva, when thwarted by her parent in"
3181,SECT. II.,"the Eighth Iliad, ‘has he forgotten how many times I saved his son in"
3182,SECT. II.,"the labours imposed upon him by Eurystheus? Had I, at the time when"
3183,SECT. II.,"Hercules was sent by him to fetch Cerberus out of the under-world,"
3184,SECT. II.,"known how he would behave now, never should he have escaped the dread"
3185,SECT. II.,streams of Styx[94].’ We are left to infer from this curious legend
3186,SECT. II.,"that Minerva had a power, available in the world below, which tradition"
3187,SECT. II.,"did not assign to Jupiter, and that he found her use of it on this"
3188,SECT. II.,"occasion absolutely indispensable for the fulfilment of his wishes,"
3189,SECT. II.,even in regard to a favourite son.

3192,SECT. II.,
3193,SECT. II.,"Each of these functions, assigned to Apollo and Minerva respectively,"
3194,SECT. II.,"recalls to memory those Jewish traditions, which set forth the direct"
3195,SECT. II.,and especial power of the Messiah over the fallen angels and over the
3196,SECT. II.,grave.
3197,SECT. II.,
3198,SECT. II.,~_These deities are never foiled by others._~
3199,SECT. II.,
3200,SECT. II.,6. The last characteristic of the two peculiarly traditive deities
3201,SECT. II.,"which will be mentioned under this head is, that they are never foiled,"
3202,SECT. II.,"defeated, or outwitted by any other of the gods. In no single case has"
3203,SECT. II.,"Minerva, where she is in action, to encounter any one of these forms"
3204,SECT. II.,"of dishonour: nor has Apollo, in any instance except only when he is"
3205,SECT. II.,"pitted against Minerva. Of this class there are two cases: one, when"
3206,SECT. II.,"the Greeks are losing ground[95], and he is made to arrange with her"
3207,SECT. II.,"for stopping the general conflict, by prompting the personal challenge"
3208,SECT. II.,from Hector in its stead: a matter which was certain to end to the
3209,SECT. II.,"credit of the Greeks. The other is in the Doloneia[96], when he causes"
3210,SECT. II.,"an alarm just in time to find that Diomed and Ulysses, guided by"
3211,SECT. II.,"Minerva, have accomplished the bloody purpose of their errand. Among"
3212,SECT. II.,"men, as among gods, Minerva touches nothing except what is destined to"
3213,SECT. II.,"triumph. She is not, therefore, invoked by the doomed Patroclus: and"
3214,SECT. II.,she renders him no aid.

3217,SECT. II.,
3218,SECT. II.,[96] Il. x. 515.
3219,SECT. II.,
3220,SECT. II.,"To appreciate the importance of this consideration, we must bear in"
3221,SECT. II.,"mind that there is no one of the purely invented deities, who is not"
3222,SECT. II.,at one time or another subject in some form to disparagement. Mars is
3223,SECT. II.,"worsted by Minerva, through Diomed, as well as directly subject to her"
3224,SECT. II.,control; Vulcan is laughed at by the gods in general; Mercury dares not
3225,SECT. II.,encounter Latona; Ceres sees her lover slain by Jupiter; Venus is not
3226,SECT. II.,"only smitten to the ground by Minerva, but beaten by Diomed without his"
3227,SECT. II.,"having any divine aid to strengthen him, and befooled by Juno; Juno"
3228,SECT. II.,"outwits Jupiter himself; but Juno also, together with Aides, is wounded"
3229,SECT. II.,"sorely by Hercules; and it is also recorded of her, that she had been"
3230,SECT. II.,subjected by her husband to the ignominious punishment of hanging in
3231,SECT. II.,"chains, with an anvil at each foot[97]."
3232,SECT. II.,
3233,SECT. II.,[97] Il. xv. 18.
3234,SECT. II.,
3235,SECT. II.,Neptune is no where subjected to personal ignominy; but he is baffled
3236,SECT. II.,"by Laomedon, and is also unable to avenge effectually the mutilation"
3237,SECT. II.,"of his son Polyphemus. Nay, Jupiter himself, besides being deceived by"
3238,SECT. II.,"Juno, was menaced by a formidable combination, who were about to put"
3239,SECT. II.,"him in fetters, when Briareus came to his aid[98]."
3240,SECT. II.,
3241,SECT. II.,[98] Il. i. 398-406.

3243,SECT. II.,"On the other hand, Apollo arrests with sudden shock the victorious"
3244,SECT. II.,"career of Diomed[99], and again of Patroclus[100]. And in the destinies"
3245,SECT. II.,"of Ulysses, Minerva, who protects him, effectually, though after a"
3246,SECT. II.,"struggle, prevails against Neptune, who does his uttermost against him."
3247,SECT. II.,"In order, however, justly to estimate the weight of this consideration,"
3248,SECT. II.,"we must not omit to notice, that it has cost Homer an elaborate, and"
3249,SECT. II.,"what we might otherwise call a far-fetched contrivance[101], to save"
3250,SECT. II.,Apollo from dishonour in the Theomachy. He is there matched against
3251,SECT. II.,"Neptune, a deity of rank equal to that of Jupiter, and in force"
3252,SECT. II.,inferior to his elder brother alone. It was therefore inadmissible
3253,SECT. II.,that such a god should be subjected to defeat. But if Apollo were no
3254,SECT. II.,"more than one of the ordinary deities of invention, no similar reason"
3255,SECT. II.,"could apply to him. He was junior: he was a son of Jupiter, like Mars"
3256,SECT. II.,"or Mercury: he was on the losing side, that of the Trojans: why should"
3257,SECT. II.,"he not, like Mars, be well thrashed by his antagonist? It could only"
3258,SECT. II.,"be, I think, in consequence of some broad line of demarcation between"
3259,SECT. II.,them: some severance which determines their characters and positions as
3260,SECT. II.,"radically and fundamentally, and not by mere accident, divided."

3267,SECT. II.,
3268,SECT. II.,If we consider the mere birth of these two deities according to the
3269,SECT. II.,"Olympian order, every consideration derived from that source would tend"
3270,SECT. II.,to assign to Mars a higher place than Apollo. His function was more
3271,SECT. II.,"commanding: for in an age of turbulence, and among a people given alike"
3272,SECT. II.,"to freebooting and to open war, what pacific office could compete,"
3273,SECT. II.,"abstractedly, with that of the god of arms? Again, Mars is the son of"
3274,SECT. II.,"Juno, who is the eldest daughter of Saturn, the original and principal"
3275,SECT. II.,"wife of Jupiter, the acknowledged queen of Olympus: the coequal in"
3276,SECT. II.,"birth of the great trine brotherhood, and second in power to none"
3277,SECT. II.,but Jupiter himself. Why should the child of Latona be placed so far
3278,SECT. II.,"above the child of one so much his superior in birth, according to the"
3279,SECT. II.,mythological order? Why is his position so different from that enjoyed
3280,SECT. II.,"by the child of Dione, or the child of Ceres?"
3281,SECT. II.,
3282,SECT. II.,"But so studiously does Homer cherish the dignity of Apollo, that he"
3283,SECT. II.,does not even throw on him the burden of taking the initiative in
3284,SECT. II.,proposing the plan by which it is to be saved. This is managed with
3285,SECT. II.,"great care and art. ‘Let us two fight,’ says Neptune, ‘but do you"
3286,SECT. II.,"begin, as I am the older, and know better.’ And then, by bringing up"
3287,SECT. II.,"their common grudge against Laomedon, he proceeds to show of what"
3288,SECT. II.,absurdity Apollo would be guilty if he were to follow the ironical
3289,SECT. II.,"advice, and thus makes it easy, indeed inevitable, for him to echo the"
3290,SECT. II.,"sentiment, and say, let us leave them, hapless mortals, to themselves."
3291,SECT. II.,
3292,SECT. II.,With this we may compare two other arrangements conceived in the same
3293,SECT. II.,"spirit. In the Fifteenth Iliad, Jupiter takes care that the mission"
3294,SECT. II.,"of Apollo to assist the Trojans shall only begin when Neptune, the"
3295,SECT. II.,"formidable friend of the Greeks, has already quitted the field of"
3296,SECT. II.,"battle[102]. And in the Fifth Odyssey, it is contrived that only when"
3297,SECT. II.,"Neptune withdraws from the persecution of Ulysses, then at length"
3298,SECT. II.,Minerva shall instantly appear to resume her charge over him[103].

3303,SECT. II.,
3304,SECT. II.,"When we come to discuss the position of Latona, both generally and in"
3305,SECT. II.,"the Theomachy, further force will, I think, be added to the foregoing"
3306,SECT. II.,"considerations. On the other hand, I admit that the legend of Apollo"
3307,SECT. II.,"with Laomedon, which represents that he and Neptune were deceived by"
3308,SECT. II.,"that king, is not, so far as I see, explained in any manner which"
3309,SECT. II.,should place it in entire harmony with the general rule we have been
3310,SECT. II.,"considering, unless we may consider that he had his revenge in the"
3311,SECT. II.,opportunity afforded him by the Theomachy of refusing to fight for
3312,SECT. II.,"Troy. But this is a case of treatment by a mortal, not by a god; and it"
3313,SECT. II.,belongs to a different order.
3314,SECT. II.,
3315,SECT. II.,I now proceed to touch upon the pre-eminence of Minerva and Apollo in
3316,SECT. II.,"points connected with their terrestrial relations, and with what may be"
3317,SECT. II.,termed the physical conditions of their existence.
3318,SECT. II.,
3319,SECT. II.,"1. It is quite clear from Homer, that these two deities received from"
3320,SECT. II.,"men a special and peculiar honour: though it may be open to question,"
3321,SECT. II.,"whether this retained only the indeterminate form of a sentiment, or"
3322,SECT. II.,whether it was embodied in some fact or usage.
3323,SECT. II.,
3324,SECT. II.,Pallas and Apollo have the exclusive distinction of being invoked in
3325,SECT. II.,"conjunction with Jupiter, in the remarkable line"
3326,SECT. II.,
3327,SECT. II.,"Αἲ γὰρ, Ζεῦ τε πάτερ καὶ Ἀθηναίη καὶ Ἄπολλον."
3328,SECT. II.,
3329,SECT. II.,"This verse meets us, not upon occasions having reference to any"
3330,SECT. II.,"peculiar rite or function, but simply when the speaker desires to"
3331,SECT. II.,give utterance with a peculiar solemnity or emphasis to some strong
3332,SECT. II.,"and paramount desire. Thus Agamemnon wishes, with this adjuration,"
3333,SECT. II.,"that he had ten such counsellors as Nestor[104]: and again, that all"
3334,SECT. II.,his warriors had the same activity of spirit as the two Ajaxes[105].
3335,SECT. II.,Nestor with these words wishes himself young again[106]: as does old
3336,SECT. II.,"Laertes[107]. Achilles prays in this form, when exasperated, for"
3337,SECT. II.,the destruction of Greeks and Trojans alike[108]: Menelaus for the
3338,SECT. II.,appearance of Ulysses among the Suitors[109]; Alcinous thus expresses
3339,SECT. II.,the wish that Ulysses could be the husband of Nausicaa[110]: and
3340,SECT. II.,"lastly, Telemachus, that the Suitors were in a worse condition than the"
3341,SECT. II.,disabled Irus[111].

3360,SECT. II.,
3361,SECT. II.,"The expression never is heard from the mouth of any Trojan; for Homer,"
3362,SECT. II.,"on whatever account, rarely allows them the use of the same formulæ"
3363,SECT. II.,"with the Greeks. But the whole substance of it is contained, and in a"
3364,SECT. II.,"shape even more restrictive, in the line twice spoken by Hector,"
3365,SECT. II.,
3366,SECT. II.,"Τιοίμην δ’, ὡς τιέτ’ Ἀθηναίη καὶ Απόλλων."
3367,SECT. II.,
3368,SECT. II.,"This language is indeed so pointed, that it suggests the question,"
3369,SECT. II.,"whether there must not have been some peculiar form of external honour,"
3370,SECT. II.,"which in the Heroic age was rendered to these deities, and not to"
3371,SECT. II.,others.
3372,SECT. II.,
3373,SECT. II.,"And, singularly enough, of the temples of the Homeric poems, all"
3374,SECT. II.,"that we can point out as unequivocally named, and in existence, are"
3375,SECT. II.,temples either to Apollo or to Pallas. But the phrases may also
3376,SECT. II.,have pointed towards others of their very numerous distinctions. I
3377,SECT. II.,"do not, accordingly, venture to assert that this actually was the"
3378,SECT. II.,exclusive honour of the two deities; but there is nothing absurd in
3379,SECT. II.,the supposition that it may have been so. It would not have been
3380,SECT. II.,"inconsistent with a belief in Jupiter as the highest god, that those,"
3381,SECT. II.,who were believed to be in a peculiar sense his ministers and organs
3382,SECT. II.,"for the government of the world, should either have received at the"
3383,SECT. II.,hands of mankind a larger share of the substantial tributes of worship
3384,SECT. II.,"than he did, or should have enjoyed it under a peculiar form and"

3390,SECT. II.,"objects not of partial but of universal worship, within the sphere of"
3391,SECT. II.,the knowledge of Homer.
3392,SECT. II.,
3393,SECT. II.,"Even without examination of details, the proof of this proposition"
3394,SECT. II.,might rest upon their relative positions in regard to the two parties
3395,SECT. II.,"of Greeks and Trojans. Minerva, the great Hellenizing deity, is the"
3396,SECT. II.,object of the supplicatory procession of Trojan women in the Sixth
3397,SECT. II.,Book. She is the peculiar patroness at once of the highly Pelasgian
3398,SECT. II.,"Attica[112], and of the characteristic type of Hellenic character"
3399,SECT. II.,"represented in Ulysses. On the other hand, Apollo, the one really"
3400,SECT. II.,"effective champion of the Trojans, is acknowledged by every Greek"
3401,SECT. II.,"chieftain, except Agamemnon, at the very outset of the poem[113]."
3402,SECT. II.,"Agamemnon himself has only been misled by his own avarice and passion,"
3403,SECT. II.,and he shortly sends a solemn mission to appease the offended
3404,SECT. II.,divinity[114].

3412,SECT. II.,"Setting aside the case of Jupiter, who stands on a different level,"
3413,SECT. II.,"there is nothing attaching to the other deities of the War, which"
3414,SECT. II.,at all resembles the position of command enjoyed in common by these
3415,SECT. II.,"two, both among their friends, and with those against whom they are"
3416,SECT. II.,contending. There is not even a difference of degree to be traced
3417,SECT. II.,"between the reverence paid them on the one side, and on the other."
3418,SECT. II.,
3419,SECT. II.,"When we turn to particulars, we find that Minerva has a temple in Troy,"
3420,SECT. II.,"a temple in Athens, a sacred grove in Scheria. She is worshipped by"
3421,SECT. II.,"Nestor on the sea-shore at Pylos, and, near the Minyeius; by Telemachus"
3422,SECT. II.,in Ithaca; by Ulysses and Diomed in the Greek camp. She accompanies
3423,SECT. II.,"Ulysses every where, while he is within the circle of the Greek"
3424,SECT. II.,traditions; only refrains of her own free will from going beyond it;
3425,SECT. II.,"and rejoins him when, near Scheria, he has at length again touched upon"
3426,SECT. II.,the outermost border of the Greek world.
3427,SECT. II.,
3428,SECT. II.,"There is no deity, without excepting even Jupiter, with respect to whom"
3429,SECT. II.,we have such ample evidence in the poems of the development of his
3430,SECT. II.,"worship in positive and permanent institutions, as is given in the case"
3431,SECT. II.,"of Apollo. He has a priest at Chryse, a temple in Troy, a priest and"
3432,SECT. II.,"grove at Ismarus in Thrace, a grove and festivals in Ithaca, oracles at"
3433,SECT. II.,Delos and at Delphi.
3434,SECT. II.,
3435,SECT. II.,"Besides these positive institutions, there are in Homer innumerable"
3436,SECT. II.,"marks of his influence. He worked for Laomedon, he is worshipped at"
3437,SECT. II.,Cille; the name of Lycia seems to have been probably derived from him
3438,SECT. II.,"and his attributes; the Seers, whom he endows with vision, are found"
3439,SECT. II.,"in Peloponnesus, and even among the Cyclops; he feeds the horses of"
3440,SECT. II.,"Admetus either in Pieria or in Pheræ, claims the services of Alcyone,"
3441,SECT. II.,"the daughter of Marpessa, in Ætolia, and slays the children of Niobe"
3442,SECT. II.,"near mount Sipylus. So far as the Homeric signs go, they would lead"
3443,SECT. II.,us to suppose that he was regarded by the Poet as a deity no less
3444,SECT. II.,"universal than that Scourge of Death, to which he stands in such a"
3445,SECT. II.,close and solemn relation.
3446,SECT. II.,
3447,SECT. II.,"With the exception of Jupiter, there is no other deity of whom we"
3448,SECT. II.,can so confidently assert that he receives an universal worship:
3449,SECT. II.,"and Neptune is the only other, with Minerva, in regard to whom the"
3450,SECT. II.,"indications of the poems render it probable. Of him we may infer it,"
3451,SECT. II.,from his appearing to be known or to act at places so widely separated
3452,SECT. II.,"by distance; on the Solyman mountains, in Troas under Laomedon, in"
3453,SECT. II.,"Greece near the Enipeus, in the land of the Cyclops, in the sea far"
3454,SECT. II.,north of Phæacia. But this is entirely owing to the wide extent of the
3455,SECT. II.,"θάλασσα, his portion of the great kingdom of external Nature, which,"
3456,SECT. II.,"being as broad as the Phœnician traditions of the Odyssey, at once"
3457,SECT. II.,gives him a place in them. It is clearly not due to any thing more
3458,SECT. II.,"divine in the conception of him, for he carries many chief notes of"
3459,SECT. II.,limitation in common with the divinities of pure invention.
3460,SECT. II.,
3461,SECT. II.,The wide extension of the class of Seers may of itself be taken as a
3462,SECT. II.,proof of the equally wide recognition of the influence of Apollo: for
3463,SECT. II.,"he it was who made Polypheides[115] to be first of that order, on the"
3464,SECT. II.,death of Amphiaraus. Now these Seers appear to have been found every
3465,SECT. II.,"where, under the form either of the μάντις, or of the οἰωνίστης. Not in"
3466,SECT. II.,"Greece only and in Troas proper; but in Percote, among the Mysians, and"
3467,SECT. II.,even among the Cyclops in the Outer Zone[116].

3474,SECT. II.,
3475,SECT. II.,"3. The next distinction I shall note in the traditive deities is,"
3476,SECT. II.,that they are confined to no one spot or region for their abode; a
3477,SECT. II.,"limitation, which is imposed, either more or less, upon every other"
3478,SECT. II.,prominent deity except Jupiter only.
3479,SECT. II.,
3480,SECT. II.,"With respect to some of them, this is made quite clear by positive"
3481,SECT. II.,"signs. Except when in Olympus, or else when abroad on a special"
3482,SECT. II.,"occasion, Mars does not quit Thrace, nor Vulcan Lemnos, nor Venus"
3483,SECT. II.,Paphos. But even upon higher and older deities there are signs of
3484,SECT. II.,"some kind of local limitation. The rigidly Argeian character of Juno,"
3485,SECT. II.,"though it does not express, yet implies it. Demeter would appear to"
3486,SECT. II.,"have a local abode, probably in Crete. Aidoneus and Persephone are"
3487,SECT. II.,"ordinarily confined to the Shades, where their proper business lies."
3488,SECT. II.,"Neptune himself, when dismissed from the battle-field, is desired to"
3489,SECT. II.,repair either to the sea or to Olympus. His regular worship among
3490,SECT. II.,"the Greeks was, as appears from a speech of Juno, at Helice and Ægæ"
3491,SECT. II.,"in Ægialos; which it is not easy to account for, except upon the"
3492,SECT. II.,supposition that he resided peculiarly at these places[117]. Now it is
3493,SECT. II.,expressly declared that his palace was in Ægæ: from thence he sets out
3494,SECT. II.,"for the plain of Troy, and thither he repairs when he desists from the"
3495,SECT. II.,"persecution of Ulysses. The name Ægæ is not mentioned in the Catalogue,"
3496,SECT. II.,"and Helice, as it is called εὐρεῖα, was evidently a district; thus"
3497,SECT. II.,"it may have been the district in which Ægæ stood, perhaps as its"
3498,SECT. II.,seaport[118]. Before the time of Strabo Ægæ[119] had disappeared.

3503,SECT. II.,
3504,SECT. II.,"[119] In accordance with the prevailing opinion, I take this to be the"
3505,SECT. II.,"Ægæ of Ægialus, not of Eubœa."
3506,SECT. II.,
3507,SECT. II.,"Now Minerva has a peculiar relation to Athens, and is once mentioned"
3508,SECT. II.,"as betaking herself thither[120]. Again, the epithet Λυκηγένης, rarely"
3509,SECT. II.,"given to Apollo, has suggested a connection with Lycia. If, however we"
3510,SECT. II.,"form our judgment from Homer, Lycia may derive its name from Apollo,"
3511,SECT. II.,but not Apollo from Lycia.
3512,SECT. II.,
3513,SECT. II.,"[120] Od. iii. 78-81. I may state, that were I not so fearful of"
3514,SECT. II.,"offending on the side of license, I should be inclined to suspect the"
3515,SECT. II.,hand of the diaskeuast in this passage more than in almost any other of
3516,SECT. II.,the Poems.
3517,SECT. II.,
3518,SECT. II.,"But it is plain from the poems that the influence, the activity, and"
3519,SECT. II.,"the virtual, if not positive presence of Apollo and Minerva pervade the"
3520,SECT. II.,whole Homeric world. This is shown partly by their universal action; in
3521,SECT. II.,"Troas, in Lycia[121], in Thrace, in Scheria, and all over Greece. It is"
3522,SECT. II.,also demonstrated by the manner in which prayer is addressed to them:
3523,SECT. II.,and neither the one nor the other is ever represented either as having
3524,SECT. II.,"a palace or residence in any particular spot, or as showing, like Juno,"
3525,SECT. II.,an exclusive partiality to any particular race or city.
3526,SECT. II.,
3527,SECT. II.,[121] Il. v. 105.
3528,SECT. II.,
3529,SECT. II.,4. Although invocation of divinities is frequent in the poems of
3530,SECT. II.,"Homer, it does not seem to have been sufficiently observed, that the"
3531,SECT. II.,"Olympian personages, to whom it is ordinarily addressed, are very few"
3532,SECT. II.,in number.
3533,SECT. II.,
3534,SECT. II.,"In the Twentieth Odyssey, Penelope beseeches Diana to put a period"
3535,SECT. II.,"to her mournful existence. I presume that she is here invoked, not"
3536,SECT. II.,"on account of her superiority as a traditive deity, but because the"
3537,SECT. II.,subject is connected with her especial office in regard to Death.
3538,SECT. II.,
3539,SECT. II.,Neptune again is occasionally addressed by mortals; as by his
3540,SECT. II.,"descendant Nestor on the sea-shore at Pylus, and in like manner by his"
3541,SECT. II.,"son Polyphemus, on the beach of the country of the Cyclops. So also he"
3542,SECT. II.,is invoked by the Envoys on their way to the encampment of Achilles:
3543,SECT. II.,here again their course lies along the sea-shore. I will assume
3544,SECT. II.,"accordingly, though with a good deal of doubt, that any Olympian deity"
3545,SECT. II.,might be made the object of supplication under given circumstances
3546,SECT. II.,"of time, place, or person. But it is manifest from the poems that"
3547,SECT. II.,the general rule is the other way. They are ordinarily not made the
3548,SECT. II.,"subjects of invocation, even in connection with their own peculiar"
3549,SECT. II.,"gifts. There is no invocation addressed in Homer to Venus, Mars,"
3550,SECT. II.,"Mercury, or Vulcan; nor even, which is more remarkable, to Juno."
3551,SECT. II.,
3552,SECT. II.,Prayer however is very usual in the poems: but it is confined to three
3553,SECT. II.,divinities only.
3554,SECT. II.,
3555,SECT. II.,~_Objects of habitual prayer._~
3556,SECT. II.,
3557,SECT. II.,"Jupiter, Apollo, and Pallas are addressed by persons in difficulty,"
3558,SECT. II.,"not with reference to any peculiar gift or office that they fill, but"
3559,SECT. II.,"quite independently of peculiar rites, and local or personal relations."
3560,SECT. II.,"Thus Ulysses and Diomed in the Doloneia invoke Minerva[122]. Menelaus,"
3561,SECT. II.,"when about to attack Euphorbus, prays first to Jupiter[123]. Nestor,"
3562,SECT. II.,"too, addresses Jupiter, and not his own ancestor Neptune[124], in"
3563,SECT. II.,the great straits of the Greek army. Glaucus beseeches Apollo to
3564,SECT. II.,heal his wound[125]; and if this address be thought to belong to his
3565,SECT. II.,"medical function, it is still very remarkable from its containing a"
3566,SECT. II.,"direct assertion, that he is able both to hear and to act at whatever"
3567,SECT. II.,distance. The same may be said of the prayer of Pandarus[126]. His
3568,SECT. II.,priest Chryses offers prayer to him from the plain of Troas (Il. i.
3569,SECT. II.,37): but this may be incidental to the office. The cases of prayer
3570,SECT. II.,"to Jupiter and Minerva are purely private petitions, without notice,"
3571,SECT. II.,suggested by the circumstances of the moment: and they show that
3572,SECT. II.,"though Homer had perhaps no abstract idea of omnipresence, he assigned"
3573,SECT. II.,"to these deities its essential characteristic, that is to say, the"
3574,SECT. II.,possession of powers not limited by space.

3588,SECT. II.,"protection, not simply in the exercise of particular mythological"
3589,SECT. II.,"functions, if it be less diversified is still, I think, not less"
3590,SECT. II.,"conclusive. It is, in the first place, supplied by the trine invocation"
3591,SECT. II.,repeatedly addressed to him together with Jupiter and Minerva[127]:
3592,SECT. II.,
3593,SECT. II.,"[127] Il. ii. 371, _et alibi_."
3594,SECT. II.,
3595,SECT. II.,"αἲ γὰρ, Ζεῦ τε πάτερ, καὶ Ἀθηναίη, καὶ Ἄπολλον."
3596,SECT. II.,
3597,SECT. II.,"But the general capacity of Apollo, like Minerva, to receive prayer,"
3598,SECT. II.,is demonstrated by the language of Diomed to Hector in the Eleventh
3599,SECT. II.,"Book, when Apollo was not on the battlefield (363, 4); ‘for this time,"
3600,SECT. II.,Phœbus Apollo has delivered you: and doubtless you took care to pray to
3601,SECT. II.,"him, when you ventured within the clang of spears:’"
3602,SECT. II.,
3603,SECT. II.,"νῦν αὖτέ σ’ ἐρύσσατο Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων,"
3604,SECT. II.,"ᾧ μέλλεις εὔχεσθαι, ἰὼν ἐς δοῦπον ἀκόντων."
3605,SECT. II.,
3606,SECT. II.,5. We may now pass on to another head of special prerogatives.
3607,SECT. II.,
3608,SECT. II.,~_Exempt from appetite and limitations._~
3609,SECT. II.,
3610,SECT. II.,Both Minerva and Apollo are generally exempt from the physical
3611,SECT. II.,"limitations, and from the dominion of appetite, to which the deities of"
3612,SECT. II.,"invention are as generally subject. Though, when a certain necessity"
3613,SECT. II.,"is predicated of the gods in general, they may be literally included"
3614,SECT. II.,"within it, we do not find that the Poet had them in his eye apart"
3615,SECT. II.,"from the rest, and the particular liabilities and imperfections are"
3616,SECT. II.,never imputed to either of them individually. What is said of them
3617,SECT. II.,"inclusively with others, is in reality not said of them at all, but"
3618,SECT. II.,only of the prevailing disposition of the body to which they belong:
3619,SECT. II.,"just as we are told in the Iliad (xi. 78), that all the gods were"
3620,SECT. II.,"incensed with Jupiter because of his bias towards the Trojans, when"
3621,SECT. II.,"we know that it was in reality only some among them, of the greatest"
3622,SECT. II.,"weight and power. Neither Apollo nor Minerva eats, or drinks, or"
3623,SECT. II.,"sleeps, or is wearied, or is wounded, or suffers pain, or is swayed"
3624,SECT. II.,by passion. Neither of them is ever outwitted or deluded by any deity
3625,SECT. II.,"of invention, as Venus is, and even as Jupiter is, by Juno in the"
3626,SECT. II.,"Fourteenth Iliad. When Minerva, in the shape of Mentor, receives the"
3627,SECT. II.,"cup in the Pylian festivities, she passes it on to Telemachus, but it"
3628,SECT. II.,is not stated that she drinks of it[128]. With this compare the meal of
3629,SECT. II.,"Mercury on the island of Calypso[129], the invitation to Iris to join"
3630,SECT. II.,"in the banquet of the Winds, and her own fear lest she should lose her"
3631,SECT. II.,share of the Ethiopian hecatombs[130].

3657,SECT. II.,"Chryses pleads the performance of the sacrificial rites, as one ground"
3658,SECT. II.,"of favour with the god[133]: in which, however, he is, after all, only"
3659,SECT. II.,showing that he has not failed to discharge the positive obligations
3660,SECT. II.,of his office. And of course these two were the objects of sacrifice
3661,SECT. II.,"like other deities. Had they not been so, the fact would have been in"
3662,SECT. II.,"conflict with their traditional origin, instead of sustaining it. They"
3663,SECT. II.,"stand in the same category with the rest of the Olympian company, in"
3664,SECT. II.,"that sacrifice is acceptable to them all: but first, it is plain that"
3665,SECT. II.,"they are never said to take a sensual pleasure in it; and secondly, it"
3666,SECT. II.,does not appear that their favour to individuals either was founded
3667,SECT. II.,"upon it, or when lost could be recovered by it. It is restitution, and"
3668,SECT. II.,"not sacrifice, which is sought and demanded in the case of Chryses. The"
3669,SECT. II.,moral character of the whole of those proceedings is emphatically and

3681,SECT. II.,"for Ulysses, plead in the Olympian court, before the other gods, the"
3682,SECT. II.,sacrificial bounty of those heroes respectively[135]. Nor do we here
3683,SECT. II.,"rest wholly upon negative evidence. In the First Book, the sacrifice"
3684,SECT. II.,"of the Greeks to Apollo, by the hands of Chryses, is described in the"
3685,SECT. II.,fullest detail: and the Poet tells us what it was that the god did
3686,SECT. II.,"take delight in; it was the refined pleasure of the mind and ear,"
3687,SECT. II.,afforded to him by the songs they chanted before him all the day in
3688,SECT. II.,"his honour: ὁ δὲ φρένα τέρπετ’ ἀκούων[136]. Further, the contrast may"
3689,SECT. II.,"be drawn not with divinities of their own generation only, but with"
3690,SECT. II.,"the long journeys of Neptune[137] for a feast, and with the marked and"
3691,SECT. II.,apparently unvarying language of Jupiter himself.

3711,SECT. II.,"offended by the Greeks, and Agamemnon sought to appease her with"
3712,SECT. II.,"hecatombs, it is described as a proof of his folly that he could"
3713,SECT. II.,entertain such an idea[139]:

3718,SECT. II.,
3719,SECT. II.,"With this we may contrast the case of Neptune, who had threatened"
3720,SECT. II.,to overwhelm the city of the Phæacians with a mountain; but who is
3721,SECT. II.,"apparently diverted from his purpose simply by the sacrifice which,"

3726,SECT. II.,Mere attributes of bulk stand at the bottom of the scale of even human
3727,SECT. II.,"excellence; and it is so that Homer treats them, giving them in the"
3728,SECT. II.,"greatest abundance to his Otus, his Ephialtes, and his Mars. Minerva"
3729,SECT. II.,"has them but indirectly assigned to her; and when arming for war,"
3730,SECT. II.,"Apollo never receives them at all. When his might is described, it"
3731,SECT. II.,"is always described in the loftiest manner, that is to say, in its"
3732,SECT. II.,effects; and effort or exertion is never attributed to either of them.
3733,SECT. II.,
3734,SECT. II.,Even so with respect to locomotion. The highest picture by far is that
3735,SECT. II.,"which is most negative. In general, Apollo and Minerva move without the"
3736,SECT. II.,"use of means or instruments, such as wings, chariots, or otherwise."
3737,SECT. II.,"While Neptune steps, and Juno’s horses spring, so many miles at each"
3738,SECT. II.,"pace, the journeys of Apollo and Minerva are usually undescribed,"
3739,SECT. II.,undistributed. Minerva is going from Olympus to Ithaca; when she has
3740,SECT. II.,"departed, then she has arrived:"
3741,SECT. II.,
3742,SECT. II.,βῆ δὲ κατ’ Οὐλύμποιο καρήνων ἀΐξασα·

3748,SECT. II.,supplied us with an approximative illustration of these movements over
3749,SECT. II.,"space, in the more than lightning speed of the electric telegraph."
3750,SECT. II.,
3751,SECT. II.,"So Apollo, too, has by personal dignity what the messenger gods have by"
3752,SECT. II.,"office. It is said of him and Iris, when in company, that their journey"
3753,SECT. II.,began; and that it ended:

3760,SECT. II.,"On one occasion, however, Minerva is represented, even when unattended"
3761,SECT. II.,"by any other deity, as employing the foot-wings which Mercury commonly"

3768,SECT. II.,
3769,SECT. II.,But there are no stages or intermediate points either here or elsewhere
3770,SECT. II.,in her journey.
3771,SECT. II.,
3772,SECT. II.,"With the movements of Apollo and Minerva, thus conceived by the Poet,"
3773,SECT. II.,"we may do well to compare those of Mercury (Od. v. 50-8), Neptune (Il."
3774,SECT. II.,"xiii. 17-31), and Juno (Il. xiv. 225-30)."
3775,SECT. II.,
3776,SECT. II.,~_Their independent power of punishment._~
3777,SECT. II.,
3778,SECT. II.,"6. Again, an important difference prevails between the different"
3779,SECT. II.,"divinities, in regard to the conduct they pursue when offended by"
3780,SECT. II.,"mortals. In general, this is one of the points that prominently"
3781,SECT. II.,exhibits the sovereignty of Jupiter; for the common course is to appeal
3782,SECT. II.,"to him, and to obtain retribution either with his permission or by his"
3783,SECT. II.,"agency. Not from greater self-will or a spirit of rebellion, but from"
3784,SECT. II.,"higher dignity and a certain substantiveness of character and position,"
3785,SECT. II.,"Apollo and Minerva always appear as acting for and from themselves, in"
3786,SECT. II.,vindication of their offended prerogatives.
3787,SECT. II.,
3788,SECT. II.,"Even Neptune, when he is incensed at the erection of the unconsecrated"
3789,SECT. II.,"rampart of the Greek camp, and fearful that it will eclipse the renown"
3790,SECT. II.,"of his own handiwork, the wall of Troy, appeals to Jupiter on the"
3791,SECT. II.,"subject, and receives from him the permissive suggestion, that he"
3792,SECT. II.,should himself destroy it so soon as the war is over[144]. He pursues
3793,SECT. II.,"a similar course, when he is anxious to chastise the over-boldness"
3794,SECT. II.,"and maritime success of the Phæacians[145]. Venus, wounded by Diomed,"
3795,SECT. II.,"does not even by appeal attempt to obtain redress[146]. Mars, in the"
3796,SECT. II.,"same condition, makes his complaint, both of Diomed and of Minerva,"
3797,SECT. II.,"to Jupiter. It is true that afterwards, on the death of his son, he"
3798,SECT. II.,proposes to appear on the field of battle: but then he is in a state of
3799,SECT. II.,"fury[147], and is aware that the act would be one of rebellion against"
3800,SECT. II.,"Jupiter: accordingly, it is rudely stopped by Minerva. Again, when"
3801,SECT. II.,"Dionysus and his nurses are attacked by Lycoorgus, it is Jupiter that"
3802,SECT. II.,"strikes the offender blind, and his life is short because he was become"
3803,SECT. II.,hateful to the gods[148]. Dionysus had made no appeal; but Jupiter
3804,SECT. II.,"avenged the insult to his order. The Sun, after his oxen have been"
3805,SECT. II.,"eaten by the companions of Ulysses, lodges his appeal with Jupiter and"
3806,SECT. II.,the Olympian Council: and in this case Jupiter himself undertakes to
3807,SECT. II.,give effect to the wishes of the offended luminary for vengeance[149].
3808,SECT. II.,"When Aides, or Pluto, repaired to Olympus after the wound he had"
3809,SECT. II.,"received from Hercules, the presumption perhaps arises, that it may"
3810,SECT. II.,"have been not simply to obtain the healing hand of Paieon, but also to"
3811,SECT. II.,move Jupiter for redress.

3824,SECT. II.,
3825,SECT. II.,There are indeed a certain set of cases in which the rule is probably
3826,SECT. II.,"different, that is to say, when a deity is thwarted or offended in the"
3827,SECT. II.,"exercise of his or her own special function. Thus Neptune, though he"
3828,SECT. II.,"would not touch the rampart without leave, yet of his own mere motion"
3829,SECT. II.,destroys Ajax when he is at sea. Venus threatens Helen with her summary
3830,SECT. II.,"vengeance, in case of prolonged resistance to the expressed command"
3831,SECT. II.,"that she should repair to the chamber of Paris. The Muses, offended by"
3832,SECT. II.,"Thamyris[150], proceed to maim him, probably in voice or hand, the"
3833,SECT. II.,organs connected with his profession. This power to punish within each
3834,SECT. II.,particular province appears to form an exception to the general rule.
3835,SECT. II.,"It is probably under this exceptional arrangement, that Diana proceeds"
3836,SECT. II.,"towards the Curetes, in the Legend of the Ninth Iliad: but some doubt"
3837,SECT. II.,"may hang over her case on account of the fact, that she partakes"
3838,SECT. II.,"radically of the traditional, as well as of the mythological character."
3839,SECT. II.,
3840,SECT. II.,[150] Il. ii. 594-600. It is common to render πηρὸς blind: but it would
3841,SECT. II.,"be strange that this should be meant, since blindness is associated in"
3842,SECT. II.,"the case of Demodocus with conferring the gift of song, which here is"
3843,SECT. II.,taken away (Od. vii. 64). Apollodorus (i. 3. 3.) reports that the Muses
3844,SECT. II.,had the power of blinding him by a previous agreement between him and
3845,SECT. II.,them. The more natural construction of the passage seems to be such as
3846,SECT. II.,I have ventured to point at in the text. For blindness did not maim
3847,SECT. II.,"Bards, who neither wrote nor read their compositions."
3848,SECT. II.,
3849,SECT. II.,Offended by the omission to include her in the hecatombs offered to
3850,SECT. II.,"the Immortals, she sends a wild boar to desolate the country. She puts"
3851,SECT. II.,"Ariadne to death on the application of Dionysus, without any notice of"
3852,SECT. II.,an appeal to Jupiter. In both these cases she may be acting in virtue
3853,SECT. II.,of her particular powers. But when she is matched with Juno in the
3854,SECT. II.,"Theomachy, she appears as utterly unequal to her great antagonist."
3855,SECT. II.,
3856,SECT. II.,"When Apollo comes into view, the mode of proceeding is very different"
3857,SECT. II.,from that of the deities of invention. Apollo and Diana at once destroy
3858,SECT. II.,"the children of Niobe, to avenge the insult she had offered to their"
3859,SECT. II.,"mother: and this case is the more worthy of note, because Jupiter, at"
3860,SECT. II.,"a later stage, participates in and extends the vengeance[151]. But"
3861,SECT. II.,the most conspicuous instance of the independent retributive action
3862,SECT. II.,of Apollo is in the Plague of the First Book; since here he wastes
3863,SECT. II.,"the army of the Greeks, to the great peril of the enterprise promoted"
3864,SECT. II.,"by so many powerful divinities, on account of what he esteemed a"
3865,SECT. II.,"moral offence, and an outrage to his priest Chryses. Now it is to be"
3866,SECT. II.,remembered that the damsel had suffered no peculiar wrongs: the whole
3867,SECT. II.,"offence consisted in this, that, being the daughter of a priest of"
3868,SECT. II.,"Apollo, at a place apparently insignificant, she had not been on that"
3869,SECT. II.,"account exempted from the common lot of women, but had been treated"
3870,SECT. II.,just as she would have been treated had she been a king’s daughter. Nor
3871,SECT. II.,"must we forget, in appreciating this act, that the families of priests"
3872,SECT. II.,had no priestly privilege: and that Maron paid to Ulysses (Od. ix.
3873,SECT. II.,"201-5) a very handsome price for his own life, together with that of"
3874,SECT. II.,his wife and child.
3875,SECT. II.,
3876,SECT. II.,[151] Il. xxiv. 605-9.
3877,SECT. II.,
3878,SECT. II.,It is less easy to bring out the application of the rule now before
3879,SECT. II.,"us in the case of Minerva, from the paucity of clear instances in the"
3880,SECT. II.,poems where she personally has received offence.
3881,SECT. II.,
3882,SECT. II.,"There is one important case, where her wrath appears; and it is there"
3883,SECT. II.,"described as μῆνις ὀλοὴ, and as δεινὸς χόλος[152]. Her name, and"
3884,SECT. II.,"her interest in this affair, are to some extent mixed with those of"
3885,SECT. II.,"Jupiter. The Poet tells us, that Jupiter designed for the Greeks a"
3886,SECT. II.,"calamitous Return, ‘since they were not all upright, whereupon many"
3887,SECT. II.,of them miserably perished through the inexorable wrath of Minerva.’
3888,SECT. II.,"And then the order is inverted: Agamemnon, we are told, projected the"
3889,SECT. II.,"offerings, that he might appease the anger of Minerva, and thereupon"
3890,SECT. II.,"dissension arose, for Jupiter suspended calamity over the host. It is"
3891,SECT. II.,"clear that, so far as Minerva is to be regarded as having received"
3892,SECT. II.,"separate and personal offence in this proceeding, there is no sign"
3893,SECT. II.,"of her referring to Jupiter for aid, or for permission to punish the"
3894,SECT. II.,offenders. But the case rather appears to be one in which the Poet is
3895,SECT. II.,"describing the Providential Government of the world, and in which the"
3896,SECT. II.,intermixture of the names of Jupiter and of his daughter belongs to
3897,SECT. II.,"their system of concurrent action, under which she shares with Apollo"
3898,SECT. II.,the office of acting as his habitual organ in administering retributive
3899,SECT. II.,"justice to mankind. In one clear instance, however, we find it stated,"
3900,SECT. II.,"that when the Greeks offended Minerva, she punished them by a storm"
3901,SECT. II.,(Od. v. 108).
3902,SECT. II.,

3904,SECT. II.,
3905,SECT. II.,~_They use special attributes of Jupiter._~
3906,SECT. II.,
3907,SECT. II.,"7. Apollo and Minerva carry this among other notes, that we find them"
3908,SECT. II.,"administering mythological or natural powers, which are otherwise the"
3909,SECT. II.,special property of Jupiter.
3910,SECT. II.,
3911,SECT. II.,"No other Olympian deity, but Juno, stands invested with a similar"
3912,SECT. II.,honour. We sometimes find the aerial powers of Jupiter wielded by her
3913,SECT. II.,"hand. But, with the exception of the sort of precedence accorded to her"
3914,SECT. II.,"on Olympus, in virtue of which the gods rise from their seats when she"
3915,SECT. II.,"enters their company, there is no one of the gifts that she exercises,"
3916,SECT. II.,which would not appear to lie within the range of the offices of
3917,SECT. II.,"Minerva, if not also of Apollo. In the remarkable case where she"
3918,SECT. II.,"thunders in honour of Agamemnon just after he has armed, it is recorded"
3919,SECT. II.,"that this was the joint act of the two divinities, of whom, on this"
3920,SECT. II.,"occasion, Minerva takes precedence[153]:"
3921,SECT. II.,
3922,SECT. II.,[153] Il. xi. 45.
3923,SECT. II.,
3924,SECT. II.,"ἐπὶ δ’ ἐγδούπησαν Ἀθηναίη τε καὶ Ἥρη,"
3925,SECT. II.,τιμῶσαι βασιλῆα πολυχρύσοιο Μυκήνης.
3926,SECT. II.,
3927,SECT. II.,"This association is to be observed in another passage, where these"
3928,SECT. II.,goddesses jointly communicate courage to a warrior. But when we find
3929,SECT. II.,"them associated in administering the powers of atmospheric phenomena,"
3930,SECT. II.,it is obvious that we must resort to different sources for the means
3931,SECT. II.,"of explaining the respective agencies. Juno, mythologically related to"
3932,SECT. II.,"Jupiter as a wife, in that capacity may, without exciting surprise,"
3933,SECT. II.,"take in hand what belongs, so to speak, to the _ménage_. Minerva, as a"
3934,SECT. II.,"daughter, has no such claim; and her possession of a standing ground"
3935,SECT. II.,which enables her to use these powers can only be explained by a prior
3936,SECT. II.,"and more profound affinity of traditional character, which makes her"
3937,SECT. II.,the organ of the supreme deity.
3938,SECT. II.,
3939,SECT. II.,"But while, in the highest marks of power adhering to Juno, Minerva"
3940,SECT. II.,"seems everywhere to vie with her, there are others, and those among"
3941,SECT. II.,"the most strictly characteristic of the head of Olympus, in which both"
3942,SECT. II.,"Minerva and Apollo share, but which are not in any manner imparted to"
3943,SECT. II.,Juno.
3944,SECT. II.,
3945,SECT. II.,One of the high characteristic epithets of Jupiter is αἰγίοχος. And
3946,SECT. II.,"we never hear of the Ægis out of the hands of Jupiter, except it be"
3947,SECT. II.,"in those of Minerva, or of Apollo. The Ægis is the peculiar arm of"
3948,SECT. II.,"Minerva; apparently, it _belongs_ to her; and from the description"
3949,SECT. II.,"of it in the Fifth Iliad, it appears to be the counterpart, on her"
3950,SECT. II.,"side, of the chariot on the side of Juno[154]. The tunic she puts on,"
3951,SECT. II.,"however, is the tunic of Jupiter, and the Gorgon head upon it is his"
3952,SECT. II.,sign: while the shield she carries is not to be assailed even by his
3953,SECT. II.,thunderbolt[155]:

3969,SECT. II.,"the Ægis by Minerva and Apollo, we appear to find that development of"
3970,SECT. II.,the martial character which has been mentioned above as included among
3971,SECT. II.,the Jewish ascriptions to the Messiah.
3972,SECT. II.,
3973,SECT. II.,"Proximate to, but extending beyond, the last named distinction,"
3974,SECT. II.,there is a function mythologically confined to Jupiter throughout
3975,SECT. II.,"the poems, with two exceptions only. The function is that of giving"
3976,SECT. II.,"indications, palpable to men, of coming events, by the flight of birds"
3977,SECT. II.,"in many instances, but likewise by atmospheric signs. This power is"
3978,SECT. II.,"distinguished, by its connection with the future, from a mere power"
3979,SECT. II.,over nature.
3980,SECT. II.,
3981,SECT. II.,The exceptions are Apollo and Minerva. The former deity is in general
3982,SECT. II.,"more largely endowed than Minerva in regard to the future, though a"
3983,SECT. II.,less conspicuous figure in the direction of the present. Still she
3984,SECT. II.,"partakes, with him and with Jupiter, of this peculiar honour."

3995,SECT. II.,
3996,SECT. II.,"In the final crisis of the Odyssey, which is doubtless meant to exhibit"
3997,SECT. II.,"a normal example of Providential retribution, it seems to have been"
3998,SECT. II.,the object of the Poet to divide the theurgic action between Minerva
3999,SECT. II.,"and Apollo, as joint administrators of the general government of the"
4000,SECT. II.,"world. To Minerva, as the goddess of wisdom, falls what may be called"
4001,SECT. II.,"the intellectual share[158], the actual instruction and guidance of"
4002,SECT. II.,"Ulysses, Penelope, and Telemachus, as well as the bewildering and"
4003,SECT. II.,hardening operations on the minds of the Suitors. Special arrangements
4004,SECT. II.,"appear, however, to have been introduced, so as to make a corresponding"
4005,SECT. II.,"place for Apollo. Hence it is that Theoclymenus, as the representative"
4006,SECT. II.,"of a great prophetic family, is brought into the company of Telemachus,"
4007,SECT. II.,that he may become the organ of Apollo in the remaining part of the
4008,SECT. II.,"drama. This is the more remarkable, because Theoclymenus does not repay"
4009,SECT. II.,the friendly aid he had received by taking part in the final struggle
4010,SECT. II.,on the side of Telemachus; so that his share in the proceeding stands
4011,SECT. II.,out the more conspicuously as one altogether theurgic. In cooperation
4012,SECT. II.,"with this arrangement, it is provided that the crisis shall come to"
4013,SECT. II.,"pass on the festival of the god, and that the manner of trial, by the"
4014,SECT. II.,"Bow, shall place it especially under his auspices."

4019,SECT. II.,"In the magnificent passage of the Twentieth Book[159], which describes"
4020,SECT. II.,"the phantasmagoria in the palace of Ulysses, immediately before the"
4021,SECT. II.,"trial of the Bow, there are two parts. First, the minds of the Suitors"
4022,SECT. II.,"are befooled (παρέπλαγξεν δὲ νόημα). Secondly, the hall is filled"
4023,SECT. II.,"with sensible portents: preternatural night envelopes the company,"
4024,SECT. II.,"the walls and beams are blood-bespattered, phantoms glide along with"
4025,SECT. II.,"downward movement, as on their way to Erebus, the very meat they eat is"
4026,SECT. II.,"gory, their eyes are charged with involuntary tears, their lips with"
4027,SECT. II.,"unnatural smiles. Of all this the announcement is made by Theoclymenus,"
4028,SECT. II.,a trait which I interpret as referring the array of the phenomena to
4029,SECT. II.,his master Apollo. To him is thus given that part of the operation
4030,SECT. II.,which lies within the domain of sense: while the purely intellectual
4031,SECT. II.,"one, that of stupefying the Suitors, is expressly assigned to Minerva."
4032,SECT. II.,
4033,SECT. II.,[159] Od. xx. 345-71.
4034,SECT. II.,
4035,SECT. II.,"But Minerva has likewise the power over signs, which is enjoyed by"
4036,SECT. II.,Jupiter and Apollo. As Diomed and Ulysses are setting out on their
4037,SECT. II.,"nocturnal expedition in the Tenth Iliad, Minerva sends the apparition"
4038,SECT. II.,"of a heron to cheer them[160]: they do not see it, on account of the"
4039,SECT. II.,darkness; but they hear the flapping of its wings.
4040,SECT. II.,
4041,SECT. II.,[160] Il. x. 274. Minerva’s patronage of the heron was probably
4042,SECT. II.,connected with her martial character: for it appears that in Sanscrit
4043,SECT. II.,the word _Scandha_ signifies both war and also the heron. (Welsford on
4044,SECT. II.,"the English Language, p 152.)"
4045,SECT. II.,
4046,SECT. II.,"It has accordingly attracted the attention of Nägelsbach[161], that"
4047,SECT. II.,"the power of exhibiting signs is confined to Jupiter, Juno, Apollo,"
4048,SECT. II.,and Minerva: though he has not proceeded to combine this with other
4049,SECT. II.,"distinctions, at least equally remarkable, enjoyed by the two latter"

4056,SECT. II.,the gift of speech: because it appears that the prediction of their
4057,SECT. II.,master’s death is their own; and that she only removes the barrier to
4058,SECT. II.,"its expression[162]. She stands, therefore, in a different position to"
4059,SECT. II.,that of Apollo and Minerva.

4066,SECT. II.,"part of a general dominion over nature, of which the most varied"
4067,SECT. II.,manifestation is in Minerva.
4068,SECT. II.,
4069,SECT. II.,"It is true that, in common with most of the Olympian deities, she does"
4070,SECT. II.,"not extend her action from the inner, or Greek, into the general range"
4071,SECT. II.,"of the outer, or Phœnician world. Nor does Apollo. But we have clear"
4072,SECT. II.,"proof that this was by a poetical arrangement, and not from a lack"
4073,SECT. II.,"of divine power: since (1) she does act in Scheria, and assists in"
4074,SECT. II.,bringing Ulysses to the shore of that island: (2) the class of μάντεις
4075,SECT. II.,are found among the Cyclops: (3) Calypso is amenable to the command of
4076,SECT. II.,"the Olympian court, and speaks of herself as belonging to the same wide"
4077,SECT. II.,class of deities with Aurora and Ceres. (4) Minerva assigns a special
4078,SECT. II.,"reason, namely, regard towards her uncle Neptune, for not having"
4079,SECT. II.,accompanied Ulysses all along his voyage (Od. xiii. 341).
4080,SECT. II.,
4081,SECT. II.,The power of Minerva over nature seems to be universal in kind as well
4082,SECT. II.,as in place.
4083,SECT. II.,
4084,SECT. II.,1. She and Apollo assume the human form in common with other deities:
4085,SECT. II.,but I do not find that the gods in general become visible to one person
4086,SECT. II.,without being visible to all. Minerva in the First Iliad (198) reveals
4087,SECT. II.,"herself only to Achilles. It seems as if, in Il. xvii. 321-34, Homer"
4088,SECT. II.,meant that Apollo did the same to Æneas. The recognition of Venus by
4089,SECT. II.,"Helen, I take as most probably a sign of nothing more than that the"
4090,SECT. II.,"case was one of disguise, rather than of transformation[163]."
4091,SECT. II.,
4092,SECT. II.,[163] Il. iii. 396.
4093,SECT. II.,
4094,SECT. II.,"2. Apollo frames an εἴδωλον, or image of a man, which moves and"
4095,SECT. II.,"fights[164], representing Æneas on the battle field: and Minerva frames"
4096,SECT. II.,"an εἴδωλον of Iphthime, to appear in a dream to her sister Penelope,"
4097,SECT. II.,and to convey to her a revelation of Minerva’s will[165]. This power is
4098,SECT. II.,exercised by the two divinities exclusively.

4105,SECT. II.,"sometimes in common with Apollo[167]. Ino Leucothee, the marine"
4106,SECT. II.,"goddess, becomes a water-bird, and Ὕπνος takes the form of the bird"
4107,SECT. II.,"Chalcis, when he has to act upon Jupiter. Both these operations may"
4108,SECT. II.,probably be considered as belonging to the special functions of these
4109,SECT. II.,"agents: with Apollo and Minerva, the power appears to belong to a"
4110,SECT. II.,"general supremacy over nature, which the other Olympian deities do not"
4111,SECT. II.,share.

4118,SECT. II.,"Minerva, appear to indicate some organic power over matter and life. It"
4119,SECT. II.,is not the appearance but the reality of his person that is stated to
4120,SECT. II.,"be changed. Not only is the skin wrinkled and the eye darkened, but the"
4121,SECT. II.,"hairs are destroyed. They are afterwards restored, and his stature is"
4122,SECT. II.,"increased. In like manner she gives increased height to Penelope, and"
4123,SECT. II.,again to Laertes[168].

4131,SECT. II.,"(κραιπνὸν), to speed her friend across the main[169]: and, as Juno"
4132,SECT. II.,"accelerated the setting of the sun before Troy, so Minerva forbids the"

4140,SECT. II.,Nor is the power of Minerva over nature for purposes of wrath less
4141,SECT. II.,"clear than for purposes of favour: since Mercury tells Calypso that,"

4155,SECT. II.,of the mouths of the eight Idæan rivers for nine whole days to efface

4170,SECT. II.,~_Relation of Apollo together with Diana to Death._~
4171,SECT. II.,
4172,SECT. II.,The most prominent and pointed characteristic of Apollo is one shared
4173,SECT. II.,with his sister Diana. It is the mysterious relation which these two
4174,SECT. II.,deities hold in common to death.
4175,SECT. II.,
4176,SECT. II.,"The Messianic tradition, first divided between Apollo and the great"
4177,SECT. II.,"Minerva, is now subdivided between him and his sister Diana, who forms"
4178,SECT. II.,"a kind of supplement to his divinity. The bow and arrows, the symbol"
4179,SECT. II.,"which they bear in common, marks the original union in character, out"
4180,SECT. II.,of which their twin peculiarities had grown.
4181,SECT. II.,
4182,SECT. II.,"Apollo, indeed, as we see in the first Book of the Iliad, could himself"
4183,SECT. II.,"become, like his sister, the immediate agent in the destruction of"
4184,SECT. II.,animals: but his principal function is with men. Hence the terrible
4185,SECT. II.,slaughter of the Plague: hence his extraordinary and otherwise
4186,SECT. II.,"unsatisfactory participation in the death of Patroclus: hence, above"
4187,SECT. II.,"all, though he is not the patron of Ulysses, and has no special"
4188,SECT. II.,"connection with him, yet the slaughter of the Suitors in the Odyssey"
4189,SECT. II.,"is appointed to take place on his festival, and therefore, as well as"
4190,SECT. II.,"because it is effected by the Bow, under his auspices. But again; his"
4191,SECT. II.,"office is not of a single aspect: he is a saviour from death, as well"
4192,SECT. II.,"as a destroyer. Hence it is he, and not Venus, who saves Æneas[175]:"
4193,SECT. II.,"it is he who carries Hector out of danger[176]. Yet a third, and very"
4194,SECT. II.,"peculiar form of his office do we discover, common to him and to his"
4195,SECT. II.,sister. She is upon occasion strong enough to exercise the office of
4196,SECT. II.,"destruction properly so called[177], for sometimes she slays in wrath."
4197,SECT. II.,"But more usually, as he does for men, so she more especially exercises"
4198,SECT. II.,for women the mysterious function of administering painless and gentle
4199,SECT. II.,death.

4206,SECT. II.,
4207,SECT. II.,This singular and solemn relation of Apollo and Diana to death appears
4208,SECT. II.,to have an entirely exclusive character attaching to it. There is a
4209,SECT. II.,clear distinction between death inflicted by the symbolical arrows of
4210,SECT. II.,"these twin deities, which are the symbols of an invisible Power, and"
4211,SECT. II.,"death resulting from physical or any other palpable causes, whether"
4212,SECT. II.,"it be violent, or what we term natural. I do not now speak of the"
4213,SECT. II.,"agency of Apollo the destroyer in (what we call) the Plague, nor of"
4214,SECT. II.,"his slaying Eurytus on account of a personal insult (Od. viii. 227),"
4215,SECT. II.,but of the much more distinctive and prominent office assigned to him
4216,SECT. II.,"and to Diana, that of (so to speak) taking the sting from Death. Death"
4217,SECT. II.,"by disease, Death by a broken heart[178], Death by shipwreck, or by"
4218,SECT. II.,"the lightning of heaven[179], or by the fury of Scamander, whirling"
4219,SECT. II.,"warriors to the sea, and burying them in the sand and shingle[180], are"
4220,SECT. II.,"matters altogether distinct from this. Death through second causes,"
4221,SECT. II.,even man can bring about: Death without second causes is palpably
4222,SECT. II.,Divine; and this it is that is assigned to Apollo and Diana only among
4223,SECT. II.,"the Homeric gods. There is no instance, if I remember rightly, in which"
4224,SECT. II.,"any other among them brings about the death of a mortal, otherwise than"
4225,SECT. II.,"by means of second causes. And there is one curious passage, from which"
4226,SECT. II.,it would appear that some other deities had to apply to them in order
4227,SECT. II.,to set in motion this Divine prerogative. For when Theseus was carrying
4228,SECT. II.,"Ariadne to Athens, she did not reach her journey’s end:"

4294,SECT. II.,iron band for a thread of silken slumber.
4295,SECT. II.,
4296,SECT. II.,The share of Messianic tradition accorded in this particular province
4297,SECT. II.,"to Minerva appears, as has already been observed, to consist in her"
4298,SECT. II.,peculiar power within the realm of Aidoneus himself.

4303,SECT. II.,"in which their power over Nature is exhibited, Minerva and Apollo are"
4304,SECT. II.,"not tied down, or at least are not tied down in the same degree with"
4305,SECT. II.,"the other deities generally, to the use of instruments or symbols."
4306,SECT. II.,
4307,SECT. II.,"We find that Neptune, when he has to inspire courage into the two"
4308,SECT. II.,"Ajaxes, strikes them, (Il. xiii. 59.) As an accompanying significant"
4309,SECT. II.,"act, of a nature tending by itself to produce the result, this greatly"
4310,SECT. II.,weakens the force of the passage in proof of divine or extraordinary
4311,SECT. II.,"power. In like manner, when the same divinity converts the ship of the"
4312,SECT. II.,"Phæacians into a rock, he drives it downward with his hand[186]."
4313,SECT. II.,
4314,SECT. II.,[186] Od. xiii. 164.
4315,SECT. II.,
4316,SECT. II.,But Apollo performs no such outward act when he infuses courage into
4317,SECT. II.,"Hector, or into Glaucus; or when he heals the wounds of the latter"
4318,SECT. II.,chieftain[187].

4321,SECT. II.,
4322,SECT. II.,"So likewise, when Minerva alters the personal appearance of Telemachus,"
4323,SECT. II.,"Ulysses, Laertes, or Penelope, by improving it, she uses no sign or"
4324,SECT. II.,ministrative act. Only when she effects an organic though partial
4325,SECT. II.,transformation in the case of Ulysses[188] does she strike him with
4326,SECT. II.,"her wand: but then this total transformation is an exercise of power,"
4327,SECT. II.,"of which we have no other example among the Olympian deities. Again,"
4328,SECT. II.,when Minerva finally endows the hero with heightened beauty of figure
4329,SECT. II.,"and countenance, it is done without the use of any visible sign"
4330,SECT. II.,whatever[189].

4336,SECT. II.,"This employment of instruments is, in fact, susceptible of two"
4337,SECT. II.,"significations. They may be, like the tokens of Jupiter, intended to"
4338,SECT. II.,"act upon the senses of men. But where they have not this meaning, there"
4339,SECT. II.,is a decided tendency to convey the conception of the instrument as
4340,SECT. II.,being itself the power which the deity merely directs and applies. Thus
4341,SECT. II.,it is in the cestus of Venus and the wand of Mercury that the divine
4342,SECT. II.,"energy resides[190], not less than it is in the herbs of Paieon and in"
4343,SECT. II.,the fire of Vulcan. So that any exemption from the use of these symbols
4344,SECT. II.,is a sign of belonging to a high order of deity.

4352,SECT. II.,tone and personal character of these two great divinities.

4357,SECT. II.,"It partakes indeed, as we might expect, of taint. Each has begun to"
4358,SECT. II.,give way; and each in the way adapted to their several relations with
4359,SECT. II.,man and woman’s nature respectively. Apollo’s character has just begun
4360,SECT. II.,to be touched by licentiousness: and the character of Minerva is not
4361,SECT. II.,above condescension to deceit.
4362,SECT. II.,
4363,SECT. II.,"She is nowhere, however, associated either directly or indirectly, in"
4364,SECT. II.,"word or act, with anything impure. The contest of beauty, in which"

4366,SECT. II.,"succinct one, though not quite in keeping with her highest dignity,"
4367,SECT. II.,does not imply any deviation from her elevated chastity. Neither of
4368,SECT. II.,"Juno, nor of Thetis, can the same virtue be fully predicated: both of"
4369,SECT. II.,"them, though in different modes, are brought into immediate contact"

4381,SECT. II.,"them is Hestie, who represents the impersonation of the marriage bond"
4382,SECT. II.,"and the family life, and whose exemption therefore testifies directly"
4383,SECT. II.,to the nature of the dominion from which it frees her. The other two

4387,SECT. II.,
4388,SECT. II.,The character of Apollo in this respect is by some degrees less
4389,SECT. II.,elevated: for he is an enjoying spectator of the scene described by
4390,SECT. II.,"the certainly licentious lay of Demodocus in the Eighth Odyssey, from"
4391,SECT. II.,"which the goddesses in a body absent themselves. In the legend, too,"
4392,SECT. II.,of the Ninth Iliad we find that Apollo carried off the daughter of
4393,SECT. II.,"Marpessa, afterwards named by her parents Alcyone: but this passage, we"
4394,SECT. II.,"shall see, is susceptible of an interpretation, which gives it another"
4395,SECT. II.,"construction, and one certainly far more agreeable to the general"
4396,SECT. II.,"character of this divinity. The epithet enjoyed by the Homeric Diana,"
4397,SECT. II.,"expressive of purity, is accorded by Æschylus[193] (whose accuracy and"
4398,SECT. II.,truthfulness often recall those of Homer) to Apollo;

4403,SECT. II.,
4404,SECT. II.,"And here the question arises, how did it happen that, while the element"
4405,SECT. II.,"of purity was strictly preserved in the tradition of the Wisdom, it was"
4406,SECT. II.,lost in the twin tradition of the Seed of the woman?
4407,SECT. II.,
4408,SECT. II.,"The Wisdom naturally, when impersonated, assumed the feminine form."
4409,SECT. II.,Now the character of woman seems to be in itself better fenced against
4410,SECT. II.,"impurity than that of man. Her comparatively dependent condition,"
4411,SECT. II.,and the more direct operation of her failure in this respect on the
4412,SECT. II.,"marriage tie through the disorganization of the family, have had a"
4413,SECT. II.,further influence in giving an additional stringency to the ideas of
4414,SECT. II.,mankind with respect to her observance of this virtue; a stringency
4415,SECT. II.,"not the less real, because it exemplifies the partial administration"
4416,SECT. II.,"of a law essentially just, nor because it has become rather less"
4417,SECT. II.,"conspicuous since the Gospel laid down with rigour, upon higher"
4418,SECT. II.,"grounds, one law for all. Thus it remained possible to conceive a"
4419,SECT. II.,"woman chaste, after the conditions of that idea had been almost lost"
4420,SECT. II.,in connection with the standard of excellence in the other sex: and
4421,SECT. II.,"this virtue, banished from the earth in general, still found here and"
4422,SECT. II.,"there, even down to the fœtid corruption of the time of Martial[194], a"
4423,SECT. II.,last refuge in individual cases of untainted womanhood. This course of
4424,SECT. II.,thought and feeling is exemplified in the Minerva of the Olympian Court.
4425,SECT. II.,
4426,SECT. II.,[194] Epigr. x. 63.
4427,SECT. II.,
4428,SECT. II.,"Yet the idea was not simply extinguished in the twin tradition, of"
4429,SECT. II.,"which Apollo is the chief representative. Submerged in him, a home is"
4430,SECT. II.,found for it in the appropriate form of Diana as his sister. The power
4431,SECT. II.,and majesty of this form of the Messianic tradition fall chiefly to his
4432,SECT. II.,"share: she retains what was then, to the shame of our race, thought"
4433,SECT. II.,"its less precious ingredient, freedom from sensual taint. Apollo would"
4434,SECT. II.,"have been its natural vehicle: but in him, for the reason that he was"
4435,SECT. II.,"a man, it was perhaps to the Greek mind inconceivable: a new vehicle"
4436,SECT. II.,"was either framed, or adapted, in order to carry it: the idea of the"
4437,SECT. II.,"great Deliverer that should be born was thus disintegrated, like other"
4438,SECT. II.,"traditions, and like other historical characters, which men could not"
4439,SECT. II.,so readily embrace in their integrity.
4440,SECT. II.,
4441,SECT. II.,As this is the first point in the discussion at which we have
4442,SECT. II.,"encountered an actual instance of this disintegration, it may be well"
4443,SECT. II.,to explain the meaning I attach to the term.
4444,SECT. II.,

4446,SECT. II.,
4447,SECT. II.,"It seems indubitable, that moral combinations, which are intelligible"
4448,SECT. II.,"as well as credible to one age, may become incredible to another."
4449,SECT. II.,"Just as there are individual men at every epoch, who cannot believe in"
4450,SECT. II.,"generosity and elevation of character, because they have in themselves"
4451,SECT. II.,no mirror which can reflect such qualities; so a generation ruled
4452,SECT. II.,"by more debased ideas cannot comprehend what another, influenced by"
4453,SECT. II.,"less impure tendencies, could readily embrace. On the same principle,"
4454,SECT. II.,"the Gospel gives not to the sagacious, but to the ‘pure in heart,’"
4455,SECT. II.,"the greatest triumph of mental vision, namely, that ‘they shall see"
4456,SECT. II.,God[195].’
4457,SECT. II.,

4459,SECT. II.,
4460,SECT. II.,"Accordingly, when it happens that a tradition becomes unintelligible"
4461,SECT. II.,"to the mind of a given people, it is lost. It may be lost by the"
4462,SECT. II.,disappearance even of its outward form and shell. Or it may be lost by
4463,SECT. II.,the alteration of its meaning while its words are retained. Or the work
4464,SECT. II.,of destruction may take another turn: it may be lost by being torn into
4465,SECT. II.,"pieces; the effect being that one old tradition disappears, and more"
4466,SECT. II.,than one partial substitute for it is created.
4467,SECT. II.,
4468,SECT. II.,"The highest fraud and the highest force appear to have been, according"
4469,SECT. II.,"to original tradition, joined in the Evil One: they were separated in"
4470,SECT. II.,the Grecian forms of[196] that tradition. The Apollo of Homer was still
4471,SECT. II.,"one, with a great diversity of gifts; but mythological solecisms were"
4472,SECT. II.,"already apparent in his character, like cracks in a stately building."
4473,SECT. II.,"This, too, was settled by disintegration; and in the later mythology"
4474,SECT. II.,there were many Apollos: other causes probably concurring to extend the
4475,SECT. II.,multiplying process.
4476,SECT. II.,
4477,SECT. II.,[196] Inf. Sect. iii.
4478,SECT. II.,
4479,SECT. II.,The same operation took effect upon the traditions of human character.
4480,SECT. II.,"Homer, with the finest powers of light and shade, has represented Helen"
4481,SECT. II.,"as erring, and as penitent. The moral sense of later, less simple,"
4482,SECT. II.,"and more deeply corrupted, times became impervious to a balanced"
4483,SECT. II.,"conception of this kind. Accordingly, the one Helen was torn into two,"
4484,SECT. II.,"and supplied material both for the guilty Helen, or εἴδωλον of Helen,"
4485,SECT. II.,"at Troy, and for the innocent Helen detained in Egypt. In like manner,"
4486,SECT. II.,"it became a question, probably first when Athens had grown great, how"
4487,SECT. II.,"Minos could on the one hand be great and wise, and could on the other"
4488,SECT. II.,have made war and imposed tribute upon Attica. Hence the fable of two
4489,SECT. II.,Minoses[197]: so that those who venerated the ancient traditions of
4490,SECT. II.,"Crete might still be allowed to cherish their pious sentiment, while,"
4491,SECT. II.,"upon the other hand, the Athenian dramatists might exercise a fertile"
4492,SECT. II.,imagination in inventing circumstances of horror for the biography of
4493,SECT. II.,the piratical enemy of their country.

4495,SECT. II.,"[197] Höck’s Creta, vol. ii."
4496,SECT. II.,
4497,SECT. II.,"It was, I conceive, an early example of this disintegration, which"
4498,SECT. II.,divided between Apollo and Diana different members of a primitive
4499,SECT. II.,"Messianic tradition. And, when we again combine the two personalities"
4500,SECT. II.,"of the brother and the sister in one, the tradition resumes its"
4501,SECT. II.,completeness and roundness.
4502,SECT. II.,
4503,SECT. II.,"It is likely that the same mental process, which thus deposited the"
4504,SECT. II.,"element of chastity in the person of the comparatively feeble Diana,"
4505,SECT. II.,also conferred on her the figure of the Huntress-Queen. For thus she
4506,SECT. II.,lived in seclusion from the ways and haunts of man: and it was only by
4507,SECT. II.,seclusion that she could be kept in maiden innocence.
4508,SECT. II.,
4509,SECT. II.,But although the logical turn of the Greek mind soon came to place
4510,SECT. II.,"Apollo in morally disadvantageous contrast, under this particular head,"
4511,SECT. II.,"both with his sister and with Pallas, he may be favourably compared"
4512,SECT. II.,with the other Homeric gods. There is something in the tradition that
4513,SECT. II.,"he was unshorn (ἀκερσεκόμης), which is evidently intended to connect"
4514,SECT. II.,"him with the innocence of youth. And in Homer, unless it be by the"
4515,SECT. II.,"legend of the Ninth Iliad, he is unharmed by connection with any of"
4516,SECT. II.,"those relations which assign to Jupiter, Neptune, Mars, and Mercury,"
4517,SECT. II.,human children as the fruit of their indulgence.

4520,SECT. II.,
4521,SECT. II.,The reasons which lead me to suppose that the legend of Marpessa is not
4522,SECT. II.,of a sensual character are these. The words used are[198];
4523,SECT. II.,
4524,SECT. II.,[198] Il. ix. 564.
4525,SECT. II.,
4526,SECT. II.,ὅτε μιν ἑκάεργος ἀνήρπασε Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων.
4527,SECT. II.,
4528,SECT. II.,Now none of the numerous intrigues of the mythical deities with women
4529,SECT. II.,"include violence: they always appear, so far as the language used"
4530,SECT. II.,"gives them a specific character, to have been voluntarily accepted"
4531,SECT. II.,connections[199]. It was not likely that the case of Apollo should have
4532,SECT. II.,"been the exception. Again, they are always mentioned as having led"
4533,SECT. II.,"to the birth of children: but there is no such mention in this case,"
4534,SECT. II.,"and Apollo has no human progeny. Lastly, the word used does not mean"
4535,SECT. II.,"_ravished_, but _seized and carried up_. It nearly corresponds with the"
4536,SECT. II.,"expression in the case of Ganymede[200],"

4542,SECT. II.,"τὸν καὶ ἀνηρείψαντο θεοὶ Διὶ οἰνοχοεύειν,"
4543,SECT. II.,
4544,SECT. II.,"and it may have been either a case of translation, or one in which the"
4545,SECT. II.,"maid was conceived to have been taken for the service of the deity,"
4546,SECT. II.,perhaps at the neighbouring shrine of Delphi.
4547,SECT. II.,
4548,SECT. II.,"After the part which the lay of Demodocus assigns to him, the most,"
4549,SECT. II.,"perhaps the only, discreditable transaction assigned to Apollo in"
4550,SECT. II.,the poems is the manner in which he disarms and partially disables
4551,SECT. II.,Patroclus. Nothing can be more wretched than his operations on this
4552,SECT. II.,occasion. The god comes up to the hero enveloped in cloud; strikes him
4553,SECT. II.,from behind on the back; and knocks off his armour. I can conceive
4554,SECT. II.,"but one explanation for this singular passage, which appears alike"
4555,SECT. II.,unsatisfactory from a poetical and from a mythological point of view.
4556,SECT. II.,That explanation I think is to be sought in intense nationality.
4557,SECT. II.,The main purpose of the poem required the sacrifice of a principal
4558,SECT. II.,"Greek hero: but no genuine Greek hero could be killed by fair means,"
4559,SECT. II.,therefore it was necessary to dispose of him by such as were foul. It
4560,SECT. II.,is perhaps also worth remark that the audacity of Patroclus in pushing
4561,SECT. II.,on to the city may perhaps have rendered him punishable (Il. xvi.
4562,SECT. II.,698-711).
4563,SECT. II.,
4564,SECT. II.,"It is remarkable, however, that the character of each of the two great"
4565,SECT. II.,"traditive deities had begun to give way to corruption, and each in"
4566,SECT. II.,"the point at which, according to the respective sex, its yielding"
4567,SECT. II.,"might have been anticipated. As unchastity is more readily pardoned,"
4568,SECT. II.,"according to social usage, in the man, so is deceit in the woman. And"
4569,SECT. II.,in this point the standard had already fallen for Minerva.
4570,SECT. II.,
4571,SECT. II.,"Of this we have one most clear indication, in her being commissioned"
4572,SECT. II.,to undertake the charge of inciting Pandarus to a very black act of
4573,SECT. II.,"treachery, the breach of the Pact. So far from being unwilling in this"
4574,SECT. II.,"matter, she was even eager[201];"

4590,SECT. II.,With the exception of this initial tendency to degenerate on the side
4591,SECT. II.,"of craft, we may say with truth that the highest moral tone, both of"
4592,SECT. II.,"speech and action, is reserved for Minerva in particular throughout"
4593,SECT. II.,"the poems, whether in the Olympian Court, or in her intercourse with"
4594,SECT. II.,"men. Alike in the Iliad and the Odyssey, her counsel, which prevails,"
4595,SECT. II.,undoubtedly also deserves to prevail. She is in both the champion of
4596,SECT. II.,the righteous cause. And when she states for the second time the case
4597,SECT. II.,"of Ulysses before the assembled gods, it is not now as before his"
4598,SECT. II.,"liberality in sacrifice that she pleads, but, as a last resort, she"
4599,SECT. II.,"makes bold to urge the bad moral effect which will result, if they"

4611,SECT. II.,

4615,SECT. II.,"world, on behalf, if I may so speak, of the Godhead."
4616,SECT. II.,
4617,SECT. II.,"But there were, among the inborn tendencies of polytheism, two at"
4618,SECT. II.,least which powerfully tended to give to these divinities a position
4619,SECT. II.,"not only associated with that of Jupiter, but on the one hand more"
4620,SECT. II.,"palpable and practical, and on the other of higher moral elevation."
4621,SECT. II.,"These were the tendencies which, among the incidents of his supremacy,"
4622,SECT. II.,"on the one hand, blessed him with personal repose, and, on the other,"
4623,SECT. II.,"endowed him with unbounded appetite. The first, by making Apollo and"
4624,SECT. II.,"Minerva, as his organs, the practical governors of the world, tended"
4625,SECT. II.,"to increase their importance at the expense of his, and the second"
4626,SECT. II.,gave them a moral title as it were to gain ground upon him. In the
4627,SECT. II.,time of Homer this process was considerably advanced; so that while
4628,SECT. II.,"they seem to share with Jupiter the office of general direction, which"
4629,SECT. II.,"they hold subject to his control, it falls to one of them, to Minerva"
4630,SECT. II.,"especially, to conduct the highest of all the divine processes in the"

4636,SECT. II.,"In this, Minerva shares: for she has a less perfect conformity of"
4637,SECT. II.,"will with that of Jupiter than Apollo, though she has a more profound"
4638,SECT. II.,"moral resemblance of character to the ideal, from which the Homeric"
4639,SECT. II.,"Jupiter was a depravation. Of the action before Troy, however, as a"
4640,SECT. II.,"whole, thus much remains true: that, when the will of Jupiter is to be"
4641,SECT. II.,"wrought out in favour of the Greeks, it is done entirely by Minerva,"
4642,SECT. II.,and when in favour of the Trojans it is done entirely by Apollo. Each
4643,SECT. II.,"therefore appears as the proper minister of Jupiter, when willing, for"
4644,SECT. II.,conducting the government of mankind. One of them is always willing:
4645,SECT. II.,"and though the other is not equally acquiescent, still it is the view"
4646,SECT. II.,"of the case taken by her, in common with other gods more weighty than"
4647,SECT. II.,"numerous, to which Jupiter ultimately gives way. Thus we may discern,"
4648,SECT. II.,"graven as it were upon the relation between themselves and Jupiter,"
4649,SECT. II.,the mark which shows that it was originally derived from the office
4650,SECT. II.,"of Him, ‘by whom God made the worlds[205].’ Scarcely ever do we find"
4651,SECT. II.,Homer deviate from the general rule which exhibits them as the ordinary
4652,SECT. II.,"Providence of the world for governing the detail of life. There is, I"
4653,SECT. II.,"think, but one part of the Iliad which exhibits to us any considerable"
4654,SECT. II.,assumption of this function by Jupiter himself. It is during the latter
4655,SECT. II.,"part of the day which was to be closed by a sunset fatal to Hector,"
4656,SECT. II.,"that, besides sending forth Apollo with the blinding Ægis, he himself"
4657,SECT. II.,descends to such acts of minute interference as breaking the bowstring
4658,SECT. II.,of Teucer[206].

4666,SECT. II.,"Regarded from without, these two deities appear to us as frequently"
4667,SECT. II.,receiving from men the ascriptions of Divine Providence.
4668,SECT. II.,
4669,SECT. II.,The idea of Divine Providence is frequently expressed by Homer under
4670,SECT. II.,"the names θεὸς, θεοὶ, ἀθάνατοι, δαίμων. It is also often conveyed by"
4671,SECT. II.,"the name Jupiter alone, or by such an expression as ‘Jupiter and the"
4672,SECT. II.,"other immortal gods,’ in which he appears at their head. In one place"
4673,SECT. II.,"of the Odyssey, though only one, the day being the festival of Apollo,"
4674,SECT. II.,this very extraordinary distinction is assigned to him: and the τις of
4675,SECT. II.,the Suitors thus places him at the head of the Olympian company[207];

4681,SECT. II.,
4682,SECT. II.,Sometimes mortal men look to one of these deities for success in
4683,SECT. II.,"their enterprises, even without naming Jupiter: sometimes that name"
4684,SECT. II.,"is conjoined with one of theirs. Apollo himself, appearing to Hector"
4685,SECT. II.,"in the form of Asius his uncle, exhorts that chieftain to attack"
4686,SECT. II.,"Patroclus, ‘in the hope that Apollo may give him success[208].’"
4687,SECT. II.,"Presently, Patroclus, dying, attributes Hector’s victory to Jupiter and"
4688,SECT. II.,"Apollo, his own death to Apollo and Μοῖρα[209]; Apollo, says Xanthus"
4689,SECT. II.,"the immortal horse, slew Patroclus, and gave glory to Hector[210]. This"
4690,SECT. II.,"cannot well apply to the direct agency of the god in the matter, as he"
4691,SECT. II.,"only disarmed the Greek hero. Again, when Patroclus is slain, Minerva"
4692,SECT. II.,takes no part in the proceedings. When Hector is about to be vanquished
4693,SECT. II.,"Apollo retires, and Minerva straightway appears upon the field[211]. In"
4694,SECT. II.,"the Doloneia, Ulysses and Diomed succeed, because Jupiter and Minerva"
4695,SECT. II.,"befriend them[212]. Minerva rejoices, when she finds her name invoked"
4696,SECT. II.,first of all the gods[213]: and she instructs Laertes to call upon
4697,SECT. II.,"Jupiter with herself, assuming for her own name the first place;"

4715,SECT. II.,"Agamemnon feels that he is certain to take Troy, if only Jupiter and"

4717,SECT. II.,"favour of Jupiter and Minerva[216].’ But in fact, the whole scheme of"

4719,SECT. II.,"Minerva and not by Jupiter, as is twice declared to us from his own"

4721,SECT. II.,"grandeur, in which Jupiter and Minerva are combined, as joint arbiters"
4722,SECT. II.,"of great events. In the Sixteenth Odyssey, Telemachus exhorts his"
4723,SECT. II.,"father, amid their gloomy and doubtful prospects, to bethink him of"
4724,SECT. II.,"obtaining some ally. He nobly replies as follows: ‘I will tell you, and"
4725,SECT. II.,"do you answer me and say, whether Athene with Zeus her father will not"
4726,SECT. II.,"suffice for us, or whether I shall study to find some other defender.’"
4727,SECT. II.,"The rejoinder of Telemachus is in the same exalted strain. ‘Yes, these"
4728,SECT. II.,"are good, though they be afar off, sitting on high; for they prevail"
4729,SECT. II.,"over all others, whether they be men, or whether they be immortal"
4730,SECT. II.,gods[218].’

4744,SECT. II.,"reservation of the higher parts to Jupiter. On the contrary, in what"
4745,SECT. II.,"we may call external and wholesale Providence, Jupiter is supreme;"
4746,SECT. II.,"and in the conflict between Ulysses and the Ithacan rebels, as well"
4747,SECT. II.,"as in various passages of the Iliad relating to external action,"
4748,SECT. II.,Jupiter interposes to check her eager spirit. In the last Odyssey she
4749,SECT. II.,asks his designs. He recommends a pacification. She thereupon exhorts
4750,SECT. II.,and assists old Laertes to begin the battle. At length a thunderbolt
4751,SECT. II.,"descends from Jupiter, and it falls at Minerva’s feet. She then"

4765,SECT. II.,"doom: for Minerva fettered him, that he should fall beneath the hand"
4766,SECT. II.,"of Telemachus[220]. And further, she works inwardly on the minds of"
4767,SECT. II.,"the Suitors, ‘not suffering them,’ such is the remarkable phrase, ‘to"
4768,SECT. II.,abstain from their biting insolence:’ so that pain might yet more

4779,SECT. II.,This passage is subsequently repeated; and it stands as one of those
4780,SECT. II.,"remarkable Homeric formulæ, which are used with such extraordinary"
4781,SECT. II.,grandeur of effect in the later books of the Odyssey; returning upon
4782,SECT. II.,the ear like the solemn tolling of a funeral bell.
4783,SECT. II.,
4784,SECT. II.,But the sentiments which the passage contains are in themselves most
4785,SECT. II.,"remarkable, and perhaps only find a parallel in the awful language"
4786,SECT. II.,"of Holy Writ; ‘and the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart, that he should"
4787,SECT. II.,not let the people go[222].’ They describe at once the doctrine of
4788,SECT. II.,"Providence, and the essential laws of human nature, in their loftiest"
4789,SECT. II.,and severest form. They show us the hardening power of a long continued
4790,SECT. II.,"course of offences against the moral law, which at length converts the"
4791,SECT. II.,"most unbounded license into the most absolute slavery, under the iron"
4792,SECT. II.,yoke of habitual depravity; and they likewise exhibit the figure of
4793,SECT. II.,"Deity superintending this terrible, but natural as well as judicial"
4794,SECT. II.,"retribution, which is the ultimate and effective sanction of the whole"
4795,SECT. II.,"moral code, alike in the earlier and in the later stages of the Divine"
4796,SECT. II.,"dispensations. Besides all this, the passage exhibits to us pain"
4797,SECT. II.,"administered to the just man, in order to prove his resolution, and"
4798,SECT. II.,"steel him, that he may be the fitting minister of divine vengeance."
4799,SECT. II.,Nor does this process of probation cease here: for the conflict with
4800,SECT. II.,"the Suitors is a prolonged one; and it is prolonged, because Minerva"
4801,SECT. II.,"was still making trial of the constancy of Ulysses and his son[223], as"
4802,SECT. II.,of metal in the fire.

4806,SECT. II.,[223] Od. xxii. 236.
4807,SECT. II.,
4808,SECT. II.,It is hard to find even approximations to such a picture in the later
4809,SECT. II.,"heathen literature, particularly after Æschylus: and in Homer no"
4810,SECT. II.,function of this kind is ever attributed to an ordinary deity; nor even
4811,SECT. II.,"to Jupiter, whose place in the government of mankind, if estimated"
4812,SECT. II.,"morally, is lower than that of Minerva. I shall have occasion shortly"
4813,SECT. II.,to glance further at this subject.
4814,SECT. II.,
4815,SECT. II.,The higher powers attaching to the character of the great Deliverer
4816,SECT. II.,"of man, besides being more or less obscured in each case, are by the"
4817,SECT. II.,"disintegration, with which we may now have become familiar, divided"
4818,SECT. II.,"between Apollo and Minerva; so that while in some, and indeed in most,"
4819,SECT. II.,"points of view, it is a common character which distinguishes and severs"
4820,SECT. II.,"them from the deities of mere invention, in others we must combine the"
4821,SECT. II.,"gifts of one with those of the other, in order to get at the entire"
4822,SECT. II.,outline of the ancient tradition.
4823,SECT. II.,
4824,SECT. II.,"Thus we have seen, that Minerva exercises higher functions in"
4825,SECT. II.,"Providential government, and in the administration of the general"
4826,SECT. II.,"laws of our nature, than are wielded even by the Homeric Jupiter."
4827,SECT. II.,"We have also partially considered why it is, that she thus attains"
4828,SECT. II.,"a superiority which, undoubtedly, no pristine tradition could while"
4829,SECT. II.,"unaltered accord to her. At present I proceed to observe, that we may"
4830,SECT. II.,find a counterpart to this paramount prerogative of Minerva in the gift
4831,SECT. II.,"of fore and after knowledge, possessed most peculiarly and largely by"
4832,SECT. II.,Apollo.
4833,SECT. II.,
4834,SECT. II.,"Calchas, Seer of the Greek army, knew what was, what had been, and what"
4835,SECT. II.,"was to be, by the gift which Phœbus Apollo had conferred on him[224]."
4836,SECT. II.,"It is the business of this order, who are ministers of Apollo, to"
4837,SECT. II.,interpret all signs and presages to men in virtue of the prerogative
4838,SECT. II.,"of that deity. In the Fifteenth Book, indeed, Apollo inquires of"
4839,SECT. II.,Hector the cause of his evil plight: but he has not yet put off his
4840,SECT. II.,"_incognito_, as we see from the reply of Hector;"
4841,SECT. II.,
4842,SECT. II.,[224] Il. i. 69-72.
4843,SECT. II.,
4844,SECT. II.,"τίς δὲ σύ ἐσσι, φέριστε θεῶν[225];"
4845,SECT. II.,
4846,SECT. II.,[225] Il. xv. 247.
4847,SECT. II.,
4848,SECT. II.,"And, while Jupiter has the single and remote oak of Dodona for the"
4849,SECT. II.,"delivery of oracles to men, Apollo has already his Pythian temple in"
4850,SECT. II.,"the very heart of Greece, and hard by the great highway across the"
4851,SECT. II.,"Corinthian gulf, and has likewise a shrine at Delos for that purpose;"
4852,SECT. II.,"for we must presume that, when Ulysses[226] stopped to visit Delos on"
4853,SECT. II.,"his way home, it was in order to obtain information as to his fate."
4854,SECT. II.,Thus Apollo appears to stand first of the gods in regard to knowledge
4855,SECT. II.,"of events, as Minerva does with respect to the ordinary government"
4856,SECT. II.,of mankind. Nor does Homer scruple to call this favourite divinity
4857,SECT. II.,"the first of the gods; an expression, however, which he employs with"
4858,SECT. II.,"latitude, and which must not be too rigidly construed[227]:"

4865,SECT. II.,
4866,SECT. II.,"I have already observed that the abstract words θεὸς and θεοὶ, which"
4867,SECT. II.,"are generally used by Homer to convey the idea of Providence, are when"
4868,SECT. II.,"so used commonly referable in the main to Jupiter, so far as we can"
4869,SECT. II.,"connect them at all with any of the Olympian personages. Sometimes,"
4870,SECT. II.,"however, they are determined by the sense of the passage to signify"
4871,SECT. II.,"Minerva or Apollo; but I think they never, when they relate to"
4872,SECT. II.,"Providential action, mean any other divinity."
4873,SECT. II.,
4874,SECT. II.,"It is by no means from any merely national, or even personal"
4875,SECT. II.,"predilection, but it is mainly from the lofty standing ground of a"
4876,SECT. II.,"Providence, that Minerva follows Ulysses: it is in the same general"
4877,SECT. II.,character that Apollo is made a party in the final crisis of the
4878,SECT. II.,"Odyssey through the introduction of his festival, and of the Bow."
4879,SECT. II.,
4880,SECT. II.,"In the Olympian assemblage, it is Minerva who really represents the"
4881,SECT. II.,element of mind and its inborn supremacy over all other forces. She
4882,SECT. II.,"proceeds upon principles, when Juno acts upon partial attachments; and"
4883,SECT. II.,"her superiority is so great, as to be wholly inexplicable under the"
4884,SECT. II.,hypothesis which would represent the characters and attributes of all
4885,SECT. II.,alike as the mere products of invention.
4886,SECT. II.,
4887,SECT. II.,~_Intimacy of Minerva’s personal relations._~
4888,SECT. II.,
4889,SECT. II.,"The offices of both these deities, but especially of Minerva, in"
4890,SECT. II.,"relation to the guidance of human conduct, are much higher than those"
4891,SECT. II.,of any other deity in their kind. Not only do they both act in the
4892,SECT. II.,"largest and most free manner on the human mind by inward influence,"
4893,SECT. II.,"but, if there is any trace in the Homeric system of what may be called"
4894,SECT. II.,"spiritual religion, of the tender and intimate relations which have"
4895,SECT. II.,from the first subsisted between the children of faith and their Father
4896,SECT. II.,"in Heaven, it is in Minerva that we must seek for it. It is indeed but"
4897,SECT. II.,a faint resemblance that we shall find; the very application of the
4898,SECT. II.,"word may be disputable. Yet it is something, which appears to show that"
4899,SECT. II.,"it was at any rate not of heathen origin: that it is a flower, sickly,"
4900,SECT. II.,"because transplanted from a better to a less kindly soil; a shadow,"
4901,SECT. II.,"or a wreck of something greater and better, and not a scheme built up"
4902,SECT. II.,from beneath. The mode in which Minerva cares for Ulysses deserves at
4903,SECT. II.,"least thus much of honour. It is a contact so close and intimate, a"
4904,SECT. II.,"care so sleepless and so tender, embracing alike the course of events"
4905,SECT. II.,"without, and the state of mind within; so affectionate in relation to"
4906,SECT. II.,"the person, yet so entirely without the least partiality or caprice; so"
4907,SECT. II.,"personal, yet so far from what Holy Scripture calls, with the highest"
4908,SECT. II.,"perfection of phrase, respect of persons; so deeply founded on general"
4909,SECT. II.,"laws of truth and justice, even if some deviations can be detected,"
4910,SECT. II.,"by a jealous eye, in the choice of subsidiary means; that, as it is"
4911,SECT. II.,without any thing like a parallel in the ruder and meaner relations
4912,SECT. II.,"of men with the deities of invention, so it makes its own audible and"
4913,SECT. II.,legitimate claim to a higher origin. The principle at least of inward
4914,SECT. II.,and sustained intercourse between the Deity and the soul of man is
4915,SECT. II.,perceptibly represented to us by the literature of Greece in a case
4916,SECT. II.,"like this, and, with the very partial and qualified exception of the"
4917,SECT. II.,"δαίμων of Socrates, in such a case only."
4918,SECT. II.,
4919,SECT. II.,"Minerva, again, can affect the mind with a friendly bewilderment;"
4920,SECT. II.,as when she paralyses for a moment the understanding of the nurse
4921,SECT. II.,"Euryclea, that she may not give an answer, which would be inconvenient,"
4922,SECT. II.,to the question of Penelope[228]. To her Ulysses looks for the right
4923,SECT. II.,rearing of his son: and she assures him he need have no anxiety[229].
4924,SECT. II.,"Even as respects the human person, no powers so large are any where"
4925,SECT. II.,"ascribed by Homer to any other deity as those which she exercises,"
4926,SECT. II.,especially in the transformation and re-transformation of Ulysses.

4931,SECT. II.,
4932,SECT. II.,~_Form of their relation to their attributes._~
4933,SECT. II.,
4934,SECT. II.,"3. Another very remarkable distinction, or rather cluster of"
4935,SECT. II.,"distinctions, attaching to these deities, relates to the manner in"
4936,SECT. II.,"which they bear their attributes. Speaking generally, the deities of"
4937,SECT. II.,"pure invention are the mere impersonations of a passion, or of an"
4938,SECT. II.,"elemental or bodily power, or of a mental gift. They are, in the order"
4939,SECT. II.,"of ideas, posterior and ministerial to their own attributes: the mere"
4940,SECT. II.,"vehicles for carrying them into movement and action, so that in truth"
4941,SECT. II.,"the persons are the embellishments and the attributes of qualities,"
4942,SECT. II.,and not the qualities attributes of persons. To state it at the very
4943,SECT. II.,"highest, the inventive divinity is the steward of his own gifts."
4944,SECT. II.,
4945,SECT. II.,Now the traditive god is their proprietor and master. In the case of
4946,SECT. II.,"the two great traditive deities, Apollo and Minerva, the relation"
4947,SECT. II.,between function and person exactly reverses that which has been
4948,SECT. II.,"described. Here the attribute is something attached to, something in"
4949,SECT. II.,"the possession and under the command of, the person; as much so, as"
4950,SECT. II.,"the unerring bow of Apollo, or the invincible spear of Minerva. It is"
4951,SECT. II.,"not Apollo, but it is the bow of Apollo, which stands in the relation"
4952,SECT. II.,"to his office as minister of death, that Vulcan himself bears to the"
4953,SECT. II.,"element of fire and to the metallic art, or Mars to the passions and"
4954,SECT. II.,the strong hand of war. If we except the single case of the choice
4955,SECT. II.,"garment of Juno[230], Minerva neither spins nor hammers. Mars always"
4956,SECT. II.,"appears fighting, but Apollo does not always appear prophesying or"
4957,SECT. II.,"playing the lyre, a function which he seems to perform only in the"
4958,SECT. II.,company of the gods.
4959,SECT. II.,
4960,SECT. II.,[230] Il. xiv. 178.
4961,SECT. II.,
4962,SECT. II.,"The difference is strongly marked in Homer, by the fact that the"
4963,SECT. II.,invented divinities of the second order are identified in common
4964,SECT. II.,language with their offices. Ares is a synonym for a spear: fire
4965,SECT. II.,"is φλὸξ Ἡφαίστοιο, or even simply Ἥφαιστος[231]: the name Ἠέλιος is"
4966,SECT. II.,absolutely identified with a great natural object: corn is Δημήτερος
4967,SECT. II.,ἀκτή. But no analogous phrase is applicable to Apollo or to Minerva in
4968,SECT. II.,"Homer. As, with the lapse of time, the will and fancy of man did its"
4969,SECT. II.,"work more fully upon the idea of deity, the names of other divinities"
4970,SECT. II.,fell within the circle; and the remembrance of tradition having become
4971,SECT. II.,"fainter and fainter, in the time of Horace the word Minerva could be"
4972,SECT. II.,used for wit (Hor. Sat. II. ii. 3);
4973,SECT. II.,
4974,SECT. II.,[231] Il. ii. 426.
4975,SECT. II.,
4976,SECT. II.,"Rusticus, abnormis sapiens, crassâque Minervâ."
4977,SECT. II.,
4978,SECT. II.,"But, as is often the case, in this change, external as it is, and"
4979,SECT. II.,"apparently slight, we have an outward sign of the profound alterative"
4980,SECT. II.,"process, which in Homer’s time had largely begun, and which continued"
4981,SECT. II.,until the incrustation and absorption of religious truth became entire.
4982,SECT. II.,
4983,SECT. II.,~_Their capacity to attract new ones._~
4984,SECT. II.,
4985,SECT. II.,"4. In conformity with the last-named indication is another, which I"
4986,SECT. II.,have next to notice. The traditive god is capable of receiving new
4987,SECT. II.,functions; apparently because he is not the servant of the old ones:
4988,SECT. II.,"but the deity who is a mere personal expression for a certain idea,"
4989,SECT. II.,"can, as a general rule, have no duty or prerogative beyond its bounds,"
4990,SECT. II.,more than can a counter beyond the thing which it has been chosen to
4991,SECT. II.,"signify. Hence Vulcan, Venus, Mars, Ceres, Bacchus, even Mercury,"
4992,SECT. II.,"the god of gain, continue, after as well as in Homer, to be devoted"
4993,SECT. II.,to and identified with their several functions. Only in the case of
4994,SECT. II.,"Mercury, as traffic involves motion from place to place, and the"
4995,SECT. II.,"acts of both honest and dishonest persuasion, he is in Homer, and he"
4996,SECT. II.,"afterwards continues to be more generally, a messenger and conductor,"
4997,SECT. II.,"a negotiator and a rhetorician, as well as a thief. But even Juno,"
4998,SECT. II.,"elevated as she is in station, yet, having been called into Olympus as"
4999,SECT. II.,"a vehicle for conveying the idea of maternity, continues to be charged"
5000,SECT. II.,"with that office, and is not specifically invested with any other."
5001,SECT. II.,"Such attributions as are implied in the Venus Victrix, or other like"
5002,SECT. II.,"dedications, are indeed at variance with these propositions; but they"
5003,SECT. II.,"belong to a later and greatly altered state of the old mythology, when"
5004,SECT. II.,"it had reached to an immeasurable distance from its source, and had"
5005,SECT. II.,lost the traces even of its own early features. But in the cases of
5006,SECT. II.,"Apollo and Minerva, we perceive that the traditive deity was not thus"
5007,SECT. II.,"‘cabined, cribbed, confined.’"
5008,SECT. II.,
5009,SECT. II.,We find the Apollo of Homer the deity of the following particular
5010,SECT. II.,functions:
5011,SECT. II.,
5012,SECT. II.,"1. The lyre and poetry, Il. i. 603."
5013,SECT. II.,
5014,SECT. II.,"2. Divination, Il. i. 72."
5015,SECT. II.,
5016,SECT. II.,"3. Healing, Il. xvi. 517."
5017,SECT. II.,
5018,SECT. II.,"4. The bow, Il. i. 49. ii. 827."
5019,SECT. II.,
5020,SECT. II.,"5. Death, either gentle and painless, or not referable to any known"
5021,SECT. II.,"cause, such as ordinary disease or wounds."
5022,SECT. II.,
5023,SECT. II.,"Besides all this, he may be called, with Pallas, the god of Help in"
5024,SECT. II.,"general; and, even within the range of single attributes, he shews an"
5025,SECT. II.,immense diversity. He was the god at once of the severe and simple
5026,SECT. II.,"music of the Dorians[232], and of the rabid ecstasy of the Pythoness."
5027,SECT. II.,
5028,SECT. II.,"[232] Müller’s Dorians, II. viii. 12."
5029,SECT. II.,
5030,SECT. II.,It is hardly possible that he could have begun his career in the Greek
5031,SECT. II.,"mythology with such an assemblage of functions, not only not united"
5032,SECT. II.,"by any obvious tie, but some of them in apparent contradiction with"
5033,SECT. II.,one another. Probably the constitutive ideas of the tradition he
5034,SECT. II.,represented were fitted out by a gradual process with this outward
5035,SECT. II.,"apparatus of prerogatives; each of which, when taken singly, was in"
5036,SECT. II.,harmony with them. Nor was the operation completed even in the time of
5037,SECT. II.,"Homer, as we see from the curious case of the Sun."
5038,SECT. II.,
5039,SECT. II.,"We may, I apprehend, view that case in either of two aspects. We"
5040,SECT. II.,may consider what was historically the progress of the traditions
5041,SECT. II.,"concerning the Sun from their source to their maturity, when they were"
5042,SECT. II.,incorporated into the comprehensive deity of Apollo: or we may examine
5043,SECT. II.,"the moral affinities, which determined the direction and conclusion of"
5044,SECT. II.,their career.
5045,SECT. II.,
5046,SECT. II.,"Historically, I presume that the Homeric tradition of the Sun"
5047,SECT. II.,"represents a separate and recent importation from a foreign country,"
5048,SECT. II.,which had not as yet been fitted into a place of its own in the Greek
5049,SECT. II.,"mythology. It therefore wanders as it were unappropriated, and hangs in"
5050,SECT. II.,temporary suspense.
5051,SECT. II.,
5052,SECT. II.,"The Apollo had already undergone a formative process, and the ornaments"
5053,SECT. II.,of fancy had been embroidered upon the tissue of an ancient tradition.
5054,SECT. II.,"After Homer’s time, the function of animating and governing the Sun was"
5055,SECT. II.,"added to the multifarious offices of that deity. As respects himself,"
5056,SECT. II.,this is a proof that his receptiveness was not yet exhausted; that he
5057,SECT. II.,"was independent and disengaged. As respects the Ἠέλιος, this result"
5058,SECT. II.,"shows that there was some sympathy or moral gravitation, which led to"
5059,SECT. II.,the absorption of this Homeric divinity in Apollo.
5060,SECT. II.,
5061,SECT. II.,"The oscillating condition of that conception in the Homeric poems, and"
5062,SECT. II.,"the indeterminate state of its affinities, will be considered in the"
5063,SECT. II.,next Section.
5064,SECT. II.,
5065,SECT. II.,~_Wide range of their functions._~
5066,SECT. II.,
5067,SECT. II.,"In Homer the deities of invention are, without an exception, limited"
5068,SECT. II.,"either to a single function (and this in the great majority of cases),"
5069,SECT. II.,"or to functions which are connected, as in the case of Mercury,"
5070,SECT. II.,"with one common and central idea, itself such as may belong to a"
5071,SECT. II.,"mythological formation. But there is no such idea on which, as on a"
5072,SECT. II.,"string, we can possibly hang all the various attributes of Homer’s"
5073,SECT. II.,Apollo: and the case becomes stronger when we find that it is this very
5074,SECT. II.,"god, already (if he be mythological only) quite overstocked, who shows"
5075,SECT. II.,a yet further capacity to absorb into his own person new powers of
5076,SECT. II.,"divinity, which in Homer’s time as yet stood apart from him."
5077,SECT. II.,
5078,SECT. II.,"As respects mere multiplicity and diversity of function, the case of"
5079,SECT. II.,Minerva is somewhat less marked than that of Apollo: for it may be
5080,SECT. II.,practicable to associate together all her offices as they are described
5081,SECT. II.,"in Homer, around one grand combination of Power with Wisdom, as their"
5082,SECT. II.,"central point. But even then, when we consider that she supremely"
5083,SECT. II.,"administers political society, personal conduct, war, and skilled"
5084,SECT. II.,"industry, in fact that the whole intelligence of the world, individual"
5085,SECT. II.,"and collective, appears to be under her paramount guidance, besides all"
5086,SECT. II.,"the power she exercises over inanimate and animate nature, and even in"
5087,SECT. II.,"the innermost sphere of personal action, we perceive that, apart from"
5088,SECT. II.,"the elevation and glory of her position, the range of her gifts goes"
5089,SECT. II.,"to an extent which, simply as such, could never have been assigned by"
5090,SECT. II.,mere human invention to any deity but the supreme one. The idea of
5091,SECT. II.,"the goddess of Wisdom, conceived as largely as it must be in order to"
5092,SECT. II.,"cover all Minerva’s Homeric attributes, leaves no room for the other"
5093,SECT. II.,conceptions necessary to fit out a mythology.
5094,SECT. II.,
5095,SECT. II.,For what a range do these attributes include!
5096,SECT. II.,
5097,SECT. II.,"Minerva is in heaven armed with such power that to none of the gods,"
5098,SECT. II.,"except Jove only, and to him scarcely, does she succumb. She is supreme"
5099,SECT. II.,"in war, supreme in policy, supreme in art; supreme in prudence and"
5100,SECT. II.,the practical business of life; supreme in manual skill; supreme in
5101,SECT. II.,or over all contests of force: while at the same time the lower and
5102,SECT. II.,"executory parts of each of these functions, where she drops them, are"
5103,SECT. II.,"taken up, as we have seen, by deities far inferior to her, though still"
5104,SECT. II.,"of the first or Olympian order. Even physical strength, if combined"
5105,SECT. II.,"with skill, is under her supreme management: for it is through her aid"
5106,SECT. II.,"that Tydeus wins in the games at Thebes[233], as well as Mecisteus on"
5107,SECT. II.,"another occasion, and that Nestor conquers Ereuthalion[234]."

5118,SECT. II.,
5119,SECT. II.,There can be no doubt which of these two war-divinities was superior
5120,SECT. II.,and which subordinate; the exploit of Diomed alone would avail to
5121,SECT. II.,settle the question: but more direct evidence is to be found in the
5122,SECT. II.,singular passage which describes Minerva as invested with the charge
5123,SECT. II.,"of chastising Mars, and in the mode after which, in the Fifteenth and"
5124,SECT. II.,"Twenty-first Books, she herself recognises and fulfils the obligation"
5125,SECT. II.,of her office. (Il. v. 766. xv. 123-42).
5126,SECT. II.,
5127,SECT. II.,"Again, her name is connected with that of Vulcan as to his own"
5128,SECT. II.,special and sole art of working in metals. Twice in the Odyssey the
5129,SECT. II.,"silversmith is introduced in a simile, and he is called a man educated"

5136,SECT. II.,
5137,SECT. II.,Only in the arts of tissue and embroidery she seems to have no
5138,SECT. II.,coadjutor. This probably is on account of their purely feminine
5139,SECT. II.,character. But generally all the principles and foundations of art are
5140,SECT. II.,hers. Thus she even teaches mensuration to the carpenter[237]:

5147,SECT. II.,"As some of her distinctive epithets, like ἐρυσίπτολις, φθισίμβροτος"
5148,SECT. II.,"refer especially to war, so she has others which look either mainly"
5149,SECT. II.,or exclusively to the supreme care of political order. Such are
5150,SECT. II.,"ἀλαλκομένηις, λαόσσοος, and ἀγελείη (collector or leader of a people)."
5151,SECT. II.,It is the executory duty that is intrusted to Themis. She is the
5152,SECT. II.,"messenger, who summons the deities, and she both collects and dissolves"
5153,SECT. II.,"human assemblies[238]: thus discharging a subordinate function, where"
5154,SECT. II.,"Pallas is the presiding goddess. It is probably for this reason that,"
5155,SECT. II.,"notwithstanding the strong political spirit of Homer, we find Themis"
5156,SECT. II.,act so secondary a part in Olympus.

5164,SECT. II.,
5165,SECT. II.,"Over and above all these offices, which seem to have a connection with"
5166,SECT. II.,"her ordinary attributes, she appears to share in the most recondite and"
5167,SECT. II.,peculiar functions of other deities. She enters into Apollo’s knowledge
5168,SECT. II.,of the future; for in the Ithacan cave she foretells to Ulysses all
5169,SECT. II.,"that he has yet to suffer. Her power even descends, as we have seen,"
5170,SECT. II.,into the nether world. It seems as if this power in the Shades were
5171,SECT. II.,"the portion falling to her out of the supremacy over death, assigned"
5172,SECT. II.,"by tradition to the Messiah. And she has also, if not the jurisdiction"
5173,SECT. II.,"over death lodged peculiarly in her hands, a faculty yet more wonderful"
5174,SECT. II.,"ascribed to her, that of staying its approach; for Euryclea bids"
5175,SECT. II.,"Penelope in her distress pray to Minerva, who can deliver Telemachus"
5176,SECT. II.,"from death; that is, can raise him up again:"
5177,SECT. II.,
5178,SECT. II.,ἡ γάρ κέν μιν ἔπειτα καὶ ἐκ θανάτοιο σαώσαι[239].
5179,SECT. II.,
5180,SECT. II.,[239] Od. iv. 750-3.
5181,SECT. II.,
5182,SECT. II.,In truth it seems to be the distinctive character of Minerva in the
5183,SECT. II.,"Homeric theo-mythology, that though she is not the sole deity, yet"
5184,SECT. II.,the very flower of the whole office and work of deity is every where
5185,SECT. II.,reserved for her: and though she is not directly invested with the
5186,SECT. II.,"external form and body of every gift, yet she has the heart, essence"
5187,SECT. II.,"and virtue of them all; insomuch that, practically, no limit can be"
5188,SECT. II.,placed upon her powers and functions. The whole conception is therefore
5189,SECT. II.,fundamentally at variance with the measured and finite organization of
5190,SECT. II.,"an invented system of religion, and by its own incongruities with that"
5191,SECT. II.,system it proves itself to be an exotic element.
5192,SECT. II.,
5193,SECT. II.,"By another path, we arrive at the very same conclusion for Apollo. He"
5194,SECT. II.,"too has much of that inwardness and universality of function, which"
5195,SECT. II.,"belongs to Minerva, as well as a diversity of offices peculiarly his"
5196,SECT. II.,own. But the argument here admits of being presented in a different
5197,SECT. II.,form. All his peculiar gifts in Homer are referable to one of three
5198,SECT. II.,"characters, those of Prophet, Deliverer, and Avenger, or Judge. In the"
5199,SECT. II.,"first, gifted with all knowledge, he is also the God of Song, which was"
5200,SECT. II.,"its vehicle. In the second, he is the hearer of prayer, the healer of"
5201,SECT. II.,"wounds, the champion of Heaven itself against rebellion. In the third,"
5202,SECT. II.,"he punishes the guilty, and especially administers the one grand penal"
5203,SECT. II.,"law of death. All this he does as the organ of one, with whom in will"
5204,SECT. II.,he is perfectly united. The tangled thread runs out without knot or
5205,SECT. II.,"break, when we unravel it by primitive Messianic tradition; because it"
5206,SECT. II.,"was fundamental in that tradition, that the person who was the subject"
5207,SECT. II.,"of it, should exhibit this many sided union of character and function."
5208,SECT. II.,"But could Deliverance and Destruction, there combined, any where else"
5209,SECT. II.,"have been read otherwise than as contradictory to one another, and"
5210,SECT. II.,incapable of being united in the same being?
5211,SECT. II.,
5212,SECT. II.,~_The conflicting Characters of Apollo._~
5213,SECT. II.,
5214,SECT. II.,"I know no other principle, on which we can satisfactorily explain"
5215,SECT. II.,"either the double character of Apollo as Saviour and as Destroyer,"
5216,SECT. II.,or the apparently miscellaneous character of the attributes which
5217,SECT. II.,"successively attached to him[240]. How strange in itself, that the"
5218,SECT. II.,"God, who alone has a peculiar office in bringing death, should also"
5219,SECT. II.,be the God of deliverance from it! The contradiction is harmonized by
5220,SECT. II.,"the supposition of a traditionary origin, but otherwise it obstinately"
5221,SECT. II.,"remains a contradiction. Again, look at the nature of this peculiar"
5222,SECT. II.,relation. Death by slow disease was not thought worthy to be referred
5223,SECT. II.,"to the agency of a god, (Od. xi. 200.): the calm death of old age, the"
5224,SECT. II.,"sharp and agonizing death of a plague, both these were so, and both"
5225,SECT. II.,"are referred to Apollo. How can this be, and what has become of the"
5226,SECT. II.,"fine imaginative discrimination of the Greeks, and of their love for"
5227,SECT. II.,"logical consistency even in that domain, if we suppose that in all"
5228,SECT. II.,"this they were working by pure fancy? Now the difficulty vanishes, if"
5229,SECT. II.,we suppose them to be the mere utterers of the disjointed fragments of
5230,SECT. II.,"pristine tradition, when they had lost the key to their common meaning."
5231,SECT. II.,"For then, He that was to grind his enemies to powder, was likewise"
5232,SECT. II.,"to take the sting from death itself, and to make the king of terrors"
5233,SECT. II.,"gentle and humane. Again, why was Apollo, thus associated with death,"
5234,SECT. II.,"likewise the god of foreknowledge? Why did he, and he only, partake"
5235,SECT. II.,"of this privilege with Jupiter? Nay, he enjoyed knowledge apparently"
5236,SECT. II.,in a greater degree; for we are not furnished with any case in which
5237,SECT. II.,"Apollo is grossly deluded like Jupiter by Juno. Why, again, should"
5238,SECT. II.,the god of foreknowledge be the god of medicine? And why should the
5239,SECT. II.,"god of medicine also absorb into himself the divinity of the sun,"
5240,SECT. II.,"separate from him in Homer, but afterwards identified with him? Why"
5241,SECT. II.,"does his character, as compared with that of the other gods, approach"
5242,SECT. II.,to purity? As the dignity of Minerva is explained by our supposing
5243,SECT. II.,her to impersonate the ancient traditions of the Wisdom; so in the
5244,SECT. II.,"case of Apollo, we obtain a thread upon which each and all of these"
5245,SECT. II.,"otherwise incongruous notions may be hung, if we suppose that he, after"
5246,SECT. II.,"a certain severance of those shades of character, which could only find"
5247,SECT. II.,"expression for a Greek in the female order, represented the legendary"
5248,SECT. II.,"anticipations of a person to come, in whom should be combined all the"
5249,SECT. II.,"great offices, in which God the Son is now made known to man as the"
5250,SECT. II.,"Light of our paths, the Physician of our diseases, the Judge of our"
5251,SECT. II.,"misdeeds, and the Conqueror and disarmer, but not yet abolisher, of"
5252,SECT. II.,death?
5253,SECT. II.,
5254,SECT. II.,[240] The character of Apollo the Destroyer is well represented in a
5255,SECT. II.,fragment of Archilochus:
5256,SECT. II.,
5257,SECT. II.,"ὤναξ Ἄπολλον, καί συ μὲν τοὺς αἰτίους"

5263,SECT. II.,
5264,SECT. II.,"Again, as these great deities are anomalies in themselves, so are they"
5265,SECT. II.,likewise in the Olympian order.
5266,SECT. II.,
5267,SECT. II.,"If we were to remove Minerva and Apollo from Olympus, we should"
5268,SECT. II.,"indeed take away the breadth and boldness of its sublimity, but we"
5269,SECT. II.,should add greatly to its mere symmetry: especially as some other
5270,SECT. II.,minor figures would for the same reasons follow. There would then
5271,SECT. II.,"remain there the polygamous monarch of the skies, with his chief"
5272,SECT. II.,"and secondary wives, the ranks of earth supplying him from time to"
5273,SECT. II.,time with further satisfaction for his passions; and in his various
5274,SECT. II.,children or companions would be represented the various essential
5275,SECT. II.,"functions, as they were then estimated, of an organized community."
5276,SECT. II.,"Themis would represent policy, Mercury gain, the Muses song, and with"
5277,SECT. II.,"it all knowledge; Vulcan, manual skill; Mars, the soldier; Paieon, the"
5278,SECT. II.,"surgeon; Venus, that relaxed relation of the sexes to which mankind"
5279,SECT. II.,"has ever leaned. For corn there would be Demeter or Ceres, and for"
5280,SECT. II.,"wine, Dionysus or Bacchus. I grant that there is here inserted one"
5281,SECT. II.,single ingredient not known to the Homeric Olympus. His Muses are not
5282,SECT. II.,"stated to have any foreknowledge. But, after allowing for this trifling"
5283,SECT. II.,"exception, I think it remains clear that though the ethics and the"
5284,SECT. II.,poetry of that region would be fatally damaged by the removal of Apollo
5285,SECT. II.,"and Minerva, its mere statistics might be visibly improved."
5286,SECT. II.,
5287,SECT. II.,The discussions which have arisen upon the etymology of the name
5288,SECT. II.,"Apollo, are in themselves significant of the difficulty of accounting"
5289,SECT. II.,for his origin mythologically. Müller mentions the derivation from the
5290,SECT. II.,"sun (Ἠϝέλιος, ΑΠέλιος) in order to reject it; as he repudiates (and"
5291,SECT. II.,"very justly) the whole theory, which treats this deity as an elemental"
5292,SECT. II.,"power. Passing over others as unworthy of serious notice, he rejects"
5293,SECT. II.,"ἀπόλλυμι[241], as ‘founded on a partial and occasional attribute of"
5294,SECT. II.,"the god,’ and adopts ἀπέλλων the _averter_ (_sc._ of evil) or defender,"
5295,SECT. II.,"as most expressive of his general function: in other words, though he"
5296,SECT. II.,"does not go on to say so, he is the darkened shadow of the Saviour. But"

5319,SECT. II.,"an Egyptian name may have been the centre, around which gathered the"

5326,SECT. II.,
5327,SECT. II.,"In quitting a subject of so much importance, I will now endeavour"
5328,SECT. II.,"to sum up, in the most concise form of which it is susceptible, the"
5329,SECT. II.,evidence to be drawn from Homer of the different position held by
5330,SECT. II.,Apollo and Minerva from that of the other Olympian deities.
5331,SECT. II.,
5332,SECT. II.,I. Points of distinction in their relations to the Olympian Court and
5333,SECT. II.,its members.
5334,SECT. II.,
5335,SECT. II.,1. The dignity accorded to them is quite out of keeping with their
5336,SECT. II.,"rank, as belonging to the junior generation of the mythological family,"
5337,SECT. II.,"which was, as such, inferior in rank and power to the senior one[245]."
5338,SECT. II.,
5339,SECT. II.,"[245] See the observation of Neptune, Il. xv. 195-8."
5340,SECT. II.,
5341,SECT. II.,"2. They bear visible marks, even in the mythological order, of an"
5342,SECT. II.,antiquity greater than that of the other deities in general.
5343,SECT. II.,
5344,SECT. II.,"3. The external administration, or subordinate parts of the functions"
5345,SECT. II.,"assigned to them in the mythological system, are commonly devolved upon"
5346,SECT. II.,"another set of deities, here called Secondaries."
5347,SECT. II.,
5348,SECT. II.,"4. A peculiar dignity, in the nature of precedence, is accorded"
5349,SECT. II.,especially to Minerva.
5350,SECT. II.,
5351,SECT. II.,5. We have next noted the singular union of Apollo with Jupiter in
5352,SECT. II.,"will and affection, and the relation of both to him, as the proper and"
5353,SECT. II.,"regular ministers of the supreme dispensations of heaven, apart from"
5354,SECT. II.,the partial and individual action of particular gods.
5355,SECT. II.,
5356,SECT. II.,6. The defence of heaven against rebellion is dimly recorded to have
5357,SECT. II.,been the act of Apollo; and indispensable assistance was also rendered
5358,SECT. II.,on another occasion to Jupiter by Minerva.
5359,SECT. II.,
5360,SECT. II.,"7. These great divinities are never baffled, disgraced, or worsted"
5361,SECT. II.,in any transaction between themselves and any other deity; nor ever
5362,SECT. II.,exhibited by the Poet in a disadvantageous or disparaging position.
5363,SECT. II.,
5364,SECT. II.,II. Points of distinction in their terrestrial relations and their
5365,SECT. II.,conditions of physical existence.
5366,SECT. II.,
5367,SECT. II.,"1. They were known by men to be entitled, either alone, or in common"
5368,SECT. II.,"with Jupiter only, to a peculiar reverence or honour."
5369,SECT. II.,
5370,SECT. II.,2. They were the objects of worship in all parts of the Homeric world.
5371,SECT. II.,
5372,SECT. II.,3. Neither of them are bound to any local residence in particular; and
5373,SECT. II.,for Apollo there is no trace of any such residence at all.
5374,SECT. II.,
5375,SECT. II.,"4. They are both the objects, Minerva more particularly, of general"
5376,SECT. II.,"invocation and prayer, irrespective of place and circumstances."
5377,SECT. II.,
5378,SECT. II.,"5. They are exempted from the chief physical limitations, as of time,"
5379,SECT. II.,"place, and perceptive organs, which are generally imposed upon the"
5380,SECT. II.,deities of invention.
5381,SECT. II.,
5382,SECT. II.,6. They have a separate and independent power to punish those who
5383,SECT. II.,"offend them, without any need of an appeal to Jupiter, or to the"
5384,SECT. II.,Olympian Court.
5385,SECT. II.,
5386,SECT. II.,"7. They are admitted, exclusively, or in common with Juno only, to a"
5387,SECT. II.,share in certain peculiar mythological functions of Jupiter himself.
5388,SECT. II.,
5389,SECT. II.,"8. They have a power of making revelations to men, through signs or"
5390,SECT. II.,portents significant of the future.
5391,SECT. II.,
5392,SECT. II.,9. They have a general power of extraordinary or miraculous action upon
5393,SECT. II.,"nature, to which scarcely any other deity approaches."
5394,SECT. II.,
5395,SECT. II.,"10. The peculiar and mysterious relation of Apollo, with his"
5396,SECT. II.,"sister Diana, to death, cannot be understood or accounted for from"
5397,SECT. II.,mythological _data_.
5398,SECT. II.,
5399,SECT. II.,"11. In the exercise of their power over nature, Minerva and Apollo are,"
5400,SECT. II.,"more than other deities, exempt from the need of resort to symbolic"
5401,SECT. II.,actions by way of cooperative means.
5402,SECT. II.,
5403,SECT. II.,III. Points of distinction with regard to their personal characters.
5404,SECT. II.,
5405,SECT. II.,1. Their moral tone is far superior to that of the Olympian Court in
5406,SECT. II.,general.
5407,SECT. II.,
5408,SECT. II.,2. They are both peculiarly associated with Jupiter in the original
5409,SECT. II.,"administration of Providential functions, and are particularly"
5410,SECT. II.,"concerned with the highest, most ethical, and most inward parts of"
5411,SECT. II.,them.
5412,SECT. II.,
5413,SECT. II.,3. Their relation to their mythological attributes is different in kind
5414,SECT. II.,from that of the ordinary Olympian divinities.
5415,SECT. II.,
5416,SECT. II.,4. They have a number and range of attributes quite without parallel in
5417,SECT. II.,the Olympian system: and yet with this a capacity of receiving new ones.
5418,SECT. II.,
5419,SECT. II.,"5. Both in themselves, and in reference to that system, the whole"
5420,SECT. II.,"conception of Apollo and Minerva, if it be viewed mythologically, is"
5421,SECT. II.,full of inexplicable anomaly: and the only solution to be found is
5422,SECT. II.,"in the recognition of the traditional basis, on which the Homeric"
5423,SECT. II.,representations of them must be founded.
5424,SECT. II.,
5425,SECT. II.,Although what I have built upon this evidence may be termed an
5426,SECT. II.,"hypothesis, the whole of the evidence itself is circumstantial: and"
5427,SECT. II.,"I feel that the effect of it is not only to draw a broad line, but"
5428,SECT. II.,"almost to place an impassable gulf, between such divinities as the"
5429,SECT. II.,"Homeric Minerva and Apollo, on the one hand, and the Homeric Mars,"
5430,SECT. II.,"Venus, Vulcan, and Mercury on the other. The differences between"
5431,SECT. II.,"them are, however, graduated and shaded off by the interposition,"
5432,SECT. II.,"first, of the minor traditive deities, such as Latona and Diana; and,"
5433,SECT. II.,"secondly, of the greatest among the Olympian personages chiefly or"
5434,SECT. II.,"wholly mythological, such as Neptune and Juno: and it is probably this"
5435,SECT. II.,"graduation, running through the Olympian body, which has prevented our"
5436,SECT. II.,duly appreciating the immense interval that lies between its extremes.
5437,SECT. II.,
5438,SECT. II.,"It is to the indefatigable students of Germany that we, the less"
5439,SECT. II.,"laborious English, are, along with the rest of the world, indebted"
5440,SECT. II.,for what may be called the systematic treatment of the Homeric poems
5441,SECT. II.,with respect to the facts they contain. To amass evidence is one
5442,SECT. II.,"thing; to penetrate into its heart and spirit, is another. The former"
5443,SECT. II.,without the latter is insufficient; but the former is to the latter an
5444,SECT. II.,"indispensable preliminary. The works of Homer should be viewed, and"
5445,SECT. II.,"their testimony registered, like the phenomena of a geological period:"
5446,SECT. II.,"so unencumbered is he with speculation or the bias of opinion; so true,"
5447,SECT. II.,"clear, direct, and unmixed is his exhibition of historical and moral"
5448,SECT. II.,"fact. This method of investigation, honestly pursued, carries with it"
5449,SECT. II.,an adequate and a self-acting provision for the correction of its own
5450,SECT. II.,errors.

5453,SECT. II.,
5454,SECT. II.,"Since I commenced the examination of the question now before us, there"

5456,SECT. II.,"latest compendium of what may be called the facts of the Homeric poems,"
5457,SECT. II.,by J. B. Friedreich. I find that this writer has been struck by the
5458,SECT. II.,overpowering evidence of the vestiges of an early revelation in the
5459,SECT. II.,characters of the Homeric Minerva and Apollo[246]. He observes the
5460,SECT. II.,separate character of their relations both to Jupiter and to mankind;
5461,SECT. II.,assigns to them an unbounded power over all events and the whole of
5462,SECT. II.,"human life; and says, ‘This Triad of Zeus, Athene, and Apollo, bears"
5463,SECT. II.,"an unmistakeable analogy to the Christian Trinity, of Father, Holy"
5464,SECT. II.,"Ghost, and Son: Jupiter answering to God the Father, Athene to the"
5465,SECT. II.,"Holy Ghost, and Apollo to the Son of God, the Declarer of the will of"
5466,SECT. II.,"His Heavenly Father: like as, furthermore, the early Christians have"
5467,SECT. II.,largely compared Christ with Apollo.’

5474,SECT. II.,
5475,SECT. II.,In this representation I find a fundamental agreement with the
5476,SECT. II.,views expressed in the present work. But I venture to think that
5477,SECT. II.,the particular mode of the relation between the Homeric and the
5478,SECT. II.,"primitive tradition, which has been set forth in this work, is more"
5479,SECT. II.,natural and probable than that asserted by Friedreich. As it has
5480,SECT. II.,"been here represented, we are to consider the primitive tradition as"
5481,SECT. II.,"disintegrated and subdivided. First, that of the Redeemer is severed"
5482,SECT. II.,"from that of the Holy Trinity. Next, its two aspects of the Wisdom and"
5483,SECT. II.,"the Messiah, become two impersonations. And then the impersonation"
5484,SECT. II.,"which represents the tradition properly Messianic, is itself again"
5485,SECT. II.,"subjected to duplication. As the result of this threefold operation, we"
5486,SECT. II.,have--
5487,SECT. II.,
5488,SECT. II.,1. The trine Kronid brotherhood.
5489,SECT. II.,
5490,SECT. II.,2. Minerva and Apollo.
5491,SECT. II.,
5492,SECT. II.,3. Apollo and Diana.
5493,SECT. II.,
5494,SECT. II.,"The principle of the severance always being, to get rid of some"
5495,SECT. II.,"difficulty, encountered by the human apprehension in embracing the"
5496,SECT. II.,integral tradition.
5497,SECT. II.,
5498,SECT. II.,"The difficulty at the first step was to reconcile equality, or what"
5499,SECT. II.,"the Christian dogma more profoundly terms consubstantiality, with a"
5500,SECT. II.,ministerial manifestation.
5501,SECT. II.,
5502,SECT. II.,The difficulty at the second step probably was to combine in one
5503,SECT. II.,"impersonation two groups of images, the one (the Wisdom), relating to"
5504,SECT. II.,"function that dwells purely in the Godhead; the other, to function"
5505,SECT. II.,"containing the element of humanity; it was, in short, to grasp the"
5506,SECT. II.,"doctrine, ‘One altogether; not by confusion of Substance, but by unity"
5507,SECT. II.,of Person.’
5508,SECT. II.,
5509,SECT. II.,"The difficulty at the third step apparently was, as has been stated,"
5510,SECT. II.,to associate the ideal of a strict and severe chastity with any but a
5511,SECT. II.,female nature.
5512,SECT. II.,
5513,SECT. II.,"There is no question now before us as to Apollo: the point at issue is,"
5514,SECT. II.,"whether we are to regard the Athene, or Minerva, of Homer as derived"
5515,SECT. II.,"from traditions of the Logos, or from traditions of the Holy Spirit."
5516,SECT. II.,
5517,SECT. II.,"I urge the former, for the following reasons:"
5518,SECT. II.,
5519,SECT. II.,1. Setting aside what was involved in the doctrine of a Trinity
5520,SECT. II.,"(which is otherwise represented), we have no evidence that there"
5521,SECT. II.,was any such substantive body of primitive tradition respecting the
5522,SECT. II.,"Holy Spirit, as would be likely to form the nucleus of a separate"
5523,SECT. II.,"mythological impersonation, and especially of one endowed with such"
5524,SECT. II.,"comprehensiveness, solidity, and activity of function as Minerva."
5525,SECT. II.,Whereas it appears that there was that kind of substantive tradition
5526,SECT. II.,"with respect to the Λόγος, the Word or Wisdom of God."
5527,SECT. II.,
5528,SECT. II.,"2. In the order of primitive tradition, the Son of God would precede"
5529,SECT. II.,"the Holy Spirit, as is the case in the order of the Christian dogma;"
5530,SECT. II.,"and the fragments of such tradition, when carried into mythology, would"
5531,SECT. II.,"preserve and probably exaggerate, at any rate would not invert, the"
5532,SECT. II.,"relation. But in the Homeric mythology, Minerva has a decided practical"
5533,SECT. II.,"precedence over Apollo, and above all, when they come into collision,"
5534,SECT. II.,"it is Apollo that yields, as in the incidents of the Seventh and Tenth"
5535,SECT. II.,"Iliads, and in the general issue of the Trojan war."
5536,SECT. II.,
5537,SECT. II.,"3. But this difference is just what might be expected to follow, upon"
5538,SECT. II.,the natural divergence of the two traditions of the Word and the
5539,SECT. II.,"Incarnate Messiah respectively. The latter, as more human, would take"
5540,SECT. II.,rank after the former as more Divine.
5541,SECT. II.,
5542,SECT. II.,4. We have also found a greater tendency on the part of Minerva to
5543,SECT. II.,act independently of Jupiter. This is no unnatural diversion from the
5544,SECT. II.,"tradition of the Λόγος, but it would be hard to connect ideally with"
5545,SECT. II.,"the Holy Spirit, who has not, in the ancient tradition, the same amount"
5546,SECT. II.,or kind of separate development as the Messiah.
5547,SECT. II.,
5548,SECT. II.,~_Müller’s treatment of Apollo._~
5549,SECT. II.,
5550,SECT. II.,"The functions of Apollo, and the nature, extent, and history of his"
5551,SECT. II.,"worship have been investigated at great length by Müller, in the Second"
5552,SECT. II.,Book of his learned and able History and Antiquities of the Doric race.
5553,SECT. II.,He has shown the immense importance of this deity in Greek history
5554,SECT. II.,"and religion, reaching every where, and embracing every object and"
5555,SECT. II.,purpose. He recognises the apparent antagonism subsisting among his
5556,SECT. II.,"infinitely varied functions; which he makes elaborate and ingenious,"
5557,SECT. II.,"but I think necessarily insufficient, efforts to trace ideally to an"
5558,SECT. II.,"union of origin within the mythological system. His hypothesis, that"
5559,SECT. II.,"the worship of Apollo was wholly due to Dorian influence, requires the"
5560,SECT. II.,"support of the most violently strained assumptions; as for example,"
5561,SECT. II.,"that its prevalence, apparently at all points, in Troas is to be"
5562,SECT. II.,"accounted for by Cretan influences there, which, at the most, tradition"
5563,SECT. II.,would only warrant us in believing to have existed in a very contracted
5564,SECT. II.,"form, and with influence altogether secondary. Altogether, this sheer"
5565,SECT. II.,Dorianism of Apollo is at variance with the whole spirit and effect
5566,SECT. II.,of the Homeric testimony; for in Homer the Dorians are insignificant
5567,SECT. II.,"and undeveloped, while the power and worship of Apollo had attained,"
5568,SECT. II.,"as we have seen, to an extraordinary height, and to the very broadest"
5569,SECT. II.,"range. Again, Müller[247] acknowledges the great difficulty of the"
5570,SECT. II.,"dualism presented to us by the figures, concurring as they do in such"
5571,SECT. II.,"remarkable functions, of Apollo and Diana: a difficulty, which he seems"
5572,SECT. II.,to think incapable of full explanation. While attaching great value
5573,SECT. II.,"to his treatise, I have the less hesitation in adopting conclusions"
5574,SECT. II.,"that he does not authorize, because his work is based in some degree"
5575,SECT. II.,upon that (as I presume to think) defective mode of appreciation of the
5576,SECT. II.,"Homeric as compared with the later traditions, against which I have"
5577,SECT. II.,"ventured to protest, and from the consequences of which it is one of my"
5578,SECT. II.,main objects to effect at least a partial escape.
5579,SECT. II.,
5580,SECT. II.,[247] B. II. ch. ix. 2. and 9.
5581,SECT. II.,
5582,SECT. II.,It will have appeared from this general account of the traditive
5583,SECT. II.,"characters of Apollo and Minerva, that the former represented the"
5584,SECT. II.,"tradition of a person, and the latter of an idea. Accordingly, the"
5585,SECT. II.,"original character of Apollo, which he bore during the infancy of the"
5586,SECT. II.,"mythical system, is in many points the more significantly marked;"
5587,SECT. II.,"as for example, by his share in the War with the Giants, and by his"
5588,SECT. II.,mysterious relation to Death.
5589,SECT. II.,
5590,SECT. II.,"But it was natural that, in the course of time, as tradition in general"
5591,SECT. II.,"grew weaker with the increasing distance from its source, and as the"
5592,SECT. II.,"inventive system enlarged its development, those particular traditions,"
5593,SECT. II.,"which were self-explained by having their root in an intelligible idea,"
5594,SECT. II.,should hold their ground much better than such as had become mythical
5595,SECT. II.,and arbitrary by having lost their key. The traditional Minerva had an
5596,SECT. II.,anchorage in the great function of Wisdom; the traditional Apollo had
5597,SECT. II.,"no support equal to this in breadth and depth; and his attributes, the"
5598,SECT. II.,"band of revelation being removed, lost their harmony and could ill be"
5599,SECT. II.,held together.
5600,SECT. II.,
5601,SECT. II.,Accordingly we find that in the later ages of the mythology Apollo had
5602,SECT. II.,"lost much of what was transcendant in his importance, but that Minerva"
5603,SECT. II.,retained her full rank. One and the same Ode of Horace supplies the
5604,SECT. II.,"proof of both. He places Apollo on a level not only with Diana, but"
5605,SECT. II.,with Bacchus[248]:
5606,SECT. II.,
5607,SECT. II.,[248] Hor. Od. I. xii. 21.

5612,SECT. II.,"Phœbe, sagittâ."
5613,SECT. II.,
5614,SECT. II.,"But, after having described the supreme and transcendant dignity of"
5615,SECT. II.,"Jupiter, he at once proceeds to place Pallas before every other deity"
5616,SECT. II.,without exception[249]:

5633,SECT. II.,"Like the Moon to the Sun, an analogy maintained by their respective"

5636,SECT. II.,
5637,SECT. II.,"She was worshipped, says Müller[250], in the character of ‘as it were a"
5638,SECT. II.,"part of the same deity.’ He collects and reviews, from the whole circle"

5640,SECT. II.,"and notices particularly, that like him she is both λυκεία and οὐλία,"
5641,SECT. II.,both the destroyer and the preserver; that she administers her office
5642,SECT. II.,"as angel of Death, sometimes in wrath and sometimes without it; and"
5643,SECT. II.,"that her name Artemis, meaning, as he conceives, healthy and uninjured,"
5644,SECT. II.,is in close correspondence with those of Phœbus Apollo.

5655,SECT. II.,"high purity, and the double aspect of the ministry of Death, appear"
5656,SECT. II.,to be of themselves sufficient to stamp her beyond mistake with a
5657,SECT. II.,"traditionary origin. Small resemblances, too, as well as great ones,"
5658,SECT. II.,"are traceable in Homer between her and Apollo, such as her golden"
5659,SECT. II.,"throne and golden distaff, which may be compared to his golden sword,"
5660,SECT. II.,the sword of primeval light: and even these minor correspondences may
5661,SECT. II.,in their own degree bear witness to the original and integral shape of
5662,SECT. II.,the tradition.
5663,SECT. II.,
5664,SECT. II.,"If she is thus clothed in a sort of lunar light, and is in the main"
5665,SECT. II.,"a reflection of Apollo upon earth, such we may probably consider"
5666,SECT. II.,Persephone in the Shades[251].
5667,SECT. II.,
5668,SECT. II.,[251] See ‘Persephone’ in section iii.
5669,SECT. II.,
5670,SECT. II.,"Let us, however, consider what can be gathered from Homer as to the"
5671,SECT. II.,attributes of Diana.
5672,SECT. II.,
5673,SECT. II.,"This deity would appear to have been, according to him, a deity"
5674,SECT. II.,of universal worship. We may perhaps safely infer thus much from
5675,SECT. II.,the single fact of her ministry of Death. She is also represented
5676,SECT. II.,"as extending her agency to Troy, where she taught Scamandrius to"
5677,SECT. II.,"hunt[252]; probably to Crete, in the case of the daughters of"
5678,SECT. II.,"Pandareos; she is invoked in Ithaca by Penelope, puts Ariadne to death"
5679,SECT. II.,"in Dia, exercises a similar function for the women in Συρίη, sends the"
5680,SECT. II.,"Calydonian boar for a defect of homage in Ætolia, and is familiarly"
5681,SECT. II.,"mentioned in connection with the Greeks generally, while her place in"
5682,SECT. II.,the Theomachy may suffice to mark her as also a Pelasgian goddess.
5683,SECT. II.,"In most points, however, she partakes largely, as might be expected,"
5684,SECT. II.,of the characteristics of the ordinary deities of invention. Had she
5685,SECT. II.,"repeated all the chief notes of Apollo, and with any thing like an"
5686,SECT. II.,"equal force, the question of traditional origin would perhaps have been"
5687,SECT. II.,more doubtful than it now is.

5690,SECT. II.,
5691,SECT. II.,"When she is invoked by Penelope, it is in connection with her share of"
5692,SECT. II.,the special ministry of death[253]. She is nowhere else made the object
5693,SECT. II.,of prayer.
5694,SECT. II.,
5695,SECT. II.,[253] Od. xx. 61.
5696,SECT. II.,
5697,SECT. II.,It is her deep resentment at the omission of sacrifice which provokes
5698,SECT. II.,"her to send the Calydonian boar[254]. In the Fifth Iliad, she and"
5699,SECT. II.,her mother Latona appear as deities purely subsidiary to Apollo. He
5700,SECT. II.,"deposits Æneas in his temple: there, not in a temple of their own,"
5701,SECT. II.,Latona and Diana attend upon and heal him[255].

5706,SECT. II.,
5707,SECT. II.,"In the Theomachy, she is treated with the same ignominy as Mars and"
5708,SECT. II.,"Venus, but by Juno instead of Minerva. Her railing address to Apollo is"
5709,SECT. II.,conceived in the lower and not in the higher spirit (Il. xxi. 472-7).
5710,SECT. II.,
5711,SECT. II.,"She never assumes a general power, either over man in mind or body, or"
5712,SECT. II.,over outward nature.
5713,SECT. II.,
5714,SECT. II.,"She has no share in the general movement of either poem, and is"
5715,SECT. II.,introduced in the great majority of instances by way of allusion only.
5716,SECT. II.,
5717,SECT. II.,Her near relation to Apollo gives a certain grandeur to her position:
5718,SECT. II.,but the inventive elements of the representation greatly obscure and
5719,SECT. II.,even partially overbear the traditional.
5720,SECT. II.,
5721,SECT. II.,Her side in the Trojan war is to be explained by her relation to
5722,SECT. II.,Apollo. In all other points she seems to be a goddess of associations
5723,SECT. II.,"more properly Greek, perhaps in consequence of their greater addiction"
5724,SECT. II.,to hunting.
5725,SECT. II.,
5726,SECT. II.,In treating the Homeric Diana as a personage principally ancillary
5727,SECT. II.,"to Apollo, and equipped with reflections, or stray fragments, of"
5728,SECT. II.,"prerogatives chiefly belonging to him, I do not attempt to foreclose"
5729,SECT. II.,"the question what may have been the origin of her name, or whether she"
5730,SECT. II.,may be connected with any mythological original in the religions of the
5731,SECT. II.,East or of Egypt.

5733,SECT. II.,"Döllinger conceives that the union of Diana with Apollo was Greek,"
5734,SECT. II.,and that they were not originally in relation with one another;
5735,SECT. II.,"while he justly observes, that this deity, like Apollo, has a great"
5736,SECT. II.,"and inexplicable diversity of function. She, like other deities of"
5737,SECT. II.,"Greece, has been thought to represent the Astarte of the Syrians."
5738,SECT. II.,"Again, Herodotus[256] has given us most curious information respecting"
5739,SECT. II.,"the gods of the Scythians, whom we have found to be related to the"
5740,SECT. II.,"Pelasgi. They worship, he states, the Celestial Venus under the name"
5741,SECT. II.,"of Artimpasa. This name, it has been ingeniously conjectured[257], is"
5742,SECT. II.,"composed (1) of the name Mitra, which the Persians gave to Venus[258],"
5743,SECT. II.,"and which reversed becomes Artim, and (2) of the Sanscrit _Bhas_,"
5744,SECT. II.,"meaning _shine_, and thus corresponding with the Φοῖβος of Apollo,"
5745,SECT. II.,"and the Γλαυκῶπις of Pallas: all of them being, as it were, shreds of"
5746,SECT. II.,"the tradition fully represented in the Shechinah of the Jews, and the"
5747,SECT. II.,‘Light’ of Saint John. This also corresponds with the cluster of golden
5748,SECT. II.,"epithets, the χρυσηλάκατος, χρυσήνιος, and χρυσόθρονος, which Homer"
5749,SECT. II.,applies to Diana: and the very feebleness of Diana in the Theomachy
5750,SECT. II.,"suggests that the Eastern prototype of Venus, the Mitra of the"
5751,SECT. II.,"Persians, was originally no more than a degenerate derivation from a"
5752,SECT. II.,"higher tradition, which found a more natural, but still only a partial,"

5764,SECT. II.,of Apollo and of Diana.
5765,SECT. II.,
5766,SECT. II.,"It is scarcely possible to avoid being struck, on turning to this"
5767,SECT. II.,"portraiture, with the contrast between the slightness of the outline"
5768,SECT. II.,"and the real dignity of the features and position. This contrast,"
5769,SECT. II.,"like the greater one relating to Apollo, seems to have its key in the"
5770,SECT. II.,traditional origin of the representation: and there is no one Homeric
5771,SECT. II.,"deity, whose case, when fully considered, can afford a more marked"
5772,SECT. II.,testimony to the hypothesis of a strong element of traditive theology
5773,SECT. II.,in the religious system of the Poems.
5774,SECT. II.,
5775,SECT. II.,Why has she a position so different from that of any other wife or
5776,SECT. II.,"concubine of Jupiter: such, for example, as Dione or Demeter?"
5777,SECT. II.,
5778,SECT. II.,"Why is it so much elevated above that of any among them, except only"
5779,SECT. II.,Juno?
5780,SECT. II.,
5781,SECT. II.,"How comes she to have a son so incomparably superior in rank, in power,"
5782,SECT. II.,"and in the affections of his father, to any child of Juno herself, the"
5783,SECT. II.,πρεσβὰ θεά?
5784,SECT. II.,
5785,SECT. II.,"Why, being thus great, is she wholly unfurnished with attributes or"
5786,SECT. II.,"functions, either general or specific?"
5787,SECT. II.,
5788,SECT. II.,"Why, on the other hand, does so much obscurity hang about her origin,"
5789,SECT. II.,"and what are we to say as to her divinity, in answer to the question,"
5790,SECT. II.,whether it was original or acquired?
5791,SECT. II.,
5792,SECT. II.,The name of Latona appears to have been a perpetual puzzle to the
5793,SECT. II.,"expounders of Greek mythology. It is taken to mean Night, which,"
5794,SECT. II.,"combined with Day, produces the Sun[259]; or ‘obscure,’ or ‘concealed,’"
5795,SECT. II.,"as that from which issues the visible deity, the Sun in heaven."
5796,SECT. II.,But surely these explanations can have no bearing upon the Homeric
5797,SECT. II.,"mythology, where it is matter of question even whether Apollo and the"
5798,SECT. II.,"Sun have any mutual relations at all, and where it is quite clear"
5799,SECT. II.,"that the personality of Apollo is far older and riper, as well as far"
5800,SECT. II.,"higher and more comprehensive; which implies of necessity, that Latona"
5801,SECT. II.,"must have been known, and must have held her place, quite apart from"
5802,SECT. II.,any relation to the Sun. An explanation of this kind is simply an
5803,SECT. II.,"indication, that the problem has not yet been solved."
5804,SECT. II.,
5805,SECT. II.,[259] Döllinger Heid. u. Jud. p. 71. Smith’s Dict. art. Leto.
5806,SECT. II.,
5807,SECT. II.,"But now, if we presume Apollo to be the representative of the Messianic"
5808,SECT. II.,"tradition, that the Seed of the woman should crush the serpent’s head,"
5809,SECT. II.,the state of the case is entirely changed. And the explanation of
5810,SECT. II.,"the name in particular, instead of being hopeless, becomes easy, and"
5811,SECT. II.,even auxiliary to the general hypothesis. For now Latona stands in
5812,SECT. II.,the tradition as a person anterior to the whole Olympian mythology:
5813,SECT. II.,a person for whose extraction that mythology does not and ought not
5814,SECT. II.,"to account. Its Jupiter and Juno are referred to a parentage, that of"
5815,SECT. II.,"Κρόνος and Ῥέα, and through these perhaps afresh to Oceanus and Tethys"
5816,SECT. II.,"as their ultimate source. Everything, again, that is connected with the"
5817,SECT. II.,"genesis of the Olympian system, properly so called, is made to conform"
5818,SECT. II.,"to anthropomorphous ideas: but here are two of its deities, one of"
5819,SECT. II.,"them among its very greatest, who have a mother that forms part of the"
5820,SECT. II.,"earliest known tradition respecting them, while that mother is herself"
5821,SECT. II.,"without an origin. What could be more natural, than that a name should"
5822,SECT. II.,"fasten itself upon her, simply importing that, illustrious as was her"
5823,SECT. II.,"motherhood, the fountain-head of her own life and destiny was lost in"
5824,SECT. II.,oblivion? For it lay beyond the point from which all mythical knowledge
5825,SECT. II.,"was held to spring. A certain motherhood was known of her, and that was"
5826,SECT. II.,all.
5827,SECT. II.,
5828,SECT. II.,"Again, the mother of the Deliverer was to be a woman. But in the"
5829,SECT. II.,"Greek mythology it could not be, that a woman should stand as the"
5830,SECT. II.,giver of life to one of its most august divinities. Yet the woman
5831,SECT. II.,of the tradition could not be transferred from the tradition as a
5832,SECT. II.,"great substantive personage into the Greek mythology, because in the"
5833,SECT. II.,"tradition she stood an unembellished figure, wholly without attributes."
5834,SECT. II.,"Hence invention would, on taking over the tradition, be at fault; and"
5835,SECT. II.,"could not but present to us an ambiguous and inconsistent picture, such"
5836,SECT. II.,as now stands before us in the Latona of Homer.
5837,SECT. II.,
5838,SECT. II.,"Let us next set forth the facts regarding Latona, as they stand in the"
5839,SECT. II.,poems.
5840,SECT. II.,
5841,SECT. II.,"In the first place, then, her divinity is beyond all doubt; for she is"
5842,SECT. II.,"one of those deities who take part in the war[260], and this although,"
5843,SECT. II.,"almost alone among them, she has no office whatever to associate"
5844,SECT. II.,"her with it, and no part to play in the conduct of it. She ranges"
5845,SECT. II.,"herself on the side of the Trojans; apparently, like Diana, drawn in"
5846,SECT. II.,"that direction by Apollo, the central and really important figure"
5847,SECT. II.,"of the group. While Venus, who appears in the first enumeration, is"
5848,SECT. II.,"omitted in the array[261] of deities for action, Latona has Mercury"
5849,SECT. II.,"assigned to her for an antagonist. And, when the crisis comes, we"
5850,SECT. II.,"observe in her case a marked instance of that care, with which Homer"
5851,SECT. II.,"preserves her, like the greater traditive deities, from anything like"
5852,SECT. II.,"discredit. Mercury declines the combat, on the ground that it is"
5853,SECT. II.,hard to fight against the wives of Jupiter; and tells her she is at
5854,SECT. II.,liberty to announce that she has vanquished him. Whence has this pale
5855,SECT. II.,and colourless figure such very high honour so jealously asserted for
5856,SECT. II.,her[262]?
5857,SECT. II.,
5858,SECT. II.,[260] Il. xx. 40.
5859,SECT. II.,
5860,SECT. II.,[261] Ibid. 72.
5861,SECT. II.,
5862,SECT. II.,[262] Il. xx. 497-501.
5863,SECT. II.,
5864,SECT. II.,"When Niobe, proud of her numerous offspring, taunts Latona as the"
5865,SECT. II.,"mother of only two children, summary and awful punishment follows: the"
5866,SECT. II.,"children are slain, the unhappy mother is turned to stone. Yet she"
5867,SECT. II.,"herself takes no part in the vengeance, a fact remarkably in harmony"
5868,SECT. II.,with her place as defined by the primitive tradition of Holy Scripture.
5869,SECT. II.,"Of the three or four suffering figures in the Shades, only one has the"
5870,SECT. II.,"cause of his punishment stated, and it is much the severest of all. It"
5871,SECT. II.,"is Tityus, whose entrails are continually devoured by vultures, because"
5872,SECT. II.,he offered violence to Latona as she was going to the Pythian temple of
5873,SECT. II.,her son.
5874,SECT. II.,
5875,SECT. II.,"When, in the Fourteenth Iliad, Jupiter recites the mothers of certain"
5876,SECT. II.,"of his offspring, beginning with women and ending with goddesses,"
5877,SECT. II.,"Latona appears in the latter category, after Ceres and before Juno:"
5878,SECT. II.,"and, as the scale is an ascending one, she must clearly rank before the"
5879,SECT. II.,first and next to the last named deity.
5880,SECT. II.,
5881,SECT. II.,"There are, however, various indications that this had not always been"
5882,SECT. II.,"so: but that, according to original tradition, she had been of the"
5883,SECT. II.,"human order, and had undergone a sort of translation into the ranks of"
5884,SECT. II.,the Immortals.
5885,SECT. II.,
5886,SECT. II.,The first of these is the taunt of Niobe. The boast of richer
5887,SECT. II.,"fecundity is natural in a human mother’s mouth, as against another"
5888,SECT. II.,"mother reputed to be human[263]; but entirely strange and absurd, if"
5889,SECT. II.,we suppose it directed against a deity. Dione and Demeter have but one
5890,SECT. II.,child each. Nor is there a marked difference in this respect between
5891,SECT. II.,"the Latona and the Juno of Homer; for Juno’s children are but two, or"
5892,SECT. II.,at most three[264].
5893,SECT. II.,
5894,SECT. II.,[263] Il. xxiv. 608.
5895,SECT. II.,
5896,SECT. II.,"[264] I do not reckon the Εἰλιθυῖαι, who appear to be purely poetical"
5897,SECT. II.,"and figurative daughters of Juno, like the Muses of Jupiter; and as"
5898,SECT. II.,Terror is the son of Mars. Il. xi. 270. 1. ii. 491. xiii. 299.
5899,SECT. II.,
5900,SECT. II.,"Next, we can account for the origin and parentage of all the great"
5901,SECT. II.,"Olympian deities of Homer, with the single exception of Latona. She"
5902,SECT. II.,"is no one’s daughter, no one’s sister: but is a wife (that also"
5903,SECT. II.,"equivocally), and a mother only. When, indeed, we part company with"
5904,SECT. II.,"Homer, the scene changes, and a father is found for her in the Hymns:"
5905,SECT. II.,"she is the daughter, according to one reading, of Saturn,"
5906,SECT. II.,
5907,SECT. II.,κυδίστη θύγατερ μεγάλοιο Κρόνοιο[265].
5908,SECT. II.,
5909,SECT. II.,[265] Hymn. ad Apoll. 62.
5910,SECT. II.,
5911,SECT. II.,In Hesiod she is the daughter of a Titan: but even here she retains
5912,SECT. II.,"this mark of a most ancient tradition, that she is said to have been"
5913,SECT. II.,married to Jupiter before the great Juno[266]: though she comes after
5914,SECT. II.,"Metis, or Wisdom, the oldest of all his consorts; an order not at"
5915,SECT. II.,variance with the traditional ideas.
5916,SECT. II.,

5918,SECT. II.,
5919,SECT. II.,~_Her anomalous position in mythology._~
5920,SECT. II.,
5921,SECT. II.,But there must have been some cause or process that brought her into
5922,SECT. II.,"the Homeric Olympus, an anomaly alike among mortals and Immortals. What"
5923,SECT. II.,"could it have been, except an illustrious maternity, to account for her"
5924,SECT. II.,"elevation, and at the same time her original womanhood to account for"
5925,SECT. II.,"the blank in the descent and consanguinity, and for her total want of"
5926,SECT. II.,attributes?
5927,SECT. II.,
5928,SECT. II.,It must be granted that there is a certain degree of resemblance
5929,SECT. II.,"between Latona and Dione: turning mainly upon this, that Dione seems"
5930,SECT. II.,"to be in Olympus without either dignity or power, and simply as the"
5931,SECT. II.,"vehicle, through which her daughter Venus was brought into existence."
5932,SECT. II.,But then the want of basis is in her case immediately made evident by
5933,SECT. II.,results. Even in Homer she is not among the gods of the Theomachy; nor
5934,SECT. II.,"is she named among the mothers in the Fourteenth Book; and Hesiod,"
5935,SECT. II.,"though she is invoked in the suspected Proem of his Theogony, entirely"
5936,SECT. II.,"passes her over in the body of it, and furnishes Venus with another"
5937,SECT. II.,origin. She remains all but a cipher ever after.
5938,SECT. II.,
5939,SECT. II.,"Again, the epithets attached to Latona are such as to leave her, and"
5940,SECT. II.,"her alone among all deities of such dignity, wholly functionless, and"
5941,SECT. II.,"also wholly inactive. I distinguish the two, because Juno has only a"
5942,SECT. II.,"limited function, but she has power, and an immense activity. Latona"
5943,SECT. II.,"has beauty and majesty, qualities which appertain to every goddess as"
5944,SECT. II.,"such: she is καλλιπάρῃος, εὐπλόκαμος, καλλιπλόκαμος, χρυσοπλόκαμος,"
5945,SECT. II.,"ἠΰκομος, κυδρὴ, πότνια, and ἐρικύδης: and we may observe in the more"
5946,SECT. II.,"personal portion of these epithets how Homer, with his usual skill, has"
5947,SECT. II.,"avoided placing her in any kind of rivalry with Juno, who is usually"
5948,SECT. II.,"praised for her eyes and arms, not her cheeks and hair. But they all"
5949,SECT. II.,"leave her void of purpose; and she must stand as a sheer anomaly,"
5950,SECT. II.,unless there is some better explanation of her being and place in
5951,SECT. II.,"mythology, than mythology itself can supply."
5952,SECT. II.,
5953,SECT. II.,~_Her relation to primitive Tradition._~
5954,SECT. II.,
5955,SECT. II.,"Even in the later tradition, Latona never gains a definite office: she"
5956,SECT. II.,remains all along without any meaning or purpose intrinsic to herself:
5957,SECT. II.,"she shines only in the reflected glory of her offspring, and is"
5958,SECT. II.,commonly worshipped only in union with them[267]. If therefore it has
5959,SECT. II.,"been shown, that the mythological character of Apollo is clearly the"
5960,SECT. II.,"vehicle of the ancient tradition, known to us in the Book of Genesis,"
5961,SECT. II.,"respecting the Seed of the woman, it seems plain that in Latona is"
5962,SECT. II.,represented the woman from whom that Seed was to spring.
5963,SECT. II.,
5964,SECT. II.,"[267] Smith’s Dict., art. Leto."
5965,SECT. II.,
5966,SECT. II.,I do not presume to enter into the question whether we ought to
5967,SECT. II.,"consider that the Latona of Homer represents the Blessed Virgin, who"
5968,SECT. II.,was divinely elected to be the actual mother of our Lord; or rather our
5969,SECT. II.,"ancient mother Eve, whose seed He was also in a peculiar sense to be."
5970,SECT. II.,
5971,SECT. II.,"So far as personal application is concerned, the same arguments might"
5972,SECT. II.,"be used upon the subject, as upon the interpretation of the original"
5973,SECT. II.,promise recorded in Scripture: and the question is one rather of the
5974,SECT. II.,"interpretation of Scripture, than of Homer. The relation which appears"
5975,SECT. II.,"to me to be proved from the text of the poems, is between the deity"
5976,SECT. II.,called Latona and the fifteenth verse of the third chapter of Genesis.
5977,SECT. II.,"As to all beyond this, I should suppose it perhaps more just to regard"
5978,SECT. II.,"her as a typical person, exhibiting through womanhood the truth of"
5979,SECT. II.,"our Blessed Lord’s humanity, than as the mere representative of any"
5980,SECT. II.,individual personage.
5981,SECT. II.,
5982,SECT. II.,Backward as is the position of Latona in the practical religion
5983,SECT. II.,"of Homer, the universal recognition of the deity is sufficiently"
5984,SECT. II.,established: on the one hand by her place among the deities of the
5985,SECT. II.,"Trojan party; on the other, by the punishment of Niobe for an offence"
5986,SECT. II.,"against her either in Greece, or at the least in a recognised Greek"
5987,SECT. II.,legend; by the punishment of Tityus; and by her inclusion in the
5988,SECT. II.,Catalogue of the Fourteenth Iliad.
5989,SECT. II.,
5990,SECT. II.,~_Her slightness of action._~
5991,SECT. II.,
5992,SECT. II.,To this very remarkable deity no utterance of any kind is ever ascribed
5993,SECT. II.,"by Homer, and with, I think, three small exceptions, nothing of"
5994,SECT. II.,personal and individual action. Even when she takes her place among
5995,SECT. II.,"the deities in the array of battle, it is not said that she stood up"
5996,SECT. II.,"against Mercury, but simply that Mercury stood up against her[268]."
5997,SECT. II.,
5998,SECT. II.,[268] Il. xx. 72.
5999,SECT. II.,
6000,SECT. II.,"The three cases are as follows. First, when he makes over to her the"
6001,SECT. II.,"victory in waiving the fight, she offers no reply; but simply picks up"
6002,SECT. II.,"her daughter Diana’s bow and arrows, and goes after her, apparently"
6003,SECT. II.,with the intention of offering her comfort. The next action[269]
6004,SECT. II.,attributed to her is this: that when Apollo[270] has carried the
6005,SECT. II.,"bruised and stunned Æneas into his temple on Pergamus, Latona and"
6006,SECT. II.,Diana tend him there. Thus both of these actions exhibit her in strict
6007,SECT. II.,"ideal subordination, so to speak, to one of her children, as though"
6008,SECT. II.,by tradition she existed only for them. But the second is especially
6009,SECT. II.,"remarkable, and alike illustrative of the traditional basis of the"
6010,SECT. II.,Mother and of the Son.
6011,SECT. II.,
6012,SECT. II.,[269] Il. xxi. 496-504.
6013,SECT. II.,
6014,SECT. II.,[270] Il. v. 445. _et seqq._
6015,SECT. II.,
6016,SECT. II.,"In the first place, as it appears to me, there can hardly be a"
6017,SECT. II.,"circumstance more singular, according to the principles of the Greek"
6018,SECT. II.,"mythology, than that any one deity should be introduced as acting, not"
6019,SECT. II.,"in her own temple, but in the temple of another. Such however is here"
6020,SECT. II.,the case with Latona and Diana in the temple of Apollo.
6021,SECT. II.,
6022,SECT. II.,"Next, they are acting as purely ministerial to him. They do not enter"
6023,SECT. II.,"into the fray: it is he who has been there, and who, having deposited"
6024,SECT. II.,"Æneas, immediately prosecutes the affairs of the battle-field, while"
6025,SECT. II.,"they, as his satellites, give effect to his purpose in setting about"
6026,SECT. II.,the restoration of the disabled warrior.
6027,SECT. II.,
6028,SECT. II.,"Lastly, the significance of this action is raised to the highest point,"
6029,SECT. II.,when we recollect that this is a mother executing the design of her
6030,SECT. II.,"son. Latona’s action in the Twenty-first Book, like that of Dione with"
6031,SECT. II.,"Venus, can be accounted for by her maternal character. But there is"
6032,SECT. II.,"no case in the Homeric poems besides this, where we see a parent-god"
6033,SECT. II.,thus acting ministerially in the execution of the plans of his or her
6034,SECT. II.,"offspring. The primeval tradition, once admitted as the basis of the"
6035,SECT. II.,"mythological group, furnishes us with the key to what would otherwise"
6036,SECT. II.,be another great anomaly.
6037,SECT. II.,
6038,SECT. II.,"The third case is in entire harmony with the other two. Tityus, the son"
6039,SECT. II.,"of Earth, is tortured in the nether world for having offered violence"
6040,SECT. II.,"to Latona, and the crime was committed when she was on her way through"
6041,SECT. II.,Panopeus to Delphi. This was probably the route from Delos to that
6042,SECT. II.,place: so that again the poet seems to represent Latona in close but
6043,SECT. II.,"subordinate connection with her son, by making her travel between the"
6044,SECT. II.,seats of his two already famous oracles.
6045,SECT. II.,
6046,SECT. II.,"Apollo, then, with Latona and Diana, forms a group; and the origin"
6047,SECT. II.,of the combination is to be sought in primitive tradition. It is not
6048,SECT. II.,necessary to show that the personages thus associated maintained their
6049,SECT. II.,association in all the religions of the East. I admit that we are not
6050,SECT. II.,"to suppose, that the idea of this combination passed direct from the"
6051,SECT. II.,patriarchs into Greece. The most natural place in which to seek for
6052,SECT. II.,"traces of it would be, in the religion of the Persians, anterior to"
6053,SECT. II.,the time of Homer. Unfortunately we have no accounts of it at any
6054,SECT. II.,"such date. But our failing to find these three deities in a company,"
6055,SECT. II.,"or to find any germ which might have been developed into that company,"
6056,SECT. II.,"in accounts later by probably five or six centuries at least, raises"
6057,SECT. II.,no presumption whatever against the hypothesis that we may owe the
6058,SECT. II.,"representation, as it stands in Homer, to historical derivation through"
6059,SECT. II.,"the forefathers of the Hellic tribes, from some such period as that"
6060,SECT. II.,"when, for example, Abraham dwelt in Ur of the Chaldees[271]."

6064,SECT. II.,~_The Iris of Homer._~
6065,SECT. II.,
6066,SECT. II.,"Iris, the messenger goddess, the last, and also by much the least"
6067,SECT. II.,"important of the personages to whom I ascribe a traditive origin, is"
6068,SECT. II.,perhaps not the least clear in her title to it.
6069,SECT. II.,
6070,SECT. II.,Her title to rank as one of the deities of the ordinary Olympian
6071,SECT. II.,assemblage is not subject to doubt. It depends partly on the fact that
6072,SECT. II.,she is always at hand there. But it is established more distinctly
6073,SECT. II.,"still by the passage, which represents her as carrying to the palace"
6074,SECT. II.,of Zephyr the prayer of Achilles. She finds the Winds engaged in a
6075,SECT. II.,"banquet, and they eagerly solicit her to sit and feast with them."
6076,SECT. II.,"She answers them, like one desirous to escape from second-rate into"
6077,SECT. II.,"first-rate company, to the effect that she has not time: the Ethiopians"
6078,SECT. II.,are just about supplying the greater gods with a banquet from their
6079,SECT. II.,"hecatombs; and she must repair to that quarter accordingly, as"
6080,SECT. II.,otherwise she will lose her share of the offerings[272].
6081,SECT. II.,
6082,SECT. II.,[272] Il. xxiii. 198-212.
6083,SECT. II.,
6084,SECT. II.,"With respect to her position generally, we have no mark of her being"
6085,SECT. II.,"foreign; and all the traditive deities, it may be observed, are"
6086,SECT. II.,"sufficiently, though not exclusively national. Again, we have no mark"
6087,SECT. II.,"of her being recent; on the contrary, she is without parents, and"
6088,SECT. II.,"this, though not conclusive, is a sign to the opposite effect."
6089,SECT. II.,
6090,SECT. II.,"Iris has no original action whatever, but is simply a willing servant"
6091,SECT. II.,of other deities; nor does she disdain spontaneously to officiate
6092,SECT. II.,"on behalf of a distinguished human object of their favour, like"
6093,SECT. II.,Achilles[273]. Only once have we an account of her bringing an order
6094,SECT. II.,"without the name of the sender: it is when she appears to Helen, and"
6095,SECT. II.,"exhorts her to repair to the Wall[274]. She is not, however, said even"
6096,SECT. II.,in this place to act on her own account; and we ought probably to
6097,SECT. II.,"understand that, according to the general rule, she comes from Jupiter."
6098,SECT. II.,"It is added, that she inspired Helen with a longing sentiment towards"
6099,SECT. II.,"her former husband and country, but this, as is most likely, is meant"
6100,SECT. II.,simply to describe the effect of her words in the ordinary manner of
6101,SECT. II.,their operation on the understanding. This ancillary character of
6102,SECT. II.,"Iris is exactly what she would bear, if her origin really lay in the"
6103,SECT. II.,primitive tradition of the rainbow.
6104,SECT. II.,
6105,SECT. II.,[273] Il. xxiii. 198-212.
6106,SECT. II.,
6107,SECT. II.,[274] Il. iii. 121.
6108,SECT. II.,
6109,SECT. II.,But what seems decisively to establish her relation to that tradition
6110,SECT. II.,"is, that she is firmly connected in Homer with two things that have"
6111,SECT. II.,"in themselves no connection whatever, and between which that ancient"
6112,SECT. II.,tradition is the only link.
6113,SECT. II.,
6114,SECT. II.,"In the first place, her identity of name is the witness to her original"
6115,SECT. II.,"connection with the rainbow[275]: which, however, as a standing and"
6116,SECT. II.,"ordinary phenomenon of nature, did not bear, apart from positive"
6117,SECT. II.,"appointment, in any manner the character of a messenger: and hence we"
6118,SECT. II.,find that by disintegration the two ideas had been entirely separated
6119,SECT. II.,"before the time of Homer, and the name itself is the only remaining"
6120,SECT. II.,witness in the poems to their having been at some former period
6121,SECT. II.,associated. The function of the messenger was kept in action by the
6122,SECT. II.,"occasions of the Olympian family and polity. In this manner, as the"
6123,SECT. II.,"stronger of the two ideas, it held its ground, and took possession of"
6124,SECT. II.,"the personal Iris, while the rainbow, though still conceived of as a"
6125,SECT. II.,"sign to mortals[276], appears to have been regarded as separate."
6126,SECT. II.,
6127,SECT. II.,[275] Il. xi. 27.
6128,SECT. II.,
6129,SECT. II.,[276] Il. xi. 29.
6130,SECT. II.,
6131,SECT. II.,Of the character of the messenger we find that Iris had so completely
6132,SECT. II.,"become the model, that her name, only modified into Iros, is given to"
6133,SECT. II.,"Arnæus, the ribald and burly beggar of the Odyssey, only because he was"
6134,SECT. II.,"a go-between, or errand-carrier:"
6135,SECT. II.,
6136,SECT. II.,"οὕνεκ’ ἀπαγγέλλεσκε κιὼν, ὅτε πού τις ἀνώγοι[277]."
6137,SECT. II.,
6138,SECT. II.,[277] Od. xviii. 7.
6139,SECT. II.,
6140,SECT. II.,"The hypothesis, then, of traditional origin is the key, and the only"
6141,SECT. II.,"key, to the position of the Homeric Iris."
6142,SECT. II.,
6143,SECT. II.,~_The Atè of Homer._~
6144,SECT. II.,
6145,SECT. II.,Before quitting the precinct of the primeval tradition discoverable
6146,SECT. II.,"in Homer, we have yet one very remarkable group of impersonations to"
6147,SECT. II.,"consider, that in which the goddess Ἄτη is the leading figure. Commonly"
6148,SECT. II.,"regarded as meaning Mischief, the word is not capable of being fully"
6149,SECT. II.,"rendered in English: but Guile is its primary idea, in the train of"
6150,SECT. II.,which come the sister notions of Folly and Calamity.
6151,SECT. II.,
6152,SECT. II.,Ἄτη both wishes and suggests all ill to mortals; but she does not seem
6153,SECT. II.,"in Homer to have any power of injuring them, except through channels,"
6154,SECT. II.,which have been wholly or partially opened to her by their own volition.
6155,SECT. II.,
6156,SECT. II.,"The Ἄτη of the later Greeks is Calamity simply, with a shadow of"
6157,SECT. II.,Destiny hanging in the distance; as in the magnificent figure of the
6158,SECT. II.,lion’s cub in Æschylus[278]. But the word never bears in Homer the
6159,SECT. II.,sense of calamity coming simply from without. This is evident even
6160,SECT. II.,"from the large and general description, where she appears in company"
6161,SECT. II.,"with the Λιταί[279]. Vigorous and nimble, she ranges over the whole"
6162,SECT. II.,"earth for mischief. After her, slowly lag the Prayers or Λιταὶ,"
6163,SECT. II.,"honoured however in being, like her, daughters of Jupiter. These are"
6164,SECT. II.,"limping, decrepit, and unable to see straight before them. The leading"
6165,SECT. II.,"idea of Ἄτη is not force, but cunning. She is the power that tempts"
6166,SECT. II.,"and misleads men to their own cost or ruin, as they afterwards find"
6167,SECT. II.,"out. Nay, she tempts the deity also: for she beguiles even Jupiter"
6168,SECT. II.,"himself[280] when Hercules is about to be born, and induces him"
6169,SECT. II.,"thoughtlessly to promise what will, through Juno’s craft, overturn"
6170,SECT. II.,"his own dearly cherished plans. For this excess of daring, however,"
6171,SECT. II.,"she herself suffers. Jupiter seizes her by the hair, and hurls her"
6172,SECT. II.,"from Olympus, apparently her native seat. Thenceforward she can only"
6173,SECT. II.,"exercise her function among men; who, when they have yielded to the"
6174,SECT. II.,"seduction, and tasted the ashes under the golden fruit, at length set"
6175,SECT. II.,about repentance or prayer:
6176,SECT. II.,
6177,SECT. II.,[278] Æsch. Agam. 696-715.
6178,SECT. II.,
6179,SECT. II.,[279] Il. ix. 499-514.
6180,SECT. II.,
6181,SECT. II.,[280] Il. xix. 95 seqq.
6182,SECT. II.,
6183,SECT. II.,"All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost![281]"
6184,SECT. II.,
6185,SECT. II.,"[281] Tempest, I. 1."
6186,SECT. II.,
6187,SECT. II.,Now though the impersonation of Atè in Homer is one of the
6188,SECT. II.,"indeterminate class, it is surely a mistake to treat it as representing"
6189,SECT. II.,"the mere poetical incorporation of an abstract idea. On the contrary,"
6190,SECT. II.,we seem to find in it the old tradition of the Evil One as the Tempter;
6191,SECT. II.,and it may be said that the word Temptress would best represent the
6192,SECT. II.,Homeric idea of Ἄτη. In this sense it will supply a consistent meaning
6193,SECT. II.,"to the fine passage in the speech of Phœnix: for we are swift, so says"
6194,SECT. II.,"the Poet, to fall into temptation, and to offend, ingenious only in"
6195,SECT. II.,"not seeing our fault, and covering it with excuses: but slow, and like"
6196,SECT. II.,"the half-hearted, decrepit Λιταί, when we have to make our entreaties"
6197,SECT. II.,"for pardon, and to think of restitution and amendment. Yet as even the"
6198,SECT. II.,"gods listen to their entreaties, ‘so,’ says Phœnix, ‘shouldst thou, O"
6199,SECT. II.,"Achilles: and if thou dost not, then mayest yet thyself fall.’ But if"
6200,SECT. II.,"Ἄτη meant only misfortune, the passage loses all its harmony, and even"
6201,SECT. II.,becomes absurd; for surely none will say that men are slow to discern
6202,SECT. II.,"adversity, or to offer petitions, wherever they have a prospect of"
6203,SECT. II.,"being heard, for relief from it."
6204,SECT. II.,
6205,SECT. II.,There is no passage which appears to me more characteristic of the true
6206,SECT. II.,"distinctive character of the Homeric Ἄτη, than that in which Dolon"
6207,SECT. II.,confesses his folly[282]:
6208,SECT. II.,
6209,SECT. II.,[282] Il. x. 390.
6210,SECT. II.,
6211,SECT. II.,πολλῇσίν μ’ ἄτῃσι παρὲκ νόον ἤγαγεν Ἕκτωρ.
6212,SECT. II.,
6213,SECT. II.,"Here we have Hector, the tempter: ἄται, the temptation: νόος, the sound"
6214,SECT. II.,"mind, from which temptation diverted the self-duped simpleton: ἤγαγεν,"
6215,SECT. II.,"expressive of the medium, namely, through volition, and not by force."
6216,SECT. II.,
6217,SECT. II.,"The elements combined in the idea of the Homeric Ἄτη, and the"
6218,SECT. II.,"conditions of her action, may be presented together as follows:"
6219,SECT. II.,
6220,SECT. II.,1. She takes the reins of the understanding and conduct of a man.
6221,SECT. II.,
6222,SECT. II.,"2. She effects this not by force from without, but through the medium"
6223,SECT. II.,"of his own will and inward consent, whether unconscious or express."
6224,SECT. II.,
6225,SECT. II.,"3. Under her dominion he commits offences against the moral law, or the"
6226,SECT. II.,law of prudence.
6227,SECT. II.,
6228,SECT. II.,4. These offences are followed by his retributive sufferings.
6229,SECT. II.,
6230,SECT. II.,The function of the Tempter is here represented with great precision;
6231,SECT. II.,but two essential variations have come to be perceptible in the idea
6232,SECT. II.,taken as a whole.
6233,SECT. II.,
6234,SECT. II.,"The first, that this Ἄτη is herself sometimes prompted or sent by"
6235,SECT. II.,"others, as by Ἐρίνυς, (Od. xv. 234,) or by her with Ζεὺς and Μοῖρα, as"
6236,SECT. II.,"in Il. xix. 87. And accordingly she too is a daughter, nay, the eldest"
6237,SECT. II.,"daughter, of Jupiter himself[283]."
6238,SECT. II.,
6239,SECT. II.,[283] Il. xix. 91.
6240,SECT. II.,
6241,SECT. II.,The second variation is this: that offences against the mere law of
6242,SECT. II.,"prudence find their way into precisely the same category with sins; or,"
6243,SECT. II.,"in other words, the true idea of sin had been lost. Ἄτη the person, and"
6244,SECT. II.,"ἄτη the effect, are, moreover, frequently blended by the Poet."
6245,SECT. II.,
6246,SECT. II.,"Among the principal Ἄται of Homer are those,"
6247,SECT. II.,
6248,SECT. II.,"1. Of Jupiter, Il. xix. 91-129."
6249,SECT. II.,
6250,SECT. II.,"2. Of Dolon, Il. x. 391; leading him to accept the proposal of Hector."
6251,SECT. II.,
6252,SECT. II.,"3. Of Melampus, Od. xv. 233, 4, causing him to undertake an enterprise"
6253,SECT. II.,beyond his means on account of the daughter of Neleus.
6254,SECT. II.,
6255,SECT. II.,All of which are against the law of prudence and forethought.
6256,SECT. II.,
6257,SECT. II.,"4. Of Agamemnon, Il. xix. 88, 134-8."
6258,SECT. II.,
6259,SECT. II.,"5. Of Paris, Il. vi. 356, xxiv. 28."
6260,SECT. II.,
6261,SECT. II.,"6. Of Helen, Od. iv. 261. xxiii. 223."
6262,SECT. II.,
6263,SECT. II.,"7. Of manslaughter, Il. xxiv. 480."
6264,SECT. II.,
6265,SECT. II.,"8. Of the drunken centaur Eurytion, who had his ears and nose cut off"
6266,SECT. II.,"for his excesses, Od. xxi. 296-302."
6267,SECT. II.,
6268,SECT. II.,"In one place only of Homer, ἄτη seems to mean calamity not imputable"
6269,SECT. II.,"to the sufferer’s fault, further than by some slight want of vigilance."
6270,SECT. II.,"This is the ἄτη charged upon Ulysses, when his companions destroy the"
6271,SECT. II.,"oxen of the Sun, Od. xii. 372. At least he had no further share in that"
6272,SECT. II.,"matter than that, by going to sleep, he left his comrades to act for"
6273,SECT. II.,themselves.
6274,SECT. II.,
6275,SECT. II.,The long continued misconduct of the Suitors is never described as
6276,SECT. II.,their ἄτη: probably because the word properly signifies a particular
6277,SECT. II.,"temptation followed by a particular act, rather than a continued course"
6278,SECT. II.,of action.
6279,SECT. II.,
6280,SECT. II.,"This, again, serves the more closely to associate Ἄτη with the"
6281,SECT. II.,primitive tradition of the Fall of Man.
6282,SECT. II.,
6283,SECT. II.,"The higher form of human wickedness, which is attended with deliberate"
6284,SECT. II.,"and obstinate persistence in wrong, is not ἄτη but ἀτασθαλίη. Such is"
6285,SECT. II.,the wickedness of Ægisthus and of the Suitors; such also that of the
6286,SECT. II.,"Giants. The same phrase is applied to the crew of Ulysses, who devoured"
6287,SECT. II.,the oxen of the Sun[284]: and this appears to conform to the view taken
6288,SECT. II.,"of their offence in the poems, however anomalous that view itself may"
6289,SECT. II.,be.
6290,SECT. II.,
6291,SECT. II.,[284] Od. i. 7.
6292,SECT. II.,
6293,SECT. II.,~_Other traditions of the Evil One._~
6294,SECT. II.,
6295,SECT. II.,I will now gather into one view the dispersed fragments of tradition
6296,SECT. II.,concerning the Evil One which seem to be discernible in Homer.
6297,SECT. II.,
6298,SECT. II.,"1. Ἄτη is the first, and the one which comes nearest to presenting a"
6299,SECT. II.,general outline.
6300,SECT. II.,
6301,SECT. II.,"2. A second is found in Κρόνος[285], who aims at the destruction of"
6302,SECT. II.,"Godhead in its supreme representatives, and is thrust down to Tartarus"
6303,SECT. II.,by Jupiter. And we may here observe an important distinction.
6304,SECT. II.,
6305,SECT. II.,[285] Il. xiv. 203. viii. 478. where Iapetus is joined with Κρόνος. Of
6306,SECT. II.,him we have no other mention in Homer.
6307,SECT. II.,
6308,SECT. II.,"Some persons, like Tityus, offend against a particular person who had"
6309,SECT. II.,"taken a place in the Olympian Court; or else, apparently like Orion,"
6310,SECT. II.,offend the gods in general by their presumption. They are punished in
6311,SECT. II.,the Shades. But those who have aimed at the dethronement or destruction
6312,SECT. II.,of Godhead itself are in the far deeper darkness of Tartarus[286].
6313,SECT. II.,I suggest this as a possible explanation of the double place of
6314,SECT. II.,punishment; which is otherwise apparently a gross solecism in the
6315,SECT. II.,Homeric system.
6316,SECT. II.,
6317,SECT. II.,[286] Il. viii. 13-18.
6318,SECT. II.,
6319,SECT. II.,"3. To the latter class of offenders belong the Titans, who most"
6320,SECT. II.,"pointedly represent the element of Force in the ancient traditions,"
6321,SECT. II.,while Ἄτη embodies that of Guile.
6322,SECT. II.,
6323,SECT. II.,"These are the θεοὶ ὑποταρτάρεοι, or the ἐνέρτεροι, or ἔνερθε θεοὶ,"
6324,SECT. II.,who form the infernal court of Κρόνος; Κρόνον ἄμφις ἐόντες (Il.
6325,SECT. II.,"xiv. 274, 9. xv. 225). They are evidently themselves in a state of"
6326,SECT. II.,penal suffering; but they must also have the power of inflicting the
6327,SECT. II.,"severest punishment on some other offenders; for they, and not Aides or"
6328,SECT. II.,"Persephone, seem to be the persons called to be witnesses of the solemn"
6329,SECT. II.,"oath for the avoidance of perjury, taken by Juno in the Fourteenth"
6330,SECT. II.,Book[287].
6331,SECT. II.,
6332,SECT. II.,"[287] Il. xiv. 273, 278."
6333,SECT. II.,
6334,SECT. II.,4. Of these Titans two are apparently named in the persons of Otus and
6335,SECT. II.,"Ephialtes, children of Neptune."
6336,SECT. II.,
6337,SECT. II.,"5. To the same class, in all probability, belong the Giants, led by"
6338,SECT. II.,"Eurymedon, and born of the same mythological father. Od. vii. 58."
6339,SECT. II.,
6340,SECT. II.,6. It is likely that Typhoeus may have been of the same company;
6341,SECT. II.,"for although he is not stated to be in Tartarus, yet his position"
6342,SECT. II.,corresponds with it in the essential feature of being under the earth.
6343,SECT. II.,"(Il. ii. 782. viii. 14). Homer does not indeed expressly say, that Otus"
6344,SECT. II.,"and Ephialtes were Titans, nor that Eurymedon was of the same band; nor"
6345,SECT. II.,yet that the Titans were rebels against heaven. But his images are so
6346,SECT. II.,combined round certain points as to make this matter of safe and clear
6347,SECT. II.,inference.
6348,SECT. II.,
6349,SECT. II.,"For the Titans are in Tartarus, and are with and attached to Κρόνος,"
6350,SECT. II.,"whom Jupiter thrust down thither. And the giants under Eurymedon, for"
6351,SECT. II.,"their mad audacity, are driven to perdition[288]. Lastly, Otus and"
6352,SECT. II.,"Ephialtes, who made war upon heaven, and whom Apollo quelled, not"
6353,SECT. II.,"appearing, like their mother Iphimedea, in the Shades of the Eleventh"
6354,SECT. II.,"Odyssey, can only be in Tartarus[289]."
6355,SECT. II.,
6356,SECT. II.,[288] Od. vii. 60.
6357,SECT. II.,
6358,SECT. II.,[289] Od. xi. 305-20.
6359,SECT. II.,
6360,SECT. II.,From the scattered traditions we may collect and combine the essential
6361,SECT. II.,"points. In Otus and Ephialtes the rebellion is clearly stated, and in"
6362,SECT. II.,"Eurymedon it is manifestly implied. In the Titans, who are called θεοὶ,"
6363,SECT. II.,"and in their association with Κρόνος, as also in the high parentage of"
6364,SECT. II.,"the others, we have the celestial origin of the rebels. In the hurling"
6365,SECT. II.,"down of Κρόνος to Tartarus, we have the punishment which they all are"
6366,SECT. II.,"enduring, immediately associated with an act of supreme retribution."
6367,SECT. II.,
6368,SECT. II.,"7. Elsewhere will be found a notice of the singular relation, which"
6369,SECT. II.,may be traced between Neptune and the tradition of the Evil One. This
6370,SECT. II.,relation is mythological in its basis: but it seems to proceed upon the
6371,SECT. II.,"tradition, that the Evil One was next to the Highest."
6372,SECT. II.,
6373,SECT. II.,8. A more recent form of the tradition concerning the great war in
6374,SECT. II.,"heaven seems to be found in the revolt of the Immortals of Olympus,"
6375,SECT. II.,"headed by Juno, Neptune, and Minerva, against Jupiter, which was put"
6376,SECT. II.,down by Briareus or Ægæon of the hundred hands.
6377,SECT. II.,
6378,SECT. II.,"Who this Ægæon was, we can only conjecture: he is nowhere else named"
6379,SECT. II.,"in Homer. From his having a double name, one in use among gods, and"
6380,SECT. II.,"the other among mortals, it might be conjectured that the immediate"
6381,SECT. II.,"source of this tradition was either Egypt, or some other country having"
6382,SECT. II.,"like Egypt an hieratic and also a demotic tongue. In its substance, it"
6383,SECT. II.,can hardly be other than a separate and dislocated form of the same
6384,SECT. II.,"idea, according to which we see Apollo handed down as the deliverer of"
6385,SECT. II.,Olympus from rebellion. The expression that _all_ men (Il. i. 403.)
6386,SECT. II.,"call him Ægæon, tends to universalize him, and thus to connect him with"
6387,SECT. II.,"Apollo. He is also (v. 403.) a son of Jupiter, avowedly superior to him"
6388,SECT. II.,in strength:

6394,SECT. II.,It is perhaps worth while to notice the coincidence between the

6446,SECT. II.,We thus appear to find in Homer many displaced fragments of the old
6447,SECT. II.,traditions of the Bible with respect to the Evil One. In the later
6448,SECT. II.,"Greek and the Roman literature, the traditions on the same subject had"
6449,SECT. II.,almost entirely lost their likeness to their original. The figure of
6450,SECT. II.,"Ἄτη, and the idea of spiritual danger to man through guile tempting"
6451,SECT. II.,"him extrinsically but inwardly, entirely disappears. There remains"
6452,SECT. II.,"only the recollection of a contest waged by brute force, and a solitary"
6453,SECT. II.,"remnant of forgotten truth in the fame still adhering to Apollo, that"
6454,SECT. II.,"he had been the deliverer and conqueror, who in the critical hour"
6455,SECT. II.,vindicated the supremacy of heaven. In the time of Horace even this
6456,SECT. II.,recollection had become darkened and confused.
6457,SECT. II.,
6458,SECT. II.,"From the Homeric traditions of the Evil One and the fallen angels, we"
6459,SECT. II.,"may properly pass to those of a future state, which involves, partially"
6460,SECT. II.,"at least, the idea of retribution."
6461,SECT. II.,
6462,SECT. II.,~_The Future State in Homer._~
6463,SECT. II.,
6464,SECT. II.,The representations of the future state in Homer are perhaps the more
6465,SECT. II.,"interesting, because it may be doubted whether they are, logically,"
6466,SECT. II.,quite consistent with one another. For this want of consistency becomes
6467,SECT. II.,"of itself a negative argument in support of the belief that, as they"
6468,SECT. II.,"are not capable of being referred to any one generative idea or system,"
6469,SECT. II.,they may be distorted copies or misunderstood portions of primitive
6470,SECT. II.,truth.
6471,SECT. II.,
6472,SECT. II.,Another reason for referring them to this origin appears to be found in
6473,SECT. II.,"their gradual deterioration after the time of Homer. In his theology,"
6474,SECT. II.,future retribution appears as a real sanction of the moral law. In the
6475,SECT. II.,"later history, and generally in the philosophy of Paganism, it has"
6476,SECT. II.,"lost this place: practically, a phantasmagoria was substituted for"
6477,SECT. II.,what had been at least a subjective reality: and the most sincere and
6478,SECT. II.,penetrating minds thought it absurd to associate anything of substance
6479,SECT. II.,with the condition of the dead[292]. The moral ideas connected with it
6480,SECT. II.,appear before us in descending series; and thus they point backwards
6481,SECT. II.,to the remotest period for their origin and their integrity.

6487,SECT. II.,Revelation describes.
6488,SECT. II.,
6489,SECT. II.,"That world appears to us, in Homer, in three divisions."
6490,SECT. II.,
6491,SECT. II.,"First there is the Elysian plain, apparently under the government of"
6492,SECT. II.,"Rhadamanthus, at which Menelaus, as the favoured son-in-law of Jupiter,"
6493,SECT. II.,"is to arrive. It is, physically at least, furnished with all the"
6494,SECT. II.,conditions of repose and happiness.
6495,SECT. II.,
6496,SECT. II.,"Next there is the region of Aides or Aidoneus, the ordinary receptacle"
6497,SECT. II.,"even of the illustrious dead, such as Achilles, Agamemnon, and the"
6498,SECT. II.,"older Greek heroes of divine extraction. Hither, if we may trust the"
6499,SECT. II.,"Twenty-fourth Odyssey, are carried the Suitors; and here is found the"
6500,SECT. II.,insignificant Elpenor (Od. xi. 51).
6501,SECT. II.,
6502,SECT. II.,"Thirdly, there is the region of Tartarus, where Κρόνος and Ἰάπετος"
6503,SECT. II.,"reign. This is as far below Aides, as the heaven is upwards from the"
6504,SECT. II.,earth[293].
6505,SECT. II.,
6506,SECT. II.,"[293] Il. viii. 16, 479."
6507,SECT. II.,
6508,SECT. II.,There appears to be some want of clearness in the division between the
6509,SECT. II.,"second region and the third as to their respective offices, and between"
6510,SECT. II.,the second and the first as to their respective tenants.
6511,SECT. II.,
6512,SECT. II.,"The realm of Aides is, in general, not a place of punishment, but of"
6513,SECT. II.,desolation and of gloom[294]. The shade of Agamemnon weeps aloud with
6514,SECT. II.,emotion and desire to clasp Ulysses: and Ulysses in vain attempts
6515,SECT. II.,"to console Achilles, for having quitted ‘the warm precincts of the"
6516,SECT. II.,"cheerful day.’ But though their state is one of sadness, neither they"
6517,SECT. II.,nor the dead who are named there are in general under any judicial
6518,SECT. II.,"infliction. It is stated, indeed, that Minos[295] administers justice"
6519,SECT. II.,"among them; but we are not told whether, as seems most probable, this"
6520,SECT. II.,"is in determining decisively the fate of each, or whether he merely"
6521,SECT. II.,"disposes, as he might have done on earth, of such cases as chanced to"
6522,SECT. II.,arise between any of them for adjudication.

6530,[295] V. 569.,"here, are evident objects of the favour of the gods[296]. Hercules,"
6531,[295] V. 569.,"like Helen of the later tradition, is curiously disintegrated."

6535,[295] V. 569.,"His εἴδωλον meets Ulysses, and speaks as if possessed of his identity:"
6536,[295] V. 569.,but he himself (αὐτὸς) is enjoying reward among the Immortals. The
6537,[295] V. 569.,latter of these images represents the laborious and philanthropic side
6538,[295] V. 569.,"of the character attributed to him, the former the reckless and brutal"
6539,[295] V. 569.,one. Again it might be thought that the reason for the advancement of
6540,[295] V. 569.,"Menelaus to Elysium, while Castor and Pollux belong to the under-world,"
6541,[295] V. 569.,"was the very virtuous character of that prince. He is, however, not"
6542,[295] V. 569.,"promoted thither for his virtues, but for being the son-in-law of"
6543,[295] V. 569.,"Jupiter by his marriage with Helen. And thus again, the son-in-law of"
6544,[295] V. 569.,"Jupiter is, as such, placed higher than his sons."
6545,[295] V. 569.,
6546,[295] V. 569.,The proper and main business of Tartarus is to serve as a place of
6547,[295] V. 569.,punishment for deposed and condemned Immortals. There were Iapetos
6548,[295] V. 569.,"and Κρόνος, there the Titans[297]: there probably Otus and Ephialtes,"
6549,[295] V. 569.,"who not only wounded Mars but assaulted Olympus[298]: there too, were"
6550,[295] V. 569.,"Eurymedon and the Giants, who perished by their ἀτασθάλιαι. Thither"
6551,[295] V. 569.,it is that Jupiter threatens to hurl down offensive and refractory
6552,[295] V. 569.,divinities[299]. Direct rebellion against heaven seems to be the
6553,[295] V. 569.,specific offence which draws down the sentence of relegation to
6554,[295] V. 569.,"Tartarus. Still in the Third Iliad Agamemnon invokes certain deities,"
6555,[295] V. 569.,as the avengers of perjury upon man[300];

6567,[295] V. 569.,
6568,[295] V. 569.,It is not clear whether this passage implies that all perjurors are
6569,[295] V. 569.,"punished in Tartarus; or whether Aidoneus, Persephone, and the Erinues"
6570,[295] V. 569.,are the subterraneous deities here intended: but as the Titans are
6571,[295] V. 569.,"elsewhere only mentioned in express connection with Tartarus, and from"
6572,[295] V. 569.,"the description of the Erinues in Il. xix. 259, I incline to the latter"
6573,[295] V. 569.,opinion.
6574,[295] V. 569.,
6575,[295] V. 569.,"On the whole, then, there is some confusion between these compartments,"
6576,[295] V. 569.,"so to speak, of the invisible world. The realm of Aidoneus seems to"
6577,[295] V. 569.,"partake, in part, of the character both of Tartarus and of the Elysian"
6578,[295] V. 569.,"plain. In common with the former, it includes persons who were objects"
6579,[295] V. 569.,"of especial divine favour. In common with Tartarus, it is for some few,"
6580,[295] V. 569.,"at least, a scene of positive punishment."
6581,[295] V. 569.,
6582,[295] V. 569.,"Still, if we take the three according to their leading idea, they are"
6583,[295] V. 569.,in substantial correspondence with divine revelation. There is the
6584,[295] V. 569.,"place of bliss, the final destination of the good. There is the place"
6585,[295] V. 569.,"of torment, occupied by the Evil One and his rebellious companions:"
6586,[295] V. 569.,"and there is an intermediate state, the receptacle of the dead."
6587,[295] V. 569.,"Here, as might be expected, the resemblance terminates; for as there"
6588,[295] V. 569.,"is no selection for entrance into the kingdom of Aides, so there"
6589,[295] V. 569.,is no passage onwards from it. We need the less wonder at the too
6590,[295] V. 569.,"comprehensive place it occupies, relatively to the places of reward"
6591,[295] V. 569.,"and punishment proper, in the Homeric scheme, when we remember what"
6592,[295] V. 569.,"a tendency to develop itself beyond all bounds, the simple primitive"
6593,[295] V. 569.,"doctrine of the intermediate state has been made to exhibit, in a"
6594,[295] V. 569.,portion of the Christian Church.
6595,[295] V. 569.,
6596,[295] V. 569.,A further element of indistinctness attaches to the invisible world
6597,[295] V. 569.,"of Homer, if we take into view the admission of favoured mortals to"
6598,[295] V. 569.,"Olympus; a process of which he gives us instances, as in Ganymedes"
6599,[295] V. 569.,"and Hercules. In a work of pure invention it is unlikely that Heaven,"
6600,[295] V. 569.,"Elysium, and the under-world would all have been represented as"
6601,[295] V. 569.,receptacles of souls in favour with the Deity. But some primitive
6602,[295] V. 569.,tradition of the translation of Enoch may account for what would
6603,[295] V. 569.,otherwise stand as an additional anomaly.
6604,[295] V. 569.,
6605,[295] V. 569.,"Upon the whole, the Homeric pictures of the prolongation of our"
6606,[295] V. 569.,individual existence beyond the grave; the continuance in the nether
6607,[295] V. 569.,world of the habits and propensities acquired or confirmed in this;
6608,[295] V. 569.,and the administration in the infernal regions of penalties for sin;
6609,[295] V. 569.,"all these things, though vaguely conceived, stand in marked contrast"
6610,[295] V. 569.,"with the far more shadowy, impersonal, and, above all, morally neutral"
6611,[295] V. 569.,"pictures of the invisible and future world, which alone were admitted"
6612,[295] V. 569.,into the practical belief of the best among the Greek philosophers. We
6613,[295] V. 569.,are left to presume that the superior picture owed its superiority to
6614,[295] V. 569.,"the fact that it was not of man’s devising, as it thus so far exceeded"

6621,[295] V. 569.,"causes, was perhaps the best preserved of all its parts among nations"

6626,[295] V. 569.,perceive that this highly spiritual ordinance was one little likely to
6627,[295] V. 569.,"survive the rude shocks and necessities of earthly life, while it could"
6628,[295] V. 569.,"not, like sacrifice, derive a sustaining force from appearing to confer"

6632,[295] V. 569.,Those who feel inclined to wonder at this disappearance of the sabbath
6633,[295] V. 569.,"from the record may do well to remember, that on the shield of"
6634,[295] V. 569.,"Achilles, which represents the standing occasions of life in all its"
6635,[295] V. 569.,"departments, there is no one scene which represents any observances"
6636,[295] V. 569.,"simply religious. The religious element, though corrupted, was far from"
6637,[295] V. 569.,"being expelled out of common life; on the contrary, the whole tissue"

6657,SECT. III.,"I come now to that mass of Homeric deities, who are either wholly"
6658,SECT. III.,"mythological, or so loaded with mythological features, that their"
6659,SECT. III.,"traditive character is depressed, and of secondary importance."
6660,SECT. III.,
6661,SECT. III.,_Jupiter._
6662,SECT. III.,
6663,SECT. III.,"The character of Jupiter, which commonly occupies the first place in"
6664,SECT. III.,"discussions of the Greek mythology, has been in some degree forestalled"
6665,SECT. III.,by our prior examination of the position of other figures in the
6666,SECT. III.,"system, which are both more interesting and more important, from their"
6667,SECT. III.,bearing more significant resemblances to and traces of the truth of
6668,SECT. III.,Divine Revelation.
6669,SECT. III.,
6670,SECT. III.,"Nevertheless, this character will well repay attention. To be"
6671,SECT. III.,"understood and appreciated, it must be viewed in a great variety of"
6672,SECT. III.,"aspects. When so viewed, it will be found to range from the sublime"
6673,SECT. III.,"down to the brutal, and almost even down to the ridiculous. Upon the"
6674,SECT. III.,"whole, when we consider that the image which we thus bring before us"
6675,SECT. III.,"was during so many ages, for such multitudes of the most remarkable"
6676,SECT. III.,"portion of mankind, the chief representative of Godhead, it must leave"
6677,SECT. III.,a deep impression of pain and melancholy on the mind.

6680,SECT. III.,
6681,SECT. III.,The Jupiter of Homer is to be regarded in these four distinct
6682,SECT. III.,capacities:
6683,SECT. III.,
6684,SECT. III.,1. As the depository of the principal remnants of monotheistic and
6685,SECT. III.,providential ideas.
6686,SECT. III.,
6687,SECT. III.,2. As the sovereign lord of meteorological phenomena.
6688,SECT. III.,
6689,SECT. III.,3. As the head of the Olympian community.
6690,SECT. III.,
6691,SECT. III.,"4. As the receptacle and butt of the principal part of such earthly,"
6692,SECT. III.,"sensual, and appetitive elements, as, at the time of Homer,"
6693,SECT. III.,anthropophuism had obtruded into the sphere of deity.
6694,SECT. III.,
6695,SECT. III.,"~_Jupiter, as Providence._~"
6696,SECT. III.,
6697,SECT. III.,There are three modes in which Homer connects Jupiter with the
6698,SECT. III.,functions of Providence.
6699,SECT. III.,
6700,SECT. III.,"1. He procures or presides over the settlement, by deliberation in the"
6701,SECT. III.,"Olympian Court, of great questions connected with the course of human"
6702,SECT. III.,"affairs. In the Court of the Fourth Iliad, and in the Assembly of the"
6703,SECT. III.,"Eighth, he himself takes the initiative; in the Seventh and Twentieth"
6704,SECT. III.,"Books he listens to the proposals of Neptune; in the Twenty-fourth,"
6705,SECT. III.,"Apollo introduces the subject; in the First and Fifth Odyssey, Minerva"
6706,SECT. III.,does the like.
6707,SECT. III.,
6708,SECT. III.,2. He is a kind of synonym for Providence with reference to its common
6709,SECT. III.,"operations, to the duties and rights of man, and to the whole order"
6710,SECT. III.,"of the world. Perhaps there are an hundred, or more, passages of the"
6711,SECT. III.,"poems, where he appears in this manner. But they are all open to this"
6712,SECT. III.,"observation, that his name seems, in most of them, to be used as a mere"
6713,SECT. III.,"formula, and to be a sort of a _caput mortuum_ without the enlivening"
6714,SECT. III.,force of the idea that he is really acting in the manner or upon the
6715,SECT. III.,principle described.
6716,SECT. III.,
6717,SECT. III.,"3. On certain occasions, however, he appears as a supreme God, though"
6718,SECT. III.,"single-handed, and not acting either for or with the Olympian assembly."
6719,SECT. III.,The grandest of these occasions is at the close of the Twenty-fourth
6720,SECT. III.,"Odyssey, where Minerva, stimulated by her own sympathizing keenness,"
6721,SECT. III.,seems to have winked at the passionate inclination of Ulysses to make
6722,SECT. III.,"havock among his ungrateful and rebellious subjects. Jupiter, who"
6723,SECT. III.,"had previously counselled moderation, launches his thunderbolt, and"
6724,SECT. III.,"significantly causes it to fall at the feet of Minerva, who thereupon"
6725,SECT. III.,gives at once the required caution to the exasperated sovereign. Peace
6726,SECT. III.,immediately follows[301].
6727,SECT. III.,
6728,SECT. III.,[301] Od. xxiv. 481. 525-41. 546.
6729,SECT. III.,
6730,SECT. III.,"Jupiter, with some of the substantial, has all the titular appendages"
6731,SECT. III.,of a high supremacy. He is habitually denominated the Father of gods
6732,SECT. III.,and men. He is much more frequently identified with the general
6733,SECT. III.,"government of the world, than is any other deity. He is universally"
6734,SECT. III.,"the ταμίης πολέμοιο. He governs the issue of all human toil, and gives"
6735,SECT. III.,"or withholds success. It is on his floor that the caskets rest, which"
6736,SECT. III.,"contain the varying, but, in the main, sorrowful incidents of human"
6737,SECT. III.,"destiny[302]. He has also this one marked and paramount distinction,"
6738,SECT. III.,"that he does not descend to earth to execute his own behests, but in"
6739,SECT. III.,"general either sends other deities as his organs, to give effect to his"
6740,SECT. III.,"will, or else himself operates from afar, by his power as god of air."
6741,SECT. III.,If however he is more identified with the general idea of Providence
6742,SECT. III.,"than are Apollo and Minerva, it is plain, on the other hand, that his"
6743,SECT. III.,"agency is more external, abstract, and remote; theirs more inward and"
6744,SECT. III.,"personal: especially, the function of moral discipline seems, as we"
6745,SECT. III.,"have already found, to belong to Minerva."
6746,SECT. III.,
6747,SECT. III.,"[302] Il. v. 91. xix. 223. iv. 34. i. 353, 408."
6748,SECT. III.,
6749,SECT. III.,Nägelsbach[303] considers that Jupiter alone can act from a distance:
6750,SECT. III.,"but the prayer of Glaucus to Apollo, followed immediately by the"
6751,SECT. III.,"healing of his wounds, seems to prove the reverse conclusively. Again,"
6752,SECT. III.,Minerva reminds Telemachus that the deity can save even when at a
6753,SECT. III.,distance (Od. iii. 231): we have no authority for absolutely confining
6754,SECT. III.,"this to Jupiter, and none for affixing a limit to the space within"
6755,SECT. III.,"which Apollo or Minerva can act. That Jupiter always acts from far,"
6756,SECT. III.,may be due in part to his representing the tradition of the one God;
6757,SECT. III.,but the argument is also in some degree incidental to the nature of
6758,SECT. III.,"his special and mythological gifts, as god of the atmosphere and its"
6759,SECT. III.,phenomena.
6760,SECT. III.,
6761,SECT. III.,[303] Hom. Theol. Abschn. ii.
6762,SECT. III.,
6763,SECT. III.,"Upon the whole, the marks of affinity to ancient tradition are stronger"
6764,SECT. III.,in the Homeric Minerva and Apollo than in Jupiter. He is the ordinary
6765,SECT. III.,"Providence, but this is an external Providence. He undoubtedly excels"
6766,SECT. III.,"them in force, and in the majesty which accompanies it. But the highest"
6767,SECT. III.,"of the divine prerogatives, of which we have but glimpses indeed in any"
6768,SECT. III.,"of them, are hung more abundantly around these his favoured children,"
6769,SECT. III.,"than around himself. The secret government of the minds of men, the"
6770,SECT. III.,"invisible supremacy over natural laws, the power of unravelling the"
6771,SECT. III.,"future (except perhaps as to the destinies of states), the faculty"
6772,SECT. III.,"of controlling death, are scarcely to be discovered in Jupiter, but"
6773,SECT. III.,are oftener made clearly legible in Apollo or Minerva. Indeed Minerva
6774,SECT. III.,"appears always to have latent claims, which Homer himself could not"
6775,SECT. III.,"fully understand or describe, to the very first place. It is only by"
6776,SECT. III.,"supposing the existence of vague traditions to this effect, that we can"
6777,SECT. III.,"explain such passages as that in which she delights, that Menelaus had"
6778,SECT. III.,prayed to her in preference to any other deity[304];
6779,SECT. III.,
6780,SECT. III.,[304] Il. xvii. 567.
6781,SECT. III.,
6782,SECT. III.,"ὣς φάτο· γήθησεν δὲ θεὰ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη,"
6783,SECT. III.,ὅττι ῥά οἱ πάμπρωτα θεῶν ἠρήσατο πάντων.
6784,SECT. III.,
6785,SECT. III.,This sentiment may be accounted for in two ways. It may be due to
6786,SECT. III.,the vulgar vanity of a merely mythological divinity scuffling for
6787,SECT. III.,precedence. It may be a remnant of the tradition of a wisdom that knew
6788,SECT. III.,no superior. The former cause would be scarcely suitable even to the
6789,SECT. III.,deities of invention in Homer. The latter seems wholly in keeping with
6790,SECT. III.,the character and position of his Minerva.
6791,SECT. III.,
6792,SECT. III.,"It may be asked, in which of the two capacities does Jupiter chiefly"
6793,SECT. III.,"influence the government of the world? is it as the Supreme Deity,"
6794,SECT. III.,acting in the main by his own will and power? or is it as the head of
6795,SECT. III.,"the Olympian community, to whose deliberate decisions he, in a species"
6796,SECT. III.,"of executive capacity, gives effect?"
6797,SECT. III.,
6798,SECT. III.,I think there can be no doubt that the activity of Jupiter is
6799,SECT. III.,principally made available in the latter capacity. Not that the Poet
6800,SECT. III.,"had defined for himself the distinction. But there were two processes,"
6801,SECT. III.,each of which had been actively advancing: the breaking up of Godhead
6802,SECT. III.,"into fragments, which diminished the relative distance between Jupiter"
6803,SECT. III.,and the other Immortals: and the reflection of human ideas of polity
6804,SECT. III.,"upon Olympus, which gave a growing prominence to the element of"
6805,SECT. III.,aristocracy.
6806,SECT. III.,
6807,SECT. III.,"Upon the whole, then, I should say that the traditive ideas of"
6808,SECT. III.,"monotheism, and of a personal Providence represented in the Homeric"
6809,SECT. III.,"Jupiter, are on almost all occasions things of the past. They are like"
6810,SECT. III.,"the old jewels of a family, beautiful and imposing for occasions of"
6811,SECT. III.,"state: but they scarcely enter into his everyday life. Indeed, their"
6812,SECT. III.,"chief effect is the negative one of withdrawing him, on the score of"
6813,SECT. III.,"dignity, from immediate contact with mortals and with their concerns;"
6814,SECT. III.,"and, were it not for his atmospheric prerogatives, this isolated"
6815,SECT. III.,supremacy would carry him into insignificance as compared with a deity
6816,SECT. III.,"like Minerva, who is ever in the view of man, and ever making herself"
6817,SECT. III.,felt both in his mind and in his affairs.
6818,SECT. III.,
6819,SECT. III.,"There are occasions, but they are not very numerous, when, under"
6820,SECT. III.,"the influence of an unwonted zeal, we find Jupiter himself taking a"
6821,SECT. III.,part in the detailed action of the Iliad; his interferences being
6822,SECT. III.,"usually confined to the greater crises or indications, such as the one"
6823,SECT. III.,"mentioned in Il. ii. 353, and such as the occasions when the τάλαντα"
6824,SECT. III.,"are produced. As examples of minor interposition, I may cite his"
6825,SECT. III.,"inspiring Ajax with fear, his launching a thunderbolt in the path of"
6826,SECT. III.,"Diomed, his breaking the bow-string of Teucer, and his advising Hector"
6827,SECT. III.,to avoid an encounter with Agamemnon[305].
6828,SECT. III.,
6829,SECT. III.,[305] Il. xi. 544. viii. 133-6. xv. 463. xi. 181-94.
6830,SECT. III.,
6831,SECT. III.,~_Jupiter as Lord of Air._~
6832,SECT. III.,
6833,SECT. III.,"But the position assigned to him in the mythology of Olympus, which"
6834,SECT. III.,"provides him with the second of his characters, is chosen with great"
6835,SECT. III.,skill. Although at first sight Sea may appear a more substantive and
6836,SECT. III.,"awful power than Air, and Earth a more solid and worthy foundation of"
6837,SECT. III.,"dominion than either, yet consideration must readily show, that as"
6838,SECT. III.,"the king of the atmosphere, Jupiter is possessed of far more prompt,"
6839,SECT. III.,"effective, and above all, universal means of acting upon mankind, than"
6840,SECT. III.,he would have been had the lottery been so arranged as to give him
6841,SECT. III.,either of those other provinces.
6842,SECT. III.,
6843,SECT. III.,The tradition of a Trinity in the Godhead evidently leaves its traces
6844,SECT. III.,on the Greek mythology in the curious fable of the three Kronid
6845,SECT. III.,"brothers. For the lottery of the universe, in which they draw on equal"
6846,SECT. III.,"terms, is not founded upon, but is at variance with, Greek ideas. Those"
6847,SECT. III.,"ideas embodied the system, more or less defined, of primogeniture:"
6848,SECT. III.,"and therefore, had the Olympian system been wholly inventive, the very"
6849,SECT. III.,least it could have assigned to Jupiter would have been a priority
6850,SECT. III.,of choice among the different portions of the universe. This lottery
6851,SECT. III.,is evidently founded upon the idea of an essential equality in those
6852,SECT. III.,who draw. Happily the result is such as to coincide with the order
6853,SECT. III.,of natural precedence: and the value and weight of the three charges
6854,SECT. III.,"is graduated according to the standing of the brothers, though their"
6855,SECT. III.,"abstract equality is so rigidly asserted by Neptune, who declares"
6856,SECT. III.,himself ἰσόμορον καὶ ὁμῇ πεπρωμένον αἴσῃ (Il. xv. 209).
6857,SECT. III.,
6858,SECT. III.,The exclusion of Earth from the lottery is singular: but it appears
6859,SECT. III.,"to have a double justification. In the first place, we must bear in"
6860,SECT. III.,"mind the regularity of its operations, combined with the fact that it"
6861,SECT. III.,"sensibly acts on nothing, but is passive under other agencies, such as"
6862,SECT. III.,"those of Sun, Wind, and Sea. This would have rendered the conception"
6863,SECT. III.,of it as a deity comparatively feeble in the Greek mind. In the second
6864,SECT. III.,"place, it is probable that when the Olympian mythology took its shape,"
6865,SECT. III.,"that province was preoccupied: that the Eastern religions, observing"
6866,SECT. III.,"its jointly passive and productive character, had personified it as"
6867,SECT. III.,feminine. But even this did not content the Greek imagination. The
6868,SECT. III.,conception of the bride of the chief deity was disengaged from brute
6869,SECT. III.,"matter, and uplifted into a divinity having for its office the care and"
6870,SECT. III.,government of a civilized and associated people. The Homeric Juno may
6871,SECT. III.,"almost be defined as the goddess of Greece. There rose up in her place,"
6872,SECT. III.,"like a low mist of evening, from the ground, the comparatively obscure"
6873,SECT. III.,"Homeric Γαῖα, who has no life or function, except in connection with"
6874,SECT. III.,the idea of vengeance to be executed upon the wicked; and this she
6875,SECT. III.,"probably derives from the belief, that the rebel spirits were punished"
6876,SECT. III.,"in the subterranean prisons, of which she was as it were, by physical"
6877,SECT. III.,"laws, the necessary keeper."
6878,SECT. III.,
6879,SECT. III.,"As Lord of the air, Jupiter came to be endowed with a multitude of"
6880,SECT. III.,"active powers the most palpable, and the most replete with at least"
6881,SECT. III.,"outward influence for man. The years are his years, the thunder and"
6882,SECT. III.,"lightning his thunder and lightning, the rain his rain; the rivers, or"
6883,SECT. III.,"the most illustrious among them, the Διϊπετεῖς ποταμοὶ, are his: the"
6884,SECT. III.,"clouds and tempests obey his compelling, the winds blow at his command."
6885,SECT. III.,"The hail and snow come from him[306]: he impels the falling star[307],"
6886,SECT. III.,"and, when he desires a more effective weapon or a more solemn lesson"
6887,SECT. III.,"than usual, he launches the scathing thunderbolt[308]. All signs and"
6888,SECT. III.,"portents whatever, that appear in air, belong primarily to him; as does"
6889,SECT. III.,"the genial sign of the rainbow,"

6905,SECT. III.,
6906,SECT. III.,"But as the tradition of the lottery adorns and strengthens, so"
6907,SECT. III.,in another view it circumscribes him. His sway is unknown in the
6908,SECT. III.,"regions of the dead, where his brother holds the sceptre, as the Ζεὺς"
6909,SECT. III.,"καταχθόνιος[310]. Accordingly, when Hercules is sent to fetch Cerberus,"
6910,SECT. III.,Jupiter obtains for him the aid of Minerva. The more traditive deity

6923,SECT. III.,"Family and Polity. Of this let us now consider so much, as is not more"
6924,SECT. III.,immediately connected with the subject of the divine Polity.
6925,SECT. III.,
6926,SECT. III.,"He is carefully marked out as supreme in the mythological prerogatives,"
6927,SECT. III.,which are for Olympus as the Crown and Sword of State on Earth. He
6928,SECT. III.,is the original owner of the Ægis. To him the gods rise up at their
6929,SECT. III.,"meetings[311]. He is not tied to swear by Styx[312], and invokes no"
6930,SECT. III.,"infernal power to be the sanction of his word, but condescends only to"
6931,SECT. III.,use the symbol of a nod.

6934,SECT. III.,
6935,SECT. III.,[312] Il. i. 524-30. See however xix. 113.
6936,SECT. III.,
6937,SECT. III.,"Of omnipotence, as we understand the word, it would not appear that"
6938,SECT. III.,Homer had any idea. He had however the idea of a being superior in
6939,SECT. III.,"force to all other gods separately, or perhaps even when combined. This"
6940,SECT. III.,"being was Jupiter. But the conception in his mind was a wavering one,"
6941,SECT. III.,"so that, though it was present to him, we cannot say that he embraced"
6942,SECT. III.,"it as a truth. If by some parts of the poems it is supported, by others"
6943,SECT. III.,"it is brought into question or overthrown. As respects Briareus, who"
6944,SECT. III.,"was not a god, his superiority in mere force to Jupiter is expressly"
6945,SECT. III.,declared (Il. i. 404).
6946,SECT. III.,
6947,SECT. III.,"In the Assembly of the Eighth Book, Jupiter loudly proclaims his"
6948,SECT. III.,personal superiority in strength to all the other gods and goddesses
6949,SECT. III.,"combined; and boasts that, while by a golden chain they could not"

6966,SECT. III.,"about to do it, when Briareus came to the rescue, and by his mere"
6967,SECT. III.,appearance reestablished Jupiter in secure supremacy. This legend has a

6988,SECT. III.,"present in the Assembly of the Eighth Book, when Jupiter bragged of"
6989,SECT. III.,his being stronger than them all together. Neither he nor Juno obeyed

6993,SECT. III.,"On the whole, the superiority of Jupiter to any one god is clear,"
6994,SECT. III.,though not immeasurable. His superiority to the whole is doubtful. The
6995,SECT. III.,"point in his favour is, that he never was actually coerced. The point"
6996,SECT. III.,"against him is, that his will seems to give place, and this too on"

7001,SECT. III.,"does not appeal to their sense of right, nor profess to be ruled in his"
7002,SECT. III.,"own proceedings towards them by impartial justice. On the contrary, he"
7003,SECT. III.,"desires the wounded Mars not to sit whining by his side; and, before"
7004,SECT. III.,"ordering Paieon to heal his hurts, makes a distinct declaration,"
7005,SECT. III.,"that had he been the son of any deity other than himself, he should"
7006,SECT. III.,"have been ejected from heaven into a lower place, apparently meaning"
7007,SECT. III.,"the dark and dismal Tartarus, on account of his love of quarrels. A"
7008,SECT. III.,profound attachment to ease and self-enjoyment lies at the root of his
7009,SECT. III.,character. He never disturbs the established order; and he is averse
7010,SECT. III.,"to movement and innovation, come from whence it may. The spirit of"
7011,SECT. III.,"Juno[318], so restless on behalf of Greece, is vexatious to him in"
7012,SECT. III.,"the highest degree: and his love of Troy, if it has reference to any"
7013,SECT. III.,"thing beyond liberality in sacrifices and the descent of Dardanus,"
7014,SECT. III.,may perhaps be referred to its representing the stereotyped form of
7015,SECT. III.,society. It is probably on account of this indolence of temperament
7016,SECT. III.,"that, when he has brought Hector and the Trojans as far as the"
7017,SECT. III.,"Ships, he feels he has had enough for the moment of the spectacle of"
7018,SECT. III.,blood; and accordingly he turns his eyes over Thrace and the country
7019,SECT. III.,"of the Mysians, the Hippemolgians, and the righteous and therefore"
7020,SECT. III.,"presumably peaceful Abii[319]. Wearied with the perpetual din, he finds"
7021,SECT. III.,"satisfaction in a change of prospect; but at another time, refreshed"
7022,SECT. III.,"as we may suppose, he coolly states that he shall enjoy a sight of the"

7038,SECT. III.,
7039,SECT. III.,"It was so deeply implanted in him, that it entered into his personal"
7040,SECT. III.,conduct even when he was not in immediate contact with the Olympian
7041,SECT. III.,"body. For example, in the Sixteenth Iliad, Jupiter debates with himself"
7042,SECT. III.,whether he shall save Sarpedon from death by the hand of Patroclus.

7058,SECT. III.,of head of the community of Immortals.
7059,SECT. III.,
7060,SECT. III.,"Hence it is that he is the steward of sovereignty, and the champion of"
7061,SECT. III.,"social rights. All princes and rulers hold from him, and administer"
7062,SECT. III.,justice under his authority. He gave their sceptre to the family of
7063,SECT. III.,"Pelops: even the heralds are his agents, Διὸς ἄγγελοι, and act in his"
7064,SECT. III.,name.
7065,SECT. III.,
7066,SECT. III.,"On Olympus it falls to him in this capacity, not only to conduct and"
7067,SECT. III.,"superintend the proceedings of the whole body of Immortals, as a"
7068,SECT. III.,"body, but to exercise a very large influence over their relations"
7069,SECT. III.,"individually with men, and with one another. The Sun carries to Jupiter"
7070,SECT. III.,"in full court, as head of the body, his complaint against the crew"
7071,SECT. III.,"of Ulysses, and Jupiter at once undertakes to avenge it[322]. Juno,"
7072,SECT. III.,"again, appeals to him on the conduct of Mars[323], and he permits her"
7073,SECT. III.,"to let loose Minerva on him. Mars, when wounded, goes to Jupiter with"
7074,SECT. III.,"his complaint[324], and Diana also, when requested, makes him privy to"
7075,SECT. III.,"hers, after she has taken her seat upon his knee[325]. When any two"
7076,SECT. III.,"deities are in any manner at issue or in collision, or when any of the"
7077,SECT. III.,"more dependent gods have a quarrel with men, then Jupiter finds his"
7078,SECT. III.,"place as the natural arbiter, and from this source he obtains great"
7079,SECT. III.,support for his power. The surest of all its guarantees is indeed found
7080,SECT. III.,"in the skill with which, by making the will of Olympus his own, he"
7081,SECT. III.,makes his own will irresistible.

7091,SECT. III.,"Thus then the Jupiter of Homer has varied elements of grandeur,"
7092,SECT. III.,"traditional, physical, and political. Something also accrues to him"
7093,SECT. III.,by the sheer necessity of the metaphysical order. Wherever the mind
7094,SECT. III.,"demands a personal origin or cause, he alone can offer to supply"
7095,SECT. III.,"its want. He still continues to represent, in a certain degree, the"
7096,SECT. III.,principle of unity; and he derives strength from that principle. Nor
7097,SECT. III.,does the solid might of Destiny interfere with his claims to the same
7098,SECT. III.,"extent in Homer, as it does in the later Greek poetry."
7099,SECT. III.,
7100,SECT. III.,"Thus equipped with august prerogatives, the Jupiter of Homer is"
7101,SECT. III.,"evidently, to the popular view, the most sublime object in the Olympian"
7102,SECT. III.,mythology. His breadth and grandeur of dimension commended him to the
7103,SECT. III.,"admiring favour of the Greek artist, who made it his supreme effort"
7104,SECT. III.,to embody the conception of the Sovereign of Olympus: and we may judge
7105,SECT. III.,"of his elevation in the public apprehension over all other deities, by"
7106,SECT. III.,"the greater sublimity of the material forms, in which the idea of his"
7107,SECT. III.,divinity has been enshrined.
7108,SECT. III.,
7109,SECT. III.,"But the figure of Jupiter, as it is the principal, so it is also the"
7110,SECT. III.,"most anomalous, in the whole Homeric assemblage. Although he is, and"
7111,SECT. III.,"even because he is, the depository of so many among the most primitive"
7112,SECT. III.,"and venerable ideas, he becomes also the butt alike of the infirmity,"
7113,SECT. III.,"and the wantonness, and insolence of human thought, in the alterative"
7114,SECT. III.,operations which it continually prosecutes upon the ancient and pure
7115,SECT. III.,"idea of Godhead. Hence not only in his character, as in other cases,"
7116,SECT. III.,"does the inventive power everywhere sap, corrode, invade, and curtail"
7117,SECT. III.,"the ancient traditionary conception of divine truths, but it is in"
7118,SECT. III.,"him that we find both systems culminating at once, both exhibiting"
7119,SECT. III.,"in him, raised to the highest power, their separate and discordant"
7120,SECT. III.,characteristics.
7121,SECT. III.,
7122,SECT. III.,From one point of view Jupiter is the most sublime of all the deities
7123,SECT. III.,"of Homer, because he is the first personal source and origin of life,"
7124,SECT. III.,"the father of gods and men, the supreme manifestation of Power and"
7125,SECT. III.,"knowledge, the principal, though imperfect living representation of a"
7126,SECT. III.,Providence and Governor of the world.
7127,SECT. III.,
7128,SECT. III.,"Regarded from another point of view, as we see disclosed the large"
7129,SECT. III.,"intrusion of the human and carnal element into the ethereal sphere, the"
7130,SECT. III.,character of Jupiter becomes the most repulsive in the whole circle of
7131,SECT. III.,"Olympian life[326]. The emancipation from truth, the self-abandonment"
7132,SECT. III.,"to gross passion, the constant breach of the laws he administers, are"
7133,SECT. III.,"more conspicuous in the chief god than in any of the subordinate gods,"
7134,SECT. III.,and are more offensive in proportion to the majesty with which they are
7135,SECT. III.,unnaturally associated.

7143,SECT. III.,"of the Immortals, rises to its climax, as was to be expected, in"
7144,SECT. III.,"Jupiter. The idea of the Supreme, or at least by far the First being"
7145,SECT. III.,"of the universe, had not yet, indeed, descended so low as it did"
7146,SECT. III.,"in after-times, when it was even associated with lusts contrary to"
7147,SECT. III.,nature. Of these there is no trace in Homer. But the law which governs
7148,SECT. III.,"the relation of sex, as it exists among men, was utterly relaxed and"
7149,SECT. III.,"disorganized for him. In the first place, monogamy, established for all"
7150,SECT. III.,"Greeks, for the chief god of Greece became polygamy; and in the second,"
7151,SECT. III.,marriage was no bar against incessant adultery.
7152,SECT. III.,
7153,SECT. III.,"A certain distinction between the wives, and the mere paramours, of"
7154,SECT. III.,"Jupiter is clearly traceable in Homer. Latona, for instance, is a wife,"

7167,SECT. III.,in the vengeance inflicted on Niobe and her family by the children of
7168,SECT. III.,"Latona[328]. Again, as he is not a personal providence, and does not"
7169,SECT. III.,"take charge of the destiny or guide the conduct of individuals, nor"
7170,SECT. III.,"ever touches the depths of human nature, so he has at once the largest"

7178,SECT. III.,"thrice deluded by the cunning of Juno[329], who not only outwits him,"

7180,SECT. III.,moves (λάθρη) on the plain of Troy unseen by him[330]. He ought to be

7204,SECT. III.,his sacrifices. Jupiter is the great propounder of the animal view of
7205,SECT. III.,"that subject: and accordingly in the Odyssey[333], Minerva pleads the"
7206,SECT. III.,"case of Ulysses very much on this ground before Jupiter, though, in all"
7207,SECT. III.,"her intercourse with that chief, there is no sign of her valuing the"
7208,SECT. III.,"offerings on her own account. In every point of sensual susceptibility,"

7231,SECT. III.,keep aloof from trouble and responsibility for human affairs. The same
7232,SECT. III.,sentiment appears in the determination of Neptune and Apollo not to
7233,SECT. III.,"quarrel on account of mortals. But in the case of Jupiter, the selfish"

7279,SECT. III.,"variance with the constant dignity and self-command, which mark the"
7280,SECT. III.,deportment of the great traditive deities. Her whole activity in the

7298,SECT. III.,
7299,SECT. III.,[338] Hence the Ἐρινύες are in conflict with her in Il. xix. 418. On

7302,SECT. III.,"In the Iliad, of which the martial movement is appropriate to her,"
7303,SECT. III.,and where the Greek nationality is placed in sharp contrast with a
7304,SECT. III.,"foreign one, she plays a great part, is ever alert and at work, and"
7305,SECT. III.,"contributes mainly to the progress of the action. But in the Odyssey,"
7306,SECT. III.,"a poem more simply theistic and ethical, and without any opposition"
7307,SECT. III.,"of nationalities, she has no share in the action, and may be said"
7308,SECT. III.,practically to disappear from view. To appreciate the force of this
7309,SECT. III.,"circumstance, we must contrast it with Homer’s treatment of another"
7310,SECT. III.,"deity, inferior to her in the Olympian community. The three greatest"
7311,SECT. III.,"deities, among those who embody much of primitive tradition, are"
7312,SECT. III.,"Jupiter, Minerva, and Apollo. Of these, Jupiter, in the character of"
7313,SECT. III.,"Providence, has everywhere a place ready made for him; Minerva, as"
7314,SECT. III.,"the guide and protectress of Ulysses, has ample opportunities for her"
7315,SECT. III.,activity; but it is not so with Apollo: and in consequence Homer has
7316,SECT. III.,"been careful to supply in the poem points of contact with him, by the"
7317,SECT. III.,"introduction of Theoclymenus, and of the grand imagery of the second"
7318,SECT. III.,"sight, which is his gift; by fixing the critical day at the new moon,"
7319,SECT. III.,"which was sacred to him, and by causing the crisis to turn upon the"
7320,SECT. III.,"bow, his famous weapon: as though these three, Jupiter, Minerva, and"
7321,SECT. III.,"Apollo, were the universal, permanent, and indispensable deities; but"
7322,SECT. III.,"the others occasional, and to be used according to circumstances. Juno"
7323,SECT. III.,"has no such place or office provided for her in the Odyssey, as they"
7324,SECT. III.,have.
7325,SECT. III.,
7326,SECT. III.,"There is yet another mark adhering to Juno, which clearly separates"
7327,SECT. III.,between her and the Homeric deities of strongly marked traditional
7328,SECT. III.,"character: namely, that she was not exempt from the touch of defeat and"
7329,SECT. III.,"dishonour. For, in the course of her long feud with Hercules, that hero"
7330,SECT. III.,"wounded her with an arrow in the left breast, and caused her to suffer"
7331,SECT. III.,"desperate pain[339]. Again, she was ignominiously punished by Jupiter;"
7332,SECT. III.,"who suspended her with her hands in chains, and with anvils hanging"
7333,SECT. III.,from her feet[340].

7338,SECT. III.,
7339,SECT. III.,~_Her intense nationality._~
7340,SECT. III.,
7341,SECT. III.,Her strong and profound Greek nationality has obtained for her the
7342,SECT. III.,name of Argeian Juno. The fervour of this nationality is most signally
7343,SECT. III.,"exemplified in the passage where Jupiter tells her, that she regards"
7344,SECT. III.,"the Greeks as her children[341]; and again, where she lets us know"
7345,SECT. III.,that it was she[342] who collected the armament against Troy. She
7346,SECT. III.,conducts Agamemnon the head of the Greek nation safely on the sea[343];
7347,SECT. III.,and carries Jason through the Πλαγκταί[344]. This is the vivifying
7348,SECT. III.,"idea of her whole character, and fills it with energy, vigilance,"
7349,SECT. III.,"determination, and perseverance. Her hatred of Hercules cannot have"
7350,SECT. III.,"been owing to conjugal jealousy, with which she is not troubled in"
7351,SECT. III.,"Homer, for Jupiter recites his conquests in addressing her on Ida;"
7352,SECT. III.,"indeed, had she been liable to this emotion, it must, from the frequent"
7353,SECT. III.,"recurrence of its occasions, have supplied the main thread of her"
7354,SECT. III.,feeling and action. It was her identification in soul with the Perseid
7355,SECT. III.,"dynasty, the legitimate representative, in its own day, of the Hellenic"
7356,SECT. III.,"race, and in occupation of its sovereign seat, that made her filch, on"
7357,SECT. III.,"behalf of Eurystheus, the effect of the promise intended by Jupiter"
7358,SECT. III.,"for Hercules, and that engaged her afterwards in a constant struggle"
7359,SECT. III.,"to bear down that elastic hero, whose high personal gifts still"
7360,SECT. III.,"threatened to eclipse his royal relative and competitor. So again,"
7361,SECT. III.,"unlike Minerva[345], even while seeking to operate through Trojans,"
7362,SECT. III.,she studiously avoids contact with them. Minerva is sent as agent to
7363,SECT. III.,"Pandarus[346]; but this is on the suggestion of Juno. In truth, this"
7364,SECT. III.,"intensely national stamp localizes the divinity of Juno, and, being"
7365,SECT. III.,"counteracted by no other sign, fixes on her the note both of invention,"
7366,SECT. III.,and of Greek invention.

7391,SECT. III.,"she suggests action to Minerva, and it follows[349]: in the First Book,"
7392,SECT. III.,"Juno is even said to send her, though by another arrangement the Poet"
7393,SECT. III.,has provided against attaching inferiority to that goddess[350]. It
7394,SECT. III.,"may be that in her seeming to employ Minerva, as in so many of her"
7395,SECT. III.,"highest functions, she is reflecting one of the high prerogatives of"
7396,SECT. III.,Jupiter. Certain it is that by the side of her ceaseless and passionate
7397,SECT. III.,"activity, even Minerva appears, except on the battle-field, to play,"
7398,SECT. III.,"in the Iliad, a part secondary to hers. She was so powerful[351], not"
7399,SECT. III.,"only as to form one of the great trine rebellion against Jupiter, which"
7400,SECT. III.,"so nearly dethroned him, but as to make him feel greatly relieved and"
7401,SECT. III.,"rejoiced, in his differences with Neptune, when she promises to side"
7402,SECT. III.,"with him[352]: ‘with your aid,’ so thinks Jupiter, ‘he will easily"
7403,SECT. III.,"be kept in order, and will have to act as _we_ could wish.’ She is"
7404,SECT. III.,"certainly the most bold, untiring, zealous, and effective assistant to"

7422,SECT. III.,"displays itself in various forms, both over deities, and over animate"
7423,SECT. III.,"and inanimate nature. In some of these particularly, her proceedings"
7424,SECT. III.,seem to be a reflected image of her husband’s. Iris[354] is not only
7425,SECT. III.,"his messenger, but her’s. She not only orders the Winds, but she sends"
7426,SECT. III.,"the Sun to his setting[355], in spite of his reluctance. When, in"
7427,SECT. III.,"her indignation at the boast of Hector, she rocks on her throne, she"
7428,SECT. III.,shakes Olympus[356]. She endows the deathless horses of Achilles with
7429,SECT. III.,"a voice[357]. And conjoined with Minerva, she thunders in honour of"
7430,SECT. III.,"Agamemnon when just armed. Except the case of the horse, all these"

7445,SECT. III.,the daughters of Pandarus were supplied by various goddesses with
7446,SECT. III.,"various qualities and gifts. Diana gave them size, Juno gave them εἶδος"
7447,SECT. III.,καὶ πινυτήν. We should rather have expected the last to come from
7448,SECT. III.,"Minerva: but she endowed them with ἔργα or industrial skill, so that"
7449,SECT. III.,her dignity has been in another way provided for. But if the lines are
7450,SECT. III.,"genuine, then in the capacity of Juno to confer the gift of πινυτὴ"
7451,SECT. III.,"or prudence, we see a point of contact between her powerful but more"
7452,SECT. III.,"limited, and Minerva’s larger character[359]."

7456,SECT. III.,[359] Od. xx. 70-2.
7457,SECT. III.,
7458,SECT. III.,The full idea of her mind is in fact contained in the union of great
7459,SECT. III.,"astuteness with her self-command, force, and courage: which, in effect,"
7460,SECT. III.,makes it the reflection of the genius of the Greeks when deprived of
7461,SECT. III.,its moral element: and places it in very near correspondence with that
7462,SECT. III.,"of the Phœnicians, who are like Greeks, somewhat seriously maimed in"
7463,SECT. III.,that one great department. This full idea is exhibited on two great
7464,SECT. III.,"occasions. Once when she outwits Jupiter, by fastening him with an"
7465,SECT. III.,"oath to his promise, and then, hastening one birth, and by her command"
7466,SECT. III.,"over the Eilithuiæ retarding another, proceeds to make Eurystheus"
7467,SECT. III.,the recipient of what Jupiter had intended for another less remote
7468,SECT. III.,"descendant of his own. Again, in the Fourteenth Iliad, by a daring"
7469,SECT. III.,"combination, she hoaxes Venus to obtain her capital charm, induces"
7470,SECT. III.,"Sleep by a bribe to undertake an almost desperate enterprise, and then,"
7471,SECT. III.,though on account of his sentiments towards Troy she felt disgust (Il.
7472,SECT. III.,"xiv. 158) as she looked upon Jupiter, enslaves him for the time through"
7473,SECT. III.,"a passion of which she is not herself the slave, but which she uses as"
7474,SECT. III.,"her instrument for a great end of policy. She is, in short, a great,"
7475,SECT. III.,"fervid, unscrupulous, and most able Greek patriot, exhibiting little"
7476,SECT. III.,"of divine ingredients, but gifted with a marked and powerful human"
7477,SECT. III.,individuality.
7478,SECT. III.,
7479,SECT. III.,"It may be worth while to observe in passing, an indication as to the"
7480,SECT. III.,limited powers of locomotion which Homer ascribed to his deities. The
7481,SECT. III.,"horses of Juno, when she drives, cover at each step a space as great"
7482,SECT. III.,as the human eye can command looking along the sea. But when she has
7483,SECT. III.,"the two operations to perform on the same day, one upon the mother of"
7484,SECT. III.,"Eurystheus, and the other on the mother of Hercules, she attends to the"
7485,SECT. III.,"first in her own person, and apparently manages the other by command"
7486,SECT. III.,"given to the Eilithuiæ (Il. xix. 119). If so, then she was evidently in"
7487,SECT. III.,the Poet’s mind subject to the laws of space and corporal presence: and
7488,SECT. III.,his figure of the horse’s spring was one on which he would not rely for
7489,SECT. III.,the management of an important piece of business.
7490,SECT. III.,
7491,SECT. III.,"There are three places, and three only, in the poems, which could"
7492,SECT. III.,connect Juno with the Trojans. One is the Judgment of Paris (Il. xxiv.
7493,SECT. III.,29). The others are no more than verbal only. Hector swears by Jupiter
7494,SECT. III.,"“the loud thundering husband of Here[360].” And again, he wishes he"
7495,SECT. III.,"had as certainly Jupiter for his father, and Juno for his mother[361],"
7496,SECT. III.,as he is certain that the day will bring disaster to the Greeks. We
7497,SECT. III.,"cannot, then, say that she was absolutely unknown to the Trojans in her"
7498,SECT. III.,"Hellenic form, while they may have been more familiar with her eastern"
7499,SECT. III.,"prototypes[362]. It does not, however, follow, that she was a deity of"
7500,SECT. III.,established worship among them. There is no notice of any institution
7501,SECT. III.,"or act of religion on the one side, or of care on the other, between"
7502,SECT. III.,her and any member of their race. In the mention of her among the
7503,SECT. III.,"Trojans, we may perhaps have an instance of the very common tendency of"
7504,SECT. III.,"the heathen nations to adopt, by sympathy as it were, deities from one"
7505,SECT. III.,"another; independently of all positive causes, such as migration, or"
7506,SECT. III.,ethnical or political connection.

7514,SECT. III.,~_Her mythological origin._~
7515,SECT. III.,
7516,SECT. III.,"The origin of Juno, which would thus on many grounds appear to have"
7517,SECT. III.,"been Hellenic, appears to be referable to the principle, which I have"
7518,SECT. III.,"called œconomy, and under which the relations of deities were thrown"
7519,SECT. III.,"into the known forms of the human family. This process, according to"
7520,SECT. III.,"the symmetrical and logical turn of the Greek mind, began when it was"
7521,SECT. III.,"needed for its purpose, and stopped when it had done its work. Gods,"
7522,SECT. III.,"that were to generate or rear other gods, were coupled; and partners"
7523,SECT. III.,"were supplied by simple reflection of the character of the male,"
7524,SECT. III.,where there was no Idea or Power ready for impersonation that would
7525,SECT. III.,"serve the turn. Thus, Ῥέα, Earth or Matter, found a suitable mate"
7526,SECT. III.,"for Κρόνος, or Time. But to make a match for Oceanus, his own mere"
7527,SECT. III.,"reflected image, or feminine, was called into being under the name"
7528,SECT. III.,"of Tethys. Such was, but only after the time of Homer, Amphitrite"
7529,SECT. III.,"for Neptune, and Proserpine for Hades. In Homer the latter is more,"
7530,SECT. III.,and the former less than this. It was by nothing less than an entire
7531,SECT. III.,"metamorphosis, that the Greek Juno was educed from, or substituted for,"
7532,SECT. III.,some old deification of the Earth. She is much more a creation than
7533,SECT. III.,"an adaptation. What she really represents in Olympus, is supernatural"
7534,SECT. III.,"wifehood; of which the common mark is, the want of positive and"
7535,SECT. III.,distinct attributes in the goddess. With this may be combined a
7536,SECT. III.,"negative sign not less pregnant with evidence; namely, the derivation"
7537,SECT. III.,and secondary handling of the prerogatives of the husband. The case of
7538,SECT. III.,Juno is clear and strong under both heads. Her grandeur arises from her
7539,SECT. III.,"being clothed in the reflected rays of her husband’s supremacy, like"
7540,SECT. III.,Achilles in the flash of the Ægis. But positive divine function she has
7541,SECT. III.,"none whatever, except the slender one of presiding over maternity by"
7542,SECT. III.,"her own agency, and by that of her figurative daughters, the Eilithuiæ."
7543,SECT. III.,"She is, when we contemplate her critically, the goddess of motherhood"
7544,SECT. III.,"and of nothing else. And in truth, as the fire made Vulcan, and war"
7545,SECT. III.,"made Mars, her mythological children, so motherhood made Juno, and is"
7546,SECT. III.,"her type in actual nature. She became a goddess, to give effect to the"
7547,SECT. III.,"principle of œconomy, to bring the children of Jupiter into the world,"
7548,SECT. III.,"to enable man, in short, to construct that Olympian order, which he was"
7549,SECT. III.,"to worship. Having been thus conceived, she assumed high powers and"
7550,SECT. III.,"dignities in right of her husband, whose sister she was fabled to be,"
7551,SECT. III.,"upon becoming also his wife, because either logical instinct, or the"
7552,SECT. III.,ancient traditions of our race rendered it a necessity for the Greeks
7553,SECT. III.,"to derive the divine, as well as the human, family from a single pair."
7554,SECT. III.,
7555,SECT. III.,"However strictly Hellenic may have been the position of Juno, we must"
7556,SECT. III.,"reckon her as the sister of Jupiter to have been worshipped, in Homer’s"
7557,SECT. III.,"time, from beyond the memory of man. For she carries upon her no token,"
7558,SECT. III.,"which can entitle us to assign to her a recent origin. Recent, I mean,"
7559,SECT. III.,in her Hellenic form: apart from the fact that she was not conceived
7560,SECT. III.,"by the Greeks, so to speak, out of nothing; and that she, in common"
7561,SECT. III.,"with many other deities, represents the Greek remodelling, in this"
7562,SECT. III.,"case peculiarly searching and complete, of eastern traditions. The"
7563,SECT. III.,"representation in theology of the female principle was eastern, and,"
7564,SECT. III.,"as we have seen, even Jewish. Had Juno been simply adopted, she would"
7565,SECT. III.,"probably have been an elemental power, corresponding with Earth in the"
7566,SECT. III.,"visible creation. In lieu of this she became Queen of Olympus, and, in"
7567,SECT. III.,"relation to men, goddess of Greece. Earth remains, in Homer, almost"
7568,SECT. III.,unvivified in consequence. But it may have been on account of this
7569,SECT. III.,"affinity, as well as of her relation to Jupiter, that she has been so"
7570,SECT. III.,liberally endowed with power over nature.

7574,SECT. III.,~_The Neptune of Homer._~
7575,SECT. III.,
7576,SECT. III.,"Neptune is one of three sons of Κρόνος and Ῥέα, and comes next to"
7577,SECT. III.,Jupiter in order of birth. In the Fifteenth Iliad he claims an equality
7578,SECT. III.,"of rank, and avers that the distribution of sovereignties among the"
7579,SECT. III.,"three brothers was made by lot. The Sea is his, the Shades are subject"
7580,SECT. III.,"to Aides, Jupiter has the Heaven and Air; Earth and Olympus are"
7581,SECT. III.,"common to them all. Wherefore, says Neptune, I am no mere satellite"
7582,SECT. III.,"of Jupiter: great as he is, let him rest content with his own share;"
7583,SECT. III.,"and if he wants somebody to command, let him command his own sons"
7584,SECT. III.,and daughters. Perhaps there may here be conveyed a taunt at Jupiter
7585,SECT. III.,with respect to the independent and adverse policy of Minerva. This
7586,SECT. III.,very curious speech is delivered by Neptune in reply to the command
7587,SECT. III.,"of Jupiter, that he should leave the field of battle before Troy,"
7588,SECT. III.,"which was backed by threats. Iris, the messenger, who hears him, in"
7589,SECT. III.,her reply founds the superiority of Jupiter on his seniority only.
7590,SECT. III.,To this Neptune yields: but reserves his right of resentment if
7591,SECT. III.,Jupiter should spare Troy[363]. Nor does Jupiter send down Apollo to
7592,SECT. III.,"encourage the Trojans, until Neptune has actually retired: he then"
7593,SECT. III.,expresses great satisfaction at the withdrawal of Neptune without a
7594,SECT. III.,"battle between them, which would have been heard and felt in Tartarus;"
7595,SECT. III.,"possibly implying that Neptune would have been hurled into it[364], but"

7605,SECT. III.,
7606,SECT. III.,We have now clearly enough before us the very singular combination of
7607,SECT. III.,"ideas that entered into the conception of the Homeric Neptune, and we"
7608,SECT. III.,"may pronounce, with tolerable confidence, upon the manner in which each"
7609,SECT. III.,one of them acquired its place there. They are these:
7610,SECT. III.,
7611,SECT. III.,"1. As one of the trine brotherhood, who are jointly possessed of the"
7612,SECT. III.,"highest power over the regions of creation, he is part-representative"
7613,SECT. III.,of the primeval tradition respecting the Divine Nature and Persons.
7614,SECT. III.,
7615,SECT. III.,"2. As god of the Sea, he provides an impersonation to take charge of"
7616,SECT. III.,one of the great domains of external nature.
7617,SECT. III.,
7618,SECT. III.,"3. As the eldest and strongest, next to Jupiter, of the Immortal"
7619,SECT. III.,"family, he represents the nucleus of rivalry and material, or"
7620,SECT. III.,"main-force, opposition to the head of the Olympian family."
7621,SECT. III.,
7622,SECT. III.,~_His traits chiefly mythological._~
7623,SECT. III.,
7624,SECT. III.,"With respect to the first, the proposition itself seems to contain"
7625,SECT. III.,nearly all that can be said to belong to Neptune in right of primitive
7626,SECT. III.,"tradition, except indeed as to certain stray relics. One of these"
7627,SECT. III.,"seems to hang about him, in the form of an extraordinary respect"
7628,SECT. III.,paid to him by the children of Jupiter. Apollo is restrained by
7629,SECT. III.,this feeling (αἰδὼς) from coming to blows with him[366]: a similar
7630,SECT. III.,"sentiment restrains Minerva, not only from appearing to Ulysses in"
7631,SECT. III.,"her own Phæacian ἄλσος[367], but even, as she says, from assisting"
7632,SECT. III.,him at all during his previous adventures[368]. But this is all. The
7633,SECT. III.,"prerogatives which are so conspicuous in Apollo and Minerva, and which"
7634,SECT. III.,establish their origin as something set higher than the lust of pure
7635,SECT. III.,"human invention, are but rarely and slightly discernible in Neptune. In"
7636,SECT. III.,"simple strength he stands with Homer next to Jupiter, for to no other"
7637,SECT. III.,deity would Jupiter have paid the compliment of declaring it a serious
7638,SECT. III.,matter to coerce him. But there is no sign of intellectual or moral
7639,SECT. III.,elevation about him. Of the former we may judge from his speeches; for
7640,SECT. III.,the speeches of gods are in Homer nearly as characteristic as those of
7641,SECT. III.,"heroes. As to the latter, his numerous human children show that he did"
7642,SECT. III.,not rise above the mythological standard; and his implacable resentment
7643,SECT. III.,against Ulysses was occasioned by a retribution that the monster
7644,SECT. III.,"Polyphemus had received, not only just in itself, but even relatively"
7645,SECT. III.,slight.

7653,SECT. III.,It does not appear that prayer is addressed to him except in connection
7654,SECT. III.,"with particular places, or in virtue of special titles; as when"
7655,SECT. III.,"the Neleids, his descendants, offer sacrifice to him on the Pylian"
7656,SECT. III.,"shore[369], or the Phæacians[370] seek to avert threatened disaster, or"
7657,SECT. III.,when Polyphemus his son roars to him for help[371]. The sacrifices to
7658,SECT. III.,"him have apparently a local character: at Onchestus is his ἄλσος[372],"
7659,SECT. III.,and Juno appeals to him in the name of the offerings made to him by the
7660,SECT. III.,Greeks at Helice and Ægæ[373]. The Envoys of the Ninth Iliad pray to
7661,SECT. III.,him for the success of their enterprise; but it is while their mission
7662,SECT. III.,is leading them along the sea-beach[374]. He can assume the form of
7663,SECT. III.,"a man; can carry off his friends in vapour, or lift them through the"
7664,SECT. III.,"air[375]; can inspire fire and vigour into heroes, yet this is done"
7665,SECT. III.,"only through a sensible medium, namely, by a stroke of his staff[376]."
7666,SECT. III.,"He blunts, too, the point of an hostile spear[377]. But none of these"
7667,SECT. III.,operations are of the highest order of power. And when Polyphemus
7668,SECT. III.,"faintly expresses the idea that Neptune can restore his eye, (which"
7669,SECT. III.,"however he does not ask in prayer,) Ulysses taunts him in reply with"
7670,SECT. III.,"it as an undoubted certainty, that the god can do no such thing."
7671,SECT. III.,With this we may contrast the remarkable bodily changes operated by
7672,SECT. III.,Minerva upon Ulysses: they do not indeed involve the precise point of
7673,SECT. III.,restoring a destroyed member; but they are far beyond anything which
7674,SECT. III.,Homer has ascribed to his Neptune. Nor does the Poet ever speak of any
7675,SECT. III.,operation of this kind as exceeding the power of Minerva; who enjoyed
7676,SECT. III.,"in a larger form, and by a general title, something like that power of"
7677,SECT. III.,"transformation, which was the special gift and function of Circe and"
7678,SECT. III.,"the Sirens. The discussion of the prerogatives of that half-sorceress,"
7679,SECT. III.,"half-goddess, will throw some further light upon the rank of Neptune."

7714,SECT. III.,"has been provided in the person of Nereus, who is the centre of the"
7715,SECT. III.,"submarine court, and who appears never to quit the depths. Nereus is"

7721,SECT. III.,"does, from rocks upon the coast[379]: and he threatens to overwhelm"
7722,SECT. III.,the Phæacian city by this means[380]. In conjunction with his power
7723,SECT. III.,"over the sea, he can let loose the winds, and darken the sky. On the"

7739,SECT. III.,place it in any clear relation to the other traditions respecting him.
7740,SECT. III.,"He has, again, a peculiar relation to the horse, for though a sea-god,"
7741,SECT. III.,"he employs the animal to transport him to Troas; and it was he, who"
7742,SECT. III.,"presented Xanthus and Balius to Peleus[381]. Again, he, in conjunction"

7754,SECT. III.,this peculiar interest? It is difficult to conceive the aim of the Poet
7755,SECT. III.,in this place. Some have suggested the comic effect[384] which he has
7756,SECT. III.,"produced by putting the petition in the mouth of Neptune, whose mere"

7789,SECT. III.,"that which is recounted[386] in the story of Eumæus. We may notice,"
7790,SECT. III.,"too, that in the Iliad, he does not particularly love the Greeks,"
7791,SECT. III.,"but simply hates the Trojans. He, with Jupiter, we are told, loved"
7792,SECT. III.,"Antilochus[387]. Jupiter, no doubt, because he had a regard for him as"

7795,SECT. III.,"abode in the East, far away from his own domain. He is absent from the"

7820,SECT. III.,"rivulets of tradition, some of the most curious connect themselves with"
7821,SECT. III.,"the name of Neptune, who was, in his mythological character, prepared"
7822,SECT. III.,to be its recipient: for in that character he was near to Jupiter
7823,SECT. III.,"in strength, while his brotherly relation by no means implied any"

7873,SECT. III.,"[394] Il. xiv. 274, 9."
7874,SECT. III.,
7875,SECT. III.,But we have one yet more pointed passage for the establishment of this
7876,SECT. III.,"strange relationship. In the νεκυΐα of the Eleventh Odyssey, Ulysses"
7877,SECT. III.,"sees, among other Shades, Iphimedea, the wife of Aloeus, who bore to"
7878,SECT. III.,"Neptune two children[395], Otus and Ephialtes; hugest of all creatures"
7879,SECT. III.,"upon earth, and also most beautiful, after Orion. They, the sons of"
7880,SECT. III.,"Neptune, while yet children, threatened war against Olympus, and"
7881,SECT. III.,"planned the piling of the mountains: but Apollo slew them. Thus this,"
7882,SECT. III.,the most characteristic of all the traditions in Homer relating to
7883,SECT. III.,"the Evil One, hangs upon the person of Neptune, doubtless because his"
7884,SECT. III.,mythological place best fitted him for the point of junction. It must
7885,SECT. III.,"be observed, that Homer has, in bringing these young giants before"
7886,SECT. III.,"us, used a somewhat artificial arrangement. He does not place them in"
7887,SECT. III.,"the realm of Aides and Persephone, though he describes them to us, in"
7888,SECT. III.,"connection with the figures in that gloomy scene, as the children of"
7889,SECT. III.,"Iphimedea, who appears there in the first or feminine division. That he"
7890,SECT. III.,does not bring them before us in conjunction with Tityus and the other
7891,SECT. III.,"sufferers of that region, can only be because he did not intend them to"
7892,SECT. III.,"be understood as belonging to it: and it is clear, therefore, that he"
7893,SECT. III.,"means us to conceive of them as having their abode in Tartarus, among"
7894,SECT. III.,"the Titans, doubtless by the side of Eurymedon and his followers."
7895,SECT. III.,
7896,SECT. III.,[395] Od. xi. 505-20.
7897,SECT. III.,
7898,SECT. III.,"We may perceive with peculiar clearness, in the case of Neptune, the"
7899,SECT. III.,distinction between the elevated prerogatives of such a deity within
7900,SECT. III.,"his own province, and his comparative insignificance beyond it. When"
7901,SECT. III.,"he traverses the sea, it exults to open a path for him, and the huge"
7902,SECT. III.,creatures from its depths sport along his wake. Such is its sympathy
7903,SECT. III.,"with him, that when he is exciting the Greeks to war, it too boils"
7904,SECT. III.,and foams upon the shore of the Hellespont. And not only is maritime
7905,SECT. III.,"nature thus at his feet, but he has the gift of vision almost without"
7906,SECT. III.,"limit of space, and of knowledge of coming events, so long as they are"
7907,SECT. III.,maritime. He who knows nothing of the woes of his son Polyphemus till
7908,SECT. III.,"he is invoked from the sea-shore, yet can discern Ulysses on his raft"
7909,SECT. III.,"from the far Solyman mountains, and even is aware that he will escape"
7910,SECT. III.,from his present danger (ὀϊζὺς ἥ μιν ἱκάνει) by reaching the shore of
7911,SECT. III.,Scheria. This knowledge is shared by the minor goddess Leucothee: and
7912,SECT. III.,"doubtless on the same principle, namely, that it is marine knowledge."
7913,SECT. III.,So he can predict to Tyro that there will be more than one child born
7914,SECT. III.,"to her: here, too, he speaks of what is personal to himself. When we"
7915,SECT. III.,"take Neptune out of his province, we find none of these extraordinary"
7916,SECT. III.,"gifts, no sign of a peculiar subjugation of nature or of man to him. He"
7917,SECT. III.,"shares in the government of the world only as a vast force, which it"
7918,SECT. III.,will cost Jupiter trouble to subdue. Even within his own domain some
7919,SECT. III.,stubborn phenomena of nature impose limits on his power: for we are
7920,SECT. III.,"told he would not be able, even were he willing, to save Ulysses from"
7921,SECT. III.,Charybdis[396].

7924,SECT. III.,
7925,SECT. III.,"Thus it was that the sublime idea of one Governor of the universe,"
7926,SECT. III.,"omnipotent over all its parts, was shivered into many fragments, and"
7927,SECT. III.,"these high prerogatives, distributed and held in severalty, are the"
7928,SECT. III.,fragments of a conception too weighty and too comprehensive for the
7929,SECT. III.,unassisted human mind to carry in its entireness.
7930,SECT. III.,
7931,SECT. III.,~_His grandeur is material._~
7932,SECT. III.,
7933,SECT. III.,"Upon the whole, the intellectual spark in Neptune is feeble, and"
7934,SECT. III.,the conception is much materialized. Ideally he has the relation
7935,SECT. III.,"to Jupiter, which the statue of the Nile bears to one of Jupiter’s"
7936,SECT. III.,"statues. Within these limits, his position is grand. The ceaseless"
7937,SECT. III.,"motion, the unconquerable might, the wide extent, of the θάλασσα,"
7938,SECT. III.,"compose for him a noble monarchy. At first sight, when we read of the"
7939,SECT. III.,"lottery of the universe, we are startled at finding the earth left"
7940,SECT. III.,without an owner. It was not so in the Asiatic religions. But mark here
7941,SECT. III.,the influence of external circumstances. The nations of Asia inhabited
7942,SECT. III.,a vast continent; for them land was greater by far than sea. The
7943,SECT. III.,"Greeks knew of nothing but islands and peninsulas of limited extent,"
7944,SECT. III.,"whereas the Sea for them was infinite; since, except round the Ægean,"
7945,SECT. III.,they knew little or nothing of its farther shores. Thus the sceptre of
7946,SECT. III.,"Neptune reaches over the whole of the Outer Geography; while Earth, as"
7947,SECT. III.,"commonly understood, had long been left behind upon the course of the"
7948,SECT. III.,adventurous Ulysses.

7951,SECT. III.,

7953,SECT. III.,
7954,SECT. III.,"There is a marked contrast between the mere rank of Aides or Aidoneus,"
7955,SECT. III.,"and his want of substance and of activity, in the poems. He is one of"
7956,SECT. III.,"the three Kronid Brothers, of whom Neptune asserts--and we are nowhere"
7957,SECT. III.,told that it is an unwarrantable boast--that they are of equal dignity
7958,SECT. III.,and honour. He bears the lofty title of Ζεὺς καταχθόνιος: and he is the
7959,SECT. III.,husband of Persephone the Awful. It is plain that he belonged of right
7960,SECT. III.,"to the order of Olympian deities, because Dione states that he repaired"
7961,SECT. III.,"to the divine abode, to have the wounds healed there by Paieon, which"
7962,SECT. III.,he had received from Hercules: but it is very doubtful whether we
7963,SECT. III.,"ought to understand him to have attended even the great Chapter, or"
7964,SECT. III.,"Assembly, of the Twentieth Iliad. His ordinary residence is exclusively"
7965,SECT. III.,"in the nether world. At the same time there is, in his position, and"
7966,SECT. III.,"in that of Persephone, a remarkable independence. This the very title"
7967,SECT. III.,of subterranean Jupiter is enough to indicate. Neptune is never called
7968,SECT. III.,the Jupiter of the sea. And it is quite plain that the power of Jupiter
7969,SECT. III.,over the dead was limited. We cannot say it was null: for Castor and
7970,SECT. III.,"Pollux after death are still τιμὴν πρὸς Ζῆνος ἔχοντες, and they live"
7971,SECT. III.,accordingly on alternate days. But it was Minerva who interfered to
7972,SECT. III.,"carry Hercules safely through the Shades, and bring him back; and it"
7973,SECT. III.,appears that but for her Jupiter would not have been able to give
7974,SECT. III.,effect to his design[397].

7977,SECT. III.,
7978,SECT. III.,But the share of action ascribed to this divinity in any part of the
7979,SECT. III.,"poems is a very small one. In the Twentieth Iliad, the tramp of the"
7980,SECT. III.,"Immortals, when engaged in fight, and the quaking of the earth under"
7981,SECT. III.,"the might of Neptune, cause him to tremble. And his having received"
7982,SECT. III.,"wounds from Hercules, though he shared this indignity with Juno,"
7983,SECT. III.,detracts from his mythological greatness.
7984,SECT. III.,
7985,SECT. III.,Love of symmetry has sometimes led writers on the Greek mythology to
7986,SECT. III.,find matrimonial arrangements for Jupiter’s brothers similar to his
7987,SECT. III.,"own, by giving to Neptune Amphitrite, and to Aidoneus Persephone,"
7988,SECT. III.,for their respective wives. The former of these two unions has no
7989,SECT. III.,foundation in Homer; and the latter bears little analogy to that of
7990,SECT. III.,Jupiter and Juno. For Proserpine is the real Queen of the Shades below:
7991,SECT. III.,all the higher traditions and active duties of the place centre around
7992,SECT. III.,"her, while he appears there as a sort of King-Consort. There is no"
7993,SECT. III.,"sign whatever of his exercising any influence over her, far less of"
7994,SECT. III.,her acting in the capacity of his organ. And while she has a cult or
7995,SECT. III.,"worship on earth, he apparently has none."
7996,SECT. III.,
7997,SECT. III.,"Under these circumstances, we do not expect to find her exhibiting"
7998,SECT. III.,"any tokens of derivation from, or ideal dependance on him. They would"
7999,SECT. III.,appear to be respectively derived from traditions of independent origin.
8000,SECT. III.,
8001,SECT. III.,Homer has not attached marks to Aidoneus which would enable us to
8002,SECT. III.,trace him to any particular source beyond the limits of the Olympian
8003,SECT. III.,system. It would be natural to seek his prototype among the darkest
8004,SECT. III.,and earthiest of the elemental powers. But he appears before us in the
8005,SECT. III.,"poems rather as an independent and Hellenic creation, metaphysical in"
8006,SECT. III.,"kind, and representing little beyond (1), a place in the trine number"
8007,SECT. III.,"of the Kronid Brothers, which appears to be the Hellenic form of a"
8008,SECT. III.,"great primitive tradition of a Trinity in the Godhead; and (2), the"
8009,SECT. III.,"consciousness that there was a city and a government of the dead, and"
8010,SECT. III.,"that a ruler must be provided for them, while the idea of the Supreme"
8011,SECT. III.,Deity had not retained enough of force and comprehensiveness to seem
8012,SECT. III.,sufficient for the purpose.
8013,SECT. III.,
8014,SECT. III.,"As the representative of inexorable death, Aidoneus was the opposite of"
8015,SECT. III.,the bright and life-giving Apollo: and was naturally the most hateful
8016,SECT. III.,to mortals of all the Olympian deities[398]. But the place in which the
8017,SECT. III.,idea of punishment centres is the domain of Κρόνος rather than that of
8018,SECT. III.,Aides: and he is the ruler over a state of the dead which is generally
8019,SECT. III.,"neither bliss nor acute suffering, but which is deeply overspread with"
8020,SECT. III.,chillness and gloom.

8034,SECT. III.,"The goddess Demeter, the Ceres of the Latins, though afterwards of"
8035,SECT. III.,"considerable dignity and importance, is but a feeble luminary in the"
8036,SECT. III.,Homeric heavens. That there are in the Iliad[400] only two distinct
8037,SECT. III.,"notices of her personality, might of itself be compatible with a"
8038,SECT. III.,contrary supposition: for in the _Troica_ he introduces his divine
8039,SECT. III.,"personages on account of their relation to the subject, rather than"
8040,SECT. III.,"for their general importance; and corn, which feeds man, has little"
8041,SECT. III.,"affinity with war, which destroys him. But her weight is, if possible,"
8042,SECT. III.,"even smaller in the Odyssey, where she is noticed but once[401], and"
8043,SECT. III.,that incidentally.

8050,SECT. III.,"for Vulcan, and Ἄρης for the spear, or for the battle, tends to"
8051,SECT. III.,indicate imperfect personality; to show that the deity was indistinctly
8052,SECT. III.,realized; that the personal name was either recent or at least
8053,SECT. III.,"unfamiliar; and that it was used, not so much to designate a being, as"
8054,SECT. III.,to give life to an idea.
8055,SECT. III.,
8056,SECT. III.,Homer has not asserted any connection between Demeter and Persephone:
8057,SECT. III.,and the idea of it in later times may have arisen simply from the
8058,SECT. III.,observation that in the poems Demeter stands as a mother without a
8059,SECT. III.,"child, and Persephone as a daughter without a mother."
8060,SECT. III.,
8061,SECT. III.,"Possibly, however, the connection may have been suggested by the name;"
8062,SECT. III.,which seems manifestly to be equivalent to Γῆ μήτηρ or Mother-Earth.
8063,SECT. III.,And though the original reference was to the production of food by
8064,SECT. III.,"which man lives, the word might be susceptible of another sense,"
8065,SECT. III.,"connecting it with the nether world, which had a material relation to"
8066,SECT. III.,"Earth, and which, even in Homer, Tityus the son of Γαῖα, and in the"
8067,SECT. III.,"later tradition the earth-born race generally, were reputed to inhabit."
8068,SECT. III.,
8069,SECT. III.,"The name in its proper sense indicates first the idea, and then the"
8070,SECT. III.,"goddess of agriculture: and points to a Pelasgian, and perhaps farther"
8071,SECT. III.,"back an Egyptian, rather than an Hellenic or a Phœnician connection. In"
8072,SECT. III.,"Egypt, according to the reports collected by Diodorus[402], Isis was"
8073,SECT. III.,held nearly to correspond with her.
8074,SECT. III.,
8075,SECT. III.,[402] Diod. i. 13.
8076,SECT. III.,
8077,SECT. III.,With this supposition agree the only notices contained in the poems
8078,SECT. III.,that tend to attach the goddess Demeter to a particular locality. Her
8079,SECT. III.,"connection with Iasion was probably in Crete or Cyprus, or at any rate"
8080,SECT. III.,"(from the name) in some country occupied, and ruled too, by Pelasgians."
8081,SECT. III.,"Her τέμενος[403] or dedicated lands in Thessaly, the Pelasgic Argos,"
8082,SECT. III.,suggest a similar presumption. In Middle Greece and Peloponnesus we
8083,SECT. III.,never hear of her. The very solemn and ancient observance of her
8084,SECT. III.,"worship in Attica, which was so eminently a Pelasgian state in the time"
8085,SECT. III.,"of Homer, entirely accords with the indications of the Homeric text."
8086,SECT. III.,
8087,SECT. III.,[403] Il. ii. 696.
8088,SECT. III.,
8089,SECT. III.,"The slight notice she obtains from Homer, compared with the dignity to"
8090,SECT. III.,"which other tokens would tend to show that she was entitled, may have"
8091,SECT. III.,been owing to the incomplete amalgamation in his time of Hellenic and
8092,SECT. III.,Pelasgian institutions.
8093,SECT. III.,
8094,SECT. III.,"Upon this goddess, as upon so many others, sensual passion had laid"
8095,SECT. III.,"hold. This is decidedly confirmatory of her Pelasgian or eastern, as"
8096,SECT. III.,opposed to properly Hellic associations. We see Venus coming from
8097,SECT. III.,the east and worshipped in Pelasgian countries: of the three persons
8098,SECT. III.,"whom Aurora appropriates, Orion is pretty evidently the subject of a"
8099,SECT. III.,"naturalized eastern tradition, and Tithonus is Asiatic: Calypso and"
8100,SECT. III.,Circe belong to the east by Phœnicia: it is in Troas and Asia that no
8101,SECT. III.,"less than three Nymphs appear as the bearers of children, fighting"
8102,SECT. III.,"on the Trojan side, to human fathers[404]. Whereas among the more"
8103,SECT. III.,"Hellenic deities, we have Minerva and Proserpine wholly exempt; and"
8104,SECT. III.,"Juno using sensual passion it is true, but only for a political end."
8105,SECT. III.,"This assemblage of facts further confirms the supposition, that Ceres"
8106,SECT. III.,"ought to be set down as a Pelasgian deity. Orion and Ino, shining in"
8107,SECT. III.,"the heavens, seem to belong to the more astronomical form of eastern"
8108,SECT. III.,religion: Ceres to that which was probably transmitted through fertile
8109,SECT. III.,and well-cultivated Egypt.

8112,SECT. III.,
8113,SECT. III.,~_Her place in Olympus._~
8114,SECT. III.,
8115,SECT. III.,The title of Demeter to rank with the Olympian deities of Homer is not
8116,SECT. III.,"so absolutely clear, as that of many among them: but it may on the"
8117,SECT. III.,whole be sufficiently inferred from the arrangement of the passage in
8118,SECT. III.,"the Fourteenth Odyssey, where Jupiter recites a list of the various"
8119,SECT. III.,"partners to whom he owed his offspring. The three first are women,"
8120,SECT. III.,"who bore sons never deified, Pirithous, Perseus, and Minos: the two"
8121,SECT. III.,"next are women, of whom one gave birth to Dionysus a god, the other"
8122,SECT. III.,to the substantially deified Hercules. The sixth and seventh are
8123,SECT. III.,"Demeter, or Ceres, and Latona; the children of neither are mentioned."
8124,SECT. III.,"Besides that Demeter is called καλλιπλόκαμος ἄνασσα, the two seem to"
8125,SECT. III.,be coupled together as goddesses. The structure of the passage is not
8126,SECT. III.,"chronological, but depends upon dignity advancing regularly towards"
8127,SECT. III.,"a climax; so purposely indeed, that Dionysus, always an immortal,"
8128,SECT. III.,"is mentioned after Hercules, a mortal born, though Semele had been"
8129,SECT. III.,named before Alcmene. All this appears to require the adoption of the
8130,SECT. III.,"conclusion, that Demeter was reckoned as an Olympian goddess in the"
8131,SECT. III.,Homeric system.
8132,SECT. III.,
8133,SECT. III.,"There is, however, another and more comprehensive solution of the"
8134,SECT. III.,question which arises out of the faint notices of Δημήτηρ in Homer.
8135,SECT. III.,"We ought, perhaps, to consider her as the Pelasgian, and Juno as"
8136,SECT. III.,"the Hellenic, reproduction of those eastern traditions, which gave"
8137,SECT. III.,mythological impersonation to the female principle. They naturally
8138,SECT. III.,"centred upon the Earth as the recipient of productive influences, and"
8139,SECT. III.,"as the great nurse and feeder of man, the τραφερὴ, the πολύφορβος,"
8140,SECT. III.,"the πουλυβότειρα, the ζείδωρος. The Pelasgic Demeter may be a very"
8141,SECT. III.,"fair and close copy, in all probability, from these traditions as"
8142,SECT. III.,they existed in Egypt. But when the same materials were presented to
8143,SECT. III.,"the Hellenic mind, they could not satisfy its active and idealizing"
8144,SECT. III.,"fancy. For the Hellene, man was greater than nature: so that the"
8145,SECT. III.,great office of Jupiter as king of air was subordinated to his yet
8146,SECT. III.,more august function as the supreme superintendent and controller of
8147,SECT. III.,human affairs. As the political idea thus predominated in the chief of
8148,SECT. III.,"the Hellenic Immortals, it was requisite that a similar predominance"
8149,SECT. III.,of the intellectual and organizing element should be obtained in
8150,SECT. III.,"his divine Mate. Traditions, however, that had their root in earth,"
8151,SECT. III.,"were of necessity wholly intractable for such a purpose, although"
8152,SECT. III.,the lighter and more spirit-like fabric of air was less unsuited to
8153,SECT. III.,"it. Earth was heavy, inactive; and was the prime representative of"
8154,SECT. III.,matter as opposed to mind. Hence the personality of the tradition was
8155,SECT. III.,"severed by the Greeks from its material groundwork; and Earth, the"
8156,SECT. III.,"Nature-power, remained beneath, while the figure of Juno, relieved"
8157,SECT. III.,"from this incumbrance, and invested with majestic and vigorous"
8158,SECT. III.,"attributes, soared aloft and took the place of eldest sister and first"
8159,SECT. III.,wife of Jupiter. Hence doubtless it is that the Γαῖα of Homer is so
8160,SECT. III.,inanimate and weakling: because she was but the exhausted residue of
8161,SECT. III.,"a tradition, from which the higher life had escaped. But the Ἥρη and"
8162,SECT. III.,"the Γαῖα, according to this hypothesis, made up between them a full"
8163,SECT. III.,"representation of the traditions from the East, relating to the chief"
8164,SECT. III.,"female form of deity. This being so, no legitimate place was left in"
8165,SECT. III.,the mythology of Homer for Ceres; as she had nothing to represent but
8166,SECT. III.,"the same tradition in a form far less adapted to the Hellenic mind, a"
8167,SECT. III.,form indeed which it had probably repudiated. Hence while the Olympian
8168,SECT. III.,"system was young, and Juno not wholly severed from her Oriental origin,"
8169,SECT. III.,the Γῆ μήτηρ could not but remain a mere outlier. But as the poetry of
8170,SECT. III.,"the system was developed, and its philosophy submerged and forgotten,"
8171,SECT. III.,"this difficulty diminished, and the later mythology found an ample"
8172,SECT. III.,space for Ceres as a great elemental power.
8173,SECT. III.,
8174,SECT. III.,"I may, then, observe, in conclusion, that the whole of this hypothesis"
8175,SECT. III.,is eminently agreeable to the Homeric representation of Ceres in
8176,SECT. III.,"its four main branches, (1) as Pelasgian, (2) as subject to lustful"
8177,SECT. III.,"passion, (3) as a secondary wife of Jupiter, and (4) as immediately"
8178,SECT. III.,associated with productive Earth.

8180,SECT. III.,_Persephone._
8181,SECT. III.,
8182,SECT. III.,~_The Persephone of Homer._~
8183,SECT. III.,
8184,SECT. III.,"Although the Persephone of Homer is rarely brought before us, and"
8185,SECT. III.,"our information respecting her is therefore slight, there seems to"
8186,SECT. III.,be sufficient ground for asserting that she is not the mere female
8187,SECT. III.,reflection of Hades or Aidoneus.
8188,SECT. III.,
8189,SECT. III.,It is only for those deities from whom other deities are drawn by
8190,SECT. III.,"descent, that we find in Homer a regular conjugal connection provided."
8191,SECT. III.,"Thus Neptune, as we have seen, cannot be said to have a wife in Homer."
8192,SECT. III.,Amphitrite appears in the poems with a faint and indeed altogether
8193,SECT. III.,"doubtful personality, though she afterwards grew into his spouse."
8194,SECT. III.,Now Neptune was a deity much more in view than Aides: and it is not
8195,SECT. III.,likely that we should have found Persephone more fully developed than
8196,SECT. III.,"Amphitrite, had she not represented some older and more independent"
8197,SECT. III.,tradition.
8198,SECT. III.,
8199,SECT. III.,"Again, in cases where the female deity is the mere reflection of"
8200,SECT. III.,"the male, we do not find her invested with a share in his dominion,"
8201,SECT. III.,"although, as in the case of Juno, she may occasionally and"
8202,SECT. III.,"derivatively exercise some of the prerogatives, which in him have a"
8203,SECT. III.,higher and more unquestionable activity. Thus Tartarus is the region
8204,SECT. III.,"of Κρόνος, not of Ῥέα; air is the realm of Jupiter, not of Jupiter and"
8205,SECT. III.,Juno. But Persephone appears by the side of Hades as a substantive
8206,SECT. III.,"person; she is invoked with him by Althea to slay Meleager, in the"
8207,SECT. III.,Legend of the Ninth Iliad[405]: and the region in which she dwells is
8208,SECT. III.,"not less hers than his[406],"

8215,SECT. III.,
8216,SECT. III.,Indeed her personality is the better developed of the two: for
8217,SECT. III.,"no personal act is ascribed in the poems to Aides, except the"
8218,SECT. III.,"indeterminate one of trembling, at the battle of the gods, lest the"
8219,SECT. III.,crust of earth should be broken through: and the name given him in the
8220,SECT. III.,"Iliad of Ζεὺς καταχθόνιος, subterranean Jupiter, may possibly suggest"
8221,SECT. III.,that he was sometimes viewed as hardly more than a form or function of
8222,SECT. III.,"the highest god: whereas, in the under-world of the Eleventh Odyssey,"
8223,SECT. III.,all the active functions of sovereignty are placed in her hands. It
8224,SECT. III.,is she who gathers the women-shades for Ulysses: and it is she who
8225,SECT. III.,disperses them when they have been passed in review. It is by her that
8226,SECT. III.,Ulysses apprehends the head of Gorgo may be sent forth to drive him
8227,SECT. III.,"off, should he linger too long; it is by her that he apprehends he may"
8228,SECT. III.,"have been deluded with an εἴδωλον or shade, instead of a substance;"
8229,SECT. III.,"most of all, it is she who endows Tiresias, alone among the dead, with"
8230,SECT. III.,"the character of the Seer[407]. In fine, the whole of the active duties"
8231,SECT. III.,of the nether kingdom appear to be in her hands.

8234,SECT. III.,
8235,SECT. III.,That she was generally worshipped by the Hellenic tribes we must infer
8236,SECT. III.,"from the cases mentioned in the Ninth Iliad, the one in Ætolia, the"

8238,SECT. III.,thoroughly national region of the Shades.

8242,SECT. III.,~_Her marked and substantive character._~
8243,SECT. III.,
8244,SECT. III.,"She has her own strongly marked set of epithets. Of these, one is ἁγνὴ,"
8245,SECT. III.,the severely pure; for with Homer ἁγνὸς is exclusively applicable to
8246,SECT. III.,"divine womanhood, and is given only to Diana and Persephone: then she"
8247,SECT. III.,"is ἀγαυὴ, the dread: and lastly, she is ἐπαινὴ, an epithet appropriated"
8248,SECT. III.,"to her exclusively, which appears to be Homer’s favourite method for"
8249,SECT. III.,sharply marking out individuality of character. Buttmann has also well
8250,SECT. III.,"observed, that she has this epithet only when mentioned along with"
8251,SECT. III.,"Hades, that is, when shown very strictly in her official character; and"
8252,SECT. III.,that ἀγαυὴ is used when she appears alone. Upon this he observes; ‘this
8253,SECT. III.,way of joining the name of Proserpine with that of Pluto was an old
8254,SECT. III.,"epic formula, handed down even to Homer and our oldest Greek poets from"
8255,SECT. III.,"still earlier times, and which they used unchanged[409].’ He would read"
8256,SECT. III.,"ἐπ’ αἰνὴ, instead of ἐπαινὴ, but this neither affects the sense (awful,"
8257,SECT. III.,terrible) nor the force of the exclusive appropriation.

8260,SECT. III.,
8261,SECT. III.,There is another sign confirmatory of the belief that the origin of
8262,SECT. III.,"this mythical person must be sought, not in the necessity of finding a"
8263,SECT. III.,"queen for Aidoneus, but in an anterior and distinct tradition. Namely,"
8264,SECT. III.,"this; that, though she is a daughter of Jupiter[410], she is not"
8265,SECT. III.,provided with a mother. Thus she seems as if she were older than the
8266,SECT. III.,"Olympian œconomy. Venus, Mars, Vulcan, Mercury, are all equipped with a"
8267,SECT. III.,"full parentage. The later tradition, which made Persephone the daughter"
8268,SECT. III.,"of Ceres, has no other support from Homer than this, that we are left"
8269,SECT. III.,"to suppose that Ceres had some offspring by Jupiter, while none is"
8270,SECT. III.,named[411].

8278,SECT. III.,"In the far East[412], beyond the couch of the morning Sun, some"
8279,SECT. III.,"distance up the stream of the great river Ocean, but to the south of"
8280,SECT. III.,"the point where it is entered, and at a spot where the shore narrows"
8281,SECT. III.,"very much--immediately, in short, before the point of descent--are the"
8282,SECT. III.,groves of Persephone. According to the general rules of interpretation
8283,SECT. III.,"applicable to Homer, this appears to convey to us that the seat of her"
8284,SECT. III.,"worship was in the far Southern East, and that her office, as there"
8285,SECT. III.,"understood, was that of the goddess or queen of Death. And if she is"
8286,SECT. III.,"indeed the reflection, in the mirror of the lower world, of any other"
8287,SECT. III.,"known deity, then, both from this great office, and from the peculiar"
8288,SECT. III.,"epithet ἁγνὴ, it is most likely to be of Diana, with whom, in the later"
8289,SECT. III.,"mythology, she was identified; and, again, through Diana, of Apollo,"
8290,SECT. III.,"from whom the light of Diana herself was derived. Or, in other words,"

8293,SECT. III.,"gift of second sight, which she allows to Tiresias, and which therefore"

8303,SECT. III.,"slaughter; from two roots, one that represented in ἔπερσα, from the"
8304,SECT. III.,"verb πέρθω, and the other φόνη; or else, that of the destruction or"
8305,SECT. III.,"slaughter of Persians. In the former view, the evidence leaves us"
8306,SECT. III.,"where we were, or brings us a point nearer to Diana, whose function"
8307,SECT. III.,"was not that of all death whatever, but of such death as might be"
8308,SECT. III.,"called slaughter, because not due to disease, but brought about at the"
8309,SECT. III.,"moment by a sudden process, though often the mildest of all ways of"
8310,SECT. III.,dying[414]. But the other etymology may be worth some further attention.

8314,SECT. III.,~_Her connection with the East_.~
8315,SECT. III.,
8316,SECT. III.,"Besides that cluster of traditions, relating to remote places, which"
8317,SECT. III.,"the Greeks derived from the Phœnician navigators, and which cannot but"
8318,SECT. III.,"have included some eastward wanderings in the Black Sea, as well as"
8319,SECT. III.,"westward experience in the Mediterranean, they must in all likelihood"
8320,SECT. III.,"have had oriental traditions properly their own, brought by their"
8321,SECT. III.,Hellic forefathers with them from their cradle. We have already seen
8322,SECT. III.,that that cradle was probably Persia; and we have found traces of the
8323,SECT. III.,"connection in the name of the great pre-Achæan hero, Perseus, and in"
8324,SECT. III.,"the continuing use of that name in the high Achæan family of Nestor,"
8325,SECT. III.,"as well as at much later historic dates. Another link, connecting the"
8326,SECT. III.,"Homeric traditions with this name, and both with the East, is found in"
8327,SECT. III.,"the name of Perse, who was the mother of Circe, an Eastern goddess; and"
8328,SECT. III.,"who was the daughter of Ocean, and the wife of the Sun[415]."
8329,SECT. III.,
8330,SECT. III.,[415] Od. x. 135-9.
8331,SECT. III.,
8332,SECT. III.,We must take these circumstances into view along with the force of
8333,SECT. III.,"the name Persephone, and with the evidence we have already had of the"
8334,SECT. III.,antiquity of the traditions relating to her. To this we have to add
8335,SECT. III.,the absence of any Homeric evidence connecting her with any other
8336,SECT. III.,"local source. There is no sign of any institution, that belonged to"
8337,SECT. III.,"her worship, except in those groves planted in the far East; and no"
8338,SECT. III.,"sign of any other particular locality marked as her peculiar abode,"
8339,SECT. III.,which we have found to be a mark of such invented deities generally as
8340,SECT. III.,had a well developed personality. There is no note of her whatever in
8341,SECT. III.,"Troas; and nothing to connect her with Egypt, or with the Pelasgians in"
8342,SECT. III.,"any quarter. It is not likely that she came in with the Phœnicians, as"
8343,SECT. III.,"she would then have had signs of a recent origin, and would not have"
8344,SECT. III.,attained to so august and mysterious a position as she actually holds.
8345,SECT. III.,The two distinct notices of her worship are both in the Homeric Hellas;
8346,SECT. III.,"not in Southern Greece, nor in the islands."
8347,SECT. III.,
8348,SECT. III.,"It seems, therefore, on every ground reasonable to suppose, that the"
8349,SECT. III.,tradition of Proserpine was an original Hellic tradition brought into
8350,SECT. III.,"the country from the East, probably by the Hellic tribes, and from"
8351,SECT. III.,"among their Persian forefathers; and that the name of the deity, as we"
8352,SECT. III.,"find it in Homer, affords a new indication of the extraction of the"
8353,SECT. III.,race.
8354,SECT. III.,
8355,SECT. III.,"Accordingly, the unusually substantive aspect of her position in"
8356,SECT. III.,"the nether world, which makes her relation to Aidoneus so different"
8357,SECT. III.,"from that of the other mythological wives, or feminines, to their"
8358,SECT. III.,"respective husbands, is such, that it seems most reasonable, instead of"
8359,SECT. III.,"deriving her from him, as Juno was derived from Jupiter, or Tethys from"
8360,SECT. III.,"Ocean, to consider them as representing the union of two independent"
8361,SECT. III.,"impersonations, associated together primarily by their common subject"
8362,SECT. III.,matter. For there does not seem to be any thing improbable in the
8363,SECT. III.,"hypothesis, that Persephone may, in the belief of some country and age,"
8364,SECT. III.,have served alone for the ruler of the region of the dead. Just as so
8365,SECT. III.,"many subordinate ministers of Doom, the Fates, the Erinues, and the"
8366,SECT. III.,"Harpies, assumed the female form in the process of impersonation, so"
8367,SECT. III.,it may have been with their sovereign. And if we are to look farther
8368,SECT. III.,"for the metaphysical groundwork of such a tradition, we may perhaps"
8369,SECT. III.,find it as follows. There is a relation of analogy between each
8370,SECT. III.,"function and its converse: and as in the pure mythology, all that gave"
8371,SECT. III.,"life was feminine, so conversely, all that represented the destroying"
8372,SECT. III.,agency might assume a similar form.
8373,SECT. III.,
8374,SECT. III.,~_Her relation to Olympus_.~
8375,SECT. III.,
8376,SECT. III.,"In her case, as in that of one or two others, it is difficult to"
8377,SECT. III.,"discover whether Homer meant a particular deity to be included, or not,"
8378,SECT. III.,among the Olympian gods of the ordinary or smaller assembly. There is
8379,SECT. III.,"no indication in the poems, which directly connects Persephone with"
8380,SECT. III.,Olympus; and that celestial palace may seem to belong to the government
8381,SECT. III.,"of the living world, and to be almost incapable of relations with that"
8382,SECT. III.,of the departed. Nor is she connected specially with the Olympian
8383,SECT. III.,"system, like Aidoneus, by the position which birth confers. The ἄλσος,"
8384,SECT. III.,"and the worship paid her there, can hardly belong to the departed"
8385,SECT. III.,"spirits on their way to their abode, and more probably indicate an"
8386,SECT. III.,ancient tradition deriving her worship from the far East. On the other
8387,SECT. III.,"hand, her dignity and majesty in the poems are unquestionable, and"
8388,SECT. III.,"indeed superior to those of any Olympian deity, after some five or six."
8389,SECT. III.,I do not find materials for a confident judgment on the Homeric view
8390,SECT. III.,"of her place in his theo-mythology, with reference to this particular"
8391,SECT. III.,point of connection with Olympus.
8392,SECT. III.,
8393,SECT. III.,"Founding conjecture upon the facts before us, I venture, however, on"
8394,SECT. III.,a further extension of these hypotheses with respect to Persephone.
8395,SECT. III.,We perceive in Persephone and Diana that kind of likeness which may
8396,SECT. III.,"be due to their common origin; if, as we suppose, both were images of"
8397,SECT. III.,Apollo. But it is not likely that two such images should have been
8398,SECT. III.,"formed by the same race for itself. Can we then, probably refer Diana"
8399,SECT. III.,and Persephone to different sources ethnically?
8400,SECT. III.,
8401,SECT. III.,"It is plain that Diana was worshipped in Troy and Greece. Persephone,"
8402,SECT. III.,"so far as we know, in Greece only. This would agree with the"
8403,SECT. III.,"supposition that Diana was originally Pelasgian, Persephone only Hellic."
8404,SECT. III.,
8405,SECT. III.,"Again, Diana was an earthly, Persephone a subterraneous reflection of"
8406,SECT. III.,Apollo. Now the Hellic tribes were lively believers in a future state:
8407,SECT. III.,"as we see from the communion of Achilles with the soul of Patroclus,"
8408,SECT. III.,and from many places in the Odyssey. But we have nowhere in Homer the
8409,SECT. III.,"slightest allusion among the Trojans to the belief in a future state,"
8410,SECT. III.,beyond the mere formula of entering the region of Aïdes. Neither the
8411,SECT. III.,"succinct account of the funeral rites of Hector, nor any one of the"
8412,SECT. III.,"three addresses over his remains, contain the slightest allusion to his"
8413,SECT. III.,"separate existence as a spirit. There is, indeed, mention of wine used"
8414,SECT. III.,"to extinguish the flame of the funeral pile, but none of invocation"
8415,SECT. III.,"along with it, as there is in the case of Patroclus[416]. And as we"
8416,SECT. III.,have no less than an hundred lines spoken over or otherwise bestowed
8417,SECT. III.,"upon the dead Hector, the omission is singular. It becomes still more"
8418,SECT. III.,"significant, when we recollect that the Greeks, and their goddess"
8419,SECT. III.,"Juno, invoke the deities of the under-world, and the powers connected"
8420,SECT. III.,"with a future state, in their solemn oaths and imprecations[417]; but"
8421,SECT. III.,"when Hector swears to Dolon, (our only example of a Trojan oath,) he"
8422,SECT. III.,adjures Jupiter alone[418]. Now it may be that the religion of Troy
8423,SECT. III.,"did not include so distinct a reference to a future state, as that of"
8424,SECT. III.,"Greece, and that the Trojans knew nothing of Persephone, or of any"
8425,SECT. III.,deity holding her place. This hypothesis would at once accord with
8426,SECT. III.,"the features of the Homeric portrait, and with the striking absence"
8427,SECT. III.,"among the Trojans of all pointed reference to a future life, or to"
8428,SECT. III.,the disembodied spirit. Nor need we consider it to be at all shaken
8429,SECT. III.,"by slight and formal allusions, or by the words in which Homer on his"
8430,SECT. III.,own part dismisses to Hades the spirit of the slain Hector[419]. The
8431,SECT. III.,"hypothesis which the circumstances appear to suggest is, not that"
8432,SECT. III.,"the Trojans disbelieved a future existence, but that they neither"
8433,SECT. III.,"felt keenly respecting it, nor gave a mythological development to the"
8434,SECT. III.,doctrine.

8447,SECT. III.,
8448,SECT. III.,"Even in Homer, Mars is externally the most imposing figure among the"
8449,SECT. III.,masculine deities of pure invention. The greatest of war-bards could
8450,SECT. III.,not but find him a fine subject for poetical amplification. But in the
8451,SECT. III.,Roman period he had far outgrown the limits of his Homeric position.
8452,SECT. III.,"With the lapse of time, the forces and passions, which gave to this"
8453,SECT. III.,"impersonation its hold upon human nature, were sure to prevail in a"
8454,SECT. III.,considerable degree over the finer elements from which Apollo was
8455,SECT. III.,moulded. It requires an effort of mind to liberate ourselves from the
8456,SECT. III.,"associations of the later mythology, and contract our vision for the"
8457,SECT. III.,purpose of estimating the Mars of Homer as he really is.
8458,SECT. III.,
8459,SECT. III.,"Notwithstanding his stature, beauty, hand and voice, which constitute,"
8460,SECT. III.,"taken together, a proud appearance, it seems as if Mars had stood lower"
8461,SECT. III.,in the mind of Homer than any Olympian deity who takes part in the
8462,SECT. III.,"Trojan war, except Venus only."
8463,SECT. III.,
8464,SECT. III.,"The Odyssey never once brings Mars before us, even by way of allusion,"
8465,SECT. III.,except in the licentious lay of Demodocus; and the spirit of that
8466,SECT. III.,"lay certainly seems to aim at making him ridiculous, especially in"
8467,SECT. III.,"the manner of his release and withdrawal. In the Iliad his part is,"
8468,SECT. III.,"of course, more considerable; but on no occasion whatever does Homer"
8469,SECT. III.,"apparently seek to set him off, or give him a commanding attitude in"
8470,SECT. III.,comparison with other deities.
8471,SECT. III.,
8472,SECT. III.,We have nowhere any account of any act of reverence or worship done to
8473,SECT. III.,"him, either in or out of Greece. For instance, he is never, even in the"
8474,SECT. III.,"contingencies of war, the object of prayer. He never shows command over"
8475,SECT. III.,"the powers of nature, or the mind of man; which he nowhere attempts"
8476,SECT. III.,"to influence by suggestion. It is said, indeed, that he entered into"
8477,SECT. III.,"Hector, as that warrior was putting on the armour of Achilles;"

8483,SECT. III.,
8484,SECT. III.,But no words could more conclusively fix his place in the Homeric
8485,SECT. III.,system as the mere impersonation of a Passion. For with Homer no
8486,SECT. III.,"greater deity, indeed, no other of the Olympian gods, is ever said to"
8487,SECT. III.,enter into the mind of a mortal man. In the Fifth Book he stirs up
8488,SECT. III.,"the warlike passion of Menelaus; having, like Venus, a limited hold"
8489,SECT. III.,upon a particular propensity. His climax of honour in this department
8490,SECT. III.,is his giving θάρσος to the Pseudo-Ulysses; but this he does only in
8491,SECT. III.,conjunction with Minerva[421].

8496,SECT. III.,
8497,SECT. III.,His possession of the attributes of deity appears to have been most
8498,SECT. III.,"limited. The use of the word Ἄρης not only for the passion of war, but"
8499,SECT. III.,"even for its weapons, shows us that the impersonation was in this case"
8500,SECT. III.,"as yet very partially disengaged from the metaphysical ideas, or the"
8501,SECT. III.,"material objects, in which it took its rise."
8502,SECT. III.,
8503,SECT. III.,His function as god of war was confined to the merely material side
8504,SECT. III.,"of war, and had nothing to do with that aspect, in which war enlists"
8505,SECT. III.,"and exhausts all the higher faculties of the human mind; so much so,"
8506,SECT. III.,"indeed, that to be a great general is almost necessary in order to"
8507,SECT. III.,enter the first rank of greatness at all. Even of war in the lower
8508,SECT. III.,"sense he had not, as a god, exclusive possession, but he administered"
8509,SECT. III.,"his office in partnership with a superior, Minerva. Besides being every"
8510,SECT. III.,"thing else that she was, she presided, along with him, over war. On"
8511,SECT. III.,"the shield of Achilles, he and Minerva lead the opposing hosts[422]."
8512,SECT. III.,"Over the body of Patroclus the struggle was one of which, says the"
8513,SECT. III.,"Poet, neither Mars nor Minerva could think lightly[423]. Achilles, when"
8514,SECT. III.,"pursuing the Trojans, calls for assistance; for, says he, neither Mars"
8515,SECT. III.,nor Minerva could undertake to dispose of such a multitude[424]. Mars

8642,SECT. III.,"Mars, however, incurs the particular wrath of Juno by abandoning the"
8643,SECT. III.,"party of the Greeks, and siding with the Trojans. But in the Fifteenth"
8644,SECT. III.,"Book, where Juno acquaints him of the death of his son, who had fought"
8645,SECT. III.,"in the Greek ranks, she evidently does it in the expectation that grief"
8646,SECT. III.,and resentment will once more make him a foe to the Trojans. And her
8647,SECT. III.,"calculation is well founded: for he is setting out with that intention,"
8648,SECT. III.,"when Minerva follows, and roughly brings him back."
8649,SECT. III.,
8650,SECT. III.,"He only appears once in a pre-Troic legend. This appearance, too, is"
8651,SECT. III.,"beyond the borders of Greece. In Lycia he, or, it may be, simply"
8652,SECT. III.,"warlike passion which he represents, slays Isander, the son of"
8653,SECT. III.,"Bellerophon and uncle of Glaucus, in battle with the Solymi. Still he"
8654,SECT. III.,"is the father by Astyoche, of Ascalaphus and Ialmenus, somewhere in the"
8655,SECT. III.,"neighbourhood of the Minyeian Orchomenus, or else farther towards the"
8656,SECT. III.,north of Greece.
8657,SECT. III.,
8658,SECT. III.,"The Homeric indications, on the whole, as well as the general"
8659,SECT. III.,"conceptions of the character, represent Mars as neither a deity"
8660,SECT. III.,"indigenous to the country, nor one belonging to the Hellenic"
8661,SECT. III.,traditions: while the Poet perhaps intends us to understand that he
8662,SECT. III.,"had points of contact or affinity with Greece, which are represented"
8663,SECT. III.,in his wavering attitude between the two parties to the war. It is
8664,SECT. III.,probable that the Poet himself may have been a principal agent in the
8665,SECT. III.,introduction of Mars to Hellenic worship. The machinery of the Iliad
8666,SECT. III.,"required him to find an array of gods, who should be champions on each"
8667,SECT. III.,side respectively. It also required that these gods should be united
8668,SECT. III.,"round a centre, which he provided for them in Olympus and in its Court,"
8669,SECT. III.,under the presidency of Jupiter. Both Mars and Venus may thus have made
8670,SECT. III.,"good a title, which before was doubtful and imperfect, through the"
8671,SECT. III.,"place to which they were promoted in the Iliad, combined with the place"
8672,SECT. III.,which the Iliad itself won for itself in the national understanding and
8673,SECT. III.,affections.

8678,SECT. III.,
8679,SECT. III.,The Homeric signs respecting Mercury are sufficient to fix his
8680,SECT. III.,"character and origin. The small part, which this deity plays in the"
8681,SECT. III.,"poems, is indeed in remarkable contrast with the extended popularity to"
8682,SECT. III.,which at a later period he attained: but his character in Homer is one
8683,SECT. III.,which accounts in a natural manner for the subsequent increase in his
8684,SECT. III.,importance.
8685,SECT. III.,
8686,SECT. III.,"He is the son of Maias, Od. xiv. 435; and of Jupiter, Od. viii. 335."

8697,SECT. III.,
8698,SECT. III.,The extraction of Mercury stands somewhat obscurely in Homer: his
8699,SECT. III.,"mother Maias is but once mentioned, and then without any clue. But,"
8700,SECT. III.,"in the ancient hymn to Mercury, she is declared to be the daughter of"
8701,SECT. III.,"Atlas: and if this be so, we shall be justified in considering him as"
8702,SECT. III.,the child of a Phœnician tradition[440]. This is also clear on Homeric
8703,SECT. III.,"grounds. Although Homer does not expressly connect him with Atlas, he"
8704,SECT. III.,"makes Calypso, the daughter of that personage, address him as αἰδοῖός"
8705,SECT. III.,τε φίλος τε. These expressions are usually applied by him where there
8706,SECT. III.,"is some special relation of consanguinity, affinity, or guestship:"
8707,SECT. III.,as between Jupiter and his adopted child[441] and particular friend
8708,SECT. III.,Thetis. It is therefore probable that Homer took Mercury’s mother Maias
8709,SECT. III.,"to be, as the after-tradition made her, the sister of Calypso, and the"
8710,SECT. III.,daughter of Atlas. All the other Homeric signs of him are in complete
8711,SECT. III.,harmony with this hypothesis of a Phœnician origin for Mercury.

8716,SECT. III.,
8717,SECT. III.,We thus understand how he becomes the general agent for the gods:
8718,SECT. III.,because the Phœnicians supplied the first and principal means of
8719,SECT. III.,communication between the several nations in the heroic age: they were
8720,SECT. III.,the men-of-business for the world[442].

8723,SECT. III.,
8724,SECT. III.,"It thus becomes plain, again, how he can with propriety be called the"
8725,SECT. III.,"giver of comforts or blessings; because the basis of commerce is this,"
8726,SECT. III.,that each person engaged in it parts with something which he does not
8727,SECT. III.,"want, and receives what he does want in return."
8728,SECT. III.,
8729,SECT. III.,"The apparent anomaly, which makes the god of increase also the god of"
8730,SECT. III.,"thievery, is thus explained: because, from its nature, commerce is ever"
8731,SECT. III.,"apt to degenerate partially into fraud; and because, in days of the"
8732,SECT. III.,"strong hand, force as well as intelligence would often make it easy for"
8733,SECT. III.,"the maritime merchants to change their vocation, for the occasion, into"
8734,SECT. III.,that of plunder[443].

8741,SECT. III.,"ἔργα, which may mean both the deeds and the industrial productions of"
8742,SECT. III.,"men, their χάρις and κῦδος, their grace and credit or popularity[444]."

8745,SECT. III.,
8746,SECT. III.,~_Mercury the god of increase._~
8747,SECT. III.,
8748,SECT. III.,This idea of increase forms the common or central element of the
8749,SECT. III.,various attributes assigned to Mercury. It takes two principal
8750,SECT. III.,"forms, one that of increase in material goods, the other that of the"
8751,SECT. III.,"propagation of the race. This latter, which was elsewhere grossly"
8752,SECT. III.,"exhibited, is veiled by Homer with his almost unfailing sense of"
8753,SECT. III.,"delicacy, and may not, indeed, have been fully developed in his time."
8754,SECT. III.,"It is perhaps however traceable in two passages of the poems: first,"
8755,SECT. III.,"that of the Sixteenth Iliad, where we are told that he corrupted the"
8756,SECT. III.,"virgin Polymele[445], though she belonged to the train of Diana. The"
8757,SECT. III.,"other is in the episode of Venus and Mars, where Apollo selects him as"
8758,SECT. III.,"the deity to whom to put the question, whether he would like to take"
8759,SECT. III.,"the place of the adulterer, and he replies in the affirmative[446]."
8760,SECT. III.,Each of these incidents seems to appertain to something distinctive in
8761,SECT. III.,his character.

8766,SECT. III.,
8767,SECT. III.,"That character, again, imports the extended intercourse with mankind,"
8768,SECT. III.,"and the knowledge of the world, which causes him to be chosen, in the"
8769,SECT. III.,"Twenty-Fourth Iliad, for the difficult office of conducting Priam to"
8770,SECT. III.,"the abode of Ulysses. Moreover, the great balance of material benefit"
8771,SECT. III.,"which commerce brings gives him, its patron, as a general rule, a"
8772,SECT. III.,genial and philanthropic aspect. In Homer we have nowhere any sign of
8773,SECT. III.,"his vengeance, anger, or severity. He neither punishes, hates, nor is"
8774,SECT. III.,"incensed with any one. A passionless and prudent deity, he not only"
8775,SECT. III.,"declines actual fighting with Latona, as she is a wife of Jupiter, but"
8776,SECT. III.,spontaneously gives her leave to boast among the gods that she has
8777,SECT. III.,engaged and worsted him.
8778,SECT. III.,
8779,SECT. III.,~_Mercury Hellenic and Phœnician._~
8780,SECT. III.,
8781,SECT. III.,The Phœnician origin of Mercury will also account for his position in
8782,SECT. III.,"the poems, in relation to the Trojans and Greeks respectively. Not"
8783,SECT. III.,simply is he one of the five Hellenizing deities: for his talents would
8784,SECT. III.,naturally with Homer tend to place him on that side. But he appears
8785,SECT. III.,almost wholly unknown to the Trojans. The abundance of the flocks of
8786,SECT. III.,Phorbas is indeed referred to his love (Il. xiv. 490): and he reveals
8787,SECT. III.,"himself to Priam by his name (Il. xxiv. 460): but it is remarkable, and"
8788,SECT. III.,"contrary to the general rule of the poems, that Priam, notwithstanding"
8789,SECT. III.,"his great obligations, takes no notice whatever of his deity, either"
8790,SECT. III.,"upon his first revelation and departure, or when a second time he"
8791,SECT. III.,"appears, and afterwards quits him anew (682-94)."
8792,SECT. III.,
8793,SECT. III.,"On the other hand, we have abundant signs of his familiarity with the"
8794,SECT. III.,Greeks. He conveys the sceptre from Jupiter to Pelops: he carries the
8795,SECT. III.,warning of the gods to Ægisthus: sacrifice is offered to him in Ithaca:
8796,SECT. III.,"and he is liberally treated with sacrifices by Autolycus in Parnesus,"
8797,SECT. III.,where he repays his worshipper by bestowing on him the arts of perjury
8798,SECT. III.,and purloining[447].

8800,SECT. III.,"[447] Od. xiv. 435, and xix. 394-8."
8801,SECT. III.,
8802,SECT. III.,"Now it is plain, from many places in the poems, that the Greeks had"
8803,SECT. III.,"much intercourse with the Phœnicians. On the other hand, the Trojans,"
8804,SECT. III.,"wealthy by internal products and home trade, seem to have known little"
8805,SECT. III.,"or nothing of maritime commerce. Their intercourse with Thrace, the"
8806,SECT. III.,"fertile Thrace that furnished a contingent of allies, required no"
8807,SECT. III.,more than that they should have the means of crossing the Straits of
8808,SECT. III.,Gallipoli. We nowhere hear that they had a port or harbour. A Phœnician
8809,SECT. III.,"deity would therefore, of course, be on the Achæan side during the war."
8810,SECT. III.,
8811,SECT. III.,"Independently of such an origin, he might, in his usual capacity of"
8812,SECT. III.,"agent, have been with perfect propriety sent to Calypso: but his"
8813,SECT. III.,"mythical relationship to her as a nephew, and her evident connection"
8814,SECT. III.,"with Phœnician traditions, give a peculiar propriety to his employment"
8815,SECT. III.,on this errand.
8816,SECT. III.,
8817,SECT. III.,"Another passage of the Odyssey seems, however, to place this"
8818,SECT. III.,"relationship beyond doubt. Ulysses, in the Twelfth Book, recounts"
8819,SECT. III.,to Alcinous the transaction that occurred in the Olympian Assembly
8820,SECT. III.,"after his crew had slain the oxen of the Sun. On that occasion, the"
8821,SECT. III.,"offended deity declared that, unless he got compensation, he would"
8822,SECT. III.,go down and shine in the realm of Aides; upon which Jupiter at once
8823,SECT. III.,"promised to destroy the ship of Ulysses. ‘This,’ adds Ulysses, ‘I"
8824,SECT. III.,"heard from Calypso, and she told me that she had herself heard it from"
8825,SECT. III.,Mercury[448].’
8826,SECT. III.,
8827,SECT. III.,"[448] Od. xii. 389, 90."
8828,SECT. III.,
8829,SECT. III.,"Now this was no affair of Calypso’s; none, that is, on which the gods"
8830,SECT. III.,could make a communication to her in regard to Ulysses: but it was
8831,SECT. III.,"one in which, from her passion for the hero, she would take a natural"
8832,SECT. III.,"interest, and on which she might well obtain information from a deity"
8833,SECT. III.,who was her relative. Nor does it appear on what other ground Mercury
8834,SECT. III.,"should be named, as the person who brought her this extra-official"
8835,SECT. III.,report.
8836,SECT. III.,
8837,SECT. III.,"Again, it is probably on account of his Phœnician connection, that"
8838,SECT. III.,"the intervention of Mercury is employed in the Tenth Odyssey[449], to"
8839,SECT. III.,"supply Ulysses with the instructions that were necessary, in order to"
8840,SECT. III.,enable him to cope with Circe.
8841,SECT. III.,
8842,SECT. III.,[449] Od. x. 275-307.
8843,SECT. III.,
8844,SECT. III.,"For we are here in the midst of a cluster of traditions, which we have"
8845,SECT. III.,"every reason to presume to be wholly Phœnician[450]. It is the cluster,"
8846,SECT. III.,which occupies the outer circle of the geography of the Odyssey: and
8847,SECT. III.,"it is severed from the Grecian world and experience, not only by a"
8848,SECT. III.,"geographical line, but by an entire change in mythological relations."
8849,SECT. III.,From the time when Ulysses enters that circle in the beginning of the
8850,SECT. III.,"Ninth Book, until his appearance near Scheria, on the outskirt of the"
8851,SECT. III.,"known familiar sphere, his ancient friend Minerva nowhere attends him:"
8852,SECT. III.,"and there are four whole books without even a mention of the goddess,"
8853,SECT. III.,"who, except for this interval, stands prominently forth in almost"
8854,SECT. III.,"every page of the Odyssey. The divine aid is given to him, during this"
8855,SECT. III.,"period, through Circe and Calypso; while Mercury is appointed to"
8856,SECT. III.,"command the latter, and to enable Ulysses to overcome the former. Both"
8857,SECT. III.,"the company and the traditions, amidst which Mercury is found, thus"
8858,SECT. III.,invite us to presume that he is a deity of Phœnician importation into
8859,SECT. III.,Greece.
8860,SECT. III.,
8861,SECT. III.,"[450] See ‘Achæis, or Ethnology,’ sect. iv."
8862,SECT. III.,
8863,SECT. III.,~_Mercury recent in Greece._~
8864,SECT. III.,
8865,SECT. III.,"There is one other point connected with him, which, tending to mark"
8866,SECT. III.,"that he had somewhat recently become known to the Greeks, agrees with"
8867,SECT. III.,"other indications of his introduction from beyond sea. He figures,"
8868,SECT. III.,"indeed, in legends as old as Hercules and Pelops[451]; and we do not"
8869,SECT. III.,"receive any account of his infancy, as we do of the infancy of Dionysus"
8870,SECT. III.,"and of Vulcan. But we may observe that, whenever he assumes human form,"
8871,SECT. III.,it is the form of one scarcely emerging from boyhood. In the last
8872,SECT. III.,"Iliad, he is a πρῶτον ὑπηνήτης, in the fairest flower of youth[452]."
8873,SECT. III.,"And in the Tenth Odyssey, where he makes his second and only other"
8874,SECT. III.,"appearance to a mortal, the same line is repeated in order to describe"
8875,SECT. III.,"his appearance, as if it were an established formula for himself, and"
8876,SECT. III.,not merely adapted to a particular occasion. Indeed it may reasonably
8877,SECT. III.,"be questioned, whether such adaptation exists at all. A very young"
8878,SECT. III.,"person was not the most appropriate conductor for Priam, on such an"
8879,SECT. III.,errand as that which he had undertaken: nor the best instructor in the
8880,SECT. III.,"mode of coping with the formidable Circe. Therefore, without laying"
8881,SECT. III.,"too much stress upon the point, the meaning of the youthful appearance"
8882,SECT. III.,"seems to be, that he was young in the Greek Olympus."

8887,SECT. III.,
8888,SECT. III.,There is yet another sign by which I think we may identify Mercury
8889,SECT. III.,"as, in the estimation of Homer, a deity known to be of foreign"
8890,SECT. III.,introduction. The list given by Jupiter in the Fourteenth Iliad of
8891,SECT. III.,"his intrigues, includes no reference to Maias, the mother of Mercury,"
8892,SECT. III.,or to Diana the mother of Venus. Yet it is a large and elaborately
8893,SECT. III.,"constructed list, ending with Juno herself: and the question arises,"
8894,SECT. III.,"on what principle was it constructed? I think the answer must be that,"
8895,SECT. III.,"as it was addressed to Juno, the most Hellenic of all the Olympian"
8896,SECT. III.,"deities, with whom he wished to be on good terms at the moment, so also"
8897,SECT. III.,"it was intended, if not to give a full account of his Greek intrigues,"
8898,SECT. III.,"yet at any rate that no tradition should appear in it, except such as"
8899,SECT. III.,"Homer considered to be either native, or fully naturalized. It contains"
8900,SECT. III.,"no reference, for example, to the mother of Sarpedon, the mother of"
8901,SECT. III.,"Dardanus, the mother of Amphion and Zethus, the mother of Tantalus,"
8902,SECT. III.,(whom we have however only presumptions for reckoning as by Homeric
8903,SECT. III.,"tradition a son of Jupiter,) or even the mother of Æolus; whom it is"
8904,SECT. III.,"possible that Homer may have regarded as Hellic, rather than properly"
8905,SECT. III.,"Greek, though the father of illustrious Greek houses. If this be the"
8906,SECT. III.,"rule, under which the Poet has framed the list, then the exclusion of"
8907,SECT. III.,Maias and her son remarkably coincides with the other evidence that
8908,SECT. III.,tends to define his position as a deity of known and remembered foreign
8909,SECT. III.,origin.
8910,SECT. III.,
8911,SECT. III.,~_His Olympian office and that of Iris._~
8912,SECT. III.,
8913,SECT. III.,It may be convenient to notice in this place the statement which is
8914,SECT. III.,"commonly made, that Iris is the messenger of the gods in the Iliad,"
8915,SECT. III.,"but that Mercury, except only in the Twenty-fourth Book of that Poem,"
8916,SECT. III.,"is confined in this capacity to the Odyssey: a statement, on which"
8917,SECT. III.,has been founded a standing popular argument against the unity of
8918,SECT. III.,"authorship in the two poems, and also against the genuineness of the"
8919,SECT. III.,Twenty-fourth Iliad itself.
8920,SECT. III.,
8921,SECT. III.,"The statement, however, appears to rest upon a pure misapprehension;"
8922,SECT. III.,for it assumes the identity of the character of Iris and Mercury
8923,SECT. III.,"respectively as messengers. Whereas there is really a difference,"
8924,SECT. III.,corresponding with the difference in dignity between the two deities:
8925,SECT. III.,and Homer is in regard to them perfectly consistent with himself.
8926,SECT. III.,
8927,SECT. III.,"Mercury is sometimes a messenger in the proper sense, and sometimes"
8928,SECT. III.,"an agent, or an agent and messenger combined. It is not true that, so"
8929,SECT. III.,"far as the Iliad is concerned, he only appears in the last Book in"
8930,SECT. III.,"one of these capacities. For in the Second Book[453] we find, that he"
8931,SECT. III.,carried the Pelopid sceptre from Jupiter to Pelops: which may mean
8932,SECT. III.,"either simply, that he was the bearer of it, or that by a commission"
8933,SECT. III.,"he assisted Pelops in acquiring, or rather in founding, the Achæan"
8934,SECT. III.,"throne in the Peloponnesus. In the Twenty-fourth Iliad, Mercury is"
8935,SECT. III.,"not really a messenger at all[454]; but he is an agent, intrusted"
8936,SECT. III.,by Jupiter on the ground of special fitness with the despatch of a
8937,SECT. III.,"delicate and important business, the bringing Priam in safety to the"
8938,SECT. III.,"presence of Achilles, and afterwards the withdrawing him securely from"
8939,SECT. III.,a position of the utmost danger. This is an office like that undertaken
8940,SECT. III.,"by Minerva in the Fourth Book, when, as she was commissioned to bring"
8941,SECT. III.,"about a breach of the Pact by the Trojans, she repaired to Pandarus"
8942,SECT. III.,"for the purpose. But the function of Iris is simply to carry messages,"
8943,SECT. III.,"and chiefly from one deity to another; she is not only ἄγγελος, but"
8944,SECT. III.,μετάγγελος[455]; she is not intrusted in any case with the conduct of
8945,SECT. III.,"transactions among men, or responsible for their issue, although in the"
8946,SECT. III.,Fifteenth Book she spontaneously advises the god Neptune in the sense
8947,SECT. III.,of the message she has brought. It is not for Jupiter only that she
8948,SECT. III.,"acts: she also conveys a message, and a clandestine one, for Juno[456]."
8949,SECT. III.,"Nay, on one occasion, without any divine charge, hearing the prayer"
8950,SECT. III.,"of Achilles to two of the Winds, she spontaneously carries it to the"
8951,SECT. III.,"palace, where they were all feasting together[457]."

8962,SECT. III.,
8963,SECT. III.,Only in the Odyssey do we find Mercury unquestionably and simply
8964,SECT. III.,discharging the duty of a messenger; and this on two occasions: the
8965,SECT. III.,"first, when he brought to Ægisthus the warning that his crimes, if"
8966,SECT. III.,"committed, would be followed by retribution from the hand of Orestes;"
8967,SECT. III.,"the second, when he communicated to Calypso the command to release"
8968,SECT. III.,Ulysses.
8969,SECT. III.,
8970,SECT. III.,But there is in reality no discrepancy whatever between the two poems:
8971,SECT. III.,"inasmuch as Mercury and Iris, though both messengers, act in different"
8972,SECT. III.,"characters. Iris is in one case the spontaneous messenger, who carries"
8973,SECT. III.,a hero’s wish to subordinate deities; but she uniformly has this
8974,SECT. III.,"mark, that she never rises higher than to be the personal messenger"
8975,SECT. III.,"of Jupiter. On the other hand, Mercury in the Odyssey is the official"
8976,SECT. III.,"messenger, not of Jupiter individually, but in both cases of the"
8977,SECT. III.,"Assembly of the gods: and the care, with which the distinction seems"
8978,SECT. III.,"to be drawn, is very remarkable. It is true, the message to Calypso is"
8979,SECT. III.,"called Ζηνὸς ἀγγελίη: but it became the message of Jupiter, because it"
8980,SECT. III.,"was a proposal made by Minerva in the Olympian Assembly, and made on"
8981,SECT. III.,"the part of all in the plural number, which was then duly adopted by"
8982,SECT. III.,Jupiter as the executive head of the body[458]:
8983,SECT. III.,
8984,SECT. III.,[458] Od. i. 84.
8985,SECT. III.,
8986,SECT. III.,"Ἑρμείαν μὲν ἔπειτα, διάκτορον Ἀργειφόντην,"
8987,SECT. III.,νῆσον ἐς Ὠγυγίην ὀτρύνομεν.
8988,SECT. III.,
8989,SECT. III.,The message in the case of Ægisthus is equally well defined[459]:
8990,SECT. III.,
8991,SECT. III.,[459] Od. i. 38.
8992,SECT. III.,
8993,SECT. III.,πρό οἱ εἴπομεν ἡμεῖς
8994,SECT. III.,Ἑρμείαν πέμψαντες.
8995,SECT. III.,
8996,SECT. III.,"It would have been out of keeping, therefore, with the character"
8997,SECT. III.,"and rank of the Homeric Iris, to give her the charge of the messages"
8998,SECT. III.,carried by Mercury. The only case at all analogous in the Iliad is that
8999,SECT. III.,"of the decision in the Fourth Book: and there not Iris, but Minerva"
9000,SECT. III.,"is employed. It is not, however, true that we have in the Odyssey no"
9001,SECT. III.,"recognition of the character of Iris as a messenger. We find one,"
9002,SECT. III.,"and that the plainest of all, in the etymology of the name of Ἶρος"
9003,SECT. III.,"the beggar. His proper name was Arnæus[460]; and he was called Irus,"
9004,SECT. III.,because he was a messenger:
9005,SECT. III.,
9006,SECT. III.,[460] Od. xviii. 6.
9007,SECT. III.,
9008,SECT. III.,"Ἶρον δὲ νέοι κίκλησκον ἅπαντες,"
9009,SECT. III.,"οὕνεκ’ ἀπαγγέλλεσκε κιὼν, ὅτε πού τις ἀνώγοι."
9010,SECT. III.,
9011,SECT. III.,There is yet another illustration of the view which has here been
9012,SECT. III.,"given. In the Assembly of the Twenty-fourth Iliad, Jupiter, in order"
9013,SECT. III.,"to give effect to the general desire of the gods, has occasion to wish"
9014,SECT. III.,for the presence of Thetis: and it has at first sight an odd appearance
9015,SECT. III.,"that he does not, as in other cases where he is acting singly, call"
9016,SECT. III.,"Iris and bid her go: but he says, with a mode of expression not found"
9017,SECT. III.,"elsewhere,"
9018,SECT. III.,
9019,SECT. III.,ἀλλ’ εἴ τις καλέσειε θεῶν Θέτιν....
9020,SECT. III.,
9021,SECT. III.,"And Iris, hearing him, sets forth without being personally designated."
9022,SECT. III.,The peculiar language seems as if it had been employed for the especial
9023,SECT. III.,"purpose of keeping Iris within her own province, and of preventing the"
9024,SECT. III.,possibility of the confusion between her office and that of deities
9025,SECT. III.,"superior in rank, which might have arisen if she had regularly received"
9026,SECT. III.,an errand in the midst of the Olympian Court.
9027,SECT. III.,
9028,SECT. III.,"Thus, then, it would appear, that the apparent discrepancy between the"
9029,SECT. III.,"various parts of the poems, when closely examined, really yields to us"
9030,SECT. III.,fresh evidence of their harmony. Nor let it be thought unworthy of
9031,SECT. III.,Homer thus minutely to preserve the precedence and relative dignity
9032,SECT. III.,"of his deities. With our views of the Olympian scheme, it may require"
9033,SECT. III.,an effort to assume his standing-ground: but when he was dealing
9034,SECT. III.,"with the actual religion of his country, it was just as natural and"
9035,SECT. III.,"needful for him to maintain the ranks and distinctions of the gods,"
9036,SECT. III.,"as of men in their various classes. Mythology might, indeed, afford"
9037,SECT. III.,ample scope to his fancy for free embellishment and enlargement of the
9038,SECT. III.,established traditions; but these processes must always be in the sense
9039,SECT. III.,"of harmonious development, not of discord."
9040,SECT. III.,
9041,SECT. III.,Another question may indeed be asked: whence came this idea of twofold
9042,SECT. III.,"messengership, higher and lower? and would it not have been more"
9043,SECT. III.,natural if the whole of this function had been intrusted to one deity?
9044,SECT. III.,"This question is, I believe, just, and requires that a special account"
9045,SECT. III.,should be given of an arrangement apparently anomalous. Such an account
9046,SECT. III.,"I have endeavoured to supply in treating of Iris, by shewing that she"
9047,SECT. III.,"owes her place to a primeval tradition, while Mercury owes his to an"
9048,SECT. III.,ideal conformity with the laws of the Olympian system.
9049,SECT. III.,
9050,SECT. III.,"And in truth there is no single deity, on whom the stamp of that system"
9051,SECT. III.,has been more legibly impressed. It might be said of the Homeric
9052,SECT. III.,"Mercury, that he exceeds in humanism (to coin a word for the purpose)"
9053,SECT. III.,"the other Olympian gods, as much as they excel the divinities of any"
9054,SECT. III.,"other system. His type is wholly and purely inventive, without a trace"
9055,SECT. III.,"of what is traditional. He represents, so to speak, the utilitarian"
9056,SECT. III.,"side of the human mind, which was of small account in the age of Homer,"
9057,SECT. III.,but has since been more esteemed. In the limitation of his faculties
9058,SECT. III.,"and powers, in the low standard of his moral habits, in the abundant"
9059,SECT. III.,"activity of his appetites, in his indifference, his ease, his good"
9060,SECT. III.,"nature, in the full-blown exhibition of what Christian Theology would"
9061,SECT. III.,"call conformity to the world, he is, as strictly as the nature of"
9062,SECT. III.,"the case admits, a product of the invention of man. He is the god of"
9063,SECT. III.,intercourse on earth; and thus he holds in heaven by mythological
9064,SECT. III.,"title, what came to Iris by primitive tradition. The proof must, I"
9065,SECT. III.,"think, be sufficiently evident, from what has been and will be adduced"
9066,SECT. III.,"piecemeal and by way of contrast, in the accounts of other and, for"
9067,SECT. III.,"that period at least, more important divinities."
9068,SECT. III.,

9072,SECT. III.,
9073,SECT. III.,"There is no deity, except perhaps Dionysus, of whom the position and"
9074,SECT. III.,"estimation in Homer are so vividly contrasted with those, to which he"
9075,SECT. III.,"or she attained in later paganism, as Venus. The Venus of Virgil, the"
9076,SECT. III.,"Venus of Lucretius, are separated by an immeasurable interval from the"
9077,SECT. III.,Aphrodite of Homer. And the manner in which she is treated throughout
9078,SECT. III.,"the Iliad and Odyssey is not only curious, as indicating the nature and"
9079,SECT. III.,"origin of her divinity, but is of very high interest as illustrative of"
9080,SECT. III.,the great Poet’s tone of mind and feeling.
9081,SECT. III.,
9082,SECT. III.,"There is no act of worship or reverence, no sign of awe or deference,"
9083,SECT. III.,shown to her in any part of either of the poems. Yet her rank is
9084,SECT. III.,indisputably elevated. It is beyond doubt that she belongs to the
9085,SECT. III.,"Olympian family. She appears in Olympus, not as specially sent for, but"
9086,SECT. III.,as entitled ordinarily to be there: she takes a side in the war: she
9087,SECT. III.,makes the birth of Æneas more glorious on the mother’s side than that
9088,SECT. III.,"of Achilles, who was sprung from Thetis, the daughter of Nereus, and a"
9089,SECT. III.,"deity of inferior dignity to hers. Not only is Jupiter her father, but"
9090,SECT. III.,her mother Dione is an Olympian goddess. Yet her Olympian rank is ill
9091,SECT. III.,sustained by powers and prerogatives: and she probably owed it to the
9092,SECT. III.,"poetical necessity, which obliged Homer to have an array of divinities"
9093,SECT. III.,"on each side in the war, with some semblance of equality at least"
9094,SECT. III.,between the rival divisions.
9095,SECT. III.,
9096,SECT. III.,The indications of the poem may lead us to believe that her name and
9097,SECT. III.,worship were of recent origin. That a worship of her had begun is
9098,SECT. III.,"obvious: for in Paphos, a town of Cyprus, and the only one named by"
9099,SECT. III.,"Homer, she had both an altar, and a τέμενος, or dedicated estate;"
9100,SECT. III.,and she bears the name of Cypris[461]. But we have only the very
9101,SECT. III.,"slightest mention of her, or of any thing connected with her, in"
9102,SECT. III.,Greece proper. We have seen much reason to assume that Cyprus was
9103,SECT. III.,"essentially Pelasgian, and ethnically more akin to Troy than to"
9104,SECT. III.,Greece. In Troy we find various signs of her influence. She sent to
9105,SECT. III.,Andromache the marriage gift of her κρήδεμνον[462]. She made to Paris
9106,SECT. III.,"the fatal present of his lust[463]. She fell in love with Anchises,"
9107,SECT. III.,and became the mother of Æneas[464]. She led Helen away from the roof
9108,SECT. III.,"of Menelaus[465], and was an object of dread to her when in Troy[466]."
9109,SECT. III.,"Minerva, in taunting her bitterly about her wound, supposes she may"
9110,SECT. III.,"have got it by a scratch from a golden buckle, in undressing some"
9111,SECT. III.,Greek woman that she had persuaded to elope with one of the Trojans
9112,SECT. III.,"whom she so signally loves[467]. Again, it appears from a speech of"
9113,SECT. III.,"Helen, that she was worshipped in Phrygia and Mæonia[468]. The only"
9114,SECT. III.,"token of her influence in Greece is, that she is twice in the Odyssey"
9115,SECT. III.,"called Κυθέρεια. Thus we see her not strictly within Greece, but rather"
9116,SECT. III.,"advanced some steps on her way to it. And it is easy to suppose that,"
9117,SECT. III.,"in the race of corruption, her worship would run among the fastest."

9137,SECT. III.,
9138,SECT. III.,"The negative evidence, then, thus far tends to the belief that Venus"
9139,SECT. III.,was not yet established among the regular deities of the Poet’s
9140,SECT. III.,countrymen: and it is supported by positive testimony. For some of
9141,SECT. III.,"the functions, that must in the post-Homeric view of her office have"
9142,SECT. III.,"belonged to her, Homer studiously makes other provision. Of this"
9143,SECT. III.,there is a most remarkable case in the Odyssey. He designs that the
9144,SECT. III.,"Suitors, before they are put to death, shall be made to yield of their"
9145,SECT. III.,"substance to the house of Ulysses, in the form of gifts to Penelope."
9146,SECT. III.,"For this purpose he arrays her in all her charms, and brings her forth"
9147,SECT. III.,"in appearance like Diana, or golden Venus[469]. It is not a common"
9148,SECT. III.,practice with Homer to compare a beautiful Greek woman to Venus;
9149,SECT. III.,"especially when it is one so matronlike as Penelope. On the other hand,"
9150,SECT. III.,the comparison of Cassandra to Venus[470] is entirely in keeping with
9151,SECT. III.,the Asiatic character of the deity. But the intention of the allusion
9152,SECT. III.,"here is manifest: for when the Suitors see her, it is passion which"
9153,SECT. III.,prompts them to vie with one another in courting her favour through the
9154,SECT. III.,"medium of costly gifts. How, then, came the sad Penelope thus to deck"
9155,SECT. III.,"herself? It was not her own thought: it was the suggestion of a deity,"
9156,SECT. III.,and if Venus had been recognised by Homer as an established object of
9157,SECT. III.,"worship in Greece, Venus would most properly have made the suggestion:"
9158,SECT. III.,"for she, says Achilles, is supreme in beauty, as Minerva is in industry"
9159,SECT. III.,and skill[471]. But it is Minerva who instils this suggestion into
9160,SECT. III.,the mind of Penelope; though in a form which conveys no taint to her
9161,SECT. III.,"mind[472]. She goes, however, beyond this: for she sends Penelope to"
9162,SECT. III.,"sleep, and then, to enhance her beauty, applies to her face a wash,"
9163,SECT. III.,of the kind that Venus herself uses when she goes among the Graces.
9164,SECT. III.,"Yet this is not procured from Venus, as Juno in the Iliad procures the"
9165,SECT. III.,_cestus_ from her on Mount Olympus; nor is her agency or aid in any
9166,SECT. III.,"manner employed. Thus she is not allowed, as it were, to have to do"
9167,SECT. III.,"in any manner with Penelope; a clear indication, I think, that though"
9168,SECT. III.,"known, she was not yet worshipped in Greece proper."

9184,SECT. III.,
9185,SECT. III.,"Again, the predicaments in which she is exhibited in the poems are"
9186,SECT. III.,"of a kind hardly reconcilable with the supposition, that she was an"
9187,SECT. III.,"acknowledged Greek deity at the time. In the lay of Demodocus, the Poet"
9188,SECT. III.,"seems to intend to make the guilty pair ridiculous, from his sending"
9189,SECT. III.,"them off, when released, so rapidly and in silence. It is true that"
9190,SECT. III.,he exhibits to us in the Iliad the sensual passion of Jupiter: but he
9191,SECT. III.,"has wreathed the passage where it is described in imagery, both of"
9192,SECT. III.,"wonderful beauty, and rather more elaborate than is his wont[474]."
9193,SECT. III.,"But whatever may be thought of the Eighth Odyssey, the Fifth and"
9194,SECT. III.,"Twenty-first Iliad seem, so far as Venus is concerned, only to permit"
9195,SECT. III.,"one construction. In the former, she is, after being wounded, both"
9196,SECT. III.,"menaced and ridiculed by Diomed[475]. In the latter, for no other"
9197,SECT. III.,"offence than leading the battered Mars off the field, she is followed"
9198,SECT. III.,"by Minerva, and struck to the ground by a blow upon the breast. As"
9199,SECT. III.,"in the case of Mars, so and more decidedly in the case of Venus, it"
9200,SECT. III.,"appears as if the ignominious treatment in the Theomachy was difficult,"
9201,SECT. III.,"and the wounding and treatment by Diomed quite impossible, to reconcile"
9202,SECT. III.,"with the idea that it could have been devised by a Poet, and recited"
9203,SECT. III.,"to audiences, for whom the personages so handled formed a part of the"
9204,SECT. III.,established objects of religious veneration. Even Helen is permitted
9205,SECT. III.,"to taunt her bitterly: to recommend her becoming the wife, or even the"
9206,SECT. III.,"slave, of Paris, and her ceasing to make pretensions to play the part"
9207,SECT. III.,of a deity:

9217,SECT. III.,~_Her advance from the East._~
9218,SECT. III.,
9219,SECT. III.,"In entire harmony with these suppositions is, first, the side taken"
9220,SECT. III.,"by her in the war; and secondly, the geographical indications of her"
9221,SECT. III.,worship. It appears to have moved from the East along that double
9222,SECT. III.,"line, by which we have found it probable that the Pelasgians flowed"
9223,SECT. III.,"into Europe: one the way of the islands at the base of the Ægean, the"
9224,SECT. III.,"other by the Hellespont. We know, from other sources, that the East"
9225,SECT. III.,engendered at a very early date creations of this kind. Under the names
9226,SECT. III.,"of Astarte, Mylitta, Mitra, and the like, we seem to encounter so many"
9227,SECT. III.,separate forms or versions of the Greek Venus. We may indeed observe
9228,SECT. III.,"that Astarte was commonly associated with the Moon, and it would be a"
9229,SECT. III.,matter of interest to know the original relation between the popular
9230,SECT. III.,"or promiscuous Venus (πάνδημος), and the celestial one. In Homer we"
9231,SECT. III.,find them completely severed: we perceive Artemis with many traces of
9232,SECT. III.,"the older, and Aphrodite fully representing the more recent and carnal"
9233,SECT. III.,conception. There still remains one sign of correspondence; it is the
9234,SECT. III.,"standing epithet of χρυσέη for Aphrodite, compared with the cluster"
9235,SECT. III.,"of golden epithets[477] applied to Diana. We may not unreasonably, I"
9236,SECT. III.,"think, take Artemis as the probable prototype; and Aphrodite as the"
9237,SECT. III.,"sensual image, into which the old and pure conception had already"
9238,SECT. III.,"degenerated, before the time when the two fell, as poetic material,"
9239,SECT. III.,"each for its own purpose, into the moulding hand of Homer. While such a"
9240,SECT. III.,"source is every way probable, our reference to it is the more natural,"
9241,SECT. III.,because it is not very easy to attribute to the Greeks of the heroic
9242,SECT. III.,age the original conception of such a divinity as Venus. For though
9243,SECT. III.,"they were of social and therefore somewhat jovial habits, and though"
9244,SECT. III.,"they were a race of ready hand, given to crimes of violence, yet they"
9245,SECT. III.,"were not, on the whole, by any means a sensual race, in relation to the"
9246,SECT. III.,"standard which seems to have governed the Asiatic nations, whether we"
9247,SECT. III.,"estimate these latter the Trojans, the Assyrians, or the Jews."

9251,SECT. III.,"The marriage with Vulcan, and the relation to a mother Dione, invented"
9252,SECT. III.,"apparently for the purpose of maternity, are marks of recency. If I"
9253,SECT. III.,"have rightly referred Vulcan to the Phœnician order, this marriage may"
9254,SECT. III.,"be an indication that Venus likewise had a place in it: and again,"
9255,SECT. III.,"considering her station in Troas, it seems not impossible that the"
9256,SECT. III.,"worship of Vulcan may have been introduced there the more readily,"
9257,SECT. III.,because of his being reputed to be her husband.
9258,SECT. III.,
9259,SECT. III.,"Like Maias the mother of Mercury, Dione, the mother of Venus, is"
9260,SECT. III.,excluded from the list of Jupiter’s amorous or matrimonial connections
9261,SECT. III.,"in the Fourteenth Iliad (312-28). This leads to the conclusion, either"
9262,SECT. III.,"that the tradition respecting her was known only as a foreign one, or"
9263,SECT. III.,"else that it was recent, slight, and as yet unauthenticated in popular"
9264,SECT. III.,belief. In either view it coincides with the other indications as to
9265,SECT. III.,Venus.

9267,SECT. III.,~_Her rank and personal character._~
9268,SECT. III.,
9269,SECT. III.,"The primary function of Venus, apart from Asia, appears to lie among"
9270,SECT. III.,"the Olympian deities. That she was, as a member of that family,"
9271,SECT. III.,"in actual exercise of her prerogatives, we see plainly from the"
9272,SECT. III.,application made by Juno to her in order to obtain the grace and
9273,SECT. III.,"attractiveness, by which she hoped to act upon the mind of Jupiter. As"
9274,SECT. III.,"a mythological conception, she exhibits to us on the page of Homer the"
9275,SECT. III.,"union of the most finished material beauty with strong sensuality, and"
9276,SECT. III.,the entire absence of all traces of the ethical element. She represents
9277,SECT. III.,"two things, form and passion; the former refined, the latter not so. In"
9278,SECT. III.,"her character, as conceived by Homer, we see how that which is divine,"
9279,SECT. III.,"when it has ceased to be divine, becomes, not human, but something"
9280,SECT. III.,much worse and baser: as he that falls from a height cannot stop
9281,SECT. III.,"half-way down the precipice at his will, but must reach the ground."
9282,SECT. III.,Even feminine tenderness does not cling to the character of Venus. She
9283,SECT. III.,"is effeminate, indeed, for when wounded she lets her son Æneas fall:"
9284,SECT. III.,"but gentle she is not, for in the scene of the Third Iliad with Helen"
9285,SECT. III.,"her conduct is harsh even to brutality, and she drives the reluctant"
9286,SECT. III.,princess into sensuality only by the cruel threat of violence and
9287,SECT. III.,death[478].

9293,SECT. III.,imperfectly exercised[479]. She does not pretend to give strength or
9294,SECT. III.,"courage to her son Æneas, but is represented simply as carrying him off"
9295,SECT. III.,"in her arms. It is here worthy of remark, that she has not even the"
9296,SECT. III.,"ability, like the greater deities, to envelop him in cloud: she has"
9297,SECT. III.,"no command over nature, only over the corrupt and rebellious impulses"
9298,SECT. III.,"of man: she has power to carry Æneas away, but he is folded in her"
9299,SECT. III.,"mantle[480]. In fact, her privileges in general appear to be like those"
9300,SECT. III.,"of the inferior orders of deity, held and used for her own enjoyment;"
9301,SECT. III.,"but they do not carry the power of acting upon man or nature, except"
9302,SECT. III.,in a particular and prescribed function. Her capacity of locomotion
9303,SECT. III.,"is limited in a peculiar degree. Mars, though no great deity, went,"
9304,SECT. III.,"when wounded, up to heaven on the clouds. But Venus required to borrow"
9305,SECT. III.,"the disengaged chariot of Mars for the purpose, when in the same"
9306,SECT. III.,predicament[481].

9313,SECT. III.,
9314,SECT. III.,"It is no wonder that the ancient, probably the earliest Greek, account"
9315,SECT. III.,"of her origin which is given by Hesiod[482], should mark her as of"
9316,SECT. III.,entirely animal extraction.
9317,SECT. III.,
9318,SECT. III.,[482] Theog. 188-98.
9319,SECT. III.,
9320,SECT. III.,"Another peculiarity in the case of Venus is, that she already takes"
9321,SECT. III.,"her name, and not only receives mere epithets, from two particular"
9322,SECT. III.,"spots where she is worshipped. Cyprus makes her Κύπρις in the Iliad,"
9323,SECT. III.,and from Cythera she is also Cytherea in the Odyssey. She thus stands
9324,SECT. III.,"distinct from Juno: to whom the Argeian name is simply an appendage,"
9325,SECT. III.,"though one of a most characteristic force, and one involving important"
9326,SECT. III.,"inferences as to her origin. Nor is she less distinct from Minerva,"
9327,SECT. III.,"whose name is not derivative in form when she is called Ἀθήνη, and whom"
9328,SECT. III.,"we must consider as the eponymist of Athens, and not its namesake. No"
9329,SECT. III.,"indication could be of greater force, than this marked localism, in"
9330,SECT. III.,stamping the ideas about Venus as purely human in their origin.
9331,SECT. III.,
9332,SECT. III.,~_Venus unable to confer beauty._~
9333,SECT. III.,
9334,SECT. III.,It would be an error to consider the Venus of Homer as even the goddess
9335,SECT. III.,"of beauty. She was endowed with it personally, and she possessed the"
9336,SECT. III.,_cestus_ of fascination and desire: but she had no capacity to make
9337,SECT. III.,"mortals beautiful, such as Minerva exercised upon Penelope and Ulysses,"
9338,SECT. III.,and Juno upon the virgin daughters of Pandareus. She is there passed
9339,SECT. III.,by in such a manner as to make it plain that she did not possess any
9340,SECT. III.,"power of imparting this gift. Her δῶρα, in Il. iii. 65, do not appear"
9341,SECT. III.,"to include it; or Paris would not say, ‘no one would spontaneously seek"
9342,SECT. III.,them.’ For beauty of person was among the recognised and highly valued
9343,SECT. III.,gifts of heaven[483].
9344,SECT. III.,
9345,SECT. III.,[483] Od. viii. 167-77.
9346,SECT. III.,
9347,SECT. III.,"We are told, in the Twentieth Odyssey, that Venus fed the orphan girls"
9348,SECT. III.,"of Pandareus with cheese, honey, and wine; and, continues the passage,"
9349,SECT. III.,"Juno gave them extraordinary beauty and prudence, Diana lofty stature,"
9350,SECT. III.,"Minerva industrial skill. Afterwards, they being thus equipped, Venus"
9351,SECT. III.,went up to Olympus to pray Jupiter that he would make arrangements for
9352,SECT. III.,their marriage[484]. Thus her operations in a work of good are wholly
9353,SECT. III.,ministerial and inferior: and not only does she not confer beauty
9354,SECT. III.,"herself, but she sees it conferred by Juno. This again shows that the"
9355,SECT. III.,"Venus of Homer, except for evil, has no power to work upon the body or"
9356,SECT. III.,mind of man.
9357,SECT. III.,
9358,SECT. III.,[484] Od. xx. 66-75.
9359,SECT. III.,
9360,SECT. III.,But we must not omit to mark that sign of the real chastity of Homer’s
9361,SECT. III.,mind which he has given us by his method of handling the character of
9362,SECT. III.,Venus; a deity whom the nature of his subject in the Iliad would have
9363,SECT. III.,"led almost any other heathen, and many Christian, poets to magnify."
9364,SECT. III.,
9365,SECT. III.,In not a single instance does Homer exhibit this divinity to us in an
9366,SECT. III.,"amiable or engaging light, or invest her with the attractions of power,"
9367,SECT. III.,"glory, and success."
9368,SECT. III.,
9369,SECT. III.,"When Minerva advises Diomed in the Fifth Iliad[485], she says, Do _not_"
9370,SECT. III.,"attack any of the immortals; but if you happen to see Venus, her you"
9371,SECT. III.,"may wound. We seem to have a clear indication, that Homer introduced"
9372,SECT. III.,this passage simply in order to throw contempt on Venus; because
9373,SECT. III.,"afterwards, when Mars is in the field, and Diomed pleads the inhibition"
9374,SECT. III.,"he had received as a reason for his inaction, Minerva at once removes"
9375,SECT. III.,"it, and bids the warrior assail that god without scruple[486]."

9381,SECT. III.,"Again, when Diomed wounds Mars, it is because Minerva invisibly directs"
9382,SECT. III.,and impels his lance[487]: but he wounds Venus without any aid. In the
9383,SECT. III.,"Theomachy, she appears upon the list of deities enumerated as taking"
9384,SECT. III.,the Greek and Trojan side respectively; but when the Poet comes to
9385,SECT. III.,"match the others for fight, she disappears from his mind; as though it"
9386,SECT. III.,would have been an insult to any other member of the Olympian family to
9387,SECT. III.,"be pitted against her effeminacy. Accordingly, no antagonist is named"
9388,SECT. III.,for her.

9391,SECT. III.,
9392,SECT. III.,"She is sometimes made contemptible, as in the foregoing instances. She"
9393,SECT. III.,"is at other times silly and childish, as under the bitter taunt of"
9394,SECT. III.,"Minerva and the admonition of Jupiter[488], and again, when she falls"
9395,SECT. III.,into the trap cunningly laid by Juno[489]. Odious in the interview with

9404,SECT. III.,
9405,SECT. III.,"Again, there is not, throughout the Odyssey or Iliad, a single"
9406,SECT. III.,"description of the beauty of Venus, such as Homer has given us of the"
9407,SECT. III.,"dress of Juno, or the arms of Minerva. It is never, either directly or"
9408,SECT. III.,"indirectly, set off for the purpose of creating interest and favour."
9409,SECT. III.,"One exception may perhaps be alleged: but, if it is such, at least it"
9410,SECT. III.,affords the most marked illustration of the rule. Once he does praise
9411,SECT. III.,"the exceeding beauteous neck, the lovely breast, the sparkling eyes of"
9412,SECT. III.,Venus; but it is when he has clothed her in the withered form of the
9413,SECT. III.,"aged spinstress that had attended upon Helen from Sparta, and through"
9414,SECT. III.,whose uninviting exterior such glimpses of the latent shape of Venus
9415,SECT. III.,"are caught by Helen as to enable her, but no one else, to recognise the"
9416,SECT. III.,deity.
9417,SECT. III.,
9418,SECT. III.,"How different is this from the case of Virgil, who has introduced a"
9419,SECT. III.,"most beautiful and winning description of her in the Second Æneid[490],"
9420,SECT. III.,just when he brings her into action that she may acquit both Helen
9421,SECT. III.,and Paris of all responsibility for the fall of Troy. It would have
9422,SECT. III.,"been not only natural for Homer, but, unless he was restrained by some"
9423,SECT. III.,"strong reason, we may almost say it would have been inevitable, that he"
9424,SECT. III.,"should have done for Venus what has been done in our own day, with very"

9447,SECT. III.,
9448,SECT. III.,"Besides Juno and Bacchus, Hephæstus or Vulcan is the only Homeric"
9449,SECT. III.,"deity who bears upon him this unequivocal, or at least significant,"
9450,SECT. III.,"mark of novelty, that we are supplied with a distinct tradition of his"
9451,SECT. III.,childhood[491]. In his youth he was rickety and lame. His mother Juno
9452,SECT. III.,"wished to conceal him, and she let him fall into the sea. Here Thetis"
9453,SECT. III.,"and Eurynome received him, and reared him in a submarine cave, not,"
9454,SECT. III.,"however, under the Mediterranean, but the Ocean; and in that cave for"
9455,SECT. III.,nine years the boy-smith employed himself in making ornaments for women.
9456,SECT. III.,
9457,SECT. III.,[491] Od. viii. 311: and Il. xviii. 395.
9458,SECT. III.,
9459,SECT. III.,He is thus associated by his traditions with the two opposing elements
9460,SECT. III.,"of water and fire; with water by the history of his childhood, and"
9461,SECT. III.,with fire as the grand instrument and condition of his art. The latter
9462,SECT. III.,"was by much the stronger association, for it was continually fed by"
9463,SECT. III.,the history and progress of the art itself; so that he became the
9464,SECT. III.,"impersonation of that element itself, and in the phrase φλὸξ Ἡφαίστοιο"
9465,SECT. III.,it is his name which gives the distinctive force; for φλὸξ in Homer
9466,SECT. III.,"seems to mean the flame or light of fire[492], and is not used to"
9467,SECT. III.,"signify fire proper, except with some other word in conjunction to it"
9468,SECT. III.,or near it. But the explanation of the seeming contrariety is probably
9469,SECT. III.,"to be found in the hypothesis, that his worship was of Phœnician"
9470,SECT. III.,introduction; as the Phœnicians seem to have made the Greeks acquainted
9471,SECT. III.,with the use of fire in working metals. If they made the deity known
9472,SECT. III.,"to the Greeks, this will account for his association with the idea of"
9473,SECT. III.,"fire: and as accounts and traditions, which they had supplied, were"
9474,SECT. III.,evidently the source of all the more remote maritime delineations of
9475,SECT. III.,"Homer, (since they alone frequented Ocean and the distant seas,) this"
9476,SECT. III.,is the natural and easy explanation for the tradition of his childish
9477,SECT. III.,"arts in the oceanic cave. That he is thus, like the Phœnicians, for"
9478,SECT. III.,"Homer, the meeting point of fire and water, appears clearly to stamp"
9479,SECT. III.,"him as Phœnician or oriental in his origin, relatively to Greece."
9480,SECT. III.,
9481,SECT. III.,"[492] Thus, in Il. xviii. 206, it means that blaze without heat, as"
9482,SECT. III.,"from shining armour, with which Minerva invested Achilles when he went"
9483,SECT. III.,forth unarmed. The name Ἥφαιστος also stands alone for fire in Il. ii.
9484,SECT. III.,426.
9485,SECT. III.,
9486,SECT. III.,"Accordingly, true to the association between Phœnician and Hellenic"
9487,SECT. III.,"elements, he is one of the five Hellenizing deities in the Trojan war;"
9488,SECT. III.,"in which, as the element of fire, he opposes and subdues the river"
9489,SECT. III.,"Xanthus. He was not, however, unknown to the Trojans; for Dares, his"
9490,SECT. III.,"priest, had two sons in their army. His introduction to Troas may have"
9491,SECT. III.,been due to his conjugal connection with Venus; or it may have been
9492,SECT. III.,"due to the neighbourhood of Lemnos, the island on which, when hurled"
9493,SECT. III.,"from Olympus by Jupiter, he fell, and which thenceforward formed his"
9494,SECT. III.,favourite earthly habitation. With Lemnos and other isles Troy was in
9495,SECT. III.,"communication, at least from the time of Laomedon, for that prince"
9496,SECT. III.,"threatened to seize Apollo and to sell him, νήσων ἔπι τηλεδαπάων[493]."
9497,SECT. III.,A regular commerce was established between Lemnos and the camp during

9503,SECT. III.,
9504,SECT. III.,Among the deities of Vulcan’s generation we find but one married
9505,SECT. III.,"couple, and they are a strangely assorted pair, Vulcan himself and"
9506,SECT. III.,Venus. Neither character nor occupation will account for this singular
9507,SECT. III.,"union: on the contrary, there is no case in which the extremes of"
9508,SECT. III.,repugnance must so decidedly be supposed. It is questionable whether
9509,SECT. III.,"the hypothesis, that Venus represents the beauty which gives perfection"
9510,SECT. III.,"to works of art, is in entire keeping with the tone of the Homeric"
9511,SECT. III.,"system. Indeed Venus with Homer represents absolutely nothing, except"
9512,SECT. III.,sensual passion in a fine exterior form which can hardly be severed
9513,SECT. III.,"from it. One explanation, and one only, may suggest itself as more"
9514,SECT. III.,natural. It is this: that the worship of Vulcan and that of Venus
9515,SECT. III.,"came in, not distinctly connected with those of any other deity, at"
9516,SECT. III.,"about the same time, and from the same quarter. We have already seen"
9517,SECT. III.,"upon Venus those marks of comparative modernism, and of an eastern"
9518,SECT. III.,"extraction, which we now find in Vulcan; and here probably is to be"
9519,SECT. III.,"found, either wholly or in part, the actuating suggestion of their"
9520,SECT. III.,ill-starred wedlock.
9521,SECT. III.,
9522,SECT. III.,"Though we find the works of Vulcan scattered promiscuously abroad,"
9523,SECT. III.,"there is no notice of his worship, or of any site or endowment"
9524,SECT. III.,belonging to him in the Greece of Homer. He was available to the Poet
9525,SECT. III.,"for embellishment, but he probably had not become for the Greek nation"
9526,SECT. III.,a regular object of adoration.
9527,SECT. III.,
9528,SECT. III.,I think we may trace the tokens of his eastern origin in the legend of
9529,SECT. III.,"his infancy. It was into the sea that he was thrown: but, as we have"
9530,SECT. III.,"seen, the cave in which he was reared was a cave of Ocean[495]."

9537,SECT. III.,"Also, by a rather singular arrangement, there are two deities, not one"
9538,SECT. III.,"only, employed in taking him up and watching over his childhood. Nor"
9539,SECT. III.,are the two naturally associated together: for Thetis is a daughter of
9540,SECT. III.,"Nereus, and belongs to the Thalassian family; Eurynome is a child of"
9541,SECT. III.,Ocean. The connection with Thetis and the sea is appropriate enough in
9542,SECT. III.,"the case of any child of Juno, for the wife of Peleus, as his nurse,"
9543,SECT. III.,seems to give him an Hellenic character: but it seems hard to explain
9544,SECT. III.,"the appointment of a colleague belonging to the race of Ocean, and for"
9545,SECT. III.,"the situation of the cave in its bed, except as having been due to the"
9546,SECT. III.,"eastern origin of the divinity, of which the mark had not yet been"
9547,SECT. III.,effaced.

9549,SECT. III.,~_His marriage with Venus._~
9550,SECT. III.,
9551,SECT. III.,"The marriage of Venus and Vulcan, metaphysically interpreted,"
9552,SECT. III.,represents the union of strength and skill in the production of works
9553,SECT. III.,of art: but though this may have been a Greek application of eastern
9554,SECT. III.,"traditions originally independent, there is no distinct trace of it in"
9555,SECT. III.,"Homer; while it may seem strange that, if the Poet had had such an idea"
9556,SECT. III.,"before his mind, his only picture of their conjugal relation should"
9557,SECT. III.,"have been the one given in the Eighth Odyssey. Still, he may have had"
9558,SECT. III.,that idea.
9559,SECT. III.,
9560,SECT. III.,"Vulcan’s other wife, Charis, represents an exactly similar conception;"
9561,SECT. III.,and here there is a more obvious probability that the combination was
9562,SECT. III.,"Greek, and was one intended, or even devised, by Homer."
9563,SECT. III.,
9564,SECT. III.,It is common to treat the handling of this subject in the Iliad as in
9565,SECT. III.,contradiction with that of the Odyssey; and to use the assumption of
9566,SECT. III.,"discrepancy either in support of the doctrine of the Chorizontes, or in"
9567,SECT. III.,proof that the Olympian lay of Demodocus is spurious.
9568,SECT. III.,
9569,SECT. III.,"Without entering into that controversy, I venture to urge that the"
9570,SECT. III.,proof is insufficient. Why should the Vulcan of Homer be limited to
9571,SECT. III.,"a single spouse? Jupiter has three, probably four; namely, Juno,"
9572,SECT. III.,"Latona, Dione, and Ceres. No other Olympian deity, until we come down"
9573,SECT. III.,"to Vulcan, has any. The question then arises, Why should the poets,"
9574,SECT. III.,"or even the religion of the day, be limited in this case to monogamy,"
9575,SECT. III.,which has no place elsewhere in the Olympian family? Why should the
9576,SECT. III.,"reasons, which induced the framers of the religion to give him a wife"
9577,SECT. III.,"at all, forbid them absolutely from giving him more than one? Nay more;"
9578,SECT. III.,"why, if the original object of the Greek mind in this marriage was to"
9579,SECT. III.,"symbolize the union of manual skill and beauty, and if the materials"
9580,SECT. III.,"of the received mythology were in a state of growth and progress,"
9581,SECT. III.,"might it not happen that in the youth of Homer Charis was, all things"
9582,SECT. III.,"considered, suited to afford the most appropriate means of representing"
9583,SECT. III.,"the idea, and yet that in his later age he might amend his own plan,"
9584,SECT. III.,"and make Venus the wife of Vulcan, without at all troubling himself"
9585,SECT. III.,to consider what was to become of the slightly sketched image that he
9586,SECT. III.,"had previously presented in the Iliad? I say this, because the assumed"
9587,SECT. III.,contradiction of these legends appears to me to proceed upon another
9588,SECT. III.,"assumption of a false principle; namely, that, though the mythology was"
9589,SECT. III.,"continually changing with the progress of the country, yet each poet"
9590,SECT. III.,"was bound, even in its secondary and in its most poetical parts, to a"
9591,SECT. III.,"rigid uniformity of statement. No one, I think, who considers how the"
9592,SECT. III.,current of the really theistic and religious ideas runs upon a very
9593,SECT. III.,"few of the greater gods, can fail to see that with Homer the religious"
9594,SECT. III.,"meaning of his Vulcan, and of the other gods of the second order, was"
9595,SECT. III.,"very slight. A sufficient proof of this may be found in the fact, that"
9596,SECT. III.,"of no one of them, excepting Mercury alone, does he mention the actual"
9597,SECT. III.,worship in his own country.
9598,SECT. III.,
9599,SECT. III.,"Moreover, two things may deserve remark with reference to the variation"
9600,SECT. III.,"which makes Charis the wife of Vulcan in the Iliad, and Venus in the"
9601,SECT. III.,Odyssey.
9602,SECT. III.,
9603,SECT. III.,"First, from the plan of the Iliad, which placed Venus and Vulcan in"
9604,SECT. III.,"the sharpest opposition, the conjugal relation between them would have"
9605,SECT. III.,"been, for that poem, inadmissible. The Poet could not have introduced"
9606,SECT. III.,"Venus, where he has introduced Charis: and he must thus have given up a"
9607,SECT. III.,"strikingly poetical picture, and one most descriptive of the works of"
9608,SECT. III.,high art in metal.
9609,SECT. III.,
9610,SECT. III.,"Secondly, it may not be certain, but it is by no means improbable,"
9611,SECT. III.,that the worship of Venus may have attained to much wider vogue in
9612,SECT. III.,"Greece when Homer composed the Odyssey, than at the period when he"
9613,SECT. III.,gave birth to the Iliad. We have seen already the signs that it was a
9614,SECT. III.,recent worship. We have seen it in Cyprus and then more advanced in
9615,SECT. III.,"Cythera, not in continental Greece. Now it was in the Iliad that Venus"
9616,SECT. III.,had the name of Cypris; in the Odyssey this is exchanged for Cytherea:
9617,SECT. III.,"that is to say, she was known sometime before as a goddess worshipped"
9618,SECT. III.,"in Cyprus and not properly Greek; but she was now, such is the"
9619,SECT. III.,"probable construction, known also as a goddess worshipped in Cythera,"
9620,SECT. III.,"and therefore become Greek. On this account, as well as because the"
9621,SECT. III.,"opposition between them had disappeared, she might with poetical"
9622,SECT. III.,"propriety be made to bear a character in the Odyssey, which could not"
9623,SECT. III.,attach to her during the continuance of the great Trojan quarrel.
9624,SECT. III.,
9625,SECT. III.,~_Vulcan in and out of his art._~
9626,SECT. III.,
9627,SECT. III.,"Beyond his own function as god of fire, and of metallic art in"
9628,SECT. III.,"connection with it, Vulcan is nobody. But within it he is supreme, and"
9629,SECT. III.,no deity can rival him in his own kind. His animated works of metal
9630,SECT. III.,are among the boldest figures of poetry. Even his lameness is propped
9631,SECT. III.,"by bronze damsels of his own manufacture. And the lock, which he puts"
9632,SECT. III.,"for Juno on her chamber-door, is one that not even any other deity can"
9633,SECT. III.,open[496]. But this is not so much an exemplification of the power

9650,SECT. III.,of its progress. It lies before us like the honeycomb in the glass

9652,SECT. III.,"himself the queen bee. The Philosopher did not then exist. The Priest,"
9653,SECT. III.,"we know, was not a religious teacher. The Seer or Prophet interpreted"
9654,SECT. III.,"the Divine will only for the particular case, and did not rise to"
9655,SECT. III.,"generalization. Who was it, then, that gathered up the thoughts and"
9656,SECT. III.,"arrested the feelings of the general mind, and that, reducing the crude"
9657,SECT. III.,"material to form and beauty, made it a mythology? The answer can only"
9658,SECT. III.,"be, that for the heroic age it was the Bard."
9659,SECT. III.,
9660,SECT. III.,"In some of the varying statements of the poems, where others have"

9662,SECT. III.,"particular parts, I cannot but rather see the formative mind exercising"
9663,SECT. III.,its discretion over a subject-matter where it was as yet supreme:
9664,SECT. III.,"namely, over that large class of objects which afforded fitting clay"
9665,SECT. III.,"for the hand of the artist, but which had not yet become a stamped and"
9666,SECT. III.,"recognised image for popular veneration. In the Charis, who is the wife"
9667,SECT. III.,"of Hellenizing Vulcan, so long as Venus is at war with the Greeks;"
9668,SECT. III.,"in the Winds, who, according to the Odyssey, inhabit a bag under the"
9669,SECT. III.,"custody of a living person, possibly a mortal, but who in the Iliad"
9670,SECT. III.,"beget children, enjoy banquets, and receive a _cultus_; we find Homer,"
9671,SECT. III.,"as I conceive, following the genial flow of his thought, according"
9672,SECT. III.,"as his subject prompted him, and awarding honour and preferment, or"
9673,SECT. III.,"withholding it, as occasion served. Perhaps Mercury or Vulcan, perhaps"
9674,SECT. III.,"even Juno or Neptune, may owe him some advancement: but, at any rate,"
9675,SECT. III.,he seems almost as distinctly to show us Ἠέλιος in two different stages

9746,SECT. III.,The Olympian rank of the Sun is clear; but there seem to be ascriptions
9747,SECT. III.,"made to him, which can only be reconciled by the supposition, in itself"
9748,SECT. III.,"far from improbable, that he was separately known of, as an object"
9749,SECT. III.,"of worship, through two different sets of traditions; one of them"
9750,SECT. III.,"referable to Pelasgian sources, and entailing Trojan sympathies, the"
9751,SECT. III.,"other of an Hellenic, or very probably a Phœnician, cast, and tending"
9752,SECT. III.,to rank him with the Hellenes. For in the Iliad his unwillingness to
9753,SECT. III.,"set, when his setting was to bring the glories of the Trojans to an"
9754,SECT. III.,"end, seems very strongly to imply that he had a Pelasgian origin. In"
9755,SECT. III.,"the Odyssey, his siding with Vulcan against Mars and Venus would show,"
9756,SECT. III.,"so far as it goes, a Hellenizing turn; but what is more important is"
9757,SECT. III.,"this, that, as the father of Circe and Æetes, of whom the latter bears"
9758,SECT. III.,"the exclusively Phœnician epithet ὀλοόφρων, and the former has her"
9759,SECT. III.,"abode close by his ἀντολαὶ, or point of rising, he is at once thrown"
9760,SECT. III.,into the Phœnician or the Persian connection. As the Sun-worship was so
9761,SECT. III.,"general in the East, it seems quite possible that it might come into"
9762,SECT. III.,Greece by more channels than one: and as the process of personification
9763,SECT. III.,"might in one set of traditions be more, and in another less complete,"
9764,SECT. III.,we may here find a possible clue to Homer’s reason for treating it
9765,SECT. III.,differently in the two poems. Particularly as the poem where he is
9766,SECT. III.,"least personal, the Iliad, is also that where he is most Pelasgian: for"
9767,SECT. III.,we have found reason to ascribe to the Pelasgians less of lively and
9768,SECT. III.,"creative power in the realms of the imagination, than to the Hellenes,"
9769,SECT. III.,and to such races as had stronger affinities with them.
9770,SECT. III.,
9771,SECT. III.,"So distinct is the Sun from Apollo in the Odyssey, that they appear"
9772,SECT. III.,as separate _dramatis personæ_ in the Lay of Demodocus. Yet there are
9773,SECT. III.,some latent signs of sympathy between them. Apollo tends the oxen of
9774,SECT. III.,"Laomedon: the Sun delights, morning and evening, in his own oxen in"
9775,SECT. III.,Thrinacie. It is difficult to avoid supposing some kind of relation to
9776,SECT. III.,"be conveyed by Homer between the rays of the sun, and the arrows of"
9777,SECT. III.,Apollo in the Plague. The extension of his sympathies to both races is
9778,SECT. III.,"another sign of resemblance. Again, we have a promise from Eurylochus,"
9779,SECT. III.,"one of the crew of Ulysses, to build a temple to the Sun upon his safe"
9780,SECT. III.,return to Ithaca[503]. Now we have seen that the only instances of
9781,SECT. III.,"temples, which we can certainly declare to be named in the poems, are"
9782,SECT. III.,temples either of Minerva or of Apollo. Thus this vow of Eurylochus
9783,SECT. III.,looks like another anticipation of the subsequent absorption of the
9784,SECT. III.,"Sun into the person and deity of Apollo: and on the whole, we are"
9785,SECT. III.,left to infer that beginnings of that process may have been already
9786,SECT. III.,"visible. Homer, perhaps, did not care to advance it. At least, it"
9787,SECT. III.,does not appear to me that either he or his nation were friendly to
9788,SECT. III.,the conception of mere elemental gods. Gods who preside over external
9789,SECT. III.,"nature he presents to us in abundance; but gods, who are the mere"
9790,SECT. III.,"organs of external nature, are alien to the Greek genius as candidates"
9791,SECT. III.,"for the higher posts, and are relegated to subordinate places in the"
9792,SECT. III.,system. Only Vulcan and Ceres really appear with him to bear decisively
9793,SECT. III.,the stamp of this character: and both of them seem as if they were
9794,SECT. III.,"already in part detached from it, and developing in another direction."
9795,SECT. III.,For in Vulcan the human faculty of skill already predominates over
9796,SECT. III.,"fire, and Ceres impersonates the vegetable product of Earth, and not"
9797,SECT. III.,the mere dead mass.

9808,SECT. III.,Apollo. The lesson taught by both is the repugnance of the Greeks to
9809,SECT. III.,"mere Nature-worship. The signification of the second, in particular,"
9810,SECT. III.,"appears to be this, that as Ἠέλιος could not stand alone, and needed to"
9811,SECT. III.,"be absorbed, so he could find no place for his absorption so fitting"
9812,SECT. III.,"as in that deity, of whom, as well as of the more venerable traditions"

9835,SECT. III.,
9836,SECT. III.,The eastern origin of this god seems in an unusual degree to have been
9837,SECT. III.,remembered in the later popular tradition: and from the slight Homeric
9838,SECT. III.,notices we may find confirmation for the common idea; inasmuch as the
9839,SECT. III.,"poems appear both to mark him as not originally Greek nor Pelasgian,"
9840,SECT. III.,and likewise rather faintly to connect him with the Phœnicians.
9841,SECT. III.,
9842,SECT. III.,"His father was Jupiter, and his mother Semele. Her name occurs in a"
9843,SECT. III.,"Catalogue, of which the first part is composed of women, the second"

9845,SECT. III.,"mentioned may be rendered, ‘nor when (I was enamoured) of Semele, nor"
9846,SECT. III.,"(when) of Alcmene, in Thebes; and Alcmene had stout-hearted Hercules"
9847,SECT. III.,"for her son, but Semele bore Dionysus, joy of men.’ These words appear"
9848,SECT. III.,"probably to mean that Semele, as well as Alcmene, was in Thebes: and"
9849,SECT. III.,"this supports the post-Homeric, but ancient, tradition of the hymn to"
9850,SECT. III.,"Bacchus[505], which makes Semele the daughter of Cadmus. Now, Cadmus,"
9851,SECT. III.,"according to every reasonable presumption, was Phœnician. We have thus"
9852,SECT. III.,"a fixed chronological epoch, to which the god was junior. That is, we"

9861,SECT. III.,"by Diana in the island of Dia, on her way from Crete to Athens, at"
9862,SECT. III.,"the instance of Dionysus, Διονύσου μαρτυρίῃσιν. The most probable"

9865,SECT. III.,"Paris[507], on his way from Sparta, landed in Cranae with Helen: but"

9887,SECT. III.,"that this urn was reported by Thetis to be the work of Vulcan, and also"
9888,SECT. III.,to be the gift of Dionysus[509]. Her possession of a gift from him is
9889,SECT. III.,"in harmony with Il. v. 136, which represents her as having sheltered"
9890,SECT. III.,"him, when, through fear, he plunged into the sea: while his possession"
9891,SECT. III.,of a work of art in metal is best explained by the supposition that
9892,SECT. III.,"Homer regarded him as a Phœnician deity, since it was from that race"

9901,SECT. III.,"Odyssey afforded a series of occasions, upon any of which the mention"
9902,SECT. III.,of his name would have been highly suitable. We may perhaps even say
9903,SECT. III.,"that it could hardly have been omitted, if his worship had been general"

9906,SECT. III.,
9907,SECT. III.,The remaining Homeric notice of this deity which is also the most
9908,SECT. III.,"curious, sustains what has already been advanced. The Arcadian king,"
9909,SECT. III.,"Lycoorgus, scourged, and pursued over the hill Nyseion, the μαινομένοιο"
9910,SECT. III.,"Διωνύσοιο τιθήνας, the nurses of the frantic Bacchus; they in dismay"
9911,SECT. III.,"cast down their vine branches (θυσθλὰ), while he plunged into the"
9912,SECT. III.,"sea, and Thetis gave him refuge[510]. Jupiter, in retribution, struck"
9913,SECT. III.,"Lycoorgus blind, and cut short his days. Whatever explanation may be"
9914,SECT. III.,"adopted of its details, this legend seems to signify, beyond all doubt,"
9915,SECT. III.,that some forty or fifty years before the _Troica_ (for Lycoorgus was
9916,SECT. III.,"contemporary with the youth of Nestor[511]), the introduction of the"
9917,SECT. III.,"drunken worship of Bacchus was resisted by the Pelasgians of Arcadia,"
9918,SECT. III.,"and was for a time, at least, expelled by them. The mention of Dionysus"
9919,SECT. III.,as a child probably imports a further reference to the recency of his
9920,SECT. III.,worship: and there is something remarkable and significant in this
9921,SECT. III.,apparent commencement of violent opposition to it at the point when

9941,SECT. III.,by the deification of Semele after death. But perhaps another mode of
9942,SECT. III.,statement may be adopted. As it is evident that the original tradition
9943,SECT. III.,"made him the son of a woman, and as all those with whom he is classed"
9944,SECT. III.,"in Homer are probably historical personages, it seems possible that"
9945,SECT. III.,"he may have been one of our own race, whose discovery or extension"

9961,SECT. III.,"Though I state this as an historical possibility, I think it is certain"
9962,SECT. III.,"that, according to the Poet, Dionysus was from his birth one of the"
9963,SECT. III.,"Immortals: but it is also very doubtful whether he was one, to whom a"
9964,SECT. III.,"place belonged in the smaller Olympian Assembly. Even in later times,"
9965,SECT. III.,he was not one of the _Dii Majores_: and his being the son of a mortal
9966,SECT. III.,in Homer would tend to make it probable that he was not invested by the
9967,SECT. III.,"Poet with Olympian dignity. Again, he is only four times mentioned in"
9968,SECT. III.,"the whole of the poems; nor is a single act of his manhood recorded,"
9969,SECT. III.,except his information against Ariadne. That information seems to
9970,SECT. III.,"imply, that a known Greek island was sacred to him; and it was followed"
9971,SECT. III.,by the death of Ariadne under the darts of Diana. These circumstances
9972,SECT. III.,"may perhaps raise a presumption of his Olympian rank, equal to the"
9973,SECT. III.,adverse one which has been stated above. So far as this inquiry is
9974,SECT. III.,"concerned, the question must remain unsolved. But little of interest"
9975,SECT. III.,"can attach to these, the shameful parts of the Greek mythology, which"
9976,SECT. III.,"boast, as if it were our strength, of what can scarcely be excused as"
9977,SECT. III.,"our weakness, and which treat our shame as our joy. The real point of"
9978,SECT. III.,"interest is to learn whether there was a time when man, even though he"
9979,SECT. III.,"had lost the clear view of the guiding hand from above, yet revolted"
9980,SECT. III.,"against, or had not become familiar with, the deification of vicious"
9981,SECT. III.,passion. And we seem to find the note of such a time in Homer. Only one
9982,SECT. III.,laudatory phrase is applied throughout the poems to Dionysus; it is the
9983,SECT. III.,"χάρμα βροτοῖσιν, and these words are not the sentiment of the Poet, or"
9984,SECT. III.,of any character that represents his mind; they are put into the mouth
9985,SECT. III.,"of Jupiter, when he is speaking under a paroxysm of sensual passion."
9986,SECT. III.,
9987,SECT. III.,I have not adverted to the tradition which places the Lycoorgus of

10011,SECT. IV.,"But we must also consider those who do not appear in Olympus, and why"
10012,SECT. IV.,"they are excluded. If, as is perhaps the case, Aidoneus and Persephone"
10013,SECT. IV.,"are not there, it is because of the separateness of their work, and the"
10014,SECT. IV.,"remoteness of their kingdom. They had servants, guards, and a judge, in"
10015,SECT. IV.,"short, a sort of polity of their own. Atlas, Proteus, Calypso, Circe,"
10016,SECT. IV.,"and the other purely local deities, so far as we know, are not there;"
10017,SECT. IV.,"probably because they do not enter into the national religion, but"
10018,SECT. IV.,are little more than convenient symbols[515] of geographical points
10019,SECT. IV.,"known or conceived through maritime, that is, without doubt, through"
10020,SECT. IV.,"Phœnician report. Again, we do not hear in Olympus of Destiny, Sleep,"
10021,SECT. IV.,"Night, Dream, Terror, Panic, Uproar, and the rest; probably because"
10022,SECT. IV.,these had not attained to practical impersonation in the religion
10023,SECT. IV.,"of the people, but were merely objects of the poetical faculty. So"
10024,SECT. IV.,"likewise with respect to the Winds, who stand as receivers of worship"
10025,SECT. IV.,and sacrifice in Il. xxiii. 195. The different treatment which they
10026,SECT. IV.,"receive in the Iliad and Odyssey, like their non-appearance in the"
10027,SECT. IV.,"Great Chapter[516] of Olympus, unless referable to the peculiarities"
10028,SECT. IV.,"of the Outer Geography, shows that they had not a developed and"
10029,SECT. IV.,"established godhead, but might be dealt with by the Poet at his will."
10030,SECT. IV.,"In these imperfect impersonations, it has been well observed, sometimes"
10031,SECT. IV.,"the mere elemental power, sometimes the superinduced personality"
10032,SECT. IV.,"prevails. Again, Ἄτη the temptress, and Ἐρινύες the avengers, might"
10033,SECT. IV.,"stand excluded, both on the same ground of inadequate impersonation,"
10034,SECT. IV.,and on other grounds. Nereus and the purely elemental deities of the
10035,SECT. IV.,"sea are not summoned to the Assembly, apparently because he too had"
10036,SECT. IV.,his own submarine palace. It answered to Olympus; and here he sat in
10037,SECT. IV.,state amidst his numerous Court of Nymphs. Even Thetis was fetched from
10038,SECT. IV.,thence to attend the last Assembly of the gods in the Twenty-Fourth
10039,SECT. IV.,"Iliad. Κρόνος and Ῥέα are not in the divine meetings, firstly, because"
10040,SECT. IV.,"he, probably with her as his reflected image, is penally confined in"
10041,SECT. IV.,"Tartarus; but secondly, because, the first representing Time, and"
10042,SECT. IV.,"the second Matter, they are the primary ideas in the metaphysical"
10043,SECT. IV.,"order, which comprehended all others, and from which all others were"
10044,SECT. IV.,"derivative. And as they stood in the metaphysical _nexus_ of ideas, so"
10045,SECT. IV.,"stood Oceanus and his feminine, Tethys, in the terrestrial order; where"
10046,SECT. IV.,"Oceanus was the all-inclosing, all-containing; the Form, within which"
10047,SECT. IV.,"every terrestrial existence was cast, and beyond which even Thought"
10048,SECT. IV.,could not pass. Hence the curious and marked exception of him from the
10049,SECT. IV.,summons of Themis to the Great Assembly of the Twentieth Book[517].

10065,SECT. IV.,perhaps because Homer meant to assign to Oceanus and Tethys the actual
10066,SECT. IV.,first parentage of the gods. This supposition is favoured by the fact
10067,SECT. IV.,"that Juno applies the name μήτηρ[518] to Tethys, in a connection which"

10086,SECT. IV.,"world between the Kronid brothers. This shows us afresh, that he is"
10087,SECT. IV.,outside and independent of their rule: he forms the framework of the
10088,SECT. IV.,"visible creation, while they are parts of the picture that is within"
10089,SECT. IV.,the framework.
10090,SECT. IV.,
10091,SECT. IV.,The same thing is true of Κρόνος and Ῥέα in the metaphysical order.
10092,SECT. IV.,They represent anterior conditions of thought and of existence to all

10094,SECT. IV.,"it is, even more than that of Oceanus, in abeyance: for Oceanus is at"
10095,SECT. IV.,"least ever-flowing, while Time, and Space, or Matter, are with Homer"
10096,SECT. IV.,"wholly passionless, mute, and still. When once the Kronid family has"
10097,SECT. IV.,"been brought into existence, and the attempt of Time to impose the law"
10098,SECT. IV.,"of death on Deity has been put down by Jupiter, then the impersonations"
10099,SECT. IV.,"are virtually withdrawn from him and his partner, and they relapse into"
10100,SECT. IV.,the torpid state of purely abstract ideas.
10101,SECT. IV.,
10102,SECT. IV.,The Elemental Powers have nowhere what may be called a strong position
10103,SECT. IV.,"in Homer, except in the invocations of solemn swearing; where they give"
10104,SECT. IV.,"force to the Oath, because they are the avengers of perjury. Thus their"
10105,SECT. IV.,"connection is not with deity in general, but with that nether world,"
10106,SECT. IV.,which the ideas of mankind have always associated with the lower parts
10107,SECT. IV.,of the Earth[521].

10110,SECT. IV.,
10111,SECT. IV.,"Even on grounds larger than those derived from a particular phrase,"
10112,SECT. IV.,"it may be probable, that we ought to consider Oceanus as the Homeric"
10113,SECT. IV.,"parent of all the deities, Κρόνος and Ῥέα included. To a state of"
10114,SECT. IV.,"the human mind not yet familiar with abstractions, Time and Place,"
10115,SECT. IV.,"imperfectly conceived, might be more limited, less comprehensive, than"
10116,SECT. IV.,"the great all-infolding Ocean, which encircled and wrapped in the"
10117,SECT. IV.,world. And in this conception there may lie hid the embryo of what
10118,SECT. IV.,"afterwards grew into the aquarian cosmogony, a system which appears not"
10119,SECT. IV.,"to be without support from other passages of the poem, especially from"
10120,SECT. IV.,"the very curious verse (Il. vii. 99),"

10129,SECT. IV.,
10130,SECT. IV.,The Olympian deities of Pagan antiquity are commonly represented as
10131,SECT. IV.,twelve in number; and the names are
10132,SECT. IV.,
10133,SECT. IV.,1. Jupiter.
10134,SECT. IV.,2. Juno.

10144,SECT. IV.,12. Ceres.
10145,SECT. IV.,
10146,SECT. IV.,But Homer knows nothing of this number or arrangement of the gods;
10147,SECT. IV.,or of the distinction between _Dii majores_ and _Dii minores_. Nor
10148,SECT. IV.,does he enable us with precision to substitute any other number for
10149,SECT. IV.,"it. He gives us, however, his idea, at least by approximation, of the"
10150,SECT. IV.,"number of the Olympian gods. For when Thetis visits Vulcan, to obtain"
10151,SECT. IV.,"new armour for Achilles, she finds the deity at work upon twenty"
10152,SECT. IV.,"τρίποδες[522], to stand round the wall of the well-built hall, which he"
10153,SECT. IV.,"is carefully fitting with wheels, in order that they may automatically"
10154,SECT. IV.,take their places in the assembly of the gods. Whatever these τρίποδες
10155,SECT. IV.,"be, the number is probably meant to correspond with that of the"
10156,SECT. IV.,ordinary Olympian meeting for festivity or deliberation. They are
10157,SECT. IV.,commonly supposed to be bowls or vessels for wine set on three-legged
10158,SECT. IV.,"stands; but there are two reasons, suggested by the language of the"
10159,SECT. IV.,"passage, which seem to recommend our understanding the word to mean"
10160,SECT. IV.,"seats, such as that of the priestess of Apollo at Delphi: one is,"
10161,SECT. IV.,"their being intended to stand around the apartment, along the wall:"
10162,SECT. IV.,"and the other is, that they were to place themselves for the divine"
10163,SECT. IV.,assembly[523];

10171,SECT. IV.,
10172,SECT. IV.,"This idea of the great bowls placing themselves, one apparently for"
10173,SECT. IV.,"each deity to draw from, does not correspond with the classical"
10174,SECT. IV.,"representation of the cupbearer filling the cup of each, as he moves"
10175,SECT. IV.,from the left towards the right. Nor does the word ἄγων seem to be
10176,SECT. IV.,"suitable for a merely convivial meeting: and we ought, I presume, to"
10177,SECT. IV.,consider the meetings on Olympus as in theory political councils for
10178,SECT. IV.,"the government of the world, only relieved by meat and drink. If we"
10179,SECT. IV.,"take τρίποδες as signifying the seats, it has of course a reference"
10180,SECT. IV.,to the number of gods who constituted the ordinary Olympian family;
10181,SECT. IV.,"a reference which indeed it may probably have, even if the other"
10182,SECT. IV.,signification be preferred.
10183,SECT. IV.,
10184,SECT. IV.,"And the text of the poems affords sufficient evidence, that twenty was"
10185,SECT. IV.,about the number of the Olympian gods of Jupiter.

10187,SECT. IV.,~_Deities of Olympian rank in Homer._~
10188,SECT. IV.,
10189,SECT. IV.,"Of the Olympian twelve recognised in later times, all, except Vesta"
10190,SECT. IV.,"and Ceres, must at once and indubitably be pronounced Olympian in"
10191,SECT. IV.,"Homer. For all take part in the Trojan war, and likewise make their"
10192,SECT. IV.,appearance in Olympus. Thus we have ten Olympian deities of Homer
10193,SECT. IV.,already ascertained. And there are several others whom we can have no
10194,SECT. IV.,doubt in adding to the list. These we will proceed to consider:
10195,SECT. IV.,
10196,SECT. IV.,1. Latona is clearly Olympian; from her great dignity as an
10197,SECT. IV.,"unquestioned wife of Jupiter (ἄλοχος Διὸς, Il. xxi. 499); and from the"
10198,SECT. IV.,"fact that her position entitled her to take a side in the Trojan war,"
10199,SECT. IV.,"where none but Olympian deities were engaged, with the single exception"
10200,SECT. IV.,"of the formidable local power, Xanthus or Scamander. Another reason is,"
10201,SECT. IV.,"because the title of Dione, as we shall see, is clear; who is a deity"
10202,SECT. IV.,"in some respects similar, but decidedly inferior, to Latona."
10203,SECT. IV.,
10204,SECT. IV.,2. Dione the mother of Venus is in the same order. For she receives
10205,SECT. IV.,"her child, when she repairs wounded to Olympus, and in her speech of"
10206,SECT. IV.,consolation distinctly describes herself as one of the Ὀλύμπια δώματ’
10207,SECT. IV.,"ἔχοντες, Il. v. 383. She is called in this passage δῖα θεάων: a title"
10208,SECT. IV.,"twice given to Minerva, but also, sometimes, to very secondary deities,"
10209,SECT. IV.,"such as Calypso and Circe. Either as insignificant, or possibly as"
10210,SECT. IV.,"being foreign and not sufficiently naturalized, she finds no place in"
10211,SECT. IV.,the Catalogue of Mothers in the Fourteenth Iliad.
10212,SECT. IV.,
10213,SECT. IV.,"3. Iris, the messenger-goddess. The grounds of her title may be found"
10214,SECT. IV.,among the remarks upon this deity[524].
10215,SECT. IV.,
10216,SECT. IV.,[524] See sup. p. 156.
10217,SECT. IV.,
10218,SECT. IV.,"4. Themis, although not a party in the war, has the office of"
10219,SECT. IV.,Pursuivant or Summoner to the Olympian Assembly: and her ordinary
10220,SECT. IV.,"presence there is distinctly proved by the Fifteenth Iliad, where she"
10221,SECT. IV.,is the first to welcome Juno on her entrance into the circle.
10222,SECT. IV.,
10223,SECT. IV.,5. It will be seen from a brief statement elsewhere relating to
10224,SECT. IV.,"Aidoneus or Aides, that he is clearly of Olympian rank and character."
10225,SECT. IV.,
10226,SECT. IV.,"6. Next to Aidoneus, we may take the claim of Hebe. She is not indeed"
10227,SECT. IV.,"an important, nor a very prominent, person in the poems: but there is"
10228,SECT. IV.,no room for doubt as to her Olympian dignity. We find her officiating
10229,SECT. IV.,as cupbearer in the Olympian Court of the Fourth Iliad. Her connection
10230,SECT. IV.,with Olympus is further established by her assisting Juno in the
10231,SECT. IV.,"preparation of her chariot: and by her assisting Mars in the bath,"
10232,SECT. IV.,"when that deity has betaken himself into the presence of Jupiter, to"
10233,SECT. IV.,"complain of his wound. Again, her personality is quite clear. Nor can"
10234,SECT. IV.,her divinity be questioned. She is pronounced in the Eleventh Odyssey
10235,SECT. IV.,to be the daughter of Jupiter and Here. The verse is suspected; but
10236,SECT. IV.,"the suspicion itself may be suspected in its turn. Further, the case"
10237,SECT. IV.,"rests not on the particular account given of her parentage, but, in"
10238,SECT. IV.,"connection with the context, on her appearing as the wife of Hercules"
10239,SECT. IV.,at all. Nor is she anywhere connected with the idea of a mortal
10240,SECT. IV.,origin[525].
10241,SECT. IV.,
10242,SECT. IV.,"[525] Il. iv. 2. v. 721, 905. Od. xi. 603."
10243,SECT. IV.,
10244,SECT. IV.,7. A second divinity of somewhat similar rank is Paieon. On two
10245,SECT. IV.,"occasions, he heals in Olympus the wounds of deities; first of"
10246,SECT. IV.,"Aidoneus, then of Mars. He is summoned to the exercise of his function"
10247,SECT. IV.,"as a person within call, and habitually present there. After the rebuke"
10248,SECT. IV.,"of Jupiter to Mars, the line that follows is[526],"

10253,SECT. IV.,
10254,SECT. IV.,"There is no doubt therefore either of his personal, or of his Olympian"
10255,SECT. IV.,character; and none but divine persons are capable of bearing the
10256,SECT. IV.,"Olympian offices. Ganymede, for instance, though carried up to dwell"
10257,SECT. IV.,"among the Immortals in order to pour out wine, has no function assigned"
10258,SECT. IV.,"to him in the poems. The Egyptians, indeed, are stated to be of the"
10259,SECT. IV.,race of Paieon[527]; but we must probably understand this with respect
10260,SECT. IV.,"to their royal family, just as the same thing is said of the Phæacians"
10261,SECT. IV.,"with respect to Neptune, because their kingly house had sprung from"
10262,SECT. IV.,"him[528]. In the later mythology he appears to be absorbed, like the"
10263,SECT. IV.,"Sun, in Apollo; but in the Homeric poems there is no confusion, or"
10264,SECT. IV.,"approach to confusion, of the persons. Paieon has the relation to"
10265,SECT. IV.,"Apollo with respect to surgery or medicine, which Vulcan has to Minerva"
10266,SECT. IV.,"with respect to manual art: and, apparently by a mixture of distinct"
10267,SECT. IV.,"traditions, he is also connected with Apollo, by being the synonyme for"
10268,SECT. IV.,"the hymn of victory, of which Apollo is doubtless supposed to be in a"
10269,SECT. IV.,peculiar manner the giver.

10275,SECT. IV.,To all these deities the poems appear to give a title to seats in
10276,SECT. IV.,"Olympus, unquestionable as well as direct. By a somewhat less clear and"
10277,SECT. IV.,"simple process, we may, I think, arrive at a similar conclusion as to"
10278,SECT. IV.,the views of Homer regarding two other deities.
10279,SECT. IV.,
10280,SECT. IV.,"8. The first of these is Demeter, or Ceres, whose Olympian rank is"
10281,SECT. IV.,"considered, and I think established, in the remarks elsewhere upon her"
10282,SECT. IV.,individual divinity[529].
10283,SECT. IV.,
10284,SECT. IV.,[529] See sup. sect. iii. p. 215.
10285,SECT. IV.,
10286,SECT. IV.,"9. The second is Ἠέλιος, the Sun. His share in the episode of Mars and"
10287,SECT. IV.,Venus[530] does not indeed absolutely imply his residing on Olympus.
10288,SECT. IV.,But this is clearly involved in the account of his receiving the
10289,SECT. IV.,"intelligence, that his oxen had been consumed by the companions of"
10290,SECT. IV.,"Ulysses. For, upon hearing it, he instantly proceeds to address the"
10291,SECT. IV.,"company of the Immortals assembled there[531], and is answered by"
10292,SECT. IV.,Jupiter. He must therefore unquestionably stand as one of the Olympian
10293,SECT. IV.,gods of Homer.

10298,SECT. IV.,
10299,SECT. IV.,"There are but three other personages named in Homer, with respect to"
10300,SECT. IV.,"whom there is room for the supposition, that he may have intended"
10301,SECT. IV.,"them to rank as Olympian deities. They are Dionysus, Persephone, and"
10302,SECT. IV.,"Eris. For Histie, or Vesta, is so entirely wanting in personality,"
10303,SECT. IV.,that she cannot possibly belong to that order. She is invoked indeed
10304,SECT. IV.,in company with Jupiter; but with these two is likewise combined the
10305,SECT. IV.,"ξενίη τράπεζα, the table of hospitality. In the hymn to Venus[532] she"
10306,SECT. IV.,"has become fully personified, and is celebrated as the eldest of the"
10307,SECT. IV.,daughters of Κρόνος. But this imagery probably belongs to a different
10308,SECT. IV.,stage of Greek society and Greek poetry.

10317,SECT. IV.,~_The Eris of Homer._~
10318,SECT. IV.,
10319,SECT. IV.,3. The case of Eris is different. She is the sister and also the
10320,SECT. IV.,"mistress of Mars[534]. And in the fierce battle of the Eleventh Book,"
10321,SECT. IV.,"Eris alone is present to enjoy it, while all the other deities,"
10322,SECT. IV.,"inhibited from action by Jupiter, have betaken themselves to their"
10323,SECT. IV.,several abodes on Olympus.
10324,SECT. IV.,
10325,SECT. IV.,[534] Il. iv. 440.
10326,SECT. IV.,
10327,SECT. IV.,"Again, Jupiter sends her down to the camp at the beginning of the"
10328,SECT. IV.,"Eleventh Iliad, where she stands on the ship of Ulysses, and raises a"
10329,SECT. IV.,"mighty shout to stir up the Greeks for the contest[535]. The word is,"
10330,SECT. IV.,"indeed, the common and established word for strife in Homer, and it is"
10331,SECT. IV.,"applied even to the conflict of the gods[536], θεῶν ἔριδι ξυνιόντων."
10332,SECT. IV.,But this use of it is probably to be compared with that of Ἄρης for a
10333,SECT. IV.,"spear, and of Ἀφροδίτη (in later Greek) for the sensual function of"
10334,SECT. IV.,"that deity. She is, on the whole, less a figure than a person, though"
10335,SECT. IV.,"standing upon the border between the two respectively; and though, as"
10336,SECT. IV.,"she never actually performs what may be called a personal action, she"
10337,SECT. IV.,"is only by a few degrees removed from the family of Terror, Din, Panic,"
10338,SECT. IV.,"and the rest. The first of these, Φόβος, as he is the son of Mars[537],"
10339,SECT. IV.,"and attends him in fight against the Ephyri, is as distinctly"
10340,SECT. IV.,personified as Eris in one passage; but the effect of it is neutralized
10341,SECT. IV.,"by others, where he passes into sheer figure. She rejoices in seeing"
10342,SECT. IV.,the slaughter[538] wrought in battle: and an intense eagerness is
10343,SECT. IV.,"imputed to her[539], of course meaning an eagerness for blood."

10354,SECT. IV.,
10355,SECT. IV.,But another form of this deity is probably exhibited to us under
10356,SECT. IV.,"another name, that of the πτολίπορθος Ἐνύω. Enuo is mentioned together"
10357,SECT. IV.,"with Pallas as being a warlike deity, in contrast with the effeminate"
10358,SECT. IV.,Venus[540]: and she leads the Trojans to the fight in concert with
10359,SECT. IV.,"Mars: but while he has a huge spear in his hands, she holds or leads,"
10360,SECT. IV.,"instead, another form more shadowy than her own, that of Κύδοιμος or"
10361,SECT. IV.,Tumult. Yet the mode in which she is joined with Pallas proves her
10362,SECT. IV.,"impersonation. The fundamental identity of her name with Ἐνυάλιος, the"
10363,SECT. IV.,"second name of Mars, and her joining him in leading on the Trojans,"
10364,SECT. IV.,place her in some very close relation to him: and that close relation
10365,SECT. IV.,"cannot well be other than the twofold one of sister and mistress, which"
10366,SECT. IV.,had been assigned to Ἔρις.

10369,SECT. IV.,
10370,SECT. IV.,"When it is said, that ‘she alone of the gods was present, as the others"
10371,SECT. IV.,"had retired to their respective mansions on Olympus,’ the most natural"
10372,SECT. IV.,"inference certainly is, that she too is meant to be described as"
10373,SECT. IV.,belonging to the Olympian Court.
10374,SECT. IV.,
10375,SECT. IV.,"Upon the whole, it seems pretty clear, that if the Poet intended to"
10376,SECT. IV.,limit absolutely the number of the Olympian Court or Minor Assembly
10377,SECT. IV.,"to the exact figure twenty, then the choice for the twentieth place"
10378,SECT. IV.,"will more justly fall on his Eris, than either his Dionysus, or even"
10379,SECT. IV.,"his Persephone. It appears to me, however, that so strict a numerical"
10380,SECT. IV.,precision is not in the manner of Homer; that he intended the twenty
10381,SECT. IV.,"tripods to be a general indication of the number of the Court, and"
10382,SECT. IV.,"that with this indication the facts of the poems substantially, though"
10383,SECT. IV.,"indeterminately, agree."

10389,SECT. IV.,"The Deities who, in virtue of belonging to that Court, may be most"
10390,SECT. IV.,"properly called Olympian, may be divided into the following classes:"
10391,SECT. IV.,
10392,SECT. IV.,"I. Deities having their basis, and the general outline of their"

10420,SECT. IV.,10. Dione.
10421,SECT. IV.,11. Hebe.
10422,SECT. IV.,"12. Eris, or Enuo.*"
10423,SECT. IV.,13. Dionysus.*
10424,SECT. IV.,
10425,SECT. IV.,"Those three names, which are marked with an asterisk, appear to have"
10426,SECT. IV.,only a more or less disputable title to a seat in Olympus.
10427,SECT. IV.,
10428,SECT. IV.,"Outside, so to speak, of Olympus and its Court, we may classify the"
10429,SECT. IV.,"superhuman intelligences of Homer as follows: observing, however,"
10430,SECT. IV.,"that the minor deities who represent natural powers, if thoroughly"
10431,SECT. IV.,"personified, give their attendance in Olympus on high occasions, and"
10432,SECT. IV.,help to form its great Chapter or Parliament.
10433,SECT. IV.,
10434,SECT. IV.,They may be thrown into the six following classes:
10435,SECT. IV.,
10436,SECT. IV.,"1. The greater impersonations of natural powers, and of ideas; with"
10437,SECT. IV.,"their reflections, where such have been formed, in the feminine. These"
10438,SECT. IV.,are
10439,SECT. IV.,
10440,SECT. IV.,Oceanus and Tethys.
10441,SECT. IV.,
10442,SECT. IV.,Κρόνος and Ῥέα.
10443,SECT. IV.,
10444,SECT. IV.,"Ouranos and Gaia (not Earth, but rather Land)."
10445,SECT. IV.,
10446,SECT. IV.,Nereus and Amphitrite.
10447,SECT. IV.,
10448,SECT. IV.,We are not authorized by Homer to associate either of these last
10449,SECT. IV.,couples as husband and wife. We have to add:
10450,SECT. IV.,
10451,SECT. IV.,"Destiny, (which also has a place in the fifth class,) Dream, Sleep,"
10452,SECT. IV.,"Death, Terror, Panic, Rumour, Din, Uproar."
10453,SECT. IV.,
10454,SECT. IV.,"The process of impersonation is with some of these fully developed,"
10455,SECT. IV.,"with others scarcely begun, and wholly poetical; therefore as yet in"
10456,SECT. IV.,"no degree mythological. In one place, Il. xiii. 299, Φόβος is the son"
10457,SECT. IV.,"of Mars, in another Φόβος and Δεῖμος are his horses (xiii. 119.); and"
10458,SECT. IV.,"in a third they appear along with Ἔρις, in a shape hovering between"
10459,SECT. IV.,"personality and allegory. Ἔρις herself, at times fully personified,"
10460,SECT. IV.,"in one passage is simply a figure on the Ægis of Minerva, perhaps,"
10461,SECT. IV.,"however, as an animated work of art, Il. v. 740. In all these cases we"
10462,SECT. IV.,see the work of poetical fabrication actually going on.
10463,SECT. IV.,
10464,SECT. IV.,"Perhaps the best example of a merely poetical, as distinguished from a"
10465,SECT. IV.,"religious or practical impersonation, is to be found in Æschylus, who"
10466,SECT. IV.,makes Dust the brother of Mud[541].
10467,SECT. IV.,
10468,SECT. IV.,[541] Æsch. Ag. 480.
10469,SECT. IV.,
10470,SECT. IV.,"This class was greatly augmented in the later Theogonies, beginning"
10471,SECT. IV.,with Hesiod.
10472,SECT. IV.,
10473,SECT. IV.,"2. The minor impersonations of natural powers, such as"
10474,SECT. IV.,
10475,SECT. IV.,(1) The Winds.
10476,SECT. IV.,(2) The Rivers.
10477,SECT. IV.,(3) The Nymphs of meadows.
10478,SECT. IV.,(4) The Nymphs of fountains.
10479,SECT. IV.,(5) The Nymphs of groves.
10480,SECT. IV.,(6) The Nymphs of hills.
10481,SECT. IV.,(7) The Sea Nymphs.
10482,SECT. IV.,
10483,SECT. IV.,"3. I place in a different class all those deities, who appear in Homer"
10484,SECT. IV.,as the subjects of foreign fable not fully naturalized. These are
10485,SECT. IV.,they who dwell in the Outer sphere of the marvellous Geography in the
10486,SECT. IV.,"Odyssey, and with whom Menelaus and Ulysses are brought into contact."
10487,SECT. IV.,"They are wholly exterior to the system of Homer, and we cannot safely"
10488,SECT. IV.,give them a position implying any defined relation to it. But there
10489,SECT. IV.,"are certain links supplied by the Poet himself, as when he makes Circe"
10490,SECT. IV.,"child of the Sun, and Mercury presumptively nephew of Calypso: by these"
10491,SECT. IV.,"he shows us the connection of the Greek mythology with Eastern sources,"
10492,SECT. IV.,and the partial assimilation of the materials they supplied.
10493,SECT. IV.,
10494,SECT. IV.,These deities are:
10495,SECT. IV.,
10496,SECT. IV.,1. Proteus.
10497,SECT. IV.,2. Leucothee.
10498,SECT. IV.,3. Æolus (perhaps).
10499,SECT. IV.,4. The Sirens.
10500,SECT. IV.,5. Calypso.
10501,SECT. IV.,6. Atlas.
10502,SECT. IV.,7. Circe.
10503,SECT. IV.,8. Œetes.
10504,SECT. IV.,9. Maias.
10505,SECT. IV.,10. Perse.
10506,SECT. IV.,11. Eidothee.
10507,SECT. IV.,And several Nymphs[542].
10508,SECT. IV.,
10509,SECT. IV.,"[542] Od. i. 71. xii. 132, 3."
10510,SECT. IV.,
10511,SECT. IV.,"4. Those impersonations which represent, each in its several part,"
10512,SECT. IV.,"or its peculiar aspect, the tradition of the Evil One, have been"
10513,SECT. IV.,considered along with the deities of tradition.
10514,SECT. IV.,
10515,SECT. IV.,"5. Of ministers of doom or justice, real or reputed, and less than"
10516,SECT. IV.,"divine, yet belonging to the metaphysical or moral order, we have in"
10517,SECT. IV.,Homer:
10518,SECT. IV.,
10519,SECT. IV.,"1. The Fates, Κῆρες, who fall within the range of ideas described by"
10520,SECT. IV.,his Αἶσα and his Μοῖρα.
10521,SECT. IV.,
10522,SECT. IV.,2. The Ἁρπυῖαι.
10523,SECT. IV.,
10524,SECT. IV.,3. The Ἐρινύες.
10525,SECT. IV.,
10526,SECT. IV.,"6. Besides all these, we have yet another class with subdivisions of"
10527,SECT. IV.,"its own, composed of beings who stand within the interval between Deity"
10528,SECT. IV.,and Humanity.
10529,SECT. IV.,
10530,SECT. IV.,There are some observations to be made on several of these classes.
10531,SECT. IV.,
10532,SECT. IV.,~_Destiny or Fate in Homer._~
10533,SECT. IV.,
10534,SECT. IV.,It is much easier to obtain a just perception of the manner in which
10535,SECT. IV.,"Homer handles the subject of Destiny or Fate, than to represent it in a"
10536,SECT. IV.,"system. The conflict which it involves, either of ideas, or at least of"
10537,SECT. IV.,"the words denoting them, was certain to give occasion to argument and"
10538,SECT. IV.,difference of opinion in a case where a poet is of necessity called to
10539,SECT. IV.,take his trial at the bar of philosophy[543].
10540,SECT. IV.,
10541,SECT. IV.,"[543] The subject has been treated with great ability by Nägelsbach,"
10542,SECT. IV.,"Hom. Theol., Abschnitt iii."
10543,SECT. IV.,
10544,SECT. IV.,"Besides the θέσφατον, on which I shall make a remark hereafter, there"
10545,SECT. IV.,are five forms of speech which are employed by Homer to express the
10546,SECT. IV.,"idea of Destiny; they are, Κατακλῶθες, Κήρ, Μοῖρα, Μόρος, and Αἶσα:"
10547,SECT. IV.,"the two last in the singular number only, the two preceding it in the"
10548,SECT. IV.,"singular or plural, and the Κατακλῶθες only in the plural."
10549,SECT. IV.,
10550,SECT. IV.,"Of these, the Κῆρες and the Κατακλῶθες have undergone the most"
10551,SECT. IV.,"effective process of personification; but, brought more distinctly into"
10552,SECT. IV.,"the sphere of life and action, these phrases have a much less profound"
10553,SECT. IV.,"root in the order of ideas, and scarcely touch the great questions,"
10554,SECT. IV.,"whether destiny is a power separate from the human will, separate from"
10555,SECT. IV.,"the Divine will, and superior to either or to both."
10556,SECT. IV.,
10557,SECT. IV.,"The fundamental idea both of Μοῖρα and Αἶσα, traced from their original"
10558,SECT. IV.,"source, is not a part merely, but rather a portion or share allotted"
10559,SECT. IV.,"according to some rule or law. But, though of similar origin, some"
10560,SECT. IV.,distinctions obtain between the uses of the two words. And first as to
10561,SECT. IV.,Αἶσα.
10562,SECT. IV.,
10563,SECT. IV.,~_Under the form of Αἶσα._~
10564,SECT. IV.,
10565,SECT. IV.,"We have in Il. xviii. 327, ληΐδος αἶσα; in Od. xix. 24, ἐλπίδος αἶσα;"
10566,SECT. IV.,"in Il. ix. 378, τίω δέ μιν ἐν καρὸς αἴσῃ. In all these cases it is"
10567,SECT. IV.,"plain, that the word means not a mere part, but a part assigned upon"
10568,SECT. IV.,some given principle. Hence it comes to mean either the whole share or
10569,SECT. IV.,"lot assigned to a man, or the law according to which it is assigned,"
10570,SECT. IV.,"that is, the law under which the moral government of human life, and"
10571,SECT. IV.,"the distribution of good and evil, are conducted. Accordingly, we have"
10572,SECT. IV.,these several senses in which it is employed.
10573,SECT. IV.,
10574,SECT. IV.,"1. The αἶσα, as the entire destiny, of an individual man, Il. i. 416."
10575,SECT. IV.,"Ἐπεί νύ τοι αἶσα μίνυνθά περ, οὔτι μάλα δήν."
10576,SECT. IV.,
10577,SECT. IV.,"2. A notable part of that destiny, as his death: Τῷ οἱ ἀπεμνήσαντο καὶ"
10578,SECT. IV.,ἐν θανάτοιό περ αἴσῃ. Il. xxiv. 428.
10579,SECT. IV.,
10580,SECT. IV.,"3. The moral law for the government of conduct, as in Ἕκτορ, ἐπεί με"
10581,SECT. IV.,"κατ’ αἶσαν ἐνίπαπες, οὐδ’ ὑπὲρ αἶσαν. Il. iii. 59."
10582,SECT. IV.,
10583,SECT. IV.,4. That moral law as it is supposed to proceed from Jupiter; the Διὸς
10584,SECT. IV.,"αἶσα, or dispensation of Jupiter; the δαίμονος αἶσα, or dispensation of"
10585,SECT. IV.,Providence.
10586,SECT. IV.,
10587,SECT. IV.,"5. That same law, as it is supposed to proceed from some other source,"
10588,SECT. IV.,"or to speak more correctly, for Homer, as the power which administers"
10589,SECT. IV.,it is separately personified. This we have in the passage ἅσσα οἱ Αἶσα
10590,SECT. IV.,"γεινομένῳ ἐπένησε λίνῳ, ὅτε μιν τέκε Μήτηρ, Il. xx. 127; or, again, as"
10591,SECT. IV.,in Od. vii. 197; where Αἶσα is assisted in the spinning process by the
10592,SECT. IV.,"Κατακλῶθες βαρεῖαι, as if it was felt that she was not strong enough to"
10593,SECT. IV.,make a Destiny.
10594,SECT. IV.,
10595,SECT. IV.,Upon the whole it appears to me that there is in the word Αἶσα only the
10596,SECT. IV.,minutest savour of the proper idea of Fate. For Fate involves these
10597,SECT. IV.,things: 1. a power dominant over man: 2. a power independent of the
10598,SECT. IV.,divinity: and 3. a power standing ideally apart from right.
10599,SECT. IV.,
10600,SECT. IV.,"Now αἶσα does not fully answer even to the first of these conceptions,"
10601,SECT. IV.,"since αἶσα, even when it is backed by the gods, may be overcome by the"
10602,SECT. IV.,energies of man. Jupiter in the Iliad[544] ordained glory to Hector and
10603,SECT. IV.,success to the Trojans until the sunset of the day when the battle of
10604,SECT. IV.,the ships was fought: yet just before the death of Patroclus the Greeks
10605,SECT. IV.,"prevailed, Il. xvi. 780."
10606,SECT. IV.,
10607,SECT. IV.,[544] Il. xi. 192-4 and xviii. 455.
10608,SECT. IV.,
10609,SECT. IV.,καὶ τότε δή ῥ’ ὑπὲρ αἶσαν Ἀχαιοὶ φέρτεροι ἦσαν.
10610,SECT. IV.,
10611,SECT. IV.,The only instances in which we find αἶσα endowed with any thing in the
10612,SECT. IV.,nature of an inexorable force are such as that quoted from Il. xx.
10613,SECT. IV.,"127. In this passage it is said by Juno, ‘We will give Achilles glory;"
10614,SECT. IV.,thereafter let him suffer what αἶσα has appointed for him.’ Now this
10615,SECT. IV.,"refers not to a course of life that he was to pass through, but simply"
10616,SECT. IV.,"to the crisis of his death. In Od. vii, the speaker is Alcinous; and"
10617,SECT. IV.,"his sentiment is, ‘Let us carry our guest safe home and then leave him"
10618,SECT. IV.,to whatever αἶσα and the κατακλῶθες have ordained for him.’ Probably
10619,SECT. IV.,"this is only an euphemism, and means death, as Juno meant it; but,"
10620,SECT. IV.,"in any case, proceeding from another mortal, it is a mere form of"
10621,SECT. IV.,speech perfectly compatible in itself with the idea that the gods are
10622,SECT. IV.,"superior to αἶσα, nay, that man may upon occasion surmount it. In the"
10623,SECT. IV.,other case it is not so; we must understand Juno to recognise the
10624,SECT. IV.,αἶσα or dispensation as absolute; but then it is the dispensation of
10625,SECT. IV.,"death; and it is, I think, the clear doctrine of the poems that that"
10626,SECT. IV.,"dispensation cannot be cancelled or averted from mortals, though there"
10627,SECT. IV.,"are various modes in which it may be escaped or baffled: one of them,"
10628,SECT. IV.,"that of postponement, which is temporary: another, that of translation"
10629,SECT. IV.,"out of the mortal state, as in the case of Ganymede: and a third, that"
10630,SECT. IV.,"of revival, as in the cases of Castor and Pollux. To Minerva alone is"
10631,SECT. IV.,ascribed a power over death: and this seems to be a power of subsequent
10632,SECT. IV.,"rescue, and not one of absolute exemption. Euryclea comforts Penelope"
10633,SECT. IV.,"with the exhortation to pray to Minerva about Ulysses[545], as she can"
10634,SECT. IV.,afterwards deliver him;
10635,SECT. IV.,
10636,SECT. IV.,[545] Od. iv. 753.
10637,SECT. IV.,
10638,SECT. IV.,ἡ γάρ κέν μιν ἔπειτα ἐκ θανάτοιο σαώσαι.
10639,SECT. IV.,
10640,SECT. IV.,The stress is evidently to be laid upon the word ἔπειτα.
10641,SECT. IV.,
10642,SECT. IV.,"Another passage, which may at first sight present a different"
10643,SECT. IV.,"appearance, will, I think, on examination, be found to harmonize"
10644,SECT. IV.,"completely with what has been said. When in the Sixteenth Iliad,"
10645,SECT. IV.,Jupiter perceives that his cherished son Sarpedon is about to meet his
10646,SECT. IV.,"death by encountering Patroclus, he laments that it should be the"
10647,SECT. IV.,"destiny of one to him the dearest of men, to be slain by that warrior."
10648,SECT. IV.,Then he proceeds to consider whether he shall remove him from the scene
10649,SECT. IV.,"of danger, though he was fated to die, or whether he shall subdue him"
10650,SECT. IV.,"by the hands of Patroclus[546],"
10651,SECT. IV.,
10652,SECT. IV.,[546] Il. xvi. 438.
10653,SECT. IV.,
10654,SECT. IV.,ἢ ἤδη ὑπὸ χερσὶ Μενοιτιάδαο δαμάσσω.
10655,SECT. IV.,
10656,SECT. IV.,"Thus, in the space of a few lines, 1. he seems to recognise destiny as"
10657,SECT. IV.,"a power superior to his own will; then, 2. he debates whether he shall"
10658,SECT. IV.,"overrule this superior power; and lastly, 3. he treats the execution"
10659,SECT. IV.,"of its decree as the act of that very will of his. And on this course,"
10660,SECT. IV.,"advised by Juno, he finally decides."
10661,SECT. IV.,
10662,SECT. IV.,"He desists from executing this plan, not because it is impossible, but"
10663,SECT. IV.,"apparently for two reasons: the first, that it may cause discontent and"
10664,SECT. IV.,"spleen among the gods; the second, that by similar interferences, on"
10665,SECT. IV.,"behalf each of his own child, they too may trouble the order of nature."
10666,SECT. IV.,"His power, therefore, to execute the scheme is clearly implied. But"
10667,SECT. IV.,"what scheme? Not one for repealing the law of death, so far as Sarpedon"
10668,SECT. IV.,is concerned[547]; but simply for adjourning the evil by removing him
10669,SECT. IV.,"to his home, and so putting him far beyond the reach of the chances of"
10670,SECT. IV.,the war.
10671,SECT. IV.,
10672,SECT. IV.,[547] Il. xvi. 436.
10673,SECT. IV.,
10674,SECT. IV.,"When Vulcan is asked by Thetis to provide arms for Achilles, he"
10675,SECT. IV.,"replies, Would that I could hide him from his fated hour, even as I can"
10676,SECT. IV.,"and will provide him with arms! Here, indeed, the expression is not to"
10677,SECT. IV.,"save, but to hide him; yet even this is beyond his power:"
10678,SECT. IV.,
10679,SECT. IV.,αἲ γάρ μιν θανάτοιο δυσηχέος ὧδε δυναίμην
10680,SECT. IV.,"νόσφιν ἀποκρύψαι, ὅτε μιν μόρος αἰνὸς ἱκάνοι[548]."
10681,SECT. IV.,
10682,SECT. IV.,[548] Il. xviii. 464.
10683,SECT. IV.,
10684,SECT. IV.,Vulcan indeed is a deity of limited powers; but in this case he seems
10685,SECT. IV.,to express a general law.
10686,SECT. IV.,
10687,SECT. IV.,~_Death inexorable to Fate or Deity._~
10688,SECT. IV.,
10689,SECT. IV.,"The death, therefore, at some time within a given space, of every"
10690,SECT. IV.,"person remaining in the state of a mortal man, was a point settled and"
10691,SECT. IV.,"immovable, and so was accordingly the αἶσα of death: but it was that"
10692,SECT. IV.,"the αἶσα was fixed, because death was fixed, and not that death was"
10693,SECT. IV.,"fixed, because αἶσα ordained it. We must distinguish between a single"
10694,SECT. IV.,"incident of a mortal career, an order which nothing can infringe,"
10695,SECT. IV.,"unchangeable but uncaused, and the supposition of a power, which causes"
10696,SECT. IV.,"that, and likewise all other parts of it, irrespective of personal"
10697,SECT. IV.,"will, whether in the gods or in men."
10698,SECT. IV.,
10699,SECT. IV.,"It appears, I think, on the whole, that αἶσα has but a limited and"
10700,SECT. IV.,equivocal connection with the idea of fate; it seems never to mean more
10701,SECT. IV.,"than the fate of a single individual, never to signify the large-handed"
10702,SECT. IV.,"destiny that grasps nations and the world. It may be overridden, as by"
10703,SECT. IV.,"the Greeks, after the battle of the ships. And the reason of this seems"
10704,SECT. IV.,"to be that its meaning has so strong a bias to the side of a moral law,"
10705,SECT. IV.,as opposed to a mere force. This comes out clearly in the sense of the
10706,SECT. IV.,"word αἴσιμος: αἴσιμα εἴδειν is little less or more, than to be a good"
10707,SECT. IV.,"man. Its predominating sense is the ordained law of right; and as such,"
10708,SECT. IV.,it is a law very liable to be broken.
10709,SECT. IV.,
10710,SECT. IV.,~_Destiny under the form of Μοῖρα._~
10711,SECT. IV.,
10712,SECT. IV.,"It is in the Μοῖρα, if anywhere, that we must seek for destiny, in the"
10713,SECT. IV.,"sense which approximates to fatalistic ideas. Here, far differently"
10714,SECT. IV.,"from αἶσα, the moral idea is subordinate in nearly all cases, and in"
10715,SECT. IV.,some it is wholly suppressed.
10716,SECT. IV.,
10717,SECT. IV.,"Like αἶσα, μοῖρα, properly means a portion or share, a part accruing to"
10718,SECT. IV.,some one under a law. Thus we have οὐδ’ αἰδοῦς μοῖραν ἔχουσιν Od. xx.
10719,SECT. IV.,"171; and παρώχηκεν δὲ πλέων νὺξ τῶν δύο μοιράων, τριτάτη δ’ ἔτι μοῖρα"
10720,SECT. IV.,λέλειπται (Il. x. 252). Thus it appears to pass into the following
10721,SECT. IV.,"senses, which may be usefully compared with those of αἶσα."
10722,SECT. IV.,
10723,SECT. IV.,The scope of its meaning is far wider: it hardly stoops to signify the
10724,SECT. IV.,destiny of a single man; Homer could not well have said (see Il. i.
10725,SECT. IV.,416.) ἐπεί νύ τοι μοῖρα μίνυνθά περ: although he can make μοῖρα as a
10726,SECT. IV.,"power, appoint a destiny _for_ a man, (Il. xxiv. 209.) it is not the"
10727,SECT. IV.,μοῖρα _of_ a man. But it is
10728,SECT. IV.,
10729,SECT. IV.,1. The appointing power as separate from any thing else. It hovers
10730,SECT. IV.,between the state of an abstraction and of a person: and it comes
10731,SECT. IV.,nearer to the latter than αἶσα. Not only have we μοῖρα κραταιὴ
10732,SECT. IV.,"γεινομένῳ ἐπένησε λίνῳ, (Il. xxiv. 209.) but especially,"
10733,SECT. IV.,
10734,SECT. IV.,τλητὸν γὰρ Μοῖραι θυμὸν θέσαν ἀνθρώποισιν[549].
10735,SECT. IV.,
10736,SECT. IV.,[549] Il. xxiv. 49.
10737,SECT. IV.,
10738,SECT. IV.,"A passage by which, unless its effect were modified from elsewhere,"
10739,SECT. IV.,the μοῖραι seem in principle to take the whole administration of moral
10740,SECT. IV.,"government into their hands, by fixing dispositions as well as outward"
10741,SECT. IV.,actions.
10742,SECT. IV.,
10743,SECT. IV.,"2. Besides being thus personal, μοῖρα reaches to mankind at large, and"
10744,SECT. IV.,"expresses a general law, in the passage last quoted."
10745,SECT. IV.,
10746,SECT. IV.,"This may be a law of good fortune, as in Od. xx. 76[550]:"
10747,SECT. IV.,
10748,SECT. IV.,"[550] Cf. Il. iii. 182, μοιρηγενές."
10749,SECT. IV.,
10750,SECT. IV.,μοῖράν τ’ ἀμμοριήν τε καταθνητῶν ἀνθρώπων.
10751,SECT. IV.,
10752,SECT. IV.,"3. Or, with an epithet, it may mean ill fortune; as in μοῖρα δυσώνυμος,"
10753,SECT. IV.,Il. xii. 116.
10754,SECT. IV.,
10755,SECT. IV.,"4. It seems very strongly to signify death, when used simply, and"
10756,SECT. IV.,"without addition, as τεῒν δ’ ἐπὶ μοῖραν ἔθηκε, in Od. xi. 560."
10757,SECT. IV.,
10758,SECT. IV.,"5. Or when in apposition, as μοῖρα θανάτοιο, Od. ii. 100, or again as"
10759,SECT. IV.,"in Il. iii. 101, θάνατος καὶ μοῖρα."
10760,SECT. IV.,
10761,SECT. IV.,"6. Or any thing ordained for mankind at large, as Od. xix. 592, the"
10762,SECT. IV.,"μοῖρα ὕπνου. You must sleep, says Penelope; for the gods have so"
10763,SECT. IV.,"ordained it, (ἐπὶ γάρ τοι ἑκάστῳ μοῖραν ἔθηκαν ἀθάνατοι θνητοῖσιν ἐπὶ"
10764,SECT. IV.,ζείδωρον ἄρουραν).
10765,SECT. IV.,
10766,SECT. IV.,"7. Μοῖρα, like αἶσα, may be the embodied will, decree, or dispensation"
10767,SECT. IV.,"of the gods. Thus we have μοῖρα θεοῦ, Od. xi. 292, where θεὸς is either"
10768,SECT. IV.,"Jupiter or possibly Apollo: and μοῖρα θεῶν, Od. iii. 269, and xxii."
10769,SECT. IV.,413. Now the names θεὸς and θεοὶ seem to be higher with Homer than any
10770,SECT. IV.,mythological name. They are his most solemn forms for the expression
10771,SECT. IV.,of the idea of deity. Thus it is remarkable that he never attaches
10772,SECT. IV.,μοῖρα directly to any Olympian person. This testifies to its signifying
10773,SECT. IV.,something larger than is conveyed by αἶσα. But it also seems to
10774,SECT. IV.,"indicate that, even if it were capable of being placed in antagonism to"
10775,SECT. IV.,"the will of one of the mythological persons, into whose forms theistic"
10776,SECT. IV.,"ideas had passed by degeneracy, yet it was not conceived as opposite to"
10777,SECT. IV.,"or separate from the divine principle, but rather as a power associated"
10778,SECT. IV.,with it.
10779,SECT. IV.,
10780,SECT. IV.,8. Though in general μοῖρα means the thing ordained without reference
10781,SECT. IV.,"to moral ideas, yet it is not always so. Μόρσιμος ordinarily means"
10782,SECT. IV.,"destined, while αἴσιμος means right. But the ideas of right and might"
10783,SECT. IV.,were not yet wholly parted. In Od. xxii. 413 it is plain that μοῖρα
10784,SECT. IV.,"θεῶν, pronounced by Ulysses over the Suitors, contains a moral element:"
10785,SECT. IV.,"for he goes on to say, οὔτινα γὰρ τίεσκον κ.τ.λ.: and so Eurymachus,"
10786,SECT. IV.,when he means to acknowledge that the death of Antinous was morally
10787,SECT. IV.,"just, says,"
10788,SECT. IV.,
10789,SECT. IV.,νῦν δ’ ὁ μὲν ἐν μοίρῃ πέφαται[551].
10790,SECT. IV.,
10791,SECT. IV.,[551] Od. xxii. 54.
10792,SECT. IV.,
10793,SECT. IV.,The presence of the moral element in this word is entirely adverse to
10794,SECT. IV.,"the theory, that it was used in the sense of fatalism. Power apart"
10795,SECT. IV.,from a personal deity has been conceived by the human mind: but moral
10796,SECT. IV.,"power, I think, in such a state of severalty, has never been made the"
10797,SECT. IV.,subject of serious speculation.
10798,SECT. IV.,
10799,SECT. IV.,"9. Μοῖρα has yet another sense, that of κοσμὸς, order. The force of the"
10800,SECT. IV.,"term κατὰ μοῖραν is generally ‘with propriety,’ while κατ’ αἶσαν is"
10801,SECT. IV.,‘with right.’
10802,SECT. IV.,
10803,SECT. IV.,"Thus in Il. xix. 256 the Greeks sit still, κατὰ μοῖραν, in order to"
10804,SECT. IV.,hear Agamemnon: and we have an instance of κατὰ μοῖραν meaning ‘with
10805,SECT. IV.,"propriety’ in Il. x. 169. Here Nestor has been chidden by Diomed, not"
10806,SECT. IV.,"for a moral offence, but for over-activity: and he replies,"
10807,SECT. IV.,
10808,SECT. IV.,"ναὶ δὴ ταῦτά γε πάντα, φίλος, κατὰ μοῖραν ἔειπες."
10809,SECT. IV.,
10810,SECT. IV.,He could not here have said κατ’ αἶσαν.
10811,SECT. IV.,
10812,SECT. IV.,~_Under the form of μόρος._~
10813,SECT. IV.,
10814,SECT. IV.,"Lastly, we come to the word μόρος. There are several shades of"
10815,SECT. IV.,distinction between it and μοῖρα.
10816,SECT. IV.,
10817,SECT. IV.,"1. It is never personified in Homer, nor even approaches to"
10818,SECT. IV.,impersonation.
10819,SECT. IV.,
10820,SECT. IV.,"2. It draws peculiarly to the dispensation of death, in conformity with"
10821,SECT. IV.,the law by which in Latin it became _mors_. See Il. xviii. 465. xxi. 133:
10822,SECT. IV.,"and, except in this connection, it does not seem to be used to express"
10823,SECT. IV.,individual destiny.
10824,SECT. IV.,
10825,SECT. IV.,3. Accordingly it is never associated with deity; in conformity with
10826,SECT. IV.,the fixed character of the dispensation of death. We have no μόρος
10827,SECT. IV.,"θεῶν, μόρος Διός."
10828,SECT. IV.,
10829,SECT. IV.,4. Yet this is not because μόρος is stronger than μοῖρα. On the
10830,SECT. IV.,"contrary, we have no case in Homer of a thing done ὑπὲρ μοῖραν, though"
10831,SECT. IV.,it is sometimes apprehended. Thus in Il. xx. 335 Neptune warns Æneas to
10832,SECT. IV.,"retire from before Achilles,"
10833,SECT. IV.,
10834,SECT. IV.,μὴ καὶ ὑπὲρ μοῖραν δόμον Ἄϊδος εἰσαφικήαι.
10835,SECT. IV.,
10836,SECT. IV.,But μόρος receives the sense of αἶσα as the law of right: a
10837,SECT. IV.,"relationship curiously maintained in _mos_, _moris_, compared with"
10838,SECT. IV.,"_mors_, _mortis_. Men bring woe upon themselves ὑπέρμορον, by"
10839,SECT. IV.,obstinate wickedness: and the crimes of Ægisthus (Od. i. 35.) have been
10840,SECT. IV.,committed ὑπέρμορον.
10841,SECT. IV.,
10842,SECT. IV.,~_General view of the Homeric Destiny._~
10843,SECT. IV.,
10844,SECT. IV.,"We thus see that, on the whole, the force of destiny, as it appears in"
10845,SECT. IV.,"Homer, although it commonly prevails, is not uniformly irresistible."
10846,SECT. IV.,"We never find the deities actually fighting against it, or it against"
10847,SECT. IV.,them. So full and large were Homer’s conceptions of the freedom of the
10848,SECT. IV.,"human will, that fate is sometimes on the point of giving way before"
10849,SECT. IV.,"the energy of his heroes, and this even when the strength of some god"
10850,SECT. IV.,"is brought in aid of it. Thus Jupiter fears, lest ὑπὲρ μόρον Achilles"
10851,SECT. IV.,should dash the Trojan walls[552] to the ground. Apollo enters the
10852,SECT. IV.,"city[553], lest the Greeks should take it ὑπὲρ μόρον on the day of"
10853,SECT. IV.,"the battle with Hector. In the Second Book, after the rush from the"
10854,SECT. IV.,"assembly, the Greeks would ὑπέρμορα have returned home, unless Juno had"
10855,SECT. IV.,urged Minerva to bestir herself by influence among them. Many things
10856,SECT. IV.,"are done contrary to αἶσα, or the ordained law of right; whereas,"
10857,SECT. IV.,"although μοῖρα is not in the abstract insurmountable, yet in fact it"
10858,SECT. IV.,"rarely is surmounted. But then the Fate of Homer, the thing spoken, is"
10859,SECT. IV.,not in conflict with him that speaks it.
10860,SECT. IV.,
10861,SECT. IV.,[552] Il. xx. 30.
10862,SECT. IV.,
10863,SECT. IV.,[553] Il. xxi. 517.
10864,SECT. IV.,
10865,SECT. IV.,We do not find in Homer the curious distinction which the speculative
10866,SECT. IV.,"mind of the Greeks afterwards worked out, between a fate representing"
10867,SECT. IV.,"the mere will of the gods, and a fixed fate higher and stronger than"
10868,SECT. IV.,they:
10869,SECT. IV.,
10870,SECT. IV.,εἰ δὲ μὴ τεταγμένα
10871,SECT. IV.,Μοῖρα τὰν ἐκ θεῶν
10872,SECT. IV.,εἶργε μὴ πλέον φέρειν[554].
10873,SECT. IV.,
10874,SECT. IV.,[554] Æsch. Ag. 993.
10875,SECT. IV.,
10876,SECT. IV.,And again in Herodotus[555]: τὴν πεπρωμένην μοίρην ἀδύνατά ἐστιν
10877,SECT. IV.,ἀποφυγέειν καὶ θεῷ.
10878,SECT. IV.,
10879,SECT. IV.,[555] Herod. i. 91.
10880,SECT. IV.,
10881,SECT. IV.,"While this, on the one side, was the course of speculation, the course"
10882,SECT. IV.,of poetic thought was towards a complete impersonation of Destiny in
10883,SECT. IV.,"the three Fates, representing an image so congenial, as a poetic image"
10884,SECT. IV.,"only, to the human mind, that it found its way into the romance poetry"
10885,SECT. IV.,of Christian Italy.
10886,SECT. IV.,
10887,SECT. IV.,"Upon the whole, it appears at any rate most probable, that Homer had"
10888,SECT. IV.,not formed the conception of a law extrinsic to all volition human and
10889,SECT. IV.,"divine, and so powerful as to override it."
10890,SECT. IV.,
10891,SECT. IV.,It is hardly to be conceived that Homer would have treated a successful
10892,SECT. IV.,resistance to the laws of Destiny as lying within the possible reach of
10893,SECT. IV.,"mankind, had he deemed it to be a power independent of, and superior"
10894,SECT. IV.,"to, the Divine Will; because he always represents the latter as"
10895,SECT. IV.,decisive and supreme over human fortunes.
10896,SECT. IV.,
10897,SECT. IV.,I think that the primary ideas conveyed in the terms μοῖρα and Fatum
10898,SECT. IV.,"will not be found, when examined, to agree. _Fatum_ is the decree"
10899,SECT. IV.,without reason; the _sic volo sic jubeo_; and the idea of it is the
10900,SECT. IV.,"result of the long, wearisome, despairing experience of bewildered man,"
10901,SECT. IV.,after the world has lost the freshness and the joy of its childhood.
10902,SECT. IV.,"The μοῖρα, or share, is a distribution made according to a law or moral"
10903,SECT. IV.,"purpose: it cannot, without parting from its nature, be blind: its"
10904,SECT. IV.,"tendency in Homer rather is, as we see in Il. xxiv. 49, to grow into a"
10905,SECT. IV.,sort of rival Providence.
10906,SECT. IV.,
10907,SECT. IV.,The arguments to an opposite effect are surely inconclusive[556]. The
10908,SECT. IV.,"question raised by the Scales of Jupiter is, not what the springs may"
10909,SECT. IV.,"be which determine the movement of the world, but simply what is his"
10910,SECT. IV.,foreknowledge of the direction it will take. These representations
10911,SECT. IV.,would be perfectly consistent with belief in the supremacy (so to
10912,SECT. IV.,"speak) of Chance: and while we may admit that, inasmuch as they are not"
10913,SECT. IV.,"produced for the information of men, they must indicate a limitation in"
10914,SECT. IV.,"Jupiter, we should not mistake the nature of that limitation."
10915,SECT. IV.,
10916,SECT. IV.,"[556] Enumerated in Nägelsbach, iii. 7-9."
10917,SECT. IV.,
10918,SECT. IV.,"Again, we must not suppose that because some particular deity deplores"
10919,SECT. IV.,"the course of destiny, therefore that course is in opposition to the"
10920,SECT. IV.,general deliberation and decision of Olympus.
10921,SECT. IV.,
10922,SECT. IV.,"And when, as is commonly the case, we find the deities cooperating with"
10923,SECT. IV.,"μοῖρα, the assumption that they are its servants, seems to be wholly"
10924,SECT. IV.,"unwarranted. It seems much more natural to suppose that the μοῖρα, to"
10925,SECT. IV.,"which they are giving effect, is simply the divine will: especially as,"
10926,SECT. IV.,"though we find single gods, Neptune or Apollo, for example, cooperating"
10927,SECT. IV.,"with μοῖρα, I doubt whether this is ever represented of the gods at"
10928,SECT. IV.,large and their supreme decrees.
10929,SECT. IV.,
10930,SECT. IV.,"In order to solve the general question, what after all can be more"
10931,SECT. IV.,"reasonable than to look to the main action of the poems, and inquire"
10932,SECT. IV.,what power or what counsel it is which takes effect through the medium
10933,SECT. IV.,"of their machinery as a whole? If this be the test, there is no room"
10934,SECT. IV.,for doubt upon the issue. In the Iliad it is the Διὸς βουλὴ (Il. i. 5):
10935,SECT. IV.,"the determination of Olympus, into which Jupiter had wisely allowed"
10936,SECT. IV.,"his own opposite inclinations to merge. In the Odyssey[557], it is"
10937,SECT. IV.,"the decision of the same tribunal, at the instance of Minerva, and"
10938,SECT. IV.,"with Neptune alone dissentient. Upon the whole, for the poems and the"
10939,SECT. IV.,"day of Homer, I cannot but think that both the supremacy of godhead"
10940,SECT. IV.,"as a whole, and the freedom of man remain, if somewhat darkened, yet"
10941,SECT. IV.,"certainly unsubverted. The μοῖρα of Homer may, it is probable, be no"
10942,SECT. IV.,"more and no less in the main than that θέσφατον, or divinely uttered"
10943,SECT. IV.,"decree, which he sometimes uses in such a manner as to admit of the"
10944,SECT. IV.,supposition that they were really synonymous.

10947,SECT. IV.,
10948,SECT. IV.,"At the same time we do not find, nor could we expect to find, in Homer"
10949,SECT. IV.,"any clear assertion of the majesty of the true Divine Will, as the"
10950,SECT. IV.,mainspring that moves the universe. That is emphatically a Christian
10951,SECT. IV.,"sentiment, which is conveyed in the lofty formula of Dante:"
10952,SECT. IV.,
10953,SECT. IV.,"Così si vuol colà, dove si puote"
10954,SECT. IV.,Ciò che si vuole.
10955,SECT. IV.,

10957,SECT. IV.,Can what he wills.
10958,SECT. IV.,
10959,SECT. IV.,"The Fate of Homer may indeed logically embrace a germ, which will"
10960,SECT. IV.,"afterwards expand into the idea of a power extrinsic to Deity, and"
10961,SECT. IV.,"able to overrule it. We may argue to show that the representation,"
10962,SECT. IV.,"perseveringly developed, means as much as this. But then such"
10963,SECT. IV.,"representations in Homer are not perseveringly, much less are they"
10964,SECT. IV.,"unilaterally, developed. They have not been thought through even to"
10965,SECT. IV.,"their legitimate consequences, and far less to those which appear"
10966,SECT. IV.,"to arise from the following out, not of a full truth, but of some"
10967,SECT. IV.,"particular and severed aspect of it. Taken at the worst, Destiny in"
10968,SECT. IV.,"Homer broods like a cloud in a distant quarter of the sky, silently"
10969,SECT. IV.,"gathering the might which, when ripe, is to engage in obstinate and"
10970,SECT. IV.,unending conflict with deity. But for this work the material is not yet
10971,SECT. IV.,prepared; and practically neither μοῖρα nor αἶσα much crosses the work
10972,SECT. IV.,"of Divine government, such as it is conceived and exhibited in Homer."
10973,SECT. IV.,I pass on to the second Class.

10977,SECT. IV.,"Among the Greeks, and even in Homer, every tree, every fountain, all"
10978,SECT. IV.,"things inanimate, that either vegetated or moved, had their indwelling"
10979,SECT. IV.,"deity. Homer, however, represents the infancy of that system, and"
10980,SECT. IV.,"though he impersonates many other local agencies, he gives to none so"
10981,SECT. IV.,active a personality as to Rivers. Ulysses in his distress addresses
10982,SECT. IV.,the god of the Scherian river[558]; and is answered by the staying
10983,SECT. IV.,of the current. Simois is addressed personally by Xanthus[559]; and
10984,SECT. IV.,"Xanthus himself, by virtue of his local power, is promoted to the"
10985,SECT. IV.,"honour of contending with Vulcan, the god of fire, a member of the"
10986,SECT. IV.,"Olympian Court, and a son of Jupiter and Juno. So the Spercheus[560] is"

10995,SECT. IV.,"The perpetual movement which inheres in the essence of a river,"
10996,SECT. IV.,combined with the visibility which separates it from mere atmospherical
10997,SECT. IV.,"currents, seems to connect it more closely than any other natural"
10998,SECT. IV.,object with the idea of life. It is most interesting to observe how
10999,SECT. IV.,the sentiment here expressed seems to have worked in ages widely
11000,SECT. IV.,"distant, upon great poets of differing nations, temperaments, and"
11001,SECT. IV.,"circumstances, after their differing manners. Homer does not impute"
11002,SECT. IV.,feelings to a River; but he impersonates it with a treatment different
11003,SECT. IV.,"to that which he applies to groves, fountain, or meadow. Now these"
11004,SECT. IV.,personifications though not yet disused (especially in the English
11005,SECT. IV.,"poetry of the last century), have become far less real and effective"
11006,SECT. IV.,"for the human mind, since the Gospel opened to us the unseen world"
11007,SECT. IV.,"with its crowd of ethereal inhabitants. Observe, accordingly, how a"
11008,SECT. IV.,"feeling identical with that of Homer, a tendency to invest outward"
11009,SECT. IV.,"nature with vitality and action, in these more recent times takes a"
11010,SECT. IV.,"different form. The great Dante, more than two thousand years later in"
11011,SECT. IV.,"the line of human descent, without personifying, yet ascribes feeling"
11012,SECT. IV.,"to a river; he imagines the Po, after its tumultuous headlong descent"
11013,SECT. IV.,"with all its feeders from the mountains, longing for peace, and seeking"
11014,SECT. IV.,it by repairing to the sea. Francesca da Rimini thus describes her
11015,SECT. IV.,birth-place;
11016,SECT. IV.,
11017,SECT. IV.,"Siede la Terra, dove nata fui,"

11033,SECT. IV.,"worldly life, and intends to show that a system of shadows, when men"
11034,SECT. IV.,"really appropriate and digest the truth it has, is better for them"
11035,SECT. IV.,"than to have a system of substances around them, and yet to remain"
11036,SECT. IV.,"unpenetrated by it, he describes that system of shadows by recalling"
11037,SECT. IV.,two of its vivid personifications[562].

11046,SECT. IV.,Parliament of the supernal world at the beginning of the Twentieth
11047,SECT. IV.,"Iliad, all are represented. Even here, however, the distinction is"
11048,SECT. IV.,preserved: the Rivers attend as it were in person; but the rest by
11049,SECT. IV.,"deputy, that is, by their proper indwelling and presiding Spirits;"

11060,SECT. IV.,~_The Harpies of Homer._~
11061,SECT. IV.,
11062,SECT. IV.,"The Harpies, Ἁρπυῖαι, of Homer have been, I think, truly described as"
11063,SECT. IV.,"‘nothing but personified storm-winds[564].’ They have no connection,"
11064,SECT. IV.,"when jointly viewed, with the moral order, except that they may,"
11065,SECT. IV.,"as mere carriers, take a subordinate part in the fulfilment of a"
11066,SECT. IV.,"moral purpose, which is quite as true of the Winds, personified or"
11067,SECT. IV.,"unpersonified. The Harpy Ποδάργη is personified individually, as the"
11068,SECT. IV.,"mother who bears to Zephyr the two deathless horses of Achilles,"
11069,SECT. IV.,Xanthus and Balius[565]; but apparently for no other purpose than one
11070,SECT. IV.,purely relative. The classical passage respecting the Harpies is that
11071,SECT. IV.,"in Od. xx. 61-79, which forms a part of the prayer of Penelope to"
11072,SECT. IV.,"Diana. The object of the matron’s petition is that, wearied out with"
11073,SECT. IV.,"her sorrows, she may die, and this in one of two modes: either by the"
11074,SECT. IV.,"arrows of the goddess; or else, that a hurricane may seize her, and,"
11075,SECT. IV.,"driving her along the paths of air, deposit her in the channels of"
11076,SECT. IV.,"Ocean, that is to say, the place of the dead. Then she proceeds to"
11077,SECT. IV.,"illustrate this last mode of death, of which she has named θύελλα as"
11078,SECT. IV.,"the instrument, by the tale of the daughters of Pandareus, who, having"
11079,SECT. IV.,"lost their parents, were in an extraordinary manner petted by the"
11080,SECT. IV.,"goddesses. Aphrodite fed them, Here gave them sense and beauty, Artemis"
11081,SECT. IV.,"stature, Pallas endowed them with skill. And, lastly, Aphrodite went"
11082,SECT. IV.,to Olympus to induce Jupiter to provide for their marriage. But while
11083,SECT. IV.,"she was away on this errand, the Harpies carried off these maidens, and"
11084,SECT. IV.,"gave them to the Ἐρινύες, ἀμφιπολεύειν, to be their servants, as it"
11085,SECT. IV.,"is sometimes rendered, but, as I should venture to construe it, ‘for"
11086,SECT. IV.,"them, i. e. the Ἐρινύες, to deal with.’ It is evident that, in this"
11087,SECT. IV.,"curious legend, the Harpies are introduced to exemplify nothing more"
11088,SECT. IV.,than the part which Penelope had previously referred to the θύελλα;
11089,SECT. IV.,"and these powers, who represent Hurricane or Squall, and in whose"
11090,SECT. IV.,"agency lies the gist of the story, appear to have been in this matter"
11091,SECT. IV.,"the ministers of the Ἐρινύες, beings of a very different order. These"
11092,SECT. IV.,"beings are evidently introduced, though entirely beyond the parallel"
11093,SECT. IV.,"of the θύελλα, in order to complete the moral. The only other case in"
11094,SECT. IV.,"which Homer introduces the Harpies is in a line, twice repeated, where"
11095,SECT. IV.,Penelope supposes that they may have carried Ulysses off (ἀκλειῶς)
11096,SECT. IV.,"ingloriously[566], i. e. so as to rob him in death of his due meed"
11097,SECT. IV.,of fame. And this Friedreich well compares with part of a passage in
11098,SECT. IV.,"the Book of Job, which is as follows, chap. xxvii. 20, 21. ‘A tempest"
11099,SECT. IV.,"stealeth him away in the night: the east wind carrieth him away, and he"
11100,SECT. IV.,departeth; and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.’

11132,SECT. IV.,
11133,SECT. IV.,Let us first collect the facts respecting their position in Homer.
11134,SECT. IV.,
11135,SECT. IV.,"1. In the narrative of Phœnix we find that when, at the instigation"
11136,SECT. IV.,"of his mother, he had sought the embraces of a παλλακὶς, for whom his"
11137,SECT. IV.,"father had a passion, the father, incensed, invoked the Ἐρινύες to make"
11138,SECT. IV.,"him childless. ‘This curse,’ he says, ‘the gods (θεοὶ) accomplished,"
11139,SECT. IV.,"and the subterranean Jupiter, and awful Persephone,’ Il. ix. 449-57."
11140,SECT. IV.,
11141,SECT. IV.,"2. The mother of Meleager, on account of his having slaughtered her"
11142,SECT. IV.,"brother, invoked Aïdes and Persephone, beseeching them to slay that"
11143,SECT. IV.,"hero: whereupon the Erinūs, here called ἠεροφοῖτις, ‘that walketh in"
11144,SECT. IV.,"darkness,’ heard her from Erebus, and the city was besieged. But here"
11145,SECT. IV.,"the Erinūs appears to act, if not wholly in favour of Meleager, yet"
11146,SECT. IV.,"against his mother. The city is assaulted, forced, and set on fire."
11147,SECT. IV.,"The family, including the mother who had cursed him, entreat Meleager"
11148,SECT. IV.,"to deliver them, and attempt to attract his favour by splendid promises"
11149,SECT. IV.,"of a demesne, to be conferred on him by the public. Only when the"
11150,SECT. IV.,palace itself is assailed does he consent. He repels the enemy; the
11151,SECT. IV.,"demesne is not given him: and, on account of his thus relenting only at"
11152,SECT. IV.,"the last moment, Phœnix quotes him as a warning example, for Achilles"
11153,SECT. IV.,to avoid. (Il. ix. 565-603.)
11154,SECT. IV.,
11155,SECT. IV.,"3. In Il. xv. 204, when Neptune seems inclined to be refractory, Iris"
11156,SECT. IV.,"reminds him that the Erinūs will act with Jupiter, because he is the"
11157,SECT. IV.,elder brother:
11158,SECT. IV.,
11159,SECT. IV.,"οἶσθ’, ὡς πρεσβυτέροισιν Ἐρινύες αἰὲν ἕπονται."
11160,SECT. IV.,
11161,SECT. IV.,"And upon this hint Neptune at once alters his tone, allows that she has"
11162,SECT. IV.,"spoken κατὰ μοῖραν, and complies with the command that she has brought."
11163,SECT. IV.,
11164,SECT. IV.,"4. In Il. xix. Agamemnon, while he admits his ἄτη, (v. 87), throws,"
11165,SECT. IV.,"we might say shuffles off, the blame of it upon Jupiter, Destiny, and"
11166,SECT. IV.,Erinūs:
11167,SECT. IV.,
11168,SECT. IV.,"ἐγὼ δ’ οὐκ αἴτιός εἰμι,"
11169,SECT. IV.,ἀλλὰ Ζεὺς καὶ Μοῖρα καὶ ἠεροφοῖτις Ἐρινύς.
11170,SECT. IV.,
11171,SECT. IV.,"5. In vv. 258-60 of the same Book, the same personage invokes as"
11172,SECT. IV.,"witnesses to his asseveration concerning Briseis, 1. Jupiter, 2. the"
11173,SECT. IV.,"Earth, 3. the Sun, 4. the Ἐρινύες, ‘who dwell beneath the earth, and"
11174,SECT. IV.,punish the perjured.’
11175,SECT. IV.,
11176,SECT. IV.,"6. In v. 418 of the same Book, after the horse Xanthus, receiving a"
11177,SECT. IV.,"voice by the gift of Juno, has given to Achilles a dark indication"
11178,SECT. IV.,"of his coming fate, the Erinues interfere to prevent any further"
11179,SECT. IV.,disclosures:

11181,SECT. IV.,ὣς ἄρα φωνήσαντος Ἐρινύες ἔσχεθον αὐδήν.
11182,SECT. IV.,
11183,SECT. IV.,"7. When, in the Theomachy, Minerva has laid Mars prostrate by a blow,"
11184,SECT. IV.,she taunts him by telling him he may in his overthrow recognise the
11185,SECT. IV.,"Ἐρινύες of his mother Juno, invoked upon him for having changed sides"
11186,SECT. IV.,in the contest (Il. xxi. 410-14).
11187,SECT. IV.,
11188,SECT. IV.,"8. In the Odyssey (ii. 135), Telemachus apprehends that, if he"
11189,SECT. IV.,"dismisses his mother, he will have to encounter, among other evils, the"
11190,SECT. IV.,Erinuës whom she will invoke upon him.
11191,SECT. IV.,
11192,SECT. IV.,"9. Epicaste, the mother of Œdipus, is speedily removed from the face"
11193,SECT. IV.,of earth for her hapless incest. Œdipus himself lives and reigns: but
11194,SECT. IV.,"suffers many sorrows, which the Erinuës of Epicaste (μητρὸς Ἐρινύες, as"
11195,SECT. IV.,in Il. xx. 412) bring upon him.
11196,SECT. IV.,
11197,SECT. IV.,"10. Melampus, a rich subject of Neleus in Pylos, is imprisoned for a"
11198,SECT. IV.,"whole year in the house of Phylacus, and has his property seized or"
11199,SECT. IV.,"confiscated, on account of the daughter of Neleus, and of his grievous"
11200,SECT. IV.,"ἄτη, which the goddess, the hard-striking[570] Erinūs, brought into his"
11201,SECT. IV.,mind (Od. xv. 233):

11210,SECT. IV.,"But he escaped from death, and paid, i.e. accomplished, the strange"
11211,SECT. IV.,act that Neleus had imposed as the condition of obtaining the command
11212,SECT. IV.,"over his daughter’s hand. He thus procured it for his brother, termed"
11213,SECT. IV.,"in the post-Homeric tradition Bias. This condition was, that he should"
11214,SECT. IV.,bring off to Pylos the cows which were the property of Iphicles (and
11215,SECT. IV.,apparently of Phylacus). He was caught at Phylace in the attempt: but
11216,SECT. IV.,"after a year Iphicles released him, apparently in consideration of"
11217,SECT. IV.,"benefit derived from his prophetic knowledge, Od. xv. 228-38, and xi."
11218,SECT. IV.,287-97.
11219,SECT. IV.,
11220,SECT. IV.,"11. In Od. xvii. 475, 6, Ulysses, when Antinous had hurled the stool"
11221,SECT. IV.,"at him, invokes upon that Suitor in return the anger of the gods and"
11222,SECT. IV.,"Erinuës (εἴ πού γε εἰσὶν, if such there be) of the poor."
11223,SECT. IV.,
11224,SECT. IV.,"12. Lastly, in Od. xx. 78, as we have seen, the Harpies deliver the"
11225,SECT. IV.,daughter of Pandareus into the hands of the Erinuës.
11226,SECT. IV.,
11227,SECT. IV.,"We have thus a very copious supply of information from Homer, in no"
11228,SECT. IV.,"less than twelve passages, every one of which represents the action of"
11229,SECT. IV.,"these singular beings in a fresh and varied light: and the question is,"
11230,SECT. IV.,"what is the one common idea, which is sufficiently comprehensive to"
11231,SECT. IV.,"include them all, and is also in harmony with the purport of each?"
11232,SECT. IV.,
11233,SECT. IV.,~_Vindicators of the moral order._~
11234,SECT. IV.,
11235,SECT. IV.,"I answer, that the Erinuës are, in the Homeric system, the"
11236,SECT. IV.,"never-failing champions, because they are the practical avengers, of"
11237,SECT. IV.,"the natural and moral order, at all times, under all circumstances,"
11238,SECT. IV.,and against all persons whatsoever. They have nothing to do with the
11239,SECT. IV.,prevention of crime: but they appear to be the principal instruments
11240,SECT. IV.,"for its punishment, especially here, but likewise hereafter. This,"
11241,SECT. IV.,"however, is only a part of their function. They are the sworn servants"
11242,SECT. IV.,"of a fixed order of the universe, apart from, anterior to, and"
11243,SECT. IV.,"independent of, all volition, divine or human: and they avenge the"
11244,SECT. IV.,"infraction of that order, not merely as a law of right opposed to"
11245,SECT. IV.,"wrong, but as a law of order opposed to disorder; they are goddesses"
11246,SECT. IV.,"themselves, but they are wholly apart from the Olympian dispensation,"
11247,SECT. IV.,"sometimes put in conjunction with deities of the mythology, sometimes"
11248,SECT. IV.,"apart from, sometimes in opposition to them. They are, in short, an"
11249,SECT. IV.,"early and poetical expression of that philosophy, which even in"
11250,SECT. IV.,Christian times has seemed to seek a foundation for the supreme laws
11251,SECT. IV.,"more or less dissociated from, and wholly exterior to, the Divine Will:"
11252,SECT. IV.,"the philosophy, not of Destiny, but of the ‘Immutable Morality’ of"
11253,SECT. IV.,Cudworth and his school: the philosophy harmonizing with the Ideas of
11254,SECT. IV.,the Platonists: the philosophy of which we have a distant glimpse in
11255,SECT. IV.,"the words of St. Bernard, _incommutabile est, quod ne ipsi quidem Deo"
11256,SECT. IV.,mutare liberum est_[571]: and which Butler has presented to us in the
11257,SECT. IV.,mild forms of his admirably balanced wisdom.

11259,SECT. IV.,"[571] De Præcepto et Dispensatione, sect. 8."
11260,SECT. IV.,
11261,SECT. IV.,"I will take first, as the criteria of this proposition, the remarkable"
11262,SECT. IV.,cases in which we find the Erinuës of Homer in qualified conflict
11263,SECT. IV.,"with Deity. It is commonly held, that in the Nineteenth Iliad the"
11264,SECT. IV.,Erinuës interfere to prevent Xanthus from telling too much to Achilles.
11265,SECT. IV.,No doubt Homer effects this purpose by their means: but they never
11266,SECT. IV.,interfere with the aim of prevention. It is the natural order which had
11267,SECT. IV.,been broken by the act of Juno in conferring the gift of speech upon
11268,SECT. IV.,"a horse, and which they by their interposition mean to vindicate and"
11269,SECT. IV.,reestablish.
11270,SECT. IV.,
11271,SECT. IV.,They play the same part in the case of the daughters of Pandareus.
11272,SECT. IV.,"It is plain that the goddesses of Olympus had vied with one another,"
11273,SECT. IV.,"after an unprecedented and abnormal manner, in loading these damsels"
11274,SECT. IV.,"with an extraordinary accumulation of gifts. Everything, even food,"
11275,SECT. IV.,came to them by the direct and immediate agency of their Immortal
11276,SECT. IV.,handmaids: and at last Jupiter was actually besought to find them
11277,SECT. IV.,"husbands. All this lay far beyond, and was therefore in derogation of"
11278,SECT. IV.,the ordinary laws for the government of the world: it left no space for
11279,SECT. IV.,"human volition, effort, or discipline: it thus struck at the root of"
11280,SECT. IV.,"the moral order; and on this ground the Erinuës interfere, apparently"
11281,SECT. IV.,"employing the Hurricanes as their agents, to remove these maidens from"
11282,SECT. IV.,"the earth, and to deposit them upon the Ocean stream, by the place of"
11283,SECT. IV.,the dead.
11284,SECT. IV.,
11285,SECT. IV.,~_Their operation upon the Immortals._~
11286,SECT. IV.,
11287,SECT. IV.,"I do not know whether, over and above the infraction of natural order"
11288,SECT. IV.,"which I have mentioned, there may not have been another cause for their"
11289,SECT. IV.,intervention in the special manner in which the endowments had been
11290,SECT. IV.,conveyed: for where we find Juno granting to them ‘beauty and sense
11291,SECT. IV.,"beyond all other women[572],’ it appears as if she had travelled into"
11292,SECT. IV.,"the province not only of Venus, but of the great Minerva, with whose"
11293,SECT. IV.,prerogatives I doubt whether we ever find any similar interference
11294,SECT. IV.,allowed by Homer. It is therefore just possible that the Erinuës may
11295,SECT. IV.,"here interpose on behalf of the laws and arrangements of Olympus, as"
11296,SECT. IV.,well as of those belonging to Earth.
11297,SECT. IV.,
11298,SECT. IV.,[572] Od. xx. 70.
11299,SECT. IV.,
11300,SECT. IV.,The explanation which I have proposed will entirely fit the warning of
11301,SECT. IV.,"Iris to Neptune. The natural order, which assigns the prerogatives of"
11302,SECT. IV.,"government to the elder, in other words, the right of primogeniture,"
11303,SECT. IV.,"is a rule for the Immortals, as well as for mankind, since it is taken"
11304,SECT. IV.,"to be founded upon a basis more profound than will, which was not,"
11305,SECT. IV.,"and could hardly be for Homer, even when divine, either the source or"
11306,SECT. IV.,the master of creation. But while the Erinuës are thus on the side of
11307,SECT. IV.,"Jupiter, and while the recollection of them at once induces Neptune"
11308,SECT. IV.,"to succumb, they are not on that account in any sense or degree his"
11309,SECT. IV.,ministers.
11310,SECT. IV.,
11311,SECT. IV.,"On the same side with him we find them, where they are invoked by"
11312,SECT. IV.,"Ulysses, as the Erinuës, together with the gods, of the poor: or as"
11313,SECT. IV.,"when Agamemnon lays upon Erinūs, along with Jupiter and Destiny, the"
11314,SECT. IV.,"blame of errors, for which notwithstanding the Greeks rightly held"
11315,SECT. IV.,"him[573], and even he could not deny himself to be, responsible. Yet"
11316,SECT. IV.,"we are never told that the Erinuës move at the bidding of Jupiter, or"
11317,SECT. IV.,of any other Olympian deity. Here we seem to have a glimpse into the
11318,SECT. IV.,deeper truths of the heroic age. Theology had already wandered from
11319,SECT. IV.,its orbit: it was fast losing all the severity and majesty of truth;
11320,SECT. IV.,"but the deep roots which God had given to the sense of responsibility,"
11321,SECT. IV.,"and the expectation of retribution, in the human mind, had not yet"
11322,SECT. IV.,been wholly plucked up; and Homer’s fine sense of truth forbade him to
11323,SECT. IV.,"connect the most practical, and at the same time, the sternest parts of"
11324,SECT. IV.,"his religious system, with the gorgeous glare of his Olympus, and with"
11325,SECT. IV.,the moral delinquencies of many among its inhabitants.
11326,SECT. IV.,
11327,SECT. IV.,"[573] Il. xix. 85, 6."
11328,SECT. IV.,
11329,SECT. IV.,"As the seniority of Jupiter is upheld by the Erinuës, so in like manner"
11330,SECT. IV.,"are the parental rights of Juno, which had been infringed by Mars, when"
11331,SECT. IV.,"he changed sides in the war. Here again, however, it appears as if"
11332,SECT. IV.,more than the mere wish or influence of Juno had been set aside: for
11333,SECT. IV.,"Mars had given a positive promise to fight for the Greeks, and it is"
11334,SECT. IV.,probable that the breach of this engagement constituted the chief part
11335,SECT. IV.,of the offence that they were to punish[574].

11339,SECT. IV.,~_Their connection with Aides and Persephone._~
11340,SECT. IV.,
11341,SECT. IV.,"Where the Erinuës touch upon the province of other deities at all,"
11342,SECT. IV.,it is upon that of Persephone and of Aïdes. If Homer associated
11343,SECT. IV.,"Persephone, as I believe he did, with the Eastern nursery of his race,"
11344,SECT. IV.,"it was natural enough that, as has been the case, this part of his"
11345,SECT. IV.,theo-mythology should remain comparatively untainted. And certainly
11346,SECT. IV.,the Homeric relation between the Erinuës and the sovereigns of the
11347,SECT. IV.,"nether world is a close one. When, in the Ninth Iliad, Althea, grasping"
11348,SECT. IV.,"the earth in her vehemence, as if to lay the strong hand upon the"
11349,SECT. IV.,"object of her prayer, invoked Aidoneus and Persephone to put her son"
11350,SECT. IV.,"to death, the Poet proceeds to say that the Erinūs heard her: the"
11351,SECT. IV.,"Erinūs who stalks in the darkness heard her, and heard her out of"
11352,SECT. IV.,Erebus[575]. In the case of Phœnix and Amyntor we have exactly the
11353,SECT. IV.,"converse. Here the Erinūs was invoked, and it was Aides with Persephone"
11354,SECT. IV.,that answered the prayer. In both these instances it must moreover be
11355,SECT. IV.,"remembered, that the question is about present and even immediate,"
11356,SECT. IV.,"not about posthumous retribution. We cannot, then, refuse to admit,"
11357,SECT. IV.,that in this manner Persephone with Aidoneus is placed in an intimate
11358,SECT. IV.,"relation with the administration of retributive justice on earth, and"
11359,SECT. IV.,during the course of human life there: and if the Erinuës are to be
11360,SECT. IV.,"considered as abstractions, having their basis only in some ulterior"
11361,SECT. IV.,"impersonation, Persephone and Aidoneus offer the only objects on whom"
11362,SECT. IV.,"we can suppose them to depend. It seems to me, however, that they are"
11363,SECT. IV.,"not reciprocally identified, although they are profoundly connected,"
11364,SECT. IV.,and although we read in the connection a very ancient testimony to a
11365,SECT. IV.,"primitive conviction in mankind, that they must look to the powers of"
11366,SECT. IV.,the other world to redress the deranged balances of this.
11367,SECT. IV.,
11368,SECT. IV.,[575] Il. ix. 569-72.
11369,SECT. IV.,
11370,SECT. IV.,"Conformably to these ideas, we find that, in the Nineteenth Iliad, the"
11371,SECT. IV.,abode of the Erinuës is fixed ὑπὸ γαῖαν: and it is made clear from the
11372,SECT. IV.,"passage (259, 60,) that their avenging office, which is so commonly"
11373,SECT. IV.,"exercised in this world, reaches also to the other."
11374,SECT. IV.,
11375,SECT. IV.,"From the character of the Erinuës, as vindicators of an order having"
11376,SECT. IV.,deeper foundations than those which any volition could either lay or
11377,SECT. IV.,"shake, there arises that natural association of them with Destiny,"
11378,SECT. IV.,which we see expressed in the speech of Agamemnon[576]. Both have in
11379,SECT. IV.,"common this idea, that they are not dependent on mere volition. They"
11380,SECT. IV.,"differ in these points; that Destiny prescribes and effectuates action,"
11381,SECT. IV.,while the Erinuës only punish transgression; and that Destiny is but
11382,SECT. IV.,"feebly moral, whereas the Erinuës are profoundly charged with ethical"
11383,SECT. IV.,colouring. They represent that side of the idea of Destiny which
11384,SECT. IV.,"alone can, after being resolutely scrutinized, retain a hold upon our"
11385,SECT. IV.,interest.

11389,SECT. IV.,~_Their operation upon man._~
11390,SECT. IV.,
11391,SECT. IV.,"All the residue of the threads will, I think, run out easily. It"
11392,SECT. IV.,"follows from what has been said, that in their aspect towards man, the"
11393,SECT. IV.,"Erinuës are not indeed administrators of the moral laws themselves,"
11394,SECT. IV.,but administrators of their sanctions. So they punish the infraction
11395,SECT. IV.,of the rights inhering in all natural relations: the rights of the
11396,SECT. IV.,"poor, as Ulysses protests to Antinous; of a father, as in the case"
11397,SECT. IV.,"of Amyntor; of a mother, as in the case of Penelope. But they do"
11398,SECT. IV.,much more than punish the infraction of the rights of persons; it is
11399,SECT. IV.,"the infraction of right as right, which they resent as a substantive"
11400,SECT. IV.,offence. Let us accordingly notice the function of the Erinūs in those
11401,SECT. IV.,cases where there has been fault on both sides. An offender is not
11402,SECT. IV.,"therefore secure, because the person who invokes the Erinūs upon him"
11403,SECT. IV.,is an offender too. The father of Phœnix gave the original occasion to
11404,SECT. IV.,"his offence, by an offence of his own: but Phœnix is punished at his"
11405,SECT. IV.,"instance notwithstanding, because the thing which he implores is not"
11406,SECT. IV.,"a personal favour, but is a vindication of the ὑψίποδες νόμοι[577],"
11407,SECT. IV.,"violated by the incest of his son; a thing right to be done, whether"
11408,SECT. IV.,asked or not. The case of Althea and Meleager illustrates this truth
11409,SECT. IV.,in a manner still more lively. When she obtained the intervention of
11410,SECT. IV.,"the Erinūs, she at once suffered by it. The city of Œneus was all"
11411,SECT. IV.,"but subjected to the horrors of capture: she was brought, in bitter"
11412,SECT. IV.,"humiliation, to supplicate the aid of the son, on whose head she had"
11413,SECT. IV.,"just invoked the stroke of doom. From this we must conclude, which"
11414,SECT. IV.,"indeed is not difficult, that the Poet regarded her prayer as in itself"
11415,SECT. IV.,unnatural and cruel; so that the fulfilment of it involved immediate
11416,SECT. IV.,"suffering to herself. But, on the other hand, Meleager had offended"
11417,SECT. IV.,"too, in the slaughter of a near relative. Therefore, although his pride"
11418,SECT. IV.,"might well be gratified when he saw king, priest, and people, with"
11419,SECT. IV.,"his humbled mother, at his feet, and proffering their choicest gift"
11420,SECT. IV.,"in order to appease him, yet for that original offence, and for his"
11421,SECT. IV.,"obstinately refusing to arm until fire was in the city, he must receive"
11422,SECT. IV.,"his punishment likewise, in vindication of the moral laws; accordingly,"
11423,SECT. IV.,"after he had repulsed the enemy, he never received the demesne[578]."

11428,SECT. IV.,
11429,SECT. IV.,The case of Meleager assists to illustrate that of Œdipus and Epicaste.
11430,SECT. IV.,"Both of these unhappy persons had offended against the moral laws,"
11431,SECT. IV.,"though it was unwittingly (ἀϊδρείῃσι νόοιο); one, the mother-bride,"
11432,SECT. IV.,was immediately put out of the way: the survivor was still pursued by
11433,SECT. IV.,"the μητρὸς Ἐρινύες. We see here how insufficient the idea of a curse,"
11434,SECT. IV.,"invoked at will, is to explain the action of these remarkable Powers;"
11435,SECT. IV.,for it does not appear that there was any mother’s curse in the case:
11436,SECT. IV.,"but, because the natural laws were broken in a matter where the mother"
11437,SECT. IV.,"was the occasion, therefore, while both suffer, the sufferings of the"
11438,SECT. IV.,"son are attributed to the Erinuës of the mother; the defenders, because"
11439,SECT. IV.,"the avengers, of the sanctity of a mother’s place in relation to her"
11440,SECT. IV.,son.
11441,SECT. IV.,
11442,SECT. IV.,"In the case of Melampus, it appears that his undertaking to obtain"
11443,SECT. IV.,"the cows of Iphicles or Phylacus was an ἄτη βαρεῖα, a grave error,"
11444,SECT. IV.,"beginning in a temptation suggested to him by the Erinūs, and ending in"
11445,SECT. IV.,calamity. The seizure of these animals would probably be regarded as no
11446,SECT. IV.,"moral offence: and if so, any error that could lie in the engagement"
11447,SECT. IV.,"to seize them would be, according to Homeric estimate, in the nature"
11448,SECT. IV.,"of folly rather than of crime. We seem to see, then, in this place,"
11449,SECT. IV.,"that the range of Erinūs, like that of Atè, embraced at a certain"
11450,SECT. IV.,point the prudential as well as the strictly moral laws: nor is there
11451,SECT. IV.,"involved in this idea any violent departure from the true standard, for"
11452,SECT. IV.,"great imprudences are most commonly, and almost invariably, in near"
11453,SECT. IV.,connection with some form of moral defect.
11454,SECT. IV.,
11455,SECT. IV.,"It is however also to be observed, that in this place the Erinūs"
11456,SECT. IV.,suggests the ἄτη. The idea lying at the root of this representation
11457,SECT. IV.,"appears to be the profound one, that the exercise of an evil will is"
11458,SECT. IV.,"in itself penal: and that when the mind is already disposed to offend,"
11459,SECT. IV.,"retributive justice may take the form of a permission, encouragement,"
11460,SECT. IV.,"or incitement, to commit the offence. We have already seen a very"
11461,SECT. IV.,remarkable development of this idea in the hardening agency of Minerva
11462,SECT. IV.,upon the Suitors[579].

11466,SECT. IV.,"According to the view of them which has here been given, though I could"
11467,SECT. IV.,"not class the Erinuës with the traditive deities, it is clear that"
11468,SECT. IV.,"they must represent, under metamorphosis, an important association of"
11469,SECT. IV.,ideas belonging to primitive tradition.

11471,SECT. IV.,Let us now turn to the Sixth Class.

11473,SECT. IV.,~_The translation of mortals._~
11474,SECT. IV.,
11475,SECT. IV.,Those for whom it was a mental necessity to animate with deity even the
11476,SECT. IV.,"mute powers of nature, could not but find modes of associating man,"
11477,SECT. IV.,"who stood nearer to the Immortals, with them and their conditions of"
11478,SECT. IV.,existence.
11479,SECT. IV.,
11480,SECT. IV.,These modes were chiefly three:
11481,SECT. IV.,
11482,SECT. IV.,"The first, that of translation during life."
11483,SECT. IV.,
11484,SECT. IV.,"The second, that of deification after death."
11485,SECT. IV.,
11486,SECT. IV.,"The third, the conception of races intermediate between deity and"
11487,SECT. IV.,humanity.
11488,SECT. IV.,
11489,SECT. IV.,"And it was perhaps not the simple working of a fervid imagination, but"
11490,SECT. IV.,"also an offshoot from this profound and powerful tendency, which has"
11491,SECT. IV.,filled the pages of Homer with continual efforts to deify what was most
11492,SECT. IV.,"excellent, or most conspicuous, in the mind or in the person of living"
11493,SECT. IV.,man.
11494,SECT. IV.,
11495,SECT. IV.,"The mode of translation during life was early in date, and was rarely"
11496,SECT. IV.,"used, for not only are the Homeric examples of it few, but he records"
11497,SECT. IV.,no contemporary instance.
11498,SECT. IV.,
11499,SECT. IV.,"Ganymede[580], the son of Tros, was taken up to heaven by the Immortals"
11500,SECT. IV.,"on account of his beauty, that he might live among them. Tithonus, his"
11501,SECT. IV.,"grand-nephew, son of Laomedon, was, as we are left to infer, similarly"
11502,SECT. IV.,"translated during life, to be the husband of Aurora (in Homer Eos), or"
11503,SECT. IV.,"the morning: for Homer makes him known to us in that capacity, though"
11504,SECT. IV.,"he does not mention the translation. In like manner, she carried up,"
11505,SECT. IV.,"and placed among the Immortals for his beauty, Cleitus, one of the"
11506,SECT. IV.,descendants of Melampus[581]. A similar operation to that which was
11507,SECT. IV.,"performed upon Tithonus may have been designed in the case of Orion,"
11508,SECT. IV.,"who was the choice of Aurora, and whose career, in consequence of the"
11509,SECT. IV.,"jealousy of the Immortals, was cut short by the arrows of Diana[582]."
11510,SECT. IV.,The course of these legends seems to stop suddenly in the Greek
11511,SECT. IV.,mythology at the point where they are replaced by deification: and the
11512,SECT. IV.,"connection of Aurora, as the principal agent, with three out of the"
11513,SECT. IV.,"four, (the other, too, is Asiatic, as being in the family of Dardanus,)"
11514,SECT. IV.,seems to be an unequivocal sign of their eastern character. Homer
11515,SECT. IV.,"places the dwelling of Ἤως at a distant point of the East, near the"
11516,SECT. IV.,place where θάλασσα communicates with Ocean.

11524,SECT. IV.,~_The deification of mortals._~
11525,SECT. IV.,
11526,SECT. IV.,In the age of Homer the very first names have hardly been entered
11527,SECT. IV.,"in the class of deified heroes. Ino, the daughter of Cadmus, may be"
11528,SECT. IV.,"said to stand at the head of the list, from the distinct assertion of"
11529,SECT. IV.,"her translation, and from her being placed, as the ally of Ulysses,"
11530,SECT. IV.,in continued relations with mortal men[583]. Of her also it is said
11531,SECT. IV.,that she had obtained divine honours; and nearly the same assertion
11532,SECT. IV.,is made of Castor and Pollux. But they perform no offices towards man
11533,SECT. IV.,while yet in this life. Of this Ino is the only instance. She appears
11534,SECT. IV.,"to be Phœnician rather than Greek, and thus to belong perhaps to an"
11535,SECT. IV.,"older, clearly to a distinct mythology. Hercules, the only one of these"
11536,SECT. IV.,"persons who entirely fulfils the conditions of a hero, is admitted to"
11537,SECT. IV.,"the banquets of the gods, and united with Hebe[584]: yet he is not"
11538,SECT. IV.,"all in Olympus, for his εἴδωλον, endowed with voice and feeling, and"
11539,SECT. IV.,"bearing martial accoutrements, is the terror of the Dead. It is not"
11540,SECT. IV.,"easy to explain fully this divided state. I cannot but think, however,"
11541,SECT. IV.,"that we see here at work that principle of disintegration, which solved"
11542,SECT. IV.,all riddles of character by making one individual into more than one:
11543,SECT. IV.,"beginning, at least for earth, with that Helen in Egypt, who was made"
11544,SECT. IV.,the depository of the better qualities that post-Homeric times could
11545,SECT. IV.,"not recognise in Helen of Troy. Although the son of Jupiter, Hercules"
11546,SECT. IV.,"had on earth, through a sheer mistake, been subject to a destiny"
11547,SECT. IV.,of grinding toil. His original extraction and personality stand in
11548,SECT. IV.,sharp contrast with the restless and painful destiny of his life.
11549,SECT. IV.,"Death severs these one from the other, but Homer, contemplating each"
11550,SECT. IV.,"as a whole, endows the last also with personality, and gives it a"
11551,SECT. IV.,reflection in the lower world of its earthly course and aspect: while
11552,SECT. IV.,"the Jove-born Hercules, as it were by a natural spring, mounts up to"
11553,SECT. IV.,heaven[585]. At the same time there is no more conspicuous example than
11554,SECT. IV.,"Hercules, of that counter-principle of accumulation, by which legendary"
11555,SECT. IV.,tradition heaps upon favourite heroes all acts not distinctly otherwise
11556,SECT. IV.,"appropriated, which appear to harmonize with their characters; and"

11568,SECT. IV.,It must not be forgotten that this passage respecting Hercules was
11569,SECT. IV.,sharply challenged by the Alexandrian critics. This challenge is
11570,SECT. IV.,"discussed, and its justice affirmed by Nitzsch[586]. Such authorities"
11571,SECT. IV.,"must not be defrauded of their weight. But for my own part, I do not"
11572,SECT. IV.,"find a proof of spuriousness even in the real inconsistencies of Homer,"
11573,SECT. IV.,where he is dealing with subjects beyond the range of common life and
11574,SECT. IV.,"experience. Still less can it be universally admitted, that what are"
11575,SECT. IV.,called his inconsistencies are really such. They will often be found to
11576,SECT. IV.,require nothing but the application of a more comprehensive rule for
11577,SECT. IV.,their adjustment.

11583,SECT. IV.,"he appears not wholly unlike the shade of Hercules, a dreamy image"

11591,SECT. IV.,It would be hazardous to build any opinion exclusively on the two

11598,SECT. IV.,in any degree to what was afterwards the order of deified Heroes.
11599,SECT. IV.,"There are, however, some other indications, that belong immediately"
11600,SECT. IV.,"to the living, and that point the same way. Such is the promise to"
11601,SECT. IV.,"Menelaus[587], that instead of dying he should be translated to"
11602,SECT. IV.,"Elysium, because he was the son-in-law of Jupiter. And this suggests"
11603,SECT. IV.,other notes of preparation already found in Homer. Ulysses[588]
11604,SECT. IV.,"promises Nausicaa that, when he has reached his own country, he will"
11605,SECT. IV.,"continue to invoke her all his life long, _like a god_. The invocation"
11606,SECT. IV.,of the Dead was common. It was not practised only in illustrious
11607,SECT. IV.,"cases like that of Patroclus. After their battle with the Cicones,"
11608,SECT. IV.,Ulysses[589] and his crews thrice invoked their slaughtered comrades.
11609,SECT. IV.,"A system of divine parentage was the fit, one might almost say the"
11610,SECT. IV.,certain preparation for a scheme of divine honours after death; and of
11611,SECT. IV.,"such parentage many of Homer’s heroes could boast. Again, Peleus was"
11612,SECT. IV.,"married to a goddess, and the gods in mass attended the wedding. By"
11613,SECT. IV.,"thus bringing the inhabitants of Olympus down to the earth, Homer laid"
11614,SECT. IV.,the ground for bringing the denizens of earth into Olympus.

11622,SECT. IV.,"There is yet a further sign, which, though perhaps the least palpable,"
11623,SECT. IV.,"is, when well considered, the most striking of all. It is this; that"
11624,SECT. IV.,"sacrifice is offered, in the Odyssey, to the Shades of the departed."
11625,SECT. IV.,It is not indeed animal sacrifice that is actually offered. The gift
11626,SECT. IV.,"consists of honey and milk, with wine, water, and flour[590]: but"
11627,SECT. IV.,"Ulysses distinctly promises that, on his return to Ithaca, he will"
11628,SECT. IV.,"supply this defect by offering a heifer in their honour, and a sheep"
11629,SECT. IV.,"all black to Tiresias in particular. Moreover, he distinctly recognises"

11641,SECT. IV.,"former. Together with the mixed offering above described, and the"
11642,SECT. IV.,"promise of a regular sacrifice on his return home, Ulysses permitted"
11643,SECT. IV.,the Shades to drink of the blood of the sheep which he immolated on

11658,SECT. IV.,"We have now, lastly, to consider the kindred of the gods, or races"
11659,SECT. IV.,"intermediate between deity and humanity, which Homer has introduced in"
11660,SECT. IV.,the Odyssey exclusively.
11661,SECT. IV.,
11662,SECT. IV.,"These are certainly three, perhaps four;"
11663,SECT. IV.,
11664,SECT. IV.,1. The Cyclopes.

11666,SECT. IV.,3. The Phæacians.
11667,SECT. IV.,
11668,SECT. IV.,It may also be probable that we should add
11669,SECT. IV.,
11670,SECT. IV.,4. Æolus Hippotades and his family.
11671,SECT. IV.,
11672,SECT. IV.,"Among them all, the Cyclopes, children of Neptune, offer, as a work of"
11673,SECT. IV.,"art, by far the most successful and satisfactory result. In every point"
11674,SECT. IV.,they are placed at the greatest possible distance from human society
11675,SECT. IV.,"and its conventions. Man is small, the Cyclops huge. Man is weak, the"
11676,SECT. IV.,"Cyclops powerful. Man is gregarious, the Cyclops is isolated. Man, for"
11677,SECT. IV.,"Homer, is refined; the Cyclops is a cannibal. Man inquires, searches,"
11678,SECT. IV.,"designs, constructs, advances, in a word, is progressive: the Cyclops"
11679,SECT. IV.,"simply uses the shelter and the food that nature finds for him, and is"
11680,SECT. IV.,"thoroughly stationary. Yet, while man is subject to death, the Cyclops"
11681,SECT. IV.,"lives on, or vegetates at least, and transmits the privileges of his"
11682,SECT. IV.,race by virtue of its high original. The relaxed morality of the divine
11683,SECT. IV.,"seed, as compared with man, is traceable even in their slight customs."
11684,SECT. IV.,They are polygamous:
11685,SECT. IV.,
11686,SECT. IV.,θεμιστεύει δὲ ἕκαστος
11687,SECT. IV.,παίδων ἠδ’ ἀλόχων[593].

11689,SECT. IV.,[593] Od. ix. 115.
11690,SECT. IV.,
11691,SECT. IV.,From their personal characters the moral element has been entirely
11692,SECT. IV.,"dismissed. Polyphemus is a huge mass of force, seasoned perhaps with"
11693,SECT. IV.,"cunning, certainly with falseness. This union of a superhuman life with"
11694,SECT. IV.,"the brutal, that dwells in solitude, and has none of its angles rubbed"
11695,SECT. IV.,"down by the mutual contact between members of a race, produces a mixed"
11696,SECT. IV.,"result of extreme ferocity, childishness, and a kind of horrible glee,"
11697,SECT. IV.,which as a work of art is most striking and successful. We may justly
11698,SECT. IV.,think much of Caliban: but Caliban cannot for a moment be compared to
11699,SECT. IV.,"Polyphemus. It is equitable, however, to remember that contrast with"
11700,SECT. IV.,"Ariel, which must have been a governing condition in the creation of"
11701,SECT. IV.,"Shakespeare, required a nature which should be fatuous and grovelling,"
11702,SECT. IV.,as well as coarse.
11703,SECT. IV.,
11704,SECT. IV.,"To feed Polyphemus, what lies nearest him, namely, the Læstrygonian"
11705,SECT. IV.,"adventure, has, perhaps, been starved. Again we are introduced to cruel"
11706,SECT. IV.,"Giants and to cannibalism, but with a great scantiness of detail. Their"
11707,SECT. IV.,individuality is scarcely established. Their only marked qualities they
11708,SECT. IV.,"hold in common with the Cyclopes, except as to a single point, namely,"
11709,SECT. IV.,"that they live gregariously. We see their city, and are introduced"
11710,SECT. IV.,"to their king, their queen, and their princess[594]. But a too great"
11711,SECT. IV.,likeness to the Cyclops still suggests itself; and it is probable that
11712,SECT. IV.,"in both the one and the other Homer set before him, among the materials"
11713,SECT. IV.,"of his work, that old tradition of powerful beings, allied to the"
11714,SECT. IV.,"deity, and yet rebellious against him, which meets us in so many forms,"
11715,SECT. IV.,"dispersed about the Homeric poems, and which the later tradition, by"
11716,SECT. IV.,"further multiplication and variety, resolved into a living chaos."
11717,SECT. IV.,
11718,SECT. IV.,[594] Od. x. 105-15.
11719,SECT. IV.,
11720,SECT. IV.,The Phæacians appear to stand quite in another category. While the
11721,SECT. IV.,"Cyclops has no trace of deity but in superhuman force, the Phæacians"
11722,SECT. IV.,"have no pretensions of this kind. They are not even immortal, nor"
11723,SECT. IV.,"are they wholly removed from man, for they are accustomed to carry"
11724,SECT. IV.,passengers by sea; they seem really to be meant in a measure to
11725,SECT. IV.,represent the θεοὶ ῥεῖα ζώοντες. We must not look too rigidly in them
11726,SECT. IV.,"for notes of the divine character, but rather for the abundance,"
11727,SECT. IV.,"opulence, ease, and refinement of the divine condition. Hence Homer"
11728,SECT. IV.,lavishes all the simple wealth of his imagination upon the palace and
11729,SECT. IV.,"garden of Alcinous, which far exceeds any possessions he has assigned"
11730,SECT. IV.,"to ordinary men. This additional splendour of itself proves, if proof"
11731,SECT. IV.,"were wanted, that the picture is ideal. The same amount of ornament"
11732,SECT. IV.,"assigned to the palace of Menelaus would, from the contrast with fact,"
11733,SECT. IV.,probably have been frigid to his hearers.
11734,SECT. IV.,
11735,SECT. IV.,From the games and athletic exercises of this people all the ruder and
11736,SECT. IV.,"more violent sports are excluded. Navigation, to others so formidable,"
11737,SECT. IV.,for them is conducted by a spontaneous force and intelligence residing
11738,SECT. IV.,"in their ships; which annihilates distance, and at last excites even"
11739,SECT. IV.,the jealousy of Neptune (Od. viii. 555-69). We find in the island and
11740,SECT. IV.,"in its history no poverty, no grief, no care, no want; all is fair to"
11741,SECT. IV.,"see and to enjoy. But we feel thankful to Homer that he has not here,"
11742,SECT. IV.,"as in the case of the Cyclops, made kin with the gods entail a marked"
11743,SECT. IV.,moral or intellectual inferiority upon the sons of men; no purer or
11744,SECT. IV.,more graceful piece of humanity is to be found among the creations of
11745,SECT. IV.,"the human brain, than his picture of Nausicaa. She combines in herself"
11746,SECT. IV.,"all that earth could suggest of bright, and pure, and fair. Still it"
11747,SECT. IV.,cannot be denied that levity and vanity are rather conspicuous in the
11748,SECT. IV.,"Phæacian men. They shew off, among other sports, their boxing and"
11749,SECT. IV.,"wrestling, before they know what Ulysses is made of. When they know"
11750,SECT. IV.,"it, Alcinous informs him in an off-hand way that they do not pretend"
11751,SECT. IV.,to excellence in that class of sports[595]. After the dancers have
11752,SECT. IV.,"performed, Ulysses with great tact at once passes a high compliment"
11753,SECT. IV.,"upon them. Alcinous, delighted with the praise, cries aloud, ‘Phæacian"
11754,SECT. IV.,chiefs! this stranger appears to me to be an extremely sensible
11755,SECT. IV.,man[596].’

11760,SECT. IV.,
11761,SECT. IV.,"It appears, however, most likely that, besides the mythical element"
11762,SECT. IV.,"in two of them, Homer may have had some basis of maritime report, and"
11763,SECT. IV.,"thus of presumed fact, for his delineations of all these three races;"
11764,SECT. IV.,"that, with an unlimited license of embellishment, he, nevertheless,"
11765,SECT. IV.,may have intended in each case to keep unbroken the tie between
11766,SECT. IV.,"his own tale, and the voyages of Ulysses, founded upon Phœnician"
11767,SECT. IV.,"geography, as reported in his time. I form this opinion partly from"
11768,SECT. IV.,"some singularities in the Phæacian character, which, as they are not"
11769,SECT. IV.,"in keeping with any poetic idea, may probably have had an historic"
11770,SECT. IV.,"aim, though I cannot be persuaded that they afford a foundation broad"
11771,SECT. IV.,"enough for the full theory of Mure[597], if he conceives the Phæacians"
11772,SECT. IV.,of the Odyssey to be strictly a portrait of the Phœnicians. Partly I
11773,SECT. IV.,"draw the inference from the want of clear severance in the ideals, on"
11774,SECT. IV.,which the characters of the Cyclops and the Læstrygones are severally
11775,SECT. IV.,founded. The remarkable natural characteristic of Læstrygonia which he
11776,SECT. IV.,"has given us, its perpetual day, supports the same hypothesis. What"
11777,SECT. IV.,would otherwise amount to poverty in the imagery is sufficiently
11778,SECT. IV.,"accounted for, if we assume that he meant to describe two savage"
11779,SECT. IV.,"tribes, that inhabited the latitudes with which he was dealing; and"
11780,SECT. IV.,"that, feeling himself bound to brutality in each case, he has, under"
11781,SECT. IV.,"these unfavourable circumstances, varied it as much as he could. Unless"
11782,SECT. IV.,"it had been to preserve an historical or mythological tradition, the"
11783,SECT. IV.,Læstrygonian adventure might hardly have deserved introduction into the
11784,SECT. IV.,"Odyssey. Plainly, on the other hand, he is not to be held responsible"
11785,SECT. IV.,for all that he has put down while he believed himself to be conforming
11786,SECT. IV.,"to narratives of fact, in the same manner and degree as if he had been"
11787,SECT. IV.,presenting us with a picture in which his fancy had only to work at
11788,SECT. IV.,will.

11794,SECT. IV.,"winds; and his six sons are married to his six daughters, as αἰδοίαι"
11795,SECT. IV.,ἄλοχοι[598]. The word φίλος may bear the sense of relationship:
11796,SECT. IV.,immortality seems to be of necessity involved in the charge over
11797,SECT. IV.,"the winds, who are themselves in the Iliad (in this point varying"
11798,SECT. IV.,poetically from the Odyssey) invested with deity[599]: and the marriage
11799,SECT. IV.,"of the sons to the daughters affords another absolute proof: for this,"
11800,SECT. IV.,"which would have been incest, μέγα ἔργον, among men, is evidently set"

11810,SECT. IV.,and their chieftains. But it is very difficult to understand his place
11811,SECT. IV.,"in the poem, and the reasons of it. The gift of Zephyr, and the folly"
11812,SECT. IV.,"of the crew in letting out the whole pack of winds, end only in the"
11813,SECT. IV.,"return of Ulysses to Æolia, and in his being dismissed from thence as"
11814,SECT. IV.,"one hateful to the gods, which he was not. This Æolus neither seems"
11815,SECT. IV.,"to be required for, nor to contribute to, the general purpose of the"
11816,SECT. IV.,poem: nor to represent any ancient tradition: nor can we in any manner
11817,SECT. IV.,"connect him with Æolus, the great national personage whose descendants"
11818,SECT. IV.,"were so illustrious, for that Æolus was clearly taken to be the son or"
11819,SECT. IV.,immediate descendant of Jupiter; so that he could not have been called
11820,SECT. IV.,the son of Hippotas. Perhaps the origin of his place in the Odyssey
11821,SECT. IV.,was to be found in some Phœnician report about storms in the northern
11822,SECT. IV.,"seas, where Æolia is evidently placed in complete isolation, figured"
11823,SECT. IV.,"by the sheer and steep rock of the coast, and by the metal wall which"

11825,SECT. IV.,the appearance of which from a distance entirely accords with this
11826,SECT. IV.,"particular of inaccessibility. The whole picture, representing as it"
11827,SECT. IV.,"does, first, the ferocity of the winds, and, secondly, the existence"
11828,SECT. IV.,"of an efficient control over them, evidently embodies two features"
11829,SECT. IV.,which could not but enter variously and prominently into the tales
11830,SECT. IV.,"of Phœnician mariners; first, the fierceness of the gales prevailing"
11831,SECT. IV.,"in those outer latitudes, to deter others from attempting them; and"

11885,SECT. V.,of the gods. And perhaps the idea intended to be conveyed is that of
11886,SECT. V.,"a family which has grown into a sept or clan, having this for its"
11887,SECT. V.,"distinctive character, that all the members of it, great and small,"
11888,SECT. V.,have either a nearer or a more remote relationship to the head. Of the
11889,SECT. V.,"minor deities, in various cases it is recorded, that they are daughters"
11890,SECT. V.,"of Jupiter; such as the Muses, the Prayers, and the Nymphs of most"
11891,SECT. V.,"orders. But these have the appearance of belonging to Homer’s poetry,"
11892,SECT. V.,"more than to his mythology. Among male deities, the sons of Jupiter are"
11893,SECT. V.,all in Olympus: those of Neptune take lower rank.
11894,SECT. V.,
11895,SECT. V.,"Whatever be its relation to the family _nucleus_, the community of"
11896,SECT. V.,"Olympus is fully formed. Besides Jupiter the head, and the ordinary"
11897,SECT. V.,"assembly, its Council or Court, which answers to the βουλὴ of the"
11898,SECT. V.,"Greeks, it has its Agorè, a greater Assembly or Parliament called"
11899,SECT. V.,"together upon crises of extraordinary solemnity, such as the decision"
11900,SECT. V.,by main force of the fate of Troy.
11901,SECT. V.,
11902,SECT. V.,"But as we have no example, except the factious and utterly odious"
11903,SECT. V.,"Thersites, of any one of the commonalty who takes an actual part in"
11904,SECT. V.,"debate among men, so the minor deities, too, are mute in heaven."
11905,SECT. V.,
11906,SECT. V.,"Nay, the resemblance is even closer than this. The Greek βουλὴ, and"
11907,SECT. V.,"also the ἀγορὴ, have their speaking or leading personages, and they"
11908,SECT. V.,"likewise have each their silent members. The leaders are Agamemnon,"
11909,SECT. V.,"Nestor, Ulysses, and Diomed; the last-named chieftain always with"
11910,SECT. V.,"modesty, as a person lately come to full age. Achilles doubtless would"
11911,SECT. V.,"have had to be added, if the action of the poem had permitted him"
11912,SECT. V.,"to appear throughout its debates. But we never hear of the Ajaxes,"
11913,SECT. V.,"Idomeneus, or chiefs like Eurypylus, as taking any active share in the"
11914,SECT. V.,proceedings. Even so the discussions of Olympus appear to be conducted
11915,SECT. V.,"commonly by Jupiter, Juno, Neptune[601], Minerva, and Apollo[602]. Once"
11916,SECT. V.,"Vulcan interposes, in his mother’s interest: possibly he may have been"
11917,SECT. V.,suggested to the Poet by Thersites[603] as a terrestrial counterpart.
11918,SECT. V.,"The Sun appeals to the Assembly in the Odyssey, as a party in his own"
11919,SECT. V.,"cause: but neither he nor Venus, nor Mars, nor Mercury, nor any other"
11920,SECT. V.,"subordinate deity, ever appears as taking part in a discussion."

11930,SECT. V.,"Eighth and Twentieth Books[604]. The other, or ordinary meetings, have"
11931,SECT. V.,no distinctive name. We may know them by their not depending on any
11932,SECT. V.,"summons or introduction, and by the frequent mention, either of the"
11933,SECT. V.,"banquet as proceeding, or of the cup as in the hands of the deities."

11937,SECT. V.,"be pressed too far, for they do not, like the Greek βουλὴ, commonly"
11938,SECT. V.,"precede an Assembly. It is to be remembered, that the βουλὴ was an"
11939,SECT. V.,"Hellenic institution, and that the gods were not exclusively Hellenic,"

11959,SECT. V.,for business. This there could not be in the Assemblies of the Olympian
11960,SECT. V.,gods. Neither does respect for authority and for tradition well
11961,SECT. V.,"harmonize with the idea of beings, who are possessed of unbounded,"
11962,SECT. V.,"or at the least of greatly extended intelligence. Thus, like the"
11963,SECT. V.,"individual deities, the divine Assemblies, and the entire Polity, are"
11964,SECT. V.,deprived of the greatest moral safeguards of their counterparts on
11965,SECT. V.,"earth. The consequence is, that their ethical tone is much lower. Force"
11966,SECT. V.,is the only effective sanction of authority among the Immortals. This
11967,SECT. V.,is curiously exhibited in the Theomachy: for that battle takes place
11968,SECT. V.,"when the fate of Troy, which formed the matter in dispute, has already"
11969,SECT. V.,"been long ago decided. Whenever a difficulty arises, which will bear"
11970,SECT. V.,"that mode of treatment, Jupiter resorts to the threat of using it, even"
11971,SECT. V.,"against divinities so dignified and powerful as Minerva, Neptune, and"
11972,SECT. V.,"Juno. Sometimes, indeed, he parades it by anticipation, even when no"
11973,SECT. V.,"symptom of disaffection has yet been exhibited.[607] So, on the other"

11989,SECT. V.,"But, although moral principle and religious reverence are absent, two"
11990,SECT. V.,principles of considerable value and utility remain. One of them is a
11991,SECT. V.,"certain courtesy or comity, which prevails in the absence of strong"
11992,SECT. V.,"countervailing causes. Secondly, the power of intelligence is very"
11993,SECT. V.,visible in the working of their polity. It is not the mere wish of
11994,SECT. V.,"Jupiter, it is his counsel, which is fulfilled in the Trojan war. And"
11995,SECT. V.,"again, it is not his individual counsel, but it is the decision which"
11996,SECT. V.,he adopts in compliance with the general sentiment of the gods[609]. He
11997,SECT. V.,"could be well content to let Troy stand, because of the abundance of"
11998,SECT. V.,its offerings; but he sees that if he attempts to give effect to such
11999,SECT. V.,"a plan as he would personally prefer, he must encounter the stubborn"
12000,SECT. V.,"resistance of the three strongest deities, Neptune, Juno, and Minerva."
12001,SECT. V.,Perhaps this difference of opinion might issue in the shape of a
12002,SECT. V.,"war in heaven, and that war might follow the same course as the one"

12042,SECT. V.,entertained before they are called upon to give an account of their
12043,SECT. V.,business[612]. And this hospitable practice extends even to the
12044,SECT. V.,treatment of those who are charged with important communications; so
12045,SECT. V.,that Bellerophon is entertained for nine full days by the king of
12046,SECT. V.,"Lycia, while he has in his pocket the roll containing a request for"
12047,SECT. V.,him to be put to death[613]. In exact conformity with this manner of

12061,SECT. V.,the superiority of the members of the Olympian Court. We find it in
12062,SECT. V.,the express declaration of Calypso[615]. We find it perhaps yet more
12063,SECT. V.,clearly noted in the comparison between Venus and Thetis: for we have
12064,SECT. V.,"seen, as to the former of these deities, her extreme feebleness and"
12065,SECT. V.,"incapacity in everything, except as regards the particular impulse that"
12066,SECT. V.,"she represents. Thetis, on the other hand, is full of activity and"
12067,SECT. V.,intelligence; and is gifted with bodily powers sufficient to fly like
12068,SECT. V.,"a hawk from Olympus, when carrying the celestial arms (whose inherent"
12069,SECT. V.,"buoyancy, however, must not be forgotten[616]). Yet, doubtless because"

12082,SECT. V.,~_Their unity imperfect._~
12083,SECT. V.,
12084,SECT. V.,Though the body of θεοὶ serve as an unity to point a moral in the
12085,SECT. V.,"abstract, there is practically a wonderful want of unity and of common"
12086,SECT. V.,or corporate feeling among them. This is figured in the Judgment
12087,SECT. V.,"of Paris: in the love of Neptune for the Cyclops, who renounce the"
12088,SECT. V.,"authority of Jupiter: again in his aversion to the Phæacians, who are"
12089,SECT. V.,"so beloved by the gods in general, that they appear in their proper"
12090,SECT. V.,shape at the religious festivals of those favoured islanders[618].
12091,SECT. V.,
12092,SECT. V.,[618] Od. vii. 201-3.
12093,SECT. V.,
12094,SECT. V.,"But notwithstanding this want of the genuine corporate spirit, and"
12095,SECT. V.,notwithstanding the prevalence of essentially selfish appetite as the
12096,SECT. V.,"rule of life with the greater part, at any rate, of the Immortals,"
12097,SECT. V.,it would not be just to say that the principle of unity in the
12098,SECT. V.,Divine Government is wholly destroyed by the Homeric polytheism. The
12099,SECT. V.,"superiority of Jupiter, though it does not amount to supremacy in the"
12100,SECT. V.,"stricter sense[619], is yet sufficiently decided to place him far above"
12101,SECT. V.,"any other single deity in sheer power. Therefore, when considered"
12102,SECT. V.,"as the executive of the Olympian system, he is upon the whole equal"
12103,SECT. V.,"to his work. He may be deceived, and so baffled for a moment, as by"
12104,SECT. V.,Juno in the Fourteenth Iliad; but it is for a moment only. Or the
12105,SECT. V.,"insubordination of some particular divinity may approach to resistance,"
12106,SECT. V.,"like that of Neptune in the Fifteenth: but, upon admonition, conscious"
12107,SECT. V.,inferiority soon brings the matter to a close. So much for the
12108,SECT. V.,"execution of divine behests. As to the legislative process, however,"
12109,SECT. V.,"heaven strictly follows earth, with only such exceptions as are"
12110,SECT. V.,accounted for by the difference in the constituent elements.
12111,SECT. V.,
12112,SECT. V.,[619] Nägelsbach carries it even to this point. Hom. Theol. Abschn. II.
12113,SECT. V.,17.
12114,SECT. V.,
12115,SECT. V.,"The influence or even the menaces of a powerful leader, the moral force"
12116,SECT. V.,"of persuasion, the comparison of the means of coercive action on this"
12117,SECT. V.,"side and on that, and again the composition of wills and opinions"
12118,SECT. V.,"to obtain a joint result, all these, the leading processes by which"
12119,SECT. V.,"free institutions work on earth, with substantial identity, though"
12120,SECT. V.,"with more awkwardness of form and less of genial freedom, as might be"
12121,SECT. V.,"expected in transplanted ideas, are also the processes by which supreme"
12122,SECT. V.,and providential decrees are arrived at. Of the degree to which this
12123,SECT. V.,"principle of free polity prevails, we can have no better criterion than"
12124,SECT. V.,"in the fate of Troy. It fell, not merely from the personal prudence of"
12125,SECT. V.,"Jupiter, but because acting as a βασιλεὺς in heaven, like Agamemnon"
12126,SECT. V.,"upon earth, he yielded to the preponderating influence of that"
12127,SECT. V.,"section in Olympus, which was indeed apparently less numerous, but of"
12128,SECT. V.,"commanding strength, influence, and activity."
12129,SECT. V.,
12130,SECT. V.,"Nor would it be just to Homer and his Olympus to forget, that in"
12131,SECT. V.,"yielding to the powerful party led by Juno, Neptune, and Minerva,"
12132,SECT. V.,"Jupiter was also yielding up the vicious, and sealing the triumph of"
12133,SECT. V.,the virtuous cause.
12134,SECT. V.,
12135,SECT. V.,"Thus, then, while we see the spirit of anthropophuism breaking down the"
12136,SECT. V.,"principle of the Unity of God, from its being too feeble and too blind"
12137,SECT. V.,"to maintain the pure traditions in which it was conveyed, it is still"
12138,SECT. V.,curious to the last degree to observe the order and symmetry of the
12139,SECT. V.,"Greek mind, even in its destructive processes. For, as we have found,"
12140,SECT. V.,"it arranges its groups of deities around a centre, by the principle"
12141,SECT. V.,"that creates a Family: and then gives them community of counsel, and"
12142,SECT. V.,"unity of action, by the principle that maintains a State. What is this,"
12143,SECT. V.,"but to bring in the resources and expedients, which our human state"
12144,SECT. V.,"supplied, to repair, after a sort, the havock which it had made in the"
12145,SECT. V.,Divine Idea?
12146,SECT. V.,
12147,SECT. V.,~_The system not uniform._~
12148,SECT. V.,
12149,SECT. V.,"But although symmetry was thus far, if not studied, yet spontaneously"
12150,SECT. V.,"produced, we have ample proof that Homer neither inherited nor invented"
12151,SECT. V.,"for his gods any uniform and consistent code of rules, intellectual,"
12152,SECT. V.,"moral, or political. Neither, again, in the region of sense did he"
12153,SECT. V.,make any general provision to determine the conditions of divine being
12154,SECT. V.,"and action for his gods as an order, or even for particular classes"
12155,SECT. V.,"of them. The want of such consistency is, indeed, among the striking"
12156,SECT. V.,proofs of the profound dualism of origin in his Theo-mythology. All
12157,SECT. V.,"that we can do is to observe his prevailing modes of treatment, and"
12158,SECT. V.,"collect a general meaning from them. Proceeding thus, we shall find"
12159,SECT. V.,that the class of Immortals enjoys in various ways a marked superiority
12160,SECT. V.,"to man; but the degrees of this superiority, as they are nowhere"
12161,SECT. V.,"precisely defined, so they vary greatly in the cases of the different"
12162,SECT. V.,"deities: and when, striking off all the particular characteristics of"
12163,SECT. V.,"individual members of the system, we attempt to embody what is common"
12164,SECT. V.,"to them all, we leave but a slight and jejune residuum."
12165,SECT. V.,
12166,SECT. V.,Nor is the classification of the differences a regular one. If we
12167,SECT. V.,"compare his delineations of some lower with some higher deities,"
12168,SECT. V.,we must be struck with finding considerable appearances of want of
12169,SECT. V.,"analogy between them. Some inferior persons of the same order, as we"
12170,SECT. V.,"shall see, may excel in particular gifts, even those who are on the"
12171,SECT. V.,"whole their superiors. Thus Circe, and even the Sirens, have powers"
12172,SECT. V.,"greater apparently than, in the same subject-matter, Mercury or Vulcan."
12173,SECT. V.,"Heterogeneous origin, and imperfect assimilation, afford the true"
12174,SECT. V.,explanation of these phenomena.
12175,SECT. V.,
12176,SECT. V.,"It may be laid down as a general rule, that the divine life of Olympus,"
12177,SECT. V.,"wherever it reproduces the human, reproduces it in a degraded form."
12178,SECT. V.,"Enjoyment and indulgence, when carried from earth to heaven, lose that"
12179,SECT. V.,"limit of honourable relation to labour as necessary restoratives, which"
12180,SECT. V.,alone makes them respectable on earth.
12181,SECT. V.,
12182,SECT. V.,"In general, the chief note of deity with Homer is emancipation from"
12183,SECT. V.,the restraints of the moral law. Though the Homeric gods have not
12184,SECT. V.,"yet ceased to be the vindicators of morality upon earth, they have"
12185,SECT. V.,personally ceased to observe its rules either for or among themselves.
12186,SECT. V.,
12187,SECT. V.,"As compared with men in conduct, they are generally characterised by"
12188,SECT. V.,"superior force and intellect, but by inferior morality."
12189,SECT. V.,
12190,SECT. V.,They do not appear to have been governed in their relations towards
12191,SECT. V.,one another by any motives drawn either from the law of right and
12192,SECT. V.,"justice, or from that of affection: unless--an exception which confirms"
12193,SECT. V.,the rule--where the attachment belonging to the human relation of
12194,SECT. V.,"parent and child is faintly reflected among the Immortals, as when"
12195,SECT. V.,"Jupiter calls Minerva or Diana φίλον τέκος[620], and Venus τέκνον"
12196,SECT. V.,"ἐμόν[621]: again, in the care taken of Venus after she is wounded by"
12197,SECT. V.,"her mother Dione[622], and, more slightly indicated, in that of Diana"
12198,SECT. V.,"by Latona[623]. In the conduct of Mars on the death of Ascalaphus,"
12199,SECT. V.,"the impulse is momentary, and it has a strong animal tinge which"
12200,SECT. V.,"seems to overpower, like a fit of drunkenness, the little reason that"
12201,SECT. V.,he possesses. The grief of Jupiter for Sarpedon is the only case
12202,SECT. V.,"of an intense affection among the Immortals. And it is remarkable,"
12203,SECT. V.,"that this is felt towards, not a brother or sister divinity, but a"

12216,SECT. V.,
12217,SECT. V.,"The general principles of government, then, among the Immortals"
12218,SECT. V.,"themselves are simply those of force and terror, on the one hand, or"
12219,SECT. V.,"fraud and wheedling on the other. For example, Terror subdues the"
12220,SECT. V.,"adverse will of Juno[624] in the First Book, of Juno and Minerva in the"
12221,SECT. V.,"Eighth[625], and of Neptune, not without much reluctance on his part,"
12222,SECT. V.,in the Fifteenth. Thetis wheedles Jupiter in the First Book[626]; Juno
12223,SECT. V.,"entirely beguiles him, besides outwitting Venus, in the Fourteenth;"
12224,SECT. V.,"Minerva entraps Apollo in the Seventh into the plan of a single combat,"
12225,SECT. V.,which saves the Greeks from an impending defeat. And the difference
12226,SECT. V.,of opinion respecting Troy in the divine Assembly does not at the
12227,SECT. V.,"last come to effect without a contest of main strength, although the"
12228,SECT. V.,"virtual decision of the Olympian body had long ago been taken. Nay,"
12229,SECT. V.,"these principles of force and fraud are the real principles of action,"
12230,SECT. V.,even when not altogether on the surface. When Mercury declines battle
12231,SECT. V.,"with Latona, it is because he fears the consequences of a contest with"
12232,SECT. V.,"a wife of Jupiter[627]. In a manner still more curious, when Apollo"
12233,SECT. V.,"has declined battle with Neptune, professedly on the ground that it is"
12234,SECT. V.,not worth the while of deities to fight about the affairs of wretched
12235,SECT. V.,"mortals, the Poet explains his conduct by a sentiment partly of"
12236,SECT. V.,deference arising out of a relationship recognised among men:

12256,SECT. V.,As these moral elements had been almost wholly eliminated from the
12257,SECT. V.,general principles which govern the Homeric gods in their relations to
12258,SECT. V.,"one another, so likewise we look almost in vain for the traces of them"
12259,SECT. V.,"in their individual conduct. They observe, when acting for themselves,"
12260,SECT. V.,"neither courage, justice, nor prudence; but it is in regard to moral"
12261,SECT. V.,"temperance or self-control, that they fall furthest below the standard"
12262,SECT. V.,even of human virtue. The Mahometan heaven of men was the heaven of
12263,SECT. V.,"the Homeric gods. Their standing employment, except when troubled by"
12264,SECT. V.,"human affairs, is simply in perpetual, though not drunken or brutal,"
12265,SECT. V.,"feasting; sometimes in grosser indulgences. If, says Vulcan to his"
12266,SECT. V.,"mother, you quarrel about mortals, it will be a pestilent business,"
12267,SECT. V.,for there will be no pleasure in our banquets[629]. If Neptune in the
12268,SECT. V.,"Odyssey is gone among the Ethiopians[630], it is for a hecatomb of"
12269,SECT. V.,bulls and lambs. If Jupiter and all the gods make a journey to the same
12270,SECT. V.,"quarter in the Iliad, it is for a feast[631], which apparently was to"
12271,SECT. V.,last for eleven days. If Hercules has earned the reward of his labours
12272,SECT. V.,"by being taken up to heaven, his life there is described as a life"
12273,SECT. V.,entitling him to enjoy banquets among the Immortals[632]. If Ganymede
12274,SECT. V.,"is received into their company, it is that he may discharge for Jupiter"
12275,SECT. V.,"the duty of cup-bearer[633], in which it would appear that both Vulcan"
12276,SECT. V.,and Hebe were likewise employed. Of all the phrases characteristic of
12277,SECT. V.,"the Homeric gods and their life, there is none that sits better than"

12295,SECT. V.,"high enthusiastic emotions, which do so much to ennoble the human life"

12312,SECT. V.,"The Greek mythology, departing from the very basis of the Divine idea"
12313,SECT. V.,"in the conception of its gods, converts them, by a moral necessity, not"
12314,SECT. V.,"into man, but into something which is morally beneath man. There is not"
12315,SECT. V.,among all the deities what we can call one full unbroken development of
12316,SECT. V.,"noble character. They are, as a general rule, except so far as they are"
12317,SECT. V.,"modified by the traditive element, Titanic creations of intellect or"
12318,SECT. V.,"power, or both, without virtue. Even where, as in the cases of Minerva"
12319,SECT. V.,"and Diana, they are pure, their purity does not inspire or impress"
12320,SECT. V.,the Poet with half the force and fire which he must have felt when
12321,SECT. V.,"he drew the matron Andromache, or the maid Nausicaa. But this is not"
12322,SECT. V.,"the common case. With great reservation indeed as to the traditional,"
12323,SECT. V.,"in comparison with the mythical divinities, and likewise as to the"
12324,SECT. V.,"female deities, in comparison with the gods, we must admit that, as a"
12325,SECT. V.,"general rule, the Immortals of Homer, when brought to the bar of a"
12326,SECT. V.,"cool inquiry, are in their own personal conduct impure voluptuaries,"
12327,SECT. V.,"and that the laws, which formed the basis of family life, and which in"

12348,SECT. V.,~_Cruelty of Calypso in her love._~
12349,SECT. V.,
12350,SECT. V.,We may take Calypso as no unfair specimen of the ethics of the
12351,SECT. V.,"Immortals. In the hope of sensual pleasure, she keeps Ulysses a"
12352,SECT. V.,prisoner in her far island. She sees him pining in wretchedness for his
12353,SECT. V.,home and family from day to day; and well knows the distress that his
12354,SECT. V.,"absence must cause to a virtuous wife and son, as well as the public"
12355,SECT. V.,"evils, sure to arise from the prolonged absence of a wise and able"
12356,SECT. V.,"sovereign. Yet she never relents, but still in her odorous cavern she"
12357,SECT. V.,sings to the movement of her golden distaff. (Od. v. 59.) When Hermes
12358,SECT. V.,"makes known to her the decree that she cannot resist for his return,"
12359,SECT. V.,"she complains of the cruelty of the upper gods, but adds, ‘as I cannot"
12360,SECT. V.,"help myself, let him perish if Zeus will.’ She promises, however, to"
12361,SECT. V.,"send him off in safety, and keeps her word; but it is when she has"
12362,SECT. V.,"been well warned by Mercury of the consequences of disobedience, and"
12363,SECT. V.,firmly bound by Ulysses with the oath which was terrible even to the
12364,SECT. V.,"Immortals. (Od. v. 146, 184.)"
12365,SECT. V.,
12366,SECT. V.,"The sentiment of envy, which they had begun to entertain towards men,"
12367,SECT. V.,appears also to have been felt towards members of the divine order. It
12368,SECT. V.,was envy with which the gods viewed the happiness enjoyed by Aurora
12369,SECT. V.,"in her union with Orion, till it ended with his death; and that moved"
12370,SECT. V.,"Jupiter to destroy Iasion, the object of the choice of Demeter[638]."
12371,SECT. V.,But this (so says Calypso) was envy of the male towards the female
12372,SECT. V.,deities. There is no reciprocal sentiment: and it is curious here to
12373,SECT. V.,"observe the inequality of the sexes, together with so many other signs"
12374,SECT. V.,"and beginnings of corruption, established among the Immortals in a"
12375,SECT. V.,manner unknown to human society at the time.
12376,SECT. V.,
12377,SECT. V.,[638] Od. v. 118-29.
12378,SECT. V.,
12379,SECT. V.,Calypso may or may not be justified in the charge she makes against the
12380,SECT. V.,"gods; but, at least, it seems clear that, though they have some regard"
12381,SECT. V.,"to the prevalence of moral laws as between one man and another, they"
12382,SECT. V.,by no means impute any moral guilt to her in her cruel detention of
12383,SECT. V.,"Ulysses, even while they rectify a wrong by their decree."
12384,SECT. V.,
12385,SECT. V.,"The inferiority of the moral standard, which marks the order of gods,"
12386,SECT. V.,is likewise traceable in the various races which are described by
12387,SECT. V.,"Homer as claiming a special relationship to them; the Cyclopes, the"
12388,SECT. V.,"Læstrygonians, and even perhaps the Phæacians. Against the last of"
12389,SECT. V.,these we can certainly charge no more than an epicurean and inglorious
12390,SECT. V.,"ease: but the two former not only do not forfeit, they even prove,"
12391,SECT. V.,their relationship to the gods by being at once more strong and more
12392,SECT. V.,vicious than common men.
12393,SECT. V.,
12394,SECT. V.,"And, as it affects the kindred of the Immortals in common with"
12395,SECT. V.,"themselves, so also does it extend from the sphere of morals into that"
12396,SECT. V.,"of manners. While Hephæstus was ministering to them the festal cup,"
12397,SECT. V.,"they laughed ungovernably at his personal deformity[639]. Now, the"
12398,SECT. V.,"Greeks laugh at Thersites[640] when he has been beaten, but it is in"
12399,SECT. V.,"immediate connection with his misconduct, and it has nothing whatever"
12400,SECT. V.,to do with his ugliness. Laughter at mere deformity is nowhere found in
12401,SECT. V.,Homer: and would entirely jar with the tone of feeling that pervades
12402,SECT. V.,Homeric manners. The action that offers the nearest approach to it
12403,SECT. V.,confirms the spirit of this observation. It is the hurling of the stool
12404,SECT. V.,by the Suitor Antinous[641] at the apparently decrepit Ulysses; which
12405,SECT. V.,"is sternly registered, along with the other outrages of that depraved"
12406,SECT. V.,"company, for the coming day of retribution."

12417,SECT. V.,"of traditive origin, who enter little into the general picture, but"
12418,SECT. V.,"have their own portraiture apart, there are to be found in Olympus,"
12419,SECT. V.,"as well as in the lower earth, the relations of degree in power and"
12420,SECT. V.,"intelligence; and the gods with whom it is peopled, on the whole,"
12421,SECT. V.,possess it in large measure; but the law and purpose of their life
12422,SECT. V.,is summed up in self-will and self-indulgence. They do not debate
12423,SECT. V.,"their own duties, or even those of men, to one another: rarely, if"
12424,SECT. V.,"ever, those of men even towards themselves, except with reference to"
12425,SECT. V.,"the quantity of libation poured out, of flesh offered, and of steam"
12426,SECT. V.,reeking from the altars. There is a mixture in their enjoyments: some
12427,SECT. V.,"are refined, others sensual, but both are alike selfish, and the latter"
12428,SECT. V.,"are wholly unrestrained. It is said by Heyne, and with much of literal"
12429,SECT. V.,"truth, that the description of the day’s employment in Olympus, which"
12430,SECT. V.,"the first Iliad supplies, is a transcript of hero-life[642]; but it"
12431,SECT. V.,is of one part of hero-life only; it is of hero-life in its moments
12432,SECT. V.,"of indulgence and relaxation, which exhibit to us its lower and less"
12433,SECT. V.,"noble side, without any view of its great sentiments and great duties,"
12434,SECT. V.,"its sense of honour, its fine feeling, its reciprocal affections"
12435,SECT. V.,"as developed in the relations of consanguinity and affinity, of"
12436,SECT. V.,"friendship, of guestship, of sovereign and subject, and even of master"
12437,SECT. V.,"and serf. What a wretched spectacle would Hector, Achilles, Diomed,"
12438,SECT. V.,"Nestor, Ulysses, and the rest present to us, were their existence"
12439,SECT. V.,devoted simply to quaffing goblets and scenting or devouring the
12440,SECT. V.,"flesh of slain animals, even though with this there were present the"
12441,SECT. V.,mitigating refinement of perpetual harp and song. And yet such is the
12442,SECT. V.,picture offered by the Homeric mythology.

12445,SECT. V.,
12446,SECT. V.,"Upon the whole, while it remains true that the deification of heroes,"
12447,SECT. V.,"or their promotion to a happy immortality, in Homer’s time, depended"
12448,SECT. V.,upon virtue and merit; those who thus obtained admission to Olympus
12449,SECT. V.,"really found themselves introduced to a new and far lower law of life,"
12450,SECT. V.,"upon taking their places there, than that to which they had been"
12451,SECT. V.,"accustomed upon earth. Thus, for example, it is with Hercules; he has"
12452,SECT. V.,indeed a reward beyond the grave; but it consists simply in a life
12453,SECT. V.,"divested of the virtues of patience, obedience, valour, and struggle"
12454,SECT. V.,by which it had itself been earned.
12455,SECT. V.,
12456,SECT. V.,"The superiority, however, of the intellectual over the material"
12457,SECT. V.,"element, except in the matter of self-indulgence, is, as we might"
12458,SECT. V.,"have expected, decisively maintained in the Grecian mythology. It"
12459,SECT. V.,"is exhibited most clearly, perhaps, in the triumph of Jupiter and"
12460,SECT. V.,"Olympus over the brute might of the Titans. It is also palpable, when"
12461,SECT. V.,"we find that the strength of Mars, who represents nothing except"
12462,SECT. V.,"fighting force, does not always insure his victory, even in contests"
12463,SECT. V.,"of mere strength, but that he is overthrown by Minerva in the battle"
12464,SECT. V.,"of the gods, corrected at will by her on all other occasions[643], and"
12465,SECT. V.,"wounded, with her aid, by the hero Diomed beneath the walls of Troy."
12466,SECT. V.,"But when we speak of intellect as opposed to matter, the case stands so"
12467,SECT. V.,"differently with respect to different deities, that it is necessary to"

12474,SECT. V.,
12475,SECT. V.,The great and perhaps only essential property by which the Homeric gods
12476,SECT. V.,"are distinguished, is that expressed in their very common appellation"
12477,SECT. V.,of ἀθάνατος: they are immortal.
12478,SECT. V.,
12479,SECT. V.,"There is something curious in the question, why it is that they are"
12480,SECT. V.,"endowed uniformly and absolutely with this gift, but not with others;"
12481,SECT. V.,"why the limitation of Death is removed from them, and yet other"
12482,SECT. V.,limitations are allowed in so many respects to remain.
12483,SECT. V.,
12484,SECT. V.,It seems as if we had here an independent and impartial testimony to
12485,SECT. V.,"the truth of the representation conveyed in Holy Writ, that death has"
12486,SECT. V.,been the specific punishment ordained for sin: and that therefore in
12487,SECT. V.,"passing beyond the human order we, as a matter of course, pass beyond"
12488,SECT. V.,its range.
12489,SECT. V.,
12490,SECT. V.,Had the preternatural system of the Poet exhibited to us only such
12491,SECT. V.,"divinities as are the representatives of primeval tradition, it would"
12492,SECT. V.,have been easy to account for the attribute of immortality. But here
12493,SECT. V.,"are a multitude of deities, the creatures of human invention; why"
12494,SECT. V.,"was this gift bestowed on them, when others were withheld? It may"
12495,SECT. V.,"be, again, because that which came last into man’s condition should,"
12496,SECT. V.,"in the logical and moral order, go first out of it: that in framing"
12497,SECT. V.,"the conception of an existence higher than that of man, the first"
12498,SECT. V.,"step properly was, before dealing with the more positive faults or"
12499,SECT. V.,"imperfections inherent in his nature, to set aside that which did not"
12500,SECT. V.,"belong to it, but had been set upon it as a note of shame for a special"
12501,SECT. V.,"cause, like letters branded on a deserter or a slave."
12502,SECT. V.,
12503,SECT. V.,"In Homer it appears that every deity, great and small alike, is exempt"
12504,SECT. V.,from death. A Fragment of Hesiod[644] proceeds on a basis abstractedly
12505,SECT. V.,"different, and by an ingenious multiplication, from the term assigned"
12506,SECT. V.,"to man upwards, ascribes to the Nymphs a life of 291,600 years. In"
12507,SECT. V.,all likelihood the meaning of this passage may be not to curtail
12508,SECT. V.,"immortality, but to enlarge the practical conception of it, by carrying"
12509,SECT. V.,life up to a number which would impress the minds of a generation
12510,SECT. V.,"rude in arithmetic far more, than a merely abstract assertion of"
12511,SECT. V.,"immortality: just as to us the sand of the sea, or even the hairs of"
12512,SECT. V.,"the head, may more impressively convey the idea of unlimited numbers"
12513,SECT. V.,"than does the phrase innumerable, although in reality the effect of"

12574,SECT. V.,"and to individual cases, has this one feature applying to it as a"
12575,SECT. V.,"whole, that it is a position of preference, not of independence."
12576,SECT. V.,
12577,SECT. V.,Every deity has some extension of personal liberties and powers beyond
12578,SECT. V.,what men enjoy. But it is in general such as we should conceive to be
12579,SECT. V.,"rather characteristic of intermediate orders of creation, than properly"
12580,SECT. V.,attaching to the divine nature. We must however distinguish between
12581,SECT. V.,these three things: 1. The personal exemptions of a divinity from the
12582,SECT. V.,"restraints of time and place, and other limiting conditions; 2. The"
12583,SECT. V.,"general powers capable of being exercised over other gods, over man,"
12584,SECT. V.,over animal or inanimate nature; 3. The powers enjoyed within the
12585,SECT. V.,particular province over which a divinity presides.
12586,SECT. V.,
12587,SECT. V.,"Thus for example Calypso, though, as we have seen she is of inferior"

12589,SECT. V.,"favourable breeze: and she predicts calamity, which is to smite him"
12590,SECT. V.,"before he reaches his home. Circe transforms men into beasts, and then"
12591,SECT. V.,restores them to forms of greater beauty and stature[649]. She is
12592,SECT. V.,"cognizant of events in the world beneath, and of what will occur on the"
12593,SECT. V.,arrival of Ulysses there. She then sends a favourable breeze to impel
12594,SECT. V.,his vessel[650]; and on his return predicts to him the circumstances
12595,SECT. V.,of his homeward voyage[651]. And Proteus delivers a similar prediction
12596,SECT. V.,"to Menelaus, to which he adds a declaration of his destiny after"
12597,SECT. V.,death[652]: he also converts himself into a multitude of forms.

12631,SECT. V.,
12632,SECT. V.,"The great powers of these secondary deities may be accounted for, I"
12633,SECT. V.,"think, by two considerations:"
12634,SECT. V.,
12635,SECT. V.,1. These divinities belong to the circle of outer or Phœnician
12636,SECT. V.,"traditions, and the Poet is not therefore, in treating them, subject"
12637,SECT. V.,to the same laws as those by which he regulates the Olympian order.
12638,SECT. V.,"They are brought upon the stage with reference to Ulysses or Menelaus,"
12639,SECT. V.,and in the Wanderings only; thus they are adopted by Homer for this
12640,SECT. V.,"special purpose, and endowed with whatever gifts they require for it,"
12641,SECT. V.,"just as strangers, while they remain, are treated more liberally in a"
12642,SECT. V.,"house than the children of the family, for the very reason that they"
12643,SECT. V.,"are strangers, and have no concern with the regular organization and"
12644,SECT. V.,continuing life of the household.
12645,SECT. V.,
12646,SECT. V.,2. Another principle of the mythology conducts us by another road to
12647,SECT. V.,the same end. Every deity is liberally endowed within his own province.
12648,SECT. V.,"Now the province of Proteus, Calypso, and Circe, is the Outer sphere"
12649,SECT. V.,"of Geography. Within the range of that sphere, the ordinary agency"
12650,SECT. V.,of the Olympian deities individually is suspended. Homer prefers to
12651,SECT. V.,"leave it to be governed by the divinities, whom he can frame out of"
12652,SECT. V.,his Phœnician materials for the purpose. In this way he is enabled to
12653,SECT. V.,"enlarge the circle of variety, and to draw new and salient lines of"
12654,SECT. V.,distinction between the two worlds. Neptune indeed is there perforce;
12655,SECT. V.,"for navigation is the staple of its theme, and the θάλασσα pervades"
12656,SECT. V.,"it, from no portion of which can he possibly be excluded. The Olympian"
12657,SECT. V.,"Court, too, oversee it, and their orders are conveyed thither by"
12658,SECT. V.,"Mercury their agent. But, except Neptune for the reason given, the"
12659,SECT. V.,"ordinary action of the deities individually is suspended[656], not"
12660,SECT. V.,"on account of any limitation of power, for instance in Minerva, but"
12661,SECT. V.,"for a poetical purpose, and with the excuse, that the whole sphere is"
12662,SECT. V.,"removed beyond common life and experience. Hence, just as Vulcan works"
12663,SECT. V.,"professionally the most extraordinary miracles, though he is but a"
12664,SECT. V.,"secondary deity, because they are in the domain of metallic art, so"
12665,SECT. V.,Circe and the rest are empowered to do the like within a domain of
12666,SECT. V.,which they are the rooted zoophytes and exclusive occupants.

12674,SECT. V.,Venus is among gods what Nireus was among men: ἄναλκις ἔην θεός[657].

12676,SECT. V.,express record of her girdle as invincible in its operation[659].
12677,SECT. V.,The case of Mars is peculiar: for he is brought upon the stage to be
12678,SECT. V.,"beaten in his own province, as the exigencies of the poem require"
12679,SECT. V.,"it: but inferior, nay pitiful, as he is in every point of mind and"
12680,SECT. V.,"character, yet as to imposing personal appearance, he is made to"
12681,SECT. V.,"take rank in a comparison with Jupiter and Neptune, between whose"
12682,SECT. V.,"names his is placed[660]. Neptune exhibits vast power, and on his"
12683,SECT. V.,"own domain, the sea, appears even to have an inkling of providential"
12684,SECT. V.,foreknowledge[661]: he is conscious that Ulysses will reach Scheria.
12685,SECT. V.,"Except upon the sea, he exhibits no such attributes of intelligence,"
12686,SECT. V.,"though he always remains possessed of huge force. Mercury, again,"
12687,SECT. V.,"shows in locomotion a greater independence of the laws of place, than"
12688,SECT. V.,some deities who are of a rank higher than his own: and doubtless it
12689,SECT. V.,is because he is professionally an agent or messenger. Even so the

12783,SECT. V.,"here, without special directions, in the zone of the Outer Geography,"
12784,SECT. V.,"we have no means of measuring the terrestrial distance with precision,"
12785,SECT. V.,and the Poet has not informed us what interval of space he intended us
12786,SECT. V.,to suppose.
12787,SECT. V.,
12788,SECT. V.,The inventive deities of the second order in Olympus are very slightly
12789,SECT. V.,gifted in this matter. So much we perceive from the ignorance of Mars
12790,SECT. V.,"about the death of his son Ascalaphus. When Venus observes, that Æneas"
12791,SECT. V.,"has been wounded, Homer does not name the spot from which she looked;"
12792,SECT. V.,"but the general range of the powers of this divinity is so narrow, that"

12798,SECT. V.,freely into the anomalous character of the head of Olympus. In the
12799,SECT. V.,"First Iliad, Thetis explains to her son that she cannot introduce to"
12800,SECT. V.,"Jupiter the matter of his wrongs, until he returns from the country of"
12801,SECT. V.,"the Ethiopians, whither he has repaired with the other Immortals to a"
12802,SECT. V.,banquet[671]. This may mean either that he is too far off to attend

12804,SECT. V.,odours of a hecatomb.

12809,SECT. V.,"a general and pervading law of restraint, are evident in the"
12810,SECT. V.,descriptions of the deities with respect to their powers of locomotion.
12811,SECT. V.,Facility of movement accrues to them variously according to 1. their
12812,SECT. V.,peculiar work and office; 2. their general dignity and freedom from
12813,SECT. V.,merely mythological traits; 3. the exigencies of the particular
12814,SECT. V.,"situation. As to the first, I have noticed that Mercury and Iris have"
12815,SECT. V.,"a rapidity as messenger-gods, which in their simple capacity as gods"
12816,SECT. V.,they could scarcely possess. Yet even Mercury follows a route: from
12817,SECT. V.,"Olympus he strikes across Pieria, and next descending skims the surface"
12818,SECT. V.,"of the sea; then at length passes to the beach of the island, and so"
12819,SECT. V.,"onwards to the cave of the Nymph[672]. Minerva, on the other hand,"
12820,SECT. V.,"in virtue not of any special function, but of her general power and"
12821,SECT. V.,"grandeur, is conceived as swifter still. The journeys of Apollo, in"
12822,SECT. V.,"like manner, are conceived of as instantaneous: the rule in both cases"
12823,SECT. V.,being subject to poetical exceptions only. The chariots of Juno and of
12824,SECT. V.,"Neptune[673], again, proceed with measured pace. Each step of Juno’s"
12825,SECT. V.,horses covers the distance over which a man can see[674]. Neptune
12826,SECT. V.,himself passes in four steps from Samothrace to Ægæ[675]. The driving
12827,SECT. V.,of Jupiter from Olympus to Ida is described in terms before used for
12828,SECT. V.,Juno’s journey[676]. Juno travels at another time from Olympus to
12829,SECT. V.,"Lemnos by Pieria, Emathia, and the tops of the Thracian mountains. Here"
12830,SECT. V.,Homer seems to supply her with a sort of made road on which to tread:
12831,SECT. V.,"for the route is a little circuitous[677]. Mars, when wounded, takes"
12832,SECT. V.,"wing to Olympus: but Venus, though only hurt in the wrist, cannot get"
12833,SECT. V.,"thither until she obtains the aid of his chariot, which happily for her"

12851,SECT. V.,"whole subject of Olympian locomotion, and makes it difficult to"
12852,SECT. V.,draw with rigour the proper mythological conclusions. This may be
12853,SECT. V.,sufficiently illustrated by the following cases. We have seen the
12854,SECT. V.,"majestic march of Juno from one hill top to another, and the measured"
12855,SECT. V.,"though speedy course of her chariot. Yet, under the pressure of"
12856,SECT. V.,"urgent considerations, she flies from Ida to Olympus, as the bearer"
12857,SECT. V.,"of Jupiter’s message, with a rapidity that Homer illustrates by the"
12858,SECT. V.,"remarkable simile of the travelling of Thought[679]. Again, where an"
12859,SECT. V.,"imposing magnificence is the object, measure is introduced into the"
12860,SECT. V.,movement of Apollo himself by the clang of the darts upon his shoulder
12861,SECT. V.,"as he goes[680]. And, even more, Venus, whom we have seen so impotent"
12862,SECT. V.,"on the field of Troy, after her exposure in the Eighth Odyssey, flies"
12863,SECT. V.,at once all the way to Paphos; as does Mars to Thrace[681]. This in
12864,SECT. V.,both cases is probably because the occasion did not admit of ornamental
12865,SECT. V.,"enlargements, such as befitted the journey of a god. And when Vulcan is"
12866,SECT. V.,represented as actually engaged in falling during the whole day from
12867,SECT. V.,"Olympus down into Lemnus[682], a poetical allusion to his lameness may"
12868,SECT. V.,probably be intended.

12960,SECT. V.,evidently treats the passion simply as an instrument for political
12961,SECT. V.,ends. Of this Homer has given us a very remarkable indication. For
12962,SECT. V.,"when she sees Jupiter on Ida, though she is just then conceiving her"

12967,SECT. V.,"impersonations, not yet endowed with the strong human individuality"
12968,SECT. V.,"of the Greek Olympus, such as Themis and Helios, we do not expect to"

12984,SECT. V.,There is also in the deities of Homer not merely a dependance upon

12986,SECT. V.,The basis of this idea is laid in the conception which made feasting
12987,SECT. V.,the normal occupation of Olympus. It followed that they were not
12988,SECT. V.,"only bound by something in the nature of necessity to food, but also"

12996,SECT. V.,"unjust that they visit with wrath. But when he carries us into Olympus,"
12997,SECT. V.,"and we behold them in the living energy of their individualities, it"
12998,SECT. V.,"is sacrifice which they want, and which forms their share in the fruits"

13011,SECT. V.,Moral retribution in Homer lags and limps at a great distance behind

13013,SECT. V.,"once. Again, in the case of Troy, liberality in this particular even"
13014,SECT. V.,seems to create a party in Olympus on behalf of an offending race. On
13015,SECT. V.,"the erection of the rampart by the Greeks, Neptune immediately urges"
13016,SECT. V.,the omission of the regular hecatombs against them. It is punished by
13017,SECT. V.,"Diana in Ætolia, by the gods generally on the departure from Troas; and"

13022,SECT. V.,"The reason of this preeminence of sacrifices, both as to punishment"

13024,SECT. V.,"we shall presently see, the practice had its moral side also) to"
13025,SECT. V.,"substitute positive observances for moral obedience; but partly,"
13026,SECT. V.,"likewise, in the importance of sacrifices to the anthropophuism of the"

13032,SECT. V.,"suggestion to the mind of Agamemnon[696], and gives, with Minerva,"
13033,SECT. V.,"courage to a warrior; but this is the whole of her immediate action,"
13034,SECT. V.,"I mean action without a mean, in this department, exhibited by any"

13047,SECT. V.,
13048,SECT. V.,"Among the deities of invention, the general rule is, with respect"

13050,SECT. V.,is confined to matters in immediate connection with their several
13051,SECT. V.,"specialties. Two extraordinary acts of power over nature appear,"
13052,SECT. V.,"however, to be within the competency of them all. One is the production"
13053,SECT. V.,of a patch of cloud or vapour at will; the other is that of assuming
13054,SECT. V.,"the human form for themselves, either generally or in the likeness of"
13055,SECT. V.,"some particular person. I do not, however, recollect any instance in"
13056,SECT. V.,which this power is exercised by a deity of invention in the manner
13057,SECT. V.,"in which Minerva employs it in the First Iliad[697], that is, under"
13058,SECT. V.,the condition of being visible only to one person out of many who are
13059,SECT. V.,"present. In that image we seem to find a figure, perhaps a traditionary"
13060,SECT. V.,"remnant, of that inward and personal communication between the Almighty"
13061,SECT. V.,"and the individual soul, which constitutes a high distinguishing note"

13066,SECT. V.,There would appear to have been certain visible marks which went to
13067,SECT. V.,"distinguish a god, up to a certain point, from men. Hector in the"
13068,SECT. V.,"Fifteenth Iliad knows Apollo to be a god[698], but does not know what"
13069,SECT. V.,"god. Minerva clears the vision of Diomed, that he may be able to"
13070,SECT. V.,"discriminate between gods and men[699]. Pandarus, eyeing Diomed, is"
13071,SECT. V.,uncertain whether he is a mortal or a god[700]. The recognition of
13072,SECT. V.,"Venus by Helen may, indeed, have been due to the imperfectness of her"
13073,SECT. V.,power of self-transformation[701]; but it may also have been owing

13102,SECT. V.,
13103,SECT. V.,I think that references of this kind in Holy Scripture usually bear

13114,SECT. V.,"the Poet has given us, of the head and nod, meaning the decree of"
13115,SECT. V.,Jupiter. For all these allusions are capable of explanation on the same

13275,SECT. V.,"There is, however, I think, another reason, besides feebleness in his"

13277,SECT. V.,them as omnipotent in regard to the operations of the human mind; and
13278,SECT. V.,"that is, his profound sense of the free agency of man. This principle"
13279,SECT. V.,"with him, as it were, confronts the deity on every side; who respects"
13280,SECT. V.,"its dignity, and never really invades its sphere, but pursues his work"
13281,SECT. V.,by means compatible with its essential character. The idea of the deity
13282,SECT. V.,"pervading the poems is mainly that of a cooperative power, who helps"
13283,SECT. V.,us when and as we help ourselves. It is expressed with an unrivalled
13284,SECT. V.,"simplicity when Telemachus, coming as a young man into the presence of"
13285,SECT. V.,"Nestor, feels oppressed with a nervous shyness; and Minerva encourages"
13286,SECT. V.,"him by telling him that he can of himself find something to say, and"

13311,SECT. V.,"called, that, except within the limits of their particular domain or"

13317,SECT. V.,
13318,SECT. V.,While therefore the strength of the Olympian deities lies in knowledge
13319,SECT. V.,"and in power, we find upon the whole that even in these particularly"
13320,SECT. V.,they are subject to manifold limitation. They could translate mortals
13321,SECT. V.,"out of this world in which the rule of Death prevails, as we see in"

13324,SECT. V.,"they could either raise men from the grave, prevent their dying in"
13325,SECT. V.,"the course of nature, heal their wounds or diseases, or set their"
13326,SECT. V.,"broken limbs. When even Latona and Diana heal Æneas[712], they do it"

13385,SECT. VI.,"state of religious sentiment and obligation, and of the moral law,"

13394,SECT. VI.,"as to form a centre either for national union, or for the life of"
13395,SECT. VI.,"the individual. Had there been such an observance, we must, without"

13513,SECT. VI.,upon them; then they are regarded for a time with depraved admiration;

13515,SECT. VI.,the small.
13516,SECT. VI.,
13517,SECT. VI.,It was hardly possible that men could be effectually swayed for
13518,SECT. VI.,"a length of time by the moral government of deities, themselves"
13519,SECT. VI.,privileged by human invention for unbounded immorality: but it was
13520,SECT. VI.,naturally the first stage of the destructive process to vitiate the
13521,SECT. VI.,"character of the gods, and the next and later one to break down the"
13522,SECT. VI.,"credit of their administration of human affairs, which only became"
13523,SECT. VI.,incredible even to the enlightened part of the community after their
13524,SECT. VI.,moral worthlessness had been fully and long developed.
13525,SECT. VI.,
13526,SECT. VI.,The Homeric poems expose to our view two standards not mutually
13527,SECT. VI.,"accordant, the objective and the subjective. If we pay attention to"
13528,SECT. VI.,"the impressions current among men respecting the gods, they are the"
13529,SECT. VI.,guardians of some moral and social principles of the highest order.
13530,SECT. VI.,"But if we take their own word for it, the mere Olympian deities seem"
13531,SECT. VI.,"ordinarily to appreciate no quality or conduct, except the practice"
13532,SECT. VI.,"of offering up numerous and well fed animals in sacrifice, each with"
13533,SECT. VI.,the accompanying tribute of the appointed portion; that so they may
13534,SECT. VI.,"draw, not a moral but a physical, though a comparatively refined,"
13535,SECT. VI.,gratification from the savour and the taste[728].

13540,SECT. VI.,"not only given on selfish principles, but is liable to be withdrawn"
13541,SECT. VI.,for causes wholly independent of his deserts. Quarrels about men
13542,SECT. VI.,"are settled, not by each foregoing his animosities, but by each"
13543,SECT. VI.,surrendering and abandoning his clients. ‘I will give up Troy to
13544,SECT. VI.,"you,’ says Jupiter; ‘but mind that I shall be at liberty to destroy"
13545,SECT. VI.,"the cities which you love, when I may be so minded[729].’ ‘You are"
13546,SECT. VI.,"quite welcome,’ answers Juno, ‘and indeed I could not prevent you: but"
13547,SECT. VI.,"let me have Troy destroyed.’ Why, says even Apollo to Neptune, should"
13548,SECT. VI.,we quarrel about miserable mortals? It is not worth our while: let us
13549,SECT. VI.,leave them to themselves[730]. No Homeric deity ever will be found to
13550,SECT. VI.,make a personal sacrifice on behalf of a human client.

13557,SECT. VI.,"sacrifice was not so entirely disconnected from morality, as we are"
13558,SECT. VI.,"perhaps too apt to suppose. I think we may, on the contrary, find in it"
13559,SECT. VI.,at least a witness to the essential harmony between morality and divine
13560,SECT. VI.,"worship, and to the difficulty of tearing them asunder."
13561,SECT. VI.,
13562,SECT. VI.,"We are here met, indeed, by the case of Autolycus, which proves to us"
13563,SECT. VI.,that the better elements of this practice were already on their way
13564,SECT. VI.,"to corruption, inasmuch as in that instance they had reached it. It"
13565,SECT. VI.,"was a case, let it be remembered, of sacrifices, not to the gods in"
13566,SECT. VI.,"general, nor to the higher or the better deities, but to Mercury, a"
13567,SECT. VI.,"purely mythical divinity; and therefore what we see in it is, a false"
13568,SECT. VI.,religion in a state of ripeness at one particular point. Now the
13569,SECT. VI.,"worship of Mercury, the god of gain, was perhaps the first point at"
13570,SECT. VI.,which the morality of the system might be expected to give way: and
13571,SECT. VI.,it is therefore quite in the natural course that a case like that of
13572,SECT. VI.,Autolycus should be presented to us without any corresponding case for
13573,SECT. VI.,"any other deity[731]. As it stands in Homer, it represents what was"
13574,SECT. VI.,"then the exception, though it was gradually to become the rule."

13619,SECT. VI.,"1. In general, they regard virtue and obedience with approbation."

13622,SECT. VI.,it.
13623,SECT. VI.,
13624,SECT. VI.,"3. But they also observe any excess, or marked continuity, of good"

13626,SECT. VI.,"permit the human race, on any conditions, to attain to a prosperity or"
13627,SECT. VI.,abundance which should have any semblance of rivalling their own.
13628,SECT. VI.,
13629,SECT. VI.,"As respects the first, it is indeed a pale and feeble sentiment; but"
13630,SECT. VI.,still it exists. They listen readily to those who obey them[734].
13631,SECT. VI.,"Prayer appeases them, as well as sacrifice[735]. They love not"
13632,SECT. VI.,"perverse deeds like those of the Suitors, but they honour justice and"
13633,SECT. VI.,"righteousness[736]. Upon the whole it may be observed, that much more"
13634,SECT. VI.,"just and elevated sentiments are predicated of the gods as a body, than"
13635,SECT. VI.,when they appear as individuals. For it is as a body that they still

13647,SECT. VI.,"view iniquity with a sentiment sometimes called by Homer ὄπις, an"
13648,SECT. VI.,after-regard that remembers and avenges it. For this ὄπις the wicked
13649,SECT. VI.,"do not care[738], and such indifference is a chief sign of their"

13719,SECT. VI.,"though not always, to prosper in the end: let us take, for example,"
13720,SECT. VI.,"Nestor, Menelaus, or Ulysses. Ajax and Agamemnon meet unhappy ends;"
13721,SECT. VI.,"but Ajax was stern and sullen, while Agamemnon cannot be acquitted of"
13722,SECT. VI.,"cupidity and selfishness. On the other hand, as punishers of wrong,"
13723,SECT. VI.,the gods of Olympus do not visit all wrongs and all vices alike.
13724,SECT. VI.,"Especially they take little notice, in their moral government as in"
13725,SECT. VI.,"their lives, of the law of purity: there is no express notice of their"
13726,SECT. VI.,"displeasure against the crime of Paris; and Jupiter, the guardian"
13727,SECT. VI.,"of the judgment seat, the friend of the suppliant, the stranger, and"
13728,SECT. VI.,"the poor, makes no pretension to defend the marriage bed from the"
13729,SECT. VI.,"contamination he had himself so often wrought. However, in a very"
13730,SECT. VI.,"aggravated instance, namely, that of Ægisthus, his adulterous marriage"
13731,SECT. VI.,"with Clytemnestra[748] is noticed explicitly in the Olympian Council,"
13732,SECT. VI.,as contributing to the enormity of his offence. But in such a case many
13733,SECT. VI.,"other elements, besides that of purity, are involved: the whole social"
13734,SECT. VI.,and political order of the world is at stake.

13736,SECT. VI.,[748] Od. i. 37-40.
13737,SECT. VI.,
13738,SECT. VI.,Thus upon the whole there was but little more in the sentiments than
13739,SECT. VI.,"in the conduct of the Immortals, to maintain among men a sense of"
13740,SECT. VI.,piety towards Heaven. Yet a good deal of authority and support were
13741,SECT. VI.,"lent to important principles of relative duty, by the belief that the"
13742,SECT. VI.,deities would or might avenge its infraction. We must in short fully
13743,SECT. VI.,"embrace the fact that man, as represented in Homer, was inconsistent"
13744,SECT. VI.,"with respect to his religion, in the sense opposite to that in which"
13745,SECT. VI.,inconsistency commonly affects that relation. He had more still
13746,SECT. VI.,"remaining in him of ancient and natural morality, than his belief could"
13747,SECT. VI.,"either adequately account for in theory, or permanently sustain in"
13748,SECT. VI.,action.
13749,SECT. VI.,
13750,SECT. VI.,"It should at the same time be borne in mind, that, while the vices"
13751,SECT. VI.,"of Olympus appertain to the individual deities, its obscure and"
13752,SECT. VI.,"qualified virtues, in the championship of duty, and the avenging of"
13753,SECT. VI.,"crime upon earth, are not the properties of this or that mythological"
13754,SECT. VI.,"impersonation, but either of the deities considered as a whole with"
13755,SECT. VI.,"one united will, or else of those among them in whose characters Homer"
13756,SECT. VI.,still enables us to read the vestiges of primitive tradition.

13758,SECT. VI.,~_Their course with respect to Troy._~
13759,SECT. VI.,
13760,SECT. VI.,"Saint Augustine observes[749], that some defenders of the Pagan"
13761,SECT. VI.,mythology in later times quoted the fall of Troy as an instance of
13762,SECT. VI.,Divine retribution coming upon the descendants of Laomedon for his
13763,SECT. VI.,"perjury, and some, to the same effect, as a punishment of the adultery"
13764,SECT. VI.,"committed by Paris. To which he replies truly, that the heathen deities"
13765,SECT. VI.,"had no right to punish in Paris an act which had the sanction of Venus,"
13766,SECT. VI.,"as she bore Æneas to Anchises, and of Mars as the father of Romulus:"
13767,SECT. VI.,Æneas and Romulus being the two great reputed fountain-heads of the
13768,SECT. VI.,highest Roman lineage.
13769,SECT. VI.,
13770,SECT. VI.,"[749] De Civ. Dei, iii. 3."
13771,SECT. VI.,
13772,SECT. VI.,"Now, though Homer has practically represented the gods as avenging the"
13773,SECT. VI.,"pollution of the nuptial bed, it may be observed that he nowhere seems"
13774,SECT. VI.,to put prominently forward the adultery of Paris as the main gist of
13775,SECT. VI.,"his offence. In fact, the idea of adultery is very much absorbed, as we"
13776,SECT. VI.,"shall see, according to the poems, in the act of violent abduction. The"
13777,SECT. VI.,"Greeks on their side, with the single exception of Menelaus himself,"
13778,SECT. VI.,"treat Paris as a robber, or else a coward; not as one who had, like"
13779,SECT. VI.,"Ægisthus with Clytemnestra, corrupted the wife of one of their princes."
13780,SECT. VI.,"And so Hector is, I think, not quite accurately criticized by Mure[750]"
13781,SECT. VI.,for failing to find fault with Paris on the ground of adultery. Hector
13782,SECT. VI.,does reproach his brother for having abused the friendly intercourse of
13783,SECT. VI.,"life to carry off another man’s wife, and then not having the courage"
13784,SECT. VI.,to meet the husband in the field. This seems to me in perfect keeping
13785,SECT. VI.,"with the ideas of the time, especially if I am right in the view, which"
13786,SECT. VI.,"I shall endeavour to sustain by argument, that Hector himself is not"
13787,SECT. VI.,"the elder, but the younger brother of the two. What did the Greeks"
13788,SECT. VI.,"aim at avenging? Not, we shall find, the wrong done to Menelaus in"
13789,SECT. VI.,"his conjugal character, but the sorrows and sufferings of Helen were"
13790,SECT. VI.,"evidently the prominent and conspicuous idea in the mind of the Poet,"
13791,SECT. VI.,"and in the mind, as he represents it, of the Greeks. So that, while"
13792,SECT. VI.,Menelaus himself is the only person who in the Iliad shows a resentment
13793,SECT. VI.,"of his own conjugal wrongs, the Greeks appear to think partly of Helen,"
13794,SECT. VI.,"partly of their nation’s honour, partly of their allegiance to the"
13795,SECT. VI.,"Pelopids; and partly, perhaps chiefly, of the booty which, in requital"
13796,SECT. VI.,"of their arduous labours, they are to gain upon the sack of Troy[751]."

13803,SECT. VI.,"The defence, therefore, of the heathen deities which St. Augustine"
13804,SECT. VI.,"notices as having been put forward, was a late afterthought. The Poet"
13805,SECT. VI.,appears indeed to treat the lustful effeminacy of Paris in general
13806,SECT. VI.,with a grave and marked contempt; but this is rather his own personal
13807,SECT. VI.,"sentiment, than a result directly connected with his religious belief"
13808,SECT. VI.,"or system. And, more at large, I do not find it clear that in any place"
13809,SECT. VI.,"of the Poems any deity appears, either as the guardian of purity, or as"
13810,SECT. VI.,the avenger of its infraction. Under these circumstances we shall have
13811,SECT. VI.,"the more cause to wonder, that that virtue could still have been held,"
13812,SECT. VI.,"as it was held, by Homer and the Greeks, in partial but evidently real"
13813,SECT. VI.,admiration.
13814,SECT. VI.,
13815,SECT. VI.,"Although retribution was limited to public and social sins, and did not"
13816,SECT. VI.,"touch the inner and finer parts of human conduct, it is not difficult"
13817,SECT. VI.,to trace the advantages which flowed from that sensible remainder of
13818,SECT. VI.,religion which still subsisted in the Heroic age; not from those parts
13819,SECT. VI.,"of the system which were due to human invention, but from the elements"
13820,SECT. VI.,"which it still contained of the ancient theism, and which invention had"
13821,SECT. VI.,not yet wholly smothered.

13834,SECT. VI.,"As between governors and governed, so between rich and poor. We cannot"
13835,SECT. VI.,doubt that the worthy Eumæus expresses the general sentiment of his
13836,SECT. VI.,"age, when, having been reproached by the haughty Suitor Antinous"
13837,SECT. VI.,"with having invited a beggar into the palace of Ulysses, he answers,"
13838,SECT. VI.,"not by denial, but by showing that the idea is self-condemned by its"
13839,SECT. VI.,"absurdity. Those indeed, he replies, may be solicited to come to a"
13840,SECT. VI.,"house who exercise the agreeable or the useful professions; the Seer,"

13850,SECT. VI.,"With this standard of sentiment, not peculiar to that age, except in"
13851,SECT. VI.,"the simple frankness with which it is avowed, it was surely of the"
13852,SECT. VI.,"utmost importance for the needy and afflicted, that they should be"

13862,SECT. VI.,And the standing distinction in the Odyssey between a virtuous

13873,SECT. VI.,
13874,SECT. VI.,"It was thus a clear fact in the heroic age, that religious belief was"
13875,SECT. VI.,a foundation and support to the exercise of charitable offices between
13876,SECT. VI.,"man and man. I think we may further assert, that it is a fact of all"
13877,SECT. VI.,time; that in all ages and countries the strength and liveliness of
13878,SECT. VI.,belief in God is a measure which determines the aggregate amount and
13879,SECT. VI.,"activity of mutual love. Hence, as the Olympian religion became more"
13880,SECT. VI.,"and more hollow, public oppression increased, and private charity"
13881,SECT. VI.,"and hospitality declined. Yet, even in its most corrupt and decrepit"
13882,SECT. VI.,"period, it was on the steps of temples that the congregations of"
13883,SECT. VI.,mendicants assembled; spontaneous and unconscious witnesses to the
13884,SECT. VI.,"fact that, next to God their Friend in heaven, the reflection of God,"
13885,SECT. VI.,"however faint, in the mind of man, is their best friend on earth. And"
13886,SECT. VI.,"of the many great social results of Christianity, one standing in the"
13887,SECT. VI.,"very foremost rank has been, that it has for the first time made the"
13888,SECT. VI.,"rights of the poor a social axiom, which, though it may in practice be"
13889,SECT. VI.,"evaded, none are hardy enough to deny. Perhaps the very strongest of"
13890,SECT. VI.,"all the proofs of the connection between religious belief, and duties"
13891,SECT. VI.,"to the needy, is to be found in the instinctive horror which is created"
13892,SECT. VI.,"in the minds of men, when a prominent profession of the first is"
13893,SECT. VI.,"accidentally and occasionally exhibited by persons, who show a palpable"
13894,SECT. VI.,disregard of the second.
13895,SECT. VI.,
13896,SECT. VI.,"Side by side with the powerful obligation, of the indeterminate"
13897,SECT. VI.,"species, which binds man to man in the name of charity or brotherly"
13898,SECT. VI.,"kindness, stands the corresponding determinate principle of truth"
13899,SECT. VI.,"and justice, which aims at preserving entire to each individual the"
13900,SECT. VI.,definite rights to which he is entitled.
13901,SECT. VI.,
13902,SECT. VI.,An important part of these definite rights belongs immediately to
13903,SECT. VI.,the relations between the private person and the civil power. But
13904,SECT. VI.,"the capacity of any human authority to do justice, even where the"
13905,SECT. VI.,"will cannot be found fault with, is of necessity defective: and no"
13906,SECT. VI.,"government can do its duties for a day, irrespective of the aid which"
13907,SECT. VI.,each private person renders to it in reference to every other. Nor is
13908,SECT. VI.,"this enough; it wants, and cannot dispense with, the assistance of an"
13909,SECT. VI.,"auxiliary within the breast, in order to guard itself against delusion,"
13910,SECT. VI.,"and to secure the requisite conformity between thought, word, and act."
13911,SECT. VI.,"In other words, the state wants an instrument by which to induce men to"
13912,SECT. VI.,speak the truth.
13913,SECT. VI.,
13914,SECT. VI.,"No such end can be reached by force. Force, in the shape of torture,"
13915,SECT. VI.,"will doubtless in the long run avail to make men asseverate that, be"
13916,SECT. VI.,"it what it may, by which they may obtain release from an intolerable"
13917,SECT. VI.,suffering. But the first effect of torture is to make the sufferer
13918,SECT. VI.,"indifferent to the truth or falsehood of his confessions, so he can but"
13919,SECT. VI.,"obtain relief by means of them. The second, and still more detrimental"
13920,SECT. VI.,"effect, must be to undermine the very basis of inward truthfulness, and"
13921,SECT. VI.,to create a mental habit of indifference as between what is true and

13932,SECT. VI.,"to the existence of a moral government in the world, even on this side"

13971,SECT. VI.,"short words describe the props of human society: they are, γάμος,"
13972,SECT. VI.,"ὅρκος, θέμις, θεός."
13973,SECT. VI.,
13974,SECT. VI.,"All these sanctions, however partial and remote, thus given to human"
13975,SECT. VI.,"duty by belief in the gods, could not but be of great practical value."
13976,SECT. VI.,
13977,SECT. VI.,"And indeed it may with truth be said, that the mere idea of the"
13978,SECT. VI.,presence of an overruling power in the world was of inestimable
13979,SECT. VI.,"advantage in repressing human passion, in moderating desire, and in"
13980,SECT. VI.,"limiting the excesses of caprice, wilfulness, and violence."
13981,SECT. VI.,
13982,SECT. VI.,But it is obvious that these beneficial results from belief in the
13983,SECT. VI.,"gods belonged not to the particular development, but to the theistical"
13984,SECT. VI.,principle which lay within and under it. The idea of a moral Governor
13985,SECT. VI.,"of the universe was, and ever will be, an unfailing seed of good"
13986,SECT. VI.,"wherever it may exist. The Pagan mythology, at every step of its"
13987,SECT. VI.,"unfolding into detail, enfeebled and degraded that great idea, but it"
13988,SECT. VI.,could not be destroyed all at once. _Nemo repente fuit turpissimus_;
13989,SECT. VI.,"and a system, like a man, requires time to reach the extreme of"
13990,SECT. VI.,"depravation. As, among men, a judge is not supposed to lose all regard"
13991,SECT. VI.,"for justice, because it may be that in some particular of private life"
13992,SECT. VI.,"he has transgressed, so the Olympian divinities might have credit"
13993,SECT. VI.,"as administrators of moral government, even after they had begun to"
13994,SECT. VI.,be charged with instances of immorality. But an unscrupulous order
13995,SECT. VI.,"and succession of judges, would in time put an end to the idea of"
13996,SECT. VI.,public justice; and so the continuing and growing degradation of the
13997,SECT. VI.,"Immortals, in time put an end to the sense of religion, and made even"
13998,SECT. VI.,"its fanes[757] smoky, and its pomps contemptible."

14010,SECT. VI.,~_Moral bearing of the Religion on the poems._~
14011,SECT. VI.,
14012,SECT. VI.,"The credit for moral results, which has thus been allowed to the"
14013,SECT. VI.,"probable operation of the Homeric Theo-mythology in the world, must"
14014,SECT. VI.,"be steadily denied to its influence upon the poems, where it appears"
14015,SECT. VI.,"before us as in the main a lowering and corrupting agency. In fact,"
14016,SECT. VI.,"the religion and the morality of the Homeric poems appear to separate,"
14017,SECT. VI.,and to run in opposite directions. The rights of the question at
14018,SECT. VI.,"issue, in an ethical point of view, are plainly with the Greeks: they"
14019,SECT. VI.,"vindicate by arms not one only, but two principles, both of them vital"
14020,SECT. VI.,"to the order of society, and to individual happiness and virtue: the"
14021,SECT. VI.,"sanctity, first, of the family and of marriage ties; secondly, of the"
14022,SECT. VI.,relation created by the rites of hospitality. And with the rights go
14023,SECT. VI.,the fortunes of the cause. The capture and fall of Troy constitute a
14024,SECT. VI.,great triumph of justice over wrong.
14025,SECT. VI.,
14026,SECT. VI.,But the mythological elements of the question are cast in a mould
14027,SECT. VI.,entirely different. The royal family of Troy has been all along
14028,SECT. VI.,"in singular favour with the deities, notwithstanding the perjury"
14029,SECT. VI.,of Laomedon; and that favour does not appear to be in any degree
14030,SECT. VI.,diminished by the gross and shameful crimes that stand against Paris
14031,SECT. VI.,"in the poem, or by the unfailing and extraordinary obtuseness of his"
14032,SECT. VI.,"moral sense. Ganymede, Tithonus, Anchises, as well as Paris, have all"
14033,SECT. VI.,been especial objects of divine regard. Not only did a full half of
14034,SECT. VI.,"the other deities take part with the Trojans in the war, but Jupiter"
14035,SECT. VI.,"himself, apart from his concession to Thetis, was concerned for them,"
14036,SECT. VI.,"and says[758], ‘They interest me even while they perish’ (μέλουσί μοι"
14037,SECT. VI.,ὀλλύμενοί περ).

14039,SECT. VI.,[758] Il. xx. 21.
14040,SECT. VI.,
14041,SECT. VI.,"Again, in the meeting of the gods, he describes Hector[759] as dear to"
14042,SECT. VI.,"them for his regular and abundant sacrifices, taking no note whatever"
14043,SECT. VI.,of his personal virtues. Of the three deities who were actively hostile
14044,SECT. VI.,"to Troy, Neptune, Juno, and Minerva, all had personal causes of"
14045,SECT. VI.,"offence: the first, the fraud of Laomedon, which, however, was also an"
14046,SECT. VI.,offence against the moral law; both the others had the _spretæ injuria
14047,SECT. VI.,"formæ_, and Juno had also special predilections to gratify. The fall"
14048,SECT. VI.,"of Ilios, and the death of Hector, are just: but the wonder is, with"
14049,SECT. VI.,the favourable relations that subsisted between the Trojans and the
14050,SECT. VI.,"father of gods, as well as men, which were in no respect impaired by"
14051,SECT. VI.,"crime, how Hector came to die, or Troy to fall. While the fall of Troy"
14052,SECT. VI.,"is justice, it does not seem to come about because it is agreeable to"
14053,SECT. VI.,"justice, but rather as the result of the balance of force among the"
14054,SECT. VI.,"gods, and of their remembrance of personal injuries. It appears all"
14055,SECT. VI.,"along, as though it were the right-mindedness of the Poet which keeps"
14056,SECT. VI.,"the wheels of the machine going, while those who should be the drivers"
14057,SECT. VI.,are at fault.

14061,SECT. VI.,"Again, in the Odyssey, the Providence of the poem, if we may so speak,"
14062,SECT. VI.,"is on the side of Virtue; and a prosperous remainder of life, with"
14063,SECT. VI.,"a happy death, is promised to the hero. Of this providence Minerva,"
14064,SECT. VI.,"with the approval of Jupiter, is the wise and indefatigable organ. But"
14065,SECT. VI.,"while the general idea of providence moves in the right direction,"
14066,SECT. VI.,the polytheistic formations work powerfully in a wrong one. David and
14067,SECT. VI.,"his companions ate the show-bread in the temple, and were blameless,"
14068,SECT. VI.,because it was to relieve a hunger that they had no other means of
14069,SECT. VI.,satisfying: but even impending famine does not excuse or palliate the
14070,SECT. VI.,"offence of the companions of Ulysses, who use for food a portion of"
14071,SECT. VI.,"the oxen of the Sun. The jealousy and cruelty of Neptune, the gifts"
14072,SECT. VI.,"of Mercury to Autolycus, the savage crimes of Polyphemus, which do"
14073,SECT. VI.,"not detract from his relation to a deity of the highest rank, the"
14074,SECT. VI.,"disparagement of the highest human virtues in Calypso, the hostility"
14075,SECT. VI.,"to human peace and happiness in Circe and the Sirens, place the divine"
14076,SECT. VI.,"life of the Odyssey on a much lower level than the human and heroic,"
14077,SECT. VI.,and to a certain extent depress by their admixture the sound ethical
14078,SECT. VI.,"tone of the poem. All along, while Homer luxuriates, poetically, in the"
14079,SECT. VI.,"abundance and brilliancy of his materials, he has morally to repair"
14080,SECT. VI.,"their deficiencies, and to contend with and overrule their bias."
14081,SECT. VI.,
14082,SECT. VI.,"I cannot therefore but differ greatly from Nitzsch, who, in his Essay"
14083,SECT. VI.,"on the Anger of Neptune[760], seems to elevate it to the dignity of a"
14084,SECT. VI.,"providential resentment, and to conceive of the sufferings of Ulysses"
14085,SECT. VI.,as a punishment for a moral offence in the treatment of Polyphemus.
14086,SECT. VI.,In this way I grant that a sort of parallel is established between
14087,SECT. VI.,"his case and the chastisements which Achilles receives in the Iliad,"
14088,SECT. VI.,"through the death of Patroclus, and the surrender of the body of"
14089,SECT. VI.,Hector. Both heroes seem thus to stand upon a level: both favoured
14090,SECT. VI.,"children of the gods, honoured in the main, but chastised for their"
14091,SECT. VI.,faults. But even this seeming parallelism fails when we remember the
14092,SECT. VI.,respective sequels. The curtain of the Iliad falls on the eve of the
14093,SECT. VI.,premature death of Achilles: as that of the Odyssey is dropping over
14094,SECT. VI.,"the head of Ulysses, we perceive, in perspective, the picture of his"
14095,SECT. VI.,serene old age.

14099,SECT. VI.,"As regards the important question of purity, the impression made on"
14100,SECT. VI.,"my own mind in reading the poems of Homer is this: that, but for his"
14101,SECT. VI.,"mythology, they would have been unimpeachable, at least in one point of"
14102,SECT. VI.,virtue; they would have been absolutely pure. Whatever is dissolute in
14103,SECT. VI.,"their moral tendency as regards this particular subject, evidently and"
14104,SECT. VI.,directly flows from that source. We rarely meet a sentiment that can
14105,SECT. VI.,arouse anything like revulsion: the worst by far that has struck me is
14106,SECT. VI.,"the advice given to Achilles by his mother Thetis (Il. xxiv. 130), as"
14107,SECT. VI.,a mode of solace for his grief. The narrative of the Net of Vulcan in
14108,SECT. VI.,"the Odyssey is one, that Homer would have been far too modest to recite"
14109,SECT. VI.,"with reference to human beings: and the only other passage, which seems"
14110,SECT. VI.,"to be marked with a tinge of grossness, is that which relates to the"
14111,SECT. VI.,stratagem of Juno in the Fourteenth Iliad.

14113,SECT. VI.,~_Its bearing as to poetic effect._~
14114,SECT. VI.,
14115,SECT. VI.,"We may, however, justly distinguish between the influence of mythology"
14116,SECT. VI.,"on the morality of the Poems, and its operation with regard to poetic"
14117,SECT. VI.,"effect. In this view the consequences of its introduction, though"
14118,SECT. VI.,"mixed, are upon the whole highly favourable. There is indeed more or"
14119,SECT. VI.,"less of descent from the usual grandeur of Homer, when we find his"
14120,SECT. VI.,deities mingling in actual conflict: because they never sustain in
14121,SECT. VI.,the field of battle a part at all corresponding to their celestial
14122,SECT. VI.,"dignity and presumed power. Nor is the Theomachy proper, in the"
14123,SECT. VI.,"Twenty-first book of the Iliad, among the most successful parts of"
14124,SECT. VI.,the poem. But the principal portion of their agency takes effect upon
14125,SECT. VI.,"the elements or other material objects, or upon animals, or upon the"
14126,SECT. VI.,human mind by way of influence and suggestion: and its tendency is in
14127,SECT. VI.,"general to impart interest and variety, as well as poetic elevation,"
14128,SECT. VI.,to the scenery and narrative. The plot of each epic is worked out
14129,SECT. VI.,simultaneously in two different forms upon two different arenas: in
14130,SECT. VI.,"Olympus by divine counsel, and on earth by human effort and execution."
14131,SECT. VI.,"Yet no confusion results from the double action, while the play and"
14132,SECT. VI.,counterplay of the divine and human elements communicate a remarkable
14133,SECT. VI.,elasticity to the movement of the poems. Their value is particularly
14134,SECT. VI.,"felt in the Iliad, which, from its limited scene and subject, lies in"
14135,SECT. VI.,"danger of the sameness which, by this means among others, it on the"
14136,SECT. VI.,"whole escapes. In particular, the relation between the assisting or"
14137,SECT. VI.,"patron deities, and the hero or protagonist of each poem, is conducted"
14138,SECT. VI.,with great consistency and effect: but the most sublime uses of
14139,SECT. VI.,supernatural machinery to be found throughout the poems are those in
14140,SECT. VI.,which the traces of it are the most shadowy and faintly drawn. Take
14141,SECT. VI.,for example the manner in which Achilles is sent out unarmed to the
14142,SECT. VI.,"field, and again, to the manner of his arming, in the Iliad: in the"
14143,SECT. VI.,"Odyssey, the wonderful picture of divine displeasure and incumbent"
14144,SECT. VI.,malediction seeming to gather around and hem in the Suitors of
14145,SECT. VI.,"Penelope, concurrently with the preparations for human vengeance: as if"
14146,SECT. VI.,the scene were too dark for eyes like theirs to catch the true meaning
14147,SECT. VI.,"of these lowering signals, which give a gloomy but majestic sanction to"

14150,SECT. VI.,~_Its earliest and latest forms._~
14151,SECT. VI.,
14152,SECT. VI.,It would be most interesting to pursue the comparison between the
14153,SECT. VI.,"believing or credulous infancy of Paganism as we see it in Homer, and"
14154,SECT. VI.,its cold and jealous decrepitude as we find it in the writers of its
14155,SECT. VI.,"latest period, when the light of the lamp was fading before the already"
14156,SECT. VI.,risen Sun.
14157,SECT. VI.,
14158,SECT. VI.,In Homer we find the gods offering in their conduct every sort of
14159,SECT. VI.,"example of weakness, passion, and fraud. But they take an active"
14160,SECT. VI.,"share in the government of the world, and men look up to them,"
14161,SECT. VI.,"collectively or individually, with more or less of confusion indeed,"
14162,SECT. VI.,"both intellectual and moral, but still truly and actually as exercising"
14163,SECT. VI.,some sort of providential government over the world. The mythology of
14164,SECT. VI.,"the time of Homer is a weak, faulty, and corrupt religion, I admit, but"
14165,SECT. VI.,"still it is a religion, a bond which associates man with the unseen"
14166,SECT. VI.,"world, and brings some, at least, of its influences to bear upon his"
14167,SECT. VI.,conduct and character. And if the Greeks of Homer were not shocked by
14168,SECT. VI.,those immoralities of the Immortals which afterwards came to be thought
14169,SECT. VI.,"intolerable, it was not because they were more impure than their"
14170,SECT. VI.,"posterity, for they were far purer: but the principle of belief in the"
14171,SECT. VI.,invisible was in them alike lively and inconsequent; and it was not yet
14172,SECT. VI.,"even conscious of a load which, in later times, with enfeebled force,"
14173,SECT. VI.,"and an augmented critical activity, it could not carry."
14174,SECT. VI.,
14175,SECT. VI.,"In the time of Plutarch, about one hundred years after our Lord’s"
14176,SECT. VI.,"nativity, we find the change complete. There was now no principle of"
14177,SECT. VI.,belief in men’s minds which could endure either the good or the evil
14178,SECT. VI.,"of the ancient system: and a quickened intelligence, as well as the"
14179,SECT. VI.,"streaming in of rays from Revelation, had made the human intellect"
14180,SECT. VI.,"more painfully alive to its moral solecisms, without rendering it"
14181,SECT. VI.,"able to suggest a remedy. Accordingly, Plutarch relieves the Homeric"
14182,SECT. VI.,"deities from the faults imputed to them by saying, that the Poet has"
14183,SECT. VI.,made use of these fictions to excite the fancy[761]: ἐκεῖνα πέπλασται
14184,SECT. VI.,"πρὸς ἐκπλῆξιν ἀνθρώπων. Or, again, it was, he says[762], because"
14185,SECT. VI.,"the name of Τύχη, Fortune or Chance, was not yet in use, that men"
14186,SECT. VI.,referred to the gods what they did not know how to account for in
14187,SECT. VI.,"any other manner. Alas for mankind! sad is the state of those, who"
14188,SECT. VI.,must reckon the invention of that name among their blessings. In the
14189,SECT. VI.,"fact, however, that Homer and his age knew nothing of the word or the"
14190,SECT. VI.,"idea, he discloses to us one of the many points in which infancy is"
14191,SECT. VI.,"practically wiser than old age. Let us, Plutarch goes on to say, cure"
14192,SECT. VI.,these errors by other passages of the Poet in which he gives us the
14193,SECT. VI.,"truth, the ὑγιαίνουσαι περὶ θεῶν δόξαι καὶ ἀληθεῖς: but the passages,"
14194,SECT. VI.,"which he cites with this view, are not passages where the deities are"
14195,SECT. VI.,represented as in any active relations of good towards the world: they
14196,SECT. VI.,are simply those which exhibit them as living in a repose undisturbed
14197,SECT. VI.,"by care, while they leave for us a destiny of trouble: they are those"
14198,SECT. VI.,"which relate to the θεοὶ ῥεῖα ζώοντες, the αὐτοὶ δέ τ’ ἀκηδέες εἰσίν."
14199,SECT. VI.,"Stripped of active vice, but yet not adorned with virtue, they become"
14200,SECT. VI.,"merely cold and selfish, hopeless and inaccessible abstractions."

14204,SECT. VI.,[762] Ibid. 23.
14205,SECT. VI.,
14206,SECT. VI.,There is in all this a certain logical sequence. The starting point is
14207,SECT. VI.,"that of belief in a moral Governor of the universe, good himself, and"
14208,SECT. VI.,"enjoining goodness upon others. But his own goodness fails, and his"
14209,SECT. VI.,agency among men for the original purpose becomes more and more feeble
14210,SECT. VI.,"and equivocal, while the human intellect, sharpened by discussion,"
14211,SECT. VI.,"and puffed up with knowledge, or with the supposition and phantasm"
14212,SECT. VI.,"of it, becomes more and more exacting: so that the abstract gods in"
14213,SECT. VI.,Cicero are (without doubt) far more elevated than the personal gods of
14214,SECT. VI.,"Homer. But they are mere works of art: and, after all, the personal"
14215,SECT. VI.,gods of Homer were the only ones that had been really worshipped by
14216,SECT. VI.,men: and when their case becomes so bad that they can no longer be
14217,SECT. VI.,"exhibited to the people as rulers of the world, a refuge is found in"
14218,SECT. VI.,"the Epicurean theory, which relegates them to a heaven of enjoyment and"
14219,SECT. VI.,"abundance, and on pretence of mental ease denies them any prerogative"
14220,SECT. VI.,of intervention in human affairs[763]. The gain of more careful and
14221,SECT. VI.,comprehensive theory is much more than counterbalanced by the practical
14222,SECT. VI.,"loss of the personal element, and therefore of the belief in a real"
14223,SECT. VI.,"Providence, overseeing the affairs of men. So the next onward step"
14224,SECT. VI.,"is to the doctrine of the Academicians. In the _De Naturâ Deorum_,"
14225,SECT. VI.,where that sect is represented by Cotta in the discussion with the
14226,SECT. VI.,"champions of the Epicureans and the Stoics, Cicero himself, and the"
14227,SECT. VI.,"ruling tendency, if not opinion, of his day, are evidently exhibited"
14228,SECT. VI.,to us under Cotta’s name. The transition now made is from gods with a
14229,SECT. VI.,"sinecure to no gods at all: and Paganism ends in nullity, just as a"
14230,SECT. VI.,moving mass finds its final equilibrium in repose.

14235,SECT. VI.,
14236,SECT. VI.,"Even while heroic Greece and its great Poet existed, the deepest"
14237,SECT. VI.,problems of our being were far too dark for man to penetrate. The
14238,SECT. VI.,"picture which I have rudely drawn, and which is not wholly a joyless"
14239,SECT. VI.,"picture, was liable to be blackened, even for this world, by many a"
14240,SECT. VI.,storm of crime and of calamity; at the very best it was a picture for
14241,SECT. VI.,"this world only, for the mortality and not the immortality of man. But"
14242,SECT. VI.,"that scene has its close: and most touching it is to see that, with"
14243,SECT. VI.,"all his creative power, with all his imaginative brightness, with all"
14244,SECT. VI.,"the advantage he derived from living in the youth of the world, before"
14245,SECT. VI.,"mankind had fully sounded the depth of their own fall, or had begun to"
14246,SECT. VI.,accumulate the sad records of their miseries and crimes; even Homer
14247,SECT. VI.,"could not solve the enigma of our condition, or disperse the clouds"
14248,SECT. VI.,that gathered round our destiny. There are two profoundly memorable
14249,SECT. VI.,"passages in the poems, which have set their double seal on this truth."
14250,SECT. VI.,One of them is in the Odyssey: it is a confession from the mouth
14251,SECT. VI.,"of that Achilles, in whose mind and person, as they are delineated"
14252,SECT. VI.,"by Homer, our humanity has been carried perhaps to a higher point"
14253,SECT. VI.,"of grandeur, than it has ever since attained. ‘Do not, illustrious"
14254,SECT. VI.,"Ulysses, do not palter with me about death,’ says the mournful shade."
14255,SECT. VI.,"‘Rather would I serve for hire under a master, aye and a needy master,"

14268,SECT. VI.,"and of two more, one a son of Jupiter, already in the peaceful Elysian"
14269,SECT. VI.,"plains, and the other Menelaus, who, as his daughter’s husband, was"
14270,SECT. VI.,likewise to be carried thither on his decease. But it is the mouth of
14271,SECT. VI.,"Achilles, the illustrious, the godlike Achilles, which here utters, in"
14272,SECT. VI.,"tones so deeply mournful, the common voice of the children of Adam."
14273,SECT. VI.,
14274,SECT. VI.,"It was the very same conclusion which, as we find in another"

14280,SECT. VI.,"epithets used by Homer for βροτοὶ, mortals, are δειλοὶ and οἰζυροὶ, so"
14281,SECT. VI.,"the highest god lays down the law of their condition, describing it as"
14282,SECT. VI.,that than which there is nothing more wretched among all that live and
14283,SECT. VI.,move upon the earth[766]:
14284,SECT. VI.,

14293,SECT. VI.,"life he might, upon the whole, be paramount in woe above all meaner"
14294,SECT. VI.,"creatures, and then that he might die in a gloom unrelieved by hope."
14295,SECT. VI.,None have illustrated this piercing truth by contrasts so sharp as
14296,SECT. VI.,"Homer, between the chill and dismal tone of the general destiny of man"
14297,SECT. VI.,"on the one hand, and on the other, the joy and cheerfulness which the"
14298,SECT. VI.,effort of an elastic spirit can for a time create. But the woe which he
14299,SECT. VI.,"could only exhibit, it was reserved for One greater than he, yet only"
14300,SECT. VI.,"by sorrow and suffering, to remove."
14301,SECT. VI.,
14302,SECT. VI.,~_The personal belief of Homer._~
14303,SECT. VI.,
14304,SECT. VI.,I have forborne in this Essay from entering at large into the often
14305,SECT. VI.,"agitated question, whether Homer believed in the deities of whom he"
14306,SECT. VI.,speaks so largely. He may express his own childlike creed; and such
14307,SECT. VI.,"a creed by no means requires for its support in the individual mind,"
14308,SECT. VI.,that it should have been visibly represented by facts within its own
14309,SECT. VI.,"experience. Or he may use as the material of poetry that which, without"
14310,SECT. VI.,"approving itself to his own heart, was, nevertheless, to his hearers"
14311,SECT. VI.,"in general, a real and substantial system of religion. Nay, he might"
14312,SECT. VI.,"even be dealing with what had ceased to be believed in his day, but"
14313,SECT. VI.,"had still a retrospective life, because it had been the hearty, and"
14314,SECT. VI.,"was still the conventional, worship of the people. The truth may lie"
14315,SECT. VI.,"in, or it may lie between, any of these suppositions. The one thing"
14316,SECT. VI.,"of which I feel most assured is, that he was not, as to his religion,"
14317,SECT. VI.,"a mere allegorist when speaking of his Jupiter and Minerva, any more"
14318,SECT. VI.,"than he was a mere hypocrite, when he ascribed occurrences in human"
14319,SECT. VI.,"life to Providence under the name of ‘the deity,’ or ‘the deities.’ He"
14320,SECT. VI.,"represents what either was or had been, for his people, a belief in the"
14321,SECT. VI.,"unseen under particular forms, and what still in some way represented"
14322,SECT. VI.,a reality for them and for himself. It is this belief of which I have
14323,SECT. VI.,"spoken throughout, and which, under any of the suppositions I have"
14324,SECT. VI.,"made, seems to me to warrant all the stress I have laid upon it."
14325,SECT. VI.,
14326,SECT. VI.,"To attempt a formal solution of the question, whether he believed or"
14327,SECT. VI.,"not in the dress of his religion, as well as in the religion itself,"
14328,SECT. VI.,"would, I fear, be frivolous. It is a case in some degree parallel to"
14329,SECT. VI.,"the disputes whether Shakspeare adhered, in the controversies of the"
14330,SECT. VI.,"sixteenth century, to the side of the Romish or the Reformed. Neither"
14331,SECT. VI.,Shakspeare nor Homer ought to be judged as if they had been theologians
14332,SECT. VI.,"_ex professo_. Both followed the law of their sublime art, and"
14333,SECT. VI.,"represented in forms of beauty and delight, or of majesty and gloom, as"
14334,SECT. VI.,"the case required, such materials as they found ready to hand. Critical"
14335,SECT. VI.,"analysis, nice equipoises, strict definitions, were for neither the"
14336,SECT. VI.,one nor the other. But in the works of neither do the cold tones of
14337,SECT. VI.,scepticism find an echo: and probably the mental frame of both with
14338,SECT. VI.,reference to the substance of their religion may have been not very
14339,SECT. VI.,"different from that of the poor, the maidens, and the children of their"
14340,SECT. VI.,day.

14348,SECT. VII.,
14349,SECT. VII.,
14350,SECT. VII.,Let me now attempt to divide the principal deities of Homer with
14351,SECT. VII.,"reference to their origin, or to the channel of their introduction into"
14352,SECT. VII.,"Greece; premising, however, that all such classification of them is"
14353,SECT. VII.,"admitted to be founded upon evidence, at best presumptive, and often"
14354,SECT. VII.,also slight.
14355,SECT. VII.,
14356,SECT. VII.,The classes will be as follows:
14357,SECT. VII.,
14358,SECT. VII.,"1. Of those who were worshipped by the Hellenic and Pelasgian races,"
14359,SECT. VII.,and probably by all others known in the inner Homeric world.
14360,SECT. VII.,
14361,SECT. VII.,"These were,"
14362,SECT. VII.,
14363,SECT. VII.,1. Jupiter.
14364,SECT. VII.,2. Minerva.
14365,SECT. VII.,3. Apollo.
14366,SECT. VII.,4. Latona.
14367,SECT. VII.,5. Diana.
14368,SECT. VII.,6. Neptune.
14369,SECT. VII.,
14370,SECT. VII.,The three first of these may be considered as deities of immemorial and
14371,SECT. VII.,universal worship. Neptune was far more Hellenic than Pelasgian: and
14372,SECT. VII.,indeed his place in the list is doubtful.
14373,SECT. VII.,
14374,SECT. VII.,2. Of immemorial Hellenic worship.
14375,SECT. VII.,
14376,SECT. VII.,1. Juno.
14377,SECT. VII.,2. Persephone.
14378,SECT. VII.,3. Pluto or Aidoneus.
14379,SECT. VII.,
14380,SECT. VII.,3. Of established Pelasgian worship.
14381,SECT. VII.,
14382,SECT. VII.,1. Demeter or Ceres.
14383,SECT. VII.,"2. Venus, more recent than the former."
14384,SECT. VII.,
14385,SECT. VII.,4. Of worship introduced to the Greek races within the memory of man.
14386,SECT. VII.,
14387,SECT. VII.,"_a._ Brought in from Phœnicia, or through the channel of the Phœnicians."
14388,SECT. VII.,
14389,SECT. VII.,"1. Hermes, or Mercury."
14390,SECT. VII.,"2. Hephæstus, or Vulcan."
14391,SECT. VII.,"3. Dionysus, or Bacchus."
14392,SECT. VII.,
14393,SECT. VII.,_b._ From Thrace.
14394,SECT. VII.,
14395,SECT. VII.,Mars.
14396,SECT. VII.,
14397,SECT. VII.,"_c._ Paieon has no note of country, except in so far as he may be"
14398,SECT. VII.,connected with Egypt by the declaration that the Egyptians were of his
14399,SECT. VII.,race.
14400,SECT. VII.,
14401,SECT. VII.,"Ἠέλιος, the Sun, appears to be placed in connection, by the various"
14402,SECT. VII.,"notes he bears, both with Egypt and with the Persian name."
14403,SECT. VII.,
14404,SECT. VII.,"All these deities were, with some others, more or less naturalized"
14405,SECT. VII.,among the Greeks within Homer’s lifetime. Themis was probably a pure
14406,SECT. VII.,"Hellenic creation, as Vesta seems to have been Pelasgian: the latter"
14407,SECT. VII.,"exhibiting the genius of domestic order, the former, its fuller"
14408,SECT. VII.,"development in political society. But Vesta is, though an Homeric idea,"
14409,SECT. VII.,not an Homeric goddess.
14410,SECT. VII.,
14411,SECT. VII.,"Now while Homer fails, or more probably avoids, to give us any direct"
14412,SECT. VII.,"information about the derivation of the Greek races or deities, he"
14413,SECT. VII.,notwithstanding establishes by partial and incidental notices many
14414,SECT. VII.,"traces of exterior affinity, not always the less secure and trustworthy"
14415,SECT. VII.,because they are negative.
14416,SECT. VII.,
14417,SECT. VII.,"While going through the divinities in detail, I have remarked upon such"
14418,SECT. VII.,"traits of their character, history, or worship, as appeared to connect"
14419,SECT. VII.,"them with any particular origin; but the question remains, can we find,"
14420,SECT. VII.,"through however rude a resemblance, any general model abroad for the"
14421,SECT. VII.,"Olympian system, or, in the absence of such a model, any presumptive"
14422,SECT. VII.,"evidence from Homer, which may serve to connect it with any national or"
14423,SECT. VII.,local root or roots in particular?
14424,SECT. VII.,
14425,SECT. VII.,~_The Olympian Gods and the Ethiopians._~
14426,SECT. VII.,
14427,SECT. VII.,"It is well worthy of remark, that he has associated the body of the"
14428,SECT. VII.,"Greek deities, as a body, with one, and one only, point, exterior to"
14429,SECT. VII.,the Greek nation. That point is the country of the Ethiopians.
14430,SECT. VII.,
14431,SECT. VII.,Homer has shown a peculiar interest in these Ethiopians. They are
14432,SECT. VII.,ἀμύμονες: an epithet which he appears to connect especially with purity
14433,SECT. VII.,"of blood. In the First Iliad, the whole body of the gods are absent"
14434,SECT. VII.,"from Olympus for eleven days, to enjoy the sacrifices offered by that"
14435,SECT. VII.,"people. In the Twenty-second Iliad, the statement is less express as"
14436,SECT. VII.,to time; but again they are apparently enjoying themselves in the same
14437,SECT. VII.,"quarter, during the funeral rites of Patroclus, and Iris is in haste"
14438,SECT. VII.,"to go thither, that she may not lose her share. In the First Odyssey,"
14439,SECT. VII.,"Neptune is among the same people for the same purpose, while the other"
14440,SECT. VII.,"deities are in Olympus. In the Fifth Odyssey, he is coming from among"
14441,SECT. VII.,"them, when he espies Ulysses on his raft. The time intervening is so"
14442,SECT. VII.,"considerable, that we must presume the two last-mentioned passages to"
14443,SECT. VII.,refer to two separate visits.
14444,SECT. VII.,
14445,SECT. VII.,The following points may be considered as established:
14446,SECT. VII.,
14447,SECT. VII.,"1. The Ethiopians, visited as above, must be supposed by Homer in the"
14448,SECT. VII.,main to worship the same body of deities as the Greeks.
14449,SECT. VII.,
14450,SECT. VII.,2. The Ethiopians extend from the rising to the setting sun; but those
14451,SECT. VII.,"Ethiopians of whom Homer speaks particularly, are in connection with"
14452,SECT. VII.,"sacrifices in the East; for the Solyman mountains[767], as conceived by"
14453,SECT. VII.,"him, probably border upon Lycia, and they are on Neptune’s route[768],"
14454,SECT. VII.,"from the Ethiopian country back to the sea, which, as I hope to show"
14455,SECT. VII.,"elsewhere, runs along the double line of the Mediterranean and the"
14456,SECT. VII.,Euxine.

14461,SECT. VII.,
14462,SECT. VII.,"3. They are further fixed in a southern country by their name, which"
14463,SECT. VII.,"indicates darkness or swarthiness of countenance, and by the visit of"
14464,SECT. VII.,"Menelaus to them in the course of his adventures, which lay exclusively"
14465,SECT. VII.,to the southward.
14466,SECT. VII.,
14467,SECT. VII.,4. They are evidently distinguished by great liberality or high favour
14468,SECT. VII.,in the sacrificial service of the gods.
14469,SECT. VII.,
14470,SECT. VII.,"5. They are defined to be by the Ocean, and thus in the farthest"
14471,SECT. VII.,situation to the South-east that was conceived of by Homer and the
14472,SECT. VII.,Greeks.
14473,SECT. VII.,
14474,SECT. VII.,"6. At the same time, although they are the farthest men in that"
14475,SECT. VII.,"direction[769], they are nowhere described as lying at a very great"
14476,SECT. VII.,absolute distance. They are simply τηλόθ’ ἐόντες.

14480,SECT. VII.,"Now it is not only possible, but on every ground likely, that in his"
14481,SECT. VII.,"conception of the South-eastern Ethiopians, Homer mixed up together"
14482,SECT. VII.,"various traditions, belonging to different places and nations. Even as,"
14483,SECT. VII.,"in his conception of the Mouth of Ocean, which is with him always one"
14484,SECT. VII.,"single mouth, he seems to have blended and amalgamated geographical"
14485,SECT. VII.,"reports founded upon more than one original, or prototype, in nature."
14486,SECT. VII.,
14487,SECT. VII.,The Solyman name has suggested to some critics a connection with the
14488,SECT. VII.,Salem of the Hebrews. But the name is much more likely to be derived
14489,SECT. VII.,"from the Soliman Koh, a ridge of mountains running to the south-west"
14490,SECT. VII.,"from Caubul, and sometimes defined as extending into Persia. The"
14491,SECT. VII.,"liberality in sacrifice ill accords with the early Persian religion,"
14492,SECT. VII.,but finds a probable original in that of the Medes with their order
14493,SECT. VII.,"of Magians. But upon the whole, it would seem that Homer must have"
14494,SECT. VII.,had a reason for the peculiar prominence he has given to these
14495,SECT. VII.,"South-eastern Ethiopians, in connection with the gods of Olympus; for"
14496,SECT. VII.,"the association, unless suggested by a reason, is neither natural, nor"
14497,SECT. VII.,"in the manner of the Poet. Could it have been any other than this,"
14498,SECT. VII.,"that he regarded their country, however indeterminate its place in his"
14499,SECT. VII.,"imagination, as the original seat of the religion of his own, and that"
14500,SECT. VII.,he therefore referred it thither bodily without notice of details?
14501,SECT. VII.,"Now this would mean as the original seat, also, of the ancestors of"
14502,SECT. VII.,"the Hellenic tribes. We are not, in the event of accepting such a"
14503,SECT. VII.,"supposition, to imagine that he intended to make the assertion that the"
14504,SECT. VII.,"Olympian system had been derived from Persia and Media as it stood,"
14505,SECT. VII.,"but only to imply that there, according to national tradition, lay its"
14506,SECT. VII.,"root. The Trojans, it will be remembered, have their not Olympian but"
14507,SECT. VII.,"Idæan Jove: and the Ethiopians are the only foreign race, with whom he"
14508,SECT. VII.,associates Olympus and its band of Immortals.
14509,SECT. VII.,
14510,SECT. VII.,"I have already stated elsewhere grounds for supposing that the Achæans,"
14511,SECT. VII.,"as they were immediately an Hellenic, were also primarily, as well as"
14512,SECT. VII.,"the other Hellenes, a Persian race. We have seen the existence of the"
14513,SECT. VII.,"Persian name in Greece, and its connection, according to Homer, with"
14514,SECT. VII.,"what Homer thought the remotest East, by the shore of Ocean. We have"
14515,SECT. VII.,"also seen its connection with the Sun, the prime deity of the Persians."
14516,SECT. VII.,"This visible head of creation, standing next to the Supreme Being, we"
14517,SECT. VII.,"find that the Greeks speedily identify with their Apollo, who is so"
14518,SECT. VII.,"prominent as the son of Jupiter, in dignity, in obedience, and in his"
14519,SECT. VII.,"father’s favour, as to stand in a class entirely distinct from that of"
14520,SECT. VII.,his other sons.
14521,SECT. VII.,
14522,SECT. VII.,"On the one hand, we seem to find here matter confirmatory of the"
14523,SECT. VII.,"Persian origin of the Hellenic tribes; and on the other, a general"
14524,SECT. VII.,indication of the derivation of the earliest Greek religion from a
14525,SECT. VII.,certain part of the East. But still we must beware of any over-broad
14526,SECT. VII.,"inference. The religion, it is likely, grew largely as it travelled,"
14527,SECT. VII.,and was developed freely after it had reached its home in the Greek
14528,SECT. VII.,peninsula. And it would be contrary to all reason to suppose that
14529,SECT. VII.,Homer was in a condition to refer back to each of the Eastern races
14530,SECT. VII.,"their proper contribution towards the aggregate, though we may justly"
14531,SECT. VII.,suppose him able to draw some kind of line between the system as it
14532,SECT. VII.,"was flourishing in Greece, with all its additions, elaborations and"
14533,SECT. VII.,"refinements, and the crude undigested materials as they had been"
14534,SECT. VII.,"imported from abroad; perhaps we might say, between the system as he"
14535,SECT. VII.,"found it, and the same system as he left it."
14536,SECT. VII.,
14537,SECT. VII.,"Considering, however, that Homer had a quasi-geographical knowledge"
14538,SECT. VII.,"of Egypt, I do not suppose that that country enters at all into his"
14539,SECT. VII.,"conception of the Ethiopians. If so, then the representation of"
14540,SECT. VII.,"an unity of religion with the Ethiopians, affords a presumption,"
14541,SECT. VII.,conformable undoubtedly to such other presumptions as we have been
14542,SECT. VII.,"able to gather from the poems, that Homer did not regard Egypt as the"
14543,SECT. VII.,principal source of the religious system of Greece.

14583,SECT. VII.,"μήτηρ,) who appears in Il. xiv. 326 as one of the wives of Jupiter. The"
14584,SECT. VII.,"Celestial Venus may include traditions of Minerva, and of Artemis,--for"
14585,SECT. VII.,"the Scythians called her Artimpasa,--along with those which came to be"
14586,SECT. VII.,"represented in the Greek Ἀφροδίτη. All the deities, which from Homer’s"
14587,SECT. VII.,"text have appeared to be especially Hellenic, are also, it will be"
14588,SECT. VII.,"observed, absent from this list: Juno, Neptune, Aidoneus, Persephone,"
14589,SECT. VII.,"Vulcan, and Mercury."
14590,SECT. VII.,
14591,SECT. VII.,"But there were among these Scythians a tribe, called the Βασιλήϊοι"

14593,SECT. VII.,"among the Scythians a position, in great measure analogous to that of"
14594,SECT. VII.,the Hellenic tribes among the mass of the Pelasgian population. And
14595,SECT. VII.,"certainly it is not a little curious, that these kingly Scythians added"
14596,SECT. VII.,"to the list of properly Pelasgian deities the worship of Thamimasidas,"
14597,SECT. VII.,"a god of the sea, apparently equivalent to the Hellenic Poseidon."
14598,SECT. VII.,
14599,SECT. VII.,"Again, let us take the account given by Herodotus of the information"
14600,SECT. VII.,"he obtained in Egypt about the Greek mythology. He states to us that,"
14601,SECT. VII.,"with certain exceptions, the names of the Greek deities had been known"
14602,SECT. VII.,"in Egypt from time immemorial. His exceptions are, Neptune and Juno,"
14603,SECT. VII.,"the Dioscuri, Vesta, Themis, the Graces and the Nereids. The statement"
14604,SECT. VII.,"may at least be accepted as good to this extent, that the deities here"
14605,SECT. VII.,"named were not drawn from Egypt. They include, as will be seen, only"
14606,SECT. VII.,one personification of an idea which we have found cause to consider
14607,SECT. VII.,"Pelasgian, namely, Ἱστίη or _home_; with this Neptune and Juno, who"
14608,SECT. VII.,"were Hellic deities; the Dioscouroi, representing in an early stage"
14609,SECT. VII.,"the deification of national heroes; the Graces, or the impersonations"
14610,SECT. VII.,"of ideas; and the Nereids, or the personification of natural objects."
14611,SECT. VII.,All of these persons and processes we have already referred to the
14612,SECT. VII.,influence of the Hellic tribes.
14613,SECT. VII.,
14614,SECT. VII.,"Upon the whole, we appear to have in these accounts a much clearer"
14615,SECT. VII.,representation of the contribution made by the Pelasgian part of the
14616,SECT. VII.,nation to the Olympian system than we can find gathered elsewhere.
14617,SECT. VII.,"The Egyptian resemblances are chiefly isolated, though it may have"
14618,SECT. VII.,been from that quarter that Pelasgian Attica learned the name and
14619,SECT. VII.,"worship of the deity, which was afterwards developed into the Homeric"
14620,SECT. VII.,"Pallas-Athene: but among these Scythians we appear to find a group, who"
14621,SECT. VII.,exhibit to us in combination nearly all that we have reason to believe
14622,SECT. VII.,"specially Pelasgian, and, with the obscure exception of Hercules,"
14623,SECT. VII.,"nothing besides. While this group, as being Scythian, would have the"
14624,SECT. VII.,"Arian country for its point of origin, it may still be probable that"
14625,SECT. VII.,"other parts of the Olympian religion, besides the worship of Neptune,"
14626,SECT. VII.,"such as the Juno and the Persephone in particular, had come from the"
14627,SECT. VII.,‘Kingly’ Arians of the hills.
14628,SECT. VII.,
14629,SECT. VII.,Thus far as to the relation between the Homeric theo-mythology and
14630,SECT. VII.,any religious system or combination to be found elsewhere. Let us
14631,SECT. VII.,now consider how it stands with reference to each of the principal
14632,SECT. VII.,"elements, out of which the religions of the world were habitually"
14633,SECT. VII.,formed.
14634,SECT. VII.,
14635,SECT. VII.,~_Four several bases of religious systems._~
14636,SECT. VII.,
14637,SECT. VII.,"There appear to be four leading forms in which, either single or"
14638,SECT. VII.,"combined, religion has attracted, and more or less commanded, the"
14639,SECT. VII.,mind of man. It is scarcely needful to add that one alone of these
14640,SECT. VII.,"is genuine, and that the three others are essentially depraved, and"
14641,SECT. VII.,finally self-destructive.
14642,SECT. VII.,
14643,SECT. VII.,The first is the worship of the Divine Being: of which the Holy
14644,SECT. VII.,"Scriptures form, down to the period with which they close, the"
14645,SECT. VII.,principal record.
14646,SECT. VII.,
14647,SECT. VII.,"The second is the worship of man; founded, of course, upon his"
14648,SECT. VII.,deification. Of this the Greek mythology affords the most conspicuous
14649,SECT. VII.,and weighty instance.
14650,SECT. VII.,
14651,SECT. VII.,"The third is the worship of external and inanimate nature, which I"
14652,SECT. VII.,"mention next, not because of its place in the order of ideas, but"
14653,SECT. VII.,because of its great extension and influence over races of vast
14654,SECT. VII.,"numerical strength, antiquity, and importance."
14655,SECT. VII.,
14656,SECT. VII.,"The fourth is the worship of the inferior creation, or of animate"
14657,SECT. VII.,nature in its lower ranks.
14658,SECT. VII.,
14659,SECT. VII.,"We have considered, in a former section, how far the Greek mythology"
14660,SECT. VII.,"was indebted to the first of these sources, the true and pure one."
14661,SECT. VII.,
14662,SECT. VII.,"The second, or anthropophuism, appears to have formed its most proper"
14663,SECT. VII.,"and distinctive characteristic. Further, it was the intellectual"
14664,SECT. VII.,"rather than the carnal nature of man, which originally determined a"
14665,SECT. VII.,law for the construction of the Olympian system. The great traditive
14666,SECT. VII.,deities were remodelled according to what Scripture calls the ‘lust of
14667,SECT. VII.,"the mind,’ long before the ‘lust of the flesh’ had touched them. We"
14668,SECT. VII.,"see, too, that, of the deities of invention, those which were purely"
14669,SECT. VII.,"Hellenic, such as Juno and Themis in particular, represent either noble"
14670,SECT. VII.,"and commanding, or else pure, ideas, connected with the development"
14671,SECT. VII.,of human life and society; while it is generally in deities that have
14672,SECT. VII.,"not undergone a full Hellenic remodelling, that we see animal passion"
14673,SECT. VII.,"prevail; such as Mars, Venus, Ceres, and Aurora."
14674,SECT. VII.,
14675,SECT. VII.,~_Nature-worship._~
14676,SECT. VII.,
14677,SECT. VII.,"The third basis of religion is admirably described, together with its"
14678,SECT. VII.,"apology, and its condemnation, in the Book entitled the Wisdom of"
14679,SECT. VII.,Solomon[772]:
14680,SECT. VII.,
14681,SECT. VII.,[772] Wisdom xiii. 1-9.
14682,SECT. VII.,
14683,SECT. VII.,‘Neither by considering the works did they acknowledge the
14684,SECT. VII.,"workmaster; but deemed either fire, or wind, or the swift air, or the"
14685,SECT. VII.,"circle of the stars, or the violent water, or the lights of heaven,"
14686,SECT. VII.,to be the gods which govern the world. With whose beauty if they
14687,SECT. VII.,being delighted took them to be gods; let them know how much better
14688,SECT. VII.,the Lord of them is: for the first author of beauty hath created
14689,SECT. VII.,"them. But if they were astonished at their power and virtue, let them"
14690,SECT. VII.,"understand by them, how much mightier he is that made them. For, by"
14691,SECT. VII.,"the greatness and beauty of the creatures, proportionably the maker"
14692,SECT. VII.,of them is seen. But yet for this they are the less to be blamed;
14693,SECT. VII.,"for they peradventure err, seeking God, and desirous to find him."
14694,SECT. VII.,"For, being conversant in his works, they search him diligently, and"
14695,SECT. VII.,believe their sight: because the things are beautiful that are seen.
14696,SECT. VII.,"Howbeit, neither are they to be pardoned. For if they were able to"
14697,SECT. VII.,"know so much, that they could aim at the world; how did they not"
14698,SECT. VII.,sooner find out the Lord thereof?’
14699,SECT. VII.,
14700,SECT. VII.,"And then the Wise Man proceeds to show, that far inferior, again, to"
14701,SECT. VII.,"this, is the worship of mere images as gods."
14702,SECT. VII.,
14703,SECT. VII.,"The worship of the elemental powers enters, I think, only as a very"
14704,SECT. VII.,secondary ingredient into the Homeric or Olympian system: it is
14705,SECT. VII.,everywhere surmounted and circumscribed by developments drawn from
14706,SECT. VII.,tradition or from the principle of anthropophuism.
14707,SECT. VII.,
14708,SECT. VII.,It is true that most of the great physical agents are either
14709,SECT. VII.,"personified by him, or else are in immediate connection with some"
14710,SECT. VII.,one of his deities: but there is every appearance that the Greeks
14711,SECT. VII.,"sometimes expelled, sometimes reduced and depressed the principle of"
14712,SECT. VII.,"Nature-worship, in their adaptation of foreign materials to Hellenic"
14713,SECT. VII.,uses.
14714,SECT. VII.,
14715,SECT. VII.,"1. Jupiter and Neptune, as we have seen, preside over elements, but"
14716,SECT. VII.,they are not elemental. Their relations to air and sea are entirely
14717,SECT. VII.,"different from those of Vulcan to fire, and yet even he very greatly"
14718,SECT. VII.,transcends the dimensions of a merely elemental god. Their brotherhood
14719,SECT. VII.,"with Aidoneus, who is not elemental at all, indicates, together"
14720,SECT. VII.,"with all other signs, that the air and sea are their respective"
14721,SECT. VII.,"territories, and are not the basis of their divinity."
14722,SECT. VII.,
14723,SECT. VII.,"2. It seems quite impossible but that, if Nature-worship had been the"
14724,SECT. VII.,"basis of the system, the Sun, as the visible king of nature, must"
14725,SECT. VII.,have had a prominent and commanding position in the system; whereas
14726,SECT. VII.,his place in Homer is even less than secondary. Looking at the realm
14727,SECT. VII.,"of nature, to search out a varied organism, which would supply a"
14728,SECT. VII.,powerful apparatus of instruments operative upon man to a presiding
14729,SECT. VII.,"intelligence, the Greek naturally made Ζεὺς the king of Air. But had he"
14730,SECT. VII.,"merely wanted a symbol by which nature itself was to speak, how could"
14731,SECT. VII.,he have forborne to choose the Sun?
14732,SECT. VII.,
14733,SECT. VII.,"3. There is, indeed, an extended use in Homer of the imagery of"
14734,SECT. VII.,"Nature-Powers. But however prominent as poetry, this is altogether"
14735,SECT. VII.,"subordinate as religion. His Nymphs and River-gods people the unseen,"
14736,SECT. VII.,"adorn his verse, and even supply a kind of drapery to the scheme"
14737,SECT. VII.,of religious observances; but it is not by them that the world is
14738,SECT. VII.,"governed. And with them may very well be classed, as far as the present"
14739,SECT. VII.,"argument is concerned, the crowd of Homer’s metaphysical impersonations."
14740,SECT. VII.,
14741,SECT. VII.,"4. That Neptune in particular is not properly an elemental power, seems"
14742,SECT. VII.,to be made clear by three things at the least:
14743,SECT. VII.,
14744,SECT. VII.,a. He can act by land as well as sea; witness his building the wall of
14745,SECT. VII.,"Troy, and appearing as a warrior on the battle-field."
14746,SECT. VII.,
14747,SECT. VII.,"b. The θάλασσα, with which he is connected, is decidedly inferior, in"
14748,SECT. VII.,"its merely elemental character, to Oceanus; yet Oceanus has no share in"
14749,SECT. VII.,"the government of the world, and no moral personality, while Neptune"
14750,SECT. VII.,"has equal dignity with Jupiter, and is not far behind him in strength."
14751,SECT. VII.,
14752,SECT. VII.,"c. The true elemental gods of the θάλασσα, it is plain, according to"
14753,SECT. VII.,"Homer, are Nereus and Amphitrite; of whom the first is locally confined"
14754,SECT. VII.,"to the depths of the sea, and the other is scarcely a person, and"
14755,SECT. VII.,cannot ideally be disengaged from the curly-headed billows.
14756,SECT. VII.,
14757,SECT. VII.,"5. In the Olympian Court, which is the real centre, according to Homer,"
14758,SECT. VII.,"of the government of the world, there is scarcely to be found a pure"
14759,SECT. VII.,"example of a Nature-power; there is no one leading deity, in whom that"
14760,SECT. VII.,"idea is not wholly subordinate; and in many of the leading deities,"
14761,SECT. VII.,"such as Minerva, Apollo, and even Juno, it is hardly to be perceived at"
14762,SECT. VII.,all.
14763,SECT. VII.,
14764,SECT. VII.,6. As to Juno in particular. When we compare the Greek with the
14765,SECT. VII.,"Eastern religions, it appears that, if the former had been conceived"
14766,SECT. VII.,"in the same spirit as the latter, Juno ought to have been the earth,"
14767,SECT. VII.,"continually impregnated by the heaven, and yielding those fruits which"
14768,SECT. VII.,would then stand as the proper results of her maternity.
14769,SECT. VII.,
14770,SECT. VII.,"But instead of this, in the great lottery of the universe, earth is"
14771,SECT. VII.,"actually left out, and remains undisposed of. It never appears in"
14772,SECT. VII.,"Homer, except in a formula of adjuration, in which we may naturally"
14773,SECT. VII.,enough look to find antique ideas; and this seems like a stray vestige
14774,SECT. VII.,"of another system, really founded on Nature-worship. But there Γαῖα"
14775,SECT. VII.,"remains, so far as the Greeks are concerned, isolated and undeveloped."
14776,SECT. VII.,
14777,SECT. VII.,"Meantime, for the vegetative life of Earth, wedded to the Heavens, and"
14778,SECT. VII.,"bearing herbs and fruits, the Greek mind substitutes the intelligent"
14779,SECT. VII.,"life of a Queen-divinity, who with her husband becomes the nucleus of"
14780,SECT. VII.,"the Olympian order, and marks the transition from elemental religion to"
14781,SECT. VII.,anthropophuism.
14782,SECT. VII.,
14783,SECT. VII.,~_Secondary in the Olympian religion._~
14784,SECT. VII.,
14785,SECT. VII.,"There is then a greatly qualified sense, in which assent may be given"
14786,SECT. VII.,"to the proposition, that the Olympian dynasty of Homer sits enthroned"
14787,SECT. VII.,"upon the ruins of a more ancient Nature-worship, and the sense is"
14788,SECT. VII.,"this: that, before Hellenism had an historical existence, there were"
14789,SECT. VII.,systems founded on Nature-worship in the east; that these systems were
14790,SECT. VII.,"tributary to the religion of Olympus, and that its framers made such"
14791,SECT. VII.,use of them as they found convenient.
14792,SECT. VII.,
14793,SECT. VII.,But from Homer we are not authorized to believe that such a system of
14794,SECT. VII.,Nature-worship ever preceded in Greece the Olympian system. On the
14795,SECT. VII.,"contrary, the Κρόνος and Ῥέα, the Oceanus and Tethys of Homer, appear"
14796,SECT. VII.,"to be younger and not older than his chief Olympian gods; that is, they"
14797,SECT. VII.,"appear to be metaphysical creations, called into being to supply an"
14798,SECT. VII.,"ideal basis, a _matrix_ or mould, walled in with time and space, for"
14799,SECT. VII.,Jupiter and his wife and brothers to be cast in.
14800,SECT. VII.,
14801,SECT. VII.,"It is not before, but after the time of Homer, namely, in Hesiod, that"
14802,SECT. VII.,we see such development given to this pseudo-archaic system as can
14803,SECT. VII.,alone allow it to be taken for the image of something that had really
14804,SECT. VII.,"existed as a religion. For example, it would be quite out of keeping"
14805,SECT. VII.,with the tone of Homer were we to find in him the sentiment which is
14806,SECT. VII.,contained in a fragment of Euripides[773];

14813,SECT. VII.,~_Brute-worship._~
14814,SECT. VII.,
14815,SECT. VII.,We have still to consider the relation of the Olympian scheme to the
14816,SECT. VII.,last of the four στοιχεῖα. The principle of brute-worship was so marked
14817,SECT. VII.,"a characteristic of the Egyptian idolatry, that it seems to lie at"
14818,SECT. VII.,the very foundation of the system. Perhaps we should be justified in
14819,SECT. VII.,associating with this principle the inability of the Egyptians to
14820,SECT. VII.,attain to any high conceptions of beauty. They scarcely could soar
14821,SECT. VII.,in this respect above the standard of that which they regarded as a
14822,SECT. VII.,tabernacle meet for divinity to dwell in.
14823,SECT. VII.,
14824,SECT. VII.,The same principle appears to have found its way into Persia probably
14825,SECT. VII.,"at a late date, and from the Median, not the Eteo-persian, source"
14826,SECT. VII.,of the religious traditions of the country. Malcolm[774] has given
14827,SECT. VII.,"us the copies, from remains found in the country, of the Persian"
14828,SECT. VII.,"representations, probably however late ones, of their divinities,"
14829,SECT. VII.,exhibiting strange mixtures of human form with that of the brute.

14832,SECT. VII.,
14833,SECT. VII.,It would therefore be wonderful if we failed to find in the Greek
14834,SECT. VII.,"mythology some traces, however faint, of an element that not only"
14835,SECT. VII.,"existed in Asia, but displayed so much vigour there, as to have entered"
14836,SECT. VII.,deeply into the religion that even now sways a considerable portion
14837,SECT. VII.,"of its population, if not, indeed, to form the one really capital and"
14838,SECT. VII.,operative article of that religion.
14839,SECT. VII.,
14840,SECT. VII.,Döllinger[775] has noted the points connected with the state and being
14841,SECT. VII.,"of animals, which might suggest ideas capable of being developed into"
14842,SECT. VII.,this repulsive system. Such are the unity and tranquillity of animal
14843,SECT. VII.,life--it being borne in mind that domesticated animals were those
14844,SECT. VII.,"which supplied the chief type of deity. Such, again, is the instinct"
14845,SECT. VII.,"of the future, bearing a nearer outward resemblance to foreknowledge"
14846,SECT. VII.,"than would any anticipations founded on forethought, reasoning, and"
14847,SECT. VII.,"experience. Above all, there seems to be force in the remark that man,"
14848,SECT. VII.,"by his marked individuality, and by the freedom of the will, is, as it"
14849,SECT. VII.,"were, disabled from becoming the mere organ of another existence. The"
14850,SECT. VII.,"gods in assuming human form, assumed in a great degree human nature"
14851,SECT. VII.,also. But the passive and neutral nature of animals offered itself as
14852,SECT. VII.,"a medium without taste or colour, such as needed not in any manner to"
14853,SECT. VII.,alter or modify the powers of which it was to be the vehicle.

14865,SECT. VII.,~_Its vestiges in the Olympian religion._~
14866,SECT. VII.,
14867,SECT. VII.,The grossness of brute-worship was completely refined away by the
14868,SECT. VII.,Greeks during the process of transfer to their own mythology. The
14869,SECT. VII.,"vestiges of the system, and they are no more than vestiges, still"
14870,SECT. VII.,"traceable in the Homeric poems, are apparently as follows:"
14871,SECT. VII.,
14872,SECT. VII.,1. I find the chief note of it in the extraordinary sacredness of the
14873,SECT. VII.,"oxen of the Sun: a sacredness inconsistent and inexplicable, if it be"
14874,SECT. VII.,"tried only by the circumjacent incidents of the Odyssey, and by the"
14875,SECT. VII.,laws of the Greek mythology.
14876,SECT. VII.,
14877,SECT. VII.,"The offence of the crew of Ulysses consisted simply in this; that[777],"
14878,SECT. VII.,"after exhausting every effort to maintain themselves, when they have"
14879,SECT. VII.,"at length no alternative before them except that of starving, they"
14880,SECT. VII.,"consumed some of the best among these oxen for food. They observed,"
14881,SECT. VII.,"as far as they could, all the proper religious rites, but they used"
14882,SECT. VII.,"leaves instead of barley, and water for wine, inasmuch as neither of"
14883,SECT. VII.,the usual requisites were forthcoming. They promised a temple also to
14884,SECT. VII.,"the Sun, to be built on their return, and to be enriched with abundant"
14885,SECT. VII.,"votive offerings. Lastly, I think, any one who reads the manly and"
14886,SECT. VII.,"just speech of Eurylochus, in which he proposes the sacrilege, will"
14887,SECT. VII.,"judge that the sympathies of the Poet are with him. In this speech, he"
14888,SECT. VII.,"states the necessity; he next proceeds to vow the erection of a temple,"
14889,SECT. VII.,and dedication of its ornaments in the event of safe return. Then he
14890,SECT. VII.,"concludes by declaring, that if vengeance is, notwithstanding, to be"
14891,SECT. VII.,"taken on them, he for his part would far rather die once for all like"
14892,SECT. VII.,a man than famish in the solitary island. There is not in the tone of
14893,SECT. VII.,the speech the slightest indication of impiety[778].

14898,SECT. VII.,
14899,SECT. VII.,The terrible punishment inflicted was prefigured by extraordinary
14900,SECT. VII.,"portents. The empty hides of the animals crawled about[779], and the"
14901,SECT. VII.,flesh lowed on the very spits. Here we see at its climax the fine Greek
14902,SECT. VII.,"imagination, working upon the foundation supplied by the Egyptian"
14903,SECT. VII.,"superstition, and extracting from the coarsest earthy matter the means"
14904,SECT. VII.,of true poetical sublimity.
14905,SECT. VII.,
14906,SECT. VII.,[779] 394-6.
14907,SECT. VII.,
14908,SECT. VII.,"It is impossible to conceive a case, in which the offence committed is"
14909,SECT. VII.,"more exclusively of the kind termed positive, or more entirely severed"
14910,SECT. VII.,"from moral guilt, until we include the element to which the poems do"
14911,SECT. VII.,"not expressly refer, of the elevated sanctity attaching to the animal"
14912,SECT. VII.,"itself. The Homeric fiction is[780], that they were the playthings of"
14913,SECT. VII.,the Sun in his leisure hours. But to forbid the use of any of these
14914,SECT. VII.,"animals for food, even under the direst necessity, would have been"
14915,SECT. VII.,"simply to caricature the nature of positive commands, in the very same"
14916,SECT. VII.,"spirit as that which would have had, not the sabbath made for man, but"
14917,SECT. VII.,"man made for the sabbath. Still, when once we let in the assumption"
14918,SECT. VII.,"that these animals had essentially sacred lives, which might not"
14919,SECT. VII.,"be taken away, then the offence becomes a moral one of frightful"
14920,SECT. VII.,"profanation, and the vengeance so rigorously exacted is intelligible."
14921,SECT. VII.,
14922,SECT. VII.,[780] 379-81.
14923,SECT. VII.,
14924,SECT. VII.,I do not mean that Homer recognises that dogma which the Egyptians then
14925,SECT. VII.,"affirmed, and which at this present epoch, after the lapse of three"
14926,SECT. VII.,"thousand years, has wrought myriads of Hindoos to madness. The religion"
14927,SECT. VII.,"of Greece included no such idea, and the religious practice of the"
14928,SECT. VII.,Greeks wholly precluded it. But in this instance we see a part of the
14929,SECT. VII.,"Egyptian religion _in transitu_, in the very process of transmutation"
14930,SECT. VII.,"that it was to undergo when passing into the Greek mythology, which"
14931,SECT. VII.,"utterly repudiated its substance, but strove to retain an image of"
14932,SECT. VII.,"it under poetic forms, betraying by their inconsistency their exotic"
14933,SECT. VII.,origin.
14934,SECT. VII.,
14935,SECT. VII.,The consummation of the whole tale lies in this: that the vengeance
14936,SECT. VII.,"is not the mere personal act of the Sun, but is inflicted by Jupiter"
14937,SECT. VII.,"himself on behalf of the whole Olympian Court, to which the appeal had"
14938,SECT. VII.,been already made[781].

14940,SECT. VII.,"[781] Od. xii. 377, 405, 415."
14941,SECT. VII.,
14942,SECT. VII.,"2. Another instance, confirmatory of the statement of Döllinger as to"
14943,SECT. VII.,"the _rationale_ of brute-worship, is to be found in the curious passage"
14944,SECT. VII.,"of the Iliad where Xanthus, the horse of Achilles, is endowed with"
14945,SECT. VII.,"speech. The gift is from Juno, but the limit of the gift is carefully"
14946,SECT. VII.,defined[782]:

14949,SECT. VII.,
14950,SECT. VII.,αὐδήεντα δ’ ἔθηκε θεὰ λευκώλενος Ἥρη.
14951,SECT. VII.,
14952,SECT. VII.,"It was utterance that Juno gave, not intelligence. The matter to be"
14953,SECT. VII.,"spoken was not a gift. The horse proceeds, evidently by a native"
14954,SECT. VII.,"insight into the future, to intimate to Achilles his coming fate; at"
14955,SECT. VII.,first more darkly (v. 409); but when he comes nearer the point and
14956,SECT. VII.,"glances at a man as the ordained instrument of doom (416),"
14957,SECT. VII.,
14958,SECT. VII.,ἀλλὰ σοὶ αὐτῷ
14959,SECT. VII.,μόρσιμόν ἐστι θεῷ τε καὶ ἀνέρι ἶφι δαμῆναι·
14960,SECT. VII.,
14961,SECT. VII.,"then, I suppose lest the animal should proceed to particularize, and,"
14962,SECT. VII.,"though prophetic yet unwise, should break the current of the hero’s"
14963,SECT. VII.,thought and action at the critical moment by naming Paris--the Ἐρινύες
14964,SECT. VII.,"are made to interfere; they restore the order of nature, and stay the"
14965,SECT. VII.,exercise of Juno’s irregular and abnormal gift.
14966,SECT. VII.,
14967,SECT. VII.,3. The immortality of these horses is probably conceived in the same
14968,SECT. VII.,spirit. We may the more easily understand it to be a poetical rendering
14969,SECT. VII.,"of the Egyptian belief in the divinity of many animals, when we"
14970,SECT. VII.,"recollect that exemption from death is, with Homer, the one and perhaps"
14971,SECT. VII.,"only essential characteristic of deity, so that his gods are ordinarily"
14972,SECT. VII.,defined by it as ἀθάνατοι.
14973,SECT. VII.,
14974,SECT. VII.,"4. We have another indication of relation to the same ideas, in the"
14975,SECT. VII.,"assumption by deities of the forms of various birds: namely, by"
14976,SECT. VII.,"Minerva, as Od. i. 320; iii. 372; Il. vii. 59; Od. xxii. 240; by"
14977,SECT. VII.,"Apollo, Il. vii. 59; by Sleep, Il. xiv. 290; and by Ino Leucothee, Od."
14978,SECT. VII.,v. 353. In this instance we again see the refining power of the Greek
14979,SECT. VII.,imagination. It is only the forms of birds which are assumed by Homeric
14980,SECT. VII.,"deities: creatures more ethereal, though not more intellectual, than"
14981,SECT. VII.,"the other brute races; and whose figure, when assumed, at once bestows"
14982,SECT. VII.,"in visible form an attribute of high superiority to man, namely, the"
14983,SECT. VII.,increased facility and speed of locomotion.
14984,SECT. VII.,
14985,SECT. VII.,"5. One or two other traces may be suggested, but they are slighter"
14986,SECT. VII.,and more dubious. It is possible that Homer drew from this source the
14987,SECT. VII.,"Olympian horses of Juno (Il. v. 720, 768-72) and the sea-horses of"
14988,SECT. VII.,"Neptune (Il. xiii. 23). A similar notion may be involved, when the"
14989,SECT. VII.,"Poet makes Apollo stoop to feed the horses of Admetus in Pieria, and"
14990,SECT. VII.,"the oxen of Laomedon on Ida (Il. ii. 766, and xxi. 448). The serpent"
14991,SECT. VII.,"(δρακὼν) appears in Homeric portents as a symbol, but without peculiar"
14992,SECT. VII.,meaning.
14993,SECT. VII.,
14994,SECT. VII.,The horse was not one of the sacred animals of Egypt; and when Homer
14995,SECT. VII.,"placed it in such near relations with deity, as he has done in these"
14996,SECT. VII.,"places and elsewhere, he may not only have indulged a personal"
14997,SECT. VII.,"predilection, but he also may have been converting the crudity of"
14998,SECT. VII.,"Egyptian material to the form and uses of the Greek religion, in the"
14999,SECT. VII.,normal exercise of his vocation.
15000,SECT. VII.,
15001,SECT. VII.,"One concluding word may be said in extenuation of the indignity which,"
15002,SECT. VII.,"according to our ideas, attaches to the worship of the inferior"
15003,SECT. VII.,"animals. In the worship of the elemental powers we see error, but in"
15004,SECT. VII.,"the worship of beasts we see shame, and even brutality. Perhaps this"
15005,SECT. VII.,distinction may be due as much to pride as to pious susceptibility.
15006,SECT. VII.,
15007,SECT. VII.,"Over animals, man has thoroughly obtained the mastery; but Elemental"
15008,SECT. VII.,"powers are still in many cases masters over us, and we lie like babes"
15009,SECT. VII.,in the lap of their strength and vastness. It does not appear clear why
15010,SECT. VII.,"we should consider the worship of that which is more highly organized,"
15011,SECT. VII.,"and which comes half-way to intelligence, as essentially more shameful"
15012,SECT. VII.,than the worship of inferior organizations without life or instinct
15013,SECT. VII.,"of any kind. If it be said that, by its negations, inanimate Nature"
15014,SECT. VII.,"becomes a fitter shrine of deity than the brutes, the same argument"
15015,SECT. VII.,"applied to the brutes, compared with man, might equally avail to give"
15016,SECT. VII.,"claims to brute-worship as compared with anthropophuism, against which,"
15017,SECT. VII.,"notwithstanding, nature summarily revolts."

15029,SECT. VIII.,age: let us proceed to attempt a sketch of their morality; which rested
15030,SECT. VIII.,"in part upon acknowledged relations to the Olympian deities, but which,"
15031,SECT. VIII.,"it is clear, had likewise other supports and sanctions."
15032,SECT. VIII.,
15033,SECT. VIII.,"In general outline it may be thus summed up. An high spirited,"
15034,SECT. VIII.,"energetic, adventurous, and daring people, they show themselves prone"
15035,SECT. VIII.,"to acts of hasty violence, and their splendid courage occasionally even"
15036,SECT. VIII.,"degenerates, under the influence of strong passion, into ferocity,"
15037,SECT. VIII.,"while their acuteness and sagacity sometimes, though more rarely, take"
15038,SECT. VIII.,"a decided tinge of cunning. Yet they are neither selfish, cruel, nor"
15039,SECT. VIII.,"implacable. At the same time, self-command is scarcely less conspicuous"
15040,SECT. VIII.,"among them than strong, and deep, and quick emotion. They are in the"
15041,SECT. VIII.,"main a people of warm affections and high honour, commonly tender,"
15042,SECT. VIII.,never morbid: they respect the weak and the helpless; they hold
15043,SECT. VIII.,authority in reverence; domestic purity too is cherished and esteemed
15044,SECT. VIII.,"among them more than elsewhere, and they have not yet fallen into the"
15045,SECT. VIII.,depths of sensual excess.
15046,SECT. VIII.,
15047,SECT. VIII.,The Greek thanks the gods in his prosperity; witness Laertes. In his
15048,SECT. VIII.,"adversity he appeals to them for aid; or, if he is discontented, he"
15049,SECT. VIII.,complains of them; for he harbours no concealed dissatisfaction. Ready
15050,SECT. VIII.,"enough to take from those who have, he is at least as ready to give to"
15051,SECT. VIII.,those who need. He represents to the life the sentiment which another
15052,SECT. VIII.,"great master of manners has given to his Duke of Argyle, in the ‘Heart"
15053,SECT. VIII.,of Midlothian;’ ‘It is our Highland privilege to take from all what
15054,SECT. VIII.,"_we_ want, and to give to all what _they_ want[783].’ Distinctions"
15055,SECT. VIII.,"of class are recognised, but they are mild and genial: there is no"
15056,SECT. VIII.,"arrogance on the one side, nor any servility on the other. Reverence is"
15057,SECT. VIII.,"paid to those in authority; and yet the Greek thinks in the spirit, and"
15058,SECT. VIII.,"moves in the sphere, of habitual freedom. Over and above his warmth and"
15059,SECT. VIII.,"tenacity in domestic affections, he prizes highly those other special"
15060,SECT. VIII.,"relations between man and man, which mitigate and restrain the law of"
15061,SECT. VIII.,force in societies as yet imperfectly organized. He thoroughly admires
15062,SECT. VIII.,the intelligence displayed in stratagem; whether among the resources of
15063,SECT. VIII.,"self-defence, or by way of jest upon a friend, or for the hurt or ruin"
15064,SECT. VIII.,"of an enemy; but life in a mask he cannot away with, and holds it a"
15065,SECT. VIII.,"prime article of his creed, that the tongue should habitually represent"
15066,SECT. VIII.,the man[784].

15075,SECT. VIII.,"age, as to its particular sanctions, or in any of its applications to"
15076,SECT. VIII.,"the regulation of human conduct, we are met by a preliminary question:"
15077,SECT. VIII.,had the Greeks any idea of a fixed and substantive rule of morals at
15078,SECT. VIII.,all? were they believers in goodness as apart from strength? did they
15079,SECT. VIII.,"recognise a law of right as between man and man, or were their notions"
15080,SECT. VIII.,of relative duty entirely founded on a more or less far-sighted
15081,SECT. VIII.,"self-love, and on a prudential calculation of the consequences which"
15082,SECT. VIII.,"would follow to society, and to each individual, if the rights of"
15083,SECT. VIII.,others were to be held in universal or in general disregard?
15084,SECT. VIII.,
15085,SECT. VIII.,"When we consider how hard it is to keep the moral standard high, even"
15086,SECT. VIII.,after religion has placed before our view a Divine pattern for man to

15088,SECT. VIII.,"already begun to pour out its own corruption upon morals, we shall not"
15089,SECT. VIII.,venture to pitch our expectations very high: optimism and pessimism are
15090,SECT. VIII.,"here alike out of place: we want the clear, dispassionate, and direct"
15091,SECT. VIII.,"discernment of the facts. And when we observe how, down to this day,"
15092,SECT. VIII.,"the epithets which ought to designate virtue only, and in particular"
15093,SECT. VIII.,"the word _good_, tend irresistibly to attach themselves to other gifts,"
15094,SECT. VIII.,"such as genius, rank, wealth, skill, and power, we must not hastily"
15095,SECT. VIII.,"conclude, from finding a similar use in Homer, that there was no idea"
15096,SECT. VIII.,or standard of goodness except that belonging to preeminence in the
15097,SECT. VIII.,"particular kind, according to which a clever thief is a good thief;"
15098,SECT. VIII.,"good, that is, by doing effectually what he professes to do, or good,"
15099,SECT. VIII.,"like the unjust steward of the parable, in respect of the intelligence"

15126,SECT. VIII.,"is, whether the latter signification was an improvement introduced by"
15127,SECT. VIII.,"civilization into the code of barbarism, or whether it indicates a"
15128,SECT. VIII.,"principle of human nature on its better, which is also its weaker side,"
15129,SECT. VIII.,"and one which we see, all along the course of history, struggling to"
15130,SECT. VIII.,assert itself against the tyrannous invasion of other propensities and
15131,SECT. VIII.,powers.

15135,SECT. VIII.,The word ἐσθλὸς is found in combination with what is absolutely
15136,SECT. VIII.,"vicious, in the remarkable case of Autolycus:"
15137,SECT. VIII.,
15138,SECT. VIII.,"μητρὸς ἑῆς πατέρ’ ἐσθλὸν, ὃς ἀνθρώπους ἐκέκαστο"
15139,SECT. VIII.,κλεπτοσύνῃ θ’ ὅρκῳ τε[788].

15141,SECT. VIII.,[788] Od. xix. 395.
15142,SECT. VIII.,
15143,SECT. VIII.,"But the meaning of ἐσθλὸς appears to be, one who excels; the"
15144,SECT. VIII.,application of it to Autolycus is not at all unlike the commendation of
15145,SECT. VIII.,the unjust steward; and the epithet did not in the later Greek acquire
15146,SECT. VIII.,"any essentially different force, or any exclusive appropriation to"
15147,SECT. VIII.,moral excellence. Its use in Homer may be compared with his application
15148,SECT. VIII.,of δῖα to Clytemnestra. Yet it leans peculiarly to moral excellence.
15149,SECT. VIII.,"For the ἀμύμων is opposed to the ἀπηνὴς, who is certainly a moral"
15150,SECT. VIII.,"delinquent; and the highest honour of the ἀμύμων is, that men proclaim"
15151,SECT. VIII.,him ἐσθλός (Od. xix. 329-34).
15152,SECT. VIII.,
15153,SECT. VIII.,"Again, with respect to χείρων and its opposite κρείσσων, with other"
15154,SECT. VIII.,words similar to both. In searching for the signs of a standard in its
15155,SECT. VIII.,"own nature absolute, we can expect little from a class of terms, which"
15156,SECT. VIII.,by their very structure bear witness that they are simply comparative.
15157,SECT. VIII.,"Especially the etymology of χείρων, directing us to the word χεὶρ as"
15158,SECT. VIII.,"its root, exhibits force as its most commanding and essential idea."
15159,SECT. VIII.,"Yet, when the aristocracy of Ithaca are called (Od. xxi. 325) πολὺ"
15160,SECT. VIII.,"χείρονες ἄνδρες, must we not admit that even in this word there inheres"
15161,SECT. VIII.,a strong moral element?
15162,SECT. VIII.,
15163,SECT. VIII.,~_Use of the words ἀγαθὸς and κακός._~
15164,SECT. VIII.,
15165,SECT. VIII.,"But as to the words ἀγαθὸς and κακὸς, the case is far more clear: and"
15166,SECT. VIII.,"here I ask, can it be shown that Homer ever applies the word ἀγαθὸς to"
15167,SECT. VIII.,that which is morally bad? or the word κακὸς to that which is morally
15168,SECT. VIII.,"good? If it can, _cadit quæstio_; if it cannot, then we have advanced"
15169,SECT. VIII.,a considerable way in proving the ethical signification. For it is on
15170,SECT. VIII.,"all hands admitted, that besides their proper sense, ἀγαθὸς and κακὸς,"
15171,SECT. VIII.,"like our _good_ and _bad_, have a derivative meaning, in which they"
15172,SECT. VIII.,"are employed to denote what is agreeable, or what is preeminent in its"
15173,SECT. VIII.,"kind, and the reverse respectively; qualities which bear an analogy"
15174,SECT. VIII.,"to goodness on the one hand, and to badness on the other, according"
15175,SECT. VIII.,"to the universal testimony of human speech. Now, if the use of this"
15176,SECT. VIII.,"derivative sense stops short, in the case of ἀγαθὸς, when it comes to"
15177,SECT. VIII.,"border on what is positively bad, and in the case of κακὸς, when it"
15178,SECT. VIII.,"comes to touch upon what is positively good, there must be a reason"
15179,SECT. VIII.,"for the abrupt cessation, at that point, of the function of the words;"
15180,SECT. VIII.,and it can be none other than that nature herself revolts from a
15181,SECT. VIII.,"contradiction in terms; as we never say a good villain, or a bad saint."
15182,SECT. VIII.,"But the contradiction would not exist, unless the ethical sense were"
15183,SECT. VIII.,inherent in the words.
15184,SECT. VIII.,
15185,SECT. VIII.,"Now, I venture to state, with as much confidence as can well exist in"
15186,SECT. VIII.,"the case of a negative embracing such a number of instances, that we do"
15187,SECT. VIII.,"find this limitation throughout the poems of Homer, in the secondary"
15188,SECT. VIII.,use both of ἀγαθὸς and of κακός. In one passage there is at first sight
15189,SECT. VIII.,"some obscurity in the meaning of the latter term, κακὸς δ’ αἰδοῖος"
15190,SECT. VIII.,"ἀλήτης[789]. Here however the context plainly shows it to be, ‘it will"
15191,SECT. VIII.,not do for a mendicant to be shy.’
15192,SECT. VIII.,
15193,SECT. VIII.,[789] Od. xvii. 578.
15194,SECT. VIII.,
15195,SECT. VIII.,But the positive sense of both words can be clearly and indisputably
15196,SECT. VIII.,"made out from a number of passages, of which I will quote a portion."
15197,SECT. VIII.,
15198,SECT. VIII.,"Although it is true, that in Homer the word ἀγαθὸς very often refers"
15199,SECT. VIII.,"more to the ideas of particular excellences and of power, than to that"
15200,SECT. VIII.,"of moral worth; yet in some passages we find a latent bias, as it were,"
15201,SECT. VIII.,"towards the last named idea, and in others we have a clear and full"
15202,SECT. VIII.,expression of it.
15203,SECT. VIII.,
15204,SECT. VIII.,"As an example of the first, I quote the description of Agamemnon[790],"
15205,SECT. VIII.,"ἀμφότερον, βασιλεύς τ’ ἀγαθὸς κρατερός τ’ αἰχμητής, ‘A good king, and"
15206,SECT. VIII.,a brave warrior.’ Now the word ἀγαθὸς here evidently has a special
15207,SECT. VIII.,"regard to the moral element. Homer surely intends to describe, by"
15208,SECT. VIII.,"the epithets he applies to each of the two substantives, a special"
15209,SECT. VIII.,"excellence suitable to each character respectively. The goodness, so"
15210,SECT. VIII.,"to speak, of a warrior consisted in bravery: the goodness of a king,"
15211,SECT. VIII.,"partly indeed in prudence, but chiefly in justice, in mildness, and in"
15212,SECT. VIII.,liberality. If ἀγαθὸς in this place meant merely ‘good in the virtue of
15213,SECT. VIII.,"its kind,’ then it might as well stand with αἰχμητής as with βασιλεὺς,"
15214,SECT. VIII.,and therefore the antithesis would be a bad and pointless one.

15216,SECT. VIII.,[790] Il. iii. 179.
15217,SECT. VIII.,
15218,SECT. VIII.,In other cases the moral colouring of the term is full and indubitable.
15219,SECT. VIII.,"Bellerophon[791], when he resists the seduction of the wife of Prœtus,"
15220,SECT. VIII.,"is ἀγαθὰ φρονέων. Jupiter, when incensed, is described by Minerva"
15221,SECT. VIII.,"thus, φρεσὶ μαίνεται οὐκ ἀγαθῇσιν[792]. To follow good advice is ὁ"
15222,SECT. VIII.,"δὲ πείσεται εἰς ἀγαθόν περ[793]. A man who is ἀγαθὸς καὶ ἐχέφρων,"
15223,SECT. VIII.,is also the one who must necessarily have regard and affection for
15224,SECT. VIII.,"his wife[794]. And Clytemnestra, before she was corrupted, had good"

15240,SECT. VIII.,as the following. Leiodes pleads that he tried to keep the Suitors
15241,SECT. VIII.,"from doing wrong, κακῶν ἄπο χεῖρας ἔχεσθαι[796]. Telemachus warns the"

15245,SECT. VIII.,"Trojans, as κακῶν ἕταρ’ αἰὲν ἄπιστε, where our finding faithlessness in"

15261,SECT. VIII.,"the word _righteous_ among ourselves, it is derived from a source which"
15262,SECT. VIII.,"would make it immediately designate duty as between man and man, and"
15263,SECT. VIII.,also as it arises out of civil relations. But it is applied in Homer to
15264,SECT. VIII.,both the great branches of duty. And surely there cannot be a stronger
15265,SECT. VIII.,"proof of the existence of definite moral ideas among a people, than the"
15266,SECT. VIII.,very fact that they employ a word founded on the observance of relative
15267,SECT. VIII.,rights to describe also the religious character. It is when religion

15274,SECT. VIII.,"ἀνὴρ[800] δίκαιος, and the idea is that of relative duty. Again, when"
15275,SECT. VIII.,"she advises him for a while to let the Suitors alone, it is ἐπεὶ οὔτι"
15276,SECT. VIII.,νοήμονες οὐδὲ δίκαιοι[801]; and they do not know the retribution that
15277,SECT. VIII.,hangs over them. In this case the meaning must be either ‘just’ or

15297,SECT. VIII.,"omission of the usual sacrifices, while the passage has no reference"
15298,SECT. VIII.,whatever to relative duties: δίκαιος therefore must refer simply to
15299,SECT. VIII.,"duty towards the gods. And, however imperfect may be that notion of"
15300,SECT. VIII.,"divine duty which made it consist in sacrifice wholly or mainly, yet"
15301,SECT. VIII.,plainly the neglect to sacrifice was for the Greeks of the heroic age
15302,SECT. VIII.,"a moral offence, although it consisted only in the breach of a law"
15303,SECT. VIII.,of the class termed positive. A passage yet more fatally adverse to
15304,SECT. VIII.,"the position of Mr. Grote is, I think, that where Homer describes the"
15305,SECT. VIII.,Ἄβιοι[803] as δικαιότατοι ἀνθρώπων. For there he appears to be speaking
15306,SECT. VIII.,"of persons clearly less advanced in civilization, more rude, less"
15307,SECT. VIII.,"wealthy and intelligent, than the Greeks; and yet he applies to them an"
15308,SECT. VIII.,"epithet which proclaims them to have been, in his opinion, either the"

15315,SECT. VIII.,"Moreover, it does not appear that anywhere among the Greeks were"
15316,SECT. VIII.,religion and morals as yet effectually dissociated. It is true that
15317,SECT. VIII.,the language of mere mythology treats the religious character of man
15318,SECT. VIII.,"as established by bounty in sacrifice. But this is one of the points,"
15319,SECT. VIII.,"and a very vital one, in which the theistic system of the Greeks was"
15320,SECT. VIII.,"worse than their ethical instinct, and became, therefore, a positive"
15321,SECT. VIII.,source of corruption. While the Scriptures of the Old Testament rigidly
15322,SECT. VIII.,controlled the propensity of man to substitute perfunctory observances
15323,SECT. VIII.,"for the service of the heart, by saying, ‘to obey is better than"
15324,SECT. VIII.,"sacrifice,’ the Jupiter of the Greeks tells them, that to sacrifice"
15325,SECT. VIII.,is better than to obey. And it is only in the mouth of a traditive
15326,SECT. VIII.,"deity that we find any more elevated sentiment. To a certain extent,"
15327,SECT. VIII.,"indeed, yet not effectually, this representation may be qualified, if"
15328,SECT. VIII.,"we recollect that in these passages the deities of Olympus, conceived"
15329,SECT. VIII.,"according to the laws of anthropophuism, when they have occasion to"
15330,SECT. VIII.,"speak of human piety, speak of it in that aspect under which it was"
15331,SECT. VIII.,"peculiarly beneficial to themselves, but do not on that account intend"
15332,SECT. VIII.,"wholly to set aside its other parts, while they undoubtedly disturb"
15333,SECT. VIII.,the scale of relative importance in the moral order.
15334,SECT. VIII.,
15335,SECT. VIII.,"But man, the handiwork of God, was less depraved than the idols which"

15339,SECT. VIII.,"fierce, _and_ unrighteous, or, on the other, hospitable _and_ pious to"

15348,SECT. VIII.,religious observances by the Suitors in Ithaca; but Nestor and Menelaus
15349,SECT. VIII.,"are both found engaged in them. The wicked Ægisthus, having corrupted"
15350,SECT. VIII.,"Clytemnestra and gained the throne, then offered many sacrifices to the"
15351,SECT. VIII.,"gods in the hope of keeping it, and suspended many decorations in their"
15352,SECT. VIII.,"honour[805]; but he is not on this account spoken of with less horror,"
15353,SECT. VIII.,"nor indeed did this extorted profession save him from divine vengeance,"
15354,SECT. VIII.,sent by the hand of Orestes. Nor does it appear that he had ever been
15355,SECT. VIII.,"liberal in sacrifice before. The persons who are extolled, obviously"
15356,SECT. VIII.,"or expressly, on this ground in the Odyssey are, the illustrious"
15357,SECT. VIII.,"Ulysses[806], and the trusty Eumæus in his humble cottage[807]. So"
15358,SECT. VIII.,"that on the whole, as between Greek and Greek, regularity in divine"
15359,SECT. VIII.,"worship by sacrifice was neither taken for the substance of morality,"
15360,SECT. VIII.,"nor allowed as a substitute for it, but was a test of it, and was"
15361,SECT. VIII.,habitually found in union with it. The connection is clearly set out in

15378,SECT. VIII.,"profanation, abhorred by the feeling of the time, would have been"
15379,SECT. VIII.,"involved. For sacrifice, as ought to be the case with all ritual, had a"
15380,SECT. VIII.,"moral character and adjuncts. It was either ordinary, as at the common"
15381,SECT. VIII.,"meal, or solemn. In the former case the surrender by man of a portion"
15382,SECT. VIII.,"of his food was a witness to God as the giver, and an expression of"
15383,SECT. VIII.,thankfulness intelligible to an unsophisticated age. In the latter
15384,SECT. VIII.,"case, and even in the former[809], prayer or thanksgiving were commonly"
15385,SECT. VIII.,"combined with the rite. The spirit of man, when he approached the"
15386,SECT. VIII.,"altar, was bowed down before the powers of heaven; and though it was a"
15387,SECT. VIII.,heavy sin in nations who had a clear knowledge of God to lapse into the
15388,SECT. VIII.,practices of those who could but feebly grope (to use the language of

15404,SECT. VIII.,
15405,SECT. VIII.,These powers proceeded from three sources.
15406,SECT. VIII.,
15407,SECT. VIII.,"One was a regard to the gods; to their rewarding the good, and"
15408,SECT. VIII.,punishing the bad. Of this we have already treated in regard to some
15409,SECT. VIII.,of the most important points. The general proof rests upon almost every
15410,SECT. VIII.,"page of the poems, especially as regards the punishment of the unkind,"
15411,SECT. VIII.,"unjust, and cruel. The Homeric representations of a future state"
15412,SECT. VIII.,"obscurely, but sensibly, add strength to the same class of sanctions."
15413,SECT. VIII.,
15414,SECT. VIII.,"The second was the voice of conscience, speaking for each man within"

15419,SECT. VIII.,"The third was a sentiment ranging between reverence and fear, which"
15420,SECT. VIII.,"led to the performance of duty, and to the avoidance of crime, in"

15442,SECT. VIII.,"the war to strip the dead of their arms, nothing can be more unlikely"
15443,SECT. VIII.,than that the army would have resented a similar proceeding on the
15444,SECT. VIII.,part of Achilles towards Eetion. It was therefore to his own mind that
15445,SECT. VIII.,he deferred. Here there was a conscience not only taking notice of
15446,SECT. VIII.,"the broader and, so to speak, coarser, outlines of duty, but likewise"
15447,SECT. VIII.,exhibiting a refined and tender sense of it.
15448,SECT. VIII.,
15449,SECT. VIII.,"Again, Telemachus says, by way of appeal to the good feeling of the"
15450,SECT. VIII.,"Suitors themselves (Od. ii. 138.),"
15451,SECT. VIII.,
15452,SECT. VIII.,"ὑμέτερος δ’ εἰ μὲν θυμὸς νεμεσίζεται αὐτῶν,"
15453,SECT. VIII.,ἔξιτέ μοι μεγάρων.
15454,SECT. VIII.,
15455,SECT. VIII.,"In this place he seems to refer to the sense of right within each man,"
15456,SECT. VIII.,and by no means to their regard for appearances as before each other;
15457,SECT. VIII.,"while that, from which he exhorts them to abstain, is a purely moral"
15458,SECT. VIII.,"wrong. So Glaucus appears to aim at the individual conscience, when he"
15459,SECT. VIII.,impresses on Hector and the Trojans the duty of recovering the body
15460,SECT. VIII.,"of Sarpedon, lest the Myrmidons should deface his remains (Il. xvi."
15461,SECT. VIII.,"544-6). Again, Menelaus addresses a similar exhortation to the Greeks,"
15462,SECT. VIII.,and here expressly exhorts each person to feel and act for himself (Il.
15463,SECT. VIII.,"xvii. 254),"
15464,SECT. VIII.,
15465,SECT. VIII.,"ἀλλά τις αὐτὸς ἴτω, νεμεσιζέσθω δ’ ἐνὶ θυμῷ"
15466,SECT. VIII.,Πάτροκλον Τρωῇσι κυσὶν μέλπηθρα γενέσθαι.
15467,SECT. VIII.,
15468,SECT. VIII.,"In one passage particularly, Telemachus distinguishes with great"
15469,SECT. VIII.,clearness the three kinds of motive by the terms proper to them
15470,SECT. VIII.,respectively (Od. ii. 64-7);
15471,SECT. VIII.,
15472,SECT. VIII.,"(1) νεμεσσήθητε καὶ αὐτοὶ,"
15473,SECT. VIII.,"(2) ἄλλους τ’ αἰδεσθῆτε περικτίονας ἀνθρώπους,"
15474,SECT. VIII.,οἳ περιναιετάουσι· (3) θεῶν δ’ ὑποδείσατε μῆνιν.
15475,SECT. VIII.,
15476,SECT. VIII.,"That is νέμεσις, for the self-judging conscience: αἰδὼς, for human"
15477,SECT. VIII.,"opinion: and lastly, fear, in regard to the divine wrath."
15478,SECT. VIII.,
15479,SECT. VIII.,"The existence of the moral standard within a man is also, I think,"
15480,SECT. VIII.,"very strongly implied in the word ἀτασθαλίη, which is applied to deep,"
15481,SECT. VIII.,"deliberate, habitual, or audacious wickedness. For when it is intended"
15482,SECT. VIII.,"to let in any allowance for mere weakness, or for solicitation from"
15483,SECT. VIII.,"without, or for a foolish blindness, then the word ἄτη is used. And"
15484,SECT. VIII.,"I doubt whether, in any one instance throughout the poems, these two"
15485,SECT. VIII.,designations are ever applied to one and the same misconduct. It is
15486,SECT. VIII.,certainly contrary to the general and almost universal rule. The
15487,SECT. VIII.,"ἀτασθαλίη is something done with clear sight and knowledge, with the"
15488,SECT. VIII.,full and conscious action of the will: it is something regarded as
15489,SECT. VIII.,"wholly without excuse, as tending to an entire moral deadness, and as"
15490,SECT. VIII.,entailing final punishment alike without notice and without mercy.
15491,SECT. VIII.,Nothing can account for the introduction into a moral code of a form
15492,SECT. VIII.,"of offence conceived with such intensity, and ranked so high, except"
15493,SECT. VIII.,the belief that the man committing it had deliberately set aside that
15494,SECT. VIII.,"inward witness to truth and righteousness, supplied by the law of our"
15495,SECT. VIII.,"nature, in the repudiation of which the universal and consentient"
15496,SECT. VIII.,"voice of mankind has always placed the most awful responsibility, the"
15497,SECT. VIII.,extremest degree of guilt that the human being can incur.
15498,SECT. VIII.,
15499,SECT. VIII.,~_Regard for general opinion._~
15500,SECT. VIII.,
15501,SECT. VIII.,The high place assigned throughout the poems to public opinion as a
15502,SECT. VIII.,moral check is visible at every turn. And this check applies variously
15503,SECT. VIII.,"to various classes. With the most abandoned, like the Suitors, it is"
15504,SECT. VIII.,"feeble; and is only invoked on special occasions, as when Telemachus"
15505,SECT. VIII.,"combines it, in the passage lately cited, with the other moral"
15506,SECT. VIII.,sanctions. Even Paris is represented as quite beyond the reach of it:
15507,SECT. VIII.,"and Helen meekly wishes, that if the gods had determined she should"
15508,SECT. VIII.,"live, she could have been the husband of a man more open to the"
15509,SECT. VIII.,influence of the public sentiment[812]:
15510,SECT. VIII.,
15511,SECT. VIII.,[812] Il. vi. 349-51.
15512,SECT. VIII.,

15514,SECT. VIII.,
15515,SECT. VIII.,"But upon characters less frivolous and less corrupt, this power acts"
15516,SECT. VIII.,"with great efficacy: so much so, that Phœnix says he was restrained,"
15517,SECT. VIII.,"when in his passion, from killing his father by some benevolent deity,"
15518,SECT. VIII.,"whose mode of proceeding was, we shall perceive, very remarkable: for"
15519,SECT. VIII.,"the suggestion he made to Phœnix with such good effect was, not that he"
15520,SECT. VIII.,"would be punished by the gods for the offence, but that he would become"
15521,SECT. VIII.,an offence and scandal among men[813]:
15522,SECT. VIII.,
15523,SECT. VIII.,[813] Il. ix. 459-61.
15524,SECT. VIII.,
15525,SECT. VIII.,"ἀλλά τις ἀθανάτων παῦσεν χόλον, ὅς ῥ’ ἐνὶ θυμῷ"
15526,SECT. VIII.,"δήμου θῆκε φάτιν, καὶ ὀνείδεα πόλλ’ ἀνθρώπων,"
15527,SECT. VIII.,ὡς μὴ πατροφόνος μετ’ Ἀχαιοῖσιν καλεοίμην.
15528,SECT. VIII.,
15529,SECT. VIII.,"The δήμου φάτις, or public opinion, weighs even with the matron"
15530,SECT. VIII.,Penelope among the motives to her virtuous and heroic conduct; and the
15531,SECT. VIII.,"maid Nausicaa, no less circumspect than artless, finds in the φῆμις"
15532,SECT. VIII.,"ἀδευκὴς, the bitter gossip, of Scheria, an apology for desiring Ulysses"
15533,SECT. VIII.,not to enter the city in her company[814].
15534,SECT. VIII.,
15535,SECT. VIII.,[814] Od. vi. 273-7.
15536,SECT. VIII.,
15537,SECT. VIII.,But the sentiment of regard to general opinion comes out in other and
15538,SECT. VIII.,yet finer forms as a practical regulator of conduct in the heroic age.
15539,SECT. VIII.,
15540,SECT. VIII.,Perhaps we might venture to rely upon the uses of the single word
15541,SECT. VIII.,"αἰδὼς, with the cognate verb and adjective, in Homer, for proof"
15542,SECT. VIII.,that the condition of the Greeks of his age was a condition of high
15543,SECT. VIII.,"civilization, in that which constitutes its most essential part,"
15544,SECT. VIII.,"namely, that which relates to the affections and passions of man; the"
15545,SECT. VIII.,"expansion by moral forces of the one, and the compression of the other."
15546,SECT. VIII.,
15547,SECT. VIII.,"Shame, in all its many forms, has more than one pervading"
15548,SECT. VIII.,characteristic to mark it as an agent alike powerful and delicate in
15549,SECT. VIII.,its influence upon human conduct.
15550,SECT. VIII.,
15551,SECT. VIII.,"First, it essentially involves this idea: that while it refers to an"
15552,SECT. VIII.,"external standard, independent of ourselves though able to act upon"
15553,SECT. VIII.,"us, still the power thus invoked is one altogether distinct from the"
15554,SECT. VIII.,"idea of force. So sensitive indeed is the feeling of shame, that at"
15555,SECT. VIII.,"the first moment when force comes into view, it alters its nature,"
15556,SECT. VIII.,"and passes into fear. That which it apprehends is something, which"
15557,SECT. VIII.,"dwells only in the ethereal region of opinion; and yet this, by the"
15558,SECT. VIII.,"fineness of its appreciation, it converts into an agent effective both"
15559,SECT. VIII.,to excite and to restrain. Thus it exhibits to us the human spirit
15560,SECT. VIII.,"guided by silken reins, and in this way bears emphatic witness to the"
15561,SECT. VIII.,"high training, by which alone it can become susceptible of so gentle a"
15562,SECT. VIII.,guidance.
15563,SECT. VIII.,
15564,SECT. VIII.,"Secondly, it embraces not only the character of acts as they are"
15565,SECT. VIII.,"in themselves or appear to us, but also the aspect which they will"
15566,SECT. VIII.,naturally present to others. It therefore essentially involves the
15567,SECT. VIII.,"recognition of a high form of relative duty: it obliges us, in"
15568,SECT. VIII.,"regulating the whole tenour of our conduct, to make the feelings of"
15569,SECT. VIII.,others an element in our own decisions. This principle of a mutual
15570,SECT. VIII.,"regard, not confined to certain positive acts of relative duty, but"
15571,SECT. VIII.,"pervading the whole course of moral action, lies at the root of all"
15572,SECT. VIII.,genuine and high civilization.
15573,SECT. VIII.,
15574,SECT. VIII.,"Shame must have reference to some standard exterior to ourselves, and"
15575,SECT. VIII.,it therefore tends towards uprooting the law of selfishness. In one
15576,SECT. VIII.,"of its highest forms, the one perhaps most familiar to us in Homer,"
15577,SECT. VIII.,it is termed self-respect. But self-respect does not mean a regard to
15578,SECT. VIII.,self: it means a virtuous regard to a standard established by adequate
15579,SECT. VIII.,"consent and authority, and owned, not set up, by the individual"
15580,SECT. VIII.,conscience; together with a determination that ‘self’ shall be made to
15581,SECT. VIII.,conform to it.
15582,SECT. VIII.,
15583,SECT. VIII.,The φθορὰ of this sentiment is what we term false shame: which does
15584,SECT. VIII.,"evil, or refrains from good, in submission to a depraved standard of"
15585,SECT. VIII.,"opinion external to us, and in defiance of our own knowledge of right."
15586,SECT. VIII.,This kind of shame is treated with no respect in Homer: for examples
15587,SECT. VIII.,"of it we must look to Amphimachus and Leiodes, two better-minded but"
15588,SECT. VIII.,"complying Suitors, who end by perishing with the rest."
15589,SECT. VIII.,
15590,SECT. VIII.,~_The force and forms of αἰδώς._~
15591,SECT. VIII.,
15592,SECT. VIII.,The numerous forms of the sentiment of αἰδὼς in the heroic age are
15593,SECT. VIII.,a proof of the large and varied development to which it had already
15594,SECT. VIII.,attained.
15595,SECT. VIII.,
15596,SECT. VIII.,"How fine a feeling is that according to which, as with Homer, the bold"
15597,SECT. VIII.,"men are also the shamefaced ones! as in his line,"
15598,SECT. VIII.,
15599,SECT. VIII.,αἰδομένων δ’ ἀνδρῶν πλέονες σόοι ἠὲ πέφανται.
15600,SECT. VIII.,
15601,SECT. VIII.,"This line, as it is repeated, seems to have the character of a γνώμη in"
15602,SECT. VIII.,the poems[815].
15603,SECT. VIII.,
15604,SECT. VIII.,[815] Il. v. 531. xv. 563.
15605,SECT. VIII.,
15606,SECT. VIII.,The most marked and frequent use of αἰδὼς is in the sense of
15607,SECT. VIII.,self-respect as applied to military honour and bravery. The words
15608,SECT. VIII.,"αἰδὼς, Ἀργεῖοι, which are employed as an exhortation to fight,"
15609,SECT. VIII.,constitute one of the Homeric formulæ. Homer does not permit this use
15610,SECT. VIII.,of the word to the Trojans: but once it is employed for his gallant
15611,SECT. VIII.,"favourites, the Lycians. (Il. xvi. 422. xvii. 336.)"
15612,SECT. VIII.,
15613,SECT. VIII.,"Once, indeed, the term is applied to Trojans, but this is in the"
15614,SECT. VIII.,"converse of the usual sense. It would be αἰδὼς, a disgrace, says Æneas,"
15615,SECT. VIII.,were we to let Troy be taken through our want of manhood. This is a
15616,SECT. VIII.,"lower signification. And again, as we shall see, the established"
15617,SECT. VIII.,formula of military incitement for the Trojans is different and less
15618,SECT. VIII.,refined[816].
15619,SECT. VIII.,
15620,SECT. VIII.,[816] Il. vi. 112 et alibi.
15621,SECT. VIII.,
15622,SECT. VIII.,"Sometimes αἰδὼς is an excess of deference, or what we might call"
15623,SECT. VIII.,scrupulosity; the feeling which carries the fastidious observance of
15624,SECT. VIII.,some right sentiment towards others up to the point where it threatens
15625,SECT. VIII.,to interfere with a public or other clear duty. So Telemachus begs of
15626,SECT. VIII.,"Nestor, ‘tell me the truth,’"
15627,SECT. VIII.,
15628,SECT. VIII.,"μηδέ τί μ’ αἰδόμενος μειλίσσεο, μηδ’ ἐλεαίρων[817]."
15629,SECT. VIII.,
15630,SECT. VIII.,[817] Od. iii. 96.
15631,SECT. VIII.,
15632,SECT. VIII.,"In the Doloneia, Agamemnon, fearful that Diomed will choose Menelaus as"
15633,SECT. VIII.,"a companion out of deference, says, ‘Do not let αἰδὼς influence you:"
15634,SECT. VIII.,"choose the best man.’ Sometimes it is compassion, or ruth; as when"
15635,SECT. VIII.,"Achilles, before the ransom, is said to show no αἰδὼς towards the body"
15636,SECT. VIII.,of Hector. But here αἰδὼς includes the idea of shame and self-respect.
15637,SECT. VIII.,"Sometimes it is reverence towards a superior, as in Od. xiv. 505, and"
15638,SECT. VIII.,in αἰδοῖος applied by Helen to Priam in Il. iii. 172. In this manner it
15639,SECT. VIII.,becomes applicable to the sentiments a man should entertain towards the
15640,SECT. VIII.,"gods,"
15641,SECT. VIII.,
15642,SECT. VIII.,"ἀλλ’ αἰδεῖο θεοὺς, Ἀχιλεῦ[818]."
15643,SECT. VIII.,
15644,SECT. VIII.,[818] Il. xxiv. 503.
15645,SECT. VIII.,
15646,SECT. VIII.,"And this is a very remarkable use of the term, because Priam certainly"
15647,SECT. VIII.,"does not mean to urge upon Achilles a dread of the gods, but something"
15648,SECT. VIII.,quite distinct. Sometimes it is applied by a superior to an inferior;
15649,SECT. VIII.,"and means ‘his or her dues,’ as among the Immortals, where Jupiter says"
15650,SECT. VIII.,"to Thetis, that he reserves the honour of the ransom for Achilles,"
15651,SECT. VIII.,
15652,SECT. VIII.,αἰδῶ καὶ φιλότητα τεὴν μετόπισθε φυλάσσων[819].
15653,SECT. VIII.,
15654,SECT. VIII.,[819] Ibid. 111.
15655,SECT. VIII.,
15656,SECT. VIII.,It may also be felt towards an inferior among men: Agamemnon is
15657,SECT. VIII.,"exhorted to feel it towards Chryses[820], for it is not a personal"
15658,SECT. VIII.,"sentiment, but implies an object, outside the mere person who is the"
15659,SECT. VIII.,immediate occasion of it. So Achilles is intreated to revere (αἴδεσθαι)
15660,SECT. VIII.,"Lycaon, a vanquished and suppliant enemy[821]."
15661,SECT. VIII.,
15662,SECT. VIII.,[820] Il. i. 23. 377.
15663,SECT. VIII.,
15664,SECT. VIII.,[821] Il. xxi. 74.
15665,SECT. VIII.,
15666,SECT. VIII.,"Sometimes it signifies the constitution of a special relation, over and"
15667,SECT. VIII.,above the general bond between man and man. A person’s αἰδοῖοι are his
15668,SECT. VIII.,"relations, friends, guests, and the like. Even so a wanderer is αἰδοῖος"
15669,SECT. VIII.,"to the gods (Od. v. 447). Sometimes it means purely mental modesty, as"
15670,SECT. VIII.,"in Od. viii. 171, ὁ δ’ ἀσφαλέως ἀγορεύει αἰδοῖ μειλιχίῃ; he speaks with"
15671,SECT. VIII.,that engaging bashfulness and careful indication of respect for his
15672,SECT. VIII.,"audience, which forms a principal grace of the orator. Sometimes the"
15673,SECT. VIII.,"physical, as well as mental, quality of modesty; as when αἰδὼς kept the"
15674,SECT. VIII.,"goddesses at home (Od. viii. 324). Sometimes, again, simply shyness; as"
15675,SECT. VIII.,when Telemachus is exhorted by Minerva to put away αἰδὼς in Od. iii.
15676,SECT. VIII.,14; or as in the phrase κακὸς δ’ αἰδοῖος ἀλήτης; ‘it will never do for
15677,SECT. VIII.,a beggar to be shy.’
15678,SECT. VIII.,
15679,SECT. VIII.,"No finer shading of sentiment, I think, can be found in the language of"
15680,SECT. VIII.,"the most civilized nations, nor any case so remarkable of a high and"
15681,SECT. VIII.,"tender, and at the same time largely developed state of feeling at a"
15682,SECT. VIII.,"time when material progress was so partial, rude, and slight. And of"
15683,SECT. VIII.,"the vital importance of this element of the Greek moral code, we find a"
15684,SECT. VIII.,"proof in the representation of Hesiod, who gives it as a characteristic"
15685,SECT. VIII.,"of his iron, or post-Homeric, age, that αἰδὼς along with νέμεσις had"
15686,SECT. VIII.,fled from the earth.
15687,SECT. VIII.,
15688,SECT. VIII.,~_Other cognate terms._~
15689,SECT. VIII.,
15690,SECT. VIII.,"There are other words, the use of which in Homer approximates"
15691,SECT. VIII.,occasionally to the sense of αἰδώς. The nearest of them is σέβας (as
15692,SECT. VIII.,"in Il. xviii. 178), with its verb σέβομαι; which, as we have seen, is"
15693,SECT. VIII.,sometimes applied simply to an internal standard recognised by the
15694,SECT. VIII.,"conscience. But in Il. iv. 242, οὔ νυ σέβεσθε; seems to be equivalent"
15695,SECT. VIII.,to οὐκ αἰδεῖσθε; or ‘for shame.’
15696,SECT. VIII.,
15697,SECT. VIII.,"The word νέμεσις, too, is sometimes used in a sense akin to that of"
15698,SECT. VIII.,"αἰδώς: as when Neptune exhorts the Greeks, ἐν φρεσὶ θέσθε ἕκαστος αἰδῶ"
15699,SECT. VIII.,"καὶ νέμεσιν (Il. xiii. 121): compare vi. 351. Again, in Od. i. 263, ii."
15700,SECT. VIII.,"136, xxii. 40. But this sentiment is usually half way between αἰδὼς"
15701,SECT. VIII.,"and fear, because what it apprehends, though it is not force, yet"
15702,SECT. VIII.,"neither is it simple disapproval; rather it is disapproval with heat,"
15703,SECT. VIII.,"disapproval into which passion enters. It contributes, however, to"
15704,SECT. VIII.,complete a very remarkable picture of the human mind.
15705,SECT. VIII.,
15706,SECT. VIII.,"The comparison between Greeks and Trojans, or Europeans and Asiatics,"
15707,SECT. VIII.,"will prove, we shall find, greatly in favour of the former as to most"
15708,SECT. VIII.,parts of their morality. We have now to touch upon a feature in Greek
15709,SECT. VIII.,manners which is unfavourable.

15711,SECT. VIII.,~_Homicide in the heroic age._~
15712,SECT. VIII.,
15713,SECT. VIII.,"With regard to the practice of homicide, the ordinary Greek morality"
15714,SECT. VIII.,was extremely loose; while we have no evidence of a similar readiness
15715,SECT. VIII.,for bloodshedding among the Trojans: and enough is told us of Trojan
15716,SECT. VIII.,"life and manners to have probably brought out this characteristic, had"
15717,SECT. VIII.,it existed.
15718,SECT. VIII.,
15719,SECT. VIII.,"Among the Greeks, to have killed a man was considered in the light"
15720,SECT. VIII.,"of a misfortune, or at most a prudential error, an ἄτη πυκινὴ[822],"
15721,SECT. VIII.,when the perpetrator of the act had come among strangers as a fugitive
15722,SECT. VIII.,"for protection and hospitality. On the spot, therefore, where the"
15723,SECT. VIII.,"crime occurred, it could stand only as in the nature of a private"
15724,SECT. VIII.,"and civil wrong, and the fine payable was regarded, not (which it"
15725,SECT. VIII.,"might have been) as a mode, however defective, of marking any guilt"
15726,SECT. VIII.,"in the culprit, but as, on the whole, an equitable satisfaction to"
15727,SECT. VIII.,"the wounded feelings of the relatives and friends, or as an actual"
15728,SECT. VIII.,compensation for the lost services of the dead man. The religion of the
15729,SECT. VIII.,age takes no notice of the act whatever[823].

15735,SECT. VIII.,"The ordinary practice, we learn from the blunt speech of Ajax to"

15737,SECT. VIII.,"of a brother or a son, if offered, and then to let the slayer remain"
15738,SECT. VIII.,"unharmed. If he would not pay, or if the relations would not accept"
15739,SECT. VIII.,"the payment, the alternative was flight: but it does not appear that"
15740,SECT. VIII.,"this entailed any loss of character, perhaps rather otherwise. It"
15741,SECT. VIII.,"was, however, the most common issue of such an affair, and, as such,"

15769,SECT. VIII.,"is[828]; and, on finding that the youth is not in his own country, but"
15770,SECT. VIII.,"a stranger, he says, ‘So am I: I have killed a man, and am flying from"
15771,SECT. VIII.,"the vengeance of his family: they are powerful, and I am in fear lest"
15772,SECT. VIII.,they should take my life.’ Telemachus immediately promises to take
15773,SECT. VIII.,"him on board, and entertain him hospitably. He does not seem at all"
15774,SECT. VIII.,shocked at the intimation he has received. He does not think it worth
15775,SECT. VIII.,"while to ask the fugitive, whether he killed the man wantonly, or under"

15788,SECT. VIII.,"named. Tlepolemus, the son of Hercules and Astyoche, kills Licymnius"
15789,SECT. VIII.,"the maternal uncle of his father, and his own grand-uncle. The sufferer"
15790,SECT. VIII.,"is, moreover, in his old age, or he could hardly be the grand-uncle"
15791,SECT. VIII.,of an adult person; and no plea or palliation is mentioned for the
15792,SECT. VIII.,act. The children and grandchildren of Hercules prepare to levy war
15793,SECT. VIII.,upon him: but so far is he from having suffered in character for what
15794,SECT. VIII.,"hardly can have been other than a barbarous and brutal action, that he"
15795,SECT. VIII.,"is enabled to raise a large body of emigrants, who accompany him to"
15796,SECT. VIII.,"Rhodes. When distributed there in three settlements, they are blessed"
15797,SECT. VIII.,by the peculiar favour of Jupiter; and Tlepolemus appears before Troy

15803,SECT. VIII.,in the circumstance that Menœtius delivered over his son into the
15804,SECT. VIII.,"protection of Peleus, because, being a youth, he had quarrelled with"
15805,SECT. VIII.,"another youth, the son of Amphidamas, over a game of dice, and had"
15806,SECT. VIII.,"slain him, νήπιος, οὐκ ἐθέλων, as the Poet says; that is, of course,"
15807,SECT. VIII.,"without malice prepense[831]. This is the more worthy of notice,"
15808,SECT. VIII.,"because it is evident that the character of Patroclus, partly perhaps"
15809,SECT. VIII.,"for the sake of contrast with that of Achilles, and therefore of relief"
15810,SECT. VIII.,"to it, is meant to be represented as one of peculiar gentleness[832]; a"
15811,SECT. VIII.,"quality in which no one of the great Greek chieftains, except Menelaus,"

15839,SECT. VIII.,essentially dishonourable. In this account he represents himself as
15840,SECT. VIII.,"a fugitive from Crete on account of homicide. Orsilochus, the son of"
15841,SECT. VIII.,"Idomeneus, had endeavoured, as he says, to deprive him of his share"
15842,SECT. VIII.,"of the Trojan booty: for this cause he waylaid him by night, took"

15857,SECT. VIII.,on the shield of Achilles the ordinary form of public business in an
15858,SECT. VIII.,"assembly, he chooses a trial for homicide[836]. And so Ulysses, when"

15860,SECT. VIII.,"the slaughter of the Suitors, he has to contend, observes that those"

15875,SECT. VIII.,no delight in the sufferings of others. The only needless wounds are
15876,SECT. VIII.,wounds given to the dead[838]; a mode of action which imputed nothing

15888,SECT. VIII.,~_Why viewed with little disfavour._~
15889,SECT. VIII.,
15890,SECT. VIII.,"It seems as though the display of force and spirit of daring, which"
15891,SECT. VIII.,"accompany crimes of violence in a rude age, had such a value in the"
15892,SECT. VIII.,"estimation of the early Greeks, as to excuse proceedings which would"
15893,SECT. VIII.,otherwise have been visited with the severest censure. We shall find
15894,SECT. VIII.,reason to believe that Paris may have had a certain credit in their
15895,SECT. VIII.,"eyes for carrying off Helen by the strong hand, which went to redeem"
15896,SECT. VIII.,"or mitigate his adultery, and breach of hospitable rights. This idea,"
15897,SECT. VIII.,"which is undoubtedly startling, is supported by the strange narrative"
15898,SECT. VIII.,of Hercules and Iphitus. Iphitus was the possessor of certain fine
15899,SECT. VIII.,"mares. Hercules, determined to possess them, visited him, received his"
15900,SECT. VIII.,"hospitality, slew him, and carried off the animals. Now it may indeed"
15901,SECT. VIII.,"be the mixed character of Hercules, which places his εἴδωλον in the"
15902,SECT. VIII.,"Shades, while he is himself among the Immortals; but still the scale"
15903,SECT. VIII.,is cast on the whole in his favour. Yet surely the story of Iphitus
15904,SECT. VIII.,exhibits a crime of the blackest dye; and the only palliation of it
15905,SECT. VIII.,"that is conceivable seems to lie in this, that he probably did not use"
15906,SECT. VIII.,"stratagem, but proceeded by main force. The crime of Ægisthus, the"
15907,SECT. VIII.,"blackest in the poems, appears to derive its highest intensity from the"
15908,SECT. VIII.,"fact, that he slew Agamemnon like an ox at the stall, in the friendly"
15909,SECT. VIII.,"feast itself, without notice or the opportunity of defence, and by a"
15910,SECT. VIII.,plot deliberately laid. Such is the effect of all the three passages in
15911,SECT. VIII.,which this outrage is described[839]. The most favourable supposition
15912,SECT. VIII.,"which the case of Hercules admits is, that he came for plunder, and put"
15913,SECT. VIII.,"the possessor of the horses to death, without premeditation, upon his"
15914,SECT. VIII.,"refusal to yield them up; and that such an act, though a proper object"
15915,SECT. VIII.,"of divine resentment, was yet not black enough to destroy his title to"
15916,SECT. VIII.,honour and a celestial abode[840].

15922,SECT. VIII.,We will now pass on to a kindred subject.
15923,SECT. VIII.,
15924,SECT. VIII.,~_Piracy in the heroic age._~
15925,SECT. VIII.,
15926,SECT. VIII.,Thucydides has stated that in the earlier ages of Greece the practice
15927,SECT. VIII.,of piracy was alike widespread and honourable: οὐκ ἔχοντός πω αἰσχύνην
15928,SECT. VIII.,"τούτου τοῦ ἔργου, φέροντος δέ τι καὶ δόξης μᾶλλον[841]. In support"
15929,SECT. VIII.,of this opinion he refers to the questions then usually addressed to
15930,SECT. VIII.,strangers on their arrival in a country; such as that by Nestor to the
15931,SECT. VIII.,"pseudo-Mentor and Telemachus, in order to learn what their business"
15932,SECT. VIII.,"was, or whether they were pirates[842];"
15933,SECT. VIII.,
15934,SECT. VIII.,[841] Thuc. i. 5.
15935,SECT. VIII.,
15936,SECT. VIII.,[842] Od. iii. 72.
15937,SECT. VIII.,
15938,SECT. VIII.,"ἢ μαψιδίως ἀλάλησθε,"
15939,SECT. VIII.,"οἷά τε ληϊστῆρες, ὑπεὶρ ἅλα, τοίτ’ ἀλόωνται"
15940,SECT. VIII.,"ψυχὰς παρθέμενοι, κακὸν ἀλλοδαποῖσι φέροντες;"
15941,SECT. VIII.,
15942,SECT. VIII.,Now I think that the last line seems to explain the favourable view
15943,SECT. VIII.,which was taken by the Greeks of the practice of piracy. For it
15944,SECT. VIII.,"combined with the hazards of navigation, then so much more serious than"
15945,SECT. VIII.,"at present, the chance of desperate encounters. It appealed, in the"
15946,SECT. VIII.,"very highest degree, to the spirit of adventure; a spirit congenial"
15947,SECT. VIII.,"especially to the earliest youth of a people full of unsatisfied and,"
15948,SECT. VIII.,"so to speak, hungry energies. The mischief inflicted was inflicted"
15949,SECT. VIII.,"on ἀλλόδαποι, on those with whom there was no close tie, either as"
15950,SECT. VIII.,"compatriots or as ξεῖνοι. Now we must bear in mind that the law which,"
15951,SECT. VIII.,"even in the time of Thucydides, governed the relations of the Greek"
15952,SECT. VIII.,"tribes among themselves, during the period of their high civilization,"
15953,SECT. VIII.,was a permanent or ordinary state of hostility suspended from time
15954,SECT. VIII.,to time by conventions for so many or so many years[843]. The same
15955,SECT. VIII.,"principle, applied to a period when political organization was less"
15956,SECT. VIII.,"mature, and when men lived rather in knots and companies than in"
15957,SECT. VIII.,"states, involves the Homeric view of piracy. And that view, entertained"
15958,SECT. VIII.,"in such times, should occasion far less surprise, than our finding"
15959,SECT. VIII.,Thucydides inform us that the same system continued throughout whole
15960,SECT. VIII.,divisions of Greece in his day; καὶ μέχρι τοῦδε πολλὰ τῆς Ἑλλάδος
15961,SECT. VIII.,"τῷ παλαιῷ τρόπῳ νέμεται, περί τε Λοκροὺς τοὺς Ὀζόλας, καὶ Αἰτώλους,"
15962,SECT. VIII.,"καὶ Ἀκαρνᾶνας, καὶ τὴν ταύτῃ ἤπειρον[844]. The gains of the pirate’s"
15963,SECT. VIII.,life were in some sense fairly balanced by its dangers. The piracy
15964,SECT. VIII.,"of that age was not like piracy in ours, the strong and well-armed"
15965,SECT. VIII.,waiting for the feeble and defenceless; it was a game of more even
15966,SECT. VIII.,"chances, and the real resemblance for it is to be found, not among the"
15967,SECT. VIII.,"Algerine corsairs, not even in the Highland clans sweeping down from"
15968,SECT. VIII.,"the mountains upon the Lowland Scots, but most properly in the more"
15969,SECT. VIII.,even-handed forays of the border warfare between England and Scotland.
15970,SECT. VIII.,
15971,SECT. VIII.,"[843] It seems, however, possible that the sense of the ἑκατονταετεῖς"
15972,SECT. VIII.,σπονδαὶ might be the same as that which we attach to a lease for nine
15973,SECT. VIII.,hundred and ninety-nine years.

15978,SECT. VIII.,"that to which Thucydides has referred. Ulysses, when he has destroyed"
15979,SECT. VIII.,"the Suitors, considers, in conversation with his wife, not only how he"
15980,SECT. VIII.,"is to preserve his remaining property in live stock, but how he is to"
15981,SECT. VIII.,replace what his enemies have destroyed. Part he thinks his subjects
15982,SECT. VIII.,"will make up to him by presents, but great part he will himself obtain"

15991,SECT. VIII.,"Cicones, piracy is scarcely distinguishable from war; but Ulysses"
15992,SECT. VIII.,"fairly relates of himself a piratical attack upon Egypt, which can"
15993,SECT. VIII.,"leave us no room for scruple in supposing, that he might without"
15994,SECT. VIII.,hesitation think of doing again what he thought it worth while to
15995,SECT. VIII.,pretend that he had done before. Both these last-named instances may
15996,SECT. VIII.,"serve, however, to show that, in times when preparedness for war was"
15997,SECT. VIII.,"habitual, the pirate took no great advantage in such attacks as these."
15998,SECT. VIII.,For with the Cicones Ulysses had the worst of it at last[846]; and in
15999,SECT. VIII.,"the case of Egypt, according to his fable, the whole party were taken"
16000,SECT. VIII.,"prisoners or slain. Kidnapping, however, such as that of Eumæus stolen"
16001,SECT. VIII.,"in his childhood, is not, I presume, to be regarded as equal in honour"
16002,SECT. VIII.,"to freebooting with the strong hand, thus apparently stamped with the"

16027,SECT. VIII.,"is mentioned as an act of ὕβρις, an outrage deservedly punished by"
16028,SECT. VIII.,"Jupiter[849]. On the other hand, Greek trade, like Phœnician, embraced"

16040,SECT. VIII.,"well as to trade, which we regard as in itself both innocent and"
16041,SECT. VIII.,"beneficial. Since Homer’s time the character of war has been softened,"
16042,SECT. VIII.,"and that of trade has been elevated, almost immeasurably; while that of"

16069,SECT. VIII.,"a people of the strong and the red hand, marvellously combined with"
16070,SECT. VIII.,"high refinement, true love of art and song, and an unexampled political"
16071,SECT. VIII.,genius.
16072,SECT. VIII.,
16073,SECT. VIII.,But although the Homeric age had not ceased to be as yet an age of
16074,SECT. VIII.,"violence, it was as far as possible from being one marked by a general"
16075,SECT. VIII.,"sway either of unbridled appetite, or of ungovernable passion; and if"
16076,SECT. VIII.,"it is sometimes mistakenly supposed to have borne this character, the"
16077,SECT. VIII.,"appearances which produce the illusion are due only to the fact, that"
16078,SECT. VIII.,"vice of all kinds then went straight forward to its work, and had not"
16079,SECT. VIII.,"yet learned, in the school of the wisdom of this world, how much it"
16080,SECT. VIII.,"might gain from method, order, and reserve."
16081,SECT. VIII.,
16082,SECT. VIII.,~_Temperance in the heroic age._~
16083,SECT. VIII.,
16084,SECT. VIII.,"We have ample signs of that regard for temperance, bodily as well as"
16085,SECT. VIII.,"mental, which Homer united with his thoroughly convivial spirit. By"
16086,SECT. VIII.,"the mouth of Ulysses, he reprehends even that mild form of excess in"
16087,SECT. VIII.,wine which does no more than promote garrulity (Od. xiv. 463-6). When
16088,SECT. VIII.,"the Greeks were about to suffer great calamities on their return, he"
16089,SECT. VIII.,makes them proceed in a state of drunkenness to the Assembly[851].
16090,SECT. VIII.,"When Elpenor dies by an accidental fall, he assigns drunkenness as"
16091,SECT. VIII.,"the cause, and takes care to inform us that he was young, and neither"
16092,SECT. VIII.,valiant nor sensible[852]. Ulysses encourages the brutal Polyphemus
16093,SECT. VIII.,"to drink, with a view to his own liberation. And the proceedings of"
16094,SECT. VIII.,"the monster, when intoxicated, are certainly more revolting than"
16095,SECT. VIII.,"those of Stephano, if not than those of Caliban, in the Tempest."
16096,SECT. VIII.,"Again, though it is certainly true, that the most vivid denunciation"
16097,SECT. VIII.,of excess in liquor to be found throughout the poems is put into the
16098,SECT. VIII.,"mouth of the Suitor Antinous[853], yet I think it was plainly meant"
16099,SECT. VIII.,"to be accepted as spoken in earnest, and as expressing the sense of"
16100,SECT. VIII.,"Homer. Wine, we thus learn, caused the Centaur Eurytion to lose his"
16101,SECT. VIII.,ears and nose. In no single case does the Poet permit liquor to act
16102,SECT. VIII.,"in the slightest degree upon the self-possession of his heroes, or"
16103,SECT. VIII.,"of any character whom he esteems; or represent them as either doing,"
16104,SECT. VIII.,"or leaving undone, any act through excess in drink[854]. The only"
16105,SECT. VIII.,"allusion to its influence, in connection with a practical result, is"
16106,SECT. VIII.,"one very faint, and perfectly innocent. It is when, dissatisfaction"
16107,SECT. VIII.,"having prevailed among the Grecian kings and army, as we see from the"
16108,SECT. VIII.,"speech of Diomed, Nestor recommends Agamemnon to treat his Council to a"
16109,SECT. VIII.,"supper, before proceeding to obtain their advice; and observes to him,"
16110,SECT. VIII.,"that he can readily do it, for he has wine and all other provision in"
16111,SECT. VIII.,"abundance. The intention apparently is to lay the ground for concord,"
16112,SECT. VIII.,"not in excess, nor even here in hilarity, but at least in amicable"
16113,SECT. VIII.,"humour[855]. To the Immortals, indeed, it is conceded to abide at the"
16114,SECT. VIII.,"banquet for the livelong day, but not to men; for the pseudo-Mentor"
16115,SECT. VIII.,"observes to Nestor in the Third Odyssey, that it is not seemly to sit"
16116,SECT. VIII.,"long at the sacred (that is, regular and public) feast[856]."

16145,SECT. VIII.,
16146,SECT. VIII.,"When we turn to another form of temperance or self-government, namely,"
16147,SECT. VIII.,"that which we call self-control, we find it eminently exemplified"
16148,SECT. VIII.,among Greeks. It appears as a pervading and national quality in that
16149,SECT. VIII.,"silence on the field of battle, which they combined with such an inward"
16150,SECT. VIII.,energy of determination. In Ulysses it is carried up to its perfection.
16151,SECT. VIII.,Perhaps the only occasions on which he even seems to relax it are those
16152,SECT. VIII.,"of the answer to Euryalus in the Eighth Odyssey, and the reply to"
16153,SECT. VIII.,Agamemnon in the Fourth Iliad.
16154,SECT. VIII.,
16155,SECT. VIII.,"So much, however, of emotion as he suffers to escape him in those"
16156,SECT. VIII.,"passages, only serves to heighten the effect of his words, not to make"
16157,SECT. VIII.,"him deflect by one jot or tittle, though in undoubted warmth, from"
16158,SECT. VIII.,the true rule of reason. But we find this quality not only developed
16159,SECT. VIII.,powerfully in a pattern-man like Ulysses; it is also strongly infused
16160,SECT. VIII.,into such a warrior as Diomed. This is proved by the manner in which
16161,SECT. VIII.,"he bears[858] the chiding of Agamemnon on his rounds, and rebukes"
16162,SECT. VIII.,Sthenelus for having been provoked into a petulant answer. At the
16163,SECT. VIII.,"same time it is highly illustrative of the national character, that"
16164,SECT. VIII.,"this young and ardent warrior, who could thus bear a reprimand on"
16165,SECT. VIII.,"the field, stored up the recollection of it within his breast: and"
16166,SECT. VIII.,"when, at the beginning of the Ninth Book, Agamemnon showed his own"
16167,SECT. VIII.,"faint-heartedness by advising the abandonment of the enterprise, then"
16168,SECT. VIII.,"Diomed, having watched his opportunity, recalled the circumstances, and"
16169,SECT. VIII.,"quietly but effectively replied upon Agamemnon[859]. Nay more, perhaps"
16170,SECT. VIII.,the most striking proof of the abundance of this high quality among
16171,SECT. VIII.,the Greeks is in the very case where it is on the whole outmatched by
16172,SECT. VIII.,"the passion that it ought to master, namely, in the case of Achilles."
16173,SECT. VIII.,"There is something indeed sublime in the manner in which, many times"
16174,SECT. VIII.,"over, when he feels the tide of wrath rising within him, he eyes his"
16175,SECT. VIII.,"own passion, even as a tiger is eyed by its keeper, and puts a spell"
16176,SECT. VIII.,"upon it, so that it dare not spring. Thus it is, when he parleys with"
16177,SECT. VIII.,"himself on the question, whether he shall end the strife with Agamemnon"
16178,SECT. VIII.,"by slaying him, in the Assembly of the First Book. And thus again,"
16179,SECT. VIII.,when he feels that the words which Priam has incautiously let drop
16180,SECT. VIII.,"are kindling a flame which, if further fed, would consume the aged"
16181,SECT. VIII.,"and sorrowing suppliant, he is conscious of the rising tempest, and"
16182,SECT. VIII.,"before it has swollen to such force as to disturb his self-command, he"
16183,SECT. VIII.,"sternly, but yet not unkindly, bids him to desist. It is by trying them"
16184,SECT. VIII.,"in mental conflicts like these, that Homer shows us of what mettle his"
16185,SECT. VIII.,Greek kings were made. It would be curious to draw out a list of the
16186,SECT. VIII.,"multitude of words in which he describes, under every possible aspect,"
16187,SECT. VIII.,the power and habit of self-control. But perhaps one of his slightest
16188,SECT. VIII.,is also one of his most effective touches. The applause of the Greeks
16189,SECT. VIII.,in their Assembly is always described by a word different from that
16190,SECT. VIII.,employed to describe the very same indication of feeling by the
16191,SECT. VIII.,Trojans. He usually says ἐπὶ δ’ ἴαχον υἷες Ἀχαιῶν for the Greeks: for
16192,SECT. VIII.,the Trojans it is ἐπὶ δὲ Τρῶες κελάδησαν. The Greeks shout forth their
16193,SECT. VIII.,"energetic approval: the Trojans clatter, as if their tongues could not"
16194,SECT. VIII.,bear restraint.

16199,SECT. VIII.,
16200,SECT. VIII.,"Yet we must not suppose, either on account of the self-command of"
16201,SECT. VIII.,"the Greeks that they were apathetic, or on account of their frequent"
16202,SECT. VIII.,"homicides that they were inhuman, and savagely indifferent to the"
16203,SECT. VIII.,infliction of pain on their fellow-creatures.
16204,SECT. VIII.,
16205,SECT. VIII.,Neither the Greeks nor the Trojans appear to have been ferocious in
16206,SECT. VIII.,the treatment of enemies. The extreme point to which they go is that
16207,SECT. VIII.,"of giving no quarter: but they never, even in the exasperation of"
16208,SECT. VIII.,"battle, inflict torture with their weapons. The immolation of twelve"
16209,SECT. VIII.,Trojan youths over the dead Patroclus is doubtless cruel: but it falls
16210,SECT. VIII.,far short of what the passions of war have produced in other times and
16211,SECT. VIII.,"countries. With the manner of inflicting death, passion never has to do."

16214,SECT. VIII.,
16215,SECT. VIII.,"An inquiry, however, which seems to be most curious, is suggested by"
16216,SECT. VIII.,"the passages in which Hecuba wishes that she could eat Achilles[860],"
16217,SECT. VIII.,Achilles that he could find it in his heart to devour Hector[861];
16218,SECT. VIII.,"and again in which Jupiter[862] suggests to Juno, that nothing could"
16219,SECT. VIII.,satiate her spite against Troy so well as if she were to eat up Priam
16220,SECT. VIII.,"and his whole family. For the question arises, how is it that we find"
16221,SECT. VIII.,these remains of the wildest savagery in company with a refinement of
16222,SECT. VIII.,"manners and feeling, which the poems very frequently exhibit, and which"
16223,SECT. VIII.,even reaches in some important points to a degree never exceeded in any
16224,SECT. VIII.,country or any period of the world?

16231,SECT. VIII.,
16232,SECT. VIII.,The answer I presume to be this: that the civilization of the Greeks
16233,SECT. VIII.,"in the heroic age, though as to the mind it was really a very high,"
16234,SECT. VIII.,was yet also a very young civilisation. Its path was marked and
16235,SECT. VIII.,"decided, but it had not had time to travel far from barbarism. It was"
16236,SECT. VIII.,"not safe by distance, nor defended by the ramparts of long tradition,"
16237,SECT. VIII.,"nor strengthened by the force of continuing bent, and consolidated"
16238,SECT. VIII.,"immemorial habit. The Homeric gentleman, with his civilization, stood,"
16239,SECT. VIII.,"in respect to barbarism, like him who voyages by sea,"
16240,SECT. VIII.,
16241,SECT. VIII.,digitis a morte remotus
16242,SECT. VIII.,Quatuor aut septem;
16243,SECT. VIII.,
16244,SECT. VIII.,only the thickness of the plank is between him and the wilderness which
16245,SECT. VIII.,"he has left: and if passion makes a breach, the mood of the wild beast"
16246,SECT. VIII.,reappears. We may account for the cannibalish observation of Jupiter by
16247,SECT. VIII.,the fact that he has no self-control in Homer: but that of Hecuba is to
16248,SECT. VIII.,be accounted for on the principle I have endeavoured to describe. So
16249,SECT. VIII.,"it is with Achilles: and so, too, when the wise Ulysses, slaughtering"
16250,SECT. VIII.,"the wretched women of his household who had erred, seems tinged for"
16251,SECT. VIII.,once with a flush of barbarism. When _we_ let loose the tiger within
16252,SECT. VIII.,"us, his range is limited not by any force springing from our own will"
16253,SECT. VIII.,"or choice, but by the strong dikes and barriers of social wont, and by"
16254,SECT. VIII.,"habits of thought as well as action, which have been accumulated by the"
16255,SECT. VIII.,long labours of many successive generations of mankind.
16256,SECT. VIII.,
16257,SECT. VIII.,We have already[863] noticed something that will well bear comparison
16258,SECT. VIII.,with this state of things in the reports which are made to us
16259,SECT. VIII.,"respecting modern Persia, the cradle in all likelihood of the family of"
16260,SECT. VIII.,Achilles.
16261,SECT. VIII.,
16262,SECT. VIII.,"[863] Achæis or Ethnology, sect. x. p. 570."
16263,SECT. VIII.,
16264,SECT. VIII.,"At the same time it is to be borne in mind that this cannibalism,"
16265,SECT. VIII.,"of which we have glimpses in Homer, in the first place was limited,"
16266,SECT. VIII.,"even in speculation, to enemies; and in the second place, existed in"
16267,SECT. VIII.,speculation only. Of this we have pretty strong proof from the case
16268,SECT. VIII.,of the crew of Ulysses in the Twelfth Odyssey. They did not touch the
16269,SECT. VIII.,"oxen of the Sun, until death from hunger stared them in the face. Then"
16270,SECT. VIII.,Eurylochus made a manful speech on the subject of the option before
16271,SECT. VIII.,"them, between dying on the one side, and the slaughter of some of the"
16272,SECT. VIII.,"animals on the other. But those circumstances of the last extremity,"
16273,SECT. VIII.,"to which they were reduced, were the very circumstances in which the"
16274,SECT. VIII.,"fortitude even of Christians[864] has given way, and with respect to"
16275,SECT. VIII.,which no prudent man dares to pronounce a judgment upon persons that so
16276,SECT. VIII.,succumb. Yet there is not in the case before us the slightest hint at
16277,SECT. VIII.,a resort to this most horrible remedy.

16282,SECT. VIII.,
16283,SECT. VIII.,I am free to own that I cannot dismiss from my mind the suspicion that
16284,SECT. VIII.,what the poet means to convey to us in these darkly veiled expressions
16285,SECT. VIII.,"is the devouring of the wretched children by their parent. (Inferno,"
16286,SECT. VIII.,xxxiii. 75.)
16287,SECT. VIII.,
16288,SECT. VIII.,~_Not unfamiliar to later Greece._~
16289,SECT. VIII.,
16290,SECT. VIII.,"Besides the circumstance, that in Homer the cannibal _dicta_,"
16291,SECT. VIII.,"abstractedly so shocking, are the mere words of phrensied passion, and"
16292,SECT. VIII.,"that there are no corresponding acts, we have to observe that the Poet"
16293,SECT. VIII.,is never found exhibiting the sentiment of joy in connection with the
16294,SECT. VIII.,positive infliction of suffering upon an enemy. It was by no means so
16295,SECT. VIII.,"among the later Greeks. Too many instances might, indeed, be supplied"
16296,SECT. VIII.,of the increase of cruelty with the lapse of time.
16297,SECT. VIII.,
16298,SECT. VIII.,"Homer, again, has nowhere made woman to be even the sorrowing minister"
16299,SECT. VIII.,of justice: as if he felt that there was a radical incompatibility
16300,SECT. VIII.,"between the proper gentleness of her nature, and the use of the sword"
16301,SECT. VIII.,"of punishment. But in the Hecuba of Euripides, after the aged matron,"
16302,SECT. VIII.,"exasperated by the treacherous murder of her son Polydorus, has put to"
16303,SECT. VIII.,"death the two children of the assassin Polymestor, and has likewise put"
16304,SECT. VIII.,"out his eyes, he addresses to her these words (v. 1233),"
16305,SECT. VIII.,
16306,SECT. VIII.,"χαίρεις ὑβρίζουσ’ εἰς ἔμ’, ὦ πανοῦργε σύ·"
16307,SECT. VIII.,
16308,SECT. VIII.,"and she, no way shrinking from the imputation, replies"
16309,SECT. VIII.,
16310,SECT. VIII.,"οὐ γάρ με χαίρειν χρὴ, σὲ τιμωρουμένην;"
16311,SECT. VIII.,
16312,SECT. VIII.,"In one place Homer has taken an opportunity of showing us, what he"
16313,SECT. VIII.,thinks of the principle of exultation over fallen enemies. When
16314,SECT. VIII.,"Euryclea is about to shout over the fallen Suitors, Ulysses, though he"
16315,SECT. VIII.,"has not yet ended the bloody work of retribution, gravely checks her."
16316,SECT. VIII.,"‘It is wrong,’ he says, ‘to exult over the slain. These men have been"
16317,SECT. VIII.,"overtaken by divine providence, and by their own perverse deeds: for"
16318,SECT. VIII.,"they regarded no human being, noble or vile, with whom they had to do:"
16319,SECT. VIII.,wherefore they have miserably perished in their wickedness.’ The whole
16320,SECT. VIII.,"tone and language of this rebuke, so grave and earnest as it is, and"
16321,SECT. VIII.,"more sad even than it is stern, is worthy of any moral code that the"
16322,SECT. VIII.,world has known.
16323,SECT. VIII.,
16324,SECT. VIII.,~_Wrath in Ulysses and in Achilles._~
16325,SECT. VIII.,
16326,SECT. VIII.,There is indeed a terrible severity in the proceedings of Ulysses
16327,SECT. VIII.,"against the Suitors, the women, and his rebellious subjects. But"
16328,SECT. VIII.,"it is plain that the case, which Homer had to represent, was one"
16329,SECT. VIII.,that required the hero to effect something like a reconquest of the
16330,SECT. VIII.,country. It is also plain that Homer felt that these stern measures
16331,SECT. VIII.,"would require a very strong warrant. Hence without doubt it is, that"
16332,SECT. VIII.,the preparations for the crisis are so elaborate; the insults offered
16333,SECT. VIII.,to the disguised master of the palace so aggravated; and the direct
16334,SECT. VIII.,"agency of Minerva introduced to deepen his sufferings. Hence, again,"
16335,SECT. VIII.,when the incensed warrior is about to pursue with martial ardour the
16336,SECT. VIII.,"flying insurgents, his eagerness is mildly marked as excessive, and"
16337,SECT. VIII.,is effectually checked by the friendly but decisive intervention of
16338,SECT. VIII.,"Jupiter. Some critics have objected to this passage, and have argued"
16339,SECT. VIII.,"that it could not be genuine. They surely must forget, that Homer does"
16340,SECT. VIII.,not seek to present us in his protagonists with a faultlessness which
16341,SECT. VIII.,"would have carried them out of the sphere, such as it was conceived"
16342,SECT. VIII.,"by him and by his age, of life either divine or human. Both Ulysses"
16343,SECT. VIII.,"and Achilles may err. But where they err, it is in measure and degree."
16344,SECT. VIII.,"Ulysses is the minister of public justice, and of divine retribution."
16345,SECT. VIII.,"But he is composed, like ourselves, of flesh and blood, and he carries"
16346,SECT. VIII.,"his righteous office, in a natural heat, to the verge of cruelty. Then"
16347,SECT. VIII.,"the warning voice is vouchsafed to him, and he at once dutifully obeys."
16348,SECT. VIII.,"And is, then, a thing like this so new and strange to us? And has"
16349,SECT. VIII.,neither our philosophy nor our experience of life taught us that there
16350,SECT. VIII.,"are no circumstances, in which a good and just man runs so serious a"
16351,SECT. VIII.,"risk of becoming harsh and cruel unawares, as when he is hurried along"
16352,SECT. VIII.,by the torrent of an originally righteous indignation?
16353,SECT. VIII.,
16354,SECT. VIII.,"Even so with Achilles. He is, no more than Ulysses, merely vengeful,"
16355,SECT. VIII.,"but he resents a wrong done to justice, to decency, and to love, in"
16356,SECT. VIII.,"his person. Upon the stream of this resentment he is carried, until"
16357,SECT. VIII.,"it threatens to become a torrent. Then, by an admirable design, he is"
16358,SECT. VIII.,"chastised in the yet deeper passion of his soul, his friendship for"
16359,SECT. VIII.,Patroclus; and so is recalled within the bounds of his duty to his
16360,SECT. VIII.,suffering countrymen.
16361,SECT. VIII.,
16362,SECT. VIII.,But in both cases the foundation of conduct is just and sound: by
16363,SECT. VIII.,neither is any sanction given to the principle which the Gospel
16364,SECT. VIII.,"rebukes, ‘an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.’ For a wrong done"
16365,SECT. VIII.,to principles of public morality and justice is in each case alike the
16366,SECT. VIII.,"thing chiefly resented, although in each case the person who resents it"
16367,SECT. VIII.,is also a person that had greatly suffered by it.
16368,SECT. VIII.,
16369,SECT. VIII.,"Again, we should misunderstand Homer’s picture of the Greek character,"
16370,SECT. VIII.,if we conceived that he left no room in it for those accesses of
16371,SECT. VIII.,"emotion, with respect to which it may be difficult to say whether they"
16372,SECT. VIII.,"contributed most to its strength or its weakness, while it seems clear"
16373,SECT. VIII.,that they are in near association with both.
16374,SECT. VIII.,
16375,SECT. VIII.,The Poet’s intention does not oblige him to place his protagonists
16376,SECT. VIII.,"beyond the reach of human infirmity, as we see in the stubborn wrath"
16377,SECT. VIII.,"of Achilles, and in the awakened keenness of Ulysses for the blood of"
16378,SECT. VIII.,his rebellious subjects[865]. And though he never exhibits them as
16379,SECT. VIII.,"vicious, still, in the case of Ulysses, as well as in that of Achilles,"
16380,SECT. VIII.,"he has introduced into his picture great quickness of temper, which is"
16381,SECT. VIII.,"indeed nearly, though not necessarily, connected with sensitiveness"
16382,SECT. VIII.,of honour. On two occasions in particular is this observable: in the

16396,SECT. VIII.,The point in which the ethical tone of the heroic age stands highest of
16397,SECT. VIII.,"all is, perhaps, the strength of the domestic affections."
16398,SECT. VIII.,
16399,SECT. VIII.,A marked indication of the power of this principle among mankind is
16400,SECT. VIII.,to be found in its prevalence even among the Olympian deities. For
16401,SECT. VIII.,its appearance there has no relation to divine attributes properly so
16402,SECT. VIII.,called; it is strictly a part of the mythology; a sentiment copied
16403,SECT. VIII.,"from the human heart and life, and transferred to these inventive or"
16404,SECT. VIII.,idealized formations. Indeed we always find it in connection with that
16405,SECT. VIII.,"in which they are most human, namely, the indulgence of their sensual"
16406,SECT. VIII.,"passions, and the results of that indulgence in their human progeny. It"
16407,SECT. VIII.,"is not, therefore, among the higher or traditive deities that we find"
16408,SECT. VIII.,"the sentiment; it does not exist in Apollo or Minerva, whose love is"
16409,SECT. VIII.,"always of a different kind, and is grounded in the gifts or character"
16410,SECT. VIII.,"of the person who is the object of it, as for instance, the great"
16411,SECT. VIII.,"Ulysses[868], or, in a smaller sphere, the skilful Phereclus, who built"
16412,SECT. VIII.,"the ships of Paris[869]. It is in Jupiter over Sarpedon, in Neptune for"
16413,SECT. VIII.,"the blindness of his brutal son Polyphemus, in Mars over Ascalaphus,"
16414,SECT. VIII.,in Venus about Æneas; and these two last are the two deities whose
16415,SECT. VIII.,ethical and intellectual standard is the lowest of all[870].

16423,SECT. VIII.,"When we come down to earth, we find the sentiment strong everywhere."
16424,SECT. VIII.,"Among the Trojan royal family, where there is but little sense of the"
16425,SECT. VIII.,"higher parts of morality, this feeling is intense alike with Priam"
16426,SECT. VIII.,"and with Hecuba. The latter is not passionate, she is ἠπιόδωρος[871]."

16430,SECT. VIII.,"indeed that, then as now, the imperiousness of bodily wants made itself"
16431,SECT. VIII.,"felt; and it was then more ingenuously acknowledged. Hence Telemachus,"
16432,SECT. VIII.,"attached to his father, when he explained the double cause of his grief"
16433,SECT. VIII.,"and care to the Ithacan assembly, first named the death or absence of"
16434,SECT. VIII.,"his father, but then proclaimed as the chief matter, the continuing"

16449,SECT. VIII.,"urging Penelope to marry, but their living upon him while prosecuting"
16450,SECT. VIII.,"the suit[875]. But then this is a father, whom he has never known or"
16451,SECT. VIII.,consciously seen. The Shade of Achilles in the nether world is anxious
16452,SECT. VIII.,upon one subject: it is that he may know if old Peleus is still held
16453,SECT. VIII.,in honour. In another he is also deeply interested; it is the valour
16454,SECT. VIII.,of his son: and the gloom of his chill existence is brightened into an
16455,SECT. VIII.,"exulting joy, when he learns that Neoptolemus is great in fight[876]."
16456,SECT. VIII.,"The mother of Ulysses died neither of disease nor of old age, but of"
16457,SECT. VIII.,a broken heart for the absence of her son[877]. But the most signal
16458,SECT. VIII.,proof of the power of the instinct is in its hold upon the self-centred
16459,SECT. VIII.,"character of Agamemnon, which, as a general rule, leaves no room in"
16460,SECT. VIII.,"his thoughts for anything, except policy alone, that lies beyond the"
16461,SECT. VIII.,range of his personal propensities and especially his appetite for
16462,SECT. VIII.,"wealth. But when the gallant Menelaus, ashamed of the silence of his"
16463,SECT. VIII.,"countrymen, accepts the challenge of Hector[878], Agamemnon seizes"
16464,SECT. VIII.,"him by the hand, and beseeches him not to run so terrible a hazard."

16467,SECT. VIII.,"him to take not the man of highest rank, but the most valiant and"
16468,SECT. VIII.,effective companion for an enterprise of so critical a kind. His motive
16469,SECT. VIII.,was apprehension for the safety of his brother[879]:

16516,SECT. VIII.,"This marked line of distinction, between the homicides of crime"
16517,SECT. VIII.,"and the homicides of misfortune, illustrates another point in the"
16518,SECT. VIII.,structure of Greek society. Relationships do not appear to have been
16519,SECT. VIII.,reckoned by them as subsisting beyond a rather narrow range. We cannot
16520,SECT. VIII.,trace any defined idea of kin more remote than the first cousin. The
16521,SECT. VIII.,lexicographers treat the term ἀνέψιος as capable of a wider sense; but
16522,SECT. VIII.,"the only individuals named as ἀνέψιοι by Homer, whose relationships"
16523,SECT. VIII.,"we can follow, are first cousins: namely, Caletor son of Clytius, and"
16524,SECT. VIII.,"Dolops son of Lampus, both first cousins of Hector[883]. There are also"
16525,SECT. VIII.,"persons named in the poems, whose consanguinity we can trace, while it"
16526,SECT. VIII.,"is nowhere noticed by the Poet: for instance, Eumelus is first cousin,"
16527,SECT. VIII.,"once removed, to Nestor. Priam and Anchises are second cousins: Æneas"
16528,SECT. VIII.,and Hector third. These relationships are never referred to. Thus
16529,SECT. VIII.,"then society is not arranged in clans, but in tribes, united by the"
16530,SECT. VIII.,"general sense of a common name, a common abode, a common history, a"
16531,SECT. VIII.,"common religion, and a remote sense of a common tribal stock, without"
16532,SECT. VIII.,"any sense of personal affinity in each individual case. Again, it is"
16533,SECT. VIII.,curious to observe that the xenial relation was not less vivacious
16534,SECT. VIII.,than that of blood. The tie of blood subsists in the second generation
16535,SECT. VIII.,from the common ancestor; and Diomed and Glaucus similarly own one
16536,SECT. VIII.,"another as ξεῖνοι, because two generations before Œneus had entertained"

16544,SECT. VIII.,
16545,SECT. VIII.,The elevated and free social position of womankind in the Homeric
16546,SECT. VIII.,times of itself implies a great purity of ideas respecting them. This
16547,SECT. VIII.,"subject, however, will receive a separate discussion."
16548,SECT. VIII.,
16549,SECT. VIII.,There is a passage of Athenæus which conveys to us a tradition of
16550,SECT. VIII.,"no ordinary beauty, and effectually severs for us ideas and objects"
16551,SECT. VIII.,which only a corrupt bias has associated. He tells us that Zeno of
16552,SECT. VIII.,"Citium[885], whatever the practice of the Stoic leader may have been,"
16553,SECT. VIII.,"conceived of Ἔρως, the God of Love, as a deity of friendship, liberty,"
16554,SECT. VIII.,"concord, and public happiness, and of nothing else. So likewise his"
16555,SECT. VIII.,antecessors in philosophy taught that this deity was as a being
16556,SECT. VIII.,perfectly pure: σεμνόν τινα καὶ παντὸς αἰσχροῦ κεχωρισμένον. This idea
16557,SECT. VIII.,"took refuge in the Venus Οὐρανία, the opposite one in the Πάνδημος, or"
16558,SECT. VIII.,"promiscuous[886]. In the later ages of Greece, the distinction of these"
16559,SECT. VIII.,two characters one from the other feebly lived on: but there was no
16560,SECT. VIII.,"subjective basis for the separate existence of the former, and it was"
16561,SECT. VIII.,"practically eclipsed, if not absorbed. The true severance of the ideas"
16562,SECT. VIII.,probably was effected before the time of Homer; and they were lodged
16563,SECT. VIII.,in separate impersonations. The effective form of the Celestial Venus
16564,SECT. VIII.,"is to be sought most probably in Diana, though it was natural for Plato"
16565,SECT. VIII.,and the philosophers to keep alive the memory of the distinction by
16566,SECT. VIII.,way of apology for the popular religion. The traces of this unstained
16567,SECT. VIII.,"conception were in later times only to be found in the sphere of art,"
16568,SECT. VIII.,"and were even there not always visible: but in the Homeric poems, and"
16569,SECT. VIII.,"probably in the Homeric period, this purity of admiring sentiment"
16570,SECT. VIII.,towards beautiful form appears to have been a living reality.

16593,SECT. VIII.,"connection with the morals either of the Poet himself, or of the age to"
16594,SECT. VIII.,which he belonged.
16595,SECT. VIII.,
16596,SECT. VIII.,"Of these the most important, in my view, is the tendency which the"
16597,SECT. VIII.,Pagan religion already powerfully showed to become itself the positive
16598,SECT. VIII.,"corrupter of morality, or, to speak perhaps more accurately, to"
16599,SECT. VIII.,"afford the medium, through which the forces of evil and the downward"
16600,SECT. VIII.,inclination would principally act for the purpose of depraving it.
16601,SECT. VIII.,"Even in Homer’s time, the existing mythology contained ample warrant"
16602,SECT. VIII.,for the scene of indulgence here laid bare; and we see the remaining
16603,SECT. VIII.,modesty and delicacy of mankind feebly resisting the torrent of
16604,SECT. VIII.,"passion, which ought to have been counteracted, but which, on the"
16605,SECT. VIII.,"contrary, was principally swollen and impelled, by the agency of the"
16606,SECT. VIII.,acknowledged religion of the country.
16607,SECT. VIII.,
16608,SECT. VIII.,It was impossible for Homer to be altogether above the operation of
16609,SECT. VIII.,influences so closely allied with an origin believed to be celestial:
16610,SECT. VIII.,nor could it be easy for the popular Poet wholly to disregard the
16611,SECT. VIII.,"tastes of his hearers: the Poet, whose strains swept over the whole"
16612,SECT. VIII.,"height and depth of life and nature, both human and divine, could"
16613,SECT. VIII.,not absolutely shut out from his encyclopædic survey so marked a
16614,SECT. VIII.,characteristic of Olympian habits. He has not omitted to mark as
16615,SECT. VIII.,"peculiar, in more ways than one, the licence he has assumed. The lay"
16616,SECT. VIII.,is sung in an assembly attended by men only: and it purports also to
16617,SECT. VIII.,"describe a scene, from which the goddesses intentionally kept away."
16618,SECT. VIII.,"The amusement of the deities present is not universal: Neptune, the"
16619,SECT. VIII.,"senior one among them, does not laugh[888], but takes the matter"
16620,SECT. VIII.,"gravely, and desires to put an end to the scandal, by promising to"
16621,SECT. VIII.,make to the injured husband a pecuniary reparation[889]. He evidently
16622,SECT. VIII.,"appears to act under an impulse of offended dignity at least, though"
16623,SECT. VIII.,"not of modesty. Again, the Poet endeavours to give a ridiculous air,"
16624,SECT. VIII.,"not only a laughable one, to the whole proceeding, through the extreme"
16625,SECT. VIII.,"mortification of the guilty persons; who, when released, are made"
16626,SECT. VIII.,to disappear in real dismay and discomfiture[890]. In this point he
16627,SECT. VIII.,"altogether differs, undoubtedly, from the generality of the writers of"
16628,SECT. VIII.,"licentious pieces, as materially as he does in the simplicity of his"
16629,SECT. VIII.,details; and that supposition of a partially moral aim on which some
16630,SECT. VIII.,"have ventured, is not so extravagant as to deserve total and absolute"
16631,SECT. VIII.,rejection.
16632,SECT. VIII.,
16633,SECT. VIII.,"[888] The translation in Pope’s Odyssey, which in the most material"
16634,SECT. VIII.,"parts has a more highly charged colouring than the Greek original, here"
16635,SECT. VIII.,"reverses the sense. Homer says Neptune did not laugh, οὐδὲ Ποσειδάωνα"
16636,SECT. VIII.,"γέλως ἔχε: Pope says, ‘even Neptune laughs aloud.’ Pope’s work is a"
16637,SECT. VIII.,"great work: but it is not a good rendering, nor a bad rendering, of"
16638,SECT. VIII.,Homer: it is no rendering at all. Od. viii. 244.

16643,SECT. VIII.,
16644,SECT. VIII.,"It has been common to employ, in vindication of Homer, the supposition"
16645,SECT. VIII.,that the passage is spurious. There is something rather more marked
16646,SECT. VIII.,in the personal agency of the Sun than the poems elsewhere present;
16647,SECT. VIII.,"and undoubtedly Apollo is made to assume a tone wholly singular, and"
16648,SECT. VIII.,unsupported by what is told of him in the rest of the poems. These
16649,SECT. VIII.,"are arguments, so far as they go, against it. But I do not venture"
16650,SECT. VIII.,to adopt this alluring expedient: for the general character of the
16651,SECT. VIII.,"colouring, diction, and incidents, appears to be Homeric enough. And"
16652,SECT. VIII.,"again, if licentiousness was to come in, this was exactly the way"
16653,SECT. VIII.,"for its entrance, because it was after a banquet; because it was"
16654,SECT. VIII.,"among men exclusively, and not in the presence of women; because of"
16655,SECT. VIII.,the connection with mythology; and because the tale is thoroughly in
16656,SECT. VIII.,keeping with the mythological character of the personages chiefly
16657,SECT. VIII.,concerned.
16658,SECT. VIII.,
16659,SECT. VIII.,The direct reference however of the evil to the influence of a
16660,SECT. VIII.,perverted religion can be supported by distinct evidence from other
16661,SECT. VIII.,"parts of the poems. In the Iliad there appear to be but two passages,"
16662,SECT. VIII.,which can fairly be termed indelicate. One is the account of the
16663,SECT. VIII.,"proceeding of Juno, with the accompanying speech of Jupiter, in the"
16664,SECT. VIII.,Fourteenth Book[891]. This relation belongs strictly to the mythology
16665,SECT. VIII.,"of the poem, and it is evidently handled in an historical manner; for"
16666,SECT. VIII.,"Jupiter’s details, at least as it seems to me, are introduced for the"
16667,SECT. VIII.,"purpose of fixing ancient national legends, as much as the stories of"
16668,SECT. VIII.,"Nestor and Phœnix. The other passage is that, which in a few words"
16669,SECT. VIII.,"contains the sensual advice given by Thetis, as a mother, to her son"
16670,SECT. VIII.,"Achilles in his grief, by way of comfort;"

16678,SECT. VIII.,
16679,SECT. VIII.,This precisely exemplifies the relation of which I speak. The deity
16680,SECT. VIII.,teaches the debased lesson: the human hero passes by the recommendation
16681,SECT. VIII.,in silence. Homer would have put no such language as this into the
16682,SECT. VIII.,mouth of one of his matrons.
16683,SECT. VIII.,
16684,SECT. VIII.,"When we come to pass sentence upon Homer, we must remember that, since"
16685,SECT. VIII.,in the Odyssey he represents the comic as well as the serious side of
16686,SECT. VIII.,"life, he ought in justice to be first compared with his successors."
16687,SECT. VIII.,And here we not only shall find he gains by the comparison with
16688,SECT. VIII.,"Aristophanes or with Horace, but that he gains yet much more when tried"
16689,SECT. VIII.,by the standard of the other great school of poets which followed him
16690,SECT. VIII.,"in associating heroic subjects with wit and with amusement, namely,"
16691,SECT. VIII.,"the poets of the Italian romance. There is hardly, perhaps, one of"
16692,SECT. VIII.,"that whole school of Christian writers, who has not descended to"
16693,SECT. VIII.,licentiousness of far more malignant type. Nor let it be supposed that
16694,SECT. VIII.,the Æneid shows in this respect any superiority in Virgil or in his
16695,SECT. VIII.,"hearers. As to Virgil, and as to his poems, if we take the whole of"
16696,SECT. VIII.,"them into view, I am afraid that whatever the veil of words may do,"
16697,SECT. VIII.,"the case was in reality bad enough: as to the hearers of the Æneid,"
16698,SECT. VIII.,"we must remember that they were not a people, but a court: we must"
16699,SECT. VIII.,"compare his Roman auditors with the hearers of Homer, not as to that"
16700,SECT. VIII.,"particular only of their public amusements, but as to the whole; that"
16701,SECT. VIII.,"is, we must compare the Homeric poems not with the Æneid alone, but"
16702,SECT. VIII.,"with the Æneid and the Floralia. In Homer’s time, men had not learned"
16703,SECT. VIII.,to screen their vices behind walls which also serve to fortify them.
16704,SECT. VIII.,And it still remains more than doubtful whether the appetite of Homeric
16705,SECT. VIII.,Greece would have endured the garbage on which Christian Florence was
16706,SECT. VIII.,"content to feed, during its carnivals, in the period of its most famous"
16707,SECT. VIII.,civilization.
16708,SECT. VIII.,
16709,SECT. VIII.,~_Evidence of comparative purity._~
16710,SECT. VIII.,
16711,SECT. VIII.,From this scene let us turn to consider the evidence for asserting the
16712,SECT. VIII.,"comparative purity of Homer’s age, and the peculiar purity of his mind."
16713,SECT. VIII.,
16714,SECT. VIII.,2. We find in Homer no trace whatever of the existence of those
16715,SECT. VIII.,"unnatural vices, which appear to have deeply tainted the lives of"
16716,SECT. VIII.,many of the most eminent Greeks of later days[893]; which drew down
16717,SECT. VIII.,the blasting sentence of St. Paul[894]; which in early times had been
16718,SECT. VIII.,"visited on the Cities of the plain; and which, it is no less strange"
16719,SECT. VIII.,"than horrible to think, have left their mark upon more than one period"
16720,SECT. VIII.,"or portion even of the literature of Christendom, in a manner and"
16721,SECT. VIII.,degree such as must excite scarcely less of surprise than shame.

16725,SECT. VIII.,[894] Rom. i. 24-7.
16726,SECT. VIII.,
16727,SECT. VIII.,The seizure of Ganymedes became in later times the basis of a tradition
16728,SECT. VIII.,of this kind: but there is not a trace of it in Homer. The intense love
16729,SECT. VIII.,and admiration of beauty to which his pages bear constant witness is
16730,SECT. VIII.,"wholly disconnected from animal passions, and in its simplicity and"
16731,SECT. VIII.,"earnestness is, for its combined purity and strength, really nearer the"
16732,SECT. VIII.,"feeling of some of the early Italian painters, and of Dante, than any"
16733,SECT. VIII.,thing else I can recall.
16734,SECT. VIII.,
16735,SECT. VIII.,"This is the more remarkable when we bear in mind what had already, and"
16736,SECT. VIII.,"long before his time, happened in the East, and is recorded for us in"
16737,SECT. VIII.,the Book of Genesis.
16738,SECT. VIII.,
16739,SECT. VIII.,Homer most rarely alludes to what is unbecoming in the human form: in
16740,SECT. VIII.,"the case of woman not once, and in the case of men only where he has"
16741,SECT. VIII.,a legitimate and sufficient purpose. Thus when Ulysses[895] threatens
16742,SECT. VIII.,to strip Thersites to the skin in the event of his repeating his
16743,SECT. VIII.,"turbulence and insolence, it is plainly with an honest view to inflict"
16744,SECT. VIII.,"upon him the last extremity of shame, and to make him an object of"
16745,SECT. VIII.,"general and wholly unmixed disgust. Again, when Priam refers to the"
16746,SECT. VIII.,"likelihood that his own body may be stripped naked, and then mangled"
16747,SECT. VIII.,"by animals after his death, every one feels that the insult to natural"
16748,SECT. VIII.,"decency, which he anticipates, contributes only to enhance the agony"
16749,SECT. VIII.,"of his feelings. And the scene in the Odyssey, where Ulysses emerges"
16750,SECT. VIII.,"from the sea upon the coast of Scheria, will always be regarded as one"
16751,SECT. VIII.,"of the most careful, and yet most simple and unaffected, examples of"
16752,SECT. VIII.,true modesty contained in the whole circle of literature. Now these
16753,SECT. VIII.,"appear to be, not peculiarities, but samples of the general manners. We"
16754,SECT. VIII.,should look in vain for the proofs of an equal truth and fineness of
16755,SECT. VIII.,"perception among the Hebrews or among their forefathers, unless it be"
16756,SECT. VIII.,"among a very few individuals, who, under a direct teaching from above,"
16757,SECT. VIII.,became select examples of virtue.
16758,SECT. VIII.,

16761,SECT. VIII.,
16762,SECT. VIII.,Many other indications in the poems converge upon the same point.
16763,SECT. VIII.,The horror with which incest was regarded is one. The deep grief and
16764,SECT. VIII.,humility stamped on the character of Helen is a second. The manner
16765,SECT. VIII.,"in which the chastity of Bellerophon is held up to admiration, and"
16766,SECT. VIII.,"followed by reward, is a third[896]. The high-toned living widowhood of"
16767,SECT. VIII.,Penelope is of itself conclusive on the point before us.

16769,SECT. VIII.,"[896] Il. vi. 161, 2."
16770,SECT. VIII.,
16771,SECT. VIII.,"Homer’s subject in the Iliad was one, which tempted and almost forced"
16772,SECT. VIII.,"him into indecency, where he had to refer to the original crime of"
16773,SECT. VIII.,Paris or to describe his private life. The manner in which he has
16774,SECT. VIII.,handled it is deserving of all praise. He treats as an evil gift the
16775,SECT. VIII.,original promise and temptation to Paris. The scene in the end of the
16776,SECT. VIII.,Third Book was necessary in order to complete the view of the character
16777,SECT. VIII.,of that bad prince: and it could not have been drawn in a manner
16778,SECT. VIII.,"less calculated to seduce the mind, whether by the management of its"
16779,SECT. VIII.,"details, or by the sentiments of loathing which it raises against the"
16780,SECT. VIII.,principal actor.
16781,SECT. VIII.,
16782,SECT. VIII.,"Undoubtedly we must, as regards the whole morality of the poems,"
16783,SECT. VIII.,ascribe much to the praise of Homer personally: yet it is plain that he
16784,SECT. VIII.,"represented his age in no small degree. First, because, as a popular"
16785,SECT. VIII.,"and famous minstrel, he could not have been in sharp or general"
16786,SECT. VIII.,"contrast with the feeling of his contemporaries. Secondly, because we"
16787,SECT. VIII.,perceive remains of this seriousness and purity in the older Greek
16788,SECT. VIII.,"writers junior to Homer. Thirdly, because we find from Thucydides"
16789,SECT. VIII.,"that, at the time when the original Olympian games were instituted,"
16790,SECT. VIII.,it was still the custom carefully to avoid the exposure of the human
16791,SECT. VIII.,"form, and that a different practice was introduced afterwards by the"
16792,SECT. VIII.,"Lacedæmonians, probably without evil intention, and for gymnastic ends"
16793,SECT. VIII.,alone (Thuc. i. 6).
16794,SECT. VIII.,
16795,SECT. VIII.,"And now, if we contemplate the belief, ideas, and institutions of"
16796,SECT. VIII.,"the heroic period, as they would work upon an individual, we shall,"
16797,SECT. VIII.,"perhaps, find that they fully justify the outline with which this"
16798,SECT. VIII.,"section began. We may, indeed, see in the Homeric pictures of that age"
16799,SECT. VIII.,much to condemn or to deplore; but we may also be led to believe that
16800,SECT. VIII.,"if, through God’s mercy, there have been happier, there also have been"
16801,SECT. VIII.,"less happy forms, for human destiny to be cast in."
16802,SECT. VIII.,

16804,SECT. VIII.,
16805,SECT. VIII.,"The youth of high birth, not then so widely as now separated from"
16806,SECT. VIII.,"the low, is educated under tutors in reverence for his parents, and"
16807,SECT. VIII.,in desire to emulate their fame: he shares in manly and in graceful
16808,SECT. VIII.,"sports, acquires the use of arms, hardens himself in the pursuit,"
16809,SECT. VIII.,"then, of all others the most indispensable, the hunting down of wild"
16810,SECT. VIII.,"beasts, gains the knowledge of medicine, probably also of the lyre."
16811,SECT. VIII.,"Sometimes, with many-sided intelligence, he even sets himself to"
16812,SECT. VIII.,"learn how to build his own house or ship, or how to drive the plough"
16813,SECT. VIII.,"firm and straight down the furrow, as well as to reap the standing"
16814,SECT. VIII.,"corn[897]. And when scarcely a man, he bears arms for his country or"
16815,SECT. VIII.,"his tribe, takes part in its government, learns by direct instruction"
16816,SECT. VIII.,and by practice how to rule mankind through the use of reasoning and
16817,SECT. VIII.,"persuasive power in political assemblies, attends and assists in"
16818,SECT. VIII.,sacrifices to the gods. For all this time he has been in kindly and
16819,SECT. VIII.,"free relations, not only with his parents, his family, his equals of"
16820,SECT. VIII.,"his own age, but with the attendants, although they are but serfs, who"
16821,SECT. VIII.,have known him from infancy on his father’s domain.
16822,SECT. VIII.,
16823,SECT. VIII.,[897] Od. xviii. 366-75.
16824,SECT. VIII.,
16825,SECT. VIII.,He is indeed mistaught with reference to the use of the strong hand.
16826,SECT. VIII.,Human life is cheap; so cheap that even a mild and gentle youth may
16827,SECT. VIII.,"be betrayed, upon a casual quarrel over some childish game with his"
16828,SECT. VIII.,"friend, into taking it away. And even so throughout his life, should"
16829,SECT. VIII.,"some occasion come that stirs up his passions from their depths, a wild"
16830,SECT. VIII.,"beast, as it were, awakes within him, and he loses his humanity for"
16831,SECT. VIII.,"the time until reason has re-established her control. Short, however,"
16832,SECT. VIII.,"of such a desperate crisis, though he could not for the world rob his"
16833,SECT. VIII.,"friend or his neighbour, yet he might be not unwilling to triumph over"
16834,SECT. VIII.,"him to his cost, for the sake of some exercise of signal ingenuity:"
16835,SECT. VIII.,"while, from a hostile tribe or a foreign shore, or from the individual"
16836,SECT. VIII.,"who has become his enemy, he will acquire by main force what he"
16837,SECT. VIII.,"can, nor will he scruple to inflict on him by stratagem even deadly"
16838,SECT. VIII.,"injury[898]. He must, however, give liberally to those who are in need;"
16839,SECT. VIII.,"to the wayfarer, the poor, the suppliant who begs from him shelter and"
16840,SECT. VIII.,"protection. On the other hand, should his own goods be wasted, the"
16841,SECT. VIII.,liberal and open-handed contributions of his neighbours will not be
16842,SECT. VIII.,wanting to replace them.
16843,SECT. VIII.,
16844,SECT. VIII.,[898] Od. xiii. 259-70.
16845,SECT. VIII.,
16846,SECT. VIII.,His early youth is not solicited into vice by finding sensual excess in
16847,SECT. VIII.,"vogue, or the opportunities of it staring in his eye and sounding in"
16848,SECT. VIII.,his ear. Gluttony is hardly known; drunkenness is marked only by its
16849,SECT. VIII.,degrading character and the evil consequences that flow so straight
16850,SECT. VIII.,"from it, and is abhorred. But he loves the genial use of meals, and"
16851,SECT. VIII.,"rejoices in the hour when the guests, gathered in his father’s hall,"
16852,SECT. VIII.,"enjoy a liberal hospitality, and the wine mantles in the cup[899]."
16853,SECT. VIII.,"For then they listen to the strains of the minstrel, who celebrates"
16854,SECT. VIII.,before them the newest and the dearest of the heroic tales that stir
16855,SECT. VIII.,"their blood, and rouse their manly resolution to be worthy, in their"
16856,SECT. VIII.,"turn, of their country and their country’s heroes. He joins the dance"
16857,SECT. VIII.,"in the festivals of religion; the maiden’s hand upon his wrist, and"
16858,SECT. VIII.,"the gilded knife glancing from his belt, as they course from point to"
16859,SECT. VIII.,"point, or wheel in round on round[900]. That maiden, some Nausicaa or"
16860,SECT. VIII.,"some Hermione of a neighbouring district, in due time he weds, amidst"
16861,SECT. VIII.,"the rejoicings of their families, and brings her home to cherish her,"
16862,SECT. VIII.,"‘from the flower to the ripeness of the grape,’ with respect, fidelity,"

16875,SECT. VIII.,which already there is large resort. In peace he settles the disputes

16887,SECT. VIII.,"Such was, probably, the state of society amidst the concluding phase of"

16889,SECT. VIII.,revolution seems to have followed the Trojan war: we have its workings
16890,SECT. VIII.,already become visible in the Odyssey. Scarcely could even Ulysses cope
16891,SECT. VIII.,"with it, contracted though it was for him within the narrow bounds of"
16892,SECT. VIII.,"Ithaca. On the mainland, the bands of the elder society are soon wholly"
16893,SECT. VIII.,"broken. The Pelopid, Neleid, Œneid houses are a wreck: disorganization"
16894,SECT. VIII.,invites the entry of new forces to control it: the Dorian lances

16899,SECT. VIII.,
16900,SECT. VIII.,When we take a general survey of the practical morality of the Heroic
16901,SECT. VIII.,"age, and compare it with that of later times, we must at once be struck"
16902,SECT. VIII.,"with the great superiority of the former, in all that most nearly"
16903,SECT. VIII.,"touches the moral being of man. The mere police of society, indeed,"
16904,SECT. VIII.,improves with the advance of civilization. The law of determinate
16905,SECT. VIII.,"rights to property, which we rather dangerously call the law of _meum_"
16906,SECT. VIII.,"and _tuum_, whereas it is but a limited part of that great ordinance,"
16907,SECT. VIII.,"comes to be better understood in later times, and better defended by"
16908,SECT. VIII.,"penal sanctions. A clearer ideal, as well as actual, distinction, is"
16909,SECT. VIII.,gradually established between force and civil right. But who will
16910,SECT. VIII.,"venture to say that the duties of man to the Deity, or the larger"
16911,SECT. VIII.,"claims of man upon man, were better understood in the age of Pericles"
16912,SECT. VIII.,"or Alexander, of Sylla or of Augustus, than in the days of Homer?"
16913,SECT. VIII.,
16914,SECT. VIII.,"It is to be expected that, when the elements of wealth are for the"
16915,SECT. VIII.,"most part such as nature offers, when man has hardly left the mark"
16916,SECT. VIII.,"of his hand upon the earth, when little has been appropriated, and"
16917,SECT. VIII.,"that little indeterminately, then the description of right which is"
16918,SECT. VIII.,"least understood should also be least respected; namely, the law which"
16919,SECT. VIII.,withdraws things from original community of use into individual
16920,SECT. VIII.,"dominion. To this day we dispute, what was the pristine foundation of"
16921,SECT. VIII.,the law of property. Why do we not perceive that this is equivalent
16922,SECT. VIII.,"to an admission, that in the first periods of political society, the"
16923,SECT. VIII.,whole idea of property must of necessity have been more or less vague?
16924,SECT. VIII.,"And consequently, that even plunder in primitive times is a different"
16925,SECT. VIII.,"thing from plunder in later times, not only as to public estimation,"
16926,SECT. VIII.,"but as to the moral colour of the act, and that it should be judged"
16927,SECT. VIII.,accordingly?
16928,SECT. VIII.,
16929,SECT. VIII.,~_Points of superiority in the former._~
16930,SECT. VIII.,
16931,SECT. VIII.,Let us then consider the notes of moral superiority which the Heroic
16932,SECT. VIII.,age of Greece presents to us.
16933,SECT. VIII.,
16934,SECT. VIII.,Human sacrifices were not then offered upon bloody altars to the gods.
16935,SECT. VIII.,Not even the direst extremity of suffering suggested the thought of
16936,SECT. VIII.,cannibalism as an alternative of escape from death[903]. Wailing
16937,SECT. VIII.,infants were not then exposed to avoid the burden of their nurture.
16938,SECT. VIII.,The grey hairs of parents were treated with reverence and care; and if
16939,SECT. VIII.,"their weakness brought down insult upon them, it stung the souls of"
16940,SECT. VIII.,"their children, even after death. To age in general a deep and hearty"
16941,SECT. VIII.,"reverence was paid by the young. Woman, the grand refining element of"
16942,SECT. VIII.,"society, had not then been put down in the estimation of any man, far"
16943,SECT. VIII.,"less of the wisest men, to the level of persons degraded by the habits"
16944,SECT. VIII.,"of captivity, and was not held to be a ζῶον ἔμψυχον. Slavery itself was"
16945,SECT. VIII.,"mild and almost genial. It implied the law of labour, and possibly,"
16946,SECT. VIII.,"in ordinary cases, a prohibition to rise in life: but of positive"
16947,SECT. VIII.,"oppression, and of suffering in connection with it, or of any penal"
16948,SECT. VIII.,"system directed to its maintenance, we have no trace whatever. Marriage"
16949,SECT. VIII.,was the honourable and single tie between man and his helpmate[904].
16950,SECT. VIII.,Connections with very near relations were regarded with horror; the
16951,SECT. VIII.,"wife was the representative, the intelligent companion and friend, of"
16952,SECT. VIII.,"her husband; adultery was held in aversion, a crime rarer then than in"
16953,SECT. VIII.,most after-periods: and the sacred bond between husband and wife was
16954,SECT. VIII.,not liable to be broken by the poor invention of divorce.

16957,SECT. VIII.,
16958,SECT. VIII.,"[904] On this and the kindred points, see inf. sect. ix."
16959,SECT. VIII.,
16960,SECT. VIII.,Organized unchastity had not then become a kind of devil’s law for
16961,SECT. VIII.,society. The very name and nature of unnatural lusts appear to have
16962,SECT. VIII.,"been unknown in Greece, centuries after Sodom had been smitten for"
16963,SECT. VIII.,"its crimes. The detestable invention, which set gladiators to kill"
16964,SECT. VIII.,"one another for the amusement of enraptured spectators, was reserved"
16965,SECT. VIII.,for times more vain of their philosophy and their artificial culture.
16966,SECT. VIII.,The rights of the poor were acknowledged in the form of an unlimited
16967,SECT. VIII.,"obligation to relieve them, under pain of the divine displeasure: and"
16968,SECT. VIII.,"no stranger or suppliant could be repelled from the door of any one,"
16969,SECT. VIII.,who regarded either the fear of God or the fear of man.
16970,SECT. VIII.,
16971,SECT. VIII.,"As respects the gods, the remains of ancient piety still in some degree"
16972,SECT. VIII.,"checked the activity of the critical faculty, and the reverence for the"
16973,SECT. VIII.,Power that disposes events and hates the wicked was not yet derided
16974,SECT. VIII.,"by speculation, nor wholly buried beneath fable and corruption. True,"
16975,SECT. VIII.,sacrifice was regarded as the indispensable and effective basis of
16976,SECT. VIII.,"religion: but in general, as between Greek and Greek, those who were"
16977,SECT. VIII.,most careful of virtue were also most regular in their offerings. Men
16978,SECT. VIII.,"were believers in prayer: they thought that, if in need they humbly"
16979,SECT. VIII.,"betook themselves to supplication, they would be heard and helped."
16980,SECT. VIII.,"In short, they kept their hold upon a higher power, which we see"
16981,SECT. VIII.,"to have been real, because they resorted to it at those times when"
16982,SECT. VIII.,"human nature eschews illusion, and cries out for reality. Ulysses, in"
16983,SECT. VIII.,"affliction or in need, addresses himself to the gods: even Ægisthus,"
16984,SECT. VIII.,"when alarmed, begins to think much of them: but Cicero or Quintilian,"
16985,SECT. VIII.,"when the arrow of grief has touched them to the quick, seek for comfort"
16986,SECT. VIII.,in philosophical calculations on the great woe and little weal of life.
16987,SECT. VIII.,
16988,SECT. VIII.,"Yet, even while all this was so, there lay in the accumulating"
16989,SECT. VIII.,"mythology the thickly scattered seeds of destruction, both for belief"
16990,SECT. VIII.,"and for duty. How could marriage continue single, pure, or permanent,"
16991,SECT. VIII.,in the face of the promiscuous lusts of Jupiter? Why should not
16992,SECT. VIII.,"helpless infants be exposed, when Juno, disgusted with the form of"
16993,SECT. VIII.,"Vulcan, threw him down into the sea? Why should not man make a joyous"
16994,SECT. VIII.,"spectacle of blood and wounds, when they were already beheld with"
16995,SECT. VIII.,"amusement by the highest of the gods? The examples of rebellion, of"
16996,SECT. VIII.,"discord, of luxury and selfish ease, were all of them ready to forward"
16997,SECT. VIII.,the process of corruption among men; and this armoury of curses was
16998,SECT. VIII.,"prepared too in the very quarter, where his eye should behold nothing"
16999,SECT. VIII.,but what is august and pure.
17000,SECT. VIII.,
17001,SECT. VIII.,Again. In all descriptions of tender feelings the Greeks of the Homeric
17002,SECT. VIII.,age are much nearer than those of later times to the standard of truth
17003,SECT. VIII.,and nature.

17005,SECT. VIII.,"The heroes of Homer weep freely; but, says the Agamemnon of"

17022,SECT. VIII.,
17023,SECT. VIII.,"There are indeed three most important points of the Homeric poems, in"
17024,SECT. VIII.,"which it would appear that the Greek character greatly hardened, and"
17025,SECT. VIII.,"greatly sank, as the nation advanced in its career. One of them is the"
17026,SECT. VIII.,"principle of sympathy. Another is that of placability, which Homer has"
17027,SECT. VIII.,"very powerfully exhibited in Achilles. The third is that of humility,"
17028,SECT. VIII.,"of which we have an example in Helen, in the Helen of Troy and the"
17029,SECT. VIII.,"Helen of Sparta, such as heathenism nowhere else, I believe, presents"
17030,SECT. VIII.,to us.
17031,SECT. VIII.,
17032,SECT. VIII.,It has thus appeared that if we take the state of morality as it
17033,SECT. VIII.,"appears among mankind in the poems of Homer, and compare it with that"
17034,SECT. VIII.,"of Greece in its highest civilization, we find before us two grand"
17035,SECT. VIII.,"differences. Those offences against the moral law, which constitute"
17036,SECT. VIII.,"crimes of violence, were more justly appreciated at the later period;"
17037,SECT. VIII.,"but as to those which constitute, in the language of Christianity, the"
17038,SECT. VIII.,"lusts of the mind and of the flesh, a great preference is due to the"
17039,SECT. VIII.,former.
17040,SECT. VIII.,
17041,SECT. VIII.,"We are naturally led to inquire, Whence these two movements in opposite"
17042,SECT. VIII.,"directions? That mankind should either lose ground or gain it, in"
17043,SECT. VIII.,"morality as a whole, is far less startling at first sight, than that,"
17044,SECT. VIII.,"at one and the same time, with respect to one great portion of the"
17045,SECT. VIII.,"moral law there should be progress, and with respect to another,"
17046,SECT. VIII.,retrogression.
17047,SECT. VIII.,
17048,SECT. VIII.,"In reality, however, this was the condition of man: retrogression as to"
17049,SECT. VIII.,"his spiritual life, but advance and development, up to a certain point,"
17050,SECT. VIII.,with regard to the intellectual and the social career. Sins of the
17051,SECT. VIII.,flesh lay chiefly between God and the individual conscience: the social
17052,SECT. VIII.,results did not palpably and immediately reach beyond the persons
17053,SECT. VIII.,immediately concerned. But crimes of violence struck directly at the
17054,SECT. VIII.,fabric of society by destroying security of person and property; and
17055,SECT. VIII.,"robbed mankind, especially the ruling part of mankind, of the immense"
17056,SECT. VIII.,"advantages and enjoyments which they reaped from civilized life. Thus,"
17057,SECT. VIII.,"the moral sense was quick, and even grew quicker with the lapse of"
17058,SECT. VIII.,"time, when it was fed and prompted by such motives of self-interest"
17059,SECT. VIII.,"as lay within its appreciation, like those which the desire to enjoy"
17060,SECT. VIII.,"the commodities of life supplied. But it languished and all but died,"
17061,SECT. VIII.,when its business was to maintain those virtues which involve severe
17062,SECT. VIII.,"self-denial, and of which the reward never can be fully appreciated"
17063,SECT. VIII.,except by those who are so favoured as to practise them in the highest
17064,SECT. VIII.,degree.
17065,SECT. VIII.,
17066,SECT. VIII.,Nor must we overlook some special bearings of the institution of
17067,SECT. VIII.,"slavery upon this question. As it grew and was consolidated, it of"
17068,SECT. VIII.,course entailed an increased necessity for laws to defend life and
17069,SECT. VIII.,"goods against violence. But as regarded the other class of offences,"
17070,SECT. VIII.,its influence was all in the sense of more and more relaxation. For
17071,SECT. VIII.,"beauty and defencelessness, when they were combined in slaves, at once"
17072,SECT. VIII.,"wrought up attraction to the uttermost, and removed all obstacles to"
17073,SECT. VIII.,"enjoyment. While at the same time the partial indulgence, which at all"
17074,SECT. VIII.,periods has commonly attended such commerce between slaves and their
17075,SECT. VIII.,"masters, operated as a safety valve to let off the political dangers"
17076,SECT. VIII.,"of that system: so that, on the one hand, slavery was a feeder to lust,"
17077,SECT. VIII.,"and, on the other, lust was a buttress to slavery."
17078,SECT. VIII.,
17079,SECT. VIII.,That it was not on moral grounds that in the later times of Greece life
17080,SECT. VIII.,"and property were better defended than in the former, we may partly"
17081,SECT. VIII.,"judge from finding that, though it is in the nature of all society that"
17082,SECT. VIII.,a nation should rather incline to gild the days of its forefathers
17083,SECT. VIII.,"with ornaments beyond the truth, the later Greek traditions crammed"
17084,SECT. VIII.,the heroic age with a mass of crimes of which Homer knows nothing.
17085,SECT. VIII.,He sets Minos and Rhadamanthus before us as characters positively
17086,SECT. VIII.,good: Thyestes and others are at worst neutral in character: but all
17087,SECT. VIII.,"these, according to the later tradition, were either accessory to, or"
17088,SECT. VIII.,"contaminated with, the most horrible enormities."
17089,SECT. VIII.,
17090,SECT. VIII.,~_Notes in the Poems of commencing decline._~
17091,SECT. VIII.,
17092,SECT. VIII.,"It seems, indeed, as if Homer had himself lived to note the signs"
17093,SECT. VIII.,"of moral degeneracy. In part, we may perhaps say, it is inseparably"
17094,SECT. VIII.,associated with that deterioration in the character and idea of
17095,SECT. VIII.,"government, which begins to be traceable in the Odyssey. But in that"
17096,SECT. VIII.,"poem he has given us another indication of it, unlike any thing in the"
17097,SECT. VIII.,"Iliad, where he never contrasts the present unfavourably with the past,"
17098,SECT. VIII.,except as to mere corporal strength. For he makes Minerva as Mentor
17099,SECT. VIII.,"deliver to Telemachus the sentiment, that among sons a small number"
17100,SECT. VIII.,"only are equal to their fathers[907], a very few indeed excelling them,"
17101,SECT. VIII.,"but the greater part falling short of them. In later times, we have"
17102,SECT. VIII.,come to associate threnodies of this kind with the notion that they
17103,SECT. VIII.,"are complaints of course, formulæ taken up and reiterated successively"
17104,SECT. VIII.,from generation to generation. It may or may not be just thus to view
17105,SECT. VIII.,"them: but whether it be just or not for later times, I think that we"
17106,SECT. VIII.,ought not so to limit the force of the idea when it meets us in the
17107,SECT. VIII.,"age of Homer: the world was then young, and human society had not so"
17108,SECT. VIII.,"learned its ‘ancient saws or modern instances,’ as to separate them"
17109,SECT. VIII.,from the truths of experience and of observation. The greatest ornament
17110,SECT. VIII.,"of the poems of Hesiod, the series of the Ages declining from gold to"
17111,SECT. VIII.,"iron, probably expresses the actual state of the facts, as it seems to"
17112,SECT. VIII.,move on the same line with the narrative of the early Scriptures: and
17113,SECT. VIII.,Homer’s lamentation on degeneracy in all likelihood may belong to a
17114,SECT. VIII.,real portion of the same descending process.

17124,SECT. IX.,
17125,SECT. IX.,
17126,SECT. IX.,No view of a peculiar civilization can on its ethical side be
17127,SECT. IX.,"satisfactory, unless it include a distinct consideration of the place"
17128,SECT. IX.,"held in it by woman. And, besides, the position of the Greek woman of"
17129,SECT. IX.,"the heroic age is in itself so remarkable, as even on special grounds"
17130,SECT. IX.,"to require separate and detailed notice. It is likewise so elevated,"
17131,SECT. IX.,both absolutely and in comparison with what it became in the historic
17132,SECT. IX.,"ages of Greece and Rome amidst their elaborate civilization, as to form"
17133,SECT. IX.,in itself a sufficient confutation of the theories of those writers
17134,SECT. IX.,who can see in the history of mankind only the development of a law
17135,SECT. IX.,"of continual progress from intellectual darkness into light, and from"
17136,SECT. IX.,moral degradation up to virtue.
17137,SECT. IX.,
17138,SECT. IX.,The idea and place of woman have been slowly and laboriously elevated
17139,SECT. IX.,by the Gospel: and their full development has constituted the purest
17140,SECT. IX.,"and most perfect protest, that the world has ever seen, against the"
17141,SECT. IX.,"sovereignty of force. For it is not alone against merely physical, but"
17142,SECT. IX.,"also against merely intellectual strength, that this protest has been"
17143,SECT. IX.,lodged. To the very highest range of intellectual strength known among
17144,SECT. IX.,"the children of Adam, woman seems never to have ascended, but in every"
17145,SECT. IX.,or almost every case to have fallen somewhat short of it. But when we
17146,SECT. IX.,"look to the virtues, it seems probable both that her average is higher,"
17147,SECT. IX.,and that she also attains in the highest instances to loftier summits.
17148,SECT. IX.,Certainly there is no proof here of her inferiority to man. Now it is
17149,SECT. IX.,"nowhere written in Holy Scripture that God is knowledge, or that God is"
17150,SECT. IX.,power; while it is written that God is love: words which appear to set
17151,SECT. IX.,"forth love as the central essence, and all besides as attributes. Woman"
17152,SECT. IX.,"then holds of God, and finds her own principal development in that"
17153,SECT. IX.,"which is most God-like. Thus, therefore, when Christianity wrought out"
17154,SECT. IX.,"for woman, not a social identity, but a social equality, not a rivalry"
17155,SECT. IX.,"with the function of man, but an elevation in her own function reaching"
17156,SECT. IX.,"as high as his, it made the world and human life in this respect also"
17157,SECT. IX.,a true image of the Godhead.
17158,SECT. IX.,
17159,SECT. IX.,Within the pale of that civilization which has grown up under the
17160,SECT. IX.,"combined influence of the Christian religion as paramount, and of what"
17161,SECT. IX.,"may be called the Teutonic manners as secondary, we find the idea of"
17162,SECT. IX.,woman and her social position raised to a point even higher than in the
17163,SECT. IX.,poems of Homer. But it would be hard to discover any period of history
17164,SECT. IX.,"or country of the world, not being Christian, in which they stood so"
17165,SECT. IX.,high as with the Greeks of the heroic age.
17166,SECT. IX.,
17167,SECT. IX.,There are various heads under which we may inquire into the subject
17168,SECT. IX.,before us.
17169,SECT. IX.,
17170,SECT. IX.,"One is the law of marriage in the heroic age, and the state of the"
17171,SECT. IX.,specific relation between the sexes.
17172,SECT. IX.,
17173,SECT. IX.,"A second is the employments assigned to women; how high did they reach,"
17174,SECT. IX.,and how low did they descend?
17175,SECT. IX.,
17176,SECT. IX.,"A third is the social footing on which they stood, as tested by"
17177,SECT. IX.,manners.
17178,SECT. IX.,
17179,SECT. IX.,"A fourth is the general outline of the woman’s character, as it is to"
17180,SECT. IX.,be estimated from the varied specimens which Homer has set before us.
17181,SECT. IX.,
17182,SECT. IX.,~_Law and custom of marriage._~
17183,SECT. IX.,
17184,SECT. IX.,Firstly; a main criterion of the general condition of woman in a given
17185,SECT. IX.,state of society is to be found in the view which it may exhibit of
17186,SECT. IX.,the great institution of marriage. In proportion as that institution
17187,SECT. IX.,"is purified and elevated by just restraint, the condition of woman"
17188,SECT. IX.,"is honourable, free, and happy. In proportion as it is relaxed, in"
17189,SECT. IX.,"accommodation to human infirmity or appetite, the condition of woman"
17190,SECT. IX.,"is degraded and servile; for where desire is the law, strength is its"
17191,SECT. IX.,"appropriate and only sanction, and the cause of the weaker fails. Just"
17192,SECT. IX.,"as a strict and efficient police is most important to the unprotected,"
17193,SECT. IX.,so a strict law of marriage is most for the interest of the woman.
17194,SECT. IX.,
17195,SECT. IX.,The general position of womankind in the Homeric age is high on both
17196,SECT. IX.,"sides of the Archipelago; but, as respects marriage, its chiefest"
17197,SECT. IX.,"pillar, it is perceptibly even higher among the Greeks than among"
17198,SECT. IX.,"the Trojans. Among the multitude of cases, that either directly or"
17199,SECT. IX.,"incidentally come before us in the poems, there is nothing that at"
17200,SECT. IX.,"all resembles the Asiatic household of Priam, or that seems to favour"
17201,SECT. IX.,polygamy. Nor have we any instance where a wife is divorced or taken
17202,SECT. IX.,"away from her husband, and then made the wife of another man during"
17203,SECT. IX.,"his lifetime. The froward Suitors, who urge Penelope to choose a new"
17204,SECT. IX.,"husband from among them, do it upon the plea that Ulysses must be"
17205,SECT. IX.,"dead, and that there is no hope of his return: a plea not irrational,"
17206,SECT. IX.,if we presume that the real term of his absence came to even half the
17207,SECT. IX.,number of years which Homer has assigned to it. The ancient law of
17208,SECT. IX.,"England, while it repudiated the principle of divorce, recognised the"
17209,SECT. IX.,"presumption of the husband’s death, when brought near to certainty by"
17210,SECT. IX.,"a long term of absence, as equivalent to death itself for the purpose"
17211,SECT. IX.,of exempting the wife from civil penalty in case of her marriage.
17212,SECT. IX.,"Ægisthus, again, finds it extremely difficult to corrupt Clytemnestra:"
17213,SECT. IX.,"and his success in inducing her to marry him entails, as if a matter"
17214,SECT. IX.,"of course, the murder of her former husband. The crime is mentioned"
17215,SECT. IX.,"by Jupiter, in the Olympian Court, as consisting of the two parts, of"
17216,SECT. IX.,which he by no means specifies the latter as the more atrocious[908];
17217,SECT. IX.,
17218,SECT. IX.,[908] Od. i. 36.
17219,SECT. IX.,
17220,SECT. IX.,"(1) γῆμ’ ἄλοχον μνηστὴν, (2) τὸν δ’ ἔκτανε νοστήσαντα."
17221,SECT. IX.,
17222,SECT. IX.,The law of marriage differs from most other human laws in a very
17223,SECT. IX.,important particular. It is their excellence to impose the _minimum_
17224,SECT. IX.,"of restraint, which will satisfy the absolute wants of society: but"
17225,SECT. IX.,the aim and the criterion of a good law of marriage is to impose the
17226,SECT. IX.,_maximum_ of restraint that human nature can be induced _bonâ fide_ to
17227,SECT. IX.,accept. Doubtless there is here also a conceivable excess: but it would
17228,SECT. IX.,"be and has been indicated by the general withholding of submission,"
17229,SECT. IX.,"or evasion of obedience. Up to that point, the restrictions of the"
17230,SECT. IX.,marriage law are not evils to be endured for the sake of a greater
17231,SECT. IX.,"good, but are good in themselves."
17232,SECT. IX.,
17233,SECT. IX.,"In order that this great institution may thoroughly fulfil its ends, it"
17234,SECT. IX.,"is especially requisite,"
17235,SECT. IX.,
17236,SECT. IX.,1. That it should not be contracted between more than one man and one
17237,SECT. IX.,woman.
17238,SECT. IX.,
17239,SECT. IX.,"2. That it should on both sides be, in the main and as a general rule,"
17240,SECT. IX.,deliberate and spontaneous.
17241,SECT. IX.,
17242,SECT. IX.,"3. That the contract, once made, should not be dissolved."
17243,SECT. IX.,
17244,SECT. IX.,And closely allied to these there is yet a fourth negative:
17245,SECT. IX.,
17246,SECT. IX.,4. That nuptials should not be contracted between persons who stand
17247,SECT. IX.,within certain near degrees of relationship.
17248,SECT. IX.,
17249,SECT. IX.,5. It is always requisite that this engagement should exclude not only
17250,SECT. IX.,"the possibility of marriage for either partner with a third person, but"
17251,SECT. IX.,also any other fleshly connection without marriage.
17252,SECT. IX.,
17253,SECT. IX.,"Of these propositions, the first, third, and fourth, are heads of"
17254,SECT. IX.,restraint on marriage. Every one of the three was acknowledged by the
17255,SECT. IX.,Greeks of the heroic age.
17256,SECT. IX.,
17257,SECT. IX.,~_Marriage always single._~
17258,SECT. IX.,
17259,SECT. IX.,"The rule of conjugal fidelity was admitted, though not wholly without"
17260,SECT. IX.,"relaxation, to be as applicable to men as to their wives. This, and"
17261,SECT. IX.,"all the other restrictions, were applied to women with undeviating"
17262,SECT. IX.,strictness.
17263,SECT. IX.,
17264,SECT. IX.,"1. As regards the first, it is plain, from a mass of evidence so large"
17265,SECT. IX.,"as to amount, in spite of its being negative, to demonstration, that"
17266,SECT. IX.,the uniform practice of the Greeks required the marriage union to be
17267,SECT. IX.,"single. This, however, of itself, is saying little; but it imports much"
17268,SECT. IX.,"besides what is on the surface: it implies, that, with due allowances,"
17269,SECT. IX.,the spirit of the marriage contract is a spirit of equity and of well
17270,SECT. IX.,"adjusted rights, as between those who enter into it."
17271,SECT. IX.,
17272,SECT. IX.,2. This relation was also conceived by the Greeks in a spirit of
17273,SECT. IX.,freedom.
17274,SECT. IX.,
17275,SECT. IX.,"It held a central place in life thoroughly European, as opposed to"
17276,SECT. IX.,"the Oriental ideas. Nay, it approximated very much to the ideas"
17277,SECT. IX.,prevailing in our own country as well as age. We do not find in the
17278,SECT. IX.,poems any instance of a marriage enforced against the will of a young
17279,SECT. IX.,"maiden, or contracted when she was of years too tender to exercise a"
17280,SECT. IX.,"judgment. Nausicaa fears that if she is seen with Ulysses, censorious"
17281,SECT. IX.,tongues will immediately put it about that she is going to be married
17282,SECT. IX.,"to him. They will say, ‘Who is this tall and handsome stranger with"
17283,SECT. IX.,Nausicaa?’[909] Surely she is going to become his bride. Truly she
17284,SECT. IX.,"has picked up some gallant from afar, who has strayed from his ship:"
17285,SECT. IX.,or some god has come down to wed her. Better it were if she found a
17286,SECT. IX.,"husband from abroad, since, forsooth, she looks down upon her Phæacian"
17287,SECT. IX.,"suitors, though they are many and noble. Then continues this model of"
17288,SECT. IX.,maidens; ‘Thus I shall come into disgrace; and indeed I myself should
17289,SECT. IX.,"be indignant with any one who should so act, and who, against the will"
17290,SECT. IX.,"of her parents, frequented the company of men before being publicly"
17291,SECT. IX.,married.’ In this remarkable passage we have such an exhibition of
17292,SECT. IX.,"woman’s freedom, as scarcely any age has exceeded. For it clearly shows"
17293,SECT. IX.,"that the marriage of a damsel was her own affair, and that, subject to"
17294,SECT. IX.,"a due regard freely rendered to authority and opinion, she had, when of"
17295,SECT. IX.,"due age, a main share in determining it. That is to say, to the extent"
17296,SECT. IX.,of choosing a mate among the competitors. The expression of giving
17297,SECT. IX.,"away or promising a daughter, by parents, is often used[910], but we"
17298,SECT. IX.,perceive the limits of its meaning from the passage just quoted. The
17299,SECT. IX.,"more so, because similar expressions as to the proceedings of parents"
17300,SECT. IX.,are applied in Homer to the marriages of sons[911]. I do not suppose it
17301,SECT. IX.,would have been open to any maiden to remain single. That all should
17302,SECT. IX.,"marry, that there should be no class living in celibacy, was a kind"
17303,SECT. IX.,"of law for society in its infant state, even as now it may be said to"
17304,SECT. IX.,be almost a law for the most numerous classes of society. Above all I
17305,SECT. IX.,suppose it to be clear that a marriageable widow could not ordinarily
17306,SECT. IX.,"remain in widowhood. No reproach arises to Helen, on account of the"
17307,SECT. IX.,"renewal of her irregular union with Deiphobus; and when Penelope,"
17308,SECT. IX.,"or others in her behalf, contemplate the death of Ulysses, and her"
17309,SECT. IX.,"consequent release from the marriage state, that change is always"
17310,SECT. IX.,"treated as the immediate preface to another crisis, namely, the choice"

17337,SECT. IX.,"to ingratiate themselves with the women of the household of Ulysses,"
17338,SECT. IX.,"speak favourably of the free condition of the sex, and seem to show,"
17339,SECT. IX.,that it descended even into lower stations.

17341,SECT. IX.,"For the Greek in the heroic age, marriage was the pivot of life. It"
17342,SECT. IX.,"took place in the bloom of age: hence[913] the beautiful expression,"
17343,SECT. IX.,"θαλερὸς γάμος, Od. vi. 66, xx. 74. It even marks of itself the age of"
17344,SECT. IX.,"persons; Alcinous has five sons, three ἠΐθεοι, and two ὀπυίοντες, (Od."

17349,SECT. IX.,"Presents were usually brought by the bridegroom, and dowries sometimes"
17350,SECT. IX.,"given with the bride. Where the two concurred, the presents may have"
17351,SECT. IX.,"been either in the nature of compliments, or intended to meet the"
17352,SECT. IX.,"expense of the wedding festivities. The absence of the former, and the"
17353,SECT. IX.,"occurrence of the latter, seem each to be more or less in the nature of"
17354,SECT. IX.,"an exception. With a wife returning to her parents, the dowry returned"
17355,SECT. IX.,"also[914]. On the other hand, to judge from the story of Vulcan and"
17356,SECT. IX.,"Venus, wherever adultery was committed, the guilty man was bound to pay"
17357,SECT. IX.,a fine[915]. The poems give us several instances where personal gifts
17358,SECT. IX.,"and energy served instead of wealth, as recommendations in suing for a"
17359,SECT. IX.,wife[916]. The drawing of the Bow affords a conspicuous example of the
17360,SECT. IX.,prevailing ideas.

17370,SECT. IX.,freedom and dignity of woman[917]. War was doubtless in this respect
17371,SECT. IX.,"her great enemy; she then became the prey of the strongest, and it"
17372,SECT. IX.,is probable that this may have been the most powerful instrument in

17382,SECT. IX.,that it was the mere banquet that created the conjugal relation: it
17383,SECT. IX.,"was doubtless the ἀμφάδιος γάμος, the solemn public acknowledgment, to"
17384,SECT. IX.,"which relatives and friends, and, in such a case as that of Hermione,"
17385,SECT. IX.,"the public or people of the state, thus became witnesses. This subject"

17393,SECT. IX.,facts of the heroic age to what may be called the natural perpetuity of
17394,SECT. IX.,the marriage contract.
17395,SECT. IX.,
17396,SECT. IX.,"It is a very remarkable circumstance, that, of the two great poems"

17399,SECT. IX.,
17400,SECT. IX.,Neither poem presents us with any case of a divorced wife; of a couple
17401,SECT. IX.,"between whom the marriage tie, after having once been duly formed,"
17402,SECT. IX.,had ceased to subsist. And each poem in its own way raises this
17403,SECT. IX.,"negative evidence to a form of the greatest cogency, from its happening"
17404,SECT. IX.,"to present the very circumstances under which, if under any, the"
17405,SECT. IX.,dissolution of the bond would have been acknowledged.

17407,SECT. IX.,"In the Iliad, the wife of Menelaus, his κουριδίη ἄλοχος, has been"
17408,SECT. IX.,living for many years in _de facto_ adultery with Paris. The line
17409,SECT. IX.,"between marriage on the one hand, and continued cohabitation together"
17410,SECT. IX.,"with public recognition on the other, being faintly drawn, Helen is"
17411,SECT. IX.,familiarly known in Troy as the wife of Paris; so she is called by the
17412,SECT. IX.,"Poet, and so she calls herself[918]. Menelaus, too, is described as"
17413,SECT. IX.,her former husband[919]. Whether this was a mere acquiescence in a
17414,SECT. IX.,"certain state of facts, or the regular result of more relaxed usages"
17415,SECT. IX.,"respecting marriage in Troy, may be doubtful. But it is clear that the"
17416,SECT. IX.,view of the Greeks was directly opposite. They never speak of Paris as
17417,SECT. IX.,"the husband of Helen. In their estimation, all the rights of Menelaus"
17418,SECT. IX.,"remained entire; and, as we shall see, it appears that, even while"
17419,SECT. IX.,"the possession of them was withheld from him, he acknowledged the"
17420,SECT. IX.,"reciprocal obligations. Nay, Hector himself seems to describe Helen"
17421,SECT. IX.,as still the wife of Menelaus; γνοίης χ’ οἵου φωτὸς ἔχεις θαλερὴν
17422,SECT. IX.,παράκοιτιν[920]. The war was (so to speak) juridically founded on the
17423,SECT. IX.,"fact, that the lawful marriage was not dissolved by adultery, even"
17424,SECT. IX.,with the addition of all that followed: that the relation of Helen to
17425,SECT. IX.,"her ancient husband was unchanged. Accordingly, Agamemnon recollects"
17426,SECT. IX.,"with pain, that if his brother should die, he will no longer be in a"
17427,SECT. IX.,"condition to demand her restoration, and to enforce it by arms, for his"
17428,SECT. IX.,soldiers will forthwith return home[921].

17446,SECT. IX.,
17447,SECT. IX.,It is plain that the Greeks heartily detested the crime of adultery:
17448,SECT. IX.,for one of the three great chapters of accusation against the Suitors
17449,SECT. IX.,"is, that they wooed the wife of Ulysses in his lifetime[922]. But it"
17450,SECT. IX.,"is not less plain that they knew nothing of the idea, that by that"
17451,SECT. IX.,crime it was placed in the power of any person to obtain or to confer
17452,SECT. IX.,a release from the obligations of marriage.

17459,SECT. IX.,"opposite doctrine to its extreme, and to say that no married person"
17460,SECT. IX.,"may remarry, except with demonstrative evidence of the death of the"
17461,SECT. IX.,"original husband or wife respectively. Probably, however, no period of"
17462,SECT. IX.,the world has exhibited a more stringent application of the doctrine
17463,SECT. IX.,"of indissolubility to the case of desertion, than that on which the"
17464,SECT. IX.,"plot of the Odyssey is founded; where, after an absence of the husband"
17465,SECT. IX.,"prolonged to the twentieth year, Penelope still waits his return; prays"
17466,SECT. IX.,that death may relieve her from the dread necessity of making a new
17467,SECT. IX.,"choice; and, thus directed by her own conscience and right feeling,"
17468,SECT. IX.,likewise apprehends condemnation by the public judgment in the event of

17506,SECT. IX.,but it will be observed that Homer does not furnish us with any trace
17507,SECT. IX.,"of this usage among the Greeks. The story of Phœnix probably implies,"
17508,SECT. IX.,that the connection of the same woman with a father and a son was
17509,SECT. IX.,incestuous; for the full efficacy of the remedy proposed by his mother
17510,SECT. IX.,"turns on the supposition, that there would remain to his father no"
17511,SECT. IX.,"alternative but incest after Phœnix had gained his object, and that"

17518,SECT. IX.,"an example of a marriage, by one shade yet less desirable, that of"
17519,SECT. IX.,"a man with his aunt. Tydeus, the father of Diomed, was married to a"

17528,SECT. IX.,
17529,SECT. IX.,We have also among the Trojans an example of a man’s marriage with his
17530,SECT. IX.,"aunt. Iphidamas, son of Antenor[931], was brought up in the house of"
17531,SECT. IX.,Cisses his maternal grandfather; and he contracted a marriage with his
17532,SECT. IX.,mother’s sister just before proceeding to the war.

17534,SECT. IX.,[931] Il. xi. 220-6.
17535,SECT. IX.,
17536,SECT. IX.,"At the same time, the law of incest is clearly a progressive one from"
17537,SECT. IX.,"the infancy of mankind onwards, and what we have to consider is not"
17538,SECT. IX.,"so much its precise extent, as the degree of genuine aversion with"
17539,SECT. IX.,which the violation of it is regarded. Upon this subject there can be
17540,SECT. IX.,"no doubt, when we read the passage in the Eleventh Odyssey respecting"
17541,SECT. IX.,"the μέγα ἔργον of Œdipus and Epicaste, and the fearful consequences"
17542,SECT. IX.,"which, though it was done in ignorance, it entailed upon them[932]. In"
17543,SECT. IX.,"principle, then, that restriction of the field of choice, which adds"
17544,SECT. IX.,"so greatly to the intimacy and firmness of the marriage tie, was fully"
17545,SECT. IX.,recognised in Greece.
17546,SECT. IX.,
17547,SECT. IX.,[932] Od. xi. 271-80.
17548,SECT. IX.,
17549,SECT. IX.,Neither do we want traces in Homer of that remarkable effect of the
17550,SECT. IX.,"unifying power of marriage, which confers upon each partner in the"
17551,SECT. IX.,"union an equal and common relation to the family of the other, by a"
17552,SECT. IX.,convention which has so much of the moral strength of fact. The most
17553,SECT. IX.,remarkable of all the indications upon this subject in the poems is
17554,SECT. IX.,"that, which relates to the future life of Menelaus. He is said to"
17555,SECT. IX.,be elected to the honour of a place in the region of Elysium after
17556,SECT. IX.,"this life, not in virtue of his own merits, but as being, through his"
17557,SECT. IX.,"marriage with Helen, the son-in-law of Jupiter."
17558,SECT. IX.,
17559,SECT. IX.,The recognition of relationships through the wife or husband to the
17560,SECT. IX.,"husband or wife respectively, and the existence of names to describe"
17561,SECT. IX.,"them, is a sign of the completeness of the union effected by the"
17562,SECT. IX.,"marriage tie. That these terms were not merely formal and ceremonious,"
17563,SECT. IX.,we may judge from the speech of Alcinous:
17564,SECT. IX.,
17565,SECT. IX.,ἦ τίς τοι καὶ πηὸς ἀπέφθιτο Ἰλιόθι πρὸ
17566,SECT. IX.,"ἐσθλὸς ἐὼν, γαμβρὸς ἢ πενθερὸς, οἵτε μάλιστα"

17571,SECT. IX.,Now of these words we have the following;

17573,SECT. IX.,"πηὸς, for any relative by affinity;"

17575,SECT. IX.,"ἐκυρὸς, πενθερὸς, father-in-law;"

17590,SECT. IX.,
17591,SECT. IX.,"And, lastly, we have εἰνατεὶρ, husband’s sister-in-law, a relationship"
17592,SECT. IX.,not expressed by any word in the English and many other languages. The
17593,SECT. IX.,εἰνατέρες are always separate from the γαλόῳ.
17594,SECT. IX.,
17595,SECT. IX.,The formation of this large circle of relationships by affinity is the
17596,SECT. IX.,correlative to a well-defined strictness in the marriage law. For these

17598,SECT. IX.,"breed confusion, unless marriage were perpetual and incest eschewed."
17599,SECT. IX.,
17600,SECT. IX.,"Friedreich[934] truly observes, that the law of incest, instead of"
17601,SECT. IX.,"being tightened, was relaxed at a later period in Greece; a very"
17602,SECT. IX.,"decided mark of moral retrogression, which cannot be cancelled by all"

17610,SECT. IX.,obligation practically observed in the Greece of the heroic age?
17611,SECT. IX.,
17612,SECT. IX.,"Part, at least, of the answer is easy to give. By women it was observed"
17613,SECT. IX.,"admirably. Except only in the case of Anteia, two generations old,"
17614,SECT. IX.,there is no instance in Homer of a woman who seeks the breach of
17615,SECT. IX.,"it. The forcible or half forcible seduction[935], and progressive"
17616,SECT. IX.,"contamination, of a part of the unmarried women who belong to the"
17617,SECT. IX.,"household of Ulysses, is one of the three great crimes which draw"
17618,SECT. IX.,down from Heaven such fearful vengeance upon the Suitors. Of the
17619,SECT. IX.,"παλλακὶς, we hear but twice in the poems; nor can we say that this word"
17620,SECT. IX.,"meant more than a concubine[936]. Among the Greek chieftains, cases"
17621,SECT. IX.,of homicide are more frequent than those of bastardy. And when such
17622,SECT. IX.,"instances are mentioned, it is not in the hardened manner of later"
17623,SECT. IX.,times.

17645,SECT. IX.,the chiefs is mentioned as having himself had an illegitimate son. This
17646,SECT. IX.,"son, who has the touching name of Megapenthes, was born to him by a"
17647,SECT. IX.,"slave, evidently after the rape of Helen; he was apparently recognised"
17648,SECT. IX.,in part; his marriage was celebrated at the same time with that of his
17649,SECT. IX.,"legitimate sister Hermione, but it was contracted with a person of"
17650,SECT. IX.,"lower station. He was τηλύγετος, the last as well as the first; though"

17661,SECT. IX.,to sovereignty in Greece disturbed by illegitimate offspring.
17662,SECT. IX.,
17663,SECT. IX.,The great majority of illegitimate births in Homer are those ascribed
17664,SECT. IX.,to the paternity of deities. It is probable that this extraction
17665,SECT. IX.,may be pleaded to cover sometimes marriages which were conceived to
17666,SECT. IX.,be beneath the station of the woman; sometimes instances like that
17667,SECT. IX.,"of Astyoche[940], when war had both excited passion, and provided"
17668,SECT. IX.,opportunities and victims for its gratification[941]. Setting these
17669,SECT. IX.,"cases aside, the cases of illegitimacy in heroic Greece appear to be"
17670,SECT. IX.,rare.

17677,SECT. IX.,"child (only, however, I think in the case of a son) is brought up"
17678,SECT. IX.,in a manner approaching to that of the legitimate offspring: and a
17679,SECT. IX.,"certain relationship is acknowledged to exist, for the wife is said"
17680,SECT. IX.,"to be μητρυίη, or step-mother, to the illegitimate son. In the case"
17681,SECT. IX.,"of Pedæus, it was Theano, Antenor’s wife, who herself educated the"
17682,SECT. IX.,bastard: but it is plain that in Troas concubinage was far more fully

17689,SECT. IX.,"this concubinage as being what it would have been with Priam, a matter"
17690,SECT. IX.,"of course and requiring no apology, but founds it upon his preferring"

17695,SECT. IX.,In the camp before the walls of Troy it certainly appears as if by
17696,SECT. IX.,"the use of the word γέρας, prize, Homer might, as it is commonly"
17697,SECT. IX.,"assumed, mean to indicate, for most of the principal chiefs, that they"
17698,SECT. IX.,had captives taken in war for concubines. But the point is far from
17699,SECT. IX.,"clear; and at any rate Menelaus, as is observed by Athenæus, forms"
17700,SECT. IX.,an exception[944]. This circumstance affords rather a marked proof
17701,SECT. IX.,of Greek ideas with respect to the durability of the marriage tie;
17702,SECT. IX.,"for that author is probably right in ascribing it to his being, as it"
17703,SECT. IX.,"were, in the presence of his wife Helen. This concubinage, however,"
17704,SECT. IX.,"appears to have been single in each case where it prevailed; or, if it"
17705,SECT. IX.,"was otherwise, Homer has at least deemed the circumstance unfit to be"
17706,SECT. IX.,recorded. There is no sign that the seven Lesbian damsels of Il. ix.

17714,SECT. IX.,in a peculiar degree. He calls her his ἄλοχον θυμάρεα[946]. It is said
17715,SECT. IX.,that the word ἄλοχος may mean a concubine[947]. I do not find any
17716,SECT. IX.,"passage in Homer, except this of Il. ix., where it may not with the"
17717,SECT. IX.,"most obvious propriety be translated ‘wife.’ It has its highest force,"
17718,SECT. IX.,"no doubt, in such expressions as μνηστὴ ἄλοχος and κουριδίη ἄλοχος:"
17719,SECT. IX.,even as we say intensively ‘wedded wife.’ But the term is the standing
17720,SECT. IX.,"phrase for wife, as much as τέκνα for children; and it is impossible,"
17721,SECT. IX.,consistently with what we see of the usages of marriage among the
17722,SECT. IX.,"Greeks, to suppose that the same term was alike applicable to wives"
17723,SECT. IX.,and concubines. Nor is it necessary to draw such a conclusion from
17724,SECT. IX.,"this passage. We might be tempted to suppose, that Achilles here puts"
17725,SECT. IX.,"a strain as it were upon the use of the word, and for the moment calls"
17726,SECT. IX.,"Briseis his wife, in order to prepare the way for the tremendous and"

17748,SECT. IX.,"and cares for his wife, becomes insipid, and the whole comparison with"

17751,SECT. IX.,
17752,SECT. IX.,"Probably the explanation may be, that she was designated for marriage"

17755,SECT. IX.,"bear up in her widowhood and captivity, promising that she should"

17758,SECT. IX.,"the ceremonial of marriage, should be celebrated on their return to"
17759,SECT. IX.,Phthia[949]. I should therefore suppose that we might with strict
17760,SECT. IX.,"justice render ἄλοχος, in Il. ix. 336, ‘my bride;’ always remembering"
17761,SECT. IX.,"that we are dealing with a relation that was not governed by rules, and"

17787,SECT. IX.,"The concubinage of the Greek chiefs, practised as it was during a long"

17792,SECT. IX.,
17793,SECT. IX.,The presence of a concubine within the precinct of the family seems to
17794,SECT. IX.,"have been differently viewed by the Greeks; for here, and here only,"
17795,SECT. IX.,do we find the disparaging word παλλακὶς (whence the Latin _pellex_)
17796,SECT. IX.,applied to a person in that position. The two cases of it are as
17797,SECT. IX.,follows. In one of them Ulysses feigns a story of his having been a
17798,SECT. IX.,"son of the Cretan Castor, born of a παλλακὶς, but (which he mentions"
17799,SECT. IX.,as a departure from the general rule) regarded by his father as much
17800,SECT. IX.,as were his legitimate children[951]. The other is the instance of
17801,SECT. IX.,Phœnix in the Ninth Iliad. Amyntor his father had an intended or actual
17802,SECT. IX.,"concubine; and, bestowing his affections on her, slighted the mother"
17803,SECT. IX.,"of his child. She, in resentment or self-defence, entreated her son"
17804,SECT. IX.,"Phœnix to cross or anticipate his father[952], and win the woman to his"
17805,SECT. IX.,own embraces[953]. He complied; and thus drew down upon himself the
17806,SECT. IX.,"dire wrath and curses of his father, which kindled his own anger in"
17807,SECT. IX.,"return; but he restrained himself from the act of parricide, and became"
17808,SECT. IX.,a fugitive instead. This legend is somewhat obscure; but it appears
17809,SECT. IX.,to indicate plainly that concubinage was not a recognised institution
17810,SECT. IX.,"among the Greeks, as it seems to have been among the Trojans."

17830,SECT. IX.,"freedom, and elevation of manners, which was the natural offspring"
17831,SECT. IX.,of a system in the main so sound and strict. The general tone of the
17832,SECT. IX.,relations of husband and wife in the Homeric poems is thoroughly
17833,SECT. IX.,"natural; it is full of dignity and warmth; a sort of noble deference,"
17834,SECT. IX.,reciprocally adjusted according to the position of the giver and
17835,SECT. IX.,"the receiver, prevails on either side. I will venture to add, it is"
17836,SECT. IX.,"full also of delicacy, though we must be content to distinguish,"
17837,SECT. IX.,"in considering this point, between what is essential and what is"
17838,SECT. IX.,"conventional, and must make some allowance for the directness and"
17839,SECT. IX.,simplicity of expression that characterized an artless age[955].
17840,SECT. IX.,
17841,SECT. IX.,"[955] See Friedreich, Realien, c. ii. §. 56. pp. 196-200, where this"
17842,SECT. IX.,subject is excellently treated.
17843,SECT. IX.,
17844,SECT. IX.,With this delicacy was combined a not less remarkable freedom in the
17845,SECT. IX.,Greek manners with respect to women. We find Penelope appearing in
17846,SECT. IX.,"her palace at will, on all ordinary occasions, before the Suitors;"
17847,SECT. IX.,"although, on the other hand, no woman would be present where any thing"
17848,SECT. IX.,"like license was to be exhibited, as we may judge from the case of the"
17849,SECT. IX.,lay of Demodocus in the Eighth Odyssey. The general freedom of woman is
17850,SECT. IX.,however most fully exhibited in the case of Nausicaa. She goes forth
17851,SECT. IX.,into the country with her maidens unattended. When Ulysses appears
17852,SECT. IX.,"there is no fear of him as a man, or even as a stranger, but only from"
17853,SECT. IX.,his condition at the moment. This difficulty she surmounts with a
17854,SECT. IX.,dignity which she could not have possessed by virtue of her personal
17855,SECT. IX.,"character only, nor except in a case where great liberty was habitually"
17856,SECT. IX.,and traditionally enjoyed by women.
17857,SECT. IX.,
17858,SECT. IX.,Her arrangement of the manner in which he is to enter the city apart

17861,SECT. IX.,"demand upon Ulysses for ζωάγρια, or salvage."
17862,SECT. IX.,
17863,SECT. IX.,"Again, how remarkable it is that Alcinous, far from being surprised"
17864,SECT. IX.,that his maiden daughter should have entered into conversation with
17865,SECT. IX.,"a stranger, is actually on the point of finding fault with her for"
17866,SECT. IX.,"not having shown a greater forwardness, and brought him home in"

17875,SECT. IX.,"tone of the intercourse maintained between men and women, that we are"
17876,SECT. IX.,really to judge what is the social position of the latter.
17877,SECT. IX.,
17878,SECT. IX.,And this tone it is which supplies such conclusive evidence with
17879,SECT. IX.,"respect to the age of Homer. Achilles observes, that love and care[957]"
17880,SECT. IX.,towards a wife are a matter of course with every right-minded man.
17881,SECT. IX.,"Love and care, indeed, may be shown to a pet animal. It is not on the"
17882,SECT. IX.,"mere words, therefore, that we must rest our conclusions; but upon"
17883,SECT. IX.,"the spirit in which they are spoken, and the whole circle of signs"
17884,SECT. IX.,with which they are associated. It is on the reciprocity of all those
17885,SECT. IX.,"sentiments between man and wife, father and daughter, son and mother,"
17886,SECT. IX.,which are connected with the moral dignity of the human being. It is
17887,SECT. IX.,"on the confidence exchanged between them, and the loving liberty of"
17888,SECT. IX.,advice and exhortation from the one to the other. The social equality
17889,SECT. IX.,"of man and woman is of course to be understood with reserves, as is"
17890,SECT. IX.,"that other equality, which nevertheless indicates a political truth of"
17891,SECT. IX.,"the utmost importance, the equality of all classes in the eye of the"
17892,SECT. IX.,law. There are differences in the nature and constitution of the two
17893,SECT. IX.,"great divisions of the race, to be met by adaptations of treatment"
17894,SECT. IX.,"and of occupation; without such adaptations, the seeming equality"
17895,SECT. IX.,"would be partiality alike dangerous and irrational. But, subject to"
17896,SECT. IX.,"those reserves, we find in Homer the fulness of moral and intelligent"
17897,SECT. IX.,"being alike consummate, alike acknowledged, on the one side and on the"
17898,SECT. IX.,"other. The conversation of Hector and Andromache in the Sixth Iliad,"
17899,SECT. IX.,"of Ulysses and Penelope in the Twenty-third Odyssey, the position of"
17900,SECT. IX.,"Arete at the court of Alcinous, and that of Helen in the palace of"
17901,SECT. IX.,"Menelaus, all tell one and the same tale. Ulysses, for example, where"
17902,SECT. IX.,"he wishes to convey his supplication in Scheria to the King, does it by"
17903,SECT. IX.,falling at the Queen’s feet: but she does not supplicate her husband:
17904,SECT. IX.,"the address to her seems to have sufficed. And Helen appears, in the"
17905,SECT. IX.,"palace of Menelaus, on such a footing relatively to her husband, as"
17906,SECT. IX.,"would perfectly befit the present relations of man and woman. Nay, we"
17907,SECT. IX.,"may take the speech of Helen in the Sixth Iliad, addressed to Hector,"
17908,SECT. IX.,"where she touches on the character of Paris, as equal to any of them"
17909,SECT. IX.,by way of social indication. What we there read is not the sagacity or
17910,SECT. IX.,"intelligence of the speaker, but it is the right of the wife (so to"
17911,SECT. IX.,"call her) to speak about the character of her husband and its failings,"
17912,SECT. IX.,her acknowledged possession of the standing ground from which she can
17913,SECT. IX.,"so speak, and speak with firmness, nay, even with an authority of her"
17914,SECT. IX.,own.

17922,SECT. IX.,the army not to quit Troy until they had forced the Trojan matrons

17925,SECT. IX.,"in times of violence, most of all, too, after the sack of a city, and"
17926,SECT. IX.,what belongs to the age of Homer in particular. After this separation
17927,SECT. IX.,"has been effected, there remains nothing which ought to depress our"
17928,SECT. IX.,"views of the position of woman in the heroic age. The sons of Priam,"
17929,SECT. IX.,"princes of Troy, were sold into captivity by Achilles as he took"
17930,SECT. IX.,them[958]: of course the purchasers put them to menial employments.
17931,SECT. IX.,"Not only so, but Eumæus, the faithful swineherd and slave of Ulysses,"
17932,SECT. IX.,was by birth royal: his father Ctesios was king of two wealthy and
17933,SECT. IX.,"happy cities[959]. From the name Εὐρυμέδουσα, it would appear probable"

17946,SECT. IX.,"a woman, but for her vice and insolence. The conduct of the Ithacan"
17947,SECT. IX.,"Suitors to Penelope, as it is represented in the Odyssey, affords the"
17948,SECT. IX.,strongest evidence of the respect in which women were held. Her son had
17949,SECT. IX.,been a child: there was no strong party of adherents to the family; yet
17950,SECT. IX.,"the highflown insolence of the Suitors, demanding that she should marry"

17956,SECT. IX.,"of conjugal attachments which, from all that has preceded, we might"
17957,SECT. IX.,"expect. While admitting the superior beauty of Calypso as an Immortal,"
17958,SECT. IX.,Ulysses frankly owns to her that his heart is pining every day for
17959,SECT. IX.,Penelope[961]. It is the highest honour of a hero to die fighting
17960,SECT. IX.,on behalf of his wife and children. The continuance of domestic
17961,SECT. IX.,"happiness, and the concord of man and wife, is a blessing so great,"
17962,SECT. IX.,"that it excites the envy of the gods, and they interrupt it by some"
17963,SECT. IX.,adverse dispensation[962]. And no wonder; for nothing has earth to
17964,SECT. IX.,"offer better, than when man and wife dwell together in unity of spirit:"
17965,SECT. IX.,"their friends rejoice, their foes repine: the human heart has nothing"
17966,SECT. IX.,more to desire[963]. There is here apparently involved that great and
17967,SECT. IX.,"characteristic idea of the conjugal relation, that it includes and"
17968,SECT. IX.,concentrates in itself all other loves. And this very idea is expressed
17969,SECT. IX.,"by Andromache, where, after relating the slaughter of her family by"
17970,SECT. IX.,"Achilles, she tells Hector, ‘Hector, nay but thou art for me a father,"

17990,SECT. IX.,~_Woman-characters of Homer._~
17991,SECT. IX.,
17992,SECT. IX.,"With the pictures which we thus find largely scattered over the poems,"
17993,SECT. IX.,"of the relations of woman to others, the characters which Homer has"
17994,SECT. IX.,given us of woman herself are in thorough harmony. Among his living
17995,SECT. IX.,"characters we do not find the viragos, the termagants, the incarnate"
17996,SECT. IX.,"fiends, of the later legends. Nay, the woman of Homer never dreams"
17997,SECT. IX.,"of using violence, even as a protection against wrong. It must be"
17998,SECT. IX.,"admitted, that he does not even present to us the heroine in any more"
17999,SECT. IX.,"pronounced form, than that of the moral endurance of Penelope. The"
18000,SECT. IX.,"heroine proper, the Joan of Arc, is certainly a noble creation: but"
18001,SECT. IX.,"yet one perhaps implying a state of things more abnormal, than that"
18002,SECT. IX.,which had been reached by the Greeks of the Homeric age. The pictures
18003,SECT. IX.,"of women, which Homer presents to us, are perfect pictures; but they"
18004,SECT. IX.,"are pictures simply of mothers, matrons, sisters, daughters, maidens,"
18005,SECT. IX.,wives. The description which the Poet has given us of the violence
18006,SECT. IX.,"and depravity of Clytemnestra, is the genuine counterpart of his high"
18007,SECT. IX.,conception of the nature of woman[966]:
18008,SECT. IX.,
18009,SECT. IX.,[966] Od. xi. 427.
18010,SECT. IX.,
18011,SECT. IX.,"ὣς οὐκ αἰνότερον καὶ κύντερον ἄλλο γυναικὸς,"
18012,SECT. IX.,ἥτις δὴ τοιαῦτα μετὰ φρεσὶν ἔργα βάληται.
18013,SECT. IX.,
18014,SECT. IX.,"For, in proportion as that nature is elevated and pure, does it become"
18015,SECT. IX.,"more shameful and degraded when, by a total suppression of its better"
18016,SECT. IX.,"instincts, it has been given over to wickedness."
18017,SECT. IX.,
18018,SECT. IX.,"Of the minor infirmities of our nature, as well as of its grosser"
18019,SECT. IX.,"faults, the women of Homer betray much less than the men. Nowhere has"
18020,SECT. IX.,he introduced into a prominent position the character of a vicious
18021,SECT. IX.,woman. The only instance of the kind is among a portion of the female
18022,SECT. IX.,"attendants in the palace of Ulysses, where, out of fifty, no more"
18023,SECT. IX.,"than twelve were at last the willing tools, having at first[967]"
18024,SECT. IX.,"been the reluctant victims, of the lust of the proud and rapacious"
18025,SECT. IX.,"band of Suitors. Clytemnestra, indeed, appears as a lofty criminal"
18026,SECT. IX.,"in the perspective of the poem, but her wickedness, too, is wholly"
18027,SECT. IX.,"derivative. Ægisthus corrupts her by a long course of effort, for,"
18028,SECT. IX.,"as Homer informs us, she had been a right-minded person; φρεσὶ γὰρ"
18029,SECT. IX.,κέχρητ’ ἀγαθῇσι[968]. On the one side we have only to place her and
18030,SECT. IX.,"the saucy slut Melantho; on the other, we have Andromache, Hecuba, and"
18031,SECT. IX.,"Briseis in the Iliad; in the Odyssey, Penelope and Euryclea, Arete"
18032,SECT. IX.,"and Nausicaa; the slightly drawn figures, such as that of the mother"
18033,SECT. IX.,"of Ulysses in the Eleventh Odyssey, are in the same spirit as the"
18034,SECT. IX.,more full delineations. There is not a single case in the poems to
18035,SECT. IX.,"qualify the observation, first, that the woman of Homer is profoundly"
18036,SECT. IX.,"feminine: secondly, that she is commonly the prop of virtue, rarely the"
18037,SECT. IX.,"instrument, and (in this reversing the order of the first temptation)"
18038,SECT. IX.,"never the source, of corruption."
18039,SECT. IX.,
18040,SECT. IX.,[967] Od. xxii. 37.
18041,SECT. IX.,
18042,SECT. IX.,[968] Od. iii. 266.
18043,SECT. IX.,
18044,SECT. IX.,"In company with all that we have seen, we likewise find that the"
18045,SECT. IX.,"limits of the position of woman are carefully marked, and that she"
18046,SECT. IX.,fully comprehends them. There is nowhere throughout the poems a single
18047,SECT. IX.,"effort at self-assertion: the ground that she holds, she holds without"
18048,SECT. IX.,"dispute. If at any point a stumblingblock could be likely to be found,"
18049,SECT. IX.,"it would be between a mother just parting with her authority, and"
18050,SECT. IX.,"a son newly come of age. Yet Penelope and Telemachus never clash,"
18051,SECT. IX.,"and thoroughly understand one another. Again, the Homeric man, even"
18052,SECT. IX.,"the Homeric good man, is sometimes the subject of hasty, vehement,"
18053,SECT. IX.,and tumultuous passions; the woman never. She finds her power in
18054,SECT. IX.,gentleness; she rules with a silken thread; she is eminent for the
18055,SECT. IX.,"uniformity of her self-command, and for the observance of measure in"
18056,SECT. IX.,all the relations of life. The misogynism which marked Euripides and
18057,SECT. IX.,"other later writers has, and could have, no place in Homer: the moral"
18058,SECT. IX.,"standard of his women is higher than that of his men; their office,"
18059,SECT. IX.,"which they perform without fault, is to love and to minister, and their"
18060,SECT. IX.,reward to lean on those whom they serve.
18061,SECT. IX.,
18062,SECT. IX.,The lower aspect of the relation between the two sexes is in the poems
18063,SECT. IX.,wholly secondary. All that tends to sensualize it is commonly repelled
18064,SECT. IX.,"or hidden, and, when brought into mention at all, is yet carefully and"
18065,SECT. IX.,"anxiously depressed. Even the cases of exception, which lie beyond the"
18066,SECT. IX.,"pale of marriage, are kept in a certain analogy with it, and are as"
18067,SECT. IX.,"far as possible removed from the promiscuous and brutal indulgence,"
18068,SECT. IX.,"which marked the later Pagan ages, including those of the greatest"
18069,SECT. IX.,"pride and splendour, and which still so deeply taints the societies of"
18070,SECT. IX.,Christendom.
18071,SECT. IX.,
18072,SECT. IX.,"We may find, if it be needed, some further evidence of the high"
18073,SECT. IX.,position of woman upon earth in the relation subsisting between the
18074,SECT. IX.,Homeric gods and goddesses respectively. For that relation approaches
18075,SECT. IX.,"as nearly as may be to equality in force and intelligence, while in"
18076,SECT. IX.,"purity the latter are on the whole superior. After Jupiter, the deities"
18077,SECT. IX.,"most elevated in Homer are, Juno and Minerva, Neptune and Apollo; and"
18078,SECT. IX.,"of all these, I think, we must consider Minerva to have stood first in"
18079,SECT. IX.,"his estimation. This arrangement could not but harmonize with, while it"
18080,SECT. IX.,"also serves to measure, his ideas of the earthly place and character of"
18081,SECT. IX.,woman.
18082,SECT. IX.,
18083,SECT. IX.,A similar inference is suggested by the tendency of the Greeks to
18084,SECT. IX.,"enshrine many ideas, sometimes great, and occasionally both great and"
18085,SECT. IX.,"good, in feminine impersonations."
18086,SECT. IX.,
18087,SECT. IX.,"We will, lastly, inquire into the employments of women in the heroic"
18088,SECT. IX.,age; both to ascertain how nearly they could approach to the summits
18089,SECT. IX.,"of society, and also what was their general share in the division of"
18090,SECT. IX.,occupations.
18091,SECT. IX.,
18092,SECT. IX.,~_Women were admitted to sovereignty._~
18093,SECT. IX.,
18094,SECT. IX.,"Among nations where war, homicide, and piracy so extensively prevailed,"
18095,SECT. IX.,"it is certainly deserving of peculiar consideration, that we should"
18096,SECT. IX.,find any traces of the exercise of sovereignty by a woman. There are
18097,SECT. IX.,"however three cases in the poems, which in a greater or less degree"
18098,SECT. IX.,serve to imply that it was neither unknown nor wholly unfamiliar.
18099,SECT. IX.,
18100,SECT. IX.,"1. Andromache states, that her mother was queen in Hypoplacian Thebes."
18101,SECT. IX.,The word is βασίλευεν[969]. It implies more than being the mere wife of
18102,SECT. IX.,"a king; though, as it was during the life time of her husband Eetion,"
18103,SECT. IX.,we cannot justly infer from it that there was here any exercise of
18104,SECT. IX.,"independent sovereign power. It is the only instance in the Iliad,"
18105,SECT. IX.,"where we have any word, that has βασιλεὺς for its basis, applied to a"
18106,SECT. IX.,woman.
18107,SECT. IX.,
18108,SECT. IX.,[969] Il. vi. 425.
18109,SECT. IX.,
18110,SECT. IX.,"2. The common tradition is, that Jason acquired possession of Lemnos"
18111,SECT. IX.,by marriage with Hypsipyle its queen. This is so far supported by
18112,SECT. IX.,"Homer that, while Jason clearly appears in the poems as a Greek,"
18113,SECT. IX.,"we notwithstanding find his son sovereign of Lemnos, without any"
18114,SECT. IX.,"indication of a conquest or regular migration, and Hypsipyle is"
18115,SECT. IX.,"mentioned as his mother. The simple fact that the mother, contrary"
18116,SECT. IX.,"to Homer’s usual practice, is in this case named as well as the"
18117,SECT. IX.,"father, raises a presumption that it is because she had reigned in the"
18118,SECT. IX.,island[970].

18122,SECT. IX.,"In the Eleventh Odyssey we are told that Neleus, the younger of the two"
18123,SECT. IX.,"illegitimate sons of Tyro, came to dwell in Pylos, and that he married"
18124,SECT. IX.,"Chloris, the youngest daughter of Amphion an Iasid, giving large"
18125,SECT. IX.,"presents to obtain her hand[971]. The text proceeds,"

18130,SECT. IX.,
18131,SECT. IX.,This may mean that she became his queen when he was king of Pylos: or
18132,SECT. IX.,it may mean that he became her husband when she was already queen there.
18133,SECT. IX.,
18134,SECT. IX.,"The Odyssey discloses to us the manner in which, under circumstances"
18135,SECT. IX.,"like those of the Trojan war, sovereign power would naturally pass into"
18136,SECT. IX.,female hands otherwise than by inheritance.
18137,SECT. IX.,
18138,SECT. IX.,"It would appear that, when Agamemnon set sail for Troy, he left"
18139,SECT. IX.,Clytemnestra in charge of his affairs as well as of his young son
18140,SECT. IX.,"Orestes, only taking the precaution to provide her with a trustworthy"
18141,SECT. IX.,counsellor in the person of his Bard[972]. As it was by inveigling
18142,SECT. IX.,"Clytemnestra that Ægisthus obtained the sovereign power, she must"
18143,SECT. IX.,evidently have been its depository.

18145,SECT. IX.,[972] Od. iii. 263-8.
18146,SECT. IX.,
18147,SECT. IX.,"In like manner it would appear, that Penelope was left in charge"
18148,SECT. IX.,"of Telemachus by Ulysses when he went to Troy, and that Mentor was"
18149,SECT. IX.,"appointed to perform for her some such friendly office, as that which"
18150,SECT. IX.,"the Bard undertook for Clytemnestra. The statement here is, that"
18151,SECT. IX.,Ulysses committed to him authority over his whole household[973].
18152,SECT. IX.,But it is plain that Penelope had the indoor management; since
18153,SECT. IX.,Telemachus speaks of the mode in which she regulated the reception of
18154,SECT. IX.,"strangers[974], and we hear of her rule in other matters[975]. Here we"
18155,SECT. IX.,"see openings for the natural formation of the word βασίλισσα, which"
18156,SECT. IX.,"seems originally to have meant, not a king’s wife merely, but a woman"
18157,SECT. IX.,in the actual exercise of royal authority; and which first appears in
18158,SECT. IX.,the Odyssey.

18165,SECT. IX.,
18166,SECT. IX.,The ordinary occupation of women of the highest rank in the poems is
18167,SECT. IX.,"undoubtedly to sit engaged, along with their maidens of the household,"
18168,SECT. IX.,"in spinning, weaving, or embroidery. Thus we find it with Helen,"
18169,SECT. IX.,"Penelope, and Andromache. But when Hector bids Andromache retire to"
18170,SECT. IX.,"these duties, he speaks of them in contradistinction not to all other"
18171,SECT. IX.,"duties, but to war, which, as he says, is the affair of men. Even this"
18172,SECT. IX.,"rule, however, was subject to exception. The Bellerophon of Homer"
18173,SECT. IX.,fights with the Amazons[976]; and the part taken by the goddesses in
18174,SECT. IX.,"the Theomachy shows, that the idea of women-soldiers was not wholly"
18175,SECT. IX.,"strange to his mind; as it is in fact to this day, I believe, less"
18176,SECT. IX.,attractively exemplified in the African kingdom of Dahomey. But manual
18177,SECT. IX.,"employments, taken alone, would not afford a just criterion. The"
18178,SECT. IX.,"dialogues of the speeches clearly show that then, as now, the woman was"
18179,SECT. IX.,concerned in all that concerned her husband.

18183,SECT. IX.,~_And to the service of the gods._~
18184,SECT. IX.,
18185,SECT. IX.,"Next to political supremacy, we may naturally inquire how far women"
18186,SECT. IX.,were qualified for the service of the gods.
18187,SECT. IX.,
18188,SECT. IX.,"We have various signs, more or less clear, of their sharing in it. The"
18189,SECT. IX.,reference to the Nurses of Dionysus cannot be wholly without force in
18190,SECT. IX.,this direction. The abstraction of Alcyone by Apollo has probably a
18191,SECT. IX.,"more positive connection with female ministry. But we are provided,"
18192,SECT. IX.,"as far as Troy at least is concerned, with one clear and conclusive"
18193,SECT. IX.,"instance. The Sixth Iliad affords us a glimpse of a female priesthood,"
18194,SECT. IX.,"and a worship confined to women, that subsisted among the Trojans."
18195,SECT. IX.,"Helenus, alarmed at the feats of Diomed, urges Hector to desire Hecuba"
18196,SECT. IX.,"to collect the aged women for a procession to the temple of Athene,"
18197,SECT. IX.,"with a robe for a gift, and with the promise of a hecatomb (Il. vi."
18198,SECT. IX.,"75-101). Hector then acquaints the troops, that he was going to"
18199,SECT. IX.,desire the old counsellors and the matrons of the city to supplicate
18200,SECT. IX.,"the deities, and to promise hecatombs (iii. 15). There seems to be"
18201,SECT. IX.,"something of policy in the way in which he thus generalizes, for the"
18202,SECT. IX.,"army, his account of the design: perhaps afraid of the effect that"
18203,SECT. IX.,"might be produced by its peculiar character. When he finds Hecuba, he"
18204,SECT. IX.,lays upon her precisely the injunction that Helenus had recommended.
18205,SECT. IX.,She sends her female servants to collect the aged women through the
18206,SECT. IX.,"city (286, 7). She leads them to the temple of Athene in the citadel."
18207,SECT. IX.,"They are there received by Theano, who had been appointed, apparently"
18208,SECT. IX.,"by the Trojan public[977], priestess to that deity. Theano takes the"
18209,SECT. IX.,"robe from Hecuba, and herself offers it and prays. Her prayer is for"
18210,SECT. IX.,"the city, and not for the men by name, but for the wives and infants:"
18211,SECT. IX.,"and her promise is, _we_ will sacrifice, ἱερεύσομεν, twelve, not oxen,"
18212,SECT. IX.,"but heifers, yearlings, untouched by the goad (Il. vi. 296-310). Thus"
18213,SECT. IX.,the feminine element runs apart through the whole.
18214,SECT. IX.,
18215,SECT. IX.,[977] Eustath. in loc.
18216,SECT. IX.,
18217,SECT. IX.,We have no reason to conclude that this order of things was
18218,SECT. IX.,exceptional; for though the time was one of peculiar danger and
18219,SECT. IX.,"emergency, the temple, the worship, and the priesthood stand before us"
18220,SECT. IX.,as belonging to the regular institutions of Troy.
18221,SECT. IX.,
18222,SECT. IX.,"We have no case like that of Theano among the Greeks. It could, indeed,"
18223,SECT. IX.,hardly be expected; as priesthood had not yet grown to be an Hellenic
18224,SECT. IX.,"institution. Yet, while the direct force of the narrative speaks for"
18225,SECT. IX.,"Troy alone, we are justified in giving it a more general significance,"
18226,SECT. IX.,because the Greek woman is apparently rather before than behind the
18227,SECT. IX.,"Trojan one in influence, and in the substantiveness of her position."
18228,SECT. IX.,
18229,SECT. IX.,In the Trojan genealogy[978] no notice is taken of women; nor have
18230,SECT. IX.,we any means of judging whether they were regarded as capable of
18231,SECT. IX.,"succession to the throne, or what was their political and historical"
18232,SECT. IX.,importance. But among the Greek races this was clearly great. The large
18233,SECT. IX.,"number of women whom Homer has introduced in the realm of Aides, and"
18234,SECT. IX.,"the parts assigned to them, are plain indications of their important"

18320,SECT. IX.,
18321,SECT. IX.,Thus far all is easy and becoming; but an apparent difficulty confronts
18322,SECT. IX.,"us when we find, that it was the usage for women to undertake certain"
18323,SECT. IX.,duties connected with the bathing of men. Sometimes this was done by
18324,SECT. IX.,servants; thus it was managed for Telemachus and Pisistratus in the
18325,SECT. IX.,"palace of Menelaus, and for Ulysses in that of the Phæacian king. On"
18326,SECT. IX.,"the other hand, it was sometimes an office of hospitality rendered by"
18327,SECT. IX.,"women, and even by young damsels, of the highest rank, to distinguished"
18328,SECT. IX.,"strangers of their own age or otherwise. Polycaste, the young and fair"
18329,SECT. IX.,"daughter of Nestor, (as the text is commonly interpreted,) bathed"
18330,SECT. IX.,"and anointed Telemachus, and put on him a cloak and vest[990]. Helen"
18331,SECT. IX.,"herself, when she was living in Troy, performed the like offices for"
18332,SECT. IX.,"Ulysses, on the occasion of his mission thither in the disguise of a"
18333,SECT. IX.,beggar[991]:

18355,SECT. IX.,"need of a defence, Eustathius does not supply one by pleading, that"
18356,SECT. IX.,"it was the custom of the time, and that the Pylian princess doubtless"
18357,SECT. IX.,acted by the command of her father[995]. What is wanted appears to me

18389,SECT. IX.,The words commonly employed by Homer in this matter refer to two
18390,SECT. IX.,"separate parts of the operation: first, the bathing and anointing, then"
18391,SECT. IX.,the dressing. They are commonly for the first λούω and χρίω: for the
18392,SECT. IX.,"second βάλλω, with the names of the proper vestments added (Od. iii."
18393,SECT. IX.,467);
18394,SECT. IX.,
18395,SECT. IX.,ἀμφὶ δέ μιν φᾶρος[998] καλὸν βάλεν ἠδὲ χιτῶνα.
18396,SECT. IX.,
18397,SECT. IX.,"[998] Or χλαῖναν, as in Od. x. 365."
18398,SECT. IX.,
18399,SECT. IX.,"But the whole question, in my view, really depends upon this: whether"
18400,SECT. IX.,"the verbs used mean the performance of a particular operation, or the"
18401,SECT. IX.,giving to the person concerned the means of doing it for himself.
18402,SECT. IX.,"Just as by feeding the poor, we mean giving them wherewithal to feed"
18403,SECT. IX.,"themselves. This is the suggestion of Wakefield[999], and I believe it"
18404,SECT. IX.,to be the satisfactory and conclusive solution of the whole question.
18405,SECT. IX.,We might be prevailed upon to travel a good way in company with Heroic
18406,SECT. IX.,"simplicity, and yet not quite be able to reach the point which the"
18407,SECT. IX.,opposite interpretation would require.
18408,SECT. IX.,
18409,SECT. IX.,"[999] On Pope, Od. iii. 464-8."
18410,SECT. IX.,
18411,SECT. IX.,"I think that the construction, which I have indicated as the proper"
18412,SECT. IX.,"one, is conclusively made good, first by the general rules for the"
18413,SECT. IX.,"sense of the words λούω, λούομαι, and kindred words in Homer: and"
18414,SECT. IX.,"secondly, by the detailed evidence of facts."
18415,SECT. IX.,
18416,SECT. IX.,"When the guests at a feast wash their hands, the standard expression"
18417,SECT. IX.,"is in the middle voice, χερνίψαντο δ’ ἔπειτα. When Ulysses and Diomed"
18418,SECT. IX.,"washed in the sea, the expression is ἱδρῶ ἀπενίζοντο: when they"
18419,SECT. IX.,"afterwards bathed and anointed themselves, it is λούσαντο, λοεσσαμένω,"
18420,SECT. IX.,ἀλειψαμένω[1000]. To smear arrows with poison is ἰοὺς χρίεσθαι
18421,SECT. IX.,"χαλκήρεας[1001]. For the maidens of Nausicaa, when they bathe and are"
18422,SECT. IX.,"anointed, we have λοεσσάμεναι and χρισάμεναι[1002]. In fact the usage"
18423,SECT. IX.,is general.

18430,SECT. IX.,
18431,SECT. IX.,The case stands rather differently with βάλλω. Here the active usage
18432,SECT. IX.,"is, I believe, the common one. But there is ample authority for the"
18433,SECT. IX.,"converse or active use of the middle voice, which corresponds with the"
18434,SECT. IX.,"middle use of the active. As for instance,"
18435,SECT. IX.,
18436,SECT. IX.,αὐτίκα δ’ ἀμφ’ ὤμοισιν ἐβάλλετο κάμπυλα τόξα[1003].

18439,SECT. IX.,
18440,SECT. IX.,There can therefore surely be no reason to doubt that βάλλειν in this
18441,SECT. IX.,"place follows the inclination of the leading words of the passages,"
18442,SECT. IX.,"and signifies, that as the water and the oil, so likewise the fresh"
18443,SECT. IX.,"clothing to put on, were given by the damsel for the purpose, but by no"
18444,SECT. IX.,"means that the operations, or any of them, were actually performed by"
18445,SECT. IX.,her.
18446,SECT. IX.,
18447,SECT. IX.,"If the word βάλλειν meant ‘to put on,’ there would be, as"
18448,SECT. IX.,"Eustathius[1004] observes, an ὑστερολογία, for the χίτων was as a"
18449,SECT. IX.,matter of course put on before the φᾶρος. But if it means ‘to give for
18450,SECT. IX.,"the purpose of putting on,’ then there is no solecism in the mode of"
18451,SECT. IX.,expression.

18454,SECT. IX.,
18455,SECT. IX.,"We must not, however, pass by the case of Circe in the Tenth Odyssey,"
18456,SECT. IX.,"where, as we have seen, it is stated that the water was actually poured"
18457,SECT. IX.,by the Sorceress over the head and shoulders of Ulysses. It is also
18458,SECT. IX.,"true that the old word λοέω, equivalent to λούω, is used there in the"
18459,SECT. IX.,active voice.
18460,SECT. IX.,
18461,SECT. IX.,Upon this I observe three things:
18462,SECT. IX.,
18463,SECT. IX.,"1. The statement that the water was poured over his head and shoulders,"
18464,SECT. IX.,"as he sat in the bath, evidently implies that what may be called"
18465,SECT. IX.,essential decency was preserved.
18466,SECT. IX.,
18467,SECT. IX.,"2. Even if it were not so, we could not in this point argue from the"
18468,SECT. IX.,manners or morals of a Phœnician goddess to those of a Greek damsel.
18469,SECT. IX.,
18470,SECT. IX.,"3. The meaning probably of λοέω is middle, in this as well as in the"
18471,SECT. IX.,"other cases: she gave him water to wash with, pouring it over his head"
18472,SECT. IX.,"and shoulders, and then leaving to him the substance of the operation,"
18473,SECT. IX.,which was not completed by this mere act of affusion.

18479,SECT. IX.,
18480,SECT. IX.,1. In Od. vii. 296. Ulysses says that Nausicaa (according to the
18481,SECT. IX.,popular construction of the term) bathed him: καὶ λοῦσ’ ἐν ποταμῷ.
18482,SECT. IX.,
18483,SECT. IX.,"2. But from Od. vi. 210, we find that what she did was not to"
18484,SECT. IX.,"bathe him, but to give orders to her attendants that he should be"
18485,SECT. IX.,"bathed,--that is, should be provided with the requisites for bathing."
18486,SECT. IX.,"Her words were, λούσατέ τ’ ἐν ποταμῷ, ὅθ’ ἐπὶ σκέπας ἔστ’ ἀνέμοιο."
18487,SECT. IX.,
18488,SECT. IX.,"3. Upon this they took him to a recess, gave him clothing and oil,"
18489,SECT. IX.,"and bid him bathe himself, ἤνωγον δ’ ἄρα μιν λοῦσθαι: upon which he"
18490,SECT. IX.,"requested them to stand off, as otherwise he could not proceed: ἄντην"
18491,SECT. IX.,δ’ οὐκ ἂν ἐγώγε λοέσσομαι (ibid. 218-22).
18492,SECT. IX.,
18493,SECT. IX.,"It would appear therefore, that the statements of Homer give no ground"
18494,SECT. IX.,whatever for sinister or disparaging imputation. His pictures do not
18495,SECT. IX.,entirely correspond with modern ideas: but they may well leave on our
18496,SECT. IX.,"minds the impression that, in the period he described, if the standard"
18497,SECT. IX.,"of appearances in this department was lower, that of positive thought"
18498,SECT. IX.,"and action was higher, as well as simpler, than in our own day."

18618,SECT. X.,"different. The Holy Scriptures are like a thin stream, beginning from"
18619,SECT. X.,"the very fountain-head of our race, and gradually, but continuously"
18620,SECT. X.,"finding their way through an extended solitude, into times otherwise"
18621,SECT. X.,"known, and into the general current of the fortunes of mankind. The"
18622,SECT. X.,"Homeric poems are like a broad lake outstretched in the distance, which"
18623,SECT. X.,"provides us with a mirror of one particular age and people, alike full"
18624,SECT. X.,"and marvellous, but which is entirely dissociated by an interval of"
18625,SECT. X.,"many generations from any other records, except such as are of the"
18626,SECT. X.,most partial and fragmentary kind. In respect of the influence which
18627,SECT. X.,"they have respectively exercised upon mankind, it might appear almost"
18628,SECT. X.,"profane to compare them. In this point of view, the Scriptures stand"
18629,SECT. X.,"so far apart from every other production, on account of their great"
18630,SECT. X.,"offices in relation to the coming of the Redeemer, and to the spiritual"
18631,SECT. X.,"training of mankind, that there can be nothing either like or second to"
18632,SECT. X.,them.
18633,SECT. X.,
18634,SECT. X.,"But undoubtedly, after however wide an interval, the Homeric poems thus"
18635,SECT. X.,"far at least stand in a certain relation to the Scriptures, that no"
18636,SECT. X.,other work of man can be compared to them. Their immediate influence
18637,SECT. X.,has been great; but that influence which they have mediately exercised
18638,SECT. X.,"through their share in shaping the mind and nationality of Greece,"
18639,SECT. X.,"and again, through Greece upon the world, cannot readily be reduced"
18640,SECT. X.,to measure: _Les vraies origines de l’esprit humain sont là; tous les
18641,SECT. X.,nobles de l’intelligence y retrouvent la patrie de leurs pères_[1013].
18642,SECT. X.,"Insomuch that, passing over the vast interval between those purposes"
18643,SECT. X.,"which concern salvation, and every other purpose connected with man,"
18644,SECT. X.,"this remains to be admitted, that there is a relative parallelism"
18645,SECT. X.,between the oldest Holy Scriptures and the works of Homer. For each
18646,SECT. X.,of them stands at the head of the class of powers to which they
18647,SECT. X.,"respectively belong; and the minor seems to present to our view, as"
18648,SECT. X.,"well as the major one, the indications of a distinct Providential aim"
18649,SECT. X.,that was to be attained through its means.

18653,SECT. X.,"The relation, however, of the Homeric poems to the earlier portion of"
18654,SECT. X.,"the Sacred Scriptures, appears to me to be capable of being represented"
18655,SECT. X.,in a more determinate form than it assumes when they are merely
18656,SECT. X.,"compared as being respectively the oldest known compositions, and as"
18657,SECT. X.,each confirming the testimony of the other by numerous coincidences of
18658,SECT. X.,manners.

18662,SECT. X.,"For the Eastern world, it is, I suppose, generally acknowledged that"
18663,SECT. X.,"we ought to regard Mahometanism as having had, no less than Judaism,"
18664,SECT. X.,"a place, though doubtless a very different place, in the determinate"
18665,SECT. X.,"counsels of God. So in the West, we must view the extraordinary"
18666,SECT. X.,"developments, which human nature received, both individually and in"
18667,SECT. X.,"its social forms, among the Greeks and Romans, as having been intended"
18668,SECT. X.,to fulfil high Providential purposes. They supplied materials for the
18669,SECT. X.,"intellectual and social portions of that European civilization, which"
18670,SECT. X.,derives its spiritual substance from the Christian Faith. And they
18671,SECT. X.,wrought out solutions apparently conclusive for the questions which
18672,SECT. X.,"absolutely required an answer, as to the capacity or incapacity of man,"
18673,SECT. X.,"when without the aid of especial divine light and guidance, to work out"
18674,SECT. X.,"his own happiness and peace. That Divine Word, which tells us that the"
18675,SECT. X.,"Redeemer came in the fulness of time, indirectly points to the great"
18676,SECT. X.,"transactions which filled the space of ages since the Fall, when time"
18677,SECT. X.,was not yet full; and the greatest of all those great transactions
18678,SECT. X.,"surely were the parts played by Greece and Rome, as the representatives"
18679,SECT. X.,"of humanity at large in its most vigorous developments. They too, as"
18680,SECT. X.,"well as the discipline of the Jewish people, doubtless belonged to the"
18681,SECT. X.,Divine plan. All these varied manifestations may differ much in their
18682,SECT. X.,"character and rank, but yet, like the body, soul, and spirit of a man,"
18683,SECT. X.,"they are to be referred to one origin, and they are integrants to one"
18684,SECT. X.,another.
18685,SECT. X.,
18686,SECT. X.,Just in the same manner with the parallel currents of historical
18687,SECT. X.,"events, it would appear that the early Scriptures and the Homeric"
18688,SECT. X.,poems combine to make up for us a sufficiently complete form of the
18689,SECT. X.,primitive records of our race. The Scriptures of the Old Testament give
18690,SECT. X.,"us the history of the line, in which the promise of the Messiah was"
18691,SECT. X.,handed down. But the intellectual and social developments of man are
18692,SECT. X.,"there represented in the simplest and the slightest, nay, even in the"
18693,SECT. X.,"narrowest forms. With the exception of Solomon, who, in spite of his"
18694,SECT. X.,"wisdom, was enticed away from God by lust, and of the two illustrious"
18695,SECT. X.,"specimens of uncorrupted piety in the midst of dangerous power, Joseph"
18696,SECT. X.,"and Daniel, I know not whether we can, on the authority of Holy"
18697,SECT. X.,"Scripture, point to any character of the Mosaic or Judaic history as"
18698,SECT. X.,"great in any other sense, than as the organs of that Almighty One,"
18699,SECT. X.,with whom nothing human is either great or small. It is plain that if
18700,SECT. X.,we bring the leading characters of that history into contrast with the
18701,SECT. X.,"Achilles or the Ulysses of Homer, and with his other marked personages,"
18702,SECT. X.,these latter undoubtedly give us a representation and development of
18703,SECT. X.,"human nature, and of man in his social relations, that Scripture from"
18704,SECT. X.,"its very nature could not supply. Each has its own function to perform,"
18705,SECT. X.,"so that there is no room for competition between them, and it is"
18706,SECT. X.,better to avoid comparison altogether; and to decline to consider the
18707,SECT. X.,legislation of Moses as a work to be compared either with the heroic
18708,SECT. X.,"institutions, or with systems like those of Lycurgus or of Solon. We"
18709,SECT. X.,then obtain a clear view of it as a scheme evidently constructed not
18710,SECT. X.,"alone with human but with superhuman wisdom, if only we measure it in"
18711,SECT. X.,reference to its very peculiar end. That end was not to give political
18712,SECT. X.,"lessons to mankind, which are more aptly supplied elsewhere. It was to"
18713,SECT. X.,"fence in, with the ruder materials of the ceremonial and municipal law,"
18714,SECT. X.,"a home, within which the succession of true piety and enlightened faith"
18715,SECT. X.,"might be preserved; a garden wherein the Lord God might, so to speak,"
18716,SECT. X.,"still walk as He had walked of old, and take His delight with the sons"
18717,SECT. X.,"of men. But this high calling had reference only to chosen persons,"
18718,SECT. X.,"a few among the few. Over and above this interior work, there was a"
18719,SECT. X.,national vocation also. The aim of that vocation seems to have been
18720,SECT. X.,"to isolate the people, so as to stop the influences from without that"
18721,SECT. X.,"might tend in the direction of change; and so far to crystallize, as it"
18722,SECT. X.,"were, its institutions within, that they might preserve in untainted"
18723,SECT. X.,purity the tradition and the expectation of Him that was to come.

18728,SECT. X.,"profound of all His wise designs, He removed it, for the time of its"

18734,SECT. X.,"before the tribunal of the mere literary critic, we may strain our"
18735,SECT. X.,"generosity at the cost of justice, and still only be able to accord"
18736,SECT. X.,to it a secondary place. The mistake surely is to bring it there at
18737,SECT. X.,"all, or to view its author otherwise than as the vehicle of a Divine"
18738,SECT. X.,"purpose, which uses all instruments, great, insignificant, or middling,"
18739,SECT. X.,"according to the end in view, but of which all the instruments are"
18740,SECT. X.,"perfect, by reason not of what is intrinsic to themselves, but, simply"
18741,SECT. X.,"and solely, of their exact adaptation to that end[1014]."
18742,SECT. X.,
18743,SECT. X.,[1014] To show with what jealousy believers in revelation may justly
18744,SECT. X.,"regard the mere literary handling of the Older Scriptures, I would"
18745,SECT. X.,"refer to the remarkable work of M. Ernest Renan, ‘_Études d’Histoire"
18746,SECT. X.,Religieuse_.’ This eloquent and elastic writer treats the idea of a
18747,SECT. X.,revealed religion as wholly inadmissible; highly extols the Bible as a
18748,SECT. X.,literary treasure; but denies that the general reading of the Bible is
18749,SECT. X.,"a good, except in so far as _il vaut beaucoup mieux voir le peuple lire"
18750,SECT. X.,"la Bible que ne rien lire_ (pp. 75, 385)."
18751,SECT. X.,
18752,SECT. X.,"If, however, we ought to decline to try the Judaic code by its merely"
18753,SECT. X.,"political merits, much more ought we to apply the same principle to the"
18754,SECT. X.,"sublimity of the Prophecies, and to the deep spiritual experiences of"
18755,SECT. X.,"the Psalms. In the first, we have a voice speaking from God, with the"
18756,SECT. X.,"marks that it is of God so visibly imprinted upon it, that the mind"
18757,SECT. X.,utterly refuses to place the prophetical books in the scale against any
18758,SECT. X.,production of human genius. And all that is peculiar in our conception
18759,SECT. X.,"of Isaiah, or of Jeremiah, does not tend so much to make them eminent"
18760,SECT. X.,"among men, as to separate them from men. Homer, on the other hand, is"
18761,SECT. X.,emphatically and above all things human: he sings by the spontaneous
18762,SECT. X.,and the unconscious indwelling energies of nature; whereas these are as
18763,SECT. X.,"the trumpet of unearthly sounds, and cannot, more than Balaam could,"
18764,SECT. X.,"depart from that which is breathed into them, to utter either less or"
18765,SECT. X.,more.
18766,SECT. X.,
18767,SECT. X.,But most of all does the Book of Psalms refuse the challenge of
18768,SECT. X.,"philosophical or poetical competition. In that Book, for well nigh"
18769,SECT. X.,"three thousand years, the piety of saints has found its most refined"
18770,SECT. X.,"and choicest food; to such a degree indeed, that the rank and quality"
18771,SECT. X.,"of the religious frame may in general be tested, at least negatively,"
18772,SECT. X.,by the height of its relish for them. There is the whole music of the
18773,SECT. X.,"human heart, when touched by the hand of the Maker, in all its tones"
18774,SECT. X.,"that whisper or that swell, for every hope and fear, for every joy and"
18775,SECT. X.,"pang, for every form of strength and languor, of disquietude and rest."
18776,SECT. X.,There are developed all the innermost relations of the human soul to
18777,SECT. X.,"God, built upon the platform of a covenant of love and sonship that had"
18778,SECT. X.,"its foundations in the Messiah, while in this particular and privileged"
18779,SECT. X.,Book it was permitted to anticipate His coming.

18781,SECT. X.,"We can no more then compare Isaiah and the Psalms with Homer, than"

18789,SECT. X.,
18790,SECT. X.,It appears to be to a certain extent agreed that Rome has given us the
18791,SECT. X.,"most extraordinary example among all those put upon record by history,"
18792,SECT. X.,of political organization; and has bequeathed to mankind the firmest
18793,SECT. X.,"and most durable tissue of law, the bond of social man. Greece, on the"
18794,SECT. X.,"other hand, has had for its share the development of the individual;"
18795,SECT. X.,and each has shown in its own kind the rarest specimen that has been
18796,SECT. X.,"known to the world, apart from Divine revelation. The seeds of both"
18797,SECT. X.,"these, and of all that they involved, would appear to be contained in"
18798,SECT. X.,"the Homeric poems[1015]. The condition of arts, manners, character,"
18799,SECT. X.,"and institutions, which they represent, is alike in itself entire, and"
18800,SECT. X.,without any full parallel elsewhere. It is for the bodily and mental
18801,SECT. X.,"faculties of man, that which the patriarchal and early Hebrew histories"
18802,SECT. X.,are for his spiritual life.
18803,SECT. X.,
18804,SECT. X.,[1015] In the Roman History of Mommsen is contained a masterly
18805,SECT. X.,"comparison between those two rival developments of human life, the"
18806,SECT. X.,"collective and the individual, which are represented by Rome, and by"
18807,SECT. X.,"later or historic Greece, respectively. (Mommsen Röm. Gesch. I. 2. pp."
18808,SECT. X.,18-21.) Both of them are open to criticism. In the one we may notice
18809,SECT. X.,"and brand the characteristic of an iron repression, in the other that"
18810,SECT. X.,"of a lawless freedom. But the age which ended with the war of Troy, and"
18811,SECT. X.,cast the reflection of its dying beams upon its noble but chequered
18812,SECT. X.,"epilogue in the Odyssey, appears to make no fundamental deviation"
18813,SECT. X.,"from the mean of wisdom in either direction: on the whole, it united"
18814,SECT. X.,"reverence with independence, the restraint of discipline with the"
18815,SECT. X.,"expansion of freedom: and it stood alike removed, in the plenitude of"
18816,SECT. X.,"its natural elasticity, from those extremes which in modern religion"
18817,SECT. X.,"have, on the one side, absorbed the individual, and on the other (so to"
18818,SECT. X.,speak) excommunicated him by isolation.
18819,SECT. X.,
18820,SECT. X.,"Of the personal and inward relations of man with God, of the kingdom"
18821,SECT. X.,"of grace in the world, Homer can tell us nothing: but of the kingdom"
18822,SECT. X.,"of Providence much, and of the opening powers and capabilities of"
18823,SECT. X.,"human nature, apart from divine revelation, everything. The moral law,"
18824,SECT. X.,"written on the tables of stone, was in one sense a schoolmaster to"
18825,SECT. X.,"bring us to Christ, because it demonstrated our inability to tread the"
18826,SECT. X.,way of righteousness and pardon without the Redeemer. And perhaps that
18827,SECT. X.,"ceremonial law, which indulged some things to the hardness of heart"
18828,SECT. X.,"that prevailed among the Jews, was by its permissions, as some have"
18829,SECT. X.,"construed a very remarkable passage in Ezekiel[1016], a schoolmaster in"
18830,SECT. X.,another sense; because it witnessed to the fact that they had greatly
18831,SECT. X.,"fallen below the high capacities of their nature. And again, in yet"
18832,SECT. X.,"a third sense, we may say with reverence that these primeval records"
18833,SECT. X.,"are likewise another schoolmaster, teaching us, although with another"
18834,SECT. X.,"voice, the very same lesson: because they show us the total inability"
18835,SECT. X.,"of our race, even when at its maximum of power, to solve for ourselves"
18836,SECT. X.,the problems of our destiny; to extract for ourselves the sting from
18837,SECT. X.,"care, from sorrow, and above all, from death; or even to retain without"
18838,SECT. X.,"waste the vital heat of the knowledge of God, when we have become"
18839,SECT. X.,separate from the source that imparts it.

18846,SECT. X.,"between the times preceding the Advent, and those which have followed"
18847,SECT. X.,"it. Since the Advent, Christianity has marched for fifteen hundred"
18848,SECT. X.,"years at the head of human civilization; and has driven, harnessed to"
18849,SECT. X.,"its chariot as the horses of a triumphal car, the chief intellectual"
18850,SECT. X.,and material forces of the world. Its learning has been the learning of
18851,SECT. X.,"the world, its art the art of the world, its genius the genius of the"
18852,SECT. X.,"world, its greatness, glory, grandeur, and majesty have been almost,"
18853,SECT. X.,"though not absolutely, all that in these respects the world has had to"
18854,SECT. X.,"boast of. That which is to come, I do not presume to portend: but of"
18855,SECT. X.,"the past we may speak with confidence. He who hereafter, in even the"
18856,SECT. X.,"remotest age, with the colourless impartiality of mere intelligence,"
18857,SECT. X.,may seek to know what durable results mankind has for the last fifteen
18858,SECT. X.,"hundred years achieved, what capital of the mind it has accumulated and"
18859,SECT. X.,"transmitted, will find his investigations perforce concentrated upon,"
18860,SECT. X.,"and almost confined to that part, that minor part, of mankind which has"
18861,SECT. X.,been Christian.
18862,SECT. X.,
18863,SECT. X.,"Before the Advent, it was quite otherwise. The treasure of Divine"
18864,SECT. X.,Revelation was then hidden in a napkin: it was given to a people who
18865,SECT. X.,were almost forbidden to impart it; at least of whom it was simply
18866,SECT. X.,"required, that they should preserve it without variation. They had"
18867,SECT. X.,no world-wide vocation committed to them; they lay ensconced in a
18868,SECT. X.,"country which was narrow and obscure; obscure, not only with reference"
18869,SECT. X.,"to the surpassing splendour of Greece and Rome, but in comparison with"
18870,SECT. X.,"Assyria, or Persia, or Egypt. They have not supplied the Christian"
18871,SECT. X.,"ages with laws and institutions, arts and sciences, with the chief"
18872,SECT. X.,models of greatness in genius or in character. The Providence of
18873,SECT. X.,God committed this work to others; and to Homer seems to have been
18874,SECT. X.,"intrusted the first, which was perhaps, all things considered, also the"
18875,SECT. X.,most remarkable stage of it[1017].

18880,SECT. X.,has too boldly put into the mouth of our Blessed Lord. We there find

18882,SECT. X.,"between the person of the All-wise, and the language and ideas, on"
18883,SECT. X.,"the whole not less just, which are given to Satan. In particular, I"
18884,SECT. X.,"lament the claim, really no better than a childish one, made on the"
18885,SECT. X.,"part of the Jews, to be considered as the fountainhead of the Greek"
18886,SECT. X.,"arts and letters, and the assumption for them of higher attainments in"
18887,SECT. X.,"political science. This is a sacrifice of truth, reason, and history to"
18888,SECT. X.,"prejudice, by which, as by all such proceedings, religion is sure to be"

18893,SECT. X.,Without bearing fully in mind this contrast between the providential

18895,SECT. X.,"as we ought the importance of the part assigned, before the Advent of"
18896,SECT. X.,"our Lord, to nations and persons who lived beyond the immediate and"
18897,SECT. X.,narrow pale of Divine Revelation. The relation of the old dispensation
18898,SECT. X.,"to those who were not Jews, was essentially different from that of"
18899,SECT. X.,Christendom to those who are not Christians. Only the fall of man
18900,SECT. X.,and his recovery are the universal facts with which Revelation is
18901,SECT. X.,concerned; all others are limited and partial. The interval between
18902,SECT. X.,"the occurrence of the first, and the provision for the second, was"
18903,SECT. X.,occupied by a variety of preparations in severalty for the revelation
18904,SECT. X.,"of the kingdom of God. Until the Incarnation, the world’s history was"
18905,SECT. X.,"without a centre. When the Incarnation came, it showed itself to be the"
18906,SECT. X.,"centre of all that had preceded, as well as of all that was to follow:"
18907,SECT. X.,"and since the withdrawal of the visible Messiah, the history of man has"
18908,SECT. X.,"been grouped around His Word, and around the Church in which the effect"
18909,SECT. X.,and virtue of His Incarnation are still by His unseen power prolonged.
18910,SECT. X.,
18911,SECT. X.,The picture thus offered to our view is a very remarkable one. We see
18912,SECT. X.,"the glories of the world, and that greatest marvel of God’s earthly"
18913,SECT. X.,"creation, the mind of man, become like little children, and yield"
18914,SECT. X.,themselves to be led by the hand of the Good Shepherd: but it seems as
18915,SECT. X.,"though the ancient promise of His coming, while just strong enough to"
18916,SECT. X.,"live in this wayward sphere, was not strong enough to make the conquest"
18917,SECT. X.,of it; as if nothing but His own actual manifestation in the strength
18918,SECT. X.,"of lowliness and of sorrow, and crowned by the extremity of contempt"
18919,SECT. X.,"and shame, was sufficient to restore for the world at large that symbol"
18920,SECT. X.,"of the universal duty of individual obedience and conformity, which is"
18921,SECT. X.,afforded by the establishment of the authority of the spiritual King
18922,SECT. X.,"over all the functions of our nature, and all the spheres, however"
18923,SECT. X.,"manifold and remote they may seem to be, in which they find their"
18924,SECT. X.,"exercise. Nor is this lesson the less striking because this, like other"
18925,SECT. X.,"parts of the divine dispensations, has been marred by the perversity of"
18926,SECT. X.,"man, ever striving to escape from that inward control wherein lies the"

18929,SECT. X.,"But, even after the Advent, it was not at once that the Sovereign"
18930,SECT. X.,of the new kingdom put in His claim for all the wealth that it
18931,SECT. X.,"contained. As, in the day of His humiliation, He rode into Jerusalem,"
18932,SECT. X.,"foreshadowing his royal dominion to come, so Saint Paul was forthwith"
18933,SECT. X.,consecrated to God as a kind of first fruits of the learning and
18934,SECT. X.,"intellect of man. Yet for many generations after Christ, it was still"
18935,SECT. X.,the Supreme will to lay in human weakness the foundations of divine
18936,SECT. X.,"strength. Not the Apostles only, but the martyrs, and not the martyrs"
18937,SECT. X.,"only, but the first fathers and doctors of the Church, were men of whom"
18938,SECT. X.,none could suspect that they drew the weapons of their warfare from the
18939,SECT. X.,"armouries of human cultivation: nor of them could it be said, that by"
18940,SECT. X.,virtue of their human endowments they had achieved the triumphs of the
18941,SECT. X.,"cross; as it might perhaps have been said, had they brought to their"
18942,SECT. X.,"work the immense popular powers of St. Chrysostom, or the masculine"
18943,SECT. X.,"energy of St. Athanasius, or the varied and comprehensive genius of St."
18944,SECT. X.,Augustine.

18946,SECT. X.,"Nor, again, if we are right in the belief that we are not to look"
18947,SECT. X.,for the early development of humanity in the pages of Jewish and
18948,SECT. X.,"patriarchal history, but rather to believe that it was given to"
18949,SECT. X.,"another people, and the office of recording it to the father, not only"
18950,SECT. X.,"of poetry, but of letters, does it seem difficult to read in this"
18951,SECT. X.,"arrangement the purpose of the Most High, and herewith the wisdom of"
18952,SECT. X.,"that purpose. Had the Scriptures been preserved, had the Messiah been"
18953,SECT. X.,"Incarnate, among a people who were in political sagacity, in martial"
18954,SECT. X.,"energy, in soaring and diving intellect, in vivid imagination, in the"
18955,SECT. X.,"graces of art and civilized life, the flower of their time, then the"
18956,SECT. X.,divine origin of Christianity would have stood far less clear and
18957,SECT. X.,"disembarrassed than it now does. The eagle that mounted upon high,"
18958,SECT. X.,"bearing on his wings the Everlasting Gospel, would have made his first"
18959,SECT. X.,"spring from a great eminence, erected by the wit and skill of man;"
18960,SECT. X.,"and the elevation of that eminence, measured upward from the plain"
18961,SECT. X.,"of common humanity, would have been so much to be deducted from the"
18962,SECT. X.,triumph of the Redeemer.

18968,SECT. X.,"been previously achieved in the march of human advancement, would have"
18969,SECT. X.,been clothed in a plausibility which they must now for ever want. ‘God
18970,SECT. X.,hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and
18971,SECT. X.,God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things
18972,SECT. X.,"which are mighty; and base things of the world, and things which are"
