33,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
34,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"The ""Nibelungenlied,"" as the great national epic of Germany, is not only"
35,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,one of the most important literary monuments that the German mind has
36,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"produced in all periods of its history, but, in reality beyond this, it"
37,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,is also in its matter and its manner one of the world's great classics.
38,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,It is this inherently because of the universal intelligibility of its
39,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"story, for the broad human sympathy which must be felt with its"
40,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"characters and their motives of action, and for the sustained poetic"
41,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,treatment of the whole in the long poem. In all these respects the
42,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"""Nibelungenlied,"" although German in its spirit and its environment,"
43,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"rises inevitably above the confines of nationality, and becomes, like"
44,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"other works that are in a true sense great, by virtue of its"
45,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,universality an integral part of that cosmopolitan body that we call the
46,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,literature of the world.
47,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
48,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Like the ""Iliad,"" or any other popular epic whatever, the"
49,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"""Nibelungenlied"" is, however, first and foremost a picture of the"
50,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"national life and the national soul. Its characters in this way are,"
51,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"consequently, both fundamentally and of necessity a part of their own"
52,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"special environment into which each, according to his individuality,"
53,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"fits; and the manners and customs, the religion and ethics, are first of"
54,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,all essentially German in order to embody them and to motive their
55,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,actions to the public for which the poem was originally intended. What
56,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"we are given in the ""Nibelungenlied"" is primarily then, at least in its"
57,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"exterior, a picture of German life in the twelfth and thirteenth"
58,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,centuries. The customs are those of the courts and castles of the place
59,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"and time, the men and women are the knights and ladies who inhabit them;"
60,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,and if the real mainsprings of motive and action sometimes go back
61,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,beyond the poet's own day and generation for reasons that shall
62,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"presently be told, the thoughts and feelings of the characters under his"
63,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,hand betray on the surface no trace of it.
64,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
65,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,To an English reader there is astonishingly little in the
66,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"""Nibelungenlied"" in motive that is unintelligible or hopelessly remote."
67,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"It is not that its manners of thought are our manners of thought, or its"
68,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"ethics our ethics. Its deeds, since the real story is an ancient"
69,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"inheritance, are tragic with battle, murder, and sudden death; but, in"
70,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"spite of all this, there is in us an innate appreciation of it and of"
71,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,its spirit that it is utterly impossible to feel in much literature that
72,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"is not our own. This of course arises from the fact that it is, in a"
73,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"sense, our own, as, in part, at the beginning in very truth it was. The"
74,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"difference in its whole environment from us is still, in reality, not"
75,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"great, and we realize, consciously or unconsciously, that it is in many"
76,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,ways our own ancient past that is chronicled in the German poem.
77,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
78,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"For all these reasons it comes readily about that, in the light of the"
79,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"poet's master touch, the characters of the ""Nibelungenlied"" that he has"
80,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,left in such actuality in his verses are to us neither vague nor
81,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"shadowy, but are real persons who live and act before us. This is in"
82,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"fact truer of the ""Nibelungenlied"" than of almost any other great poem"
83,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"of the kind, whatever its time and place of origin. Siegfried and"
84,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Kriemhild, Hagen and Rudeger are not the mere creations and"
85,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,impersonations of a poet's imagination; they are to us real men and
86,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,women who lived their lives and died their deaths as the poet has
87,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,described them. That he has told his tale with wonderful literary skill
88,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,as a whole and at times with marvellous appreciation of the value of the
89,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"moment, is also to be stated. Because no doubt in part from the way in"
90,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"which the poem has come down to us, there is at times superfluous"
91,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"material that had better been left away, but in this fact, too, the poem"
92,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,differs but little from other popular epics.
93,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
94,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"As a whole, the ""Nibelungenlied"" is characterized by a literary unity of"
95,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"treatment by no means inconsiderable, and greater, in point of fact,"
96,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"than its origin would ordinarily promise. Its unity, however, is"
97,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"dramatic, rather than epic in the ordinary sense. This character it"
98,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"never loses throughout the whole long action. Deed follows deed, stroke"
99,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"upon stroke, until the final catastrophe is inevitably reached and the"
100,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,story is ended.
101,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
102,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"That this story in its origin is not narrowly German, but is Germanic"
103,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"property, should be borne in mind by its reader, since many of its"
104,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"episodes acquire thereby a broader significance, and the whole poem"
105,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,assumes a wider interest.
106,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
107,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"The earliest versions of the story of the Volsungs and Nibelungs, the"
108,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Germanic ""tale of Troy,"" that have come down to us are not from German"
109,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"territory, but from the Scandinavian North, although here, too, the"
110,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,scene of the principal action is on the Rhine and in the land of the
111,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Huns, which is vaguely conceived to be a part of the German country."
112,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Sigmund, the father of Sigurd, is a King in the land of the Franks;"
113,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Sigurd is slain to the south of the Rhine, and in the Rhine is forever"
114,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,hidden the fateful hoard of the Nibelungs. The story in reality wandered
115,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,out twice into the North from its original home in Germany: once
116,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,apparently in the Viking age when the Northmen for the first time
117,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,came into close contact with the other Germanic people on the
118,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"continent and in the British Islands, a period long antecedent to the"
119,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"""Nibelungenlied;"" and again five hundred years later, after the German"
120,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"poem had arisen, since it can be readily shown that this has been used"
121,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,as a source of a part of the material.
122,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
123,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,The very first of these Northern versions is that contained in the
124,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"""Elder Edda,"" a collection of mythological and legendary poems in the"
125,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Old Norse language, of unknown authorship, whose time and place of"
126,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,origin are alike matters of varying supposition. The subject was the
127,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,theme of poets for centuries in the North. The oldest of the poems in
128,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"the ""Edda"" that has to do with the story of the ""Nibelungenlied,"" from"
129,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"internal evidence, was made as early as the year 900; the latest is from"
130,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"a time not far from 1200. These poems and fragments of poems, some of"
131,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,them even in prose rescript and most of them interspersed here and there
132,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"with bits of prose, do not make in any sense a connected story. Their"
133,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,unknown collector arranged them as well as might be in connected
134,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"sequence, but even then their action is not consecutive; they overlap"
135,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"each other, parts of the story are told and retold and not seldom with"
136,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"an inconsistency of detail. There is, accordingly, in the ""Elder Edda"""
137,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,no thought of an epic either in matter or manner. There is the material
138,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"for an epic in the rough, but without an idea in the mind of any poet of"
139,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,the time of actual epical treatment.
140,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
141,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,The story as contained in the Old Norse poems is by no means identical
142,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"with the ""Nibelungenlied."" First and foremost, it is infinitely older in"
143,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"its whole conception, and much more nearly approaches original"
144,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,conditions as they existed in the mode of thought and in the manner of
145,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"living of the early Germanic people. It is a story, here, of the days"
146,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,when the world was young; when the gods still walked the earth and mixed
147,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,themselves in with human affairs in which they had an active interest;
148,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,when motives were clearer and action was more direct; when human
149,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"passions burned even fiercer than in the ""Nibelungenlied,"" and love and"
150,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,hate together knew no boundaries until they had worked themselves out in
151,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"the utter destruction of their object. Of the first of these conditions,"
152,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"the ""Nibelungenlied"" in its character of an epic of the Middle Ages has"
153,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,not kept a trace. In the Eddic poems it is the ring cursed by the gods
154,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,to all its possessors that motives the entire action; that leads with
155,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"the certainty of fate to the death of Sigurd, the Siegfried of the"
156,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"""Edda,"" to all the woes that follow, and to the ultimate utter"
157,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,destruction of the entire race of the Nibelungs.
158,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
159,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"As most critics have pointed out, the fundamental difference in the"
160,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,treatment of the story consists in the fact that the principal epic
161,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"interest in the Eddic poems is the relation of Sigurd to Brynhild, the"
162,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Valkyrie, who is here a heroic figure, who rises immeasurably not only"
163,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"above the other women of the tale, but above most of the other"
164,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"characters in importance of personality. In the ""Nibelungenlied"" it is"
165,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Kriemhild, Gudrun in the ""Edda,"" and Hagen who are the principal figures"
166,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"in the action. In the Northern version, Gudrun does not avenge herself"
167,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"upon her brothers as does Kriemhild in the ""Nibelungenlied,"" but Atli,"
168,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"her husband after Sigurd, slays them, and Gudrun then takes vengeance"
169,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"upon him. In the ""Edda,"" too, other saga cycles are brought into"
170,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"connection with this, viz., the Northern legend of Helgi, at the"
171,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"beginning, and the Gothic legend of Ermanrich, at the end."
172,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
173,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,The Eddic poems are not the only versions in Old Norse literature. An
174,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"epitome of the story based upon the poems is contained in the ""Snorra"
175,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Edda,"" a work written by the Icelander Snorri Sturluson, who lived from"
176,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"1178 to 1241, to serve as a handbook for poets and which contains in"
177,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,this way the myths and legends of the North.
178,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
179,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Next to the Eddic songs the most important of the Northern versions,"
180,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"however, is the long ""Völsunga Saga"" from the second half of the"
181,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"thirteenth century, which, again, is based upon the Eddic poems and upon"
182,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,others in addition that have now been lost. Like most of the Old Norse
183,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"sagas, it is prose with the occasional inclusion of verse cited to"
184,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,justify or to embellish its statements. It gives with extraordinary
185,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,wealth of detail the whole old story in connected form and desires to be
186,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"called, as it has been called, a prose epic. William Morris, in his"
187,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"superb translation, has deservedly characterized it as ""the most"
188,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"complete and dramatic form of the Great Epic of the North."" The story is"
189,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"further contained, in some of its details only, in the strange tale of"
190,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"""Nornagest,"" which has again made use of the Eddic songs and quotes one"
191,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,of them entire.
192,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
193,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,The Old Norse story is so important for its bearing on the
194,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"intelligibility of the ""Nibelungenlied"" that it is absolutely necessary"
195,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,to take it actively into consideration in any discussion of the German
196,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"poem. The epitome contained in the ""Snorra Edda,"" since it gives the"
197,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"whole story from beginning to end in a form as short as may be, is here"
198,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,given in its entirety:
199,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
200,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"""Three gods, Odin, Hoenir, and Loki, once went out to explore the"
201,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"whole world. They came to a certain river, and went along the river to a"
202,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"waterfall, and at the waterfall there was an otter that had taken a"
203,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"salmon out of the fall and ate it, half asleep. Then Loki took up a"
204,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,stone and cast it at the otter and struck him in the head. Loki
205,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,thereupon boasted of his catch that he had got at a blow both the otter
206,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,and the salmon. They took the salmon and the otter and carried them
207,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"along with them until they came to a farmstead, where they went in. The"
208,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,head of the household that dwelt there was named Hreidmar; he was a
209,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,mighty man and much skilled in magic. He invited the gods to lodge there
210,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"for the night, and they told him that they had with them provisions in"
211,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,plenty and showed him their booty. But when Hreidmar saw the otter he
212,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"called his sons Fafnir and Regin and said that Otter, their brother, had"
213,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"been killed, and told them who had done it. Thereupon, the father and"
214,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"his sons fell upon the gods and took them and bound them, saying that"
215,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,the otter was the son of Hreidmar. The gods offered as a ransom as much
216,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"money as Hreidmar himself should determine, and that was agreed upon as"
217,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,a reconciliation and was bound with oaths.
218,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
219,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"""Then the otter was flayed, and Hreidmar took the otter's skin and said"
220,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,that they should fill it with red gold and should then cover it wholly
221,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"up with gold, and that should be their atonement. Odin then sent Loki"
222,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,into the land of the black elves and he came to the dwarf who is called
223,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Andvari; he was a fish in the water, and Loki took him and laid upon him"
224,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,as a ransom all the gold that he had in his stone. And when they came
225,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"into the stone where he dwelt, the dwarf brought out all the gold that"
226,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,he owned and that was a very great treasure. Then the dwarf slipped
227,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"under his hand a little gold ring. That Loki, however, saw and bade him"
228,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"produce the ring. The dwarf begged him not to take the ring from him,"
229,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,and said that he could breed treasure out of it if he kept it. Loki told
230,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"him that he should not keep back a penny, and took the ring from him and"
231,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,went out. The dwarf said that the ring should be the death of everyone
232,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"who owned it. Loki replied that that suited him well, and that the"
233,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"condition should be held good, since he would bring it to the ears of"
234,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,them who might get possession of it. He then went away to Hreidmar's and
235,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"showed Odin the gold; but when he saw the ring, it seemed to him very"
236,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"beautiful and he took it out of the treasure, but paid over to Hreidmar"
237,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,the gold.
238,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
239,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"""Then Hreidmar filled the otter's skin as full as he could and set it up"
240,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,on its feet when it was full; Odin then went up to cover the skin with
241,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,gold and said to Hreidmar that he should see whether the skin were
242,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,wholly covered. Hreidmar looked at it and considered it carefully and
243,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"saw a whisker, and bade him cover that, also, or else their atonement"
244,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,were at an end. Then Odin brought out the ring and covered the whisker
245,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"and said that they now were freed from the otter ransom. When, however,"
246,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Odin had taken his spear and Loki his shoes, and they needed no longer"
247,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"to fear, then said Loki that what Andvari had spoken, that the ring"
248,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"should be the death of him who owned it, should hold good, and it did"
249,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,hold good thereafter.
250,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
251,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"""Hreidmar took the gold as ransom for his son, but Fafnir and Regin"
252,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"demanded some of it as a ransom for their brother. Hreidmar, however,"
253,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,would not grant them a single penny of the gold. That was the
254,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,ill-advised deed of the brothers that they killed their father for the
255,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,gold. Then Regin demanded that Fafnir divide the gold in halves between
256,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,them. Fafnir replied that there was little chance that he would share
257,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,the gold with his brother when he had killed his father for the sake of
258,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"it, and bade Regin to begone or he would fare as had Hreidmar. Fafnir"
259,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"had then taken the helmet which Hreidmar had owned, which was called the"
260,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Helmet of Awe and which all living things feared that saw it, and set it"
261,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"upon his head, and he took the sword which is called Hrotti. Regin had"
262,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,the sword that is called Refil and he fled away; but Fafnir went up upon
263,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"the Glittering Heath and made him there a lair, and he took upon himself"
264,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,the shape of a serpent and lay upon the gold.
265,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
266,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"""Regin then went to King Hjalprek, at Thy, in Denmark, and there set up"
267,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"a smithy, and he took to foster Sigurd, the son of Sigmund (the son of"
268,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Volsung) and of Hjordis, the daughter of Eylimi. Sigurd was the most"
269,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,glorious of all war kings in lineage and strength. Regin told him where
270,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Fafnir lay upon the gold, and egged him on to seek it. Then Regin made"
271,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"the sword that is called Gram, which was so sharp that Sigurd thrust it"
272,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,in the water and it cut asunder a lock of wool that drove before the
273,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"current against the edge of the sword. Afterward, Sigurd clove in two"
274,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Regin's anvil down to the stock with the sword. After that, Sigurd and"
275,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,Regin went out upon the Glittering Heath. Then Sigurd dug a pit in
276,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,Fafnir's path and got into it; and when Fafnir crept to the water and
277,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"came over the pit, then Sigurd thrust the sword up against him and that"
278,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,was his death. Regin then came up and said that Sigurd had killed his
279,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,brother and offered him as a reconciliation that he should take the
280,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,heart of Fafnir and roast it at the fire; but Regin himself got down and
281,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,drank the blood of Fafnir and then lay down to sleep. And when Sigurd
282,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"had roasted the heart and thought that it must be done, he touched it"
283,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,with his finger to see how hard it was. And when the juice ran out of
284,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"the heart upon his finger, he burnt himself and thrust his finger into"
285,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"his mouth. And when the heart's blood came upon his tongue, then he knew"
286,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,the speech of birds and understood what the nuthatches said that sat in
287,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,the tree above him.
288,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
289,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"""Then said one:"
290,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
291,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,'There sits Sigurd
292,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"blood besprinkled,"
293,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,the heart of Fafnir
294,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,at the fire roasting;
295,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,wise methinks were
296,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"the ring despoiler,"
297,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,if he the gleaming
298,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,heart were eating.'
299,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
300,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"""Then said the other:"
301,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
302,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,'There lies Regin
303,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,with himself communing;
304,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,he will beguile the youth
305,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,who is trusting in him;
306,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,in rage he brings now
307,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,ill words together;
308,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,the evil-worker will
309,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,avenge his brother.'
310,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
311,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"""Then Sigurd went up to Regin and killed him, and took his horse, which"
312,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"was named Grani, and rode until he came to the lair of Fafnir. There he"
313,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"took the gold and bound it up in packs and laid it on the back of Grani,"
314,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,and then mounted and rode on his way. Sigurd rode until he found a house
315,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,upon the fell. Within it slept a woman who had on a helmet and a coat of
316,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,mail. He drew his sword and cut her coat of mail off her. Then she awoke
317,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,and named herself Hild. She is called Brynhild and was a Valkyrie.
318,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,Sigurd rode thence and came to the King who is named Gjuki; his wife is
319,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"named Grimhild; their children were Gunnar, Högni, Gudrun, Gudny;"
320,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,Gotthorm was a step-son of Gjuki. There Sigurd dwelt for a long time;
321,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"and he took to wife Gudrun, the daughter of Gjuki, and Gunnar and Högni"
322,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"swore with him oaths of brotherhood. Afterward, Sigurd and the sons of"
323,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Gjuki went to Atli, the son of Budli, to ask as a wife for Gunnar"
324,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Brynhild, his sister. She dwelt upon Hind Fell, and about her hall was a"
325,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"flaming fire, and she had made a vow to have as a husband that man,"
326,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"only, who dared to ride through the flame."
327,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
328,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"""Then Sigurd and the Gjukings (who are also called Niflungs) rode up"
329,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"upon the fell, and Gunnar was minded to ride through the flame. He had"
330,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"the horse that was named Goti, but the horse did not dare to leap into"
331,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,the fire. Then Sigurd and Gunnar changed their shapes and also their
332,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"names, since Grani would not go under any man except Sigurd. Then Sigurd"
333,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,leaped upon Grani and rode through the flaming fire. That night he held
334,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"a wedding with Brynhild, and when they came to bed he drew the sword"
335,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Gram out of its scabbard and laid it between them. And in the morning,"
336,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"when he awoke and dressed himself, then he gave Brynhild as a bridal"
337,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"gift the gold ring which he had taken on the Glittering Heath, and Loki"
338,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"had taken from Andvari, and he took from her another ring as a"
339,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,remembrance. Sigurd then leaped upon his horse and rode to his
340,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,companions; Gunnar and he again changed their shapes and they went back
341,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,to Gjuki with Brynhild. Sigurd had two children with Gudrun: Sigmund and
342,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,Swanhild.
343,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
344,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"""It was once upon a time that Brynhild and Gudrun went to the water to"
345,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"bleach their hair. When they came to the river, Brynhild waded out into"
346,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,the water away from the land and said that she would not have on her
347,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"head the water that ran out of Gudrun's hair, since she had the more"
348,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,noble husband. Then Gudrun went out into the river after Brynhild and
349,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"said that she should wash her hair in the river above, because she had"
350,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"the husband who was braver than anyone else in the world, since he slew"
351,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,Fafnir and Regin and gained the inheritance of them both. Then Brynhild
352,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,replied: 'It was of still greater renown that Gunnar rode the flaming
353,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,fire and Sigurd dared not.' Then Gudrun laughed and said: 'Do you think
354,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,that Gunnar rode through the flaming fire? Him I deem to have gone to
355,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"bed with you, who gave me this gold ring. But the ring that you have on"
356,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"your hand, and that you received as a bridal gift, that is called the"
357,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Ring of Andvari, and I deem that it was not Gunnar who sought it on the"
358,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,Glittering Heath.' Then Brynhild was silent and went home. After that
359,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"she egged on Gunnar and Högni to kill Sigurd, but because they had sworn"
360,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"oaths with him they egged on Gotthorm, their brother, to kill him."
361,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Gotthorm laid sword on him while he slept, and when he felt the wound he"
362,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,hurled the sword Gram after his slayer so that it cut the man asunder.
363,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Then Sigurd fell and his three-year old son, who was named Sigmund, whom"
364,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"they killed. After that, Brynhild turned sword upon herself and she was"
365,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,burned with Sigurd. And Gunnar and Högni took the treasure of Fafnir and
366,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,the Ring of Andvari and ruled all the land.
367,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
368,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"""King Atli, the son of Budli, the brother of Brynhild, then took to wife"
369,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Gudrun, whom Sigurd had had, and they had children together. King Atli"
370,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"bade Gunnar and Högni to visit him, and they went at his invitation, but"
371,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"before they went away from home they hid the gold, the Treasure of"
372,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Andvari, in the river Rhine, and it has never since been found. And King"
373,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,Atli had assembled a great force and fought with Gunnar and Högni and
374,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,they were taken prisoners. And Atli had the heart cut out of Högni while
375,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"he lived, and that was his death. Gunnar he caused to be cast into a"
376,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"serpent pit, and a harp was brought to him secretly and he struck it"
377,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"with his toes, since his hands were bound, so that all the serpents"
378,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"slept except one adder, which sprang at him, and struck in through his"
379,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,breast so that she thrust in her head and hung upon his liver until he
380,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"died. Gunnar and Högni are called Niflungs and Gjukungs, and for this"
381,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"reason the gold is called the Treasure of the Niflungs, or their"
382,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"inheritance. A little while after, Gudrun killed her two sons, and with"
383,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,gold and silver had beakers made out of their skulls and then was
384,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,celebrated the funeral feast of the Niflungs.
385,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
386,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"""At this banquet Gudrun had King Atli served with mead from the beakers,"
387,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"and there was mixed with it the blood of the boys, and their hearts she"
388,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,caused to be roasted and brought to the King to eat. And when that was
389,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,done she told him these things herself with many ugly words. There was
390,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"no lack there of intoxicating mead, so that most people slept where they"
391,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"sat. And in the night she went to the King where he was sleeping, and"
392,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"with her the son of Högni, and they fell upon him, and that was his"
393,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,death. Then they hurled fire into the hall and the people were burned
394,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,that were within. After that she went to the sea and leaped in and
395,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"wished to destroy herself, but she drifted over the fjord and came to"
396,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"the land of King Jonakr. And when he saw her, he took her to him and"
397,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"wedded her. They had three sons, who were called Sörli, Hamdir, and Erp;"
398,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"they were all as black as ravens in the color of their hair, like Gunnar"
399,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,and Högni and the other Niflungs.
400,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
401,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"""There grew up Swanhild, the daughter of Sigurd; she was the most"
402,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,beautiful of all women. That Jörmunrek the Mighty learned and sent his
403,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"son Randver to ask her hand. And when he came to Jonakr, Swanhild was"
404,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,given over to him that he might bring her to Jörmunrek. Then said Bikki
405,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"that it had fallen out better if Randver had Swanhild, since he was"
406,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"young, as were they both, and Jörmunrek was old. This counsel pleased"
407,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,the young people well; and thereupon Bikki told it to the King. Then
408,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Jörmunrek had his son taken and brought to the gallows, but Randver took"
409,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,his falcon and plucked off the feathers and bade that it be sent to his
410,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"father; then he was hanged. But when King Jörmunrek saw the falcon, it"
411,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,came into his mind that just as the falcon was incapable of flight and
412,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"featherless, so was also his kingdom disabled, since he was old and"
413,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,without a son.
414,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
415,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"""It was once upon a time when King Jörmunrek rode out of the forest from"
416,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,hunting with his men that Swanhild the Queen sat bleaching her hair.
417,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,Then they rode upon her and trod her to death under the horses' hoofs.
418,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"And when Gudrun learned this, she egged on her sons to avenge Swanhild."
419,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"And when they made ready for the journey, she got them mail, and helmets"
420,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,so strong that iron would not take hold upon it. She said the plan for
421,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,them to follow was that when they came to King Jörmunrek they should
422,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,fall upon him at night while he slept; Sörli and Hamdir should then hew
423,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"off his hands and feet, and Erp his head. When, however, they came on"
424,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"the way, they asked Erp what assistance they might have of him if they"
425,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,met King Jörmunrek. He replied that he would give them such aid as the
426,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,hand gave the foot. They replied that naught at all did the foot depend
427,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,upon the hand. They were so angry at their mother that she had led them
428,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"out with words of hatred, that they desired to do that which should be"
429,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"the worst thing of all to her and they killed Erp, since she loved him"
430,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"most. A little while after, as Sörli walked along he slipped with both"
431,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"feet, but held himself up with his hand. Then he said: 'The hand does"
432,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,now help the foot; better it were that Erp were alive!' And when they
433,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"came to King Jörmunrek's at night, and went in where he slept and hewed"
434,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"off his hands and feet, he awoke and called upon his men and bade them"
435,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"awaken. Then said Hamdir: 'Off were now his head, if Erp were alive!'"
436,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Then the men-at-arms arose and attacked them, but could not overcome"
437,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,them with weapons. Jörmunrek then called out that stones should be
438,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"hurled at them, and this was done. Then Sörli and Hamdir fell, and then"
439,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"were dead all the race and descendants of the Gjukings."""
440,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
441,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"The Eddic poems and the ""Völsunga Saga"" give us even much more fully in"
442,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,detail than does this epitome the deeds of Sigurd's youth of which the
443,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"""Nibelungenlied"" knows so little. The latter, too, has forgotten the"
444,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"early relationship of Sigurd to Brynhild and her whole early history,"
445,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,although her superhuman character is still remembered and obscure
446,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,reference is made to their previous acquaintance. There is no longer a
447,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"reason why Siegfried and Brunhild should die together, as in the ""Edda."""
448,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,That the ultimate catastrophe falls out differently in the two versions
449,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,of the story is due to this very fact of the loss of original detail. In
450,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,that her brothers who had murdered Sigurd live in triumph afterward and
451,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"no true reconciliation can be possible between them, Kriemhild must of"
452,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"necessity avenge herself upon them, instead of upon Atli, as in the"
453,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"earlier form of the story. And, as has already been remarked, the real"
454,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"significance to the action of the fateful ""Ring of the Nibelungs"" and"
455,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,the accursed hoard has wholly vanished to give place to reasons that
456,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,have much more affinity with human motives of conduct.
457,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
458,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"The ""Nibelungenlied,"" like the Northern poems before it, is legendary,"
459,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,with only here and there a historical fact as a nucleus about which has
460,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,gathered in the course of the centuries material for many times and
461,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"places. The destruction of the Burgundians, under their King Gunther, by"
462,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"the Huns, which occurred in the year 437, has undoubtedly furnished the"
463,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"ultimate catastrophe. It is not known, however, that Attila, the Atli of"
464,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"the ""Edda"" and the Etzel of the ""Nibelungenlied,"" was the leader of the"
465,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Huns on this occasion, although the event did take place during his"
466,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,lifetime. Attila's brother Bleda appears in the poem as Bloedelin.
467,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Giselher, the brother of Gunther, is also mentioned in the old"
468,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Burgundian law-code, the _Lex Burgundionum_. Of Siegfried and Brunhild"
469,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"history knows no trace, although an attempt has been made to connect the"
470,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,one with Arminius and the other with Brünehild of Austrasia. The
471,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"appearance in the poem of Dietrich of Bern, Theodoric the Great, the"
472,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Ostrogothic conqueror of Italy, who lived from 475 to 526, is an example"
473,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,of the absorption of material from another cycle into the original
474,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"legend, material which, in its turn, clusters about a historical"
475,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"character. The Bishop Pilgrin, of Passau, represented in the poem as the"
476,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"uncle of the Burgundian kings and of Kriemhild, has a historical"
477,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,prototype in an actual Pilgrin who held the see of Passau from 971 to
478,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"991 and has, it may be, been here introduced by the poet to honor him."
479,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"As for the rest, facts that may have been ultimately historical have"
480,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"been freely used by the poet of the ""Nibelungenlied"" and his"
481,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,predecessors until it is no longer possible to tell where legend begins
482,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,and history ends.
483,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
484,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"That Siegfried and Brunhild are at the end mythical, rather than at all"
485,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"historical, has been surmised, rather than proved. It has been"
486,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"attempted, in point of fact, to show that the whole story has arisen in"
487,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,its earliest form through a union of an old myth of Siegfried with the
488,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,historical materials that have been indicated and others whose real
489,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,significance has subsequently been obliterated and lost. The believers
490,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,of this theory have pointed to the thoroughly mythical character of the
491,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"version of the story in the ""Edda"" and particularly of its earliest part"
492,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"as plausible evidence, and they would see in the whole the union of a"
493,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Frankish myth of Siegfried, originally independent, with a Burgundian"
494,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"historical narrative. Siegfried and Brunhild, in this way, have been"
495,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"thought to embody, at the beginning, the nature-myth of the awakening"
496,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,earth-goddess from the sleep of winter at the reanimating touch of
497,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,summer. Lachmann makes the fundamental fact at the outset a myth of the
498,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"death of Balder, and Wilhelm Müller a myth of Freyr, both light-gods of"
499,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"the old mythology. It is, nevertheless, impossible to follow the"
500,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"upholders of these theories into the details of their interpretation,"
501,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,and the whole main assumption of a mythical origin is a matter of
502,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"doubt. That Siegfried and Brunhild, however, have mythical"
503,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,characteristics that they have retained after all memory of the ancient
504,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"mythology as such has been absolutely forgotten, no reader of the story"
505,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"can deny, and in this respect the ""Nibelungenlied"" is no different from"
506,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,the legendary literature of all the nations of the world.
507,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
508,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Early German poems on the story of the Nibelungs, although it is"
509,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"altogether likely that they once existed, have not been preserved. The"
510,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"""Nibelungenlied"" itself it is not possible to follow back of the twelfth"
511,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"century, by the middle of which it seems to have already had the form in"
512,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"which it has come down to us. The internal evidence of metre, rhyme, and"
513,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"language shows, too, beyond a doubt, that it could not have arisen at a"
514,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,much earlier time.
515,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
516,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,The author of the poem is unknown. The most plausible hypothesis as to
517,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"his actual personality makes him an Austrian knight of about 1140,"
518,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"possibly a member of the Kürenberg family, who lived in the neighborhood"
519,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"of Linz, on the Danube. A Kürenberg of the twelfth century is the oldest"
520,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,court poet who used in his lyrics the same strophic form that is
521,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"characteristic of the ""Nibelungenlied,"" but that the two poets are"
522,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"identical is by no manner of means a certainty. In the same way, the"
523,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,place of origin of the poem is a matter of supposition. In all
524,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"probability, however, it arose in southeastern German territory in"
525,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Austria. Although the poet knows the region on the Rhine about Worms, he"
526,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,has an infinitely wider acquaintance with Austrian localities of which
527,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"he makes specific mention. It was in Austria, too, at this time that the"
528,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"beginnings arose of the court lyric poetry, that Minnesangs Frühling, as"
529,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"the Germans strikingly characterize the period, that presently blossomed"
530,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,out into one of the fullest expressions in all its history of German
531,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,life and thought.
532,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
533,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Bartsch, in the introduction to his edition of the ""Nibelungenlied,"" has"
534,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"most admirably summarized this whole matter. According to him, it was an"
535,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Austrian poet who, before the middle of the twelfth century, united"
536,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"songs sung at his time and oral tradition, known to him as well as to"
537,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"everybody else, into a single whole. How far folk-song and tradition had"
538,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"anticipated him in this is no longer to be ascertained, but it may be"
539,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,inferred from the Northern form of the legend that it had long since
540,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"taken place. It remained to him, however, to arrange the whole in its"
541,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"details of sequence of action, to fill out the gaps left by popular song"
542,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"and story, and to give it the impress of his own day, which it so"
543,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,unmistakably bears. That this is not in accord with other ideas of
544,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"authorship and origin must nevertheless be stated. Karl Lachmann, one of"
545,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"the most astute, if not one of the most mistaken, critics of the poem,"
546,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"taking Wolf's Prolegomena to Homer for his model, set up the theory that"
547,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,has since played an important part in the discussion of the genesis of
548,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"the ""Nibelungenlied."""
549,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
550,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"According to the Lachmann theory, the poem consists of no less than"
551,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"twenty distinct lays, each differing inherently from the rest, and each,"
552,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"with the exception of the Eighth and Ninth, by different authors. To"
553,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"arrive at this result, more than a third of the entire number of stanzas"
554,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"has, for one reason or another, been rejected as not genuine. As Lettsom"
555,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"has cleverly put it in the original preface to his translation, where"
556,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"this whole matter is presented with some detail: ""He [Lachmann] has in"
557,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,fact put every stanza and every verse on its trial. Some have been
558,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"condemned by him to italics, as interpolations; others to brackets, as"
559,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"continuations by different hands; others again, which he supposes to be"
560,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"the latest additions, so far from being pitied for their youth, have"
561,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"been visited with both kinds of punishment. He has not, however,"
562,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"sentenced any of the delinquents to transportation from the text; or,"
563,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"perhaps it would be more correct to say that he has sentenced them, but"
564,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,has not carried the sentence into execution. The result of the whole
565,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"assize has been that out of the 2,316 stanzas 1,437 have been honorably"
566,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"acquitted; the rest have been italicised, bracketed, or both.... The"
567,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"twenty lays,"" he continues, ""which had already suffered from the"
568,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"interpolations and corruptions incident to oral tradition, were first"
569,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"collected, committed to writing, and patched together into one poem"
570,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"about the year 1210 by some unknown compiler, whose handiwork was"
571,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,afterward corrected or depraved by two separate but equally unknown
572,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,revisers. It is his opinion that scarcely a stanza of what we possess is
573,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"older than 1190, while even the latest additions are not more recent"
574,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"than 1225. The whole poem, therefore, is, according to Professor"
575,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Lachmann, the work of contemporary authors, whether we call their"
576,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,compositions spurious or genuine; and the task undertaken is neither
577,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,more nor less than to distribute a mass of unowned literary property
578,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"among nineteen or twenty poets and an indefinite number of poetasters,"
579,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"of whom nothing, not even their existence, is known except by"
580,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"conjecture, and of whose distinguishing characteristics we are of course"
581,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"completely ignorant, except as far as we may guess at them from the"
582,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"internal evidence, real or imagined, of the poem itself."""
583,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
584,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,Lachmann's theory of separate authorship of portions of the poem has not
585,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,maintained itself against the critics. That there are contradictions in
586,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"its statements and different values in its parts cannot be denied, but"
587,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,they are not explained on the grounds here set forth. The attempted
588,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,restoration of the poem by elimination and rearrangement has not left
589,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,twenty or any number of lays that have actually the air of being
590,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"separate poems. ""It is just here,"" continues Lettsom, ""that the failure"
591,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,of the hypothesis is most conspicuous.... Some of the lays are not
592,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"ill-adapted, from the nature of their contents, to form separate poems,"
593,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"but they are by no means out of place as episodes in a long work, and"
594,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"are, besides, connected with the rest, while the latter, from the"
595,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"insignificance of their contents alone, from their reference to one"
596,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"another, from their allusions to the past and anticipations of the"
597,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"future, from their abrupt commencements and still more abrupt"
598,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"conclusions, and from their general fragmentary nature, could never have"
599,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,been independent lays.... The dream of Kriemhild forms a strange opening
600,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"for a lay that just brings Siegfried to Worms, and there leaves him."
601,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Nobody, in fact, would have composed a separate poem on so insignificant"
602,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"a matter. The dream, however, is beyond all doubt the introduction, the"
603,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"fit and appropriate introduction, to a poem that must go on at least to"
604,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,the marriage of Kriemhild and the death of her husband.
605,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
606,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"""Professor Lachmann himself seems to be in doubt whether this First Lay"
607,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"be complete; he talks of 'this lay, or what has been preserved of it;'"
608,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"he tells us that 'it several times indicates a continuation, and might"
609,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,have deserved a better than that which follows;' but though he expresses
610,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"a doubt, he gives no reasons for entertaining one. It certainly would"
611,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"require far less ingenuity to assign cogent reasons for a doubt, and"
612,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"indeed for much more than a doubt, on this point; the lay, as it stands,"
613,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"is a 'passage that leads to nothing,' a mountain in labor that does not"
614,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,produce even so much as a mouse; but it is not singular in this respect;
615,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"its brethren for the most part keep it in countenance; or, if they"
616,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"contain matter of interest, they too often try the temper of the reader"
617,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"by disappointing his expectations at the most critical moment, and"
618,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,coming to an abrupt conclusion in the midst of an action. Thus the
619,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,Eighteenth Lay ends just after the battle between Huns and Burgundians
620,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,has begun; the Nineteenth stops short just at the moment when Etzel has
621,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"brought up 20,000 fresh men and commenced another attack on Gunther and"
622,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,his followers.
623,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
624,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"""It really is a waste of words to dwell on the peculiarities of such"
625,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,whimsical arrangements as these. I will merely add a word or two on the
626,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Fourteenth Lay, which, inasmuch as it is an introduction to what"
627,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"follows, bears some resemblance to the First. The dream of Uta, the"
628,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"prophecy of the mermaids, and all the gloomy forebodings which give a"
629,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"peculiar character to this lay, are ludicrously out of place as"
630,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"component parts of a short poem, which merely conducts the Burgundians"
631,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"to Rudeger's castle, where, so far from being destroyed, they do not"
632,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"even run any risk whatever, except that of being killed with kindness;"
633,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"but in fact the whole tenor of the lay (one might almost say, every"
634,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"line, every word of it) proves beyond dispute that we are there in the"
635,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"midst of an extensive poem, which can end only with the destruction of"
636,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,the last Burgundian. An attentive examination of the three or four lays
637,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"just noticed, would, I think, convince every unprejudiced reader that"
638,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,the hypothesis of twenty separate lays by different authors is utterly
639,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"untenable.... The wisest course,"" he concludes, and it is easy to concur"
640,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"with him, ""is, in such uncertainty, to take the poem as we find it, and"
641,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"to prefer the authority, however occasionally unsatisfactory, of"
642,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"manuscripts to the speculations of the most ingenious critics."""
643,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
644,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"The metre of the ""Nibelungenlied"" needs a word of explanation. The"
645,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"characteristic strophe in which it is written consists of four verses,"
646,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"the first three of equal length, the fourth somewhat longer, rhymed in"
647,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"couplets on the final syllable. The rhythmical system is dependent, not"
648,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"upon measure, but upon accent, with considerable freedom in the"
649,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"addition or suppression of unaccented syllables. Every verse, with the"
650,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"exception of the last, is made up of two half-verses each containing"
651,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"three accented syllables and separated by a ringing cæsura, that is, a"
652,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,cæsura on an unaccented syllable. The last half-verse contains an
653,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"additional accent, or four, instead of three, as in the others. A"
654,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"strophe in the original Middle High German, the second of the poem, will"
655,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,make this analysis clear:
656,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
657,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Ez wúohs in Búregónden            ein vil édel magedîn,"
658,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"dáz in állen lánden           niht schoeners móhte sîn,"
659,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,Kríemhilt gehéizen:           diu wart ein schoene wîp
660,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,dar úmbe múosen dégene            víl verlíesen den lîp.
661,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
662,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"The metre of the present translation follows the original, except for"
663,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,the lengthening of the fourth line of the stanza which the author only
664,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,occasionally differentiates in this respect from the rest.
665,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
666,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"The ""Nibelungenlied,"" like other poems of the Middle Ages that were"
667,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"widely read and widely copied, was subjected all along its career of"
668,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"transmission to additions and alterations, and has consequently come"
669,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"down to us not in a single form, but in a number of different versions"
670,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,that deviate to a greater or less extent from the original poem and from
671,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,each other. Whole or in part there are no less than twenty-eight MSS.
672,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Ten of these are complete: three of them, usually cited A, B, C, are"
673,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"parchment MSS. of the thirteenth century, two are parchments of the"
674,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"fourteenth century, four are paper MSS. of the fifteenth century, and"
675,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,one is a parchment of the sixteenth century. Of all these manuscripts it
676,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"is commonly conceded that only A, B, C have independent authenticity. It"
677,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,is not necessary here to go into the details of the long discussion as
678,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,to the relative value of the MSS. with regard to the age and original
679,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,condition of the particular text which each contains. Each one has by
680,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,different critics been given the preference over the others.
681,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
682,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Zarncke, who is one of the most rational and impartial of the critics of"
683,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"the poem in all its bearings, makes C, a beautifully written MS. from"
684,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"the dividing line between the twelfth and thirteenth centuries,"
685,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"preserved in the court library of Donaueschingen, the nearest in every"
686,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"essential way to the original form of the poem. Subsequently, the"
687,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"whole, according to him, was subjected to a revision which brought it"
688,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,more into accord with contemporary taste. The text is amplified by the
689,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"introduction of new episodes into the narrative, although some of the"
690,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"older strophes are omitted, and, unfortunately, the old dignity and"
691,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,simplicity of the diction is frequently sacrificed in favor of a more
692,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,pronounced effect. This stage of the poem in its full form is not
693,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"represented in either of the oldest MSS. B, a manuscript from the middle"
694,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"of the thirteenth century, in the monastery of St. Gallen, occupied an"
695,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"intermediate position in length. It is made by Bartsch, who regards it"
696,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"""as relatively the most faithful picture of the original form of the"
697,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"lost poem,"" the basis of his edition of the ""Nibelungenlied."" A, a"
698,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"carelessly written MS. in the Munich Library, is the shortest form of"
699,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"the poem, but is, nevertheless, in its turn regarded by Lachmann as"
700,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,inherently the oldest and best version that we possess. Lettsom's
701,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"translation, in that it follows the text and modern German version of"
702,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Braunfels, published in 1846, is based upon A, but with the inclusion of"
703,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"other strophes, particularly from C."
704,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
705,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"The ""Nibelungenlied"" was first published at Zurich, by Bodmer, in 1757,"
706,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,and since then has appeared in many editions and modernized versions at
707,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"home, and in numerous translations abroad, among them Low German,"
708,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"French, Italian, Dutch, and Hungarian."
709,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
710,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"In English, the first translations of parts of the ""Nibelungenlied"" are"
711,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"contained in the ""Illustrations of Northern Antiquities,"" by Weber,"
712,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"published in 1814, in Edinburgh. The version here given consists in part"
713,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"only of a metrical translation, in part of prose. Lockhart, in his"
714,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"biography of Sir Walter Scott, states that he has no doubt but that the"
715,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"rhymed versions came from that poet's pen, although of this there is no"
716,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,more direct proof. The second attempt in this direction is not less
717,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"notable. This is from 1831, when Thomas Carlyle wrote in the"
718,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"""Westminster Review"" an essay on the ""Nibelungenlied"" as a review of"
719,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Karl Simrock's German translation of the poem, in which are contained a"
720,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,number of strophes given with characteristic vigor and a genuine
721,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"appreciation of the real spirit of the original. The next translation,"
722,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"that of Gostik, in his ""Spirit of German Poetry,"" 1846, is metrical,"
723,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"but, like its predecessors, consists only of parts of the poem. The"
724,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,first translation to lay claim to any degree of completeness was that of
725,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Jonathan Birch, published in 1848. It is a metrical version, as its"
726,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"title states, of Lachmann's text, and, like it, divides the poem into"
727,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"twenty lays. The first complete edition of the poem in English does not,"
728,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"however, appear until this of Lettsom's, which has admirably retained"
729,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"the form of the original and much of its spirit, and which for the first"
730,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,time gave to English readers an adequate idea of the real work as it is.
731,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,
732,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,For those who care to pursue the subject further than these pages it may
733,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"be stated that the best editions of the ""Nibelungenlied"" in the original"
734,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"are those of Friedrich Zarncke, ""_Das Nibelungenlied_,"" originally"
735,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"published in 1856 and since then in several editions, and of Karl"
736,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"Bartsch, ""_Das Nibelungenlied_,"" originally published in 1866, both of"
737,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"which have abundant critical apparatus. The ""Nibelungenlied"" is not yet"
738,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"sufficiently well known among us, for it is, in the way that has been"
739,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,"indicated, not alone the great epic of Germany, but in its widest sense"
740,SPECIAL INTRODUCTION,an epic of the Germanic race.

1044,I,"(Whose father was called Siegmund, his mother Siegelind)"
1045,I,In a sumptuous castle down by the Rhine's fair side;

1051,II,"I tell you of this warrior, how fair he was to see;"

1053,II,Forthwith fierce and famous wax'd the mighty man.

1058,III,
1059,III,"Siegfried men did call him, that same champion good;"

1066,IV,
1067,IV,"Before this noble champion grew up to man's estate,"
1068,IV,"His hand had mighty wonders achieved in war's debate,"
1069,IV,"Whereof the voice of rumor will ever sing and say,"

1083,VI,"As did well befit him, he was bred with care,"

1089,VII,VII
1090,VII,
1091,VII,"He now, grown up to youthhood, at court his duty paid;"

1103,VIII,
1104,VIII,
1105,IX,IX

1123,XI,Whosoe'er was worthy to become a knight
1124,XI,"For his lofty lineage, did they each invite,"

1131,XII,Of that proud feast royal wonders one might say;

1133,XII,"Win honor for the bounty they shower'd with lavish hand,"
1134,XII,For which full many a stranger came flocking through their land.

1137,XIII,XIII
1138,XIII,
1139,XIII,Sworded squires four hundred rich raiment had to wear
1140,XIII,With the noble Siegfried. Full many a maiden fair

1145,XIV,XIV
1146,XIV,
1147,XIV,"(For gold was there in plenty), and as each could best"
1148,XIV,For the love of Siegfried they work'd the jewel'd vest.
1149,XIV,The Host rais'd seats unnumber'd for many a martial wight
1150,XIV,On the fair midsummer when his heir was dubb'd a knight.
1151,XIV,
1152,XIV,
1153,XV,XV
1154,XV,
1155,XV,"Forthwith to the high minster flock'd many a squire along,"
1156,XV,And many a knight of worship. To fitly train the young
1157,XV,The old should lend that service which once to them was lent.
1158,XV,They pass'd the hours in pastime and gentle merriment.
1159,XV,
1160,XV,
1161,XVI,XVI
1162,XVI,
1163,XVI,"But first to God's due honor a holy mass they sung,"
1164,XVI,"And then a press and struggle arose the crowd among,"
1165,XVI,And then with pomp befitting each youth was dubb'd a knight.
1166,XVI,"In sooth, before was never seen so fair a sight."
1167,XVI,
1168,XVI,
1169,XVII,XVII
1170,XVII,
1171,XVII,"All ran at once, where saddled many a war-horse stood."
1172,XVII,"In the court of Siegmund the tourney was so rude,"
1173,XVII,"That both hall and palace echoed far around,"
1174,XVII,As those high-mettled champions shock'd with thundering sound.

1176,XVII,
1177,XVIII,XVIII
1178,XVIII,
1179,XVIII,"Old and young together fiercely hurtling flew,"
1180,XVIII,That the shiver'd lances swept the welkin through;
1181,XVIII,Splinters e'en to the palace went whizzing many a one
1182,XVIII,From hands of mighty champions; all there was deftly done.
1183,XVIII,
1184,XVIII,
1185,XIX,XIX
1186,XIX,
1187,XIX,The Host bade cease the tourney; the steeds were led away;
1188,XIX,"Then might you see, all shatter'd how many a shield there lay,"
1189,XIX,And store of stones full precious from bucklers beaming sheen
1190,XIX,In those fierce shocks were scatter'd upon the trampled green.

1195,XX,"Thence went the guests in order, and sat around the board;"

1203,XXI,"Albeit in ceaseless pastime they sent the livelong day,"
1204,XXI,The mummers and the minstrels never ceas'd their play.
1205,XXI,"They flock'd to golden largess, a roving frolic band,"
1206,XXI,And pour'd a flood of praises on Siegmund's fertile land.
1207,XXI,
1208,XXI,
1209,XXII,XXII
1210,XXII,
1211,XXII,"The king, too, as his father to him before had done,"
1212,XXII,Enfeoff'd with lands and castles Siegfried his youthful son;
1213,XXII,"Gifts to his sword-companions he gave with liberal hand,"
1214,XXII,"So glad was he, it pleased them to come into his land."
1215,XXII,
1216,XXII,
1217,XXIII,XXIII
1218,XXIII,
1219,XXIII,The gorgeous feast it lasted till the seventh day was o'er;
1220,XXIII,Siegelind the wealthy did as they did of yore;
1221,XXIII,"She won for valiant Siegfried the hearts of young and old,"
1222,XXIII,When for his sake among them she shower'd the ruddy gold.
1223,XXIII,
1224,XXIII,
1225,XXIV,XXIV
1226,XXIV,
1227,XXIV,You scarce could find one needy in all the minstrel band;
1228,XXIV,Horses and robes were scatter'd with ever open hand.
1229,XXIV,"They gave as though they had not another day to live,"
1230,XXIV,"None were to take so ready, as they inclin'd to give."
1231,XXIV,

1233,XXV,XXV
1234,XXV,
1235,XXV,So was dissolv'd with honor the mighty festival:
1236,XXV,"The high-descended Barons assembled there in hall,"
1237,XXV,"That youth were well contented as lord to serve and sue,"
1238,XXV,"But that desir'd not Siegfried, the champion stout and true."

1240,XXV,
1241,XXVI,XXVI
1242,XXVI,
1243,XXVI,"While Siegelind and Siegmund yet liv'd and flourished there,"
1244,XXVI,Full little reck'd their offspring the royal crown to wear.
1245,XXVI,"He only would be master and exercise command,"
1246,XXVI,'Gainst those whose pride o'erweening disturb'd the peaceful land.
1247,XXVI,
1248,XXVI,
1249,XXVII,XXVII
1250,XXVII,
1251,XXVII,"None ventur'd to defy him; since weapons first he took,"
1252,XXVII,The bed of sloth but seldom the noble knight could brook.
1253,XXVII,He only sought for battles; his prowess-gifted hand
1254,XXVII,Won him renown eternal in every foreign strand.

2428,XLVIII,From Ludegast's batter'd helmet. So strive they all they can
2429,XLVIII,And either stormy champion in th' other finds his man.

2431,XLVIII,
2432,XLIX,XLIX
2433,XLIX,
2434,XLIX,At Siegfried too Sir Ludegast struck many a sturdy stroke;
2435,XLIX,Each on his foeman's buckler his gather'd fury broke.
2436,XLIX,"Full thirty men of Ludegast's meanwhile had spied the fray,"
2437,XLIX,"But, ere they up could hasten, Siegfried had won the day."

2442,L,"Thrice smote he the bright breast-plate, and pierc'd it through"
2443,L,and through;
2444,L,"Thrice the blood in torrents from the king he drew,"
2445,L,Those three strokes have ended that encounter keen.
2446,L,Down sunk woful Ludegast grovelling on the green.

2449,LI,LI
2450,LI,
2451,LI,"He straight for life sued humbly, and yielded up his claim"

2453,LI,"On this up came his warriors, who from afar had seen"
2454,LI,"The fight, that at the ward-post so fiercely fought had been."
2455,LI,

2457,LII,LII
2458,LII,
2459,LII,"Thence Siegfried thought to bring him, when sudden all the band"
2460,LII,Of thirty set upon him; well then the hero's hand
2461,LII,Maintain'd his royal captive with many a mighty blow.
2462,LII,The peerless champion wrought them yet heavier loss and woe.

2467,LIII,He fought with all the thirty till all but one were slain;
2468,LIII,"To him his life he granted; he trembling rode amain,"
2469,LIII,And told the truth disastrous to all the gaping crew;
2470,LIII,"On his bloody helmet they might see it written, too."

2474,LIV,
2475,LIV,Woe were the men of Denmark to hear the deadly tale;
2476,LIV,Their king too was a captive; this added bale to bale.
2477,LIV,They told it to his brother; he straight to storm began.
2478,LIV,Wroth was he to have suffered such loss by arm of man.
2479,LIV,
2480,LIV,
2481,LV,LV
2482,LV,
2483,LV,So by the might of Siegfried was Ludegast led away
2484,LV,"To where the men of Gunther in watchful leaguer lay,"
2485,LV,And given in charge to Hagan; when they came to hear
2486,LV,"The prisoner was King Ludegast, they scarcely shed a tear."
2487,LV,
2488,LV,
2489,LVI,LVI
2490,LVI,

2508,LVIII,At once the glittering banner to the breeze was flung
2509,LVIII,By the bold minstrel Folker riding in the van;

2512,LVIII,
2513,LIX,LIX
2514,LIX,
2515,LIX,No more than e'en a thousand went on the hard emprise;
2516,LIX,With them twelve stranger champions. Now 'gan the dust arise
2517,LIX,Along the paths they trampled; they rode by copse and field
2518,LIX,And startled all the country with the flash of many a shield.

2524,LX,"Their swords they well were sharpen'd, as I have since been told."
2525,LX,"Keen cut the temper'd weapons in their well-practised hands,"

2539,LXII,Sindolt and Hunolt and noble Gernot too
2540,LXII,"In the fierce encounter many a champion slew,"
2541,LXII,"Who, ere they felt their puissance, little thought to quail;"
2542,LXII,Many a noble lady then had cause to wail.

2546,LXIII,
2547,LXIII,"Folker and Hagan, and eke the fierce Ortwine,"
2548,LXIII,"Death-defying champions, dimm'd many a helmet's shine"
2549,LXIII,With bloody streaming torrents that down began to run;
2550,LXIII,There too were by Dankwart mighty marvels done.
2551,LXIII,
2552,LXIII,
2553,LXIV,LXIV
2554,LXIV,
2555,LXIV,Every man of Denmark frankly tried his hand;
2556,LXIV,You might have heard a clatter ring throughout the land
2557,LXIV,"Of shiver'd shields and sword-blades; 'sooth the work was rough,"
2558,LXIV,And the hurtling Saxons damage did enough.
2559,LXIV,

2562,LXV,
2563,LXV,"Where the stern Burgundians plung'd into the strife,"
2564,LXV,"Many a wound was given, and let out many a life."
2565,LXV,The blood from that red slaughter above the saddles stood;
2566,LXV,Woo'd as a bride was honor by heroes bold and good.
2567,LXV,
2568,LXV,
2569,LXVI,LXVI
2570,LXVI,
2571,LXVI,But louder still and louder in every hero's hand
2572,LXVI,"Clash'd the keen-ground weapons, when those of Netherland"
2573,LXVI,Behind their charging master rush'd into the fight.
2574,LXVI,On they came with Siegfried; each bore him as a knight.
2575,LXVI,
2576,LXVI,
2577,LXVII,LXVII
2578,LXVII,
2579,LXVII,Not a lord of Rhineland could follow where he flew.
2580,LXVII,You might see red spouting the riven helmets through
2581,LXVII,"Sudden streams of slaughter where Siegfried smote around,"
2582,LXVII,Till he at last King Ludeger before his comrades found.

2594,LXIX,
2595,LXIX,"When the stalwart Ludeger saw noble Siegfried nigh,"
2596,LXIX,Who in his hand wide-wasting ever heav'd on high
2597,LXIX,"The storm-descending Balmung, and slew him many a slain,"
2598,LXIX,"Grimly frown'd the monarch, and burn'd with wrath amain."

2604,LXX,"When both the thick battalions each on the other dash'd,"
2605,LXX,Each angry leader panting to meet in stern debate.
2606,LXX,The crowd began to scatter; then fiercer rose their hate.
2607,LXX,
2608,LXX,
2609,LXXI,LXXI
2610,LXXI,
2611,LXXI,Well the Saxon ruler that day perform'd his part;

2613,LXXI,"He heard it first reported, Gernot the deed had done,"
2614,LXXI,"But now he knew for certain, 'twas Siegelind's conqu'ring son."

2619,LXXII,"So burly were the buffets which Ludeger dealt in field,"

2621,LXXII,"Soon as the steed recover'd, a fiercer passion stirr'd"

2623,LXXII,
2624,LXXII,
2625,LXXIII,LXXIII
2626,LXXIII,
2627,LXXIII,"Then up to help him Hagan, and up good Gernot sped,"
2628,LXXIII,Dankwart and Folker; round lay in heaps the dead;
2629,LXXIII,"And Sindolt came, and Hunolt, and the good knight Ortwine."
2630,LXXIII,Down sunk the Saxons trampled by the warriors of the Rhine.

2633,LXXIV,LXXIV
2634,LXXIV,
2635,LXXIV,"Close fought the chiefs, unsever'd 'spite of the hurtling bands"
2636,LXXIV,Then might you see the lances from mightiest heroes' hands
2637,LXXIV,"Fly o'er the nodding helmets, and pierce the bucklers through;"
2638,LXXIV,Many a glittering armor was dyed a bloody hue.
2639,LXXIV,
2640,LXXIV,
2641,LXXV,LXXV
2642,LXXV,
2643,LXXV,In the fierce encounter many a mighty man
2644,LXXV,Tumbled from the saddle; each on th' other ran
2645,LXXV,"Ludeger and Siegfried, each the other's peer;"
2646,LXXV,"Many a shaft was flying, whizzing many a spear."
2647,LXXV,
2648,LXXV,
2649,LXXVI,LXXVI
2650,LXXVI,
2651,LXXVI,Off flew Ludeger's shield-plate by dint of Siegfried's hand.
2652,LXXVI,Then look'd at last for conquest the knight of Netherland
2653,LXXVI,"Over the struggling Saxons, such force was in that stroke."
2654,LXXVI,Then too how many a breast-plate the strong-arm'd Dankwart broke!
2655,LXXVI,
2656,LXXVI,
2657,LXXVII,LXXVII
2658,LXXVII,
2659,LXXVII,Just then it chanc'd King Ludeger had a crown espied
2660,LXXVII,Painted upon the buckler that guarded Siegfried's side.
2661,LXXVII,"Straight knew the astonish'd Saxon, 'twas he, the mighty man,"
2662,LXXVII,And to his friends the hero to call aloud began.

2675,LXXIX,He bade them lower the banners; forthwith they lower'd them all;
2676,LXXIX,And peace he then demanded; 'twas granted at his call;
2677,LXXIX,But go he must a pris'ner to good King Gunther's land;
2678,LXXIX,This was from him extorted by Siegfried's conqu'ring hand.

2681,LXXX,LXXX
2682,LXXX,
2683,LXXX,With one accord agreeing the bloody strife they left;
2684,LXXX,"The shining shields all shiver'd, the helmets hack'd and cleft"
2685,LXXX,They laid aside o'er-wearied; whatever down they threw
2686,LXXX,Bore from Burgundian falchions a stain of bloody hue.

2689,LXXXI,LXXXI
2690,LXXXI,
2691,LXXXI,"They took whome'er it pleas'd them, none could their will gainsay."
2692,LXXXI,Gernot and valiant Hagan at once bade bear away
2693,LXXXI,"The faint and feeble wounded, and with them carried then"

2696,LXXXI,
2697,LXXXII,LXXXII
2698,LXXXII,
2699,LXXXII,With wailing back to Denmark the bootless warriors came;
2700,LXXXII,The late o'erweening Saxons bore off but loss and shame
2701,LXXXII,From that disastrous struggle; each hung his pensive head.

2703,LXXXII,
2704,LXXXII,
2705,LXXXIII,LXXXIII
2706,LXXXIII,
2707,LXXXIII,Anon they bade the sumpters be loaded for the Rhine;
2708,LXXXIII,And thus victorious Siegfried his perilous design
2709,LXXXIII,Had brought to full performance; well had he done in fight;

2877,CIV,"Well hast thou told thy story, so take thee costliest weed,"
2878,CIV,"Now straight I'll bid be brought thee ten marks of ruddy gold."""
2879,CIV,"No wonder, to rich ladies glad news are gladly told."
2880,CIV,

2882,CV,CV
2883,CV,
2884,CV,"Straightforth was brought the vesture, and down the gold was paid;"
2885,CV,"Then hurried to the windows full many a lovely maid,"
2886,CV,"And look'd out on the highway, nor long delay'd to spy"
2887,CV,The high-descended victors return'd to Burgundy.
2888,CV,
2889,CV,
2890,CVI,CVI
2891,CVI,
2892,CVI,The safe and sound came forward; the wounded did the same;
2893,CVI,Merry was the meeting; none fear'd reproach or blame.
2894,CVI,Forth rode the host to meet them; his mirth had no alloy;
2895,CVI,"The woe, that long had worn him, was now shut up in joy."
2896,CVI,
2897,CVI,
2898,CVII,CVII
2899,CVII,
2900,CVII,"His own full well receiv'd he, and well the strangers too;"
2901,CVII,"Sure nothing so befitting could wealthy monarch do,"
2902,CVII,Than kindly greet such victors as now his court had sought
2903,CVII,With gain of such clear honor from field so sternly fought.
2904,CVII,
2905,CVII,
2906,CVIII,CVIII
2907,CVIII,
2908,CVIII,"Then ask'd the noble Gunther of the conquering train,"
2909,CVIII,How many of his warriors had in the strife been slain.
2910,CVIII,There had been lost but sixty in the fight they won.
2911,CVIII,"They were mourn'd and forgotten, as with many has since been done."
2912,CVIII,
2913,CVIII,
2914,CIX,CIX
2915,CIX,
2916,CIX,"Th' unwounded bore exulting, grim trophies of the field,"
2917,CIX,"Full many a batter'd morion, full many a shiver'd shield."
2918,CIX,Before the hall of Gunther from horse the champions sprung;
2919,CIX,Around from joyful thousands one shout of welcome rung.
2920,CIX,
2921,CIX,
2922,CX,CX
2923,CX,
2924,CX,The warriors in the city were lodg'd as might be best;
2925,CX,The king with courteous service bade wait on every guest.
2926,CX,"He found the hurt fit chambers for tendance and repose,"
2927,CX,And prov'd his noble nature in the treatment of his foes.
2928,CX,
2929,CX,
2930,CXI,CXI
2931,CXI,
2932,CXI,"Thus he said to Ludegast, ""King Ludegast, welcome here."
2933,CXI,"Much at your hands I've suffer'd, and more had cause to fear"
2934,CXI,"But all's at full repaid me, if smooth my fortune run."
2935,CXI,"God requite my warriors! they well for me have done."""
2936,CXI,
2937,CXI,
2938,CXII,CXII
2939,CXII,
2940,CXII,"""Ay, you may gladly thank them,"" said Ludeger, ""'tis their due;"
2941,CXII,King ne'er had such high captives as they have won for you.
2942,CXII,"Meanwhile, for courteous treatment, good store of gold we'll bring,"
2943,CXII,"And look for such reception as king may claim from king."""
2944,CXII,
2945,CXII,
2946,CXIII,CXIII
2947,CXIII,
2948,CXIII,"""Take what you ask,"" said Gunther, ""both set I gladly free."
2949,CXIII,Still must I have assurance that here awhile with me
2950,CXIII,"My foes consent to tarry, and do not leave my land"
2951,CXIII,"Till peace be made between us."" To that King Ludeger gave his hand."
2952,CXIII,
2953,CXIII,
2954,CXIV,CXIV
2955,CXIV,
2956,CXIV,So now the kings to rest them were to their chambers led.
2957,CXIV,"With tender care the wounded were softly laid a-bed,"
2958,CXIV,While for the whole and hearty were pour'd the mead and wine.
2959,CXIV,Never were men so merry as these beside the Rhine.
2960,CXIV,
2961,CXIV,
2962,CXV,CXV
2963,CXV,
2964,CXV,"Attendants to safe keeping the batter'd bucklers bore,"
2965,CXV,"The blood-bespatter'd saddles, whereof was plenteous store,"
2966,CXV,"They hid, lest sight so sorry should make the women weep."
2967,CXV,Many a good knight o'erwearied home was glad to creep.
2968,CXV,
2969,CXV,
2970,CXVI,CXVI
2971,CXVI,
2972,CXVI,The guests from good King Gunther all noble treatment found.
2973,CXVI,With friends as well as strangers his country swarm'd around.
2974,CXVI,He bade for the sore wounded all needful aid be sought.
2975,CXVI,Where was their haughty courage? how low it now was brought!
2976,CXVI,
2977,CXVI,
2978,CXVII,CXVII
2979,CXVII,
2980,CXVII,"Whoe'er had skill in leechcraft was offer'd coin untold,"
2981,CXVII,"Silver without measure as well as glittering gold,"
2982,CXVII,To cure the fainting champions by wounds of war oppress'd.
2983,CXVII,"The bounteous monarch sent, too, rich gifts to every guest."
2984,CXVII,
2985,CXVII,
2986,CXVIII,CXVIII
2987,CXVIII,
2988,CXVIII,"Those who, of feasting weary, homeward sought to wend,"
2989,CXVIII,"Were press'd to tarry longer, as friend will deal with friend."
2990,CXVIII,"King Gunther call'd a council; he would his men requite,"
2991,CXVIII,Who for his sake so nobly had won that gallant fight.
2992,CXVIII,
2993,CXVIII,
2994,CXIX,CXIX
2995,CXIX,
2996,CXIX,"Then spake the good Sir Gernot, ""At present bid them go."
2997,CXIX,"When full six weeks are over, we'll let the warriors know,"
2998,CXIX,We here shall need their presence at feasting rich and high;
2999,CXIX,"Then will restor'd be many, who yet sore wounded lie."""
3000,CXIX,
3001,CXIX,
3002,CXX,CXX
3003,CXX,
3004,CXX,And now would noble Siegfried to Gunther bid adieu;
3005,CXX,Soon as the friendly monarch the warrior's purpose knew
3006,CXX,He lovingly besought him a longer stay to make.
3007,CXX,He ne'er had so consented but for his sister's sake.
3008,CXX,
3009,CXX,
3010,CXXI,CXXI
3011,CXXI,
3012,CXXI,"Besides, he was too wealthy to stoop to soldier's pay,"
3013,CXXI,"Albeit he well deserv'd it; him lov'd the more each day,"
3014,CXXI,"The king and all his kinsmen, who on the battle plain,"
3015,CXXI,"Had seen him deal destruction on Saxon and on Dane,"
3016,CXXI,
3017,CXXI,
3018,CXXII,CXXII
3019,CXXII,
3020,CXXII,"For the sake of that fair lady he yet would linger there,"
3021,CXXII,If he perchance might see her; and soon was eas'd his care.
3022,CXXII,"He came to know the maiden to his utmost heart's desire,"
3023,CXXII,Then home he rode rejoicing to the kingdom of his sire.
3024,CXXII,
3025,CXXII,
3026,CXXIII,CXXIII
3027,CXXIII,
3028,CXXIII,"The king bade practise knighthood and joust from day to day,"
3029,CXXIII,Well did his youthful warriors and willingly obey.
3030,CXXIII,Seats too before the city he rais'd along the strand
3031,CXXIII,For those who were to visit the fam'd Burgundian land.
3032,CXXIII,
3033,CXXIII,
3034,CXXIV,CXXIV
3035,CXXIV,
3036,CXXIV,"So bade the royal Gunther, and now the time was near,"
3037,CXXIV,"Ere came the joyful tidings to his fair sister's ear,"
3038,CXXIV,That he with his dear comrades high festival would hold.
3039,CXXIV,Then were fair women stirring; their toil was manifold.

3044,CXXV,"With kirtles, and with head-gear, and all that each should wear,"
3045,CXXV,"Uta, the rich and noble, amidst her maidens fair"
3046,CXXV,"Heard of coming warriors, a bold and haughty train;"
3047,CXXV,Straight was from out the wrappers store of rich vesture ta'en.

3049,CXXV,
3050,CXXVI,CXXVI
3051,CXXVI,
3052,CXXVI,"For the sake of her dear children the garments forth were laid,"
3053,CXXVI,"Wherewith array'd were richly many a wife and many a maid,"
3054,CXXVI,And many a youthful champion of warlike Burgundy;

3114,VII,VII
3115,VII,
3116,VII,"'Twas on a Whitsun' morning the warriors you might see,"
3117,VII,"Five thousand men or better, fair pricking o'er the lea,"

3155,XII,
3156,XII,"""'Tis well advis'd,"" said Gunther, ""I straight will do my part."""
3157,XII,Whoever heard his answer was inly glad at heart.
3158,XII,Then bade he Lady Uta and her fair daughter call

3161,XII,
3162,XIII,XIII
3163,XIII,
3164,XIII,"In haste through all the presses for rich attire they sought,"

3172,XIV,"Many a young knight that morning, within his flutt'ring breast,"

3176,XIV,
3177,XIV,
3178,XV,XV
3179,XV,
3180,XV,Then bade the wealthy monarch with royal pomp and state
3181,XV,"Of his men a hundred on his sister wait,"
3182,XV,His and the maiden's kinsmen; each carried sword in hand.
3183,XV,These were the chosen courtiers of Burgundy's fair land.

3195,XVII,
3196,XVII,On from bower advancing they came in fair array;
3197,XVII,Much press was there of heroes along the crowded way

3199,XVII,The fairest and the noblest of the noble and the fair.

3201,XVII,
3202,XVIII,XVIII
3203,XVIII,
3204,XVIII,"Now went she forth, the loveliest, as forth the morning goes"
3205,XVIII,From misty clouds out-beaming; then all his weary woes
3206,XVIII,"Left him, in heart who bore her, and so, long time, had done."

3208,XVIII,
3209,XVIII,
3210,XIX,XIX
3211,XIX,
3212,XIX,Many a stone full precious flash'd from her vesture bright;
3213,XIX,"Her rosy blushes darted a softer, milder light."
3214,XIX,"Whate'er might be his wishes, each could not but confess,"
3215,XIX,He ne'er on earth had witness'd such perfect loveliness.
3216,XIX,

3220,XX,As the moon arising outglitters every star
3221,XX,"That through the clouds so purely glimmers from afar,"
3222,XX,E'en so love-breathing Kriemhild dimm'd every beauty nigh.
3223,XX,Well might at such a vision many a bold heart beat high.

3225,XX,
3226,XXI,XXI
3227,XXI,
3228,XXI,Rich chamberlains before them march'd on in order due;

3231,XXI,Then inly was Sir Siegfried both well and ill apaid.
3232,XXI,
3233,XXI,
3234,XXII,XXII
3235,XXII,
3236,XXII,"Within himself thus thought he: ""How could I thus misdeem"
3237,XXII,That I should dare to woo thee? sure 'twas an idle dream!
3238,XXII,"Yet, rather than forsake thee, far better were I dead."""
3239,XXII,"Thus thinking, thus impassion'd, wax'd he ever white and red."

3242,XXIII,XXIII

3246,XXIII,"By some good master's cunning; all own'd, and could no less,"
3247,XXIII,Eye had not seen a pattern of such fair manliness.
3248,XXIII,

3250,XXIV,XXIV
3251,XXIV,
3252,XXIV,"Those, who the dames attended, bade all around make way;"
3253,XXIV,"Straight did the gentle warriors, as such became, obey."
3254,XXIV,"There many a knight, enraptur'd, saw many a dame in place"
3255,XXIV,Shine forth in bright perfection of courtliness and grace.
3256,XXIV,
3257,XXIV,
3258,XXV,XXV
3259,XXV,
3260,XXV,"Then the bold Burgundian, Sir Gernot, spoke his thought,"
3261,XXV,"""Him, who in hour of peril his aid so frankly brought,"
3262,XXV,"Requite, dear brother Gunther, as fits both him and you,"

3286,XXVIII,To see and meet so friendly fair Uta's fairer child.
3287,XXVIII,Then greeted she the warrior maidenly and mild.

3294,XXIX,"""Sir Siegfried, you are welcome, noble knight and good!"""
3295,XXIX,Yet loftier at that greeting rose his lofty mood.

3297,XXIX,
3298,XXX,XXX
3299,XXX,
3300,XXX,"He bow'd with soft emotion, and thank'd the blushing fair;"

3349,XXXVI,Straight went to church the maiden in royal rich array
3350,XXXVI,"With a bold train of warriors, a fair and courtly sight."
3351,XXXVI,There soon from her was parted the lofty-minded knight.

3372,XXXIX,"When now before the minster after the mass she stood,"
3373,XXXIX,Again to come beside her was call'd the champion good.
3374,XXXIX,"Then first by that sweet maiden thanks to the knight were given,"

3428,XLVI,The host of that high festal all and some had cheer

3492,LIV,Many a shield heap'd with treasure was brought at Gunther's call;

3588,IV,"This heard a noble warrior who dwelt the Rhine beside,"

3819,XXXIII,"""Now sit thee down, dear brother, and tell me frank and free,"""
3820,XXXIII,"Said the royal maiden, ""who these dames may be,"
3821,XXXIII,"Whom you would go a-courting in a distant land."""
3822,XXXIII,Both the chosen warriors then took she by the hand.
3823,XXXIII,
3824,XXXIII,
3825,XXXIV,XXXIV
3826,XXXIV,
3827,XXXIV,Anon she both led thither where before she sat
3828,XXXIV,"On rich embroider'd cushions (I can vouch for that),"
3829,XXXIV,O'erwrought with goodly figures well rais'd in glitt'ring gold.
3830,XXXIV,There they with the fair lady might gentle converse hold.

3837,XXXV,He in his heart enshrin'd her; she was to him as life.
3838,XXXV,Thereafter lovely Kriemhild became bold Siegfried's wife.
3839,XXXV,
3840,XXXV,
3841,XXXVI,XXXVI
3842,XXXVI,
3843,XXXVI,"Then said to her King Gunther, ""Right noble sister mine,"
3844,XXXVI,What I wish can never be but with help of thine.
3845,XXXVI,"We'll to the land of Brunhild to take our pastime there,"
3846,XXXVI,"And must before the lady princely apparel wear."""
3847,XXXVI,
3848,XXXVI,
3849,XXXVII,XXXVII
3850,XXXVII,
3851,XXXVII,"Then spake the queen in answer, ""Right loving brother mine,"
3852,XXXVII,"If ought I can will profit whatever end of thine,"
3853,XXXVII,Depend on me to do it; thou'lt find me ready still.
3854,XXXVII,"If any aught denied thee, 'twould please thy Kriemhild ill."

3856,XXXVII,
3857,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
3858,XXXVIII,
3859,XXXVIII,"""Noble knight, thou should'st not, as doubting, ask and pray,"
3860,XXXVIII,"But, as my lord and master, command, and I'll obey."
3861,XXXVIII,"Thou'lt find me, whatsoever thou hast in heart to do,"
3862,XXXVIII,"Not more a loving sister than a servant true."""
3863,XXXVIII,
3864,XXXVIII,
3865,XXXIX,XXXIX
3866,XXXIX,
3867,XXXIX,"""Dearest sister Kriemhild, we must wear costly weed,"
3868,XXXIX,"And therewith to equip us thy snowy hand we need,"
3869,XXXIX,"And let thy maids their utmost upon the same bestow,"

3875,XL,"Then spoke the noble virgin, ""Mark now what I say;"
3876,XL,"I've silk myself in plenty; on shields, as best you may,"
3877,XL,Precious stones bid bring us to work the clothes withal.
3878,XL,Gunther and eke Siegfried bade bring them at her call.

3881,XLI,XLI
3882,XLI,
3883,XLI,"""And who are the companions,"" ask'd the royal maid,"
3884,XLI,"""Who you to court will follow thus gorgeously array'd?"""
3885,XLI,"""We're four in all,"" he answer'd; ""two of my men beside,"

3895,XLII,
3896,XLII,
3897,XLIII,XLIII
3898,XLIII,
3899,XLIII,So with kind dismissal away the warriors strode.
3900,XLIII,Then quick the fair queen summon'd from bowers where they abode
3901,XLIII,"Thirty maids, her brother's purpose to fulfil,"
3902,XLIII,Who in works of the needle were the chief for craft and skill.
3903,XLIII,
3904,XLIII,
3905,XLIV,XLIV
3906,XLIV,
3907,XLIV,"Silks from far Arabia, white as driven snow,"

3909,XLIV,"They deck'd with stones full precious; Kriemhild the garments plann'd,"
3910,XLIV,And cut them to just measure with her own lily hand.

3912,XLIV,
3913,XLV,XLV
3914,XLV,
3915,XLV,Of the hides of foreign fishes were linings finely wrought;
3916,XLV,"Such then were seen but rarely, and choice and precious thought;"
3917,XLV,Fine silk was sewn above them to suit the wearers well.

3921,XLVI,XLVI

3923,XLVI,From the land of Morocco and from the Libyan coast
3924,XLVI,The best silk and the finest e'er worn and valued most
3925,XLVI,"By kin of mightiest princes, of such had they good store."
3926,XLVI,Well Kriemhild show'd the favor that she the wearers bore.

3931,XLVII,"E'er since the chiefs were purpos'd the martial queen to win,"

3933,XLVII,"With coal-black spots besprinkled on whiter ground than snow,"
3934,XLVII,E'en now the pride of warriors at every festal show.
3935,XLVII,
3936,XLVII,
3937,XLVIII,XLVIII
3938,XLVIII,
3939,XLVIII,Many a stone full precious gleam'd from Arabian gold;
3940,XLVIII,"That the women were not idle, scarcely need be told."
3941,XLVIII,"Within seven weeks, now ready was the vesture bright,"
3942,XLVIII,Ready too the weapons of each death-daring knight.

3947,XLIX,"Now when all was ready, by the Rhine you might mark"
3948,XLIX,"Built with skill and labor a stout though little bark,"
3949,XLIX,Wherein a-down the river to sea they were to go.
3950,XLIX,To the noble maidens their toil brought mickle woe.

3954,L,
3955,L,"When now 'twas told the champions, that the vesture gay,"

3959,L,
3960,L,
3961,LI,LI
3962,LI,
3963,LI,"So to their loving comrades a messenger was sent,"

3970,LII,
3971,LII,"Whomever met the warriors, all could not but admire;"
3972,LII,In all the world not any had seen such fair attire;

3980,LIII,"Meanwhile, on point of parting for a far and dangerous soil,"
3981,LIII,"The warriors would of Kriemhild take leave in knightly wise,"

3987,LIV,"Said she, ""Why thus, dear brother, to foreign regions run?"
3988,LIV,"Stay here and woo another; that were far better done,"

3995,LV,"Their hearts, I ween, foreboded what thence was to befall."
3996,LV,"How spake they ever boldly, sore wept they one and all."
3997,LV,Their tears the gold o'ermoisten'd that on their breasts they wore;

4005,LVI,"That no mischance beset him in Brunhild's fatal land."""
4006,LVI,"Straight promis'd he the maiden, and clasp'd her clay-cold hand."

4011,LVII,"Then spake the loving champion, ""Long as I have life,"

4013,LVII,I'll bring you back your brother safe and well a-pay'd;

4026,LIX,
4027,LIX,Fair maids stood at the windows as they hoisted sail;

4029,LIX,So on the Rhine were seated the comrades frank and free;
4030,LIX,"Then said good King Gunther, ""Who shall our steersman be?"""

4036,LX,Well the tides and currents how they shift and flow.
4037,LX,"Trust me, good knight, to pilot you and your company."""

4042,LXI,
4043,LXI,"With that straight seiz'd Sir Siegfried a pole that lay at hand,"
4044,LXI,And with strong effort straining 'gan push off from the strand;
4045,LXI,Gunther himself as ready took in hand an oar;
4046,LXI,So fell off the vessel and parted from the shore.
4047,LXI,
4048,LXI,
4049,LXII,LXII
4050,LXII,
4051,LXII,"They had on board rich viands, thereto good store of wine,"
4052,LXII,The best that could be met with e'en on the banks of Rhine.
4053,LXII,Their steeds in easy quarters stood tractable and still;
4054,LXII,The level bark ran smoothly; nothing with them went ill.

4056,LXII,
4057,LXIII,LXIII
4058,LXIII,
4059,LXIII,"Their sail swell'd to the breezes, the ropes were stretch'd and tight;"
4060,LXIII,Miles they ran full twenty ere the fall of night.
4061,LXIII,With a fair wind to seaward down dropp'd the gallant crew.
4062,LXIII,Their dames had cause long after their high emprise to rue.

4067,LXIV,"By the twelfth bright morning, as we have heard it told,"

4180,VI,"For the rude eyes of strangers; they bow'd to her behest,"
4181,VI,"But what next did the ladies, we since have heard confest."
4182,VI,
4183,VI,
4184,VII,VII

4739,LXXVI,"On high the stone she lifted rugged and round and rude,"
4740,LXXVI,"And brandish'd it with fury, and far before her flung,"

4746,LXXVII,"Twelve fathoms' length or better the mighty mass was thrown,"

4764,LXXIX,"Brunhild was red with anger, quick came her panting breath"

4928,IV,
4929,IV,Alone the champion landed in a meadow wide;
4930,IV,"Straight to the shore securely the little bark he tied,"

4961,VIII,"Now had the fearless giant all his weapons donn'd,"

5024,XVI,
5025,XVI,With mighty hands undaunted in on the dwarf he ran;

5098,XXV,At the proud court of Brunhild our richest robes will need.

5663,XLVI,
5664,XLVI,"The best stuffs and the richest, that e'er were found, they bore"
5665,XLVI,To meet the stranger heroes; every robe they wore
5666,XLVI,With care and skill was chosen to suit their lovely hue.
5667,XLVI,"He were a fool, who'd murmur at one of that fair crew."

5669,XLVI,
5670,XLVII,XLVII
5671,XLVII,
5672,XLVII,"Of sable and of ermine many a robe was there,"
5673,XLVII,And many a sparkling bracelet o'er silken raiment fair
5674,XLVII,The wrists and arms encircled of many a lady gay.
5675,XLVII,"The care, the taste, the splendor none might at full display."
5676,XLVII,
5677,XLVII,
5678,XLVIII,XLVIII
5679,XLVIII,
5680,XLVIII,"Many a glittering girdle, that rich and long down hung,"
5681,XLVIII,By many a snowy finger o'er gorgeous weed was flung
5682,XLVIII,To bind the far-brought garment of stuff from Araby.
5683,XLVIII,Each noble damsel's bosom swell'd high and joyfully.

5686,XLIX,XLIX
5687,XLIX,
5688,XLIX,In the tighten'd bodice many a smiling maid
5689,XLIX,Had laced herself full deftly; each were ill appaid
5690,XLIX,Did not her bright complexion outshine her vesture sheen.
5691,XLIX,A train so fair and graceful now has ne'er a queen.

5709,I,I
5710,I,
5711,I,"Beyond the Rhine King Gunther, with many a well-arm'd rank"
5712,I,"And all his guests about him, rode toward the river's bank;"
5713,I,You might see by the bridle led forward many a maid.
5714,I,"Those, who were to receive them, were ready all array'd."
5715,I,
5716,I,
5717,II,II
5718,II,
5719,II,"Soon as the men of Issland came to the shallops down,"
5720,II,"And eke the Nibelungers, lieges of Siegfried's crown,"
5721,II,To th' other shore they hasten'd (busy was ever hand)
5722,II,Where them the friends of Gunther awaited on the strand.
5723,II,
5724,II,
5725,III,III
5726,III,
5727,III,"Now hear, by wealthy Uta what a device was wrought."
5728,III,"Down with her from the castle a virgin train she brought,"
5729,III,That rode where she was riding in that procession bright;
5730,III,So many a maid acquainted became with many a knight.
5731,III,
5732,III,
5733,IV,IV
5734,IV,
5735,IV,Kriemhild by the bridle the Margrave Gary led.
5736,IV,"But only from the castle; then forward Siegfried sped,"
5737,IV,And did that gentle service; fair was the blushing maid;
5738,IV,Full well for that thereafter the warrior she repaid.
5739,IV,
5740,IV,
5741,V,V
5742,V,
5743,V,"Ortwine, the fearless champion, rode by Dame Uta's rein;"
5744,V,"Knights and maids together followed, a social train."
5745,V,"At such a stately meeting, all must confess, I ween,"
5746,V,So many lovely ladies were ne'er together seen.
5747,V,
5748,V,
5749,VI,VI
5750,VI,
5751,VI,Full many a famous champion careering you might spy
5752,VI,(Ill there were sloth and idless) beneath fair Kriemhild's eye
5753,VI,E'en to the place of landing; by knights of fair renown
5754,VI,There many a high-born lady from steed was lifted down.
5755,VI,
5756,VI,
5757,VII,VII
5758,VII,
5759,VII,"The king was now come over, and many a worthy guest."
5760,VII,Ah! before the ladies what spears were laid in rest!
5761,VII,How many went in shivers at every hurtling close!
5762,VII,Buckler clashed with buckler; ah! what a din arose!
5763,VII,
5764,VII,
5765,VIII,VIII
5766,VIII,
5767,VIII,Now might you see the ladies fast by the haven stand.
5768,VIII,"With his guests King Gunther debark'd upon the strand,"
5769,VIII,In his hand soft leading the martial maiden fair.
5770,VIII,"Then each on each flash'd radiance, rich robes and jewels rare."
5771,VIII,
5772,VIII,
5773,IX,IX
5774,IX,
5775,IX,"With that the smiling Kriemhild forth stepp'd a little space,"
5776,IX,And Brunhild and her meiny greeted with gentle grace.
5777,IX,"Each with snowy fingers back her headband drew,"
5778,IX,And either kiss'd the other lovingly and true.
5779,IX,
5780,IX,
5781,X,X
5782,X,
5783,X,"Then spoke in courteous manner Kriemhild the fair and free,"
5784,X,"""In this our land, dear Brunhild, ever welcome be"
5785,X,To me and to my mother and all by us allow'd
5786,X,"For faithful friends and liegemen,"" Then each to th' other bow'd."
5787,X,
5788,X,
5789,XI,XI
5790,XI,
5791,XI,Next to greet Dame Brunhild approach'd Dame Uta too;
5792,XI,"Oft she and oft her daughter their arms around her threw,"
5793,XI,And on her sweet mouth lavish'd many a loving kiss.
5794,XI,Never was known a welcome so kind and frank as this.
5795,XI,
5796,XI,
5797,XII,XII
5798,XII,
5799,XII,"Soon as Brunhild's women were all come to the strand,"
5800,XII,Many a courtly warrior took by her lily hand
5801,XII,"A lady fair, and gently her mincing steps upstay'd."
5802,XII,Now before Dame Brunhild stood many a noble maid.
5803,XII,
5804,XII,
5805,XIII,XIII
5806,XIII,
5807,XIII,'Twas long before the greeting had gone through all the list.
5808,XIII,On either part in plenty rosy mouths were kiss'd.
5809,XIII,"Still the two fair princesses were standing side by side,"
5810,XIII,A pair with love and rapture by longing warriors ey'd.
5811,XIII,
5812,XIII,
5813,XIV,XIV
5814,XIV,
5815,XIV,"What erst had been but rumor, was now made clear to sight,"
5816,XIV,That naught had yet been witness'd so beautiful and bright
5817,XIV,As those two lovely damsels; 'twas plain to every eye;
5818,XIV,None the slightest blemish in either form could spy.
5819,XIV,
5820,XIV,
5821,XV,XV
5822,XV,
5823,XV,"Whoever look'd on women with but the sight for guide,"
5824,XV,Such for her faultless beauty prais'd Gunther's stately bride;
5825,XV,"But those, whose thoughts went deeper, and div'd into the mind,"
5826,XV,Maintained that gentle Kriemhild left Brunhild far behind.
5827,XV,
5828,XV,
5829,XVI,XVI
5830,XVI,
5831,XVI,Now met the dames and damsels in friendly converse free;
5832,XVI,Fair robes and fairer beauties were there in store to see;
5833,XVI,Many a silk pavilion and many a gorgous tent
5834,XVI,The plain before the city fill'd in its whole extent.
5835,XVI,
5836,XVI,
5837,XVII,XVII
5838,XVII,
5839,XVII,King Gunther's kinsmen ceas'd not to press to that fair show.
5840,XVII,And now was begg'd each princess from the sun to go
5841,XVII,"Close by, with their attendants, where shade was overhead."
5842,XVII,By bold Burgundian warriors thither were they led.
5843,XVII,
5844,XVII,
5845,XVIII,XVIII
5846,XVIII,
5847,XVIII,"Then clomb to horse the heroes, and scour'd the sounding field;"
5848,XVIII,Many a joust was practised with order'd spear and shield;
5849,XVIII,"Right well were prov'd the champions, and o'er the trampled plain,"
5850,XVIII,"As though the land were burning, the dust curl'd up amain."
5851,XVIII,
5852,XVIII,
5853,XIX,XIX
5854,XIX,
5855,XIX,So all before the ladies display'd their skill and force.
5856,XIX,Nor doubt I that Sir Siegfried rode many a knightly course
5857,XIX,"Before the rich pavilions, and, ever as he sped,"
5858,XIX,"His thousand Nibelungers, a stately squadron, led."
5859,XIX,
5860,XIX,
5861,XX,XX
5862,XX,
5863,XX,Then came the knight of Trony by the good king's command;
5864,XX,"In friendly wise he parted the jousters on the strand,"
5865,XX,"For fear the dust, now thick'ning, the ladies might molest."
5866,XX,Him with ready reverence obey'd each gentle guest.
5867,XX,
5868,XX,
5869,XXI,XXI
5870,XXI,
5871,XXI,"Then spake the noble Gernot, ""Let each now rest his steed"
5872,XXI,"Till the air be cooler, 't will then be our's to lead"
5873,XXI,These lovely ladies homeward e'en to the palace wide.
5874,XXI,"So keep yourselves all ready till it please the king to ride."""
5875,XXI,
5876,XXI,
5877,XXII,XXII
5878,XXII,
5879,XXII,"Thus ended was the tourney, and now the warriors went"
5880,XXII,"To join the dames and damsels beneath each lofty tent,"
5881,XXII,And there in gentle converse their grace and favor sought;
5882,XXII,So flew the hours in pastime till of riding home they thought.
5883,XXII,
5884,XXII,
5885,XXIII,XXIII
5886,XXIII,
5887,XXIII,"Now as drew on the twilight, when cooler grew the air"
5888,XXIII,"And the sun was setting, they would not linger there,"
5889,XXIII,But up rose lords and ladies to seek the castle high;
5890,XXIII,Many a fair dame was cherish'd by many a love-lit eye.
5891,XXIII,
5892,XXIII,
5893,XXIV,XXIV
5894,XXIV,
5895,XXIV,So on the fair they waited as from good knights is due.
5896,XXIV,"Then hardy squires, hot-spurring before the nobles' view,"
5897,XXIV,After the country's custom rode for the prize of weed
5898,XXIV,"As far as to the palace, where sprung the king from steed."
5899,XXIV,
5900,XXIV,
5901,XXV,XXV
5902,XXV,
5903,XXV,"There too the proud queens parted, each taking thence her way."
5904,XXV,Dame Uta and her daughter with their handmaids gay
5905,XXV,Into a spacious chamber both together went.
5906,XXV,There might you hear on all sides the sound of merriment.
5907,XXV,
5908,XXV,
5909,XXVI,XXVI
5910,XXVI,
5911,XXVI,In hall the seats were order'd; the king would instant hie
5912,XXVI,With all his guests to table; beside him you might spy
5913,XXVI,"His lovely bride, Queen Brunhild; her royal crown she wore"
5914,XXVI,There in King Gunther's country; so rich was none before.
5915,XXVI,
5916,XXVI,
5917,XXVII,XXVII
5918,XXVII,
5919,XXVII,"Seats were there plac'd unnumber'd with tables broad and good,"
5920,XXVII,"As is to us reported, full heap'd with costly food."
5921,XXVII,How little there was wanted that passes for the best!
5922,XXVII,There with the king was seated full many a noble guest.
5923,XXVII,
5924,XXVII,
5925,XXVIII,XXVIII
5926,XXVIII,
5927,XXVIII,The chamberlains of Gunther in ewers of ruddy gold
5928,XXVIII,Brought to the guests the water; should you be ever told
5929,XXVIII,"That at a prince's table service was better done,"
5930,XXVIII,"'Twere labor lost to say so, 't would be believ'd by none."
5931,XXVIII,
5932,XXVIII,
5933,XXIX,XXIX
5934,XXIX,
5935,XXIX,"Then, ere the Lord of Rhineland touch'd the water bright,"
5936,XXIX,"Up to him, as befitted, went Siegfried the good knight,"
5937,XXIX,"And brought to him remembrance the promise made him there,"
5938,XXIX,Ere yet afar in Issland he look'd on Brunhild fair.
5939,XXIX,
5940,XXIX,
5941,XXX,XXX
5942,XXX,
5943,XXX,"Said he, ""You must remember what swore to me your hand,"
5944,XXX,"That, soon as Lady Brunhild were come into this land,"
5945,XXX,To me you'd give your sister; your oaths now where are they?
5946,XXX,"On me throughout your journey much toil and travail lay."""
5947,XXX,
5948,XXX,
5949,XXXI,XXXI
5950,XXXI,
5951,XXXI,"""Well did you to remind me,"" the noble king replied,"
5952,XXXI,"""By what my hand has promis'd, I ever will abide,"
5953,XXXI,"And in this thing to serve you will do my best, my all."""
5954,XXXI,Then sent he to beg Kriemhild to come into the hall.
5955,XXXI,
5956,XXXI,
5957,XXXII,XXXII
5958,XXXII,
5959,XXXII,"Straight to the hall came Kriemhild begirt with many a maid,"
5960,XXXII,"When from the lofty staircase young Giselher thus said,"
5961,XXXII,"""Send back your maidens, Kriemhild, this business is your own;"
5962,XXXII,"On this the king our brother would speak with you alone."""
5963,XXXII,
5964,XXXII,
5965,XXXIII,XXXIII
5966,XXXIII,
5967,XXXIII,"Then forward led was Kriemhild, as Gunther gave command,"
5968,XXXIII,"Where stood the king, and round him from many a prince's land"
5969,XXXIII,Were noble knights unnumber'd; at once all silence kept;
5970,XXXIII,At that same instant Brunhild had just to table stepp'd.
5971,XXXIII,
5972,XXXIII,
5973,XXXIV,XXXIV
5974,XXXIV,
5975,XXXIV,"Thence came it, she knew nothing of what was to be done."
5976,XXXIV,"Then to his gather'd kinsmen spoke Dankrat's royal son,"
5977,XXXIV,"""Help me to move my sister Siegfried for lord to take."""
5978,XXXIV,"""Such match,"" they all gave answer, ""with honor she may make."""
5979,XXXIV,
5980,XXXIV,
5981,XXXV,XXXV
5982,XXXV,
5983,XXXV,"Then spoke the king to Kriemhild, ""Sister, I ask of thee"
5984,XXXV,From an oath to set me by thy kindness free.
5985,XXXV,"Thee to a knight I promised; if thou become his bride,"
5986,XXXV,"Thou'lt do the will of Gunther, and show thy love beside."""
5987,XXXV,
5988,XXXV,
5989,XXXVI,XXXVI
5990,XXXVI,
5991,XXXVI,"Then spake the noble maiden, ""Dearest brother mine,"
5992,XXXVI,"It needed not to ask me; whate'er command be thine,"
5993,XXXVI,"I'll willingly perform it; so now, for thy sake,"
5994,XXXVI,"Whom thou for husband giv'st me, fain I, my lord, will take."""
5995,XXXVI,
5996,XXXVI,
5997,XXXVII,XXXVII
5998,XXXVII,
5999,XXXVII,With love and eke with pleasure redden'd Siegfried's hue;
6000,XXXVII,At once to lady Kriemhild he pledg'd his service true.
6001,XXXVII,They bade them stand together in the courtly circle bright.
6002,XXXVII,And ask'd her if for husband she took that lofty knight.
6003,XXXVII,
6004,XXXVII,
6005,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
6006,XXXVIII,
6007,XXXVIII,"In modest maiden fashion she blush'd a little space,"
6008,XXXVIII,"But such was Siegfried's fortune and his earnest grace,"
6009,XXXVIII,That not altogether could she deny her hand.
6010,XXXVIII,Then her for wife acknowledg'd the noble King of Netherland.
6011,XXXVIII,
6012,XXXVIII,
6013,XXXIX,XXXIX
6014,XXXIX,
6015,XXXIX,"He thus to her affianc'd, and to him the maid,"
6016,XXXIX,Straight round the long-sought damsel in blushing grace array'd
6017,XXXIX,"His arms with soft emotion th' enamour'd warrior threw,"
6018,XXXIX,And kiss'd the high-born princess before that glitt'ring crew.
6019,XXXIX,
6020,XXXIX,
6021,XL,XL
6022,XL,
6023,XL,"On this up broke the circle, and to the feast they came;"
6024,XL,There high-advanc'd Sir Siegfried sat with his spoused dame
6025,XL,Right opposite to Gunther; him many a vassal true
6026,XL,"Serv'd at the board, and near him his Nibelungers drew."
6027,XL,
6028,XL,
6029,XLI,XLI
6030,XLI,
6031,XLI,"High at the feast sat Gunther and Brunhild by his side,"
6032,XLI,"But woe was then the maiden, when Kriemhild she espied"
6033,XLI,"Sitting by valiant Siegfried; she straight began to weep,"
6034,XLI,And her bright visage darken'd with shame and passion deep.
6035,XLI,
6036,XLI,
6037,XLII,XLII
6038,XLII,
6039,XLII,"Then spake the king of Rhineland, ""What ails you, lady mine,"
6040,XLII,"That your fair eyes are clouded, and dimm'd their beamy shine?"
6041,XLII,"You rather should be merry, now that my liegemen true,"
6042,XLII,"My country and my castles are subject all to you."""
6043,XLII,
6044,XLII,
6045,XLIII,XLIII
6046,XLIII,
6047,XLIII,"""Good cause have I for weeping,"" return'd the angry fair;"
6048,XLIII,"""My very heart is bleeding to see your sister there"
6049,XLIII,Beside your lowly vassal sitting so content;
6050,XLIII,"Never shall I cease weeping for such disparagement."""
6051,XLIII,
6052,XLIII,
6053,XLIV,XLIV
6054,XLIV,
6055,XLIV,"Then spake the noble Gunther, ""No more of this, I pray;"
6056,XLIV,"You shall be told the reason on some other day,"
6057,XLIV,Wherefore I to Siegfried my sister gave for wife.
6058,XLIV,"May she with him ever lead a happy life!"""
6059,XLIV,
6060,XLIV,
6061,XLV,XLV
6062,XLV,
6063,XLV,"Quoth she, ""I sorrow ever for her grace and beauty's sake;"
6064,XLV,"Had I a place to fly to, my flight I hence would take,"
6065,XLV,"For lie will I never, King Gunther, by your side,"
6066,XLV,"Ere I know why Kriemhild is given for Siegfried's bride."""
6067,XLV,
6068,XLV,
6069,XLVI,XLVI
6070,XLVI,
6071,XLVI,"Thereto made answer Gunther, ""That will I tell you straight."
6072,XLVI,"Know, I have given my sister to no unequal mate:"
6073,XLVI,"A mighty king is Siegfried, and unto him belong,"
6074,XLVI,"As to their rightful sovran, broad lands and castles strong."""
6075,XLVI,
6076,XLVI,
6077,XLVII,XLVII
6078,XLVII,
6079,XLVII,"Whatever he could tell her, her gloomy mood she kept."
6080,XLVII,Then from the board to tilting many a warrior stepp'd.
6081,XLVII,The noise of their tourney made all the castle ring.
6082,XLVII,His guests and their amusements wearied sore the king.
6083,XLVII,
6084,XLVII,
6085,XLVIII,XLVIII
6086,XLVIII,
6087,XLVIII,"Thought he, 't were softer lying in a marriage bed."
6088,XLVIII,"Then, to beguile annoyance, his longing heart he fed"
6089,XLVIII,"With thought of future pleasure from love of such a bride,"
6090,XLVIII,And ever Lady Brunhild tenderly he ey'd.
6091,XLVIII,
6092,XLVIII,
6093,XLIX,XLIX
6094,XLIX,
6095,XLIX,"The guests were bid give over the tourney, as was meet."
6096,XLIX,The king with his fair lady would now to bed retreat.
6097,XLIX,Before the hall's grand staircase Kriemhild and Brunhild met;
6098,XLIX,Bitterness or rancor on neither side was yet.
6099,XLIX,
6100,XLIX,
6101,L,L
6102,L,
6103,L,Then came th' attendant courtiers; they lingered now for nought;
6104,L,Chamberlains well-apparel'd the tapers to them brought.
6105,L,The followers then divided of the rulers twain;
6106,L,Then might you see with Siegfried go forth a num'rous train.
6107,L,
6108,L,
6109,LI,LI
6110,LI,
6111,LI,And now the royal bridegrooms both to their chambers came;
6112,LI,"Each thought with fond caresses to woo his gentle dame,"
6113,LI,"That both might, as befitted, in love's soft bonds agree."
6114,LI,The night to noble Siegfried was sweet as sweet might be.
6115,LI,
6116,LI,
6117,LII,LII
6118,LII,
6119,LII,"There lay he so delighted by lovely Kriemhild's side,"
6120,LII,"And found such modest graces in his virgin bride,"
6121,LII,That he came to love her more than his proper life.
6122,LII,Well she deserv'd his passion as a virtuous wife.
6123,LII,
6124,LII,
6125,LIII,LIII
6126,LIII,
6127,LIII,What more ensued between them it needs not here to say.
6128,LIII,"Now you must hear the story, how King Gunther lay"
6129,LIII,By the fair Lady Brunhild. Many a loving swain
6130,LIII,By his loving helpmate with more content has lain.

6133,LIV,LIV
6134,LIV,
6135,LIV,"The crowd had now all vanish'd, that tended them before;"
6136,LIV,Of the marriage chamber fast was made the door.
6137,LIV,"He deem'd he now was shortly to win his lovely mate,"
6138,LIV,But for that happy moment he yet had long to wait.
6139,LIV,
6140,LIV,
6141,LV,LV
6142,LV,
6143,LV,In robe of whitest linen to the bed she pass'd;
6144,LV,"Then thought the noble Gunther, ""Now all is mine at last,"
6145,LV,"That I ever long'd for before in all my life."""
6146,LV,Needs must be blest a husband in such a charming wife.
6147,LV,
6148,LV,
6149,LVI,LVI
6150,LVI,
6151,LVI,"And now with trembling fingers 'gan he shroud the light,"
6152,LVI,"Then went with glad expectance where lay his lady bright,"
6153,LVI,"And laid him down beside her, nor small the joy he knew,"
6154,LVI,When his arms around her tenderly he threw.
6155,LVI,
6156,LVI,
6157,LVII,LVII
6158,LVII,
6159,LVII,"Fain would he have caress'd her as gentle love inspires,"
6160,LVII,Had but the wayward maiden granted his desires;
6161,LVII,"But there he sore was troubled, so fiercely storm'd his mate."
6162,LVII,"He look'd for fond affection, and met with deadly hate."
6163,LVII,
6164,LVII,
6165,LVIII,LVIII
6166,LVIII,
6167,LVIII,"""Sir knight,"" said she, ""it suits not--you'd better leave me free"
6168,LVIII,From all your present purpose--it must and shall not be.
6169,LVIII,A maid still will I keep me (think well the matter o'er)
6170,LVIII,"Till I am told that story."" This fretted Gunther sore."
6171,LVIII,
6172,LVIII,
6173,LIX,LIX
6174,LIX,
6175,LIX,Then for her love he struggled e'en till her robe he rent;
6176,LIX,"With that, up caught the maiden a cord with fell intent"
6177,LIX,"(About her waist she wore it, strong was the same and tough),"
6178,LIX,And wrought her lord and master shame and wrong enough.
6179,LIX,
6180,LIX,
6181,LX,LX
6182,LX,
6183,LX,"The feet and hands of Gunther she tied together all,"
6184,LX,"Then to a nail she bore him, and hung him 'gainst the wall,"
6185,LX,"And bade him not disturb her, nor breathe of love a breath."
6186,LX,Sure from the doughty damsel he all but met his death.

6199,LXII,"How he far'd she reck'd not, while soft herself she lay;"
6200,LXII,"So all night long he dangled perforce till break of day,"
6201,LXII,When through the chamber window the light began to peep.
6202,LXII,That night was Gunther's pleasure as little as his sleep.
6203,LXII,
6204,LXII,
6205,LXIII,LXIII
6206,LXIII,
6207,LXIII,"""Now tell me, good Sir Gunther,"" began the froward fair,"

6221,LXV,LXV
6222,LXV,
6223,LXV,"With that the maid unbound him; free stood he, but half dead;"
6224,LXV,"Then all aghast and trembling back totter'd to the bed,"
6225,LXV,And there lay down so distant that her night-dress fair
6226,LXV,"He seldom touch'd, if ever; e'en that she well could spare."
6227,LXV,
6228,LXV,
6229,LXVI,LXVI
6230,LXVI,
6231,LXVI,Now in came their attendants; by these in hand were borne
6232,LXVI,New gaudy robes in plenty to suit the marriage morn.
6233,LXVI,Downcast he stood and moody amidst the smiling band.
6234,LXVI,Their mirth seem'd out of season to the monarch of the land.

6236,LXVI,
6237,LXVII,LXVII
6238,LXVII,
6239,LXVII,"After the good old custom that in that land was kept,"
6240,LXVII,"King Gunther and Queen Brunhild forth from the chamber stepp'd,"
6241,LXVII,"And hied them to the minster, where the mass was sung."
6242,LXVII,Thither too came Sir Siegfried; then rose a press the crowd among.

6245,LXVIII,LXVIII
6246,LXVIII,
6247,LXVIII,Each circumstance of honor for monarch and his mate

6249,LXVIII,"Then consecrated were they, and, soon as that was o'er,"
6250,LXVIII,With jewel'd crowns conspicuous stood all the goodly four.
6251,LXVIII,
6252,LXVIII,
6253,LXIX,LXIX
6254,LXIX,
6255,LXIX,Bold squires with sword were girded six hundred at the least
6256,LXIX,In honor of the rulers at that high marriage feast.
6257,LXIX,"Was nought but mirth and joyance in Burgundy to hear,"
6258,LXIX,"And swashing of the buckler, and clattering of the spear."

6261,LXX,LXX
6262,LXX,
6263,LXX,"There too at many a window sat many a laughing maid,"
6264,LXX,To view in mimic terror far-flashing arms display'd;
6265,LXX,"But still, whate'er was toward, kept the sad king apart,"
6266,LXX,With gloom upon his visage and anguish at his heart.

6269,LXXI,LXXI
6270,LXXI,
6271,LXXI,'Twixt him and good Sir Siegfried what difference of mood!

6276,LXXI,
6277,LXXII,LXXII
6278,LXXII,
6279,LXXII,"Then to his guest said Gunther, ""Shame, alas! and strife,"
6280,LXXII,"My friend, I home have brought me in my wayward wife."
6281,LXXII,"No sooner came I near her, what did she do, but tie"
6282,LXXII,"My feet and hands together, and hang me up on high?"

6289,LXXIII,"I breathe my plaint in friendship to thy secret ear."""
6290,LXXIII,"Then spake the noble Siegfried; ""It irks me, what I hear;"

6297,LXXIV,"And never more your pleasure with froward freaks delay."""
6298,LXXIV,At this from all his troubles wax'd Gunther blithe and gay.

6301,LXXV,LXXV
6302,LXXV,
6303,LXXV,"""Look at my wrists and fingers swoln with her cursed bands;"

6305,LXXV,Under each nail forth started the blood beneath her grasp.
6306,LXXV,"As for my life, I thought it e'en then at the last gasp."""
6307,LXXV,

6309,LXXVI,LXXVI
6310,LXXVI,
6311,LXXVI,"Thereto replied Sir Siegfried, ""All will again come right;"
6312,LXXVI,We two were most unequal in fortune yesternight.
6313,LXXVI,To me thy sister Kriemhild is dear as is my life.
6314,LXXVI,Now must Dame Brunhild also be made a loving wife.

6346,LXXX,The king with full affiance took Siegfried's words for true.

6351,LXXXI,The knights were busy tilting with good success or ill;
6352,LXXXI,"Straight 'twas bidd'n the tourney should all be hush'd and still,"
6353,LXXXI,For to the hall was coming either royal bride.
6354,LXXXI,Then chamberlains advancing bade stand the crowd aside.

6356,LXXXI,
6357,LXXXII,LXXXII
6358,LXXXII,
6359,LXXXII,"The court was clear'd of horses, the crowd no longer seen;"
6360,LXXXII,Then forth a reverend bishop led either lofty queen
6361,LXXXII,"To where the kings were seated, and tables richly stor'd."
6362,LXXXII,Them many a man of worship follow'd to the board.
6363,LXXXII,
6364,LXXXII,
6365,LXXXIII,LXXXIII
6366,LXXXIII,
6367,LXXXIII,"There by his stately consort sat Gunther well appaid,"
6368,LXXXIII,Musing upon the promise to him by Siegfried made.
6369,LXXXIII,That single day to Gunther seem'd thirty days at least.
6370,LXXXIII,On the love of Brunhild he thought throughout the feast.

6372,LXXXIII,
6373,LXXXIV,LXXXIV
6374,LXXXIV,
6375,LXXXIV,Scarcely could wait the monarch till from the board they rose;
6376,LXXXIV,"Brunhild and lovely Kriemhild were summon'd to repose,"
6377,LXXXIV,Each in her several chamber; ah! what a crowd was seen
6378,LXXXIV,Of young and active warriors before each stately queen!

6380,LXXXIV,
6381,LXXXV,LXXXV
6382,LXXXV,
6383,LXXXV,Siegfried was fondly seated by his gentle bride;
6384,LXXXV,"Her slender snowy fingers, as leant they side by side"
6385,LXXXV,With his were softly toying; in midst of her caress
6386,LXXXV,"Suddenly he vanish'd--how, she could not guess."

6388,LXXXV,
6389,LXXXVI,LXXXVI
6390,LXXXVI,
6391,LXXXVI,"As with him she was playing, she miss'd him quite and clean."
6392,LXXXVI,"""Ha!"" to his wilder'd courtiers cried out the wilder'd queen,"
6393,LXXXVI,"""Where's the king? what portent is this? what semblance fine?"
6394,LXXXVI,"He was but now beside me--who snatch'd his hand from mine?"""

6399,LXXXVII,She stopp'd in speechless wonder; he quick had slipp'd away
6400,LXXXVII,"To where with lights th' attendants stood ranged in meet array,"
6401,LXXXVII,And straight 'gan dout the tapers held by the pages there;
6402,LXXXVII,Full well that it was Siegfried was Gunther then aware.

6405,LXXXVIII,LXXXVIII
6406,LXXXVIII,
6407,LXXXVIII,"He knew what was to follow, so sent forth every one,"
6408,LXXXVIII,"Maid and dame, from the chamber; then soon as this was done,"
6409,LXXXVIII,"With his own hand impatient the king lock'd fast the door,"
6410,LXXXVIII,And two strong bolts of iron shot for assurance more.

6412,LXXXVIII,
6413,LXXXIX,LXXXIX
6414,LXXXIX,
6415,LXXXIX,Behind the flowing hangings the lights he huddled all;
6416,LXXXIX,Forthwith began a pastime (as could not but befall)
6417,LXXXIX,Betwixt the sinewy Siegfried and the maiden fair.
6418,LXXXIX,At once with joy and sorrow stood Gunther trembling there.

6441,XCII,Him from the bed with fury against a bench she flung.

6444,XCII,
6445,XCIII,XCIII
6446,XCIII,
6447,XCIII,With all his might upstarted again th' undaunted man;
6448,XCIII,"He'd try his fortune better; a struggle stern began,"
6449,XCIII,When he essay'd to quell her; long was his toil and sore;
6450,XCIII,"Such strife, I ween, will never be waged by woman more."

6521,CII,"How fierce soe'er she struggled, faint and more faint she grew;"

6576,CIX,Her stormy rage was soften'd; she was no more the same;
6577,CIX,Weak she grew and feeble as in his arms she lay;
6578,CIX,All her former puissance flitted straight away.
6579,CIX,
6580,CIX,
6581,CX,CX
6582,CX,
6583,CX,And now was she no stronger than any dame beside.
6584,CX,"Fearless, unfear'd, her husband caress'd his duteous bride."
6585,CX,Why act again the rebel? what boot could thus be won?
6586,CX,So much with alter'd Brunhild King Gunther's love had done.
6587,CX,
6588,CX,
6589,CXI,CXI
6590,CXI,
6591,CXI,How lovingly and fondly he by his lady lay
6592,CXI,Till the rosy morning led on the laughing day!
6593,CXI,"Sir Siegfried thence departed, and back in silence came,"
6594,CXI,Where tenderly receiv'd him a fair and gentle dame.

6596,CXI,
6597,CXII,CXII
6598,CXII,
6599,CXII,"Her questions he evaded, though much to know she sought;"
6600,CXII,"Long time too kept he from her the gifts that he had brought,"
6601,CXII,"Till, crown'd, in his own country she reign'd, his royal bride;"
6602,CXII,"Of all, he else could grant her, how little he denied!"
6603,CXII,
6604,CXII,
6605,CXIII,CXIII
6606,CXIII,
6607,CXIII,Far merrier in the morning than he before had been
6608,CXIII,Appear'd the good King Gunther; the change with joy was seen
6609,CXIII,"By every faithful vassal, and every foreign guest,"
6610,CXIII,Whom he had home invited and feasted with the best.
6611,CXIII,
6612,CXIII,
6613,CXIV,CXIV
6614,CXIV,
6615,CXIV,"The sumptuous festal lasted e'en to the fourteenth day,"
6616,CXIV,"The while was heard unceasing the sound of mirth and play,"
6617,CXIV,That in the crowd of pleasures the wilder'd guests were lost.
6618,CXIV,Unmatch'd was Gunther's splendor and boundless was his cost.
6619,CXIV,
6620,CXIV,
6621,CXV,CXV
6622,CXV,
6623,CXV,"By the good king's order, to many a warrior bold"
6624,CXV,"His kinsmen in his honor gave robes and ruddy gold,"
6625,CXV,"And steeds and store of silver, and so their wants supplied,"
6626,CXV,That not a stranger was there but parted satisfied.
6627,CXV,
6628,CXV,
6629,CXVI,CXVI
6630,CXVI,
6631,CXVI,"As well good King Siegfried, the knight of Netherland,"
6632,CXVI,"And his thousand champions their robes, with liberal hand,"
6633,CXVI,"And all they had brought thither alike were pleas'd to give,"
6634,CXVI,Fair steeds and costly trappings; like nobles they knew how to live.
6635,CXVI,
6636,CXVI,
6637,CXVII,CXVII
6638,CXVII,
6639,CXVII,"To those, whose thoughts were homeward, the hours seem'd all too long,"
6640,CXVII,Ere the rich gifts were lavish'd among the gladsome throng.
6641,CXVII,Never before was party dismiss'd in merrier plight.
6642,CXVII,So the high feast concluded; thence off rode many a knight.

7053,XVI,In the weary journey three toilsome weeks they spent.
7054,XVI,"At last in Niblung's castle, whither they had been sent,"
7055,XVI,"E'en in the march of Norway, they found king Siegmund's son."
7056,XVI,Horses alike and riders were travel-tainted and fordone.
7057,XVI,
7058,XVI,
7059,XVII,XVII
7060,XVII,
7061,XVII,"To Siegfried and to Kriemhild forthwith the tidings came,"
7062,XVII,"That knights had journey'd thither, whose venture was the same"
7063,XVII,As what by men of worship was born in Burgundy.
7064,XVII,From her day-bed Kriemhild up sprung hastily.
7065,XVII,
7066,XVII,
7067,XVIII,XVIII
7068,XVIII,
7069,XVIII,"Sudden to a window she bade a damsel go,"
7070,XVIII,"Who saw bold Gary standing in the court below,"
7071,XVIII,"Him, and his valiant comrades on the same errand bound."
7072,XVIII,For her long-brooded sorrow what rapture then she found!
7073,XVIII,
7074,XVIII,
7075,XIX,XIX
7076,XIX,
7077,XIX,"Loud call'd she to her husband, ""See you, where they stand"
7078,XIX,"Down in the court there waiting, stout Gary and his band,"
7079,XIX,"Whom my good brother Gunther has sent us down the Rhine?"""
7080,XIX,"""Welcome are they,"" said Siegfried, ""welcome to me and mine."""
7081,XIX,
7082,XIX,
7083,XX,XX
7084,XX,
7085,XX,"Where they saw them standing, all the household ran;"
7086,XX,"They kindly then saluted, as man encounter'd man,"
7087,XX,"And, as they best could please them, spoke many a friendly word,"
7088,XX,With no small joy King Siegmund of their arrival heard.
7089,XX,
7090,XX,
7091,XXI,XXI
7092,XXI,
7093,XXI,"Straight were allotted quarters to Gary and his men,"
7094,XXI,And charge ta'en of their courses; the messengers went then
7095,XXI,To where sat bold Sir Siegfried by gentle Kriemhild's side;
7096,XXI,"They were to court invited, and so they thither hied."
7097,XXI,
7098,XXI,
7099,XXII,XXII
7100,XXII,
7101,XXII,"Uprose, as in they enter'd, the host and his fair dame."
7102,XXII,"Full well receiv'd was Gary, and all who with him came"
7103,XXII,"His followers, Gunther's liegemen from distant Burgundy."
7104,XXII,To a seat the warrior was motion'd courteously.

7106,XXII,
7107,XXIII,XXIII
7108,XXIII,
7109,XXIII,"""Nay, deign,"" said he, ""our message to hear before we sit,"
7110,XXIII,"And us, way-wearied wanderers, the while to stand permit."
7111,XXIII,We have to tell you tidings to us committed late
7112,XXIII,"By Gunther and by Brunhild, who are both in best estate;"
7113,XXIII,
7114,XXIII,
7115,XXIV,XXIV
7116,XXIV,
7117,XXIV,"""And from the Lady Uta we come, your mother dear,"
7118,XXIV,"And from the good Sir Gernot and youthful Giselher,"
7119,XXIV,"And from your choicest kinsmen, who all with kind intent"
7120,XXIV,"By us to you their service from Burgundy have sent."""
7121,XXIV,
7122,XXIV,
7123,XXV,XXV
7124,XXV,
7125,XXV,"""Now God then quit!"" said Siegfried, ""that they're sincere and true,"
7126,XXV,"I trust with full assurance, as men with friends should do."
7127,XXV,"The same too feels their sister. Now further to us tell,"
7128,XXV,Whether our friends in Rhineland are hearty all and well.
7129,XXV,
7130,XXV,
7131,XXVI,XXVI
7132,XXVI,
7133,XXVI,"""Since we from them departed, has any neighboring foe"
7134,XXVI,Harried my consort's kindred? this let me surely know.
7135,XXVI,"To them by me shall ever such friendly aid be lent,"

7137,XXVI,
7138,XXVI,
7139,XXVII,XXVII
7140,XXVII,
7141,XXVII,"Thereto the Margrave Gary, the good knight, made reply,"
7142,XXVII,"""Fraught with all manly virtues they bear them proud and high."
7143,XXVII,"They bid you to a festal, which they at home prepare."
7144,XXVII,"You need not doubt, your kinsmen would gladly see you there."
7145,XXVII,
7146,XXVII,
7147,XXVIII,XXVIII
7148,XXVIII,
7149,XXVIII,"""They also beg my lady thither with you to wend,"
7150,XXVIII,"Soon as the blustering winter shall come at length to end,"
7151,XXVIII,"You both ere next midsummer they all expect to see."""
7152,XXVIII,"Then said the valiant Siegfried, ""That can hardly be."""
7153,XXVIII,
7154,XXVIII,
7155,XXIX,XXIX
7156,XXIX,
7157,XXIX,"But straight the bold Burgundian Gary gave this reply,"
7158,XXIX,"""Surely your mother Uta you never can deny,"
7159,XXIX,"Nor Giselher, nor Gernot, who all would meet you fain."
7160,XXIX,"That you dwell so far distant, I hear them daily plain."
7161,XXIX,
7162,XXIX,
7163,XXX,XXX
7164,XXX,
7165,XXX,"""Brunhild, my noble lady, and all her maidens fair,"
7166,XXX,Are glad to think that forthwith you thither will repair.
7167,XXX,"That they once more may see you, fills every heart with glee."""
7168,XXX,His words to lovely Kriemhild seem'd full good to be.
7169,XXX,
7170,XXX,
7171,XXXI,XXXI
7172,XXXI,
7173,XXXI,"Gary was her kinsman; him begg'd the host to sit,"
7174,XXXI,"And straight bade fill the goblets to pledge them, as was fit;"
7175,XXXI,"Then too, to meet the envoys, King Siegmund join'd the rest,"
7176,XXXI,And to the bold Burgundians these friendly words address'd:
7177,XXXI,
7178,XXXI,
7179,XXXII,XXXII
7180,XXXII,
7181,XXXII,"""Welcome, ye men of Gunther! since Siegfried, my good son,"

7183,XXXII,You at our court more frequent we should have gladly seen.
7184,XXXII,"Your presence of our friendship the surest bond had been."""
7185,XXXII,
7186,XXXII,
7187,XXXIII,XXXIII
7188,XXXIII,
7189,XXXIII,"They said, whene'er he wish'd it, they willingly would come."
7190,XXXIII,Their toil and teen through gladness forgot they all and some.
7191,XXXIII,"Siegfried bade all be seated, and viands of the best,"
7192,XXXIII,"And in full abundance, be brought to every guest."
7193,XXXIII,
7194,XXXIII,
7195,XXXIV,XXXIV
7196,XXXIV,
7197,XXXIV,Nine days in mirth and feasting the envoys needs must stay.
7198,XXXIV,At length the active warriors could brook no more delay.
7199,XXXIV,Again would they ride homeward; on that their minds were bent
7200,XXXIV,In th' interval King Siegfried for his friends had sent.
7201,XXXIV,
7202,XXXIV,
7203,XXXV,XXXV
7204,XXXV,
7205,XXXV,He ask'd them what they counsel'd; he needs must to the Rhine;
7206,XXXV,"""I bidden am by Gunther that dear friend of mine."
7207,XXXV,At a high feast my presence he and his kinsmen pray.
7208,XXXV,"Fain would I ride thither, were't not so far away."
7209,XXXV,
7210,XXXV,
7211,XXXVI,XXXVI
7212,XXXVI,
7213,XXXVI,"""They beg moreover, Kriemhild the journey too may share."
7214,XXXVI,"Now, my good friends, advise me; what's best to do, declare."
7215,XXXVI,"Should they for them request me to harry thirty lands,"
7216,XXXVI,"Well they such warlike service might claim at Siegfried's hands."""
7217,XXXVI,
7218,XXXVI,
7219,XXXVII,XXXVII
7220,XXXVII,
7221,XXXVII,"Thereto his knights thus answer'd, ""As you desire to speed,"
7222,XXXVII,"If you this feast will visit, hearken to our rede."
7223,XXXVII,Take of your best warriors a thousand by your side.
7224,XXXVII,"So 'midst the bold Burgundians in honor you'll abide."""
7225,XXXVII,
7226,XXXVII,
7227,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
7228,XXXVIII,
7229,XXXVIII,"Then spake the lord of Netherland, Siegmund the frank and free,"
7230,XXXVIII,"""If you're for this high festal, why say not so to me?"
7231,XXXVIII,"I, if it not displease you, will with you to the Rhine,"
7232,XXXVIII,"And bring, to swell your squadron, a hundred knights of mine."""

7235,XXXIX,XXXIX
7236,XXXIX,
7237,XXXIX,"""Will you too journey with us, my father ever dear?"""
7238,XXXIX,"Exclaim'd the bold Sir Siegfried; ""it glads me this to hear."
7239,XXXIX,"Within twelve days at furthest we'll wend upon our way."""
7240,XXXIX,"To all, who ask'd, then gave he good steeds and garments gay."

7243,XL,XL
7244,XL,
7245,XL,"When now to take the journey fix'd was the king's design,"
7246,XL,"He bade the knights of Gunther ride back unto the Rhine,"
7247,XL,"And sent by them a message to Kriemhild's kinsmen there,"
7248,XL,"That to the feast, they purpos'd, full fain would he repair."
7249,XL,
7250,XL,
7251,XLI,XLI
7252,XLI,
7253,XLI,Siegfried and Kriemhild (so says the tale) bestow'd
7254,XLI,"More gifts upon the envoys, than o'er such length of road"
7255,XLI,Their horses home could carry; a wealthy man was he.
7256,XLI,They drove their strong-back'd sumpters merrily o'er the lea.

7258,XLI,
7259,XLII,XLII
7260,XLII,
7261,XLII,Siegfried and eke Siegmund their people cloth'd anew;

7263,XLII,"Bade seek out women's raiment, whate'er was stored in chest"

7265,XLII,
7266,XLII,
7267,XLIII,XLIII
7268,XLIII,
7269,XLIII,"Rich saddles were made ready, and shields of glittering pride."
7270,XLIII,"To the knights and ladies, that should with Siegfried ride,"
7271,XLIII,Whate'er they wish'd was granted; none wanted there for ought.
7272,XLIII,To his friends in Rhineland many a lordly guest he brought.
7273,XLIII,
7274,XLIII,
7275,XLIV,XLIV
7276,XLIV,
7277,XLIV,Meanwhile homeward speeding prick'd the envoys fast.
7278,XLIV,Back came the noble Gary to Burgundy at last.
7279,XLIV,He met with hearty welcome; straight they dismounted all
7280,XLIV,From war-horse and from palfrey before King Gunther's hall.

7283,XLV,XLV
7284,XLV,
7285,XLV,"Old and young (as the use is) ran up from every side,"
7286,XLV,"And ask'd what news they brought them? the noble knights replied,"
7287,XLV,"""When I the king have told it, 'twill spread to all around."""
7288,XLV,Then went he with his comrades to where the king he found.
7289,XLV,
7290,XLV,
7291,XLVI,XLVI
7292,XLVI,
7293,XLVI,From sheer pleasure Gunther started from his seat

7523,XIX,
7524,XIX,The power of mighty Hagan and eke of bold Ortwine
7525,XIX,Well there might each beholder from what he saw divine.
7526,XIX,"Whate'er they pleas'd to order, from all obedience won;"
7527,XIX,To the lov'd guests by either was courtly service done.
7528,XIX,

7530,XX,XX
7531,XX,
7532,XX,The shields they clang'd and clatter'd before the castle gate
7533,XX,With fencing and with foining; long time had there to wait
7534,XX,His guests and good King Gunther ere they could enter in.
7535,XX,They pass'd the time right joyous amidst the press and din.
7536,XX,
7537,XX,
7538,XXI,XXI
7539,XXI,
7540,XXI,So to the spacious palace on rode they merrily.
7541,XXI,"You might see rich foot-cloths, well cut and artfully,"
7542,XXI,Down hang from o'er the saddle of many a high-born dame.
7543,XXI,Forward to receive them King Gunther's servants came.
7544,XXI,
7545,XXI,
7546,XXII,XXII
7547,XXII,
7548,XXII,Then to their several chambers the guests were led aside.
7549,XXII,From time to time Queen Brunhild with searching glances eyed
7550,XXII,The love-enkindling Kriemhild; lovely she was indeed;
7551,XXII,Her hue the gold outsparkled that glitter'd in her weed.
7552,XXII,
7553,XXII,
7554,XXIII,XXIII
7555,XXIII,
7556,XXIII,At Worms through all the city rang the mirthsome shout
7557,XXIII,Of the rejoicing followers; Gunther the noisy rout
7558,XXIII,"Commended to his marshal, and bade him treat them fair;"
7559,XXIII,Dankwart sought out good quarters and fitly lodg'd them there.
7560,XXIII,
7561,XXIII,
7562,XXIV,XXIV
7563,XXIV,
7564,XXIV,"Without, within, was feasting; unbounded was the store."
7565,XXIV,Sure stranger guests were never treated so well before.
7566,XXIV,"It only needed asking, and all was straight supplied;"
7567,XXIV,So rich a king was Gunther that nothing was denied.
7568,XXIV,
7569,XXIV,
7570,XXV,XXV
7571,XXV,
7572,XXV,"With friendly zeal they serv'd them, with hearts devoid of hate;"
7573,XXV,Amidst his guests at table the host exulting sate.
7574,XXV,To sit was bidden Siegfried where he of yore had done.
7575,XXV,With him strode to the banquet proud warriors many a one.
7576,XXV,
7577,XXV,
7578,XXVI,XXVI
7579,XXVI,
7580,XXVI,Twelve hundred stalwart champions in circle there were seen
7581,XXVI,"With him at table sitting; Brunhild, the watchful queen,"
7582,XXVI,"Thought to herself, no vassal could ever wealthier be."
7583,XXVI,"Still him she so far favor'd, that from harm she left him free."
7584,XXVI,
7585,XXVI,
7586,XXVII,XXVII
7587,XXVII,
7588,XXVII,"All that feastful evening, as sat the king to dine,"
7589,XXVII,"Store of the richest vesture was wetted by the wine,"
7590,XXVII,That in hasty hurry the butlers ever pour'd.
7591,XXVII,Sore toil'd they in their service at that o'ercrowded board.
7592,XXVII,
7593,XXVII,
7594,XXVIII,XXVIII
7595,XXVIII,
7596,XXVIII,"Then, as is still the custom at each well-order'd feast,"
7597,XXVIII,To rest the dames and damsels were in good time releas'd.
7598,XXVIII,"All guests with gifts and honors, from whenceso'er they came,"
7599,XXVIII,The noble host entreated as well beseem'd his fame.
7600,XXVIII,
7601,XXVIII,
7602,XXIX,XXIX
7603,XXIX,
7604,XXIX,"When now the night was over, and reappear'd the dawn,"
7605,XXIX,"By the fair hands of ladies was many a jewel drawn,"
7606,XXIX,"Sparkling in goodly raiment, from many a travelling chest,"
7607,XXIX,And out was sought and hurried many a lordly vest.

7610,XXX,XXX
7611,XXX,
7612,XXX,"Ere 'twas full day, came flocking the palace hall around"
7613,XXX,Knights and squires in plenty; then arose the sound
7614,XXX,"Of matins sung to Gunther, and, when this was done,"
7615,XXX,"So well rode youthful warriors, that the king's thanks they won."
7616,XXX,
7617,XXX,
7618,XXXI,XXXI
7619,XXXI,
7620,XXXI,Shrill fifes and loud-voic'd clarions and blaring trumpet-clang
7621,XXXI,"Mix'd with the shouts of thousands, that all the city rang,"
7622,XXXI,And through the startled welkin th' alarum spread around.
7623,XXXI,Proud knights on strong-hoof'd chargers rode thund'ring
7624,XXXI,o'er the ground.
7625,XXXI,
7626,XXXI,
7627,XXXII,XXXII
7628,XXXII,
7629,XXXII,At once without the city a tourney they began.
7630,XXXII,"There his career exulting many a young warrior ran,"
7631,XXXII,Whom his fresh boiling courage impell'd to honor's field.
7632,XXXII,Many a knight of prowess was there seen under shield.
7633,XXXII,
7634,XXXII,
7635,XXXIII,XXXIII
7636,XXXIII,
7637,XXXIII,Many a stately matron and many a smiling maid
7638,XXXIII,"Sat at the castle windows in costly robes array'd,"
7639,XXXIII,And look'd on while the warriors display'd their skill and force;
7640,XXXIII,The good host with his comrades himself would run a course.
7641,XXXIII,
7642,XXXIII,
7643,XXXIV,XXXIV
7644,XXXIV,
7645,XXXIV,"The time seem'd not to linger, so merrily it pass'd."
7646,XXXIV,Pealing from the minster they heard the bells at last.
7647,XXXIV,Then up were led the palfreys; forth rode each lady bright;
7648,XXXIV,The noble queens were follow'd by many a valiant knight.
7649,XXXIV,
7650,XXXIV,
7651,XXXV,XXXV
7652,XXXV,
7653,XXXV,Down before the minster they lighted on the green.
7654,XXXV,Still to her guests was gracious King Gunther's haughty queen.
7655,XXXV,"Both crown'd, into the minster they stepp'd with royal state."
7656,XXXV,Too soon their love was sunder'd and all through jealous hate!
7657,XXXV,
7658,XXXV,
7659,XXXVI,XXXVI
7660,XXXVI,
7661,XXXVI,"Soon as the mass was over, with regal pomp and pride"
7662,XXXVI,"Thence came they to the palace, and straight exulting hied"
7663,XXXVI,"To the joyous banquet, and neither stop nor stay"
7664,XXXVI,Was put to the high festal until th' eleventh day.
7665,XXXVI,
7666,XXXVI,
7667,XXXVII,XXXVII
7668,XXXVII,
7669,XXXVII,"Then thought Queen Brunhild, ""Silent no longer I'll remain."
7670,XXXVII,"Howe'er to pass I bring it, Kriemhild shall explain,"
7671,XXXVII,"Wherefore so long her husband, who holds of us in fee,"
7672,XXXVII,"Has left undone his service; this sure shall answer'd be."""
7673,XXXVII,
7674,XXXVII,
7675,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
7676,XXXVIII,
7677,XXXVIII,"So still she brooded mischief, and conn'd her devil's lore,"
7678,XXXVIII,Till she broke off in sorrow the feast so blithe before.
7679,XXXVIII,Ever at her heart lay closely what came perforce to light.
7680,XXXVIII,Many a land she startled with horror and affright.

7691,I,
7692,I,One day at th' hour of vespers a loud alarum rose
7693,I,From certain lusty champions that for their pastime chose
7694,I,To prove themselves at tilting in the castle court;
7695,I,Then many a knight and lady ran thither to see the sport.
7696,I,
7697,I,
7698,II,II
7699,II,
7700,II,"There were the proud queens sitting together, as befell,"
7701,II,Each on a good knight thinking that either lov'd full well.
7702,II,"Then thus began fair Kriemhild, ""My husband's of such might,"
7703,II,"That surely o'er these kingdoms he ought to rule by right."""
7704,II,
7705,II,
7706,III,III
7707,III,
7708,III,"Then answer'd Lady Brunhild, ""Nay, how can that be shown?"
7709,III,"Were there none other living but thou and he alone,"
7710,III,"Then might, no doubt, the kingdoms be rul'd by him and thee,"
7711,III,"But, long as Gunther's living, that sure can never be."""
7712,III,
7713,III,
7714,IV,IV
7715,IV,
7716,IV,"Thereto rejoin'd fair Kriemhild, ""See'st thou how proud he stands,"
7717,IV,"How proud he stalks, conspicuous among those warrior bands,"
7718,IV,As doth the moon far-beaming the glimmering stars outshine?
7719,IV,"Sure have I cause to pride me when such a knight is mine."""
7720,IV,
7721,IV,
7722,V,V
7723,V,
7724,V,"Thereto replied Queen Brunhild, ""How brave soe'er he be,"
7725,V,"How stout soe'er or stately, one greater is than he."
7726,V,"Gunther, thy noble brother, a higher place may claim,"
7727,V,"Of knights and kings the foremost in merit and in fame."""

7729,V,
7730,VI,VI
7731,VI,
7732,VI,"Thereto rejoin'd fair Kriemhild, ""So worthy is my mate,"
7733,VI,All praise that I can give him can ne'er be term'd too great.
7734,VI,In all he does how matchless? in honor too how clear!
7735,VI,"Believ'st thou this, Queen Brunhild? at least he's Gunther's peer."""
7736,VI,
7737,VI,
7738,VII,VII
7739,VII,
7740,VII,"""Thou should'st not so perversely, Kriemhild, my meaning take."
7741,VII,"What I said, assure thee, with ample cause I spake."
7742,VII,"I heard them both allow it, then when both first I saw,"
7743,VII,And the stout king in battle compell'd me to his law.
7744,VII,
7745,VII,
7746,VIII,VIII
7747,VIII,
7748,VIII,"""E'en then, when my affection he so knightly won,"
7749,VIII,'Twas fairly own'd by Siegfried that he was Gunther's man.
7750,VIII,"Myself I heard him own it, and such I hold him still."""
7751,VIII,"""Forsooth,"" replied fair Kriemhild, ""they must have used me ill."

7754,IX,IX
7755,IX,
7756,IX,"""How could my noble brethren their power have so applied,"
7757,IX,"As to make me, their sister, a lowly vassal's bride?"
7758,IX,"For manners' sake then, Brunhild, this idle talk give o'er,"
7759,IX,"And, by our common friendship, let me hear no more."""

7762,X,X

7764,X,"""Give o'er will I never,"" the queen replied again;"

7767,X,Into sudden anger at this fair Kriemhild flew.

7770,XI,XI
7771,XI,
7772,XI,"""Ay! but thou must renounce it, for never will he grace"
7773,XI,Thee with his vassal service: he fills a higher place
7774,XI,"Than e'en my brother Gunther, noble though be his strain."
7775,XI,"Henceforth thou should'st be wiser, nor hold such talk again."
7776,XI,
7777,XI,
7778,XII,XII
7779,XII,
7780,XII,"""I wonder, too, since Siegfried thy vassal is by right,"
7781,XII,"Since both of us thou rulest with so much power and might,"
7782,XII,Why to thee his service so long he has denied.
7783,XII,"Nay! I can brook no longer thy insolence and pride."""
7784,XII,
7785,XII,
7786,XIII,XIII
7787,XIII,
7788,XIII,"""Thyself too high thou bearest,"" Brunhild answer made;"
7789,XIII,"""Fain would I see this instant whether to thee be paid"
7790,XIII,"Public respect and honor such as waits on me."""
7791,XIII,Then both the dames with anger lowering you might see.

7793,XIII,
7794,XIV,XIV
7795,XIV,
7796,XIV,"""So shall it be,"" said Kriemhild, ""to meet thee I'm prepar'd"
7797,XIV,"Since thou my noble husband a vassal hast declar'd,"
7798,XIV,"By the men of both our consorts to-day it shall be seen,"
7799,XIV,That I the church dare enter before King Gunther's queen.
7800,XIV,
7801,XIV,
7802,XV,XV
7803,XV,
7804,XV,"""To-day by proof thou'lt witness, what lofty birth is mine,"
7805,XV,And that my noble husband worthier is than thine;
7806,XV,Nor for this with presumption shall I be tax'd I trow;
7807,XV,To-day thou'lt see moreover thy lowly vassal go
7808,XV,
7809,XV,
7810,XVI,XVI
7811,XVI,
7812,XVI,"""To court before the warriors here in Burgundy."
7813,XVI,"Assure thee, thou'lt behold me honor'd more royally"
7814,XVI,"Than the proudest princess that ever here wore crown."""
7815,XVI,The dames their spite attested with many a scowl and frown.
7816,XVI,
7817,XVI,
7818,XVII,XVII
7819,XVII,
7820,XVII,"""Since thou wilt be no vassal,"" Brunhild rejoin'd again,"
7821,XVII,"""Then thou with thy women must apart remain"
7822,XVII,"From my dames and damsels, as to the church we go."""
7823,XVII,"Thereto Kriemhild answer'd, ""Trust me it shall be so."
7824,XVII,
7825,XVII,
7826,XVIII,XVIII
7827,XVIII,
7828,XVIII,"""Array ye now, my maidens,"" said Siegfried's haughty dame,"
7829,XVIII,"""You must not let your mistress here be put to shame."
7830,XVIII,That you have gorgeous raiment make plain to every eye.
7831,XVIII,"What she has just asserted, she soon shall fain deny."""
7832,XVIII,
7833,XVIII,
7834,XIX,XIX
7835,XIX,
7836,XIX,They needed not much bidding; all sought out their best;
7837,XIX,Matrons alike and maidens each donn'd a glittering vest.
7838,XIX,Queen Brunhild with her meiny was now upon her way.
7839,XIX,"By this was deck'd fair Kriemhild in royal rich array,"
7840,XIX,
7841,XIX,
7842,XX,XX
7843,XX,
7844,XX,"With three and forty maidens, whom she to Rhine had brought;"
7845,XX,Bright stuffs were their apparel in far Arabia wrought.
7846,XX,So towards the minster march'd the maidens fair;
7847,XX,All the men of Siegfried were waiting for them there.
7848,XX,
7849,XX,
7850,XXI,XXI
7851,XXI,
7852,XXI,"Strange thought it each beholder, what there by all was seen,"
7853,XXI,"How with their trains far-sunder'd pass'd either noble queen,"
7854,XXI,"Not walking both together as was their wont before,"
7855,XXI,Full many a prowest warrior thereafter rued it sore.
7856,XXI,
7857,XXI,
7858,XXII,XXII
7859,XXII,
7860,XXII,Now before the minster the wife of Gunther stood;
7861,XXII,Meanwhile by way of pastime many a warrior good
7862,XXII,Held light and pleasant converse with many a smiling dame;
7863,XXII,When up the lovely Kriemhild with her radiant meiny came.
7864,XXII,
7865,XXII,
7866,XXIII,XXIII
7867,XXIII,
7868,XXIII,All that the noblest maiden had ever donn'd before
7869,XXIII,Was as wind to the splendor her dazzling ladies wore.
7870,XXIII,"So rich her own apparel in gold and precious things,"
7871,XXIII,She alone might out-glitter the wives of thirty kings.
7872,XXIII,
7873,XXIII,
7874,XXIV,XXIV
7875,XXIV,
7876,XXIV,"Howe'er he might be willing, yet none could dare deny"
7877,XXIV,That such resplendent vesture never met mortal eye
7878,XXIV,As on that fair retinue then sparkled to the sun.
7879,XXIV,"Except to anger Brunhild, Kriemhild had not so done."
7880,XXIV,
7881,XXIV,
7882,XXV,XXV
7883,XXV,
7884,XXV,Both met before the minster in all the people's sight;
7885,XXV,There at once the hostess let out her deadly spite.
7886,XXV,Bitterly and proudly she bade fair Kriemhild stand;
7887,XXV,"""No vassalless precedeth the lady of the land."""

7889,XXV,
7890,XXVI,XXVI
7891,XXVI,
7892,XXVI,"Out then spake fair Kriemhild (full of wrath was she),"
7893,XXVI,"""Could'st thou still be silent, better 'twere for thee."
7894,XXVI,Thou'st made thy beauteous body a dishonor'd thing.
7895,XXVI,"How can a vassal's leman be consort of a king?"""
7896,XXVI,
7897,XXVI,
7898,XXVII,XXVII
7899,XXVII,
7900,XXVII,"""Whom here call'st thou leman?"" said the queen again;"
7901,XXVII,"""So call I thee,"" said Kriemhild; ""thy maidenly disdain"
7902,XXVII,"Yielded first to Siegfried, my husband, Siegmund's son;"
7903,XXVII,Ay! 'was not my brother that first thy favors won.

7905,XXVII,
7906,XXVIII,XXVIII
7907,XXVIII,
7908,XXVIII,"""Why, where were then thy senses? sure 'twas a crafty train,"
7909,XXVIII,"To take a lowly lover, to ease a vassal's pain!"
7910,XXVIII,"Complaints from thee,"" said Kriemhild, ""methinks are much amiss."""
7911,XXVIII,"""Verily,"" said Brunhild, ""Gunther shall hear of this."""

7914,XXIX,XXIX
7915,XXIX,
7916,XXIX,"""And why should that disturb me? thy pride hath thee betray'd."
7917,XXIX,"Why didst thou me, thy equal, with vassalship upbraid?"
7918,XXIX,Know this for sure and certain (to speak it gives me pain)
7919,XXIX,"Never can I meet thee in cordial love again."""
7920,XXIX,
7921,XXIX,
7922,XXX,XXX
7923,XXX,
7924,XXX,Then bitterly wept Brunhild; Kriemhild no longer stay'd;
7925,XXX,Straight with all her followers before the queen she made
7926,XXX,Her way into the minster; then deadly hate 'gan rise;
7927,XXX,And starting tears o'erclouded the shine of brightest eyes.
7928,XXX,
7929,XXX,
7930,XXXI,XXXI
7931,XXXI,
7932,XXXI,"For all the solemn service, for all the chanted song,"
7933,XXXI,Still it seemed to Brunhild they linger'd all too long.
7934,XXXI,Both on her mind and body a load like lead there lay.
7935,XXXI,Many a high-born hero for her sorrow was to pay.
7936,XXXI,
7937,XXXI,
7938,XXXII,XXXII
7939,XXXII,
7940,XXXII,Brunhild stopp'd with her ladies without the minster door.
7941,XXXII,"Thought she, ""This wordy woman shall tell me something more"
7942,XXXII,Of her charge against me spread so loud and rife.

7944,XXXII,
7945,XXXII,
7946,XXXIII,XXXIII
7947,XXXIII,
7948,XXXIII,Now came the noble Kriemhild begirt with many a knight;
7949,XXXIII,"Then spake the noble Brunhild, ""Stop and do me right."
7950,XXXIII,You've voic'd me for a wanton; prove it ere you go.
7951,XXXIII,"You and your foul speeches have wrought me pain and woe."""

7953,XXXIII,
7954,XXXIV,XXXIV
7955,XXXIV,
7956,XXXIV,"Then spake the Lady Kriemhild, ""'Twere wiser to forbear;"
7957,XXXIV,E'en with the gold I'll prove it that on my hand I wear;
7958,XXXIV,"'Twas this that Siegfried brought me from where by you he lay."""
7959,XXXIV,Never liv'd Queen Brunhild so sorrowful a day.

7965,XXXV,And mischievously hidden has since been many a year.
7966,XXXV,"But now I've met with something by which the thief to guess."""
7967,XXXV,Both the dames were frenzied with passion masterless.

7970,XXXVI,XXXVI
7971,XXXVI,
7972,XXXVI,"""Thief?"" made answer Kriemhild, ""I will not brook the name."
7973,XXXVI,"Thou would'st have kept silence, hadst thou a sense of shame."
7974,XXXVI,By the girdle here about me prove full well I can
7975,XXXVI,"That I am ne'er a liar; Siegfried was indeed thy man."""
7976,XXXVI,
7977,XXXVI,
7978,XXXVII,XXXVII
7979,XXXVII,
7980,XXXVII,"'Twas of silk of Nineveh the girdle that she brought,"
7981,XXXVII,With precious stones well garnish'd; a better ne'er was wrought;
7982,XXXVII,"When Brunhild but beheld it, her tears she could not hold."
7983,XXXVII,The tale must needs to Gunther and all his men be told.
7984,XXXVII,

8452,XXXII,Next morning on his journey in haste Sir Siegfried sped.
8453,XXXII,Of his men a thousand merrily he led.
8454,XXXII,He thought his foes to punish who had his friends defied.
8455,XXXII,"Next him rode Sir Hagan, and close his vesture eyed."
8456,XXXII,
8457,XXXII,
8458,XXXIII,XXXIII
8459,XXXIII,
8460,XXXIII,"Soon as the mark he noted, he bade in secret go"
8461,XXXIII,"Two of his men some distance, and come as from the foe,"
8462,XXXIII,"Saying, that only friendship to Burgundy was meant,"
8463,XXXIII,And that they to King Gunther from Ludeger were sent.
8464,XXXIII,
8465,XXXIII,
8466,XXXIV,XXXIV
8467,XXXIV,
8468,XXXIV,"How then it irk'd Sir Siegfried to turn at once the rein,"
8469,XXXIV,Ere he in his friend's quarrel had battled once again!
8470,XXXIV,Scarce could the men of Gunther divert him from his way.
8471,XXXIV,"So to the king back rode he, who thus his thanks 'gan pay."
8472,XXXIV,
8473,XXXIV,
8474,XXXV,XXXV
8475,XXXV,
8476,XXXV,"""Now God requite you, Siegfried, of all my friends the best!"
8477,XXXV,"Since you are always ready to do what I request,"
8478,XXXV,I'll ever do my utmost to merit such good will.
8479,XXXV,"Many are the friends I trust in, but you're the surest still."
8480,XXXV,
8481,XXXV,
8482,XXXVI,XXXVI
8483,XXXVI,
8484,XXXVI,"""Now that we're free from foemen, and in firm peace abide,"
8485,XXXVI,"Hence to the Wask forest a-hunting let us ride,"
8486,XXXVI,"To chase the bears and wild swine, as oft I've done of yore."""
8487,XXXVI,"The faithless, murderous Hagan had counsell'd this before."
8488,XXXVI,
8489,XXXVI,
8490,XXXVII,XXXVII
8491,XXXVII,
8492,XXXVII,"""To all my guests and kinsmen it straight announc'd shall be,"
8493,XXXVII,"I mean to start full early; whoe'er would ride with me,"
8494,XXXVII,"Must forthwith make him ready; whoe'er would here abide,"
8495,XXXVII,"Let him amuse the ladies; with both I'm satisfied."""
8496,XXXVII,
8497,XXXVII,
8498,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
8499,XXXVIII,
8500,XXXVIII,"Then courteously made answer Siegfried the stout and strong,"
8501,XXXVIII,"""If you're inclined for hunting, gladly will I along."
8502,XXXVIII,"So lend me but a huntsman and a good brach or two,"
8503,XXXVIII,"And I into the forest will find my way like you."""
8504,XXXVIII,
8505,XXXVIII,
8506,XXXIX,XXXIX
8507,XXXIX,
8508,XXXIX,"""If one will not suffice you,"" the fraudful king replied,"
8509,XXXIX,"""I'll lend you four good huntsmen, who know the forest wide,"
8510,XXXIX,And every track soever where the wild beasts roam.
8511,XXXIX,"You'll never, with their guidance, come empty-handed home."""

8514,XL,XL
8515,XL,
8516,XL,Thence to his gentle lady rode off the warrior bold.
8517,XL,"Quick to the king had Hagan the baleful tidings told,"
8518,XL,"How he would surely trap him, the champion frank and free."
8519,XL,"Never was such foul treason, nor ever more will be."
8520,XL,
8521,XL,
8522,XLI,XLI
8523,XLI,
8524,XLI,"When now was laid the death-plot by that base traitor pair,"
8525,XLI,The rest then all consented. Gernot and Giselher
8526,XLI,Neither would join the hunting; I know not through what fear
8527,XLI,Or spite they warn'd not Siegfried; soon paid they for it dear.

8538,I,
8539,I,"Gunther and Hagan, the warriors fierce and bold,"
8540,I,"To execute their treason, resolv'd to scour the wold,"
8541,I,"The bear, the boar, the wild bull, by hill or dale or fen,"
8542,I,To hunt with keen-edg'd javelins; what fitter sport for valiant men?
8543,I,
8544,I,
8545,II,II
8546,II,
8547,II,In lordly pomp rode with them Siegfried the champion strong.
8548,II,Good store of costly viands they brought with them along.
8549,II,Anon by a cool runnel he lost his guiltless life.
8550,II,"'Twas so devis'd by Brunhild, King Gunther's moody wife."
8551,II,
8552,II,
8553,III,III
8554,III,
8555,III,But first he sought the chamber where he his lady found.
8556,III,He and his friends already had on the sumpters bound
8557,III,Their gorgeous hunting raiment; they o'er the Rhine would go.
8558,III,Never before was Kriemhild sunk so deep in woe.
8559,III,
8560,III,
8561,IV,IV
8562,IV,
8563,IV,On her mouth of roses he kiss'd his lady dear;
8564,IV,"""God grant me, dame, returning in health to see thee here;"
8565,IV,"So may those eyes see me, too; meanwhile be blithe and gay"
8566,IV,"Among the gentle kinsmen; I must hence away."""
8567,IV,
8568,IV,
8569,V,V
8570,V,
8571,V,Then thought she on the secret (the truth she durst not tell)
8572,V,How she had told it Hagan; then the poor lady fell
8573,V,To wailing and lamenting that ever she was born.
8574,V,"Then wept she without measure, sobbing and sorrow-worn."
8575,V,
8576,V,
8577,VI,VI
8578,VI,
8579,VI,"She thus bespake her husband, ""Give up that chase of thine."
8580,VI,"I dreamt last night of evil, how two fierce forest swine"
8581,VI,Over the heath pursued thee; the flowers turn'd bloody red.
8582,VI,I cannot help thus weeping; I'm chill'd with mortal dread.
8583,VI,
8584,VI,
8585,VII,VII
8586,VII,
8587,VII,"""I fear some secret treason, and cannot lose thee hence,"
8588,VII,Lest malice should be borne thee for misconceiv'd offence.
8589,VII,"Stay, my beloved Siegfried, take not my words amiss."

8594,VIII,
8595,VIII,"""Back shall I be shortly, my own beloved mate."

8597,VIII,I'm well with all thy kinsmen; they're all my firm allies;
8598,VIII,"Nor have I from any e'er deserved otherwise."""

8600,VIII,
8601,IX,IX
8602,IX,
8603,IX,"""Nay! do not, dearest Siegfried! 'tis e'en thy death I dread."
8604,IX,"Last night I dreamt, two mountains fell thundering on thy head,"
8605,IX,"And I no more beheld thee; if thou from me wilt go,"
8606,IX,"My heart will sure be breaking with bitterness of woe."""

8608,IX,
8609,X,X
8610,X,
8611,X,Round her peerless body his clasping arms he threw.
8612,X,"Lovingly he kiss'd her, that faithful wife and true;"
8613,X,"Then took his leave, and parted;--in a moment all was o'er--"
8614,X,"Living, alas poor lady! she saw him never more."
8615,X,
8616,X,
8617,XI,XI
8618,XI,
8619,XI,"Then rode they thence, and hasten'd to a wildering forest drear."
8620,XI,"Many a bold knight, on pastime intent and merry cheer,"
8621,XI,In the train of Gunther and Siegfried took his way.
8622,XI,Stout Gernot and young Giselher at home preferr'd to stay.
8623,XI,
8624,XI,
8625,XII,XII
8626,XII,
8627,XII,"Many a well-laden sumpter before them cross'd the Rhine,"
8628,XII,That for the fellow-hunters carried bread and wine.
8629,XII,"And flesh and fish in plenty, with every dainty thing"
8630,XII,That might become the table of such a mighty king.
8631,XII,
8632,XII,
8633,XIII,XIII
8634,XIII,
8635,XIII,"Their course the noble hunters check'd in an open glade,"
8636,XIII,"Where the wild beasts, that haunted the neighboring greenwood shade,"
8637,XIII,Pass'd to and fro by custom; the hunt they here would hold.
8638,XIII,Thither at length came Siegfried; straight to the king 'twas told.
8639,XIII,
8640,XIII,
8641,XIV,XIV
8642,XIV,
8643,XIV,"Now every path and outlet the huntsmen had beset,"
8644,XIV,When thus bespake Sir Siegfried the chiefs who there were met.
8645,XIV,"""Ye bold and dauntless warriors! who will the honor claim"
8646,XIV,"To enter first the forest, and bring us to the game?"""
8647,XIV,
8648,XIV,
8649,XV,XV
8650,XV,
8651,XV,"""Ere we begin our pastime,"" Sir Hagan straight replied,"
8652,XV,"""Here in this glade together, 'twere better first divide."
8653,XV,"We then shall see more clearly, my lords as well as I,"
8654,XV,Who's the most cunning sportsman of this fair company.
8655,XV,
8656,XV,
8657,XVI,XVI
8658,XVI,
8659,XVI,"""Let us divide among us the huntsmen and the hounds,"
8660,XVI,"Then each, where'er he pleases, beat all these woody bounds,"
8661,XVI,"And who excels his comrades, shall thanks have from the rest."""
8662,XVI,"Not long the hunters linger'd, but started on their quest."
8663,XVI,
8664,XVI,
8665,XVII,XVII
8666,XVII,
8667,XVII,"Then said the good Sir Siegfried, ""I do not need a pack;"
8668,XVII,"One well-train'd hound will serve me the lurking beasts to track,"
8669,XVII,And the close scent to follow through every bush and brake.
8670,XVII,"We'll now begin our hunting."" So Kriemhild's husband spake."
8671,XVII,
8672,XVII,
8673,XVIII,XVIII
8674,XVIII,
8675,XVIII,"With that an aged huntsman a watchful limehound took,"
8676,XVIII,"And shortly brought the champion into a shady nook,"
8677,XVIII,"Where store of beasts were couching; as each sprung from his lair,"
8678,XVIII,"The warriors, like good hunters, fell on and caught them there."
8679,XVIII,
8680,XVIII,
8681,XIX,XIX
8682,XIX,
8683,XIX,"All, that the limehound started, anon with mighty hand"
8684,XIX,"Were slain by noble Siegfried, the Chief of Netherland."
8685,XIX,"No beast could there outrun him, so swift his steed could race;"
8686,XIX,He won from all high praises for mastery in the chase.
8687,XIX,
8688,XIX,
8689,XX,XX
8690,XX,
8691,XX,"Whatever he attempted, he went the best before."
8692,XX,The first beast he encounter'd was a fierce half-bred boar.
8693,XX,Him with a mighty death-stroke he stretch'd upon the ground;
8694,XX,Just after in a thicket a lion huge he found.
8695,XX,
8696,XX,
8697,XXI,XXI
8698,XXI,
8699,XXI,Him the limehound started; his bow Sir Siegfried drew;
8700,XXI,With a keen-headed arrow he shot the lion through.
8701,XXI,But three faint bounds thereafter the dying monster made.
8702,XXI,His wond'ring fellow-huntsmen thanks to Sir Siegfried paid.
8703,XXI,
8704,XXI,
8705,XXII,XXII
8706,XXII,
8707,XXII,"Then one upon another a buffalo, an elk"
8708,XXII,"He slew, four strong ure-oxen, and last a savage shelk."
8709,XXII,"No beast, how swift soever, could leave his steed behind;"
8710,XXII,Scarcely their speed could profit the flying hart or hind.
8711,XXII,
8712,XXII,
8713,XXIII,XXIII
8714,XXIII,
8715,XXIII,Next the sagacious limer a monstrous wild boar trac'd;
8716,XXIII,"Just then the master-hunter came sudden up in haste,"
8717,XXIII,And cross'd his path undaunted as he to fly began.
8718,XXIII,Straight the churning monster at his opponent ran.
8719,XXIII,
8720,XXIII,
8721,XXIV,XXIV
8722,XXIV,
8723,XXIV,"Then forward sprung Sir Siegfried, and with his sword him slew;"
8724,XXIV,"Such feat, I ween, no hunter besides had dared to do."
8725,XXIV,"Then leash'd they the good limehound, and from the thicket led,"
8726,XXIV,And told all the Burgundians how Siegfried's chase had sped.
8727,XXIV,
8728,XXIV,
8729,XXV,XXV
8730,XXV,
8731,XXV,"Then said his merry huntsmen, ""Sir Siegfried, be so kind"
8732,XXV,"As not our wood to empty, but leave some game behind."
8733,XXV,"There'll else be nothing living on mountain or on wold."""
8734,XXV,The champion at their jesting his laughter scarce could hold.
8735,XXV,
8736,XXV,
8737,XXVI,XXVI
8738,XXVI,
8739,XXVI,"They heard then all about them, throughout those forest grounds,"
8740,XXVI,"Such shouting and such baying of huntsmen and of hounds,"
8741,XXVI,That hill and wood re-echoed with the wild uproar.
8742,XXVI,Th' attendants had uncoupled four and twenty dogs or more.
8743,XXVI,
8744,XXVI,
8745,XXVII,XXVII
8746,XXVII,
8747,XXVII,Then full many a monster was doom'd his last to groan.
8748,XXVII,They thought with glad expectance to challenge for their own
8749,XXVII,"The praise for the best hunting; but lower sunk their pride,"
8750,XXVII,When to the tryst-fire shortly they saw Sir Siegfried ride.
8751,XXVII,
8752,XXVII,
8753,XXVIII,XXVIII
8754,XXVIII,
8755,XXVIII,The hunting now was over for the most part at least;
8756,XXVIII,Game was brought in plenty and skins of many a beast
8757,XXVIII,"To the place of meeting, and laid the hearth before."
8758,XXVIII,Ah! to the busy kitchen what full supplies they bore!
8759,XXVIII,
8760,XXVIII,
8761,XXIX,XXIX
8762,XXIX,
8763,XXIX,Then bade Gunther summon the noble hunting crew
8764,XXIX,To the royal breakfast; a horn a huntsman blew
8765,XXIX,"That far and wide re-echoed, and told to all around"
8766,XXIX,That by the tryst-fire ready the king was to be found.
8767,XXIX,
8768,XXIX,
8769,XXX,XXX
8770,XXX,
8771,XXX,"Said one of Siegfried's huntsmen, ""I heard a warning blast,"
8772,XXX,That thrilling horn assures me our hunting time is past;
8773,XXX,"We must back to our fellows; answer it will I."""
8774,XXX,So through the wood resounding rang question and reply.
8775,XXX,
8776,XXX,
8777,XXXI,XXXI
8778,XXXI,
8779,XXXI,"Then spake the good Sir Siegfried, ""Well! let us leave the wood."""
8780,XXXI,"His courser bore him smoothly, fast prick'd his comrades good."
8781,XXXI,"With their noise they rous'd a monster, a wild bear fierce and grim."
8782,XXXI,"Said Siegfried o'er his shoulder to those who follow'd him,"
8783,XXXI,
8784,XXXI,
8785,XXXII,XXXII
8786,XXXII,
8787,XXXII,"""Now, comrades, look for pastime! see you yon thicket there?"
8788,XXXII,Slip the dog directly; I spy a monstrous bear.
8789,XXXII,The same shall instant with us hence to the trysting-place.
8790,XXXII,"To get off in safety swift he indeed must pace."""
8791,XXXII,
8792,XXXII,
8793,XXXIII,XXXIII
8794,XXXIII,
8795,XXXIII,Straight they slipp'd the limer; off leapt the bear with speed;
8796,XXXIII,Sir Siegfried thought to catch him through swiftness of his steed.
8797,XXXIII,"He came on fallen timber, so thus it could not be;"
8798,XXXIII,Then deem'd himself the monster from his fierce hunter free.
8799,XXXIII,
8800,XXXIII,
8801,XXXIV,XXXIV
8802,XXXIV,
8803,XXXIV,"Down sprang from horse Sir Siegfried, and plied on foot the chase;"
8804,XXXIV,Naught then could aid the monster o'ermaster'd in the race.
8805,XXXIV,"Sir Siegfried strongly seized him, and cast a rope around,"
8806,XXXIV,"And, ere he once could wound him, the struggling bear he bound."
8807,XXXIV,
8808,XXXIV,
8809,XXXV,XXXV
8810,XXXV,
8811,XXXV,"So fast the warrior bound him, he could nor scratch nor bite,"
8812,XXXV,"Then tied him to the saddle, and after mounted light."
8813,XXXV,"So to the tryst-fire laughing with his snorting load,"
8814,XXXV,"By way of sport and pastime, the fearless warrior rode."
8815,XXXV,
8816,XXXV,
8817,XXXVI,XXXVI
8818,XXXVI,
8819,XXXVI,In his state how lordly thither he came along!
8820,XXXVI,"Huge was his mighty boar-spear, weighty and broad and strong;"
8821,XXXVI,To his spur descended the good sword that he wore;
8822,XXXVI,Of ruddy gold fair glittering a hunting horn he bore.
8823,XXXVI,
8824,XXXVI,
8825,XXXVII,XXXVII
8826,XXXVII,
8827,XXXVII,Of better hunting-vesture never heard I tell.
8828,XXXVII,His coat of darkest samite became the warrior well.
8829,XXXVII,"His cap of richest sable sat with a careless grace,"
8830,XXXVII,And his death-fraught quiver was bound with many a lace.
8831,XXXVII,
8832,XXXVII,
8833,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
8834,XXXVIII,
8835,XXXVIII,With the skin of a panther the same was cover'd o'er
8836,XXXVIII,"For its balmy sweetness; a strong bow too he bore,"
8837,XXXVIII,"Which none but with a windlass could draw, howe'er he strove,"
8838,XXXVIII,Unless himself was present at the mark to rove.
8839,XXXVIII,
8840,XXXVIII,
8841,XXXIX,XXXIX
8842,XXXIX,
8843,XXXIX,"All his outer garment was of a lynx's hide,"
8844,XXXIX,From head to foot with cunning 'twas speckled all and pied.
8845,XXXIX,On either side descending of the master-hunter bold
8846,XXXIX,From the rich fur there glitter'd many a bright thread of gold.
8847,XXXIX,
8848,XXXIX,
8849,XL,XL
8850,XL,
8851,XL,"Girded he was with Balmung, a broad and mighty blade,"
8852,XL,"With such keen cutting edges, that straight its way it made"
8853,XL,"Where'er it smote on helmet, and thousands did to die."
8854,XL,'Sooth was the lordly hunter of bearing proud and high.
8855,XL,
8856,XL,
8857,XLI,XLI
8858,XLI,
8859,XLI,Besides (of this my story to tell you every part)
8860,XLI,Fraught was his splendid quiver with many a dreary dart;
8861,XLI,"The shaft of each was gilded, a hand's-breadth was the steel."
8862,XLI,'Twas death of those grim arrows a single wound to feel.
8863,XLI,
8864,XLI,
8865,XLII,XLII
8866,XLII,
8867,XLII,So stately from the forest rode on the noble knights;
8868,XLII,"The men of Gunther mark'd him soon as he came in sight,"
8869,XLII,"And ran, and held his courser, and gave him tendance fair."
8870,XLII,Meanwhile close to the saddle lay bound the groaning bear.
8871,XLII,
8872,XLII,
8873,XLIII,XLIII
8874,XLIII,
8875,XLIII,"The knight, from horse alighting, soft the band untied"
8876,XLIII,"That bound his paws and muzzle; straight when the bear they spied,"
8877,XLIII,All the pack of yelpers open'd on him loud.
8878,XLIII,"The beast made for the forest, scattering the startled crowd."
8879,XLIII,
8880,XLIII,
8881,XLIV,XLIV
8882,XLIV,
8883,XLIV,Scared by the din and uproar he through the kitchen rac'd.
8884,XLIV,Ah! how the cooks and scullions from round the fire he chas'd!
8885,XLIV,"Upset were pans and kettles, and store of savory hashes,"
8886,XLIV,"Roast, boil'd, and stew'd together were hissing in the ashes."
8887,XLIV,
8888,XLIV,
8889,XLV,XLV
8890,XLV,
8891,XLV,From their seats upstarted the lords and all the band;
8892,XLV,The bear flew into fury; straight gave the king command
8893,XLV,"The hounds to uncouple, and slip them on the prey."
8894,XLV,"Had it all thus ended, it had been a merry day."
8895,XLV,
8896,XLV,
8897,XLVI,XLVI
8898,XLVI,
8899,XLVI,With bows and mighty boar-spears (no more was quiet there)
8900,XLVI,Upsprung the light-foot warriors and chas'd the flying bear.
8901,XLVI,"The dogs there were so many, none dar'd a dart to fling."
8902,XLVI,With shouting and hallooing they made the mountains ring.
8903,XLVI,
8904,XLVI,
8905,XLVII,XLVII
8906,XLVII,
8907,XLVII,Before the dogs he scamper'd; they follow'd where he led;
8908,XLVII,But 'twas the swift-foot Siegfried that caught him as he fled.
8909,XLVII,Once with his sword he smote him; he wallow'd in his gore.
8910,XLVII,Back to the scatter'd tryst-fire his friends the monster bore.
8911,XLVII,
8912,XLVII,
8913,XLVIII,XLVIII
8914,XLVIII,
8915,XLVIII,Loud shouted each beholder that 'twas a matchless blow.
8916,XLVIII,Now the high-born hunters were bidden to table go.
8917,XLVIII,Down in a flowery meadow sat they right merrily.
8918,XLVIII,Ah! what dainty viands cheer'd that proud company!
8919,XLVIII,
8920,XLVIII,
8921,XLIX,XLIX
8922,XLIX,
8923,XLIX,Still delay'd the attendants the ruddy wine to pour.
8924,XLIX,Never else were warriors better serv'd before.
8925,XLIX,"But for the heinous treason with which they fram'd their plot,"
8926,XLIX,All that choice band of champions were free from blame or blot.
8927,XLIX,
8928,XLIX,
8929,L,L
8930,L,
8931,L,"Then said the noble Siegfried, ""I needs must wonder here,"
8932,L,That joyous wine is wanting with such abundant cheer.
8933,L,"When so o'erflows the kitchen, how is't the cellar's dry?"
8934,L,"Treat merry hunters better, or hunt no more will I."
8935,L,
8936,L,
8937,LI,LI
8938,LI,
8939,LI,"""I have deserv'd in Rhineland more hospitable care."""
8940,LI,Then answering from the table spoke Gunther false and fair.
8941,LI,"""This fault shall soon be mended, and reason done you first."
8942,LI,"For this we may thank Hagan, who makes us die of thirst."""
8943,LI,
8944,LI,
8945,LII,LII
8946,LII,
8947,LII,"Then said the Chief of Trony, ""My lord and master dear,"
8948,LII,"I thought that this day's hunting was not to be held here,"
8949,LII,"But in the wood of Spessart, so thither sent the wine."
8950,LII,"The like shall never happen again by fault of mine."""
8951,LII,
8952,LII,
8953,LIII,LIII
8954,LIII,
8955,LIII,"Then said the Netherlander, ""Little thank I such care."
8956,LIII,I look'd for seven good sumpters to mend our thirsty fare
8957,LIII,"With mead and wine of spices; if so we could not dine,"
8958,LIII,"Better by far have placed us close beside the Rhine."""
8959,LIII,
8960,LIII,
8961,LIV,LIV
8962,LIV,
8963,LIV,"Then spake the Chief of Trony, ""Ye noble knights and bold,"
8964,LIV,I know just to our wishes a runnel clear and cold
8965,LIV,"Close by, so be not angry, but thither let us go."""
8966,LIV,Th' advice brought many a champion sorrow and mortal woe.
8967,LIV,
8968,LIV,
8969,LV,LV
8970,LV,
8971,LV,Yet could not then his danger the death-doom'd hero spy.
8972,LV,Little thought he so foully by seeming friends to die.
8973,LV,"His heart knew naught of falsehood; 'twas open, frank and plain."
8974,LV,For his death dear paid thereafter who fondly hop'd to gain.
8975,LV,
8976,LV,
8977,LVI,LVI
8978,LVI,
8979,LVI,"The noble knight Sir Siegfried with thirst was sore opprest,"
8980,LVI,"So earlier rose from table, and could no longer rest,"
8981,LVI,"But straight would to the mountain the running brook to find,"
8982,LVI,And so advanc'd the treason his faithless foes design'd.
8983,LVI,
8984,LVI,
8985,LVII,LVII
8986,LVII,
8987,LVII,Meanwhile were slowly lifted on many a groaning wain
8988,LVII,The beasts in that wild forest by Siegfried's manhood slain.
8989,LVII,"Each witness gave him honor, and loud his praises spoke."
8990,LVII,Alas! that with him Hagan his faith so foully broke.
8991,LVII,
8992,LVII,
8993,LVIII,LVIII
8994,LVIII,
8995,LVIII,"Now when to the broad linden they all would take their way,"
8996,LVIII,"Thus spake the fraudful Hagan, ""Full oft have I heard say,"
8997,LVIII,"That none a match in swiftness for Kriemhild's lord can be,"
8998,LVIII,"Whene'er to race he pleases; would he grant us this to see?"""
8999,LVIII,
9000,LVIII,
9001,LIX,LIX
9002,LIX,
9003,LIX,"Then spake the Netherlander, Siegfried with open heart,"
9004,LIX,"""Well then! let's make the trial! together we will start"
9005,LIX,"From hence to yonder runnel; let us at once begin,"
9006,LIX,"And he shall pass for winner who shall be seen to win."""
9007,LIX,
9008,LIX,
9009,LX,LX
9010,LX,
9011,LX,"""Agreed!"" said treacherous Hagan, ""let us each other try."""
9012,LX,"Thereto rejoin'd stout Siegfried, ""And if you pass me by,"
9013,LX,"Down at your feet I'll lay me humbled on the grass."""
9014,LX,"When these words heard Gunther, what joy could his surpass?"
9015,LX,
9016,LX,
9017,LXI,LXI
9018,LXI,
9019,LXI,"Then said the fearless champion, ""And this I tell you more,"
9020,LXI,"I'll carry all th' equipment that in the chase I wore,"
9021,LXI,"My spear, my shield, my vesture--leave will I nothing out."""
9022,LXI,His sword then and his quiver he girt him quick about.
9023,LXI,
9024,LXI,
9025,LXII,LXII
9026,LXII,
9027,LXII,King Gunther and Sir Hagan to strip were nothing slow;
9028,LXII,Both for the race stood ready in shirts as white as snow.
9029,LXII,"Long bounds, like two wild panthers, o'er the grass they took,"
9030,LXII,But seen was noble Siegfried before them at the brook.
9031,LXII,
9032,LXII,
9033,LXIII,LXIII
9034,LXIII,
9035,LXIII,"Whate'er he did, the warrior high o'er his fellows soar'd."
9036,LXIII,"Now laid he down his quiver, and quick ungirt his sword."
9037,LXIII,Against the spreading linden he lean'd his mighty spear.
9038,LXIII,So by the brook stood waiting the chief without a peer.
9039,LXIII,
9040,LXIII,
9041,LXIV,LXIV
9042,LXIV,
9043,LXIV,In every lofty virtue none with Sir Siegfried vied.
9044,LXIV,Down he laid his buckler by the water's side.
9045,LXIV,"For all the thirst that parch'd him, one drop he never drank"
9046,LXIV,Till the king had finish'd; he had full evil thank.
9047,LXIV,
9048,LXIV,
9049,LXV,LXV
9050,LXV,
9051,LXV,"Cool was the little runnel, and sparkled clear as glass."
9052,LXV,O'er the rill King Gunther knelt down upon the grass.
9053,LXV,When he his draught had taken he rose and stepp'd aside.
9054,LXV,Full fain alike would Siegfried his thirst have satisfied.
9055,LXV,
9056,LXV,
9057,LXVI,LXVI
9058,LXVI,
9059,LXVI,"Dear paid he for his courtesy; his bow, his matchless blade,"
9060,LXVI,"His weapons all, Sir Hagan far from their lord convey'd,"
9061,LXVI,"Then back sprung to the linden to seize his ashen spear,"
9062,LXVI,And to find out the token survey'd his vesture near;
9063,LXVI,
9064,LXVI,
9065,LXVII,LXVII
9066,LXVII,
9067,LXVII,"Then, as to drink Sir Siegfried down kneeling there he found,"
9068,LXVII,"He pierc'd him through the crosslet, that sudden from the wound"
9069,LXVII,Forth the life-blood spouted e'en o'er his murderer's weed.
9070,LXVII,Never more will warrior dare so foul a deed.
9071,LXVII,
9072,LXVII,
9073,LXVIII,LXVIII
9074,LXVIII,
9075,LXVIII,Between his shoulders sticking he left the deadly spear.
9076,LXVIII,"Never before Sir Hagan so fled for ghastly fear,"
9077,LXVIII,As from the matchless champion whom he had butcher'd there.
9078,LXVIII,"Soon as was Sir Siegfried of the mortal wound aware,"
9079,LXVIII,
9080,LXVIII,
9081,LXIX,LXIX
9082,LXIX,
9083,LXIX,Up he from the runnel started as he were wood.
9084,LXIX,Out from betwixt his shoulders his own huge boar-spear stood.
9085,LXIX,He thought to find his quiver or his broadsword true.
9086,LXIX,The traitor for his treason had then receiv'd his due.
9087,LXIX,
9088,LXIX,
9089,LXX,LXX
9090,LXX,
9091,LXX,"But, ah! the deadly wounded nor sword nor quiver found;"
9092,LXX,His shield alone beside him lay there upon the ground.
9093,LXX,This from the bank he lifted and straight at Hagan ran;
9094,LXX,Him could not then by fleetness escape King Gunther's man.
9095,LXX,
9096,LXX,
9097,LXXI,LXXI
9098,LXXI,
9099,LXXI,"E'en to the death though wounded, he hurl'd it with such power,"
9100,LXXI,That the whirling buckler scatter'd wide a shower
9101,LXXI,"Of the most precious jewels, then straight in shivers broke."
9102,LXXI,Full gladly had the warrior ta'en vengeance with that stroke.
9103,LXXI,
9104,LXXI,
9105,LXXII,LXXII
9106,LXXII,
9107,LXXII,"E'en as it was, his manhood fierce Hagan level'd low."
9108,LXXII,"Loud, all around, the meadow rang with the wondrous blow."
9109,LXXII,"Had he in hand good Balmung, the murderer he had slain."
9110,LXXII,His wound was sore upon him; he writh'd in mortal pain.
9111,LXXII,
9112,LXXII,
9113,LXXIII,LXXIII
9114,LXXIII,
9115,LXXIII,His lively color faded; a cloud came o'er his sight;
9116,LXXIII,He could stand no longer; melted all his might;
9117,LXXIII,In his paling visage the mark of death he bore.
9118,LXXIII,Soon many a lovely lady sorrow'd for him sore.
9119,LXXIII,
9120,LXXIII,
9121,LXXIV,LXXIV
9122,LXXIV,
9123,LXXIV,So the lord of Kriemhild among the flowerets fell.
9124,LXXIV,From the wound fresh gushing his heart's blood fast did well.
9125,LXXIV,"Then thus amidst his tortures, e'en with his failing breath,"
9126,LXXIV,The false friends he upbraided who had contriv'd his death.
9127,LXXIV,
9128,LXXIV,
9129,LXXV,LXXV
9130,LXXV,
9131,LXXV,"Thus spake the deadly wounded, ""Ay! cowards false as hell!"
9132,LXXV,To you I still was faithful; I serv'd you long and well;--
9133,LXXV,"But what boots all?--for guerdon treason and death I've won,"
9134,LXXV,By your friends vile traitors! foully have you done.
9135,LXXV,
9136,LXXV,
9137,LXXVI,LXXVI
9138,LXXVI,
9139,LXXVI,"""Whoever shall hereafter from your loins be born,"
9140,LXXVI,Shall take from such vile fathers a heritage of scorn.
9141,LXXVI,On me you have wreak'd malice where gratitude was due.
9142,LXXVI,"With shame shall you be banish'd by all good knights and true."""
9143,LXXVI,
9144,LXXVI,
9145,LXXVII,LXXVII
9146,LXXVII,
9147,LXXVII,Thither ran all the warriors where in his blood he lay.
9148,LXXVII,To many of that party sure 'twas a joyless day.
9149,LXXVII,"Whoe'er were true and faithful, they sorrow'd for his fall."
9150,LXXVII,So much the peerless champion had merited of all.
9151,LXXVII,
9152,LXXVII,
9153,LXXVIII,LXXVIII
9154,LXXVIII,
9155,LXXVIII,With them the false King Gunther bewept his timeless end.
9156,LXXVIII,"Then spake the deadly wounded, ""Little it boots your friend"
9157,LXXVIII,"Yourself to plot his murder, and then the deed deplore."
9158,LXXVIII,"Such is a shameful sorrow; better at once 'twere o'er."""
9159,LXXVIII,
9160,LXXVIII,
9161,LXXIX,LXXIX
9162,LXXIX,
9163,LXXIX,"Then spake the low'ring Hagan, ""I know not why you moan."
9164,LXXIX,Our cares all and suspicions are now for ever flown.
9165,LXXIX,"Who now are left, against us who'll dare to make defence?"
9166,LXXIX,"Well's me, for all this weeping, that I have rid him hence."""
9167,LXXIX,
9168,LXXIX,
9169,LXXX,LXXX
9170,LXXX,
9171,LXXX,"""Small cause hast thou,"" said Siegfried, ""to glory in my fate."
9172,LXXX,"Had I ween'd, thy friendship cloak'd such murderous hate,"
9173,LXXX,From such as thou full lightly could I have kept my life.
9174,LXXX,"Now grieve I but for Kriemhild, my dear, my widow'd wife."

9181,LXXXI,That by his murderous kinsmen his father thus was slain.

9191,LXXXII,
9192,LXXXII,
9193,LXXXIII,LXXXIII
9194,LXXXIII,
9195,LXXXIII,"Then further spake the dying, and speaking sigh'd full deep,"
9196,LXXXIII,"""Oh king! if thou a promise with anyone wilt keep,"
9197,LXXXIII,Let me in this last moment thy grace and favor find

9210,LXXXV,
9211,LXXXV,"In his mortal anguish he writh'd him to and fro,"

9218,LXXXVI,
9219,LXXXVI,With blood were all bedabbled the flowerets of the field.
9220,LXXXVI,"Some time with death he struggled, as though he scorn'd to yield"
9221,LXXXVI,"E'en to the foe, whose weapon strikes down the loftiest head."
9222,LXXXVI,At last prone in the meadow lay mighty Siegfried dead.

9227,LXXXVII,"When now the chiefs were certain that dead was the good knight,"

9366,XIII,
9367,XIII,
9368,XIV,XIV
9369,XIV,
9370,XIV,"A messenger ran quickly, and came where slept the band"
9371,XIV,Of Siegfried's chosen champions from the Nibelunger's land.
9372,XIV,Their merry cheer his tidings chang'd to sorrow deep.
9373,XIV,His tale they would not credit until they saw him weep.
9374,XIV,
9375,XIV,
9376,XV,XV
9377,XV,
9378,XV,Thence quickly came he running where aged Siegmund lay
9379,XV,From the king's aching eyelids sweet sleep was far away.
9380,XV,"His heart, I ween, foreboded the deed that had been done,"
9381,XV,And that the childless father no more should see his son.
9382,XV,
9383,XV,
9384,XVI,XVI
9385,XVI,
9386,XVI,"""Wake, wake! Sir King! Sir Siegmund! Kriemhild, my lady dear,"
9387,XVI,In haste hath sent me hither; she's plung'd in doleful drear;
9388,XVI,"Woe, that all woe surpasses, wrings her inmost heart."
9389,XVI,"Help her to mourn the misery, whereof you own a part."""
9390,XVI,
9391,XVI,
9392,XVII,XVII
9393,XVII,
9394,XVII,"Then said the king, half-rising, ""What has happ'd of woe"
9395,XVII,"To the fair Lady Kriemhild, which here thou com'st to show?"""
9396,XVII,"""Alas!"" replied he weeping, ""concealment here is vain;"
9397,XVII,"The noble Netherlander, Siegfried, thy son, is slain."""
9398,XVII,
9399,XVII,
9400,XVIII,XVIII
9401,XVIII,
9402,XVIII,"Then said the good King Siegmund, ""Leave off such idle sport;"
9403,XVIII,For my sake spread no further this mischievous report.
9404,XVIII,"Were't true indeed that Siegfried my son were made away,"
9405,XVIII,"Ne'er could I cease from wailing e'en to my dying day."""
9406,XVIII,
9407,XVIII,
9408,XIX,XIX
9409,XIX,
9410,XIX,"""If me you will not credit, but still will doubt my tale,"
9411,XIX,"Hark then yourself to Kriemhild, hear her so wildly wail,"
9412,XIX,"Her and her band of maidens, for noble Siegfried dead."""
9413,XIX,Then sorely shudder'd Siegmund; deep cause had he for dread.
9414,XIX,
9415,XIX,
9416,XX,XX
9417,XX,
9418,XX,"Straight from his bed up sprang he, and his hundred warriors too;"
9419,XX,Their long sharp-edged weapons with hasty hand they drew.
9420,XX,"Where they heard the wailing, headlong they thither ran;"
9421,XX,"Thither too Siegfried's thousand, each a chosen man,"
9422,XX,
9423,XX,
9424,XXI,XXI
9425,XXI,
9426,XXI,"Led by the shrieks of horror, ran with like eager speed."
9427,XXI,"Some of the household fancied, they came for funeral weed."
9428,XXI,"Well might they be confounded, and from their senses start."
9429,XXI,The sting of deadly sorrow was deep in every heart.
9430,XXI,
9431,XXI,
9432,XXII,XXII
9433,XXII,
9434,XXII,"Then said the good King Siegmund, when Kriemhild he had seen,"
9435,XXII,"""Woe worth our journey hither! would it had never been!"
9436,XXII,"'Midst such good friends and kinsmen, who has this murder done,"
9437,XXII,"Which thee hath cost thy husband, and me, alas! my son?"""
9438,XXII,
9439,XXII,
9440,XXIII,XXIII
9441,XXIII,
9442,XXIII,"The noble lady answer'd, ""Could I the murderer find,"
9443,XXIII,"I'd wreak on him such vengeance with all my heart and mind,"
9444,XXIII,"That all his friends should sorrow at the woful tale,"
9445,XXIII,"While they had eyes for weeping, while they had tongues to wail."""
9446,XXIII,
9447,XXIII,
9448,XXIV,XXIV
9449,XXIV,
9450,XXIV,His arms round the dead champion Sir Siegmund trembling threw;
9451,XXIV,"Thereat so loud the sorrow of each beholder grew,"
9452,XXIV,That the proud hall of Gunther and the palace high
9453,XXIV,"And Worms, through all his quarters, rung to the thrilling cry."
9454,XXIV,
9455,XXIV,
9456,XXV,XXV
9457,XXV,
9458,XXV,But none there could bring comfort to Siegfried's lady true.
9459,XXV,"Out from his bloodied vesture his comely limbs they drew,"
9460,XXV,"And wash'd his wound wide-gaping, and laid him on the bier."
9461,XXV,Woe were his weeping followers through heart-consuming drear.
9462,XXV,
9463,XXV,
9464,XXVI,XXVI
9465,XXVI,
9466,XXVI,Out then spake his warriors from the Nibelungers' land;
9467,XXVI,"""Revenge will we our master each with his own good hand"
9468,XXVI,"This very house must harbor him who has done the deed."""
9469,XXVI,Then hasten'd Siegfried's meiny to don their warlike weed.
9470,XXVI,
9471,XXVI,
9472,XXVII,XXVII
9473,XXVII,
9474,XXVII,"Now did the chosen squadron each with his buckler stand,"
9475,XXVII,Eleven hundred champions; at head of all the band
9476,XXVII,Was seen the reverend Siegmund; to faith and honor true
9477,XXVII,Fain would he take vengeance on those who Siegfried slew.
9478,XXVII,
9479,XXVII,
9480,XXVIII,XXVIII
9481,XXVIII,
9482,XXVIII,"With whom they were to battle they could not yet discern,"
9483,XXVIII,"Unless it were with Gunther and his Burgundians stern,"
9484,XXVIII,For with them did Siegfried to the fatal hunting go.
9485,XXVIII,"When Kriemhild saw them weapon'd, 'twas ill on ill, 'twas woe on woe."
9486,XXVIII,
9487,XXVIII,
9488,XXIX,XXIX
9489,XXIX,
9490,XXIX,"However deep her anguish, however great her need,"
9491,XXIX,She fear'd to see her followers the Nibelungers bleed
9492,XXIX,"Beneath her brother's numbers; so, their stout minds to bend,"
9493,XXIX,"She gave them gentle counsel, as friend should deal with friend."
9494,XXIX,
9495,XXIX,
9496,XXX,XXX
9497,XXX,
9498,XXX,"Thus said the mournful lady, ""Siegmund, my lord, give ear."
9499,XXX,What is it you are doing? some rash resolve I fear.
9500,XXX,King Gunther has about him full many a man of might;
9501,XXX,"You and all must perish in such unequal fight."""
9502,XXX,
9503,XXX,
9504,XXXI,XXXI
9505,XXXI,
9506,XXXI,Each had bound on his buckler; each held his sword in hand;
9507,XXXI,They yearn'd for blood and vengeance; with prayer and with command
9508,XXXI,She press'd th' impatient warriors to choose the milder part;
9509,XXXI,They call'd for instant battle; that cut her to the heart.
9510,XXXI,
9511,XXXI,
9512,XXXII,XXXII
9513,XXXII,
9514,XXXII,"She spake, ""My good lord Siegmund, lay thoughts of vengeance by"
9515,XXXII,Till some more fitting season; then with you fain will I
9516,XXXII,Revenge my murder'd husband; could I but come to know
9517,XXXII,"Who has made me thus a widow, woe should be his for woe."
9518,XXXII,
9519,XXXII,
9520,XXXIII,XXXIII
9521,XXXIII,
9522,XXXIII,"""Many are the haughty warriors here on the banks of Rhine,"

9527,XXXIII,
9528,XXXIV,XXXIV
9529,XXXIV,
9530,XXXIV,"""Stay here, and in my sorrow be pleas'd a part to take,"
9531,XXXIV,"Mine and my lord's revengers, till day begin to break,"
9532,XXXIV,"And help me then to coffin my lord who there lies low."""
9533,XXXIV,"Then all the warriors answer'd, ""Dear lady, be it so."""
9534,XXXIV,
9535,XXXIV,
9536,XXXV,XXXV
9537,XXXV,
9538,XXXV,"In sooth it was a wonder that none can tell aright,"
9539,XXXV,"How wept and loud lamented many a dame and many a knight,"
9540,XXXV,That e'en unto the city the rueful wail was borne;
9541,XXXV,In haste the noble burghers came when they heard them mourn.
9542,XXXV,
9543,XXXV,
9544,XXXVI,XXXVI
9545,XXXVI,
9546,XXXVI,"They with the guests lamented, for sore they griev'd as well."
9547,XXXVI,"What was the offence of Siegfried, none of them could tell,"
9548,XXXVI,For which by stroke so sudden the chief had lost his life.
9549,XXXVI,There with the high-born ladies wept each good burgher's wife.
9550,XXXVI,
9551,XXXVI,
9552,XXXVII,XXXVII
9553,XXXVII,
9554,XXXVII,"Joiners and smiths were summon'd to frame a coffin strong,"
9555,XXXVII,"Beset with gold and silver, massy and broad and long,"
9556,XXXVII,And braced with bars of iron to guard the frailer wood.
9557,XXXVII,Then all the crowd about it in dreary sorrow stood.
9558,XXXVII,
9559,XXXVII,
9560,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
9561,XXXVIII,
9562,XXXVIII,And now the night was over; forth peep'd the morning fair;
9563,XXXVIII,Straight bade the noble lady thence to the minster bear
9564,XXXVIII,"The matchless champion Siegfried, her husband lov'd so dear."
9565,XXXVIII,All her friends close follow'd with many a sigh and tear.
9566,XXXVIII,
9567,XXXVIII,
9568,XXXIX,XXXIX
9569,XXXIX,
9570,XXXIX,"When they the minster enter'd, how many a bell was rung!"
9571,XXXIX,How many a priest on all sides the mournful requiem sung!
9572,XXXIX,"Then thither with his meiny came Dankrat's haughty son,"
9573,XXXIX,And thither too grim Hagan; it had been better left undone.
9574,XXXIX,
9575,XXXIX,
9576,XL,XL
9577,XL,
9578,XL,"Then spoke the king, ""Dear sister, woe worth this loss of thine!"

9592,XLII,XLII
9593,XLII,
9594,XLII,"Firmly they made denial; Kriemhild at once replied,"

9600,XLIII,XLIII
9601,XLIII,
9602,XLIII,"It is a mighty marvel, which oft e'en now we spy,"

9604,XLIII,"The wounds break out a-bleeding; then to the same befell,"
9605,XLIII,And thus could each beholder the guilt of Hagan tell.
9606,XLIII,
9607,XLIII,
9608,XLIV,XLIV
9609,XLIV,
9610,XLIV,The wounds at once burst streaming fast as they did before;

9622,XLV,
9623,XLV,
9624,XLVI,XLVI
9625,XLVI,
9626,XLVI,This more distracted Kriemhild; when in her anxious pain
9627,XLVI,"Two friends she saw approaching to seek and mourn the slain,"
9628,XLVI,"Gernot her good brother, and Giselher the young."
9629,XLVI,Their eyes were blind with weeping; true grief their bosoms wrung.

9645,XLVIII,Yet could not they nor others console the widow'd wife.

9647,XLVIII,
9648,XLIX,XLIX
9649,XLIX,
9650,XLIX,His coffin now was ready; it was about midday;
9651,XLIX,From the bier he was lifted whereon till now he lay.
9652,XLIX,Yet would not his pale lady have him laid at once in ground.
9653,XLIX,His friends and faithful followers to further toil were bound.

10276,XXIV,If to and fro each wagon thrice journey'd every day.
10277,XXIV,
10278,XXIV,
10279,XXV,XXV
10280,XXV,
10281,XXV,It was made up of nothing but precious stones and gold;
10282,XXV,"Were all the world bought from it, and down the value told,"
10283,XXV,"Not a mark the less thereafter were left, than erst was scor'd."
10284,XXV,Good reason sure had Hagan to covet such a hoard.
10285,XXV,
10286,XXV,
10287,XXVI,XXVI
10288,XXVI,
10289,XXVI,"And there among was lying the wishing-rod of gold,"
10290,XXVI,"Which whoso could discover, might in subjection hold"
10291,XXVI,"All this wide world as master, with all that dwell therein."
10292,XXVI,There came to Worms with Gernot full many of Albric's kin.
10293,XXVI,
10294,XXVI,
10295,XXVII,XXVII
10296,XXVII,
10297,XXVII,When Gernot and young Giselher had thus possession gain'd
10298,XXVII,"Of that power-giving treasure, the rule they straight obtain'd"
10299,XXVII,Of the country and the castles and many a warlike knight;
10300,XXVII,All was constrained to serve them through terror of their might.
10301,XXVII,
10302,XXVII,
10303,XXVIII,XXVIII
10304,XXVIII,
10305,XXVIII,"When they had brought the treasure thence to King Gunther's land,"
10306,XXVIII,"And had their charge delivered into fair Kriemhild's hand,"
10307,XXVIII,Cramm'd were the towers and chambers wherein the same they stor'd.
10308,XXVIII,Ne'er told was tale of riches to match this boundless hoard.
10309,XXVIII,
10310,XXVIII,
10311,XXIX,XXIX
10312,XXIX,
10313,XXIX,"Yet had she found the treasure a thousand-fold as great,"
10314,XXIX,"Could she have seen but Siegfried restored to life's estate,"
10315,XXIX,"Bare as her hand had Kriemhild preferr'd with him to live,"
10316,XXIX,Renouncing all the puissance which all that hoard could give.
10317,XXIX,
10318,XXIX,
10319,XXX,XXX
10320,XXX,
10321,XXX,"Now she had gain'd possession, so liberal was the dame,"
10322,XXX,That foreign knights unnumber'd into the country came.
10323,XXX,"All prais'd her generous virtues, and own'd they ne'er had seen"
10324,XXX,Lady so open-handed as this fair widow'd queen.
10325,XXX,
10326,XXX,
10327,XXXI,XXXI
10328,XXXI,
10329,XXXI,To rich and poor together began she now to give;
10330,XXXI,"Thereat observed Sir Hagan, ""If she should chance to live"
10331,XXXI,"Some little season longer, so many should we see"
10332,XXXI,"Won over to her service, that ill for us 'twould be."""
10333,XXXI,
10334,XXXI,
10335,XXXII,XXXII
10336,XXXII,
10337,XXXII,"Thereto made answer Gunther, ""The hoard is hers alone;"
10338,XXXII,How can I check her giving? She gives but from her own.
10339,XXXII,Scarce could I gain forgiveness for my offence of old.
10340,XXXII,"I care not how she scatters her jewels and ruddy gold."""
10341,XXXII,
10342,XXXII,
10343,XXXIII,XXXIII
10344,XXXIII,
10345,XXXIII,"""A prudent man,"" said Hagan, ""not for a single hour"
10346,XXXIII,Would such a mass of treasure leave in a woman's power.
10347,XXXIII,She'll hatch with all this largess to her outlandish crew
10348,XXXIII,"Something that hereafter all Burgundy may rue."""
10349,XXXIII,
10350,XXXIII,
10351,XXXIV,XXXIV
10352,XXXIV,
10353,XXXIV,"Thereto replied King Gunther, ""An oath to her I swore,"
10354,XXXIV,That I would ne'er offend her nor harm her any more;
10355,XXXIV,"And I'm resolv'd to keep it; my sister too is she."""
10356,XXXIV,"At once Sir Hagan answer'd, ""Then lay the blame on me."""
10357,XXXIV,
10358,XXXIV,
10359,XXXV,XXXV
10360,XXXV,
10361,XXXV,Too many of the chieftains their plighted faith forsook;
10362,XXXV,The powerful hoard the perjur'd from the poor widow took;
10363,XXXV,Sir Hagan straight made seizure at once of every key.
10364,XXXV,"When her brother Gernot heard it, bitterly wroth was he."
10365,XXXV,
10366,XXXV,
10367,XXXVI,XXXVI
10368,XXXVI,
10369,XXXVI,"Then spake the young Sir Giselher, ""Hagan the fierce and rude"
10370,XXXVI,Hath foully wrong'd my sister; this I should have withstood;
10371,XXXVI,"But that he is my kinsman, it should cost his life."""
10372,XXXVI,Then afresh all vainly wept noble Siegfried's wife.
10373,XXXVI,
10374,XXXVI,
10375,XXXVII,XXXVII
10376,XXXVII,
10377,XXXVII,"Then said the good Sir Gernot, ""Ere this pernicious mine"
10378,XXXVII,"Confound us any further, better beneath the Rhine"
10379,XXXVII,"Sink it altogether, and tell no mortal where."""
10380,XXXVII,Then sadly went fair Kriemhild to her brother Giselher.
10381,XXXVII,
10382,XXXVII,
10383,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
10384,XXXVIII,
10385,XXXVIII,"She wept and said, ""Dear brother, pray take some thought of me;"
10386,XXXVIII,"Of my person and possessions thou should'st the guardian be."""
10387,XXXVIII,"Then spake he to his sister, ""I will, whate'er betide,"
10388,XXXVIII,"Soon as we come back hither, for now we hence must ride."""
10389,XXXVIII,
10390,XXXVIII,
10391,XXXIX,XXXIX
10392,XXXIX,
10393,XXXIX,King Gunther and his kinsmen they forthwith left the land.
10394,XXXIX,The very best among them he took to form his band.
10395,XXXIX,There stay'd behind but Hagan; fierce hate and malice still
10396,XXXIX,"He bore the weeping Kriemhild, and sought to work her ill."
10397,XXXIX,
10398,XXXIX,
10399,XL,XL
10400,XL,
10401,XL,"Ere back the king came thither, impatient of delay"
10402,XL,"Hagan seiz'd the treasure, and bore it thence away."
10403,XL,Into the Rhine at Lochheim the whole at once threw he!
10404,XL,"Henceforth he thought t' enjoy it, but that was ne'er to be."
10405,XL,
10406,XL,
10407,XLI,XLI
10408,XLI,
10409,XLI,He never more could get it for all his vain desire;
10410,XLI,So fortune of the traitor cheats of his treason's hire.
10411,XLI,"Alone he hop'd to use it as long as he should live,"
10412,XLI,"But neither himself could profit, nor to another give."
10413,XLI,
10414,XLI,
10415,XLII,XLII
10416,XLII,
10417,XLII,"Once more return'd the princess, and with them all their train."
10418,XLII,Forthwith began sad Kriemhild her heavy loss to plain
10419,XLII,With ladies and with maidens; their grief indeed was strong.
10420,XLII,In all good faith was Giselher ready to venge her wrong.
10421,XLII,
10422,XLII,
10423,XLIII,XLIII
10424,XLIII,
10425,XLIII,"Then said they altogether, ""Much evil hath he done."""
10426,XLIII,"So for a time Sir Hagan retir'd their wrath to shun,"
10427,XLIII,Till he regain'd their favor; at last they look'd it o'er.
10428,XLIII,Thereat to him fair Kriemhild yet deadlier hatred bore.
10429,XLIII,
10430,XLIII,
10431,XLIV,XLIV
10432,XLIV,
10433,XLIV,"Ere thus the Knight of Trony had hidd'n the wondrous hoard,"
10434,XLIV,They all an oath together had sworn with one accord
10435,XLIV,"To keep it in concealment while one of them should live,"
10436,XLIV,"So none himself could take it, nor to another give."

10438,XLIV,
10439,XLV,XLV
10440,XLV,
10441,XLV,"With this new weight of anguish surcharg'd was Kriemhild left,"
10442,XLV,"Of her bold husband widow'd, and of the hoard bereft"
10443,XLV,"By such o'erweening outrage; in tears the mourner lay,"
10444,XLV,Nor ever ceas'd to sorrow e'en till her dying day.
10445,XLV,
10446,XLV,
10447,XLVI,XLVI
10448,XLVI,
10449,XLVI,From the death of Siegfried for thirteen years she dwelt
10450,XLVI,"On her wrongs ever brooding, nor joy one moment felt."
10451,XLVI,The murder of her husband she could not once forget.
10452,XLVI,To him she still was faithful; that praise is Kriemhild's yet.
10453,XLVI,
10454,XLVI,
10455,XLVII,XLVII
10456,XLVII,
10457,XLVII,"The wealthy Lady Uta, when death took Dankrat hence,"
10458,XLVII,"A sumptuous monastery rais'd at her own expense,"
10459,XLVII,"Endowed with rich revenues, which yet its coffers fill;"
10460,XLVII,The abbey of Lorsch they call it; 'tis high in honor still.

10462,XLVII,
10463,XLVIII,XLVIII
10464,XLVIII,
10465,XLVIII,Thereto the mourning Kriemhild no little part supplied
10466,XLVIII,Both for the soul of Siegfried and for all souls beside.
10467,XLVIII,"She gave both gold and jewels; a wife more chaste and true,"
10468,XLVIII,And a more liberal giver man surely never knew.
10469,XLVIII,
10470,XLVIII,
10471,XLIX,XLIX
10472,XLIX,
10473,XLIX,"Since Kriemhild had King Gunther once to her grace restor'd,"
10474,XLIX,"And yet by his connivance next lost the precious hoard,"
10475,XLIX,A thousand-fold more sorrow at her heart there lay.
10476,XLIX,The proud and high-born lady would gladly thence away.
10477,XLIX,

10479,L,L
10480,L,
10481,L,Meanwhile for Lady Uta was built with skill and care
10482,L,"At Lorsch, fast by her abbey, a sumptuous palace fair."
10483,L,"The widow left her children, and there seclusion found."
10484,L,Still lies she in her coffin deep in that hollow'd ground.
10485,L,
10486,L,
10487,LI,LI
10488,LI,
10489,LI,"Then said the queen to Kriemhild, ""List to me, daughter dear,"

10491,LI,"And dwell with me thy mother, and cease to weep and grieve."""
10492,LI,"""To whom then,"" answer'd Kriemhild, ""Shall I my husband leave?"""
10493,LI,
10494,LI,
10495,LII,LII
10496,LII,
10497,LII,"The Lady Uta answer'd, ""Here let him still abide."""
10498,LII,"""Now God in heaven forbid it!"" the faithful wife replied;"
10499,LII,"""No! my beloved mother, I must not have it so;"

10505,LIII,Then gave command the mourner up to take the dead;
10506,LIII,His noble bones were forthwith transferred to their last bed
10507,LIII,At Lorsch beside the minster in many-honor'd guise.

10714,XXIV,The chiefs that came from Hungary how gladly she survey'd!
10715,XXIV,Then thus with smiling aspect spake the noble maid.
10716,XXIV,
10717,XXIV,
10718,XXV,XXV
10719,XXV,
10720,XXV,"""Welcome home, dear father, welcome thy comrades too!"""
10721,XXV,"Fair thanks were paid the damsel by all that knightly crew,"
10722,XXV,"As them and her befitted, for her reception kind."
10723,XXV,Well to Lady Gotelind was known her husband's mind.
10724,XXV,
10725,XXV,
10726,XXVI,XXVI
10727,XXVI,
10728,XXVI,"As by the side of Rudeger that night awake she lay,"
10729,XXVI,"Thus in soft accents asking the margravine 'gan say,"
10730,XXVI,"""Whither have you been order'd by the King of Hungary?"""
10731,XXVI,"Said he, ""My Lady Gotelind, I'll tell you willingly."

10734,XXVII,XXVII
10735,XXVII,
10736,XXVII,"""Our king again would marry now that fair Helca's dead,"
10737,XXVII,And I must go a-wooing in royal Etzel's stead.
10738,XXVII,To ask the hand of Kriemhild hence to the Rhine I ride.
10739,XXVII,"Here will she rule as lady with queenly power and pride."""

10745,XXVIII,We hear her praise and honor by every tongue confess'd.
10746,XXVIII,She'll be to us hereafter what Helca was whilere.
10747,XXVIII,"We the proud crown of Hungary may gladly see her wear."""

10749,XXVIII,
10750,XXIX,XXIX
10751,XXIX,
10752,XXIX,"Then said the noble margrave, ""Love and lady mine,"

10768,XXXI,Ah! what rich stuffs the warriors then from her chamber bore!
10769,XXXI,"'Mong the good knights were mantles shar'd out in copious store,"
10770,XXXI,Each with the patient needle well sewn from throat to spur.
10771,XXXI,Therefrom whatever pleas'd him chose out Sir Rudeger.

10776,XXXII,'Twas on the seventh fair morning that from Bechlaren rode
10777,XXXII,The host and his companions; they through Bavaria yode
10778,XXXII,"With store of arms and raiment, yet such was their array,"
10779,XXXII,That robbers rarely ventur'd to assail them on their way.
10780,XXXII,
10781,XXXII,
10782,XXXIII,XXXIII
10783,XXXIII,
10784,XXXIII,Within twelve days of journey by Rhine they drew the rein.
10785,XXXIII,The news of their arrival no secret could remain.
10786,XXXIII,"To the king and his liegemen at once the tidings ran,"
10787,XXXIII,"That come were certain strangers; the host to ask began,"

10789,XXXIII,
10790,XXXIV,XXXIV
10791,XXXIV,
10792,XXXIV,"If they were known to any; who knew, should say so straight"
10793,XXXIV,'Twas seen their sturdy sumpters bore many a heavy weight;
10794,XXXIV,"So, that they were wealthy, each took at once for known."
10795,XXXIV,Forthwith were they to chambers in the wide city shown.
10796,XXXIV,
10797,XXXIV,
10798,XXXV,XXXV
10799,XXXV,
10800,XXXV,"Since no man knew the strangers who to the land were come,"
10801,XXXV,Narrowly was each chieftain observ'd by all and some.
10802,XXXV,"They wonder'd wherefore came they, and from what distant coast."
10803,XXXV,The same of stout Sir Hagan inquir'd the anxious host.

10808,XXXVI,"Then said the Knight of Trony, ""I have not seen them yet;"
10809,XXXVI,I can inform you better when I and they have met.
10810,XXXVI,"Whatever be their country, how far soe'er it be,"
10811,XXXVI,"They must indeed be strangers, if they're unknown to me."""

10816,XXXVII,Now were in fitting chambers bestow'd the noble guests.
10817,XXXVII,"The margrave and his comrades all donn'd their choicest vests,"
10818,XXXVII,And rode to court attended; all gaz'd on them their fill;

10822,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
10823,XXXVIII,
10824,XXXVIII,"Straight cried the nimble Hagan, ""If I conjecture right,"
10825,XXXVIII,"(Though now 'tis many a summer since last I saw the knight),"
10826,XXXVIII,"So moves yon gallant squadron, that we must needs have here"
10827,XXXVIII,"The mighty Hunnish margrave redoubted Rudeger."""

10832,XXXIX,"""Nay! how can I believe it,"" said Gunther instantly,"
10833,XXXIX,"""That he of Bechlaren has come to Burgundy?"""
10834,XXXIX,"The king had scarce well ended, when they had drawn so nigh,"
10835,XXXIX,That Hagan could for certain good Rudeger descry.

10839,XL,
10840,XL,"He and his friends ran forward, and flock'd the guests around."
10841,XL,Five hundred knights together sprung from horse to ground.
10842,XL,The valiant chiefs of Hungary were welcom'd o'er and o'er.
10843,XL,Messengers yet never such goodly raiment wore.

10845,XL,
10846,XLI,XLI

10850,XLI,"The Lord of Bechlaren and his followers bold."""
10851,XLI,The warlike Huns were greeted with honors manifold.

10855,XLII,
10856,XLII,King Gunther's nearest kinsmen to see them forward press'd.
10857,XLII,"Ortwine of Metz thus friendly Sir Rudeger address'd,"

10861,XLII,
10862,XLIII,XLIII
10863,XLIII,
10864,XLIII,Much thanks for their fair welcome return'd the warriors all.
10865,XLIII,"Thence forthwith stepp'd they forward into the spacious hall,"
10866,XLIII,Where the king was seated amidst his chivalry.
10867,XLIII,"He rose as in they enter'd, such was his courtesy."

10873,XLIV,Gunther and Gernot welcom'd with friendly warm intent
10874,XLIV,"Their guest and his companions, and made them fitting cheer."

10878,XLV,XLV
10879,XLV,
10880,XLV,To the seat he brought him whereon himself he sat.

11141,LXXVII,
11142,LXXVIII,LXXVIII
11143,LXXVIII,
11144,LXXVIII,Yet could not all persuasion the faithful mourner bring
11145,LXXVIII,"To choose a second lover, and yield unto the king."
11146,LXXVIII,"Then begg'd the noble warriors, ""If nothing more can be,"
11147,LXXVIII,"Consent at least a moment the messengers to see."""

11151,LXXIX,
11152,LXXIX,"""I'll not deny,"" soft sighing the noble dame replied,"
11153,LXXIX,"""But that I'd fain see Rudeger renown'd so far and wide"
11154,LXXIX,For all his many virtues: 'tis due to him alone;

11160,LXXX,"""So beg him,"" said she further, ""to let me see him here"
11161,LXXX,In my bower to-morrow; then I'll acquaint his ear
11162,LXXX,"Myself with all my wishes and tell him all my tale."""
11163,LXXX,Then bitterly began she once more to weep and wail.

11166,LXXXI,LXXXI
11167,LXXXI,
11168,LXXXI,"Nothing the noble Rudeger had more desir'd, I ween,"
11169,LXXXI,Than to obtain an audience of that fair widow'd queen.

11174,LXXXII,LXXXII
11175,LXXXII,
11176,LXXXII,"So early on the morrow, about the matin song,"
11177,LXXXII,Forth came the noble envoys; there was a mighty throng;
11178,LXXXII,"To court with the good margrave there went a gorgeous crowd,"
11179,LXXXII,"In glittering weed accoutred, of high-born knights and proud."

11183,LXXXIII,
11184,LXXXIII,"Kriemhild, the fair, the spotless, amidst her ladies stood,"
11185,LXXXIII,Waiting for Sir Rudeger the noble envoy good.
11186,LXXXIII,He found her in the vesture that every day she wore;
11187,LXXXIII,Her dames stood by in raiment all work'd and broider'd o'er.

11189,LXXXIII,
11190,LXXXIV,LXXXIV
11191,LXXXIV,
11192,LXXXIV,"To the door to meet him with stately step she went,"
11193,LXXXIV,And well and warmly welcom'd the chief from Etzel sent.
11194,LXXXIV,"Eleven good knights were with him, himself the twelfth was there."
11195,LXXXIV,Ne'er came such high-born suitors to woo a queen so fair.

11197,LXXXIV,
11198,LXXXV,LXXXV
11199,LXXXV,
11200,LXXXV,"They bade the chief be seated, and with him all his band."
11201,LXXXV,"There the two noble margraves were seen before her stand,"
11202,LXXXV,Eckewart and Gary; none there was blithe or glad;
11203,LXXXV,"All wore one face of mourning, e'en as their lady sad."

11207,LXXXVI,
11208,LXXXVI,"Before her meekly seated many a fair maid was seen,"
11209,LXXXVI,Pale sorrowful companions of that woe-wither'd queen.
11210,LXXXVI,"The cloth, that veil'd her bosom, with scalding tears was wet."
11211,LXXXVI,"Well saw the noble margrave, her grief was lively yet."

11213,LXXXVI,
11214,LXXXVII,LXXXVII
11215,LXXXVII,
11216,LXXXVII,"Then spake the high-born envoy, ""Fair child of mightiest kings,"

11226,LXXXVIII,"To hear you, honored margrave! You are an envoy good."""
11227,LXXXVIII,Thereby her firm reluctance the rest well understood.

11230,LXXXIX,LXXXIX
11231,LXXXIX,
11232,LXXXIX,"Then the Prince of Bechlaren, Sir Rudeger, thus spake,"

11384,CVIII,Just at mass time returning the kings her brethren came;

11400,CX,These press'd their noble leader ever by the way

11406,CXI,CXI

11563,CXXX,But the tale of this huge treasure to th' ear of Hagan came.
11564,CXXX,
11565,CXXX,
11566,CXXXI,CXXXI
11567,CXXXI,
11568,CXXXI,"Said he, ""She'll ne'er forgive me, that need I not be told;"
11569,CXXXI,So safe with us Burgundians shall stay Sir Siegfried's gold.
11570,CXXXI,Why should I let such treasure to deadly foes accrue?
11571,CXXXI,I know full well what Kriemhild with all this wealth will do.
11572,CXXXI,
11573,CXXXI,
11574,CXXXII,CXXXII
11575,CXXXII,
11576,CXXXII,"""If once she hence could fetch it, I guess her whole intent;"
11577,CXXXII,"I doubt not, every farthing would to my hurt be spent."
11578,CXXXII,"Besides, they have not horses such weight to undergo;"
11579,CXXXII,"So Hagan here will keep it, and that shall Kriemhild know."""
11580,CXXXII,
11581,CXXXII,
11582,CXXXIII,CXXXIII
11583,CXXXIII,
11584,CXXXIII,"When she heard the tidings, she felt it grievous bale;"
11585,CXXXIII,To the three kings together full soon was told the tale.
11586,CXXXIII,"They wish'd they could avert it, but nothing hence ensued."
11587,CXXXIII,Then thus the noble Rudeger spoke in right merry mood.
11588,CXXXIII,
11589,CXXXIII,
11590,CXXXIV,CXXXIV
11591,CXXXIV,
11592,CXXXIV,"""Rich and noble princess, why sorrow for the gold?"
11593,CXXXIV,"Let but the eyes of Etzel your peerless fair behold,"
11594,CXXXIV,So much the king adores you (for this on me depend)
11595,CXXXIV,"He'll give you far more treasure than you can ever spend."""
11596,CXXXIV,
11597,CXXXIV,
11598,CXXXV,CXXXV
11599,CXXXV,
11600,CXXXV,"Thereto the queen made answer, ""Right noble Rudeger,"
11601,CXXXV,"More wealth had never princess in kingdom far or near,"
11602,CXXXV,"Than this outrageous Hagan has foully reft from me."""
11603,CXXXV,Then came her brother Gernot to her chamber hastily.
11604,CXXXV,
11605,CXXXV,
11606,CXXXVI,CXXXVI
11607,CXXXVI,
11608,CXXXVI,The king's key in a moment he dash'd into the door.
11609,CXXXVI,"The gold of Lady Kriemhild, thirty thousand marks or more,"
11610,CXXXVI,Out was laid in order from the secret cell.
11611,CXXXVI,He bade the strangers take it; that pleas'd King Gunther well.
11612,CXXXVI,
11613,CXXXVI,
11614,CXXXVII,CXXXVII
11615,CXXXVII,
11616,CXXXVII,"Then he of Bechlaren, fair Gotelind's husband, spake:"
11617,CXXXVII,"""If my Lady Kriemhild had power with her to take"
11618,CXXXVII,"All that from Nibelung's country was ever brought to Rhine,"
11619,CXXXVII,Yet touch'd should it be never by her hand or by mine.
11620,CXXXVII,
11621,CXXXVII,
11622,CXXXVIII,CXXXVIII
11623,CXXXVIII,
11624,CXXXVIII,"""So let it here be treasur'd, for none of it will I."
11625,CXXXVIII,"From home I have hither brought such a large supply,"
11626,CXXXVIII,"That on the road full lightly we can with this dispense,"
11627,CXXXVIII,"So amply are we furnish'd for all the journey hence."""
11628,CXXXVIII,
11629,CXXXVIII,
11630,CXXXIX,CXXXIX
11631,CXXXIX,
11632,CXXXIX,"Twelve chests of gold, the choicest that e'er was seen of eye,"
11633,CXXXIX,Her maidens had kept ever in close reserve laid by.
11634,CXXXIX,"Now with them, as they parted, they took the precious load,"
11635,CXXXIX,"With store of women's trinkets, to serve them on the road."
11636,CXXXIX,
11637,CXXXIX,
11638,CXL,CXL
11639,CXL,
11640,CXL,Still she look'd for violence from Hagan bad and bold.
11641,CXL,She had yet for pious uses a thousand marks of gold.
11642,CXL,"These for the soul of Siegfried, her dearest lord, she gave."
11643,CXL,"""Her love,"" thought noble Rudeger, ""lives e'en beyond the grave."""
11644,CXL,
11645,CXL,
11646,CXLI,CXLI
11647,CXLI,
11648,CXLI,"Then spake again the mourner: ""Where are my friends,"" said she,"
11649,CXLI,"""Who will a life of exile endure for love of me?"
11650,CXLI,They with the banish'd widow to Hungary must ride;
11651,CXLI,"Let them take of my treasures, and clothes and steeds provide."""
11652,CXLI,
11653,CXLI,
11654,CXLII,CXLII
11655,CXLII,
11656,CXLII,"Then spake to the sad princess the Margrave Eckewart,"
11657,CXLII,"""Since of your royal household first I form'd a part,"
11658,CXLII,"I've done you loyal service; this can I truly say,"
11659,CXLII,And will the like do ever e'en to my dying day.
11660,CXLII,
11661,CXLII,
11662,CXLIII,CXLIII
11663,CXLIII,
11664,CXLIII,"""Of my men, too, five hundred to guard you I will lead,"
11665,CXLIII,"All at your disposal, faithful and good at need."
11666,CXLIII,"Us from the side of Kriemhild death alone shall part."""
11667,CXLIII,She bow'd to him in silence; his words went to her heart.
11668,CXLIII,
11669,CXLIII,
11670,CXLIV,CXLIV
11671,CXLIV,
11672,CXLIV,Then forth were led their horses; start must they presently;
11673,CXLIV,There all around them flocking their friends wept bitterly.
11674,CXLIV,Surely did wealthy Uta with her fair maidens show
11675,CXLIV,How deeply they lamented that Kriemhild was to go.
11676,CXLIV,
11677,CXLIV,
11678,CXLV,CXLV
11679,CXLV,
11680,CXLV,"A hundred high-born damsels begirt the parting queen,"
11681,CXLV,"All clad, as well became them, in robes of glittering sheen."
11682,CXLV,Full many a tear of sorrow from their bright eyes was shed.
11683,CXLV,At Etzel's court soon after a joyous life they led.
11684,CXLV,
11685,CXLV,
11686,CXLVI,CXLVI
11687,CXLVI,
11688,CXLVI,Then in place young Giselher and Gernot you might view;
11689,CXLVI,"They came, through love to Kriemhild, with all their followers true."
11690,CXLVI,"On her way the brethren to bring their sister sought,"
11691,CXLVI,And with them well accoutred a thousand warriors brought.
11692,CXLVI,
11693,CXLVI,
11694,CXLVII,CXLVII
11695,CXLVII,
11696,CXLVII,"Then came the active Gary, Ortwine was present too,"
11697,CXLVII,And there the steward Rumold his duty had to do.
11698,CXLVII,These found them fitting quarters e'en to the Danube's shore.
11699,CXLVII,"A little from the city rode Gunther, and no more."

11701,CXLVII,
11702,CXLVIII,CXLVIII
11703,CXLVIII,
11704,CXLVIII,"Ere from the Rhine for ever their eastward steps they bent,"
11705,CXLVIII,"They to the Huns beforehand swift messengers had sent,"
11706,CXLVIII,"To tell the stout King Etzel what Rudeger had done,"
11707,CXLVIII,And how he peerless Kriemhild for his lord had woo'd and won.
11708,CXLVIII,
11709,CXLVIII,
11710,CXLIX,CXLIX
11711,CXLIX,
11712,CXLIX,The messengers spurr'd hotly; no time had they to lose;
11713,CXLIX,They rode at once for honor and the guerdon of good news.
11714,CXLIX,"When home they brought the tidings, and all the truth made clear,"
11715,CXLIX,Word surely never sounded so sweet in Etzel's ear.
11716,CXLIX,
11717,CXLIX,
11718,CL,CL
11719,CL,
11720,CL,For joy of such fair tidings the king was pleas'd to give
11721,CL,"The messengers such presents, that thenceforth each might live"
11722,CL,"Merrily for ever, e'en to his dying day."
11723,CL,Through love the king's long sorrow vanish'd at once away.

11760,IV,That day a loving farewell 'twixt Kriemhild's friends was seen
11761,IV,And the good margrave's vassals; they thence asunder sped.
11762,IV,The high-born queen right onward many a fair maiden led.

11783,VII,There sat in Passau city a bishop of good report.
11784,VII,"Straight empty was each chamber, and eke the prince's court."
11785,VII,"All were forthwith pricking to Bavarian ground,"
11786,VII,Where the good Bishop Pilgrin the Lady Kriemhild found.

11818,XI,"His knights await our coming, and think us close at hand."""

11822,XII,
11823,XII,Already had fair Gotelind the joyful tidings heard;
11824,XII,She and her noble daughter quick themselves bestirr'd.
11825,XII,"She had been advis'd by Rudeger, her lord and master dear,"
11826,XII,"It seem'd him right and fitting, that, the sad queen to cheer,"

11829,XIII,XIII
11830,XIII,
11831,XIII,"She should ride and meet her with his vassals every one,"
11832,XIII,"Up to the Ems advancing. This was no sooner done,"

11834,XIII,The roads throughout the country were alive with horse and man.

11836,XIII,
11837,XIV,XIV
11838,XIV,
11839,XIV,To Efferding fair Kriemhild had now her journey made;
11840,XIV,Many a Bavarian pricker his hands had gladly laid
11841,XIV,"On the costly baggage as is their custom still,"
11842,XIV,"And thus the noble travellers would have suffer'd loss and ill,"
11843,XIV,
11844,XIV,
11845,XV,XV
11846,XV,
11847,XV,But those light-finger'd rovers the margrave could not brook.
11848,XV,A thousand knights and better to guard his march he took;
11849,XV,"Thither, too, his consort fair Gotelind had come,"
11850,XV,And in bright array around her his vassals all and some.

11852,XV,
11853,XVI,XVI
11854,XVI,
11855,XVI,"Thence o'er the Traun they hasten'd, and forthwith all around"
11856,XVI,With tents and huts bespotted the plain of Ems they found.
11857,XVI,There the noble travellers that night their lodging made.
11858,XVI,The bands of knights their charges by Rudeger were paid.
11859,XVI,
11860,XVI,
11861,XVII,XVII
11862,XVII,
11863,XVII,No longer in her quarters fair Gotelind abode;
11864,XVII,"Many a wanton palfrey pranc'd in the crowded road,"
11865,XVII,"Every bridle jingling, and glittering every selle."
11866,XVII,Right hearty was the welcome; it pleas'd the margrave well.

11869,XVIII,XVIII
11870,XVIII,
11871,XVIII,Now on both sides advancing the gorgeous trains drew near.
11872,XVIII,"Many a good knight between them forth prick'd in full career,"
11873,XVIII,"And waged the mimic battle; their knightly sports, I ween,"
11874,XVIII,"Drew many a damsel's glances, nor irk'd the stately queen."

11881,XIX,From the hands of heroes in knightly exercise.
11882,XIX,Well before the ladies rode they for the prize.

11887,XX,"Soon was o'er the tourney; the knights together sped,"
11888,XX,"Each friendly greeting other; then Gotelind forth was led,"
11889,XX,Her duty to Queen Kriemhild in humble guise to pay.
11890,XX,"The skill'd in ladies' service, scant leisure sure had they."

11896,XXI,"Not ill pleas'd was surely the noble margravine,"
11897,XXI,That back from Rhine so hearty had come her own good knight.
11898,XXI,Her long-brooded sorrows vanish'd in delight.
11899,XXI,

11901,XXII,XXII
11902,XXII,
11903,XXII,"When now had pass'd the welcome the loving pair between,"
11904,XXII,He bade her with her ladies alight upon the green.
11905,XXII,None then was idle standing among the nobles there;
11906,XXII,All busily bestirr'd them in the service of the fair.
11907,XXII,
11908,XXII,
11909,XXIII,XXIII
11910,XXIII,
11911,XXIII,Soon as the Lady Kriemhild beheld the margravine
11912,XXIII,"There with the ladies standing, rode on a space the queen;"
11913,XXIII,Then sudden check'd her palfrey (the bit he answer'd well)
11914,XXIII,And instant bade her servants lift her down from selle.
11915,XXIII,
11916,XXIII,
11917,XXIV,XXIV
11918,XXIV,
11919,XXIV,"Then might you see the bishop, already sprung from steed,"
11920,XXIV,"Him and good Sir Eckewart, his niece to Gotelind lead."
11921,XXIV,All there made way before them as softly on they came.
11922,XXIV,Then on the mouth the wanderer kiss'd the good margrave's dame.
11923,XXIV,
11924,XXIV,
11925,XXV,XXV
11926,XXV,
11927,XXV,"Then said the wife of Rudeger, with tender love and true,"
11928,XXV,"""Now well is me, dear lady, that one so fair as you"
11929,XXV,Here at last in our country I with my eyes have seen.

11934,XXVI,
11935,XXVI,"""Now heaven you quit,"" said Kriemhild, ""for all that you have done."

11937,XXVI,"You may indeed be thankful that you have look'd on me."""
11938,XXVI,'Twas all unknown to either what after was to be.

11940,XXVI,
11941,XXVII,XXVII
11942,XXVII,
11943,XXVII,Courteously one to another went many a blooming maid;
11944,XXVII,Young knights to yield them service with ready zeal essay'd;
11945,XXVII,So after kindly greeting (though erst unknown I ween)
11946,XXVII,They soon came friends together close sitting on the green.
11947,XXVII,
11948,XXVII,
11949,XXVIII,XXVIII
11950,XXVIII,
11951,XXVIII,With wine were serv'd the ladies; by this 'twas height of noon;
11952,XXVIII,The noble knights and damsels again were moving soon.
11953,XXVIII,"Thence rode they to a meadow where spacious tents were pight,"
11954,XXVIII,And all within made ready for solace and delight.

11956,XXVIII,
11957,XXIX,XXIX
11958,XXIX,
11959,XXIX,There through the dark they rested till morn began to smile.
11960,XXIX,"They of Bechlaren bestirr'd themselves the while,"
11961,XXIX,For such guests and so many fittingly to prepare.
11962,XXIX,"The margrave so had order'd, little was wanting there."

11981,XXXII,XXXII
11982,XXXII,
11983,XXXII,"So either party mingled, and each went hand in hand"

11991,XXXIII,What further pass'd among them is more than I can say.
11992,XXXIII,"Sore murmur'd Kriemhild's followers that they must hence away,"
11993,XXXIII,And leave the pleasant city where such kind friends abode.

12013,XXXVI,XXXVI
12014,XXXVI,
12015,XXXVI,"In turn, as well befitted her state and lofty line,"
12016,XXXVI,"So well Dame Gotelind treated the strangers from the Rhine,"

12174,VIII,Duke Ramung of Wallachia rode trampling o'er the plain;
12175,VIII,Seven hundred chosen warriors behind him held the rein;
12176,VIII,You might see them speeding like wild birds in their flight.

12184,IX,After their country's fashion they shouted shrill and loud.

12190,X,"Hawart was there of Denmark (a champion bold was he),"

12199,XI,Thither too from Hungary rode on with thousands three
12200,XI,"Sir Bloedel, Etzel's brother, for knightly deeds renown'd;"
12201,XI,He mov'd with princely splendor to where the queen he found.
12202,XI,
12203,XI,
12204,XII,XII
12205,XII,
12206,XII,Last the great King Etzel and eke Sir Dietrich came
12207,XII,With all his brave companions; there many a knight of fame
12208,XII,"And proud descent was present, prudent, and bold, and true,"
12209,XII,High beat the heart of Kriemhild their wide array to view.
12210,XII,
12211,XII,
12212,XIII,XIII
12213,XIII,
12214,XIII,Then to the queen beside him thus spoke Sir Rudeger;
12215,XIII,"""Lady, with your permission the king I'll welcome here."
12216,XIII,"Whome'er to kiss I bid you, let it straight be done."
12217,XIII,"It fits not, such a favor be granted every one."""

12220,XIV,XIV
12221,XIV,
12222,XIV,Straight from her sleek palfrey the queen was lifted down;
12223,XIV,"No longer dallied Etzel, the king of wide renown;"
12224,XIV,"From horse with many a warrior he lighted on the green,"
12225,XIV,And merrily went forward to meet the noble queen.
12226,XIV,
12227,XIV,
12228,XV,XV
12229,XV,
12230,XV,"Two great and mighty princes, as has to us been told,"
12231,XV,"Advanc'd with the fair lady in raiment rich with gold,"
12232,XV,"As the wide-ruling Etzel approached his bride to meet,"
12233,XV,When she deign'd the monarch with a loving kiss to greet.
12234,XV,
12235,XV,
12236,XVI,XVI
12237,XVI,
12238,XVI,With that her veil back threw she; forth beam'd her rosy hue
12239,XVI,From the gold around it; many were there to view;
12240,XVI,All own'd Dame Helca's beauty scarce with hers could vie.
12241,XVI,There the king's brother Bloedel close was standing by.
12242,XVI,
12243,XVI,
12244,XVII,XVII
12245,XVII,
12246,XVII,"Him the first kiss'd Kriemhild as bade the margrave good,"
12247,XVII,And next to him King Gibek; there too Sir Dietrich stood.
12248,XVII,"Twelve, the chief and noblest, were kiss'd by Etzel's bride."
12249,XVII,With courteous grace she welcom'd many a good knight beside.
12250,XVII,
12251,XVII,
12252,XVIII,XVIII
12253,XVIII,
12254,XVIII,"All the while that Etzel talk'd with his lady true,"
12255,XVIII,The young knights were doing as young knights now will do.
12256,XVIII,"They tried their skill in tilting as best they could devise,"
12257,XVIII,Christian alike and heathen each in his country's guise.
12258,XVIII,
12259,XVIII,
12260,XIX,XIX
12261,XIX,
12262,XIX,In Dietrich's men bold bearing and knightly you might spy.
12263,XIX,How high above the bucklers they made the splinters fly
12264,XIX,(So mighty was their puissance) and deafen'd all the field!
12265,XIX,By the German strangers pierc'd through was many a shield.

12267,XIX,
12268,XX,XX
12269,XX,
12270,XX,The crash of spears resounded as band encounter'd band.
12271,XX,"Thither were come from all sides the warriors of the land,"
12272,XX,"And the king's guests together, nobles in proud array;"
12273,XX,Thence now with Lady Kriemhild King Etzel went his way.
12274,XX,
12275,XX,
12276,XXI,XXI
12277,XXI,
12278,XXI,"Close by, a rich pavilion for their retreat they found;"
12279,XXI,Crowded with tents and cabins was all the field around.
12280,XXI,"There, after all their labors, their languid limbs they laid."
12281,XXI,"Many a good warrior thither led many a gentle maid,"
12282,XXI,
12283,XXI,
12284,XXII,XXII
12285,XXII,
12286,XXII,Where on a cushion'd sofa rich beyond compare
12287,XXII,The stately queen was seated: the margrave's anxious care
12288,XXII,"For all things most convenient to pomp and ease had sent,"
12289,XXII,"And so at once serv'd Kriemhild, and gave the king content."
12290,XXII,
12291,XXII,
12292,XXIII,XXIII
12293,XXIII,
12294,XXIII,The tale then told by Etzel is more than I can say;
12295,XXIII,Soft in his hand reposing her snowy fingers lay.
12296,XXIII,"So sat they gentle toying, for Rudeger, I ween,"
12297,XXIII,Left not the king a moment in secret with the queen.
12298,XXIII,
12299,XXIII,
12300,XXIV,XXIV
12301,XXIV,
12302,XXIV,Then o'er the spacious meadow they bade the tourney cease;
12303,XXIV,With honor all that tumult now was hush'd in peace.
12304,XXIV,"Then Etzel's men betook them to cabin, booth, or tent;"
12305,XXIV,Fit and convenient harbor they found where'er they went.
12306,XXIV,
12307,XXIV,
12308,XXV,XXV
12309,XXV,
12310,XXV,"The day at last was ended, then took they their repose,"
12311,XXV,"Till, at her hour returning, the cheerful dawn arose."
12312,XXV,Then hasten'd many a warrior to horse at once to spring.
12313,XXV,Ah! what pastimes plied they in honor of the king!
12314,XXV,
12315,XXV,
12316,XXVI,XXVI
12317,XXVI,
12318,XXVI,The king his Huns exhorted to do as honor bade.
12319,XXVI,From Tulna to Vienna their journey then they made.
12320,XXVI,There found they many a lady adorn'd in all her pride
12321,XXVI,To welcome with due honor King Etzel's noble bride.
12322,XXVI,
12323,XXVI,
12324,XXVII,XXVII
12325,XXVII,
12326,XXVII,"In overflowing fulness all, that could each delight,"
12327,XXVII,To his wish was ready; exulting many a knight
12328,XXVII,Look'd forward to the revels; joy smil'd on most and least;
12329,XXVII,With mirth and gladness open'd King Etzel's marriage-feast.
12330,XXVII,
12331,XXVII,
12332,XXVIII,XXVIII
12333,XXVIII,
12334,XXVIII,"The numbers now assembled the city could not hold,"
12335,XXVIII,"So all, who were not strangers, the noble margrave told"
12336,XXVIII,To seek convenient quarters in all the country round.
12337,XXVIII,Still constant in attendance on the fair queen were found
12338,XXVIII,
12339,XXVIII,
12340,XXIX,XXIX
12341,XXIX,
12342,XXIX,"The valiant chief, Sir Dietrich, and many a knight besides;"
12343,XXIX,Needful rest and solace each himself denied
12344,XXIX,To cheer the noble strangers and give them full content.
12345,XXIX,Sir Rudeger and his comrades had heartiest merriment.

12349,XXX,
12350,XXX,Held was the marriage festal on a Whitsuntide;
12351,XXX,'Twas then that royal Etzel embrac'd his high-born bride
12352,XXX,"In the city of Vienna; I ween she ne'er had found,"
12353,XXX,"When first she wed, such myriads all to her service bound."
12354,XXX,
12355,XXX,
12356,XXXI,XXXI
12357,XXXI,
12358,XXXI,With gifts she made acquaintance of those she ne'er had seen;

12360,XXXI,"She had lost, we thought, the treasures that she before had won;"

12363,XXXI,
12364,XXXII,XXXII
12365,XXXII,
12366,XXXII,For seventeen days did Etzel his marriage festal hold;
12367,XXXII,"Never to us of monarch, I ween, before was told,"
12368,XXXII,"Who so proudly feasted, in old or modern lore."
12369,XXXII,"The guests, who there were present, all their new raiment wore."

12371,XXXII,
12372,XXXIII,XXXIII
12373,XXXIII,
12374,XXXIII,"Of old, I ween, in Netherland she ne'er at board had sat"
12375,XXXIII,With such a host of warriors; well can I vouch for that;
12376,XXXIII,"For ne'er so many champions had Siegfried at command,"
12377,XXXIII,"With all his wealth, as Kriemhild saw before Etzel stand."
12378,XXXIII,
12379,XXXIII,
12380,XXXIV,XXXIV
12381,XXXIV,
12382,XXXIV,"Never king before him so many mantles brave,"
12383,XXXIV,"For length and breadth conspicuous, at his own wedding gave,"
12384,XXXIV,"Nor such store of rich vesture, enough for each to take;"
12385,XXXIV,All this was freely lavish'd for lovely Kriemhild's sake.
12386,XXXIV,
12387,XXXIV,
12388,XXXV,XXXV
12389,XXXV,
12390,XXXV,There of a mind together were friends and strangers too;
12391,XXXV,Neither their goods nor chattels kept that free-handed crew.
12392,XXXV,"Whatever was ask'd, was granted; they gave till they were bare."
12393,XXXV,"Many a one, through kindness, not a coat had left to wear."
12394,XXXV,
12395,XXXV,
12396,XXXVI,XXXVI
12397,XXXVI,
12398,XXXVI,"How once by Rhine she tarried, the bride a moment thought,"
12399,XXXVI,With her first noble husband; to her eyes the tears it brought;
12400,XXXVI,"Yet she so well conceal'd it, the feasters mark'd her not;"
12401,XXXVI,"Now, after all her sorrows, what glory was her lot!"
12402,XXXVI,
12403,XXXVI,
12404,XXXVII,XXXVII
12405,XXXVII,
12406,XXXVII,"All was but a trifle, that by the rest was done,"
12407,XXXVII,To the liberal deeds of Dietrich; whatever Botlung's son
12408,XXXVII,"In former days had giv'n him, went scatter'd through the land;"
12409,XXXVII,Marvels too of bounty were wrought by Rudeger's hand.

12411,XXXVII,
12412,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
12413,XXXVIII,
12414,XXXVIII,"Prince Bloedel, too, of Hungary vied nobly with the best;"
12415,XXXVIII,He bade his comrades empty full many a travelling chest
12416,XXXVIII,Cramm'd with gold and silver; the whole was giv'n away;
12417,XXXVIII,The warriors of King Etzel a merry life led they.

12421,XXXIX,
12422,XXXIX,"Werbel as well as Swemmeline, the minstrels of the king,"

12424,XXXIX,"They gain'd, I ween, in largess a thousand marks or more,"

12923,XIV,
12924,XIV,"It chanced that there were many, who were right well content"

12949,XVII,"They met right courteous greeting from knights on every side,"
12950,XVII,Such as in distant countries to noble guests is due.
12951,XVII,Werbel there found with Gunther many a champion bold and true.

13884,XLIX,Nothing leads men to ruin like hankering after pelf.
13885,XLIX,He thought by ferrying Hagan his ruddy gold to get;

13929,LV,LV
13930,LV,
13931,LV,"With the word up caught he an oar both broad and long,"
13932,LV,"And lent the knight a buffet so sturdy and so strong,"
13933,LV,That in the boat he brought him at once upon his knee.
13934,LV,Such a boisterous boatman never before met he.

13937,LVI,LVI
13938,LVI,

13940,LVI,"So on the head of Hagan a boat-pole next he broke,"
13941,LVI,"The ferryman of Elsy was sure a lusty wight,"
13942,LVI,Yet naught but loss and ruin got he by all his might.

13944,LVI,
13945,LVII,LVII
13946,LVII,
13947,LVII,The grim knight up starting ended soon the fray;
13948,LVII,To the sheath quick gripp'd he wherein his weapon lay.
13949,LVII,"Off he his head has smitten, and to the bottom thrown."
13950,LVII,Soon were the glad tidings to the bold Burgundians known.

13955,LVIII,"The boat meanwhile, ere Hagan its master yet had slain,"

13961,LIX,LIX
13962,LIX,
13963,LIX,"The brawny stranger turn'd it with many a sturdy stroke,"
13964,LIX,Till in his grasp o'ermaster'd the oar asunder broke.
13965,LIX,"He long'd to reach his comrades at a near landing-place,"
13966,LIX,"But oar had ne'er another, so this he join'd apace."

13971,LX,"With a shield-thong together (poor cord, but workman good!)"
13972,LX,And then adown the river made for a neighboring wood.
13973,LX,There his good lords the warrior found waiting on the strand;

13978,LXI,
13979,LXI,"Him well his comrades greeted beside the foamy flood,"
13980,LXI,But when they saw the shallop reeking all with blood
13981,LXI,"From that grim wound, that sudden the ferryman did to death,"
13982,LXI,They put a thousand questions to Hagan in a breath.

13985,LXII,LXII
13986,LXII,
13987,LXII,"When beheld King Gunther the hot blood, how it ran"

13997,LXIII,I have seen no boatman; this I can truly say;

14018,XLVI,
14019,XLVI,"To make their passage quicker, the horses in a throng"
14020,XLVI,"They drove into the river; these swam so well and strong,"
14021,XLVI,That by the forceful current the warriors lost not one;
14022,XLVI,A few down lower landed with weary toil foredone.

14024,XLVI,
14025,LXVII,LXVII
14026,LXVII,
14027,LXVII,Long and broad and massy was that huge ferry-boat.
14028,LXVII,Five hundred men and better it all at once could float
14029,LXVII,With their food and weapons from sounding shore to shore.
14030,LXVII,That day many a good warrior perforce strain'd at the oar.

14034,LXVIII,
14035,LXVIII,Aboard then plac'd the heroes their gold and eke their weed.
14036,LXVIII,The goal of dark destruction they sought with fatal speed.
14037,LXVIII,Hagan was master-boatman; his luckless skill alone
14038,LXVIII,Full many a gallant champion brought to that land unknown.

14044,LXIX,Thereto his own stout followers; behind still tarried more.
14045,LXIX,Nine thousand lusty varlets he after brought away.

14050,LXX,
14051,LXX,"As the good knight thus deftly was putting o'er his freight,"
14052,LXX,He thought on the strange warning he had receiv'd so late
14053,LXX,From those wise river-ladies with their prophetic breath;
14054,LXX,It brought King Gunther's chaplain within a hair of death.

14072,LXXII,
14073,LXXIII,LXXIII
14074,LXXIII,

14851,XX,Many a good knight was breathing for her the secret sigh;
14852,XX,In truth she well deserv'd it; her thoughts were pure and high.

14860,XXI,Soon show'd the noble minstrel what love the host he bore.
14861,XXI,
14862,XXI,
14863,XXII,XXII
14864,XXII,
14865,XXII,"And now at last they sever'd, as custom there requir'd;"
14866,XXII,"Ladies and knights, as fitted, to separate rooms retir'd."
14867,XXII,In the broad hall the tables in order straight were set;
14868,XXII,There soon the noble strangers all lordly service met.

14870,XXII,
14871,XXIII,XXIII
14872,XXIII,
14873,XXIII,"To grace her guests, at table the noble hostess kind"

14877,XXIII,
14878,XXIII,
14879,XXIV,XXIV
14880,XXIV,
14881,XXIV,With meats and drinks abundant their fill had feasted all;
14882,XXIV,Then back the lovely ladies were usher'd to the hall;
14883,XXIV,"Nor comely mirth there wanted, nor merriment, nor jest."
14884,XXIV,The gentle knight Sir Folker there shone above the rest.
14885,XXIV,
14886,XXIV,
14887,XXV,XXV
14888,XXV,
14889,XXV,"Then out spake to Sir Rudeger that minstrel bold and true,"
14890,XXV,"""High and puissant margrave, God sure has dealt with you"
14891,XXV,"As one whom most He favors, since he so fair a wife"

14908,XXVII,"And can give her nothing; what boots then all her fair?"""

14931,XXX,"Soon so the chiefs contriv'd it, that Giselher, nothing loth,"

14934,XXX,
14935,XXXI,XXXI
14936,XXXI,
14937,XXXI,"When once a thing is settled, who further can gainsay?"
14938,XXXI,Forthwith they bade the damsel to court to take her way.
14939,XXXI,"Then for his wife to give him the lovely maid they swore,"
14940,XXXI,Then he too vow'd to cherish and love her evermore.

14942,XXXI,
14943,XXXII,XXXII
14944,XXXII,
14945,XXXII,Next dower'd was the fair maiden with castles and with land;
14946,XXXII,"With an oath assurance was giv'n by Gunther's hand,"
14947,XXXII,"As well as by Lord Gernot's, that so it should be done."
14948,XXXII,"Then said the noble margrave, ""Since castles I have none,"

14957,XXXIII,
14958,XXXIII,
14959,XXXIV,XXXIV
14960,XXXIV,
14961,XXXIV,"Then had the bride and bridegroom within a ring to stand,"
14962,XXXIV,For such was then the custom; a merry stripling band
14963,XXXIV,"Encircled the fair couple, and gaz'd on them their fill,"
14964,XXXIV,And thought the while as idly as think young people still.
14965,XXXIV,
14966,XXXIV,
14967,XXXV,XXXV
14968,XXXV,
14969,XXXV,"Now when was ask'd the damsel in homely phrase and plain,"
14970,XXXV,"If she would have the warrior, she felt a moment's pain;"
14971,XXXV,Not that she was unwilling to take the stately one;
14972,XXXV,"She blush'd but at the question, as many a maid has done."

14979,XXXVI,"Young Giselher around her, the shrinking and the coy,"
14980,XXXVI,Lock'd his white hands together; alas! how fleeting was their joy!

14982,XXXVI,
14983,XXXVII,XXXVII
14984,XXXVII,
14985,XXXVII,"Then spake again the margrave, ""Ye rich and noble kings,"

14990,XXXVII,
14991,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
14992,XXXVIII,
14993,XXXVIII,The merry sound of revel was hush'd perforce at last.
14994,XXXVIII,"With mincing step the maidens forth to their chambers pass'd,"
14995,XXXVIII,And eke in rest the strangers slept on till break of day.

15032,XLIII,
15033,XLIII,This now could last no longer; thence must they forward fare.
15034,XLIII,Little his custom'd bounty did then the margrave spare.
15035,XLIII,All then was had for asking; that morn denied was none;
15036,XLIII,All kindness and all honor to every guest was done.
15037,XLIII,
15038,XLIII,
15039,XLIV,XLIV
15040,XLIV,
15041,XLIV,And now their noble meiny brought up before the gate
15042,XLIV,Store of good chargers saddled; thither to swell their state
15043,XLIV,"Flock'd troops of foreign champions, all bearing shield in hand,"
15044,XLIV,All with the Rhenish brethren bound to King Etzel's land.
15045,XLIV,
15046,XLIV,
15047,XLV,XLV
15048,XLV,
15049,XLV,The noble host in plenty proffer'd his gifts to all
15050,XLV,Before the noble strangers came outside the hall.
15051,XLV,"With open hand liv'd Rudeger, stout heart, and honor clear;"
15052,XLV,He now his lovely daughter had given to Giselher.
15053,XLV,
15054,XLV,
15055,XLVI,XLVI
15056,XLVI,
15057,XLVI,"Then gave he valiant Gernot a sword full sharp and bright,"
15058,XLVI,Which soon the bold Burgundian bore manfully in fight.
15059,XLVI,"That so her husband gave it, well pleased the margrave's wife."
15060,XLVI,Alas! the fatal present cost Rudeger his life.
15061,XLVI,
15062,XLVI,
15063,XLVII,XLVII
15064,XLVII,
15065,XLVII,Then to the great King Gunther he gave from out his store
15066,XLVII,"A mailcoat, that with honor the sturdy champion wore."
15067,XLVII,"But seldom could the monarch to take a present brook,"
15068,XLVII,Yet at the hand of Rudeger this with warm thanks he took.
15069,XLVII,
15070,XLVII,
15071,XLVIII,XLVIII
15072,XLVIII,
15073,XLVIII,"Then Gotelind, as was fitting, offer'd with fair accord"
15074,XLVIII,"A parting gift to Hagan, that, like the king his lord,"
15075,XLVIII,"He, too, not empty-handed, to Etzel court might ride,"
15076,XLVIII,"But he declin'd the present, and to the dame replied,"
15077,XLVIII,
15078,XLVIII,
15079,XLIX,XLIX
15080,XLIX,
15081,XLIX,"""I ne'er saw ought, fair lady, however rich and rare,"
15082,XLIX,"That it would more content me hence as my own to bear,"
15083,XLIX,Than yonder well-form'd buckler that hangs on yonder wall.
15084,XLIX,"To take that shield to Hungary would please me most of all."""
15085,XLIX,
15086,XLIX,
15087,L,L
15088,L,
15089,L,"Soon as the Lady Gotelind heard Hagan's accents deep,"
15090,L,They brought to mind her sorrow; she could not choose but weep.
15091,L,"Then thought she on bold Nudung, by mightier Wittich slain,"
15092,L,And to her wounded bosom the smart return'd again.
15093,L,
15094,L,
15095,LI,LI
15096,LI,
15097,LI,"Thus she bespake Sir Hagan, ""That shield I freely give,"
15098,LI,"And would to God the warrior among us still did live,"
15099,LI,Who bore it erst in battle; dead on the field he lay;
15100,LI,"Him must I weep for ever, mourning my life away."""
15101,LI,
15102,LI,
15103,LII,LII
15104,LII,
15105,LII,Then from her seat she totter'd; her limbs with anguish shook;
15106,LII,"The shield of her lamented in her white hands she took,"
15107,LII,"And carried it to Hagan; he grasp'd the gift she gave,"
15108,LII,"Giv'n and receiv'd in honor, and fitting well the brave."
15109,LII,
15110,LII,
15111,LIII,LIII
15112,LIII,
15113,LIII,A veil of glittering samite its varied hues conceal'd;
15114,LIII,Never had the daylight shone on a better shield.
15115,LIII,With precious stones far-beaming 'twas richly deck'd all o'er.
15116,LIII,It could not have been purchas'd for a thousand marks or more.
15117,LIII,
15118,LIII,
15119,LIV,LIV
15120,LIV,
15121,LIV,So by command of Hagan the shield away was ta'en.
15122,LIV,Then came to court Sir Dankwart among the parting train.
15123,LIV,"To him gave Rudeger's daughter robes richly broider'd o'er,"
15124,LIV,Which 'midst the Huns thereafter in joyous mood he wore.
15125,LIV,
15126,LIV,
15127,LV,LV
15128,LV,
15129,LV,"Of all the gifts that morning bestow'd on every guest,"
15130,LV,"Not one by those Burgundians had ever been possess'd,"
15131,LV,"But by the margrave's bounty, which so by proof they knew."
15132,LV,"Soon they became such foemen, that they the giver slew."
15133,LV,
15134,LV,
15135,LVI,LVI
15136,LVI,
15137,LVI,And now the valiant Folker with high-bred courtly grace
15138,LVI,"Stepp'd forth before Dame Gotelind, and, standing there in place,"
15139,LVI,"His sweetest tones attemper'd and sang his choicest lay,"
15140,LVI,Ere he from Bechlaren took leave and went his way.
15141,LVI,
15142,LVI,
15143,LVII,LVII
15144,LVII,
15145,LVII,With that the gentle hostess bade bring a casket near
15146,LVII,(Of friendly gifts and bounty and kindness you must hear);
15147,LVII,"From this she took twelve bracelets, and drew them o'er his hand;"
15148,LVII,"""These you must take, and with you bear hence to Etzel's land,"
15149,LVII,
15150,LVII,
15151,LVIII,LVIII
15152,LVIII,
15153,LVIII,"""And for the sake of Gotelind the same at court must wear,"
15154,LVIII,"That I may learn, when hither again you all repair,"
15155,LVIII,"What service you have done me in yon assembly bright."""
15156,LVIII,The lady's wish thereafter full well perform'd the knight.
15157,LVIII,
15158,LVIII,
15159,LIX,LIX
15160,LIX,
15161,LIX,"Then the noble margrave his parting guests bespake,"
15162,LIX,"""That you may ride the safer, myself the charge will take"
15163,LIX,"To guide you, lest from robbers you suffer by the road."""
15164,LIX,With that upon his sumpters in haste was laid their load.
15165,LIX,
15166,LIX,
15167,LX,LX
15168,LX,
15169,LX,The host he soon was ready with full five hundred men
15170,LX,Well horsed and well apparell'd; them led he merrily then
15171,LX,"To the proud feast of Etzel, and they him follow'd fain;"
15172,LX,Not one of them came living to Bechlaren back again.
15173,LX,
15174,LX,
15175,LXI,LXI
15176,LXI,
15177,LXI,The host from home departed with many a loving kiss:
15178,LXI,The like did also Giselher; his honor counsell'd this.
15179,LXI,Each to his beating bosom his trembling lady press'd.
15180,LXI,That parting planted sorrow in many a virgin breast.
15181,LXI,
15182,LXI,
15183,LXII,LXII
15184,LXII,
15185,LXII,All windows in Bechlaren now flew open wide.
15186,LXII,"Straight would to horse the margrave, and with his warriors ride"
15187,LXII,"I ween, their hearts that moment their coming doom forbode."
15188,LXII,Many a dame and many a damsel loud sobb'd as forth they rode.
15189,LXII,
15190,LXII,
15191,LXIII,LXIII
15192,LXIII,
15193,LXIII,"E'en for their best beloved in heart they sorrow'd sore,"
15194,LXIII,"For those, whom at Bechlaren they were to see no more."
15195,LXIII,Yet merrily the champions prick'd along the strand
15196,LXIII,Downward beside the Danube to reach the Hunnish land.
15197,LXIII,
15198,LXIII,
15199,LXIV,LXIV
15200,LXIV,
15201,LXIV,Then thus to the Burgundians out spake the stately knight.
15202,LXIV,"""Rudeger the noble, methinks, it were but right"
15203,LXIV,We should announce we're coming e'en now to Hunnish ground;
15204,LXIV,"More pleasantly no tidings in Etzel's ear will sound."""
15205,LXIV,
15206,LXIV,
15207,LXV,LXV
15208,LXV,
15209,LXV,Straight adown through Austria he bade a courier ride;
15210,LXV,"At once among the people 'twas publish'd far and wide,"
15211,LXV,That coming were the heroes from Worms beyond the Rhine.
15212,LXV,"Right glad were Etzel's vassals, and those of Etzel's line."
15213,LXV,
15214,LXV,
15215,LXVI,LXVI
15216,LXVI,
15217,LXVI,"With the news the couriers forth gallop'd hastily,"
15218,LXVI,That the Nibelungers were now in Hungary.
15219,LXVI,"""Well should'st thou receive them, Kriemhild, lady mine!"
15220,LXVI,"They come to do thee honor, these brethren dear of thine."""
15221,LXVI,
15222,LXVI,
15223,LXVII,LXVII
15224,LXVII,
15225,LXVII,Dame Kriemhild at a window was standing there to view;
15226,LXVII,She look'd out for her kinsmen as friend for friends will do.
15227,LXVII,From her native country saw she many a man.
15228,LXVII,The king too heard the tidings and for joy to laugh began.
15229,LXVII,
15230,LXVII,
15231,LXVIII,LXVIII
15232,LXVIII,
15233,LXVIII,"""Now I at last am happy,"" exclaim'd th' exulting queen;"
15234,LXVIII,"""Hither are come my kinsmen with many a mailcoat sheen,"
15235,LXVIII,"And many a new-made buckler; who would for gold endeavor,"
15236,LXVIII,"Let him my wrongs remember, and I'll befriend him ever."
15237,LXVIII,
15238,LXVIII,
15239,LXIX,LXIX
15240,LXIX,
15241,LXIX,"""Yes! I will so contrive it, to take revenge for all"
15242,LXIX,At this same feast of Etzel's (whatever thereafter fall)
15243,LXIX,"On his abhorred body, who so the traitor play'd,"
15244,LXIX,"And all my joy so blasted.--I shall be now repaid."""

15256,I,"When now the bold Burgundians had come into the land,"
15257,I,"He of Bern soon heard it, the aged Hildebrand;"
15258,I,He told his lord the tidings; sore griev'd it the good knight;
15259,I,He begged him the stout strangers receive as best they might.
15260,I,
15261,I,
15262,II,II
15263,II,
15264,II,Straight to bring up the horses quick Wolfhart order gave;
15265,II,Then forward prick'd with Dietrich full many a champion brave.
15266,II,Thence to the field to greet them; as friends to friends they went.
15267,II,There had they pitch'd all ready full many a gorgeous tent.

15270,III,III
15271,III,
15272,III,"Them riding thus at distance soon as Sir Hagan spied,"

15368,XV,So the bold Burgundians to court thence took their way
15369,XV,After their country's fashion in pomp and proud array.
15370,XV,Many a stout knight of Hungary among the gazers came
15371,XV,"To look on Tronian Hagan, and mark his warrior frame."

15377,XVI,"That he it was who Siegfried, the Netherlander, slew,"
15378,XVI,"The strongest of all champions, Dame Kriemhild's husband bold."
15379,XVI,Hence much was there among them of Hagan ask'd and told.
15380,XVI,
15381,XVI,
15382,XVII,XVII
15383,XVII,
15384,XVII,Well grown and well compacted was that redoubted guest;

15392,XVIII,And now the bold Burgundians with shelter were supplied.
15393,XVIII,"The knights were lodg'd together, the rest were sunder'd wide."
15394,XVIII,"Through Kriemhild's hate to Gunther was plann'd this subtle train,"

15398,XIX,XIX
15399,XIX,
15400,XIX,"Dankwart was the marshal, Hagan's brother brave;"

15410,XX,She took her brother Giselher and took him by the hand.
15411,XX,That seeing drew Sir Hagan more tight his helmet's band.

15413,XX,
15414,XXI,XXI
15415,XXI,
15416,XXI,"""Sure after such a welcome,"" thus Hagan sternly spake,"

15423,XXII,
15424,XXII,"""To those who fain would see you,"" said Kriemhild, ""welcome be;"

15430,XXIII,XXIII
15431,XXIII,
15432,XXIII,"""Why these words, my lady?"" said Hagan, ""what's their drift?"
15433,XXIII,That all these knights from Rhineland should bring you each a gift?
15434,XXIII,"I knew you were so wealthy, and liv'd so royally,"
15435,XXIII,I need not bring you presents as far as Hungary.

15440,XXIV,"""Then with this one plain question your memory I must goad."
15441,XXIV,The Nibelungers' treasure--where have you that bestow'd?

15448,XXV,"""I' faith, my lady Kriemhild, 'tis now full many a day"

16350,XXXII,"Full soon unto Queen Kriemhild the sorry tidings came,"
16351,XXXII,That her men had compass'd nothing; it set her heart on flame.
16352,XXXII,"Another course she ventur'd, festering with fell despite,"

16373,II,Then broke the gleam of morning on those within the hall.
16374,II,"Straight began Sir Hagan to rouse the warriors all,"
16375,II,If they would to the minster the early mass to hear.
16376,II,Meanwhile in Christian fashion the bells were ringing clear.

16485,XVI,Right well heard Lady Kriemhild what Trony's knight replied.
16486,XVI,How bitterly the warrior under her lids she eyed!
16487,XVI,"Yet, though the truth well knowing as a Burgundian dame,"
16488,XVI,She would not to her husband her country's use proclaim.

16493,XVII,How deep soe'er and deadly the hate she bore her kin
16494,XVII,"Still, had the truth by any disclos'd to Etzel been,"
16495,XVII,He had at once prevented what afterward befell.
16496,XVII,Through proud contemptuous courage they scorn'd their wrongs to tell.

16500,XVIII,
16501,XVIII,"Then on went haughty Kriemhild girt with a mighty crowd,"
16502,XVIII,Yet swerve would not before her that pair of champions proud
16503,XVIII,So much as e'en two hands'-breadth; that gall'd th' Hungarians sore.
16504,XVIII,Perforce they press'd and jostled with the warriors through the door.
16505,XVIII,
16506,XVIII,
16507,XIX,XIX
16508,XIX,
16509,XIX,The chamberlains of Etzel therewith were ill content;
16510,XIX,They had straight the haughty strangers defied as in they went;
16511,XIX,But that they fear'd to do so their monarch's eyes before;
16512,XIX,"Pressing enough and jostling there was, but nothing more."

16516,XX,
16517,XX,"When serv'd was God as fitted, and thence would every one,"
16518,XX,Straight into the saddle leapt many a warlike Hun;
16519,XX,"The while around fair Kriemhild many a bright maid was seen,"
16520,XX,And full seven thousand champions begirt the stately queen.
16521,XX,
16522,XX,
16523,XXI,XXI
16524,XXI,
16525,XXI,Queen Kriemhild and her ladies now at the windows sat
16526,XXI,With the wide-ruling Etzel; well pleas'd was he with that.
16527,XXI,They would survey the tourney where knights their prowess show'd
16528,XXI,Ah! what stranger warriors in the court before them rode!
16529,XXI,
16530,XXI,
16531,XXII,XXII
16532,XXII,
16533,XXII,Thither too the marshal was with the yeomen come;
16534,XXII,"The redoubted Dankwart had muster'd, all and some,"
16535,XXII,"The followers of his master, the flower of Rhenish ground."
16536,XXII,For the bold Nibelungers well-saddled steeds were found.
16537,XXII,
16538,XXII,
16539,XXIII,XXIII
16540,XXIII,
16541,XXIII,"Thither the kings came riding and with them many a man,"
16542,XXIII,"When the good minstrel Folker to counsel this began,"
16543,XXIII,That they should joust together each in his country's mode.
16544,XXIII,Thereafter in the tourney the chiefs full knightly rode.
16545,XXIII,
16546,XXIII,
16547,XXIV,XXIV
16548,XXIV,
16549,XXIV,What so the warrior counsell'd gave all who heard content.
16550,XXIV,A mighty press and clatter uprose incontinent.
16551,XXIV,Into the court's broad circuit prick'd many a mighty man.
16552,XXIV,King Etzel and Queen Kriemhild now to look on began.
16553,XXIV,
16554,XXIV,
16555,XXV,XXV
16556,XXV,
16557,XXV,"There came into the tourney six hundred warriors fleet,"
16558,XXV,"Retainers of Sir Dietrich, the stranger knights to meet."
16559,XXV,With the bold Burgundians they long'd a course to run.
16560,XXV,Had Dietrich but permitted fain would they so have done.

16562,XXV,
16563,XXVI,XXVI
16564,XXVI,
16565,XXVI,Ah! what good knights among them rein'd the proud battle-steed!
16566,XXVI,To their good lord Sir Dietrich the news was brought with speed
16567,XXVI,"With Gunther's knights forbade he his knights a lance to cross,"
16568,XXVI,Naught from such game forboding but grief and deadly loss.

16570,XXVI,
16571,XXVII,XXVII
16572,XXVII,
16573,XXVII,"When now from out the tilt-yard the men of Bern were gone,"
16574,XXVII,"Sir Rudeger's retainers before the hall came on,"
16575,XXVII,Five hundred from Bechlaren with shields and armor gay.
16576,XXVII,Well had it pleas'd the margrave had they been far away.
16577,XXVII,
16578,XXVII,
16579,XXVIII,XXVIII
16580,XXVIII,
16581,XXVIII,"Then he rode in his wisdom up to the muster'd band,"
16582,XXVIII,"And earnestly bespake them, and gave to understand,"
16583,XXVIII,That Gunther's men were sullen and all on mischief bent;
16584,XXVIII,"If they would quit the tourney, 'twould give him much content."

16587,XXIX,XXIX
16588,XXIX,

16590,XXIX,"Then came the men of Thüringen, as has to us been told,"
16591,XXIX,And from the realm of Denmark a thousand proud and high.

16623,XXXIII,Against the bold Burgundians they knightly bore them all;
16624,XXXIII,High flew the whizzing splinters o'er the king's mighty hall.
16625,XXXIII,
16626,XXXIII,
16627,XXXIV,XXXIV
16628,XXXIV,

16630,XXXIV,"Hall might you hear and palace with clashing shields resound,"

16632,XXXIV,His train of that fair tourney the highest honors won.

16635,XXXV,XXXV
16636,XXXV,
16637,XXXV,"So great was then the pastime when front to front they met,"
16638,XXXV,That through the reeking foot-cloths forth burst the frothy sweat
16639,XXXV,"From the high-mettled coursers which the good knights bestrode,"
16640,XXXV,As 'gainst the lords of Hungary in haughty wise they rode.

17220,XXVI,They rush'd at him from both sides; none then would keep aloof;
17221,XXVI,"But, match'd with him, found many most speed was least behoof."
17222,XXVI,Right through his foes the champion made his red passage good
17223,XXVI,As through the dogs the wild-boar amidst the echoing wood.

18107,XXII,Worse would he have to suffer if once the truth were known
18108,XXII,"Well, too, the youthful Giselher perceiv'd he standing by."
18109,XXII,"Then thought he, from amongst them, by what device to fly."
18110,XXII,
18111,XXII,
18112,XXIII,XXIII
18113,XXIII,
18114,XXIII,From the blood he started; pressing was his need;
18115,XXIII,Sure for his good fortune he might thank his speed.
18116,XXIII,"From the house he darted just where Hagan stood,"
18117,XXIII,And struck at him in passing with all the force he could.

18124,XXIV,Yet with a wound through th' head-piece he straight Sir Hagan paid;

18127,XXIV,
18128,XXV,XXV
18129,XXV,
18130,XXV,"Soon as fierce Sir Hagan felt the gash and pain,"
18131,XXV,With his sword uplifted he rush'd upon the Dane.
18132,XXV,No more against his fury could Hawart's man make head;
18133,XXV,Swift down the stairs Sir Hagan pursued him as he fled.
18134,XXV,
18135,XXV,
18136,XXVI,XXVI
18137,XXVI,
18138,XXVI,Above his head bold Iring held up his buckler strong;
18139,XXVI,"Had that same scanty staircase been full trice as long,"
18140,XXVI,No time had Hagan left him to strike a single stroke.
18141,XXVI,Ah! what a shower of sparkles red from his morion broke!
18142,XXVI,
18143,XXVI,
18144,XXVII,XXVII
18145,XXVII,
18146,XXVII,Yet safe and sound Sir Iring came to his friends again.
18147,XXVII,"Soon then were told to Kriemhild th' achievements of the Dane,"
18148,XXVII,And what he unto Hagan had done with his good blade.
18149,XXVII,Thus unto the warrior her fervent thanks she paid.

18157,XXVIII,With her own hand then from him his shield for joy she took.

18164,XXIX,"If then he came back scathless, he'd be indeed a knight."
18165,XXIX,This scratch will boot you little; so e'en a child could smite.

18192,XXXIII,XXXIII
18193,XXXIII,
18194,XXXIII,"Soon was arm'd the warrior, and better than before;"
18195,XXXIII,He shook in wrath and fury the weighty spear he bore;
18196,XXXIII,With this against his foeman with sturdy strides he went.
18197,XXXIII,Hate-sparkling eyes upon him the fierce Sir Hagan bent.

18199,XXXIII,
18200,XXXIV,XXXIV

18204,XXXIV,"Now darting, and now smiting; his wrath was at the height;"
18205,XXXIV,Little then his prowess avail'd the Danish knight.

18207,XXXIV,
18208,XXXV,XXXV
18209,XXXV,
18210,XXXV,"The champions smote so fiercely, that fire-red blasts began"
18211,XXXV,To burn from either buckler; then Hawart's luckless man
18212,XXXV,So grievously was wounded by Hagan's monstrous main
18213,XXXV,"Through sever'd shield and morion, he ne'er was whole again."
18214,XXXV,
18215,XXXV,
18216,XXXVI,XXXVI
18217,XXXVI,
18218,XXXVI,That wound dash'd Iring's courage; he felt him ill bestead;
18219,XXXVI,He rais'd his shield yet higher to guard his bleeding head;
18220,XXXVI,"He deem'd it grievous mischief, the wound it was so sore;"
18221,XXXVI,Yet at the hand of Hagan had he to suffer more.
18222,XXXVI,
18223,XXXVI,
18224,XXXVII,XXXVII

18226,XXXVII,A spear the man of Gunther found lying at his feet;
18227,XXXVII,"This at the head of Iring he darted sure and fleet,"
18228,XXXVII,"So that the shaft outjutted, quivering, from his brow."
18229,XXXVII,A fatal end has Hagan made of his foeman now!

18231,XXXVII,
18232,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
18233,XXXVIII,
18234,XXXVIII,Back to his Danes Sir Iring recoil'd with faltering pace;
18235,XXXVIII,"Ere from his head his comrades the helmet could unlace,"
18236,XXXVIII,They broke from it the javelin; then close was death at hand.
18237,XXXVIII,"His kindred wept around him, a sorrow-laden band."

18265,XLII,
18266,XLII,His lively hue was faded; the stamp of death he bore;
18267,XLII,For the redoubted Iring his comrades sorrow'd sore.
18268,XLII,Never could recover stout Hawart's vassal true.
18269,XLII,Perforce each man of Denmark took to his sword anew.

18272,XLIII,XLIII
18273,XLIII,
18274,XLIII,Irnfried at once and Hawart both hurried toward the hall
18275,XLIII,With a thousand warriors; from amongst them all
18276,XLIII,Loud peal'd the shout of battle; fierce was their wrath and hot.
18277,XLIII,Ah! what a sleet of javelins at those of Rhine they shot!
18278,XLIII,
18279,XLIII,
18280,XLIV,XLIV
18281,XLIV,
18282,XLIV,"Upon the valiant gleeman bold Irnfried rush'd amain,"

18284,XLIV,A stern man was the minstrel as e'er in field met foe.
18285,XLIV,Through th' helm he smote the landgrave a deep and deadly blow.

18290,XLV,"Sir Irnfried on Sir Folker dealt too a sturdy stroke,"
18291,XLV,"That of his temper'd hauberk the links asunder broke,"
18292,XLV,And with the dint his harness all sparkled fiery red.
18293,XLV,Then straight before the minstrel down dropp'd the landgrave dead.

18298,XLVI,Sir Hawart and Sir Hagan clos'd too in deadly fight;
18299,XLVI,Their strife to each beholder was sure a wondrous sight.
18300,XLVI,"Huge strokes from their keen weapons fell thick on either side,"
18301,XLVI,Till by the stern Burgundian perforce Sir Hawart died.

18305,XLVII,
18306,XLVII,"When Danes now and Thüringians saw both their leaders slain,"
18307,XLVII,Against the house yet fiercer rush'd on the shouting train.
18308,XLVII,"Loud round the sounding portal the din of battle peal'd,"
18309,XLVII,"And many a helm was cloven, and shatter'd many a shield."

18324,XLIX,Beneath the deadly sword-strokes of the fierce warriors there.

18337,LI,
18338,LI,Thereafter reigned deep silence; the din of war was hush'd;
18339,LI,Through every creak and cranny the blood on all sides gush'd
18340,LI,From that huge hill of slaughter; red did the gutters run.
18341,LI,So much was through their prowess by those of Rhineland done!

18343,LI,
18344,LII,LII
18345,LII,
18346,LII,With that the bold Burgundians sat down awhile to rest.
18347,LII,His bloody sword and buckler down laid each panting guest.
18348,LII,"Still stood th' unwearied minstrel on guard the house before,"
18349,LII,To watch if any foeman should seek to force the door.

19823,XXIII,"Soon as the knights of Dietrich heard he indeed was dead,"

19975,XLII,Soon were they swept asunder by th' heady stream of fight;

20063,LIII,"At once so smote he Folker with weapon sharp and true,"
20064,LIII,That to the walls on all sides a shower of shivers flew
20065,LIII,From helm and eke from buckler like chaff before the blast.

20075,LIV,
20076,LIV,
20077,LV,LV
20078,LV,
20079,LV,Soon Hagan spied Sir Folker dead on the reeking floor;

20092,LVI,
20093,LVII,LVII
20094,LVII,
20095,LVII,Just then the stalwart Helfrich slew Dankwart the good knight;
20096,LVII,"Gunther as well as Giselher, woe were they at the sight,"
20097,LVII,"When down he fell, and, writhing, out panted his last breath."
20098,LVII,He with his sword beforehand had well reveng'd his death.

20109,LIX,LIX
20110,LIX,
20111,LIX,"Meanwhile redoubted Wolfhart rush'd fiercely to and fro,"
20112,LIX,King Gunther's men down hewing with oft-repeated blow.
20113,LIX,Thrice through that place of slaughter he cut his bloody way.

20128,LXI,Each in that grim battle wounds cut gaping wide.
20129,LXI,"Upon the king fierce rushing so forcefully he sped,"
20130,LXI,The blood beneath his trampling flew high above his head.

20132,LXI,
20133,LXII,LXII
20134,LXII,
20135,LXII,The bold son of fair Uta with many a rapid blow

20145,LXIII,So to the death he wounded that high o'erweening one.
20146,LXIII,'Twas sure a peerless champion who such a deed had done.

20149,LXIV,LXIV
20150,LXIV,
20151,LXIV,"Soon as fearless Wolfhart felt the deadly pain,"
20152,LXIV,Down he dropp'd his buckler; with fierce hand amain
20153,LXIV,His huge sharp-cutting broadsword higher he heav'd in air;
20154,LXIV,Through helm at once and hauberk then smote he Giselher.
20155,LXIV,
20156,LXIV,
20157,LXV,LXV
20158,LXV,
20159,LXV,So they one another both of their lives bereft.
20160,LXV,Now of all Dietrich's liegemen not a soul was left.
20161,LXV,"Hildebrand, the aged, dead saw Wolfhart fall;"
20162,LXV,Among his long life's sorrows that was the worst of all.

20165,LXVI,LXVI
20166,LXVI,
20167,LXVI,"There in that hall of slaughter dead lay King Gunther's train,"
20168,LXVI,Dead too the men of Dietrich. Sir Hildebrand amain
20169,LXVI,"Ran where redoubted Wolfhart fall'n in the blood he found,"
20170,LXVI,And cast his arms about him to lift him from the ground.
20171,LXVI,
20172,LXVI,
20173,LXVII,LXVII
20174,LXVII,
20175,LXVII,"He drove his dying nephew forth from the house to bear,"
20176,LXVII,But found his weight too mighty; he needs must leave him there.
20177,LXVII,Then from the blood the wounded a clouded glance upcast;
20178,LXVII,He saw that fain his uncle had help'd him at the last.
20179,LXVII,
20180,LXVII,
20181,LXVIII,LXVIII

20217,LXXII,Had ta'en from noble Siegfried when he the hero slew.
20218,LXXII,Well was his onset warded by the graybeard stout and true.

20220,LXXII,
20221,LXXIII,LXXIII
20222,LXXIII,
20223,LXXIII,Sir Dietrich's aged liegeman the fearful stroke repaid
20224,LXXIII,"With one that show'd, that he, too, wielded a griding blade;"
20225,LXXIII,Still from the man of Gunther no drop of blood he drew.
20226,LXXIII,Sir Hagan with a second cut his good hauberk through.
20227,LXXIII,
20228,LXXIII,
20229,LXXIV,LXXIV
20230,LXXIV,
20231,LXXIV,"Soon as aged Hildebrand felt the sharp gash aright,"

20235,LXXIV,
20236,LXXIV,
20237,LXXV,LXXV
20238,LXXV,
20239,LXXV,Now not a man was living of that Burgundian train

20833,NOTES,"According to Professor Lachmann, this poem has no title in most of the"
20834,NOTES,"manuscripts. In the two that have a superscription, it is styled the"
20835,NOTES,"Book of Kriemhild. Its ordinary name, The Nibelungenlied, is derived"
20836,NOTES,"from the Lassberg manuscript which ends with the words, _der Nibelunge"
20837,NOTES,"liet_, the lay of the Nibelungs, while the better manuscripts for _liet_"
20838,NOTES,"read _nôt_, calamity. The word Nibelung is a patronymic from _nebel_,"
20839,NOTES,"mist or darkness, and means, child of mist or darkness. Who these"
20840,NOTES,Nibelungs were is involved in appropriate obscurity. In the first part
20841,NOTES,"of the poem, they are Siegfried's Norwegian dependents, formerly"
20842,NOTES,"subjects of King Nibelung; in the second, they are the Burgundians,"
20843,NOTES,possibly as being then the possessors of the wondrous treasure. In F.H.
20844,NOTES,"von der Hagen's Remarks on the poem, there is a long rambling note on"
20845,NOTES,"this word, a note, however, which is worth reading. The commentator"
20846,NOTES,"travels from the Nephilim, or giants of scripture, down to Neville, the"
20847,NOTES,"great Earl of Warwick, and his coal-black head of hair. I have followed"
20848,NOTES,"Mr. Birch in using the form _Nibelunger_, as more convenient for the"

20908,THIRD ADVENTURE,"of the serpent tribe, who inherited the like miserly passion, and"
20909,THIRD ADVENTURE,allured such champions as Siegfried and Orlando to tread in the steps of
20910,THIRD ADVENTURE,Hercules and Jason. The volatile disposition of Wayland the Smith
20911,THIRD ADVENTURE,reminds us of Dædalus; his skill in his art exhibits him as a rival of
20912,THIRD ADVENTURE,"Vulcan; his grandfather Wiking, like Ulysses, ""_æquoreas torsit amore"

21062,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,(St. XVI.) This description of a castle (_burc_) does not materially
21063,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,differ from those which occur elsewhere in the poem. The castle was not
21064,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"one building, however large and complex, but included in the same ample"
21065,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"circuit of its walls several extensive buildings, and afforded"
21066,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,sufficient accommodation for a very great number of persons. The most
21067,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,conspicuous of the buildings within the castle seem to have been large
21068,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"detached erections, to which in this poem are applied the words _hûs_"
21069,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"(house), _palas_ (palace), _sal_ (hall), and _gadem_ (room). In the"
21070,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"passage before us, _palas_ and _sal_ are distinguished from one another;"
21071,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"the same is the case at St. LXXXIV, Twenty-fourth Adventure (_palas unde"
21072,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"sal_), and at St. XXXVII, Ninth Adventure, where Etzel's and Gunther's"
21073,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"dwellings are respectively spoken of. On the other hand, the hall where"
21074,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"the Burgundians feast with Etzel, and where the repeated conflicts take"
21075,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"place, is called _palas_ at St. XIX, Thirty-sixth Adventure, _sal_ at"
21076,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"St. XX, same Adventure, _hûs_ at St. IX, same Adventure, and _gadem_ at"
21077,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"St. XX, Thirty-ninth Adventure, not to mention other passages; and the"
21078,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"large building in Etzel's castle, where Gunther and his knights sleep,"
21079,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"is called _sal_ at stanzas VII and XVI, _hûs_ at stanzas XV and XVII,"
21080,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"and _gadem_ at St. XIX, of the Thirtieth Adventure. These terms"
21081,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"therefore seem nearly synonymous, or at least equally applicable to the"
21082,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"large detached buildings in question, which resembled our public halls,"
21083,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"such as Westminster hall and Guild-hall, and the halls of colleges and"
21084,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Inns of Court. Some of the halls in this poem seem to have been of truly
21085,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"poetical dimensions. Gunther (St. XXVI, of the Thirteenth Adventure)"
21086,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"entertains in his hall twelve hundred knights of Siegfried's, besides"
21087,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,his own Burgundians. Etzel's circle was still more numerous. The
21088,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Burgundian knights were more than a thousand in number; Rudeger's five
21089,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"hundred or more: Dietrich had many a stately man, no doubt the six"
21090,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"hundred mentioned at St. IV, of the Thirty-second Adventure, and we"
21091,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"learn from stanza V, of the Thirty-fourth Adventure, that 7,000 Huns"
21092,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,were massacred by the Burgundians; all these made up a dinner party of
21093,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"about 9,000 guests. The less aristocratic followers of Gunther, 9,000 in"
21094,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"number, seem also to have been feasting in one immense room, when the"
21095,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,Huns took advantage of their unarmed condition to massacre them. The
21096,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"term, indeed, applied to the building is _hûs_, but this, we have seen,"
21097,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"is one of the words used to designate great public halls. The hall,"
21098,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"where Gunther and his knights lay so splendidly (St. IX, Thirtieth"
21099,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Adventure), seems to have been an Eton Long Chamber on a gigantic scale."
21100,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"After allowing for the twelve knights with Dankwart and the yeomen, he"
21101,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,must have had more than a thousand warriors in his train. Treachery and
21102,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"violence were so common in the Middle Ages, that a great man was not"
21103,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"safe except with a multitude of dependents about him, and the peculiar"
21104,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,circumstances of Gunther's case required peculiar precaution. Yet even
21105,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Siegfried took a thousand warriors of his own, and a hundred of"
21106,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Siegmund's, when they went together to visit his brother-in-law. These"
21107,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"large halls were used for feasting, dancing, conversation, and sleeping,"
21108,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,but there were other smaller separate buildings (_kemenaten_) for the
21109,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"residence of people of consequence, which no doubt contained several"
21110,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"rooms. These also formed the bowers, or private apartments, of high-born"
21111,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,ladies. The _kamere_ (chamber) seems to have been a room used for all
21112,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"sorts of purposes, among others for keeping stores and treasure as well"
21113,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,as for living and sleeping. There seem to have been no private chapels
21114,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"within the walls of the castles described in this poem, none, for"
21115,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"instance, such as St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle, or the chapels"
21116,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,in our Inns of Court and Colleges. Everybody went for his divinity to
21117,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"the minster. Kriemhild, who was in the habit of going to matins before"
21118,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"daybreak, took her way to the minster, though it was so far from the"
21119,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"castle at Worms that the ladies (St. XXXIV, Thirteenth Adventure) rode"
21120,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,on horseback from one to the other. Gunther's castle was connected with
21121,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"the city of Worms, but seems to have communicated with the surrounding"
21122,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"country, like the citadels of our present fortified towns. At stanzas"
21123,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"XXXII, XXXIII, Thirteenth Adventure, the ladies view from the castle"
21124,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,windows a tournament held in the country outside the walls. Etzel's
21125,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"castle, as far as I remember, is not represented as connected with any"
21126,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,town.
21127,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
21128,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,(St. XXII.) All this description of the adventurers bears a resemblance
21129,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,to the passage in the Iliad where Helen points out the Greek chiefs to

21162,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"scarcely imagine to have been passed over without notice, though I admit"
21163,SEVENTH ADVENTURE,that they are not related in the clearest manner.

21194,NINTH ADVENTURE,"than the composer of the first, and that it resembles in several"
21195,NINTH ADVENTURE,"respects the Third Lay of his edition, which answers to the Fifth"

21198,NINTH ADVENTURE,"(St. III.) Hagan here speaks ironically, but with good nature, as to a"

21200,NINTH ADVENTURE,"the change of circumstances and the person whom he addresses, in his"

21203,NINTH ADVENTURE,"(St. XXVII, Ninth Adventure.) The lady supplies the place of the modern"
21204,NINTH ADVENTURE,pocket handkerchief _mit snêblanken gêren_ in the original. The German
21205,NINTH ADVENTURE,"_gêre_ is evidently the English _gore_, a word which puzzled no less a"
21206,NINTH ADVENTURE,"person than Tyrwhitt, and which Johnson, who writes it _goar_, has"
21207,NINTH ADVENTURE,confounded with the _gusset_. The latter is the piece under the arm of a
21208,NINTH ADVENTURE,"shirt; the gore, as Tyrwhitt was afterward accurately informed by ""a"
21209,NINTH ADVENTURE,"learned person,"" is a common name for a slip, which is inserted to widen"
21210,NINTH ADVENTURE,"a garment in any particular part. It is a wedge-shaped piece, as the"
21211,NINTH ADVENTURE,"German commentators say of their _gêre_. Shirts at present, however it"
21212,NINTH ADVENTURE,"may have been in Chaucer's or in Tyrwhitt's time, are not made with"
21213,NINTH ADVENTURE,gores; the opening on each side renders gores unnecessary; but in the
21214,NINTH ADVENTURE,"female of the shirt and in the smockfrock, gores are, I believe, still"
21215,NINTH ADVENTURE,used. The passage in Chaucer illustrates the passage before us. The poet
21216,NINTH ADVENTURE,"says of the Carpenter's Wife (Canterbury Tales, 3235)--"
21217,NINTH ADVENTURE,
21218,NINTH ADVENTURE,"A seint (girdle) she wered, barred all of silk,"
21219,NINTH ADVENTURE,A barme-cloth (apron) eke white as morwe (morning) milk
21220,NINTH ADVENTURE,Upon hire lendes (loins) full of many a gore.
21221,NINTH ADVENTURE,
21222,NINTH ADVENTURE,"In the last line the expression ""full of many a gore"" means, probably,"
21223,NINTH ADVENTURE,"full made, spread out by means of many a gore; otherwise ""full of gores"""
21224,NINTH ADVENTURE,"would have been sufficient, and the addition of ""many"" an inelegant"
21225,NINTH ADVENTURE,"piece of surplusage. However that may be, it is clear that the apron"
21226,NINTH ADVENTURE,stuck out and extended round the person of the wearer in consequence of
21227,NINTH ADVENTURE,"the number of these gores, or wedge-shaped pieces, which made the bottom"
21228,NINTH ADVENTURE,"much wider than the top. An apron, thus made up of a multitude of gores,"
21229,NINTH ADVENTURE,"might not unaptly be itself called in the plural a woman's gores, and"
21230,NINTH ADVENTURE,this seems to have been formerly the case in Germany. Kriemhild is here
21231,NINTH ADVENTURE,"said to wipe her eyes with snow-white gores, and, in the Gudrun, the"
21232,NINTH ADVENTURE,heroine of that name is rated by the tyrannical Gerlind for wrapping up
21233,NINTH ADVENTURE,her hands indolently in her gores. It is of course impossible for a
21234,NINTH ADVENTURE,"translator to render these two passages literally, at least if he wishes"
21235,NINTH ADVENTURE,to be intelligible.
21236,NINTH ADVENTURE,
21237,NINTH ADVENTURE,(St. XLVIII.) The commentators are not particularly clear as to what
21238,NINTH ADVENTURE,"these garments, called in the original ""noble Ferrans robes,"" really"
21239,NINTH ADVENTURE,were. Von der Hagan says there must have been a city of that name in the
21240,NINTH ADVENTURE,"East, from which these robes came, while Lachmann says there is a stuff"
21241,NINTH ADVENTURE,"composed of silk and wool, which still goes by the name of _ferrandine_."

21268,DCCV.,"(St. LXXXI.) If this and the following stanza are, as Lachmann thinks,"
21269,DCCV.,"an addition, they no doubt were added to supply a palpable defect in the"
21270,DCCV.,"narrative. If it were not for them, the company would be spoken of as"
21271,DCCV.,rising from table (St. LXXXIV) when it is nowhere mentioned that they
21272,DCCV.,had sat down.
21273,DCCV.,
21274,DCCV.,I must venture to remark that Lachmann's note to the next stanza is not
21275,DCCV.,very satisfactory. Though the knights and ladies may usually have eaten
21276,DCCV.,"apart, it seems to have been allowable for the mistress of the house at"
21277,DCCV.,"least to be present when the knights were feasting (St. XXVI, this"
21278,DCCV.,"Adventure, to St. XXIII, Twenty-seventh Adventure), and there is nothing"
21279,DCCV.,unreasonable in supposing that the married sister of the host might have
21280,DCCV.,accompanied her husband. This seems more natural than to assume that the
21281,DCCV.,queens left their apartments and went to the hall (probably a detached
21282,DCCV.,building) just to show themselves before they retired to bed. I must own
21283,DCCV.,I do not see the difficulty about _coming_ and _going_ noticed by
21284,DCCV.,"Lachmann. Everybody, who goes to a place, comes to it when he gets"
21285,DCCV.,"there. As the poem stands, everything is consistent. The queens cross"
21286,DCCV.,the palace court and go to the hall for the good substantial reason of
21287,DCCV.,"getting their suppers. They come back to their private apartments, or"
21288,DCCV.,"bowers, where they remain awhile with their immediate attendants, and"
21289,DCCV.,"during the short interval, that elapses before dismissing the latter and"
21290,DCCV.,"going to bed, Siegfried slips through his wife's fingers, and goes to"
21291,DCCV.,Gunther's private apartments.
21292,DCCV.,
21293,DCCV.,"I should add that, at St. XXIV, Twenty-seventh Adventure, the young"
21294,DCCV.,margravine and her damsels are brought back into the eating hall after
21295,DCCV.,"the men have finished their repast, but that depends on the correctness"
21296,DCCV.,"of the reading _die schoenen_ (see note to St. XXXI, Twenty-seventh"
21297,DCCV.,Adventure) and on the consequent expulsion of the latter stanza. If we
21298,DCCV.,"retain the latter stanza, the young margravine is sent for _ze hove_,"
21299,DCCV.,"like Kriemhild at St. XXXI, Tenth Adventure. But we can scarcely apply"
21300,DCCV.,"to young married women and their near female connections, also married,"
21301,DCCV.,"passages like these, that relate to young spinsters. In the passages"
21302,DCCV.,"quoted in the note to St. XXIV, Twenty-seventh Adventure, men and women"
21303,DCCV.,"are mentioned as eating apart, but it is stated to be an old custom, and"
21304,DCCV.,is noted as an ancient peculiarity.
21305,DCCV.,
21306,DCCV.,"(St. LXXXV, Tenth Adventure.) It appears from this description that the"
21307,DCCV.,wearer of the cloak must have had the power of being visible or
21308,DCCV.,"invisible as he chose. He might have on the mantle, and yet be visible."
21309,DCCV.,"Siegfried does not here leave his wife in the ordinary way, and then put"
21310,DCCV.,on the cloak. He seems to disappear miraculously. This differs from the
21311,DCCV.,"account given in stanzas XLIII, Seventh Adventure, and LXXXIV, of the"
21312,DCCV.,"same, where Siegfried puts on the cloak before he becomes invisible, and"
21313,DCCV.,"remains so till he puts it off, but agrees with St. XXI, Nineteenth"
21314,DCCV.,"Adventure, where it is distinctly stated that Siegfried wore the cloak"
21315,DCCV.,"at all times. I should however add that, in the original, there is what"
21316,DCCV.,"appears to my ignorance a difficulty, though, as the commentators take"
21317,DCCV.,"no notice of it, I suppose there is really none. The original stands"
21318,DCCV.,thus:--
21319,DCCV.,
21320,DCCV.,"Sî trûte sîne hende mit ir vil wîzen hant,"
21321,DCCV.,"Unz er vor ir augen, sine wesse wenne, verswant,"
21322,DCCV.,
21323,DCCV.,"literally, ""She fondled his hands with her very white hand, till he"
21324,DCCV.,"before her eyes, she knew not when, vanished."" As to the interpreters,"
21325,DCCV.,"Braunfels simply modernizes the old dialect, rendering _wenne_ by"
21326,DCCV.,"_wann_; Simrock and Marbach are equally literal, except that they put"
21327,DCCV.,"_wie_, how, where Braunfels has _wann_; Beta, who here as elsewhere is"
21328,DCCV.,"less rigorously literal than his comrades, merely says, ""then it"
21329,DCCV.,"happened that he suddenly vanished before her sight."" I must confess I"
21330,DCCV.,cannot understand how Kriemhild could not know _when_ a thing happened
21331,DCCV.,"that passed before her eyes, though she might well be puzzled how to"
21332,DCCV.,"account for it. It is remarkable that the Lassberg manuscript, which is"
21333,DCCV.,said by Lachmann and other competent judges to contain a revised and
21334,DCCV.,"remodelled text, omits altogether St. LXXXVI, Tenth Adventure, and"
21335,DCCV.,"alters the stanza before it, and that after it in such a way, that the"
21336,DCCV.,"supernatural seems to disappear, and Siegfried is merely represented as"
21337,DCCV.,"stealing away from the women, and coming secretly and mysteriously (_vil"
21338,DCCV.,tougen_) to Gunther's chamber. This manuscript however mentions the
21339,DCCV.,"tarnkappe at St. LXXVII, same Adventure. Did the reviser of this"
21340,DCCV.,"manuscript wish it to be inferred, that Siegfried, after leaving his"
21341,DCCV.,"wife, went and put on the tarnkappe?"
21342,DCCV.,
21343,DCCV.,"(St. CX.) In the Volsunga Saga Brunhild is a Valkyrie, or Chooser of the"
21344,DCCV.,"Slain, a sort of Northern Bellona, endowed with supernatural strength."
21345,DCCV.,"This superhuman prowess is connected with her virgin state, and by"
21346,DCCV.,becoming a wife she is reduced to the ordinary weakness of woman. In the

21445,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,to this with more bitterness than delicacy.
21446,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,
21447,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,(St. XLI.) Brunhild seems as much annoyed by this usurpation of her

21450,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,
21451,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,(St. L.) I have followed Professor Lachmann's explanation of the first

21453,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,"St. XXXI, Fifteenth Adventure, but whatever we may think of his general"
21454,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,"theory of the poem, his prefatory remarks here are well worth an"
21455,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,"attentive perusal. It is clear that some stanzas, probably a good many,"
21456,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,"have been lost. As the work stands at present, even if we interpret the"
21457,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,"first line of this stanza to mean that many a fair woman departed,"
21458,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,Siegfried is left behind to hear his brother-in-law and his friends
21459,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,discuss the expediency of knocking him on the head. In the part that is
21460,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,lost there was probably an account of the breaking up of the assemblage
21461,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,"at the church door, and of the immediate summoning of a council in some"
21462,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,"more convenient place. It was no doubt explained how Siegfried's denial,"
21463,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,"which at first seemed so satisfactory, was afterward made of no account,"
21464,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,"and possibly a good deal, of which we have now only a fragment in"
21465,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,"stanzas L--LI, passed between Brunhild and Hagan, her husband's"
21466,FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE,"principal adviser. Probably, too, as Lachmann has observed, the"

21474,FIFTEENTH ADVENTURE,"which, however, he thinks, suits perfectly with the ""somewhat"
21475,FIFTEENTH ADVENTURE,"over-charged coloring"" which the author has adopted. Pictures of"
21476,FIFTEENTH ADVENTURE,"domestic happiness in the same style of coloring are, I suppose, rarely"

21481,FIFTEENTH ADVENTURE,(St. XXXVI.) The Wask forest is the mountainous range called in French
21482,FIFTEENTH ADVENTURE,"the Vosges, which, as well as Worms, is to the west of the Rhine; this"
21483,FIFTEENTH ADVENTURE,"stanza is therefore at variance with St. I, Seventeenth Adventure, where"
21484,FIFTEENTH ADVENTURE,the hunters cross the Rhine to return to Worms. Lachmann gets over the
21485,FIFTEENTH ADVENTURE,difficulty by his theory of separate lays. According to his arrangement
21486,FIFTEENTH ADVENTURE,"St. XXXVI, this Adventure, is in the Seventh Lay, and St. I, Seventeenth"
21487,FIFTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Adventure, in the Eighth, and these two Lays are the work of different"
21488,FIFTEENTH ADVENTURE,"poets. Two points are certain; the first, that there were two traditions"
21489,FIFTEENTH ADVENTURE,"as to the place of Siegfried's death, one fixing it in the Waskenwald,"
21490,FIFTEENTH ADVENTURE,"the other in the Odenwald; the second, that Gunther and Hagan were"
21491,FIFTEENTH ADVENTURE,generally believed to have attacked Walter of Spain in the Waskenwald.
21492,FIFTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Now there appears to me nothing improbable in supposing, either that a"
21493,FIFTEENTH ADVENTURE,minstrel with his head full of Walter's history and the connection of
21494,FIFTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Gunther and Hagan with the Waskenwald, might have recited _Waskenwalde_"
21495,FIFTEENTH ADVENTURE,"for _Otenwalde_, or, on the other hand, that one, who was familiar with"
21496,FIFTEENTH ADVENTURE,"the tradition that Siegfried was killed in the Odenwald, might have"
21497,FIFTEENTH ADVENTURE,"found _an den Rîn_ at St. XXXVII, Sixteenth Adventure, and altered it to"
21498,FIFTEENTH ADVENTURE,_über Rîn_. At any rate I cannot help thinking that either of these
21499,FIFTEENTH ADVENTURE,suppositions is less improbable than that a poet should first tell us
21500,FIFTEENTH ADVENTURE,"how Gunther and Hagan plotted against Siegfried, how the latter accepted"
21501,FIFTEENTH ADVENTURE,"their treacherous invitation to the hunt, and how he went to take leave"
21502,FIFTEENTH ADVENTURE,"of his wife, and that then the provoking rogue should immediately close"

21540,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,seems to have been produced by different sorts of fur. The _grâ unde
21541,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"bunt_ of St. XVI, Third Adventure, seems to mean the same thing. Gold"
21542,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"thread or wire, and something like gold lace appear to have been"
21543,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"fashionable ornaments in the dress of both sexes. Precious stones, too,"
21544,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,were in great request. But I own I have been much puzzled by the
21545,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"milliners' and tailors' work in the poem, and I dare say have made"
21546,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,mistakes. I may observe that the women were both tailors and milliners.
21547,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"Kriemhild herself was an accomplished cutter (see St. XLIV, Sixth"

21556,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"(St. LIV.) The fourth line of this stanza, which is admitted as genuine"

21558,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"not merely with his theory, but with that which attributes the two parts"
21559,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,of the poem to two different authors. It refers to the slaughter toward
21560,SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE,"the close of the second part, and would be impertinent and out of place"

21579,SEVENTEENTH ADVENTURE,
21580,SEVENTEENTH ADVENTURE,(St. IX.) The two last lines of this stanza and the two first of the
21581,SEVENTEENTH ADVENTURE,"next are rejected by Professor Lachmann, because, as he thinks, they"
21582,SEVENTEENTH ADVENTURE,"contradict the last line of St. XI, where Kriemhild professes her"
21583,SEVENTEENTH ADVENTURE,"ignorance of the murderer. But Kriemhild is not a witness on oath, but a"
21584,SEVENTEENTH ADVENTURE,"woman in a frenzy of grief, who does not weigh her words, but one moment"
21585,SEVENTEENTH ADVENTURE,"utters an obvious suspicion, as if it were an ascertained fact, and the"
21586,SEVENTEENTH ADVENTURE,"next confesses that she has no positive proof, and cannot act upon what"
21587,SEVENTEENTH ADVENTURE,"she feels to be true. There is no very great inconsistency in saying,"
21588,SEVENTEENTH ADVENTURE,"""A. and B. are at the bottom of this: if I could only bring it home to"
21589,SEVENTEENTH ADVENTURE,"them, I'd make them smart for it."" But the neuter pronoun in the third"
21590,SEVENTEENTH ADVENTURE,"line, referring to _houbet_ in the second, proves that the second line"
21591,SEVENTEENTH ADVENTURE,"is not interpolated. Professor Lachmann, indeed, gets over the"
21592,SEVENTEENTH ADVENTURE,difficulty by altering the gender of the pronoun to the masculine.
21593,SEVENTEENTH ADVENTURE,
21594,SEVENTEENTH ADVENTURE,(St. XI.) The last verse of this stanza seems a preparation for the
21595,SEVENTEENTH ADVENTURE,display of Kriemhild's character in a new point of view. The softer
21596,SEVENTEENTH ADVENTURE,parts of her character have been exhibited thus far; her revengeful and
21597,SEVENTEENTH ADVENTURE,"unforgiving spirit will gradually swallow up every other feeling, and at"

21640,NINETEENTH ADVENTURE,"operation at St. LXXXV, Tenth Adventure, but is inconsistent with"
21641,NINETEENTH ADVENTURE,"stanzas XLIII-LXXXIV, Seventh Adventure, from which last it would seem"

21643,NINETEENTH ADVENTURE,"become invisible, and to put it off when he wished to become visible"

21646,NINETEENTH ADVENTURE,difficulty here. From Alberic's words it would seem that the possession

21683,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,Attila and the Huns with much relating to the Nibelungenlied in the late
21684,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,Hon. and Rev. William Herbert's Historical Treatise subjoined to his
21685,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,Poem on Attila.
21686,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
21687,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,(St. V.) The Margrave Rudeger is perhaps the most interesting character
21688,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"in the poem, but there is no one, with regard to whom the historical,"
21689,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"the legendary, and the mythical are more unintelligibly jumbled. Whether"
21690,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"he was an historical Austrian Margrave of the tenth century, a mere"
21691,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"legendary hero, or ""a divine being,"" as Lachmann is disposed to think"
21692,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"him, is more than any plain Englishman can venture to decide. It seems"
21693,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"that his native country was Arabia, but whether by that name is meant"
21694,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"the region commonly so called, or a district in the centre of Spain, is"
21695,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"as yet anything but a settled point. Wherever it was, he was driven from"
21696,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"it by a king of Toledo, and took refuge with Etzel."
21697,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
21698,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,(St. XX.) I am uncertain whether I have given the true meaning of this
21699,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"stanza, which is rejected by Lachmann, and, indeed, can scarcely be"
21700,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,reconciled with the rest. I have used _Hun_ and _Hungarian_
21701,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"indifferently. The Hungarians were of a different race from the Huns,"
21702,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"but Mr. Hallam says of them, ""The memory of Attila was renewed in the"
21703,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"devastations of these savages, who, if they were not his compatriots,"
21704,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"resembled them both in their countenances and customs."""
21705,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
21706,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"(St. XXXI.) See Lachmann (St. 1113, L.) who conjectures _ersiwet_ for"
21707,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,_erfüllet_ or _ir sulet_.

21709,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,(St. XLVII.) This refers to something not related in this poem.
21710,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
21711,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,(St. LIX.) Here again is an allusion to something not mentioned in the
21712,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"poem, namely, to some service rendered by Rudeger to Hagan."
21713,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,
21714,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"(St. LXIV.) The poet, who put this speech into the mouth of Gunther,"

21721,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"(St. CXLV.) In the last line of this stanza, the plural of the verb is"
21722,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"authorized by three manuscripts, and, though they may be none of the"
21723,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"best, their readings deserve attention, when they are commanded by"
21724,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,necessity and common sense. The plural (_in_ for _ihnen_) in the
21725,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,preceding line requires the plural in this. The young ladies cried at
21726,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"leaving home, but were soon reconciled to their lot by the gayeties of"
21727,TWENTIETH ADVENTURE,"King Etzel's court. If the reader is not satisfied with this, he can"

21757,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"the first, nobody could tolerate the frigidity and abject style of the"
21758,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"two last. For my own part, I am more struck by the absurdity of"
21759,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Rudeger's caution to Kriemhild not to kiss all Etzel's men. I suppose he
21760,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,was afraid she would have no lips left after such reiterated osculation.

21762,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,(St. XIX.) These German strangers or guests (_Tiuschen gesten_) are the
21763,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Burgundians according to von der Hagen, but Thüringians according to"
21764,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Lachmann. The latter says, the expression does not occur elsewhere in"
21765,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"the Lays of the Nibelungers. This restricted use of a term, which was"

21777,TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,of which poems tournaments are exhibited with far more pomp and

21800,TWENTY-FOURTH ADVENTURE,necessary to know when an entertainment is to take place in order to

21822,TWENTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"not fulfilled, ""quite against the prophetic style of this lay;"" but I"
21823,TWENTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"venture to submit that this is no prediction at all, but a mere"
21824,TWENTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"expression of the very natural opinion that, if any army should attempt"
21825,TWENTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,"to swim a large river in a state of flood, many may be swept away and"
21826,TWENTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE,drowned. Gernot makes a similar remark on the want of a boatman at St.

21831,LXIV.,"Choosers of the Slain, which enabled its wearers to assume the shape of"
21832,LXIV.,"swans, or at least to fly away. Hagan therefore had good ground to begin"
21833,LXIV.,"with laying hands on the wardrobe of these water-nymphs, though his"
21834,LXIV.,reason for doing so is so obscurely alluded to in the poem that it may
21835,LXIV.,be doubted whether the poet was himself aware of the original force of
21836,LXIV.,"the legend. In the traditions respecting Vælund, Wieland, or Wayland the"
21837,LXIV.,"Smith, that hero captures a wife by a similar stratagem. The swan-maiden"
21838,LXIV.,"in Wieland's case was one of the Valkyries, and indeed the two mermaids"
21839,LXIV.,"in the Nibelungenlied appear, from the part assigned to them in the"
21840,LXIV.,"poem, to be genuine Choosers of the Slain. These swan-maidens, as far as"
21841,LXIV.,"their volatile character is concerned, seem to have given a hint to the"
21842,LXIV.,author of Peter Wilkins.

21844,LXIV.,"(St. XLVIII.) So in the old lay of Hildebrand (a fragment of which,"

21847,LXIV.,"library of Cassel by W. Grimm) that hero offers arm-rings to his son,"
21848,LXIV.,"who, not knowing him, had challenged him to fight. It was the custom to"
21849,LXIV.,"offer such rings on the point of a sword or spear, and to receive them"
21850,LXIV.,"in the same way. To prove this, W. Grimm quotes this passage among"
21851,LXIV.,"others. See Lachmann's treatise on the ""Lay of Hildebrand"" in the"
21852,LXIV.,"Transactions of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, 1833. The same word"

21912,TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
21913,TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,(St. XXXI.) There is a difficulty here from its being said that the
21914,TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"young margravine was desired to go to court, _i.e._, to the assembly in"
21915,TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"the hall, when at St. XXIV the ladies (_die schönen_ in the original)"
21916,TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,had already returned thither. Lachmann removes the difficulty by
21917,TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"condemning the stanzas XXXI, XXXII, XXXIV as spurious; he thinks it"
21918,TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,impossible that anyone can collect from the third line of St. XXII that
21919,TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,the men went into a different hall from that which they had entered at
21920,TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,St. XIX; but it is not the third but the second line of St. XXII that

21926,TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,now who can collect from this verse that the women went and the men
21927,TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"stayed? If words mean anything, both went away. As to the return of the"
21928,TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"ladies at St. XXIV, that rests on a doubtful reading, _die schönen_, the"
21929,TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"fair ones, whereas the best manuscript, that on which Professor"
21930,TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"Lachmann's text is generally founded, reads _die künen_, the bold ones,"
21931,TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,meaning the knights. I should add that the preliminary conversation from

21934,TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,(St. XLIV.) These foreign champions are the Burgundians themselves
21935,TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"according to von der Hagen. This is far from satisfactory, but I can"
21936,TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,offer nothing more so. Can it be possible that there was once a version
21937,TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"(now lost) of the story, in which the Nibelungers, properly so called,"
21938,TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,accompanied the Burgundians into Hungary? This might account not merely
21939,TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"for these foreign champions, but for the term _Nibelunge_ being applied"

21941,TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,is obscure and confused to the last degree.

21946,TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,(St. LXVI.) Lachmann transposes this and the two following stanzas to
21947,TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"after St. XVI, Twenty-eighth Adventure, where they form the beginning of"
21948,TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"his Sixteenth Lay, which ends with St. XLIV, Twenty-ninth Adventure. The"
21949,TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,speech which begins at the third line of this stanza is attributed to
21950,TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"the messenger by von der Hagen, and perhaps justly, as appears from the"
21951,TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"last verse of the next stanza, from which it would seem that the king"
21952,TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"heard the news afterward. On the other hand, Kriemhild here is addressed"
21953,TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"in the singular, while in a similar passage (St. XCI, Fourth Adventure)"
21954,TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"she is addressed by a messenger in the plural. She, however, would"
21955,TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"scarcely have uttered before Etzel the words at the close of St. LXVIII,"

21962,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,the whole body of Commentators. Von der Hagen applies to Hildebrand the
21963,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"words in the third line, _ez was im harte liet_; so does Marbach."
21964,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,Braunfels and Beta apply them to Dietrich. But in that case would not
21965,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,the author have said _dem was ez_?

21967,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"(St. IV.) The Amelungs, or Amelungers, were the reputed descendants of"
21968,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"Amala, king of the Goths, the tenth ancestor of Theodoric king of Italy."

21970,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"(St. V.) This famous hero, the redoubted Dietrich, is only a secondary"
21971,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"character in the Nibelungenlied, though in old German traditions"
21972,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,generally he bears the principal part. He was the son of a nocturnal
21973,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"spirit, and his fiery breath made him more than a match for Siegfried"
21974,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"himself, as it melted the horny hide of his antagonist. He is"
21975,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"identified, I believe, by universal consent, with Theodoric the"
21976,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"Ostrogoth. I am afraid that it is too certain that he came to a bad end,"
21977,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"but whether he disappeared on being summoned by a dwarf, or was carried"
21978,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"off by the devil in the shape of a black horse, or, according to the"
21979,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"monastic legend reported by Gibbon, was deposited by foul fiends in the"
21980,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"volcano of Libari, is more than I can decide."

21983,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"XXXII, Thirtieth Adventure."
21984,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
21985,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"(St. XXI.) Hagan's suspicions are natural enough, for Kriemhild appears"
21986,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"to have kissed nobody but Giselher, whereas, according to the etiquette"
21987,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"of this poem, she should not only have kissed her other two brothers,"
21988,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"but Hagan himself, not merely as her cousin, but as one of Gunther's"
21989,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,principal retainers.
21990,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
21991,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,(St. XXVI.) This stanza is rejected by Lachmann on account of the
21992,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"interior rhyme _wære_ and _swære_ in the third and fourth lines, but"
21993,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,surely the outbreak of Hagan in the next stanza is the beginning of a
21994,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"speech. It would have been more plausible, if St. VIII is to be"
21995,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"rejected, to reject St. XXI, Thirtieth Adventure, as well, for the first"
21996,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,line of St. XXVII would come in very well after the last of St. XXIV;
21997,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"but then, on the other hand, no answer would be given to Kriemhild's"
21998,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"question, ""Where have you that bestowed?"""

22000,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,(St. XXVII.) The two languages agree in taking the devil's name in vain
22001,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,by using it as a ludicrous but forcible negative. The phrase is
22002,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,authorized by Johnson.
22003,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
22004,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,(St. XXVIII.) Von der Hagen explains these two robberies by observing
22005,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,that Hagan had despoiled Kriemhild of her own inheritance as well as of
22006,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"the wondrous hoard. The poem itself, however, seems to explain the"
22007,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,matter somewhat differently. Hagan committed the first robbery when he
22008,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"took the hoard (St. XXXV, Nineteenth Adventure); the second, when he"
22009,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"seized Siegfried's other treasures (St. CXXXII, Twentieth Adventure)."
22010,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,
22011,TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,(St. XXXIV.) Lachmann places this and the following stanzas after St.

22016,TWENTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,
22017,TWENTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,(St. I.) Von der Hagen discovers here (v. 7055 of his Remarks) a trace
22018,TWENTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,"of the tradition (which, however, is not noticed in this poem) that"
22019,TWENTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,"Hagan had lost an eye. This appears visionary to me. At St. XVII,"
22020,TWENTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,"Thirty-second Adventure, the same words are applied to Dankwart, who"
22021,TWENTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,certainly had two eyes in his head. Twice in this poem a personal
22022,TWENTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,"description of Hagan occurs (St. XXV, Seventh Adventure, and XVII,"
22023,TWENTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,Twenty-eighth Adventure) and in neither case is a hint given that he was
22024,TWENTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,"a _dux luscus_. The author or authors of the Nibelungenlied, therefore,"
22025,TWENTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,must have followed a different tradition.

22037,TWENTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,
22038,TWENTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,(St. XLVIII.) This allusion to the future is of such a nature as to be
22039,TWENTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,irreconcilable with the notion of separate lays. The like may be said of
22040,TWENTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,many other passages.
22041,TWENTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,
22042,TWENTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,"(St. LV.) _Morat_ or _morass_, as far as I can make out from a rather"
22043,TWENTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,"confused note of von der Hagen's, was a sort of caudle, flavored with"
22044,TWENTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,"mulberry or cherry juice. Ziemann's recipe is to take old and good wine,"
22045,TWENTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,"and to mix it with mulberry syrup, rose julep, cinnamon water, and an"
22046,TWENTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,_ad libitum_ infusion of simples. All this together composes the sweet
22047,TWENTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,drink in question.

22065,THIRTIETH ADVENTURE,latter part of the poem.

22070,THIRTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,(St. I.) The whole of this Thirty-first Adventure is supposed by
22071,THIRTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,Lachmann to be an addition to the foregoing. His reasons are anything
22072,THIRTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,but conclusive.
22073,THIRTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
22074,THIRTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,(St. X.) According to von der Hagen the shields were high enough for the
22075,THIRTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"bearer to lean upon them, and pointed below, so that they might be"
22076,THIRTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"firmly fixed in the ground. They thus, I presume, in some degree"

22085,THIRTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,(St. LXIII.) Kriemhild here deals with Bloedel as Juno does in the
22086,THIRTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"Iliad with Sleep, and in the Æneid with Oeolus."
22087,THIRTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,
22088,THIRTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"(St. LXXII.) Something seems defective here, for it is not explained"
22089,THIRTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"what bad object Kriemhild had in view in sending for her son, though it"
22090,THIRTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,so happened that mischief came of it. Von der Hagen and Vollmer mention
22091,THIRTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"the account in the Vilkina Saga, according to which Kriemhild, in order"
22092,THIRTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"to set the Huns and Burgundians by the ears, told her son to strike"
22093,THIRTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"Hagan in the face, and Hagan returned the compliment by cutting off the"
22094,THIRTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"lad's head and throwing it into his mother's lap, but this is"
22095,THIRTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"incompatible with the manner in which the fighting begins in our poem,"
22096,THIRTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,though this particular stanza seems to refer to something of that sort.
22097,THIRTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,The reviser of the Lassberg manuscript seems to have observed the
22098,THIRTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,difficulty; at least the last line of the stanza is different in that
22099,THIRTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,manuscript. Possibly this stanza may have crept in from a now lost
22100,THIRTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"recension, which more nearly resembled the Vilkina Saga. The like may be"
22101,THIRTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,"said of St. IV, Thirty-second Adventure, which contains the celebrated"
22102,THIRTY-FIRST ADVENTURE,contradiction about the age of Dankwart.

22105,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE
22106,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
22107,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,(St. IV.) This stanza is completely at variance with the earlier parts
22108,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"of the poem, in which Dankwart is represented as Siegfried's companion"
22109,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,in arms. It is therefore a most efficient ally of those critics who
22110,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"attribute the poem to two or twenty different bards, and this has"
22111,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,perhaps rather blinded them to its defects. It is quite inconsistent
22112,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,with the heroic character displayed by Dankwart in this very portion of
22113,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"the poem, and, as an answer to Bloedel's speech, is a consummate piece"
22114,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,of stupidity. Bloedel had not accused Dankwart of having murdered
22115,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Siegfried or offended Kriemhild, but of being the brother of Hagan, who"
22116,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"had done both. Dankwart should either have attempted to show that Hagan,"
22117,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"not himself, was innocent, or that they were not brothers, or he should"
22118,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,have urged the hardship of making one brother suffer for the crimes of
22119,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,another. Any of these answers would have been to the purpose; not so the
22120,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"speech which is put into his mouth here. Bloedel, with equal"
22121,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"absurdity, after having already told him that he must die because his"
22122,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"brother Hagan had murdered Siegfried, now replies that he must die"
22123,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,because his _kinsmen_ Gunther and Hagan had done the deed. It appears
22124,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"probable that here, as elsewhere, a passage has crept in from another"
22125,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"version of the legend, which agreed, more nearly than our poem, with the"
22126,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,Vilkina Saga. I quote the following passage from the summary of that
22127,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"work in Vollmer's Preface to the ""Nibelunge Nôt."" ""Hogni begged Attila"
22128,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"to give peace to young Giselher, as he was guiltless of Sigurd's death."
22129,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Giselher himself said that he was then only five winters old, and slept"
22130,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,in his mother's bed; still he did not wish to live alone after the death
22131,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"of his brothers."" In the Vilkina Saga Hogni, who answers to the Hagan of"
22132,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"our poem, is represented as the _brother_ of the other three kings. It"
22133,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,may appear visionary to speculate on the contents of a poem which may
22134,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"never have existed, but certainly in any version of the legend, which"
22135,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"represented Hagan as the _brother_ of Gunther and Giselher, Giselher"
22136,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,might naturally have made the speech here put into the mouth of
22137,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"Dankwart, and have been told in reply that he must die for the crime"
22138,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,that his _brothers_ Gunther and Hagan had committed. The idea of a
22139,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,recension more nearly allied to the Vilkina Saga than that which we
22140,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,possess is no notion of mine. It was started years ago by no less a
22141,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"person than Professor W. Grimm, though not with reference to this"
22142,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"passage of the poem. See his ""Deutsche Heldensage,"" p. 182."
22143,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,
22144,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"(St. VII.) This mention of Nudung's bride, together with what follows in"
22145,THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE,"the next stanza, is quite unintelligible, if we suppose an independent"

22155,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,"(St. XXX.) With this stanza (St. 1916, L.) ends Lachmann's Eighteenth"

22157,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,could end a separate poem in this manner. Similar objections may be made
22158,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,to the conclusion of most of these _Lieder_.

22167,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,
22168,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,(St. XLV.) There certainly seems some confusion here. The only people
22169,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,who had injured Gunther in Hungary were the Huns who had massacred the
22170,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,"yeomen, and these were not present in the hall. If, on the other hand,"
22171,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,"he suspected that the Huns in the hall were privy to it, why allow Etzel"
22172,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,"and Kriemhild to depart without so much as an observation? Why, as"
22173,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,"Lachmann has observed, does not Dietrich think it necessary even to make"
22174,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,a request in their behalf? It is easy to remove these objections by
22175,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,"declaring everything spurious between St. XXX and St. XII, Thirty-fourth"
22176,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,"Adventure, but unfortunately, though St. XXIV, Twenty-eighth Adventure,"
22177,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,"which brings Etzel and Kriemhild into the hall, is not admitted into"
22178,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,"Lachmann's Lays, it is clear from stanzas XII-XIV, Thirty-third"
22179,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,"Adventure (1898-1900 L.), which form part of his Eighteenth Lay, that"
22180,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,both Etzel and Kriemhild were present in the hall when the fighting
22181,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,"began, and indeed Lachmann admits that the plan of his Eighteenth Lay"
22182,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,"requires that they should quit it. The composer however of the lay, who"
22183,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,"surely ought to know his own plan best, seems to have been of a"
22184,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,"different opinion, for, after having set the Huns and Burgundians by the"
22185,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,"ears in the hall, and put Dankwart and Volker to keep the door, he has"
22186,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,left us to guess the final result of these serious preliminary
22187,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,"arrangements. The 7,000 Huns massacred here are no doubt the same as the"
22188,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,"7,000 who accompanied Kriemhild to church at St. XX, Thirty-first"
22189,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,"Adventure, and the same perhaps as the men of Kriemhild mentioned at St."
22190,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,"XX, Thirtieth Adventure. These last had _attempted_ mischief, and"
22191,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,Gunther may here take the will for the deed.
22192,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,
22193,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,(St. LVIII.) The meaning of this stanza is anything but clear. From the
22194,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,"original, and the two readings _von_ and _vor_, it would seem doubtful"
22195,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,whether Hagan laments that he sat at a distance from Folker or that he
22196,THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE,took precedence of him.

22203,THIRTY-FOURTH ADVENTURE,"is certainly a discrepancy between the second line, in which both Hagan"

22226,THIRTY-SIXTH ADVENTURE,"(St. IX.) Here they are described as coming _ûz dem hûse_, which seems"
22227,THIRTY-SIXTH ADVENTURE,"to contradict Kriemhild's exhortation at St. XX, not to let the"
22228,THIRTY-SIXTH ADVENTURE,Burgundians come _für den sal_. Perhaps they here merely come out of the
22229,THIRTY-SIXTH ADVENTURE,"hall into a vestibule at the top of the staircase, so as to speak with"
22230,THIRTY-SIXTH ADVENTURE,"Etzel and Kriemhild, but not into the open air. So at St. V,"
22231,THIRTY-SIXTH ADVENTURE,"Thirty-ninth Adventure, Gunther and Hagan are said to be outside the"
22232,THIRTY-SIXTH ADVENTURE,"house, but at St. XXV, same Adventure, Hagan rushes down from the"
22233,THIRTY-SIXTH ADVENTURE,"staircase to attack Dietrich. From St. XXVI, Thirty-sixth Adventure, the"
22234,THIRTY-SIXTH ADVENTURE,staircase seems to have been of no great length.

22240,THIRTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
22241,THIRTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"(St. LIX.) It is odd, that the hall, which must have been the principal"
22242,THIRTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"eating-hall in the castle, is here called Kriemhild's. Von der Hagen"
22243,THIRTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,thinks Kriemhild had appropriated it by having attempted to set it on
22244,THIRTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"fire, but arson is an odd kind of title. He supposes, too, it may be the"
22245,THIRTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"hall mentioned at St. IV, Twenty-ninth Adventure; yet it seems strange"
22246,THIRTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,that Etzel should have received his guests anywhere but in his own hall.
22247,THIRTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,
22248,THIRTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"(St. XCI.) This stanza, as Professor Lachmann justly observes, cannot"
22249,THIRTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,"belong to Hagan, but is appropriate to Giselher, who is mentioned"
22250,THIRTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE,immediately after. Still there is an awkwardness here.

22260,THIRTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"Lassberg manuscript, _struchen_ for _stieben_. The latter is explained"
22261,THIRTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,by Braunfels and von der Hagen with reference to the flying out of
22262,THIRTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"sparks from armor, but this effect follows in the next line. To an"
22263,THIRTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,Englishman the reading _stieben_ appears to bear a comical resemblance
22264,THIRTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE,"to our vulgar phrase, ""dusting a man's jacket."""

22280,THIRTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,"(St. IX.) I have ventured, in conformity with the original, to talk of"

22284,THIRTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,(St. XXI.) Walter of Spain ran away with Hildegund from the court of
22285,THIRTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,"Etzel, as that monarch himself informs us in an earlier part of this"
22286,THIRTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,poem. As the young hero was passing with her through the Vosges or Wask
22287,THIRTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,"mountains, he was attacked by Gunther with twelve knights, among whom"
22288,THIRTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,"was Hagan. The latter however, ""for old acquaintance' sake,"" refused to"
22289,THIRTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,"fight against Walter, and persevered in his refusal, till the Spaniard"
22290,THIRTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,"had killed eleven knights, and Gunther himself was in danger. At last,"
22291,THIRTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,"after all three were wounded, they made up matters. According to the"
22292,THIRTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,"Vilkina Saga, Walter, after slaying the eleven knights, put Hagan to"
22293,THIRTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,"flight, and then, having lighted a fire, sat down with Hildegund to dine"
22294,THIRTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,"on the chine of a wild boar. As he was thus agreeably employed, Hagan"
22295,THIRTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,fell upon him by surprise but was pelted so severely by Walter with the
22296,THIRTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,"bones of the wild boar, that he escaped with difficulty, and, even as it"
22297,THIRTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,"was, lost an eye.--See W. Grimm's ""Deutsche Heldensage,"" p. 91."

22299,THIRTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,"The Latin poem ""Waltharius,"" which is translated from a lost German one,"
22300,THIRTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,gives a more dignified account of the matter. There also Hagano refuses
22301,THIRTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,"to fight at first, and says"

22308,THIRTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,"stronghold, where he could be attacked by only one at a time, he is"
22309,THIRTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,"assailed on his march by Gunther and Hagan, and the fight continues till"
22310,THIRTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,"Gunther has lost a foot, Walter his right hand, and Hagan his right eye"
22311,THIRTY-NINTH ADVENTURE,and twice three grinders. The combatants are then reconciled. For the
