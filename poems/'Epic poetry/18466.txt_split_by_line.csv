38,INTRODUCTION,
39,INTRODUCTION,
40,INTRODUCTION,"Virgil--Publius Vergilius Maro--was born at Andes near Mantua, in"
41,INTRODUCTION,"the year 70 B.C. His life was uneventful, though he lived in stirring"
42,INTRODUCTION,"times, and he passed by far the greater part of it in reading his"
43,INTRODUCTION,"books and writing his poems, undisturbed by the fierce civil strife"
44,INTRODUCTION,"which continued to rage throughout the Roman Empire, until Octavian,"
45,INTRODUCTION,"who afterwards became the Emperor Augustus, defeated Antony at the"
46,INTRODUCTION,"battle of Actium. Though his father was a man of humble origin, Virgil"
47,INTRODUCTION,"received an excellent education, first at Cremona and Milan, and"
48,INTRODUCTION,afterwards at Rome. He was intimate with all the distinguished men
49,INTRODUCTION,"of his time, and a personal friend of the Emperor. After the"
50,INTRODUCTION,"publication of his second work, the _Georgics_, he was recognized"
51,INTRODUCTION,"as being the greatest poet of his age, and the most striking figure"
52,INTRODUCTION,"in the brilliant circle of literary men, which was centred at the"
53,INTRODUCTION,Court. He died at Brindisi in the spring of 19 B.C. whilst returning
54,INTRODUCTION,"from a journey to Greece, leaving his greatest work, the _Aeneid_,"
55,INTRODUCTION,"written but unrevised. It was published by his executors, and"
56,INTRODUCTION,immediately took its place as the great national Epic of the Roman
57,INTRODUCTION,"people. Virgil seems to have been a man of simple, pure, and loveable"
58,INTRODUCTION,"character, and the references to him in the works of Horace clearly"
59,INTRODUCTION,show the affection with which he was regarded by his friends.
60,INTRODUCTION,
61,INTRODUCTION,"Like every cultivated Roman of that age, Virgil was a close student"
62,INTRODUCTION,"of the literature and philosophy of the Greeks, and his poems bear"
63,INTRODUCTION,eloquent testimony to the profound impression made upon him by his
64,INTRODUCTION,"reading of the Greek poets. His first important work, the _Eclogues_,"
65,INTRODUCTION,"was directly inspired by the pastoral poems of Theocritus, from whom"
66,INTRODUCTION,he borrowed not only much of his imagery but even whole lines; in
67,INTRODUCTION,"the _Georgics_ he took as his model the _Works and Days_ of Hesiod,"
68,INTRODUCTION,and though in the former case it must be confessed that he suffers
69,INTRODUCTION,"from the weakness inherent in all imitative poetry, in the latter"
70,INTRODUCTION,he far surpasses the slow and simple verses of the Boeotian. But here
71,INTRODUCTION,we must guard ourselves against a misapprehension. We moderns look
72,INTRODUCTION,askance at the writer who borrows without acknowledgment the
73,INTRODUCTION,"thoughts and phrases of his forerunners, but the Roman critics of"
74,INTRODUCTION,the Augustan Age looked at the matter from a different point of view.
75,INTRODUCTION,They regarded the Greeks as having set the standard of the highest
76,INTRODUCTION,"possible achievement in literature, and believed that it should be"
77,INTRODUCTION,"the aim of every writer to be faithful, not only to the spirit, but"
78,INTRODUCTION,even to the letter of their great exemplars. Hence it was only natural
79,INTRODUCTION,that when Virgil essayed the task of writing the national Epic of
80,INTRODUCTION,"his country, he should be studious to embody in his work all that"
81,INTRODUCTION,was best in Greek Epic poetry.
82,INTRODUCTION,
83,INTRODUCTION,It is difficult in criticizing Virgil to avoid comparing him to some
84,INTRODUCTION,"extent with Homer. But though Virgil copied Homer freely, any"
85,INTRODUCTION,"comparison between them is apt to be misleading. A primitive epic,"
86,INTRODUCTION,"like the _Iliad_ or the _Nibelungenlied_, produced by an imaginative"
87,INTRODUCTION,"people at an early stage in its development, telling its stories"
88,INTRODUCTION,"simply for the sake of story telling, cannot be judged by the same"
89,INTRODUCTION,canons of criticism as a literary epic like the _Aeneid_ or _Paradise
90,INTRODUCTION,"Lost_, which is the work of a great poet in an age of advanced culture,"
91,INTRODUCTION,and sets forth a great idea in a narrative form. The Greek writer
92,INTRODUCTION,"to whom Virgil owes most perhaps, is Apollonius of Rhodes, from whose"
93,INTRODUCTION,_Argonautica_ he borrowed the love interest of the _Aeneid_. And
94,INTRODUCTION,"though the Roman is a far greater poet, in this instance the advantage"
95,INTRODUCTION,"is by no means on his side, for, as Professor Gilbert Murray has so"
96,INTRODUCTION,"well said, 'the Medea and Jason of the _Argonautica_ are at once more"
97,INTRODUCTION,"interesting and more natural than their copies, the Dido and Aeneas"
98,INTRODUCTION,of the _Aeneid_. The wild love of the witch-maiden sits curiously
99,INTRODUCTION,on the queen and organizer of industrial Carthage; and the two
100,INTRODUCTION,qualities which form an essential part of Jason--the weakness which
101,INTRODUCTION,"makes him a traitor, and the deliberate gentleness which contrasts"
102,INTRODUCTION,him with Medea--seem incongruous in the father of Rome.' But though
103,INTRODUCTION,Virgil turned to the Greek epics for the general framework and many
104,INTRODUCTION,"of the details of his poem, he always remains master of his materials,"
105,INTRODUCTION,and stamps them with the impress of his own genius. The spirit which
106,INTRODUCTION,"inspires the _Aeneid_ is wholly Roman, and the deep faith in the"
107,INTRODUCTION,"National Destiny, and stern sense of duty to which it gives"
108,INTRODUCTION,"expression, its profoundly religious character and stately and"
109,INTRODUCTION,"melodious verse, have always caused it to be recognized as the"
110,INTRODUCTION,loftiest expression of the dignity and greatness of Rome at her best.
111,INTRODUCTION,But the sympathetic reader will be conscious of a deeper and more
112,INTRODUCTION,abiding charm in the poetry of Virgil. Even in his most splendid
113,INTRODUCTION,"passages his verses thrill us with a strange pathos, and his"
114,INTRODUCTION,sensitiveness to unseen things--things beautiful and sad--has
115,INTRODUCTION,"caused a great writer, himself a master of English prose, to speak"
116,INTRODUCTION,"of 'his single words and phrases, his pathetic half lines, giving"
117,INTRODUCTION,"utterance as the voice of Nature herself to that pain and weariness,"
118,INTRODUCTION,"yet hope of better things, which is the experience of her children"
119,INTRODUCTION,in every age.'
120,INTRODUCTION,
121,INTRODUCTION,The task of translating such a writer at all adequately may well seem
122,INTRODUCTION,to be an almost impossible one; and how far any of the numerous
123,INTRODUCTION,"attempts to do so have succeeded, is a difficult question. For not"
124,INTRODUCTION,"only does the stated ideal at which the translator should aim, vary"
125,INTRODUCTION,"with each generation, but perhaps no two lovers of Virgil would agree"
126,INTRODUCTION,at any period as to what this ideal should be. Two general principles
127,INTRODUCTION,stand out from the mass of conflicting views on this point. The
128,INTRODUCTION,"translation should read as though it were an original poem, and it"
129,INTRODUCTION,should produce on the modern reader as far as possible the same effect
130,INTRODUCTION,as the original produced on Virgil's contemporaries. And here we
131,INTRODUCTION,"reach the real difficulty, for the scholar who can alone judge what"
132,INTRODUCTION,"that effect may have been, is too intimate with the original to see"
133,INTRODUCTION,"clearly the merits of a translation, and the man who can only read"
134,INTRODUCTION,"the translation can form no opinion. However, it seems clear that"
135,INTRODUCTION,"a prose translation can never really satisfy us, because it must"
136,INTRODUCTION,always be wanting in the musical quality of continuous verse. And
137,INTRODUCTION,"our critical experience bears this out, since even Professor Mackail"
138,INTRODUCTION,with all his literary skill and insight has failed to make his version
139,INTRODUCTION,of the _Aeneid_ more than a very valuable aid to the student of the
140,INTRODUCTION,"original. The meaning of the poet is fully expressed, but his music"
141,INTRODUCTION,has been lost. That oft-quoted line--
142,INTRODUCTION,
143,INTRODUCTION,'Sunt lacrimae rerum et mentem mortalia tangunt'
144,INTRODUCTION,
145,INTRODUCTION,haunts us like Tennyson's
146,INTRODUCTION,
147,INTRODUCTION,'When unto dying eyes
148,INTRODUCTION,"The casement slowly grows a glimmering square,'"
149,INTRODUCTION,
150,INTRODUCTION,and no prose rendering can hope to convey the poignancy and pathos
151,INTRODUCTION,"of the original. The ideal translation, then, must be in verse, and"
152,INTRODUCTION,perhaps the best way for us to determine which style and metre are
153,INTRODUCTION,most suited to convey to the modern reader an impression of the charm
154,INTRODUCTION,"of Virgil, will be to take a brief glance at some of the best-known"
155,INTRODUCTION,of the verse translations which have appeared.
156,INTRODUCTION,
157,INTRODUCTION,The first translation of the _Aeneid_ into English verse was that
158,INTRODUCTION,"of Gawin Douglas, bishop of Dunkeld in Scotland, which was published"
159,INTRODUCTION,"in 1553. It is a spirited translation, marked by considerable native"
160,INTRODUCTION,"force and verisimilitude, and it was certainly unsurpassed until"
161,INTRODUCTION,that of Dryden appeared. In the best passages it renders the tone
162,INTRODUCTION,"and feeling of the original with extreme felicity--indeed, all but"
163,INTRODUCTION,perfectly. Take for instance this passage from the Sixth Book--
164,INTRODUCTION,
165,INTRODUCTION,"'Thai walking furth fa dyrk, oneth thai wyst"
166,INTRODUCTION,"Quhidder thai went, amyd dym schaddowys thar,"
167,INTRODUCTION,"Quhar evir is nycht, and nevir lyght dois repar,"
168,INTRODUCTION,"Throwout the waist dongion of Pluto Kyng,"
169,INTRODUCTION,"Thai voyd boundis, and that gowsty ryng:"
170,INTRODUCTION,Siklyke as quha wold throw thik woddis wend
171,INTRODUCTION,"In obscure licht, quhen moyn may nocht be kenned;"
172,INTRODUCTION,"As Jupiter the kyng etheryall,"
173,INTRODUCTION,With erdis skug hydis the hevynnys all
174,INTRODUCTION,"And the myrk nycht, with her vissage gray,"
175,INTRODUCTION,From every thing hes reft the hew away.'
176,INTRODUCTION,
177,INTRODUCTION,"But in spite of its merits, its dialect wearies the modern reader,"
178,INTRODUCTION,and gives it an air of grotesqueness which is very alien to the spirit
179,INTRODUCTION,of the Latin. One other sixteenth-century translation deserves
180,INTRODUCTION,"notice, as it was written by one who was himself a distinguished poet;"
181,INTRODUCTION,"namely, the version of the second and fourth books of the _Aeneid_"
182,INTRODUCTION,"written by Henry, Earl of Surrey. It gained the commendation of that"
183,INTRODUCTION,"stern critic Ascham, who praises Surrey for avoiding rhyme, but"
184,INTRODUCTION,considers that he failed to 'fully hit perfect and true versifying';
185,INTRODUCTION,which is hardly a matter for wonder since English blank verse was
186,INTRODUCTION,then in its infancy. But it has some fine passages--notably the one
187,INTRODUCTION,which relates the death of Dido--
188,INTRODUCTION,
189,INTRODUCTION,"'As she had said, her damsell might perceue"
190,INTRODUCTION,Her with these wordes fal pearced on a sword
191,INTRODUCTION,The blade embrued and hands besprent with gore.
192,INTRODUCTION,"The clamor rang unto the pallace toppe,"
193,INTRODUCTION,"The brute ranne throughout al thastoined towne,"
194,INTRODUCTION,"With wailing great, and women's shrill yelling,"
195,INTRODUCTION,"The roofs gan roare, the aire resound with plaint,"
196,INTRODUCTION,"As though Cartage, or thauncient town of Tyre"
197,INTRODUCTION,"With prease of entred enemies swarmed full,"
198,INTRODUCTION,Or when the rage of furious flame doth take
199,INTRODUCTION,"The temples toppes, and mansions eke of men.'"
200,INTRODUCTION,
201,INTRODUCTION,"Of the translations into modern English, that of Dryden may still"
202,INTRODUCTION,"be said to stand first, in spite of its lack of fidelity. It owes"
203,INTRODUCTION,"its place to its sustained vigour, and the fact that the heroic"
204,INTRODUCTION,couplet is in the hands of a master. In its way nothing could be better
205,INTRODUCTION,than--
206,INTRODUCTION,
207,INTRODUCTION,"'Just in the gate, and in the jaws of hell,"
208,INTRODUCTION,"Revengeful cares, and sullen sorrows dwell,"
209,INTRODUCTION,"And pale diseases, and repining age--"
210,INTRODUCTION,"Want, fear, and famine's unresisted rage,"
211,INTRODUCTION,"Here toils and death, and death's half-brother sleep,"
212,INTRODUCTION,"Forms terrible to view, their sentry keep."
213,INTRODUCTION,"With anxious pleasures of a guilty mind,"
214,INTRODUCTION,"Deep frauds, before, and open force behind;"
215,INTRODUCTION,"The Furies' iron beds, and strife that shakes"
216,INTRODUCTION,"Her hissing tresses, and unfolds her snakes.'"
217,INTRODUCTION,
218,INTRODUCTION,But though the heroic couplet may have conveyed to Dryden's age
219,INTRODUCTION,"something of the effect of the Virgilian hexameter, it does nothing"
220,INTRODUCTION,of the kind to us. Probably we are prejudiced in the matter by Pope's
221,INTRODUCTION,Homer.
222,INTRODUCTION,
223,INTRODUCTION,"Professor Conington's translation certainly has spirit and energy,"
224,INTRODUCTION,but he was decidedly unfortunate in his choice of metre. To attempt
225,INTRODUCTION,to render 'the stateliest measure ever moulded by the lips of man'
226,INTRODUCTION,"by fluent octosyllabics was bound to result in incongruity, as in"
227,INTRODUCTION,"the following passage, where the sombre warning of the Sibyl to"
228,INTRODUCTION,Aeneas becomes merely a sprightly reminder that--
229,INTRODUCTION,
230,INTRODUCTION,'The journey down to the abyss
231,INTRODUCTION,"Is prosperous and light,"
232,INTRODUCTION,The palace gates of gloomy Dis
233,INTRODUCTION,Stand open day and night;
234,INTRODUCTION,But upward to retrace the way
235,INTRODUCTION,"And pass into the light of day,"
236,INTRODUCTION,There comes the stress of labour; this
237,INTRODUCTION,May task a hero's might.'
238,INTRODUCTION,
239,INTRODUCTION,The various attempts that have been made to translate the poem in
240,INTRODUCTION,the metre of the original have all been sad failures. And from Richard
241,INTRODUCTION,"Stanyhurst, whom Thomas Nash described as treading 'a foul,"
242,INTRODUCTION,"lumbering, boistrous, wallowing measure, in his translation of"
243,INTRODUCTION,"Virgil,' down to our own time, no one has succeeded in avoiding faults"
244,INTRODUCTION,of monotony and lack of poetical quality. A short extract from Dr.
245,INTRODUCTION,Crane's translation will illustrate this very clearly--
246,INTRODUCTION,
247,INTRODUCTION,"'No species of hardships,"
248,INTRODUCTION,"Longer, O maiden, arises before me as strange and unlooked for:"
249,INTRODUCTION,"All things have I foreknown, and in soul have already endured them."
250,INTRODUCTION,"One special thing I crave, since here, it is said, that the gateway"
251,INTRODUCTION,"Stands of the monarch infernal, and refluent Acheron's dark pool:"
252,INTRODUCTION,Let it be mine to go down to the sight and face of my cherished
253,INTRODUCTION,"Father, and teach me the way, and the sacred avenues open.'"
254,INTRODUCTION,
255,INTRODUCTION,Nor is William Morris' attempt to devise a new metre anything but
256,INTRODUCTION,disappointing. It is surprising that so delightfully endowed a poet
257,INTRODUCTION,should have so often missed the music of Virgil's verse as he has
258,INTRODUCTION,"done in his translation, and the archaisms with which his work"
259,INTRODUCTION,"abounds, though they might be suitable in a translation of Homer,"
260,INTRODUCTION,are only a source of irritation in the case of Virgil.
261,INTRODUCTION,
262,INTRODUCTION,For the best metre to use we must look in a different direction.
263,INTRODUCTION,Virgil made use of the dactylic hexameter because it was the literary
264,INTRODUCTION,tradition of his day that epics should be written in that metre. In
265,INTRODUCTION,"the same way it might be argued, the English tradition points to blank"
266,INTRODUCTION,"verse as the correct medium. This may be so, but its use demands that"
267,INTRODUCTION,the translator should be as great a poet as Virgil. Had Tennyson ever
268,INTRODUCTION,"translated the _Aeneid_, it would doubtless have been as nearly"
269,INTRODUCTION,"faultless as any translation could be, as is shown by the version"
270,INTRODUCTION,"of Sir Theodore Martin, which owes so much of its stately charm to"
271,INTRODUCTION,its close adherence to the manner of Tennyson. A typical passage is
272,INTRODUCTION,the description of Dido's love for Aeneas--
273,INTRODUCTION,
274,INTRODUCTION,"'Soothsayers, ah! how little do they know!"
275,INTRODUCTION,"Of what avail are temples, vows, and prayers,"
276,INTRODUCTION,To quell a raging passion? All the while
277,INTRODUCTION,"A subtle flame is smouldering in her veins,"
278,INTRODUCTION,And in her heart a silent aching wound.
279,INTRODUCTION,
280,INTRODUCTION,*       *       *       *       *
281,INTRODUCTION,
282,INTRODUCTION,Now Dido leads
283,INTRODUCTION,"Aeneas round the ramparts, to him shows"
284,INTRODUCTION,"The wealth of Sidon, all the town laid out,"
285,INTRODUCTION,"Begins to speak, then stops, she knows not why."
286,INTRODUCTION,"Now, as day wanes, the feast of yesterday"
287,INTRODUCTION,"She gives again, again with fevered lips"
288,INTRODUCTION,"Begs for the tale of Troy and all its woes,"
289,INTRODUCTION,"And hangs upon his lips, who tells the tale."
290,INTRODUCTION,"Then, when the guests are gone and in her turn"
291,INTRODUCTION,"The wan moon pales her light, and waning stars"
292,INTRODUCTION,"Persuade to sleep, she in her empty halls"
293,INTRODUCTION,"Mourns all alone, and throws herself along"
294,INTRODUCTION,The couch where he had lain: though he be gone
295,INTRODUCTION,"Far from her side, she hears and sees him still.'"
296,INTRODUCTION,
297,INTRODUCTION,Of the merits of the present translation the reader will judge for
298,INTRODUCTION,himself; but it may perhaps be said of the usual objections urged
299,INTRODUCTION,"against the Spenserian stanza--that it is cumbrous and monotonous,"
300,INTRODUCTION,and presents difficulties of construction--that the two former
301,INTRODUCTION,"criticisms will be just or the reverse, according to the skill of"
302,INTRODUCTION,"the writer, while it is quite possible that the last is really an"
303,INTRODUCTION,"advantage, for the intricate machinery imposes a restraint on"
304,INTRODUCTION,"careless or hasty composition. And finally we must turn a deaf ear,"
305,INTRODUCTION,"even to so high an authority as Matthew Arnold, when he says that"
306,INTRODUCTION,it is not suited to the grand manner. When he said this he cannot
307,INTRODUCTION,have remembered either the lament of Florimell in the _Faerie Queene_
308,INTRODUCTION,or the conclusion of _Childe Harold_.

315,J. P. MAINE.,"Edward Fairfax Taylor, whose translation of the _Aeneid_ is now"
316,J. P. MAINE.,"published, was descended from the Taylors of Norwich, a family well"
317,J. P. MAINE.,known for their culture and intellectual gifts. He was the only son
318,J. P. MAINE.,"of John Edward Taylor, himself an accomplished German and Italian"
319,J. P. MAINE.,"scholar, and the first translator of the _Pentamerone_ into English,"
320,J. P. MAINE.,"who lived at Weybridge near his aunt, Mrs. Sarah Austin. Brought up"
321,J. P. MAINE.,"among books, young Taylor early showed an intense love for classical"
322,J. P. MAINE.,"literature, and soon after going to Marlborough he began the present"
323,J. P. MAINE.,translation as a boy of sixteen. His admiration for Spenser led him
324,J. P. MAINE.,"to adopt the Spenserian stanza, and in the preface to his translation"
325,J. P. MAINE.,of the first two books he gives detailed reasons for considering it
326,J. P. MAINE.,peculiarly well adapted for the _Aeneid_. He was a favourite pupil
327,J. P. MAINE.,"of the late Dr. Bradley, Dean of Westminster, at that time headmaster"
328,J. P. MAINE.,"of Marlborough, and who much wished that he should follow in the"
329,J. P. MAINE.,"footsteps of 'that brilliant band of Marlborough men,' as they have"
330,J. P. MAINE.,"been called, who at that time, year after year, gained the Balliol"
331,J. P. MAINE.,"scholarship. But circumstances made him decide otherwise, and in"
332,J. P. MAINE.,1865 he passed the necessary examination for a clerkship in the House
333,J. P. MAINE.,of Lords. The long vacations gave him time to continue this labour
334,J. P. MAINE.,"of love, and in the intervals of much other literary work, and in"
335,J. P. MAINE.,"spite of ill health, he completed the translation of the twelve books"
336,J. P. MAINE.,of the _Aeneid_. He looked forward to re-editing it and bringing it
337,J. P. MAINE.,"out when he should have retired from his work in the House of Lords,"
338,J. P. MAINE.,"but this day never came, and he died from heart disease in January"
339,J. P. MAINE.,"1902. His was a singularly charming disposition, and he was beloved"
340,J. P. MAINE.,by all who knew him; while the courage and patience with which he
341,J. P. MAINE.,"bore ever-increasing suffering, and the stoicism he showed in"
342,J. P. MAINE.,"fulfilling his duties in the House of Lords, have left a deep"
343,J. P. MAINE.,impression on all his friends.

396,ARGUMENT,
397,ARGUMENT,"Fate sends AEneas to Latium to found Rome, but Juno's hostility long"
398,ARGUMENT,delays his success (1-45). Descrying him and his Trojans in sight
399,ARGUMENT,"of Italy, she bribes AEolus to raise a storm for their destruction"
400,ARGUMENT,(46-99). The tempest (100-116). The despair of AEneas (117-126). One
401,ARGUMENT,"Trojan ship is already lost, when Neptune learns the plot and lays"
402,ARGUMENT,"the storm (127-189). AEneas escapes, lands in Libya, and heartens"
403,ARGUMENT,"his men (190-261). Venus appeals to Jupiter, who comforts her with"
404,ARGUMENT,assurance that AEneas shall yet be great in Italy. His son shall found
405,ARGUMENT,"Alba and his son's sons Rome. Juno shall eventually relent, and Rome"
406,ARGUMENT,under Augustus shall be empress of the world (262-351). Mercury is
407,ARGUMENT,"sent to secure from Dido, Queen of Libya, a welcome for AEneas. AEneas"
408,ARGUMENT,"and Achates, while reconnoitring, meet Venus in the forest disguised"
409,ARGUMENT,as a nymph. She tells them Dido's story. AEneas in reply bewails his
410,ARGUMENT,"own troubles, but is interrupted with promises of success. Let him"
411,ARGUMENT,"but persist, all will be well (352-478). Venus changes before their"
412,ARGUMENT,"eyes from nymph to goddess, and vanishes before AEneas can utter his"
413,ARGUMENT,"reproaches. Hidden in a magic mist, the pair approach Carthage, which"
414,ARGUMENT,"they find still building. They reach the citadel unobserved, and are"
415,ARGUMENT,encouraged on seeing pictures of scenes from the Trojan war (479-576).
416,ARGUMENT,"Dido appears and takes her state. To her enter, as suppliants, Trojan"
417,ARGUMENT,"leaders, whom AEneas had imagined dead. Ilioneus, their spokesman,"
418,ARGUMENT,"tells the story of the storm and asks help. ""If only AEneas were"
419,ARGUMENT,"here!"" (577-661). Dido speaks him fair and echoes his words, ""If"
420,ARGUMENT,"AEneas were here!"" The mist scatters. AEneas appears; thanks Dido,"
421,ARGUMENT,and greets Ilioneus (662-723). Dido welcomes AEneas to Carthage and
422,ARGUMENT,prepares a festival in his honour. AEneas sends Achates to summon
423,ARGUMENT,"his son and bring gifts for Dido (724-774). Cupid, persuaded by Venus"
424,ARGUMENT,"to personate Ascanius and inspire Dido with love for AEneas, comes"
425,ARGUMENT,"with the gifts to Dido's palace, while Ascanius is carried away to"
426,ARGUMENT,Idalia. The night is passed in feasting. After the feast Iopas sings
427,ARGUMENT,"the wonders of the firmament, and Dido, bewitched by Cupid, begs"
428,ARGUMENT,AEneas to tell the whole story of his adventures (775-891).
429,ARGUMENT,
430,ARGUMENT,
431,ARGUMENT,"I.  Of arms I sing, and of the man, whom Fate"
432,ARGUMENT,First drove from Troy to the Lavinian shore.
433,ARGUMENT,"Full many an evil, through the mindful hate"
434,ARGUMENT,"Of cruel Juno, from the gods he bore,"
435,ARGUMENT,"Much tost on earth and ocean, yea, and more"
436,ARGUMENT,"In war enduring, ere he built a home,"
437,ARGUMENT,And his loved household-deities brought o'er
438,ARGUMENT,"To Latium, whence the Latin people come,"
439,ARGUMENT,"Whence rose the Alban sires, and walls of lofty Rome."
440,ARGUMENT,
441,ARGUMENT,"II. O Muse, assist me and inspire my song,"
442,ARGUMENT,"The various causes and the crimes relate,"
443,ARGUMENT,"For what affronted majesty, what wrong"
444,ARGUMENT,"To injured Godhead, what offence so great"
445,ARGUMENT,"Heaven's Queen resenting, with remorseless hate,"
446,ARGUMENT,Could one renowned for piety compel
447,ARGUMENT,"To brave such troubles, and endure the weight"
448,ARGUMENT,Of toils so many and so huge. O tell
449,ARGUMENT,How can in heavenly minds such fierce resentment dwell?
450,ARGUMENT,
451,ARGUMENT,"III. There stood a city, fronting far away"
452,ARGUMENT,"The mouths of Tiber and Italia's shore,"
453,ARGUMENT,"A Tyrian settlement of olden day,"
454,ARGUMENT,"Rich in all wealth, and trained to war's rough lore,"
455,ARGUMENT,"Carthage the name, by Juno loved before"
456,ARGUMENT,"All places, even Samos. Here were shown"
457,ARGUMENT,"Her arms, and here her chariot; evermore"
458,ARGUMENT,"E'en then this land she cherished as her own,"
459,ARGUMENT,"And here, should Fate permit, had planned a world-wide throne."
460,ARGUMENT,
461,ARGUMENT,"IV. But she had heard, how men of Trojan seed"
462,ARGUMENT,"Those Tyrian towers should level, how again"
463,ARGUMENT,"From these in time a nation should proceed,"
464,ARGUMENT,"Wide-ruling, tyrannous in war, the bane"
465,ARGUMENT,(So Fate was working) of the Libyan reign.
466,ARGUMENT,"This feared she, mindful of the war beside"
467,ARGUMENT,Waged for her Argives on the Trojan plain;
468,ARGUMENT,Nor even yet had from her memory died
469,ARGUMENT,"The causes of her wrath, the pangs of wounded pride,--"
470,ARGUMENT,
471,ARGUMENT,"V.  The choice of Paris, and her charms disdained,"
472,ARGUMENT,"The hateful race, the lawless honours ta'en"
473,ARGUMENT,By ravished Ganymede--these wrongs remained.
474,ARGUMENT,"So fired with rage, the Trojans' scanty train"
475,ARGUMENT,By fierce Achilles and the Greeks unslain
476,ARGUMENT,"She barred from Latium, and in evil strait"
477,ARGUMENT,"For many a year, on many a distant main"
478,ARGUMENT,"They wandered, homeless outcasts, tost by Fate;"
479,ARGUMENT,"So huge, so hard the task to found the Roman state."
480,ARGUMENT,
481,ARGUMENT,"VI. Scarce out of sight of Sicily, they set"
482,ARGUMENT,"Their sails to sea, and merrily ploughed the main,"
483,ARGUMENT,"With brazen beaks, when Juno, harbouring yet"
484,ARGUMENT,"Within her breast the ever-rankling pain,"
485,ARGUMENT,"Mused thus: ""Must I then from the work refrain,"
486,ARGUMENT,"Nor keep this Trojan from the Latin throne,"
487,ARGUMENT,"Baffled, forsooth, because the Fates constrain?"
488,ARGUMENT,"Could Pallas burn the Grecian fleet, and drown"
489,ARGUMENT,"Their crews, for one man's crime, Oileus' frenzied son?"
490,ARGUMENT,
491,ARGUMENT,"VII. ""She, hurling Jove's winged lightning, stirred the deep"
492,ARGUMENT,"And strewed the ships. Him, from his riven breast"
493,ARGUMENT,"The flames outgasping, with a whirlwind's sweep"
494,ARGUMENT,She caught and fixed upon a rock's sharp crest.
495,ARGUMENT,"But I, who walk the Queen of Heaven confessed,"
496,ARGUMENT,"Jove's sister-spouse, shall I forevermore"
497,ARGUMENT,With one poor tribe keep warring without rest?
498,ARGUMENT,Who then henceforth shall Juno's power adore?
499,ARGUMENT,"Who then her fanes frequent, her deity implore?"""
500,ARGUMENT,
501,ARGUMENT,"VIII. Such thoughts revolving in her fiery mind,"
502,ARGUMENT,"Straightway the Goddess to AEolia passed,"
503,ARGUMENT,"The storm-clouds' birthplace, big with blustering wind."
504,ARGUMENT,Here AEolus within a dungeon vast
505,ARGUMENT,The sounding tempest and the struggling blast
506,ARGUMENT,Bends to his sway and bridles them with chains.
507,ARGUMENT,"They, in the rock reverberant held fast,"
508,ARGUMENT,"Moan at the doors. Here, throned aloft, he reigns;"
509,ARGUMENT,"His sceptre calms their rage, their violence restrains:"
510,ARGUMENT,
511,ARGUMENT,IX. Else earth and sea and all the firmament
512,ARGUMENT,The winds together through the void would sweep.
513,ARGUMENT,"But, fearing this, the Sire omnipotent"
514,ARGUMENT,"Hath buried them in caverns dark and deep,"
515,ARGUMENT,"And o'er them piled huge mountains in a heap,"
516,ARGUMENT,"And set withal a monarch, there to reign,"
517,ARGUMENT,By compact taught at his command to keep
518,ARGUMENT,"Strict watch, and tighten or relax the rein."
519,ARGUMENT,"Him now Saturnia sought, and thus in lowly strain:"
520,ARGUMENT,
521,ARGUMENT,"X.  ""O AEolus, for Jove, of human kind"
522,ARGUMENT,"And Gods the sovran Sire, hath given to thee"
523,ARGUMENT,"To lull the waves and lift them with the wind,"
524,ARGUMENT,"A hateful people, enemies to me,"
525,ARGUMENT,"Their ships are steering o'er the Tuscan sea,"
526,ARGUMENT,Bearing their Troy and vanquished gods away
527,ARGUMENT,"To Italy. Go, set the storm-winds free,"
528,ARGUMENT,"And sink their ships or scatter them astray,"
529,ARGUMENT,"And strew their corpses forth, to weltering waves a prey."
530,ARGUMENT,
531,ARGUMENT,"XI. ""Twice seven nymphs have I, beautiful to see;"
532,ARGUMENT,"One, Deiopeia, fairest of the fair,"
533,ARGUMENT,"In lasting wedlock will I link to thee,"
534,ARGUMENT,"Thy life-long years for such deserts to share,"
535,ARGUMENT,"And make thee parent of an offspring fair.""--"
536,ARGUMENT,"""Speak, Queen,"" he answered, ""to obey is mine."
537,ARGUMENT,To thee I owe this sceptre and whate'er
538,ARGUMENT,"Of realm is here; thou makest Jove benign,"
539,ARGUMENT,"Thou giv'st to rule the storms and sit at feasts divine."""
540,ARGUMENT,
541,ARGUMENT,"XII. So spake the God and with her hest complied,"
542,ARGUMENT,And turned the massive sceptre in his hand
543,ARGUMENT,And pushed the hollow mountain on its side.
544,ARGUMENT,"Out rushed the winds, like soldiers in a band,"
545,ARGUMENT,"In wedged array, and, whirling, scour the land."
546,ARGUMENT,"East, West and squally South-west, with a roar,"
547,ARGUMENT,"Swoop down on Ocean, and the surf and sand"
548,ARGUMENT,"Mix in dark eddies, and the watery floor"
549,ARGUMENT,"Heave from its depths, and roll huge billows to the shore."
550,ARGUMENT,
551,ARGUMENT,XIII. Then come the creak of cables and the cries
552,ARGUMENT,"Of seamen. Clouds the darkened heavens have drowned,"
553,ARGUMENT,And snatched the daylight from the Trojans' eyes.
554,ARGUMENT,Black night broods on the waters; all around
555,ARGUMENT,From pole to pole the rattling peals resound
556,ARGUMENT,And frequent flashes light the lurid air.
557,ARGUMENT,"All nature, big with instant ruin, frowned"
558,ARGUMENT,Destruction. Then AEneas' limbs with fear
559,ARGUMENT,"Were loosened, and he groaned and stretched his hands in prayer:"
560,ARGUMENT,
561,ARGUMENT,"XIV. ""Thrice, four times blest, who, in their fathers' face"
562,ARGUMENT,Fell by the walls of Ilion far away!
563,ARGUMENT,"O son of Tydeus, bravest of the race,"
564,ARGUMENT,"Why could not I have perished, too, that day"
565,ARGUMENT,"Beneath thine arm, and breathed this soul away"
566,ARGUMENT,"Far on the plains of Troy, where Hector brave"
567,ARGUMENT,"Lay, pierced by fierce AEacides, where lay"
568,ARGUMENT,"Giant Sarpedon, and swift Simois' wave"
569,ARGUMENT,"Rolls heroes, helms and shields, whelmed in one watery grave?"""
570,ARGUMENT,
571,ARGUMENT,"XV. E'en as he cried, the hurricane from the North"
572,ARGUMENT,Struck with a roar against the sail. Up leap
573,ARGUMENT,The waves to heaven; the shattered oars start forth;
574,ARGUMENT,"Round swings the prow, and lets the waters sweep"
575,ARGUMENT,The broadside. Onward comes a mountain heap
576,ARGUMENT,"Of billows, gaunt, abrupt. These, horsed astride"
577,ARGUMENT,"A surge's crest, rock pendent o'er the deep;"
578,ARGUMENT,"To those the wave's huge hollow, yawning wide,"
579,ARGUMENT,Lays bare the ground below; dark swells the sandy tide.
580,ARGUMENT,
581,ARGUMENT,XVI. Three ships the South-wind catching hurls away
582,ARGUMENT,"On hidden rocks, which (Latins from of yore"
583,ARGUMENT,"Have called them ""Altars"") in mid ocean lay,"
584,ARGUMENT,A huge ridge level with the tide. Three more
585,ARGUMENT,Fierce Eurus from the deep sea dashed ashore
586,ARGUMENT,"On quicks and shallows, pitiful to view,"
587,ARGUMENT,"And round them heaped the sandbanks. One, that bore"
588,ARGUMENT,"The brave Orontes and his Lycian crew,"
589,ARGUMENT,Full in AEneas' sight a toppling wave o'erthrew.
590,ARGUMENT,
591,ARGUMENT,"XVII. Dashed from the tiller, down the pilot rolled."
592,ARGUMENT,"Thrice round the billow whirled her, as she lay,"
593,ARGUMENT,Then whelmed below. Strewn here and there behold
594,ARGUMENT,"Arms, planks, lone swimmers in the surges grey,"
595,ARGUMENT,And treasures snatched from Trojan homes away.
596,ARGUMENT,Now fail the ships wherein Achates ride
597,ARGUMENT,"And Abas; old Aletes' bark gives way,"
598,ARGUMENT,And brave Ilioneus'. Each loosened side
599,ARGUMENT,Through many a gaping seam lets in the baleful tide.
600,ARGUMENT,
601,ARGUMENT,"XVIII. Meanwhile great Neptune, sore amazed, perceived"
602,ARGUMENT,"The storm let loose, the turmoil of the sky,"
603,ARGUMENT,And ocean from its lowest depths upheaved.
604,ARGUMENT,"With calm brow lifted o'er the sea, his eye"
605,ARGUMENT,"Beholds Troy's navy scattered far and nigh,"
606,ARGUMENT,And by the waves and ruining heaven oppressed
607,ARGUMENT,The Trojan crews. Nor failed he to espy
608,ARGUMENT,His sister's wiles and hatred. East and West
609,ARGUMENT,"He summoned to his throne, and thus his wrath expressed."
610,ARGUMENT,
611,ARGUMENT,"XIX. ""What pride of birth possessed you, Earth and air"
612,ARGUMENT,"Without my leave to mingle in affray,"
613,ARGUMENT,And raise such hubbub in my realm? Beware--
614,ARGUMENT,Yet first 'twere best these billows to allay.
615,ARGUMENT,Far other coin hereafter ye shall pay
616,ARGUMENT,"For crimes like these. Presumptuous winds, begone,"
617,ARGUMENT,"And take your king this message, that the sway"
618,ARGUMENT,Of Ocean and the sceptre and the throne
619,ARGUMENT,"Fate gave to me, not him; the trident is my own."
620,ARGUMENT,
621,ARGUMENT,"XX. ""He holds huge rocks; these, Eurus, are for thee,"
622,ARGUMENT,"There let him glory in his hall and reign,"
623,ARGUMENT,"But keep his winds close prisoners."" Thus he,"
624,ARGUMENT,"And, ere his speech was ended, smoothed the main,"
625,ARGUMENT,And chased the clouds and brought the sun again.
626,ARGUMENT,"Triton, Cymothoe from the rock's sharp brow"
627,ARGUMENT,Push off the vessels. Neptune plies amain
628,ARGUMENT,"His trident-lever, lays the sandbanks low,"
629,ARGUMENT,"On light wheels shaves the deep, and calms the billowy flow."
630,ARGUMENT,
631,ARGUMENT,XXI. As when in mighty multitudes bursts out
632,ARGUMENT,"Sedition, and the wrathful rabble rave;"
633,ARGUMENT,"Rage finds them arms; stones, firebrands fly about,"
634,ARGUMENT,"Then if some statesman reverend and grave,"
635,ARGUMENT,"Stand forth conspicuous, and the tumult brave"
636,ARGUMENT,"All, hushed, attend; his guiding words restrain"
637,ARGUMENT,"Their angry wills; so sank the furious wave,"
638,ARGUMENT,"When through the clear sky looking o'er the main,"
639,ARGUMENT,The sea-king lashed his steeds and slacked the favouring rein.
640,ARGUMENT,
641,ARGUMENT,"XXII. Tired out, the Trojans seek the nearest land"
642,ARGUMENT,And turn to Libya.--In a far retreat
643,ARGUMENT,There lies a haven; towards the deep doth stand
644,ARGUMENT,"An island, on whose jutting headlands beat"
645,ARGUMENT,"The broken billows, shivered into sleet."
646,ARGUMENT,"Two towering crags, twin giants, guard the cove,"
647,ARGUMENT,And threat the skies. The waters at their feet
648,ARGUMENT,"Sleep hushed, and, like a curtain, frowns above,"
649,ARGUMENT,"Mixt with the glancing green, the darkness of the grove."
650,ARGUMENT,
651,ARGUMENT,"XXIII. Beneath a precipice, that fronts the wave,"
652,ARGUMENT,"With limpid springs inside, and many a seat"
653,ARGUMENT,"Of living marble, lies a sheltered cave,"
654,ARGUMENT,Home of the Sea-Nymphs. In this haven sweet
655,ARGUMENT,Cable nor biting anchor moors the fleet.
656,ARGUMENT,"Here with seven ships, the remnant of his band,"
657,ARGUMENT,AEneas enters. Glad at length to greet
658,ARGUMENT,"The welcome earth, the Trojans leap to land,"
659,ARGUMENT,And lay their weary limbs still dripping on the sand.
660,ARGUMENT,
661,ARGUMENT,"XXIV. First from a flint a spark Achates drew,"
662,ARGUMENT,And lit the leaves and dry wood heaped with care
663,ARGUMENT,"And set the fuel flaming, as he blew."
664,ARGUMENT,"Then, tired of toiling, from the ships they bear"
665,ARGUMENT,"The sea-spoiled corn, and Ceres' tools prepare,"
666,ARGUMENT,And 'twixt the millstones grind the rescued grain
667,ARGUMENT,And roast the pounded morsels for their fare:
668,ARGUMENT,"While up the crag AEneas climbs, to gain"
669,ARGUMENT,"Full prospect far and wide, and scan the distant main."
670,ARGUMENT,
671,ARGUMENT,XXV. If aught of Phrygian biremes he discern
672,ARGUMENT,"Antheus or Capys, tost upon the seas,"
673,ARGUMENT,Or arms of brave Caicus high astern.
674,ARGUMENT,"No sail, but wandering on the shore he sees"
675,ARGUMENT,"Three stags, and, grazing up the vale at ease,"
676,ARGUMENT,The whole herd troops behind them in a row.
677,ARGUMENT,"He stops, and from Achates hastes to seize"
678,ARGUMENT,"His chance-brought arms, the arrows and the bow,"
679,ARGUMENT,"The branching antlers smites, and lays the leader low."
680,ARGUMENT,
681,ARGUMENT,XXVI. Next fall the herd; and through the leafy glade
682,ARGUMENT,"In mingled rout he drives the scattered train,"
683,ARGUMENT,"Plying his shafts, nor stays his conquering raid"
684,ARGUMENT,"Till seven huge bodies on the ground lie slain,"
685,ARGUMENT,The number of his vessels; then again
686,ARGUMENT,"He seeks the crews, and gives a deer to each,"
687,ARGUMENT,"Then opes the casks, which good Acestes, fain"
688,ARGUMENT,"At parting, filled on the Trinacrian beach,"
689,ARGUMENT,"And shares the wine, and soothes their drooping hearts with speech."
690,ARGUMENT,
691,ARGUMENT,"XXVII. ""Comrades! of ills not ignorant; far more"
692,ARGUMENT,"Than these ye suffered, and to these as well"
693,ARGUMENT,"Will Jove give ending, as he gave before."
694,ARGUMENT,"Ye know mad Scylla, and her monsters' yell,"
695,ARGUMENT,And the dark caverns where the Cyclops dwell.
696,ARGUMENT,"Fear not; take heart; hereafter, it may be"
697,ARGUMENT,These too will yield a pleasant tale to tell.
698,ARGUMENT,"Through shifting hazards, by the Fates' decree,"
699,ARGUMENT,"To Latin shores we steer, our promised land to see."
700,ARGUMENT,
701,ARGUMENT,"XXVIII. ""There quiet settlements the Fates display,"
702,ARGUMENT,There Troy her ruined fortunes shall repair.
703,ARGUMENT,"Bear up; reserve you for a happier day."""
704,ARGUMENT,"He spake, and heart-sick with a load of care,"
705,ARGUMENT,"Suppressed his grief, and feigned a cheerful air."
706,ARGUMENT,All straightway gird them to the feast. These flay
707,ARGUMENT,"The ribs and thighs, and lay the entrails bare."
708,ARGUMENT,"Those slice the flesh, and split the quivering prey,"
709,ARGUMENT,And tend the fires and set the cauldrons in array.
710,ARGUMENT,
711,ARGUMENT,"XXIX. So wine and venison, to their hearts' desire,"
712,ARGUMENT,"Refreshed their strength. And when the feast was sped,"
713,ARGUMENT,"Their missing friends in converse they require,"
714,ARGUMENT,"Doubtful to deem them, betwixt hope and dread,"
715,ARGUMENT,Alive or out of hearing with the dead.
716,ARGUMENT,"All mourned, but good AEneas mourned the most,"
717,ARGUMENT,"And bitter tears for Amycus he shed,"
718,ARGUMENT,"Gyas, Cloanthus, bravest of his host,"
719,ARGUMENT,"Lycus, Orontes bold, all counted with the lost."
720,ARGUMENT,
721,ARGUMENT,"XXX. Now came an end of mourning and of woe,"
722,ARGUMENT,"When Jove, surveying from his prospect high"
723,ARGUMENT,"Shore, sail-winged sea, and peopled earth below,"
724,ARGUMENT,"Stood, musing, on the summit of the sky,"
725,ARGUMENT,"And on the Libyan kingdom fixed his eye,"
726,ARGUMENT,"To him, such cares revolving in his breast,"
727,ARGUMENT,"Her shining eyes suffused with tears, came nigh"
728,ARGUMENT,"Fair Venus, for her darling son distrest,"
729,ARGUMENT,And thus in sorrowing tones the Sire of heaven addressed;
730,ARGUMENT,
731,ARGUMENT,"XXXI. ""O Thou, whose nod and awful bolts attest"
732,ARGUMENT,"O'er Gods and men thine everlasting reign,"
733,ARGUMENT,"Wherein hath my AEneas so transgressed,"
734,ARGUMENT,"Wherein his Trojans, thus to mourn their slain,"
735,ARGUMENT,"Barred from the world, lest Italy they gain?"
736,ARGUMENT,Surely from them the rolling years should see
737,ARGUMENT,"New sons of ancient Teucer rise again,"
738,ARGUMENT,"The Romans, rulers of the land and sea."
739,ARGUMENT,"So swar'st thou; Father, say, why changed is thy decree?"
740,ARGUMENT,
741,ARGUMENT,"XXXII. ""That word consoled me, weighing fate with fate,"
742,ARGUMENT,"For Troy's sad fall. Now Fortune, as before,"
743,ARGUMENT,Pursues the woe-worn victims of her hate.
744,ARGUMENT,"O when, great Monarch, shall their toil be o'er?"
745,ARGUMENT,Safe could Antenor pass th' Illyrian shore
746,ARGUMENT,"Through Danaan hosts, and realms Liburnian gain,"
747,ARGUMENT,"And climb Timavus and her springs explore,"
748,ARGUMENT,"Where through nine mouths, with roaring surge, the main"
749,ARGUMENT,Bursts from the sounding rocks and deluges the plain.
750,ARGUMENT,
751,ARGUMENT,"XXXIII. ""Yet there he built Patavium, yea, and named"
752,ARGUMENT,"The nation, and the Trojan arms laid down,"
753,ARGUMENT,And now rests happy in the town he framed.
754,ARGUMENT,"But we, thy progeny, to whom alone"
755,ARGUMENT,"Thy nod hath promised a celestial throne,"
756,ARGUMENT,"Our vessels lost, from Italy are barred,"
757,ARGUMENT,O shame! and ruined for the wrath of one.
758,ARGUMENT,"Thus, thus dost thou thy plighted word regard,"
759,ARGUMENT,"Our sceptred realms restore, our piety reward?"""
760,ARGUMENT,
761,ARGUMENT,"XXXIV. Then Jove, soft-smiling with the look that clears"
762,ARGUMENT,"The storms, and gently kissing her, replies;"
763,ARGUMENT,"""Firm are thy fates, sweet daughter; spare thy fears."
764,ARGUMENT,"Thou yet shalt see Lavinium's walls arise,"
765,ARGUMENT,And bear thy brave AEneas to the skies.
766,ARGUMENT,"My purpose shifts not. Now, to ease thy woes,"
767,ARGUMENT,"Since sorrow for his sake hath dimmed thine eyes,"
768,ARGUMENT,"More will I tell, and hidden fates disclose."
769,ARGUMENT,"He in Italia long shall battle with his foes,"
770,ARGUMENT,
771,ARGUMENT,"XXXV. ""And crush fierce tribes, and milder ways ordain,"
772,ARGUMENT,"And cities build and wield the Latin sway,"
773,ARGUMENT,"Till the third summer shall have seen him reign,"
774,ARGUMENT,And three long winter-seasons passed away
775,ARGUMENT,Since fierce Rutulia did his arms obey.
776,ARGUMENT,"Then, too, the boy Ascanius, named of late"
777,ARGUMENT,Iulus--Ilus was he in the day
778,ARGUMENT,When firm by royalty stood Ilium's state--
779,ARGUMENT,Shall rule till thirty years complete the destined date.
780,ARGUMENT,
781,ARGUMENT,"XXXVI. ""He from Lavinium shall remove his seat,"
782,ARGUMENT,And gird Long Alba for defence; and there
783,ARGUMENT,'Neath Hector's kin three hundred years complete

785,ARGUMENT,"Queen-priestess, twins by Mars' embrace shall bear."
786,ARGUMENT,"Then Romulus the nation's charge shall claim,"
787,ARGUMENT,"Wolf-nursed and proud her tawny hide to wear,"
788,ARGUMENT,"And build a city of Mavortian fame,"
789,ARGUMENT,And make the Roman race remembered by his name.
790,ARGUMENT,
791,ARGUMENT,"XXXVII. ""To these no period nor appointed date,"
792,ARGUMENT,Nor bounds to their dominion I assign;
793,ARGUMENT,An endless empire shall the race await.
794,ARGUMENT,"Nay, Juno, too, who now, in mood malign,"
795,ARGUMENT,"Earth, sea and sky is harrying, shall incline"
796,ARGUMENT,"To better counsels, and unite with me"
797,ARGUMENT,"To cherish and uphold the imperial line,"
798,ARGUMENT,"The Romans, rulers of the land and sea,"
799,ARGUMENT,Lords of the flowing gown. So standeth my decree.
800,ARGUMENT,
801,ARGUMENT,"XXXVIII. ""In rolling ages there shall come the day"

1429,ARGUMENT,"AEneas' story.--The Greeks, baffled in battle, built a wooden horse,"
1430,ARGUMENT,in which their leaders took ambush. Their fleet sailed to Tenedos.
1431,ARGUMENT,"The Trojans, but for Capys and Laocoon, had dragged the horse"
1432,ARGUMENT,"forthwith as a trophy into Troy (1-72). Sinon, a Greek, brought"
1433,ARGUMENT,"before Priam, feigns righteous indignation against Greece. The"
1434,ARGUMENT,Trojans sympathise and believe his story of wrongs done him by
1435,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses (73-126). ""When Greek plans of flight had often,"" says Sinon,"
1436,ARGUMENT,"""been foiled by storms, oracles foretold that only a human sacrifice"
1437,ARGUMENT,"could purchase their escape."" Chosen for victim, Sinon had fled. He"

1439,ARGUMENT,"it, and you are lost. Preserve it in your citadel, your revenge is"
1440,ARGUMENT,"assured"" (127-222). Treachery triumphs. Laocoon's cruel fate is"
1441,ARGUMENT,"ascribed to his sacrilegious attack upon the horse, which is brought"
1442,ARGUMENT,"with rejoicing into Troy, despite a last warning, from Cassandra"
1443,ARGUMENT,"(223-288). While Troy sleeps, the fleet returns, and Sinon releases"
1444,ARGUMENT,the Greeks from the horse (289-315). Hector's wraith warns AEneas
1445,ARGUMENT,"in a dream to flee with the sacred vessels and images (316-351), and"
1446,ARGUMENT,Panthus brings news of Sinon's treachery. The city is in flames.
1447,ARGUMENT,AEneas heads a forlorn hope of rescue (352-441). He and his followers
1448,ARGUMENT,exchange armour with certain Greeks slain in the darkness. The ruse
1449,ARGUMENT,succeeds until they are taken for enemies by their friends. The
1450,ARGUMENT,Greeks rally. The Trojans scatter. At Priam's palace a last stand
1451,ARGUMENT,"is made, but Pyrrhus forces the great gates, and the defenders are"
1452,ARGUMENT,massacred (442-603). Priam's fate.--The sight of his headless corpse
1453,ARGUMENT,draws AEneas' thoughts to his own father's danger. Hastening
1454,ARGUMENT,"homewards he espies Helen, and is pausing to take vengeance and her"
1455,ARGUMENT,"life, when (604-711) Venus intervening opens his eyes to see the gods"
1456,ARGUMENT,aiding the Greeks (712-756). AEneas regains his home. Anchises
1457,ARGUMENT,"obstinately refuses to flee, until a halo is seen about the head of"
1458,ARGUMENT,"Ascanius (757-828), whereupon he accepts the omen and yields. The"
1459,ARGUMENT,"escape.--In a sudden panic Creusa is lost (829-900). AEneas, at peril"
1460,ARGUMENT,"of his life, is seeking her throughout the city, when her wraith"

1463,ARGUMENT,"the surviving Trojans, flees to the hills (901-972)."
1464,ARGUMENT,
1465,ARGUMENT,
1466,ARGUMENT,"I.  All hushed intent, when from his lofty seat"
1467,ARGUMENT,"Troy's sire began, ""O queen, a tale too true,"
1468,ARGUMENT,"Too sad for words, thou biddest me repeat;"
1469,ARGUMENT,"How Ilion perished, and the Danaan crew"

1471,ARGUMENT,"The woes I saw, thrice piteous to behold,"
1472,ARGUMENT,"And largely shared. What Myrmidon, or who"
1473,ARGUMENT,Of stern Ulysses' warriors can withhold
1474,ARGUMENT,"His tears, to tell such things, as thou would'st have re-told?"

1480,ARGUMENT,"The tale of Troy's last agony and woe,"
1481,ARGUMENT,"The toils we suffered, though my heart doth ache,"

1493,ARGUMENT,And caverns of the womb by stealth enclose

1500,ARGUMENT,"Lay hid, while fondly to Mycenae's land"

3497,ARGUMENT,Dido opens her heart to her sister. But for her promised loyalty to
3498,ARGUMENT,"the dead Sychaeus, she must have yielded (1-36). Anna pleads for"
3499,ARGUMENT,"AEneas, and Dido half-yielding sacrifices to the marriage-gods. The"
3500,ARGUMENT,growth of her passion is described (37-104). Venus feigns assent to
3501,ARGUMENT,Juno's proposal that AEneas shall marry Dido and be king of Carthage.
3502,ARGUMENT,At a hunting Juno will send a storm and the lovers will shelter in
3503,ARGUMENT,"a cave, and there plight their vows (105-144). The plot is"
3504,ARGUMENT,"consummated. Dido yields (145-198). Description of Rumour, who"
3505,ARGUMENT,bruits abroad the story and rouses the jealous Iarbas to conjure his
3506,ARGUMENT,"father, Jupiter, to interpose (199-248). Jupiter sends Mercury to"
3507,ARGUMENT,"remind AEneas of his mission (249-298). AEneas, terrified by the"
3508,ARGUMENT,"message, prepares for instant flight, to the delight of his followers"
3509,ARGUMENT,"and the despair of Dido (299-342), who entreats him to stay, and"
3510,ARGUMENT,rehearses the dangers to which he is leaving her (343-374). AEneas
3511,ARGUMENT,"is obdurate. Although he loves Dido, he is the slave of a destiny"
3512,ARGUMENT,which he must at all costs fulfil (375-410). After calling down a
3513,ARGUMENT,"solemn curse upon him Dido swoons, but crushing the impulse to"
3514,ARGUMENT,"comfort her, he hastens his preparations for departure (411-468)."
3515,ARGUMENT,"Dido sends Anna with a last appeal to AEneas, who nevertheless, in"
3516,ARGUMENT,"spite of struggles, obeys the gods (469-513). In utter misery Dido,"

3518,ARGUMENT,"summons a sorceress. Her preparations complete, she utters her last"
3519,ARGUMENT,"lament (514-639). Mercury repeats his warning to AEneas, who sails"
3520,ARGUMENT,"forthwith (640-671). Daybreak reveals his flight, and Dido--cursing"
3521,ARGUMENT,"her betrayer--falls by her own hand, to the despair of her sister"

3581,ARGUMENT,A brother's threats? Well know I Juno's grace
3582,ARGUMENT,And heaven's propitious auspices conspire
3583,ARGUMENT,To find for Trojans here the home of their desire.

3595,ARGUMENT,"VIII. So fanned, her passion kindled into flame:"
3596,ARGUMENT,"Hope scattered scruples, and her doubts gave way,"
3597,ARGUMENT,And loosed were all the lingering ties of shame.
3598,ARGUMENT,"First to the fane the sisters haste away,"
3599,ARGUMENT,"And there for peace at every shrine they pray,"
3600,ARGUMENT,"And chosen ewes, as ancient rites ordain,"
3601,ARGUMENT,"To Sire Lyaeus, to the God of Day,"

3617,ARGUMENT,"Some swain hath pierced amid the woods of Crete,"
3618,ARGUMENT,"And left, unware, the flying steel to stay,"
3619,ARGUMENT,While through the forests and the lawns his prey

3654,ARGUMENT,
3655,ARGUMENT,"XIV. ""Come then and rule we, each with equal power,"

3695,ARGUMENT,"XVIII. Now forth at length, with numbers in her train,"
3696,ARGUMENT,"She comes in state, majestic to behold,"
3697,ARGUMENT,Wrapped in a purpled scarf of Tyrian grain.
3698,ARGUMENT,All golden is her quiver; knots of gold
3699,ARGUMENT,Confine her hair; a golden clasp doth hold
3700,ARGUMENT,Her purple cloak. Behind her throng amain
3701,ARGUMENT,"The Trojans, with Iulus, blithe and bold,"
3702,ARGUMENT,"And good AEneas, with the rest, as fain,"
3703,ARGUMENT,"Joins in, and steps along, the comeliest of the train."
3704,ARGUMENT,
3705,ARGUMENT,XIX. As when from wintry Lycia and the shore
3706,ARGUMENT,"Of Xanthus, to his mother's Delian seat"
3707,ARGUMENT,"Apollo comes, the dances to restore."
3708,ARGUMENT,"Around his shrines Dryopians, sons of Crete,"

3716,ARGUMENT,"Lo! from the rocks dislodged, the goats in fear"
3717,ARGUMENT,Bound o'er the crags. In dust-clouds o'er the plain
3718,ARGUMENT,Down from the mountains rush the frightened deer.
3719,ARGUMENT,"On mettled steed the boy, in wild career,"
3720,ARGUMENT,"Outrides them, glorying in the chase. No more"
3721,ARGUMENT,"He heeds such timid prey, but longs to hear"
3722,ARGUMENT,"The tawny lion, issuing with a roar"
3723,ARGUMENT,"Forth from the lofty hills, and front the foaming boar."
3724,ARGUMENT,
3725,ARGUMENT,"XXI. Meanwhile deep mutterings vex the louring sky,"
3726,ARGUMENT,"And, mixt with hail, in torrents comes the rain."
3727,ARGUMENT,"Scar'd, o'er the fields to diverse shelter fly"
3728,ARGUMENT,"Troy's sons, Ascanius, and the Tyrian train."
3729,ARGUMENT,Down from the hills the deluge pours amain.
3730,ARGUMENT,"One cave protects the pair. Earth gives the sign,"
3731,ARGUMENT,"With Juno, mistress of the nuptial chain."
3732,ARGUMENT,"And heaven bears witness, and the lightnings shine,"
3733,ARGUMENT,And from the crags above shriek out the Nymphs divine.
3734,ARGUMENT,
3735,ARGUMENT,"XXII. Dark day of fate, and dismal hour of sin!"
3736,ARGUMENT,"Then first disaster did the gods ordain,"
3737,ARGUMENT,And death and woe were destined to begin.
3738,ARGUMENT,"Nor shame nor scandal now the Queen restrain,"
3739,ARGUMENT,"No more she meditates to hide the stain,"
3740,ARGUMENT,No longer chooses to conceal her flame.
3741,ARGUMENT,"Marriage she calls it, but the fraud is plain,"
3742,ARGUMENT,"And pretexts weaves, and with a specious name"
3743,ARGUMENT,"Attempts to veil her guilt, and sanctify her shame."
3744,ARGUMENT,
3745,ARGUMENT,"XXIII. Fame with the news through Libya's cities hies,"
3746,ARGUMENT,"Fame, far the swiftest of all mischiefs bred;"
3747,ARGUMENT,Speed gives her force; she strengthens as she flies.
3748,ARGUMENT,"Small first through fear, she lifts a loftier head,"
3749,ARGUMENT,"Her forehead in the clouds, on earth her tread."
3750,ARGUMENT,"Last sister of Enceladus, whom Earth"
3751,ARGUMENT,"Brought forth, in anger with the gods, 'tis said,"
3752,ARGUMENT,"Swift-winged, swift-footed, of enormous girth,"
3753,ARGUMENT,"Huge, horrible, deformed, a giantess from birth."
3754,ARGUMENT,
3755,ARGUMENT,"XXIV. As many feathers as her form surround,"
3756,ARGUMENT,"Strange sight! peep forth so many watchful eyes,"
3757,ARGUMENT,"So many mouths and tattling tongues resound,"
3758,ARGUMENT,So many ears among the plumes uprise.
3759,ARGUMENT,"By night with shrieks 'twixt heaven and earth she flies,"
3760,ARGUMENT,Nor suffers sleep her eyelids to subdue;
3761,ARGUMENT,"By day, the terror of great towns, she spies"
3762,ARGUMENT,"From towers and housetops, perched aloft in view,"
3763,ARGUMENT,"Fond of the false and foul, yet herald of the true."
3764,ARGUMENT,
3765,ARGUMENT,"XXV. So now, exulting, with a mingled hum"
3766,ARGUMENT,"Of truth and falsehood, through the crowd she sped;"
3767,ARGUMENT,"How one AEneas hath from Ilion come,"
3768,ARGUMENT,"A Dardan guest, whom Dido deigns to wed."
3769,ARGUMENT,"Now, lapt in dalliance and with ease o'erfed,"
3770,ARGUMENT,"All winter long they revel in their shame,"
3771,ARGUMENT,Lost to their kingdoms. Such the tale she spread;
3772,ARGUMENT,"And straight the demon to Iarbas came,"
3773,ARGUMENT,"And wrath on wrath upheaped, and fanned his soul to flame."
3774,ARGUMENT,
3775,ARGUMENT,"XXVI. Born of a nymph, by Ammon's forced embrace,"
3776,ARGUMENT,A hundred temples and in each a shrine
3777,ARGUMENT,"He built to Jove, the father of his race,"
3778,ARGUMENT,"And lit the sacred fires, that sleepless shine,"
3779,ARGUMENT,The Gods' eternal watches. Slaughtered kine
3780,ARGUMENT,"Smoke on the teeming pavement, garlands fair"
3781,ARGUMENT,Of various hues the stately porch entwine.
3782,ARGUMENT,"Stung by the bitter tidings, in despair"
3783,ARGUMENT,"Before the gods he kneels, and pours a suppliant's prayer."
3784,ARGUMENT,
3785,ARGUMENT,"XXVII. ""Great Jove, to whom our Moorish tribes, reclined"
3786,ARGUMENT,"On broidered couch, the votive wine-cup drain,"
3787,ARGUMENT,"See'st thou or, Father, are thy bolts but blind,"
3788,ARGUMENT,"Mere noise thy thunder, and thy lightnings vain?"
3789,ARGUMENT,"This woman here, who, wandering on the main,"
3790,ARGUMENT,Bought leave to build and govern as her own
3791,ARGUMENT,"Her puny town, and till the sandy plain,"
3792,ARGUMENT,"Our proffered love hath ventured to disown,"
3793,ARGUMENT,"And takes a Trojan lord, AEneas, to her throne."
3794,ARGUMENT,
3795,ARGUMENT,"XXVIII. ""And now that Paris, tricked in Lydian guise,"
3796,ARGUMENT,"With perfumed locks and bonnet, and his crew"
3797,ARGUMENT,"Of men half-women, gloats upon the prize,"
3798,ARGUMENT,"While vainly at thy so-called shrines we sue,"
3799,ARGUMENT,"And nurse a faith as empty as untrue."""
3800,ARGUMENT,He prayed and clasped the altar. His request
3801,ARGUMENT,"Jove heard, and to the city bent his view,"
3802,ARGUMENT,"And saw the guilty lovers, lapt in rest"
3803,ARGUMENT,"And lost to shame, and thus Cyllenius he addressed:"
3804,ARGUMENT,
3805,ARGUMENT,"XXIX. ""Go, son, the Zephyrs call, and wing thy flight"
3806,ARGUMENT,"To Carthage. Call the Dardan chief away,"
3807,ARGUMENT,"Who, deaf to Fate, his destined walls doth slight."
3808,ARGUMENT,"This mandate through the wafting air convey,"
3809,ARGUMENT,"Not such fair Venus did her son pourtray,"
3810,ARGUMENT,Nor twice for _this_ from Grecian swords reclaim
3811,ARGUMENT,"One born to rule Italia, big with sway"
3812,ARGUMENT,"And fierce for war, and spread the Teucrian name"
3813,ARGUMENT,"Through Teucer's sons, and laws to conquered earth proclaim."

3818,ARGUMENT,"Shall he, a father, envy to his seed"
3819,ARGUMENT,"The towers of Rome, by destiny decreed?"
3820,ARGUMENT,What schemes he now? what hope the chief constrains
3821,ARGUMENT,"To linger 'mid a hostile race, nor heed"
3822,ARGUMENT,Ausonia's sons and the Lavinian plains?
3823,ARGUMENT,"Go, bid him sail; enough; that word the sum contains."""
3824,ARGUMENT,
3825,ARGUMENT,XXXI. Jove spake. Cyllenius to his feet binds fast
3826,ARGUMENT,"His golden sandals, that aloft in flight"
3827,ARGUMENT,"O'er sea and shore upbear him with the blast,"
3828,ARGUMENT,"Then takes his rod--the rod of mystic might,"
3829,ARGUMENT,That calls from Hell or plunges into night
3830,ARGUMENT,"The pallid ghosts, gives sleep or bids it fly,"
3831,ARGUMENT,And lifts the dead man's eyelids to the light.
3832,ARGUMENT,"Armed with that rod, he rules the clouds on high,"
3833,ARGUMENT,"And drives the scattered gales, and sails the stormy sky."
3834,ARGUMENT,
3835,ARGUMENT,"XXXII. Now, borne along, beneath him he espies"
3836,ARGUMENT,The sides precipitous and towering peak
3837,ARGUMENT,"Of rugged Atlas, who upholds the skies."
3838,ARGUMENT,"Round his pine-covered forehead, wild and bleak,"
3839,ARGUMENT,The dark clouds settle and the storm-winds shriek.
3840,ARGUMENT,"His shoulders glisten with the mantling snow,"
3841,ARGUMENT,"Dark roll the torrents down his aged cheek,"
3842,ARGUMENT,"Seamed with the wintry ravage, and below,"
3843,ARGUMENT,Stiff with the gathered ice his hoary beard doth show.
3844,ARGUMENT,
3845,ARGUMENT,"XXXIII. Poised on his wings, here first Cyllenius stood,"
3846,ARGUMENT,"Then downward shot, and in the salt sea spray"
3847,ARGUMENT,"Dipped like a sea-gull, who, in quest of food,"
3848,ARGUMENT,"Searches the teeming shore-cliffs for his prey,"
3849,ARGUMENT,And scours the rocks and skims along the bay.
3850,ARGUMENT,"So swiftly now, between the earth and skies,"
3851,ARGUMENT,"Leaving his mother's sire, his airy way"
3852,ARGUMENT,"Cyllene's god on cleaving pinions plies,"
3853,ARGUMENT,As o'er the Libyan sands along the wind he flies.
3854,ARGUMENT,
3855,ARGUMENT,"XXXIV. Scarce now at Carthage had he stayed his feet,"
3856,ARGUMENT,"Among the huts AEneas he espied,"
3857,ARGUMENT,Planning new towers and many a stately street.
3858,ARGUMENT,"A sword-hilt, starred with jasper, graced his side,"
3859,ARGUMENT,"A scarf, gold-broidered by the queen, and dyed"
3860,ARGUMENT,"With Tyrian hues, was o'er his shoulders thrown."
3861,ARGUMENT,"""What, thou--wilt thou build Carthage?"" Hermes cried,"
3862,ARGUMENT,"""And stay to beautify thy lady's town,"
3863,ARGUMENT,"And dote on Tyrian realms, and disregard thine own?"

3869,ARGUMENT,"Nowise can move thee, nor thy soul inflame,"
3870,ARGUMENT,"If loth to labour for thine own renown,"
3871,ARGUMENT,Think of thy young Ascanius; see with shame

3873,ARGUMENT,"Hope of the Roman race, and heir of Latium's throne."""
3874,ARGUMENT,
3875,ARGUMENT,"XXXVI. He spake and, speaking, vanished into air."
3876,ARGUMENT,"Dumb stood AEneas, by the sight unmann'd:"
3877,ARGUMENT,Fear stifled speech and stiffened all his hair.
3878,ARGUMENT,"Fain would he fly, and quit the tempting land,"
3879,ARGUMENT,Surprised and startled by the god's command.
3880,ARGUMENT,Ah! what to do? what opening can he find
3881,ARGUMENT,"To break the news, the infuriate Queen withstand?"
3882,ARGUMENT,"This way and that dividing his swift mind,"
3883,ARGUMENT,"All means in turns he tries, and wavers like the wind."
3884,ARGUMENT,
3885,ARGUMENT,XXXVII. This plan prevails; he bids a chosen few
3886,ARGUMENT,"Collect the crews in silence, arm the fleet"
3887,ARGUMENT,"And hide the purport of these counsels new,"
3888,ARGUMENT,"Himself, since Dido dreams not of deceit,"
3889,ARGUMENT,"Nor thinks such passion can be frail or fleet,"
3890,ARGUMENT,"Some avenue of access will essay,"
3891,ARGUMENT,"Some tender moment for soft speeches meet,"
3892,ARGUMENT,"And wit shall find, and cunning smooth the way."
3893,ARGUMENT,"With joy the captains hear, and hasten to obey."
3894,ARGUMENT,
3895,ARGUMENT,XXXVIII. But Dido--who can cheat a lover's care?
3896,ARGUMENT,"Could guess the fraud, the coming change descry,"
3897,ARGUMENT,And in the midst of safety feared a snare.
3898,ARGUMENT,Now wicked Fame hath bid the rumour fly
3899,ARGUMENT,"Of mustering crews. Poor Dido, crazed thereby,"
3900,ARGUMENT,"Raves like a Thyiad, when the frenzied rout"
3901,ARGUMENT,"With orgies hurry to Cithaeron high,"
3902,ARGUMENT,"And ""Bacchus! Bacchus"" through the night they shout."
3903,ARGUMENT,"At length the chief she finds, and thus her wrath breaks out:"
3904,ARGUMENT,
3905,ARGUMENT,"XXXIX. ""Thought'st thou to steal in silence from the land,"
3906,ARGUMENT,False wretch! and cloak such treason with a lie?
3907,ARGUMENT,"Can neither love, nor this my plighted hand,"
3908,ARGUMENT,"Nor dying Dido keep thee? Must thou fly,"
3909,ARGUMENT,"When North-winds howl, and wintry waves are high?"
3910,ARGUMENT,"O cruel! what if home before thee lay,"
3911,ARGUMENT,"Not lands unknown, beneath an alien sky,"
3912,ARGUMENT,"If Troy were standing, as in ancient day,"
3913,ARGUMENT,Would'st thou for Troy's own sake this angry deep essay?
3914,ARGUMENT,
3915,ARGUMENT,"XL. ""_Me_ dost thou fly? O, by these tears, thy hand"
3916,ARGUMENT,"Late pledged, since madness leaves me naught beside,"
3917,ARGUMENT,"But lovers' vows and wedlock's sacred band,"
3918,ARGUMENT,Scarce knit and now too soon to be untied;
3919,ARGUMENT,"If aught were pleasing in a new-won bride,"
3920,ARGUMENT,"If sweet the memory of our marriage day,"
3921,ARGUMENT,O by these prayers--if place for prayer abide--
3922,ARGUMENT,In mercy put that cruel mind away.

3929,ARGUMENT,Perchance had raised me to a starry throne.
3930,ARGUMENT,"O think with whom thou leav'st me to thy fate,"
3931,ARGUMENT,"Dear guest, no longer as a husband known."

3941,ARGUMENT,"Keeps still unmoved, and, though with anguish torn,"
3942,ARGUMENT,"Strives with his love, nor suffers it to rise,"
3943,ARGUMENT,"But checks his heaving heart, and thus at length replies:"

3947,ARGUMENT,"Nor ever fair Elissa's name forget,"
3948,ARGUMENT,"While memory shall last, or pulses beat."
3949,ARGUMENT,"Few words are mine, for fewest words are meet."
3950,ARGUMENT,Think not I meant--the very thought were shame--
3951,ARGUMENT,Thief-like to veil my going with deceit.
3952,ARGUMENT,"I gave no promise of a husband's name,"
3953,ARGUMENT,"Nor talked of ties like that, or wedlock's sacred flame."

4210,ARGUMENT,"""What, then,"" she sadly ponders, ""shall I do?"
4211,ARGUMENT,"Ah, woe is me! shall Dido, made a jest"

4240,ARGUMENT,"Like Mercury, the very God behold!"
4241,ARGUMENT,"So sweet his voice, so radiant was his hue,"
4242,ARGUMENT,"Such loveliness of limb and youthful mould,"

4385,ARGUMENT,"LXXXVII. She paused, and pressed her lips upon the bed."
4386,ARGUMENT,"""To die--and unavenged? Yea, let me die!"
4387,ARGUMENT,Thus--thus it joys to journey to the dead.
4388,ARGUMENT,Let yon false Dardan with remorseful eye
4389,ARGUMENT,"Drink in this bale-fire from the deep, and sigh"
4390,ARGUMENT,"To bear the omens of my death.""--No more"
4391,ARGUMENT,"She said, but swooned. The servants see her lie,"
4392,ARGUMENT,"Sunk on the sword; they see the life-blood pour,"
4393,ARGUMENT,"Reddening her tender hands, the weapon drenched with gore."
4394,ARGUMENT,
4395,ARGUMENT,"LXXXVIII. Then through the lofty palace rose a scream,"
4396,ARGUMENT,"And madly Rumour riots, as she flies"
4397,ARGUMENT,Through the shocked town. The very houses seem
4398,ARGUMENT,"To groan, and shrieks, and sobbing and the cries"
4399,ARGUMENT,Of wailing women pierce the vaulted skies.
4400,ARGUMENT,'Twas e'en as though all Carthage or old Tyre
4401,ARGUMENT,"Were falling, stormed by ruthless enemies,"
4402,ARGUMENT,While over roof and battlement and spire
4403,ARGUMENT,And temples of the Gods rolled on the infuriate fire.
4404,ARGUMENT,
4405,ARGUMENT,"LXXXIX. Her sister heard, and through the concourse came,"
4406,ARGUMENT,"And tore her cheeks and beat her bosom fair,"
4407,ARGUMENT,And called upon the dying Queen by name.
4408,ARGUMENT,"""Sister! was this thy secret? thine this snare?"
4409,ARGUMENT,For me this fraud? For this did I prepare
4410,ARGUMENT,"That pyre, those flames and altars? This the end?"
4411,ARGUMENT,"Ah me, forlorn! what worse remains to bear?"
4412,ARGUMENT,"Would'st thou in death desert me, and pretend"
4413,ARGUMENT,"To scorn a sister's care, and shun me as a friend?"
4414,ARGUMENT,
4415,ARGUMENT,"XC. ""Thou should'st have called me to thy doom! One stroke,"
4416,ARGUMENT,"A moment's pang, and we had ceased to sigh."
4417,ARGUMENT,"Reared I this pyre, did I the gods invoke"
4418,ARGUMENT,"To leave thee thus companionless, to die?"
4419,ARGUMENT,"Lo, all are dead together, thou and I,"
4420,ARGUMENT,"Town, princes, people, perished in a day."
4421,ARGUMENT,"Bring water; let me close the lightless eye,"
4422,ARGUMENT,"And bathe those wounds, and kiss those lips of clay,"
4423,ARGUMENT,"And catch one fluttering breath, if yet, perchance, I may!"""
4424,ARGUMENT,
4425,ARGUMENT,"XCI. So saying, she climbs the steps, and, groaning sore,"
4426,ARGUMENT,"Clasps to her breast her sister ere she dies,"
4427,ARGUMENT,And stanches with her robe the streaming gore.
4428,ARGUMENT,"In vain poor Dido lifts her wearied eyes,"
4429,ARGUMENT,The closing eyelids sicken at the skies.
4430,ARGUMENT,Deep gurgles in her breast the deadly wound;
4431,ARGUMENT,"Thrice on her elbow she essays to rise,"
4432,ARGUMENT,Thrice back she sinks. With wandering eyes all round
4433,ARGUMENT,"She seeks the light of heaven, and moans when it is found."
4434,ARGUMENT,
4435,ARGUMENT,"XCII. Then Juno, pitying her agony"
4436,ARGUMENT,"Of lingering death, sent Iris down with speed."
4437,ARGUMENT,Her struggling soul from clinging limbs to free.
4438,ARGUMENT,"For since by Fate, or for her own misdeed"
4439,ARGUMENT,"She perished not, but, ere the day decreed,"
4440,ARGUMENT,"Fell in the frenzy of her love's despair,"
4441,ARGUMENT,"Not yet Proserpina had claimed her meed,"
4442,ARGUMENT,"And shorn the ringlet of her golden hair,"
4443,ARGUMENT,And bade the sacred shade to Stygian realms repair.
4444,ARGUMENT,
4445,ARGUMENT,XCIII. So down to earth came Iris from on high
4446,ARGUMENT,On saffron wings all glittering with the dew.
4447,ARGUMENT,A thousand tints against the sunlit sky
4448,ARGUMENT,"She flashed from out her rainbow as she flew,"
4449,ARGUMENT,"Then, hovering overhead, these words outthrew,"
4450,ARGUMENT,"""Behold, to Dis this offering I bear,"
4451,ARGUMENT,"And loose thee from thy body.""--Forth she drew"
4452,ARGUMENT,"The fatal shears, and clipped the golden hair;"

4463,ARGUMENT,"AEneas, unaware of Dido's fate, sails away to Acestes in Sicily, and"
4464,ARGUMENT,prepares funeral games against the anniversary of Anchises' death
4465,ARGUMENT,(1-90). Offerings are paid to the spirit of Anchises. Sicilians and
4466,ARGUMENT,"Trojans assemble for the first contest, a boat race (91-140), which"
4467,ARGUMENT,"is described at length. Cloanthus, ancestor of the Cluentii, wins"
4468,ARGUMENT,"with the ""Scylla"" (141-342). The foot-race is next narrated."
4469,ARGUMENT,"Euryalus, by his friend's cunning, gains the first prize, and the"
4470,ARGUMENT,"scene shifts (343-441) to the ring, in which Dares is defeated by"
4471,ARGUMENT,"the veteran Entellus, who fells the ox, his prize, as an offering"
4472,ARGUMENT,to his master Eryx (442-594). After some wonderful shooting in the
4473,ARGUMENT,"archery which follows, AEneas awards the first prize to Acestes, as"
4474,ARGUMENT,the favourite of the gods (595-667). Before this contest is over
4475,ARGUMENT,AEneas summons Ascanius and his boy-companions to perform the
4476,ARGUMENT,"elaborate manoeuvres afterwards celebrated in Rome as the ""Trojan"
4477,ARGUMENT,"Ride"" (668-729). Juno schemes to destroy the Trojan fleet, while the"
4478,ARGUMENT,"games are being held. She inspires with discontent the Trojan matrons,"
4479,ARGUMENT,who are not present at the festival. They set fire to the ships
4480,ARGUMENT,(730-810). Ascanius hurries to the scene. Jupiter sends rain and
4481,ARGUMENT,saves all the ships but four (811-855). Nautes advises AEneas to
4482,ARGUMENT,leave behind the weak and aged with Acestes. The wraith of Anchises
4483,ARGUMENT,"enforces the advice, and bids AEneas visit him in the nether-world"
4484,ARGUMENT,(856-909). Preparations for departure. Acestes accepts his new
4485,ARGUMENT,"subjects, and the Trojans depart. Venus prevails on Neptune to grant"
4486,ARGUMENT,"them safe convoy in return for the life of the helmsman Palinurus,"
4487,ARGUMENT,who is drowned (910-1062).
4488,ARGUMENT,
4489,ARGUMENT,"I.  Now well at sea, AEneas, fixt in mind,"
4490,ARGUMENT,"Held on his course, and cleft the watery ways"
4491,ARGUMENT,"Through billows blackened by the northern wind,"
4492,ARGUMENT,"And backward on the city bent his gaze,"
4493,ARGUMENT,Bright with the flames of Dido. Whence the blaze
4494,ARGUMENT,"Arose, they knew not; but the pangs they knew"
4495,ARGUMENT,"When love is passionate, and man betrays,"
4496,ARGUMENT,"And what a frantic woman scorned can do,"
4497,ARGUMENT,And many a sad surmise their boding thoughts pursue.
4498,ARGUMENT,
4499,ARGUMENT,II. The fleet was on mid-ocean; land no more
4500,ARGUMENT,"Was visible, nor aught but sea and sky;"
4501,ARGUMENT,"When lo! above them a black cloud, that bore"
4502,ARGUMENT,"Tempest and Night, frowned iron-dark on high,"
4503,ARGUMENT,"And the wave, shuddering as the wind swept by,"
4504,ARGUMENT,Curled and was darkened. From the stern loud cries
4505,ARGUMENT,"The pilot Palinurus: ""Whence and why"
4506,ARGUMENT,This cloudy rack that gathers o'er the skies?
4507,ARGUMENT,"What, father Neptune, now, what mischief dost devise?"""
4508,ARGUMENT,
4509,ARGUMENT,"III. So having said, he bade the seamen take"
4510,ARGUMENT,"The tackling in, and ply the lusty oar,"
4511,ARGUMENT,"Then sloped the mainsheet to the wind, and spake:"
4512,ARGUMENT,"""Noble AEneas, e'en if high Jove swore"
4513,ARGUMENT,"To bring us safely to Italia's shore,"
4514,ARGUMENT,"With skies like these, 'twere hopeless. Westward loom"
4515,ARGUMENT,"The dark clouds mustering, and the changed winds roar"
4516,ARGUMENT,"Athwart us, and the air is thick with gloom."
4517,ARGUMENT,"Vainly we strive to move, and struggle with our doom."
4518,ARGUMENT,
4519,ARGUMENT,"IV. ""Come, then, since Fortune hath the mastering hand,"
4520,ARGUMENT,"Yield we and turn. Not far, methinks, there lies"
4521,ARGUMENT,"A friendly shore, thy brother Eryx' land,"
4522,ARGUMENT,"And ports Sicanian, if aright these eyes"
4523,ARGUMENT,"Recall my former reading of the skies."""
4524,ARGUMENT,"Then good AEneas: ""Long ago, 'tis plain,"
4525,ARGUMENT,"The winds so willed it. I have seen,"" he cries,"
4526,ARGUMENT,"""And marked thee toiling in their teeth in vain."
4527,ARGUMENT,"Shift sail and turn the helm. What sweeter shore to gain,"
4528,ARGUMENT,
4529,ARGUMENT,"V.  ""What port more welcome to a wearied fleet"
4530,ARGUMENT,"And wave-worn mariners, what land more blest"
4531,ARGUMENT,"Than that where still Acestes lives, to greet"
4532,ARGUMENT,"His Dardan friends, and in the boon earth's breast"
4533,ARGUMENT,"My father's bones, Anchises', are at rest?"""
4534,ARGUMENT,He spake; at once the Trojans strive to gain
4535,ARGUMENT,"The port. Fair breezes, blowing from the West,"
4536,ARGUMENT,"Swell out the sails. They bound along the main,"
4537,ARGUMENT,And soon with gladdening hearts the well-known shore attain.
4538,ARGUMENT,
4539,ARGUMENT,"VI. Far off Acestes, wondering, from a height"
4540,ARGUMENT,"The coming of their friendly ships descries,"
4541,ARGUMENT,And hastes to meet them. Roughly is he dight
4542,ARGUMENT,"In Libyan bearskin, as in huntsman's guise;"
4543,ARGUMENT,A pointed javelin in each hand he plies.
4544,ARGUMENT,"Him once a Trojan to Crimisus bore,"
4545,ARGUMENT,The stream-god. Mindful of ancestral ties
4546,ARGUMENT,"He hails his weary kinsmen, come once more,"
4547,ARGUMENT,"And dainty fruits sets forth, and cheers them from his store."
4548,ARGUMENT,
4549,ARGUMENT,"VII. Next dawn had chased the stars, when on the shore"
4550,ARGUMENT,AEneas thus the gathered crews addressed:
4551,ARGUMENT,"""Twelve months have passed, brave Dardans, since we bore"
4552,ARGUMENT,"The bones of great Anchises to his rest,"
4553,ARGUMENT,"And laid his ashes in the ground, and blessed"
4554,ARGUMENT,The mourning altars by the rolling sea.
4555,ARGUMENT,"And now once more, if rightly I have guessed,"
4556,ARGUMENT,"The day is come, which Heaven hath willed to be"
4557,ARGUMENT,"Sacred for evermore, but ever sad to me."
4558,ARGUMENT,
4559,ARGUMENT,"VIII. This day, though exiled on Gaetulian sands,"
4560,ARGUMENT,"Or caught by tempests on th' AEgean brine,"
4561,ARGUMENT,"Or at Mycenae in the foemen's hands,"
4562,ARGUMENT,"With annual honours will I hold divine,"
4563,ARGUMENT,And head with fitting offerings the shrine.
4564,ARGUMENT,"By chance unsought, now hither are we led,"
4565,ARGUMENT,"Yet not, I ween, without the God's design,"
4566,ARGUMENT,"Where lie the ashes of my father dead,"
4567,ARGUMENT,"And greet a friendly port, by favouring breezes sped."
4568,ARGUMENT,
4569,ARGUMENT,"IX. ""Come then, with festival his name revere,"
4570,ARGUMENT,"Pray we for winds to waft us, and entreat"
4571,ARGUMENT,"His shade to take these offerings year by year,"
4572,ARGUMENT,"When gathered to our new-built Troy, we meet"
4573,ARGUMENT,"In hallowed fanes, his worship to repeat."
4574,ARGUMENT,"See, for each ship two head of horned kine"
4575,ARGUMENT,"Acestes sends, his Trojan friends to greet"
4576,ARGUMENT,"Bid then the home-gods of the Trojan line,"
4577,ARGUMENT,"With those our host adores, to grace the feast divine."
4578,ARGUMENT,
4579,ARGUMENT,"X.  ""Nay, if the ninth fair morning show fine day,"
4580,ARGUMENT,"And bring the sunshine, be a match decreed"
4581,ARGUMENT,"For Teucrian ships, their swiftness to essay."
4582,ARGUMENT,"Next, in the footrace whosoe'er hath speed,"
4583,ARGUMENT,"Or, glorying in his manhood, claims the meed"
4584,ARGUMENT,"With dart, or flying arrow and the bow,"
4585,ARGUMENT,"Or bout with untanned gauntlet, mark and heed,"
4586,ARGUMENT,And wait the victor's guerdon. Come ye now;
4587,ARGUMENT,"Hush'd be each idle tongue, and garlanded each brow."""
4588,ARGUMENT,
4589,ARGUMENT,"XI. He spake, and round his temples binds with joy"
4590,ARGUMENT,"His mother's myrtle. Helymus is crowned,"
4591,ARGUMENT,"The veteran Acestes, and the boy"
4592,ARGUMENT,"Ascanius, and the Trojan warriors round."
4593,ARGUMENT,So from the council to the funeral mound
4594,ARGUMENT,"He moves, the centre of a circling crowd."
4595,ARGUMENT,"Two bowls of wine he pours upon the ground,"
4596,ARGUMENT,"Two of warm milk, and two of victim's blood,"
4597,ARGUMENT,"And, scattering purple flowers, invokes the shade aloud."
4598,ARGUMENT,
4599,ARGUMENT,"XII. ""Hail, holy Sire! blest Spirit, hail once more,"
4600,ARGUMENT,"And ashes, vainly rescued! Not with thee"
4601,ARGUMENT,"Was I allowed to reach Italia's shore,"
4602,ARGUMENT,"The fields Ausonian that the Fates decree,"
4603,ARGUMENT,"And Latin Tiber--whatsoe'er it be."""
4604,ARGUMENT,"He ceased, when lo, a monstrous serpent, wound"
4605,ARGUMENT,"In seven huge coils, seven giant spires, they see"
4606,ARGUMENT,"Glide from the grave, and gently clasp the mound,"
4607,ARGUMENT,And 'twixt the altars trail in many a tortuous round.
4608,ARGUMENT,
4609,ARGUMENT,XIII. The back with azure and the scales with gold
4610,ARGUMENT,In streaks and glittering patches were ablaze:
4611,ARGUMENT,So doth the rainbow in the clouds unfold
4612,ARGUMENT,A thousand hues against the sun's bright rays.
4613,ARGUMENT,AEneas stood bewildered with amaze.
4614,ARGUMENT,"In lengthened train meanwhile the snake went on,"
4615,ARGUMENT,"'Twixt cups and bowls weaving its sinuous ways,"
4616,ARGUMENT,"Then sipped the sacred food, and harming none,"
4617,ARGUMENT,The tasted altars left and 'neath the tomb was gone.
4618,ARGUMENT,
4619,ARGUMENT,"XIV. Cheered, to Anchises he the rites renewed,"
4620,ARGUMENT,In doubt if there some Genius of the shrine
4621,ARGUMENT,Or menial spirit of his sire he viewed.
4622,ARGUMENT,"Two sheep, two dark-backed heifers, and two swine"
4623,ARGUMENT,"He slays, invoking, as he pours the wine,"
4624,ARGUMENT,"The ghost, released from Acheron. Glad of soul,"
4625,ARGUMENT,"Each adds his gift. These slay the sacred Kine,"
4626,ARGUMENT,"Pile altars, set the cauldrons, heap the coal,"
4627,ARGUMENT,"And, sitting, hold the spits, and roast the entrails whole."
4628,ARGUMENT,
4629,ARGUMENT,XV. Now came the looked-for day. The ninth fair dawn
4630,ARGUMENT,Bright Phaethon drove up a cloudless sky.
4631,ARGUMENT,Rumour and great Acestes' name had drawn
4632,ARGUMENT,The neighbouring folk; shoreward in crowds they hie
4633,ARGUMENT,"To see the Trojans, or the games to try."
4634,ARGUMENT,"Piled in the lists the presents they behold,"
4635,ARGUMENT,"Green garlands, tripods, robes of purple dye,"
4636,ARGUMENT,"The conqueror's palm, bright armour for the bold,"
4637,ARGUMENT,And many a talent's weight of silver and of gold.
4638,ARGUMENT,
4639,ARGUMENT,XVI. Now from a mound the trumpet's notes proclaim
4640,ARGUMENT,"The sports begun. Four galleys from the fleet,"
4641,ARGUMENT,"The choicest, manned by mariners of fame,"
4642,ARGUMENT,And matched in size and urged with ponderous beat
4643,ARGUMENT,"Of oar-blades, for the naval contest meet."
4644,ARGUMENT,"See, here the Shark comes speeding to her place,"
4645,ARGUMENT,"Trained is her crew and eager to compete,"
4646,ARGUMENT,"Brave Mnestheus is her captain, born to grace"
4647,ARGUMENT,"Italia's land ere long, and found the Memmian race."
4648,ARGUMENT,
4649,ARGUMENT,"XVII. Here too, the huge Chimaera towers along,"
4650,ARGUMENT,"A floating citadel, with walls of pine,"
4651,ARGUMENT,"Three tale of Dardans urge her, stout and strong,"
4652,ARGUMENT,Their triple tiers in unison combine
4653,ARGUMENT,"To drive her, ruled by Gyas, through the brine."
4654,ARGUMENT,"Borne in the monstrous Centaur, next doth come"
4655,ARGUMENT,"Sergestus, father of the Sergian line."
4656,ARGUMENT,"Last, in the dark-blue Scylla ploughs the foam"
4657,ARGUMENT,"Cloanthus, whence thy house, Cluentius of Rome."
4658,ARGUMENT,
4659,ARGUMENT,"XVIII. Far seaward stands, afront the foamy shore,"
4660,ARGUMENT,"A rock, half-hid when wintry waves upleap,"
4661,ARGUMENT,"And skies are starless, and the North-winds roar,"
4662,ARGUMENT,"But still and silent, when the calm waves sleep,"
4663,ARGUMENT,"A level top it lifts above the deep,"
4664,ARGUMENT,The seamews' haunt. A bough of ilex here
4665,ARGUMENT,"The good AEneas sets upon the steep,"
4666,ARGUMENT,"Green-leaved and tall,--a goal, to seamen clear,"
4667,ARGUMENT,"To seek and, doubling round, their homeward course to steer."
4668,ARGUMENT,
4669,ARGUMENT,"XIX. Each takes his station. On the sterns behold,"
4670,ARGUMENT,"Ranged in due order as the lots assign,"
4671,ARGUMENT,"The captains, gay with purple and with gold."
4672,ARGUMENT,"The crews their brows with poplar garlands twine,"
4673,ARGUMENT,And wet with oil their naked shoulders shine.
4674,ARGUMENT,"Prone on their oars, and straining from the thwart,"
4675,ARGUMENT,"With souls astretch, they listen for the sign."
4676,ARGUMENT,"Fear stirs the pulse and drains the throbbing heart,"
4677,ARGUMENT,"Thrilled with the lust of praise, and panting for the start."
4678,ARGUMENT,
4679,ARGUMENT,XX. Loud peals the trumpet. From the port they dash
4680,ARGUMENT,"With cheers. The waves hiss, as the strong arms keep"
4681,ARGUMENT,"In time, drawn up to finish with a flash;"
4682,ARGUMENT,"And three-toothed prow and oars, with measured sweep,"
4683,ARGUMENT,"Tear up the yawning furrows of the deep,"
4684,ARGUMENT,"Less swiftly, to the chariot yoked atwain,"
4685,ARGUMENT,"The bounding racers from the base outleap,"
4686,ARGUMENT,"Less keen the driver, as they scour the plain,"
4687,ARGUMENT,"Leans o'er the whistling lash, and slacks the streaming rein."
4688,ARGUMENT,
4689,ARGUMENT,"XXI. Shouts, cheers and plaudits wake the woods around,"
4690,ARGUMENT,"Their clamours roll along the land-locked shore,"
4691,ARGUMENT,"And, echoing, from the beaten hills rebound."
4692,ARGUMENT,"First Gyas comes, amid the rout and roar;"
4693,ARGUMENT,"Cloanthus second,--better with the oar"
4694,ARGUMENT,"His crew, but heavier is the load of pine."
4695,ARGUMENT,"Next Shark and Centaur struggle to the fore,"
4696,ARGUMENT,"Now Shark ahead, now Centaur, now in line"
4697,ARGUMENT,"The long keels, urged abreast, together plough the brine."
4698,ARGUMENT,
4699,ARGUMENT,"XXII. Near lay the rock, the goal was close in sight,"
4700,ARGUMENT,"When Gyas, first o'er half a length of tide"
4701,ARGUMENT,"Shouts to his helmsman: ""Whither to the right?"
4702,ARGUMENT,"Hug close the cliff, and graze the leftward side."
4703,ARGUMENT,"Let others hold the deep."" In vain he cried."
4704,ARGUMENT,"Menoetes feared the hidden reefs, and bore"
4705,ARGUMENT,"To seaward. ""Whither from thy course so wide?"
4706,ARGUMENT,"What; swerving still?"" the captain shouts once more,"
4707,ARGUMENT,"""Keep to the shore, I say, Menoetes, to the shore."""
4708,ARGUMENT,
4709,ARGUMENT,"XXIII. He turned, when lo! behind him, gaining fast,"
4710,ARGUMENT,Cloanthus. On the leeward side he stole
4711,ARGUMENT,"A narrower compass, grazing as he passed"
4712,ARGUMENT,"His rival's vessel and the sounding shoal,"
4713,ARGUMENT,"Then gained safe water, as he turned the goal."
4714,ARGUMENT,"Grief fired young Gyas at the sight, and drew"
4715,ARGUMENT,Tears from his eyes and anger from his soul.
4716,ARGUMENT,"Careless alike of honour and his crew,"
4717,ARGUMENT,Down from the lofty stern his timorous guide he threw.
4718,ARGUMENT,
4719,ARGUMENT,"XXIV. Forthwith he grasps the tiller in his hand,"
4720,ARGUMENT,"Captain and helmsman, and his comrades cheers,"
4721,ARGUMENT,"And wrests the rudder leftward to the land,"
4722,ARGUMENT,"Slow from the depths Menoetes reappears,"
4723,ARGUMENT,"Clogged by his clothes, and cumbered with his years."
4724,ARGUMENT,"Then, shoreward swimming, climbs with feeble craft"
4725,ARGUMENT,"The rock, and there sits drying. All with jeers"
4726,ARGUMENT,Laughed as he fell and floated; loud they laughed
4727,ARGUMENT,"As, sputtering, from his throat he spits the briny draught."
4728,ARGUMENT,
4729,ARGUMENT,"XXV. Joy, mixt with hope, as Gyas slacks his pace,"
4730,ARGUMENT,Fires the two hindmost. Now they near the mark;
4731,ARGUMENT,"Sergestus, leading, takes the inside place."
4732,ARGUMENT,"Yet not a length divides them, for the Shark"
4733,ARGUMENT,Shoots up halfway and overlaps his bark.
4734,ARGUMENT,"Mnestheus, amidships pacing, cheers his crew;"
4735,ARGUMENT,"""Now, now lean to, and let each arm be stark;"
4736,ARGUMENT,"Row, mighty Hector's followers, whom I drew"
4737,ARGUMENT,"From Troy, in Troy's last hour, my comrades tried and true!"
4738,ARGUMENT,
4739,ARGUMENT,"XXVI. ""Now for the strength and hardihood that braved"
4740,ARGUMENT,"Gaetulian shoals, and the Ionian main,"
4741,ARGUMENT,"And billows following billows, as they raved"
4742,ARGUMENT,Against steep Malea. Not mine to gain
4743,ARGUMENT,The prize: I strive not to be first--'tis vain.
4744,ARGUMENT,Sweet were the thought--but Neptune rules the race;
4745,ARGUMENT,"Let them the palm, whom he has willed, retain."
4746,ARGUMENT,"But oh, for shame! to take the hindmost place"
4747,ARGUMENT,"Win this--to ward that doom, and ban the dire disgrace."""
4748,ARGUMENT,
4749,ARGUMENT,"XXVII. Straining each nerve, they bend them to the oar."
4750,ARGUMENT,"The bronze poop reels, so lustily they row,"
4751,ARGUMENT,And from beneath them slips the watery floor.
4752,ARGUMENT,"The parched lips quiver, as they pant and blow,"
4753,ARGUMENT,Sweat pours in rivers from their limbs; when now
4754,ARGUMENT,"Chance brings the wished-for honour. Blindly rash,"
4755,ARGUMENT,Close to the rocks Sergestus drives his prow.
4756,ARGUMENT,Too close he steals; on jutting crags they dash;
4757,ARGUMENT,"The straining oars snap short, the bows with sudden crash"
4758,ARGUMENT,
4759,ARGUMENT,"XXVIII. Stick fast, and hang upon the ledge. Up spring"
4760,ARGUMENT,"With shouts the sailors, clamorous at delay,"
4761,ARGUMENT,"And snatch the crushed oars from the waves, and bring"
4762,ARGUMENT,"Sharp poles and steel-tipt boathooks, and essay"
4763,ARGUMENT,To thrust the forepart from the rocks away.
4764,ARGUMENT,"Brave Mnestheus sees and, glorying in his gain,"
4765,ARGUMENT,Invokes the winds. With oarsmen in array
4766,ARGUMENT,"His swift bark, urged with many a stalwart strain,"
4767,ARGUMENT,"Shoots down the sloping tide, and wins the open main."
4768,ARGUMENT,
4769,ARGUMENT,"XXIX. Like as a pigeon, startled from her rest,"
4770,ARGUMENT,"Swift from the crannies of the rock, where clings"
4771,ARGUMENT,"Her heart's desire, the darlings of her nest,"
4772,ARGUMENT,"Darts forth and, scared with terror, flaps her wings,"
4773,ARGUMENT,"Then, gliding smoothly, in the soft air swings,"
4774,ARGUMENT,And skims her liquid passage through the skies
4775,ARGUMENT,"On pinions motionless. So Mnestheus springs,"
4776,ARGUMENT,"So springs the Shark; her impulse, as she flies,"
4777,ARGUMENT,"Cleaving the homeward seas, the wanting wings supplies."
4778,ARGUMENT,
4779,ARGUMENT,"XXX. He leaves Sergestus, who implores in vain"
4780,ARGUMENT,"His aid, still toiling from the rocks to clear"
4781,ARGUMENT,And headway with his shattered oars to gain.
4782,ARGUMENT,"Soon huge Chimaera, left with none to steer,"
4783,ARGUMENT,"Drops off astern, and labours in the rear."
4784,ARGUMENT,"Alone remains Cloanthus, but the race"
4785,ARGUMENT,"Well-nigh is ended, and the goal is near;"
4786,ARGUMENT,"Him Mnestheus seeks; his crew, with quickened pace"
4787,ARGUMENT,"And utmost stretch of oars, press forward in the chase."
4788,ARGUMENT,
4789,ARGUMENT,"XXXI. Now, now the noise redoubles; cheers and cries"
4790,ARGUMENT,"Urge on the follower, and the wild acclaim"
4791,ARGUMENT,"Rolls up, and wakes the echoes of the skies."
4792,ARGUMENT,"These scorn to lose their vantage, stung with shame,"
4793,ARGUMENT,And life is wagered willingly for fame.
4794,ARGUMENT,"Success inspires the hindmost; as they dare,"
4795,ARGUMENT,They do; the thought of winning wins the game.
4796,ARGUMENT,"With equal honours Chance had crowned the pair,"
4797,ARGUMENT,"But thus, with outspread hands, Cloanthus breathed a prayer:"
4798,ARGUMENT,
4799,ARGUMENT,"XXXII. ""Great Gods of Ocean! on whose waves I ride,"
4800,ARGUMENT,"A milk-white bull upon the shore I vow,"
4801,ARGUMENT,"And with its entrails will I strew the tide,"
4802,ARGUMENT,"And on your altars make the wine outflow."""
4803,ARGUMENT,"Fair Panopea hears him from below,"
4804,ARGUMENT,"The Nereids hear, and old Portunus plies"
4805,ARGUMENT,"His own great hand, to push them as they go."
4806,ARGUMENT,"Swifter than arrow to the shore she flies,"
4807,ARGUMENT,"Swifter than Southern gale, and in the harbour lies."
4808,ARGUMENT,
4809,ARGUMENT,"XXXIII. All summoned now, the herald's voice declares"
4810,ARGUMENT,"Cloanthus conqueror, and with verdant bay"
4811,ARGUMENT,AEneas crowns him. To each crew he shares
4812,ARGUMENT,"Three steers and wine, and, to recall the day,"
4813,ARGUMENT,A silver talent bids them bear away.
4814,ARGUMENT,"Choice honours to the captains next are told,"
4815,ARGUMENT,"A scarf he gives the victor, rich and gay,"
4816,ARGUMENT,"Twice-fringed with purple, glorious to behold,"
4817,ARGUMENT,Whose Melibaean dye meanders round the gold.
4818,ARGUMENT,
4819,ARGUMENT,"XXXIV. Inwoven there, behold the kingly boy,"
4820,ARGUMENT,"Fair Ganymede, pursues the flying deer"
4821,ARGUMENT,"On Ida and the wooded heights of Troy,"
4822,ARGUMENT,"Swift-footed, glorying with uplifted spear,"
4823,ARGUMENT,So keen the panting of his heart ye hear.
4824,ARGUMENT,"Down swoops Jove's armour-bearer, and on high"
4825,ARGUMENT,With taloned claws hath trussed him. Vainly here
4826,ARGUMENT,His aged guardians lift their heads and cry;
4827,ARGUMENT,"The faithful dogs look up, and fiercely bay the sky."
4828,ARGUMENT,
4829,ARGUMENT,"XXXV. A goodly hauberk to the next he gave,"
4830,ARGUMENT,"With polished rings and triple chain of gold,"
4831,ARGUMENT,"Torn by his own hands from Demoleos brave,"
4832,ARGUMENT,"Beneath high Troy, where Simois swiftly rolled,"
4833,ARGUMENT,"The warrior's glory and defence, to hold."
4834,ARGUMENT,"Phegeus and Sagaris, with all their might,"
4835,ARGUMENT,"Two stalwart slaves, scarce bore it, fold on fold,"
4836,ARGUMENT,"That coat of mail, wherein Demoleos dight,"
4837,ARGUMENT,"Trod down the ranks of Troy, and put his foes to flight."
4838,ARGUMENT,
4839,ARGUMENT,"XXXVI. Last comes the third: two brazen caldrons fine,"
4840,ARGUMENT,"Two cups of silver doth the prince bestow,"
4841,ARGUMENT,Rough-chased with imagery of choice design.
4842,ARGUMENT,"Each had his prize, and glorying forth they go,"
4843,ARGUMENT,"With purple ribbons on their brows, when lo!"
4844,ARGUMENT,"Scarce torn with effort from the rock's embrace,"
4845,ARGUMENT,"Oarless, and short of oarsmen by a row,"
4846,ARGUMENT,"Home comes Sergestus, and in rueful case"
4847,ARGUMENT,"Drives his dishonoured bark, left hindmost in the race."
4848,ARGUMENT,
4849,ARGUMENT,"XXXVII. As when an adder, whom athwart the way"
4850,ARGUMENT,"Some wheel hath crushed, or traveller, passing by,"
4851,ARGUMENT,"Maimed with a stone, as unaware he lay,"
4852,ARGUMENT,"And left sore mangled, on the point to die,"
4853,ARGUMENT,"In vain his coils would lengthen, fain to fly:"
4854,ARGUMENT,"One half erect, his burning eyes around"
4855,ARGUMENT,"He darts, and lifts his hissing throat on high,"
4856,ARGUMENT,"Defiant, half still writhes upon the ground,"
4857,ARGUMENT,"Self-twined in tortuous knots, and crippled by the wound:"
4858,ARGUMENT,
4859,ARGUMENT,"XXXVIII. So slowly rows the Centaur, yet anon"
4860,ARGUMENT,"They set the sails, and loose the spreading sheet,"
4861,ARGUMENT,And crowd full canvas; and the port is won.
4862,ARGUMENT,"Glad is AEneas, and he joys to greet"
4863,ARGUMENT,His friends brought safely and his ships complete.
4864,ARGUMENT,"So to Sergestus, for his portion due,"
4865,ARGUMENT,"He gives fair Pholoe, a slave of Crete,"
4866,ARGUMENT,"Twins at her breast, two sons of loveliest hue,"
4867,ARGUMENT,"And well Minerva's works, the weaving art, she knew."
4868,ARGUMENT,
4869,ARGUMENT,"XXXIX. This contest o'er, the good AEneas sought"
4870,ARGUMENT,"A grassy plain, with waving forests crowned"
4871,ARGUMENT,"And sloping hills--fit theatre for sport,"
4872,ARGUMENT,Where in the middle of the vale was found
4873,ARGUMENT,"A circus. Hither comes he, ringed around"
4874,ARGUMENT,"With thousands, here, amidst them, throned on high"
4875,ARGUMENT,"In rustic state, he seats him on a mound,"
4876,ARGUMENT,"And all who in the footrace list to vie,"
4877,ARGUMENT,"With proffered gifts invites, and tempts their souls to try."
4878,ARGUMENT,
4879,ARGUMENT,"XL. In crowds the Teucrians and Sicanians come,"
4880,ARGUMENT,"First, Nisus and Euryalus. None so fair"
4881,ARGUMENT,"As young Euryalus, in youthful bloom"
4882,ARGUMENT,And beauty; none with Nisus could compare
4883,ARGUMENT,In pure affection for a youth so rare.
4884,ARGUMENT,"Here stood Diores, famous for his speed,"
4885,ARGUMENT,"A prince of Priam's lineage; Salius there,"
4886,ARGUMENT,"And Patron, this of Acarnanian seed,"
4887,ARGUMENT,That of Arcadian birth and Tegeaean breed.
4888,ARGUMENT,
4889,ARGUMENT,"XLI. Came from Trinacria two champions bold,"
4890,ARGUMENT,"Young Helymus and Panopes, well-tried"
4891,ARGUMENT,"In woodland craft, and followers of old"
4892,ARGUMENT,"Acestes; came full many a youth beside,"
4893,ARGUMENT,"Whose fame shines dimly, or whose name hath died."
4894,ARGUMENT,"Then cries AEneas 'mid the concourse: ""Ho!"
4895,ARGUMENT,"Give heed, for surely shall my word abide,"
4896,ARGUMENT,"Blithe be your hearts, for none among you--no,"
4897,ARGUMENT,Not one of all this crowd--without a gift shall go.
4898,ARGUMENT,
4899,ARGUMENT,"XLII. ""To each, a common largess, be a pair"
4900,ARGUMENT,"Of Gnossian javelins and an axe decreed,"
4901,ARGUMENT,With haft of silver chasings. Three shall wear
4902,ARGUMENT,"Crowns of pale olive. For the victor's need,"
4903,ARGUMENT,"Adorned with trappings, stands a noble steed."
4904,ARGUMENT,"A quiver, worn by Amazon of old,"
4905,ARGUMENT,"With Thracian arrows, for the next in speed,"
4906,ARGUMENT,Clasped with a gem and belted with bright gold.
4907,ARGUMENT,"The third this Argive helm, fit recompense, shall hold."""
4908,ARGUMENT,
4909,ARGUMENT,"XLIII. He spake, and at the signal forth they burst"
4910,ARGUMENT,"Together, like a storm-cloud, from the base,"
4911,ARGUMENT,With eager eyes set goalward. Nisus first
4912,ARGUMENT,"Darts off, and, bounding with the South-wind's pace,"
4913,ARGUMENT,"And swift as winged lightning, leads the race."
4914,ARGUMENT,"Next, but the next with many a length between,"
4915,ARGUMENT,"Comes Salius; then, behind him, third in place,"
4916,ARGUMENT,Euryalus; then Helymus is seen;
4917,ARGUMENT,"And lo! Diores last, comes flying along the green."
4918,ARGUMENT,
4919,ARGUMENT,"XLIV. Heel touching heel, on Helymus he hung,"
4920,ARGUMENT,"Shoulder to shoulder. But a rood beside,"
4921,ARGUMENT,"And, slipping past him, foremost he had sprung,"
4922,ARGUMENT,"And solved a doubt by winning. Side by side,"
4923,ARGUMENT,"The last lap reached, with many a labouring stride"
4924,ARGUMENT,"And breathless effort to the post they strain,"
4925,ARGUMENT,When lo! chance-tripping where the sward is dyed
4926,ARGUMENT,"With slippery blood of oxen newly slain,"
4927,ARGUMENT,"Down luckless Nisus slides, and sprawls upon the plain."
4928,ARGUMENT,
4929,ARGUMENT,"XLV. Stumbling, he felt the tottering knees give way."
4930,ARGUMENT,With shouts of triumph on his lips he falls
4931,ARGUMENT,Prone in the gore and in the miry clay.
4932,ARGUMENT,"E'en then, his love remembering, he recalls"
4933,ARGUMENT,"Euryalus. Across the track he crawls,"
4934,ARGUMENT,"Then, scrambling up from out the quagmire, flies"
4935,ARGUMENT,At Salius. In the dust proud Salius sprawls.
4936,ARGUMENT,"Forth darts Euryalus, 'mid cheers and cries,"
4937,ARGUMENT,"Hailed, through his helping friend, the winner of the prize."
4938,ARGUMENT,
4939,ARGUMENT,"XLVI. The second prize to Helymus, the third"
4940,ARGUMENT,Falls thus to brave Diores.--Now the heat
4941,ARGUMENT,"Was o'er, when Salius with his clamouring stirred"
4942,ARGUMENT,"Troy's seated elders, furious with defeat,"
4943,ARGUMENT,"And claimed the prize, as wrested by a cheat."
4944,ARGUMENT,"Tears aid Euryalus, and favour pleads"
4945,ARGUMENT,"His worth, more winsome in a form so sweet,"
4946,ARGUMENT,"And loudly, too, Diores intercedes."
4947,ARGUMENT,"Lost were his own last prize, if Salius' claim succeeds."
4948,ARGUMENT,
4949,ARGUMENT,"XLVII. ""Boys,"" said the good AEneas, ""the award"
4950,ARGUMENT,"Is fixt, and no man shall the palm withhold."
4951,ARGUMENT,"Yet be it mine to cheer a friend ill-starred."""
4952,ARGUMENT,"He spake, and Salius with a gift consoled,"
4953,ARGUMENT,"A Moorish lion's hide, with claws of gold"
4954,ARGUMENT,And shaggy hair. Then Nisus with a frown:
4955,ARGUMENT,"""If gifts so great a vanquished man may hold,"
4956,ARGUMENT,"If falls win pity, and defeat renown,"
4957,ARGUMENT,"What prize shall Nisus gain, whose merit earned the crown?"
4958,ARGUMENT,
4959,ARGUMENT,"XLVIII. ""Ay, who had won, had Chance not interfered,"
4960,ARGUMENT,"And baffled me, like Salius? Look,"" he said,"
4961,ARGUMENT,"And pointed to his limbs and forehead, smeared"
4962,ARGUMENT,"With ordure. Smiling, the good Sire surveyed"
4963,ARGUMENT,His piteous plight and raiment disarrayed;
4964,ARGUMENT,"Then forth he bade a glittering shield be borne,"
4965,ARGUMENT,"Which Didymaon's workmanship had made,"
4966,ARGUMENT,From Neptune's temple by the Danaans torn.
4967,ARGUMENT,"This prize he gives the youth, his prowess to adorn."
4968,ARGUMENT,
4969,ARGUMENT,"XLIX. The race was ended, and the gifts assigned,"
4970,ARGUMENT,"When thus AEneas, as they thronged about,"
4971,ARGUMENT,"Addressed the crowd: ""Now, whosoe'er hath mind"
4972,ARGUMENT,"His nerve to venture, or whose heart is stout,"
4973,ARGUMENT,"Step forth, and don the gauntlets and strike out."""
4974,ARGUMENT,"He spake, and straightway, while the lists they clear,"
4975,ARGUMENT,"Sets forth the gifts, for him who wins the bout,"
4976,ARGUMENT,"Gilt-horned and garlanded, a comely steer,"
4977,ARGUMENT,"A sword and glittering helm, the loser's soul to cheer."
4978,ARGUMENT,
4979,ARGUMENT,"L.  At once, amid loud murmurs, to his feet"
4980,ARGUMENT,"Upsprang great Dares, who in olden day"
4981,ARGUMENT,Alone the haughty Paris dared to meet.
4982,ARGUMENT,"He, by the tomb where mightiest Hector lay,"
4983,ARGUMENT,"Huge Butes fought, who, glorying in the bay,"
4984,ARGUMENT,"And boasting Amycus' Bebrycian strain,"
4985,ARGUMENT,"Called for his match. But Dares heard him, yea,"
4986,ARGUMENT,And smote him. Headlong on the sandy plain
4987,ARGUMENT,"A lifeless corpse he rolled, and all his boasts were vain."
4988,ARGUMENT,
4989,ARGUMENT,"LI. Such Dares towers, and strides into the ring,"
4990,ARGUMENT,"With head erect, and shoulders broad and bare,"
4991,ARGUMENT,"And right and left his sinewy arms doth swing,"
4992,ARGUMENT,"And burning for a rival, beats the air."
4993,ARGUMENT,Where is his match? Not one of all will dare
4994,ARGUMENT,"To don the gloves. So, deeming none can stand"
4995,ARGUMENT,"Against him, flushed with triumph, then and there"
4996,ARGUMENT,"Before AEneas, grasping in his hand"
4997,ARGUMENT,"The heifer's horns, he cries in accents of command:"
4998,ARGUMENT,
4999,ARGUMENT,"LII. ""Son of a goddess, if none risks the fray,"
5000,ARGUMENT,How long shall Dares guerdonless remain?
5001,ARGUMENT,What end of standing? Must I wait all day?
5002,ARGUMENT,"Bring the prize hither."" Straight the Dardan train"
5003,ARGUMENT,"Shout for their champion, and his claim sustain."
5004,ARGUMENT,"Then to Entellus, seated at his side,"
5005,ARGUMENT,"Couched on the green grass, in reproachful strain"
5006,ARGUMENT,"Thus sternly spake Acestes, fired with pride,"
5007,ARGUMENT,"And fain, for manhood sake, his younger friend to chide:"
5008,ARGUMENT,
5009,ARGUMENT,"LIII. ""Entellus, once our bravest, but in vain,"
5010,ARGUMENT,"Can'st _thou_ sit tamely, with the field unfought,"
5011,ARGUMENT,And see this braggart glory in his gain?
5012,ARGUMENT,"Where is thy god, that Eryx? Hath he taught"
5013,ARGUMENT,Thine arm its vaunted cleverness for naught?
5014,ARGUMENT,"To us what booteth thy Trinacrian name,"
5015,ARGUMENT,"Thy spoil-hung house, thy roof with prizes fraught?"""
5016,ARGUMENT,"Entellus said: ""My spirit is the same."
5017,ARGUMENT,"Fear hath not quenched my fire, nor checked the love of fame."
5018,ARGUMENT,
5019,ARGUMENT,"LIV. ""But numbing age hath made the blood run cold,"
5020,ARGUMENT,And turned my strength to dulness and decay.
5021,ARGUMENT,"Had I the youth that stirred these bones of old,"
5022,ARGUMENT,"The youth _he_ boasts, no need of guerdon, nay,"
5023,ARGUMENT,Nor comely steer to tempt me to the fray.
5024,ARGUMENT,"Glory I care for, not a gift,"" he cried,"
5025,ARGUMENT,"And, rising, hurled into the ring midway"
5026,ARGUMENT,"Two ponderous gauntlets, stiff with hardened hide;"
5027,ARGUMENT,"These Eryx wore, these thongs around his wrists he tied."
5028,ARGUMENT,
5029,ARGUMENT,"LV. All stood amazed, so huge the weight, so vast,"
5030,ARGUMENT,"Sevenfold with lead and iron overlaid,"
5031,ARGUMENT,The bull's tough hide. E'en Dares shrank aghast.
5032,ARGUMENT,"Forth stepped AEneas, and the gauntlets weighed,"
5033,ARGUMENT,And to and fro the ponderous folds he swayed.
5034,ARGUMENT,Then gruffly spake the veteran once more:
5035,ARGUMENT,"""Ah! had ye seen great Hercules arrayed"
5036,ARGUMENT,"In arms like these, such gauntlets as he wore,"
5037,ARGUMENT,And watched the deadly fight waged here upon the shore!
5038,ARGUMENT,
5039,ARGUMENT,"LVI. ""These Eryx wore, thy brother, when that day"
5040,ARGUMENT,He faced Alcides in the strife;--see now
5041,ARGUMENT,"His blood and brains,--with these I dared the fray"
5042,ARGUMENT,"When better blood gave vigour, nor the snow"
5043,ARGUMENT,Of envious eld was sprinkled on my brow.
5044,ARGUMENT,"Still, if this Trojan doth these arms decline,"
5045,ARGUMENT,"And good AEneas and our host allow,"
5046,ARGUMENT,"Match we the fight. These gauntlets I resign,"
5047,ARGUMENT,"Put fear away, and doff those Trojan gloves of thine."""
5048,ARGUMENT,
5049,ARGUMENT,"LVII. So saying, Entellus from his shoulders flung"
5050,ARGUMENT,"His quilted doublet, and revealed to light"
5051,ARGUMENT,"The massive joints, the sinews firmly strung,"
5052,ARGUMENT,"The bones and muscles, and the limbs of might,"
5053,ARGUMENT,"And, like a giant, stood prepared for fight."
5054,ARGUMENT,"Two gloves for either champion, matched in weight,"
5055,ARGUMENT,"AEneas brings, and binds them firm and tight."
5056,ARGUMENT,"So, face to face, each eager and elate,"
5057,ARGUMENT,"Like-armed the rivals stand, on tiptoe for debate."
5058,ARGUMENT,
5059,ARGUMENT,"LVIII. Each from the blow the towering head draws back,"
5060,ARGUMENT,"Fearless, with arms uplifted to the skies."
5061,ARGUMENT,"Spars hand through hand, and tempts to the attack,"
5062,ARGUMENT,"One, nimbler-footed, on his youth relies;"
5063,ARGUMENT,Entellus' strength is in his limbs and size.
5064,ARGUMENT,"But the knees shake beneath him, and are slow,"
5065,ARGUMENT,And age the wanted energy denies.
5066,ARGUMENT,"He heaves for breath; thick pantings come and go,"
5067,ARGUMENT,"And shake the labouring breast, as hailing blow on blow."
5068,ARGUMENT,
5069,ARGUMENT,LIX. In vain they strive for mastery. Loud sound
5070,ARGUMENT,"Their hollow sides; the battered chests ring back,"
5071,ARGUMENT,As here and there the whistling strokes pelt round
5072,ARGUMENT,"Their ears and temples, and the jaw-bones crack."
5073,ARGUMENT,"Firm stands Entellus, though his knees are slack;"
5074,ARGUMENT,"Still in the same strained posture, he defies,"
5075,ARGUMENT,"Unmoved, the tempest of his foe's attack."
5076,ARGUMENT,Only his body and his watchful eyes
5077,ARGUMENT,"Slip from the purposed stroke, and shun the wished surprise."
5078,ARGUMENT,
5079,ARGUMENT,LX. As one who strives with battery to o'erthrow
5080,ARGUMENT,"A high-walled city, or close siege doth lay"
5081,ARGUMENT,Against some mountain-stronghold; even so
5082,ARGUMENT,"Sly Dares shifts, an opening to essay,"
5083,ARGUMENT,And vainly varies his assault each way.
5084,ARGUMENT,"On tiptoe stretched, Entellus, pricked with pride,"
5085,ARGUMENT,"Puts forth his right hand, with resistless sway"
5086,ARGUMENT,"Steep from his shoulder. But the foe, quick-ey'd,"
5087,ARGUMENT,"Foresees the coming blow, and lightly leaps aside."
5088,ARGUMENT,
5089,ARGUMENT,LXI. On empty air Entellus wastes his strength.
5090,ARGUMENT,"Down goes the giant, baulked of his design,"
5091,ARGUMENT,"Fallen like a giant, and lies stretched at length."
5092,ARGUMENT,"So, torn from earth, on Ida's height divine"
5093,ARGUMENT,"Or Erymanthus, falls the hollow pine."
5094,ARGUMENT,Up spring each rival's countrymen. Loud cheers
5095,ARGUMENT,"The welkin rend, and, bursting through the line,"
5096,ARGUMENT,"Forth runs Acestes, and his friend uprears,"
5097,ARGUMENT,Pitying his fallen worth and fellowship of years.
5098,ARGUMENT,
5099,ARGUMENT,"LXII. Fearless, unshaken, with his soul aflame"
5100,ARGUMENT,"For vengeance, up Entellus springs again,"
5101,ARGUMENT,And conscious valour and the sense of shame
5102,ARGUMENT,"Rouse all his strength as, burning with disdain,"
5103,ARGUMENT,"He drives huge Dares headlong o'er the plain,"
5104,ARGUMENT,"Now right, now left, keeps pummelling his foe;"
5105,ARGUMENT,"No stint, no stay; as rattling hailstones rain"
5106,ARGUMENT,"On roof-tops, so with many a ceaseless blow"
5107,ARGUMENT,"Each hand in turn he plies, and pounds him to and fro."
5108,ARGUMENT,
5109,ARGUMENT,LXIII. But good AEneas suffered not too far
5110,ARGUMENT,"The strife to rage, not let Entellus slake"
5111,ARGUMENT,"His wrath, but rescued Dares from the war,"
5112,ARGUMENT,"Sore-spent, and thus in soothing terms bespake,"
5113,ARGUMENT,"""Poor friend! what madness doth thy mind o'ertake?"
5114,ARGUMENT,Feel'st not that more than mortal is his aid?
5115,ARGUMENT,"The gods are with him, and thy cause forsake."
5116,ARGUMENT,"Yield then to heaven and desist.""--He said,"
5117,ARGUMENT,And with his voice straightway the deadly strife allayed.
5118,ARGUMENT,
5119,ARGUMENT,"LXIV. Then, stirred with pity, the Dardanian throng"
5120,ARGUMENT,Their vanquished kinsman from the contest bore.
5121,ARGUMENT,"His sick knees wearily he drags along,"
5122,ARGUMENT,"Feeble and helpless, for his wound is sore;"
5123,ARGUMENT,And loosened teeth and clots of curdled gore
5124,ARGUMENT,"Spout forth, as o'er his shoulders nods each way"
5125,ARGUMENT,"The drooping head. They lead him to the shore,"
5126,ARGUMENT,"His gifts, the sword and helmet; but the bay"
5127,ARGUMENT,"And bull Entellus takes, the victor of the day."
5128,ARGUMENT,
5129,ARGUMENT,"LXV. Forth steps the champion, glorying in the prize,"
5130,ARGUMENT,"Pride in his port, defiance on his brow."
5131,ARGUMENT,"""See, Goddess-born; ye Teucrians, mark,"" he cried,"
5132,ARGUMENT,"""What strength Entellus in his youth could show;"
5133,ARGUMENT,"How dire a doom ye warded from his foe."""
5134,ARGUMENT,"He spake and, standing opposite the bull,"
5135,ARGUMENT,"Swung back his arm, and, rising to the blow,"
5136,ARGUMENT,"Betwixt the horns with hardened glove smote full,"
5137,ARGUMENT,And back upon the brain drove in the splintered skull.
5138,ARGUMENT,
5139,ARGUMENT,"LXVI. Down drops the beast, and on the earth lies low,"
5140,ARGUMENT,"Quivering but dead. Then o'er him, as he lay,"
5141,ARGUMENT,"Entellus cries ""O Eryx, hear my vow."
5142,ARGUMENT,"This life, for Dares, I devote this day,"
5143,ARGUMENT,A nobler victim and a worthier prey.
5144,ARGUMENT,Accept it thou who taught'st this arm to wield
5145,ARGUMENT,The gloves of death. Unvanquished in the fray
5146,ARGUMENT,"These withered arms their latest offering yield,"
5147,ARGUMENT,"These gauntlets I resign, and here renounce the field."""
5148,ARGUMENT,
5149,ARGUMENT,"LXVII. Next cries AEneas to the crowd: ""Come now,"
5150,ARGUMENT,"Whoso hath mind in archer's feats to vie,"
5151,ARGUMENT,"Step forth, and prove his cunning with the bow"":"
5152,ARGUMENT,Then sets the prizes: on the beach hard by
5153,ARGUMENT,"With stalwart arms he rears a mast on high,"
5154,ARGUMENT,"Ta'en from Serestus' vessel, and thereto"
5155,ARGUMENT,"A fluttering pigeon with a string doth tie,"
5156,ARGUMENT,"Mark for their shafts. Around the rivals drew,"
5157,ARGUMENT,And in a brazen helm the gathered lots they threw.
5158,ARGUMENT,
5159,ARGUMENT,"LXIII. Out leap the names; cheers hail the first in place,"
5160,ARGUMENT,"Hippocoon, son of Hyrtacus renowned;"
5161,ARGUMENT,"Then Mnestheus, victor in the naval race,"
5162,ARGUMENT,"Mnestheus, his brows with olive wreath still crowned."
5163,ARGUMENT,Third in the casque Eurytion's lot is found
5164,ARGUMENT,"Thy brother, famous Pandarus, whose dart,"
5165,ARGUMENT,"Hurled at the Danaans, did the truce confound."
5166,ARGUMENT,"Last comes Acestes, for with dauntless heart"
5167,ARGUMENT,Still in the toils of youth the veteran claims his part.
5168,ARGUMENT,
5169,ARGUMENT,"LXIX. Forth step the marksmen, and with bows well-bent,"
5170,ARGUMENT,"Draw forth their arrows, and their aim prepare."
5171,ARGUMENT,"Loud twanged the cord, as first Hippocoon sent"
5172,ARGUMENT,"His feathered shaft, that through the flowing air"
5173,ARGUMENT,"Went whistling on, and pierced the mast, and there"
5174,ARGUMENT,"Stuck fast. The stout tree quivered, and the bird"
5175,ARGUMENT,"Flapped with her wings in terror and despair,"
5176,ARGUMENT,"Fluttering for freedom, and around were heard"
5177,ARGUMENT,"Shouts, as admiring joy the clamorous concourse stirred."
5178,ARGUMENT,
5179,ARGUMENT,"LXX. Next him stood Mnestheus, eager for the prize,"
5180,ARGUMENT,"And straight the bowstring to his breast updrew,"
5181,ARGUMENT,Aiming aloft. The lightning of his eyes
5182,ARGUMENT,"Went with the arrow, as he twanged the yew."
5183,ARGUMENT,Ah pity! Fortune sped the shaft untrue.
5184,ARGUMENT,"The bird he missed, but cut the flaxen ties"
5185,ARGUMENT,"That held the feet, and cleft the knots in two."
5186,ARGUMENT,"And forth, exulting, through the windy skies,"
5187,ARGUMENT,Into the darkening clouds the loosened captive flies.

5189,ARGUMENT,"LXXI. Then, quick as thought, his arrow on the string,"
5190,ARGUMENT,"Eurytion to his brother breathed a prayer,"
5191,ARGUMENT,"Marking the pigeon, as she clapped her wing"
5192,ARGUMENT,"Beneath a cloud, he pierced her. Breathless there"
5193,ARGUMENT,"She drops; her life is with the stars of air,"
5194,ARGUMENT,The bolt is in her breast. Acestes now
5195,ARGUMENT,"Alone remains; no palm is left to bear,"
5196,ARGUMENT,"Yet skyward shoots the veteran, proud to show"
5197,ARGUMENT,"What skill his hand can boast, the sounding of his bow."
5198,ARGUMENT,
5199,ARGUMENT,LXXII. Sudden a portent was revealed; how great
5200,ARGUMENT,"An augury, the future brought to light,"
5201,ARGUMENT,And frightening seers their omens sang too late.
5202,ARGUMENT,"Aloft, the arrow kindled in its flight,"
5203,ARGUMENT,"Then marked with shining trail its pathway bright,"
5204,ARGUMENT,"And, wasting, vanished into viewless air."
5205,ARGUMENT,"So stars, unfastened from the vault of night,"
5206,ARGUMENT,"Stream in the firmament with fiery glare,"
5207,ARGUMENT,And through the dark fling out a length of glittering hair.
5208,ARGUMENT,
5209,ARGUMENT,"LXXIII. Awed stand the men of Sicily and Troy,"
5210,ARGUMENT,"And pray the gods. AEneas owns the sign,"
5211,ARGUMENT,"And, heaping gifts, Acestes clasps with joy."
5212,ARGUMENT,"""Take, father, take; Jove's auspices divine"

5217,ARGUMENT,"Gave, as a pledge of love, to have it and to hold."""
5218,ARGUMENT,
5219,ARGUMENT,"LXXIV. So saying, with a garland of green bay"
5220,ARGUMENT,"He crowned his temples, and the prize conferred,"
5221,ARGUMENT,And named Acestes victor of the day.
5222,ARGUMENT,"Nor good Eurytion to the choice demurred,"
5223,ARGUMENT,"Nor grudged to see the veteran's claim preferred,"
5224,ARGUMENT,"Though his the prowess that the rest surpassed,"
5225,ARGUMENT,His shaft the one that struck the soaring bird.
5226,ARGUMENT,"The second, he who cut the cord, the last,"
5227,ARGUMENT,He who with feathered reed transfixed the tapering mast.
5228,ARGUMENT,
5229,ARGUMENT,"LXXV. But good AEneas, ere the games are done,"

5240,ARGUMENT,"Reining their steeds. In radiant files they fare,"
5241,ARGUMENT,And wondering murmurs from each host arise.
5242,ARGUMENT,All with stript leaves have bound the flowing hair.
5243,ARGUMENT,"Two cornel javelins, tipt with steel, they bear,"
5244,ARGUMENT,"Some, polished quivers; and a pliant chain"
5245,ARGUMENT,Of twisted gold around the neck they wear;
5246,ARGUMENT,Three companies--three captains scour the plain.
5247,ARGUMENT,"Twelve youths, behind each chief, compose the glittering train."
5248,ARGUMENT,
5249,ARGUMENT,"LXXVII. One shouting troop young Priam's lead obeys,"
5250,ARGUMENT,"Thy son, Polites, from his grandsire hight,"
5251,ARGUMENT,And born erelong Italia's fame to raise.
5252,ARGUMENT,"A dappled Thracian charger bears the knight,"
5253,ARGUMENT,His pasterns flecked and forehead starred with white.
5254,ARGUMENT,"Next Atys, whom the Atian line reveres,"
5255,ARGUMENT,"The youthful idol of a youth's delight,"
5256,ARGUMENT,So well Iulus loved him. Last appears
5257,ARGUMENT,"Iulus, first in grace and comeliest of his peers."
5258,ARGUMENT,
5259,ARGUMENT,LXXVIII. His a Sidonian charger; Dido fair
5260,ARGUMENT,This pledge and token of her love supplied.
5261,ARGUMENT,"Trinacrian horses his attendants bear,"
5262,ARGUMENT,"Acestes' gift. Their bosoms throb with pride,"
5263,ARGUMENT,"While Dardans, cheering, welcome as they ride"
5264,ARGUMENT,The sires that have been in the sons that are.
5265,ARGUMENT,"So, when before their kinsfolk on each side"
5266,ARGUMENT,"Their ranks had passed, Epytides afar"
5267,ARGUMENT,"Cracks the loud whip, and shouts the signal, as for war."

5269,ARGUMENT,"LXXIX. In equal bands the triple troops divide,"
5270,ARGUMENT,"Then turn, and rallying, with spears bent low,"
5271,ARGUMENT,"Charge at the call. Now back again they ride,"
5272,ARGUMENT,"Wheel round, and weave new courses to and fro,"
5273,ARGUMENT,"In armed similitude of martial show,"
5274,ARGUMENT,Circling and intercircling. Now in flight
5275,ARGUMENT,"They bare their backs, now turning, foe to foe,"
5276,ARGUMENT,"Level their lances to the charge, now plight"
5277,ARGUMENT,"The truce, and side by side in friendly league unite."
5278,ARGUMENT,
5279,ARGUMENT,LXXX. E'en as in Crete the Labyrinth of old
5280,ARGUMENT,"Between blind walls its secret hid from view,"
5281,ARGUMENT,"With wildering ways and many a winding fold,"
5282,ARGUMENT,"Wherein the wanderer, if the tale be true,"

5287,ARGUMENT,Cleave the Carpathian waves and distant Libya's main.
5288,ARGUMENT,
5289,ARGUMENT,"LXXXI. These feats Ascanius to his people showed,"

5291,ARGUMENT,"The ancient Latins in the pastime rode,"
5292,ARGUMENT,"Wherein the princely Dardan, as a boy,"
5293,ARGUMENT,Was wont his Trojan comrades to employ.
5294,ARGUMENT,"To Alban children from their sires it came,"
5295,ARGUMENT,"And mighty Rome took up the ""game of Troy,"""
5296,ARGUMENT,"And called the players ""Trojans,"" and the name"
5297,ARGUMENT,"Lives on, as sons renew the hereditary game."

5299,ARGUMENT,LXXXII. Thus far to blest Anchises they defrayed

5307,ARGUMENT,"Of myriad hues, unseen, the maiden hastes below."

5311,ARGUMENT,While far off on the solitary strand
5312,ARGUMENT,"The Trojan dames sat sorrowful, and o'er"
5313,ARGUMENT,"The deep sea gazed, and, gazing, evermore"
5314,ARGUMENT,"Wept for the Sire. ""Ah, woe! the fields of foam!"

5317,ARGUMENT,"A rest for sea-worn souls, for weary 'tis to roam!"""
5318,ARGUMENT,
5319,ARGUMENT,"LXXXIV. So, not unversed in mischief, from the skies"

5379,ARGUMENT,"XC. Then, by the monstrous prodigy dismayed,"
5380,ARGUMENT,"And driven by madness, forth the matrons fare"

5590,ARGUMENT,His steeds with golden harness yoked amain.
5591,ARGUMENT,"The bridle and the foaming bit he placed,"
5592,ARGUMENT,"To curb their fury, and outflung the rein."
5593,ARGUMENT,"Lightly he flies along the watery plain,"
5594,ARGUMENT,Borne in his azure chariot. Far and nigh
5595,ARGUMENT,Beneath his thundering wheels the heaving main
5596,ARGUMENT,"Sinks, and the waves are tranquil, and on high"

5611,ARGUMENT,"The crews, and biddeth them the masts uprear,"
5612,ARGUMENT,"And stretch the sheets. All, tacking, loose the brails"
5613,ARGUMENT,"Larboard or starboard, and let go the sails,"
5614,ARGUMENT,And square or sideways to the breeze incline

5621,ARGUMENT,"Stretched by his oar, along the bench at rest,"
5622,ARGUMENT,When lo! false Sleep his feathery wings extends.
5623,ARGUMENT,"To guiltless Palinurus he descends,"

5641,ARGUMENT,"His steadfast eyes, still watchful when behold!"
5642,ARGUMENT,"A slumberous bough the god revealed to view,"

5678,ARGUMENT,"and sacrifice to Apollo, asks access to the nether-world to visit"
5679,ARGUMENT,his father (1-162). He must first pluck for Proserpine the golden
5680,ARGUMENT,bough and bury a dead comrade (163-198). After the death and burial
5681,ARGUMENT,"of Misenus, AEneas finds and gathers the golden bough (199-261)."

5684,ARGUMENT,and the unburied dead (334-405). Palinurus approaches and entreats
5685,ARGUMENT,"burial. Passing by Charon and Cerberus, they see the phantoms of"
5686,ARGUMENT,"suicides, of children, of lovers, and experience Dido's disdain"
5687,ARGUMENT,(406-559). From Greek and Trojan shades Deiphobus is singled out to
5688,ARGUMENT,tell his story (560-644). The Sibyl hurries AEneas on past the
5689,ARGUMENT,"approach to Tartarus, describing by the way its rulers and its"
5690,ARGUMENT,"horrors. Finally, they reach Elysium and gain entrance (645-757)."
5691,ARGUMENT,"The search among the shades of the Blessed for Anchises, and the"
5692,ARGUMENT,meeting between father and son (758-828). Anchises explains the
5693,ARGUMENT,"mystery of the Transmigration of Souls, and the book closes with the"
5694,ARGUMENT,"revelation to AEneas of the future greatness of Rome, whose heroes,"
5695,ARGUMENT,"from the days of the kings to the times of Augustus, pass in"
5696,ARGUMENT,procession before him (829-1071). He is then dismissed through the

5704,ARGUMENT,"The vessels, and the round sterns line the land."
5705,ARGUMENT,"Forth on the shore, in eager haste to claim"
5706,ARGUMENT,"Hesperia's welcome, leaps a youthful band."
5707,ARGUMENT,"These search the flint-stones for the seeds of flame,"
5708,ARGUMENT,"Those point to new-found streams, or scour the woods for game."
5709,ARGUMENT,
5710,ARGUMENT,II. But good AEneas seeks the castled height
5711,ARGUMENT,"And temple, to the great Apollo dear,"
5712,ARGUMENT,"And the vast cave where, hidden far from sight"
5713,ARGUMENT,"Within her sanctuary dark and drear,"
5714,ARGUMENT,"Dwells the dread Sibyl, whom the Delian seer"
5715,ARGUMENT,Inspires with soul and wisdom to unfold
5716,ARGUMENT,"The things to come.--So now, approaching near"
5717,ARGUMENT,"Through Trivia's grove, the temple they behold,"
5718,ARGUMENT,"And entering, see the roof all glittering with gold."

5780,ARGUMENT,IX. She ceased: at once an icy chill ran through
5781,ARGUMENT,The sturdy Trojans. From his inmost heart
5782,ARGUMENT,"Thus prayed the King: ""O Phoebus, wont to view"

5795,ARGUMENT,"And thou, dread mistress of prophetic lore,"
5796,ARGUMENT,"Grant us--I ask but what is due by Fate,"
5797,ARGUMENT,Our promised realms--that on the Latian shore

5815,ARGUMENT,"Strives, like a frenzied Bacchant, in her cell,"
5816,ARGUMENT,To shake the mighty deity from her soul.
5817,ARGUMENT,"So much the more, her raging heart to quell,"
5818,ARGUMENT,"He tires the foaming mouth, and shapes her to his spell."
5819,ARGUMENT,
5820,ARGUMENT,"XIII. Then yawned the hundred gates, and every door,"
5821,ARGUMENT,"Self-opening suddenly, revealed the fane,"
5822,ARGUMENT,And through the air the Sibyl's answer bore:
5823,ARGUMENT,"""O freed from Ocean's perils, but in vain,"
5824,ARGUMENT,Worse evils yet upon the land remain.
5825,ARGUMENT,"Doubt not; Troy's sons shall reach Lavinium's shore,"
5826,ARGUMENT,And rule in Latium; so the Fates ordain.
5827,ARGUMENT,"Yet shall they rue their coming. Woes in store,"
5828,ARGUMENT,"Wars, savage wars, I see, and Tiber foam with gore."

5834,ARGUMENT,"Then oft shalt thou, sore straitened and forlorn,"
5835,ARGUMENT,All towns and tribes of Italy implore
5836,ARGUMENT,To grant thee shelter from the foemen's scorn.

5845,ARGUMENT,"So sang the Sibyl from her echoing fane,"
5846,ARGUMENT,"And, wrapping truth in mystery, made known"
5847,ARGUMENT,The dark enigmas of her frenzied strain.
5848,ARGUMENT,"So Phoebus plied the goad, and shook the maddening rein."
5849,ARGUMENT,
5850,ARGUMENT,"XVI. Soon ceased the fit, the foaming lips were still."
5851,ARGUMENT,"""O maiden,"" said AEneas, ""me no more"

6022,ARGUMENT,"Rough, shingly, yawning wide-mouthed to the day,"
6023,ARGUMENT,Sheltered from access by the lake's dark wave
6024,ARGUMENT,"And shadowing forests, gloomy as the grave."
6025,ARGUMENT,O'er that dread space no flying thing could ply
6026,ARGUMENT,Its wings unjeopardied (whence Grecians gave
6027,ARGUMENT,"The name ""Aornos""), such a stench on high"

6103,ARGUMENT,And like a flaming furnace stare his eyes.
6104,ARGUMENT,Hung in a loop around his shoulders lies

6121,ARGUMENT,"Takes these, now those, then thrusts the rest away,"
6122,ARGUMENT,And vainly for the distant bank they yearn.
6123,ARGUMENT,"Then spake AEneas, for with strange dismay"
6124,ARGUMENT,"He viewed the tumult, ""Prithee, maiden, say"
6125,ARGUMENT,What means this thronging to the river-side?
6126,ARGUMENT,"What seek the souls? Why separate, do they"
6127,ARGUMENT,"Turn back, while others sweep the leaden tide?"
6128,ARGUMENT,"Who parts the shades, what doom the difference can decide?"""

6146,ARGUMENT,"Orontes, joyless, tombless, whom of late,"
6147,ARGUMENT,"Sea-tost from Troy, the blustering South pursued,"
6148,ARGUMENT,And ship and crew at once whelmed in the rolling flood.

6150,ARGUMENT,"XLVI. There paced in sorrow Palinurus' ghost,"
6151,ARGUMENT,"Who, lately from the Libyan shore their guide,"
6152,ARGUMENT,"Watching the stars, headforemost from his post"
6153,ARGUMENT,"Had fallen, and perished in the wildering tide."

6174,ARGUMENT,"Upon the boundless waters I was tost,"
6175,ARGUMENT,And on the fourth dawn from a wave at last
6176,ARGUMENT,Descried Italia. Slowly to her coast

6179,ARGUMENT,
6180,ARGUMENT,"XLIX. ""When lo! the savage folk, with sword and stave,"

6212,ARGUMENT,The well-known land remembered by his name.
6213,ARGUMENT,"Thus on they journey, and the stream draw near;"
6214,ARGUMENT,"Whom when the Stygian boatman saw appear,"

6231,ARGUMENT,"""No guile these arms intend, nor open fight;"
6232,ARGUMENT,Fear not; still may the monster in his den

6234,ARGUMENT,And chaste Proserpine guard her uncle's right.
6235,ARGUMENT,"Duteous and brave, his father's shade to view,"

6237,ARGUMENT,"Of love so great is powerless to subdue,"
6238,ARGUMENT,"Mark this,""--and from her vest the fateful gift she drew."
6239,ARGUMENT,
6240,ARGUMENT,"LV. Down fell his wrath: the venerable bough,"

6273,ARGUMENT,"How gladly now, in upper air again,"
6274,ARGUMENT,Would they endure their poverty and pain!
6275,ARGUMENT,It may not be. The Fates their doom decide

7567,ARGUMENT,Meanwhile the Fury to the Trojans bent
7568,ARGUMENT,"Her flight; with wily eye she marked afar,"
7569,ARGUMENT,"With snares and steeds upon the chase intent,"
7570,ARGUMENT,Iulus. On his hounds at once she sent
7571,ARGUMENT,"A sudden madness, and fierce rage awoke"
7572,ARGUMENT,"To chase the stag, as with the well-known scent"
7573,ARGUMENT,She lured their nostrils.--Thus the feud outbroke;
7574,ARGUMENT,So small a cause of strife could rustic hearts provoke.
7575,ARGUMENT,
7576,ARGUMENT,"LXVI. Broad-antlered, beauteous was the stag, which erst"
7577,ARGUMENT,The sons of Tyrrheus (Tyrrheus kept whilere
7578,ARGUMENT,"The royal herd and pastures), fostering nursed,"
7579,ARGUMENT,"Snatched from the dam. Their sister, Silvia fair,"
7580,ARGUMENT,"Oft wreathed his horns, and oft with tender care"
7581,ARGUMENT,"She washed him, and his shaggy coat would comb."
7582,ARGUMENT,"So tamed, and trained his master's board to share,"
7583,ARGUMENT,The gentle favourite in the woods would roam;
7584,ARGUMENT,"Each night, how late soe'er, he sought the well-known home."
7585,ARGUMENT,
7586,ARGUMENT,"LXVII. Him the fierce hounds now startle far astray,"
7587,ARGUMENT,"As down the stream he floats, or, crouching low,"
7588,ARGUMENT,Rests on the green bank from the noontide ray.
7589,ARGUMENT,"Athirst for praise, Ascanius bends his bow;"
7590,ARGUMENT,"Loud whirs the arrow, for Fate aims the blow,"
7591,ARGUMENT,And cleaves his flank and belly. Homeward flies
7592,ARGUMENT,"The wounded creature, moaning in his woe."
7593,ARGUMENT,"Blood-stained, with piteous and imploring eyes,"
7594,ARGUMENT,"Like one who sues for life, he fills the house with cries."
7595,ARGUMENT,
7596,ARGUMENT,"LXVIII. Smiting the breast, poor Silvia calls for aid."
7597,ARGUMENT,"Forth rush the churls, scarce waiting her demand,"
7598,ARGUMENT,Roused by the Fury in the wood's still shade.
7599,ARGUMENT,"One grasps a club, another wields a brand;"
7600,ARGUMENT,Rage makes a weapon of what comes to hand.
7601,ARGUMENT,"Forth from his work ran Tyrrheus, who an oak"
7602,ARGUMENT,"Was cleaving with the wedge, and cheered the band."
7603,ARGUMENT,"His hand still grasped the hatchet for the stroke,"
7604,ARGUMENT,"And bitter wrath he breathed, and fierce the words he spoke."
7605,ARGUMENT,
7606,ARGUMENT,"LXIX. The Fury snatched the moment; forth she flew,"
7607,ARGUMENT,"And, perching on the cabin-roof, looked round,"
7608,ARGUMENT,And from the curved horn of the shepherds blew
7609,ARGUMENT,"A blast of Tartarus, that shook the ground,"
7610,ARGUMENT,And made the forests and the groves rebound
7611,ARGUMENT,"The infernal echoes. Trivia's lakes afar,"
7612,ARGUMENT,And Velia's fountains heard the dreadful sound;
7613,ARGUMENT,"The white waves heard it of the sulphurous Nar,"
7614,ARGUMENT,"And mothers clasped their babes, and trembled at the war."
7615,ARGUMENT,
7616,ARGUMENT,"LXX. Swift at the summons, as the trumpet brayed,"
7617,ARGUMENT,The sturdy shepherds arm them for the fray.
7618,ARGUMENT,"Swift pour the Trojans from their camp, to aid"
7619,ARGUMENT,"Ascanius. Lo! 'tis battle's stern array,"
7620,ARGUMENT,"No village brawl, where churls dispute the day"
7621,ARGUMENT,With charred oak-staves and cudgels. Broadswords clash
7622,ARGUMENT,"With broadswords, and War's harvest far away"
7623,ARGUMENT,"Stands, bristling black with iron, as they dash"
7624,ARGUMENT,"Together, and drawn swords in doubtful conflict flash."
7625,ARGUMENT,
7626,ARGUMENT,"LXXI. And brazen arms shoot many a blinding ray,"
7627,ARGUMENT,"Smit by the sun, as clouds that fill the sky,"
7628,ARGUMENT,"Disparting, show the splendours of the fray."
7629,ARGUMENT,"As when a light wind o'er the sea doth fly,"
7630,ARGUMENT,"And the wave whitens as the breeze goes by,"
7631,ARGUMENT,And by degrees the bosom of the deep
7632,ARGUMENT,"Heaves up and swells, till higher and more high"
7633,ARGUMENT,"The billows rise, and, gathering in a heap,"
7634,ARGUMENT,"From Ocean's caves mount up, and storm the ethereal steep."
7635,ARGUMENT,
7636,ARGUMENT,"LXXII. First falls the son of Tyrrheus, stretched in death,"
7637,ARGUMENT,Young Almo. In his throat the deadly bane
7638,ARGUMENT,"Stuck fast, and choked the humid pass of breath,"
7639,ARGUMENT,"And clipped the thin-spun life. There, too, is slain"
7640,ARGUMENT,"Grey-haired Galaesus, parleying but in vain."
7641,ARGUMENT,"More righteous none, though many around lie killed,"
7642,ARGUMENT,None wealthier did Ausonia's realm contain.
7643,ARGUMENT,"Five herds, five bleating flocks, his pastures filled,"
7644,ARGUMENT,And with a hundred ploughs his fruitful lands he tilled.
7645,ARGUMENT,
7646,ARGUMENT,"LXXIII. Thus while the conflict wavered on the plain,"
7647,ARGUMENT,"The Fury, pleased her triumph to survey,"
7648,ARGUMENT,"Her pledge fulfilled,--War crimsoned with the stain"
7649,ARGUMENT,"Of gore, and grim Death busy with his prey,--"
7650,ARGUMENT,"Swift from Hesperia wings her airy way,"
7651,ARGUMENT,"And proudly speaks to Juno: ""See, 'tis done;"
7652,ARGUMENT,"The discord perfect in the dolorous fray,"
7653,ARGUMENT,And War with all its miseries begun.
7654,ARGUMENT,"Now bid, forsooth, the foes plight friendship and be one."
7655,ARGUMENT,
7656,ARGUMENT,"LXXIV. ""Steeped are thy Trojans in Ausonian gore."
7657,ARGUMENT,"Yet speak, and more will I perform, if so"
7658,ARGUMENT,Thy purpose holds. Along the neighbouring shore
7659,ARGUMENT,"Each town shall hear the rumour of the foe,"
7660,ARGUMENT,"Each breast with frenzy for the strife shall glow,"
7661,ARGUMENT,"Till all bring aid, and fruitful is the land"
7662,ARGUMENT,"In deeds of blood.""--Then Juno: ""Nay, not so;"
7663,ARGUMENT,Enough of fraud and terror. Firmly stand
7664,ARGUMENT,"The causes of the feud; they battle hand to hand,"
7665,ARGUMENT,
7666,ARGUMENT,"LXXV. ""And fresh blood stains the weapons chance supplied."
7667,ARGUMENT,"Such joy the bridal to Latinus bear,"
7668,ARGUMENT,"And Venus' wondrous offspring, and his bride."
7669,ARGUMENT,But thou--for scarce Olympus' king would bear
7670,ARGUMENT,"Thy lawless roving in ethereal air,--"
7671,ARGUMENT,"Give place; myself will guide the rest aright."""
7672,ARGUMENT,Saturnia spoke; Alecto then and there
7673,ARGUMENT,"Her wings, that hiss with serpents, spreads for flight,"
7674,ARGUMENT,"And to Cocytus dives, and leaves the realms of light."
7675,ARGUMENT,
7676,ARGUMENT,"LXXVI. In mid Italia lies a vale renowned,"
7677,ARGUMENT,Amsanctus. Dark woods down the mountain grow
7678,ARGUMENT,This side and that; a torrent with the sound
7679,ARGUMENT,Of thunder roars among the rocks below.
7680,ARGUMENT,"There, black as night, an awful cave they show,"
7681,ARGUMENT,The gorge of Dis. Dread Acheron from beneath
7682,ARGUMENT,"Bursts in a whirlpool, with its waves of woe,"
7683,ARGUMENT,And jaws that gape with pestilential death.
7684,ARGUMENT,"There plunged the hateful Fiend, and earth and air took breath."
7685,ARGUMENT,
7686,ARGUMENT,"LXXVII. Nor less, meanwhile, Saturnia hastes to crown"
7687,ARGUMENT,The war's mad tumult. Home the shepherds bore
7688,ARGUMENT,Their dead from out the battle to the town.
7689,ARGUMENT,"Young Almo, and Galaesus, fouled with gore."
7690,ARGUMENT,"All bid Latinus witness, and implore"
7691,ARGUMENT,"The gods, and while the blood-cry calls for flame"
7692,ARGUMENT,"And slaughter, Turnus swells the wild uproar."
7693,ARGUMENT,What! he an outcast? Shall the Trojans claim
7694,ARGUMENT,"The realm, and bastards dare the Latin race to shame?"
7695,ARGUMENT,
7696,ARGUMENT,"LXXVIII. Then they, whose mothers through the pathless vales"
7697,ARGUMENT,"And forests, fired with Bacchic frenzy, ply"
7698,ARGUMENT,Their orgies--so Amata's name prevails--
7699,ARGUMENT,"Come forth, and, gathering from far and nigh,"
7700,ARGUMENT,"Weary the War-god with their clamorous cry,"
7701,ARGUMENT,"Till, thwarting Heaven's high purpose, each and all"
7702,ARGUMENT,"Omens at once and oracles defy,"
7703,ARGUMENT,"And swarm around Latinus in his hall,"
7704,ARGUMENT,"War now is all their wish, ""to arms"" the general call."
7705,ARGUMENT,
7706,ARGUMENT,"LXXIX. Firm stands the monarch as a sea-girt rock,"
7707,ARGUMENT,"A sea-girt rock against the roaring main,"
7708,ARGUMENT,"Which, spite of barking billows and the shock"
7709,ARGUMENT,"Of Ocean, doth its own huge mass sustain."
7710,ARGUMENT,"The foaming crags around it chafe in vain,"
7711,ARGUMENT,And back it flings the seaweed from its side.
7712,ARGUMENT,"Too weak at length their madness to restrain,"
7713,ARGUMENT,"For things move on as Juno's whims decide,"
7714,ARGUMENT,"Oft to the gods, and oft to empty air he cried."
7715,ARGUMENT,
7716,ARGUMENT,"LXXX. ""Ah me! the tempest hurries us along."
7717,ARGUMENT,"Fate grinds us sore. Poor Latins! ye must sate,"
7718,ARGUMENT,"Your blood must pay, the forfeit for your wrong."
7719,ARGUMENT,"Thee, Turnus, thee the avenging fiends await,"
7720,ARGUMENT,"Thou, too, the gods shalt weary, but too late."
7721,ARGUMENT,"My rest is won, and in the port I ride;"
7722,ARGUMENT,"Happy in all, had not an envious fate"
7723,ARGUMENT,"Denied a happy ending."" Thus he cried,"
7724,ARGUMENT,"And to his chamber fled, and flung the crown aside."
7725,ARGUMENT,
7726,ARGUMENT,"LXXXI. A custom in Hesperian Latium reigned,"
7727,ARGUMENT,"Which Alban cities kept with sacred care,"
7728,ARGUMENT,"And Rome, the world's great mistress, hath retained."
7729,ARGUMENT,"Thus still they wake the War-god, whensoe'er"
7730,ARGUMENT,"For Arabs or Hyrcanians they prepare,"
7731,ARGUMENT,"Or Getic tribes the tearful woes of war,"
7732,ARGUMENT,"Or push to Ind their distant arms, or dare"
7733,ARGUMENT,"To track the footsteps of the Morning star,"
7734,ARGUMENT,And claim their standards back from Parthia's hosts afar.
7735,ARGUMENT,
7736,ARGUMENT,"LXXXII. Twain are the Gates of War, to dreadful Mars"
7737,ARGUMENT,With awe kept sacred and religious pride.
7738,ARGUMENT,A hundred brazen bolts and iron bars
7739,ARGUMENT,"Shut fast the doors, and Janus stands beside."
7740,ARGUMENT,"Here, when the senators on war decide,"
7741,ARGUMENT,"The Consul, decked in his Quirinal pall"
7742,ARGUMENT,"And Gabine cincture, flings the portals wide,"
7743,ARGUMENT,"And cries to arms; the warriors, one and all,"
7744,ARGUMENT,With blare of brazen horns make answer to the call.
7745,ARGUMENT,
7746,ARGUMENT,LXXXIII. 'Twas thus that now Latinus they require
7747,ARGUMENT,"To dare AEneas' followers to the fray,"
7748,ARGUMENT,And ope the portals. But the good old Sire
7749,ARGUMENT,"Shrank from the touch, and, shuddering with dismay,"
7750,ARGUMENT,"Shunned the foul office, and abjured the day."
7751,ARGUMENT,"Then, downward darting from the skies afar,"
7752,ARGUMENT,Heaven's empress with her right hand wrenched away
7753,ARGUMENT,"The lingering bars. The grating hinges jar,"
7754,ARGUMENT,As back Saturnia thrusts the iron gates of War.
7755,ARGUMENT,
7756,ARGUMENT,LXXXIV. Then woke Ausonia from her sleep. Forth swarm
7757,ARGUMENT,"Footmen and horsemen, and in wild career"
7758,ARGUMENT,"Whirl up the dust. ""Arm,"" cry the warriors, ""arm!"""
7759,ARGUMENT,"With unctuous lard their polished shields they smear,"
7760,ARGUMENT,"And whet the axe, and scour the rusty spear."
7761,ARGUMENT,"Their banners wave, their trumpets sound the fight."
7762,ARGUMENT,"Five towns their anvils for the war uprear,"
7763,ARGUMENT,"Crustumium, Tibur, glorying in her might,"
7764,ARGUMENT,"Ardea, Atina strong, Antemnae's tower-girt height."
7765,ARGUMENT,
7766,ARGUMENT,"LXXXV. Lithe twigs of osier in their shields they weave,"
7767,ARGUMENT,"And shape the casque, and in the mould prepare"
7768,ARGUMENT,The brazen breastplate and the silver greave.
7769,ARGUMENT,"Scorned lie the spade, the sickle and the share,"
7770,ARGUMENT,Their fathers' falchions to the forge they bear.
7771,ARGUMENT,Now peals the clarion; through the host hath spread
7772,ARGUMENT,"The watch-word. Helmets from the walls they tear,"
7773,ARGUMENT,"And yoke the steeds. In triple gold arrayed,"
7774,ARGUMENT,"Each grasps the burnished shield, and girds the trusty blade."
7775,ARGUMENT,
7776,ARGUMENT,"LXXXVI. Now open Helicon; awake the strain,"
7777,ARGUMENT,"Ye Muses. Aid me, that the tale be told,"
7778,ARGUMENT,"What kings were roused, what armies filled the plain,"
7779,ARGUMENT,"What battles blazed, what men of valiant mould"
7780,ARGUMENT,Graced fair Italia in those days of old.
7781,ARGUMENT,"Aid ye, for ye are goddesses, and clear"
7782,ARGUMENT,"Can ye remember, and the tale unfold."
7783,ARGUMENT,"But faint and feeble is the voice we hear,"
7784,ARGUMENT,"A slender breath of Fame, that falters on the ear."
7785,ARGUMENT,
7786,ARGUMENT,LXXXVII. First came with armed men from Etruria's coast
7787,ARGUMENT,"Mezentius, scorner of the Gods. Next came"
7788,ARGUMENT,"His son, young Lausus, comeliest of the host,"
7789,ARGUMENT,"Save Turnus--Lausus, who the steed could tame,"
7790,ARGUMENT,And quell wild beasts and track the woodland game.
7791,ARGUMENT,A hundred warriors from Agylla's town
7792,ARGUMENT,He leads--ah vainly! though he died with fame.
7793,ARGUMENT,Proud had he been and worthy to have known
7794,ARGUMENT,"A nobler sire's commands, a nobler sire to own."
7795,ARGUMENT,
7796,ARGUMENT,"LXXXVIII. With conquering steeds triumphant o'er the mead,"
7797,ARGUMENT,"His chariot, crowned with palm-leaves, proudly wheeled"
7798,ARGUMENT,"The comely Aventinus, glorious seed"
7799,ARGUMENT,Of glorious Hercules; the blazoned shield
7800,ARGUMENT,His father's Hydra and her snakes revealed.
7801,ARGUMENT,"Him, when of old, the monstrous Geryon slain,"
7802,ARGUMENT,"The lord of Tiryns, victor of the field,"
7803,ARGUMENT,"Reached in his wanderings the Laurentian plain,"
7804,ARGUMENT,"And bathed in Tiber's stream the captured herds of Spain,"
7805,ARGUMENT,
7806,ARGUMENT,"LXXXIX. The priestess Rhea, in the secret shade"
7807,ARGUMENT,"Of wooded Aventine, brought forth to light,"
7808,ARGUMENT,A god commingling with a mortal maid.
7809,ARGUMENT,"With pikes and poles his followers join the fight,"
7810,ARGUMENT,"Their swords are sharp, their Sabine spears are bright."
7811,ARGUMENT,"Himself afoot, a lion's bristling hide"
7812,ARGUMENT,"With sharp teeth set in rows of glittering white,"
7813,ARGUMENT,"Swings o'er his forehead, as with eager stride,"
7814,ARGUMENT,"Clad in his father's cloak, he seeks the monarch's side."
7815,ARGUMENT,
7816,ARGUMENT,XC. Twin brothers came from Tibur--such the name
7817,ARGUMENT,"Tiburtus gave it--one Catillus hight,"
7818,ARGUMENT,"And one fierce Coras, each of Argive fame,"
7819,ARGUMENT,"Each in the van, where deadliest raves the fight."
7820,ARGUMENT,As when two cloud-born Centaurs in their might
7821,ARGUMENT,"From some tall mountain with swift strides descend,"
7822,ARGUMENT,"Steep Homole, or Othrys' snow-capt height;"
7823,ARGUMENT,"The thickets yield, trees crash, and branches bend,"
7824,ARGUMENT,As with resistless force the trampled woods they rend.
7825,ARGUMENT,
7826,ARGUMENT,"XCI. Nor lacked Praeneste's founder, Vulcan's child,"
7827,ARGUMENT,"Found on the hearthstone--if the tale be true,--"
7828,ARGUMENT,"Brave Caeculus, the Shepherds' monarch styled."
7829,ARGUMENT,"Forth from Praeneste swarmed the rustic crew,"
7830,ARGUMENT,"From Juno's Gabium to the fight they flew,"
7831,ARGUMENT,"From ice-cold Anio, swoln with wintry rain,"
7832,ARGUMENT,"From Hernic rocks, which mountain streams bedew,"
7833,ARGUMENT,"From fat Anagnia's pastures, from the plain"
7834,ARGUMENT,Where Amasenus rolls majestic to the main.
7835,ARGUMENT,
7836,ARGUMENT,XCII. With diverse arms they hasten to the war;
7837,ARGUMENT,"Not all can boast the clashing of the shield,"
7838,ARGUMENT,Not all the thunder of the rattling car.
7839,ARGUMENT,"These sling their leaden bullets o'er the field,"
7840,ARGUMENT,Those in each hand the deadly javelin wield.
7841,ARGUMENT,"With caps of fur their rugged brows are dight,"
7842,ARGUMENT,The tawny covering from the dark wolf peeled;
7843,ARGUMENT,"Bare is the left foot, as they march to fight,"
7844,ARGUMENT,"And, rough with raw bull's-hide, a sandal guards the right."
7845,ARGUMENT,
7846,ARGUMENT,"XCIII. Next came Messapus, tamer of the steed,"
7847,ARGUMENT,Great Neptune's son. Fire nor the steel's sharp stroke
7848,ARGUMENT,"Could lay him lifeless, so the Fates decreed."
7849,ARGUMENT,"Grasping his sword, a laggard race he woke,"
7850,ARGUMENT,"Disused to war, and tardy to provoke."
7851,ARGUMENT,"Behind him throng Fescennia's ranks to fight,"
7852,ARGUMENT,"Men from Flavinia, and Faliscum's folk,"
7853,ARGUMENT,"And those whom fair Capena's groves delight,"
7854,ARGUMENT,"Ciminius' mount and lake, and steep Soracte's height."
7855,ARGUMENT,
7856,ARGUMENT,"XCIV. With measured tramp, their monarch's praise they sing,"
7857,ARGUMENT,"Like snowy swans, the liquid clouds among,"
7858,ARGUMENT,"Which homeward from their feeding ply the wing,"
7859,ARGUMENT,"When o'er Cayster's marish, loud and long,"
7860,ARGUMENT,The echoes float of their melodious song.
7861,ARGUMENT,"None, sure, such countless multitudes would deem"
7862,ARGUMENT,The mail-clad warriors of an armed throng:
7863,ARGUMENT,"Nay, rather, like a dusky cloud they seem"
7864,ARGUMENT,"Of sea-fowl, landward driven with many a hoarse-voiced scream."
7865,ARGUMENT,
7866,ARGUMENT,"XCV. Lo, Clausus next; a mighty host he led,"
7867,ARGUMENT,"Himself a host. From Sabine sires he came,"
7868,ARGUMENT,"And Latium thence the Claudian house o'erspread,"
7869,ARGUMENT,When Romans first with Sabines dared to claim
7870,ARGUMENT,Coequal lordship and a share of fame.
7871,ARGUMENT,With Amiternus came Eretum's band;
7872,ARGUMENT,"From fair Velinus' dewy fields they came,"
7873,ARGUMENT,"From olive-crowned Mutusca, from the land"
7874,ARGUMENT,Where proud Nomentum's towers the fruitful plains command.
7875,ARGUMENT,
7876,ARGUMENT,XCVI. From the rough crags of Tetrica came down
7877,ARGUMENT,"Her hosts; they came from tall Severus' flank,"
7878,ARGUMENT,"From Foruli and fam'd Casperia's town,"
7879,ARGUMENT,"Wash'd by Himella's waves, and those who drank"
7880,ARGUMENT,"Of Fabaris, or dwelt on Tiber's bank."
7881,ARGUMENT,"Those, too, whom Nursia sendeth from the snows,"
7882,ARGUMENT,"And Horta's sons, in many an ordered rank,"
7883,ARGUMENT,"And tribes of Latin origin, and those"
7884,ARGUMENT,Between whose parted fields th' ill-omened Allia flows.
7885,ARGUMENT,
7886,ARGUMENT,"XCVII. As roll the billows on the Libyan deep,"
7887,ARGUMENT,When fierce Orion in the wintry main
7888,ARGUMENT,"Sinks, dark with tempests, and the waves upleap;"
7889,ARGUMENT,"As, parched with suns of summer, stands the grain"
7890,ARGUMENT,"On Hermus' fields, or Lycia's golden plain;"
7891,ARGUMENT,So countless swarm the multitudes around
7892,ARGUMENT,"Bold Clausus, and the wide air rings again"
7893,ARGUMENT,"With echoes, as their clashing shields resound,"
7894,ARGUMENT,And with the tramp of feet they shake the trembling ground.
7895,ARGUMENT,
7896,ARGUMENT,"XCVIII. There Agamemnon's kinsman yokes his steeds,"
7897,ARGUMENT,"Halaesus. Trojans were his foes, his friend"
7898,ARGUMENT,"Was Turnus. Lo, a thousand tribes he leads;"
7899,ARGUMENT,"Those who on Massic hills the vineyards tend,"
7900,ARGUMENT,Those whom Auruncans from their mountains send.
7901,ARGUMENT,"From Sidicinum and her neighbouring plain,"
7902,ARGUMENT,"From Cales, from Volturnus' shoals they wend."
7903,ARGUMENT,"From steep Saticulum the sturdy swain,"
7904,ARGUMENT,"Fierce for the fray, comes down and joins the Oscan train."
7905,ARGUMENT,
7906,ARGUMENT,"XCIX. Light barbs they fling, from pliant thongs of hide,"
7907,ARGUMENT,"A leathern target o'er the left is strung,"
7908,ARGUMENT,"And short, curved daggers the close fight decide."
7909,ARGUMENT,"Nor, OEbalus, those gallant hosts among,"
7910,ARGUMENT,"Shalt thou go nameless, and thy praise unsung,"
7911,ARGUMENT,"Thou, from old Telon, as the tale hath feigned,"
7912,ARGUMENT,"And beauteous Sebethis, the wood-nymph, sprung,"
7913,ARGUMENT,O'er Teleboan Caprea when he reigned;
7914,ARGUMENT,But Caprea's narrow realm proud OEbalus disdained.
7915,ARGUMENT,
7916,ARGUMENT,"C.  Far stretched his rule; Sarrastians owned his sway,"
7917,ARGUMENT,"And they, whose lands the Sarnian waters drain,"
7918,ARGUMENT,"And they, who till Celenna's fields, and they"
7919,ARGUMENT,"Whom Batulum and Rufrae's walls contain,"
7920,ARGUMENT,And where through apple-orchards o'er the plain
7921,ARGUMENT,Shines fair Abella. Deftly can they wield
7922,ARGUMENT,Their native arms; the Teuton's lance they strain;
7923,ARGUMENT,"Bark helmets guard them, from the cork-tree peeled,"
7924,ARGUMENT,"And brazen are their swords, and brazen every shield."
7925,ARGUMENT,
7926,ARGUMENT,"CI. From Nersa's hills, by prosperous arms renowned,"
7927,ARGUMENT,"Comes Ufens, with his AEquians, in array."
7928,ARGUMENT,Rude huntsmen these; in arms the stubborn ground
7929,ARGUMENT,"They till, themselves as stubborn. Day by day"
7930,ARGUMENT,"They snatch fresh plunder, and they live by prey."
7931,ARGUMENT,"There, too, brave Umbro, of Marruvian fame,"
7932,ARGUMENT,"Sent by his king Archippus, joins the fray."
7933,ARGUMENT,"Around his helmet, for in arms he came,"
7934,ARGUMENT,The auspicious olive's leaves the sacred priest proclaim.
7935,ARGUMENT,
7936,ARGUMENT,CII. The rank-breath'd Hydra and the viper's rage
7937,ARGUMENT,With hand and voice he lulled asleep; his art
7938,ARGUMENT,"Their bite could heal, their fury could assuage."
7939,ARGUMENT,Alas! no medicine can heal the smart
7940,ARGUMENT,Wrought by the griding of the Dardan dart.
7941,ARGUMENT,"Nor Massic herbs, nor slumberous charms avail"
7942,ARGUMENT,"To cure the wound, that rankles in his heart."
7943,ARGUMENT,"Ah, hapless! thee Anguitia's bowering vale,"
7944,ARGUMENT,Thee Fucinus' clear waves and liquid lakes bewail!
7945,ARGUMENT,
7946,ARGUMENT,"CIII. Next came to war Hippolytus' fair child,"
7947,ARGUMENT,"The comely Virbius, whom Aricia bore"
7948,ARGUMENT,"Amid Egeria's grove, where rich and mild"
7949,ARGUMENT,Stands Dian's altar on the meadowy shore.
7950,ARGUMENT,For when (Fame tells) Hippolytus of yore
7951,ARGUMENT,"Was slain, the victim of a stepdame's spite,"
7952,ARGUMENT,"And, torn by frightened horses, quenched with gore"
7953,ARGUMENT,"His father's wrath, famed Paeon's herbs of might"
7954,ARGUMENT,And Dian's fostering love restored him to the light.
7955,ARGUMENT,
7956,ARGUMENT,"CIV. Wroth then was Jove, that one of mortal clay"
7957,ARGUMENT,"Should rise by mortal healing from the grave,"
7958,ARGUMENT,"And change the nether darkness for the day,"
7959,ARGUMENT,"And him, whose leechcraft thus availed to save,"
7960,ARGUMENT,Hurled with his lightning to the Stygian wave.

8026,ARGUMENT,"AEneas sacrifices the white sow and her litter to Juno, and reaches"
8027,ARGUMENT,Evander's city Pallanteum--the site of Rome (19-117). AEneas and
8028,ARGUMENT,Evander meet and feast together. The story of Cacus and the praises
8029,ARGUMENT,of Hercules are told and sung. Evander shows his city to AEneas
8030,ARGUMENT,(118-432). Venus asks and obtains from Vulcan divine armour for her
8031,ARGUMENT,son (433-531). At daybreak Evander promises AEneas further succour.
8032,ARGUMENT,Their colloquy is interrupted by a sign from heaven (532-630).
8033,ARGUMENT,Despatches are sent to Ascanius and prayers for aid to the Tuscans.

8043,ARGUMENT,"Signalled the strife, and bade the war-horns bray,"
8044,ARGUMENT,"And stirred the mettled steeds, and woke the war,"
8045,ARGUMENT,Hearts leaped at once; all Latium swore that day

8053,ARGUMENT,"His aid, and tell how Teucrians hold the land;"

8055,ARGUMENT,And claims the throne his vaunted Fates demand.

8121,ARGUMENT,
8122,ARGUMENT,"IX. So saying, the Stream-god dived beneath the flood,"

8125,ARGUMENT,"And eastward gazing at the dawning light,"

8145,ARGUMENT,"White, with her litter of the self-same hue."
8146,ARGUMENT,"Her good AEneas, as an offering due,"
8147,ARGUMENT,"To Juno, mightiest of all powers divine,"
8148,ARGUMENT,"Yea, e'en to thee, dread Juno, caught and slew,"
8149,ARGUMENT,"And lit the altars and outpoured the wine,"
8150,ARGUMENT,And left the dam and brood together at the shrine.
8151,ARGUMENT,
8152,ARGUMENT,"XII. All night the Tiber stayed his swelling flood,"
8153,ARGUMENT,"And with hushed wave, recoiling from the main,"
8154,ARGUMENT,"Calm as some pool or quiet lake, he stood"
8155,ARGUMENT,"And smoothed his waters like a liquid plain,"
8156,ARGUMENT,That not an oar should either strive or strain.
8157,ARGUMENT,"Thus on they go; smooth glides the bark of pine,"
8158,ARGUMENT,Borne with glad shouts; and ever and again
8159,ARGUMENT,"The woods and waters wonder, as the line"
8160,ARGUMENT,"Of painted keels goes by, with arms of glittering shine."
8161,ARGUMENT,
8162,ARGUMENT,"XIII. All night and day outwearying, they steer"

8164,ARGUMENT,With green trees shadowing the tranquil mere.
8165,ARGUMENT,"Now flamed the sun in the meridian high,"
8166,ARGUMENT,"When walls afar and citadel they spy,"
8167,ARGUMENT,And scattered roofs. Where now the power of Rome
8168,ARGUMENT,"Hath made her stately structures mate the sky,"
8169,ARGUMENT,Then poor and lowly stood Evander's home.
8170,ARGUMENT,"Thither their prows are turned, and to the town they come."
8171,ARGUMENT,
8172,ARGUMENT,"XIV. That day, Arcadia's monarch, in a grove"
8173,ARGUMENT,"Before the town, a solemn feast had planned"
8174,ARGUMENT,To Hercules and all the gods above.
8175,ARGUMENT,"His son, young Pallas, and a youthful band,"
8176,ARGUMENT,"And humble senators around him stand,"
8177,ARGUMENT,"Each offering incense, and the warm, fresh blood"
8178,ARGUMENT,"Still smokes upon the shrines, when, hard at hand,"
8179,ARGUMENT,"They see the tall ships, through the shadowy wood,"
8180,ARGUMENT,Glide up with silent oars along the sacred flood.
8181,ARGUMENT,
8182,ARGUMENT,"XV. Scared by the sudden sight, all quickly rise"
8183,ARGUMENT,"And quit the board. But Pallas, bold of cheer,"
8184,ARGUMENT,Bids them not break the worship. Forth he flies
8185,ARGUMENT,"To meet the strangers, as their ships appear,"
8186,ARGUMENT,His right hand brandishing a glittering spear.
8187,ARGUMENT,"""Gallants,"" he hails them from a mound afar,"
8188,ARGUMENT,"""What drove you hither by strange ways to steer?"

8193,ARGUMENT,"A branch of olive, and bespake him fair:"
8194,ARGUMENT,"""Troy's sons ye see, by Latin pride expelled."
8195,ARGUMENT,'Gainst Latin enemies these arms we bear.

8197,ARGUMENT,Choice Dardan chiefs his friendship come to claim.
8198,ARGUMENT,"His aid we ask for, and his arms would share."""
8199,ARGUMENT,"He ceased, and wonder and amazement came"
8200,ARGUMENT,"On Pallas, struck with awe to hear the mighty name."
8201,ARGUMENT,
8202,ARGUMENT,"XVII. ""Whoe'er thou art, hail, stranger,"" he replied,"
8203,ARGUMENT,"""Step forth, and to my father tell thy quest,"
8204,ARGUMENT,"And take the welcome that true hearts provide."""
8205,ARGUMENT,"Forth as he leaped, the Dardan's hand he pressed,"
8206,ARGUMENT,"And, pressing, held it, and embraced his guest."
8207,ARGUMENT,"So from the river through the grove they fare,"
8208,ARGUMENT,"And reach the place, where, feasting with the rest,"
8209,ARGUMENT,They find Evander. Him with speeches fair
8210,ARGUMENT,"AEneas hails, and hastes his errand to declare."
8211,ARGUMENT,
8212,ARGUMENT,"XVIII. ""O best of Greeks, whom thus with olive bough"

8226,ARGUMENT,"Your sire is Mercury, whom Maia fair"
8227,ARGUMENT,On chill Cyllene's summit bore of old;
8228,ARGUMENT,"And Maia's sire, if aught of truth we hear,"
8229,ARGUMENT,"Was Atlas, he who doth the spheres uphold."

8238,ARGUMENT,Their conquering arms shall stretch from shore to shore.

8240,ARGUMENT,"Stout hearts, and manhood proved in many a hard essay."""
8241,ARGUMENT,
8242,ARGUMENT,XXI. He ceased. Long while Evander marked with joy
8243,ARGUMENT,"His face and eyes, and scanned through and through,"
8244,ARGUMENT,"Then spake: ""O bravest of the sons of Troy!"
8245,ARGUMENT,"What joy to greet thee; thine the voice, the hue,"
8246,ARGUMENT,"The face of great Anchises, whom I knew."
8247,ARGUMENT,"Well I remember, how, in days forepast,"
8248,ARGUMENT,"Old Priam came to Salamis, to view"
8249,ARGUMENT,"His sister's realms, Hesione's, and passed"
8250,ARGUMENT,"To far Arcadia, chilled with many a Northern blast."
8251,ARGUMENT,
8252,ARGUMENT,"XXII. ""Scarce o'er my cheeks the callow down had crept,"
8253,ARGUMENT,"With wondering awe I viewed the Trojan train,"
8254,ARGUMENT,And gazed at Priam. But Anchises stepped
8255,ARGUMENT,The tallest. Boyish ardour made me fain
8256,ARGUMENT,"To greet the hero, and his hand to strain."
8257,ARGUMENT,"I ventured, and to Pheneus brought my guest."
8258,ARGUMENT,"A Lycian case of arrows, bridles twain,"
8259,ARGUMENT,"All golden--Pallas holds them,--and a vest"
8260,ARGUMENT,And scarf of broidered gold his parting thanks expressed.
8261,ARGUMENT,
8262,ARGUMENT,"XXIII. ""Take then the hand thou seekest; be it thine,"
8263,ARGUMENT,The plighted pact; and when to-morrow's ray
8264,ARGUMENT,"Shall chase the shadows, and the dawn shall shine,"
8265,ARGUMENT,"Aid will I give you, and due stores purvey,"
8266,ARGUMENT,And send you hence rejoicing on your way.
8267,ARGUMENT,"Meanwhile, since Heaven forbids us to postpone"
8268,ARGUMENT,"These yearly rites, and we are friends, be gay"
8269,ARGUMENT,"And share with us the banquet. Sit ye down,--"
8270,ARGUMENT,"Behold, the boards are spread,--and make the feast your own."""
8271,ARGUMENT,
8272,ARGUMENT,"XXIV. He spake, and back, at his command, they bring"
8273,ARGUMENT,"The food and wine. The chiefs, in order meet,"
8274,ARGUMENT,"Along the grass he ranges, and their king"
8275,ARGUMENT,Leads to his throne; of maple was the seat;
8276,ARGUMENT,A lion's hide lay bristling at his feet.
8277,ARGUMENT,"Youths and the altar's minister bring wine,"
8278,ARGUMENT,"And heap the bread, and serve the roasted meat."
8279,ARGUMENT,"On lustral entrails and the bull's whole chine,"
8280,ARGUMENT,"Couched round the Trojan king, the Trojan warriors dine."
8281,ARGUMENT,
8282,ARGUMENT,"XXV. Then, when at last desire of food had ceased,"
8283,ARGUMENT,"Thus spake Evander: ""Lo, this solemn show,"
8284,ARGUMENT,"This sacred altar, and this ordered feast,"
8285,ARGUMENT,No idle witchwork are they. Well we know
8286,ARGUMENT,"The ancient gods. Saved from a fearful foe,"
8287,ARGUMENT,Each year the deed we celebrate. See there
8288,ARGUMENT,"Yon nodding crag; behold the rocks below,"
8289,ARGUMENT,"Tost in huge ruin, and the lonely lair,"
8290,ARGUMENT,"Scooped from the mountain's side, how wild the waste and bare!"

8292,ARGUMENT,"XXVI. ""There yawned the cavern, in the rock's dark womb,"
8293,ARGUMENT,"Wherein the monster Cacus dwelt of yore,"

8295,ARGUMENT,"But day by day the rank earth reeked with gore,"
8296,ARGUMENT,"And human faces, nailed above the door,"
8297,ARGUMENT,"Hung, foul and ghastly. From the loins he came"
8298,ARGUMENT,"Of Vulcan, and his huge mouth evermore"
8299,ARGUMENT,Spewed forth a torrent of Vulcanian flame;
8300,ARGUMENT,"Proudly he stalked the earth, and shook the world's fair frame."
8301,ARGUMENT,
8302,ARGUMENT,"XXVII. ""But time, in answer to our prayers, one day"
8303,ARGUMENT,"Brought aid,--a God to help us in our need."
8304,ARGUMENT,"Flushed with the death of Geryon, came this way"
8305,ARGUMENT,"Alcides, glorying in the victor's meed,"
8306,ARGUMENT,And hither drove his mighty bulls to feed.
8307,ARGUMENT,"These, pasturing in the valley, from his lair"

8312,ARGUMENT,"XXVIII. ""Then, lest their footprints should the track declare,"
8313,ARGUMENT,"Back by their tails he dragged the captured kine,"
8314,ARGUMENT,"With hoofs reversed, and shut them in his lair,"
8315,ARGUMENT,And whoso sought the cavern found no sign.
8316,ARGUMENT,"But when at last Amphitryon's son divine,"
8317,ARGUMENT,"His feasted herds, preparing to remove,"
8318,ARGUMENT,"Called from their pastures, and in long-drawn line,"

8323,ARGUMENT,"Lowed back, in answer to the sound, and broke"
8324,ARGUMENT,"The hopes of Cacus, and his theft was plain."
8325,ARGUMENT,Black choler in Alcides' breast awoke.
8326,ARGUMENT,"Grasping his arms and club of knotted oak,"
8327,ARGUMENT,"Straight to the sky-capt Aventine he hies,"
8328,ARGUMENT,"And scales the steep. Then, not till then, our folk"

8336,ARGUMENT,"And searched each way for access to his lair,"
8337,ARGUMENT,Grinding his teeth. Thrice round the mount he threw
8338,ARGUMENT,"His vengeful eyes, thrice strove from earth to tear"
8339,ARGUMENT,"The stone, and storm the threshold, thrice withdrew,"
8340,ARGUMENT,"And in the vale sat down, and nursed his wrath anew."

8346,ARGUMENT,"Tore from its roots, and headlong down the height"

8756,ARGUMENT,"Then to his comrades and the shore he wends,"
8757,ARGUMENT,"Arrays the crews, and takes the bravest there"
8758,ARGUMENT,To follow him in fight. The rest he sends
8759,ARGUMENT,"To young Ascanius down the stream, to bear"
8760,ARGUMENT,"News of his absent sire, and how the cause doth fare."
8761,ARGUMENT,
8762,ARGUMENT,"LXXIII. With steeds, to aid the Tuscans, they provide"
8763,ARGUMENT,The Teucrians. For AEneas forth is led
8764,ARGUMENT,"The choicest, with a tawny lion's hide,"
8765,ARGUMENT,"All glittering with gilded claws, bespread."
8766,ARGUMENT,"Now rumour through the little town hath sped,"
8767,ARGUMENT,"Of horsemen for the Tuscan king, with spear"
8768,ARGUMENT,"And shield for battle. Mothers, pale with dread,"
8769,ARGUMENT,"Heap vows on vows. The War-god, drawing near,"
8770,ARGUMENT,"Looms larger, and more close to danger draws the fear."
8771,ARGUMENT,
8772,ARGUMENT,"LXXIV. Then cries Evander, clinging, and with tears"
8773,ARGUMENT,"Insatiate, loth to see his Pallas go,"
8774,ARGUMENT,"""Ah! would but Jove bring back the bygone years,"
8775,ARGUMENT,As when beneath Praeneste long ago
8776,ARGUMENT,"I strowed the van, and laid their mightiest low,"
8777,ARGUMENT,"And burned their shields, and with this hand to Hell"
8778,ARGUMENT,"Hurled down King Erulus, the monstrous foe,"
8779,ARGUMENT,"To whom Feronia, terrible to tell,"
8780,ARGUMENT,"Three lives had given, and thrice to battle ere he fell."
8781,ARGUMENT,
8782,ARGUMENT,"LXXV. ""Twice up he rose, but thrice I slew the slain,"
8783,ARGUMENT,"Thrice of his life I robbed him, till he died,"
8784,ARGUMENT,"Thrice stripped his arms. O, were I such again,"
8785,ARGUMENT,"Danger, nor death, nor aught of ill beside,"
8786,ARGUMENT,"Sweet son, should ever tear me from thy side."
8787,ARGUMENT,"Ne'er had Mezentius then, the neighbouring lord,"
8788,ARGUMENT,"Dared thus to flout me, nor this arm defied."
8789,ARGUMENT,"Nor wrought such havoc and such crimes abhorred,"
8790,ARGUMENT,Nor made a weeping town thus widowed by the sword.
8791,ARGUMENT,
8792,ARGUMENT,"LXXVI. ""O Gods, and thou, who rulest earth and air,"
8793,ARGUMENT,"Great Jove, their mightiest, pity, I implore,"
8794,ARGUMENT,"Arcadia's King, and hear a father's prayer."
8795,ARGUMENT,"If Fate this happiness reserve in store,"
8796,ARGUMENT,"To gaze upon my Pallas' face once more,"
8797,ARGUMENT,"If living means to meet my son again,"
8798,ARGUMENT,Then let me live; how hard soe'er and sore

8806,ARGUMENT,"While, dearest boy, my late and only care,"

8812,ARGUMENT,LXXVIII. Forth troop the horsemen from the gates. First ride
8813,ARGUMENT,AEneas and Achates; in the rear
8814,ARGUMENT,"Troy's nobles, led by Pallas, in the pride"
8815,ARGUMENT,"Of broidered scarf and figured arms, appear."
8816,ARGUMENT,"As when bright Lucifer, to Venus dear"
8817,ARGUMENT,"Beyond all planets and each starry beam,"
8818,ARGUMENT,"High up in heaven his sacred head doth rear,"
8819,ARGUMENT,"Bathed in the freshness of the Ocean stream,"
8820,ARGUMENT,"And melts the dark, so fair the gallant youth doth seem."
8821,ARGUMENT,
8822,ARGUMENT,"LXXIX. The matrons stand upon the walls, distraught,"
8823,ARGUMENT,And mark the dust-cloud and the mail-clad train.
8824,ARGUMENT,"These through the brushwood, where the road lies short,"
8825,ARGUMENT,"Move on in arms. The war-shout peals again,"
8826,ARGUMENT,The hard hoofs clattering shake the crumbling plain.
8827,ARGUMENT,"And now, where, cold with crystal waves, is found"
8828,ARGUMENT,"Fair Caere's stream, a spreading grove they gain."
8829,ARGUMENT,"Ages have spread its sanctity, and, crowned"
8830,ARGUMENT,"With pine-woods dark as night, the hollow hills stand round."
8831,ARGUMENT,
8832,ARGUMENT,"LXXX. This grove, 'tis said, the tribes Pelasgian--they,"
8833,ARGUMENT,Who first in Latin marches dwelt of old--
8834,ARGUMENT,"Kept sacred to Silvanus, and the day"
8835,ARGUMENT,Vowed to the guardian of the field and fold.
8836,ARGUMENT,"Hard by, brave Tarchon and his Tuscans bold"
8837,ARGUMENT,"Lay camped. His legions, stretching o'er the meads,"
8838,ARGUMENT,The Trojans from a rising ground behold.
8839,ARGUMENT,AEneas here his toil-worn warriors leads;
8840,ARGUMENT,"Food for themselves they bring, and forage for their steeds."
8841,ARGUMENT,
8842,ARGUMENT,"LXXXI. Meanwhile fair Venus through the clouds came down,"
8843,ARGUMENT,"Bearing her gifts. Couched in a secret glade,"
8844,ARGUMENT,"By a cool river, she espies her son,"
8845,ARGUMENT,"And hails him: ""See the promised gifts displayed,"
8846,ARGUMENT,Wrought by my husband's cunning for thine aid.

8848,ARGUMENT,"Nor fear with Turnus to contend."" So said"

8850,ARGUMENT,And on an oak in front the radiant arms she placed.

8853,ARGUMENT,"He views the gifts, and marvels at the sight."
8854,ARGUMENT,"In turn he handles, and in turn surveys"
8855,ARGUMENT,"The helmet tall with fiery crest bedight,"
8856,ARGUMENT,"The fateful sword, the breastplate's brazen might,"
8857,ARGUMENT,"Blood-red, and huge, and glorious to behold"
8858,ARGUMENT,"As some dark cloud, far-blazing with the light"
8859,ARGUMENT,"Of sunset; then the polished greaves of gold,"
8860,ARGUMENT,"The spear, the mystic shield, too wondrous to be told."
8861,ARGUMENT,
8862,ARGUMENT,"LXXXIII. There did the Fire-king, who the future cons,"
8863,ARGUMENT,"The tale of ancient Italy portray,"
8864,ARGUMENT,"Rome's triumphs, and Ascanius' distant sons,"
8865,ARGUMENT,"Their wars in order, and each hard-fought fray."
8866,ARGUMENT,"There, in the cave of Mars all verdurous, lay"
8867,ARGUMENT,The fostering she-wolf with the twins; they hung
8868,ARGUMENT,"About her teats, and licked in careless play"
8869,ARGUMENT,"Their mother. She, with slim neck backward flung,"
8870,ARGUMENT,"In turn caressed them both, and shaped them with her tongue."
8871,ARGUMENT,
8872,ARGUMENT,"LXXXIV. There, later Rome, and there, the Sabine dames"
8873,ARGUMENT,"Amid the crowded theatre he viewed,"
8874,ARGUMENT,Raped by the Romans at the Circus games;
8875,ARGUMENT,"The sudden war, that from the deed ensued,"
8876,ARGUMENT,With aged Tatius and his Cures rude.
8877,ARGUMENT,"There stand the kings, still armed, but foes no more,"
8878,ARGUMENT,"Beside Jove's altar, and abjure the feud."

8883,ARGUMENT,"('Twere better, perjured Alban, to be true!)"
8884,ARGUMENT,Fierce Tullus dragged the traitor's limbs in scorn
8885,ARGUMENT,"Through brambles, dripping with the crimson dew."
8886,ARGUMENT,Porsenna there around the city drew
8887,ARGUMENT,His 'leaguering host. But freedom fired the blood

8890,ARGUMENT,"And Cloelia burst her bonds, and singly stemmed the flood."
8891,ARGUMENT,
8892,ARGUMENT,"LXXXVI. Next, Manlius guards the Capitol; see here"
8893,ARGUMENT,"The straw-thatched palace. Silvered in the gold,"
8894,ARGUMENT,The fluttering goose proclaims the Gauls are near.
8895,ARGUMENT,"They, screened by darkness, thread the woods, and hold"
8896,ARGUMENT,With arms the slumbering citadel. Behold
8897,ARGUMENT,"Their beards all golden, and their golden hair,"
8898,ARGUMENT,"Their white necks gleaming with the twisted gold,"
8899,ARGUMENT,Their chequered plaids. Each hand an Alpine spear
8900,ARGUMENT,"Waves, and an oblong shield their stalwart arms upbear."
8901,ARGUMENT,
8902,ARGUMENT,"LXXXVII. There danced the Salians, the Luperci reeled"
8903,ARGUMENT,"Half-naked. See them sculptured in array,"
8904,ARGUMENT,"With caps wool-tufted, and the sky-dropt shield."
8905,ARGUMENT,"Chaste dames, in cushioned chariots, lead the way"
8906,ARGUMENT,"Through the glad city. Elsewhere, far away,"
8907,ARGUMENT,"Loom Dis and Tartarus, where the guilty pine,"
8908,ARGUMENT,"And Catiline, upon a rock for aye"
8909,ARGUMENT,"Hangs, shuddering at the Furies. Distant shine"
8910,ARGUMENT,"The just, where Cato stands, dealing the law divine."
8911,ARGUMENT,
8912,ARGUMENT,"LXXXVIII. The swelling ocean in the midst is seen,"
8913,ARGUMENT,"All golden, but the billow's hoary spray"
8914,ARGUMENT,Foams o'er the blue. Dolphins of silvery sheen
8915,ARGUMENT,"Lash the white eddies with their tails in play,"
8916,ARGUMENT,Cleaving the surges. In the centre lay
8917,ARGUMENT,"The brazen fleets, all panoplied for war,"
8918,ARGUMENT,'Tis Actium's fight; Leucate's headland grey
8919,ARGUMENT,"Boils with the tumult of the distant jar,"
8920,ARGUMENT,"And golden glow the waves, effulgent from afar."

8922,ARGUMENT,"LXXXIX. Augustus his Italians leads from home,"
8923,ARGUMENT,"High on the stern. The Senators stand round,"
8924,ARGUMENT,"The people, and the guardian gods of Rome."
8925,ARGUMENT,With double flame his joyous brows are crowned;
8926,ARGUMENT,The constellation of his sire renowned
8927,ARGUMENT,"Beams o'er his head. There too, his ships in line,"
8928,ARGUMENT,"With winds and gods to prosper him, is found"
8929,ARGUMENT,Agrippa. Radiant on his head doth shine
8930,ARGUMENT,"The crown of golden beaks, the battle's glorious sign."
8931,ARGUMENT,
8932,ARGUMENT,"XC. Here, late from Parthia and the Red-sea coast,"
8933,ARGUMENT,"With motley legions and barbaric pride,"
8934,ARGUMENT,"Comes Anthony. From Egypt swarms his host,"
8935,ARGUMENT,From India and far Bactra. At his side
8936,ARGUMENT,Stands--shame to tell it--an Egyptian bride.
8937,ARGUMENT,See now the fight; prows churn and oar-blades lash
8938,ARGUMENT,"The foam. 'Twould seem the Cyclads swim the tide,"
8939,ARGUMENT,"Torn from his moorings, or the mountains clash,"
8940,ARGUMENT,"So huge the tower-crowned ships, so terrible the crash."
8941,ARGUMENT,
8942,ARGUMENT,"XCI. Winged darts are hurled, and flaming tow; the leas"
8943,ARGUMENT,"Of Neptune redden. There the queen stands by,"
8944,ARGUMENT,"And sounds the timbrel for the fray, nor sees"
8945,ARGUMENT,The asps behind. All monsters of the sky
8946,ARGUMENT,"With Neptune, Venus, and Minerva vie."
8947,ARGUMENT,In vain Anubis barks; Mars raves among
8948,ARGUMENT,The combatants; the Furies frown on high.
8949,ARGUMENT,"With mantle rent, glad Discord joins the throng;"
8950,ARGUMENT,"Behind, with bloody scourge, Bellona stalks along."
8951,ARGUMENT,
8952,ARGUMENT,"XCII. There Actian Phoebus, gazing on the scene,"
8953,ARGUMENT,"Bent his dread bow. Egypt, Arabia fled,"
8954,ARGUMENT,"And India turned in terror. There, the queen"
8955,ARGUMENT,"Calls to the winds; behold, the sails are spread."
8956,ARGUMENT,"Her, pale with thoughts of dying, through the dead"
8957,ARGUMENT,The waves and zephyrs--so the gold expressed--
8958,ARGUMENT,"Bear onward. Yonder, to his sheltering bed"
8959,ARGUMENT,"Nile, sorrowing, calls the fugitives to rest,"
8960,ARGUMENT,"Unfolds his winding robes, and bares his azure breast."
8961,ARGUMENT,
8962,ARGUMENT,"XCIII. There, Caesar sacred to his gods proclaims"
8963,ARGUMENT,"Three hundred temples, each a stately fane."
8964,ARGUMENT,Behold his triple triumph. Shouts and games
8965,ARGUMENT,Gladden the streets; glad matrons chant the strain
8966,ARGUMENT,"At every altar, and the steers are slain."
8967,ARGUMENT,"He takes the offerings, and reviews the throng,"
8968,ARGUMENT,Throned in the portal of Apollo's fane.
8969,ARGUMENT,"Below, the captive nations march along,"
8970,ARGUMENT,"Diverse in arms and garb, and each of different tongue."
8971,ARGUMENT,
8972,ARGUMENT,"XCIV. Wild Nomads, Africans uncinctured came,"
8973,ARGUMENT,"Carians, Gelonian bowmen, and behind"

8975,ARGUMENT,"The Morini, extreme of human-kind."
8976,ARGUMENT,"Last, proud Araxes, whom no bridge could bind,"
8977,ARGUMENT,"Euphrates humbled, and the horned Rhine."
8978,ARGUMENT,"All this, by Vulcan on the shield designed,"
8979,ARGUMENT,"He sees, and, gladdening at the gift divine,"
8980,ARGUMENT,Upbears aloft the fame and fortunes of his line.

8989,ARGUMENT,
8990,ARGUMENT,"Certified by Juno of the absence of AEneas, Turnus leads his forces"
8991,ARGUMENT,against the Trojans. When they entrench themselves within their
8992,ARGUMENT,"lines, he attempts to burn their ships, which are thereupon changed"
8993,ARGUMENT,"by Cybele into nymphs, and float away (1-144). Turnus undaunted"
8994,ARGUMENT,harangues his men and beleaguers the camp (145-198). Nisus and
8995,ARGUMENT,"Euryalus scheme, and petition, to sally forth to find AEneas and a"
8996,ARGUMENT,"rescue. Setting out with promise of rich rewards if successful, they"
8997,ARGUMENT,surprise the Latin Camp but are themselves in turn surprised and
8998,ARGUMENT,slain (199-513). Their victims are buried; their heads are paraded
8999,ARGUMENT,"on pikes before the Trojan Camp, to the agony of the mother of"
9000,ARGUMENT,Euryalus (514-576). The allies assault the camp. Virgil invokes
9001,ARGUMENT,Calliope to describe the fray (577-603). The collapse of a tower and
9002,ARGUMENT,losses on both sides prelude Ascanius' baptism of fire. He kills his
9003,ARGUMENT,man (604-765). The brothers Pandarus and Bitias open the camp-gates
9004,ARGUMENT,"in defiance. Bitias falls, and Pandarus, retreating, shuts Turnus"
9005,ARGUMENT,"within the camp, who kills him, but failing to let in his friends"
9006,ARGUMENT,is eventually hard pressed (766-882). The Trojans rally round
9007,ARGUMENT,Mnestheus and Serestus. Turnus plunges into the river and with
9008,ARGUMENT,difficulty escapes by swimming (883-927).
9009,ARGUMENT,
9010,ARGUMENT,
9011,ARGUMENT,"I.  While thus in distant quarter moves the scene,"
9012,ARGUMENT,Down to the daring Turnus from the skies
9013,ARGUMENT,"Comes Iris, sent by the Saturnian queen."
9014,ARGUMENT,"Him seated in a hallowed vale, where lies"
9015,ARGUMENT,"His father's grove, Pilumnus', she espies."
9016,ARGUMENT,There straight with rosy lips the daughter fair
9017,ARGUMENT,"Of Thaumas hails the hero: ""Turnus, rise."
9018,ARGUMENT,Behold what none of all the Gods would dare
9019,ARGUMENT,"To promise, rolling Time hath proffered without prayer."
9020,ARGUMENT,
9021,ARGUMENT,"II. ""Fleet left and friends, AEneas to the court"
9022,ARGUMENT,"Of Palatine Evander speeds his way,"
9023,ARGUMENT,"Nay, the far towns of Corythus hath sought,"
9024,ARGUMENT,And arms the Lydian swains to meet the fray!
9025,ARGUMENT,Now call for steel and chariot. Why delay?
9026,ARGUMENT,"Surprise the camp and capture it.""--She said,"
9027,ARGUMENT,"And straight on balanced pinions soared away,"
9028,ARGUMENT,"Cleaving the bow. The warrior marked, and spread"
9029,ARGUMENT,"His hands, and thus with prayer pursued her as she fled:"
9030,ARGUMENT,
9031,ARGUMENT,"III. ""O Iris, Heaven's fair glory, who hath sent"
9032,ARGUMENT,Thee hither? whence this sudden light so clear?
9033,ARGUMENT,"I see the firmament asunder rent,"
9034,ARGUMENT,And planets wandering in the polar sphere.
9035,ARGUMENT,"Blest omens, hail! I follow thee, whoe'er"
9036,ARGUMENT,"Thou art, that call'st to battle."" He arose"
9037,ARGUMENT,"With joy, and stepping to the streamlet near,"
9038,ARGUMENT,"Scoops up the water in his palms, and bows"
9039,ARGUMENT,"In suppliance to the Gods, and burdens Heaven with vows."
9040,ARGUMENT,
9041,ARGUMENT,"IV. Now all the host were marching on the meads,"
9042,ARGUMENT,"Well-horsed, and panoplied in golden gear,"
9043,ARGUMENT,With broidered raiment. Brave Messapus leads
9044,ARGUMENT,"The van, the sons of Tyrrheus close the rear,"
9045,ARGUMENT,And Turnus in mid column shakes his spear.
9046,ARGUMENT,"Slow moves the host, as when his seven-fold head"
9047,ARGUMENT,"Great Ganges lifts in silence, calm and clear,"
9048,ARGUMENT,"Or Nile, whose flood the fruitful soil hath fed,"
9049,ARGUMENT,"Ebbs from the fattened fields, and hides him in his bed."
9050,ARGUMENT,
9051,ARGUMENT,"V.  Far off, the Teucrians from their camp descried"
9052,ARGUMENT,The gathering dust-cloud on the plains appear.
9053,ARGUMENT,"Then brave Caicus from a bastion cried,"
9054,ARGUMENT,"""What dark mass, rolling towards us, have we here?"
9055,ARGUMENT,"Arm, townsmen, arm! Bring quick the sword and spear,"
9056,ARGUMENT,"And mount the battlements, and man the wall."
9057,ARGUMENT,"The foemen, ho!"" And with a mighty cheer"
9058,ARGUMENT,"The Teucrians, hurrying at the warning call,"
9059,ARGUMENT,"Pour in through all the gates, and muster on the wall."
9060,ARGUMENT,
9061,ARGUMENT,"VI. So, parting, wise AEneas gave command,"
9062,ARGUMENT,"Should chance surprise them, with their chief away,"
9063,ARGUMENT,"To shun the field, nor battle hand to hand,"
9064,ARGUMENT,"But safe behind their sheltering earthworks stay,"
9065,ARGUMENT,"And, guarding wall and rampart, stand at bay."
9066,ARGUMENT,"So now, though passion and indignant hate"
9067,ARGUMENT,"Prompt to engage, his mandate they obey,"
9068,ARGUMENT,"And bar each inlet, and secure each gate,"
9069,ARGUMENT,"And, armed, in sheltering towers their enemies await."
9070,ARGUMENT,
9071,ARGUMENT,"VII. Turnus, with twenty horsemen, left the rest"
9072,ARGUMENT,"To lag behind, and near the town-gate drew"
9073,ARGUMENT,"All unforeseen. A Thracian steed he pressed,"
9074,ARGUMENT,Dappled with white; a crest of scarlet hue
9075,ARGUMENT,High o'er his golden helmet flamed in view.
9076,ARGUMENT,"Loudly he shrills in anger to his train,"
9077,ARGUMENT,"""Who first with me will at the foemen--who?"
9078,ARGUMENT,"See there!"" and, rising hurls his spear amain,"
9079,ARGUMENT,"Sign of the fight begun, and pricks along the plain."
9080,ARGUMENT,
9081,ARGUMENT,"VIII. With shouts his comrades welcome the attack,"
9082,ARGUMENT,And clamouring fiercely follow in his train.
9083,ARGUMENT,"They marvel at the Teucrian hearts so slack,"
9084,ARGUMENT,"That none will dare to trust the open plain,"
9085,ARGUMENT,"And fight like men, but in the camp remain,"
9086,ARGUMENT,And safe behind their sheltering rampart stay.
9087,ARGUMENT,"Now here, now there, fierce Turnus in disdain"
9088,ARGUMENT,"Rides round the walls, and, searching for a way,"
9089,ARGUMENT,"Where way is none, still strives an entrance to essay."
9090,ARGUMENT,
9091,ARGUMENT,"IX. As wolf, in ambush by the fold, sore beat"
9092,ARGUMENT,"With winds, at midnight howls amid the rain."
9093,ARGUMENT,The lambs beneath their mothers safely bleat.
9094,ARGUMENT,"He, mad with rage, and faint with famine's pain,"
9095,ARGUMENT,"Thirsts for their blood, and ramps at them in vain;"
9096,ARGUMENT,"So raves fierce Turnus, as his eyes survey"
9097,ARGUMENT,"The walls and camp. Grief burns in every vein,"
9098,ARGUMENT,As round he looks for access and a way
9099,ARGUMENT,"To shake the Teucrians out, and strew them forth to slay."
9100,ARGUMENT,
9101,ARGUMENT,"X.  The fleet, as by the flanking camp it lies,"
9102,ARGUMENT,"Fenced by the river and the mounded sand,"
9103,ARGUMENT,"He marks, then loudly to the burning cries,"
9104,ARGUMENT,"And with a flaming pinestock fills his hand,"
9105,ARGUMENT,Himself aflame. His presence cheers the band.
9106,ARGUMENT,"All set to work, and strip the watchfires bare:"
9107,ARGUMENT,Each warrior arms him with a murky brand:
9108,ARGUMENT,"The smoking torch shoots up a pitchy glare,"
9109,ARGUMENT,And clouds of mingled soot the Fire-god flings in air.
9110,ARGUMENT,
9111,ARGUMENT,"XI. Say, Muse, what god from Teucrians turned the flame,"
9112,ARGUMENT,"Such fiery havoc. O, the tale declare;"
9113,ARGUMENT,"Old is its faith, but deathless is its fame."
9114,ARGUMENT,When first AEneas did his fleet prepare
9115,ARGUMENT,"'Neath Phrygian Ida, through the seas to fare,"
9116,ARGUMENT,To Jove the Berecynthian queen divine
9117,ARGUMENT,"Spake thus, 'tis said, urging a suppliant's prayer:"
9118,ARGUMENT,"""O Lord Olympian, hearken and incline."
9119,ARGUMENT,"Grant what thy mother asks, who made Olympus thine."

9121,ARGUMENT,"XII. ""A wood, beloved for many a year, was mine,"
9122,ARGUMENT,"A grove of sacrifice, on Ida's height,"
9123,ARGUMENT,Darksome with maple and the swart pitch-pine.
9124,ARGUMENT,"This wood, these trees, my ever-dear delight,"
9125,ARGUMENT,Gladly I gave to speed the Dardan's flight.
9126,ARGUMENT,But doubts and fears my troubled mind assail.
9127,ARGUMENT,"O calm them; may a parent's prayer have might,"
9128,ARGUMENT,And this their birth upon our hills avail
9129,ARGUMENT,"To guide their voyage safe, and shield them from the gale."""
9130,ARGUMENT,
9131,ARGUMENT,"XIII. Then spake her son, who wields the starry sphere,"
9132,ARGUMENT,"""Mother, what would'st thou of the Fates demand?"
9133,ARGUMENT,What art thou seeking for these Teucrians here?
9134,ARGUMENT,"Shall vessels, fashioned by a mortal hand,"
9135,ARGUMENT,The gift of immortality command?
9136,ARGUMENT,"And shall AEneas sail the uncertain main,"
9137,ARGUMENT,"Himself of safety certain, and his band?"
9138,ARGUMENT,Did ever God such privilege attain?
9139,ARGUMENT,"Nay, rather, when at length, Ausonian ports they gain,"
9140,ARGUMENT,
9141,ARGUMENT,"XIV. ""Their duty done, and Ocean's dangers o'er,"
9142,ARGUMENT,"What ships soe'er shall have escaped, to bear"
9143,ARGUMENT,"The Dardan chief to the Laurentian shore,"
9144,ARGUMENT,"Shall lose their perishable form, and wear"
9145,ARGUMENT,"The sea-nymphs' shape, like Galatea fair"
9146,ARGUMENT,"And Doto, when they breast the deep."" He spake,"
9147,ARGUMENT,"And by his brother's Stygian river sware,"
9148,ARGUMENT,"Whose pitchy torrent swells the infernal lake,"
9149,ARGUMENT,And with his awful nod made all Olympus shake.
9150,ARGUMENT,
9151,ARGUMENT,"XV. The day was come, the fated time complete,"
9152,ARGUMENT,When Turnus' insults bade the Mother rise
9153,ARGUMENT,And ward the firebrands from her sacred fleet.
9154,ARGUMENT,"A sudden light now flashed upon their eyes,"
9155,ARGUMENT,"A cloud from eastward ran athwart the skies,"
9156,ARGUMENT,"With choirs of Ida, and a voice through air"
9157,ARGUMENT,"Pealed forth, and filled both armies with surprise,"
9158,ARGUMENT,"""Trojans, be calm; your needless pains forbear,"
9159,ARGUMENT,Nor arm to save these ships; their safety is my care.

9161,ARGUMENT,"XVI. ""Sooner shall Turnus make the ocean blaze,"
9162,ARGUMENT,"Than these my pines. Go, sea-nymphs, and be free,"
9163,ARGUMENT,"Your mother bids you."" Each at once obeys,"
9164,ARGUMENT,"Their cables snapt, like dolphins in their glee,"
9165,ARGUMENT,"They dip their beaks, and dive beneath the sea."
9166,ARGUMENT,"Hence, where before along the shore had stood"
9167,ARGUMENT,The brazen poops--O marvellous to see!--
9168,ARGUMENT,"So many now, with maiden forms endued,"
9169,ARGUMENT,"Rise up, and reappear, and float upon the flood."
9170,ARGUMENT,
9171,ARGUMENT,XVII. All stand aghast; amid the startled steeds
9172,ARGUMENT,"Messapus quails, and Tiber checks his tide,"
9173,ARGUMENT,"And, hoarsely murmuring, from the deep recedes."
9174,ARGUMENT,"Yet fails not Turnus, prompt to cheer or chide."
9175,ARGUMENT,"""To Teucrians point these prodigies,"" he cried,"
9176,ARGUMENT,"""They bide not, they, Rutulian sword and brand."
9177,ARGUMENT,E'en Jove their wonted succour hath denied.
9178,ARGUMENT,"Barred is the sea, and half the world is banned;"

9184,ARGUMENT,"My Fates, these robbers of my bride to slay."
9185,ARGUMENT,"Not Atreus' sons alone, and only they,"
9186,ARGUMENT,"Have known a sorrow and a smart so keen,"
9187,ARGUMENT,"And armed for vengeance. But enough, ye say,"
9188,ARGUMENT,Once to have fallen? One trespass then had been
9189,ARGUMENT,"Enough, and made them loathe all womankind, I ween."
9190,ARGUMENT,
9191,ARGUMENT,"XIX. ""Lo, these who think a paltry wall can save,"
9192,ARGUMENT,"A narrow ditch can thwart us,--these, so bold,"
9193,ARGUMENT,With but a span betwixt them and the grave!

9195,ARGUMENT,"Sink down in ruin, as the flames uprolled?"
9196,ARGUMENT,"But ye, my chosen, who with me will scale"
9197,ARGUMENT,"Yon wall, and storm their trembling camp? Behold,"
9198,ARGUMENT,"No aid divine nor ships of thousand sail,"
9199,ARGUMENT,"Nor Vulcan's arms I need, o'er Trojans to prevail."
9200,ARGUMENT,
9201,ARGUMENT,"XX. ""Nay; let Etrurians join them, one and all,"

9211,ARGUMENT,"XXI. His outposts plants Messapus, set to guard"

9213,ARGUMENT,"Twice seven captains round the camp keep ward,"
9214,ARGUMENT,"Each with a hundred warriors of the best,"
9215,ARGUMENT,With golden armour and a blood-red crest.
9216,ARGUMENT,"These to and fro pace sentinels, and share"
9217,ARGUMENT,"The watch in turn; those, on the sward at rest,"
9218,ARGUMENT,"Tilt the brass wine-bowl. Bright the watch-fires flare,"
9219,ARGUMENT,And games and festive mirth the wakeful night outwear.
9220,ARGUMENT,
9221,ARGUMENT,"XXII. Forth look the Trojans from their walls, and line"
9222,ARGUMENT,"The heights in arms, and test with hurrying fear"
9223,ARGUMENT,"The gates, and bridges to the bulwarks join,"
9224,ARGUMENT,"And bring up darts and javelins. Mnestheus here,"
9225,ARGUMENT,"There bold Serestus is at hand to cheer,"

9228,ARGUMENT,"Thus all in turn, where peril pressed the most,"
9229,ARGUMENT,"Keep watch along the wall, dividing danger's post."

9234,ARGUMENT,Quick with light arrows and the flying spear.
9235,ARGUMENT,"Beside him stood Euryalus, his fere;"
9236,ARGUMENT,"Scarce on his cheeks the down of manhood grew,"
9237,ARGUMENT,The comeliest youth that donned the Trojan gear.
9238,ARGUMENT,"Love made them one; as one, to fight they flew,"
9239,ARGUMENT,"As one they guard the gates, companions tried and true."
9240,ARGUMENT,
9241,ARGUMENT,"XXIV. Then Nisus: ""Is it that the Gods inspire,"
9242,ARGUMENT,"Euryalus, this fever of the breast?"
9243,ARGUMENT,Or make we gods of but a wild desire?
9244,ARGUMENT,"Battle I seek, or some adventurous quest,"
9245,ARGUMENT,"And scorn to dally with inglorious rest,"
9246,ARGUMENT,"See yonder the Rutulians, stretched supine,"
9247,ARGUMENT,"What careless confidence is theirs, oppressed"
9248,ARGUMENT,"With wine and slumber; how the watch-fires shine,"
9249,ARGUMENT,"Faint, few, and far between; what silence holds the line."

9259,ARGUMENT,Thus to his ardent friend Euryalus replies:

9414,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he checks his voice, and, aiming steep,"
9415,ARGUMENT,Drives at proud Rhamnes. On a piled-up heap
9416,ARGUMENT,"Of carpets lay the warrior, and his breast"

9418,ARGUMENT,"Augur and king, whom Turnus loved the best."
9419,ARGUMENT,Not all his augur's craft could now his doom arrest.
9420,ARGUMENT,
9421,ARGUMENT,"XLII. Three slaves beside him, lying heedless here"
9422,ARGUMENT,"Amidst their arms, he numbers with the slain,"
9423,ARGUMENT,"Then Remus' page, and Remus' charioteer,"

9430,ARGUMENT,
9431,ARGUMENT,"XLIII. Lamus and Lamyras he slew outright,"
9432,ARGUMENT,"And fair Serranus, as asleep he lay,"

9437,ARGUMENT,"Springs, mad with hunger, and the feeble prey,"
9438,ARGUMENT,"All mute with terror, in his clutch doth hold,"
9439,ARGUMENT,"And rends with bloody mouth, and riots uncontrolled,"
9440,ARGUMENT,
9441,ARGUMENT,"XLIV. Such havoc wrought Euryalus, so flamed"
9442,ARGUMENT,"His fury. Fadus and Herbesus died,"
9443,ARGUMENT,"And Abaris, and many a wight unnamed,"
9444,ARGUMENT,"Caught unaware. But Rhoetus woke, and tried"
9445,ARGUMENT,In fear behind a massive bowl to hide.
9446,ARGUMENT,"Full in the breast, or e'er the wretch upstood,"
9447,ARGUMENT,"The shining sword-blade to the hilt he plied,"
9448,ARGUMENT,Then drew it back death-laden. Wine and blood
9449,ARGUMENT,"Gush out, the dying lips disgorge the crimson flood."
9450,ARGUMENT,
9451,ARGUMENT,"XLV. Thence, burning, to Messapus' camp he speeds,"
9452,ARGUMENT,"Where faint the watch-fires flicker far away,"
9453,ARGUMENT,"And tethered on the herbage graze the steeds,"
9454,ARGUMENT,"When briefly thus speaks Nisus, fain to stay"
9455,ARGUMENT,The lust of battle and mad thirst to slay:
9456,ARGUMENT,"""Cease we; the light, our enemy, is near."
9457,ARGUMENT,"Vengeance is glutted; we have hewn our way."""
9458,ARGUMENT,"Bowls, solid silver armour here and there"
9459,ARGUMENT,"They leave behind untouched, and arras rich and rare."
9460,ARGUMENT,
9461,ARGUMENT,"XLVI. The arms and belt of Rhamnes, bossed with gold,"
9462,ARGUMENT,"Which Caedicus, his friendship to attest,"
9463,ARGUMENT,"Sent to Tiburtine Remulus of old,"
9464,ARGUMENT,"Whose grandson took it, as a last bequest"
9465,ARGUMENT,(Rutulians thence these spoils of war possessed)--
9466,ARGUMENT,"These trophies seized Euryalus, and braced"
9467,ARGUMENT,"The useless trappings on his valorous breast,"
9468,ARGUMENT,"And on his head Messapus' helm he placed,"
9469,ARGUMENT,Light and with graceful plumes; and from the camp they haste.
9470,ARGUMENT,
9471,ARGUMENT,XLVII. Meanwhile from out Laurentum rides a train
9472,ARGUMENT,"With news of Turnus, while the main array"
9473,ARGUMENT,"With marshalled ranks is lingering on the plain,"
9474,ARGUMENT,Three hundred shieldsmen Volscens' lead obey.
9475,ARGUMENT,"Now to the ramparts they have found their way,"
9476,ARGUMENT,"When lo, to leftward, hurrying from their raid,"
9477,ARGUMENT,They mark the youths amid the twilight grey.
9478,ARGUMENT,"His glittering helm Euryalus betrayed,"
9479,ARGUMENT,"That flashed the moonbeams back, and pierced the glimmering shade."
9480,ARGUMENT,
9481,ARGUMENT,XLVIII. Nor passed the sight unheeded. Shrill and loud
9482,ARGUMENT,"""Stand, who are ye in armour dight, and why?"
9483,ARGUMENT,"What make ye there?"" cries Volscens from the crowd,"
9484,ARGUMENT,"""And whither wend ye?"" Naught the youths reply,"
9485,ARGUMENT,"But swiftly to the bordering forest fly,"
9486,ARGUMENT,And trust to darkness. Then around each way
9487,ARGUMENT,"The horsemen ride, all outlet to deny;"
9488,ARGUMENT,"Circling, like huntsmen, closely as they may,"
9489,ARGUMENT,"They watch the well-known turns, and wait the expected prey."
9490,ARGUMENT,
9491,ARGUMENT,"XLIX. Shagg'd with rough brakes and sable ilex, spread"
9492,ARGUMENT,"The wood, and, glimmering in the twilight grey,"
9493,ARGUMENT,Through broken tracks a narrow pathway led.
9494,ARGUMENT,"The shadowy boughs, the cumbrous spoils delay"
9495,ARGUMENT,"Euryalus, and fear mistakes the way."
9496,ARGUMENT,"Nisus, unheeding, through the foemen flies,"
9497,ARGUMENT,"And gains the place,--called Alba now--where lay"
9498,ARGUMENT,Latinus' pastures; then with back-turned eyes
9499,ARGUMENT,"Stands still, and seeks in vain his absent friend, and cries:"

9505,ARGUMENT,"Picking his footsteps with observant view,"
9506,ARGUMENT,"And roamed the silent brushwood. Steeds he hears,"
9507,ARGUMENT,"The noise, the signs of foemen who pursue."
9508,ARGUMENT,"A moment more, and, bursting on his ears,"
9509,ARGUMENT,"There came a shout, and lo, Euryalus appears."
9510,ARGUMENT,
9511,ARGUMENT,"LI. Him, in false ways, amid the darkness, ta'en,"
9512,ARGUMENT,The gathering band with sudden rush o'erbear.
9513,ARGUMENT,"Poor Nisus sees him struggling, but in vain."
9514,ARGUMENT,What should he do? By force of arms how dare
9515,ARGUMENT,"His friend to rescue? Shall he face them there,"
9516,ARGUMENT,"And rush upon the foemen's swords, to die,"
9517,ARGUMENT,And welcome wounds that win a death so fair?
9518,ARGUMENT,"His spear he poises, and with upturned eye"
9519,ARGUMENT,"And stalwart arm drawn back, invokes the Moon on high:"
9520,ARGUMENT,
9521,ARGUMENT,"LII. ""Come thou, Latonia, succour my distress!"

9529,ARGUMENT,"And, winged with strength, the steel went whistling through the shade."
9530,ARGUMENT,
9531,ARGUMENT,LIII. It struck the shield of Sulmo at his side;
9532,ARGUMENT,There broke the shaft and splintered. Down he rolled
9533,ARGUMENT,"Pierced through the midriff, and his life's warm tide"
9534,ARGUMENT,"Poured from his bosom, and the long sobs told"
9535,ARGUMENT,"Its heavings, ere the stiffening limbs grew cold."
9536,ARGUMENT,"All look around and tremble, when again"
9537,ARGUMENT,"The youth another javelin, waxing bold,"
9538,ARGUMENT,Aimed from his ear-tip. Through the temples twain
9539,ARGUMENT,"Of Tagus whizzed the steel, and warmed within the brain."
9540,ARGUMENT,
9541,ARGUMENT,"LIV. Fierce Volscens raves with anger, nor espies"

9544,ARGUMENT,"""Thy blood meanwhile the penalty shall pay"

9546,ARGUMENT,"Springs at Euryalus. Then, wild with fear,"
9547,ARGUMENT,"Poor Nisus shouts, in frenzy of dismay,"
9548,ARGUMENT,"Nor longer in the dark can hide, nor bear"
9549,ARGUMENT,"A pang of grief so keen--to lose a friend so dear,"
9550,ARGUMENT,
9551,ARGUMENT,"LV. ""Me--me, behold the doer! mine the deed!"
9552,ARGUMENT,"Kill me, Rutulians. By this hand they fell."
9553,ARGUMENT,"He could not--durst not. By the skies I plead,"
9554,ARGUMENT,"By yon bright stars, that witnessed what befell,"
9555,ARGUMENT,"He only loved his hapless friend too well."""
9556,ARGUMENT,"Vain was his prayer; the weapon, urged amain,"
9557,ARGUMENT,Pierced through his ribs and snowy breast. Out swell
9558,ARGUMENT,Dark streams of gore his lovely limbs to stain;
9559,ARGUMENT,The sinking neck weighs o'er the shoulders of the slain.
9560,ARGUMENT,
9561,ARGUMENT,"LVI. So doth the purple floweret, dying, droop,"
9562,ARGUMENT,Smit by the ploughshare. So the poppy frail
9563,ARGUMENT,"On stricken stalk its languid head doth stoop,"
9564,ARGUMENT,And bows o'erladen with the drenching hail.
9565,ARGUMENT,"But onward now, through thickest ranks of mail,"
9566,ARGUMENT,Rushed Nisus. Volscens only will he slay;
9567,ARGUMENT,He waits for none but Volscens. They assail
9568,ARGUMENT,"From right and left, and crowd his steps to stay."
9569,ARGUMENT,"He whirls his lightning brand, and presses to his prey."
9570,ARGUMENT,
9571,ARGUMENT,"LVII. Ere long he meets him clamouring, and down"
9572,ARGUMENT,"His throat he drives the griding sword amain,"
9573,ARGUMENT,"And takes his life, ere laying down his own."
9574,ARGUMENT,"Then, pierced he sinks upon his comrade slain,"
9575,ARGUMENT,And death's long slumber puts an end to pain.
9576,ARGUMENT,"O happy pair! if aught my verse ensure,"
9577,ARGUMENT,"No length of time shall make your memory wane,"
9578,ARGUMENT,"While, throned upon the Capitol secure,"
9579,ARGUMENT,"The AEneian house shall reign, and Roman rule endure."
9580,ARGUMENT,
9581,ARGUMENT,"LVIII. Weeping, the victors took the spoils and prey,"
9582,ARGUMENT,And back dead Volscens to their camp they bore.
9583,ARGUMENT,"Nor less the wailing in the camp that day,"
9584,ARGUMENT,"Brave Rhamnes found, and many a captive more,"
9585,ARGUMENT,"Numa, Serranus, weltering in their gore."
9586,ARGUMENT,"Thick round the dead and dying, where the plain"
9587,ARGUMENT,"Reeks freshly with the frothing blood, they pour."
9588,ARGUMENT,"Sadly they know Messapus' spoils again,"
9589,ARGUMENT,"The trappings saved with sweat, the helmet of the slain."
9590,ARGUMENT,
9591,ARGUMENT,"LIX. Now, rising from Tithonus' saffron couch,"
9592,ARGUMENT,The Goddess of the dawn with orient ray
9593,ARGUMENT,"Sprinkled the earth, and 'neath the wakening touch"
9594,ARGUMENT,"Of sunlight, all things stand revealed to-day."
9595,ARGUMENT,"Turnus himself, accoutred for the fray,"
9596,ARGUMENT,Wakes up his warriors with the morning light.
9597,ARGUMENT,At once each captain marshals in array
9598,ARGUMENT,"His company, in brazen arms bedight,"
9599,ARGUMENT,"And rumours whet their rage, and prick them to the fight."
9600,ARGUMENT,
9601,ARGUMENT,"LX. Nay more, aloft upon the javelin's end,"
9602,ARGUMENT,With shouts they bear--a miserable sight!--
9603,ARGUMENT,"The heads, the heads of Nisus and his friend."
9604,ARGUMENT,On the walls' left--the river flanked their right--
9605,ARGUMENT,"The sturdy Trojans stand arrayed for fight,"
9606,ARGUMENT,"And line the trenches and each lofty tower,"
9607,ARGUMENT,"Sad, while the foemen, clamorous with delight,"
9608,ARGUMENT,"March onward, with the heroes' heads before,"
9609,ARGUMENT,Well known--alas! too well--and dropping loathly gore.
9610,ARGUMENT,
9611,ARGUMENT,"LXI. Now Fame, winged herald, through the wildered town"
9612,ARGUMENT,Swift to Euryalus' mother speeds her way.
9613,ARGUMENT,Life's heat forsakes her; from her hand drops down
9614,ARGUMENT,"The shuttle, and the task-work rolls away."
9615,ARGUMENT,"Forth with a shriek, like women in dismay,"
9616,ARGUMENT,"Rending her hair, in frantic haste she flies,"
9617,ARGUMENT,"And seeks the ramparts and the war's array,"
9618,ARGUMENT,"Heedless of darts and dangers and surprise,"
9619,ARGUMENT,"Heedless of armed men, and fills the heaven with cries."
9620,ARGUMENT,
9621,ARGUMENT,"LXII. ""Thou--is it thou, Euryalus, my own?"
9622,ARGUMENT,"Thou, the late solace of my age? Ah, why"
9623,ARGUMENT,"So cruel? Could'st thou leave me here alone,"
9624,ARGUMENT,Nor let thy mother bid a last good-bye?
9625,ARGUMENT,Now left a prey on Latin soil to lie
9626,ARGUMENT,"Of dogs and birds, nor I, thy mother, there"
9627,ARGUMENT,"To wash thy wounds, and close thy lightless eye,"
9628,ARGUMENT,"And shroud thee in the robe I wrought so fair,"
9629,ARGUMENT,Fain with the busy loom to soothe an old wife's care!
9630,ARGUMENT,
9631,ARGUMENT,"LXIII. ""Where shall I follow thee? Thy corpse defiled,"
9632,ARGUMENT,Thy mangled limbs--where are they? Woe is me!
9633,ARGUMENT,Is this then all of what was once my child?
9634,ARGUMENT,Was it for this I roamed the land and sea?
9635,ARGUMENT,"Pierce _me_, Rutulians; hurl your darts at me,"
9636,ARGUMENT,"Me first, if ye a mother's love can know."
9637,ARGUMENT,"Great Sire of Heaven, have pity! set me free."
9638,ARGUMENT,Hurl with thy bolt to Tartarus below
9639,ARGUMENT,"This hateful head, that longs to quit a world of woe!"""
9640,ARGUMENT,
9641,ARGUMENT,"LXIV. So wails the mother, weeping and undone,"
9642,ARGUMENT,"And sorrow smites each warrior, as he hears,"
9643,ARGUMENT,"Each groaning, as a father for his son."
9644,ARGUMENT,"Grief runs, like wildfire, through the Trojan peers,"
9645,ARGUMENT,"And numbs their courage, and augments their fears."
9646,ARGUMENT,"Then, fain the spreading sorrow to allay,"
9647,ARGUMENT,"Ilioneus and Iulus, bathed in tears"
9648,ARGUMENT,Call Actor and Idaeus; gently they
9649,ARGUMENT,"The aged dame lift up, and to her home convey."
9650,ARGUMENT,
9651,ARGUMENT,LXV. Now terribly the brazen trumpet pealed
9652,ARGUMENT,"Its summons, and the war-shout rent the air."
9653,ARGUMENT,"On press the Volscians, locking shield to shield,"
9654,ARGUMENT,"And fill the trenches, and the breastwork tear."
9655,ARGUMENT,"These plant their ladders for assault, where'er"
9656,ARGUMENT,"A gap, just glimmering, shows the line less dense."
9657,ARGUMENT,Vain hope! the Teucrians with their darts are there.
9658,ARGUMENT,"Stout poles they ply, and thrust them from the fence,"
9659,ARGUMENT,"Trained by a lingering siege, and tutored to defence."
9660,ARGUMENT,
9661,ARGUMENT,"LXVI. Stones, too, they roll, to crush the serried shields:"
9662,ARGUMENT,"Blithely the warriors bear the storm below,"
9663,ARGUMENT,"Yet not for long; for, see, the penthouse yields."
9664,ARGUMENT,"Down on the midst, where thickest press the foe,"
9665,ARGUMENT,"The Teucrians, rolling, with a crash let go"
9666,ARGUMENT,"A ponderous mass, that opens to the light"
9667,ARGUMENT,"The jointed shields, and lays the warriors low."
9668,ARGUMENT,"Nor care they longer in the dark to fight,"
9669,ARGUMENT,But vie with distant darts to sweep the rampart's height.
9670,ARGUMENT,
9671,ARGUMENT,"LXVII. Pine-stock in hand, Mezentius hurls the flame;"
9672,ARGUMENT,"There, fierce Messapus rends the palisade,--"
9673,ARGUMENT,"Tamer of steeds, from Neptune's loins he came,--"
9674,ARGUMENT,And shouts aloud for ladders to invade.
9675,ARGUMENT,"Aid me, Calliope; ye Muses, aid"
9676,ARGUMENT,"To sing of Turnus and his deeds that day,"
9677,ARGUMENT,"The deaths he wrought, the havoc that he made,"
9678,ARGUMENT,And whom each warrior singled for his prey;
9679,ARGUMENT,"Roll back the war's great scroll, the mighty leaves display."
9680,ARGUMENT,
9681,ARGUMENT,"LXVIII. Built high, with lofty gangways, stood a tower,"
9682,ARGUMENT,"Fit post of vantage, which the Latins vied,"
9683,ARGUMENT,"With utmost effort and with all their power,"
9684,ARGUMENT,"To capture and destroy, while armed inside"
9685,ARGUMENT,"With stones, the Trojans through the loopholes plied"
9686,ARGUMENT,"Their missiles. Turnus, 'mid the foremost, cast"
9687,ARGUMENT,"A blazing brand, and, fastening to the side,"
9688,ARGUMENT,"Up went the flame; from floor to floor it passed,"
9689,ARGUMENT,"Clung to and licked the posts, and maddened with the blast."
9690,ARGUMENT,
9691,ARGUMENT,"LXIX. Within 'twas hurrying and tumultuous fright,"
9692,ARGUMENT,"As, crowding backward, they retreat before"
9693,ARGUMENT,"The advancing flames, and vainly long for flight."
9694,ARGUMENT,"Lo! toppling suddenly, the tower went o'er,"
9695,ARGUMENT,And shook the wide air with reverberant roar.
9696,ARGUMENT,"Half-dead, the huge mass following amain,"
9697,ARGUMENT,"They come to earth, stabbed by the darts they bore,"
9698,ARGUMENT,Or pierced by splinters through the breast. Scarce twain
9699,ARGUMENT,"Escape--Helenor one, and Lycus--from the slain."
9700,ARGUMENT,
9701,ARGUMENT,"LXX. Of these Helenor,--whom to Lydia's lord"
9702,ARGUMENT,"By stealth his slave, the fair Licymnia, bore,"
9703,ARGUMENT,"And sent to Ilium, where a simple sword"
9704,ARGUMENT,"And plain, white shield, yet unrenowned, he wore,--"
9705,ARGUMENT,"He, when he sees, around him and before,"
9706,ARGUMENT,"The Latin hosts, as when in fierce disdain,"
9707,ARGUMENT,"Hemmed round by huntsmen, in his rage the boar"
9708,ARGUMENT,"O'erleaps the spears, so, where the thickest rain"
9709,ARGUMENT,"The foemen's darts, springs forth Helenor to be slain."
9710,ARGUMENT,
9711,ARGUMENT,"LXXI. But fleeter far, young Lycus hastes to slip"
9712,ARGUMENT,"Through swords, through foes, and gains the walls, and tries"
9713,ARGUMENT,"To climb them, and a comrade's hand to grip."
9714,ARGUMENT,"With foot and spear behind him, as he flies,"
9715,ARGUMENT,"Comes Turnus. Scornfully the victor cries,"
9716,ARGUMENT,"""Mad fool! to fly, whom I have doomed to fall;"
9717,ARGUMENT,"Think'st thou to baffle Turnus of his prize?"""
9718,ARGUMENT,"Therewith he grasps him hanging, and withal"
9719,ARGUMENT,Down with his victim drags huge fragments of the wall.
9720,ARGUMENT,
9721,ARGUMENT,"LXXII. E'en so some snowy swan, or timorous hare"
9722,ARGUMENT,"Jove's armour-bearer, swooping from the sky,"
9723,ARGUMENT,"Grips in his talons, and aloft doth bear."
9724,ARGUMENT,"So, where apart the folded weanlings lie,"
9725,ARGUMENT,"Swift at some lamb the warrior-wolf doth fly,"
9726,ARGUMENT,"And leaves the mother, bleating in her woe."
9727,ARGUMENT,Loud rings the noise of battle. With a cry
9728,ARGUMENT,"The foe press on; these fill the trench below,"
9729,ARGUMENT,These to the topmost towers the blazing firebrands throw.
9730,ARGUMENT,
9731,ARGUMENT,LXXIII. Ilioneus with a rock's huge fragment quelled
9732,ARGUMENT,"Lucetius, creeping to the gate below"
9733,ARGUMENT,"With fire. Asylas Corynaeus felled,"
9734,ARGUMENT,"Liger Emathion, one skilled to throw"
9735,ARGUMENT,"The flying dart, one famous with the bow."
9736,ARGUMENT,"Caenus--brief triumph!--made Ortygius fall,"
9737,ARGUMENT,"With Dioxippus, Turnus lays him low,"
9738,ARGUMENT,"Then Itys, Clonius, Promolus withal,"
9739,ARGUMENT,"Sagaris, and Idas last, the warder of the wall."
9740,ARGUMENT,
9741,ARGUMENT,"LXXIV. There, slain by Capys, poor Privernus lay,"
9742,ARGUMENT,Grazed by Themilla's javelin; with a start
9743,ARGUMENT,"The madman flung his trusty shield away,"
9744,ARGUMENT,"And clapped his left hand to the wounded part,"
9745,ARGUMENT,"Fain, as he thought, to ease him of the smart."
9746,ARGUMENT,"Thereat, a light-winged arrow, unespied,"
9747,ARGUMENT,"Whirred on the wind. It missed the warrior's heart,"
9748,ARGUMENT,"But pierced his hand, and pinned it to his side,"
9749,ARGUMENT,"And, entering, clave the lung, and with a gasp he died."
9750,ARGUMENT,
9751,ARGUMENT,"LXXV. With broidered scarf of Spanish crimson, stood"
9752,ARGUMENT,"A comely youth, young Arcens was his name,"
9753,ARGUMENT,"Sent by his father, from Symaethus' flood,"
9754,ARGUMENT,"And nurtured in his mother's grove, he came,"
9755,ARGUMENT,"Where, rich and kind, Palicus' altars flame."
9756,ARGUMENT,"His lance laid by, thrice whirling round his head"
9757,ARGUMENT,"The whistling thong, Mezentius took his aim."
9758,ARGUMENT,"Clean through his temples hissed the molten lead,"
9759,ARGUMENT,"And prostrate in the dust, the gallant youth lay dead."
9760,ARGUMENT,
9761,ARGUMENT,"LXXVI. Then first, 'tis said, in war Ascanius drew"
9762,ARGUMENT,"His bow, wherewith in boyish days he plied"
9763,ARGUMENT,"The flying game. His hand Numanus slew,"
9764,ARGUMENT,"Called Remulus, to Turnus late allied,"
9765,ARGUMENT,For Turnus' youngest sister was his bride.
9766,ARGUMENT,"He, puffed with new-won royalty and proud,"
9767,ARGUMENT,"Stalked in the forefront of the fight, and cried"
9768,ARGUMENT,"With random clamour and big words and loud,"
9769,ARGUMENT,Fain by his noise to show his grandeur to the crowd.
9770,ARGUMENT,
9771,ARGUMENT,"LXXVII. ""Think ye no shame, poor cowards, thus again"
9772,ARGUMENT,"Behind your sheltering battlements to stand,"
9773,ARGUMENT,Twice-captured Phrygians! and to plant in vain
9774,ARGUMENT,"These walls, to shield you from the foemen's hand?"
9775,ARGUMENT,"Lo, these the varlets who our wives demand!"
9776,ARGUMENT,"What God, what madness blinded you, that e'er"
9777,ARGUMENT,Ye thought to venture to Italia's land?
9778,ARGUMENT,No wily-worded Ithacan is near;
9779,ARGUMENT,Far other foes than he or Atreus' sons are here.
9780,ARGUMENT,
9781,ARGUMENT,"LXXVIII. ""Our babes are hardened in the frost and flood,"
9782,ARGUMENT,Strong is the stock and sturdy whence we came.
9783,ARGUMENT,"Our boys from morn till evening scour the wood,"
9784,ARGUMENT,"Their joy is hunting, and the steed to tame,"
9785,ARGUMENT,"To bend the bow, the flying shaft to aim."
9786,ARGUMENT,"Patient of toil, and used to scanty cheer,"
9787,ARGUMENT,"Our youths with rakes the stubborn glebe reclaim,"
9788,ARGUMENT,Or storm the town. Through life we grasp the spear.

9791,ARGUMENT,"LXXIX. ""Age cannot stale, nor creeping years impair"
9792,ARGUMENT,"Stout hearts as ours, nor make our strength decay."
9793,ARGUMENT,Our hoary heads the heavy helmet bear.
9794,ARGUMENT,"Our joy is in the foray, day by day"
9795,ARGUMENT,"To reap fresh plunder, and to live by prey."
9796,ARGUMENT,"Ye love to dance, and dally with the fair,"
9797,ARGUMENT,In saffron robes with purple flounces gay.
9798,ARGUMENT,"Your toil is ease, and indolence your care,"
9799,ARGUMENT,"And tunics hung with sleeves, and ribboned coifs ye wear."

9801,ARGUMENT,"LXXX. ""Go Phrygian women, for ye are not men!"
9802,ARGUMENT,"Hence, to your Dindymus, and roam her heights"

9805,ARGUMENT,"With twy-mouthed music to her lewd delights,"
9806,ARGUMENT,Where boxen pipe and timbrel from afar
9807,ARGUMENT,Shriek forth the summons to her sacred rites.

9809,ARGUMENT,"Leave arms to men, like us, nor meddle with the war."""
9810,ARGUMENT,
9811,ARGUMENT,"LXXXI. Such taunts Ascanius brooked not. Stung with pride,"
9812,ARGUMENT,"A shaft he fitted to the horse-hair twine,"
9813,ARGUMENT,"And, turning, stood with outstretched arms, and cried:"
9814,ARGUMENT,"""Bless, Jove omnipotent, this bold design:"
9815,ARGUMENT,"Aid me, and yearly offerings shall be thine."
9816,ARGUMENT,A milk-white steer--I bind me to the vow--
9817,ARGUMENT,"Myself will lead, the choicest, to thy shrine,"
9818,ARGUMENT,"Tall as his mother, and with gilded brow,"
9819,ARGUMENT,"And butting horns, and hoofs, that spurn the sand e'en now."""
9820,ARGUMENT,
9821,ARGUMENT,"LXXXII. Jove heard, and leftward, where the sky was blue,"
9822,ARGUMENT,Thundered aloud. At once the fateful bow
9823,ARGUMENT,"Twanged; with a whirr the fateful arrow flew,"
9824,ARGUMENT,"And pierced the head of Remulus. ""Now go,"
9825,ARGUMENT,"And teach thy proud tongue to insult a foe,"
9826,ARGUMENT,And scoff at Trojan valour. _This_ reply
9827,ARGUMENT,"Twice-captured Phrygians to thy taunts bestow."""
9828,ARGUMENT,"Ascanius spoke; the Teucrians with a cry,"
9829,ARGUMENT,"Press on, their joyous hearts uplifting to the sky."
9830,ARGUMENT,
9831,ARGUMENT,"LXXXIII. Meanwhile, Apollo from his cloudy car"
9832,ARGUMENT,"The Ausonian host, and leaguered town descries,"
9833,ARGUMENT,And calls the youthful conqueror from afar:
9834,ARGUMENT,"""Hail to thy maiden prowess; yonder lies"
9835,ARGUMENT,"Thy path, brave boy, to glory and the skies."
9836,ARGUMENT,"O sons of Gods, and sire of Gods to be,"

9839,ARGUMENT,"Shall narrow Troy contain; so stands the Fate's decree."""
9840,ARGUMENT,
9841,ARGUMENT,"LXXXIV. He spake, and through the breathing air shot down,"
9842,ARGUMENT,"And sought Ascanius, now a god no more,"
9843,ARGUMENT,"But shaped like aged Butes, whilom known"
9844,ARGUMENT,"The servant of the Dardan king, who bore"
9845,ARGUMENT,"Anchises' shield, and waited at his door,"
9846,ARGUMENT,Then left to guard Ascanius. Such in view
9847,ARGUMENT,Apollo seemed; such clanging arms he wore;
9848,ARGUMENT,"Such were his hoary tresses, voice, and hue,"
9849,ARGUMENT,"And these his words, as near the fiery youth he drew:"

9855,ARGUMENT,"His arms divine the Dardan chieftains knew,"
9856,ARGUMENT,And heard the quiver rattle in his flight.

9890,ARGUMENT,
9891,ARGUMENT,"LXXXIX. Elsewhere to Turnus, as he raged, and marred"

9901,ARGUMENT,XC. Down through his throat into the chest it passed.
9902,ARGUMENT,Out from the dark pit gushed a foaming tide;
9903,ARGUMENT,"The cold steel, warming in the lung, stood fast."
9904,ARGUMENT,"Then Merops, Erymas, Aphidnus died,"
9905,ARGUMENT,"And Bitias, fierce with flaming eyes of pride."
9906,ARGUMENT,No dart for him; no dart his life had ta'en.
9907,ARGUMENT,"A spear phalaric, thundering, pierced his side."
9908,ARGUMENT,"Nor bulls' tough hides, nor corselet's twisted chain,"
9909,ARGUMENT,Twice linked with golden scales the monstrous blow sustain.
9910,ARGUMENT,
9911,ARGUMENT,"XCI. Prone falls the giant in a heap. Earth groans,"
9912,ARGUMENT,"His shield above him thunders. Such the roar,"
9913,ARGUMENT,"When falls the solid pile of quarried stones,"
9914,ARGUMENT,Sunk in the sea off Baiae's echoing shore;

9926,ARGUMENT,"But when brave Pandarus saw his brother's fate,"
9927,ARGUMENT,"And marked the swerving fortune of the day,"
9928,ARGUMENT,He set his broad-built shoulders to the gate;
9929,ARGUMENT,"The groaning hinges yield, and backward rolls the weight."

9933,ARGUMENT,"Saved like himself, he rescues and receives."
9934,ARGUMENT,"Madman! who, blind to Turnus, as he pressed"
9935,ARGUMENT,"Among them, made the dreaded foe his guest."

9938,ARGUMENT,"Waves wide; strange terrors from his eyes outblaze,"
9939,ARGUMENT,And on his dazzling shield the living lightning plays.

9941,ARGUMENT,"XCIV. That hated form, those giant limbs too plain"

9943,ARGUMENT,"Then, fired with fury for his brother slain,"
9944,ARGUMENT,"Forth leaping, shouts huge Pandarus with a jeer,"

9950,ARGUMENT,
9951,ARGUMENT,"XCV. He spake. Then Pandarus a javelin threw,"
9952,ARGUMENT,"Cased in its bark, with hardened knots and dried."
9953,ARGUMENT,The breezes caught the missile as it flew;
9954,ARGUMENT,"Saturnian Juno turned the point aside,"
9955,ARGUMENT,"And fixed it in the gate. ""Ha! bravely tried!"
9956,ARGUMENT,Not so _this_ dart shalt thou escape; not so
9957,ARGUMENT,"Send I the weapon and the wound."" He cried,"
9958,ARGUMENT,"And, sword in hand, uprising to the blow,"
9959,ARGUMENT,Between the temples clave the forehead of his foe.
9960,ARGUMENT,
9961,ARGUMENT,"XCVI. The beardless cheeks, so fearful was the gash,"
9962,ARGUMENT,Gape wide. Aloud his clanging arms resound.
9963,ARGUMENT,"Earth groans beneath, as prone, amid the splash"
9964,ARGUMENT,"Of blood and brains, he sprawls upon the ground,"
9965,ARGUMENT,"And right and left hangs, severed by the wound,"
9966,ARGUMENT,"His dying head. In terror, strewn afar,"
9967,ARGUMENT,"The Trojans fly. Then, then had Turnus found"
9968,ARGUMENT,"Time and the thought to burst the town-gate's bar,"
9969,ARGUMENT,That day had seen the last of Trojans and the war.
9970,ARGUMENT,
9971,ARGUMENT,"XCVII. But lust of death, and vengeance unappeased"
9972,ARGUMENT,"Urged on the conqueror. Phalaris he slew,"
9973,ARGUMENT,"Then hamstrung Gyges, and their javelins seized,"
9974,ARGUMENT,"And hurled them at their comrades, as they flew,"
9975,ARGUMENT,For Juno nerved and strengthened him anew.
9976,ARGUMENT,"Here Halys fell, and hardy Phlegeus there,"
9977,ARGUMENT,"Pierced through his shield. Alcander down he threw,"
9978,ARGUMENT,"Prytanis, Noemon, Halius unaware,"
9979,ARGUMENT,"As on the walls they stood, and roused the battle's blare."
9980,ARGUMENT,
9981,ARGUMENT,"XCVIII. Slain, too, was Lynceus, as he ran for aid,"
9982,ARGUMENT,"Cheering his friends. Back-handed, with fierce sway,"
9983,ARGUMENT,"His right knee bent, he swung the sweeping blade,"
9984,ARGUMENT,And head and helmet tumbled far away.
9985,ARGUMENT,"Fell Clytius, Amycus expert to slay"
9986,ARGUMENT,"The wood-deer, and the venomed barb to wing,"
9987,ARGUMENT,"And Creteus, too, who loved the minstrel's lay,"
9988,ARGUMENT,"The Muses' friend, whose joy it was to sing"
9989,ARGUMENT,"Of steeds, and arms and men, and wake the lyre's sweet string."
9990,ARGUMENT,
9991,ARGUMENT,"XCIX. Then meet at length, their kinsmen's slaughter known,"
9992,ARGUMENT,"Brave Mnestheus, and Serestus fierce, and see"
9993,ARGUMENT,"Their friends in flight, and foemen in the town."
9994,ARGUMENT,"Then Mnestheus cries: ""Friends, whither would ye flee?"
9995,ARGUMENT,"What other walls, what further town have we?"
9996,ARGUMENT,"Shame on the thought, shall then a single foe,"
9997,ARGUMENT,"One man alone, O townsmen! ay, and he"
9998,ARGUMENT,"Cooped thus within your ramparts, work such woe,"
9999,ARGUMENT,Such deaths--and unavenged? and lay your choicest low?

10001,ARGUMENT,"C.  ""Is yours no pity, sluggard souls? no shame"

10004,ARGUMENT,"Fired by his words, they gather heart, and stand,"
10005,ARGUMENT,"Shoulder to shoulder, rallying in a band."
10006,ARGUMENT,"Backward, but slowly he retreats, too proud"
10007,ARGUMENT,"To turn, and seeks the ramparts hard at hand,"
10008,ARGUMENT,"Girt by the stream; while, clamouring aloud,"
10009,ARGUMENT,"Fiercer the foe press on, and larger grows the crowd."
10010,ARGUMENT,
10011,ARGUMENT,"CI. As when an angry lion, held at bay,"
10012,ARGUMENT,"And pressed with galling javelins, half in fright,"
10013,ARGUMENT,"But grim and glaring, step by step gives way,"
10014,ARGUMENT,"Too wroth to turn, too valorous for flight,"
10015,ARGUMENT,"And fain, but impotent, to wreak his spite"
10016,ARGUMENT,"Against his armed assailants; even so,"
10017,ARGUMENT,"Slowly and wavering, Turnus quits the fight,"
10018,ARGUMENT,"Boiling with rage; yet twice he charged the foe,"
10019,ARGUMENT,Twice round the walls in rout they fled before his blow.
10020,ARGUMENT,
10021,ARGUMENT,"CII. But now new hosts come swarming from the town,"
10022,ARGUMENT,"Nor Juno dares his failing force to stay,"
10023,ARGUMENT,"For Jove in wrath sent heavenly Iris down,"
10024,ARGUMENT,"Stern threats to bear, should Turnus disobey,"
10025,ARGUMENT,And longer in the Trojan camp delay.
10026,ARGUMENT,"No more his shield, nor strength of hand avail"
10027,ARGUMENT,To ward the storm; so thick the javelins play.
10028,ARGUMENT,Loud rings his helmet with the driving hail;
10029,ARGUMENT,"Rent with the volleyed stones, the solid brass-plates fail."
10030,ARGUMENT,
10031,ARGUMENT,"CIII. Reft are his plumes, and shattered by the blows"
10032,ARGUMENT,"The shield-boss. Faster still the darts they pour,"
10033,ARGUMENT,And thundering Mnestheus towers amid his foes.
10034,ARGUMENT,"Trembling with pain, exhausted, sick, and sore,"
10035,ARGUMENT,"He gasps for breath. Sweat streams from every pore,"
10036,ARGUMENT,"And, black with dust, from all his limbs descends."
10037,ARGUMENT,"Headlong, at length, he plunges from the shore,"
10038,ARGUMENT,"Clad all in arms. The yellow river bends,"
10039,ARGUMENT,"And bears him, cleansed from blood, triumphant to his friends."

10050,ARGUMENT,Latins. Jupiter as a compromise leaves the arbitrament to Fate
10051,ARGUMENT,(1-153). The siege of the Trojan camp continues. AEneas meanwhile
10052,ARGUMENT,is sailing with his Arcadian and Tuscan allies down the Tiber
10053,ARGUMENT,"(154-207). Catalogue of the helpers of AEneas, who is presently"
10054,ARGUMENT,warned by the nymphs in what peril Ascanius stands: comes in sight
10055,ARGUMENT,of the camp and with difficulty lands his men (208-369). A
10056,ARGUMENT,"hard-fought battle by the river follows, of which Pallas and Lausus"
10057,ARGUMENT,are the heroes (370-531). Pallas is killed by Turnus in single combat
10058,ARGUMENT,"(532-603). AEneas in revenge gives no quarter, but slays and slays,"
10059,ARGUMENT,"until Juno, warned by Jupiter that if she would save Turnus even for"
10060,ARGUMENT,"a time she must act at once, goes down into the battle and fashions"
10061,ARGUMENT,"in the form of AEneas a phantom, which flees before Turnus and lures"
10062,ARGUMENT,"him into a ship, by which he is miraculously carried away to his"
10063,ARGUMENT,"father's city (604-838). Mezentius takes up the command, but after"
10064,ARGUMENT,performing prodigies of valour is wounded by AEneas (839-954).
10065,ARGUMENT,"Mezentius withdraws, and his son Lausus is killed while covering his"
10066,ARGUMENT,retreat. Thereupon Mezentius gets to horse and rides back to die in
10067,ARGUMENT,a vain endeavour to avenge his son. AEneas exults over Mezentius

10321,ARGUMENT,XXVI. A thousand from Alphaeus' Tuscan town
10322,ARGUMENT,"Of Pisa, with him to the war proceed,"
10323,ARGUMENT,"In bristling ranks, all spearmen of renown."
10324,ARGUMENT,"Next, Astur--comeliest Astur--clad in weed"
10325,ARGUMENT,"Of divers hues, and glorying in his steed:"
10326,ARGUMENT,"Three hundred men from ancient Pyrgos fare,"
10327,ARGUMENT,"From Caere's home, from Minio's fruitful mead,"
10328,ARGUMENT,And they who breathe Gravisca's tainted air.
10329,ARGUMENT,"One purpose fills them all, to follow and to dare."
10330,ARGUMENT,
10331,ARGUMENT,"XXVII. Nor would I leave thee, Cinyras, untold,"
10332,ARGUMENT,"Liguria's chief, nor, though a few were thine,"
10333,ARGUMENT,"Cupavo. Emblem of his sire of old,"
10334,ARGUMENT,"The swan's white feathers on his helmet shine,"
10335,ARGUMENT,"Thy fault, O Love. When Cycnus, left to pine"
10336,ARGUMENT,"For Phaethon, the poplar shades among,"
10337,ARGUMENT,"Soothed his sad passion with the Muse divine,"
10338,ARGUMENT,Old age with hoary plumage round him clung;
10339,ARGUMENT,"Starward he soared from earth and, soaring up, still sung."
10340,ARGUMENT,
10341,ARGUMENT,"XXVIII. Now comes his son, with his Ligurian bands,"
10342,ARGUMENT,Oaring their bark. A Centaur from the prow
10343,ARGUMENT,"Looms o'er the waves a-tiptoe, with his hands"
10344,ARGUMENT,"A vast rock heaving, as in act to throw;"
10345,ARGUMENT,The long keel ploughs the furrowed deep below.
10346,ARGUMENT,"Next, from his home the gallant Ocnus came,"
10347,ARGUMENT,"The son of Manto, who the Fates doth know,"
10348,ARGUMENT,Brave child of Tiber. He his mother's name
10349,ARGUMENT,"And walls to Mantua gave,--great Mantua, rich in fame,"
10350,ARGUMENT,
10351,ARGUMENT,"XXIX. And rich in heroes, though diversely bred."
10352,ARGUMENT,"Three separate stems four-fold the state compose,"
10353,ARGUMENT,"Herself, of Tuscan origin, the head."
10354,ARGUMENT,"Five hundred warriors, all Mezentius' foes,"
10355,ARGUMENT,"And armed for vengeance, from her walls arose."
10356,ARGUMENT,"Mincius in front, veiled in his sedges grey"
10357,ARGUMENT,"(Fair stream, whose birth from sire Benacus flows),"
10358,ARGUMENT,"Shines on the poop, and seaward points the way;"
10359,ARGUMENT,"Swift speeds the bark of pine, with foemen for the fray."
10360,ARGUMENT,
10361,ARGUMENT,"XXX. Last, huge Aulestes, rising with his row"
10362,ARGUMENT,"Of hundred oarsmen, beats the watery lea."
10363,ARGUMENT,The lashed deeps boil; big Triton from the prow
10364,ARGUMENT,"Sounds his loud shell, that frights the sky-blue sea."
10365,ARGUMENT,"Waist-high, a man with human face is he;"
10366,ARGUMENT,"All else, a fish; beneath his savage breast"
10367,ARGUMENT,"The white foam roars before him.--Such to see,"
10368,ARGUMENT,"Such, and so numerous was the host that pressed,"
10369,ARGUMENT,"Borne in their thirty ships, to succour Troy distrest."
10370,ARGUMENT,
10371,ARGUMENT,XXXI. Daylight had failed; to mid Olympus' gate
10372,ARGUMENT,Bright Phoebe drove her nightly-wandering wain.
10373,ARGUMENT,"Tiller in hand, the good AEneas sate"
10374,ARGUMENT,"And trimmed the sails, while trouble tossed his brain."
10375,ARGUMENT,"When lo! around him thronged the Sea-nymphs' train,"
10376,ARGUMENT,Whom kind Cybele changed from ships of wood
10377,ARGUMENT,"To rule, as goddesses, the watery main."
10378,ARGUMENT,"As many as late, with brazen beaks, had stood"
10379,ARGUMENT,"Linked to the shore, now swim in even line the flood."
10380,ARGUMENT,
10381,ARGUMENT,"XXXII. Far off, their king the goddesses beheld"
10382,ARGUMENT,"And danced around him joyously, and lo,"
10383,ARGUMENT,"Cymodocea, who in speech excelled,"
10384,ARGUMENT,Clings to the stern; breast-high the nymph doth show;
10385,ARGUMENT,Her left hand oars the placid deep below.
10386,ARGUMENT,"Then, ""Watchest thou, AEneas, child divine?"
10387,ARGUMENT,"Watch on,"" she cries, ""and let the canvas go."
10388,ARGUMENT,"Behold us, sea-nymphs, once a grove of pine"
10389,ARGUMENT,"On Ida's sacred crest, the Trojans' ships and thine."
10390,ARGUMENT,
10391,ARGUMENT,"XXXIII. ""When on us late the false Rutulian pressed"
10392,ARGUMENT,"With sword and flame, perforce, sweet life to save,"
10393,ARGUMENT,"We broke our chains, and wander in thy quest."
10394,ARGUMENT,"Our shape the Mother, pitying, changed and gave"
10395,ARGUMENT,"Immortal life, to spend beneath the wave."
10396,ARGUMENT,"Thy son, he stays in Latin leaguer pent;"
10397,ARGUMENT,"Arcadian horsemen, with the Tuscans brave,"
10398,ARGUMENT,"Hold tryst to aid. His troops hath Turnus sent,"
10399,ARGUMENT,"Charged, with opposing arms, their succour to prevent."
10400,ARGUMENT,
10401,ARGUMENT,"XXXIV. ""Now rise, and when to-morrow's dawn shall shine,"
10402,ARGUMENT,"Bid forth thy followers to arms. Be bold,"
10403,ARGUMENT,"And take this shield, the Fire-King's gift divine,"
10404,ARGUMENT,"Invincible, immortal, rimm'd with gold."
10405,ARGUMENT,Next morn--so truly as the word is told--
10406,ARGUMENT,"Huge heaps of dead Rutulian foes shall view."""
10407,ARGUMENT,"She spake; her hand, departing, loosed its hold,"
10408,ARGUMENT,And pushed the vessel; well the way she knew;
10409,ARGUMENT,Swift as a dart it flies; the rest its flight pursue.
10410,ARGUMENT,
10411,ARGUMENT,"XXXV. Wondering, AEneas pauses in amaze,"
10412,ARGUMENT,"Yet hails the sign, and gladdens at the sight,"
10413,ARGUMENT,"And, gazing on the vaulted skies, he prays,"
10414,ARGUMENT,"""Mother of Heaven, whom Dindymus' famed height,"
10415,ARGUMENT,"And tower-girt towns, and lions yoked delight,"
10416,ARGUMENT,"Assist the Phrygians, and direct the fray."
10417,ARGUMENT,"Kind Goddess, prosper us, and speed aright"
10418,ARGUMENT,"This augury."" He ended, and the day"
10419,ARGUMENT,"Returning, climbed the sky, and chased the night away."
10420,ARGUMENT,
10421,ARGUMENT,XXXVI. Forthwith he calls his comrades to arise
10422,ARGUMENT,"And take fresh heart, and for the fight prepare."
10423,ARGUMENT,"Now, from the stern, the Dardans he espies,"
10424,ARGUMENT,Hemmed in their camp. Aloft his hands upbear
10425,ARGUMENT,The burning shield. With shouts his Dardans tear
10426,ARGUMENT,Heaven's concave. Hope with fury fires their veins.
10427,ARGUMENT,"Fast fly their darts, as when through darkened air"
10428,ARGUMENT,With clang and clamour the Strymonian cranes
10429,ARGUMENT,"Stream forth, the signal given, from winter's winds and rains."
10430,ARGUMENT,
10431,ARGUMENT,"XXXVII. Then lost in wonderment, the foemen stand,"
10432,ARGUMENT,"Till, looking round, they see the watery ways"
10433,ARGUMENT,"A sea of ships, all crowding to the land,"
10434,ARGUMENT,"The flaming crest, the helmet all ablaze,"
10435,ARGUMENT,"The golden shield-boss, with its lightning rays."
10436,ARGUMENT,"As when a comet, bright with blazing hair,"
10437,ARGUMENT,"Its blood-red beams athwart the night displays,"
10438,ARGUMENT,"Or Sirius, rising, with its baleful glare"
10439,ARGUMENT,"Brings pestilence and drought, and saddens all the air."
10440,ARGUMENT,
10441,ARGUMENT,XXXVIII. Yet quails not Turnus; still his hopes are high
10442,ARGUMENT,"To seize the shore, and keep them from the land."
10443,ARGUMENT,"Now cheering, and now chiding, rings his cry"
10444,ARGUMENT,"""Lo, here--'tis here, the battle ye demand."
10445,ARGUMENT,"Up, crush them; war is in the warrior's hand."
10446,ARGUMENT,"Think of your fathers and their deeds of old,"
10447,ARGUMENT,"Your homes, your wives. Forestall them on the strand,"
10448,ARGUMENT,"Now, while they totter, while the foot's faint hold"
10449,ARGUMENT,"Slips on the shelving beach. Fair Fortune aids the bold."""
10450,ARGUMENT,
10451,ARGUMENT,"XXXIX. So saying, he ponders inly, whom to choose"
10452,ARGUMENT,"To mind the siege, and whom the foe to meet."
10453,ARGUMENT,By planks meanwhile AEneas lands his crews.
10454,ARGUMENT,"Some wait until the languid waves retreat,"
10455,ARGUMENT,"Then, leaping, to the shallows trust their feet;"
10456,ARGUMENT,"Some vault with oars. Brave Tarchon marks, quick-eyed,"
10457,ARGUMENT,"A sheltered spot, where neither surf doth beat,"
10458,ARGUMENT,"Nor breakers roar, but smooth the waters glide,"
10459,ARGUMENT,And up the sloping shore unbroken swells the tide.
10460,ARGUMENT,
10461,ARGUMENT,"XL. Here suddenly he bids them turn the prow,"
10462,ARGUMENT,"And shouts aloud, ""Now, now, my chosen band,"
10463,ARGUMENT,Lean to your oars; strive lustily and row.
10464,ARGUMENT,"Lift the keel onward, till it cleaves the strand,"
10465,ARGUMENT,And ploughs its furrow in the foeman's land.
10466,ARGUMENT,"Let the bark break, with such a haven here"
10467,ARGUMENT,"What harm, if once upon the shore we stand?"""
10468,ARGUMENT,"So Tarchon spake; his comrades, with a cheer,"
10469,ARGUMENT,"Rise on the smooth-shaved thwarts, and sweep the foaming mere."
10470,ARGUMENT,
10471,ARGUMENT,"XLI. So, one by one, they gain the land, and, whole"
10472,ARGUMENT,"And scatheless, on the Latin shore abide."
10473,ARGUMENT,"All safe but Tarchon. Dashed upon a shoal,"
10474,ARGUMENT,"Long on a rock's unequal ridge astride,"
10475,ARGUMENT,"In doubtful balance swayed from side to side,"
10476,ARGUMENT,"His vessel hangs, and back the waves doth beat,"
10477,ARGUMENT,"Then breaks, and leaves them tangled in the tide"
10478,ARGUMENT,"'Twixt planks and oars, while, ebbing to retreat,"
10479,ARGUMENT,"The shrinking waves draw back, and wash them from their feet."
10480,ARGUMENT,
10481,ARGUMENT,"XLII. Nor loiters Turnus; eager to attack,"
10482,ARGUMENT,"Along the shore he marshals his array,"
10483,ARGUMENT,"To meet the foe, and drive the Teucrians back."
10484,ARGUMENT,The trumpet sounds: the Latin churls straightway
10485,ARGUMENT,"AEneas routs, first omen of the day,"
10486,ARGUMENT,"Huge Theron slain, their mightiest, who in pride"
10487,ARGUMENT,"Of strength, rushed forth and dared him to the fray."
10488,ARGUMENT,"Through quilted brass the Dardan sword he plied,"
10489,ARGUMENT,"Through tunic stiff with gold, and pierced th' unguarded side."
10490,ARGUMENT,
10491,ARGUMENT,"XLIII. Lichas he smites, who vowed his infant life,"
10492,ARGUMENT,"Ripped from his mother, dying in her pain,"
10493,ARGUMENT,"To Phoebus, freed from perils of the knife."
10494,ARGUMENT,"Huge Gyas, brawny Cisseus press the plain,"
10495,ARGUMENT,"As, club in hand, they strew the Tuscan train."
10496,ARGUMENT,"Naught now avail those stalwart arms, that plied"
10497,ARGUMENT,The weapons of Alcides; all in vain
10498,ARGUMENT,"They boast their sire Melampus, comrade tried"
10499,ARGUMENT,"Of Hercules, while earth his toilsome tasks supplied."
10500,ARGUMENT,
10501,ARGUMENT,"XLIV. Lo, full at Pharus, in his bawling mouth"
10502,ARGUMENT,"He plants a dart. Thou, Cydon, too, in quest"
10503,ARGUMENT,"Of Clytius, blooming with the down of youth,"
10504,ARGUMENT,"Thy latest joy, had'st laid thy loves to rest,"
10505,ARGUMENT,Slain by the Dardan; but around thee pressed
10506,ARGUMENT,"Old Phorcus' sons. Seven brethren bold are there,"
10507,ARGUMENT,"Seven darts they throw. These helm and shield arrest,"
10508,ARGUMENT,"Those, turned aside by Venus' gentle care"
10509,ARGUMENT,"Just graze the Dardan's frame, and, grazing, glance in air."
10510,ARGUMENT,
10511,ARGUMENT,"XLV. Then cried AEneas to Achates true,"
10512,ARGUMENT,"""Quick, hand me store of weapons; none in vain"
10513,ARGUMENT,"This arm shall hurl at yon Rutulian crew,"
10514,ARGUMENT,Not one of all that whilom knew the stain
10515,ARGUMENT,"Of Argive blood upon the Trojan plain."""
10516,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he snatched, and in a moment threw"
10517,ARGUMENT,"His mighty spear, that, hurtling, rent in twain"
10518,ARGUMENT,"The brazen plates of Maeon's shield, and through"
10519,ARGUMENT,"The breastplate pierced the breast, nor faltered as it flew."
10520,ARGUMENT,
10521,ARGUMENT,"XLVI. Up ran, and raised his brother, as he lay,"
10522,ARGUMENT,"Alcanor. Shrill another javelin sung,"
10523,ARGUMENT,"And pierced his arm, and, reddening, held its way,"
10524,ARGUMENT,And from his shoulders by the sinews hung
10525,ARGUMENT,"The dying hand. Then straight, the dart outwrung,"
10526,ARGUMENT,His brother Numitor the barb let fly
10527,ARGUMENT,"Full at AEneas. In his face he flung,"
10528,ARGUMENT,"But failed to smite. The weapon, turned awry,"
10529,ARGUMENT,"Missed the intended mark, and grazed Achates' thigh."
10530,ARGUMENT,
10531,ARGUMENT,"XLVII. Up Clausus came, of Cures, in the pride"
10532,ARGUMENT,"Of youth. His stark spear, urged with forceful sway,"
10533,ARGUMENT,"Through Dryops' throat, beneath the chin, he plied,"
10534,ARGUMENT,"And voice and life forsook him, as he lay,"
10535,ARGUMENT,"Spewing thick gore, his forehead in the clay."
10536,ARGUMENT,"Three Thracians next, three sons of Idas bleed."
10537,ARGUMENT,Ismarians these. Halaesus to the fray
10538,ARGUMENT,"Brings his Auruncan bands, and Neptune's seed,"
10539,ARGUMENT,"Messapus, too, comes up, the tamer of the steed."
10540,ARGUMENT,
10541,ARGUMENT,XLVIII. Each side strives hard the other's ground to win.
10542,ARGUMENT,E'en on Ausonia's threshold raves the fray.
10543,ARGUMENT,As in the broad air warring winds begin
10544,ARGUMENT,"The battle, matched in strength and rage, nor they,"
10545,ARGUMENT,"The winds themselves, nor clouds nor sea give way,"
10546,ARGUMENT,"All locked in strife, and struggling as they can,"
10547,ARGUMENT,"And long in doubtful balance hangs the day,"
10548,ARGUMENT,"So meet the ranks, and mingle in the van,"
10549,ARGUMENT,"And foot clings close to foot, and man is massed with man."
10550,ARGUMENT,
10551,ARGUMENT,"XLIX. Where, in another quarter, stones and trees,"
10552,ARGUMENT,"Torn from its banks, a torrent at its height"
10553,ARGUMENT,"Had strewn with wide-wrought ravage, Pallas sees"
10554,ARGUMENT,"His brave Arcadians break the ranks of fight,"
10555,ARGUMENT,And turn before their Latin foes in flight.
10556,ARGUMENT,"Strange to foot-combat, from his trusty horse"
10557,ARGUMENT,The rough ground lured each rider to alight.
10558,ARGUMENT,Now with entreaties--'tis his last resource--
10559,ARGUMENT,And now with bitter words he fires their flagging force.
10560,ARGUMENT,
10561,ARGUMENT,"L.  ""Shame on ye, comrades! whither do ye run?"
10562,ARGUMENT,"By your brave deeds, and by the name ye bear,"
10563,ARGUMENT,"And great Evander's, by the wars ye won,"
10564,ARGUMENT,"By these my hopes, which even now bid fair"
10565,ARGUMENT,E'en with my father's honours to compare.
10566,ARGUMENT,"Trust not your feet; the sword, the sword must hew"
10567,ARGUMENT,"A pathway through the foemen. See, 'tis there,"
10568,ARGUMENT,"Where foes press thickest, and our friends are few,"
10569,ARGUMENT,Our noble country calls for Pallas and for you.
10570,ARGUMENT,
10571,ARGUMENT,"LI. ""No gods assail us; mortals fight to-day"
10572,ARGUMENT,"With mortals. Lives as many as theirs have we,"
10573,ARGUMENT,"As many hands, to match them in the fray."
10574,ARGUMENT,"Earth fails for flight, and yonder lies the sea."
10575,ARGUMENT,"Seaward or Troyward--whither shall we flee?"""
10576,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he plunged amid the throng. First foe,"
10577,ARGUMENT,"Fell Lagus, doomed an evil fate to dree."
10578,ARGUMENT,"Him, toiling hard a ponderous stone to throw,"
10579,ARGUMENT,Between the ribs and spine a whistling dart laid low.
10580,ARGUMENT,
10581,ARGUMENT,LII. Scarce from his marrow could the victor tear
10582,ARGUMENT,"The steel, so tightly clung it to the bone."
10583,ARGUMENT,"Forth Hisbo leaped, to smite him unaware."
10584,ARGUMENT,"Rash hope! brave Pallas caught him, rushing on,"
10585,ARGUMENT,And through the lung his sword a passage won.
10586,ARGUMENT,Then Sthenius he slew; beside him bled
10587,ARGUMENT,"Anchemolus, of Rhoetus' stock the son,"
10588,ARGUMENT,The lewd defiler of his stepdame's bed.
10589,ARGUMENT,"Fate stopped his lewdness now, and stretched him with the dead."
10590,ARGUMENT,
10591,ARGUMENT,"LIII. Ye, too, young Thymber and Larides fair,"
10592,ARGUMENT,"Twin sons of Daucus, did the victor quell."
10593,ARGUMENT,"So like in form and features were the pair,"
10594,ARGUMENT,That e'en their doting parents failed to tell
10595,ARGUMENT,This one from that. Alas! the sword too well
10596,ARGUMENT,"Divides them now. Here, tumbled on the sward,"
10597,ARGUMENT,"At one fierce swoop, the head of Thymber fell."
10598,ARGUMENT,"Thy severed hand, Larides, seeks its lord;"
10599,ARGUMENT,"The fingers, half alive and quivering, clutch the sword."
10600,ARGUMENT,
10601,ARGUMENT,"LIV. Fired by his words, his deeds the Arcadians view,"
10602,ARGUMENT,And shame and anger arm them to the fray.
10603,ARGUMENT,"Rhoeteus, as past his two-horsed chariot flew"
10604,ARGUMENT,"He pierced,--'twas Ilus Pallas meant to slay,"
10605,ARGUMENT,And Ilus gained that moment of delay.
10606,ARGUMENT,"Rhoeteus, in flight from Teuthras and from thee,"
10607,ARGUMENT,"His brother Tyres, met the spear midway."
10608,ARGUMENT,"Down from his chariot in the dust rolled he,"
10609,ARGUMENT,"And, dying, with his heels beat the Rutulian lea."
10610,ARGUMENT,
10611,ARGUMENT,"LV. As when a shepherd, on a summer's day,"
10612,ARGUMENT,"The wished-for winds arising, hastes to cast"
10613,ARGUMENT,"The flames amid the stubble: far away,"
10614,ARGUMENT,"The mid space seized, the line of fire runs fast"
10615,ARGUMENT,"From field to field, and broadens with the blast:"
10616,ARGUMENT,"And, sitting down, the victor from a height"
10617,ARGUMENT,"Surveys the triumph, as the flames rush past."
10618,ARGUMENT,"So all Arcadia's chivalry unite,"
10619,ARGUMENT,"And round thee, Pallas, throng, and aid thee in the fight."
10620,ARGUMENT,
10621,ARGUMENT,"LVI. But lo, from out the foemen's ranks, athirst"
10622,ARGUMENT,"For battle, fierce Halesus charged, and drew"
10623,ARGUMENT,"His covering shield before him. Ladon first,"
10624,ARGUMENT,"Then Pheres, then Demodocus he slew."
10625,ARGUMENT,"Next, at his throat as bold Strymonius flew,"
10626,ARGUMENT,The glittering falchion severed at a blow
10627,ARGUMENT,The lifted hand. At Thoas' face he threw
10628,ARGUMENT,"A stone, that smashed the forehead of his foe,"
10629,ARGUMENT,"And bones, and blood, and brains the spattered earth bestrow."
10630,ARGUMENT,
10631,ARGUMENT,"LVII. Halesus, when a boy, in woods concealed,"
10632,ARGUMENT,"His sire, a seer, had reared with tender care."
10633,ARGUMENT,"But soon as death the old man's eyes had sealed,"
10634,ARGUMENT,Fate marked the son for the Evandrian spear.
10635,ARGUMENT,"Him Pallas sought; ""O Tiber!"" was his prayer,"
10636,ARGUMENT,"""True to Halesus let this javelin go."
10637,ARGUMENT,"His arms and spoils thy sacred oak shall bear."""
10638,ARGUMENT,"'Twas heard: Halesus, shielding from the foe"
10639,ARGUMENT,"Imaon, leaves his breast unguarded to the blow."
10640,ARGUMENT,
10641,ARGUMENT,"LVIII. Firm Lausus stands, bearing the battle's brunt,"
10642,ARGUMENT,Nor lets Halesus' death his friends dismay.
10643,ARGUMENT,"Dead falls the first who meets him front to front,"
10644,ARGUMENT,"Brave Abas, knot and holdfast of the fray."
10645,ARGUMENT,"Down go Arcadia's chivalry that day,"
10646,ARGUMENT,"Down go the Etruscans, and the Teucrians, those"
10647,ARGUMENT,Whom Grecian conquerors had failed to slay.
10648,ARGUMENT,"Man locked with man, amid the conflict's throes,"
10649,ARGUMENT,"With strength and leaders matched, the rival armies close."
10650,ARGUMENT,
10651,ARGUMENT,"LIX. On press the rearmost, crowding on the van,"
10652,ARGUMENT,"So thick, that neither hand can stir, nor spear"
10653,ARGUMENT,Be wielded; each one struggles as he can.
10654,ARGUMENT,"Here Pallas, there brave Lausus, charge and cheer,"
10655,ARGUMENT,"Two foes, in age scarce differing by a year."
10656,ARGUMENT,Both fair of form. Stern Fate to each forbade
10657,ARGUMENT,His home return. But Jove allowed not here
10658,ARGUMENT,"A meeting; he who great Olympus swayed,"
10659,ARGUMENT,Awhile for mightier foes their destined doom delayed.
10660,ARGUMENT,
10661,ARGUMENT,"LX. Warned by his gracious sister, Turnus flies"
10662,ARGUMENT,To take the place of Lausus. Driving through
10663,ARGUMENT,"The ranks, ""Stand off,"" he shouts to his allies,"
10664,ARGUMENT,"""I fight with Pallas; Pallas is my due."
10665,ARGUMENT,"Would that his sire were here himself to view!"""
10666,ARGUMENT,"All clear the field. Then, pondering with surprise"
10667,ARGUMENT,"The proud command, as back the crowd withdrew,"
10668,ARGUMENT,"The youth, amazed at Turnus, rolls his eyes"
10669,ARGUMENT,"And scans his giant foe, and thus in scorn replies:"
10670,ARGUMENT,
10671,ARGUMENT,"LXI. ""Or kingly spoils shall make me famed to-day,"
10672,ARGUMENT,"Or glorious death. Whatever end remain,"
10673,ARGUMENT,"My sire can bear it. Put thy threats away."""
10674,ARGUMENT,Then forth he stepped; cold horror chills his train.
10675,ARGUMENT,"Down from his car, close combat to darrain,"
10676,ARGUMENT,"Leapt Turnus. As a lion, who far away"
10677,ARGUMENT,"Has marked a bull, that butts the sandy plain"
10678,ARGUMENT,"For battle, springs to grapple with his prey;"
10679,ARGUMENT,"So dreadful Turnus looks, advancing to the fray."
10680,ARGUMENT,
10681,ARGUMENT,"LXII. Him, deemed within his spear-throw, undismayed"
10682,ARGUMENT,"The youth prevents, if chance the odds should square,"
10683,ARGUMENT,"And aid his daring. To the skies he prayed,"
10684,ARGUMENT,"""O thou, my father's guest-friend, wont whilere"
10685,ARGUMENT,"A stranger's welcome at his board to share,"
10686,ARGUMENT,"Aid me, Alcides, prosper my emprise;"
10687,ARGUMENT,"Let Turnus fall, and, falling, see me tear"
10688,ARGUMENT,"His blood-stained arms, and may his swooning eyes"
10689,ARGUMENT,"Meet mine, and bear the victor's image, when he dies."""
10690,ARGUMENT,
10691,ARGUMENT,"LXIII. Alcides heard, and, stifling in his breast"
10692,ARGUMENT,"A deep groan, poured his unavailing grief."
10693,ARGUMENT,Whom thus the Sire with kindly words addressed:
10694,ARGUMENT,"""Each hath his day; irreparably brief"

10696,ARGUMENT,'Tis valour's part to bid it bloom anew

10698,ARGUMENT,Dead lies my son Sarpedon. Turnus too
10699,ARGUMENT,"His proper Fates demand; his destined hour is due."""
10700,ARGUMENT,
10701,ARGUMENT,"LXIV. So saying, he turned, and shunned the scene of death."
10702,ARGUMENT,"Forth Pallas hurled the spear with all his might,"
10703,ARGUMENT,And snatched the glittering falchion from the sheath.
10704,ARGUMENT,"Where the shield's top just matched the shoulders' height,"
10705,ARGUMENT,"Clean through the rim, the javelin winged its flight,"
10706,ARGUMENT,"And grazed the flesh. Then Turnus, poising slow"
10707,ARGUMENT,"His oakbeam, tipt with iron sharp and bright,"
10708,ARGUMENT,"Took aim, and, hurling, shouted to his foe,"
10709,ARGUMENT,"""See, now, if this my lance can deal a deadlier blow."""
10710,ARGUMENT,
10711,ARGUMENT,"LXV. He spake, and through the midmost shield, o'erlaid"
10712,ARGUMENT,"With bull-hide, brass, and iron, welded hard,"
10713,ARGUMENT,"Whizzed the keen javelin, nor its course delayed,"
10714,ARGUMENT,But pierced the broad breast through the corslet's guard.
10715,ARGUMENT,"He the warm weapon, in the wound embarred,"
10716,ARGUMENT,"Wrenched, writhing in his agony; in vain;"
10717,ARGUMENT,Out gushed the life and life-blood. O'er him jarred
10718,ARGUMENT,"His clanging armour, as he rolled in pain."
10719,ARGUMENT,"Dying, with bloody mouth he bites the hostile plain."
10720,ARGUMENT,
10721,ARGUMENT,"LXVI. Then Turnus, standing o'er the dead, ""Go to,"
10722,ARGUMENT,"Arcadians, hear and let Evander know,"
10723,ARGUMENT,"I send back Pallas, handled as was due."
10724,ARGUMENT,"If aught of honour can a tomb bestow,"
10725,ARGUMENT,"If earth's cold lap yield solace to his woe,"
10726,ARGUMENT,I grant it. Dearly will his Dardan guest
10727,ARGUMENT,"Cost him, I trow."" Then, trampling on the foe,"
10728,ARGUMENT,"His left foot on the lifeless corpse he pressed,"
10729,ARGUMENT,And tore the ponderous belt in triumph from his breast;
10730,ARGUMENT,
10731,ARGUMENT,"LXVII. The belt, whereon the tale of guilt was told,--"
10732,ARGUMENT,"The wedding night, the couches smeared with gore,"
10733,ARGUMENT,"The bridegrooms slain--which Clonus in the gold,"
10734,ARGUMENT,"The son of Eurytus, had grav'n of yore,"
10735,ARGUMENT,"And Turnus now, exulting, seized and wore."
10736,ARGUMENT,"Vain mortals! triumphing past bounds to-day,"
10737,ARGUMENT,Blind to to-morrow's destiny. The hour
10738,ARGUMENT,"Shall come, when gold in plenty would he pay"
10739,ARGUMENT,"Ne'er Pallas to have touched, and curse the costly prey."
10740,ARGUMENT,
10741,ARGUMENT,LXVIII. With tears his comrades lifted from the ground
10742,ARGUMENT,"Dead Pallas; groaning, on his shield they bore"
10743,ARGUMENT,"Him homeward, and the bitter wail went round."
10744,ARGUMENT,"""O grief! O glory! fall'n to rise no more!"
10745,ARGUMENT,"Thus back we bring thee, thus the son restore!"
10746,ARGUMENT,"One day to battle gave thee, one hath ta'en,"
10747,ARGUMENT,Victor and vanquished in the self-same hour!
10748,ARGUMENT,"Yet fall'n with honour, for behind thee slain,"
10749,ARGUMENT,"Heaps of Rutulian foes thou leavest on the plain!"""
10750,ARGUMENT,
10751,ARGUMENT,"LXIX. Sure tidings to AEneas came apace,--"
10752,ARGUMENT,'Twas no mere rumour--of his friends in flight;

10756,ARGUMENT,"Thee, haughty Turnus, thee he burns to find,"
10757,ARGUMENT,"Hot with new blood, and glorying in thy might."
10758,ARGUMENT,"The sire, the son, the welcome warm and kind,"
10759,ARGUMENT,"The feast, the parting grasp--all crowd upon his mind."

10763,ARGUMENT,"Poor victims, doomed to feed the funeral fire,"
10764,ARGUMENT,And pour their blood in quittance for the dead.
10765,ARGUMENT,Then from afar a bitter shaft he sped
10766,ARGUMENT,At Magus. Warily he stoops below

10768,ARGUMENT,"And, like a suppliant, crouching to his foe,"
10769,ARGUMENT,"Clings to AEneas' knees, and cries in words of woe:"

10804,ARGUMENT,Still rages. First from Anxur with a blow
10805,ARGUMENT,His sword the shield-arm and the shield laid low.
10806,ARGUMENT,"Big things had Anxur boasted, empty jeers,"
10807,ARGUMENT,And deemed his valour with his vaunts would grow:
10808,ARGUMENT,"Perchance, with spirit lifted to the spheres,"
10809,ARGUMENT,"Hoar hairs he looked to see, and length of peaceful years."

10884,ARGUMENT,"Deep in the breast he stabbed him as he lay,"

10932,ARGUMENT,Strange sight to see!--a thin and strengthless shade
10933,ARGUMENT,"Shaped like the great AEneas, and endowed"
10934,ARGUMENT,"With Dardan arms, and fixed the shield, and spread"
10935,ARGUMENT,The plume and crest as on his godlike head.
10936,ARGUMENT,"And empty words, a soulless sound, she gave,"
10937,ARGUMENT,And feigned the fashion of the warrior's tread.
10938,ARGUMENT,Thus ghosts are said to glide above the grave;
10939,ARGUMENT,Thus oft delusive dreams the slumbering sense enslave.

11093,ARGUMENT,"Like huge Orion, when with ample stride"
11094,ARGUMENT,"He cleaves the deep-sea, where the Nereids reign,"

11124,ARGUMENT,"And linen folds, and triple bull-hides flew,"

11159,ARGUMENT,Hilt-deep within his breast the falchion urged its way.

11163,ARGUMENT,And drenched with gore the tunic and the breast.
11164,ARGUMENT,"Sweet life, departing, left the limbs outspread,"
11165,ARGUMENT,And the sad spirit to the ghost-world fled.
11166,ARGUMENT,But when the son of great Anchises scanned
11167,ARGUMENT,"The face, the pallid features of the dead,"
11168,ARGUMENT,"Deeply he groaned, and stretched a pitying hand."
11169,ARGUMENT,Grief for his own dear sire his noble soul unmanned.

11181,ARGUMENT,"CXII. Meanwhile the sire Mezentius, faint with pain,"
11182,ARGUMENT,In Tiber's waters bathes the bleeding wound.
11183,ARGUMENT,Against a trunk he leans; the boughs sustain
11184,ARGUMENT,His brazen helm; his arms upon the ground
11185,ARGUMENT,"Rest idly, and his comrades stand around."
11186,ARGUMENT,"Sick, gasping, spent, his weary neck he tends;"
11187,ARGUMENT,Loose o'er his bosom floats the beard unbound.
11188,ARGUMENT,"Oft of his son he questions, oft he sends"
11189,ARGUMENT,"To bid him quit the field, and seek his sire and friends."

11192,ARGUMENT,"Bear back the lifeless Lausus from the field,"
11193,ARGUMENT,"Weeping--the mighty by a mightier slain,"
11194,ARGUMENT,And laid in death upon the warrior's shield.
11195,ARGUMENT,"Far off, their wailing to the sire revealed"
11196,ARGUMENT,"The grief, that made his boding heart mistrust."
11197,ARGUMENT,"In agony of vanquish, down he kneeled,"
11198,ARGUMENT,"His hoary hairs disfiguring with the dust,"
11199,ARGUMENT,"And, grovelling, clasped the corpse, and both his hands outthrust."

11205,ARGUMENT,"Saved by thy wounds, and living by thy doom?"
11206,ARGUMENT,Ah! woe is me; too well at length I own
11207,ARGUMENT,"The pangs of exile, and the wound strikes home."
11208,ARGUMENT,"'Twas I, thy name who tarnished, I alone,"
11209,ARGUMENT,Whom just resentment thrust from sceptre and from throne.

11215,ARGUMENT,"Then, slowly leaning on his crippled thigh"

11229,ARGUMENT,"Swift at the ranks spurred forth, his dreaded foe to meet."
11230,ARGUMENT,
11231,ARGUMENT,CXVII. Each hand a keen dart brandished; o'er his head
11232,ARGUMENT,Gleamed the brass helmet with its horse-hair crest.
11233,ARGUMENT,"Shame for himself, and sorrow for the dead,"
11234,ARGUMENT,"The parent's anguish, and the warrior's zest,"
11235,ARGUMENT,"Thrilled through his veins, and kindled in his breast,"

11249,ARGUMENT,In widening orbs he wheels; the good shield bides the blow.
11250,ARGUMENT,
11251,ARGUMENT,"CXIX. Thrice round AEneas leftward he careers,"
11252,ARGUMENT,"Raining his darts. Thrice, shifting round, each way"

11295,ARGUMENT,praises AEneas and counsels submission (263-336). An anxious debate
11296,ARGUMENT,follows: Latinus suggests terms of peace: Drances inveighs against
11297,ARGUMENT,"Turnus, who replies, protesting his readiness to meet AEneas in"
11298,ARGUMENT,"single combat, and presently seizes the opportunity afforded by a"
11299,ARGUMENT,false alarm of impending attack to break up the council. The Latin
11300,ARGUMENT,mothers and maidens offer gifts and litanies to Pallas. Turnus arms
11301,ARGUMENT,for battle (337-576). Camilla and Messapus command the Latin horse;
11302,ARGUMENT,Turnus prepares an ambuscade (577-612). Diana tells the story of
11303,ARGUMENT,"Camilla and charges Opis, one of her nymphs, to avenge her should"
11304,ARGUMENT,she fall (613-684). Opis watches the battle before the city of
11305,ARGUMENT,Latinus (685-738). The deeds and death of Camilla are recounted:
11306,ARGUMENT,"Aruns, her slayer, is slain by Opis (739-972). The Latins are routed,"
11307,ARGUMENT,"and Turnus, learning the news, abandons the ambush and hurries to"

12459,ARGUMENT,Turnus realises that he must now redeem his promise to meet AEneas
12460,ARGUMENT,"in single combat, and refuses to be dissuaded either by Latinus or"
12461,ARGUMENT,"by Amata (1-90). The challenge is sent, and the two make ready. Lists"
12462,ARGUMENT,are prepared and spectators gather (91-153). Juno warns the Nymph

12465,ARGUMENT,by an opportune omen induces one of the assembled Latins to break
12466,ARGUMENT,the truce and kill a Trojan (181-310). AEneas is wounded while
12467,ARGUMENT,"endeavouring to restrain his men from reprisals, and the fray becomes"
12468,ARGUMENT,general. Turnus deals death among the Trojans (311-441). AEneas is

12471,ARGUMENT,"anger and slays indiscriminately, until by Venus' advice he attacks"

12474,ARGUMENT,"returns and proclaims himself ready to meet AEneas, who, welcoming"
12475,ARGUMENT,"the challenge, rushes forward. All eyes are riveted on the two, when"
12476,ARGUMENT,"Turnus' sword breaks, and once more he flees, pursued by AEneas."
12477,ARGUMENT,"Juturna gives Turnus another sword, and Venus restores to AEneas his"
12478,ARGUMENT,spear (703-918). Follows a colloquy between Jupiter and
12479,ARGUMENT,Juno.--Turnus must die. AEneas shall marry Lavinia and be king. But
12480,ARGUMENT,"the new nation must keep the ancient rites and names of Latium, and"
12481,ARGUMENT,"be called not Trojans but Latins. Juno yields, and Jupiter warns"
12482,ARGUMENT,"Juturna to leave the battle (919-1026). Turnus, being beside himself,"
12483,ARGUMENT,"after a last superhuman effort, is struck down. AEneas is about to"
12484,ARGUMENT,"spare his life, when he sees upon his shoulder the spoils of Pallas,"
12485,ARGUMENT,and kills him (1027-1107).

12871,ARGUMENT,"Behind him close, and o'er his foeman hung."
12872,ARGUMENT,"He turning round his broad axe backward swung,"

12896,ARGUMENT,And none was found to boast of great AEneas' wound.

12898,ARGUMENT,"XLII. When Turnus saw the Trojan prince retire,"
12899,ARGUMENT,"The chiefs bewildered, and their hearts unstrung,"
12900,ARGUMENT,"Hope unexpected set his soul on fire,"
12901,ARGUMENT,"And, calling for his steeds and arms, he sprung"

12940,ARGUMENT,"And, lightly leaping from his two-horsed car,"
12941,ARGUMENT,"Stamps on his neck, fall'n breathless on the sand,"
12942,ARGUMENT,And wrests the shining dagger from his hand.
12943,ARGUMENT,"Deep in his throat he deals a deadly wound,"
12944,ARGUMENT,"And cries, ""Now, Trojan, take the wished-for land."
12945,ARGUMENT,"Lie there, and measure the Hesperian ground;"
12946,ARGUMENT,"Their meed, who tempt my sword; thus city-walls they found."""
12947,ARGUMENT,
12948,ARGUMENT,"XLVII. Asbutes, Sybaris and Chloreus bleed,"
12949,ARGUMENT,"Dares the bold, Orsilochus the brave,"
12950,ARGUMENT,"Thymoetes, pitched from off his plunging steed."
12951,ARGUMENT,"As on the AEgean when the North-winds rave,"
12952,ARGUMENT,"And the fierce gale rolls shoreward wave on wave,"
12953,ARGUMENT,And drives the cloud-rack through the sky; so these
12954,ARGUMENT,"Shrank back from Turnus, as his path he clave,"
12955,ARGUMENT,"Urged by his impulse, and each turns and flees;"
12956,ARGUMENT,"Loose streams his horsehair crest, blown backward by the breeze."
12957,ARGUMENT,
12958,ARGUMENT,"XLVIII. His fiery onset, and his shouts of pride"
12959,ARGUMENT,"Bold Phlegeus brooked not, but himself he flung"
12960,ARGUMENT,"Before the car, and caught and turned aside"
12961,ARGUMENT,"The foaming steeds. But while, thus dragged along,"
12962,ARGUMENT,"Grasping the bridle, on the yoke he hung,"
12963,ARGUMENT,"His shieldless side the broad-tipt javelin found,"
12964,ARGUMENT,"And pierced, and, staying, to the corslet clung,"
12965,ARGUMENT,With linen folds and brazen links twice bound.
12966,ARGUMENT,"And lightly scored the skin, and grazed him with the wound."
12967,ARGUMENT,
12968,ARGUMENT,"XLIX. His shield before him, at the foe he made,"
12969,ARGUMENT,"And drew his short sword, turning sharply round,"
12970,ARGUMENT,"And trusted to the naked steel for aid,"
12971,ARGUMENT,"When wheel and axle, urged with onward bound,"
12972,ARGUMENT,"Struck down and dashed him headlong to the ground,"
12973,ARGUMENT,"And Turnus, reaching forward, sword in hand,"
12974,ARGUMENT,Room 'twixt the hauberk and the helmet found
12975,ARGUMENT,"And lopped the head with his avenging brand,"
12976,ARGUMENT,And left the bleeding trunk to welter on the sand.
12977,ARGUMENT,
12978,ARGUMENT,"L.  While Turnus thus dealt havoc as he flew,"
12979,ARGUMENT,Back with AEneas from the combat went
12980,ARGUMENT,"Ascanius, Mnestheus, and Achates true,"
12981,ARGUMENT,And helped the bleeding hero to his tent.
12982,ARGUMENT,"Faltering and pale, as on the spear he leant,"
12983,ARGUMENT,"Fretting, and tugging at the shaft in vain,"
12984,ARGUMENT,"Quick help he summons,--with the broadsword's rent"
12985,ARGUMENT,"The wound to widen, and the lurking bane"
12986,ARGUMENT,"Cut out, and send him back to battle on the plain."
12987,ARGUMENT,
12988,ARGUMENT,"LI. Iapis, son of Iasus, was there,"
12989,ARGUMENT,The best-beloved of Phoebus. Long ago
12990,ARGUMENT,"Apollo, fired to see a youth so fair,"
12991,ARGUMENT,"His arts and gifts had offered to bestow,"
12992,ARGUMENT,"His augury, his lyre, his sounding bow."
12993,ARGUMENT,"But he, in hope a bed-rid parent's days"
12994,ARGUMENT,"To lengthen, sought the leech's craft to know,"
12995,ARGUMENT,"The power of simples, and the silent praise"
12996,ARGUMENT,"Of healing arts, and scorned the great Apollo's bays."
12997,ARGUMENT,
12998,ARGUMENT,"LII. Dark-frowning stands, still propt upon his spear,"
12999,ARGUMENT,"AEneas, heedless of his friends around"
13000,ARGUMENT,"And young Iulus, weeping in his fear."
13001,ARGUMENT,"Tight-girt like Paeon, with the robes upbound,"
13002,ARGUMENT,Beside him kneels the aged leech renowned.
13003,ARGUMENT,"With busy haste Apollo's salves he tries,"
13004,ARGUMENT,"In vain, in vain he coaxes in the wound"
13005,ARGUMENT,"The stubborn steel, the pincer's teeth he plies:"
13006,ARGUMENT,"Fate bides averse, his help the healing god denies;"
13007,ARGUMENT,
13008,ARGUMENT,"LIII. And more and more, along the echoing wold,"
13009,ARGUMENT,"The war's wild horror thickens on the ear,"
13010,ARGUMENT,"And storm-like, in the darkened skies uprolled,"
13011,ARGUMENT,The driving dust-clouds show the danger near.
13012,ARGUMENT,"Now horsemen, galloping in haste, appear,"
13013,ARGUMENT,"And darts and arrows, as the foe draw nigh,"
13014,ARGUMENT,"Fall in the tents, and fill the camp with fear,"
13015,ARGUMENT,"And a grim clamour mounts the vaulted sky,"
13016,ARGUMENT,"The shouts of those that fight, the groans of those that die."
13017,ARGUMENT,
13018,ARGUMENT,"LIV. Then, Venus, for her darling filled with grief,"
13019,ARGUMENT,A stalk of dittany on Ida's crown
13020,ARGUMENT,"Seeks out, and gathers, for his wound's relief,"
13021,ARGUMENT,The flower of purple and the leaves of down.
13022,ARGUMENT,(To wounded wild-goats 'twas a plant well-known)
13023,ARGUMENT,"This brings the Goddess, veiled in mist, and brews"
13024,ARGUMENT,"In a bright bowl a mixture of her own,"
13025,ARGUMENT,"And, steeped in water from the stream, she strews"
13026,ARGUMENT,"Soft balm of fragrant scent, and sweet ambrosial dews."
13027,ARGUMENT,
13028,ARGUMENT,"LV. Therewith the leech, unwitting, rinsed the wound,"
13029,ARGUMENT,"And the pain fled, and all the blood was stayed."
13030,ARGUMENT,"Out came the dart, and he again was sound."
13031,ARGUMENT,"""Arms! bring his arms! Why stand ye thus afraid?"""
13032,ARGUMENT,"Iapis cries, and, foremost to upbraid,"
13033,ARGUMENT,"Inflames them to the fight. ""No hand of mine,"
13034,ARGUMENT,"No power of leech-craft, nor a mortal's aid"
13035,ARGUMENT,"This healing wrought; a greater power divine,"
13036,ARGUMENT,"AEneas, sends thee back, by greater deeds to shine."""
13037,ARGUMENT,
13038,ARGUMENT,"LVI. He, hot for fight, the golden cuishes bound,"
13039,ARGUMENT,"And shook the spear, then put his corslet on,"
13040,ARGUMENT,"And strung the shield, and in his arms enwound,"
13041,ARGUMENT,And gently through the helmet kissed his son.
13042,ARGUMENT,"""Learn, boy, of me, how gallant deeds are done,"
13043,ARGUMENT,"Fortune of others. I will guard thee now,"
13044,ARGUMENT,And lead to fame. Let riper manhood con
13045,ARGUMENT,"Thy kinsmen's deeds. Remember, and be thou"
13046,ARGUMENT,"What uncle Hector was, and what thy sire is now."""
13047,ARGUMENT,
13048,ARGUMENT,"LVII. He spake, and swinging his tremendous spear,"
13049,ARGUMENT,"Swept through the gate; then Antheus, with his train,"
13050,ARGUMENT,"Rushed forth, and Mnestheus. With a general cheer"
13051,ARGUMENT,Forth pours the host; a dust-cloud hides the plain;
13052,ARGUMENT,"Earth, startled by their trampling, throbs in pain."
13053,ARGUMENT,"Pale Turnus saw them from a distant height,"
13054,ARGUMENT,"The Ausonians saw, and terror chilled each vein."
13055,ARGUMENT,"Juturna heard, and knew the noise of fight,"
13056,ARGUMENT,"And from the van drew back, and shuddered with affright."
13057,ARGUMENT,
13058,ARGUMENT,"LVIII. On swept he, and the blackening host behind."
13059,ARGUMENT,"As when from sea a storm-cloud sweeps to shore,"
13060,ARGUMENT,"The weather breaking, and the trembling hind"
13061,ARGUMENT,"Foresees afar the ruin and the roar,"
13062,ARGUMENT,"The shattered orchards, and the crops no more,"
13063,ARGUMENT,"While, landward borne, the muttering winds betray"
13064,ARGUMENT,The coming storm; so down the Trojan bore
13065,ARGUMENT,"Against the foemen, and in firm array"
13066,ARGUMENT,"All knit their serried ranks, and gladden at the fray."
13067,ARGUMENT,
13068,ARGUMENT,"LIX. Thymbraeus smites Osiris, Mnestheus fells"
13069,ARGUMENT,"Archetius; by Achates smitten sheer,"
13070,ARGUMENT,"Falls Epulo, and Gyas Ufens quells."
13071,ARGUMENT,"Falls, too, Tolumnius, the sacred seer,"
13072,ARGUMENT,Who first against the foemen hurled his spear.
13073,ARGUMENT,"Uprose a shout, and the Rutulians reeled"
13074,ARGUMENT,"And fled. AEneas, on the dusty rear"
13075,ARGUMENT,"Close-trampling, scorns to follow them afield,"
13076,ARGUMENT,"Or fight with those that stand, or slaughter those that yield."
13077,ARGUMENT,
13078,ARGUMENT,"LX. Turnus alone, amid the blinding gloom,"
13079,ARGUMENT,"He tracks and traces, searching far and near,"
13080,ARGUMENT,Turnus alone he summons to his doom.
13081,ARGUMENT,"Juturna sees, and smit with sudden fear,"
13082,ARGUMENT,"Unseats Metiscus, Turnus' charioteer,"
13083,ARGUMENT,"And flings him down, and leaves him on the plain,"
13084,ARGUMENT,"Then takes his place, and, urging their career,"
13085,ARGUMENT,Loose o'er the coursers shakes the waving rein;
13086,ARGUMENT,"Metiscus' voice and form, Metiscus' arms remain."
13087,ARGUMENT,
13088,ARGUMENT,"LXI. Like a black swallow, as she flies among"
13089,ARGUMENT,"A rich man's halls, or in the courts is found"
13090,ARGUMENT,In quest of dainties for her twittering young.
13091,ARGUMENT,"And now in empty cloisters, now around"
13092,ARGUMENT,"The fishpools circles, while the shrill notes sound."
13093,ARGUMENT,"So now Juturna, through the midmost foes,"
13094,ARGUMENT,"Whirled in the rapid chariot, scours the ground;"
13095,ARGUMENT,"Now here, now there triumphant Turnus shows,"
13096,ARGUMENT,"Now, flying, wheels aloof, nor suffers him to close."
13097,ARGUMENT,
13098,ARGUMENT,"LXII. So wheels in turn AEneas to and fro,"
13099,ARGUMENT,"And tracks his man, and through the war's wild tide"
13100,ARGUMENT,"Calls him aloud. Oft as he marks his foe,"
13101,ARGUMENT,"And, running, tries to match the coursers' stride,"
13102,ARGUMENT,So oft Juturna wheels the team aside.
13103,ARGUMENT,"What shall he do? While wavering thus in vain,"
13104,ARGUMENT,"As diverse thoughts his doubtful mind divide,"
13105,ARGUMENT,A steel-tipt dart Messapus--one of twain--
13106,ARGUMENT,"Aims true, and hurls it forth, uprunning on the plain."
13107,ARGUMENT,
13108,ARGUMENT,"LXIII. AEneas paused, behind his buckler bent."
13109,ARGUMENT,"On came the javelin, and the cone was shorn"
13110,ARGUMENT,"From off his helmet, and the plume was rent."
13111,ARGUMENT,"Foiled by this treachery, as he marked with scorn"
13112,ARGUMENT,"The steeds and chariot from the combat borne,"
13113,ARGUMENT,"He blazed with ire, and, calling on again"
13114,ARGUMENT,"Jove and the altars of the truce forsworn,"
13115,ARGUMENT,"Rushed on, thrice terrible, and o'er the plain"
13116,ARGUMENT,"Dealt indiscriminate death, and gave his wrath the rein."
13117,ARGUMENT,
13118,ARGUMENT,"LXIV. What heavenly muse can sing, what god can say"
13119,ARGUMENT,"The scenes of horror wrought on either side,"
13120,ARGUMENT,"The varied slaughter of that fatal day,"
13121,ARGUMENT,"What chiefs were chased along the field, and died,"
13122,ARGUMENT,"As Turnus now, and now the Trojan plied"
13123,ARGUMENT,"His murderous sword? Jove, could'st thou deem it right"
13124,ARGUMENT,"So dire a broil such peoples should divide,"
13125,ARGUMENT,"Two jarring nations met in deadly fight,"
13126,ARGUMENT,Whom leagues of lasting love were destined to unite?
13127,ARGUMENT,
13128,ARGUMENT,LXV. AEneas first (that fight 'twas first that stayed
13129,ARGUMENT,The Teucrian rout) caught Suero on the side.
13130,ARGUMENT,"Where death is quickest, 'twixt the ribs his blade,"
13131,ARGUMENT,"Deep in the framework of the breast, he plied."
13132,ARGUMENT,"Then Turnus slew Diores; close beside,"
13133,ARGUMENT,His brother Amycus from his steed he tore;
13134,ARGUMENT,"One by the spear, one by the sword-cut died."
13135,ARGUMENT,"Their severed heads the ruthless victor bore,"
13136,ARGUMENT,"Fixt to his flying car, and dripping with the gore."
13137,ARGUMENT,
13138,ARGUMENT,"LXVI. Talus, and Tanais, and Cethegus there"
13139,ARGUMENT,"AEneas smote, and poor Onytes slew,"
13140,ARGUMENT,Whom Peridia to Echion bare.
13141,ARGUMENT,Turnus two Lycian brethren next o'erthrew
13142,ARGUMENT,"From Phoebus' fields, and young Menoetes too"
13143,ARGUMENT,"From Arcady, who loathed the war in vain."
13144,ARGUMENT,"Poor was his home, nor rich men's doors he knew."
13145,ARGUMENT,"By fishful Lerna he had earned his gain,"
13146,ARGUMENT,Hired was the scanty glebe his father sowed with grain.
13147,ARGUMENT,
13148,ARGUMENT,"LXVII. Lo, as fierce flames drive in from left and right"
13149,ARGUMENT,"Through woodlands parched and groves of crackling bay,"
13150,ARGUMENT,As sweep impetuous from a mountain height
13151,ARGUMENT,"Loud, foaming torrents, that withouten stay"
13152,ARGUMENT,Cleave to the sea their devastating way:
13153,ARGUMENT,"So, while in each full tides of anger flow,"
13154,ARGUMENT,Rush Turnus and AEneas to the fray:
13155,ARGUMENT,"Their tameless breasts with bursting valour glow,"
13156,ARGUMENT,"On, on they speed amain, nor fear the opposing blow."
13157,ARGUMENT,
13158,ARGUMENT,"LXVIII. There stands Murranus, vaunting in vain joy"
13159,ARGUMENT,"His sires, and grandsires, he the princely son"
13160,ARGUMENT,Of Latin monarchs. Him the chief of Troy
13161,ARGUMENT,"Smites with the whirlwind of a monstrous stone,"
13162,ARGUMENT,"Huge as a rock. Down from his chariot thrown,"
13163,ARGUMENT,"'Twixt reins and yoke, he tumbles on the sward."
13164,ARGUMENT,"The fierce wheels, thundering onward, beat him down;"
13165,ARGUMENT,"His starting steeds, to shun the victor's sword,"
13166,ARGUMENT,"Tread on his trampled limbs, unmindful of their lord."
13167,ARGUMENT,
13168,ARGUMENT,"LXIX. Here, fronting Hyllus, as he rushed amain,"
13169,ARGUMENT,Fierce Turnus stood; his levelled spear-head clave
13170,ARGUMENT,"The golden casque, and quivered in his brain."
13171,ARGUMENT,"Nor thee, poor Creteus, though of Greeks most brave,"
13172,ARGUMENT,From Turnus had thy prowess power to save.
13173,ARGUMENT,Nor aught availed Cupencus' gods to aid
13174,ARGUMENT,"Against the dread AEneas, as he drave."
13175,ARGUMENT,"Squaring his breast, he met the glittering blade,"
13176,ARGUMENT,Nor long his brazen shield the mortal stroke delayed.
13177,ARGUMENT,
13178,ARGUMENT,"LXX. Thee, too, great AEolus, Laurentum's plain"
13179,ARGUMENT,"Saw trampled down by Turnus, as he flew,"
13180,ARGUMENT,And stretched at length among the Trojan slain.
13181,ARGUMENT,"Thou diest, whom ne'er could Argive bands subdue,"
13182,ARGUMENT,"Nor Peleus' son, who Priam's realm o'erthrew."
13183,ARGUMENT,"Thy goal is here; beyond the distant wave,"
13184,ARGUMENT,"Beneath the mount where Ida's fir-trees grew,"
13185,ARGUMENT,"High house was thine; high house Lyrnessus gave,"
13186,ARGUMENT,Thy home; Laurentum's soil hath given thee a grave.
13187,ARGUMENT,
13188,ARGUMENT,"LXXI. So met the ranks, and mingled, man with man,"
13189,ARGUMENT,"Latins and Dardans in promiscuous throng,"
13190,ARGUMENT,"Mnestheus and fierce Serestus in the van,"
13191,ARGUMENT,"Messapus, tamer of the steed, and strong"
13192,ARGUMENT,Asylas. There in tumult swept along
13193,ARGUMENT,"Arcadian horsemen, and the Tuscan train."
13194,ARGUMENT,"No rest is theirs, no respite; loud and long"
13195,ARGUMENT,"The conflict rages, as with might and main,"
13196,ARGUMENT,"Each for his own dear life, the warriors strive and strain."
13197,ARGUMENT,
13198,ARGUMENT,LXXII. Now lovely Venus doth her son persuade
13199,ARGUMENT,"To seek the walls, and townward turn his train,"
13200,ARGUMENT,And deal swift havoc on the foe dismayed.
13201,ARGUMENT,"While here and there AEneas scans the plain,"
13202,ARGUMENT,"Still tracking Turnus through the ranks in vain,"
13203,ARGUMENT,"Far off the peaceful city he espies,"
13204,ARGUMENT,"Unscathed, unstirred, and in his restless brain"
13205,ARGUMENT,The vision of a greater war doth rise;
13206,ARGUMENT,"Larger the War-God looms, and to his chiefs he cries."
13207,ARGUMENT,
13208,ARGUMENT,"LXXIII. Mnestheus, Sergestus and Serestus strong"
13209,ARGUMENT,"He calls, and on a hillock takes his stand."
13210,ARGUMENT,"There, mustering round him, all the Teucrians throng,"
13211,ARGUMENT,"Each armed with buckler, and his spear in hand,"
13212,ARGUMENT,And from the mound he thus exhorts the band:
13213,ARGUMENT,"""Hear, sons of Teucer, and let none be slack."
13214,ARGUMENT,"Jove fights for us, so hearken my command."
13215,ARGUMENT,"Though strange the venture, sudden the attack,"
13216,ARGUMENT,"Let none for that cause faint, none loiter and hang back."
13217,ARGUMENT,
13218,ARGUMENT,"LXXIV. ""This town--unless they yield them and obey--"
13219,ARGUMENT,"This town, the centre of Latinus' reign,"
13220,ARGUMENT,"The cause of war, will I uproot this day,"
13221,ARGUMENT,And raze her smoking roof-tops to the plain.
13222,ARGUMENT,"What! shall I wait, and wait, till Turnus deign"
13223,ARGUMENT,"To take fresh heart, and tempt the war's rough game,"
13224,ARGUMENT,"And, conquered, face his conqueror again?"
13225,ARGUMENT,See there the fount of all this blood! For shame;
13226,ARGUMENT,"Bring quick the torch; let fire the perjured pact reclaim!"""
13227,ARGUMENT,
13228,ARGUMENT,"LXXV. So spake he, and one purpose nerves them all."
13229,ARGUMENT,"They form a wedge, and forward with a cheer"
13230,ARGUMENT,The close-knit column charges at the wall.
13231,ARGUMENT,"Here scaling ladders in a trice they rear,"
13232,ARGUMENT,And firebrands suddenly and flames appear.
13233,ARGUMENT,"These seek the gates, and lay the foremost dead;"
13234,ARGUMENT,"Those flash the sword, or shake the shining spear."
13235,ARGUMENT,"Darts cloud the skies. AEneas, at their head,"
13236,ARGUMENT,"Stands by the lofty walls, and with his hands outspread,"
13237,ARGUMENT,
13238,ARGUMENT,"LXXVI. Upbraids aloud Latinus, twice untrue,"
13239,ARGUMENT,"And bids heaven witness and his wrongs regard,"
13240,ARGUMENT,Thus forced reluctant to the fight anew;
13241,ARGUMENT,"How loth again with Latin foes he warred,"
13242,ARGUMENT,How twice the truce the Latin crimes had marred.
13243,ARGUMENT,Upsprings wild discord in the town; some call
13244,ARGUMENT,"To cede the city, and have the gates unbarred,"
13245,ARGUMENT,And drag the aged monarch to the wall;
13246,ARGUMENT,"Some rush to arms, and strive their entrance to forestall."
13247,ARGUMENT,
13248,ARGUMENT,"LXXVII. As when within a crannied rock some hind,"
13249,ARGUMENT,"Returning home, a swarm of bees hath found,"
13250,ARGUMENT,And all the nest with bitter smoke doth blind:
13251,ARGUMENT,"They, in their waxen citadel fast bound,"
13252,ARGUMENT,"Post to and fro, the narrow cells around,"
13253,ARGUMENT,And whet their stings in fury and despair:
13254,ARGUMENT,"With stifled hum the caverned crags resound,"
13255,ARGUMENT,"The black fumes search the windings of their lair,"
13256,ARGUMENT,"And the dark smoke rolls up, and mingles with the air."
13257,ARGUMENT,
13258,ARGUMENT,LXXVIII. A new mischance now smote with further woe
13259,ARGUMENT,"The Latin town, and fainting hearts dismayed."
13260,ARGUMENT,"As queen Amata sees the coming foe,"
13261,ARGUMENT,"The ramparts stormed, their flames the roofs invade,"
13262,ARGUMENT,"And nowhere Turnus nor his troops to aid,"
13263,ARGUMENT,"Him dead she deems, herself the cause declares,"
13264,ARGUMENT,Herself alone she spares not to upbraid.
13265,ARGUMENT,"She wails,--she raves,--her purple robe she tears,"
13266,ARGUMENT,And from a lofty beam the hideous noose prepares.
13267,ARGUMENT,
13268,ARGUMENT,"LXXIX. The women heard; Lavinia first of all,"
13269,ARGUMENT,"Her golden locks, her rosy cheeks doth tear."
13270,ARGUMENT,"All rave around, and wailings fill the hall."
13271,ARGUMENT,"Fast flies the news, and shakes the town with fear."
13272,ARGUMENT,"Then rends his robes Latinus in despair,"
13273,ARGUMENT,"His town in ruins and his consort dead,"
13274,ARGUMENT,"And, scattering dust upon his hoary hair,"
13275,ARGUMENT,"Himself he blames, that ne'er in Turnus' stead"
13276,ARGUMENT,"The Dardan prince he chose, his dear-lov'd child to wed."
13277,ARGUMENT,
13278,ARGUMENT,"LXXX. Meanwhile, in chase of distant stragglers, speeds"
13279,ARGUMENT,"Fierce Turnus. Slacker is his car's career,"
13280,ARGUMENT,"And less he glories in his conquering steeds,"
13281,ARGUMENT,"When lo, the breezes from Laurentum bear"
13282,ARGUMENT,"The sound of shouting, and the shrieks of fear,"
13283,ARGUMENT,"And a dull murmur, as of men that groan,--"
13284,ARGUMENT,The city's roar--strikes on his listening ear.
13285,ARGUMENT,"""Ah me! what clamour on the winds is blown?"
13286,ARGUMENT,"What noise of grief,"" he cries, ""comes rolling from the town?"""
13287,ARGUMENT,
13288,ARGUMENT,"LXXXI. He spake, and madly pulled the rein. Then she,"
13289,ARGUMENT,"His sister, like Metiscus changed in view,"
13290,ARGUMENT,"Who ruled the chariot, ""Forward, Turnus! See"
13291,ARGUMENT,The path that victory points thee to pursue.
13292,ARGUMENT,This way--this way to chase the Trojan crew!
13293,ARGUMENT,"Others there are, who can the walls defend,"
13294,ARGUMENT,"See here AEneas, how he storms. We, too,"
13295,ARGUMENT,"Our foes, Troy's varlets, to their graves can send,"
13296,ARGUMENT,"Nor thee less tale of slain, nor scantier praise attend."""
13297,ARGUMENT,
13298,ARGUMENT,"LXXXII. Then quickly answered Turnus, glancing round,"
13299,ARGUMENT,"""Sister, long since I knew thee--knew thee plain,"
13300,ARGUMENT,"When first thy cunning did the league confound,"
13301,ARGUMENT,"And sent thee forth, fierce battle to darrain;"
13302,ARGUMENT,"And now thou think'st to cheat me, but in vain,"
13303,ARGUMENT,Albeit a goddess. But what power on high
13304,ARGUMENT,"Hath willed thee, sent from the Olympian reign,"
13305,ARGUMENT,"Such toils to suffer, and such tasks to try?"
13306,ARGUMENT,"Cam'st thou, forsooth, to see thy wretched brother die?"
13307,ARGUMENT,
13308,ARGUMENT,"LXXXIII. ""What can I do? What pledge of safety more"
13309,ARGUMENT,Doth Fortune give? what better hopes remain?
13310,ARGUMENT,"Myself beheld, these very eyes before,"
13311,ARGUMENT,"Murranus die, the dearest of our train,"
13312,ARGUMENT,Stretched by a huge wound hugely on the plain.

13347,ARGUMENT,
13348,ARGUMENT,LXXXVII. Stunned and bewildered by the changeful scene
13349,ARGUMENT,"Stood Turnus, gazing speechless and oppressed."
13350,ARGUMENT,"Shame, rage, and sorrow, and revengeful spleen,"
13351,ARGUMENT,"And frenzied love, and conscious worth confessed"

13359,ARGUMENT,"The tower, with bridge above and wheels below,"
13360,ARGUMENT,Himself with beams and mortised planks had raised.

13369,ARGUMENT,"Through foes, through darts, his sister left to mourn,"
13370,ARGUMENT,"Rushed headlong forth, and broke the ranks of war."
13371,ARGUMENT,"As when a boulder, from a hill-top borne,"

13374,ARGUMENT,"From crag to crag, leaps headlong, and in scorn"

13376,ARGUMENT,"Lays waste the woods, and whelms the shepherd and his sheep;"

13380,ARGUMENT,"Is soaked, and shrill with javelins shrieks the sky,"
13381,ARGUMENT,"Then shouts, with hand uplifted, to his train,"

13389,ARGUMENT,"Of Turnus, and his foeman's form espied,"
13390,ARGUMENT,"Down from the ramparts and the towers he came,"
13391,ARGUMENT,"And scorned delay, and put all else aside,"
13392,ARGUMENT,"Thundering in arms, and glorying in his pride."
13393,ARGUMENT,"As Athos huge, as Eryx huge he shows,"
13394,ARGUMENT,"Or huge as Father Apennine, whose side"
13395,ARGUMENT,"Roars with his nodding oaks, when drifted snows"
13396,ARGUMENT,"Shine on his joyous crest, and lighten on his brows."
13397,ARGUMENT,
13398,ARGUMENT,"XCII. Rutulians, Trojans, Latins,--each and all"
13399,ARGUMENT,"Look wondering on, both they who man the height,"
13400,ARGUMENT,And they who batter at the base. Down fall
13401,ARGUMENT,"Their arms. Amazed Latinus views the sight,"

13406,ARGUMENT,"Earth groans, and chance contends with courage for the day."
13407,ARGUMENT,
13408,ARGUMENT,"XCIII. As on Taburnus, or in Sila's shade"
13409,ARGUMENT,"Two bulls, with butting foreheads, mix in fray:"
13410,ARGUMENT,"Pale fly the hinds, mute stands the herd dismayed:"
13411,ARGUMENT,"The heifers low, unknowing who shall sway"

13414,ARGUMENT,"And thrust for thrust, and wound for wound repay,"
13415,ARGUMENT,"Fast from their necks and dewlaps streams the gore,"
13416,ARGUMENT,And all the neighbouring wood rebellows to the roar;

13418,ARGUMENT,"XCIV. So, when both champions on the listed field,"
13419,ARGUMENT,"The Trojan and the Daunian, eye to eye,"
13420,ARGUMENT,"Met in the deadly conflict, shield to shield"
13421,ARGUMENT,"Clanged, and a loud crash shattered through the sky."

13429,ARGUMENT,"Fierce Turnus, rising to his utmost height,"
13430,ARGUMENT,"And planting all his body in the blow,"
13431,ARGUMENT,"Strikes. A loud shout, of terror and delight"
13432,ARGUMENT,Goes up from Troy and Latium at the sight.
13433,ARGUMENT,"When lo, the falchion, as the stroke he plies,"
13434,ARGUMENT,"Snaps short, and leaves him helpless. Naught but flight"
13435,ARGUMENT,"Can aid him; swifter than the wind he flies,"
13436,ARGUMENT,As in his hand disarmed an unknown hilt he spies.
13437,ARGUMENT,
13438,ARGUMENT,"XCVI. When first his steeds were harnessed for the war,"
13439,ARGUMENT,"In haste he snatched Metiscus' sword, 'tis said,"
13440,ARGUMENT,"His sire's forgotten, as he climbed the car,"
13441,ARGUMENT,"And well enough that weapon served his stead,"
13442,ARGUMENT,"To smite the stragglers, while the Trojans fled;"
13443,ARGUMENT,"But when it met, and countered in the fray"
13444,ARGUMENT,"The arms of Vulcan, then the mortal blade,"
13445,ARGUMENT,"Found faithless, like the brittle ice, gave way,"
13446,ARGUMENT,And in the yellow sand the sparkling fragments lay.
13447,ARGUMENT,
13448,ARGUMENT,"XCVII. So Turnus flies, and, doubling, but in vain,"
13449,ARGUMENT,"Now here, now there, weaves many an aimless round;"
13450,ARGUMENT,"For all about him, as he scours the plain,"
13451,ARGUMENT,"The swarming legions of the foe are found,"
13452,ARGUMENT,"And here the marsh, and there the bulwarks bound."
13453,ARGUMENT,"Nor less AEneas, though his stiff knee feels"
13454,ARGUMENT,"The rankling arrow, and the hampering wound"
13455,ARGUMENT,"Retards his pace, pursues him, as he wheels,"
13456,ARGUMENT,"And dogs the flying foe, and presses on his heels."
13457,ARGUMENT,
13458,ARGUMENT,"XCVIII. As when some stag, a river in his face,"
13459,ARGUMENT,"Or toils with scarlet feathers, set to scare,"
13460,ARGUMENT,A huntsman with his braying hounds doth chase.
13461,ARGUMENT,"Awed by the steep bank and the threatening snare,"
13462,ARGUMENT,A thousand ways he doubles here and there;
13463,ARGUMENT,"But the keen Umbrian, all agape, is by,"
13464,ARGUMENT,"Now grasps,--now holds him,--and now thinks to tear,"
13465,ARGUMENT,And snaps his teeth on nothing; and a cry
13466,ARGUMENT,"Rings back from shore and stream, and rolls along the sky."
13467,ARGUMENT,
13468,ARGUMENT,"XCIX. Chiding by name his comrades, as he flies,"
13469,ARGUMENT,Fierce Turnus for his trusty sword doth cry.
13470,ARGUMENT,"Nor less AEneas with his threat defies,"
13471,ARGUMENT,"""Stand off,"" he shouts, ""who ventures to draw nigh,"
13472,ARGUMENT,"His town shall perish, and himself shall die."""
13473,ARGUMENT,"Onward, though maimed, he presses to his prey."
13474,ARGUMENT,Twice five times circling round the field they fly;
13475,ARGUMENT,"For no mean stake or sportive prize they play,"
13476,ARGUMENT,"Lo, Turnus' life and blood are wagered in the fray."
13477,ARGUMENT,
13478,ARGUMENT,"C.  A wilding olive on the sward had stood,"
13479,ARGUMENT,Sacred to Faunus. Mariners of yore
13480,ARGUMENT,"In worship held the venerable bough,"
13481,ARGUMENT,"When to Laurentum's guardian, safe on shore"
13482,ARGUMENT,Their votive raiment and their gifts they bore.
13483,ARGUMENT,"That sacred tree, the lists of fight to clear,"
13484,ARGUMENT,"Troy's sons had lopped. There, in the trunk's deep core,"
13485,ARGUMENT,"The Dardan javelin, urged with impulse sheer,"
13486,ARGUMENT,"Stuck fast; the stubborn root, retentive, grasped the spear."
13487,ARGUMENT,
13488,ARGUMENT,"CI. Stooping, AEneas with his hands essayed"
13489,ARGUMENT,"To pluck the steel, and follow with the spear"
13490,ARGUMENT,The foe his feet o'ertook not. Sore dismayed
13491,ARGUMENT,"Then Turnus cried, ""O Faunus, heed and hear,"
13492,ARGUMENT,"And thou, kind Earth, hold fast the steel, if dear"
13493,ARGUMENT,"I held the plant, which Trojan hands profaned."""
13494,ARGUMENT,"He prayed, nor Heaven refused a kindly ear."
13495,ARGUMENT,Long while AEneas at the tough root strained;
13496,ARGUMENT,Vain was his utmost strength; the biting shaft remained.
13497,ARGUMENT,
13498,ARGUMENT,"CII. While thus he stooped and struggled, prompt to aid,"
13499,ARGUMENT,"Juturna, to Metiscus changed anew,"
13500,ARGUMENT,"Ran forth, and to her brother reached his blade."
13501,ARGUMENT,"Then Venus, wroth the daring Nymph to view,"
13502,ARGUMENT,"Came, and the javelin from the stem withdrew,"
13503,ARGUMENT,"Thus, armed afresh, each eager for his chance,"
13504,ARGUMENT,"The Daunian trusting to his falchion true,"
13505,ARGUMENT,"The Dardan towering with uplifted lance,"
13506,ARGUMENT,"High-hearted, face to face, the breathless chiefs advance."
13507,ARGUMENT,
13508,ARGUMENT,"CIII. Then Jove, as from a saffron cloud above"
13509,ARGUMENT,"Looked Juno, pleased the doubtful strife to view,"
13510,ARGUMENT,"""When shall this end, sweet partner of my love?"
13511,ARGUMENT,"What more? Thou know'st it, and hast owned it too,"
13512,ARGUMENT,Divine AEneas to the skies is due.
13513,ARGUMENT,"What wilt thou, chill in cloudland? Was it right"
13514,ARGUMENT,A god with mortal weapons to pursue?
13515,ARGUMENT,Or give--for thine was all Juturna's might--
13516,ARGUMENT,"Lost Turnus back his sword, and renovate the fight?"
13517,ARGUMENT,
13518,ARGUMENT,"CIV. ""Desist at length, and hearken to my prayer."
13519,ARGUMENT,"Feed not in silence on a grief so sore,"
13520,ARGUMENT,Nor spoil those sweet lips with unlovely care.
13521,ARGUMENT,The end is come; 'twas thine on sea and shore
13522,ARGUMENT,"Troy's sons to vex, to wake the war's uproar,"
13523,ARGUMENT,"To cloud a home, a marriage-league untie,"
13524,ARGUMENT,"And mar with grief a bridal. Cease, and more"
13525,ARGUMENT,"Attempt not."" Thus the ruler of the sky,"
13526,ARGUMENT,"And thus, with down-cast look, Saturnia made reply."
13527,ARGUMENT,
13528,ARGUMENT,"CV. ""E'en so, great Jove, because thy will was known,"
13529,ARGUMENT,"I left, reluctant, Turnus and his land."
13530,ARGUMENT,"Else ne'er should'st thou behold me here alone,"
13531,ARGUMENT,"Thus shamed and suffering, but, torch in hand,"
13532,ARGUMENT,To smite these hateful Teucrians would I stand.
13533,ARGUMENT,I made Juturna rescue from the foe
13534,ARGUMENT,"Her hapless brother,--mine was the command,--"
13535,ARGUMENT,"Approved her daring for his sake, yet so"
13536,ARGUMENT,"As not to wield the spear, or meddle with the bow."

13538,ARGUMENT,"CVI. ""Nay, that I swear, and a dread oath will take"
13539,ARGUMENT,"(The only oath that doth the high gods bind),"
13540,ARGUMENT,By that grim fount that feeds the Stygian lake.
13541,ARGUMENT,"And now, great Jove, reluctant, but resigned,"
13542,ARGUMENT,"I yield, and leave the loathed fight behind."
13543,ARGUMENT,"One boon I ask, nor that in Fate's despite,"
13544,ARGUMENT,"For Latium, for the honour of thy kind."
13545,ARGUMENT,"When--be it so--blest Hymen's pact they plight,"
13546,ARGUMENT,"And laws and lasting league the warring folks unite,"

13551,ARGUMENT,Ne'er let Italia's children put away
13552,ARGUMENT,"The garb they wear, the language of to-day"
13553,ARGUMENT,"Let Latium flourish, and abide the same,"
13554,ARGUMENT,And Alban kings through distant ages sway.
13555,ARGUMENT,Let Rome through Latin prowess wax in fame;
13556,ARGUMENT,"But fall'n is Troy, and fall'n for ever be her name."""
13557,ARGUMENT,
13558,ARGUMENT,"CVIII. Smiling, the founder of the world replied:"

13561,ARGUMENT,Such floods of passion can thy breast contain?
13562,ARGUMENT,"But come, and from thy fruitless rage refrain."
13563,ARGUMENT,"I yield, and gladly; be thy will obeyed."
13564,ARGUMENT,"Speech, customs, name Ausonia shall retain"
13565,ARGUMENT,"Unchanged for ever, as thy lips have prayed."
13566,ARGUMENT,And in the Latin race Troy's mingled blood shall fade.

13574,ARGUMENT,"Thy praise, or pay such homage to thy shrine."""
13575,ARGUMENT,"Well-pleased was Juno, and assenting bowed,"
13576,ARGUMENT,And straight with altered mind ascended from the cloud.
13577,ARGUMENT,
13578,ARGUMENT,"CX. New schemes the Sire, from Turnus to repel"
13579,ARGUMENT,"Juturna's aid, now ponders in his mind."
13580,ARGUMENT,"Two fiends there are, called Furies. Night with fell"
13581,ARGUMENT,"Megaera bore them at one birth, and twined"
13582,ARGUMENT,"Their serpent spires, and winged them like the wind."
13583,ARGUMENT,"These at Jove's threshold, and beside his throne"

13587,ARGUMENT,
13588,ARGUMENT,"CXI. One, for an omen, from the skies he sends,"
13589,ARGUMENT,"To front Juturna. Down, with sudden spring,"
13590,ARGUMENT,"To earth, as in a whirlwind, she descends."
13591,ARGUMENT,As when a poisoned arrow from the string
13592,ARGUMENT,"Through clouds a Parthian launches on the wing,--"
13593,ARGUMENT,Parthian or Cretan--and in darkling flight
13594,ARGUMENT,"The shaft, with cureless venom in its sting,"
13595,ARGUMENT,"Screams through the shadows; so, arrayed in might,"
13596,ARGUMENT,Swift to the earth came down the daughter of the Night.
13597,ARGUMENT,
13598,ARGUMENT,"CXII. But when Troy's host and Turnus' ranks were known,"
13599,ARGUMENT,"Shrunk to the semblance of a bird in size,"
13600,ARGUMENT,Which oft on tombs or ruined roofs alone
13601,ARGUMENT,"Sits late at night, and with ill-omened cries"
13602,ARGUMENT,Vexes the darkness; so in dwarfed disguise
13603,ARGUMENT,"The foul fiend, shrieking around Turnus' head,"
13604,ARGUMENT,"Flaps on his shield, and flutters o'er his eyes."
13605,ARGUMENT,Strange torpor numbs the Daunian's limbs with dread;
13606,ARGUMENT,"The stiffening hair stands up, and all his voice is dead."
13607,ARGUMENT,
13608,ARGUMENT,"CXIII. The rustling wings Juturna knew, and tore"
13609,ARGUMENT,"Her comely face, and rent her scattered hair,"
13610,ARGUMENT,"And smote her breast: ""O cruel me! what more"
13611,ARGUMENT,For Turnus can a sister now? What care
13612,ARGUMENT,Or craft thy days can lengthen? Can I dare
13613,ARGUMENT,"To face this fiend? At last, at last I go,"
13614,ARGUMENT,"And quit the field. Foul birds, avaunt, nor scare"
13615,ARGUMENT,"My fluttering soul. Too well the sounds of woe,"
13616,ARGUMENT,"Those beating wings,--too well great Jove's behest I know."
13617,ARGUMENT,
13618,ARGUMENT,"CXIV. ""_This_ for my robbed virginity? Ah, why"

13629,ARGUMENT,"His tree-like spear he poises for the fray,"
13630,ARGUMENT,And pours the pent-up fury of his breast.
13631,ARGUMENT,"""Why stay'st thou, Turnus? Wherefore this delay?"
13632,ARGUMENT,"Fierce arms, not swiftness, must decide the day."
13633,ARGUMENT,"Shift as thou wilt, and every shape assume;"

13639,ARGUMENT,"""Ruffian! thy threats are but as empty sound;"
13640,ARGUMENT,"They daunt not Turnus; 'tis the gods I dread,"
13641,ARGUMENT,"And Jove my enemy."" Then, glancing round,"
13642,ARGUMENT,"He marked a chance-met boulder on the ground,"
13643,ARGUMENT,"Huge, grey with age, set there in ancient days"
13644,ARGUMENT,"To clear disputes,--a barrier and a bound."
13645,ARGUMENT,"Scarce twelve picked men the ponderous mass could raise,"
13646,ARGUMENT,Such men as Earth brings forth in these degenerate days.
13647,ARGUMENT,
13648,ARGUMENT,"CXVII. That stone the Daunian lifted, straining hard"
13649,ARGUMENT,"With hurrying hand, and all his height updrew,"
13650,ARGUMENT,And at AEneas hurled the monstrous shard;
13651,ARGUMENT,"So heaving, and so running, scarce he knew"
13652,ARGUMENT,"His running, or how huge a weight he threw."
13653,ARGUMENT,Cold froze his blood; beneath his trembling frame
13654,ARGUMENT,The weak knees tottered. Through the void air flew
13655,ARGUMENT,"The stone, nor all the middle space o'ercame,"
13656,ARGUMENT,"Short of its mark it fell, nor answered to its aim."
13657,ARGUMENT,
13658,ARGUMENT,"CXVIII. As oft in dreams, when drowsy night doth load"
13659,ARGUMENT,"The slumbering eyes, still eager, but in vain,"
13660,ARGUMENT,"We strive to race along a lengthening road,"
13661,ARGUMENT,"And faint and fall, amidmost of the strain;"
13662,ARGUMENT,"The feeble limbs their wonted aid disdain,"
13663,ARGUMENT,"Mute is the tongue, nor doth the voice obey,"
13664,ARGUMENT,Nor words find utterance; so with fruitless pain
13665,ARGUMENT,"Poor Turnus strives; but, struggle as he may,"
13666,ARGUMENT,"The baffling fiend is there, and mocks the vain essay."
13667,ARGUMENT,
13668,ARGUMENT,"CXIX. Then, tost with diverse passions, dazed with fear,"
13669,ARGUMENT,Towards friends and town he throws an anxious glance.
13670,ARGUMENT,"No car he sees, no sister-charioteer."
13671,ARGUMENT,"Desperate of flight, nor daring to advance,"
13672,ARGUMENT,"Aghast, and shuddering at the lifted lance,"
13673,ARGUMENT,He falters. Then AEneas poised at last
13674,ARGUMENT,"His spear, and hurled it, as he marked his chance."
13675,ARGUMENT,"Less loud the stone from battering engine cast,"
13676,ARGUMENT,Less loud through ether bursts the levin-bolt's dread blast.
13677,ARGUMENT,
13678,ARGUMENT,"CXX. Like a black whirlwind flew the deadly spear,"
13679,ARGUMENT,Right thro' the rim the sevenfold shield it rent
13680,ARGUMENT,"And breastplate's edge, nor stayed its onset ere"
13681,ARGUMENT,Deep in the thigh its hissing course was spent.
13682,ARGUMENT,"Down on the earth, his knees beneath him bent,"
13683,ARGUMENT,Great Turnus sank: Rutulia's host around
13684,ARGUMENT,Sprang up with wailing and with wild lament:
13685,ARGUMENT,"From neighbouring hills their piercing cries rebound,"
13686,ARGUMENT,And every wooded steep re-echoes to the sound.
13687,ARGUMENT,

14052,NOTES TO BOOK FIVE,LXXII. The meaning of this passage is very obscure. For we are not
14053,NOTES TO BOOK FIVE,told what the portent signified either in this or the succeeding
14054,NOTES TO BOOK FIVE,books. The old interpretation was that it referred to the burning
14055,NOTES TO BOOK FIVE,"of the ships (lxxxii. and following), but it is more probable that"
14056,NOTES TO BOOK FIVE,Virgil was thinking of the wars between Rome and Sicily.
14057,NOTES TO BOOK FIVE,
14058,NOTES TO BOOK FIVE,"LXXVII. The mother of Augustus was a member of the Atian family, and"

14079,NOTES TO BOOK SIX,I. _Cumae_ was the most ancient Greek colony in Campania. The
14080,NOTES TO BOOK SIX,tradition was that it had been founded by immigrants from Cyme and
14081,NOTES TO BOOK SIX,"Aeolis and from Chaleis in Euboea. Hence its name, and the epithet"
14082,NOTES TO BOOK SIX,Virgil applies to it.
14083,NOTES TO BOOK SIX,
14084,NOTES TO BOOK SIX,II. The 'Sibyl' here mentioned was the most famous of the

14099,NOTES TO BOOK SIX,"forced them to pay a yearly tribute of seven youths and seven maidens,"
14100,NOTES TO BOOK SIX,who were devoured by the Minotaur. This monster was the offspring
14101,NOTES TO BOOK SIX,"of Pasiphae, wife of Minos, and a bull sent by Neptune, and it lived"
14102,NOTES TO BOOK SIX,in the labyrinth built by Daedalus. The tribute continued to be paid
14103,NOTES TO BOOK SIX,"until Theseus, son of Aegeus, went to Crete as one of the seven."

14118,NOTES TO BOOK SIX,"XVIII. There was a volcanic lake near Cumae called _Avernus_, whose"
14119,NOTES TO BOOK SIX,waters gave out sulphureous vapours. It was connected by tradition

14121,NOTES TO BOOK SIX,"of the nether world by his harp-playing, that he was allowed to take"
14122,NOTES TO BOOK SIX,"back to the upper world his dead wife Eurydice. Castor was mortal,"
14123,NOTES TO BOOK SIX,but his brother Pollux was immortal; so when the former was slain
14124,NOTES TO BOOK SIX,in fight Pollux obtained from Jupiter permission that each should
14125,NOTES TO BOOK SIX,"spend half their time in heaven, half in Hades. Theseus descended"
14126,NOTES TO BOOK SIX,into Hades in order to carry off Proserpine. He was kept a prisoner

14186,NOTES TO BOOK SIX,born at Cures. Tullus and Ancus were the third and fourth kings of

14201,NOTES TO BOOK SIX,"CXII. L. Mummius captured Corinth, and so ended the war with Greece,"
14202,NOTES TO BOOK SIX,"in 146 B.C., and is clearly referred to here. By 'the man who lofty"
14203,NOTES TO BOOK SIX,"Argos shall o'erthrow,' Virgil probably means Aemilius Paullus, who"
14204,NOTES TO BOOK SIX,won the battle of Pydna in 168 B.C. against a king of Macedonia who
14205,NOTES TO BOOK SIX,called himself a descendant of Achilles.

14212,NOTES TO BOOK SIX,"Pyrrhus, when the latter invaded Italy in 281-75 B.C. Serranus was"
14213,NOTES TO BOOK SIX,a general in the first Punic war. The Fabii of renown are so many

14231,NOTES TO BOOK SEVEN,"Palinurus, mentioned in the last book. Caieta gave her name to the"

14233,NOTES TO BOOK SEVEN,Campania.
14234,NOTES TO BOOK SEVEN,

14238,NOTES TO BOOK SEVEN,
14239,NOTES TO BOOK SEVEN,"VI. 'Say, Erato:' Erato was the Muse of Love, and the invocation is"
14240,NOTES TO BOOK SEVEN,not specially appropriate in this place. But the line is an imitation

14246,NOTES TO BOOK SEVEN,"VII. _Latinus_ was king of the Latins, a small tribe whose chief town"
14247,NOTES TO BOOK SEVEN,"was Laurentum. _Faunus_ a god of the fields and cattle-keepers, was"
14248,NOTES TO BOOK SEVEN,afterwards identified with the Greek Pan. _Picus_ was a prophetic
14249,NOTES TO BOOK SEVEN,god. We are told by Ovid that he was changed into a woodpecker
14250,NOTES TO BOOK SEVEN,"(_picus_) by Circe, whose love he had slighted. _Saturnus_ was the"
14251,NOTES TO BOOK SEVEN,"old Latin god of sowing, and was later identified with the Greek"
14252,NOTES TO BOOK SEVEN,"Kronos, father of Zeus."
14253,NOTES TO BOOK SEVEN,
14254,NOTES TO BOOK SEVEN,XII. 'Albunea': apparently refers to a wooded hill with a sulphur
14255,NOTES TO BOOK SEVEN,spring. Probably it refers to a shrine near some sulphur springs at

14257,NOTES TO BOOK SEVEN,
14258,NOTES TO BOOK SEVEN,"'Oenotria': originally the southern part of Lucania and Bruttium,"

14264,NOTES TO BOOK SEVEN,"See Book VIII. stanza xxix. This, and other slight inconsistencies"
14265,NOTES TO BOOK SEVEN,in the _Aeneid_ are undoubtedly due to the fact that Virgil died
14266,NOTES TO BOOK SEVEN,before he had revised the poem.
14267,NOTES TO BOOK SEVEN,

14282,NOTES TO BOOK SEVEN,Lapithae until the latter were defeated. 'Diana's ire' was caused

14314,NOTES TO BOOK SEVEN,of the Claudian family.
14315,NOTES TO BOOK SEVEN,
14316,NOTES TO BOOK SEVEN,XCVI. The name of the Allia was ill-omened because it was on the banks

14326,NOTES TO BOOK SEVEN,having tempted her. Theseus in his wrath besought Poseidon to slay
14327,NOTES TO BOOK SEVEN,"his son, and the latter sent a monster from the sea, which terrified"

14603,B.C.,"Amyclae near Naples, but to the original Amyclae in Laconia, then"
14604,B.C.,the proverbial taciturnity of those inhabiting the latter country
14605,B.C.,offers sufficient explanation. _Aegeon_ was a monster with 100 arms
