2436,ÆNEAS HANGETH ARMOUR HERE FROM CONQUERING DANAANS WON.,They leave me in the Cyclops' den unmindful of their friend;
2437,ÆNEAS HANGETH ARMOUR HERE FROM CONQUERING DANAANS WON.,"A house of blood and bloody meat, most huge from end to end,"
2438,ÆNEAS HANGETH ARMOUR HERE FROM CONQUERING DANAANS WON.,Mirky within: high up aloft star-smiting to behold
2439,ÆNEAS HANGETH ARMOUR HERE FROM CONQUERING DANAANS WON.,"Is he himself;--such bane, O God, keep thou from field and fold!     620"
2440,ÆNEAS HANGETH ARMOUR HERE FROM CONQUERING DANAANS WON.,Scarce may a man look on his face; no word to him is good;
2441,ÆNEAS HANGETH ARMOUR HERE FROM CONQUERING DANAANS WON.,On wretches' entrails doth he feed and black abundant blood.
2442,ÆNEAS HANGETH ARMOUR HERE FROM CONQUERING DANAANS WON.,Myself I saw him of our folk two hapless bodies take

2653,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"""Most glorious praise ye carry off, meseems, most wealthy spoil,"
2654,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Thou and thy Boy; wondrous the might, and long to tell the toil,"
2655,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,Whereas two Gods by dint of craft one woman have o'erthrown.
2656,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"But well I wot, that through your fear of walls I call mine own,"
2657,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,In welcome of proud Carthage doors your hearts may never trow.
2658,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,But what shall be the end hereof? where wends our contest now?
2659,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"What if a peace that shall endure, and wedlock surely bound,          99"
2660,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,We fashion? That which all thine heart was set on thou hast found.
2661,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,For Dido burns: bone of her bone thy madness is today:
2662,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,So let us rule these folks as one beneath an equal sway:
2663,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Let the doom be that she shall take a Phrygian man for lord,"
2664,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"And to thine hand for dowry due her Tyrian folk award."""
2665,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,
2666,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"But Venus felt that Juno's guile within the word did live,"
2667,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Who lordship due to Italy to Libya fain would give,"
2668,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"So thus she answered her again: ""Who were so overbold"
2669,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"To gainsay this? or who would wish war against thee to hold,"
2670,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"If only this may come to pass, and fate the deed may seal?"
2671,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"But doubtful drifts my mind of fate, if one same town and weal       110"
2672,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Jove giveth to the Tyrian folk and those from Troy outcast,"
2673,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,If he will have those folks to blend and bind the treaty fast
2674,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,Thou art his wife: by prayer mayst thou prove all his purpose weighed.
2675,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Set forth, I follow."""
2676,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,Juno then took up the word and said:
2677,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"""Yea, that shall be my very work: how that which presseth now"
2678,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"May be encompassed, hearken ye, in few words will I show:"
2679,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,Æneas and the hapless queen are minded forth to fare
2680,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"For hunting to the thicket-side, when Titan first shall bear"
2681,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Tomorrow's light aloft, and all the glittering world unveil:"
2682,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"On them a darkening cloud of rain, blended with drift of hail,       120"
2683,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Will I pour down, while for the hunt the feathered snare-lines shake,"
2684,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,And toils about the thicket go: all heaven will I awake
2685,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"With thunder, and their scattered folk the mid-mirk shall enwrap:"
2686,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,Then Dido and the Trojan lord on one same cave shall hap;
2687,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"I will be there, and if to me thy heart be stable grown,"
2688,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,In wedlock will I join the two and deem her all his own:
2689,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"And there shall be their bridal God."""
2690,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Then Venus nought gainsaid,"
2691,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"But, nodding yea, she smiled upon the snare before her laid."
2692,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,
2693,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Meanwhile Aurora risen up had left the ocean stream,"
2694,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"And gateward throng the chosen youth in first of morning's beam,     130"
2695,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"And wide-meshed nets, and cordage-toils and broad-steeled spears abound,"
2696,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,Massylian riders go their ways with many a scenting hound.
2697,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,The lords of Carthage by the door bide till the tarrying queen
2698,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Shall leave her chamber: there, with gold and purple well beseen,"
2699,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"The mettled courser stands, and champs the bit that bids him bide."
2700,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,At last she cometh forth to them with many a man beside:
2701,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"A cloak of Sidon wrapped her round with pictured border wrought,"
2702,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Her quiver was of fashioned gold, and gold her tresses caught;"
2703,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,The gathering of her purple gown a golden buckle had.
2704,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,
2705,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,Then come the Phrygian fellows forth; comes forth Iulus glad;        140
2706,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Yea and Æneas' very self is of their fellowship,"
2707,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,And joins their band: in goodliness all those did he outstrip:
2708,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"E'en such as when Apollo leaves the wintry Lycian shore,"
2709,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"And Xanthus' stream, and Delos sees, his mother's isle once more;"
2710,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"And halloweth in the dance anew, while round the altars shout"
2711,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"The Cretans and the Dryopes, and painted Scythian rout:"
2712,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"He steps it o'er the Cynthus' ridge, and leafy crown to hold"
2713,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"His flowing tresses doth he weave, and intertwines the gold,"
2714,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,And on his shoulders clang the shafts. Nor duller now passed on
2715,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Æneas, from his noble face such wondrous glory shone.                150"
2716,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"So come they to the mountain-side and pathless deer-fed ground,"
2717,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"And lo, from hill-tops driven adown, how swift the wild goats bound"
2718,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,Along the ridges: otherwhere across the open lea
2719,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Run hart and hind, and gathering up their hornèd host to flee,"
2720,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,Amid a whirling cloud of dust they leave the mountain-sides.
2721,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"But here the boy Ascanius the midmost valley rides,"
2722,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"And glad, swift-horsed, now these he leaves, now those he flees before,"
2723,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"And fain were he mid deedless herds to meet a foaming boar,"
2724,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,Or see some yellow lion come the mountain-slopes adown.              159
2725,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,
2726,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Meanwhile with mighty murmuring sound confused the heavens are grown,"
2727,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,And thereupon the drift of rain and hail upon them broke;
2728,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Therewith the scattered Trojan youth, the Tyrian fellow-folk,"
2729,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"The son of Venus' Dardan son, scared through the meadows fly"
2730,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"To diverse shelter, while the streams rush from the mountains high."
2731,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,
2732,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,Then Dido and the Trojan lord meet in the self-same cave;
2733,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Then Earth, first-born of everything, and wedding Juno gave"
2734,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"The token; then the wildfires flashed, and air beheld them wed,"
2735,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,And o'er their bridal wailed the nymphs in hill-tops overhead.
2736,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,
2737,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,That day began the tide of death; that day the evil came;
2738,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,No more she heedeth eyes of men; no more she heedeth fame;           170
2739,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"No more hath Dido any thought a stolen love to win,"
2740,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"But calls it wedlock: yea, e'en so she weaveth up the sin."
2741,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,
2742,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,Straight through the mighty Libyan folks is Rumour on the wing--
2743,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Rumour, of whom nought swifter is of any evil thing:"
2744,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"She gathereth strength by going on, and bloometh shifting oft!"
2745,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"A little thing, afraid at first, she springeth soon aloft;"
2746,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Her feet are on the worldly soil, her head the clouds o'erlay."
2747,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Earth, spurred by anger 'gainst the Gods, begot her as they say,"
2748,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,Of Coeus and Enceladus the latest sister-birth.
2749,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Swift are her wings to cleave the air, swift-foot she treads the earth:  180"
2750,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"A monster dread and huge, on whom so many as there lie"
2751,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"The feathers, under each there lurks, O strange! a watchful eye;"
2752,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"And there wag tongues, and babble mouths, and hearkening ears upstand"
2753,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,As many: all a-dusk by night she flies 'twixt sky and land
2754,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Loud clattering, never shutting eye in rest of slumber sweet."
2755,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"By day she keepeth watch high-set on houses of the street,"
2756,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,Or on the towers aloft she sits for mighty cities' fear!
2757,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,And lies and ill she loves no less than sooth which she must bear.
2758,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,
2759,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"She now, rejoicing, filled the folk with babble many-voiced,"
2760,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,And matters true and false alike sang forth as she rejoiced:         190
2761,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"How here was come Æneas now, from Trojan blood sprung forth,"
2762,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,Whom beauteous Dido deemed indeed a man to mate her worth:
2763,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"How winter-long betwixt them there the sweets of sloth they nursed,"
2764,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Unmindful of their kingdoms' weal, by ill desire accursed."
2765,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"This in the mouth of every man the loathly Goddess lays,"
2766,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"And thence to King Iarbas straight she wendeth on her ways,"
2767,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"To set his mind on fire with words, and high his wrath to lead."
2768,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,
2769,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"He, sprung from Garamantian nymph and very Ammon's seed,"
2770,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"An hundred mighty fanes to Jove, an hundred altars fair,"
2771,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Had builded in his wide domain, and set the watch-fire there,        200"
2772,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,The everlasting guard of God: there fat the soil was grown
2773,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,With blood of beasts; the threshold bloomed with garlands diverse blown.
2774,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"He, saith the tale, all mad at heart, and fired with bitter fame,"
2775,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Amidmost of the might of God before the altars came,"
2776,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,And prayed a many things to Jove with suppliant hands outspread:

2781,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"When thou art thundering? Yea, forsooth, a blind fire of the clouds,"
2782,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"An idle hubbub of the sky, our souls with terror loads!              210"
2783,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"A woman wandering on our shore, who set her up e'en now"
2784,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"A little money-cheapened town, to whom a field to plough"
2785,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"And lordship of the place we gave, hath thrust away my word"
2786,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Of wedlock, and hath taken in Æneas for her lord:"
2787,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"And now this Paris, hedged around with all his gelding rout,"
2788,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Mæonian mitre tied to chin, and wet hair done about,"
2789,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Sits on the prey while to thine house a many gifts we bear,"

2792,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"The Almighty heard him as he prayed holding the altar-horns,"
2793,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"And to the war-walls of the Queen his eyes therewith he turns,       220"
2794,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,And sees the lovers heeding nought the glory of their lives;
2795,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Then Mercury he calls to him, and such a bidding gives:"
2796,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"""Go forth, O Son, the Zephyrs call, and glide upon the wing"

2799,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Speak to him, Son, and bear my words down the swift air of heaven:"
2800,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"His fairest mother promised us no such a man at need,"
2801,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,Nor claimed him twice from Greekish sword to live for such a deed.
2802,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"But Italy, the fierce in war, the big with empire's brood,"
2803,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,Was he to rule; to get for us from glorious Teucer's blood           230
2804,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"That folk of folks, and all the world beneath his laws to lay."
2805,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"But if such glory of great deeds nought stirreth him today,"
2806,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Nor for his own fame hath he heart the toil to overcome,"
2807,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,Yet shall the father grudge the son the towered heights of Rome?
2808,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,What doth he? tarrying for what hope among the enemy?
2809,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"And hath no eyes Ausonian sons, Lavinian land to see?"
2810,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Let him to ship! this is the doom; this word I bid thee bear."""
2811,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,
2812,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,He spake: his mighty father's will straight did the God prepare
2813,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"To compass, and his golden shoes first bindeth on his feet,"
2814,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"E'en those which o'er the ocean plain aloft on feathers fleet,       240"

2818,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"And giveth sleep and takes away, and openeth eyes to death;"
2819,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,The rod that sways the ocean-winds and rules the cloudy rack.
2820,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,Now winging way he comes in sight of peak and steepy back
2821,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Of flinty Atlas, on whose head all heaven is set adown--"
2822,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Of Atlas with the piny head, and never-failing crown"

2826,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"There hovering on his poisèd wings stayed that Cyllenian one,"
2827,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,And all his gathered body thence sent headlong toward the waves;
2828,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Then like a bird the shores about, about the fishy caves,"
2829,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Skims low adown upon the wing the sea-plain's face anigh,"
2830,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,Not otherwise 'twixt heaven and earth Cyllene's God did fly;
2831,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"And now, his mother's father great a long way left behind,"
2832,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,Unto the sandy Libya's shore he clave the driving wind.
2833,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"But when the cot-built place of earth he felt beneath his feet,"
2834,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,He saw Æneas founding towers and raising houses meet:                260
2835,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Starred was the sword about him girt with yellow jasper stone,"
2836,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,The cloak that from his shoulders streamed with Tyrian purple shone:
2837,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Fair things that wealthy Dido's hand had given him for a gift,"
2838,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,Who with the gleam of thready gold the purple web did shift.
2839,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,
2840,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Then brake the God on him: ""Forsooth, tall Carthage wilt thou found,"

2843,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,The very ruler of the Gods down from Olympus bright
2844,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Hath sent me, he whose majesty the earth and heavens obey;"
2845,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,This was the word he bade me bear adown the windy way.               270
2846,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,What dost thou? hoping for what hope in Libya dost thou wear
2847,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Thy days? if glorious fated things thine own soul may not stir,"
2848,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"And heart thou lackest for thy fame the coming toil to wed,"
2849,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Think on Ascanius' dawn of days and hope inherited,"
2850,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"To whom is due the Italian realm and all the world of Rome!"""
2851,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,
2852,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"But when from out Cyllenius' mouth such word as this had come,"
2853,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Amidst his speech he left the sight of men that die from day,"
2854,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,And mid thin air from eyes of folk he faded far away.
2855,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"But sore the sight Æneas feared, and wit from out him drave;"
2856,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"His hair stood up, amidst his jaws the voice within him clave.       280"
2857,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Bewildered by that warning word, and by that God's command,"
2858,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"He yearneth to depart and flee, and leave the lovely land."
2859,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Ah, what to do? and with what word may he be bold to win"
2860,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,Peace of the Queen all mad with love? what wise shall he begin?
2861,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Hither and thither now he sends his mind all eager-swift,"
2862,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,And bears it diversely away and runs o'er every shift:
2863,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"At last, as many things he weighed, this seemed the better rede."
2864,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Mnestheus, Sergestus, straight he calls, Sergestus stout at need,"
2865,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"And bids them dight ship silently and bring their folk to shore,"
2866,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"And dight their gear, and cause thereof with lying cover o'er;       290"
2867,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"While he himself, since of all this kind Dido knoweth nought,"
2868,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Nor of the ending of such love may ever have a thought,"
2869,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Will seek to draw anigh the Queen, seek time wherein the word"

2871,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"So all they glad his bidding do, and get them to the work."
2872,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,
2873,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,But who may hoodwink loving eyes? She felt the treason lurk
2874,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"About her life, and from the first saw all that was to be;"
2875,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,Fearing indeed where no fear was. That Rumour wickedly
2876,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,Told her wild soul of ship-host armed and ready to set out;
2877,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"The heart died in her; all aflame she raves the town about,          300"

2881,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,
2882,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,Unto Æneas at the last herself she speaketh thus:
2883,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"""O thou forsworn! and hast thou hoped with lies to cover o'er"
2884,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Such wickedness, and silently to get thee from my shore?"
2885,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Our love, it hath not held thee back? nor right hand given in faith"

2891,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,Wouldst thou not still be seeking Troy across the wavy brine?
2892,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"--Yea, me thou fleest. O by these tears, by that right hand of thine,"
2893,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Since I myself have left myself unhappy nought but this,"
2894,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"And by our bridal of that day and early wedding bliss,"
2895,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"If ever I were worthy thanks, if sweet in aught I were,"
2896,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,"Pity a falling house! If yet be left a space for prayer,"
2897,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,O then I pray thee put away this mind of evil things!

2917,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,Few words about the deed in hand: ne'er in my mind it came

2949,WOEFUL ENDING OF HER.,Why hide it now? why hold me back lest greater evil be?

6183,ÆNEAS.,"His vanquished House-Gods, calling him the Fate-ordainèd King;"
6184,ÆNEAS.,"How many a folk of Italy hath joined the Dardan lord,"
6185,ÆNEAS.,How that his name in Latin land is grown a mighty word--

6187,ÆNEAS.,If Fortune aid him he shall turn--through this thou see'st more light
6188,ÆNEAS.,Than cometh to King Turnus yet or King Latinus eyes.
6189,ÆNEAS.,
6190,ÆNEAS.,"So goes the world in Latium now, and noting how all lies,"
6191,ÆNEAS.,"The Trojan hero drifts adown a mighty tide of care,"
6192,ÆNEAS.,"And hither now his swift thought speeds, now thither bids it fare,    20"
6193,ÆNEAS.,And sends it diversely about by every way to slip:
6194,ÆNEAS.,"As quivering light of water is in brazen vessel's lip,"
6195,ÆNEAS.,"Smit by the sun, or casting back the image of the moon."
6196,ÆNEAS.,"It flitteth all about the place, and rising upward soon"

6204,ÆNEAS.,"When lo, between the poplar-leaves the godhead of the place,"
6205,ÆNEAS.,"E'en Tiber of the lovely stream, arose before his face,"
6206,ÆNEAS.,"A veil of linen grey and thin the elder's body clad,"
6207,ÆNEAS.,And garlanding of shady sedge the tresses of him had;
6208,ÆNEAS.,And thus Æneas he bespeaks to take away his woe:
6209,ÆNEAS.,
6210,ÆNEAS.,"""O Seed of Gods, who bearest us Troy-town from midst the foe,"
6211,ÆNEAS.,"Who savest Pergamus new-born no more to die again,"
6212,ÆNEAS.,Long looked-for on Laurentine earth and fields of Latin men;
6213,ÆNEAS.,"This is your sure abiding-place, your House-Gods' very stead;"
6214,ÆNEAS.,"Turn not, nor fear the battle-threats, for now hath fallen dead       40"
6215,ÆNEAS.,The swelling storm of godhead's wrath.
6216,ÆNEAS.,"And lest thou think I forge for thee an idle dream of sleep,"
6217,ÆNEAS.,"Amid the holm-oaks of the shore a great sow shalt thou see,"
6218,ÆNEAS.,Who e'en now farrowed thirty head of young; there lieth she
6219,ÆNEAS.,"All white along, with piglings white around her uddered sides:"
6220,ÆNEAS.,That earth shall be thy dwelling-place; there rest from toil abides.
6221,ÆNEAS.,"From thence Ascanius, when the year hath thrice ten times rolled round,"
6222,ÆNEAS.,"Shall raise a city, calling it by Alba's name renowned."
6223,ÆNEAS.,"No doubtful matters do I sing,--but how to speed thee well,"
6224,ÆNEAS.,"And win thee victor from all this, in few words will I tell:          50"
6225,ÆNEAS.,"Arcadian people while agone, a folk from Pallas come,"
6226,ÆNEAS.,"Following Evander for their king, have borne his banners home,"
6227,ÆNEAS.,"And chosen earth, and reared their town amid a mountain place"
6228,ÆNEAS.,"E'en Pallanteum named, from him who first began their race:"
6229,ÆNEAS.,"This folk against the Latin men for ever wages fight,"
6230,ÆNEAS.,"Bid them as fellows to thy camp, and treaty with them plight;"
6231,ÆNEAS.,"But I by bank and flow of flood will straightly lead thee there,"
6232,ÆNEAS.,While thou with beating of the oars the stream dost overbear.
6233,ÆNEAS.,"Arise, arise, O Goddess-born, when the first star-world sets,"
6234,ÆNEAS.,Make prayer to Juno in due wise; o'ercome her wrath and threats       60
6235,ÆNEAS.,"With suppliant vows: victorious grown, thou yet shalt worship me;"
6236,ÆNEAS.,For I am that abundant flood whom thou today dost see
6237,ÆNEAS.,"Sweeping the bank and cleaving way amid the plenteous earth,"
6238,ÆNEAS.,"Blue Tiber, sweetest unto heaven of all the streams of worth."
6239,ÆNEAS.,"This is my mighty house; my head from lofty cities sweeps."""
6240,ÆNEAS.,
6241,ÆNEAS.,"The River spake, and hid himself amid the watery deeps;"
6242,ÆNEAS.,But night and slumber therewithal Æneas' eyes forsook;
6243,ÆNEAS.,"He rose and toward the dawning-place and lights of heaven 'gan look,"
6244,ÆNEAS.,And duly in his hollow hand he lifted water fair                      69
6245,ÆNEAS.,"From out the stream, and unto heaven in such wise poured his prayer:"
6246,ÆNEAS.,
6247,ÆNEAS.,"""O Nymphs, Laurentian Nymphs, from whence the race of rivers springs,"
6248,ÆNEAS.,"And thou, O father Tiber fair, with holy wanderings,"
6249,ÆNEAS.,"Cherish Æneas; thrust from me the bitter following bane,"
6250,ÆNEAS.,"What pool soe'er may nurse thy spring, O pityer of my pain,"
6251,ÆNEAS.,"From whatso land, O loveliest, thy stream may issue forth."
6252,ÆNEAS.,"For ever will I give thee gifts, and worship well thy worth,"
6253,ÆNEAS.,"Horned river, of all Westland streams the very king and lord;"
6254,ÆNEAS.,"Only be with me; faster bind thy great God-uttered word."""
6255,ÆNEAS.,
6256,ÆNEAS.,"Thus having said, two twi-banked keels he chooseth from the fleet,"
6257,ÆNEAS.,And mans the oars and dights his folk with gear and weapons meet.     80
6258,ÆNEAS.,
6259,ÆNEAS.,But lo meanwhile a wondrous sign is thrust before his eyes;
6260,ÆNEAS.,For on the green-sward of the wood a snow-white sow there lies
6261,ÆNEAS.,"Down by the strand, her little ones, like-hued, about her pressed;"
6262,ÆNEAS.,"Whom god-loving Æneas slays to thee, O mightiest,"
6263,ÆNEAS.,"O Juno, at thine altar-fires hallowing both dam and brood."
6264,ÆNEAS.,
6265,ÆNEAS.,"Now while the long night wore away, the swelling of his flood"
6266,ÆNEAS.,"Had Tiber soothed, and eddying back in peace the stream was stayed,"
6267,ÆNEAS.,"And in the manner of a mere the water's face was laid,"
6268,ÆNEAS.,"Or as a pool, that so the oars unstrained their work may ply."
6269,ÆNEAS.,So now they speed their journey forth amid a happy cry;               90
6270,ÆNEAS.,"The oiled fir slips along the seas, the waves fall wondering then,--"
6271,ÆNEAS.,"The woods, unused, fall wondering sore to see the shields of men"
6272,ÆNEAS.,Shine far up stream; to see the keels bepainted swimming there:
6273,ÆNEAS.,"But day and night, with beat of oars, the watery way they wear,"
6274,ÆNEAS.,"And conquer reaches long, o'erlaid with many a shifting tree,"
6275,ÆNEAS.,And cleave the forest fair and green along the waveless sea.
6276,ÆNEAS.,
6277,ÆNEAS.,"Unto the midmost crown of heaven had climbed the fiery sun,"
6278,ÆNEAS.,"By then the walls, and far-off burg, and few roofs one by one"
6279,ÆNEAS.,"They see; the place raised high as heaven by mightiness of Rome,"
6280,ÆNEAS.,"Where in those days Evander had an unrich, scanty home:              100"
6281,ÆNEAS.,"So thither swift they turned their prows, and toward the city drew."
6282,ÆNEAS.,
6283,ÆNEAS.,That day it chanced the Arcadian King did yearly honour do
6284,ÆNEAS.,"Unto Amphitryon's mighty son, and on the God did call"
6285,ÆNEAS.,"In grove before the city-walls: Pallas, his son, withal,"
6286,ÆNEAS.,"The battle-lords, the senate poor of that unwealthy folk"
6287,ÆNEAS.,Cast incense there; with yet warm blood the altars were a-smoke.
6288,ÆNEAS.,But when they saw the tall ships glide amidst the dusky shade
6289,ÆNEAS.,"Of woody banks, and might of men on oars all silent laid,"
6290,ÆNEAS.,"Scared at the sudden sight they rise, and all the boards forsake:"
6291,ÆNEAS.,"But Pallas, of the hardy heart, forbids the feast to break,          110"
6292,ÆNEAS.,"While he, with weapon caught in haste, flies forth to meet the men,"
6293,ÆNEAS.,And crieth from a mound afar:
6294,ÆNEAS.,"""Fellows, what drave you then?"
6295,ÆNEAS.,And whither wend ye on your ways by road untried before?
6296,ÆNEAS.,"What folk and from what home are ye? and is it peace or war?"""
6297,ÆNEAS.,
6298,ÆNEAS.,"Then spake the father Æneas the lofty deck aboard,"
6299,ÆNEAS.,As with the peaceful olive-bough he reached his hand abroad;
6300,ÆNEAS.,"""Troy's folk ye see and weapons whet against the Latin side,"
6301,ÆNEAS.,Whom they have driven forth by war amid their plenteous pride.
6302,ÆNEAS.,"We seek Evander: go ye forth and tell him this, and say"
6303,ÆNEAS.,"That chosen dukes of Troy are come for plighted troth to pray.""      120"
6304,ÆNEAS.,
6305,ÆNEAS.,The sound of such a mighty name smote Pallas with amaze:
6306,ÆNEAS.,"""Come forth,"" he said, ""whoso ye be: before my father's face"
6307,ÆNEAS.,"Say what ye would; come to our Gods and in our house be guest."""
6308,ÆNEAS.,
6309,ÆNEAS.,"So saying he gave his hand to him, and hard his right hand pressed;"
6310,ÆNEAS.,"Therewith they leave the river-bank, and wend amidst the wood:"
6311,ÆNEAS.,But spake Æneas to the king fair friendly words and good:
6312,ÆNEAS.,
6313,ÆNEAS.,"""O best of Greeks, whom fortune wills that I should now beseech,"
6314,ÆNEAS.,"And unto thee the suppliant staff of olive garlands reach,"
6315,ÆNEAS.,"I feared thee not for Arcas' seed or Duke of Danai,"
6316,ÆNEAS.,Nor for thy being to Atreus' twins a kinsman born anigh:             130
6317,ÆNEAS.,"Rather my heart, and holy words that Gods have given forth,"
6318,ÆNEAS.,"Our fathers' kin, the world-wide tale that goeth of thy worth,"
6319,ÆNEAS.,"Bind me to thee, and make me fain of what Fate bids befall."
6320,ÆNEAS.,"Now Dardanus, first setter-up and sire of Ilian wall,"
6321,ÆNEAS.,"Born of Electra, Atlas' child, as Greekish stories say,"
6322,ÆNEAS.,"Came to the Teucrians: Atlas huge Electra gave today,"
6323,ÆNEAS.,"Atlas, who on his shoulders rears the round-wrought heavenly house:"
6324,ÆNEAS.,"But Mercury thy father is, whom Maia glorious"
6325,ÆNEAS.,"Conceived, and shed on earth one day on high Cyllene cold;"
6326,ÆNEAS.,"But Atlas Maia too begot, if we may trow tale told,                  140"
6327,ÆNEAS.,"That very Atlas who the stars of heavenly house doth raise,"
6328,ÆNEAS.,So from one root the race of us wends on its twofold ways.
6329,ÆNEAS.,"Stayed by these things none else I sent, nor guilefully have sought,"
6330,ÆNEAS.,"Assaying of thee, but myself unto thyself I brought,"
6331,ÆNEAS.,And mine own head; and here I stand a suppliant at thy door.
6332,ÆNEAS.,And that same Daunian folk of men drive us with bitter war
6333,ÆNEAS.,"As fall on thee: if us they chase, what stay but utterly,"
6334,ÆNEAS.,"(So deem they) all the Westland earth beneath their yoke shall lie,"
6335,ÆNEAS.,"With all the upper flood of sea, and nether waters' wash."
6336,ÆNEAS.,"Take troth and give it: hearts are we stout in the battle's clash,   150"
6337,ÆNEAS.,"High-counselled souls, men well beheld in deeds that try the man."""
6338,ÆNEAS.,
6339,ÆNEAS.,He ended: but Evander's look this long while overran
6340,ÆNEAS.,"His face, his speaking eyes, and all his body fair to see;"
6341,ÆNEAS.,Then in few words he answered thus:
6342,ÆNEAS.,"""How sweet to welcome thee,"
6343,ÆNEAS.,"Best heart of Troy! and how I mind the words, and seem to hear"
6344,ÆNEAS.,"Anchises' voice, and see the face that mighty man did bear:"
6345,ÆNEAS.,"For I remember Priam erst, child of Laomedon,"
6346,ÆNEAS.,"Came to Hesione's abode, to Salamis passed on,"
6347,ÆNEAS.,And thence would wend his ways to seek Arcadia's chilly place.
6348,ÆNEAS.,"The blossom of the spring of life then bloomed upon my face,         160"
6349,ÆNEAS.,When on the Teucrian lords I looked with joy and wonderment;
6350,ÆNEAS.,"On Priam, too: but loftier there than any other went"
6351,ÆNEAS.,Anchises; and his sight in me struck youthful love awake.
6352,ÆNEAS.,"I yearned to speak unto the man, and hand in hand to take:"
6353,ÆNEAS.,"So fain I met him, led him in to Phineus' wallèd place;"
6354,ÆNEAS.,"And he, departing, gave to me a noble arrow-case"
6355,ÆNEAS.,"And Lycian shafts; a cloak thereto, all shot across with gold,"
6356,ÆNEAS.,"And golden bridles twain, that now Pallas, my son, doth hold."
6357,ÆNEAS.,"Lo, then, the right hand that ye sought is joined in troth to thine;"
6358,ÆNEAS.,"And when tomorrow's light once more upon the world shall shine,      170"
6359,ÆNEAS.,"Glad, holpen, shall I send you forth and stay you with my store."
6360,ÆNEAS.,"Meanwhile, since here ye come our friends, with us the Gods adore"
6361,ÆNEAS.,"At this our hallowed yearly feast, which ill it were to stay:"
6362,ÆNEAS.,"Be kind, and with your fellows' boards make friends without delay."""
6363,ÆNEAS.,
6364,ÆNEAS.,"Therewith he bids bring forth once more the wine-cups and the meat,"
6365,ÆNEAS.,And he himself sets down the men upon a grassy seat;
6366,ÆNEAS.,But chiefly to the bed bedight with shaggy lion's skin
6367,ÆNEAS.,"He draws Æneas, bidding him the throne of maple win."
6368,ÆNEAS.,"Then vie the chosen youth-at-arms, the altar-priest brings aid;"
6369,ÆNEAS.,"They bear in roasted flesh of bulls, and high the baskets lade       180"
6370,ÆNEAS.,"With gifts of Ceres fashioned well, and serve the Bacchus' joy;"
6371,ÆNEAS.,So therewithal Æneas eats and men-at-arms of Troy
6372,ÆNEAS.,Of undivided oxen chines and inwards of the feast.
6373,ÆNEAS.,"But when the lust of meat was dulled and hunger's gnawing ceased,"
6374,ÆNEAS.,Saith King Evander:
6375,ÆNEAS.,"""This high-tide that we are holding thus,"
6376,ÆNEAS.,"This ordered feast, this altar raised to God all-glorious,"
6377,ÆNEAS.,"No idle task of witch-work is, that knoweth not the Gods"
6378,ÆNEAS.,"Of ancient days: O Trojan chief, we, saved from fearful odds,"
6379,ÆNEAS.,"Here worship, and give glory new to deeds done gloriously."
6380,ÆNEAS.,"Note first the crag, whose world of stones o'ertoppleth there anigh;  190"
6381,ÆNEAS.,"What stone-heaps have been cast afar, how waste and wild is grown"
6382,ÆNEAS.,"The mountain-house, what mighty wrack the rocks have dragged adown."
6383,ÆNEAS.,"Therein a cave was erst, that back a long way burrowing ran,"
6384,ÆNEAS.,"Held by the dreadful thing, the shape of Cacus, monster-man."
6385,ÆNEAS.,"A place the sun might never see, for ever warm and wet"
6386,ÆNEAS.,With reek of murder newly wrought; o'er whose proud doorways set
6387,ÆNEAS.,The heads of men were hanging still wan mid the woeful gore.
6388,ÆNEAS.,Vulcan was father of this fiend; his black flame did he pour
6389,ÆNEAS.,"Forth from his mouth, as monster-great he wended on his ways."
6390,ÆNEAS.,"But to our aid, as whiles it will, brought round the lapse of days   200"
6391,ÆNEAS.,"The help and coming of a God: for that most mighty one,"
6392,ÆNEAS.,"All glorious with the death and spoils of threefold Geryon,"
6393,ÆNEAS.,"Alcides, our avenger came, driving the victor's meed,"
6394,ÆNEAS.,"His mighty bulls, who down the dale and river-bank did feed."
6395,ÆNEAS.,"But Cacus, mad with furious heart, that nought undared might be"
6396,ÆNEAS.,"Of evil deeds, or nought untried of guile and treachery,"
6397,ÆNEAS.,"Drave from the fold four head of bulls of bodies excellent,"
6398,ÆNEAS.,"And e'en so many lovely kine, whose fashion all outwent;"
6399,ÆNEAS.,"Which same, that of their rightful road the footprints clean might lack,"
6400,ÆNEAS.,"Tail-foremost dragged he to his den, turning their way-marks back;   210"
6401,ÆNEAS.,"And so he hid them all away amid that stonydark,"
6402,ÆNEAS.,Nor toward the cave might he that sought find any four-foot mark.
6403,ÆNEAS.,
6404,ÆNEAS.,"""Meanwhile, his beasts all satiate, from fold Amphitryon's son"
6405,ÆNEAS.,"Now gets them ready for the road, and busks him to be gone;"
6406,ÆNEAS.,"When lo, the herd falls bellowing, and with its sorrow fills"
6407,ÆNEAS.,"The woodland as it goes away, and lowing leaves the hills."
6408,ÆNEAS.,"Therewith a cow gave back the sound, and in the cavern hid"
6409,ÆNEAS.,"Lowed out, and in despite his heed all Cacus' hope undid."
6410,ÆNEAS.,Then verily Alcides' ire and gall of heart outbroke
6411,ÆNEAS.,"In fury, and his arms he caught and weight of knotty oak,            220"
6412,ÆNEAS.,"And running, sought the hill aloft that thrusteth toward the skies."
6413,ÆNEAS.,"Then first our folk saw Cacus scared and trouble in his eyes,"
6414,ÆNEAS.,"And in a twinkling did he flee, no eastern wind as fleet,"
6415,ÆNEAS.,"Seeking his den, and very fear gave wings unto his feet;"
6416,ÆNEAS.,"But scarcely was he shut therein, and, breaking down the chains,"
6417,ÆNEAS.,Had dropped the monstrous rock that erst his crafty father's pains
6418,ÆNEAS.,"Hung there with iron; scarce had he blocked the doorway with the same,"
6419,ÆNEAS.,"When lo, the man of Tiryns there, who with his heart aflame"
6420,ÆNEAS.,"Eyed all the entries, here and there turning about his face,"
6421,ÆNEAS.,"Gnashing his teeth: afire with wrath, thrice all that hilly place    230"
6422,ÆNEAS.,"Of Aventine he eyeth o'er, thrice tries without avail"
6423,ÆNEAS.,"The rocky door, thrice sits him down awearied in the dale."
6424,ÆNEAS.,
6425,ÆNEAS.,"""There was a peakèd rock of flint with ragged edges dight,"
6426,ÆNEAS.,"Which at the cave's back rose aloft exceeding high to sight,"
6427,ÆNEAS.,A dwelling meet for evil fowl amidst their nests to bide;
6428,ÆNEAS.,"This, that hung o'er the brow above the river's leftward side,"
6429,ÆNEAS.,"Hard from the right he beareth on, and shakes, and from its roots"
6430,ÆNEAS.,"Wrencheth it loose, and suddenly adown the bent side shoots."
6431,ÆNEAS.,"Then ringeth all the mighty heaven with thunder of its wrack,"
6432,ÆNEAS.,"The banks are rent, the frighted stream its waters casteth back;     240"
6433,ÆNEAS.,"But Cacus' den and kingly house showed all uncovered there,"
6434,ÆNEAS.,The inmost of the shadowy cave was laid undoored and bare:
6435,ÆNEAS.,"As if the inner parts of earth 'neath mighty stroke should gape,"
6436,ÆNEAS.,"Unlocking all the house of hell, showing that country's shape,"
6437,ÆNEAS.,"The wan land all forlorn of God: there shows the unmeasured pit,"
6438,ÆNEAS.,And ghosts aquake with light of day shot through the depths of it.
6439,ÆNEAS.,
6440,ÆNEAS.,"""But Cacus, caught unwares by day whereof he had no doubt,"
6441,ÆNEAS.,"Imprisoned in the hollow rock, in strange voice bellowing out,"
6442,ÆNEAS.,"Alcides fell on from above, calling all arms to aid,"
6443,ÆNEAS.,And plenteous cast of boughs and stones upon the monster laid;       250
6444,ÆNEAS.,"While he, since now no flight availed to 'scape that peril's hold,"
6445,ÆNEAS.,"Pours from his mouth a mighty smoke, O wondrous to be told!"
6446,ÆNEAS.,"Enwrapping all the house about with blinding misty shroud,"
6447,ÆNEAS.,"Snatching the sight from eyes of men, and rolling on the cloud,"
6448,ÆNEAS.,A reeking night with heart of fire and utter blackness blent.
6449,ÆNEAS.,Alcides' spirit bore it nought; his body swift he sent
6450,ÆNEAS.,With headlong leap amid the fire where thickest rolled the wave
6451,ÆNEAS.,"Of smoke, and with its pitchy mist was flooding all the cave;"
6452,ÆNEAS.,"Cacus he catcheth in the dark spueing out fire in vain,"
6453,ÆNEAS.,"And knitteth him in knot about, and, strangling him, doth strain     260"
6454,ÆNEAS.,"The starting eyes from out of him, and throat that blood doth lack:"
6455,ÆNEAS.,Then the mirk house is opened wide; the doors are torn aback;
6456,ÆNEAS.,"The stolen kine, that prey his oath foreswore to heaven are shown,"
6457,ÆNEAS.,And by the feet is dragged today the body hideous grown;
6458,ÆNEAS.,Nor may men satiate their hearts by gazing on the thing;
6459,ÆNEAS.,"His fearful eyes, the face of him, the man-beast's fashioning"
6460,ÆNEAS.,"Of bristled breast; those jaws of his, whence faded is the flame."
6461,ÆNEAS.,
6462,ÆNEAS.,"""Hence is this honour celebrate, and they that after came"
6463,ÆNEAS.,"Still kept the day all joyfully; Potitius wrought it first,"
6464,ÆNEAS.,"This feast of mighty Hercules; the house Pinarian nursed,            270"
6465,ÆNEAS.,"The altar of the grove he reared, which Mightiest yet we call,"
6466,ÆNEAS.,"And ever more, in very sooth, shall mightiest be of all."
6467,ÆNEAS.,"So come, O youths, these glorious deeds I bid you glorify:"
6468,ÆNEAS.,"Wreathe round your hair, put forth your hands and raise the cup on high!"
6469,ÆNEAS.,"Call on the God whom all we love, and give the wine full fain!"""
6470,ÆNEAS.,
6471,ÆNEAS.,"He spake: the leaf of Hercules, the poplar coloured twain,"
6472,ÆNEAS.,Shaded his hair; the leaves entwined hung down aback his head;
6473,ÆNEAS.,"The holy beaker filled his hand: then merry all men sped,"
6474,ÆNEAS.,"And on the table poured their gift, and called the Gods to hear."
6475,ÆNEAS.,
6476,ÆNEAS.,"Meanwhile unto the slopes of heaven the Western Star drew near,      280"
6477,ÆNEAS.,"And then the priests, and chief thereof, Potitius, thither came,"
6478,ÆNEAS.,"All clad in skins, as due it was, and bearing forth the flame."
6479,ÆNEAS.,"New feast they dight, and gifts beloved of second service bring,"
6480,ÆNEAS.,And on the altar pile again the plates of offering.
6481,ÆNEAS.,The Salii then to singing-tide heart-kindled go around
6482,ÆNEAS.,The altars; every brow of them with poplar leafage bound:
6483,ÆNEAS.,"And here the youths, the elders there, set up the song of praise,"
6484,ÆNEAS.,"And sing the deeds of Hercules: How, on his first of days,"
6485,ÆNEAS.,"The monsters twain his stepdame sent, the snakes, he crushed in hand;"
6486,ÆNEAS.,"And how in war he overthrew great cities of the land,                290"
6487,ÆNEAS.,"Troy and Oechalia: how he won through thousand toils o'ergreat,"
6488,ÆNEAS.,That King Eurystheus laid on him by bitter Juno's fate.
6489,ÆNEAS.,"""O thou Unconquered, thou whose hand beat down the cloud-born two,"
6490,ÆNEAS.,"Pholeus, Hylæus, twin-wrought things, and Cretan monsters slew:"
6491,ÆNEAS.,"O thou who slew'st the lion huge 'neath that Nemean steep,"
6492,ÆNEAS.,"The Stygian mere hath quaked at thee, the ward of Orcus deep"
6493,ÆNEAS.,Quaked in his den above his bed of half-gnawed bones and blood.
6494,ÆNEAS.,At nothing fashioned wert thou feared; not when Typhoeus stood
6495,ÆNEAS.,Aloft in arms: nor from thine heart fell any rede away
6496,ÆNEAS.,When round thee headed-manifold the Worm of Lerna lay.               300
6497,ÆNEAS.,"O very child of Jupiter, O Heaven's new glory, hail!"
6498,ÆNEAS.,"Fail not thy feast with friendly foot, nor us, thy lovers, fail!"""
6499,ÆNEAS.,
6500,ÆNEAS.,"With such-like song they sing the praise, and add to all the worth"
6501,ÆNEAS.,"The cave of Cacus, and the beast that breathed the wildfire forth."
6502,ÆNEAS.,The woods sing with them as they sing; the hills are light with song.
6503,ÆNEAS.,
6504,ÆNEAS.,"So, all the holy things fulfilled, they wend their ways along"
6505,ÆNEAS.,"Unto the city: the old king afoot was with them there,"
6506,ÆNEAS.,"And bade Æneas and his son close to his side to fare,"
6507,ÆNEAS.,And as he went made light the way with talk of many a thing.
6508,ÆNEAS.,"Æneas wonders, and his eyes go lightly wandering                     310"
6509,ÆNEAS.,"O'er all; but here and there they stay, as, joyful of his ways,"
6510,ÆNEAS.,He asks and hears of tokens left by men of earlier days.
6511,ÆNEAS.,
6512,ÆNEAS.,"Then spake the King Evander, he who built up Rome of old:"
6513,ÆNEAS.,"""These woods the earth-born Fauns and Nymphs in time agone did hold,"
6514,ÆNEAS.,And men from out the tree-trunk born and very heart of oak;
6515,ÆNEAS.,"No fashion of the tilth they knew, nor how the bulls to yoke,"
6516,ÆNEAS.,"Nor how to win them store of wealth, or spare what they had got;"
6517,ÆNEAS.,The tree-boughs only cherished them and rugged chase and hot.
6518,ÆNEAS.,"Then from Olympus of the heavens first Saturn came adown,"
6519,ÆNEAS.,Fleeing the war of Jupiter and kingdom overthrown:                   320
6520,ÆNEAS.,He laid in peace the rugged folk amid the mountains steep
6521,ÆNEAS.,"Scattered about, and gave them laws, and willed them well to keep"
6522,ÆNEAS.,"The name of Latium, since he lay safe hidden on that shore."
6523,ÆNEAS.,"They call the days the Golden Days that 'neath that king outwore,"
6524,ÆNEAS.,Amid such happiness of peace o'er men-folk did he reign.
6525,ÆNEAS.,"But worsened time as on it wore, and gathered many a stain;"
6526,ÆNEAS.,"And then the battle-rage was born, and lust of gain outbroke:"
6527,ÆNEAS.,Then came the host Ausonian; then came Sicanian folk;
6528,ÆNEAS.,And oft and o'er again the land of Saturn cast its name.             329
6529,ÆNEAS.,"Then kings there were, and Thybris fierce, of monstrous body came,"
6530,ÆNEAS.,"From whom the Tiber flood is named by us of Italy,"
6531,ÆNEAS.,Its old true name of Albula being perished and gone by.
6532,ÆNEAS.,"Me, driven from my land, and strayed about the ocean's ends,"
6533,ÆNEAS.,Almighty Fortune and the Fate no struggling ever bends
6534,ÆNEAS.,"Set in these steads; my mother's word well worshipped hither drave,"
6535,ÆNEAS.,"The nymph Carmentis; and a god, Apollo, wayfare gave."""
6536,ÆNEAS.,
6537,ÆNEAS.,"Now, as he spake, hard thereunto the altar-stead doth show,"
6538,ÆNEAS.,And gate that by Carmentis' name the Roman people know;
6539,ÆNEAS.,"An honour of the olden time to nymph Carmentis, she,"
6540,ÆNEAS.,"The faithful seer, who first foretold what mighty men should be      340"
6541,ÆNEAS.,Æneas' sons; how great a name from Pallanteum should come.
6542,ÆNEAS.,Then the great grove that Romulus hallowed the fleer's home
6543,ÆNEAS.,"He showeth, and Lupercal set beneath the cliff acold,"
6544,ÆNEAS.,Called of Lycæan Pan in wise Parrhasia used of old.
6545,ÆNEAS.,"Thereafter Argiletum's grove he shows and bids it tell,"
6546,ÆNEAS.,"A very witness, where and how the guesting Argus fell."
6547,ÆNEAS.,"Next, then, to the Tarpeian stead and Capitol they went,"
6548,ÆNEAS.,"All golden now, but wild of yore with thickets' tanglement:"
6549,ÆNEAS.,E'en then at its dread holiness the folk afield would quake
6550,ÆNEAS.,And tremble sore to look upon its cliff-besetting brake.             350
6551,ÆNEAS.,
6552,ÆNEAS.,"""This grove,"" saith he, ""this hill thou seest with thicket-covered brow,"
6553,ÆNEAS.,"Some godhead haunts, we know not who: indeed Arcadians trow"
6554,ÆNEAS.,"That very Jove they there have seen, when he his blackening shield"
6555,ÆNEAS.,Hath shaken whiles and stirred the storm amidst the heavenly field.
6556,ÆNEAS.,Look therewithal on those two burgs with broken walls foredone!
6557,ÆNEAS.,There thou beholdest tokens left by folk of long agone:
6558,ÆNEAS.,"For one did Father Janus old, and one did Saturn raise,"
6559,ÆNEAS.,"Janiculum, Saturnia, they hight in ancient days."""
6560,ÆNEAS.,
6561,ÆNEAS.,Amid such talk they reach the roofs whereunder did abide
6562,ÆNEAS.,Unrich Evander; and they see the herd-beasts feeding wide            360
6563,ÆNEAS.,And lowing through the Roman Courts amid Carinæ's shine.
6564,ÆNEAS.,
6565,ÆNEAS.,"But when they came unto the house, ""Beneath these doors of mine"
6566,ÆNEAS.,"Conquering Alcides went,"" he said; ""this king's house took him in."
6567,ÆNEAS.,"Have heart to scorn world's wealth, O guest, and strive thou too to win"
6568,ÆNEAS.,"A godhead's worth: take thou no scorn of our unrich estate."""
6569,ÆNEAS.,
6570,ÆNEAS.,"He spake, and 'neath the narrow roof Æneas' body great"
6571,ÆNEAS.,"He led withal, and set him down; and such a bed was there"
6572,ÆNEAS.,"As 'twas of leaves, and overlaid with skin of Libyan bear."
6573,ÆNEAS.,
6574,ÆNEAS.,"Night falleth, and its dusky wings spreads o'er the face of earth,"
6575,ÆNEAS.,"When Venus, fearful in her soul (nor less than fear 'twas worth),    370"
6576,ÆNEAS.,"Sore troubled by Laurentine threats and all the tumult dread,"
6577,ÆNEAS.,"Bespeaketh Vulcan, as she lay upon his golden bed,"
6578,ÆNEAS.,And holiness of very love amidst her words she bore:
6579,ÆNEAS.,
6580,ÆNEAS.,"""When Argive kings were wasting Troy predestined with their war,"
6581,ÆNEAS.,"Were wracking towers foredoomed to fall mid flames of hating men,"
6582,ÆNEAS.,"No help of thine for hapless ones, no arms I asked for then,"
6583,ÆNEAS.,Wrought by thy craft and mastery: nor would I have thee spend
6584,ÆNEAS.,"Thy labour, O beloved spouse, to win no happy end;"
6585,ÆNEAS.,"Though many things to Priam's house meseemeth did I owe,"
6586,ÆNEAS.,And oftentimes I needs must weep Æneas' pain and woe.                380
6587,ÆNEAS.,"But now that he by Jove's command Rutulian shores hath won,"
6588,ÆNEAS.,"I am thy suppliant, asking arms, a mother for her son,"
6589,ÆNEAS.,"Praying thy godhead's holiness: time was when Nereus' seed,"
6590,ÆNEAS.,"Tithonus' wife, with many tears could bend thee to thy need."
6591,ÆNEAS.,"Look round, what peoples gather now; what cities shut within"
6592,ÆNEAS.,"Their barrèd gates are whetting sword to slay me and my kin."""
6593,ÆNEAS.,
6594,ÆNEAS.,"She spake: with snowy arms of God she fondled him about,"
6595,ÆNEAS.,"And wound him in her soft embrace, while yet he hung in doubt:"
6596,ÆNEAS.,Sudden the wonted fire struck home; unto his inmost drew
6597,ÆNEAS.,"The old familiar heat, and all his melting bones ran through:        390"
6598,ÆNEAS.,"No otherwise than whiles it is when rolls the thunder loud,"
6599,ÆNEAS.,And gleaming of the fiery rent breaks up the world of cloud.
6600,ÆNEAS.,In glory of her loveliness she felt her guile had gained.
6601,ÆNEAS.,"Then spake the Father, overcome by Love that ne'er hath waned:"
6602,ÆNEAS.,
6603,ÆNEAS.,"""Why fish thy reasons from the deep? where is thy trust in me,"
6604,ÆNEAS.,"I prithee, O my God and Love? Had such wish weighed on thee,"
6605,ÆNEAS.,"Then, also, had it been my part to arm the Teucrian hand,"
6606,ÆNEAS.,"Nor had the Almighty Sire nor Fate forbidden Troy to stand,"
6607,ÆNEAS.,And Priam might have held it out another ten years yet.
6608,ÆNEAS.,"And now if thou wouldst wage the war, if thus thy soul is set,       400"
6609,ÆNEAS.,Thy longing shall have whatsoe'er this craft of mine may lend;
6610,ÆNEAS.,"Whatever in iron may be done, or silver-golden blend;"
6611,ÆNEAS.,"Whatever wind and fire may do: I prithee pray no more,"
6612,ÆNEAS.,"But trust the glory of thy might."""
6613,ÆNEAS.,So when his words wore o'er
6614,ÆNEAS.,"He gave the enfolding that she would, and shed upon her breast"
6615,ÆNEAS.,"He lay, and over all his limbs he drew the sleepy rest."
6616,ÆNEAS.,"But when the midmost night was worn, and slumber, past its prime,"
6617,ÆNEAS.,"Had faded out, in sooth it was that woman's rising-time,"
6618,ÆNEAS.,Who needs must prop her life with rock and slender mastery           409
6619,ÆNEAS.,"That Pallas gives: she wakes the ash and flames that smouldering lie,"
6620,ÆNEAS.,"And, adding night unto her toil, driveth her maids to win"
6621,ÆNEAS.,"Long task before its kindled light, that she may keep from sin"
6622,ÆNEAS.,Her bride-bed; that her little ones well waxen-up may be.
6623,ÆNEAS.,"Not otherwise that Might of Fire, no sluggard more than she,"
6624,ÆNEAS.,To win his art and handicraft from that soft bed arose.
6625,ÆNEAS.,Upon the flank of Sicily there hangs an island close
6626,ÆNEAS.,"To Lipari of Æolus, with shear-hewn smoky steep;"
6627,ÆNEAS.,"Beneath it thunder caves and dens Ætnæan, eaten deep"
6628,ÆNEAS.,With forges of the Cyclops: thence men hear the anvils cry
6629,ÆNEAS.,"'Neath mighty strokes, and through the cave the hissing sparkles fly  420"
6630,ÆNEAS.,"From iron of the Chalybes, and pants the forge with flame."
6631,ÆNEAS.,"The house is Vulcan's, and the land Vulcania hath to name."
6632,ÆNEAS.,
6633,ÆNEAS.,"Thither the Master of the Fire went down from upper air,"
6634,ÆNEAS.,Where Cyclop folk in mighty den were forging iron gear;
6635,ÆNEAS.,"Pyracmon of the naked limbs, Brontes and Steropes."
6636,ÆNEAS.,"A thunderbolt half-fashioned yet was in the hands of these,"
6637,ÆNEAS.,"Part-wrought, suchwise as many an one the Father casts on earth"
6638,ÆNEAS.,"From all the heaven, but otherwhere unfinished from the birth,"
6639,ÆNEAS.,"Three rays they wrought of writhen storm, three of the watery wrack;"
6640,ÆNEAS.,Nor do the three of ruddy flame nor windy winging lack:              430
6641,ÆNEAS.,"And now the work of fearful flash, and roar, and dread they won,"
6642,ÆNEAS.,And blent amid their craftsmanship the flame that followeth on.
6643,ÆNEAS.,"But otherwhere they dight the wain and wingèd wheels of Mars,"
6644,ÆNEAS.,Wherewith the men and walls of men he waketh up to wars.
6645,ÆNEAS.,"There angry Pallas's arms they wrought and Ægis full of fear,"
6646,ÆNEAS.,"And set the gold and serpent scales, and did with mighty care"
6647,ÆNEAS.,"The knitted adders, and for breast of very God did deck"
6648,ÆNEAS.,The Gorgon rolling eyen still above her severed neck.
6649,ÆNEAS.,"""Do all away,"" he said, ""lay by the labour so far done;"
6650,ÆNEAS.,"Cyclops of Ætna, turn your minds to this one thing alone:            440"
6651,ÆNEAS.,Arms for a great man must be wrought; betake ye to your might;
6652,ÆNEAS.,"Betake ye to your nimble hands and all your mastery's sleight,"
6653,ÆNEAS.,"And hurry tarrying into haste."""
6654,ÆNEAS.,No more he spake: all they
6655,ÆNEAS.,Fall swift to work and portion out the labour of the day:
6656,ÆNEAS.,"The brazen rivers run about with metal of the gold,"
6657,ÆNEAS.,And soft the Chalyb bane-master flows in the forges' hold.
6658,ÆNEAS.,A mighty shield they set on foot to match all weapons held
6659,ÆNEAS.,"By Latin men, and sevenfold ring on ring about it weld."
6660,ÆNEAS.,"Meanwhile, in windy bellows' womb some in the breezes take"
6661,ÆNEAS.,"And give them forth, some dip the brass all hissing in the lake,     450"
6662,ÆNEAS.,And all the cavern is agroan with strokes on anvil laid.
6663,ÆNEAS.,"There turn and turn about betwixt, with plenteous might to aid,"
6664,ÆNEAS.,They rear their arms; with grip of tongs they turn the iron o'er.
6665,ÆNEAS.,
6666,ÆNEAS.,But while the Lemnian Father thus speeds on the Æolean shore
6667,ÆNEAS.,"The lovely light Evander stirs amid his lowly house,"
6668,ÆNEAS.,And morning song of eave-dwellers from sleep the king doth rouse.
6669,ÆNEAS.,"Riseth that ancient man of days and on his kirtle does,"
6670,ÆNEAS.,And both his feet he binds about with bonds of Tyrrhene shoes;
6671,ÆNEAS.,"Then Tegeæan sword he girds to shoulder and to side,"
6672,ÆNEAS.,And on the left he flings aback the cloak of panther-hide.           460
6673,ÆNEAS.,"Moreover, from the threshold step goes either watchful ward,"
6674,ÆNEAS.,"Two dogs to wit, that follow close the footsteps of their lord."
6675,ÆNEAS.,"So to the chamber of his guest the hero goes his way,"
6676,ÆNEAS.,Well mindful of his spoken word and that well-promised stay.
6677,ÆNEAS.,"Nor less Æneas was afoot betimes that morning-tide,"
6678,ÆNEAS.,And Pallas and Achates went each one their lord beside.
6679,ÆNEAS.,"So met, they join their right hands there and in the house sit down,"
6680,ÆNEAS.,"And win the joy of spoken words, that lawful now hath grown;"
6681,ÆNEAS.,And thuswise speaks Evander first:
6682,ÆNEAS.,
6683,ÆNEAS.,"""O mightiest duke of Trojan men,--for surely, thou being safe,       470"
6684,ÆNEAS.,"My heart may never more believe in Troy-town's vanquishing,--"
6685,ÆNEAS.,The battle-help that I may give is but a little thing
6686,ÆNEAS.,For such a name: by Tuscan stream on this side are we bound;
6687,ÆNEAS.,On that side come Rutulian arms to gird our walls with sound.
6688,ÆNEAS.,"But 'tis my rede to join to you a mighty folk of fight,"
6689,ÆNEAS.,A wealthy lordship: chance unhoped this hope for us hath dight;
6690,ÆNEAS.,So draw thou thither whereunto the Fates are calling on.
6691,ÆNEAS.,"Not far hence is a place of men, on rock of yore agone"
6692,ÆNEAS.,"Built up; Agylla's city 'tis, where glorious folk of war,"
6693,ÆNEAS.,"The Lydian folk, on Tuscan hills pitched their abode of yore.        480"
6694,ÆNEAS.,"A many years of blooming once they had, until the king"
6695,ÆNEAS.,Mezentius held them 'neath his pride and cruel warfaring.
6696,ÆNEAS.,"Why tell those deaths unspeakable, and many a tyrant's deed?"
6697,ÆNEAS.,May the Gods store them for the heads of him and all his seed!
6698,ÆNEAS.,"Yea, yea, dead corpses would he join to bodies living yet,"
6699,ÆNEAS.,"And hand to hand, O misery! and mouth to mouth would set;"
6700,ÆNEAS.,"There, drenched with gore and drenched with dew of death, must they abide,"
6701,ÆNEAS.,"A foul embrace unspeakable, and long and long they died."
6702,ÆNEAS.,"Worn out at last, his folk in arms beset his house about,"
6703,ÆNEAS.,"And him therein all mad with rage, cut off his following rout,        490"
6704,ÆNEAS.,And cast the wildfire therewithal over his roof on high:
6705,ÆNEAS.,"But he, amidst the slaughter slipped, to fields of Rutuli"
6706,ÆNEAS.,"Made shift to flee, and there is held a guest by Turnus' sword."
6707,ÆNEAS.,"So by just anger raised today Etruria is abroad,"
6708,ÆNEAS.,"Crying with Mars to aid, 'Give back the king to pay the cost!'"
6709,ÆNEAS.,"Æneas, I will make thee now the captain of their host:"
6710,ÆNEAS.,For down the whole coast goes the roar from out their ship-host's pack;
6711,ÆNEAS.,They cry to bear the banners forth; but them still holdeth back
6712,ÆNEAS.,"The ancient seer, thus singing Fate: _Mæonia's chosen peers,_"
6713,ÆNEAS.,"_The heart and flower of men of old, whom grief's just measure bears_  500"
6714,ÆNEAS.,"_Against the foe; souls that your king hath stirred to righteous wrath,_"
6715,ÆNEAS.,_No man of Italy is meet to lead this army forth;_
6716,ÆNEAS.,"_Seek outland captains._ Then, indeed, the Tuscan war array,"
6717,ÆNEAS.,"Feared by such warnings of the Gods, amidst these meadows lay."
6718,ÆNEAS.,"Tarchon himself hath hither sent sweet speakers, bearing me"
6719,ÆNEAS.,"Their lordships' kingly staff and crown, and signs of royalty;"
6720,ÆNEAS.,And bidding take the Tuscan land and join their camp of war.
6721,ÆNEAS.,"But eld adull with winter frost and spent with days of yore,"
6722,ÆNEAS.,My body over-old for deeds begrudged such government.
6723,ÆNEAS.,"I would have stirred my son, but he, with Sabine mother blent,       510"
6724,ÆNEAS.,Shared blood of this Italian land: but thee the Fates endow
6725,ÆNEAS.,With years and race full meet hereto; the Gods call on thee now.
6726,ÆNEAS.,"Go forth, O captain valorous of Italy and Troy."
6727,ÆNEAS.,"Yea, I will give thee Pallas here, my hope and darling joy,"
6728,ÆNEAS.,"And bid him 'neath thy mastery learn in battle to be bold,"
6729,ÆNEAS.,"And win the heavy work of Mars, and all thy deeds behold;"
6730,ÆNEAS.,"And, wondering at thy valiancy, win through his earliest years."
6731,ÆNEAS.,"Two hundred knights of Arcady, the bloom of all it bears,"
6732,ÆNEAS.,"I give thee; in his own name, too, like host shall Pallas bring."""
6733,ÆNEAS.,
6734,ÆNEAS.,"Scarce had he said, and still their gaze unto the earth did cling,   520"
6735,ÆNEAS.,"Æneas of Anchises born and his Achates true,"
6736,ÆNEAS.,"For many thoughts of matters hard their minds were running through,"
6737,ÆNEAS.,When Cytherea gave a sign amid the open sky;
6738,ÆNEAS.,"For from the left a flash of light went quivering suddenly,"
6739,ÆNEAS.,"And sound went with it, and all things in utter turmoil fared,"
6740,ÆNEAS.,And clangour of the Tyrrhene trump along the heavens blared.
6741,ÆNEAS.,"They look up; ever and anon a mighty clash they hear,"
6742,ÆNEAS.,"And gleams they see betwixt the clouds, amid the sky-land clear,"
6743,ÆNEAS.,"The glitter of the arms of God, the thunder of their clang."
6744,ÆNEAS.,
6745,ÆNEAS.,"The man of Troy, while others' hearts amazed and fearful hang,       530"
6746,ÆNEAS.,"Knoweth the sound, the promised help, his Goddess-mother's meed."
6747,ÆNEAS.,"He saith: ""Yea, verily, O host, to ask is little need"
6748,ÆNEAS.,What hap this portent draweth on: the Gods will have me wend;
6749,ÆNEAS.,The God that made me promised erst such heavenly signs to send
6750,ÆNEAS.,If war were toward; and through the sky she promised to bear down
6751,ÆNEAS.,Arms Vulcan-fashioned for my need.
6752,ÆNEAS.,"Woe's me for poor Laurentium's folk! what death, what bloody graves!"
6753,ÆNEAS.,"--Ah, Turnus, thou shalt pay it me!--how many 'neath thy waves,"
6754,ÆNEAS.,"O Father Tiber, shalt thou roll the shields and helms of men,"
6755,ÆNEAS.,"And bodies of the mighty ones! Cry war, oath-breakers, then!""        540"
6756,ÆNEAS.,
6757,ÆNEAS.,"And as he spake the word he rose from off the lofty throne,"
6758,ÆNEAS.,And the slaked fire of Hercules roused on the altar-stone;
6759,ÆNEAS.,And joyfully he drew anear the God of yesterday
6760,ÆNEAS.,"And little House-Gods: chosen ewes in manner due they slay,"
6761,ÆNEAS.,Evander and the youth of Troy together side by side.
6762,ÆNEAS.,"Then to the ships they wend their ways, where yet their fellows bide:"
6763,ÆNEAS.,"There men to follow him in fight he chooseth from the peers,"
6764,ÆNEAS.,The flower of hardy hearts; the rest the downlong water bears;
6765,ÆNEAS.,"Deedless they swim adown the stream, Ascanius home to bring"
6766,ÆNEAS.,The tidings of his coming sire and matters flourishing.              550
6767,ÆNEAS.,
6768,ÆNEAS.,But horses get such Teucrian men as are for Tyrrhene mead;
6769,ÆNEAS.,By lot they choose Æneas one which yellow lion's weed
6770,ÆNEAS.,"Goes all about; full fair it shone, for it was golden-clawed."
6771,ÆNEAS.,"Then sudden through the little town the rumour flies abroad,"
6772,ÆNEAS.,That knights will speedily ride forth to Tyrrhene kingly stead.
6773,ÆNEAS.,"Then fear redoubleth mothers' prayers, and nigher draweth dread"
6774,ÆNEAS.,"In peril's hand, and greater still the face of Mars doth grow."
6775,ÆNEAS.,
6776,ÆNEAS.,"Father Evander strains the hand of him that needs must go,"
6777,ÆNEAS.,"Clinging with tears insatiate, and such a word doth say:"
6778,ÆNEAS.,"""O me! would Jove bring back again the years long worn away!         560"
6779,ÆNEAS.,Were I as when the foremost foes upon Præneste's field
6780,ÆNEAS.,"I felled, and burnt victoriously a heap of shield on shield:"
6781,ÆNEAS.,"When with this very hand I sent King Herilus to Hell,"
6782,ÆNEAS.,"Whose dam, Feronia, at his birth,--wild is the tale to tell,--"
6783,ÆNEAS.,"Had given him gift of threefold life; three times the sword to shake,"
6784,ÆNEAS.,And thrice to fall upon the field: yet did this right hand take
6785,ÆNEAS.,"That threefold life away from him, thrice spoiled him of his gear."
6786,ÆNEAS.,"O were I such, ne'er would I break from thine embracing dear,"
6787,ÆNEAS.,"O son; nor had Mezentius erst, the tyrant neighbour lord,"
6788,ÆNEAS.,"In my despite so many deaths wrought with his cruel sword,           570"
6789,ÆNEAS.,Nor widowed this our city here of such a host of sons.
6790,ÆNEAS.,"But ye, O Gods!--thou Mightiest, King of all heavenly ones,"
6791,ÆNEAS.,"O Jove, have pity now, I pray, upon the Arcadian King,"
6792,ÆNEAS.,"And hear a father's prayers! for if your mighty governing,--"
6793,ÆNEAS.,"If Fate shall keep my Pallas safe, and I may live to see"
6794,ÆNEAS.,"His face again,--if he return to keep our unity,"
6795,ÆNEAS.,"Then may I live, and any toil, such as ye will, abide!"
6796,ÆNEAS.,"But, Fortune, if thou threatenest ill, and misery betide,"
6797,ÆNEAS.,"Then let me now, yea, now indeed, the cruel life break through,"
6798,ÆNEAS.,While yet my fear is unfulfilled and hope may yet come true;         580
6799,ÆNEAS.,"While thee, belovèd joy of eld, I wrap mine arms around,"
6800,ÆNEAS.,"Ere yet the tale of evil hap mine ancient ears may wound."""
6801,ÆNEAS.,
6802,ÆNEAS.,"Thus at their last departing-tide the father poured the prayer,"
6803,ÆNEAS.,"Whom, fainting now, the serving-men back within doors must bear;"
6804,ÆNEAS.,"While forth from out the open gate the host of horsemen ride,"
6805,ÆNEAS.,"Æneas and Achates leal in forefront of their pride,"
6806,ÆNEAS.,"And then the other Trojan lords: amidst the company,"
6807,ÆNEAS.,"In cloak adorned and painted arms, was Pallas fair to see:"
6808,ÆNEAS.,"E'en such as Lucifer, when he bathed in the ocean stream,"
6809,ÆNEAS.,"The light beloved of Venus well o'er every starry beam,              590"
6810,ÆNEAS.,Hath raised his holy head in heaven and down the darkness rent.
6811,ÆNEAS.,"The fearful mothers on the walls their eyen after sent,"
6812,ÆNEAS.,Following the dusty cloud of them and ranks of glittering brass.
6813,ÆNEAS.,But mid the thicket places there by nighest road they pass
6814,ÆNEAS.,Unto their end in weed of war: with shout and serried band
6815,ÆNEAS.,The clattering hooves of four-foot things shake down the dusty land.
6816,ÆNEAS.,
6817,ÆNEAS.,"There is a mighty thicket-place by chilly Cæres' side,"
6818,ÆNEAS.,By ancient dread of fathers gone held holy far and wide:
6819,ÆNEAS.,A place that hollow hills shut in and pine-wood black begirds.
6820,ÆNEAS.,"Men say that to Silvanus erst, the God of fields and herds,          600"
6821,ÆNEAS.,"The old Pelasgi hallowed it, and made a holy day,"
6822,ÆNEAS.,E'en those who in the time agone on Latin marches lay.
6823,ÆNEAS.,No great way hence the Tuscan folk and Tarcho held them still
6824,ÆNEAS.,In guarded camp; the host of them from rising of a hill
6825,ÆNEAS.,"Might now be seen, as far and wide they spread about the field."
6826,ÆNEAS.,"Father Æneas and his folk, the mighty under shield,"
6827,ÆNEAS.,"Speed hither, and forewearied now their steeds and bodies tend."
6828,ÆNEAS.,"But through the clouds of heavenly way doth fair white Venus wend,"
6829,ÆNEAS.,Bearing the gift; who when she saw in hidden valley there
6830,ÆNEAS.,"Her son afar, apart from men by river cool and fair,                 610"
6831,ÆNEAS.,"Then kind she came before his eyes, and in such words she spake:"
6832,ÆNEAS.,"""These promised gifts, my husband's work, O son, I bid thee take:"
6833,ÆNEAS.,"So shalt thou be all void of doubt, O son, when presently"
6834,ÆNEAS.,"Laurentines proud and Turnus fierce thou bidst the battle try."""
6835,ÆNEAS.,
6836,ÆNEAS.,"So spake the Cytherean one and sought her son's embrace,"
6837,ÆNEAS.,And hung the beaming arms upon an oak that stood in face.
6838,ÆNEAS.,"But he, made glad by godhead's gift, and such a glory great,"
6839,ÆNEAS.,"Marvelleth and rolleth o'er it all his eyes insatiate,"
6840,ÆNEAS.,And turns the pieces o'er and o'er his hands and arms between;
6841,ÆNEAS.,The helm that flasheth flames abroad with crest so dread beseen:     620
6842,ÆNEAS.,"The sword to do the deeds of Fate; the hard-wrought plates of brass,"
6843,ÆNEAS.,"Blood-red and huge; yea, e'en as when the bright sun brings to pass"
6844,ÆNEAS.,Its burning through the coal-blue clouds and shines o'er field and fold:
6845,ÆNEAS.,The light greaves forged and forged again of silver-blend and gold:
6846,ÆNEAS.,"The spear, and, thing most hard to tell, the plating of the shield."
6847,ÆNEAS.,For there the tale of Italy and Roman joy afield
6848,ÆNEAS.,"That Master of the Fire had wrought, not unlearned of the seers,"
6849,ÆNEAS.,"Or blind to see the days before. The men of coming years,"
6850,ÆNEAS.,"Ascanius stem, all foughten fields, were wrought in due array."
6851,ÆNEAS.,
6852,ÆNEAS.,"In the green den of Mavors there the fostering she-wolf lay,         630"
6853,ÆNEAS.,"The twin lads sporting round the beast, clung to her udders there,"
6854,ÆNEAS.,"And sucked the nursing mother-wolf, and nothing knew of fear;"
6855,ÆNEAS.,"But she, with lithe neck turned about, now this now that caressed,"
6856,ÆNEAS.,And either body with her tongue for hardy shaping pressed.
6857,ÆNEAS.,Rome had he done anigh thereto and Sabine maidens caught
6858,ÆNEAS.,From concourse of the hollow seats when roundway games were wrought
6859,ÆNEAS.,There for the sons of Romulus the sudden war upstarts
6860,ÆNEAS.,"With Tatius, the old king of days, and Cures' hardy hearts."
6861,ÆNEAS.,"Then those two kings, the battle quenched, yet clad in battle-gear,"
6862,ÆNEAS.,"Stand with the bowl in hand before the fire of Jupiter,              640"
6863,ÆNEAS.,As each to each o'er slaughtered sow the troth of peace they plight.
6864,ÆNEAS.,
6865,ÆNEAS.,Anigh is Metius piecemeal dragged by foursome chariots light.
6866,ÆNEAS.,"--Ah, Alban, by the troth of words 'twere better to abide!--"
6867,ÆNEAS.,"There Tullus strews his lying flesh about the thicket wide,"
6868,ÆNEAS.,Nor sprinkling of a traitor's blood the bramble-bushes lack.
6869,ÆNEAS.,
6870,ÆNEAS.,"There was Porsena bidding men take outcast Tarquin back,"
6871,ÆNEAS.,The while his mighty leaguer lay about the city's weal.
6872,ÆNEAS.,For freedom there Æneas' sons were rushing on the steel:
6873,ÆNEAS.,"As full of wrath, as one who threats, might ye behold his frown,"
6874,ÆNEAS.,Because that Cocles was of heart to break the bridge adown;          650
6875,ÆNEAS.,And Cloelia from her bursten bonds was swimming o'er the flood.
6876,ÆNEAS.,
6877,ÆNEAS.,On topmost of Tarpeian burg the warden Manlius stood
6878,ÆNEAS.,"Before the house of God, and held the Capitol high-set;"
6879,ÆNEAS.,Whereon with straw of Romulus the roof was bristling yet.
6880,ÆNEAS.,"There fluttering mid the golden porch the silver goose was done,"
6881,ÆNEAS.,The seer that told of Gaulish feet unto the threshold won:
6882,ÆNEAS.,"Then through the brake the Gauls were come, and held the castle's height,"
6883,ÆNEAS.,Beneath the shielding of the mirk and gift of shadowy night.
6884,ÆNEAS.,"All golden are the locks of these, and golden is their gear,         659"
6885,ÆNEAS.,And fair they shine in welted coats; their milk-white necks do bear
6886,ÆNEAS.,"The twisted gold; each one in hand two Alpine spears doth wield,"
6887,ÆNEAS.,And guarded are their bodies well with plenteous length of shield.
6888,ÆNEAS.,
6889,ÆNEAS.,"The Salii in their dancing game; the naked Luperci,"
6890,ÆNEAS.,"With crests that bore the tuft of wool and shields from out the sky,"
6891,ÆNEAS.,There had he wrought: the mothers chaste in softly-gliding car
6892,ÆNEAS.,"Bore holy things the city through. Yea, he had wrought afar"
6893,ÆNEAS.,"The very house of Tartarus, and doors of Dis the deep,"
6894,ÆNEAS.,"And dooms of evil: there wert thou hung on the beetling steep,"
6895,ÆNEAS.,"O Catiline, and quaking sore 'neath many a fiendly face;"
6896,ÆNEAS.,While Cato gave the good their laws in happy hidden place.           670
6897,ÆNEAS.,
6898,ÆNEAS.,The image of the swelling sea amidst of these there lay
6899,ÆNEAS.,"All golden, with the blue o'erfoamed with flecks of hoary spray,"
6900,ÆNEAS.,"And dolphins shining silver-white with tail-stroke swept the wave,"
6901,ÆNEAS.,And gathered in an orbèd band the flowing waters clave.
6902,ÆNEAS.,And in the midst were brazen fleets and show of Actium's wars
6903,ÆNEAS.,And all Leucate set a-boil with ordered game of Mars
6904,ÆNEAS.,There might ye see; and all the flood lit up with golden light.
6905,ÆNEAS.,"Augustus Cæsar, leading on Italian men to fight"
6906,ÆNEAS.,"With Father-folk, and Household Gods, and Gods of greater name,"
6907,ÆNEAS.,"Stood high on deck: his joyful brow flashed forth a twofold flame,   680"
6908,ÆNEAS.,His father's star above his head is shining glory-clear.
6909,ÆNEAS.,"With wind to aid and God to aid, Agrippa otherwhere"
6910,ÆNEAS.,Leads on the host from high; whose brows with glorious battle-sign
6911,ÆNEAS.,"Are decked; for with the crown of beaks, the ship-host's prize, they shine."
6912,ÆNEAS.,
6913,ÆNEAS.,"But Antony, with outland force and arms wrought diversely,"
6914,ÆNEAS.,"Victorious from the morning-folks and ruddy-stranded sea,"
6915,ÆNEAS.,Bore Egypt and the Eastland might and Bactria's outer ends;
6916,ÆNEAS.,And after him--O shame to tell!--a wife of Egypt wends.
6917,ÆNEAS.,
6918,ÆNEAS.,"They rush together; all the sea is beaten into foam,"
6919,ÆNEAS.,Torn by the great three-tynèd beaks and oar-blades driven home:      690
6920,ÆNEAS.,They seek the deep: ye might have thought that uptorn Cyclades
6921,ÆNEAS.,"Swam o'er the main, that mountains met high mountains on the seas,"
6922,ÆNEAS.,With such a world of towered ships fall on those folks of war.
6923,ÆNEAS.,The hempen flame they fling from hand; they cast the dart afar
6924,ÆNEAS.,"Of wingèd steel, and Neptune's lea reddens with death anew."
6925,ÆNEAS.,The Queen amidst calls on her host with timbrel fashioned due
6926,ÆNEAS.,"In Egypt's guise, nor looks aback the adders twain to see;"
6927,ÆNEAS.,"Barking Anubis, shapes of God wild-wrought and diversely"
6928,ÆNEAS.,"'Gainst Neptune and 'gainst Venus fair, and 'gainst Minerva's weal"
6929,ÆNEAS.,Put forth the spear; and Mavors' wrath was fashioned forth in steel  700
6930,ÆNEAS.,"Amidst the fight: the Dreadful Ones stooped evil-wrought from heaven,"
6931,ÆNEAS.,And Discord stalked all glad at heart beneath her mantle riven;
6932,ÆNEAS.,"And after her, red scourge in hand, did dire Bellona go."
6933,ÆNEAS.,
6934,ÆNEAS.,"All this Apollo, Actian-housed, beheld, and bent his bow"
6935,ÆNEAS.,"From high aloft, and with his fear all Egypt fell to wrack,"
6936,ÆNEAS.,And Ind and Araby; and all Sabæans turned the back.
6937,ÆNEAS.,"Then once again the Queen was wrought, who on the winds doth cry,"
6938,ÆNEAS.,"And spreadeth sail; and now, and now, the slackened sheet lets fly."
6939,ÆNEAS.,"The Lord of Fire had wrought her there wan with the death to be,"
6940,ÆNEAS.,"Borne on, amid the death of men, by wind and following sea.          710"
6941,ÆNEAS.,"But Nile was wrought to meet them there, with body great to grieve,"
6942,ÆNEAS.,"And in the folding of his cloak the vanquished to receive,"
6943,ÆNEAS.,"To take them to his bosom grey, his flood of hidden home."
6944,ÆNEAS.,"There Cæsar threefold triumphing, borne on amidst of Rome,"
6945,ÆNEAS.,Three hundred shrines was hallowing to Gods of Italy
6946,ÆNEAS.,Through all the city; glorious gift that nevermore shall die;
6947,ÆNEAS.,The while all ways with joy and game and plenteous praising rang.
6948,ÆNEAS.,In all the temples altars were; in all the mothers sang
6949,ÆNEAS.,Before the altars; on the earth the steers' due slaughter lay.
6950,ÆNEAS.,But on the snow-white threshold there of Phoebus bright as day       720
6951,ÆNEAS.,"He sat and took the nations' gifts, and on the glorious door"
6952,ÆNEAS.,"He hung them up: in long array the tamed folks went before,"
6953,ÆNEAS.,As diverse in their tongues as in their arms and garments' guise.
6954,ÆNEAS.,"The Nomads had he fashioned there, that Mulciber the wise,"
6955,ÆNEAS.,"And Afric's all ungirded folk; Carians and Leleges,"
6956,ÆNEAS.,Shafted Geloni: softlier there Euphrates rolled his seas;
6957,ÆNEAS.,"The Morini, the last of men, the hornèd Rhine, were there,"
6958,ÆNEAS.,"Danæ untamed, Araxes loth the chaining bridge to bear."
6959,ÆNEAS.,
6960,ÆNEAS.,"So on the shield, his mother's gift by Vulcan fashioned fair,"
6961,ÆNEAS.,"He wondereth, blind of things to come but glad the tale to see,      730"

8509,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,What time in arms against the bolts from Jove of Heaven that flew
8510,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,He clashed upon the fifty shields and fifty sword-points drew:
8511,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"So conquering, over all the mead Æneas' fury burns                   569"

8515,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"In utter dread they turn about, and rushing back again,"
8516,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,They shed their master on the earth and shoreward drag the wain.
8517,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,
8518,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"Meanwhile with twi-yoked horses white fares Lucagus midst men,"

8521,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"Them and their war-rage in no wise Æneas might abide,"
8522,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"But on he rushes, showing huge with upheaved threatening shaft."
8523,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,Then Liger cast a word at him:                                       580
8524,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"""No steeds of Diomede thou seest, and no Achilles' car"

8526,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"Here on this earth."""
8527,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"Such words as these from witless Liger stray,"
8528,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,But nought in bandying of words the man of Troy would play;
8529,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"Rather his mighty battle-shaft he hurled against the foe,"
8530,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"While Lucagus his horses drives with spear-butt, bending low"
8531,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"Over the lash, and setteth forth his left foot for the fight."
8532,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"Beneath the bright shield's nether rim the spear-shaft takes its flight,"
8533,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"Piercing his groin upon the left: then shaken from his wain,"
8534,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,He tumbleth down and rolleth o'er in death upon the plain.           590
8535,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,To whom a fierce and bitter word godly Æneas said:

8537,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"""Ho, Lucagus! no dastard flight of steeds thy car betrayed,"
8538,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"No empty shadow turned them back from facing of the foe,"

8540,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,
8541,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"He spake, and caught the reins withal; slipped down that wretched one"
8542,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"His brother, and stretched forth the hands that little deed had done:"
8543,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"""By thee, by those that brought thee forth so glorious unto day,"

8545,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,
8546,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"Æneas cut athwart his speech: ""Not so erewhile ye spake."
8547,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"Die! ill it were for brother thus a brother to forsake.""             600"
8548,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,And in his breast the sword he drave home to the house of breath.
8549,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,
8550,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"Thus through the meads the Dardan Duke set forth the tale of death,"
8551,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"With rage as of the rushing flood, or whirl-storm of the wind."
8552,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"At last they break forth into field and leave their camp behind,"
8553,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,Ascanius and the lads of war in vain beleaguerèd.
8554,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,
8555,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,Meanwhile to Juno Jupiter set forth the speech and said:

8560,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,
8561,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"To whom spake Juno, meek of mood: ""And why, O fairest lord,"

8563,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"But in my soul were love as strong as once it used to be,"
8564,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"And should be, thou though all of might wouldst ne'er deny it me,"
8565,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"That Turnus I should draw away from out the midst of fight,"
8566,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,That I might keep him safe to bless his father Daunus' sight.
8567,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"Now let him die, let hallowed blood the Teucrian hate atone:"
8568,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,And yet indeed his name and race from blood of ours hath grown;

8571,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,
8572,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,To whom air-high Olympus' king short-worded answer made:
8573,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"""If for the youth who soon must fall respite of death is prayed,"
8574,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"And tarrying-time, nor aught thou deem'st but that my doom must stand,"

8576,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,So far thy longing may I please: but if a greater grace
8577,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"Lurk 'neath thy prayers, and thou hast hope to change the battle's face,"
8578,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"And turmoil everything once more, thou feedest hope in vain."""
8579,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,
8580,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"Then Juno weeping: ""Ah, but if thy heart should give the gain"

8584,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"And may thy rede as thou hast might be turned to better wise."""
8585,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,
8586,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"She spake the word and cast herself adown from heaven the high,"
8587,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"Girt round with rain-cloud, driving on a storm amid the sky,"
8588,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,And that Laurentian leaguer sought and Ilium's hedge of fight.
8589,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,And there she fashioned of the cloud a shadow lacking might:
8590,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"With image of Æneas' shape the wondrous show is drest,"
8591,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"She decks it with the Dardan spear and shield, and mocks the crest"
8592,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"Of that all-godlike head, and gives a speech that empty flows,"
8593,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"Sound without soul, and counterfeits the gait wherewith he goes,--   640"
8594,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"As dead men's images they say about the air will sweep,"

8596,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"But in the forefront of the fight war-merry goes the thing,"
8597,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,And cries the warrior on with words and weapons brandishing:
8598,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"On whom falls Turnus, and afar hurleth his whizzing spear:"
8599,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,Then turns the phantom back about and fleeth as in fear.
8600,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,Then verily when Turnus deemed he saw Æneas fled.
8601,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,With all the emptiness of hope his headlong heart he fed:
8602,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"""Where fleest thou, Æneas, then? why leave thy plighted bride?       649"
8603,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"This hand shall give thee earth thou sought'st so far across the tide."""
8604,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"So cries he following, brandishing his naked sword on high,"

8606,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,
8607,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"By hap a ship was moored anear unto a ledgy stone,"

8613,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"Scarce on the prow, ere Juno brake the mooring-rope atwain,"
8614,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,And rapt the sundered ship away o'er back-draught of the main.       660
8615,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"And there afar from fight is he on whom Æneas cries,"
8616,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,Still sending down to death's abode an host of enemies;
8617,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"Nor any more the image then will seek his shape to shroud,"
8618,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,But flying upward blendeth him amid the mirky cloud.
8619,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,
8620,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"Meanwhile, as midmost of the sea the flood bore Turnus on,"
8621,GREAT DEEDS IN BATTLE.,"Blind to the deed that was in hand, thankless for safety won,"
