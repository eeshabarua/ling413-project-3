213,SECTION I.,
214,SECTION I.,
215,SECTION I.,"On the Rākshasas having been slain, all the ascetics, for the purpose of"
216,SECTION I.,"congratulating Rāghava, came to Rāma as he gained (back) his kingdom."
217,SECTION I.,"Kauçika, and Yavakrita, and Gārgya, and Gālava, and Kanva—son unto"
218,SECTION I.,"Mādhālithi,—who dwelt in the east, (came thither); and the reverend"
219,SECTION I.,"Swastyāstreya, and Namuchi, and Pramuchi, and Agastya, and the"
220,SECTION I.,"worshipful Atri, and Sumukha, and Vimukha,—who dwelt in the south,—came"
221,SECTION I.,"in company with Agastya.¹ And Nrishadgu, and Kahashi, and Dhaumya, and"
222,SECTION I.,"that mighty sage—Kauçeya—who abode in the western quarter, came there"
223,SECTION I.,accompanied by their disciples. And Vasishtha and Kaçyapa and Atri and
224,SECTION I.,Viçwamitra with Gautama and Jamadagni and Bharadwaja and also the seven
225,SECTION I.,"sages,² who for aye resided in the northern quarter, (came there). And"
226,SECTION I.,"on arriving at the residence of Rāghava, those high-souled ones,"
227,SECTION I.,"resembling the fire in radiance, stopped at the gate, with the intention"
228,SECTION I.,of communicating their arrival (to Rāma) through the warder. And that
229,SECTION I.,foremost of ascetics—the righteous Agastya—versed in various branches of
230,SECTION I.,"learning and cognizant of the Vedas along with their branches,—addressed"
231,SECTION I.,"the warder, saying,—""Do thou say unto Daçaratha’s son that we—the"
232,SECTION I.,"sages—have come (here)."" Then at the words of Agastya, the gate-keeper"
233,SECTION I.,quick³ and swift presented himself with celerity before the high-souled
234,SECTION I.,"Rāghava. And that one versed in polity and emotional expressions, of"
235,SECTION I.,"worthy ways, possessed of ability and endowed with patience, swiftly"
236,SECTION I.,"seeing Rāma resembling the full moon in brightness, communicated unto"
237,SECTION I.,him the arrival of that supreme of saints—Agastya. Hearing of the
238,SECTION I.,"arrival of the anchorets, possessed of the effulgence of the sun"
239,SECTION I.,"new-risen, he answered the warder, saying,—""Do thou usher them in,"
240,SECTION I.,"having regard to their comfort."" And seeing the ascetics before him,"
241,SECTION I.,"Rāma with joined hands worshipped their feet with _arghyas_, and with"
242,SECTION I.,"regard consecrated a cow unto each, and saluting them with a collected"
243,SECTION I.,"mind, he ordered seats (for the saints). And having, according to their"
244,SECTION I.,"rank, seated themselves on gorgeous and superb seats of Kuça or"
245,SECTION I.,"deer-skins embroidered with gold, those foremost of sages—those mighty"
246,SECTION I.,"saints, versed in the Vedas,—along with their disciples and leaders,"
247,SECTION I.,"having (previously) been asked as to their welfare, addressed Rāma,"
248,SECTION I.,"saying,—""O son of Raghu. O mighty-armed one, complete welfare is ours."
249,SECTION I.,"By good luck it is that we see thee fortunate, with all thy foes"
250,SECTION I.,"finished. By good luck it is that, O king, Rāvana—destroyer of"
251,SECTION I.,"creatures—hath been slain by thee. Sure, O Rāma, it was no great matter"
252,SECTION I.,for thee (to slay) Rāvana along with his sons and grandsons. Furnished
253,SECTION I.,"with thy bow, thou canst, without doubt, destroy the three worlds"
254,SECTION I.,"themselves. By good fortune it is, O Rāma, that Rāvana along with his"
255,SECTION I.,sons and grandsons hath been slain by thee. By good fortune it is that
256,SECTION I.,"to-day we see thee victorious along with Sitā, and, O righteous-souled"
257,SECTION I.,"one, with thy brother, Lakshmana, (ever) compassing thy profit. (By good"
258,SECTION I.,"fortune it is) that, O king, to-day we behold (thee) in company with thy"
259,SECTION I.,mothers and thy brothers. By good fortune it is that those
260,SECTION I.,"night-rangers, Prahasta, and Vikata, and Virupāksha, and Mahodara, and"
261,SECTION I.,"the unconquerable Akampana, have all been slain (by thee). By good"
262,SECTION I.,"fortune it is, O Rāma, that he than whose proportions there are no"
263,SECTION I.,"other’s greater on earth,—even Kumbhakarna, was brought down (by thee)."
264,SECTION I.,"By good luck it is, O Rāma, that those highly powerful night-rangers."
265,SECTION I.,"Triçiras and Atikāya and Devāntaka and Narāntaka, have been slain by"
266,SECTION I.,thee. By good luck it is that thou hadst been encountered in a
267,SECTION I.,"hand-to-hand combat with that foremost of Rākshasas, incapable of being"
268,SECTION I.,slain by the celestials themselves; and achieved victory (ultimately).
269,SECTION I.,To defeat Rāvana in battle was (for thee) a small matter; but it is a
270,SECTION I.,"piece of good fortune that Rāvana’s son, who had confronted thee for"
271,SECTION I.,"combat, hath been slain (by thee) in battle. By good fortune it is that"
272,SECTION I.,"thou, O mighty-armed one, hadst been liberated from (the bonds of) that"
273,SECTION I.,foe of the celestials whose course resembled that of Time⁴;—and that
274,SECTION I.,"thou also hadst secured victory. Hearing of the destruction of Indrajit,"
275,SECTION I.,we congratulate thee (on thy success). He was incapable of being slain
276,SECTION I.,"by all creatures, and in battle possessed mighty powers of illusion."
277,SECTION I.,"Hearing that Indrajit slain, amazement hath seized us all. Having"
278,SECTION I.,"conferred on us this holy freedom from fear, O Kākutstha, O repressor of"
279,SECTION I.,"enemies, thou through good fortune, wilt grow in victory."" Hearing the"
280,SECTION I.,"speech of the ascetics of sacred souls, Rāma, coming under the influence"
281,SECTION I.,"of a mighty wonder, said with joined hands,—""Ye worshipful ones,"
282,SECTION I.,"wherefore, passing by those exceedingly powerful ones Kumbhakarna and"
283,SECTION I.,"the night-ranger, Rāvana—do ye praise Rāvana’s son? Wherefore, passing"
284,SECTION I.,"by Mahodara, and Prahasta, and the Rākshasa—Virupaksha—and Matta, and"
285,SECTION I.,"Unmatta, and the irrepressible Devāntaka and Narāntaka—redoubtable"
286,SECTION I.,"heroes all—do ye extoll Rāvana’s son? And wherefore, passing by Atikāya"
287,SECTION I.,"and Triçiras and Dhumrāksha,—that night-ranger—all endowed with"
288,SECTION I.,"exceeding prowess,—do you extoll Rāvana’s son? What was his prowess? And"
289,SECTION I.,what his strength? And what his might? And by virtue of what cause did
290,SECTION I.,"he surpass Rāvana? If I can well hear the same, (do ye tell it me). I by"
291,SECTION I.,"no means command you. If the thing can bear disclosure, I would hear it."
292,SECTION I.,"Pray, speak out. How was Sakra vanquished by him, and how also did he"
293,SECTION I.,"obtain the boon? And how was the son powerful,—and not his sire—Rāvana?"
294,SECTION I.,"How could that Rākshasa, surpassing his sire, conquer Sakra in mighty"
295,SECTION I.,"encounter, and how did he obtain the boon? O foremost of anchorets, do"
296,SECTION I.,"thou to-day unfold all this unto me, who ask (for the same)."""

298,SECTION I.,¹ The name of Agastya had before been just specified among the
299,SECTION I.,incomers; but so it is in the text.—T.

301,SECTION I.,"² _Ursa Major_, or the great bear, the seven stars of which are the"
302,SECTION I.,"souls of as many saints,—Marichi, Atrai, Angiras, Pulastya,"
303,SECTION I.,"Pulaha, Kratu and Vasistha.—T"
304,SECTION I.,
305,SECTION I.,"³ _Turnam_—according to the commentator, is _mental celerity_, and"
306,SECTION I.,"_drutam—physical_. This distinction, however, is seldom, if ever,"
307,SECTION I.,observed by Sanskrit authors.—T.

315,SECTION II.,
316,SECTION II.,"Hearing those words of his, the exceedingly energetic Kumbhayoni spoke"
317,SECTION II.,"as follows,—""Having regard to his (Indrajit’s) energy and might, I shall"
318,SECTION II.,"relate unto thee the history of his race, in the light of which thou"
319,SECTION II.,"wilt perceive why Rāvana’s son had been capable of slaying his enemies,"
320,SECTION II.,"but could not himself be slain by them. I shall, O Rāghava, describe"
321,SECTION II.,"unto thee Rāvana’s race and birth, as well as the boon that had been"
322,SECTION II.,conferred on him.
323,SECTION II.,
324,SECTION II.,"""Formerly in the Krita age, O Rāma, there was a Brahmarshi—lord (of"
325,SECTION II.,"creatures)—son unto Prajāpati, and like unto the very self of the"
326,SECTION II.,"great-father. His virtues, springing from righteousness and excellency"
327,SECTION II.,"of character, are past all delineation; I can only say that, forsooth,"
328,SECTION II.,he went by the name of Prajāpati’s son. Verily on account of his being
329,SECTION II.,"the son of Prajāpati, he was the darling of the deities; as by virtue of"
330,SECTION II.,"his spotless perfections, that magnanimous one was loved of all"
331,SECTION II.,"creatures. And on a religious mission that foremost of ascetics,"
332,SECTION II.,repairing to the asylum of Trinavindu at the side of the mighty
333,SECTION II.,"mountain, Meru, took up his abode there. And with his senses centered on"
334,SECTION II.,"the study of the Vedas, that righteous-souled one, going to the"
335,SECTION II.,"hermitage, carried on austerities; but his religious rites were"
336,SECTION II.,disturbed by certain girls. And daughters of sages and Pannagas and
337,SECTION II.,"those of Rājarshis,—as well as those of Apsarās, sporting, arrived at"
338,SECTION II.,that quarter. And on account of every season being genial at that spot
339,SECTION II.,"and also of the loveliness of the wood, the damsels, repairing to this"
340,SECTION II.,"place, ever disport there. And on account of the beauty of that region,"
341,SECTION II.,"those wenches, coming to where that twice-born one, Pulastya was, used"
342,SECTION II.,"to sing, to play on instruments, and to dance; and thus those blameless"
343,SECTION II.,beauties disturbed the rites of that anchoret practising austerities.
344,SECTION II.,"Thereat, the mighty ascetic, waxing wroth, said,—’She that comes within"
345,SECTION II.,"my kin, shall conceive.’ Hearing the words of the high-souled one, (the"
346,SECTION II.,"damsels), afraid of a Brāhmana’s curse, ceased to haunt that place. But"
347,SECTION II.,"Trinavindu’s daughter had not heard anything of all this; and, going to"
348,SECTION II.,"the asylum, she ranged it fearlessly. And she did not see there any of"
349,SECTION II.,her associates come to that spot. And at that time that exceedingly
350,SECTION II.,"energetic and mighty sage, Prajāpati’s son, with his soul sanctified"
351,SECTION II.,"through asceticism, was engaged in the study of the Veda. And, hearing"
352,SECTION II.,"the sounds of Vaidika recitation, and seeing that storehouse of"
353,SECTION II.,"asceticism, she had her body turned pale, and signs of pregnancy"

702,SECTION VI.,"Kaparddi of red-blue hue, reflecting that it would be wrong for him to"

708,SECTION VI.,"_Jaya_, (the celestials) afflicted with the fear of the night-rangers,"
709,SECTION VI.,presented themselves before Vishnu. And bowing down unto the god holding

723,SECTION VI.,"of ours."" Thus accosted by the deities, that god of gods—Janārddana—who"
724,SECTION VI.,"bringeth fear unto foes—cheering up the celestials, said unto them,—""I"
725,SECTION VI.,"know the Rākshasa, Sukeça, as flushed with the boon bestowed by Içāna."
726,SECTION VI.,"And I also know his sons, of whom Malyavān is the eldest. Those worst of"

750,SECTION VI.,"celestials with Indra at their head,—I will slay those foes of the"
751,SECTION VI.,"celestials. Ye gods, cast off all fear!—O foremost of Rākshasas, Hari"
752,SECTION VI.,promised unto the frightened celestials that he would slay us. Therefore
753,SECTION VI.,do ye think as to what is fit. Hiranyakaçipu hath met with death (at the
754,SECTION VI.,"hands of Hari), as also other enemies of the immortals. And Namuchi and"
755,SECTION VI.,"Kālanemi, and that foremost of heroes,—Sanhrāda—and Rādheya, and"
756,SECTION VI.,"Vahumāyi, and the virtuous Lokapāla, and Yāmala, and Arjuna, and"
757,SECTION VI.,"Hārdikya, and Sumbha and Niçumbhaka,—Asuras and Dānavas endowed with"
758,SECTION VI.,"strength and possessed of terrific prowess—all these, who, having come"
759,SECTION VI.,"to the field, had never been heard of as worsted, who had performed"
760,SECTION VI.,"hundreds of sacrifices, who had been well skilled in illusion, who had"
761,SECTION VI.,"been versed in every branch of knowledge, and who were the terrors of"
762,SECTION VI.,their foes—have by hundreds and by thousands been destroyed by Nārāyana.
763,SECTION VI.,"Learning this, it behoveth you to do what would conduce to the behoof of"
764,SECTION VI.,"all. It is a sore task to defeat Nārāyana, who wisheth to slay us.’"
765,SECTION VI.,"Thereat Sumāli and Māli, hearing the words of Mālyavān, said unto their"
766,SECTION VI.,"eldest brother, like the Acwins addressing Vāsava,—’We have studied,"
767,SECTION VI.,"performed sacrifices, practised charity, and obtained riches; and"
768,SECTION VI.,"attaining long health and long life, we have established sterling"
769,SECTION VI.,righteousness in our path. And with arms plunging into the sea of
770,SECTION VI.,"celestials, we have conquered our unrivalled enemies. Therefore, we have"
771,SECTION VI.,"no fear touching death. Even Nārāyana and Rudra, Sakra and Yama, ever"
772,SECTION VI.,"fear to stay before us (in the field). And, O lord of Rākshasas, there"
773,SECTION VI.,is no occasion for Vishnu’s displeasure of us. The mind of Vishnu hath
774,SECTION VI.,wavered in consequence of the evil caused by the celestials. Therefore
775,SECTION VI.,"will we even avenge ourselves on the gods, from whom hath sprung this"
776,SECTION VI.,"wrong.’ Having taken counsel together, those powerful ones conciliated"
777,SECTION VI.,their forces. And proclaiming (their order) that preparations were to be
778,SECTION VI.,"made, all the foremost Nairitas sallied forth for battle, like unto"
779,SECTION VI.,"those led by Jamva and Vritra. And, O Rāma, having thus taken counsel"
780,SECTION VI.,"together, with all the preparations complete, those huge-bodied and"
781,SECTION VI.,"redoubtable Rakshas marched forth for conflict, mounted on cars, and"
782,SECTION VI.,"elephants, and horses resembling elephants, and mules, and kine, and"
783,SECTION VI.,"camels, and purpoises,¹⁸ and serpents, _makaras_, and tortoises, and"

785,SECTION VI.,"and _Srimaras_¹⁹ and _Chāmaras_.²⁰ And puffed up with pride of prowess,"
786,SECTION VI.,"the Rakshas march, leaving Lankā, and the enemies of the celestials went"
787,SECTION VI.,to the heavenly regions for battle. And perceiving the destruction of
788,SECTION VI.,"Lankā at hand, those deities that had taken up their quarters there,"
789,SECTION VI.,everywhere were struck with fear and felt their spirits depressed. And
790,SECTION VI.,"mounting the best of cars, the Rākshasas by hundreds and thousands with"
791,SECTION VI.,intent minds swiftly sallied forth for the celestial regions. And the
792,SECTION VI.,deities (aforementioned) followed the tract of the Rākshasas. And at the
793,SECTION VI.,"command of Kāla, terrible evil omens foreshadowing the destruction of"
794,SECTION VI.,the Rākshasa-chiefs began to arise on the earth well as in the sky. The
795,SECTION VI.,clouds showered down bones and hot blood. The oceans overleapt their
796,SECTION VI.,"continents;²¹ and the mountains shook. And jackals of terrific forms,"
797,SECTION VI.,"having voices resembling the roaring of clouds,—bursting out into a"
798,SECTION VI.,"horse-laugh, began to emit cries frightfully. Creatures were one after"
799,SECTION VI.,"another seen to drop down; and mighty swarms of vultures, with mouths"
800,SECTION VI.,"belching forth flames, began to wheel over the Rākshasa, like unto Kāla"
801,SECTION VI.,himself. And blood-footed pigeons and Sārikās²² darted off (around). And
802,SECTION VI.,crows and two-legged cats began to cry in loud accents. But fast bound
803,SECTION VI.,"with the noose of Death, the Rākshasas, proud of their strength,"
804,SECTION VI.,"disregarding these omens, march on, and do not stay their"
805,SECTION VI.,"course,—Mālyavān and Sumāli possessed of prodigious strength, going"
806,SECTION VI.,"before the Rākshasas, like flaming fires. And even as the gods take"
807,SECTION VI.,"refuge under Dhata, the night-rangers take refuge under Malyavān"
808,SECTION VI.,"resembling the mountain, Malyavān. And under the command of Māli, that"
809,SECTION VI.,"host of Rākshasas, roaring like mighty clouds, inspired with the desire"
810,SECTION VI.,"of victory, went to the celestial regions. And the lord Nārāyana,"
811,SECTION VI.,"hearing of the preparations of the Rākshasas from a celestial messenger,"
812,SECTION VI.,"set his heart on fight. And equipped with weapons and quivers, he"
813,SECTION VI.,mounted on Vinata’s offspring.²³ And donning on his mail furnished with
814,SECTION VI.,"the effulgence of a thousand suns, fastening his spotless quivers filled"
815,SECTION VI.,"with shafts, being engirt with his waist-band and bright falchion, and"
816,SECTION VI.,"equipped with his conch, discus, mace, _Sārnga_,²⁴ sword, and other"
817,SECTION VI.,"superior weapons, that lotus-eyed lord, seated on Vinata’s offspring"
818,SECTION VI.,"like a very mountain, set out speedily for compassing the destruction of"
819,SECTION VI.,"the Rākshasas. And seated on Suparna’s²⁵ back, the blue-brown Hari clad"
820,SECTION VI.,in yellow attire resembled a mass of clouds on the crest of the golden
821,SECTION VI.,"mountain, with lightning playing through it. And hymned by Siddhas and"
822,SECTION VI.,celestials and sages and mighty (semi-divine) serpents and Gandharvas
823,SECTION VI.,"and Yakhas, the enemy of the Asura hosts presented himself, bearing in"
824,SECTION VI.,"his hands the discus, sword, that weapon—_Sārnga_—and the conch. And the"
825,SECTION VI.,"Rākshasa-hosts, struck by the wind produced by the wings of Suparna,"
826,SECTION VI.,with their pennons swinging to and fro and their weapons scattered
827,SECTION VI.,"about, quaked like the blue summit of a mountain with its crags tossed"

879,SECTION VII.,"the fishes (residing in it), that invincible one, taking his _Sārnga_,"
880,SECTION VII.,showered shafts among the Rākshasas. And with sharpened arrows

882,SECTION VII.,"from his bow drawn to its fullest stretch, Vishnu cut off (Rākshasas) by"

884,SECTION VII.,"his arrowy shower, even as the wind aroused dasheth away a downpour,"
885,SECTION VII.,that best of male beings blew his mighty conch—Pānchajanya. And winded
886,SECTION VII.,"by Hari with his utmost might, that water-sprung king of conchs, endowed"
887,SECTION VII.,"with terrific blares, roared, as if afflicting the three worlds. And the"
888,SECTION VII.,"sounds of that king of conchs struck terror into the Rākshasas, even as"

898,SECTION VII.,the persons of the foes inflicted by the discus of Vishnu discharge
899,SECTION VII.,"blood in streams, like mountains discharging streams of red chalk. And"
900,SECTION VII.,"the sounds of that king of conchs, as well as those of the _Sārnga_,"
901,SECTION VII.,"combined with the roars emitted by Vishnu himself, swallowed up the"
902,SECTION VII.,roars of the Rākshasas. And Hari by means of his shafts cut off their
903,SECTION VII.,"necks, and arrows, and standards, and bows, and cars, and ensigns, and"
904,SECTION VII.,"quivers. And like fierce rays streaming about from the sun, like"
905,SECTION VII.,"torrents dashing from the ocean, like elephants coming down a mountain,"

907,SECTION VII.,pursue (the foes) by hundreds and by thousands. And even as an elephant

916,SECTION VII.,been broken in consequence of the beating it got at the hands of
917,SECTION VII.,"Nārāyana, Sumāli with showers of shafts resisted Hari in the encounter;"
918,SECTION VII.,"and as a mist envelopes the Sun, he enveloped him (with his arrows)."
919,SECTION VII.,"Thereat, the Rākshasas again summoned up their fortitude. And fired with"

921,SECTION VII.,"setting up a tremendous roar, darted at his antagonist in the conflict,"
922,SECTION VII.,thereby seeming to revive the Rākshasas. And as an elephant flourishes
923,SECTION VII.,"its trunk, that Rākshasa, lifting up his arm adorned with ornaments,"
924,SECTION VII.,"began to roar from rapture, like a mass of clouds lighted up with"
925,SECTION VII.,lightning. And (Vishnu) cut off the head flaming with ear-rings of the
926,SECTION VII.,charioteer of the shouting Sumāli; and thereat the horses of that
927,SECTION VII.,Rākshasa aimlessly strayed hither and thither. And with his bewildered
928,SECTION VII.,"steeds Sumāli wanders like a person deprived of patience, whose senses"

930,SECTION VII.,"his steeds, Māli, taking his bow and equipped therewith, darted at"
931,SECTION VII.,Vishnu’s car and assailed that mighty-armed one as he was descending on
932,SECTION VII.,"the field of fight. And like birds entering the Krauncha,²⁸ the arrows"
933,SECTION VII.,"discharged from Māli’s bow, graced with gold, hit Hari and entered (into"
934,SECTION VII.,"his body). And thereat, as a person holding his senses under subjection"
935,SECTION VII.,"is not thrown out of his mental balance, Vishnu, assailed in that"
936,SECTION VII.,"encounter with thousands of arrows shot by Māli, was not disturbed ever"
937,SECTION VII.,"so little. And then that creator of all beings, the reverend"
938,SECTION VII.,"Gadādhara,²⁹ twanging his bow-string, showered vollies of shafts on"
939,SECTION VII.,"Māli. And getting at Māli’s body, the arrows furnished with the"
940,SECTION VII.,"luminousness of lightning, drink his blood, like unto serpents drinking"
941,SECTION VII.,"nectar. And baffling Māli, the holder of the conch, discus, and mace,"
942,SECTION VII.,"brought down Māli’s crown, standard, bow and steeds. And then that"
943,SECTION VII.,"foremost of night-rangers, on being deprived of his car, sprang forward,"
944,SECTION VII.,"mace in hand, even as a lion bounds up from the brow of a hillock. And"
945,SECTION VII.,"he with his mace smote at the forehead of that lord of birds, even as"
946,SECTION VII.,"the Destroyer had smitten Içāna,³⁰ or as Indra smiteth a mountain with"
947,SECTION VII.,"his thunder-bolt. On being severely struck by Māli with his mace,"
948,SECTION VII.,"Garuda, writhing in torments, moved the god away from the field of"
949,SECTION VII.,battle. On the god having been removed from the field by Māli as well as
950,SECTION VII.,"Garuda, there arose a mighty din of Rakshas roaring (in chorus). And"
951,SECTION VII.,"hearing the cheers of the Rakshas, Indra’s younger brother, the reverend"
952,SECTION VII.,"Hari, sitting awry on that lord of birds, albeit moved off from the"
953,SECTION VII.,"scene of conflict, waxing enraged, from a desire of slaying (Māli)"
954,SECTION VII.,"hurled his disc at him. And thereat the disc, possessed of the splendour"
955,SECTION VII.,"of the solar disc, and resembling the wheel³¹ itself of Kāla, flooding"
956,SECTION VII.,"all the heavens with radiance, brought down Māli’s head to the ground."
957,SECTION VII.,"And that head of the lord of Rākshasas, terrific to behold, on being cut"
958,SECTION VII.,"off (by Vishnu), vomitting blood, fell down before (the Rākshasas), as"
959,SECTION VII.,formerly Rāhu’s head’ had fallen. And then the deities experiencing
960,SECTION VII.,"excess of joy set up leonine cheers with might and main,"
961,SECTION VII.,"crying,—’Excellent, O god.’ Seeing Māli slain, Sumāli and Malyavān,"
962,SECTION VII.,"burning in grief, fled precipitately towards Lankā along with their"
963,SECTION VII.,"forces. And Garuda, being cheered, turned round, and growing enraged, as"
964,SECTION VII.,before drove the Rākshasas with the wind of his wings. And (some) with
965,SECTION VII.,"their lotus-faces cut by the discus, (some) with their chests crushed"
966,SECTION VII.,"with the mace, (some) with their necks torn off by the plough, (some)"
967,SECTION VII.,"with their heads riven by the club, and some hewn by the sword, and"
968,SECTION VII.,"others pierced by arrows, the Rākshasas began to drop fast from the sky"
969,SECTION VII.,into the waters of the ocean. And as the thunder-bolt with lightning
970,SECTION VII.,"(riveth) a mighty mass of clouds, Nārāyana by means of the thunder-bolts"
971,SECTION VII.,"of his arrows discharged from his bow, rived the night-rangers with"
972,SECTION VII.,their hair dishevelled and streaming (in the wind). And the forces
973,SECTION VII.,"having their umbrellas rent, their arms falling off, their goodly"
974,SECTION VII.,"garments scattered, their entrails coming out and their eyes"
975,SECTION VII.,"rolling,—became incapable of distinguishing their own party from that of"
976,SECTION VII.,the foe. And even like (the roars and the vehemence) displayed by
977,SECTION VII.,"elephants on being attacked by lions, the roars and the vehemence of the"
978,SECTION VII.,"night-rangers and their elephants, sore assailed by the Primaeval"
979,SECTION VII.,"Lion,³² were equal. And driven by Hari’s networks of arrows, and"
980,SECTION VII.,"discharging (all the while) their own showers of shafts, those"
981,SECTION VII.,"night-rangers resembling the clouds of doom, are driven like the"
982,SECTION VII.,veritable clouds of the universal dissolution drifted by the wind. And
983,SECTION VII.,"hewn in twain with swords, the foremost Rākshasas fell like unto hills"
984,SECTION VII.,(toppling headlong). And the Earth was seen to be (covered) with

1033,SECTION VIII.,"speaking thus, the lord of Rākshasas in high wrath pierced his breast"
1034,SECTION VIII.,"with a dart. And hurled by the hand of Mālyavān, the dart resonant with"

1040,SECTION VIII.,"towards the Rākshasa like a meteor coursing towards the Anjana mountain,"
1041,SECTION VIII.,descended on the spacious chest of the lord of Rākshasas decked with the
1042,SECTION VIII.,"weight of a chain, even as the thunder-clap bursts at the summit of a"

1047,SECTION VIII.,"night-ranger delighting in battle, dealing a box at Vāsava’s younger"

1049,SECTION VIII.,there arose a mighty tumult in the sky of ’Excellent!’ ’Excellent!’ And
1050,SECTION VIII.,"having struck Vishnu, the Rākshasa also hit Garuda. Thereat Vinatā’s"
1051,SECTION VIII.,"son, growing enraged, drove the Rākshasas away with the wind of his"
1052,SECTION VIII.,"wings, even as a lusty wind bloweth about sere leaves. And seeing his"

1150,SECTION IX.,"necks, furnished with large teeth, and resembling a heap of collyrium,"
1151,SECTION IX.,"with coppery lips, twenty arms, huge faces, and flaming hair. On his"
1152,SECTION IX.,"having been born, jackals with flaming mouths and other ferocious beasts"
1153,SECTION IX.,began to gyrate on the left. And that god showered down blood; and the
1154,SECTION IX.,clouds uttered forth harsh sounds. And the Sun was deprived of his
1155,SECTION IX.,splendour; and meteors began to dart to the earth. And the earth shook;
1156,SECTION IX.,"and the wind swept away violently. And that lord of streams—the ocean,"
1157,SECTION IX.,"which was calm before, became agitated. And his sire resembling his"
1158,SECTION IX.,"grand-father named him, (saying),—’As this one hath been born with ten"

1173,SECTION IX.,"pass that after a length of time the god, Vaiçravana—lord of riches—came"

1178,SECTION IX.,"Therefore, O Ten-necked one, O thou of measureless prowess, do thou so"

1339,SECTION XI.,"Then the Ten-necked one addressed his maternal grand-father, who was"

1346,SECTION XI.,to speak thus. Fraternal feeling there is none among heroes. Listen to

1349,SECTION XI.,became the wives of that lord of creatures—Kaçyapa. And Aditi brought
1350,SECTION XI.,"forth the gods,—who are the lords of the three worlds. And Diti gave"

1354,SECTION XI.,(gradually) they grew very powerful. And then this undeteriorating
1355,SECTION XI.,triune world was brought under the dominion of the celestials. So that
1356,SECTION XI.,thou art not the only one that would act inimically (to thy brother);
1357,SECTION XI.,but this course had formerly been pursued by both the celestials and the
1358,SECTION XI.,Asuras. Therefore do thou act in conformity with my word.’ Thus
1359,SECTION XI.,"exhorted, the Ten-necked one, with a delighted heart, reflecting for a"
1360,SECTION XI.,"moment, said, ‘Very well.’ And wrought up with delight, the Ten-necked"
1361,SECTION XI.,"one endowed with prowess the very same day went to the forest,"
1362,SECTION XI.,"accompanied by the night-rangers. And arriving at Trikuta, that one"
1363,SECTION XI.,"skilled in speech—the night-ranger, Rāvana—sent Prahasta in the capacity"
1364,SECTION XI.,"of an ambassador: ‘O Prahasta, hie thee; and tell the foremost of"

1392,SECTION XI.,"accosted, that foremost of ascetics, the Brahmarshi—Viçrava—spoke unto"
1393,SECTION XI.,"the lord of riches (standing) with joined hands,—‘O son, listen to my"

1395,SECTION XI.,(to that effect). Thereat I greatly rebuked that wicked-minded one; and
1396,SECTION XI.,"I said again and again in anger,—Thou disregardest (thy religion and"

1398,SECTION XI.,"a wicked heart, thou, with thy understanding spoilt in consequence of"
1399,SECTION XI.,"the granting of the boon, canst not distinguish between those deserving"
1400,SECTION XI.,"honor and those not; and, further, through my curse, thou hast come by a"

1443,SECTION XII.,mayst ere this have heard of an Apsarā named Hemā. She like unto the
1444,SECTION XII.,Paulomi of Satakratu was bestowed on me by the gods. And I passed a

1446,SECTION XII.,"since she had gone on a business of the celestials, as also the"

1449,SECTION XII.,"aggrieved and sorrowful on account of her separation. From thence,"
1450,SECTION XII.,"taking my daughter, I have come to this wood. This, O king, is my"

1622,SECTION XIV.,"assailed, Daçānana was deprived of his movements with vollies of weapons"

1628,SECTION XIV.,abode of Yama. And as a flaming fire burneth up an extensive sward of

1688,SECTION XV.,"slain by Mahodara. And O king, in the twinkling of an eye Māricha,"
1689,SECTION XV.,waxing wroth and eager for encounter brought down two thousand (of

1693,SECTION XV.,"And Dhumrācksha, confronting Mānibhadra in the mighty conflict hit him"
1694,SECTION XV.,at the chest with a bludgeon; but he did not move thereat. And then

1697,SECTION XV.,"seeing Dhumrāckhsa wounded and down, bathed in blood, the Ten-necked one"
1698,SECTION XV.,rushed at Mānibhadra in the encounter. And then that foremost of Yakshas
1699,SECTION XV.,hit Daçānana with three darts as he was rushing in wrath. And on being
1700,SECTION XV.,"thus hit, (Rāvana) struck at Mānibhadra’s head; and at that stroke his"

1707,SECTION XV.,"obscured through the curse (he had ere this come by), the intelligent"
1708,SECTION XV.,(lord of Yakshas) spoke in words worthy of the line of his

1730,SECTION XV.,"Yaksha and Rākshasa, smiting each other in mighty encounter, did not get"

1903,SECTION XVII.,"Having made this promise, I have been carrying on rigid austerities."

1905,SECTION XVII.,"Nārāyana is my husband, and not any one else than that best of male"

1909,SECTION XVII.,"Thereat descending from the front of his car, Rāvana, afflicted with the"
1910,SECTION XVII.,"shafts of Kandarpa, again addressed that girl, observant of a mighty"
1911,SECTION XVII.,"vow, ’O thou of shapely hips, in as much as such is thy intent, thou"

1918,SECTION XVII.,"in prowess, nor in asceticism, nor in enjoyment, nor in strength, is he"

1925,SECTION XVII.,"hand transformed into a sword. And then, flaming up in ire and as if"
1926,SECTION XVII.,"consuming the night-ranger, she, preparing a funeral pyre, hastened to"
1927,SECTION XVII.,"make away with herself. ’Thou abject, having been outraged by thee I"
1928,SECTION XVII.,"wish not to live. Therefore, O Raksha, I will enter into fire in thy"
1929,SECTION XVII.,very presence. And as I have in this world been dishonored by thee thou
1930,SECTION XVII.,art nefarious. I shall again be born to compass thy destruction. It
1931,SECTION XVII.,lieth not in a female to slay a male intent on sin; and if I utter a

1978,SECTION XVIII.,"Then taking up his bow and arrows, that king of men went out for"

1995,SECTION XVIII.,"peacock,—’Pleased am I with thee thou righteous one. No fear shall"
1996,SECTION XVIII.,spring to thee from serpents; and thy plumage shall be furnished with an
1997,SECTION XVIII.,"hundred eyes. And when I shall shower, thou shalt be filled with glee as"

2218,SECTION XX.,Rāvana also saw some in front of houses engaged in merry-making with

2225,SECTION XX.,that mighty one delivered those that were being tormented by their
2226,SECTION XX.,"wicked acts. And on being liberated by that Raksha—the ten-necked one,"
2227,SECTION XX.,"those creatures in a moment began to enjoy their release, that had come"
2228,SECTION XX.,to them without thought or suspense. And on the dead being delivered by
2229,SECTION XX.,"the magnanimous Rākshasa, the guards of the dead, getting enraged,"
2230,SECTION XX.,rushed at the Rākshasa sovereign. And there arose a mighty tumult from
2231,SECTION XX.,all sides; from the heroic warriors of the king of righteousness rushing
2232,SECTION XX.,(all around.) And those heroes by hundreds and by thousands assailed
2233,SECTION XX.,"(Pushpaka) with _prāças_, and bludgeons, and darts and maces, and spears"
2234,SECTION XX.,"and _tomaras_. And swiftly swarming like bees, they began to break the"
2235,SECTION XX.,"seats, blocks, daises and gateways (of the car.) And in that conflict"
2236,SECTION XX.,"Pushpaka presided over by divine energy, incapable of being destroyed by"
2237,SECTION XX.,"virtue of Brahmā power, being broken, resumed its former shape."
2238,SECTION XX.,Countless were the soldiers of that high-souled one consisting hundreds
2239,SECTION XX.,"and thousands of heroic warriors, (ever) forward for fight. And"
2240,SECTION XX.,according to the measure of their might his (Rāvana’s) councillors—great
2241,SECTION XX.,"heroes all, as well as the ten-faced one himself with might and main,"
2242,SECTION XX.,fought with trees and crags and hundreds of blocks of buildings. And
2243,SECTION XX.,"those councillors of the lord of Rākshasas, assailed with every kind of"
2244,SECTION XX.,"weapons, with their persons bathed in blood, fought fiercely. And O"
2245,SECTION XX.,large-armed one the exalted councillors of Yama and Rāvana sore assailed
2246,SECTION XX.,each other with arms. And leaving the councillors alone the highly
2247,SECTION XX.,powerful warriors of Yama rushed against Daçānana⁵⁶ with a shower of
2248,SECTION XX.,"spears. And then pierced through and through by those weapons, with his"
2249,SECTION XX.,"person covered with blood, the Rākshasa king appeared like a flowering"
2250,SECTION XX.,"Kinçuka in Pushpaka.⁵⁷ And thereat that powerful one, by virtue of his"
2251,SECTION XX.,"mastery over weapons, began to hurl darts and maces, _prāças_ and spears"
2252,SECTION XX.,"and _tomaras_ and crags and trees. And that terrific shower of trees,"
2253,SECTION XX.,"rocks and arms, alighted on the army of Yama (fighting) on the earth."
2254,SECTION XX.,"And snapping those weapons and resisting (those vollies of) arms, they"
2255,SECTION XX.,smote at the Rākshasa fighting alone by hundreds and thousands. And
2256,SECTION XX.,"encompassing him even as clouds encompass a mountain, they rendered"
2257,SECTION XX.,(Rāvana) inert by means of _Bhindipālas_ and darts. And with his mail
2258,SECTION XX.,"torn open, his anger raging fiercely, and covered with blood streaming"
2259,SECTION XX.,"over his person, he, forsaking his car, stood upon the ground. And then"
2260,SECTION XX.,"furnished with his bow and holding his shafts, (Rāvana) regaining his"
2261,SECTION XX.,"senses in a short time, increased in energy and stood in the field like"
2262,SECTION XX.,"the finisher. And now fixing the divine Pāçupata on his bow, and saying"
2263,SECTION XX.,"unto them, ’Slay! Slay!’ he drew that bow. And enraged, (Rāvana)"
2264,SECTION XX.,"resembling Rudra himself, in fight drawing his bow to his car,"
2265,SECTION XX.,discharged that shaft even as Sankara had discharged at Tripura. And the
2266,SECTION XX.,appearance of the shaft was like an extinguishing fire in summer with
2267,SECTION XX.,"smoke with flames, burning up a forest. And garlanded with glory that"
2268,SECTION XX.,"shaft followed by ghosts,⁵⁸ in that encounter; rushed on, burning to"
2269,SECTION XX.,ashes the loose bushes and trees lying in its way. And burnt up by its
2270,SECTION XX.,"energy, the most of Vaivaswata fell down in the field like unto banners"
2271,SECTION XX.,of Mahendra. And thereat the Rākshasa of terrific prowess along with his
2272,SECTION XX.,councillors began to set up tremendous shouts; as if making the earth

2310,SECTION XXII.,beside (him) was the rod of Time in its native from—the divine
2311,SECTION XXII.,instrument of Yama like unto a flaming fire on account of its own

2314,SECTION XXII.,took the denizens of heaven. And the charioteer urged on the steeds
2315,SECTION XXII.,possessed of graceful splendour; and arrived where the lord of Rākshasas
2316,SECTION XXII.,was posted. And in a moment those horses like unto thought (in
2317,SECTION XXII.,"celerity,) and resembling the steeds themselves of Hari, took Yama where"

2320,SECTION XXII.,at once took to their heels. And in consequence of their being
2321,SECTION XXII.,comparatively inferior in point of strength they were deprived of their
2322,SECTION XXII.,"senses, and afflicted with fear; and saying, ’Here we are not equal to"

2330,SECTION XXII.,"could not resist, (Yama’s arms) with hundreds of mighty darts hurled."
2331,SECTION XXII.,And in this way that destroyer of foes—Yama fought for seven nights with
2332,SECTION XXII.,various arms; until at length his enemy was driven back and deprived of

2335,SECTION XXII.,"And celestials and Gandharvas and Siddhas, and the supreme saints,"

2337,SECTION XXII.,the encounter that then took place between that foremost of of Rākshasas
2338,SECTION XXII.,and the lord of the Dead was like the universal upheaval. And stretching
2339,SECTION XXII.,"his bow resembling in spleandour the thunderbolt of Indra, he discharged"
2340,SECTION XXII.,"arrows covering up the sky. And he smote Death with four, the (Yama’s)"
2341,SECTION XXII.,"charioteer with seven, and swiftly struck Yama in the marrow with"
2342,SECTION XXII.,hundreds and thousands of shafts. And then from forth Yama’s mouth there
2343,SECTION XXII.,"issued darted flames with his teeth mixed with smoke, the fire of his"
2344,SECTION XXII.,fury. And witnessing this wonder in the presence of the deities and
2345,SECTION XXII.,"Dānavas, both Death and Time were fired with wrath and were filled with"
2346,SECTION XXII.,"delight. And the Death, growing still more wroth, addressed Vaivaswata"

2358,SECTION XXII.,"thou cognizant of righteousness,—I shall slay this one. There is none"
2359,SECTION XXII.,"that, albeit strong, can survive after having been seen by me. Verily"
2360,SECTION XXII.,"this is not mine strength,—this might pertaineth to me by nature. O"
2361,SECTION XXII.,"Time, if seen by me, he won’t live for a moment.’ Hearing these words of"
2362,SECTION XXII.,"his, the puissant king of righteousness spake there unto death,—’Do thou"
2363,SECTION XXII.,"stay. I myself shall slay him.’ Then with his eyes reddened that lord,"
2364,SECTION XXII.,"Vaivaswata, wielded with his hand the infallible dart of time; while by"

2367,SECTION XXII.,"away the lives of creatures,—what should be said of its touching and"
2368,SECTION XXII.,"being hurled at people? And touched by that powerful one, that mighty"
2369,SECTION XXII.,"weapon, _engist_ with flames, attained access of energy, and seemed to"
2370,SECTION XXII.,"consume the Rākshasa. And in the field of battle, every one afflicted"
2371,SECTION XXII.,"with fear, ran away from it. And beholding Yama with his rod uplifted,"
2372,SECTION XXII.,the celestials were agitated. And on Yama being desirous of slaying
2373,SECTION XXII.,"Rāvana, the great-father manifesting himself spake unto Yama: ’O"
2374,SECTION XXII.,"Vaivaswata, O mighty-armed one, O thou of immeasurable prowess, this"
2375,SECTION XXII.,certainly must not be; Thou shouldst not with thy rod slay the

2377,SECTION XXII.,him; and thou shouldst not render false the words that I have uttered.
2378,SECTION XXII.,"Verily he, that, whether a god or a human being, shall falsify my words,"
2379,SECTION XXII.,shall render this triune universe false. There is no doubt about this.
2380,SECTION XXII.,"If this terrific weapon, capable of affrighting the three spheres, be"
2381,SECTION XXII.,"discharged alike at friends and foes, it will destroy creatures. This"
2382,SECTION XXII.,"rod of time, of immeasurable might and incapable of being resisted by"
2383,SECTION XXII.,"creatures, was created by me as having the power of compassing the death"
2384,SECTION XXII.,"of all beings. Therefore, O mild one, thou forsooth shouldst not bring"
2385,SECTION XXII.,"it down on Rāvana’s head. If this alights on any one, he doth not live"
2386,SECTION XXII.,"for a moment, Whether on this weapon allighting, the ten-necked does not"
2387,SECTION XXII.,"die, or if he does do either way falsehood is the consequence, therefore"
2388,SECTION XXII.,do thou keep thy uplifted weapon off Lankā’s lord. If thou have any care
2389,SECTION XXII.,"for these worlds do thou establish my truth.’ Thus addressed, Yama then"
2390,SECTION XXII.,"answered, ’I restrain this rod. Thou art our Lord. But as I can not slay"
2391,SECTION XXII.,"this one who hath obtained a boon, what then shall I do now in the"
2392,SECTION XXII.,field? Therefore shall I disappear from the sight of this Raksha.’
2393,SECTION XXII.,"Having said this, even there did he vanish with his car and horses. And"
2394,SECTION XXII.,"having vanquished him and distinguished his name, he again ascended his"
2395,SECTION XXII.,Pushpaka and went out of the abode of Yama. And with a delighted heart

2479,SECTION XXIII.,"together with their foremost charioteers, lay low on the earth. And then"
2480,SECTION XXIII.,"forsaking their cars, the sons of the high-souled Varuna, stationed in"

2485,SECTION XXIII.,"resembling thunderbolts and discharged off the bows, pierced him."
2486,SECTION XXIII.,"Thereupon the Ten-necked (demon), excited with wrath like the fire of"

2539,SECTION XXIV.,dreadful in fight. There the Ten-necked demon beheld a highly
2540,SECTION XXIV.,"picturesque house—adorned with networks of pearls, having gateways"
2541,SECTION XXIV.,"crested with Vaidurjas, golden pillars and abounding in pavements. And"
2542,SECTION XXIV.,"the stairs, of that picturesque house resembling the abode of Mahendra,"
2543,SECTION XXIV.,"covered with girdles, were made of crystal. Beholding that excellent"
2544,SECTION XXIV.,boost the highly powerful Rāvana thought within himself—’Whose is this
2545,SECTION XXIV.,"beautiful house, resembling the summit of Meru? Go O Prahasta, and learn"
2546,SECTION XXIV.,"quickly whose house is this.’ Thus ordered, Prahasta entered that"
2547,SECTION XXIV.,excellent house—and finding none in one appartment he entered another
2548,SECTION XXIV.,and thus entering seven apartments he at last saw a flame of fire. There
2549,SECTION XXIV.,"was a man in that flame, who, when seen, laughed aloud. Hearing that"
2550,SECTION XXIV.,dreadful laughter Prahasta’s down stood on their end. There was another
2551,SECTION XXIV.,"man in that flame, as if in a swoon, engarlanded with golden lotuses,"
2552,SECTION XXIV.,"incapable of being looked at, like the sun, and resembling the Yama’s"
2553,SECTION XXIV.,self. Beholding that the night-ranger speedily issued out of the house
2554,SECTION XXIV.,"and communicated it unto Rāvana. Thereupon, O Rāma, having descended"
2555,SECTION XXIV.,"from Pushpaka, the Ten-necked demon, black as collyrium, entered that"
2556,SECTION XXIV.,"house. (Immediately) obstructing the door there stood a huge-bodied man,"
2557,SECTION XXIV.,"dreadful like Siva—his tongue was all flame, his eyes were red, rows of"
2558,SECTION XXIV.,"teeth beautiful, lips like _Bimba_, his form was handsome, nose"
2559,SECTION XXIV.,"dreadful, neck like a shell marked with three lines, jaws were spacious,"
2560,SECTION XXIV.,"beards thick, bone fleshy, teeth huge and his appearance was all"
2561,SECTION XXIV.,dreadful. And taking up an iron mace he stood at the gate. Beholding
2562,SECTION XXIV.,"him, Daçānana’s hairs stood on their end—his heart and body trembled."
2563,SECTION XXIV.,"And seeing these bad omens, O Rāma, he began to think within himself. He"
2564,SECTION XXIV.,"thus meditating that man said—’What art thou thinking, O Rākshasa? Tell"
2565,SECTION XXIV.,me all in confidence. I shall confer upon thee the hospitality of
2566,SECTION XXIV.,"fighting, O hero, O night-ranger.’ Having said this he again spoke unto"
2567,SECTION XXIV.,"Rāvana, saying—’Dost thou wish to enter into conflict with Bali, or what"
2568,SECTION XXIV.,else is thy intention?’ Rāvana was so overwhelmed that his hairs stood
2569,SECTION XXIV.,on their end; but resorting to calmness he said—’O thou foremost of
2570,SECTION XXIV.,"those skilled in speech, who residest in this house? I shall fight with"
2571,SECTION XXIV.,him; speak out what thou wishest.’ He again said (to Rāvana)—’The lord
2572,SECTION XXIV.,"of Dānavas lives here—he is highly generous, heroic, and hath truth for"
2573,SECTION XXIV.,"his prowess. He is gifted with many qualities, resplendent like unto"
2574,SECTION XXIV.,Yama with mace in his hand or the newly risen sun and incapable of being
2575,SECTION XXIV.,"defeated in conflict, impetuous, invincible, victorious, powerful, a"
2576,SECTION XXIV.,"veritable ocean of accomplishments, sweet-speeched, supporter of the"
2577,SECTION XXIV.,"dependants, fond of preceptor and Brahmans, always waiting for opportune"
2578,SECTION XXIV.,"hours, gifted with high powers, truthful, of a handsome person, skilful,"
2579,SECTION XXIV.,"gifted with all accomplishments, heroic and engaged in the study of the"
2580,SECTION XXIV.,Vedas. He sometimes walks on foot and moves about like the wind—he
2581,SECTION XXIV.,shines like fire and spreads heat like the sun. He travels with the
2582,SECTION XXIV.,"gods, spirits, serpents and birds. He does not know fear; dost thou wish"
2583,SECTION XXIV.,"to fight with him? If thou dost wish to fight with Bali, O lord of"
2584,SECTION XXIV.,"Rākshasas, O thou gifted with great energy, do thou speedily enter (this"
2585,SECTION XXIV.,house) and engage in the encounter.’ Being thus addressed the Ten-necked
2586,SECTION XXIV.,"demon entered where Bali was. Beholding the lord of Lankā, the foremost"
2587,SECTION XXIV.,"of Dānavas, resembling the flaming fire, and hard to look at like the"
2588,SECTION XXIV.,"sun, laughed. And taking that Rākshasa by the hand and placing him on"
2589,SECTION XXIV.,"his lap he said. ’O Ten-necked lord of Rākshasas, O thou having long"
2590,SECTION XXIV.,"arms, what desire of thine may I satisfy? Do thou tell me what for thou"
2591,SECTION XXIV.,hast come hither.’ Being thus addressed by Bali Rāvana said—’I have
2592,SECTION XXIV.,"heard, O illustrious sir, that formerly thou wast bound by Vishnu."
2593,SECTION XXIV.,Forsooth I am capable of releasing thee from the bonds.’ Hearing that
2594,SECTION XXIV.,"Bali laughed and said—’Hear, I shall relate to thee what thou hast"
2595,SECTION XXIV.,"asked, O Rāvana. The red-hued man, who stands always at the door—by him"
2596,SECTION XXIV.,formerly all the leading Dānavas and other powerful lords were brought
2597,SECTION XXIV.,into subjection—by him I was also bound. He is invincible like unto
2598,SECTION XXIV.,"death; who is there on this earth that can deceive him? He, who stands"
2599,SECTION XXIV.,"at the door, is the destroyer of all beings, creator and preserver and"
2600,SECTION XXIV.,the lord of the three worlds. Thou dost not know him nor do I. He is
2601,SECTION XXIV.,"identical with past, future and present and is the lord. He is Kali and"
2602,SECTION XXIV.,he is Time—the destroyer of all beings. He is the destroyer and the
2603,SECTION XXIV.,creator of the three worlds—and he slays all beings mobile and immobile.
2604,SECTION XXIV.,And that lord of all gods again creates the universe without beginning
2605,SECTION XXIV.,"or end. O night-ranger, he governs and preserves all sacrifices, gifts"
2606,SECTION XXIV.,and oblations to fire. Forsooth he is the creator and the preserver of
2607,SECTION XXIV.,the universe—there is none so wonderful in the three worlds. O son of
2608,SECTION XXIV.,"Pulasta, He hath been guiding the former Dānavas, myself, yourself like"
2609,SECTION XXIV.,"so many beasts bound with ropes. Vitra, Danu, Suka, Sambhu, Nishumbha,"
2610,SECTION XXIV.,"Sumbha, Kālanemi, Prahlada and others, Kuta, Vairochana, Mridu, Jamala,"
2611,SECTION XXIV.,"Arjuna, Kansa, Kaitabha, and Madhu used to impart heat like the sun,"
2612,SECTION XXIV.,"appear resplendant like the rays, move about like air and pour showers"
2613,SECTION XXIV.,like Indra. All of them celebrated many a sacrifice and were engaged in
2614,SECTION XXIV.,austere penances. All of them were high-souled and considered the
2615,SECTION XXIV.,practice of Yoga as a great virtue. Having got by an immense accession
2616,SECTION XXIV.,"of wealth they enjoyed many pleasures, made many gifts, celebrated many"
2617,SECTION XXIV.,"sacrifices, studied (many lores) and governed their subjects. They were"
2618,SECTION XXIV.,all protectors of their own kith and kin and slayers of enemies; and in
2619,SECTION XXIV.,"battle, there was none equal to them in the three worlds. They were all"
2620,SECTION XXIV.,"heroic, of a high pedigree, versed in all sacred writings, proficient in"
2621,SECTION XXIV.,all branches of learning and indomitable in warfare. Having defeated
2622,SECTION XXIV.,"thousands of celestials in conflict, the high-souled ones conquered the"
2623,SECTION XXIV.,regions. They were always engaged in those works which were not liked by
2624,SECTION XXIV.,the celestials and used to maintain their own men. They were all
2625,SECTION XXIV.,inflated with pride and haughtiness and effulgent like the newly-risen
2626,SECTION XXIV.,"sun. The glorious Hari, the lord Vishnu, knoweth only how to bring about"
2627,SECTION XXIV.,their destruction who perpetually assail the celestials. He creates all
2628,SECTION XXIV.,"these and He, bringing about their destruction, existeth in Himself at"
2629,SECTION XXIV.,the time of dissolution. These highly powerful and high-souled Danava
2630,SECTION XXIV.,"chiefs, assuming shapes at will, have been destroyed by the glorious"
2631,SECTION XXIV.,"God. Besides, all these heroes, who have been heard of as being"
2632,SECTION XXIV.,"irrepressible and invincible in warfare, have been discomfitted by the"
2633,SECTION XXIV.,wondrous power of Kritānta.’ Having said this the lord of Dānavas again
2634,SECTION XXIV.,"spoke unto the lord of Rākshsas—’O hero, O thou gifted with great"
2635,SECTION XXIV.,"strength, take that flaming discus which thou beholdest and come to my"
2636,SECTION XXIV.,side. I shall then relate to thee the means of eternal liberation. Do
2637,SECTION XXIV.,"what I have told thee, O thou having long arms. Delay not Rāvana.’"
2638,SECTION XXIV.,"Hearing this the highly powerful Raksha proceeded, laughing, O"
2639,SECTION XXIV.,"descendant of Raghu, where that celestial _kundala_ was. Rāvana, proud"
2640,SECTION XXIV.,"of his prowess, easily took it up but could not move it by any means."
2641,SECTION XXIV.,And being ashamed that highly powerful one again attempted. As soon as
2642,SECTION XXIV.,"it was uplifted the Rākshasa dropped down on ground, bathed in a pool of"
2643,SECTION XXIV.,"blood, like unto an uprooted Sāla tree. In the meantime there arose a"
2644,SECTION XXIV.,"sound from Pushpaka, and the councillors of that lord of Rākshasas cried"
2645,SECTION XXIV.,aloud. Regaining his sense that Raksha rose up in a moment and lowered
2646,SECTION XXIV.,"his head in shame. Bali said to him—’Do thou come, O foremost of"
2647,SECTION XXIV.,"Rākshasas and hear my words. O hero, the _kundala_, crested with jewels,"
2648,SECTION XXIV.,"which thou didst assay to take up, is an ornament for the ear of one of"
2649,SECTION XXIV.,"my forefathers. This fell here on the ground, O thou gifted with great"
2650,SECTION XXIV.,strength; another _kundala_ was thrown on the summit of the mountain.
2651,SECTION XXIV.,Besides these _kundalas_ his crown was also cast off on the ground
2652,SECTION XXIV.,before the altar during the encounter. Formerly none bore enmity towards
2653,SECTION XXIV.,"my ancestor Hiranya Kasipu—Time death, or illness. He had no death"
2654,SECTION XXIV.,"during the day, night, evening or morning. O foremost of Rākshasas, he"
2655,SECTION XXIV.,did not experience death from any weapon whatsoever. He created a
2656,SECTION XXIV.,dreadful enmity with Prahlada. This conflict having taken place with the
2657,SECTION XXIV.,high-souled and heroic Prahlada there rose up a dreadful figure of
2658,SECTION XXIV.,"man-lion—a terror unto all, O foremost of Rākshasas. And that terrible"
2659,SECTION XXIV.,"figure casting his looks about, all the worlds were over-whelmed."
2660,SECTION XXIV.,
2661,SECTION XXIV.,"""’Thereupon taking him up with his arms he destroyed him with his nails."
2662,SECTION XXIV.,"The person, who is standing at the door, is this supreme Yasudeva, void"
2663,SECTION XXIV.,of passion. I shall now relate to thee the words of that supreme God; do
2664,SECTION XXIV.,"thou hear, if thy heart is filled with spiritual thoughts. The person,"
2665,SECTION XXIV.,"who is standing at the door, hath brought into subjection, in thousands"
2666,SECTION XXIV.,"of years, a thousand of Indras, an Ayuta of gods and hundreds of great"
2667,SECTION XXIV.,"Rishis.’ Hearing these words Rāvana said—’(I have seen) Kritānta, the"
2668,SECTION XXIV.,"lord of spirits with Death himself, with hairs standing erect. Serpents"
2669,SECTION XXIV.,"and scorpions are his hairs—his tongue is hard as the lightning, his"
2670,SECTION XXIV.,teeth are dreadful—his eyes are red and he is gifted with great velocity
2671,SECTION XXIV.,and a terror unto all beings. He is incapable of being looked at like
2672,SECTION XXIV.,"unto the sun, unconquerable in battle and is the chastiser of the"
2673,SECTION XXIV.,sinners. He even was defeated by me in conflict. There I did not feel
2674,SECTION XXIV.,"the least pain or fear, O lord of Dānavas. I do not know (this"
2675,SECTION XXIV.,person)—it behoveth thee to give me an account.’
2676,SECTION XXIV.,
2677,SECTION XXIV.,"""Hearing the words of Rāvana Bali said—’He is the lord Hari—Nārāyana—the"

2679,SECTION XXIV.,"the highly effulgent Man-lion.⁷⁰ He is Kratudhāma,⁷¹ Sudhāma,⁷² and hath"

2683,SECTION XXIV.,"by flames, a great devotee and fond of devotees; this lord preserveth"
2684,SECTION XXIV.,"the universe and hath created it. And he, gifted with great strength,"
2685,SECTION XXIV.,"brought about destruction in the form of Time; and this Hari, with a"
2686,SECTION XXIV.,"discus in his hand, is sacrifice and is being worshipped in sacrifices."
2687,SECTION XXIV.,"He is at one with all gods—all beings, all worlds and all knowledge. He"

2830,SECTION XXVI.,"again resembling that of Yama, he struck, vehemently, Rāvana’s car"
2831,SECTION XXVI.,"therewith. That club, resembling the lightning, vehemently descended"
2832,SECTION XXVI.,"(upon Rāvana’s car) and Rāvana, like Sakra’s banner, was speedily upset"

2835,SECTION XXVI.,"Thereupon the entire Rākshasa host, emitting loud cries, stood"

2837,SECTION XXVI.,"regaining his sense, Rāvana, a terror unto all people, the lord of"
2838,SECTION XXVI.,"Lankā, greatly assailed the person of Māndhāta. And beholding that king"
2839,SECTION XXVI.,"in a swoon, the highly powerful night-rangers were greatly delighted and"
2840,SECTION XXVI.,emitted leonine roars. Regaining his sense in a moment the king of
2841,SECTION XXVI.,Ayodhyā beheld his enemy worshipped by the courtiers and night-rangers.
2842,SECTION XXVI.,He was instantly worked up with ire; and assuming a person resplendant
2843,SECTION XXVI.,like that of the sun and the moon he began to slay the Rākshasa host
2844,SECTION XXVI.,with a dreadful downpour of shafts. With his arrows and the noise
2845,SECTION XXVI.,thereof the entire Rākshasa army were overwhelmed like the agitated
2846,SECTION XXVI.,deep. Thereupon there arose a dreadful conflict between men and demons.
2847,SECTION XXVI.,"And those two heroic, high-souled and foremost of men and Rākshasas"
2848,SECTION XXVI.,seated on warriors’ seats and holding bow and daggers entered (the

2850,SECTION XXVI.,"with shafts—Māndhāta Rāvana and he again the king. They, being assailed"
2851,SECTION XXVI.,"by one another, were both wounded. And setting the Raudra shaft upon his"
2852,SECTION XXVI.,bow Rāvana discharged it and Māndhāta baffled it by means of his fiery
2853,SECTION XXVI.,shafts. The Ten-necked demon took up the Gandharva weapon and the king
2854,SECTION XXVI.,Māndhāta the Brahmā-weapon striking terror unto all. Rāvana then took up
2855,SECTION XXVI.,"the celestial Pāsupata weapon, dreadful and increasing the fright of the"
2856,SECTION XXVI.,"three worlds, obtained by him from Rudra by virtue of his rigid"
2857,SECTION XXVI.,"penances. Seeing this all animals, mobile and immobile, were stricken"
2858,SECTION XXVI.,with terror. Thereupon trembled all the three worlds consisting of
2859,SECTION XXVI.,mobile and immobile beings—the celestials and all the serpents became
2860,SECTION XXVI.,inert. Being apprised (of this conflict) by virtue of meditation the two
2861,SECTION XXVI.,foremost of ascetics Pulastya and Gālava remonstrated with them in many

3073,SECTION XXVIII.,conferred upon him by the Self-born and he speedily issued out of that

3075,SECTION XXVIII.,"house, seat and bed were all white and valuable and he was sleeping"
3076,SECTION XXVIII.,enveloped by fire. And there sat gracefully with a fan in her lotus

3081,SECTION XXVIII.,"vicious Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas, on beholding that chaste damsel"
3082,SECTION XXVIII.,"with sweet smiles seated on a royal seat, being possessed by desire,"
3083,SECTION XXVIII.,"grew anxious to hold her by the hand, as one, under the influence of"
3084,SECTION XXVIII.,"death, catches a sleeping serpent. Beholding that lord of Rākshasas with"
3085,SECTION XXVIII.,loose cloth and understanding him as desirous of holding (her) the
3086,SECTION XXVIII.,"deity, having huge arms, asleep and enveloped with flames, laughed"
3087,SECTION XXVIII.,"aloud. And scorched suddenly by his energy, Rāvana, the dread of all"
3088,SECTION XXVIII.,"people, fell down on earth like unto an up-rooted tree. Beholding that"
3089,SECTION XXVIII.,"Rākshasa fallen he said the following words:—’Rise up, O foremost of"
3090,SECTION XXVIII.,"Rākshasas, thou shalt not meet with death today; thou shalt live and be"

3092,SECTION XXVIII.,"go away, O Rāvana, with confidence—thou shalt not experience death just"

3094,SECTION XXVIII.,"being thus addressed, that enemy, of the celestials, stood up and with"
3095,SECTION XXVIII.,"his down erect, said to that highly resplendant deity—’Who art thou"
3096,SECTION XXVIII.,"gifted with great energy and like unto the fire of dissolution? Tell me,"
3097,SECTION XXVIII.,"who art thou, O deity and whence thou hast come hither.’ Being thus"
3098,SECTION XXVIII.,"accosted by the vicious-souled Rāvana, the deity, smiling, replied in"
3099,SECTION XXVIII.,"words deep as the muttering of clouds, saying—’What shalt thou do with"
3100,SECTION XXVIII.,me O ten-necked demon? Thou art not to be slain by me now.’ Being thus
3101,SECTION XXVIII.,"addressed the Ten-necked demon, with folded palms said—’By the words of"
3102,SECTION XXVIII.,the Patriarch (Brahmā) I shall not tread the path of death; there is
3103,SECTION XXVIII.,"none born amongst men, or the celestials who can equal me, and"
3104,SECTION XXVIII.,"disregard; by virtue of his prowess, the great Patriarch’s boon. His"
3105,SECTION XXVIII.,words can never be falsified—every great exertion is weak before them; I
3106,SECTION XXVIII.,do not behold any such man in the three worlds who can render that boon
3107,SECTION XXVIII.,"useless. O foremost of the deities, I am immortal—I do not fear thee;"
3108,SECTION XXVIII.,"and even if I meet with death, I may have it from thee and no one else,"
3109,SECTION XXVIII.,O Lord. My death from thee is both glorious and praise-worthy.’

3145,SECTION XXIX.,"unmarried, that demon held them captive in his car, having slain all"
3146,SECTION XXIX.,their friends and relatives. In this wise he got on his chariot many a
3147,SECTION XXIX.,"female of the Nagas, Rakshas, Asuras, Yakshas, Dānavas and of men. And"
3148,SECTION XXIX.,"they, all afflicted, shed tears, hot as firey flames, caused by fear and"
3149,SECTION XXIX.,fire of grief. As the ocean is filled with the currents of the rivers so
3150,SECTION XXIX.,that car was flooded with their tears originating from fear and sorrow.
3151,SECTION XXIX.,"And wept there in the chariot, hundreds of the females of Nagas,"
3152,SECTION XXIX.,"Gandharvas, of great ascetics, Daityas and of Dānavas. They had long"
3153,SECTION XXIX.,"airs, graceful persons, countenances resembling the full-moon, rising"
3154,SECTION XXIX.,"breast, slender waist like that of a black-bee and were graceful with"
3155,SECTION XXIX.,back like the pole of a car. They were like the females of the
3156,SECTION XXIX.,"celestials and the burning gold and were all afflicted by grief, sorrow"
3157,SECTION XXIX.,and terror and were young. And the car was ablaze on all sides with the
3158,SECTION XXIX.,sighings of those damsels and Pushpaka looked like the chamber where
3159,SECTION XXIX.,"fire is kept perpetually. The countenance and eyes, of those beautiful"
3160,SECTION XXIX.,"damsels, brought under the subjection of the ten-necked demon, and"
3161,SECTION XXIX.,"afflicted with sorrow, looked poorly like a hind attacked by a lion."
3162,SECTION XXIX.,"Some thought—’Will he eat me up?’ and another, stricken with sorrow,"
3163,SECTION XXIX.,"thought—’Will he destroy me?’ Thus remembering their mothers, fathers,"
3164,SECTION XXIX.,"husbands and brothers, all those females, overwhelmed with grief and"
3165,SECTION XXIX.,"sorrow, bewailed, some exclaiming—’What shall befall my son in my"
3166,SECTION XXIX.,absence? Alas! into what ocean of grief my mother or brother is sunk?
3167,SECTION XXIX.,"Alas! what shall my husband do in my absence? Therefore, O death, I"
3168,SECTION XXIX.,"propitiate thee, do thou take me, who am subject to miseries. Alas! what"
3169,SECTION XXIX.,an iniquity did I perpetrate in my former birth in another body?
3170,SECTION XXIX.,"Therefore, we all, overwhelmed with grief, are sunk in the ocean of"
3171,SECTION XXIX.,sorrow—and I do not behold the end of my miseries. Oh! fie upon
3172,SECTION XXIX.,humanity; there is none more vile than a man for they are weak. As the
3173,SECTION XXIX.,"stars disappear with the rising of the sun in time, so our husbands have"
3174,SECTION XXIX.,been destroyed by the powerful Rāvana. Oh! highly powerful is this
3175,SECTION XXIX.,Raksha and he is mad after devising the means of destruction. Alas!
3176,SECTION XXIX.,"being engaged in such vile actions, he does not consider himself cursed;"
3177,SECTION XXIX.,he is as powerful as he is vicious. And though the ravishment of
3178,SECTION XXIX.,"another’s wife is a greats sin, still that vile Rākshasa is enjoying us"
3179,SECTION XXIX.,who belong to others. Therefore this vicious-minded one shall meet with
3180,SECTION XXIX.,"death, by his own actions.’ As soon as these words were uttered by those"
3181,SECTION XXIX.,"chaste damsels, bugles were sounded in heaven and flowery showers fell"
3182,SECTION XXIX.,"on earth. Being thus imprecated by those chaste females, devoted to"
3183,SECTION XXIX.,"their husbands, he became shorn of energy and effulgence and appeared"
3184,SECTION XXIX.,like one divested of mind. Hearing their lamentations thus and being
3185,SECTION XXIX.,honored by the night-rangers that foremost of Rākshasas entered his city
3186,SECTION XXIX.,"Lankā. In the interval, Rāvana’s sister, a dreadful and grim-visaged"
3187,SECTION XXIX.,"she-demon, suddenly fell down on the ground. And having raised up his"
3188,SECTION XXIX.,"sister and consoled her Rāvana said—’Tell me speedily, O good sister,"
3189,SECTION XXIX.,"what you wish to say.’ Thereat that she-demon, having blood-red eyes,"
3190,SECTION XXIX.,"closed with tears, said:—’O king, by thee, powerful as thou art, I have"
3191,SECTION XXIX.,"forcibly been made a widow. Fourteen thousand demons, under the name of"

3196,SECTION XXIX.,enjoy the word ’widow’!⁸² My husband⁸³ should have been saved by thee in
3197,SECTION XXIX.,the battle. But he was slain by thy ownself in the battle; art thou not
3198,SECTION XXIX.,"ashamed of this?’ Being thus addressed by his bewailing sister, the"
3199,SECTION XXIX.,"Ten-necked demon, consoling her in sweet words, said:—’Of no avail is"
3200,SECTION XXIX.,"thy lamentation, dear sister; thou needst not be afraid of any of thy"
3201,SECTION XXIX.,"relatives. I shall please thee studiously by gifts, honors and favours."
3202,SECTION XXIX.,"Being mad after war-fare and desirous of acquiring victory, I was"

3204,SECTION XXIX.,"the conflict between my own men and enemies,—and thus unwittingly I did"
3205,SECTION XXIX.,"hurt thy husband. And thus, sister, thy husband was slain by me in the"
3206,SECTION XXIX.,conflict; I shall now do whatever shall conduce to thy well-being. Do
3207,SECTION XXIX.,thou ever reside by the side of thy rich brother Khara and he shall be
3208,SECTION XXIX.,the lord of fourteen thousand Rākshasas. That highly powerful one shall
3209,SECTION XXIX.,give food and clothes to all those Rākshasas. He is thy cousin and that

3211,SECTION XXIX.,speedily go to protect the Dandaka forest and the highly powerful
3212,SECTION XXIX.,Dushana shall be the commander of his forces. And the heroic Khara shall
3213,SECTION XXIX.,always obey thy words and be the lord of Rākshasas assuming shapes at
3214,SECTION XXIX.,will.’ Having said this the Ten-necked demon issued orders to his
3215,SECTION XXIX.,army—fourteen thousand highly powerful Rākshasas. Being encircled by
3216,SECTION XXIX.,"those grim-visaged Rākshasas, Khara, undaunted, speedily came to the"

3297,SECTION XXX.,"remained in Lankā, being engaged in pious observances. And the rest of"
3298,SECTION XXX.,the leading Rākshasas proceeded towards the city of Madhu. And all the
3299,SECTION XXX.,"Rākshasas went covering the sky, some on asses, some on camels, some on"

3301,SECTION XXX.,"beholding Rāvana proceed, hundreds of Daityas, inimical to the"

3303,SECTION XXX.,entered there the ten-necked demon did not behold Madhu but espied his
3304,SECTION XXX.,"sister. Thereupon being afraid of the king of Rākshasas, Kumbheenashi,"
3305,SECTION XXX.,"with folded palms, touched his feet with her crown. Having raised her up"
3306,SECTION XXX.,"the Rākshasa-chief Rāvana said ’No fear, what can I do for you?’ Whereto"

3309,SECTION XXX.,there is no other fear like this for damsels of high pedigree. The

3313,SECTION XXX.,there:—’Do thou tell me speedily where is thy husband. I shall go with
3314,SECTION XXX.,him for conquests to the region of the celestials. Out of pity and love
3315,SECTION XXX.,for thee I refrain from slaying Madhu.’ Being thus accosted; that
3316,SECTION XXX.,"Rākshasi, being pleased, got her sleeping husband, the night-ranger, up"
3317,SECTION XXX.,"and said:—’Here is my brother, the highly power Daçagriva. Being"
3318,SECTION XXX.,desirous of conquering the region of the celestials he prays for thy

3377,SECTION XXXI.,sprinkled with excellent sandal paste—her hairs were decked with Mandāra
3378,SECTION XXXI.,flowers—her body was beautified with other flowers and her movements
3379,SECTION XXXI.,tended to increase desire. Her eyes were beautiful and her waist was

3381,SECTION XXXI.,forehead and other parts of the countenance were painted with the marks

3422,SECTION XXXI.,"said this, the Raksha ravished her. Being released from his grasp Rambhā"
3423,SECTION XXXI.,became divested of her ornaments and garland and became like the river
3424,SECTION XXXI.,agitated by the elephants. Her hairs were dishevelled and her hands were
3425,SECTION XXXI.,"trembling. Like unto a blossoming creeper shaken by the wind, she,"

3428,SECTION XXXI.,"Nalakuvara said—’O fair one, what is this? Why hast thou placed thyself"
3429,SECTION XXXI.,"at my feet?’ Sighing heavily and trembling she, with folded palms,"
3430,SECTION XXXI.,"related to him everything from the beginning to the end. ’O lord, on his"
3431,SECTION XXXI.,"way to heaven, Daçagriva hath arrived here and hath spent the night with"

3442,SECTION XXXI.,"this and rinsed his mouth duly, he imprecated a dreadful curse upon that"

3447,SECTION XXXI.,"like unto a burning flame, was uttered, the celestial bugles were"
3448,SECTION XXXI.,sounded and a shower of flowers fell from heavens. Being apprised of the
3449,SECTION XXXI.,plight of people (brought about by him) and of the death of that
3450,SECTION XXXI.,Rākshasa the patriarch Brahmā and other gods were greatly delighted.
3451,SECTION XXXI.,"Hearing of that curse capable of making the down erect, Daçagriva"

3467,SECTION XXXII.,"region of celestials an uproar from the Rākshasa army, like unto the"
3468,SECTION XXXII.,"sound of the agitated deep. Hearing of the arrival of Rāvana, Indra"
3469,SECTION XXXII.,"shook on his throne and said to the assembled gods, Adityas, Vasus,"
3470,SECTION XXXII.,"Rudras, Sadhyas and Maruts—’Prepare yourselves, for fighting with the"

3475,SECTION XXXII.,"withstand, the Rākshasa Rāvana? The highly powerful Rākshasa hath come"
3476,SECTION XXXII.,"here for battle. It is by virtue of the boon that he is powerful, not"
3477,SECTION XXXII.,"for anything else. It is proper to make the words uttered by Brahmā,"

3479,SECTION XXXII.,"Nānrin and Samvara, so do thou make some arrangements (for his"

3482,SECTION XXXII.,"Thou art the graceful, ever-existing Nārāyana, having a lotus navel. By"

3488,SECTION XXXII.,"Being thus addressed by Sakra the lord Nārāyana; said:—’Do not fear,"

3504,SECTION XXXII.,appeared before the Rākshasas. Meanwhile at the latter part of the night

3506,SECTION XXXII.,Having got up and cast their looks upon one another the highly powerful

3519,SECTION XXXII.,"weapons, he, highly angered, began to assail the celestial host like"
3520,SECTION XXXII.,unto the winds scattering clouds. Being thus distressed by the
3521,SECTION XXXII.,night-rangers the host of the gods fled away into diverse directions
3522,SECTION XXXII.,"like a herd of deer attacked by a lion. In the meantime, entered the"
3523,SECTION XXXII.,"battle-field, the heroic and brave Savitra, the eighth Vasu, encircled"
3524,SECTION XXXII.,by soldiers and striking terror into the hearts of the enemies. And the
3525,SECTION XXXII.,"two Adityas, the highly powerful Tushthā, and Pushā united and"
3526,SECTION XXXII.,"undaunted, entered the arena. Thereupon there arose with Rākshasas a"
3527,SECTION XXXII.,terrible encounter of the celestials unable to bear their fame in
3528,SECTION XXXII.,"battle. Then the Rākshasas, with thousands of terrible weapons, began to"

3530,SECTION XXXII.,"began to send the redoubtable, powerful and terrific Rākshasas, with the"

3532,SECTION XXXII.,"Rāma, a Rākshasa, Sumālin, by name, getting enraged and with diverse"
3533,SECTION XXXII.,"weapons, ran amock of the soldiery. As the winds scatter clouds, so, he,"
3534,SECTION XXXII.,"under the influence of rage, with various sharpened weapons, committed a"
3535,SECTION XXXII.,havoc amongst the celestial soldiers. Thereupon being assailed by a
3536,SECTION XXXII.,"downpour of huge shafts, maces, Prāsas and diverse dreadful weapons, the"
3537,SECTION XXXII.,celestials could not keep their ground upon the field of warfare. The
3538,SECTION XXXII.,celestials being thus distressed by Sumālin the eighth Vasu Sāvitra
3539,SECTION XXXII.,stood there enraged. And encircled by his own car-warriors that highly
3540,SECTION XXXII.,"powerful one, with his prowess, repulsed the striking night-rangers."
3541,SECTION XXXII.,"Thereupon there arose a terrible encounter, capable of making down"
3542,SECTION XXXII.,"erect, between Sumālin and the Vasu, who did not retire from the field"
3543,SECTION XXXII.,of battle. His chariot drawn by serpents was pulled down and destroyed
3544,SECTION XXXII.,by the high-souled Vasu by means of his huge shafts. Having taken up
3545,SECTION XXXII.,that car in the warfare with hundreds of arrows Vasu took up mace in his
3546,SECTION XXXII.,hands for his destruction. Having taken up that mace having a burning
3547,SECTION XXXII.,head and resembling the rod of Death Sāvitra struck Sumālin on his head
3548,SECTION XXXII.,therewith. Having failed on his head that mace shone like a fire-brand
3549,SECTION XXXII.,"as the thunderbolt, discharged by Indra, falls roaring on the summit of"
3550,SECTION XXXII.,a mountain. By the stroke of that mace his person was reduced to ashes
3551,SECTION XXXII.,"and therefore there was not seen in the battle field either his bone,"
3552,SECTION XXXII.,head or flesh. Having beheld him slain in the warfare the Rākshasas

3563,SECTION XXXIII.,"collecting all the Rākshasas stood there the highly powerful Meghanāda,"
3564,SECTION XXXIII.,"enraged, the son of Rāvana. Like unto flaming fire approaching towards"
3565,SECTION XXXIII.,forest that great car-warrior encountered the enemies in a precious car
3566,SECTION XXXIII.,"coursing at will. And as soon as he, armed with various weapons, entered"
3567,SECTION XXXIII.,"the field the celestials, at his very sight, fled away to all"
3568,SECTION XXXIII.,"directions. None could stand before him, well-versed in war-fare."
3569,SECTION XXXIII.,"Thereupon beholding the deities terrified and pierced with shafts,"
3570,SECTION XXXIII.,"Indra, the king of gods, said—’Be not afraid, O ye celestials; do not"
3571,SECTION XXXIII.,"fly away; come back to the battle; this my son, who has never been"

3573,SECTION XXXIII.,"Jayanta, proceeded towards the field of action in a wondrous car. And"
3574,SECTION XXXIII.,having encircled Sachi’s son and encountered Rāvana’s son the deities
3575,SECTION XXXIII.,began to assail him. And the encounter between Mahendra’s son Jayanta
3576,SECTION XXXIII.,"and Rāvana’s son Meghanāda, and that between the deities and Rakshas was"
3577,SECTION XXXIII.,like one between gods and demons. Thereupon Rāvana’s son began to
3578,SECTION XXXIII.,"assail, with shafts feathered in gold, his (Jayanta’s) charioteer"
3579,SECTION XXXIII.,"Gomukha, Mātali’s son. Sachis’ son too, enraged, assailed on all sides,"
3580,SECTION XXXIII.,"Rāvana’s son and his charioteer. And the powerful Rāvani, stricken with"
3581,SECTION XXXIII.,"ire and with eyes expanded, covered Sakra’s son with arrows. Thereupon"
3582,SECTION XXXIII.,Rāvana’s son struck the celestial host with thousands of huge mountain
3583,SECTION XXXIII.,"summits, Sataghnis, maces, Prasas, clubs, daggers, Parashus and various"
3584,SECTION XXXIII.,"other sharp pointed weapons, Rāvana’s son thus striking Indra’s army the"
3585,SECTION XXXIII.,quarters were enshrouded with darkness by his illusory power. Being
3586,SECTION XXXIII.,"overpowered with arrows on all sides the celestial army, leaving aside"
3587,SECTION XXXIII.,"Jayanta, became restless. The deities or the Rākshasa—they could not"
3588,SECTION XXXIII.,recognize one another—and being distressed they ran about on all sides.
3589,SECTION XXXIII.,Being enveloped with darkness and having their senses bewildered the
3590,SECTION XXXIII.,celestials killed their own kith and the Rākshasas their own men—and
3591,SECTION XXXIII.,others fled away. In the interim a heroic and powerful
3592,SECTION XXXIII.,"Daitya-chief—Pulomā by name, taking Sachi’s son disappeared. And taking"
3593,SECTION XXXIII.,his own grand-son he entered into the ocean—Pulomā was his grand-father

3595,SECTION XXXIII.,the deities greatly sorry and distressed fled away on all sides.
3596,SECTION XXXIII.,"Thereupon Rāvana’s son, enraged and encircled by his own powerful"
3597,SECTION XXXIII.,"followers, pursued the celestials emitting loud cries. Not beholding his"
3598,SECTION XXXIII.,son and observing the flight of the deities the king of the celestials
3599,SECTION XXXIII.,"said to Mātali—’Bring my car.’ By Mātali was brought, the celestial,"
3600,SECTION XXXIII.,"highly dreadful, huge and quick-coursing chariot, that was ready. (And"
3601,SECTION XXXIII.,"he having) ascended the car, the huge clouds, with lightnings, being"
3602,SECTION XXXIII.,"driven by winds, began to emit forth loud mutterings before the chariot."
3603,SECTION XXXIII.,And the Gandharvas began to play on various instruments and the Apsarās
3604,SECTION XXXIII.,"began to dance. And taking up various weapons, Indra, the king of"
3605,SECTION XXXIII.,"divinities, set out for the field of action, in the company of Rudras,"
3606,SECTION XXXIII.,"Vasus, Adityas, the two Aswins and Maruts. He, having set out for"
3607,SECTION XXXIII.,"battle, the wind began to blow high, the sun was divested of its"
3608,SECTION XXXIII.,brilliance and the huge fire-brands began to send out flames. In the
3609,SECTION XXXIII.,interval the heroic and the highly powerful Daçagriva ascended the
3610,SECTION XXXIII.,"celestial car, constructed by the Architect of the deities, encircled by"
3611,SECTION XXXIII.,the huge-bodied serpents capable of making down erect and by whose
3612,SECTION XXXIII.,breath the battle-field was ablaze. Surrounded by demons and
3613,SECTION XXXIII.,night-rangers and with the celestial car he encountered Mahendra in the

3615,SECTION XXXIII.,having come out from the field of action Rāvana’s son too stood silent.
3616,SECTION XXXIII.,Thereupon there arose an encounter between the Rākshasas and the deities
3617,SECTION XXXIII.,and there began a downpour of weapons in the conflict like clouds. And
3618,SECTION XXXIII.,the vicious-souled Kumbhakarna armed with various weapons came there—but
3619,SECTION XXXIII.,"he did not know,⁹⁴ O king, with whom the conflict was going on. And by"
3620,SECTION XXXIII.,"him enraged, the celestials were assailed with his teeth, feet, arms,"

3622,SECTION XXXIII.,"night-ranger engaged with the highly powerful Rudras and was wounded, in"
3623,SECTION XXXIII.,"the conflict, with incessant strokes of weapons. Thereupon the Rākshasa"
3624,SECTION XXXIII.,army began to fight with Maruts and they were overwhelmed in the
3625,SECTION XXXIII.,encounter with the stroke of various weapons. Some fell down on earth
3626,SECTION XXXIII.,slain and torn and others became insensible on the back of their
3627,SECTION XXXIII.,carriers in the battle. And they all stood there in a half-sensible
3628,SECTION XXXIII.,"mood, some holding the car, some elephants, some asses, some camels,"
3629,SECTION XXXIII.,"some serpents, some horses, some porpoises, some boars, some"
3630,SECTION XXXIII.,Pisaca-mouthed animals and some embracing the Pannagas. And other
3631,SECTION XXXIII.,"night-rangers, having their bodies sundered by the deities gave up their"
3632,SECTION XXXIII.,being. The Rākshasas being slain and lying down on earth the action
3633,SECTION XXXIII.,appeared wondrous like a painting. And there issued out in the
3634,SECTION XXXIII.,battle-field a river from weapons having blood for its silent waters and
3635,SECTION XXXIII.,infested with crows and vultures. Having beheld his own army slain by
3636,SECTION XXXIII.,"the deities the highly powerful Daçānana, enraged, entered the ocean of"
3637,SECTION XXXIII.,celestial army and slaying the deities in the conflict confronted Sakra.
3638,SECTION XXXIII.,Thereupon Sakra took up his huge bow by the twang where-of the ten
3639,SECTION XXXIII.,"quarters Were filled. Having unstrung his huge bow Indra struck Rāvana,"
3640,SECTION XXXIII.,"on his head, with arrows resembling the flame of fire and the rays of"
3641,SECTION XXXIII.,"the sun. And the Rākshasa-chief Daçānana, having long arms, also"
3642,SECTION XXXIII.,assailed Indra with hundreds of shafts discharged off his bow. They
3643,SECTION XXXIII.,having been thus engaged with each other with the downpour of dreadful
3644,SECTION XXXIII.,"shafts, all the quarters were filled with darkness and in consequence"
3645,SECTION XXXIII.,"thereof nothing was visible."""
3646,SECTION XXXIII.,
3647,SECTION XXXIII.,⁹⁴ For he was asleep till then so he was not acquainted with the

3660,SECTION XXXIV.,"in a moment, Rāvana, worked up with dreadful ire, sent out terrible"
3661,SECTION XXXIV.,"roars. And in anger, that irrepressible one said to the charioteer,"
3662,SECTION XXXIV.,stationed on the car—’Do thou take me to the other end of the enemies’
3663,SECTION XXXIV.,host. I shall soon with the stroke of various weapons despatch the
3664,SECTION XXXIV.,"deities to the abode of Death. I shall slay Indra, Kuvera, Varuna and"
3665,SECTION XXXIV.,Yama—what to speak of more—I shall soon destroy all the deities and
3666,SECTION XXXIV.,place myself above them. Be not sorry; do thou soon drive my chariot.
3667,SECTION XXXIV.,To-day I have told you twice to take me to the end of the enemy’s army.
3668,SECTION XXXIV.,We are now waiting near the Nandana grove—do thou take me to the hill
3669,SECTION XXXIV.,whence the sun rises.’ Hearing his words the charioteer drove the
3670,SECTION XXXIV.,"steeds, coursing at will through the enemies’ host. Thereupon being"
3671,SECTION XXXIV.,"apprised of his intention, Sakra, the king of the celestials, stationed"
3672,SECTION XXXIV.,"on car, said to the deities, in the field of battle—’O ye deities—hear"
3673,SECTION XXXIV.,"my words, what appear to me best. This Ten-necked demon must be"
3674,SECTION XXXIV.,"vanquished by us while alive. Ascending his car, gifted with the"
3675,SECTION XXXIV.,"velocity of the wind, the highly powerful one is proceeding amongst the"
3676,SECTION XXXIV.,army like unto the deep with waves rising during Parva. It is not
3677,SECTION XXXIV.,possible to slay him now—for he shall not meet with death in consequence
3678,SECTION XXXIV.,of the boon. So let us make him captive—and we should all exert to that
3679,SECTION XXXIV.,end. Bali being held captive I am enjoying the three worlds—and I think
3680,SECTION XXXIV.,proper to obstruct the course of this vicious-souled one.’ Having said
3681,SECTION XXXIV.,"this and left aside Rāvana, Sakra went to another side, O King, and"
3682,SECTION XXXIV.,"fought terrifying the Rākshasas in the conflict. Dacagriva, incapable of"
3683,SECTION XXXIV.,"being thwarted, entered by the northern route and the performer of"
3684,SECTION XXXIV.,hundred sacrifices by the southern. Thereupon having entered into the
3685,SECTION XXXIV.,army up to a hundred leagues—the lord of Rākshasas overpowered the
3686,SECTION XXXIV.,celestial host with a downpour of shafts. Thereupon beholding his own
3687,SECTION XXXIV.,"army slain, Sakra returned fearlessly and obstructed the Ten-necked"
3688,SECTION XXXIV.,demon. In the interim beholding Rāvana brought under his grasp by Sakra
3689,SECTION XXXIV.,the demons and Rākshasas cried aloud. ’Alas we are slain.’ Thereupon
3690,SECTION XXXIV.,"ascending his car Rāvana’s son, beside himself with rage, entered the"
3691,SECTION XXXIV.,"dreadful flank. And having resorted to the illusory powers, conferred"
3692,SECTION XXXIV.,upon him in yore by Paçupati he entered into the enemies’ camp and
3693,SECTION XXXIV.,belaboured them. Having left behind all other deities he pursued Indra
3694,SECTION XXXIV.,and the highly effulgent Mahendra too espied his enemy’s son. And albeit
3695,SECTION XXXIV.,"assailed by the highly powerful deities, Rāvana’s son, divested of mail,"
3696,SECTION XXXIV.,entertained no fear. Having overpowered the approaching charioteer with
3697,SECTION XXXIV.,many excellent arrows he covered Mahendra with a downpour of shafts.
3698,SECTION XXXIV.,Thereat having left his car and charioteer Indra mounted his elephant
3699,SECTION XXXIV.,Airavat and ran about in search of Rāvana’s son. Being invisible in the
3700,SECTION XXXIV.,welkin by virtue of his illusory powers and having brought Indra under
3701,SECTION XXXIV.,the influence thereof he struck him with hundreds of arrows. When
3702,SECTION XXXIV.,"Rāvana’s son came to know that Indra was exhausted he, having bound him"
3703,SECTION XXXIV.,"up by virtue of illusion, proceeded towards his army. And having seen"
3704,SECTION XXXIV.,Mahendra carried away by force from the battle field the deities thought
3705,SECTION XXXIV.,"’What is this?’ That conqueror of Sakra and subduer of enemies,"
3706,SECTION XXXIV.,"conversant with illusory powers, was not visible, by whom, Indra,"
3707,SECTION XXXIV.,"although master of many illusions, was carried away by force. In the"
3708,SECTION XXXIV.,"meantime, the celestials, all enraged, covered Rāvana with a downpour of"
3709,SECTION XXXIV.,shafts and belaboured him. And being worn out in the encounter with the
3710,SECTION XXXIV.,Adityas and Vasus he was not capable of fighting any more. Beholding his
3711,SECTION XXXIV.,"father thus distressed and assailed in warfare with strokes, Rāvana’s"
3712,SECTION XXXIV.,"son, although invisible, said—’Do thou come O father, our work in the"
3713,SECTION XXXIV.,"battle field is finished; know, we have achieved victory; be thou"
3714,SECTION XXXIV.,consoled and divested of agonies. By virtue of my illusory powers I have
3715,SECTION XXXIV.,made Mahendra captive—the lord of the three worlds and of the celestial

3717,SECTION XXXIV.,enemy by virtue of thy prowess do thou enjoy the three worlds at thy
3718,SECTION XXXIV.,pleasure. What is the use of labouring again? And useless it is to fight
3719,SECTION XXXIV.,again.’ Hearing the words of Rāvana’s son the deities retired from the

3751,SECTION XXXV.,thou want from the celestials?’ Thereupon the highly powerful
3752,SECTION XXXV.,"Indrajit—the subduer of enemies, said:—’If dost thou say so, O god, I"
3753,SECTION XXXV.,pray for immortality.’ Thereat the highly powerful patriarch said to
3754,SECTION XXXV.,Meghanada—’There is none perfectly immortal on earth amongst created
3755,SECTION XXXV.,"beings—birds, quadrupeds and other highly powerful beings.’ Hearing the"
3756,SECTION XXXV.,words uttered by the grand-father—the highly powerful Meghanāda said to
3757,SECTION XXXV.,"the eternal lord—’Hear, then, what I want in exchange for releasing"
3758,SECTION XXXV.,Sakra. May a chariot with horses rise up from fire when I shall offer
3759,SECTION XXXV.,"sacrifices unto it, being desirous of vanquishing my enemies in the"
3760,SECTION XXXV.,conflict. And may I be immortal as long as I shall remain on that car.
3761,SECTION XXXV.,This is the boon I have resolved upon praying for. May I meet with
3762,SECTION XXXV.,"destruction, O deity, whenever I shall engage in fight without finishing"
3763,SECTION XXXV.,"my offerings unto fire. All others, O god, attain to immortality by"
3764,SECTION XXXV.,virtue of devout penances but I shall acquire that by dint of my own
3765,SECTION XXXV.,prowess.’ Whereto the grand-father replied saying ’So be it.’ Thereupon
3766,SECTION XXXV.,Meghanāda released Indra and the celestials returned to their own abode.
3767,SECTION XXXV.,"In the interval, O Rāma, Indra became poorly, divested of his immortal"
3768,SECTION XXXV.,"brilliance, stricken with anxiety and pensive. Beholding him in that"
3769,SECTION XXXV.,plight the grand-father of the deities said:—’O performer of hundred
3770,SECTION XXXV.,"sacrifices, why didst thou formerly perpetrate that mighty iniquity? O"
3771,SECTION XXXV.,Chief of the immortals! O lord! Some creatures were created by me by
3772,SECTION XXXV.,"dint of my understanding—they were all of the same colour, same speech,"
3773,SECTION XXXV.,and same appearance. There was no difference visible in their appearance
3774,SECTION XXXV.,"or marks. Thereupon, with whole-minded-ness, I began to think of these"
3775,SECTION XXXV.,created beings. And I created a female distinct from them. Collecting
3776,SECTION XXXV.,"all those limbs that were most excellent amongst the created, I made a"
3777,SECTION XXXV.,female under the name of Ahalyā. _Hal_ means ugliness—one born from
3778,SECTION XXXV.,_Hal_ is called _Halya_. That female was known as _Ahalyā_ because she
3779,SECTION XXXV.,had nothing blameable in her. I gave her that name. Having created that
3780,SECTION XXXV.,"female I was thinking, O king of the celestials! O foremost of the"
3781,SECTION XXXV.,"deities! On whom I should confer her. Being proud of dignity, O Sakra, O"
3782,SECTION XXXV.,"lord, O Purandara thou didst regard her in thy mind as thy spouse. I"
3783,SECTION XXXV.,placed her under the care of the high-souled Gautama and he rendered her
3784,SECTION XXXV.,back after many long years. Thereupon considering the patience and
3785,SECTION XXXV.,accomplished asceticism of Gautama I married her with him. And that
3786,SECTION XXXV.,"virtuous-souled, great ascetic enjoyed her company; and for my thus"
3787,SECTION XXXV.,conferring her upon Gautama all the celestials were disappointed. But
3788,SECTION XXXV.,being enraged and possessed by lust thou didst repair to the hermitage
3789,SECTION XXXV.,of the ascetic and see her resplendant like the flaming fire. Maddened
3790,SECTION XXXV.,with lust and ire thou didst ravish her and thou wast seen in that
3791,SECTION XXXV.,"hermitage by the great ascetic. Thou wast then imprecated by him,"
3792,SECTION XXXV.,"enraged and gifted with great effulgence saying, ""O lord of the"
3793,SECTION XXXV.,"celestials, thou hast attained to a change of circumstances—for which, O"
3794,SECTION XXXV.,"Vasava, thou hast fearlessly ravished my spouse. Thou shalt, therefore,"
3795,SECTION XXXV.,"O Sakra, go under the arms of the enemies, in conflict. And this vile"
3796,SECTION XXXV.,"desire, O thou having a vicious intellect, which thou hast first"
3797,SECTION XXXV.,"created, shall undoubtedly spread in the world of mortals. Whoever shall"
3798,SECTION XXXV.,"commit this crime, shall be half responsible for it and the other half"
3799,SECTION XXXV.,shall descend upon thee; and forsooth thy position shall not be
3800,SECTION XXXV.,"permanent. And whoever shall be the lord of the celestials, shall not"
3801,SECTION XXXV.,"have his position secure. This is the curse I give, which I have"
3802,SECTION XXXV.,"communicated to thee."" And having remonstrated with his wife that one of"
3803,SECTION XXXV.,"devout penances said to her—""O vicious one, let thy beauty be spoiled in"
3804,SECTION XXXV.,the vicinity of the hermitage. Thou art gifted with beauty and youth but
3805,SECTION XXXV.,thy mind is fickle; so thou shalt not continue as the single beautiful
3806,SECTION XXXV.,damsel in the world. All created beings shall participate thy beauty;
3807,SECTION XXXV.,"thy matchless beauty has brought about this mischief."" Thenceforward all"
3808,SECTION XXXV.,created beings were gifted with beauty. Thereupon she propitiated the
3809,SECTION XXXV.,"ascetic Gautama saying, ""O twice-born one, I was unwittingly ravished by"
3810,SECTION XXXV.,"Indra, assuming thy form. I have not committed this willingly, O"
3811,SECTION XXXV.,"ascetic—so do thou be propitiated with me."" Ahalyā having said this,"
3812,SECTION XXXV.,"Gautama replied:—""In the race of Ikshwākus, there shall be born a highly"
3813,SECTION XXXV.,"effulgent and mighty car-warrior, known in the world as Rāma; for"
3814,SECTION XXXV.,"performing the rites of a Brahman, the mighty-armed Vishnu, assuming a"
3815,SECTION XXXV.,"human form, shall repair to the forest. Thou shalt be purified when thou"
3816,SECTION XXXV.,"shalt behold him, O fair damsel. He shall be able to purify thee from"
3817,SECTION XXXV.,the iniquity perpetrated. Having treated him as a guest when thou shalt
3818,SECTION XXXV.,"come to me again, thou shalt live with me, O thou having a fair"
3819,SECTION XXXV.,"countenance."" Having said this that ascetic returned to his hermitage."
3820,SECTION XXXV.,"And thenceforward the wife, of that ascetic chanting the themes of"
3821,SECTION XXXV.,"Brahman, engaged in austere penances. Thou hast met with all this in"
3822,SECTION XXXV.,"consequence of the imprecation of that ascetic. Therefore, O thou having"
3823,SECTION XXXV.,"long arms, do thou think of thy past iniquity. For that curse and"
3824,SECTION XXXV.,"nothing else, O Vasava, thou hast been brought under the grasp of"
3825,SECTION XXXV.,"enemies. Having controlled thy senses, do thou soon undertake a"
3826,SECTION XXXV.,sacrifice in honor of Vishnu. Thou shalt be purified by that sacrifice
3827,SECTION XXXV.,"and go to heaven; and thy son, O lord of celestials, hath not been"
3828,SECTION XXXV.,destroyed in the conflict. He hath been taken into the ocean by his
3829,SECTION XXXV.,grand father.’ Hearing this and having celebrated the sacrifice in honor
3830,SECTION XXXV.,of Vishnu he again went to the region of celestials and reigned there as
3831,SECTION XXXV.,their king. I have thus described to thee the strength of Indrajit—what
3832,SECTION XXXV.,"to speak of others he vanquished even Indra—the king of the celestials."""
3833,SECTION XXXV.,"Hearing the words of Agastya, Rāma, Lakshmana, Vānaras and Rākshasas all"
3834,SECTION XXXV.,"said ""Wonderful it is,"" and Bibhishana, who was by the side of Rāma,"
3835,SECTION XXXV.,"said:—""After a long time, the old recollections have come to my mind."""
3836,SECTION XXXV.,"Thereupon Rāma said to Agastya—""All, thou hast said, is true."" And"
3837,SECTION XXXV.,"Agastya said ""Rāma, Rāvana, the thorn of people, then grew in power, by"
3838,SECTION XXXV.,"whom, in the company of his son, Indra, the lord of the celestials, was"
3839,SECTION XXXV.,"defeated."""

3844,SECTION XXXVI.,
3845,SECTION XXXVI.,
3846,SECTION XXXVI.,"Thereupon having bowed unto Agastya the foremost of ascetics, the highly"
3847,SECTION XXXVI.,"effulgent Rāma again surprisingly said:—""O Brahman, O foremost of"
3848,SECTION XXXVI.,"twice-born ones, when that cruel Rāvana journeyed over the earth, was it"
3849,SECTION XXXVI.,"void of people? Was there no king, or prince on earth to administer"
3850,SECTION XXXVI.,punishment unto him? Were all the kings then shorn of their strength and
3851,SECTION XXXVI.,prowess? And many kings I (hear) were vanquished and driven out by him
3852,SECTION XXXVI.,"with various excellent weapons."" Hearing the words of Rāghava, the"
3853,SECTION XXXVI.,"ascetic Agastya, having six sorts of wealth, laughing said, like unto"
3854,SECTION XXXVI.,"Brahmā, speaking to Rudra—""O Rāma, O lord of earth, traversing the"
3855,SECTION XXXVI.,"earth, Rāvana arrived at the city of Mahismati, resembling the city of"
3856,SECTION XXXVI.,"the celestials, where lived perpetually the deity of fire. There reigned"
3857,SECTION XXXVI.,"a king named Arjuna, effulgent like fire which was kept perpetually in a"
3858,SECTION XXXVI.,"well covered with _Sara_. One day the highly powerful Arjuna, the king"
3859,SECTION XXXVI.,"of _Haihayas_, repaired to the river Nerbuda, with his wives to sport."
3860,SECTION XXXVI.,"At the very same day, Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas, arrived there and"
3861,SECTION XXXVI.,asked his councillors saying. ’Where is the king Arjuna? Do ye speedily
3862,SECTION XXXVI.,"tell me; I am Rāvana, I have come to fight with your king. Do ye, at"
3863,SECTION XXXVI.,"first, communicate unto him the news of my arrival.’ Being thus"
3864,SECTION XXXVI.,"addressed by Rāvana, the learned ministers informed the lord of"
3865,SECTION XXXVI.,"Rākshasas, of the absence of the king. Hearing of the absence of the"
3866,SECTION XXXVI.,king from the citizens Visrasraba’s son came out of the city and reached
3867,SECTION XXXVI.,the Vindhya mountain resembling the Himalayas. He espied the mountain
3868,SECTION XXXVI.,extending over the welkin like unto clouds and rising up as if riving
3869,SECTION XXXVI.,the earth and obstructing the sky. The mountain had a thousand summits
3870,SECTION XXXVI.,and the lions were residing in the caves and hundreds of fountains were
3871,SECTION XXXVI.,falling from it; the mountain was as if laughing aloud and the
3872,SECTION XXXVI.,"celestials, Gandharvas, Apsarās and Kinsaras were sporting there with"
3873,SECTION XXXVI.,their females; and it appeared (in consequence thereof) like the region
3874,SECTION XXXVI.,"of celestials; and rivers, with waters transparent like crystal, were"
3875,SECTION XXXVI.,flowing. And it therefore appeared like a thousand serpents having
3876,SECTION XXXVI.,"trembling tongues. And casting his looks upon Vindhya mountain,"
3877,SECTION XXXVI.,"resembling the Himalayas and having huge caves, Rāvana, the king of"
3878,SECTION XXXVI.,"Rākshasas, reached the river Nerbuda, of holy waters and going rapidly"
3879,SECTION XXXVI.,"to the western ocean. Her waters were being agitated by buffaloes, deer,"
3880,SECTION XXXVI.,"tigers, lions, bears and elephants distressed by heat. Having covered"
3881,SECTION XXXVI.,"her, Chakrabakas, Kārandavas, swans, water-cocks and Sārasas, maddened,"
3882,SECTION XXXVI.,were emitting notes. The charming Nerbuda appeared like a beautiful
3883,SECTION XXXVI.,"damsel—having blossoming trees for her ornaments, Chakrabakas for her"
3884,SECTION XXXVI.,"breast, wide spread forest for her waist, the row of swans for Mekhala,"
3885,SECTION XXXVI.,"filaments of flowers for paste, watery foams for white silken cloth, the"
3886,SECTION XXXVI.,pleasure of descending into water for the pleasure of touch and
3887,SECTION XXXVI.,full-blown lotuses for white eyes. Having descended from his car and
3888,SECTION XXXVI.,"bathed in the waters of Nerbuda, the foremost of streams, resembling a"
3889,SECTION XXXVI.,"fair one, Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas, with this councilors, sat on"
3890,SECTION XXXVI.,her coast resided by many an ascetic. Delighted at her beauty and having
3891,SECTION XXXVI.,spoken highly of Nerbuda like unto Ganges he addressed his ministers
3892,SECTION XXXVI.,"Suka and Sārana with gestures, saying:—’Behold, having rendered the"
3893,SECTION XXXVI.,"earth pale, with his many rays, the sun, emitting parching heat, is in"
3894,SECTION XXXVI.,"the sky. But seeing me here seated, his rays have become cool like those"
3895,SECTION XXXVI.,"of the moon. At my fear, even the wind is blowing carefully, being cold"
3896,SECTION XXXVI.,and fragrant by the touch of the waters of the Nerbuda and removing our
3897,SECTION XXXVI.,"toil. This charming Nerbuda, abounding in crocodiles, fishes and birds,"
3898,SECTION XXXVI.,"though a natural stream, is standing still like a terrified damsel."
3899,SECTION XXXVI.,Being wounded in conflicts with many a king your persons have been
3900,SECTION XXXVI.,pasted with blood. Therefore like unto Sarvabhauma and other infuriated
3901,SECTION XXXVI.,"elephants going down into the water of the Ganges, do ye descend into"
3902,SECTION XXXVI.,the water of Nerbuda conferring auspiciousness and health. Bathing in
3903,SECTION XXXVI.,"this stream you shall be cleansed from sins. I shall, also on the coast"
3904,SECTION XXXVI.,"of this river, like the rays of the autumnal moon, reverentially worship"
3905,SECTION XXXVI.,"with flowers Mahādeva, holding Pināka in his hands.’ Hearing the words"
3906,SECTION XXXVI.,"of Rāvana, Prahasta, Suka, Sārana, Mahodara, Dhrumākshya and other"
3907,SECTION XXXVI.,councillors descended into the waters of Nerbuda. And she was agitated
3908,SECTION XXXVI.,"by those elephant-like leading Rākshasas like unto the Ganges by Vamana,"
3909,SECTION XXXVI.,"Anjana, Padma and other elephants, Thereupon having got up from the"
3910,SECTION XXXVI.,waters the highly powerful Rākshasas culled flowers for Rāvana’s
3911,SECTION XXXVI.,offerings. And in a moment the Rākshasas collected heaps of flowers on
3912,SECTION XXXVI.,"the picturesque banks of Nerbuda, resembling the white clouds. Flowers"
3913,SECTION XXXVI.,"being thus collected, Rāvana, the king of Rākshasas descended, into the"
3914,SECTION XXXVI.,Nerbuda for bathing like a huge elephant into the Ganges. And having
3915,SECTION XXXVI.,"bathed he got up, reciting excellent incantations. Thereupon having left"
3916,SECTION XXXVI.,off his wet cloth he put on a white one. And to find out place for
3917,SECTION XXXVI.,"worshipping, he, with folded hands, proceeded towards the banks. And the"
3918,SECTION XXXVI.,"Rākshasas too, like unto so many moving mountains, followed him. And"
3919,SECTION XXXVI.,wherever Rāvana went the golden _Siva Linga_ was brought. Thereupon
3920,SECTION XXXVI.,Rāvana placed that upon a heap of sands and began to worship it with
3921,SECTION XXXVI.,various nectar-smelling flowers and sandal. And having finished the
3922,SECTION XXXVI.,"worship of Siva, the foremost of deities, having the moon on his crown,"
3923,SECTION XXXVI.,"the conferrer of boons and the remover of miseries, the night-ranger"
3924,SECTION XXXVI.,"danced with uplifted hands and sang before it."""

3932,SECTION XXXVII.,"dreadful lord of Rākshasas collected the flowers, Arjuna, the King of"
3933,SECTION XXXVII.,"Mahismati, and the foremost of the victorous, was sporting with his"
3934,SECTION XXXVII.,wives in the water. And being encircled by them the king Arjuna appeared
3935,SECTION XXXVII.,like a leading elephant surrounded by a thousands of she elephants. In
3936,SECTION XXXVII.,order to measure the strength of his thousand arms the King of
3937,SECTION XXXVII.,_Haihayas_ obstructed the course of Nerbuda. Being obstructed by the
3938,SECTION XXXVII.,arms of Kārtavirjarjuna and having flooded the banks with her pure
3939,SECTION XXXVII.,"waters, Nerbuda flowed in an opposite direction. And the currents,"
3940,SECTION XXXVII.,"rising high as during the rainy season flowed with fishes, and"
3941,SECTION XXXVII.,"crocodiles. And that stream, as if driven against Rāvana by"
3942,SECTION XXXVII.,"Kārtavirjarjuna, carried away his collection of flowers. And having"
3943,SECTION XXXVII.,given up his worship which was half-finished Rāvana looked towards
3944,SECTION XXXVII.,"Nerbuda looking like an unwilling damsel and saw that she, with rising"
3945,SECTION XXXVII.,"currents, was flowing towards the east from the west and the waters"
3946,SECTION XXXVII.,beyond that were in a natural state like a quiet lady and the birds were
3947,SECTION XXXVII.,seated there without any anxiety. Thereupon being anxious to learn the
3948,SECTION XXXVII.,"cause of the rise of the river, the Ten-necked demon, with his right"
3949,SECTION XXXVII.,"finger, hinted Suka and Sārana. Being commanded by Rāvana, the two"
3950,SECTION XXXVII.,"brothers, the heroic Suka and Sārana proceeded towards the west by the"
3951,SECTION XXXVII.,"aerial way. And going half a league, the two night-rangers espied a man"
3952,SECTION XXXVII.,"sporting in the waters with some females. He was huge as a Sāla tree,"
3953,SECTION XXXVII.,"his hairs were floating on the water, he was inebriete and his eyes were"
3954,SECTION XXXVII.,reddened in consequence thereof. Like unto Sumeru holding the earth with
3955,SECTION XXXVII.,his thousand feet he obstructed the current of the river with his
3956,SECTION XXXVII.,thousand arms. And he was surrounded by a thousands of beautiful damsels
3957,SECTION XXXVII.,like an elephant by a thousands of she-elephants. Beholding that
3958,SECTION XXXVII.,"dreadful spectacle, the Rākshasas Suka and Sārana came back and"
3959,SECTION XXXVII.,"approaching Rāvana communicated (all) unto him. ’O lord of Rākshasas, an"
3960,SECTION XXXVII.,"unknown person, huge as a Sāla tree, is sporting with females"
3961,SECTION XXXVII.,obstructing the course of Nerbuda like unto a dam. And being withheld by
3962,SECTION XXXVII.,the thousand arms of that man the waters of Nerbuda were continually
3963,SECTION XXXVII.,"throwing up high waves.’ Hearing the words of Suka and Sārana, Rāvana"
3964,SECTION XXXVII.,"exclaimed ’This is Arjuna’ and proceeded to fight with him. Rāvana, the"
3965,SECTION XXXVII.,"lord of Rākshasas, having set out with a hostile intention against"
3966,SECTION XXXVII.,"Kārtavirjarjuna, the wind mixed with dust began to blow high with"
3967,SECTION XXXVII.,tumultuous sound. And the clouds began to mutter with a downpour of
3968,SECTION XXXVII.,"rain. And the lord of Rākshasas proceeded against Arjuna with Mahodara,"
3969,SECTION XXXVII.,"Mahaparswa, Dhrumākshya, Suka and Sairana. Within a short time the"
3970,SECTION XXXVII.,"dreadful Rākshasa, powerful as the elephant Arjuna, reached the banks of"
3971,SECTION XXXVII.,Nerbuda and espied there Arjuna encircled by females as an elephant
3972,SECTION XXXVII.,surrounded by she-elephants. At the very sight the eyes of the lord of
3973,SECTION XXXVII.,"Rākshasas, proud of his prowess, grew red and addressing the councillors"
3974,SECTION XXXVII.,of the king Arjuna he said ’Do ye communicate unto the king of
3975,SECTION XXXVII.,"_Haihayas_ that Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas, hath come to fight with"
3976,SECTION XXXVII.,"him.’ Hearing the words of Rāvana, the ministers of Arjuna stood up with"
3977,SECTION XXXVII.,"arms and said ’O good Rāvana, thou art well cognizant of the proper time"
3978,SECTION XXXVII.,for fighting. Now our king is drunk and is sporting with the females in

3981,SECTION XXXVII.,fighting. Or even if thou art anxious to enter speedily into conflict
3982,SECTION XXXVII.,"with Arjuna do thou slay us all at first, and then fight with the king.’"
3983,SECTION XXXVII.,Thereupon the hungry councillors of Rāvana slew some of the ministers of
3984,SECTION XXXVII.,the king and devoured some. There arose a dreadful uproar on the banks
3985,SECTION XXXVII.,"of Nerbuda, of the councillors of Rāvana and Arjuna. The warriors of"
3986,SECTION XXXVII.,"Arjuna assailed Rāvana and his ministers with hundreds of arrows,"
3987,SECTION XXXVII.,"Praças, darts, Tomaras, thunder-bolts and Karpanas. The warriors of"
3988,SECTION XXXVII.,Arjijna became dreadfully furious and emitted cries like the roaring of
3989,SECTION XXXVII.,"the deep infested with crocodiles, fishes and other marine monsters."
3990,SECTION XXXVII.,"Thereupon being enraged and displaying their own prowess Suka, Sārana"
3991,SECTION XXXVII.,and other ministers of Rāvana began to destroy Arjuna’s soldiers.
3992,SECTION XXXVII.,"Thereupon the emissaries, stricken with fear, went to the sporting king"
3993,SECTION XXXVII.,and communicated unto him the proceedings of Rāvana and his ministers.
3994,SECTION XXXVII.,Hearing those words and saying unto the females ’Do not fear’ he rose up
3995,SECTION XXXVII.,from the waters like an elephant. The eyes of that fire-like Arjuna were
3996,SECTION XXXVII.,reddened with ire and he shone dreadfully like the fire of dissolution.
3997,SECTION XXXVII.,"And taking up speedily his club, that one, always using golden clubs,"
3998,SECTION XXXVII.,pursued the Rākshasas like unto darkness following the sun. Holding up
3999,SECTION XXXVII.,"the huge club and hurling it with his arms, Arjuna, resorting to the"
4000,SECTION XXXVII.,"velocity of Garuda, went on. Thereupon stood there obstructing his"
4001,SECTION XXXVII.,"course the Rākshasa, worked up with anger and with a mace in his hand,"
4002,SECTION XXXVII.,like unto the Vindhya range standing in the way of the sun. And throwing
4003,SECTION XXXVII.,"down off his hand the iron mace, he, in anger, began to roar, like Yama."
4004,SECTION XXXVII.,And the top of the mace was ablaze like the tips of Asoka flowers. Not
4005,SECTION XXXVII.,"the least agitated on beholding that mace, the king Arjuna, by his club,"
4006,SECTION XXXVII.,"baffled its action. Thereupon uplifting the huge club, five hundred"
4007,SECTION XXXVII.,"hands long, the king of _Haihayas_ pursued Prahasta. And within a short"
4008,SECTION XXXVII.,time being struck down by that club gifted with great velocity Prahasta
4009,SECTION XXXVII.,fell down on earth like unto the summit of a mountain clapped down by
4010,SECTION XXXVII.,"the thunder-bolt of Indra. Beholding Prahasta fallen, Māricha, Suka,"
4011,SECTION XXXVII.,"Sārana, Mahodara and Dhrumākshya fled away from the battle-field. All"
4012,SECTION XXXVII.,the councillors having thus fled away and Prahasta being slain Rāvana
4013,SECTION XXXVII.,"speedily proceeded towards Arjuna, the foremost of kings. Thereupon"
4014,SECTION XXXVII.,there ensued a terrible encounter capable of making down erect between
4015,SECTION XXXVII.,"the thousand-armed Arjuna, the king of men, and the twenty-armed Rāvana,"
4016,SECTION XXXVII.,the king of Rākshasas. And taking up their clubs Arjuna and Rāvana began
4017,SECTION XXXVII.,"to fight with one another emitting cries like the mutterings of clouds,"
4018,SECTION XXXVII.,"like unto two huge bulls fighting for a cow, two agitated oceans, two"
4019,SECTION XXXVII.,"moving mountains, two effulgent Adityas, two burning flames, two proud"
4020,SECTION XXXVII.,"elephants, two proud lions and like the very Rudra and Kāla. As the"
4021,SECTION XXXVII.,mountains suffer many clappings of thunder-bolts so did they bear many
4022,SECTION XXXVII.,strokes. And all the quarters were resounded with the sound proceeding
4023,SECTION XXXVII.,from the stroke of their clubs like unto the sound of thunder-bolts.
4024,SECTION XXXVII.,"Being placed against the breast of Rāvana Arjuna’s club rendered, for a"
4025,SECTION XXXVII.,"moment, the welkin look like the burning gold as does the lightning. And"
4026,SECTION XXXVII.,striking again and again against Arjuna’s breast Rāvana’s club looked
4027,SECTION XXXVII.,like a huge fire-brand. Arjuna was not worn out nor was Rāvana. And the
4028,SECTION XXXVII.,conflict went on between them like the encounter between Bala and Vasava
4029,SECTION XXXVII.,in the days of yore. The King of men and the King of Rakshasas assailed
4030,SECTION XXXVII.,and wounded one another with their clubs like unto two bulls striking
4031,SECTION XXXVII.,one another with their horns and two elephants with their tusks.
4032,SECTION XXXVII.,"Thereupon worked up with rage, Arjuna, with his full might, smote Rāvana"
4033,SECTION XXXVII.,"on his breast, with his club. But Rāvana was well protected by the boon"
4034,SECTION XXXVII.,"of the celestial, so the club fell on earth sundered into two pieces"
4035,SECTION XXXVII.,"like one hurled by a weak wight. Still wounded by the mace of Arjuna,"
4036,SECTION XXXVII.,"Rāvana, shedding tears, ran away at a distance of four feet and sat"
4037,SECTION XXXVII.,there. Beholding Rāvana thus over-whelmed Arjuna sprang up and caught
4038,SECTION XXXVII.,him like Garuda holding a serpent and Vishnu binding Bali. Daçagriva
4039,SECTION XXXVII.,"being thus bound, the Siddhas, Charanas and the celestials exclaiming"
4040,SECTION XXXVII.,’Well done! Well done!!’ showered flowers upon Arjuna. And the king
4041,SECTION XXXVII.,emitted leonine roars again and again as a tiger joyous roars like a
4042,SECTION XXXVII.,"cloud, holding a deer under his grasp. Regaining his sense and beholding"
4043,SECTION XXXVII.,"Rāvana bound, Prahasta, in great anger, pursued the King of _Haihayas_."
4044,SECTION XXXVII.,And the Rakshasa force grew tempestuous like unto the rising of the
4045,SECTION XXXVII.,ocean during rains. Thereupon exclaiming repeatedly ’Leave him off!
4046,SECTION XXXVII.,Leave him off!! Wait! Wait!!’ The Rākshasa host hurled hundreds of
4047,SECTION XXXVII.,Musalas and darts in the battle-field. Not the least moved thereby the
4048,SECTION XXXVII.,"king Arjuna, the slayer of enemies, bore those weapons of the enemies of"
4049,SECTION XXXVII.,the celestials. Thereupon baffling the weapons of the Rākshasas by means

4079,SECTION XXXVIII.,"addressed the ascetic saying:—’Reverend Sir, thine visit, it is hard to"

4081,SECTION XXXVIII.,"Amaravati. To-day have I obtained all auspiciousness, O lord; to-day"

4137,SECTION XXXIX.,the southern ocean and thou shalt behold there Vāli like unto fire
4138,SECTION XXXIX.,"placed on earth.’ Hearing those words, Rāvana, the aggrandiser of the"
4139,SECTION XXXIX.,"triple world, remonstrated with Tārā and ascending his flowery car went"
4140,SECTION XXXIX.,"to the southern ocean and espied Vāli, having red countenance like the"
4141,SECTION XXXIX.,"rising sun, engaged in Sandhyā rites with whole-mindedness. Thereupon"
4142,SECTION XXXIX.,having descended from his Pushpaka car he with silent steps approached
4143,SECTION XXXIX.,"Vāli to bring him under his grasp. Casting his looks at pleasure, Vāli"
4144,SECTION XXXIX.,"saw him. Albeit apprised of his evil intention, he was not the least"
4145,SECTION XXXIX.,moved. And he did not care for him as a lion is not moved on beholding a
4146,SECTION XXXIX.,hare and Garuda on beholding a serpent. He then thought within
4147,SECTION XXXIX.,himself—’This vicious-souled Rāvana is approaching to catch me; holding
4148,SECTION XXXIX.,him under my arm pit I shall journey over the three great oceans.
4149,SECTION XXXIX.,"Everyone will behold the enemy Rāvana, under my arm pit as a serpent"
4150,SECTION XXXIX.,"possessed by Garuda, with his thighs, arms and clothes loosened.’ Having"
4151,SECTION XXXIX.,thought thus Vāli remained silent for sometime and reciting incantations
4152,SECTION XXXIX.,he waited there like a mountain. Thereupon the king of monkeys and the
4153,SECTION XXXIX.,"lord of Rakshasas, proud of strength, essayed to catch one another. Vāli"
4154,SECTION XXXIX.,was seated with his back (towards Rāvana); still from his footsteps he
4155,SECTION XXXIX.,perceived that he had come within the grasp of Rāvana’s army and he at
4156,SECTION XXXIX.,once caught hold of him like unto Garuda holding a serpent. Getting hold
4157,SECTION XXXIX.,"of Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas, desirous of catching him, (Vāli) and"
4158,SECTION XXXIX.,placing him under his arm-pit Vāli vehemently rose high up in the
4159,SECTION XXXIX.,"welkin. And he went away carrying him, scratching him again and again"
4160,SECTION XXXIX.,with his nails like unto winds scattering clouds. The Ten-necked demon
4161,SECTION XXXIX.,"being thus carried away, his councillors, to release him, pursued,"
4162,SECTION XXXIX.,"exclaiming, Vāli, in the welkin. They thus following him, Vāli, appeared"
4163,SECTION XXXIX.,in the sky like the sun in the midst of clouds. The Rākshasas could not
4164,SECTION XXXIX.,catch Vāli but were rather exhausted by the stroke of his arms and
4165,SECTION XXXIX.,thighs. What to speak of animals made of flesh and blood anxious for
4166,SECTION XXXIX.,their lives even the mountains make way when Vāli goes. Rising high up
4167,SECTION XXXIX.,"into the sky where even the birds cannot reach, Vāli, the lord of"
4168,SECTION XXXIX.,"monkeys and gifted with great velocity, by and by finished his Sandhyā"
4169,SECTION XXXIX.,"rites above the oceans. Being worshipped by the aerials their lord, with"
4170,SECTION XXXIX.,"Rāvana, first proceeded to the western ocean. And having finished there"
4171,SECTION XXXIX.,"Sandhyā prayers and recited incantations he, with Daçānana, went to the"
4172,SECTION XXXIX.,northern ocean. And having journeyed over many thousand leagues that
4173,SECTION XXXIX.,"huge monkey, with his enemy, finished his prayers there and then"
4174,SECTION XXXIX.,proceeded to the eastern ocean. And having recited his prayers there
4175,SECTION XXXIX.,"also, Vāli, the son of Indra, and the king of monkeys, carrying Rāvana,"
4176,SECTION XXXIX.,returned to the city of Kishkindhā. Having gone through his Sandhyā
4177,SECTION XXXIX.,"rites at the four oceans and carrying Rāvana, that monkey-chief was"
4178,SECTION XXXIX.,greatly exhausted and (therefore) descended into the gardens of
4179,SECTION XXXIX.,"Kishkindhā. Having got out Rāvana from his arm-pit, the foremost of"
4180,SECTION XXXIX.,"monkeys, laughing again and again said:—’Whence art thou coming?’"
4181,SECTION XXXIX.,"Thereupon being surprised greatly, Daçānana, the king of Rākshasas, with"
4182,SECTION XXXIX.,"eyes shaking with exhaustion, said to the king of monkeys:—’O king of"
4183,SECTION XXXIX.,"monkeys, resembling Mahendra, I am Rāvana, the king of Rākshasas; I came"
4184,SECTION XXXIX.,here to fight: but I have been defeated by thee. Alas! What strength is
4185,SECTION XXXIX.,thine! what prowess!! What gravity!!! Holding me like a beast thou hast
4186,SECTION XXXIX.,journeyed over the four oceans. O hero! What heroic wight is there who
4187,SECTION XXXIX.,"is not exhausted by carrying me so vehemently? O monkey, mind, wind and"
4188,SECTION XXXIX.,Garuda—these three are gifted with the velocity. Undoubtedly thou hast

4193,SECTION XXXIX.,"up fire the king of monkeys and the king of Rakshasas, embracing each"
4194,SECTION XXXIX.,"other, became friends. Thereupon holding each other by the arms they"
4195,SECTION XXXIX.,"entered the city of Kishkindhā like unto two lions, entering delightedly"
4196,SECTION XXXIX.,a cave. There like Sugriva Rāvana spent a month. Afterwards his
4197,SECTION XXXIX.,"councillors, desirous of destroying the triple world, took him away. O"
4198,SECTION XXXIX.,"lord Rāma, I have thus related to thee the previous history. Having thus"
4199,SECTION XXXIX.,"belaboured Rāvana Vāli at last made friends with before fire. O Rāma,"

4210,SECTION XL.,"accents, saying;—""Thou sayest that Rāvana and Vāli had unequalled"

4212,SECTION XL.,"liberality, strength, patience, intellect, knowledge of laws and means,"
4213,SECTION XL.,prowess and energy all exist together in Hanumān. When the monkey host
4214,SECTION XL.,"lost heart on beholding the ocean, Hanumān, consoling crossed over the"
4215,SECTION XL.,deep extending over a hundred leagues. Having desecrated the presiding
4216,SECTION XL.,"goddess of Lankā and on beholding Sitā there, he consoled her. What to"
4217,SECTION XL.,"speak of more, Hanumān, single-handed, slew Rāvana’s commander-in-chief,"
4218,SECTION XL.,"the minister’s son, his servants and his one son. Being released from"
4219,SECTION XL.,"the Brahma weapon Hanumān remonstrated with Rāvana, and reduced Lankā"
4220,SECTION XL.,into ashes like unto fire burning down earth. What I have seen myself
4221,SECTION XL.,"performed by Hanumān in the conflict is above the power of Kāla, Vāsava"
4222,SECTION XL.,and even the lord of riches. It is by the strength of the arms of that
4223,SECTION XL.,"Wind-god’s son I have obtained Lankā, Sitā, Lakshrnana, Victory, kingdom"
4224,SECTION XL.,"and my friends. What more, had not Hanumān, the friend of the king of"
4225,SECTION XL.,"monkeys—Sugriva, been in my company who could have brought Sitā’s"
4226,SECTION XL.,"intelligence? Why did not Hanumān, although wishing welfare unto"
4227,SECTION XL.,"Sugriva, reduce Vāli to ashes like so many creepers on the occasion of"
4228,SECTION XL.,"his quarrel with Sugriva? Methinks, Hanumān was not cognisant of his own"
4229,SECTION XL.,prowess then? And therefore he did stoop to witness the miseries of
4230,SECTION XL.,Sugriva—the king of monkeys who was dearer than his life. O thou
4231,SECTION XL.,"worshipped of the immortals, do thou truly describe unto me this action"
4232,SECTION XL.,"of Hanumān."" Hearing those well-meaning words of Rāghava, the ascetic"
4233,SECTION XL.,"Agastya said to him in the presence of Hanumān. ""O foremost of Raghus,"
4234,SECTION XL.,"what thou hast said regarding Hanumān is all true. As regards, strength,"
4235,SECTION XL.,velocity and intellect there is none who can equal Hanumān. O represser
4236,SECTION XL.,"of enemies, in the days of yore Hanumān was imprecated by the ascetics,"
4237,SECTION XL.,"whose curses never become fruitless, to the effect that he would never"
4238,SECTION XL.,be conscious of his whole strength. I am not capable of describing to
4239,SECTION XL.,thee the wondrous childish feat which Hanumān did perform in his
4240,SECTION XL.,"boyhood. But if thou art, O Rāghava, greatly anxious to hear it, I shall"
4241,SECTION XL.,relate—do thou hear with a quiescent mind. Hanumān’s father Keshari
4242,SECTION XL.,reigned in the mountain Sumeru which resembles gold by the influence of
4243,SECTION XL.,the sun. Keshari had a well-known wife by the name of Anjanā to whom he
4244,SECTION XL.,was greatly attached. The deity Wind begot on Anjanā an excellent son.
4245,SECTION XL.,"Repairing to a dense forest for collecting fruits, the excellent damsel"
4246,SECTION XL.,gave birth to Hanumān resembling the tip of a Sāla tree and went away.
4247,SECTION XL.,"Being distressed with hunger on account of the absence of the mother,"
4248,SECTION XL.,"Hanumān, just born, cried like Kartikeya, the commander-in-chief of the"
4249,SECTION XL.,"celestials, in the forest of _Saras_. At this time the sun resembling"
4250,SECTION XL.,"_Yavā_ flowers, having risen, Hanumān, to get a fruit, sprang up. Being"
4251,SECTION XL.,"desirous of holding the newly risen sun, Hanumān, resembling it, began"
4252,SECTION XL.,to leap in the middle of the welkin. The child Hanumān having thus
4253,SECTION XL.,"ascended the sky, celestials, Dānavas and Yakshas surprisingly exclaimed"
4254,SECTION XL.,"’The velocity, with which Marut’s son is going, is not possessed even by"
4255,SECTION XL.,"the Wind, Garuda and mind. If he has got such vehemence in his boyhood"
4256,SECTION XL.,what great strength he shall have in his youth.’ His own son thus
4257,SECTION XL.,"leaping, the wind, becoming cool by the touch of snow, began to follow"
4258,SECTION XL.,him proceeding in the sky lest the rays of the sun might scorch him.
4259,SECTION XL.,Rising high up in the sky on account of childish freaks and traversed
4260,SECTION XL.,many thousand leagues by the help of his father Hanumān neared the sun.
4261,SECTION XL.,Considering that he was a mere child and therefore not tarnished by any
4262,SECTION XL.,sin and that a great divine work would be accomplished by him in future
4263,SECTION XL.,the sun did not burn Hanumān. At the every day when Hanumān sprang up to
4264,SECTION XL.,"hold the sun, Rahu too essayed to possess him. Having reached the top of"
4265,SECTION XL.,"the sun’s car Hanumān touched Rahu; so he, the represser of the moon’s"
4266,SECTION XL.,"rays, accordingly went back on beholding the sun thus possessed. And"
4267,SECTION XL.,"repairing to the house of Indra, Sinhika’s son, in wrath and with"
4268,SECTION XL.,"frowns, said to him encircled by the celestials:—’O Vasava! O slayer of"
4269,SECTION XL.,Bala and Vitra—to remove my hunger thou didst give me both the sun and
4270,SECTION XL.,moon; why thou hast then given them to another? On account of the
4271,SECTION XL.,_Parva_ I came to devour the sun but another Rahu came and possessed
4272,SECTION XL.,"him.’ Hearing the words of Rahu, the King of the deities, wearing a"
4273,SECTION XL.,"golden garland, having his understanding bewildered, proceeded, on the"
4274,SECTION XL.,"back of his elephant-chief Airavat, huge like the summit of the Kailasa"
4275,SECTION XL.,"hill, with temporal juice always trickling, having four tusks, roaring,"
4276,SECTION XL.,"and adorned with golden bells, towards Hanumān and the sun with Rahu"
4277,SECTION XL.,"before him. Having left behind Indra, Rahu quickly went there but fled"
4278,SECTION XL.,away on beholding the huge-bodied Hanumān resembling a mountain summit.
4279,SECTION XL.,"Thereupon leaving aside the sun and being desirous of holding Rāhu, the"
4280,SECTION XL.,"son of Sinhikā considering him as a fruit, Hanumān again sprang up into"
4281,SECTION XL.,"the sky. Beholding Hanumān approach renouncing the sun, Rahu with his"
4282,SECTION XL.,"countenance only visible, desisted and went back. And considering Indra"
4283,SECTION XL.,as the saviour he again and again cried aloud ’Indra! Indra!!’
4284,SECTION XL.,"Understanding everything by the piteous accents of Rahu Indra said, ’No"
4285,SECTION XL.,"fear, I shall soon slay him.’ Thereupon beholding the huge-bodied"
4286,SECTION XL.,Airavat and considering him as a bigger fruit Māruti ran towards him.
4287,SECTION XL.,"Proceeding thus tempestuously when he rose above the head of Indra,"
4288,SECTION XL.,"Hanumān, looked in a moment dreadful like the fire of dissolution. But"
4289,SECTION XL.,"not greatly enraged the thousand-eyed lord of Sachi, with the"
4290,SECTION XL.,"thunder-bolt in his hand, struck the running Hanumān. Belaboured by the"
4291,SECTION XL.,thunder-bolt of Indra Hanumān fell down and broke his left jaw. He being
4292,SECTION XL.,"thus overwhelmed by the stroke of Indra’s thunder-bolt, the Wind-god"
4293,SECTION XL.,became displeased with the king of celestials and was determined upon
4294,SECTION XL.,bringing about mischief unto all created beings. The all-comprehending
4295,SECTION XL.,"wind, not spreading himself, entered into a cave with his son. Like unto"
4296,SECTION XL.,"Vāsava distressing all creatures by putting a stop to the showers, the"
4297,SECTION XL.,wind too put all animals into unbearable suffering by obstructing all
4298,SECTION XL.,execrations. On account of the anger of the Wind-god their breath was
4299,SECTION XL.,"completely obstructed, and the joints—as if pierced, became hard as"
4300,SECTION XL.,wood. _Sādhya_ _Vasatkār_ and all the religious observances of the
4301,SECTION XL.,triple world were put a stop to by the anger of the Wind-god. So the
4302,SECTION XL.,three worlds appeared as if stricken with sorrow. Thereupon the
4303,SECTION XL.,"afflicted celestials, Gandharvas, Asuras and men repaired to the"
4304,SECTION XL.,Patriarch Brahmā with a view to bring about the well-being of created
4305,SECTION XL.,beings. And with their bellies swollen for the obstruction of the wind
4306,SECTION XL.,"the celestials with folded hands said:—’O lord of created beings, thou"
4307,SECTION XL.,hast created four classes of beings and thou hast given us wind to
4308,SECTION XL.,"preserve our lives. But we do not know, why the wind, the lord of our"
4309,SECTION XL.,"beings, is distressing us, by obstructing our movements like unto"
4310,SECTION XL.,females confined in an inner apartment. Being thus distressed by the
4311,SECTION XL.,"wind we have come to seek thy shelter, O thou the remover of miseries—do"
4312,SECTION XL.,thou remove our afflictions consequent upon the obstruction of the
4313,SECTION XL.,"wind.’ Hearing those words of the created beings, their lord (the"
4314,SECTION XL.,"Patriarch Brahmā) again said ’Hear, why the wind, being enraged, has"
4315,SECTION XL.,"obstructed the course of all beings. Hearing the words of Rahu, Indra,"
4316,SECTION XL.,"the king of the celestials, hath belaboured the Wind-god’s son. It is"
4317,SECTION XL.,"for this that he hath been offended. Preserving the bodied, the wind,"
4318,SECTION XL.,"having no person, passes through them all. Without wind the body becomes"
4319,SECTION XL.,"like wood. Therefore the wind constitutes the life, the happiness and"
4320,SECTION XL.,the whole universe. Renouncing the wind the world cannot attain to
4321,SECTION XL.,happiness. Being cast off by the wind and having their breaths
4322,SECTION XL.,"obstructed, behold, the world, to-day appeareth like dried wood. Let us"
4323,SECTION XL.,"therefore go there where the wind, the giver of our afflictions,"
4324,SECTION XL.,waiteth. If we do not please the son of Aditi we shall all meet with
4325,SECTION XL.,"destruction.’ Thereupon the Patriarch Brahmā, the celestials,"
4326,SECTION XL.,"Gandharvas, serpents, Guhyakas and other created beings went where the"
4327,SECTION XL.,wind was waiting with his own son belaboured by the king of the
4328,SECTION XL.,"celestials. Thereupon beholding that boy, on the lap of the Wind-God,"
4329,SECTION XL.,"resembling gold and Baisvanar, the four-mouthed Brahmā, the celestials,"
4330,SECTION XL.,"Gandharvas, Rishis, Yakshas and Rākshasas were all moved with pity."""

4351,SECTION XLI.,"four-mouthed deity, sprung from lotus, always resideth there. And from"
4352,SECTION XLI.,his eyes while going through the _Yoga_ practices tears trickled down.
4353,SECTION XLI.,"No sooner the Patriarch Brahmā, with his hands, wiped them off into the"
4354,SECTION XLI.,"ground than a monkey originated from those tears. O foremost of men, as"
4355,SECTION XLI.,"soon as that monkey was produced, the high-souled Brahmā consoled him in"
4356,SECTION XLI.,"sweet accents and said—""Do thou proceed to that leading mountain where"
4357,SECTION XLI.,"the celestials perpetually reside. O foremost of monkeys, living upon"
4358,SECTION XLI.,many a fruit and root in that picturesque mountain thou shouldst always
4359,SECTION XLI.,live by me. And while thou shall live in this wise for some time thou
4360,SECTION XLI.,"shalt be crowned with auspiciousness."" Brahmā having said this, O"
4361,SECTION XLI.,"Rāghava, the foremost of monkeys saluted that god of gods, placing his"
4362,SECTION XLI.,"head at his feet and said to that Primaeval deity, the creator of beings"
4363,SECTION XLI.,"and the lord of the universe. ""O god, thou art placing me under thy"
4364,SECTION XLI.,"behests—verily I shall follow them."" Having said this to Patriarch that"
4365,SECTION XLI.,monkey immediately went to a forest abounding in fruits and flowers.
4366,SECTION XLI.,"There living on fruits and collecting honey and various flowers, he,"
4367,SECTION XLI.,"every day, used to come to Brahmā in the evening. O Rāma, in this wise"
4368,SECTION XLI.,he used to make an offering of excellent fruits and flowers at the feet
4369,SECTION XLI.,"of Brahmā, the god of gods. Journeying in this way over the mountain he"
4370,SECTION XLI.,"spent many long years. Some time having elapsed in this way, O Rāghava,"
4371,SECTION XLI.,"Riksharaja, the foremost of monkeys, being distressed with thirst,"
4372,SECTION XLI.,"repaired to the excellent mountain Meru. There is a pond of pure water,"
4373,SECTION XLI.,resonant with the notes of various birds. Having shaken his manes with a
4374,SECTION XLI.,"delighted heart, Riksharaja saw his reflection in the waters. Beholding"
4375,SECTION XLI.,"his own image there that monkey-chief, stricken with anger and anxiety"
4376,SECTION XLI.,"thought—""What arch-enemy of mine is living in the waters? I shall"
4377,SECTION XLI.,"destroy the excellent abode of the vicious-souled one."" Thinking thus"
4378,SECTION XLI.,"within himself, that monkey, out of fickleness, jumped down into the"
4379,SECTION XLI.,"lake. And he again sprang up therefrom. And at the time of rising, O"
4380,SECTION XLI.,"Rāma, that leading monkey found himself metamorphosed into a female"
4381,SECTION XLI.,"form, which was highly charming, graceful and beautiful. Her waist was"
4382,SECTION XLI.,"spacious, eye-brows beautiful and hairs were black and curling; her"
4383,SECTION XLI.,"countenance was beautiful and smiling, breast high and beauty matchless."
4384,SECTION XLI.,"And there appeared charming on the banks of the lake, lighting up all"
4385,SECTION XLI.,"quarters that female, agitating the mind of all, and beautiful in the"
4386,SECTION XLI.,"triple world like unto simple _Sastilatā_, Ramā, without lotus, pure"
4387,SECTION XLI.,"rays of the moon, Parvati more beautiful than even Lakshmi. At this time"
4388,SECTION XLI.,"was returning by that way, Indra, the leader of the celestials after"
4389,SECTION XLI.,having worshipped the feet of Brahmā. And the sun too journeying arrived
4390,SECTION XLI.,there. They both simultaneously espied that female form and were
4391,SECTION XLI.,"possessed by desire. What more, their whole body, as soon as they saw"
4392,SECTION XLI.,"her, was moved and the firmness of the mind shaken. Thereupon Indra"
4393,SECTION XLI.,begot on her a son named Vāli for he originated from her hairs and the
4394,SECTION XLI.,"sun begot on her another son, who was named Sugriva for he originated"
4395,SECTION XLI.,"from her neck. Thus the two highly powerful monkeys being born, Indra"
4396,SECTION XLI.,went back to his region having conferred upon Vāli an un-ending garland
4397,SECTION XLI.,"of gold. And having engaged Hanumān, the Wind-god’s son in the service"
4398,SECTION XLI.,"of Sugriva, the sun too went back to the sky. O king, the sun having"
4399,SECTION XLI.,"risen after, that night Riksharaja again obtained his own real monkey"
4400,SECTION XLI.,shape. Having thus regained his monkey form he made his two highly
4401,SECTION XLI.,"powerful sons,—leading monkeys, assuming shapes at will and having tawny"
4402,SECTION XLI.,"eyes, drink honey, like nectar. Thereupon taking them, he came to the"
4403,SECTION XLI.,"abode of Brahmā. Beholding his son Riksharaja with his sons, Brahmā, the"
4404,SECTION XLI.,"grand-father of the celestials, consoled him in diverse ways. Then he"
4405,SECTION XLI.,"ordered the celestial messenger saying—""At my behest, O emissary, do"
4406,SECTION XLI.,"thou proceed to the highly picturesque city of Kishkindhā. That golden,"
4407,SECTION XLI.,big and charming city is worthy of Riksharajā. There live many thousand
4408,SECTION XLI.,monkeys besides others assuming shapes at will. It abounds in various
4409,SECTION XLI.,"jewels, invincible, is inhabited by four _Varnas_, holy and sacred. At"
4410,SECTION XLI.,my command Visvvakarmā has constructed the celestial and picturesque
4411,SECTION XLI.,"city of Kishkindhā. Do thou place there Riksharāja, the foremost of"
4412,SECTION XLI.,"monkeys, with his sons; and having invited the leading monkeys and"
4413,SECTION XLI.,others and received them courteously do thou install him on the throne.
4414,SECTION XLI.,"On beholding this monkey-chief, gifted with intelligence they shall be"
4415,SECTION XLI.,"all subject to him."" Brahmā, having said this, the celestial emissary,"
4416,SECTION XLI.,"with Riksharāja before him, proceeded to the highly picturesque city of"
4417,SECTION XLI.,"Kishkindhā. And having entered there with the velocity of the wind, he,"
4418,SECTION XLI.,"at the command of the Patriarch, crowned the leading monkey Riksharāja"
4419,SECTION XLI.,as king. And being sprinkled according to the ceremonies of
4420,SECTION XLI.,"installation, and adorned with a crown and various other ornaments he,"
4421,SECTION XLI.,"with a delighted heart, engaged in governing the monkeys. All the"
4422,SECTION XLI.,"monkeys, residing on earth consisting of seven insular continents and"
4423,SECTION XLI.,"bounded by ocean, came under his subjection. Thus Riksharāja was both"
4424,SECTION XLI.,the father and mother of Vāli and Sugriva. May good betide thee. The
4425,SECTION XLI.,"learned who listen to and make others hear this story, conducing to the"
4426,SECTION XLI.,"enhancement of their delight, get all their desires and objects"
4427,SECTION XLI.,accomplished. I have duty described to thee at length all events and

4441,SECTION XLIII.,those two sons of the celestials would be two highly powerful leading
4442,SECTION XLIII.,"monkeys since their origin is divine."" Rāma having said this Agastya"
4443,SECTION XLIII.,"said:—""O thou having long arms, thus in the days of yore the birth of"
4444,SECTION XLIII.,"Vāli and Sugriva was brought about. O king, I shall now again relate to"
4445,SECTION XLIII.,thee another divine theme. O Rāma I shall now describe to thee why did
4446,SECTION XLIII.,"Rāvana steal Sitā. Do thou hear it attentively. O Rāma, in the golden"
4447,SECTION XLIII.,"age, having bowed unto the Patriarch’s son, the truthful Rishi"
4448,SECTION XLIII.,"Sanatkumar, highly effulgent, resplendent like unto the sun, shining in"
4449,SECTION XLIII.,"his native brilliance and seated at his own place, Rāvana, the lord of"
4450,SECTION XLIII.,"Rākshasas, said:—’Who is now amongst the celestials brave and powerful,"
4451,SECTION XLIII.,by whose help the celestials can vanquish their enemies and whom the
4452,SECTION XLIII.,twice-born ones daily worship and the devotees meditate upon. O thou
4453,SECTION XLIII.,"having piety for wealth, O thou gifted with six sorts of wealth, do thou"
4454,SECTION XLIII.,"describe this to me kindly.’ Being apprised of Rāvana’s intention, the"
4455,SECTION XLIII.,"saint Sanatkumar, who saw every thing through his devotion, said to him"
4456,SECTION XLIII.,"out of love—’Hear my son. The learned duly, in their sacrifices, worship"
4457,SECTION XLIII.,"that Hari, respected of people and drinking nectar, who is the lord of"
4458,SECTION XLIII.,"the universe, whoso origin we do not know, who is daily worshipped by"
4459,SECTION XLIII.,"the celestials and Asuras, who is highly powerful Nārāyana from whose"
4460,SECTION XLIII.,"navel has sprung Brahmā, the creator of the world, and who has created"
4461,SECTION XLIII.,the universe consisting of mobile and immobile beings. The Yogis
4462,SECTION XLIII.,meditate upon him and celebrate sacrifices in his honor according to the
4463,SECTION XLIII.,"Purānas, Vedas, _Pancharātra_ and other rituals. He always vanquisheth"
4464,SECTION XLIII.,"in encounter Daityas Danavas, Rakshasas and all other enemies of the"
4465,SECTION XLIII.,celestials and every one of them worships him.’ Hearing those words of
4466,SECTION XLIII.,"the great ascetic Sanatkumar, Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas, bowing,"
4467,SECTION XLIII.,"replied:—’Being slain by Hari to what station do the Daityas, Danavas"
4468,SECTION XLIII.,and Rākshasas attain? And why doth Hari destroy them?’ Whereto
4469,SECTION XLIII.,Sanatkumar replied:—’Whoever are slain by the celestials do eternally
4470,SECTION XLIII.,"reside in their region. And being banished therefrom, they again take"
4471,SECTION XLIII.,their birth on earth. Thus by the misery and happiness acquired in their
4472,SECTION XLIII.,"pristine existence, they go through births and deaths. O king, all the"
4473,SECTION XLIII.,"monarchs, slain by Janarddana, holding discus and the lord of the triple"
4474,SECTION XLIII.,"world, attained to his own region; even his anger becometh like a boon.’"
4475,SECTION XLIII.,Hearing those words given vent to by the great ascetic Sanatkumar the

4495,SECTION XLIV.,"rivers and in all cities. He is Om, truth, Sābitri and earth. He is"

4497,SECTION XLIV.,"night, morning and evening, Yama, the moon, Kāla, the wind, Brahmā,"

4500,SECTION XLIV.,"the lord of men, Vishnu, Purana and the only destroyer of the world."
4501,SECTION XLIV.,"What is the use of speaking more, O Dasānana, He comprehends the three"
4502,SECTION XLIV.,"worlds, the mobile and immobile. Wearing a yellow raiment like unto the"
4503,SECTION XLIV.,"filaments of lotus, Nārāyana, resembling dark-blue lotus in colour, is"

4505,SECTION XLIV.,"covering his person, Lakshmi, in the shape of warfare, lies stationed in"

4509,SECTION XLIV.,"sacrifices, asceticism, self-control, gifts, sacrifices, nor by anything"

4512,SECTION XLIV.,"virtue of discriminative knowledge, have got their sins burnt. If thou"
4513,SECTION XLIV.,"art willing to behold him, hear, if thou dost like, I shall describe"

4520,SECTION XLIV.,the sun. In this wise the lord Nārāyana shall appear in a human form. At
4521,SECTION XLIV.,"the behest of his sire, the pious and the high-minded Rāma shall sojourn"
4522,SECTION XLIV.,in the forest of Dandaka in the company of his brother. His spouse the

4603,SECTION XLVI.,Swetadwipa. Thinking for a long time and being curious to witness that
4604,SECTION XLVI.,"wondrous encounter, Nārada speedily went there. He was ever fond of"
4605,SECTION XLVI.,sport and warfare. Filling all the quarters with dreadful leonine roars
4606,SECTION XLVI.,Rāvana with all the Rākshasas moved towards the Swetadwipa. After Nārada
4607,SECTION XLVI.,"had reached there, the illustrious Daçānana went to that insular"
4608,SECTION XLVI.,continent beyond even the reach of the celestials. Being struck by the
4609,SECTION XLVI.,"radiant heat of that insular continent, the Puspaka car, of the mighty"
4610,SECTION XLVI.,"Rāvana, could not stand there like clouds scattered by the wind. Having"
4611,SECTION XLVI.,arrived at that dreadful insular continent the councillors of the lord

4620,SECTION XLVI.,"thou come here? Do thou definitely say.’ Hearing those words, O king,"
4621,SECTION XLVI.,"Rāvana, in anger said:—’I am the son of the ascetic Visrava, I am Rāvana"
4622,SECTION XLVI.,by name; I have come hither being desirous of fighting; but I do not
4623,SECTION XLVI.,behold anyone here.’ The vicious-souled Rāvana having said this all the

4631,SECTION XLVI.,"that damsel let him off. Thereupon, another, taking that Rākshasa-chief,"
4632,SECTION XLVI.,"rose up in the welkin. Rāvana, again waxing wroth tore her with his"
4633,SECTION XLVI.,"nails. And being left off by that damsel, the terrified night-ranger"
4634,SECTION XLVI.,"fell down into the waters of the deep. The females, inhabiting that"

4637,SECTION XLVI.,"surprise. O thou having long arms, being apprised of this, the"
4638,SECTION XLVI.,vicious-souled Rāvana stole away Sitā with a view to meet death at thy

4645,SECTION XLVI.,"thou not recognise thyself as Nārāyana? O great one, do not forget"
4646,SECTION XLVI.,thyself; do thou recollect thy real self. The Patriarch Brahmā said that
4647,SECTION XLVI.,"thou art subtler than the subtle. Thou art the the three qualities, the"
4648,SECTION XLVI.,"three Vedas and the regions—that of the celestials, of the mortals and"
4649,SECTION XLVI.,"the region under the earth. Thy work is manifest in time, past, present"
4650,SECTION XLVI.,and future; thou art the observer of three Vedas and the destroyer of
4651,SECTION XLVI.,"the enemies of the celestials. With thy three steps, thou didst, in the"
4652,SECTION XLVI.,"days of yore, traverse the three worlds. Thou wert born of Aditi, as the"
4653,SECTION XLVI.,youngest brother of Indra for binding Bali. Thou art the eternal Vishnu.
4654,SECTION XLVI.,To extend thy favours unto humanity thou hast been born as man. O
4655,SECTION XLVI.,"foremost of the celestials, the work of the deities hath been"
4656,SECTION XLVI.,"accomplished. The vicious Rāvana, with his sons and relatives, hath been"
4657,SECTION XLVI.,"slain. The Rishis, having piety for their wealth and all the deities"
4658,SECTION XLVI.,have been pleased. O foremost of gods—all this hath been brought about
4659,SECTION XLVI.,by thy favours; and the whole universe hath been pacified. Sitā is the
4660,SECTION XLVI.,"very personation of Lakshmi, sprung from earth. It is for thee that she"
4661,SECTION XLVI.,hath been born in the race of Janaka. Bringing her into Lankā Rāvana
4662,SECTION XLVI.,"protected her with care like his mother. Rāma, I have thus related to"
4663,SECTION XLVI.,"thee the entire story. Hearing this from the Rishi Sanatkumar, the"
4664,SECTION XLVI.,"long-lived Nārada described this unto me. Daçānana, to a letter I"
4665,SECTION XLVI.,followed the instructions of Sanatkumar. Who ever listens to this story
4666,SECTION XLVI.,"at the time of Sraddha, the rice, offered by him, becoming"
4667,SECTION XLVI.,"inexhaustible, reaches his manes."" Hearing this celestial theme, the"
4668,SECTION XLVI.,lotus-eyed Rāma along with his brothers was greatly surprised. And
4669,SECTION XLVI.,"having their eyes expanded with delight the monkeys, with Sugriva, the"
4670,SECTION XLVI.,"Rākshasas with Bibhishana, the kings with their councillors, and all"
4671,SECTION XLVI.,"other assembled pious Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, and Sudras,"
4672,SECTION XLVI.,delightedly espied Rāma. Thereupon the highly effulgent Agastya said to
4673,SECTION XLVI.,"Rāma:—""O Rāma, we have all seen thee and been honoured; now we shall"
4674,SECTION XLVI.,"depart."" Saying this, they, being honored, repaired to their respective"
4675,SECTION XLVI.,"habitations. The sun set, Rāma, the foremost of men, gave farewell to"
4676,SECTION XLVI.,monkeys and their king and duly went through the Sandhya rite. Gradually
4677,SECTION XLVI.,night set in and he entered the inner appartment.

4684,SECTION XLVII.,"Kakutstha, knowing himself, being thus duly installed, the first night,"
4685,SECTION XLVII.,"enhancing the delight of the citizens, was spent. At dawn, the"
4686,SECTION XLVII.,"prisoners, to wake up the king, arrived at the palace. And those"
4687,SECTION XLVII.,"songsters, well trained and having a musical voice like the Kinnaras,"
4688,SECTION XLVII.,"began to eulogize the heroic king, to the increase of his joy. ""Awake, O"
4689,SECTION XLVII.,"gentle hero, increasing Kausalyā’s joy, O foremost of men. Thyself being"
4690,SECTION XLVII.,asleep the whole universe will be laid up with sleep. In prowess thou
4691,SECTION XLVII.,"art like Vishnu, in beauty thou art like two Aswins, in intellect thou"
4692,SECTION XLVII.,art like Vrihaspati and in the capacity of governing thou art like the
4693,SECTION XLVII.,"Patriarch Brahmā. Thy patience equals that of earth, thy effulgence"
4694,SECTION XLVII.,"equals that of the sun, thy velocity equals the wind and thy gravity"
4695,SECTION XLVII.,"resembles the deep. Thou art stable like a stake, gentle like the moon."
4696,SECTION XLVII.,No king like thee had flourished before—no other shall follow. O
4697,SECTION XLVII.,"foremost of men, thou art irrepressible, ever pious and engaged in"
4698,SECTION XLVII.,bringing about welfare unto thy subjects. Fame and wealth shall never
4699,SECTION XLVII.,"renounce thee. O Kākutstha, in thee are perpetually stationed grace and"
4700,SECTION XLVII.,"wealth."" Thus did the panegyrists eulogise him in various sweet accents"
4701,SECTION XLVII.,and Rāghava got up. Like unto Hari rising up from the bed of serpents
4702,SECTION XLVII.,"Rāma, thus eulogized, rose up from his bed covered with a a white"
4703,SECTION XLVII.,"coverlet. Taking white vessels full of water, thousands of well-trained"
4704,SECTION XLVII.,survitors stood waiting before the high-souled (Rāma). Washing his
4705,SECTION XLVII.,"mouth, being purified and offering oblation unto fire, he entered the"
4706,SECTION XLVII.,holy room of the tutelary deity much honored by the Ikshwākus. And there
4707,SECTION XLVII.,"having worshipped duly the celestials, manes and the Brahmins, he,"
4708,SECTION XLVII.,"encircled by men, came to the outer apartment And there arrived the"
4709,SECTION XLVII.,leading priests headed by Vasishtha and ministers all resplendant like
4710,SECTION XLVII.,unto fire. And there sat around Rāma the Kashatrya kings hailing from
4711,SECTION XLVII.,various provinces as the celestials sit encircling their lord Indra. The
4712,SECTION XLVII.,"illustrious Bharata, Lakshmana and Satrughna began to worship him and he"
4713,SECTION XLVII.,"appeared like a sacrifice conducted by Vedic hymns. And the servants,"
4714,SECTION XLVII.,"with their eyes shut, sat around him. The twenty heroic monkeys headed"
4715,SECTION XLVII.,by the highly powerful Sugriva also began to worship him. As the
4716,SECTION XLVII.,"Guhyakas worship Kuvera so Bibhishana, accompanied by four Rākshasas,"
4717,SECTION XLVII.,"waited upon him. All those who were advanced in the study of Vedas, born"
4718,SECTION XLVII.,"in respectable families, and learned, bowed unto the king lowering their"
4719,SECTION XLVII.,beads. Like unto the celestial-king Indra worshipped by the saints the
4720,SECTION XLVII.,"king Rāma was being perpetually honored by the effulgent saints, kings,"
4721,SECTION XLVII.,"monkeys, and Rākshasas. He appeared more beautiful than Indra at that"
4722,SECTION XLVII.,time. And religious themes were recited in that assembly by persons
4723,SECTION XLVII.,conversant with the knowledge of Puranas.

4726,SECTION XLVII.,

4729,SECTION XLVIII.,
4730,SECTION XLVIII.,Thus did the long-armed Rāma spend his days looking into all
4731,SECTION XLVIII.,administrative works relating to the city and provinces. Some days
4732,SECTION XLVIII.,"having elapsed, he, with folded hands, said to Janaka, the king of"
4733,SECTION XLVIII.,"Mithilā, ""Thou art our only refuge—we have been reared by thee and by"
4734,SECTION XLVIII.,the help of thy dreadful prowess we have been able to destroy Rāvana. O
4735,SECTION XLVIII.,"king, the relation between the families of Ikshwāku and Mithilā, is"
4736,SECTION XLVIII.,"unequalled and delightful. Taking the jewel, do thou proceed to thy own"
4737,SECTION XLVIII.,"city and Bharata as a help shall follow thee."" Saying ""So be it,"" the"
4738,SECTION XLVIII.,"king Janaka bespoke Rāma ""O king, I have been delighted with seeing thee"
4739,SECTION XLVIII.,"and thy courteous manners. The jewels collected for me, I do confer upon"
4740,SECTION XLVIII.,"my two daughters."" The royal saint Janaka having gone away, Rāma, with"
4741,SECTION XLVIII.,"folded hands and humbly said to his maternal uncle Kaikeya—""O king, this"
4742,SECTION XLVIII.,"kingdom, myself, Bharat and Lakshmana are all at thy disposal. The old"
4743,SECTION XLVIII.,king might have been grieved for thy long absence. It therefore behoveth
4744,SECTION XLVIII.,"thee, O king, to go there to-day. With immense wealth and various jewels"
4745,SECTION XLVIII.,"let Lakshmana follow thee."" Agreeing with his request Yudhājit said, ""O"
4746,SECTION XLVIII.,"Rāghava, let jewels and wealth be be inexhaustible with thee."""
4747,SECTION XLVIII.,"Thereupon, Rāma, at first saluted and went round him and then Yudhājit,"
4748,SECTION XLVIII.,"the son of Kekaya, went away to his kingdom in the company of Lakshmana"
4749,SECTION XLVIII.,like unto Indra (leaving for home) in the company of Vishnu on the
4750,SECTION XLVIII.,destruction of the Asura Vitra. Having bade adieu unto his maternal
4751,SECTION XLVIII.,"uncle Rāma embraced his friend Pratardana, the undaunted king of Kashi"
4752,SECTION XLVIII.,"and said:—""Thou hast displayed thy brotherly feelings and delight by"
4753,SECTION XLVIII.,making arrangements for my installation in the company of Bharata. O
4754,SECTION XLVIII.,"king, do thou now leave for thy city Baranushi, highly picturesque,"
4755,SECTION XLVIII.,"well-guarded, girt by strong walls on all sides and having"
4756,SECTION XLVIII.,"well-decorated gate-ways."" Saying this, Rāma, the descendant of"
4757,SECTION XLVIII.,Kākutstha rose up from his seat and embraced him cordially. Having taken
4758,SECTION XLVIII.,"farewell from Rāma enhancing Kausalya’s delight, the king of Kashi, with"
4759,SECTION XLVIII.,"his followers, fearlessly and speedily proceeded to his own city. Having"
4760,SECTION XLVIII.,"bade adieu to the king of Kashi, Rāma, with a smiling countenance and"
4761,SECTION XLVIII.,"sweet accents, said to the three hundred assembled kings: ""Being well"
4762,SECTION XLVIII.,"protected by your own prowess, you have all displayed your great love"
4763,SECTION XLVIII.,"for me. By your piety, truthfulness, sagacity and strength, the"
4764,SECTION XLVIII.,"vicious-souled Rāvana hath been slain. Forsooth, I am merely the"
4765,SECTION XLVIII.,instrument in the destruction of Rāvana—he hath been slain by your
4766,SECTION XLVIII.,"strength. Hearing that Sitā, the daughter of Janaka, had been stolen"
4767,SECTION XLVIII.,away from the forest the high-minded Bharata did bring you all—but
4768,SECTION XLVIII.,fortunately you were not constrained to go through miseries. High-minded
4769,SECTION XLVIII.,"as you are, you were all prepared for this work. Long since you have"
4770,SECTION XLVIII.,come here. I think it better that you should proceed to your respective
4771,SECTION XLVIII.,"habitations."" Whereto the kings, greatly delighted, replied: ""O Rāma, it"
4772,SECTION XLVIII.,is by thy good fortune that thou hast come off victorious and been
4773,SECTION XLVIII.,installed on the throne; it is by thy good luck that thou hast got back
4774,SECTION XLVIII.,"Sitā and the enemy Daçānana hath been vanquished. That we behold thee, O"
4775,SECTION XLVIII.,"Rāma, victorious and freed from all enemies, is our great benefit and"
4776,SECTION XLVIII.,"delight. The encomiums, thou hast showered upon us, are natural with"
4777,SECTION XLVIII.,"thee. Thou art Rāma, who always pleases people. Thou art worthy of being"
4778,SECTION XLVIII.,praised but we do not know how to praise thee. With thy permission we
4779,SECTION XLVIII.,shall now leave for our respective provinces but thou shalt always
4780,SECTION XLVIII.,"reside in our hearts. O thou having long arms, O great king, mayst thou"
4781,SECTION XLVIII.,"have that love for us perpetually that we may find place in thy heart."""
4782,SECTION XLVIII.,"Whereto Rāma replied saying ""So be it."" Thereupon the kings, highly"
4783,SECTION XLVIII.,"delighted and desirous of going, bade farewell unto Rāma, with folded"
4784,SECTION XLVIII.,"palms and being honored by him, left for their respective kingdoms."

4793,SECTION XLIX.,many Akshauhini soldiers with many steeds waited at Ayodhyā at the
4794,SECTION XLIX.,"command of Bharata. Those kings, proud and powerful, spoke to one"
4795,SECTION XLIX.,"another—""We did not face Rāvana—the enemy of Rāma; Bharata did uselessly"
4796,SECTION XLIX.,"invite us after the destruction of Rāvana. Had they brought us earlier,"
4797,SECTION XLIX.,"we would, forsooth, have slain him. We would have, on the other side of"
4798,SECTION XLIX.,"the ocean, well protected by the prowess of Rāma and Lakshmana, and"
4799,SECTION XLIX.,"freed from all disturbances, fought at pleasure."" Being thus delighted,"
4800,SECTION XLIX.,"all those assembled princes proceeded to their respective kingdoms,"
4801,SECTION XLIX.,dwelling on these and various other topics. And having arrived at their
4802,SECTION XLIX.,"celebrated cities, unscathed, abounding in delighted people, wealth,"
4803,SECTION XLIX.,crops and jewels they sent various presents of jems to Rāma for his
4804,SECTION XLIX.,"satisfaction. Besides this they made over to him innumerable horses,"
4805,SECTION XLIX.,"conveyances, infuriated elephants, sandal, excellent ornamants, jewels,"
4806,SECTION XLIX.,"pearls, corals, beautiful female servants and various cars. And taking"
4807,SECTION XLIX.,"all those jewels, the highly powerful Bharata, Lakshmana and Satrughna"
4808,SECTION XLIX.,returned to their own city. Having arrived at the picturesque city
4809,SECTION XLIX.,"Ayodhyā those foremost of men, made presents of various jewels unto"
4810,SECTION XLIX.,Rāma. Having delightedly accepted those gifts Rāma in return made
4811,SECTION XLIX.,"presents of them unto the successful king Sugriva, Bibhishana and other"
4812,SECTION XLIX.,Rākshasas and monkeys by whose help he had achieved victory. And those
4813,SECTION XLIX.,highly powerful monkeys and night-rangers wore on their heads and arms
4814,SECTION XLIX.,those jewels conferred on them by Rāma. Having placed on his lap the
4815,SECTION XLIX.,"long-armed Angada and Hanumān, the mighty car-warrior—the lotus-eyed"
4816,SECTION XLIX.,"Rāma said to Sugriva ""Angada is thy good son and Hanumān is thy wise"
4817,SECTION XLIX.,"councillor. O Sugriva, these are always engaged in my well-being and in"
4818,SECTION XLIX.,"giving me good counsels. For thee, therefore, O king of monkeys, I"
4819,SECTION XLIX.,"should honor them in various ways."" Having said this, the illustrious"
4820,SECTION XLIX.,Rāma took off from his arms valuable ornaments and adorned Angada and
4821,SECTION XLIX.,Hanumān therewith. Thereupon having welcomed and casting loving looks
4822,SECTION XLIX.,"upon the highly powerful and leading monkeys such as Neela, Kesarin,"
4823,SECTION XLIX.,"Kumuda, Gandhamādana, Sushena, Panasa, Mainda, Dwivida, Jāmbavān,"
4824,SECTION XLIX.,"Gabāksha, Dhumra, Baleemukha, Prajaghna, Saunāda, Dareemukha, Dadbimuka,"
4825,SECTION XLIX.,"Indrajānu and others, he addressed them all in sweet accents,"
4826,SECTION XLIX.,"saying:—""You are all my friends like unto my limbs and brothers. O ye"
4827,SECTION XLIX.,"inhabitants of forests, you have saved me from the ocean of danger."
4828,SECTION XLIX.,Blessed is the king Sugriva and blessed are the friends like
4829,SECTION XLIX.,"yourselves."" Saying this Rāma, the foremost of men, conferred upon them"
4830,SECTION XLIX.,duly many precious clothes and ornaments and embraced them all. The
4831,SECTION XLIX.,"monkeys lived there all happily feasting on fragrant honey, well-cooked"
4832,SECTION XLIX.,meat and various fruits and roots. In this way they spent more than a
4833,SECTION XLIX.,month—but it appeared to them as a moment on account of their devotion
4834,SECTION XLIX.,"unto Rāma. He, too also spent his time happily with monkeys assuming"
4835,SECTION XLIX.,"shapes at will, the highly powerful Rākshasas and the mighty bears. In"
4836,SECTION XLIX.,this way the delighted monkeys and Rākshasas spent the second winter
4837,SECTION XLIX.,month. Enjoying delight they thus spent their days happily in the city
4838,SECTION XLIX.,of Ayodhyā working to the welfare of Rāma.

4846,SECTION XLX.,"Ayodhyā. Thereupon the highly effulgent Rāma, the descendant of Raghu"
4847,SECTION XLX.,"said to Sugriva:—""O gentle one, proceeding to the city of Kishkindhā,"
4848,SECTION XLX.,"hard to be got at by the celestials and Asuras, do thou reign there"
4849,SECTION XLX.,"undisturbed with thy councillors. O thou having long arms, always look"
4850,SECTION XLX.,"towards Angada, with loving eyes. Do thou, O Sugriva, protect lovingly"
4851,SECTION XLX.,"the highly powerful Hanumān, Nala, thy father-in-law Sushena, the mighty"
4852,SECTION XLX.,"Tāra, irrepressible Kumada, the powerful Neela, the heroic Satabali,"
4853,SECTION XLX.,"Mainda, Dwivida, Gaya, Gavaksha, Gavaya, Sarava, the irrepressible and"
4854,SECTION XLX.,"powerful king of bears Jamvaban, Gandhamādana, valiant Rishava,"
4855,SECTION XLX.,"Supatala, Keshan, Sarabha and Sumbha—these and other heroic monkeys who"
4856,SECTION XLX.,dedicated their lives to my service. Do thou never act to their
4857,SECTION XLX.,"displeasure."" Having said this and embraced Sugriva again and again Rāma"
4858,SECTION XLX.,"addressed Bibhishana with sweet accents. ""I know thou art cognizant of"
4859,SECTION XLX.,"piety; the citizens, thy councillors and thy brother Kuvera also love"
4860,SECTION XLX.,"thee; do thou therefore go and govern Lankā piously, O king; never"
4861,SECTION XLX.,cherish any vile intention; the honest kings always enjoy the earth. And
4862,SECTION XLX.,"my only request to thee, O king, is that thou mayst with love remember"
4863,SECTION XLX.,"me and Sugriva. Do thou now proceed, divested of sorrow."" Hearing the"
4864,SECTION XLX.,"words of Rāma, the bears, monkeys and Rākshasas repeatedly exclaimed"
4865,SECTION XLX.,"glory unto Rāma and said ""O Rāma, having long arms, thy understanding"
4866,SECTION XLX.,"resembleth that of the Self-Sprung, thy prowess is equally wonderful and"
4867,SECTION XLX.,"thy beauty is also _par excellence_."" The monkeys and Rākshasas having"
4868,SECTION XLX.,"said this, Hanumān bowing, said unto Rāma ""May my loving reverence be"
4869,SECTION XLX.,"always in thee, O king; may my devotion unto thee remain unshaken, O"
4870,SECTION XLX.,hero; and may my mind be not attached unto any other thing. May my life
4871,SECTION XLX.,remain in my body as long as the stories of Rāma shall be in currency on
4872,SECTION XLX.,"earth. Let not this prove otherwise. O foremost of men, O descendant of"
4873,SECTION XLX.,"Raghu, may the Apsarās make me always hear of thy themes. O hero, as the"
4874,SECTION XLX.,winds scatter the clouds so I shall remove my anxiety by listening to
4875,SECTION XLX.,"thy nectar-like themes."" After Hanumān had said this, Rāma rose up from"
4876,SECTION XLX.,"his throne and having embraced Hanumān affectionately said, ""O foremost"
4877,SECTION XLX.,"of monkeys, what thou hast said, shall undoubtedly be carried out into"
4878,SECTION XLX.,action. As long as my stories shall be current on earth thy fame shall
4879,SECTION XLX.,exist and life shall be in thy body. And as long as the world shall
4880,SECTION XLX.,"exist my themes shall be related. I cannot, even at the sacrifice of my"
4881,SECTION XLX.,"life, release myself from the debts of one good service out of the many,"
4882,SECTION XLX.,"thou hast done for me, monkey; and I shall for ever remain indebted to"
4883,SECTION XLX.,"thee for thy last benefaction. Or let them wear out in me, for men, at"
4884,SECTION XLX.,"the time of danger, become worthy of having their benefits returned."""
4885,SECTION XLX.,"Having said this, Rāma took off from his neck a chain set with sapphires"
4886,SECTION XLX.,brilliant as the rays of the moon and placed it round the neck of
4887,SECTION XLX.,Hanumān. Like unto the mountain Sumeru beautified by the rising of the
4888,SECTION XLX.,"moon on its summit, Hanumān, the foremost of monkeys, appeared graceful"
4889,SECTION XLX.,"with the chain placed on his breast. And hearing the words of Rāghava,"
4890,SECTION XLX.,"the highly powerful monkeys, one by one, saluted Rāma, touching his feet"
4891,SECTION XLX.,and went away. Both Sugriva and the virtuous-souled Bibhishana embraced
4892,SECTION XLX.,Rāma and three of them were beside themselves with tears. And other
4893,SECTION XLX.,monkeys and Rākshasas were all moved with tears and sorrow to take leave
4894,SECTION XLX.,of Rāma. Having received favours thus from the high-souled Rāghava the
4895,SECTION XLX.,monkeys went away to their own houses like-unto bodied creatures leaving
4896,SECTION XLX.,"off their bodies. Thereupon the Rākshasas, bears, monkeys, having bowed"
4897,SECTION XLX.,"unto Rāma, the glory of the Raghu family and with their eyes full of"
4898,SECTION XLX.,"tears consequent upon his separation, went away to the countries from"

4914,SECTION LI.,"destruction of the vicious-souled Rāvana, with his relatives, sons and"

4922,SECTION LI.,"all regions carrying out your behests."" Hearing the words of Pushpaka,"
4923,SECTION LI.,the highly powerful Rāma said to the returning car stationed in the
4924,SECTION LI.,"welkin:—""O foremost of cars, Pushpaka, if such be the case, do thou come"

4951,SECTION LII.,"Having sent away the golden Pushpaka, the highly powerful Rāma entered"
4952,SECTION LII.,"the Asoka forest beautified by sandal, Aguru, Mangoe, dark sandal and"
4953,SECTION LII.,"Debadaru trees, and covered with Champaka, Aguru, Nāga, Kesara, Madhuka,"
4954,SECTION LII.,"Panasa, Sarja, Pārijāta, resembling smokeless fire, Sodhra, Neepa,"
4955,SECTION LII.,"Arjuna, Nāga, Saptaparna, Muktaka, Mandāra, Kadalee and various"
4956,SECTION LII.,"creepers, abounding in Priyanga, Kadamba, Vakula, Jambu, pomegranate,"
4957,SECTION LII.,"and Kadali trees, containing various flowers, picturesque, having many"
4958,SECTION LII.,"fruits, fragrant, decorated with new leaves and adorned with various"
4959,SECTION LII.,"other trees. There were many a tree, having profuse foliage and flowers"
4960,SECTION LII.,and covered with maddened black bees as if constructed by architects.
4961,SECTION LII.,"The forest-land was variegated and beautified by cuckoos, the ornaments"
4962,SECTION LII.,"of mangoe trees, black-bees and various birds of various colours."
4963,SECTION LII.,"Amongst the trees beautifying the forest some were gold-hued, some were"
4964,SECTION LII.,radiant as the flame of fire and some were like red collyrium. There
4965,SECTION LII.,"were various flowers, spreading fragrance and making garlands. And there"
4966,SECTION LII.,were various ponds filled with pure water. The stairs of those ponds
4967,SECTION LII.,were made of corals and the ground was of crystal. And they were all
4968,SECTION LII.,filled with lotuses and lilies. They were beautified with Chakrabakas
4969,SECTION LII.,and the banks were graced with variegated trees and flowers. And the
4970,SECTION LII.,forest was encompassed by stone walls and in the inside were dwelling
4971,SECTION LII.,many a Sārdula bird resembling _Vaiduryas_. All the trees in the forest
4972,SECTION LII.,"were filled with flowers. And the rocks there, covered with flowers"
4973,SECTION LII.,"falling down from trees, appeared like welkin beautified with stars. And"
4974,SECTION LII.,Rāma’s Asoka forest was like unto Indra’s Nandana and Kuvera’s
4975,SECTION LII.,Chitraratha made by Brahmā. Having entered the rich Asoka forest
4976,SECTION LII.,abounding in many seats and houses and creepers Rāma sat on an excellent
4977,SECTION LII.,"seat, covered with a beautiful coverlet and well constructed. Like unto"
4978,SECTION LII.,"Purandara with Sachi he took Sitā by the hand, made her sit and drink"
4979,SECTION LII.,the wine distilled in the province of Mira. And in no time the servants
4980,SECTION LII.,brought for him well-cooked meat and various fruits. Being inebriete the
4981,SECTION LII.,"beautiful Apsarās, well-skilled in the art of singing and dancing, began"
4982,SECTION LII.,to dance before Rāma in the company of Kinnaris. The virtuous-souled
4983,SECTION LII.,"Rāma, the foremost of those who know how to please, satisfied those"
4984,SECTION LII.,beautiful damsels adorned with various ornaments. And Sitā sitting by
4985,SECTION LII.,"him, he appeared like the effulgent Vasishtha in the company of"
4986,SECTION LII.,Arundhati. Being greatly delighted the celestial-like Rāma pleased every
4987,SECTION LII.,day Sitā resembling a celestial damsel. Sitā and Rāghava thus spent
4988,SECTION LII.,their days happily. And thus was spent the delightful winter giving all
4989,SECTION LII.,enjoyments. Enjoying various things the high-souled Rāma and Sitā spent
4990,SECTION LII.,"ten thousand years. Once on a time, having performed all the religious"
4991,SECTION LII.,"ceremonies, in the fore part of the day, Rāma, to spend the evening,"
4992,SECTION LII.,"entered the inner apartment. Sitā, too, having performed all religious"
4993,SECTION LII.,"ceremonies, at first attended to the service of her mothers-in-law."
4994,SECTION LII.,Thereupon wearing a beautifully coloured cloth and being adorned with
4995,SECTION LII.,various ornaments Sitā appeared before Rāma like unto Sachi approaching
4996,SECTION LII.,the king of celestials in heaven. And beholding the auspicious signs of
4997,SECTION LII.,pregnancy in his spouse Rāma attained to excessive delight. Thereupon he
4998,SECTION LII.,"said to the beautiful Sitā resembling a celestial damsel:—""O"
4999,SECTION LII.,Vaidehi—signs of pregnancy are manifest in thee. What desires of thine
5000,SECTION LII.,"can we satisfy?"" Smiling a little the daughter of Janaka said:—""O"
5001,SECTION LII.,"Rāghava, I wish to behold the holy hermitages. I wish to salute the"
5002,SECTION LII.,greatly effulgent Rishis living on fruits and roots and residing on the
5003,SECTION LII.,"banks of the Ganges. I greatly desire, O Rāma, that I may spend even one"
5004,SECTION LII.,"night in the hermitage of the Rishis living on fruits and roots."""
5005,SECTION LII.,"Whereto replied Rāma of unwearied actions, saying ""So be it. Believe me,"
5006,SECTION LII.,"O Vaidehi, that thou shalt undoubtedly go there to-morrow."" Having thus"
5007,SECTION LII.,"addressed Maithili, the daughter of Janaka, Rāma, the descendant of"

5019,SECTION LIII.,delightedly began to introduce many amusings talks before the

5021,SECTION LIII.,"Vadra, how do the inhabitants of the city and provinces talk about Sitā,"
5022,SECTION LIII.,"Bharata, Lakshmana, Satrughna and the mother Kaikeyi? The kings, when"
5023,SECTION LIII.,"they deviate from the paths of justice, become objects of censure in the"
5024,SECTION LIII.,"houses of men and even in the forests as well."" Rāma having said this,"
5025,SECTION LIII.,"Vadra with folded hands replied:—""O king, the citizens speak many good"
5026,SECTION LIII.,things about thee; besides they dilate upon many things in their own
5027,SECTION LIII.,houses regarding thine conquest acquired by the destruction of the
5028,SECTION LIII.,"Ten-necked demon."" Hearing the words of Vadra, Rāma said:—""Without"
5029,SECTION LIII.,"hiding any thing, do thou relate every thing from the beginning as they"
5030,SECTION LIII.,are; what good and bad things have been given vent to by the citizens.
5031,SECTION LIII.,Hearing the good and bad opinions of the citizens I shall desist from
5032,SECTION LIII.,bad actions and engage in good ones. Whatever vicious actions of mine
5033,SECTION LIII.,are talked of by subjects in cities and provinces do thou relate unto me
5034,SECTION LIII.,"confidently and fearlessly."" Hearing the sweet accents of Rāma, Vadra,"
5035,SECTION LIII.,"with a quiescent mind and folded palms, said:—""Hear, O king, I shall"
5036,SECTION LIII.,relate to thee all those unpleasant things frequently dwelt upon by
5037,SECTION LIII.,"people in court-yards, markets, public roads, forests and, gardens."
5038,SECTION LIII.,"Indeed Rāma hath accomplished a wonderfully hard work; our ancestors,"
5039,SECTION LIII.,"the celestials, the Dānavas—none heard of constructing a bridge over the"
5040,SECTION LIII.,ocean? Rāma hath slain the irrepressible Rāvana with his army and
5041,SECTION LIII.,"brought over the monkeys, bears and Rakhasas to his own side. Having"
5042,SECTION LIII.,"discomfitted Rāvana, in the encounter Rāma hath released Sitā, but not"
5043,SECTION LIII.,being the least enraged on account of her being touched by Rāvana he
5044,SECTION LIII.,hath brought her to his own city. Rāvana did forcibly place Sitā on his
5045,SECTION LIII.,lap; how can then Rāma enjoy delight in her company? Having taken her to
5046,SECTION LIII.,"the city of Lankā, Rāvana did keep her in the Asoka forest and Sitā was"
5047,SECTION LIII.,brought under the control of Rākshashes. Still Rāma hath not been worked

5050,SECTION LIII.,"King, the subjects thus talk of many things in cities and provinces."""
5051,SECTION LIII.,"Hearing those words of Vadra, Rāghava was greatly sorry and asked his"

5068,SECTION LIV.,"entered therein. And having saluted him, with folded palms he said to"

5075,SECTION LIV.,powerful Bharata at once got up from his seat and proceeded on foot.
5076,SECTION LIV.,Seeing Bharata’s departure the warder speedily went to Satrughna and
5077,SECTION LIV.,"with folded hands said:—""Do thou come, O foremost Raghus, the King"
5078,SECTION LIV.,"wisheth to behold thee."" Hearing the words of the warder Satrughna"
5079,SECTION LIV.,lowered his head and rising up speedily proceeded to Rāma. Thereupon
5080,SECTION LIV.,"returning, the warder, with folded hands, communicated unto Rāma, the"
5081,SECTION LIV.,arrivals of his brothers. So long Rāma was engaged poorly in anxious
5082,SECTION LIV.,meditation with his crown bent downwards. Informed of the princes’
5083,SECTION LIV.,"arrival he commanded the warder, ""Do thou soon bring the princes here."
5084,SECTION LIV.,"My life depends upon them. They are my dearest life."" Having obtained"
5085,SECTION LIV.,"Rāma’s command, the princes, clothed in white raiment, entered there,"
5086,SECTION LIV.,with folded palms and quiescent mind. Having entered there they saw that
5087,SECTION LIV.,Rāma’s countenance was shorn of beauty like unto the moon possessed by
5088,SECTION LIV.,"Rāhu, the setting sun and the withered lotus and his eyes were full of"
5089,SECTION LIV.,"tears. Having approached him quickly, and saluted his feet they"
5090,SECTION LIV.,anxiously sat there. Thereupon having wiped off his tears and embraced
5091,SECTION LIV.,them with his arms he raised up the princes and pressed them to take
5092,SECTION LIV.,"their seats. Thereupon he said—""You are mine all; you constitute my"

5105,SECTION LV.,"against my desire. Hear, what the citizens have been talking about me"
5106,SECTION LV.,and Sitā. The citizens as well as the inhabitants of provinces have been
5107,SECTION LV.,showering censures upon me. I have been pierced to the very vitals by
5108,SECTION LV.,those accusations. I have been born in the illustrious family of the
5109,SECTION LV.,high-souled Ikshwākus. Sitā hath been born also in the holy family of
5110,SECTION LV.,"the great Janaka; gentle Lakshmana, thou knowest how in the solitary"
5111,SECTION LV.,"forest of Dandaka, Sitā was stolen away by Rāvana and how have I slain"
5112,SECTION LV.,him. At that time even I was stricken with anxiety regarding Sitā that
5113,SECTION LV.,how I could take her home since she had resided in the house of the
5114,SECTION LV.,"Rākshasas. To secure my confidence, Sitā, in your very presence, entered"
5115,SECTION LV.,"fire. At that time, O Saumitri, fire, carrying sacrificial oblations and"
5116,SECTION LV.,the wind of the sky declared Sitā’s innocence before the celestials. In
5117,SECTION LV.,"the presence of all the Rishis and gods, the Sun and Moon announced the"
5118,SECTION LV.,"innocence of the daughter of Janaka. Indra, the king of the celestials,"
5119,SECTION LV.,himself handed over the chaste Sitā unto me in the island of Lankā. My
5120,SECTION LV.,"mind knoweth Sitā as chaste for ever. So, at that time I came back to"
5121,SECTION LV.,Ayodhyā with Sitā. But now a great sorrow consequent upon the censure of
5122,SECTION LV.,"the citizens and villagers hath pierced my heart. He, who is notorious"
5123,SECTION LV.,"on this earth and as long as that notoriety remains current, is classed"
5124,SECTION LV.,amongst the vile. Even the celestials speak ill of bad name—whereas fame
5125,SECTION LV.,is adored in all the regions. Therefore the high-souled exert their best
5126,SECTION LV.,"to acquire reputation. O foremost of men, what to speak of the daughter"
5127,SECTION LV.,of Janaka—I can even renounce my life and yourselves in fear of a bad
5128,SECTION LV.,name. Do ye therefore perceive into what great abyss of sorrow and
5129,SECTION LV.,ill-fame I have fallen. Up to this time I have never experienced such a
5130,SECTION LV.,"mighty grief. Do thou, O Lakshmana, next morning, ascending the car"
5131,SECTION LV.,"driven by Sumantra, take away Sitā to another country. There is a"
5132,SECTION LV.,picturesque hermitage of the high-souled Vālmiki situate on the Tamasā
5133,SECTION LV.,"on the Other side of the river Ganges. Do thou, O delight of Raghus,"
5134,SECTION LV.,"soon come back, leaving behind Sitā in that lovely place; Do thou carry"
5135,SECTION LV.,"out my words. Do thou not speak anything regarding Sitā’s banishment, O"
5136,SECTION LV.,"Saumitri, if dost thou request me to desist from this, it shall be the"
5137,SECTION LV.,"more unpleasant unto me. For my life and arms, do ye not proffer any"
5138,SECTION LV.,"request unto me regarding this, If so, you shall only endanger my"
5139,SECTION LV.,well-being and I shall ever regard you as my enemies. If you obey my
5140,SECTION LV.,"behests, do ye honor my words now. Do ye take away Sitā from here. Ere"
5141,SECTION LV.,this Sitā had communicated her intention of beholding the hermitages of
5142,SECTION LV.,ascetics on the banks of the Ganges. Let that desire of hers be now
5143,SECTION LV.,"satisfied."" While saying this, the eyes of the virtuous-souled Rāma were"
5144,SECTION LV.,"covered with tears. Sighing hard like unto an elephant, he, with a heart"
5145,SECTION LV.,"stricken with grief, departed to his own quarter in the company of his"

5156,SECTION LVI.,"an excellent seat on the car. At the command of the King, I shall take"
5157,SECTION LVI.,Sitā to the hermitage of the ascetics ever engaged in pious actions. Do
5158,SECTION LVI.,"thou soon bring the chariot here."" Obeying the mandate, and bringing a"
5159,SECTION LVI.,beautiful and holy car drawn by first-rate steeds and having excellent
5160,SECTION LVI.,"seats, he said to Saumitri, the enhancer of friends’ honor ""O lord, here"
5161,SECTION LVI.,"is the chariot ready—do thou now satisfy thine desire."" Hearing the"
5162,SECTION LVI.,"words of Sumantra, Lakshmana, the foremost of men, approached Sitā in"
5163,SECTION LVI.,"the inner apartment and said:—""O queen, thou didst request the king to"
5164,SECTION LVI.,show thee the hermitage—the king too did promise—he hath now commanded
5165,SECTION LVI.,"me to take thee there. Do thou therefore follow me, at the command of"
5166,SECTION LVI.,"the king. I shall, at his behest, take thee to the forest where dwell"
5167,SECTION LVI.,"many an ascetic."" Hearing the words of the high-souled Lakshmana, Jānaki"
5168,SECTION LVI.,attained to excessive delight and became anxious to go. Taking various
5169,SECTION LVI.,jewels and costly clothes she said to Lakshmana on the eve of her
5170,SECTION LVI.,"departure—""I shall confer these ornaments, these costly clothes and"
5171,SECTION LVI.,"riches on the female ascetics."" Saying ""We shall do the same,"" he made"
5172,SECTION LVI.,"Sitā ascend the car and remembering Rāma’s command proceeded, being"
5173,SECTION LVI.,"carried by quick-coursing steeds. Thereupon Sitā said to Lakshmana, the"
5174,SECTION LVI.,"enhancer of prosperity:—""O descendent of Raghu, I behold many"
5175,SECTION LVI.,inauspicious omens. My right eye and body are trembling. My mind is
5176,SECTION LVI.,growing depressed. It is stricken with anxiety and I have accordingly
5177,SECTION LVI.,grown restless. I behold the earth as void of all happiness. O thou fond
5178,SECTION LVI.,of brothers—hath thy brother met with any calamity? Are all my
5179,SECTION LVI.,"mothers-in-law and subjects well?"" Saying this Sitā, with folded hands,"
5180,SECTION LVI.,began to pray unto gods. Hearing this Lakshmana bowed unto her touching
5181,SECTION LVI.,"the ground with his crown, and though greatly sorry, said as if"
5182,SECTION LVI.,"delighted ""All well."" Thereupon having arrived at the hermitage situate"
5183,SECTION LVI.,on the banks of Gomati Lakshmana spent the night there. Thereupon at
5184,SECTION LVI.,"dawn he rose up and asked the charioteer to get the chariot ready,"
5185,SECTION LVI.,"saying, ""Like unto the powerful Mahādeva we shall hold the waters of the"
5186,SECTION LVI.,"Bhāgirathi on our head."" Thereupon Sumantra yoked the horses, gifted"
5187,SECTION LVI.,"with the fleet course of the mind, to the chariot and with folded hands"
5188,SECTION LVI.,"said to Sitā. ""Do thou ascend the car."" According to the request of the"
5189,SECTION LVI.,"intelligent charioteer, Sitā, with Lakshmana, ascended that excellent"
5190,SECTION LVI.,"conveyance. In no time the daughter of Janaka, having expansive eyes,"
5191,SECTION LVI.,"arrived at the banks of the Ganges removing all sins, Reaching the"
5192,SECTION LVI.,"currents of Bhāgirathi before noon Lakshmana, on beholding her, cried"
5193,SECTION LVI.,"aloud. Thereupon beholding Lakshmana thus distressed, Sitā, conversant"
5194,SECTION LVI.,"with piety, waxing anxious said. ""Why art thou weeping, Lakshmana? I"
5195,SECTION LVI.,"have reached the banks of Janhavi, for which I have so long desired. So"
5196,SECTION LVI.,this is the time for rejoicing and do not give me pain at this time. O
5197,SECTION LVI.,"foremost of men, thou dost spend thine days and nights in the company of"
5198,SECTION LVI.,"Rāma, Thou hast left him for two days only—art thou sorry for this?"
5199,SECTION LVI.,Lakshmana—Rāma is also dearer than my life—but I am not so sorry—do thou
5200,SECTION LVI.,not be therefore overwhelmed with grief. Do thou take me to the other
5201,SECTION LVI.,side of the Ganges so that I may behold the ascetics and confer upon
5202,SECTION LVI.,them clothes and ornaments. Thereupon saluting them duly and spending a
5203,SECTION LVI.,"night we shall return to the capital. I am also anxious to sec Rāma,"

5219,SECTION LVII.,sorrow ordered the sailors to move on. Thereupon having reached the
5220,SECTION LVII.,"other side of Bhāgirathi, Lakshmana, with subdued voice and folded"
5221,SECTION LVII.,"palms, said to Sitā—""O daughter of the king of Videha, this hath pierced"

5227,SECTION LVII.,"death. Beholding him thus overwhelmed, Sitā said ""What is the matter,"
5228,SECTION LVII.,"Lakshmana? I do not understand anything, Do thou speak out everything"
5229,SECTION LVII.,plainly unto me. I find thee beside thyself (with grief); is it all well
5230,SECTION LVII.,"with the kingdom? In the name of the king, do thou give out unto me, the"

5259,SECTION LVIII.,mighty iniquity in my pristine existence or brought about separation
5260,SECTION LVIII.,between a husband and wife and for that Rāma hath renounced me albeit I
5261,SECTION LVIII.,"am pure and chaste. O son of Sumitrā, the affliction of residing in the"
5262,SECTION LVIII.,forest appeared to me as pleasure ere this for I knew that I would be
5263,SECTION LVIII.,"able to serve Rāma’s feet. But how shall I, O gentle one, live in the"
5264,SECTION LVIII.,hermitage being divorced from all my kith and kin? And being afflicted
5265,SECTION LVIII.,to whom shall I express my sorrow? What reply shall I offer unto the
5266,SECTION LVIII.,ascetics when they shall ask me ’Child; why hath the high-souled Rāghava
5267,SECTION LVIII.,"renounced thee? What sin hast thou committed?’ O Saumitri, shall I just"
5268,SECTION LVIII.,renounce my life in the waters of Jāhnavi? But I desist from this for it
5269,SECTION LVIII.,"shall bring about the termination of my husband’s race. O Saumitri, do"
5270,SECTION LVIII.,thou carry out the orders thou hast received. By renouncing this
5271,SECTION LVIII.,"wretched wight do thou satisfy the King’s orders. But hear, what I say."
5272,SECTION LVIII.,"Without making any distinction, do thou, in my name, with folded hands,"
5273,SECTION LVIII.,bow unto my mothers-in-law and then ask the well-being of the kingdom.
5274,SECTION LVIII.,"Thereupon saluting the pious King do thou address him, in my name,"
5275,SECTION LVIII.,"saying:—’Thou knowest, O Rāghava, that Sitā is pure, ever devoted unto"
5276,SECTION LVIII.,"thee and engaged in thy well-being. She knows it full well, that afraid"
5277,SECTION LVIII.,of a bad name thou hast renounced her. It is her duty to put a stop to
5278,SECTION LVIII.,thy ill-name and censure; for thou art her excellent refuge.’ Do thou
5279,SECTION LVIII.,tell further-more that king established in righteousness to treat the
5280,SECTION LVIII.,"citizens as his brothers, to acquire piety by protecting his subjects"
5281,SECTION LVIII.,duly—for this is the greatest morality and by this may be acquired
5282,SECTION LVIII.,excellent fame. Tell him that I am not sorry for my person—my greatest
5283,SECTION LVIII.,sorrow is that the citizens have vilified me. Husband is a woman’s
5284,SECTION LVIII.,god—her friend and spiritual guide. It is proper therefore to work out
5285,SECTION LVIII.,"husband’s well-being even at the sacrifice of life. Do thou, O"
5286,SECTION LVIII.,"Lakshmana, communicate it in short unto Rāma, in my name; Do thou go now"
5287,SECTION LVIII.,"and behold the signs of pregnancy are manifest in me."" Sitā having said"
5288,SECTION LVIII.,"this, Lakshmana, with a bewildered heart, saluted her touching the"
5289,SECTION LVIII.,"ground with his head, he could not speak more. Thereupon bewailing aloud"
5290,SECTION LVIII.,"and circumambulating her, he, meditating a little, said. ""What art thou"
5291,SECTION LVIII.,"speaking unto me, O worshipful dame? O thou having no sin, up to this"
5292,SECTION LVIII.,time I have not seen any portion of thy beautiful person but feet. This
5293,SECTION LVIII.,"is a solitary forest and besides the worshipful Rāma, is not present"
5294,SECTION LVIII.,"here—under these circumstances how can I cast looks upon thee?"" Having"
5295,SECTION LVIII.,addressed Sitā in this wise Lakshmana again sent for a boat and
5296,SECTION LVIII.,ascending it ordered the boatmen to go. Thereupon having reached the
5297,SECTION LVIII.,other side and being beside himself with sorrow and grief he speedily
5298,SECTION LVIII.,ascended the car. And casting his looks behind while proceeding he
5299,SECTION LVIII.,"espied that Sitā, on the other side of the Ganges, was roving wildly"
5300,SECTION LVIII.,like one having none to look after her. Looking again and again when
5301,SECTION LVIII.,Sitā saw that Lakshmana and the chariot have gone beyond the range of
5302,SECTION LVIII.,"her vision, she became overwhelmed with anxiety and grief. Being sunk in"
5303,SECTION LVIII.,"grief and pressed down with the weight of sorrow on not beholding Rāma,"
5304,SECTION LVIII.,"the foremost of the illustrious, the chaste Sitā began to cry aloud in"
5305,SECTION LVIII.,the forest resounded with the notes of peacocks.

5313,SECTION LIX.,"approached the great Vālmiki, well-established in asceticism. And"
5314,SECTION LIX.,"saluting him they all communicated unto him Sitā’s bewailings and said,"
5315,SECTION LIX.,"""O great sir, we do not know the wife of what great man, beautiful like"
5316,SECTION LIX.,"the very Lakshmi, and not seen before, is crying aloud very poorly? It"
5317,SECTION LIX.,"is better that thou shouldst see her once. That beautiful damsel, like a"
5318,SECTION LIX.,"goddess falling from heaven being bewildered, is waiting on the banks of"
5319,SECTION LIX.,the river. We saw her alone crying aloud being overwhelmed with sorrow
5320,SECTION LIX.,and grief as if she had none to look after her. A damsel like her should
5321,SECTION LIX.,not be subject to such a condition. She did not appear to us to be a
5322,SECTION LIX.,woman. Do thou receive her duly. She is near the hermitage and so hath
5323,SECTION LIX.,"come to seek thy shelter. O illustrious Sir, she is on the look out for"
5324,SECTION LIX.,"a protector—do thou protect her."" The pious Vālmiki could perceive every"
5325,SECTION LIX.,thing by virtue of his asceticism; and ascertaining the truth of the
5326,SECTION LIX.,"words of the Rishi boys by the power of his understanding, he, with"
5327,SECTION LIX.,"quick steps, approached Sitā. And the disciples followed that"
5328,SECTION LIX.,high-minded ascetic. Thereupon proceeding a little on foot with Arghya
5329,SECTION LIX.,"in his hands, the wise Vālmiki reached the banks of the river and saw"
5330,SECTION LIX.,that Rāghava’s spouse was bewailing like a helpless woman. Having
5331,SECTION LIX.,gladdened a little the aggrieved Sitā by virtue of his own effulgence
5332,SECTION LIX.,"the great ascetic Vālmiki addressed her in following sweet accents. ""O"
5333,SECTION LIX.,"chaste damsel, thou art the daughter-in-law of Daçaratha, the beloved"
5334,SECTION LIX.,wife of Rāma and the daughter of Janaka; thy coming here is auspicious.
5335,SECTION LIX.,"I am apprized, by virtue of asceticism and meditation, of the object of"
5336,SECTION LIX.,"thy coming here. O great lady, I am also fully aware that thou art by"
5337,SECTION LIX.,all means chaste. In fact I am conscious of all the incidents in the
5338,SECTION LIX.,"three worlds. By the eyes of asceticism, I perceive, O daughter of"
5339,SECTION LIX.,"Janaka, that thou art innocent. Thou hast come under my shelter, O"
5340,SECTION LIX.,"Vaidehi—be thou consoled. O child, the pious ascetics live around my"
5341,SECTION LIX.,hermitage. They shall daily take care of thee as their daughter. Do thou
5342,SECTION LIX.,"accept this Arghya now, and confiding in me do thou remove thy grief. Be"
5343,SECTION LIX.,"not sorry for anything; consider that thou hast come to thy own home."""
5344,SECTION LIX.,"Hearing the wonderful words of the great ascetic, Sitā humbly touched"
5345,SECTION LIX.,"his feet and said ""Thy desire shall be fulfilled."" Saying this, she,"
5346,SECTION LIX.,"with folded hands, followed the ascetic. Beholding the great ascetic and"
5347,SECTION LIX.,"Sitā approach, the wives of the Rishis, delighted neared them and"
5348,SECTION LIX.,"said:—"" Do thou come, O foremost of Rishis, thou hast arrived here after"
5349,SECTION LIX.,"a long time. We all bow unto thee—do thou order what we shall do."""
5350,SECTION LIX.,"Hearing their words the great Vālmiki replied in worthy accents—""This"
5351,SECTION LIX.,"Sitā is the wife of the intelligent Rāma, the daughter-in-law of"
5352,SECTION LIX.,Daçaratha and the daughter of Janaka. She has now come to our hermitage.
5353,SECTION LIX.,"She is chaste and innocent, still her husband hath renounced her. So we"
5354,SECTION LIX.,should all protect her. She is worthy of your reverence—specially while
5355,SECTION LIX.,"such is the order of mine—your preceptor. So, do ye all take care of her"
5356,SECTION LIX.,"with great affection."" Having consigned the charge of Sitā unto the"
5357,SECTION LIX.,"hands of the female ascetics, the great and illustrious ascetic Vālmiki,"

5368,SECTION LX.,"to the expert charioteer Sumantra. ""Do thou perceive Rāma’s grief"
5369,SECTION LX.,consequent upon the separation from Sitā. His spouse—the daughter of
5370,SECTION LX.,"Janaka, is perfectly pure; what can be more painful than that Rāma is"
5371,SECTION LX.,"living alone having renounced her? It is clear unto me, O Sumantra, that"
5372,SECTION LX.,"this separation of Rāma, hath been brought about by the influence of"
5373,SECTION LX.,"destiny—for it is hard to get over accident. Even that Rāma, who, when"
5374,SECTION LX.,"enraged, is capable of slaying the celestials, Gandharvas, Asuras and"
5375,SECTION LX.,"Rākshasas, hath been engaged in the worship of destiny. Formerly did"
5376,SECTION LX.,"Rāma go through miseries, residing in the forest of Dandaka, at the"
5377,SECTION LX.,command of his sire for fourteen years. But this banishment of Sitā
5378,SECTION LX.,"appears to me as exceedingly painful and most ruthless. O charioteer,"
5379,SECTION LX.,the opinion of the citizens is by no means just; consequently what shall
5380,SECTION LX.,"we gain by performing such a bad action for fame as the exile of Sitā?"""
5381,SECTION LX.,"Hearing those words of Lakshmana, the wise Sumantra reverentially"
5382,SECTION LX.,"replied:—""Be not aggrieved for Sitā, O Saumitri. Formerly in the"
5383,SECTION LX.,presence of thy sire the Brahmananas related this account of Sitā’s
5384,SECTION LX.,exile. Rāma shall be deprived of all happiness and be separated from his
5385,SECTION LX.,"dear wife; what more, the virtuous-souled Rāma, having long arms, shall,"
5386,SECTION LX.,"under the influence of time, renounce thee, Sitā, Satrughna and Bharata."
5387,SECTION LX.,"O Lakshmana, when Durbasa was addressed by the king Daçaratha as to thy"
5388,SECTION LX.,future he replied in the above way. I have told thee the same. Do thou
5389,SECTION LX.,"not communicate this unto Satrughna, Bharata or any body. O foremost of"
5390,SECTION LX.,"men, Durbasa said this unto Daçaratha before me, Vasishtha and other"
5391,SECTION LX.,"great men. Hearing the words of Rishi, Daçaratha, the foremost of men,"
5392,SECTION LX.,"said unto me, ’O charioteer, do not reveal this secret to any body.’ O"
5393,SECTION LX.,"gentle one, it is not proper by any means to falsify the words of the"
5394,SECTION LX.,"king Daçaratha. I shall always, very carefully, carry out his orders. It"
5395,SECTION LX.,is not proper to reveal this mystery before thee. Still I do so for thy
5396,SECTION LX.,curiosity hath been greatly excited. Though this mystery was
5397,SECTION LX.,communicated formerly by the king Daçaratha and though it is not proper
5398,SECTION LX.,"to reveal it to any body, still I express it before thee that thou mayst"
5399,SECTION LX.,"not, on hearing it, be worked up with sorrow; for destiny is hard to be"
5400,SECTION LX.,got over. And it is by the influence of that destiny that thou hast met
5401,SECTION LX.,"with such a sorrow and grief. However, do thou not reveal this secret"
5402,SECTION LX.,"unto Satrughna and Bharata."" Hearing these grave and important words of"

5412,SECTION LXI.,"ascetic Durbāsā, the son of Atri, resided for a year in the holy"
5413,SECTION LXI.,"hermitage of Vasishtha. At that time thy sire, the highly effulgent and"
5414,SECTION LXI.,"illustrious Daçaratha, with a view to see his high-souled priest"
5415,SECTION LXI.,"Vasishtha, repaired there. He saw the great ascetic Durbāsā, burning"
5416,SECTION LXI.,"like the sun in his effulgence, seated on the right hand side of"
5417,SECTION LXI.,Vasishtha. Thereupon he humbly saluted those two leading ascetics. And
5418,SECTION LXI.,"they too, welcoming him, received him duly with seat, water to wash"
5419,SECTION LXI.,"feet, Arghya, fruits and roots. Then he lived there in the company of"
5420,SECTION LXI.,"the ascetics. Thereupon during the noon, all those ascetics, seated"
5421,SECTION LXI.,"there, began to dwell upon various pleasant topics. During an interval"
5422,SECTION LXI.,"Daçaratha, with folded hands and uplifted arms, said to the high-souled"
5423,SECTION LXI.,"son of Atri—Durbāsā, having asceticism for his wealth. ’O illustrious"
5424,SECTION LXI.,"Sir, how long shall my family remain in existence? What is the extent of"
5425,SECTION LXI.,the lease of life granted to Rāma and my other sons? How long shall the
5426,SECTION LXI.,descendants of Rāma live? And what shall be the end of my race? Do thou
5427,SECTION LXI.,relate all this unto me.’ Hearing the words of the king Daçaratha the
5428,SECTION LXI.,"highly effulgent Durbāsā, replied:—’Hear, the early history, O king."
5429,SECTION LXI.,"During the encounter between the celestials and Asuras, the demons,"
5430,SECTION LXI.,being remonstrated with by the celestials sought shelter of the wife of
5431,SECTION LXI.,Vrigu—thy priest. Vrigu’s wife having promised them help they lived
5432,SECTION LXI.,"there fearlessly. Having beheld the demons thus helped by Vriju’s wife,"
5433,SECTION LXI.,"Hari, the king of the celestials, enraged, chopped off her head with his"
5434,SECTION LXI.,"sharp discus. And angry on beholding his wife slain, Vrigu, imprecated a"
5435,SECTION LXI.,"curse on Vishnu, the slayer of enemies’ race, saying—""Being beside"
5436,SECTION LXI.,"thyself with anger thou hast slain my wife, not worthy of being killed;"
5437,SECTION LXI.,"therefore, O Janārddana, thou shalt be born in the region of mortals."
5438,SECTION LXI.,And there thou shalt remain separated from thy spouse for many long
5439,SECTION LXI.,"years."" Having imprecated this curse, Vrigu was greatly pained and being"
5440,SECTION LXI.,"propitiated by his adoration, Vishnu, fond of disciples, said: ""Having"
5441,SECTION LXI.,"slain Rāvana and others, I shall be, for the behoof of mankind, subject"
5442,SECTION LXI.,"to this imprecation."" O bestower of kings, the highly effulgent Vishnu,"
5443,SECTION LXI.,"thus imprecated by Vrigu in the days of yore, hath been born as thy son"
5444,SECTION LXI.,in this birth and hath been celebrated under the appellation of Rāma. O
5445,SECTION LXI.,"conferrer of honors, for sooth shall Rāma partake of the fruits of"
5446,SECTION LXI.,Vrigu’s curse. He shall reign in Ayodhyā for a long time. All his
5447,SECTION LXI.,followers shall be happy and prosperous. Having reigned for eleven
5448,SECTION LXI.,thousand years Rāma shall repair to the region of Brahmā. None shall be
5449,SECTION LXI.,able to vanquish him. He shall celebrate many a horse-sacrifice with
5450,SECTION LXI.,profuse gifts and shall establish many royal families. He shall beget on
5451,SECTION LXI.,Sitā two sons.’ Having thus related unto Daçaratha the past and future
5452,SECTION LXI.,of his family the highly effulgent great ascetic Durbāsā became silent.
5453,SECTION LXI.,"He being silent—the great King Daçaratha, having bowed unto the two"
5454,SECTION LXI.,"high-souled ascetics, again returned to his city Ayodhyā. I had heard"

5456,SECTION LXI.,are lying in my heart. Rishis’ words shall never prove fruitless.
5457,SECTION LXI.,According to the words of Rishi Rāma shall install two sons of Sitā in

5474,SECTION LXII.,became greatly sorry stricken with the thought as to what he should

5481,SECTION LXII.,"of tears. Being greatly pained at the sight, Saumitri touched his feet"

5486,SECTION LXII.,"grieve, O foremost of men, for such is the course of time. The"
5487,SECTION LXII.,intelligent people like thee do not grieve. Where there is growth there
5488,SECTION LXII.,"is decay, where there is prosperity there is ruin, and where there is"
5489,SECTION LXII.,"birth there is death. Therefore attachment unto wife, sons, friends and"
5490,SECTION LXII.,"riches is not proper, for surely shall be brought about separation with"
5491,SECTION LXII.,"them. Whilst thou canst control thyself and thy mind, shouldst thou not"
5492,SECTION LXII.,be able to bear this trifling pain of separation? Leading men like
5493,SECTION LXII.,"thyself are never overwhelmed by all these things. O Rāghava, thou shalt"
5494,SECTION LXII.,"again be blamed by the people. In fear of this calumny, O sing that thou"
5495,SECTION LXII.,hast renounced Maithili. And if dost thou grieve for that spouse thy

5497,SECTION LXII.,"thou restore thyself patiently, O foremost of men. Do thou give up this"
5498,SECTION LXII.,"weakness and be not sorry."" The intelligent Lakshmana, the son of"

5516,SECTION LXIII.,"therefore call here men, or women, priests or councillors who have come"
5517,SECTION LXIII.,for business. For sooth do a king falls into the dreadful hell where the
5518,SECTION LXIII.,"wind doth not blow, who does not daily look into his state affairs. I"
5519,SECTION LXIII.,"have heard, O foremost of men, that there lived in the days of yore a"
5520,SECTION LXIII.,"highly illustrious, truthful and pure-minded king, ever devoted unto the"
5521,SECTION LXIII.,"Brāhmanas, by the name of Nriga. Once on a time at the sacred pilgrimage"
5522,SECTION LXIII.,of Pushpaka that king conferred upon the Brāhmanas one _Koti_ of kine
5523,SECTION LXIII.,with calves adorned with golden ornaments. Accidentally on that
5524,SECTION LXIII.,"occasion, a cow with calf belonging to a poor Brahman, living upon low"
5525,SECTION LXIII.,"means, was given away along with other kine. Undergoing hunger and"
5526,SECTION LXIII.,"thirst, the master of that lost cow travelled for a long time in many"
5527,SECTION LXIII.,places in search of it. Thereupon having reached the province of
5528,SECTION LXIII.,Kanakhal he espied his own cow in the house of a Brāhmana. The cow was
5529,SECTION LXIII.,well kept and the young one was grown up. Thereupon the Brahman called
5530,SECTION LXIII.,"the cow by the name given by him saying ’Savalā, come.’ The cow heard"
5531,SECTION LXIII.,that and recognizing the voice of the Brahman followed him. And he
5532,SECTION LXIII.,"preceded her burning like fire. And the Brāhmana, in whose house the cow"
5533,SECTION LXIII.,"so long remained, speedily pursued her and approaching the ascetic said."
5534,SECTION LXIII.,’This cow is mine. The king Nriga conferred this upon me.’ So there
5535,SECTION LXIII.,arose a great quarrel between the two learned Brāhmanas. And thus
5536,SECTION LXIII.,quarreling they both approached him who had given away the cow. And
5537,SECTION LXIII.,though they waited for a long time at the gate they did not obtain
5538,SECTION LXIII.,permission to enter the palace. Thereat both of them were greatly
5539,SECTION LXIII.,"engraged and imprecated dreadful curses, saying ’Since thou hast not"
5540,SECTION LXIII.,granted us an interview though we have been waiting here for a long
5541,SECTION LXIII.,"time, thou shalt, by our curse, remain invisible, being a lizard. Thou"
5542,SECTION LXIII.,shalt in this state live in a den for many hundred and thousand years.
5543,SECTION LXIII.,When Vishnu assuming a human person shall be born in the Vasudeva family
5544,SECTION LXIII.,of Yadavas and enhance their glory he shall liberate thee from the

5568,SECTION LXIV.,"the departure of the Brāhmanas he sent for his priest, minister, the"
5569,SECTION LXIV.,citizens and subjects and filled with sorrow said:—’Do ye all hear
5570,SECTION LXIV.,attentively my words. Having imprecated a dreadful curse upon me the
5571,SECTION LXIV.,"jolly saint Nārada and the ascetic Parvata have speedily, like the wind,"
5572,SECTION LXIV.,"repaired to the region of Brahmā. Do ye therefore, even today, place the"
5573,SECTION LXIV.,"prince Vasu on the throne, and let the architects prepare a pleasant den"
5574,SECTION LXIV.,for me. Living therein I shall waste the curse of the Brahmans. Let the
5575,SECTION LXIV.,"architects dig one den to protect me against the rains, one against the"
5576,SECTION LXIV.,affliction of the winter and one against the distresses of summer. Let
5577,SECTION LXIV.,them enhance the picturesqueness of those dens by planting many trees
5578,SECTION LXIV.,having profuse branches and fruits and flowers. As long as time shall
5579,SECTION LXIV.,not change so long I shall spend my days happily in the den. For half a
5580,SECTION LXIV.,league on all sides around me let flower trees be planted.’ Having made
5581,SECTION LXIV.,those arrangements and placed Vasu on the throne the king Nriga
5582,SECTION LXIV.,"said:—’Do not swerve from the path of morality, O my son, and do thou"
5583,SECTION LXIV.,duly govern the subjects according to the custom of the Kshatryas. Thou
5584,SECTION LXIV.,"hast seen, with thine own eyes, the curse that the Brāhmanas have given"
5585,SECTION LXIV.,me being enraged for a very trifling folly of mine. Do thou not repent
5586,SECTION LXIV.,"for me. My son, time is the lord of happiness and sorrow; it is by the"

5588,SECTION LXIV.,must meet with what is kept in store by destiny; they must go where they
5589,SECTION LXIV.,are bound for and they must acquire what is set apart for them. Pristine
5590,SECTION LXIV.,"actions are the root of all these; so, be not sorry, O my son.’ O"
5591,SECTION LXIV.,"foremost of men, having given this advice unto his son, the highly"
5592,SECTION LXIV.,illustrious king Nriga proceeded to live in the sweet fragrant den.
5593,SECTION LXIV.,Having entered the den filled with many jewels the high-souled king

5606,SECTION LXV.,"Rāma, the descendant of Ikshwāku, began again with themes instinct with"
5607,SECTION LXV.,"morality:—""There lived a highly pious and powerful king by the name of"
5608,SECTION LXV.,Nimi. He was the twelfth of Ikshwāku’s sons. That powerful king made a
5609,SECTION LXV.,picturesque city like that of the celestials near the hermitage of
5610,SECTION LXV.,Gautama. The name of that beautiful city was Vaijayanta and the highly
5611,SECTION LXV.,illustrious royal saint used to live there. Having thus reared a highly
5612,SECTION LXV.,picturesque city he thought of worshipping the deity by celebrating a
5613,SECTION LXV.,sacrifice for the satisfaction of his sire. Having thus resolved and
5614,SECTION LXV.,"invited his sire Ikshwāku the son of Manu, he first welcomed the"
5615,SECTION LXV.,"celestial saint. Nimi the descendant of Ikshwāku, then welcomed the"
5616,SECTION LXV.,"saints Atri, Angiras and Vrigu having asceticism for their wealth."
5617,SECTION LXV.,"Thereupon Vasishtha said to Nimi, the foremost of royal saints—’I have"
5618,SECTION LXV.,already been engaged by Indra. Do thou therefore wait as long as his
5619,SECTION LXV.,sacrifice is not finished there.’ After the departure of Vasishtha the
5620,SECTION LXV.,great Gautama engaged in the satisfaction of Vasistha’s duties. And the
5621,SECTION LXV.,high-souled Vasishtha too engaged in Indra’s sacrifice. On the other
5622,SECTION LXV.,hand having united all the Brahmans the great king began to celebrate
5623,SECTION LXV.,the sacrifice extending over five thousand years near his city by the
5624,SECTION LXV.,side of the Himalaya. Thereupon having finished the sacrifice of Indra
5625,SECTION LXV.,"there came to the King, the blameless and the illustrious Rishi"
5626,SECTION LXV.,Vashishtha. Finding Gautama engaged in his room he was exceedingly
5627,SECTION LXV.,enraged. Thereupon he waited there for some time to see the King. On
5628,SECTION LXV.,that day the royal saint Nimi was deeply asleep. And not beholding the
5629,SECTION LXV.,King the high-souled Vasishtha was greatly angry and said:—’Since thou
5630,SECTION LXV.,"hast, O King, engaged another neglecting me, thy body shall remain"
5631,SECTION LXV.,"senseless.’ Thereupon hearing the curse of Vasishtha, the king got up."
5632,SECTION LXV.,There beside himself with ire he said—’I was unconscious in sleep—still

5654,SECTION LXVI.,and said:—’O illustrious god of gods! O thou lotus-sprung! By the

5659,SECTION LXVI.,"self-sprung Brahmā, of unmitigated prowess, replied. ’O great one, do"
5660,SECTION LXVI.,"thou enter into the vital energy of Mitra and Varuna; and even then, O"
5661,SECTION LXVI.,"foremost of twice-born ones, thou shalt not be born of a woman and being"

5663,SECTION LXVI.,"Brahmā having said this, Vasishtha, saluting and circumambulating him,"
5664,SECTION LXVI.,repaired to the region of Varuna. At that time Mitra in conjunction with

5705,SECTION LXVII.,"there sprang up two foremost Brahmin saints, from the vital energy"

5709,SECTION LXVII.,was thrown into the pot Mitra discharged his own on Urvasi’s account
5710,SECTION LXVII.,which was the source of Agastya’s birth. Into the pot in which Mitra’s

5712,SECTION LXVII.,were mixed up. Thereupon after some time from the energies of both Mitra
5713,SECTION LXVII.,and Varuna sprang up the effulgent Vasishtha—the priest of Ikshwāku. O
5714,SECTION LXVII.,"gentle one, the highly effulgent Ikshwāku appointed that blameless Rishi"
5715,SECTION LXVII.,as the priest of out family as soon as he was born. I have thus

5720,SECTION LXVII.,"and servants, began to protect that body with unguents, garlands and"
5721,SECTION LXVII.,"clothes. Thereupon at the end of the sacrifice Vrigu said ’O king, I am"

5723,SECTION LXVII.,"celestials, highly pleased, addressed the consciousness of Nimi saying"
5724,SECTION LXVII.,"’O royal saint, do thou accept boons; where shall we place thy"
5725,SECTION LXVII.,consciousness?’ Thereupon being addressed by the celestials the
5726,SECTION LXVII.,consciousness said ’I may live in the eyes of the celestials.’ They
5727,SECTION LXVII.,"agreed to it and said ’O lord of earth, for thee, their eyes shall be"

5870,SECTION LXX.,"the subjects."" Being thus addressed Lakshmana issued out of the house"
5871,SECTION LXX.,and saw that a dog was waiting at the gate. Casting its looks around it
5872,SECTION LXX.,was again and again barking. Beholding it in that plight the valiant
5873,SECTION LXX.,"Lakshmana said ""O generous sir, what business has brought thee hither—do"
5874,SECTION LXX.,"thou relate it confidentially."" Hearing the words of Lakshmana the dog"
5875,SECTION LXX.,"replied—""I wish to relate it unto Rāma, of unwearied actions, who is the"
5876,SECTION LXX.,"refuge of all creatures and who declares fearlessness unto all."" Hearing"
5877,SECTION LXX.,the words of the dog Lakshmana entered the beautiful palace to relate it
5878,SECTION LXX.,unto Rāma. And having communicated it unto Rāma he issued out and said
5879,SECTION LXX.,"to the dog:—""If thou hast anything true to speak thou mayst come and"
5880,SECTION LXX.,"communicate it unto the king."" Hearing the words of Lakshmana the dog"
5881,SECTION LXX.,"said—""We cannot enter into the houses of divinities, kings and Brāhmanas"
5882,SECTION LXX.,"nor can we go there where is fire, Indra, the sun or the wind, for we"
5883,SECTION LXX.,are the vilest born; so I cannot enter there. For king is the
5884,SECTION LXX.,"personification of virtue and specially the king Rāma is truthful, well"
5885,SECTION LXX.,versed in the science of fighting and ever engaged in the welfare of all
5886,SECTION LXX.,beings. He is perfectly cognizant of where the six qualities are to be
5887,SECTION LXX.,"applied—master of morality, knoweth all, seeth all and the best of"
5888,SECTION LXX.,"beautiful. He is the moon, death, Yama, Kuvera, the giver of riches,"
5889,SECTION LXX.,"fire, Indra, the sun and Varuna. O Saumitri, do thou go and communicate"
5890,SECTION LXX.,unto the king protecting his subjects that without his permission I do
5891,SECTION LXX.,"not wish to go there."" Thereupon the highly effulgent and noble-minded"
5892,SECTION LXX.,"Lakshmana entered the palace and said to Rāma:—""O thou having long arms,"
5893,SECTION LXX.,O thou the enhancer of Kausalyā’s joy—I have communicated thine orders—I
5894,SECTION LXX.,"shall relate shortly everything regarding that; do thou hear. That dog,"
5895,SECTION LXX.,"as a beggar, is waiting at the gate for thy commands."" Whereto Rāma"
5896,SECTION LXX.,"replied:—""Bring him speedily here who is waiting at the gate for"
5897,SECTION LXX.,"business."""

5905,SECTION LXXI.,"the dog and informed Rāma, who, on beholding it, said—""Do thou"
5906,SECTION LXXI.,"communicate thy desire unto me; be not afraid."" Thereupon beholding the"
5907,SECTION LXXI.,"king Rāma, the dog, having his head cut off, said ""The king is the"
5908,SECTION LXXI.,protector of animals and their lord. The king is awake when the subjects
5909,SECTION LXXI.,are asleep and he protects them. By administering the laws properly the
5910,SECTION LXXI.,king protects piety. Without his shelter the subjects meet with
5911,SECTION LXXI.,destruction. The king is the lord and father of the whole universe. He
5912,SECTION LXXI.,"is time, he is Yuga and he is the creation, mobile and immobile. He is"
5913,SECTION LXXI.,called _Dharma_ because he holdeth all. It is _Dharma_ (virtue) that
5914,SECTION LXXI.,upholdeth all mankind. It is by Dharma that the three worlds are being
5915,SECTION LXXI.,preserved. It is _Dharma_ or virtue that thwarts the enemies. It is
5916,SECTION LXXI.,virtue that governs the subjects duly. It is for this that virtue is
5917,SECTION LXXI.,called _Dhārana_ or the holder. The virtue of preservation is the
5918,SECTION LXXI.,greatest and confers fruits in after life. There is nothing like virtue
5919,SECTION LXXI.,"hard to acquire in this world. Charity, kindness, honoring the pious and"
5920,SECTION LXXI.,innocent conduct constitute the chief virtues; for by those the
5921,SECTION LXXI.,"well-being of this life and the next is brought about. O Rāghava, O thou"
5922,SECTION LXXI.,of firms vows—thou art an example of examples. Thou art cognizant of the
5923,SECTION LXXI.,"conduct of the pious. Thou art like an ocean, the refuge of all virtues."
5924,SECTION LXXI.,"O foremost of kings, out of ignorance, I have spoken unto thee so many"
5925,SECTION LXXI.,"things. With my head downwards, I beg for thy satisfaction. Be not"
5926,SECTION LXXI.,"offended with me."" Hearing those wise words of the dog, Rāma said—""What"
5927,SECTION LXXI.,"shall I do for thee? Do thou mention it confidentially."" Whereto the dog"
5928,SECTION LXXI.,"replied, saying:—""It is by piety that a king governs his kingdom—it is"
5929,SECTION LXXI.,"by virtue that a king protects his subjects, becomes a refuge unto all"
5930,SECTION LXXI.,"and removes the fear of his men. Keeping an eye on this, O Rāma do thou"
5931,SECTION LXXI.,"hear, what I say. In the house of a certain Brahman there lives a beggar"
5932,SECTION LXXI.,"by the name of _Sarvarthasiddha_ (_i.e._, who has got all his desires"
5933,SECTION LXXI.,"satisfied). And although I am innocent, he has for nothing hurt me."""
5934,SECTION LXXI.,Hearing those words Rāma sent his messenger who brought
5935,SECTION LXXI.,"_Sarvarthasiddha_, master of all subjects. Thereupon beholding Rāma in"
5936,SECTION LXXI.,"the assembly that effulgent and leading twice-born one said:—""O"
5937,SECTION LXXI.,"blameless Rāma, tell me what I shall do for thee."" Whereto Rāma said—""O"
5938,SECTION LXXI.,"twice-born one, thou hast hurt this dog. What offence did it commit by"
5939,SECTION LXXI.,thee that thou didst strike it severely with a rod. Anger is an enemy
5940,SECTION LXXI.,which taketh away life. Anger is a sweet-speeched enemy in the garb of a
5941,SECTION LXXI.,friend. It is the foremost of passions and like unto a sharp dagger. And
5942,SECTION LXXI.,it is anger that stealeth away every thing. It pilfers all that is
5943,SECTION LXXI.,"acquired by asceticism, sacrifices and gifts. It is proper therefore by"
5944,SECTION LXXI.,every means to kill anger. Passions are running amock on all sides like
5945,SECTION LXXI.,so many exceedingly wicked steeds. Being satiated with of all objects of
5946,SECTION LXXI.,"enjoyments it is better to govern them by patience. By mind, actions,"
5947,SECTION LXXI.,words and eyes a man should engage in the well being of people. He
5948,SECTION LXXI.,"should not injure any body and be not addicted to any thing. The harm,"
5949,SECTION LXXI.,"that a mind not under control, can accomplish, is beyond the range of a"
5950,SECTION LXXI.,"sharp dagger, trodden serpent and of an enemy always enraged. Even the"
5951,SECTION LXXI.,"nature of one, who has learnt humility, cannot be trusted. He, who hides"
5952,SECTION LXXI.,"his nature, himself reveals his true self."" Rāma, of unwearied actions,"
5953,SECTION LXXI.,"having said this, _Sarvarthasiddha_, the foremost of twice-born ones,"
5954,SECTION LXXI.,"said:—""Knocking about the whole day for alms I was highly enraged and"
5955,SECTION LXXI.,struck this dog. It was sitting in the mid-way and I asked it again and
5956,SECTION LXXI.,"again to move away. Thereupon, moving away and standing with reluctance,"
5957,SECTION LXXI.,"it stood fearfully on the road-side. O descendant of Raghu, I was at"
5958,SECTION LXXI.,"that time stricken with hunger, and struck it for its vicious conduct. O"
5959,SECTION LXXI.,"king of kings, I am guilty in this, and thou must punish me. O lord of"
5960,SECTION LXXI.,"kings, do thou administer punishment unto me,—I shall then be released"
5961,SECTION LXXI.,"from the fear of hell."" Thereupon, Rāma asked all the ministers,"
5962,SECTION LXXI.,"saying:—""What is to be done now? What punishment is to be inflicted on"
5963,SECTION LXXI.,"him? We can protect subjects, if we can administer punishment"
5964,SECTION LXXI.,"proportionate to crime."" Thereat, Vrigu, Angiras, Kutsa, Vasishtha,"
5965,SECTION LXXI.,"Kashya and other ascetics, the leading preachers, the ministers, the"
5966,SECTION LXXI.,"citizens, and other sages conversant with Sastras, present there,"
5967,SECTION LXXI.,"said:—""A Brāhmana should not be punished with death."" The sages"
5968,SECTION LXXI.,"conversant with laws having said this, the ascetics addressed Rāma,"
5969,SECTION LXXI.,"saying:—""O Rāghava, a king is the governor of all—specially thyself."
5970,SECTION LXXI.,"Thou art the chastiser of the three worlds, the eternal Vishnu."" They"
5971,SECTION LXXI.,"all having said this, the dog began:—""Thou didst solemnly say ’What"
5972,SECTION LXXI.,"shall I do for thee?’ Therefore, if thou art gratified with me, and if"
5973,SECTION LXXI.,"thou dost wish to confer boons on me, do thou appoint this Brāhmana as"
5974,SECTION LXXI.,"the head of family."" Thereupon, having been thus honored and pleased and"
5975,SECTION LXXI.,"ascending an elephant, he proceeded to occupy his new dignified station."
5976,SECTION LXXI.,"At this, the councillors of Rāma, surprised, said:—""O thou of great"
5977,SECTION LXXI.,"effulgence, he has not been punished. Rather thou hast conferred on him"
5978,SECTION LXXI.,"a boon."" Hearing the words of ministers, Rāma said:—""You do not know the"
5979,SECTION LXXI.,"real truth of the whole thing—the dog knows it well."" Being accosted by"
5980,SECTION LXXI.,"Rāma, the dog said:—""O Rāghava, I was the head of the family of"
5981,SECTION LXXI.,Kālanjava. After the worship of the deities and Brāhmana and the
5982,SECTION LXXI.,"feasting of the servants, male, and female, I used to take my food. I"
5983,SECTION LXXI.,"used to parcel out things duly, and my mind was not in the least"
5984,SECTION LXXI.,attached to sin. I used to preserve with great care the articles
5985,SECTION LXXI.,"belonging to the tutelary deities, was humble, good-natured and engaged"
5986,SECTION LXXI.,in the well-being of all animals. Still I have fallen into this dreadful
5987,SECTION LXXI.,"and wretched condition. O Rāghava, this Brāhmana is angry by nature, and"
5988,SECTION LXXI.,"impious, injures others, and is impatient, cruel, harsh in words and"
5989,SECTION LXXI.,"ignorant, and therefore shall degrade his seven generations up and down."
5990,SECTION LXXI.,He will by no means be able to discharge the duties of a head of a
5991,SECTION LXXI.,"family. He, whom thou wishest to take to hell with her son, beasts and"
5992,SECTION LXXI.,"friends, should be engaged in the serving the Brāhmans and kine. For all"
5993,SECTION LXXI.,"his good actions, he is slain who steals the wealth of a Brāhmana, a"
5994,SECTION LXXI.,"deity, a woman, and a boy, and the riches given away by him. O Rāghava,"
5995,SECTION LXXI.,one who pilfers the riches of a Brāhmana or a deity falls into a hell
5996,SECTION LXXI.,"called Vichi. Even he who thinks in his mind of stealing it, goes once"
5997,SECTION LXXI.,"and again into hell."" Hearing the words of the dog, the eyes of the"
5998,SECTION LXXI.,effulgent Rāma were expanded with surprise. The dog went back from where
5999,SECTION LXXI.,it had come. In its pristine birth the dog was high-minded—it is now
6000,SECTION LXXI.,"cursed for being born in a degraded state of existence. Thereupon,"
6001,SECTION LXXI.,repairing at last to Vārānasi the dog took the vow of fasting.

6008,SECTION LXXII.,There lived for a long time a vulture and an owl on a mountain extending

6010,SECTION LXXII.,"with lions, tigers and various birds, situated in a pleasant forest"
6011,SECTION LXXII.,abounding in trees near the city of Ayodhyā. Once on a time the vicious
6012,SECTION LXXII.,"vulture alleging that the nest of the owl was his own, began to quarrel"
6013,SECTION LXXII.,"with him. O worshipful Sir, thereupon they both said:—""The lotus-eyed"
6014,SECTION LXXII.,Rāma is the king of all people; let us go to him and he will decide to
6015,SECTION LXXII.,"whom the nest belongs."" Having thus settled the vulture and the owl,"
6016,SECTION LXXII.,"being impatient with rage, quarrelling with one another, appeared before"
6017,SECTION LXXII.,"Rāma and touched his feet. Beholding that lord of men, the vulture said:"
6018,SECTION LXXII.,"""O preserver of humanity, thou art the foremost of celestials and"
6019,SECTION LXXII.,"Asuras. O thou of great effulgence, thou art gifted with intelligence"
6020,SECTION LXXII.,and learning more than Vrihaspati and Sukrachārya. Thou art cognisant of
6021,SECTION LXXII.,the good and bad conditions of creatures. In beauty thou art like the
6022,SECTION LXXII.,Moon and art irrepressible like the Sun. In glory thou art like
6023,SECTION LXXII.,"Himalaya, in gravity like the Ocean, in prowess like the Patriarch, in"
6024,SECTION LXXII.,"patience like the Earth, and in velocity like the Wind. O Rāghava, thou"
6025,SECTION LXXII.,"art the preceptor of the mobile and immobile creation, gifted with all"
6026,SECTION LXXII.,"sorts of wealth, illustrious, devoid of a revengeful spirit,"
6027,SECTION LXXII.,"unconquerable, victorious, and master of all Sastras and laws. O"
6028,SECTION LXXII.,"foremost of men, hear. I have an application to thee. O Rāghava, I had"
6029,SECTION LXXII.,built a nest for myself; this owl is now occupying it as his own;
6030,SECTION LXXII.,"therefore, O king, do thou save me."" The vulture having said this, the"
6031,SECTION LXXII.,"owl began:—""True, it is, O king, that in him are the portions of the"
6032,SECTION LXXII.,"Moon, Indra, the Sun, Kuvera and Yama, but there is in him also a"
6033,SECTION LXXII.,"portion of man. But thou art thyself the omnipresent deity, Nārāyana."
6034,SECTION LXXII.,"Thou, impelled by thine own self, dost judge all creatures impartially;"
6035,SECTION LXXII.,"therefore, a portion of gentleness is well manifest in thee and"
6036,SECTION LXXII.,"therefore do people call thee, a portion of the Moon. O patriarch, in"
6037,SECTION LXXII.,"anger, punishment, gift and fear, thou art our giver, destroyer and"
6038,SECTION LXXII.,"protector,—it is for this that thou art called Indra. In energy thou art"
6039,SECTION LXXII.,"like fire irrepressible unto all creatures, and because thou dost spread"
6040,SECTION LXXII.,"thy lusture upon all creatures, that thou art called the Sun. Thou art"
6041,SECTION LXXII.,the very lord of riches or art even superior to Kuvera; like Padmā unto
6042,SECTION LXXII.,"the lord of riches, Sri is always by thee. Because thou dost discharge"
6043,SECTION LXXII.,"the functions of Kuvera, thou art the giver of wealth unto us. O"
6044,SECTION LXXII.,"Rāghava, thou lookest upon all creatures, mobile and immobile, with an"
6045,SECTION LXXII.,"impartial eye—thou dost regard thy friends and foes with impartiality,"
6046,SECTION LXXII.,"and thou art duly protecting thy subjects. O Rāghava, death pursues him"
6047,SECTION LXXII.,with whom thou art offended—and it is for this reason that thou art
6048,SECTION LXXII.,"styled by people ’the highly powerful Yama.’ O foremost of kings,"
6049,SECTION LXXII.,because thou art forgiving unto all creatures and a kind king that
6050,SECTION LXXII.,people sing thy glories as of a man on earth. The king is the strength
6051,SECTION LXXII.,of the weak and helpless and he is the eye of the blind and the refuge
6052,SECTION LXXII.,of those who have no shelter. Thou art also our king; therefore do thou
6053,SECTION LXXII.,"listen to our petition. O king, entering into my nest, this vulture is"
6054,SECTION LXXII.,"oppressing me. Thou only, O foremost of men, art the divine chastiser of"
6055,SECTION LXXII.,"mankind."" Hearing those words, Rāma sent for his councillors. The"
6056,SECTION LXXII.,"ministers of Daçaratha and Rāma, Vrishthi, Yayanta, Vijaya, Siddhārtha,"
6057,SECTION LXXII.,"Rāshtravarddhana, Asoka, Darmapāla the highly powerful Sumantra and"
6058,SECTION LXXII.,"others were well versed in laws, high-minded, conversant with all the"
6059,SECTION LXXII.,"Sastras, intelligent, born in respectable families, and adepts in"
6060,SECTION LXXII.,"counsel. Having invited them all and ascending his Pushpaka car, he went"
6061,SECTION LXXII.,"to the place in question, and, descending there, asked the vulture, ""How"
6062,SECTION LXXII.,"long has this nest been made? Tell me, if thou remember it."" Whereto the"
6063,SECTION LXXII.,"vulture replied:—""From the time mankind were first born and spread over"
6064,SECTION LXXII.,"the four quarters of the globe have I been living in this nest."" The owl"
6065,SECTION LXXII.,"said:—""At the time when the earth was (first) adorned with trees that"
6066,SECTION LXXII.,"this nest of mine was constructed."" Hearing these words, Rāma said to"
6067,SECTION LXXII.,"the councillors:—""That assembly is not an assembly where there are no"
6068,SECTION LXXII.,friends—nor are they old men who do not dwell upon religious topics.
6069,SECTION LXXII.,That religion is not a religion where there is no truth and that truth
6070,SECTION LXXII.,is not the truth where there is hypocrisy. Those councillors are liars
6071,SECTION LXXII.,who do not give proper replies in time on the subjects they are
6072,SECTION LXXII.,well-informed on. He who does give reply to a question under the
6073,SECTION LXXII.,"influence of passion, anger or fear, binds himself with a thousand"
6074,SECTION LXXII.,"nooses of Varuna, and at the expiration of full one year he is released"
6075,SECTION LXXII.,"from a single sin."" Hearing these words, the ministers said to Rāma:—""O"
6076,SECTION LXXII.,"thou having a large mind, what the owl has said is true—the vulture has"
6077,SECTION LXXII.,"not spoken the truth. Thou art the evidence this, O great king—for the"
6078,SECTION LXXII.,king is the last refuge of all—the root of the subject and the eternal
6079,SECTION LXXII.,"religion. He who is punished by the king, is not doomed to a degraded"
6080,SECTION LXXII.,"state. He is, in truth, saved from the fear of hell and reaches a better"
6081,SECTION LXXII.,"state."" Hearing the words of the ministers, Rāma said:—""Hear what is"
6082,SECTION LXXII.,"mentioned in the Puranas. Formerly the Sun, the Moon, the welkin with"
6083,SECTION LXXII.,"the stars, the earth with the mountains and forests—the three worlds,"
6084,SECTION LXXII.,"the mobile and the immobile, were under water. At that time only"
6085,SECTION LXXII.,Nārāyana existed as the second Sumeru. In Nārāyana’s belly was stationed
6086,SECTION LXXII.,"the earth with Lakshmi. Having destroyed the creation and entered water,"
6087,SECTION LXXII.,"the highly effulgent Vishnu, identical with the souls of creatures, lay"
6088,SECTION LXXII.,asleep there for many long years. Beholding Vishnu asleep after the
6089,SECTION LXXII.,"destruction of the universe and knowing Vishnu of obstructed breath, the"
6090,SECTION LXXII.,"great ascetic Brahmā entered his abdomen. Thereupon, when a golden lotus"
6091,SECTION LXXII.,"sprang from Vishnu’s navel. That great lord, ascetic Brahmā, originated"
6092,SECTION LXXII.,therefrom and was engaged in austere penances for the purpose of
6093,SECTION LXXII.,"creating earth, air, mountains, trees, men, reptiles and all animals"
6094,SECTION LXXII.,born from womb or egg. At that time from the ears of Nārāyana originated
6095,SECTION LXXII.,two valiant and dreadful demons under the name of Madhu and Kaitabha.
6096,SECTION LXXII.,"Beholding the Patriarch, there they were greatly enraged, and pursued"
6097,SECTION LXXII.,"him. Thereat, the self-born cried aloud hideously. Awakened by that"
6098,SECTION LXXII.,"sound, Nārāyana engaged in fighting with Madhu and Kaitabha, and slew"
6099,SECTION LXXII.,them with his discus. And with their gore the whole earth was deluged.
6100,SECTION LXXII.,"Thereupon, purifying the earth again, Hari, preserver of the world,"
6101,SECTION LXXII.,covered it with trees. And various drugs were also created. And the
6102,SECTION LXXII.,earth was called _Medini_ because it was filled with _Medas_ marrow of
6103,SECTION LXXII.,"Madhu and Kaitabha. It is for this that I hold, O ministers, that this"
6104,SECTION LXXII.,"house does not belong to the vulture, but to the owl. Therefore, this"
6105,SECTION LXXII.,"vicious vulture should be punished—for this wicked, vicious-minded one,"
6106,SECTION LXXII.,"robbing another’s nest, is oppressing him."" In the interval a voice was"
6107,SECTION LXXII.,"heard in the sky stating the true facts:—""O Rāma, do not slay the"
6108,SECTION LXXII.,"vulture,—for it has already been reduced to ashes by the force of"
6109,SECTION LXXII.,"Gautama’s asceticism. O lord of men, this vulture, in its pristine"
6110,SECTION LXXII.,"birth, was a heroic truthful and pure king by the name of Brahmadatta."
6111,SECTION LXXII.,"Once on a time a Brāhamana, by the name of Gautama, the very"
6112,SECTION LXXII.,"personification of Kāla, came to the house of Brahmadatta for food and"
6113,SECTION LXXII.,"said:—’O king, I shall feed in thy house for more than a hundred years.’"
6114,SECTION LXXII.,"Thereupon, offering that effulgent Brāhmana, with his own hands, water"
6115,SECTION LXXII.,"to wash his feet the king Brahmadatta, made arrangements for his meal."
6116,SECTION LXXII.,Accidentally flesh was mixed with the food of the high-souled Gautama.
6117,SECTION LXXII.,"Being enraged thereat, the ascetic imprecated him with a dreadful curse"
6118,SECTION LXXII.,"and said:—’O king, thou become a vulture.’ The king said:—’Be"
6119,SECTION LXXII.,"propitiated, O thou of great vows; do not imprecate me thus. I have, out"
6120,SECTION LXXII.,"of ignorance committed this offence. O great one, O blameless one, do"
6121,SECTION LXXII.,thou act so that this curse may find termination.’ Thereat understanding
6122,SECTION LXXII.,"that this offence was committed by the king unwittingly, the ascetic"
6123,SECTION LXXII.,"said—’O king, in the race of Ikshwākus a king shall be born under the"
6124,SECTION LXXII.,"name of Rāma. O foremost of men, thou shalt be released from the curse"
6125,SECTION LXXII.,"when he shall touch thee.’"" Hearing the voice in the sky, Rāma touched"
6126,SECTION LXXII.,Brahmadatta. Thereupon renouncing his vulture from and assuming a
6127,SECTION LXXII.,"beautiful body smeared with celestial perfumes, he praised Rāma and"
6128,SECTION LXXII.,"said:—""O thou conversant with piety, by thy Favour have I been saved"
6129,SECTION LXXII.,"from the dreadful hell—here hath ended my curse."""

6138,SECTION LXXIII.,"one bright morning, after having performed his first diurnal rites,"
6139,SECTION LXXIII.,"Kākutstha, understanding the ways of the citizens, became anxious to"
6140,SECTION LXXIII.,present himself at a spot whence he could observe the citizens. At this
6141,SECTION LXXIII.,"time Sumantra, entering, addressed him, saying,—""O king, stopped at the"
6142,SECTION LXXIII.,"gate, some ascetics stay there,—_Maharshis_, led by Bhārgava and"
6143,SECTION LXXIII.,"Chyavana. And, O mighty monarch, eager for a sight of thee, those"
6144,SECTION LXXIII.,"dwellers on the banks of the Yamunā, well pleased, have despatched me"
6145,SECTION LXXIII.,"(hither), O tiger among men."" Hearing his words, the righteous Rāma"
6146,SECTION LXXIII.,"answered: ""Let the exalted Dwijas enter."" Thereat, honoring the royal"
6147,SECTION LXXIII.,"mandate, the warder with joined hands brought those ascetics difficult"
6148,SECTION LXXIII.,"of being approached. And numbering over an hundred, flaming up in their"
6149,SECTION LXXIII.,"native effulgence, those high-souled anchorets entered the royal"
6150,SECTION LXXIII.,residence. And they presented Rāma with various fruits in profusion and
6151,SECTION LXXIII.,"vessels filled with sanctified waters of all holy spots. Thereupon,"
6152,SECTION LXXIII.,accepting the waters of the holy places as well as the various kinds of
6153,SECTION LXXIII.,"fruit, that mighty-armed one spake to the mighty ascetics: ""Do ye"
6154,SECTION LXXIII.,"agreeably to desert take these seats."" Hearing Rāma’s speech, all the"
6155,SECTION LXXIII.,Maharshis sat down on those graceful and elegant golden seats. And
6156,SECTION LXXIII.,"seeing the saints seated there, that captor of hostile capitals,"
6157,SECTION LXXIII.,"Rāghava, restraining himself, with joined hands, observed: ""What is the"
6158,SECTION LXXIII.,reason of your visit? What shall I needfully perform for you? I am
6159,SECTION LXXIII.,worthy of being commanded by the Maharshis; and I must without demur

6181,SECTION LXXXV.,"remarked: ""O lord of men, do thou hear of the origin of the fear that"
6182,SECTION LXXXV.,"threatens our country. O king, formerly in the Krita age, there was a"
6183,SECTION LXXXV.,"magnanimous offspring of Diti, the mighty Asura, Madu, eldest son of"
6184,SECTION LXXXV.,"Lotā. He was well disposed towards Brāhmanas, kind to those seeking his"
6185,SECTION LXXXV.,"refuge, and gifted with high intelligence. The exceedingly generous"
6186,SECTION LXXXV.,"deities delighted in him greatly. And by way of honoring him, Rudra"
6187,SECTION LXXXV.,conferred a wonderful boon upon Madhu endowed with prowess and ever
6188,SECTION LXXXV.,"intent on religion. And extracting a dart from his own, possessed of"
6189,SECTION LXXXV.,"terrific energy, endowed with great force, and furnished with exceeding"
6190,SECTION LXXXV.,"splendour, that high-souled one, well pleased, made it over (to Madhu)"
6191,SECTION LXXXV.,and spoke to him. Thou hast practised excellent and unrivalled
6192,SECTION LXXXV.,"righteousness, which hath won my good graces, and (therefore), I, highly"
6193,SECTION LXXXV.,"gratified, bestow on thee this choice weapon. So long as thou, O mighty"
6194,SECTION LXXXV.,"Asura, dost not assail celestials and Vipras, so long shall this be"
6195,SECTION LXXXV.,"thine,—otherwise it shall come to naught. Reducing to cinders the person"
6196,SECTION LXXXV.,"that shall rashly enter upon conflict with thee, this dart shall return"
6197,SECTION LXXXV.,"to thy hand."" Having thus obtained the boon from Rudra, the mighty"
6198,SECTION LXXXV.,"Asura, again bowing to Mahādeva, addressed him, saying: ""O reverend one,"
6199,SECTION LXXXV.,"may this excellent dart be the possession of my family. O god, thou art"
6200,SECTION LXXXV.,"the lord of the immortals.’ Thereat the lord of all beings, the mighty"
6201,SECTION LXXXV.,"deity Siva, answered Madhu, when he had spoken thus: ’This will not be."
6202,SECTION LXXXV.,"But in order that thy prayer may not go for nothing, I graciously say in"
6203,SECTION LXXXV.,thy behalf that one of thy sons shall sway this dart. So long that
6204,SECTION LXXXV.,dart-handed one shall be incapable of being destroyed by any creature.’
6205,SECTION LXXXV.,"Having obtained this wonderful boon from the god, Madhu—foremost of"
6206,SECTION LXXXV.,Asuras—caused a splendid city to be constructed. His beloved wife the
6207,SECTION LXXXV.,exalted and majestic Kumbhinasi is the offspring of Viçwavasu by Analā.
6208,SECTION LXXXV.,"Her son, the highly powerful wicked, and fierce Lavana, ever since his"
6209,SECTION LXXXV.,"boyhood, gave himself up to a sinful course of life. Seeing his son,"

6211,SECTION LXXXV.,"not say anything to him. And forsaking this world, he entered the region"
6212,SECTION LXXXV.,"of Varuna; and making over the dart unto Lavana, communicated to him all"
6213,SECTION LXXXV.,"about the boon he had obtained. And by virtue of the power of the dart,"
6214,SECTION LXXXV.,he oppresseth the three worlds in especial the ascetics; such is the
6215,SECTION LXXXV.,"power of Lavana, and such is his dart. Hearing all this O Kākutstha,"

6404,SECTION LXXVIII.,"replied ""Satrughna, hear I shall tell thee, whose sacrificial ground was"
6405,SECTION LXXVIII.,this in the days of yore. There was a king by the name of Saudāsa—one of
6406,SECTION LXXVIII.,thy ancestors. His son Virjashaha was a highly powerful and pious king.
6407,SECTION LXXVIII.,The heroic Saudāsa was fond of hunting from his boyhood. Once on a time
6408,SECTION LXXVIII.,"while a-hunting, he espied two Rakshasas in the forest. He had heard"
6409,SECTION LXXVIII.,about them many times before; they were in the shape of tigers and of a
6410,SECTION LXXVIII.,dreadful figure and were not satiated with devouring many thousand deer.
6411,SECTION LXXVIII.,King Saudāsa saw those two Rākshasas and found the forest divested of
6412,SECTION LXXVIII.,all creatures. And enraged in consequence thereof he slew one of them.
6413,SECTION LXXVIII.,"Having slain him and been at ease, Saudāsa, the foremost of men, began"
6414,SECTION LXXVIII.,"to eye that Rākshasa. His mate, greatly aggrieved, said to him:—’O"
6415,SECTION LXXVIII.,"vicious one, thou hast, without any fault, slain my companion—I shall"
6416,SECTION LXXVIII.,therefore mete out becoming punishment unto thee.’ Having said this the
6417,SECTION LXXVIII.,Rākshasa vanished therefrom. Thereupon in time the prince Virjashaha
6418,SECTION LXXVIII.,became king. Saudāsa engaged in celebrating a mighty horse-sacrifice in
6419,SECTION LXXVIII.,the vicinity of this hermitage. Vasishtha officiated as a priest at that
6420,SECTION LXXVIII.,sacrifice. It continued for many Ayuta years. For immense riches the
6421,SECTION LXXVIII.,sacrifice appeared like one performed by the celestials. Thereupon when
6422,SECTION LXXVIII.,"the sacrifice was about to be finished the aforesaid Rākshasa,"
6423,SECTION LXXVIII.,"remembering his former enmity, assumed the shape of Vasishtha and said"
6424,SECTION LXXVIII.,"to the king Saudāsa:—’O king, to-day the sacrifice shall end; do"
6425,SECTION LXXVIII.,"therefore, without any delay, feed me with meat.’ Hearing the words of"
6426,SECTION LXXVIII.,"the Rākshasa in the guise of a Brahman, the king ordered his expert"
6427,SECTION LXXVIII.,"cooks, saying:—’Do ye soon prepare such dishes of meat as may satisfy my"
6428,SECTION LXXVIII.,preceptor Vasishtha.’ Having been ordered by the king the cooks
6429,SECTION LXXVIII.,reverentially went away and the Rākshasa assuming their shape brought
6430,SECTION LXXVIII.,before the king dishes. The king and queen offered those dishes unto the
6431,SECTION LXXVIII.,"ascetic Vasishtha, who, after being treated to them, perceived that they"
6432,SECTION LXXVIII.,"were of human flesh and, terribly enraged, said:—’O king, let this be"
6433,SECTION LXXVIII.,thy food which thou hast offered me; this shall not prove otherwise.’
6434,SECTION LXXVIII.,Being enraged on hearing it the king Saudāsa took water in his palms and
6435,SECTION LXXVIII.,"was about to imprecate Vasishtha, when his queen, preventing him"
6436,SECTION LXXVIII.,"said:—’O king, the illustrious great ascetic Vasishtha is our preceptor"
6437,SECTION LXXVIII.,and priest and so thou shouldst not imprecate him.’ Hearing those words
6438,SECTION LXXVIII.,"of his queen, the king Saudāsa, threw off that powerful water on his own"
6439,SECTION LXXVIII.,feet which at once became dark. From that time the illustrious king
6440,SECTION LXXVIII.,Saudāsa became also known by the name of Kalasmpāda. Thereupon the king
6441,SECTION LXXVIII.,with his spouse again and again bowed unto Vasishtha’s feet and informed
6442,SECTION LXXVIII.,him of what the Rākshasa had done under the guise of a Brāhmana. Hearing
6443,SECTION LXXVIII.,the words of the king and being apprised that this vile act had been
6444,SECTION LXXVIII.,"done by the Rākshasa, Vasishtha said, ’O king, even what I have said"
6445,SECTION LXXVIII.,angrily shall not prove futile. However I confer upon thee this boon
6446,SECTION LXXVIII.,"that after twelve years thou shalt be freed from this curse, and by my"
6447,SECTION LXXVIII.,favour thou shalt cherish no recollection of thy condition extending
6448,SECTION LXXVIII.,over those twelve years.’ Having thus suffered the consequences of the

6450,SECTION LXXVIII.,"governed his subjects. O descendant of Rāghu, the sacrificial ground of"

6466,SECTION LXXIX.,"to great delight on beholding those two highly effulgent sons,"
6467,SECTION LXXIX.,resembling the newly risen sun and the celestials. Thereupon he made
6468,SECTION LXXIX.,arrangements against the oppression of ghosts and goblins. Thereupon
6469,SECTION LXXIX.,taking Kusa (the upper part of the grass) and Lava (the lower part) the
6470,SECTION LXXIX.,great ascetic Vālmiki made those arrangements. And giving Kusa
6471,SECTION LXXIX.,"sanctified by Mantras unto the hands of elderly women he said, ""Do ye"
6472,SECTION LXXIX.,"rub the person of the elder boy with these,"" and giving them Lava he"
6473,SECTION LXXIX.,"said ""Do ye rub the person of the younger brother with this. And"
6474,SECTION LXXIX.,according to this I shall name the first Son Kusa and the second Lava;
6475,SECTION LXXIX.,"and by those names they shall be celebrated on earth."" Thereupon"
6476,SECTION LXXIX.,"reverentially taking from the hands of Vālmiki and Kusa Lava, the means"
6477,SECTION LXXIX.,"of protection, the elderly ladies engaged in guarding them. Hearing that"
6478,SECTION LXXIX.,Sitā without any trouble had given birth to two sons and elderly female
6479,SECTION LXXIX.,ascetics had been engaged in protecting them and hearing the chanting of
6480,SECTION LXXIX.,"Rāma’s glories in the midnight, Satrughna thought within himself."
6481,SECTION LXXIX.,"""Blessed it is that Sitā hath given birth to two sons."" And with this"
6482,SECTION LXXIX.,joy the live long night of Srābana passed away in no time. Having
6483,SECTION LXXIX.,performed the morning rites after the expiration of the night and taken
6484,SECTION LXXIX.,"farewell from the ascetic Vālmiki, Lakshmana proceeded towards the west."
6485,SECTION LXXIX.,And having spent seven nights he at last arrived at the hermitage of the
6486,SECTION LXXIX.,pious Rishis living on the banks of the Yamunā. Taking shelter there he
6487,SECTION LXXIX.,engaged in pleasant conversation with Chābanya and other ascetics.
6488,SECTION LXXIX.,Having remained there for the night and talked with those ascetics the
6489,SECTION LXXIX.,"high-souled, heroic Raghu prince Satrughna was greatly delighted."

6497,SECTION LXXX.,"saying, ""O Brahman, how powerful is Lavana? And what is the strength of"
6498,SECTION LXXX.,his dart? What persons before had been destroyed by this dart in
6499,SECTION LXXX.,"conflict?"" Hearing the words of the high-souled descendant of"
6500,SECTION LXXX.,"Raghu,—Satrughna, the highly effulgent Chābanya replied saying.—""O"
6501,SECTION LXXX.,"descendant of Raghu, Lavana hath accomplished many works by this dart;"
6502,SECTION LXXX.,"amongst them, hear what Māndhāta, born in the race of Ikshwāku, did. The"
6503,SECTION LXXX.,early king of Ayodhyā was known over the three worlds under the name of
6504,SECTION LXXX.,"Māndhāta. He was the son of Yavanāshwa, highly powerful and strong."
6505,SECTION LXXX.,Having brought the whole world under his subjection the king Māndhāta
6506,SECTION LXXX.,engaged in the conquest of the celestial region. He having been engaged
6507,SECTION LXXX.,in making preparations to conquer the world of gods—the celestial chief
6508,SECTION LXXX.,"Indra with other immortals was greatly terrified. With this promise, the"
6509,SECTION LXXX.,king Māndhāta went up into the celestial region that he would occupy the
6510,SECTION LXXX.,half of Indra’s throne and kingdom and the celestials would adore him.
6511,SECTION LXXX.,"Being apprised of this vicious intention of his, Indra, the slayer of"
6512,SECTION LXXX.,"Paka, consoled him in sweet words, saying;—’O foremost of men, even in"
6513,SECTION LXXX.,"the land of men, thou hast not been able to become the real king."
6514,SECTION LXXX.,Without perfectly subjugating the earth how dost thou wish to lord over
6515,SECTION LXXX.,"the celestial kingdom? If the whole world is under thy subjection, O"
6516,SECTION LXXX.,"hero, be thou, with the whole host of thy servants and soldiers,"
6517,SECTION LXXX.,"installed on the celestial throne.’ Indra having said this, the"
6518,SECTION LXXX.,"high-souled Māndhāta replied:—’O Sakra, who on this earth, hath"
6519,SECTION LXXX.,"disobeyed my commands?’ Whereto Indra replied ’O sinless one, the"
6520,SECTION LXXX.,"night-ranger, Lavana, Madhu’s son, living in Madhuvana, is not under thy"
6521,SECTION LXXX.,"control.’ Hearing those dreadful and unpleasant words from Indra, the"
6522,SECTION LXXX.,"king lowered his head in shame and became silent. Thereupon, having"
6523,SECTION LXXX.,"welcomed Indra in that way, he left there and returned to earth. O"
6524,SECTION LXXX.,"slayer of enemies, with an angry heart, army and conveyance he went to"
6525,SECTION LXXX.,subjugate Madhu’s son Lavana and sent an emissary inviting him to
6526,SECTION LXXX.,"battle. The ambassador, having gone there, addressed many unpleasant"
6527,SECTION LXXX.,words unto Lavana and the night-ranger devoured him. On the other hand
6528,SECTION LXXX.,"finding the delay of his return the king Māndhāta, enraged, began to"
6529,SECTION LXXX.,assail the Rākshasa Lavana with arrows from all sides. Laughing wildly
6530,SECTION LXXX.,Lavana took up the dart in his hand and discharged it to destroy the
6531,SECTION LXXX.,king with his followers. Thereupon growing powerful the dart reduced the
6532,SECTION LXXX.,king with his servants and army into ashes and returned to Lavana. In
6533,SECTION LXXX.,"this wise the high-souled king Māndhāta, with his huge army, was slain."
6534,SECTION LXXX.,"O gentle hero, incomparable and great is the strength of the dart."
6535,SECTION LXXX.,Forsooth thou shalt slay Lavana next morning. Certain is thy victory if
6536,SECTION LXXX.,Lavana cannot take up his dart. People shall be at ease if thou canst
6537,SECTION LXXX.,"bring about the destruction of Lavana. O foremost of men, I shall then"
6538,SECTION LXXX.,describe unto thee the incomparable and dreadful prowess of the
6539,SECTION LXXX.,"vicious-souled Lavana and his dart. O king, with great exertions did"
6540,SECTION LXXX.,"Lavana slay Māndhāta and not easily. O high-minded one, next morning"
6541,SECTION LXXX.,thou shalt surely destroy Lavana. He shall issue out for flesh without
6542,SECTION LXXX.,"taking his dart. And at that time, O lord of men, thou shalt, for sooth,"

6552,SECTION LXXXI.,"morning having arrived, the heroic Lavana issued out of his city to"
6553,SECTION LXXXI.,"collect food. In the meantime having crossed the river Yamunā, the"
6554,SECTION LXXXI.,"heroic Satrughna, with bow in his hands, stood at the gate of Madhu’s"
6555,SECTION LXXXI.,"city. Thereupon returning in the noon with many thousand animals, the"
6556,SECTION LXXXI.,"night-ranger Lavana, of dreadful actions, espied Satrughna standing at"
6557,SECTION LXXXI.,"the gate with a weapon in his hand. Thereupon he said:—""What shall thou"
6558,SECTION LXXXI.,"do with this weapon? O vile wight, enraged I have devoured many thousand"
6559,SECTION LXXXI.,persons holding weapons like thee. I now perceive thou hast also been
6560,SECTION LXXXI.,"possessed by Kāla. O vile man, I am fully fed. How shall thou, of thy"
6561,SECTION LXXXI.,"own accord, enter into my mouth?"" Lavana having said this again and"
6562,SECTION LXXXI.,again laughing the great hero Satrughna shed tears in anger. The
6563,SECTION LXXXI.,"high-minded Satrughna being beside himself with rage, from all his"
6564,SECTION LXXXI.,person issued burning lustre. Greatly enraged he said to the
6565,SECTION LXXXI.,"night-ranger ""O thou of a vicious intellect, I wish to enter into a duel"
6566,SECTION LXXXI.,"encounter with thee. I am the son of the great king Daçaratha, brother"
6567,SECTION LXXXI.,of the intelligent Rāma and my name is Satrughna. I slay all my enemies
6568,SECTION LXXXI.,and have come here to destroy thee. I wish now to fight with thee—do
6569,SECTION LXXXI.,thou enter into a duel conflict. Thou art the enemy of all animals. Thou
6570,SECTION LXXXI.,"shall not be able to survive at my hands."" He having said this, the"
6571,SECTION LXXXI.,"Rākshasa, laughing aloud, replied unto that foremost of men;—""Thy"
6572,SECTION LXXXI.,understanding is bewildered. By the influence of destiny thou hast come
6573,SECTION LXXXI.,"under my control. The Rākshasa Rāvana was the brother of my aunts, o"
6574,SECTION LXXXI.,"thou of vicious understanding, O vile wight, it is for his wife that"
6575,SECTION LXXXI.,Rāma did slay him. It is out of hatred that I have tolerated the
6576,SECTION LXXXI.,destruction of Rāvana’s family and have pardoned you all. You are all
6577,SECTION LXXXI.,vile men; I have slain and defeated all of your family that have passed
6578,SECTION LXXXI.,away and shall destroy all that are living and shall come into
6579,SECTION LXXXI.,"existence. O thou of vicious intellect, if thou wishest I shall fight"
6580,SECTION LXXXI.,with thee. Do thou wait here so long I do not bring my weapon. Do thou
6581,SECTION LXXXI.,"remain here as long as I with that shall not kill thee."" Whereto"
6582,SECTION LXXXI.,"Satrughna immediately replied ""Where shalt thou go while I am alive? The"
6583,SECTION LXXXI.,practical men should never let off the enemies who come out of their own
6584,SECTION LXXXI.,"accord. He, who inviteth an enemy into battle under the influence of"
6585,SECTION LXXXI.,perverted understanding is slain like a coward. Do thou behold this
6586,SECTION LXXXI.,world of creatures to thy hearts’ content for I shall by various sharp

6597,SECTION LXXXII.,"and grinding his teeth he invited that foremost of Raghus, Satrughna, to"
6598,SECTION LXXXII.,"fight. And Satrughna, the slayer of celestial’s enemies, said to the"
6599,SECTION LXXXII.,"dreadful Lavana, giving vent to those words:—""Satrughna was not born"
6600,SECTION LXXXII.,when thou didst defeat other kings; do thou therefore proceed to Death’s
6601,SECTION LXXXII.,"abode being assailed by shafts. O thou of a vicious soul, as did the"
6602,SECTION LXXXII.,celestials behold Rāvana slain so shall the Rishis and learned Brahmans
6603,SECTION LXXXII.,"behold thee, destroyed by me. O Rākshasa, forsooth shall good crown"
6604,SECTION LXXXII.,cities and villages when thou shalt fall down burnt by my arrows. As the
6605,SECTION LXXXII.,"rays of the sun enter into lotus so shall arrows, hard as lightning,"
6606,SECTION LXXXII.,"discharged by my hands, shall enter into thy heart."" Being beside"
6607,SECTION LXXXII.,"himself with ire on hearing those words of Satrughna, Lavana threw a"
6608,SECTION LXXXII.,huge tree against his breast. And Satrughna too sundered it into a
6609,SECTION LXXXII.,hundred pieces. Beholding his own action baffled the Rākshasa again took
6610,SECTION LXXXII.,"up many trees and hurled them at Satrughna, who, with three or four"
6611,SECTION LXXXII.,"hundred bent arrows, cut them all, one by one, into pieces. Thereupon"
6612,SECTION LXXXII.,when the powerful Satrughna assailed him with arrows the Rākshasa was
6613,SECTION LXXXII.,not the least pained. Rather laughing aloud the valiant Rākshasa
6614,SECTION LXXXII.,uprooted a tree and struck him with that on the head. With that stroke
6615,SECTION LXXXII.,he was wounded and slain. And that hero falling there arose a terrible
6616,SECTION LXXXII.,"uproar amongst the Rishis, celestials, Gandharvas and Apsarās. Thereupon"
6617,SECTION LXXXII.,considering Satrughna slain the night-ranger did not enter his house
6618,SECTION LXXXII.,albeit he got the opportunity; and moreover beholding him fallen and
6619,SECTION LXXXII.,destroyed he did not take up his dart. He then began to carry his
6620,SECTION LXXXII.,"collected food. Regaining his sense within a moment, Satrughna, with a"
6621,SECTION LXXXII.,"weapon in his hand, stood at the city gate and the Rishis began to"
6622,SECTION LXXXII.,"praise him. Thereupon, he having taken up an excellent arrow of"
6623,SECTION LXXXII.,unfailing aim the ten quarters were filled with its native brilliance.
6624,SECTION LXXXII.,Its face was like lightning and its velocity the same and it looked like
6625,SECTION LXXXII.,Meru and Mandara; its joints were all bent. None could defeat it in
6626,SECTION LXXXII.,battle. It was pasted with red sandal resembling blood and its feathers
6627,SECTION LXXXII.,"were beautiful. Beholding that dart like unto the fire of dissolution,"
6628,SECTION LXXXII.,"and dreadful like unto the lords of Dānavas, mountains and Asuras, the"
6629,SECTION LXXXII.,"creatures were greatly terrified. What more, being disturbed, the"
6630,SECTION LXXXII.,"celestials, Asuras, Gandharvas, saints and Apsarās and all other"
6631,SECTION LXXXII.,"creatures of the world approached the Great Patriarch, the conferrer of"
6632,SECTION LXXXII.,"boons and said;—""The fear of the celestials and the destruction of the"
6633,SECTION LXXXII.,"creatures hath arrived."" Hearing those words the Patriarch Brahma"
6634,SECTION LXXXII.,"replied ""Although it is a source of great fear still it is not dreadful"
6635,SECTION LXXXII.,"unto the celestials."" Thereupon with sweet accents he said:—""Hear, O ye"
6636,SECTION LXXXII.,"celestials, Satrughna hath taken up this arrow for the destruction of"
6637,SECTION LXXXII.,Lavana. By the energy thereof we have all been overwhelmed. This
6638,SECTION LXXXII.,"effulgent, ever-existing arrow was made by the Primeval Deity Vishnu—the"
6639,SECTION LXXXII.,"lord of creatures. My children, the burning arrow, of which you are"
6640,SECTION LXXXII.,"afraid, was made by the high-minded Vishnu for slaying the demons Madhu"
6641,SECTION LXXXII.,and Kaitabha. And Vishnu alone is cognizant of its energy. This
6642,SECTION LXXXII.,Satrughna is the first portion of Vishnu’s person; do ye all go hence

6646,SECTION LXXXII.,"battle-field of Satrughna and Lavana and saw that the arrow, held by"
6647,SECTION LXXXII.,"Satrughna’s hands, was burning like the fire of dissolution. Beholding"
6648,SECTION LXXXII.,"the welkin covered by the celestials, Satrughna, the descendant of"
6649,SECTION LXXXII.,"Raghu, emitting leonine roars, again and again looked towards Lavana."
6650,SECTION LXXXII.,And being again excited by the high-souled Satrughna and enraged Lavana
6651,SECTION LXXXII.,"arrived for encounter. Thereupon expanding his bow up to ears,"
6652,SECTION LXXXII.,"Satrughna, the most accomplished archer, discharged his arrow against"
6653,SECTION LXXXII.,the spacious breast of Lavana. And piercing his heart that arrow entered
6654,SECTION LXXXII.,"speedily into Rasātala And having entered Rasātala that arrow, honored"
6655,SECTION LXXXII.,"by the celestials, again came to the descendant of Raghu. And being"
6656,SECTION LXXXII.,pierced by that shaft the night-ranger Lavana fell down on earth like a

6722,SECTION LXXXIV.,great ascetic Vālmiki addressed to the high-souled Satrughna many sweet

6727,SECTION LXXXIV.,"easily slain that vicious-souled Rākshasa, Lavana. By thy prowess the"

6729,SECTION LXXXIV.,slain Rāvana—but without any trouble whatsoever thou hast accomplished
6730,SECTION LXXXIV.,"this mighty work. Lavana being slain, the celestials have been greatly"
6731,SECTION LXXXIV.,delighted—what more the well-being of the whole universe and all
6732,SECTION LXXXIV.,"creatures has been brought about. O Rāghava, O foremost of men, being"
6733,SECTION LXXXIV.,present in the assemblage of Vasava—I duly witnessed your combat. O
6734,SECTION LXXXIV.,"Satrughna, I too have been greatly delighted—I therefore smell thy crown"
6735,SECTION LXXXIV.,"for this is the best expression of love."" Saying this the high-minded"
6736,SECTION LXXXIV.,Vālmiki smelled his crown and made arrangements for his reception as
6737,SECTION LXXXIV.,"well as that of his followers. After meals, Satrughna, the foremost of"
6738,SECTION LXXXIV.,"men, listened to themes relating to Rāma and set in musical notes. Those"
6739,SECTION LXXXIV.,themes were composed describing the early actions of Rāma. They were
6740,SECTION LXXXIV.,"composed in Sanskrit, set to the tune of a musical instrument, adorned"
6741,SECTION LXXXIV.,with all the marks of vocal music and arranged in accompaniment with
6742,SECTION LXXXIV.,"notes. Satrughna, the foremost of men, heard them from the beginning to"

6744,SECTION LXXXIV.,it he was beside himself with joy and his eyes were full of tears. And
6745,SECTION LXXXIV.,remaining stunned for some time and regaining his sense afterwards he
6746,SECTION LXXXIV.,"began to breathe hard out of excess of surprise. He heard, in that song,"
6747,SECTION LXXXIV.,"of past events as things passing on. And hearing it, his followers, with"
6748,SECTION LXXXIV.,"their heads down and sorrowfully said:—""Wonder,"" and saying this they"
6749,SECTION LXXXIV.,"began to converse with one another:—""Alas! Where are we? Is this a"

6752,SECTION LXXXIV.,"Being in this wise greatly surprised they said to Satrughna:—""O foremost"

6755,SECTION LXXXIV.,"said:—""It is not proper for us, O Ye soldiers, to question him in this"

6757,SECTION LXXXIV.,"not therefore becoming to ask him about this out of curiosity."" Having"

6773,SECTION LXXXV.,of the Raghu race. And my desire is that thou mayst with other
6774,SECTION LXXXV.,"illustrious Rishis, grant me permission on this."" Satrughna, the slayer"
6775,SECTION LXXXV.,"of enemies, having said this, the great ascetic Vālmiki embraced and"
6776,SECTION LXXXV.,bade him farewell. He was greatly anxious to behold Rāma and saluting
6777,SECTION LXXXV.,the foremost of Munis he speedily proceeded to Ayodhyā. Thereupon having
6778,SECTION LXXXV.,"entered the highly picturesque city Ayodhyā, the graceful descendant of"
6779,SECTION LXXXV.,"Ikshwākus, Satrughna reached where the long-armed and the highly"
6780,SECTION LXXXV.,effulgent Rāma was waiting. He espied there Rāma in the midst of the
6781,SECTION LXXXV.,councillors like Indra amongst the immortals burning in his own
6782,SECTION LXXXV.,"effulgence. And having bowed with folded hands unto Rāma, having truth"
6783,SECTION LXXXV.,"for his prowess, Satrughna said:—""O great king, I have carried out all"
6784,SECTION LXXXV.,thine behests; I have slain the vicious Lavana and filled his city with
6785,SECTION LXXXV.,"subjects. O descendant of Raghu, twelve years have passed away without"
6786,SECTION LXXXV.,thee—I do not wish to live any longer separated from thee. Do thou
6787,SECTION LXXXV.,"therefore, O Kākuthstha of unmitigated prowess, have compassion on me."
6788,SECTION LXXXV.,"Without thee, I cannot live for ever in a foreign province like a"
6789,SECTION LXXXV.,"motherless child."" He having said this, Rāma embraced him and said:—""Be"
6790,SECTION LXXXV.,"not sorry, O hero. This is not a becoming action for Kshatriyas. The"
6791,SECTION LXXXV.,"kings, O Rāghava, are never tired of living in a foreign land. According"
6792,SECTION LXXXV.,"to the morality of the Kshatriyas, their greatest duty consists in"
6793,SECTION LXXXV.,"governing the subjects. O heroic and foremost of men, do thou, at"
6794,SECTION LXXXV.,"intervals, come to Ayodhyā to see me and return to thy own city."
6795,SECTION LXXXV.,Forsooth thou art dearer than my life. But it is an incumbent duty to
6796,SECTION LXXXV.,"govern the kingdom. Do thou therefore, O Kākutstha, live with me for"
6797,SECTION LXXXV.,"seven nights, and afterwards return to thy city with thy servants, army"
6798,SECTION LXXXV.,"and conveyances."" Hearing those moral and charming words of Rāma,"
6799,SECTION LXXXV.,"Satrughna poorly replied, saying:—""Thy command shall be carried out."""
6800,SECTION LXXXV.,"Thereupon Satrughna, well-skilled in the use of bows, remained with Rāma"
6801,SECTION LXXXV.,for seven nights and then addressed himself for departure. Thereupon
6802,SECTION LXXXV.,"having invited Bharata and Lakshmana, the high-souled Rāma, having truth"
6803,SECTION LXXXV.,"for his prowess, speedily went for his city in a huge chariot. The"
6804,SECTION LXXXV.,high-souled Lakshmana and Bharata followed him on foot for some
6805,SECTION LXXXV.,distance.

6813,SECTION LXXXVI.,greatly delighted by governing his subjects piously in the company of
6814,SECTION LXXXVI.,"Bharata and Lakshmana. Some days having passed in this wise—a villager,"
6815,SECTION LXXXVI.,"an old Brahman, arrived at the palace gate with a dead body. That"
6816,SECTION LXXXVI.,"Brahman, stricken with affection, again and again bewailed in various"
6817,SECTION LXXXVI.,"piteous accents, exclaiming ""What heinous crime had I committed in my"
6818,SECTION LXXXVI.,pristine birth that I have been constrained to witness the death of my
6819,SECTION LXXXVI.,"son. My son, thou hast not as yet completed fourteen years. To my misery"
6820,SECTION LXXXVI.,"thou hast met with untimely death. Forsooth, for thy grief, O my son,"
6821,SECTION LXXXVI.,myself and thy mother shall soon be snatched away by death. I do not
6822,SECTION LXXXVI.,"remember to have ever uttered a falsehood, or injured an animal or"
6823,SECTION LXXXVI.,"perpetrated any other crime. Therefore for some other sinful action,"
6824,SECTION LXXXVI.,"this boy, without performing the son’s duties towards his parents, has"
6825,SECTION LXXXVI.,"gone to the abode of death. Save under the regime of Rāma, I have never"
6826,SECTION LXXXVI.,seen or heard of the dreadful death of such a boy who hath not attained
6827,SECTION LXXXVI.,"the age. Forsooth, Rāma hath perpetrated a mighty iniquity for which"
6828,SECTION LXXXVI.,"boys, during his administration, have been meeting with untimely death."
6829,SECTION LXXXVI.,In other governments boys have no fear of such an untimely death.
6830,SECTION LXXXVI.,"Therefore, O king confer life upon this dead child. Or else with my"
6831,SECTION LXXXVI.,spouse I shall renounce my life at this gate like one having no lord. O
6832,SECTION LXXXVI.,"Rāma, soiled by the sin consequent upon the destruction of a Brāhmana,"
6833,SECTION LXXXVI.,"do thou live long happily with brothers. O thou of great prowess, up to"
6834,SECTION LXXXVI.,"this time we have lived happily in thy kingdom. And now, O Rāma, under"
6835,SECTION LXXXVI.,thy subjection we are being troubled with the sorrow of our son’s death.
6836,SECTION LXXXVI.,We have been brought under the influence of Kāla; so in thy kingdom
6837,SECTION LXXXVI.,there is not the least happiness for us. Having attained Rāma as its
6838,SECTION LXXXVI.,"lord, the kingdom, of the high-souled Ikshwākus, hath attained to the"
6839,SECTION LXXXVI.,"condition of one having no master, where during Rāma’s regime the death"
6840,SECTION LXXXVI.,of a boy hath been brought about. For being impiously governed by a
6841,SECTION LXXXVI.,"king, for his sin, the subjects meet with calamities. And a king"
6842,SECTION LXXXVI.,following evil tracks and not governing the subjects righteously people
6843,SECTION LXXXVI.,"meet with untimely death. Therefore, when a king doth not suppress the"
6844,SECTION LXXXVI.,"crimes committed by people either in cities or provinces the fear, of"
6845,SECTION LXXXVI.,"untimely death, comes in. Evident it is therefore that undoubtedly the"
6846,SECTION LXXXVI.,sin of the king hath appeared in cities and provinces. And for that
6847,SECTION LXXXVI.,"reason this boy hath met with death."" Being overwhelmed with sorrow that"
6848,SECTION LXXXVI.,old Brahman again and again remonstrated with the king in these piteous
6849,SECTION LXXXVI.,words and afterwards covered the death body (of his son).

6856,SECTION LXXXVII.,"Hearing those sorrowful words of the Brahman, Rāma was greatly sorry and"
6857,SECTION LXXXVII.,"sent for Vasishtha, Bāmadeva, his brothers, citizens and councillors."
6858,SECTION LXXXVII.,"Thereupon having entered the apartment in the company of Vasishtha,"
6859,SECTION LXXXVII.,"eight Brahmans blessed the king Rāma, resembling a celestial, saying"
6860,SECTION LXXXVII.,"""May victory crown thee."" Mārkandeya, Maudgalya, Bāmadeva, Kashyapa,"
6861,SECTION LXXXVII.,"Kātyāyana, Javali, Gautama, and Narada—these eight leading Brāhmanas"
6862,SECTION LXXXVII.,"having taken their seats, Rāma, with folded hands, saluted them. And he"
6863,SECTION LXXXVII.,"showed due civilities towards his minister, citizens, Rishis and all"
6864,SECTION LXXXVII.,others. Thereupon all the highly effulgent Rishis being accomodated with
6865,SECTION LXXXVII.,seats Rāma narrated duly before them the account of the Brāhmana and
6866,SECTION LXXXVII.,"said. ""This Brahman is waiting at the Palace-gate."" Hearing those words"
6867,SECTION LXXXVII.,"of the poorly king, Nārada, in the presence of all other Rishis,"
6868,SECTION LXXXVII.,"replied:—""Hear, king, why this boy hath met with untimely death. And"
6869,SECTION LXXXVII.,"hearing this, O descendant of Raghu, do thou settle what thou thinkest"
6870,SECTION LXXXVII.,"proper. O king, in the golden age, only the Brahmans used to engage in"
6871,SECTION LXXXVII.,"asceticism. At that age, save the Brāhmanas no other caste used to lead"
6872,SECTION LXXXVII.,"the life of an anchoret. And for this, the Brahmans were the highest"
6873,SECTION LXXXVII.,"caste, effulgent in asceticism, shorn of ignorance, above death and"
6874,SECTION LXXXVII.,"conversant with three ages. Thereupon at the end of the golden age,"
6875,SECTION LXXXVII.,Brāhmana’s understanding became loose and the Tretā Yuga set in. At this
6876,SECTION LXXXVII.,"age Kshatryas, gifted with the power acquired by pristine asceticism,"
6877,SECTION LXXXVII.,"were born. And those men, intent upon austere penances, that were born"
6878,SECTION LXXXVII.,"in the Tretā age, were more powerful and greater devotees than those in"
6879,SECTION LXXXVII.,the former age. In the golden age the Brāhmanas were more powerful than
6880,SECTION LXXXVII.,the Kshatryas. But in the Tretā age the Brāhmanas and the Kshatryas were
6881,SECTION LXXXVII.,"equally powerful. Thus in the Tretā age, not beholding prominence of the"
6882,SECTION LXXXVII.,"Brāhmanas greater than that of the Kshatryas, Manu and other religious"
6883,SECTION LXXXVII.,leaders of the time composed the Sastra describing and setting in the
6884,SECTION LXXXVII.,four divisions of castes. In this wise the Tretā age was prolific with
6885,SECTION LXXXVII.,"virtues of the four Varnas, and many pious sacrifices and was shorn of"
6886,SECTION LXXXVII.,"iniquities. But being attacked a little with iniquity, one portion of"
6887,SECTION LXXXVII.,sin appeared on earth. And growing impious people lost their strength.
6888,SECTION LXXXVII.,"And for houses and farms that were the property of the former age,"
6889,SECTION LXXXVII.,"people of the Tretā Yuga were possessed by envy, the outcome of the"
6890,SECTION LXXXVII.,quality of darkness. And with the fading of impiety on earth during
6891,SECTION LXXXVII.,"Tretā, the soiled sin of untruth appeared. And this iniquity stretching"
6892,SECTION LXXXVII.,"one footstep, the lease of people’s lives, for sins, became limited. And"
6893,SECTION LXXXVII.,"the sin of untruth descending on earth, people, to avoid the extinction"
6894,SECTION LXXXVII.,"of life in consequence thereof, became truthful and engaged in many"
6895,SECTION LXXXVII.,pious observances. During the Tretā age the Brāhmanas and Kshatryas
6896,SECTION LXXXVII.,engaged in austere penances and the Vaisyas and Sudras engaged in
6897,SECTION LXXXVII.,serving them. And the greatest piety of the Vaisyas and Sudras at that
6898,SECTION LXXXVII.,time consisted of serving the Brāhmanas and Kshatryas and specially for
6899,SECTION LXXXVII.,the Sudras the highest religion was to serve people of all Varnas. O
6900,SECTION LXXXVII.,"foremost of kings, at the end of the Tretā age, Vaisyas and Sudras being"
6901,SECTION LXXXVII.,"fully overpowered by the sin of untruth, the Brāhmanas and the Kshatryas"
6902,SECTION LXXXVII.,also grew feeble. And the second foot of impiety being ushered into the
6903,SECTION LXXXVII.,"world the Dwāpara age set in. O foremost of men, during this age two"
6904,SECTION LXXXVII.,"legs of piety being cut off, impiety and untruth multiplied. And in Yuga"
6905,SECTION LXXXVII.,named Dwāpara the Vaisyas engaged in devout penances. In this wise in
6906,SECTION LXXXVII.,three ages the three Varnas gradually engaged in ascetic performances.
6907,SECTION LXXXVII.,The piety of asceticism by Yugas gradually became established in three
6908,SECTION LXXXVII.,"Varnas. But, O foremost of men, in these three Yugas the Sudras were not"
6909,SECTION LXXXVII.,"entitled to the virtues of devout penances. O foremost of men, the"
6910,SECTION LXXXVII.,"degraded caste—the Sudras, during thy regime, have engaged in austere"
6911,SECTION LXXXVII.,penances. And in the Kali Yuga asceticism shall be established in the
6912,SECTION LXXXVII.,"Sudras. O king, even in the Dwāpara, devout penances for Sudras were"
6913,SECTION LXXXVII.,"considered as impiety, what to speak of the Tretā age. O king, one"
6914,SECTION LXXXVII.,"Sudra, under the influence of vicious understanding has begun devout"
6915,SECTION LXXXVII.,penances within thy kingdom. And for that reason this boy hath met with
6916,SECTION LXXXVII.,death. Calamity sets in that kingdom where a vicious-minded person
6917,SECTION LXXXVII.,commits an iniquity and that vicious wight and the king forsooth
6918,SECTION LXXXVII.,"speedily repair to hell. The king, who piously governeth his subjects,"
6919,SECTION LXXXVII.,"receiveth the sixth portion of their study, asceticism and good actions."
6920,SECTION LXXXVII.,While the king is entitled to the sixth portion of everything why should
6921,SECTION LXXXVII.,"he not fully protect his subjects? Therefore, O chief of men, do thou"
6922,SECTION LXXXVII.,bring all informations of thy kingdom. And be then studious to repress
6923,SECTION LXXXVII.,"vices wherever thou shalt find them. And by that, O foremost of men, the"
6924,SECTION LXXXVII.,"piety of the subjects shall be increased, the lease of their life shall"
6925,SECTION LXXXVII.,"be prolonged and this boy shall regain his life."""

6932,SECTION LXXXVIII.,Hearing the sweet words of the celestial saint Nārada Rāma was greatly

6934,SECTION LXXXVIII.,that foremost of twice-born ones and place the dead body of the boy in a
6935,SECTION LXXXVIII.,jar full of oil. Let this body be protected by sweet-scented oil so that
6936,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"it might not be soiled by any means. See that it is not disfigured, its"
6937,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"joints are not loosened and the hairs do not fall off."" The highly"
6938,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"illustrious Rāma, the descendant of Ikshwākus, thus commanded Lakshmana,"
6939,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"gifted with auspicious marks, and thought of his car and desired it to"
6940,SECTION LXXXVIII.,come soon. Understanding his intention the golden car appeared before
6941,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"him in no time and saluting him said:—""O thou of long arms, thine"
6942,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"chariot hath come."" Hearing the sweet words of Pushpaka the king Rāma"
6943,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"saluted the great ascetics, ascended the car with his burning bow,"
6944,SECTION LXXXVIII.,quiver and dagger and left Bharata and Lakshmana in charge of the city.
6945,SECTION LXXXVIII.,And searching that Sudra devotee here and there Rāghava proceeded
6946,SECTION LXXXVIII.,towards the west. And not beholding him there he went to the North
6947,SECTION LXXXVIII.,bounded by the Himalayas. And even there he did not espy the Sudra
6948,SECTION LXXXVIII.,ascetic and even the smallest iniquity was not seen there. Thereupon
6949,SECTION LXXXVIII.,returning from that quarter the king journeyed the whole of east. And
6950,SECTION LXXXVIII.,having sat on the Pushpaka car he saw that the eastern quarter was
6951,SECTION LXXXVIII.,transparent like a looking glass and there was not the best touch of
6952,SECTION LXXXVIII.,sin. From the east Rāghava proceeded towards the south and espied a big
6953,SECTION LXXXVIII.,tank by the side of the Saivala mountain. On the banks of that pond one
6954,SECTION LXXXVIII.,ascetic was performing the most austere penances with his legs upwards
6955,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"and head downwards. Thereupon approaching him, Rāma said—""O thou of good"
6956,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"vows, blessed art thou; I do ask thee, now, O thou highly effulgent and"
6957,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"grown old old in asceticism, in what Varna thou art born. I put this"
6958,SECTION LXXXVIII.,question out of curiosity. I am the son of king Daçaratha and my name is
6959,SECTION LXXXVIII.,Rāma. For what art thou going through such hard austerities? Is it
6960,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"heaven or anything else that thou prayest for? O ascetic, I wish to hear"
6961,SECTION LXXXVIII.,of the purpose for which thou art performing such hard penances. Art
6962,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"thou a Brahman, or an irrepresible Kshatriya or the third caste Vaisya"
6963,SECTION LXXXVIII.,or a Sudra? Do thou speak the truth and thou shaft be crowned with
6964,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"auspiciousness."" Hearing the words of Rāma, the ascetic, whose face was"
6965,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"downwards, gave out his degraded birth and communicated unto him for"
6966,SECTION LXXXVIII.,what he was performing ascetic observances.
6967,SECTION LXXXVIII.,

6969,SECTION LXXXVIII.,
6970,SECTION LXXXV.,SECTION LXXXV.
6971,SECTION LXXXV.,
6972,SECTION LXXXV.,
6973,SECTION LXXXV.,"Hearing the words of Rāma of unwearied actions, the ascetic, with his"
6974,SECTION LXXXV.,"face downwards, said:—""O highly illustrious Rāma, I am born in the race"
6975,SECTION LXXXV.,of Sudras; and with a view to reach the region of the celestials with my
6976,SECTION LXXXV.,"body I am going through these austere penances. O Kākuthstha, I shall"
6977,SECTION LXXXV.,never utter a falsehood since I am willing to conquer the the region of
6978,SECTION LXXXV.,"gods. I am a Sudra and my name is Sambuka."" The Sudra ascetic having"
6979,SECTION LXXXV.,"said this, Rāma took out of scabbard a beautiful sharp sword and chopped"
6980,SECTION LXXXV.,"off his head therewith. And that Sudra being slain, Indra, Agni and"
6981,SECTION LXXXV.,other celestials praised him again and again and showered flowers. And
6982,SECTION LXXXV.,"being greatly delighted, the celestials said to Rāma, having truth for"
6983,SECTION LXXXV.,"his prowess:—""O thou of a great mind, thou hast nicely performed this"
6984,SECTION LXXXV.,"god-like work. O slayer of foes, do thou now crave a boon. O descendant"
6985,SECTION LXXXV.,"of Raghu, being slain by thee this Sudra hath been able to attain to the"
6986,SECTION LXXXV.,"abode of the celestials."" Hearing the words of the deities, Rāma, having"
6987,SECTION LXXXV.,"truth for his prowess, said with folded hands to Purandara, of a"
6988,SECTION LXXXV.,"thousand eyes:—""If the celestials are pleased, I beg for this boon that"
6989,SECTION LXXXV.,the son of the twice-born one may be restored to life. Do ye confer upon
6990,SECTION LXXXV.,me this boon; this is my wished-for object. It is for my iniquitous
6991,SECTION LXXXV.,conduct that this only son of the Brahman hath met with untimely death.
6992,SECTION LXXXV.,Do ye restore him to life. I have promised before that leading
6993,SECTION LXXXV.,"twice-born one that I would restore his son to life—do ye therefore,"
6994,SECTION LXXXV.,"make not me a liar."" Hearing the words of Rāma the leading celestials"
6995,SECTION LXXXV.,"delightedly said:—""Do thou return, O Kākutstha. The Brahmin boy shall"
6996,SECTION LXXXV.,"immediately gain back his life and be united with his father, mother and"
6997,SECTION LXXXV.,"friends. O Rāghava, with the death of the Sudra the boy has regained his"
6998,SECTION LXXXV.,"life. Be thou at ease; may good betide thee. O foremost of men, we, too,"
6999,SECTION LXXXV.,"return with delighted hearts. O Rāghava, we desire to behold the"
7000,SECTION LXXXV.,"hermitage of the great saint Agastya. Having been initiated, that highly"
7001,SECTION LXXXV.,effulgent Brahman saint hath lived within waters for twelve years; his
7002,SECTION LXXXV.,"vow hath now terminated. O Kākuthstha, we shall now go to welcome that"
7003,SECTION LXXXV.,"Muni. Do thou also follow us to see that saint."" Saying ""So be it!"" to"
7004,SECTION LXXXV.,the words of the celestials that descendant of Raghu ascended his golden
7005,SECTION LXXXV.,car Pushpaka. And having ascended spacious cars the celestials proceeded
7006,SECTION LXXXV.,to the hermitage of Agastya born of a _Kumbha_. Rāma too also followed
7007,SECTION LXXXV.,them. Thereupon beholding the celestials present the virtuous-souled
7008,SECTION LXXXV.,"Agastya, the jewel of asceticism, welcomed them particularly. Having"
7009,SECTION LXXXV.,"accepted his worship and adored in return that great Muni, the"
7010,SECTION LXXXV.,"immortals, delighted, proceeded to their abodes with their followers."
7011,SECTION LXXXV.,The celestials having departed Rāma descended from Pushpaka and saluted
7012,SECTION LXXXV.,that effulgent and foremost of Rishis Agastya. And having received due
7013,SECTION LXXXV.,hospitality he sat there. Thereupon the highly effulgent and leading
7014,SECTION LXXXV.,"ascetic Kumbhajoni said:—""O Rāghava, I have been greatly delighted with"
7015,SECTION LXXXV.,"thy coming. By my good fortune I have seen thee to-day. O Rāma, I love"
7016,SECTION LXXXV.,"thee because thou art gifted with many qualities. O king, thou art my"
7017,SECTION LXXXV.,worshipful guest. I was thinking of thee. The celestials informed me
7018,SECTION LXXXV.,that thou wert coming having slain the Sudra ascetic. Thou hast observed
7019,SECTION LXXXV.,piety and hast given back life unto the dead child of the Brahman. Do
7020,SECTION LXXXV.,"thou spend this night with me, O Rāghava. Thou art the graceful"
7021,SECTION LXXXV.,Nārāyana. In thee the whole universe is established. Thou art the lord
7022,SECTION LXXXV.,of all creatures and the eternal Purusha. Thou shalt go to thy city next
7023,SECTION LXXXV.,"morning in thy Pushpaka car. This ornament, O gentle one, hath been made"
7024,SECTION LXXXV.,by the architect of the celestials; its make is very beautiful and it is
7025,SECTION LXXXV.,"dazzling by its own lustre. By accepting this, O Kākutstha, do thou"
7026,SECTION LXXXV.,satisfy my desire. It is said that one attains to best fruits if he
7027,SECTION LXXXV.,"makes present unto his deity, of best articles he gets from another."
7028,SECTION LXXXV.,Thou art the only worthy person to use this ornament. Thou art alone
7029,SECTION LXXXV.,capable of conferring best fruits. Thou dost protect Indra and other
7030,SECTION LXXXV.,"celestials. Therefore I do duly present thee with this ornament. O king,"
7031,SECTION LXXXV.,"do thou accept it."" Thereupon meditating upon the duties of the"
7032,SECTION LXXXV.,"Kshatryas, the heroic Rāma, the foremost of the intelligent, said:—""O"
7033,SECTION LXXXV.,"illustrious Sir, the Brāhmanas only can accept presents—how can the"
7034,SECTION LXXXV.,Kshatryas do? To take gifts is the function of the Brāhmanas—for
7035,SECTION LXXXV.,"Kshatryas it is a source of censure. Besides, to receive presents from a"
7036,SECTION LXXXV.,"Brāhmana, is highly culpable. Do thou therefore tell me, how I may"
7037,SECTION LXXXV.,"accept this ornament."" Hearing the words of Rāma, the great saint"
7038,SECTION LXXXV.,"Agastya replied saying:—""O Rāma, O son of Daçaratha, at the beginning of"
7039,SECTION LXXXV.,"the golden age, people had no king; but Vāsava was the ruler of the"
7040,SECTION LXXXV.,"celestials. Therefore to obtain a king, men approached Brahmā, the god"
7041,SECTION LXXXV.,of gods and said ’O deity thou hast placed Indra as ruler over the
7042,SECTION LXXXV.,"celestials; therefore, O lord of creatures, do thou also confer upon us"
7043,SECTION LXXXV.,a king who shall be foremost among men; by worshipping him we shall be
7044,SECTION LXXXV.,freed from all sins. We shall not live without the king—even this is our
7045,SECTION LXXXV.,firm resolution.’ Thereupon the Patriarch Brahmā sent for Indra and
7046,SECTION LXXXV.,other deities and said:—’Do ye all give a portion of your respective
7047,SECTION LXXXV.,energies.’ Thereupon the deities gave each a portion of their own
7048,SECTION LXXXV.,energies. Thereupon Brahma made a _Khshupa_ or sound and therefrom
7049,SECTION LXXXV.,originated a king under the name of _Khshupa_. And in his person Brahmā
7050,SECTION LXXXV.,placed in equal proportions the energies of the deities. Thereafter he
7051,SECTION LXXXV.,made _Khshupa_ the foremost king of men. By virtue of the portion of
7052,SECTION LXXXV.,Indra’s energy the king _Khshupa_ brought the earth under his control;
7053,SECTION LXXXV.,by that of Varuna’s energy he fostered his own body; by Kuvera’s portion
7054,SECTION LXXXV.,he conferred riches upon his subjects; and by that of Yama he governed
7055,SECTION LXXXV.,"them. Therefore, O Rāma, by virtue of Indra’s portion, do thou accept"
7056,SECTION LXXXV.,"this ornament and confer upon me the salvation."" Hearing the words of"
7057,SECTION LXXXV.,"the Muni, Rāma took from him that brilliant celestial ornament burning"
7058,SECTION LXXXV.,"like the rays of the Sun. And having taken that excellent ornament,"
7059,SECTION LXXXV.,"Dāçarathi asked the great saint Kumbhayoni, saying:—""Whence hast thou"
7060,SECTION LXXXV.,obtained this celestial ornament of a wondrous make? Who hast given thee
7061,SECTION LXXXV.,"this? Brahman, I do accost thee thus out of curiosity. Thou art the mine"
7062,SECTION LXXXV.,"of many wonders."" Whereto Agastya replied, saying ""Hearken, O Rāma, how"

7072,SECTION XC.,austere penances. Once on a time I began to roam all over the forest
7073,SECTION XC.,being willing to see well every nook and corner of it. And I saw that it
7074,SECTION XC.,was impossible to ascertain how very pleasant that forest was. In every
7075,SECTION XC.,place there were trees with profuse sweet fruits and roots. In the
7076,SECTION XC.,middle I espied a pond extending over a Yojana. There was no moss in
7077,SECTION XC.,"that deep, calm, clear and sweet water; there were lotuses and lilies"
7078,SECTION XC.,"and swans, Kārandāvas, Chakravakas and many other water fowls were"
7079,SECTION XC.,"playing in the waters. O lord of creatures, at no distance from that"
7080,SECTION XC.,"pond I saw an old, holy hermitage but there was no creature or animal"
7081,SECTION XC.,around it. It was summer and I spent that night in that hermitage. Next
7082,SECTION XC.,morning leaving my bed I arrived at the banks of the pond and saw a
7083,SECTION XC.,plump dead body in the waters. None of its limbs was pale and its beauty
7084,SECTION XC.,was not spoiled. Beholding it and standing on the banks I began to
7085,SECTION XC.,meditate upon it. And thought I ’What is this?’ In a moment I espied a
7086,SECTION XC.,"beautiful car, swift-coursing like the mind and drawn by ganders. And I"
7087,SECTION XC.,saw in that chariot a celestial person. He was being attended by
7088,SECTION XC.,Apasaras adorned with celestial ornaments and having lotus-eyes. Some of
7089,SECTION XC.,"them were singing, some dancing and some playing on Mridanga, Vina and"
7090,SECTION XC.,other musical instruments and some were fanning his lotus-like
7091,SECTION XC.,"countenance with valuable, golden chowries, dazzling like the rays of"
7092,SECTION XC.,"the moon. O Rāma, the foremost of Raghu’s race, like unto the moon"
7093,SECTION XC.,renouncing the summit of the Sumeru mount that celestial wight got down
7094,SECTION XC.,from his seat in the car and engaged in devouring the dead body. And
7095,SECTION XC.,having taken enough flesh he got down into waters and duly performed
7096,SECTION XC.,ablution. And thereafter that heavenly being again addressed himself for
7097,SECTION XC.,"ascending the car. O foremost of men, beholding that heavenly being"
7098,SECTION XC.,"about to get up I accosted him, saying ‘Who art thou? I see, thou hast a"
7099,SECTION XC.,"celestial form, then why hast thou taken such an abominable food? O thou"
7100,SECTION XC.,"adored of the immortals, persons like thee should not take such meals. O"
7101,SECTION XC.,"gentle one, I have been striken with great curiosity and wish to hear"
7102,SECTION XC.,all. Thine living upon dead body doth not appear agreeable unto me.’ O
7103,SECTION XC.,"king, plainly and out of curiosity I put to him these questions. And"
7104,SECTION XC.,"hearing them, the celestial being related everything unto me."""

7112,SECTION CXI.,"being, with folded hands, said ’Hear, O Brahman, from what unavoidable"
7113,SECTION CXI.,cause hath proceeded this happy and again painful incident. There
7114,SECTION CXI.,flourished in the days of yore a highly illustrious and powerful
7115,SECTION CXI.,Vidarbha king under the name of Sudeva known over three worlds. He was
7116,SECTION CXI.,my father. His two queens gave birth to two sons. My name is Sweta and
7117,SECTION CXI.,the name of my youngest brother was Suratha. After the decease of my
7118,SECTION CXI.,sire the subjects installed me on the throne and I governed them piously
7119,SECTION CXI.,and carefully for a thousand years. By some reason I was informed of the
7120,SECTION CXI.,extent of my life. And when I perceived that the lease of my life had
7121,SECTION CXI.,well-nigh expired I entered into the life of Banaprasta. And having
7122,SECTION CXI.,placed my brother Suratha on the throne I entered into a dense forest
7123,SECTION CXI.,devoid of men and animals at no distance from this pond to perform
7124,SECTION CXI.,devout penances. And I performed austerities for a long time near this
7125,SECTION CXI.,"pond. Having performed hard penances in this forest, for three thousand"
7126,SECTION CXI.,years I at last attained to the region of Brahmā. And albeit I had
7127,SECTION CXI.,reached the Brahmā region I was still being assailed by hunger and
7128,SECTION CXI.,thirst. And gradually I grew tired therewith. Thereupon approaching the
7129,SECTION CXI.,"patriarch Brahmā, the lord of three worlds, I said:—""O Brahmā, here"
7130,SECTION CXI.,there is no hunger or thirst; still why have I been brought to their
7131,SECTION CXI.,"control? Of what iniquity of mine is this fruit? O deity, tell me upon"
7132,SECTION CXI.,"what I shall live?"" Whereto the patriarch replied;—""O son of Sudeva, do"
7133,SECTION CXI.,"thou live upon sweet savoured meat everyday? O Sweta, thou didst only"
7134,SECTION CXI.,look to the growth of thy person when thou didst perform rigid penances.
7135,SECTION CXI.,"O thou of a great mind, nothing grows, when nothing is sown. Thou didst"
7136,SECTION CXI.,"only perform ascetic penances, but thou didst not make any gift of"
7137,SECTION CXI.,"charity. It is for that reason, O my son, that thou art, even in heaven,"
7138,SECTION CXI.,being assailed by hunger and thirst. Thereupon do thou now live upon
7139,SECTION CXI.,thine own dead body fostered by various food. By this thou shalt keep up
7140,SECTION CXI.,"thy being. O Sweta, thou shalt be relieved from this affliction when the"
7141,SECTION CXI.,"irrepressible, great Saint Agastya shall reach that forest. O gentle"
7142,SECTION CXI.,"one, even unto the immortals he can give salvation; what wonder it is"
7143,SECTION CXI.,"that he shall relieve thee from the miseries of hunger and thirst."" O"
7144,SECTION CXI.,"foremost of twice-born ones, from the time of hearing those words of the"
7145,SECTION CXI.,"great Brahmā, the god of gods, I have been engaged in this cursed work"
7146,SECTION CXI.,"of feeding upon my own dead body. O Brahman, for many long years I have"
7147,SECTION CXI.,"been living upon this corpse still I have not done with it. O Saint, I,"
7148,SECTION CXI.,"too, derive satisfaction from it; I now understand that thou art the"
7149,SECTION CXI.,illustrious Agastya born of a Kumbha; for none else is capable of coming
7150,SECTION CXI.,"here; do thou therefore save me from this pain, who am afflicted with"
7151,SECTION CXI.,"great miseries. O foremost of twice-born ones, O gentle one, do thou"
7152,SECTION CXI.,take this ornament; may good betide thee. Do thou be propitiated with
7153,SECTION CXI.,"me. O Brahman, I do confer upon thee, gold, riches various clothes,"

7156,SECTION CXI.,"Hearing those words of the heavenly being, exciting pity, I accepted"
7157,SECTION CXI.,this ornament for saving him. And as soon as I took this ornament that
7158,SECTION CXI.,"human body of the royal saint disappeared. And the body being dissolved,"
7159,SECTION CXI.,"the royal saint Sweta, greatly delighted, happily went to the land of"

7172,SECTION CXII.,did he proceed to that forest devoid of men and animals for undergoing
7173,SECTION CXII.,"penances? I wish to hear the truth."" Hearing the words of Rāma stricken"
7174,SECTION CXII.,"with curiosity, the highly effulgent saint Agastya said:—""O Rāma,"
7175,SECTION CXII.,"formerly in the golden age, Manu was the king. His son was Ikshwāku."
7176,SECTION CXII.,"Having installed the irrepressible Ikshwāku, Manu said: ’Be thou the"
7177,SECTION CXII.,lord over creatures.’ Saying ’So be it’ Ikshwāku accepted the command.
7178,SECTION CXII.,Thereupon greatly delighted Manu said to his son:—’I have been highly
7179,SECTION CXII.,pleased with thee. For sooth thou shalt become a very liberal prince.
7180,SECTION CXII.,"Thou shalt govern the subjects meting out proper punishment unto them,"
7181,SECTION CXII.,"but do not punish them without any fault. If the punishment, which a"
7182,SECTION CXII.,"king inflicts upon the guilty, be just it becomes the instrumental in"
7183,SECTION CXII.,"taking the giver to heaven. Therefore, O my son having large arms, be"
7184,SECTION CXII.,particularly studious as regards punishment for thereby thou shalt
7185,SECTION CXII.,acquire great piety.’ Having in this wise advised Ikshwāku Manu
7186,SECTION CXII.,"delightedly repaired to the region of Brahmā. After Manu’s departure,"
7187,SECTION CXII.,the effulgent Ikshwāku thought of the means for creating progeny.
7188,SECTION CXII.,Thereupon performing many pious rites Manu’s son engendered a hundred
7189,SECTION CXII.,"sons. O descendant of Raghu, the youngest of all those sons became"
7190,SECTION CXII.,stupid and ignorant and did not respect his elder brothers. And thinking
7191,SECTION CXII.,that he should therefore be punished he named this son ’Danda.’
7192,SECTION CXII.,Thereupon finding no other province worthy of Danda he allotted the
7193,SECTION CXII.,region between Vindhya and Saivala to him. Danda became king of that
7194,SECTION CXII.,picturesque valley. And having reared a fine city there he named it as
7195,SECTION CXII.,Madhumanta and appointed Sukracharja of firm vows as his priest. Having
7196,SECTION CXII.,"thus established his kingdom, Danda, with his priest, began to lord over"
7197,SECTION CXII.,it filled with healthy and delighted people like unto the lord of
7198,SECTION CXII.,"celestials in their region. O Rāma, like unto Mahendra governing his"

7221,SECTION XCIII.,"hermitage—king, do not touch me forcibly for I am a maid and hence under"

7389,SECTION CXVII.,wished-for objects; roots and fruits were tasteful and flowers were
7390,SECTION CXVII.,fragrant. Without being cultivated earth used to yield crops. In this

7392,SECTION CXVII.,Thereupon he determined upon performing a hard penance. He considered

7396,SECTION CXVII.,"being thus engaged in asceticism, Indra, greatly terrified, approached"

7433,SECTION XCVIII.,observed that the leading Asura was spreading rays all over—the outcome
7434,SECTION XCVIII.,"of his own effulgence, as if devouring the three worlds and burning down"

7444,SECTION XCVIII.,"consequent upon the destruction of a Brahman, pursuing him vehemently,"
7445,SECTION XCVIII.,entered into his person. In this wise Indra became subject to dreadful

7511,SECTION C.,"one, I have heard, that formerly in the province of Valheeka, the"

7524,SECTION C.,"pretext of hunting, slew hundreds and thousands of deer. With slaying"

7537,SECTION C.,thinking that the misfortune was owing to the influence of the god of

7545,SECTION C.,"pray for any other boon. Being stricken with great sorrow, the king,"
7546,SECTION C.,"with whole heart, saluted the daughter of the mountain-chief and"
7547,SECTION C.,"said:—’O goddess, thou art the protectress of all—thou dost confer boons"

7715,SECTION CIV.,"Lakshmana, of unmitigated prowess, invited all those Brāhmanas and"
7716,SECTION CIV.,"approached Rāma. Seeing them, Rāma saluted them touching their feet. And"
7717,SECTION CIV.,"the Brāhmanas too, beholding the irrepressible celestial, like Rāghava,"
7718,SECTION CIV.,"welcomed him with blessings. Thereupon Rāma, with folded hands, asked of"
7719,SECTION CIV.,"those leading twice-born ones, questions regarding the Aswamedha"
7720,SECTION CIV.,"sacrifice. And hearing the words of Rāma, they, too, saluting the deity"

7722,SECTION CIV.,being informed from the Brāhmanas of many unheard of virtues of
7723,SECTION CIV.,"Ashwamedha, Rāma was greatly delighted. And according to their desire he"
7724,SECTION CIV.,"said to Lakshmana:—""O thou having long arms, do thou soon send an"
7725,SECTION CIV.,"emissary to the high-souled Sugriva, communicating unto him ’Do thou"
7726,SECTION CIV.,come here to enjoy festivities in the company of all those highly

7733,SECTION CIV.,"me. O thou having long arms, do thou also invite the Rishis, having"
7734,SECTION CIV.,asceticism for their wealth and other pious Brāhmanas living in various
7735,SECTION CIV.,provinces. Do thou also invite actors and songsters. Do thou order that
7736,SECTION CIV.,"a spacious, sacrificial ground may be made on the banks of the river"

7778,SECTION CV.,the horse-sacrifice commenced. Lakshmana engaged in looking after the
7779,SECTION CV.,"sacrificial horse. In this wise Rāma, a lion amongst the kings,"
7780,SECTION CV.,undertook the celebration of the horse-sacrifice. And in that Ashwamedha
7781,SECTION CV.,of Rāma presents were given unto people as long as they were not

7790,SECTION CV.,"gold, obtained it, those who wished for property got it and those, who"
7791,SECTION CV.,"longed for jewels, received them. In this wise before all, enough of"

7794,SECTION CV.,"Varuna’s."" And being present everywhere the Rākshasas and Vānaras gave"

7808,SECTION CVI.,"celestials, his followers, the Rishis, made charming cottages in a"

7810,SECTION CVI.,of Vālmiki they placed his picturesque car full of fruits and roots.
7811,SECTION CVI.,"Thereupon Vālmiki said to his disciples, Lava and Kusa:—""Do ye carefully"

7820,SECTION CVI.,"the Rāmāyana, you may fearlessly sing it there in due and measures"
7821,SECTION CVI.,"before the assembled ascetics. During the day do ye sing, in your sweet"
7822,SECTION CVI.,"voice, twenty sections out of many I have laid in the Rāmāyana"
7823,SECTION CVI.,"consisting of many slokas. Do not cherish the least longing for riches,"
7824,SECTION CVI.,what avail is wealth unto ascetics living perpetually on fruits and
7825,SECTION CVI.,"roots? If Rāma asks you about your father you may say, ’We are both"
7826,SECTION CVI.,"disciples of the high souled Vālmiki.’ O Kusa and Lava, in your proper"
7827,SECTION CVI.,mood do you sing the sweet song with charming Murchanā accompanied by
7828,SECTION CVI.,"the sweet notes of Vina. Before you begin with the song, without"
7829,SECTION CVI.,"disregarding the king, do you bow unto him reverentially. Morally the"
7830,SECTION CVI.,"king is the father of all. Do you therefore both, delightedly and with a"
7831,SECTION CVI.,"collected mind, early in the morning, sing the theme in a sweet voice"
7832,SECTION CVI.,"and accompanied by the music of the stringed instrument."" Having in this"
7833,SECTION CVI.,"wise given counsels, the highly generous and great ascetic Vālmiki, son"
7834,SECTION CVI.,"of Pracheta, became silent. Being thus commanded by the ascetic,"
7835,SECTION CVI.,"Janakis’ sons, Lava and Kusa, the slayers of enemies, issued out"

7848,SECTION CVII.,That song was composed by the first preceptor (Vālmiki) never heard of
7849,SECTION CVII.,"before, consisting of sounds originating from six places, containing all"
7850,SECTION CVII.,"metres, many proofs and set in accompaniment with the music of a"
7851,SECTION CVII.,stringed instrument. Hearing such a song from the boys Rāma was striken
7852,SECTION CVII.,with curiosity. Thereupon taking leave from business for some time and
7853,SECTION CVII.,"inviting the great ascetic Vālmiki, kings, learned men, persons"
7854,SECTION CVII.,"well-versed in Nyaya, Puranas and science of words, all old men,"

7862,SECTION CVII.,"those well-versed in reasonings and arguments, poets, historians, Vedic"
7863,SECTION CVII.,"Brāhmanas, painters, and songsters Rāma requested Lava and Kusa lovingly"
7864,SECTION CVII.,to sing the song before the assembly. The audience being seated there
7865,SECTION CVII.,and engaged in conversation with one another those two Muni boys began
7866,SECTION CVII.,with the song enhancing the delight of all. Wondrous and charming was
7867,SECTION CVII.,their song and the audience were not by any means satiated with the
7868,SECTION CVII.,hearing thereof. Greatly delighted the highly effulgent ascetics and
7869,SECTION CVII.,kings again and again looked towards them as if drinking them up with
7870,SECTION CVII.,their eyes. And they all attentively said to one another—“Both of them
7871,SECTION CVII.,"take after Rāma, like unto a bubble resembling the one it rises from."
7872,SECTION CVII.,There would not have been perceived the least difference between them
7873,SECTION CVII.,and Rāma had they not been clothed in bark and used clotted hair.” The
7874,SECTION CVII.,citizens and villagers speaking thus with one another Kusa and Lava
7875,SECTION CVII.,"chanted twenty sections beginning from the first, pointed out by Nārada."
7876,SECTION CVII.,"Having heard up to twentieth section, Rāma, fond of his brothers, said"
7877,SECTION CVII.,"to Lakshmana in the afternoon. “O Kākutstha, do thou soon confer upon"
7878,SECTION CVII.,these two high-souled ones eighteen thousand gold coins and all other
7879,SECTION CVII.,things they wish for.” Thereupon when Lakshmana addressed himself in no
7880,SECTION CVII.,"time to give them gold coins separately Kusa and Lava, not accepting"
7881,SECTION CVII.,"them and surprisingly said:—“We are dwellers of a forest, living upon"
7882,SECTION CVII.,roots and fruits—what shall we do with them (coins)? Therefore living in
7883,SECTION CVII.,the forest what shall we do with the gold?” Hearing those words Rāma and
7884,SECTION CVII.,the audience were greatly worked up with curiosity and surprise.
7885,SECTION CVII.,"Thereupon being anxious to learn of the origin of the poem, the highly"
7886,SECTION CVII.,"effulgent Rāma asked the two Muni boys, saying. ""What is the proof of"
7887,SECTION CVII.,the story of this poem? How great is his fame who has composed it? What
7888,SECTION CVII.,"leading ascetic is the author of this great poem?"" Rāma having thus"
7889,SECTION CVII.,"asked them those two Muni boys said:—""The illustrious Vālmiki is the"
7890,SECTION CVII.,author of this poem. He has described in this poem thine endless story.
7891,SECTION CVII.,He has of late come to thy sacrifice. The great ascetic Vālmiki has
7892,SECTION CVII.,composed this poem consisting of a hundred stories and twenty four
7893,SECTION CVII.,"thousand slokas. O king, that high-minded ascetic is our preceptor. He"
7894,SECTION CVII.,has described thy actions in six books beginning with the first
7895,SECTION CVII.,consisting of five hundred sections. All good actions performed by thee
7896,SECTION CVII.,"since thy birth have been recorded in this, O mighty car-warrior, O"
7897,SECTION CVII.,"king, if thou dost wish to hear the whole of it, do thou, at thy"
7898,SECTION CVII.,"leisure, hear it delightedly in the company of thy younger brothers."""
7899,SECTION CVII.,"Saying ""So it shall be,"" Rāma bade them adieu and they too, delighted,"
7900,SECTION CVII.,"repaired to where Vālmiki, the foremost of Munis was. Thereupon having"
7901,SECTION CVII.,heard that charming song in the company of ascetics and kings the
7902,SECTION CVII.,high-minded Rāma repaired to the place of business. He heard the
7903,SECTION CVII.,"Rāmāyana sung by Kusa and Lava, gifted with musical characteristics,"

7914,SECTION CVIII.,"and Lava were Jānaki’s sons, Rāma mentioning her name said before the"
7915,SECTION CVIII.,"assembly:—""Send a good emissary unto the illustrious Vālmiki and let him"
7916,SECTION CVIII.,communicate unto the ascetics that if Jānaki is sinless and has lead a
7917,SECTION CVIII.,pure life in the forest; let her give proof of purity by the great
7918,SECTION CVIII.,ascetic’s permission. Let the emissaries learn well the intention of the
7919,SECTION CVIII.,ascetic in this and if Sitā is at heart willing to bring in proofs. To
7920,SECTION CVIII.,"uphold her as well as mine purity, let Maithili, the daughter of Jānaka,"
7921,SECTION CVIII.,"swear before the assembly."" Hearing those wonderful words of Rāma, the"
7922,SECTION CVIII.,emissaries speedily went to Vālmiki and saluting the high-souled
7923,SECTION CVIII.,"(ascetic) burning in his effulgence and of incomparable lustre,"
7924,SECTION CVIII.,"communicated unto him, in sweet words all what Rāma had said. Hearing"
7925,SECTION CVIII.,the words of the messengers and understanding Rāma’s intention the
7926,SECTION CVIII.,"ascetic said:—""What Rāma has said shall be satisfied. May good betide"
7927,SECTION CVIII.,you. Husband is the greatest god for women. So Sitā shall carry out his
7928,SECTION CVIII.,"behests."" The great ascetic having said this, the highly powerful"
7929,SECTION CVIII.,"emissaries, approaching Rāma, communicated unto him what the Muni had"
7930,SECTION CVIII.,"said. Hearing the words of the high-souled Vālmiki, Rāma was greatly"
7931,SECTION CVIII.,"delighted. Having addressed the assembled Rishis and kings he said:—""The"
7932,SECTION CVIII.,"Rishis with their disciples, and the kings with their followers and all"
7933,SECTION CVIII.,"others willing shall see Sitā swear here."" Hearing the words of the"
7934,SECTION CVIII.,"high-souled Rāma, all the high-souled Rishis began to speak of him in"
7935,SECTION CVIII.,"high terms and said: ""O foremost of men, such an action becomes thee not"
7936,SECTION CVIII.,"any one else."" Thereupon having settled that Sitā would swear next day,"
7937,SECTION CVIII.,"Rāma, the slayer of enemies, dismissed them all. And having made"
7938,SECTION CVIII.,"arrangements that Sitā would go through the trial next day, the"

7955,SECTION CIX.,"Kshatryas, Vaisyas, Sudras and Brahmans of firm penances, also hailed"

7972,SECTION CIX.,"tell you the truth, O Rāma, that these irrepressible twin brothers are"

8008,SECTION CX.,"celestials all came there on the occasion. The Adityas, Vasus, Rudras,"
8009,SECTION CX.,"Viswadevas, Maruts, Sadhyas, Siddhas, Nagas and Rishis placing Brahmā"
8010,SECTION CX.,"before them, all came there. And beholding the celestials and Rishis"
8011,SECTION CX.,"assembled there Rāma again said to Vālmiki:—""O foremost of Munis, the"
8012,SECTION CX.,"words of the high-souled Rishis, are divested of sin; therefore on thy"
8013,SECTION CX.,words only I shall consider Sitā as having pure ways. Still all have
8014,SECTION CX.,come here being anxious to witness Sitā’s trial. I shall therefore be
8015,SECTION CX.,greatly delighted if Jānaki gives in before them any testimony of her
8016,SECTION CX.,"pure character."" As soon as those words were uttered, sweet, fragrant,"
8017,SECTION CX.,"cold air, the witness of virtue and vice, blowing mildly, excited the"
8018,SECTION CX.,"joy of the assembly. People, hailing from various countries, with all"
8019,SECTION CX.,attention began to witness this wondrous and unthought of event. In the
8020,SECTION CX.,golden age only the celestial wind used to blow—and it now blew even in
8021,SECTION CX.,the Treta Yuga and forsooth it was a matter of exceeding surprise.
8022,SECTION CX.,"Thereupon beholding all people assembled there, Janaka’s daughter,"
8023,SECTION CX.,"wearing a red cloth, with her face and looks downwards and folded palms"
8024,SECTION CX.,"said:—""I have never thought of any other person in my mind but Rāma; by"
8025,SECTION CX.,the strength of this virtue let the goddess Vasundharā give me room. I
8026,SECTION CX.,"have always with my mind, body and words prayed for Rāma’s well-being"
8027,SECTION CX.,and by virtue hereof may the goddess Vasundharā give me room in her
8028,SECTION CX.,"womb."" As soon as Sitā swore in this wise a wonderful incident took"
8029,SECTION CX.,place. From inside the earth a celestial and excellent throne rose up.
8030,SECTION CX.,"It was carried on head by the Nāgas of unmitigated prowess, having"
8031,SECTION CX.,celestial persons and adorned with celestial jewels and ornaments.
8032,SECTION CX.,"Having stretched out her arms and taken Maithili, the goddess earth"
8033,SECTION CX.,welcomed her and placed her on the throne. And while seated on the
8034,SECTION CX.,"throne she was entering the earth, she was covered with the continued"
8035,SECTION CX.,"showers of celestial flowers. Eulogising her at that time, the"
8036,SECTION CX.,"celestials said ""Oh! highly praiseworthy is thy conduct, O Sitā."" Being"
8037,SECTION CX.,"present in the welkin and beholding Sitā enter into the Earth, the"
8038,SECTION CX.,"celestials again and again eulogised her in various words. The Rishis,"
8039,SECTION CX.,kings and other leading men present in the sacrificial arena repeatedly
8040,SECTION CX.,expressed their surprise. Beholding Sitā’s censure thus removed all
8041,SECTION CX.,"animals, animate or inanimate, either on earth or in the sky, were"
8042,SECTION CX.,"greatly delighted. Some cried aloud in joy, some remained silent, and"
8043,SECTION CX.,some motionless espied Rāma or Sitā. In this wise beholding Sitā’s
8044,SECTION CX.,entrance into the Earth the ascetics were greatly delighted. They all
8045,SECTION CX.,"attaining to the same state of mind, the whole universe, for a moment,"
8046,SECTION CX.,was possessed with the state of equality.

8053,SECTION CXI.,"Sitā having entered Rasātala, all the monkeys and Rishis repeatedly"
8054,SECTION CXI.,eulogised her before Rāma. Stricken with sorrow and grief and lowering
8055,SECTION CXI.,"down his head, Rāma, with eyes full of tears, face downwards, and a"
8056,SECTION CXI.,"dejected mind, sat down. And being possessed by grief and anger and"
8057,SECTION CXI.,"shedding tears he wept for some time and then said:—""My mind is about to"
8058,SECTION CXI.,"be possessed by grief, which I had never experienced before, for in the"
8059,SECTION CXI.,"very presence of mine the graceful Jānaki, like Lakshmi herself, hath"
8060,SECTION CXI.,"disappeared from view. Formerly, in my absence, Jānaki was once carried"
8061,SECTION CXI.,"away into the city of Lankā, on the other side of the great ocean and I"
8062,SECTION CXI.,brought her back; what wonder it is that I shall get her back from
8063,SECTION CXI.,"Patāla? O goddess Vasudha, do thou soon bring Sitā in my view, or else,"
8064,SECTION CXI.,worked up with ire I shall give thee the fruits of thy negligence. Thou
8065,SECTION CXI.,"art my mother-in-law, since the royal saint Janaka obtained Sitā from"
8066,SECTION CXI.,thy womb while cultivating thee with plough share. Do thou therefore
8067,SECTION CXI.,"bring back my Sitā or give me a region of the celestials, I wish to live"
8068,SECTION CXI.,with Sitā. I am beside myself for her: do thou therefore bring back
8069,SECTION CXI.,"Sitā. If thou dost not render back Sitā unto me O Vasudha, I shall"
8070,SECTION CXI.,"deluge the earth with waters, having assailed, destroyed and drowned"
8071,SECTION CXI.,"into water thy huge compass with mountains and forests."" Rāma, having"
8072,SECTION CXI.,"given vent to those accents under the influence of ire, the patriarch"
8073,SECTION CXI.,"Brahmā, with the consent of the celestials, said:—""O Rāma of firm vows,"
8074,SECTION CXI.,"O slayer of enemies, thou shouldst not grieve thus. Recollect thy former"
8075,SECTION CXI.,state of Vishnu and the counsels. I would not have reminded thee of this
8076,SECTION CXI.,secret but for the present necessity. Do thou now once more remember thy
8077,SECTION CXI.,"birth from Vishnu. By nature, Sitā is pure, chaste and ever dependent"
8078,SECTION CXI.,upon thee. And by virtue of her ascetic dependance upon thee she has
8079,SECTION CXI.,"gone to the region of Nāgas. Thou shalt again meet her in heaven. Hear,"
8080,SECTION CXI.,what I communicate unto thee before the assembly. Thou shalt be informed
8081,SECTION CXI.,of everything by listening to this excellent poem describing thy own
8082,SECTION CXI.,"actions, O hero. Vālmiki has described herein all miseries and joys thou"
8083,SECTION CXI.,hast experienced since thy birth and what shall happen in future after
8084,SECTION CXI.,"Sitā’s entrance into Patala. O Rāma, this first epic poem, Rāmayan, has"
8085,SECTION CXI.,been composed describing thy works. None but thee is worthy of the fame
8086,SECTION CXI.,"of this poem. O Rāghava, O highly illustrious one, do thou hear with the"
8087,SECTION CXI.,"Rishis, Uttarakandam, the last portion of this poem. O descendant of"
8088,SECTION CXI.,"Raghu, this is not worthy of being heard by any but those who art the"
8089,SECTION CXI.,"foremost of the royal saints."" Having said this, the deity Brahmā, the"
8090,SECTION CXI.,"lord of the three worlds, with other deities, repaired to the region of"
8091,SECTION CXI.,"immortals. The high-souled and the highly effulgent ascetics, living in"
8092,SECTION CXI.,"Brahmā’s region, who were present in the assembly, obtaining Brahmā’s"
8093,SECTION CXI.,"permission, waited there, to hear Rāma’s future career in the"
8094,SECTION CXI.,Uttarakandam. Hearing the words of the great Patriarch instinct with
8095,SECTION CXI.,"well-being, the highly effulgent Rāma said to Vālmiki:—""O illustrious"
8096,SECTION CXI.,"sir, the Rishis living in Brahmā’s region have grown desirous of hearing"
8097,SECTION CXI.,"my future history. So let it be taken up next morning."" Having thus"
8098,SECTION CXI.,settled and taken with him Kusa and Lava and sent away the assembled
8099,SECTION CXI.,people he entered his palace and spent the night mourning for Sitā.

8108,SECTION CXII.,having taken their seats Kusa and Lava began the last portion of the
8109,SECTION CXII.,"Uttarakāndam. Sitā having entered Patala by the strength of her vow, and"
8110,SECTION CXII.,"the sacrifice having terminated, Rāma grew poorly in spirit. In Jānaki’s"
8111,SECTION CXII.,absence the whole world appeared to him as blank. Now being overwhelmed
8112,SECTION CXII.,with grief he lost all mental peace. Having conferred various gifts upon
8113,SECTION CXII.,"the kings, Rākshasas, monkeys, and leading Brāhmanas, Rāma sent them"
8114,SECTION CXII.,away and meditating upon Sitā’s absence entered Ayodhyā. And from the
8115,SECTION CXII.,time of Sitā’s entering into Patala he did not take any other spouse.
8116,SECTION CXII.,And having made a golden image of Sitā he engaged in the performance of
8117,SECTION CXII.,various sacrifices. In this wise for thousand years he celebrated many
8118,SECTION CXII.,"Horse-sacrifices, many Bajpeyas with profuse gold, Agnisomas, Atirātras,"
8119,SECTION CXII.,"numberless Gomedhas and various other sacrifices, Rāma being engaged in"
8120,SECTION CXII.,governing the kingdom and performing many pious rites long time passed
8121,SECTION CXII.,"away. And being under his subjection, bears, monkeys, Rākshasas and"
8122,SECTION CXII.,kings always afforded delight unto him. On account of showers in proper
8123,SECTION CXII.,time there was enough of food in his kingdom. The quarters were pure and
8124,SECTION CXII.,delightful. The citizens and villagers were happy and healthy. None met
8125,SECTION CXII.,"with premature death. In fact, in his regime all calamities were"
8126,SECTION CXII.,"removed. Thereupon after many years, the illustrious Kausalya, Rāma’s"
8127,SECTION CXII.,"mother, surrounded by her sons and grand-sons, breathed her last."
8128,SECTION CXII.,Performing many pious observances Kakeyi followed her and obtained peace
8129,SECTION CXII.,"in the land of immortals. Those noble ladies, being united with the king"
8130,SECTION CXII.,"Daçaratha, in heaven, were greatly delighted and obtained all virtues."
8131,SECTION CXII.,"Besides, having worshipped the deities and manes on the occasion of his"
8132,SECTION CXII.,father’s _Srādha_ ceremony the high-souled Rāma distributed many jewels
8133,SECTION CXII.,and engaged in the performance of a very difficult sacrifice. In this

8147,SECTION CXIII.,great saint Gargya with above valuable presents sent by his material
8148,SECTION CXIII.,"uncle Yudhajit, the intelligent Rāma, with his brothers, proceeded about"
8149,SECTION CXIII.,a Krosa to receive him and adored him particularly likely unto the lord
8150,SECTION CXIII.,of celestials honoring Vrihaspati. Having thus welcomed that foremost of
8151,SECTION CXIII.,Rishis and accepted the valuable presents sent by his maternal uncle he
8152,SECTION CXIII.,asked the ascetic about his welfare in every thing. Thereupon the great
8153,SECTION CXIII.,"Rishi being seated, he said:—""Thou art the foremost of those skilled in"
8154,SECTION CXIII.,the art of speech like the very preceptor of the celestials. Since thine
8155,SECTION CXIII.,own self hath come here my uncle must have commissioned thee with a very

8160,SECTION CXIII.,"and expert in warfare, guard that beautiful province abounding in fruits"
8161,SECTION CXIII.,"and roots on the banks of the river Sindhu. O hero, those Gandharvas are"

8163,SECTION CXIII.,hoisted thy flag of victory and conquered that highly picturesque city
8164,SECTION CXIII.,of Gandharvas do thou include that kingdom within thine well-established
8165,SECTION CXIII.,"territories. None can enter there. O thou having long arms, I do not"
8166,SECTION CXIII.,request thee for any harm of thine. Let that highly charming country be
8167,SECTION CXIII.,"liked by thee."" Hearing the words of the maternal uncle communicated by"
8168,SECTION CXIII.,"the great saint, Rāma, with delight, said:—""What you have commanded"
8169,SECTION CXIII.,"shall be satisfied."" Saying this he looked towards Bharta and"
8170,SECTION CXIII.,"delightedly and with folded hands said to the Rishi ""O Brahmarshi, these"
8171,SECTION CXIII.,two princes are Bharata’s sons and their names are Taksha and Pushkala.
8172,SECTION CXIII.,Being well protected by uncle Yudhajit and preceded by Bharata with army

8176,SECTION CXIII.,
8177,SECTION CXIII.,"Having thus said to the Brahmarshi, Rāma commanded Bharata and welcomed"

8180,SECTION CXIII.,issued out of the city of Ayodhyā. And Rāma’s army unconquerable even by
8181,SECTION CXIII.,"the celestials went on for a month, from the city like a celestial host"
8182,SECTION CXIII.,"under the command of Indra. Animals, living upon flesh and huge-bodied"

8196,SECTION ICXIV.,"powerful and light-armed Bharata and Yudhajit, with the soldiers and"
8197,SECTION ICXIV.,"followers, arrived at the city of Gandharvas. Having heard of the coming"
8198,SECTION ICXIV.,of Bharata the highly powerful Gandharvas gathered round and sent up
8199,SECTION ICXIV.,leonine roars. Thereupon began the battle capable of making down erect
8200,SECTION ICXIV.,and continued for a week. On neither side there was victory or defeat.
8201,SECTION ICXIV.,On all sides there flowed streams of blood and there were afloat human

8210,SECTION ICXIV.,set up two excellent and prosperous cities in the province of Gandharva.

8238,SECTION CXV.,And where if a kingdom is established it might not disturb the peace and
8239,SECTION CXV.,"happiness of other kings."" Rāma, having finished his speech Bharata"

8319,SECTION CXVII.,waters as the king of serpents. Then thou didst create two highly
8320,SECTION CXVII.,powerful Asuras named Madhu and Kaithabha. At that time the bones of
8321,SECTION CXVII.,those two Asuras having been scattered far and wide this earth
8322,SECTION CXVII.,containing many mountains was named _Medini_. Having procreated me in
8323,SECTION CXVII.,"thy lotus navel, dazzling in celestial brilliance thou didst employ me"
8324,SECTION CXVII.,in the work of generation. I took the charge and procreated men; but
8325,SECTION CXVII.,"finding no other means to preserve them I worshipped thee, the lord of"
8326,SECTION CXVII.,"the universe and said:—O lord, thou shouldst protect the creatures, for"
8327,SECTION CXVII.,thou art my father and giver of energy and therefore irrepressible.
8328,SECTION CXVII.,"Thereupon for concerting means for the preservation of creatures, thou"
8329,SECTION CXVII.,didst renounce thy irrepressible shape and assume Vishnu form. And
8330,SECTION CXVII.,"taking thy birth from Aditi’s powerful son, thou wert engaged in"
8331,SECTION CXVII.,enhancing the delight of my brothers. Thou didst use to protect the
8332,SECTION CXVII.,deities whenever they were assailed by any calamity. O lord of the
8333,SECTION CXVII.,"universe, it is for that reason, on beholding the destruction of"
8334,SECTION CXVII.,creatures thou wert born on earth to slay the Ten-necked demon. And at
8335,SECTION CXVII.,that time thou didst promise that thou wouldst live in the land of
8336,SECTION CXVII.,mortals for eleven thousand years. Thereupon thou didst assume a human
8337,SECTION CXVII.,form to carry out thine desire. Now that period is ripe and this is the
8338,SECTION CXVII.,"proper time to inform thee of it. O great king, do thou wait in this"
8339,SECTION CXVII.,land of mortals if dost thou wish to govern people for some time more.
8340,SECTION CXVII.,"And if dost thou wish to repair to the region of immortals, do thou"
8341,SECTION CXVII.,again lord over the deities in thy Vishnu form and let them be freed
8342,SECTION CXVII.,"from anxiety. O Hero, the Patriarch hath sent this intelligence unto"
8343,SECTION CXVII.,"thee."" Hearing those unequalled words of the Patriarch from the mouth of"
8344,SECTION CXVII.,"Kāla, the destroyer of all, Rāma smiling said:—""I have been greatly"
8345,SECTION CXVII.,"pleased and happy for thy coming here, O my son. I descended on earth to"
8346,SECTION CXVII.,bring about the well-being of the three worlds. May good betide thee. I
8347,SECTION CXVII.,shall now repair to from where I have come here. I was thinking of this
8348,SECTION CXVII.,"when thou didst come here. Therefore, I have no doubt in this. O lord of"
8349,SECTION CXVII.,"destruction, the immortals are dependent on me, so I shall be with them"
8350,SECTION CXVII.,"in all works. The Great Patriarch has said the truth."""
8351,SECTION CXVII.,
8352,SECTION CXVIII.,SECTION CXVIII.
8353,SECTION CXVIII.,
8354,SECTION CXVIII.,"While Rāma and Kāla were thus conversing with one another, the great"
8355,SECTION CXVIII.,ascetic Durvāsā arrived at the gate for seeing Rāma and approaching
8356,SECTION CXVIII.,"Lakshmana said:—""O Saumitri, do thou soon take me to Rāma; my time goes"
8357,SECTION CXVIII.,"away, so do thou take me first."" Hearing the words of the ascetic,"
8358,SECTION CXVIII.,"Lakshmana, the slayer of enemies worshipping the feet of that"
8359,SECTION CXVIII.,"high-souled one, said:—""O illustrious Sir, kindly mention thy business."
8360,SECTION CXVIII.,What is thy object? Order me what I am to do. Rāma is engaged in some
8361,SECTION CXVIII.,"business so kindly wait here for some time."" Hearing those words that"
8362,SECTION CXVIII.,"foremost of Rishis, Durvāsā, impatient with rage, said with blood-red"
8363,SECTION CXVIII.,"eyes:—""O Saumitri, if dost thou not go even this very moment and"
8364,SECTION CXVIII.,"communicate unto Rāma my arrival, I shall impricate thee, Rāma, Bharata,"
8365,SECTION CXVIII.,"Sutrughana, your sons and grand-sons. I shall curse also thy kingdom and"
8366,SECTION CXVIII.,"cities. I cannot any longer restrain my growing ire."" Hearing those"
8367,SECTION CXVIII.,"dreadful and resolute words of the Rishi, Lakshmana thought within"
8368,SECTION CXVIII.,"himself:—""My own destruction is far more desirable than that of all."""
8369,SECTION CXVIII.,Having thus resolved Lakshmana approached Rāma and communicated unto him
8370,SECTION CXVIII.,the intelligence. Hearing the words of Lakshmana and having bade adieu
8371,SECTION CXVIII.,"unto Kāla, Rāma soon came out and saw Atri’s son. And having saluted"
8372,SECTION CXVIII.,"that great and powerful ascetic he with folded hands, said ""What is"
8373,SECTION CXVIII.,"thine business?"" Hearing the words of Rāma, the highly powerful Durvāsā,"
8374,SECTION CXVIII.,"the foremost of Munis, said. ""Hear, O Rāma fond of virtue. For a"
8375,SECTION CXVIII.,thousand years I have carried on the vow of fasting. It has terminated
8376,SECTION CXVIII.,"to-day, so do thou give me food as much as possible."" Hearing those"
8377,SECTION CXVIII.,words Rāma was greatly delighted and gave proper food unto that ascetic.
8378,SECTION CXVIII.,"And feasting on that nectar-like sweet food, Durvāsā, the foremost of"
8379,SECTION CXVIII.,"Rishis, thanked Rāma and repaired to his own hermitage. Thereupon"
8380,SECTION CXVIII.,"remembering the words of Kāla, Rāma was greatly sorry. And thinking of"
8381,SECTION CXVIII.,those dreadful words he was overwhelmed with grief. And with a poorly
8382,SECTION CXVIII.,"heart, and face downwards he remained silent for some time. Thereupon"
8383,SECTION CXVIII.,thinking of Kāla’s words and determining that every calamity would
8384,SECTION CXVIII.,"befall him, that highly illustrious descendant, of Raghus, summoned"
8385,SECTION CXVIII.,patience.

8392,SECTION CXIX.,Thereupon beholding Rāma with his head downwards and poorly like unto
8393,SECTION CXIX.,"the moon possessed by Rāhu, Lakshmana, delightedly and with sweet words,"
8394,SECTION CXIX.,"said:—""Be not aggrieved for me, O thou having mighty arms. Such is the"
8395,SECTION CXIX.,course of time; the movements of creatures are destined by their
8396,SECTION CXIX.,"pristine actions, good or bad. O gentle one, do thou satisfy thy promise"
8397,SECTION CXIX.,"slaying me without any hesitation. O Kākuthstha, those, who cannot carry"
8398,SECTION CXIX.,"out their promises, repair to hell. O great king, if thou hast any love"
8399,SECTION CXIX.,"or affection for me, do thou satisfy thy promise by fearlessly slaying"
8400,SECTION CXIX.,"me."" Hearing those words of Lakshmana Rāma’s mind was greatly moved."
8401,SECTION CXIX.,Thereupon having invited his priests and ministers there he communicated
8402,SECTION CXIX.,unto them his promise and Durvāsā’s arrival. Hearing it the ministers
8403,SECTION CXIX.,"and priests remained silent. Thereupon Vasishtha, of unmitigated"
8404,SECTION CXIX.,"effulgence, said:—""O highly illustrious and mighty armed Rāma, I knew"
8405,SECTION CXIX.,"before by virtue of my asceticism, of this thy present destruction and"
8406,SECTION CXIX.,separation from Lakshmana. Time is powerful; do not falsify thy promise.
8407,SECTION CXIX.,Promises not carried out bring on the destruction of virtue. And on the
8408,SECTION CXIX.,"wane of virtue, forsooth, the three worlds, with celestials, saints,"
8409,SECTION CXIX.,"mobile and immobile creations, shall be destroyed. Therefore, O foremost"
8410,SECTION CXIX.,"of men, do thou protect, the universe by suffering separation from"
8411,SECTION CXIX.,"Lakshmana, in the interest of the preservation of the three worlds."" All"
8412,SECTION CXIX.,other ministers and priests agreed with Vasishtha’s words. Thereupon
8413,SECTION CXIX.,"hearing their moral counsels, Rāma said to Lakshmana before the"
8414,SECTION CXIX.,"assembly:—""O Lakshmana, it is not proper to act against morality, I do"
8415,SECTION CXIX.,therefore renounce thee; for the pious hold that destruction and
8416,SECTION CXIX.,"renounciation are all the same."" Rāma saying this, Lakshmana did not go"
8417,SECTION CXIX.,"to his own house, but with eyes full of tears specially repaired"
8418,SECTION CXIX.,therefrom. Having reached the banks of Saraju and rinsed his mouth he
8419,SECTION CXIX.,stood there with folded palms. And having obstructed all passages he did
8420,SECTION CXIX.,"not breathe any more. Lakshmana, the younger brother of Rāma, being thus"
8421,SECTION CXIX.,"engaged in penances, having obstructed his breath, Apsarās, Indra and"
8422,SECTION CXIX.,other deities and Rishis showered flowers on him. Thereupon beyond the
8423,SECTION CXIX.,"sight of men, having taken the highly powerful Lakshmana within his"
8424,SECTION CXIX.,"body, the king of celestials entered his own city. Thereupon beholding"
8425,SECTION CXIX.,"Lakshmana, the fourth portion of Vishnu arrived at their city the"
8426,SECTION CXIX.,celestials were greatly delighted and engaged in his worship.

8435,SECTION CXX.,"Bharata on the throne of Ayodhyā, I shall to-day repair to woods. Do ye,"
8436,SECTION CXX.,without any delay collect there all articles of installation. I shall
8437,SECTION CXX.,"follow the way which has been wended by Lakshmana."" Hearing the words of"
8438,SECTION CXX.,"Rāghava, the subjects with their heads downwards remained motionless"
8439,SECTION CXX.,like so many dead bodies. Hearing Rāma’s words Bharata was also
8440,SECTION CXX.,"stupified and speaking ill of the kingdom, said:—""O King, I swear by"
8441,SECTION CXX.,"truth, that far from kingdom I do not wish to live in heaven even"
8442,SECTION CXX.,"without thee: O King, of these two princes, Kusi and Lava do thou place"
8443,SECTION CXX.,Kusi in Kosala and Lava in North Kosala. And let quick-moving emissaries
8444,SECTION CXX.,go to Satrughna and communicate unto him the intelligence of our going
8445,SECTION CXX.,"there."" Hearing those words of Bharata and beholding the subjects"
8446,SECTION CXX.,"stricken with sorrow having their heads downwards, Vasishtha"
8447,SECTION CXX.,"said:—""Behold, O Rāma, the subjects have placed themselves on the"
8448,SECTION CXX.,"ground. Do thou, therefore; apprised of their intention, satisfy their"
8449,SECTION CXX.,"desire."" Raising up the subjects according to the words of Vasishtha"
8450,SECTION CXX.,"Rāma said:—""What good can I do for you!"" Hearing Rāma’s words they"
8451,SECTION CXX.,"said:—""O King, we shall follow thee wherever thou shalt go. If thou hast"
8452,SECTION CXX.,any love or affection for the citizens do thou permit them that they may
8453,SECTION CXX.,"follow thy good path with their wives and children. O lord, if thou dost"
8454,SECTION CXX.,"not forsake us, let us all go wherever thou wilt,—be it a forest, an"
8455,SECTION CXX.,"intractable tract, a river or an ocean. O great king, by this we shall"
8456,SECTION CXX.,be greatly delighted. We pray for this boon only. Our delight consists
8457,SECTION CXX.,"in following thee in everything."" Observing such a firm devotion of the"
8458,SECTION CXX.,citizens Rāma agreed to that. Thereupon having gone through his duties
8459,SECTION CXX.,he installed Kusi in the kingdom of Kosala and Lava in the northern
8460,SECTION CXX.,country. Having thus installed the high-souled and heroic Kusi and Lava
8461,SECTION CXX.,"and conferred upon each of them thousand chariots, Ajuta Nāgas, Ajuta"
8462,SECTION CXX.,horses and various jewels and riches he established them in their

8473,SECTION CXXI.,arrived there and communicated unto Satrughna the intelligence. Having
8474,SECTION CXXI.,"informed him of the renouncing of Lakshmana, Rāma’s promise and the"
8475,SECTION CXXI.,"following of the citizens they said:—""The intelligent Rāma has reared"
8476,SECTION CXXI.,for Kusi the spacious city of Kusavati at the foot of the Vindhya range.
8477,SECTION CXXI.,"The city of Sravanti has been reared for Lava, and the mighty"
8478,SECTION CXXI.,"car-warriors Rāma and Bharata, making Ayodhyā void of men, have"
8479,SECTION CXXI.,"addressed themselves for repairing to heaven."" Having speedily"
8480,SECTION CXXI.,communicated unto him this intelligence the emissaries took rest.
8481,SECTION CXXI.,Thereupon they asked Satrughna to proceed soon. Observing the dreadful
8482,SECTION CXXI.,"destruction of his race, Satrughna sent for his subjects and priests and"
8483,SECTION CXXI.,informed them of everything. He also communicated unto them his own
8484,SECTION CXXI.,destruction with his brothers. Thereupon the king Satrughna determined
8485,SECTION CXXI.,upon installing his two sons in the kingdom. Suvahu was placed on the
8486,SECTION CXXI.,throne of Mathura and Satrughati became the king of Vidisha. Having thus
8487,SECTION CXXI.,"established Suvahu in Mathura, and Satrughati in Vidisha, the great hero"
8488,SECTION CXXI.,Satrughna ascended his car and went to Ayodhyā. And there he saw the
8489,SECTION CXXI.,"great Rāma, clothed in silk raiment burning like fire in the midst of"
8490,SECTION CXXI.,"the ascetics. Thereupon remembering his duty he saluted Rāma, conversant"
8491,SECTION CXXI.,"with piety and with folded hands said:—""I have placed my two sons on the"
8492,SECTION CXXI.,"throne of my kingdom. I have now resolved upon following thee, O King. O"
8493,SECTION CXXI.,"hero, do not command me otherwise. I pray only that I may not neglect"
8494,SECTION CXXI.,"thy command."" Thereupon understanding the firm resolution of Satrughna,"
8495,SECTION CXXI.,"the descendant of Raghu agreed. Immediately after Rāma had said this,"
8496,SECTION CXXI.,"monkeys assuming shapes at will, bears, and Rakshas began to assemble"
8497,SECTION CXXI.,"there. Apprised of Rāma’s determination of going to heaven, monkeys,"
8498,SECTION CXXI.,"born of the celestials, Rishis and Gandharvas taking Sugriva before"
8499,SECTION CXXI.,"them, came there to see Rāma. And they all said:—""O Rāma, O foremost of"
8500,SECTION CXXI.,"men, if thou dost repair to heaven forsaking us all, it will be hurling"
8501,SECTION CXXI.,"Yama’s rod upon us."" The highly powerful Sugriva too saluting Rāma"
8502,SECTION CXXI.,"said:—""O lord of men, having placed Angada on the throne I have come"
8503,SECTION CXXI.,"hither. I have determined upon following thee, O King."" Hearing the"
8504,SECTION CXXI.,"words of monkeys, Rāma said that their desire would be fulfilled. He"
8505,SECTION CXXI.,"then said to Bibhishana the king of Rākshasas:—""As long as people shall"
8506,SECTION CXXI.,"breathe, O Bibhishana, O highly powerful lord of Rākshasas, thou shalt"
8507,SECTION CXXI.,"preserve thy body in Lankā. As long as the moon, the sun and the earth"
8508,SECTION CXXI.,"shall exist and as long as my story shall remain current, thy kingdom"
8509,SECTION CXXI.,"shall be in existence. Thou didst, out of friendship, carry out my"
8510,SECTION CXXI.,behests and perform my works. Do thou piously govern thy subjects. I
8511,SECTION CXXI.,"should not speak any thing else. What shall I say more unto thee, O"
8512,SECTION CXXI.,highly powerful lord of Rākshasas. Worship Jagannath (the lord of the
8513,SECTION CXXI.,"world), the presiding deity of the Ikshwāku race."" Having thus addressed"
8514,SECTION CXXI.,"the king of Rākshasas always obeying Rāghava’s command, Kākuthstha said"
8515,SECTION CXXI.,"to Hanumān:—""It is settled that thou shalt live forever, do thou, now"
8516,SECTION CXXI.,observe thy promise. As long as my history shall run current in this
8517,SECTION CXXI.,"world do thou at my command live happily."" Being thus addressed by the"
8518,SECTION CXXI.,"high-souled Rāghava Hanumān attained to great delight and said:—""As long"
8519,SECTION CXXI.,as the sacred theme shall pass current in this world I shall live here
8520,SECTION CXXI.,"carrying out thy commands."" Thereupon he said to the Jambhuvan, Brahmā’s"
8521,SECTION CXXI.,"son, Mainda, Dwivida and five others in his company:—""As long as the"
8522,SECTION CXXI.,"Kali Yuga exists do ye all live."" Having thus addressed them all"

8532,SECTION CXXII.,"brilliant umbrellas Agnihotra, and Bājapeya go with the Brāhmanas"
8533,SECTION CXXII.,"before, which look well in the great road."" Thereupon the highly"
8534,SECTION CXXII.,effulgent Vasishtha arranged duly all the ceremonies necessary for going
8535,SECTION CXXII.,"to the next world. Thereupon wearing a thin cloth, holding kusa grass by"
8536,SECTION CXXII.,"his fingers, and reciting Vedic hymns he proceeded to the banks of"
8537,SECTION CXXII.,"Saraju. Having given up all actions of senses, and suffered the pains of"
8538,SECTION CXXII.,going on foot he issued out of the city speechless like unto the burning
8539,SECTION CXXII.,"sun. On his right hand side was the lotus-handed Sree, on his left hand"
8540,SECTION CXXII.,side was the goddess Earth and before him was the power of destruction.
8541,SECTION CXXII.,"Various arrows, huge bows, and daggers, assuming forms followed him. And"
8542,SECTION CXXII.,"also went with him the four Vedas in the shape of the Brāhmanas, the all"
8543,SECTION CXXII.,"protecting Gayatri, Omkāra and Vasatkāra. The high-souled Rishis and"
8544,SECTION CXXII.,great Asuras followed the high-souled Rāma to the open gates of heaven.
8545,SECTION CXXII.,"All the female servants, old and young, the damsels of the seraglio"
8546,SECTION CXXII.,"accompanied by servants having no manhood, Bharata and Lakshmana"
8547,SECTION CXXII.,"accompanied by their wives, followed him with Agnihotra. All those"
8548,SECTION CXXII.,"high-souled ones, assembled there with Agnihotra and followed Kākuthstha"
8549,SECTION CXXII.,"with their wives and children. The ministers and the servants, with"
8550,SECTION CXXII.,"their sons, beasts and friends, followed Rāma delightedly. Thereupon all"
8551,SECTION CXXII.,"the subjects healthy and delighted went after Rāghava, attracted by his"
8552,SECTION CXXII.,"accomplishments and cleansed of their sins. All the females and males,"
8553,SECTION CXXII.,"with their beasts, birds and friends, delightedly followed Rāghava."
8554,SECTION CXXII.,"Bathed and delighted, all the monkeys, healthy and joyous following"
8555,SECTION CXXII.,"Rāma, created a continued tumult. There was none poorly, aggrieved or"
8556,SECTION CXXII.,miserable—all of them appeared wonderfully happy and delighted. When
8557,SECTION CXXII.,"Rāma issued out of the city, whoever came to see him followed him being"
8558,SECTION CXXII.,"desirous of going to heaven. Bears, monkeys and Rākshasas and all the"
8559,SECTION CXXII.,citizens followed him with great devotion and collected minds. And all
8560,SECTION CXXII.,"other animals, that were beyond the view of all in the city went after"
8561,SECTION CXXII.,"Rāghava proceeding to heaven. All creations mobile and immobile, whoever"
8562,SECTION CXXII.,"beheld Kākuthstha followed him. All beings in Ayodhyā, whoever breathe"

8572,SECTION CXXIII.,"crossed that river of rising waves to some extent, Rāma, with his"
8573,SECTION CXXIII.,followers arrived at the place where he should give up his person.
8574,SECTION CXXIII.,"Thereupon at that moment, Brahmā, the grandfather of all encircled by"
8575,SECTION CXXIII.,"all high-souled deities and with hundred kotis of celestial cars,"
8576,SECTION CXXIII.,arrived there where Kākuthstha had addressed himself to repair to
8577,SECTION CXXIII.,heaven. The aerial way was full of lustre but its brilliance was
8578,SECTION CXXIII.,increased the more by the native effulgence of the inhabitants of
8579,SECTION CXXIII.,"heavens, always performing pious actions. There blew the holy, fragrant"
8580,SECTION CXXIII.,and delightful winds and there fell profusely celestial flowers from the
8581,SECTION CXXIII.,hands of the deities. The place was filled with the noise of hundreds of
8582,SECTION CXXIII.,bugles sounded by Gandharvas and Apsarās. And then Rāma prepared himself
8583,SECTION CXXIII.,to descend to the waters of Saraju. Thereupon the Patriarch gave vent to
8584,SECTION CXXIII.,the following accents from the welkin:—“Come O Vishnu; may good betide
8585,SECTION CXXIII.,thee; by our good fortune thou art coming here; O Rāghava hear—O thou
8586,SECTION CXXIII.,"having mighty arms, do thou enter here with thy brothers, resembling the"
8587,SECTION CXXIII.,celestials in brilliance in whatever form thou likest—either in that of
8588,SECTION CXXIII.,the sky or in thy own Vishnu form. Thou art the refuge of the
8589,SECTION CXXIII.,creatures—nobody knoweth thee. Thou art above the range of thought;
8590,SECTION CXXIII.,"great immortal and imperishable; nobody knoweth thee save Māyā, having"
8591,SECTION CXXIII.,"wide eyes, thy former spouse. Do thou enter here thyself in whatever"
8592,SECTION CXXIII.,effulgent form thou likest.” Hearing the words of the Patriarch and
8593,SECTION CXXIII.,determining everything the high-minded Rāma entered there bodily with
8594,SECTION CXXIII.,his brothers in his Vishnu form. Thereupon all the celestials Sādhyas
8595,SECTION CXXIII.,"Marutas, headed by Indra and Agni worshipped that deity, Vishnu. So did"
8596,SECTION CXXIII.,"all the celestial Rishis, Gandharvas, Apsarās, Suparnas, Nāgas, Yakhas,"
8597,SECTION CXXIII.,"demons, Dānavas and Rākshasas. Thereupon eulogising him the celestials"
8598,SECTION CXXIII.,"said:—""Our region is now freed from sins and all here have been"
8599,SECTION CXXIII.,"delighted and all their desires have been fulfilled."" Thereupon the"
8600,SECTION CXXIII.,"highly effulgent Vishnu said to the Patriarch Brahmā:—""It behoveth thee,"
8601,SECTION CXXIII.,"O thou of good vows, to allot to those people their proper regions."
8602,SECTION CXXIII.,These illustrious ones have followed me out of love. They are worthy of

8605,SECTION CXXIII.,"creatures, said:—""All these people who have come here shall go to the"
8606,SECTION CXXIII.,"region named Santanaka. This region is intended even for him, who though"
8607,SECTION CXXIII.,"born in the most degraded state, thinks of all objects as Vishnu. There"
8608,SECTION CXXIII.,"is no question about their attaining to this region who, out of"
8609,SECTION CXXIII.,"devotion, have followed thee and renounced their persons. This region"
8610,SECTION CXXIII.,has all the attributes of the Brahmā region and is next to it. The
8611,SECTION CXXIII.,monkeys and bears shall enter into their respective celestial forms.
8612,SECTION CXXIII.,They shall enter into the deities from whom they had respectively
8613,SECTION CXXIII.,originated. Sugriva shall enter into the Sun’s region. And they shall

8615,SECTION CXXIII.,"The lord of the deities having said this, all those who were present at"
8616,SECTION CXXIII.,the holy pilgrimage of _Gopratra_ descended into the waters of Saraju
8617,SECTION CXXIII.,"with eyes full of tears of joy. Having bathed there, given up their"

8636,SECTION CXXIV.,composed by Vālmiki and passes as the foremost of all under the name of
8637,SECTION CXXIV.,"the Rāmāyana. Thereupon as before, Vishnu, who compriseth the three"
8638,SECTION CXXIV.,"worlds and all objects, mobile and immobile, again established himself"
8639,SECTION CXXIV.,as before in the land of immortals. Thereupon the celestials the
8640,SECTION CXXIV.,"Gandharvas, the great Rishis used to hear happily every day in heaven"

8642,SECTION CXXIV.,"this Rāmāyana sacred like the Vedas, removing sins and increasing life"
8643,SECTION CXXIV.,"and prosperity. Reading even a single verse of this poem, one who hath"
8644,SECTION CXXIV.,"no son, obtaineth him; one having no riches, gets by them—and people are"
8645,SECTION CXXIV.,freed from all sins. By reading even one sloka people are freed from all
8646,SECTION CXXIV.,"sins which they commit every day. Clothes, cows, and gold should be"

8649,SECTION CXXIV.,conferring a long life is honoured in this world along with his sons and
8650,SECTION CXXIV.,grand-sons and as well as in the land of the dead. Whoever shall read
8651,SECTION CXXIV.,"this Rāmāyana either in the morning, noon, or evening, shall never be"
8652,SECTION CXXIV.,wearied. The picturesque city of Ayodhyā remained devoid of men for many
8653,SECTION CXXIV.,"long years but was again peopled under the regime of the King Rishava,"
8654,SECTION CXXIV.,"Pracheta’s son Vālmiki composed this poem, conferring long life,"
