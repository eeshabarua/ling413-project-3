45,INTRODUCTION.,INTRODUCTION.
46,INTRODUCTION.,
47,INTRODUCTION.,
48,INTRODUCTION.,"Scepticism is as much the result of knowledge, as knowledge is of"
49,INTRODUCTION.,"scepticism. To be content with what we at present know, is, for the"
50,INTRODUCTION.,"most part, to shut our ears against conviction; since, from the very"
51,INTRODUCTION.,"gradual character of our education, we must continually forget, and"
52,INTRODUCTION.,"emancipate ourselves from, knowledge previously acquired; we must set"
53,INTRODUCTION.,"aside old notions and embrace fresh ones; and, as we learn, we must be"
54,INTRODUCTION.,daily unlearning something which it has cost us no small labour and
55,INTRODUCTION.,anxiety to acquire.
56,INTRODUCTION.,
57,INTRODUCTION.,And this difficulty attaches itself more closely to an age in which
58,INTRODUCTION.,"progress has gained a strong ascendency over prejudice, and in which"
59,INTRODUCTION.,"persons and things are, day by day, finding their real level, in lieu"
60,INTRODUCTION.,of their conventional value. The same principles which have swept away
61,INTRODUCTION.,"traditional abuses, and which are making rapid havoc among the revenues"
62,INTRODUCTION.,"of sinecurists, and stripping the thin, tawdry veil from attractive"
63,INTRODUCTION.,"superstitions, are working as actively in literature as in society. The"
64,INTRODUCTION.,"credulity of one writer, or the partiality of another, finds as"
65,INTRODUCTION.,powerful a touchstone and as wholesome a chastisement in the healthy
66,INTRODUCTION.,"scepticism of a temperate class of antagonists, as the dreams of"
67,INTRODUCTION.,"conservatism, or the impostures of pluralist sinecures in the Church."
68,INTRODUCTION.,"History and tradition, whether of ancient or comparatively recent"
69,INTRODUCTION.,"times, are subjected to very different handling from that which the"
70,INTRODUCTION.,indulgence or credulity of former ages could allow. Mere statements are
71,INTRODUCTION.,"jealously watched, and the motives of the writer form as important an"
72,INTRODUCTION.,"ingredient in the analysis of his history, as the facts he records."
73,INTRODUCTION.,Probability is a powerful and troublesome test; and it is by this
74,INTRODUCTION.,troublesome standard that a large portion of historical evidence is
75,INTRODUCTION.,sifted. Consistency is no less pertinacious and exacting in its
76,INTRODUCTION.,"demands. In brief, to write a history, we must know more than mere"
77,INTRODUCTION.,"facts. Human nature, viewed under an introduction of extended"
78,INTRODUCTION.,"experience, is the best help to the criticism of human history."
79,INTRODUCTION.,Historical characters can only be estimated by the standard which human
80,INTRODUCTION.,"experience, whether actual or traditionary, has furnished. To form"
81,INTRODUCTION.,correct views of individuals we must regard them as forming parts of a
82,INTRODUCTION.,great whole—we must measure them by their relation to the mass of
83,INTRODUCTION.,"beings by whom they are surrounded; and, in contemplating the incidents"
84,INTRODUCTION.,"in their lives or condition which tradition has handed down to us, we"
85,INTRODUCTION.,"must rather consider the general bearing of the whole narrative, than"
86,INTRODUCTION.,the respective probability of its details.
87,INTRODUCTION.,
88,INTRODUCTION.,"It is unfortunate for us, that, of some of the greatest men, we know"
89,INTRODUCTION.,"least, and talk most. Homer, Socrates, and Shakespere have, perhaps,"
90,INTRODUCTION.,contributed more to the intellectual enlightenment of mankind than any
91,INTRODUCTION.,"other three writers who could be named, and yet the history of all"
92,INTRODUCTION.,"three has given rise to a boundless ocean of discussion, which has left"
93,INTRODUCTION.,us little save the option of choosing which theory or theories we will
94,INTRODUCTION.,"follow. The personality of Shakespere is, perhaps, the only thing in"
95,INTRODUCTION.,which critics will allow us to believe without controversy; but upon
96,INTRODUCTION.,"everything else, even down to the authorship of plays, there is more or"
97,INTRODUCTION.,less of doubt and uncertainty. Of Socrates we know as little as the
98,INTRODUCTION.,contradictions of Plato and Xenophon will allow us to know. He was one
99,INTRODUCTION.,of the _dramatis personæ_ in two dramas as unlike in principles as in
100,INTRODUCTION.,style. He appears as the enunciator of opinions as different in their
101,INTRODUCTION.,tone as those of the writers who have handed them down. When we have
102,INTRODUCTION.,"read Plato _or_ Xenophon, we think we know something of Socrates; when"
103,INTRODUCTION.,"we have fairly read and examined both, we feel convinced that we are"
104,INTRODUCTION.,something worse than ignorant.
105,INTRODUCTION.,
106,INTRODUCTION.,"It has been an easy, and a popular expedient of late years, to deny the"
107,INTRODUCTION.,personal or real existence of men and things whose life and condition
108,INTRODUCTION.,were too much for our belief. This system—which has often comforted the
109,INTRODUCTION.,"religious sceptic, and substituted the consolations of Strauss for"
110,INTRODUCTION.,those of the New Testament—has been of incalculable value to the
111,INTRODUCTION.,historical theorists of the last and present centuries. To question the
112,INTRODUCTION.,"existence of Alexander the Great, would be a more excusable act, than"
113,INTRODUCTION.,"to believe in that of Romulus. To deny a fact related in Herodotus,"
114,INTRODUCTION.,because it is inconsistent with a theory developed from an Assyrian
115,INTRODUCTION.,"inscription which no two scholars read in the same way, is more"
116,INTRODUCTION.,"pardonable, than to believe in the good-natured old king whom the"
117,INTRODUCTION.,elegant pen of Florian has idealized—_Numa Pompilius_.
118,INTRODUCTION.,
119,INTRODUCTION.,"Scepticism has attained its culminating point with respect to Homer,"
120,INTRODUCTION.,and the state of our Homeric knowledge may be described as a free
121,INTRODUCTION.,"permission to believe any theory, provided we throw overboard all"
122,INTRODUCTION.,"written tradition, concerning the author or authors of the Iliad and"
123,INTRODUCTION.,"Odyssey. What few authorities exist on the subject, are summarily"
124,INTRODUCTION.,"dismissed, although the arguments appear to run in a circle. “This"
125,INTRODUCTION.,"cannot be true, because it is not true; and that is not true, because"
126,INTRODUCTION.,"it cannot be true.” Such seems to be the style, in which testimony upon"
127,INTRODUCTION.,"testimony, statement upon statement, is consigned to denial and"
128,INTRODUCTION.,oblivion.
129,INTRODUCTION.,
130,INTRODUCTION.,"It is, however, unfortunate that the professed biographies of Homer are"
131,INTRODUCTION.,"partly forgeries, partly freaks of ingenuity and imagination, in which"
132,INTRODUCTION.,truth is the requisite most wanting. Before taking a brief review of
133,INTRODUCTION.,"the Homeric theory in its present conditions, some notice must be taken"
134,INTRODUCTION.,of the treatise on the Life of Homer which has been attributed to
135,INTRODUCTION.,Herodotus.
136,INTRODUCTION.,
137,INTRODUCTION.,"According to this document, the city of Cumae in AEolia was, at an"
138,INTRODUCTION.,"early period, the seat of frequent immigrations from various parts of"
139,INTRODUCTION.,"Greece. Among the immigrants was Menapolus, the son of Ithagenes."
140,INTRODUCTION.,"Although poor, he married, and the result of the union was a girl named"
141,INTRODUCTION.,"Critheis. The girl was left an orphan at an early age, under the"
142,INTRODUCTION.,"guardianship of Cleanax, of Argos. It is to the indiscretion of this"
143,INTRODUCTION.,maiden that we “are indebted for so much happiness.” Homer was the
144,INTRODUCTION.,"first fruit of her juvenile frailty, and received the name of"
145,INTRODUCTION.,"Melesigenes from having been born near the river Meles in Bœotia,"
146,INTRODUCTION.,whither Critheis had been transported in order to save her reputation.
147,INTRODUCTION.,
148,INTRODUCTION.,"“At this time,” continues our narrative, “there lived at Smyrna a man"
149,INTRODUCTION.,"named Phemius, a teacher of literature and music, who, not being"
150,INTRODUCTION.,"married, engaged Critheis to manage his household, and spin the flax he"
151,INTRODUCTION.,received as the price of his scholastic labours. So satisfactory was
152,INTRODUCTION.,"her performance of this task, and so modest her conduct, that he made"
153,INTRODUCTION.,"proposals of marriage, declaring himself, as a further inducement,"
154,INTRODUCTION.,"willing to adopt her son, who, he asserted, would become a clever man,"
155,INTRODUCTION.,if he were carefully brought up.”
156,INTRODUCTION.,
157,INTRODUCTION.,They were married; careful cultivation ripened the talents which nature
158,INTRODUCTION.,"had bestowed, and Melesigenes soon surpassed his schoolfellows in every"
159,INTRODUCTION.,"attainment, and, when older, rivalled his preceptor in wisdom. Phemius"
160,INTRODUCTION.,"died, leaving him sole heir to his property, and his mother soon"
161,INTRODUCTION.,followed. Melesigenes carried on his adopted father’s school with great
162,INTRODUCTION.,"success, exciting the admiration not only of the inhabitants of Smyrna,"
163,INTRODUCTION.,"but also of the strangers whom the trade carried on there, especially"
164,INTRODUCTION.,"in the exportation of corn, attracted to that city. Among these"
165,INTRODUCTION.,"visitors, one Mentes, from Leucadia, the modern Santa Maura, who"
166,INTRODUCTION.,"evinced a knowledge and intelligence rarely found in those times,"
167,INTRODUCTION.,"persuaded Melesigenes to close his school, and accompany him on his"
168,INTRODUCTION.,"travels. He promised not only to pay his expenses, but to furnish him"
169,INTRODUCTION.,"with a further stipend, urging, that, “While he was yet young, it was"
170,INTRODUCTION.,fitting that he should see with his own eyes the countries and cities
171,INTRODUCTION.,which might hereafter be the subjects of his discourses.” Melesigenes
172,INTRODUCTION.,"consented, and set out with his patron, “examining all the curiosities"
173,INTRODUCTION.,"of the countries they visited, and informing himself of everything by"
174,INTRODUCTION.,"interrogating those whom he met.” We may also suppose, that he wrote"
175,INTRODUCTION.,memoirs of all that he deemed worthy of preservation. Having set sail
176,INTRODUCTION.,"from Tyrrhenia and Iberia, they reached Ithaca. Here Melesigenes, who"
177,INTRODUCTION.,"had already suffered in his eyes, became much worse; and Mentes, who"
178,INTRODUCTION.,"was about to leave for Leucadia, left him to the medical"
179,INTRODUCTION.,"superintendence of a friend of his, named Mentor, the son of Alcinor."
180,INTRODUCTION.,"Under his hospitable and intelligent host, Melesigenes rapidly became"
181,INTRODUCTION.,"acquainted with the legends respecting Ulysses, which afterwards formed"
182,INTRODUCTION.,"the subject of the Odyssey. The inhabitants of Ithaca assert, that it"
183,INTRODUCTION.,"was here that Melesigenes became blind, but the Colophonians make their"
184,INTRODUCTION.,"city the seat of that misfortune. He then returned to Smyrna, where he"
185,INTRODUCTION.,applied himself to the study of poetry.
186,INTRODUCTION.,
187,INTRODUCTION.,But poverty soon drove him to Cumae. Having passed over the Hermaean
188,INTRODUCTION.,"plain, he arrived at Neon Teichos, the New Wall, a colony of Cumae."
189,INTRODUCTION.,Here his misfortunes and poetical talent gained him the friendship of
190,INTRODUCTION.,"one Tychias, an armourer. “And up to my time,” continues the author,"
191,INTRODUCTION.,“the inhabitants showed the place where he used to sit when giving a
192,INTRODUCTION.,recitation of his verses; and they greatly honoured the spot. Here also
193,INTRODUCTION.,"a poplar grew, which they said had sprung up ever since Melesigenes"
194,INTRODUCTION.,arrived.”
195,INTRODUCTION.,
196,INTRODUCTION.,"But poverty still drove him on, and he went by way of Larissa, as being"
197,INTRODUCTION.,"the most convenient road. Here, the Cumans say, he composed an epitaph"
198,INTRODUCTION.,"on Gordius, king of Phrygia, which has however, and with greater"
199,INTRODUCTION.,"probability, been attributed to Cleobulus of Lindus."
200,INTRODUCTION.,
201,INTRODUCTION.,"Arrived at Cumae, he frequented the _conversaziones_ of the old men,"
202,INTRODUCTION.,and delighted all by the charms of his poetry. Encouraged by this
203,INTRODUCTION.,"favourable reception, he declared that, if they would allow him a"
204,INTRODUCTION.,"public maintenance, he would render their city most gloriously"
205,INTRODUCTION.,renowned. They avowed their willingness to support him in the measure
206,INTRODUCTION.,"he proposed, and procured him an audience in the council. Having made"
207,INTRODUCTION.,"the speech, with the purport of which our author has forgotten to"
208,INTRODUCTION.,"acquaint us, he retired, and left them to debate respecting the answer"
209,INTRODUCTION.,to be given to his proposal.
210,INTRODUCTION.,
211,INTRODUCTION.,The greater part of the assembly seemed favourable to the poet’s
212,INTRODUCTION.,"demand, but one man “observed that if they were to feed _Homers_, they"
213,INTRODUCTION.,would be encumbered with a multitude of useless people.” “From this
214,INTRODUCTION.,"circumstance,” says the writer, “Melesigenes acquired the name of"
215,INTRODUCTION.,"Homer, for the Cumans call blind men _Homers_.” With a love of economy,"
216,INTRODUCTION.,which shows how similar the world has always been in its treatment of
217,INTRODUCTION.,"literary men, the pension was denied, and the poet vented his"
218,INTRODUCTION.,disappointment in a wish that Cumae might never produce a poet capable
219,INTRODUCTION.,of giving it renown and glory.
220,INTRODUCTION.,
221,INTRODUCTION.,At Phocaea Homer was destined to experience another literary distress.
222,INTRODUCTION.,"One Thestorides, who aimed at the reputation of poetical genius, kept"
223,INTRODUCTION.,"Homer in his own house, and allowed him a pittance, on condition of the"
224,INTRODUCTION.,verses of the poet passing in his name. Having collected sufficient
225,INTRODUCTION.,"poetry to be profitable, Thestorides, like some would-be literary"
226,INTRODUCTION.,"publishers, neglected the man whose brains he had sucked, and left him."
227,INTRODUCTION.,"At his departure, Homer is said to have observed: “O Thestorides, of"
228,INTRODUCTION.,"the many things hidden from the knowledge of man, nothing is more"
229,INTRODUCTION.,unintelligible than the human heart.”
230,INTRODUCTION.,
231,INTRODUCTION.,"Homer continued his career of difficulty and distress, until some Chian"
232,INTRODUCTION.,"merchants, struck by the similarity of the verses they heard him"
233,INTRODUCTION.,"recite, acquainted him with the fact that Thestorides was pursuing a"
234,INTRODUCTION.,profitable livelihood by the recital of the very same poems. This at
235,INTRODUCTION.,once determined him to set out for Chios. No vessel happened then to be
236,INTRODUCTION.,"setting sail thither, but he found one ready to start for Erythrae, a"
237,INTRODUCTION.,"town of Ionia, which faces that island, and he prevailed upon the"
238,INTRODUCTION.,"seamen to allow him to accompany them. Having embarked, he invoked a"
239,INTRODUCTION.,"favourable wind, and prayed that he might be able to expose the"
240,INTRODUCTION.,"imposture of Thestorides, who, by his breach of hospitality, had drawn"
241,INTRODUCTION.,down the wrath of Jove the Hospitable.
242,INTRODUCTION.,
243,INTRODUCTION.,"At Erythrae, Homer fortunately met with a person who had known him in"
244,INTRODUCTION.,"Phocaea, by whose assistance he at length, after some difficulty,"
245,INTRODUCTION.,"reached the little hamlet of Pithys. Here he met with an adventure,"
246,INTRODUCTION.,which we will continue in the words of our author. “Having set out from
247,INTRODUCTION.,"Pithys, Homer went on, attracted by the cries of some goats that were"
248,INTRODUCTION.,"pasturing. The dogs barked on his approach, and he cried out. Glaucus"
249,INTRODUCTION.,"(for that was the name of the goat-herd) heard his voice, ran up"
250,INTRODUCTION.,"quickly, called off his dogs, and drove them away from Homer. For some"
251,INTRODUCTION.,time he stood wondering how a blind man should have reached such a
252,INTRODUCTION.,"place alone, and what could be his design in coming. He then went up to"
253,INTRODUCTION.,"him and inquired who he was, and how he had come to desolate places and"
254,INTRODUCTION.,"untrodden spots, and of what he stood in need. Homer, by recounting to"
255,INTRODUCTION.,"him the whole history of his misfortunes, moved him with compassion;"
256,INTRODUCTION.,"and he took him and led him to his cot, and, having lit a fire, bade"
257,INTRODUCTION.,him sup.
258,INTRODUCTION.,
259,INTRODUCTION.,"“The dogs, instead of eating, kept barking at the stranger, according"
260,INTRODUCTION.,to their usual habit. Whereupon Homer addressed Glaucus thus: O
261,INTRODUCTION.,"Glaucus, my friend, prythee attend to my behest. First give the dogs"
262,INTRODUCTION.,"their supper at the doors of the hut: for so it is better, since,"
263,INTRODUCTION.,"whilst they watch, nor thief nor wild beast will approach the fold."
264,INTRODUCTION.,
265,INTRODUCTION.,“Glaucus was pleased with the advice and marvelled at its author.
266,INTRODUCTION.,"Having finished supper, they banqueted afresh on conversation, Homer"
267,INTRODUCTION.,"narrating his wanderings, and telling of the cities he had visited."
268,INTRODUCTION.,
269,INTRODUCTION.,"“At length they retired to rest; but on the following morning, Glaucus"
270,INTRODUCTION.,"resolved to go to his master, and acquaint him with his meeting with"
271,INTRODUCTION.,"Homer. Having left the goats in charge of a fellow-servant, he left"
272,INTRODUCTION.,"Homer at home, promising to return quickly. Having arrived at Bolissus,"
273,INTRODUCTION.,"a place near the farm, and finding his mate, he told him the whole"
274,INTRODUCTION.,story respecting Homer and his journey. He paid little attention to
275,INTRODUCTION.,"what he said, and blamed Glaucus for his stupidity in taking in and"
276,INTRODUCTION.,"feeding maimed and enfeebled persons. However, he bade him bring the"
277,INTRODUCTION.,stranger to him.
278,INTRODUCTION.,
279,INTRODUCTION.,"“Glaucus told Homer what had taken place, and bade him follow him,"
280,INTRODUCTION.,assuring him that good fortune would be the result. Conversation soon
281,INTRODUCTION.,showed that the stranger was a man of much cleverness and general
282,INTRODUCTION.,"knowledge, and the Chian persuaded him to remain, and to undertake the"
283,INTRODUCTION.,charge of his children.”
284,INTRODUCTION.,
285,INTRODUCTION.,Besides the satisfaction of driving the impostor Thestorides from the
286,INTRODUCTION.,"island, Homer enjoyed considerable success as a teacher. In the town of"
287,INTRODUCTION.,"Chios he established a school, where he taught the precepts of poetry."
288,INTRODUCTION.,"“To this day,” says Chandler, “the most curious remain is that which"
289,INTRODUCTION.,"has been named, without reason, the School of Homer. It is on the"
290,INTRODUCTION.,"coast, at some distance from the city, northward, and appears to have"
291,INTRODUCTION.,"been an open temple of Cybele, formed on the top of a rock. The shape"
292,INTRODUCTION.,"is oval, and in the centre is the image of the goddess, the head and an"
293,INTRODUCTION.,"arm wanting. She is represented, as usual, sitting. The chair has a"
294,INTRODUCTION.,"lion carved on each side, and on the back. The area is bounded by a low"
295,INTRODUCTION.,"rim, or seat, and about five yards over. The whole is hewn out of the"
296,INTRODUCTION.,"mountain, is rude, indistinct, and probably of the most remote"
297,INTRODUCTION.,antiquity.”
298,INTRODUCTION.,
299,INTRODUCTION.,"So successful was this school, that Homer realised a considerable"
300,INTRODUCTION.,"fortune. He married, and had two daughters, one of whom died single,"
301,INTRODUCTION.,the other married a Chian.
302,INTRODUCTION.,
303,INTRODUCTION.,The following passage betrays the same tendency to connect the
304,INTRODUCTION.,"personages of the poems with the history of the poet, which has already"
305,INTRODUCTION.,been mentioned:—
306,INTRODUCTION.,
307,INTRODUCTION.,“In his poetical compositions Homer displays great gratitude towards
308,INTRODUCTION.,"Mentor of Ithaca, in the Odyssey, whose name he has inserted in his"
309,INTRODUCTION.,"poem as the companion of Ulysses, in return for the care taken of him"
310,INTRODUCTION.,when afflicted with blindness. He also testifies his gratitude to
311,INTRODUCTION.,"Phemius, who had given him both sustenance and instruction.”"
312,INTRODUCTION.,
313,INTRODUCTION.,"His celebrity continued to increase, and many persons advised him to"
314,INTRODUCTION.,"visit Greece whither his reputation had now extended. Having, it is"
315,INTRODUCTION.,"said, made some additions to his poems calculated to please the vanity"
316,INTRODUCTION.,"of the Athenians, of whose city he had hitherto made no mention, he set"
317,INTRODUCTION.,"out for Samos. Here, being recognized by a Samian, who had met with him"
318,INTRODUCTION.,"in Chios, he was handsomely received, and invited to join in"
319,INTRODUCTION.,"celebrating the Apaturian festival. He recited some verses, which gave"
320,INTRODUCTION.,"great satisfaction, and by singing the Eiresione at the New Moon"
321,INTRODUCTION.,"festivals, he earned a subsistence, visiting the houses of the rich,"
322,INTRODUCTION.,with whose children he was very popular.
323,INTRODUCTION.,
324,INTRODUCTION.,"In the spring he sailed for Athens, and arrived at the island of Ios,"
325,INTRODUCTION.,"now Ino, where he fell extremely ill, and died. It is said that his"
326,INTRODUCTION.,"death arose from vexation, at not having been able to unravel an enigma"
327,INTRODUCTION.,proposed by some fishermen’s children.
328,INTRODUCTION.,
329,INTRODUCTION.,"Such is, in brief, the substance of the earliest life of Homer we"
330,INTRODUCTION.,"possess, and so broad are the evidences of its historical"
331,INTRODUCTION.,"worthlessness, that it is scarcely necessary to point them out in"
332,INTRODUCTION.,detail. Let us now consider some of the opinions to which a
333,INTRODUCTION.,"persevering, patient, and learned—but by no means consistent—series of"
334,INTRODUCTION.,"investigations has led. In doing so, I profess to bring forward"
335,INTRODUCTION.,"statements, not to vouch for their reasonableness or probability."
336,INTRODUCTION.,
337,INTRODUCTION.,“Homer appeared. The history of this poet and his works is lost in
338,INTRODUCTION.,"doubtful obscurity, as is the history of many of the first minds who"
339,INTRODUCTION.,"have done honour to humanity, because they rose amidst darkness. The"
340,INTRODUCTION.,"majestic stream of his song, blessing and fertilizing, flows like the"
341,INTRODUCTION.,"Nile, through many lands and nations; and, like the sources of the"
342,INTRODUCTION.,"Nile, its fountains will ever remain concealed.”"
343,INTRODUCTION.,
344,INTRODUCTION.,Such are the words in which one of the most judicious German critics
345,INTRODUCTION.,has eloquently described the uncertainty in which the whole of the
346,INTRODUCTION.,Homeric question is involved. With no less truth and feeling he
347,INTRODUCTION.,proceeds:—
348,INTRODUCTION.,
349,INTRODUCTION.,“It seems here of chief importance to expect no more than the nature of
350,INTRODUCTION.,things makes possible. If the period of tradition in history is the
351,INTRODUCTION.,"region of twilight, we should not expect in it perfect light. The"
352,INTRODUCTION.,"creations of genius always seem like miracles, because they are, for"
353,INTRODUCTION.,"the most part, created far out of the reach of observation. If we were"
354,INTRODUCTION.,"in possession of all the historical testimonies, we never could wholly"
355,INTRODUCTION.,"explain the origin of the Iliad and the Odyssey; for their origin, in"
356,INTRODUCTION.,"all essential points, must have remained the secret of the poet.”"
357,INTRODUCTION.,
358,INTRODUCTION.,"From this criticism, which shows as much insight into the depths of"
359,INTRODUCTION.,human nature as into the minute wire-drawings of scholastic
360,INTRODUCTION.,"investigation, let us pass on to the main question at issue. Was Homer"
361,INTRODUCTION.,an individual? or were the Iliad and Odyssey the result of an ingenious
362,INTRODUCTION.,arrangement of fragments by earlier poets?
363,INTRODUCTION.,
364,INTRODUCTION.,Well has Landor remarked: “Some tell us there were twenty Homers; some
365,INTRODUCTION.,deny that there was ever one. It were idle and foolish to shake the
366,INTRODUCTION.,"contents of a vase, in order to let them settle at last. We are"
367,INTRODUCTION.,"perpetually labouring to destroy our delights, our composure, our"
368,INTRODUCTION.,devotion to superior power. Of all the animals on earth we least know
369,INTRODUCTION.,"what is good for us. My opinion is, that what is best for us is our"
370,INTRODUCTION.,admiration of good. No man living venerates Homer more than I do.”
371,INTRODUCTION.,
372,INTRODUCTION.,"But, greatly as we admire the generous enthusiasm which rests contented"
373,INTRODUCTION.,with the poetry on which its best impulses had been nurtured and
374,INTRODUCTION.,"fostered, without seeking to destroy the vividness of first impressions"
375,INTRODUCTION.,"by minute analysis, our editorial office compels us to give some"
376,INTRODUCTION.,attention to the doubts and difficulties with which the Homeric
377,INTRODUCTION.,"question is beset, and to entreat our reader, for a brief period, to"
378,INTRODUCTION.,"prefer his judgment to his imagination, and to condescend to dry"
379,INTRODUCTION.,"details. Before, however, entering into particulars respecting the"
380,INTRODUCTION.,"question of this unity of the Homeric poems, (at least of the Iliad,) I"
381,INTRODUCTION.,must express my sympathy with the sentiments expressed in the following
382,INTRODUCTION.,remarks:—
383,INTRODUCTION.,
384,INTRODUCTION.,“We cannot but think the universal admiration of its unity by the
385,INTRODUCTION.,"better, the poetic age of Greece, almost conclusive testimony to its"
386,INTRODUCTION.,original composition. It was not till the age of the grammarians that
387,INTRODUCTION.,its primitive integrity was called in question; nor is it injustice to
388,INTRODUCTION.,"assert, that the minute and analytical spirit of a grammarian is not"
389,INTRODUCTION.,"the best qualification for the profound feeling, the comprehensive"
390,INTRODUCTION.,conception of an harmonious whole. The most exquisite anatomist may be
391,INTRODUCTION.,no judge of the symmetry of the human frame; and we would take the
392,INTRODUCTION.,opinion of Chantrey or Westmacott on the proportions and general beauty
393,INTRODUCTION.,"of a form, rather than that of Mr. Brodie or Sir Astley Cooper."
394,INTRODUCTION.,
395,INTRODUCTION.,"“There is some truth, though some malicious exaggeration, in the lines"
396,INTRODUCTION.,of Pope:—
397,INTRODUCTION.,
398,INTRODUCTION.,“‘The critic eye—that microscope of wit—
399,INTRODUCTION.,"Sees hairs and pores, examines bit by bit;"

406,INTRODUCTION.,Long was the time which elapsed before any one dreamt of questioning
407,INTRODUCTION.,the unity of the authorship of the Homeric poems. The grave and
408,INTRODUCTION.,"cautious Thucydides quoted without hesitation the Hymn to Apollo, the"
409,INTRODUCTION.,authenticity of which has been already disclaimed by modern critics.
410,INTRODUCTION.,"Longinus, in an oft-quoted passage, merely expressed an opinion"
411,INTRODUCTION.,"touching the comparative inferiority of the Odyssey to the Iliad; and,"
412,INTRODUCTION.,"among a mass of ancient authors, whose very names it would be tedious"
413,INTRODUCTION.,"to detail, no suspicion of the personal non-existence of Homer ever"
414,INTRODUCTION.,"arose. So far, the voice of antiquity seems to be in favour of our"
415,INTRODUCTION.,early ideas on the subject: let us now see what are the discoveries to
416,INTRODUCTION.,which more modern investigations lay claim.
417,INTRODUCTION.,
418,INTRODUCTION.,"At the end of the seventeenth century, doubts had begun to awaken on"
419,INTRODUCTION.,"the subject, and we find Bentley remarking that “Homer wrote a sequel"
420,INTRODUCTION.,"of songs and rhapsodies, to be sung by himself, for small comings and"
421,INTRODUCTION.,"good cheer, at festivals and other days of merriment. These loose songs"
422,INTRODUCTION.,"were not collected together, in the form of an epic poem, till about"
423,INTRODUCTION.,"Peisistratus’ time, about five hundred years after.”"
424,INTRODUCTION.,
425,INTRODUCTION.,Two French writers—Hedelin and Perrault—avowed a similar scepticism on
426,INTRODUCTION.,"the subject; but it is in the “Scienza Nuova” of Battista Vico, that we"
427,INTRODUCTION.,"first meet with the germ of the theory, subsequently defended by Wolf"
428,INTRODUCTION.,"with so much learning and acuteness. Indeed, it is with the Wolfian"
429,INTRODUCTION.,"theory that we have chiefly to deal, and with the following bold"
430,INTRODUCTION.,"hypothesis, which we will detail in the words of Grote:—"
431,INTRODUCTION.,
432,INTRODUCTION.,"“Half a century ago, the acute and valuable Prolegomena of F. A. Wolf,"
433,INTRODUCTION.,"turning to account the Venetian Scholia, which had then been recently"
434,INTRODUCTION.,"published, first opened philosophical discussion as to the history of"
435,INTRODUCTION.,the Homeric text. A considerable part of that dissertation (though by
436,INTRODUCTION.,"no means the whole) is employed in vindicating the position, previously"
437,INTRODUCTION.,"announced by Bentley, amongst others, that the separate constituent"
438,INTRODUCTION.,portions of the Iliad and Odyssey had not been cemented together into
439,INTRODUCTION.,"any compact body and unchangeable order, until the days of"
440,INTRODUCTION.,"Peisistratus, in the sixth century before Christ. As a step towards"
441,INTRODUCTION.,"that conclusion, Wolf maintained that no written copies of either poem"
442,INTRODUCTION.,"could be shown to have existed during the earlier times, to which their"
443,INTRODUCTION.,"composition is referred; and that without writing, neither the perfect"
444,INTRODUCTION.,symmetry of so complicated a work could have been originally conceived
445,INTRODUCTION.,"by any poet, nor, if realized by him, transmitted with assurance to"
446,INTRODUCTION.,"posterity. The absence of easy and convenient writing, such as must be"
447,INTRODUCTION.,"indispensably supposed for long manuscripts, among the early Greeks,"
448,INTRODUCTION.,was thus one of the points in Wolf’s case against the primitive
449,INTRODUCTION.,"integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey. By Nitzsch, and other leading"
450,INTRODUCTION.,"opponents of Wolf, the connection of the one with the other seems to"
451,INTRODUCTION.,have been accepted as he originally put it; and it has been considered
452,INTRODUCTION.,incumbent on those who defended the ancient aggregate character of the
453,INTRODUCTION.,"Iliad and Odyssey, to maintain that they were written poems from the"
454,INTRODUCTION.,beginning.
455,INTRODUCTION.,
456,INTRODUCTION.,"“To me it appears, that the architectonic functions ascribed by Wolf to"
457,INTRODUCTION.,"Peisistratus and his associates, in reference to the Homeric poems, are"
458,INTRODUCTION.,nowise admissible. But much would undoubtedly be gained towards that
459,INTRODUCTION.,"view of the question, if it could be shown, that, in order to"
460,INTRODUCTION.,"controvert it, we were driven to the necessity of admitting long"
461,INTRODUCTION.,"written poems, in the ninth century before the Christian aera. Few"
462,INTRODUCTION.,"things, in my opinion, can be more improbable; and Mr. Payne Knight,"
463,INTRODUCTION.,"opposed as he is to the Wolfian hypothesis, admits this no less than"
464,INTRODUCTION.,"Wolf himself. The traces of writing in Greece, even in the seventh"
465,INTRODUCTION.,"century before the Christian aera, are exceedingly trifling. We have no"
466,INTRODUCTION.,"remaining inscription earlier than the fortieth Olympiad, and the early"
467,INTRODUCTION.,inscriptions are rude and unskilfully executed; nor can we even assure
468,INTRODUCTION.,"ourselves whether Archilochus, Simonides of Amorgus, Kallinus Tyrtaeus,"
469,INTRODUCTION.,"Xanthus, and the other early elegiac and lyric poets, committed their"
470,INTRODUCTION.,"compositions to writing, or at what time the practice of doing so"
471,INTRODUCTION.,became familiar. The first positive ground which authorizes us to
472,INTRODUCTION.,"presume the existence of a manuscript of Homer, is in the famous"
473,INTRODUCTION.,"ordinance of Solon, with regard to the rhapsodies at the Panathenaea:"
474,INTRODUCTION.,"but for what length of time previously manuscripts had existed, we are"
475,INTRODUCTION.,unable to say.
476,INTRODUCTION.,
477,INTRODUCTION.,“Those who maintain the Homeric poems to have been written from the
478,INTRODUCTION.,"beginning, rest their case, not upon positive proofs, nor yet upon the"
479,INTRODUCTION.,existing habits of society with regard to poetry—for they admit
480,INTRODUCTION.,"generally that the Iliad and Odyssey were not read, but recited and"
481,INTRODUCTION.,"heard,—but upon the supposed necessity that there must have been"
482,INTRODUCTION.,manuscripts to ensure the preservation of the poems—the unassisted
483,INTRODUCTION.,memory of reciters being neither sufficient nor trustworthy. But here
484,INTRODUCTION.,we only escape a smaller difficulty by running into a greater; for the
485,INTRODUCTION.,"existence of trained bards, gifted with extraordinary memory, is far"
486,INTRODUCTION.,"less astonishing than that of long manuscripts, in an age essentially"
487,INTRODUCTION.,"non-reading and non-writing, and when even suitable instruments and"
488,INTRODUCTION.,"materials for the process are not obvious. Moreover, there is a strong"
489,INTRODUCTION.,positive reason for believing that the bard was under no necessity of
490,INTRODUCTION.,refreshing his memory by consulting a manuscript; for if such had been
491,INTRODUCTION.,"the fact, blindness would have been a disqualification for the"
492,INTRODUCTION.,"profession, which we know that it was not, as well from the example of"
493,INTRODUCTION.,"Demodokus, in the Odyssey, as from that of the blind bard of Chios, in"
494,INTRODUCTION.,"the Hymn to the Delian Apollo, whom Thucydides, as well as the general"
495,INTRODUCTION.,"tenor of Grecian legend, identifies with Homer himself. The author of"
496,INTRODUCTION.,"that hymn, be he who he may, could never have described a blind man as"
497,INTRODUCTION.,"attaining the utmost perfection in his art, if he had been conscious"
498,INTRODUCTION.,that the memory of the bard was only maintained by constant reference
499,INTRODUCTION.,to the manuscript in his chest.”
500,INTRODUCTION.,
501,INTRODUCTION.,"The loss of the digamma, that _crux_ of critics, that quicksand upon"
502,INTRODUCTION.,"which even the acumen of Bentley was shipwrecked, seems to prove beyond"
503,INTRODUCTION.,"a doubt, that the pronunciation of the Greek language had undergone a"
504,INTRODUCTION.,considerable change. Now it is certainly difficult to suppose that the
505,INTRODUCTION.,"Homeric poems could have suffered by this change, had written copies"
506,INTRODUCTION.,"been preserved. If Chaucer’s poetry, for instance, had not been"
507,INTRODUCTION.,"written, it could only have come down to us in a softened form, more"
508,INTRODUCTION.,"like the effeminate version of Dryden, than the rough, quaint, noble"
509,INTRODUCTION.,original.
510,INTRODUCTION.,
511,INTRODUCTION.,"“At what period,” continues Grote, “these poems, or indeed any other"
512,INTRODUCTION.,"Greek poems, first began to be written, must be matter of conjecture,"
513,INTRODUCTION.,though there is ground for assurance that it was before the time of
514,INTRODUCTION.,"Solon. If, in the absence of evidence, we may venture upon naming any"
515,INTRODUCTION.,"more determinate period, the question at once suggests itself, What"
516,INTRODUCTION.,"were the purposes which, in that state of society, a manuscript at its"
517,INTRODUCTION.,first commencement must have been intended to answer? For whom was a
518,INTRODUCTION.,written Iliad necessary? Not for the rhapsodes; for with them it was
519,INTRODUCTION.,"not only planted in the memory, but also interwoven with the feelings,"
520,INTRODUCTION.,and conceived in conjunction with all those flexions and intonations of
521,INTRODUCTION.,"voice, pauses, and other oral artifices which were required for"
522,INTRODUCTION.,"emphatic delivery, and which the naked manuscript could never"
523,INTRODUCTION.,reproduce. Not for the general public—they were accustomed to receive
524,INTRODUCTION.,"it with its rhapsodic delivery, and with its accompaniments of a solemn"
525,INTRODUCTION.,and crowded festival. The only persons for whom the written Iliad would
526,INTRODUCTION.,be suitable would be a select few; studious and curious men; a class of
527,INTRODUCTION.,readers capable of analyzing the complicated emotions which they had
528,INTRODUCTION.,"experienced as hearers in the crowd, and who would, on perusing the"
529,INTRODUCTION.,"written words, realize in their imaginations a sensible portion of the"
530,INTRODUCTION.,impression communicated by the reciter. Incredible as the statement may
531,INTRODUCTION.,"seem in an age like the present, there is in all early societies, and"
532,INTRODUCTION.,"there was in early Greece, a time when no such reading class existed."
533,INTRODUCTION.,If we could discover at what time such a class first began to be
534,INTRODUCTION.,"formed, we should be able to make a guess at the time when the old epic"
535,INTRODUCTION.,poems were first committed to writing. Now the period which may with
536,INTRODUCTION.,the greatest probability be fixed upon as having first witnessed the
537,INTRODUCTION.,"formation even of the narrowest reading class in Greece, is the middle"
538,INTRODUCTION.,of the seventh century before the Christian aera (B.C. 660 to B.C.
539,INTRODUCTION.,"630), the age of Terpander, Kallinus, Archilochus, Simenides of"
540,INTRODUCTION.,"Amorgus, &c. I ground this supposition on the change then operated in"
541,INTRODUCTION.,the character and tendencies of Grecian poetry and music—the elegiac
542,INTRODUCTION.,and the iambic measures having been introduced as rivals to the
543,INTRODUCTION.,"primitive hexameter, and poetical compositions having been transferred"
544,INTRODUCTION.,from the epical past to the affairs of present and real life. Such a
545,INTRODUCTION.,change was important at a time when poetry was the only known mode of
546,INTRODUCTION.,"publication (to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable, yet the"
547,INTRODUCTION.,nearest approaching to the sense). It argued a new way of looking at
548,INTRODUCTION.,"the old epical treasures of the people, as well as a thirst for new"
549,INTRODUCTION.,poetical effect; and the men who stood forward in it may well be
550,INTRODUCTION.,"considered as desirous to study, and competent to criticize, from their"
551,INTRODUCTION.,"own individual point of view, the written words of the Homeric"
552,INTRODUCTION.,"rhapsodies, just as we are told that Kallinus both noticed and"
553,INTRODUCTION.,"eulogized the Thebais as the production of Homer. There seems,"
554,INTRODUCTION.,"therefore, ground for conjecturing that (for the use of this"
555,INTRODUCTION.,"newly-formed and important, but very narrow class), manuscripts of the"
556,INTRODUCTION.,"Homeric poems and other old epics,—the Thebais and the Cypria, as well"
557,INTRODUCTION.,"as the Iliad and the Odyssey,—began to be compiled towards the middle"
558,INTRODUCTION.,of the seventh century B.C.; and the opening of Egypt to Grecian
559,INTRODUCTION.,"commerce, which took place about the same period, would furnish"
560,INTRODUCTION.,increased facilities for obtaining the requisite papyrus to write upon.
561,INTRODUCTION.,"A reading class, when once formed, would doubtless slowly increase, and"
562,INTRODUCTION.,the number of manuscripts along with it: so that before the time of
563,INTRODUCTION.,"Solon, fifty years afterwards, both readers and manuscripts, though"
564,INTRODUCTION.,"still comparatively few, might have attained a certain recognized"
565,INTRODUCTION.,"authority, and formed a tribunal of reference against the carelessness"
566,INTRODUCTION.,of individual rhapsodies.”
567,INTRODUCTION.,
568,INTRODUCTION.,But even Peisistratus has not been suffered to remain in possession of
569,INTRODUCTION.,"the credit, and we cannot help feeling the force of the following"
570,INTRODUCTION.,observations:—
571,INTRODUCTION.,
572,INTRODUCTION.,"“There are several incidental circumstances which, in our opinion,"
573,INTRODUCTION.,throw some suspicion over the whole history of the Peisistratid
574,INTRODUCTION.,"compilation, at least over the theory that the Iliad was cast into its"
575,INTRODUCTION.,present stately and harmonious form by the directions of the Athenian
576,INTRODUCTION.,"ruler. If the great poets, who flourished at the bright period of"
577,INTRODUCTION.,"Grecian song, of which, alas! we have inherited little more than the"
578,INTRODUCTION.,"fame, and the faint echo; if Stesichorus, Anacreon, and Simonides were"
579,INTRODUCTION.,"employed in the noble task of compiling the Iliad and Odyssey, so much"
580,INTRODUCTION.,"must have been done to arrange, to connect, to harmonize, that it is"
581,INTRODUCTION.,almost incredible that stronger marks of Athenian manufacture should
582,INTRODUCTION.,"not remain. Whatever occasional anomalies may be detected, anomalies"
583,INTRODUCTION.,which no doubt arise out of our own ignorance of the language of the
584,INTRODUCTION.,Homeric age; however the irregular use of the digamma may have
585,INTRODUCTION.,"perplexed our Bentleys, to whom the name of Helen is said to have"
586,INTRODUCTION.,caused as much disquiet and distress as the fair one herself among the
587,INTRODUCTION.,heroes of her age; however Mr. Knight may have failed in reducing the
588,INTRODUCTION.,"Homeric language to its primitive form; however, finally, the Attic"
589,INTRODUCTION.,dialect may not have assumed all its more marked and distinguishing
590,INTRODUCTION.,"characteristics:—still it is difficult to suppose that the language,"
591,INTRODUCTION.,"particularly in the joinings and transitions, and connecting parts,"
592,INTRODUCTION.,should not more clearly betray the incongruity between the more ancient
593,INTRODUCTION.,and modern forms of expression. It is not quite in character with such
594,INTRODUCTION.,"a period to imitate an antique style, in order to piece out an"
595,INTRODUCTION.,"imperfect poem in the character of the original, as Sir Walter Scott"
596,INTRODUCTION.,has done in his continuation of Sir Tristram.
597,INTRODUCTION.,
598,INTRODUCTION.,"“If, however, not even such faint and indistinct traces of Athenian"
599,INTRODUCTION.,"compilation are discoverable in the language of the poems, the total"
600,INTRODUCTION.,absence of Athenian national feeling is perhaps no less worthy of
601,INTRODUCTION.,"observation. In later, and it may fairly be suspected in earlier times,"
602,INTRODUCTION.,the Athenians were more than ordinarily jealous of the fame of their
603,INTRODUCTION.,"ancestors. But, amid all the traditions of the glories of early Greece"
604,INTRODUCTION.,"embodied in the Iliad, the Athenians play a most subordinate and"
605,INTRODUCTION.,insignificant part. Even the few passages which relate to their
606,INTRODUCTION.,"ancestors, Mr. Knight suspects to be interpolations. It is possible,"
607,INTRODUCTION.,"indeed, that in its leading outline, the Iliad may be true to historic"
608,INTRODUCTION.,fact; that in the great maritime expedition of western Greece against
609,INTRODUCTION.,"the rival and half-kindred empire of the Laomedontiadae, the chieftain"
610,INTRODUCTION.,"of Thessaly, from his valour and the number of his forces, may have"
611,INTRODUCTION.,been the most important ally of the Peloponnesian sovereign: the
612,INTRODUCTION.,pre-eminent value of the ancient poetry on the Trojan war may thus have
613,INTRODUCTION.,forced the national feeling of the Athenians to yield to their taste.
614,INTRODUCTION.,"The songs which spoke of their own great ancestor were, no doubt, of"
615,INTRODUCTION.,"far inferior sublimity and popularity, or, at first sight, a Theseid"
616,INTRODUCTION.,would have been much more likely to have emanated from an Athenian
617,INTRODUCTION.,"synod of compilers of ancient song, than an Achilleid or an Odysseid."
618,INTRODUCTION.,"Could France have given birth to a Tasso, Tancred would have been the"
619,INTRODUCTION.,"hero of the Jerusalem. If, however, the Homeric ballads, as they are"
620,INTRODUCTION.,"sometimes called, which related the wrath of Achilles, with all its"
621,INTRODUCTION.,"direful consequences, were so far superior to the rest of the poetic"
622,INTRODUCTION.,"cycle, as to admit no rivalry,—it is still surprising, that throughout"
623,INTRODUCTION.,the whole poem the _callida junctura_ should never betray the
624,INTRODUCTION.,workmanship of an Athenian hand; and that the national spirit of a
625,INTRODUCTION.,"race, who have at a later period not inaptly been compared to our"
626,INTRODUCTION.,"self-admiring neighbours, the French, should submit with lofty"
627,INTRODUCTION.,"self-denial to the almost total exclusion of their own ancestors—or, at"
628,INTRODUCTION.,"least, to the questionable dignity of only having produced a leader"
629,INTRODUCTION.,tolerably skilled in the military tactics of his age.”
630,INTRODUCTION.,
631,INTRODUCTION.,"To return to the Wolfian theory. While it is to be confessed, that"
632,INTRODUCTION.,Wolf’s objections to the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey
633,INTRODUCTION.,"have never been wholly got over, we cannot help discovering that they"
634,INTRODUCTION.,"have failed to enlighten us as to any substantial point, and that the"
635,INTRODUCTION.,"difficulties with which the whole subject is beset, are rather"
636,INTRODUCTION.,"augmented than otherwise, if we admit his hypothesis. Nor is Lachmann’s"
637,INTRODUCTION.,modification of his theory any better. He divides the first twenty-two
638,INTRODUCTION.,"books of the Iliad into sixteen different songs, and treats as"
639,INTRODUCTION.,ridiculous the belief that their amalgamation into one regular poem
640,INTRODUCTION.,belongs to a period earlier than the age of Peisistratus. This as Grote
641,INTRODUCTION.,"observes, “ex-plains the gaps and contradictions in the narrative, but"
642,INTRODUCTION.,"it explains nothing else.” Moreover, we find no contradictions"
643,INTRODUCTION.,"warranting this belief, and the so-called sixteen poets concur in"
644,INTRODUCTION.,getting rid of the following leading men in the first battle after the
645,INTRODUCTION.,"secession of Achilles: Elphenor, chief of the Euboeans; Tlepolemus, of"
646,INTRODUCTION.,"the Rhodians; Pandarus, of the Lycians; Odins, of the Halizonians:"
647,INTRODUCTION.,"Pirous and Acamas, of the Thracians. None of these heroes again make"
648,INTRODUCTION.,"their appearance, and we can but agree with Colonel Mure, that “it"
649,INTRODUCTION.,seems strange that any number of independent poets should have so
650,INTRODUCTION.,harmoniously dispensed with the services of all six in the sequel.” The
651,INTRODUCTION.,"discrepancy, by which Pylaemenes, who is represented as dead in the"
652,INTRODUCTION.,"fifth book, weeps at his son’s funeral in the thirteenth, can only be"
653,INTRODUCTION.,regarded as the result of an interpolation.
654,INTRODUCTION.,
655,INTRODUCTION.,"Grote, although not very distinct in stating his own opinions on the"
656,INTRODUCTION.,"subject, has done much to clearly show the incongruity of the Wolfian"
657,INTRODUCTION.,"theory, and of Lachmann’s modifications, with the character of"
658,INTRODUCTION.,"Peisistratus. But he has also shown, and we think with equal success,"
659,INTRODUCTION.,"that the two questions relative to the primitive unity of these poems,"
660,INTRODUCTION.,"or, supposing that impossible, the unison of these parts by"
661,INTRODUCTION.,"Peisistratus, and not before his time, are essentially distinct. In"
662,INTRODUCTION.,"short, “a man may believe the Iliad to have been put together out of"
663,INTRODUCTION.,"pre-existing songs, without recognising the age of Peisistratus as the"
664,INTRODUCTION.,period of its first compilation.” The friends or literary _employés_ of
665,INTRODUCTION.,"Peisistratus must have found an Iliad that was already ancient, and the"
666,INTRODUCTION.,silence of the Alexandrine critics respecting the Peisistratic
667,INTRODUCTION.,"“recension,” goes far to prove, that, among the numerous manuscripts"
668,INTRODUCTION.,"they examined, this was either wanting, or thought unworthy of"
669,INTRODUCTION.,attention.
670,INTRODUCTION.,
671,INTRODUCTION.,"“Moreover,” he continues, “the whole tenor of the poems themselves"
672,INTRODUCTION.,"confirms what is here remarked. There is nothing, either in the Iliad"
673,INTRODUCTION.,"or Odyssey, which savours of modernism, applying that term to the age"
674,INTRODUCTION.,of Peisistratus—nothing which brings to our view the alterations
675,INTRODUCTION.,"brought about by two centuries, in the Greek language, the coined"
676,INTRODUCTION.,"money, the habits of writing and reading, the despotisms and republican"
677,INTRODUCTION.,"governments, the close military array, the improved construction of"
678,INTRODUCTION.,"ships, the Amphiktyonic convocations, the mutual frequentation of"
679,INTRODUCTION.,"religious festivals, the Oriental and Egyptian veins of religion, &c.,"
680,INTRODUCTION.,"familiar to the latter epoch. These alterations Onomakritus, and the"
681,INTRODUCTION.,"other literary friends of Peisistratus, could hardly have failed to"
682,INTRODUCTION.,"notice, even without design, had they then, for the first time,"
683,INTRODUCTION.,undertaken the task of piecing together many self-existent epics into
684,INTRODUCTION.,"one large aggregate. Everything in the two great Homeric poems, both in"
685,INTRODUCTION.,"substance and in language, belongs to an age two or three centuries"
686,INTRODUCTION.,"earlier than Peisistratus. Indeed, even the interpolations (or those"
687,INTRODUCTION.,"passages which, on the best grounds, are pronounced to be such) betray"
688,INTRODUCTION.,"no trace of the sixth century before Christ, and may well have been"
689,INTRODUCTION.,heard by Archilochus and Kallinus—in some cases even by Arktinus and
690,INTRODUCTION.,"Hesiod—as genuine Homeric matter. As far as the evidences on the case,"
691,INTRODUCTION.,"as well internal as external, enable us to judge, we seem warranted in"
692,INTRODUCTION.,believing that the Iliad and Odyssey were recited substantially as they
693,INTRODUCTION.,now stand (always allowing for partial divergences of text and
694,INTRODUCTION.,"interpolations) in 776 B.C., our first trustworthy mark of Grecian"
695,INTRODUCTION.,"time; and this ancient date, let it be added, as it is the"
696,INTRODUCTION.,"best-authenticated fact, so it is also the most important attribute of"
697,INTRODUCTION.,"the Homeric poems, considered in reference to Grecian history; for they"
698,INTRODUCTION.,thus afford us an insight into the anti-historical character of the
699,INTRODUCTION.,"Greeks, enabling us to trace the subsequent forward march of the"
700,INTRODUCTION.,"nation, and to seize instructive contrasts between their former and"
701,INTRODUCTION.,their later condition.”
702,INTRODUCTION.,
703,INTRODUCTION.,"On the whole, I am inclined to believe, that the labours of"
704,INTRODUCTION.,"Peisistratus were wholly of an editorial character, although I must"
705,INTRODUCTION.,confess that I can lay down nothing respecting the extent of his
706,INTRODUCTION.,"labours. At the same time, so far from believing that the composition"
707,INTRODUCTION.,"or primary arrangement of these poems, in their present form, was the"
708,INTRODUCTION.,"work of Peisistratus, I am rather persuaded that the fine taste and"
709,INTRODUCTION.,"elegant, mind of that Athenian would lead him to preserve an ancient"
710,INTRODUCTION.,"and traditional order of the poems, rather than to patch and"
711,INTRODUCTION.,reconstruct them according to a fanciful hypothesis. I will not repeat
712,INTRODUCTION.,"the many discussions respecting whether the poems were written or not,"
713,INTRODUCTION.,or whether the art of writing was known in the time of their reputed
714,INTRODUCTION.,"author. Suffice it to say, that the more we read, the less satisfied we"
715,INTRODUCTION.,are upon either subject.
716,INTRODUCTION.,
717,INTRODUCTION.,"I cannot, however, help thinking, that the story which attributes the"
718,INTRODUCTION.,"preservation of these poems to Lycurgus, is little else than a version"
719,INTRODUCTION.,"of the same story as that of Peisistratus, while its historical"
720,INTRODUCTION.,probability must be measured by that of many others relating to the
721,INTRODUCTION.,Spartan Confucius.
722,INTRODUCTION.,
723,INTRODUCTION.,"I will conclude this sketch of the Homeric theories with an attempt,"
724,INTRODUCTION.,"made by an ingenious friend, to unite them into something like"
725,INTRODUCTION.,consistency. It is as follows:—
726,INTRODUCTION.,
727,INTRODUCTION.,"“No doubt the common soldiers of that age had, like the common sailors"
728,INTRODUCTION.,"of some fifty years ago, some one qualified to ‘discourse in excellent"
729,INTRODUCTION.,"music’ among them. Many of these, like those of the negroes in the"
730,INTRODUCTION.,"United States, were extemporaneous, and allusive to events passing"
731,INTRODUCTION.,around them. But what was passing around them? The grand events of a
732,INTRODUCTION.,"spirit-stirring war; occurrences likely to impress themselves, as the"
733,INTRODUCTION.,"mystical legends of former times had done, upon their memory; besides"
734,INTRODUCTION.,"which, a retentive memory was deemed a virtue of the first water, and"
735,INTRODUCTION.,"was cultivated accordingly in those ancient times. Ballads at first,"
736,INTRODUCTION.,"and down to the beginning of the war with Troy, were merely"
737,INTRODUCTION.,"recitations, with an intonation. Then followed a species of recitative,"
738,INTRODUCTION.,"probably with an intoned burden. Tune next followed, as it aided the"
739,INTRODUCTION.,memory considerably.
740,INTRODUCTION.,
741,INTRODUCTION.,"“It was at this period, about four hundred years after the war, that a"
742,INTRODUCTION.,"poet flourished of the name of Melesigenes, or Moeonides, but most"
743,INTRODUCTION.,probably the former. He saw that these ballads might be made of great
744,INTRODUCTION.,utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the social position of
745,INTRODUCTION.,"Hellas, and, as a collection, he published these lays connecting them"
746,INTRODUCTION.,"by a tale of his own. This poem now exists, under the title of the"
747,INTRODUCTION.,"‘Odyssea.’ The author, however, did not affix his own name to the poem,"
748,INTRODUCTION.,"which, in fact, was, great part of it, remodelled from the archaic"
749,INTRODUCTION.,"dialect of Crete, in which tongue the ballads were found by him. He"
750,INTRODUCTION.,"therefore called it the poem of Homeros, or the Collector; but this is"
751,INTRODUCTION.,"rather a proof of his modesty and talent, than of his mere drudging"
752,INTRODUCTION.,"arrangement of other people’s ideas; for, as Grote has finely observed,"
753,INTRODUCTION.,"arguing for the unity of authorship, ‘a great poet might have re-cast"
754,INTRODUCTION.,pre-existing separate songs into one comprehensive whole; but no mere
755,INTRODUCTION.,arrangers or compilers would be competent to do so.’
756,INTRODUCTION.,
757,INTRODUCTION.,"“While employed on the wild legend of Odysseus, he met with a ballad,"
758,INTRODUCTION.,recording the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon. His noble mind seized
759,INTRODUCTION.,"the hint that there presented itself, and the Achilleis grew under his"
760,INTRODUCTION.,"hand. Unity of design, however, caused him to publish the poem under"
761,INTRODUCTION.,the same pseudonyme as his former work; and the disjointed lays of the
762,INTRODUCTION.,"ancient bards were joined together, like those relating to the Cid,"
763,INTRODUCTION.,"into a chronicle history, named the Iliad. Melesigenes knew that the"
764,INTRODUCTION.,"poem was destined to be a lasting one, and so it has proved; but,"
765,INTRODUCTION.,"first, the poems were destined to undergo many vicissitudes and"
766,INTRODUCTION.,"corruptions, by the people who took to singing them in the streets,"
767,INTRODUCTION.,"assemblies, and agoras. However, Solon first, and then Peisistratus,"
768,INTRODUCTION.,"and afterwards Aristoteles and others, revised the poems, and restored"
769,INTRODUCTION.,the works of Melesigenes Homeros to their original integrity in a great
770,INTRODUCTION.,measure.”
771,INTRODUCTION.,
772,INTRODUCTION.,Having thus given some general notion of the strange theories which
773,INTRODUCTION.,"have developed themselves respecting this most interesting subject, I"
774,INTRODUCTION.,must still express my conviction as to the unity of the authorship of
775,INTRODUCTION.,the Homeric poems. To deny that many corruptions and interpolations
776,INTRODUCTION.,"disfigure them, and that the intrusive hand of the poetasters may here"
777,INTRODUCTION.,and there have inflicted a wound more serious than the negligence of
778,INTRODUCTION.,"the copyist, would be an absurd and captious assumption; but it is to a"
779,INTRODUCTION.,"higher criticism that we must appeal, if we would either understand or"
780,INTRODUCTION.,enjoy these poems. In maintaining the authenticity and personality of
781,INTRODUCTION.,"their one author, be he Homer or Melesigenes, _quocunque nomine vocari"
782,INTRODUCTION.,"eum jus fasque sit_, I feel conscious that, while the whole weight of"
783,INTRODUCTION.,historical evidence is against the hypothesis which would assign these
784,INTRODUCTION.,"great works to a plurality of authors, the most powerful internal"
785,INTRODUCTION.,"evidence, and that which springs from the deepest and most immediate"
786,INTRODUCTION.,"impulse of the soul, also speaks eloquently to the contrary."
787,INTRODUCTION.,
788,INTRODUCTION.,The minutiae of verbal criticism I am far from seeking to despise.
789,INTRODUCTION.,"Indeed, considering the character of some of my own books, such an"
790,INTRODUCTION.,"attempt would be gross inconsistency. But, while I appreciate its"
791,INTRODUCTION.,"importance in a philological view, I am inclined to set little store on"
792,INTRODUCTION.,"its aesthetic value, especially in poetry. Three parts of the"
793,INTRODUCTION.,"emendations made upon poets are mere alterations, some of which, had"
794,INTRODUCTION.,"they been suggested to the author by his Maecenas or Africanus, he"
795,INTRODUCTION.,"would probably have adopted. Moreover, those who are most exact in"
796,INTRODUCTION.,"laying down rules of verbal criticism and interpretation, are often"
797,INTRODUCTION.,least competent to carry out their own precepts. Grammarians are not
798,INTRODUCTION.,"poets by profession, but may be so _per accidens_. I do not at this"
799,INTRODUCTION.,"moment remember two emendations on Homer, calculated to substantially"
800,INTRODUCTION.,"improve the poetry of a passage, although a mass of remarks, from"
801,INTRODUCTION.,"Herodotus down to Loewe, have given us the history of a thousand minute"
802,INTRODUCTION.,"points, without which our Greek knowledge would be gloomy and jejune."
803,INTRODUCTION.,
804,INTRODUCTION.,"But it is not on words only that grammarians, mere grammarians, will"
805,INTRODUCTION.,exercise their elaborate and often tiresome ingenuity. Binding down an
806,INTRODUCTION.,heroic or dramatic poet to the block upon which they have previously
807,INTRODUCTION.,"dissected his words and sentences, they proceed to use the axe and the"
808,INTRODUCTION.,"pruning knife by wholesale; and, inconsistent in everything but their"
809,INTRODUCTION.,"wish to make out a case of unlawful affiliation, they cut out book"
810,INTRODUCTION.,"after book, passage after passage, till the author is reduced to a"
811,INTRODUCTION.,"collection of fragments, or till those who fancied they possessed the"
812,INTRODUCTION.,"works of some great man, find that they have been put off with a vile"
813,INTRODUCTION.,counterfeit got up at second hand. If we compare the theories of
814,INTRODUCTION.,"Knight, Wolf, Lachmann; and others, we shall feel better satisfied of"
815,INTRODUCTION.,the utter uncertainty of criticism than of the apocryphal position of
816,INTRODUCTION.,Homer. One rejects what another considers the turning-point of his
817,INTRODUCTION.,theory. One cuts a supposed knot by expunging what another would
818,INTRODUCTION.,explain by omitting something else.
819,INTRODUCTION.,
820,INTRODUCTION.,Nor is this morbid species of sagacity by any means to be looked upon
821,INTRODUCTION.,"as a literary novelty. Justus Lipsius, a scholar of no ordinary skill,"
822,INTRODUCTION.,"seems to revel in the imaginary discovery, that the tragedies"
823,INTRODUCTION.,"attributed to Seneca are by _four_ different authors. Now, I will"
824,INTRODUCTION.,"venture to assert, that these tragedies are so uniform, not only in"
825,INTRODUCTION.,their borrowed phraseology—a phraseology with which writers like
826,INTRODUCTION.,Boethius and Saxo Grammaticus were more charmed than ourselves—in their
827,INTRODUCTION.,"freedom from real poetry, and last, but not least, in an ultra-refined"
828,INTRODUCTION.,"and consistent abandonment of good taste, that few writers of the"
829,INTRODUCTION.,"present day would question the capabilities of the same gentleman, be"
830,INTRODUCTION.,"he Seneca or not, to produce not only these, but a great many more"
831,INTRODUCTION.,"equally bad. With equal sagacity, Father Hardouin astonished the world"
832,INTRODUCTION.,"with the startling announcement that the AEneid of Virgil, and the"
833,INTRODUCTION.,"satires of Horace, were literary deceptions. Now, without wishing to"
834,INTRODUCTION.,"say one word of disrespect against the industry and learning—nay, the"
835,INTRODUCTION.,refined acuteness—which scholars like Wolf have bestowed upon this
836,INTRODUCTION.,"subject, I must express my fears, that many of our modern Homeric"
837,INTRODUCTION.,"theories will become matter for the surprise and entertainment, rather"
838,INTRODUCTION.,"than the instruction, of posterity. Nor can I help thinking that the"
839,INTRODUCTION.,literary history of more recent times will account for many points of
840,INTRODUCTION.,difficulty in the transmission of the Iliad and Odyssey to a period so
841,INTRODUCTION.,remote from that of their first creation.
842,INTRODUCTION.,
843,INTRODUCTION.,I have already expressed my belief that the labours of Peisistratus
844,INTRODUCTION.,were of a purely editorial character; and there seems no more reason
845,INTRODUCTION.,why corrupt and imperfect editions of Homer may not have been abroad in
846,INTRODUCTION.,"his day, than that the poems of Valerius Flaccus and Tibullus should"
847,INTRODUCTION.,"have given so much trouble to Poggio, Scaliger, and others. But, after"
848,INTRODUCTION.,"all, the main fault in all the Homeric theories is, that they demand"
849,INTRODUCTION.,too great a sacrifice of those feelings to which poetry most powerfully
850,INTRODUCTION.,"appeals, and which are its most fitting judges. The ingenuity which has"
851,INTRODUCTION.,"sought to rob us of the name and existence of Homer, does too much"
852,INTRODUCTION.,"violence to that inward emotion, which makes our whole soul yearn with"
853,INTRODUCTION.,love and admiration for the blind bard of Chios. To believe the author
854,INTRODUCTION.,"of the Iliad a mere compiler, is to degrade the powers of human"
855,INTRODUCTION.,invention; to elevate analytical judgment at the expense of the most
856,INTRODUCTION.,ennobling impulses of the soul; and to forget the ocean in the
857,INTRODUCTION.,"contemplation of a polypus. There is a catholicity, so to speak, in the"
858,INTRODUCTION.,very name of Homer. Our faith in the author of the Iliad may be a
859,INTRODUCTION.,"mistaken one, but as yet nobody has taught us a better."
860,INTRODUCTION.,
861,INTRODUCTION.,"While, however, I look upon the belief in Homer as one that has nature"
862,INTRODUCTION.,herself for its mainspring; while I can join with old Ennius in
863,INTRODUCTION.,"believing in Homer as the ghost, who, like some patron saint, hovers"
864,INTRODUCTION.,"round the bed of the poet, and even bestows rare gifts from that wealth"
865,INTRODUCTION.,"of imagination which a host of imitators could not exhaust,—still I am"
866,INTRODUCTION.,far from wishing to deny that the author of these great poems found a
867,INTRODUCTION.,"rich fund of tradition, a well-stocked mythical storehouse, from whence"
868,INTRODUCTION.,he might derive both subject and embellishment. But it is one thing to
869,INTRODUCTION.,"_use_ existing romances in the embellishment of a poem, another to"
870,INTRODUCTION.,patch up the poem itself from such materials. What consistency of style
871,INTRODUCTION.,"and execution can be hoped for from such an attempt? or, rather, what"
872,INTRODUCTION.,bad taste and tedium will not be the infallible result?
873,INTRODUCTION.,
874,INTRODUCTION.,"A blending of popular legends, and a free use of the songs of other"
875,INTRODUCTION.,"bards, are features perfectly consistent with poetical originality. In"
876,INTRODUCTION.,"fact, the most original writer is still drawing upon outward"
877,INTRODUCTION.,"impressions—nay, even his own thoughts are a kind of secondary agents"
878,INTRODUCTION.,which support and feed the impulses of imagination. But unless there be
879,INTRODUCTION.,"some grand pervading principle—some invisible, yet most distinctly"
880,INTRODUCTION.,"stamped archetypus of the great whole, a poem like the Iliad can never"
881,INTRODUCTION.,"come to the birth. Traditions the most picturesque, episodes the most"
882,INTRODUCTION.,"pathetic, local associations teeming with the thoughts of gods and"
883,INTRODUCTION.,"great men, may crowd in one mighty vision, or reveal themselves in more"
884,INTRODUCTION.,"substantial forms to the mind of the poet; but, except the power to"
885,INTRODUCTION.,"create a grand whole, to which these shall be but as details and"
886,INTRODUCTION.,"embellishments, be present, we shall have nought but a scrap-book, a"
887,INTRODUCTION.,parterre filled with flowers and weeds strangling each other in their
888,INTRODUCTION.,"wild redundancy; we shall have a cento of rags and tatters, which will"
889,INTRODUCTION.,require little acuteness to detect.
890,INTRODUCTION.,
891,INTRODUCTION.,"Sensible as I am of the difficulty of disproving a negative, and aware"
892,INTRODUCTION.,"as I must be of the weighty grounds there are for opposing my belief,"
893,INTRODUCTION.,it still seems to me that the Homeric question is one that is reserved
894,INTRODUCTION.,for a higher criticism than it has often obtained. We are not by nature
895,INTRODUCTION.,"intended to know all things; still less, to compass the powers by which"
896,INTRODUCTION.,the greatest blessings of life have been placed at our disposal. Were
897,INTRODUCTION.,"faith no virtue, then we might indeed wonder why God willed our"
898,INTRODUCTION.,ignorance on any matter. But we are too well taught the contrary
899,INTRODUCTION.,"lesson; and it seems as though our faith should be especially tried,"
900,INTRODUCTION.,touching the men and the events which have wrought most influence upon
901,INTRODUCTION.,the condition of humanity. And there is a kind of sacredness attached
902,INTRODUCTION.,"to the memory of the great and the good, which seems to bid us repulse"
903,INTRODUCTION.,the scepticism which would allegorize their existence into a pleasing
904,INTRODUCTION.,"apologue, and measure the giants of intellect by an homaeopathic"
905,INTRODUCTION.,dynameter.
906,INTRODUCTION.,
907,INTRODUCTION.,Long and habitual reading of Homer appears to familiarize our thoughts
908,INTRODUCTION.,"even to his incongruities; or rather, if we read in a right spirit and"
909,INTRODUCTION.,"with a heartfelt appreciation, we are too much dazzled, too deeply"
910,INTRODUCTION.,"wrapped in admiration of the whole, to dwell upon the minute spots"
911,INTRODUCTION.,"which mere analysis can discover. In reading an heroic poem, we must"
912,INTRODUCTION.,"transform ourselves into heroes of the time being, we in imagination"
913,INTRODUCTION.,"must fight over the same battles, woo the same loves, burn with the"
914,INTRODUCTION.,"same sense of injury, as an Achilles or a Hector. And if we can but"
915,INTRODUCTION.,attain this degree of enthusiasm (and less enthusiasm will scarcely
916,INTRODUCTION.,"suffice for the reading of Homer), we shall feel that the poems of"
917,INTRODUCTION.,"Homer are not only the work of one writer, but of the greatest writer"
918,INTRODUCTION.,that ever touched the hearts of men by the power of song.
919,INTRODUCTION.,
920,INTRODUCTION.,And it was this supposed unity of authorship which gave these poems
921,INTRODUCTION.,"their powerful influence over the minds of the men of old. Heeren, who"
922,INTRODUCTION.,"is evidently little disposed in favour of modern theories, finely"
923,INTRODUCTION.,observes:—
924,INTRODUCTION.,
925,INTRODUCTION.,“It was Homer who formed the character of the Greek nation. No poet has
926,INTRODUCTION.,"ever, as a poet, exercised a similar influence over his countrymen."
927,INTRODUCTION.,"Prophets, lawgivers, and sages have formed the character of other"
928,INTRODUCTION.,nations; it was reserved to a poet to form that of the Greeks. This is
929,INTRODUCTION.,a feature in their character which was not wholly erased even in the
930,INTRODUCTION.,period of their degeneracy. When lawgivers and sages appeared in
931,INTRODUCTION.,"Greece, the work of the poet had already been accomplished; and they"
932,INTRODUCTION.,paid homage to his superior genius. He held up before his nation the
933,INTRODUCTION.,"mirror in which they were to behold the world of gods and heroes, no"
934,INTRODUCTION.,"less than of feeble mortals, and to behold them reflected with purity"
935,INTRODUCTION.,and truth. His poems are founded on the first feeling of human nature;
936,INTRODUCTION.,"on the love of children, wife, and country; on that passion which"
937,INTRODUCTION.,"outweighs all others, the love of glory. His songs were poured forth"
938,INTRODUCTION.,from a breast which sympathized with all the feelings of man; and
939,INTRODUCTION.,"therefore they enter, and will continue to enter, every breast which"
940,INTRODUCTION.,"cherishes the same sympathies. If it is granted to his immortal spirit,"
941,INTRODUCTION.,"from another heaven than any of which he dreamed on earth, to look down"
942,INTRODUCTION.,"on his race, to see the nations from the fields of Asia, to the forests"
943,INTRODUCTION.,"of Hercynia, performing pilgrimages to the fountain which his magic"
944,INTRODUCTION.,wand caused to flow; if it is permitted to him to view the vast
945,INTRODUCTION.,"assemblage of grand, of elevated, of glorious productions, which had"
946,INTRODUCTION.,been called into being by means of his songs; wherever his immortal
947,INTRODUCTION.,"spirit may reside, this alone would suffice to complete his happiness.”"
948,INTRODUCTION.,
949,INTRODUCTION.,"Can we contemplate that ancient monument, on which the “Apotheosis of"
950,INTRODUCTION.,"Homer” is depictured, and not feel how much of pleasing association,"
951,INTRODUCTION.,"how much that appeals most forcibly and most distinctly to our minds,"
952,INTRODUCTION.,is lost by the admittance of any theory but our old tradition? The more
953,INTRODUCTION.,"we read, and the more we think—think as becomes the readers of"
954,INTRODUCTION.,"Homer,—the more rooted becomes the conviction that the Father of Poetry"
955,INTRODUCTION.,"gave us this rich inheritance, whole and entire. Whatever were the"
956,INTRODUCTION.,"means of its preservation, let us rather be thankful for the treasury"
957,INTRODUCTION.,"of taste and eloquence thus laid open to our use, than seek to make it"
958,INTRODUCTION.,"a mere centre around which to drive a series of theories, whose"
959,INTRODUCTION.,wildness is only equalled by their inconsistency with each other.
960,INTRODUCTION.,
961,INTRODUCTION.,"As the hymns, and some other poems usually ascribed to Homer, are not"
962,INTRODUCTION.,"included in Pope’s translation, I will content myself with a brief"
963,INTRODUCTION.,"account of the Battle of the Frogs and Mice, from the pen of a writer"
964,INTRODUCTION.,who has done it full justice:—
965,INTRODUCTION.,
966,INTRODUCTION.,"“This poem,” says Coleridge, “is a short mock-heroic of ancient date."
967,INTRODUCTION.,"The text varies in different editions, and is obviously disturbed and"
968,INTRODUCTION.,corrupt to a great degree; it is commonly said to have been a juvenile
969,INTRODUCTION.,essay of Homer’s genius; others have attributed it to the same Pigrees
970,INTRODUCTION.,"mentioned above, and whose reputation for humour seems to have invited"
971,INTRODUCTION.,"the appropriation of any piece of ancient wit, the author of which was"
972,INTRODUCTION.,"uncertain; so little did the Greeks, before the age of the Ptolemies,"
973,INTRODUCTION.,know or care about that department of criticism employed in determining
974,INTRODUCTION.,the genuineness of ancient writings. As to this little poem being a
975,INTRODUCTION.,"youthful prolusion of Homer, it seems sufficient to say that from the"
976,INTRODUCTION.,"beginning to the end, it is a plain and palpable parody, not only of"
977,INTRODUCTION.,"the general spirit, but of numerous passages of the Iliad itself; and,"
978,INTRODUCTION.,"even if no such intention to parody were discernible in it, the"
979,INTRODUCTION.,"objection would still remain, that to suppose a work of mere burlesque"
980,INTRODUCTION.,"to be the primary effort of poetry in a simple age, seems to reverse"
981,INTRODUCTION.,"that order in the development of national taste, which the history of"
982,INTRODUCTION.,"every other people in Europe, and of many in Asia, has almost"
983,INTRODUCTION.,ascertained to be a law of the human mind; it is in a state of society
984,INTRODUCTION.,"much more refined and permanent than that described in the Iliad, that"
985,INTRODUCTION.,any popularity would attend such a ridicule of war and the gods as is
986,INTRODUCTION.,contained in this poem; and the fact of there having existed three
987,INTRODUCTION.,"other poems of the same kind attributed, for aught we can see, with as"
988,INTRODUCTION.,"much reason to Homer, is a strong inducement to believe that none of"
989,INTRODUCTION.,them were of the Homeric age. Knight infers from the usage of the word
990,INTRODUCTION.,"δὲλτος, ‘writing tablet,’ instead of διφθέρα, ‘skin,’ which, according"
991,INTRODUCTION.,"to Herod 5, 58, was the material employed by the Asiatic Greeks for"
992,INTRODUCTION.,"that purpose, that this poem was another offspring of Attic ingenuity;"
993,INTRODUCTION.,and generally that the familiar mention of the cock (v. 191) is a
994,INTRODUCTION.,strong argument against so ancient a date for its composition.”
995,INTRODUCTION.,
996,INTRODUCTION.,Having thus given a brief account of the poems comprised in Pope’s
997,INTRODUCTION.,"design, I will now proceed to make a few remarks on his translation,"
998,INTRODUCTION.,and on my own purpose in the present edition.
999,INTRODUCTION.,
1000,INTRODUCTION.,"Pope was not a Grecian. His whole education had been irregular, and his"
1001,INTRODUCTION.,earliest acquaintance with the poet was through the version of Ogilby.
1002,INTRODUCTION.,It is not too much to say that his whole work bears the impress of a
1003,INTRODUCTION.,"disposition to be satisfied with the general sense, rather than to dive"
1004,INTRODUCTION.,deeply into the minute and delicate features of language. Hence his
1005,INTRODUCTION.,whole work is to be looked upon rather as an elegant paraphrase than a
1006,INTRODUCTION.,"translation. There are, to be sure, certain conventional anecdotes,"
1007,INTRODUCTION.,"which prove that Pope consulted various friends, whose classical"
1008,INTRODUCTION.,"attainments were sounder than his own, during the undertaking; but it"
1009,INTRODUCTION.,is probable that these examinations were the result rather of the
1010,INTRODUCTION.,"contradictory versions already existing, than of a desire to make a"
1011,INTRODUCTION.,"perfect transcript of the original. And in those days, what is called"
1012,INTRODUCTION.,literal translation was less cultivated than at present. If something
1013,INTRODUCTION.,like the general sense could be decorated with the easy gracefulness of
1014,INTRODUCTION.,a practised poet; if the charms of metrical cadence and a pleasing
1015,INTRODUCTION.,fluency could be made consistent with a fair interpretation of the
1016,INTRODUCTION.,"poet’s meaning, his words were less jealously sought for, and those who"
1017,INTRODUCTION.,could read so good a poem as Pope’s Iliad had fair reason to be
1018,INTRODUCTION.,satisfied.
1019,INTRODUCTION.,
1020,INTRODUCTION.,"It would be absurd, therefore, to test Pope’s translation by our own"
1021,INTRODUCTION.,advancing knowledge of the original text. We must be content to look at
1022,INTRODUCTION.,"it as a most delightful work in itself,—a work which is as much a part"
1023,INTRODUCTION.,of English literature as Homer himself is of Greek. We must not be torn
1024,INTRODUCTION.,"from our kindly associations with the old Iliad, that once was our most"
1025,INTRODUCTION.,"cherished companion, or our most looked-for prize, merely because"
1026,INTRODUCTION.,"Buttmann, Loewe, and Liddell have made us so much more accurate as to"
1027,INTRODUCTION.,"ἀμφικύπελλον being an adjective, and not a substantive. Far be it from"
1028,INTRODUCTION.,"us to defend the faults of Pope, especially when we think of Chapman’s"
1029,INTRODUCTION.,"fine, bold, rough old English;—far be it from us to hold up his"
1030,INTRODUCTION.,translation as what a translation of Homer _might_ be. But we can still
1031,INTRODUCTION.,"dismiss Pope’s Iliad to the hands of our readers, with the"
1032,INTRODUCTION.,consciousness that they must have read a very great number of books
1033,INTRODUCTION.,before they have read its fellow.

1665,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,
1666,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,Telemachus in the assembly of the lords of Ithaca complains of the
1667,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"injustice done him by the suitors, and insists upon their departure"
1668,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"from his palace; appealing to the princes, and exciting the people to"
1669,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"declare against them. The suitors endeavour to justify their stay, at"
1670,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,least till he shall send the queen to the court of Icarius her father;
1671,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"which he refuses. There appears a prodigy of two eagles in the sky,"
1672,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,which an augur expounds to the ruin of the suitors. Telemachus then
1673,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"demands a vessel to carry him to Pylos and Sparta, there to inquire of"
1674,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"his father’s fortunes. Pallas, in the shape of Mentor (an ancient"
1675,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"friend of Ulysses), helps him to a ship, assists him in preparing"
1676,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"necessaries for the voyage, and embarks with him that night; which"
1677,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,concludes the second day from the opening of the poem. The scene
1678,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"continues in the palace of Ulysses, in Ithaca."
1679,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,
1680,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,
1681,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Now reddening from the dawn, the morning ray"
1682,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Glow’d in the front of heaven, and gave the day"
1683,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"The youthful hero, with returning light,"
1684,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,Rose anxious from the inquietudes of night.
1685,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"A royal robe he wore with graceful pride,"
1686,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"A two-edged falchion threaten’d by his side,"
1687,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Embroider’d sandals glitter’d as he trod,"
1688,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"And forth he moved, majestic as a god."
1689,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Then by his heralds, restless of delay,"
1690,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,To council calls the peers: the peers obey.
1691,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Soon as in solemn form the assembly sate,"
1692,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,From his high dome himself descends in state.
1693,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,Bright in his hand a ponderous javelin shined;
1694,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Two dogs, a faithful guard, attend behind;"
1695,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Pallas with grace divine his form improves,"
1696,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"And gazing crowds admire him as he moves,"
1697,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,
1698,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,His father’s throne he fill’d; while distant stood
1699,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"The hoary peers, and aged wisdom bow’d."
1700,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,
1701,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,’Twas silence all. At last AEgyptius spoke;
1702,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"AEgyptius, by his age and sorrow broke;"
1703,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"A length of days his soul with prudence crown’d,"
1704,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,A length of days had bent him to the ground.
1705,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"His eldest hope in arms to Ilion came,"
1706,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,By great Ulysses taught the path to fame;
1707,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,But (hapless youth) the hideous Cyclops tore
1708,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"His quivering limbs, and quaff’d his spouting gore."
1709,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,Three sons remain’d; to climb with haughty fires
1710,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"The royal bed, Eurynomus aspires;"
1711,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"The rest with duteous love his griefs assuage,"
1712,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,And ease the sire of half the cares of age.
1713,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Yet still his Antiphus he loves, he mourns,"
1714,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"And, as he stood, he spoke and wept by turns,"

1716,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"“Since great Ulysses sought the Phrygian plains,"
1717,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,Within these walls inglorious silence reigns.
1718,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Say then, ye peers! by whose commands we meet?"
1719,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,Why here once more in solemn council sit?
1720,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Ye young, ye old, the weighty cause disclose:"
1721,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,Arrives some message of invading foes?
1722,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Or say, does high necessity of state"
1723,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Inspire some patriot, and demand debate?"
1724,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,The present synod speaks its author wise;
1725,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Assist him, Jove, thou regent of the skies!”"
1726,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,
1727,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"He spoke. Telemachus with transport glows,"
1728,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Embraced the omen, and majestic rose"
1729,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,(His royal hand the imperial sceptre sway’d);
1730,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Then thus, addressing to AEgyptius, said:"
1731,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,
1732,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,“Reverend old man! lo here confess’d he stands
1733,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,By whom ye meet; my grief your care demands.
1734,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"No story I unfold of public woes,"
1735,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,Nor bear advices of impending foes:
1736,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Peace the blest land, and joys incessant crown:"
1737,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Of all this happy realm, I grieve alone."
1738,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"For my lost sire continual sorrows spring,"
1739,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"The great, the good; your father and your king."
1740,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Yet more; our house from its foundation bows,"
1741,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Our foes are powerful, and your sons the foes;"
1742,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Hither, unwelcome to the queen, they come;"
1743,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,Why seek they not the rich Icarian dome?
1744,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"If she must wed, from other hands require"
1745,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,The dowry: is Telemachus her sire?
1746,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Yet through my court the noise of revel rings,"
1747,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,And waste the wise frugality of kings.
1748,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,Scarce all my herds their luxury suffice;
1749,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,Scarce all my wine their midnight hours supplies.
1750,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Safe in my youth, in riot still they grow,"
1751,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,Nor in the helpless orphan dread a foe.
1752,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"But come it will, the time when manhood grants"
1753,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,More powerful advocates than vain complaints.
1754,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,Approach that hour! insufferable wrong
1755,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Cries to the gods, and vengeance sleeps too long."
1756,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Rise then, ye peers! with virtuous anger rise;"
1757,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Your fame revere, but most the avenging skies."
1758,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"By all the deathless powers that reign above,"
1759,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,By righteous Themis and by thundering Jove
1760,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"(Themis, who gives to councils, or denies"
1761,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Success; and humbles, or confirms the wise),"
1762,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,Rise in my aid! suffice the tears that flow
1763,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"For my lost sire, nor add new woe to woe."
1764,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"If e’er he bore the sword to strengthen ill,"
1765,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Or, having power to wrong, betray’d the will,"
1766,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"On me, on me your kindled wrath assuage,"
1767,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,And bid the voice of lawless riot rage.
1768,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"If ruin to your royal race ye doom,"
1769,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Be you the spoilers, and our wealth consume."
1770,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Then might we hope redress from juster laws,"
1771,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,And raise all Ithaca to aid our cause:
1772,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"But while your sons commit the unpunish’d wrong,"
1773,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,You make the arm of violence too strong.”
1774,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,
1775,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"While thus he spoke, with rage and grief he frown’d,"
1776,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,And dash’d the imperial sceptre to the ground.
1777,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,The big round tear hung trembling in his eye:
1778,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"The synod grieved, and gave a pitying sigh,"
1779,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,Then silent sate—at length Antinous burns
1780,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"With haughty rage, and sternly thus returns:"
1781,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,
1782,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,“O insolence of youth! whose tongue affords
1783,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Such railing eloquence, and war of words."
1784,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Studious thy country’s worthies to defame,"
1785,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,Thy erring voice displays thy mother’s shame.
1786,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Elusive of the bridal day, she gives"
1787,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Fond hopes to all, and all with hopes deceives."

1790,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"While she, laborious in delusion, spread"
1791,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"The spacious loom, and mix’d the various thread:"
1792,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Where as to life the wondrous figures rise,"

1794,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,
1795,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"“Though cold in death Ulysses breathes no more,"

1804,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"“Thus she: at once the generous train complies,"
1805,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,Nor fraud mistrusts in virtue’s fair disguise.
1806,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"The work she plied; but, studious of delay,"
1807,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,By night reversed the labours of the day.
1808,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"While thrice the sun his annual journey made,"

1812,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"We saw, as unperceived we took our stand,"
1813,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,The backward labours of her faithless hand.
1814,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,"Then urged, she perfects her illustrious toils;"
1815,THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA.,A wondrous monument of female wiles!

3872,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,He thus: “O were the woes you speak the worst!
3873,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,They form a deed more odious and accursed;
3874,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,More dreadful than your boding soul divines;
3875,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,But pitying Jove avert the dire designs!
3876,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,The darling object of your royal care
3877,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,Is marked to perish in a deathful snare;
3878,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Before he anchors in his native port,"
3879,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,From Pyle re-sailing and the Spartan court;
3880,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,Horrid to speak! in ambush is decreed
3881,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,The hope and heir of Ithaca to bleed!”
3882,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,
3883,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Sudden she sunk beneath the weighty woes,"
3884,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,The vital streams a chilling horror froze;
3885,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"The big round tear stands trembling in her eye,"
3886,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,And on her tongue imperfect accents die.
3887,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,At length in tender language interwove
3888,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"With sighs, she thus expressed her anxious love;"
3889,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"“Why rarely would my son his fate explore,"
3890,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Ride the wild waves, and quit the safer shore?"
3891,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Did he with all the greatly wretched, crave"
3892,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"A blank oblivion, and untimely grave?”"
3893,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,
3894,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,“Tis not (replied the sage) to Medon given
3895,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"To know, if some inhabitant of heaven"
3896,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,In his young breast the daring thought inspired
3897,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Or if, alone with filial duty fired,"
3898,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"The winds and waves he tempts in early bloom,"
3899,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,Studious to learn his absent father’s doom.”
3900,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,
3901,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,The sage retired: unable to control
3902,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,The mighty griefs that swell her labouring soul
3903,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,Rolling convulsive on the floor is seen
3904,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,The piteous object of a prostrate queen.
3905,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Words to her dumb complaint a pause supplies,"
3906,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"And breath, to waste in unavailing cries."
3907,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Around their sovereign wept the menial fair,"
3908,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,To whom she thus address’d her deep despair:
3909,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,
3910,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,“Behold a wretch whom all the gods consign
3911,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,To woe! Did ever sorrows equal mine?
3912,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Long to my joys my dearest lord is lost,"
3913,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"His country’s buckler, and the Grecian boast;"
3914,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Now from my fond embrace, by tempests torn,"
3915,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,Our other column of the state is borne;
3916,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Nor took a kind adieu, nor sought consent!—"
3917,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,Unkind confederates in his dire intent!
3918,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Ill suits it with your shows of duteous zeal,"
3919,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,From me the purposed voyage to conceal;
3920,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Though at the solemn midnight hour he rose,"
3921,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,Why did you fear to trouble my repose?
3922,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"He either had obey’d my fond desire,"
3923,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,Or seen his mother pierced with grief expire.
3924,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Bid Dolius quick attend, the faithful slave"
3925,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,Whom to my nuptial train Icarius gave
3926,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,To tend the fruit groves: with incessant speed
3927,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,He shall this violence of death decreed
3928,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,To good Laertes tell. Experienced age
3929,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,May timely intercept the ruffian rage.
3930,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Convene the tribes the murderous plot reveal,"
3931,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,And to their power to save his race appeal.”
3932,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,
3933,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,Then Euryclea thus: “My dearest dread;
3934,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Though to the sword I bow this hoary head,"
3935,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Or if a dungeon be the pain decreed,"
3936,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,I own me conscious of the unpleasing deed;
3937,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Auxiliar to his flight, my aid implored,"
3938,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,With wine and viands I the vessel stored;
3939,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"A solemn oath, imposed, the secret seal’d,"
3940,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,Till the twelfth dawn the light of day reveal’d.
3941,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Dreading the effect of a fond mother’s fear,"
3942,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,He dared not violate your royal ear.
3943,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"But bathe, and, in imperial robes array’d,"
3944,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Pay due devotions to the martial maid,"
3945,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,And rest affianced in her guardian aid.
3946,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Send not to good Laertes, nor engage"
3947,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,In toils of state the miseries of age:
3948,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,Tis impious to surmise the powers divine
3949,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,To ruin doom the Jove-descended line;
3950,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Long shall the race of just Arcesius reign,"
3951,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,And isles remote enlarge his old domain.”
3952,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,
3953,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"The queen her speech with calm attention hears,"
3954,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,Her eyes restrain the silver-streaming tears:
3955,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"She bathes, and robed, the sacred dome ascends;"
3956,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,Her pious speed a female train attends:
3957,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"The salted cakes in canisters are laid,"
3958,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,And thus the queen invokes Minerva’s aid;
3959,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,
3960,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"“Daughter divine of Jove, whose arm can wield"
3961,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"The avenging bolt, and shake the dreadful shield"
3962,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,If e’er Ulysses to thy fane preferr’d
3963,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,The best and choicest of his flock and herd;
3964,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Hear, goddess, hear, by those oblations won;"
3965,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,And for the pious sire preserve the son;
3966,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"His wish’d return with happy power befriend,"
3967,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,And on the suitors let thy wrath descend.”
3968,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,
3969,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,She ceased; shrill ecstasies of joy declare
3970,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,The favouring goddess present to the prayer;
3971,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"The suitors heard, and deem’d the mirthful voice"
3972,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,A signal of her hymeneal choice;
3973,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,Whilst one most jovial thus accosts the board:
3974,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,
3975,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,“Too late the queen selects a second lord;
3976,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"In evil hour the nuptial rite intends,"
3977,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,When o’er her son disastrous death impends.”
3978,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Thus he, unskill’d of what the fates provide!"
3979,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,But with severe rebuke Antinous cried:
3980,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,
3981,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,“These empty vaunts will make the voyage vain:
3982,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,Alarm not with discourse the menial train:
3983,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"The great event with silent hope attend,"
3984,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,Our deeds alone our counsel must commend.”
3985,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"His speech thus ended short, he frowning rose,"
3986,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,And twenty chiefs renowned for valour chose;
3987,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Down to the strand he speeds with haughty strides,"
3988,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Where anchor’d in the bay the vessel rides,"
3989,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Replete with mail and military store,"
3990,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,In all her tackle trim to quit the shore.
3991,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"The desperate crew ascend, unfurl the sails"
3992,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,(The seaward prow invites the tardy gales);
3993,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,Then take repast till Hesperus display’d
3994,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"His golden circlet, in the western shade."
3995,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,
3996,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Meantime the queen, without reflection due,"
3997,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Heart-wounded, to the bed of state withdrew:"
3998,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"In her sad breast the prince’s fortunes roll,"
3999,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,And hope and doubt alternate seize her soul.
4000,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"So when the woodman’s toil her cave surrounds,"
4001,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"And with the hunter’s cry the grove resounds,"
4002,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"With grief and rage the mother-lion stung,"
4003,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Fearless herself, yet trembles for her young,"
4004,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"While pensive in the silent slumberous shade,"
4005,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,Sleep’s gentle powers her drooping eyes invade;
4006,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Minerva, life-like, on embodied air"
4007,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,Impress’d the form of Iphthima the fair;
4008,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"(Icarius’ daughter she, whose blooming charms"
4009,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,Allured Eumelus to her virgin arms;
4010,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"A sceptred lord, who o’er the fruitful plain"
4011,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,Of Thessaly wide stretched his ample reign:)
4012,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"As Pallas will’d, along the sable skies,"
4013,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"To calm the queen, the phantom sister flies."
4014,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Swift on the regal dome, descending right,"
4015,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,The bolted valves are pervious to her flight.
4016,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Close to her head the pleasing vision stands,"
4017,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,And thus performs Minerva’s high commands
4018,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,
4019,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"“O why, Penelope, this causeless fear,"
4020,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,To render sleep’s soft blessing unsincere?
4021,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,Alike devote to sorrow’s dire extreme
4022,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"The day-reflection, and the midnight-dream!"
4023,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"Thy son the gods propitious will restore,"
4024,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,And bid thee cease his absence to deplore.”
4025,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,
4026,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,To whom the queen (whilst yet in pensive mind
4027,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,Was in the silent gates of sleep confined):
4028,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"“O sister to my soul forever dear,"
4029,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,Why this first visit to reprove my fear?
4030,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,How in a realm so distant should you know
4031,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,From what deep source my ceaseless sorrows flow?
4032,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"To all my hope my royal lord is lost,"
4033,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"His country’s buckler, and the Grecian boast;"
4034,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"And with consummate woe to weigh me down,"
4035,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,"The heir of all his honours and his crown,"
4036,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,My darling son is fled! an easy prey

4040,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,
4041,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,“Courage resume (the shadowy form replied);
4042,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,In the protecting care of Heaven confide;
4043,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,On him attends the blue eyed martial maid:

4056,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,The windy satisfaction of the tongue.”
4057,THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS.,

4086,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Pallas in a council of the gods complains of the detention of Ulysses
4087,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,in the Island of Calypso: whereupon Mercury is sent to command his
4088,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,removal. The seat of Calypso described. She consents with much
4089,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"difficulty; and Ulysses builds a vessel with his own hands, in which he"
4090,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"embarks. Neptune overtakes him with a terrible tempest, in which he is"
4091,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"shipwrecked, and in the last danger of death; till Lencothea, a"
4092,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"sea-goddess, assists him, and, after innumerable perils, he gets ashore"
4093,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,on Phæacia.

4096,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"The saffron morn, with early blushes spread,"
4097,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Now rose refulgent from Tithonus’ bed;
4098,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"With new-born day to gladden mortal sight,"
4099,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light.
4100,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Then met the eternal synod of the sky,"
4101,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Before the god, who thunders from on high,"
4102,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Supreme in might, sublime in majesty."
4103,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Pallas, to these, deplores the unequal fates"
4104,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Of wise Ulysses and his toils relates:
4105,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Her hero’s danger touch’d the pitying power,"
4106,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"The nymph’s seducements, and the magic bower."
4107,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Thus she began her plaint: “Immortal Jove!
4108,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And you who fill the blissful seats above!
4109,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Let kings no more with gentle mercy sway,"

4111,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"But crush the nations with an iron rod,"

4117,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Unbless’d he sighs, detained by lawless charms,"
4118,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And press’d unwilling in Calypso’s arms.
4119,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Nor friends are there, nor vessels to convey,"
4120,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Nor oars to cut the immeasurable way.

4122,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"His only son, their ambush’d fraud employ;"
4123,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Who, pious, following his great father’s fame,"

4134,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4135,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Then thus to Hermes the command was given:

4146,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"And swift transport him to his place of rest,"
4147,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,His vessels loaded with a plenteous store

4152,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Such is our sovereign will, and such is fate.”"
4153,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4154,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,He spoke. The god who mounts the winged winds
4155,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Fast to his feet the golden pinions binds,"
4156,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,That high through fields of air his flight sustain
4157,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"O’er the wide earth, and o’er the boundless main:"
4158,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"He grasps the wand that causes sleep to fly,"

4168,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Then, swift ascending from the azure wave,"
4169,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,He took the path that winded to the cave.
4170,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Large was the grot, in which the nymph he found"
4171,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,(The fair-hair’d nymph with every beauty crown’d).
4172,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,The cave was brighten’d with a rising blaze;
4173,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Cedar and frankincense, an odorous pile,"
4174,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Flamed on the hearth, and wide perfumed the isle;"
4175,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"While she with work and song the time divides,"
4176,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And through the loom the golden shuttle guides.
4177,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Without the grot a various sylvan scene
4178,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Appear’d around, and groves of living green;"
4179,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Poplars and alders ever quivering play’d,"
4180,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And nodding cypress form’d a fragrant shade:
4181,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"On whose high branches, waving with the storm,"
4182,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"The birds of broadest wing their mansions form,—"
4183,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"The chough, the sea-mew, the loquacious crow,—"
4184,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"and scream aloft, and skim the deeps below."
4185,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Depending vines the shelving cavern screen.
4186,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,With purple clusters blushing through the green.
4187,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Four limpid fountains from the clefts distil:
4188,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"And every fountain pours a several rill,"
4189,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,In mazy windings wandering down the hill:
4190,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Where bloomy meads with vivid greens were crown’d,"
4191,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And glowing violets threw odours round.
4192,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"A scene, where, if a god should cast his sight,"
4193,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"A god might gaze, and wander with delight!"
4194,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Joy touch’d the messenger of heaven: he stay’d
4195,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Entranced, and all the blissful haunts surveyed."
4196,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Him, entering in the cave, Calypso knew;"
4197,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,For powers celestial to each other’s view
4198,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Stand still confess’d, though distant far they lie"
4199,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"To habitants of earth, or sea, or sky."
4200,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"But sad Ulysses, by himself apart,"
4201,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Pour’d the big sorrows of his swelling heart;
4202,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"All on the lonely shore he sate to weep,"
4203,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And roll’d his eyes around the restless deep:
4204,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Toward his loved coast he roll’d his eyes in vain,"
4205,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Till, dimm’d with rising grief, they stream’d again."
4206,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4207,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Now graceful seated on her shining throne,"
4208,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,To Hermes thus the nymph divine begun:
4209,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4210,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,“God of the golden wand! on what behest
4211,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Arrivest thou here, an unexpected guest?"
4212,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Loved as thou art, thy free injunctions lay;"
4213,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,’Tis mine with joy and duty to obey.
4214,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Till now a stranger, in a happy hour"
4215,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Approach, and taste the dainties of my bower.”"
4216,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4217,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Thus having spoke, the nymph the table spread"
4218,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"(Ambrosial cates, with nectar rosy-red);"
4219,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Hermes the hospitable rite partook,"
4220,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Divine refection! then, recruited, spoke:"
4221,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4222,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"“What moves this journey from my native sky,"
4223,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"A goddess asks, nor can a god deny."
4224,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Hear then the truth. By mighty Jove’s command
4225,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Unwilling have I trod this pleasing land:
4226,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"For who, self-moved, with weary wing would sweep"
4227,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Such length of ocean and unmeasured deep;
4228,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,A world of waters! far from all the ways
4229,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Where men frequent, or sacred altars blaze!"
4230,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,But to Jove’s will submission we must pay;
4231,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,What power so great to dare to disobey?
4232,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"A man, he says, a man resides with thee,"
4233,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Of all his kind most worn with misery.
4234,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"The Greeks, (whose arms for nine long year employ’d"
4235,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Their force on Ilion, in the tenth destroy’d,)"
4236,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"At length, embarking in a luckless hour,"
4237,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"With conquest proud, incensed Minerva’s power:"
4238,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Hence on the guilty race her vengeance hurl’d,"
4239,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,With storms pursued them through the liquid world.
4240,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,There all his vessels sunk beneath the wave!
4241,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,There all his dear companions found their grave!
4242,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Saved from the jaws of death by Heaven’s decree,"
4243,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,The tempest drove him to these shores and thee.
4244,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Him, Jove now orders to his native lands"
4245,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Straight to dismiss: so destiny commands:
4246,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Impatient Fate his near return attends,"
4247,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"And calls him to his country, and his friends.”"
4248,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4249,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,E’en to her inmost soul the goddess shook;
4250,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Then thus her anguish, and her passion broke:"
4251,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,“Ungracious gods! with spite and envy cursed!
4252,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Still to your own ethereal race the worst!
4253,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Ye envy mortal and immortal joy,"
4254,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"And love, the only sweet of life destroy,"
4255,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Did ever goddess by her charms engage
4256,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"A favour’d mortal, and not feel your rage?"
4257,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"So when Aurora sought Orion’s love,"
4258,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Her joys disturbed your blissful hours above,"
4259,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Till, in Ortygia Dian’s winged dart"
4260,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Had pierced the hapless hunter to the heart,"
4261,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,So when the covert of the thrice-eared field
4262,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Saw stately Ceres to her passion yield,"
4263,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Scarce could Iasion taste her heavenly charms,"
4264,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,But Jove’s swift lightning scorched him in her arms.
4265,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"And is it now my turn, ye mighty powers!"
4266,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Am I the envy of your blissful bowers?
4267,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"A man, an outcast to the storm and wave,"
4268,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"It was my crime to pity, and to save;"
4269,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"When he who thunders rent his bark in twain,"
4270,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"And sunk his brave companions in the main,"
4271,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Alone, abandon’d, in mid-ocean tossed,"
4272,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"The sport of winds, and driven from every coast,"
4273,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Hither this man of miseries I led,"
4274,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Received the friendless, and the hungry fed;"
4275,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Nay promised (vainly promised) to bestow
4276,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Immortal life, exempt from age and woe."
4277,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,’Tis past-and Jove decrees he shall remove;
4278,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Gods as we are, we are but slaves to Jove."
4279,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Go then he must (he must, if he ordain,"
4280,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Try all those dangers, all those deeps, again);"
4281,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"But never, never shall Calypso send"
4282,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,To toils like these her husband and her friend.
4283,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"What ships have I, what sailors to convey,"
4284,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,What oars to cut the long laborious way?
4285,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Yet I’ll direct the safest means to go;
4286,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,That last advice is all I can bestow.”
4287,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4288,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,To her the power who hears the charming rod;
4289,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"“Dismiss the man, nor irritate the god;"
4290,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Prevent the rage of him who reigns above,"
4291,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,For what so dreadful as the wrath of Jove?”
4292,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Thus having said, he cut the cleaving sky,"
4293,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"And in a moment vanished from her eye,"
4294,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"The nymph, obedient to divine command,"
4295,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"To seek Ulysses, paced along the sand,"
4296,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Him pensive on the lonely beach she found,"
4297,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"With streaming eyes in briny torrents drown’d,"
4298,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And inly pining for his native shore;
4299,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,For now the soft enchantress pleased no more;
4300,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"For now, reluctant, and constrained by charms,"
4301,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Absent he lay in her desiring arms,"
4302,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"In slumber wore the heavy night away,"
4303,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,On rocks and shores consumed the tedious day;
4304,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"There sate all desolate, and sighed alone,"
4305,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,With echoing sorrows made the mountains groan.
4306,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"And roll’d his eyes o’er all the restless main,"
4307,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Till, dimmed with rising grief, they streamed again."
4308,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4309,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Here, on his musing mood the goddess press’d,"
4310,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Approaching soft, and thus the chief address’d:"
4311,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"“Unhappy man! to wasting woes a prey,"
4312,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,No more in sorrows languish life away:
4313,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Free as the winds I give thee now to rove:
4314,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Go, fell the timber of yon lofty grove,"
4315,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"And form a raft, and build the rising ship,"
4316,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Sublime to bear thee o’er the gloomy deep.
4317,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"To store the vessel let the care be mine,"
4318,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"With water from the rock and rosy wine,"
4319,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"And life-sustaining bread, and fair array,"
4320,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And prosperous gales to waft thee on the way.
4321,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"These, if the gods with my desire comply"
4322,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"(The gods, alas, more mighty far than I,"
4323,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"And better skill’d in dark events to come),"
4324,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,In peace shall land thee at thy native home.”
4325,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4326,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"With sighs Ulysses heard the words she spoke,"
4327,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Then thus his melancholy silence broke:
4328,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"“Some other motive, goddess! sways thy mind"
4329,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"(Some close design, or turn of womankind),"
4330,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Nor my return the end, nor this the way,"
4331,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"On a slight raft to pass the swelling sea,"
4332,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Huge, horrid, vast! where scarce in safety sails"
4333,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"The best-built ship, though Jove inspires the gales."
4334,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"The bold proposal how shall I fulfil,"
4335,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Dark as I am, unconscious of thy will?"
4336,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Swear, then, thou mean’st not what my soul forebodes;"
4337,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Swear by the solemn oath that binds the gods.”
4338,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4339,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Him, while he spoke, with smiles Calypso eyed,"
4340,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"And gently grasp’d his hand, and thus replied:"
4341,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"“This shows thee, friend, by old experience taught,"
4342,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"And learn’d in all the wiles of human thought,"
4343,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"How prone to doubt, how cautious, are the wise!"
4344,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"But hear, O earth, and hear, ye sacred skies!"
4345,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"And thou, O Styx! whose formidable floods"
4346,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Glide through the shades, and bind the attesting gods!"
4347,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"No form’d design, no meditated end,"
4348,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Lurks in the counsel of thy faithful friend;
4349,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Kind the persuasion, and sincere my aim;"
4350,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"The same my practice, were my fate the same."
4351,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Heaven has not cursed me with a heart of steel,"
4352,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"But given the sense to pity, and to feel.”"
4353,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4354,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Thus having said, the goddess marched before:"
4355,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,He trod her footsteps in the sandy shore.
4356,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"At the cool cave arrived, they took their state;"
4357,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,He filled the throne where Mercury had sate.
4358,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"For him the nymph a rich repast ordains,"
4359,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Such as the mortal life of man sustains;
4360,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Before herself were placed the the cates divine,"
4361,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Ambrosial banquet and celestial wine.
4362,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Their hunger satiate, and their thirst repress’d,"
4363,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Thus spoke Calypso to her godlike guest:
4364,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4365,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,“Ulysses! (with a sigh she thus began;)
4366,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,O sprung from gods! in wisdom more than man!
4367,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Is then thy home the passion of thy heart?
4368,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Thus wilt thou leave me, are we thus to part?"
4369,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Farewell! and ever joyful mayst thou be,"
4370,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Nor break the transport with one thought of me.
4371,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"But ah, Ulysses! wert thou given to know"
4372,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"What Fate yet dooms these still to undergo,"
4373,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Thy heart might settle in this scene of ease.
4374,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And e’en these slighted charms might learn to please.
4375,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"A willing goddess, and immortal life,"
4376,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Might banish from thy mind an absent wife.
4377,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Am I inferior to a mortal dame?
4378,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Less soft my feature less august my frame?
4379,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Or shall the daughters of mankind compare
4380,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Their earth born beauties with the heavenly fair?”
4381,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4382,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,“Alas! for this (the prudent man replies)
4383,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Against Ulysses shall thy anger rise?
4384,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Loved and adored, O goddess as thou art,"
4385,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Forgive the weakness of a human heart.
4386,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Though well I see thy graces far above
4387,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"The dear, though mortal, object of my love,"
4388,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Of youth eternal well the difference know,"
4389,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And the short date of fading charms below;
4390,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Yet every day, while absent thus I roam,"
4391,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,I languish to return and die at home.
4392,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Whate’er the gods shall destine me to bear;
4393,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"In the black ocean or the watery war,"
4394,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,’Tis mine to master with a constant mind;
4395,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Inured to perils, to the worst resign’d,"
4396,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"By seas, by wars, so many dangers run;"
4397,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Still I can suffer; their high will he done!”
4398,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4399,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Thus while he spoke, the beamy sun descends,"
4400,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"And rising night her friendly shade extends,"
4401,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"To the close grot the lonely pair remove,"
4402,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And slept delighted with the gifts of love.
4403,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"When rosy morning call’d them from their rest,"
4404,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Ulysses robed him in the cloak and vest.
4405,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"The nymph’s fair head a veil transparent graced,"
4406,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Her swelling loins a radiant zone embraced
4407,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"With flowers of gold; an under robe, unbound,"
4408,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,In snowy waves flow’d glittering on the ground.
4409,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Forth issuing thus, she gave him first to wield"
4410,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"A weighty axe with truest temper steeled,"
4411,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"And double-edged; the handle smooth and plain,"
4412,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Wrought of the clouded olive’s easy grain;
4413,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"And next, a wedge to drive with sweepy sway"
4414,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Then to the neighboring forest led the way.
4415,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,On the lone island’s utmost verge there stood
4416,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Of poplars, pine, and firs, a lofty wood,"
4417,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Whose leafless summits to the skies aspire,"
4418,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Scorch’d by the sun, or seared by heavenly fire"
4419,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"(Already dried). These pointing out to view,"
4420,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"The nymph just show’d him, and with tears withdrew."
4421,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4422,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Now toils the hero: trees on trees o’erthrown
4423,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Fall crackling round him, and the forests groan:"
4424,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Sudden, full twenty on the plain are strow’d,"
4425,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And lopp’d and lighten’d of their branchy load.
4426,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"At equal angles these disposed to join,"
4427,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"He smooth’d and squared them by the rule and line,"
4428,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,(The wimbles for the work Calypso found)
4429,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,With those he pierced them and with clinchers bound.
4430,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Long and capacious as a shipwright forms
4431,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Some bark’s broad bottom to out-ride the storms,"
4432,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,So large he built the raft; then ribb’d it strong
4433,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"From space to space, and nail’d the planks along;"
4434,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,These form’d the sides: the deck he fashion’d last;
4435,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Then o’er the vessel raised the taper mast,"
4436,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,With crossing sail-yards dancing in the wind;
4437,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And to the helm the guiding rudder join’d
4438,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"(With yielding osiers fenced, to break the force"
4439,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Of surging waves, and steer the steady course)."
4440,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Thy loom, Calypso, for the future sails"
4441,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Supplied the cloth, capacious of the gales."
4442,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"With stays and cordage last he rigged the ship,"
4443,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"And, roll’d on levers, launch’d her in the deep."
4444,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4445,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Four days were pass’d, and now the work complete,"
4446,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Shone the fifth morn, when from her sacred seat"
4447,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"The nymph dismiss’d him (odorous garments given),"
4448,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And bathed in fragrant oils that breathed of heaven:
4449,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Then fill’d two goatskins with her hands divine,"
4450,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"With water one, and one with sable wine:"
4451,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Of every kind, provisions heaved aboard;"
4452,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And the full decks with copious viands stored.
4453,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"The goddess, last, a gentle breeze supplies,"
4454,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"To curl old Ocean, and to warm the skies."
4455,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4456,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"And now, rejoicing in the prosperous gales,"
4457,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,With beating heart Ulysses spreads his sails;
4458,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Placed at the helm he sate, and mark’d the skies,"
4459,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Nor closed in sleep his ever-watchful eyes.
4460,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"There view’d the Pleiads, and the Northern Team,"
4461,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And great Orion’s more refulgent beam.
4462,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"To which, around the axle of the sky,"
4463,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"The Bear, revolving, points his golden eye:"
4464,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Who shines exalted on the ethereal plain,"
4465,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Nor bathes his blazing forehead in the main.
4466,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Far on the left those radiant fires to keep
4467,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"The nymph directed, as he sail’d the deep."
4468,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Full seventeen nights he cut the foaming way:
4469,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,The distant land appear’d the following day:
4470,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Then swell’d to sight Phæacia’s dusky coast,"
4471,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"And woody mountains, half in vapours lost;"
4472,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"That lay before him indistinct and vast,"
4473,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Like a broad shield amid the watery waste.
4474,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4475,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"But him, thus voyaging the deeps below,"
4476,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"From far, on Solyme’s aërial brow,"
4477,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"The king of ocean saw, and seeing burn’d"
4478,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,(From Æthiopia’s happy climes return’d);
4479,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"The raging monarch shook his azure head,"
4480,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And thus in secret to his soul he said:
4481,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,“Heavens! how uncertain are the powers on high!
4482,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Is then reversed the sentence of the sky,"
4483,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,In one man’s favour; while a distant guest
4484,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,I shared secure the Æthiopian feast?
4485,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Behold how near Phæacia’s land he draws;
4486,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,The land affix’d by Fate’s eternal laws
4487,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,To end his toils. Is then our anger vain?
4488,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,No; if this sceptre yet commands the main.”
4489,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4490,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"He spoke, and high the forky trident hurl’d,"
4491,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Rolls clouds on clouds, and stirs the watery world,"
4492,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"At once the face of earth and sea deforms,"
4493,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Swells all the winds, and rouses all the storms."
4494,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Down rushed the night: east, west, together roar;"
4495,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And south and north roll mountains to the shore.
4496,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Then shook the hero, to despair resign’d,"
4497,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And question’d thus his yet unconquer’d mind;
4498,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4499,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,“Wretch that I am! what farther fates attend
4500,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"This life of toils, and what my destined end?"
4501,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Too well, alas! the island goddess knew"
4502,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,On the black sea what perils should ensue.
4503,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,New horrors now this destined head inclose;
4504,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Untill’d is yet the measure of my woes;
4505,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,With what a cloud the brows of heaven are crown’d;
4506,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,What raging winds! what roaring waters round!
4507,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,’Tis Jove himself the swelling tempest rears;
4508,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Death, present death, on every side appears."
4509,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Happy! thrice happy! who, in battle slain,"
4510,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Press’d in Atrides’ cause the Trojan plain!
4511,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Oh! had I died before that well-fought wall!
4512,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Had some distinguish’d day renown’d my fall
4513,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,(Such as was that when showers of javelins fled
4514,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"From conquering Troy around Achilles dead),"
4515,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"All Greece had paid me solemn funerals then,"
4516,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And spread my glory with the sons of men.
4517,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"A shameful fate now hides my hapless head,"
4518,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Unwept, unnoted, and for ever dead!”"
4519,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4520,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"A mighty wave rush’d o’er him as he spoke,"
4521,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"The raft is cover’d, and the mast is broke;"
4522,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Swept from the deck and from the rudder torn,"
4523,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Far on the swelling surge the chief was borne;
4524,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,While by the howling tempest rent in twain
4525,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Flew sail and sail-yards rattling o’er the main.
4526,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Long-press’d, he heaved beneath the weighty wave,"
4527,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Clogg’d by the cumbrous vest Calypso gave;
4528,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"At length, emerging, from his nostrils wide"
4529,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And gushing mouth effused the briny tide;
4530,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"E’en then not mindless of his last retreat,"
4531,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"He seized the raft, and leap’d into his seat,"
4532,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Strong with the fear of death. In rolling flood,"
4533,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Now here, now there, impell’d the floating wood"
4534,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"As when a heap of gather’d thorns is cast,"
4535,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Now to, now fro, before the autumnal blast;"
4536,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Together clung, it rolls around the field;"
4537,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"So roll’d the float, and so its texture held:"
4538,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"And now the south, and now the north, bear sway,"
4539,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"And now the east the foamy floods obey,"
4540,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And now the west wind whirls it o’er the sea.
4541,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"The wandering chief with toils on toils oppress’d,"
4542,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Leucothea saw, and pity touch’d her breast."
4543,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"(Herself a mortal once, of Cadmus’ strain,"
4544,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,But now an azure sister of the main)
4545,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Swift as a sea-mew springing from the flood,"
4546,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,All radiant on the raft the goddess stood;
4547,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Then thus address’d him: “Thou whom heaven decrees
4548,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"To Neptune’s wrath, stern tyrant of the seas!"
4549,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"(Unequal contest!) not his rage and power,"
4550,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Great as he is, such virtue shall devour."
4551,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"What I suggest, thy wisdom will perform:"
4552,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Forsake thy float, and leave it to the storm;"
4553,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Strip off thy garments; Neptune’s fury brave
4554,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"With naked strength, and plunge into the wave."
4555,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"To reach Phæacia all thy nerves extend,"
4556,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,There Fate decrees thy miseries shall end.
4557,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"This heavenly scarf beneath thy bosom bind,"
4558,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And live; give all thy terrors to the wind.
4559,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Soon as thy arms the happy shore shall gain,"
4560,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Return the gift, and cast it in the main:"
4561,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Observe my orders, and with heed obey,"
4562,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Cast it far off, and turn thy eyes away.”"
4563,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4564,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"With that, her hand the sacred veil bestows,"
4565,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Then down the deeps she dived from whence she rose;
4566,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"A moment snatch’d the shining form away,"
4567,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And all was covered with the curling sea.
4568,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4569,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Struck with amaze, yet still to doubt inclined,"
4570,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"He stands suspended, and explores his mind:"
4571,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,“What shall I do? unhappy me! who knows
4572,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,But other gods intend me other woes?
4573,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Whoe’er thou art, I shall not blindly join"
4574,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Thy pleaded reason, but consult with mine:"
4575,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,For scarce in ken appears that distant isle
4576,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Thy voice foretells me shall conclude my toil.
4577,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Thus then I judge: while yet the planks sustain
4578,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"The wild waves’ fury, here I fix’d remain:"
4579,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"But, when their texture to the tempest yields,"
4580,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"I launch adventurous on the liquid fields,"
4581,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Join to the help of gods the strength of man,"
4582,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"And take this method, since the best I can.”"
4583,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4584,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"While thus his thoughts an anxious council hold,"
4585,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,The raging god a watery mountain roll’d;
4586,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Like a black sheet the whelming billows spread,"
4587,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Burst o’er the float, and thunder’d on his head."
4588,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Planks, beams, disparted fly; the scatter’d wood"
4589,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Rolls diverse, and in fragments strews the flood."
4590,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"So the rude Boreas, o’er the field new-shorn,"
4591,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Tosses and drives the scatter’d heaps of corn.
4592,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And now a single beam the chief bestrides:
4593,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"There poised a while above the bounding tides,"
4594,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"His limbs discumbers of the clinging vest,"
4595,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And binds the sacred cincture round his breast:
4596,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Then prone an ocean in a moment flung,"
4597,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Stretch’d wide his eager arms, and shot the seas along."
4598,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"All naked now, on heaving billows laid,"
4599,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Stern Neptune eyed him, and contemptuous said:"
4600,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4601,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"“Go, learn’d in woes, and other foes essay!"
4602,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Go, wander helpless on the watery way;"
4603,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Thus, thus find out the destined shore, and then"
4604,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,(If Jove ordains it) mix with happier men.
4605,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Whate’er thy fate, the ills our wrath could raise"
4606,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Shall last remember’d in thy best of days.”
4607,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4608,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"This said, his sea-green steeds divide the foam,"
4609,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And reach high Ægæ and the towery dome.
4610,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Now, scarce withdrawn the fierce earth-shaking power,"
4611,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Jove’s daughter Pallas watch’d the favouring hour.
4612,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Back to their caves she bade the winds to fly;
4613,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And hush’d the blustering brethren of the sky.
4614,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"The drier blasts alone of Boreas away,"
4615,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And bear him soft on broken waves away;
4616,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"With gentle force impelling to that shore,"
4617,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Where fate has destined he shall toil no more.
4618,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"And now, two nights, and now two days were pass’d,"
4619,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Since wide he wander’d on the watery waste;
4620,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Heaved on the surge with intermitting breath,"
4621,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And hourly panting in the arms of death.
4622,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,The third fair morn now blazed upon the main;
4623,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Then glassy smooth lay all the liquid plain;
4624,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"The winds were hush’d, the billows scarcely curl’d,"
4625,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And a dead silence still’d the watery world;
4626,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,When lifted on a ridgy wave he spies
4627,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"The land at distance, and with sharpen’d eyes."
4628,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,As pious children joy with vast delight
4629,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,When a loved sire revives before their sight
4630,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"(Who, lingering long, has call’d on death in vain,"
4631,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Fix’d by some demon to his bed of pain,"
4632,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Till heaven by miracle his life restore);
4633,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,So joys Ulysses at the appearing shore;
4634,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And sees (and labours onward as he sees)
4635,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"The rising forests, and the tufted trees."
4636,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"And now, as near approaching as the sound"
4637,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Of human voice the listening ear may wound,"
4638,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Amidst the rocks he heard a hollow roar
4639,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Of murmuring surges breaking on the shore;
4640,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Nor peaceful port was there, nor winding bay,"
4641,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"To shield the vessel from the rolling sea,"
4642,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"But cliffs and shaggy shores, a dreadful sight!"
4643,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"All rough with rocks, with foamy billows white."
4644,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Fear seized his slacken’d limbs and beating heart,"
4645,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,As thus he communed with his soul apart;
4646,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4647,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"“Ah me! when, o’er a length of waters toss’d,"
4648,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"These eyes at last behold the unhoped-for coast,"
4649,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"No port receives me from the angry main,"
4650,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,But the loud deeps demand me back again.
4651,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Above, sharp rocks forbid access; around"
4652,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Roar the wild waves; beneath, is sea profound!"
4653,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"No footing sure affords the faithless sand,"
4654,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"To stem too rapid, and too deep to stand."
4655,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"If here I enter, my efforts are vain,"
4656,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Dash’d on the cliffs, or heaved into the main;"
4657,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Or round the island if my course I bend,"
4658,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Where the ports open, or the shores descend,"
4659,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Back to the seas the rolling surge may sweep,"
4660,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And bury all my hopes beneath the deep.
4661,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Or some enormous whale the god may send
4662,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,(For many such an Amphitrite attend);
4663,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Too well the turns of mortal chance I know,"
4664,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And hate relentless of my heavenly foe.”
4665,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"While thus he thought, a monstrous wave upbore"
4666,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"The chief, and dash’d him on the craggy shore;"
4667,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Torn was his skin, nor had the ribs been whole,"
4668,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,But Instant Pallas enter’d in his soul.
4669,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Close to the cliff with both his hands he clung,"
4670,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"And stuck adherent, and suspended hung;"
4671,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Till the huge surge roll’d off; then backward sweep
4672,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"The refluent tides, and plunge him in the deep."
4673,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"As when the polypus, from forth his cave"
4674,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Torn with full force, reluctant beats the wave,"
4675,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,His ragged claws are stuck with stones and sands;
4676,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"So the rough rock had shagg’d Ulysses hands,"
4677,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"And now had perish’d, whelm’d beneath the main,"
4678,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,The unhappy man; e’en fate had been in vain;
4679,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"But all-subduing Pallas lent her power,"
4680,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And prudence saved him in the needful hour.
4681,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Beyond the beating surge his course he bore,"
4682,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"(A wider circle, but in sight of shore),"
4683,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"With longing eyes, observing, to survey"
4684,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Some smooth ascent, or safe sequester’d bay."
4685,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Between the parting rocks at length he spied
4686,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,A failing stream with gentler waters glide;
4687,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Where to the seas the shelving shore declined,"
4688,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And form’d a bay impervious to the wind.
4689,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"To this calm port the glad Ulysses press’d,"
4690,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"And hail’d the river, and its god address’d:"
4691,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4692,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"“Whoe’er thou art, before whose stream unknown"
4693,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"I bend, a suppliant at thy watery throne,"
4694,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Hear, azure king! nor let me fly in vain"
4695,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,To thee from Neptune and the raging main
4696,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Heaven hears and pities hapless men like me,"
4697,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,For sacred even to gods is misery:
4698,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Let then thy waters give the weary rest,"
4699,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"And save a suppliant, and a man distress’d.”"
4700,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4701,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"He pray’d, and straight the gentle stream subsides,"
4702,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Detains the rushing current of his tides,"
4703,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Before the wanderer smooths the watery way,"
4704,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And soft receives him from the rolling sea.
4705,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"That moment, fainting as he touch’d the shore,"
4706,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,He dropp’d his sinewy arms: his knees no more
4707,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Perform’d their office, or his weight upheld:"
4708,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,His swoln heart heaved; his bloated body swell’d:
4709,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,From mouth and nose the briny torrent ran;
4710,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"And lost in lassitude lay all the man,"
4711,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Deprived of voice, of motion, and of breath;"
4712,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,The soul scarce waking in the arms of death.
4713,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Soon as warm life its wonted office found,"
4714,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,The mindful chief Leucothea’s scarf unbound;
4715,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Observant of her word, he turn’d aside"
4716,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"His head, and cast it on the rolling tide."
4717,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Behind him far, upon the purple waves,"
4718,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"The waters waft it, and the nymph receives."
4719,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4720,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Now parting from the stream, Ulysses found"
4721,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,A mossy bank with pliant rushes crown’d;
4722,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"The bank he press’d, and gently kiss’d the ground;"
4723,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Where on the flowery herb as soft he lay,"
4724,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Thus to his soul the sage began to say:
4725,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4726,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"“What will ye next ordain, ye powers on high!"
4727,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"And yet, ah yet, what fates are we to try?"
4728,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Here by the stream, if I the night out-wear,"
4729,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Thus spent already, how shall nature bear"
4730,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"The dews descending, and nocturnal air;"
4731,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Or chilly vapours breathing from the flood
4732,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"When morning rises?—If I take the wood,"
4733,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And in thick shelter of innumerous boughs
4734,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Enjoy the comfort gentle sleep allows;
4735,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Though fenced from cold, and though my toil be pass’d,"
4736,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,What savage beasts may wander in the waste?
4737,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Perhaps I yet may fall a bloody prey
4738,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"To prowling bears, or lions in the way.”"
4739,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,
4740,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Thus long debating in himself he stood:
4741,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"At length he took the passage to the wood,"
4742,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Whose shady horrors on a rising brow
4743,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Waved high, and frown’d upon the stream below."
4744,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"There grew two olives, closest of the grove,"
4745,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"With roots entwined, the branches interwove;"
4746,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Alike their leaves, but not alike they smiled"
4747,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"With sister-fruits; one fertile, one was wild."
4748,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Nor here the sun’s meridian rays had power,"
4749,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Nor wind sharp-piercing, nor the rushing shower;"
4750,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,The verdant arch so close its texture kept:
4751,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Beneath this covert great Ulysses crept.
4752,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Of gather’d leaves an ample bed he made
4753,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,(Thick strewn by tempest through the bowery shade);
4754,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Where three at least might winter’s cold defy,"
4755,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Though Boreas raged along the inclement sky.
4756,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"This store with joy the patient hero found,"
4757,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"And, sunk amidst them, heap’d the leaves around."
4758,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"As some poor peasant, fated to reside"
4759,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Remote from neighbours in a forest wide,"
4760,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Studious to save what human wants require,"
4761,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"In embers heap’d, preserves the seeds of fire:"
4762,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Hid in dry foliage thus Ulysses lies,"
4763,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,Till Pallas pour’d soft slumbers on his eyes;
4764,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,And golden dreams (the gift of sweet repose)
4765,THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO,"Lull’d all his cares, and banish’d all his woes."

4776,ARGUMENT.,"Pallas appearing in a dream in to Nausicaa (the daughter of Alcinous,"
4777,ARGUMENT.,"king of Phæacia, commands her to descend to the river, and wash the"
4778,ARGUMENT.,"robes of state, in preparation for her nuptials. Nausicaa goes with her"
4779,ARGUMENT.,"handmaidens to the river; where, while the garments are spread on the"
4780,ARGUMENT.,"bank, they divert themselves in sports. Their voices awaken Ulysses,"
4781,ARGUMENT.,"who, addressing himself to the princess, is by her relieved and"
4782,ARGUMENT.,"clothed, and receives directions in what manner to apply to the king"
4783,ARGUMENT.,and queen of the island.
4784,ARGUMENT.,
4785,ARGUMENT.,
4786,ARGUMENT.,"While thus the weary wanderer sunk to rest,"
4787,ARGUMENT.,"And peaceful slumbers calmed his anxious breast,"
4788,ARGUMENT.,The martial maid from heaven’s aërial height
4789,ARGUMENT.,Swift to Phæacia wing’d her rapid flight.
4790,ARGUMENT.,In elder times the soft Phæacian train
4791,ARGUMENT.,In ease possess’d the wide Hyperian plain;
4792,ARGUMENT.,"Till the Cyclopean race in arms arose,"
4793,ARGUMENT.,A lawless nation of gigantic foes;
4794,ARGUMENT.,"Then great Nausithous from Hyperia far,"
4795,ARGUMENT.,"Through seas retreating from the sounds of war,"
4796,ARGUMENT.,"The recreant nation to fair Scheria led,"
4797,ARGUMENT.,Where never science rear’d her laurell’d head;
4798,ARGUMENT.,There round his tribes a strength of wall he raised;
4799,ARGUMENT.,To heaven the glittering domes and temples blazed;
4800,ARGUMENT.,"Just to his realms, he parted grounds from grounds,"
4801,ARGUMENT.,"And shared the lands, and gave the lands their bounds."
4802,ARGUMENT.,"Now in the silent grave the monarch lay,"
4803,ARGUMENT.,And wise Alcinous held the legal sway.
4804,ARGUMENT.,
4805,ARGUMENT.,To his high palace through the fields of air
4806,ARGUMENT.,The goddess shot; Ulysses was her care.
4807,ARGUMENT.,"There, as the night in silence roll’d away,"
4808,ARGUMENT.,A heaven of charms divine Nausicaa lay:
4809,ARGUMENT.,Through the thick gloom the shining portals blaze;
4810,ARGUMENT.,"Two nymphs the portals guard, each nymph a Grace,"
4811,ARGUMENT.,Light as the viewless air the warrior maid
4812,ARGUMENT.,"Glides through the valves, and hovers round her head;"
4813,ARGUMENT.,"A favourite virgin’s blooming form she took,"
4814,ARGUMENT.,"From Dymas sprung, and thus the vision spoke:"
4815,ARGUMENT.,
4816,ARGUMENT.,“Oh Indolent! to waste thy hours away!
4817,ARGUMENT.,And sleep’st thou careless of the bridal day!
4818,ARGUMENT.,Thy spousal ornament neglected lies;
4819,ARGUMENT.,"Arise, prepare the bridal train, arise!"
4820,ARGUMENT.,"A just applause the cares of dress impart,"
4821,ARGUMENT.,And give soft transport to a parent’s heart.
4822,ARGUMENT.,"Haste, to the limpid stream direct thy way,"
4823,ARGUMENT.,When the gay morn unveils her smiling ray;
4824,ARGUMENT.,"Haste to the stream! companion of thy care,"
4825,ARGUMENT.,"Lo, I thy steps attend, thy labours share."
4826,ARGUMENT.,"Virgin, awake! the marriage hour is nigh,"
4827,ARGUMENT.,See from their thrones thy kindred monarchs sigh!
4828,ARGUMENT.,"The royal car at early dawn obtain,"
4829,ARGUMENT.,And order mules obedient to the rein;
4830,ARGUMENT.,"For rough the way, and distant rolls the wave,"
4831,ARGUMENT.,"Where their fair vests Phæacian virgins lave,"
4832,ARGUMENT.,In pomp ride forth; for pomp becomes the great
4833,ARGUMENT.,And majesty derives a grace from state.”
4834,ARGUMENT.,"Then to the palaces of heaven she sails,"
4835,ARGUMENT.,Incumbent on the wings of wafting gales;
4836,ARGUMENT.,"The seat of gods; the regions mild of peace,"
4837,ARGUMENT.,"Full joy, and calm eternity of ease."
4838,ARGUMENT.,"There no rude winds presume to shake the skies,"
4839,ARGUMENT.,"No rains descend, no snowy vapours rise;"
4840,ARGUMENT.,But on immortal thrones the blest repose;
4841,ARGUMENT.,The firmament with living splendours glows.
4842,ARGUMENT.,"Hither the goddess winged the aërial way,"
4843,ARGUMENT.,Through heaven’s eternal gates that blazed with day.
4844,ARGUMENT.,
4845,ARGUMENT.,Now from her rosy car Aurora shed
4846,ARGUMENT.,"The dawn, and all the orient flamed with red."
4847,ARGUMENT.,"Up rose the virgin with the morning light,"
4848,ARGUMENT.,Obedient to the vision of the night.
4849,ARGUMENT.,"The queen she sought, the queen her hours bestowed"
4850,ARGUMENT.,In curious works; the whirling spindle glow’d
4851,ARGUMENT.,"With crimson threads, while busy damsels call"
4852,ARGUMENT.,"The snowy fleece, or twist the purpled wool."
4853,ARGUMENT.,Meanwhile Phæacia’s peers in council sate;
4854,ARGUMENT.,From his high dome the king descends in state;
4855,ARGUMENT.,Then with a filial awe the royal maid
4856,ARGUMENT.,"Approach’d him passing, and submissive said:"
4857,ARGUMENT.,
4858,ARGUMENT.,"“Will my dread sire his ear regardful deign,"
4859,ARGUMENT.,And may his child the royal car obtain?
4860,ARGUMENT.,"Say, with my garments shall I bend my way?"
4861,ARGUMENT.,Where through the vales the mazy waters stray?
4862,ARGUMENT.,"A dignity of dress adorns the great,"
4863,ARGUMENT.,And kings draw lustre from the robe of state.
4864,ARGUMENT.,Five sons thou hast; three wait the bridal day.
4865,ARGUMENT.,And spotless robes become the young and gay;
4866,ARGUMENT.,"So when with praise amid the dance they shine,"
4867,ARGUMENT.,By these my cares adorn’d that praise is mine.”
4868,ARGUMENT.,
4869,ARGUMENT.,Thus she: but blushes ill-restrain’d betray
4870,ARGUMENT.,"Her thoughts intentive on the bridal day,"
4871,ARGUMENT.,"The conscious sire the dawning blush survey’d,"
4872,ARGUMENT.,"And, smiling, thus bespoke the blooming maid"
4873,ARGUMENT.,"“My child, my darling joy, the car receive;"
4874,ARGUMENT.,"That, and whate’er our daughter asks, we give.”"
4875,ARGUMENT.,Swift at the royal nod the attending train
4876,ARGUMENT.,"The car prepare, the mules incessant rein,"
4877,ARGUMENT.,The blooming virgin with despatchful cares
4878,ARGUMENT.,"Tunics, and stoles, and robes imperial, bears."
4879,ARGUMENT.,"The queen, assiduous to her train assigns"
4880,ARGUMENT.,"The sumptuous viands, and the flavorous wines."
4881,ARGUMENT.,"The train prepare a cruse of curious mould,"
4882,ARGUMENT.,"A cruse of fragrance, form’d of burnish’d gold;"
4883,ARGUMENT.,Odour divine! whose soft refreshing streams
4884,ARGUMENT.,"Sleek the smooth skin, and scent the snowy limbs."
4885,ARGUMENT.,
4886,ARGUMENT.,"Now mounting the gay seat, the silken reins"
4887,ARGUMENT.,Shine in her hand; along the sounding plains
4888,ARGUMENT.,Swift fly the mules; nor rode the nymph alone;
4889,ARGUMENT.,"Around, a bevy of bright damsels shone."
4890,ARGUMENT.,They seek the cisterns where Phæacian dames
4891,ARGUMENT.,Wash their fair garments in the limpid streams;
4892,ARGUMENT.,"Where, gathering into depth from falling rills,"
4893,ARGUMENT.,The lucid wave a spacious bason fills.
4894,ARGUMENT.,"The mules, unharness’d, range beside the main,"
4895,ARGUMENT.,Or crop the verdant herbage of the plain.
4896,ARGUMENT.,
4897,ARGUMENT.,"Then emulous the royal robes they lave,"
4898,ARGUMENT.,And plunge the vestures in the cleansing wave
4899,ARGUMENT.,"(The vestures cleansed o’erspread the shelly sand,"
4900,ARGUMENT.,Their snowy lustre whitens all the strand);
4901,ARGUMENT.,"Then with a short repast relieve their toil,"
4902,ARGUMENT.,And o’er their limbs diffuse ambrosial oil;
4903,ARGUMENT.,"And while the robes imbibe the solar ray,"
4904,ARGUMENT.,O’er the green mead the sporting virgins play
4905,ARGUMENT.,"(Their shining veils unbound). Along the skies,"
4906,ARGUMENT.,"Toss’d and retoss’d, the ball incessant flies."
4907,ARGUMENT.,"They sport, they feast; Nausicaa lifts her voice,"
4908,ARGUMENT.,"And, warbling sweet, makes earth and heaven rejoice."
4909,ARGUMENT.,
4910,ARGUMENT.,"As when o’er Erymanth Diana roves,"
4911,ARGUMENT.,Or wide Täygetus’ resounding groves;
4912,ARGUMENT.,"A sylvan train the huntress queen surrounds,"
4913,ARGUMENT.,Her rattling quiver from her shoulders sounds:
4914,ARGUMENT.,"Fierce in the sport, along the mountain’s brow"
4915,ARGUMENT.,"They bay the boar, or chase the bounding roe;"
4916,ARGUMENT.,"High o’er the lawn, with more majestic pace,"
4917,ARGUMENT.,Above the nymphs she treads with stately grace;
4918,ARGUMENT.,Distinguish’d excellence the goddess proves;
4919,ARGUMENT.,Exults Latona as the virgin moves.
4920,ARGUMENT.,"With equal grace Nausicaa trod the plain,"
4921,ARGUMENT.,And shone transcendent o’er the beauteous train.
4922,ARGUMENT.,
4923,ARGUMENT.,Meantime (the care and favourite of the skies
4924,ARGUMENT.,"Wrapp’d in imbowering shade, Ulysses lies,"
4925,ARGUMENT.,His woes forgot! but Pallas now address’d
4926,ARGUMENT.,To break the bands of all-composing rest.
4927,ARGUMENT.,Forth from her snowy hand Nausicaa threw
4928,ARGUMENT.,The various ball; the ball erroneous flew
4929,ARGUMENT.,"And swam the stream; loud shrieks the virgin train,"
4930,ARGUMENT.,And the loud shriek redoubles from the main.
4931,ARGUMENT.,"Waked by the shrilling sound, Ulysses rose,"
4932,ARGUMENT.,"And, to the deaf woods wailing, breathed his woes:"
4933,ARGUMENT.,
4934,ARGUMENT.,"“Ah me! on what inhospitable coast,"
4935,ARGUMENT.,On what new region is Ulysses toss’d;
4936,ARGUMENT.,Possess’d by wild barbarians fierce in arms;
4937,ARGUMENT.,"Or men, whose bosom tender pity warms?"
4938,ARGUMENT.,What sounds are these that gather from he shores?
4939,ARGUMENT.,"The voice of nymphs that haunt the sylvan bowers,"
4940,ARGUMENT.,The fair-hair’d Dryads of the shady wood;
4941,ARGUMENT.,Or azure daughters of the silver flood;
4942,ARGUMENT.,"Or human voice? but issuing from the shades,"
4943,ARGUMENT.,Why cease I straight to learn what sound invades?”
4944,ARGUMENT.,
4945,ARGUMENT.,"Then, where the grove with leaves umbrageous bends,"
4946,ARGUMENT.,With forceful strength a branch the hero rends;
4947,ARGUMENT.,Around his loins the verdant cincture spreads
4948,ARGUMENT.,A wreathy foliage and concealing shades.
4949,ARGUMENT.,"As when a lion in the midnight hours,"
4950,ARGUMENT.,"Beat by rude blasts, and wet with wintry showers,"
4951,ARGUMENT.,Descends terrific from the mountains brow;
4952,ARGUMENT.,With living flames his rolling eye balls glow;
4953,ARGUMENT.,"With conscious strength elate, he bends his way,"
4954,ARGUMENT.,"Majestically fierce, to seize his prey"
4955,ARGUMENT.,"(The steer or stag;) or, with keen hunger bold,"
4956,ARGUMENT.,Spring o’er the fence and dissipates the fold.
4957,ARGUMENT.,"No less a terror, from the neighbouring groves"
4958,ARGUMENT.,(Rough from the tossing surge) Ulysses moves;
4959,ARGUMENT.,"Urged on by want, and recent from the storms;"
4960,ARGUMENT.,The brackish ooze his manly grace deforms.
4961,ARGUMENT.,Wide o’er the shore with many a piercing cry
4962,ARGUMENT.,"To rocks, to caves, the frightened virgins fly;"
4963,ARGUMENT.,"All but the nymph; the nymph stood fix’d alone,"
4964,ARGUMENT.,By Pallas arm’d with boldness not her own.
4965,ARGUMENT.,"Meantime in dubious thought the king awaits,"
4966,ARGUMENT.,"And, self-considering, as he stands, debates;"
4967,ARGUMENT.,"Distant his mournful story to declare,"
4968,ARGUMENT.,Or prostrate at her knee address the prayer.
4969,ARGUMENT.,"But fearful to offend, by wisdom sway’d,"
4970,ARGUMENT.,At awful distance he accosts the maid:
4971,ARGUMENT.,
4972,ARGUMENT.,"“If from the skies a goddess, or if earth"
4973,ARGUMENT.,"(Imperial virgin) boast thy glorious birth,"
4974,ARGUMENT.,To thee I bend! If in that bright disguise
4975,ARGUMENT.,"Thou visit earth, a daughter of the skies,"
4976,ARGUMENT.,"Hail, Dian, hail! the huntress of the groves"
4977,ARGUMENT.,"So shines majestic, and so stately moves,"
4978,ARGUMENT.,So breathes an air divine! But if thy race
4979,ARGUMENT.,"Be mortal, and this earth thy native place,"
4980,ARGUMENT.,"Blest is the father from whose loins you sprung,"
4981,ARGUMENT.,Blest is the mother at whose breast you hung.
4982,ARGUMENT.,"Blest are the brethren who thy blood divide,"
4983,ARGUMENT.,To such a miracle of charms allied:
4984,ARGUMENT.,"Joyful they see applauding princes gaze,"
4985,ARGUMENT.,When stately in the dance you swim the harmonious maze.
4986,ARGUMENT.,"But blest o’er all, the youth with heavenly charms,"
4987,ARGUMENT.,Who clasps the bright perfection in his arms!
4988,ARGUMENT.,"Never, I never view’d till this blest hour"
4989,ARGUMENT.,"Such finish’d grace! I gaze, and I adore!"
4990,ARGUMENT.,Thus seems the palm with stately honours crown’d
4991,ARGUMENT.,By Phœbus’ altars; thus o’erlooks the ground;
4992,ARGUMENT.,"The pride of Delos. (By the Delian coast,"
4993,ARGUMENT.,"I voyaged, leader of a warrior-host,"
4994,ARGUMENT.,"But ah, how changed! from thence my sorrow flows;"
4995,ARGUMENT.,"O fatal voyage, source of all my woes;)"
4996,ARGUMENT.,"Raptured I stood, and as this hour amazed,"
4997,ARGUMENT.,With reverence at the lofty wonder gazed:
4998,ARGUMENT.,Raptured I stand! for earth ne’er knew to bear
4999,ARGUMENT.,"A plant so stately, or a nymph so fair."
5000,ARGUMENT.,"Awed from access, I lift my suppliant hands;"
5001,ARGUMENT.,"For Misery, O queen! before thee stands."
5002,ARGUMENT.,"Twice ten tempestuous nights I roll’d, resign’d"
5003,ARGUMENT.,"To roaring billows, and the warring wind;"
5004,ARGUMENT.,"Heaven bade the deep to spare; but heaven, my foe,"
5005,ARGUMENT.,Spares only to inflict some mightier woe.
5006,ARGUMENT.,"Inured to cares, to death in all its forms;"
5007,ARGUMENT.,"Outcast I rove, familiar with the storms."
5008,ARGUMENT.,Once more I view the face of human kind:
5009,ARGUMENT.,Oh let soft pity touch thy generous mind!
5010,ARGUMENT.,"Unconscious of what air I breathe, I stand"
5011,ARGUMENT.,"Naked, defenceless on a narrow land."
5012,ARGUMENT.,Propitious to my wants a vest supply
5013,ARGUMENT.,To guard the wretched from the inclement sky:
5014,ARGUMENT.,"So may the gods, who heaven and earth control,"
5015,ARGUMENT.,"Crown the chaste wishes of thy virtuous soul,"
5016,ARGUMENT.,On thy soft hours their choicest blessings shed;
5017,ARGUMENT.,Blest with a husband be thy bridal bed;
5018,ARGUMENT.,"Blest be thy husband with a blooming race,"
5019,ARGUMENT.,And lasting union crown your blissful days.
5020,ARGUMENT.,"The gods, when they supremely bless, bestow"
5021,ARGUMENT.,Firm union on their favourites below;
5022,ARGUMENT.,"Then envy grieves, with inly-pining hate;"
5023,ARGUMENT.,"The good exult, and heaven is in our state.”"
5024,ARGUMENT.,
5025,ARGUMENT.,"To whom the nymph: “O stranger, cease thy care;"
5026,ARGUMENT.,"Wise is thy soul, but man is born to bear;"
5027,ARGUMENT.,"Jove weighs affairs of earth in dubious scales,"
5028,ARGUMENT.,"And the good suffers, while the bad prevails."
5029,ARGUMENT.,"Bear, with a soul resign’d, the will of Jove;"
5030,ARGUMENT.,"Who breathes, must mourn: thy woes are from above."
5031,ARGUMENT.,"But since thou tread’st our hospitable shore,"
5032,ARGUMENT.,"’Tis mine to bid the wretched grieve no more,"
5033,ARGUMENT.,"To clothe the naked, and thy way to guide."
5034,ARGUMENT.,"Know, the Phæacian tribes this land divide;"
5035,ARGUMENT.,"From great Alcinous’ royal loins I spring,"
5036,ARGUMENT.,"A happy nation, and a happy king.”"
5037,ARGUMENT.,
5038,ARGUMENT.,"Then to her maids: “Why, why, ye coward train,"
5039,ARGUMENT.,"These fears, this flight? ye fear, and fly in vain."
5040,ARGUMENT.,"Dread ye a foe? dismiss that idle dread,"
5041,ARGUMENT.,’Tis death with hostile step these shores to tread;
5042,ARGUMENT.,"Safe in the love of heaven, an ocean flows"
5043,ARGUMENT.,"Around our realm, a barrier from the foes;"
5044,ARGUMENT.,"’Tis ours this son of sorrow to relieve,"
5045,ARGUMENT.,"Cheer the sad heart, nor let affliction grieve."
5046,ARGUMENT.,By Jove the stranger and the poor are sent;
5047,ARGUMENT.,And what to those we give to Jove is lent.
5048,ARGUMENT.,"Then food supply, and bathe his fainting limbs"
5049,ARGUMENT.,Where waving shades obscure the mazy streams.”
5050,ARGUMENT.,
5051,ARGUMENT.,"Obedient to the call, the chief they guide"
5052,ARGUMENT.,To the calm current of the secret tide;
5053,ARGUMENT.,"Close by the stream a royal dress they lay,"
5054,ARGUMENT.,"A vest and robe, with rich embroidery gay;"
5055,ARGUMENT.,"Then unguents in a vase of gold supply,"
5056,ARGUMENT.,That breathed a fragrance through the balmy sky.
5057,ARGUMENT.,
5058,ARGUMENT.,To them the king: “No longer I detain
5059,ARGUMENT.,"Your friendly care: retire, ye virgin train!"
5060,ARGUMENT.,"Retire, while from my wearied limbs I lave"
5061,ARGUMENT.,The foul pollution of the briny wave.
5062,ARGUMENT.,"Ye gods! since this worn frame refection knew,"
5063,ARGUMENT.,What scenes have I surveyed of dreadful view!
5064,ARGUMENT.,"But, nymphs, recede! sage chastity denies"
5065,ARGUMENT.,"To raise the blush, or pain the modest eyes.”"
5066,ARGUMENT.,
5067,ARGUMENT.,"The nymphs withdrawn, at once into the tide"
5068,ARGUMENT.,Active he bounds; the flashing waves divide
5069,ARGUMENT.,"O’er all his limbs his hands the waves diffuse,"
5070,ARGUMENT.,And from his locks compress the weedy ooze;
5071,ARGUMENT.,"The balmy oil, a fragrant shower, be sheds;"
5072,ARGUMENT.,"Then, dressed, in pomp magnificently treads."
5073,ARGUMENT.,The warrior-goddess gives his frame to shine
5074,ARGUMENT.,"With majesty enlarged, and air divine:"
5075,ARGUMENT.,"Back from his brows a length of hair unfurls,"
5076,ARGUMENT.,His hyacinthine locks descend in wavy curls.
5077,ARGUMENT.,"As by some artist, to whom Vulcan gives"
5078,ARGUMENT.,"His skill divine, a breathing statue lives;"
5079,ARGUMENT.,"By Pallas taught, he frames the wondrous mould,"
5080,ARGUMENT.,And o’er the silver pours the fusile gold
5081,ARGUMENT.,So Pallas his heroic frame improves
5082,ARGUMENT.,"With heavenly bloom, and like a god he moves."
5083,ARGUMENT.,A fragrance breathes around; majestic grace

5086,ARGUMENT.,Inhaling freshness from the fanning breeze.
5087,ARGUMENT.,
5088,ARGUMENT.,"The wondering nymph his glorious port survey’d,"
5089,ARGUMENT.,"And to her damsels, with amazement, said:"
5090,ARGUMENT.,
5091,ARGUMENT.,“Not without care divine the stranger treads
5092,ARGUMENT.,This land of joy; his steps some godhead leads:
5093,ARGUMENT.,"Would Jove destroy him, sure he had been driven"
5094,ARGUMENT.,"Far from this realm, the favourite isle of heaven."
5095,ARGUMENT.,"Late, a sad spectacle of woe, he trod"

5120,ARGUMENT.,Full through the narrow mouths descend the tides;
5121,ARGUMENT.,"The spacious basons arching rocks enclose,"
5122,ARGUMENT.,A sure defence from every storm that blows.
5123,ARGUMENT.,Close to the bay great Neptune’s fane adjoins;
5124,ARGUMENT.,"And near, a forum flank’d with marble shines,"

5142,ARGUMENT.,"Won by her prayer, the aërial bridegroom flies,"

5145,ARGUMENT.,"All, all the godlike worthies that adorn"

5147,ARGUMENT.,And just the blame: for female innocence
5148,ARGUMENT.,"Not only flies the guilt, but shuns the offence:"
5149,ARGUMENT.,"The unguarded virgin, as unchaste, I blame;"
5150,ARGUMENT.,"And the least freedom with the sex is shame,"

5155,ARGUMENT.,"Nigh where a grove with verdant poplars crown’d,"

5165,ARGUMENT.,"There wait embower’d, while I ascend alone"
5166,ARGUMENT.,To great Alcinous on his royal throne.
5167,ARGUMENT.,"Arrived, advance, impatient of delay,"
5168,ARGUMENT.,And to the lofty palace bend thy way:

5172,ARGUMENT.,Seek thou the queen along the rooms of state;

5174,ARGUMENT.,Around a circle of bright damsels shines;
5175,ARGUMENT.,"Part twist the threads, and part the wool dispose,"
5176,ARGUMENT.,While with the purple orb the spindle glows.
5177,ARGUMENT.,"High on a throne, amid the Scherian powers,"
5178,ARGUMENT.,My royal father shares the genial hours:

5189,ARGUMENT.,Shot through the western clouds a dewy ray;
5190,ARGUMENT.,"The grove they reach, where, from the sacred shade,"
5191,ARGUMENT.,To Pallas thus the pensive hero pray’d:
5192,ARGUMENT.,
5193,ARGUMENT.,“Daughter of Jove! whose arms in thunder wield
5194,ARGUMENT.,"The avenging bolt, and shake the dreadful shield;"
5195,ARGUMENT.,"Forsook by thee, in vain I sought thy aid"
5196,ARGUMENT.,When booming billows closed above my bead;
5197,ARGUMENT.,"Attend, unconquer’d maid! accord my vows,"
5198,ARGUMENT.,"Bid the Great hear, and pitying, heal my woes.”"
5199,ARGUMENT.,
5200,ARGUMENT.,"This heard Minerva, but forbore to fly"

5445,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,
5446,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Then to the genial hearth he bow’d his face,"
5447,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,And humbled in the ashes took his place.
5448,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Silence ensued. The eldest first began,"

5450,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Whose well-taught mind the present age surpass’d,"

5461,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,Let first the herald due libation pay
5462,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"To Jove, who guides the wanderer on his way:"
5463,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Then set the genial banquet in his view,"

5466,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"His sage advice the listening king obeys,"
5467,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"He stretch’d his hand the prudent chief to raise,"

5480,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Thus feasting high, Alcinous gave the sign,"
5481,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,And bade the herald pour the rosy wine;
5482,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,“Let all around the due libation pay
5483,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"To Jove, who guides the wanderer on his way.”"
5484,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,
5485,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,He said. Pontonous heard the king’s command;

5574,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Yet what you ask, attend. An island lies"
5575,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Beyond these tracts, and under other skies,"
5576,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Ogygia named, in Ocean’s watery arms;"
5577,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Where dwells Calypso, dreadful in her charms!"
5578,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Remote from gods or men she holds her reign,"
5579,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,Amid the terrors of a rolling main.
5580,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Me, only me, the hand of fortune bore,"
5581,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,Unblest! to tread that interdicted shore:
5582,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,When Jove tremendous in the sable deeps
5583,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,Launch’d his red lightning at our scattered ships;

5588,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Met by the goddess there with open arms,"

5597,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Or urged by Jove, or her own changeful heart."
5598,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,A raft was formed to cross the surging sea;
5599,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Herself supplied the stores and rich array,"
5600,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"And gave the gales to waft me on my way,"
5601,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"In seventeen days appear’d your pleasing coast,"
5602,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,And woody mountains half in vapours lost.
5603,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Joy touched my soul; my soul was joy’d in vain,"
5604,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,For angry Neptune roused the raging main;
5605,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"The wild winds whistle, and the billows roar;"
5606,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,The splitting raft the furious tempest tore;

5610,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"To reach this isle; but there my hopes were lost,"
5611,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,The surge impell’d me on a craggy coast.
5612,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"I chose the safer sea, and chanced to find"
5613,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"A river’s mouth impervious to the wind,"
5614,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,And clear of rocks. I fainted by the flood;
5615,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,Then took the shelter of the neighbouring wood.
5616,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"’Twas night, and, covered in the foliage deep,"
5617,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,Jove plunged my senses in the death of sleep.
5618,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"All night I slept, oblivious of my pain:"
5619,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Aurora dawned and Phœbus shined in vain,"
5620,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Nor, till oblique he sloped his evening ray,"
5621,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,Had Somnus dried the balmy dews away.
5622,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,Then female voices from the shore I heard:
5623,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"A maid amidst them, goddess-like appear’d;"
5624,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"To her I sued, she pitied my distress;"
5625,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Like thee in beauty, nor in virtue less."
5626,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,Who from such youth could hope considerate care?
5627,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,In youth and beauty wisdom is but rare!
5628,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"She gave me life, relieved with just supplies"
5629,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"My wants, and lent these robes that strike your eyes."
5630,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"This is the truth: and oh, ye powers on high!"
5631,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,Forbid that want should sink me to a lie.”
5632,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,
5633,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,To this the king: “Our daughter but express’d

5635,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Suppliant to her, since first he chose to pray,"
5636,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Why not herself did she conduct the way,"
5637,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,And with her handmaids to our court convey?”
5638,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,
5639,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,“Hero and king (Ulysses thus replied)
5640,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,Nor blame her faultless nor suspect of pride:
5641,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,She bade me follow in the attendant train;

5655,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Jove bids to set the stranger on his way,"
5656,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,And ships shall wait thee with the morning ray.
5657,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Till then, let slumber cross thy careful eyes:"
5658,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"The wakeful mariners shall watch the skies,"
5659,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,And seize the moment when the breezes rise:
5660,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Then gently waft thee to the pleasing shore,"
5661,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Where thy soul rests, and labour is no more."
5662,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Far as Euboea though thy country lay,"
5663,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,Our ships with ease transport thee in a day.
5664,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Thither of old, earth’s giant son to view,"
5665,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,On wings of wind with Rhadamanth they flew;
5666,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"This land, from whence their morning course begun,"

5668,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Your eyes shall witness and confirm my tale,"
5669,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Our youth how dexterous, and how fleet our sail,"
5670,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"When justly timed with equal sweep they row,"
5671,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,And ocean whitens in long tracks below.”
5672,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,
5673,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Thus he. No word the experienced man replies,"
5674,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,But thus to heaven (and heavenward lifts his eyes):
5675,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,“O Jove! O father! what the king accords
5676,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,Do thou make perfect! sacred be his words!
5677,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,Wide o’er the world Alcinous’ glory shine!
5678,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Let fame be his, and ah! my country mine!”"
5679,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,
5680,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Meantime Arete, for the hour of rest,"
5681,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Ordains the fleecy couch, and covering vest;"
5682,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Bids her fair train the purple quilts prepare,"
5683,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,And the thick carpets spread with busy care.
5684,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"With torches blazing in their hands they pass’d,"
5685,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,And finish’d all their queen’s command with haste:
5686,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,Then gave the signal to the willing guest:
5687,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"He rose with pleasure, and retired to rest."
5688,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"There, soft extended, to the murmuring sound"
5689,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Of the high porch, Ulysses sleeps profound!"
5690,THE COURT OF ALCINOUS.,"Within, released from cares, Alcinous lies;"

5698,BOOK VIII.,
5699,BOOK VIII.,"Alcinous calls a council, in which it is resolved to transport Ulysses"
5700,BOOK VIII.,"into his country. After which splendid entertainments are made, where"
5701,BOOK VIII.,"the celebrated musician and poet, Demodocus, plays and sings to the"
5702,BOOK VIII.,"guests. They next proceed to the games, the race, the wrestling,"
5703,BOOK VIII.,"discus, &c., where Ulysses casts a prodigious length, to the admiration"
5704,BOOK VIII.,of all the spectators. They return again to the banquet and Demodocus
5705,BOOK VIII.,"sings the loves of Mars and Venus. Ulysses, after a compliment to the"
5706,BOOK VIII.,"poet, desires him to sing the introduction of the wooden horse into"
5707,BOOK VIII.,"Troy, which subject provoking his tears, Alcinous inquires of his guest"
5708,BOOK VIII.,"his name, parentage, and fortunes."
5709,BOOK VIII.,
5710,BOOK VIII.,
5711,BOOK VIII.,"Now fair Aurora lifts her golden ray,"
5712,BOOK VIII.,And all the ruddy orient flames with day:
5713,BOOK VIII.,"Alcinous, and the chief, with dawning light,"
5714,BOOK VIII.,Rose instant from the slumbers of the night;
5715,BOOK VIII.,"Then to the council-seat they bend their way,"
5716,BOOK VIII.,And fill the shining thrones along the bay.
5717,BOOK VIII.,
5718,BOOK VIII.,"Meanwhile Minerva, in her guardian care,"
5719,BOOK VIII.,Shoots from the starry vault through fields of air;
5720,BOOK VIII.,"In form, a herald of the king, she flies"
5721,BOOK VIII.,"From peer to peer, and thus incessant cries;"
5722,BOOK VIII.,
5723,BOOK VIII.,"“Nobles and chiefs who rule Phæacia’s states,"
5724,BOOK VIII.,The king in council your attendance waits;
5725,BOOK VIII.,"A prince of grace divine your aid implores,"

5727,BOOK VIII.,
5728,BOOK VIII.,"She spoke, and sudden with tumultuous sounds"
5729,BOOK VIII.,Of thronging multitudes the shore rebounds:
5730,BOOK VIII.,At once the seats they fill; and every eye
5731,BOOK VIII.,"Glazed, as before some brother of the sky."
5732,BOOK VIII.,"Pallas with grace divine his form improves,"
5733,BOOK VIII.,"More high he treads, and more enlarged he moves:"
5734,BOOK VIII.,"She sheds celestial bloom, regard to draw;"
5735,BOOK VIII.,"And gives a dignity of mien, to awe;"
5736,BOOK VIII.,"With strength, the future prize of fame to play,"
5737,BOOK VIII.,And gather all the honours of the day.
5738,BOOK VIII.,
5739,BOOK VIII.,Then from his glittering throne Alcinous rose;
5740,BOOK VIII.,“Attend (he cried) while we our will disclose.
5741,BOOK VIII.,"Your present aid this godlike stranger craves,"
5742,BOOK VIII.,Toss’d by rude tempest through a war of waves;

5744,BOOK VIII.,Or nations subject to the western ray.
5745,BOOK VIII.,"Then grant, what here all sons of woe obtain"
5746,BOOK VIII.,(For here affliction never pleads in vain);

5749,BOOK VIII.,"Launch the tall back, and order every oar;"
5750,BOOK VIII.,Then in our court indulge the genial hour.
5751,BOOK VIII.,"Instant, you sailors to this task attend;"
5752,BOOK VIII.,"Swift to the palace, all ye peers ascend;"
5753,BOOK VIII.,Let none to strangers honours due disclaim:

5755,BOOK VIII.,"Taught by the gods to please, when high he sings"
5756,BOOK VIII.,"The vocal lay, responsive to the strings.”"
5757,BOOK VIII.,
5758,BOOK VIII.,Thus spoke the prince; the attending peers obey;
5759,BOOK VIII.,In state they move; Alcinous heads the way
5760,BOOK VIII.,"Swift to Demodocus the herald flies,"
5761,BOOK VIII.,At once the sailors to their charge arise;
5762,BOOK VIII.,"They launch the vessel, and unfurl the sails,"
5763,BOOK VIII.,And stretch the swelling canvas to the gales;
5764,BOOK VIII.,"Then to the palace move: a gathering throng,"
5765,BOOK VIII.,"Youth, and white age, tumultuous pour along."
5766,BOOK VIII.,Now all accesses to the dome are fill’d;
5767,BOOK VIII.,"Eight boars, the choicest of the herd, are kill’d;"

5770,BOOK VIII.,"The herald now arrives, and guides along"

5772,BOOK VIII.,Dear to the Muse! who gave his days to flow
5773,BOOK VIII.,"With mighty blessings, mix’d with mighty woe;"
5774,BOOK VIII.,"With clouds of darkness quench’d his visual ray,"
5775,BOOK VIII.,But gave him skill to raise the lofty lay.
5776,BOOK VIII.,"High on a radiant throne sublime in state,"
5777,BOOK VIII.,"Encircled by huge multitudes, he sate;"
5778,BOOK VIII.,"With silver shone the throne; his lyre, well strung"
5779,BOOK VIII.,"To rapturous sounds, at hand Poutonous hung."
5780,BOOK VIII.,"Before his seat a polish’d table shines,"
5781,BOOK VIII.,And a full goblet foams with generous wines;
5782,BOOK VIII.,His food a herald bore; and now they fed;
5783,BOOK VIII.,And now the rage of craving hunger fled.
5784,BOOK VIII.,
5785,BOOK VIII.,"Then, fired by all the Muse, aloud he sings"
5786,BOOK VIII.,The mighty deeds of demigods and kings;
5787,BOOK VIII.,"From that fierce wrath the noble song arose,"
5788,BOOK VIII.,That made Ulysses and Achilles foes;
5789,BOOK VIII.,How o’er the feast they doom the fall of Troy;
5790,BOOK VIII.,The stern debate Atrides hears with joy;
5791,BOOK VIII.,"For Heaven foretold the contest, when he trod"
5792,BOOK VIII.,"The marble threshold of the Delphic god,"
5793,BOOK VIII.,"Curious to learn the counsels of the sky,"
5794,BOOK VIII.,Ere yet he loosed the rage of war on Troy.
5795,BOOK VIII.,
5796,BOOK VIII.,"Touch’d at the song, Ulysses straight resign’d"
5797,BOOK VIII.,To soft affliction all his manly mind.
5798,BOOK VIII.,"Before his eyes the purple vest he drew,"
5799,BOOK VIII.,Industrious to conceal the falling dew;
5800,BOOK VIII.,"But when the music paused, he ceased to shed"
5801,BOOK VIII.,"The flowing tear, and raised his drooping head;"
5802,BOOK VIII.,"And, lifting to the gods a goblet crown’d,"
5803,BOOK VIII.,He pour’d a pure libation to the ground.
5804,BOOK VIII.,
5805,BOOK VIII.,"Transported with the song, the listening train"
5806,BOOK VIII.,Again with loud applause demand the strain;
5807,BOOK VIII.,Again Ulysses veil’d his pensive head.
5808,BOOK VIII.,"Again unmann’d, a shower of sorrows shed;"
5809,BOOK VIII.,Conceal’d he wept; the king observed alone
5810,BOOK VIII.,"The silent tear, and heard the secret groan;"
5811,BOOK VIII.,"Then to the bard aloud—“O cease to sing,"
5812,BOOK VIII.,Dumb be thy voice and mute the harmonious string;
5813,BOOK VIII.,"Enough the feast has pleased, enough the power"
5814,BOOK VIII.,Of heavenly song has crown’d the genial hour!
5815,BOOK VIII.,"Incessant in the games your strength display,"
5816,BOOK VIII.,"Contest, ye brave the honours of the day!"
5817,BOOK VIII.,That pleased the admiring stranger may proclaim
5818,BOOK VIII.,In distant regions the Phæacian fame:
5819,BOOK VIII.,"None wield the gauntlet with so dire a sway,"
5820,BOOK VIII.,Or swifter in the race devour the way;
5821,BOOK VIII.,"None in the leap spring with so strong a bound,"
5822,BOOK VIII.,"Or firmer, in the wrestling, press the ground.”"
5823,BOOK VIII.,
5824,BOOK VIII.,Thus spoke the king; the attending peers obey;
5825,BOOK VIII.,"In state they move, Alcinous lends the way;"
5826,BOOK VIII.,"His golden lyre Demodocus unstrung,"
5827,BOOK VIII.,High on a column in the palace hung;
5828,BOOK VIII.,"And guided by a herald’s guardian cares,"
5829,BOOK VIII.,Majestic to the lists of Fame repairs.
5830,BOOK VIII.,
5831,BOOK VIII.,"Now swarms the populace: a countless throng,"
5832,BOOK VIII.,Youth and hoar age; and man drives man along.
5833,BOOK VIII.,"The games begin; ambitious of the prize,"
5834,BOOK VIII.,"Acroneus, Thoon, and Eretmeus rise;"
5835,BOOK VIII.,"The prize Ocyalus and Prymneus claim,"
5836,BOOK VIII.,"Anchialus and Ponteus, chiefs of fame."
5837,BOOK VIII.,"There Proreus, Nautes, Eratreus, appear"
5838,BOOK VIII.,"And famed Amphialus, Polyneus’ heir;"
5839,BOOK VIII.,"Euryalus, like Mars terrific, rose,"
5840,BOOK VIII.,When clad in wrath he withers hosts of foes;
5841,BOOK VIII.,"Naubolides with grace unequall’d shone,"
5842,BOOK VIII.,Or equall’d by Laodamas alone.
5843,BOOK VIII.,With these came forth Ambasineus the strong:
5844,BOOK VIII.,"And three brave sons, from great Alcinous sprung."
5845,BOOK VIII.,
5846,BOOK VIII.,"Ranged in a line the ready racers stand,"
5847,BOOK VIII.,"Start from the goal, and vanish o’er the strand:"
5848,BOOK VIII.,"Swift as on wings of winds, upborne they fly,"
5849,BOOK VIII.,And drifts of rising dust involve the sky.
5850,BOOK VIII.,"Before the rest, what space the hinds allow"
5851,BOOK VIII.,"Between the mule and ox, from plough to plough,"
5852,BOOK VIII.,"Clytonius sprung: he wing’d the rapid way,"
5853,BOOK VIII.,And bore the unrivall’d honours of the day.
5854,BOOK VIII.,With fierce embrace the brawny wrestlers join;
5855,BOOK VIII.,"The conquest, great Euryalus, is thine."
5856,BOOK VIII.,"Amphialus sprung forward with a bound,"
5857,BOOK VIII.,"Superior in the leap, a length of ground."
5858,BOOK VIII.,"From Elatreus’ strong arm the discus flies,"
5859,BOOK VIII.,And sings with unmatch’d force along the skies.
5860,BOOK VIII.,"And Laodam whirls high, with dreadful sway,"
5861,BOOK VIII.,"The gloves of death, victorious in the fray."
5862,BOOK VIII.,
5863,BOOK VIII.,"While thus the peerage in the games contends,"
5864,BOOK VIII.,"In act to speak, Laodamas ascends."
5865,BOOK VIII.,
5866,BOOK VIII.,"“O friends (he cries), the stranger seems well skill’d"
5867,BOOK VIII.,To try the illustrious labours of the field:
5868,BOOK VIII.,"I deem him brave: then grant the brave man’s claim,"
5869,BOOK VIII.,Invite the hero to his share of fame.
5870,BOOK VIII.,What nervous arms he boasts! how firm his tread!
5871,BOOK VIII.,His limbs how turn’d! how broad his shoulders spread!
5872,BOOK VIII.,By age unbroke!—but all-consuming care
5873,BOOK VIII.,Destroys perhaps the strength that time would spare:
5874,BOOK VIII.,"Dire is the ocean, dread in all its forms!"
5875,BOOK VIII.,Man must decay when man contends with storms.”
5876,BOOK VIII.,
5877,BOOK VIII.,“Well hast thou spoke (Euryalus replies):
5878,BOOK VIII.,"Thine is the guest, invite him thou to rise.”"
5879,BOOK VIII.,"Swift as the word, advancing from the crowd,"
5880,BOOK VIII.,"He made obeisance, and thus spoke aloud:"
5881,BOOK VIII.,
5882,BOOK VIII.,“Vouchsafes the reverend stranger to display
5883,BOOK VIII.,"His manly worth, and share the glorious day?"
5884,BOOK VIII.,"Father, arise! for thee thy port proclaims"
5885,BOOK VIII.,Expert to conquer in the solemn games.
5886,BOOK VIII.,To fame arise! for what more fame can yield
5887,BOOK VIII.,"Than the swift race, or conflict of the field?"
5888,BOOK VIII.,"Steal from corroding care one transient day,"
5889,BOOK VIII.,To glory give the space thou hast to stay;
5890,BOOK VIII.,"Short is the time, and lo! e’en now the gales"
5891,BOOK VIII.,"Call thee aboard, and stretch the swelling sails.”"
5892,BOOK VIII.,
5893,BOOK VIII.,To whom with sighs Ulysses gave reply:
5894,BOOK VIII.,“Ah why the ill-suiting pastime must I try?
5895,BOOK VIII.,To gloomy care my thoughts alone are free;
5896,BOOK VIII.,Ill the gay sports with troubled hearts agree;
5897,BOOK VIII.,"Sad from my natal hour my days have ran,"
5898,BOOK VIII.,"A much-afflicted, much-enduring man!"
5899,BOOK VIII.,"Who, suppliant to the king and peers, implores"
5900,BOOK VIII.,A speedy voyage to his native shore.”
5901,BOOK VIII.,
5902,BOOK VIII.,"“Wide wanders, Laodam, thy erring tongue"
5903,BOOK VIII.,The sports of glory to the brave belong
5904,BOOK VIII.,(Retorts Euryalus): he bears no claim
5905,BOOK VIII.,"Among the great, unlike the sons of Fame."
5906,BOOK VIII.,A wandering merchant he frequents the main
5907,BOOK VIII.,Some mean seafarer in pursuit of gain;
5908,BOOK VIII.,"Studious of freight, in naval trade well skill’d,"
5909,BOOK VIII.,But dreads the athletic labours of the field.”
5910,BOOK VIII.,
5911,BOOK VIII.,"Incensed, Ulysses with a frown replies:"
5912,BOOK VIII.,“O forward to proclaim thy soul unwise!
5913,BOOK VIII.,With partial hands the gods their gifts dispense;
5914,BOOK VIII.,"Some greatly think, some speak with manly sense;"
5915,BOOK VIII.,"Here Heaven an elegance of form denies,"
5916,BOOK VIII.,But wisdom the defect of form supplies;
5917,BOOK VIII.,"This man with energy of thought controls,"
5918,BOOK VIII.,And steals with modest violence our souls;
5919,BOOK VIII.,"He speaks reservedly, but he speaks with force,"
5920,BOOK VIII.,Nor can one word be changed but for a worse;
5921,BOOK VIII.,"In public more than mortal he appears,"
5922,BOOK VIII.,"And as he moves, the praising crowd reveres;"
5923,BOOK VIII.,"While others, beauteous as the etherial kind,"
5924,BOOK VIII.,"The nobler portion went, a knowing mind,"
5925,BOOK VIII.,In outward show Heaven gives thee to excel.
5926,BOOK VIII.,But Heaven denies the praise of thinking well
5927,BOOK VIII.,"I’ll bear the brave a rude ungovern’d tongue,"
5928,BOOK VIII.,"And, youth, my generous soul resents the wrong."
5929,BOOK VIII.,"Skill’d in heroic exercise, I claim"
5930,BOOK VIII.,A post of honour with the sons of Fame.
5931,BOOK VIII.,"Such was my boast while vigour crown’d my days,"
5932,BOOK VIII.,"Now care surrounds me, and my force decays;"
5933,BOOK VIII.,Inured a melancholy part to bear
5934,BOOK VIII.,"In scenes of death, by tempest and by war"
5935,BOOK VIII.,"Yet thus by woes impair’d, no more I waive"
5936,BOOK VIII.,To prove the hero—slander stings the brave.”
5937,BOOK VIII.,
5938,BOOK VIII.,Then gliding forward with a furious bound
5939,BOOK VIII.,He wrench’d a rocky fragment from the ground
5940,BOOK VIII.,"By far more ponderous, and more huge by far"
5941,BOOK VIII.,Than what Phæacia’s sons discharged in air.
5942,BOOK VIII.,Fierce from his arm the enormous load he flings;
5943,BOOK VIII.,Sonorous through the shaded air it sings;
5944,BOOK VIII.,"Couch’d to the earth, tempestuous as it flies,"
5945,BOOK VIII.,The crowd gaze upward while it cleaves the skies.
5946,BOOK VIII.,"Beyond all marks, with many a giddy round"
5947,BOOK VIII.,"Down-rushing, it up-turns a hill of ground."
5948,BOOK VIII.,
5949,BOOK VIII.,"That Instant Pallas, bursting from a cloud,"
5950,BOOK VIII.,"Fix’d a distinguish’d mark, and cried aloud:"
5951,BOOK VIII.,
5952,BOOK VIII.,"“E’en he who, sightless, wants his visual ray"
5953,BOOK VIII.,May by his touch alone award the day:
5954,BOOK VIII.,Thy signal throw transcends the utmost bound
5955,BOOK VIII.,Of every champion by a length of ground:
5956,BOOK VIII.,Securely bid the strongest of the train
5957,BOOK VIII.,Arise to throw; the strongest throws in vain.”
5958,BOOK VIII.,
5959,BOOK VIII.,She spoke: and momentary mounts the sky:
5960,BOOK VIII.,The friendly voice Ulysses hears with joy.
5961,BOOK VIII.,Then thus aloud (elate with decent pride)
5962,BOOK VIII.,"“Rise, ye Phæacians, try your force (he cried):"
5963,BOOK VIII.,"If with this throw the strongest caster vie,"
5964,BOOK VIII.,"Still, further still, I bid the discus fly."
5965,BOOK VIII.,"Stand forth, ye champions, who the gauntlet wield,"
5966,BOOK VIII.,"Or ye, the swiftest racers of the field!"
5967,BOOK VIII.,"Stand forth, ye wrestlers, who these pastimes grace!"
5968,BOOK VIII.,"I wield the gauntlet, and I run the race."
5969,BOOK VIII.,"In such heroic games I yield to none,"
5970,BOOK VIII.,Or yield to brave Laodamas alone:
5971,BOOK VIII.,Shall I with brave Laodamas contend?
5972,BOOK VIII.,"A friend is sacred, and I style him friend."
5973,BOOK VIII.,"Ungenerous were the man, and base of heart,"
5974,BOOK VIII.,"Who takes the kind, and pays the ungrateful part:"
5975,BOOK VIII.,"Chiefly the man, in foreign realms confined,"
5976,BOOK VIII.,"Base to his friend, to his own interest blind:"
5977,BOOK VIII.,"All, all your heroes I this day defy;"
5978,BOOK VIII.,Give me a man that we our might may try.
5979,BOOK VIII.,"Expert in every art, I boast the skill"
5980,BOOK VIII.,To give the feather’d arrow wings to kill;
5981,BOOK VIII.,"Should a whole host at once discharge the bow,"
5982,BOOK VIII.,My well-aim’d shaft with death prevents the foe:
5983,BOOK VIII.,"Alone superior in the field of Troy,"
5984,BOOK VIII.,Great Philoctetes taught the shaft to fly.
5985,BOOK VIII.,From all the sons of earth unrivall’d praise
5986,BOOK VIII.,"I justly claim; but yield to better days,"
5987,BOOK VIII.,"To those famed days when great Alcides rose,"
5988,BOOK VIII.,"And Eurytus, who bade the gods be foes"
5989,BOOK VIII.,"(Vain Eurytus, whose art became his crime,"
5990,BOOK VIII.,"Swept from the earth, he perish’d in his prime:"
5991,BOOK VIII.,"Sudden the irremeable way he trod,"
5992,BOOK VIII.,Who boldly durst defy the bowyer god).
5993,BOOK VIII.,In fighting fields as far the spear I throw
5994,BOOK VIII.,As flies an arrow from the well-drawn bow.
5995,BOOK VIII.,"Sole in the race the contest I decline,"
5996,BOOK VIII.,"Stiff are my weary joints, and I resign;"
5997,BOOK VIII.,"By storms and hunger worn; age well may fail,"
5998,BOOK VIII.,When storms and hunger doth at once assail.”
5999,BOOK VIII.,
6000,BOOK VIII.,"Abash’d, the numbers hear the godlike man,"
6001,BOOK VIII.,Till great Alcinous mildly thus began:
6002,BOOK VIII.,
6003,BOOK VIII.,"“Well hast thou spoke, and well thy generous tongue"
6004,BOOK VIII.,With decent pride refutes a public wrong:
6005,BOOK VIII.,"Warm are thy words, but warm without offence;"
6006,BOOK VIII.,"Fear only fools, secure in men of sense;"
6007,BOOK VIII.,"Thy worth is known. Then hear our country’s claim,"
6008,BOOK VIII.,And bear to heroes our heroic fame:
6009,BOOK VIII.,"In distant realms our glorious deeds display,"
6010,BOOK VIII.,Repeat them frequent in the genial day;
6011,BOOK VIII.,"When, blest with ease, thy woes and wanderings end,"
6012,BOOK VIII.,"Teach them thy consort, bid thy sons attend;"
6013,BOOK VIII.,"How, loved of Jove, he crown’d our sires with praise,"
6014,BOOK VIII.,How we their offspring dignify our race.
6015,BOOK VIII.,
6016,BOOK VIII.,"“Let other realms the deathful gauntlet wield,"
6017,BOOK VIII.,Or boast the glories of the athletic field:
6018,BOOK VIII.,"We in the course unrivall’d speed display,"
6019,BOOK VIII.,Or through cerulean billows plough the way;
6020,BOOK VIII.,"To dress, to dance, to sing, our sole delight,"
6021,BOOK VIII.,"The feast or bath by day, and love by night:"
6022,BOOK VIII.,"Rise, then, ye skill’d in measures; let him bear"
6023,BOOK VIII.,Your fame to men that breathe a distant air;
6024,BOOK VIII.,"And faithful say, to you the powers belong"
6025,BOOK VIII.,"To race, to sail, to dance, to chant the song."
6026,BOOK VIII.,
6027,BOOK VIII.,"“But, herald, to the palace swift repair,"
6028,BOOK VIII.,And the soft lyre to grace our pastimes bear.”
6029,BOOK VIII.,
6030,BOOK VIII.,"Swift at the word, obedient to the king,"
6031,BOOK VIII.,The herald flies the tuneful lyre to bring.
6032,BOOK VIII.,"Up rose nine seniors, chosen to survey"
6033,BOOK VIII.,"The future games, the judges of the day"
6034,BOOK VIII.,With instant care they mark a spacious round
6035,BOOK VIII.,And level for the dance the allotted ground:
6036,BOOK VIII.,"The herald bears the lyre: intent to play,"
6037,BOOK VIII.,The bard advancing meditates the lay.
6038,BOOK VIII.,"Skill’d in the dance, tall youths, a blooming band,"
6039,BOOK VIII.,Graceful before the heavenly minstrel stand:
6040,BOOK VIII.,"Light bounding from the earth, at once they rise,"
6041,BOOK VIII.,Their feet half-viewless quiver in the skies:
6042,BOOK VIII.,"Ulysses gazed, astonish’d to survey"
6043,BOOK VIII.,The glancing splendours as their sandals play.
6044,BOOK VIII.,"Meantime the bard, alternate to the strings,"
6045,BOOK VIII.,The loves of Mars and Cytherea sings:
6046,BOOK VIII.,"How the stern god, enamour’d with her charms"
6047,BOOK VIII.,"Clasp’d the gay panting goddess in his arms,"
6048,BOOK VIII.,"By bribes seduced; and how the sun, whose eye"
6049,BOOK VIII.,"Views the broad heavens, disclosed the lawless joy."
6050,BOOK VIII.,"Stung to the soul, indignant through the skies"
6051,BOOK VIII.,To his black forge vindictive Vulcan flies:
6052,BOOK VIII.,"Arrived, his sinewy arms incessant place"
6053,BOOK VIII.,The eternal anvil on the massy base.
6054,BOOK VIII.,"A wondrous net he labours, to betray"
6055,BOOK VIII.,"The wanton lovers, as entwined they lay,"
6056,BOOK VIII.,Indissolubly strong; Then instant bears
6057,BOOK VIII.,To his immortal dome the finish’d snares:
6058,BOOK VIII.,"Above, below, around, with art dispread,"
6059,BOOK VIII.,The sure inclosure folds the genial bed:
6060,BOOK VIII.,"Whose texture even the search of gods deceives,"
6061,BOOK VIII.,"Thin as the filmy threads the spider weaves,"
6062,BOOK VIII.,"Then, as withdrawing from the starry bowers,"
6063,BOOK VIII.,"He feigns a journey to the Lemnian shores,"
6064,BOOK VIII.,His favourite isle: observant Mars descries
6065,BOOK VIII.,"His wish’d recess, and to the goddess flies;"
6066,BOOK VIII.,"He glows, he burns, the fair-hair’d queen of love"
6067,BOOK VIII.,"Descends, smooth gliding from the courts of Jove,"
6068,BOOK VIII.,Gay blooming in full charms: her hand he press’d
6069,BOOK VIII.,"With eager joy, and with a sigh address’d:"
6070,BOOK VIII.,
6071,BOOK VIII.,"“Come, my beloved! and taste the soft delights:"
6072,BOOK VIII.,"Come, to repose the genial bed invites:"
6073,BOOK VIII.,"Thy absent spouse, neglectful of thy charms,"
6074,BOOK VIII.,Prefers his barbarous Sintians to thy arms!”
6075,BOOK VIII.,
6076,BOOK VIII.,"Then, nothing loth, the enamour’d fair he led,"
6077,BOOK VIII.,And sunk transported on the conscious bed.
6078,BOOK VIII.,"Down rush’d the toils, inwrapping as they lay"
6079,BOOK VIII.,The careless lovers in their wanton play:
6080,BOOK VIII.,In vain they strive; the entangling snares deny
6081,BOOK VIII.,(Inextricably firm) the power to fly.
6082,BOOK VIII.,"Warn’d by the god who sheds the golden day,"
6083,BOOK VIII.,Stern Vulcan homeward treads the starry way:
6084,BOOK VIII.,"Arrived, he sees, he grieves, with rage he burns:"
6085,BOOK VIII.,"Full horribly he roars, his voice all heaven returns."
6086,BOOK VIII.,
6087,BOOK VIII.,"“O Jove (he cried) O all ye powers above,"
6088,BOOK VIII.,See the lewd dalliance of the queen of love!
6089,BOOK VIII.,"Me, awkward me, she scorns; and yields her charms"
6090,BOOK VIII.,"To that fair lecher, the strong god of arms."
6091,BOOK VIII.,"If I am lame, that stain my natal hour"
6092,BOOK VIII.,By fate imposed; such me my parent bore.
6093,BOOK VIII.,Why was I born? See how the wanton lies!
6094,BOOK VIII.,Oh sight tormenting to a husband’s eyes!
6095,BOOK VIII.,"But yet, I trust, this once e’en Mars would fly"
6096,BOOK VIII.,"His fair-one’s arms—he thinks her, once, too nigh."
6097,BOOK VIII.,"But there remain, ye guilty, in my power,"
6098,BOOK VIII.,Till Jove refunds his shameless daughter’s dower.
6099,BOOK VIII.,Too dear I prized a fair enchanting face:
6100,BOOK VIII.,Beauty unchaste is beauty in disgrace.”
6101,BOOK VIII.,
6102,BOOK VIII.,Meanwhile the gods the dome of Vulcan throng;
6103,BOOK VIII.,"Apollo comes, and Neptune comes along;"
6104,BOOK VIII.,With these gay Hermes trod the starry plain;
6105,BOOK VIII.,But modesty withheld the goddess train.
6106,BOOK VIII.,"All heaven beholds, imprison’d as they lie,"
6107,BOOK VIII.,And unextinguish’d laughter shakes the sky.
6108,BOOK VIII.,"Then mutual, thus they spoke: “Behold on wrong"
6109,BOOK VIII.,Swift vengeance waits; and art subdues the strong!
6110,BOOK VIII.,Dwells there a god on all the Olympian brow
6111,BOOK VIII.,"More swift than Mars, and more than Vulcan slow?"
6112,BOOK VIII.,"Yet Vulcan conquers, and the god of arms"
6113,BOOK VIII.,Must pay the penalty for lawless charms.”
6114,BOOK VIII.,
6115,BOOK VIII.,"Thus serious they; but he who gilds the skies,"
6116,BOOK VIII.,"The gay Apollo, thus to Hermes cries:"
6117,BOOK VIII.,"“Wouldst thou enchain’d like Mars, O Hermes, lie"
6118,BOOK VIII.,And bear the shame like Mars to share the joy?”
6119,BOOK VIII.,
6120,BOOK VIII.,“O envied shame! (the smiling youth rejoin’d;)
6121,BOOK VIII.,"And thrice the chains, and thrice more firmly bind;"
6122,BOOK VIII.,"Gaze all ye gods, and every goddess gaze,"
6123,BOOK VIII.,Yet eager would I bless the sweet disgrace.”
6124,BOOK VIII.,
6125,BOOK VIII.,"Loud laugh the rest, e’en Neptune laughs aloud,"
6126,BOOK VIII.,Yet sues importunate to loose the god.
6127,BOOK VIII.,"“And free, (he cries) O Vulcan! free from shame"
6128,BOOK VIII.,Thy captives; I ensure the penal claim.”
6129,BOOK VIII.,
6130,BOOK VIII.,“Will Neptune (Vulcan then) the faithless trust?
6131,BOOK VIII.,He suffers who gives surety for the unjust:
6132,BOOK VIII.,"But say, if that lewd scandal of the sky,"
6133,BOOK VIII.,"To liberty restored, perfidious fly:"
6134,BOOK VIII.,"Say, wilt thou bear the mulct?” He instant cries,"
6135,BOOK VIII.,"“The mulct I bear, if Mars perfidious flies.”"
6136,BOOK VIII.,
6137,BOOK VIII.,To whom appeased: “No more I urge delay;
6138,BOOK VIII.,"When Neptune sues, my part is to obey.”"
6139,BOOK VIII.,Then to the snares his force the god applies;
6140,BOOK VIII.,They burst; and Mars to Thrace indignant flies:
6141,BOOK VIII.,"To the soft Cyprian shores the goddess moves,"
6142,BOOK VIII.,"To visit Paphos and her blooming groves,"
6143,BOOK VIII.,"Where to the Power an hundred altars rise,"
6144,BOOK VIII.,And breathing odours scent the balmy skies;
6145,BOOK VIII.,"Concealed she bathes in consecrated bowers,"
6146,BOOK VIII.,"The Graces unguents shed, ambrosial showers,"
6147,BOOK VIII.,Unguents that charm the gods! she last assumes
6148,BOOK VIII.,Her wondrous robes; and full the goddess blooms.
6149,BOOK VIII.,
6150,BOOK VIII.,"Thus sung the bard: Ulysses hears with joy,"
6151,BOOK VIII.,And loud applauses read the vaulted sky.
6152,BOOK VIII.,
6153,BOOK VIII.,"Then to the sports his sons the king commands,"
6154,BOOK VIII.,"Each blooming youth before the monarch stands,"
6155,BOOK VIII.,In dance unmatch’d! A wondrous ball is brought
6156,BOOK VIII.,"(The work of Polypus, divinely wrought);"
6157,BOOK VIII.,"This youth with strength enormous bids it fly,"
6158,BOOK VIII.,And bending backward whirls it to the sky;
6159,BOOK VIII.,"His brother, springing with an active bound,"
6160,BOOK VIII.,At distance intercepts it from the ground.
6161,BOOK VIII.,"The ball dismissed, in dance they skim the strand,"
6162,BOOK VIII.,"Turn and return, and scarce imprint the sand."
6163,BOOK VIII.,"The assembly gazes with astonished eyes,"
6164,BOOK VIII.,And sends in shouts applauses to the skies.
6165,BOOK VIII.,
6166,BOOK VIII.,"Then thus Ulysses: “Happy king, whose name"
6167,BOOK VIII.,The brightest shines in all the rolls of fame!
6168,BOOK VIII.,In subjects happy with surprise I gaze;
6169,BOOK VIII.,Thy praise was just; their skill transcends thy praise.”
6170,BOOK VIII.,
6171,BOOK VIII.,"Pleas’d with his people’s fame, the monarch hears,"
6172,BOOK VIII.,And thus benevolent accosts the peers:
6173,BOOK VIII.,"“Since wisdom’s sacred guidance he pursues,"
6174,BOOK VIII.,Give to the stranger-guest a stranger’s dues:
6175,BOOK VIII.,"Twelve princes in our realm dominion share,"
6176,BOOK VIII.,"O’er whom supreme, imperial power I bear;"
6177,BOOK VIII.,"Bring gold, a pledge of love: a talent bring,"
6178,BOOK VIII.,"A vest, a robe, and imitate your king."
6179,BOOK VIII.,Be swift to give: that he this night may share
6180,BOOK VIII.,"The social feast of joy, with joy sincere."
6181,BOOK VIII.,"And thou, Euryalus, redeem thy wrong;"
6182,BOOK VIII.,A generous heart repairs a slanderous tongue.”
6183,BOOK VIII.,
6184,BOOK VIII.,"The assenting peers, obedient to the king,"
6185,BOOK VIII.,In haste their heralds send the gifts to bring.
6186,BOOK VIII.,"Then thus Euryalus: “O prince, whose sway"
6187,BOOK VIII.,"Rules this bless’d realm, repentant I obey;"
6188,BOOK VIII.,"Be his this sword, whose blade of brass displays"
6189,BOOK VIII.,A ruddy gleam; whose hilt a silver blaze;
6190,BOOK VIII.,"Whose ivory sheath, inwrought with curious pride,"
6191,BOOK VIII.,Adds graceful terror to the wearer’s side.”
6192,BOOK VIII.,
6193,BOOK VIII.,"He said, and to his hand the sword consign’d:"
6194,BOOK VIII.,"“And if (he cried) my words affect thy mind,"
6195,BOOK VIII.,"Far from thy mind those words, ye whirlwinds, bear,"
6196,BOOK VIII.,"And scatter them, ye storms, in empty air!"
6197,BOOK VIII.,"Crown, O ye heavens, with joy his peaceful hours,"
6198,BOOK VIII.,"And grant him to his spouse, and native shores.”"
6199,BOOK VIII.,
6200,BOOK VIII.,"“And blest be thou, my friend, (Ulysses cries,)"
6201,BOOK VIII.,"Crown him with every joy, ye favouring skies"
6202,BOOK VIII.,"To thy calm hours continued peace afford,"
6203,BOOK VIII.,"And never, never mayst thou want this sword,”"
6204,BOOK VIII.,
6205,BOOK VIII.,"He said, and o’er his shoulder flung the blade."
6206,BOOK VIII.,Now o’er the earth ascends the evening shade:
6207,BOOK VIII.,"The precious gifts the illustrious heralds bear,"
6208,BOOK VIII.,And to the court the embodied peers repair.
6209,BOOK VIII.,Before the queen Alcinous’ sons unfold
6210,BOOK VIII.,"The vests, the robes, and heaps of shining gold;"
6211,BOOK VIII.,Then to the radiant thrones they move in state:
6212,BOOK VIII.,"Aloft, the king in pomp imperial sate."
6213,BOOK VIII.,
6214,BOOK VIII.,"Thence to the queen: “O partner of our reign,"
6215,BOOK VIII.,O sole beloved! command thy menial train
6216,BOOK VIII.,"A polish’d chest and stately robes to bear,"
6217,BOOK VIII.,And healing waters for the bath prepare;
6218,BOOK VIII.,"That, bathed, our guest may bid his sorrows cease,"
6219,BOOK VIII.,"Hear the sweet song, and taste the feast in peace."
6220,BOOK VIII.,"A bowl that flames with gold, of wondrous frame,"
6221,BOOK VIII.,"Ourself we give, memorial of our name;"
6222,BOOK VIII.,"To raise in offerings to almighty Jove,"
6223,BOOK VIII.,And every god that treads the courts above.”
6224,BOOK VIII.,
6225,BOOK VIII.,"Instant the queen, observant of the king,"
6226,BOOK VIII.,"Commands her train a spacious vase to bring,"
6227,BOOK VIII.,"The spacious vase with ample streams suffice,"
6228,BOOK VIII.,"Heap the high wood, and bid the flames arise."
6229,BOOK VIII.,"The flames climb round it with a fierce embrace,"
6230,BOOK VIII.,The fuming waters bubble o’er the blaze.
6231,BOOK VIII.,Herself the chest prepares; in order roll’d
6232,BOOK VIII.,"The robes, the vests are ranged, and heaps of gold"
6233,BOOK VIII.,"And adding a rich dress inwrought with art,"
6234,BOOK VIII.,A gift expressive of her bounteous heart.
6235,BOOK VIII.,Thus spoke to Ithacus: “To guard with bands
6236,BOOK VIII.,"Insolvable these gifts, thy care demands;"
6237,BOOK VIII.,"Lest, in thy slumbers on the watery main,"
6238,BOOK VIII.,The hand of rapine make our bounty vain.”
6239,BOOK VIII.,
6240,BOOK VIII.,Then bending with full force around he roll’d
6241,BOOK VIII.,"A labyrinth of bands in fold on fold,"
6242,BOOK VIII.,Closed with Circaean art. A train attends
6243,BOOK VIII.,Around the bath: the bath the king ascends
6244,BOOK VIII.,"(Untasted joy, since that disastrous hour,"
6245,BOOK VIII.,He sail’d ill-fated from Calypso’s bower);
6246,BOOK VIII.,"Where, happy as the gods that range the sky,"
6247,BOOK VIII.,He feasted every sense with every joy.
6248,BOOK VIII.,"He bathes; the damsels with officious toil,"
6249,BOOK VIII.,"Shed sweets, shed unguents, in a shower of oil;"
6250,BOOK VIII.,"Then o’er his limbs a gorgeous robe he spreads,"
6251,BOOK VIII.,And to the feast magnificently treads.
6252,BOOK VIII.,"Full where the dome its shining valves expands,"
6253,BOOK VIII.,Nausicaa blooming as a goddess stands;
6254,BOOK VIII.,"With wondering eyes the hero she survey’d,"
6255,BOOK VIII.,And graceful thus began the royal maid:
6256,BOOK VIII.,
6257,BOOK VIII.,"“Hail, godlike stranger! and when heaven restores"
6258,BOOK VIII.,"To thy fond wish thy long-expected shores,"
6259,BOOK VIII.,This ever grateful in remembrance bear:
6260,BOOK VIII.,"To me thou owest, to me, the vital air.”"
6261,BOOK VIII.,
6262,BOOK VIII.,“O royal maid! (Ulysses straight returns)
6263,BOOK VIII.,"Whose worth the splendours of thy race adorns,"
6264,BOOK VIII.,So may dread Jove (whose arm in vengeance forms
6265,BOOK VIII.,"The writhen bolt, and blackens heaven with storms),"
6266,BOOK VIII.,"Restore me safe, through weary wanderings toss’d,"
6267,BOOK VIII.,"To my dear country’s ever-pleasing coast,"
6268,BOOK VIII.,"As while the spirit in this bosom glows,"
6269,BOOK VIII.,"To thee, my goddess, I address my vows;"
6270,BOOK VIII.,"My life, thy gift I boast!” He said, and sate"
6271,BOOK VIII.,Fast by Alcinous on a throne of state.
6272,BOOK VIII.,
6273,BOOK VIII.,"Now each partakes the feast, the wine prepares,"
6274,BOOK VIII.,"Portions the food, and each his portion shares."
6275,BOOK VIII.,The bard a herald guides; the gazing throng
6276,BOOK VIII.,Pay low obeisance as he moves along:
6277,BOOK VIII.,"Beneath a sculptur’d arch he sits enthroned,"
6278,BOOK VIII.,The peers encircling form an awful round.
6279,BOOK VIII.,"Then, from the chine, Ulysses carves with art"
6280,BOOK VIII.,"Delicious food, an honorary part:"
6281,BOOK VIII.,"“This, let the master of the lyre receive,"
6282,BOOK VIII.,A pledge of love! ’tis all a wretch can give.
6283,BOOK VIII.,Lives there a man beneath the spacious skies
6284,BOOK VIII.,Who sacred honours to the bard denies?
6285,BOOK VIII.,"The Muse the bard inspires, exalts his mind;"
6286,BOOK VIII.,The muse indulgent loves the harmonious kind.”
6287,BOOK VIII.,
6288,BOOK VIII.,"The herald to his hand the charge conveys,"
6289,BOOK VIII.,"Not fond of flattery, nor unpleased with praise."
6290,BOOK VIII.,
6291,BOOK VIII.,"When now the rage of hunger was allay’d,"
6292,BOOK VIII.,Thus to the lyrist wise Ulysses said:
6293,BOOK VIII.,"“O more than man! thy soul the muse inspires,"
6294,BOOK VIII.,Or Phœbus animates with all his fires;
6295,BOOK VIII.,"For who, by Phœbus uninform’d, could know"
6296,BOOK VIII.,"The woe of Greece, and sing so well the woe?"
6297,BOOK VIII.,"Just to the tale, as present at the fray,"
6298,BOOK VIII.,Or taught the labours of the dreadful day:
6299,BOOK VIII.,"The song recalls past horrors to my eyes,"
6300,BOOK VIII.,And bids proud Ilion from her ashes rise.
6301,BOOK VIII.,"Once more harmonious strike the sounding string,"
6302,BOOK VIII.,"The Epaean fabric, framed by Pallas, sing:"
6303,BOOK VIII.,"How stern Ulysses, furious to destroy,"
6304,BOOK VIII.,With latent heroes sack’d imperial Troy.
6305,BOOK VIII.,"If faithful thou record the tale of Fame,"
6306,BOOK VIII.,The god himself inspires thy breast with flame
6307,BOOK VIII.,And mine shall be the task henceforth to raise
6308,BOOK VIII.,In every land thy monument of praise.”
6309,BOOK VIII.,
6310,BOOK VIII.,Full of the god he raised his lofty strain:
6311,BOOK VIII.,How the Greeks rush’d tumultuous to the main;
6312,BOOK VIII.,"How blazing tents illumined half the skies,"
6313,BOOK VIII.,While from the shores the winged navy flies;
6314,BOOK VIII.,"How e’en in Ilion’s walls, in deathful bands,"
6315,BOOK VIII.,Came the stern Greeks by Troy’s assisting hands:
6316,BOOK VIII.,"All Troy up-heaved the steed; of differing mind,"
6317,BOOK VIII.,Various the Trojans counsell’d: part consign’d
6318,BOOK VIII.,"The monster to the sword, part sentence gave"
6319,BOOK VIII.,To plunge it headlong in the whelming wave;
6320,BOOK VIII.,"The unwise award to lodge it in the towers,"
6321,BOOK VIII.,An offering sacred to the immortal powers:
6322,BOOK VIII.,"The unwise prevail, they lodge it in the walls,"
6323,BOOK VIII.,And by the gods’ decree proud Ilion falls:
6324,BOOK VIII.,"Destruction enters in the treacherous wood,"
6325,BOOK VIII.,"And vengeful slaughter, fierce for human blood."
6326,BOOK VIII.,
6327,BOOK VIII.,"He sung the Greeks stern-issuing from the steed,"
6328,BOOK VIII.,"How Ilion burns, how all her fathers bleed;"
6329,BOOK VIII.,"How to thy dome, Deiphobus! ascends"
6330,BOOK VIII.,The Spartan king; how Ithacus attends
6331,BOOK VIII.,(Horrid as Mars); and how with dire alarms
6332,BOOK VIII.,"He fights—subdues, for Pallas strings his arms"
6333,BOOK VIII.,
6334,BOOK VIII.,"Thus while he sung, Ulysses’ griefs renew,"
6335,BOOK VIII.,"Tears bathe his cheeks, and tears the ground bedew"
6336,BOOK VIII.,As some fond matron views in mortal fight
6337,BOOK VIII.,Her husband falling in his country’s right;
6338,BOOK VIII.,"Frantic through clashing swords she runs, she flies,"
6339,BOOK VIII.,"As ghastly pale he groans, and faints and dies;"
6340,BOOK VIII.,"Close to his breast she grovels on the ground,"
6341,BOOK VIII.,And bathes with floods of tears the gaping wound;
6342,BOOK VIII.,"She cries, she shrieks: the fierce insulting foe"
6343,BOOK VIII.,Relentless mocks her violence of woe:
6344,BOOK VIII.,"To chains condemn’d, as wildly she deplores;"
6345,BOOK VIII.,"A widow, and a slave on foreign shores."
6346,BOOK VIII.,
6347,BOOK VIII.,So from the sluices of Ulysses’ eyes
6348,BOOK VIII.,"Fast fell the tears, and sighs succeeded sighs:"
6349,BOOK VIII.,Conceal’d he grieved: the king observed alone
6350,BOOK VIII.,"The silent tear, and heard the secret groan;"
6351,BOOK VIII.,"Then to the bard aloud: “O cease to sing,"
6352,BOOK VIII.,"Dumb be thy voice, and mute the tuneful string;"
6353,BOOK VIII.,"To every note his tears responsive flow,"
6354,BOOK VIII.,And his great heart heaves with tumultuous woe;
6355,BOOK VIII.,"Thy lay too deeply moves: then cease the lay,"
6356,BOOK VIII.,And o’er the banquet every heart be gay:
6357,BOOK VIII.,"This social right demands: for him the sails,"
6358,BOOK VIII.,"Floating in air, invite the impelling gales:"
6359,BOOK VIII.,His are the gifts of love: the wise and good
6360,BOOK VIII.,Receive the stranger as a brother’s blood.
6361,BOOK VIII.,
6362,BOOK VIII.,"“But, friend, discover faithful what I crave;"
6363,BOOK VIII.,Artful concealment ill becomes the brave:
6364,BOOK VIII.,"Say what thy birth, and what the name you bore,"
6365,BOOK VIII.,Imposed by parents in the natal hour?
6366,BOOK VIII.,"(For from the natal hour distinctive names,"
6367,BOOK VIII.,"One common right, the great and lowly claims:)"
6368,BOOK VIII.,"Say from what city, from what regions toss’d,"
6369,BOOK VIII.,And what inhabitants those regions boast?
6370,BOOK VIII.,"So shalt thou instant reach the realm assign’d,"
6371,BOOK VIII.,"In wondrous ships, self-moved, instinct with mind;"
6372,BOOK VIII.,"No helm secures their course, no pilot guides;"
6373,BOOK VIII.,"Like man intelligent, they plough the tides,"
6374,BOOK VIII.,"Conscious of every coast, and every bay,"
6375,BOOK VIII.,That lies beneath the sun’s all-seeing ray;
6376,BOOK VIII.,"Though clouds and darkness veil the encumber’d sky,"
6377,BOOK VIII.,Fearless through darkness and through clouds they fly;
6378,BOOK VIII.,"Though tempests rage, though rolls the swelling main,"
6379,BOOK VIII.,"The seas may roll, the tempests rage in vain;"
6380,BOOK VIII.,"E’en the stern god that o’er the waves presides,"
6381,BOOK VIII.,"Safe as they pass, and safe repass the tides,"
6382,BOOK VIII.,With fury burns; while careless they convey
6383,BOOK VIII.,"Promiscuous every guest to every bay,"
6384,BOOK VIII.,These ears have heard my royal sire disclose
6385,BOOK VIII.,"A dreadful story, big with future woes;"
6386,BOOK VIII.,"How Neptune raged, and how, by his command,"
6387,BOOK VIII.,Firm rooted in a surge a ship should stand
6388,BOOK VIII.,A monument of wrath; how mound on mound
6389,BOOK VIII.,Should bury these proud towers beneath the ground.
6390,BOOK VIII.,"But this the gods may frustrate or fulfil,"
6391,BOOK VIII.,As suits the purpose of the Eternal Will.
6392,BOOK VIII.,But say through what waste regions hast thou stray’d
6393,BOOK VIII.,"What customs noted, and what coasts survey’d;"
6394,BOOK VIII.,"Possess’d by wild barbarians fierce in arms,"
6395,BOOK VIII.,Or men whose bosom tender pity warms?
6396,BOOK VIII.,"Say why the fate of Troy awaked thy cares,"
6397,BOOK VIII.,"Why heaved thy bosom, and why flowed thy tears?"
6398,BOOK VIII.,Just are the ways of Heaven: from Heaven proceed
6399,BOOK VIII.,"The woes of man; Heaven doom’d the Greeks to bleed,"
6400,BOOK VIII.,"A theme of future song! Say, then, if slain"
6401,BOOK VIII.,Some dear-loved brother press’d the Phrygian plain?
6402,BOOK VIII.,"Or bled some friend, who bore a brother’s part,"
6403,BOOK VIII.,"And claim’d by merit, not by blood, the heart?”"

9317,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.",And forky lightnings flash from pole to pole:
9318,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.","Fierce at our heads his deadly bolt he aims,"
9319,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.","Red with uncommon wrath, and wrapp’d in flames:"
9320,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.","Full on the bark it fell; now high, now low,"
9321,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.","Toss’d and retoss’d, it reel’d beneath the blow;"

9323,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.","Sulphurous odours rose, and smouldering smoke."
9324,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.","Like fowl that haunt the floods, they sink, they rise,"
9325,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.","Now lost, now seen, with shrieks and dreadful cries;"
9326,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.","And strive to gain the bark, but Jove denies."

9333,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.",Through tumbling billows and a war of wind.
9334,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.","“Now sunk the west, and now a southern breeze,"
9335,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.",More dreadful than the tempest lash’d the seas;
9336,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.","For on the rocks it bore where Scylla raves,"
9337,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.",And dire Charybdis rolls her thundering waves.
9338,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.","All night I drove; and at the dawn of day,"
9339,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.",Fast by the rocks beheld the desperate way;

9341,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.","And in the roaring whirlpools rush the tides,"
9342,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.","Swift from the float I vaulted with a bound,"
9343,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.","The lofty fig-tree seized, and clung around;"
9344,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.","So to the beam the bat tenacious clings,"
9345,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.",And pendent round it clasps his leather wings.
9346,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.","High in the air the tree its boughs display’d,"
9347,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.",And o’er the dungeon cast a dreadful shade;
9348,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.","All unsustain’d between the wave and sky,"
9349,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.",Beneath my feet the whirling billows fly.
9350,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.",What time the judge forsakes the noisy bar
9351,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.","To take repast, and stills the wordy war,"
9352,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.","Charybdis, rumbling from her inmost caves,"
9353,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.",The mast refunded on her refluent waves.
9354,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.","Swift from the tree, the floating mass to gain,"

9357,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.",And oar’d with labouring arms along the flood.
9358,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.",Unseen I pass’d by Scylla’s dire abodes.
9359,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.",So Jove decreed (dread sire of men and gods).
9360,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.","Then nine long days I plow’d the calmer seas,"
9361,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.","Heaved by the surge, and wafted by the breeze."
9362,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.","Weary and wet the Ogygian shores I gain,"
9363,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.",When the tenth sun descended to the main.
9364,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.","There, in Calypso’s ever-fragrant bowers,"
9365,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.","Refresh’d I lay, and joy beguiled the hours."
9366,"THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.","“My following fates to thee, O king, are known,"

9844,THE ARRIVAL OF ULYSSES IN ITHACA.,"Our task be now thy treasured stores to save,"
9845,THE ARRIVAL OF ULYSSES IN ITHACA.,Deep in the close recesses of the cave;
9846,THE ARRIVAL OF ULYSSES IN ITHACA.,"Then future means consult.” She spoke, and trod"
9847,THE ARRIVAL OF ULYSSES IN ITHACA.,"The shady grot, that brighten’d with the god."
9848,THE ARRIVAL OF ULYSSES IN ITHACA.,The closest caverns of the grot she sought;

9860,THE ARRIVAL OF ULYSSES IN ITHACA.,And proud addresses to the matchless queen.
9861,THE ARRIVAL OF ULYSSES IN ITHACA.,"But she thy absence mourns from day to day,"
9862,THE ARRIVAL OF ULYSSES IN ITHACA.,"And inly bleeds, and silent wastes away;"

9864,THE ARRIVAL OF ULYSSES IN ITHACA.,"Fond hopes to all, and all with hopes deceives.”"
9865,THE ARRIVAL OF ULYSSES IN ITHACA.,
9866,THE ARRIVAL OF ULYSSES IN ITHACA.,To this Ulysses: “O celestial maid!

9870,THE ARRIVAL OF ULYSSES IN ITHACA.,"Vouchsafe the means of vengeance to debate,"
9871,THE ARRIVAL OF ULYSSES IN ITHACA.,And plan with all thy arts the scene of fate.
9872,THE ARRIVAL OF ULYSSES IN ITHACA.,"Then, then be present, and my soul inspire,"
9873,THE ARRIVAL OF ULYSSES IN ITHACA.,As when we wrapp’d Troy’s heaven-built walls in fire.
9874,THE ARRIVAL OF ULYSSES IN ITHACA.,Though leagued against me hundred heroes stand.
9875,THE ARRIVAL OF ULYSSES IN ITHACA.,"Hundreds shall fall, if Pallas aid my hand.”"
9876,THE ARRIVAL OF ULYSSES IN ITHACA.,
9877,THE ARRIVAL OF ULYSSES IN ITHACA.,She answer’d: “In the dreadful day of fight

9896,THE ARRIVAL OF ULYSSES IN ITHACA.,"“Go first the master of thy herds to find,"
9897,THE ARRIVAL OF ULYSSES IN ITHACA.,"True to his charge, a loyal swain and kind;"
9898,THE ARRIVAL OF ULYSSES IN ITHACA.,For thee he sighs; and to the loyal heir
9899,THE ARRIVAL OF ULYSSES IN ITHACA.,And chaste Penelope extends his care.
9900,THE ARRIVAL OF ULYSSES IN ITHACA.,"At the Coracian rock he now resides,"
9901,THE ARRIVAL OF ULYSSES IN ITHACA.,Where Arethusa’s sable water glides;

9970,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,Ulysses found him busied as he sate
9971,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,Before the threshold of his rustic gate;
9972,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,Around the mansion in a circle shone
9973,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,A rural portico of rugged stone
9974,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,(In absence of his lord with honest toil
9975,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,His own industrious hands had raised the pile).
9976,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"The wall was stone from neighbouring quarries borne,"
9977,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Encircled with a fence of native thorn,"
9978,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"And strong with pales, by many a weary stroke"
9979,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,Of stubborn labour hewn from heart of oak:
9980,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,Frequent and thick. Within the space were rear’d
9981,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Twelve ample cells, the lodgments of his herd."
9982,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,Full fifty pregnant females each contain’d;
9983,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,The males without (a smaller race) remain’d;
9984,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Doom’d to supply the suitors’ wasteful feast,"
9985,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,A stock by daily luxury decreased;
9986,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Now scarce four hundred left. These to defend,"

9990,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Of four assistants who his labour share,"
9991,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,Three now were absent on the rural care;
9992,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,The fourth drove victims to a suitor train:

9994,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Sigh’d, while he furnish’d the luxurious board,"

9997,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Soon as Ulysses near the inclosure drew,"
9998,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,With open mouths the furious mastiffs flew:

10001,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Sudden, the master runs; aloud he calls;"

10005,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,
10006,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,“Unhappy stranger! (thus the faithful swain

10026,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"A shaggy goat’s soft hide beneath him spread,"

10043,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"To whom whate’er his slave enjoys is owed,"
10044,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"And more, had Fate allow’d, had been bestow’d:"
10045,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,But Fate condemn’d him to a foreign shore;
10046,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Much have I sorrow’d, but my Master more."
10047,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Now cold he lies, to death’s embrace resign’d:"
10048,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Ah, perish Helen! perish all her kind!"
10049,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"For whose cursed cause, in Agamemnon’s name,"

10052,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"His vest succinct then girding round his waist,"

10057,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"These quarter’d, singed, and fix’d on forks of wood,"
10058,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,All hasty on the hissing coals he threw;

10069,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Rich without bounty, guilty without fears;"
10070,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Yet sure the gods their impious acts detest,"
10071,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,And honour justice and the righteous breast.
10072,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Pirates and conquerors of harden’d mind,"
10073,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"The foes of peace, and scourges of mankind,"

10079,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"‘Wretch! this is villainy, and this is sin.’"
10080,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"But these, no doubt, some oracle explore,"

10096,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"To native pastors is their charge assign’d,"
10097,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,And mine the care to feed the bristly kind;
10098,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Each day the fattest bleeds of either herd,"

10418,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,In safety to Dulichium’s friendly court.
10419,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"But if he greets not thy desiring eye,"
10420,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,Hurl me from yon dread precipice on high:
10421,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,The due reward of fraud and perjury.”
10422,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,
10423,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"“Doubtless, O guest! great laud and praise were mine"
10424,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"(Replied the swain, for spotless faith divine),"
10425,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"If after social rites and gifts bestow’d,"
10426,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,I stain’d my hospitable hearth with blood.
10427,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"How would the gods my righteous toils succeed,"
10428,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,And bless the hand that made a stranger bleed?
10429,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,No more—the approaching hours of silent night
10430,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"First claim refection, then to rest invite;"
10431,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Beneath our humble cottage let us haste,"
10432,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"And here, unenvied, rural dainties taste.”"
10433,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,
10434,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,Thus communed these; while to their lowly dome
10435,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,The full-fed swine return’d with evening home;
10436,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Compell’d, reluctant, to their several sties,"
10437,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"With din obstreperous, and ungrateful cries."
10438,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,Then to the slaves: “Now from the herd the best
10439,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,Select in honour of our foreign guest:
10440,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"With him let us the genial banquet share,"
10441,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,For great and many are the griefs we bear;
10442,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,While those who from our labours heap their board
10443,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Blaspheme their feeder, and forget their lord.”"
10444,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,
10445,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Thus speaking, with despatchful hand he took"
10446,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"A weighty axe, and cleft the solid oak;"
10447,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"This on the earth he piled; a boar full fed,"
10448,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Of five years’ age, before the pile was led:"
10449,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"The swain, whom acts of piety delight,"
10450,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Observant of the gods, begins the rite;"
10451,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"First shears the forehead of the bristly boar,"
10452,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"And suppliant stands, invoking every power"
10453,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,To speed Ulysses to his native shore.
10454,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"A knotty stake then aiming at his head,"
10455,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Down dropped he groaning, and the spirit fled."
10456,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,The scorching flames climb round on every side;
10457,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,Then the singed members they with skill divide;
10458,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"On these, in rolls of fat involved with art,"
10459,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,The choicest morsels lay from every part.
10460,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,Some in the flames bestrew’d with flour they threw;
10461,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,Some cut in fragments from the forks they drew:
10462,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,These while on several tables they dispose.
10463,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,A priest himself the blameless rustic rose;
10464,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,Expert the destined victim to dispart
10465,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"In seven just portions, pure of hand and heart."
10466,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,One sacred to the nymphs apart they lay:
10467,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,Another to the winged son of May;
10468,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"The rural tribe in common share the rest,"
10469,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"The king the chine, the honour of the feast,"
10470,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,Who sate delighted at his servant’s board;
10471,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,The faithful servant joy’d his unknown lord.
10472,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"“Oh be thou dear (Ulysses cried) to Jove,"
10473,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,As well thou claim’st a grateful stranger’s love!”
10474,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,
10475,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,“Be then thy thanks (the bounteous swain replied)
10476,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,Enjoyment of the good the gods provide.
10477,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,From God’s own hand descend our joys and woes;
10478,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"These he decrees, and he but suffers those:"
10479,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"All power is his, and whatsoe’er he wills,"
10480,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"The will itself, omnipotent, fulfils.”"
10481,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"This said, the first-fruits to the gods he gave;"
10482,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,Then pour’d of offer’d wine the sable wave:
10483,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"In great Ulysses’ hand he placed the bowl,"
10484,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"He sate, and sweet refection cheer’d his soul."
10485,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,The bread from canisters Mesaulius gave
10486,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"(Eumaeus’ proper treasure bought this slave,"
10487,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"And led from Taphos, to attend his board,"

10489,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"His task it was the wheaten loaves to lay,"
10490,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,And from the banquet take the bowls away.
10491,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"And now the rage of hunger was repress’d,"
10492,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,And each betakes him to his couch to rest.
10493,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,
10494,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Now came the night, and darkness cover’d o’er"
10495,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,The face of things; the winds began to roar;
10496,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"The driving storm the watery west-wind pours,"
10497,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,And Jove descends in deluges of showers.
10498,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Studious of rest and warmth, Ulysses lies,"
10499,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,Foreseeing from the first the storm would rise
10500,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"In mere necessity of coat and cloak,"
10501,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,With artful preface to his host he spoke:
10502,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"“Hear me, my friends! who this good banquet grace;"
10503,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"’Tis sweet to play the fool in time and place,"
10504,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"And wine can of their wits the wise beguile,"
10505,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Make the sage frolic, and the serious smile,"
10506,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"The grave in merry measures frisk about,"
10507,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,And many a long-repented word bring out.
10508,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Since to be talkative I now commence,"
10509,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,Let wit cast off the sullen yoke of sense.
10510,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,Once I was strong (would Heaven restore those days!)
10511,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,And with my betters claim’d a share of praise.
10512,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Ulysses, Menelaus, led forth a band,"
10513,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,And join’d me with them (’twas their own command);
10514,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"A deathful ambush for the foe to lay,"
10515,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,Beneath Troy walls by night we took our way:
10516,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"There, clad in arms, along the marshes spread,"
10517,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,We made the osier-fringed bank our bed.
10518,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Full soon the inclemency of heaven I feel,"
10519,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Nor had these shoulders covering, but of steel."
10520,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,Sharp blew the north; snow whitening all the fields
10521,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Froze with the blast, and gathering glazed our shields."
10522,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"There all but I, well fenced with cloak and vest,"
10523,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,Lay cover’d by their ample shields at rest.
10524,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Fool that I was! I left behind my own,"
10525,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"The skill of weather and of winds unknown,"
10526,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,And trusted to my coat and shield alone!
10527,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"When now was wasted more than half the night,"
10528,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"And the stars faded at approaching light,"
10529,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Sudden I jogg’d Ulysses, who was laid"
10530,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Fast by my side, and shivering thus I said:"
10531,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,
10532,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,“‘Here longer in this field I cannot lie;

10535,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,The only fool who left his cloak behind.’
10536,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,
10537,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"“He thought and answer’d: hardly waking yet,"
10538,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,Sprung in his mind a momentary wit
10539,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"(That wit, which or in council or in fight,"
10540,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Still met the emergence, and determined right)."
10541,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"‘Hush thee (he cried, soft whispering in my ear),"
10542,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Speak not a word, lest any Greek may hear’—"
10543,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"And then (supporting on his arm his head),"
10544,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"‘Hear me, companions! (thus aloud he said:)"
10545,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,Methinks too distant from the fleet we lie:
10546,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"E’en now a vision stood before my eye,"
10547,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,And sure the warning vision was from high:
10548,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Let from among us some swift courier rise,"
10549,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Haste to the general, and demand supplies.’"
10550,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,
10551,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"“Up started Thoas straight, Andraemon’s son,"
10552,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Nimbly he rose, and cast his garment down!"
10553,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Instant, the racer vanish’d off the ground;"
10554,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,That instant in his cloak I wrapp’d me round:
10555,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"And safe I slept, till brightly-dawning shone"
10556,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,The morn conspicuous on her golden throne.
10557,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,
10558,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"“Oh were my strength as then, as then my age!"
10559,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,Some friend would fence me from the winter’s rage.
10560,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Yet, tatter’d as I look, I challenged then"
10561,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,The honours and the offices of men:
10562,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Some master, or some servant would allow"
10563,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,A cloak and vest—but I am nothing now!”

10567,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"Nor garment shalt thou want, nor aught beside,"
10568,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,Meet for the wandering suppliant to provide.
10569,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"But in the morning take thy clothes again,"
10570,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,For here one vest suffices every swain:
10571,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,No change of garments to our hinds is known;

10576,THE CONVERSATION WITH EUMAEUS.,"The honest herdsman rose, as this he said,"

10603,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,The goddess Minerva commands Telemachus in a vision to return to
10604,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,"Ithaca. Pisistratus and he take leave of Menelaus, and arrive at Pylos,"
10605,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,"where they part: and Telemachus sets sail, after having received on"
10606,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,board Theoclymenus the soothsayer. The scene then changes to the
10607,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,"cottage of Eumaeus, who entertains Ulysses with a recital of his"
10608,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,"adventures. In the meantime Telemachus arrives on the coast, and"
10609,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,"sending the vessel to the town, proceeds by himself to the lodge of"
10610,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,Eumaeus.
10611,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,
10612,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,
10613,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,"Now had Minerva reach’d those ample plains,"

10615,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,"Anxious she flies to great Ulysses’ heir,"
10616,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,His instant voyage challenged all her care.
10617,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,"Beneath the royal portico display’d,"
10618,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,With Nestor’s son Telemachus was laid:
10619,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,In sleep profound the son of Nestor lies;
10620,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,"Not thine, Ulysses! Care unseal’d his eyes:"
10621,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,"Restless he grieved, with various fears oppress’d,"
10622,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,And all thy fortunes roll’d within his breast.
10623,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,"When, “O Telemachus! (the goddess said)"
10624,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,"Too long in vain, too widely hast thou stray’d,"
10625,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,Thus leaving careless thy paternal right
10626,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,"The robbers’ prize, the prey to lawless might."
10627,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,"On fond pursuits neglectful while you roam,"
10628,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,E’en now the hand of rapine sacks the dome.
10629,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,Hence to Atrides; and his leave implore

10661,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,"That thou, safe sailing from the Pylian strand,"
10662,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,Art come to bless her in thy native land.”
10663,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,"Thus spoke the goddess, and resumed her flight"
10664,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,"To the pure regions of eternal light,"

10673,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,"Here wait we rather, till approaching day"

10691,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,
10692,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,"“If with desire so strong thy bosom glows,"
10693,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,Ill (said the king) should I thy wish oppose;
10694,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,For oft in others freely I reprove
10695,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,The ill-timed efforts of officious love;
10696,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,"Who love too much, hate in the like extreme,"
10697,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,And both the golden mean alike condemn.
10698,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,"Alike he thwarts the hospitable end,"
10699,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,"Who drives the free, or stays the hasty friend:"
10700,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,"True friendship’s laws are by this rule express’d,"
10701,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,"Welcome the coming, speed the parting guest."
10702,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,"Yet, stay, my friends, and in your chariot take"
10703,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,The noblest presents that our love can make;
10704,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,Meantime commit we to our women’s care
10705,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,Some choice domestic viands to prepare;
10706,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,"The traveller, rising from the banquet gay,"
10707,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,"Eludes the labours of the tedious way,"

10710,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,Atrides in his chariot shall attend;
10711,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,Himself thy convoy to each royal friend.
10712,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,No prince will let Ulysses’ heir remove
10713,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,"Without some pledge, some monument of love:"
10714,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,"These will the caldron, these the tripod give;"
10715,THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.,"From those the well-pair’d mules we shall receive,"

11873,ARGUMENT.,"Arriving now before the imperial hall,"
11874,ARGUMENT.,He props his spear against the pillar’d wall;
11875,ARGUMENT.,Then like a lion o’er the threshold bounds;
11876,ARGUMENT.,The marble pavement with his steps resounds:
11877,ARGUMENT.,His eye first glanced where Euryclea spreads
11878,ARGUMENT.,With furry spoils of beasts the splendid beds:
11879,ARGUMENT.,"She saw, she wept, she ran with eager pace,"
11880,ARGUMENT.,And reach’d her master with a long embrace.
11881,ARGUMENT.,"All crowded round, the family appears"
11882,ARGUMENT.,"With wild entrancement, and ecstatic tears."
11883,ARGUMENT.,Swift from above descends the royal fair
11884,ARGUMENT.,"(Her beauteous cheeks the blush of Venus wear,"
11885,ARGUMENT.,Chasten’d with coy Diana’s pensive air);
11886,ARGUMENT.,"Hangs o’er her son, in his embraces dies;"
11887,ARGUMENT.,"Rains kisses on his neck, his face, his eyes:"
11888,ARGUMENT.,"Few words she spoke, though much she had to say;"
11889,ARGUMENT.,"And scarce those few, for tears, could force their way."
11890,ARGUMENT.,
11891,ARGUMENT.,“Light of my eyes: he comes! unhoped-for joy!
11892,ARGUMENT.,Has Heaven from Pylos brought my lovely boy?
11893,ARGUMENT.,"So snatch’d from all our cares!—Tell, hast thou known"
11894,ARGUMENT.,"Thy father’s fate, and tell me all thy own.”"
11895,ARGUMENT.,
11896,ARGUMENT.,“Oh dearest! most revered of womankind!
11897,ARGUMENT.,Cease with those tears to melt a manly mind
11898,ARGUMENT.,"(Replied the prince); nor be our fates deplored,"
11899,ARGUMENT.,From death and treason to thy arms restored.
11900,ARGUMENT.,"Go bathe, and robed in white ascend the towers;"
11901,ARGUMENT.,With all thy handmaids thank the immortal powers;
11902,ARGUMENT.,To every god vow hecatombs to bleed.
11903,ARGUMENT.,And call Jove’s vengeance on their guilty deed.
11904,ARGUMENT.,While to the assembled council I repair:
11905,ARGUMENT.,A stranger sent by Heaven attends me there;
11906,ARGUMENT.,"My new accepted guest I haste to find,"
11907,ARGUMENT.,Now to Peiraeus’ honour’d charge consign’d.”
11908,ARGUMENT.,
11909,ARGUMENT.,"The matron heard, nor was his word in vain."
11910,ARGUMENT.,"She bathed; and, robed in white, with all her train,"
11911,ARGUMENT.,"To every god vow’d hecatombs to bleed,"
11912,ARGUMENT.,"And call’d Jove’s vengeance on the guilty deed,"
11913,ARGUMENT.,"Arm’d with his lance, the prince then pass’d the gate,"
11914,ARGUMENT.,"Two dogs behind, a faithful guard, await;"
11915,ARGUMENT.,Pallas his form with grace divine improves:
11916,ARGUMENT.,The gazing crowd admires him as he moves.
11917,ARGUMENT.,"Him, gathering round, the haughty suitors greet"
11918,ARGUMENT.,"With semblance fair, but inward deep deceit,"
11919,ARGUMENT.,"Their false addresses, generous, he denied."
11920,ARGUMENT.,"Pass’d on, and sate by faithful Mentor’s side;"
11921,ARGUMENT.,"With Antiphus, and Halitherses sage"
11922,ARGUMENT.,"(His father’s counsellors, revered for age)."
11923,ARGUMENT.,"Of his own fortunes, and Ulysses’ fame,"
11924,ARGUMENT.,Much ask’d the seniors; till Peiraeus came.
11925,ARGUMENT.,The stranger-guest pursued him close behind;
11926,ARGUMENT.,"Whom when Telemachus beheld, he join’d."
11927,ARGUMENT.,He (when Peiraeus ask’d for slaves to bring
11928,ARGUMENT.,The gifts and treasures of the Spartan king)
11929,ARGUMENT.,"Thus thoughtful answer’d: “Those we shall not move,"
11930,ARGUMENT.,Dark and unconscious of the will of Jove;
11931,ARGUMENT.,We know not yet the full event of all:
11932,ARGUMENT.,"Stabb’d in his palace if your prince must fall,"
11933,ARGUMENT.,"Us, and our house, if treason must o’erthrow,"
11934,ARGUMENT.,Better a friend possess them than a foe;
11935,ARGUMENT.,"If death to these, and vengeance Heaven decree,"
11936,ARGUMENT.,"Riches are welcome then, not else, to me."
11937,ARGUMENT.,"Till then retain the gifts.”—The hero said,"
11938,ARGUMENT.,And in his hand the willing stranger led.
11939,ARGUMENT.,"Then disarray’d, the shining bath they sought"
11940,ARGUMENT.,(With unguents smooth) of polish’d marble wrought:
11941,ARGUMENT.,Obedient handmaids with assistant toil
11942,ARGUMENT.,"Supply the limpid wave, and fragrant oil:"
11943,ARGUMENT.,"Then o’er their limbs refulgent robes they threw,"
11944,ARGUMENT.,And fresh from bathing to their seats withdrew.
11945,ARGUMENT.,"The golden ewer a nymph attendant brings,"
11946,ARGUMENT.,Replenish’d from the pure translucent springs;
11947,ARGUMENT.,With copious streams that golden ewer supplies
11948,ARGUMENT.,A silver layer of capacious size.
11949,ARGUMENT.,"They wash: the table, in fair order spread,"
11950,ARGUMENT.,Is piled with viands and the strength of bread.
11951,ARGUMENT.,"Full opposite, before the folding gate,"
11952,ARGUMENT.,The pensive mother sits in humble state;
11953,ARGUMENT.,"Lowly she sate, and with dejected view"
11954,ARGUMENT.,The fleecy threads her ivory fingers drew.
11955,ARGUMENT.,"The prince and stranger shared the genial feast,"
11956,ARGUMENT.,Till now the rage of thirst and hunger ceased.
11957,ARGUMENT.,
11958,ARGUMENT.,When thus the queen: “My son! my only friend!
11959,ARGUMENT.,"Say, to my mournful couch shall I ascend?"
11960,ARGUMENT.,(The couch deserted now a length of years;
11961,ARGUMENT.,The couch for ever water’d with my tears;)
11962,ARGUMENT.,"Say, wilt thou not (ere yet the suitor crew"
11963,ARGUMENT.,"Return, and riot shakes our walls anew),"
11964,ARGUMENT.,"Say, wilt thou not the least account afford?"
11965,ARGUMENT.,The least glad tidings of my absent lord?”
11966,ARGUMENT.,
11967,ARGUMENT.,"To her the youth. “We reach’d the Pylian plains,"
11968,ARGUMENT.,"Where Nestor, shepherd of his people, reigns."
11969,ARGUMENT.,"All arts of tenderness to him are known,"
11970,ARGUMENT.,Kind to Ulysses’ race as to his own;
11971,ARGUMENT.,No father with a fonder grasp of joy
11972,ARGUMENT.,Strains to his bosom his long-absent boy.
11973,ARGUMENT.,"But all unknown, if yet Ulysses breathe,"
11974,ARGUMENT.,Or glide a spectre in the realms beneath;
11975,ARGUMENT.,"For farther search, his rapid steeds transport"
11976,ARGUMENT.,My lengthen’d journey to the Spartan court.
11977,ARGUMENT.,"There Argive Helen I beheld, whose charms"
11978,ARGUMENT.,(So Heaven decreed) engaged the great in arms.
11979,ARGUMENT.,"My cause of coming told, he thus rejoin’d;"
11980,ARGUMENT.,And still his words live perfect in my mind:
11981,ARGUMENT.,
11982,ARGUMENT.,"“‘Heavens! would a soft, inglorious, dastard train"
11983,ARGUMENT.,An absent hero’s nuptial joys profane
11984,ARGUMENT.,"So with her young, amid the woodland shades,"
11985,ARGUMENT.,"A timorous hind the lion’s court invades,"
11986,ARGUMENT.,"Leaves in that fatal lair her tender fawns,"
11987,ARGUMENT.,"And climbs the cliffs, or feeds along the lawns;"
11988,ARGUMENT.,"Meantime returning, with remorseless sway"
11989,ARGUMENT.,The monarch savage rends the panting prey:
11990,ARGUMENT.,"With equal fury, and with equal fame,"
11991,ARGUMENT.,Shall great Ulysses reassert his claim.
11992,ARGUMENT.,O Jove! supreme! whom men and gods revere;
11993,ARGUMENT.,And thou whose lustre gilds the rolling sphere!
11994,ARGUMENT.,"With power congenial join’d, propitious aid"
11995,ARGUMENT.,The chief adopted by the martial maid!
11996,ARGUMENT.,"Such to our wish the warrior soon restore,"
11997,ARGUMENT.,"As when, contending on the Lesbian shore,"
11998,ARGUMENT.,"His prowess Philomelides confess’d,"
11999,ARGUMENT.,And loud acclaiming Greeks the victor bless’d:
12000,ARGUMENT.,"Then soon the invaders of his bed, and throne,"
12001,ARGUMENT.,Their love presumptuous shall by death atone.
12002,ARGUMENT.,"Now what you question of my ancient friend,"
12003,ARGUMENT.,With truth I answer; thou the truth attend.
12004,ARGUMENT.,"Learn what I heard the sea-born seer relate,"
12005,ARGUMENT.,Whose eye can pierce the dark recess of fate
12006,ARGUMENT.,"Sole in an isle, imprison’d by the main,"
12007,ARGUMENT.,"The sad survivor of his numerous train,"
12008,ARGUMENT.,"Ulysses lies; detain’d by magic charms,"
12009,ARGUMENT.,And press’d unwilling in Calypso’s arms.
12010,ARGUMENT.,"No sailors there, no vessels to convey,"
12011,ARGUMENT.,No oars to cut the immeasurable way.’
12012,ARGUMENT.,"This told Atrides, and he told no more."
12013,ARGUMENT.,Then safe I voyaged to my native shore.”
12014,ARGUMENT.,
12015,ARGUMENT.,"He ceased; nor made the pensive queen reply,"
12016,ARGUMENT.,"But droop’d her head, and drew a secret sigh."
12017,ARGUMENT.,When Theoclymenus the seer began:
12018,ARGUMENT.,“O suffering consort of the suffering man!
12019,ARGUMENT.,"What human knowledge could, those kings might tell,"
12020,ARGUMENT.,But I the secrets of high heaven reveal.
12021,ARGUMENT.,"Before the first of gods be this declared,"
12022,ARGUMENT.,Before the board whose blessings we have shared;
12023,ARGUMENT.,"Witness the genial rites, and witness all"
12024,ARGUMENT.,This house holds sacred in her ample wall!
12025,ARGUMENT.,"E’en now, this instant, great Ulysses, laid"
12026,ARGUMENT.,"At rest, or wandering in his country’s shade,"
12027,ARGUMENT.,"Their guilty deeds, in hearing, and in view,"
12028,ARGUMENT.,Secret revolves; and plans the vengeance due.
12029,ARGUMENT.,"Of this sure auguries the gods bestow’d,"
12030,ARGUMENT.,When first our vessel anchor’d in your road.”
12031,ARGUMENT.,"“Succeed those omens, Heaven! (the queen rejoin’d)"
12032,ARGUMENT.,So shall our bounties speak a grateful mind;
12033,ARGUMENT.,And every envied happiness attend
12034,ARGUMENT.,The man who calls Penelope his friend.”
12035,ARGUMENT.,Thus communed they: while in the marble court
12036,ARGUMENT.,(Scene of their insolence) the lords resort:
12037,ARGUMENT.,"Athwart the spacious square each tries his art,"
12038,ARGUMENT.,"To whirl the disk, or aim the missile dart."
12039,ARGUMENT.,"Now did the hour of sweet repast arrive,"
12040,ARGUMENT.,And from the field the victim flocks they drive:
12041,ARGUMENT.,"Medon the herald (one who pleased them best,"
12042,ARGUMENT.,"And honour’d with a portion of their feast),"
12043,ARGUMENT.,"To bid the banquet, interrupts their play:"
12044,ARGUMENT.,Swift to the hall they haste; aside they lay
12045,ARGUMENT.,"Their garments, and succinct the victims slay."
12046,ARGUMENT.,"Then sheep, and goats, and bristly porkers bled,"
12047,ARGUMENT.,And the proud steer was o’er the marble spread.
12048,ARGUMENT.,"While thus the copious banquet they provide,"
12049,ARGUMENT.,"Along the road, conversing side by side,"
12050,ARGUMENT.,Proceed Ulysses and the faithful swain;
12051,ARGUMENT.,"When thus Eumaeus, generous and humane:"
12052,ARGUMENT.,"“To town, observant of our lord’s behest,"
12053,ARGUMENT.,Now let us speed; my friend no more my guest!
12054,ARGUMENT.,"Yet like myself I wish thee here preferr’d,"
12055,ARGUMENT.,"Guard of the flock, or keeper of the herd,"
12056,ARGUMENT.,But much to raise my master’s wrath I fear;
12057,ARGUMENT.,The wrath of princes ever is severe.
12058,ARGUMENT.,"Then heed his will, and be our journey made"
12059,ARGUMENT.,"While the broad beams of Phœbus are display’d,"
12060,ARGUMENT.,Or ere brown evening spreads her chilly shade.”
12061,ARGUMENT.,"“Just thy advice (the prudent chief rejoin’d),"
12062,ARGUMENT.,And such as suits the dictate of my mind.
12063,ARGUMENT.,Lead on: but help me to some staff to stay
12064,ARGUMENT.,"My feeble step, since rugged is the way.”"
12065,ARGUMENT.,"Across his shoulders then the scrip he flung,"
12066,ARGUMENT.,"Wide-patch’d, and fasten’d by a twisted thong."
12067,ARGUMENT.,A staff Eumaeus gave. Along the way
12068,ARGUMENT.,"Cheerly they fare: behind, the keepers stay:"
12069,ARGUMENT.,These with their watchful dogs (a constant guard)
12070,ARGUMENT.,"Supply his absence, and attend the herd."
12071,ARGUMENT.,"And now his city strikes the monarch’s eyes,"
12072,ARGUMENT.,Alas! how changed! a man of miseries;
12073,ARGUMENT.,"Propp’d on a staff, a beggar old and bare"
12074,ARGUMENT.,In rags dishonest fluttering with the air!
12075,ARGUMENT.,"Now pass’d the rugged road, they journey down"
12076,ARGUMENT.,"The cavern’d way descending to the town,"
12077,ARGUMENT.,"Where, from the rock, with liquid drops distils"
12078,ARGUMENT.,A limpid fount; that spread in parting rills
12079,ARGUMENT.,Its current thence to serve the city brings;
12080,ARGUMENT.,"An useful work, adorn’d by ancient kings."
12081,ARGUMENT.,"Neritus, Ithacus, Polyctor, there,"
12082,ARGUMENT.,"In sculptured stone immortalized their care,"
12083,ARGUMENT.,"In marble urns received it from above,"
12084,ARGUMENT.,And shaded with a green surrounding grove;
12085,ARGUMENT.,"Where silver alders, in high arches twined,"
12086,ARGUMENT.,"Drink the cool stream, and tremble to the wind."
12087,ARGUMENT.,"Beneath, sequester’d to the nymphs, is seen"
12088,ARGUMENT.,"A mossy altar, deep embower’d in green;"
12089,ARGUMENT.,"Where constant vows by travellers are paid,"
12090,ARGUMENT.,And holy horrors solemnize the shade.
12091,ARGUMENT.,
12092,ARGUMENT.,"Here with his goats (not vow’d to sacred fame,"
12093,ARGUMENT.,But pamper’d luxury) Melanthius came:
12094,ARGUMENT.,Two grooms attend him. With an envious look
12095,ARGUMENT.,"He eyed the stranger, and imperious spoke:"
12096,ARGUMENT.,
12097,ARGUMENT.,“The good old proverb how this pair fulfil!
12098,ARGUMENT.,One rogue is usher to another still.
12099,ARGUMENT.,Heaven with a secret principle endued
12100,ARGUMENT.,"Mankind, to seek their own similitude."
12101,ARGUMENT.,Where goes the swineherd with that ill-look’d guest?
12102,ARGUMENT.,"That giant-glutton, dreadful at a feast!"
12103,ARGUMENT.,"Full many a post have those broad shoulders worn,"
12104,ARGUMENT.,From every great man’s gate repulsed with scorn:
12105,ARGUMENT.,"To no brave prize aspired the worthless swain,"
12106,ARGUMENT.,"’Twas but for scraps he ask’d, and ask’d in vain."
12107,ARGUMENT.,"To beg, than work, he better understands,"
12108,ARGUMENT.,Or we perhaps might take him off thy hands.
12109,ARGUMENT.,"For any office could the slave be good,"
12110,ARGUMENT.,"To cleanse the fold, or help the kids to food."
12111,ARGUMENT.,"If any labour those big joints could learn,"
12112,ARGUMENT.,"Some whey, to wash his bowels, he might earn."
12113,ARGUMENT.,"To cringe, to whine, his idle hands to spread,"
12114,ARGUMENT.,"Is all, by which that graceless maw is fed."
12115,ARGUMENT.,Yet hear me! if thy impudence but dare
12116,ARGUMENT.,"Approach yon wall, I prophesy thy fare:"
12117,ARGUMENT.,"Dearly, full dearly, shalt thou buy thy bread"
12118,ARGUMENT.,With many a footstool thundering at thy head.”
12119,ARGUMENT.,
12120,ARGUMENT.,"He thus: nor insolent of word alone,"
12121,ARGUMENT.,Spurn’d with his rustic heel his king unknown;
12122,ARGUMENT.,"Spurn’d, but not moved: he like a pillar stood,"
12123,ARGUMENT.,"Nor stirr’d an inch, contemptuous, from the road:"
12124,ARGUMENT.,"Doubtful, or with his staff to strike him dead,"
12125,ARGUMENT.,Or greet the pavement with his worthless head.
12126,ARGUMENT.,"Short was that doubt; to quell his rage inured,"
12127,ARGUMENT.,"The hero stood self-conquer’d, and endured."
12128,ARGUMENT.,"But hateful of the wretch, Eumaeus heaved"
12129,ARGUMENT.,"His hands obtesting, and this prayer conceived:"
12130,ARGUMENT.,“Daughters of Jove! who from the ethereal bowers
12131,ARGUMENT.,"Descend to swell the springs, and feed the flowers!"
12132,ARGUMENT.,Nymphs of this fountain! to whose sacred names
12133,ARGUMENT.,Our rural victims mount in blazing flames!
12134,ARGUMENT.,To whom Ulysses’ piety preferr’d
12135,ARGUMENT.,The yearly firstlings of his flock and herd;
12136,ARGUMENT.,"Succeed my wish, your votary restore:"
12137,ARGUMENT.,"Oh, be some god his convoy to our shore!"
12138,ARGUMENT.,"Due pains shall punish then this slave’s offence,"
12139,ARGUMENT.,"And humble all his airs of insolence,"
12140,ARGUMENT.,"Who, proudly stalking, leaves the herds at large,"
12141,ARGUMENT.,"Commences courtier, and neglects his charge.”"
12142,ARGUMENT.,
12143,ARGUMENT.,“What mutters he? (Melanthius sharp rejoins;)
12144,ARGUMENT.,"This crafty miscreant, big with dark designs?"
12145,ARGUMENT.,"The day shall come—nay, ’tis already near—"
12146,ARGUMENT.,"When, slave! to sell thee at a price too dear"
12147,ARGUMENT.,"Must be my care; and hence transport thee o’er,"
12148,ARGUMENT.,A load and scandal to this happy shore.
12149,ARGUMENT.,"Oh! that as surely great Apollo’s dart,"
12150,ARGUMENT.,"Or some brave suitor’s sword, might pierce the heart"
12151,ARGUMENT.,Of the proud son; as that we stand this hour
12152,ARGUMENT.,In lasting safety from the father’s power!”
12153,ARGUMENT.,
12154,ARGUMENT.,"So spoke the wretch, but, shunning farther fray,"
12155,ARGUMENT.,"Turn’d his proud step, and left them on their way."
12156,ARGUMENT.,"Straight to the feastful palace he repair’d,"
12157,ARGUMENT.,"Familiar enter’d, and the banquet shared;"
12158,ARGUMENT.,"Beneath Eurymachus, his patron lord,"
12159,ARGUMENT.,"He took his place, and plenty heap’d the board."
12160,ARGUMENT.,
12161,ARGUMENT.,"Meantime they heard, soft circling in the sky"
12162,ARGUMENT.,"Sweet airs ascend, and heavenly minstrelsy"
12163,ARGUMENT.,(For Phemius to the lyre attuned the strain):
12164,ARGUMENT.,"Ulysses hearken’d, then address’d the swain:"
12165,ARGUMENT.,
12166,ARGUMENT.,"“Well may this palace admiration claim,"
12167,ARGUMENT.,Great and respondent to the master’s fame!
12168,ARGUMENT.,"Stage above stage the imperial structure stands,"
12169,ARGUMENT.,"Holds the chief honours, and the town commands:"
12170,ARGUMENT.,"High walls and battlements the courts inclose,"
12171,ARGUMENT.,And the strong gates defy a host of foes.
12172,ARGUMENT.,Far other cares its dwellers now employ;
12173,ARGUMENT.,The throng’d assembly and the feast of joy:
12174,ARGUMENT.,"I see the smokes of sacrifice aspire,"
12175,ARGUMENT.,And hear (what graces every feast) the lyre.”
12176,ARGUMENT.,
12177,ARGUMENT.,Then thus Eumaeus: “Judge we which were best;
12178,ARGUMENT.,Amidst yon revellers a sudden guest
12179,ARGUMENT.,"Choose you to mingle, while behind I stay?"
12180,ARGUMENT.,Or I first entering introduce the way?
12181,ARGUMENT.,"Wait for a space without, but wait not long;"
12182,ARGUMENT.,This is the house of violence and wrong:
12183,ARGUMENT.,Some rude insult thy reverend age may bear;
12184,ARGUMENT.,For like their lawless lords the servants are.”
12185,ARGUMENT.,
12186,ARGUMENT.,"“Just is, O friend! thy caution, and address’d"
12187,ARGUMENT.,"(Replied the chief, to no unheedful breast:)"
12188,ARGUMENT.,The wrongs and injuries of base mankind
12189,ARGUMENT.,"Fresh to my sense, and always in my mind."
12190,ARGUMENT.,The bravely-patient to no fortune yields:
12191,ARGUMENT.,"On rolling oceans, and in fighting fields,"
12192,ARGUMENT.,"Storms have I pass’d, and many a stern debate;"
12193,ARGUMENT.,And now in humbler scene submit to fate.
12194,ARGUMENT.,"What cannot want? The best she will expose,"
12195,ARGUMENT.,And I am learn’d in all her train of woes;
12196,ARGUMENT.,"She fills with navies, hosts, and loud alarms,"
12197,ARGUMENT.,"The sea, the land, and shakes the world with arms!”"
12198,ARGUMENT.,
12199,ARGUMENT.,"Thus, near the gates conferring as they drew,"
12200,ARGUMENT.,"Argus, the dog, his ancient master knew:"
12201,ARGUMENT.,"He not unconscious of the voice and tread,"
12202,ARGUMENT.,"Lifts to the sound his ear, and rears his head;"
12203,ARGUMENT.,"Bred by Ulysses, nourish’d at his board,"
12204,ARGUMENT.,"But, ah! not fated long to please his lord;"
12205,ARGUMENT.,"To him, his swiftness and his strength were vain;"
12206,ARGUMENT.,The voice of glory call’d him o’er the main.
12207,ARGUMENT.,"Till then in every sylvan chase renown’d,"
12208,ARGUMENT.,"With Argus, Argus, rung the woods around;"
12209,ARGUMENT.,"With him the youth pursued the goat or fawn,"
12210,ARGUMENT.,Or traced the mazy leveret o’er the lawn.
12211,ARGUMENT.,"Now left to man’s ingratitude he lay,"
12212,ARGUMENT.,"Unhoused, neglected in the public way;"
12213,ARGUMENT.,"And where on heaps the rich manure was spread,"
12214,ARGUMENT.,"Obscene with reptiles, took his sordid bed."
12215,ARGUMENT.,
12216,ARGUMENT.,"He knew his lord; he knew, and strove to meet;"
12217,ARGUMENT.,In vain he strove to crawl and kiss his feet;
12218,ARGUMENT.,"Yet (all he could) his tail, his tears, his eyes,"
12219,ARGUMENT.,"Salute his master, and confess his joys."
12220,ARGUMENT.,Soft pity touch’d the mighty master’s soul;
12221,ARGUMENT.,"Adown his cheek a tear unbidden stole,"
12222,ARGUMENT.,Stole unperceived: he turn’d his head and dried
12223,ARGUMENT.,The drop humane: then thus impassion’d cried:
12224,ARGUMENT.,
12225,ARGUMENT.,“What noble beast in this abandon’d state
12226,ARGUMENT.,Lies here all helpless at Ulysses’ gate?
12227,ARGUMENT.,His bulk and beauty speak no vulgar praise:
12228,ARGUMENT.,"If, as he seems, he was in better days,"
12229,ARGUMENT.,Some care his age deserves; or was he prized
12230,ARGUMENT.,For worthless beauty? therefore now despised;
12231,ARGUMENT.,"Such dogs and men there are, mere things of state;"
12232,ARGUMENT.,"And always cherish’d by their friends, the great.”"
12233,ARGUMENT.,
12234,ARGUMENT.,"“Not Argus so, (Eumaeus thus rejoin’d,)"
12235,ARGUMENT.,"But served a master of a nobler kind,"
12236,ARGUMENT.,"Who, never, never shall behold him more!"
12237,ARGUMENT.,"Long, long since perish’d on a distant shore!"
12238,ARGUMENT.,"Oh had you seen him, vigorous, bold, and young,"
12239,ARGUMENT.,"Swift as a stag, and as a lion strong:"
12240,ARGUMENT.,"Him no fell savage on the plain withstood,"
12241,ARGUMENT.,None ’scaped him bosom’d in the gloomy wood;
12242,ARGUMENT.,"His eye how piercing, and his scent how true,"
12243,ARGUMENT.,To wind the vapour on the tainted dew!
12244,ARGUMENT.,"Such, when Ulysses left his natal coast:"
12245,ARGUMENT.,"Now years unnerve him, and his lord is lost!"
12246,ARGUMENT.,"The women keep the generous creature bare,"
12247,ARGUMENT.,A sleek and idle race is all their care:
12248,ARGUMENT.,"The master gone, the servants what restrains?"
12249,ARGUMENT.,Or dwells humanity where riot reigns?
12250,ARGUMENT.,"Jove fix’d it certain, that whatever day"
12251,ARGUMENT.,"Makes man a slave, takes half his worth away.”"
12252,ARGUMENT.,
12253,ARGUMENT.,"This said, the honest herdsman strode before;"
12254,ARGUMENT.,The musing monarch pauses at the door:
12255,ARGUMENT.,"The dog, whom Fate had granted to behold"
12256,ARGUMENT.,"His lord, when twenty tedious years had roll’d,"
12257,ARGUMENT.,"Takes a last look, and having seen him, dies;"
12258,ARGUMENT.,So closed for ever faithful Argus’ eyes!
12259,ARGUMENT.,
12260,ARGUMENT.,"And now Telemachus, the first of all,"
12261,ARGUMENT.,Observed Eumaeus entering in the hall;
12262,ARGUMENT.,"Distant he saw, across the shady dome;"
12263,ARGUMENT.,"Then gave a sign, and beckon’d him to come:"
12264,ARGUMENT.,"There stood an empty seat, where late was placed,"
12265,ARGUMENT.,"In order due, the steward of the feast,"
12266,ARGUMENT.,"(Who now was busied carving round the board,)"
12267,ARGUMENT.,"Eumaeus took, and placed it near his lord."
12268,ARGUMENT.,"Before him instant was the banquet spread,"
12269,ARGUMENT.,And the bright basket piled with loaves of bread.
12270,ARGUMENT.,
12271,ARGUMENT.,"Next came Ulysses lowly at the door,"
12272,ARGUMENT.,"A figure despicable, old, and poor."
12273,ARGUMENT.,"In squalid vests, with many a gaping rent,"
12274,ARGUMENT.,"Propp’d on a staff, and trembling as he went."
12275,ARGUMENT.,"Then, resting on the threshold of the gate,"
12276,ARGUMENT.,Against a cypress pillar lean’d his weight
12277,ARGUMENT.,Smooth’d by the workman to a polish’d plane);
12278,ARGUMENT.,"The thoughtful son beheld, and call’d his swain"
12279,ARGUMENT.,
12280,ARGUMENT.,"“These viands, and this bread, Eumaeus! bear,"
12281,ARGUMENT.,And let yon mendicant our plenty share:
12282,ARGUMENT.,"And let him circle round the suitors’ board,"
12283,ARGUMENT.,And try the bounty of each gracious lord.
12284,ARGUMENT.,"Bold let him ask, encouraged thus by me:"
12285,ARGUMENT.,"How ill, alas! do want and shame agree!”"
12286,ARGUMENT.,
12287,ARGUMENT.,His lord’s command the faithful servant bears:
12288,ARGUMENT.,The seeming beggar answers with his prayers:
12289,ARGUMENT.,“Bless’d be Telemachus! in every deed
12290,ARGUMENT.,Inspire him. Jove! in every wish succeed!”
12291,ARGUMENT.,"This said, the portion from his son convey’d"
12292,ARGUMENT.,With smiles receiving on his scrip he laid.
12293,ARGUMENT.,"Long has the minstrel swept the sounding wire,"
12294,ARGUMENT.,"He fed, and ceased when silence held the lyre."
12295,ARGUMENT.,"Soon as the suitors from the banquet rose,"
12296,ARGUMENT.,Minerva prompts the man of mighty woes
12297,ARGUMENT.,"To tempt their bounties with a suppliant’s art,"
12298,ARGUMENT.,And learn the generous from the ignoble heart
12299,ARGUMENT.,"(Not but his soul, resentful as humane,"
12300,ARGUMENT.,Dooms to full vengeance all the offending train);
12301,ARGUMENT.,"With speaking eyes, and voice of plaintive sound,"
12302,ARGUMENT.,"Humble he moves, imploring all around."
12303,ARGUMENT.,"The proud feel pity, and relief bestow,"
12304,ARGUMENT.,With such an image touch’d of human woe;
12305,ARGUMENT.,"Inquiring all, their wonder they confess,"
12306,ARGUMENT.,"And eye the man, majestic in distress."
12307,ARGUMENT.,
12308,ARGUMENT.,"While thus they gaze and question with their eyes,"
12309,ARGUMENT.,The bold Melanthius to their thought replies:
12310,ARGUMENT.,“My lords! this stranger of gigantic port
12311,ARGUMENT.,The good Eumaeus usher’d to your court.
12312,ARGUMENT.,"Full well I mark’d the features of his face,"
12313,ARGUMENT.,"Though all unknown his clime, or noble race.”"
12314,ARGUMENT.,
12315,ARGUMENT.,"“And is this present, swineherd! of thy band?"
12316,ARGUMENT.,Bring’st thou these vagrants to infest the land?
12317,ARGUMENT.,(Returns Antinous with retorted eye)
12318,ARGUMENT.,"Objects uncouth, to check the genial joy."
12319,ARGUMENT.,Enough of these our court already grace;
12320,ARGUMENT.,"Of giant stomach, and of famish’d face."
12321,ARGUMENT.,"Such guests Eumaeus to his country brings,"
12322,ARGUMENT.,"To share our feast, and lead the life of kings.”"
12323,ARGUMENT.,
12324,ARGUMENT.,To whom the hospitable swain rejoins:
12325,ARGUMENT.,"“Thy passion, prince, belies thy knowing mind."
12326,ARGUMENT.,"Who calls, from distant nations to his own,"
12327,ARGUMENT.,"The poor, distinguish’d by their wants alone?"
12328,ARGUMENT.,Round the wide world are sought those men divine
12329,ARGUMENT.,"Who public structures raise, or who design;"
12330,ARGUMENT.,"Those to whose eyes the gods their ways reveal,"
12331,ARGUMENT.,Or bless with salutary arts to heal;
12332,ARGUMENT.,"But chief to poets such respect belongs,"
12333,ARGUMENT.,By rival nations courted for their songs;
12334,ARGUMENT.,"These states invite, and mighty kings admire,"
12335,ARGUMENT.,Wide as the sun displays his vital fire.
12336,ARGUMENT.,It is not so with want! how few that feed
12337,ARGUMENT.,"A wretch unhappy, merely for his need!"
12338,ARGUMENT.,"Unjust to me, and all that serve the state,"
12339,ARGUMENT.,To love Ulysses is to raise thy hate.
12340,ARGUMENT.,"For me, suffice the approbation won"
12341,ARGUMENT.,"Of my great mistress, and her godlike son.”"
12342,ARGUMENT.,
12343,ARGUMENT.,To him Telemachus: “No more incense
12344,ARGUMENT.,The man by nature prone to insolence:
12345,ARGUMENT.,Injurious minds just answers but provoke”—
12346,ARGUMENT.,"Then turning to Antinous, thus he spoke:"
12347,ARGUMENT.,“Thanks to thy care! whose absolute command
12348,ARGUMENT.,Thus drives the stranger from our court and land.
12349,ARGUMENT.,Heaven bless its owner with a better mind!
12350,ARGUMENT.,"From envy free, to charity inclined."
12351,ARGUMENT.,This both Penelope and I afford:
12352,ARGUMENT.,"Then, prince! be bounteous of Ulysses’ board."
12353,ARGUMENT.,To give another’s is thy hand so slow?
12354,ARGUMENT.,So much more sweet to spoil than to bestow?”
12355,ARGUMENT.,
12356,ARGUMENT.,"“Whence, great Telemachus! this lofty strain?"
12357,ARGUMENT.,(Antinous cries with insolent disdain):
12358,ARGUMENT.,"Portions like mine if every suitor gave,"
12359,ARGUMENT.,Our walls this twelvemonth should not see the slave.”
12360,ARGUMENT.,
12361,ARGUMENT.,"He spoke, and lifting high above the board"
12362,ARGUMENT.,"His ponderous footstool, shook it at his lord."
12363,ARGUMENT.,The rest with equal hand conferr’d the bread:
12364,ARGUMENT.,"He fill’d his scrip, and to the threshold sped;"
12365,ARGUMENT.,"But first before Antinous stopp’d, and said:"
12366,ARGUMENT.,"“Bestow, my friend! thou dost not seem the worst"
12367,ARGUMENT.,"Of all the Greeks, but prince-like and the first;"
12368,ARGUMENT.,"Then, as in dignity, be first in worth,"
12369,ARGUMENT.,And I shall praise thee through the boundless earth.
12370,ARGUMENT.,Once I enjoy’d in luxury of state
12371,ARGUMENT.,Whate’er gives man the envied name of great;
12372,ARGUMENT.,"Wealth, servants, friends, were mine in better days"
12373,ARGUMENT.,And hospitality was then my praise;
12374,ARGUMENT.,"In every sorrowing soul I pour’d delight,"
12375,ARGUMENT.,And poverty stood smiling in my sight.
12376,ARGUMENT.,"But Jove, all-governing, whose only will"
12377,ARGUMENT.,"Determines fate, and mingles good with ill,"
12378,ARGUMENT.,Sent me (to punish my pursuit of gain)
12379,ARGUMENT.,With roving pirates o’er the Egyptian main
12380,ARGUMENT.,By Egypt’s silver flood our ships we moor;
12381,ARGUMENT.,Our spies commission’d straight the coast explore;
12382,ARGUMENT.,"But impotent of mind, the lawless will"
12383,ARGUMENT.,"The country ravage, and the natives kill."
12384,ARGUMENT.,"The spreading clamour to their city flies,"
12385,ARGUMENT.,And horse and foot in mingled tumults rise:
12386,ARGUMENT.,"The reddening dawn reveals the hostile fields,"
12387,ARGUMENT.,"Horrid with bristly spears, and gleaming shields:"
12388,ARGUMENT.,Jove thunder’d on their side: our guilty head
12389,ARGUMENT.,We turn’d to flight; the gathering vengeance spread
12390,ARGUMENT.,"On all parts round, and heaps on heaps lay dead."
12391,ARGUMENT.,Some few the foe in servitude detain;
12392,ARGUMENT.,Death ill exchanged for bondage and for pain!
12393,ARGUMENT.,"Unhappy me a Cyprian took aboard,"
12394,ARGUMENT.,"And gave to Dmetor, Cyprus’ haughty lord:"
12395,ARGUMENT.,"Hither, to ’scape his chains, my course I steer,"
12396,ARGUMENT.,"Still cursed by Fortune, and insulted here!”"
12397,ARGUMENT.,
12398,ARGUMENT.,To whom Antinous thus his rage express’d:
12399,ARGUMENT.,“What god has plagued us with this gourmand guest?
12400,ARGUMENT.,"Unless at distance, wretch! thou keep behind,"
12401,ARGUMENT.,"Another isle, than Cyprus more unkind,"
12402,ARGUMENT.,Another Egypt shalt thou quickly find.
12403,ARGUMENT.,"From all thou begg’st, a bold audacious slave;"
12404,ARGUMENT.,Nor all can give so much as thou canst crave.
12405,ARGUMENT.,"Nor wonder I, at such profusion shown;"
12406,ARGUMENT.,"Shameless they give, who give what’s not their own.”"
12407,ARGUMENT.,
12408,ARGUMENT.,"The chief, retiring: “Souls, like that in thee,"
12409,ARGUMENT.,Ill suits such forms of grace and dignity.
12410,ARGUMENT.,Nor will that hand to utmost need afford
12411,ARGUMENT.,"The smallest portion of a wasteful board,"
12412,ARGUMENT.,"Whose luxury whole patrimonies sweeps,"
12413,ARGUMENT.,"Yet starving want, amidst the riot, weeps.”"
12414,ARGUMENT.,
12415,ARGUMENT.,"The haughty suitor with resentment burns,"
12416,ARGUMENT.,"And, sourly smiling, this reply returns:"
12417,ARGUMENT.,"“Take that, ere yet thou quit this princely throng;"
12418,ARGUMENT.,And dumb for ever be thy slanderous tongue!”
12419,ARGUMENT.,"He said, and high the whirling tripod flung."
12420,ARGUMENT.,His shoulder-blade received the ungentle shock;
12421,ARGUMENT.,"He stood, and moved not, like a marble rock;"
12422,ARGUMENT.,"But shook his thoughtful head, nor more complain’d,"
12423,ARGUMENT.,"Sedate of soul, his character sustain’d,"
12424,ARGUMENT.,And inly form’d revenge; then back withdrew:
12425,ARGUMENT.,"Before his feet the well fill’d scrip he threw,"
12426,ARGUMENT.,And thus with semblance mild address’d the crew:
12427,ARGUMENT.,
12428,ARGUMENT.,"“May what I speak your princely minds approve,"
12429,ARGUMENT.,Ye peers and rivals in this noble love!
12430,ARGUMENT.,"Not for the hurt I grieve, but for the cause."
12431,ARGUMENT.,"If, when the sword our country’s quarrel draws,"
12432,ARGUMENT.,"Or if, defending what is justly dear,"
12433,ARGUMENT.,"From Mars impartial some broad wound we bear,"
12434,ARGUMENT.,The generous motive dignifies the scar.
12435,ARGUMENT.,"But for mere want, how hard to suffer wrong!"
12436,ARGUMENT.,Want brings enough of other ills along!
12437,ARGUMENT.,"Yet, if injustice never be secure,"
12438,ARGUMENT.,"If fiends revenge, and gods assert the poor,"
12439,ARGUMENT.,"Death shall lay low the proud aggressor’s head,"
12440,ARGUMENT.,And make the dust Antinous’ bridal bed.”
12441,ARGUMENT.,
12442,ARGUMENT.,"“Peace, wretch! and eat thy bread without offence"
12443,ARGUMENT.,"(The suitor cried), or force shall drag thee hence,"
12444,ARGUMENT.,"Scourge through the public street, and cast thee there,"
12445,ARGUMENT.,A mangled carcase for the hounds to tear.”
12446,ARGUMENT.,
12447,ARGUMENT.,"His furious deed the general anger moved,"
12448,ARGUMENT.,"All, even the worst, condemn’d; and some reproved."
12449,ARGUMENT.,“Was ever chief for wars like these renown’d?
12450,ARGUMENT.,Ill fits the stranger and the poor to wound.
12451,ARGUMENT.,Unbless’d thy hand! if in this low disguise
12452,ARGUMENT.,"Wander, perhaps, some inmate of the skies;"
12453,ARGUMENT.,They (curious oft of mortal actions) deign
12454,ARGUMENT.,"In forms like these to round the earth and main,"
12455,ARGUMENT.,"Just and unjust recording in their mind,"
12456,ARGUMENT.,And with sure eyes inspecting all mankind.”
12457,ARGUMENT.,
12458,ARGUMENT.,"Telemachus, absorb’d in thought severe,"
12459,ARGUMENT.,"Nourish’d deep anguish, though he shed no tear;"
12460,ARGUMENT.,But the dark brow of silent sorrow shook:
12461,ARGUMENT.,While thus his mother to her virgins spoke:
12462,ARGUMENT.,
12463,ARGUMENT.,“On him and his may the bright god of day
12464,ARGUMENT.,"That base, inhospitable blow repay!”"
12465,ARGUMENT.,"The nurse replies: “If Jove receives my prayer,"
12466,ARGUMENT.,Not one survives to breathe to-morrow’s air.”
12467,ARGUMENT.,
12468,ARGUMENT.,"“All, all are foes, and mischief is their end;"
12469,ARGUMENT.,Antinous most to gloomy death a friend
12470,ARGUMENT.,"(Replies the queen): the stranger begg’d their grace,"
12471,ARGUMENT.,And melting pity soften’d every face;
12472,ARGUMENT.,"From every other hand redress he found,"
12473,ARGUMENT.,But fell Antinous answer’d with a wound.”
12474,ARGUMENT.,"Amidst her maids thus spoke the prudent queen,"
12475,ARGUMENT.,Then bade Eumaeus call the pilgrim in.
12476,ARGUMENT.,"“Much of the experienced man I long to hear,"
12477,ARGUMENT.,"If or his certain eye, or listening ear,"
12478,ARGUMENT.,Have learn’d the fortunes of my wandering lord?”
12479,ARGUMENT.,"Thus she, and good Eumaeus took the word:"
12480,ARGUMENT.,
12481,ARGUMENT.,"“A private audience if thy grace impart,"
12482,ARGUMENT.,The stranger’s words may ease the royal heart.
12483,ARGUMENT.,"His sacred eloquence in balm distils,"
12484,ARGUMENT.,And the soothed heart with secret pleasure fills.
12485,ARGUMENT.,"Three days have spent their beams, three nights have run"
12486,ARGUMENT.,"Their silent journey, since his tale begun,"
12487,ARGUMENT.,Unfinish’d yet; and yet I thirst to hear!
12488,ARGUMENT.,As when some heaven-taught poet charms the ear
12489,ARGUMENT.,(Suspending sorrow with celestial strain
12490,ARGUMENT.,Breathed from the gods to soften human pain)
12491,ARGUMENT.,"Time steals away with unregarded wing,"
12492,ARGUMENT.,"And the soul hears him, though he cease to sing"
12493,ARGUMENT.,
12494,ARGUMENT.,"“Ulysses late he saw, on Cretan ground"
12495,ARGUMENT.,"(His fathers guest), for Minos’ birth renown’d."
12496,ARGUMENT.,"He now but waits the wind to waft him o’er,"
12497,ARGUMENT.,"With boundless treasure, from Thesprotia’s shore.”"
12498,ARGUMENT.,
12499,ARGUMENT.,"To this the queen: “The wanderer let me hear,"
12500,ARGUMENT.,"While yon luxurious race indulge their cheer,"
12501,ARGUMENT.,"Devour the grazing ox, and browsing goat,"
12502,ARGUMENT.,And turn my generous vintage down their throat.
12503,ARGUMENT.,"For where’s an arm, like thine, Ulysses! strong,"
12504,ARGUMENT.,"To curb wild riot, and to punish wrong?”"
12505,ARGUMENT.,
12506,ARGUMENT.,She spoke. Telemachus then sneezed aloud;
12507,ARGUMENT.,"Constrain’d, his nostril echoed through the crowd."
12508,ARGUMENT.,The smiling queen the happy omen bless’d:
12509,ARGUMENT.,
12510,ARGUMENT.,"“So may these impious fall, by Fate oppress’d!”"
12511,ARGUMENT.,"Then to Eumaeus: “Bring the stranger, fly!"
12512,ARGUMENT.,"And if my questions meet a true reply,"
12513,ARGUMENT.,"Graced with a decent robe he shall retire,"
12514,ARGUMENT.,A gift in season which his wants require.”
12515,ARGUMENT.,
12516,ARGUMENT.,Thus spoke Penelope. Eumaeus flies
12517,ARGUMENT.,"In duteous haste, and to Ulysses cries:"
12518,ARGUMENT.,"“The queen invites thee, venerable guest!"
12519,ARGUMENT.,"A secret instinct moves her troubled breast,"
12520,ARGUMENT.,Of her long absent lord from thee to gain
12521,ARGUMENT.,"Some light, and soothe her soul’s eternal pain."
12522,ARGUMENT.,"If true, if faithful thou, her grateful mind"
12523,ARGUMENT.,Of decent robes a present has design’d:
12524,ARGUMENT.,"So finding favour in the royal eye,"
12525,ARGUMENT.,Thy other wants her subjects shall supply.”
12526,ARGUMENT.,
12527,ARGUMENT.,“Fair truth alone (the patient man replied)
12528,ARGUMENT.,"My words shall dictate, and my lips shall guide."
12529,ARGUMENT.,"To him, to me, one common lot was given,"
12530,ARGUMENT.,"In equal woes, alas! involved by Heaven."
12531,ARGUMENT.,Much of his fates I know; but check’d by fear
12532,ARGUMENT.,I stand; the hand of violence is here:
12533,ARGUMENT.,"Here boundless wrongs the starry skies invade,"
12534,ARGUMENT.,And injured suppliants seek in vain for aid.
12535,ARGUMENT.,"Let for a space the pensive queen attend,"
12536,ARGUMENT.,Nor claim my story till the sun descend;
12537,ARGUMENT.,"Then in such robes as suppliants may require,"
12538,ARGUMENT.,"Composed and cheerful by the genial fire,"
12539,ARGUMENT.,"When loud uproar and lawless riot cease,"
12540,ARGUMENT.,Shall her pleased ear receive my words in peace.”
12541,ARGUMENT.,
12542,ARGUMENT.,Swift to the queen returns the gentle swain:
12543,ARGUMENT.,"“And say (she cries), does fear or shame detain"
12544,ARGUMENT.,The cautious stranger? With the begging kind
12545,ARGUMENT.,Shame suits but ill.” Eumaeus thus rejoin’d:
12546,ARGUMENT.,
12547,ARGUMENT.,"“He only asks a more propitious hour,"
12548,ARGUMENT.,And shuns (who would not?) wicked men in power;
12549,ARGUMENT.,At evening mild (meet season to confer)
12550,ARGUMENT.,"By turns to question, and by turns to hear.”"
12551,ARGUMENT.,
12552,ARGUMENT.,“Whoe’er this guest (the prudent queen replies)
12553,ARGUMENT.,His every step and every thought is wise.
12554,ARGUMENT.,For men like these on earth he shall not find
12555,ARGUMENT.,In all the miscreant race of human kind.”
12556,ARGUMENT.,"Thus she. Eumaeus all her words attends,"
12557,ARGUMENT.,"And, parting, to the suitor powers descends;"
12558,ARGUMENT.,"There seeks Telemachus, and thus apart"
12559,ARGUMENT.,In whispers breathes the fondness of his heart:
12560,ARGUMENT.,
12561,ARGUMENT.,"“The time, my lord, invites me to repair"
12562,ARGUMENT.,Hence to the lodge; my charge demands my care.
12563,ARGUMENT.,These sons of murder thirst thy life to take;
12564,ARGUMENT.,"O guard it, guard it, for thy servant’s sake!”"
12565,ARGUMENT.,
12566,ARGUMENT.,“Thanks to my friend (he cries): but now the hour
12567,ARGUMENT.,"Of night draws on, go seek the rural bower:"
12568,ARGUMENT.,But first refresh: and at the dawn of day
12569,ARGUMENT.,Hither a victim to the gods convey.
12570,ARGUMENT.,"Our life to Heaven’s immortal powers we trust,"
12571,ARGUMENT.,"Safe in their care, for Heaven protects the just.”"
12572,ARGUMENT.,
12573,ARGUMENT.,"Observant of his voice, Eumaeus sate"
12574,ARGUMENT.,And fed recumbent on a chair of state.
12575,ARGUMENT.,"Then instant rose, and as he moved along,"
12576,ARGUMENT.,"’Twas riot all amid the suitor throng,"
12577,ARGUMENT.,"They feast, they dance, and raise the mirthful song"
12578,ARGUMENT.,"Till now, declining towards the close of day,"
12579,ARGUMENT.,The sun obliquely shot his dewy ray.

13952,ARGUMENT.,"“O thou, of mortals most inured to woes!"
13953,ARGUMENT.,Why roll those eyes unfriended of repose?
13954,ARGUMENT.,Beneath thy palace-roof forget thy care;
13955,ARGUMENT.,Bless’d in thy queen! bless’d in thy blooming heir!
13956,ARGUMENT.,"Whom, to the gods when suppliant fathers bow"
13957,ARGUMENT.,They name the standard of their dearest vow.”
13958,ARGUMENT.,
13959,ARGUMENT.,"“Just is thy kind reproach (the chief rejoin’d),"
13960,ARGUMENT.,"Deeds full of fate distract my various mind,"
13961,ARGUMENT.,In contemplation wrapp’d. This hostile crew
13962,ARGUMENT.,What single arm hath prowess to subdue?
13963,ARGUMENT.,"Or if, by Jove’s and thy auxiliar aid,"
13964,ARGUMENT.,"They’re doom’d to bleed; O say, celestial maid!"
13965,ARGUMENT.,"Where shall Ulysses shun, or how sustain"
13966,ARGUMENT.,Nations embattled to revenge the slain?”
13967,ARGUMENT.,
13968,ARGUMENT.,"“Oh impotence of faith! (Minerva cries,)"
13969,ARGUMENT.,"If man on frail unknowing man relies,"
13970,ARGUMENT.,"Doubt you the gods? Lo, Pallas self descends,"
13971,ARGUMENT.,"Inspires thy counsels, and thy toils attends."
13972,ARGUMENT.,"In me affianced, fortify thy breast,"
13973,ARGUMENT.,Though myriads leagued thy rightful claim contest
13974,ARGUMENT.,"My sure divinity shall bear the shield,"
13975,ARGUMENT.,And edge thy sword to reap the glorious field.
13976,ARGUMENT.,"Now, pay the debt to craving nature due,"
13977,ARGUMENT.,Her faded powers with balmy rest renew.”
13978,ARGUMENT.,"She ceased, ambrosial slumbers seal his eyes;"
13979,ARGUMENT.,Her care dissolves in visionary joys
13980,ARGUMENT.,"The goddess, pleased, regains her natal skies."
13981,ARGUMENT.,
13982,ARGUMENT.,Not so the queen; the downy bands of sleep
13983,ARGUMENT.,By grief relax’d she waked again to weep:
13984,ARGUMENT.,A gloomy pause ensued of dumb despair;
13985,ARGUMENT.,"Then thus her fate invoked, with fervent prayer"
13986,ARGUMENT.,
13987,ARGUMENT.,"“Diana! speed thy deathful ebon dart,"
13988,ARGUMENT.,And cure the pangs of this convulsive heart.
13989,ARGUMENT.,"Snatch me, ye whirlwinds! far from human race,"
13990,ARGUMENT.,Toss’d through the void illimitable space
13991,ARGUMENT.,"Or if dismounted from the rapid cloud,"
13992,ARGUMENT.,Me with his whelming wave let Ocean shroud!
13993,ARGUMENT.,"So, Pandarus, thy hopes, three orphan fair,"
13994,ARGUMENT.,Were doom’d to wander through the devious air;
13995,ARGUMENT.,"Thyself untimely, and thy consort died,"
13996,ARGUMENT.,But four celestials both your cares supplied.
13997,ARGUMENT.,Venus in tender delicacy rears
13998,ARGUMENT.,"With honey, milk, and wine their infant years;"
13999,ARGUMENT.,Imperial Juno to their youth assigned
14000,ARGUMENT.,"A form majestic, and sagacious mind;"
14001,ARGUMENT.,With shapely growth Diana graced their bloom;
14002,ARGUMENT.,And Pallas taught the texture of the loom.
14003,ARGUMENT.,"But whilst, to learn their lots in nuptial love,"
14004,ARGUMENT.,Bright Cytherea sought the bower of Jove
14005,ARGUMENT.,"(The God supreme, to whose eternal eye"
14006,ARGUMENT.,The registers of fate expanded lie);
14007,ARGUMENT.,"Wing’d Harpies snatch the unguarded charge away,"
14008,ARGUMENT.,And to the Furies bore a grateful prey.
14009,ARGUMENT.,"Be such my lot! Or thou, Diana, speed"
14010,ARGUMENT.,"Thy shaft, and send me joyful to the dead;"
14011,ARGUMENT.,"To seek my lord among the warrior train,"
14012,ARGUMENT.,Ere second vows my bridal faith profane.
14013,ARGUMENT.,"When woes the waking sense alone assail,"
14014,ARGUMENT.,"Whilst Night extends her soft oblivious veil,"
14015,ARGUMENT.,Of other wretches’ care the torture ends;
14016,ARGUMENT.,No truce the warfare of my heart suspends!
14017,ARGUMENT.,"The night renews the day distracting theme,"
14018,ARGUMENT.,And airy terrors sable every dream.
14019,ARGUMENT.,"The last alone a kind illusion wrought,"
14020,ARGUMENT.,"And to my bed my loved Ulysses brought,"
14021,ARGUMENT.,"In manly bloom, and each majestic grace,"
14022,ARGUMENT.,As when for Troy he left my fond embrace;
14023,ARGUMENT.,"Such raptures in my beating bosom rise,"
14024,ARGUMENT.,I deem it sure a vision of the skies.”
14025,ARGUMENT.,
14026,ARGUMENT.,"Thus, whilst Aurora mounts her purple throne,"
14027,ARGUMENT.,In audible laments she breathes her moan;
14028,ARGUMENT.,The sounds assault Ulysses’ wakeful ear;
14029,ARGUMENT.,"Misjudging of the cause, a sudden fear"
14030,ARGUMENT.,"Of his arrival known, the chief alarms;"
14031,ARGUMENT.,He thinks the queen is rushing to his arms.
14032,ARGUMENT.,"Upspringing from his couch, with active haste"
14033,ARGUMENT.,The fleece and carpet in the dome he placed
14034,ARGUMENT.,"(The hide, without, imbibed the morning air);"
14035,ARGUMENT.,And thus the gods invoked with ardent prayer:
14036,ARGUMENT.,
14037,ARGUMENT.,"“Jove, and eternal thrones! with heaven to friend,"
14038,ARGUMENT.,If the long series of my woes shall end;
14039,ARGUMENT.,"Of human race now rising from repose,"
14040,ARGUMENT.,Let one a blissful omen here disclose;
14041,ARGUMENT.,"And, to confirm my faith, propitious Jove!"
14042,ARGUMENT.,Vouchsafe the sanction of a sign above.”
14043,ARGUMENT.,
14044,ARGUMENT.,"Whilst lowly thus the chief adoring bows,"
14045,ARGUMENT.,The pitying god his guardian aid avows.
14046,ARGUMENT.,Loud from a sapphire sky his thunder sounds;
14047,ARGUMENT.,With springing hope the hero’s heart rebounds.
14048,ARGUMENT.,"Soon, with consummate joy to crown his prayer,"
14049,ARGUMENT.,An omen’d voice invades his ravish’d ear.
14050,ARGUMENT.,"Beneath a pile that close the dome adjoin’d,"
14051,ARGUMENT.,Twelve female slaves the gift of Ceres grind;
14052,ARGUMENT.,Task’d for the royal board to bolt the bran
14053,ARGUMENT.,From the pure flour (the growth and strength of man)
14054,ARGUMENT.,"Discharging to the day the labour due,"
14055,ARGUMENT.,Now early to repose the rest withdrew;
14056,ARGUMENT.,"One maid unequal to the task assign’d,"
14057,ARGUMENT.,Still turn’d the toilsome mill with anxious mind;
14058,ARGUMENT.,And thus in bitterness of soul divined:
14059,ARGUMENT.,
14060,ARGUMENT.,"“Father of gods and men, whose thunders roll"
14061,ARGUMENT.,"O’er the cerulean vault, and shake the pole:"
14062,ARGUMENT.,Whoe’er from Heaven has gain’d this rare ostent
14063,ARGUMENT.,"(Of granted vows a certain signal sent),"
14064,ARGUMENT.,"In this blest moment of accepted prayer,"
14065,ARGUMENT.,"Piteous, regard a wretch consumed with care!"
14066,ARGUMENT.,"Instant, O Jove! confound the suitor-train,"
14067,ARGUMENT.,For whom o’ertoil’d I grind the golden grain:
14068,ARGUMENT.,"Far from this dome the lewd devourers cast,"
14069,ARGUMENT.,And be this festival decreed their last!”
14070,ARGUMENT.,
14071,ARGUMENT.,"Big with their doom denounced in earth and sky,"
14072,ARGUMENT.,Ulysses’ heart dilates with secret joy.
14073,ARGUMENT.,Meantime the menial train with unctious wood
14074,ARGUMENT.,"Heap’d high the genial hearth, Vulcanian food:"
14075,ARGUMENT.,"When, early dress’d, advanced the royal heir;"
14076,ARGUMENT.,With manly grasp he waved a martial spear;
14077,ARGUMENT.,"A radiant sabre graced his purple zone,"
14078,ARGUMENT.,And on his foot the golden sandal shone.
14079,ARGUMENT.,His steps impetuous to the portal press’d;
14080,ARGUMENT.,And Euryclea thus he there address’d:
14081,ARGUMENT.,
14082,ARGUMENT.,"“Say thou to whom my youth its nurture owes,"
14083,ARGUMENT.,Was care for due refection and repose
14084,ARGUMENT.,"Bestow’d the stranger-guest? Or waits he grieved,"
14085,ARGUMENT.,"His age not honour’d, nor his wants relieved?"
14086,ARGUMENT.,Promiscuous grace on all the queen confers
14087,ARGUMENT.,"(In woes bewilder’d, oft the wisest errs)."
14088,ARGUMENT.,"The wordy vagrant to the dole aspires,"
14089,ARGUMENT.,And modest worth with noble scorn retires.”
14090,ARGUMENT.,
14091,ARGUMENT.,She thus: “O cease that ever-honour’d name
14092,ARGUMENT.,"To blemish now: it ill deserves your blame,"
14093,ARGUMENT.,A bowl of generous wine sufficed the guest;
14094,ARGUMENT.,In vain the queen the night refection press’d;
14095,ARGUMENT.,"Nor would he court repose in downy state,"
14096,ARGUMENT.,"Unbless’d, abandon’d to the rage of Fate!"
14097,ARGUMENT.,"A hide beneath the portico was spread,"
14098,ARGUMENT.,And fleecy skins composed an humble bed;
14099,ARGUMENT.,"A downy carpet cast with duteous care,"
14100,ARGUMENT.,Secured him from the keen nocturnal air.”
14101,ARGUMENT.,
14102,ARGUMENT.,"His cornel javelin poised with regal port,"
14103,ARGUMENT.,"To the sage Greeks convened in Themis’ court,"
14104,ARGUMENT.,Forth-issuing from the dome the prince repair’d;
14105,ARGUMENT.,"Two dogs of chase, a lion-hearted guard,"
14106,ARGUMENT.,Behind him sourly stalked. Without delay
14107,ARGUMENT.,The dame divides the labour of the day;
14108,ARGUMENT.,Thus urging to the toil the menial train;
14109,ARGUMENT.,
14110,ARGUMENT.,“What marks of luxury the marble stain
14111,ARGUMENT.,Its wonted lustre let the floor regain;
14112,ARGUMENT.,The seats with purple clothe in order due;
14113,ARGUMENT.,And let the abstersive sponge the board renew;
14114,ARGUMENT.,Let some refresh the vase’s sullied mould;
14115,ARGUMENT.,Some bid the goblets boast their native gold;
14116,ARGUMENT.,"Some to the spring, with each a jar, repair,"
14117,ARGUMENT.,And copious waters pure for bathing bear;
14118,ARGUMENT.,Dispatch! for soon the suitors will essay
14119,ARGUMENT.,The lunar feast-rites to the god of day.”
14120,ARGUMENT.,
14121,ARGUMENT.,She said: with duteous haste a bevy fair
14122,ARGUMENT.,Of twenty virgins to the spring repair;
14123,ARGUMENT.,With varied toils the rest adorn the dome.
14124,ARGUMENT.,"Magnificent, and blithe, the suitors come."
14125,ARGUMENT.,Some wield the sounding axe; the dodder’d oaks
14126,ARGUMENT.,"Divide, obedient to the forceful strokes."
14127,ARGUMENT.,"Soon from the fount, with each a brimming urn"
14128,ARGUMENT.,"(Eumaeus in their train), the maids return."
14129,ARGUMENT.,"Three porkers for the feast, all brawny-chined,"
14130,ARGUMENT.,He brought; the choicest of the tusky-kind;
14131,ARGUMENT.,"In lodgments first secure his care he viewed,"
14132,ARGUMENT.,Then to the king this friendly speech renew’d:
14133,ARGUMENT.,"“Now say sincere, my guest! the suitor-train"
14134,ARGUMENT.,Still treat thy worth with lordly dull disdain;
14135,ARGUMENT.,Or speaks their deed a bounteous mind humane?”
14136,ARGUMENT.,
14137,ARGUMENT.,“Some pitying god (Ulysses sad replied)
14138,ARGUMENT.,With vollied vengeance blast their towering pride!
14139,ARGUMENT.,"No conscious blush, no sense of right, restrains"
14140,ARGUMENT.,The tides of lust that swell the boiling veins;
14141,ARGUMENT.,"From vice to vice their appetites are toss’d,"
14142,ARGUMENT.,All cheaply sated at another’s cost!”
14143,ARGUMENT.,
14144,ARGUMENT.,"While thus the chief his woes indignant told,"
14145,ARGUMENT.,"Melanthius, master of the bearded fold,"
14146,ARGUMENT.,The goodliest goats of all the royal herd
14147,ARGUMENT.,Spontaneous to the suitors’ feast preferr’d;
14148,ARGUMENT.,Two grooms assistant bore the victims bound;
14149,ARGUMENT.,With quavering cries the vaulted roofs resound;
14150,ARGUMENT.,And to the chief austere aloud began
14151,ARGUMENT.,The wretch unfriendly to the race of man:
14152,ARGUMENT.,
14153,ARGUMENT.,"“Here vagrant, still? offensive to my lords!"
14154,ARGUMENT.,Blows have more energy than airy words;
14155,ARGUMENT.,"These arguments I’ll use: nor conscious shame,"
14156,ARGUMENT.,"Nor threats, thy bold intrusion will reclaim."
14157,ARGUMENT.,On this high feast the meanest vulgar boast
14158,ARGUMENT.,A plenteous board! Hence! seek another host!”
14159,ARGUMENT.,
14160,ARGUMENT.,"Rejoinder to the churl the king disdain’d,"
14161,ARGUMENT.,"But shook his head, and rising wrath restrain’d."
14162,ARGUMENT.,
14163,ARGUMENT.,From Cephalenia ’cross the surgy main
14164,ARGUMENT.,"Philaetius late arrived, a faithful swain."
14165,ARGUMENT.,A steer ungrateful to the bull’s embrace.
14166,ARGUMENT.,"And goats he brought, the pride of all their race;"
14167,ARGUMENT.,Imported in a shallop not his own;
14168,ARGUMENT.,The dome re-echoed to the mingl’d moan.
14169,ARGUMENT.,Straight to the guardian of the bristly kind
14170,ARGUMENT.,"He thus began, benevolent of mind:"
14171,ARGUMENT.,
14172,ARGUMENT.,"“What guest is he, of such majestic air?"
14173,ARGUMENT.,His lineage and paternal clime declare:
14174,ARGUMENT.,"Dim through the eclipse of fate, the rays divine"
14175,ARGUMENT.,Of sovereign state with faded splendour shine.
14176,ARGUMENT.,"If monarchs by the gods are plunged in woe,"
14177,ARGUMENT.,To what abyss are we foredoom’d to go!”
14178,ARGUMENT.,"Then affable he thus the chief address’d,"
14179,ARGUMENT.,Whilst with pathetic warmth his hand he press’d:
14180,ARGUMENT.,
14181,ARGUMENT.,"“Stranger, may fate a milder aspect show,"
14182,ARGUMENT.,And spin thy future with a whiter clue!
14183,ARGUMENT.,O Jove! for ever deaf to human cries;
14184,ARGUMENT.,"The tyrant, not the father of the skies!"
14185,ARGUMENT.,Unpiteous of the race thy will began!
14186,ARGUMENT.,"The fool of fate, thy manufacture, man,"
14187,ARGUMENT.,"With penury, contempt, repulse, and care,"
14188,ARGUMENT.,The galling load of life is doom’d to bear.
14189,ARGUMENT.,"Ulysses from his state a wanderer still,"
14190,ARGUMENT.,"Upbraids thy power, thy wisdom, or thy will!"
14191,ARGUMENT.,O monarch ever dear!-O man of woe!
14192,ARGUMENT.,"Fresh flow my tears, and shall for ever flow!"
14193,ARGUMENT.,"Like thee, poor stranger guest, denied his home,"
14194,ARGUMENT.,Like thee: in rags obscene decreed to roam!
14195,ARGUMENT.,"Or, haply perish’d on some distant coast,"
14196,ARGUMENT.,"In stygian gloom he glides, a pensive ghost!"
14197,ARGUMENT.,"Oh, grateful for the good his bounty gave,"
14198,ARGUMENT.,"I’ll grieve, till sorrow sink me to the grave!"
14199,ARGUMENT.,"His kind protecting hand my youth preferr’d,"
14200,ARGUMENT.,The regent of his Cephalenian herd;
14201,ARGUMENT.,With vast increase beneath my care it spreads:
14202,ARGUMENT.,A stately breed! and blackens far the meads.
14203,ARGUMENT.,"Constrain’d, the choicest beeves I thence import,"
14204,ARGUMENT.,To cram these cormorants that crowd his court:
14205,ARGUMENT.,Who in partition seek his realm to share;
14206,ARGUMENT.,"Nor human right nor wrath divine revere,"
14207,ARGUMENT.,"Since here resolved oppressive these reside,"
14208,ARGUMENT.,Contending doubts my anxious heart divide:
14209,ARGUMENT.,"Now to some foreign clime inclined to fly,"
14210,ARGUMENT.,And with the royal herd protection buy;
14211,ARGUMENT.,"Then, happier thoughts return the nodding scale,"
14212,ARGUMENT.,"Light mounts despair, alternate hopes prevail:"
14213,ARGUMENT.,"In opening prospects of ideal joy,"
14214,ARGUMENT.,My king returns; the proud usurpers die.”
14215,ARGUMENT.,
14216,ARGUMENT.,To whom the chief: “In thy capacious mind
14217,ARGUMENT.,"Since daring zeal with cool debate is join’d,"
14218,ARGUMENT.,Attend a deed already ripe in fate:
14219,ARGUMENT.,"Attest, O Jove! the truth I now relate!"
14220,ARGUMENT.,"This sacred truth attest, each genial power,"
14221,ARGUMENT.,"Who bless the board, and guard this friendly bower!"
14222,ARGUMENT.,Before thou quit the dome (nor long delay)
14223,ARGUMENT.,"Thy wish produced in act, with pleased survey,"
14224,ARGUMENT.,Thy wondering eyes shall view: his rightful reign
14225,ARGUMENT.,"By arms avow’d Ulysses shall regain,"
14226,ARGUMENT.,And to the shades devote the suitor-train.”
14227,ARGUMENT.,
14228,ARGUMENT.,"“O Jove supreme! (the raptured swain replies,)"
14229,ARGUMENT.,With deeds consummate soon the promised joys!
14230,ARGUMENT.,"These aged nerves, with new-born vigour strung,"
14231,ARGUMENT.,In that blest cause should emulate the young.”
14232,ARGUMENT.,Assents Eumaeus to the prayer address’d;
14233,ARGUMENT.,And equal ardours fire his loyal breast.
14234,ARGUMENT.,
14235,ARGUMENT.,"Meantime the suitors urge the prince’s fate,"
14236,ARGUMENT.,And deathful arts employ the dire debate:
14237,ARGUMENT.,"When in his airy tour, the bird of Jove"
14238,ARGUMENT.,Truss’d with his sinewy pounce a trembling dove;
14239,ARGUMENT.,Sinister to their hope! This omen eyed
14240,ARGUMENT.,"Amphinomus, who thus presaging cried:"
14241,ARGUMENT.,
14242,ARGUMENT.,“The gods from force and fraud the prince defend;
14243,ARGUMENT.,O peers! the sanguinary scheme suspend:
14244,ARGUMENT.,Your future thought let sable fate employ;
14245,ARGUMENT.,And give the present hour to genial joy.”
14246,ARGUMENT.,
14247,ARGUMENT.,"From council straight the assenting peerage ceased,"
14248,ARGUMENT.,And in the dome prepared the genial feast.
14249,ARGUMENT.,"Disrobed, their vests apart in order lay,"
14250,ARGUMENT.,Then all with speed succinct the victims slay:
14251,ARGUMENT.,"With sheep and shaggy goats the porkers bled,"
14252,ARGUMENT.,And the proud steer was on the marble spread.
14253,ARGUMENT.,"With fire prepared, they deal the morsels round,"
14254,ARGUMENT.,"Wine, rosy-bright, the brimming goblets crown’d,"
14255,ARGUMENT.,By sage Eumaeus borne; the purple tide
14256,ARGUMENT.,Melanthius from an ample jar supplied:
14257,ARGUMENT.,High canisters of bread Philaetius placed;
14258,ARGUMENT.,And eager all devour the rich repast.
14259,ARGUMENT.,"Disposed apart, Ulysses shares the treat;"
14260,ARGUMENT.,"A trivet table, and ignobler seat,"
14261,ARGUMENT.,The prince appoints; but to his sire assigns
14262,ARGUMENT.,"The tasteful inwards, and nectareous wines."
14263,ARGUMENT.,"“Partake, my guest (he cried), without control"
14264,ARGUMENT.,"The social feast, and drain the cheering bowl:"
14265,ARGUMENT.,"Dread not the railer’s laugh, nor ruffian’s rage;"
14266,ARGUMENT.,No vulgar roof protects thy honour’d age;
14267,ARGUMENT.,"This dome a refuge to thy wrongs shall be,"
14268,ARGUMENT.,From my great sire too soon devolved to me!
14269,ARGUMENT.,"Your violence and scorn, ye suitors, cease,"
14270,ARGUMENT.,Lest arms avenge the violated peace.”
14271,ARGUMENT.,
14272,ARGUMENT.,"Awed by the prince, so haughty, brave, and young,"
14273,ARGUMENT.,"Rage gnaw’d the lip, amazement chain’d the tongue."
14274,ARGUMENT.,"“Be patient, peers! (at length Antinous cries,)"
14275,ARGUMENT.,The threats of vain imperious youth despise:
14276,ARGUMENT.,"Would Jove permit the meditated blow,"
14277,ARGUMENT.,That stream of eloquence should cease to flow.”
14278,ARGUMENT.,
14279,ARGUMENT.,"Without reply vouchsafed, Antinous ceased:"
14280,ARGUMENT.,Meanwhile the pomp of festival increased:
14281,ARGUMENT.,By heralds rank’d; in marshall’d order move
14282,ARGUMENT.,"The city tribes, to pleased Apollo’s grove:"
14283,ARGUMENT.,"Beneath the verdure of which awful shade,"
14284,ARGUMENT.,The lunar hecatomb they grateful laid;
14285,ARGUMENT.,"Partook the sacred feast, and ritual honours paid."
14286,ARGUMENT.,"But the rich banquet, in the dome prepared"
14287,ARGUMENT.,(An humble sideboard set) Ulysses shared.
14288,ARGUMENT.,"Observant of the prince’s high behest,"
14289,ARGUMENT.,His menial train attend the stranger-guest;
14290,ARGUMENT.,"Whom Pallas with unpardoning fury fired,"
14291,ARGUMENT.,By lordly pride and keen reproach inspired.
14292,ARGUMENT.,"A Samian peer, more studious than the rest"
14293,ARGUMENT.,"Of vice, who teem’d with many a dead-born jest;"
14294,ARGUMENT.,"And urged, for title to a consort queen,"
14295,ARGUMENT.,Unnumber’d acres arable and green
14296,ARGUMENT.,"(Ctesippus named); this lord Ulysses eyed,"
14297,ARGUMENT.,And thus burst out the imposthumate with pride:
14298,ARGUMENT.,
14299,ARGUMENT.,"“The sentence I propose, ye peers, attend:"
14300,ARGUMENT.,"Since due regard must wait the prince’s friend,"
14301,ARGUMENT.,Let each a token of esteem bestow:
14302,ARGUMENT.,This gift acquits the dear respect I owe;
14303,ARGUMENT.,"With which he nobly may discharge his seat,"
14304,ARGUMENT.,And pay the menials for a master’s treat.”
14305,ARGUMENT.,
14306,ARGUMENT.,"He said: and of the steer before him placed,"
14307,ARGUMENT.,"That sinewy fragment at Ulysses cast,"
14308,ARGUMENT.,"Where to the pastern-bone, by nerves combined,"
14309,ARGUMENT.,The well-horn’d foot indissolubly join’d;
14310,ARGUMENT.,"Which whizzing high, the wall unseemly sign’d."
14311,ARGUMENT.,The chief indignant grins a ghastly smile;
14312,ARGUMENT.,Revenge and scorn within his bosom boil:
14313,ARGUMENT.,When thus the prince with pious rage inflamed:
14314,ARGUMENT.,“Had not the inglorious wound thy malice aim’d
14315,ARGUMENT.,"Fall’n guiltless of the mark, my certain spear"
14316,ARGUMENT.,Had made thee buy the brutal triumph dear:
14317,ARGUMENT.,Nor should thy sire a queen his daughter boast;
14318,ARGUMENT.,"The suitor, now, had vanish’d in a ghost:"
14319,ARGUMENT.,"No more, ye lewd compeers, with lawless power"
14320,ARGUMENT.,"Invade my dome, my herds and flocks devour:"
14321,ARGUMENT.,"For genuine worth, of age mature to know,"
14322,ARGUMENT.,"My grape shall redden, and my harvest grow"
14323,ARGUMENT.,"Or, if each other’s wrongs ye still support,"
14324,ARGUMENT.,With rapes and riot to profane my court;
14325,ARGUMENT.,What single arm with numbers can contend?
14326,ARGUMENT.,"On me let all your lifted swords descend,"
14327,ARGUMENT.,And with my life such vile dishonours end.”
14328,ARGUMENT.,
14329,ARGUMENT.,"A long cessation of discourse ensued,"
14330,ARGUMENT.,By gentler Agelaus thus renew’d:
14331,ARGUMENT.,
14332,ARGUMENT.,"“A just reproof, ye peers! your rage restrain"
14333,ARGUMENT.,"From the protected guest, and menial train:"
14334,ARGUMENT.,"And, prince! to stop the source of future ill,"
14335,ARGUMENT.,"Assent yourself, and gain the royal will."
14336,ARGUMENT.,"Whilst hope prevail’d to see your sire restored,"
14337,ARGUMENT.,Of right the queen refused a second lord:
14338,ARGUMENT.,"But who so vain of faith, so blind to fate,"
14339,ARGUMENT.,To think he still survives to claim the state?
14340,ARGUMENT.,Now press the sovereign dame with warm desire
14341,ARGUMENT.,"To wed, as wealth or worth her choice inspire:"
14342,ARGUMENT.,The lord selected to the nuptial joys
14343,ARGUMENT.,Far hence will lead the long-contested prize:
14344,ARGUMENT.,"Whilst in paternal pomp with plenty bless’d,"
14345,ARGUMENT.,"You reign, of this imperial dome possess’d.”"
14346,ARGUMENT.,
14347,ARGUMENT.,Sage and serene Telemachus replies:
14348,ARGUMENT.,"“By him at whose behest the thunder flies,"

14542,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"To weep abroad, and leave to us the bow,"
14543,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,No vulgar task! Ill suits this courtly crew

14550,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"He said, but in his soul fond joys arise,"

14555,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,
14556,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Then thus Telemachus: “Some god I find

14587,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"And thrice he hoped, and thrice again he fear’d."
14588,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,The fourth had drawn it. The great sire with joy
14589,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Beheld, but with a sign forbade the boy."
14590,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"His ardour straight the obedient prince suppress’d,"
14591,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"And, artful, thus the suitor-train address’d:"

14593,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,“O lay the cause on youth yet immature!
14594,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,(For heaven forbid such weakness should endure!)
14595,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"How shall this arm, unequal to the bow,"
14596,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Retort an insult, or repel a foe?"
14597,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"But you! whom Heaven with better nerves has bless’d,"

14599,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,
14600,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"He cast the bow before him, and apart"

14612,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"With tender hands the stubborn horn he strains,"
14613,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,The stubborn horn resisted all his pains!
14614,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Already in despair he gives it o’er:

14626,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,
14627,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Thus speaking, on the floor the bow he placed"

14630,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,And to the seat returns from whence he rose.
14631,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,

14636,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Why should this bow be fatal to the brave?
14637,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Because the priest is born a peaceful slave.
14638,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Mark then what others can.” He ended there,"
14639,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,And bade Melanthius a vast pile prepare;
14640,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"He gives it instant flame, then fast beside"
14641,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Spreads o’er an ample board a bullock’s hide.

14643,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Chafe every knot, and supple every pore."
14644,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Vain all their art, and all their strength as vain;"
14645,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,The bow inflexible resists their pain.
14646,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,The force of great Eurymachus alone
14647,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"And bold Antinous, yet untired, unknown:"
14648,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Those only now remain’d; but those confess’d

14650,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,
14651,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Then from the hall, and from the noisy crew,"
14652,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,The masters of the herd and flock withdrew.
14653,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"The king observes them, he the hall forsakes,"
14654,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"And, past the limits of the court, o’ertakes."
14655,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Then thus with accent mild Ulysses spoke:
14656,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,“Ye faithful guardians of the herd and flock!
14657,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Shall I the secret of my breast conceal,"
14658,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Or (as my soul now dictates) shall I tell?
14659,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Say, should some favouring god restore again"
14660,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"The lost Ulysses to his native reign,"
14661,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,How beat your hearts? what aid would you afford
14662,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"To the proud suitors, or your ancient lord?”"
14663,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,
14664,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Philaetius thus: “O were thy word not vain!
14665,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Would mighty Jove restore that man again!
14666,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"These aged sinews, with new vigour strung,"
14667,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,In his blest cause should emulate the young.”
14668,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,With equal vows Eumaeus too implored
14669,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Each power above, with wishes for his lord."
14670,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,
14671,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"He saw their secret souls, and thus began:"
14672,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,“Those vows the gods accord; behold the man!
14673,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Your own Ulysses! twice ten years detain’d
14674,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,By woes and wanderings from this hapless land:
14675,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"At length he comes; but comes despised, unknown,"
14676,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"And finding faithful you, and you alone."
14677,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"All else have cast him from their very thought,"
14678,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,E’en in their wishes and their prayers forgot!
14679,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Hear then, my friends: If Jove this arm succeed,"
14680,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"And give yon impious revellers to bleed,"
14681,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,My care shall be to bless your future lives
14682,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,With large possessions and with faithful wives;
14683,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Fast by my palace shall your domes ascend,"
14684,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"And each on young Telemachus attend,"
14685,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,And each be call’d his brother and my friend.
14686,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"To give you firmer faith, now trust your eye;"
14687,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Lo! the broad scar indented on my thigh,"
14688,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"When with Autolycus’ sons, of yore,"
14689,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,On Parnass’ top I chased the tusky boar.”
14690,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,His ragged vest then drawn aside disclosed
14691,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"The sign conspicuous, and the scar exposed:"
14692,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Eager they view’d, with joy they stood amazed"
14693,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,With tearful eyes o’er all their master gazed:
14694,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Around his neck their longing arms they cast,"
14695,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"His head, his shoulders, and his knees embraced;"
14696,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Tears followed tears; no word was in their power;
14697,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,In solemn silence fell the kindly shower.
14698,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"The king too weeps, the king too grasps their hands;"
14699,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"And moveless, as a marble fountain, stands."
14700,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,
14701,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Thus had their joy wept down the setting sun,"
14702,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"But first the wise man ceased, and thus begun:"
14703,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"“Enough—on other cares your thought employ,"
14704,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,For danger waits on all untimely joy.
14705,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Full many foes and fierce, observe us near;"
14706,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Some may betray, and yonder walls may hear."
14707,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Re-enter then, not all at once, but stay"
14708,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Some moments you, and let me lead the way."
14709,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"To me, neglected as I am I know"
14710,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,The haughty suitors will deny the bow;
14711,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"But thou, Eumaeus, as ’tis borne away,"
14712,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Thy master’s weapon to his hand convey.
14713,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"At every portal let some matron wait,"
14714,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,And each lock fast the well-compacted gate:
14715,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Close let them keep, whate’er invades their ear;"
14716,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Though arms, or shouts, or dying groans they hear."
14717,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"To thy strict charge, Philaetius, we consign"
14718,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,The court’s main gate: to guard that pass be thine.”
14719,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,
14720,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"This said, he first return’d; the faithful swains"
14721,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"At distance follow, as their king ordains."
14722,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Before the flame Eurymachus now stands,"
14723,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"And turns the bow, and chafes it with his hands"
14724,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Still the tough bow unmoved. The lofty man
14725,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Sigh’d from his mighty soul, and thus began:"
14726,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,
14727,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"“I mourn the common cause: for, oh, my friends,"
14728,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"On me, on all, what grief, what shame attends!"
14729,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Not the lost nuptials can affect me more
14730,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"(For Greece has beauteous dames on every shore),"
14731,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,But baffled thus! confess’d so far below
14732,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Ulysses’ strength, as not to bend his bow!"
14733,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,How shall all ages our attempt deride!
14734,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Our weakness scorn!” Antinous thus replied:
14735,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,
14736,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"“Not so, Eurymachus: that no man draws"
14737,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"The wondrous bow, attend another cause."
14738,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Sacred to Phœbus is the solemn day,"
14739,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Which thoughtless we in games would waste away:
14740,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Till the next dawn this ill-timed strife forego,"
14741,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,And here leave fixed the ringlets in a row.
14742,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Now bid the sewer approach, and let us join"
14743,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"In due libations, and in rites divine,"
14744,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"So end our night: before the day shall spring,"
14745,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,The choicest offerings let Melanthius bring:
14746,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Let then to Phœbus’ name the fatted thighs
14747,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Feed the rich smokes high curling to the skies.
14748,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,So shall the patron of these arts bestow
14749,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,(For his the gift) the skill to bend the bow.”
14750,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,
14751,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,They heard well pleased: the ready heralds bring
14752,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,The cleansing waters from the limpid spring:
14753,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"The goblet high with rosy wine they crown’d,"
14754,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,In order circling to the peers around.
14755,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"That rite complete, uprose the thoughtful man,"
14756,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,And thus his meditated scheme began:
14757,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,
14758,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"“If what I ask your noble minds approve,"
14759,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Ye peers and rivals in the royal love!

14761,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"(Whose sage decision I with wonder hear),"
14762,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,And if Eurymachus the motion please:
14763,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Give Heaven this day and rest the bow in peace.
14764,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"To-morrow let your arms dispute the prize,"
14765,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"And take it he, the favour’d of the skies!"
14766,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"But, since till then this trial you delay,"
14767,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Trust it one moment to my hands to-day:
14768,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Fain would I prove, before your judging eyes,"
14769,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"What once I was, whom wretched you despise:"
14770,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,If yet this arm its ancient force retain;
14771,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Or if my woes (a long-continued train)
14772,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"And wants and insults, make me less than man.”"
14773,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,
14774,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Rage flash’d in lightning from the suitors’ eyes,"
14775,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Yet mixed with terror at the bold emprise.
14776,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Antinous then: “O miserable guest!
14777,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Is common sense quite banish’d from thy breast?
14778,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Sufficed it not, within the palace placed,"

14788,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"His nose they shorten’d, and his ears they slit,"
14789,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"And sent him sober’d home, with better wit."
14790,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Hence with long war the double race was cursed,"
14791,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Fatal to all, but to the aggressor first."

14804,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Base to insult who bears a suppliant’s name,"

14808,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Shall I, a queen, by rival chiefs adored,"

14810,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,A hope so idle never touch’d his brain:

14925,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"The bending horns, and one the string essay’d."
14926,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"From his essaying hand the string, let fly,"
14927,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Twang’d short and sharp like the shrill swallow’s cry.
14928,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"A general horror ran through all the race,"
14929,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Sunk was each heart, and pale was every face,"
14930,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Signs from above ensued: the unfolding sky
14931,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,In lightning burst; Jove thunder’d from on high.
14932,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Fired at the call of heaven’s almighty Lord,"

14936,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,
14937,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Now sitting as he was, the cord he drew,"
14938,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Through every ringlet levelling his view:
14939,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Then notch’d the shaft, released, and gave it wing;"
14940,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"The whizzing arrow vanished from the string,"
14941,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Sung on direct, and threaded every ring."
14942,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,The solid gate its fury scarcely bounds;
14943,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Pierced through and through the solid gate resounds,"
14944,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Then to the prince: “Nor have I wrought thee shame;
14945,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Nor err’d this hand unfaithful to its aim;
14946,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Nor prov’d the toil too hard; nor have I lost
14947,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"That ancient vigour, once my pride and boast."
14948,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Ill I deserved these haughty peers’ disdain;
14949,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Now let them comfort their dejected train,"
14950,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"In sweet repast their present hour employ,"
14951,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Nor wait till evening for the genial joy:

14953,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"Music, the banquet’s most refined delight.”"
14954,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,
14955,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,"He said, then gave a nod; and at the word"
14956,THE BENDING OF ULYSSES’ BOW.,Telemachus girds on his shining sword.

15081,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,Who met the point and forced it in his breast:
15082,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,"His falling hand deserts the lifted sword,"

15121,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,"Chief after chief expired at every wound,"
15122,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,And swell’d the bleeding mountain on the ground.
15123,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,Soon as his store of flying fates was spent.
15124,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,Against the wall he set the bow unbent;
15125,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,"And now his shoulders bear the massy shield,"
15126,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,And now his hands two beamy javelins wield:
15127,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,"He frowns beneath his nodding plume, that play’d"

15155,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,Melanthius or the women have betray’d—
15156,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,Oh my dear son!”—The father with a sigh

15174,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,"Him, if this arm be powerful, shall I slay?"
15175,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,"Or drive him hither, to receive the meed"

15532,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,"Thus on some tree hung struggling in the snare,"
15533,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,The doves or thrushes flap their wings in air.
15534,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,"Soon fled the soul impure, and left behind"
15535,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,The empty corse to waver with the wind.
15536,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,
15537,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,"Then forth they led Melanthius, and began"
15538,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,"Their bloody work; they lopp’d away the man,"
15539,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,Morsel for dogs! then trimm’d with brazen shears
15540,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,"The wretch, and shorten’d of his nose and ears;"
15541,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,His hands and feet last felt the cruel steel:
15542,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,"He roar’d, and torments gave his soul to hell."
15543,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,"They wash, and to Ulysses take their way:"
15544,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,So ends the bloody business of the day.
15545,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,
15546,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,To Euryclea then address’d the king:
15547,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,"“Bring hither fire, and hither sulphur bring,"
15548,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,"To purge the palace: then the queen attend,"
15549,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,And let her with her matron-train descend;
15550,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,"The matron-train, with all the virgin-band,"
15551,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,"Assemble here, to learn their lord’s command.”"
15552,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,
15553,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,"Then Euryclea: “Joyful I obey,"
15554,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,But cast those mean dishonest rags away;
15555,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,Permit me first the royal robes to bring:
15556,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,Ill suits this garb the shoulders of a king.”
15557,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,"“Bring sulphur straight, and fire” (the monarch cries)."
15558,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,"She hears, and at the word obedient flies."
15559,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,"With fire and sulphur, cure of noxious fumes,"
15560,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,"He purged the walls, and blood-polluted rooms."
15561,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,"Again the matron springs with eager pace,"
15562,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,And spreads her lord’s return from place to place.
15563,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,"They hear, rush forth, and instant round him stand,"
15564,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,"A gazing throng, a torch in every hand."
15565,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,"They saw, they knew him, and with fond embrace"
15566,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,"Each humbly kiss’d his knee, or hand, or face;"
15567,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,"He knows them all, in all such truth appears,"
15568,THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS.,E’en he indulges the sweet joy of tears.

15576,ARGUMENT.,ARGUMENT.
15577,ARGUMENT.,
15578,ARGUMENT.,
15579,ARGUMENT.,"Euryclea awakens Penelope with the news of Ulysses’ return, and the"
15580,ARGUMENT.,death of the suitors. Penelope scarcely credits her; but supposes some
15581,ARGUMENT.,"god has punished them, and descends from her department in doubt. At"
15582,ARGUMENT.,"the first interview of Ulysses and Penelope, she is quite unsatisfied."
15583,ARGUMENT.,Minerva restores him to the beauty of his youth; but the queen
15584,ARGUMENT.,"continues incredulous, till by some circumstances she is convinced, and"
15585,ARGUMENT.,falls into all the transports of passion and tenderness. They recount
15586,ARGUMENT.,to each other all that has passed during their long separation. The
15587,ARGUMENT.,"next morning Ulysses, arming himself and his friends, goes from the"
15588,ARGUMENT.,city to visit his father.
15589,ARGUMENT.,
15590,ARGUMENT.,
15591,ARGUMENT.,"Then to the queen, as in repose she lay,"
15592,ARGUMENT.,The nurse with eager rapture speeds her way:
15593,ARGUMENT.,The transports of her faithful heart supply
15594,ARGUMENT.,"A sudden youth, and give her wings to fly."
15595,ARGUMENT.,
15596,ARGUMENT.,“And sleeps my child? (the reverend matron cries)
15597,ARGUMENT.,"Ulysses lives! arise, my child, arise!"
15598,ARGUMENT.,At length appears the long-expected hour!
15599,ARGUMENT.,Ulysses comes! the suitors are no more!
15600,ARGUMENT.,No more they view the golden light of day!
15601,ARGUMENT.,"Arise, and bless thee with the glad survey?”"
15602,ARGUMENT.,
15603,ARGUMENT.,"Touch’d at her words, the mournful queen rejoin’d:"
15604,ARGUMENT.,“Ah! whither wanders thy distemper’d mind?
15605,ARGUMENT.,"The righteous powers, who tread the starry skies,"
15606,ARGUMENT.,"The weak enlighten, and confound the wise,"
15607,ARGUMENT.,"And human thought, with unresisted sway,"
15608,ARGUMENT.,"Depress or raise, enlarge or take away:"
15609,ARGUMENT.,"Truth, by their high decree, thy voice forsakes,"
15610,ARGUMENT.,And folly with the tongue of wisdom speaks.
15611,ARGUMENT.,"Unkind, the fond illusion to impose!"
15612,ARGUMENT.,Was it to flatter or deride my woes?
15613,ARGUMENT.,"Never did I sleep so sweet enjoy,"
15614,ARGUMENT.,Since my dear lord left Ithaca for Troy.
15615,ARGUMENT.,"Why must I wake to grieve, and curse thy shore,"
15616,ARGUMENT.,O Troy?—may never tongue pronounce thee more!
15617,ARGUMENT.,"Begone! another might have felt our rage,"
15618,ARGUMENT.,"But age is sacred, and we spare thy age.”"
15619,ARGUMENT.,
15620,ARGUMENT.,To whom with warmth: “My soul a lie disdains;
15621,ARGUMENT.,"Ulysses lives, thy own Ulysses reigns:"
15622,ARGUMENT.,"That stranger, patient of the suitors’ wrongs,"
15623,ARGUMENT.,And the rude license of ungovern’d tongues!
15624,ARGUMENT.,"He, he is thine! Thy son his latent guest"
15625,ARGUMENT.,"Long knew, but lock’d the secret in his breast:"
15626,ARGUMENT.,"With well concerted art to end his woes,"
15627,ARGUMENT.,And burst at once in vengeance on the foes.”
15628,ARGUMENT.,
15629,ARGUMENT.,"While yet she spoke, the queen in transport sprung"
15630,ARGUMENT.,"Swift from the couch, and round the matron hung;"
15631,ARGUMENT.,Fast from her eye descends the rolling tear:
15632,ARGUMENT.,"“Say, once more say, is my Ulysses here?"
15633,ARGUMENT.,How could that numerous and outrageous band
15634,ARGUMENT.,"By one be slain, though by a hero’s hand?”"
15635,ARGUMENT.,
15636,ARGUMENT.,"“I saw it not (she cries), but heard alone,"
15637,ARGUMENT.,"When death was busy, a loud dying groan;"
15638,ARGUMENT.,"The damsel-train turn’d pale at every wound,"
15639,ARGUMENT.,"Immured we sate, and catch’d each passing sound;"
15640,ARGUMENT.,"When death had seized her prey, thy son attends,"
15641,ARGUMENT.,And at his nod the damsel-train descends;
15642,ARGUMENT.,"There terrible in arms Ulysses stood,"
15643,ARGUMENT.,And the dead suitors almost swam in blood:
15644,ARGUMENT.,"Thy heart had leap’d the hero to survey,"
15645,ARGUMENT.,"Stern as the surly lion o’er his prey,"
15646,ARGUMENT.,"Glorious in gore, now with sulphereous fire"
15647,ARGUMENT.,"The dome he purges, now the flame aspires;"
15648,ARGUMENT.,Heap’d lie the dead without the palace walls—
15649,ARGUMENT.,"Haste, daughter, haste, thy own Ulysses calls!"
15650,ARGUMENT.,Thy every wish the bounteous gods bestow;
15651,ARGUMENT.,"Enjoy the present good, and former woe."
15652,ARGUMENT.,"Ulysses lives, his vanquish’d foes to see;"
15653,ARGUMENT.,He lives to thy Telemachus and thee!”
15654,ARGUMENT.,
15655,ARGUMENT.,"“Ah, no! (with sighs Penelope rejoin’d,)"
15656,ARGUMENT.,Excess of joy disturbs thy wandering mind;
15657,ARGUMENT.,"How blest this happy hour, should he appear,"
15658,ARGUMENT.,"Dear to us all, to me supremely dear;"
15659,ARGUMENT.,"Ah, no! some god the suitors death decreed,"
15660,ARGUMENT.,"Some god descends, and by his hand they bleed;"
15661,ARGUMENT.,"Blind! to contemn the stranger’s righteous cause,"
15662,ARGUMENT.,And violate all hospitable laws!
15663,ARGUMENT.,"The good they hated, and the powers defied!"
15664,ARGUMENT.,"But heaven is just, and by a god they died."
15665,ARGUMENT.,For never must Ulysses view this shore;
15666,ARGUMENT.,Never! the loved Ulysses is no more!”
15667,ARGUMENT.,
15668,ARGUMENT.,“What words (the matron cries) have reach’d my ears?
15669,ARGUMENT.,"Doubt we his presence, when he now appears!"
15670,ARGUMENT.,Then hear conviction: Ere the fatal day
15671,ARGUMENT.,"That forced Ulysses o’er the watery way,"
15672,ARGUMENT.,"A boar, fierce rushing in the sylvan war,"
15673,ARGUMENT.,"Plough’d half his thigh; I saw, I saw the scar,"
15674,ARGUMENT.,And wild with transport had reveal’d the wound;
15675,ARGUMENT.,"But ere I spoke, he rose, and check’d the sound."
15676,ARGUMENT.,"Then, daughter, haste away! and if a lie"
15677,ARGUMENT.,"Flow from this tongue, then let thy servant die!”"
15678,ARGUMENT.,To whom with dubious joy the queen replies:
15679,ARGUMENT.,"“Wise is thy soul, but errors seize the wise;"
15680,ARGUMENT.,The works of gods what mortal can survey?
15681,ARGUMENT.,"Who knows their motives, who shall trace their way?"
15682,ARGUMENT.,But learn we instant how the suitors trod
15683,ARGUMENT.,"The paths of death, by man, or by a god.”"
15684,ARGUMENT.,"Thus speaks the queen, and no reply attends,"
15685,ARGUMENT.,But with alternate joy and fear descends;
15686,ARGUMENT.,At every step debates her lord to prove;
15687,ARGUMENT.,"Or, rushing to his arms, confess her love!"
15688,ARGUMENT.,"Then gliding through the marble valves, in state"
15689,ARGUMENT.,"Opposed, before the shining sire she sate."
15690,ARGUMENT.,"The monarch, by a column high enthroned,"
15691,ARGUMENT.,"His eye withdrew, and fix’d it on the ground;"
15692,ARGUMENT.,Curious to hear his queen the silence break:
15693,ARGUMENT.,"Amazed she sate, and impotent to speak;"
15694,ARGUMENT.,"O’er all the man her eyes she rolls in vain,"
15695,ARGUMENT.,"Now hopes, now fears, now knows, then doubts again."
15696,ARGUMENT.,"At length Telemachus: “Oh, who can find"
15697,ARGUMENT.,A woman like Penelope unkind?
15698,ARGUMENT.,Why thus in silence? why with winning charms
15699,ARGUMENT.,Thus slow to fly with rapture to his arms?
15700,ARGUMENT.,"Stubborn the breast that with no transport glows,"
15701,ARGUMENT.,When twice ten years are pass’d of mighty woes;
15702,ARGUMENT.,"To softness lost, to spousal love unknown,"
15703,ARGUMENT.,The gods have formed that rigid heart of stone!”
15704,ARGUMENT.,"“O my Telemachus! (the queen rejoin’d,)"
15705,ARGUMENT.,Distracting fears confound my labouring mind;
15706,ARGUMENT.,"Powerless to speak. I scarce uplift my eyes,"
15707,ARGUMENT.,Nor dare to question; doubts on doubts arise.
15708,ARGUMENT.,"Oh deign he, if Ulysses, to remove"
15709,ARGUMENT.,"These boding thoughts, and what he is, to prove!”"
15710,ARGUMENT.,"Pleased with her virtuous fears, the king replies:"
15711,ARGUMENT.,"“Indulge, my son, the cautions of the wise;"
15712,ARGUMENT.,Time shall the truth to sure remembrance bring:
15713,ARGUMENT.,This garb of poverty belies the king:
15714,ARGUMENT.,"No more. This day our deepest care requires,"
15715,ARGUMENT.,Cautious to act what thought mature inspires.
15716,ARGUMENT.,"If one man’s blood, though mean, distain our hands,"
15717,ARGUMENT.,The homicide retreats to foreign lands;
15718,ARGUMENT.,"By us, in heaps the illustrious peerage falls,"
15719,ARGUMENT.,The important deed our whole attention calls.”
15720,ARGUMENT.,
15721,ARGUMENT.,“Be that thy care (Telemachus replies)
15722,ARGUMENT.,The world conspires to speak Ulysses wise;
15723,ARGUMENT.,"For wisdom all is thine! lo, I obey,"
15724,ARGUMENT.,And dauntless follow where you led the way;
15725,ARGUMENT.,Nor shalt thou in the day of danger find
15726,ARGUMENT.,Thy coward son degenerate lag behind.”
15727,ARGUMENT.,
15728,ARGUMENT.,"“Then instant to the bath (the monarch cries),"
15729,ARGUMENT.,"Bid the gay youth and sprightly virgins rise,"
15730,ARGUMENT.,"Thence all descend in pomp and proud array,"
15731,ARGUMENT.,And bid the dome resound the mirthful lay;
15732,ARGUMENT.,"While the sweet lyrist airs of rapture sings,"
15733,ARGUMENT.,"And forms the dance responsive to the strings,"
15734,ARGUMENT.,"That hence the eluded passengers may say,"
15735,ARGUMENT.,‘Lo! the queen weds! we hear the spousal lay!’
15736,ARGUMENT.,"The suitor’s death, unknown, till we remove"
15737,ARGUMENT.,"Far from the court, and act inspired by Jove.”"
15738,ARGUMENT.,
15739,ARGUMENT.,"Thus spoke the king: the observant train obey,"
15740,ARGUMENT.,"At once they bathe, and dress in proud array:"
15741,ARGUMENT.,"The lyrist strikes the string; gay youths advance,"
15742,ARGUMENT.,And fair-zoned damsels form the sprightly dance.
15743,ARGUMENT.,"The voice, attuned to instrumental sounds,"
15744,ARGUMENT.,"Ascends the roof, the vaulted roof rebounds;"
15745,ARGUMENT.,"Not unobserved: the Greeks eluded say,"
15746,ARGUMENT.,"“Lo! the queen weds, we hear the spousal lay!"
15747,ARGUMENT.,Inconstant! to admit the bridal hour.”
15748,ARGUMENT.,Thus they—but nobly chaste she weds no more.
15749,ARGUMENT.,
15750,ARGUMENT.,Meanwhile the wearied king the bath ascends;
15751,ARGUMENT.,"With faithful cares Eurynome attends,"
15752,ARGUMENT.,O’er every limb a shower of fragrance sheds;
15753,ARGUMENT.,"Then, dress’d in pomp, magnificent he treads."
15754,ARGUMENT.,The warrior-goddess gives his frame to shine
15755,ARGUMENT.,"With majesty enlarged, and grace divine."
15756,ARGUMENT.,Back from his brows in wavy ringlets fly
15757,ARGUMENT.,His thick large locks of hyacinthine dye.
15758,ARGUMENT.,As by some artist to whom Vulcan gives
15759,ARGUMENT.,"His heavenly skill, a breathing image lives;"
15760,ARGUMENT.,"By Pallas taught, he frames the wondrous mould,"
15761,ARGUMENT.,And the pale silver glows with fusile gold:
15762,ARGUMENT.,So Pallas his heroic form improves
15763,ARGUMENT.,"With bloom divine, and like a god he moves!"
15764,ARGUMENT.,"More high he treads, and issuing forth in state,"
15765,ARGUMENT.,Radiant before his gazing consort sate.
15766,ARGUMENT.,"“And, O my queen! (he cries) what power above"
15767,ARGUMENT.,"Has steel’d that heart, averse to spousal love?"
15768,ARGUMENT.,"Canst thou, Penelope, when heaven restores"
15769,ARGUMENT.,"Thy lost Ulysses to his native shores,"
15770,ARGUMENT.,"Canst thou, O cruel! unconcern’d survey"
15771,ARGUMENT.,"Thy lost Ulysses, on this signal day?"
15772,ARGUMENT.,"Haste, Euryclea, and despatchful spread"
15773,ARGUMENT.,"For me, and me alone, the imperial bed,"
15774,ARGUMENT.,My weary nature craves the balm of rest.
15775,ARGUMENT.,But Heaven with adamant has arm’d her breast.”
15776,ARGUMENT.,
15777,ARGUMENT.,"“Ah no! (she cries) a tender heart I bear,"
15778,ARGUMENT.,A foe to pride: no adamant is there;
15779,ARGUMENT.,"And now, e’en now it melts! for sure I see"
15780,ARGUMENT.,Once more Ulysses my beloved in thee!
15781,ARGUMENT.,"Fix’d in my soul, as when he sailed to Troy,"
15782,ARGUMENT.,"His image dwells: then haste the bed of joy,"
15783,ARGUMENT.,"Haste, from the bridal bower the bed translate,"
15784,ARGUMENT.,"Fram’d by his hand, and be it dress’d in state!”"
15785,ARGUMENT.,
15786,ARGUMENT.,"Thus speaks the queen, still dubious, with disguise"
15787,ARGUMENT.,"Touch’d at her words, the king with warmth replies"
15788,ARGUMENT.,“Alas for this! what mortal strength can move
15789,ARGUMENT.,"The enormous burden, who but Heaven above?"
15790,ARGUMENT.,It mocks the weak attempts of human hands!
15791,ARGUMENT.,But the whole earth must move if Heaven commands
15792,ARGUMENT.,"Then hear sure evidence, while we display"
15793,ARGUMENT.,Words seal’d with sacred truth and truth obey:
15794,ARGUMENT.,This hand the wonder framed; an olive spread
15795,ARGUMENT.,Full in the court its ever verdant head.
15796,ARGUMENT.,"Vast as some mighty column’s bulk, on high"
15797,ARGUMENT.,"The huge trunk rose, and heaved into the sky;"
15798,ARGUMENT.,"Around the tree I raised a nuptial bower,"
15799,ARGUMENT.,And roof’d defensive of the storm and shower;
15800,ARGUMENT.,"The spacious valve, with art inwrought conjoins;"
15801,ARGUMENT.,And the fair dome with polished marble shines.
15802,ARGUMENT.,I lopp’d the branchy head: aloft in twain
15803,ARGUMENT.,"Sever’d the bole, and smoothed the shining grain;"
15804,ARGUMENT.,"Then posts, capacious of the frame, I raise,"
15805,ARGUMENT.,"And bore it, regular, from space to space:"
15806,ARGUMENT.,"Athwart the frame, at equal distance lie"
15807,ARGUMENT.,"Thongs of tough hides, that boast a purple dye;"
15808,ARGUMENT.,"Then polishing the whole, the finished mould"
15809,ARGUMENT.,"With silver shone, with elephant, and gold."
15810,ARGUMENT.,"But if o’erturn’d by rude, ungovern’d hands,"
15811,ARGUMENT.,"Or still inviolate the olive stands,"
15812,ARGUMENT.,"’Tis thine, O queen, to say, and now impart,"
15813,ARGUMENT.,"If fears remain, or doubts distract thy heart.”"
15814,ARGUMENT.,
15815,ARGUMENT.,"While yet he speaks, her powers of life decay;"
15816,ARGUMENT.,"She sickens, trembles, falls, and faints away."
15817,ARGUMENT.,"At length recovering, to his arms she flew,"
15818,ARGUMENT.,"And strain’d him close, as to his breast she grew."
15819,ARGUMENT.,"The tears pour’d down amain, and “O (she cries)"
15820,ARGUMENT.,Let not against thy spouse thine anger rise!
15821,ARGUMENT.,"O versed in every turn of human art,"
15822,ARGUMENT.,Forgive the weakness of a woman’s heart!
15823,ARGUMENT.,"The righteous powers, that mortal lot dispose,"
15824,ARGUMENT.,Decree us to sustain a length of woes.
15825,ARGUMENT.,And from the flower of life the bliss deny
15826,ARGUMENT.,"To bloom together, fade away, and die."
15827,ARGUMENT.,"O let me, let me not thine anger move,"
15828,ARGUMENT.,"That I forbore, thus, thus to speak my love:"
15829,ARGUMENT.,"Thus in fond kisses, while the transport warms"
15830,ARGUMENT.,Pour out my soul and die within thine arms!
15831,ARGUMENT.,"I dreaded fraud! Men, faithless men, betray"
15832,ARGUMENT.,"Our easy faith, and make our sex their prey:"
15833,ARGUMENT.,Against the fondness of my heart I strove:
15834,ARGUMENT.,"’Twas caution, O my lord! not want of love."
15835,ARGUMENT.,"Like me had Helen fear’d, with wanton charms"
15836,ARGUMENT.,Ere the fair mischief set two worlds in arms;
15837,ARGUMENT.,Ere Greece rose dreadful in the avenging day;
15838,ARGUMENT.,"Thus had she fear’d, she had not gone astray."
15839,ARGUMENT.,"But Heaven, averse to Greece, in wrath decreed"
15840,ARGUMENT.,"That she should wander, and that Greece should bleed:"
15841,ARGUMENT.,"Blind to the ills that from injustice flow,"
15842,ARGUMENT.,She colour’d all our wretched lives with woe.
15843,ARGUMENT.,But why these sorrows when my lord arrives?
15844,ARGUMENT.,"I yield, I yield! my own Ulysses lives!"
15845,ARGUMENT.,The secrets of the bridal bed are known
15846,ARGUMENT.,"To thee, to me, to Actoris alone"
15847,ARGUMENT.,"(My father’s present in the spousal hour,"
15848,ARGUMENT.,The sole attendant on our genial bower).
15849,ARGUMENT.,"Since what no eye hath seen thy tongue reveal’d,"
15850,ARGUMENT.,"Hard and distrustful as I am, I yield.”"
15851,ARGUMENT.,
15852,ARGUMENT.,"Touch’d to the soul, the king with rapture hears,"
15853,ARGUMENT.,"Hangs round her neck, and speaks his joy in tears."
15854,ARGUMENT.,"As to the shipwreck’d mariner, the shores"
15855,ARGUMENT.,"Delightful rise, when angry Neptune roars:"
15856,ARGUMENT.,"Then, when the surge in thunder mounts the sky,"
15857,ARGUMENT.,And gulf’d in crowds at once the sailors die;
15858,ARGUMENT.,"If one, more happy, while the tempest raves,"
15859,ARGUMENT.,"Outlives the tumult of conflicting waves,"
15860,ARGUMENT.,"All pale, with ooze deform’d, he views the strand,"
15861,ARGUMENT.,And plunging forth with transport grasps the land:
15862,ARGUMENT.,"The ravish’d queen with equal rapture glows,"
15863,ARGUMENT.,"Clasps her loved lord, and to his bosom grows."
15864,ARGUMENT.,"Nor had they ended till the morning ray,"
15865,ARGUMENT.,"But Pallas backward held the rising day,"
15866,ARGUMENT.,"The wheels of night retarding, to detain"
15867,ARGUMENT.,The gay Aurora in the wavy main;
15868,ARGUMENT.,"Whose flaming steeds, emerging through the night,"
15869,ARGUMENT.,Beam o’er the eastern hills with streaming light.
15870,ARGUMENT.,
15871,ARGUMENT.,At length Ulysses with a sigh replies:
15872,ARGUMENT.,"“Yet Fate, yet cruel Fate repose denies;"
15873,ARGUMENT.,"A labour long, and hard, remains behind;"
15874,ARGUMENT.,"By heaven above, by hell beneath enjoin’d:"
15875,ARGUMENT.,For to Tiresias through the eternal gates
15876,ARGUMENT.,"Of hell I trode, to learn my future fates."
15877,ARGUMENT.,"But end we here—the night demands repose,"
15878,ARGUMENT.,"Be deck’d the couch! and peace awhile, my woes!”"
15879,ARGUMENT.,
15880,ARGUMENT.,"To whom the queen: “Thy word we shall obey,"
15881,ARGUMENT.,And deck the couch; far hence be woes away:
15882,ARGUMENT.,"Since the just gods, who tread the starry plains,"
15883,ARGUMENT.,"Restore thee safe, since my Ulysses reigns."
15884,ARGUMENT.,"But what those perils heaven decrees, impart;"
15885,ARGUMENT.,"Knowledge may grieve, but fear distracts the heart.”"
15886,ARGUMENT.,
15887,ARGUMENT.,"To this the king: “Ah, why must I disclose"
15888,ARGUMENT.,A dreadful story of approaching woes?
15889,ARGUMENT.,"Why in this hour of transport wound thy ears,"
15890,ARGUMENT.,When thou must learn what I must speak with tears?
15891,ARGUMENT.,"Heaven, by the Theban ghost, thy spouse decrees,"
15892,ARGUMENT.,"Torn from thy arms, to sail a length of seas;"
15893,ARGUMENT.,"From realm to realm, a nation to explore"
15894,ARGUMENT.,"Who ne’er knew salt, or heard the billows roar,"
15895,ARGUMENT.,"Nor saw gay vessel storm the surgy plain,"
15896,ARGUMENT.,"A painted wonder, flying on the main:"
15897,ARGUMENT.,An oar my hand must bear; a shepherd eyes
15898,ARGUMENT.,"The unknown instrument with strange surprise,"
15899,ARGUMENT.,And calls a corn-van; this upon the plain
15900,ARGUMENT.,"I fix, and hail the monarch of the main;"
15901,ARGUMENT.,Then bathe his altars with the mingled gore
15902,ARGUMENT.,"Of victims vow’d, a ram, a bull, a boar;"
15903,ARGUMENT.,"Thence swift re-sailing to my native shores,"
15904,ARGUMENT.,Due victims slay to all the ethereal powers.
15905,ARGUMENT.,"Then Heaven decrees, in peace to end my days"
15906,ARGUMENT.,And steal myself from life by slow decays!
15907,ARGUMENT.,"Unknown to pain, in age resign my breath,"
15908,ARGUMENT.,When late stern Neptune points the shaft of death;
15909,ARGUMENT.,To the dark grave retiring as to rest;
15910,ARGUMENT.,"My people blessing, by my people bless’d."
15911,ARGUMENT.,Such future scenes the all-righteous powers display
15912,ARGUMENT.,"By their dread seer, and such my future day.”"
15913,ARGUMENT.,
15914,ARGUMENT.,"To whom thus firm of soul: “If ripe for death,"
15915,ARGUMENT.,"And full of days, thou gently yield thy breath;"
15916,ARGUMENT.,"While Heaven a kind release from ills foreshows,"
15917,ARGUMENT.,"Triumph, thou happy victor of thy woes?”"
15918,ARGUMENT.,
15919,ARGUMENT.,"But Euryclea, with dispatchful care,"
15920,ARGUMENT.,"And sage Eurynome, the couch prepare;"
15921,ARGUMENT.,Instant they bid the blazing torch display
15922,ARGUMENT.,Around the dome and artificial day;
15923,ARGUMENT.,"Then to repose her steps the matron bends,"
15924,ARGUMENT.,And to the queen Eurynome descends;
15925,ARGUMENT.,"A torch she bears, to light with guiding fires"
15926,ARGUMENT.,"The royal pair; she guides them, and retires"
15927,ARGUMENT.,The instant his fair spouse Ulysses led
15928,ARGUMENT.,To the chaste love-rites of the nuptial bed.
15929,ARGUMENT.,
15930,ARGUMENT.,And now the blooming youths and sprightly fair
15931,ARGUMENT.,"Cease the gay dance, and to their rest repair;"
15932,ARGUMENT.,"But in discourse the king and consort lay,"
15933,ARGUMENT.,While the soft hours stole unperceived away;
15934,ARGUMENT.,Intent he hears Penelope disclose
15935,ARGUMENT.,"A mournful story of domestic woes,"
15936,ARGUMENT.,"His servants’ insults, his invaded bed,"
15937,ARGUMENT.,"How his whole flocks and herds exhausted bled,"
15938,ARGUMENT.,"His generous wines dishonour’d shed in vain,"
15939,ARGUMENT.,And the wild riots of the suitor-train.
15940,ARGUMENT.,"The king alternate a dire tale relates,"
15941,ARGUMENT.,"Of wars, of triumphs, and disastrous fates;"
15942,ARGUMENT.,All he unfolds; his listening spouse turns pale
15943,ARGUMENT.,With pleasing horror at the dreadful tale;
15944,ARGUMENT.,Sleepless devours each word; and hears how slain
15945,ARGUMENT.,Cicons on Cicons swell the ensanguined plain;
15946,ARGUMENT.,How to the land of Lote unbless’d he sails;
15947,ARGUMENT.,And images the rills and flowery vales!
15948,ARGUMENT.,"How dash’d like dogs, his friends the Cyclops tore"
15949,ARGUMENT.,"(Not unrevenged), and quaff’d the spouting gore;"
15950,ARGUMENT.,"How the loud storms in prison bound, he sails"
15951,ARGUMENT.,From friendly Aeolus with prosperous gales:
15952,ARGUMENT.,"Yet fate withstands! a sudden tempest roars,"
15953,ARGUMENT.,And whirls him groaning from his native shores:
15954,ARGUMENT.,"How on the barbarous Laestrigonian coast,"
15955,ARGUMENT.,By savage hands his fleet and friends lie lost;
15956,ARGUMENT.,"How scarce himself survived: he paints the bower,"
15957,ARGUMENT.,"The spells of Circe, and her magic power;"
15958,ARGUMENT.,"His dreadful journey to the realms beneath,"
15959,ARGUMENT.,To seek Tiresias in the vales of death;
15960,ARGUMENT.,How in the doleful mansions lie survey’d
15961,ARGUMENT.,"His royal mother, pale Anticlea’s shade;"
15962,ARGUMENT.,"And friends in battle slain, heroic ghosts!"
15963,ARGUMENT.,"Then how, unharm’d, he pass’d the Syren-coasts,"
15964,ARGUMENT.,"The justling rocks where fierce Charybdis raves,"
15965,ARGUMENT.,"And howling Scylla whirls her thunderous waves,"
15966,ARGUMENT.,The cave of death! How his companions slay
15967,ARGUMENT.,The oxen sacred to the god of day.
15968,ARGUMENT.,"Till Jove in wrath the rattling tempest guides,"
15969,ARGUMENT.,And whelms the offenders in the roaring tides:
15970,ARGUMENT.,How struggling through the surge he reach’d the shores
15971,ARGUMENT.,Of fair Ogygia and Calypso’s bowers;
15972,ARGUMENT.,"Where the gay blooming nymph constrain’d his stay,"
15973,ARGUMENT.,"With sweet, reluctant, amorous delay;"
15974,ARGUMENT.,"And promised, vainly promised, to bestow"
15975,ARGUMENT.,"Immortal life, exempt from age and woe:"
15976,ARGUMENT.,"How saved from storms Phæacia’s coast he trod,"
15977,ARGUMENT.,"By great Alcinous honour’d as a god,"
15978,ARGUMENT.,"Who gave him last his country to behold,"
15979,ARGUMENT.,"With change of raiment, brass, and heaps of gold"
15980,ARGUMENT.,
15981,ARGUMENT.,"He ended, sinking into sleep, and shares"
15982,ARGUMENT.,A sweet forgetfulness of all his cares.
15983,ARGUMENT.,
15984,ARGUMENT.,"Soon as soft slumber eased the toils of day,"
15985,ARGUMENT.,"Minerva rushes through the aërial way,"
15986,ARGUMENT.,And bids Aurora with her golden wheels
15987,ARGUMENT.,Flame from the ocean o’er the eastern hills;
15988,ARGUMENT.,"Uprose Ulysses from the genial bed,"
15989,ARGUMENT.,And thus with thought mature the monarch said:
15990,ARGUMENT.,
15991,ARGUMENT.,"“My queen, my consort! through a length of years"
15992,ARGUMENT.,We drank the cup of sorrow mix’d with tears;
15993,ARGUMENT.,"Thou, for thy lord; while me the immortal powers"
15994,ARGUMENT.,Detain’d reluctant from my native shores.
15995,ARGUMENT.,"Now, bless’d again by Heaven, the queen display,"
15996,ARGUMENT.,And rule our palace with an equal sway.
15997,ARGUMENT.,"Be it my care, by loans, or martial toils,"
15998,ARGUMENT.,To throng my empty folds with gifts or spoils.
15999,ARGUMENT.,But now I haste to bless Laertes’ eyes
16000,ARGUMENT.,With sight of his Ulysses ere he dies;
16001,ARGUMENT.,"The good old man, to wasting woes a prey,"
16002,ARGUMENT.,Weeps a sad life in solitude away.
16003,ARGUMENT.,"But hear, though wise! This morning shall unfold"
16004,ARGUMENT.,"The deathful scene, on heroes heroes roll’d."
16005,ARGUMENT.,"Thou with thy maids within the palace stay,"
16006,ARGUMENT.,From all the scene of tumult far away!”
16007,ARGUMENT.,
16008,ARGUMENT.,"He spoke, and sheathed in arms incessant flies"
16009,ARGUMENT.,"To wake his son, and bid his friends arise."
16010,ARGUMENT.,"“To arms!” aloud he cries; his friends obey,"
16011,ARGUMENT.,"With glittering arms their manly limbs array,"
16012,ARGUMENT.,And pass the city gate; Ulysses leads the way.

16027,ARGUMENT.,Laertes; he finds him busied in his garden all alone; the manner of his
16028,ARGUMENT.,discovery to him is beautifully described. They return together to his
16029,ARGUMENT.,"lodge, and the king is acknowledged by Dolius and the servants. The"

16071,ARGUMENT.,
16072,ARGUMENT.,“O mighty chief! (Pelides thus began)

16095,ARGUMENT.,And deluges of blood flow’d round you every way.
16096,ARGUMENT.,"Nor ceased the strife till Jove himself opposed,"
16097,ARGUMENT.,And all in Tempests the dire evening closed.
16098,ARGUMENT.,"Then to the fleet we bore thy honour’d load,"
16099,ARGUMENT.,And decent on the funeral bed bestow’d;
16100,ARGUMENT.,Then unguents sweet and tepid streams we shed;
16101,ARGUMENT.,"Tears flow’d from every eye, and o’er the dead"

16103,ARGUMENT.,"Struck at the news, thy azure mother came,"
16104,ARGUMENT.,The sea-green sisters waited on the dame:
16105,ARGUMENT.,A voice of loud lament through all the main

16122,ARGUMENT.,And fatted sheep and sable oxen slay;

16124,ARGUMENT.,"And, like a god adorn’d, thy earthly part expires."
16125,ARGUMENT.,Unnumber’d warriors round the burning pile

16140,ARGUMENT.,Thy destined tomb and cast a mighty mound;
16141,ARGUMENT.,"High on the shore the growing hill we raise,"
16142,ARGUMENT.,That wide the extended Hellespont surveys;
16143,ARGUMENT.,"Where all, from age to age, who pass the coast,"
16144,ARGUMENT.,"May point Achilles’ tomb, and hail the mighty ghost."
16145,ARGUMENT.,Thetis herself to all our peers proclaims
16146,ARGUMENT.,Heroic prizes and exequial games;
16147,ARGUMENT.,The gods assented; and around thee lay
16148,ARGUMENT.,Rich spoils and gifts that blazed against the day.
16149,ARGUMENT.,Oft have I seen with solemn funeral games
16150,ARGUMENT.,Heroes and kings committed to the flames;
16151,ARGUMENT.,"But strength of youth, or valour of the brave,"
16152,ARGUMENT.,With nobler contest ne’er renown’d a grave.
16153,ARGUMENT.,"Such were the games by azure Thetis given,"
16154,ARGUMENT.,"And such thy honours, O beloved of Heaven!"
16155,ARGUMENT.,"Dear to mankind thy fame survives, nor fades"
16156,ARGUMENT.,Its bloom eternal in the Stygian shades.
16157,ARGUMENT.,"But what to me avail my honours gone,"
16158,ARGUMENT.,"Successful toils, and battles bravely won?"
16159,ARGUMENT.,"Doom’d by stern Jove at home to end my life,"
16160,ARGUMENT.,"By cursed Ægysthus, and a faithless wife!”"

16162,ARGUMENT.,Led the sad numbers by Ulysses slain.
16163,ARGUMENT.,"On each majestic form they cast a view,"
16164,ARGUMENT.,"And timorous pass’d, and awfully withdrew."
16165,ARGUMENT.,"But Agamemnon, through the gloomy shade,"
16166,ARGUMENT.,His ancient host Amphimedon survey’d:
16167,ARGUMENT.,“Son of Melanthius! (he began) O say!
16168,ARGUMENT.,"What cause compell’d so many, and so gay,"
16169,ARGUMENT.,"To tread the downward, melancholy way?"
16170,ARGUMENT.,"Say, could one city yield a troop so fair?"
16171,ARGUMENT.,Were all these partners of one native air?
16172,ARGUMENT.,Or did the rage of stormy Neptune sweep
16173,ARGUMENT.,"Your lives at once, and whelm beneath the deep?"
16174,ARGUMENT.,"Did nightly thieves, or pirates’ cruel bands,"
16175,ARGUMENT.,Drench with your blood your pillaged country’s sands?
16176,ARGUMENT.,"Or well-defending some beleaguer’d wall,"
16177,ARGUMENT.,"Say,—for the public did ye greatly fall?"
16178,ARGUMENT.,Inform thy guest: for such I was of yore
16179,ARGUMENT.,When our triumphant navies touch’d your shore;
16180,ARGUMENT.,"Forced a long month the wintry seas to bear,"
16181,ARGUMENT.,To move the great Ulysses to the war.”
16182,ARGUMENT.,
16183,ARGUMENT.,“O king of men! I faithful shall relate

16187,ARGUMENT.,"Her coy reserve, and prudence mix’d with pride,"
16188,ARGUMENT.,"Our common suit nor granted, nor denied;"
16189,ARGUMENT.,But close with inward hate our deaths design’d;
16190,ARGUMENT.,Versed in all arts of wily womankind.
16191,ARGUMENT.,"Her hand, laborious, in delusion spread"
16192,ARGUMENT.,"A spacious loom, and mix’d the various thread."
16193,ARGUMENT.,"‘Ye peers (she cried) who press to gain my heart,"
16194,ARGUMENT.,"Where dead Ulysses claims no more a part,"
16195,ARGUMENT.,"Yet a short space your rival suit suspend,"
16196,ARGUMENT.,Till this funereal web my labours end:
16197,ARGUMENT.,"Cease, till to good Laertes I bequeath"
16198,ARGUMENT.,"A task of grief, his ornaments of death:"
16199,ARGUMENT.,"Lest when the Fates his royal ashes claim,"

16202,ARGUMENT.,Want the last duties of a daughter’s hand.’
16203,ARGUMENT.,
16204,ARGUMENT.,"“The fiction pleased, our generous train complies,"
16205,ARGUMENT.,Nor fraud mistrusts in virtue’s fair disguise.
16206,ARGUMENT.,"The work she plied, but studious of delay,"
16207,ARGUMENT.,Each following night reversed the toils of day.
16208,ARGUMENT.,"Unheard, unseen, three years her arts prevail;"
16209,ARGUMENT.,"The fourth, her maid reveal’d the amazing tale,"
16210,ARGUMENT.,"And show’d as unperceived we took our stand,"
16211,ARGUMENT.,The backward labours of her faithless hand.
16212,ARGUMENT.,Forced she completes it; and before us lay
16213,ARGUMENT.,"The mingled web, whose gold and silver ray"
16214,ARGUMENT.,Display’d the radiance of the night and day.
16215,ARGUMENT.,
16216,ARGUMENT.,"“Just as she finished her illustrious toil,"
16217,ARGUMENT.,Ill fortune led Ulysses to our isle.
16218,ARGUMENT.,"Far in a lonely nook, beside the sea,"
16219,ARGUMENT.,At an old swineherd’s rural lodge he lay:
16220,ARGUMENT.,"Thither his son from sandy Pyle repairs,"
16221,ARGUMENT.,"And speedy lands, and secretly confers."
16222,ARGUMENT.,"They plan our future ruin, and resort"
16223,ARGUMENT.,Confederate to the city and the court.
16224,ARGUMENT.,"First came the son; the father next succeeds,"
16225,ARGUMENT.,"Clad like a beggar, whom Eumaeus leads;"
16226,ARGUMENT.,"Propp’d on a staff, deform’d with age and care,"
16227,ARGUMENT.,And hung with rags that flutter’d in the air.
16228,ARGUMENT.,Who could Ulysses in that form behold?
16229,ARGUMENT.,"Scorn’d by the young, forgotten by the old,"
16230,ARGUMENT.,"Ill-used by all! to every wrong resigned,"
16231,ARGUMENT.,Patient he suffered with a constant mind.
16232,ARGUMENT.,"But when, arising in his wrath to obey"
16233,ARGUMENT.,"The will of Jove, he gave the vengeance way:"
16234,ARGUMENT.,The scattered arms that hung around the dome
16235,ARGUMENT.,Careful he treasured in a private room;
16236,ARGUMENT.,Then to her suitors bade his queen propose
16237,ARGUMENT.,"The archer’s strife, the source of future woes,"
16238,ARGUMENT.,And omen of our death! In vain we drew
16239,ARGUMENT.,"The twanging string, and tried the stubborn yew:"
16240,ARGUMENT.,To none it yields but great Ulysses’ hands;
16241,ARGUMENT.,In vain we threat; Telemachus commands:
16242,ARGUMENT.,"The bow he snatch’d, and in an instant bent;"
16243,ARGUMENT.,Through every ring the victor arrow went.
16244,ARGUMENT.,Fierce on the threshold then in arms he stood;
16245,ARGUMENT.,"Poured forth the darts that thirsted for our blood,"
16246,ARGUMENT.,"And frown’d before us, dreadful as a god!"
16247,ARGUMENT.,"First bleeds Antinous: thick the shafts resound,"
16248,ARGUMENT.,And heaps on heaps the wretches strew the ground;
16249,ARGUMENT.,"This way, and that, we turn, we fly, we fall;"
16250,ARGUMENT.,"Some god assisted, and unmann’d us all;"
16251,ARGUMENT.,Ignoble cries precede the dying groans;
16252,ARGUMENT.,And battered brains and blood besmear the stones.
16253,ARGUMENT.,
16254,ARGUMENT.,"“Thus, great Atrides, thus Ulysses drove"
16255,ARGUMENT.,The shades thou seest from yon fair realms above;
16256,ARGUMENT.,"Our mangled bodies now deformed with gore,"
16257,ARGUMENT.,"Cold and neglected, spread the marble floor."
16258,ARGUMENT.,"No friend to bathe our wounds, or tears to shed"
16259,ARGUMENT.,O’er the pale corse! the honours of the dead.”
16260,ARGUMENT.,
16261,ARGUMENT.,“Oh bless’d Ulysses! (thus the king express’d
16262,ARGUMENT.,His sudden rapture) in thy consort bless’d!
16263,ARGUMENT.,Not more thy wisdom than her virtue shined;
16264,ARGUMENT.,Not more thy patience than her constant mind.
16265,ARGUMENT.,"Icarius’ daughter, glory of the past,"
16266,ARGUMENT.,"And model to the future age, shall last:"
16267,ARGUMENT.,"The gods, to honour her fair fame, shall rise"
16268,ARGUMENT.,(Their great reward) a poet in her praise.
16269,ARGUMENT.,"Not such, O Tyndarus! thy daughter’s deed,"

16272,ARGUMENT.,"Example dread, and theme of tragic song!"
16273,ARGUMENT.,"The general sex shall suffer in her shame,"
16274,ARGUMENT.,And e’en the best that bears a woman’s name.”
16275,ARGUMENT.,
16276,ARGUMENT.,Thus in the regions of eternal shade
16277,ARGUMENT.,Conferr’d the mournful phantoms of the dead;
16278,ARGUMENT.,"While from the town, Ulysses and his band"
16279,ARGUMENT.,Pass’d to Laertes’ cultivated land.
16280,ARGUMENT.,"The ground himself had purchased with his pain,"
16281,ARGUMENT.,"And labour made the rugged soil a plain,"
16282,ARGUMENT.,"There stood his mansion of the rural sort,"
16283,ARGUMENT.,With useful buildings round the lowly court;
16284,ARGUMENT.,Where the few servants that divide his care
16285,ARGUMENT.,"Took their laborious rest, and homely fare;"
16286,ARGUMENT.,"And one Sicilian matron, old and sage,"
16287,ARGUMENT.,With constant duty tends his drooping age.
16288,ARGUMENT.,
16289,ARGUMENT.,"Here now arriving, to his rustic band"
16290,ARGUMENT.,"And martial son, Ulysses gave command:"
16291,ARGUMENT.,"“Enter the house, and of the bristly swine"
16292,ARGUMENT.,Select the largest to the powers divine.
16293,ARGUMENT.,"Alone, and unattended, let me try"
16294,ARGUMENT.,If yet I share the old man’s memory:
16295,ARGUMENT.,If those dim eyes can yet Ulysses know
16296,ARGUMENT.,"(Their light and dearest object long ago),"
16297,ARGUMENT.,"Now changed with time, with absence and with woe.”"
16298,ARGUMENT.,Then to his train he gives his spear and shield;
16299,ARGUMENT.,"The house they enter; and he seeks the field,"
16300,ARGUMENT.,"Through rows of shade, with various fruitage crown’d,"
16301,ARGUMENT.,And labour’d scenes of richest verdure round.
16302,ARGUMENT.,"Nor aged Dolius; nor his sons, were there,"
16303,ARGUMENT.,"Nor servants, absent on another care;"
16304,ARGUMENT.,"To search the woods for sets of flowery thorn,"
16305,ARGUMENT.,Their orchard bounds to strengthen and adorn.
16306,ARGUMENT.,
16307,ARGUMENT.,But all alone the hoary king he found;
16308,ARGUMENT.,"His habit course, but warmly wrapp’d around;"
16309,ARGUMENT.,"His head, that bow’d with many a pensive care,"
16310,ARGUMENT.,Fenced with a double cap of goatskin hair:
16311,ARGUMENT.,"His buskins old, in former service torn,"
16312,ARGUMENT.,But swell repair’d; and gloves against the thorn.
16313,ARGUMENT.,"In this array the kingly gardener stood,"
16314,ARGUMENT.,"And clear’d a plant, encumber’d with its wood."
16315,ARGUMENT.,
16316,ARGUMENT.,"Beneath a neighbouring tree, the chief divine"
16317,ARGUMENT.,"Gazed o’er his sire, retracing every line,"
16318,ARGUMENT.,"The ruins of himself, now worn away"
16319,ARGUMENT.,"With age, yet still majestic in decay!"
16320,ARGUMENT.,Sudden his eyes released their watery store;
16321,ARGUMENT.,The much-enduring man could bear no more.
16322,ARGUMENT.,"Doubtful he stood, if instant to embrace"
16323,ARGUMENT.,"His aged limbs, to kiss his reverend face,"
16324,ARGUMENT.,"With eager transport to disclose the whole,"
16325,ARGUMENT.,And pour at once the torrent of his soul.—
16326,ARGUMENT.,Not so: his judgment takes the winding way
16327,ARGUMENT.,"Of question distant, and of soft essay;"
16328,ARGUMENT.,More gentle methods on weak age employs:
16329,ARGUMENT.,And moves the sorrows to enhance the joys.
16330,ARGUMENT.,"Then, to his sire with beating heart he moves,"
16331,ARGUMENT.,And with a tender pleasantry reproves;
16332,ARGUMENT.,"Who digging round the plant still hangs his bead,"
16333,ARGUMENT.,"Nor aught remits the work, while thus he said:"
16334,ARGUMENT.,
16335,ARGUMENT.,"“Great is thy skill, O father! great thy toil,"
16336,ARGUMENT.,"Thy careful hand is stamp’d on all the soil,"
16337,ARGUMENT.,"Thy squadron’d vineyards well thy art declare,"
16338,ARGUMENT.,"The olive green, blue fig, and pendent pear;"
16339,ARGUMENT.,And not one empty spot escapes thy care.
16340,ARGUMENT.,"On every plant and tree thy cares are shown,"
16341,ARGUMENT.,"Nothing neglected, but thyself alone."
16342,ARGUMENT.,"Forgive me, father, if this fault I blame;"
16343,ARGUMENT.,"Age so advanced, may some indulgence claim."
16344,ARGUMENT.,"Not for thy sloth, I deem thy lord unkind:"
16345,ARGUMENT.,Nor speaks thy form a mean or servile mind;
16346,ARGUMENT.,"I read a monarch in that princely air,"
16347,ARGUMENT.,"The same thy aspect, if the same thy care;"
16348,ARGUMENT.,"Soft sleep, fair garments, and the joys of wine,"
16349,ARGUMENT.,"These are the rights of age, and should be thine."
16350,ARGUMENT.,"Who then thy master, say? and whose the land"
16351,ARGUMENT.,So dress’d and managed by thy skilful hand?
16352,ARGUMENT.,"But chief, oh tell me! (what I question most)"
16353,ARGUMENT.,Is this the far-famed Ithacensian coast?
16354,ARGUMENT.,For so reported the first man I view’d
16355,ARGUMENT.,"(Some surly islander, of manners rude),"
16356,ARGUMENT.,Nor farther conference vouchsafed to stay;
16357,ARGUMENT.,"Heedless he whistled, and pursued his way."
16358,ARGUMENT.,"But thou whom years have taught to understand,"
16359,ARGUMENT.,"Humanely hear, and answer my demand:"
16360,ARGUMENT.,"A friend I seek, a wise one and a brave:"
16361,ARGUMENT.,"Say, lives he yet, or moulders in the grave?"
16362,ARGUMENT.,Time was (my fortunes then were at the best)
16363,ARGUMENT.,When at my house I lodged this foreign guest;
16364,ARGUMENT.,"He said, from Ithaca’s fair isle he came,"
16365,ARGUMENT.,And old Laertes was his father’s name.
16366,ARGUMENT.,"To him, whatever to a guest is owed"
16367,ARGUMENT.,"I paid, and hospitable gifts bestow’d:"
16368,ARGUMENT.,"To him seven talents of pure ore I told,"
16369,ARGUMENT.,"Twelve cloaks, twelve vests, twelve tunics stiff with gold:"
16370,ARGUMENT.,"A bowl, that rich with polish’d silver flames,"
16371,ARGUMENT.,"And skill’d in female works, four lovely dames.”"
16372,ARGUMENT.,
16373,ARGUMENT.,"At this the father, with a father’s fears"
16374,ARGUMENT.,(His venerable eyes bedimm’d with tears):
16375,ARGUMENT.,"“This is the land; but ah! thy gifts are lost,"
16376,ARGUMENT.,"For godless men, and rude possess the coast:"
16377,ARGUMENT.,Sunk is the glory of this once-famed shore!
16378,ARGUMENT.,"Thy ancient friend, O stranger, is no more!"
16379,ARGUMENT.,Full recompense thy bounty else had borne:
16380,ARGUMENT.,For every good man yields a just return:
16381,ARGUMENT.,So civil rights demand; and who begins
16382,ARGUMENT.,"The track of friendship, not pursuing, sins."
16383,ARGUMENT.,"But tell me, stranger, be the truth confess’d,"
16384,ARGUMENT.,What years have circled since thou saw’st that guest?
16385,ARGUMENT.,"That hapless guest, alas! for ever gone!"
16386,ARGUMENT.,Wretch that he was! and that I am! my son!
16387,ARGUMENT.,"If ever man to misery was born,"
16388,ARGUMENT.,"’Twas his to suffer, and ’tis mine to mourn!"
16389,ARGUMENT.,"Far from his friends, and from his native reign,"
16390,ARGUMENT.,He lies a prey to monsters of the main;
16391,ARGUMENT.,"Or savage beasts his mangled relics tear,"
16392,ARGUMENT.,Or screaming vultures scatter through the air:
16393,ARGUMENT.,Nor could his mother funeral unguents shed;
16394,ARGUMENT.,Nor wail’d his father o’er the untimely dead:
16395,ARGUMENT.,"Nor his sad consort, on the mournful bier,"
16396,ARGUMENT.,"Seal’d his cold eyes, or dropp’d a tender tear!"
16397,ARGUMENT.,
16398,ARGUMENT.,"“But, tell me who thou art? and what thy race?"
16399,ARGUMENT.,"Thy town, thy parents, and thy native place?"
16400,ARGUMENT.,"Or, if a merchant in pursuit of gain,"
16401,ARGUMENT.,What port received thy vessel from the main?
16402,ARGUMENT.,"Or comest thou single, or attend thy train?”"
16403,ARGUMENT.,
16404,ARGUMENT.,"Then thus the son: “From Alybas I came,"
16405,ARGUMENT.,My palace there; Eperitus my name
16406,ARGUMENT.,"Not vulgar born: from Aphidas, the king"
16407,ARGUMENT.,"Of Polyphemon’s royal line, I spring."
16408,ARGUMENT.,Some adverse demon from Sicania bore
16409,ARGUMENT.,"Our wandering course, and drove us on your shore;"
16410,ARGUMENT.,"Far from the town, an unfrequented bay"
16411,ARGUMENT.,Relieved our wearied vessel from the sea.
16412,ARGUMENT.,Five years have circled since these eyes pursued
16413,ARGUMENT.,Ulysses parting through the sable flood:
16414,ARGUMENT.,"Prosperous he sail’d, with dexter auguries,"
16415,ARGUMENT.,And all the wing’d good omens of the skies.
16416,ARGUMENT.,"Well hoped we then to meet on this fair shore,"
16417,ARGUMENT.,"Whom Heaven, alas! decreed to meet no more.”"
16418,ARGUMENT.,
16419,ARGUMENT.,Quick through the father’s heart these accents ran;
16420,ARGUMENT.,"Grief seized at once, and wrapp’d up all the man:"
16421,ARGUMENT.,"Deep from his soul he sigh’d, and sorrowing spread"
16422,ARGUMENT.,A cloud of ashes on his hoary head.
16423,ARGUMENT.,Trembling with agonies of strong delight
16424,ARGUMENT.,"Stood the great son, heart-wounded with the sight:"
16425,ARGUMENT.,"He ran, he seized him with a strict embrace,"
16426,ARGUMENT.,With thousand kisses wander’d o’er his face:
16427,ARGUMENT.,"“I, I am he; O father, rise! behold"
16428,ARGUMENT.,"Thy son, with twenty winters now grown old;"
16429,ARGUMENT.,"Thy son, so long desired, so long detain’d,"
16430,ARGUMENT.,"Restored, and breathing in his native land:"
16431,ARGUMENT.,"These floods of sorrow, O my sire, restrain!"
16432,ARGUMENT.,"The vengeance is complete; the suitor train,"
16433,ARGUMENT.,"Stretch’d in our palace, by these hands lie slain.”"
16434,ARGUMENT.,
16435,ARGUMENT.,"Amazed, Laertes: “Give some certain sign"
16436,ARGUMENT.,(If such thou art) to manifest thee mine.”
16437,ARGUMENT.,
16438,ARGUMENT.,"“Lo here the wound (he cries) received of yore,"
16439,ARGUMENT.,"The scar indented by the tusky boar,"
16440,ARGUMENT.,"When, by thyself, and by Anticlea sent,"
16441,ARGUMENT.,To old Autolycus’ realms I went.
16442,ARGUMENT.,Yet by another sign thy offspring know;
16443,ARGUMENT.,"The several trees you gave me long ago,"
16444,ARGUMENT.,"While yet a child, these fields I loved to trace,"
16445,ARGUMENT.,And trod thy footsteps with unequal pace;
16446,ARGUMENT.,"To every plant in order as we came,"
16447,ARGUMENT.,"Well-pleased, you told its nature and its name,"
16448,ARGUMENT.,"Whate’er my childish fancy ask’d, bestow’d:"
16449,ARGUMENT.,"Twelve pear-trees, bowing with their pendent load,"
16450,ARGUMENT.,"And ten, that red with blushing apples glow’d;"
16451,ARGUMENT.,Full fifty purple figs; and many a row
16452,ARGUMENT.,"Of various vines that then began to blow,"
16453,ARGUMENT.,A future vintage! when the Hours produce
16454,ARGUMENT.,"Their latent buds, and Sol exalts the juice.”"
16455,ARGUMENT.,
16456,ARGUMENT.,"Smit with the signs which all his doubts explain,"
16457,ARGUMENT.,His heart within him melts; his knees sustain
16458,ARGUMENT.,Their feeble weight no more: his arms alone
16459,ARGUMENT.,"Support him, round the loved Ulysses thrown;"
16460,ARGUMENT.,"He faints, he sinks, with mighty joys oppress’d:"
16461,ARGUMENT.,Ulysses clasps him to his eager breast.
16462,ARGUMENT.,"Soon as returning life regains its seat,"
16463,ARGUMENT.,"And his breath lengthens, and his pulses beat:"
16464,ARGUMENT.,"“Yes, I believe (he cries) almighty Jove!"
16465,ARGUMENT.,"Heaven rules us yet, and gods there are above."
16466,ARGUMENT.,’Tis so—the suitors for their wrongs have paid—
16467,ARGUMENT.,"But what shall guard us, if the town invade?"
16468,ARGUMENT.,"If, while the news through every city flies,"
16469,ARGUMENT.,All Ithaca and Cephalenia rise?”
16470,ARGUMENT.,To this Ulysses: “As the gods shall please
16471,ARGUMENT.,Be all the rest: and set thy soul at ease.
16472,ARGUMENT.,"Haste to the cottage by this orchard’s side,"
16473,ARGUMENT.,And take the banquet which our cares provide;
16474,ARGUMENT.,"There wait thy faithful band of rural friends,"
16475,ARGUMENT.,And there the young Telemachus attends.”
16476,ARGUMENT.,
16477,ARGUMENT.,"Thus, having said, they traced the garden o’er"
16478,ARGUMENT.,And stooping entered at the lowly door.
16479,ARGUMENT.,The swains and young Telemachus they found.
16480,ARGUMENT.,The victim portion’d and the goblet crown’d.
16481,ARGUMENT.,"The hoary king, his old Sicilian maid"
16482,ARGUMENT.,"Perfum’d and wash’d, and gorgeously arrayed."
16483,ARGUMENT.,Pallas attending gives his frame to shine
16484,ARGUMENT.,"With awful port, and majesty divine;"
16485,ARGUMENT.,"His gazing son admires the godlike grace,"
16486,ARGUMENT.,And air celestial dawning o’er his face.
16487,ARGUMENT.,“What god (he cried) my father’s form improves!
16488,ARGUMENT.,How high he treads and how enlarged he moves!”
16489,ARGUMENT.,
16490,ARGUMENT.,"“Oh! would to all the deathless powers on high,"
16491,ARGUMENT.,"Pallas and Jove, and him who gilds the sky!"
16492,ARGUMENT.,(Replied the king elated with his praise)
16493,ARGUMENT.,"My strength were still, as once in better days:"
16494,ARGUMENT.,When the bold Cephalens the leaguer form’d.
16495,ARGUMENT.,And proud Nericus trembled as I storm’d.
16496,ARGUMENT.,"Such were I now, not absent from your deed"
16497,ARGUMENT.,"When the last sun beheld the suitors bleed,"
16498,ARGUMENT.,"This arm had aided yours, this hand bestrown"
16499,ARGUMENT.,"Our shores with death, and push’d the slaughter on;"
16500,ARGUMENT.,Nor had the sire been separate from the son.”
16501,ARGUMENT.,
16502,ARGUMENT.,They communed thus; while homeward bent their way
16503,ARGUMENT.,"The swains, fatigued with labours of the day:"
16504,ARGUMENT.,"Dolius, the first, the venerable man;"
16505,ARGUMENT.,"And next his sons, a long succeeding train."
16506,ARGUMENT.,"For due refection to the bower they came,"
16507,ARGUMENT.,"Call’d by the careful old Sicilian dame,"
16508,ARGUMENT.,"Who nursed the children, and now tends the sire,"
16509,ARGUMENT.,"They see their lord, they gaze, and they admire."
16510,ARGUMENT.,"On chairs and beds in order seated round,"
16511,ARGUMENT.,"They share the gladsome board; the roofs resound,"
16512,ARGUMENT.,While thus Ulysses to his ancient friend:
16513,ARGUMENT.,"“Forbear your wonder, and the feast attend:"
16514,ARGUMENT.,The rites have waited long.” The chief commands
16515,ARGUMENT.,"Their love in vain; old Dolius spreads his hands,"
16516,ARGUMENT.,"Springs to his master with a warm embrace,"
16517,ARGUMENT.,And fastens kisses on his hands and face;
16518,ARGUMENT.,"Then thus broke out: “O long, O daily mourn’d!"
16519,ARGUMENT.,"Beyond our hopes, and to our wish return’d!"
16520,ARGUMENT.,Conducted sure by Heaven! for Heaven alone
16521,ARGUMENT.,Could work this wonder: welcome to thy own!
16522,ARGUMENT.,And joys and happiness attend thy throne!
16523,ARGUMENT.,"Who knows thy bless’d, thy wish’d return? oh say,"
16524,ARGUMENT.,To the chaste queen shall we the news convey?
16525,ARGUMENT.,"Or hears she, and with blessings loads the day?”"
16526,ARGUMENT.,
16527,ARGUMENT.,"“Dismiss that care, for to the royal bride"
16528,ARGUMENT.,"Already is it known” (the king replied,"
16529,ARGUMENT.,And straight resumed his seat); while round him bows
16530,ARGUMENT.,"Each faithful youth, and breathes out ardent vows:"
16531,ARGUMENT.,"Then all beneath their father take their place,"
16532,ARGUMENT.,"Rank’d by their ages, and the banquet grace."
16533,ARGUMENT.,
16534,ARGUMENT.,Now flying Fame the swift report had spread
16535,ARGUMENT.,"Through all the city, of the suitors dead,"
16536,ARGUMENT.,"In throngs they rise, and to the palace crowd;"
16537,ARGUMENT.,Their sighs were many and the tumult loud.
16538,ARGUMENT.,Weeping they bear the mangled heaps of slain;
16539,ARGUMENT.,"Inhume the natives in their native plain,"
16540,ARGUMENT.,The rest in ships are wafted o’er the main.
16541,ARGUMENT.,"Then sad in council all the seniors sate,"
16542,ARGUMENT.,"Frequent and full, assembled to debate:"
16543,ARGUMENT.,"Amid the circle first Eupithes rose,"
16544,ARGUMENT.,"Big was his eye with tears, his heart with woes:"
16545,ARGUMENT.,"The bold Antinous was his age’s pride,"
16546,ARGUMENT.,The first who by Ulysses’ arrow died.
16547,ARGUMENT.,"Down his wan cheek the trickling torrent ran,"
16548,ARGUMENT.,As mixing words with sighs he thus began:
16549,ARGUMENT.,
16550,ARGUMENT.,"“Great deeds, O friends! this wondrous man has wrought,"
16551,ARGUMENT.,And mighty blessings to his country brought!
16552,ARGUMENT.,"With ships he parted, and a numerous train,"
16553,ARGUMENT.,"Those, and their ships, he buried in the main."
16554,ARGUMENT.,"Now he returns, and first essays his hand"
16555,ARGUMENT.,In the best blood of all his native land.
16556,ARGUMENT.,"Haste, then, and ere to neighbouring Pyle he flies,"
16557,ARGUMENT.,"Or sacred Elis, to procure supplies;"
16558,ARGUMENT.,"Arise (or ye for ever fall), arise!"
16559,ARGUMENT.,"Shame to this age, and all that shall succeed!"
16560,ARGUMENT.,If unrevenged your sons and brothers bleed.
16561,ARGUMENT.,"Prove that we live, by vengeance on his head,"
16562,ARGUMENT.,Or sink at once forgotten with the dead.”
16563,ARGUMENT.,"Here ceased he, but indignant tears let fall"
16564,ARGUMENT.,Spoke when he ceased: dumb sorrow touch’d them all.
16565,ARGUMENT.,When from the palace to the wondering throng
16566,ARGUMENT.,"Sage Medon came, and Phemius came along"
16567,ARGUMENT.,(Restless and early sleep’s soft bands they broke);
16568,ARGUMENT.,And Medon first the assembled chiefs bespoke;
16569,ARGUMENT.,
16570,ARGUMENT.,"“Hear me, ye peers and elders of the land,"
16571,ARGUMENT.,Who deem this act the work of mortal hand;
16572,ARGUMENT.,"As o’er the heaps of death Ulysses strode,"
16573,ARGUMENT.,"These eyes, these eyes beheld a present god,"
16574,ARGUMENT.,"Who now before him, now beside him stood,"
16575,ARGUMENT.,"Fought as he fought, and mark’d his way with blood:"
16576,ARGUMENT.,In vain old Mentor’s form the god belied;
16577,ARGUMENT.,"’Twas Heaven that struck, and Heaven was on his side.”"
16578,ARGUMENT.,
16579,ARGUMENT.,"A sudden horror all the assembly shook,"
16580,ARGUMENT.,"When slowly rising, Halitherses spoke"
16581,ARGUMENT.,"(Reverend and wise, whose comprehensive view"
16582,ARGUMENT.,At once the present and the future knew):
16583,ARGUMENT.,"“Me too, ye fathers, hear! from you proceed"
16584,ARGUMENT.,The ills ye mourn; your own the guilty deed.
16585,ARGUMENT.,"Ye gave your sons, your lawless sons, the rein"
16586,ARGUMENT.,(Oft warn’d by Mentor and myself in vain);
16587,ARGUMENT.,"An absent hero’s bed they sought to soil,"
16588,ARGUMENT.,An absent hero’s wealth they made their spoil;
16589,ARGUMENT.,"Immoderate riot, and intemperate lust!"
16590,ARGUMENT.,"The offence was great, the punishment was just."
16591,ARGUMENT.,"Weigh then my counsels in an equal scale,"
16592,ARGUMENT.,Nor rush to ruin. Justice will prevail.”
16593,ARGUMENT.,
16594,ARGUMENT.,His moderate words some better minds persuade:
16595,ARGUMENT.,"They part, and join him: but the number stay’d."
16596,ARGUMENT.,"They storm, they shout, with hasty frenzy fired,"
16597,ARGUMENT.,And second all Eupithes’ rage inspired.
16598,ARGUMENT.,They case their limbs in brass; to arms they run;
16599,ARGUMENT.,The broad effulgence blazes in the sun.
16600,ARGUMENT.,"Before the city, and in ample plain,"
16601,ARGUMENT.,They meet: Eupithes heads the frantic train.
16602,ARGUMENT.,"Fierce for his son, he breathes his threats in air;"
16603,ARGUMENT.,"Fate bears them not, and Death attends him there."
16604,ARGUMENT.,
16605,ARGUMENT.,"This pass’d on earth, while in the realms above"
16606,ARGUMENT.,Minerva thus to cloud-compelling Jove!
16607,ARGUMENT.,“May I presume to search thy secret soul?
16608,ARGUMENT.,"O Power Supreme, O Ruler of the whole!"
16609,ARGUMENT.,"Say, hast thou doom’d to this divided state"
16610,ARGUMENT.,Or peaceful amity or stern debate?
16611,ARGUMENT.,"Declare thy purpose, for thy will is fate.”"
16612,ARGUMENT.,
16613,ARGUMENT.,“Is not thy thought my own? (the god replies
16614,ARGUMENT.,Who rolls the thunder o’er the vaulted skies;)
16615,ARGUMENT.,Hath not long since thy knowing soul decreed
16616,ARGUMENT.,The chief’s return should make the guilty bleed.
16617,ARGUMENT.,"’Tis done, and at thy will the Fates succeed."
16618,ARGUMENT.,Yet hear the issue: Since Ulysses’ hand
16619,ARGUMENT.,"Has slain the suitors, Heaven shall bless the land."
16620,ARGUMENT.,None now the kindred of the unjust shall own;
16621,ARGUMENT.,Forgot the slaughter’d brother and the son:
16622,ARGUMENT.,"Each future day increase of wealth shall bring,"
16623,ARGUMENT.,And o’er the past Oblivion stretch her wing.
16624,ARGUMENT.,"Long shall Ulysses in his empire rest,"
16625,ARGUMENT.,"His people blessing, by his people bless’d."
16626,ARGUMENT.,"Let all be peace.”—He said, and gave the nod"
16627,ARGUMENT.,That binds the Fates; the sanction of the god
16628,ARGUMENT.,"And prompt to execute the eternal will,"
16629,ARGUMENT.,Descended Pallas from the Olympian hill.
16630,ARGUMENT.,
16631,ARGUMENT.,Now sat Ulysses at the rural feast
16632,ARGUMENT.,The rage of hunger and of thirst repress’d:
16633,ARGUMENT.,To watch the foe a trusty spy he sent:
16634,ARGUMENT.,"A son of Dolius on the message went,"
16635,ARGUMENT.,"Stood in the way, and at a glance beheld"
16636,ARGUMENT.,"The foe approach, embattled on the field."
16637,ARGUMENT.,"With backward step he hastens to the bower,"
16638,ARGUMENT.,And tells the news. They arm with all their power.
16639,ARGUMENT.,"Four friends alone Ulysses’ cause embrace,"
16640,ARGUMENT.,And six were all the sons of Dolius’ race:
16641,ARGUMENT.,Old Dolius too his rusted arms put on;
16642,ARGUMENT.,"And, still more old, in arms Laertes shone."
16643,ARGUMENT.,"Trembling with warmth, the hoary heroes stand,"
16644,ARGUMENT.,And brazen panoply invests the band.
16645,ARGUMENT.,The opening gates at once their war display:
16646,ARGUMENT.,Fierce they rush forth: Ulysses leads the way.
16647,ARGUMENT.,"That moment joins them with celestial aid,"
16648,ARGUMENT.,"In Mentor’s form, the Jove-descended maid:"
16649,ARGUMENT.,The suffering hero felt his patient breast
16650,ARGUMENT.,"Swell with new joy, and thus his son address’d:"
16651,ARGUMENT.,
16652,ARGUMENT.,"“Behold, Telemachus! (nor fear the sight,)"
16653,ARGUMENT.,"The brave embattled, the grim front of fight!"
16654,ARGUMENT.,The valiant with the valiant must contend.
16655,ARGUMENT.,Shame not the line whence glorious you descend.
16656,ARGUMENT.,Wide o’er the world their martial fame was spread;
16657,ARGUMENT.,"Regard thyself, the living and the dead.”"
16658,ARGUMENT.,
16659,ARGUMENT.,"“Thy eyes, great father! on this battle cast,"
16660,ARGUMENT.,Shall learn from me Penelope was chaste.”
16661,ARGUMENT.,
16662,ARGUMENT.,So spoke Telemachus: the gallant boy
16663,ARGUMENT.,Good old Laertes heard with panting joy.
16664,ARGUMENT.,"“And bless’d! thrice bless’d this happy day! (he cries,)"
16665,ARGUMENT.,"The day that shows me, ere I close my eyes,"
16666,ARGUMENT.,A son and grandson of the Arcesian name
16667,ARGUMENT.,"Strive for fair virtue, and contest for fame!”"
16668,ARGUMENT.,
16669,ARGUMENT.,Then thus Minerva in Laertes’ ear:
16670,ARGUMENT.,"“Son of Arcesius, reverend warrior, hear!"
16671,ARGUMENT.,"Jove and Jove’s daughter first implore in prayer,"
16672,ARGUMENT.,"Then, whirling high, discharge thy lance in air.”"
16673,ARGUMENT.,"She said, infusing courage with the word."
16674,ARGUMENT.,"Jove and Jove’s daughter then the chief implored,"
16675,ARGUMENT.,"And, whirling high, dismiss’d the lance in air."
16676,ARGUMENT.,Full at Eupithes drove the deathful spear:
16677,ARGUMENT.,The brass-cheek’d helmet opens to the wound;
16678,ARGUMENT.,"He falls, earth thunders, and his arms resound."
16679,ARGUMENT.,Before the father and the conquering son
16680,ARGUMENT.,"Heaps rush on heaps, they fight, they drop, they run"
16681,ARGUMENT.,"Now by the sword, and now the javelin, fall"
16682,ARGUMENT.,"The rebel race, and death had swallow’d all;"
16683,ARGUMENT.,But from on high the blue-eyed virgin cried;
16684,ARGUMENT.,Her awful voice detain’d the headlong tide:
16685,ARGUMENT.,"“Forbear, ye nations, your mad hands forbear"
16686,ARGUMENT.,From mutual slaughter; Peace descends to spare.”
16687,ARGUMENT.,Fear shook the nations: at the voice divine
