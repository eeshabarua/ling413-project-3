71,CANTO I,
72,CANTO I,"His glory, by whose might all things are mov'd,"
73,CANTO I,"Pierces the universe, and in one part"
74,CANTO I,"Sheds more resplendence, elsewhere less.  In heav'n,"
75,CANTO I,"That largeliest of his light partakes, was I,"
76,CANTO I,"Witness of things, which to relate again"
77,CANTO I,Surpasseth power of him who comes from thence;
78,CANTO I,"For that, so near approaching its desire"
79,CANTO I,"Our intellect is to such depth absorb'd,"
80,CANTO I,"That memory cannot follow.  Nathless all,"
81,CANTO I,That in my thoughts I of that sacred realm
82,CANTO I,"Could store, shall now be matter of my song."
83,CANTO I,
84,CANTO I,"Benign Apollo! this last labour aid,"
85,CANTO I,"And make me such a vessel of thy worth,"
86,CANTO I,As thy own laurel claims of me belov'd.
87,CANTO I,Thus far hath one of steep Parnassus' brows
88,CANTO I,Suffic'd me; henceforth there is need of both
89,CANTO I,For my remaining enterprise Do thou
90,CANTO I,"Enter into my bosom, and there breathe"
91,CANTO I,"So, as when Marsyas by thy hand was dragg'd"
92,CANTO I,Forth from his limbs unsheath'd.  O power divine!
93,CANTO I,"If thou to me of shine impart so much,"
94,CANTO I,That of that happy realm the shadow'd form
95,CANTO I,"Trac'd in my thoughts I may set forth to view,"
96,CANTO I,Thou shalt behold me of thy favour'd tree
97,CANTO I,"Come to the foot, and crown myself with leaves;"
98,CANTO I,"For to that honour thou, and my high theme"
99,CANTO I,"Will fit me.  If but seldom, mighty Sire!"
100,CANTO I,To grace his triumph gathers thence a wreath
101,CANTO I,Caesar or bard (more shame for human wills
102,CANTO I,Deprav'd) joy to the Delphic god must spring
103,CANTO I,"From the Pierian foliage, when one breast"
104,CANTO I,Is with such thirst inspir'd.  From a small spark
105,CANTO I,Great flame hath risen: after me perchance
106,CANTO I,"Others with better voice may pray, and gain"
107,CANTO I,From the Cirrhaean city answer kind.
108,CANTO I,
109,CANTO I,"Through diver passages, the world's bright lamp"
110,CANTO I,"Rises to mortals, but through that which joins"
111,CANTO I,"Four circles with the threefold cross, in best"
112,CANTO I,"Course, and in happiest constellation set"
113,CANTO I,"He comes, and to the worldly wax best gives"
114,CANTO I,"Its temper and impression.  Morning there,"
115,CANTO I,Here eve was by almost such passage made;
116,CANTO I,"And whiteness had o'erspread that hemisphere,"
117,CANTO I,Blackness the other part; when to the left
118,CANTO I,"I saw Beatrice turn'd, and on the sun"
119,CANTO I,"Gazing, as never eagle fix'd his ken."
120,CANTO I,As from the first a second beam is wont
121,CANTO I,"To issue, and reflected upwards rise,"
122,CANTO I,"E'en as a pilgrim bent on his return,"
123,CANTO I,"So of her act, that through the eyesight pass'd"
124,CANTO I,"Into my fancy, mine was form'd; and straight,"
125,CANTO I,"Beyond our mortal wont, I fix'd mine eyes"
126,CANTO I,"Upon the sun.  Much is allowed us there,"
127,CANTO I,That here exceeds our pow'r; thanks to the place
128,CANTO I,Made for the dwelling of the human kind
129,CANTO I,
130,CANTO I,"I suffer'd it not long, and yet so long"
131,CANTO I,"That I beheld it bick'ring sparks around,"
132,CANTO I,As iron that comes boiling from the fire.
133,CANTO I,And suddenly upon the day appear'd
134,CANTO I,"A day new-ris'n, as he, who hath the power,"
135,CANTO I,Had with another sun bedeck'd the sky.
136,CANTO I,
137,CANTO I,"Her eyes fast fix'd on the eternal wheels,"
138,CANTO I,Beatrice stood unmov'd; and I with ken
139,CANTO I,"Fix'd upon her, from upward gaze remov'd"
140,CANTO I,"At her aspect, such inwardly became"
141,CANTO I,"As Glaucus, when he tasted of the herb,"
142,CANTO I,That made him peer among the ocean gods;
143,CANTO I,Words may not tell of that transhuman change:
144,CANTO I,"And therefore let the example serve, though weak,"
145,CANTO I,For those whom grace hath better proof in store
146,CANTO I,
147,CANTO I,"If I were only what thou didst create,"
148,CANTO I,"Then newly, Love! by whom the heav'n is rul'd,"
149,CANTO I,"Thou know'st, who by thy light didst bear me up."
150,CANTO I,"Whenas the wheel which thou dost ever guide,"
151,CANTO I,Desired Spirit! with its harmony
152,CANTO I,"Temper'd of thee and measur'd, charm'd mine ear,"
153,CANTO I,Then seem'd to me so much of heav'n to blaze
154,CANTO I,"With the sun's flame, that rain or flood ne'er made"
155,CANTO I,"A lake so broad.  The newness of the sound,"
156,CANTO I,"And that great light, inflam'd me with desire,"
157,CANTO I,"Keener than e'er was felt, to know their cause."
158,CANTO I,
159,CANTO I,"Whence she who saw me, clearly as myself,"
160,CANTO I,"To calm my troubled mind, before I ask'd,"
161,CANTO I,"Open'd her lips, and gracious thus began:"
162,CANTO I,"""With false imagination thou thyself"
163,CANTO I,"Mak'st dull, so that thou seest not the thing,"
164,CANTO I,"Which thou hadst seen, had that been shaken off."
165,CANTO I,Thou art not on the earth as thou believ'st;
166,CANTO I,For light'ning scap'd from its own proper place
167,CANTO I,"Ne'er ran, as thou hast hither now return'd."""
168,CANTO I,
169,CANTO I,"Although divested of my first-rais'd doubt,"
170,CANTO I,"By those brief words, accompanied with smiles,"
171,CANTO I,"Yet in new doubt was I entangled more,"
172,CANTO I,"And said: ""Already satisfied, I rest"
173,CANTO I,"From admiration deep, but now admire"
174,CANTO I,"How I above those lighter bodies rise."""
175,CANTO I,
176,CANTO I,"Whence, after utt'rance of a piteous sigh,"
177,CANTO I,"She tow'rds me bent her eyes, with such a look,"
178,CANTO I,As on her frenzied child a mother casts;
179,CANTO I,"Then thus began: ""Among themselves all things"
180,CANTO I,"Have order; and from hence the form, which makes"
181,CANTO I,The universe resemble God.  In this
182,CANTO I,The higher creatures see the printed steps
183,CANTO I,"Of that eternal worth, which is the end"
184,CANTO I,"Whither the line is drawn.  All natures lean,"
185,CANTO I,"In this their order, diversely, some more,"
186,CANTO I,Some less approaching to their primal source.
187,CANTO I,Thus they to different havens are mov'd on
188,CANTO I,"Through the vast sea of being, and each one"
189,CANTO I,"With instinct giv'n, that bears it in its course;"
190,CANTO I,"This to the lunar sphere directs the fire,"
191,CANTO I,"This prompts the hearts of mortal animals,"
192,CANTO I,"This the brute earth together knits, and binds."
193,CANTO I,"Nor only creatures, void of intellect,"
194,CANTO I,"Are aim'd at by this bow; but even those,"
195,CANTO I,"That have intelligence and love, are pierc'd."
196,CANTO I,"That Providence, who so well orders all,"
197,CANTO I,"With her own light makes ever calm the heaven,"
198,CANTO I,"In which the substance, that hath greatest speed,"
199,CANTO I,"Is turn'd: and thither now, as to our seat"
200,CANTO I,"Predestin'd, we are carried by the force"
201,CANTO I,"Of that strong cord, that never looses dart,"
202,CANTO I,"But at fair aim and glad.  Yet is it true,"
203,CANTO I,That as ofttimes but ill accords the form
204,CANTO I,"To the design of art, through sluggishness"
205,CANTO I,"Of unreplying matter, so this course"
206,CANTO I,"Is sometimes quitted by the creature, who"
207,CANTO I,"Hath power, directed thus, to bend elsewhere;"
208,CANTO I,"As from a cloud the fire is seen to fall,"
209,CANTO I,"From its original impulse warp'd, to earth,"
210,CANTO I,By vicious fondness.  Thou no more admire
211,CANTO I,"Thy soaring, (if I rightly deem,) than lapse"
212,CANTO I,Of torrent downwards from a mountain's height.
213,CANTO I,"There would in thee for wonder be more cause,"
214,CANTO I,"If, free of hind'rance, thou hadst fix'd thyself"
215,CANTO I,"Below, like fire unmoving on the earth."""
216,CANTO I,
217,CANTO I,"So said, she turn'd toward the heav'n her face."
218,CANTO I,
219,CANTO I,
220,CANTO I,
221,CANTO I,
222,CANTO II,CANTO II
223,CANTO II,
224,CANTO II,"All ye, who in small bark have following sail'd,"
225,CANTO II,"Eager to listen, on the advent'rous track"
226,CANTO II,"Of my proud keel, that singing cuts its way,"
227,CANTO II,"Backward return with speed, and your own shores"
228,CANTO II,"Revisit, nor put out to open sea,"
229,CANTO II,"Where losing me, perchance ye may remain"
230,CANTO II,Bewilder'd in deep maze.  The way I pass
231,CANTO II,"Ne'er yet was run: Minerva breathes the gale,"
232,CANTO II,"Apollo guides me, and another Nine"
233,CANTO II,To my rapt sight the arctic beams reveal.
234,CANTO II,"Ye other few, who have outstretch'd the neck."
235,CANTO II,"Timely for food of angels, on which here"
236,CANTO II,"They live, yet never know satiety,"
237,CANTO II,Through the deep brine ye fearless may put out
238,CANTO II,"Your vessel, marking, well the furrow broad"
239,CANTO II,"Before you in the wave, that on both sides"
240,CANTO II,"Equal returns.  Those, glorious, who pass'd o'er"
241,CANTO II,"To Colchos, wonder'd not as ye will do,"
242,CANTO II,When they saw Jason following the plough.
243,CANTO II,
244,CANTO II,"The increate perpetual thirst, that draws"
245,CANTO II,"Toward the realm of God's own form, bore us"
246,CANTO II,Swift almost as the heaven ye behold.
247,CANTO II,
248,CANTO II,"Beatrice upward gaz'd, and I on her,"
249,CANTO II,And in such space as on the notch a dart
250,CANTO II,"Is plac'd, then loosen'd flies, I saw myself"
251,CANTO II,"Arriv'd, where wond'rous thing engag'd my sight."
252,CANTO II,"Whence she, to whom no work of mine was hid,"
253,CANTO II,"Turning to me, with aspect glad as fair,"
254,CANTO II,"Bespake me: ""Gratefully direct thy mind"
255,CANTO II,"To God, through whom to this first star we come."""
256,CANTO II,
257,CANTO II,"Me seem'd as if a cloud had cover'd us,"
258,CANTO II,"Translucent, solid, firm, and polish'd bright,"
259,CANTO II,"Like adamant, which the sun's beam had smit"
260,CANTO II,Within itself the ever-during pearl
261,CANTO II,"Receiv'd us, as the wave a ray of light"
262,CANTO II,"Receives, and rests unbroken.  If I then"
263,CANTO II,"Was of corporeal frame, and it transcend"
264,CANTO II,"Our weaker thought, how one dimension thus"
265,CANTO II,"Another could endure, which needs must be"
266,CANTO II,"If body enter body, how much more"
267,CANTO II,Must the desire inflame us to behold
268,CANTO II,"That essence, which discovers by what means"
269,CANTO II,God and our nature join'd!  There will be seen
270,CANTO II,"That which we hold through faith, not shown by proof,"
271,CANTO II,"But in itself intelligibly plain,"
272,CANTO II,E'en as the truth that man at first believes.
273,CANTO II,
274,CANTO II,"I answered: ""Lady! I with thoughts devout,"
275,CANTO II,"Such as I best can frame, give thanks to Him,"
276,CANTO II,Who hath remov'd me from the mortal world.
277,CANTO II,"But tell, I pray thee, whence the gloomy spots"
278,CANTO II,"Upon this body, which below on earth"
279,CANTO II,"Give rise to talk of Cain in fabling quaint?"""
280,CANTO II,
281,CANTO II,"She somewhat smil'd, then spake: ""If mortals err"
282,CANTO II,"In their opinion, when the key of sense"
283,CANTO II,"Unlocks not, surely wonder's weapon keen"
284,CANTO II,"Ought not to pierce thee; since thou find'st, the wings"
285,CANTO II,Of reason to pursue the senses' flight
286,CANTO II,"Are short.  But what thy own thought is, declare."""
287,CANTO II,
288,CANTO II,"Then I: ""What various here above appears,"
289,CANTO II,"Is caus'd, I deem, by bodies dense or rare."""
290,CANTO II,
291,CANTO II,"She then resum'd: ""Thou certainly wilt see"
292,CANTO II,"In falsehood thy belief o'erwhelm'd, if well"
293,CANTO II,"Thou listen to the arguments, which I"
294,CANTO II,Shall bring to face it.  The eighth sphere displays
295,CANTO II,"Numberless lights, the which in kind and size"
296,CANTO II,May be remark'd of different aspects;
297,CANTO II,"If rare or dense of that were cause alone,"
298,CANTO II,"One single virtue then would be in all,"
299,CANTO II,"Alike distributed, or more, or less."
300,CANTO II,Different virtues needs must be the fruits
301,CANTO II,"Of formal principles, and these, save one,"
302,CANTO II,"Will by thy reasoning be destroy'd.  Beside,"
303,CANTO II,"If rarity were of that dusk the cause,"
304,CANTO II,"Which thou inquirest, either in some part"
305,CANTO II,"That planet must throughout be void, nor fed"
306,CANTO II,"With its own matter; or, as bodies share"
307,CANTO II,"Their fat and leanness, in like manner this"
308,CANTO II,"Must in its volume change the leaves.  The first,"
309,CANTO II,"If it were true, had through the sun's eclipse"
310,CANTO II,"Been manifested, by transparency"
311,CANTO II,"Of light, as through aught rare beside effus'd."
312,CANTO II,But this is not.  Therefore remains to see
313,CANTO II,"The other cause: and if the other fall,"
314,CANTO II,Erroneous so must prove what seem'd to thee.
315,CANTO II,If not from side to side this rarity
316,CANTO II,"Pass through, there needs must be a limit, whence"
317,CANTO II,Its contrary no further lets it pass.
318,CANTO II,"And hence the beam, that from without proceeds,"
319,CANTO II,"Must be pour'd back, as colour comes, through glass"
320,CANTO II,"Reflected, which behind it lead conceals."
321,CANTO II,"Now wilt thou say, that there of murkier hue"
322,CANTO II,"Than in the other part the ray is shown,"
323,CANTO II,By being thence refracted farther back.
324,CANTO II,From this perplexity will free thee soon
325,CANTO II,"Experience, if thereof thou trial make,"
326,CANTO II,The fountain whence your arts derive their streame.
327,CANTO II,"Three mirrors shalt thou take, and two remove"
328,CANTO II,"From thee alike, and more remote the third."
329,CANTO II,"Betwixt the former pair, shall meet thine eyes;"
330,CANTO II,"Then turn'd toward them, cause behind thy back"
331,CANTO II,"A light to stand, that on the three shall shine,"
332,CANTO II,And thus reflected come to thee from all.
333,CANTO II,Though that beheld most distant do not stretch
334,CANTO II,"A space so ample, yet in brightness thou"
335,CANTO II,"Will own it equaling the rest.  But now,"
336,CANTO II,"As under snow the ground, if the warm ray"
337,CANTO II,"Smites it, remains dismantled of the hue"
338,CANTO II,"And cold, that cover'd it before, so thee,"
339,CANTO II,"Dismantled in thy mind, I will inform"
340,CANTO II,"With light so lively, that the tremulous beam"
341,CANTO II,"Shall quiver where it falls.  Within the heaven,"
342,CANTO II,"Where peace divine inhabits, circles round"
343,CANTO II,"A body, in whose virtue dies the being"
344,CANTO II,"Of all that it contains.  The following heaven,"
345,CANTO II,"That hath so many lights, this being divides,"
346,CANTO II,"Through  different essences, from it distinct,"
347,CANTO II,And yet contain'd within it.  The other orbs
348,CANTO II,Their separate distinctions variously
349,CANTO II,"Dispose, for their own seed and produce apt."
350,CANTO II,"Thus do these organs of the world proceed,"
351,CANTO II,"As thou beholdest now, from step to step,"
352,CANTO II,"Their influences from above deriving,"
353,CANTO II,"And thence transmitting downwards.  Mark me well,"
354,CANTO II,"How through this passage to the truth I ford,"
355,CANTO II,"The truth thou lov'st, that thou henceforth alone,"
356,CANTO II,"May'st know to keep the shallows, safe, untold."
357,CANTO II,
358,CANTO II,"""The virtue and motion of the sacred orbs,"
359,CANTO II,"As mallet by the workman's hand, must needs"
360,CANTO II,"By blessed movers be inspir'd.  This heaven,"
361,CANTO II,"Made beauteous by so many luminaries,"
362,CANTO II,"From the deep spirit, that moves its circling sphere,"
363,CANTO II,Its image takes an impress as a seal:
364,CANTO II,"And as the soul, that dwells within your dust,"
365,CANTO II,"Through members different, yet together form'd,"
366,CANTO II,In different pow'rs resolves itself; e'en so
367,CANTO II,The intellectual efficacy unfolds
368,CANTO II,Its goodness multiplied throughout the stars;
369,CANTO II,On its own unity revolving still.
370,CANTO II,Different virtue compact different
371,CANTO II,"Makes with the precious body it enlivens,"
372,CANTO II,"With which it knits, as life in you is knit."
373,CANTO II,"From its original nature full of joy,"
374,CANTO II,"The virtue mingled through the body shines,"
375,CANTO II,As joy through pupil of the living eye.
376,CANTO II,"From hence proceeds, that which from light to light"
377,CANTO II,"Seems different, and not from dense or rare."
378,CANTO II,"This is the formal cause, that generates"
379,CANTO II,"Proportion'd to its power, the dusk or clear."""
380,CANTO II,
381,CANTO II,
382,CANTO II,
383,CANTO II,
384,CANTO III,CANTO III
385,CANTO III,
386,CANTO III,"That sun, which erst with love my bosom warm'd"
387,CANTO III,"Had of fair truth unveil'd the sweet aspect,"
388,CANTO III,"By proof of right, and of the false reproof;"
389,CANTO III,"And I, to own myself convinc'd and free"
390,CANTO III,"Of doubt, as much as needed, rais'd my head"
391,CANTO III,"Erect for speech.  But soon a sight appear'd,"
392,CANTO III,"Which, so intent to mark it, held me fix'd,"
393,CANTO III,That of confession I no longer thought.
394,CANTO III,
395,CANTO III,"As through translucent and smooth glass, or wave"
396,CANTO III,"Clear and unmov'd, and flowing not so deep"
397,CANTO III,"As that its bed is dark, the shape returns"
398,CANTO III,"So faint of our impictur'd lineaments,"
399,CANTO III,That on white forehead set a pearl as strong
400,CANTO III,"Comes to the eye: such saw I many a face,"
401,CANTO III,"All stretch'd to speak, from whence I straight conceiv'd"
402,CANTO III,"Delusion opposite to that, which rais'd"
403,CANTO III,"Between the man and fountain, amorous flame."
404,CANTO III,
405,CANTO III,"Sudden, as I perceiv'd them, deeming these"
406,CANTO III,Reflected semblances to see of whom
407,CANTO III,"They were, I turn'd mine eyes, and nothing saw;"
408,CANTO III,"Then turn'd them back, directed on the light"
409,CANTO III,"Of my sweet guide, who smiling shot forth beams"
410,CANTO III,"From her celestial eyes.  ""Wonder not thou,"""
411,CANTO III,"She cry'd, ""at this my smiling, when I see"
412,CANTO III,Thy childish judgment; since not yet on truth
413,CANTO III,"It rests the foot, but, as it still is wont,"
414,CANTO III,Makes thee fall back in unsound vacancy.
415,CANTO III,"True substances are these, which thou behold'st,"
416,CANTO III,Hither through failure of their vow exil'd.
417,CANTO III,"But speak thou with them; listen, and believe,"
418,CANTO III,"That the true light, which fills them with desire,"
419,CANTO III,"Permits not from its beams their feet to stray."""
420,CANTO III,
421,CANTO III,Straight to the shadow which for converse seem'd
422,CANTO III,"Most earnest, I addressed me, and began,"
423,CANTO III,As one by over-eagerness perplex'd:
424,CANTO III,"""O spirit, born for joy! who in the rays"
425,CANTO III,"Of life eternal, of that sweetness know'st"
426,CANTO III,"The flavour, which, not tasted, passes far"
427,CANTO III,"All apprehension, me it well would please,"
428,CANTO III,"If thou wouldst tell me of thy name, and this"
429,CANTO III,"Your station here."" Whence she, with kindness prompt,"
430,CANTO III,"And eyes glist'ning with smiles: ""Our charity,"
431,CANTO III,"To any wish by justice introduc'd,"
432,CANTO III,"Bars not the door, no more than she above,"
433,CANTO III,Who would have all her court be like herself.
434,CANTO III,I was a virgin sister in the earth;
435,CANTO III,"And if thy mind observe me well, this form,"
436,CANTO III,"With such addition grac'd of loveliness,"
437,CANTO III,"Will not conceal me long, but thou wilt know"
438,CANTO III,"Piccarda, in the tardiest sphere thus plac'd,"
439,CANTO III,Here 'mid these other blessed also blest.
440,CANTO III,"Our hearts, whose high affections burn alone"
441,CANTO III,"With pleasure, from the Holy Spirit conceiv'd,"
442,CANTO III,Admitted to his order dwell in joy.
443,CANTO III,"And this condition, which appears so low,"
444,CANTO III,"Is for this cause assign'd us, that our vows"
445,CANTO III,"Were in some part neglected and made void."""
446,CANTO III,
447,CANTO III,"Whence I to her replied: ""Something divine"
448,CANTO III,"Beams in your countenance, wond'rous fair,"
449,CANTO III,From former knowledge quite transmuting you.
450,CANTO III,Therefore to recollect was I so slow.
451,CANTO III,But what thou sayst hath to my memory
452,CANTO III,"Given now such aid, that to retrace your forms"
453,CANTO III,"Is easier.  Yet inform me, ye, who here"
454,CANTO III,"Are happy, long ye for a higher place"
455,CANTO III,"More to behold, and more in love to dwell?"""
456,CANTO III,
457,CANTO III,"She with those other spirits gently smil'd,"
458,CANTO III,"Then answer'd with such gladness, that she seem'd"
459,CANTO III,"With love's first flame to glow: ""Brother! our will"
460,CANTO III,Is in composure settled by the power
461,CANTO III,"Of charity, who makes us will alone"
462,CANTO III,"What we possess, and nought beyond desire;"
463,CANTO III,"If we should wish to be exalted more,"
464,CANTO III,Then must our wishes jar with the high will
465,CANTO III,"Of him, who sets us here, which in these orbs"
466,CANTO III,"Thou wilt confess not possible, if here"
467,CANTO III,"To be in charity must needs befall,"
468,CANTO III,And if her nature well thou contemplate.
469,CANTO III,Rather it is inherent in this state
470,CANTO III,"Of blessedness, to keep ourselves within"
471,CANTO III,"The divine will, by which our wills with his"
472,CANTO III,Are one.  So that as we from step to step
473,CANTO III,"Are plac'd throughout this kingdom, pleases all,"
474,CANTO III,"E'en as our King, who in us plants his will;"
475,CANTO III,And in his will is our tranquillity;
476,CANTO III,"It is the mighty ocean, whither tends"
477,CANTO III,"Whatever it creates and nature makes."""
478,CANTO III,
479,CANTO III,Then saw I clearly how each spot in heav'n
480,CANTO III,"Is Paradise, though with like gracious dew"
481,CANTO III,The supreme virtue show'r not over all.
482,CANTO III,
483,CANTO III,"But as it chances, if one sort of food"
484,CANTO III,"Hath satiated, and of another still"
485,CANTO III,"The appetite remains, that this is ask'd,"
486,CANTO III,And thanks for that return'd; e'en so did I
487,CANTO III,"In word and motion, bent from her to learn"
488,CANTO III,"What web it was, through which she had not drawn"
489,CANTO III,The shuttle to its point.  She thus began:
490,CANTO III,"""Exalted worth and perfectness of life"
491,CANTO III,"The Lady higher up enshrine in heaven,"
492,CANTO III,By whose pure laws upon your nether earth
493,CANTO III,"The robe and veil they wear, to that intent,"
494,CANTO III,That e'en till death they may keep watch or sleep
495,CANTO III,"With their great bridegroom, who accepts each vow,"
496,CANTO III,Which to his gracious pleasure love conforms.
497,CANTO III,"from the world, to follow her, when young"
498,CANTO III,"Escap'd; and, in her vesture mantling me,"
499,CANTO III,Made promise of the way her sect enjoins.
500,CANTO III,"Thereafter men, for ill than good more apt,"
501,CANTO III,Forth snatch'd me from the pleasant cloister's pale.
502,CANTO III,God knows how after that my life was fram'd.
503,CANTO III,"This other splendid shape, which thou beholdst"
504,CANTO III,"At my right side, burning with all the light"
505,CANTO III,"Of this our orb, what of myself I tell"
506,CANTO III,"May to herself apply.  From her, like me"
507,CANTO III,"A sister, with like violence were torn"
508,CANTO III,"The saintly folds, that shaded her fair brows."
509,CANTO III,E'en when she to the world again was brought
510,CANTO III,"In spite of her own will and better wont,"
511,CANTO III,Yet not for that the bosom's inward veil
512,CANTO III,Did she renounce.  This is the luminary
513,CANTO III,"Of mighty Constance, who from that loud blast,"
514,CANTO III,"Which blew the second over Suabia's realm,"
515,CANTO III,"That power produc'd, which was the third and last."""
516,CANTO III,
517,CANTO III,"She ceas'd from further talk, and then began"
518,CANTO III,"""Ave Maria"" singing, and with that song"
519,CANTO III,"Vanish'd, as heavy substance through deep wave."
520,CANTO III,
521,CANTO III,"Mine eye, that far as it was capable,"
522,CANTO III,"Pursued her, when in dimness she was lost,"
523,CANTO III,"Turn'd to the mark where greater want impell'd,"
524,CANTO III,And bent on Beatrice all its gaze.
525,CANTO III,But she as light'ning beam'd upon my looks:
526,CANTO III,So that the sight sustain'd it not at first.
527,CANTO III,Whence I to question her became less prompt.
528,CANTO III,
529,CANTO III,
530,CANTO III,
531,CANTO III,
532,CANTO IV,CANTO IV
533,CANTO IV,
534,CANTO IV,"Between two kinds of food, both equally"
535,CANTO IV,"Remote and tempting, first a man might die"
536,CANTO IV,"Of hunger, ere he one could freely choose."
537,CANTO IV,E'en so would stand a lamb between the maw
538,CANTO IV,"Of two fierce wolves, in dread of both alike:"
539,CANTO IV,"E'en so between two deer a dog would stand,"
540,CANTO IV,"Wherefore, if I was silent, fault nor praise"
541,CANTO IV,"I to myself impute, by equal doubts"
542,CANTO IV,"Held in suspense, since of necessity"
543,CANTO IV,"It happen'd.  Silent was I, yet desire"
544,CANTO IV,Was painted in my looks; and thus I spake
545,CANTO IV,My wish more earnestly than language could.
546,CANTO IV,
547,CANTO IV,"As Daniel, when the haughty king he freed"
548,CANTO IV,"From ire, that spurr'd him on to deeds unjust"
549,CANTO IV,And violent; so look'd Beatrice then.
550,CANTO IV,
551,CANTO IV,"""Well I discern,"" she thus her words address'd,"
552,CANTO IV,"""How contrary desires each way constrain thee,"
553,CANTO IV,So that thy anxious thought is in itself
554,CANTO IV,"Bound up and stifled, nor breathes freely forth."
555,CANTO IV,Thou arguest; if the good intent remain;
556,CANTO IV,What reason that another's violence
557,CANTO IV,Should stint the measure of my fair desert?
558,CANTO IV,
559,CANTO IV,"""Cause too thou findst for doubt, in that it seems,"
560,CANTO IV,"That spirits to the stars, as Plato deem'd,"
561,CANTO IV,Return.  These are the questions which thy will
562,CANTO IV,Urge equally; and therefore I the first
563,CANTO IV,Of that will treat which hath the more of gall.
564,CANTO IV,"Of seraphim he who is most ensky'd,"
565,CANTO IV,"Moses and Samuel, and either John,"
566,CANTO IV,"Choose which thou wilt, nor even Mary's self,"
567,CANTO IV,"Have not in any other heav'n their seats,"
568,CANTO IV,Than have those spirits which so late thou saw'st;
569,CANTO IV,Nor more or fewer years exist; but all
570,CANTO IV,"Make the first circle beauteous, diversely"
571,CANTO IV,"Partaking of sweet life, as more or less"
572,CANTO IV,Afflation of eternal bliss pervades them.
573,CANTO IV,"Here were they shown thee, not that fate assigns"
574,CANTO IV,"This for their sphere, but for a sign to thee"
575,CANTO IV,Of that celestial furthest from the height.
576,CANTO IV,"Thus needs, that ye may apprehend, we speak:"
577,CANTO IV,Since from things sensible alone ye learn
578,CANTO IV,"That, which digested rightly after turns"
579,CANTO IV,To intellectual.  For no other cause
580,CANTO IV,"The scripture, condescending graciously"
581,CANTO IV,"To your perception, hands and feet to God"
582,CANTO IV,"Attributes, nor so means: and holy church"
583,CANTO IV,Doth represent with human countenance
584,CANTO IV,"Gabriel, and Michael, and him who made"
585,CANTO IV,"Tobias whole.  Unlike what here thou seest,"
586,CANTO IV,"The judgment of Timaeus, who affirms"
587,CANTO IV,"Each soul restor'd to its particular star,"
588,CANTO IV,"Believing it to have been taken thence,"
589,CANTO IV,When nature gave it to inform her mold:
590,CANTO IV,Since to appearance his intention is
591,CANTO IV,E'en what his words declare: or else to shun
592,CANTO IV,"Derision, haply thus he hath disguis'd"
593,CANTO IV,"His true opinion.  If his meaning be,"
594,CANTO IV,That to the influencing of these orbs revert
595,CANTO IV,"The honour and the blame in human acts,"
596,CANTO IV,Perchance he doth not wholly miss the truth.
597,CANTO IV,"This principle, not understood aright,"
598,CANTO IV,Erewhile perverted well nigh all the world;
599,CANTO IV,"So that it fell to fabled names of Jove,"
600,CANTO IV,"And Mercury, and Mars.  That other doubt,"
601,CANTO IV,"Which moves thee, is less harmful; for it brings"
602,CANTO IV,No peril of removing thee from me.
603,CANTO IV,
604,CANTO IV,"""That, to the eye of man, our justice seems"
605,CANTO IV,"Unjust, is argument for faith, and not"
606,CANTO IV,For heretic declension.  To the end
607,CANTO IV,"This truth may stand more clearly in your view,"
608,CANTO IV,I will content thee even to thy wish
609,CANTO IV,
610,CANTO IV,"""If violence be, when that which suffers, nought"
611,CANTO IV,"Consents to that which forceth, not for this"
612,CANTO IV,"These spirits stood exculpate.  For the will,"
613,CANTO IV,"That will not, still survives unquench'd, and doth"
614,CANTO IV,"As nature doth in fire, tho' violence"
615,CANTO IV,"Wrest it a thousand times; for, if it yield"
616,CANTO IV,"Or more or less, so far it follows force."
617,CANTO IV,"And thus did these, whom they had power to seek"
618,CANTO IV,"The hallow'd place again.  In them, had will"
619,CANTO IV,"Been perfect, such as once upon the bars"
620,CANTO IV,"Held Laurence firm, or wrought in Scaevola"
621,CANTO IV,"To his own hand remorseless, to the path,"
622,CANTO IV,"Whence they were drawn, their steps had hasten'd back,"
623,CANTO IV,When liberty return'd: but in too few
624,CANTO IV,Resolve so steadfast dwells.  And by these words
625,CANTO IV,"If duly weigh'd, that argument is void,"
626,CANTO IV,Which oft might have perplex'd thee still.  But now
627,CANTO IV,"Another question thwarts thee, which to solve"
628,CANTO IV,Might try thy patience without better aid.
629,CANTO IV,"I have, no doubt, instill'd into thy mind,"
630,CANTO IV,That blessed spirit may not lie; since near
631,CANTO IV,The source of primal truth it dwells for aye:
632,CANTO IV,And thou might'st after of Piccarda learn
633,CANTO IV,That Constance held affection to the veil;
634,CANTO IV,So that she seems to contradict me here.
635,CANTO IV,"Not seldom, brother, it hath chanc'd for men"
636,CANTO IV,"To do what they had gladly left undone,"
637,CANTO IV,Yet to shun peril they have done amiss:
638,CANTO IV,"E'en as Alcmaeon, at his father's suit"
639,CANTO IV,"Slew his own mother, so made pitiless"
640,CANTO IV,"Not to lose pity.  On this point bethink thee,"
641,CANTO IV,That force and will are blended in such wise
642,CANTO IV,As not to make the' offence excusable.
643,CANTO IV,"Absolute will agrees not to the wrong,"
644,CANTO IV,That inasmuch as there is fear of woe
645,CANTO IV,"From non-compliance, it agrees.  Of will"
646,CANTO IV,"Thus absolute Piccarda spake, and I"
647,CANTO IV,"Of th' other; so that both have truly said."""
648,CANTO IV,
649,CANTO IV,"Such was the flow of that pure rill, that well'd"
650,CANTO IV,From forth the fountain of all truth; and such
651,CANTO IV,"The rest, that to my wond'ring thoughts I found."
652,CANTO IV,
653,CANTO IV,"""O thou of primal love the prime delight!"
654,CANTO IV,"Goddess!""  I straight reply'd, ""whose lively words"
655,CANTO IV,Still shed new heat and vigour through my soul!
656,CANTO IV,Affection fails me to requite thy grace
657,CANTO IV,With equal sum of gratitude: be his
658,CANTO IV,"To recompense, who sees and can reward thee."
659,CANTO IV,"Well I discern, that by that truth alone"
660,CANTO IV,"Enlighten'd, beyond which no truth may roam,"
661,CANTO IV,Our mind can satisfy her thirst to know:
662,CANTO IV,"Therein she resteth, e'en as in his lair"
663,CANTO IV,"The wild beast, soon as she hath reach'd that bound,"
664,CANTO IV,And she hath power to reach it; else desire
665,CANTO IV,Were given to no end.  And thence doth doubt
666,CANTO IV,"Spring, like a shoot, around the stock of truth;"
667,CANTO IV,And it is nature which from height to height
668,CANTO IV,"On to the summit prompts us.  This invites,"
669,CANTO IV,"This doth assure me, lady, rev'rently"
670,CANTO IV,"To ask thee of other truth, that yet"
671,CANTO IV,"Is dark to me.  I fain would know, if man"
672,CANTO IV,By other works well done may so supply
673,CANTO IV,"The failure of his vows, that in your scale"
674,CANTO IV,"They lack not weight.""  I spake; and on me straight"
675,CANTO IV,Beatrice look'd with eyes that shot forth sparks
676,CANTO IV,"Of love celestial in such copious stream,"
677,CANTO IV,"That, virtue sinking in me overpower'd,"
678,CANTO IV,"I turn'd, and downward bent confus'd my sight."
679,CANTO IV,
680,CANTO IV,
681,CANTO IV,
682,CANTO IV,
683,CANTO V,CANTO V
684,CANTO V,
685,CANTO V,"""If beyond earthly wont, the flame of love"
686,CANTO V,"Illume me, so that I o'ercome thy power"
687,CANTO V,"Of vision, marvel not: but learn the cause"
688,CANTO V,"In that perfection of the sight, which soon"
689,CANTO V,"As apprehending, hasteneth on to reach"
690,CANTO V,"The good it apprehends.  I well discern,"
691,CANTO V,How in thine intellect already shines
692,CANTO V,"The light eternal, which to view alone"
693,CANTO V,Ne'er fails to kindle love; and if aught else
694,CANTO V,"Your love seduces, 't is but that it shows"
695,CANTO V,Some ill-mark'd vestige of that primal beam.
696,CANTO V,
697,CANTO V,"""This would'st thou know, if failure of the vow"
698,CANTO V,"By other service may be so supplied,"
699,CANTO V,"As from self-question to assure the soul."""
700,CANTO V,
701,CANTO V,"Thus she her words, not heedless of my wish,"
702,CANTO V,"Began; and thus, as one who breaks not off"
703,CANTO V,"Discourse, continued in her saintly strain."
704,CANTO V,"""Supreme of gifts, which God creating gave"
705,CANTO V,"Of his free bounty, sign most evident"
706,CANTO V,"Of goodness, and in his account most priz'd,"
707,CANTO V,"Was liberty of will, the boon wherewith"
708,CANTO V,"All intellectual creatures, and them sole"
709,CANTO V,He hath endow'd.  Hence now thou mayst infer
710,CANTO V,"Of what high worth the vow, which so is fram'd"
711,CANTO V,"That when man offers, God well-pleas'd accepts;"
712,CANTO V,"For in the compact between God and him,"
713,CANTO V,"This treasure, such as I describe it to thee,"
714,CANTO V,"He makes the victim, and of his own act."
715,CANTO V,What compensation therefore may he find?
716,CANTO V,"If that, whereof thou hast oblation made,"
717,CANTO V,"By using well thou think'st to consecrate,"
718,CANTO V,Thou would'st of theft do charitable deed.
719,CANTO V,Thus I resolve thee of the greater point.
720,CANTO V,
721,CANTO V,"""But forasmuch as holy church, herein"
722,CANTO V,"Dispensing, seems to contradict the truth"
723,CANTO V,"I have discover'd to thee, yet behooves"
724,CANTO V,"Thou rest a little longer at the board,"
725,CANTO V,"Ere the crude aliment, which thou hast taken,"
726,CANTO V,Digested fitly to nutrition turn.
727,CANTO V,"Open thy mind to what I now unfold,"
728,CANTO V,And give it inward keeping.  Knowledge comes
729,CANTO V,"Of learning well retain'd, unfruitful else."
730,CANTO V,
731,CANTO V,"""This sacrifice in essence of two things"
732,CANTO V,"Consisteth; one is that, whereof 't is made,"
733,CANTO V,"The covenant the other.  For the last,"
734,CANTO V,It ne'er is cancell'd if not kept: and hence
735,CANTO V,I spake erewhile so strictly of its force.
736,CANTO V,"For this it was enjoin'd the Israelites,"
737,CANTO V,"Though leave were giv'n them, as thou know'st, to change"
738,CANTO V,"The offering, still to offer.  Th' other part,"
739,CANTO V,"The matter and the substance of the vow,"
740,CANTO V,"May well be such, to that without offence"
741,CANTO V,It may for other substance be exchang'd.
742,CANTO V,But at his own discretion none may shift
743,CANTO V,"The burden on his shoulders, unreleas'd"
744,CANTO V,"By either key, the yellow and the white."
745,CANTO V,"Nor deem of any change, as less than vain,"
746,CANTO V,If the last bond be not within the new
747,CANTO V,"Included, as the quatre in the six."
748,CANTO V,No satisfaction therefore can be paid
749,CANTO V,"For what so precious in the balance weighs,"
750,CANTO V,That all in counterpoise must kick the beam.
751,CANTO V,"Take then no vow at random: ta'en, with faith"
752,CANTO V,"Preserve it; yet not bent, as Jephthah once,"
753,CANTO V,"Blindly to execute a rash resolve,"
754,CANTO V,"Whom better it had suited to exclaim,"
755,CANTO V,"'I have done ill,' than to redeem his pledge"
756,CANTO V,"By doing worse or, not unlike to him"
757,CANTO V,"In folly, that great leader of the Greeks:"
758,CANTO V,"Whence, on the alter, Iphigenia mourn'd"
759,CANTO V,"Her virgin beauty, and hath since made mourn"
760,CANTO V,"Both wise and simple, even all, who hear"
761,CANTO V,"Of so fell sacrifice.  Be ye more staid,"
762,CANTO V,"O Christians, not, like feather, by each wind"
763,CANTO V,Removable: nor think to cleanse ourselves
764,CANTO V,"In every water.  Either testament,"
765,CANTO V,"The old and new, is yours: and for your guide"
766,CANTO V,The shepherd of the church let this suffice
767,CANTO V,"To save you.  When by evil lust entic'd,"
768,CANTO V,"Remember ye be men, not senseless beasts;"
769,CANTO V,"Nor let the Jew, who dwelleth in your streets,"
770,CANTO V,"Hold you in mock'ry.  Be not, as the lamb,"
771,CANTO V,"That, fickle wanton, leaves its mother's milk,"
772,CANTO V,"To dally with itself in idle play."""
773,CANTO V,
774,CANTO V,Such were the words that Beatrice spake:
775,CANTO V,"These ended, to that region, where the world"
776,CANTO V,"Is liveliest, full of fond desire she turn'd."
777,CANTO V,
778,CANTO V,"Though mainly prompt new question to propose,"
779,CANTO V,Her silence and chang'd look did keep me dumb.
780,CANTO V,"And as the arrow, ere the cord is still,"
781,CANTO V,Leapeth unto its mark; so on we sped
782,CANTO V,Into the second realm.  There I beheld
783,CANTO V,"The dame, so joyous enter, that the orb"
784,CANTO V,"Grew brighter at her smiles; and, if the star"
785,CANTO V,"Were mov'd to gladness, what then was my cheer,"
786,CANTO V,Whom nature hath made apt for every change!
787,CANTO V,
788,CANTO V,"As in a quiet and clear lake the fish,"
789,CANTO V,"If aught approach them from without, do draw"
790,CANTO V,"Towards it, deeming it their food; so drew"
791,CANTO V,"Full more than thousand splendours towards us,"
792,CANTO V,"And in each one was heard: ""Lo! one arriv'd"
793,CANTO V,"To multiply our loves!"" and as each came"
794,CANTO V,"The shadow, streaming forth effulgence new,"
795,CANTO V,"Witness'd augmented joy.  Here, reader! think,"
796,CANTO V,"If thou didst miss the sequel of my tale,"
797,CANTO V,To know the rest how sorely thou wouldst crave;
798,CANTO V,And thou shalt see what vehement desire
799,CANTO V,"Possess'd me, as soon as these had met my view,"
800,CANTO V,"To know their state.  ""O born in happy hour!"
801,CANTO V,"Thou to whom grace vouchsafes, or ere thy close"
802,CANTO V,"Of fleshly warfare, to behold the thrones"
803,CANTO V,"Of that eternal triumph, know to us"
804,CANTO V,"The light communicated, which through heaven"
805,CANTO V,"Expatiates without bound.  Therefore, if aught"
806,CANTO V,"Thou of our beams wouldst borrow for thine aid,"
807,CANTO V,"Spare not; and of our radiance take thy fill."""
808,CANTO V,

855,CANTO VI,"By inspiration of God's grace impell'd,"
856,CANTO VI,"I gave me wholly, and consign'd mine arms"
857,CANTO VI,"To Belisarius, with whom heaven's right hand"

887,CANTO VI,"Scipio and Pompey triumph'd; and that hill,"
888,CANTO VI,"Under whose summit thou didst see the light,"

890,CANTO VI,When heav'n was minded that o'er all the world
891,CANTO VI,"His own deep calm should brood, to Caesar's hand"
892,CANTO VI,Did Rome consign it; and what then it wrought
893,CANTO VI,"From Var unto the Rhine, saw Isere's flood,"

903,CANTO VI,"Of Simois revisited, and there"
904,CANTO VI,Where Hector lies; then ill for Ptolemy
905,CANTO VI,His pennons shook again; lightning thence fell

957,CANTO VI,"And, when desires thus err in their intention,"
958,CANTO VI,True love must needs ascend with slacker beam.
959,CANTO VI,"But it is part of our delight, to measure"
960,CANTO VI,Our wages with the merit; and admire
961,CANTO VI,The close proportion.  Hence doth heav'nly justice

1019,CANTO VII,"The nature, from its Maker far estrang'd,"
1020,CANTO VII,By the mere act of his eternal love.
1021,CANTO VII,Contemplate here the wonder I unfold.
1022,CANTO VII,"The nature with its Maker thus conjoin'd,"
1023,CANTO VII,"Created first was blameless, pure and good;"
1024,CANTO VII,But through itself alone was driven forth
1025,CANTO VII,"From Paradise, because it had eschew'd"
1026,CANTO VII,"The way of truth and life, to evil turn'd."
1027,CANTO VII,Ne'er then was penalty so just as that
1028,CANTO VII,"Inflicted by the cross, if thou regard"
1029,CANTO VII,The nature in assumption doom'd: ne'er wrong
1030,CANTO VII,"So great, in reference to him, who took"
1031,CANTO VII,"Such nature on him, and endur'd the doom."
1032,CANTO VII,God therefore and the Jews one sentence pleased:
1033,CANTO VII,"So different effects flow'd from one act,"
1034,CANTO VII,"And heav'n was open'd, though the earth did quake."
1035,CANTO VII,"Count it not hard henceforth, when thou dost hear"
1036,CANTO VII,That a just vengeance was by righteous court
1037,CANTO VII,Justly reveng'd.  But yet I see thy mind
1038,CANTO VII,"By thought on thought arising sore perplex'd,"
1039,CANTO VII,And with how vehement desire it asks
1040,CANTO VII,"Solution of the maze.  What I have heard,"
1041,CANTO VII,"Is plain, thou sayst: but wherefore God this way"
1042,CANTO VII,"For our redemption chose, eludes my search."

1044,CANTO VII,"""Brother! no eye of man not perfected,"
1045,CANTO VII,"Nor fully ripen'd in the flame of love,"
1046,CANTO VII,"May fathom this decree.  It is a mark,"
1047,CANTO VII,"In sooth, much aim'd at, and but little kenn'd:"
1048,CANTO VII,And I will therefore show thee why such way
1049,CANTO VII,"Was worthiest.  The celestial love, that spume"
1050,CANTO VII,"All envying in its bounty, in itself"

1055,CANTO VII,"Whatever thence immediate falls, is free,"

1057,CANTO VII,Of each thing new: by such conformity
1058,CANTO VII,"More grateful to its author, whose bright beams,"
1059,CANTO VII,"Though all partake their shining, yet in those"
1060,CANTO VII,"Are liveliest, which resemble him the most."
1061,CANTO VII,These tokens of pre-eminence on man
1062,CANTO VII,"Largely bestow'd, if any of them fail,"
1063,CANTO VII,"He needs must forfeit his nobility,"
1064,CANTO VII,"No longer stainless.  Sin alone is that,"
1065,CANTO VII,"Which doth disfranchise him, and make unlike"
1066,CANTO VII,To the chief good; for that its light in him
1067,CANTO VII,Is darken'd.  And to dignity thus lost
1068,CANTO VII,"Is no return; unless, where guilt makes void,"

1088,CANTO VII,And for this reason he had vainly tried
1089,CANTO VII,Out of his own sufficiency to pay
1090,CANTO VII,The rigid satisfaction.  Then behooved
1091,CANTO VII,That God should by his own ways lead him back
1092,CANTO VII,"Unto the life, from whence he fell, restor'd:"
1093,CANTO VII,"By both his ways, I mean, or one alone."
1094,CANTO VII,"But since the deed is ever priz'd the more,"
1095,CANTO VII,"The more the doer's good intent appears,"
1096,CANTO VII,"Goodness celestial, whose broad signature"
1097,CANTO VII,"Is on the universe, of all its ways"
1098,CANTO VII,"To raise ye up, was fain to leave out none,"

1194,CANTO VIII,"Sought the celestial guide, and were by her"
1195,CANTO VIII,"Assur'd, they turn'd again unto the light"
1196,CANTO VIII,"Who had so largely promis'd, and with voice"
1197,CANTO VIII,"That bare the lively pressure of my zeal,"
1198,CANTO VIII,"""Tell who ye are,"" I cried.  Forthwith it grew"
1199,CANTO VIII,"In size and splendour, through augmented joy;"
1200,CANTO VIII,"And thus it answer'd: ""A short date below"
1201,CANTO VIII,"The world possess'd me.  Had the time been more,"
1202,CANTO VIII,"Much evil, that will come, had never chanc'd."
1203,CANTO VIII,"My gladness hides thee from me, which doth shine"
1204,CANTO VIII,"Around, and shroud me, as an animal"
1205,CANTO VIII,"In its own silk unswath'd.  Thou lov'dst me well,"
1206,CANTO VIII,And had'st good cause; for had my sojourning
1207,CANTO VIII,"Been longer on the earth, the love I bare thee"
1208,CANTO VIII,"Had put forth more than blossoms.  The left bank,"
1209,CANTO VIII,"That Rhone, when he hath mix'd with Sorga, laves."
1210,CANTO VIII,
1211,CANTO VIII,"""In me its lord expected, and that horn"
1212,CANTO VIII,"Of fair Ausonia, with its boroughs old,"
1213,CANTO VIII,"Bari, and Croton, and Gaeta pil'd,"
1214,CANTO VIII,"From where the Trento disembogues his waves,"
1215,CANTO VIII,"With Verde mingled, to the salt sea-flood."
1216,CANTO VIII,"Already on my temples beam'd the crown,"
1217,CANTO VIII,Which gave me sov'reignty over the land
1218,CANTO VIII,"By Danube wash'd, whenas he strays beyond"
1219,CANTO VIII,"The limits of his German shores.  The realm,"
1220,CANTO VIII,"Where, on the gulf by stormy Eurus lash'd,"
1221,CANTO VIII,"Betwixt Pelorus and Pachynian heights,"
1222,CANTO VIII,The beautiful Trinacria lies in gloom
1223,CANTO VIII,"(Not through Typhaeus, but the vap'ry cloud"
1224,CANTO VIII,"Bituminous upsteam'd), THAT too did look"
1225,CANTO VIII,To have its scepter wielded by a race
1226,CANTO VIII,"Of monarchs, sprung through me from Charles and Rodolph;"
1227,CANTO VIII,had not ill lording which doth spirit up
1228,CANTO VIII,"The people ever, in Palermo rais'd"
1229,CANTO VIII,"The shout of 'death,' re-echo'd loud and long."
1230,CANTO VIII,"Had but my brother's foresight kenn'd as much,"
1231,CANTO VIII,He had been warier that the greedy want
1232,CANTO VIII,Of Catalonia might not work his bale.
1233,CANTO VIII,"And truly need there is, that he forecast,"
1234,CANTO VIII,"Or other for him, lest more freight be laid"
1235,CANTO VIII,On his already over-laden bark.
1236,CANTO VIII,"Nature in him, from bounty fall'n to thrift,"
1237,CANTO VIII,"Would ask the  guard of braver arms, than such"
1238,CANTO VIII,"As only care to have their coffers fill'd."""
1239,CANTO VIII,
1240,CANTO VIII,"""My liege, it doth enhance the joy thy words"
1241,CANTO VIII,"Infuse into me, mighty as it is,"
1242,CANTO VIII,"To think my gladness manifest to thee,"
1243,CANTO VIII,"As to myself, who own it, when thou lookst"
1244,CANTO VIII,"Into the source and limit of all good,"
1245,CANTO VIII,"There, where thou markest that which thou dost speak,"
1246,CANTO VIII,Thence priz'd of me the more.  Glad thou hast made me.
1247,CANTO VIII,"Now make intelligent, clearing the doubt"
1248,CANTO VIII,"Thy speech hath raised in me; for much I muse,"
1249,CANTO VIII,"How bitter can spring up, when sweet is sown."""
1250,CANTO VIII,
1251,CANTO VIII,I thus inquiring; he forthwith replied:
1252,CANTO VIII,"""If I have power to show one truth, soon that"
1253,CANTO VIII,"Shall face thee, which thy questioning declares"
1254,CANTO VIII,"Behind thee now conceal'd.  The Good, that guides"
1255,CANTO VIII,"And blessed makes this realm, which thou dost mount,"
1256,CANTO VIII,Ordains its providence to be the virtue
1257,CANTO VIII,In these great bodies: nor th' all perfect Mind
1258,CANTO VIII,"Upholds their nature merely, but in them"
1259,CANTO VIII,"Their energy to save: for nought, that lies"
1260,CANTO VIII,"Within the range of that unerring bow,"
1261,CANTO VIII,"But is as level with the destin'd aim,"
1262,CANTO VIII,As ever mark to arrow's point oppos'd.
1263,CANTO VIII,"Were it not thus, these heavens, thou dost visit,"
1264,CANTO VIII,"Would their effect so work, it would not be"
1265,CANTO VIII,"Art, but destruction; and this may not chance,"
1266,CANTO VIII,"If th' intellectual powers, that move these stars,"
1267,CANTO VIII,"Fail not, or who, first faulty made them fail."
1268,CANTO VIII,"Wilt thou this truth more clearly evidenc'd?"""
1269,CANTO VIII,
1270,CANTO VIII,"To whom I thus: ""It is enough: no fear,"
1271,CANTO VIII,"I see, lest nature in her part should tire."""
1272,CANTO VIII,
1273,CANTO VIII,"He straight rejoin'd: ""Say, were it worse for man,"
1274,CANTO VIII,"If he liv'd not in fellowship on earth?"""
1275,CANTO VIII,
1276,CANTO VIII,"""Yea,"" answer'd I; ""nor here a reason needs."""
1277,CANTO VIII,
1278,CANTO VIII,"""And may that be, if different estates"
1279,CANTO VIII,Grow not of different duties in your life?
1280,CANTO VIII,"Consult your teacher, and he tells you 'no.""'"
1281,CANTO VIII,
1282,CANTO VIII,"Thus did he come, deducing to this point,"
1283,CANTO VIII,"And then concluded: ""For this cause behooves,"
1284,CANTO VIII,"The roots, from whence your operations come,"
1285,CANTO VIII,Must differ.  Therefore one is Solon born;
1286,CANTO VIII,"Another, Xerxes; and Melchisidec"
1287,CANTO VIII,"A third; and he a fourth, whose airy voyage"
1288,CANTO VIII,"Cost him his son.  In her circuitous course,"
1289,CANTO VIII,"Nature, that is the seal to mortal wax,"
1290,CANTO VIII,"Doth well her art, but no distinctions owns"
1291,CANTO VIII,'Twixt one or other household.  Hence befalls
1292,CANTO VIII,That Esau is so wide of Jacob: hence
1293,CANTO VIII,"Quirinus of so base a father springs,"
1294,CANTO VIII,He dates from Mars his lineage.  Were it not
1295,CANTO VIII,"That providence celestial overrul'd,"
1296,CANTO VIII,"Nature, in generation, must the path"
1297,CANTO VIII,"Trac'd by the generator, still pursue"
1298,CANTO VIII,Unswervingly.  Thus place I in thy sight
1299,CANTO VIII,"That, which was late behind thee.  But, in sign"
1300,CANTO VIII,"Of more affection for thee, 't is my will"
1301,CANTO VIII,Thou wear this corollary.  Nature ever
1302,CANTO VIII,"Finding discordant fortune, like all seed"
1303,CANTO VIII,"Out of its proper climate, thrives but ill."
1304,CANTO VIII,And were the world below content to mark
1305,CANTO VIII,"And work on the foundation nature lays,"
1306,CANTO VIII,It would not lack supply of excellence.
1307,CANTO VIII,But ye perversely to religion strain
1308,CANTO VIII,"Him, who was born to gird on him the sword,"
1309,CANTO VIII,And of the fluent phrasemen make your king;
1310,CANTO VIII,"Therefore your steps have wander'd from the paths."""

1325,CANTO IX,"Was to the sun, that fills it, turn'd again,"
1326,CANTO IX,"As to the good, whose plenitude of bliss"
1327,CANTO IX,Sufficeth all.  O ye misguided souls!

1331,CANTO IX,"Another of those splendent forms approach'd,"
1332,CANTO IX,"That, by its outward bright'ning, testified"
1333,CANTO IX,The will it had to pleasure me.  The eyes
1334,CANTO IX,"Of Beatrice, resting, as before,"
1335,CANTO IX,"Firmly upon me, manifested forth"
1336,CANTO IX,"Approval of my wish.  ""And O,"" I cried,"

1344,CANTO IX,"Between Rialto, and the fountain-springs"
1345,CANTO IX,"Of Brenta and of Piava, there doth rise,"
1346,CANTO IX,"But to no lofty eminence, a hill,"
1347,CANTO IX,"From whence erewhile a firebrand did descend,"
1348,CANTO IX,That sorely sheet the region.  From one root

1350,CANTO IX,"And here I glitter, for that by its light"
1351,CANTO IX,"This star o'ercame me.  Yet I naught repine,"
1352,CANTO IX,"Nor grudge myself the cause of this my lot,"
1353,CANTO IX,Which haply vulgar hearts can scarce conceive.

1355,CANTO IX,"""This jewel, that is next me in our heaven,"
1356,CANTO IX,"Lustrous and costly, great renown hath left,"

1358,CANTO IX,"Five times absolve their round.  Consider thou,"
1359,CANTO IX,"If to excel be worthy man's endeavour,"
1360,CANTO IX,When such life may attend the first.  Yet they

1363,CANTO IX,"Impenitent, tho' scourg'd.  The hour is near,"
1364,CANTO IX,When for their stubbornness at Padua's marsh
1365,CANTO IX,"The water shall be chang'd, that laves Vicena"
1366,CANTO IX,"And where Cagnano meets with Sile, one"
1367,CANTO IX,"Lords it, and bears his head aloft, for whom"
1368,CANTO IX,The web is now a-warping.  Feltro too

1370,CANTO IX,"Of so deep stain, that never, for the like,"
1371,CANTO IX,Was Malta's bar unclos'd.  Too large should be

1384,CANTO IX,"A thing to marvel at, in splendour glowing,"
1385,CANTO IX,"Like choicest ruby stricken by the sun,"
1386,CANTO IX,"For, in that upper clime, effulgence comes"
1387,CANTO IX,"Of gladness, as here laughter: and below,"

1394,CANTO IX,"That voice which joins the inexpressive song,"
1395,CANTO IX,"Pastime of heav'n, the which those ardours sing,"

1403,CANTO IX,"Between discordant shores, against the sun"
1404,CANTO IX,"Inward so far, it makes meridian there,"
1405,CANTO IX,Where was before th' horizon.  Of that vale
1406,CANTO IX,"Dwelt I upon the shore, 'twixt Ebro's stream"
1407,CANTO IX,"And Macra's, that divides with passage brief"
1408,CANTO IX,Genoan bounds from Tuscan.  East and west
1409,CANTO IX,"Are nearly one to Begga and my land,"
1410,CANTO IX,Whose haven erst was with its own blood warm.
1411,CANTO IX,Who knew my name were wont to call me Folco:
1412,CANTO IX,"And I did bear impression of this heav'n,"
1413,CANTO IX,That now bears mine: for not with fiercer flame
1414,CANTO IX,"Glow'd Belus' daughter, injuring alike"
1415,CANTO IX,"Sichaeus and Creusa, than did I,"
1416,CANTO IX,Long as it suited the unripen'd down
1417,CANTO IX,"That fledg'd my cheek: nor she of Rhodope,"
1418,CANTO IX,That was beguiled of Demophoon;
1419,CANTO IX,"Nor Jove's son, when the charms of Iole"

1421,CANTO IX,"No sorrowful repentance here, but mirth,"
1422,CANTO IX,"Not for the fault (that doth not come to mind),"
1423,CANTO IX,"But for the virtue, whose o'erruling sway"

1436,CANTO IX,"He to that heav'n, at which the shadow ends"

1562,CANTO X,"He, nearest on my right hand, brother was,"

1571,CANTO X,"The other, nearest, who adorns our quire,"

1577,CANTO X,"With sapience so profound, if truth be truth,"
1578,CANTO X,That with a ken of such wide amplitude
1579,CANTO X,No second hath arisen.  Next behold
1580,CANTO X,"That taper's radiance, to whose view was shown,"
1581,CANTO X,"Clearliest, the nature and the ministry"
1582,CANTO X,"Angelical, while yet in flesh it dwelt."
1583,CANTO X,In the other little light serenely smiles

1594,CANTO X,"Where flames the arduous Spirit of Isidore,"
1595,CANTO X,"Of Bede, and Richard, more than man, erewhile,"
1596,CANTO X,"In deep discernment.  Lastly this, from whom"
1597,CANTO X,"Thy look on me reverteth, was the beam"
1598,CANTO X,"Of one, whose spirit, on high musings bent,"

1601,CANTO X,"Who 'scap'd not envy, when of truth he argued,"
1602,CANTO X,"Reading in the straw-litter'd street.""  Forthwith,"

1604,CANTO X,"To win her bridegroom's love at matin's hour,"
1605,CANTO X,"Each part of other fitly drawn and urg'd,"
1606,CANTO X,"Sends out a tinkling sound, of note so sweet,"

1709,CANTO XI,Whose marvellous life deservedly were sung

1716,CANTO XI,Unripen'd for conversion: back once more

1718,CANTO XI,"And reap'd Ausonian lands.  On the hard rock,"
1719,CANTO XI,"'Twixt Arno and the Tyber, he from Christ"

1926,CANTO XIII,The song fulfill'd its measure; and to us
1927,CANTO XIII,"Those saintly lights attended, happier made"
1928,CANTO XIII,"At each new minist'ring.  Then silence brake,"
1929,CANTO XIII,"Amid th' accordant sons of Deity,"
1930,CANTO XIII,"That luminary, in which the wondrous life"
1931,CANTO XIII,Of the meek man of God was told to me;
1932,CANTO XIII,"And thus it spake: ""One ear o' th' harvest thresh'd,"
1933,CANTO XIII,"And its grain safely stor'd, sweet charity"
1934,CANTO XIII,Invites me with the other to like toil.
1935,CANTO XIII,
1936,CANTO XIII,"""Thou know'st, that in the bosom, whence the rib"
1937,CANTO XIII,"Was ta'en to fashion that fair cheek, whose taste"
1938,CANTO XIII,"All the world pays for, and in that, which pierc'd"
1939,CANTO XIII,"By the keen lance, both after and before"
1940,CANTO XIII,"Such satisfaction offer'd, as outweighs"
1941,CANTO XIII,"Each evil in the scale, whate'er of light"
1942,CANTO XIII,"To human nature is allow'd, must all"
1943,CANTO XIII,"Have by his virtue been infus'd, who form'd"
1944,CANTO XIII,Both one and other: and thou thence admir'st
1945,CANTO XIII,"In that I told thee, of beatitudes"
1946,CANTO XIII,"A second, there is none, to his enclos'd"
1947,CANTO XIII,In the fifth radiance.  Open now thine eyes
1948,CANTO XIII,To what I answer thee; and thou shalt see
1949,CANTO XIII,"Thy deeming and my saying meet in truth,"
1950,CANTO XIII,"As centre in the round.  That which dies not,"
1951,CANTO XIII,"And that which can die, are but each the beam"
1952,CANTO XIII,"Of that idea, which our Soverign Sire"
1953,CANTO XIII,"Engendereth loving; for that lively light,"
1954,CANTO XIII,Which passeth from his brightness; not disjoin'd
1955,CANTO XIII,"From him, nor from his love triune with them,"
1956,CANTO XIII,"Doth, through his bounty, congregate itself,"
1957,CANTO XIII,"Mirror'd, as 't were in new existences,"
1958,CANTO XIII,Itself unalterable and ever one.
1959,CANTO XIII,
1960,CANTO XIII,"""Descending hence unto the lowest powers,"
1961,CANTO XIII,"Its energy so sinks, at last it makes"
1962,CANTO XIII,But brief contingencies: for so I name
1963,CANTO XIII,"Things generated, which the heav'nly orbs"
1964,CANTO XIII,"Moving, with seed or without seed, produce."
1965,CANTO XIII,"Their wax, and that which molds it, differ much:"
1966,CANTO XIII,"And thence with lustre, more or less, it shows"
1967,CANTO XIII,Th' ideal stamp impress: so that one tree
1968,CANTO XIII,"According to his kind, hath better fruit,"
1969,CANTO XIII,"And worse: and, at your birth, ye, mortal men,"
1970,CANTO XIII,Are in your talents various.  Were the wax
1971,CANTO XIII,"Molded with nice exactness, and the heav'n"
1972,CANTO XIII,"In its disposing influence supreme,"
1973,CANTO XIII,The lustre of the seal should be complete:
1974,CANTO XIII,"But nature renders it imperfect ever,"
1975,CANTO XIII,"Resembling thus the artist in her work,"
1976,CANTO XIII,Whose faultering hand is faithless to his skill.
1977,CANTO XIII,"Howe'er, if love itself dispose, and mark"
1978,CANTO XIII,"The primal virtue, kindling with bright view,"
1979,CANTO XIII,There all perfection is vouchsafed; and such
1980,CANTO XIII,"The clay was made, accomplish'd with each gift,"
1981,CANTO XIII,That life can teem with; such the burden fill'd
1982,CANTO XIII,The virgin's bosom: so that I commend
1983,CANTO XIII,"Thy judgment, that the human nature ne'er"
1984,CANTO XIII,"Was or can be, such as in them it was."
1985,CANTO XIII,
1986,CANTO XIII,"""Did I advance no further than this point,"
1987,CANTO XIII,'How then had he no peer?'  thou might'st reply.
1988,CANTO XIII,"But, that what now appears not, may appear"
1989,CANTO XIII,"Right plainly, ponder, who he was, and what"
1990,CANTO XIII,"(When he was bidden 'Ask' ), the motive sway'd"
1991,CANTO XIII,"To his requesting.  I have spoken thus,"
1992,CANTO XIII,"That thou mayst see, he was a king, who ask'd"
1993,CANTO XIII,"For wisdom, to the end he might be king"
1994,CANTO XIII,Sufficient: not the number to search out
1995,CANTO XIII,"Of the celestial movers; or to know,"
1996,CANTO XIII,If necessary with contingent e'er
1997,CANTO XIII,Have made necessity; or whether that
1998,CANTO XIII,"Be granted, that first motion is; or if"
1999,CANTO XIII,"Of the mid circle can, by art, be made"
2000,CANTO XIII,"Triangle with each corner, blunt or sharp."
2001,CANTO XIII,
2002,CANTO XIII,"""Whence, noting that, which I have said, and this,"
2003,CANTO XIII,"Thou kingly prudence and that ken mayst learn,"
2004,CANTO XIII,At which the dart of my intention aims.
2005,CANTO XIII,"And, marking clearly, that I told thee, 'Risen,'"
2006,CANTO XIII,Thou shalt discern it only hath respect
2007,CANTO XIII,"To kings, of whom are many, and the good"
2008,CANTO XIII,Are rare.  With this distinction take my words;
2009,CANTO XIII,And they may well consist with that which thou
2010,CANTO XIII,"Of the first human father dost believe,"
2011,CANTO XIII,And of our well-beloved.  And let this
2012,CANTO XIII,"Henceforth be led unto thy feet, to make"
2013,CANTO XIII,"Thee slow in motion, as a weary man,"
2014,CANTO XIII,Both to the 'yea' and to the 'nay' thou seest not.
2015,CANTO XIII,"For he among the fools is down full low,"
2016,CANTO XIII,"Whose affirmation, or denial, is"
2017,CANTO XIII,"Without distinction, in each case alike"
2018,CANTO XIII,"Since it befalls, that in most instances"
2019,CANTO XIII,Current opinion leads to false: and then
2020,CANTO XIII,Affection bends the judgment to her ply.
2021,CANTO XIII,
2022,CANTO XIII,"""Much more than vainly doth he loose from shore,"
2023,CANTO XIII,"Since he returns not such as he set forth,"
2024,CANTO XIII,Who fishes for the truth and wanteth skill.
2025,CANTO XIII,And open proofs of this unto the world
2026,CANTO XIII,"Have been afforded in Parmenides,"
2027,CANTO XIII,"Melissus, Bryso, and the crowd beside,"
2028,CANTO XIII,"Who journey'd on, and knew not whither: so did"
2029,CANTO XIII,"Sabellius, Arius, and the other fools,"
2030,CANTO XIII,"Who, like to scymitars, reflected back"
2031,CANTO XIII,"The scripture-image, by distortion marr'd."
2032,CANTO XIII,
2033,CANTO XIII,"""Let not the people be too swift to judge,"
2034,CANTO XIII,"As one who reckons on the blades in field,"
2035,CANTO XIII,Or ere the crop be ripe.  For I have seen
2036,CANTO XIII,The thorn frown rudely all the winter long
2037,CANTO XIII,And after bear the rose upon its top;
2038,CANTO XIII,"And bark, that all the way across the sea"
2039,CANTO XIII,"Ran straight and speedy, perish at the last,"
2040,CANTO XIII,"E'en in the haven's mouth seeing one steal,"
2041,CANTO XIII,"Another brine, his offering to the priest,"
2042,CANTO XIII,Let not Dame Birtha and Sir Martin thence
2043,CANTO XIII,Into heav'n's counsels deem that they can pry:
2044,CANTO XIII,"For one of these may rise, the other fall."""

2051,CANTO XIV,"From centre to the circle, and so back"
2052,CANTO XIV,"From circle to the centre, water moves"
2053,CANTO XIV,"In the round chalice, even as the blow"
2054,CANTO XIV,"Impels it, inwardly, or from without."
2055,CANTO XIV,"Such was the image glanc'd into my mind,"
2056,CANTO XIV,As the great spirit of Aquinum ceas'd;
2057,CANTO XIV,And Beatrice after him her words
2058,CANTO XIV,"Resum'd alternate: ""Need there is (tho' yet"
2059,CANTO XIV,"He tells it to you not in words, nor e'en"
2060,CANTO XIV,In thought) that he should fathom to its depth
2061,CANTO XIV,"Another mystery.  Tell him, if the light,"
2062,CANTO XIV,"Wherewith your substance blooms, shall stay with you"
2063,CANTO XIV,"Eternally, as now: and, if it doth,"
2064,CANTO XIV,"How, when ye shall regain your visible forms,"
2065,CANTO XIV,"The sight may without harm endure the change,"
2066,CANTO XIV,"That also tell.""  As those, who in a ring"
2067,CANTO XIV,"Tread the light measure, in their fitful mirth"
2068,CANTO XIV,"Raise loud the voice, and spring with gladder bound;"
2069,CANTO XIV,"Thus, at the hearing of that pious suit,"
2070,CANTO XIV,The saintly circles in their tourneying
2071,CANTO XIV,And wond'rous note attested new delight.
2072,CANTO XIV,
2073,CANTO XIV,"Whoso laments, that we must doff this garb"
2074,CANTO XIV,"Of frail mortality, thenceforth to live"
2075,CANTO XIV,"Immortally above, he hath not seen"
2076,CANTO XIV,"The sweet refreshing, of that heav'nly shower."
2077,CANTO XIV,
2078,CANTO XIV,"Him, who lives ever, and for ever reigns"
2079,CANTO XIV,"In mystic union of the Three in One,"
2080,CANTO XIV,"Unbounded, bounding all, each spirit thrice"
2081,CANTO XIV,"Sang, with such melody, as but to hear"
2082,CANTO XIV,For highest merit were an ample meed.
2083,CANTO XIV,"And from the lesser orb the goodliest light,"
2084,CANTO XIV,"With gentle voice and mild, such as perhaps"
2085,CANTO XIV,"The angel's once to Mary, thus replied:"
2086,CANTO XIV,"""Long as the joy of Paradise shall last,"
2087,CANTO XIV,"Our love shall shine around that raiment, bright,"
2088,CANTO XIV,"As fervent; fervent, as in vision blest;"
2089,CANTO XIV,"And that as far in blessedness exceeding,"
2090,CANTO XIV,As it hath grave beyond its virtue great.
2091,CANTO XIV,"Our shape, regarmented with glorious weeds"
2092,CANTO XIV,"Of saintly flesh, must, being thus entire,"
2093,CANTO XIV,"Show yet more gracious.  Therefore shall increase,"
2094,CANTO XIV,"Whate'er of light, gratuitous, imparts"
2095,CANTO XIV,"The Supreme Good; light, ministering aid,"
2096,CANTO XIV,The better disclose his glory: whence
2097,CANTO XIV,"The vision needs increasing, much increase"
2098,CANTO XIV,"The fervour, which it kindles; and that too"
2099,CANTO XIV,"The ray, that comes from it.  But as the greed"
2100,CANTO XIV,"Which gives out flame, yet it its whiteness shines"
2101,CANTO XIV,"More lively than that, and so preserves"
2102,CANTO XIV,Its proper semblance; thus this circling sphere
2103,CANTO XIV,"Of splendour, shall to view less radiant seem,"
2104,CANTO XIV,"Than shall our fleshly robe, which yonder earth"
2105,CANTO XIV,Now covers.  Nor will such excess of light
2106,CANTO XIV,"O'erpower us, in corporeal organs made"
2107,CANTO XIV,"Firm, and susceptible of all delight."""
2108,CANTO XIV,
2109,CANTO XIV,"So ready and so cordial an ""Amen,"""
2110,CANTO XIV,"Followed from either choir, as plainly spoke"
2111,CANTO XIV,Desire of their dead bodies; yet perchance
2112,CANTO XIV,"Not for themselves, but for their kindred dear,"
2113,CANTO XIV,"Mothers and sires, and those whom best they lov'd,"
2114,CANTO XIV,Ere they were made imperishable flame.
2115,CANTO XIV,
2116,CANTO XIV,And lo! forthwith there rose up round about
2117,CANTO XIV,"A lustre over that already there,"
2118,CANTO XIV,"Of equal clearness, like the brightening up"
2119,CANTO XIV,Of the horizon.  As at an evening hour
2120,CANTO XIV,"Of twilight, new appearances through heav'n"
2121,CANTO XIV,"Peer with faint glimmer, doubtfully descried;"
2122,CANTO XIV,"So there new substances, methought began"
2123,CANTO XIV,To rise in view; and round the other twain
2124,CANTO XIV,"Enwheeling, sweep their ampler circuit wide."
2125,CANTO XIV,
2126,CANTO XIV,O gentle glitter of eternal beam!
2127,CANTO XIV,"With what a such whiteness did it flow,"
2128,CANTO XIV,"O'erpowering vision in me!  But so fair,"
2129,CANTO XIV,"So passing lovely, Beatrice show'd,"
2130,CANTO XIV,"Mind cannot follow it, nor words express"
2131,CANTO XIV,Her infinite sweetness.  Thence mine eyes regain'd
2132,CANTO XIV,"Power to look up, and I beheld myself,"
2133,CANTO XIV,"Sole with my lady, to more lofty bliss"
2134,CANTO XIV,"Translated: for the star, with warmer smile"
2135,CANTO XIV,"Impurpled, well denoted our ascent."
2136,CANTO XIV,
2137,CANTO XIV,"With all the heart, and with that tongue which speaks"
2138,CANTO XIV,"The same in all, an holocaust I made"
2139,CANTO XIV,"To God, befitting the new grace vouchsaf'd."
2140,CANTO XIV,And from my bosom had not yet upsteam'd
2141,CANTO XIV,"The fuming of that incense, when I knew"
2142,CANTO XIV,The rite accepted.  With such mighty sheen
2143,CANTO XIV,"And mantling crimson, in two listed rays"
2144,CANTO XIV,"The splendours shot before me, that I cried,"
2145,CANTO XIV,"""God of Sabaoth! that does prank them thus!"""
2146,CANTO XIV,
2147,CANTO XIV,"As leads the galaxy from pole to pole,"
2148,CANTO XIV,"Distinguish'd into greater lights and less,"
2149,CANTO XIV,"Its pathway, which the wisest fail to spell;"
2150,CANTO XIV,"So thickly studded, in the depth of Mars,"
2151,CANTO XIV,"Those rays describ'd the venerable sign,"
2152,CANTO XIV,That quadrants in the round conjoining frame.
2153,CANTO XIV,Here memory mocks the toil of genius.  Christ
2154,CANTO XIV,Beam'd on that cross; and pattern fails me now.
2155,CANTO XIV,"But whoso takes his cross, and follows Christ"
2156,CANTO XIV,"Will pardon me for that I leave untold,"
2157,CANTO XIV,When in the flecker'd dawning he shall spy
2158,CANTO XIV,"The glitterance of Christ.  From horn to horn,"
2159,CANTO XIV,And 'tween the summit and the base did move
2160,CANTO XIV,"Lights, scintillating, as they met and pass'd."
2161,CANTO XIV,"Thus oft are seen, with ever-changeful glance,"
2162,CANTO XIV,"Straight or athwart, now rapid and now slow,"
2163,CANTO XIV,"The atomies of bodies, long or short,"
2164,CANTO XIV,"To move along the sunbeam, whose slant line"
2165,CANTO XIV,"Checkers the shadow, interpos'd by art"
2166,CANTO XIV,Against the noontide heat.  And as the chime
2167,CANTO XIV,"Of minstrel music, dulcimer, and help"
2168,CANTO XIV,"With many strings, a pleasant dining makes"
2169,CANTO XIV,"To him, who heareth not distinct the note;"
2170,CANTO XIV,"So from the lights, which there appear'd to me,"
2171,CANTO XIV,"Gather'd along the cross a melody,"
2172,CANTO XIV,"That, indistinctly heard, with ravishment"
2173,CANTO XIV,Possess'd me.  Yet I mark'd it was a hymn
2174,CANTO XIV,Of lofty praises; for there came to me
2175,CANTO XIV,"""Arise and conquer,"" as to one who hears"
2176,CANTO XIV,And comprehends not.  Me such ecstasy
2177,CANTO XIV,"O'ercame, that never till that hour was thing"
2178,CANTO XIV,That held me in so sweet imprisonment.
2179,CANTO XIV,
2180,CANTO XIV,"Perhaps my saying over bold appears,"
2181,CANTO XIV,"Accounting less the pleasure of those eyes,"
2182,CANTO XIV,Whereon to look fulfilleth all desire.
2183,CANTO XIV,"But he, who is aware those living seals"
2184,CANTO XIV,"Of every beauty work with quicker force,"
2185,CANTO XIV,The higher they are ris'n; and that there
2186,CANTO XIV,I had not turn'd me to them; he may well
2187,CANTO XIV,"Excuse me that, whereof in my excuse"
2188,CANTO XIV,"I do accuse me, and may own my truth;"
2189,CANTO XIV,"That holy pleasure here not yet reveal'd,"
2190,CANTO XIV,Which grows in transport as we mount aloof.
