45,CANTO XVIII,
46,CANTO XVIII,THERE is a place within the depths of hell
47,CANTO XVIII,"Call'd Malebolge, all of rock dark-stain'd"
48,CANTO XVIII,"With hue ferruginous, e'en as the steep"
49,CANTO XVIII,That round it circling winds.  Right in the midst
50,CANTO XVIII,"Of that abominable region, yawns"
51,CANTO XVIII,"A spacious gulf profound, whereof the frame"
52,CANTO XVIII,"Due time shall tell.  The circle, that remains,"
53,CANTO XVIII,"Throughout its round, between the gulf and base"
54,CANTO XVIII,"Of the high craggy banks, successive forms"
55,CANTO XVIII,"Ten trenches, in its hollow bottom sunk."
56,CANTO XVIII,
57,CANTO XVIII,"As where to guard the walls, full many a foss"
58,CANTO XVIII,"Begirds some stately castle, sure defence"
59,CANTO XVIII,"Affording to the space within, so here"
60,CANTO XVIII,Were model'd these; and as like fortresses
61,CANTO XVIII,"E'en from their threshold to the brink without,"
62,CANTO XVIII,Are flank'd with bridges; from the rock's low base
63,CANTO XVIII,"Thus flinty paths advanc'd, that 'cross the moles"
64,CANTO XVIII,"And dikes, struck onward far as to the gulf,"
65,CANTO XVIII,That in one bound collected cuts them off.
66,CANTO XVIII,"Such was the place, wherein we found ourselves"
67,CANTO XVIII,From Geryon's back dislodg'd. The bard to left
68,CANTO XVIII,"Held on his way, and I behind him mov'd."
69,CANTO XVIII,
70,CANTO XVIII,"On our right hand new misery I saw,"
71,CANTO XVIII,"New pains, new executioners of wrath,"
72,CANTO XVIII,That swarming peopled the first chasm.  Below
73,CANTO XVIII,"Were naked sinners.  Hitherward they came,"
74,CANTO XVIII,"Meeting our faces from the middle point,"
75,CANTO XVIII,With us beyond but with a larger stride.
76,CANTO XVIII,"E'en thus the Romans, when the year returns"
77,CANTO XVIII,"Of Jubilee, with better speed to rid"
78,CANTO XVIII,"The thronging multitudes, their means devise"
79,CANTO XVIII,For such as pass the bridge; that on one side
80,CANTO XVIII,"All front toward the castle, and approach"
81,CANTO XVIII,"Saint Peter's fane, on th' other towards the mount."
82,CANTO XVIII,
83,CANTO XVIII,"Each divers way along the grisly rock,"
84,CANTO XVIII,"Horn'd demons I beheld, with lashes huge,"
85,CANTO XVIII,That on their back unmercifully smote.
86,CANTO XVIII,Ah! how they made them bound at the first stripe!
87,CANTO XVIII,
88,CANTO XVIII,None for the second waited nor the third.
89,CANTO XVIII,
90,CANTO XVIII,"Meantime as on I pass'd, one met my sight"
91,CANTO XVIII,"Whom soon as view'd; ""Of him,"" cried I, ""not yet"
92,CANTO XVIII,"Mine eye hath had his fill.""  With fixed gaze"
93,CANTO XVIII,I therefore scann'd him.  Straight the teacher kind
94,CANTO XVIII,"Paus'd with me, and consented I should walk"
95,CANTO XVIII,"Backward a space, and the tormented spirit,"
96,CANTO XVIII,"Who thought to hide him, bent his visage down."
97,CANTO XVIII,But it avail'd him nought; for I exclaim'd:
98,CANTO XVIII,"""Thou who dost cast thy eye upon the ground,"
99,CANTO XVIII,"Unless thy features do belie thee much,"
100,CANTO XVIII,Venedico art thou.  But what brings thee
101,CANTO XVIII,"Into this bitter seas'ning?"" He replied:"
102,CANTO XVIII,"""Unwillingly I answer to thy words."
103,CANTO XVIII,"But thy clear speech, that to my mind recalls"
104,CANTO XVIII,"The world I once inhabited, constrains me."
105,CANTO XVIII,Know then 'twas I who led fair Ghisola
106,CANTO XVIII,"To do the Marquis' will, however fame"
107,CANTO XVIII,The shameful tale have bruited.  Nor alone
108,CANTO XVIII,Bologna hither sendeth me to mourn
109,CANTO XVIII,Rather with us the place is so o'erthrong'd
110,CANTO XVIII,"That not so many tongues this day are taught,"
111,CANTO XVIII,"Betwixt the Reno and Savena's stream,"
112,CANTO XVIII,To answer SIPA in their country's phrase.
113,CANTO XVIII,"And if of that securer proof thou need,"
114,CANTO XVIII,"Remember but our craving thirst for gold."""
115,CANTO XVIII,
116,CANTO XVIII,"Him speaking thus, a demon with his thong"
117,CANTO XVIII,"Struck, and exclaim'd, ""Away! corrupter! here"
118,CANTO XVIII,"Women are none for sale.""  Forthwith I join'd"
119,CANTO XVIII,"My escort, and few paces thence we came"
120,CANTO XVIII,To where a rock forth issued from the bank.
121,CANTO XVIII,"That easily ascended, to the right"
122,CANTO XVIII,"Upon its splinter turning, we depart"
123,CANTO XVIII,"From those eternal barriers. When arriv'd,"
124,CANTO XVIII,Where underneath the gaping arch lets pass
125,CANTO XVIII,"The scourged souls: ""Pause here,"" the teacher said,"
126,CANTO XVIII,"""And let these others miserable, now"
127,CANTO XVIII,"Strike on thy ken, faces not yet beheld,"
128,CANTO XVIII,"For that together they with us have walk'd."""
129,CANTO XVIII,
130,CANTO XVIII,"From the old bridge we ey'd the pack, who came"
131,CANTO XVIII,"From th' other side towards us, like the rest,"
132,CANTO XVIII,"Excoriate from the lash.  My gentle guide,"
133,CANTO XVIII,"By me unquestion'd, thus his speech resum'd:"
134,CANTO XVIII,"""Behold that lofty shade, who this way tends,"
135,CANTO XVIII,And seems too woe-begone to drop a tear.
136,CANTO XVIII,How yet the regal aspect he retains!
137,CANTO XVIII,"Jason is he, whose skill and prowess won"
138,CANTO XVIII,The ram from Colchos. To the Lemnian isle
139,CANTO XVIII,"His passage thither led him, when those bold"
140,CANTO XVIII,And pitiless women had slain all their males.
141,CANTO XVIII,There he with tokens and fair witching words
142,CANTO XVIII,"Hypsipyle beguil'd, a virgin young,"
143,CANTO XVIII,Who first had all the rest herself beguil'd.
144,CANTO XVIII,Impregnated he left her there forlorn.
145,CANTO XVIII,Such is the guilt condemns him to this pain.
146,CANTO XVIII,Here too Medea's inj'ries are avenged.
147,CANTO XVIII,"All bear him company, who like deceit"
148,CANTO XVIII,To his have practis'd.  And thus much to know
149,CANTO XVIII,"Of the first vale suffice thee, and of those"
150,CANTO XVIII,"Whom its keen torments urge.""  Now had we come"
151,CANTO XVIII,"Where, crossing the next pier, the straighten'd path"
152,CANTO XVIII,Bestrides its shoulders to another arch.
153,CANTO XVIII,
154,CANTO XVIII,"Hence in the second chasm we heard the ghosts,"
155,CANTO XVIII,"Who jibber in low melancholy sounds,"
156,CANTO XVIII,"With wide-stretch'd nostrils snort, and on themselves"
157,CANTO XVIII,Smite with their palms.  Upon the banks a scurf
158,CANTO XVIII,"From the foul steam condens'd, encrusting hung,"
159,CANTO XVIII,That held sharp combat with the sight and smell.
160,CANTO XVIII,
161,CANTO XVIII,"So hollow is the depth, that from no part,"
162,CANTO XVIII,"Save on the summit of the rocky span,"
163,CANTO XVIII,Could I distinguish aught.  Thus far we came;
164,CANTO XVIII,"And thence I saw, within the foss below,"
165,CANTO XVIII,"A crowd immers'd in ordure, that appear'd"
166,CANTO XVIII,Draff of the human body.  There beneath
167,CANTO XVIII,"Searching with eye inquisitive, I mark'd"
168,CANTO XVIII,"One with his head so grim'd, 't were hard to deem,"
169,CANTO XVIII,If he were clerk or layman.  Loud he cried:
170,CANTO XVIII,"""Why greedily thus bendest more on me,"
171,CANTO XVIII,"Than on these other filthy ones, thy ken?"""
172,CANTO XVIII,
173,CANTO XVIII,"""Because if true my mem'ry,"" I replied,"
174,CANTO XVIII,"""I heretofore have seen thee with dry locks,"
175,CANTO XVIII,And thou Alessio art of Lucca sprung.
176,CANTO XVIII,"Therefore than all the rest I scan thee more."""
177,CANTO XVIII,
178,CANTO XVIII,Then beating on his brain these words he spake:
179,CANTO XVIII,"""Me thus low down my flatteries have sunk,"
180,CANTO XVIII,"Wherewith I ne'er enough could glut my tongue."""
181,CANTO XVIII,
182,CANTO XVIII,"My leader thus: ""A little further stretch"
183,CANTO XVIII,"Thy face, that thou the visage well mayst note"
184,CANTO XVIII,"Of that besotted, sluttish courtezan,"
185,CANTO XVIII,"Who there doth rend her with defiled nails,"
186,CANTO XVIII,"Now crouching down, now risen on her feet."
187,CANTO XVIII,
188,CANTO XVIII,"""Thais is this, the harlot, whose false lip"
189,CANTO XVIII,"Answer'd her doting paramour that ask'd,"
190,CANTO XVIII,"'Thankest me much!'--'Say rather wondrously,'"
191,CANTO XVIII,"And seeing this here satiate be our view."""
192,CANTO XVIII,
193,CANTO XVIII,
194,CANTO XVIII,
195,CANTO XVIII,
196,CANTO XIX,CANTO XIX
197,CANTO XIX,
198,CANTO XIX,"WOE to thee, Simon Magus! woe to you,"
199,CANTO XIX,"His wretched followers! who the things of God,"
200,CANTO XIX,"Which should be wedded unto goodness, them,"
201,CANTO XIX,"Rapacious as ye are, do prostitute"
202,CANTO XIX,For gold and silver in adultery!
203,CANTO XIX,"Now must the trumpet sound for you, since yours"
204,CANTO XIX,Is the third chasm.  Upon the following vault
205,CANTO XIX,"We now had mounted, where the rock impends"
206,CANTO XIX,Directly o'er the centre of the foss.
207,CANTO XIX,
208,CANTO XIX,"Wisdom Supreme! how wonderful the art,"
209,CANTO XIX,"Which thou dost manifest in heaven, in earth,"
210,CANTO XIX,"And in the evil world, how just a meed"
211,CANTO XIX,Allotting by thy virtue unto all!
212,CANTO XIX,
213,CANTO XIX,"I saw the livid stone, throughout the sides"
214,CANTO XIX,"And in its bottom full of apertures,"
215,CANTO XIX,"All equal in their width, and circular each,"
216,CANTO XIX,Nor ample less nor larger they appear'd
217,CANTO XIX,Than in Saint John's fair dome of me belov'd
218,CANTO XIX,"Those fram'd to hold the pure baptismal streams,"
219,CANTO XIX,"One of the which I brake, some few years past,"
220,CANTO XIX,To save a whelming infant; and be this
221,CANTO XIX,A seal to undeceive whoever doubts
222,CANTO XIX,The motive of my deed.  From out the mouth
223,CANTO XIX,"Of every one, emerg'd a sinner's feet"
224,CANTO XIX,And of the legs high upward as the calf
225,CANTO XIX,The rest beneath was hid.  On either foot
226,CANTO XIX,"The soles were burning, whence the flexile joints"
227,CANTO XIX,"Glanc'd with such violent motion, as had snapt"
228,CANTO XIX,"Asunder cords or twisted withs.  As flame,"
229,CANTO XIX,"Feeding on unctuous matter, glides along"
230,CANTO XIX,"The surface, scarcely touching where it moves;"
231,CANTO XIX,"So here, from heel to point, glided the flames."
232,CANTO XIX,
233,CANTO XIX,"""Master! say who is he, than all the rest"
234,CANTO XIX,"Glancing in fiercer agony, on whom"
235,CANTO XIX,"A ruddier flame doth prey?""  I thus inquir'd."
236,CANTO XIX,
237,CANTO XIX,"""If thou be willing,"" he replied, ""that I"
238,CANTO XIX,"Carry thee down, where least the slope bank falls,"
239,CANTO XIX,"He of himself shall tell thee and his wrongs."""
240,CANTO XIX,
241,CANTO XIX,"I then: ""As pleases thee to me is best."
242,CANTO XIX,Thou art my lord; and know'st that ne'er I quit
243,CANTO XIX,"Thy will: what silence hides that knowest thou."""
244,CANTO XIX,"Thereat on the fourth pier we came, we turn'd,"
245,CANTO XIX,"And on our left descended to the depth,"
246,CANTO XIX,A narrow strait and perforated close.
247,CANTO XIX,"Nor from his side my leader set me down,"
248,CANTO XIX,"Till to his orifice he brought, whose limb"
249,CANTO XIX,"Quiv'ring express'd his pang.  ""Whoe'er thou art,"
250,CANTO XIX,"Sad spirit! thus revers'd, and as a stake"
251,CANTO XIX,"Driv'n in the soil!""  I in these words began,"
252,CANTO XIX,"""If thou be able, utter forth thy voice."""
253,CANTO XIX,
254,CANTO XIX,"There stood I like the friar, that doth shrive"
255,CANTO XIX,"A wretch for murder doom'd, who e'en when fix'd,"
256,CANTO XIX,"Calleth him back, whence death awhile delays."
257,CANTO XIX,
258,CANTO XIX,"He shouted: ""Ha! already standest there?"
259,CANTO XIX,"Already standest there, O Boniface!"
260,CANTO XIX,By many a year the writing play'd me false.
261,CANTO XIX,"So early dost thou surfeit with the wealth,"
262,CANTO XIX,For which thou fearedst not in guile to take
263,CANTO XIX,"The lovely lady, and then mangle her?"""
264,CANTO XIX,
265,CANTO XIX,"I felt as those who, piercing not the drift"
266,CANTO XIX,"Of answer made them, stand as if expos'd"
267,CANTO XIX,"In mockery, nor know what to reply,"
268,CANTO XIX,"When Virgil thus admonish'd: ""Tell him quick,"
269,CANTO XIX,"I am not he, not he, whom thou believ'st."""
270,CANTO XIX,
271,CANTO XIX,"And I, as was enjoin'd me, straight replied."
272,CANTO XIX,
273,CANTO XIX,"That heard, the spirit all did wrench his feet,"
274,CANTO XIX,And sighing next in woeful accent spake:
275,CANTO XIX,"""What then of me requirest?  If to know"
276,CANTO XIX,"So much imports thee, who I am, that thou"
277,CANTO XIX,"Hast therefore down the bank descended, learn"
278,CANTO XIX,"That in the mighty mantle I was rob'd,"
279,CANTO XIX,"And of a she-bear was indeed the son,"
280,CANTO XIX,"So eager to advance my whelps, that there"
281,CANTO XIX,"My having in my purse above I stow'd,"
282,CANTO XIX,And here myself.  Under my head are dragg'd
283,CANTO XIX,"The rest, my predecessors in the guilt"
284,CANTO XIX,Of simony.  Stretch'd at their length they lie
285,CANTO XIX,Along an opening in the rock.  'Midst them
286,CANTO XIX,"I also low shall fall, soon as he comes,"
287,CANTO XIX,"For whom I took thee, when so hastily"
288,CANTO XIX,I question'd.  But already longer time
289,CANTO XIX,"Hath pass'd, since my souls kindled, and I thus"
290,CANTO XIX,"Upturn'd have stood, than is his doom to stand"
291,CANTO XIX,"Planted with fiery feet.  For after him,"
292,CANTO XIX,"One yet of deeds more ugly shall arrive,"
293,CANTO XIX,"From forth the west, a shepherd without law,"
294,CANTO XIX,Fated to cover both his form and mine.
295,CANTO XIX,"He a new Jason shall be call'd, of whom"
296,CANTO XIX,In Maccabees we read; and favour such
297,CANTO XIX,"As to that priest his king indulgent show'd,"
298,CANTO XIX,"Shall be of France's monarch shown to him."""
299,CANTO XIX,
300,CANTO XIX,"I know not if I here too far presum'd,"
301,CANTO XIX,"But in this strain I answer'd: ""Tell me now,"
302,CANTO XIX,What treasures from St. Peter at the first
303,CANTO XIX,"Our Lord demanded, when he put the keys"
304,CANTO XIX,Into his charge?  Surely he ask'd no more
305,CANTO XIX,"But, Follow me!  Nor Peter nor the rest"
306,CANTO XIX,"Or gold or silver of Matthias took,"
307,CANTO XIX,When lots were cast upon the forfeit place
308,CANTO XIX,Of the condemned soul.  Abide thou then;
309,CANTO XIX,Thy punishment of right is merited:
310,CANTO XIX,"And look thou well to that ill-gotten coin,"
311,CANTO XIX,Which against Charles thy hardihood inspir'd.
312,CANTO XIX,"If reverence of the keys restrain'd me not,"
313,CANTO XIX,"Which thou in happier time didst hold, I yet"
314,CANTO XIX,Severer speech might use.  Your avarice
315,CANTO XIX,"O'ercasts the world with mourning, under foot"
316,CANTO XIX,"Treading the good, and raising bad men up."
317,CANTO XIX,"Of shepherds, like to you, th' Evangelist"
318,CANTO XIX,"Was ware, when her, who sits upon the waves,"
319,CANTO XIX,"With kings in filthy whoredom he beheld,"
320,CANTO XIX,"She who with seven heads tower'd at her birth,"
321,CANTO XIX,"And from ten horns her proof of glory drew,"
322,CANTO XIX,Long as her spouse in virtue took delight.
323,CANTO XIX,"Of gold and silver ye have made your god,"
324,CANTO XIX,"Diff'ring wherein from the idolater,"
325,CANTO XIX,"But he that worships one, a hundred ye?"
326,CANTO XIX,"Ah, Constantine! to how much ill gave birth,"
327,CANTO XIX,"Not thy conversion, but that plenteous dower,"
328,CANTO XIX,"Which the first wealthy Father gain'd from thee!"""
329,CANTO XIX,
330,CANTO XIX,"Meanwhile, as thus I sung, he, whether wrath"
331,CANTO XIX,"Or conscience smote him, violent upsprang"
332,CANTO XIX,Spinning on either sole.  I do believe
333,CANTO XIX,"My teacher well was pleas'd, with so compos'd"
334,CANTO XIX,"A lip, he listen'd ever to the sound"
335,CANTO XIX,Of the true words I utter'd.  In both arms
336,CANTO XIX,"He caught, and to his bosom lifting me"
337,CANTO XIX,Upward retrac'd the way of his descent.
338,CANTO XIX,
339,CANTO XIX,"Nor weary of his weight he press'd me close,"
340,CANTO XIX,"Till to the summit of the rock we came,"
341,CANTO XIX,Our passage from the fourth to the fifth pier.
342,CANTO XIX,His cherish'd burden there gently he plac'd
343,CANTO XIX,"Upon the rugged rock and steep, a path"
344,CANTO XIX,Not easy for the clamb'ring goat to mount.
345,CANTO XIX,
346,CANTO XIX,Thence to my view another vale appear'd
347,CANTO XIX,
348,CANTO XIX,
349,CANTO XIX,
350,CANTO XIX,
351,CANTO XX,CANTO XX
352,CANTO XX,
353,CANTO XX,"AND now the verse proceeds to torments new,"
354,CANTO XX,Fit argument of this the twentieth strain
355,CANTO XX,"Of the first song, whose awful theme records"
356,CANTO XX,The spirits whelm'd in woe.  Earnest I look'd
357,CANTO XX,"Into the depth, that open'd to my view,"
358,CANTO XX,"Moisten'd with tears of anguish, and beheld"
359,CANTO XX,"A tribe, that came along the hollow vale,"
360,CANTO XX,In silence weeping: such their step as walk
361,CANTO XX,Quires chanting solemn litanies on earth.
362,CANTO XX,
363,CANTO XX,"As on them more direct mine eye descends,"
364,CANTO XX,Each wondrously seem'd to be revers'd
365,CANTO XX,"At the neck-bone, so that the countenance"
366,CANTO XX,Was from the reins averted: and because
367,CANTO XX,"None might before him look, they were compell'd"
368,CANTO XX,To' advance with backward gait.  Thus one perhaps
369,CANTO XX,"Hath been by force of palsy clean transpos'd,"
370,CANTO XX,But I ne'er saw it nor believe it so.
371,CANTO XX,
372,CANTO XX,"Now, reader! think within thyself, so God"
373,CANTO XX,Fruit of thy reading give thee! how I long
374,CANTO XX,"Could keep my visage dry, when I beheld"
375,CANTO XX,"Near me our form distorted in such guise,"
376,CANTO XX,That on the hinder parts fall'n from the face
377,CANTO XX,The tears down-streaming roll'd.  Against a rock
378,CANTO XX,"I leant and wept, so that my guide exclaim'd:"
379,CANTO XX,"""What, and art thou too witless as the rest?"
380,CANTO XX,"Here pity most doth show herself alive,"
381,CANTO XX,"When she is dead.  What guilt exceedeth his,"
382,CANTO XX,Who with Heaven's judgment in his passion strives?
383,CANTO XX,"Raise up thy head, raise up, and see the man,"
384,CANTO XX,"Before whose eyes earth gap'd in Thebes, when all"
385,CANTO XX,"Cried out, 'Amphiaraus, whither rushest?"
386,CANTO XX,'Why leavest thou the war?'  He not the less
387,CANTO XX,"Fell ruining far as to Minos down,"
388,CANTO XX,Whose grapple none eludes.  Lo! how he makes
389,CANTO XX,"The breast his shoulders, and who once too far"
390,CANTO XX,"Before him wish'd to see, now backward looks,"
391,CANTO XX,"And treads reverse his path.  Tiresias note,"
392,CANTO XX,"Who semblance chang'd, when woman he became"
393,CANTO XX,"Of male, through every limb transform'd, and then"
394,CANTO XX,Once more behov'd him with his rod to strike
395,CANTO XX,"The two entwining serpents, ere the plumes,"
396,CANTO XX,"That mark'd the better sex, might shoot again."
397,CANTO XX,
398,CANTO XX,"""Aruns, with more his belly facing, comes."
399,CANTO XX,"On Luni's mountains 'midst the marbles white,"
400,CANTO XX,"Where delves Carrara's hind, who wons beneath,"
401,CANTO XX,"A cavern was his dwelling, whence the stars"
402,CANTO XX,And main-sea wide in boundless view he held.
403,CANTO XX,
404,CANTO XX,"""The next, whose loosen'd tresses overspread"
405,CANTO XX,"Her bosom, which thou seest not (for each hair"
406,CANTO XX,"On that side grows) was Manto, she who search'd"
407,CANTO XX,"Through many regions, and at length her seat"
408,CANTO XX,"Fix'd in my native land, whence a short space"
409,CANTO XX,My words detain thy audience.  When her sire
410,CANTO XX,"From life departed, and in servitude"
411,CANTO XX,"The city dedicate to Bacchus mourn'd,"

801,CANTO XXII,"In Calcabrina fury stirr'd, who flew"
802,CANTO XXII,"After him, with desire of strife inflam'd;"
803,CANTO XXII,"And, for the barterer had 'scap'd, so turn'd"
804,CANTO XXII,His talons on his comrade. O'er the dyke
805,CANTO XXII,In grapple close they join'd; but the' other prov'd
806,CANTO XXII,A goshawk able to rend well his foe;
807,CANTO XXII,
808,CANTO XXII,And in the boiling lake both fell.  The heat
809,CANTO XXII,"Was umpire soon between them, but in vain"
810,CANTO XXII,"To lift themselves they strove, so fast were glued"
811,CANTO XXII,"Their pennons.  Barbariccia, as the rest,"
812,CANTO XXII,"That chance lamenting, four in flight dispatch'd"
813,CANTO XXII,"From the' other coast, with all their weapons arm'd."
814,CANTO XXII,"They, to their post on each side speedily"
815,CANTO XXII,"Descending, stretch'd their hooks toward the fiends,"
816,CANTO XXII,"Who flounder'd, inly burning from their scars:"
817,CANTO XXII,And we departing left them to that broil.

857,CANTO XXIII,
858,CANTO XXIII,"IN silence and in solitude we went,"
859,CANTO XXIII,"One first, the other following his steps,"
860,CANTO XXIII,As minor friars journeying on their road.
861,CANTO XXIII,
862,CANTO XXIII,The present fray had turn'd my thoughts to muse
863,CANTO XXIII,"Upon old Aesop's fable, where he told"
864,CANTO XXIII,What fate unto the mouse and frog befell.
865,CANTO XXIII,"For language hath not sounds more like in sense,"
866,CANTO XXIII,"Than are these chances, if the origin"
867,CANTO XXIII,And end of each be heedfully compar'd.
868,CANTO XXIII,"And as one thought bursts from another forth,"
869,CANTO XXIII,"So afterward from that another sprang,"
870,CANTO XXIII,Which added doubly to my former fear.
871,CANTO XXIII,"For thus I reason'd: ""These through us have been"
872,CANTO XXIII,"So foil'd, with loss and mock'ry so complete,"
873,CANTO XXIII,As needs must sting them sore.  If anger then
874,CANTO XXIII,"Be to their evil will conjoin'd, more fell"
875,CANTO XXIII,"They shall pursue us, than the savage hound"
876,CANTO XXIII,"Snatches the leveret, panting 'twixt his jaws."""
877,CANTO XXIII,
878,CANTO XXIII,Already I perceiv'd my hair stand all
879,CANTO XXIII,"On end with terror, and look'd eager back."
880,CANTO XXIII,
881,CANTO XXIII,"""Teacher,"" I thus began, ""if speedily"
882,CANTO XXIII,"Thyself and me thou hide not, much I dread"
883,CANTO XXIII,Those evil talons.  Even now behind
884,CANTO XXIII,They urge us: quick imagination works
885,CANTO XXIII,"So forcibly, that I already feel them."""
886,CANTO XXIII,
887,CANTO XXIII,"He answer'd: ""Were I form'd of leaded glass,"
888,CANTO XXIII,I should not sooner draw unto myself
889,CANTO XXIII,"Thy outward image, than I now imprint"
890,CANTO XXIII,That from within.  This moment came thy thoughts
891,CANTO XXIII,"Presented before mine, with similar act"
892,CANTO XXIII,"And count'nance similar, so that from both"
893,CANTO XXIII,I one design have fram'd.  If the right coast
894,CANTO XXIII,"Incline so much, that we may thence descend"
895,CANTO XXIII,"Into the other chasm, we shall escape"
896,CANTO XXIII,"Secure from this imagined pursuit."""
897,CANTO XXIII,
898,CANTO XXIII,"He had not spoke his purpose to the end,"
899,CANTO XXIII,When I from far beheld them with spread wings
900,CANTO XXIII,Approach to take us.  Suddenly my guide
901,CANTO XXIII,"Caught me, ev'n as a mother that from sleep"
902,CANTO XXIII,"Is by the noise arous'd, and near her sees"
903,CANTO XXIII,"The climbing fires, who snatches up her babe"
904,CANTO XXIII,"And flies ne'er pausing, careful more of him"
905,CANTO XXIII,"Than of herself, that but a single vest"
906,CANTO XXIII,Clings round her limbs.  Down from the jutting beach
907,CANTO XXIII,"Supine he cast him, to that pendent rock,"
908,CANTO XXIII,Which closes on one part the other chasm.
909,CANTO XXIII,
910,CANTO XXIII,Never ran water with such hurrying pace
911,CANTO XXIII,"Adown the tube to turn a landmill's wheel,"
912,CANTO XXIII,"When nearest it approaches to the spokes,"
913,CANTO XXIII,"As then along that edge my master ran,"
914,CANTO XXIII,"Carrying me in his bosom, as a child,"
915,CANTO XXIII,Not a companion.  Scarcely had his feet
916,CANTO XXIII,"Reach'd to the lowest of the bed beneath,"
917,CANTO XXIII,
918,CANTO XXIII,When over us the steep they reach'd; but fear
919,CANTO XXIII,"In him was none; for that high Providence,"
920,CANTO XXIII,"Which plac'd them ministers of the fifth foss,"
921,CANTO XXIII,Power of departing thence took from them all.
922,CANTO XXIII,
923,CANTO XXIII,"There in the depth we saw a painted tribe,"
924,CANTO XXIII,"Who pac'd with tardy steps around, and wept,"
925,CANTO XXIII,Faint in appearance and o'ercome with toil.
926,CANTO XXIII,"Caps had they on, with hoods, that fell low down"
927,CANTO XXIII,"Before their eyes, in fashion like to those"
928,CANTO XXIII,Worn by the monks in Cologne.  Their outside
929,CANTO XXIII,"Was overlaid with gold, dazzling to view,"
930,CANTO XXIII,"But leaden all within, and of such weight,"
931,CANTO XXIII,That Frederick's compar'd to these were straw.
932,CANTO XXIII,"Oh, everlasting wearisome attire!"
933,CANTO XXIII,
934,CANTO XXIII,We yet once more with them together turn'd
935,CANTO XXIII,"To leftward, on their dismal moan intent."
936,CANTO XXIII,"But by the weight oppress'd, so slowly came"
937,CANTO XXIII,"The fainting people, that our company"
938,CANTO XXIII,Was chang'd at every movement of the step.
939,CANTO XXIII,
940,CANTO XXIII,"Whence I my guide address'd: ""See that thou find"
941,CANTO XXIII,"Some spirit, whose name may by his deeds be known,"
942,CANTO XXIII,"And to that end look round thee as thou go'st."""
943,CANTO XXIII,
944,CANTO XXIII,"Then one, who understood the Tuscan voice,"
945,CANTO XXIII,"Cried after us aloud: ""Hold in your feet,"
946,CANTO XXIII,Ye who so swiftly speed through the dusk air.
947,CANTO XXIII,"Perchance from me thou shalt obtain thy wish."""
948,CANTO XXIII,
949,CANTO XXIII,"Whereat my leader, turning, me bespake:"
950,CANTO XXIII,"""Pause, and then onward at their pace proceed."""
951,CANTO XXIII,
952,CANTO XXIII,"I staid, and saw two Spirits in whose look"
953,CANTO XXIII,Impatient eagerness of mind was mark'd
954,CANTO XXIII,To overtake me; but the load they bare
955,CANTO XXIII,And narrow path retarded their approach.
956,CANTO XXIII,
957,CANTO XXIII,"Soon as arriv'd, they with an eye askance"
958,CANTO XXIII,"Perus'd me, but spake not: then turning each"
959,CANTO XXIII,"To other thus conferring said: ""This one"
960,CANTO XXIII,"Seems, by the action of his throat, alive."
961,CANTO XXIII,"And, be they dead, what privilege allows"
962,CANTO XXIII,"They walk unmantled by the cumbrous stole?"""
963,CANTO XXIII,
964,CANTO XXIII,"Then thus to me: ""Tuscan, who visitest"
965,CANTO XXIII,"The college of the mourning hypocrites,"
966,CANTO XXIII,"Disdain not to instruct us who thou art."""
967,CANTO XXIII,
968,CANTO XXIII,"""By Arno's pleasant stream,"" I thus replied,"
969,CANTO XXIII,"""In the great city I was bred and grew,"
970,CANTO XXIII,And wear the body I have ever worn.
971,CANTO XXIII,"but who are ye, from whom such mighty grief,"
972,CANTO XXIII,"As now I witness, courseth down your cheeks?"
973,CANTO XXIII,"What torment breaks forth in this bitter woe?"""
974,CANTO XXIII,"""Our bonnets gleaming bright with orange hue,"""
975,CANTO XXIII,"One of them answer'd, ""are so leaden gross,"
976,CANTO XXIII,That with their weight they make the balances
977,CANTO XXIII,"To crack beneath them.  Joyous friars we were,"
978,CANTO XXIII,"Bologna's natives, Catalano I,"
979,CANTO XXIII,"He Loderingo nam'd, and by thy land"
980,CANTO XXIII,"Together taken, as men used to take"
981,CANTO XXIII,"A single and indifferent arbiter,"
982,CANTO XXIII,"To reconcile their strifes.  How there we sped,"
983,CANTO XXIII,"Gardingo's vicinage can best declare."""
984,CANTO XXIII,
985,CANTO XXIII,"""O friars!""  I began, ""your miseries--"""
986,CANTO XXIII,"But there brake off, for one had caught my eye,"
987,CANTO XXIII,Fix'd to a cross with three stakes on the ground:
988,CANTO XXIII,"He, when he saw me, writh'd himself, throughout"
989,CANTO XXIII,"Distorted, ruffling with deep sighs his beard."
990,CANTO XXIII,"And Catalano, who thereof was 'ware,"
991,CANTO XXIII,
992,CANTO XXIII,"Thus spake: ""That pierced spirit, whom intent"
993,CANTO XXIII,"Thou view'st, was he who gave the Pharisees"
994,CANTO XXIII,"Counsel, that it were fitting for one man"
995,CANTO XXIII,To suffer for the people.  He doth lie
996,CANTO XXIII,"Transverse; nor any passes, but him first"
997,CANTO XXIII,Behoves make feeling trial how each weighs.
998,CANTO XXIII,In straits like this along the foss are plac'd
999,CANTO XXIII,"The father of his consort, and the rest"
1000,CANTO XXIII,"Partakers in that council, seed of ill"
1001,CANTO XXIII,"And sorrow to the Jews.""  I noted then,"
1002,CANTO XXIII,"How Virgil gaz'd with wonder upon him,"
1003,CANTO XXIII,Thus abjectly extended on the cross
1004,CANTO XXIII,In banishment eternal.  To the friar
1005,CANTO XXIII,"He next his words address'd: ""We pray ye tell,"
1006,CANTO XXIII,"If so be lawful, whether on our right"
1007,CANTO XXIII,"Lies any opening in the rock, whereby"
1008,CANTO XXIII,"We both may issue hence, without constraint"
1009,CANTO XXIII,"On the dark angels, that compell'd they come"
1010,CANTO XXIII,"To lead us from this depth.""  He thus replied:"
1011,CANTO XXIII,"""Nearer than thou dost hope, there is a rock"
1012,CANTO XXIII,"From the next circle moving, which o'ersteps"
1013,CANTO XXIII,"Each vale of horror, save that here his cope"
1014,CANTO XXIII,Is shatter'd.  By the ruin ye may mount:
1015,CANTO XXIII,"For on the side it slants, and most the height"
1016,CANTO XXIII,"Rises below.""  With head bent down awhile"
1017,CANTO XXIII,"My leader stood, then spake: ""He warn'd us ill,"
1018,CANTO XXIII,"Who yonder hangs the sinners on his hook."""
1019,CANTO XXIII,
1020,CANTO XXIII,To whom the friar: At Bologna erst
1021,CANTO XXIII,"""I many vices of the devil heard,"
1022,CANTO XXIII,"Among the rest was said, 'He is a liar,"
1023,CANTO XXIII,"And the father of lies!'""  When he had spoke,"
1024,CANTO XXIII,"My leader with large strides proceeded on,"
1025,CANTO XXIII,Somewhat disturb'd with anger in his look.
1026,CANTO XXIII,
1027,CANTO XXIII,"I therefore left the spirits heavy laden,"
1028,CANTO XXIII,"And following, his beloved footsteps mark'd."
1029,CANTO XXIII,

1033,CANTO XXIV,CANTO XXIV
1034,CANTO XXIV,
1035,CANTO XXIV,"IN the year's early nonage, when the sun"
1036,CANTO XXIV,"Tempers his tresses in Aquarius' urn,"
1037,CANTO XXIV,"And now towards equal day the nights recede,"
1038,CANTO XXIV,When as the rime upon the earth puts on
1039,CANTO XXIV,"Her dazzling sister's image, but not long"
1040,CANTO XXIV,"Her milder sway endures, then riseth up"
1041,CANTO XXIV,"The village hind, whom fails his wintry store,"
1042,CANTO XXIV,And looking out beholds the plain around
1043,CANTO XXIV,"All whiten'd, whence impatiently he smites"
1044,CANTO XXIV,"His thighs, and to his hut returning in,"
1045,CANTO XXIV,"There paces to and fro, wailing his lot,"
1046,CANTO XXIV,As a discomfited and helpless man;
1047,CANTO XXIV,"Then comes he forth again, and feels new hope"
1048,CANTO XXIV,"Spring in his bosom, finding e'en thus soon"
1049,CANTO XXIV,"The world hath chang'd its count'nance, grasps his crook,"
1050,CANTO XXIV,And forth to pasture drives his little flock:
1051,CANTO XXIV,So me my guide dishearten'd when I saw
1052,CANTO XXIV,"His troubled forehead, and so speedily"
1053,CANTO XXIV,That ill was cur'd; for at the fallen bridge
1054,CANTO XXIV,"Arriving, towards me with a look as sweet,"
1055,CANTO XXIV,"He turn'd him back, as that I first beheld"
1056,CANTO XXIV,At the steep mountain's foot.  Regarding well
1057,CANTO XXIV,"The ruin, and some counsel first maintain'd"
1058,CANTO XXIV,"With his own thought, he open'd wide his arm"
1059,CANTO XXIV,"And took me up.  As one, who, while he works,"
1060,CANTO XXIV,"Computes his labour's issue, that he seems"
1061,CANTO XXIV,"Still to foresee the' effect, so lifting me"
1062,CANTO XXIV,"Up to the summit of one peak, he fix'd"
1063,CANTO XXIV,"His eye upon another.  ""Grapple that,"""
1064,CANTO XXIV,"Said he, ""but first make proof, if it be such"
1065,CANTO XXIV,"As will sustain thee.""  For one capp'd with lead"
1066,CANTO XXIV,"This were no journey.  Scarcely he, though light,"
1067,CANTO XXIV,"And I, though onward push'd from crag to crag,"
1068,CANTO XXIV,Could mount.  And if the precinct of this coast
1069,CANTO XXIV,"Were not less ample than the last, for him"
1070,CANTO XXIV,"I know not, but my strength had surely fail'd."
1071,CANTO XXIV,But Malebolge all toward the mouth
1072,CANTO XXIV,"Inclining of the nethermost abyss,"
1073,CANTO XXIV,"The site of every valley hence requires,"
1074,CANTO XXIV,"That one side upward slope, the other fall."
1075,CANTO XXIV,
1076,CANTO XXIV,At length the point of our descent we reach'd
1077,CANTO XXIV,"From the last flag: soon as to that arriv'd,"
1078,CANTO XXIV,"So was the breath exhausted from my lungs,"
1079,CANTO XXIV,"I could no further, but did seat me there."
1080,CANTO XXIV,
1081,CANTO XXIV,"""Now needs thy best of man;"" so spake my guide:"
1082,CANTO XXIV,"""For not on downy plumes, nor under shade"
1083,CANTO XXIV,"Of canopy reposing, fame is won,"
1084,CANTO XXIV,Without which whosoe'er consumes his days
1085,CANTO XXIV,"Leaveth such vestige of himself on earth,"
1086,CANTO XXIV,As smoke in air or foam upon the wave.
1087,CANTO XXIV,Thou therefore rise: vanish thy weariness
1088,CANTO XXIV,"By the mind's effort, in each struggle form'd"
1089,CANTO XXIV,"To vanquish, if she suffer not the weight"
1090,CANTO XXIV,Of her corporeal frame to crush her down.
1091,CANTO XXIV,A longer ladder yet remains to scale.
1092,CANTO XXIV,From these to have escap'd sufficeth not.
1093,CANTO XXIV,"If well thou note me, profit by my words."""
1094,CANTO XXIV,
1095,CANTO XXIV,"I straightway rose, and show'd myself less spent"
1096,CANTO XXIV,"Than I in truth did feel me.  ""On,"" I cried,"
1097,CANTO XXIV,"""For I am stout and fearless.""  Up the rock"
1098,CANTO XXIV,"Our way we held, more rugged than before,"
1099,CANTO XXIV,Narrower and steeper far to climb.  From talk
1100,CANTO XXIV,"I ceas'd not, as we journey'd, so to seem"
1101,CANTO XXIV,Least faint; whereat a voice from the other foss
1102,CANTO XXIV,"Did issue forth, for utt'rance suited ill."
1103,CANTO XXIV,"Though on the arch that crosses there I stood,"
1104,CANTO XXIV,"What were the words I knew not, but who spake"
1105,CANTO XXIV,"Seem'd mov'd in anger.  Down I stoop'd to look,"
1106,CANTO XXIV,But my quick eye might reach not to the depth
1107,CANTO XXIV,For shrouding darkness; wherefore thus I spake:
1108,CANTO XXIV,"""To the next circle, Teacher, bend thy steps,"
1109,CANTO XXIV,And from the wall dismount we; for as hence
1110,CANTO XXIV,"I hear and understand not, so I see"
1111,CANTO XXIV,"Beneath, and naught discern.""--""I answer not,"""
1112,CANTO XXIV,"Said he, ""but by the deed.  To fair request"
1113,CANTO XXIV,"Silent performance maketh best return."""
1114,CANTO XXIV,
1115,CANTO XXIV,"We from the bridge's head descended, where"
1116,CANTO XXIV,"To the eighth mound it joins, and then the chasm"
1117,CANTO XXIV,"Opening to view, I saw a crowd within"
1118,CANTO XXIV,"Of serpents terrible, so strange of shape"
1119,CANTO XXIV,"And hideous, that remembrance in my veins"
1120,CANTO XXIV,Yet shrinks the vital current.  Of her sands
1121,CANTO XXIV,"Let Lybia vaunt no more: if Jaculus,"
1122,CANTO XXIV,"Pareas and Chelyder be her brood,"
1123,CANTO XXIV,"Cenchris and Amphisboena, plagues so dire"
1124,CANTO XXIV,"Or in such numbers swarming ne'er she shew'd,"
1125,CANTO XXIV,"Not with all Ethiopia, and whate'er"
1126,CANTO XXIV,Above the Erythraean sea is spawn'd.
1127,CANTO XXIV,
1128,CANTO XXIV,Amid this dread exuberance of woe
1129,CANTO XXIV,"Ran naked spirits wing'd with horrid fear,"
1130,CANTO XXIV,"Nor hope had they of crevice where to hide,"
1131,CANTO XXIV,Or heliotrope to charm them out of view.
1132,CANTO XXIV,"With serpents were their hands behind them bound,"
1133,CANTO XXIV,Which through their reins infix'd the tail and head
1134,CANTO XXIV,Twisted in folds before.  And lo! on one
1135,CANTO XXIV,"Near to our side, darted an adder up,"
1136,CANTO XXIV,"And, where the neck is on the shoulders tied,"
1137,CANTO XXIV,Transpierc'd him.  Far more quickly than e'er pen
1138,CANTO XXIV,"Wrote O or I, he kindled, burn'd, and chang'd"
1139,CANTO XXIV,"To ashes, all pour'd out upon the earth."
1140,CANTO XXIV,"When there dissolv'd he lay, the dust again"
1141,CANTO XXIV,"Uproll'd spontaneous, and the self-same form"
1142,CANTO XXIV,"Instant resumed.  So mighty sages tell,"
1143,CANTO XXIV,"The' Arabian Phoenix, when five hundred years"
1144,CANTO XXIV,"Have well nigh circled, dies, and springs forthwith"
1145,CANTO XXIV,Renascent.  Blade nor herb throughout his life
1146,CANTO XXIV,"He tastes, but tears of frankincense alone"
1147,CANTO XXIV,And odorous amomum: swaths of nard
1148,CANTO XXIV,"And myrrh his funeral shroud.  As one that falls,"
1149,CANTO XXIV,"He knows not how, by force demoniac dragg'd"
1150,CANTO XXIV,"To earth, or through obstruction fettering up"
1151,CANTO XXIV,"In chains invisible the powers of man,"
1152,CANTO XXIV,"Who, risen from his trance, gazeth around,"
1153,CANTO XXIV,Bewilder'd with the monstrous agony
1154,CANTO XXIV,"He hath endur'd, and wildly staring sighs;"
1155,CANTO XXIV,So stood aghast the sinner when he rose.
1156,CANTO XXIV,
1157,CANTO XXIV,"Oh! how severe God's judgment, that deals out"
1158,CANTO XXIV,Such blows in stormy vengeance!  Who he was
1159,CANTO XXIV,"My teacher next inquir'd, and thus in few"
1160,CANTO XXIV,"He answer'd: ""Vanni Fucci am I call'd,"
1161,CANTO XXIV,Not long since rained down from Tuscany
1162,CANTO XXIV,To this dire gullet.  Me the beastial life
1163,CANTO XXIV,"And not the human pleas'd, mule that I was,"
1164,CANTO XXIV,"Who in Pistoia found my worthy den."""
1165,CANTO XXIV,
1166,CANTO XXIV,"I then to Virgil: ""Bid him stir not hence,"
1167,CANTO XXIV,And ask what crime did thrust him hither: once
1168,CANTO XXIV,"A man I knew him choleric and bloody."""
1169,CANTO XXIV,
1170,CANTO XXIV,"The sinner heard and feign'd not, but towards me"
1171,CANTO XXIV,"His mind directing and his face, wherein"
1172,CANTO XXIV,"Was dismal shame depictur'd, thus he spake:"
1173,CANTO XXIV,"""It grieves me more to have been caught by thee"
1174,CANTO XXIV,"In this sad plight, which thou beholdest, than"
1175,CANTO XXIV,When I was taken from the other life.
1176,CANTO XXIV,I have no power permitted to deny
1177,CANTO XXIV,What thou inquirest.  I am doom'd thus low
1178,CANTO XXIV,"To dwell, for that the sacristy by me"
1179,CANTO XXIV,"Was rifled of its goodly ornaments,"
1180,CANTO XXIV,And with the guilt another falsely charged.
1181,CANTO XXIV,"But that thou mayst not joy to see me thus,"
1182,CANTO XXIV,So as thou e'er shalt 'scape this darksome realm
1183,CANTO XXIV,Open thine ears and hear what I forebode.
1184,CANTO XXIV,"Reft of the Neri first Pistoia pines,"
1185,CANTO XXIV,Then Florence changeth citizens and laws.
1186,CANTO XXIV,"From Valdimagra, drawn by wrathful Mars,"
1187,CANTO XXIV,"A vapour rises, wrapt in turbid mists,"
1188,CANTO XXIV,And sharp and eager driveth on the storm
1189,CANTO XXIV,"With arrowy hurtling o'er Piceno's field,"
1190,CANTO XXIV,"Whence suddenly the cloud shall burst, and strike"
1191,CANTO XXIV,Each helpless Bianco prostrate to the ground.
1192,CANTO XXIV,"This have I told, that grief may rend thy heart."""

1199,CANTO XXV,"WHEN he had spoke, the sinner rais'd his hands"
1200,CANTO XXV,"Pointed in mockery, and cried: ""Take them, God!"
1201,CANTO XXV,"I level them at thee!""  From that day forth"
1202,CANTO XXV,The serpents were my friends; for round his neck
1203,CANTO XXV,"One of then rolling twisted, as it said,"
1204,CANTO XXV,"""Be silent, tongue!""  Another to his arms"
1205,CANTO XXV,"Upgliding, tied them, riveting itself"
1206,CANTO XXV,"So close, it took from them the power to move."
1207,CANTO XXV,
1208,CANTO XXV,Pistoia!  Ah Pistoia! why dost doubt
1209,CANTO XXV,"To turn thee into ashes, cumb'ring earth"
1210,CANTO XXV,"No longer, since in evil act so far"
1211,CANTO XXV,"Thou hast outdone thy seed?  I did not mark,"
1212,CANTO XXV,"Through all the gloomy circles of the' abyss,"
1213,CANTO XXV,"Spirit, that swell'd so proudly 'gainst his God,"
1214,CANTO XXV,"Not him, who headlong fell from Thebes.  He fled,"
1215,CANTO XXV,Nor utter'd more; and after him there came
1216,CANTO XXV,"A centaur full of fury, shouting, ""Where"
1217,CANTO XXV,"Where is the caitiff?""  On Maremma's marsh"
1218,CANTO XXV,"Swarm not the serpent tribe, as on his haunch"
1219,CANTO XXV,"They swarm'd, to where the human face begins."
1220,CANTO XXV,"Behind his head upon the shoulders lay,"
1221,CANTO XXV,"With open wings, a dragon breathing fire"
1222,CANTO XXV,On whomsoe'er he met.  To me my guide:
1223,CANTO XXV,"""Cacus is this, who underneath the rock"
1224,CANTO XXV,Of Aventine spread oft a lake of blood.
1225,CANTO XXV,"He, from his brethren parted, here must tread"
1226,CANTO XXV,"A different journey, for his fraudful theft"
1227,CANTO XXV,"Of the great herd, that near him stall'd; whence found"
1228,CANTO XXV,"His felon deeds their end, beneath the mace"
1229,CANTO XXV,"Of stout Alcides, that perchance laid on"
1230,CANTO XXV,"A hundred blows, and not the tenth was felt."""
1231,CANTO XXV,
1232,CANTO XXV,"While yet he spake, the centaur sped away:"
1233,CANTO XXV,"And under us three spirits came, of whom"
1234,CANTO XXV,"Nor I nor he was ware, till they exclaim'd;"
1235,CANTO XXV,"""Say who are ye?""  We then brake off discourse,"
1236,CANTO XXV,Intent on these alone.  I knew them not;
1237,CANTO XXV,"But, as it chanceth oft, befell, that one"
1238,CANTO XXV,"Had need to name another.  ""Where,"" said he,"
1239,CANTO XXV,"""Doth Cianfa lurk?""  I, for a sign my guide"
1240,CANTO XXV,"Should stand attentive, plac'd against my lips"
1241,CANTO XXV,"The finger lifted.  If, O reader! now"
1242,CANTO XXV,"Thou be not apt to credit what I tell,"
1243,CANTO XXV,No marvel; for myself do scarce allow
1244,CANTO XXV,The witness of mine eyes.  But as I looked
1245,CANTO XXV,"Toward them, lo! a serpent with six feet"
1246,CANTO XXV,"Springs forth on one, and fastens full upon him:"
1247,CANTO XXV,"His midmost grasp'd the belly, a forefoot"
1248,CANTO XXV,Seiz'd on each arm (while deep in either cheek
1249,CANTO XXV,He flesh'd his fangs); the hinder on the thighs
1250,CANTO XXV,"Were spread, 'twixt which the tail inserted curl'd"
1251,CANTO XXV,Upon the reins behind.  Ivy ne'er clasp'd
1252,CANTO XXV,"A dodder'd oak, as round the other's limbs"
1253,CANTO XXV,The hideous monster intertwin'd his own.
1254,CANTO XXV,"Then, as they both had been of burning wax,"
1255,CANTO XXV,"Each melted into other, mingling hues,"
1256,CANTO XXV,That which was either now was seen no more.
1257,CANTO XXV,"Thus up the shrinking paper, ere it burns,"
1258,CANTO XXV,"A brown tint glides, not turning yet to black,"
1259,CANTO XXV,And the clean white expires.  The other two
1260,CANTO XXV,"Look'd on exclaiming: ""Ah, how dost thou change,"
1261,CANTO XXV,"Agnello!  See!  Thou art nor double now,"
1262,CANTO XXV,
1263,CANTO XXV,"""Nor only one.""  The two heads now became"
1264,CANTO XXV,"One, and two figures blended in one form"
1265,CANTO XXV,"Appear'd, where both were lost.  Of the four lengths"
1266,CANTO XXV,Two arms were made: the belly and the chest
1267,CANTO XXV,"The thighs and legs into such members chang'd,"
1268,CANTO XXV,As never eye hath seen.  Of former shape
1269,CANTO XXV,All trace was vanish'd.  Two yet neither seem'd
1270,CANTO XXV,"That image miscreate, and so pass'd on"
1271,CANTO XXV,With tardy steps.  As underneath the scourge
1272,CANTO XXV,"Of the fierce dog-star, that lays bare the fields,"
1273,CANTO XXV,"Shifting from brake to brake, the lizard seems"
1274,CANTO XXV,"A flash of lightning, if he thwart the road,"
1275,CANTO XXV,So toward th' entrails of the other two
1276,CANTO XXV,"Approaching seem'd, an adder all on fire,"
1277,CANTO XXV,"As the dark pepper-grain, livid and swart."
1278,CANTO XXV,"In that part, whence our life is nourish'd first,"
1279,CANTO XXV,One he transpierc'd; then down before him fell
1280,CANTO XXV,Stretch'd out.  The pierced spirit look'd on him
1281,CANTO XXV,"But spake not; yea stood motionless and yawn'd,"
1282,CANTO XXV,As if by sleep or fev'rous fit assail'd.
1283,CANTO XXV,"He ey'd the serpent, and the serpent him."
1284,CANTO XXV,"One from the wound, the other from the mouth"
1285,CANTO XXV,"Breath'd a thick smoke, whose vap'ry columns join'd."
1286,CANTO XXV,
1287,CANTO XXV,"Lucan in mute attention now may hear,"
1288,CANTO XXV,"Nor thy disastrous fate, Sabellus! tell,"
1289,CANTO XXV,"Nor shine, Nasidius!  Ovid now be mute."
1290,CANTO XXV,What if in warbling fiction he record
1291,CANTO XXV,"Cadmus and Arethusa, to a snake"
1292,CANTO XXV,"Him chang'd, and her into a fountain clear,"
1293,CANTO XXV,I envy not; for never face to face
1294,CANTO XXV,"Two natures thus transmuted did he sing,"
1295,CANTO XXV,Wherein both shapes were ready to assume
1296,CANTO XXV,The other's substance.  They in mutual guise
1297,CANTO XXV,"So answer'd, that the serpent split his train"
1298,CANTO XXV,"Divided to a fork, and the pierc'd spirit"
1299,CANTO XXV,"Drew close his steps together, legs and thighs"
1300,CANTO XXV,"Compacted, that no sign of juncture soon"
1301,CANTO XXV,Was visible: the tail disparted took
1302,CANTO XXV,"The figure which the spirit lost, its skin"
1303,CANTO XXV,"Soft'ning, his indurated to a rind."
1304,CANTO XXV,"The shoulders next I mark'd, that ent'ring join'd"
1305,CANTO XXV,"The monster's arm-pits, whose two shorter feet"
1306,CANTO XXV,"So lengthen'd, as the other's dwindling shrunk."
1307,CANTO XXV,The feet behind then twisting up became
1308,CANTO XXV,"That part that man conceals, which in the wretch"
1309,CANTO XXV,Was cleft in twain.  While both the shadowy smoke
1310,CANTO XXV,"With a new colour veils, and generates"
1311,CANTO XXV,"Th' excrescent pile on one, peeling it off"
1312,CANTO XXV,"From th' other body, lo! upon his feet"
1313,CANTO XXV,"One upright rose, and prone the other fell."
1314,CANTO XXV,Not yet their glaring and malignant lamps
1315,CANTO XXV,"Were shifted, though each feature chang'd beneath."
1316,CANTO XXV,"Of him who stood erect, the mounting face"
1317,CANTO XXV,"Retreated towards the temples, and what there"
1318,CANTO XXV,"Superfluous matter came, shot out in ears"
1319,CANTO XXV,"From the smooth cheeks, the rest, not backward dragg'd,"
1320,CANTO XXV,Of its excess did shape the nose; and swell'd
1321,CANTO XXV,Into due size protuberant the lips.
1322,CANTO XXV,"He, on the earth who lay, meanwhile extends"
1323,CANTO XXV,"His sharpen'd visage, and draws down the ears"
1324,CANTO XXV,"Into the head, as doth the slug his horns."
1325,CANTO XXV,His tongue continuous before and apt
1326,CANTO XXV,"For utt'rance, severs; and the other's fork"
1327,CANTO XXV,Closing unites.  That done the smoke was laid.
1328,CANTO XXV,"The soul, transform'd into the brute, glides off,"
1329,CANTO XXV,"Hissing along the vale, and after him"
1330,CANTO XXV,The other talking sputters; but soon turn'd
1331,CANTO XXV,"His new-grown shoulders on him, and in few"
1332,CANTO XXV,"Thus to another spake: ""Along this path"
1333,CANTO XXV,"Crawling, as I have done, speed Buoso now!"""
1334,CANTO XXV,
1335,CANTO XXV,So saw I fluctuate in successive change
1336,CANTO XXV,Th' unsteady ballast of the seventh hold:
1337,CANTO XXV,"And here if aught my tongue have swerv'd, events"
1338,CANTO XXV,So strange may be its warrant.  O'er mine eyes
1339,CANTO XXV,"Confusion hung, and on my thoughts amaze."
1340,CANTO XXV,
1341,CANTO XXV,"Yet 'scap'd they not so covertly, but well"
1342,CANTO XXV,I mark'd Sciancato: he alone it was
1343,CANTO XXV,"Of the three first that came, who chang'd not: thou,"
1344,CANTO XXV,"The other's fate, Gaville, still dost rue."
1345,CANTO XXV,
1346,CANTO XXV,
1347,CANTO XXV,
1348,CANTO XXV,
1349,CANTO XXVI,CANTO XXVI
1350,CANTO XXVI,
1351,CANTO XXVI,FLORENCE exult! for thou so mightily
1352,CANTO XXVI,"Hast thriven, that o'er land and sea thy wings"
1353,CANTO XXVI,"Thou beatest, and thy name spreads over hell!"
1354,CANTO XXVI,Among the plund'rers such the three I found
1355,CANTO XXVI,"Thy citizens, whence shame to me thy son,"
1356,CANTO XXVI,And no proud honour to thyself redounds.
1357,CANTO XXVI,
1358,CANTO XXVI,"But if our minds, when dreaming near the dawn,"
1359,CANTO XXVI,"Are of the truth presageful, thou ere long"
1360,CANTO XXVI,"Shalt feel what Prato, (not to say the rest)"
1361,CANTO XXVI,Would fain might come upon thee; and that chance
1362,CANTO XXVI,"Were in good time, if it befell thee now."
1363,CANTO XXVI,"Would so it were, since it must needs befall!"
1364,CANTO XXVI,"For as time wears me, I shall grieve the more."
1365,CANTO XXVI,
1366,CANTO XXVI,We from the depth departed; and my guide
1367,CANTO XXVI,"Remounting scal'd the flinty steps, which late"
1368,CANTO XXVI,"We downward trac'd, and drew me up the steep."
1369,CANTO XXVI,Pursuing thus our solitary way
1370,CANTO XXVI,"Among the crags and splinters of the rock,"
1371,CANTO XXVI,Sped not our feet without the help of hands.
1372,CANTO XXVI,
1373,CANTO XXVI,"Then sorrow seiz'd me, which e'en now revives,"
1374,CANTO XXVI,"As my thought turns again to what I saw,"
1375,CANTO XXVI,"And, more than I am wont, I rein and curb"
1376,CANTO XXVI,"The powers of nature in me, lest they run"
1377,CANTO XXVI,Where Virtue guides not; that if aught of good
1378,CANTO XXVI,"My gentle star, or something better gave me,"
1379,CANTO XXVI,I envy not myself the precious boon.
1380,CANTO XXVI,
1381,CANTO XXVI,"As in that season, when the sun least veils"
1382,CANTO XXVI,"His face that lightens all, what time the fly"
1383,CANTO XXVI,"Gives way to the shrill gnat, the peasant then"
1384,CANTO XXVI,"Upon some cliff reclin'd, beneath him sees"
1385,CANTO XXVI,"Fire-flies innumerous spangling o'er the vale,"
1386,CANTO XXVI,"Vineyard or tilth, where his day-labour lies:"
1387,CANTO XXVI,With flames so numberless throughout its space
1388,CANTO XXVI,"Shone the eighth chasm, apparent, when the depth"
1389,CANTO XXVI,"Was to my view expos'd. As he, whose wrongs"
1390,CANTO XXVI,"The bears aveng'd, at its departure saw"
1391,CANTO XXVI,"Elijah's chariot, when the steeds erect"
1392,CANTO XXVI,"Rais'd their steep flight for heav'n; his eyes meanwhile,"
1393,CANTO XXVI,"Straining pursu'd them, till the flame alone"
1394,CANTO XXVI,Upsoaring like a misty speck he kenn'd;
1395,CANTO XXVI,"E'en thus along the gulf moves every flame,"
1396,CANTO XXVI,"A sinner so enfolded close in each,"
1397,CANTO XXVI,That none exhibits token of the theft.
1398,CANTO XXVI,
1399,CANTO XXVI,"Upon the bridge I forward bent to look,"
1400,CANTO XXVI,"And grasp'd a flinty mass, or else had fall'n,"
1401,CANTO XXVI,"Though push'd not from the height.  The guide, who mark'd"
1402,CANTO XXVI,"How I did gaze attentive, thus began:"
1403,CANTO XXVI,
1404,CANTO XXVI,"""Within these ardours are the spirits, each"
1405,CANTO XXVI,"Swath'd in confining fire.""--""Master, thy word,"""
1406,CANTO XXVI,"I answer'd, ""hath assur'd me; yet I deem'd"
1407,CANTO XXVI,"Already of the truth, already wish'd"
1408,CANTO XXVI,"To ask thee, who is in yon fire, that comes"
1409,CANTO XXVI,"So parted at the summit, as it seem'd"
1410,CANTO XXVI,"Ascending from that funeral pile, where lay"
1411,CANTO XXVI,"The Theban brothers?""  He replied: ""Within"
1412,CANTO XXVI,Ulysses there and Diomede endure
1413,CANTO XXVI,"Their penal tortures, thus to vengeance now"
1414,CANTO XXVI,"Together hasting, as erewhile to wrath."
1415,CANTO XXVI,These in the flame with ceaseless groans deplore
1416,CANTO XXVI,"The ambush of the horse, that open'd wide"
1417,CANTO XXVI,"A portal for that goodly seed to pass,"
1418,CANTO XXVI,Which sow'd imperial Rome; nor less the guile
1419,CANTO XXVI,"Lament they, whence of her Achilles 'reft"
1420,CANTO XXVI,Deidamia yet in death complains.
1421,CANTO XXVI,"And there is rued the stratagem, that Troy"
1422,CANTO XXVI,"Of her Palladium spoil'd.""--""If they have power"
1423,CANTO XXVI,"Of utt'rance from within these sparks,"" said I,"
1424,CANTO XXVI,"""O master! think my prayer a thousand fold"
1425,CANTO XXVI,"In repetition urg'd, that thou vouchsafe"
1426,CANTO XXVI,"To pause, till here the horned flame arrive."
1427,CANTO XXVI,"See, how toward it with desire I bend."""
1428,CANTO XXVI,
1429,CANTO XXVI,"He thus: ""Thy prayer is worthy of much praise,"
1430,CANTO XXVI,And I accept it therefore: but do thou
1431,CANTO XXVI,"Thy tongue refrain: to question them be mine,"
1432,CANTO XXVI,"For I divine thy wish: and they perchance,"
1433,CANTO XXVI,"For they were Greeks, might shun discourse with thee."""
1434,CANTO XXVI,
1435,CANTO XXVI,"When there the flame had come, where time and place"
1436,CANTO XXVI,"Seem'd fitting to my guide, he thus began:"
1437,CANTO XXVI,"""O ye, who dwell two spirits in one fire!"
1438,CANTO XXVI,"If living I of you did merit aught,"
1439,CANTO XXVI,"Whate'er the measure were of that desert,"
1440,CANTO XXVI,"When in the world my lofty strain I pour'd,"
1441,CANTO XXVI,"Move ye not on, till one of you unfold"
1442,CANTO XXVI,"In what clime death o'ertook him self-destroy'd."""
1443,CANTO XXVI,
1444,CANTO XXVI,Of the old flame forthwith the greater horn
1445,CANTO XXVI,"Began to roll, murmuring, as a fire"
1446,CANTO XXVI,"That labours with the wind, then to and fro"
1447,CANTO XXVI,"Wagging the top, as a tongue uttering sounds,"
1448,CANTO XXVI,"Threw out its voice, and spake: ""When I escap'd"
1449,CANTO XXVI,"From Circe, who beyond a circling year"
1450,CANTO XXVI,"Had held me near Caieta, by her charms,"
1451,CANTO XXVI,"Ere thus Aeneas yet had nam'd the shore,"
1452,CANTO XXVI,"Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence"
1453,CANTO XXVI,"Of my old father, nor return of love,"
1454,CANTO XXVI,"That should have crown'd Penelope with joy,"
1455,CANTO XXVI,Could overcome in me the zeal I had
1456,CANTO XXVI,"T' explore the world, and search the ways of life,"
1457,CANTO XXVI,Man's evil and his virtue.  Forth I sail'd
1458,CANTO XXVI,"Into the deep illimitable main,"
1459,CANTO XXVI,"With but one bark, and the small faithful band"
1460,CANTO XXVI,"That yet cleav'd to me.  As Iberia far,"
1461,CANTO XXVI,"Far as Morocco either shore I saw,"
1462,CANTO XXVI,And the Sardinian and each isle beside
1463,CANTO XXVI,Which round that ocean bathes.  Tardy with age
1464,CANTO XXVI,"Were I and my companions, when we came"
1465,CANTO XXVI,"To the strait pass, where Hercules ordain'd"
1466,CANTO XXVI,The bound'ries not to be o'erstepp'd by man.
1467,CANTO XXVI,"The walls of Seville to my right I left,"
1468,CANTO XXVI,On the' other hand already Ceuta past.
1469,CANTO XXVI,
1470,CANTO XXVI,"""O brothers!""  I began, ""who to the west"
1471,CANTO XXVI,"Through perils without number now have reach'd,"
1472,CANTO XXVI,"To this the short remaining watch, that yet"
1473,CANTO XXVI,"Our senses have to wake, refuse not proof"
1474,CANTO XXVI,"Of the unpeopled world, following the track"
1475,CANTO XXVI,Of Phoebus. Call to mind from whence we sprang:
1476,CANTO XXVI,Ye were not form'd to live the life of brutes
1477,CANTO XXVI,But virtue to pursue and knowledge high.
1478,CANTO XXVI,With these few words I sharpen'd for the voyage
1479,CANTO XXVI,"The mind of my associates, that I then"
1480,CANTO XXVI,Could scarcely have withheld them.  To the dawn
1481,CANTO XXVI,"Our poop we turn'd, and for the witless flight"
1482,CANTO XXVI,"Made our oars wings, still gaining on the left."
1483,CANTO XXVI,"Each star of the' other pole night now beheld,"
1484,CANTO XXVI,"And ours so low, that from the ocean-floor"
1485,CANTO XXVI,"It rose not.  Five times re-illum'd, as oft"
1486,CANTO XXVI,Vanish'd the light from underneath the moon
1487,CANTO XXVI,"Since the deep way we enter'd, when from far"
1488,CANTO XXVI,"Appear'd a mountain dim, loftiest methought"
1489,CANTO XXVI,"Of all I e'er beheld.  Joy seiz'd us straight,"
1490,CANTO XXVI,But soon to mourning changed.  From the new land
1491,CANTO XXVI,"A whirlwind sprung, and at her foremost side"
1492,CANTO XXVI,Did strike the vessel.  Thrice it whirl'd her round
1493,CANTO XXVI,"With all the waves, the fourth time lifted up"
1494,CANTO XXVI,"The poop, and sank the prow: so fate decreed:"
1495,CANTO XXVI,"And over us the booming billow clos'd."""

1511,CANTO XVII,"Tormented, that the brazen monster seem'd"

1513,CANTO XVII,"Nor avenue immediate through the flame,"
1514,CANTO XVII,Into its language turn'd the dismal words:
1515,CANTO XVII,"But soon as they had won their passage forth,"

2347,CANTO XXXII,"His firm abutment rears, then might the vein"
2348,CANTO XXXII,Of fancy rise full springing: but not mine
2349,CANTO XXXII,"Such measures, and with falt'ring awe I touch"
2350,CANTO XXXII,The mighty theme; for to describe the depth
2351,CANTO XXXII,"Of all the universe, is no emprize"
2352,CANTO XXXII,"To jest with, and demands a tongue not us'd"
2353,CANTO XXXII,To infant babbling.  But let them assist

2356,CANTO XXXII,"My speech shall best accord.  Oh ill-starr'd folk,"
2357,CANTO XXXII,Beyond all others wretched! who abide
2358,CANTO XXXII,"In such a mansion, as scarce thought finds words"
2359,CANTO XXXII,"To speak of, better had ye here on earth"
2360,CANTO XXXII,Been flocks or mountain goats.  As down we stood
2361,CANTO XXXII,"In the dark pit beneath the giants' feet,"
2362,CANTO XXXII,"But lower far than they, and I did gaze"
2363,CANTO XXXII,"Still on the lofty battlement, a voice"
2364,CANTO XXXII,"Bespoke me thus: ""Look how thou walkest.  Take"
2365,CANTO XXXII,"Good heed, thy soles do tread not on the heads"
2366,CANTO XXXII,"Of thy poor brethren.""  Thereupon I turn'd,"
2367,CANTO XXXII,And saw before and underneath my feet
2368,CANTO XXXII,"A lake, whose frozen surface liker seem'd"
2369,CANTO XXXII,To glass than water.  Not so thick a veil
2370,CANTO XXXII,In winter e'er hath Austrian Danube spread
2371,CANTO XXXII,"O'er his still course, nor Tanais far remote"
2372,CANTO XXXII,Under the chilling sky.  Roll'd o'er that mass
2373,CANTO XXXII,"Had Tabernich or Pietrapana fall'n,"
2374,CANTO XXXII,
2375,CANTO XXXII,Not e'en its rim had creak'd. As peeps the frog
2376,CANTO XXXII,"Croaking above the wave, what time in dreams"
2377,CANTO XXXII,"The village gleaner oft pursues her toil,"
2378,CANTO XXXII,"So, to where modest shame appears, thus low"
2379,CANTO XXXII,"Blue pinch'd and shrin'd in ice the spirits stood,"
2380,CANTO XXXII,Moving their teeth in shrill note like the stork.
2381,CANTO XXXII,"His face each downward held; their mouth the cold,"
2382,CANTO XXXII,Their eyes express'd the dolour of their heart.
2383,CANTO XXXII,
2384,CANTO XXXII,"A space I look'd around, then at my feet"
2385,CANTO XXXII,"Saw two so strictly join'd, that of their head"
2386,CANTO XXXII,"The very hairs were mingled.  ""Tell me ye,"
2387,CANTO XXXII,"Whose bosoms thus together press,"" said I,"
2388,CANTO XXXII,"""Who are ye?""  At that sound their necks they bent,"
2389,CANTO XXXII,"And when their looks were lifted up to me,"
2390,CANTO XXXII,"Straightway their eyes, before all moist within,"
2391,CANTO XXXII,"Distill'd upon their lips, and the frost bound"
2392,CANTO XXXII,The tears betwixt those orbs and held them there.
2393,CANTO XXXII,Plank unto plank hath never cramp clos'd up
2394,CANTO XXXII,So stoutly.  Whence like two enraged goats
2395,CANTO XXXII,They clash'd together; them such fury seiz'd.
2396,CANTO XXXII,
2397,CANTO XXXII,"And one, from whom the cold both ears had reft,"
2398,CANTO XXXII,"Exclaim'd, still looking downward: ""Why on us"
2399,CANTO XXXII,Dost speculate so long?  If thou wouldst know
2400,CANTO XXXII,"Who are these two, the valley, whence his wave"
2401,CANTO XXXII,"Bisenzio slopes, did for its master own"
2402,CANTO XXXII,"Their sire Alberto, and next him themselves."
2403,CANTO XXXII,They from one body issued; and throughout
2404,CANTO XXXII,"Caina thou mayst search, nor find a shade"
2405,CANTO XXXII,"More worthy in congealment to be fix'd,"
2406,CANTO XXXII,"Not him, whose breast and shadow Arthur's land"

2408,CANTO XXXII,"No not this spirit, whose o'erjutting head"
2409,CANTO XXXII,Obstructs my onward view: he bore the name
2410,CANTO XXXII,"Of Mascheroni: Tuscan if thou be,"
2411,CANTO XXXII,Well knowest who he was: and to cut short
2412,CANTO XXXII,"All further question, in my form behold"
2413,CANTO XXXII,What once was Camiccione.  I await
2414,CANTO XXXII,"Carlino here my kinsman, whose deep guilt"
2415,CANTO XXXII,"Shall wash out mine.""  A thousand visages"
2416,CANTO XXXII,"Then mark'd I, which the keen and eager cold"
2417,CANTO XXXII,Had shap'd into a doggish grin; whence creeps
2418,CANTO XXXII,"A shiv'ring horror o'er me, at the thought"
2419,CANTO XXXII,Of those frore shallows.  While we journey'd on
2420,CANTO XXXII,"Toward the middle, at whose point unites"
2421,CANTO XXXII,"All heavy substance, and I trembling went"
2422,CANTO XXXII,"Through that eternal chillness, I know not"
2423,CANTO XXXII,"If will it were or destiny, or chance,"
2424,CANTO XXXII,"But, passing 'midst the heads, my foot did strike"
2425,CANTO XXXII,With violent blow against the face of one.
2426,CANTO XXXII,
2427,CANTO XXXII,"""Wherefore dost bruise me?"" weeping, he exclaim'd,"
2428,CANTO XXXII,"""Unless thy errand be some fresh revenge"
2429,CANTO XXXII,"For Montaperto, wherefore troublest me?"""
2430,CANTO XXXII,
2431,CANTO XXXII,"I thus: ""Instructor, now await me here,"
2432,CANTO XXXII,That I through him may rid me of my doubt.
2433,CANTO XXXII,"Thenceforth what haste thou wilt.""  The teacher paus'd,"
2434,CANTO XXXII,"And to that shade I spake, who bitterly"
2435,CANTO XXXII,"Still curs'd me in his wrath.  ""What art thou, speak,"
2436,CANTO XXXII,"That railest thus on others?""  He replied:"
2437,CANTO XXXII,"""Now who art thou, that smiting others' cheeks"
2438,CANTO XXXII,"Through Antenora roamest, with such force"
2439,CANTO XXXII,"As were past suff'rance, wert thou living still?"""
2440,CANTO XXXII,
2441,CANTO XXXII,"""And I am living, to thy joy perchance,"""
2442,CANTO XXXII,"Was my reply, ""if fame be dear to thee,"
2443,CANTO XXXII,"That with the rest I may thy name enrol."""
2444,CANTO XXXII,
2445,CANTO XXXII,"""The contrary of what I covet most,"""
2446,CANTO XXXII,"Said he, ""thou tender'st: hence; nor vex me more."
2447,CANTO XXXII,"Ill knowest thou to flatter in this vale."""
2448,CANTO XXXII,
2449,CANTO XXXII,"Then seizing on his hinder scalp, I cried:"
2450,CANTO XXXII,"""Name thee, or not a hair shall tarry here."""
2451,CANTO XXXII,
2452,CANTO XXXII,"""Rend all away,"" he answer'd, ""yet for that"
2453,CANTO XXXII,"I will not tell nor show thee who I am,"
2454,CANTO XXXII,"Though at my head thou pluck a thousand times."""
2455,CANTO XXXII,
2456,CANTO XXXII,"Now I had grasp'd his tresses, and stript off"
2457,CANTO XXXII,"More than one tuft, he barking, with his eyes"
2458,CANTO XXXII,"Drawn in and downward, when another cried,"
2459,CANTO XXXII,"""What ails thee, Bocca?  Sound not loud enough"
2460,CANTO XXXII,"Thy chatt'ring teeth, but thou must bark outright?"
2461,CANTO XXXII,"What devil wrings thee?""--""Now,"" said I, ""be dumb,"
2462,CANTO XXXII,Accursed traitor! to thy shame of thee
2463,CANTO XXXII,"True tidings will I bear.""--""Off,"" he replied,"
2464,CANTO XXXII,"""Tell what thou list; but as thou escape from hence"
2465,CANTO XXXII,"To speak of him whose tongue hath been so glib,"
2466,CANTO XXXII,Forget not: here he wails the Frenchman's gold.
2467,CANTO XXXII,"'Him of Duera,' thou canst say, 'I mark'd,"
2468,CANTO XXXII,Where the starv'd sinners pine.'  If thou be ask'd
2469,CANTO XXXII,"What other shade was with them, at thy side"
2470,CANTO XXXII,"Is Beccaria, whose red gorge distain'd"
2471,CANTO XXXII,"The biting axe of Florence.  Farther on,"
2472,CANTO XXXII,"If I misdeem not, Soldanieri bides,"
2473,CANTO XXXII,"With Ganellon, and Tribaldello, him"
2474,CANTO XXXII,"Who op'd Faenza when the people slept."""
2475,CANTO XXXII,
2476,CANTO XXXII,"We now had left him, passing on our way,"
2477,CANTO XXXII,When I beheld two spirits by the ice
2478,CANTO XXXII,"Pent in one hollow, that the head of one"
2479,CANTO XXXII,Was cowl unto the other; and as bread
2480,CANTO XXXII,"Is raven'd up through hunger, th' uppermost"
2481,CANTO XXXII,"Did so apply his fangs to th' other's brain,"
2482,CANTO XXXII,Where the spine joins it.  Not more furiously
2483,CANTO XXXII,"On Menalippus' temples Tydeus gnaw'd,"
2484,CANTO XXXII,Than on that skull and on its garbage he.
2485,CANTO XXXII,
2486,CANTO XXXII,"""O thou who show'st so beastly sign of hate"
2487,CANTO XXXII,"'Gainst him thou prey'st on, let me hear,"" said I"
2488,CANTO XXXII,"""The cause, on such condition, that if right"
2489,CANTO XXXII,"Warrant thy grievance, knowing who ye are,"
2490,CANTO XXXII,"And what the colour of his sinning was,"
2491,CANTO XXXII,"I may repay thee in the world above,"
2492,CANTO XXXII,"If that, wherewith I speak be moist so long."""

2496,CANTO XXXII,
2497,CANTO XXXIII,CANTO XXXIII
2498,CANTO XXXIII,
2499,CANTO XXXIII,"HIS jaws uplifting from their fell repast,"
2500,CANTO XXXIII,"That sinner wip'd them on the hairs o' th' head,"
2501,CANTO XXXIII,"Which he behind had mangled, then began:"
2502,CANTO XXXIII,"""Thy will obeying, I call up afresh"
2503,CANTO XXXIII,"Sorrow past cure, which but to think of wrings"
2504,CANTO XXXIII,"My heart, or ere I tell on't. But if words,"
2505,CANTO XXXIII,"That I may utter, shall prove seed to bear"
2506,CANTO XXXIII,"Fruit of eternal infamy to him,"
2507,CANTO XXXIII,"The traitor whom I gnaw at, thou at once"
2508,CANTO XXXIII,Shalt see me speak and weep.  Who thou mayst be
2509,CANTO XXXIII,"I know not, nor how here below art come:"
2510,CANTO XXXIII,"But Florentine thou seemest of a truth,"
2511,CANTO XXXIII,When I do hear thee.  Know I was on earth
2512,CANTO XXXIII,"Count Ugolino, and th' Archbishop he"
2513,CANTO XXXIII,"Ruggieri.  Why I neighbour him so close,"
2514,CANTO XXXIII,Now list.  That through effect of his ill thoughts
2515,CANTO XXXIII,"In him my trust reposing, I was ta'en"
2516,CANTO XXXIII,"And after murder'd, need is not I tell."
2517,CANTO XXXIII,"What therefore thou canst not have heard, that is,"
2518,CANTO XXXIII,"How cruel was the murder, shalt thou hear,"
2519,CANTO XXXIII,And know if he have wrong'd me.  A small grate
2520,CANTO XXXIII,"Within that mew, which for my sake the name"
2521,CANTO XXXIII,"Of famine bears, where others yet must pine,"
2522,CANTO XXXIII,Already through its opening sev'ral moons
2523,CANTO XXXIII,"Had shown me, when I slept the evil sleep,"
2524,CANTO XXXIII,That from the future tore the curtain off.
2525,CANTO XXXIII,"This one, methought, as master of the sport,"
2526,CANTO XXXIII,Rode forth to chase the gaunt wolf and his whelps
2527,CANTO XXXIII,"Unto the mountain, which forbids the sight"
2528,CANTO XXXIII,Of Lucca to the Pisan.  With lean brachs
2529,CANTO XXXIII,"Inquisitive and keen, before him rang'd"
2530,CANTO XXXIII,Lanfranchi with Sismondi and Gualandi.
2531,CANTO XXXIII,After short course the father and the sons
2532,CANTO XXXIII,"Seem'd tir'd and lagging, and methought I saw"
2533,CANTO XXXIII,The sharp tusks gore their sides.  When I awoke
2534,CANTO XXXIII,"Before the dawn, amid their sleep I heard"
2535,CANTO XXXIII,My sons (for they were with me) weep and ask
2536,CANTO XXXIII,"For bread.  Right cruel art thou, if no pang"
2537,CANTO XXXIII,Thou feel at thinking what my heart foretold;
2538,CANTO XXXIII,"And if not now, why use thy tears to flow?"
2539,CANTO XXXIII,Now had they waken'd; and the hour drew near
2540,CANTO XXXIII,When they were wont to bring us food; the mind
2541,CANTO XXXIII,"Of each misgave him through his dream, and I"
2542,CANTO XXXIII,"Heard, at its outlet underneath lock'd up"
2543,CANTO XXXIII,The' horrible tower: whence uttering not a word
2544,CANTO XXXIII,I look'd upon the visage of my sons.
2545,CANTO XXXIII,I wept not: so all stone I felt within.
2546,CANTO XXXIII,"They wept: and one, my little Anslem, cried:"
2547,CANTO XXXIII,"""Thou lookest so!  Father what ails thee?""  Yet"
2548,CANTO XXXIII,"I shed no tear, nor answer'd all that day"
2549,CANTO XXXIII,"Nor the next night, until another sun"
2550,CANTO XXXIII,Came out upon the world.  When a faint beam
2551,CANTO XXXIII,"Had to our doleful prison made its way,"
2552,CANTO XXXIII,And in four countenances I descry'd
2553,CANTO XXXIII,"The image of my own, on either hand"
2554,CANTO XXXIII,"Through agony I bit, and they who thought"
2555,CANTO XXXIII,"I did it through desire of feeding, rose"
2556,CANTO XXXIII,"O' th' sudden, and cried, 'Father, we should grieve"
2557,CANTO XXXIII,"Far less, if thou wouldst eat of us: thou gav'st"
2558,CANTO XXXIII,"These weeds of miserable flesh we wear,"
2559,CANTO XXXIII,
2560,CANTO XXXIII,'And do thou strip them off from us again.'
2561,CANTO XXXIII,"Then, not to make them sadder, I kept down"
2562,CANTO XXXIII,My spirit in stillness.  That day and the next
2563,CANTO XXXIII,"We all were silent.  Ah, obdurate earth!"
2564,CANTO XXXIII,Why open'dst not upon us?  When we came
2565,CANTO XXXIII,"To the fourth day, then Geddo at my feet"
2566,CANTO XXXIII,"Outstretch'd did fling him, crying, 'Hast no help"
2567,CANTO XXXIII,"For me, my father!'  There he died, and e'en"
2568,CANTO XXXIII,"Plainly as thou seest me, saw I the three"
2569,CANTO XXXIII,Fall one by one 'twixt the fifth day and sixth:
2570,CANTO XXXIII,
2571,CANTO XXXIII,"""Whence I betook me now grown blind to grope"
2572,CANTO XXXIII,"Over them all, and for three days aloud"
2573,CANTO XXXIII,Call'd on them who were dead.  Then fasting got
2574,CANTO XXXIII,"The mastery of grief.""  Thus having spoke,"
2575,CANTO XXXIII,
2576,CANTO XXXIII,Once more upon the wretched skull his teeth
2577,CANTO XXXIII,"He fasten'd, like a mastiff's 'gainst the bone"
2578,CANTO XXXIII,Firm and unyielding.  Oh thou Pisa! shame
2579,CANTO XXXIII,"Of all the people, who their dwelling make"
2580,CANTO XXXIII,"In that fair region, where th' Italian voice"
2581,CANTO XXXIII,"Is heard, since that thy neighbours are so slack"
2582,CANTO XXXIII,"To punish, from their deep foundations rise"
2583,CANTO XXXIII,"Capraia and Gorgona, and dam up"
2584,CANTO XXXIII,"The mouth of Arno, that each soul in thee"
2585,CANTO XXXIII,May perish in the waters!  What if fame
2586,CANTO XXXIII,Reported that thy castles were betray'd
2587,CANTO XXXIII,"By Ugolino, yet no right hadst thou"
2588,CANTO XXXIII,"To stretch his children on the rack.  For them,"
2589,CANTO XXXIII,"Brigata, Ugaccione, and the pair"
2590,CANTO XXXIII,"Of gentle ones, of whom my song hath told,"
2591,CANTO XXXIII,"Their tender years, thou modern Thebes! did make"
2592,CANTO XXXIII,"Uncapable of guilt.  Onward we pass'd,"
2593,CANTO XXXIII,Where others skarf'd in rugged folds of ice
2594,CANTO XXXIII,"Not on their feet were turn'd, but each revers'd."
2595,CANTO XXXIII,
2596,CANTO XXXIII,There very weeping suffers not to weep;
2597,CANTO XXXIII,For at their eyes grief seeking passage finds
2598,CANTO XXXIII,"Impediment, and rolling inward turns"
2599,CANTO XXXIII,For increase of sharp anguish: the first tears
2600,CANTO XXXIII,"Hang cluster'd, and like crystal vizors show,"
2601,CANTO XXXIII,Under the socket brimming all the cup.
2602,CANTO XXXIII,
2603,CANTO XXXIII,Now though the cold had from my face dislodg'd
2604,CANTO XXXIII,"Each feeling, as 't were callous, yet me seem'd"
2605,CANTO XXXIII,"Some breath of wind I felt.  ""Whence cometh this,"""
2606,CANTO XXXIII,"Said I, ""my master?  Is not here below"
2607,CANTO XXXIII,"All vapour quench'd?""--""'Thou shalt be speedily,"""
2608,CANTO XXXIII,"He answer'd, ""where thine eye shall tell thee whence"
2609,CANTO XXXIII,"The cause descrying of this airy shower."""
2610,CANTO XXXIII,
2611,CANTO XXXIII,Then cried out one in the chill crust who mourn'd:
2612,CANTO XXXIII,"""O souls so cruel! that the farthest post"
2613,CANTO XXXIII,"Hath been assign'd you, from this face remove"
2614,CANTO XXXIII,"The harden'd veil, that I may vent the grief"
2615,CANTO XXXIII,"Impregnate at my heart, some little space"
2616,CANTO XXXIII,"Ere it congeal again!""  I thus replied:"
2617,CANTO XXXIII,"""Say who thou wast, if thou wouldst have mine aid;"
2618,CANTO XXXIII,"And if I extricate thee not, far down"
2619,CANTO XXXIII,"As to the lowest ice may I descend!"""
2620,CANTO XXXIII,
2621,CANTO XXXIII,"""The friar Alberigo,"" answered he,"
2622,CANTO XXXIII,"""Am I, who from the evil garden pluck'd"
2623,CANTO XXXIII,"Its fruitage, and am here repaid, the date"
2624,CANTO XXXIII,"More luscious for my fig.""--""Hah!""  I exclaim'd,"
2625,CANTO XXXIII,"""Art thou too dead!""--""How in the world aloft"
2626,CANTO XXXIII,"It fareth with my body,"" answer'd he,"
2627,CANTO XXXIII,"""I am right ignorant.  Such privilege"
2628,CANTO XXXIII,"Hath Ptolomea, that ofttimes the soul"
2629,CANTO XXXIII,"Drops hither, ere by Atropos divorc'd."
2630,CANTO XXXIII,And that thou mayst wipe out more willingly
2631,CANTO XXXIII,"The glazed tear-drops that o'erlay mine eyes,"
2632,CANTO XXXIII,"Know that the soul, that moment she betrays,"
2633,CANTO XXXIII,"As I did, yields her body to a fiend"
2634,CANTO XXXIII,"Who after moves and governs it at will,"
2635,CANTO XXXIII,Till all its time be rounded; headlong she
2636,CANTO XXXIII,Falls to this cistern.  And perchance above
2637,CANTO XXXIII,"Doth yet appear the body of a ghost,"
2638,CANTO XXXIII,"Who here behind me winters.  Him thou know'st,"
2639,CANTO XXXIII,If thou but newly art arriv'd below.
2640,CANTO XXXIII,"The years are many that have pass'd away,"
2641,CANTO XXXIII,"Since to this fastness Branca Doria came."""
2642,CANTO XXXIII,
2643,CANTO XXXIII,"""Now,"" answer'd I, ""methinks thou mockest me,"
2644,CANTO XXXIII,"For Branca Doria never yet hath died,"
2645,CANTO XXXIII,"But doth all natural functions of a man,"
2646,CANTO XXXIII,"Eats, drinks, and sleeps, and putteth raiment on."""
2647,CANTO XXXIII,
2648,CANTO XXXIII,"He thus: ""Not yet unto that upper foss"
2649,CANTO XXXIII,"By th' evil talons guarded, where the pitch"
2650,CANTO XXXIII,"Tenacious boils, had Michael Zanche reach'd,"
2651,CANTO XXXIII,When this one left a demon in his stead
2652,CANTO XXXIII,"In his own body, and of one his kin,"
2653,CANTO XXXIII,Who with him treachery wrought.  But now put forth
2654,CANTO XXXIII,"Thy hand, and ope mine eyes.""  I op'd them not."
2655,CANTO XXXIII,Ill manners were best courtesy to him.
2656,CANTO XXXIII,
2657,CANTO XXXIII,"Ah Genoese! men perverse in every way,"
2658,CANTO XXXIII,"With every foulness stain'd, why from the earth"
2659,CANTO XXXIII,Are ye not cancel'd?  Such an one of yours
2660,CANTO XXXIII,"I with Romagna's darkest spirit found,"

2676,CANTO XXXIV,"Such was the fabric then methought I saw,"
2677,CANTO XXXIV,
2678,CANTO XXXIV,"To shield me from the wind, forthwith I drew"
2679,CANTO XXXIV,Behind my guide: no covert else was there.
2680,CANTO XXXIV,
2681,CANTO XXXIV,Now came I (and with fear I bid my strain
2682,CANTO XXXIV,Record the marvel) where the souls were all
2683,CANTO XXXIV,"Whelm'd underneath, transparent, as through glass"
2684,CANTO XXXIV,"Pellucid the frail stem.  Some prone were laid,"
2685,CANTO XXXIV,"Others stood upright, this upon the soles,"
2686,CANTO XXXIV,"That on his head, a third with face to feet"
2687,CANTO XXXIV,"Arch'd like a bow.  When to the point we came,"
2688,CANTO XXXIV,Whereat my guide was pleas'd that I should see
2689,CANTO XXXIV,"The creature eminent in beauty once,"
2690,CANTO XXXIV,He from before me stepp'd and made me pause.
2691,CANTO XXXIV,
2692,CANTO XXXIV,"""Lo!""  he exclaim'd, ""lo Dis! and lo the place,"
2693,CANTO XXXIV,"Where thou hast need to arm thy heart with strength."""
2694,CANTO XXXIV,
2695,CANTO XXXIV,"How frozen and how faint I then became,"
2696,CANTO XXXIV,"Ask me not, reader! for I write it not,"
2697,CANTO XXXIV,Since words would fail to tell thee of my state.
2698,CANTO XXXIV,I was not dead nor living.  Think thyself
2699,CANTO XXXIV,"If quick conception work in thee at all,"
2700,CANTO XXXIV,"How I did feel.  That emperor, who sways"
2701,CANTO XXXIV,"The realm of sorrow, at mid breast from th' ice"
2702,CANTO XXXIV,Stood forth; and I in stature am more like
2703,CANTO XXXIV,"A giant, than the giants are in his arms."
2704,CANTO XXXIV,"Mark now how great that whole must be, which suits"
2705,CANTO XXXIV,With such a part.  If he were beautiful
2706,CANTO XXXIV,"As he is hideous now, and yet did dare"
2707,CANTO XXXIV,"To scowl upon his Maker, well from him"
2708,CANTO XXXIV,May all our mis'ry flow.  Oh what a sight!
2709,CANTO XXXIV,"How passing strange it seem'd, when I did spy"
2710,CANTO XXXIV,Upon his head three faces: one in front
2711,CANTO XXXIV,"Of hue vermilion, th' other two with this"
2712,CANTO XXXIV,Midway each shoulder join'd and at the crest;
2713,CANTO XXXIV,The right 'twixt wan and yellow seem'd: the left
2714,CANTO XXXIV,"To look on, such as come from whence old Nile"
2715,CANTO XXXIV,Stoops to the lowlands.  Under each shot forth
2716,CANTO XXXIV,"Two mighty wings, enormous as became"
2717,CANTO XXXIV,A bird so vast.  Sails never such I saw
2718,CANTO XXXIV,"Outstretch'd on the wide sea.  No plumes had they,"
2719,CANTO XXXIV,"But were in texture like a bat, and these"
2720,CANTO XXXIV,"He flapp'd i' th' air, that from him issued still"
2721,CANTO XXXIV,"Three winds, wherewith Cocytus to its depth"
2722,CANTO XXXIV,Was frozen.  At six eyes he wept: the tears
2723,CANTO XXXIV,Adown three chins distill'd with bloody foam.
2724,CANTO XXXIV,At every mouth his teeth a sinner champ'd
2725,CANTO XXXIV,"Bruis'd as with pond'rous engine, so that three"
2726,CANTO XXXIV,Were in this guise tormented.  But far more
2727,CANTO XXXIV,"Than from that gnawing, was the foremost pang'd"
2728,CANTO XXXIV,"By the fierce rending, whence ofttimes the back"
2729,CANTO XXXIV,"Was stript of all its skin.  ""That upper spirit,"
2730,CANTO XXXIV,"Who hath worse punishment,"" so spake my guide,"
2731,CANTO XXXIV,"""Is Judas, he that hath his head within"
2732,CANTO XXXIV,"And plies the feet without.  Of th' other two,"
2733,CANTO XXXIV,"Whose heads are under, from the murky jaw"
2734,CANTO XXXIV,"Who hangs, is Brutus: lo! how he doth writhe"
2735,CANTO XXXIV,"And speaks not!  Th' other Cassius, that appears"
2736,CANTO XXXIV,"So large of limb.  But night now re-ascends,"
2737,CANTO XXXIV,"And it is time for parting.  All is seen."""
2738,CANTO XXXIV,
2739,CANTO XXXIV,"I clipp'd him round the neck, for so he bade;"
2740,CANTO XXXIV,"And noting time and place, he, when the wings"
2741,CANTO XXXIV,"Enough were op'd, caught fast the shaggy sides,"
2742,CANTO XXXIV,And down from pile to pile descending stepp'd
2743,CANTO XXXIV,Between the thick fell and the jagged ice.
2744,CANTO XXXIV,
2745,CANTO XXXIV,"Soon as he reach'd the point, whereat the thigh"
2746,CANTO XXXIV,"Upon the swelling of the haunches turns,"
2747,CANTO XXXIV,My leader there with pain and struggling hard
2748,CANTO XXXIV,"Turn'd round his head, where his feet stood before,"
2749,CANTO XXXIV,"And grappled at the fell, as one who mounts,"
2750,CANTO XXXIV,That into hell methought we turn'd again.
2751,CANTO XXXIV,
2752,CANTO XXXIV,"""Expect that by such stairs as these,"" thus spake"
2753,CANTO XXXIV,"The teacher, panting like a man forespent,"
2754,CANTO XXXIV,"""We must depart from evil so extreme."""
2755,CANTO XXXIV,"Then at a rocky opening issued forth,"
2756,CANTO XXXIV,"And plac'd me on a brink to sit, next join'd"
2757,CANTO XXXIV,"With wary step my side.  I rais'd mine eyes,"
2758,CANTO XXXIV,Believing that I Lucifer should see
2759,CANTO XXXIV,"Where he was lately left, but saw him now"
2760,CANTO XXXIV,"With legs held upward.  Let the grosser sort,"
2761,CANTO XXXIV,"Who see not what the point was I had pass'd,"
2762,CANTO XXXIV,Bethink them if sore toil oppress'd me then.
2763,CANTO XXXIV,
2764,CANTO XXXIV,"""Arise,"" my master cried, ""upon thy feet."
2765,CANTO XXXIV,"The way is long, and much uncouth the road;"
2766,CANTO XXXIV,And now within one hour and half of noon
2767,CANTO XXXIV,"The sun returns.""  It was no palace-hall"
2768,CANTO XXXIV,"Lofty and luminous wherein we stood,"
2769,CANTO XXXIV,But natural dungeon where ill footing was
2770,CANTO XXXIV,"And scant supply of light.  ""Ere from th' abyss"
2771,CANTO XXXIV,"I sep'rate,"" thus when risen I began,"
2772,CANTO XXXIV,"""My guide! vouchsafe few words to set me free"
2773,CANTO XXXIV,From error's thralldom.  Where is now the ice?
2774,CANTO XXXIV,How standeth he in posture thus revers'd?
2775,CANTO XXXIV,And how from eve to morn in space so brief
2776,CANTO XXXIV,"Hath the sun made his transit?""  He in few"
2777,CANTO XXXIV,"Thus answering spake: ""Thou deemest thou art still"
2778,CANTO XXXIV,"On th' other side the centre, where I grasp'd"
2779,CANTO XXXIV,"Th' abhorred worm, that boreth through the world."
2780,CANTO XXXIV,"Thou wast on th' other side, so long as I"
2781,CANTO XXXIV,"Descended; when I turn'd, thou didst o'erpass"
2782,CANTO XXXIV,"That point, to which from ev'ry part is dragg'd"
2783,CANTO XXXIV,All heavy substance.  Thou art now arriv'd
2784,CANTO XXXIV,"Under the hemisphere opposed to that,"
2785,CANTO XXXIV,"Which the great continent doth overspread,"
2786,CANTO XXXIV,And underneath whose canopy expir'd
2787,CANTO XXXIV,"The Man, that was born sinless, and so liv'd."
2788,CANTO XXXIV,"Thy feet are planted on the smallest sphere,"
2789,CANTO XXXIV,Whose other aspect is Judecca.  Morn
2790,CANTO XXXIV,"Here rises, when there evening sets: and he,"
2791,CANTO XXXIV,"Whose shaggy pile was scal'd, yet standeth fix'd,"
2792,CANTO XXXIV,As at the first.  On this part he fell down
2793,CANTO XXXIV,"From heav'n; and th' earth, here prominent before,"
2794,CANTO XXXIV,"Through fear of him did veil her with the sea,"
2795,CANTO XXXIV,And to our hemisphere retir'd.  Perchance
2796,CANTO XXXIV,To shun him was the vacant space left here
2797,CANTO XXXIV,"By what of firm land on this side appears,"
2798,CANTO XXXIV,"That sprang aloof.""  There is a place beneath,"
2799,CANTO XXXIV,"From Belzebub as distant, as extends"
2800,CANTO XXXIV,"The vaulted tomb, discover'd not by sight,"
2801,CANTO XXXIV,"But by the sound of brooklet, that descends"
2802,CANTO XXXIV,"This way along the hollow of a rock,"
2803,CANTO XXXIV,"Which, as it winds with no precipitous course,"
2804,CANTO XXXIV,The wave hath eaten.  By that hidden way
2805,CANTO XXXIV,"My guide and I did enter, to return"
2806,CANTO XXXIV,To the fair world: and heedless of repose
2807,CANTO XXXIV,"We climbed, he first, I following his steps,"
2808,CANTO XXXIV,Till on our view the beautiful lights of heav'n
2809,CANTO XXXIV,Dawn'd through a circular opening in the cave:
2810,CANTO XXXIV,Thus issuing we again beheld the stars.
