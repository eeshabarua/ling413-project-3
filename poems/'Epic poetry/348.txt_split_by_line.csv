49,PREFACE,
50,PREFACE,This volume contains practically all that remains of the post-Homeric
51,PREFACE,and pre-academic epic poetry.
52,PREFACE,
53,PREFACE,I have for the most part formed my own text. In the case of Hesiod I
54,PREFACE,have been able to use independent collations of several MSS. by Dr.
55,PREFACE,W.H.D. Rouse; otherwise I have depended on the apparatus criticus of
56,PREFACE,"the several editions, especially that of Rzach (1902). The arrangement"
57,PREFACE,"adopted in this edition, by which the complete and fragmentary poems are"
58,PREFACE,restored to the order in which they would probably have appeared had
59,PREFACE,"the Hesiodic corpus survived intact, is unusual, but should not need"
60,PREFACE,"apology; the true place for the ""Catalogues"" (for example), fragmentary"
61,PREFACE,"as they are, is certainly after the ""Theogony""."
62,PREFACE,
63,PREFACE,"In preparing the text of the ""Homeric Hymns"" my chief debt--and it is a"
64,PREFACE,heavy one--is to the edition of Allen and Sikes (1904) and to the series
65,PREFACE,"of articles in the ""Journal of Hellenic Studies"" (vols. xv.sqq.) by T.W."
66,PREFACE,Allen. To the same scholar and to the Delegates of the Clarendon Press I
67,PREFACE,"am greatly indebted for permission to use the restorations of the ""Hymn"
68,PREFACE,"to Demeter"", lines 387-401 and 462-470, printed in the Oxford Text of"
69,PREFACE,1912.
70,PREFACE,
71,PREFACE,Of the fragments of the Epic Cycle I have given only such as seemed to
72,PREFACE,"possess distinct importance or interest, and in doing so have relied"
73,PREFACE,mostly upon Kinkel's collection and on the fifth volume of the Oxford
74,PREFACE,Homer (1912).
75,PREFACE,
76,PREFACE,"The texts of the ""Batrachomyomachia"" and of the ""Contest of Homer and"
77,PREFACE,"Hesiod"" are those of Baumeister and Flach respectively: where I have"
78,PREFACE,"diverged from these, the fact has been noted."

89,INTRODUCTION,
90,INTRODUCTION,General
91,INTRODUCTION,
92,INTRODUCTION,"The early Greek epic--that is, poetry as a natural and popular, and not"
93,INTRODUCTION,(as it became later) an artificial and academic literary form--passed
94,INTRODUCTION,"through the usual three phases, of development, of maturity, and of"
95,INTRODUCTION,decline.
96,INTRODUCTION,
97,INTRODUCTION,No fragments which can be identified as belonging to the first period
98,INTRODUCTION,survive to give us even a general idea of the history of the earliest
99,INTRODUCTION,"epic, and we are therefore thrown back upon the evidence of analogy"
100,INTRODUCTION,from other forms of literature and of inference from the two great
101,INTRODUCTION,"epics which have come down to us. So reconstructed, the earliest period"
102,INTRODUCTION,appears to us as a time of slow development in which the characteristic
103,INTRODUCTION,"epic metre, diction, and structure grew up slowly from crude elements"
104,INTRODUCTION,and were improved until the verge of maturity was reached.
105,INTRODUCTION,
106,INTRODUCTION,"The second period, which produced the ""Iliad"" and the ""Odyssey"", needs"
107,INTRODUCTION,no description here: but it is very important to observe the effect
108,INTRODUCTION,of these poems on the course of post-Homeric epic. As the supreme
109,INTRODUCTION,"perfection and universality of the ""Iliad"" and the ""Odyssey"" cast into"
110,INTRODUCTION,"oblivion whatever pre-Homeric poets had essayed, so these same qualities"
111,INTRODUCTION,exercised a paralysing influence over the successors of Homer. If they
112,INTRODUCTION,"continued to sing like their great predecessor of romantic themes, they"
113,INTRODUCTION,were drawn as by a kind of magnetic attraction into the Homeric style
114,INTRODUCTION,"and manner of treatment, and became mere echoes of the Homeric voice: in"
115,INTRODUCTION,"a word, Homer had so completely exhausted the epic genre, that after him"
116,INTRODUCTION,further efforts were doomed to be merely conventional. Only the rare
117,INTRODUCTION,and exceptional genius of Vergil and Milton could use the Homeric medium
118,INTRODUCTION,without loss of individuality: and this quality none of the later epic
119,INTRODUCTION,poets seem to have possessed. Freedom from the domination of the great
120,INTRODUCTION,"tradition could only be found by seeking new subjects, and such freedom"
121,INTRODUCTION,"was really only illusionary, since romantic subjects alone are suitable"
122,INTRODUCTION,for epic treatment.
123,INTRODUCTION,
124,INTRODUCTION,"In its third period, therefore, epic poetry shows two divergent"
125,INTRODUCTION,tendencies. In Ionia and the islands the epic poets followed the Homeric
126,INTRODUCTION,"tradition, singing of romantic subjects in the now stereotyped heroic"
127,INTRODUCTION,"style, and showing originality only in their choice of legends hitherto"
128,INTRODUCTION,neglected or summarily and imperfectly treated. In continental Greece
129,INTRODUCTION,"[1101], on the other hand, but especially in Boeotia, a new form of"
130,INTRODUCTION,"epic sprang up, which for the romance and PATHOS of the Ionian School"
131,INTRODUCTION,substituted the practical and matter-of-fact. It dealt in moral and
132,INTRODUCTION,"practical maxims, in information on technical subjects which are"
133,INTRODUCTION,"of service in daily life--agriculture, astronomy, augury, and the"
134,INTRODUCTION,calendar--in matters of religion and in tracing the genealogies of men.
135,INTRODUCTION,Its attitude is summed up in the words of the Muses to the writer of the
136,INTRODUCTION,"""Theogony"": `We can tell many a feigned tale to look like truth, but we"
137,INTRODUCTION,"can, when we will, utter the truth' (""Theogony"" 26-27). Such a poetry"
138,INTRODUCTION,"could not be permanently successful, because the subjects of which it"
139,INTRODUCTION,treats--if susceptible of poetic treatment at all--were certainly not
140,INTRODUCTION,"suited for epic treatment, where unity of action which will sustain"
141,INTRODUCTION,"interest, and to which each part should contribute, is absolutely"
142,INTRODUCTION,"necessary. While, therefore, an epic like the ""Odyssey"" is an organism"
143,INTRODUCTION,"and dramatic in structure, a work such as the ""Theogony"" is a merely"
144,INTRODUCTION,"artificial collocation of facts, and, at best, a pageant. It is not"
145,INTRODUCTION,"surprising, therefore, to find that from the first the Boeotian school"
146,INTRODUCTION,"is forced to season its matter with romantic episodes, and that later"
147,INTRODUCTION,"it tends more and more to revert (as in the ""Shield of Heracles"") to the"
148,INTRODUCTION,Homeric tradition.
149,INTRODUCTION,
150,INTRODUCTION,
151,INTRODUCTION,
152,INTRODUCTION,
153,INTRODUCTION,The Boeotian School
154,INTRODUCTION,
155,INTRODUCTION,How did the continental school of epic poetry arise? There is little
156,INTRODUCTION,"definite material for an answer to this question, but the probability is"
157,INTRODUCTION,"that there were at least three contributory causes. First, it is likely"
158,INTRODUCTION,that before the rise of the Ionian epos there existed in Boeotia a
159,INTRODUCTION,"purely popular and indigenous poetry of a crude form: it comprised,"
160,INTRODUCTION,"we may suppose, versified proverbs and precepts relating to life in"
161,INTRODUCTION,"general, agricultural maxims, weather-lore, and the like. In this sense"
162,INTRODUCTION,the Boeotian poetry may be taken to have its germ in maxims similar to
163,INTRODUCTION,our English
164,INTRODUCTION,
165,INTRODUCTION,"'Till May be out, ne'er cast a clout,'"
166,INTRODUCTION,
167,INTRODUCTION,or
168,INTRODUCTION,
169,INTRODUCTION,'A rainbow in the morning
170,INTRODUCTION,Is the Shepherd's warning.'
171,INTRODUCTION,
172,INTRODUCTION,Secondly and thirdly we may ascribe the rise of the new epic to the
173,INTRODUCTION,"nature of the Boeotian people and, as already remarked, to a spirit of"
174,INTRODUCTION,"revolt against the old epic. The Boeotians, people of the class of which"
175,INTRODUCTION,"Hesiod represents himself to be the type, were essentially unromantic;"
176,INTRODUCTION,"their daily needs marked the general limit of their ideals, and, as a"
177,INTRODUCTION,"class, they cared little for works of fancy, for pathos, or for fine"
178,INTRODUCTION,thought as such. To a people of this nature the Homeric epos would
179,INTRODUCTION,"be inacceptable, and the post-Homeric epic, with its conventional"
180,INTRODUCTION,"atmosphere, its trite and hackneyed diction, and its insincere"
181,INTRODUCTION,"sentiment, would be anathema. We can imagine, therefore, that among"
182,INTRODUCTION,"such folk a settler, of Aeolic origin like Hesiod, who clearly was"
183,INTRODUCTION,"well acquainted with the Ionian epos, would naturally see that the"
184,INTRODUCTION,only outlet for his gifts lay in applying epic poetry to new themes
185,INTRODUCTION,acceptable to his hearers.
186,INTRODUCTION,
187,INTRODUCTION,Though the poems of the Boeotian school [1102] were unanimously assigned
188,INTRODUCTION,"to Hesiod down to the age of Alexandrian criticism, they were clearly"
189,INTRODUCTION,"neither the work of one man nor even of one period: some, doubtless,"
190,INTRODUCTION,were fraudulently fathered on him in order to gain currency; but it is
191,INTRODUCTION,probable that most came to be regarded as his partly because of their
192,INTRODUCTION,"general character, and partly because the names of their real authors"
193,INTRODUCTION,were lost. One fact in this attribution is remarkable--the veneration
194,INTRODUCTION,paid to Hesiod.
195,INTRODUCTION,
196,INTRODUCTION,
197,INTRODUCTION,Life of Hesiod
198,INTRODUCTION,
199,INTRODUCTION,Our information respecting Hesiod is derived in the main from notices
200,INTRODUCTION,"and allusions in the works attributed to him, and to these must be added"
201,INTRODUCTION,traditions concerning his death and burial gathered from later writers.
202,INTRODUCTION,
203,INTRODUCTION,"Hesiod's father (whose name, by a perversion of ""Works and Days"", 299"
204,INTRODUCTION,"PERSE DION GENOS to PERSE, DION GENOS, was thought to have been Dius)"
205,INTRODUCTION,"was a native of Cyme in Aeolis, where he was a seafaring trader and,"
206,INTRODUCTION,"perhaps, also a farmer. He was forced by poverty to leave his native"
207,INTRODUCTION,"place, and returned to continental Greece, where he settled at Ascra"
208,INTRODUCTION,"near Thespiae in Boeotia (""Works and Days"", 636 ff.). Either in Cyme or"
209,INTRODUCTION,"Ascra, two sons, Hesiod and Perses, were born to the settler, and these,"
210,INTRODUCTION,"after his death, divided the farm between them. Perses, however, who is"
211,INTRODUCTION,"represented as an idler and spendthrift, obtained and kept the larger"
212,INTRODUCTION,"share by bribing the corrupt 'lords' who ruled from Thespiae (""Works"
213,INTRODUCTION,"and Days"", 37-39). While his brother wasted his patrimony and ultimately"
214,INTRODUCTION,"came to want (""Works and Days"", 34 ff.), Hesiod lived a farmer's life"
215,INTRODUCTION,"until, according to the very early tradition preserved by the author of"
216,INTRODUCTION,"the ""Theogony"" (22-23), the Muses met him as he was tending sheep on"
217,INTRODUCTION,"Mt. Helicon and 'taught him a glorious song'--doubtless the ""Works and"
218,INTRODUCTION,"Days"". The only other personal reference is to his victory in a poetical"
219,INTRODUCTION,"contest at the funeral games of Amphidamas at Chalcis in Euboea, where"
220,INTRODUCTION,"he won the prize, a tripod, which he dedicated to the Muses of Helicon"
221,INTRODUCTION,"(""Works and Days"", 651-9)."
222,INTRODUCTION,
223,INTRODUCTION,"Before we go on to the story of Hesiod's death, it will be well to"
224,INTRODUCTION,"inquire how far the ""autobiographical"" notices can be treated as"
225,INTRODUCTION,"historical, especially as many critics treat some, or all of them,"
226,INTRODUCTION,as spurious. In the first place attempts have been made to show that
227,INTRODUCTION,"""Hesiod"" is a significant name and therefore fictitious: it is only"
228,INTRODUCTION,necessary to mention Goettling's derivation from IEMI to ODOS (which
229,INTRODUCTION,"would make 'Hesiod' mean the 'guide' in virtues and technical arts),"
230,INTRODUCTION,"and to refer to the pitiful attempts in the ""Etymologicum Magnum"" (s.v."
231,INTRODUCTION,"{H}ESIODUS), to show how prejudiced and lacking even in plausibility"
232,INTRODUCTION,such efforts are. It seems certain that 'Hesiod' stands as a proper name
233,INTRODUCTION,"in the fullest sense. Secondly, Hesiod claims that his father--if not"
234,INTRODUCTION,he himself--came from Aeolis and settled in Boeotia. There is fairly
235,INTRODUCTION,definite evidence to warrant our acceptance of this: the dialect of the
236,INTRODUCTION,"""Works and Days"" is shown by Rzach [1103] to contain distinct Aeolisms"
237,INTRODUCTION,apart from those which formed part of the general stock of epic poetry.
238,INTRODUCTION,And that this Aeolic speaking poet was a Boeotian of Ascra seems even
239,INTRODUCTION,"more certain, since the tradition is never once disputed, insignificant"
240,INTRODUCTION,"though the place was, even before its destruction by the Thespians."
241,INTRODUCTION,
242,INTRODUCTION,"Again, Hesiod's story of his relations with his brother Perses have been"
243,INTRODUCTION,"treated with scepticism (see Murray, ""Anc. Gk. Literature"", pp. 53-54):"
244,INTRODUCTION,"Perses, it is urged, is clearly a mere dummy, set up to be the target"
245,INTRODUCTION,for the poet's exhortations. On such a matter precise evidence is
246,INTRODUCTION,naturally not forthcoming; but all probability is against the sceptical
247,INTRODUCTION,"view. For 1) if the quarrel between the brothers were a fiction, we"
248,INTRODUCTION,should expect it to be detailed at length and not noticed allusively and
249,INTRODUCTION,"rather obscurely--as we find it; 2) as MM. Croiset remark, if the"
250,INTRODUCTION,poet needed a lay-figure the ordinary practice was to introduce some
251,INTRODUCTION,"mythological person--as, in fact, is done in the ""Precepts of Chiron""."
252,INTRODUCTION,"In a word, there is no more solid ground for treating Perses and his"
253,INTRODUCTION,quarrel with Hesiod as fictitious than there would be for treating
254,INTRODUCTION,"Cyrnus, the friend of Theognis, as mythical."
255,INTRODUCTION,
256,INTRODUCTION,"Thirdly, there is the passage in the ""Theogony"" relating to Hesiod and"
257,INTRODUCTION,the Muses. It is surely an error to suppose that lines 22-35 all refer
258,INTRODUCTION,"to Hesiod: rather, the author of the ""Theogony"" tells the story of his"
259,INTRODUCTION,own inspiration by the same Muses who once taught Hesiod glorious song.
260,INTRODUCTION,The lines 22-3 are therefore a very early piece of tradition about
261,INTRODUCTION,"Hesiod, and though the appearance of Muses must be treated as a graceful"
262,INTRODUCTION,"fiction, we find that a writer, later than the ""Works and Days"" by"
263,INTRODUCTION,"perhaps no more than three-quarters of a century, believed in the"
264,INTRODUCTION,actuality of Hesiod and in his life as a farmer or shepherd.
265,INTRODUCTION,
266,INTRODUCTION,"Lastly, there is the famous story of the contest in song at Chalcis. In"
267,INTRODUCTION,"later times the modest version in the ""Works and Days"" was elaborated,"
268,INTRODUCTION,"first by making Homer the opponent whom Hesiod conquered, while a later"
269,INTRODUCTION,period exercised its ingenuity in working up the story of the contest
270,INTRODUCTION,"into the elaborate form in which it still survives. Finally the contest,"
271,INTRODUCTION,"in which the two poets contended with hymns to Apollo [1104],"
272,INTRODUCTION,was transferred to Delos. These developments certainly need no
273,INTRODUCTION,"consideration: are we to say the same of the passage in the ""Works and"
274,INTRODUCTION,"Days""? Critics from Plutarch downwards have almost unanimously rejected"
275,INTRODUCTION,"the lines 654-662, on the ground that Hesiod's Amphidamas is the hero"
276,INTRODUCTION,"of the Lelantine Wars between Chalcis and Eretria, whose death may be"
277,INTRODUCTION,placed circa 705 B.C.--a date which is obviously too low for the
278,INTRODUCTION,"genuine Hesiod. Nevertheless, there is much to be said in defence of"
279,INTRODUCTION,"the passage. Hesiod's claim in the ""Works and Days"" is modest, since"
280,INTRODUCTION,"he neither pretends to have met Homer, nor to have sung in any but an"
281,INTRODUCTION,"impromptu, local festival, so that the supposed interpolation lacks"
282,INTRODUCTION,a sufficient motive. And there is nothing in the context to show that
283,INTRODUCTION,Hesiod's Amphidamas is to be identified with that Amphidamas whom
284,INTRODUCTION,Plutarch alone connects with the Lelantine War: the name may have been
285,INTRODUCTION,"borne by an earlier Chalcidian, an ancestor, perhaps, of the person to"
286,INTRODUCTION,whom Plutarch refers.
287,INTRODUCTION,
288,INTRODUCTION,The story of the end of Hesiod may be told in outline. After the contest
289,INTRODUCTION,"at Chalcis, Hesiod went to Delphi and there was warned that the 'issue"
290,INTRODUCTION,of death should overtake him in the fair grove of Nemean Zeus.' Avoiding
291,INTRODUCTION,"therefore Nemea on the Isthmus of Corinth, to which he supposed"
292,INTRODUCTION,"the oracle to refer, Hesiod retired to Oenoe in Locris where he was"
293,INTRODUCTION,"entertained by Amphiphanes and Ganyetor, sons of a certain Phegeus. This"
294,INTRODUCTION,"place, however, was also sacred to Nemean Zeus, and the poet, suspected"
295,INTRODUCTION,"by his hosts of having seduced their sister [1105], was murdered there."
296,INTRODUCTION,"His body, cast into the sea, was brought to shore by dolphins and buried"
297,INTRODUCTION,"at Oenoe (or, according to Plutarch, at Ascra): at a later time his"
298,INTRODUCTION,bones were removed to Orchomenus. The whole story is full of miraculous
299,INTRODUCTION,"elements, and the various authorities disagree on numerous points of"
300,INTRODUCTION,"detail. The tradition seems, however, to be constant in declaring that"
301,INTRODUCTION,"Hesiod was murdered and buried at Oenoe, and in this respect it is at"
302,INTRODUCTION,least as old as the time of Thucydides. In conclusion it may be worth
303,INTRODUCTION,"while to add the graceful epigram of Alcaeus of Messene (""Palatine"
304,INTRODUCTION,"Anthology"", vii 55)."
305,INTRODUCTION,
306,INTRODUCTION,"""When in the shady Locrian grove Hesiod lay dead, the Nymphs"
307,INTRODUCTION,"washed his body with water from their own springs, and"
308,INTRODUCTION,heaped high his grave; and thereon the goat-herds sprinkled
309,INTRODUCTION,offerings of milk mingled with yellow-honey: such was the
310,INTRODUCTION,"utterance of the nine Muses that he breathed forth, that old"
311,INTRODUCTION,"man who had tasted of their pure springs."""
312,INTRODUCTION,
313,INTRODUCTION,
314,INTRODUCTION,
315,INTRODUCTION,
316,INTRODUCTION,The Hesiodic Poems
317,INTRODUCTION,
318,INTRODUCTION,The Hesiodic poems fall into two groups according as they are didactic
319,INTRODUCTION,(technical or gnomic) or genealogical: the first group centres round the
320,INTRODUCTION,"""Works and Days"", the second round the ""Theogony""."
321,INTRODUCTION,
322,INTRODUCTION,
323,INTRODUCTION,
324,INTRODUCTION,
325,INTRODUCTION,"I. ""The Works and Days"":"
326,INTRODUCTION,
327,INTRODUCTION,"The poem consists of four main sections. a) After the prelude, which"
328,INTRODUCTION,Pausanias failed to find in the ancient copy engraved on lead seen by
329,INTRODUCTION,"him on Mt. Helicon, comes a general exhortation to industry. It begins"
330,INTRODUCTION,"with the allegory of the two Strifes, who stand for wholesome Emulation"
331,INTRODUCTION,and Quarrelsomeness respectively. Then by means of the Myth of Pandora
332,INTRODUCTION,"the poet shows how evil and the need for work first arose, and goes on"
333,INTRODUCTION,"to describe the Five Ages of the World, tracing the gradual increase in"
334,INTRODUCTION,"evil, and emphasizing the present miserable condition of the world, a"
335,INTRODUCTION,"condition in which struggle is inevitable. Next, after the Fable of the"
336,INTRODUCTION,"Hawk and Nightingale, which serves as a condemnation of violence"
337,INTRODUCTION,"and injustice, the poet passes on to contrast the blessing which"
338,INTRODUCTION,"Righteousness brings to a nation, and the punishment which Heaven"
339,INTRODUCTION,"sends down upon the violent, and the section concludes with a series"
340,INTRODUCTION,of precepts on industry and prudent conduct generally. b) The second
341,INTRODUCTION,section shows how a man may escape want and misery by industry and care
342,INTRODUCTION,"both in agriculture and in trading by sea. Neither subject, it should"
343,INTRODUCTION,"be carefully noted, is treated in any way comprehensively. c) The third"
344,INTRODUCTION,part is occupied with miscellaneous precepts relating mostly to actions
345,INTRODUCTION,of domestic and everyday life and conduct which have little or no
346,INTRODUCTION,connection with one another. d) The final section is taken up with
347,INTRODUCTION,a series of notices on the days of the month which are favourable or
348,INTRODUCTION,unfavourable for agricultural and other operations.
349,INTRODUCTION,
350,INTRODUCTION,It is from the second and fourth sections that the poem takes its name.
351,INTRODUCTION,"At first sight such a work seems to be a miscellany of myths, technical"
352,INTRODUCTION,"advice, moral precepts, and folklore maxims without any unifying"
353,INTRODUCTION,principle; and critics have readily taken the view that the whole is a
354,INTRODUCTION,canto of fragments or short poems worked up by a redactor. Very probably
355,INTRODUCTION,"Hesiod used much material of a far older date, just as Shakespeare"
356,INTRODUCTION,"used the ""Gesta Romanorum"", old chronicles, and old plays; but close"
357,INTRODUCTION,"inspection will show that the ""Works and Days"" has a real unity and that"
358,INTRODUCTION,the picturesque title is somewhat misleading. The poem has properly no
359,INTRODUCTION,"technical object at all, but is moral: its real aim is to show men"
360,INTRODUCTION,how best to live in a difficult world. So viewed the four seemingly
361,INTRODUCTION,independent sections will be found to be linked together in a real bond
362,INTRODUCTION,of unity. Such a connection between the first and second sections is
363,INTRODUCTION,"easily seen, but the links between these and the third and fourth are no"
364,INTRODUCTION,less real: to make life go tolerably smoothly it is most important to
365,INTRODUCTION,be just and to know how to win a livelihood; but happiness also largely
366,INTRODUCTION,"depends on prudence and care both in social and home life as well, and"
367,INTRODUCTION,not least on avoidance of actions which offend supernatural powers and
368,INTRODUCTION,"bring ill-luck. And finally, if your industry is to be fruitful, you"
369,INTRODUCTION,must know what days are suitable for various kinds of work. This
370,INTRODUCTION,moral aim--as opposed to the currently accepted technical aim of the
371,INTRODUCTION,poem--explains the otherwise puzzling incompleteness of the instructions
372,INTRODUCTION,on farming and seafaring.

374,INTRODUCTION,"Of the Hesiodic poems similar in character to the ""Works and Days"", only"
375,INTRODUCTION,"the scantiest fragments survive. One at least of these, the ""Divination"
376,INTRODUCTION,"by Birds"", was, as we know from Proclus, attached to the end of the"
377,INTRODUCTION,"""Works"" until it was rejected by Apollonius Rhodius: doubtless it"
378,INTRODUCTION,"continued the same theme of how to live, showing how man can avoid"
379,INTRODUCTION,disasters by attending to the omens to be drawn from birds. It is
380,INTRODUCTION,"possible that the ""Astronomy"" or ""Astrology"" (as Plutarch calls it) was"
381,INTRODUCTION,"in turn appended to the ""Divination"". It certainly gave some account of"
382,INTRODUCTION,"the principal constellations, their dates of rising and setting, and the"
383,INTRODUCTION,"legends connected with them, and probably showed how these influenced"
384,INTRODUCTION,"human affairs or might be used as guides. The ""Precepts of Chiron"" was"
385,INTRODUCTION,"a didactic poem made up of moral and practical precepts, resembling the"
386,INTRODUCTION,"gnomic sections of the ""Works and Days"", addressed by the Centaur Chiron"
387,INTRODUCTION,to his pupil Achilles.
388,INTRODUCTION,
389,INTRODUCTION,"Even less is known of the poem called the ""Great Works"": the title"
390,INTRODUCTION,implies that it was similar in subject to the second section of the
391,INTRODUCTION,"""Works and Days"", but longer. Possible references in Roman writers"
392,INTRODUCTION,[1106] indicate that among the subjects dealt with were the cultivation
393,INTRODUCTION,of the vine and olive and various herbs. The inclusion of the judgment
394,INTRODUCTION,"of Rhadamanthys (frag. 1): 'If a man sow evil, he shall reap evil,'"
395,INTRODUCTION,"indicates a gnomic element, and the note by Proclus [1107] on ""Works"
396,INTRODUCTION,"and Days"" 126 makes it likely that metals also were dealt with. It is"
397,INTRODUCTION,"therefore possible that another lost poem, the ""Idaean Dactyls"", which"
398,INTRODUCTION,"dealt with the discovery of metals and their working, was appended to,"
399,INTRODUCTION,"or even was a part of the ""Great Works"", just as the ""Divination by"
400,INTRODUCTION,"Birds"" was appended to the ""Works and Days""."

405,INTRODUCTION,II. The Genealogical Poems:
406,INTRODUCTION,
407,INTRODUCTION,"The only complete poem of the genealogical group is the ""Theogony"","
408,INTRODUCTION,which traces from the beginning of things the descent and vicissitudes
409,INTRODUCTION,"of the families of the gods. Like the ""Works and Days"" this poem has no"
410,INTRODUCTION,dramatic plot; but its unifying principle is clear and simple. The gods
411,INTRODUCTION,"are classified chronologically: as soon as one generation is catalogued,"
412,INTRODUCTION,the poet goes on to detail the offspring of each member of that
413,INTRODUCTION,"generation. Exceptions are only made in special cases, as the Sons of"
414,INTRODUCTION,Iapetus (ll. 507-616) whose place is accounted for by their treatment
415,INTRODUCTION,by Zeus. The chief landmarks in the poem are as follows: after the
416,INTRODUCTION,"first 103 lines, which contain at least three distinct preludes,"
417,INTRODUCTION,"three primeval beings are introduced, Chaos, Earth, and Eros--here an"
418,INTRODUCTION,"indefinite reproductive influence. Of these three, Earth produces"
419,INTRODUCTION,"Heaven to whom she bears the Titans, the Cyclopes and the hundred-handed"
420,INTRODUCTION,"giants. The Titans, oppressed by their father, revolt at the instigation"
421,INTRODUCTION,"of Earth, under the leadership of Cronos, and as a result Heaven and"
422,INTRODUCTION,"Earth are separated, and Cronos reigns over the universe. Cronos knowing"
423,INTRODUCTION,"that he is destined to be overcome by one of his children, swallows each"
424,INTRODUCTION,"one of them as they are born, until Zeus, saved by Rhea, grows up and"
425,INTRODUCTION,overcomes Cronos in some struggle which is not described. Cronos is
426,INTRODUCTION,"forced to vomit up the children he had swallowed, and these with Zeus"
427,INTRODUCTION,"divide the universe between them, like a human estate. Two events mark"
428,INTRODUCTION,"the early reign of Zeus, the war with the Titans and the overthrow of"
429,INTRODUCTION,"Typhoeus, and as Zeus is still reigning the poet can only go on to give"
430,INTRODUCTION,a list of gods born to Zeus by various goddesses. After this he formally
431,INTRODUCTION,bids farewell to the cosmic and Olympian deities and enumerates the sons
432,INTRODUCTION,born of goddess to mortals. The poem closes with an invocation of the
433,INTRODUCTION,Muses to sing of the 'tribe of women'.
434,INTRODUCTION,
435,INTRODUCTION,"This conclusion served to link the ""Theogony"" to what must have been"
436,INTRODUCTION,"a distinct poem, the ""Catalogues of Women"". This work was divided into"
437,INTRODUCTION,"four (Suidas says five) books, the last one (or two) of which was known"
438,INTRODUCTION,"as the ""Eoiae"" and may have been again a distinct poem: the curious"
439,INTRODUCTION,"title will be explained presently. The ""Catalogues"" proper were a series"
440,INTRODUCTION,of genealogies which traced the Hellenic race (or its more important
441,INTRODUCTION,peoples and families) from a common ancestor. The reason why women are
442,INTRODUCTION,so prominent is obvious: since most families and tribes claimed to be
443,INTRODUCTION,"descended from a god, the only safe clue to their origin was through a"
444,INTRODUCTION,mortal woman beloved by that god; and it has also been pointed out that
445,INTRODUCTION,'mutterrecht' still left its traces in northern Greece in historical
446,INTRODUCTION,times.
447,INTRODUCTION,
448,INTRODUCTION,The following analysis (after Marckscheffel) [1108] will show the
449,INTRODUCTION,principle of its composition. From Prometheus and Pronoia sprang
450,INTRODUCTION,"Deucalion and Pyrrha, the only survivors of the deluge, who had a son"
451,INTRODUCTION,"Hellen (frag. 1), the reputed ancestor of the whole Hellenic race. From"
452,INTRODUCTION,"the daughters of Deucalion sprang Magnes and Macedon, ancestors of the"
453,INTRODUCTION,"Magnesians and Macedonians, who are thus represented as cousins to the"
454,INTRODUCTION,"true Hellenic stock. Hellen had three sons, Dorus, Xuthus, and Aeolus,"
455,INTRODUCTION,"parents of the Dorian, Ionic and Aeolian races, and the offspring"
456,INTRODUCTION,of these was then detailed. In one instance a considerable and
457,INTRODUCTION,characteristic section can be traced from extant fragments and notices:
458,INTRODUCTION,"Salmoneus, son of Aeolus, had a daughter Tyro who bore to Poseidon two"
459,INTRODUCTION,"sons, Pelias and Neleus; the latter of these, king of Pylos, refused"
460,INTRODUCTION,"Heracles purification for the murder of Iphitus, whereupon Heracles"
461,INTRODUCTION,"attacked and sacked Pylos, killing amongst the other sons of Neleus"
462,INTRODUCTION,"Periclymenus, who had the power of changing himself into all manner of"
463,INTRODUCTION,"shapes. From this slaughter Neleus alone escaped (frags. 13, and"
464,INTRODUCTION,10-12). This summary shows the general principle of arrangement of the
465,INTRODUCTION,"""Catalogues"": each line seems to have been dealt with in turn, and the"
466,INTRODUCTION,monotony was relieved as far as possible by a brief relation of famous
467,INTRODUCTION,adventures connected with any of the personages--as in the case of
468,INTRODUCTION,Atalanta and Hippomenes (frag. 14). Similarly the story of the Argonauts
469,INTRODUCTION,appears from the fragments (37-42) to have been told in some detail.
470,INTRODUCTION,
471,INTRODUCTION,This tendency to introduce romantic episodes led to an important
472,INTRODUCTION,"development. Several poems are ascribed to Hesiod, such as the"
473,INTRODUCTION,"""Epithalamium of Peleus and Thetis"", the ""Descent of Theseus into"
474,INTRODUCTION,"Hades"", or the ""Circuit of the Earth"" (which must have been"
475,INTRODUCTION,"connected with the story of Phineus and the Harpies, and so with the"
476,INTRODUCTION,"Argonaut-legend), which yet seem to have belonged to the ""Catalogues""."
477,INTRODUCTION,It is highly probable that these poems were interpolations into the
478,INTRODUCTION,"""Catalogues"" expanded by later poets from more summary notices in the"
479,INTRODUCTION,genuine Hesiodic work and subsequently detached from their contexts
480,INTRODUCTION,and treated as independent. This is definitely known to be true of the
481,INTRODUCTION,"""Shield of Heracles"", the first 53 lines of which belong to the"
482,INTRODUCTION,"fourth book of the ""Catalogues"", and almost certainly applies to other"
483,INTRODUCTION,"episodes, such as the ""Suitors of Helen"" [1109], the ""Daughters of"
484,INTRODUCTION,"Leucippus"", and the ""Marriage of Ceyx"", which last Plutarch mentions as"
485,INTRODUCTION,'interpolated in the works of Hesiod.'
486,INTRODUCTION,
487,INTRODUCTION,"To the ""Catalogues"", as we have said, was appended another work, the"
488,INTRODUCTION,"""Eoiae"". The title seems to have arisen in the following way [1110]:"
489,INTRODUCTION,"the ""Catalogues"" probably ended (ep. ""Theogony"" 963 ff.) with some such"
490,INTRODUCTION,"passage as this: 'But now, ye Muses, sing of the tribes of women with"
491,INTRODUCTION,"whom the Sons of Heaven were joined in love, women pre-eminent above"
492,INTRODUCTION,"their fellows in beauty, such as was Niobe (?).' Each succeeding heroine"
493,INTRODUCTION,"was then introduced by the formula 'Or such as was...' (cp. frags. 88,"
494,INTRODUCTION,"92, etc.). A large fragment of the ""Eoiae"" is extant at the beginning of"
495,INTRODUCTION,"the ""Shield of Heracles"", which may be mentioned here. The ""supplement"""
496,INTRODUCTION,"(ll. 57-480) is nominally Heracles and Cycnus, but the greater part"
497,INTRODUCTION,"is taken up with an inferior description of the shield of Heracles, in"
498,INTRODUCTION,"imitation of the Homeric shield of Achilles (""Iliad"" xviii. 478 ff.)."
499,INTRODUCTION,Nothing shows more clearly the collapse of the principles of the
500,INTRODUCTION,Hesiodic school than this ultimate servile dependence upon Homeric
501,INTRODUCTION,models.
502,INTRODUCTION,
503,INTRODUCTION,"At the close of the ""Shield"" Heracles goes on to Trachis to the house"
504,INTRODUCTION,"of Ceyx, and this warning suggests that the ""Marriage of Ceyx"" may have"
505,INTRODUCTION,"come immediately after the 'Or such as was' of Alcmena in the ""Eoiae"":"
506,INTRODUCTION,"possibly Halcyone, the wife of Ceyx, was one of the heroines sung in"
507,INTRODUCTION,"the poem, and the original section was 'developed' into the ""Marriage"","
508,INTRODUCTION,although what form the poem took is unknown.
509,INTRODUCTION,
510,INTRODUCTION,"Next to the ""Eoiae"" and the poems which seemed to have been developed"
511,INTRODUCTION,"from it, it is natural to place the ""Great Eoiae"". This, again, as we"
512,INTRODUCTION,"know from fragments, was a list of heroines who bare children to the"
513,INTRODUCTION,gods: from the title we must suppose it to have been much longer that
514,INTRODUCTION,"the simple ""Eoiae"", but its extent is unknown. Lehmann, remarking that"
515,INTRODUCTION,the heroines are all Boeotian and Thessalian (while the heroines of
516,INTRODUCTION,"the ""Catalogues"" belong to all parts of the Greek world), believes the"
517,INTRODUCTION,author to have been either a Boeotian or Thessalian.
518,INTRODUCTION,
519,INTRODUCTION,"Two other poems are ascribed to Hesiod. Of these the ""Aegimius"" (also"
520,INTRODUCTION,"ascribed by Athenaeus to Cercops of Miletus), is thought by Valckenaer"
521,INTRODUCTION,to deal with the war of Aegimus against the Lapithae and the aid
522,INTRODUCTION,"furnished to him by Heracles, and with the history of Aegimius and"
523,INTRODUCTION,his sons. Otto Muller suggests that the introduction of Thetis and of
524,INTRODUCTION,Phrixus (frags. 1-2) is to be connected with notices of the allies of
525,INTRODUCTION,"the Lapithae from Phthiotis and Iolchus, and that the story of Io was"
526,INTRODUCTION,incidental to a narrative of Heracles' expedition against Euboea. The
527,INTRODUCTION,"remaining poem, the ""Melampodia"", was a work in three books, whose plan"
528,INTRODUCTION,"it is impossible to recover. Its subject, however, seems to have been"
529,INTRODUCTION,"the histories of famous seers like Mopsus, Calchas, and Teiresias, and"
530,INTRODUCTION,"it probably took its name from Melampus, the most famous of them all."
531,INTRODUCTION,

533,INTRODUCTION,
534,INTRODUCTION,
535,INTRODUCTION,Date of the Hesiodic Poems
536,INTRODUCTION,
537,INTRODUCTION,"There is no doubt that the ""Works and Days"" is the oldest, as it is the"
538,INTRODUCTION,"most original, of the Hesiodic poems. It seems to be distinctly earlier"
539,INTRODUCTION,"than the ""Theogony"", which refers to it, apparently, as a poem already"
540,INTRODUCTION,renowned. Two considerations help us to fix a relative date for the
541,INTRODUCTION,"""Works"". 1) In diction, dialect and style it is obviously dependent"
542,INTRODUCTION,"upon Homer, and is therefore considerably later than the ""Iliad"" and"
543,INTRODUCTION,"""Odyssey"": moreover, as we have seen, it is in revolt against the"
544,INTRODUCTION,"romantic school, already grown decadent, and while the digamma is still"
545,INTRODUCTION,"living, it is obviously growing weak, and is by no means uniformly"
546,INTRODUCTION,effective.
547,INTRODUCTION,
548,INTRODUCTION,2) On the other hand while tradition steadily puts the Cyclic poets
549,INTRODUCTION,"at various dates from 776 B.C. downwards, it is equally consistent in"
550,INTRODUCTION,regarding Homer and Hesiod as 'prehistoric'. Herodotus indeed puts both
551,INTRODUCTION,"poets 400 years before his own time; that is, at about 830-820 B.C., and"
552,INTRODUCTION,the evidence stated above points to the middle of the ninth century
553,INTRODUCTION,"as the probable date for the ""Works and Days"". The ""Theogony"" might be"
554,INTRODUCTION,"tentatively placed a century later; and the ""Catalogues"" and ""Eoiae"" are"
555,INTRODUCTION,"again later, but not greatly later, than the ""Theogony"": the ""Shield of"
556,INTRODUCTION,"Heracles"" may be ascribed to the later half of the seventh century, but"
557,INTRODUCTION,there is not evidence enough to show whether the other 'developed' poems
558,INTRODUCTION,are to be regarded as of a date so low as this.
559,INTRODUCTION,
560,INTRODUCTION,
561,INTRODUCTION,
562,INTRODUCTION,
563,INTRODUCTION,Literary Value of Homer
564,INTRODUCTION,
565,INTRODUCTION,Quintillian's [1111] judgment on Hesiod that 'he rarely rises to great
566,INTRODUCTION,heights... and to him is given the palm in the middle-class of speech'
567,INTRODUCTION,"is just, but is liable to give a wrong impression. Hesiod has nothing"
568,INTRODUCTION,"that remotely approaches such scenes as that between Priam and Achilles,"
569,INTRODUCTION,"or the pathos of Andromache's preparations for Hector's return, even as"
570,INTRODUCTION,he was falling before the walls of Troy; but in matters that come
571,INTRODUCTION,"within the range of ordinary experience, he rarely fails to rise to the"
572,INTRODUCTION,"appropriate level. Take, for instance, the description of the Iron"
573,INTRODUCTION,"Age (""Works and Days"", 182 ff.) with its catalogue of wrongdoings and"
574,INTRODUCTION,violence ever increasing until Aidos and Nemesis are forced to leave
575,INTRODUCTION,mankind who thenceforward shall have 'no remedy against evil'. Such
576,INTRODUCTION,"occasions, however, rarely occur and are perhaps not characteristic of"
577,INTRODUCTION,"Hesiod's genius: if we would see Hesiod at his best, in his most natural"
578,INTRODUCTION,"vein, we must turn to such a passage as that which he himself--according"
579,INTRODUCTION,"to the compiler of the ""Contest of Hesiod and Homer""--selected as best"
580,INTRODUCTION,"in all his work, 'When the Pleiades, Atlas' daughters, begin to rise...'"
581,INTRODUCTION,"(""Works and Days,"" 383 ff.). The value of such a passage cannot be"
582,INTRODUCTION,"analysed: it can only be said that given such a subject, this alone is"
583,INTRODUCTION,the right method of treatment.
584,INTRODUCTION,
585,INTRODUCTION,"Hesiod's diction is in the main Homeric, but one of his charms is the"
586,INTRODUCTION,"use of quaint allusive phrases derived, perhaps, from a pre-Hesiodic"
587,INTRODUCTION,peasant poetry: thus the season when Boreas blows is the time when 'the
588,INTRODUCTION,Boneless One gnaws his foot by his fireless hearth in his cheerless
589,INTRODUCTION,house'; to cut one's nails is 'to sever the withered from the quick
590,INTRODUCTION,upon that which has five branches'; similarly the burglar is the
591,INTRODUCTION,"'day-sleeper', and the serpent is the 'hairless one'. Very similar is"
592,INTRODUCTION,his reference to seasons through what happens or is done in that season:
593,INTRODUCTION,"'when the House-carrier, fleeing the Pleiades, climbs up the plants from"
594,INTRODUCTION,"the earth', is the season for harvesting; or 'when the artichoke flowers"
595,INTRODUCTION,"and the clicking grass-hopper, seated in a tree, pours down his shrill"
596,INTRODUCTION,"song', is the time for rest."
597,INTRODUCTION,
598,INTRODUCTION,"Hesiod's charm lies in his child-like and sincere naivete, in his"
599,INTRODUCTION,unaffected interest in and picturesque view of nature and all that
600,INTRODUCTION,"happens in nature. These qualities, it is true, are those pre-eminently"
601,INTRODUCTION,"of the ""Works and Days"": the literary values of the ""Theogony"" are of a"
602,INTRODUCTION,"more technical character, skill in ordering and disposing long lists of"
603,INTRODUCTION,"names, sure judgment in seasoning a monotonous subject with marvellous"
604,INTRODUCTION,"incidents or episodes, and no mean imagination in depicting the awful,"
605,INTRODUCTION,as is shown in the description of Tartarus (ll. 736-745). Yet it remains
606,INTRODUCTION,true that Hesiod's distinctive title to a high place in Greek literature
607,INTRODUCTION,"lies in the very fact of his freedom from classic form, and his grave,"
608,INTRODUCTION,"and yet child-like, outlook upon his world."
609,INTRODUCTION,
610,INTRODUCTION,
611,INTRODUCTION,
612,INTRODUCTION,
613,INTRODUCTION,The Ionic School
614,INTRODUCTION,
615,INTRODUCTION,"The Ionic School of Epic poetry was, as we have seen, dominated by"
616,INTRODUCTION,"the Homeric tradition, and while the style and method of treatment are"
617,INTRODUCTION,"Homeric, it is natural that the Ionic poets refrained from cultivating"
618,INTRODUCTION,"the ground tilled by Homer, and chose for treatment legends which lay"
619,INTRODUCTION,"beyond the range of the ""Iliad"" and ""Odyssey"". Equally natural it is"
620,INTRODUCTION,that they should have particularly selected various phases of the
621,INTRODUCTION,"tale of Troy which preceded or followed the action of the ""Iliad"" or"
622,INTRODUCTION,"""Odyssey"". In this way, without any preconceived intention, a body of"
623,INTRODUCTION,epic poetry was built up by various writers which covered the whole
624,INTRODUCTION,Trojan story. But the entire range of heroic legend was open to these
625,INTRODUCTION,"poets, and other clusters of epics grew up dealing particularly with the"
626,INTRODUCTION,"famous story of Thebes, while others dealt with the beginnings of the"
627,INTRODUCTION,world and the wars of heaven. In the end there existed a kind of epic
628,INTRODUCTION,"history of the world, as known to the Greeks, down to the death of"
629,INTRODUCTION,"Odysseus, when the heroic age ended. In the Alexandrian Age these"
630,INTRODUCTION,"poems were arranged in chronological order, apparently by Zenodotus of"
631,INTRODUCTION,"Ephesus, at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. At a later time the"
632,INTRODUCTION,"term ""Cycle"", 'round' or 'course', was given to this collection."
633,INTRODUCTION,
634,INTRODUCTION,Of all this mass of epic poetry only the scantiest fragments survive;
635,INTRODUCTION,but happily Photius has preserved to us an abridgment of the synopsis
636,INTRODUCTION,"made of each poem of the ""Trojan Cycle"" by Proclus, i.e. Eutychius"
637,INTRODUCTION,Proclus of Sicca.
638,INTRODUCTION,
639,INTRODUCTION,The pre-Trojan poems of the Cycle may be noticed first. The
640,INTRODUCTION,"""Titanomachy"", ascribed both to Eumelus of Corinth and to Arctinus of"
641,INTRODUCTION,"Miletus, began with a kind of Theogony which told of the union of Heaven"
642,INTRODUCTION,and Earth and of their offspring the Cyclopes and the Hundred-handed
643,INTRODUCTION,"Giants. How the poem proceeded we have no means of knowing, but we may"
644,INTRODUCTION,suppose that in character it was not unlike the short account of the
645,INTRODUCTION,"Titan War found in the Hesiodic ""Theogony"" (617 ff.)."
646,INTRODUCTION,
647,INTRODUCTION,"What links bound the ""Titanomachy"" to the Theben Cycle is not clear."
648,INTRODUCTION,"This latter group was formed of three poems, the ""Story of Oedipus"", the"
649,INTRODUCTION,"""Thebais"", and the ""Epigoni"". Of the ""Oedipodea"" practically nothing is"
650,INTRODUCTION,"known, though on the assurance of Athenaeus (vii. 277 E) that Sophocles"
651,INTRODUCTION,"followed the Epic Cycle closely in the plots of his plays, we may"
652,INTRODUCTION,suppose that in outline the story corresponded closely to the history of
653,INTRODUCTION,"Oedipus as it is found in the ""Oedipus Tyrannus"". The ""Thebais"" seems"
654,INTRODUCTION,to have begun with the origin of the fatal quarrel between Eteocles and
655,INTRODUCTION,Polyneices in the curse called down upon them by their father in his
656,INTRODUCTION,misery. The story was thence carried down to the end of the expedition
657,INTRODUCTION,"under Polyneices, Adrastus and Amphiarus against Thebes. The ""Epigoni"""
658,INTRODUCTION,(ascribed to Antimachus of Teos) recounted the expedition of the
659,INTRODUCTION,"'After-Born' against Thebes, and the sack of the city."
660,INTRODUCTION,
661,INTRODUCTION,
662,INTRODUCTION,
663,INTRODUCTION,
664,INTRODUCTION,The Trojan Cycle
665,INTRODUCTION,
666,INTRODUCTION,"Six epics with the ""Iliad"" and the ""Odyssey"" made up the Trojan"
667,INTRODUCTION,"Cycle--The ""Cyprian Lays"", the ""Iliad"", the ""Aethiopis"", the ""Little"
668,INTRODUCTION,"Iliad"", the ""Sack of Troy"", the ""Returns"", the ""Odyssey"", and the"
669,INTRODUCTION,"""Telegony""."
670,INTRODUCTION,
671,INTRODUCTION,It has been assumed in the foregoing pages that the poems of the Trojan
672,INTRODUCTION,"Cycle are later than the Homeric poems; but, as the opposite view"
673,INTRODUCTION,"has been held, the reasons for this assumption must now be given. 1)"
674,INTRODUCTION,Tradition puts Homer and the Homeric poems proper back in the ages
675,INTRODUCTION,"before chronological history began, and at the same time assigns the"
676,INTRODUCTION,purely Cyclic poems to definite authors who are dated from the
677,INTRODUCTION,first Olympiad (776 B.C.) downwards. This tradition cannot be purely
678,INTRODUCTION,arbitrary. 2) The Cyclic poets (as we can see from the abstract of
679,INTRODUCTION,Proclus) were careful not to trespass upon ground already occupied by
680,INTRODUCTION,"Homer. Thus, when we find that in the ""Returns"" all the prominent Greek"
681,INTRODUCTION,"heroes except Odysseus are accounted for, we are forced to believe that"
682,INTRODUCTION,"the author of this poem knew the ""Odyssey"" and judged it unnecessary to"
683,INTRODUCTION,"deal in full with that hero's adventures. [1112] In a word, the Cyclic"
684,INTRODUCTION,"poems are 'written round' the ""Iliad"" and the ""Odyssey"". 3) The general"
685,INTRODUCTION,"structure of these epics is clearly imitative. As M.M. Croiset remark,"
686,INTRODUCTION,"the abusive Thersites in the ""Aethiopis"" is clearly copied from the"
687,INTRODUCTION,"Thersites of the ""Iliad""; in the same poem Antilochus, slain by Memnon"
688,INTRODUCTION,"and avenged by Achilles, is obviously modelled on Patroclus. 4) The"
689,INTRODUCTION,"geographical knowledge of a poem like the ""Returns"" is far wider and"
690,INTRODUCTION,"more precise than that of the ""Odyssey"". 5) Moreover, in the Cyclic"
691,INTRODUCTION,poems epic is clearly degenerating morally--if the expression may be
692,INTRODUCTION,"used. The chief greatness of the ""Iliad"" is in the character of the"
693,INTRODUCTION,heroes Achilles and Hector rather than in the actual events which take
694,INTRODUCTION,place: in the Cyclic writers facts rather than character are the objects
695,INTRODUCTION,"of interest, and events are so packed together as to leave no space for"
696,INTRODUCTION,any exhibition of the play of moral forces. All these reasons justify
697,INTRODUCTION,the view that the poems with which we now have to deal were later than
698,INTRODUCTION,"the ""Iliad"" and ""Odyssey"", and if we must recognize the possibility of"
699,INTRODUCTION,"some conventionality in the received dating, we may feel confident that"
700,INTRODUCTION,it is at least approximately just.
701,INTRODUCTION,
702,INTRODUCTION,The earliest of the post-Homeric epics of Troy are apparently the
703,INTRODUCTION,"""Aethiopis"" and the ""Sack of Ilium"", both ascribed to Arctinus of"
704,INTRODUCTION,Miletus who is said to have flourished in the first Olympiad (776 B.C.).
705,INTRODUCTION,"He set himself to finish the tale of Troy, which, so far as events were"
706,INTRODUCTION,"concerned, had been left half-told by Homer, by tracing the course of"
707,INTRODUCTION,"events after the close of the ""Iliad"". The ""Aethiopis"" thus included the"
708,INTRODUCTION,coming of the Amazon Penthesilea to help the Trojans after the fall of
709,INTRODUCTION,"Hector and her death, the similar arrival and fall of the Aethiopian"
710,INTRODUCTION,"Memnon, the death of Achilles under the arrow of Paris, and the dispute"
711,INTRODUCTION,"between Odysseus and Aias for the arms of Achilles. The ""Sack of Ilium"""
712,INTRODUCTION,[1113] as analysed by Proclus was very similar to Vergil's version in
713,INTRODUCTION,"""Aeneid"" ii, comprising the episodes of the wooden horse, of Laocoon, of"
714,INTRODUCTION,"Sinon, the return of the Achaeans from Tenedos, the actual Sack of Troy,"
715,INTRODUCTION,the division of spoils and the burning of the city.
716,INTRODUCTION,
717,INTRODUCTION,Lesches or Lescheos (as Pausanias calls him) of Pyrrha or Mitylene is
718,INTRODUCTION,"dated at about 660 B.C. In his ""Little Iliad"" he undertook to elaborate"
719,INTRODUCTION,"the ""Sack"" as related by Arctinus. His work included the adjudgment of"
720,INTRODUCTION,"the arms of Achilles to Odysseus, the madness of Aias, the bringing"

723,INTRODUCTION,"wooden horse, the spying of Odysseus and his theft, along with Diomedes,"
724,INTRODUCTION,of the Palladium: the analysis concludes with the admission of the
725,INTRODUCTION,"wooden horse into Troy by the Trojans. It is known, however (Aristotle,"
726,INTRODUCTION,"""Poetics"", xxiii; Pausanias, x, 25-27), that the ""Little Iliad"" also"
727,INTRODUCTION,contained a description of the sack of Troy. It is probable that this
728,INTRODUCTION,and other superfluous incidents disappeared after the Alexandrian
729,INTRODUCTION,"arrangement of the poems in the Cycle, either as the result of some"
730,INTRODUCTION,"later recension, or merely through disuse. Or Proclus may have thought"
731,INTRODUCTION,it unnecessary to give the accounts by Lesches and Arctinus of the same
732,INTRODUCTION,incident.
733,INTRODUCTION,
734,INTRODUCTION,"The ""Cyprian Lays"", ascribed to Stasinus of Cyprus [1114] (but also to"
735,INTRODUCTION,Hegesinus of Salamis) was designed to do for the events preceding the
736,INTRODUCTION,"action of the ""Iliad"" what Arctinus had done for the later phases of the"
737,INTRODUCTION,"Trojan War. The ""Cypria"" begins with the first causes of the war, the"
738,INTRODUCTION,"purpose of Zeus to relieve the overburdened earth, the apple of"
739,INTRODUCTION,"discord, the rape of Helen. Then follow the incidents connected with the"
740,INTRODUCTION,gathering of the Achaeans and their ultimate landing in Troy; and the
741,INTRODUCTION,story of the war is detailed up to the quarrel between Achilles and
742,INTRODUCTION,"Agamemnon with which the ""Iliad"" begins."
743,INTRODUCTION,
744,INTRODUCTION,"These four poems rounded off the story of the ""Iliad"", and it only"
745,INTRODUCTION,"remained to connect this enlarged version with the ""Odyssey"". This was"
746,INTRODUCTION,"done by means of the ""Returns"", a poem in five books ascribed to Agias"
747,INTRODUCTION,"or Hegias of Troezen, which begins where the ""Sack of Troy"" ends. It"
748,INTRODUCTION,"told of the dispute between Agamemnon and Menelaus, the departure from"
749,INTRODUCTION,"Troy of Menelaus, the fortunes of the lesser heroes, the return and"
750,INTRODUCTION,"tragic death of Agamemnon, and the vengeance of Orestes on Aegisthus."
751,INTRODUCTION,"The story ends with the return home of Menelaus, which brings the"
752,INTRODUCTION,"general narrative up to the beginning of the ""Odyssey""."
753,INTRODUCTION,
754,INTRODUCTION,"But the ""Odyssey"" itself left much untold: what, for example, happened"
755,INTRODUCTION,"in Ithaca after the slaying of the suitors, and what was the ultimate"
756,INTRODUCTION,fate of Odysseus? The answer to these questions was supplied by the
757,INTRODUCTION,"""Telegony"", a poem in two books by Eugammon of Cyrene (fl. 568 B.C.)."
758,INTRODUCTION,It told of the adventures of Odysseus in Thesprotis after the killing
759,INTRODUCTION,"of the Suitors, of his return to Ithaca, and his death at the hands"
760,INTRODUCTION,"of Telegonus, his son by Circe. The epic ended by disposing of the"
761,INTRODUCTION,"surviving personages in a double marriage, Telemachus wedding Circe, and"
762,INTRODUCTION,Telegonus Penelope.
763,INTRODUCTION,
764,INTRODUCTION,The end of the Cycle marks also the end of the Heroic Age.

767,INTRODUCTION,
768,INTRODUCTION,
769,INTRODUCTION,The Homeric Hymns
770,INTRODUCTION,
771,INTRODUCTION,"The collection of thirty-three Hymns, ascribed to Homer, is the last"
772,INTRODUCTION,"considerable work of the Epic School, and seems, on the whole, to be"
773,INTRODUCTION,later than the Cyclic poems. It cannot be definitely assigned either
774,INTRODUCTION,"to the Ionian or Continental schools, for while the romantic element is"
775,INTRODUCTION,"very strong, there is a distinct genealogical interest; and in matters"
776,INTRODUCTION,of diction and style the influences of both Hesiod and Homer are
777,INTRODUCTION,well-marked. The date of the formation of the collection as such is
778,INTRODUCTION,unknown. Diodorus Siculus (temp. Augustus) is the first to mention
779,INTRODUCTION,"such a body of poetry, and it is likely enough that this is, at least"
780,INTRODUCTION,"substantially, the one which has come down to us. Thucydides quotes the"
781,INTRODUCTION,"Delian ""Hymn to Apollo"", and it is possible that the Homeric corpus of"
782,INTRODUCTION,his day also contained other of the more important hymns. Conceivably
783,INTRODUCTION,the collection was arranged in the Alexandrine period.
784,INTRODUCTION,
785,INTRODUCTION,"Thucydides, in quoting the ""Hymn to Apollo"", calls it PROOIMION, which"
786,INTRODUCTION,ordinarily means a 'prelude' chanted by a rhapsode before recitation of
787,INTRODUCTION,"a lay from Homer, and such hymns as Nos. vi, xxxi, xxxii, are"
788,INTRODUCTION,"clearly preludes in the strict sense; in No. xxxi, for example, after"
789,INTRODUCTION,"celebrating Helios, the poet declares he will next sing of the 'race of"
790,INTRODUCTION,"mortal men, the demi-gods'. But it may fairly be doubted whether"
791,INTRODUCTION,"such Hymns as those to ""Demeter"" (ii), ""Apollo"" (iii), ""Hermes"" (iv),"
792,INTRODUCTION,"""Aphrodite"" (v), can have been real preludes, in spite of the closing"
793,INTRODUCTION,formula 'and now I will pass on to another hymn'. The view taken by
794,INTRODUCTION,"Allen and Sikes, amongst other scholars, is doubtless right, that"
795,INTRODUCTION,these longer hymns are only technically preludes and show to what
796,INTRODUCTION,disproportionate lengths a simple literacy form can be developed.
797,INTRODUCTION,
798,INTRODUCTION,"The Hymns to ""Pan"" (xix), to ""Dionysus"" (xxvi), to ""Hestia and Hermes"""
799,INTRODUCTION,"(xxix), seem to have been designed for use at definite religious"
800,INTRODUCTION,"festivals, apart from recitations. With the exception perhaps of the"
801,INTRODUCTION,"""Hymn to Ares"" (viii), no item in the collection can be regarded as"
802,INTRODUCTION,either devotional or liturgical.
803,INTRODUCTION,
804,INTRODUCTION,The Hymn is doubtless a very ancient form; but if no example of extreme
805,INTRODUCTION,antiquity survive this must be put down to the fact that until the age
806,INTRODUCTION,"of literary consciousness, such things are not preserved."
807,INTRODUCTION,
808,INTRODUCTION,"First, apparently, in the collection stood the ""Hymn to Dionysus"", of"
809,INTRODUCTION,which only two fragments now survive. While it appears to have been a
810,INTRODUCTION,"hymn of the longer type [1115], we have no evidence to show either its"
811,INTRODUCTION,scope or date.
812,INTRODUCTION,
813,INTRODUCTION,"The ""Hymn to Demeter"", extant only in the MS. discovered by Matthiae"
814,INTRODUCTION,"at Moscow, describes the seizure of Persephone by Hades, the grief"
815,INTRODUCTION,"of Demeter, her stay at Eleusis, and her vengeance on gods and men by"
816,INTRODUCTION,causing famine. In the end Zeus is forced to bring Persephone back from
817,INTRODUCTION,"the lower world; but the goddess, by the contriving of Hades, still"
818,INTRODUCTION,remains partly a deity of the lower world. In memory of her sorrows
819,INTRODUCTION,"Demeter establishes the Eleusinian mysteries (which, however, were"
820,INTRODUCTION,purely agrarian in origin).
821,INTRODUCTION,
822,INTRODUCTION,"This hymn, as a literary work, is one of the finest in the collection."
823,INTRODUCTION,It is surely Attic or Eleusinian in origin. Can we in any way fix its
824,INTRODUCTION,"date? Firstly, it is certainly not later than the beginning of the sixth"
825,INTRODUCTION,"century, for it makes no mention of Iacchus, and the Dionysiac"
826,INTRODUCTION,"element was introduced at Eleusis at about that period. Further,"
827,INTRODUCTION,the insignificance of Triptolemus and Eumolpus point to considerable
828,INTRODUCTION,"antiquity, and the digamma is still active. All these considerations"
829,INTRODUCTION,point to the seventh century as the probable date of the hymn.
830,INTRODUCTION,
831,INTRODUCTION,"The ""Hymn to Apollo"" consists of two parts, which beyond any doubt were"
832,INTRODUCTION,"originally distinct, a Delian hymn and a Pythian hymn."
833,INTRODUCTION,
834,INTRODUCTION,"The Delian hymn describes how Leto, in travail with Apollo, sought out"
835,INTRODUCTION,"a place in which to bear her son, and how Apollo, born in Delos, at once"
836,INTRODUCTION,"claimed for himself the lyre, the bow, and prophecy. This part of the"
837,INTRODUCTION,existing hymn ends with an encomium of the Delian festival of Apollo and
838,INTRODUCTION,of the Delian choirs. The second part celebrates the founding of Pytho
839,INTRODUCTION,(Delphi) as the oracular seat of Apollo. After various wanderings the
840,INTRODUCTION,"god comes to Telphus, near Haliartus, but is dissuaded by the nymph of"
841,INTRODUCTION,"the place from settling there and urged to go on to Pytho where, after"
842,INTRODUCTION,"slaying the she-dragon who nursed Typhaon, he builds his temple. After"
843,INTRODUCTION,the punishment of Telphusa for her deceit in giving him no warning of
844,INTRODUCTION,"the dragoness at Pytho, Apollo, in the form of a dolphin, brings certain"
845,INTRODUCTION,Cretan shipmen to Delphi to be his priests; and the hymn ends with a
846,INTRODUCTION,charge to these men to behave orderly and righteously.
847,INTRODUCTION,
848,INTRODUCTION,The Delian part is exclusively Ionian and insular both in style and
849,INTRODUCTION,sympathy; Delos and no other is Apollo's chosen seat: but the second
850,INTRODUCTION,part is as definitely continental; Delos is ignored and Delphi alone is
851,INTRODUCTION,the important centre of Apollo's worship. From this it is clear that
852,INTRODUCTION,"the two parts need not be of one date--The first, indeed, is ascribed"
853,INTRODUCTION,"(Scholiast on Pindar ""Nem"". ii, 2) to Cynaethus of Chios (fl. 504 B.C.),"
854,INTRODUCTION,a date which is obviously far too low; general considerations point
855,INTRODUCTION,rather to the eighth century. The second part is not later than 600
856,INTRODUCTION,"B.C.; for 1) the chariot-races at Pytho, which commenced in 586 B.C.,"
857,INTRODUCTION,"are unknown to the writer of the hymn, 2) the temple built by Trophonius"
858,INTRODUCTION,and Agamedes for Apollo (ll. 294-299) seems to have been still standing
859,INTRODUCTION,"when the hymn was written, and this temple was burned in 548. We may at"
860,INTRODUCTION,"least be sure that the first part is a Chian work, and that the second"
861,INTRODUCTION,was composed by a continental poet familiar with Delphi.
862,INTRODUCTION,
863,INTRODUCTION,"The ""Hymn to Hermes"" differs from others in its burlesque, quasi-comic"
864,INTRODUCTION,"character, and it is also the best-known of the Hymns to English readers"
865,INTRODUCTION,in consequence of Shelley's translation.
866,INTRODUCTION,
867,INTRODUCTION,"After a brief narrative of the birth of Hermes, the author goes on to"
868,INTRODUCTION,show how he won a place among the gods. First the new-born child found a
869,INTRODUCTION,"tortoise and from its shell contrived the lyre; next, with much cunning"
870,INTRODUCTION,"circumstance, he stole Apollo's cattle and, when charged with the theft"
871,INTRODUCTION,"by Apollo, forced that god to appear in undignified guise before the"
872,INTRODUCTION,"tribunal of Zeus. Zeus seeks to reconcile the pair, and Hermes by"
873,INTRODUCTION,the gift of the lyre wins Apollo's friendship and purchases various
874,INTRODUCTION,"prerogatives, a share in divination, the lordship of herds and animals,"
875,INTRODUCTION,and the office of messenger from the gods to Hades.
876,INTRODUCTION,
877,INTRODUCTION,The Hymn is hard to date. Hermes' lyre has seven strings and the
878,INTRODUCTION,invention of the seven-stringed lyre is ascribed to Terpander (flor.
879,INTRODUCTION,"676 B.C.). The hymn must therefore be later than that date, though"
880,INTRODUCTION,"Terpander, according to Weir Smyth [1116], may have only modified the"
881,INTRODUCTION,scale of the lyre; yet while the burlesque character precludes an early
882,INTRODUCTION,"date, this feature is far removed, as Allen and Sikes remark, from the"
883,INTRODUCTION,"silliness of the ""Battle of the Frogs and Mice"", so that a date in the"
884,INTRODUCTION,earlier part of the sixth century is most probable.
885,INTRODUCTION,
886,INTRODUCTION,"The ""Hymn to Aphrodite"" is not the least remarkable, from a literary"
887,INTRODUCTION,"point of view, of the whole collection, exhibiting as it does in"
888,INTRODUCTION,a masterly manner a divine being as the unwilling victim of an
889,INTRODUCTION,"irresistible force. It tells how all creatures, and even the gods"
890,INTRODUCTION,"themselves, are subject to the will of Aphrodite, saving only Artemis,"
891,INTRODUCTION,"Athena, and Hestia; how Zeus to humble her pride of power caused her to"
892,INTRODUCTION,"love a mortal, Anchises; and how the goddess visited the hero upon Mt."
893,INTRODUCTION,"Ida. A comparison of this work with the Lay of Demodocus (""Odyssey"""
894,INTRODUCTION,"viii, 266 ff.), which is superficially similar, will show how far"
895,INTRODUCTION,superior is the former in which the goddess is but a victim to forces
896,INTRODUCTION,stronger than herself. The lines (247-255) in which Aphrodite tells of
897,INTRODUCTION,her humiliation and grief are specially noteworthy.
898,INTRODUCTION,
899,INTRODUCTION,There are only general indications of date. The influence of Hesiod is
900,INTRODUCTION,"clear, and the hymn has almost certainly been used by the author of the"
901,INTRODUCTION,"""Hymn to Demeter"", so that the date must lie between these two periods,"
902,INTRODUCTION,and the seventh century seems to be the latest date possible.
903,INTRODUCTION,
904,INTRODUCTION,"The ""Hymn to Dionysus"" relates how the god was seized by pirates and how"
905,INTRODUCTION,with many manifestations of power he avenged himself on them by turning
906,INTRODUCTION,"them into dolphins. The date is widely disputed, for while Ludwich"
907,INTRODUCTION,"believes it to be a work of the fourth or third century, Allen and Sikes"
908,INTRODUCTION,consider a sixth or seventh century date to be possible. The story is
909,INTRODUCTION,figured in a different form on the reliefs from the choragic monument of
910,INTRODUCTION,"Lysicrates, now in the British Museum [1117]."
911,INTRODUCTION,
912,INTRODUCTION,"Very different in character is the ""Hymn to Ares"", which is Orphic"
913,INTRODUCTION,"in character. The writer, after lauding the god by detailing his"
914,INTRODUCTION,"attributes, prays to be delivered from feebleness and weakness of soul,"
915,INTRODUCTION,as also from impulses to wanton and brutal violence.
916,INTRODUCTION,
917,INTRODUCTION,"The only other considerable hymn is that to ""Pan"", which describes how"
918,INTRODUCTION,"he roams hunting among the mountains and thickets and streams, how he"
919,INTRODUCTION,"makes music at dusk while returning from the chase, and how he joins in"
920,INTRODUCTION,"dancing with the nymphs who sing the story of his birth. This, beyond"
921,INTRODUCTION,"most works of Greek literature, is remarkable for its fresh and"
922,INTRODUCTION,spontaneous love of wild natural scenes.
923,INTRODUCTION,
924,INTRODUCTION,"The remaining hymns are mostly of the briefest compass, merely hailing"
925,INTRODUCTION,the god to be celebrated and mentioning his chief attributes. The Hymns
926,INTRODUCTION,"to ""Hermes"" (xviii), to the ""Dioscuri"" (xvii), and to ""Demeter"" (xiii)"
927,INTRODUCTION,"are mere abstracts of the longer hymns iv, xxxiii, and ii."

930,INTRODUCTION,
931,INTRODUCTION,
932,INTRODUCTION,The Epigrams of Homer
933,INTRODUCTION,
934,INTRODUCTION,"The ""Epigrams of Homer"" are derived from the pseudo-Herodotean ""Life of"
935,INTRODUCTION,"Homer"", but many of them occur in other documents such as the ""Contest"
936,INTRODUCTION,"of Homer and Hesiod"", or are quoted by various ancient authors. These"
937,INTRODUCTION,"poetic fragments clearly antedate the ""Life"" itself, which seems to have"
938,INTRODUCTION,been so written round them as to supply appropriate occasions for their
939,INTRODUCTION,composition. Epigram iii on Midas of Larissa was otherwise attributed to
940,INTRODUCTION,"Cleobulus of Lindus, one of the Seven Sages; the address to Glaucus (xi)"
941,INTRODUCTION,"is purely Hesiodic; xiii, according to MM. Croiset, is a fragment from a"
942,INTRODUCTION,gnomic poem. Epigram xiv is a curious poem attributed on no very obvious
943,INTRODUCTION,grounds to Hesiod by Julius Pollox. In it the poet invokes Athena to
944,INTRODUCTION,"protect certain potters and their craft, if they will, according to"
945,INTRODUCTION,"promise, give him a reward for his song; if they prove false, malignant"
946,INTRODUCTION,gnomes are invoked to wreck the kiln and hurt the potters.

948,INTRODUCTION,
949,INTRODUCTION,
950,INTRODUCTION,
951,INTRODUCTION,The Burlesque Poems
952,INTRODUCTION,
953,INTRODUCTION,To Homer were popularly ascribed certain burlesque poems in which
954,INTRODUCTION,"Aristotle (""Poetics"" iv) saw the germ of comedy. Most interesting of"
955,INTRODUCTION,"these, were it extant, would be the ""Margites"". The hero of the epic is"
956,INTRODUCTION,"at once sciolist and simpleton, 'knowing many things, but knowing them"
957,INTRODUCTION,all badly'. It is unfortunately impossible to trace the plan of
958,INTRODUCTION,"the poem, which presumably detailed the adventures of this unheroic"
959,INTRODUCTION,character: the metre used was a curious mixture of hexametric and iambic
960,INTRODUCTION,lines. The date of such a work cannot be high: Croiset thinks it may
961,INTRODUCTION,"belong to the period of Archilochus (c. 650 B.C.), but it may well be"
962,INTRODUCTION,somewhat later.
963,INTRODUCTION,
964,INTRODUCTION,"Another poem, of which we know even less, is the ""Cercopes"". These"
965,INTRODUCTION,Cercopes ('Monkey-Men') were a pair of malignant dwarfs who went about
966,INTRODUCTION,the world mischief-making. Their punishment by Heracles is represented
967,INTRODUCTION,on one of the earlier metopes from Selinus. It would be idle to
968,INTRODUCTION,speculate as to the date of this work.
969,INTRODUCTION,
970,INTRODUCTION,"Finally there is the ""Battle of the Frogs and Mice"". Here is told the"
971,INTRODUCTION,"story of the quarrel which arose between the two tribes, and how they"
972,INTRODUCTION,"fought, until Zeus sent crabs to break up the battle. It is a parody"
973,INTRODUCTION,"of the warlike epic, but has little in it that is really comic or of"
974,INTRODUCTION,"literary merit, except perhaps the list of quaint arms assumed by the"
975,INTRODUCTION,"warriors. The text of the poem is in a chaotic condition, and there are"
976,INTRODUCTION,"many interpolations, some of Byzantine date."
977,INTRODUCTION,
978,INTRODUCTION,"Though popularly ascribed to Homer, its real author is said by Suidas"
979,INTRODUCTION,"to have been Pigres, a Carian, brother of Artemisia, 'wife of Mausonis',"
980,INTRODUCTION,who distinguished herself at the battle of Salamis.
981,INTRODUCTION,
982,INTRODUCTION,"Suidas is confusing the two Artemisias, but he may be right in"
983,INTRODUCTION,attributing the poem to about 480 B.C.
984,INTRODUCTION,
985,INTRODUCTION,
986,INTRODUCTION,
987,INTRODUCTION,
988,INTRODUCTION,The Contest of Homer and Hesiod
989,INTRODUCTION,
990,INTRODUCTION,This curious work dates in its present form from the lifetime or shortly
991,INTRODUCTION,"after the death of Hadrian, but seems to be based in part on an earlier"
992,INTRODUCTION,"version by the sophist Alcidamas (c. 400 B.C.). Plutarch (""Conviv. Sept."
993,INTRODUCTION,"Sap."", 40) uses an earlier (or at least a shorter) version than that"
994,INTRODUCTION,"which we possess [1118]. The extant ""Contest"", however, has clearly"
995,INTRODUCTION,combined with the original document much other ill-digested matter on
996,INTRODUCTION,"the life and descent of Homer, probably drawing on the same general"
997,INTRODUCTION,"sources as does the Herodotean ""Life of Homer"". Its scope is as follows:"
998,INTRODUCTION,1) the descent (as variously reported) and relative dates of Homer and
999,INTRODUCTION,Hesiod; 2) their poetical contest at Chalcis; 3) the death of Hesiod;
1000,INTRODUCTION,"4) the wanderings and fortunes of Homer, with brief notices of the"
1001,INTRODUCTION,"circumstances under which his reputed works were composed, down to the"
1002,INTRODUCTION,time of his death.
1003,INTRODUCTION,
1004,INTRODUCTION,"The whole tract is, of course, mere romance; its only values are 1)"
1005,INTRODUCTION,the insight it give into ancient speculations about Homer; 2) a certain
1006,INTRODUCTION,amount of definite information about the Cyclic poems; and 3) the epic
1007,INTRODUCTION,"fragments included in the stichomythia of the ""Contest"" proper, many of"
1008,INTRODUCTION,which--did we possess the clue--would have to be referred to poems of

1304,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1305,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Attend thou with eye and ear, and make judgements straight with"

1307,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1308,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 11-24) So, after all, there was not one kind of Strife alone, but"
1309,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"all over the earth there are two. As for the one, a man would praise her"
1310,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,when he came to understand her; but the other is blameworthy: and they
1311,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"are wholly different in nature. For one fosters evil war and battle,"
1312,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"being cruel: her no man loves; but perforce, through the will of the"
1313,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"deathless gods, men pay harsh Strife her honour due. But the other is"
1314,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"the elder daughter of dark Night, and the son of Cronos who sits above"
1315,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and dwells in the aether, set her in the roots of the earth: and she is"
1316,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,far kinder to men. She stirs up even the shiftless to toil; for a man
1317,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"grows eager to work when he considers his neighbour, a rich man who"
1318,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,hastens to plough and plant and put his house in good order; and
1319,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,neighbour vies with his neighbour as he hurries after wealth. This
1320,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Strife is wholesome for men. And potter is angry with potter, and"
1321,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"craftsman with craftsman, and beggar is jealous of beggar, and minstrel"
1322,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,of minstrel.
1323,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1324,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 25-41) Perses, lay up these things in your heart, and do not let"
1325,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"that Strife who delights in mischief hold your heart back from work,"
1326,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,while you peep and peer and listen to the wrangles of the court-house.
1327,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Little concern has he with quarrels and courts who has not a year's
1328,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"victuals laid up betimes, even that which the earth bears, Demeter's"
1329,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"grain. When you have got plenty of that, you can raise disputes and"
1330,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,strive to get another's goods. But you shall have no second chance to
1331,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"deal so again: nay, let us settle our dispute here with true judgement"
1332,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"divided our inheritance, but you seized the greater share and carried it"
1333,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"off, greatly swelling the glory of our bribe-swallowing lords who love"
1334,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,to judge such a cause as this. Fools! They know not how much more the
1335,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"half is than the whole, nor what great advantage there is in mallow and"
1336,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,asphodel [1301].
1337,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1338,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 42-53) For the gods keep hidden from men the means of life. Else
1339,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,you would easily do work enough in a day to supply you for a full year
1340,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,even without working; soon would you put away your rudder over the
1341,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"smoke, and the fields worked by ox and sturdy mule would run to waste."
1342,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"But Zeus in the anger of his heart hid it, because Prometheus the crafty"
1343,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,deceived him; therefore he planned sorrow and mischief against men. He
1344,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,hid fire; but that the noble son of Iapetus stole again for men from
1345,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Zeus the counsellor in a hollow fennel-stalk, so that Zeus who delights"
1346,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,in thunder did not see it. But afterwards Zeus who gathers the clouds
1347,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,said to him in anger:
1348,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1349,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 54-59) 'Son of Iapetus, surpassing all in cunning, you are glad"
1350,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,that you have outwitted me and stolen fire--a great plague to you
1351,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,yourself and to men that shall be. But I will give men as the price for
1352,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,fire an evil thing in which they may all be glad of heart while they
1353,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,embrace their own destruction.'
1354,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1355,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 60-68) So said the father of men and gods, and laughed aloud. And"
1356,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,he bade famous Hephaestus make haste and mix earth with water and to put
1357,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"in it the voice and strength of human kind, and fashion a sweet, lovely"
1358,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"maiden-shape, like to the immortal goddesses in face; and Athene to"
1359,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,teach her needlework and the weaving of the varied web; and golden
1360,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Aphrodite to shed grace upon her head and cruel longing and cares that
1361,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"weary the limbs. And he charged Hermes the guide, the Slayer of Argus,"
1362,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,to put in her a shameless mind and a deceitful nature.
1363,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1364,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 69-82) So he ordered. And they obeyed the lord Zeus the son of
1365,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Cronos. Forthwith the famous Lame God moulded clay in the likeness of a
1366,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"modest maid, as the son of Cronos purposed. And the goddess bright-eyed"
1367,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Athene girded and clothed her, and the divine Graces and queenly"
1368,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Persuasion put necklaces of gold upon her, and the rich-haired Hours"
1369,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,crowned her head with spring flowers. And Pallas Athene bedecked her
1370,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"form with all manners of finery. Also the Guide, the Slayer of Argus,"
1371,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,contrived within her lies and crafty words and a deceitful nature at the
1372,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"will of loud thundering Zeus, and the Herald of the gods put speech in"
1373,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"her. And he called this woman Pandora [1302], because all they who dwelt"
1374,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"on Olympus gave each a gift, a plague to men who eat bread."
1375,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1376,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 83-89) But when he had finished the sheer, hopeless snare, the"
1377,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Father sent glorious Argos-Slayer, the swift messenger of the gods, to"
1378,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,take it to Epimetheus as a gift. And Epimetheus did not think on what
1379,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Prometheus had said to him, bidding him never take a gift of Olympian"
1380,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Zeus, but to send it back for fear it might prove to be something"
1381,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"harmful to men. But he took the gift, and afterwards, when the evil"
1382,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"thing was already his, he understood."
1383,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1384,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 90-105) For ere this the tribes of men lived on earth remote and
1385,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,free from ills and hard toil and heavy sickness which bring the Fates
1386,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,upon men; for in misery men grow old quickly. But the woman took off the
1387,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,great lid of the jar [1303] with her hands and scattered all these and
1388,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,her thought caused sorrow and mischief to men. Only Hope remained there
1389,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"in an unbreakable home within under the rim of the great jar, and did"
1390,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"not fly out at the door; for ere that, the lid of the jar stopped her,"
1391,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"by the will of Aegis-holding Zeus who gathers the clouds. But the rest,"
1392,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"countless plagues, wander amongst men; for earth is full of evils and"
1393,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,the sea is full. Of themselves diseases come upon men continually by day
1394,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and by night, bringing mischief to mortals silently; for wise Zeus took"
1395,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,away speech from them. So is there no way to escape the will of Zeus.
1396,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1397,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 106-108) Or if you will, I will sum you up another tale well and"
1398,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"skilfully--and do you lay it up in your heart,--how the gods and mortal"
1399,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,men sprang from one source.
1400,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1401,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 109-120) First of all the deathless gods who dwell on Olympus made
1402,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,a golden race of mortal men who lived in the time of Cronos when he was
1403,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"reigning in heaven. And they lived like gods without sorrow of heart,"
1404,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,remote and free from toil and grief: miserable age rested not on them;
1405,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,but with legs and arms never failing they made merry with feasting
1406,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"beyond the reach of all evils. When they died, it was as though they"
1407,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"were overcome with sleep, and they had all good things; for the fruitful"
1408,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,earth unforced bare them fruit abundantly and without stint. They dwelt
1409,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"in ease and peace upon their lands with many good things, rich in flocks"
1410,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and loved by the blessed gods.
1411,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1412,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 121-139) But after earth had covered this generation--they are
1413,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"called pure spirits dwelling on the earth, and are kindly, delivering"
1414,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"from harm, and guardians of mortal men; for they roam everywhere over"
1415,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"the earth, clothed in mist and keep watch on judgements and cruel deeds,"
1416,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,givers of wealth; for this royal right also they received;--then they
1417,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,who dwell on Olympus made a second generation which was of silver and
1418,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,less noble by far. It was like the golden race neither in body nor in
1419,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,spirit. A child was brought up at his good mother's side an hundred
1420,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"years, an utter simpleton, playing childishly in his own home. But when"
1421,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"they were full grown and were come to the full measure of their prime,"
1422,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"they lived only a little time in sorrow because of their foolishness,"
1423,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"for they could not keep from sinning and from wronging one another, nor"
1424,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"would they serve the immortals, nor sacrifice on the holy altars of the"
1425,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,blessed ones as it is right for men to do wherever they dwell. Then Zeus
1426,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"the son of Cronos was angry and put them away, because they would not"
1427,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,give honour to the blessed gods who live on Olympus.
1428,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1429,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 140-155) But when earth had covered this generation also--they are
1430,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"called blessed spirits of the underworld by men, and, though they are of"
1431,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"second order, yet honour attends them also--Zeus the Father made a third"
1432,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"generation of mortal men, a brazen race, sprung from ash-trees [1304];"
1433,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and it was in no way equal to the silver age, but was terrible and"
1434,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,strong. They loved the lamentable works of Ares and deeds of violence;
1435,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"they ate no bread, but were hard of heart like adamant, fearful men."
1436,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Great was their strength and unconquerable the arms which grew from
1437,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"their shoulders on their strong limbs. Their armour was of bronze, and"
1438,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"their houses of bronze, and of bronze were their implements: there was"
1439,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,no black iron. These were destroyed by their own hands and passed to the
1440,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"dank house of chill Hades, and left no name: terrible though they were,"
1441,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"black Death seized them, and they left the bright light of the sun."
1442,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1443,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 156-169b) But when earth had covered this generation also, Zeus"
1444,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"the son of Cronos made yet another, the fourth, upon the fruitful earth,"
1445,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"which was nobler and more righteous, a god-like race of hero-men who"
1446,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"are called demi-gods, the race before our own, throughout the boundless"
1447,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"earth. Grim war and dread battle destroyed a part of them, some in the"
1448,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,land of Cadmus at seven-gated Thebe when they fought for the flocks of
1449,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Oedipus, and some, when it had brought them in ships over the great sea"
1450,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,gulf to Troy for rich-haired Helen's sake: there death's end enshrouded
1451,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,a part of them. But to the others father Zeus the son of Cronos gave a
1452,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"living and an abode apart from men, and made them dwell at the ends of"
1453,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,earth. And they live untouched by sorrow in the islands of the blessed
1454,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"along the shore of deep swirling Ocean, happy heroes for whom the"
1455,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"grain-giving earth bears honey-sweet fruit flourishing thrice a year,"
1456,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"far from the deathless gods, and Cronos rules over them [1305]; for"
1457,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,the father of men and gods released him from his bonds. And these last
1458,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,equally have honour and glory.
1459,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1460,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 169c-169d) And again far-seeing Zeus made yet another generation,"
1461,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"the fifth, of men who are upon the bounteous earth."
1462,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1463,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 170-201) Thereafter, would that I were not among the men of the"
1464,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"fifth generation, but either had died before or been born afterwards."
1465,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"For now truly is a race of iron, and men never rest from labour and"
1466,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"sorrow by day, and from perishing by night; and the gods shall lay sore"
1467,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"trouble upon them. But, notwithstanding, even these shall have some good"
1468,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,mingled with their evils. And Zeus will destroy this race of mortal
1469,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,men also when they come to have grey hair on the temples at their birth
1470,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"[1306]. The father will not agree with his children, nor the children"
1471,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"with their father, nor guest with his host, nor comrade with comrade;"
1472,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,nor will brother be dear to brother as aforetime. Men will dishonour
1473,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"their parents as they grow quickly old, and will carp at them, chiding"
1474,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"them with bitter words, hard-hearted they, not knowing the fear of the"
1475,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"gods. They will not repay their aged parents the cost their nurture, for"
1476,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,might shall be their right: and one man will sack another's city. There
1477,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,will be no favour for the man who keeps his oath or for the just or
1478,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,for the good; but rather men will praise the evil-doer and his violent
1479,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,dealing. Strength will be right and reverence will cease to be; and the
1480,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"wicked will hurt the worthy man, speaking false words against him, and"
1481,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"will swear an oath upon them. Envy, foul-mouthed, delighting in evil,"
1482,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"with scowling face, will go along with wretched men one and all. And"
1483,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"then Aidos and Nemesis [1307], with their sweet forms wrapped in white"
1484,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"robes, will go from the wide-pathed earth and forsake mankind to join"
1485,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,the company of the deathless gods: and bitter sorrows will be left for
1486,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"mortal men, and there will be no help against evil."
1487,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1488,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 202-211) And now I will tell a fable for princes who themselves
1489,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"understand. Thus said the hawk to the nightingale with speckled neck,"
1490,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"while he carried her high up among the clouds, gripped fast in his"
1491,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"talons, and she, pierced by his crooked talons, cried pitifully. To her"
1492,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"he spoke disdainfully: 'Miserable thing, why do you cry out? One far"
1493,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"stronger than you now holds you fast, and you must go wherever I take"
1494,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"you, songstress as you are. And if I please I will make my meal of you,"
1495,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"or let you go. He is a fool who tries to withstand the stronger, for he"
1496,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,does not get the mastery and suffers pain besides his shame.' So said
1497,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"the swiftly flying hawk, the long-winged bird."
1498,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1499,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 212-224) But you, Perses, listen to right and do not foster"
1500,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,violence; for violence is bad for a poor man. Even the prosperous cannot
1501,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"easily bear its burden, but is weighed down under it when he has fallen"
1502,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,into delusion. The better path is to go by on the other side towards
1503,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,justice; for Justice beats Outrage when she comes at length to the end
1504,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,of the race. But only when he has suffered does the fool learn this. For
1505,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Oath keeps pace with wrong judgements. There is a noise when Justice is
1506,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,being dragged in the way where those who devour bribes and give sentence
1507,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"with crooked judgements, take her. And she, wrapped in mist, follows"
1508,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"to the city and haunts of the people, weeping, and bringing mischief"
1509,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"to men, even to such as have driven her forth in that they did not deal"
1510,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,straightly with her.
1511,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1512,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 225-237) But they who give straight judgements to strangers and
1513,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"to the men of the land, and go not aside from what is just, their city"
1514,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"flourishes, and the people prosper in it: Peace, the nurse of children,"
1515,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"is abroad in their land, and all-seeing Zeus never decrees cruel war"
1516,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,against them. Neither famine nor disaster ever haunt men who do true
1517,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,justice; but light-heartedly they tend the fields which are all their
1518,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"care. The earth bears them victual in plenty, and on the mountains the"
1519,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,oak bears acorns upon the top and bees in the midst. Their woolly sheep
1520,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,are laden with fleeces; their women bear children like their parents.
1521,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"They flourish continually with good things, and do not travel on ships,"
1522,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,for the grain-giving earth bears them fruit.
1523,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1524,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 238-247) But for those who practise violence and cruel deeds
1525,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"far-seeing Zeus, the son of Cronos, ordains a punishment. Often even"
1526,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,a whole city suffers for a bad man who sins and devises presumptuous
1527,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"deeds, and the son of Cronos lays great trouble upon the people, famine"
1528,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and plague together, so that the men perish away, and their women do not"
1529,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"bear children, and their houses become few, through the contriving of"
1530,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Olympian Zeus. And again, at another time, the son of Cronos either"
1531,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"destroys their wide army, or their walls, or else makes an end of their"
1532,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,ships on the sea.
1533,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1534,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 248-264) You princes, mark well this punishment you also; for the"
1535,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,deathless gods are near among men and mark all those who oppress their
1536,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"fellows with crooked judgements, and reck not the anger of the gods. For"
1537,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"upon the bounteous earth Zeus has thrice ten thousand spirits, watchers"
1538,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"of mortal men, and these keep watch on judgements and deeds of wrong"
1539,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"as they roam, clothed in mist, all over the earth. And there is virgin"
1540,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Justice, the daughter of Zeus, who is honoured and reverenced among"
1541,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"the gods who dwell on Olympus, and whenever anyone hurts her with lying"
1542,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"slander, she sits beside her father, Zeus the son of Cronos, and tells"
1543,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"him of men's wicked heart, until the people pay for the mad folly of"
1544,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"their princes who, evilly minded, pervert judgement and give sentence"
1545,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"crookedly. Keep watch against this, you princes, and make straight your"
1546,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"judgements, you who devour bribes; put crooked judgements altogether"
1547,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,from your thoughts.
1548,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1549,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 265-266) He does mischief to himself who does mischief to another,"
1550,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and evil planned harms the plotter most.
1551,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1552,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 267-273) The eye of Zeus, seeing all and understanding all, beholds"
1553,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"these things too, if so he will, and fails not to mark what sort of"
1554,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"justice is this that the city keeps within it. Now, therefore, may"
1555,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"neither I myself be righteous among men, nor my son--for then it is"
1556,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,a bad thing to be righteous--if indeed the unrighteous shall have the
1557,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,greater right. But I think that all-wise Zeus will not yet bring that to
1558,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,pass.
1559,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1560,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 274-285) But you, Perses, lay up these things within your heart and"
1561,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"listen now to right, ceasing altogether to think of violence. For the"
1562,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"son of Cronos has ordained this law for men, that fishes and beasts and"
1563,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"winged fowls should devour one another, for right is not in them; but to"
1564,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,mankind he gave right which proves far the best. For whoever knows the
1565,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"right and is ready to speak it, far-seeing Zeus gives him prosperity;"
1566,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"but whoever deliberately lies in his witness and forswears himself, and"
1567,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"so hurts Justice and sins beyond repair, that man's generation is left"
1568,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,obscure thereafter. But the generation of the man who swears truly is
1569,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,better thenceforward.
1570,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1571,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 286-292) To you, foolish Perses, I will speak good sense. Badness"
1572,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"can be got easily and in shoals: the road to her is smooth, and she"
1573,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,lives very near us. But between us and Goodness the gods have placed the
1574,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"sweat of our brows: long and steep is the path that leads to her, and it"
1575,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"is rough at the first; but when a man has reached the top, then is she"
1576,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"easy to reach, though before that she was hard."
1577,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1578,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 293-319) That man is altogether best who considers all things
1579,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"himself and marks what will be better afterwards and at the end; and he,"
1580,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"again, is good who listens to a good adviser; but whoever neither"
1581,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"thinks for himself nor keeps in mind what another tells him, he is an"
1582,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"unprofitable man. But do you at any rate, always remembering my charge,"
1583,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"work, high-born Perses, that Hunger may hate you, and venerable Demeter"
1584,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,richly crowned may love you and fill your barn with food; for Hunger is
1585,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,altogether a meet comrade for the sluggard. Both gods and men are angry
1586,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"with a man who lives idle, for in nature he is like the stingless drones"
1587,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"who waste the labour of the bees, eating without working; but let it"
1588,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"be your care to order your work properly, that in the right season your"
1589,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,barns may be full of victual. Through work men grow rich in flocks
1590,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and substance, and working they are much better loved by the immortals"
1591,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,[1308]. Work is no disgrace: it is idleness which is a disgrace. But
1592,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"if you work, the idle will soon envy you as you grow rich, for fame and"
1593,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"renown attend on wealth. And whatever be your lot, work is best for you,"
1594,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,if you turn your misguided mind away from other men's property to your
1595,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,work and attend to your livelihood as I bid you. An evil shame is the
1596,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"needy man's companion, shame which both greatly harms and prospers men:"
1597,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"shame is with poverty, but confidence with wealth."
1598,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1599,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 320-341) Wealth should not be seized: god-given wealth is much
1600,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"better; for if a man take great wealth violently and perforce, or if he"
1601,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"steal it through his tongue, as often happens when gain deceives men's"
1602,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"sense and dishonour tramples down honour, the gods soon blot him out"
1603,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and make that man's house low, and wealth attends him only for a little"
1604,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"time. Alike with him who does wrong to a suppliant or a guest, or who"
1605,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,goes up to his brother's bed and commits unnatural sin in lying with
1606,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"his wife, or who infatuately offends against fatherless children, or who"
1607,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,abuses his old father at the cheerless threshold of old age and attacks
1608,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"him with harsh words, truly Zeus himself is angry, and at the last"
1609,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,lays on him a heavy requittal for his evil doing. But do you turn your
1610,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"foolish heart altogether away from these things, and, as far as you are"
1611,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"able, sacrifice to the deathless gods purely and cleanly, and burn"
1612,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"rich meats also, and at other times propitiate them with libations and"
1613,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"incense, both when you go to bed and when the holy light has come back,"
1614,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"that they may be gracious to you in heart and spirit, and so you may buy"
1615,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,another's holding and not another yours.
1616,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1617,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 342-351) Call your friend to a feast; but leave your enemy alone;
1618,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and especially call him who lives near you: for if any mischief
1619,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"happen in the place, neighbours come ungirt, but kinsmen stay to gird"
1620,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,themselves [1309]. A bad neighbour is as great a plague as a good one
1621,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,is a great blessing; he who enjoys a good neighbour has a precious
1622,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,possession. Not even an ox would die but for a bad neighbour. Take
1623,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,fair measure from your neighbour and pay him back fairly with the same
1624,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"measure, or better, if you can; so that if you are in need afterwards,"
1625,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,you may find him sure.
1626,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1627,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 352-369) Do not get base gain: base gain is as bad as ruin. Be
1628,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"friends with the friendly, and visit him who visits you. Give to one"
1629,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"who gives, but do not give to one who does not give. A man gives to the"
1630,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"free-handed, but no one gives to the close-fisted. Give is a good girl,"
1631,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"but Take is bad and she brings death. For the man who gives willingly,"
1632,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"even though he gives a great thing, rejoices in his gift and is glad"
1633,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,in heart; but whoever gives way to shamelessness and takes something
1634,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"himself, even though it be a small thing, it freezes his heart. He who"
1635,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"adds to what he has, will keep off bright-eyed hunger; for if you add"
1636,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"only a little to a little and do this often, soon that little will"
1637,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,become great. What a man has by him at home does not trouble him: it is
1638,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"better to have your stuff at home, for whatever is abroad may mean loss."
1639,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,It is a good thing to draw on what you have; but it grieves your heart
1640,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"to need something and not to have it, and I bid you mark this. Take"
1641,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"your fill when the cask is first opened and when it is nearly spent, but"
1642,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,midways be sparing: it is poor saving when you come to the lees.
1643,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1644,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 370-372) Let the wage promised to a friend be fixed; even with your
1645,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"brother smile--and get a witness; for trust and mistrust, alike ruin"
1646,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,men.
1647,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1648,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 373-375) Do not let a flaunting woman coax and cozen and deceive
1649,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,you: she is after your barn. The man who trusts womankind trusts
1650,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,deceivers.
1651,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1652,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 376-380) There should be an only son, to feed his father's house,"
1653,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,for so wealth will increase in the home; but if you leave a second son
1654,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,you should die old. Yet Zeus can easily give great wealth to a greater
1655,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,number. More hands mean more work and more increase.
1656,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1657,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 381-382) If your heart within you desires wealth, do these things"
1658,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and work with work upon work.
1659,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1660,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 383-404) When the Pleiades, daughters of Atlas, are rising [1310],"
1661,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"begin your harvest, and your ploughing when they are going to set"
1662,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,[1311]. Forty nights and days they are hidden and appear again as the
1663,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"year moves round, when first you sharpen your sickle. This is the law"
1664,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"of the plains, and of those who live near the sea, and who inhabit rich"
1665,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"country, the glens and dingles far from the tossing sea,--strip to"
1666,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"sow and strip to plough and strip to reap, if you wish to get in all"
1667,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Demeter's fruits in due season, and that each kind may grow in its"
1668,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"season. Else, afterwards, you may chance to be in want, and go begging"
1669,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"to other men's houses, but without avail; as you have already come to"
1670,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,me. But I will give you no more nor give you further measure. Foolish
1671,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Perses! Work the work which the gods ordained for men, lest in bitter"
1672,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,anguish of spirit you with your wife and children seek your livelihood
1673,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"amongst your neighbours, and they do not heed you. Two or three times,"
1674,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"may be, you will succeed, but if you trouble them further, it will"
1675,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"not avail you, and all your talk will be in vain, and your word-play"
1676,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"unprofitable. Nay, I bid you find a way to pay your debts and avoid"
1677,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,hunger.
1678,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1679,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 405-413) First of all, get a house, and a woman and an ox for the"
1680,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"plough--a slave woman and not a wife, to follow the oxen as well--and"
1681,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"make everything ready at home, so that you may not have to ask of"
1682,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"another, and he refuses you, and so, because you are in lack, the season"
1683,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,pass by and your work come to nothing. Do not put your work off till
1684,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,to-morrow and the day after; for a sluggish worker does not fill his
1685,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"barn, nor one who puts off his work: industry makes work go well, but a"
1686,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,man who puts off work is always at hand-grips with ruin.
1687,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1688,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 414-447) When the piercing power and sultry heat of the sun abate,"
1689,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and almighty Zeus sends the autumn rains [1312], and men's flesh comes"
1690,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"to feel far easier,--for then the star Sirius passes over the heads"
1691,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"of men, who are born to misery, only a little while by day and takes"
1692,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"greater share of night,--then, when it showers its leaves to the ground"
1693,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and stops sprouting, the wood you cut with your axe is least liable to"
1694,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,worm. Then remember to hew your timber: it is the season for that work.
1695,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Cut a mortar [1313] three feet wide and a pestle three cubits long, and"
1696,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"an axle of seven feet, for it will do very well so; but if you make"
1697,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"it eight feet long, you can cut a beetle [1314] from it as well. Cut"
1698,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,a felloe three spans across for a waggon of ten palms' width. Hew also
1699,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"many bent timbers, and bring home a plough-tree when you have found it,"
1700,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and look out on the mountain or in the field for one of holm-oak; for
1701,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,this is the strongest for oxen to plough with when one of Athena's
1702,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,handmen has fixed in the share-beam and fastened it to the pole with
1703,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"dowels. Get two ploughs ready work on them at home, one all of a piece,"
1704,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and the other jointed. It is far better to do this, for if you should"
1705,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"break one of them, you can put the oxen to the other. Poles of laurel or"
1706,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"elm are most free from worms, and a share-beam of oak and a plough-tree"
1707,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"of holm-oak. Get two oxen, bulls of nine years; for their strength is"
1708,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,unspent and they are in the prime of their age: they are best for work.
1709,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,They will not fight in the furrow and break the plough and then leave
1710,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"the work undone. Let a brisk fellow of forty years follow them, with a"
1711,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"loaf of four quarters [1315] and eight slices [1316] for his dinner, one"
1712,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,who will attend to his work and drive a straight furrow and is past the
1713,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"age for gaping after his fellows, but will keep his mind on his work. No"
1714,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,younger man will be better than he at scattering the seed and avoiding
1715,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"double-sowing; for a man less staid gets disturbed, hankering after his"
1716,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,fellows.
1717,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1718,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 448-457) Mark, when you hear the voice of the crane [1317] who"
1719,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"cries year by year from the clouds above, for she give the signal for"
1720,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,ploughing and shows the season of rainy winter; but she vexes the heart
1721,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,of the man who has no oxen. Then is the time to feed up your horned
1722,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,oxen in the byre; for it is easy to say: 'Give me a yoke of oxen and a
1723,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"waggon,' and it is easy to refuse: 'I have work for my oxen.' The man"
1724,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,who is rich in fancy thinks his waggon as good as built already--the
1725,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,fool! He does not know that there are a hundred timbers to a waggon.
1726,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Take care to lay these up beforehand at home.
1727,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1728,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 458-464) So soon as the time for ploughing is proclaimed to men,"
1729,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"then make haste, you and your slaves alike, in wet and in dry, to plough"
1730,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"in the season for ploughing, and bestir yourself early in the morning so"
1731,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,that your fields may be full. Plough in the spring; but fallow broken up
1732,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,in the summer will not belie your hopes. Sow fallow land when the
1733,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,soil is still getting light: fallow land is a defender from harm and a
1734,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,soother of children.
1735,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1736,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 465-478) Pray to Zeus of the Earth and to pure Demeter to make
1737,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Demeter's holy grain sound and heavy, when first you begin ploughing,"
1738,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,when you hold in your hand the end of the plough-tail and bring down
1739,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,your stick on the backs of the oxen as they draw on the pole-bar by the
1740,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,yoke-straps. Let a slave follow a little behind with a mattock and make
1741,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,trouble for the birds by hiding the seed; for good management is the
1742,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,best for mortal men as bad management is the worst. In this way your
1743,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,corn-ears will bow to the ground with fullness if the Olympian himself
1744,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"gives a good result at the last, and you will sweep the cobwebs from"
1745,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"your bins and you will be glad, I ween, as you take of your garnered"
1746,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,substance. And so you will have plenty till you come to grey [1318]
1747,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"springtime, and will not look wistfully to others, but another shall be"
1748,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,in need of your help.
1749,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1750,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 479-492) But if you plough the good ground at the solstice [1319],"
1751,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"you will reap sitting, grasping a thin crop in your hand, binding the"
1752,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"sheaves awry, dust-covered, not glad at all; so you will bring all home"
1753,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,in a basket and not many will admire you. Yet the will of Zeus who holds
1754,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,the aegis is different at different times; and it is hard for mortal
1755,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"men to tell it; for if you should plough late, you may find this"
1756,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,remedy--when the cuckoo first calls [1320] in the leaves of the oak and
1757,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"makes men glad all over the boundless earth, if Zeus should send rain"
1758,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,on the third day and not cease until it rises neither above an ox's hoof
1759,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"nor falls short of it, then the late-plougher will vie with the early."
1760,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Keep all this well in mind, and fail not to mark grey spring as it comes"
1761,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and the season of rain.
1762,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1763,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll 493-501) Pass by the smithy and its crowded lounge in winter time
1764,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"when the cold keeps men from field work,--for then an industrious man"
1765,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,can greatly prosper his house--lest bitter winter catch you helpless and
1766,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,poor and you chafe a swollen foot with a shrunk hand. The idle man
1767,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"who waits on empty hope, lacking a livelihood, lays to heart"
1768,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,mischief-making; it is not an wholesome hope that accompanies a need man
1769,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,who lolls at ease while he has no sure livelihood.
1770,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1771,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 502-503) While it is yet midsummer command your slaves: 'It will
1772,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"not always be summer, build barns.'"
1773,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1774,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 504-535) Avoid the month Lenaeon [1321], wretched days, all of them"
1775,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"fit to skin an ox, and the frosts which are cruel when Boreas blows over"
1776,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,the earth. He blows across horse-breeding Thrace upon the wide sea and
1777,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"stirs it up, while earth and the forest howl. On many a high-leafed"
1778,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,oak and thick pine he falls and brings them to the bounteous earth in
1779,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,mountain glens: then all the immense wood roars and the beasts shudder
1780,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and put their tails between their legs, even those whose hide is covered"
1781,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,with fur; for with his bitter blast he blows even through them although
1782,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,they are shaggy-breasted. He goes even through an ox's hide; it does not
1783,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,stop him. Also he blows through the goat's fine hair. But through the
1784,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"fleeces of sheep, because their wool is abundant, the keen wind Boreas"
1785,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,pierces not at all; but it makes the old man curved as a wheel. And it
1786,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,does not blow through the tender maiden who stays indoors with her
1787,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"dear mother, unlearned as yet in the works of golden Aphrodite, and who"
1788,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,washes her soft body and anoints herself with oil and lies down in an
1789,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"inner room within the house, on a winter's day when the Boneless One"
1790,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,[1322] gnaws his foot in his fireless house and wretched home; for the
1791,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"sun shows him no pastures to make for, but goes to and fro over the land"
1792,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and city of dusky men [1323], and shines more sluggishly upon the whole"
1793,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"race of the Hellenes. Then the horned and unhorned denizens of the wood,"
1794,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"with teeth chattering pitifully, flee through the copses and glades, and"
1795,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"all, as they seek shelter, have this one care, to gain thick coverts or"
1796,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"some hollow rock. Then, like the Three-legged One [1324] whose back is"
1797,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"broken and whose head looks down upon the ground, like him, I say, they"
1798,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,wander to escape the white snow.
1799,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1800,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 536-563) Then put on, as I bid you, a soft coat and a tunic to the"
1801,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"feet to shield your body,--and you should weave thick woof on thin warp."
1802,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,In this clothe yourself so that your hair may keep still and not bristle
1803,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and stand upon end all over your body.
1804,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1805,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Lace on your feet close-fitting boots of the hide of a slaughtered ox,"
1806,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"thickly lined with felt inside. And when the season of frost comes on,"
1807,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"stitch together skins of firstling kids with ox-sinew, to put over your"
1808,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,back and to keep off the rain. On your head above wear a shaped cap
1809,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"of felt to keep your ears from getting wet, for the dawn is chill when"
1810,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Boreas has once made his onslaught, and at dawn a fruitful mist is"
1811,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,spread over the earth from starry heaven upon the fields of blessed men:
1812,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,it is drawn from the ever flowing rivers and is raised high above the
1813,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"earth by windstorm, and sometimes it turns to rain towards evening, and"
1814,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,sometimes to wind when Thracian Boreas huddles the thick clouds. Finish
1815,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"your work and return home ahead of him, and do not let the dark cloud"
1816,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,from heaven wrap round you and make your body clammy and soak your
1817,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"clothes. Avoid it; for this is the hardest month, wintry, hard for sheep"
1818,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and hard for men. In this season let your oxen have half their usual
1819,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"food, but let your man have more; for the helpful nights are long."
1820,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Observe all this until the year is ended and you have nights and days
1821,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"of equal length, and Earth, the mother of all, bears again her various"
1822,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,fruit.
1823,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1824,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 564-570) When Zeus has finished sixty wintry days after the
1825,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"solstice, then the star Arcturus [1325] leaves the holy stream of"
1826,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Ocean and first rises brilliant at dusk. After him the shrilly wailing
1827,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"daughter of Pandion, the swallow, appears to men when spring is just"
1828,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"beginning. Before she comes, prune the vines, for it is best so."
1829,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1830,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 571-581) But when the House-carrier [1326] climbs up the plants
1831,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"from the earth to escape the Pleiades, then it is no longer the season"
1832,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"for digging vineyards, but to whet your sickles and rouse up your"
1833,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"slaves. Avoid shady seats and sleeping until dawn in the harvest season,"
1834,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"when the sun scorches the body. Then be busy, and bring home your"
1835,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"fruits, getting up early to make your livelihood sure. For dawn takes"
1836,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"away a third part of your work, dawn advances a man on his journey and"
1837,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"advances him in his work,--dawn which appears and sets many men on their"
1838,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"road, and puts yokes on many oxen."
1839,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1840,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 582-596) But when the artichoke flowers [1327], and the chirping"
1841,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,grass-hopper sits in a tree and pours down his shrill song continually
1842,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"from under his wings in the season of wearisome heat, then goats are"
1843,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"plumpest and wine sweetest; women are most wanton, but men are feeblest,"
1844,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,because Sirius parches head and knees and the skin is dry through heat.
1845,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"But at that time let me have a shady rock and wine of Biblis, a clot of"
1846,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,curds and milk of drained goats with the flesh of an heifer fed in the
1847,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"woods, that has never calved, and of firstling kids; then also let me"
1848,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"drink bright wine, sitting in the shade, when my heart is satisfied"
1849,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"with food, and so, turning my head to face the fresh Zephyr, from the"
1850,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,everflowing spring which pours down unfouled thrice pour an offering of
1851,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"water, but make a fourth libation of wine."
1852,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1853,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 597-608) Set your slaves to winnow Demeter's holy grain, when"
1854,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"strong Orion [1328] first appears, on a smooth threshing-floor in an"
1855,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,airy place. Then measure it and store it in jars. And so soon as you
1856,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"have safely stored all your stuff indoors, I bid you put your bondman"
1857,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,out of doors and look out for a servant-girl with no children;--for a
1858,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,servant with a child to nurse is troublesome. And look after the
1859,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"dog with jagged teeth; do not grudge him his food, or some time the"
1860,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Day-sleeper [1329] may take your stuff. Bring in fodder and litter so
1861,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"as to have enough for your oxen and mules. After that, let your men rest"
1862,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,their poor knees and unyoke your pair of oxen.
1863,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1864,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 609-617) But when Orion and Sirius are come into mid-heaven,"
1865,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and rosy-fingered Dawn sees Arcturus [1330], then cut off all the"
1866,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"grape-clusters, Perses, and bring them home. Show them to the sun ten"
1867,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"days and ten nights: then cover them over for five, and on the sixth"
1868,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,day draw off into vessels the gifts of joyful Dionysus. But when the
1869,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Pleiades and Hyades and strong Orion begin to set [1331], then remember"
1870,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,to plough in season: and so the completed year [1332] will fitly pass
1871,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,beneath the earth.
1872,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1873,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 618-640) But if desire for uncomfortable sea-faring seize you; when
1874,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,the Pleiades plunge into the misty sea [1333] to escape Orion's rude
1875,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"strength, then truly gales of all kinds rage. Then keep ships no longer"
1876,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"on the sparkling sea, but bethink you to till the land as I bid you."
1877,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Haul up your ship upon the land and pack it closely with stones all
1878,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"round to keep off the power of the winds which blow damply, and draw out"
1879,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,the bilge-plug so that the rain of heaven may not rot it. Put away
1880,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"all the tackle and fittings in your house, and stow the wings of the"
1881,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"sea-going ship neatly, and hang up the well-shaped rudder over the"
1882,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"smoke. You yourself wait until the season for sailing is come, and then"
1883,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"haul your swift ship down to the sea and stow a convenient cargo in it,"
1884,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"so that you may bring home profit, even as your father and mine,"
1885,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"foolish Perses, used to sail on shipboard because he lacked sufficient"
1886,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,livelihood. And one day he came to this very place crossing over a
1887,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"great stretch of sea; he left Aeolian Cyme and fled, not from riches and"
1888,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"substance, but from wretched poverty which Zeus lays upon men, and"
1889,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"he settled near Helicon in a miserable hamlet, Ascra, which is bad in"
1890,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"winter, sultry in summer, and good at no time."
1891,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1892,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 641-645) But you, Perses, remember all works in their season but"
1893,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"sailing especially. Admire a small ship, but put your freight in a large"
1894,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"one; for the greater the lading, the greater will be your piled gain, if"
1895,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,only the winds will keep back their harmful gales.
1896,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1897,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 646-662) If ever you turn your misguided heart to trading and with
1898,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"to escape from debt and joyless hunger, I will show you the measures of"
1899,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"the loud-roaring sea, though I have no skill in sea-faring nor in ships;"
1900,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"for never yet have I sailed by ship over the wide sea, but only to"
1901,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Euboea from Aulis where the Achaeans once stayed through much storm when
1902,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"they had gathered a great host from divine Hellas for Troy, the land"
1903,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"of fair women. Then I crossed over to Chalcis, to the games of wise"
1904,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Amphidamas where the sons of the great-hearted hero proclaimed and
1905,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,appointed prizes. And there I boast that I gained the victory with a
1906,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,song and carried off an handled tripod which I dedicated to the Muses of
1907,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Helicon, in the place where they first set me in the way of clear song."
1908,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Such is all my experience of many-pegged ships; nevertheless I will tell
1909,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,you the will of Zeus who holds the aegis; for the Muses have taught me
1910,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,to sing in marvellous song.
1911,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1912,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 663-677) Fifty days after the solstice [1334], when the season"
1913,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"of wearisome heat is come to an end, is the right time for me to go"
1914,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"sailing. Then you will not wreck your ship, nor will the sea destroy the"
1915,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"sailors, unless Poseidon the Earth-Shaker be set upon it, or Zeus, the"
1916,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"king of the deathless gods, wish to slay them; for the issues of good"
1917,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and evil alike are with them. At that time the winds are steady, and"
1918,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"the sea is harmless. Then trust in the winds without care, and haul your"
1919,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,swift ship down to the sea and put all the freight on board; but make
1920,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,all haste you can to return home again and do not wait till the time of
1921,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,the new wine and autumn rain and oncoming storms with the fierce gales
1922,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,of Notus who accompanies the heavy autumn rain of Zeus and stirs up the
1923,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,sea and makes the deep dangerous.
1924,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1925,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 678-694) Another time for men to go sailing is in spring when a
1926,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,man first sees leaves on the topmost shoot of a fig-tree as large as the
1927,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"foot-print that a cow makes; then the sea is passable, and this is the"
1928,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"spring sailing time. For my part I do not praise it, for my heart does"
1929,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"not like it. Such a sailing is snatched, and you will hardly avoid"
1930,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"mischief. Yet in their ignorance men do even this, for wealth means life"
1931,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,to poor mortals; but it is fearful to die among the waves. But I bid you
1932,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,consider all these things in your heart as I say. Do not put all your
1933,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"goods in hallow ships; leave the greater part behind, and put the lesser"
1934,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,part on board; for it is a bad business to meet with disaster among
1935,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"the waves of the sea, as it is bad if you put too great a load on your"
1936,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"waggon and break the axle, and your goods are spoiled. Observe due"
1937,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,measure: and proportion is best in all things.
1938,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1939,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 695-705) Bring home a wife to your house when you are of the right
1940,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"age, while you are not far short of thirty years nor much above; this is"
1941,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"the right age for marriage. Let your wife have been grown up four years,"
1942,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and marry her in the fifth. Marry a maiden, so that you can teach her"
1943,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"careful ways, and especially marry one who lives near you, but look"
1944,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,well about you and see that your marriage will not be a joke to your
1945,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"neighbours. For a man wins nothing better than a good wife, and, again,"
1946,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"nothing worse than a bad one, a greedy soul who roasts her man without"
1947,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"fire, strong though he may be, and brings him to a raw [1335] old age."
1948,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1949,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 706-714) Be careful to avoid the anger of the deathless gods. Do
1950,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"not make a friend equal to a brother; but if you do, do not wrong him"
1951,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"first, and do not lie to please the tongue. But if he wrongs you first,"
1952,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"offending either in word or in deed, remember to repay him double;"
1953,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,but if he ask you to be his friend again and be ready to give you
1954,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"satisfaction, welcome him. He is a worthless man who makes now one and"
1955,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"now another his friend; but as for you, do not let your face put your"
1956,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,heart to shame [1336].
1957,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1958,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 715-716) Do not get a name either as lavish or as churlish; as a
1959,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,friend of rogues or as a slanderer of good men.
1960,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1961,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 717-721) Never dare to taunt a man with deadly poverty which eats
1962,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,out the heart; it is sent by the deathless gods. The best treasure a man
1963,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"can have is a sparing tongue, and the greatest pleasure, one that moves"
1964,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"orderly; for if you speak evil, you yourself will soon be worse spoken"
1965,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,of.
1966,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1967,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 722-723) Do not be boorish at a common feast where there are many
1968,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,guests; the pleasure is greatest and the expense is least [1337].
1969,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1970,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 724-726) Never pour a libation of sparkling wine to Zeus after dawn
1971,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"with unwashen hands, nor to others of the deathless gods; else they do"
1972,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,not hear your prayers but spit them back.
1973,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1974,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 727-732) Do not stand upright facing the sun when you make water,"
1975,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,but remember to do this when he has set towards his rising. And do not
1976,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"make water as you go, whether on the road or off the road, and do not"
1977,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,uncover yourself: the nights belong to the blessed gods. A scrupulous
1978,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,man who has a wise heart sits down or goes to the wall of an enclosed
1979,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,court.
1980,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1981,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 733-736) Do not expose yourself befouled by the fireside in your
1982,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"house, but avoid this. Do not beget children when you are come back from"
1983,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"ill-omened burial, but after a festival of the gods."
1984,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1985,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 737-741) Never cross the sweet-flowing water of ever-rolling rivers
1986,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"afoot until you have prayed, gazing into the soft flood, and washed your"
1987,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"hands in the clear, lovely water. Whoever crosses a river with hands"
1988,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"unwashed of wickedness, the gods are angry with him and bring trouble"
1989,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,upon him afterwards.
1990,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1991,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 742-743) At a cheerful festival of the gods do not cut the withered
1992,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,from the quick upon that which has five branches [1338] with bright
1993,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,steel.
1994,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1995,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 744-745) Never put the ladle upon the mixing-bowl at a wine party,"
1996,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,for malignant ill-luck is attached to that.
1997,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
1998,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 746-747) When you are building a house, do not leave it rough-hewn,"
1999,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,or a cawing crow may settle on it and croak.
2000,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2001,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 748-749) Take nothing to eat or to wash with from uncharmed pots,"
2002,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,for in them there is mischief.
2003,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2004,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 750-759) Do not let a boy of twelve years sit on things which may
2005,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"not be moved [1339], for that is bad, and makes a man unmanly; nor yet"
2006,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"a child of twelve months, for that has the same effect. A man should"
2007,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"not clean his body with water in which a woman has washed, for there is"
2008,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,bitter mischief in that also for a time. When you come upon a burning
2009,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"sacrifice, do not make a mock of mysteries, for Heaven is angry at this"
2010,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"also. Never make water in the mouths of rivers which flow to the sea,"
2011,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,nor yet in springs; but be careful to avoid this. And do not ease
2012,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,yourself in them: it is not well to do this.
2013,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2014,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 760-763) So do: and avoid the talk of men. For Talk is mischievous,"
2015,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"light, and easily raised, but hard to bear and difficult to be rid of."
2016,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Talk never wholly dies away when many people voice her: even Talk is in
2017,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,some ways divine.
2018,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2019,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 765-767) Mark the days which come from Zeus, duly telling your"
2020,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"slaves of them, and that the thirtieth day of the month is best for one"
2021,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,to look over the work and to deal out supplies.
2022,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2023,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 769-768) [1340] For these are days which come from Zeus the
2024,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"all-wise, when men discern aright."
2025,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2026,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 770-779) To begin with, the first, the fourth, and the seventh--on"
2027,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,which Leto bare Apollo with the blade of gold--each is a holy day. The
2028,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"eighth and the ninth, two days at least of the waxing month [1341], are"
2029,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,specially good for the works of man. Also the eleventh and twelfth are
2030,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"both excellent, alike for shearing sheep and for reaping the kindly"
2031,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"fruits; but the twelfth is much better than the eleventh, for on it the"
2032,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"airy-swinging spider spins its web in full day, and then the Wise One"
2033,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"[1342], gathers her pile. On that day woman should set up her loom and"
2034,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,get forward with her work.
2035,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2036,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 780-781) Avoid the thirteenth of the waxing month for beginning to
2037,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,sow: yet it is the best day for setting plants.
2038,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2039,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 782-789) The sixth of the mid-month is very unfavourable for
2040,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"plants, but is good for the birth of males, though unfavourable for a"
2041,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,girl either to be born at all or to be married. Nor is the first sixth
2042,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"a fit day for a girl to be born, but a kindly for gelding kids and sheep"
2043,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and for fencing in a sheep-cote. It is favourable for the birth of a
2044,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"boy, but such will be fond of sharp speech, lies, and cunning words, and"
2045,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,stealthy converse.
2046,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2047,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 790-791) On the eighth of the month geld the boar and
2048,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"loud-bellowing bull, but hard-working mules on the twelfth."
2049,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2050,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 792-799) On the great twentieth, in full day, a wise man should be"
2051,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,born. Such an one is very sound-witted. The tenth is favourable for a
2052,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"male to be born; but, for a girl, the fourth day of the mid-month. On"
2053,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"that day tame sheep and shambling, horned oxen, and the sharp-fanged"
2054,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,dog and hardy mules to the touch of the hand. But take care to avoid
2055,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,troubles which eat out the heart on the fourth of the beginning and
2056,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,ending of the month; it is a day very fraught with fate.
2057,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2058,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 800-801) On the fourth of the month bring home your bride, but"
2059,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,choose the omens which are best for this business.
2060,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2061,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 802-804) Avoid fifth days: they are unkindly and terrible. On a
2062,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"fifth day, they say, the Erinyes assisted at the birth of Horcus (Oath)"
2063,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,whom Eris (Strife) bare to trouble the forsworn. {[0-9]} (ll. 805-809)
2064,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Look about you very carefully and throw out Demeter's holy grain upon
2065,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,the well-rolled [1343] threshing floor on the seventh of the mid-month.
2066,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Let the woodman cut beams for house building and plenty of ships'
2067,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"timbers, such as are suitable for ships. On the fourth day begin to"
2068,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,build narrow ships.
2069,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2070,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 810-813) The ninth of the mid-month improves towards evening; but
2071,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,the first ninth of all is quite harmless for men. It is a good day on
2072,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,which to beget or to be born both for a male and a female: it is never
2073,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,an wholly evil day.
2074,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2075,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 814-818) Again, few know that the twenty-seventh of the month is"
2076,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"best for opening a wine-jar, and putting yokes on the necks of oxen"
2077,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and mules and swift-footed horses, and for hauling a swift ship of many"
2078,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,thwarts down to the sparkling sea; few call it by its right name.
2079,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2080,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 819-821) On the fourth day open a jar. The fourth of the mid-month
2081,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"is a day holy above all. And again, few men know that the fourth day"
2082,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,after the twentieth is best while it is morning: towards evening it is
2083,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,less good.
2084,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2085,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 822-828) These days are a great blessing to men on earth; but the
2086,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"rest are changeable, luckless, and bring nothing. Everyone praises"
2087,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,a different day but few know their nature. Sometimes a day is a
2088,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"stepmother, sometimes a mother. That man is happy and lucky in them who"
2089,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,knows all these things and does his work without offending the deathless
2090,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"gods, who discerns the omens of birds and avoids transgressions."

2125,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Fragment #3--Pseudo-Eratosthenes Catast. frag. 1: [1402] The Great
2126,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Bear.]--Hesiod says she (Callisto) was the daughter of Lycaon and
2127,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,lived in Arcadia. She chose to occupy herself with wild-beasts in the
2128,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"mountains together with Artemis, and, when she was seduced by Zeus,"
2129,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"continued some time undetected by the goddess, but afterwards, when she"
2130,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"was already with child, was seen by her bathing and so discovered. Upon"
2131,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"this, the goddess was enraged and changed her into a beast. Thus she"
2132,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,became a bear and gave birth to a son called Arcas. But while she was in
2133,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"the mountains, she was hunted by some goat-herds and given up with"
2134,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"her babe to Lycaon. Some while after, she thought fit to go into the"
2135,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"forbidden precinct of Zeus, not knowing the law, and being pursued by"
2136,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"her own son and the Arcadians, was about to be killed because of the"
2137,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,said law; but Zeus delivered her because of her connection with him
2138,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and put her among the stars, giving her the name Bear because of the"
2139,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,misfortune which had befallen her.
2140,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2141,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Comm. Supplem. on Aratus, p. 547 M. 8: Of Bootes, also called the"
2142,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Bear-warden. The story goes that he is Arcas the son of Callisto and
2143,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Zeus, and he lived in the country about Lycaeum. After Zeus had seduced"
2144,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Callisto, Lycaon, pretending not to know of the matter, entertained"
2145,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Zeus, as Hesiod says, and set before him on the table the babe which he"
2146,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,had cut up.
2147,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,

2149,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Fragment #4--Pseudo-Eratosthenes, Catast. fr. xxxii: Orion.]--Hesiod"
2150,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"says that he was the son of Euryale, the daughter of Minos, and of"
2151,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Poseidon, and that there was given him as a gift the power of walking"
2152,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"upon the waves as though upon land. When he was come to Chios, he"
2153,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"outraged Merope, the daughter of Oenopion, being drunken; but Oenopion"
2154,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,when he learned of it was greatly vexed at the outrage and blinded him
2155,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and cast him out of the country. Then he came to Lemnos as a beggar and
2156,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,there met Hephaestus who took pity on him and gave him Cedalion his own
2157,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,servant to guide him. So Orion took Cedalion upon his shoulders and used
2158,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,to carry him about while he pointed out the roads. Then he came to the
2159,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"east and appears to have met Helius (the Sun) and to have been healed,"
2160,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and so returned back again to Oenopion to punish him; but Oenopion was
2161,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"hidden away by his people underground. Being disappointed, then, in his"
2162,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"search for the king, Orion went away to Crete and spent his time hunting"
2163,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,in company with Artemis and Leto. It seems that he threatened to kill
2164,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"every beast there was on earth; whereupon, in her anger, Earth sent up"
2165,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,against him a scorpion of very great size by which he was stung and so
2166,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"perished. After this Zeus, at one prayer of Artemis and Leto, put him"
2167,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"among the stars, because of his manliness, and the scorpion also as a"

2263,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"mere bellies, we know how to speak many false things as though they were"
2264,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"true; but we know, when we will, to utter true things.'"
2265,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2266,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 29-35) So said the ready-voiced daughters of great Zeus, and they"
2267,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"plucked and gave me a rod, a shoot of sturdy laurel, a marvellous thing,"
2268,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and breathed into me a divine voice to celebrate things that shall be
2269,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and things there were aforetime; and they bade me sing of the race of
2270,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"the blessed gods that are eternally, but ever to sing of themselves both"
2271,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,first and last. But why all this about oak or stone? [1602]
2272,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2273,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 36-52) Come thou, let us begin with the Muses who gladden the great"
2274,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"spirit of their father Zeus in Olympus with their songs, telling"
2275,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,of things that are and that shall be and that were aforetime with
2276,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"consenting voice. Unwearying flows the sweet sound from their lips,"
2277,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and the house of their father Zeus the loud-thunderer is glad at the
2278,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"lily-like voice of the goddesses as it spread abroad, and the peaks of"
2279,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"snowy Olympus resound, and the homes of the immortals. And they uttering"
2280,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"their immortal voice, celebrate in song first of all the reverend race"
2281,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"of the gods from the beginning, those whom Earth and wide Heaven begot,"
2282,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and the gods sprung of these, givers of good things. Then, next, the"
2283,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"goddesses sing of Zeus, the father of gods and men, as they begin and"
2284,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"end their strain, how much he is the most excellent among the gods"
2285,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and supreme in power. And again, they chant the race of men and strong"
2286,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"giants, and gladden the heart of Zeus within Olympus,--the Olympian"
2287,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Muses, daughters of Zeus the aegis-holder."
2288,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2289,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 53-74) Them in Pieria did Mnemosyne (Memory), who reigns over the"
2290,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"hills of Eleuther, bear of union with the father, the son of Cronos, a"
2291,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,forgetting of ills and a rest from sorrow. For nine nights did wise Zeus
2292,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"lie with her, entering her holy bed remote from the immortals. And when"
2293,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"a year was passed and the seasons came round as the months waned, and"
2294,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"many days were accomplished, she bare nine daughters, all of one mind,"
2295,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"whose hearts are set upon song and their spirit free from care, a little"
2296,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,way from the topmost peak of snowy Olympus. There are their bright
2297,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"dancing-places and beautiful homes, and beside them the Graces and"
2298,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Himerus (Desire) live in delight. And they, uttering through their"
2299,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"lips a lovely voice, sing the laws of all and the goodly ways of the"
2300,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"immortals, uttering their lovely voice. Then went they to Olympus,"
2301,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"delighting in their sweet voice, with heavenly song, and the dark earth"
2302,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"resounded about them as they chanted, and a lovely sound rose up beneath"
2303,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"their feet as they went to their father. And he was reigning in heaven,"
2304,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"himself holding the lightning and glowing thunderbolt, when he had"
2305,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,overcome by might his father Cronos; and he distributed fairly to the
2306,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,immortals their portions and declared their privileges.
2307,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2308,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 75-103) These things, then, the Muses sang who dwell on Olympus,"
2309,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"nine daughters begotten by great Zeus, Cleio and Euterpe, Thaleia,"
2310,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Melpomene and Terpsichore, and Erato and Polyhymnia and Urania and"
2311,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Calliope [1603], who is the chiefest of them all, for she attends on"
2312,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,worshipful princes: whomsoever of heaven-nourished princes the daughters
2313,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"of great Zeus honour, and behold him at his birth, they pour sweet dew"
2314,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"upon his tongue, and from his lips flow gracious words. All the people"
2315,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"look towards him while he settles causes with true judgements: and he,"
2316,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"speaking surely, would soon make wise end even of a great quarrel; for"
2317,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"therefore are there princes wise in heart, because when the people are"
2318,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"being misguided in their assembly, they set right the matter again with"
2319,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"ease, persuading them with gentle words. And when he passes through"
2320,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"a gathering, they greet him as a god with gentle reverence, and he is"
2321,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,conspicuous amongst the assembled: such is the holy gift of the Muses to
2322,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,men. For it is through the Muses and far-shooting Apollo that there are
2323,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"singers and harpers upon the earth; but princes are of Zeus, and happy"
2324,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,is he whom the Muses love: sweet flows speech from his mouth. For though
2325,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,a man have sorrow and grief in his newly-troubled soul and live in dread
2326,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"because his heart is distressed, yet, when a singer, the servant of the"
2327,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Muses, chants the glorious deeds of men of old and the blessed gods who"
2328,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"inhabit Olympus, at once he forgets his heaviness and remembers not his"
2329,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,sorrows at all; but the gifts of the goddesses soon turn him away from
2330,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,these.
2331,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2332,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 104-115) Hail, children of Zeus! Grant lovely song and celebrate"
2333,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"the holy race of the deathless gods who are for ever, those that were"
2334,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,born of Earth and starry Heaven and gloomy Night and them that briny Sea
2335,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"did rear. Tell how at the first gods and earth came to be, and rivers,"
2336,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and the boundless sea with its raging swell, and the gleaming stars,"
2337,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and the wide heaven above, and the gods who were born of them, givers"
2338,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"of good things, and how they divided their wealth, and how they"
2339,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"shared their honours amongst them, and also how at the first they took"
2340,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"many-folded Olympus. These things declare to me from the beginning, ye"
2341,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Muses who dwell in the house of Olympus, and tell me which of them first"
2342,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,came to be.
2343,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2344,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 116-138) Verily at the first Chaos came to be, but next"
2345,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"wide-bosomed Earth, the ever-sure foundations of all [1604] the"
2346,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"deathless ones who hold the peaks of snowy Olympus, and dim Tartarus in"
2347,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"the depth of the wide-pathed Earth, and Eros (Love), fairest among the"
2348,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"deathless gods, who unnerves the limbs and overcomes the mind and wise"
2349,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,counsels of all gods and all men within them. From Chaos came forth
2350,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Erebus and black Night; but of Night were born Aether [1605] and Day,"
2351,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,whom she conceived and bare from union in love with Erebus. And Earth
2352,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"first bare starry Heaven, equal to herself, to cover her on every side,"
2353,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and to be an ever-sure abiding-place for the blessed gods. And she
2354,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"brought forth long Hills, graceful haunts of the goddess-Nymphs who"
2355,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,dwell amongst the glens of the hills. She bare also the fruitless
2356,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"deep with his raging swell, Pontus, without sweet union of love. But"
2357,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"afterwards she lay with Heaven and bare deep-swirling Oceanus, Coeus and"
2358,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Crius and Hyperion and Iapetus, Theia and Rhea, Themis and Mnemosyne and"
2359,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,gold-crowned Phoebe and lovely Tethys. After them was born Cronos the
2360,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"wily, youngest and most terrible of her children, and he hated his lusty"
2361,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,sire.
2362,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2363,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 139-146) And again, she bare the Cyclopes, overbearing in spirit,"
2364,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Brontes, and Steropes and stubborn-hearted Arges [1606], who gave Zeus"
2365,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,the thunder and made the thunderbolt: in all else they were like the
2366,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"gods, but one eye only was set in the midst of their fore-heads. And"
2367,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,they were surnamed Cyclopes (Orb-eyed) because one orbed eye was set in
2368,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,their foreheads. Strength and might and craft were in their works.
2369,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2370,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 147-163) And again, three other sons were born of Earth and"
2371,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Heaven, great and doughty beyond telling, Cottus and Briareos and Gyes,"
2372,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"presumptuous children. From their shoulders sprang an hundred arms, not"
2373,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"to be approached, and each had fifty heads upon his shoulders on their"
2374,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"strong limbs, and irresistible was the stubborn strength that was in"
2375,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,their great forms. For of all the children that were born of Earth and
2376,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Heaven, these were the most terrible, and they were hated by their own"
2377,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,father from the first.
2378,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2379,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,And he used to hide them all away in a secret place of Earth so soon as
2380,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"each was born, and would not suffer them to come up into the light: and"
2381,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Heaven rejoiced in his evil doing. But vast Earth groaned within, being"
2382,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"straitened, and she made the element of grey flint and shaped a great"
2383,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"sickle, and told her plan to her dear sons. And she spoke, cheering"
2384,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"them, while she was vexed in her dear heart:"
2385,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2386,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 164-166) 'My children, gotten of a sinful father, if you will"
2387,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"obey me, we should punish the vile outrage of your father; for he first"
2388,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,thought of doing shameful things.'
2389,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2390,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 167-169) So she said; but fear seized them all, and none of them"
2391,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,uttered a word. But great Cronos the wily took courage and answered his
2392,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,dear mother:
2393,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2394,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 170-172) 'Mother, I will undertake to do this deed, for I reverence"
2395,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"not our father of evil name, for he first thought of doing shameful"
2396,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,things.'
2397,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2398,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 173-175) So he said: and vast Earth rejoiced greatly in spirit, and"
2399,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"set and hid him in an ambush, and put in his hands a jagged sickle, and"
2400,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,revealed to him the whole plot.
2401,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2402,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 176-206) And Heaven came, bringing on night and longing for love,"
2403,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and he lay about Earth spreading himself full upon her [1607].
2404,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2405,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Then the son from his ambush stretched forth his left hand and in his
2406,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"right took the great long sickle with jagged teeth, and swiftly lopped"
2407,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,off his own father's members and cast them away to fall behind him. And
2408,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,not vainly did they fall from his hand; for all the bloody drops that
2409,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"gushed forth Earth received, and as the seasons moved round she bare the"
2410,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"strong Erinyes and the great Giants with gleaming armour, holding long"
2411,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,spears in their hands and the Nymphs whom they call Meliae [1608] all
2412,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,over the boundless earth. And so soon as he had cut off the members with
2413,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"flint and cast them from the land into the surging sea, they were swept"
2414,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,away over the main a long time: and a white foam spread around them from
2415,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"the immortal flesh, and in it there grew a maiden. First she drew near"
2416,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"holy Cythera, and from there, afterwards, she came to sea-girt Cyprus,"
2417,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and came forth an awful and lovely goddess, and grass grew up about"
2418,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"her beneath her shapely feet. Her gods and men call Aphrodite, and the"
2419,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"foam-born goddess and rich-crowned Cytherea, because she grew amid the"
2420,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"foam, and Cytherea because she reached Cythera, and Cyprogenes because"
2421,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"she was born in billowy Cyprus, and Philommedes [1609] because sprang"
2422,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"from the members. And with her went Eros, and comely Desire followed her"
2423,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,at her birth at the first and as she went into the assembly of the gods.
2424,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"This honour she has from the beginning, and this is the portion allotted"
2425,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"to her amongst men and undying gods,--the whisperings of maidens and"
2426,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,smiles and deceits with sweet delight and love and graciousness.
2427,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2428,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 207-210) But these sons whom he begot himself great Heaven used to
2429,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"call Titans (Strainers) in reproach, for he said that they strained and"
2430,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"did presumptuously a fearful deed, and that vengeance for it would come"
2431,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,afterwards.
2432,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2433,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 211-225) And Night bare hateful Doom and black Fate and Death,"
2434,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and she bare Sleep and the tribe of Dreams. And again the goddess murky
2435,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Night, though she lay with none, bare Blame and painful Woe, and the"
2436,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Hesperides who guard the rich, golden apples and the trees bearing fruit"
2437,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,beyond glorious Ocean. Also she bare the Destinies and ruthless avenging
2438,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Fates, Clotho and Lachesis and Atropos [1610], who give men at their"
2439,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"birth both evil and good to have, and they pursue the transgressions of"
2440,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,men and of gods: and these goddesses never cease from their dread anger
2441,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,until they punish the sinner with a sore penalty. Also deadly Night bare
2442,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Nemesis (Indignation) to afflict mortal men, and after her, Deceit and"
2443,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Friendship and hateful Age and hard-hearted Strife.
2444,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2445,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 226-232) But abhorred Strife bare painful Toil and Forgetfulness
2446,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and Famine and tearful Sorrows, Fightings also, Battles, Murders,"
2447,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Manslaughters, Quarrels, Lying Words, Disputes, Lawlessness and Ruin,"
2448,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"all of one nature, and Oath who most troubles men upon earth when anyone"
2449,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,wilfully swears a false oath.
2450,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2451,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 233-239) And Sea begat Nereus, the eldest of his children, who is"
2452,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,true and lies not: and men call him the Old Man because he is trusty and
2453,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"gentle and does not forget the laws of righteousness, but thinks just"
2454,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and kindly thoughts. And yet again he got great Thaumas and proud
2455,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Phorcys, being mated with Earth, and fair-cheeked Ceto and Eurybia who"
2456,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,has a heart of flint within her.
2457,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2458,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 240-264) And of Nereus and rich-haired Doris, daughter of Ocean"
2459,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"the perfect river, were born children [1611], passing lovely amongst"
2460,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"goddesses, Ploto, Eucrante, Sao, and Amphitrite, and Eudora, and Thetis,"
2461,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Galene and Glauce, Cymothoe, Speo, Thoe and lovely Halie, and Pasithea,"
2462,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and Erato, and rosy-armed Eunice, and gracious Melite, and Eulimene, and"
2463,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Agaue, Doto, Proto, Pherusa, and Dynamene, and Nisaea, and Actaea, and"
2464,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Protomedea, Doris, Panopea, and comely Galatea, and lovely Hippothoe,"
2465,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and rosy-armed Hipponoe, and Cymodoce who with Cymatolege [1612] and"
2466,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Amphitrite easily calms the waves upon the misty sea and the blasts
2467,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"of raging winds, and Cymo, and Eione, and rich-crowned Alimede, and"
2468,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Glauconome, fond of laughter, and Pontoporea, Leagore, Euagore, and"
2469,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Laomedea, and Polynoe, and Autonoe, and Lysianassa, and Euarne, lovely"
2470,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"of shape and without blemish of form, and Psamathe of charming figure"
2471,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and divine Menippe, Neso, Eupompe, Themisto, Pronoe, and Nemertes [1613]"
2472,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,who has the nature of her deathless father. These fifty daughters sprang
2473,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"from blameless Nereus, skilled in excellent crafts."
2474,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2475,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 265-269) And Thaumas wedded Electra the daughter of deep-flowing
2476,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Ocean, and she bare him swift Iris and the long-haired Harpies, Aello"
2477,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(Storm-swift) and Ocypetes (Swift-flier) who on their swift wings keep
2478,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,pace with the blasts of the winds and the birds; for quick as time they
2479,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,dart along.
2480,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2481,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll 270-294) And again, Ceto bare to Phorcys the fair-cheeked Graiae,"
2482,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,sisters grey from their birth: and both deathless gods and men who walk
2483,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"on earth call them Graiae, Pemphredo well-clad, and saffron-robed Enyo,"
2484,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and the Gorgons who dwell beyond glorious Ocean in the frontier land
2485,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"towards Night where are the clear-voiced Hesperides, Sthenno, and"
2486,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Euryale, and Medusa who suffered a woeful fate: she was mortal, but"
2487,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,the two were undying and grew not old. With her lay the Dark-haired One
2488,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,[1614] in a soft meadow amid spring flowers. And when Perseus cut off
2489,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"her head, there sprang forth great Chrysaor and the horse Pegasus who"
2490,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,is so called because he was born near the springs (pegae) of Ocean;
2491,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and that other, because he held a golden blade (aor) in his hands. Now"
2492,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Pegasus flew away and left the earth, the mother of flocks, and came"
2493,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,to the deathless gods: and he dwells in the house of Zeus and brings to
2494,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,wise Zeus the thunder and lightning. But Chrysaor was joined in love
2495,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"to Callirrhoe, the daughter of glorious Ocean, and begot three-headed"
2496,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Geryones. Him mighty Heracles slew in sea-girt Erythea by his shambling
2497,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"oxen on that day when he drove the wide-browed oxen to holy Tiryns,"
2498,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and had crossed the ford of Ocean and killed Orthus and Eurytion the
2499,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,herdsman in the dim stead out beyond glorious Ocean.
2500,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2501,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 295-305) And in a hollow cave she bare another monster,"
2502,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"irresistible, in no wise like either to mortal men or to the undying"
2503,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"gods, even the goddess fierce Echidna who is half a nymph with glancing"
2504,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"eyes and fair cheeks, and half again a huge snake, great and awful, with"
2505,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"speckled skin, eating raw flesh beneath the secret parts of the holy"
2506,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,earth. And there she has a cave deep down under a hollow rock far from
2507,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"the deathless gods and mortal men. There, then, did the gods appoint her"
2508,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,a glorious house to dwell in: and she keeps guard in Arima beneath the
2509,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"earth, grim Echidna, a nymph who dies not nor grows old all her days."
2510,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2511,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 306-332) Men say that Typhaon the terrible, outrageous and lawless,"
2512,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"was joined in love to her, the maid with glancing eyes. So she conceived"
2513,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and brought forth fierce offspring; first she bare Orthus the hound of
2514,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Geryones, and then again she bare a second, a monster not to be"
2515,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"overcome and that may not be described, Cerberus who eats raw flesh, the"
2516,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"brazen-voiced hound of Hades, fifty-headed, relentless and strong."
2517,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"And again she bore a third, the evil-minded Hydra of Lerna, whom the"
2518,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"goddess, white-armed Hera nourished, being angry beyond measure with"
2519,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"the mighty Heracles. And her Heracles, the son of Zeus, of the house of"
2520,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Amphitryon, together with warlike Iolaus, destroyed with the unpitying"
2521,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,sword through the plans of Athene the spoil-driver. She was the mother
2522,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"of Chimaera who breathed raging fire, a creature fearful, great,"
2523,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"swift-footed and strong, who had three heads, one of a grim-eyed lion;"
2524,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"in her hinderpart, a dragon; and in her middle, a goat, breathing forth"
2525,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,a fearful blast of blazing fire. Her did Pegasus and noble Bellerophon
2526,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,slay; but Echidna was subject in love to Orthus and brought forth the
2527,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"deadly Sphinx which destroyed the Cadmeans, and the Nemean lion, which"
2528,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Hera, the good wife of Zeus, brought up and made to haunt the hills"
2529,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"of Nemea, a plague to men. There he preyed upon the tribes of her own"
2530,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,people and had power over Tretus of Nemea and Apesas: yet the strength
2531,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,of stout Heracles overcame him.
2532,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2533,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 333-336) And Ceto was joined in love to Phorcys and bare her
2534,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"youngest, the awful snake who guards the apples all of gold in the"
2535,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,secret places of the dark earth at its great bounds. This is the
2536,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,offspring of Ceto and Phorcys.
2537,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2538,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 334-345) And Tethys bare to Ocean eddying rivers, Nilus, and"
2539,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Alpheus, and deep-swirling Eridanus, Strymon, and Meander, and the"
2540,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"fair stream of Ister, and Phasis, and Rhesus, and the silver eddies of"
2541,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Achelous, Nessus, and Rhodius, Haliacmon, and Heptaporus, Granicus,"
2542,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and Aesepus, and holy Simois, and Peneus, and Hermus, and Caicus fair"
2543,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"stream, and great Sangarius, Ladon, Parthenius, Euenus, Ardescus, and"
2544,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,divine Scamander.
2545,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2546,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 346-370) Also she brought forth a holy company of daughters [1615]
2547,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,who with the lord Apollo and the Rivers have youths in their keeping--to
2548,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"this charge Zeus appointed them--Peitho, and Admete, and Ianthe, and"
2549,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Electra, and Doris, and Prymno, and Urania divine in form, Hippo,"
2550,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Clymene, Rhodea, and Callirrhoe, Zeuxo and Clytie, and Idyia, and"
2551,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Pasithoe, Plexaura, and Galaxaura, and lovely Dione, Melobosis and Thoe"
2552,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and handsome Polydora, Cerceis lovely of form, and soft eyed Pluto,"
2553,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Perseis, Ianeira, Acaste, Xanthe, Petraea the fair, Menestho, and"
2554,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Europa, Metis, and Eurynome, and Telesto saffron-clad, Chryseis and Asia"
2555,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and charming Calypso, Eudora, and Tyche, Amphirho, and Ocyrrhoe, and"
2556,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Styx who is the chiefest of them all. These are the eldest daughters
2557,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,that sprang from Ocean and Tethys; but there are many besides. For there
2558,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,are three thousand neat-ankled daughters of Ocean who are dispersed far
2559,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and wide, and in every place alike serve the earth and the deep waters,"
2560,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,children who are glorious among goddesses. And as many other rivers are
2561,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"there, babbling as they flow, sons of Ocean, whom queenly Tethys bare,"
2562,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"but their names it is hard for a mortal man to tell, but people know"
2563,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,those by which they severally dwell.
2564,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2565,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 371-374) And Theia was subject in love to Hyperion and bare great
2566,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Helius (Sun) and clear Selene (Moon) and Eos (Dawn) who shines upon
2567,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,all that are on earth and upon the deathless Gods who live in the wide
2568,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,heaven.
2569,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2570,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 375-377) And Eurybia, bright goddess, was joined in love to Crius"
2571,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and bare great Astraeus, and Pallas, and Perses who also was eminent"
2572,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,among all men in wisdom.
2573,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2574,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 378-382) And Eos bare to Astraeus the strong-hearted winds,"
2575,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"brightening Zephyrus, and Boreas, headlong in his course, and Notus,--a"
2576,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,goddess mating in love with a god. And after these Erigenia [1616] bare
2577,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"the star Eosphorus (Dawn-bringer), and the gleaming stars with which"
2578,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,heaven is crowned.
2579,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2580,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 383-403) And Styx the daughter of Ocean was joined to Pallas and
2581,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,bare Zelus (Emulation) and trim-ankled Nike (Victory) in the house. Also
2582,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"she brought forth Cratos (Strength) and Bia (Force), wonderful children."
2583,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"These have no house apart from Zeus, nor any dwelling nor path except"
2584,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"that wherein God leads them, but they dwell always with Zeus the"
2585,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,loud-thunderer. For so did Styx the deathless daughter of Ocean plan on
2586,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,that day when the Olympian Lightener called all the deathless gods to
2587,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"great Olympus, and said that whosoever of the gods would fight with him"
2588,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"against the Titans, he would not cast him out from his rights, but each"
2589,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,should have the office which he had before amongst the deathless gods.
2590,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"And he declared that he who was without office and rights under Cronos,"
2591,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,should be raised to both office and rights as is just. So
2592,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,deathless Styx came first to Olympus with her children through the
2593,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"wit of her dear father. And Zeus honoured her, and gave her very great"
2594,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"gifts, for her he appointed to be the great oath of the gods, and her"
2595,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"children to live with him always. And as he promised, so he performed"
2596,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,fully unto them all. But he himself mightily reigns and rules.
2597,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2598,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 404-452) Again, Phoebe came to the desired embrace of Coeus."
2599,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2600,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Then the goddess through the love of the god conceived and brought forth
2601,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"dark-gowned Leto, always mild, kind to men and to the deathless gods,"
2602,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"mild from the beginning, gentlest in all Olympus. Also she bare Asteria"
2603,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"of happy name, whom Perses once led to his great house to be called his"
2604,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,dear wife. And she conceived and bare Hecate whom Zeus the son of Cronos
2605,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"honoured above all. He gave her splendid gifts, to have a share of the"
2606,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"earth and the unfruitful sea. She received honour also in starry heaven,"
2607,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and is honoured exceedingly by the deathless gods. For to this day,"
2608,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,whenever any one of men on earth offers rich sacrifices and prays for
2609,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"favour according to custom, he calls upon Hecate. Great honour comes"
2610,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"full easily to him whose prayers the goddess receives favourably, and"
2611,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,she bestows wealth upon him; for the power surely is with her. For as
2612,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,many as were born of Earth and Ocean amongst all these she has her due
2613,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,portion. The son of Cronos did her no wrong nor took anything away of
2614,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"all that was her portion among the former Titan gods: but she holds,"
2615,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"as the division was at the first from the beginning, privilege both in"
2616,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"earth, and in heaven, and in sea. Also, because she is an only child,"
2617,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"the goddess receives not less honour, but much more still, for Zeus"
2618,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,honours her. Whom she will she greatly aids and advances: she sits by
2619,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"worshipful kings in judgement, and in the assembly whom she will is"
2620,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,distinguished among the people. And when men arm themselves for the
2621,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"battle that destroys men, then the goddess is at hand to give victory"
2622,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and grant glory readily to whom she will. Good is she also when men
2623,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"contend at the games, for there too the goddess is with them and profits"
2624,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,them: and he who by might and strength gets the victory wins the rich
2625,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"prize easily with joy, and brings glory to his parents. And she is good"
2626,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"to stand by horsemen, whom she will: and to those whose business is"
2627,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"in the grey discomfortable sea, and who pray to Hecate and the"
2628,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"loud-crashing Earth-Shaker, easily the glorious goddess gives great"
2629,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"catch, and easily she takes it away as soon as seen, if so she will."
2630,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,She is good in the byre with Hermes to increase the stock. The droves
2631,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"of kine and wide herds of goats and flocks of fleecy sheep, if she will,"
2632,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"she increases from a few, or makes many to be less. So, then. albeit her"
2633,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"mother's only child [1617], she is honoured amongst all the deathless"
2634,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,gods. And the son of Cronos made her a nurse of the young who after
2635,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,that day saw with their eyes the light of all-seeing Dawn. So from the
2636,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"beginning she is a nurse of the young, and these are her honours."
2637,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2638,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 453-491) But Rhea was subject in love to Cronos and bare splendid
2639,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"children, Hestia [1618], Demeter, and gold-shod Hera and strong Hades,"
2640,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"pitiless in heart, who dwells under the earth, and the loud-crashing"
2641,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Earth-Shaker, and wise Zeus, father of gods and men, by whose thunder"
2642,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,the wide earth is shaken. These great Cronos swallowed as each came
2643,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"forth from the womb to his mother's knees with this intent, that no"
2644,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,other of the proud sons of Heaven should hold the kingly office amongst
2645,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,the deathless gods. For he learned from Earth and starry Heaven that
2646,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"he was destined to be overcome by his own son, strong though he was,"
2647,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,through the contriving of great Zeus [1619]. Therefore he kept no blind
2648,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"outlook, but watched and swallowed down his children: and unceasing"
2649,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"grief seized Rhea. But when she was about to bear Zeus, the father of"
2650,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"gods and men, then she besought her own dear parents, Earth and starry"
2651,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Heaven, to devise some plan with her that the birth of her dear child"
2652,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"might be concealed, and that retribution might overtake great, crafty"
2653,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Cronos for his own father and also for the children whom he had
2654,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"swallowed down. And they readily heard and obeyed their dear daughter,"
2655,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and told her all that was destined to happen touching Cronos the king
2656,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and his stout-hearted son. So they sent her to Lyetus, to the rich land"
2657,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"of Crete, when she was ready to bear great Zeus, the youngest of her"
2658,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,children. Him did vast Earth receive from Rhea in wide Crete to nourish
2659,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and to bring up. Thither came Earth carrying him swiftly through the
2660,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"black night to Lyctus first, and took him in her arms and hid him in a"
2661,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,remote cave beneath the secret places of the holy earth on thick-wooded
2662,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Mount Aegeum; but to the mightily ruling son of Heaven, the earlier king"
2663,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"of the gods, she gave a great stone wrapped in swaddling clothes. Then"
2664,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,he took it in his hands and thrust it down into his belly: wretch!
2665,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,he knew not in his heart that in place of the stone his son was left
2666,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"behind, unconquered and untroubled, and that he was soon to overcome him"
2667,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"by force and might and drive him from his honours, himself to reign over"
2668,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,the deathless gods.
2669,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2670,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 492-506) After that, the strength and glorious limbs of the prince"
2671,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"increased quickly, and as the years rolled on, great Cronos the wily"
2672,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"was beguiled by the deep suggestions of Earth, and brought up again"
2673,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"his offspring, vanquished by the arts and might of his own son, and he"
2674,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,vomited up first the stone which he had swallowed last. And Zeus set
2675,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,it fast in the wide-pathed earth at goodly Pytho under the glens of
2676,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Parnassus, to be a sign thenceforth and a marvel to mortal men [1620]."
2677,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"And he set free from their deadly bonds the brothers of his father,"
2678,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,sons of Heaven whom his father in his foolishness had bound. And they
2679,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"remembered to be grateful to him for his kindness, and gave him thunder"
2680,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and the glowing thunderbolt and lightening: for before that, huge"
2681,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Earth had hidden these. In them he trusts and rules over mortals and
2682,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,immortals.
2683,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2684,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 507-543) Now Iapetus took to wife the neat-ankled mad Clymene,"
2685,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"daughter of Ocean, and went up with her into one bed. And she bare him"
2686,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"a stout-hearted son, Atlas: also she bare very glorious Menoetius and"
2687,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"clever Prometheus, full of various wiles, and scatter-brained Epimetheus"
2688,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,who from the first was a mischief to men who eat bread; for it was he
2689,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"who first took of Zeus the woman, the maiden whom he had formed. But"
2690,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Menoetius was outrageous, and far-seeing Zeus struck him with a lurid"
2691,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,thunderbolt and sent him down to Erebus because of his mad presumption
2692,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and exceeding pride. And Atlas through hard constraint upholds the wide
2693,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"heaven with unwearying head and arms, standing at the borders of"
2694,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,the earth before the clear-voiced Hesperides; for this lot wise Zeus
2695,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,assigned to him. And ready-witted Prometheus he bound with inextricable
2696,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"bonds, cruel chains, and drove a shaft through his middle, and set on"
2697,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"him a long-winged eagle, which used to eat his immortal liver; but by"
2698,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,night the liver grew as much again everyway as the long-winged bird
2699,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"devoured in the whole day. That bird Heracles, the valiant son of"
2700,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"shapely-ankled Alcmene, slew; and delivered the son of Iapetus from the"
2701,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"cruel plague, and released him from his affliction--not without the"
2702,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"will of Olympian Zeus who reigns on high, that the glory of Heracles the"
2703,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Theban-born might be yet greater than it was before over the plenteous
2704,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"earth. This, then, he regarded, and honoured his famous son; though"
2705,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"he was angry, he ceased from the wrath which he had before because"
2706,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Prometheus matched himself in wit with the almighty son of Cronos.
2707,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"For when the gods and mortal men had a dispute at Mecone, even then"
2708,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Prometheus was forward to cut up a great ox and set portions before
2709,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"them, trying to befool the mind of Zeus. Before the rest he set flesh"
2710,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and inner parts thick with fat upon the hide, covering them with an ox"
2711,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,paunch; but for Zeus he put the white bones dressed up with cunning art
2712,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and covered with shining fat. Then the father of men and of gods said to
2713,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,him:
2714,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2715,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 543-544) 'Son of Iapetus, most glorious of all lords, good sir, how"
2716,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,unfairly you have divided the portions!'
2717,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2718,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 545-547) So said Zeus whose wisdom is everlasting, rebuking him."
2719,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"But wily Prometheus answered him, smiling softly and not forgetting his"
2720,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,cunning trick:
2721,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2722,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 548-558) 'Zeus, most glorious and greatest of the eternal gods,"
2723,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,take which ever of these portions your heart within you bids.' So he
2724,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"said, thinking trickery. But Zeus, whose wisdom is everlasting, saw and"
2725,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"failed not to perceive the trick, and in his heart he thought mischief"
2726,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,against mortal men which also was to be fulfilled. With both hands he
2727,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"took up the white fat and was angry at heart, and wrath came to his"
2728,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,spirit when he saw the white ox-bones craftily tricked out: and because
2729,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,of this the tribes of men upon earth burn white bones to the deathless
2730,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,gods upon fragrant altars. But Zeus who drives the clouds was greatly
2731,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,vexed and said to him:
2732,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2733,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 559-560) 'Son of Iapetus, clever above all! So, sir, you have not"
2734,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,yet forgotten your cunning arts!'
2735,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2736,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 561-584) So spake Zeus in anger, whose wisdom is everlasting; and"
2737,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"from that time he was always mindful of the trick, and would not give"
2738,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,the power of unwearying fire to the Melian [1621] race of mortal men who
2739,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,live on the earth. But the noble son of Iapetus outwitted him and stole
2740,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,the far-seen gleam of unwearying fire in a hollow fennel stalk. And Zeus
2741,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"who thunders on high was stung in spirit, and his dear heart was angered"
2742,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,when he saw amongst men the far-seen ray of fire. Forthwith he made an
2743,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,evil thing for men as the price of fire; for the very famous Limping
2744,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,God formed of earth the likeness of a shy maiden as the son of Cronos
2745,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,willed. And the goddess bright-eyed Athene girded and clothed her with
2746,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"silvery raiment, and down from her head she spread with her hands a"
2747,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"broidered veil, a wonder to see; and she, Pallas Athene, put about her"
2748,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"head lovely garlands, flowers of new-grown herbs. Also she put upon her"
2749,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,head a crown of gold which the very famous Limping God made himself and
2750,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,worked with his own hands as a favour to Zeus his father. On it was much
2751,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"curious work, wonderful to see; for of the many creatures which the"
2752,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"land and sea rear up, he put most upon it, wonderful things, like living"
2753,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,beings with voices: and great beauty shone out from it.
2754,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2755,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 585-589) But when he had made the beautiful evil to be the price
2756,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"for the blessing, he brought her out, delighting in the finery which"
2757,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"the bright-eyed daughter of a mighty father had given her, to the place"
2758,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,where the other gods and men were. And wonder took hold of the deathless
2759,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"gods and mortal men when they saw that which was sheer guile, not to be"
2760,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,withstood by men.
2761,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2762,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 590-612) For from her is the race of women and female kind: of her
2763,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,is the deadly race and tribe of women who live amongst mortal men
2764,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"to their great trouble, no helpmeets in hateful poverty, but only in"
2765,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,wealth. And as in thatched hives bees feed the drones whose nature is to
2766,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,do mischief--by day and throughout the day until the sun goes down the
2767,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"bees are busy and lay the white combs, while the drones stay at home"
2768,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,in the covered skeps and reap the toil of others into their own
2769,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,bellies--even so Zeus who thunders on high made women to be an evil to
2770,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"mortal men, with a nature to do evil. And he gave them a second evil"
2771,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,to be the price for the good they had: whoever avoids marriage and
2772,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"the sorrows that women cause, and will not wed, reaches deadly old age"
2773,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"without anyone to tend his years, and though he at least has no lack of"
2774,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"livelihood while he lives, yet, when he is dead, his kinsfolk divide"
2775,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,his possessions amongst them. And as for the man who chooses the lot
2776,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"of marriage and takes a good wife suited to his mind, evil continually"
2777,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"contends with good; for whoever happens to have mischievous children,"
2778,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,lives always with unceasing grief in his spirit and heart within him;
2779,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and this evil cannot be healed.
2780,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2781,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 613-616) So it is not possible to deceive or go beyond the will of
2782,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Zeus; for not even the son of Iapetus, kindly Prometheus, escaped his"
2783,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"heavy anger, but of necessity strong bands confined him, although he"
2784,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,knew many a wile.
2785,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2786,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 617-643) But when first their father was vexed in his heart with
2787,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Obriareus and Cottus and Gyes, he bound them in cruel bonds, because he"
2788,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,was jealous of their exceeding manhood and comeliness and great size:
2789,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and he made them live beneath the wide-pathed earth, where they were"
2790,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"afflicted, being set to dwell under the ground, at the end of the earth,"
2791,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"at its great borders, in bitter anguish for a long time and with great"
2792,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,grief at heart. But the son of Cronos and the other deathless gods whom
2793,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"rich-haired Rhea bare from union with Cronos, brought them up again to"
2794,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,the light at Earth's advising. For she herself recounted all things
2795,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"to the gods fully, how that with these they would gain victory and a"
2796,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,glorious cause to vaunt themselves. For the Titan gods and as many as
2797,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,sprang from Cronos had long been fighting together in stubborn war with
2798,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"heart-grieving toil, the lordly Titans from high Othyrs, but the gods,"
2799,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"givers of good, whom rich-haired Rhea bare in union with Cronos, from"
2800,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Olympus. So they, with bitter wrath, were fighting continually with"
2801,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"one another at that time for ten full years, and the hard strife had"
2802,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"no close or end for either side, and the issue of the war hung evenly"
2803,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"balanced. But when he had provided those three with all things fitting,"
2804,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"nectar and ambrosia which the gods themselves eat, and when their"
2805,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,proud spirit revived within them all after they had fed on nectar and
2806,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"delicious ambrosia, then it was that the father of men and gods spoke"
2807,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,amongst them:
2808,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2809,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 644-653) 'Hear me, bright children of Earth and Heaven, that I"
2810,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"may say what my heart within me bids. A long while now have we, who are"
2811,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"sprung from Cronos and the Titan gods, fought with each other every"
2812,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,day to get victory and to prevail. But do you show your great might
2813,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and unconquerable strength, and face the Titans in bitter strife; for"
2814,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"remember our friendly kindness, and from what sufferings you are come"
2815,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,back to the light from your cruel bondage under misty gloom through our
2816,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,counsels.'
2817,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2818,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 654-663) So he said. And blameless Cottus answered him again:
2819,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"'Divine one, you speak that which we know well: nay, even of ourselves"
2820,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"we know that your wisdom and understanding is exceeding, and that you"
2821,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,became a defender of the deathless ones from chill doom. And through
2822,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,your devising we are come back again from the murky gloom and from our
2823,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"merciless bonds, enjoying what we looked not for, O lord, son of Cronos."
2824,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,And so now with fixed purpose and deliberate counsel we will aid your
2825,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,power in dreadful strife and will fight against the Titans in hard
2826,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,battle.'
2827,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2828,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 664-686) So he said: and the gods, givers of good things, applauded"
2829,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"when they heard his word, and their spirit longed for war even more than"
2830,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"before, and they all, both male and female, stirred up hated battle"
2831,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"that day, the Titan gods, and all that were born of Cronos together with"
2832,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"those dread, mighty ones of overwhelming strength whom Zeus brought up"
2833,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,to the light from Erebus beneath the earth. An hundred arms sprang from
2834,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"the shoulders of all alike, and each had fifty heads growing upon his"
2835,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"shoulders upon stout limbs. These, then, stood against the Titans in"
2836,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"grim strife, holding huge rocks in their strong hands. And on the other"
2837,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"part the Titans eagerly strengthened their ranks, and both sides at one"
2838,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,time showed the work of their hands and their might. The boundless sea
2839,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"rang terribly around, and the earth crashed loudly: wide Heaven was"
2840,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"shaken and groaned, and high Olympus reeled from its foundation under"
2841,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"the charge of the undying gods, and a heavy quaking reached dim Tartarus"
2842,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and the deep sound of their feet in the fearful onset and of their
2843,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"hard missiles. So, then, they launched their grievous shafts upon one"
2844,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"another, and the cry of both armies as they shouted reached to starry"
2845,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,heaven; and they met together with a great battle-cry.
2846,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2847,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 687-712) Then Zeus no longer held back his might; but straight his
2848,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,heart was filled with fury and he showed forth all his strength. From
2849,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Heaven and from Olympus he came forthwith, hurling his lightning: the"
2850,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,bolts flew thick and fast from his strong hand together with thunder
2851,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and lightning, whirling an awesome flame. The life-giving earth crashed"
2852,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"around in burning, and the vast wood crackled loud with fire all about."
2853,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"All the land seethed, and Ocean's streams and the unfruitful sea. The"
2854,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,hot vapour lapped round the earthborn Titans: flame unspeakable rose
2855,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,to the bright upper air: the flashing glare of the thunder-stone and
2856,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,lightning blinded their eyes for all that there were strong. Astounding
2857,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,heat seized Chaos: and to see with eyes and to hear the sound with ears
2858,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,it seemed even as if Earth and wide Heaven above came together; for such
2859,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"a mighty crash would have arisen if Earth were being hurled to ruin, and"
2860,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Heaven from on high were hurling her down; so great a crash was there
2861,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,while the gods were meeting together in strife. Also the winds brought
2862,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"rumbling earthquake and duststorm, thunder and lightning and the"
2863,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"lurid thunderbolt, which are the shafts of great Zeus, and carried the"
2864,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,clangour and the warcry into the midst of the two hosts. An horrible
2865,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,uproar of terrible strife arose: mighty deeds were shown and the
2866,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"battle inclined. But until then, they kept at one another and fought"
2867,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,continually in cruel war.
2868,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2869,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 713-735) And amongst the foremost Cottus and Briareos and Gyes
2870,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"insatiate for war raised fierce fighting: three hundred rocks, one upon"
2871,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"another, they launched from their strong hands and overshadowed the"
2872,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Titans with their missiles, and buried them beneath the wide-pathed"
2873,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"earth, and bound them in bitter chains when they had conquered them by"
2874,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"their strength for all their great spirit, as far beneath the earth to"
2875,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Tartarus. For a brazen anvil falling down from heaven nine nights and
2876,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"days would reach the earth upon the tenth: and again, a brazen anvil"
2877,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,falling from earth nine nights and days would reach Tartarus upon the
2878,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"tenth. Round it runs a fence of bronze, and night spreads in triple"
2879,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"line all about it like a neck-circlet, while above grow the roots of the"
2880,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,earth and unfruitful sea. There by the counsel of Zeus who drives the
2881,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"clouds the Titan gods are hidden under misty gloom, in a dank place"
2882,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,where are the ends of the huge earth. And they may not go out; for
2883,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Poseidon fixed gates of bronze upon it, and a wall runs all round it"
2884,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"on every side. There Gyes and Cottus and great-souled Obriareus live,"
2885,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,trusty warders of Zeus who holds the aegis.
2886,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2887,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 736-744) And there, all in their order, are the sources and ends"
2888,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,of gloomy earth and misty Tartarus and the unfruitful sea and starry
2889,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"heaven, loathsome and dank, which even the gods abhor."
2890,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2891,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"It is a great gulf, and if once a man were within the gates, he would"
2892,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"not reach the floor until a whole year had reached its end, but cruel"
2893,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,blast upon blast would carry him this way and that. And this marvel is
2894,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,awful even to the deathless gods.
2895,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2896,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 744-757) There stands the awful home of murky Night wrapped in
2897,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,dark clouds. In front of it the son of Iapetus [1622] stands immovably
2898,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"upholding the wide heaven upon his head and unwearying hands, where"
2899,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Night and Day draw near and greet one another as they pass the great
2900,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,threshold of bronze: and while the one is about to go down into the
2901,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"house, the other comes out at the door."
2902,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2903,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,And the house never holds them both within; but always one is without
2904,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"the house passing over the earth, while the other stays at home"
2905,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and waits until the time for her journeying come; and the one holds
2906,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"all-seeing light for them on earth, but the other holds in her arms"
2907,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Sleep the brother of Death, even evil Night, wrapped in a vaporous"
2908,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,cloud.
2909,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2910,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 758-766) And there the children of dark Night have their dwellings,"
2911,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Sleep and Death, awful gods. The glowing Sun never looks upon them with"
2912,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"his beams, neither as he goes up into heaven, nor as he comes down from"
2913,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,heaven. And the former of them roams peacefully over the earth and the
2914,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,sea's broad back and is kindly to men; but the other has a heart of
2915,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"iron, and his spirit within him is pitiless as bronze: whomsoever of"
2916,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,men he has once seized he holds fast: and he is hateful even to the
2917,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,deathless gods.
2918,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2919,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 767-774) There, in front, stand the echoing halls of the god of"
2920,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"the lower-world, strong Hades, and of awful Persephone. A fearful hound"
2921,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"guards the house in front, pitiless, and he has a cruel trick. On those"
2922,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"who go in he fawns with his tail and both his ears, but suffers them not"
2923,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"to go out back again, but keeps watch and devours whomsoever he catches"
2924,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,going out of the gates of strong Hades and awful Persephone.
2925,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2926,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 775-806) And there dwells the goddess loathed by the deathless
2927,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"gods, terrible Styx, eldest daughter of back-flowing [1623] Ocean. She"
2928,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,lives apart from the gods in her glorious house vaulted over with great
2929,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,rocks and propped up to heaven all round with silver pillars. Rarely
2930,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"does the daughter of Thaumas, swift-footed Iris, come to her with a"
2931,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,message over the sea's wide back.
2932,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2933,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"But when strife and quarrel arise among the deathless gods, and when any"
2934,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"of them who live in the house of Olympus lies, then Zeus sends Iris"
2935,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"to bring in a golden jug the great oath of the gods from far away, the"
2936,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,famous cold water which trickles down from a high and beetling rock. Far
2937,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,under the wide-pathed earth a branch of Oceanus flows through the dark
2938,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"night out of the holy stream, and a tenth part of his water is allotted"
2939,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,to her. With nine silver-swirling streams he winds about the earth and
2940,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"the sea's wide back, and then falls into the main [1624]; but the tenth"
2941,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"flows out from a rock, a sore trouble to the gods. For whoever of the"
2942,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,deathless gods that hold the peaks of snowy Olympus pours a libation of
2943,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"her water is forsworn, lies breathless until a full year is completed,"
2944,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and never comes near to taste ambrosia and nectar, but lies spiritless"
2945,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and voiceless on a strewn bed: and a heavy trance overshadows him. But
2946,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"when he has spent a long year in his sickness, another penance and an"
2947,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,harder follows after the first. For nine years he is cut off from the
2948,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"eternal gods and never joins their councils of their feasts, nine full"
2949,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,years. But in the tenth year he comes again to join the assemblies of
2950,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"the deathless gods who live in the house of Olympus. Such an oath, then,"
2951,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,did the gods appoint the eternal and primaeval water of Styx to be: and
2952,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,it spouts through a rugged place.
2953,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2954,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 807-819) And there, all in their order, are the sources and ends"
2955,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,of the dark earth and misty Tartarus and the unfruitful sea and starry
2956,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"heaven, loathsome and dank, which even the gods abhor."
2957,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2958,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,And there are shining gates and an immoveable threshold of bronze having
2959,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"unending roots and it is grown of itself [1625]. And beyond, away from"
2960,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"all the gods, live the Titans, beyond gloomy Chaos. But the glorious"
2961,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,allies of loud-crashing Zeus have their dwelling upon Ocean's
2962,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"foundations, even Cottus and Gyes; but Briareos, being goodly, the"
2963,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"deep-roaring Earth-Shaker made his son-in-law, giving him Cymopolea his"
2964,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,daughter to wed.
2965,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
2966,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 820-868) But when Zeus had driven the Titans from heaven, huge"
2967,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Earth bare her youngest child Typhoeus of the love of Tartarus, by the"
2968,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,aid of golden Aphrodite. Strength was with his hands in all that he did
2969,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and the feet of the strong god were untiring. From his shoulders grew
2970,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"an hundred heads of a snake, a fearful dragon, with dark, flickering"
2971,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"tongues, and from under the brows of his eyes in his marvellous heads"
2972,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"flashed fire, and fire burned from his heads as he glared. And there"
2973,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,were voices in all his dreadful heads which uttered every kind of
2974,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,sound unspeakable; for at one time they made sounds such that the gods
2975,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"understood, but at another, the noise of a bull bellowing aloud in proud"
2976,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"ungovernable fury; and at another, the sound of a lion, relentless of"
2977,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"heart; and at another, sounds like whelps, wonderful to hear; and again,"
2978,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"at another, he would hiss, so that the high mountains re-echoed. And"
2979,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"truly a thing past help would have happened on that day, and he would"
2980,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"have come to reign over mortals and immortals, had not the father of men"
2981,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and gods been quick to perceive it. But he thundered hard and mightily:
2982,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and the earth around resounded terribly and the wide heaven above, and"
2983,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,the sea and Ocean's streams and the nether parts of the earth. Great
2984,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Olympus reeled beneath the divine feet of the king as he arose and
2985,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,earth groaned thereat. And through the two of them heat took hold on the
2986,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"dark-blue sea, through the thunder and lightning, and through the fire"
2987,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"from the monster, and the scorching winds and blazing thunderbolt. The"
2988,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"whole earth seethed, and sky and sea: and the long waves raged along the"
2989,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"beaches round and about, at the rush of the deathless gods: and there"
2990,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,arose an endless shaking. Hades trembled where he rules over the dead
2991,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"below, and the Titans under Tartarus who live with Cronos, because of"
2992,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,the unending clamour and the fearful strife. So when Zeus had raised
2993,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"up his might and seized his arms, thunder and lightning and lurid"
2994,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"thunderbolt, he leaped from Olympus and struck him, and burned all the"
2995,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,marvellous heads of the monster about him. But when Zeus had conquered
2996,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"him and lashed him with strokes, Typhoeus was hurled down, a maimed"
2997,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"wreck, so that the huge earth groaned. And flame shot forth from the"
2998,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"thunder-stricken lord in the dim rugged glens of the mount [1626], when"
2999,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,he was smitten. A great part of huge earth was scorched by the terrible
3000,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,vapour and melted as tin melts when heated by men's art in channelled
3001,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"[1627] crucibles; or as iron, which is hardest of all things, is"
3002,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,softened by glowing fire in mountain glens and melts in the divine earth
3003,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"through the strength of Hephaestus [1628]. Even so, then, the earth"
3004,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,melted in the glow of the blazing fire. And in the bitterness of his
3005,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,anger Zeus cast him into wide Tartarus.
3006,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
3007,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 869-880) And from Typhoeus come boisterous winds which blow damply,"
3008,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"except Notus and Boreas and clear Zephyr. These are a god-sent kind,"
3009,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and a great blessing to men; but the others blow fitfully upon the seas.
3010,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Some rush upon the misty sea and work great havoc among men with their
3011,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"evil, raging blasts; for varying with the season they blow, scattering"
3012,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,ships and destroying sailors. And men who meet these upon the sea have
3013,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"no help against the mischief. Others again over the boundless, flowering"
3014,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"earth spoil the fair fields of men who dwell below, filling them with"
3015,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,dust and cruel uproar.
3016,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
3017,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 881-885) But when the blessed gods had finished their toil, and"
3018,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"settled by force their struggle for honours with the Titans, they"
3019,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"pressed far-seeing Olympian Zeus to reign and to rule over them, by"
3020,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Earth's prompting. So he divided their dignities amongst them.
3021,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
3022,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 886-900) Now Zeus, king of the gods, made Metis his wife first,"
3023,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and she was wisest among gods and mortal men. But when she was about to
3024,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"bring forth the goddess bright-eyed Athene, Zeus craftily deceived her"
3025,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"with cunning words and put her in his own belly, as Earth and starry"
3026,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Heaven advised. For they advised him so, to the end that no other should"
3027,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,hold royal sway over the eternal gods in place of Zeus; for very wise
3028,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"children were destined to be born of her, first the maiden bright-eyed"
3029,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Tritogeneia, equal to her father in strength and in wise understanding;"
3030,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"but afterwards she was to bear a son of overbearing spirit, king of gods"
3031,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and men. But Zeus put her into his own belly first, that the goddess"
3032,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,might devise for him both good and evil.
3033,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
3034,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 901-906) Next he married bright Themis who bare the Horae (Hours),"
3035,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and Eunomia (Order), Dike (Justice), and blooming Eirene (Peace), who"
3036,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"mind the works of mortal men, and the Moerae (Fates) to whom wise Zeus"
3037,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"gave the greatest honour, Clotho, and Lachesis, and Atropos who give"
3038,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,mortal men evil and good to have.
3039,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
3040,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 907-911) And Eurynome, the daughter of Ocean, beautiful in form,"
3041,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"bare him three fair-cheeked Charites (Graces), Aglaea, and Euphrosyne,"
3042,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and lovely Thaleia, from whose eyes as they glanced flowed love that"
3043,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,unnerves the limbs: and beautiful is their glance beneath their brows.
3044,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
3045,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 912-914) Also he came to the bed of all-nourishing Demeter, and she"
3046,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,bare white-armed Persephone whom Aidoneus carried off from her mother;
3047,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,but wise Zeus gave her to him.
3048,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
3049,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 915-917) And again, he loved Mnemosyne with the beautiful hair: and"
3050,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,of her the nine gold-crowned Muses were born who delight in feasts and
3051,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,the pleasures of song.
3052,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
3053,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 918-920) And Leto was joined in love with Zeus who holds the aegis,"
3054,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and bare Apollo and Artemis delighting in arrows, children lovely above"
3055,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,all the sons of Heaven.
3056,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
3057,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 921-923) Lastly, he made Hera his blooming wife: and she was joined"
3058,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"in love with the king of gods and men, and brought forth Hebe and Ares"
3059,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and Eileithyia.
3060,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
3061,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 924-929) But Zeus himself gave birth from his own head to
3062,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"bright-eyed Tritogeneia [1629], the awful, the strife-stirring, the"
3063,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"host-leader, the unwearying, the queen, who delights in tumults and wars"
3064,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and battles. But Hera without union with Zeus--for she was very angry
3065,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"and quarrelled with her mate--bare famous Hephaestus, who is skilled in"
3066,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,crafts more than all the sons of Heaven.
3067,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
3068,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 929a-929t) [1630] But Hera was very angry and quarrelled with her
3069,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,mate. And because of this strife she bare without union with Zeus who
3070,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"holds the aegis a glorious son, Hephaestus, who excelled all the sons of"
3071,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Heaven in crafts. But Zeus lay with the fair-cheeked daughter of Ocean
3072,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,and Tethys apart from Hera.... ((LACUNA)) ....deceiving Metis (Thought)
3073,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,although she was full wise. But he seized her with his hands and put
3074,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"her in his belly, for fear that she might bring forth something stronger"
3075,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"than his thunderbolt: therefore did Zeus, who sits on high and dwells"
3076,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"in the aether, swallow her down suddenly. But she straightway conceived"
3077,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,Pallas Athene: and the father of men and gods gave her birth by way
3078,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,of his head on the banks of the river Trito. And she remained hidden
3079,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"beneath the inward parts of Zeus, even Metis, Athena's mother, worker of"
3080,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"righteousness, who was wiser than gods and mortal men. There the goddess"
3081,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(Athena) received that [1631] whereby she excelled in strength all
3082,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"the deathless ones who dwell in Olympus, she who made the host-scaring"
3083,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"weapon of Athena. And with it (Zeus) gave her birth, arrayed in arms of"
3084,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,war.
3085,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
3086,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 930-933) And of Amphitrite and the loud-roaring Earth-Shaker was
3087,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"born great, wide-ruling Triton, and he owns the depths of the sea,"
3088,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,living with his dear mother and the lord his father in their golden
3089,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"house, an awful god."
3090,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
3091,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,(ll. 933-937) Also Cytherea bare to Ares the shield-piercer Panic and
3092,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Fear, terrible gods who drive in disorder the close ranks of men in"
3093,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"numbing war, with the help of Ares, sacker of towns: and Harmonia whom"
3094,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,high-spirited Cadmus made his wife.
3095,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,
3096,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"(ll. 938-939) And Maia, the daughter of Atlas, bare to Zeus glorious"
3097,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,"Hermes, the herald of the deathless gods, for she went up into his holy"
3098,THE WORKS OF HESIOD,bed.

4176,((LACUNA)),
4177,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 1-27) Or like her who left home and country and came to Thebes,"
4178,((LACUNA)),"following warlike Amphitryon,--even Alcmena, the daughter of Electyron,"
4179,((LACUNA)),gatherer of the people. She surpassed the tribe of womankind in beauty
4180,((LACUNA)),and in height; and in wisdom none vied with her of those whom mortal
4181,((LACUNA)),women bare of union with mortal men. Her face and her dark eyes wafted
4182,((LACUNA)),such charm as comes from golden Aphrodite. And she so honoured her
4183,((LACUNA)),husband in her heart as none of womankind did before her. Verily he had
4184,((LACUNA)),slain her noble father violently when he was angry about oxen; so
4185,((LACUNA)),he left his own country and came to Thebes and was suppliant to the
4186,((LACUNA)),shield-carrying men of Cadmus. There he dwelt with his modest wife
4187,((LACUNA)),"without the joys of love, nor might he go in unto the neat-ankled"
4188,((LACUNA)),daughter of Electyron until he had avenged the death of his wife's
4189,((LACUNA)),great-hearted brothers and utterly burned with blazing fire the villages
4190,((LACUNA)),"of the heroes, the Taphians and Teleboans; for this thing was laid upon"
4191,((LACUNA)),"him, and the gods were witnesses to it. And he feared their anger, and"
4192,((LACUNA)),hastened to perform the great task to which Zeus had bound him. With him
4193,((LACUNA)),"went the horse-driving Boeotians, breathing above their shields, and the"
4194,((LACUNA)),"Locrians who fight hand to hand, and the gallant Phocians eager for"
4195,((LACUNA)),"war and battle. And the noble son of Alcaeus led them, rejoicing in his"
4196,((LACUNA)),host.
4197,((LACUNA)),
4198,((LACUNA)),(ll. 27-55) But the father of men and gods was forming another scheme in
4199,((LACUNA)),"his heart, to beget one to defend against destruction gods and men who"
4200,((LACUNA)),eat bread. So he arose from Olympus by night pondering guile in the deep
4201,((LACUNA)),"of his heart, and yearned for the love of the well-girded woman. Quickly"
4202,((LACUNA)),"he came to Typhaonium, and from there again wise Zeus went on and trod"
4203,((LACUNA)),the highest peak of Phicium [1801]: there he sat and planned marvellous
4204,((LACUNA)),things in his heart. So in one night Zeus shared the bed and love of the
4205,((LACUNA)),neat-ankled daughter of Electyron and fulfilled his desire; and in the
4206,((LACUNA)),"same night Amphitryon, gatherer of the people, the glorious hero, came"
4207,((LACUNA)),to his house when he had ended his great task. He hastened not to go to
4208,((LACUNA)),"his bondmen and shepherds afield, but first went in unto his wife: such"
4209,((LACUNA)),desire took hold on the shepherd of the people. And as a man who has
4210,((LACUNA)),"escaped joyfully from misery, whether of sore disease or cruel bondage,"
4211,((LACUNA)),"so then did Amphitryon, when he had wound up all his heavy task, come"
4212,((LACUNA)),glad and welcome to his home. And all night long he lay with his modest
4213,((LACUNA)),"wife, delighting in the gifts of golden Aphrodite. And she, being"
4214,((LACUNA)),"subject in love to a god and to a man exceeding goodly, brought forth"
4215,((LACUNA)),"twin sons in seven-gated Thebe. Though they were brothers, these were"
4216,((LACUNA)),"not of one spirit; for one was weaker but the other a far better man,"
4217,((LACUNA)),"one terrible and strong, the mighty Heracles. Him she bare through"
4218,((LACUNA)),"the embrace of the son of Cronos lord of dark clouds and the other,"
4219,((LACUNA)),"Iphiclus, of Amphitryon the spear-wielder--offspring distinct, this one"
4220,((LACUNA)),"of union with a mortal man, but that other of union with Zeus, leader of"
4221,((LACUNA)),all the gods.
4222,((LACUNA)),
4223,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 57-77) And he slew Cycnus, the gallant son of Ares. For he found"
4224,((LACUNA)),"him in the close of far-shooting Apollo, him and his father Ares, never"
4225,((LACUNA)),sated with war. Their armour shone like a flame of blazing fire as they
4226,((LACUNA)),two stood in their car: their swift horses struck the earth and pawed
4227,((LACUNA)),"it with their hoofs, and the dust rose like smoke about them, pounded"
4228,((LACUNA)),"by the chariot wheels and the horses' hoofs, while the well-made chariot"
4229,((LACUNA)),and its rails rattled around them as the horses plunged. And blameless
4230,((LACUNA)),"Cycnus was glad, for he looked to slay the warlike son of Zeus and his"
4231,((LACUNA)),"charioteer with the sword, and to strip off their splendid armour."
4232,((LACUNA)),"But Phoebus Apollo would not listen to his vaunts, for he himself had"
4233,((LACUNA)),stirred up mighty Heracles against him. And all the grove and altar
4234,((LACUNA)),of Pagasaean Apollo flamed because of the dread god and because of his
4235,((LACUNA)),arms; for his eyes flashed as with fire. What mortal men would have
4236,((LACUNA)),dared to meet him face to face save Heracles and glorious Iolaus? For
4237,((LACUNA)),great was their strength and unconquerable were the arms which grew
4238,((LACUNA)),from their shoulders on their strong limbs. Then Heracles spake to his
4239,((LACUNA)),charioteer strong Iolaus:
4240,((LACUNA)),
4241,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 78-94) 'O hero Iolaus, best beloved of all men, truly Amphitryon"
4242,((LACUNA)),sinned deeply against the blessed gods who dwell on Olympus when he came
4243,((LACUNA)),"to sweet-crowned Thebe and left Tiryns, the well-built citadel, because"
4244,((LACUNA)),he slew Electryon for the sake of his wide-browned oxen. Then he came to
4245,((LACUNA)),"Creon and long-robed Eniocha, who received him kindly and gave him"
4246,((LACUNA)),"all fitting things, as is due to suppliants, and honoured him in their"
4247,((LACUNA)),hearts even more. And he lived joyfully with his wife the neat-ankled
4248,((LACUNA)),"daughter of Electyron: and presently, while the years rolled on, we were"
4249,((LACUNA)),"born, unlike in body as in mind, even your father and I. From him Zeus"
4250,((LACUNA)),"took away sense, so that he left his home and his parents and went to"
4251,((LACUNA)),do honour to the wicked Eurystheus--unhappy man! Deeply indeed did he
4252,((LACUNA)),grieve afterwards in bearing the burden of his own mad folly; but that
4253,((LACUNA)),cannot be taken back. But on me fate laid heavy tasks.
4254,((LACUNA)),
4255,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 95-101) 'Yet, come, friend, quickly take the red-dyed reins of the"
4256,((LACUNA)),swift horses and raise high courage in your heart and guide the swift
4257,((LACUNA)),chariot and strong fleet-footed horses straight on. Have no secret fear
4258,((LACUNA)),at the noise of man-slaying Ares who now rages shouting about the holy
4259,((LACUNA)),"grove of Phoebus Apollo, the lord who shoots form afar. Surely, strong"
4260,((LACUNA)),"though he be, he shall have enough of war.'"
4261,((LACUNA)),
4262,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 102-114) And blameless Iolaus answered him again: 'Good friend,"
4263,((LACUNA)),truly the father of men and gods greatly honours your head and the
4264,((LACUNA)),"bull-like Earth-Shaker also, who keeps Thebe's veil of walls and guards"
4265,((LACUNA)),"the city,--so great and strong is this fellow they bring into your hands"
4266,((LACUNA)),"that you may win great glory. But come, put on your arms of war that"
4267,((LACUNA)),with all speed we may bring the car of Ares and our own together and
4268,((LACUNA)),"fight; for he shall not frighten the dauntless son of Zeus, nor yet the"
4269,((LACUNA)),"son of Iphiclus: rather, I think he will flee before the two sons of"
4270,((LACUNA)),blameless Alcides who are near him and eager to raise the war cry for
4271,((LACUNA)),battle; for this they love better than a feast.'
4272,((LACUNA)),
4273,((LACUNA)),(ll. 115-117) So he said. And mighty Heracles was glad in heart and
4274,((LACUNA)),"smiled, for the other's words pleased him well, and he answered him with"
4275,((LACUNA)),winged words:
4276,((LACUNA)),
4277,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 118-121) 'O hero Iolaus, heaven-sprung, now is rough battle hard"
4278,((LACUNA)),"at hand. But, as you have shown your skill at other-times, so now also"
4279,((LACUNA)),"wheel the great black-maned horse Arion about every way, and help me as"
4280,((LACUNA)),you may be able.'
4281,((LACUNA)),
4282,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 122-138) So he said, and put upon his legs greaves of shining"
4283,((LACUNA)),"bronze, the splendid gift of Hephaestus. Next he fastened about his"
4284,((LACUNA)),"breast a fine golden breast-plate, curiously wrought, which Pallas"
4285,((LACUNA)),Athene the daughter of Zeus had given him when first he was about to set
4286,((LACUNA)),out upon his grievous labours. Over his shoulders the fierce warrior
4287,((LACUNA)),"put the steel that saves men from doom, and across his breast he slung"
4288,((LACUNA)),"behind him a hollow quiver. Within it were many chilling arrows, dealers"
4289,((LACUNA)),"of death which makes speech forgotten: in front they had death, and"
4290,((LACUNA)),trickled with tears; their shafts were smooth and very long; and their
4291,((LACUNA)),butts were covered with feathers of a brown eagle. And he took his
4292,((LACUNA)),"strong spear, pointed with shining bronze, and on his valiant head set"
4293,((LACUNA)),"a well-made helm of adamant, cunningly wrought, which fitted closely on"
4294,((LACUNA)),the temples; and that guarded the head of god-like Heracles.
4295,((LACUNA)),
4296,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 139-153) In his hands he took his shield, all glittering: no one"
4297,((LACUNA)),ever broke it with a blow or crushed it. And a wonder it was to see; for
4298,((LACUNA)),"its whole orb was a-shimmer with enamel and white ivory and electrum,"
4299,((LACUNA)),and it glowed with shining gold; and there were zones of cyanus [1802]
4300,((LACUNA)),"drawn upon it. In the centre was Fear worked in adamant, unspeakable,"
4301,((LACUNA)),staring backwards with eyes that glowed with fire. His mouth was full
4302,((LACUNA)),"of teeth in a white row, fearful and daunting, and upon his grim brow"
4303,((LACUNA)),"hovered frightful Strife who arrays the throng of men: pitiless she, for"
4304,((LACUNA)),she took away the mind and senses of poor wretches who made war against
4305,((LACUNA)),the son of Zeus. Their souls passed beneath the earth and went down into
4306,((LACUNA)),"the house of Hades; but their bones, when the skin is rotted about them,"
4307,((LACUNA)),crumble away on the dark earth under parching Sirius.
4308,((LACUNA)),
4309,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 154-160) Upon the shield Pursuit and Flight were wrought, and"
4310,((LACUNA)),"Tumult, and Panic, and Slaughter. Strife also, and Uproar were hurrying"
4311,((LACUNA)),"about, and deadly Fate was there holding one man newly wounded, and"
4312,((LACUNA)),"another unwounded; and one, who was dead, she was dragging by the feet"
4313,((LACUNA)),through the tumult. She had on her shoulders a garment red with the
4314,((LACUNA)),"blood of men, and terribly she glared and gnashed her teeth."
4315,((LACUNA)),
4316,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 160-167) And there were heads of snakes unspeakably frightful,"
4317,((LACUNA)),twelve of them; and they used to frighten the tribes of men on earth
4318,((LACUNA)),whosoever made war against the son of Zeus; for they would clash their
4319,((LACUNA)),teeth when Amphitryon's son was fighting: and brightly shone these
4320,((LACUNA)),wonderful works. And it was as though there were spots upon the
4321,((LACUNA)),frightful snakes: and their backs were dark blue and their jaws were
4322,((LACUNA)),black.
4323,((LACUNA)),
4324,((LACUNA)),(ll. 168-177) Also there were upon the shield droves of boars and lions
4325,((LACUNA)),"who glared at each other, being furious and eager: the rows of them"
4326,((LACUNA)),"moved on together, and neither side trembled but both bristled up their"
4327,((LACUNA)),"manes. For already a great lion lay between them and two boars, one on"
4328,((LACUNA)),"either side, bereft of life, and their dark blood was dripping down"
4329,((LACUNA)),upon the ground; they lay dead with necks outstretched beneath the grim
4330,((LACUNA)),lions. And both sides were roused still more to fight because they were
4331,((LACUNA)),"angry, the fierce boars and the bright-eyed lions."
4332,((LACUNA)),
4333,((LACUNA)),(ll. 178-190) And there was the strife of the Lapith spearmen gathered
4334,((LACUNA)),"round the prince Caeneus and Dryas and Peirithous, with Hopleus,"
4335,((LACUNA)),"Exadius, Phalereus, and Prolochus, Mopsus the son of Ampyce of"
4336,((LACUNA)),"Titaresia, a scion of Ares, and Theseus, the son of Aegeus, like unto"
4337,((LACUNA)),"the deathless gods. These were of silver, and had armour of gold upon"
4338,((LACUNA)),their bodies. And the Centaurs were gathered against them on the other
4339,((LACUNA)),"side with Petraeus and Asbolus the diviner, Arctus, and Ureus, and"
4340,((LACUNA)),"black-haired Mimas, and the two sons of silver, and they had pinetrees"
4341,((LACUNA)),"of gold in their hands, and they were rushing together as though they"
4342,((LACUNA)),were alive and striking at one another hand to hand with spears and with
4343,((LACUNA)),pines.
4344,((LACUNA)),
4345,((LACUNA)),(ll. 191-196) And on the shield stood the fleet-footed horses of grim
4346,((LACUNA)),"Ares made gold, and deadly Ares the spoil-winner himself. He held a"
4347,((LACUNA)),spear in his hands and was urging on the footmen: he was red with blood
4348,((LACUNA)),"as if he were slaying living men, and he stood in his chariot. Beside"
4349,((LACUNA)),"him stood Fear and Flight, eager to plunge amidst the fighting men."
4350,((LACUNA)),
4351,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 197-200) There, too, was the daughter of Zeus, Tritogeneia who"
4352,((LACUNA)),"drives the spoil [1803]. She was like as if she would array a battle,"
4353,((LACUNA)),"with a spear in her hand, and a golden helmet, and the aegis about her"
4354,((LACUNA)),shoulders. And she was going towards the awful strife.
4355,((LACUNA)),
4356,((LACUNA)),(ll. 201-206) And there was the holy company of the deathless gods: and
4357,((LACUNA)),in the midst the son of Zeus and Leto played sweetly on a golden lyre.
4358,((LACUNA)),"There also was the abode of the gods, pure Olympus, and their assembly,"
4359,((LACUNA)),"and infinite riches were spread around in the gathering, the Muses of"
4360,((LACUNA)),Pieria were beginning a song like clear-voiced singers.
4361,((LACUNA)),
4362,((LACUNA)),(ll. 207-215) And on the shield was a harbour with a safe haven from the
4363,((LACUNA)),"irresistible sea, made of refined tin wrought in a circle, and it seemed"
4364,((LACUNA)),to heave with waves. In the middle of it were many dolphins rushing this
4365,((LACUNA)),"way and that, fishing: and they seemed to be swimming. Two dolphins of"
4366,((LACUNA)),silver were spouting and devouring the mute fishes. And beneath them
4367,((LACUNA)),fishes of bronze were trembling. And on the shore sat a fisherman
4368,((LACUNA)),"watching: in his hands he held a casting net for fish, and seemed as if"
4369,((LACUNA)),about to cast it forth.
4370,((LACUNA)),
4371,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 216-237) There, too, was the son of rich-haired Danae, the horseman"
4372,((LACUNA)),Perseus: his feet did not touch the shield and yet were not far from
4373,((LACUNA)),"it--very marvellous to remark, since he was not supported anywhere; for"
4374,((LACUNA)),so did the famous Lame One fashion him of gold with his hands. On his
4375,((LACUNA)),"feet he had winged sandals, and his black-sheathed sword was slung"
4376,((LACUNA)),across his shoulders by a cross-belt of bronze. He was flying swift as
4377,((LACUNA)),"thought. The head of a dreadful monster, the Gorgon, covered the broad"
4378,((LACUNA)),"of his back, and a bag of silver--a marvel to see--contained it: and"
4379,((LACUNA)),from the bag bright tassels of gold hung down. Upon the head of the hero
4380,((LACUNA)),lay the dread cap [1804] of Hades which had the awful gloom of night.
4381,((LACUNA)),"Perseus himself, the son of Danae, was at full stretch, like one who"
4382,((LACUNA)),"hurries and shudders with horror. And after him rushed the Gorgons,"
4383,((LACUNA)),"unapproachable and unspeakable, longing to seize him: as they trod upon"
4384,((LACUNA)),"the pale adamant, the shield rang sharp and clear with a loud clanging."
4385,((LACUNA)),Two serpents hung down at their girdles with heads curved forward: their
4386,((LACUNA)),"tongues were flickering, and their teeth gnashing with fury, and their"
4387,((LACUNA)),eyes glaring fiercely. And upon the awful heads of the Gorgons great
4388,((LACUNA)),Fear was quaking.
4389,((LACUNA)),
4390,((LACUNA)),(ll. 237-270) And beyond these there were men fighting in warlike
4391,((LACUNA)),"harness, some defending their own town and parents from destruction,"
4392,((LACUNA)),"and others eager to sack it; many lay dead, but the greater number still"
4393,((LACUNA)),strove and fought. The women on well-built towers of bronze were crying
4394,((LACUNA)),shrilly and tearing their cheeks like living beings--the work of famous
4395,((LACUNA)),Hephaestus. And the men who were elders and on whom age had laid hold
4396,((LACUNA)),"were all together outside the gates, and were holding up their hands"
4397,((LACUNA)),"to the blessed gods, fearing for their own sons. But these again were"
4398,((LACUNA)),"engaged in battle: and behind them the dusky Fates, gnashing their white"
4399,((LACUNA)),"fangs, lowering, grim, bloody, and unapproachable, struggled for those"
4400,((LACUNA)),"who were falling, for they all were longing to drink dark blood. So soon"
4401,((LACUNA)),"as they caught a man overthrown or falling newly wounded, one of them"
4402,((LACUNA)),"would clasp her great claws about him, and his soul would go down to"
4403,((LACUNA)),Hades to chilly Tartarus. And when they had satisfied their souls with
4404,((LACUNA)),"human blood, they would cast that one behind them, and rush back again"
4405,((LACUNA)),into the tumult and the fray. Clotho and Lachesis were over them and
4406,((LACUNA)),"Atropos less tall than they, a goddess of no great frame, yet superior"
4407,((LACUNA)),to the others and the eldest of them. And they all made a fierce fight
4408,((LACUNA)),"over one poor wretch, glaring evilly at one another with furious eyes"
4409,((LACUNA)),and fighting equally with claws and hands. By them stood Darkness of
4410,((LACUNA)),"Death, mournful and fearful, pale, shrivelled, shrunk with hunger,"
4411,((LACUNA)),"swollen-kneed. Long nails tipped her hands, and she dribbled at the"
4412,((LACUNA)),"nose, and from her cheeks blood dripped down to the ground. She"
4413,((LACUNA)),"stood leering hideously, and much dust sodden with tears lay upon her"
4414,((LACUNA)),shoulders.
4415,((LACUNA)),
4416,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 270-285) Next, there was a city of men with goodly towers; and"
4417,((LACUNA)),"seven gates of gold, fitted to the lintels, guarded it. The men were"
4418,((LACUNA)),making merry with festivities and dances; some were bringing home
4419,((LACUNA)),"a bride to her husband on a well-wheeled car, while the bridal-song"
4420,((LACUNA)),"swelled high, and the glow of blazing torches held by handmaidens"
4421,((LACUNA)),"rolled in waves afar. And these maidens went before, delighting in the"
4422,((LACUNA)),"festival; and after them came frolicsome choirs, the youths singing"
4423,((LACUNA)),"soft-mouthed to the sound of shrill pipes, while the echo was shivered"
4424,((LACUNA)),"around them, and the girls led on the lovely dance to the sound of"
4425,((LACUNA)),"lyres. Then again on the other side was a rout of young men revelling,"
4426,((LACUNA)),"with flutes playing; some frolicking with dance and song, and others"
4427,((LACUNA)),were going forward in time with a flute player and laughing. The whole
4428,((LACUNA)),town was filled with mirth and dance and festivity.
4429,((LACUNA)),
4430,((LACUNA)),(ll. 285-304) Others again were mounted on horseback and galloping
4431,((LACUNA)),"before the town. And there were ploughmen breaking up the good soil,"
4432,((LACUNA)),clothed in tunics girt up. Also there was a wide cornland and some men
4433,((LACUNA)),were reaping with sharp hooks the stalks which bended with the weight of
4434,((LACUNA)),the cars--as if they were reaping Demeter's grain: others were binding
4435,((LACUNA)),the sheaves with bands and were spreading the threshing floor. And some
4436,((LACUNA)),"held reaping hooks and were gathering the vintage, while others were"
4437,((LACUNA)),taking from the reapers into baskets white and black clusters from the
4438,((LACUNA)),long rows of vines which were heavy with leaves and tendrils of silver.
4439,((LACUNA)),Others again were gathering them into baskets. Beside them was a row of
4440,((LACUNA)),"vines in gold, the splendid work of cunning Hephaestus: it had shivering"
4441,((LACUNA)),leaves and stakes of silver and was laden with grapes which turned black
4442,((LACUNA)),[1805]. And there were men treading out the grapes and others drawing
4443,((LACUNA)),"off liquor. Also there were men boxing and wrestling, and huntsmen"
4444,((LACUNA)),"chasing swift hares with a leash of sharp-toothed dogs before them, they"
4445,((LACUNA)),"eager to catch the hares, and the hares eager to escape."
4446,((LACUNA)),
4447,((LACUNA)),"(ll 305-313) Next to them were horsemen hard set, and they contended and"
4448,((LACUNA)),"laboured for a prize. The charioteers standing on their well-woven cars,"
4449,((LACUNA)),urged on their swift horses with loose rein; the jointed cars flew along
4450,((LACUNA)),clattering and the naves of the wheels shrieked loudly. So they were
4451,((LACUNA)),"engaged in an unending toil, and the end with victory came never to"
4452,((LACUNA)),"them, and the contest was ever unwon. And there was set out for them"
4453,((LACUNA)),"within the course a great tripod of gold, the splendid work of cunning"
4454,((LACUNA)),Hephaestus.
4455,((LACUNA)),
4456,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 314-317) And round the rim Ocean was flowing, with a full stream"
4457,((LACUNA)),"as it seemed, and enclosed all the cunning work of the shield. Over it"
4458,((LACUNA)),"swans were soaring and calling loudly, and many others were swimming"
4459,((LACUNA)),upon the surface of the water; and near them were shoals of fish.
4460,((LACUNA)),
4461,((LACUNA)),(ll. 318-326) A wonderful thing the great strong shield was to see--even
4462,((LACUNA)),"for Zeus the loud-thunderer, by whose will Hephaestus made it and fitted"
4463,((LACUNA)),"it with his hands. This shield the valiant son of Zeus wielded masterly,"
4464,((LACUNA)),and leaped upon his horse-chariot like the lightning of his father Zeus
4465,((LACUNA)),"who holds the aegis, moving lithely. And his charioteer, strong Iolaus,"
4466,((LACUNA)),"standing upon the car, guided the curved chariot."
4467,((LACUNA)),
4468,((LACUNA)),(ll. 327-337) Then the goddess grey-eyed Athene came near them and spoke
4469,((LACUNA)),"winged words, encouraging them: 'Hail, offspring of far-famed Lynceus!"
4470,((LACUNA)),Even now Zeus who reigns over the blessed gods gives you power to
4471,((LACUNA)),slay Cycnus and to strip off his splendid armour. Yet I will tell you
4472,((LACUNA)),"something besides, mightiest of the people. When you have robbed"
4473,((LACUNA)),"Cycnus of sweet life, then leave him there and his armour also, and you"
4474,((LACUNA)),"yourself watch man-slaying Ares narrowly as he attacks, and wherever you"
4475,((LACUNA)),"shall see him uncovered below his cunningly-wrought shield, there wound"
4476,((LACUNA)),him with your sharp spear. Then draw back; for it is not ordained that
4477,((LACUNA)),you should take his horses or his splendid armour.'
4478,((LACUNA)),
4479,((LACUNA)),(ll. 338-349) So said the bright-eyed goddess and swiftly got up into
4480,((LACUNA)),the car with victory and renown in her hands. Then heaven-nurtured
4481,((LACUNA)),"Iolaus called terribly to the horses, and at his cry they swiftly"
4482,((LACUNA)),"whirled the fleet chariot along, raising dust from the plain; for the"
4483,((LACUNA)),goddess bright-eyed Athene put mettle into them by shaking her aegis.
4484,((LACUNA)),And the earth groaned all round them.
4485,((LACUNA)),
4486,((LACUNA)),"And they, horse-taming Cycnus and Ares, insatiable in war, came on"
4487,((LACUNA)),"together like fire or whirlwind. Then their horses neighed shrilly, face"
4488,((LACUNA)),to face; and the echo was shivered all round them. And mighty Heracles
4489,((LACUNA)),spoke first and said to that other:
4490,((LACUNA)),
4491,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 350-367) 'Cycnus, good sir! Why, pray, do you set your swift horses"
4492,((LACUNA)),"at us, men who are tried in labour and pain? Nay, guide your fleet car"
4493,((LACUNA)),aside and yield and go out of the path. It is to Trachis I am driving
4494,((LACUNA)),"on, to Ceyx the king, who is the first in Trachis for power and for"
4495,((LACUNA)),"honour, and that you yourself know well, for you have his daughter"
4496,((LACUNA)),dark-eyed Themistinoe to wife. Fool! For Ares shall not deliver you from
4497,((LACUNA)),"the end of death, if we two meet together in battle. Another time ere"
4498,((LACUNA)),"this I declare he has made trial of my spear, when he defended sandy"
4499,((LACUNA)),"Pylos and stood against me, fiercely longing for fight. Thrice was he"
4500,((LACUNA)),"stricken by my spear and dashed to earth, and his shield was pierced;"
4501,((LACUNA)),"but the fourth time I struck his thigh, laying on with all my strength,"
4502,((LACUNA)),and tare deep into his flesh. And he fell headlong in the dust upon the
4503,((LACUNA)),ground through the force of my spear-thrust; then truly he would have
4504,((LACUNA)),"been disgraced among the deathless gods, if by my hands he had left"
4505,((LACUNA)),behind his bloody spoils.'
4506,((LACUNA)),
4507,((LACUNA)),(ll. 368-385) So said he. But Cycnus the stout spearman cared not to
4508,((LACUNA)),obey him and to pull up the horses that drew his chariot. Then it was
4509,((LACUNA)),"that from their well-woven cars they both leaped straight to the ground,"
4510,((LACUNA)),the son of Zeus and the son of the Lord of War. The charioteers drove
4511,((LACUNA)),"near by their horses with beautiful manes, and the wide earth rang with"
4512,((LACUNA)),the beat of their hoofs as they rushed along. As when rocks leap forth
4513,((LACUNA)),"from the high peak of a great mountain, and fall on one another, and"
4514,((LACUNA)),many towering oaks and pines and long-rooted poplars are broken by them
4515,((LACUNA)),as they whirl swiftly down until they reach the plain; so did they fall
4516,((LACUNA)),"on one another with a great shout: and all the town of the Myrmidons,"
4517,((LACUNA)),"and famous Iolcus, and Arne, and Helice, and grassy Anthea echoed loudly"
4518,((LACUNA)),at the voice of the two. With an awful cry they closed: and wise Zeus
4519,((LACUNA)),"thundered loudly and rained down drops of blood, giving the signal for"
4520,((LACUNA)),battle to his dauntless son.
4521,((LACUNA)),
4522,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 386-401) As a tusked boar, that is fearful for a man to see before"
4523,((LACUNA)),"him in the glens of a mountain, resolves to fight with the huntsmen and"
4524,((LACUNA)),"white tusks, turning sideways, while foam flows all round his mouth as"
4525,((LACUNA)),"he gnashes, and his eyes are like glowing fire, and he bristles the hair"
4526,((LACUNA)),on his mane and around his neck--like him the son of Zeus leaped from
4527,((LACUNA)),"his horse-chariot. And when the dark-winged whirring grasshopper,"
4528,((LACUNA)),"perched on a green shoot, begins to sing of summer to men--his food"
4529,((LACUNA)),and drink is the dainty dew--and all day long from dawn pours forth his
4530,((LACUNA)),"voice in the deadliest heat, when Sirius scorches the flesh (then the"
4531,((LACUNA)),"beard grows upon the millet which men sow in summer), when the crude"
4532,((LACUNA)),grapes which Dionysus gave to men--a joy and a sorrow both--begin to
4533,((LACUNA)),"colour, in that season they fought and loud rose the clamour."
4534,((LACUNA)),
4535,((LACUNA)),(ll. 402-412) As two lions [1806] on either side of a slain deer spring
4536,((LACUNA)),"at one another in fury, and there is a fearful snarling and a clashing"
4537,((LACUNA)),also of teeth--like vultures with crooked talons and hooked beak that
4538,((LACUNA)),fight and scream aloud on a high rock over a mountain goat or fat
4539,((LACUNA)),"wild-deer which some active man has shot with an arrow from the string,"
4540,((LACUNA)),"and himself has wandered away elsewhere, not knowing the place; but they"
4541,((LACUNA)),quickly mark it and vehemently do keen battle about it--like these they
4542,((LACUNA)),two rushed upon one another with a shout.
4543,((LACUNA)),
4544,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 413-423) Then Cycnus, eager to kill the son of almighty Zeus,"
4545,((LACUNA)),"struck upon his shield with a brazen spear, but did not break"
4546,((LACUNA)),the bronze; and the gift of the god saved his foe. But the son of
4547,((LACUNA)),"Amphitryon, mighty Heracles, with his long spear struck Cycnus violently"
4548,((LACUNA)),"in the neck beneath the chin, where it was unguarded between helm and"
4549,((LACUNA)),shield. And the deadly spear cut through the two sinews; for the hero's
4550,((LACUNA)),full strength lighted on his foe. And Cycnus fell as an oak falls or a
4551,((LACUNA)),lofty pine that is stricken by the lurid thunderbolt of Zeus; even so he
4552,((LACUNA)),"fell, and his armour adorned with bronze clashed about him."
4553,((LACUNA)),
4554,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 424-442) Then the stout hearted son of Zeus let him be, and himself"
4555,((LACUNA)),"watched for the onset of manslaying Ares: fiercely he stared, like a"
4556,((LACUNA)),lion who has come upon a body and full eagerly rips the hide with his
4557,((LACUNA)),strong claws and takes away the sweet life with all speed: his dark
4558,((LACUNA)),"heart is filled with rage and his eyes glare fiercely, while he tears"
4559,((LACUNA)),up the earth with his paws and lashes his flanks and shoulders with his
4560,((LACUNA)),tail so that no one dares to face him and go near to give battle. Even
4561,((LACUNA)),"so, the son of Amphitryon, unsated of battle, stood eagerly face to face"
4562,((LACUNA)),"with Ares, nursing courage in his heart. And Ares drew near him with"
4563,((LACUNA)),grief in his heart; and they both sprang at one another with a cry. As
4564,((LACUNA)),it is when a rock shoots out from a great cliff and whirls down with
4565,((LACUNA)),"long bounds, careering eagerly with a roar, and a high crag clashes with"
4566,((LACUNA)),it and keeps it there where they strike together; with no less clamour
4567,((LACUNA)),"did deadly Ares, the chariot-borne, rush shouting at Heracles. And he"
4568,((LACUNA)),quickly received the attack.
4569,((LACUNA)),
4570,((LACUNA)),(ll. 443-449) But Athene the daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus came to meet
4571,((LACUNA)),"Ares, wearing the dark aegis, and she looked at him with an angry"
4572,((LACUNA)),"frown and spoke winged words to him. 'Ares, check your fierce anger and"
4573,((LACUNA)),"matchless hands; for it is not ordained that you should kill Heracles,"
4574,((LACUNA)),"the bold-hearted son of Zeus, and strip off his rich armour. Come, then,"
4575,((LACUNA)),cease fighting and do not withstand me.'
4576,((LACUNA)),
4577,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 450-466) So said she, but did not move the courageous spirit of"
4578,((LACUNA)),"Ares. But he uttered a great shout and waving his spears like fire, he"
4579,((LACUNA)),"rushed headlong at strong Heracles, longing to kill him, and hurled a"
4580,((LACUNA)),"brazen spear upon the great shield, for he was furiously angry because"
4581,((LACUNA)),of his dead son; but bright-eyed Athene reached out from the car and
4582,((LACUNA)),turned aside the force of the spear.
4583,((LACUNA)),
4584,((LACUNA)),Then bitter grief seized Ares and he drew his keen sword and leaped upon
4585,((LACUNA)),"bold-hearted Heracles. But as he came on, the son of Amphitryon, unsated"
4586,((LACUNA)),"of fierce battle, shrewdly wounded his thigh where it was exposed"
4587,((LACUNA)),"under his richly-wrought shield, and tare deep into his flesh with the"
4588,((LACUNA)),spear-thrust and cast him flat upon the ground. And Panic and Dread
4589,((LACUNA)),quickly drove his smooth-wheeled chariot and horses near him and lifted
4590,((LACUNA)),"him from the wide-pathed earth into his richly-wrought car, and then"
4591,((LACUNA)),straight lashed the horses and came to high Olympus.
4592,((LACUNA)),
4593,((LACUNA)),(ll. 467-471) But the son of Alcmena and glorious Iolaus stripped the
4594,((LACUNA)),"fine armour off Cycnus' shoulders and went, and their swift horses"
4595,((LACUNA)),carried them straight to the city of Trachis. And bright-eyed Athene
4596,((LACUNA)),went thence to great Olympus and her father's house.
4597,((LACUNA)),
4598,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 472-480) As for Cycnus, Ceyx buried him and the countless people"
4599,((LACUNA)),"who lived near the city of the glorious king, in Anthe and the city of"
4600,((LACUNA)),"the Myrmidons, and famous Iolcus, and Arne, and Helice: and much people"
4601,((LACUNA)),"were gathered doing honour to Ceyx, the friend of the blessed gods. But"
4602,((LACUNA)),"Anaurus, swelled by a rain-storm, blotted out the grave and memorial"
4603,((LACUNA)),"of Cycnus; for so Apollo, Leto's son, commanded him, because he used to"
4604,((LACUNA)),watch for and violently despoil the rich hecatombs that any might bring
4605,((LACUNA)),to Pytho.

5081,((LACUNA)),((LACUNA))
5082,((LACUNA)),
5083,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 1-9) For some say, at Dracanum; and some, on windy Icarus;"
5084,((LACUNA)),"and some, in Naxos, O Heaven-born, Insewn [2502]; and others by the"
5085,((LACUNA)),deep-eddying river Alpheus that pregnant Semele bare you to Zeus the
5086,((LACUNA)),"thunder-lover. And others yet, lord, say you were born in Thebes; but"
5087,((LACUNA)),all these lie. The Father of men and gods gave you birth remote from men
5088,((LACUNA)),"and secretly from white-armed Hera. There is a certain Nysa, a mountain"
5089,((LACUNA)),"most high and richly grown with woods, far off in Phoenice, near the"
5090,((LACUNA)),streams of Aegyptus.
5091,((LACUNA)),
5092,((LACUNA)),((LACUNA))
5093,((LACUNA)),
5094,((LACUNA)),(ll. 10-12) '...and men will lay up for her [2503] many offerings in
5095,((LACUNA)),"her shrines. And as these things are three [2504], so shall mortals ever"
5096,((LACUNA)),sacrifice perfect hecatombs to you at your feasts each three years.'
5097,((LACUNA)),
5098,((LACUNA)),(ll. 13-16) The Son of Cronos spoke and nodded with his dark brows. And
5099,((LACUNA)),"the divine locks of the king flowed forward from his immortal head, and"
5100,((LACUNA)),he made great Olympus reel. So spake wise Zeus and ordained it with a
5101,((LACUNA)),nod.
5102,((LACUNA)),
5103,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 17-21) Be favourable, O Insewn, Inspirer of frenzied women!"
5104,((LACUNA)),"we singers sing of you as we begin and as we end a strain, and none"
5105,((LACUNA)),"forgetting you may call holy song to mind. And so, farewell, Dionysus,"
5106,((LACUNA)),"Insewn, with your mother Semele whom men call Thyone."
5107,((LACUNA)),
5108,((LACUNA)),
5109,((LACUNA)),
5110,((LACUNA)),
5111,((LACUNA)),II. TO DEMETER (495 lines)
5112,((LACUNA)),
5113,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 1-3) I begin to sing of rich-haired Demeter, awful goddess--of her"
5114,((LACUNA)),"and her trim-ankled daughter whom Aidoneus rapt away, given to him by"
5115,((LACUNA)),all-seeing Zeus the loud-thunderer.
5116,((LACUNA)),
5117,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 4-18) Apart from Demeter, lady of the golden sword and glorious"
5118,((LACUNA)),"fruits, she was playing with the deep-bosomed daughters of Oceanus and"
5119,((LACUNA)),"gathering flowers over a soft meadow, roses and crocuses and beautiful"
5120,((LACUNA)),"violets, irises also and hyacinths and the narcissus, which Earth made"
5121,((LACUNA)),"to grow at the will of Zeus and to please the Host of Many, to be a"
5122,((LACUNA)),"snare for the bloom-like girl--a marvellous, radiant flower. It was a"
5123,((LACUNA)),thing of awe whether for deathless gods or mortal men to see: from its
5124,((LACUNA)),"root grew a hundred blooms, and it smelled most sweetly, so that all"
5125,((LACUNA)),wide heaven above and the whole earth and the sea's salt swell laughed
5126,((LACUNA)),for joy. And the girl was amazed and reached out with both hands to take
5127,((LACUNA)),the lovely toy; but the wide-pathed earth yawned there in the plain of
5128,((LACUNA)),"Nysa, and the lord, Host of Many, with his immortal horses sprang out"
5129,((LACUNA)),"upon her--the Son of Cronos, He who has many names [2505]."
5130,((LACUNA)),
5131,((LACUNA)),(ll. 19-32) He caught her up reluctant on his golden car and bare her
5132,((LACUNA)),"away lamenting. Then she cried out shrilly with her voice, calling upon"
5133,((LACUNA)),"her father, the Son of Cronos, who is most high and excellent. But no"
5134,((LACUNA)),"one, either of the deathless gods or of mortal men, heard her voice,"
5135,((LACUNA)),"nor yet the olive-trees bearing rich fruit: only tender-hearted Hecate,"
5136,((LACUNA)),"bright-coiffed, the daughter of Persaeus, heard the girl from her cave,"
5137,((LACUNA)),"and the lord Helios, Hyperion's bright son, as she cried to her father,"
5138,((LACUNA)),"the Son of Cronos. But he was sitting aloof, apart from the gods, in his"
5139,((LACUNA)),"temple where many pray, and receiving sweet offerings from mortal men."
5140,((LACUNA)),"So he, that Son of Cronos, of many names, who is Ruler of Many and"
5141,((LACUNA)),"Host of Many, was bearing her away by leave of Zeus on his immortal"
5142,((LACUNA)),chariot--his own brother's child and all unwilling.
5143,((LACUNA)),
5144,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 33-39) And so long as she, the goddess, yet beheld earth and starry"
5145,((LACUNA)),"heaven and the strong-flowing sea where fishes shoal, and the rays of"
5146,((LACUNA)),"the sun, and still hoped to see her dear mother and the tribes of"
5147,((LACUNA)),"the eternal gods, so long hope calmed her great heart for all her"
5148,((LACUNA)),trouble.... ((LACUNA)) ....and the heights of the mountains and the
5149,((LACUNA)),depths of the sea rang with her immortal voice: and her queenly mother
5150,((LACUNA)),heard her.
5151,((LACUNA)),
5152,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 40-53) Bitter pain seized her heart, and she rent the covering upon"
5153,((LACUNA)),her divine hair with her dear hands: her dark cloak she cast down from
5154,((LACUNA)),"both her shoulders and sped, like a wild-bird, over the firm land and"
5155,((LACUNA)),"yielding sea, seeking her child. But no one would tell her the truth,"
5156,((LACUNA)),neither god nor mortal men; and of the birds of omen none came with true
5157,((LACUNA)),news for her. Then for nine days queenly Deo wandered over the earth
5158,((LACUNA)),"with flaming torches in her hands, so grieved that she never tasted"
5159,((LACUNA)),"ambrosia and the sweet draught of nectar, nor sprinkled her body with"
5160,((LACUNA)),"water. But when the tenth enlightening dawn had come, Hecate, with a"
5161,((LACUNA)),"torch in her hands, met her, and spoke to her and told her news:"
5162,((LACUNA)),
5163,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 54-58) 'Queenly Demeter, bringer of seasons and giver of good"
5164,((LACUNA)),"gifts, what god of heaven or what mortal man has rapt away Persephone"
5165,((LACUNA)),"and pierced with sorrow your dear heart? For I heard her voice, yet"
5166,((LACUNA)),saw not with my eyes who it was. But I tell you truly and shortly all I
5167,((LACUNA)),know.'
5168,((LACUNA)),
5169,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 59-73) So, then, said Hecate. And the daughter of rich-haired Rhea"
5170,((LACUNA)),"answered her not, but sped swiftly with her, holding flaming torches in"
5171,((LACUNA)),"her hands. So they came to Helios, who is watchman of both gods and men,"
5172,((LACUNA)),and stood in front of his horses: and the bright goddess enquired of
5173,((LACUNA)),"him: 'Helios, do you at least regard me, goddess as I am, if ever by"
5174,((LACUNA)),word or deed of mine I have cheered your heart and spirit. Through the
5175,((LACUNA)),"fruitless air I heard the thrilling cry of my daughter whom I bare,"
5176,((LACUNA)),"sweet scion of my body and lovely in form, as of one seized violently;"
5177,((LACUNA)),though with my eyes I saw nothing. But you--for with your beams you look
5178,((LACUNA)),down from the bright upper air Over all the earth and sea--tell me truly
5179,((LACUNA)),"of my dear child, if you have seen her anywhere, what god or mortal man"
5180,((LACUNA)),"has violently seized her against her will and mine, and so made off.'"
5181,((LACUNA)),
5182,((LACUNA)),(ll. 74-87) So said she. And the Son of Hyperion answered her: 'Queen
5183,((LACUNA)),"Demeter, daughter of rich-haired Rhea, I will tell you the truth; for"
5184,((LACUNA)),I greatly reverence and pity you in your grief for your trim-ankled
5185,((LACUNA)),"daughter. None other of the deathless gods is to blame, but only"
5186,((LACUNA)),"cloud-gathering Zeus who gave her to Hades, her father's brother, to be"
5187,((LACUNA)),called his buxom wife. And Hades seized her and took her loudly crying
5188,((LACUNA)),"in his chariot down to his realm of mist and gloom. Yet, goddess, cease"
5189,((LACUNA)),"your loud lament and keep not vain anger unrelentingly: Aidoneus, the"
5190,((LACUNA)),"Ruler of Many, is no unfitting husband among the deathless gods for"
5191,((LACUNA)),"your child, being your own brother and born of the same stock: also, for"
5192,((LACUNA)),"honour, he has that third share which he received when division was made"
5193,((LACUNA)),"at the first, and is appointed lord of those among whom he dwells.'"
5194,((LACUNA)),
5195,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 88-89) So he spake, and called to his horses: and at his chiding"
5196,((LACUNA)),"they quickly whirled the swift chariot along, like long-winged birds."
5197,((LACUNA)),
5198,((LACUNA)),(ll. 90-112) But grief yet more terrible and savage came into the heart
5199,((LACUNA)),"of Demeter, and thereafter she was so angered with the dark-clouded Son"
5200,((LACUNA)),"of Cronos that she avoided the gathering of the gods and high Olympus,"
5201,((LACUNA)),"and went to the towns and rich fields of men, disfiguring her form a"
5202,((LACUNA)),long while. And no one of men or deep-bosomed women knew her when they
5203,((LACUNA)),"saw her, until she came to the house of wise Celeus who then was lord of"
5204,((LACUNA)),"fragrant Eleusis. Vexed in her dear heart, she sat near the wayside by"
5205,((LACUNA)),"the Maiden Well, from which the women of the place were used to draw"
5206,((LACUNA)),"water, in a shady place over which grew an olive shrub. And she was"
5207,((LACUNA)),like an ancient woman who is cut off from childbearing and the gifts of
5208,((LACUNA)),"garland-loving Aphrodite, like the nurses of king's children who deal"
5209,((LACUNA)),"justice, or like the house-keepers in their echoing halls. There the"
5210,((LACUNA)),"daughters of Celeus, son of Eleusis, saw her, as they were coming"
5211,((LACUNA)),"for easy-drawn water, to carry it in pitchers of bronze to their dear"
5212,((LACUNA)),father's house: four were they and like goddesses in the flower of their
5213,((LACUNA)),"girlhood, Callidice and Cleisidice and lovely Demo and Callithoe who was"
5214,((LACUNA)),"the eldest of them all. They knew her not,--for the gods are not easily"
5215,((LACUNA)),discerned by mortals--but standing near by her spoke winged words:
5216,((LACUNA)),
5217,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 113-117) 'Old mother, whence and who are you of folk born long ago?"
5218,((LACUNA)),Why are you gone away from the city and do not draw near the houses? For
5219,((LACUNA)),"there in the shady halls are women of just such age as you, and others"
5220,((LACUNA)),younger; and they would welcome you both by word and by deed.'
5221,((LACUNA)),
5222,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 118-144) Thus they said. And she, that queen among goddesses"
5223,((LACUNA)),"answered them saying: 'Hail, dear children, whosoever you are of"
5224,((LACUNA)),woman-kind. I will tell you my story; for it is not unseemly that I
5225,((LACUNA)),"should tell you truly what you ask. Doso is my name, for my stately"
5226,((LACUNA)),mother gave it me. And now I am come from Crete over the sea's wide
5227,((LACUNA)),"back,--not willingly; but pirates brought me thence by force of strength"
5228,((LACUNA)),against my liking. Afterwards they put in with their swift craft to
5229,((LACUNA)),"Thoricus, and there the women landed on the shore in full throng and the"
5230,((LACUNA)),"men likewise, and they began to make ready a meal by the stern-cables"
5231,((LACUNA)),"of the ship. But my heart craved not pleasant food, and I fled secretly"
5232,((LACUNA)),"across the dark country and escaped my masters, that they should not"
5233,((LACUNA)),"take me unpurchased across the sea, there to win a price for me. And so"
5234,((LACUNA)),I wandered and am come here: and I know not at all what land this is or
5235,((LACUNA)),what people are in it. But may all those who dwell on Olympus give you
5236,((LACUNA)),"husbands and birth of children as parents desire, so you take pity on"
5237,((LACUNA)),"me, maidens, and show me this clearly that I may learn, dear children,"
5238,((LACUNA)),"to the house of what man and woman I may go, to work for them cheerfully"
5239,((LACUNA)),at such tasks as belong to a woman of my age. Well could I nurse a new
5240,((LACUNA)),"born child, holding him in my arms, or keep house, or spread my masters'"
5241,((LACUNA)),"bed in a recess of the well-built chamber, or teach the women their"
5242,((LACUNA)),work.'
5243,((LACUNA)),
5244,((LACUNA)),(ll. 145-146) So said the goddess. And straightway the unwed maiden
5245,((LACUNA)),"Callidice, goodliest in form of the daughters of Celeus, answered her"
5246,((LACUNA)),and said:
5247,((LACUNA)),
5248,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 147-168) 'Mother, what the gods send us, we mortals bear perforce,"
5249,((LACUNA)),although we suffer; for they are much stronger than we. But now I will
5250,((LACUNA)),"teach you clearly, telling you the names of men who have great power and"
5251,((LACUNA)),"honour here and are chief among the people, guarding our city's coif of"
5252,((LACUNA)),towers by their wisdom and true judgements: there is wise Triptolemus
5253,((LACUNA)),and Dioclus and Polyxeinus and blameless Eumolpus and Dolichus and our
5254,((LACUNA)),"own brave father. All these have wives who manage in the house, and no"
5255,((LACUNA)),"one of them, so soon as she has seen you, would dishonour you and"
5256,((LACUNA)),"turn you from the house, but they will welcome you; for indeed you are"
5257,((LACUNA)),"godlike. But if you will, stay here; and we will go to our father's"
5258,((LACUNA)),"house and tell Metaneira, our deep-bosomed mother, all this matter"
5259,((LACUNA)),"fully, that she may bid you rather come to our home than search after"
5260,((LACUNA)),"the houses of others. She has an only son, late-born, who is being"
5261,((LACUNA)),"nursed in our well-built house, a child of many prayers and welcome: if"
5262,((LACUNA)),"you could bring him up until he reached the full measure of youth, any"
5263,((LACUNA)),"one of womankind who should see you would straightway envy you, such"
5264,((LACUNA)),gifts would our mother give for his upbringing.'
5265,((LACUNA)),
5266,((LACUNA)),(ll. 169-183) So she spake: and the goddess bowed her head in assent.
5267,((LACUNA)),And they filled their shining vessels with water and carried them
5268,((LACUNA)),off rejoicing. Quickly they came to their father's great house and
5269,((LACUNA)),straightway told their mother according as they had heard and seen. Then
5270,((LACUNA)),she bade them go with all speed and invite the stranger to come for a
5271,((LACUNA)),"measureless hire. As hinds or heifers in spring time, when sated with"
5272,((LACUNA)),"pasture, bound about a meadow, so they, holding up the folds of their"
5273,((LACUNA)),"lovely garments, darted down the hollow path, and their hair like a"
5274,((LACUNA)),crocus flower streamed about their shoulders. And they found the good
5275,((LACUNA)),"goddess near the wayside where they had left her before, and led her to"
5276,((LACUNA)),"the house of their dear father. And she walked behind, distressed in her"
5277,((LACUNA)),"dear heart, with her head veiled and wearing a dark cloak which waved"
5278,((LACUNA)),about the slender feet of the goddess.
5279,((LACUNA)),
5280,((LACUNA)),(ll. 184-211) Soon they came to the house of heaven-nurtured Celeus and
5281,((LACUNA)),went through the portico to where their queenly mother sat by a pillar
5282,((LACUNA)),"of the close-fitted roof, holding her son, a tender scion, in her bosom."
5283,((LACUNA)),And the girls ran to her. But the goddess walked to the threshold: and
5284,((LACUNA)),her head reached the roof and she filled the doorway with a heavenly
5285,((LACUNA)),"radiance. Then awe and reverence and pale fear took hold of Metaneira,"
5286,((LACUNA)),"and she rose up from her couch before Demeter, and bade her be seated."
5287,((LACUNA)),"But Demeter, bringer of seasons and giver of perfect gifts, would not"
5288,((LACUNA)),"sit upon the bright couch, but stayed silent with lovely eyes cast down"
5289,((LACUNA)),until careful Iambe placed a jointed seat for her and threw over it a
5290,((LACUNA)),silvery fleece. Then she sat down and held her veil in her hands before
5291,((LACUNA)),her face. A long time she sat upon the stool [2506] without speaking
5292,((LACUNA)),"because of her sorrow, and greeted no one by word or by sign, but"
5293,((LACUNA)),"rested, never smiling, and tasting neither food nor drink, because"
5294,((LACUNA)),"she pined with longing for her deep-bosomed daughter, until careful"
5295,((LACUNA)),Iambe--who pleased her moods in aftertime also--moved the holy lady
5296,((LACUNA)),with many a quip and jest to smile and laugh and cheer her heart. Then
5297,((LACUNA)),Metaneira filled a cup with sweet wine and offered it to her; but she
5298,((LACUNA)),"refused it, for she said it was not lawful for her to drink red wine,"
5299,((LACUNA)),but bade them mix meal and water with soft mint and give her to drink.
5300,((LACUNA)),And Metaneira mixed the draught and gave it to the goddess as she bade.
5301,((LACUNA)),So the great queen Deo received it to observe the sacrament.... [2507]
5302,((LACUNA)),
5303,((LACUNA)),((LACUNA))
5304,((LACUNA)),
5305,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 212-223) And of them all, well-girded Metaneira first began to"
5306,((LACUNA)),"speak: 'Hail, lady! For I think you are not meanly but nobly born; truly"
5307,((LACUNA)),dignity and grace are conspicuous upon your eyes as in the eyes of kings
5308,((LACUNA)),"that deal justice. Yet we mortals bear perforce what the gods send us,"
5309,((LACUNA)),"though we be grieved; for a yoke is set upon our necks. But now, since"
5310,((LACUNA)),"you are come here, you shall have what I can bestow: and nurse me this"
5311,((LACUNA)),"child whom the gods gave me in my old age and beyond my hope, a son much"
5312,((LACUNA)),prayed for. If you should bring him up until he reach the full measure
5313,((LACUNA)),"of youth, any one of womankind that sees you will straightway envy you,"
5314,((LACUNA)),so great reward would I give for his upbringing.'
5315,((LACUNA)),
5316,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 224-230) Then rich-haired Demeter answered her: 'And to you, also,"
5317,((LACUNA)),"lady, all hail, and may the gods give you good! Gladly will I take the"
5318,((LACUNA)),"boy to my breast, as you bid me, and will nurse him. Never, I ween,"
5319,((LACUNA)),through any heedlessness of his nurse shall witchcraft hurt him nor
5320,((LACUNA)),yet the Undercutter [2508]: for I know a charm far stronger than
5321,((LACUNA)),"the Woodcutter, and I know an excellent safeguard against woeful"
5322,((LACUNA)),witchcraft.'
5323,((LACUNA)),
5324,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 231-247) When she had so spoken, she took the child in her fragrant"
5325,((LACUNA)),bosom with her divine hands: and his mother was glad in her heart. So
5326,((LACUNA)),"the goddess nursed in the palace Demophoon, wise Celeus' goodly son whom"
5327,((LACUNA)),"well-girded Metaneira bare. And the child grew like some immortal being,"
5328,((LACUNA)),not fed with food nor nourished at the breast: for by day rich-crowned
5329,((LACUNA)),Demeter would anoint him with ambrosia as if he were the offspring of
5330,((LACUNA)),a god and breathe sweetly upon him as she held him in her bosom. But at
5331,((LACUNA)),"night she would hide him like a brand in the heart of the fire, unknown"
5332,((LACUNA)),to his dear parents. And it wrought great wonder in these that he grew
5333,((LACUNA)),beyond his age; for he was like the gods face to face. And she would
5334,((LACUNA)),"have made him deathless and unageing, had not well-girded Metaneira in"
5335,((LACUNA)),her heedlessness kept watch by night from her sweet-smelling chamber and
5336,((LACUNA)),"spied. But she wailed and smote her two hips, because she feared for her"
5337,((LACUNA)),son and was greatly distraught in her heart; so she lamented and uttered
5338,((LACUNA)),winged words:
5339,((LACUNA)),
5340,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 248-249) 'Demophoon, my son, the strange woman buries you deep in"
5341,((LACUNA)),fire and works grief and bitter sorrow for me.'
5342,((LACUNA)),
5343,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 250-255) Thus she spoke, mourning. And the bright goddess,"
5344,((LACUNA)),"lovely-crowned Demeter, heard her, and was wroth with her. So with her"
5345,((LACUNA)),divine hands she snatched from the fire the dear son whom Metaneira had
5346,((LACUNA)),"born unhoped-for in the palace, and cast him from her to the ground; for"
5347,((LACUNA)),she was terribly angry in her heart. Forthwith she said to well-girded
5348,((LACUNA)),Metaneira:
5349,((LACUNA)),
5350,((LACUNA)),(ll. 256-274) 'Witless are you mortals and dull to foresee your
5351,((LACUNA)),"lot, whether of good or evil, that comes upon you. For now in your"
5352,((LACUNA)),heedlessness you have wrought folly past healing; for--be witness the
5353,((LACUNA)),"oath of the gods, the relentless water of Styx--I would have made your"
5354,((LACUNA)),dear son deathless and unageing all his days and would have bestowed on
5355,((LACUNA)),"him everlasting honour, but now he can in no way escape death and the"
5356,((LACUNA)),"fates. Yet shall unfailing honour always rest upon him, because he lay"
5357,((LACUNA)),"upon my knees and slept in my arms. But, as the years move round and"
5358,((LACUNA)),"when he is in his prime, the sons of the Eleusinians shall ever wage war"
5359,((LACUNA)),and dread strife with one another continually. Lo! I am that Demeter
5360,((LACUNA)),who has share of honour and is the greatest help and cause of joy to
5361,((LACUNA)),"the undying gods and mortal men. But now, let all the people build me"
5362,((LACUNA)),a great temple and an altar below it and beneath the city and its sheer
5363,((LACUNA)),wall upon a rising hillock above Callichorus. And I myself will teach
5364,((LACUNA)),"my rites, that hereafter you may reverently perform them and so win the"
5365,((LACUNA)),favour of my heart.'
5366,((LACUNA)),
5367,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 275-281) When she had so said, the goddess changed her stature and"
5368,((LACUNA)),"her looks, thrusting old age away from her: beauty spread round about"
5369,((LACUNA)),"her and a lovely fragrance was wafted from her sweet-smelling robes,"
5370,((LACUNA)),"and from the divine body of the goddess a light shone afar, while golden"
5371,((LACUNA)),"tresses spread down over her shoulders, so that the strong house was"
5372,((LACUNA)),filled with brightness as with lightning. And so she went out from the
5373,((LACUNA)),palace.
5374,((LACUNA)),
5375,((LACUNA)),(ll. 281-291) And straightway Metaneira's knees were loosed and she
5376,((LACUNA)),remained speechless for a long while and did not remember to take up her
5377,((LACUNA)),late-born son from the ground. But his sisters heard his pitiful wailing
5378,((LACUNA)),and sprang down from their well-spread beds: one of them took up the
5379,((LACUNA)),"child in her arms and laid him in her bosom, while another revived the"
5380,((LACUNA)),"fire, and a third rushed with soft feet to bring their mother from"
5381,((LACUNA)),her fragrant chamber. And they gathered about the struggling child and
5382,((LACUNA)),"washed him, embracing him lovingly; but he was not comforted, because"
5383,((LACUNA)),nurses and handmaids much less skilful were holding him now.
5384,((LACUNA)),
5385,((LACUNA)),(ll. 292-300) All night long they sought to appease the glorious
5386,((LACUNA)),"goddess, quaking with fear. But, as soon as dawn began to show, they"
5387,((LACUNA)),"told powerful Celeus all things without fail, as the lovely-crowned"
5388,((LACUNA)),goddess Demeter charged them. So Celeus called the countless people to
5389,((LACUNA)),an assembly and bade them make a goodly temple for rich-haired Demeter
5390,((LACUNA)),and an altar upon the rising hillock. And they obeyed him right speedily
5391,((LACUNA)),"and harkened to his voice, doing as he commanded. As for the child, he"
5392,((LACUNA)),grew like an immortal being.
5393,((LACUNA)),
5394,((LACUNA)),(ll. 301-320) Now when they had finished building and had drawn back
5395,((LACUNA)),"from their toil, they went every man to his house. But golden-haired"
5396,((LACUNA)),"Demeter sat there apart from all the blessed gods and stayed, wasting"
5397,((LACUNA)),with yearning for her deep-bosomed daughter. Then she caused a most
5398,((LACUNA)),dreadful and cruel year for mankind over the all-nourishing earth: the
5399,((LACUNA)),"ground would not make the seed sprout, for rich-crowned Demeter kept it"
5400,((LACUNA)),"hid. In the fields the oxen drew many a curved plough in vain, and much"
5401,((LACUNA)),white barley was cast upon the land without avail. So she would have
5402,((LACUNA)),destroyed the whole race of man with cruel famine and have robbed them
5403,((LACUNA)),"who dwell on Olympus of their glorious right of gifts and sacrifices,"
5404,((LACUNA)),had not Zeus perceived and marked this in his heart. First he sent
5405,((LACUNA)),"golden-winged Iris to call rich-haired Demeter, lovely in form. So he"
5406,((LACUNA)),"commanded. And she obeyed the dark-clouded Son of Cronos, and sped"
5407,((LACUNA)),with swift feet across the space between. She came to the stronghold of
5408,((LACUNA)),"fragrant Eleusis, and there finding dark-cloaked Demeter in her temple,"
5409,((LACUNA)),spake to her and uttered winged words:
5410,((LACUNA)),
5411,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 321-323) 'Demeter, father Zeus, whose wisdom is everlasting, calls"
5412,((LACUNA)),"you to come join the tribes of the eternal gods: come therefore, and let"
5413,((LACUNA)),not the message I bring from Zeus pass unobeyed.'
5414,((LACUNA)),
5415,((LACUNA)),(ll. 324-333) Thus said Iris imploring her. But Demeter's heart was not
5416,((LACUNA)),moved. Then again the father sent forth all the blessed and eternal gods
5417,((LACUNA)),"besides: and they came, one after the other, and kept calling her and"
5418,((LACUNA)),offering many very beautiful gifts and whatever right she might be
5419,((LACUNA)),pleased to choose among the deathless gods. Yet no one was able to
5420,((LACUNA)),"persuade her mind and will, so wrath was she in her heart; but she"
5421,((LACUNA)),stubbornly rejected all their words: for she vowed that she would never
5422,((LACUNA)),"set foot on fragrant Olympus nor let fruit spring out of the ground,"
5423,((LACUNA)),until she beheld with her eyes her own fair-faced daughter.
5424,((LACUNA)),
5425,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 334-346) Now when all-seeing Zeus the loud-thunderer heard this, he"
5426,((LACUNA)),"sent the Slayer of Argus whose wand is of gold to Erebus, so that having"
5427,((LACUNA)),"won over Hades with soft words, he might lead forth chaste Persephone"
5428,((LACUNA)),"to the light from the misty gloom to join the gods, and that her mother"
5429,((LACUNA)),"might see her with her eyes and cease from her anger. And Hermes obeyed,"
5430,((LACUNA)),"and leaving the house of Olympus, straightway sprang down with speed to"
5431,((LACUNA)),the hidden places of the earth. And he found the lord Hades in his house
5432,((LACUNA)),"seated upon a couch, and his shy mate with him, much reluctant, because"
5433,((LACUNA)),"she yearned for her mother. But she was afar off, brooding on her fell"
5434,((LACUNA)),design because of the deeds of the blessed gods. And the strong Slayer
5435,((LACUNA)),of Argus drew near and said:
5436,((LACUNA)),
5437,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 347-356) 'Dark-haired Hades, ruler over the departed, father Zeus"
5438,((LACUNA)),"bids me bring noble Persephone forth from Erebus unto the gods, that her"
5439,((LACUNA)),mother may see her with her eyes and cease from her dread anger with the
5440,((LACUNA)),"immortals; for now she plans an awful deed, to destroy the weakly tribes"
5441,((LACUNA)),"of earthborn men by keeping seed hidden beneath the earth, and so she"
5442,((LACUNA)),makes an end of the honours of the undying gods. For she keeps fearful
5443,((LACUNA)),"anger and does not consort with the gods, but sits aloof in her fragrant"
5444,((LACUNA)),"temple, dwelling in the rocky hold of Eleusis.'"
5445,((LACUNA)),
5446,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 357-359) So he said. And Aidoneus, ruler over the dead, smiled"
5447,((LACUNA)),grimly and obeyed the behest of Zeus the king. For he straightway urged
5448,((LACUNA)),"wise Persephone, saying:"
5449,((LACUNA)),
5450,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 360-369) 'Go now, Persephone, to your dark-robed mother, go, and"
5451,((LACUNA)),feel kindly in your heart towards me: be not so exceedingly cast down;
5452,((LACUNA)),"for I shall be no unfitting husband for you among the deathless gods,"
5453,((LACUNA)),"that am own brother to father Zeus. And while you are here, you shall"
5454,((LACUNA)),rule all that lives and moves and shall have the greatest rights among
5455,((LACUNA)),the deathless gods: those who defraud you and do not appease your power
5456,((LACUNA)),"with offerings, reverently performing rites and paying fit gifts, shall"
5457,((LACUNA)),be punished for evermore.'
5458,((LACUNA)),
5459,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 370-383) When he said this, wise Persephone was filled with joy"
5460,((LACUNA)),and hastily sprang up for gladness. But he on his part secretly gave her
5461,((LACUNA)),"sweet pomegranate seed to eat, taking care for himself that she might"
5462,((LACUNA)),"not remain continually with grave, dark-robed Demeter. Then Aidoneus the"
5463,((LACUNA)),Ruler of Many openly got ready his deathless horses beneath the golden
5464,((LACUNA)),"chariot. And she mounted on the chariot, and the strong Slayer of Argos"
5465,((LACUNA)),"took reins and whip in his dear hands and drove forth from the hall, the"
5466,((LACUNA)),"horses speeding readily. Swiftly they traversed their long course, and"
5467,((LACUNA)),neither the sea nor river-waters nor grassy glens nor mountain-peaks
5468,((LACUNA)),"checked the career of the immortal horses, but they clave the deep air"
5469,((LACUNA)),above them as they went. And Hermes brought them to the place where
5470,((LACUNA)),rich-crowned Demeter was staying and checked them before her fragrant
5471,((LACUNA)),temple.
5472,((LACUNA)),
5473,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 384-404) And when Demeter saw them, she rushed forth as does a"
5474,((LACUNA)),"Maenad down some thick-wooded mountain, while Persephone on the other"
5475,((LACUNA)),"side, when she saw her mother's sweet eyes, left the chariot and horses,"
5476,((LACUNA)),"and leaped down to run to her, and falling upon her neck, embraced her."
5477,((LACUNA)),"But while Demeter was still holding her dear child in her arms, her"
5478,((LACUNA)),"heart suddenly misgave her for some snare, so that she feared greatly"
5479,((LACUNA)),"and ceased fondling her daughter and asked of her at once: 'My child,"
5480,((LACUNA)),"tell me, surely you have not tasted any food while you were below? Speak"
5481,((LACUNA)),"out and hide nothing, but let us both know. For if you have not, you"
5482,((LACUNA)),"shall come back from loathly Hades and live with me and your father, the"
5483,((LACUNA)),dark-clouded Son of Cronos and be honoured by all the deathless gods;
5484,((LACUNA)),"but if you have tasted food, you must go back again beneath the secret"
5485,((LACUNA)),"places of the earth, there to dwell a third part of the seasons every"
5486,((LACUNA)),year: yet for the two parts you shall be with me and the other deathless
5487,((LACUNA)),gods. But when the earth shall bloom with the fragrant flowers of spring
5488,((LACUNA)),"in every kind, then from the realm of darkness and gloom thou shalt come"
5489,((LACUNA)),up once more to be a wonder for gods and mortal men. And now tell me how
5490,((LACUNA)),"he rapt you away to the realm of darkness and gloom, and by what trick"
5491,((LACUNA)),did the strong Host of Many beguile you?'
5492,((LACUNA)),
5493,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 405-433) Then beautiful Persephone answered her thus: 'Mother, I"
5494,((LACUNA)),"will tell you all without error. When luck-bringing Hermes came, swift"
5495,((LACUNA)),"messenger from my father the Son of Cronos and the other Sons of Heaven,"
5496,((LACUNA)),bidding me come back from Erebus that you might see me with your eyes
5497,((LACUNA)),"and so cease from your anger and fearful wrath against the gods, I"
5498,((LACUNA)),"sprang up at once for joy; but he secretly put in my mouth sweet food,"
5499,((LACUNA)),"a pomegranate seed, and forced me to taste against my will. Also I will"
5500,((LACUNA)),tell how he rapt me away by the deep plan of my father the Son of Cronos
5501,((LACUNA)),"and carried me off beneath the depths of the earth, and will relate"
5502,((LACUNA)),"the whole matter as you ask. All we were playing in a lovely meadow,"
5503,((LACUNA)),"Leucippe [2509] and Phaeno and Electra and Ianthe, Melita also and Iache"
5504,((LACUNA)),"with Rhodea and Callirhoe and Melobosis and Tyche and Ocyrhoe, fair as"
5505,((LACUNA)),"a flower, Chryseis, Ianeira, Acaste and Admete and Rhodope and Pluto"
5506,((LACUNA)),and charming Calypso; Styx too was there and Urania and lovely Galaxaura
5507,((LACUNA)),with Pallas who rouses battles and Artemis delighting in arrows: we were
5508,((LACUNA)),"playing and gathering sweet flowers in our hands, soft crocuses mingled"
5509,((LACUNA)),"with irises and hyacinths, and rose-blooms and lilies, marvellous to"
5510,((LACUNA)),"see, and the narcissus which the wide earth caused to grow yellow as"
5511,((LACUNA)),"a crocus. That I plucked in my joy; but the earth parted beneath, and"
5512,((LACUNA)),"there the strong lord, the Host of Many, sprang forth and in his golden"
5513,((LACUNA)),"chariot he bore me away, all unwilling, beneath the earth: then I cried"
5514,((LACUNA)),"with a shrill cry. All this is true, sore though it grieves me to tell"
5515,((LACUNA)),the tale.'
5516,((LACUNA)),
5517,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 434-437) So did they turn, with hearts at one, greatly cheer each"
5518,((LACUNA)),the other's soul and spirit with many an embrace: their heart had relief
5519,((LACUNA)),from their griefs while each took and gave back joyousness.
5520,((LACUNA)),
5521,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 438-440) Then bright-coiffed Hecate came near to them, and often"
5522,((LACUNA)),did she embrace the daughter of holy Demeter: and from that time the
5523,((LACUNA)),lady Hecate was minister and companion to Persephone.
5524,((LACUNA)),
5525,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 441-459) And all-seeing Zeus sent a messenger to them, rich-haired"
5526,((LACUNA)),"Rhea, to bring dark-cloaked Demeter to join the families of the gods:"
5527,((LACUNA)),and he promised to give her what right she should choose among the
5528,((LACUNA)),deathless gods and agreed that her daughter should go down for the third
5529,((LACUNA)),"part of the circling year to darkness and gloom, but for the two parts"
5530,((LACUNA)),should live with her mother and the other deathless gods. Thus he
5531,((LACUNA)),commanded. And the goddess did not disobey the message of Zeus; swiftly
5532,((LACUNA)),she rushed down from the peaks of Olympus and came to the plain of
5533,((LACUNA)),"Rharus, rich, fertile corn-land once, but then in nowise fruitful, for"
5534,((LACUNA)),"it lay idle and utterly leafless, because the white grain was hidden by"
5535,((LACUNA)),"design of trim-ankled Demeter. But afterwards, as springtime waxed, it"
5536,((LACUNA)),"was soon to be waving with long ears of corn, and its rich furrows to be"
5537,((LACUNA)),"loaded with grain upon the ground, while others would already be bound"
5538,((LACUNA)),in sheaves. There first she landed from the fruitless upper air: and
5539,((LACUNA)),glad were the goddesses to see each other and cheered in heart. Then
5540,((LACUNA)),bright-coiffed Rhea said to Demeter:
5541,((LACUNA)),
5542,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 460-469) 'Come, my daughter; for far-seeing Zeus the loud-thunderer"
5543,((LACUNA)),"calls you to join the families of the gods, and has promised to give you"
5544,((LACUNA)),"what rights you please among the deathless gods, and has agreed that"
5545,((LACUNA)),for a third part of the circling year your daughter shall go down to
5546,((LACUNA)),"darkness and gloom, but for the two parts shall be with you and the"
5547,((LACUNA)),other deathless gods: so has he declared it shall be and has bowed
5548,((LACUNA)),"his head in token. But come, my child, obey, and be not too angry"
5549,((LACUNA)),unrelentingly with the dark-clouded Son of Cronos; but rather increase
5550,((LACUNA)),forthwith for men the fruit that gives them life.'
5551,((LACUNA)),
5552,((LACUNA)),(ll. 470-482) So spake Rhea. And rich-crowned Demeter did not refuse
5553,((LACUNA)),"but straightway made fruit to spring up from the rich lands, so that the"
5554,((LACUNA)),"whole wide earth was laden with leaves and flowers. Then she went,"
5555,((LACUNA)),"and to the kings who deal justice, Triptolemus and Diocles, the"
5556,((LACUNA)),"horse-driver, and to doughty Eumolpus and Celeus, leader of the people,"
5557,((LACUNA)),"she showed the conduct of her rites and taught them all her mysteries,"
5558,((LACUNA)),"to Triptolemus and Polyxeinus and Diocles also,--awful mysteries which"
5559,((LACUNA)),"no one may in any way transgress or pry into or utter, for deep awe of"
5560,((LACUNA)),the gods checks the voice. Happy is he among men upon earth who has seen
5561,((LACUNA)),"these mysteries; but he who is uninitiate and who has no part in them,"
5562,((LACUNA)),"never has lot of like good things once he is dead, down in the darkness"
5563,((LACUNA)),and gloom.
5564,((LACUNA)),
5565,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 483-489) But when the bright goddess had taught them all, they"
5566,((LACUNA)),went to Olympus to the gathering of the other gods. And there they dwell
5567,((LACUNA)),"beside Zeus who delights in thunder, awful and reverend goddesses. Right"
5568,((LACUNA)),blessed is he among men on earth whom they freely love: soon they do
5569,((LACUNA)),"send Plutus as guest to his great house, Plutus who gives wealth to"

5583,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,TO DELIAN APOLLO--
5584,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,
5585,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 1-18) I will remember and not be unmindful of Apollo who shoots
5586,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"afar. As he goes through the house of Zeus, the gods tremble before him"
5587,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"and all spring up from their seats when he draws near, as he bends his"
5588,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,bright bow. But Leto alone stays by the side of Zeus who delights in
5589,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"thunder; and then she unstrings his bow, and closes his quiver, and"
5590,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,takes his archery from his strong shoulders in her hands and hangs them
5591,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,on a golden peg against a pillar of his father's house. Then she leads
5592,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,him to a seat and makes him sit: and the Father gives him nectar in a
5593,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"golden cup welcoming his dear son, while the other gods make him sit"
5594,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"down there, and queenly Leto rejoices because she bare a mighty son and"
5595,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"an archer. Rejoice, blessed Leto, for you bare glorious children, the"
5596,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"lord Apollo and Artemis who delights in arrows; her in Ortygia, and him"
5597,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"in rocky Delos, as you rested against the great mass of the Cynthian"
5598,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,hill hard by a palm-tree by the streams of Inopus.
5599,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,
5600,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 19-29) How, then, shall I sing of you who in all ways are a worthy"
5601,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"theme of song? For everywhere, O Phoebus, the whole range of song is"
5602,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"fallen to you, both over the mainland that rears heifers and over the"
5603,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,isles. All mountain-peaks and high headlands of lofty hills and rivers
5604,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,flowing out to the deep and beaches sloping seawards and havens of the
5605,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,sea are your delight. Shall I sing how at the first Leto bare you to be
5606,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"the joy of men, as she rested against Mount Cynthus in that rocky isle,"
5607,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,in sea-girt Delos--while on either hand a dark wave rolled on landwards
5608,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,driven by shrill winds--whence arising you rule over all mortal men?
5609,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,
5610,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 30-50) Among those who are in Crete, and in the township of Athens,"
5611,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"and in the isle of Aegina and Euboea, famous for ships, in Aegae and"
5612,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"Eiresiae and Peparethus near the sea, in Thracian Athos and Pelion's"
5613,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"towering heights and Thracian Samos and the shady hills of Ida, in"
5614,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,Scyros and Phocaea and the high hill of Autocane and fair-lying Imbros
5615,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"and smouldering Lemnos and rich Lesbos, home of Macar, the son of"
5616,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"Aeolus, and Chios, brightest of all the isles that lie in the sea, and"
5617,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,craggy Mimas and the heights of Corycus and gleaming Claros and the
5618,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"sheer hill of Aesagea and watered Samos and the steep heights of Mycale,"
5619,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"in Miletus and Cos, the city of Meropian men, and steep Cnidos and windy"
5620,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"Carpathos, in Naxos and Paros and rocky Rhenaea--so far roamed Leto"
5621,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"in travail with the god who shoots afar, to see if any land would be"
5622,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,willing to make a dwelling for her son. But they greatly trembled and
5623,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"feared, and none, not even the richest of them, dared receive Phoebus,"
5624,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,until queenly Leto set foot on Delos and uttered winged words and asked
5625,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,her:
5626,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,
5627,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 51-61) 'Delos, if you would be willing to be the abode of my son"
5628,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,Phoebus Apollo and make him a rich temple--; for no other will touch
5629,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"you, as you will find: and I think you will never be rich in oxen and"
5630,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"sheep, nor bear vintage nor yet produce plants abundantly. But if you"
5631,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"have the temple of far-shooting Apollo, all men will bring you hecatombs"
5632,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"and gather here, and incessant savour of rich sacrifice will always"
5633,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"arise, and you will feed those who dwell in you from the hand of"
5634,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,strangers; for truly your own soil is not rich.'
5635,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,
5636,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 62-82) So spake Leto. And Delos rejoiced and answered and said:
5637,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"'Leto, most glorious daughter of great Coeus, joyfully would I receive"
5638,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,your child the far-shooting lord; for it is all too true that I am
5639,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"ill-spoken of among men, whereas thus I should become very greatly"
5640,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"honoured. But this saying I fear, and I will not hide it from you, Leto."
5641,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,They say that Apollo will be one that is very haughty and will greatly
5642,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"lord it among gods and men all over the fruitful earth. Therefore, I"
5643,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,greatly fear in heart and spirit that as soon as he sets the light of
5644,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"the sun, he will scorn this island--for truly I have but a hard, rocky"
5645,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,soil--and overturn me and thrust me down with his feet in the depths of
5646,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"the sea; then will the great ocean wash deep above my head for ever, and"
5647,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"he will go to another land such as will please him, there to make his"
5648,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"temple and wooded groves. So, many-footed creatures of the sea will make"
5649,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"their lairs in me and black seals their dwellings undisturbed, because"
5650,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"I lack people. Yet if you will but dare to sware a great oath, goddess,"
5651,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"that here first he will build a glorious temple to be an oracle for men,"
5652,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,then let him afterwards make temples and wooded groves amongst all men;
5653,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,for surely he will be greatly renowned.'
5654,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,
5655,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 83-88) So said Delos. And Leto sware the great oath of the gods:
5656,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"'Now hear this, Earth and wide Heaven above, and dropping water of Styx"
5657,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"(this is the strongest and most awful oath for the blessed gods), surely"
5658,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"Phoebus shall have here his fragrant altar and precinct, and you he"
5659,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,shall honour above all.'
5660,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,
5661,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 89-101) Now when Leto had sworn and ended her oath, Delos was very"
5662,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,glad at the birth of the far-shooting lord. But Leto was racked nine
5663,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,days and nine nights with pangs beyond wont. And there were with her all
5664,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"the chiefest of the goddesses, Dione and Rhea and Ichnaea and Themis"
5665,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,and loud-moaning Amphitrite and the other deathless goddesses save
5666,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"white-armed Hera, who sat in the halls of cloud-gathering Zeus. Only"
5667,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"Eilithyia, goddess of sore travail, had not heard of Leto's trouble,"
5668,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,for she sat on the top of Olympus beneath golden clouds by white-armed
5669,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"Hera's contriving, who kept her close through envy, because Leto with"
5670,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,the lovely tresses was soon to bear a son faultless and strong.
5671,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,
5672,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 102-114) But the goddesses sent out Iris from the well-set isle
5673,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"to bring Eilithyia, promising her a great necklace strung with golden"
5674,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"threads, nine cubits long. And they bade Iris call her aside from"
5675,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"white-armed Hera, lest she might afterwards turn her from coming with"
5676,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"her words. When swift Iris, fleet of foot as the wind, had heard all"
5677,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"this, she set to run; and quickly finishing all the distance she came to"
5678,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"the home of the gods, sheer Olympus, and forthwith called Eilithyia out"
5679,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"from the hall to the door and spoke winged words to her, telling her all"
5680,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,as the goddesses who dwell on Olympus had bidden her. So she moved the
5681,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"heart of Eilithyia in her dear breast; and they went their way, like shy"
5682,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,wild-doves in their going.
5683,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,
5684,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 115-122) And as soon as Eilithyia the goddess of sore travail set
5685,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"foot on Delos, the pains of birth seized Leto, and she longed to bring"
5686,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,forth; so she cast her arms about a palm tree and kneeled on the soft
5687,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,meadow while the earth laughed for joy beneath. Then the child leaped
5688,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"forth to the light, and all the goddesses washed you purely and cleanly"
5689,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"with sweet water, and swathed you in a white garment of fine texture,"
5690,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"new-woven, and fastened a golden band about you."
5691,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,
5692,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 123-130) Now Leto did not give Apollo, bearer of the golden blade,"
5693,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,her breast; but Themis duly poured nectar and ambrosia with her divine
5694,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,hands: and Leto was glad because she had borne a strong son and an
5695,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"archer. But as soon as you had tasted that divine heavenly food, O"
5696,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"Phoebus, you could no longer then be held by golden cords nor confined"
5697,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"with bands, but all their ends were undone. Forthwith Phoebus Apollo"
5698,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,spoke out among the deathless goddesses:
5699,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,
5700,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 131-132) 'The lyre and the curved bow shall ever be dear to me, and"
5701,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,I will declare to men the unfailing will of Zeus.'
5702,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,
5703,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 133-139) So said Phoebus, the long-haired god who shoots afar and"
5704,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,began to walk upon the wide-pathed earth; and all goddesses were amazed
5705,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"at him. Then with gold all Delos was laden, beholding the child of Zeus"
5706,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"and Leto, for joy because the god chose her above the islands and shore"
5707,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"to make his dwelling in her: and she loved him yet more in her heart,"
5708,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,and blossomed as does a mountain-top with woodland flowers.
5709,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,
5710,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 140-164) And you, O lord Apollo, god of the silver bow, shooting"
5711,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"afar, now walked on craggy Cynthus, and now kept wandering about the"
5712,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"island and the people in them. Many are your temples and wooded groves,"
5713,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,and all peaks and towering bluffs of lofty mountains and rivers flowing
5714,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"to the sea are dear to you, Phoebus, yet in Delos do you most delight"
5715,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,your heart; for there the long robed Ionians gather in your honour with
5716,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"their children and shy wives: mindful, they delight you with boxing and"
5717,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"dancing and song, so often as they hold their gathering. A man would say"
5718,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,that they were deathless and unageing if he should then come upon the
5719,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"Ionians so met together. For he would see the graces of them all, and"
5720,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,would be pleased in heart gazing at the men and well-girded women with
5721,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,their swift ships and great wealth. And there is this great wonder
5722,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"besides--and its renown shall never perish--the girls of Delos,"
5723,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,hand-maidens of the Far-shooter; for when they have praised Apollo
5724,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"first, and also Leto and Artemis who delights in arrows, they sing a"
5725,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"strain telling of men and women of past days, and charm the tribes of"
5726,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,men. Also they can imitate the tongues of all men and their clattering
5727,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"speech: each would say that he himself were singing, so close to truth"
5728,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,is their sweet song.
5729,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,
5730,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 165-178) And now may Apollo be favourable and Artemis; and farewell
5731,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,all you maidens. Remember me in after time whenever any one of men on
5732,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"earth, a stranger who has seen and suffered much, comes here and asks of"
5733,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"you: 'Whom think ye, girls, is the sweetest singer that comes here, and"
5734,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"in whom do you most delight?' Then answer, each and all, with one voice:"
5735,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"'He is a blind man, and dwells in rocky Chios: his lays are evermore"
5736,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"supreme.' As for me, I will carry your renown as far as I roam over the"
5737,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,earth to the well-placed this thing is true. And I will never cease to
5738,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,"praise far-shooting Apollo, god of the silver bow, whom rich-haired Leto"
5739,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,bare.
5740,TO DELIAN APOLLO--,
5741,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--
5742,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
5743,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 179-181) O Lord, Lycia is yours and lovely Maeonia and Miletus,"
5744,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"charming city by the sea, but over wave-girt Delos you greatly reign"
5745,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,your own self.
5746,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
5747,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 182-206) Leto's all-glorious son goes to rocky Pytho, playing upon"
5748,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"his hollow lyre, clad in divine, perfumed garments; and at the touch of"
5749,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"the golden key his lyre sings sweet. Thence, swift as thought, he speeds"
5750,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"from earth to Olympus, to the house of Zeus, to join the gathering of"
5751,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,the other gods: then straightway the undying gods think only of the lyre
5752,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"and song, and all the Muses together, voice sweetly answering voice,"
5753,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"hymn the unending gifts the gods enjoy and the sufferings of men, all"
5754,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"that they endure at the hands of the deathless gods, and how they"
5755,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,live witless and helpless and cannot find healing for death or defence
5756,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,against old age. Meanwhile the rich-tressed Graces and cheerful Seasons
5757,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"dance with Harmonia and Hebe and Aphrodite, daughter of Zeus, holding"
5758,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"each other by the wrist. And among them sings one, not mean nor puny,"
5759,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"but tall to look upon and enviable in mien, Artemis who delights in"
5760,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"arrows, sister of Apollo. Among them sport Ares and the keen-eyed Slayer"
5761,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"of Argus, while Apollo plays his lyre stepping high and featly and a"
5762,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"radiance shines around him, the gleaming of his feet and close-woven"
5763,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"vest. And they, even gold-tressed Leto and wise Zeus, rejoice in their"
5764,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,great hearts as they watch their dear son playing among the undying
5765,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,gods.
5766,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
5767,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 207-228) How then shall I sing of you--though in all ways you are a
5768,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,worthy theme for song? Shall I sing of you as wooer and in the fields
5769,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"of love, how you went wooing the daughter of Azan along with god-like"
5770,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Ischys the son of well-horsed Elatius, or with Phorbas sprung"
5771,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"from Triops, or with Ereutheus, or with Leucippus and the wife of"
5772,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Leucippus.... ((LACUNA)) ....you on foot, he with his chariot, yet he"
5773,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,fell not short of Triops. Or shall I sing how at the first you went
5774,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"about the earth seeking a place of oracle for men, O far-shooting"
5775,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,Apollo? To Pieria first you went down from Olympus and passed by sandy
5776,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,Lectus and Enienae and through the land of the Perrhaebi. Soon you came
5777,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"to Iolcus and set foot on Cenaeum in Euboea, famed for ships: you stood"
5778,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"in the Lelantine plain, but it pleased not your heart to make a"
5779,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"temple there and wooded groves. From there you crossed the Euripus,"
5780,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"far-shooting Apollo, and went up the green, holy hills, going on to"
5781,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Mycalessus and grassy-bedded Teumessus, and so came to the wood-clad"
5782,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"abode of Thebe; for as yet no man lived in holy Thebe, nor were there"
5783,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,tracks or ways about Thebe's wheat-bearing plain as yet.
5784,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
5785,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 229-238) And further still you went, O far-shooting Apollo, and"
5786,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"came to Onchestus, Poseidon's bright grove: there the new-broken colt"
5787,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"distressed with drawing the trim chariot gets spirit again, and the"
5788,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,skilled driver springs from his car and goes on his way. Then the horses
5789,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"for a while rattle the empty car, being rid of guidance; and if they"
5790,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"break the chariot in the woody grove, men look after the horses, but"
5791,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,tilt the chariot and leave it there; for this was the rite from the very
5792,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,first. And the drivers pray to the lord of the shrine; but the chariot
5793,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,falls to the lot of the god.
5794,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
5795,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 239-243) Further yet you went, O far-shooting Apollo, and reached"
5796,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,next Cephissus' sweet stream which pours forth its sweet-flowing water
5797,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"from Lilaea, and crossing over it, O worker from afar, you passed"
5798,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,many-towered Ocalea and reached grassy Haliartus.
5799,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
5800,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 244-253) Then you went towards Telphusa: and there the pleasant
5801,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,place seemed fit for making a temple and wooded grove. You came very
5802,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"near and spoke to her: 'Telphusa, here I am minded to make a glorious"
5803,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"temple, an oracle for men, and hither they will always bring perfect"
5804,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"hecatombs, both those who live in rich Peloponnesus and those of Europe"
5805,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"and all the wave-washed isles, coming to seek oracles. And I will"
5806,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"deliver to them all counsel that cannot fail, giving answer in my rich"
5807,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,temple.'
5808,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
5809,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 254-276) So said Phoebus Apollo, and laid out all the foundations"
5810,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"throughout, wide and very long. But when Telphusa saw this, she was"
5811,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"angry in heart and spoke, saying: 'Lord Phoebus, worker from afar, I"
5812,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"will speak a word of counsel to your heart, since you are minded to make"
5813,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,here a glorious temple to be an oracle for men who will always bring
5814,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"hither perfect hecatombs for you; yet I will speak out, and do you lay"
5815,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,up my words in your heart. The trampling of swift horses and the sound
5816,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"of mules watering at my sacred springs will always irk you, and men will"
5817,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"like better to gaze at the well-made chariots and stamping, swift-footed"
5818,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,horses than at your great temple and the many treasures that are within.
5819,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"But if you will be moved by me--for you, lord, are stronger and mightier"
5820,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"than I, and your strength is very great--build at Crisa below the glades"
5821,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"of Parnassus: there no bright chariot will clash, and there will be"
5822,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,no noise of swift-footed horses near your well-built altar. But so
5823,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,the glorious tribes of men will bring gifts to you as Iepaeon
5824,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"('Hail-Healer'), and you will receive with delight rich sacrifices from"
5825,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"the people dwelling round about.' So said Telphusa, that she alone, and"
5826,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"not the Far-Shooter, should have renown there; and she persuaded the"
5827,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,Far-Shooter.
5828,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
5829,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 277-286) Further yet you went, far-shooting Apollo, until you came"
5830,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,to the town of the presumptuous Phlegyae who dwell on this earth in a
5831,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"lovely glade near the Cephisian lake, caring not for Zeus. And thence"
5832,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"you went speeding swiftly to the mountain ridge, and came to Crisa"
5833,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"beneath snowy Parnassus, a foothill turned towards the west: a cliff"
5834,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"hangs over it from above, and a hollow, rugged glade runs under. There"
5835,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"the lord Phoebus Apollo resolved to make his lovely temple, and thus he"
5836,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,said:
5837,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
5838,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 287-293) 'In this place I am minded to build a glorious temple to
5839,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"be an oracle for men, and here they will always bring perfect hecatombs,"
5840,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,both they who dwell in rich Peloponnesus and the men of Europe and from
5841,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"all the wave-washed isles, coming to question me. And I will deliver to"
5842,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"them all counsel that cannot fail, answering them in my rich temple.'"
5843,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
5844,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 294-299) When he had said this, Phoebus Apollo laid out all the"
5845,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"foundations throughout, wide and very long; and upon these the sons of"
5846,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Erginus, Trophonius and Agamedes, dear to the deathless gods, laid a"
5847,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,footing of stone. And the countless tribes of men built the whole temple
5848,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"of wrought stones, to be sung of for ever."
5849,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
5850,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 300-310) But near by was a sweet flowing spring, and there with"
5851,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"his strong bow the lord, the son of Zeus, killed the bloated, great"
5852,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"she-dragon, a fierce monster wont to do great mischief to men upon"
5853,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"earth, to men themselves and to their thin-shanked sheep; for she was a"
5854,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,very bloody plague. She it was who once received from gold-throned Hera
5855,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"and brought up fell, cruel Typhaon to be a plague to men. Once on a time"
5856,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Hera bare him because she was angry with father Zeus, when the Son of"
5857,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,Cronos bare all-glorious Athena in his head. Thereupon queenly Hera was
5858,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,angry and spoke thus among the assembled gods:
5859,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
5860,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 311-330) 'Hear from me, all gods and goddesses, how cloud-gathering"
5861,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Zeus begins to dishonour me wantonly, when he has made me his"
5862,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"true-hearted wife. See now, apart from me he has given birth to"
5863,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,bright-eyed Athena who is foremost among all the blessed gods. But my
5864,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,son Hephaestus whom I bare was weakly among all the blessed gods and
5865,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"shrivelled of foot, a shame and disgrace to me in heaven, whom I myself"
5866,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,took in my hands and cast out so that he fell in the great sea. But
5867,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,silver-shod Thetis the daughter of Nereus took and cared for him with
5868,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,her sisters: would that she had done other service to the blessed gods!
5869,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,O wicked one and crafty! What else will you now devise? How dared you by
5870,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,yourself give birth to bright-eyed Athena? Would not I have borne you a
5871,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"child--I, who was at least called your wife among the undying gods"
5872,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,who hold wide heaven. Beware now lest I devise some evil thing for you
5873,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"hereafter: yes, now I will contrive that a son be born me to be foremost"
5874,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,among the undying gods--and that without casting shame on the holy bond
5875,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"of wedlock between you and me. And I will not come to your bed, but will"
5876,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,consort with the blessed gods far off from you.'
5877,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
5878,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 331-333) When she had so spoken, she went apart from the gods,"
5879,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"being very angry. Then straightway large-eyed queenly Hera prayed,"
5880,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"striking the ground flatwise with her hand, and speaking thus:"
5881,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
5882,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 334-362) 'Hear now, I pray, Earth and wide Heaven above, and you"
5883,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Titan gods who dwell beneath the earth about great Tartarus, and from"
5884,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"whom are sprung both gods and men! Harken you now to me, one and all,"
5885,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"and grant that I may bear a child apart from Zeus, no wit lesser"
5886,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"than him in strength--nay, let him be as much stronger than Zeus as"
5887,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,all-seeing Zeus than Cronos.' Thus she cried and lashed the earth with
5888,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,her strong hand. Then the life-giving earth was moved: and when Hera saw
5889,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"it she was glad in heart, for she thought her prayer would be fulfilled."
5890,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"And thereafter she never came to the bed of wise Zeus for a full year,"
5891,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,not to sit in her carved chair as aforetime to plan wise counsel for
5892,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"him, but stayed in her temples where many pray, and delighted in her"
5893,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"offerings, large-eyed queenly Hera. But when the months and days were"
5894,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"fulfilled and the seasons duly came on as the earth moved round, she"
5895,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"bare one neither like the gods nor mortal men, fell, cruel Typhaon, to"
5896,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,be a plague to men. Straightway large-eyed queenly Hera took him and
5897,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"bringing one evil thing to another such, gave him to the dragoness; and"
5898,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,she received him. And this Typhaon used to work great mischief among the
5899,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"famous tribes of men. Whosoever met the dragoness, the day of doom would"
5900,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"sweep him away, until the lord Apollo, who deals death from afar, shot a"
5901,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"strong arrow at her. Then she, rent with bitter pangs, lay drawing great"
5902,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,gasps for breath and rolling about that place. An awful noise swelled up
5903,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,unspeakable as she writhed continually this way and that amid the wood:
5904,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"and so she left her life, breathing it forth in blood. Then Phoebus"
5905,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,Apollo boasted over her:
5906,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
5907,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 363-369) 'Now rot here upon the soil that feeds man! You at least
5908,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,shall live no more to be a fell bane to men who eat the fruit of the
5909,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"all-nourishing earth, and who will bring hither perfect hecatombs."
5910,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,Against cruel death neither Typhoeus shall avail you nor ill-famed
5911,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Chimera, but here shall the Earth and shining Hyperion make you rot.'"
5912,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
5913,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 370-374) Thus said Phoebus, exulting over her: and darkness covered"
5914,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,her eyes. And the holy strength of Helios made her rot away there;
5915,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"wherefore the place is now called Pytho, and men call the lord Apollo by"
5916,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"another name, Pythian; because on that spot the power of piercing Helios"
5917,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,made the monster rot away.
5918,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
5919,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 375-378) Then Phoebus Apollo saw that the sweet-flowing spring had
5920,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"beguiled him, and he started out in anger against Telphusa; and soon"
5921,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"coming to her, he stood close by and spoke to her:"
5922,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
5923,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 379-381) 'Telphusa, you were not, after all, to keep to yourself"
5924,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"this lovely place by deceiving my mind, and pour forth your clear"
5925,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,flowing water: here my renown shall also be and not yours alone?'
5926,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
5927,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 382-387) Thus spoke the lord, far-working Apollo, and pushed over"
5928,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"upon her a crag with a shower of rocks, hiding her streams: and he made"
5929,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,himself an altar in a wooded grove very near the clear-flowing stream.
5930,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"In that place all men pray to the great one by the name Telphusian,"
5931,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,because he humbled the stream of holy Telphusa.
5932,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
5933,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 388-439) Then Phoebus Apollo pondered in his heart what men he
5934,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,should bring in to be his ministers in sacrifice and to serve him in
5935,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"rocky Pytho. And while he considered this, he became aware of a swift"
5936,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"ship upon the wine-like sea in which were many men and goodly, Cretans"
5937,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"from Cnossos [2510], the city of Minos, they who do sacrifice to the"
5938,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"prince and announce his decrees, whatsoever Phoebus Apollo, bearer of"
5939,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"the golden blade, speaks in answer from his laurel tree below the dells"
5940,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,of Parnassus. These men were sailing in their black ship for traffic and
5941,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,for profit to sandy Pylos and to the men of Pylos. But Phoebus Apollo
5942,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"met them: in the open sea he sprang upon their swift ship, like a"
5943,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"dolphin in shape, and lay there, a great and awesome monster, and none"
5944,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,of them gave heed so as to understand [2511]; but they sought to cast
5945,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,the dolphin overboard. But he kept shaking the black ship every way and
5946,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"make the timbers quiver. So they sat silent in their craft for fear, and"
5947,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"did not loose the sheets throughout the black, hollow ship, nor lowered"
5948,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"the sail of their dark-prowed vessel, but as they had set it first of"
5949,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"all with oxhide ropes, so they kept sailing on; for a rushing south wind"
5950,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"hurried on the swift ship from behind. First they passed by Malea, and"
5951,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"then along the Laconian coast they came to Taenarum, sea-garlanded town"
5952,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"and country of Helios who gladdens men, where the thick-fleeced sheep of"
5953,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,the lord Helios feed continually and occupy a glad-some country. There
5954,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"they wished to put their ship to shore, and land and comprehend the"
5955,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,great marvel and see with their eyes whether the monster would remain
5956,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"upon the deck of the hollow ship, or spring back into the briny deep"
5957,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"where fishes shoal. But the well-built ship would not obey the helm,"
5958,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"but went on its way all along Peloponnesus: and the lord, far-working"
5959,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Apollo, guided it easily with the breath of the breeze. So the ship ran"
5960,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"on its course and came to Arena and lovely Argyphea and Thryon, the ford"
5961,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"of Alpheus, and well-placed Aepy and sandy Pylos and the men of Pylos;"
5962,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"past Cruni it went and Chalcis and past Dyme and fair Elis, where the"
5963,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Epei rule. And at the time when she was making for Pherae, exulting in"
5964,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"the breeze from Zeus, there appeared to them below the clouds the steep"
5965,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"mountain of Ithaca, and Dulichium and Same and wooded Zacynthus. But"
5966,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"when they were passed by all the coast of Peloponnesus, then, towards"
5967,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Crisa, that vast gulf began to heave in sight which through all its"
5968,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"length cuts off the rich isle of Pelops. There came on them a strong,"
5969,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"clear west-wind by ordinance of Zeus and blew from heaven vehemently,"
5970,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,that with all speed the ship might finish coursing over the briny water
5971,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,of the sea. So they began again to voyage back towards the dawn and the
5972,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"sun: and the lord Apollo, son of Zeus, led them on until they reached"
5973,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"far-seen Crisa, land of vines, and into haven: there the sea-coursing"
5974,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,ship grounded on the sands.
5975,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
5976,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 440-451) Then, like a star at noonday, the lord, far-working"
5977,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Apollo, leaped from the ship: flashes of fire flew from him thick and"
5978,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,their brightness reached to heaven. He entered into his shrine between
5979,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"priceless tripods, and there made a flame to flare up bright, showing"
5980,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"forth the splendour of his shafts, so that their radiance filled all"
5981,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Crisa, and the wives and well-girded daughters of the Crisaeans raised"
5982,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,a cry at that outburst of Phoebus; for he cast great fear upon them
5983,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"all. From his shrine he sprang forth again, swift as a thought, to speed"
5984,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"again to the ship, bearing the form of a man, brisk and sturdy, in the"
5985,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"prime of his youth, while his broad shoulders were covered with his"
5986,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"hair: and he spoke to the Cretans, uttering winged words:"
5987,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
5988,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 452-461) 'Strangers, who are you? Whence come you sailing along the"
5989,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"paths of the sea? Are you for traffic, or do you wander at random"
5990,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,over the sea as pirates do who put their own lives to hazard and bring
5991,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,mischief to men of foreign parts as they roam? Why rest you so and are
5992,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"afraid, and do not go ashore nor stow the gear of your black ship? For"
5993,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"that is the custom of men who live by bread, whenever they come to land"
5994,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"in their dark ships from the main, spent with toil; at once desire for"
5995,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,sweet food catches them about the heart.'
5996,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
5997,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 462-473) So speaking, he put courage in their hearts, and the"
5998,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,master of the Cretans answered him and said: 'Stranger--though you are
5999,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"nothing like mortal men in shape or stature, but are as the deathless"
6000,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"gods--hail and all happiness to you, and may the gods give you good. Now"
6001,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"tell me truly that I may surely know it: what country is this, and what"
6002,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"land, and what men live herein? As for us, with thoughts set otherwards,"
6003,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,we were sailing over the great sea to Pylos from Crete (for from there
6004,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"we declare that we are sprung), but now are come on shipboard to this"
6005,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,place by no means willingly--another way and other paths--and gladly
6006,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,would we return. But one of the deathless gods brought us here against
6007,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,our will.'
6008,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6009,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 474-501) Then far-working Apollo answered then and said: 'Strangers
6010,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,who once dwelt about wooded Cnossos but now shall return no more each to
6011,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,his loved city and fair house and dear wife; here shall you keep my rich
6012,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,temple that is honoured by many men. I am the son of Zeus; Apollo is my
6013,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"name: but you I brought here over the wide gulf of the sea, meaning"
6014,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"you no hurt; nay, here you shall keep my rich temple that is greatly"
6015,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"honoured among men, and you shall know the plans of the deathless gods,"
6016,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,and by their will you shall be honoured continually for all time. And
6017,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"now come, make haste and do as I say. First loose the sheets and lower"
6018,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"the sail, and then draw the swift ship up upon the land. Take out your"
6019,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"goods and the gear of the straight ship, and make an altar upon the"
6020,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,beach of the sea: light fire upon it and make an offering of white meal.
6021,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Next, stand side by side around the altar and pray: and in as much as at"
6022,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,the first on the hazy sea I sprang upon the swift ship in the form of a
6023,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"dolphin, pray to me as Apollo Delphinius; also the altar itself shall"
6024,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"be called Delphinius and overlooking [2512] for ever. Afterwards, sup"
6025,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,beside your dark ship and pour an offering to the blessed gods who dwell
6026,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"on Olympus. But when you have put away craving for sweet food, come"
6027,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"with me singing the hymn Ie Paean (Hail, Healer!), until you come to the"
6028,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,place where you shall keep my rich temple.'
6029,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6030,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 502-523) So said Apollo. And they readily harkened to him and
6031,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,obeyed him. First they unfastened the sheets and let down the sail and
6032,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"lowered the mast by the forestays upon the mast-rest. Then, landing upon"
6033,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"the beach of the sea, they hauled up the ship from the water to dry land"
6034,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,and fixed long stays under it. Also they made an altar upon the beach of
6035,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"the sea, and when they had lit a fire, made an offering of white meal,"
6036,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,and prayed standing around the altar as Apollo had bidden them. Then
6037,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"they took their meal by the swift, black ship, and poured an offering"
6038,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,to the blessed gods who dwell on Olympus. And when they had put away
6039,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"craving for drink and food, they started out with the lord Apollo, the"
6040,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"son of Zeus, to lead them, holding a lyre in his hands, and playing"
6041,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,sweetly as he stepped high and featly. So the Cretans followed him to
6042,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Pytho, marching in time as they chanted the Ie Paean after the manner of"
6043,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,the Cretan paean-singers and of those in whose hearts the heavenly Muse
6044,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,has put sweet-voiced song. With tireless feet they approached the ridge
6045,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,and straightway came to Parnassus and the lovely place where they were
6046,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,to dwell honoured by many men. There Apollo brought them and showed them
6047,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,his most holy sanctuary and rich temple.
6048,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6049,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 524-525) But their spirit was stirred in their dear breasts, and"
6050,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"the master of the Cretans asked him, saying:"
6051,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6052,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 526-530) 'Lord, since you have brought us here far from our dear"
6053,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"ones and our fatherland,--for so it seemed good to your heart,--tell us"
6054,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,now how we shall live. That we would know of you. This land is not to
6055,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,be desired either for vineyards or for pastures so that we can live well
6056,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,thereon and also minister to men.'
6057,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6058,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 531-544) Then Apollo, the son of Zeus, smiled upon them and said:"
6059,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"'Foolish mortals and poor drudges are you, that you seek cares and hard"
6060,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,toils and straits! Easily will I tell you a word and set it in your
6061,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,hearts. Though each one of you with knife in hand should slaughter sheep
6062,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"continually, yet would you always have abundant store, even all that the"
6063,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,glorious tribes of men bring here for me. But guard you my temple and
6064,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"receive the tribes of men that gather to this place, and especially show"
6065,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"mortal men my will, and do you keep righteousness in your heart. But"
6066,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"if any shall be disobedient and pay no heed to my warning, or if there"
6067,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,shall be any idle word or deed and outrage as is common among mortal
6068,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"men, then other men shall be your masters and with a strong hand shall"
6069,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,make you subject for ever. All has been told you: do you keep it in your
6070,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,heart.'
6071,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6072,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 545-546) And so, farewell, son of Zeus and Leto; but I will"
6073,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,remember you and another hymn also.
6074,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6075,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6076,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6077,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6078,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,IV. TO HERMES (582 lines)
6079,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6080,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 1-29) Muse, sing of Hermes, the son of Zeus and Maia, lord of"
6081,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Cyllene and Arcadia rich in flocks, the luck-bringing messenger of the"
6082,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"immortals whom Maia bare, the rich-tressed nymph, when she was joined"
6083,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"in love with Zeus,--a shy goddess, for she avoided the company of the"
6084,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"blessed gods, and lived within a deep, shady cave. There the son of"
6085,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Cronos used to lie with the rich-tressed nymph, unseen by deathless"
6086,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"gods and mortal men, at dead of night while sweet sleep should hold"
6087,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,white-armed Hera fast. And when the purpose of great Zeus was fixed in
6088,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"heaven, she was delivered and a notable thing was come to pass. For"
6089,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"then she bare a son, of many shifts, blandly cunning, a robber, a cattle"
6090,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"driver, a bringer of dreams, a watcher by night, a thief at the gates,"
6091,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,one who was soon to show forth wonderful deeds among the deathless gods.
6092,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Born with the dawning, at mid-day he played on the lyre, and in the"
6093,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,evening he stole the cattle of far-shooting Apollo on the fourth day
6094,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,of the month; for on that day queenly Maia bare him. So soon as he had
6095,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"leaped from his mother's heavenly womb, he lay not long waiting in his"
6096,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"holy cradle, but he sprang up and sought the oxen of Apollo. But as he"
6097,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"stepped over the threshold of the high-roofed cave, he found a tortoise"
6098,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,there and gained endless delight. For it was Hermes who first made the
6099,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"tortoise a singer. The creature fell in his way at the courtyard gate,"
6100,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"where it was feeding on the rich grass before the dwelling, waddling"
6101,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"along. When he saw it, the luck-bringing son of Zeus laughed and said:"
6102,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6103,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 30-38) 'An omen of great luck for me so soon! I do not slight it.
6104,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Hail, comrade of the feast, lovely in shape, sounding at the dance! With"
6105,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"joy I meet you! Where got you that rich gaud for covering, that spangled"
6106,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,shell--a tortoise living in the mountains? But I will take and carry you
6107,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"within: you shall help me and I will do you no disgrace, though first of"
6108,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,all you must profit me. It is better to be at home: harm may come out
6109,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"of doors. Living, you shall be a spell against mischievous witchcraft"
6110,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"[2513]; but if you die, then you shall make sweetest song."
6111,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6112,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 39-61) Thus speaking, he took up the tortoise in both hands and"
6113,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,went back into the house carrying his charming toy. Then he cut off its
6114,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,limbs and scooped out the marrow of the mountain-tortoise with a scoop
6115,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,of grey iron. As a swift thought darts through the heart of a man when
6116,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"thronging cares haunt him, or as bright glances flash from the eye, so"
6117,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,glorious Hermes planned both thought and deed at once. He cut stalks of
6118,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"reed to measure and fixed them, fastening their ends across the back and"
6119,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"through the shell of the tortoise, and then stretched ox hide all over"
6120,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,it by his skill. Also he put in the horns and fitted a cross-piece upon
6121,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"the two of them, and stretched seven strings of sheep-gut. But when he"
6122,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"had made it he proved each string in turn with the key, as he held the"
6123,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"lovely thing. At the touch of his hand it sounded marvellously; and, as"
6124,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"he tried it, the god sang sweet random snatches, even as youths bandy"
6125,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,taunts at festivals. He sang of Zeus the son of Cronos and neat-shod
6126,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Maia, the converse which they had before in the comradeship of love,"
6127,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"telling all the glorious tale of his own begetting. He celebrated, too,"
6128,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"the handmaids of the nymph, and her bright home, and the tripods all"
6129,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"about the house, and the abundant cauldrons."
6130,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6131,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 62-67) But while he was singing of all these, his heart was bent"
6132,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,on other matters. And he took the hollow lyre and laid it in his sacred
6133,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"cradle, and sprang from the sweet-smelling hall to a watch-place,"
6134,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,pondering sheer trickery in his heart--deeds such as knavish folk pursue
6135,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,in the dark night-time; for he longed to taste flesh.
6136,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6137,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 68-86) The Sun was going down beneath the earth towards Ocean
6138,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,with his horses and chariot when Hermes came hurrying to the shadowy
6139,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"mountains of Pieria, where the divine cattle of the blessed gods had"
6140,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"their steads and grazed the pleasant, unmown meadows. Of these the Son"
6141,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"of Maia, the sharp-eyed slayer of Argus then cut off from the herd fifty"
6142,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"loud-lowing kine, and drove them straggling-wise across a sandy place,"
6143,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"turning their hoof-prints aside. Also, he bethought him of a crafty ruse"
6144,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"and reversed the marks of their hoofs, making the front behind and the"
6145,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"hind before, while he himself walked the other way [2514]. Then he"
6146,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"wove sandals with wicker-work by the sand of the sea, wonderful"
6147,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"things, unthought of, unimagined; for he mixed together tamarisk and"
6148,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"myrtle-twigs, fastening together an armful of their fresh, young wood,"
6149,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"and tied them, leaves and all securely under his feet as light sandals."
6150,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,The brushwood the glorious Slayer of Argus plucked in Pieria as he was
6151,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"preparing for his journey, making shift [2515] as one making haste for a"
6152,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,long journey.
6153,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6154,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 87-89) But an old man tilling his flowering vineyard saw him as he
6155,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,was hurrying down the plain through grassy Onchestus. So the Son of Maia
6156,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,began and said to him:
6157,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6158,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 90-93) 'Old man, digging about your vines with bowed shoulders,"
6159,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"surely you shall have much wine when all these bear fruit, if you obey"
6160,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"me and strictly remember not to have seen what you have seen, and not to"
6161,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"have heard what you have heard, and to keep silent when nothing of your"
6162,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,own is harmed.'
6163,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6164,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 94-114) When he had said this much, he hurried the strong cattle on"
6165,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,together: through many shadowy mountains and echoing gorges and flowery
6166,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"plains glorious Hermes drove them. And now the divine night, his dark"
6167,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"ally, was mostly passed, and dawn that sets folk to work was quickly"
6168,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"coming on, while bright Selene, daughter of the lord Pallas, Megamedes'"
6169,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"son, had just climbed her watch-post, when the strong Son of Zeus drove"
6170,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,the wide-browed cattle of Phoebus Apollo to the river Alpheus. And they
6171,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,came unwearied to the high-roofed byres and the drinking-troughs
6172,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"that were before the noble meadow. Then, after he had well-fed the"
6173,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"loud-bellowing cattle with fodder and driven them into the byre,"
6174,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,close-packed and chewing lotus and began to seek the art of fire.
6175,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6176,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,He chose a stout laurel branch and trimmed it with the knife....
6177,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,((LACUNA)) [2516] ....held firmly in his hand: and the hot smoke rose
6178,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,up. For it was Hermes who first invented fire-sticks and fire. Next
6179,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,he took many dried sticks and piled them thick and plenty in a
6180,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"sunken trench: and flame began to glow, spreading afar the blast of"
6181,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,fierce-burning fire.
6182,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6183,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 115-137) And while the strength of glorious Hephaestus was
6184,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"beginning to kindle the fire, he dragged out two lowing, horned cows"
6185,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,close to the fire; for great strength was with him. He threw them both
6186,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"panting upon their backs on the ground, and rolled them on their sides,"
6187,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"bending their necks over [2517], and pierced their vital chord. Then he"
6188,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"went on from task to task: first he cut up the rich, fatted meat, and"
6189,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"pierced it with wooden spits, and roasted flesh and the honourable chine"
6190,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,and the paunch full of dark blood all together. He laid them there upon
6191,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"the ground, and spread out the hides on a rugged rock: and so they are"
6192,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"still there many ages afterwards, a long, long time after all this, and"
6193,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,are continually [2518]. Next glad-hearted Hermes dragged the rich meats
6194,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"he had prepared and put them on a smooth, flat stone, and divided them"
6195,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"into twelve portions distributed by lot, making each portion wholly"
6196,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"honourable. Then glorious Hermes longed for the sacrificial meat, for"
6197,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"the sweet savour wearied him, god though he was; nevertheless his proud"
6198,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"heart was not prevailed upon to devour the flesh, although he greatly"
6199,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,desired [2519]. But he put away the fat and all the flesh in the
6200,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"high-roofed byre, placing them high up to be a token of his youthful"
6201,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,theft. And after that he gathered dry sticks and utterly destroyed with
6202,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,fire all the hoofs and all the heads.
6203,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6204,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 138-154) And when the god had duly finished all, he threw his"
6205,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"sandals into deep-eddying Alpheus, and quenched the embers, covering the"
6206,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"black ashes with sand, and so spent the night while Selene's soft light"
6207,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,shone down. Then the god went straight back again at dawn to the bright
6208,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"crests of Cyllene, and no one met him on the long journey either of"
6209,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"the blessed gods or mortal men, nor did any dog bark. And luck-bringing"
6210,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Hermes, the son of Zeus, passed edgeways through the key-hole of the"
6211,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"hall like the autumn breeze, even as mist: straight through the cave he"
6212,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"went and came to the rich inner chamber, walking softly, and making no"
6213,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,noise as one might upon the floor. Then glorious Hermes went hurriedly
6214,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"to his cradle, wrapping his swaddling clothes about his shoulders as"
6215,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"though he were a feeble babe, and lay playing with the covering about"
6216,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,his knees; but at his left hand he kept close his sweet lyre.
6217,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6218,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 155-161) But the god did not pass unseen by the goddess his mother;
6219,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"but she said to him: 'How now, you rogue! Whence come you back so at"
6220,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"night-time, you that wear shamelessness as a garment? And now I surely"
6221,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,believe the son of Leto will soon have you forth out of doors with
6222,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"unbreakable cords about your ribs, or you will live a rogue's life in"
6223,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"the glens robbing by whiles. Go to, then; your father got you to be a"
6224,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,great worry to mortal men and deathless gods.'
6225,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6226,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 162-181) Then Hermes answered her with crafty words: 'Mother, why"
6227,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,do you seek to frighten me like a feeble child whose heart knows few
6228,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"words of blame, a fearful babe that fears its mother's scolding?"
6229,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Nay, but I will try whatever plan is best, and so feed myself and you"
6230,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"continually. We will not be content to remain here, as you bid, alone"
6231,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,of all the gods unfee'd with offerings and prayers. Better to live
6232,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"in fellowship with the deathless gods continually, rich, wealthy, and"
6233,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"enjoying stories of grain, than to sit always in a gloomy cave: and, as"
6234,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"regards honour, I too will enter upon the rite that Apollo has. If"
6235,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"my father will not give it to me, I will seek--and I am able--to be a"
6236,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"prince of robbers. And if Leto's most glorious son shall seek me out, I"
6237,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,think another and a greater loss will befall him. For I will go to
6238,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Pytho to break into his great house, and will plunder therefrom splendid"
6239,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"tripods, and cauldrons, and gold, and plenty of bright iron, and much"
6240,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,apparel; and you shall see it if you will.'
6241,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6242,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 182-189) With such words they spoke together, the son of Zeus who"
6243,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"holds the aegis, and the lady Maia. Now Eros the early born was rising"
6244,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"from deep-flowing Ocean, bringing light to men, when Apollo, as he went,"
6245,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"came to Onchestus, the lovely grove and sacred place of the loud-roaring"
6246,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,Holder of the Earth. There he found an old man grazing his beast along
6247,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"the pathway from his court-yard fence, and the all-glorious Son of Leto"
6248,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,began and said to him.
6249,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6250,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 190-200) 'Old man, weeder [2520] of grassy Onchestus, I am come"
6251,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"here from Pieria seeking cattle, cows all of them, all with curving"
6252,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"horns, from my herd. The black bull was grazing alone away from the"
6253,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"rest, but fierce-eyed hounds followed the cows, four of them, all of one"
6254,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"mind, like men. These were left behind, the dogs and the bull--which is"
6255,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"great marvel; but the cows strayed out of the soft meadow, away from the"
6256,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"pasture when the sun was just going down. Now tell me this, old man born"
6257,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,long ago: have you seen one passing along behind those cows?'
6258,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6259,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 201-211) Then the old man answered him and said: 'My son, it is"
6260,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,hard to tell all that one's eyes see; for many wayfarers pass to and fro
6261,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"this way, some bent on much evil, and some on good: it is difficult to"
6262,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"know each one. However, I was digging about my plot of vineyard all day"
6263,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"long until the sun went down, and I thought, good sir, but I do not know"
6264,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"for certain, that I marked a child, whoever the child was, that followed"
6265,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,long-horned cattle--an infant who had a staff and kept walking from
6266,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"side to side: he was driving them backwards way, with their heads toward"
6267,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,him.'
6268,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6269,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 212-218) So said the old man. And when Apollo heard this report,"
6270,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"he went yet more quickly on his way, and presently, seeing a long-winged"
6271,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"bird, he knew at once by that omen that thief was the child of Zeus the"
6272,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"son of Cronos. So the lord Apollo, son of Zeus, hurried on to goodly"
6273,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Pylos seeking his shambling oxen, and he had his broad shoulders covered"
6274,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"with a dark cloud. But when the Far-Shooter perceived the tracks, he"
6275,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,cried:
6276,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6277,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 219-226) 'Oh, oh! Truly this is a great marvel that my eyes behold!"
6278,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"These are indeed the tracks of straight-horned oxen, but they are turned"
6279,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,backwards towards the flowery meadow. But these others are not the
6280,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"footprints of man or woman or grey wolves or bears or lions, nor do I"
6281,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,think they are the tracks of a rough-maned Centaur--whoever it be that
6282,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,with swift feet makes such monstrous footprints; wonderful are the
6283,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"tracks on this side of the way, but yet more wonderfully are those on"
6284,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,that.'
6285,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6286,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 227-234) When he had so said, the lord Apollo, the Son of Zeus"
6287,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,hastened on and came to the forest-clad mountain of Cyllene and the
6288,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,deep-shadowed cave in the rock where the divine nymph brought forth the
6289,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,child of Zeus who is the son of Cronos. A sweet odour spread over the
6290,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"lovely hill, and many thin-shanked sheep were grazing on the grass."
6291,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,Then far-shooting Apollo himself stepped down in haste over the stone
6292,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,threshold into the dusky cave.
6293,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6294,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 235-253) Now when the Son of Zeus and Maia saw Apollo in a rage
6295,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"about his cattle, he snuggled down in his fragrant swaddling-clothes;"
6296,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"and as wood-ash covers over the deep embers of tree-stumps, so Hermes"
6297,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,cuddled himself up when he saw the Far-Shooter. He squeezed head and
6298,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"hands and feet together in a small space, like a new born child seeking"
6299,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"sweet sleep, though in truth he was wide awake, and he kept his lyre"
6300,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,under his armpit. But the Son of Leto was aware and failed not to
6301,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"perceive the beautiful mountain-nymph and her dear son, albeit a little"
6302,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,child and swathed so craftily. He peered in every corner of the great
6303,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"dwelling and, taking a bright key, he opened three closets full of"
6304,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"nectar and lovely ambrosia. And much gold and silver was stored in them,"
6305,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"and many garments of the nymph, some purple and some silvery white, such"
6306,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"as are kept in the sacred houses of the blessed gods. Then, after the"
6307,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Son of Leto had searched out the recesses of the great house, he spake"
6308,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,to glorious Hermes:
6309,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6310,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 254-259) 'Child, lying in the cradle, make haste and tell me of my"
6311,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"cattle, or we two will soon fall out angrily. For I will take and cast"
6312,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"you into dusty Tartarus and awful hopeless darkness, and neither your"
6313,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,mother nor your father shall free you or bring you up again to the
6314,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"light, but you will wander under the earth and be the leader amongst"
6315,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,little folk.' [2521]
6316,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6317,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 260-277) Then Hermes answered him with crafty words: 'Son of Leto,"
6318,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,what harsh words are these you have spoken? And is it cattle of the
6319,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,field you are come here to seek? I have not seen them: I have not heard
6320,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"of them: no one has told me of them. I cannot give news of them, nor win"
6321,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"the reward for news. Am I like a cattle-lifter, a stalwart person? This"
6322,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"is no task for me: rather I care for other things: I care for sleep, and"
6323,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"milk of my mother's breast, and wrappings round my shoulders, and warm"
6324,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,baths. Let no one hear the cause of this dispute; for this would be a
6325,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"great marvel indeed among the deathless gods, that a child newly born"
6326,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,should pass in through the forepart of the house with cattle of the
6327,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"field: herein you speak extravagantly. I was born yesterday, and my feet"
6328,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"are soft and the ground beneath is rough; nevertheless, if you will"
6329,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"have it so, I will swear a great oath by my father's head and vow that"
6330,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"neither am I guilty myself, neither have I seen any other who stole your"
6331,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,cows--whatever cows may be; for I know them only by hearsay.'
6332,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6333,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 278-280) So, then, said Hermes, shooting quick glances from his"
6334,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"eyes: and he kept raising his brows and looking this way and that,"
6335,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,whistling long and listening to Apollo's story as to an idle tale.
6336,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6337,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 281-292) But far-working Apollo laughed softly and said to him:
6338,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"'O rogue, deceiver, crafty in heart, you talk so innocently that I most"
6339,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,surely believe that you have broken into many a well-built house and
6340,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"stripped more than one poor wretch bare this night [2522], gathering his"
6341,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,goods together all over the house without noise. You will plague many
6342,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"a lonely herdsman in mountain glades, when you come on herds and"
6343,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"thick-fleeced sheep, and have a hankering after flesh. But come now, if"
6344,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"you would not sleep your last and latest sleep, get out of your cradle,"
6345,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,you comrade of dark night. Surely hereafter this shall be your
6346,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"title amongst the deathless gods, to be called the prince of robbers"
6347,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,continually.'
6348,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6349,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 293-300) So said Phoebus Apollo, and took the child and began to"
6350,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,carry him. But at that moment the strong Slayer of Argus had his
6351,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"plan, and, while Apollo held him in his hands, sent forth an omen, a"
6352,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"hard-worked belly-serf, a rude messenger, and sneezed directly after."
6353,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"And when Apollo heard it, he dropped glorious Hermes out of his hands on"
6354,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"the ground: then sitting down before him, though he was eager to go on"
6355,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"his way, he spoke mockingly to Hermes:"
6356,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6357,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 301-303) 'Fear not, little swaddling baby, son of Zeus and Maia."
6358,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"I shall find the strong cattle presently by these omens, and you shall"
6359,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,lead the way.'
6360,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6361,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 304-306) When Apollo had so said, Cyllenian Hermes sprang up"
6362,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"quickly, starting in haste. With both hands he pushed up to his ears the"
6363,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"covering that he had wrapped about his shoulders, and said:"
6364,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6365,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 307-312) 'Where are you carrying me, Far-Worker, hastiest of all"
6366,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,the gods? Is it because of your cattle that you are so angry and harass
6367,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"me? O dear, would that all the sort of oxen might perish; for it is not"
6368,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"I who stole your cows, nor did I see another steal them--whatever cows"
6369,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"may be, and of that I have only heard report. Nay, give right and take"
6370,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"it before Zeus, the Son of Cronos.'"
6371,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6372,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 313-326) So Hermes the shepherd and Leto's glorious son kept
6373,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"stubbornly disputing each article of their quarrel: Apollo, speaking"
6374,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,truly.... ((LACUNA)) ....not fairly sought to seize glorious Hermes
6375,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"because of the cows; but he, the Cyllenian, tried to deceive the God of"
6376,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"the Silver Bow with tricks and cunning words. But when, though he had"
6377,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"many wiles, he found the other had as many shifts, he began to walk"
6378,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"across the sand, himself in front, while the Son of Zeus and Leto came"
6379,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"behind. Soon they came, these lovely children of Zeus, to the top of"
6380,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"fragrant Olympus, to their father, the Son of Cronos; for there were the"
6381,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,scales of judgement set for them both.
6382,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6383,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"There was an assembly on snowy Olympus, and the immortals who perish not"
6384,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,were gathering after the hour of gold-throned Dawn.
6385,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6386,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 327-329) Then Hermes and Apollo of the Silver Bow stood at the
6387,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,knees of Zeus: and Zeus who thunders on high spoke to his glorious son
6388,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,and asked him:
6389,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6390,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 330-332) 'Phoebus, whence come you driving this great spoil, a"
6391,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,child new born that has the look of a herald? This is a weighty matter
6392,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,that is come before the council of the gods.'
6393,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6394,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 333-364) Then the lord, far-working Apollo, answered him: 'O my"
6395,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"father, you shall soon hear no trifling tale though you reproach me that"
6396,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"I alone am fond of spoil. Here is a child, a burgling robber, whom I"
6397,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,found after a long journey in the hills of Cyllene: for my part I have
6398,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,never seen one so pert either among the gods or all men that catch folk
6399,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,unawares throughout the world. He stole away my cows from their meadow
6400,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,and drove them off in the evening along the shore of the loud-roaring
6401,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"sea, making straight for Pylos. There were double tracks, and wonderful"
6402,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"they were, such as one might marvel at, the doing of a clever sprite;"
6403,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"for as for the cows, the dark dust kept and showed their footprints"
6404,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,leading towards the flowery meadow; but he himself--bewildering
6405,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"creature--crossed the sandy ground outside the path, not on his feet nor"
6406,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"yet on his hands; but, furnished with some other means he trudged his"
6407,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,way--wonder of wonders!--as though one walked on slender oak-trees. Now
6408,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"while he followed the cattle across sandy ground, all the tracks showed"
6409,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,quite clearly in the dust; but when he had finished the long way across
6410,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"the sand, presently the cows' track and his own could not be traced"
6411,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,over the hard ground. But a mortal man noticed him as he drove the
6412,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,wide-browed kine straight towards Pylos. And as soon as he had shut them
6413,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"up quietly, and had gone home by crafty turns and twists, he lay down in"
6414,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"his cradle in the gloom of a dim cave, as still as dark night, so that"
6415,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,not even an eagle keenly gazing would have spied him. Much he rubbed his
6416,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"eyes with his hands as he prepared falsehood, and himself straightway"
6417,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"said roundly: ""I have not seen them: I have not heard of them: no man"
6418,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"has told me of them. I could not tell you of them, nor win the reward of"
6419,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"telling.""'"
6420,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6421,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 365-367) When he had so spoken, Phoebus Apollo sat down. But Hermes"
6422,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"on his part answered and said, pointing at the Son of Cronos, the lord"
6423,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,of all the gods:
6424,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6425,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 368-386) 'Zeus, my father, indeed I will speak truth to you; for I"
6426,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,am truthful and I cannot tell a lie. He came to our house to-day looking
6427,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"for his shambling cows, as the sun was newly rising. He brought no"
6428,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"witnesses with him nor any of the blessed gods who had seen the theft,"
6429,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"but with great violence ordered me to confess, threatening much to throw"
6430,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"me into wide Tartarus. For he has the rich bloom of glorious youth,"
6431,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,while I was born but yesterday--as he too knows--nor am I like a
6432,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"cattle-lifter, a sturdy fellow. Believe my tale (for you claim to be"
6433,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"my own father), that I did not drive his cows to my house--so may I"
6434,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,prosper--nor crossed the threshold: this I say truly. I reverence Helios
6435,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"greatly and the other gods, and you I love and him I dread. You yourself"
6436,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,know that I am not guilty: and I will swear a great oath upon it:--No!
6437,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,by these rich-decked porticoes of the gods. And some day I will punish
6438,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"him, strong as he is, for this pitiless inquisition; but now do you help"
6439,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,the younger.'
6440,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6441,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 387-396) So spake the Cyllenian, the Slayer of Argus, while he kept"
6442,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,shooting sidelong glances and kept his swaddling-clothes upon his
6443,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"arm, and did not cast them away. But Zeus laughed out loud to see his"
6444,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,evil-plotting child well and cunningly denying guilt about the cattle.
6445,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"And he bade them both to be of one mind and search for the cattle, and"
6446,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"guiding Hermes to lead the way and, without mischievousness of heart, to"
6447,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,show the place where now he had hidden the strong cattle. Then the Son
6448,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,of Cronos bowed his head: and goodly Hermes obeyed him; for the will of
6449,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,Zeus who holds the aegis easily prevailed with him.
6450,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6451,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 397-404) Then the two all-glorious children of Zeus hastened both
6452,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"to sandy Pylos, and reached the ford of Alpheus, and came to the fields"
6453,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,and the high-roofed byre where the beasts were cherished at night-time.
6454,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,Now while Hermes went to the cave in the rock and began to drive out the
6455,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"strong cattle, the son of Leto, looking aside, saw the cowhides on the"
6456,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,sheer rock. And he asked glorious Hermes at once:
6457,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6458,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 405-408) 'How were you able, you crafty rogue, to flay two cows,"
6459,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"new-born and babyish as you are? For my part, I dread the strength that"
6460,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"will be yours: there is no need you should keep growing long, Cyllenian,"
6461,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,son of Maia!'
6462,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6463,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 409-414) So saying, Apollo twisted strong withes with his hands"
6464,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,meaning to bind Hermes with firm bands; but the bands would not hold
6465,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"him, and the withes of osier fell far from him and began to grow at once"
6466,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,from the ground beneath their feet in that very place. And intertwining
6467,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"with one another, they quickly grew and covered all the wild-roving"
6468,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"cattle by the will of thievish Hermes, so that Apollo was astonished as"
6469,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,he gazed.
6470,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6471,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 414-435) Then the strong slayer of Argus looked furtively upon
6472,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,the ground with eyes flashing fire.... desiring to hide.... ((LACUNA))
6473,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"....Very easily he softened the son of all-glorious Leto as he would,"
6474,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,stern though the Far-shooter was. He took the lyre upon his left arm and
6475,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"tried each string in turn with the key, so that it sounded awesomely at"
6476,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,his touch. And Phoebus Apollo laughed for joy; for the sweet throb of
6477,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"the marvellous music went to his heart, and a soft longing took hold on"
6478,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"his soul as he listened. Then the son of Maia, harping sweetly upon his"
6479,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"lyre, took courage and stood at the left hand of Phoebus Apollo; and"
6480,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"soon, while he played shrilly on his lyre, he lifted up his voice and"
6481,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"sang, and lovely was the sound of his voice that followed. He sang the"
6482,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"story of the deathless gods and of the dark earth, how at the first they"
6483,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"came to be, and how each one received his portion. First among the gods"
6484,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"he honoured Mnemosyne, mother of the Muses, in his song; for the son of"
6485,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,Maia was of her following. And next the goodly son of Zeus hymned the
6486,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"rest of the immortals according to their order in age, and told how each"
6487,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"was born, mentioning all in order as he struck the lyre upon his arm."
6488,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"But Apollo was seized with a longing not to be allayed, and he opened"
6489,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,his mouth and spoke winged words to Hermes:
6490,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6491,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 436-462) 'Slayer of oxen, trickster, busy one, comrade of the"
6492,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"feast, this song of yours is worth fifty cows, and I believe that"
6493,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"presently we shall settle our quarrel peacefully. But come now, tell me"
6494,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"this, resourceful son of Maia: has this marvellous thing been with you"
6495,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"from your birth, or did some god or mortal man give it you--a noble"
6496,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,gift--and teach you heavenly song? For wonderful is this new-uttered
6497,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"sound I hear, the like of which I vow that no man nor god dwelling on"
6498,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Olympus ever yet has known but you, O thievish son of Maia. What skill"
6499,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,is this? What song for desperate cares? What way of song? For verily
6500,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"here are three things to hand all at once from which to choose,--mirth,"
6501,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"and love, and sweet sleep. And though I am a follower of the Olympian"
6502,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,Muses who love dances and the bright path of song--the full-toned chant
6503,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,and ravishing thrill of flutes--yet I never cared for any of those feats
6504,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"of skill at young men's revels, as I do now for this: I am filled with"
6505,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"wonder, O son of Zeus, at your sweet playing. But now, since you, though"
6506,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"little, have such glorious skill, sit down, dear boy, and respect the"
6507,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,words of your elders. For now you shall have renown among the deathless
6508,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"gods, you and your mother also. This I will declare to you exactly: by"
6509,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,this shaft of cornel wood I will surely make you a leader renowned among
6510,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"the deathless gods, and fortunate, and will give you glorious gifts and"
6511,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,will not deceive you from first to last.'
6512,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6513,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 463-495) Then Hermes answered him with artful words: 'You question
6514,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"me carefully, O Far-worker; yet I am not jealous that you should enter"
6515,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,upon my art: this day you shall know it. For I seek to be friendly
6516,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,with you both in thought and word. Now you well know all things in your
6517,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"heart, since you sit foremost among the deathless gods, O son of Zeus,"
6518,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"and are goodly and strong. And wise Zeus loves you as all right is, and"
6519,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,has given you splendid gifts. And they say that from the utterance of
6520,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Zeus you have learned both the honours due to the gods, O Far-worker,"
6521,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"and oracles from Zeus, even all his ordinances. Of all these I myself"
6522,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"have already learned that you have great wealth. Now, you are free to"
6523,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"learn whatever you please; but since, as it seems, your heart is so"
6524,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"strongly set on playing the lyre, chant, and play upon it, and give"
6525,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"yourself to merriment, taking this as a gift from me, and do you, my"
6526,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"friend, bestow glory on me. Sing well with this clear-voiced companion"
6527,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"in your hands; for you are skilled in good, well-ordered utterance."
6528,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,From now on bring it confidently to the rich feast and lovely dance and
6529,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"glorious revel, a joy by night and by day. Whoso with wit and wisdom"
6530,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"enquires of it cunningly, him it teaches through its sound all manner"
6531,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"of things that delight the mind, being easily played with gentle"
6532,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"familiarities, for it abhors toilsome drudgery; but whoso in"
6533,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"ignorance enquires of it violently, to him it chatters mere vanity and"
6534,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"foolishness. But you are able to learn whatever you please. So then, I"
6535,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"will give you this lyre, glorious son of Zeus, while I for my part"
6536,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,will graze down with wild-roving cattle the pastures on hill and
6537,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,horse-feeding plain: so shall the cows covered by the bulls calve
6538,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"abundantly both males and females. And now there is no need for you,"
6539,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"bargainer though you are, to be furiously angry.'"
6540,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6541,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 496-502) When Hermes had said this, he held out the lyre: and"
6542,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Phoebus Apollo took it, and readily put his shining whip in Hermes'"
6543,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"hand, and ordained him keeper of herds. The son of Maia received it"
6544,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"joyfully, while the glorious son of Leto, the lord far-working Apollo,"
6545,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,took the lyre upon his left arm and tried each string with the key.
6546,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Awesomely it sounded at the touch of the god, while he sang sweetly to"
6547,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,its note.
6548,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6549,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 503-512) Afterwards they two, the all-glorious sons of Zeus turned"
6550,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"the cows back towards the sacred meadow, but themselves hastened back to"
6551,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"snowy Olympus, delighting in the lyre. Then wise Zeus was glad and made"
6552,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"them both friends. And Hermes loved the son of Leto continually, even as"
6553,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"he does now, when he had given the lyre as token to the Far-shooter,"
6554,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"who played it skilfully, holding it upon his arm. But for himself Hermes"
6555,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,found out another cunning art and made himself the pipes whose sound is
6556,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,heard afar.
6557,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6558,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 513-520) Then the son of Leto said to Hermes: 'Son of Maia, guide"
6559,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"and cunning one, I fear you may steal form me the lyre and my curved bow"
6560,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"together; for you have an office from Zeus, to establish deeds of barter"
6561,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,amongst men throughout the fruitful earth. Now if you would only swear
6562,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"me the great oath of the gods, either by nodding your head, or by the"
6563,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"potent water of Styx, you would do all that can please and ease my"
6564,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,heart.'
6565,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6566,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 521-549) Then Maia's son nodded his head and promised that he would
6567,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"never steal anything of all the Far-shooter possessed, and would never"
6568,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"go near his strong house; but Apollo, son of Leto, swore to be fellow"
6569,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"and friend to Hermes, vowing that he would love no other among the"
6570,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"immortals, neither god nor man sprung from Zeus, better than Hermes: and"
6571,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,the Father sent forth an eagle in confirmation. And Apollo sware also:
6572,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,'Verily I will make you only to be an omen for the immortals and all
6573,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"alike, trusted and honoured by my heart. Moreover, I will give you a"
6574,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"splendid staff of riches and wealth: it is of gold, with three branches,"
6575,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"and will keep you scatheless, accomplishing every task, whether of words"
6576,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"or deeds that are good, which I claim to know through the utterance of"
6577,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Zeus. But as for sooth-saying, noble, heaven-born child, of which you"
6578,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"ask, it is not lawful for you to learn it, nor for any other of the"
6579,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,deathless gods: only the mind of Zeus knows that. I am pledged and have
6580,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,vowed and sworn a strong oath that no other of the eternal gods save
6581,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"I should know the wise-hearted counsel of Zeus. And do not you, my"
6582,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"brother, bearer of the golden wand, bid me tell those decrees which"
6583,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"all-seeing Zeus intends. As for men, I will harm one and profit another,"
6584,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,sorely perplexing the tribes of unenviable men. Whosoever shall come
6585,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"guided by the call and flight of birds of sure omen, that man shall have"
6586,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"advantage through my voice, and I will not deceive him. But whoso shall"
6587,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,trust to idly-chattering birds and shall seek to invoke my prophetic
6588,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"art contrary to my will, and to understand more than the eternal gods,"
6589,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,I declare that he shall come on an idle journey; yet his gifts I would
6590,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,take.
6591,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6592,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 550-568) 'But I will tell you another thing, Son of all-glorious"
6593,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Maia and Zeus who holds the aegis, luck-bringing genius of the gods."
6594,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"There are certain holy ones, sisters born--three virgins [2523] gifted"
6595,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"with wings: their heads are besprinkled with white meal, and they dwell"
6596,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,under a ridge of Parnassus. These are teachers of divination apart from
6597,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"me, the art which I practised while yet a boy following herds, though my"
6598,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"father paid no heed to it. From their home they fly now here, now there,"
6599,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,feeding on honey-comb and bringing all things to pass. And when they are
6600,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"inspired through eating yellow honey, they are willing to speak truth;"
6601,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"but if they be deprived of the gods' sweet food, then they speak"
6602,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"falsely, as they swarm in and out together. These, then, I give you;"
6603,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,enquire of them strictly and delight your heart: and if you should teach
6604,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"any mortal so to do, often will he hear your response--if he have good"
6605,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"fortune. Take these, Son of Maia, and tend the wild roving, horned oxen"
6606,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,and horses and patient mules.'
6607,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6608,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 568a-573) So he spake. And from heaven father Zeus himself gave
6609,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"confirmation to his words, and commanded that glorious Hermes should be"
6610,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"lord over all birds of omen and grim-eyed lions, and boars with gleaming"
6611,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"tusks, and over dogs and all flocks that the wide earth nourishes, and"
6612,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,over all sheep; also that he only should be the appointed messenger to
6613,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Hades, who, though he takes no gift, shall give him no mean prize."
6614,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6615,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 574-578) Thus the lord Apollo showed his kindness for the Son of
6616,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,Maia by all manner of friendship: and the Son of Cronos gave him
6617,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,grace besides. He consorts with all mortals and immortals: a little he
6618,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"profits, but continually throughout the dark night he cozens the tribes"
6619,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,of mortal men.
6620,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6621,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 579-580) And so, farewell, Son of Zeus and Maia; but I will"
6622,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,remember you and another song also.
6623,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6624,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6625,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6626,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6627,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,V. TO APHRODITE (293 lines)
6628,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6629,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 1-6) Muse, tell me the deeds of golden Aphrodite the Cyprian, who"
6630,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,stirs up sweet passion in the gods and subdues the tribes of mortal men
6631,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,and birds that fly in air and all the many creatures that the dry
6632,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"land rears, and all the sea: all these love the deeds of rich-crowned"
6633,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,Cytherea.
6634,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6635,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 7-32) Yet there are three hearts that she cannot bend nor yet
6636,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"ensnare. First is the daughter of Zeus who holds the aegis, bright-eyed"
6637,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Athene; for she has no pleasure in the deeds of golden Aphrodite, but"
6638,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"delights in wars and in the work of Ares, in strifes and battles and"
6639,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,in preparing famous crafts. She first taught earthly craftsmen to make
6640,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"chariots of war and cars variously wrought with bronze, and she, too,"
6641,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,teaches tender maidens in the house and puts knowledge of goodly arts
6642,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,in each one's mind. Nor does laughter-loving Aphrodite ever tame in love
6643,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Artemis, the huntress with shafts of gold; for she loves archery and the"
6644,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"slaying of wild beasts in the mountains, the lyre also and dancing and"
6645,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,thrilling cries and shady woods and the cities of upright men. Nor
6646,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,yet does the pure maiden Hestia love Aphrodite's works. She was the
6647,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"first-born child of wily Cronos and youngest too [2524], by will of"
6648,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Zeus who holds the aegis,--a queenly maid whom both Poseidon and Apollo"
6649,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"sought to wed. But she was wholly unwilling, nay, stubbornly refused;"
6650,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"and touching the head of father Zeus who holds the aegis, she, that fair"
6651,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"goddess, sware a great oath which has in truth been fulfilled, that"
6652,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,she would be a maiden all her days. So Zeus the Father gave her an high
6653,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"honour instead of marriage, and she has her place in the midst of the"
6654,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,house and has the richest portion. In all the temples of the gods she
6655,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"has a share of honour, and among all mortal men she is chief of the"
6656,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,goddesses.
6657,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6658,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 33-44) Of these three Aphrodite cannot bend or ensnare the hearts.
6659,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,But of all others there is nothing among the blessed gods or among
6660,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"mortal men that has escaped Aphrodite. Even the heart of Zeus, who"
6661,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"delights in thunder, is led astray by her; though he is greatest of all"
6662,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"and has the lot of highest majesty, she beguiles even his wise heart"
6663,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"whensoever she pleases, and mates him with mortal women, unknown to"
6664,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Hera, his sister and his wife, the grandest far in beauty among the"
6665,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,deathless goddesses--most glorious is she whom wily Cronos with her
6666,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"mother Rhea did beget: and Zeus, whose wisdom is everlasting, made her"
6667,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,his chaste and careful wife.
6668,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6669,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 45-52) But upon Aphrodite herself Zeus cast sweet desire to be
6670,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"joined in love with a mortal man, to the end that, very soon, not"
6671,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,even she should be innocent of a mortal's love; lest laughter-loving
6672,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,Aphrodite should one day softly smile and say mockingly among all the
6673,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,gods that she had joined the gods in love with mortal women who bare
6674,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"sons of death to the deathless gods, and had mated the goddesses with"
6675,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,mortal men.
6676,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6677,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 53-74) And so he put in her heart sweet desire for Anchises who
6678,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,was tending cattle at that time among the steep hills of many-fountained
6679,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Ida, and in shape was like the immortal gods. Therefore, when"
6680,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"laughter-loving Aphrodite saw him, she loved him, and terribly desire"
6681,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"seized her in her heart. She went to Cyprus, to Paphos, where her"
6682,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"precinct is and fragrant altar, and passed into her sweet-smelling"
6683,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"temple. There she went in and put to the glittering doors, and there the"
6684,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,Graces bathed her with heavenly oil such as blooms upon the bodies of
6685,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"the eternal gods--oil divinely sweet, which she had by her, filled with"
6686,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"fragrance. And laughter-loving Aphrodite put on all her rich clothes,"
6687,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"and when she had decked herself with gold, she left sweet-smelling"
6688,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Cyprus and went in haste towards Troy, swiftly travelling high up among"
6689,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"the clouds. So she came to many-fountained Ida, the mother of wild"
6690,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,creatures and went straight to the homestead across the mountains. After
6691,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"her came grey wolves, fawning on her, and grim-eyed lions, and bears,"
6692,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"and fleet leopards, ravenous for deer: and she was glad in heart to"
6693,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"see them, and put desire in their breasts, so that they all mated, two"
6694,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"together, about the shadowy coombes."
6695,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6696,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 75-88) [2525] But she herself came to the neat-built shelters, and"
6697,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,him she found left quite alone in the homestead--the hero Anchises who
6698,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,was comely as the gods. All the others were following the herds over the
6699,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"grassy pastures, and he, left quite alone in the homestead, was roaming"
6700,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"hither and thither and playing thrillingly upon the lyre. And Aphrodite,"
6701,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"the daughter of Zeus stood before him, being like a pure maiden in"
6702,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"height and mien, that he should not be frightened when he took heed of"
6703,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"her with his eyes. Now when Anchises saw her, he marked her well and"
6704,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,wondered at her mien and height and shining garments. For she was clad
6705,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"in a robe out-shining the brightness of fire, a splendid robe of gold,"
6706,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"enriched with all manner of needlework, which shimmered like the moon"
6707,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"over her tender breasts, a marvel to see."
6708,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6709,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,Also she wore twisted brooches and shining earrings in the form of
6710,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,flowers; and round her soft throat were lovely necklaces.
6711,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6712,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 91-105) And Anchises was seized with love, and said to her: 'Hail,"
6713,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"lady, whoever of the blessed ones you are that are come to this house,"
6714,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"whether Artemis, or Leto, or golden Aphrodite, or high-born Themis, or"
6715,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"bright-eyed Athene. Or, maybe, you are one of the Graces come hither,"
6716,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"who bear the gods company and are called immortal, or else one of those"
6717,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,who inhabit this lovely mountain and the springs of rivers and grassy
6718,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"meads. I will make you an altar upon a high peak in a far seen place,"
6719,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,and will sacrifice rich offerings to you at all seasons. And do you feel
6720,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,kindly towards me and grant that I may become a man very eminent among
6721,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"the Trojans, and give me strong offspring for the time to come. As for"
6722,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"my own self, let me live long and happily, seeing the light of the"
6723,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"sun, and come to the threshold of old age, a man prosperous among the"
6724,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,people.'
6725,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6726,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 106-142) Thereupon Aphrodite the daughter of Zeus answered him:
6727,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"'Anchises, most glorious of all men born on earth, know that I am no"
6728,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"goddess: why do you liken me to the deathless ones? Nay, I am but a"
6729,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"mortal, and a woman was the mother that bare me. Otreus of famous name"
6730,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"is my father, if so be you have heard of him, and he reigns over all"
6731,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Phrygia rich in fortresses. But I know your speech well beside my own,"
6732,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,for a Trojan nurse brought me up at home: she took me from my dear
6733,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,mother and reared me thenceforth when I was a little child. So comes
6734,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"it, then, that I well know your tongue also. And now the Slayer of"
6735,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,Argus with the golden wand has caught me up from the dance of huntress
6736,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Artemis, her with the golden arrows. For there were many of us, nymphs"
6737,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"and marriageable [2526] maidens, playing together; and an innumerable"
6738,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,company encircled us: from these the Slayer of Argus with the golden
6739,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,wand rapt me away. He carried me over many fields of mortal men and
6740,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"over much land untilled and unpossessed, where savage wild-beasts"
6741,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"roam through shady coombes, until I thought never again to touch the"
6742,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,life-giving earth with my feet. And he said that I should be called the
6743,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"wedded wife of Anchises, and should bear you goodly children. But when"
6744,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"he had told and advised me, he, the strong Slayer of Argos, went back"
6745,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"to the families of the deathless gods, while I am now come to you: for"
6746,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,unbending necessity is upon me. But I beseech you by Zeus and by your
6747,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,noble parents--for no base folk could get such a son as you--take me
6748,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"now, stainless and unproved in love, and show me to your father and"
6749,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,careful mother and to your brothers sprung from the same stock. I shall
6750,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"be no ill-liking daughter for them, but a likely. Moreover, send a"
6751,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"messenger quickly to the swift-horsed Phrygians, to tell my father and"
6752,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,my sorrowing mother; and they will send you gold in plenty and woven
6753,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"stuffs, many splendid gifts; take these as bride-piece. So do, and then"
6754,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,prepare the sweet marriage that is honourable in the eyes of men and
6755,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,deathless gods.'
6756,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6757,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 143-144) When she had so spoken, the goddess put sweet desire in"
6758,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"his heart. And Anchises was seized with love, so that he opened his"
6759,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,mouth and said:
6760,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6761,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 145-154) 'If you are a mortal and a woman was the mother who bare
6762,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"you, and Otreus of famous name is your father as you say, and if you are"
6763,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"come here by the will of Hermes the immortal Guide, and are to be called"
6764,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"my wife always, then neither god nor mortal man shall here restrain"
6765,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"me till I have lain with you in love right now; no, not even if"
6766,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,far-shooting Apollo himself should launch grievous shafts from his
6767,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"silver bow. Willingly would I go down into the house of Hades, O lady,"
6768,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"beautiful as the goddesses, once I had gone up to your bed.'"
6769,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6770,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 155-167) So speaking, he caught her by the hand. And"
6771,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"laughter-loving Aphrodite, with face turned away and lovely eyes"
6772,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"downcast, crept to the well-spread couch which was already laid"
6773,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,with soft coverings for the hero; and upon it lay skins of bears and
6774,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,deep-roaring lions which he himself had slain in the high mountains. And
6775,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"when they had gone up upon the well-fitted bed, first Anchises took"
6776,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,off her bright jewelry of pins and twisted brooches and earrings and
6777,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"necklaces, and loosed her girdle and stripped off her bright garments"
6778,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,and laid them down upon a silver-studded seat. Then by the will of the
6779,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"gods and destiny he lay with her, a mortal man with an immortal goddess,"
6780,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,not clearly knowing what he did.
6781,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6782,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 168-176) But at the time when the herdsmen drive their oxen and
6783,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"hardy sheep back to the fold from the flowery pastures, even then"
6784,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Aphrodite poured soft sleep upon Anchises, but herself put on her rich"
6785,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"raiment. And when the bright goddess had fully clothed herself, she"
6786,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"stood by the couch, and her head reached to the well-hewn roof-tree;"
6787,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,from her cheeks shone unearthly beauty such as belongs to rich-crowned
6788,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,Cytherea. Then she aroused him from sleep and opened her mouth and said:
6789,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6790,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 177-179) 'Up, son of Dardanus!--why sleep you so heavily?--and"
6791,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,consider whether I look as I did when first you saw me with your eyes.'
6792,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6793,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 180-184) So she spake. And he awoke in a moment and obeyed her.
6794,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"But when he saw the neck and lovely eyes of Aphrodite, he was afraid"
6795,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"and turned his eyes aside another way, hiding his comely face with his"
6796,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,cloak. Then he uttered winged words and entreated her:
6797,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6798,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 185-190) 'So soon as ever I saw you with my eyes, goddess, I knew"
6799,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,that you were divine; but you did not tell me truly. Yet by Zeus who
6800,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"holds the aegis I beseech you, leave me not to lead a palsied life among"
6801,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"men, but have pity on me; for he who lies with a deathless goddess is no"
6802,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,hale man afterwards.'
6803,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6804,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 191-201) Then Aphrodite the daughter of Zeus answered him:
6805,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"'Anchises, most glorious of mortal men, take courage and be not too"
6806,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,fearful in your heart. You need fear no harm from me nor from the other
6807,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"blessed ones, for you are dear to the gods: and you shall have a dear"
6808,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"son who shall reign among the Trojans, and children's children after"
6809,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"him, springing up continually. His name shall be Aeneas [2527], because"
6810,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,I felt awful grief in that I laid me in the bed of mortal man: yet are
6811,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,those of your race always the most like to gods of all mortal men in
6812,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,beauty and in stature [2528].
6813,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6814,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 202-217) 'Verily wise Zeus carried off golden-haired Ganymedes
6815,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"because of his beauty, to be amongst the Deathless Ones and pour drink"
6816,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,for the gods in the house of Zeus--a wonder to see--honoured by all the
6817,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,immortals as he draws the red nectar from the golden bowl. But grief
6818,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,that could not be soothed filled the heart of Tros; for he knew not
6819,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"whither the heaven-sent whirlwind had caught up his dear son, so that"
6820,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"he mourned him always, unceasingly, until Zeus pitied him and gave him"
6821,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,high-stepping horses such as carry the immortals as recompense for his
6822,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"son. These he gave him as a gift. And at the command of Zeus, the Guide,"
6823,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"the slayer of Argus, told him all, and how his son would be deathless"
6824,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"and unageing, even as the gods. So when Tros heard these tidings from"
6825,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Zeus, he no longer kept mourning but rejoiced in his heart and rode"
6826,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,joyfully with his storm-footed horses.
6827,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6828,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 218-238) 'So also golden-throned Eos rapt away Tithonus who was
6829,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,of your race and like the deathless gods. And she went to ask the
6830,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,dark-clouded Son of Cronos that he should be deathless and live
6831,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,eternally; and Zeus bowed his head to her prayer and fulfilled her
6832,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,desire. Too simply was queenly Eos: she thought not in her heart to ask
6833,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,youth for him and to strip him of the slough of deadly age. So while
6834,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,he enjoyed the sweet flower of life he lived rapturously with
6835,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"golden-throned Eos, the early-born, by the streams of Ocean, at the ends"
6836,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,of the earth; but when the first grey hairs began to ripple from his
6837,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"comely head and noble chin, queenly Eos kept away from his bed, though"
6838,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,she cherished him in her house and nourished him with food and ambrosia
6839,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,and gave him rich clothing. But when loathsome old age pressed full upon
6840,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"him, and he could not move nor lift his limbs, this seemed to her in her"
6841,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,heart the best counsel: she laid him in a room and put to the shining
6842,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"doors. There he babbles endlessly, and no more has strength at all, such"
6843,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,as once he had in his supple limbs.
6844,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6845,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 239-246) 'I would not have you be deathless among the deathless
6846,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,gods and live continually after such sort. Yet if you could live on such
6847,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"as now you are in look and in form, and be called my husband, sorrow"
6848,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"would not then enfold my careful heart. But, as it is, harsh [2529] old"
6849,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,age will soon enshroud you--ruthless age which stands someday at the
6850,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"side of every man, deadly, wearying, dreaded even by the gods."
6851,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6852,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 247-290) 'And now because of you I shall have great shame among
6853,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"the deathless gods henceforth, continually. For until now they feared my"
6854,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"jibes and the wiles by which, or soon or late, I mated all the immortals"
6855,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"with mortal women, making them all subject to my will. But now my mouth"
6856,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,shall no more have this power among the gods; for very great has been my
6857,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"madness, my miserable and dreadful madness, and I went astray out of"
6858,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"my mind who have gotten a child beneath my girdle, mating with a mortal"
6859,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"man. As for the child, as soon as he sees the light of the sun, the"
6860,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,deep-breasted mountain Nymphs who inhabit this great and holy mountain
6861,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,shall bring him up. They rank neither with mortals nor with immortals:
6862,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"long indeed do they live, eating heavenly food and treading the lovely"
6863,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"dance among the immortals, and with them the Sileni and the sharp-eyed"
6864,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,Slayer of Argus mate in the depths of pleasant caves; but at their birth
6865,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"pines or high-topped oaks spring up with them upon the fruitful earth,"
6866,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"beautiful, flourishing trees, towering high upon the lofty mountains"
6867,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(and men call them holy places of the immortals, and never mortal lops"
6868,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"them with the axe); but when the fate of death is near at hand, first"
6869,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"those lovely trees wither where they stand, and the bark shrivels away"
6870,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"about them, and the twigs fall down, and at last the life of the Nymph"
6871,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,and of the tree leave the light of the sun together. These Nymphs shall
6872,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"keep my son with them and rear him, and as soon as he is come to lovely"
6873,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"boyhood, the goddesses will bring him here to you and show you your"
6874,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"child. But, that I may tell you all that I have in mind, I will come"
6875,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,here again towards the fifth year and bring you my son. So soon as ever
6876,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,you have seen him--a scion to delight the eyes--you will rejoice in
6877,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,beholding him; for he shall be most godlike: then bring him at once to
6878,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,windy Ilion. And if any mortal man ask you who got your dear son beneath
6879,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"her girdle, remember to tell him as I bid you: say he is the offspring"
6880,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,of one of the flower-like Nymphs who inhabit this forest-clad hill.
6881,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,But if you tell all and foolishly boast that you lay with rich-crowned
6882,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Aphrodite, Zeus will smite you in his anger with a smoking thunderbolt."
6883,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Now I have told you all. Take heed: refrain and name me not, but have"
6884,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,regard to the anger of the gods.'
6885,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6886,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(l. 291) When the goddess had so spoken, she soared up to windy heaven."

6896,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 1-18) I will sing of stately Aphrodite, gold-crowned and beautiful,"
6897,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,whose dominion is the walled cities of all sea-set Cyprus. There the
6898,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,moist breath of the western wind wafted her over the waves of the
6899,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"loud-moaning sea in soft foam, and there the gold-filleted Hours"
6900,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,welcomed her joyously. They clothed her with heavenly garments: on her
6901,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"head they put a fine, well-wrought crown of gold, and in her pierced"

6907,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"they saw her, giving her their hands. Each one of them prayed that he"

6919,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6920,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 1-16) I will tell of Dionysus, the son of glorious Semele, how"
6921,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"he appeared on a jutting headland by the shore of the fruitless sea,"
6922,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"seeming like a stripling in the first flush of manhood: his rich, dark"
6923,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"hair was waving about him, and on his strong shoulders he wore a purple"
6924,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,robe. Presently there came swiftly over the sparkling sea Tyrsenian
6925,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,[2530] pirates on a well-decked ship--a miserable doom led them on. When
6926,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"they saw him they made signs to one another and sprang out quickly, and"
6927,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"seizing him straightway, put him on board their ship exultingly; for"
6928,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,they thought him the son of heaven-nurtured kings. They sought to bind
6929,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"him with rude bonds, but the bonds would not hold him, and the withes"
6930,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,fell far away from his hands and feet: and he sat with a smile in his
6931,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,dark eyes. Then the helmsman understood all and cried out at once to his
6932,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,fellows and said:
6933,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6934,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 17-24) 'Madmen! What god is this whom you have taken and bind,"
6935,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,strong that he is? Not even the well-built ship can carry him. Surely
6936,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"this is either Zeus or Apollo who has the silver bow, or Poseidon, for"
6937,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,he looks not like mortal men but like the gods who dwell on Olympus.
6938,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"Come, then, let us set him free upon the dark shore at once: do not lay"
6939,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"hands on him, lest he grow angry and stir up dangerous winds and heavy"
6940,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,squalls.'
6941,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6942,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,(ll. 25-31) So said he: but the master chid him with taunting words:
6943,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"'Madman, mark the wind and help hoist sail on the ship: catch all the"
6944,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,sheets. As for this fellow we men will see to him: I reckon he is bound
6945,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,for Egypt or for Cyprus or to the Hyperboreans or further still. But in
6946,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,the end he will speak out and tell us his friends and all his wealth and
6947,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"his brothers, now that providence has thrown him in our way.'"
6948,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6949,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 32-54) When he had said this, he had mast and sail hoisted on the"
6950,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"ship, and the wind filled the sail and the crew hauled taut the sheets"
6951,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,on either side. But soon strange things were seen among them. First of
6952,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"all sweet, fragrant wine ran streaming throughout all the black ship"
6953,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"and a heavenly smell arose, so that all the seamen were seized with"
6954,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,amazement when they saw it. And all at once a vine spread out both ways
6955,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"along the top of the sail with many clusters hanging down from it, and a"
6956,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"dark ivy-plant twined about the mast, blossoming with flowers, and with"
6957,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,rich berries growing on it; and all the thole-pins were covered with
6958,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"garlands. When the pirates saw all this, then at last they bade the"
6959,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,helmsman to put the ship to land. But the god changed into a dreadful
6960,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"lion there on the ship, in the bows, and roared loudly: amidships also"
6961,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"he showed his wonders and created a shaggy bear which stood up ravening,"
6962,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,while on the forepeak was the lion glaring fiercely with scowling brows.
6963,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,And so the sailors fled into the stern and crowded bemused about the
6964,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"right-minded helmsman, until suddenly the lion sprang upon the master"
6965,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,and seized him; and when the sailors saw it they leapt out overboard one
6966,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"and all into the bright sea, escaping from a miserable fate, and were"
6967,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,changed into dolphins. But on the helmsman Dionysus had mercy and held
6968,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"him back and made him altogether happy, saying to him:"
6969,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,
6970,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,"(ll. 55-57) 'Take courage, good...; you have found favour with my heart."
6971,TO PYTHIAN APOLLO--,I am loud-crying Dionysus whom Cadmus' daughter Semele bare of union

7735,FRAGMENTS OF THE EPIC CYCLE,is fairest. The three are led by Hermes at the command of Zeus to

7742,FRAGMENTS OF THE EPIC CYCLE,Alexandrus next lands in Lacedaemon and is entertained by the sons of
7743,FRAGMENTS OF THE EPIC CYCLE,"Tyndareus, and afterwards by Menelaus in Sparta, where in the course of"
7744,FRAGMENTS OF THE EPIC CYCLE,a feast he gives gifts to Helen.
7745,FRAGMENTS OF THE EPIC CYCLE,
7746,FRAGMENTS OF THE EPIC CYCLE,"After this, Menelaus sets sail for Crete, ordering Helen to furnish the"

7760,FRAGMENTS OF THE EPIC CYCLE,"returns and plans an expedition against Ilium with his brother, and"
7761,FRAGMENTS OF THE EPIC CYCLE,then goes on to Nestor. Nestor in a digression tells him how Epopeus was

7768,FRAGMENTS OF THE EPIC CYCLE,
7769,FRAGMENTS OF THE EPIC CYCLE,All the leaders then meet together at Aulis and sacrifice. The incident

7771,FRAGMENTS OF THE EPIC CYCLE,"Calchas foretells what is going to befall. After this, they put out to"
7772,FRAGMENTS OF THE EPIC CYCLE,"sea, and reach Teuthrania and sack it, taking it for Ilium. Telephus"
7773,FRAGMENTS OF THE EPIC CYCLE,"comes out to the rescue and kills Thersander and son of Polyneices, and"
7774,FRAGMENTS OF THE EPIC CYCLE,is himself wounded by Achilles. As they put out from Mysia a storm comes

7776,FRAGMENTS OF THE EPIC CYCLE,"married Deidameia, the daughter of Lycomedes, and then heals Telephus,"
7777,FRAGMENTS OF THE EPIC CYCLE,"who had been led by an oracle to go to Argos, so that he might be their"

7779,FRAGMENTS OF THE EPIC CYCLE,
7780,FRAGMENTS OF THE EPIC CYCLE,"When the expedition had mustered a second time at Aulis, Agamemnon,"
7781,FRAGMENTS OF THE EPIC CYCLE,"while at the chase, shot a stag and boasted that he surpassed even"
7782,FRAGMENTS OF THE EPIC CYCLE,Artemis. At this the goddess was so angry that she sent stormy winds and
7783,FRAGMENTS OF THE EPIC CYCLE,prevented them from sailing. Calchas then told them of the anger of the
7784,FRAGMENTS OF THE EPIC CYCLE,goddess and bade them sacrifice Iphigeneia to Artemis. This they attempt

7786,FRAGMENTS OF THE EPIC CYCLE,
7787,FRAGMENTS OF THE EPIC CYCLE,"Artemis, however, snatched her away and transported her to the Tauri,"

7792,FRAGMENTS OF THE EPIC CYCLE,Philoctetes is bitten by a snake and is left behind in Lemnos because
7793,FRAGMENTS OF THE EPIC CYCLE,"of the stench of his sore. Here, too, Achilles quarrels with Agamemnon"
7794,FRAGMENTS OF THE EPIC CYCLE,"because he is invited late. Then the Greeks tried to land at Ilium, but"

8168,((LACUNA)),"from the rocks, others to burn it up, while others said they ought to"

8432,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,THE BATTLE OF FROGS AND MICE (303 lines)
8433,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,
8434,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,(ll. 1-8) Here I begin: and first I pray the choir of the Muses to
8435,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,come down from Helicon into my heart to aid the lay which I have newly
8436,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,written in tablets upon my knee. Fain would I sound in all men's ears
8437,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"that awful strife, that clamorous deed of war, and tell how the Mice"
8438,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,proved their valour on the Frogs and rivalled the exploits of the
8439,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"Giants, those earth-born men, as the tale was told among mortals. Thus"
8440,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,did the war begin.
8441,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,
8442,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"(ll. 9-12) One day a thirsty Mouse who had escaped the ferret, dangerous"
8443,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"foe, set his soft muzzle to the lake's brink and revelled in the sweet"
8444,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,water. There a loud-voiced pond-larker spied him: and uttered such words
8445,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,as these.
8446,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,
8447,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"(ll. 13-23) 'Stranger, who are you? Whence come you to this shore, and"
8448,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,who is he who begot you? Tell me all this truly and let me not find you
8449,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"lying. For if I find you worthy to be my friend, I will take you to my"
8450,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,house and give you many noble gifts such as men give to their guests.
8451,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"I am the king Puff-jaw, and am honoured in all the pond, being ruler"
8452,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,of the Frogs continually. The father that brought me up was Mud-man who
8453,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"mated with Waterlady by the banks of Eridanus. I see, indeed, that you"
8454,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"are well-looking and stouter than the ordinary, a sceptred king and a"
8455,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"warrior in fight; but, come, make haste and tell me your descent.'"
8456,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,
8457,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,(ll. 24-55) Then Crumb-snatcher answered him and said: 'Why do you ask
8458,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"my race, which is well-known amongst all, both men and gods and the"
8459,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"birds of heaven? Crumb-snatcher am I called, and I am the son of"
8460,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,Bread-nibbler--he was my stout-hearted father--and my mother was
8461,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"Quern-licker, the daughter of Ham-gnawer the king: she bare me in the"
8462,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"mouse-hole and nourished me with food, figs and nuts and dainties of"
8463,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"all kinds. But how are you to make me your friend, who am altogether"
8464,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"different in nature? For you get your living in the water, but I am used"
8465,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,to each such foods as men have: I never miss the thrice-kneaded loaf
8466,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"in its neat, round basket, or the thin-wrapped cake full of sesame and"
8467,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"cheese, or the slice of ham, or liver vested in white fat, or cheese"
8468,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"just curdled from sweet milk, or delicious honey-cake which even the"
8469,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"blessed gods long for, or any of all those cates which cooks make for"
8470,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"the feasts of mortal men, larding their pots and pans with spices of all"
8471,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"kinds. In battle I have never flinched from the cruel onset, but plunged"
8472,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,straight into the fray and fought among the foremost. I fear not man
8473,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"though he has a big body, but run along his bed and bite the tip of"
8474,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,his toe and nibble at his heel; and the man feels no hurt and his sweet
8475,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,sleep is not broken by my biting. But there are two things I fear above
8476,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"all else the whole world over, the hawk and the ferret--for these bring"
8477,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,great grief on me--and the piteous trap wherein is treacherous death.
8478,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,Most of all I fear the ferret of the keener sort which follows you still
8479,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,even when you dive down your hole. [3601] I gnaw no radishes and cabbages
8480,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"and pumpkins, nor feed on green leeks and parsley; for these are food"
8481,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,for you who live in the lake.'
8482,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,
8483,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,(ll. 56-64) Then Puff-jaw answered him with a smile: 'Stranger you boast
8484,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,too much of belly-matters: we too have many marvels to be seen both in
8485,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,the lake and on the shore. For the Son of Chronos has given us Frogs the
8486,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"power to lead a double life, dwelling at will in two separate elements;"
8487,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,and so we both leap on land and plunge beneath the water. If you would
8488,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"learn of all these things, 'tis easy done: just mount upon my back and"
8489,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"hold me tight lest you be lost, and so you shall come rejoicing to my"
8490,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,house.'
8491,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,
8492,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"(ll. 65-81) So said he, and offered his back. And the Mouse mounted at"
8493,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"once, putting his paws upon the other's sleek neck and vaulting nimbly."
8494,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"Now at first, while he still saw the land near by, he was pleased, and"
8495,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,was delighted with Puff-jaw's swimming; but when dark waves began to
8496,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"wash over him, he wept loudly and blamed his unlucky change of mind: he"
8497,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"tore his fur and tucked his paws in against his belly, while within him"
8498,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,his heart quaked by reason of the strangeness: and he longed to get to
8499,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"land, groaning terribly through the stress of chilling fear. He put out"
8500,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"his tail upon the water and worked it like a steering oar, and prayed"
8501,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,to heaven that he might get to land. But when the dark waves washed over
8502,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,him he cried aloud and said: 'Not in such wise did the bull bear on his
8503,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"back the beloved load, when he brought Europa across the sea to Crete,"
8504,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"as this Frog carries me over the water to his house, raising his yellow"
8505,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,back in the pale water.'
8506,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,
8507,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"(ll. 82-92) Then suddenly a water-snake appeared, a horrid sight for"
8508,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"both alike, and held his neck upright above the water. And when he saw"
8509,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"it, Puff-jaw dived at once, and never thought how helpless a friend he"
8510,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"would leave perishing; but down to the bottom of the lake he went, and"
8511,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"escaped black death. But the Mouse, so deserted, at once fell on his"
8512,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"back, in the water. He wrung his paws and squeaked in agony of death:"
8513,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,many times he sank beneath the water and many times he rose up again
8514,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"kicking. But he could not escape his doom, for his wet fur weighed him"
8515,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"down heavily. Then at the last, as he was dying, he uttered these words."
8516,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,
8517,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"(ll. 93-98) 'Ah, Puff-jaw, you shall not go unpunished for this"
8518,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"treachery! You threw me, a castaway, off your body as from a rock."
8519,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"Vile coward! On land you would not have been the better man, boxing, or"
8520,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"wrestling, or running; but now you have tricked me and cast me in the"
8521,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"water. Heaven has an avenging eye, and surely the host of Mice will"
8522,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,punish you and not let you escape.'
8523,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,
8524,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,(ll. 99-109) With these words he breathed out his soul upon the water.
8525,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"But Lick-platter as he sat upon the soft bank saw him die and, raising"
8526,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"a dreadful cry, ran and told the Mice. And when they heard of his fate,"
8527,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"all the Mice were seized with fierce anger, and bade their"
8528,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,heralds summon the people to assemble towards dawn at the house of
8529,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"Bread-nibbler, the father of hapless Crumb-snatcher who lay outstretched"
8530,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"on the water face up, a lifeless corpse, and no longer near the bank,"
8531,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"poor wretch, but floating in the midst of the deep. And when the Mice"
8532,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"came in haste at dawn, Bread-nibbler stood up first, enraged at his"
8533,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"son's death, and thus he spoke."
8534,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,
8535,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"(ll. 110-121) 'Friends, even if I alone had suffered great wrong from"
8536,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"the Frogs, assuredly this is a first essay at mischief for you all. And"
8537,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"now I am pitiable, for I have lost three sons. First the abhorred ferret"
8538,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"seized and killed one of them, catching him outside the hole; then"
8539,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,ruthless men dragged another to his doom when by unheard-of arts they
8540,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"had contrived a wooden snare, a destroyer of Mice, which they call a"
8541,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"trap. There was a third whom I and his dear mother loved well, and him"
8542,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"Puff-jaw has carried out into the deep and drowned. Come, then, and let"
8543,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,us arm ourselves and go out against them when we have arrayed ourselves
8544,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,in rich-wrought arms.'
8545,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,
8546,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,(ll. 122-131) With such words he persuaded them all to gird themselves.
8547,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,And Ares who has charge of war equipped them. First they fastened on
8548,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,greaves and covered their shins with green bean-pods broken into two
8549,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"parts which they had gnawed out, standing over them all night. Their"
8550,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"breast plates were of skin stretched on reeds, skilfully made from a"
8551,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"ferret they had flayed. For shields each had the centre-piece of a lamp,"
8552,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"and their spears were long needles all of bronze, the work of Ares, and"
8553,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,the helmets upon their temples were pea-nut shells.
8554,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,
8555,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,(ll. 132-138) So the Mice armed themselves. But when the Frogs were
8556,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"aware of it, they rose up out of the water and coming together to one"
8557,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,place gathered a council of grievous war. And while they were asking
8558,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"whence the quarrel arose, and what the cause of this anger, a"
8559,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"herald drew near bearing a wand in his paws, Pot-visitor the son"
8560,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"of great-hearted Cheese-carver. He brought the grim message of war,"
8561,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,speaking thus:
8562,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,
8563,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"(ll. 139-143) 'Frogs, the Mice have sent me with their threats against"
8564,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"you, and bid you arm yourselves for war and battle; for they have seen"
8565,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"Crumb-snatcher in the water whom your king Puff-jaw slew. Fight, then,"
8566,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,as many of you as are warriors among the Frogs.'
8567,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,
8568,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,(ll. 144-146) With these words he explained the matter. So when this
8569,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"blameless speech came to their ears, the proud Frogs were disturbed in"
8570,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,their hearts and began to blame Puff-jaw. But he rose up and said:
8571,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,
8572,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"(ll. 147-159) 'Friends, I killed no Mouse, nor did I see one perishing."
8573,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,Surely he was drowned while playing by the lake and imitating the
8574,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"swimming of the Frogs, and now these wretches blame me who am guiltless."
8575,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,Come then; let us take counsel how we may utterly destroy the wily Mice.
8576,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"Moreover, I will tell you what I think to be the best. Let us all gird"
8577,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"on our armour and take our stand on the very brink of the lake, where"
8578,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,the ground breaks down sheer: then when they come out and charge upon
8579,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"us, let each seize by the crest the Mouse who attacks him, and cast them"
8580,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,with their helmets into the lake; for so we shall drown these dry-hobs
8581,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"[3602] in the water, and merrily set up here a trophy of victory over the"
8582,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,slaughtered Mice.'
8583,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,
8584,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,(ll. 160-167) By this speech he persuaded them to arm themselves.
8585,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,
8586,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"They covered their shins with leaves of mallows, and had breastplates"
8587,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"made of fine green beet-leaves, and cabbage-leaves, skilfully fashioned,"
8588,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"for shields. Each one was equipped with a long, pointed rush for a"
8589,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"spear, and smooth snail-shells to cover their heads. Then they stood"
8590,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"in close-locked ranks upon the high bank, waving their spears, and were"
8591,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"filled, each of them, with courage."
8592,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,
8593,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,(ll. 168-173) Now Zeus called the gods to starry heaven and showed them
8594,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"the martial throng and the stout warriors so many and so great, all"
8595,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,bearing long spears; for they were as the host of the Centaurs and the
8596,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,Giants. Then he asked with a sly smile; 'Who of the deathless gods will
8597,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,help the Frogs and who the Mice?'
8598,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,
8599,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,And he said to Athena;
8600,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,
8601,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"(ll. 174-176) 'My daughter, will you go aid the Mice? For they all"
8602,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"frolic about your temple continually, delighting in the fat of sacrifice"
8603,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,and in all kinds of food.'
8604,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,
8605,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,(ll. 177-196) So then said the son of Cronos. But Athena answered him:
8606,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"'I would never go to help the Mice when they are hard pressed, for they"
8607,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"have done me much mischief, spoiling my garlands and my lamps too,"
8608,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,to get the oil. And this thing that they have done vexes my heart
8609,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"exceedingly: they have eaten holes in my sacred robe, which I wove"
8610,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"painfully spinning a fine woof on a fine warp, and made it full of"
8611,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,holes. And now the money-lender is at me and charges me interest which
8612,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"is a bitter thing for immortals. For I borrowed to do my weaving, and"
8613,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,have nothing with which to repay. Yet even so I will not help the Frogs;
8614,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"for they also are not considerable: once, when I was returning early"
8615,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"from war, I was very tired, and though I wanted to sleep, they would not"
8616,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,let me even doze a little for their outcry; and so I lay sleepless with
8617,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"a headache until cock-crow. No, gods, let us refrain from helping these"
8618,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"hosts, or one of us may get wounded with a sharp spear; for they fight"
8619,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"hand to hand, even if a god comes against them. Let us rather all amuse"
8620,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,ourselves watching the fight from heaven.'
8621,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,
8622,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"(ll. 197-198) So said Athena. And the other gods agreed with her, and"
8623,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,all went in a body to one place.
8624,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,
8625,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,(ll. 199-201) Then gnats with great trumpets sounded the fell note
8626,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"of war, and Zeus the son of Cronos thundered from heaven, a sign of"
8627,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,grievous battle.
8628,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,
8629,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"(ll. 202-223) First Loud-croaker wounded Lickman in the belly, right"
8630,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,through the midriff. Down fell he on his face and soiled his soft fur
8631,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,in the dust: he fell with a thud and his armour clashed about him. Next
8632,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"Troglodyte shot at the son of Mudman, and drove the strong spear deep"
8633,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"into his breast; so he fell, and black death seized him and his spirit"
8634,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,flitted forth from his mouth. Then Beety struck Pot-visitor to the heart
8635,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"and killed him, and Bread-nibbler hit Loud-crier in the belly, so that"
8636,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,he fell on his face and his spirit flitted forth from his limbs. Now
8637,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"when Pond-larker saw Loud-crier perishing, he struck in quickly and"
8638,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"wounded Troglodyte in his soft neck with a rock like a mill-stone, so"
8639,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"that darkness veiled his eyes. Thereat Ocimides was seized with grief,"
8640,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,and struck out with his sharp reed and did not draw his spear back to
8641,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"him again, but felled his enemy there and then. And Lickman shot at him"
8642,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,with a bright spear and hit him unerringly in the midriff. And as he
8643,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"marked Cabbage-eater running away, he fell on the steep bank, yet even"
8644,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,so did not cease fighting but smote that other so that he fell and
8645,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,did not rise again; and the lake was dyed with red blood as he lay
8646,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,"outstretched along the shore, pierced through the guts and shining"
8647,NON-CYCLIC POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER,flanks. Also he slew Cheese-eater on the very brink....

8649,((LACUNA)),((LACUNA))
8650,((LACUNA)),
8651,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 224-251) But Reedy took to flight when he saw Ham-nibbler,"
8652,((LACUNA)),"and fled, plunging into the lake and throwing away his shield. Then"
8653,((LACUNA)),blameless Pot-visitor killed Brewer and Water-larked killed the lord
8654,((LACUNA)),"Ham-nibbler, striking him on the head with a pebble, so that his brains"
8655,((LACUNA)),flowed out at his nostrils and the earth was bespattered with blood.
8656,((LACUNA)),Faultless Muck-coucher sprang upon Lick-platter and killed him with his
8657,((LACUNA)),"spear and brought darkness upon his eyes: and Leeky saw it, and dragged"
8658,((LACUNA)),"Lick-platter by the foot, though he was dead, and choked him in the"
8659,((LACUNA)),"lake. But Crumb-snatcher was fighting to avenge his dead comrades, and"
8660,((LACUNA)),hit Leeky before he reached the land; and he fell forward at the blow
8661,((LACUNA)),"and his soul went down to Hades. And seeing this, the Cabbage-climber"
8662,((LACUNA)),"took a clod of mud and hurled it at the Mouse, plastering all his"
8663,((LACUNA)),forehead and nearly blinding him. Thereat Crumb-snatcher was enraged and
8664,((LACUNA)),"caught up in his strong hand a huge stone that lay upon the ground, a"
8665,((LACUNA)),heavy burden for the soil: with that he hit Cabbage-climber below the
8666,((LACUNA)),"knee and splintered his whole right shin, hurling him on his back in the"
8667,((LACUNA)),"dust. But Croakperson kept him off, and rushing at the Mouse in turn,"
8668,((LACUNA)),hit him in the middle of the belly and drove the whole reed-spear into
8669,((LACUNA)),"him, and as he drew the spear back to him with his strong hand, all his"
8670,((LACUNA)),foe's bowels gushed out upon the ground. And when Troglodyte saw the
8671,((LACUNA)),"deed, as he was limping away from the fight on the river bank, he shrank"
8672,((LACUNA)),"back sorely moved, and leaped into a trench to escape sheer death. Then"
8673,((LACUNA)),Bread-nibbler hit Puff-jaw on the toes--he came up at the last from the
8674,((LACUNA)),lake and was greatly distressed....
8675,((LACUNA)),
8676,((LACUNA)),((LACUNA))
8677,((LACUNA)),
8678,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 252-259) And when Leeky saw him fallen forward, but still half"
8679,((LACUNA)),"alive, he pressed through those who fought in front and hurled a sharp"
8680,((LACUNA)),reed at him; but the point of the spear was stayed and did not break
8681,((LACUNA)),"his shield. Then noble Rueful, like Ares himself, struck his flawless"
8682,((LACUNA)),head-piece made of four pots--he only among the Frogs showed prowess in
8683,((LACUNA)),"the throng. But when he saw the other rush at him, he did not stay to"
8684,((LACUNA)),meet the stout-hearted hero but dived down to the depths of the lake.
8685,((LACUNA)),
8686,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 260-271) Now there was one among the Mice, Slice-snatcher,"
8687,((LACUNA)),"who excelled the rest, dear son of Gnawer the son of blameless"
8688,((LACUNA)),Bread-stealer. He went to his house and bade his son take part in the
8689,((LACUNA)),"war. This warrior threatened to destroy the race of Frogs utterly [3603],"
8690,((LACUNA)),"and splitting a chestnut-husk into two parts along the joint, put the"
8691,((LACUNA)),two hollow pieces as armour on his paws: then straightway the Frogs were
8692,((LACUNA)),"dismayed and all rushed down to the lake, and he would have made good"
8693,((LACUNA)),"his boast--for he had great strength--had not the Son of Cronos, the"
8694,((LACUNA)),"Father of men and gods, been quick to mark the thing and pitied the"
8695,((LACUNA)),"Frogs as they were perishing. He shook his head, and uttered this word:"
8696,((LACUNA)),
8697,((LACUNA)),"(ll. 272-276) 'Dear, dear, how fearful a deed do my eyes behold!"
8698,((LACUNA)),Slice-snatcher makes no small panic rushing to and fro among the Frogs
8699,((LACUNA)),by the lake. Let us then make all haste and send warlike Pallas or even
8700,((LACUNA)),"Ares, for they will stop his fighting, strong though he is.'"
8701,((LACUNA)),
8702,((LACUNA)),(ll. 277-284) So said the Son of Cronos; but Hera answered him: 'Son of
8703,((LACUNA)),"Cronos, neither the might of Athena nor of Ares can avail to deliver"
8704,((LACUNA)),"the Frogs from utter destruction. Rather, come and let us all go to"
8705,((LACUNA)),"help them, or else let loose your weapon, the great and formidable"
8706,((LACUNA)),"Titan-killer with which you killed Capaneus, that doughty man, and great"
8707,((LACUNA)),"Enceladus and the wild tribes of Giants; ay, let it loose, for so the"
8708,((LACUNA)),most valiant will be slain.'
8709,((LACUNA)),
8710,((LACUNA)),(ll. 285-293) So said Hera: and the Son of Cronos cast a lurid
8711,((LACUNA)),"thunderbolt: first he thundered and made great Olympus shake, and the"
8712,((LACUNA)),"cast the thunderbolt, the awful weapon of Zeus, tossing it lightly"
8713,((LACUNA)),"forth. Thus he frightened them all, Frogs and Mice alike, hurling his"
8714,((LACUNA)),"bolt upon them. Yet even so the army of the Mice did not relax, but"
8715,((LACUNA)),"hoped still more to destroy the brood of warrior Frogs. Only, the Son"
8716,((LACUNA)),"of Cronos, on Olympus, pitied the Frogs and then straightway sent them"
8717,((LACUNA)),helpers.
8718,((LACUNA)),
8719,((LACUNA)),(ll. 294-303) So there came suddenly warriors with mailed backs and
8720,((LACUNA)),"curving claws, crooked beasts that walked sideways, nut-cracker-jawed,"
8721,((LACUNA)),"shell-hided: bony they were, flat-backed, with glistening shoulders and"
8722,((LACUNA)),bandy legs and stretching arms and eyes that looked behind them. They
8723,((LACUNA)),had also eight legs and two feelers--persistent creatures who are called
8724,((LACUNA)),crabs. These nipped off the tails and paws and feet of the Mice with
8725,((LACUNA)),"their jaws, while spears only beat on them. Of these the Mice were all"
8726,((LACUNA)),"afraid and no longer stood up to them, but turned and fled. Already the"
8727,((LACUNA)),"sun was set, and so came the end of the one-day war."

8741,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST","for Homer, you might almost say that every city with its inhabitants"
8742,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST",claims him as her son. Foremost are the men of Smyrna who say that he

8744,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST","that he was at first called Melesigenes. He was named Homer later, when"

8768,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST",said by the Pythia concerning Homer in the time of the most sacred
8769,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST","Emperor Hadrian. When the monarch inquired from what city Homer came,"
8770,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST","and whose son he was, the priestess delivered a response in hexameters"
8771,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST",after this fashion:

8773,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST",'Do you ask me of the obscure race and country of the heavenly siren?

8777,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST",answerer being who they are--especially since the poet has so greatly
8778,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST",glorified his grandfather in his works.
8779,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST",
8780,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST","Now some say that he was earlier than Hesiod, others that he was"
8781,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST","younger and akin to him. They give his descent thus: Apollo and Aethusa,"
8782,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST","daughter of Poseidon, had a son Linus, to whom was born Pierus. From"
8783,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST",Pierus and the nymph Methone sprang Oeager; and from Oeager and Calliope
8784,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST","Orpheus; from Orpheus, Dres; and from him, Eucles. The descent is"
8785,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST","continued through Iadmonides, Philoterpes, Euphemus, Epiphrades and"
8786,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST","Melanopus who had sons Dius and Apelles. Dius by Pycimede, the daughter"

8791,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST","a contest of skill at Chalcis in Euboea. For, they say, after Homer had"
8792,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST","composed the ""Margites"", he went about from city to city as a minstrel,"
8793,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST","and coming to Delphi, inquired who he was and of what country? The"
8794,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST",Pythia answered:

8796,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST",'The Isle of Ios is your mother's country and it shall receive you dead;

8798,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST",
8799,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST","Hearing this, it is said, he hesitated to go to Ios, and remained in the"
8800,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST",region where he was. Now about the same time Ganyctor was celebrating
8801,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST","the funeral rites of his father Amphidamas, king of Euboea, and invited"
8802,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST",to the gathering not only all those who were famous for bodily strength
8803,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST","and fleetness of foot, but also those who excelled in wit, promising"
8804,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST","them great rewards. And so, as the story goes, the two went to Chalcis"
8805,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST",and met by chance. The leading Chalcidians were judges together with
8806,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST","Paneides, the brother of the dead king; and it is said that after a"
8807,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST","wonderful contest between the two poets, Hesiod won in the following"
8808,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST",manner: he came forward into the midst and put Homer one question after
8809,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST","another, which Homer answered. Hesiod, then, began:"
8810,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST",
8811,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST","'Homer, son of Meles, inspired with wisdom from heaven, come, tell me"

8816,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST",
8817,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST",Hesiod then asked again:
8818,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST",
8819,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST","'Come, tell me now this also, godlike Homer: what think you in your"

8821,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST",
8822,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST",Homer answered:
8823,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST",
8824,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST","'When mirth reigns throughout the town, and feasters about the house,"
8825,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST","sitting in order, listen to a minstrel; when the tables beside them are"

8829,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST",
8830,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST","It is said that when Homer had recited these verses, they were so"

8832,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST",at public sacrifices all the guests solemnly recite them before feasts
8833,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST","and libations. Hesiod, however, was annoyed by Homer's felicity and"
8834,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST",hurried on to pose him with hard questions. He therefore began with the
8835,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST",following lines:

8837,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST","'Come, Muse; sing not to me of things that are, or that shall be, or"

8839,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST",
8840,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST","Then Homer, wishing to escape from the impasse by an apt answer,"
8841,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST",replied:--

8843,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST","'Never shall horses with clattering hoofs break chariots, striving for"

8846,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST","Here again Homer had fairly met Hesiod, and so the latter turned to"
8847,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST",sentences of doubtful meaning [3702]: he recited many lines and required
8848,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST",Homer to complete the sense of each appropriately. The first of the
8849,"OF THE ORIGIN OF HOMER AND HESIOD, AND OF THEIR CONTEST",following verses is Hesiod's and the next Homer's: but sometimes Hesiod
