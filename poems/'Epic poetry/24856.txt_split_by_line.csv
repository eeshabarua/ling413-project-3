213,INTRODUCTION,INTRODUCTION
214,INTRODUCTION,
215,INTRODUCTION,
216,INTRODUCTION,It has long been the opinion of many of the more progressive teachers
217,INTRODUCTION,"of the United States that, next to Herakles, Odysseus is the hero"
218,INTRODUCTION,"closest to child-life, and that the stories from the ""Odyssey"" are"
219,INTRODUCTION,the most suitable for reading-lessons. These conclusions have been
220,INTRODUCTION,reached through independent experiments not related to educational
221,INTRODUCTION,work in foreign countries.
222,INTRODUCTION,
223,INTRODUCTION,While sojourning in Athens I had the pleasure of visiting the best
224,INTRODUCTION,"schools, both public and private, and found the reading especially"
225,INTRODUCTION,spirited. I examined the books in use and found the regular
226,INTRODUCTION,"reading-books to consist of the classic tales of the country, the"
227,INTRODUCTION,"stories of Herakles, Theseus, Perseus, and so forth, in the reader"
228,INTRODUCTION,"succeeding the primer, and the stories of Odysseus, or Ulysses, as"
229,INTRODUCTION,"we commonly call him, following as a third book, answering to our"
230,INTRODUCTION,second or third reader. This book I brought home with me and had a
231,INTRODUCTION,"careful, literal translation made. I submitted this translation to"
232,INTRODUCTION,"that notable scholar, Zenaïde A. Ragozin, with whom I faithfully"
233,INTRODUCTION,"traversed the ground, word by word and sentence by sentence. This"
234,INTRODUCTION,"version I have carefully compared with Bryant and rewritten, making"
235,INTRODUCTION,the language as simple as could be consistent with the dignity of
236,INTRODUCTION,the subject-matter.
237,INTRODUCTION,
238,INTRODUCTION,The introduction to the original book as I found it in Greece contains
239,INTRODUCTION,"many interesting points, since it shows that educators in foreign"
240,INTRODUCTION,"countries, notably in Germany, had come to the same conclusion with"
241,INTRODUCTION,our best American teachers. The editor of the little Greek
242,INTRODUCTION,reading-book says:
243,INTRODUCTION,
244,INTRODUCTION,"""In editing this work we have made use not only of Homer's 'Odyssey,'"
245,INTRODUCTION,_but also of that excellent reader which is used in the public schools
246,INTRODUCTION,"of Germany_, Willman's 'Lesebuch aus Homer.' We have divided the"
247,INTRODUCTION,"little volume into three parts, the first of which gives a short"
248,INTRODUCTION,"_resumé_ of the war against Troy and the destruction of that city,"
249,INTRODUCTION,"the second the wanderings of Odysseus till his arrival in Ithaca,"
250,INTRODUCTION,the third his arrival and the killing of the wooers. We have no apology
251,INTRODUCTION,"to make in presenting this book to the public as a school-book, since"
252,INTRODUCTION,many people superior to us have shown the need of such books in
253,INTRODUCTION,"school-work. The new public schools, as is well known, have a mission"
254,INTRODUCTION,"of the highest importance. They do not aim, as formerly, at absolute"
255,INTRODUCTION,knowledge pounded into the heads of children in a mechanical way.
256,INTRODUCTION,Their aim is the mental and ethical development of the pupils. Reading
257,INTRODUCTION,and writing lead but half way to this goal. With all nations the
258,INTRODUCTION,readers used in the public schools are a collection of the noblest
259,INTRODUCTION,"thoughts of their authors."""
260,INTRODUCTION,
261,INTRODUCTION,The Greek editor had never read the inane rat and cat stories of
262,INTRODUCTION,"American school ""readers"" when he wrote that. He continues:"
263,INTRODUCTION,
264,INTRODUCTION,"""Happily the Greek nation, more than any other, abounds in literary"
265,INTRODUCTION,masterpieces. Nearly all of the Greek writings contain an abundance
266,INTRODUCTION,of practical wisdom and virtue. Their worth is so great that even
267,INTRODUCTION,the most advanced European nations do not hesitate to introduce them
268,INTRODUCTION,"into their schools. The Germans do this, although their habits and"
269,INTRODUCTION,customs are so different from ours. They especially admire Homer's
270,INTRODUCTION,"works. These books, above all others, afford pleasure to the young,"
271,INTRODUCTION,and the reason for it is clearly set forth by the eminent educator
272,INTRODUCTION,Herbart:
273,INTRODUCTION,
274,INTRODUCTION,"""'The little boy is grieved when told that he is little. Nor does"
275,INTRODUCTION,he enjoy the stories of little children. This is because his
276,INTRODUCTION,imagination reaches out and beyond his environments. I find the
277,INTRODUCTION,stories from Homer to be more suitable reading for young children
278,INTRODUCTION,"than the mass of juvenile books, because they contain grand truths.'"
279,INTRODUCTION,
280,INTRODUCTION,"""Therefore these stories are held in as high esteem by the German"
281,INTRODUCTION,children as by the Greek. In no other works do children find the grand
282,INTRODUCTION,and noble traits in human life so faithfully and charmingly depicted
283,INTRODUCTION,"as in Homer. Here all the domestic, civic, and religious virtues of"
284,INTRODUCTION,the people are marvellously brought to light and the national feeling
285,INTRODUCTION,"is exalted. The Homeric poetry, and especially the 'Odyssey,' is"
286,INTRODUCTION,"adapted to very young children, not only because it satisfies so well"
287,INTRODUCTION,"the needs which lead to mental development, but also for another"
288,INTRODUCTION,reason. As with the people of olden times bravery was considered the
289,INTRODUCTION,"greatest virtue, so with boys of this age and all ages. No other"
290,INTRODUCTION,ethical idea has such predominance as that of prowess. Strength of
291,INTRODUCTION,body and a firm will characterize those whom boys choose as their
292,INTRODUCTION,leaders. Hence the pleasure they derive from the accounts of
293,INTRODUCTION,"celebrated heroes of yore whose bravery, courage, and prudence they"
294,INTRODUCTION,"admire."""
295,INTRODUCTION,
296,INTRODUCTION,The editor further extols the advantages arising from the study of
297,INTRODUCTION,"Homer, it making the youthful students acquainted with the earliest"
298,INTRODUCTION,"periods of Greek history, the manners and customs of the people, and"
299,INTRODUCTION,he ends by quoting from Herbart:
300,INTRODUCTION,
301,INTRODUCTION,"""Boys must first get acquainted with the noisy market-place of Ithaca"
302,INTRODUCTION,"and then be led to the Athens of Miltiades and Themistokles."""
303,INTRODUCTION,
304,INTRODUCTION,With equal truth the American can say that the child whose patriotism
305,INTRODUCTION,is kindled by the Homeric fire will the more gladly respond to the
306,INTRODUCTION,ideals set forth in the history of a Columbus or a Washington.

409,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,
410,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"More than that, having heard the news from Crete that his presence"
411,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"there was desirable on account of some urgent business, he did not"
412,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"hesitate to set sail for that island, in the expectation of finding"
413,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,Paris and his companions still enjoying the hospitality of his palace
414,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,after a short absence.
415,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,
416,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,This was the chance which wily Aphrodite had contrived for Paris.
417,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"He took the hint and carried Helen away to his ship, together with"
418,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"as much treasure as they could lay hands on, and then they sailed"
419,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"for Troy. Little did he heed, in his mad desire to call the most"
420,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"beautiful woman in the world his wife, that she was already the wife"
421,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"of a hero who had received him as an honored guest in his house, and"
422,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,that he was about to destroy the peace and honor of his host.
423,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,
424,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"As soon as Menelaos heard of the flight of his wife, he hastened back"
425,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"to Sparta, where he found his palace deserted and his treasure-house"
426,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,robbed.
427,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,
428,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,Then his heart was filled with great wrath. He set out at once to
429,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"see his brother, Agamemnon, to consult with him about what was to"
430,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"be done. Agamemnon was ruler over Mycenæ, and highly respected in"
431,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,all Hellas on account of his power and riches.
432,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,
433,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"After the two brothers had talked over this grave affair, they"
434,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"announced to all the leaders in Hellas the great and detestable crime,"
435,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,and asked them for their assistance. All the king's chiefs of Hellas
436,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"lent a willing ear to this demand, for in this breach of hospitality,"
437,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"committed against one of them, each felt himself personally aggrieved"
438,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"and bound to help in the punishment of what, in those times, was"
439,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,considered the most unpardonable of all crimes. Only one of the kings
440,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,held back for awhile and needed much persuasion to join the league.
441,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"This was Odysseus of Ithaca, who could well consider himself at the"
442,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"time the happiest of mortals, for he had lately married Penelope,"
443,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,one of the fairest and most virtuous maidens of Greece. He had an
444,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"infant son of great beauty and promise, and he owned much land and"
445,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"countless herds of cattle, sheep, and swine. Added to that, all the"
446,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,petty nobles of the island acknowledged him as their chief.
447,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,
448,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"But a soothsayer, or seer, had greatly disturbed him by informing"
449,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,him that if he went to a great war he would be kept away from his
450,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"home for the space of twenty years, and even then return to it in"
451,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"the guise of a beggar, after having suffered wrecks, captivity,"
452,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"endless wanderings, and loss of comrades."
453,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,
454,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"No one could doubt that Odysseus was brave, but no one could blame"
455,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,him for wishing to be excused from taking part in the war against
456,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"Troy. Menelaos and his brother, however, would accept no excuse from"
457,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"him, as he was the wisest and craftiest of all the leaders, and when"
458,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,Odysseus finally consented to join them he set about arming and
459,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,directing the young Greek warriors with all his heart and soul.
460,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,
461,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,There was another young prince whom it was absolutely necessary to
462,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"secure, for a much venerated oracle had given it as a decree of the"
463,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"gods that Troy could never be taken without his help. This was Achilles,"
464,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"son of Peleus, king of the Myrmidons in Thessaly, and of the beauteous"
465,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"ocean nymph, Thetis. Notwithstanding his extreme youth, his father"
466,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"would not disappoint the whole country, and he let him go with those"
467,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"who came for him. But he sent along with him his adopted son, Patroklos,"
468,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"who was several years older, and to whom the boy was passionately"
469,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"attached, and also his oldest and most trusted servant, Phœnix. These"
470,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"two, the old man and the youth, he charged, as they hoped for the"
471,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"mercy of Zeus, to keep watchful guard over Achilles, whose exceedingly"
472,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,impetuous and reckless temper exposed him to many dangers which might
473,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,be averted by a sensible and loving word spoken in time.

475,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,[Illustration: THE SILVER-FOOTED THETIS RISING FROM THE WAVES]
476,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,
477,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"The Greeks took counsel together, and it was resolved that Menelaos"
478,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"should go in person to Troy and demand back his wife, Helen, as well"
479,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,as his treasure and a suitable apology for the wrong done to him and
480,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,to all Hellas. He chose for his companion the cunning Odysseus. On
481,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"their arrival in Troy, Menelaos and Odysseus presented themselves"
482,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,before Priam and demanded the return of Helen and the treasures.
483,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,
484,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,The king at once called his people together to deliberate upon the
485,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"matter, and the two Greek kings bravely denounced the mean act of"
486,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,"Paris. But the Trojans, stirred up by that youth, abused the"
487,THE FLIGHT OF HELEN,ambassadors and drove them out of their city.

496,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,"The kings and chieftains of Hellas, having heard that Odysseus and"
497,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,"Menelaos had been driven out of Troy, hastened to call together their"
498,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,"fleets and armies at Aulis, a city of Bœotia on a ridge of rock running"
499,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,"out into the sea between two little bays, each of which was a harbor"
500,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,for many ships. A hundred thousand men and a thousand ships were
501,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,gathered there under the leadership of the celebrated and heroic
502,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,chiefs. The commander-in-chief of the whole army was Agamemnon.
503,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,
504,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,"Among the renowned leaders were Menelaos, the sagacious Odysseus,"
505,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,"Ajax, and many others. Just as they were offering a sacrifice to the"
506,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,"gods, in order to start out to the war with their good will, a great"
507,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,miracle happened. A fearful snake crept from under the altar and
508,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,climbed a tree in which there was a sparrow's nest nearly hidden by
509,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,"the leaves. There were eight young sparrows in the nest, nine birds"
510,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,"with the mother. The snake devoured the fluttering little birds,"
511,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,around which the mother circled as if overcome by grief.
512,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,
513,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,"Then the snake darted at the mother-bird and swallowed it, when Zeus"
514,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,"changed the reptile into a stone. The Greeks wondered at the sight,"
515,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,"but the soothsayer, Calchas, said to them: ""Why do ye wonder at this?"
516,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,The all-powerful Zeus has sent us this sign because our deeds shall
517,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,live forever in the minds of men. Just as the snake has devoured the
518,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,"eight little sparrows and their mother, so shall the war swallow up"
519,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,"the nine coming years, and in the tenth we shall overcome Troy."""
520,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,
521,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,The ships of the Greeks lay in the bays of Aulis while the warriors
522,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,waited impatiently to set sail. But the winds were contrary; they
523,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,"would not blow, and the boats waited there year after year; for a"
524,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,"sacred hind had been slain by Agamemnon, one that belonged to the"
525,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,"goddess Artemis, and it was ordered by that goddess that no wind should"
526,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,arise to take them on toward Troy until her wrath had been appeased.
527,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,
528,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,"So Agamemnon went to Calchas, the seer, and asked his advice,"
529,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,whereupon the old prophet told him to send for his lovely young
530,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,"daughter, Iphigeneia, and offer her up on the altar as the only"
531,THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY,acceptable sacrifice to Artemis. When he had placed her upon the altar

557,THE FALL OF TROY,
558,THE FALL OF TROY,"The war lasted nine years, and in the tenth the Greeks conquered Troy,"
559,THE FALL OF TROY,"not in battle, but by means of a trick which had come into the mind"
560,THE FALL OF TROY,of Odysseus. He told a skilful carpenter to build a wooden horse of
561,THE FALL OF TROY,"gigantic size, and in it he hid the bravest Greek warriors. When he"
562,THE FALL OF TROY,had done this he advised all the other Greeks to depart without leaving
563,THE FALL OF TROY,"anything behind them, and so lead the Trojans to believe that they"
564,THE FALL OF TROY,had given up the fight and gone home.
565,THE FALL OF TROY,
566,THE FALL OF TROY,"So the Greeks burned their tents and put off to sea, while the Trojans"
567,THE FALL OF TROY,"from their walls watched them with great joy, thinking themselves"
568,THE FALL OF TROY,"well rid of an enemy. When the last ship had gone, the Trojans threw"
569,THE FALL OF TROY,open the gates of their city and rushed down into the plain where
570,THE FALL OF TROY,"the Greeks had had their camp, to see how the place looked."
571,THE FALL OF TROY,
572,THE FALL OF TROY,"There they found the wooden horse, and one of the Greeks tied to a"
573,THE FALL OF TROY,"tree, who told them he was left there as a punishment, and that the"
574,THE FALL OF TROY,wooden horse was an offering to the gods. The Trojans made up their
575,THE FALL OF TROY,minds to carry it into their city and give it the best place on their
576,THE FALL OF TROY,highest hill.
577,THE FALL OF TROY,
578,THE FALL OF TROY,"Then Laocoön, a priest of Apollo, stepped forth, and said to them:"
579,THE FALL OF TROY,"""Unhappy people! what madness possesses you? Do ye think the enemy"
580,THE FALL OF TROY,gone? Do ye know Odysseus so little? There are Greek warriors hidden
581,THE FALL OF TROY,"in this horse, or else some other mischief is lurking there. Fear"
582,THE FALL OF TROY,"the Greeks even when they bring gifts."""
583,THE FALL OF TROY,
584,THE FALL OF TROY,"With these words, he thrust his spear into the flank of the horse,"
585,THE FALL OF TROY,and the arms of the hidden enemy clashed with a loud noise. Just then
586,THE FALL OF TROY,"two snakes of great size, sent by Athena, rose from the sea, and sprang"
587,THE FALL OF TROY,"upon Laocoön and his two sons, and, coiling around them, bit them"
588,THE FALL OF TROY,"to death. The Trojans, in great fear at the sight, took this as a"
589,THE FALL OF TROY,sign from the gods that the horse was sacred and that they must protect
590,THE FALL OF TROY,"it, and they moved it at once into their city, breaking down a part"
591,THE FALL OF TROY,of their wall to get it in.
592,THE FALL OF TROY,
593,THE FALL OF TROY,"Having done this, they gave themselves up to feasting and making merry,"
594,THE FALL OF TROY,without the slightest thought that any evil was in store for them.
595,THE FALL OF TROY,"But when night had come, and all were in a deep sleep, the ships of"
596,THE FALL OF TROY,"the Greeks, which had been hiding all the while behind a neighboring"
597,THE FALL OF TROY,"island, came back. The warriors who were concealed in the wooden horse"
598,THE FALL OF TROY,"sprang out and rushing wildly through the city, slew the Trojans right"
599,THE FALL OF TROY,"and left without mercy. From all sides came wailings and groans, and"
600,THE FALL OF TROY,the flames of the burning city rose up to the sky.
601,THE FALL OF TROY,
602,THE FALL OF TROY,A deadly struggle took place between the Trojans and the Greeks. Priam
603,THE FALL OF TROY,"was slain, and Paris and many other heroes. The victory was to the"
604,THE FALL OF TROY,"Greeks. Troy fell never to rise again, and the women and children"
605,THE FALL OF TROY,were led off to become slaves to their conquerors.
606,THE FALL OF TROY,
607,THE FALL OF TROY,"Thus was destroyed in one night the great and glorious city of Troy,"
608,THE FALL OF TROY,all on account of the crime which Paris had committed against the
609,THE FALL OF TROY,laws of hospitality.
610,THE FALL OF TROY,
611,THE FALL OF TROY,The trials of the Greeks were not yet at an end. After their victory
612,THE FALL OF TROY,at Troy they embarked in their ships and started eagerly for their
613,THE FALL OF TROY,"homes. But Zeus prepared a sad fate for them, because Ajax had"
614,THE FALL OF TROY,"violently dragged Cassandra, the beautiful daughter of Priam, from"
615,THE FALL OF TROY,the altar of Athena and had made her his slave. Thus many of the leaders
616,THE FALL OF TROY,"perished in the sea far from home, and some were cast on foreign shores"
617,THE FALL OF TROY,to die.
618,THE FALL OF TROY,
619,THE FALL OF TROY,"Menelaos was thrown by wind and waves on the island of Crete, and"
620,THE FALL OF TROY,he lost many of the ships on the cliffs. Thence he strayed to the

622,THE FALL OF TROY,"lands until he came to Egypt, where he wandered about for eight years,"
623,THE FALL OF TROY,"when he returned to Sparta, taking Helen with him. He became"

664,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,unfortunate Odysseus was delayed by the fair nymph Calypso on her
665,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,"island, where she made her home in a cool and beautiful grotto. There"
666,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,"he wept and mourned, desiring to see his wife again and his native"
667,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,"land. Each of the gods save one, Poseidon, god of the sea, wished"
668,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,to help him to find the way home. Odysseus had brought Poseidon's
669,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,wrath upon himself through inflicting a terrible injury upon the
670,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,"favorite son of that deity, and for that reason the wrath of the god"
671,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,fell on him and he was wrecked. One day all the other gods had assembled
672,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,"in the hall of Zeus, on Mount Olympos, when Athena, the favorite"
673,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,"daughter of Zeus and firm friend of Odysseus, knowing that her father"
674,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,"in his heart was well-disposed toward the hero, began to plead for"
675,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,him in a way to excite greater pity still.
676,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,
677,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,"""O my father, thou great king among the gods,"" she said, ""my heart"
678,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,"is troubled on account of the wise Odysseus, who lingers on an island,"
679,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,"far away from home, and suffers greatly; for a nymph lives on the"
680,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,"island, the daughter of great Atlas, and with sweet words she strives"
681,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,to make Odysseus forget his native land. But he bewails his fate and
682,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,"is full of sorrow, his only wish being to have a glimpse of the smoke"
683,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,"of his beloved country."""
684,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,
685,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,Zeus thereupon ordered Hermes to depart at once for the island and
686,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,tell the nymph to send Odysseus to his home without delay. Hermes
687,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,"obeyed quickly. He bound his winged sandals to his feet, and, taking"
688,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,"his golden wand in his hand, flew like a meteor over land and sea"
689,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,till he reached the island where the nymph Calypso made her abode.
690,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,"He found her within the grotto, singing sweetly while she wove a fine"

692,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,
693,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,All about the grotto there was a grove of cypress-trees in which birds
694,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,"of gay colors were sporting and springs of pure water bubbling, and"
695,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,the fragrance of strange flowers filled the air. When Hermes had gazed
696,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,upon these wonders he entered the grotto. It was bright with a blazing
697,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,"fire on a spacious hearth, and fragrant with the odor of burning cedar"
698,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,and cypress.
699,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,
700,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,Calypso saw him as he came in and knew him. She bade him sit down
701,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,"on a throne dazzling with jewels, and, placing a table before him"
702,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,"laden with nectar and ambrosia, invited him to eat and drink. After"
703,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,"he had finished his repast, Hermes told her that Zeus had sent him"
704,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,to her with the command that she should send Odysseus without delay
705,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,"to his native land. Having given this message, he disappeared, leaving"

707,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,
708,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,Odysseus in the meantime sat by the shore mourning and gazing out
709,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,"upon the sea. Calypso found him there, sitting alone, weeping and"
710,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,"longing for his home. She stood by him and said: ""Odysseus, my unhappy"

718,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,"Thus spoke the lovely goddess, but Odysseus could hardly believe her,"
719,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,"and said: ""I fear, O goddess, that thou hast some other thought in"

731,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO,"Speaking thus, the goddess went into the grotto and Odysseus followed"

751,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,"At daybreak the goddess gave Odysseus a large axe and a sharp adze,"
752,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,"and led him to the heights of the island, where the largest trees"
753,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,"grew. He went to work at once and cut down twenty trees, which he"
754,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,"hewed into proper shape, and then tied them together with ropes which"
755,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,he himself made of bark.
756,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,
757,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,In this way he built a raft which was very large and strong enough
758,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,to stand the onset of the waves. He wove a railing of willow and fitted
759,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,"it around the sides of the raft, to protect himself against the dashing"

762,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,wax and pitch and attached a rudder.

764,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,"At the end of the fourth day his work was all done, and his little"

766,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,prepared the hero a bath and gave him new garments fragrant with
767,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,perfumes. She went down to the boat with him and put on board a skin

771,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,
772,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,Odysseus was wild with joy at the thought that he was really on his
773,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,way home once more. He spread his sails to catch the breeze and took
774,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,"his seat at the helm, steering the vessel with great skill. He did"
775,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,"not dare to take any sleep, for he had to watch the sky and stars"
776,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,constantly and use them as guides on his course. He sailed along in
777,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,this way seventeen days. On the eighteenth he spied land in the
778,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,"distance. It was the land of the Phæacians, lying like a dark spot"
779,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,off in the sea.
780,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,
781,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,"Then Poseidon, who was returning from Ethiopia, saw him, and his wrath"

783,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,"""Alas! the gods have strangely changed their minds about Odysseus"
784,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,during my absence in Africa. Behold! in a little while he will be

786,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,"Nevertheless, it is in my power to chastise him."""
787,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,
788,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,"Speaking thus, Poseidon called the clouds together, and seizing his"

790,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,"there was a general hurricane, and he wrapped heaven and earth in"

792,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,
793,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,"The mighty waves dashed over the raft, and Odysseus sank on his knees"
794,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,"and trembled. With a deep groan he said: ""Ah me, unhappy! Am I to"
795,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,bear more disasters? I fear that the warning of the goddess was too
796,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,"true, and that I shall be for a long time cast about on the waves"
797,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,before I reach home. With what dark clouds Zeus has shrouded the sky!
798,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,The storm grows wild. What terrible waves are these! Helplessly I

804,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,
805,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,As he spoke a huge wave struck the raft with such terrible force that
806,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,it whirled it around and overturned it. The helm was wrung from his
807,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,hand and he fell into the angry breakers. The mast was snapped in
808,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,two and the ropes and sails flew off into the sea.

810,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,"Odysseus was under water a long time, striving in vain to come to"

812,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,"mouth. Although he was in such a desperate plight, his mind was on"
813,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,"the raft. Battling bravely with the waves he reached it, and springing"
814,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,on board sat down in the middle of it. Thus he escaped death.
815,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,
816,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,The angry waves tossed him hither and thither as the wind scatters
817,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,"the leaves over a field. Then Ino, the daughter of Cadmus, saw him"
818,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,"and took pity on him. She took the form of a bird, and, perching on"
819,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,"his raft, she said to him: ""O, luckless man! why is Poseidon so angry"
820,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,"with thee? Fear nothing, however; he cannot take thy life. Obey me"
821,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,"and thou shalt not suffer much longer. Lay aside thy clothes, leave"
822,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,"the raft to the mercy of the winds and waves, and swim to the land."
823,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,"Take my veil and wind it about thy breast, and thou shalt not have"

826,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,
827,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,"Odysseus hesitated to follow Ino's advice, fearing some treachery."
828,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,But Poseidon sent a huge wave which struck him and scattered the raft
829,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,as if it were dry chaff. Then Odysseus at once got astride of the
830,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,swimming timber. He bound the veil around his breast and bravely
831,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,plunged into the boiling waters.
832,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,
833,ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND,"Poseidon saw him, and shaking his head he said: ""I verily believe"

1199,ODYSSEUS IN THE HALLS OF ALKINOÖS,"Odysseus, ""for she bade me come with her maids, but I lingered in"
1200,ODYSSEUS IN THE HALLS OF ALKINOÖS,"a grove to offer a prayer to Athena."" When Alkinoös had heard this"
1201,ODYSSEUS IN THE HALLS OF ALKINOÖS,"tale from Odysseus, he promised once more to give him a ship and"
1202,ODYSSEUS IN THE HALLS OF ALKINOÖS,sailors to escort him home.
1203,ODYSSEUS IN THE HALLS OF ALKINOÖS,
1204,ODYSSEUS IN THE HALLS OF ALKINOÖS,Meanwhile the queen bade her servants prepare a bed for the hero out
1205,ODYSSEUS IN THE HALLS OF ALKINOÖS,"on the portico, and they covered a couch with shaggy rugs and purple"
1206,ODYSSEUS IN THE HALLS OF ALKINOÖS,"tapestries, where he could rest. With a grateful heart Odysseus arose,"
1207,ODYSSEUS IN THE HALLS OF ALKINOÖS,"and, thanking the king for his generous hospitality, sought the bed,"
1208,ODYSSEUS IN THE HALLS OF ALKINOÖS,where he gave himself to happy dreams.
1209,ODYSSEUS IN THE HALLS OF ALKINOÖS,
1210,ODYSSEUS IN THE HALLS OF ALKINOÖS,Odysseus rose early the next morning and went with Alkinoös to the
1211,ODYSSEUS IN THE HALLS OF ALKINOÖS,"market-place, close to the sea, where all the Phæacians had assembled."
1212,ODYSSEUS IN THE HALLS OF ALKINOÖS,"The people gazed with admiration at their stranger-guest, for Athena"
1213,ODYSSEUS IN THE HALLS OF ALKINOÖS,"lent him greater dignity and beauty, and she went among the crowds,"
1214,ODYSSEUS IN THE HALLS OF ALKINOÖS,moving their hearts to sympathy with him.
1215,ODYSSEUS IN THE HALLS OF ALKINOÖS,
1216,ODYSSEUS IN THE HALLS OF ALKINOÖS,"Alkinoös then addressed the assembled multitude: ""Hear me, ye chiefs"
1217,ODYSSEUS IN THE HALLS OF ALKINOÖS,"of the Phæacians,"" he said. ""This stranger has come to our land after"
1218,ODYSSEUS IN THE HALLS OF ALKINOÖS,many wanderings and adventures. And he asks me to send him back to
1219,ODYSSEUS IN THE HALLS OF ALKINOÖS,his own country. Let us fit out a ship for him quickly and launch
1220,ODYSSEUS IN THE HALLS OF ALKINOÖS,"it, and give him fifty-two young men from among our best sailors,"
1221,ODYSSEUS IN THE HALLS OF ALKINOÖS,who shall get everything ready for the long journey.

1227,ODYSSEUS IN THE HALLS OF ALKINOÖS,
1228,ODYSSEUS IN THE HALLS OF ALKINOÖS,"Having spoken, Alkinoös rose and led his guest back to the palace,"
1229,ODYSSEUS IN THE HALLS OF ALKINOÖS,the princes following him. Fifty-two youths were soon chosen from
1230,ODYSSEUS IN THE HALLS OF ALKINOÖS,"among the best seamen, and they launched a ship speedily and went"

1239,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,
1240,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,Alkinoös now ordered a sumptuous feast in honor of his guest. When
1241,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"the table was spread, the herald who had gone for Demodokos came in"
1242,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"leading the bard, who was blind. The gods had deprived him of sight,"
1243,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,but had bestowed upon him the gift of song. They gave him a seat on
1244,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"a silver throne, amid the guests, and hung his harp against a lofty"
1245,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"pillar, close above his head, where he could easily reach it."
1246,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,
1247,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"When all had eaten and drunk as much as they desired, Demodokos took"
1248,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,his lyre and began to sing about the heroes of Troy. It was a song
1249,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"whose fame had reached over the whole world, the story of a friendly"
1250,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"strife between Achilles and Odysseus before Troy, in which Achilles"
1251,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"held that Troy would fall by force, but Odysseus maintained that it"
1252,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,would come to an end through the cunning of a few brave Greeks.
1253,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,
1254,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"All the guests enjoyed listening to the thrilling song, but Odysseus"
1255,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"was deeply touched, and tears fell from his eyes. He brushed them"
1256,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"away stealthily, so that no one should observe them, and drew a large"
1257,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"purple veil over his face until the song was finished, when he put"
1258,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"it away and took a goblet of wine, which he poured out on the ground"
1259,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,as a libation to the gods.
1260,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,
1261,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"Again the minstrel took his harp and sang, and again Odysseus wept."
1262,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"Alkinoös noticed that the song of Demodokos moved Odysseus to tears,"
1263,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,and thought it might be well to stay the music awhile and begin the
1264,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"games, that the stranger might witness the athletic skill of the"
1265,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,Phæacians. All the princes instantly arose and walked down to the
1266,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"market-place, the king leading and the people following."
1267,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,
1268,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,When the chiefs had taken their seats a great number of young men
1269,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,hastened forward to begin the games. Some of them darted over the
1270,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"plain in a foot-race, raising a cloud of dust. Others strove with"
1271,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"all their might in wrestling-matches, while some threw the quoit or"
1272,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,played at boxing and leaping. After they had enjoyed looking at the
1273,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"games, Laodamas, a son of Alkinoös, said to his friends: ""Let us ask"
1274,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,the stranger to take part in the games. His strong arms and legs and
1275,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,powerful neck show that he is no weakling. Nor has he lost his youthful
1276,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"vigor after all his hardships, although nothing tires a man so much"
1277,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"as being tossed about on the sea."""
1278,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,
1279,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,Then the friends of Laodamas advised him to challenge Odysseus to
1280,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"take part in the games; and this seemed right to the prince, so he"
1281,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"said to him: ""Father, I think thou must be skilful in these games."
1282,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,Let us see thee try them. We will not delay thee long. Thy ship is
1283,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"ready for thee on the sea, and the crew is there, waiting. But there"
1284,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,is no greater glory or pleasure for a man than to excel in swiftness
1285,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"of foot and strength of muscle."""
1286,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,
1287,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"Odysseus answered him: ""Why dost thou urge me, O Laodamas? How can"
1288,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,I take part in the games or find any pleasure in them after all that
1289,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"I have suffered? Here I sit, a suppliant, praying to be sent back"
1290,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"to my wife and home."" Then Euryalos scoffed at him, saying: ""Thou"
1291,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"art right, stranger, for thy countenance shows thou art anything but"
1292,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,an athlete.
1293,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,
1294,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"""Methinks thou art the owner of some merchant-vessel. Thou art a"
1295,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"trader, whose head is full of bargains. Such men can take heed of"
1296,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"nothing except how to increase wealth."""
1297,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,
1298,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"These mocking words vexed Odysseus, and he retorted: ""My friend, thou"
1299,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,dost not speak like a man of good mind. The gods do not bestow their
1300,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"gifts equally on all men. To thee they have given great beauty, but"
1301,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"they have denied thee wit. Thy words carry no weight. Learn, then,"
1302,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,that I am not unskilled in the games. When I was young and strong
1303,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"I was one of the best athletes. But even now, after all my shipwrecks"
1304,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"and hardships, I will strive with thee, for thy words are offensive"
1305,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"and challenge me to the proof."""
1306,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,
1307,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"Having said this, Odysseus seized a much larger and heavier quoit"
1308,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"than the Phæacian prince could use, and swinging it in his powerful"
1309,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,hand he hurled it forth. The stone whirred through the air and fell
1310,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,to the ground away beyond the marks of the other disks. Then Athena
1311,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"took the form of a Phæacian and set a mark where the quoit fell, and"
1312,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"exclaimed as she did so: ""Stranger, even a blind man could easily"
1313,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"find thy mark, for it is far beyond the others. Sit down in peace"
1314,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"and do not fear that anybody else can throw so far."" Odysseus was"
1315,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,pleased when he heard these friendly words. With a light heart he
1316,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"said to the Phæacian youths: ""Reach my mark, if you can, young men,"
1317,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"and I will send a stone farther yet. But if you cannot reach it, and"
1318,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"prefer a match at boxing or wrestling or foot-race, come forth. I"
1319,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,am ready to try any of the games with you. I can throw a spear farther
1320,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,than any of you can shoot an arrow. I fear nothing unless it may be
1321,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"the foot-race, for I have lost my strength with want of food and being"
1322,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"tossed by the waves."""
1323,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,
1324,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"He ended, and King Alkinoös stepped forward, for the young men were"
1325,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"all silent. ""Stranger,"" he said, ""thou art our dearly loved guest,"
1326,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,and no one can doubt thy bravery. We do not boast that we are fine
1327,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,boxers or wrestlers. We excel in the dance and are unsurpassed in
1328,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"sailing ships. Come, then, young men, show your skill in dancing,"
1329,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,that our guest may tell his people when he reaches his home how much
1330,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,we outdo all others in that art. And let a herald hasten to the palace
1331,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"and bring the lyre of Demodokos, which has been left there."""
1332,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,
1333,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,The young men arranged themselves in two rows on the polished floors
1334,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"and began the dance, while the minstrel, standing in their midst,"
1335,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,played on the lyre and sang most sweetly. Odysseus looked on and
1336,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,greatly admired the swift and rhythmical movements of their feet.
1337,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,All danced very well; but two of the sons of the king came out and
1338,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"danced alone, for none of the others equalled them. One of them held"
1339,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"a golden ball in his hand, and bending backward threw it so high that"
1340,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,it seemed to touch the clouds. The other sprang up and caught it easily
1341,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,before it touched the ground.
1342,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,
1343,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"They both danced, going through intricate and rhythmical figures,"
1344,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,while the other young men stood around in a circle and clapped their
1345,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"hands, keeping time. Then Odysseus said to Alkinoös: ""Truly, no one"
1346,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,excels the Phæacian princes in dancing. I see the twinkling of their
1347,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"feet with amazement."""
1348,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,
1349,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"These words pleased Alkinoös greatly, and he said to his people:"
1350,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"""Listen, my chiefs, for our guest seems to be a wise man. It becomes"
1351,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,us now to bestow upon him the gifts of hospitality. In this land there
1352,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,are twelve kings. I am the thirteenth. Let each one of us bring a
1353,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"fine cloak, and a tunic, and a talent of gold, that our guest may"
1354,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"see them before he partakes of the evening banquet. And let Euryalos,"
1355,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"who spoke such scoffing words to him, try to win back his friendship"
1356,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"and bring a costly gift."" All the chiefs approved the words of King"
1357,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"Alkinoös, and each one sent a servant to his house to bring a valuable"
1358,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,present.
1359,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,
1360,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,Euryalos cheerfully obeyed the king. He brought a brass sword with
1361,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"a silver hilt to Odysseus, and said: ""My father, if I have uttered"
1362,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"any offensive word to thee, may the winds scatter all remembrance"
1363,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"of it. May the gods grant thee a speedy return to thy country, where"

1366,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,
1367,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"Odysseus answered: ""Hail to thee, also, my friend! May the gods give"
1368,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"thee all that there is good, and may no need of this sword ever come"

1370,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,
1371,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"The sun had set, and the servants carried the gifts to the royal palace,"
1372,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,where the queen took care of them. King Alkinoös led the way to the
1373,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"palace, his guest at his side and the princes following. When they"
1374,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"had taken their seats on high thrones, the king told his wife to lay"
1375,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"the royal presents in a chest, adding a much richer cloak and tunic"
1376,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,than anyone else had given as a gift from himself.
1377,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,
1378,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"Aretè did as her husband wished, and placed a beautiful cup of gold"
1379,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"also in the chest, and led Odysseus up to look at the presents. Then"
1380,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"she taught him how to lock the chest and unlock it, and her maids"
1381,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"called him to a warm bath, after which he anointed himself with"

1383,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,
1384,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"While he was wending his way to the men who sat before their wine,"
1385,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"he met Nausicaä in her goddess-like beauty, standing near a pillar."
1386,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"""Stranger, farewell,"" she said. ""I wish thee joy and a safe return"
1387,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,to thy native land. Do not forget that I was the first to befriend

1389,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,
1390,THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS,"Odysseus answered: ""May the gods be as sure to favor my return to"

1473,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"shore, and thought our trials would soon be at an end. But in this"
1474,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"we were disappointed, for when we were about to round the cape at"
1475,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"the southern point of Greece, we met an evil wind which always blows"
1476,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"there, and it drove us far to the east, beyond the island of Cythera."
1477,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,
1478,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"""Nine days and nine nights we were driven about on the sea by the"
1479,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"violent storm, and on the tenth we reached the land of the Lotus-eaters."
1480,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"These men eat flowers that look like water-lilies, and they have no"
1481,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"other food. We landed on the shore of the mainland, and my comrades"
1482,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,took their evening meal close to the boats.
1483,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,
1484,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"""When our hunger was satisfied, I sent out two of the best men to"
1485,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,explore the country about and find out what sort of people the
1486,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"Lotus-eaters were. I sent a herald with them, whom they might send"
1487,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,back with the news.
1488,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,
1489,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"""They soon found themselves among the Lotus-eaters, who were gentle"
1490,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"and friendly, and gave them the lotus plant to eat. This food is"
1491,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"pleasant to the taste, but dangerous; for anyone who eats of it loses"
1492,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"all desire to return to his own home. He forgets his cares and troubles,"
1493,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,but also his friends.
1494,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,
1495,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"""As soon as my comrades had eaten of the lotus, they became attached"
1496,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"to the Lotus-eaters, and desired to remain with them. They wept"
1497,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"bitterly when I commanded them to return to the ships, and I was"
1498,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,obliged to force them to go.

1500,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"""I bound them down to the benches in the ships, and the whole company"
1501,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,went on board in haste lest they should never think of their homes
1502,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"again. Each man bent to his oars, and the waves were soon white with"
1503,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,the beating of the ships against them as we sailed with all haste
1504,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,in the direction of our own land.
1505,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,
1506,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"""We sailed about on unknown seas and with sorrowing hearts until we"
1507,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,came to the land of the Cyclops. They are a wild people who have no
1508,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"laws. They never plough the fields nor plant them, for everything"
1509,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"grows of its own accord--wheat, and barley, and the vine. The grapes"
1510,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"yield good wine. The Cyclops do not come together in a friendly way,"
1511,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"but live in caves near the mountain tops, each one in his own den."
1512,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"They do not care much for one another, and each rules his wife and"
1513,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,children as he likes.
1514,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,
1515,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"""There is a little woody island lying at the entrance to the land"
1516,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"of the Cyclops, on which swarm numberless wild goats, never disturbed"
1517,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"by human beings, for the Cyclops have no ships to take them over."
1518,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"This island is very fertile, but there are no sheep to eat the grass"
1519,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,and no people to plough the fields. The goats are the only inhabitants.
1520,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"The island has a harbor which is safe, and the ships that enter it"
1521,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,have no need of anchors or fastenings.
1522,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,
1523,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"""In the midst of the harbor there is a cliff, from which bubbles forth"
1524,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"a spring of excellent water, and poplar-trees grow all around it."
1525,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"The soil is so rich it might bear all kinds of fruit, if there were"
1526,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"anyone to plant them. There are beautiful meadows all along the coast,"
1527,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,which are gay with yellow fruit and pink blossoms.
1528,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,
1529,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"""We were shaping our course toward this island, and a good breeze"
1530,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,brought us there on a dark night. The moon did not shine and none
1531,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,of the crew saw the land until we were upon the shore. We lowered
1532,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,our sails and rested there until morning. When daylight appeared we
1533,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,beheld with wonder the island where the wild goats abounded. My
1534,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"comrades walked around, admiring the beauty of the place, while the"
1535,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"nymphs, daughters of Zeus, roused the goats that they might give us"
1536,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"milk. We took our bows and arrows from the ships immediately and,"
1537,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"forming three hunting-parties, killed a great number of the nimble"
1538,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,"creatures. Each of my twelve ships received nine goats as its share,"
1539,THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS,but mine received ten. The remainder of the day we passed in eating

1549,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"""The next day I started with twelve men, the crew of my own ship,"
1550,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"to find out what kind of men inhabited the country opposite us, leaving"
1551,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,all the other boats and their men on the island. When we sailed up
1552,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"to the coast of the mainland, we heard the voices of giants, and the"
1553,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"bleating of their sheep and goats. And we saw a cave with a high roof,"
1554,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"over whose entrance grew laurel shrubs, and many cattle, sheep, and"
1555,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,goats were lying around at rest. We found an enclosure of rough stone
1556,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"in the form of a court, with tall pines and leafy oaks at the mouth"
1557,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,of the cave.
1558,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,
1559,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"""The largest giant of all the race of Cyclops dwelt there and took"
1560,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,care of his cattle all alone. Usually he spent his time prowling all
1561,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,by himself around the mountains. He had nothing to do with his
1562,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"neighbors, but led a solitary life, plotting wicked deeds. He looked"
1563,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"more like a huge mountain top, with shaggy overhanging forests,"
1564,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"towering above other mountains, than a human being."
1565,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,
1566,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"""We were soon inside the cave, but we did not find the owner at home."
1567,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,We had carried with us a wine-skin full of wine which a priest of
1568,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,Apollo had given us. The wine was very fragrant and so pleasant that
1569,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"no one who had once tasted it, could let it alone. We had taken along"
1570,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"a basket of food also, for fear of meeting with men of great strength"
1571,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,and no sense of the courtesy due to strangers.
1572,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,
1573,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"""As we looked around the cave we wondered at what we saw. There were"
1574,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"baskets all about heaped with cheeses, and pens of lambs separated"
1575,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"into three folds, the older in one pen, the younger in another, and"
1576,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"the youngest in a third. And there were pails full of whey, and buckets"
1577,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"of milk. My companions ate as much of the cheese as they liked, after"
1578,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,which they begged to drive all the lambs and kids down to the ship.
1579,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,
1580,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"""But I would not allow this. It was my wish to stay there and see"
1581,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,the cave-dweller and find out what kind of a man he was. I thought
1582,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"he would give me a handsome present, according to the laws of"
1583,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"hospitality. It was cold in the cave, so we lit a fire and sat down"
1584,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,to wait for the owner to arrive.
1585,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,
1586,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"""He came toward evening, carrying a load of wood on his back, which"
1587,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,he threw down with such a crash that my men ran with terror into the
1588,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,corners of the cave. The giant drove all such sheep and goats as would
1589,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"give him milk into the cave, leaving the others in the outside court,"
1590,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,and then closed up the entrance with a rock so large that twenty-four
1591,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"four-wheeled wagons could not have moved it. Having done this, he"
1592,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,sat down and milked the sheep and goats and gave to each its young
1593,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,one.
1594,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,
1595,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"""Next, he curdled half of the milk and put the curd into woven baskets,"
1596,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,but he kept the other half for his evening meal. When he had ended
1597,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"this work he lit a fire, and seeing the strangers he began to ask"
1598,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"them questions, to find out who they were. His voice was deep and"
1599,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"frightful, like the rumbling of a volcano, and our hearts trembled,"
1600,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"but I found words to answer him: 'We are Greeks, and come from Troy."
1601,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"It was our intention to return home, but contrary winds have driven"
1602,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,us on this shore.

1605,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,he has overcome a strong city and conquered many nations. But now
1606,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,we throw ourselves at thy feet and pray that thou wilt receive us
1607,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"as guests, or else give us the gifts that are due to strangers, lest"
1608,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,the gods avenge us.'
1609,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,
1610,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"""Having said this, I stopped, but the Cyclops told us that we were"
1611,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"fools to believe in the gods. 'The Cyclops,' he said, 'care nothing"
1612,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,for the gods. We are better than they are. If I spare thee it will
1613,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"be of my own free will, and not for fear of the gods. But where are"
1614,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,thy ships? Are they near here or far off?' This he said hoping to
1615,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"deceive us, but I saw through his trick, and replied: 'The storm has"
1616,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"thrown our ships upon the cliffs and broken them to pieces, and we"
1617,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,had to swim for our lives.'
1618,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,
1619,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"""The cruel monster did not answer me again, but he seized two of my"
1620,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,companions and dashed them to the ground with such force that they
1621,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,died on the spot. He devoured them as a lion devours his prey. He
1622,THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS,"left nothing of them, neither bones nor flesh nor hair. We wept aloud"

1633,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,the floor of the cave to sleep. Then the thought came to me to thrust
1634,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,"a sword into his heart. But this was not a wise course to take, because"
1635,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,we should never have been able to remove the stone from the entrance
1636,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,to the cave.
1637,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,
1638,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,"""We passed the night in mourning and lamentations. As soon as daylight"
1639,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,"appeared, the Cyclops woke up and lit a fire and milked his sheep"
1640,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,again. Then he seized two more of my companions and devoured them.
1641,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,When his morning meal was done he rolled the stone back from the door
1642,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,"and drove his beasts out, not forgetting to secure the entrance. We"
1643,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,could hear his noisy shouts afar off as he led his flocks over the
1644,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,"grassy heights, and we began to make plans to destroy him."
1645,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,
1646,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,"""We found a great club of green olive-wood in the cave; one that the"
1647,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,Cyclops had cut for his own use. It was as large as the mast of a
1648,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,"ship, and he had laid it away to dry. I cut off a fathom's length"
1649,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,"from this club and handed the piece to my companions, who smoothed"
1650,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,"off its sides and sharpened it at one end. This being done, I put"
1651,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,"the sharp end of it into the fire. The stick became very hard, and"
1652,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,then I hid the weapon under a heap of litter which was piled up in
1653,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,the cave. We cast lots to see who should assist me to put out the
1654,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,eye of the Cyclops when he was asleep.
1655,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,
1656,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,"""When evening came the Cyclops returned to the cave with his fat sheep"
1657,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,"and kids. He seemed to suspect that there was mischief afoot, for"
1658,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,he did not leave any of them outside. After milking the ewes and goats
1659,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,he again seized two of my companions and made his supper of them.
1660,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,But I filled a large drinking-vessel with the wine from our wine-skin
1661,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,and stepped boldly out and said to him: 'Here is a cup of wine which
1662,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,"I brought, hoping that thou wouldst spare my life, O Cyclops, for"
1663,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,thy wrath is boundless.' He took the cup and drank. The wine delighted
1664,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,"him greatly, and he handed me the cup after emptying it and said:"
1665,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,'Give me another draught and tell me thy name. I will give thee a
1666,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,"generous gift, such as becomes a host. We, too, have wine, but not"
1667,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,such as yours. That tastes like nectar and ambrosia.'
1668,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,
1669,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,"""Three times I filled the cup and brought it to him, and three times"
1670,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,the Cyclops drank it like a madman. When the wine had overpowered
1671,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,"him, I said to him: 'Cyclops, thou dost wish to know my name, and"
1672,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,"I will tell it, but thou must give me the present thou hast promised."
1673,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,My name is Nobody. My father and mother gave me this name and my friends
1674,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,"all call me by it.' 'Then,' said the Cyclops, 'I shall eat Nobody"
1675,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,last of all. This is my present.'
1676,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,
1677,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,"""After these words he fell asleep and, being very drunk, he began"
1678,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,to spew out the wine and flesh he had taken. I took the piece of
1679,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,olive-wood which my men had sharpened and put the point of it into
1680,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,the fire and held it there until it was a glowing coal. My comrades
1681,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,stood near me and I encouraged them with brave words. We thrust the
1682,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,burning stick into the Cyclops' eye and put it out. He howled with
1683,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,"pain, and, stung to madness, he seized the stick and flung it across"
1684,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,the cave.
1685,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,

1689,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,"to help him, but they could not get into the cave. They stood near"
1690,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,"the stone, close to the door, and called out: 'What ails thee,"
1691,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,Polyphemus? Is anyone trying to kill thee?' 'Woe is me!' cried
1692,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,"Polyphemus, 'Nobody is trying to kill me.' 'Then why dost thou shout"
1693,THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS,"and cry for help?' said they. 'If nobody hurts thee, then thou art"

2418,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS","about me, so that I struggled in vain. Then all the men plied their"
2419,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS","oars until the water was white with foam, and when we were out of"
2420,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS","sight of the island and could no longer hear the songs of the Sirens,"
2421,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS","my men set me free, and I took the wax from their ears."
2422,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS",
2423,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS","""Hardly had we escaped from the Sirens when we beheld a black fog"
2424,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS",and towering waves and heard a frightful noise. My men were so scared
2425,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS",that the oars fell from their hands and the ship stood still. I
2426,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS","hastened from one end of the boat to the other, speaking cheerful"
2427,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS","words to each rower. 'My dear friends,' I said, 'have no fear. This"
2428,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS",is not the first time we have encountered danger. We have been saved
2429,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS","from the hands of the Cyclops through our own valor and clever devices,"
2430,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS","and we are not going to break down now. Listen, and I will tell you"
2431,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS",what is to be done. Keep your seats and ply your oars with all your
2432,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS","might; but thou, O helmsman, steer thy ship clear of that fog and"
2433,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS","the whirling waves.' Thus I spoke, and they willingly obeyed my words."
2434,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS",
2435,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS","""Yet I said nothing to them about Skylla, lest they should lose heart"
2436,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS",and hide in the bottom of the ship. Thus we passed in between the
2437,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS","two cliffs, the one of which harbored Skylla and the other Charybdis,"
2438,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS","who, with a terrible noise, swallowed the brine of the sea and belched"
2439,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS",it out again with a roar like the mingling of fire and water.
2440,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS",
2441,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS","""But I forgot the command of Circè to fly from these monsters without"
2442,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS","fighting. I put on my shining armor and took a spear in each hand,"
2443,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS","and went on deck, and stood in warlike attitude ready to attack Skylla"
2444,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS",if she should raise a hand to seize one of my men. I looked for a
2445,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS","long time, but I could not see her."
2446,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS",
2447,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS","""We sailed on, the uproar increasing. My men grew white with fear."
2448,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS",The salt waters whirled so that we could look into a deep watery pit
2449,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS",and see the blue sand. The rocks were hidden by a thick mist. Suddenly
2450,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS","Skylla thrust forth a mighty hand and snatched six of my brave men,"
2451,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS",as a fisherman pulls out fish with a hook. I saw their hands
2452,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS","outstretched toward me as they were lifted up into the air, and I"
2453,"ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS",heard their cries for help. Woe is me! This sight will haunt me as

2462,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,
2463,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"""When we had escaped from the terrible Skylla and Charybdis, we came"
2464,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"to the island of Hēlios, the island of the Sun, and heard from afar"
2465,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,the lowing of the cattle and the bleating of the sheep. Then I
2466,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"remembered the words of Tiresias and Circè, and I advised my"
2467,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"companions not to land there at all, but to go right on, lest we suffer"
2468,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,some new disaster.
2469,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,
2470,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"""My crew would not listen to me. They commanded me to land on the"
2471,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,isle. I then made them take an oath not even to look at any of the
2472,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"cattle. We prepared our evening meal, and when it was over we talked"
2473,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"of our dear companions whom Skylla had devoured, and we mourned over"
2474,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,them until we fell asleep.
2475,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,
2476,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"""We remained a whole month on this island, on account of unfavorable"
2477,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"winds. We found the roomy grot where the nymphs danced, and the seats"
2478,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,where they sat--the nymphs who tended the flocks of Hēlios.
2479,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,
2480,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"""As long as we had a plenty of bread and wine my comrades were satisfied"
2481,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,and spared the cattle. But when our store of food was exhausted they
2482,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,roamed all over the island to see what they could get to appease their
2483,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"hunger. They snared birds and caught fish with hooks, and lived on"
2484,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,them or anything else that came to hand. But they grew poor and lean
2485,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"with hunger and nearly starved. I went off alone into the island,"
2486,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"where I had found a quiet nook, and sent up prayers to the gods to"
2487,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,show us the way out of our difficulties. There I fell asleep.
2488,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,
2489,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"""While I slumbered, Eurylochos called my men together, and said: 'All"
2490,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"kinds of death are bad enough, my brave friends, but death by"
2491,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,starvation is the worst. Let us kill the best of these cattle and
2492,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"offer sacrifices to the gods, and then eat and live. If we ever get"
2493,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"to Ithaca we will make restitution, for we will build altars to the"
2494,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,Sun and place costly gifts upon his shrine. But if it is his will
2495,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"to destroy us in his anger, then let us die amid the billows of the"
2496,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"deep, for that is better than to die by famine.'"
2497,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,
2498,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"""Thus spoke Eurylochos, and the others lent a willing ear. They seized"
2499,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"the best of the cattle at once, and slaughtered them, and prepared"
2500,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"a hearty meal. They offered up petitions to the gods, standing round"
2501,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,their victims with young oak-leaves in their hands. Then they covered
2502,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"the thighs with caul, and laid slices of fat over these, and poured"
2503,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,on water and roasted it until it was consumed. All the rest was cut
2504,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,into smaller portions and scorched on iron prongs.
2505,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,
2506,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"""At this moment I awoke and hurried down to the ship, and with horror"
2507,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"found the dreadful meal prepared. One of the nymphs, immortal"
2508,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"shepherdess, flew to the Sun to tell him that my men had slain his"
2509,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"cattle. Hēlios was deeply angered, and spoke thus before the assembled"
2510,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"gods: 'Father Zeus and all ye immortal gods, behold the comrades of"
2511,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"Odysseus! They have slaughtered my heifers, which gladdened my heart"
2512,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,as I went up to heaven and down to earth.
2513,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,
2514,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"""'If they do not pay me well for this great wrong, I shall go down"

2516,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"living.' 'Shine on, O Sun, in the bright sky,' said Zeus, 'for I will"
2517,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"cut their ship to pieces with a thunder-bolt, as it tosses on a black"
2518,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,sea.' I could only chide my comrades. I could not think of any
2519,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"sufficient redress, for the cattle were dead."
2520,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,
2521,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"""And here happened a wonder which amazed my comrades. The skins of"
2522,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"the dead animals crawled over the ground, and the flesh lowed as they"
2523,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"had done when alive. Nevertheless, my companions continued to kill"
2524,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"and eat the best oxen in the herds for six days, when a favorable"
2525,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"wind sprang up, and we went on board and set sail once more."
2526,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,
2527,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"""After we had lost sight of land, and nothing was before us but sky"
2528,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"and sea, a sudden darkness shrouded the heavens, and there arose a"
2529,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,violent storm. The vessel was hurled hither and thither by the
2530,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,towering billows; the hurricane tore the sails and dashed the mast
2531,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"against the pilot's head, crushing the bones, and he was cast headlong"
2532,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,into the sea.
2533,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,
2534,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"""Then Zeus sent a thunder-bolt into the ship, and broke it nearly"

2536,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"were shaken off into the sea and drowned. They floated round me, but"
2537,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,I moved about in the ship until the bottom and the sides had broken
2538,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,away from each other and the mast had snapped off at its base. I took
2539,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"the mast, which had a thong of bull's-hide round it, and tied it to"
2540,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"the keel. I took my seat upon this frail craft, and the storm whirled"

2542,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,
2543,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"""After awhile the west wind ceased, and the south wind began to blow,"
2544,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"which was still worse for me, since it took me back to dread Charybdis."
2545,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"All night long I was tossed on the waves, and at dawn I drew near"
2546,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"to Charybdis. As the monster was swallowing the salt brine, I caught"
2547,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,hold of the fig-tree and clung to it like a bat till she should throw
2548,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"up my poor raft. I waited long, but at last the timbers were thrown"
2549,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"out of the whirlpool, and I dropped down upon them, and sat on them"
2550,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,and rowed with my hands. I floated about on the waters for nine long

2552,ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HĒLIOS,"and detained me seven years, as I have already told thee, O Aretè,"

2563,THE DEPARTURE OF ODYSSEUS FROM THE ISLAND OF SCHERIA,"Odysseus; all were greatly interested, and when he ended they did"
2564,THE DEPARTURE OF ODYSSEUS FROM THE ISLAND OF SCHERIA,"not stir or speak a word. Alkinoös was the first to break the silence,"
2565,THE DEPARTURE OF ODYSSEUS FROM THE ISLAND OF SCHERIA,"and he said: ""Renowned Odysseus, since thou hast come to our country,"
2566,THE DEPARTURE OF ODYSSEUS FROM THE ISLAND OF SCHERIA,I hope that thy sufferings are at an end and that thou wilt reach
2567,THE DEPARTURE OF ODYSSEUS FROM THE ISLAND OF SCHERIA,"thy native land safely and soon."" Then the King turned to his guests"
2568,THE DEPARTURE OF ODYSSEUS FROM THE ISLAND OF SCHERIA,"and addressed them: ""Phæacians, let us each present one more gift,"
2569,THE DEPARTURE OF ODYSSEUS FROM THE ISLAND OF SCHERIA,"a large tripod and a vase, to the hero who has come among us."""

2573,THE DEPARTURE OF ODYSSEUS FROM THE ISLAND OF SCHERIA,"to the ship, where they were packed carefully under the benches by"
2574,THE DEPARTURE OF ODYSSEUS FROM THE ISLAND OF SCHERIA,"the King himself, and the guests returned to the palace, where a"

2576,THE DEPARTURE OF ODYSSEUS FROM THE ISLAND OF SCHERIA,
2577,THE DEPARTURE OF ODYSSEUS FROM THE ISLAND OF SCHERIA,"Alkinoös sacrificed an ox to Zeus, and they sat down at the table."
2578,THE DEPARTURE OF ODYSSEUS FROM THE ISLAND OF SCHERIA,"The enjoyment ran high, and the old poet, Demodokos, sang sweet songs."
2579,THE DEPARTURE OF ODYSSEUS FROM THE ISLAND OF SCHERIA,"They feasted all day, and when the sun was near its setting Odysseus"

2588,THE DEPARTURE OF ODYSSEUS FROM THE ISLAND OF SCHERIA,"The people approved his timely words, and seizing their goblets they"

2616,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,
2617,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,When the morning star arose the ship reached Ithaca. It entered a
2618,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"harbor called Phorkys, where there was a grotto sacred to the nymphs,"
2619,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,and it was shaded at the entrance by an olive-tree. Stone vases stood
2620,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"around in the grotto, and there bees had stored up honey. The nymphs"
2621,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"spun their fine thread from stone spindles there, and wove their"
2622,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"sea-purple robes. Springs of cool water flowed through the grotto,"
2623,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,and there was an entrance for mortals and one which was kept holy
2624,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,for the gods.
2625,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,
2626,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,When the ship touched the beach the sailors disembarked and carried
2627,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,the sleeping Odysseus on a rug on to the shore and laid him down.
2628,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,They brought his presents also from under the ship's benches and laid
2629,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"them under the olive-tree, a short distance from the road, for fear"
2630,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,that some evil-minded person would take them before Odysseus woke
2631,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,up.
2632,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,
2633,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"Then the crew sailed homeward, but Poseidon saw them and was angry"
2634,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,because his purpose to cause Odysseus endless suffering had been
2635,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,thwarted. He at once complained to Zeus that the Phæacians had
2636,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"restored Odysseus to his native land, with gifts finer and more"
2637,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,valuable than anything he could have brought from Troy. Zeus listened
2638,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,to his complaint and gave him authority to destroy the Phæacian boat
2639,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"and its crew. Poseidon promptly repaired to the island of Scheria,"
2640,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,and when the ship came in sight of the town he transformed it into
2641,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"a towering rock, that it might hide the island from mariners and the"
2642,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,Phæacians would no longer be tempted to escort strangers to their

2644,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,
2645,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"The ship had gone, and it was broad daylight when Odysseus awoke."
2646,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"He did not recognize his own country, he had been away from it for"
2647,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"such a long time, and besides that, Athena had spread a dense fog"
2648,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,over it. His first thought was that the Phæacians had deceived him
2649,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"and left him on an unknown shore. He began to accuse them of treachery,"
2650,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,and prayed to Zeus to punish them. He looked around and found that
2651,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"his gifts had been carefully placed, so he knew that he had not been"
2652,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,robbed. He counted his gifts and examined them.

2654,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,There were tripods and vases of gold and brass and beautiful
2655,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,hand-woven garments. He paced up and down the shore and wept and wailed
2656,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,aloud. Then Athena appeared to him disguised as a shepherd lad.
2657,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,
2658,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"When Odysseus saw her, he hastened to her and said: ""Hail, fair youth!"
2659,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,I am a stranger and find myself for the first time in this place.
2660,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"I entreat thee to tell me the name of this country, and what kind"
2661,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"of people inhabit it."" The goddess answered him: ""Truly, stranger,"
2662,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"thou must come from a far-off land that thou dost not know Ithaca,"
2663,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,which is known from the rising to the setting of the sun.
2664,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,
2665,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"""It is indeed a stony island but it is not barren, nor is it a good"
2666,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,place for raising horses. It is rich in grain and grapes. It has an
2667,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"abundance of dew and rain, and most delicious wine is made here."
2668,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,Nowhere can be found handsomer goats or finer cattle. Every kind of
2669,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"tree grows in its forests, and its springs are never dry. The fame"
2670,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"of Ithaca has reached even as far as Troy itself which, I am told,"
2671,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"lies far from Hellas."""
2672,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,
2673,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,Odysseus was overjoyed to find that he was in his own country. But
2674,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"he did not venture to tell his name to the shepherd, nor whence he"
2675,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"came. Instead of that he told a long story that he came from Crete,"
2676,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,which he had been obliged to leave because he had killed the King's
2677,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"son, who had robbed him."
2678,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,
2679,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"Athena smiled and, assuming the form of a beautiful woman, took him"
2680,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"by the hand and said: ""Thou crafty man, why dost thou tell such lies?"
2681,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"Dost thou not know Athena, daughter of Zeus, who has protected thee"
2682,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,everywhere and saved thee from all danger? I have just come again
2683,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,to assist thee in hiding thy treasures and to tell thee what thou
2684,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,must encounter in thine own palace. But thou must not repeat anything
2685,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"which I tell thee, nor make thyself known to any man or woman. And"
2686,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"thou must bear many indignities in silence until the right time comes,"
2687,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"for there are many violent men in thy halls."""
2688,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,
2689,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,Odysseus's heart was filled with joy. He knelt down and kissed the
2690,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"soil of his native land. ""Tell me, is it true,"" he said, ""that I am"
2691,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"in my own beloved Ithaca? I pray thee, goddess, do not jest with me."""
2692,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,
2693,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"""Thy native land! Such ever is thy thought,"" answered the goddess."
2694,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"""Any other man would have hastened with all speed to his wife and"
2695,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,home. But thou must wait and come not at once into the presence of
2696,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"Penelope. She sits within thy palace, weeping night and day because"
2697,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"thou dost not come. Hide thy gifts here in this grotto, and I will"
2698,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"tell thee what to do next."""
2699,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,
2700,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,With a glad heart Odysseus saluted the nymphs of the cave and spring:
2701,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"""Hail to you, nymphs of my native land, daughters of Zeus! I thought"
2702,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,I should never see you again. I shall bring you rich gifts in days
2703,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"to come, if it please Athena to keep me from harm."" After he had carried"
2704,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"the presents into the grotto and carefully hidden them, he sat down"
2705,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"with the goddess among the gnarled roots of the olive-tree, and they"
2706,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,laid plots to destroy Penelope's impudent suitors. Athena told him
2707,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,about the trouble they had caused her; how they had established
2708,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"themselves in her own home, trying to win her for a wife. For three"
2709,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"years the noble Penelope had kept these arrogant men in suspense,"
2710,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"deluded with empty hopes, while she waited for her husband's return."
2711,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"When Odysseus heard these words he was greatly disturbed, and said:"
2712,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"""Woe is me! I might have been slain in my own home but for these timely"
2713,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"words. Now I am forearmed. Stand by me, I pray, in my great need,"
2714,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"and give me strength to meet my enemies. If thou art my helper, I"
2715,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"can resist, single-handed, three hundred foes."""
2716,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,
2717,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"""Take courage,"" said the goddess. ""But to carry out our plans I must"
2718,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,change thee to a miserable old man with a wrinkled face and clad in
2719,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"ragged garments, so that no one can recognize thee."
2720,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,
2721,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"""Then must thou go to thy faithful swineherd, Eumaios, who loves thy"

2725,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"the mountain, Korax, and the spring, Arethusa. He will tell thee all"
2726,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,the doings in thy house. Meantime I will take my way to Sparta.
2727,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"Telemachos, thy son, is there. He went to visit Menelaos and try to"

2729,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"to Ithaca."""
2730,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,
2731,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,The goddess touched Odysseus with her magic wand. At once he shrank
2732,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,"and withered into a wrinkled, shabby, old beggar. Then she gave him"
2733,ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA,a staff and a tattered sack and sent him to his loyal swineherd while

2743,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,
2744,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,
2745,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,Odysseus left the haven by a narrow stony path and took his way to
2746,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"the dwelling of his faithful swineherd, who thought more of the"
2747,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,welfare of his master than did all the rest of the servants whom
2748,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,Odysseus had. He found him seated in the yard which he himself had
2749,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"made of stone for the swine of the absent King, and had enclosed with"
2750,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,a thick hedge of thorns. He had driven strong posts of oak around
2751,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"it, also. Inside the yard he had made twelve sties, and in each sty"
2752,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,there were fifty sows with their little ones. The males were kept
2753,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"outside and were fewer in number, for Eumaios was compelled to send"
2754,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"a very fat one to the suitors every day, and therefore there were"
2755,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,only eighteen score.
2756,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,
2757,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,Near them were four large savage dogs as guards. They were more like
2758,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,wolves than dogs. Eumaios was busy making a pair of sandals from an
2759,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"ox-hide, for his own use. The other swineherds had gone on errands,"
2760,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"three of them to drive pigs to pasture, while the fourth had taken"
2761,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,a hog to the suitors in the city.
2762,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,
2763,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"When the dogs saw Odysseus they barked and rushed upon him, and they"
2764,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"would have torn him to pieces, but Eumaios drove them off with stones"
2765,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"and said: ""Thou poor old man, the dogs came very near tearing thee"
2766,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"limb from limb, and that would have been a great shame and sorrow"
2767,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,to me.
2768,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,
2769,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"""The gods have already sent me trouble enough. Here I sit weeping"
2770,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"and mourning for my beloved master, and take care of his swine in"
2771,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,order that strangers may eat them. Who knows where he may be wandering
2772,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"as a beggar among people who speak another tongue? But come, old man,"
2773,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"let us go into my lodge and eat, and then thou mayest tell me who"
2774,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"thou art and what misfortunes thou hast suffered."""
2775,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,
2776,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,Odysseus followed the swineherd into the cabin. Eumaios threw an
2777,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,armful of rushes on the floor and covered it with a rug of goat-skin
2778,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,and bade his guest be seated.
2779,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,
2780,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"Odysseus was gratified at this kind reception, and said to the"
2781,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"swineherd: ""May Zeus and all the other immortal gods give thee, my"

2783,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,
2784,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"The good swineherd answered him: ""My guest, I should consider it a"
2785,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"great sin not to receive a stranger hospitably, even if he looked"
2786,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,more miserable than thou. Strangers and beggars are children of Zeus.
2787,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"The hospitality I can extend to thee is slight but sincere, for"
2788,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"servants have little to offer, especially when, like me, they have"
2789,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,new masters. Odysseus loved me much. Would that the gods might send
2790,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,him back to us. He would have paid me for my toil. He would have given
2791,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"me a home, a little land, and a wife. But he is dead. May the whole"

2794,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,
2795,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,The swineherd drew his belt around him and hastened to the pen where
2796,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,the pigs were shut up. He seized two little pigs and slew them and
2797,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,roasted them on a spit over the fire. He sprinkled salt over the savory
2798,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,meat and brought it to Odysseus. And he brought delicate wine in a
2799,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"wooden cup, as well."
2800,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,
2801,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"Then he said: ""Eat, stranger, for this is the best I have to give."
2802,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"The suitors, who fear neither god nor man, eat the fat hogs. They"
2803,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"gorge themselves with the costliest food in the house, both wine and"
2804,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"meat, and only these little lean porkers are left for us. Yet there"
2805,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"is still an abundance, for my master was very rich. He had twelve"
2806,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"herds of horned cattle and as many swine on the mainland, and twelve"
2807,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"flocks of sheep and goats. Here, on the island, graze eleven flocks"
2808,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"of goats, tended by as many trusty herdsmen, each of whom has to send"
2809,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"a fattened goat for the table of the suitors every day. As for myself,"
2810,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"I take care of these swine, and each day I choose the best to send"

2812,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,
2813,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,Odysseus ate the flesh and drank the wine while Eumaios was telling
2814,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"him these things, and could hardly keep from giving vent to his anger."
2815,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,But he kept silence and meditated vengeance on the suitors. When the
2816,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"meal was done he said: ""Tell me, I pray thee, all about thy rich and"

2818,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,the Trojans. Perhaps I know him and can give thee some information
2819,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"concerning him."""
2820,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,
2821,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"The noble swineherd answered: ""Be silent, aged man, for we have ceased"
2822,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,to believe the tales told us by wanderers. Every beggar who comes

2824,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"Odysseus, and tries to make her think that he will come home in a"

2832,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,I shall never find such a kind master again. Even my father and mother

2851,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"Odysseus might come. But now, as if we had not troubles enough, a"

2854,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"the ungodly suitors have sent out a ship to watch for him, and kill"

2867,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"Returning, he wandered about, and, after many adventures, met"

2871,ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD,"He told the tale so well that the swineherd believed him, and even"

2917,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,not be annoyed by their boisterous behavior. He bade him sit down
2918,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"on a throne, and placed a foot-stool under his feet. Then he drew"
2919,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"his own chair from among the suitors and sat near the stranger, hoping"
2920,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,to hear news of his absent father. A maid brought a silver pitcher
2921,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,and basin and let the stranger wash his hands. A table was placed
2922,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"before him, laden with the choicest viands, while a herald filled"
2923,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"a goblet with wine for him. When they had enjoyed their meal,"
2924,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,Telemachos asked the stranger his name and country.
2925,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,
2926,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"""I am Mentor, son of the Taphian King,"" said Athena. ""I came here"
2927,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"in my ship with a crew of friends, on a journey to the Isle of Cyprus,"
2928,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"in search of copper, and I brought iron to give in exchange. I am"
2929,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"an old friend of Odysseus. I have left my ship in the bay, back of"
2930,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,the forest. Laertes will tell thee who I am. It is said that he does
2931,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"not come to the palace any more, but lives alone in the country,"
2932,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,mourning over the loss of his son day and night. It seems that the
2933,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,gods have long delayed Odysseus. Who knows where he is? I am sure
2934,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"that he is not dead. And now tell me, what feast is going on here,"
2935,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,and who are these men? Are they invited guests? Is it a banquet I
2936,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"see, or is there to be a wedding? It is not a pleasant sight in any"
2937,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"case, for the men are coarse in their actions and ungodly in their"
2938,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,speech. Every friend of Odysseus must feel sad to see them in this
2939,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"place."""
2940,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,
2941,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"""As long as my father was here,"" answered Telemachos, ""our house was"
2942,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"respectable and rich. But the gods have forsaken us, and we are"
2943,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,destined to destruction. No news of my father's death has ever reached
2944,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"us; nevertheless, all the young men of the first families of Ithaca"
2945,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,and the surrounding isles flock to our house and seek my mother for
2946,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,a wife and squander my father's riches. My mother does not favor the
2947,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"idea of another marriage, and has not promised herself to any of the"
2948,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"suitors. She fears them, and so she does not reject their suits, yet"
2949,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,she will not end the trouble by marrying one of them. They will not
2950,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"go away, but make themselves at home here and eat up my inheritance."
2951,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"They only want a favorable opportunity to kill me."""
2952,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,
2953,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"Athena grew angry at this, and said: ""I would that Odysseus might"
2954,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,come this very moment to chastise these atrocious fellows. Woe to
2955,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,them if he should appear at the door with his helmet and shield and
2956,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"two tough spears, just as he looked when I first beheld him in my"
2957,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,own home. Then these suitors would find a bitter marriage-feast and
2958,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"a speedy end. Vengeance, however, rests with the gods."
2959,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,
2960,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"""Now, let me consider the best way to get these suitors out of the"
2961,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"house. As an old friend of thy father, let me advise thee. To-morrow"
2962,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,call thy people together in council and tell the suitors to depart.
2963,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"If thy mother has any inclination to wed again, send her to her"
2964,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"father's house. He is rich and powerful, and can give her a splendid"
2965,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"wedding, such as is suitable for the daughter of a king, and bestow"
2966,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,an ample dower.
2967,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,
2968,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"""Then launch thy finest ship. Man it with twenty good oarsmen and"
2969,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,put out to sea in search of thy father. Sail to Pylos first and consult
2970,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"with Nestor, and go to Sparta next and see Menelaos, who has returned"
2971,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,from Troy recently. Stay with him awhile if he can assure thee that
2972,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"thy father lives. But if he tells thee that thy father is surely dead,"
2973,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"return as quickly as possible and build a mound to him, and cause"

2977,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"""Thou art no longer a child, and it is not seemly to allow such"

2979,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"When thou hast performed these deeds, let thy care be to drive out"

2986,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"some handsome gift, such as one always bestows upon an honored guest."""
2987,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,
2988,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"""Telemachos, do not detain me longer,"" replied Athena. ""I must depart"
2989,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"at once. Keep thy gift until I return, and then I will take it to"
2990,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"my home."" She vanished as she spoke, and all that Telemachos saw was"
2991,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,a fleet-winged bird flying upward high in the air. Telemachos was
2992,ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS,"astonished, and knew that he had been talking face to face with some"

3007,TELEMACHOS ASTONISHES THE WOOERS,and she came down the lofty stairway attended by two maids. She
3008,TELEMACHOS ASTONISHES THE WOOERS,"implored the bard, with tears to change the song, since it was the"

3035,TELEMACHOS ASTONISHES THE WOOERS,"The suitors danced and sang, eating and drinking, until evening,"

3055,PENELOPE'S WEB,"The next morning, at dawn of day, Telemachos rose from his bed and"
3056,PENELOPE'S WEB,put on his garments. He hung his sword over his shoulder and fastened
3057,PENELOPE'S WEB,his sandals on his feet and strode bravely forth. He summoned his
3058,PENELOPE'S WEB,heralds at once and bade them call a council of the Ithacans. The
3059,PENELOPE'S WEB,"people came at the appointed time, and Telemachos, sceptre in hand,"
3060,PENELOPE'S WEB,took his place before the assembly and called it to order.
3061,PENELOPE'S WEB,
3062,PENELOPE'S WEB,"""I have not summoned you, my friends,"" he said, ""in order that ye"
3063,PENELOPE'S WEB,"may see some entertaining show, but out of dire necessity. I bring"
3064,PENELOPE'S WEB,no news of war and I have nothing to say that concerns the public
3065,PENELOPE'S WEB,good. You all know the grief which has befallen me on account of my
3066,PENELOPE'S WEB,"father, your king and leader, who loved you as a parent loves his"
3067,PENELOPE'S WEB,children. But Odysseus is gone and there is no hope of his return.
3068,PENELOPE'S WEB,"This misfortune is not enough, for every day the young men of the"
3069,PENELOPE'S WEB,leading families of Ithaca and the surrounding isles meet in my house
3070,PENELOPE'S WEB,and vex my mother with unseemly and importunate offers of marriage.
3071,PENELOPE'S WEB,
3072,PENELOPE'S WEB,"""There they are now installed, eating our food, drinking our wine,"
3073,PENELOPE'S WEB,"and wasting our money, for Odysseus is not here to drive them out."
3074,PENELOPE'S WEB,"I have no way of expelling them from my home. My friends, consider"
3075,PENELOPE'S WEB,these wrongs and help me to drive these robbers from the house of
3076,PENELOPE'S WEB,your king. It would be a shame to the people of Ithaca if it were
3077,PENELOPE'S WEB,noised around that they left the son of their chief in the hands of
3078,PENELOPE'S WEB,"plunderers without giving him help."""
3079,PENELOPE'S WEB,
3080,PENELOPE'S WEB,"Thus spoke Telemachos, the tears running down his cheeks, and he threw"
3081,PENELOPE'S WEB,"the sceptre on the ground. The people were greatly moved, and felt"
3082,PENELOPE'S WEB,"pity for the youth who had to suffer such wrongs, but they were silent."
3083,PENELOPE'S WEB,"Only Antinoös, the most insolent of the suitors, took up the word"
3084,PENELOPE'S WEB,"and said: ""Shameless Telemachos, how dost thou dare to chide us for"
3085,PENELOPE'S WEB,this state of things! Thy mother is the one to blame. She has been
3086,PENELOPE'S WEB,leading us on for three whole years. She is skilful and crafty. She
3087,PENELOPE'S WEB,"promised, three years ago, to choose one of us for a husband as soon"
3088,PENELOPE'S WEB,as she should finish the winding-sheets for old Laertes in case of
3089,PENELOPE'S WEB,his death.
3090,PENELOPE'S WEB,
3091,PENELOPE'S WEB,"""Then she began to weave upon her loom a dainty web of vast length"
3092,PENELOPE'S WEB,"and width. And she said to each one of us: 'Do not urge me to marry,"
3093,PENELOPE'S WEB,"I pray, until I finish these shrouds for the hero Laertes, when his"
3094,PENELOPE'S WEB,"hour of death shall come. I have spun an abundance of fine thread,"
3095,PENELOPE'S WEB,"and it must not be wasted. Besides that, the dames of Greece would"
3096,PENELOPE'S WEB,"speak ill of me if I should leave my husband's father without a shroud,"
3097,PENELOPE'S WEB,for he has had great wealth all his life.' In this way Penelope gave
3098,PENELOPE'S WEB,"us hope, and we were too generous to persist in forcing her to choose"
3099,PENELOPE'S WEB,at once.
3100,PENELOPE'S WEB,
3101,PENELOPE'S WEB,"""She went on in this way, weaving the great web by day, and every"
3102,PENELOPE'S WEB,night she unravelled by torchlight all that she had woven by sunlight.
3103,PENELOPE'S WEB,She has deceived us long enough. We have discovered her fraud; for
3104,PENELOPE'S WEB,a woman who has seen her unravelling the web has told us all about
3105,PENELOPE'S WEB,it. She must finish the work and make her choice among her suitors.
3106,PENELOPE'S WEB,"If thou dost wish us to leave thy house, thou shalt send thy mother"
3107,PENELOPE'S WEB,"to her parents and let her father command her to marry one of us,"
3108,PENELOPE'S WEB,according to her choice. When this is done no one will disturb thee
3109,PENELOPE'S WEB,any longer.
3110,PENELOPE'S WEB,
3111,PENELOPE'S WEB,"""If, however, Penelope prefers to treat the noble sons of Greece with"
3112,PENELOPE'S WEB,"such malice and craft, we will go right on consuming thy goods. She"
3113,PENELOPE'S WEB,"will thus make a great name for herself, but she will impoverish thee."""
3114,PENELOPE'S WEB,
3115,PENELOPE'S WEB,"""I shall never send my mother away from her husband's house,"" rejoined"
3116,PENELOPE'S WEB,"Telemachos. ""Living or dead, my father is in distant lands, and if"
3117,PENELOPE'S WEB,"I should dismiss his wife of my own will, I should invite the hatred"
3118,PENELOPE'S WEB,of the gods on my guilty head. She would call upon the Furies to haunt
3119,PENELOPE'S WEB,me; all men would curse me; and her father would demand ample
3120,PENELOPE'S WEB,satisfaction of me. I will never speak the word to send her forth.
3121,PENELOPE'S WEB,"Now, get you gone and cease squandering my riches or I will call down"

3123,PENELOPE'S WEB,
3124,PENELOPE'S WEB,"Having said this, Telemachos sat down, and Zeus sent two eagles flying"
3125,PENELOPE'S WEB,"over the heads of the wooers, close to each other. They looked down"
3126,PENELOPE'S WEB,upon the crowd of people and tore each other's heads and vanished.
3127,PENELOPE'S WEB,"The Ithacans saw the deadly omen, and a venerable prophet among them"
3128,PENELOPE'S WEB,"stood up and said: ""Noble youths, I advise you seriously to depart"
3129,PENELOPE'S WEB,"from this royal house, for this is a sign that Odysseus is coming"
3130,PENELOPE'S WEB,home. Woe to you if he finds you in his palace. You will all meet
3131,PENELOPE'S WEB,"a direful end."""
3132,PENELOPE'S WEB,
3133,PENELOPE'S WEB,"Eurymachos answered him: ""Old man, keep thy advice and thy forebodings"
3134,PENELOPE'S WEB,for thine own children. We do not need them. Advise Telemachos to
3135,PENELOPE'S WEB,"change his mind and send his mother home to her father, instead of"
3136,PENELOPE'S WEB,prating foolishly to us. As long as he keeps her here we shall continue
3137,PENELOPE'S WEB,"to consume his wealth, until he has nothing left. And we will punish"
3138,PENELOPE'S WEB,"thee severely if thou dost incite this young man to violence."""
3139,PENELOPE'S WEB,
3140,PENELOPE'S WEB,"Telemachos, thinking it best to be discreet, replied: ""Now hear me,"
3141,PENELOPE'S WEB,"Eurymachos, and all ye suitors. Give me a good ship and twenty men,"
3142,PENELOPE'S WEB,that I may go from land to land in search of my father. If I find
3143,PENELOPE'S WEB,"that he lives and may return, I will wait one year longer for him"
3144,PENELOPE'S WEB,"to reach home. But if I hear that he is not alive, I will come back"
3145,PENELOPE'S WEB,and build a mound to his memory and give him a funeral worthy of such

3147,PENELOPE'S WEB,
3148,PENELOPE'S WEB,"Mentor, the stanch friend and adviser of Odysseus, sat among the"
3149,PENELOPE'S WEB,"Ithacans in the assembly. When he saw how Telemachos was put to shame,"
3150,PENELOPE'S WEB,"he grew angry. He rose to his feet, and addressed the people: ""No"
3151,PENELOPE'S WEB,"king ever again should be wise and good. He should be hard and unjust,"
3152,PENELOPE'S WEB,since no one of you has enough love for Odysseus to stand by his son.
3153,PENELOPE'S WEB,"I am less ashamed of the impudent suitors, than I am of the weaklings"
3154,PENELOPE'S WEB,"who see what they are doing and who dare not interfere."""
3155,PENELOPE'S WEB,
3156,PENELOPE'S WEB,"""Foolish old Mentor,"" said one of the suitors, ""what art thou saying!"
3157,PENELOPE'S WEB,"If Odysseus, himself, should come hither, he would not be able to"

3202,THE JOURNEY OF TELEMACHOS,eyelids of the drunken suitors. They gladly sought their beds in their
3203,THE JOURNEY OF TELEMACHOS,"own homes. Taking the form of Mentor, she next appeared to Telemachos"
3204,THE JOURNEY OF TELEMACHOS,"and bade him follow her to the beach. When they reached the galley,"
3205,THE JOURNEY OF TELEMACHOS,he found his comrades waiting. They hurried up to the palace for the
3206,THE JOURNEY OF TELEMACHOS,"wine and meal, which they soon brought to the ship and stored in the"
3207,THE JOURNEY OF TELEMACHOS,hold. Then the crew slipped the cables which held the ship to the
3208,THE JOURNEY OF TELEMACHOS,shore. Athena took her seat at the stern and Telemachos sat near her.
3209,THE JOURNEY OF TELEMACHOS,The sails were spread and the sailors began to ply their oars. Athena
3210,THE JOURNEY OF TELEMACHOS,raised a favorable breeze and the vessel glided forward cutting her
3211,THE JOURNEY OF TELEMACHOS,way through the roaring waters.

3219,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,
3220,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,At sunrise the ship arrived at Pylos. The people of that town were
3221,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"all assembled on the shore, where they were sacrificing coal-black"
3222,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"oxen to Poseidon. Some were burning fat upon the altar, and others"
3223,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"were distributing food among those who were offering up the sacrifices,"
3224,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,while all were eating.
3225,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,
3226,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"The Ithacans touched land. Telemachos and Athena disembarked,"
3227,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"leaving the crew to guard the ship, and went up to the crowd. On the"
3228,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,way Athena cheered Telemachos and advised him what to say to the people.
3229,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"When they had come near enough to the inhabitants to be seen by them,"
3230,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"the people rose and came to meet the strangers. First of all, the"
3231,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"son of Nestor, Peisistratos, approached and took each of them by the"
3232,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,hand and led them to the feast. He bade them be seated near his father
3233,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,and brought them the choicest meat.
3234,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,
3235,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"After the strangers had eaten, Peisistratos filled a golden goblet"
3236,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"with wine, and handed it to Mentor, as the elder. Mentor was pleased"
3237,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,with the young man's good breeding and he took the goblet and poured
3238,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"out a part of it on the ground as a sacrifice to Poseidon, with a"
3239,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"prayer for a safe return. Then he handed the goblet to Telemachos,"
3240,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,and he did likewise.
3241,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,
3242,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"When the feast was over, Nestor, the King of Pylos, said to his guests:"
3243,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"""The time has come, dear strangers, when it is fitting to ask your"
3244,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"names, and from what land you come. Do you roam the seas as pirates,"
3245,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"or do you come on an errand?"""
3246,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,
3247,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"""We are Greeks,"" said Telemachos. ""We come from Ithaca to seek tidings"
3248,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"of my father, the unfortunate Odysseus, who went to war against Troy"
3249,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,with thee and the other Greek chiefs. We have never heard anything
3250,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,of him during all these long years and do not know whether he is living
3251,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"or dead. I pray thee tell me anything thou may'st know about him,"
3252,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"and conceal nothing."""
3253,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,
3254,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"""My son,"" Nestor replied, ""thou dost call to mind the great sufferings"
3255,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,borne by the men of Greece ere we succeeded in conquering Priam's
3256,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"town. It would take years to tell thee of the brave deeds of the Greeks,"
3257,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,how they fought and where they fell. We passed nine years in worrying
3258,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"the enemy, and there was no man who gave better counsel or performed"
3259,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,nobler deeds than did Odysseus. Art thou then his son? I look on thee
3260,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"in wonder. Yes, thou art like him. How strange to hear so young a"
3261,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,man speak as he did!
3262,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,
3263,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"""After the destruction of Troy, the surviving Greeks embarked, and"
3264,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"we set out for home. But when we reached Tenedos, thy father returned"
3265,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"to Troy to join Agamemnon and the others, who had stayed behind, to"
3266,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"appease the wrath of Athena, for a Greek had committed sacrilege in"
3267,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,her temple.
3268,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,
3269,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"""Our voyage was prosperous, and we all reached home except Menelaos,"
3270,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,who wandered about in Crete and Egypt for a long time. It is said
3271,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"that the noble son of Achilles returned home safely, and that"
3272,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"Agamemnon was slain in his own house, and his son took vengeance on"
3273,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"his murderers. There is a rumor, too, that many suitors hang about"
3274,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"thy mother, and, in spite of thy remonstrances, consume thy riches."
3275,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"Be brave, my son, and yield not. Odysseus may come again. Go at once"
3276,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"to Menelaos, for he may have news of thy father. I will give thee"
3277,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"swift horses and a chariot, and my sons will drive."""
3278,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,
3279,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"All day Telemachos discoursed with Nestor, and when the sun went down,"
3280,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,they poured wine on the earth and burned an offering to the gods.
3281,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"Telemachos and Mentor arose to retire to their ship, but Nestor begged"
3282,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"them to be his guests and go to the royal palace. Mentor, as the elder"
3283,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"of the two, excused himself, in order to join the crew, and suddenly"
3284,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,disappeared. Nestor recognized that Telemachos was attended by the
3285,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"goddess, and offered a prayer to her. The assembly dispersed, and"
3286,TELEMACHOS IN PYLOS,"Nestor, with his guest and his sons, retired to his palace."

3293,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,
3294,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,
3295,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"Before the sun was fairly up, they all arose and seated themselves"
3296,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"on the smooth stone benches that loomed up in the gloaming, white"
3297,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"and shining, before the gates of the palace. Nestor bade one of his"
3298,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"sons to prepare an offering to Athena, of the best heifer in the fields."
3299,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,He sent another son to call a skilled workman to plate the heifer's
3300,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"horns with gold, and two others yet to bring the crew from the ship."
3301,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,He told the remaining two sons to bid the maids prepare a sumptuous
3302,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,feast in honor of their guest.
3303,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,
3304,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,In a moment there was a busy scene. The heifer was brought up from
3305,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"the fields, and her horns were adorned with pure gold in hopes that"
3306,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"Athena would see it and be pleased. The sailors came from the ship,"
3307,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,except two who were left as guards. The heifer was slain and parts
3308,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"were burned as an offering to the goddess, and cakes and wine also"
3309,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,were thrown into the flames to complete the sacrifice. They roasted
3310,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"the flesh on long iron forks with five prongs, and feasted upon it."
3311,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,
3312,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"Then Nestor said to his sons: ""Bring now the chariot and horses and"
3313,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,let our guest depart in search of news concerning his renowned
3314,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"father."" The horses were soon harnessed to the car, which was stored"
3315,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,with wine and bread and dainties fit for a prince. Telemachos climbed
3316,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,into the seat. Peisistratos took his place beside him and grasped
3317,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"the reins. The horses dashed off in high spirit, and Pylos was soon"
3318,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,left in the distance. All day the horses sped along. At night they
3319,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,rested by the way and early the next morning went on again as swiftly
3320,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"as before. As the sun went down they found themselves in Sparta, the"
3321,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"land of plenty, and at the gates of Menelaos, the king."
3322,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,
3323,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,Here they found many guests assembled at the wedding banquet of
3324,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"Hermione, the daughter of Menelaos. That day she had been given as"
3325,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"a bride to Neoptolemos, the son of Achilles. A minstrel was playing"
3326,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"a harp and singing, while two dancers performed graceful feats to"
3327,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,give life to the feast.
3328,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,
3329,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"One of the attendants of Menelaos saw the strangers drive up, and"
3330,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,stepped out to see who was coming. Then he hastened back to Menelaos
3331,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,and told him that two strangers of princely bearing were at the palace
3332,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"gate, and asked if he should unharness their horses or send them on"
3333,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,their way. Menelaos was vexed that any of his servants should be so
3334,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"lax in hospitality, and told him he had acted like a foolish child,"
3335,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,and reminded him of the gifts that had been showered on them when
3336,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,they wandered so long in foreign lands. And he bade him hasten to
3337,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"unharness the steeds, and give them oats and barley, and bid the"
3338,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,strangers welcome to the feast.
3339,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,
3340,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,Telemachos and Peisistratos were amazed at the beauty of the palace.
3341,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"They bathed in the marble baths, rubbed themselves with oil and put"
3342,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,on the splendid tunics that were brought them. After that they entered
3343,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"the great hall, where each was seated on a throne near the king. A"
3344,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"handmaid brought a golden pitcher and a silver bowl for their hands,"
3345,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,and a table was placed before them laden with choice food. When they
3346,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"had eaten enough, golden beakers of wine were handed them, and then"
3347,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"the monarch gave his hand to each of them, saying: ""Ye have come in"
3348,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"good time, my friends. As soon as ye have finished your feast, I will"
3349,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"ask your names and whence ye come, for ye look like sons of kings."""
3350,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,
3351,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"As they sat there Telemachos, bending his head toward Peisistratos,"
3352,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"said, in a low tone, so that he thought no one else would hear: ""Surely,"
3353,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"O son of Nestor, the Olympian home of Zeus himself could not be more"
3354,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"glorious than this palace. See the gold and ivory, and shining brass."
3355,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"These things are beyond price in richness."" Menelaos caught the words,"
3356,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"although he spoke so low, and said: ""My sons, there is no palace that"
3357,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,can compare with the home of the gods. The riches which you look at
3358,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,in astonishment I collected while wandering in Egypt and in Crete.
3359,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"I find no pleasure in them, however, for I found my brother, King"
3360,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,Agamemnon slain when I reached home. Would that the men who fought
3361,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,before Troy had their share of this wealth! I often weep and mourn
3362,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"for them in my palace, and am unable to eat or sleep on account of"
3363,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,the misery I have brought upon my friends.
3364,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,
3365,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"""For none of them do I mourn so much as I do for Odysseus, who suffered"
3366,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"the most of all on my behalf. I would gladly give all my wealth, if"
3367,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,I only knew him to be safe. But we do not know whether he is dead
3368,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,or living. How much his old father must have grieved for him. How
3369,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"many tears his wife, Penelope, must have shed, and his high-minded"
3370,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"son, Telemachos, what sorrow he has suffered."""
3371,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,
3372,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"New despair filled the heart of Telemachos, and tears fell from his"
3373,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,eyes. He held his purple mantle to hide his grief and wept in silence.
3374,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"When Menelaos saw this, he at once suspected that the young man was"
3375,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"no other than the sorrowing son of Odysseus, and he felt perplexed"
3376,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,for want of suitable words. He could not decide whether to question
3377,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"him about his father, or to wait and let the youth speak out of his"
3378,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,own will.
3379,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,
3380,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"Just then Helen entered the hall from her high-roofed chamber, looking"
3381,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,like a goddess in her dazzling beauty. She sat down at her husband's
3382,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"feet, while servants ran to bring the mat which she was weaving and"
3383,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,the distaff filled with fine-spun purple thread. Her fingers flew
3384,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"over the dainty work while she questioned the king: ""Didst thou ask"
3385,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,the strangers their names? It is not possible that there can be any
3386,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"man so like to Odysseus except his son, as is this youth! I see him"
3387,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"with astonishment. His father left him at home a little babe, when"
3388,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,the Greeks went forth to war for my sake. Is it not true that this
3389,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"is Telemachos?"""
3390,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,
3391,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"Menelaos replied: ""My wife, I think thou hast spoken truly. The young"
3392,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"man has the hands, the feet, and the features of Odysseus, and he"
3393,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"cannot hide his grief at the mention of that hero's name."""
3394,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"Peisistratos took up the word and said: ""He is, indeed, the son of"
3395,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"Odysseus, O king! My father, Nestor, sent me with him to inquire what"
3396,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"you might know of the long-lost chieftain, and to beg you to give"
3397,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"him advice, for he has to suffer great wrongs in his house and there"
3398,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"is no one to assist him."""
3399,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,
3400,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,Menelaos was heartily glad to hear that his guest was really
3401,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,Telemachos. But the remembrance of his old friend overcame him and
3402,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"he wept bitter tears. ""I thought when I was in Troy,"" he said, ""that"
3403,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,I should one day welcome Odysseus to my home. I would have given him
3404,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,land and cities and brought to Sparta all his people and his wealth.
3405,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,Then we would always have lived close together and nothing could have
3406,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"parted us. But he has never returned."" The tears fell from his eyes"
3407,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"and Helen wept as well. Peisistratos then said to Menelaos: ""Son of"
3408,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"Atreus, my father says that thou art good and wise. Let us not, I"
3409,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"entreat, continue this sad discourse, since this is a day that should"
3410,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"not be given to lamentations. I lost a brother, also, at Troy. But"
3411,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"we will honor these heroes at a proper time, with tears and by cutting"
3412,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"off our locks. Let us not spoil the feast with mourning."""
3413,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,
3414,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,They spent the rest of the day in making the festival as cheerful
3415,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"as if there were no grief to be hidden, and when night came the Argive"
3416,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,Helen ordered the servants to prepare beds for them in the portico
3417,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"and cover them with tapestries, while she poured for them a soothing"
3418,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,wine and dismissed them to their slumbers. The heralds led them to
3419,TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA,"their couches, where they found a welcome rest."

3430,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,"went into his hall looking like a god. He sat down near Telemachos,"

3432,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,
3433,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,"Telemachos then told him of the evil deeds of the suitors, and besought"

3443,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,
3444,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,"""It happened that the gods detained me many days in Egypt to sacrifice"
3445,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,"and do penance, for I had forgotten to make proper offerings to them."
3446,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,The island of Pharos lies just off the coast of Egypt. There I remained
3447,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,"until the daughter of the Ancient Sea King, seeing my distress, came"

3449,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,
3450,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,"""My men and I had wandered over the island in search of food until"
3451,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,"we were nearly starved, when she discovered us, and told us that our"
3452,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,efforts would be useless unless we consulted with her father. 'If
3453,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,"thou canst ensnare him and hold him in thy grasp,' she said, 'he will"
3454,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,"tell thee how to reach thy home. He is a seer, and can tell thee all"
3455,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,that has taken place there during thy absence. At noon-tide he comes
3456,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,"out from the ocean caves covered with brine, and lies down among the"
3457,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,"sea-calves, rank with the smell of salt. He counts them five at a"

3459,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,"He is very shrewd, and when thou hast caught him he will struggle"
3460,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,"and take all sorts of forms to escape thee. He will turn into a reptile,"
3461,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,"and into fire and then will change to water. But hold him fast, and"
3462,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,"when he looks as he did when first perceived by thee, ask him how"
3463,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,to find thy home.'
3464,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,
3465,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,"""The next morning, I sought the aged sea-god as I had been bidden."
3466,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,"I took three old comrades whom I knew to be trusty, and we went down"
3467,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,into the depths of the sea. The goddess brought us four fresh hides
3468,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,"that had just been taken from sea-calves newly slaughtered, and we"
3469,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,dressed ourselves in them to deceive her father. She scooped out
3470,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,places for us to lie in on the sands and we waited for him to come.
3471,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,"The smell was sickening and beyond endurance, so the goddess put"
3472,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,"ambrosia under our noses. When the sun was highest in the heavens,"
3473,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,the sea-calves came in groups and ranged themselves around in rows
3474,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,"on the sand. The old seer came out and counted all, and did not notice"
3475,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,"our fraud. Then he lay down to sleep. At once, we rushed upon him"
3476,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,"and caught him. He began to take all kinds of shapes. First, he was"
3477,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,"a lion; then a serpent, a panther, a boar, a fountain of water, and"
3478,MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES,a tree. We held on until he was tired of trying to escape.

3515,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"One day while Telemachos was in Sparta, the guest of Menelaos, the"
3516,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,suitors were more riotous than usual. They diverted themselves in
3517,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,the palace of Odysseus by throwing the discus and javelin. Only
3518,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"Antinoös and the handsome Eurymachos kept apart from them. Then Noëmon,"
3519,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"who had given Telemachos his ship a few days before, approached them"
3520,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"and said: ""Antinoös, I would gladly know when Telemachos will return"
3521,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"from Pylos. I lent him my ship, and I need it for I intend to go to"

3523,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,
3524,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"The suitors were completely taken by surprise, for they had not heard"
3525,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,that Telemachos had gone to Pylos. They thought that he was out at
3526,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"the farm with his swineherd. Antinoös asked: ""When did Telemachos"
3527,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"sail, and what crew did he take? Did he use force in getting thy ship"
3528,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"or didst thou lend it willingly?"""
3529,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,
3530,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"""He was welcome to the ship,"" replied Noëmon. ""Who would not have"
3531,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,done such a service to a man who has had so much to endure? The young
3532,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"men who went with him belong to the best families of Ithaca."" Noëmon"
3533,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"could not get any news of Telemachos, so he went home; but the suitors"
3534,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,conspired to kill Telemachos. They decided that Antinoös should man
3535,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"a ship with a crew of twenty men, and lie in ambush in the waters"
3536,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"near Ithaca, in order that they might catch Telemachos, on his return."
3537,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,
3538,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"This wicked plot of the suitors was betrayed to the queen, by her"
3539,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"faithful herald, Medon. Penelope was overcome with grief, and wept"
3540,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"bitterly, and her loyal attendants mourned with her. ""What new grief"
3541,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"is this which befalls me now?"" she said. ""Is it not enough that death"
3542,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"has robbed me of my husband? Am I also to lose my only child, without"
3543,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,even having seen him before his departure? Alas! why did no one tell
3544,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"me he was going, that I might have prevented his journey? Haste ye"
3545,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"to Laertes and tell him what has happened, that he may make some plan"

3547,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,
3548,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"Then Eurycleia, the nurse, tried to console her with these soothing"

3550,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"I gave Telemachos a generous supply of food and wine, all that he"
3551,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,could use on his journey. And I promised him solemnly that I would
3552,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"not tell thee of his departure, since he had a great dread that thou"
3553,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"wouldst weep and mourn, and spoil thy lovely face and injure thy health."
3554,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"Now dry thy tears and bathe, and put on fresh robes. Then go to thine"

3557,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,
3558,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"Penelope followed the old nurse's advice. She went to the altar, at"
3559,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"the highest part of the house, and there she prayed to Athena: ""Hear"
3560,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"me, daughter of Zeus! If ever my beloved husband has sacrificed to"
3561,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"thee the fat limbs of oxen or sheep, and has built thee altars, save"
3562,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"my son, Telemachos, and destroy the suitors, who fain would destroy"
3563,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"him."" The goddess heard her prayer, and sent sweet slumber and a"
3564,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"pleasant dream to assuage her grief. In her sleep she saw her sister,"
3565,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"who said to her: ""Be of good cheer, Penelope; no harm will come to"
3566,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"thy son, for a god goes with him."" To her, the wise Penelope, yet"
3567,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"dreaming, answered: ""My sister, why is it thou hast never come to"

3569,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"husband, and now his enemies conspire to slay my only son."" The dream"
3570,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"replied: ""Take heart. Do not fear. Athena sent me to tell thee that"

3572,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,
3573,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"""Oh, tell me,"" cried the queen, in her dreams, ""tell me if my husband"
3574,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"lives, since thou art sent by a goddess."" But the shadow vanished"
3575,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"through the closed door, and mingled with the air. Penelope awoke"
3576,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"with a glad heart, cheered by the prophetic dream."
3577,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,
3578,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"In the meantime the suitors spoke among themselves, for they were"
3579,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"too foolish to understand the spirit of the queen. ""Surely,"" they"

3583,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"men, and they went down to a well-fitted ship, and took their places"
3584,THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS,"at the oars. They waited until it was dark, when they quietly rowed"

3598,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO ITHACA,since Penelope's father had given her counsel to wed the richest of

3614,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO ITHACA,"son of Nestor."" But Peisistratos begged him to wait until it was fairly"
3615,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO ITHACA,"light. Menelaos had slept lightly, he was so agitated with the great"
3616,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO ITHACA,"event of seeing his beloved comrade's son, and he rose as soon as"
3617,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO ITHACA,"it was light. Telemachos heard him approaching, and hastily threw"

3619,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO ITHACA,
3620,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO ITHACA,Telemachos urged a hasty departure and Menelaos did not think it
3621,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO ITHACA,"proper to try to detain him. He said: ""A host is hateful who is too"
3622,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO ITHACA,affectionate. It is as wrong to keep a guest who is in a hurry to

3626,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO ITHACA,"goblet, a silver beaker, a robe that glistened with hand-wrought"
3627,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO ITHACA,"embroidery, the work of Helen, a goblet of silver with golden lips."
3628,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO ITHACA,Peisistratos gazed with wonder at their beauty as he placed them in

3630,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO ITHACA,
3631,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO ITHACA,They washed their hands in a silver bowl and ate and drank from the

3633,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO ITHACA,which had been brought to the palace gates. Nestor's son took the

3635,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO ITHACA,"for their safety and prosperity, and off they sped over the plain."
3636,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO ITHACA,"Two birds flew on before them, an eagle that had clutched a goose"

3669,TELEMACHOS AND THE SWINEHERD,"Tears dropped from his eyes and he said: ""My dear Telemachos, I did"

3671,TELEMACHOS AND THE SWINEHERD,with all my heart at seeing thee once more enter my cabin after thy

3679,TELEMACHOS AND THE SWINEHERD,
3680,TELEMACHOS AND THE SWINEHERD,"""Thy mother is still at home,"" replied the sturdy swineherd. ""She"

3682,TELEMACHOS AND THE SWINEHERD,"he took the lance from the young prince, who had come farther into"

3689,TELEMACHOS AND THE SWINEHERD,"when he had eaten, asked his faithful servant who the stranger was"

3691,TELEMACHOS AND THE SWINEHERD,
3692,TELEMACHOS AND THE SWINEHERD,"""The stranger says that he came from Crete,"" answered Eumaios. ""Lately"

3726,TELEMACHOS RECOGNIZES ODYSSEUS,"to come outside. Telemachos was opposite to her, but he did not see"

3736,TELEMACHOS RECOGNIZES ODYSSEUS,When she had finished speaking she touched Odysseus with her golden

3766,TELEMACHOS RECOGNIZES ODYSSEUS,Odysseus sat down and his dear son approached him and threw his arms

3768,TELEMACHOS RECOGNIZES ODYSSEUS,"At last Telemachos inquired: ""Dear father, in what ship hast thou"

3827,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,"where he may beg, and thus supply his wants. I cannot receive every"

3833,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,"myself it is better for me to go to the city, where a beggar may have"

3838,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,Then Telemachos went out of the lodge and sped toward the city. His
3839,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,"old nurse, Eurycleia, was the first to see him, and she ran out to"
3840,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,"welcome him, and the other servants came around rejoicing. Next came"
3841,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,"Penelope, as beautiful as Artemis, and threw her arms about her son,"
3842,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,"and kissed him on his brow and eyes. ""Hast thou indeed returned,"
3843,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,"Telemachos, my son? I never hoped to see thee again. Tell me about"

3851,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,"her son's bidding, but Telemachos betook himself to the market place"
3852,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,to show himself to the people.

3854,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,When Telemachos came into the public square the suitors thronged
3855,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,"around him with smooth speeches, but in their hearts they kept on"
3856,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,"plotting his death. He wanted them to see that he was in Ithaca, but"
3857,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,"he did not care to be in their company, so he took his place among"
3858,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,some friends of his father. One of the crew came up to ask where he
3859,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,"might deposit the splendid gifts of Menelaos, and Telemachos told"
3860,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,him to hide them until the suitors had been defeated or had won the
3861,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,victory.
3862,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,
3863,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,Then Telemachos came back to the palace in company with a stranger
3864,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,"who had joined his crew at Pylos, and they sat down near the queen,"
3865,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,"who was spinning. The servants brought them wine and food, and after"
3866,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,"they had eaten, Penelope begged that her son would recite to her the"
3867,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,story of his journey. In the meantime Odysseus and Eumaios had started
3868,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,for the city. When they reached the spring where the citizens of the
3869,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,"city went for water, they encountered Melanthios, a goatherd, driving"
3870,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,"goats into town. Two servants followed, helping him. As soon as he"
3871,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,"saw Eumaios and his guest, he said: ""Look! There is one knave leading"
3872,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,"another. Verily, the gods bring like and like together. Thou miserable"
3873,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,"swineherd, whither dost thou take that worthless beggar, this"
3874,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,"vagabond who rubs his shoulders on every door-post, asking for crusts,"
3875,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,"eating gluttonously, and telling tales of woe?"

3877,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,"""Just hand him over to me to guard my stables and clean my yard, and"
3878,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,"I will give him whey to drink, which will fatten his limbs. But work"
3879,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,does not suit such a fellow. He would rather ramble idly about and
3880,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,beg for food to fill his empty stomach. Let him once come to the palace
3881,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,of Odysseus and the guests that woo the queen will fling footstools
3882,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,"at him."" With that Melanthios kicked him in the thigh. Odysseus"
3883,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,hesitated a moment and considered whether it were better to slay the
3884,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,"goatherd with a blow from his staff, or whether he should submit to"
3885,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,the indignity in silence. The latter seemed the better course.
3886,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,
3887,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,"But Eumaios grew angry and said: ""Melanthios, wait till Odysseus"
3888,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,"returns. He will give thee thy deserts, thou villain! All day long"
3889,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,"dost thou loaf in the city, leaving thy master's flocks to take care"
3890,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,"of themselves."" Melanthios answered him: ""Just hear what this cur"
3891,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,has to say! I shall take him off and sell him for a slave some day.
3892,TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE,Would that Telemachos might die this moment under the hands of the

3923,ODYSSEUS IS RECOGNIZED BY HIS DOG,"There, on the unwholesome heap, a poor, neglected dog was lying,"

4281,ATHENA ENCOURAGES ODYSSEUS,"She prayed aloud, and soon daylight appeared. Odysseus heard the voice"
4282,ATHENA ENCOURAGES ODYSSEUS,and it filled his heart with anxiety. He arose and hastily placed
4283,ATHENA ENCOURAGES ODYSSEUS,the rugs on which he had slept on a bench in the palace. Then he went
4284,ATHENA ENCOURAGES ODYSSEUS,"out into the open air. Telemachos had risen also, and he went forth"
4285,ATHENA ENCOURAGES ODYSSEUS,to the market-place. Eurycleia called the servants together and
4286,ATHENA ENCOURAGES ODYSSEUS,"ordered them to be quick about their work, for a festival was to be"
4287,ATHENA ENCOURAGES ODYSSEUS,celebrated that day and the wooers would come early.
4288,ATHENA ENCOURAGES ODYSSEUS,
4289,ATHENA ENCOURAGES ODYSSEUS,"There was a busy time. The menials obeyed, some bringing water, some"
4290,ATHENA ENCOURAGES ODYSSEUS,"sweeping the floors, others polishing the benches and covering them"
4291,ATHENA ENCOURAGES ODYSSEUS,with royal tapestries. The servants of the suitors came also and cut
4292,ATHENA ENCOURAGES ODYSSEUS,"wood for the fires. Eumaios arrived early, driving three fat hogs."
4293,ATHENA ENCOURAGES ODYSSEUS,He saluted Odysseus and asked him if he were well treated by the
4294,ATHENA ENCOURAGES ODYSSEUS,"suitors, or if they continued to scoff at him. Odysseus answered him:"
4295,ATHENA ENCOURAGES ODYSSEUS,"""May the gods punish the ruthless men who perpetrate such wrongs in"
4296,ATHENA ENCOURAGES ODYSSEUS,"a stranger's home."" While they were talking together the goatherd"

4298,ATHENA ENCOURAGES ODYSSEUS,"Odysseus took no notice of it, except to shake his head as one who"

4301,ATHENA ENCOURAGES ODYSSEUS,The master herdsman now came along with a fat heifer and choice goats
4302,ATHENA ENCOURAGES ODYSSEUS,"for the day's banquet. Offering his hand to Odysseus, he exclaimed:"
4303,ATHENA ENCOURAGES ODYSSEUS,"""Hail to thee, stranger! A long and happy life be thine! Methinks"
4304,ATHENA ENCOURAGES ODYSSEUS,my master must be clothed in rags and wandering like thee. Thou dost

4333,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,It does not become any one of us to begrudge good things to the guests

4337,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,
4338,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,Odysseus dodged it by holding down his head. Telemachos grew angry
4339,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,"and rebuked the suitor in these words: ""Ktesippos, thou hast escaped"

4344,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,
4345,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,Dreadful forebodings of woe began to fill the hearts of the suitors.
4346,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,Their speech became rambling and they laughed insanely. They ate and
4347,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,drank like men deranged.
4348,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,
4349,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,Penelope now entered the great hall and took her seat upon a
4350,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,"magnificent throne, right in front of the suitors. She heard the"
4351,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,maudlin laughter and saw the gluttonous feasting as the revel ran
4352,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,"high. Then Athena came and moved her mind to immediate action, and"
4353,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,"she went up to the farthest chamber with her maids, where the arms"
4354,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,"of Odysseus were stored. His bow and deadly arrows, so long unused,"
4355,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,"were there, with rich treasures and perfumed garments. She wept as"
4356,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,"she took the bow from its case and went out, followed by the servants,"
4357,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,"who carried down costly prizes, such as Odysseus gave when festivals"

4359,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,
4360,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,"She took her place, standing before the suitors, and addressed them:"

4366,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,
4367,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,Penelope called to the swineherd and the herdsmen to place the rings
4368,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,"and carry the bow to the suitors. Each in turn tried to do so, but"
4369,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,"were overcome with grief at seeing their master's weapons, and laid"

4384,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,Telemachos took off his cloak and laid his sword aside. He placed
4385,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,the axes in a row and took the bow and made three attempts to bend
4386,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,"it, but did not succeed. He would have accomplished the feat if he"
4387,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,"had made one more effort, but Odysseus made a sign to him to desist,"
4388,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,so he set the bow against the wall and went back to his seat.
4389,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,
4390,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,The first suitor to make the trial had never been pleased with the
4391,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,"insolence of the wooers, and had great foresight and was called their"
4392,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,"seer. His hands were soft and delicate. He could not bend the bow,"
4393,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,but he predicted that it would be the instrument to bring death to
4394,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,the whole crew.
4395,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,
4396,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,"Antinoös reproached him for his prophecies, and ordered Melanthios"
4397,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,"to light a fire and bring a slice of fat, that the bow might be warmed"
4398,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,"and oiled to make it pliable. They warmed it and rubbed it with oil,"
4399,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,"and tried to bend it. One after another, each in turn, they made trials,"
4400,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,but all in vain.
4401,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,
4402,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,In the meantime Odysseus went to the swineherd and the master of the
4403,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,"herds, who had displayed such loyalty. He said to them: ""My friends,"
4404,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,"what if Odysseus should come; would you take part with him, or join"
4405,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,"the crowd of suitors? Speak truly."" The two men answered, appealing"
4406,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,"to the gods to bear witness, that they would stand by their master"
4407,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,to the end.
4408,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,

4412,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,you may surely recognize me I will show you the scar made by a boar
4413,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,"on Parnassos."" He raised his ragged tunic for a moment and they looked"
4414,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,"at the scar. They recognized their long-lost master, and threw their"

4416,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,
4417,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,"Odysseus begged them to desist, lest the suitors should notice it"
4418,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,and discover him. And he instructed them to bring the bow to him and
4419,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,"place it in his hands, after all the wooers had failed to bend it."
4420,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,"And he told them to shut and lock the doors, so that the maid-servants"
4421,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,"could not hear the groans of the dying men, for they might run out"
4422,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,and warn the town.
4423,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,
4424,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,Eurymachos and Antinoös were the last to make trial of the bow.
4425,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,"Eurymachos sat before the fire and warmed it on both sides, but he"
4426,THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS,"could not bend it. He was vexed beyond measure, and said: ""It is not"

4555,ODYSSEUS BENDS THE BOW,"fell upon the table, upsetting it, and he went spinning round with"
4556,ODYSSEUS BENDS THE BOW,"it on the paved floor, while the food and cup of wine were scattered"
4557,ODYSSEUS BENDS THE BOW,all about. His head struck upon a stone and his feet against a chair.
4558,ODYSSEUS BENDS THE BOW,Death closed his eyes.
4559,ODYSSEUS BENDS THE BOW,
4560,ODYSSEUS BENDS THE BOW,Another suitor drew his sword and rushed toward Odysseus. Telemachos
4561,ODYSSEUS BENDS THE BOW,met him with a lance and slew him. Then Telemachos sprang to his
4562,ODYSSEUS BENDS THE BOW,"father's side and said: ""My father, I will bring thee javelins and"
4563,ODYSSEUS BENDS THE BOW,"a shield, and I will arm myself and the swineherd and the master"
4564,ODYSSEUS BENDS THE BOW,"herdsmen."" ""Make haste, my son,"" responded Odysseus, ""for I have but"
4565,ODYSSEUS BENDS THE BOW,"few arrows left."""
4566,ODYSSEUS BENDS THE BOW,
4567,ODYSSEUS BENDS THE BOW,Telemachos hastened to the room where the arms had been stored and
4568,ODYSSEUS BENDS THE BOW,clothed himself in brass. His loyal herdsmen also put on splendid
4569,ODYSSEUS BENDS THE BOW,"armor, and they hastened back to Odysseus with a complete outfit for"
4570,ODYSSEUS BENDS THE BOW,"him. The chief had used up his arrows, and now he dressed himself"
4571,ODYSSEUS BENDS THE BOW,in armor and took the lances. Just then he perceived that the suitors
4572,ODYSSEUS BENDS THE BOW,had by some means been supplied with armor also. He called to
4573,ODYSSEUS BENDS THE BOW,"Telemachos, who had left the door ajar leading to the apartment where"
4574,ODYSSEUS BENDS THE BOW,the arms had been placed for safety.
4575,ODYSSEUS BENDS THE BOW,
4576,ODYSSEUS BENDS THE BOW,"Melanthios, the goatherd, had sneaked in and was slyly bringing"
4577,ODYSSEUS BENDS THE BOW,"shields and helmets down to them. Telemachos saw him, and gave orders"
4578,ODYSSEUS BENDS THE BOW,to the herdsmen to lock the doors of the armory and secure the spy.
4579,ODYSSEUS BENDS THE BOW,"They hastened to the armory and found Melanthios, who had come back"
4580,ODYSSEUS BENDS THE BOW,for a second load. They cast him on the floor and tied his arms down
4581,ODYSSEUS BENDS THE BOW,so that he could not move them. Then they took a rope and made two
4582,ODYSSEUS BENDS THE BOW,"loops in it and swung him safely to the timbers in the roof, saying:"
4583,ODYSSEUS BENDS THE BOW,"""Melanthios, thou hast a soft bed, and it is where thou canst keep"

4603,DEATH OF THE SUITORS,
4604,DEATH OF THE SUITORS,"Athena said this to spur Odysseus on, but she did not remain at his"

4606,DEATH OF THE SUITORS,"of the great hall, to put his prowess to a greater test. When she"
4607,DEATH OF THE SUITORS,"had gone, the suitors grew braver and threw their spears at Odysseus"
4608,DEATH OF THE SUITORS,"thick and fast. But their aim was uncertain, and they struck pillars"

4610,DEATH OF THE SUITORS,
4611,DEATH OF THE SUITORS,Odysseus and Telemachos and their faithful servants hurled their

4616,DEATH OF THE SUITORS,
4617,DEATH OF THE SUITORS,Four of the wooers fell to the ground at once and the remainder
4618,DEATH OF THE SUITORS,retreated to the farthest corner of the hall. Still they rallied for
4619,DEATH OF THE SUITORS,another onset. Odysseus rushed in upon them and cut them down right
4620,DEATH OF THE SUITORS,"and left, while Athena from above shook her fearful ægis. The"
4621,DEATH OF THE SUITORS,surviving wooers were stricken with terror and ran about like a herd
4622,DEATH OF THE SUITORS,of oxen chased by a swarm of gadflies. Only the minstrel Phemios and
4623,DEATH OF THE SUITORS,the herald Medon were spared. Both of them had served the suitors
4624,DEATH OF THE SUITORS,most unwillingly and had secretly advised with Telemachos.
4625,DEATH OF THE SUITORS,
4626,DEATH OF THE SUITORS,Odysseus searched up and down the hall to see if any suitor could
4627,DEATH OF THE SUITORS,be found alive. As fishes lie upon the beach when they have been poured
4628,DEATH OF THE SUITORS,"out from the nets upon the sand, so lay the multitude of wooers. Not"
4629,DEATH OF THE SUITORS,one survived.
4630,DEATH OF THE SUITORS,
4631,DEATH OF THE SUITORS,Then Odysseus called Eurycleia and bade her summon all of the impudent
4632,DEATH OF THE SUITORS,and unfaithful servants who had taken sides with the suitors. They
4633,DEATH OF THE SUITORS,came into the hall and with loud laments took up the slain and carried
4634,DEATH OF THE SUITORS,"them out as they were commanded, and placed them in a walled court."
4635,DEATH OF THE SUITORS,"Then they cleaned the hall with water and sponges, and polished the"

4637,DEATH OF THE SUITORS,
4638,DEATH OF THE SUITORS,"When this was done, they were driven like a flock of birds into a"

4640,DEATH OF THE SUITORS,also was brought down from the armory and cast among the dogs to die.
4641,DEATH OF THE SUITORS,
4642,DEATH OF THE SUITORS,"The palace now was purged with the smoke of sulphur, and the air was"
